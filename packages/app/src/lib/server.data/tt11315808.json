        "3122000 3130000 It's my view that there is absolutely no evidence that Arthur Fleck suffers from multiple personality disorder",
        "3130000 3140000 Or that he ever behaved in the role of joker as a separate personality dissociated from himself",
        "3140000 3145000 Doctor? In your opinion, concerning the work he did on this case",
        "3145000 3150000 Do you believe Mr. Fleck suffers from a mental disease or defect?",
        "3150000 3158000 No. In my opinion, he's not psychotic or unable to test reality",
        "3158000 3161000 I think he was sane when you committed these crimes",
        "3161000 3167000 In fact, I believe he fakes his mental illness",
        "3167000 3171000 Why?",
        "3171000 3178000 And if he's, uh, faking it, as you say",
        "3178000 3183000 Then what is your opinion on the defendant's mental condition?",
        "3183000 3192000 I believe he has four relatively minor and quite common mental disorders that involve long standing sadness",
        "3192000 3196000 Narcissistic self-centeredness, friendlessness",
        "3196000 3199000 And indifference to the feelings of others",
        "3199000 3202000 This is a very disturbed individual",

        "3250000 3252000 That that's not who he is",
        "3252000 3260000 Well, I also reviewed all the test results, psychological tests, neurological and medical tests",
        "3260000 3264000 And in my view, it's just a performance",
        "3264000 3269000 Did you read the records from the Department of Social Services",
        "3269000 3277000 That show that when Arthur was seven years old, they returned him to his abuser's home",
        "3277000 3279000 His mother's home",
        "3279000 3282000 I did, yes",
        "3282000 3286000 And when you interviewed him for 89 minutes",
        "3286000 3298000 Did you ask him why social services didn't believe the horrific stories a seven year old boy told him about the physical and sexual of abuse he suffered?",
        "3298000 3299000 Yeah",
        "3299000 3303000 Applause",

        "3325000 3328000 Applause",
        "3329000 3336000 No, I didn't ask him about that",
        "3336000 3353000 So you want us to believe that after spending just 89 minutes with Arthur Fleck and reading through his records and tests from the same government agencies that abandoned him",
        "3353000 3363000 You want us to believe that you can say with absolute certainty that Arthur doesn't suffer from any serious mental illness",
        "3363000 3373000 That he didn't need to retreat into fantasy and create another identity to protect that scared, vulnerable",
        "3373000 3378000 Seven year old boy from all the trauma and abuse he suffered",
        "3378000 3383000 And that that identity didn't come out again",

        "3433000 3439000 Mrs. Kane, please continue reading from the highlighted portion",
        "3439000 3445000 Then I remember Sophie had another dream about her, forgot it",
        "3445000 3450000 I almost never dreamed, what do I got to do to remember?",
        "3450000 3455000 That's Sophie Dumont, Mr. Fleck's neighbor whom he was obsessed with",
        "3455000 3459000 What was that date? November 17",
        "3459000 3468000 Well, the record show, November 17th is the date of Mr. Fleck stabbed Randall Kleinman Hoffer to death",
        "3468000 3475000 The very same day that he shot and killed Murray Frank",
        "3475000 3482000 Now, I know it's not your area of expertise, but you have read all of Mr. Fleck's journal before, correct?",
        "3482000 3484000 Yes, I have",
        "3484000 3490000 And, in your opinion, does this sound like a different voice?",
        "3490000 3496000 Like a different personality, wrote this?",
        "3496000 3499000 No, it sounds like Arthur",
        "3499000 3501000 Go on",
        "3501000 3505000 He often wrote about his fantasies",
        "3505000 3511000 And the women he had imaginary relationships with",
        "3511000 3514000 And of course his jokes",
        "3514000 3522000 There are always a lot of these unfunny jokes",
        "3522000 3527000 There's justice, so I don't think she's even qualified to do that",
        "3527000 3529000 You know, you're making him out to be a fucking idiot in there",
        "3530000 3532000 He's never gonna get out if he keep this shit up",
        "3532000 3535000 Ask her why she has me sitting so far away from him",
        "3535000 3537000 Let's not do this here",
        "3537000 3539000 Do you see all those people out front?",
        "3539000 3541000 Who do you think they're here for?",

        "3543000 3545000 How many signs?",
        "3545000 3550000 It's the tale of the century and she doesn't even know who her own client is",

        "3559000 3562000 You don't really think he's just gonna walk out of here, do you?",
        "3562000 3565000 Yeah, he's gonna walk right out of here",
        "3565000 3567000 With me by his side",
