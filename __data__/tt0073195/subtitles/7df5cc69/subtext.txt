12262 15380 Ellen, you burned another pot.<br />You're a fire hazard.
16058 18015 I never hear the whistle.
20062 21143 Feed the dogs, will you?
21230 24439 Don't be a grouch. I'm a wonderful<br />person. Enjoy what you've got.
24525 25811 Whose clothes are those?<br />Yours.
25901 27812 If you were a dog bowl,<br />where would you be?
27903 29439 I'm taking them to the thrift shop.
29530 31020 It's Mrs. Vaughn's<br />pet charity.
31114 32946 That's not gonna help you in this town.
33033 36242 Look through that, see what you<br />want. It's mostly your city clothes.
36328 37534 Okay, guys, come on.
39581 40662 Here you go.
41542 43909 Hey, I wear this to the Garden.
47756 49372 Locked doors.
49758 51590 Garbage strikes.
53470 55381 Dog dirt and muggers.
58600 59886 Ship it.
61353 62889 Christine what?
63105 64391 Um...
65732 67314 You don't remember her name?
70737 74776 What's that name for people<br />who come over from the mainland?
74866 76857 Uh, tourists?<br />Summer dinks?
76952 78363 That's it.
79162 82029 So you picked her up at the<br />ferry. How many were in the group?
82124 83740 Urn, about 20 of us.
83834 85245 Spent the night on the beach?
85335 86666 Most of it.
86837 88874 Nobody saw her go into the water?
88964 92127 Somebody could've.<br />I was sort of passed out.
92259 93590 You mean, she ran out on you?
93719 95005 No, sir.
95554 97170 She must've drowned.
97264 99380 Look, I reported it to you, didn't I?
101226 102716 You live here?
102853 104343 No. Hartford.
104438 106805 I go to Trinity.<br />My folks live in Greenwich.
106940 108351 Your parents were born here?
108442 110900 Yeah, but they moved off<br />when my father retired.
111069 112685 You an Islander?<br />No. New York City.
112779 114235 You here for the summer?
114406 115896 Yeah, me and some friends got a house.
115991 117732 What are you paying?
117909 119650 Oh, um, $1,000 each.<br />There's five of us.
119745 122157 Uh, $100 a week for food, booze.
122247 123487 That's pretty expensive.
123624 124864 It's not bad.
127377 128538 Come on.
137429 138510 Action.
161370 162451 You're gonna have to take a look at this.
162537 163572 No.
164039 164999 I don't want to.
165082 166117 Please.
167250 169412 You're going to have to take a look at it.
170212 171543 Is it her?
171630 173120 That's what you're going to tell me.
173256 174746 I don't want to look.
174841 177924 Please, just take a look<br />and tell me if that's her.
198990 200071 Cut!
200867 202232 What have you got there?
202327 205365 Listen, we had a shark attack at<br />South Beach this morning, Mayor.
205455 207446 Fatal. I have to<br />batten down the beach.
207541 209031 Who have you told this to, Lenny?
209126 210207 I just found out about it.
210293 212034 There are some Boy Scouts in the water
212129 213836 a couple of miles down the coast
213922 216664 from where we found the girl.<br />Chief went to dry them off.
216758 218499 We'll take my car.<br />Come with us.
218593 219754 But I gotta do these signs...
219845 222633 Come, it'll give us time to<br />think of what the signs will say.
223473 224713 Action!
226810 228767 Okay. You can<br />take us back now.
234609 237226 I tell you, I can't do my job in a vacuum.
237654 239895 If this is what you want, you<br />should have hired Hendricks.
239990 241355 He's got relatives all over the island.
241450 243782 We hired the right man, Martin.
243869 247032 We didn't need someone<br />with old feuds, family ties.
247122 249113 We need someone to referee this thing.
250000 251240 All right.
251334 253871 Let me tell you about<br />some of the vandalism
253962 255873 that's been going on, on this island.
255964 258171 You know the white picket<br />fence around my office?
258300 261918 Apparently the little cookers are<br />coming with karate chops or something
262012 263218 I don't know what...
264598 267010 Kids are breaking my whole fence.
268059 269265 You're such a...
283366 285232 Where's the... Daddy! Uh...
285327 287193 Right this way.
318485 320146 Okay.<br />I put in a number three.
320278 321985 That should be softer than the number two.
324115 325115 Try it now.
326827 327942 Hello, Mr. Quint.
328036 329447 How are you, Katie?
329538 331154 Looking well.<br />Thank you.
331248 332579 Four spools of piano wire, number 12.
332666 333952 Sure.
334042 336124 What do those fish do?<br />Eat that stuff?
336211 337497 No, they choke on it.
380005 381837 So then Denherder and Charlie
381965 383797 sat there trying to catch their breath
383884 385921 and figure out how to tell Charlie's wife
386011 387968 what happened to her freezer full of meat.
388054 390341 That's not funny.<br />That's not funny at all.
390432 393345 Mrs. Kintner must've put<br />her ad in <i>Field &</i> Stream.
393435 395142 <i>Looks more like The National Enquirer.</i>
396396 399559 All right, hold on a minute.<br />Hold everything. I said, hold it!
405572 407483 The price is $100.
407908 409023 As a unit.
411161 412447 That's $35.
420670 423002 Why don't you wait<br />till you get out a little farther, huh?
423089 424329 Grab that...
424424 425585 Wait a minute.<br />You have a permit for that?
425675 426756 Yes, sir.
426843 427843 Okay. Keep the safety on.
431598 432884 Marker.
433016 434302 Action.
436186 440054 Holy Jesus H. Christ,<br />look at this bunch of nuts.
440148 443106 Fit for trout fishing, clam digging,
443526 444857 rabbit hunting,
446363 447728 bass fishing,
448239 450446 everything...<br />Get that guy, Chief.
450533 451694 Wait a minute.<br />You got a permit for that?
451785 452900 Yes, sir.
452994 454530 All right.<br />Just keep the safety on.
455288 457370 And the more they come,<br />the worse they look.
457457 459573 You're not going out, too, are you?
459668 463036 Yeah. $3,000 is a lot of<br />money, and I'd like to have it.
463129 465666 I can certainly use it.<br />Look out, Chief.
474015 476882 You aren't going out with that<br />bunch of crazy nuts, are you?
476977 478217 I don't know yet.
485986 487818 Come on! Go get him!<br />Come on!
491449 494282 I think Harry's got it.<br />Let's go!
505088 506795 Get him up!
509551 510837 I got him!
539956 541788 Come on.<br />Would you give me a hand?
542625 544207 Get them out of here.
555013 556219 Get it over here.
572530 574112 Get away from the shark.
576076 577191 Marker.
581081 582822 Take a deep breath, Lorraine.
589089 591126 Did you see the television special,
591216 593253 the Cousteau special on sea otters
593343 596256 where the mother was killed<br />in front of the baby?
596346 599589 The baby saw it. You could see<br />the tears coming down its face.
599682 602140 It was the most incredible<br />thing I've ever seen, but terrible.
602227 604889 Mikey wanted us to adopt the sea otter.
604979 609098 I've never been this moved by<br />anything on television. It was really...
609901 611062 It was special.
614280 615896 So, you're going on the Aurora.
615990 618152 You're gonna live there 18 months.
620161 621617 So she would go,
624290 628158 Like that. I mean, she<br />was a whacko. She was really smooth.
628878 630710 All this was happening during finals week.
630797 633038 She had my long-distance<br />telephone credit card.
633133 634919 And my father called up one day
635009 636750 and said, "What is<br />this $1,200 phone bill?"
636886 638923 What was I going to tell him? That<br />I knew some bozo
639013 640595 Into erotic phone calls?
640682 643299 She was driving me nuts.<br />She was great.
662287 663368 What was that?
664080 665536 I didn't hear anything.
677844 679676 Try breathing through your mouth.
686895 689853 I quit, Mr. Quint.
693401 695267 You don't go, you don't get paid.
695361 697193 I don't care.<br />Cut.
699574 703568 I'm not going on that old<br />slab after that crazy old shark.
705038 706403 I'm not crazy.
708041 710829 You miserable little son of a bitch.
711294 712830 You get that black fish on my boat.
712921 715128 Pump out the bilges, top up the fuel tanks
715215 717877 then get your ass out of here<br />because you're on the beach.
723431 724671 Beautiful. Cut it.
