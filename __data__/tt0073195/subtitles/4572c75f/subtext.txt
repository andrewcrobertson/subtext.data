1278194 1279527 Got to bring back<br />the tourists
1279612 1282697 that'll put<br />all your businesses<br />on a paying basis.
1283532 1285784 But it's not<br />going to be pleasant.
1285868 1289037 I value my neck<br />a lot more than<br />$3,000, Chief.
1289872 1294376 I'll find him for $3,000,<br />but I'll catch him and<br />kill him for $10,000.
1295002 1297003 You got to<br />make up your minds.
1297546 1299547 Gonna stay alive<br />and ante up,
1299632 1303218 gonna play it cheap<br />and be on welfare<br />the whole winter.
1304720 1307055 I don't want no volunteers.<br />I don't want no mates.
1307181 1310058 There's too many captains<br />on this island.
1310559 1312894 $10,000 for me,<br />by myself.
1313729 1318400 For that,<br />you get the head, the tail,<br />the whole damn thing.
1322363 1324739 Thank you very much,<br />Mr. Quint.
1326075 1328910 We'll take it<br />under advisement.

1382131 1385300 I mean, if they live<br />2,000, 3,000 years...<br />They don't know.
1385426 1387594 Enough.

1410951 1413286 Mikey really<br />loves his present.
1414622 1416122 Where is he?
1416207 1417332 Sitting in it.
1420503 1421836 Good God.
1425674 1427967 All right, Michael,<br />out of the boat!
1428969 1432180 Tied up to the jetties,<br />sitting in the boat.
1432264 1433723 I'm helping Michael.
1434141 1435433 Get out of that boat!
1435518 1438186 Hi, Dad. Just a little<br />longer. Please?
1438312 1439771 It's his birthday.
1439855 1440855 I don't want him<br />on the ocean!
1440981 1442732 He's not on the ocean,<br />he is in a boat.
1442817 1444192 He won't go<br />in the water.
1444318 1448696 I don't think he'll<br />go in the water again,<br />after what happened yesterday.
1450074 1452408 All right,<br />now don't say that.
1452743 1455745 I don't want that<br />to happen,<br />you know that.
1457206 1459124 I want him to read<br />the boating regulations,
1459208 1462377 the rules, before he<br />goes out on his own.
1462545 1466840 Michael,<br />did you hear your father?<br />Out of the water now!

1479353 1483022 DENHERDER: Don't worry.<br />The Chief lives on the other<br />side of the island.
1483190 1485400 Am I coming in straight?

1669084 1672837 So then Denherder and Charlie<br />sat there trying to<br />catch their breath
1672921 1675173 and figure out how<br />to tell Charlie's wife
1675257 1677216 what happened to her<br />freezer full of meat.

1717007 1718758 I got a paddle.<br />Scull it out of here.

1723472 1725890 How many guys<br />are you going to<br />put aboard that boat?

1733565 1735316 I'm going on the boat.
1735401 1738152 Please, help me<br />get those guys out<br />of the boat, will you?
1738237 1739529 Sure.<br />Come on.

1808849 1810850 Oh. I'm glad<br />to meet you.<br />Me, too.
1810934 1812727 I know you got<br />a lot on your hands.
1812811 1813936 What can we do<br />for you?
1814021 1816814 The best thing to do<br />is to see the remains
1816899 1818441 of the first victim,<br />the girl on the beach.
1818525 1820151 Okay, fine.<br />Just bear with me,<br />will you?
1820235 1821360 Sure.
1822863 1825865 Wait till we get<br />them silly bastards<br />down in that rock pile.
1825949 1827325 There'll be some fun.

1829870 1831579 when they start<br />digging the bottoms out

1844801 1846302 What are they<br />doing back there?

1881338 1883047 The height and weight<br />of the victim
1883131 1886175 can only be estimated<br />from the partial remains.
1887261 1889303 (HOOPER BREATHING HEAVILY)
1891181 1893641 The torso has been<br />severed in mid-thorax.
1893725 1895226 There are no major<br />organs remaining.
1895310 1896894 May I have a glass<br />of water?
1896979 1898187 The right arm<br />has been severed
1898272 1901691 above the elbow<br />with massive tissue loss
1902025 1903818 in the upper musculature.
1904486 1906070 Thank you very much.
1908657 1911826 Partially<br />denuded bone remaining.<br />This was no boat accident.
1911910 1913953 Did you notify<br />the Coast Guard about this?
1914037 1916831 No. It was only<br />local jurisdiction.
1920043 1923629 The left arm, head,<br />the shoulders, sternum
1923714 1925131 and portions of<br />the rib cage are intact.
1925215 1927842 Do not smoke in here.<br />Thank you very much.
1929344 1931262 This is what happens.
1932347 1935516 Indicates<br />the non-frenzy feeding<br />of a large squalus
1935601 1939520 possibly longimanus<br />or Isurus glaucus.
1940939 1944275 The enormous amount<br />of tissue loss prevents<br />any detailed analysis
1944359 1947862 however,<br />the attacking squalus<br />must be considerably larger
1948071 1950448 than any normal squalus<br />found in these waters.
1950532 1952825 Didn't you get out a boat<br />and check these waters?
1952909 1953951 No.
1954036 1955703 Well, this is<br />not a boat accident.
1956038 1959582 And it wasn't any propeller.<br />It wasn't any coral reef.
1959958 1961959 And it wasn't<br />Jack the Ripper.
1964921 1966380 It was a shark.

2053802 2055219 What kind of<br />a shark is that?
2055303 2056470 I don't know.
2056680 2058139 I think it's a mako.
2058223 2059473 It's got a deep throat,<br />Frank.
2059558 2061600 Yeah, but what kind?<br />What kind of shark?
2061685 2062810 Tiger shark.
2064730 2065855 A what?
2065981 2067440 We can start<br />breathing again.
2067524 2068733 Is Ben getting<br />plenty of pictures?
2068817 2070025 Oh, you bet he is.
2070152 2071736 What is this<br />bite radius crap?
2071820 2073195 That is a big mouth.
2073989 2075239 You stuff<br />your frigging head<br />in there, man,
2075323 2078325 and find out if<br />it's a man-eater.
2082497 2084832 All I'm saying is<br />that it may not be<br />the shark.
2084916 2086083 It's just a slight...
2086168 2089628 I want you to meet Matt.<br />This is Larry Vaughn,<br />our mayor.
2089713 2091589 Matt's from<br />the Oceanographic Institute.
2091673 2092631 Nice to meet you.
2092716 2094341 Terrific, huh, Mayor?
2095886 2098721 There are all kinds of<br />sharks in the waters.
2098805 2101015 Hammerheads,<br />white tips,<br />blues, makos.
2101433 2104101 And the chances<br />that these bozos<br />got the exact shark...
2104186 2106103 There are no other<br />sharks like this here.
2106188 2108105 It's 100-to-1.
2108690 2112818 I'm not saying that<br />this is not the shark.<br />It probably is, Martin.
2112903 2115738 It's a man-eater.<br />It's extremely rare<br />for these waters.
2115864 2118365 But the fact is,<br />the bite radius<br />on this animal
2118450 2120910 is different<br />than the wounds<br />on the victim.
2122370 2125080 I want to be sure.<br />You want to be sure.
2125165 2126707 We all want to<br />be sure, okay?
2126792 2128417 What I want to do<br />is very simple.
2128543 2131295 The digestive system<br />of this animal<br />is very slow.
2131379 2132505 Let's cut it open.
2132589 2134507 Whatever it's eaten<br />in the last 24 hours
2134591 2136050 is bound to<br />still be in there.
2136134 2138093 And then we'll be sure.
2143892 2146143 It may be the only way<br />to confirm it.
2146228 2148562 Look, fellows,<br />let's be reasonable.
2149064 2151273 This is not<br />the time or the place
2151399 2154944 to perform some kind<br />of a half-assed autopsy<br />on a fish.
2155821 2159532 And I am not<br />going to stand here<br />and see that thing cut open
2159616 2163494 and see that<br />little Kintner boy<br />spill out all over the dock.

2202784 2204618 You knew<br />it was dangerous.
2204870 2207621 But you let people<br />go swimming anyway.
2212002 2214295 You knew all those things,
2217799 2220050 but still my boy<br />is dead now.
2224389 2227308 And there's nothing<br />you can do about it.
2232981 2234565 My boy is dead.
2240155 2242323 I wanted you<br />to know that.
2248121 2250164 (MELANCHOLIC INSTRUMENTAL<br />MUSIC PLAYING)
2255837 2258213 I'm sorry, Martin.<br />She's wrong.
2259883 2261425 No, she's not.
2266598 2267848 VAUGHN:<br />All right, fellows
2267933 2269892 let's cut this ugly<br />son of a bitch down
2269976 2271894 before it stinks up<br />the whole island.
2272020 2275731 Harve, you and Carl<br />take it out tomorrow<br />and dump it in the drink.

2352475 2353934 Give us a kiss.
2354019 2355144 Why?
2357731 2359481 Because I need it.
2360150 2361775 (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
2363778 2365446 Get out of here.
2366573 2367698 ELLEN: Can I help you?
2367782 2369366 HOOPER: The door was open.<br />Mind if I come in?
2369451 2370993 I'm Matt Hooper.
2371077 2372536 Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.
2372620 2374121 Your husband's home?<br />Yes.
2374205 2375831 I'd really like<br />to talk to him.
2375915 2377499 Yes, so would I.
2378460 2380711 Come in.<br />Can I get you<br />some coffee?
2380795 2382004 No. Nothing, thank you.
2382088 2383756 Oh, wine. How nice.
2402692 2404359 How was your day?
2405695 2407321 (BOTH LAUGHING)
2410241 2411450 Swell.
2414662 2417498 I got red and white.<br />I didn't know what<br />you'd be serving.
2417582 2419041 Oh, that's nice.
2420335 2422294 Is anyone eating this?
2422378 2423587 No.
2431805 2434515 My husband tells me<br />you're in sharks.
2435433 2436558 (LAUGHS)
2437143 2440145 Excuse me. Yes.<br />I've never heard it<br />quite put that way.
2440230 2441730 But yes, I am.
2442190 2443482 I love sharks.
2443566 2444608 You love sharks?
2444692 2446026 Yeah, I love them.
2446111 2448362 When I was 12 years old,<br />my father got me a boat
2448446 2450197 and I went fishing<br />off of Cape Cod.
2450281 2452449 I hooked a scup and<br />as I was reeling it in
2452534 2455369 I hooked a 4.5 foot<br />baby thresher shark
2455453 2457079 who proceeded<br />to eat my boat.
2458581 2462209 He ate my oar, hooks,<br />and my seat cushions.
2462293 2463669 He turned an inboard<br />into an outboard
2463753 2467089 scared me to death,<br />and I swam back to shore.
2467173 2469633 When I was on the beach,<br />I turned around
2469717 2471677 and actually saw<br />my boat being<br />taken apart.
2471761 2474346 Ever since then,<br />I have been<br />studying sharks
2474430 2478183 and that's why I know<br />that I'm going to go<br />to the Institute tomorrow
2478268 2480853 and tell them<br />that you still have<br />a shark problem here.
2480979 2482896 Why do you have<br />to tell them that?<br />Sorry.
2482981 2484606 I'm sorry,<br />I thought that...
2484691 2485983 You told me<br />the shark was caught.
2486067 2488652 I heard it on the news.<br />I heard it on<br />the Cape station.
2488736 2491321 They caught a shark,<br />not the shark.
2491823 2494408 Not the shark that<br />killed Chrissie Watkins.
2494617 2497286 And probably not the shark<br />that killed the little boy.
2497370 2500164 Which I wanted<br />to prove today by<br />cutting the shark open...
2500248 2503333 You may want to let<br />that breathe... Nothing.
2519934 2523270 You know, you'll be<br />the only rational man
2523354 2525063 left on this island<br />after I leave tomorrow.
2525773 2527316 Where are you going?
2528610 2530360 I am going<br />on the Aurora.
2530445 2531862 The Aurora?<br />What is that?
2531946 2534865 It's a floating asylum<br />for shark addicts.
2534949 2536992 It's pure research,<br />18 months at sea.
2537410 2540954 Martin hates boats.<br />Martin hates water.
2541581 2545667 Martin sits in his car<br />when we go on the ferry<br />to the mainland.
2545960 2547961 I guess it's<br />a childhood thing.
2548046 2549713 There's a clinical name<br />for it, isn't there?
2549797 2551256 Drowning.
2552008 2553967 Is it true that most<br />people get attacked
2554052 2556303 by sharks in<br />three feet of water
2556387 2558013 about 10 feet<br />from the beach?
2558097 2559181 Yeah.
2559766 2563310 And that before<br />people started to swim<br />for recreation...
2563394 2566563 I mean, before sharks<br />knew what they were missing
2566648 2569942 that a lot<br />of these attacks<br />weren't reported?
2570026 2571276 That's right.
2573363 2576156 Now this shark<br />that swims alone
2576282 2577449 what's it called?<br />Rogue.
2577533 2578951 Rogue, yeah.
2579410 2582496 This guy,<br />he keeps swimming around
2582580 2584373 in a place where<br />the feeding is good
2584457 2586333 until the food<br />supply is gone, right?
2586417 2587918 That's called<br />territoriality.
2588002 2591255 It's just a theory that<br />I happen to agree with.
2593841 2595425 Then why don't we<br />have one more drink
2595510 2598011 and go down<br />and cut that shark open?
2598513 2601223 Martin?<br />Can you do that?
2605061 2608063 I can do anything.<br />I'm the Chief of Police.

2649856 2650981 (EXCLAIMS)
2651065 2652149 Just like I thought.
2652233 2653233 What?
2654235 2657571 Came up in the Gulf Stream,<br />from southern waters.
2662869 2664161 He didn't eat a car,<br />did he?
2664245 2665370 No.
2665705 2668457 Tiger shark's<br />like a garbage can.<br />It'll eat anything.
2668541 2671501 Somebody probably<br />threw that in the river.
2671794 2673545 (PANTING)
2677800 2679176 That's it.
2681012 2684097 I've got to<br />close the beach,<br />call the Mayor.
2684932 2687309 You got a bigger<br />problem than that,<br />Martin.
2687393 2689936 You still got a hell<br />of a fish out there
2690021 2691813 with a mouth<br />about this big.
2696319 2698487 How do we confirm that<br />by morning?
2699322 2703325 If he is a rogue,<br />and there's any truth<br />to territoriality at all
2703409 2705202 we got a good chance<br />of spotting him
2705286 2706995 between Cape Scott<br />and South Beach.
2707080 2708205 Where are you going?
2708289 2709706 To find him.<br />He's a night feeder.
2709832 2710832 On the water?
2710917 2712417 We're not gonna<br />find him on the land.
2712502 2713877 I'm not drunk enough<br />to go on a boat.
2713961 2715003 Yes, you are.
2715088 2716380 No, I'm not.<br />Yes, you are.
2716464 2717923 I can't do that.<br />Yes, you can.
2722678 2724179 (BOAT ENGINE WHIRRING)
2727100 2730727 I'm telling you,<br />the crime rate in<br />New York will kill you.

2744867 2747077 In 25 years,<br />there's never been
2747161 2748829 a shooting or a murder<br />in this town.
2749705 2752207 No kidding?<br />Want a pretzel?
2752959 2754167 Where are we?
2754252 2757254 We're right in the stretch<br />where he's been feeding.

2761676 2763260 No, it's a closed<br />circuit TV system.
2763344 2765887 I have underwater<br />cameras fore-and-aft.
2766514 2768223 Who pays<br />for all this stuff?
2768307 2769724 The government?<br />The Institute?
2769809 2771852 This stuff costs<br />a lot of money.
2773396 2775772 I paid for this<br />mostly myself, actually.
2775857 2777649 You're kidding.<br />No.
2778317 2779985 You rich?<br />Yeah.
2780778 2782154 How much?
2782238 2783738 Personally,<br />or the whole family?
2785199 2789327 Doesn't make any sense.<br />They pay a guy like you<br />to watch sharks?
2789745 2793206 Well, it doesn't<br />make sense for a guy
2793291 2794833 who hates the water to<br />live on an island either.
2795626 2798712 It's only an island<br />if you look at it<br />from the water.
2798963 2800755 That makes<br />a lot of sense.
2806721 2808472 BRODY: What is<br />that thing doing?
2809849 2811892 Well, it's a fish finder.

3022645 3024729 This is a great white,<br />Larry. A big one.
3024814 3027691 Any shark expert<br />will tell you it's<br />a killer, a man-eater.
3027775 3030527 The situation is<br />that apparently<br />a great white shark
3030611 3032904 has staked a claim<br />in the waters<br />off Amity Island.
3032988 3036199 He'll continue to feed here<br />as long as there's food<br />in the water.
3036283 3037867 There's no limit<br />to what he'll do.
3037952 3039327 We've had<br />three incidents.
3039412 3041830 Two people<br />killed within a week.<br />It'll happen again.
3041914 3043998 It happened before.<br />The Jersey beach, 1916.
3044125 3046042 Five people<br />were killed...<br />In one week.
3046127 3047377 Tell him<br />about the swimmers.
3047461 3050714 A shark is attracted<br />to the exact kind of<br />splashing and activity
3050798 3053633 that occurs<br />whenever human beings swim.<br />You can't avoid it.
3053718 3057387 Opening the beaches on<br />the Fourth of July is like<br />ringing the dinner bell.
3057471 3058847 Look, Mr. Vaughn
3058931 3061641 I pulled a tooth<br />the size of a shot glass
3061726 3063268 out of the wrecked hull<br />of a boat out there.
3063352 3064853 It was the tooth<br />of a great white.
3064937 3066604 It was Gardner's boat,<br />all chewed up.
3066689 3068982 I helped tow it in.<br />You should've seen it!
3069066 3071818 Where is that tooth?<br />Did you see it, Brody?
3072194 3073820 I didn't see it.<br />He dropped it<br />on the way in.
3073904 3075947 I had an accident.
3076115 3079284 And what did<br />you say the name<br />of this shark is?
3080619 3083538 It's a Carcharodon carcharias.<br />It's a great white.
3083748 3085707 You don't<br />have the tooth?
3086959 3089794 Look, we depend on<br />the summer people<br />for our very lives...
3089879 3092964 You won't have a summer<br />unless you deal<br />with this problem!
3093048 3096217 We have to close the beach<br />and hire someone<br />to kill the shark!
3096302 3098094 We have to tell<br />the Coast Guard.
3098179 3101139 You'll have to contact<br />the Shark Research Panel.
3101223 3103516 You'll have to ring<br />this entire harbor!
3103601 3105310 I don't think<br />either one of you
3105394 3107103 are familiar<br />with our problems!
3107188 3109397 I think that<br />I am familiar<br />with the fact
3109482 3111649 that you'll ignore<br />this particular problem
3111734 3114068 until it swims up and<br />bites you in the ass!
3114153 3117155 Wait a second!<br />There are two ways<br />to deal with this problem!
3117239 3120366 You either kill this animal<br />or cut off its food supply.
3120451 3122327 BRODY: We have to<br />close the beaches.
3122411 3123536 Brody?

3126248 3130335 That is<br />a deliberate mutilation<br />of a public service message.
3130628 3133546 I want those little<br />paint-happy bastards<br />caught
3133631 3135340 and hung up by<br />their Buster Browns.
3135424 3138468 That's it.<br />I won't waste my time<br />arguing with a man
3138552 3139761 who's lining up<br />to be a hot lunch.
3139845 3141137 I'm gonna see<br />you later, Brody.
3141222 3143306 Don't do this.<br />He's not...
3149939 3154776 What we are dealing with here<br />is a perfect engine,<br />an eating machine.
3155361 3157070 It's really<br />a miracle of evolution.
3157154 3160990 All this machine does<br />is swim and eat
3161242 3163743 and make little sharks.<br />And that's all.
3163953 3166746 Why don't you take<br />a long, close look<br />at this sign?
3166831 3168998 Those proportions<br />are correct.

4559388 4560513 I got it!
4560681 4562098 (REEL SPINNING LOUDLY)
4562183 4564226 What?<br />Get behind me.
4567647 4569397 Hooper, reverse her!
4570233 4572234 Taking a hell<br />of a lot of line!
4572318 4575779 Chief, get the scoop<br />out of the bucket!<br />Wet the reel!
4579575 4581660 Hooper, reverse her!
4585414 4588750 Duck your head down.<br />We're swinging.<br />Get behind me again.
4589126 4592003 No more water.<br />I don't want you<br />to drown me.
4592630 4596049 Hooper,<br />you idiot, starboard!<br />Ain't you watching it!
4600054 4601513 Hooper, neutral.
4608896 4610689 Where'd he go now?
4611440 4613275 He ain't fooling me.
4614360 4616403 What's he yanking on now?
4617280 4618863 Go on, try it.
4631460 4634546 I don't know, Chief,<br />if he's very smart<br />or very dumb.
4641554 4642721 Jesus...
4646434 4647892 He's gone under.
4648102 4651896 He's gone under the boat.<br />I think he's gone<br />under the boat.
4652690 4654232 Yeah, it's too easy.
4654358 4657610 He is a smart, big fish.<br />He's gone under the boat.
4658112 4661364 Keep her steady, now.<br />I got something very big!
4661574 4662991 I don't think so.
4664160 4666119 Chief, put your gloves on.
4666704 4669289 You put your gloves on,<br />both of you!
4671959 4674002 Getting ready<br />to run out again.
4674754 4676379 Quint, let it go.
4676464 4679174 Maybe you're a big yahoo<br />in the lab,
4679258 4680550 but out here<br />you're just supercargo!
4680634 4683386 If you don't want<br />to backstroke home,<br />you get down here!
4683471 4686389 You don't want<br />to listen to me,<br />don't listen to me.
4686474 4687682 It's not a shark.
4687767 4689809 The wire's showing.
4689894 4691353 Unbuckle me.
4692271 4693855 Get the other side.
4693939 4695482 It's a tuna<br />or swordfish
4696233 4697901 wasting our time.
4698611 4700111 Take this rod.
4700196 4701863 Hooper, give the Chief<br />a hand, will you?
4701947 4702989 Right!
4703074 4704115 Oh, shit!
4714293 4717003 It may be a marlin<br />or a stingray
4717630 4719839 but it's definitely<br />a game fish.
4731602 4732977 Gaming fish?
4733687 4737065 Marlin, stingray bit<br />through this piano wire?
4737149 4738858 Don't you tell me<br />my business again.
4739151 4740151 You get back<br />on the bridge.
4740236 4742779 Quint, that doesn't<br />prove a damn thing.
4742863 4744989 It proves one thing,<br />Mr. Hooper.
4745074 4748243 You wealthy<br />college boys don't have<br />the education enough
4748327 4750078 to admit<br />if you're wrong.

4774395 4775895 Aye-aye, sir!
4778023 4781317 You see, what I do,<br />Chief, is I trick them<br />to the surface.
4781735 4783445 And then<br />I jab at them.
4783737 4787198 I'm not going<br />to haul them up<br />like a lot of catfish.
4787491 4789117 Hooper, full throttle!

5289701 5291744 Thresher?<br />It's a shark.

5348093 5349468 What is it?
5354474 5357643 Mr. Hooper, that's<br />the U.S.S. Indianapolis.
5365193 5367153 You were<br />on the Indianapolis?
5367320 5368612 What happened?
5370615 5374660 Japanese submarine<br />slammed two torpedoes<br />into her side, Chief.
5375996 5379874 I was coming back<br />from the island<br />of Tinian to Leyte
5379958 5383085 just delivered the bomb,<br />the Hiroshima bomb.
5386256 5389008 1, 100 men went<br />into the water.
5389092 5390926 Vessel went down<br />in 12 minutes.
5393305 5396223 Didn't see the first shark<br />for about half an hour.
5396475 5398392 Tiger, 13-footer.
5398477 5401353 You know how you know that<br />when you're in the water,<br />Chief?
5401438 5404690 You tell by looking<br />from the dorsal<br />to the tail.
5406276 5408152 Well, we didn't know.
5408528 5411655 Because our bomb mission<br />had been so secret
5412449 5414825 no distress signal<br />had been sent.
5415911 5417161 (CHUCKLES)
5421500 5424543 They didn't even list us<br />overdue for a week.
5426004 5429507 Very first light,<br />sharks come cruising
5430008 5432927 so we formed ourselves<br />into tight groups.
5433804 5436639 You know, kind of<br />like old squares
5436723 5438307 in a battle like<br />you see on a calendar
5438391 5441185 like the Battle<br />of Waterloo.<br />The idea was...
5441269 5442895 the shark comes<br />to the nearest man
5442979 5445773 and he starts pounding,<br />hollering and screaming.
5445857 5448484 Sometimes the shark<br />would go away...
5449444 5451445 but sometimes<br />he wouldn't go away.
5451530 5455783 Sometimes that shark,<br />he looks right into you,<br />right into your eyes.
5455951 5457159 (SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
5457244 5459870 You know, a thing<br />about a shark, he's got...
5460330 5464333 lifeless eyes.<br />Black eyes,<br />like a doll's eyes.
5465961 5469463 When he comes at you,<br />he doesn't seem to<br />be living
5469798 5474718 until he bites you.<br />Those black eyes roll<br />over white and then...
5476221 5479723 Then you hear<br />that terrible<br />high-pitched screaming.
5480142 5482059 The ocean turns red.
5482477 5486313 In spite of the pounding<br />and the hollering,<br />they all come in.
5488024 5489733 They rip you<br />to pieces.
5489985 5492194 (GRAVE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
5494573 5497575 You know,<br />by the end of<br />that first dawn...
5498743 5500369 we lost 100 men.
5501872 5504415 I don't know<br />how many sharks.<br />Maybe 1,000.
5504541 5507585 I don't know how many men,<br />they averaged six an hour.
5508211 5511172 On Thursday morning,<br />I bumped into a friend<br />of mine...
5511256 5513674 Herbie Robinson,<br />from Cleveland.
5514885 5517511 Baseball player,<br />bosun's mate.
5519598 5523642 I thought he was asleep.<br />Reached over to wake him up.
5525270 5529106 He bobbed up and down<br />in the water just<br />like a kind of top.
5529774 5531066 Upended.
5535113 5537781 He'd been bitten in half,<br />below the waist.
5541620 5545706 Noon the fifth day,<br />a Lockheed Ventura saw us.
5545790 5548918 He swung in low<br />and he saw us.<br />He was a young pilot.
5549002 5550211 Younger than Mr. Hooper.
5550295 5553130 He saw us<br />and he came in low,<br />and three hours later...
5553256 5556717 a big fat PBY comes down<br />and starts to pick us up.
5556801 5559637 That was the time<br />I was most frightened.
5560305 5562139 Waiting for my turn.
5563516 5566268 I'll never put on<br />a life jacket again.
5567979 5570439 So, 1, 100 men went<br />into the water
5571149 5573067 316 men come out.
5573151 5577112 The sharks took the rest,<br />June 29, 1945.
5580075 5583827 Anyway,<br />we delivered the bomb.

5794122 5795706 Pull your left hand down.
5795790 5798834 I can't. It'll only go<br />about three inches.
5799002 5800794 HOOPER: All of our<br />injectors got scored
5800879 5802796 from the salt water<br />in the fuel.
5803673 5806258 QUINT: Yeah,<br />the housing's bent,<br />you can hear it.
5807135 5811597 Try the left rudder again.<br />More left. Good.<br />Once again now.
5812557 5814308 (MENACING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
5814809 5816310 Quint, there it is.
5817270 5818979 What do you say, Chief?
5819189 5821773 The barrel is up,<br />it's right in the stern.
5825778 5829198 I think he's<br />right under the keg.<br />Grab the boat hook.
5840543 5843003 Quint, if we can<br />get close enough...
5844422 5846173 I've got things on board<br />that'll kill it.
5846257 5849134 Just want to<br />goose him up.<br />Come on.
5849677 5852137 (SOMBER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
5860980 5864691 When he runs,<br />you drop that rope<br />or you'll lose your hands.
5866027 5868195 I've seen fingers<br />torn out at the knuckles.
5868279 5870280 Whole sea's bones,<br />full of them.
5870365 5872282 Give it to me a minute.

5890969 5892427 Start the engine.
5894764 5896348 Where are you going?
5896432 5897975 I'm going to<br />make a phone call.
5904399 5906900 Hello, mayday, Orca.<br />Coast Guard?
5908236 5910737 Coast Guard,<br />this is the Orca.<br />Do you read me?

5919414 5920956 Excuse me, Chief.
5921332 5924751 That's great!<br />That's just great!
5924836 5926503 Now, where the hell<br />are we, eh?
5927922 5931675 You're certifiable,<br />Quint, you know that?<br />You're certifiable!
5932010 5933802 You're certifiable,<br />but I'll tell you this!
5933886 5935178 Boys,
5936848 5939516 I think he's come back<br />for his noon feeding.
5941019 5942811 Hook me up<br />another barrel.
5943354 5945355 (TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
5973426 5975260 Bring her around<br />after him.
5978681 5981016 (LIGHT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
5992111 5994571 Full throttle!<br />Get me right up<br />alongside of him!
5994697 5997949 I can't rev it up that high,<br />it's not going to take it!
5998242 6001078 (ADVENTUROUS INSTRUMENTAL<br />MUSIC PLAYING)
6015677 6017260 Five degrees port.
6024143 6026103 All right,<br />hold your course.

6040952 6042202 Fast fish.
6042286 6043453 QUINT: Watch my hand.
6044664 6048208 Be sure you watch<br />my hand! Follow me.
6049460 6052045 Lad, you watch him now!<br />Starboard!
6053297 6055132 Run him down, Hooper.
6062306 6063640 Hard aport.
6067478 6069146 Watch him. Starboard.
6079323 6081366 (TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
6093963 6097299 I can't believe it.<br />Two barrels and<br />he's going down again.
6102930 6104347 It's incredible.
6110396 6112314 They're up again!<br />Now what?
6121574 6123950 Why don't we lead<br />the shark into shore
6124035 6125827 instead of him<br />leading us out to sea?
6130291 6132000 Grab a couple of poles.
6134295 6136421 Hang on now,<br />we're going around.
6137215 6139716 Into starboard. Easy.
6140676 6142719 I'm going to<br />back her off now.
6142804 6144596 Watch those barrels, boys.<br />Watch them.
6149143 6151228 All right, gentlemen,<br />snag them.
6156484 6158860 Now then, tie them<br />to the stern cleats.
6162114 6164741 Brody, bring your end<br />around the cleat.
6165785 6169329 That's right,<br />it'll lock itself off.<br />Give him room, Brody.
6170289 6171331 (GROANING)
6171415 6173124 Stay clear of the line!
6180883 6182592 Watch it. Stand clear.
6192728 6195230 Stand away from<br />those stern cleats!
6208369 6210453 Back home we got<br />a taxidermy man.
6210538 6211997 He's going to<br />have a heart attack
6212081 6214749 when he sees<br />what I brought him.<br />(LAUGHS)
6220631 6223466 Throttle back.<br />You're losing a cleat.
6226178 6228847 My God, this one, too.<br />They're both going.
6229098 6231016 He's eating his way<br />through that line.
6231100 6232976 He's working his way<br />right up to us.
6233102 6235937 Quint!<br />Come on, Quint. Hurry!
6238482 6239774 Out of my way.
6244989 6245989 Watch it.
6250036 6252662 Untie this.<br />He'll pull out<br />the transom.
6256500 6258460 Make it fast! We got<br />another line in him!
6258544 6260503 I can't,<br />it's trying to run!
6261881 6263590 BRODY: We better<br />get another line!
6263674 6265675 QUINT: Pull,<br />you son of a bitch!
6265968 6268178 I hope your back breaks!
6268262 6270138 Go ahead. Pull your<br />bloody heart out.
6270806 6272182 Tie him off!
6277355 6279689 It's impossible!
6280900 6282567 Boys, it's too tight!
6283027 6284819 HOOPER: He's pulling us!
6286739 6288657 We're breaking up<br />over here!
6295247 6297540 We're breaking up!<br />Cut it!
6298376 6299834 BRODY: Watch your hands!
6301212 6303254 HOOPER: Cut it quick.<br />I can't hold it!
6311263 6313056 (HOOPER PANTING)
6324402 6326778 He can't stay down<br />with three barrels<br />on him.
6326904 6329072 Not with three barrels,<br />he can't.
6329240 6330740 What about us?
6331283 6334953 Hooper, get the pump<br />out of the locker<br />in front of you, will you?
6335413 6337163 We're going to sink,<br />aren't we?
6337248 6340208 Keep an eye on the barrels.<br />Pump it out, Chief.
6340584 6342627 (MENACING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
6346716 6348258 HOOPER:<br />Starting to go under.
6348426 6351886 He can't with<br />three barrels on him.<br />Not with three he can't.
6386756 6388923 You ever have<br />one do this before?

6427546 6429422 (MENACING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
6431759 6434260 I'm going to draw him<br />into the shallows.
6434345 6435553 Draw him into<br />the shallow water.
6435638 6438431 I'm going to draw him in<br />and drown him.
6438682 6439891 We're heading in, Brody.
6439975 6441142 Thank Christ!

6626537 6629914 What exactly can you do<br />with these things of yours?
6633752 6637839 I think I can pump 20 cc<br />of strychnine nitrate<br />into him.
6638215 6640425 If I can get<br />close enough.
6642886 6645388 Get this little needle<br />through his skin?
6647182 6648766 No, I can't do that.
6650728 6652645 If I can get him<br />close to the cage,
6652730 6653896 I can get him<br />in the mouth.
6653981 6655523 That shark will rip<br />that cage to pieces.
6655607 6658026 You got any<br />better suggestions?
6660362 6662697 (ADVENTUROUS INSTRUMENTAL<br />MUSIC PLAYING)
