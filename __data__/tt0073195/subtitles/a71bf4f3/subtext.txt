19670 21306 We're off the east coast of America,
21389 23571 on the ferry from Cape Cod<br />to Martha's Vineyard.
23774 25515 Martha's Vineyard is a tiny island
25626 27310 which achieved an international fame
27411 30153 five years ago this summer<br />when senator Edward Kennedy
30264 34041 drove his car off the bridge and<br />into the river at Chappaquiddick.
34418 36830 It's a tiny island, the holiday preserve
36937 39304 of the rich from New York and from Boston.
39489 41435 But this summer it's the location
41542 43476 for one of America's<br />biggest motion pictures,
43544 44636 <i>Jaws.</i>
44745 46622 Based on the novel by Peter Benchley.
46697 48540 It's a best seller in England right now.
48649 50765 <i>It's the story of how a killer shark</i>
50867 53029 <i>marauds and threatens the lives</i>
53136 57016 <i>and the livelihood of a small<br />New England beach community.</i>
57391 61237 <i>Making a feature film on dry<br />land is a complex enough process.</i>
61511 64378 <i>There seem to be at least<br />three people for every job.</i>
64448 67816 <i>Making a feature film at sea<br />stops just short of a nightmare.</i>
68352 71128 <i>It's the second day of<br />American shooting on Jaws.</i>
71238 73229 <i>They've already been to Australia</i>
73357 75348 <i>for the underwater shots of the shark.</i>
76143 78089 Turn on the walkie-talkie please, Freddy.
78245 80191 I don't think Freddy can lift his anchor.
80314 82430 I need to talk to you, Fred.
82532 85581 Turn on the walkie-talkie.<br />Stand up, we're not shooting.
85902 89145 <i>All the usual panoply of<br />assistant directors with megaphones</i>
89256 91520 <i>continuity girls, barks, and chippies</i>
91625 93889 <i>are obliged to float round the action.</i>
94077 95738 <i>They're still in the process of learning</i>
95812 98053 <i>which side is port and which is starboard.</i>
98899 101209 Guys we can't shoot right now, hold on.
106123 110117 Have that boat go out and pull the<br />anchor up and reset it out there, okay?
113497 116228 <i>Film stars, Roy Scheider<br />of The</i> French <i>Connection</i>
116300 118928 <i>and Richard Dreyfuss of American Graffiti.</i>
119236 121147 Director faced the head of the studio
121238 123104 and he said, "I can't do it in time."
123206 125288 <i>But in the age of "director as superstar"</i>
125392 127087 <i>the movie will probably be sold</i>
127194 129185 <i>on the latest American<br />star behind the camera,</i>
129630 131098 <i>Steven Spielberg.</i>
137671 140880 <i>Jaws is one of the hottest<br />properties in the film world this year.</i>
140957 143051 <i>The book was an instant hit in America</i>
143126 145367 <i>and the film rights<br />were commensurately costly.</i>
145796 147036 <i>To shoot for 13 weeks</i>
147130 149064 <i>at a budget of over a million pounds</i>
149216 151162 <i>is something of a rarity these days.</i>
151234 153862 <i>So the producers, Richard<br />Zanuck and David Brown</i>
153970 156166 <i>must have a lot of faith in their property</i>
156239 158583 <i>and even more in their<br />director Mr. Spielberg</i>
158959 161178 <i>who is only 26 years old.</i>
162863 164706 <i>In America he's already provided them</i>
164798 166562 <i>with a financial and critical success in</i>
166667 168715 <i>Sugar land Express, which he directed.</i>
168802 172432 <i>He won the award for best<br />screenplay at the recent Cannes festival.</i>
172556 175298 <i>Age never seems to have<br />daunted Mr. Spielberg.</i>
175409 178674 <i>At 20, he was directing<br />episodes of Columbo in Hollywood.</i>
178779 183023 <i>At 22, he made Duel. A story of<br />a motorist being chased by a lorry.</i>
183100 185899 <i>Which got rave reviews when<br />it was eventually released here.</i>
186002 187879 <i>And now Jaws.</i>
188055 192515 <i>It's lunchtime and the afternoon<br />dialog is being doctored a little.</i>
194478 196424 No, because he'll be so energetic.
196530 197622 He'll be screaming and yelling,
197731 199574 "It's a great white!<br />I knew it all along."
199700 204262 And there's only room in there for<br />one quick, expository line about...
204738 205967 The mate.<br />...the mate.
206073 207689 The mate is dead.<br />Where's the body?
207758 209169 Why is the boat torn to pieces?
209276 210903 Because it's a great white shark.
211011 213389 And then all we have<br />to do is, uh, cut out.
213847 215076 Where are they feeding him?
215132 216293 I don't know.
217868 219666 There have been<br />known attacks...
219770 221568 There's a theory<br />called the bumping theory.
221671 222888 And it's not a theory anymore,
222973 225408 it's a proven fact that sharks will
225726 228775 nudge and bump a, uh, boat
228862 231342 or an intended victim before they attack.
232099 234261 Uh, uh, not so much in a playful manner
234351 237560 but in a way of testing its, uh, defenses.
237671 239901 To see if it's going to bump back
239990 242209 and when it doesn't,<br />it comes in for the kill.
243994 245689 Kosher salami!
245796 248845 <i>Spielberg himself had<br />the idea for</i> Sugar land <i>Express.</i>
248965 250683 <i>He found it in a newspaper.</i>
250784 253310 It had to do with, uh,<br />the loss of their baby
253420 256606 and it had to do with,<br />um, this media event.
258909 261606 Where it sort of<br />sprang up all of a sudden.
261711 263486 In Texas, there's a posse theory.
263613 265388 When a fellow officer is in trouble
265499 268617 everybody jumps into their<br />automobiles, all the fellow officers
268718 272018 they fall in behind to try to help<br />the guy out. The posse theory
272088 274648 <i>sort of is the backdrop</i><br />issue <i>for Sugar land Express.</i>
274724 277591 I was able to, within<br />the budget of my picture,
277661 279459 afford 40 police cars
279546 281765 and in real life 90<br />police cars were involved
281832 283709 in a bumper-to-bumper pursuit.
283817 286878 That was strung out over,<br />uh, about 150 miles.
286987 289081 I had seen Goldie in Butterflies are Free.
289189 292250 And there was one scene she<br />had with Eileen Heckart in the car
292359 296478 that I felt was, uh, really heart turning.
297013 301098 Uh, I knew there was<br />serious actress somewhere
301201 303010 underneath that Laugh-In facade.
303119 306430 She was anxious to break out of<br />that mold and do something dramatic
306540 308952 and do something very serious,<br />and that's why she
309025 312051 became a part of the company<br />and that's why I hired her.
312913 315689 You seem to get very strong performances
315765 319759 and naturalistic performances from<br />your actors. What's your technique?
320821 324724 I don't know if it's so much of<br />a technique. I asked the actor
325959 328758 For the most part to give me too much.
328929 332559 So I can then take it down to<br />a level that I feel is believable.
332666 334885 I don't like casting actors who are
334968 337187 low-key people.<br />I like people with energy.
337254 339734 So in the initial casting,<br />I think that half of
339840 342252 what a director does<br />is cast his picture well.
343326 347661 The other half is, uh, the<br />control of the people within that.
347731 349358 But I think half of the secret
349432 351264 when you do see a good<br />picture and you like the people,
351334 352824 it's in the casting.
352903 356737 Uh, I like people who are<br />outspoken and who are very large
356806 358740 so I can bring them down to life level.
358808 361937 You know in King <i>Kong,</i> when<br />they run into the jungle, all talking?
362012 364947 There's 40 extras and<br />everybody had three things to say.
365015 367074 All through the picture,<br />they're ad-libbing.
367183 370266 "It's big! Do you see it coming<br />there? Look out Charlie! Fire now!
370353 371650 "Throw the grenade! Duck!"
371755 374656 Everybody had three lines to<br />say, they all overlapped. Terrific.
374758 377022 They haven't made a movie<br />like that since King Kong.
377093 379039 A lot of, "What's the<br />matter? "What's wrong with it?
379129 381029 "Looks like it's broken."<br />Right.
381097 382758 "That rear cleat's all torn up."
383300 385860 The scene they're taking<br />is one early in the film.
385936 388883 Where a fisherman has gone<br />out to try and catch the shark
388989 391981 but it's holed his boat and<br />it's sunk and it's killed him.
392092 396245 The two men, the sheriff, Brody,<br />and Hooper, the shark expert
396313 398031 come upon his body.
402035 403309 Roll sound.
403386 406583 <i>It's taken pretty<br />well all day to get this shot.</i>
407207 408390 Marker.
408942 411843 <i>Time and tides still refuse<br />to obey the director.</i>
411945 413276 <i>One of the actors has to climb</i>
413380 415849 <i>from the rescue craft<br />into the half-sunk</i> boat.
415949 418498 <i>An easy enough task, you might think.</i>
419769 420793 Whoa!
423707 426119 Forget it. Don't<br />roll. CREW MEMBER: Save it.
426710 430123 <i>Over half an hour is wasted<br />for dry clothes and new make-up.</i>
430230 432198 <i>By then the light is wrong and the shot</i>
432299 434233 <i>is put off till the following day.</i>
435518 438647 it seemed to me almost<br />fanciful in the book that a shark
438722 441464 could actually threaten<br />people on a large boat.
441558 443720 But nevertheless, this is the case, is it?
443827 446046 Sharks have... Here's<br />an interesting example,
446146 448296 when we were shooting<br />the Australian sequences
448365 449833 of the great white sharks
449899 453460 one of the great white sharks<br />jumped into the cage boat
453536 456301 and sank the cage boat and sank the cages.
456373 458592 The shark grabbed between its jaws,
458692 461571 which can close and squeeze<br />at 21 tons per square inch,
461645 464740 grabbed and twisted a cage<br />and then sounded with the cage.
464814 468091 When we recovered the cage it<br />was torn up, completely torn up.
468184 470118 It's not very big,<br />it'll never hold that boat.
470186 472120 It will hold something.
472222 474168 <i>This is my second day at sea</i>
474441 476910 <i>and I have 54 more days to go</i>
477644 481922 <i>and if I survive this, uh,<br />I will have learned a lot.</i>
482115 484493 <i>Right now, all I can tell you is</i>
484567 488344 <i>it's twice as slow shooting at<br />sea as it is shooting on land.</i>
488455 490605 <i>Because when you set<br />your camera for a shot</i>
490674 492984 <i>invariably the boat which began here</i>
493093 495391 <i>is over here when you're ready to shoot.</i>
495762 499608 <i>Uh, with tide and wind,<br />uh, there are a lot</i>
499683 501515 <i>of factors to take into consideration.</i>
501584 504781 <i>You really can't, uh, uh,<br />hold composition, hold frame.</i>
504854 506344 <i>You have to do a lot of pot-shotting</i>
506423 507948 <i>and shooting loose at open sea.</i>
508058 509901 Pull the anchor up and reset it.
510010 512308 It doesn't come easily.<br />I don't even think about it.
512412 514642 If I thought about<br />multi-million dollar pictures
514748 518594 and all the equipment and all the<br />responsibility I'd probably go bananas.
