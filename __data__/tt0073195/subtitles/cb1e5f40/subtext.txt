2085 4861 When I first hear<br />the word "jaws",
4972 7919 you know, I just think<br />of a period in my life
8091 11868 when I was much younger<br />than I am right now.
14031 16295 And I think, because I was younger,
16366 20883 I was more courageous, or I was<br />more stupid. I'm not sure which.
20988 24253 So, when I think of <i>Jaws</i>,<br />I think about courage and stupidity.
24358 27885 And I think of both of those<br />things existing underwater.
28679 31364 I had been thinking for years<br />about a story about a shark
31465 32512 that attacks people,
32583 34984 and what would happen if it<br />came in and wouldn't go away.
35052 36793 I hadn't done anything with it really.
36904 38429 Then, in 1964,
38539 41156 I read a story about a shark<br />fisherman off Long Island
41225 44809 who caught a 4,550-pound great white shark
44912 46903 off the beaches of Long Island.
47014 51224 I thought, "Wow! What would happen if one of<br />these things came in and wouldn't go away?"
51318 55653 Again, I didn't do anything<br />about it until 1970 or '71,
55756 58487 when a publisher finally said,<br />"That's an interesting story.
58592 61289 "I'll pay you a couple of<br />dollars if you'll put it on paper."
61395 62806 So that's how the idea began.
63814 66977 One of the many accidents that<br />happened with Jaws was the title.
67050 68814 We had no idea of the title.
68885 70501 I had thought for months about titles.
70604 73505 I probably had a hundred.<br />Some of them were pretentious:
73607 76019 <i>The Stillness in the Water.</i>
76093 78994 <i>A Silence in the Deep.<br />Leviathan Rising.</i>
79096 81940 A lot of them were Françoise Sagan titles.
82049 86611 You know, terribly<br />pretentious and very personal.
86987 89638 <i>There were The Jaws of Death<br />and The Jaws of Leviathan.</i>
89723 92852 They all sounded dramatic or<br />melodramatic or weird or pretentious.
92960 95474 We came up to 20 minutes<br />before production.
95545 97639 My editor and I were<br />lunching at a restaurant
97748 99648 called The Dallas Cowboy in New York.
99733 102851 I said to him, "Look."<br />This was Tom Condon.
103737 106900 "We cannot agree on a word that we like,
107007 108418 "let alone a title that we like.
108492 113225 "In fact, the only word that we even<br />think means or says anything is 'jaws.'
113347 115224 "Call the book <i>Jaws</i>".
115299 118132 He said, "What does it<br />mean?" I said, "I don't know.
118201 120920 "But it's short, it fits on a jacket,
121021 123672 "and it may work."
123757 125088 He said, "Okay, we'll<br />call the thing Jaws."
126093 128312 At first, nobody knew what they had here,
128412 130073 including myself.<br />It was a first novel.
130147 132445 It was a first novel about a fish,
132516 135042 and it had no great prospects.
135118 137200 But Tom Condon, the editor at Doubleday,
137304 141104 sensed that there was more here<br />than just a first novel about a fish.
141208 142369 So it was sent out
142476 144990 to the Book-of-the-Month Club<br />and The Literary Guild
145062 147724 and Bantam and other paperback houses.
147798 150574 The first response was
150684 153699 from the Book-of-the-Month Club,
153787 158475 which made it an "A" book, meaning<br />it is selected for a main selection
158542 160977 or it is in the running<br />for a main selection.
161078 163911 Suddenly people began to think,<br />whoops, we may have something more here
163980 166176 than just a first novel,<br />which nobody will read,
166249 169230 and a first novel about a<br />fish, which who cares less.
169986 173115 <i>Then the Reader's Digest<br />selected it as a selection</i>
173190 176922 and the Book-of-the-Month Club<br />made it an "A" book, main selection.
176993 180679 Then Bantam bought it for what<br />was then an enormous sum of money,
180731 182995 $575,000.
185419 187729 Then it went out to the movie auctions.
187821 191951 And, in those days, we're<br />now talking many years ago,
192059 196144 it went to Zanuck and Brown<br />at Universal for $150,000.
196213 198261 Which was, to me, the moon.
198365 201892 I had no money at all.<br />I had, in the bank, $300.
202119 205896 Both Dick Zanuck and I<br />saw or heard about the book
206006 207906 at identical times.
208008 211854 I heard about it from a small<br />card in the fiction department
211928 215705 of <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, edited by my wife,<br />Helen Gurley Brown,
215816 219446 which gave a brief description of the<br />plot of this novel by Peter Benchley,
219553 221794 and then said, "Might make a good movie."
221872 224022 We both read it overnight,
224124 227606 got on the phone with each<br />other the next morning and said,
227677 230544 "We don't know how we can possibly do it."
230614 234983 But we decided we must<br />have this, whatever it takes.
235051 237986 This is the most exciting<br />thing we've ever read,
238054 241638 and we'll figure out later<br />how we can make it.
241742 243904 Had we read it twice, in my opinion,
243994 245644 we never would have made <i>Jaws</i>.
245746 250377 Because anybody with a<br />modicum of production knowledge
250484 253419 would know there was no way to get a man…
253487 256218 Get a shark
256323 259270 to leap on the stern of a<br />small boat and swallow a man.
259342 260639 How were we going to do this?
260710 262644 Were we going to do it in animation?
262712 265909 Who was going to do this?<br />We never thought about it.
265982 267541 We just loved the book.
267617 269244 We thought it would make<br />a very good movie.
269436 274067 The deal was subject to a meeting
274174 275505 with Mr. Benchley.
275609 277941 Who we'd never met before, actually.
278028 281396 And the agency also very much wanted us
281465 285663 to tie a director of theirs,<br />one of their clients,
285735 289763 into this whole package.
289840 293868 So we had agreed to… I'm not<br />going to mention this person's name
293944 296572 because this is not a flattering story.
296646 299991 But we had agreed, in our anxiety,
300100 303411 to secure the rights to the book
303487 305785 to put on this person as a director.
305856 308848 There was a director, and I<br />really don't remember who it was,
308942 313596 who kept saying, "I've always<br />wanted to make a movie about a whale."
315382 317965 At the end of it, Zanuck<br />said, "That's the end of that."
318034 321083 When the director who<br />was going to direct a whale
321188 323634 was vanquished from our sight…
323707 327337 And here was Steven<br />Spielberg. Director, filmmaker…
327410 330607 Sugar/and Express,<br />right within sight of us.
330680 334298 Steven actually… And there<br />are many versions of this.
334401 336927 Steven will tell you his,<br />probably the true one.
337037 341782 I just remember seeing a very<br />large, you know, block of pages
341992 345656 that said Jaws on it, and I<br />didn't know what that meant.
345729 348994 What was Jaws?<br />Was it about a dentist?
349065 351841 Was this, you know, was it…
351952 354364 Because <i>Jaws</i> did not have a…
354437 356929 It was not in the national<br />consciousness at the time.
357007 359374 It was just a word. It was<br />kind of an unusual word.
359442 362935 I remember borrowing a<br />copy to read over the weekend
363013 366313 and discovering I was<br />completely uninformed,
366383 371230 not knowing that it was a<br />book about a great white shark.
371338 374399 A predator off a beach
374491 378359 in a kind of, you know,<br />Cape Cod-esque town.
379279 381179 I had no idea this was about to become
381281 384410 one of the best-selling<br />books in the nation.
384501 387960 I read it, and I said to myself, "Wow,
388038 389972 "this is just like a movie I just made
390040 394841 <i>"about a truck and a hapless driver,</i>
394928 397022 <i>"called Duel."</i>
397213 400706 Of course I'm young and<br />I'm stupid and I'm saying,
400784 402627 "Duel. Gee, that has four words…
402736 405785 "Duel has four letters<br />and Jaws has four letters,
405855 408802 "and they're both about these leviathans
408909 412209 "Preying upon everyman."
412312 416328 I saw such a comparison between Duel,
416399 421280 which I <i>had done previous to<br />Sugar land Express, and Jaws,</i>
421388 425120 I said to myself, "This is kind of the<br />sequel to <i>Duel,</i> only it's on the water."
425225 429640 I got very interested in it because,<br />coincidentally, the producers of Jaws
429713 434025 had just been my producers on<br />my first feature, Sugar/and <i>Express,</i>
434134 436182 Dick Zanuck and David Brown.
436252 438812 I asked them if this was<br />something I could direct next.
439823 443157 The first thing Dick Zanuck<br />and David Brown said to me is,
443259 445068 "We want to get rid of the back stories.
445161 448620 "We want to make this<br />an A-Z adventure story.
448715 451582 "We do not want to have<br />any of that involvement
451685 455303 "with a romance between<br />Hooper and Mrs. Brody.
455372 458490 "We don't want to talk about the<br />Mafia or about anything like that.
458575 461784 "We want to make this a<br />straight-line adventure story."
461895 465058 Peter Benchley did a very<br />good adaptation of his own novel.
465165 468863 Then Peter kind of turned<br />it over to me and said,
468969 471779 "Here it is.<br />Do with it what you want."
471855 474586 At that point, I didn't quite<br />know what to do with it,
474658 477059 'cause it wasn't the movie<br />I wanted to make next.
477127 481371 I quite didn't know the movie I<br />wanted to make from the novel Jaws.
481464 484240 I knew about the third act,<br />and I knew about the first act.
484351 488913 I just didn't know about the second<br />act, which was going to be a 60-page act.
489022 491673 I remember sitting down<br />and writing the script myself.
491758 494557 Doing an entire draft<br />myself, from beginning to end.
494661 496652 Which I haven't shown to very many people.
496763 500461 And I don't even think I have it anymore.
500567 503559 But I remember a few<br />of the scenes did survive
503670 505729 the movie, and wound up in the film.
505839 508570 But it was more of an exercise for me
508675 512725 to become familiar with what<br />I wanted Jaws to become.
512796 515310 It was an exercise<br />that was very beneficial
515415 517383 because I suddenly<br />had a vision of the film
517484 520602 even though I didn't<br />possess the skills to write it.
520754 524657 David Brown and Dick Zanuck both suggested
524758 526704 that I go to Howard Sackler,
526793 528124 <i>who had written The Great White Hope.</i>
528228 532597 We went from Peter Benchley to a<br />writer by the name of Howard Sackler.
532699 537603 Who was a Pulitzer<br />Prize-winning playwright
537721 539746 <i>who wrote The Great White Hope.</i>
539823 543555 He had been working<br />on something else for us.
543626 547608 He also was an expert scuba diver,
547714 550024 and scuba dived all around the world.
550100 553195 Was very familiar, as is<br />Benchley, by the way…
553269 555397 Great diver.
555472 559204 Very familiar with sharks<br />and underwater activity.
559275 563155 Howard Sackler specifically<br />asked not to have credit.
563263 566528 He only had a limited time<br />to give to the film.
566633 569068 Therefore, he said, "I don't want credit."
569169 571479 But he was, I think…
571554 574899 Spielberg would say he was very important
575008 579275 in that terrible phrase<br />of motion picture-making:
579379 581746 He "broke the back of the story."
581848 584328 Sackler broke the back of<br />the movie and got me to say,
584400 586801 "Yes, I'll make this movie<br />next. I'm committing."
586870 589896 Then came something<br />that's not been recorded
589973 591657 in the history of Jaws.
591758 594341 The Screen Actors Guild contract
594410 597755 was about to expire at<br />the end of June of that year.
597864 602244 It could have been 1973,<br />perhaps, whenever the year was.
602318 606733 The studio decreed that<br />no movie would be started
606840 611152 that could not be finished<br />by June 30 of that year,
611244 612894 because they didn't want to be struck.
612962 615795 That is, that photography was completed.
616800 620680 Steven Spielberg, Richard Zanuck<br />and I met at the Bel-Air Hotel.
620787 623563 And Steven said,<br />"I don't have a script yet.
623640 626018 "You're asking me to<br />start this movie in April?"
626126 629278 Whenever it was, I don't<br />know, maybe this was February.
629345 631791 He said, "I don't have a script."
632899 635869 And I said, "Who can we get?"
635969 638404 He said, "There's a man<br />named Carl Gottlieb.
638505 640234 "I'm thinking about him for the movie.“
640356 642768 I was hired first as an actor because,
642876 646176 if I was going to be on<br />the set, I could at least help
646279 650864 in the improvisations and crowd scenes<br />and finding stuff to do in the moment,
650934 654768 which had been my job on stage<br />at the Committee as an improviser.
654838 657239 Steven thought that<br />would be useful to the film
657307 659674 to be able to go with the flow
659742 662086 and find things on the set and improvise.
662195 666257 In fact, some of the best lines in<br />the film are improvised by the actors
666366 668733 based on their characters in the script.
668835 673318 I asked Carl Gottlieb, who was a<br />friend of mine, to come in to do a polish
673389 676438 and to actually help me…
676543 678591 If I wanted to improvise scenes,
678661 682256 Carl would be there to help organize<br />the improvisation and put it on paper.
682332 686018 I said that we have a<br />chance to make a movie
686119 690067 that's going to do for the ocean<br />what the shower scene did to Psycho,
690139 694337 in terms of affecting a generation<br />with, kind of, a fear of the water.
694410 697129 To this day, when people<br />come up to me and learn
697230 701758 that I worked on the screenplay<br />of Jaws, and talk to me about it,
701868 705566 inevitably, the first thing they say is,<br />"That summer I didn't go swimming."
705672 708369 Or "I've been afraid of the<br />water ever since that movie."
708458 710870 Or "I'm always thinking of<br />sharks when I go swimming.
710977 714242 "In Hawaii, I don't go swimming<br />at all." I hear that to this day.
714347 715826 So, surprisingly enough,
715899 719733 that was my first reaction<br />to the script and the story.
719802 722931 It's the thing that appears<br />to have carried through,
723006 726055 and is one of the overwhelming<br />impressions that we made.
726159 728150 It's, you know, become popular culture.
729162 732678 When you do a straight-line<br />adventure film like <i>Jaws,</i>
732749 735912 anything that doesn't contribute<br />to the suspense or the humanity
736002 738130 or the horror, has to go.
738238 742505 I wanted to introduce<br />Quint, not in his boat,
742609 745237 <i>laughing at all the yahoos on shore,</i>
745345 748246 <i>in that one little visual<br />where the Orca goes by</i>
748348 750612 <i>with Quint laughing and chuckling</i>
750717 753402 <i>at the tiger shark that<br />obviously isn't the predator</i>
753469 755961 <i>that's been killing all<br />the people in the vicinity.</i>
756039 758258 I had another thing that<br />I'd written in my script.
758358 760941 As you recall, I wrote<br />an entire script of Jaws
761027 763678 after Benchley and before Sackler.
763746 766727 And this was one of the<br />scenes that I had written.
767100 772004 That Robert Shaw, or Quint, is in a<br />movie theater watching <i>Moby Dick</i>
773122 775272 on the island of Amity<br />at the local movie house.
775375 778208 He's laughing all the way<br />through it. He can't stop laughing.
778311 782544 It's so silly, the mechanical white<br />whale, Ahab with his big harpoon,
782649 785994 stabbing the whale as<br />he's lashed to the belly,
786069 789482 and the whale sounding and<br />coming up again, and he's still…
789589 792217 This mechanical figure is still sticking
792325 794191 the mechanical harpoon in the whale.
794294 796342 I just had Quint laughing hysterically.
796429 800195 Laughing so hard<br />and so sort of maliciously
800300 803759 that people get up and start<br />leaving the theater until he's all alone,
803870 806919 and his laughter can be<br />heard right down the street.
806990 808469 That was in my script.
808558 812472 But in trying to get the rights to Moby<br /><i>Dick,</i> which Gregory Peck controlled,
812562 815930 Greg wasn't opposed
815999 820129 to the use of that scene that way in <i>Jaws</i>.
820203 823764 He just claimed that he wasn't<br />really proud of <i>Moby Dick.</i>
823840 828004 It was not the proudest<br />moment in his body of work,
828094 831860 and just didn't really want<br />us to either make fun of it
831948 834007 or just include it at all in the movie.
834100 836410 So we could never get<br />the rights to use <i>Moby Dick.</i>
836486 837965 It's part of the film making process.
838071 840415 You write stuff you think you want to see.
840490 844074 Then you sit down and analyze<br />it, for all kinds of reasons,
844177 847545 for dramatic reasons,<br />it's hard to fit them in.
847647 851800 Or for production reasons, or<br />sometimes they're redundant.
851868 856078 For example, the guys on the<br />pier, one of them losing his leg.
856189 859033 Well, we have a guy losing<br />his leg elsewhere in the film.
859125 862823 So, it was, you know,<br />one lost leg too many.
862929 865899 It would have given<br />the shark a matched set.
865982 870727 For us, it was not <i>as</i> useful to the<br />plot. It would have been repetitive.
870837 873351 I had this idea that<br />there's a harbormaster,
873423 875050 and he's in his little shack.
875141 877542 There's all these sailboats.<br />It's night.
877627 880369 There's about 20 sailboats<br />with just their masts sticking up.
880480 882471 The harbormaster in my script,
882582 883890 he's watching a movie with Glenn Ford
883966 885741 <i>called Don't Go Near the Water,</i>
885852 887900 which I thought film<br />aficionados would get off on.
887970 890655 They'd say, "Clever. He's<br />watching Don't Go Near the Water."
890757 893692 Meanwhile, in the back you<br />notice, as he's watching this movie,
893793 896319 one mast starts to go like this.
896496 899909 Then the ship next to it,<br />that mast goes like this.
899982 903111 Then the third mast goes<br />like this, and the fourth mast…
903186 906850 Until all of a sudden you see,<br />in sequential order,
906923 911702 something is traveling beneath<br />the keels of all these sailboats,
911811 913506 and all the masts are moving,
913613 915126 getting closer to the harbormaster.
915198 919715 As the harbormaster goes down to<br />clean out his coffeepot in the harbor.
919819 922049 As he gets down there<br />to clean out his coffeepot,
922155 924135 he, of course, is taken by the shark.
924207 926426 That was a scene that<br />was in my original script
926526 929587 that we just basically<br />couldn't afford to shoot.
929679 932523 In its place, I wrote this other scene,
933015 935109 which was also in my original script,
935201 939001 that slid over to this one,<br />which is the pier.
939105 942587 The two fishermen who<br />take the Sunday pot roast
943376 947688 and a huge chain and a large<br />Texas Chainsaw Massacre-style hook,
948181 950616 and toss it into the current<br />and the tide takes it out.
950700 953749 Of course, the shark takes the<br />bait and the pier comes right off.
953853 956447 <i>The guy comes off the pier.</i>
956556 960265 <i>The reason I wanted the scene<br />in the movie was for one shot.</i>
960343 963461 <i>Not seeing the shark was important<br />to me because it was scarier.</i>
963563 967864 <i>In my opinion, seeing the pier<br />going off, stopping and turning,</i>
967984 970863 <i>and the pier itself coming<br />back for the swimmer…</i>
982098 984647 Charlie, take my word<br />for it, don't look back!
984734 986316 Swim, Charlie!
986419 990117 I've heard that Steven wanted to have<br />the old couple from Sugar/and Express,
990223 994854 whose car was stolen,<br />turn up in their car in Amity.
1004070 1005185 What's the story?
1005271 1007968 The missus and I just had<br />our car taken by an ex-con.
1008074 1009553 Claimed he was a workingman.
1009642 1011121 Was it a green Buick?
1011244 1012962 Seafoam green, 1956.
1013029 1015339 Road master, B-O-W-44.<br />Stole!
1015448 1018713 - You Alvin T. Nocker of New Frankfort?<br />- Oh, yes, sir.
1018818 1020195 Now you're talking.<br />Yes, sir.
1020286 1021651 You just stay put.
1024824 1026815 I wanted them to be passing through Amity.
1026926 1029896 Maybe even going to the beach<br />and spreading out a picnic blanket.
1029996 1031873 Even fantasizing and saying…
1031948 1034679 Perhaps Mr. Nocker blows up an inner tube,
1034834 1038145 and we get the idea that maybe<br />he'll go out in the water with his wife.
1038221 1040462 I thought, "This movie's too hard to make.
1040573 1043474 "I've got to stop making<br />it harder on myself."
1043793 1046012 We thought that
1046112 1050276 to legitimize the movie,
1050383 1051794 there should be
1051867 1056384 some real shark footage in the picture.
1056706 1060973 We had anticipated having<br />much more in the picture
1061077 1064274 than actually ended up being in it.
1064347 1068614 So we sent a second unit<br />down to Australia.
1068701 1073389 Ron and Valerie Taylor were<br />engaged in order to shoot
1073456 1076403 <i>real shark footage off of Australia.</i>
1076993 1079894 <i>Which they were well experienced at doing.</i>
1082365 1085676 My recollection is they were<br />involved with Peter Gimbel.
1085785 1088117 I may be wrong about that.<br /><i>Blue</i> Water, <i>White</i> Death.
1088204 1090298 <i>Blue Water, White Death was and</i> is
1090373 1093422 the finest documentary<br />ever made on sharks.
1093526 1096120 It was done by Peter Gimbel
1096212 1099045 with Ron and Valerie Taylor<br />and Stan Waterman.
1099115 1102642 They went with Rodney Fox<br />down south in Australia,
1102735 1104430 and they found the great white shark,
1104537 1107655 and they did a documentary that<br />stands alone 20-some years later
1107740 1110050 as the pinnacle of shark documentaries,
1110126 1111389 no matter what else has been done.
1111494 1113690 The producers asked Peter Gimbel
1113763 1117461 if he would do the camera work on <i>Jaws,</i>
1117566 1121662 and Peter said, "No, I won't do the<br />camera work, but I'll direct for you."
1121754 1125816 We said, "But, Peter, you've only<br />directed sharks in a documentary.
1125925 1128235 "We're going to have actors."
1128311 1130143 He said, "I don't care.<br />I want to direct."
1130246 1133307 So Peter Gimbel never got<br />to be associated with Jaws.
1133416 1135100 We joked about it many times.
1135201 1138796 Peter said, "Sorry, I can't<br />work on the production for you,
1138888 1141801 "but there are a couple in<br />Australia, Ron and Valerie Taylor,
1141891 1144155 "who have experience<br />with the great white shark.
1144260 1146160 "Why don't you contact them?"
1146228 1150256 Sure enough, Universal<br />Pictures contacted Valerie and I.
1150383 1153546 I said, "Yes, I think we can<br />do the underwater shooting
1153653 1156167 "of live sharks in South Australia."
1156238 1159264 So they flew me to America,
1159342 1163472 and I spoke with Steven<br />Spielberg and Joe Alves,
1163546 1165560 and met the production team over there,
1165665 1168134 and explained what I thought we could do
1168234 1170669 with the real, live great white sharks.
1171087 1175285 But I explained that our sharks<br />were only about 14 feet long,
1175358 1178817 whereas Jaws was about 26 feet long.
1178928 1181306 I had this idea of doing a miniature cage
1181414 1184679 and putting a little person into a midget…
1184784 1187560 Into a miniature cage.
1187636 1190082 And taking the little person…
1191273 1194584 That would have effectively<br />scaled the shark up
1194694 1197573 and added another, you know, nine feet
1197646 1199671 to the overall length of the shark.
1199749 1201740 That kind of made sense to me.
1201834 1206385 But I was looking for a little person<br />who was in scale with the cage
1206472 1209373 and was interviewing<br />a number of little people.
1210593 1214120 I remember this tenacious gentleman
1214230 1217427 who came in to see me, bleeding.
1217500 1218968 I said, "Why are you bleeding?"
1219034 1222334 He said, "I was afraid I was going<br />to be late. I really want this job.
1222405 1225921 "I got into a traffic accident in<br />front of the main gate at Universal."
1226025 1228892 I said, "You did?" He said, "I<br />came here to have the meeting."
1228978 1231140 I said, "Did you leave<br />the scene of the accident?
1231247 1232897 "You're not supposed to."
1232982 1234814 We sent him back to the accident
1234884 1237364 to fill out the report with the police.
1237470 1240519 I remember I was thinking,<br />"What a brave man."
1240790 1243839 And, "He really wants this job."
1243893 1245372 And I was…
1245478 1248061 I was young and courageous<br />and stupid, and I hired him.
1248164 1250064 His name was Carl Rizzo.
1250166 1254330 Hollywood sent us this little<br />man, and he couldn't dive.
1254487 1257115 He had spent most<br />of his life riding horses,
1257223 1259749 doubling for children in<br />films like National Velvet.
1259859 1261975 He'd doubled for Elizabeth Taylor.
1263646 1266547 We had to take him out<br />and stuff him into a cage
1266615 1269016 and dangle him into<br />the cold, southern ocean,
1269084 1273248 and have big, huge, monstrous<br />sharks swimming around him.
1273806 1276548 He was very much afraid,<br />and we had a lot of difficulty
1276625 1280186 getting him into the cage, which<br />is probably quite understandable.
1283098 1284862 <i>We did have two dummies,</i>
1284934 1287244 <i>because we were supposed<br />to have somebody in the cage</i>
1287353 1289151 <i>when the shark broke it up.</i>
1315331 1317072 <i>But we had Carl, and he was much better.</i>
1317183 1320130 <i>He looked better in the<br />cage, and moved around a bit.</i>
1328077 1330705 We'd been working for about a week,
1330880 1334760 and we still hadn't got the shots
1334867 1336983 of the shark attacking the cage.
1337052 1340989 They don't normally do that.<br />They'd rather attack a bait.
1342625 1345139 There were three sharks<br />in the area at the time,
1345244 1347292 and two of them were fairly timid,
1347363 1350412 <i>but one of them came in<br />and he was a big, strong shark,</i>
1350516 1352257 <i>and he swam around.</i>
1352334 1355736 We had the small cage, the<br />half-size cage, hanging on a bridle
1355804 1358853 attached to a winch<br />on the deck of the skippy.
1358958 1363270 He swam over it and got<br />his nose caught in the bridle
1363345 1366895 and tried to swim forward<br />and became trapped.
1367600 1369432 When a white shark is trapped,
1369535 1371913 it goes crazy, and<br />that's exactly what he did.
1372004 1374405 Ron was filming underwater,
1374490 1378449 and actually, that's how we<br />got that footage, and they used it.
1378561 1381724 They wanted someone<br />in the cage at the time,
1381830 1383491 but there was nobody in the cage.
1383566 1385864 So they changed the script
1385935 1388814 to suit that sequence<br />because it was so dramatic.
1425874 1429139 <i>It looked like the<br />shark was destroying the cage,</i>
1429778 1431121 and, in fact, it did.
1431230 1432914 It did a lot of damage to the cage.
1432982 1435349 It broke it away from the small boat,
1435417 1438102 <i>and the whole lot came<br />tumbling down past me</i>
1438187 1439928 <i>and crashed down onto the bottom.</i>
1440789 1445067 <i>That was the scariest thing, I<br />think, I've ever seen underwater</i>
1445361 1447238 <i>because the whole lot was crashing.</i>
1447346 1450088 <i>I could see the shark and the cage</i>
1450165 1452213 <i>all crashing around down on the bottom,</i>
1452318 1454309 <i>and I thought we were<br />going to lose the cage.</i>
1454420 1457196 <i>Of course, it had been<br />broken away from the boat.</i>
1469535 1472049 <i>The shark got out and swam away,</i>
1472121 1475580 but there were two other<br />sharks still in the area.
1475658 1479686 And there was no way that<br />I could swim out of my cage
1479762 1480854 and attach a rope.
1480929 1485173 So what we did, we lowered<br />my cage down onto the bottom,
1485284 1488493 and I put my feet through<br />the bottom of my cage,
1488570 1492723 and picked my cage up, almost<br />like a lady pulls her skirt up,
1492825 1497387 and walked the cage and myself<br />over the bottom about 50 feet
1497763 1501290 to the other broken cage,<br />which was lying on the bottom,
1501400 1503141 tied it to my cage,
1503218 1507132 and then I signaled for them to<br />pull us both back to the surface.
1517316 1518829 Then why don't we have one more drink
1518901 1521165 and go down and cut that shark open?
1522121 1524863 Martin?<br />Can you do that?
1528060 1531246 I can do anything.<br />I'm the Chief of Police.
1532247 1536081 Roy Scheider was interesting,<br />the story of how I cast him.
1536168 1539445 Because here's a situation where<br />I was going after other actors.
1539521 1543287 I went after a whole series of actors<br />before him, a lot of them unknowns.
1543358 1547022 People that no one had<br />ever heard of before,
1547096 1549076 but I was familiar with,<br />from seeing Serpico.
1549181 1551980 There was an actor in Serpico<br />I kind of liked,
1552084 1555395 and another actor on an<br />off-Broadway play I had just seen.
1555471 1559567 But the studio and Zanuck and Brown<br />were urging me to get a name in this part.
1559641 1562884 I was having trouble<br />finding a name that I liked,
1562995 1564463 and who would do it.
1564546 1566731 I remember I was at a party one night…
1566832 1571315 And my agent brought me over<br />to be introduced to him.
1571386 1575072 He was having a conversation with<br />a writer named Tracy Keenan Wynn.
1575657 1577489 As I approached,
1577559 1579744 I heard a conversation that<br />went something like this…
1579845 1584339 "We're going to have to have this<br />giant shark come out of the water
1584450 1588216 "and land on a boat<br />and crack the boat in half."
1588854 1593064 And then I was introduced<br />to him and he said hello.
1593142 1594655 He was very polite, nice, pleasant.
1594760 1598754 Then, as I was walking away, they<br />picked up this conversation again.
1598864 1601242 I remember saying to my<br />agent as we walked away,
1601316 1604616 "Those guys, they gotta be kidding.
1604686 1608736 "A giant shark that cracks a boat<br />in half?" I thought they were loony.
1608841 1610718 I told him the entire story.
1610793 1612522 At the end of the story he said,
1612594 1616576 "Wow, that's a great story.<br />What about me?"
1617216 1621119 I looked at Roy and I said, "Yeah,<br />you know, you'd be a great Chief Brody."
1621220 1623530 <i>'Cause</i> I <i>had</i> loved <i>Roy from<br />The French Connection,</i>
1623605 1626734 where he played Gene Hackman's partner.
1626809 1629050 And that's how that came about.
1629695 1632278 Could you tell me how I<br />could find Chief Brody?
1632347 1633542 Who are you?
1633615 1635856 Matt Hooper. I'm from<br />the Oceanographic Institute.
1635968 1638482 Richard Dreyfuss wasn't<br />my first choice either.
1638554 1641216 I went to Jon Voight first,<br />and he said no.
1641290 1643850 I think I'd interviewed Timothy Bottoms.
1643926 1645701 I interviewed a number of actors.
1645811 1647711 Perhaps Jeff Bridges.
1647813 1650180 I was a big fan of the entire<br />cast from <i>Last Picture</i> Show.
1650632 1654296 I remember saying if I could<br />just get every member of the cast
1654369 1657236 to say no to me to play<br />the Hooper character,
1657306 1660685 at least I will have gone to one<br />of my favorite movies of all time,
1660776 1663211 to have gone out after that group.
1663295 1665354 So I think Bridges and Bottoms,
1665464 1666898 and I think we got turned down,
1666999 1668899 or there were unavailability problems.
1669001 1670617 In the movies these things happen.
1670686 1672427 People want to do it and they can't
1672538 1675052 because they're booked<br />into something else.
1676792 1678658 I remember Dreyfuss…
1680128 1683371 I cast Dreyfuss because<br />I loved American Graffiti,
1683482 1684699 and I had seen him in that.
1684766 1687918 And George Lucas was<br />the person who said to me,
1688020 1691229 "Why don't you cast Ricky<br />Dreyfuss? He'd be great."
1691673 1694290 He told me this movie<br />that he wanted to make,
1694393 1696919 and it was really a shocker.
1697029 1699555 Even as he was telling it to me as a tale,
1699665 1703465 it was a great, exciting story.
1703569 1707972 These three guys alone on the boat,<br />and the shark attacking the boat and…
1710058 1712937 At the end he said, "You<br />want to make this film?"
1713045 1714888 And I said, “No."
1714980 1717745 And he said, "Why not?"
1717833 1722361 And I said, "This sounds like<br />it's going to be a great movie.
1722521 1724785 "I'd rather watch this movie than shoot it
1724890 1727882 "because it's going to be<br />a bitch to shoot."
1728527 1732521 And I said… And he was surprised.
1732631 1737592 I said, "I just wouldn't do well under<br />these circumstances," so I said no.
1739271 1743606 Then a few months later, I went to see<br />the opening of a film I'd done in Canada.
1745177 1748613 <i>It was the premiere of a film</i> called<br /><i>The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.</i>
1748714 1752298 And I saw myself,<br />really for the first time
1753018 1757546 in the lead in a movie,<br />with my face 15 feet high,
1758190 1761990 on screen for 90 minutes,<br />and I had a heart attack.
1762094 1765746 I had a total nervous<br />collapse. I thought I was awful.
1766365 1769949 I figured that I'd better<br />get a job really soon.
1770585 1772053 So I called Steven.
1772788 1776270 I said, "If you still want to<br />offer me that job, I'll take it."
1776842 1778469 And he said yes.
1779111 1781102 So, in essence,
1781747 1785058 I came crawling to Martha's<br />Vineyard for the part.
1787135 1789376 I don't want no volunteers.<br />I don't want no mates.
1789488 1792219 There's too many captains on this island.
1792958 1795393 $10,000 for me, by myself.
1796128 1800907 For that you get the head,<br />the tail, the whole damn thing.
1801616 1804176 My first choice to play Quint<br />was Lee Marvin.
1804987 1808355 I wanted to go for<br />Lee Marvin to play Quint,
1808440 1810772 but Lee Marvin wasn't interested.
1812611 1816343 I think what I heard was, he<br />wanted to go fishing for real.
1817049 1820462 He took his fishing seriously,<br />and didn't want to go fishing
1820535 1823880 from a movie boat with cameras.
1823989 1825787 That wasn't his idea of a vacation.
1825891 1829452 It turned out not to be anybody's<br />idea of a vacation, making Jaws.
1829795 1832526 My second choice was Sterling Hayden,
1833165 1837375 who I thought would make an amazing Quint.
1838820 1841585 He had an Ahab quality about him,
1841656 1845502 and he had actually clone a movie<br />years ago, where he played a whaler
1845594 1847642 with a harpoon that he<br />carried around with him.
1847746 1849441 A very imposing character.
1849548 1850879 I was a big fan of his,
1850966 1852980 <i>certainly from Dr. Strange love</i>
1853085 1855861 and, you know, the<br />two Kubrick films he did.
1857239 1859515 And, as it turned out,<br />he couldn't do it either.
1859608 1862726 I forgot actually what the<br />reason was he couldn't do it.
1863562 1867362 And there were other actors<br />who wanted to play Quint,
1867466 1871300 and then Dick Zanuck and David<br />Brown suggested Robert Shaw.
1871403 1875636 It was their idea, because they had just<br />worked with Robert Shaw in The Sting,
1875741 1878210 which they produced, and loved him.
1878894 1883843 I'd screened two movies I'd already<br />seen of Shaw's, just to refresh my memory.
1885851 1888320 <i>One oi them, of course,<br />was A Man for All Seasons.</i>
1888420 1890582 He was spectacular in that.
1891239 1895005 Based on that and, of course,<br />From <i>Russia with</i> Love…
1895761 1897490 That great fight scene
1897596 1901499 where he played the<br />nemesis of 007 in the train.
1902501 1905482 I said, "Wow, I wish I had<br />thought of it. It's a great idea.“
1905554 1908080 So he, fortunately, said yes.
1908173 1912189 Robert was one of the most<br />powerful people I've ever met.
1914563 1916406 Incredibly intense.
1916515 1919928 I mean, it was something<br />that radiated out of him.
1921086 1924545 He was a remarkably<br />gifted actor and writer.
1925190 1927625 He was also, unfortunately,
1927742 1930791 the most extraordinarily<br />competitive person.
1931213 1932942 Unnecessarily competitive.
1933682 1936515 <i>I think that probably, if anything,</i>
1936585 1938804 <i>that was his flaw.</i>
1939321 1941267 You got city hands,<br />Mr. Hooper.
1941373 1942636 You been counting money all your life.
1942741 1944709 All right, all right.<br />Hey, I don't need this.
1944810 1947609 I don't need this working-class-hero crap.
1947696 1951178 You're not going to do this<br />aboard the ship are you, Mr. Quint?
1951867 1956555 Michael, did you hear your<br />father? Out of the water now!
1956605 1957605 Now!
1957823 1961726 The first person I cast for the<br />movie, in fact, was Lorraine,
1961827 1964558 who I'd loved in a TV<br />movie I'd seen her do
1964663 1966461 <i>called The Marcus-Nelson Murders,</i>
1966565 1968249 starring Telly Savalas and herself,
1968316 1969977 I believe, as Telly's in that.
1970051 1972395 I thought she was a very natural actress,
1972504 1974984 almost improvisational in her style.
1975056 1976615 She brought a realism to the movie,
1976691 1979103 and to that family, which I had wanted.
1979211 1981942 Ellen is very clear to me<br />and always has been.
1982047 1984732 You say Roy Scheider in his character
1984799 1986733 feels guilt because of the children.
1987152 1989211 I'm a mother, I'm a wife, and I'm Jewish.
1989321 1992951 What could be clearer to me than<br />how to make somebody feel guilty?
1993058 1996323 This is something that I do in<br />my sleep. It's what I've trained for.
1996428 1998863 And I have two sons,<br />just like Ellen Brody.
1998964 2002264 The suggestion that I made<br />to Steven at the time was
2003635 2006548 to try to develop the script,
2006638 2010654 so it had the same kind of<br />linear simplicity that Duel had.
2011243 2015271 I thought that was<br />a reasonably good prototype
2015347 2017975 to follow.
2018767 2021782 And I remember some time later,
2021887 2026302 my wife was upset with me…
2026374 2027967 I put upset in quotes.
2028043 2031525 Because a lot of the stuff that<br />we took out had to do with affairs
2031630 2033314 that this particular character,
2033415 2035110 as I recalled, had in the book.
2035217 2037515 Of course I was upset about it,
2037586 2039930 but I was very happy to be cast.
2040488 2043901 Martin, it's all psychological.
2044009 2048003 You yell, "Barracuda!" and<br />everybody says, "Huh? What?"
2049648 2052162 You yell, "Shark!"…
2052234 2055431 we've got a panic on our<br />hands on the Fourth of July.
2055554 2058000 Murray Hamilton I've been a fan of,
2058073 2060485 from The <i>FBI</i> Story with James Stewart
2060926 2064556 to The Graduate and that great<br />scene, you know, with Dustin Hoffman,
2064663 2067712 where he tells Dustin to go<br />off and sow some wild oats.
2067933 2069617 I just always wanted to work with him.
2069701 2073729 I was a big fan of his, and saw<br />him instantly as the mayor of Amity.
2073822 2076871 So, I didn't have to<br />go through nine actors.
2076975 2079034 He was the first choice for that part,
2079144 2080657 and I was lucky enough to get him.
2080729 2082561 I have to talk<br />to Mrs. Kintner.
2082631 2084213 Because this is turning into a contest.
2084316 2087399 It's not just the Gazette. She's<br />advertising in out-of-town papers.
2087469 2090200 People all over New England<br />are going to know about it.
2090272 2092570 <i>The most painful<br />thing I've ever done as a writer</i>
2092641 2096202 is to take my part <i>as</i> an actor<br />and make it smaller and smaller,
2096328 2098126 until it was almost gone.
2098213 2099863 Even though I had good billing,
2099965 2103811 I didn't follow through on screen
2103918 2106797 with the amount of screen time<br />I would have liked as an actor.
2106905 2111365 But it was better for the script that<br />my character not be there so much.
2111977 2115777 Amity Island has long been<br />known for its clean air, clear water
2115864 2117980 and beautiful white-sand beaches.
2118083 2119983 But in recent days
2120085 2121712 a cloud has appeared on the horizon
2121820 2123504 of this beautiful resort community.
2123571 2126188 A cloud in the shape of a killer shark.
2126291 2130137 One of David Brown's geniuses was<br />to realize he could play upon the egos
2130211 2132043 of writers, actors and other people
2132147 2133797 who are not in the movie business
2133882 2137091 by convincing us that only<br />by our appearing in the film
2137202 2139534 could the film achieve its true greatness.
2139638 2142630 So he came to me and said<br />would I consider, possibly
2142741 2145790 as a favor to him, being in this movie?
2145860 2149888 Well, to a person who's done television<br />for four years to be in a feature film?
2150015 2153633 This was not exactly a request
2153702 2155477 that I found it difficult to accept.
2155587 2157487 So I said, "Sure!"<br />This was pure ego.
2157589 2158704 Why not be in a feature film?
2158790 2161168 It was no stretch for me.<br />It was no risk for him
2161242 2164177 because I was a television<br />interviewer professionally, anyway.
2164245 2166395 So I could do very little wrong.
2167082 2170200 He wasn't asking me<br />to play an emotional scene.
2170285 2174028 I was doing what I did for a<br />living, so it worked out very well.
2174873 2178184 If there was a secondary<br />purpose to his request,
2178293 2180944 and David is so wonderfully<br />gracious that you never know
2181046 2184630 whether he's just being nice to<br />you or there's something underneath,
2184733 2188146 it would have been that because<br />of the publicity surrounding the book
2188253 2192417 and surrounding the movie,<br />it couldn't hurt to have me
2193108 2195736 in the movie, in some category or other.
2195844 2198962 In Amity Island, this is Alan Cray.
2199064 2200941 I want to try that end again.
2201316 2202363 Okay?
2203802 2207215 And there you have it. Two different<br />opinions by two men of goodwill.
2207288 2211168 But here in Amity, it seems it's<br />the public that's making up its mind.
2211276 2214018 On Amity Island, this is Alan Cray.
2215196 2216664 All right, Murray, that'll do it.
2216765 2218073 Cut!
2218133 2219225 Save if!
2219968 2223871 When it came down to<br />where we would shoot this film,
2223938 2228603 we sent Joe Alves, our<br />production designer, out with a team
2229043 2233412 to give us some ideas and<br />some photographs and pictures of
2234249 2237150 where this town
2238870 2242716 should be shot, including Jamaica.
2242791 2246352 We thought of Jamaica primarily<br />because of the clarity of the water.
2246428 2251013 We could do underwater<br />work down there, do it all there.
2251116 2255804 And one of the places, obviously,<br />that they went, among others,
2255954 2258150 was the island of Martha's Vineyard.
2258423 2261575 Which, believe it or not,<br />had never been photographed
2261643 2263270 by a feature film before.
2263344 2268123 They had very strict rules<br />and regulations there,
2268716 2271959 and had always kept movie companies in.
2272070 2276337 So it really was a question<br />of talking them into letting,
2276624 2278649 at the height of their season,
2278726 2280820 letting a big movie company come in there.
2280929 2285810 Martha's Vineyard did present<br />the problem that this pristine place,
2286151 2289735 unchanged since the 18th century,
2290355 2293666 didn't particularly care<br />for a movie invasion.
2293741 2296836 They didn't like to see<br />an artificial shark
2297045 2300845 parked in a channel<br />where their homes faced it.
2300949 2304852 And the only set that we built,
2304936 2307416 <i>which was Quint's shack,</i>
2307489 2310618 <i>we had to post a bond<br />with the town authorities</i>
2310692 2314344 <i>that everything would be<br />replaced exactly the way it was.</i>
2314429 2316329 The billboard in the picture…
2316397 2320015 They put up a billboard<br />and some kids have come along
2320118 2324646 <i>and made a prank out of it, painted it<br />with the shark and "Help" and so forth.</i>
2324756 2329273 We had to put up that billboard<br />one morning, shoot the scene,
2329344 2332507 and take it down at the end of the day.
2333598 2335908 That was the only way we could shoot that.
2335984 2338453 There could be nothing done…
2338520 2341512 We could do nothing to alter the landscape
2341606 2345554 or the beautiful harmony<br />that existed on the island.
2345627 2347721 The real attraction of Martha's Vineyard,
2347795 2349524 you couldn't see with the naked eye.
2349614 2352481 It was the only place on the East Coast
2352584 2354461 where I could go 12 miles out to sea
2354802 2359740 and still have a sandy bottom only<br />30 feet below the surface of the water,
2359807 2361571 where we could put the shark sled
2361643 2364544 and the mechanical shark could function.
2364812 2369227 So Martha's Vineyard was chosen<br />less because it was a picturesque village.
2369334 2371428 I could've shot this movie in Sag Harbor
2371536 2373846 or Montauk or a number of places.
2373922 2377859 It was because of that sandy<br />bottom 12 miles offshore.
2377926 2381294 It was very important that no matter<br />what direction my cameras turned,
2381362 2382921 I didn't want to see land.
2383014 2384197 I felt…
2384299 2387701 My fear was, the minute the<br />audience saw land, they'd say,
2387769 2389601 "This is getting pretty intense out here.
2389671 2393050 "Just turn the boat around and go<br />toward that land that we keep seeing."
2393141 2395132 I wanted the audience<br />to feel very cut off,
2395209 2397109 like they couldn't run back to shore,
2397211 2398940 'cause there was no shore to run back to.
2399197 2401882 I was tipped off by somebody on the crew…
2401950 2404726 We were still here at the Universal lot.
2404836 2406418 That Steven was going to come in,
2406487 2410355 and he was really thinking<br />about withdrawing
2410425 2413326 'cause he was very concerned<br />about the way things were going.
2413394 2416853 The shark wasn't working.<br />It seemed hopeless.
2416965 2420014 The script was far from perfect.
2421235 2423545 And a few weeks before, he had
2423655 2425805 had some T-shirts made up
2425873 2429867 with a big shark on it saying "JAWS."
2429978 2432697 And so
2432780 2436592 knowing what he was<br />coming in to talk to me about,
2437719 2439130 I put on a T-shirt.
2439237 2444084 I put on this T-shirt and was sitting<br />behind my desk when he came in.
2444158 2446502 And just seeing me there, I think,
2446611 2448887 in front of the desk with this T-shirt…
2448997 2450715 And I was saying, "This is the greatest.
2450798 2452880 "We're going to kill them with this.
2452984 2455203 "It's great, and you're<br />going to be great for it."
2455269 2459570 It kind of lifted him back into it.
2459691 2463002 Steven is the most<br />enthusiastic man I've ever met,
2463094 2465358 and it brought back that enthusiasm.
2466998 2468272 What's your name again?
2468366 2469583 Chrissie.
2470268 2471360 Where are we going?
2471436 2472436 Swimming!
2472537 2475416 <i>I started doing<br />stunt work, and I specialized in water.</i>
2475490 2478141 <i>A lot of times when the<br />water stunts would come up,</i>
2478226 2480558 <i>I got into doing the water stunts also.</i>
2481129 2484190 <i>Steven Spielberg was a<br />little bit leery having me</i>
2484298 2486812 <i>because I wasn't an actress per se.</i>
2488136 2489604 After the first day of shooting…
2489671 2492971 We did the beach scene the<br />first day, the party scene at night.
2493041 2495339 We got along wonderful after that.
2495410 2497469 Whatever I did, he liked.
2497578 2499569 It was great. He was a<br />great person to work for.
2507205 2508616 Come on in the water!
2508840 2512219 I thought that what could really<br />be scary was not seeing the shark
2512326 2515569 and just seeing the water, because<br />we all are familiar with the water.
2515680 2517580 Very few of us have been<br />in the water with a shark,
2517682 2519480 but we've all gone swimming.
2519584 2522178 The idea of this girl going swimming,
2522270 2524261 and the audience going swimming with her
2524338 2527490 would have been too<br />extraordinary if, like a leviathan,
2527592 2529219 the shark had come out of the water
2529327 2531853 with its jaws agape, and come down on her.
2531963 2534694 It would have been a<br />spectacular opening for the film,
2534799 2537928 but there would have been<br />nothing primal about it.
2538036 2541199 It would just have been a<br />monster moment that we've all seen.
2541289 2544873 I really wanted to do it without<br />seeing the shark in that case.
2544976 2548071 I wanted the violent,<br />jerking motions to just
2548179 2551023 <i>start to trigger our<br />imaginations into either</i>
2551099 2554581 <i>thinking about what's happening<br />below the surface of the waterline</i>
2554669 2557445 <i>or blocking what was<br />happening below the surface.</i>
2561576 2564352 The first jerk down Steven did.
2564912 2568109 He had a cable that came<br />to the front of my stomach
2568199 2571692 and went to an anchor that was<br />laying on the bottom of the ocean.
2571803 2574636 Then he just sat, and<br />when he wanted that pulled,
2574739 2575900 he just would pull.
2576074 2577633 I could feel him pulling down,
2577742 2579904 and I'd just throw my head back even more.
2582296 2585482 They wanted to put me<br />on an electric winch,
2585566 2589013 and I prefer not to use an electric winch
2589454 2593448 because if any of the line<br />overrode and came to a stop,
2593558 2596391 I might not know it and I<br />might not be able to get out of it.
2596494 2600021 Being they're pulling me back and<br />forth in the water, I wanted more control.
2600131 2601872 <i>So we used manpower.</i>
2601949 2605442 <i>They put cutoff Levis on and<br />had cables running from me,</i>
2605520 2607887 out to the side to two pilings,
2607955 2610003 and then all the way in to the beach.
2610108 2613408 What they would do is, we put<br />marks on the beach and the guys,
2613511 2615570 we'd have five or six guys on each line,
2615680 2618672 and they would run back<br />and forth from mark to mark.
2618783 2620376 So I didn't have the hard work to do.
2620485 2622647 I just sat there and got pulled around.
2622737 2625206 The guys were running<br />back and forth on the beach.
2625273 2629710 And that's what made my body<br />move back and forth in the frame.
2629894 2633057 When I would feel my hips<br />getting pulled the opposite way,
2633164 2637010 I'd just throw my arms out of<br />water very violently the opposite way.
2637168 2640433 So, physically, I could make it<br />look more violent than what it was.
2642356 2644165 It hurts!
2646727 2651540 I went to a marine store<br />and bought a safety hook
2651632 2655318 that you'd use on a sail,<br />on the halyard of a sail.
2655403 2658202 I put it onto all the cables<br />that they hooked to me.
2658289 2660053 So that, any time during this scene,
2660158 2661887 if I got in trouble, if I got water,
2661993 2664041 if I got hurt, God knows what happen,
2664111 2666261 I could pull one of those strings,
2666364 2669095 and I was free and clear<br />and could come to the surface.
2669200 2673012 So it allowed me, if I got<br />in a spot, to free myself.
2673120 2676317 How would anybody know if I<br />was hurt or I needed anything?
2676390 2678324 I'm out there screaming like a fool.
2680745 2682110 Oh, my God!
2682213 2685205 In the scene where I<br />was pulled into the buoy,
2685483 2687815 Steven said, "Let's<br />have you say something.
2687919 2690081 "We'll have you say The Lord's Prayer.
2690188 2693715 "Don't the Catholics say<br />something if they're going to die?
2693808 2696869 "They say something they're<br />going to say in the confessional,
2696961 2699931 "asking God to forgive you<br />for all your sins."
2700231 2703667 Unfortunately, I hadn't been going<br />to church for the last few years,
2703768 2705247 and I could not remember it.
2705336 2707498 I swear there were eight Catholics on set,
2707605 2710199 and between the eight of us<br />we couldn't come up with it.
2710308 2711685 I felt very bad.
2717832 2719982 Oh, God, help!
2720434 2722698 Please help me!
2723221 2725030 We looped the film.
2725106 2727837 A lot of stuff we couldn't do<br />because of the noise made.
2727909 2730423 So you go into a looping studio.
2730895 2733796 The idea was, how are you going<br />to sound like you're in the water
2733898 2735332 sitting in a studio?
2735433 2738277 So we came up with the<br />idea of getting a baby bassinet
2738369 2739586 and filling it with water.
2739654 2741213 So I'm sitting on the sound stage,
2741289 2743053 with the film up on the screen,
2743124 2745343 on a stool with my little bassinet,
2745443 2747275 and Richard Dreyfuss came in.
2747461 2750806 I came to visit Steven or I<br />came to do my own looping.
2750915 2753816 I'm not really sure now.<br />It was so long ago.
2755136 2759619 I walked in and Steven had<br />this beautiful girl's blond head
2759740 2761230 reared back like this,
2761309 2764256 and he was pouring water<br />down her throat like this.
2764996 2768114 And telling her to scream<br />her bloody lungs out.
2769100 2773003 Which I thought was a rather<br />interesting way to spend the afternoon,
2773104 2775801 but not particularly comfortable for her.
2775890 2778109 But it does work for the movie.
2778209 2781577 The reason they were doing it<br />was to make the appropriate sound.
2781679 2783477 They couldn't do it any other way,
2783581 2786016 so he just poured that<br />water down her throat.
2790972 2792269 Oh, Jesus.
2792340 2794650 The problem was,<br />they brought the hand to me
2794759 2797854 and they said, "Here's<br />the dead girl's hand."
2797962 2801592 I said, "Wow, it looks like<br />shiny plastic. It looks fake."
2802133 2805228 They said, "After a<br />body's been decomposing
2805336 2808647 "for a day on the sand,<br />with the sun coming down,
2808723 2810191 "it takes on that look."
2810257 2812771 I said, "You might be clinically right,
2812877 2815676 "and a pathologist might look at that
2815780 2817942 "and admire that moment in Jaws,
2818049 2820950 "but to me, <i>as</i> an audience<br />member, it looks fake.
2821052 2822463 "It looks like plastic."
2822636 2826948 We tried putting powder on it<br />to get the reflective shine off.
2827058 2830210 We couldn't do that.<br />So I said, "Well, screw it."
2830695 2834142 I believe I turned to someone<br />and said, "Let me use your arm."
2834215 2836058 Kind of like we do when we're kids,
2836167 2837942 we bury our parents in the sand.
2838019 2839635 I kind of buried her in the sand,
2839737 2841535 and just had her hand sticking out.
2841639 2844483 We made up part of the arm,<br />so right up here,
2844558 2848176 it looked like it had been<br />bitten off, kind of a subtle way.
2848279 2849974 Then there were these sand crabs that
2850081 2852072 we collected and put all over the arm.
2852183 2854447 They were kind of lethargic<br />in their movements.
2854552 2856350 To this day, when I see <i>Jaws,</i>
2856454 2858604 I always have this different vision
2858672 2862119 of 10 times as many crabs<br />moving 10 times as fast,
2862510 2864524 trying to feed on the arm.
2864612 2867627 Later I was able to do that<br />in Temple <i>Of</i> Doom,
2867732 2871293 when I was able to get the bugs<br />to do what the crabs couldn't do
2871402 2873496 15 years earlier.
2880211 2884773 The death of the Kintner boy, and<br />all the paranoia, tension and suspense
2885166 2888466 leading up to the actual<br />attack when he's out on the raft,
2888536 2891233 I, in my mind, wanted to do in one shot.
2892339 2895491 In trying to figure out,<br />in a perfect world,
2895593 2898961 how could I have done that<br />in one sustained shot,
2899063 2900861 I came up with the idea
2900965 2903866 to have bathers with<br />different-colored bathing suits
2903984 2906214 walking in front of the camera
2906287 2908506 <i>that would wipe off Roy Scheider.</i>
2908773 2910571 <i>The same color in the reverse,</i>
2910658 2912342 <i>moving in the other direction,</i>
2912443 2914605 <i>would wipe on what he's looking at.</i>
2914712 2916612 <i>Which, even though<br />it wouldn't be one shot,</i>
2916714 2919513 <i>would give more of a seamless feeling</i>
2920301 2923043 <i>and much more of a clear point of view</i>
2923154 2925236 <i>that you knew who was looking at who.</i>
2925306 2928685 All this must be from the<br />police chief's point of view.
2928793 2930955 The scene's about him.<br />It's about his reaction.
2931045 2932956 It's not about the<br />Kintner boy being killed.
2933047 2935960 It's about the chief of<br />police, his fear of the water,
2936050 2938735 his chief responsibility<br />to protect the public,
2938836 2940895 his fear that there is a shark out there,
2941005 2942439 and he knows it's out there,
2942540 2945384 <i>and these people<br />are going swimming anyway.</i>
2948012 2950060 Did you see that?
2964128 2965175 Hello.
2965246 2967658 Hello back, young fellow.<br />How are you?
2967932 2970299 Craig Kings bury was a local<br />on Martha's Vineyard,
2970401 2972028 and he was quite a character.
2972136 2974400 He himself was a movie and a book.
2976090 2979469 Had I not gotten Robert Shaw
2979577 2981944 and had I met him in an open casting call,
2982046 2986563 I might have come close to flirting<br />with the idea of using him to play Quint.
2986634 2990616 Because he was the purest version
2991322 2993905 of who, in my mind, Quint really was.
2994275 2996573 When I met him, he came<br />up with this great dialogue.
2996644 2998760 I kept increasing his part.
2998863 3001639 Just by meeting him I said,<br />"I want you to be in my movie,
3001749 3003490 "and you can make up your own dialogue."
3003601 3006036 He made up the stuff when<br />he's in the boat and he says,
3006120 3008669 "You're gonna wish your<br />mothers never met your fathers
3008756 3010747 "when you start piling<br />into those reefs, boy."
3010991 3014234 Wait till we get them silly<br />bastards down in that rock pile.
3014345 3015345 There'll be some fun.
3015446 3017972 They'll wish their fathers<br />hadn't met their mothers
3018082 3019675 when they start digging the bottoms out
3019767 3021610 and slamming into them rocks, boy.
3021719 3021921 There's no shortage<br />of drunks on the island.
3021936 3024234 There's no shortage<br />of drunks on the island.
3024305 3027673 Craig Kings bury had the<br />distinction of being the only guy
3027741 3031041 who was driving under the<br />influence a team of oxen.
3031362 3035048 And was loaded and smashed<br />and driving these cows around.
3035366 3039462 Just in talking about fishing<br />and sharking and this and that,
3039853 3042151 Craig gave me some great lines.
3043107 3045007 One of the lines was,
3045109 3049706 "It's not like going out there to<br />catch bluegills or Tommy cods."
3049797 3051276 That's Craig's line.
3051382 3053009 I'll catch this bird for you.
3053117 3055552 It ain't going to<br />be easy. Bad fish.
3056437 3057848 Not like going down to the pond
3057955 3060606 and chasing bluegills or Tommy cods.
3061809 3064119 This shark, swallow you whole.
3064612 3068924 Craig Kings bury, because he played<br />Ben Gardner, got to have his head
3070034 3072298 life-cast for the mold
3073337 3076455 for the severed head<br />that appears in the film.
3083414 3087214 The thing that really has lasted<br />through the years with Steven and me
3087318 3089195 is a very private code.
3090371 3093682 At the dinner table scene,<br />I improvised something
3094425 3096302 about a Cousteau show I had seen.
3096377 3099688 And years later, 20 years later,
3099797 3103279 Sid and I were given an award<br />by the Wiesenthal Center,
3103484 3107011 and Steven was the one who<br />presented it on their behalf.
3107438 3110601 He talked about Sid and<br />all the things he's done,
3111008 3113488 and presented his whatever,
3113611 3117855 and then introduced me and told<br />about the things that I've been doing.
3117931 3122391 Then, as he turned to me, he said,<br />"Lorraine, remember the sea otter?"
3122620 3123815 Marker.
3134999 3138196 Did you ever see the television special,
3138302 3139929 the Cousteau special on sea otters?
3140037 3143086 Sea otters, where the mother<br />was killed in front of the baby.
3143157 3144989 The baby saw it with his eyes.
3145059 3146800 You could see the tears<br />coming down his face.
3146894 3150057 It was the most incredible thing<br />I have ever seen. It was terrible.
3150164 3153259 Mikey wanted us to<br />adopt the sea otter. It was…
3153434 3157678 I've never been this moved by<br />anything on television. It was really…
3157805 3159330 It was special.
3160024 3161321 So…
3162326 3166536 You're going on the Aurora. You're<br />going to live there 18 months. Wow.
3167281 3169648 It was disappointing to me<br />it wasn't in the movie.
3169717 3173199 Not as disappointing as not having<br />a sex scene with Richard Dreyfuss,
3173287 3175028 but it was disappointing.
3182463 3184932 Shark! A shark!
3188152 3190587 <i>I was going to be a victim in the estuary.</i>
3190688 3193157 <i>I'm in a little rowboat.</i>
3193374 3196583 The way they shot it the first time,
3196694 3200210 I'm in the shark's mouth<br />with a blood pack in my mouth.
3200280 3204524 I'm going on top of water,<br />underwater, spitting blood out,
3204635 3206535 and I'm trying to make a lot of movement,
3206637 3209868 but it was very awkward<br />the way this seat was.
3209957 3213234 I was trying to make a lot of<br />movement like I was in the shark's mouth.
3213327 3214658 Going underwater, top of water.
3214762 3216287 Then I see
3217848 3220397 Roy's son staring at me.
3220484 3223715 As a last-ditch effort, the shark<br />is heading right towards him.
3223821 3226973 I just make a move to<br />grab him, and I let him just…
3227040 3228974 I just touched him and let him go,
3229042 3230976 and then I go underwater and disappear.
3231245 3233407 What happened in that scene is,
3233514 3236142 it was so violent and so horrendous
3236316 3240583 <i>that they couldn't use it. It<br />was just too violent, period.</i>
3243207 3246006 <i>I was in this bucket seat,<br />strapped into it,</i>
3246110 3248522 <i>and the shark fin was behind me on a sled.</i>
3248629 3252429 <i>I had the kid in my arms, and I<br />was gonna take him underwater.</i>
3252533 3256060 <i>Then I let him go, and<br />the sled went underwater.</i>
3260224 3262738 Teddy Grossman is in<br />the jaws of the shark.
3262810 3264073 The shark's underwater.
3264178 3267523 And Teddy, like the maidenhead on a ship,
3268081 3271164 is traveling toward<br />this kid, vomiting blood.
3271285 3274346 That's much more horrible<br />than what I had done,
3274455 3277390 you know, in the first third of <i>Jaws</i>.
3277541 3279851 I just didn't like it.<br />It was too bloody.
3279927 3281986 I thought it was in<br />bad taste, so I cut it out.
3282996 3286455 Come on, Chief. This<br />isn't no Boy Scout picnic.
3286917 3289033 See you got your rubbers.
3289102 3292811 I asked Robert to<br />give Lorraine a hard time
3293157 3294716 inside the scene,
3295042 3298478 'cause he's really sort of<br />putting down Chief Brody.
3298645 3301012 He thinks Chief Brady's a sissy.
3301114 3304163 He's putting down the fact<br />he's all in rubber.
3304268 3307363 He says, "Are you glad you<br />brought your rubbers, Chief?"
3307471 3310202 And he's always doing this to everybody,
3310591 3313492 to Brady's character,<br />to Brody and to Hooper.
3314595 3318054 And so I asked him to chide Lorraine,
3318131 3320156 and in the middle of the scene
3320234 3322396 he made up this little poem that went,
3322870 3327023 "There was a woman named Mary<br />Who lost her virginity
3328442 3330274 "Not a bad record for this vicinity"
3330344 3331869 Whatever it was, when it was over,
3331962 3333771 I said, "You gotta help me clear this.
3333881 3335315 "If that's from a song,
3335415 3338134 "we just can't use that<br />without paying for the rights."
3338235 3342399 He said, "I don't think we'll be sued.<br />I got it from a tombstone in Ireland."
3342506 3345089 <i>That's where he found that little ditty.</i>
3345242 3349827 "Here lies the body of Mary<br />Lee Died at the age of 103
3349897 3352525 "For 15 years she kept her virginity
3352633 3354852 "Not a bad record for this vicinity"
3357070 3361018 If they don't like you<br />going out, they'll love you coming in.
3367714 3370991 <i>For</i> Jaws, <i>I<br />wanted the color red to be the blood</i>
3371268 3374636 <i>and not to be a bandana<br />around someone's neck</i>
3374821 3378815 <i>or a plaid over shirt<br />or the letters on a boat.</i>
3379092 3381322 The only red I wanted<br />in the movie was blood.
3381395 3384456 I told the production designer,<br />Joe Alves, at the very beginning,
3384565 3386363 "When you're designing the picture
3386466 3389185 "and finding your colors, don't find red.
3389286 3391562 "Just allow red to be the blood."
3392139 3394301 And, in a sense, I think we stuck to that.
3394374 3396183 I think that's what happened.
3396293 3400105 We did have red wine,<br />but it's a bit symbolic.
3405102 3406581 Keep that chum line going, Chief.
3406670 3408365 We got five good miles on it.
3408472 3410736 <i>When the shooting started at sea,</i>
3410841 3412957 <i>the production got a lot more difficult.</i>
3413393 3416670 That's when they started<br />worrying about wind and weather,
3416763 3418857 when they could spend a day on the ocean
3418966 3421446 and get six seconds of usable film
3421535 3423082 because of boats on the horizon,
3423170 3424752 because of malfunctioning shark.
3424855 3427904 The problems of shooting<br />at sea are enormous
3427975 3432242 because the wind, the waves,<br />everything is moving
3432779 3437148 and nothing stays the same<br />for more than 50, 60 seconds.
3437417 3440296 I would set up a shot and<br />I'd get my camera all set.
3440404 3442714 Suddenly the electrical barge<br />would start drifting,
3442789 3444302 the tide would be moving this way,
3444408 3446718 and the camera barge<br />would start drifting this way,
3446793 3449421 and the Orca would start<br />moving around on its two anchors.
3449529 3451714 Before you knew it,<br />we were all out of position.
3451798 3454779 It took another hour and a half<br />to re-anchor and get set again.
3454885 3458048 Just when we got set, sailboats<br />from a regatta would come in.
3458155 3460806 You're shooting<br />towards the horizon, right?
3461208 3463984 And the camera has got the horizon.
3467748 3470900 Then all of a sudden<br />we would see a little sail.
3472369 3475816 <i>And as soon as that sail<br />was in the shot, we had to stop</i>
3476440 3480650 and wait till it went<br />all the way across here,
3480744 3482644 which took an hour and a half.
3482929 3485739 And hope that at the end<br />of that hour and a half,
3485832 3487812 another one didn't come.
3488235 3490112 So we were always like…
3490937 3494771 As the sailing ship went off,
3495759 3499969 we were going, like, "Ready?<br />Speed. Action!
3500047 3502573 "No, there's another one!<br />Oh, God damn it!"
3503583 3506245 I mean, that put three hours<br />a day onto our schedule.
3506319 3507787 I'd sit there saying,
3507854 3510482 "Do I wait here for an<br />hour for the regatta to pass,
3510674 3514577 "or do we turn 18 to 25 anchors,
3514678 3516942 "move everything to look<br />in this direction?"
3517047 3519061 We used to do calculations and say,
3519149 3522210 "It'll take an hour for the<br />regatta to get from here to here,
3522319 3524310 "and an hour and 10 minutes
3524421 3527231 "to get all your anchors<br />and look back this way.
3527874 3531424 "Let's wait for the sailboats<br />to move out of the shot."
3531611 3534239 It was just frustrating for all of us.
3536600 3538762 <i>Everyone got seasick. Sooner or later,</i>
3538869 3540394 <i>everybody got seasick.</i>
3540871 3544819 Robert was really, really seasick one day.
3546359 3549442 And he had to shoot a line,<br />a very simple line.
3550630 3554077 The line was, "Hooper,<br />you idiot, ain't you watching?"
3554367 3557997 Okay? He had to be<br />helped into the chair.
3558822 3561200 And anyone touching him…
3561274 3563356 It hurt him just to be touched.
3565095 3567826 And we were all hoping that he'd get it.
3569199 3573477 Nobody was critical.<br />Nobody was mocking.
3573553 3576579 Nobody was standing apart<br />and pointing fingers.
3576656 3580741 We all knew exactly what he<br />was feeling. He just couldn't help it.
3582395 3585444 But we also knew that he<br />wouldn't be able to do this,
3585549 3588917 that this scene, however<br />small and of-the-moment,
3589669 3591660 would not get done today.
3594024 3596015 Steven set up the camera.
3596226 3600288 Robert was here, and he had to<br />turn into the camera to say this line.
3600397 3604300 He was… He literally… He went…
3616329 3617956 I mean, it hurt.
3619416 3621316 Steven said, "Action."
3622586 3624418 Robert turned around,
3624521 3628151 and with a power that<br />put me through the wall,
3628525 3630801 he went, "Hooper, you<br />idiot, ain't you watching?"
3630894 3633886 Ho open you idiot,<br />starboard! Ain't you watching it!
3634080 3636890 And I swear to God, everyone went…
3638135 3641332 And then Steven said, "Cut!<br />Print!" And Robert went…
3641438 3642917 Collapse.
3661675 3663302 You're going to need a bigger boat.
3663376 3666823 One of the most remembered<br />and oft-quoted lines in the movie
3666930 3670161 is Roy Scheider saying,<br />"We gotta get a bigger boat,"
3670267 3671883 which he improvised on the set,
3671952 3673420 and I acknowledge that as a writer.
3673486 3674783 I'm pleased that he said that.
3675205 3678015 The line, "We're gonna<br />need a bigger boat,"
3678375 3681652 has become part of the language
3682028 3685271 for people who are faced with<br />an insurmountable problem.
3695559 3696856 That's a 20-footer.
3696927 3698190 Twenty-five.
3698862 3700239 Three tons of him.
3700330 3704858 The studio was overloaded with<br />their own effects projects at the time,
3705518 3707498 <i>Hindenburg and Earthquake.</i>
3707787 3709767 Marshall Green, the<br />head of production, said,
3709873 3712524 "Take it, find someone to do it."
3712976 3715991 So I started interviewing<br />various effects people,
3716062 3719999 and I went to Disney's and other places
3720066 3723627 that do mechanical objects,
3723703 3726047 animals and what have you.
3726323 3727939 I wasn't having any luck.
3728008 3729954 Everybody was telling me,<br />"It can't be done.
3730060 3732529 "It would take three<br />years in development."
3732629 3737533 I heard about this guy that<br />had been retired for some time,
3737968 3741484 <i>who did the giant squid in</i><br />20,000 <i>Leagues</i> Under <i>the Sea.</i>
3742439 3744555 <i>And his name was Bob Mattey.</i>
3745292 3747169 <i>So, when I met Bob,</i>
3747277 3750656 <i>I didn't get the usual<br />pessimistic attitude,</i>
3750730 3752243 <i>"You can't do this.</i>
3752349 3756092 <i>"You can't make this full-size<br />shark and shoot in the real ocean."</i>
3757087 3758885 Instead I got this very enthusiastic,
3758989 3760673 "Yes, we could do anything."
3762142 3764088 Probably
3765095 3769191 the reason that Steven and I decided,
3769666 3771828 in a naive sort of way,
3771935 3775371 that we were gonna build a full-size<br />shark and shoot the real ocean
3775472 3777952 and not a tank or not a miniature…
3779643 3782271 Maybe that was lack of<br />experience or whatever,
3782379 3785474 but everyone kept telling us<br />we couldn't do it.
3785899 3788015 So when I found Bob Mattey,
3788118 3790849 who actually had made<br />some of these giant creatures,
3790954 3794504 very enthusiastic about it,<br />it was very encouraging.
3816246 3818874 It had to be a formidable shark.
3820250 3824448 <i>And we made various sketches of<br />30-foot sharks and 20-foot sharks,</i>
3824904 3827783 <i>and came up with the… A<br />reasonable size would be 25 feet.</i>
3827891 3831088 <i>Very formidable, yet not Moby Dick.</i>
3831795 3835231 There have been sharks that have<br />been sighted that have been that size,
3835332 3838063 and they've actually caught<br />some that were 21 feet.
3838168 3840694 So it was a credible<br />animal we were making.
3840804 3843956 Doing the initial studies<br />of the great white shark,
3844024 3846322 I went to the Steinhardt
3846393 3850910 and I borrowed this set<br />of jaws which was huge.
3851448 3854349 It's an 18, 20-foot shark.
3854751 3858836 We made our shark larger<br />by another five or six feet,
3859089 3861615 but we kept everything in proportion.
3861725 3865821 Teeth. When I started<br />doing the actual drawings
3867247 3870046 for the construction of the shark,
3870133 3872875 we used everything in proper proportion.
3899062 3901292 Getting the right personnel<br />was sort of like…
3901398 3902695 <i>It reminds me of The Magnificent Seven</i>
3902799 3905234 where you're picking six great guys,
3905335 3906552 six big guns.
3909406 3914185 We heard of this young man<br />in the plastics section
3914294 3916137 by the name of Roy Arbogast.
3916246 3917873 He was an expert
3917981 3921144 on rubber forms and new<br />plastics, and things like that.
3921618 3924883 So we decided he would<br />be perfect to make the mold.
3924988 3927207 There was Richie Helmer and Bill Short,
3927273 3929742 who were excellent in electronics.
3930994 3935363 All this had to be<br />electrically-activated valves
3935465 3938844 that would work the rams<br />and various things of that type.
3938918 3942161 We were using hydraulics<br />instead of pneumatics because“.
3942272 3945583 Excuse me. We were using<br />pneumatics instead of hydraulics
3945658 3948252 because we didn't want<br />an oil break in the water.
3948328 3950319 So we had to get hydraulic experts too.
3950447 3953348 Then we had Mike and Gary<br />Woods, who were excellent welders.
3953450 3955498 <i>So we assembled this team,</i>
3956019 3959137 <i>and they started on<br />the frame of the shark.</i>
3959873 3963923 <i>So we were working from the<br />outside in and the inside out.</i>
3964461 3966452 <i>We were separately modeling the shark,</i>
3966563 3969464 <i>and then, at the same time,<br />they were making the skeleton,</i>
3969566 3971978 <i>and we hoped that<br />they would all fit together.</i>
3972051 3973394 <i>And there was a time element.</i>
3973503 3975403 <i>The time element was this…</i>
3975505 3980352 <i>It was that it was already<br />the first of the year in 1974,</i>
3980944 3984562 <i>and we knew we would have a<br />summer window in which to shoot this,</i>
3984631 3986622 <i>especially that we're gonna go back east.</i>
3986733 3990044 <i>We decided to shoot this in the<br />area it was written for, New England.</i>
3990153 3992622 So we had a time element there.
3993740 3996323 We built the shark<br />and tested the shark dry.
4011391 4015919 We were asked to make comments<br />about the mechanical shark,
4016079 4018764 and I think it helped them<br />to a certain extent.
4018882 4023570 Because I think they had too<br />much animation in the shark.
4024003 4026517 The shark, in reality,
4027040 4029987 moves in a very smooth, leisurely manner.
4030143 4034410 I can remember it sort of coming<br />up out of the water like that,
4034531 4037262 very fast vertically,<br />and they don't do that.
4037367 4038698 They sort of come up…
4040303 4043739 It's a slow… It's not really<br />slow, but it looks slow.
4044023 4046424 They took our advice,
4046492 4049735 and I know that it made a<br />big difference to the end result.
4063810 4065926 We had a number of<br />different shark components.
4066029 4070341 We had the full shark, which<br />I called the "great white turd."
4071301 4073736 We pulled it along in the water.
4073820 4077233 It was often on this huge<br />gantry like a crane arm.
4077574 4080657 When the crane arm was<br />tucked at the 30-foot bottom,
4080727 4081819 you couldn't see the shark.
4081945 4085563 But when the crane arm… As<br />quickly as they could blow the ballast
4085632 4087100 and force the arm out of the water,
4087166 4089476 the shark would rise out of the water.
4089586 4092362 The shark could be gimbaled<br />separately on the arm
4092438 4095738 to have an attitude change<br />at the top of the crane arm.
4095808 4099790 We had that. We had just a fin<br />that was pulled through the water.
4107220 4110702 We had a left-to-right shark<br />and a right-to-left shark.
4111190 4113750 The left-to-right shark, of course,
4114193 4117436 had no left side.<br />It was all scooped out.
4120833 4123097 <i>And vice versa for the other shark.</i>
4130243 4133087 Bob needed some area like this
4133363 4136879 that he could get all those hoses
4137317 4139001 and wires and stuff,
4139152 4143885 and have access to all<br />the mechanical stuff here.
4145792 4147635 Whatever needed to be repaired.
4147744 4150520 If we were shooting this<br />one with the hole here,
4150596 4152906 we could only shoot from the other side.
4153016 4155166 So this would be the left-to-right shark.
4155234 4158750 The idea still was to<br />try to convince the world
4159339 4161956 that we were using real sharks
4162058 4163901 or a great deal of real sharks.
4165028 4169272 So we didn't want the world to know
4169716 4173129 that the monster was really mechanical.
4174520 4176921 And also, we realized
4178441 4181775 that a mechanical monster<br />is only good when it moves.
4182679 4185922 When you take a still photograph of it,
4185998 4189445 it's gonna look phony under<br />the best of circumstances.
4194624 4199209 Somebody snuck in somehow into<br />the warehouse while we were shooting
4199645 4202376 and took a picture of one of the sharks.
4202548 4206109 And I remember getting<br />very agitated about that.
4209539 4212065 And none of us could understand,
4212225 4216059 because we really were very<br />careful about the secrecy element,
4216129 4219963 almost became paranoid about it.
4220450 4223397 But, in itself, the fact that
4224087 4226931 there was such secrecy surrounding this
4227240 4229334 created a great deal of interest.
4230777 4233895 That's a much-maligned shark,<br />and I'm kind of responsible
4233980 4237245 for creating a lot of the<br />badmouthing about the shark.
4237316 4238898 Because the shark was frustrating.
4238985 4240783 It didn't really work all the time.
4240870 4242304 It didn't work hardly at all.
4242505 4247159 I remember, in particular,<br />being on our barge,
4247326 4250318 watching the first shark test,
4251063 4253691 at which time the shark simply sank
4253800 4256326 to the bottom of Nantucket Sound.
4256486 4260434 And we felt that our careers in<br />motion pictures had gone with it.
4260540 4264704 Frogmen were delegated to recover<br />it and bring it back to the surface.
4264894 4267295 Everything that could<br />go wrong with a shark
4267380 4269439 went wrong with the various sharks,
4269549 4271643 the various types, head, fin, tails.
4271717 4274402 The ocean was so brutal on the mechanics.
4274504 4275915 All the pneumatic tubes,
4275988 4280858 all of that special equipment<br />was being dashed
4280927 4283555 and brutalized by the ocean every day.
4283729 4287097 There were all these radio<br />mikes all over the island,
4287366 4289812 the Universal radio mikes.
4290186 4291950 So wherever you were on the island,
4292038 4294200 you could hear the radio mikes.
4294373 4295863 They were always saying,
4295942 4297307 "The shark is not working.
4297376 4300835 "Repeat.<br />The shark is not working."
4301581 4303675 No matter where you were, and for months.
4303749 4306696 We just waited around.<br />We just waited and waited.
4306803 4309738 I remember every day, about<br />the 50th or 60th day of shooting,
4309839 4312331 the crew would come over<br />to me, and they'd all ask me,
4312425 4314484 "When are we going to<br />be done with this movie?"
4314577 4316488 And I would honestly say to them,
4316596 4319213 with complete sympathy for the question,
4319949 4323351 "I don't know. I don't know when<br />we're going to finish this movie.
4323436 4326895 "We could finish it if I get<br />fired and dragged off the movie.
4326973 4330238 "Somebody else could come and<br />finish it. Maybe they'll shut us down."
4331878 4334404 Show me the way to <i>go</i> home
4335515 4338143 <i>I'm tired and I want to go to bed</i>
4338417 4340818 <i>I had a little drink about an hour ago</i>
4340887 4342878 <i>And it's gone right to my head</i>
4343422 4347620 I remember how we got tears in<br />our eyes when we sang the song.
4347693 4349525 <i>Show me the way to go home</i>
4350062 4352690 <i>I'm tired and I want to go to bed</i>
4353099 4355659 Which is sung in the film<br />by the three principals.
4355735 4359046 I remember looking around<br />at Charlsie, the script girl,
4359155 4361749 and other people on the set<br />with tears in their eyes,
4361858 4364702 not because it was<br />a sweet, emotional scene.
4365177 4366986 That had become their mantra.
4367079 4370379 All they could think about<br />was, "What was home like?"
4370533 4373810 They missed their kids, and<br />they missed their backyards.
4374170 4378437 They missed their families<br />and their lifestyles.
4379292 4383092 And, in a sense, that's why I<br />always saw myself in the negative.
4383195 4386392 <i>I saw myself as James Cagney<br />in Mister Roberts,</i>
4386465 4391084 not letting the crew get to shore.
4391254 4393450 By the way, the crew did get to shore.
4393556 4396048 They got to shore every<br />Sunday that we had off.
4396142 4397576 We shot six-day weeks.
4397660 4399207 But I never left the island.
4399312 4401303 The reason I never left the island
4401380 4404463 in all those seven months of<br />shooting on Martha's Vineyard
4404567 4406376 was because if I left the island,
4406485 4408067 I was certain I would never come back.
4408154 4410202 The delays and the ocean
4410306 4413719 and the fact that we'd been on the<br />island for four or five months now,
4413793 4416569 we were all getting a little strange.
4417697 4419210 There was a…
4419315 4423309 I don't know if it was a charity<br />dinner or not, but it was a function,
4424236 4427399 a splendid buffet of wonderful food.
4427657 4430001 There was this tremendous<br />buffet of desserts,
4430076 4432545 strawberry shortcake and Boston cream pies
4432612 4435240 and chocolate eclairs and napoleons
4436966 4440812 and some Jell-O, and<br />also gravy and potatoes.
4440886 4443867 I'd said to Rick Fields,<br />who is Verna Fields' son,
4443973 4446089 "Suppose there was a food fight?"
4446158 4447990 And he said, "What do you mean?"
4448077 4451069 I said, "Well, you know, just<br />start throwing some food."
4451163 4452403 Roy started it.
4452515 4457260 Roy threw a big glob of mashed<br />potatoes and gravy right into my face,
4458270 4461103 and before I could recover<br />and throw something at him,
4461173 4464791 Richard Dreyfuss, I think, took his<br />dessert and threw it into Roy's face.
4464894 4468012 Right center, nose, eyes,<br />mouth, the whole thing.
4468547 4471744 Roy turned and he took two or<br />three desserts, threw them at Richard.
4471817 4474127 Richard ducked and it<br />hit somebody behind him,
4474220 4476655 and it was a bit of a Three Stooges brawl.
4476739 4479071 I remember Dick and David<br />got up and left right away.
4479175 4480859 They saw what was coming.
4480926 4485272 In about 30 seconds, we were actually<br />standing, hurling food at each other.
4485381 4487645 And it was a melee after that.
4488017 4490748 Just food all over the floor, all over…
4491020 4494570 The help that was there<br />serving dinner, they came out.
4494874 4496251 They laughed like crazy.
4496359 4499920 I don't know if some of the townspeople<br />appreciated it as much as we did,
4500029 4503556 but it was a tremendous<br />blowing off of steam.
4503949 4506941 I remember Richard and Roy,<br />covered in food,
4507620 4509452 running out to the Kelley<br />House swimming pool
4509522 4511263 and diving in the water.
4511374 4514321 And all this once-yummy food,
4514777 4517257 like Technicolor silt,
4517329 4520845 rising to the surface of this<br />otherwise turquoise pool.
4521050 4522779 I remember saying, "What<br />the heck," and I jumped in too,
4522868 4525530 and washed myself off.
4525805 4527705 But that was what happens in the Navy
4527790 4529804 when you just aren't given shore leave.
4529875 4531070 Let that be a lesson.
4531160 4535438 The decision to continue filming<br />Jaws was a very shaky one.
4536332 4539074 Our technical people,<br />what Steven Spielberg
4539168 4542547 was fond of calling "our<br />special defects department,"
4544340 4547253 wanted us to stop<br />so they could perfect it.
4548811 4553658 Dick and I, battle-scarred<br />veterans of the movie wars,
4553733 4557681 knew that you never take<br />the film out of the camera
4557787 4560028 because they may never<br />let you put it back,
4560106 4562040 particularly with a movie like this.
4562108 4566818 Even if we got one-sixteenth of a<br />page of script a day, you kept moving.
4567997 4572047 Steven, at one point, considered<br />moving our whole crew to the Bahamas,
4572118 4574416 where the waters were<br />tranquil and everything,
4574487 4576421 and we weren't in favor of that.
4576489 4578435 "Just keep shooting.
4578541 4581283 "Keep shooting and make do<br />with what you've got."
4581393 4584693 This whole system with the barrels,
4584764 4586277 that kept the shark alive.
4586482 4590225 <i>When those barrels came up,<br />the shark was there,</i>
4590553 4592237 and that really saved us.
4592505 4596339 It saved us, or we'd still be there<br />waiting for the shark to work, really.
4596408 4599503 Finally, after all this,<br />it was maybe September,
4599578 4602297 we got the shark to<br />raise out of the water.
4602398 4605129 That was that one shot with Roy Scheider,
4605768 4607350 and it just barely worked.
4607520 4608612 Okay.
4610406 4612522 Good blood.<br />And action, Roy.
4612591 4613717 Slow ahead.
4613793 4615409 I can go slow ahead.
4615511 4618572 You ought to come down<br />and ladle some of this shit.
4622968 4624060 <i>And down!</i>
4630376 4631434 <i>And cut!</i>
4631694 4635426 And then one day you heard<br />this, "The shark is working.
4636265 4638256 "Repeat.<br />The shark is working."
4638450 4641431 The shark worked well enough that we,
4641987 4644297 for a while there, had<br />the biggest hit of all time.
4644390 4645858 I really owe the shark a lot.
4645925 4648610 More than I want to take<br />away from it right now.
4648711 4650975 And I owe Bob Mattey<br />and his team a lot as well.
4651347 4655716 The shark in Jaws,<br />and all subsequent editions,
4655818 4657400 was always called Bruce.
4657469 4661554 The reason it was called Bruce<br />is because Steven named him that
4661774 4663924 after his lawyer, Bruce Ramer.
4664093 4668007 I didn't make jokes about it. I<br />never called the shark Bruce. Ever.
4668097 4669565 I Still don't.
4674837 4677681 <i>There was one Orca,<br />which was originally called the Warlock.</i>
4677756 4681374 It was a boat that was purchased<br />by Joe Alves, the production designer.
4681477 4685857 He chose the boat, and I liked the<br />boat a lot, but I didn't think it was…
4685948 4687643 It didn't have enough character to it.
4687750 4691596 Joe agreed, and Joe actually<br />replaced the entire wheelhouse
4691854 4694084 with one of his own<br />design with larger windows,
4694190 4695555 'cause they were too small.
4695658 4698286 Joe and I both wanted larger<br />windows so we could see out.
4698394 4700021 So everywhere you were inside the boat,
4700129 4702291 the ocean was breathing down your neck.
4702398 4705231 Rather than looking through a<br />porthole and saying, "The ocean."
4705334 4707018 That could have been a processed shot.
4707086 4709362 So I wanted really big<br />windows in the wheelhouse,
4709455 4710672 in the main cabin.
4710773 4713891 Joe reconfigured the boat to<br />give it a little more personality,
4713976 4717355 squared off a little bit more than<br />the original boat we bought was.
4717429 4722048 We were shooting about<br />75 yards, I'm really not sure,
4722701 4725432 off the coast of Chappaquiddick Island.
4725804 4729957 Robert, Roy, myself,
4731360 4733795 Freddy Zendar, the boat wrangler,
4734530 4738694 and an ancient sound man with a Nagra.
4739001 4743131 What happened was, we were pulling<br />one of the barrels away from the boat.
4743239 4747119 They had put a little eye hook<br />into one of the boards,
4748277 4752657 just below the surface, just<br />below the waterline, like a shiv.
4752731 4754813 So the rope would go through the shiv,
4754917 4757978 and it would seem to pull<br />the barrel toward the Orca,
4758087 4760033 as if the shark was<br />heading toward the Orca.
4760105 4762403 The problem was,<br />the motorboat went so fast,
4762474 4765421 it pulled the shiv and the planking
4765511 4768629 out from the hull of the Orca<br />and, of course, the water rushed in.
4768731 4771257 And we started to sink.<br />No kidding.
4771567 4772932 No kidding.
4773369 4775838 Water started rushing onto the boat.
4775938 4780057 Freddy Zendar jumps up from the<br />hold cursing and screaming in Austrian,
4780125 4782537 and starts to power the boat<br />as fast as he could
4782645 4785444 toward the beach of Chappaquiddick Island,
4785531 4787750 hoping to be able to ground the boat
4787850 4790376 before it sinks and we have no Orca.
4791053 4792896 There's only one Orca.
4793505 4796531 In the meantime, we're in six-foot swells,
4796608 4800294 and Steven Spielberg is<br />trying to send safety boats
4800396 4803229 to get us transferred off the boat.
4803332 4806393 "Get the actors off the boat!"
4806502 4806603 I remember John Carter, who<br />won an Academy Award, by the way,
4806618 4809553 I remember John Carter, who<br />won an Academy Award, by the way,
4809621 4812306 for best sound for Jaws.
4812891 4816759 He picked up the Nagra<br />and held it over his head
4816829 4819764 and said, "Fuck the actors,<br />save the sound department!"
4819832 4821948 I have this image to this day of John
4822051 4824145 sinking, holding the Nagra over his head,
4824253 4826836 the water up to John's<br />ankles, up to his knees,
4826905 4829852 boats scrambling to pull<br />everybody off the sinking Orca,
4829942 4831592 and John with his Nagra going under.
4831694 4834891 There was a certain level<br />of executive indifference
4834997 4838206 to the sound department's lifespan.
4838901 4841120 "Get the actors off the boat!"
4844823 4846063 It was funny.
4847710 4848802 We lived.
4848961 4850872 We had lost the camera. The<br />camera was on the boat, too.
4850963 4852704 It went underwater.
4852815 4855716 Bill Butler said, "You know, in a sense,
4855968 4858869 "the developing solution<br />we use is a saline solution.
4858937 4862237 "I think this film's going to be<br />okay if we can rush it to the |ab."
4862358 4865441 We got on an airplane with a<br />bucket of water and the film in it,
4865511 4868037 took it to New York and developed it.
4868130 4869825 Didn't lose a foot.
4870366 4872733 Bill Butler created<br />equipment just to make Jaws.
4872835 4874883 He created a camera platform that
4874953 4877513 according to the tides or<br />where you wanted your lens,
4877589 4879455 could go just below the surface
4879525 4881266 or way above the surface of the water.
4881377 4884369 He designed it and<br />had it built for the movie.
4884480 4885480 He also created…
4885581 4889279 He had to create the water<br />box, where you put the camera.
4889385 4893629 <i>But he reconfigured the water<br />box so it was easier to get the focus.</i>
4893906 4896125 <i>Your hand in there so you could pull focus</i>
4896225 4899126 <i>and still have the water lapping the lens.</i>
4899228 4901390 I wanted this movie<br />to be just at water level,
4901497 4903295 the way we are when we're treading water.
4903399 4906926 We don't see water three feet off<br />the water. We see water like this.
4907019 4908748 I wanted to get the camera right down
4908821 4910767 to where the human point of view
4910873 4913399 is most accustomed to being<br />when you're swimming.
4913509 4916877 That's why I shot<br />at least 25% of the movie
4916979 4920142 from that water box that<br />Bill Butler reconfigured for us.
4920249 4922445 When it came time to do Jaws…
4923152 4926235 They hadn't done a water<br />picture for several years,
4926305 4930321 and the old-fashioned way of doing<br />a water picture was to use a gimbal.
4930426 4933305 It weighs about 400 pounds.<br />It's very clumsy.
4933429 4936262 It does keep the camera level aboard ship,
4936799 4941487 but it's too clumsy to do a<br />film the way they do films today.
4942171 4944856 And so I chose to hand-hold the camera.
4945374 4949060 When Steven heard about this<br />he was rather shocked,
4949178 4951977 because he didn't really<br />want a hand-held picture.
4952064 4955443 But he didn't realize<br />that I didn't really mean
4955551 4958111 to do a hand-held film
4958287 4961803 in the terms that they<br />then used or thought about
4961874 4963342 hand-held on land,
4963408 4965172 but rather to use the knees
4965244 4967713 <i>and the body to take<br />the roll out of the film.</i>
4967930 4972561 <i>And so we gave that a try,<br />and it worked very well.</i>
4974203 4975921 <i>After he saw a demonstration,</i>
4975988 4978207 he decided that was the way to do it.
4978307 4982084 As a matter of fact, Jaws ended up<br />being a film shot mostly hand-held.
4982311 4984552 One thing I remember<br />more than anything else
4984630 4987474 has nothing to do with<br />the direction of the picture,
4987583 4990951 but has to do with the<br />incredible contrasts of light.
4993589 4996365 You'd see a scene being shot.
4997743 5001395 From one angle it's dark,<br />from the other angle it's light.
5001497 5004228 Sunshine, fog.
5007286 5008868 I remember thinking to myself,
5008971 5011588 "My God! How are you<br />gonna cut this together?
5011657 5014501 "How are you ever gonna get the color
5016662 5019245 "to bear anything resembling a match?"
5019348 5020975 I'd never seen…
5021884 5024979 The islands and oceans have<br />such incredible differences.
5025087 5027886 The ocean is green, it's blue, it's black.
5028006 5030418 Sometimes the sky was blue instead of
5030526 5032893 the overcast gray look<br />that we really wanted.
5034363 5037139 When we got back to LA,<br />we had to take it into the lab
5037266 5038779 and get rid of the blue.
5038850 5043003 At the time, the special<br />effects people didn't really have
5043105 5047690 a good way of pulling the blue out<br />of the film without affecting the faces.
5048010 5050695 We wanted the faces to remain untouched.
5050963 5055275 And so I decided to try something<br />that they hadn't tried before,
5055384 5057898 which was simply to use<br />black-and-white film,
5057970 5059278 the type they do letters with,
5059388 5061334 which is either black or it's white,
5061406 5065274 expose it for the very<br />bright sky with a blue filter,
5065344 5069190 and take only the blue of the<br />sky out and leave the faces alone.
5069298 5071096 It happened to work very well,
5071183 5074562 and we were able to match<br />shots very well that way.
5075704 5077718 Want to see something permanent?
5081944 5083924 That was Robert's idea.
5083996 5086943 Robert Shaw said, "I've<br />got this tooth that's fake."
5087099 5090114 He pulled his cap off and<br />the little nub was under it.
5090202 5092193 He said, "Can I take that off
5092271 5094467 "as an addition to<br />the scar-comparing contest?"
5095357 5098475 Mr. Hooper, that's<br />the U. S. S. Indianapolis.
5105801 5107860 <i>You were on the Indianapolis?</i>
5107970 5109995 <i>The Indianapolis speech</i>
5110455 5114323 about the atomic bomb that had<br />been taken from Tinian to Leyte
5114393 5116760 which, for me, is my<br />favorite part of Jaws,
5116828 5119490 this speech that Shaw gives about that.
5120499 5123230 That was conceived by Howard Sackler,
5123302 5126135 who only really wrote a short paragraph
5127389 5131769 as Quint starts to talk about one<br />of the reasons he kills sharks today
5131877 5135939 is what sharks did to him and<br />his shipmates back in 1945.
5137316 5139717 It was a wonderful scene
5139785 5141833 that I kept trying to get<br />Howard Sackler to expand.
5141937 5144053 But Howard felt shorter was better,
5144122 5146216 and never would elaborate on it.
5146375 5148616 One day I was talking to John Milius,
5148694 5151254 and I said, "Could you make this longer?
5151330 5152547 "Because I think it's a speech,
5152648 5155231 "not just a couple of short paragraphs."
5155500 5158629 John said, "Sure, I love the<br />speech. It's a great idea. I'll try."
5158704 5162390 So John sat down and wrote page<br />after page in long hand,I believe,
5162491 5165108 and sent me an actual,<br />original longhand version
5165177 5168169 of a very long Quint speech,
5168664 5171816 which was essentially too much,
5172517 5176078 but, pared down, it was gonna be great.
5176805 5178113 When Robert Shaw read it…
5178190 5180818 Shaw, who himself had<br />written Man in the <i>Glass</i> Booth,
5180892 5182883 was an accomplished playwright.
5183095 5186292 Shaw said, "It's too hard for me to play.
5186365 5189460 "There's too much John Huston<br />in some of this dialogue.
5189634 5192467 "Huston could say this, but I<br />can't say it as well as Huston.
5192537 5194255 "Let me have a chance at rewriting it."
5194356 5198008 So then Shaw rewrote Milius,<br />who had rewritten Sackler,
5198310 5199960 and the speech in the movie
5200062 5203748 is basically Shaw's version of<br />Milius' version of Sackler's version.
5204282 5207582 Very first light, sharks come cruising
5208220 5210700 so we formed ourselves into tight groups.
5212007 5214521 You know, kind of like old squares
5214593 5216527 in a battle like you see on a calendar
5216595 5219030 like the Battle of Waterloo. The idea was…
5219131 5221031 the shark comes to the nearest man
5221133 5223795 and he starts pounding,<br />hollering and screaming.
5223869 5226110 Sometimes the shark would go away…
5227556 5229502 but sometimes he wouldn't go away.
5229574 5231804 The final telling of the Indianapolis tale
5231877 5234141 was one of the most riveting…
5235514 5238779 Sometimes when you're<br />watching another actor tell a story,
5239151 5241142 you're making up your interest.
5244222 5246247 When Robert told that story,
5247676 5249690 I couldn't keep my eyes off him.
5249895 5252990 In both the book and the<br />early versions of the script,
5254633 5258592 Quint is harpooning the shark,
5259271 5262286 his leg gets caught in the rope,<br />he gets dragged over the side
5262374 5266436 to his death, where he drowns and<br />is probably bitten too, as far as I know.
5267979 5270539 <i>He dies the way Ahab dies</i> in <i>Moby Dick.</i>
5274019 5278331 <i>It always seemed to us that if Quint<br />is gonna die, he should be bitten.</i>
5278874 5280968 <i>The best would be if he<br />could go mano a mane</i>
5281076 5283090 <i>and stab the shark, which he does.</i>
5284396 5288230 <i>His formidable human talents are no match</i>
5288300 5291270 <i>for the formidable<br />shark talents of the fish.</i>
5291787 5294870 <i>So we chose the ending<br />that we have in the movie,</i>
5294940 5299377 <i>which is that he slides into the great<br />jaws of the fish and gets chomped.</i>
5304015 5306950 And Scheider sees it and is terrified.
5315327 5319525 The second Orca that was<br />constructed was built just to sink,
5319598 5322533 and then pump air back in the ballast
5322601 5325070 and it would come up for take two.
5325287 5329281 And then sink a second time, or<br /><i>as</i> many times as we had to sink it.
5329674 5332609 That was for the shot<br />where the boat starts to sink,
5332677 5336045 <i>and Roy Scheider has to<br />climb out the flipping window</i>
5336147 5338081 <i>and climb the mast as the boat goes down,</i>
5338149 5341084 and he only has one final<br />opportunity to succeed.
5341837 5343054 Damn it!
5345674 5347984 <i>The most interesting conflict</i>
5348059 5349652 <i>happened between me and Steven</i>
5349728 5351776 <i>when it came to the<br />discussion of the ending.</i>
5351880 5354156 He said to me, "The ending<br />of the book is a downer.
5354266 5357463 "The shark gets stabbed with a<br />harpoon, can't hold up the barrels,
5357536 5360267 "and eventually drowns,<br />spins slowly to the bottom,
5360338 5364070 "and the movie or the book, the<br />story ends. The characters are saved.
5364709 5366643 "That is not a big, rousing ending.
5366711 5368907 "I need a big, rousing ending."
5369714 5372206 So he said, "Here is<br />what I propose to do."
5372284 5374161 And he told me the ending he had in mind.
5374269 5378456 I said, "Steven, that is completely<br />unbelievable. It can't happen.
5378607 5383272 "A shark does not bite down on a scuba<br />tank and explode like an oil refinery."
5384362 5386353 He said, "I don't care."
5386731 5389450 He said, "if I have<br />got them for two hours,
5389551 5391133 "they will believe whatever I do
5391202 5393933 "for the next three minutes,<br />because I've got them.
5394022 5398289 "I want the audience on<br />their feet screaming at the end,
5398410 5401846 "'Yes, yes! This is what<br />should happen to this animal!"'
5401947 5405406 Which reminded me, in<br />retrospect, of the Bill Goldman thing,
5405483 5409067 which is that reality may be<br />great and truth may be wonderful,
5409154 5412067 but none of it holds a<br />candle to believability.
5412157 5414057 If the filmmaker has done his job
5414125 5417686 and brought you into<br />believability, he can do anything.
5417846 5421430 Play by the rules. Set the<br />rules, but follow the rules.
5421499 5423684 And that's exactly what Steven did.
5423952 5425534 He was right, I was wrong,
5425604 5427015 in this entire argument.
5427589 5431275 His ending brought people<br />to their feet screaming,
5431343 5433857 "Yes, yes! This is<br />the way it should be!"
5434062 5437965 And it may be incredible,<br />but it was the right thing to do.
5444673 5446607 Smile, you son of a bitch!
5459437 5461565 In <i>Duel,</i> you hear the sound of…
5461690 5465354 In fact it was a dinosaur growling
5465744 5467644 from an old "B" dinosaur picture,
5467729 5469379 when the truck went over the cliff,
5469447 5473816 'cause I had always imagined the truck<br />to be a bit like a T-rex chasing a car.
5487115 5489925 I used the very same sound effect in <i>Jaws</i>.
5490468 5492960 Almost as a bit of just a reminder
5493038 5496918 that there was a kinship<br />between both stories,
5497308 5499777 as the shark is sinking to<br />the bottom of the ocean,
5499844 5502779 <i>after it's been exploded<br />by the compressed air.</i>
5527338 5531684 <i>One of the great<br />pieces of Spielbergian genius</i>
5532227 5535686 was the fact that at the<br />end of the movie Jaws,
5536164 5538599 the Richard Dreyfuss character pops up
5539067 5540967 and they swim to shore together.
5541069 5542810 <i>This brought cheers, of course.</i>
5542887 5544867 <i>It was what the audience wanted.</i>
5546357 5548086 I used to hate the water.
5550361 5552341 I can't imagine why.
5553898 5556083 <i>When I finally did leave the island,</i>
5556184 5559882 just before the last shot, which<br />was the blowing up of the shark…
5560271 5561739 I left the island for two reasons.
5561823 5564474 One, I heard the crew wanted<br />to throw me overboard.
5564542 5568888 I didn't know whether they were going<br />to throw me overboard in cement slippers
5568997 5572900 or throw me overboard via the poop deck,
5573001 5574742 one bounce, and then into the water.
5574836 5578682 Or whether it was going<br />to be just into the water
5578757 5579997 with a two-foot sandy bottom.
5580108 5581371 I didn't know what they were gonna do,
5581476 5583467 so I thought I'd get out quickly.
5583561 5586007 I remember when I got to Boston
5586648 5588742 on the ferry.
5590034 5593231 We spent the night in Boston, and<br />the next day we were scheduled…
5593304 5596649 Dreyfuss and I had to fly back to<br />Los Angeles on American Airlines.
5596758 5600194 I vividly recall<br />getting into my hotel room
5601129 5606033 and having a complete anxiety breakdown.
5606134 5607568 I mean it's a complete…
5607669 5610297 I don't know what you would<br />call it. It was a breakdown.
5610405 5612100 I couldn't stop shaking.
5612357 5615054 My jaw was clenched.<br />I couldn't open my mouth.
5615326 5617260 I was getting electrical<br />shocks through my brain
5617328 5618944 like I was having seizures.
5619047 5620788 I know this sounds really melodramatic,
5620882 5622407 but it's exactly what happened.
5622517 5624747 Something neurological, emotional…
5624853 5626196 Something was happening to me.
5626271 5629263 It was a full panic attack,
5629340 5634323 which I don't remember ever<br />having at that level before.
5635263 5636890 I remember calling Richard up.
5636981 5640690 He was in the pub downstairs<br />and Richard came up with me.
5640902 5643018 I just said, "I'm in<br />really bad shape, Ricky."
5643087 5646387 Rick said, "Don't worry. We'll be on<br />the airplane tomorrow." Which we were.
5646724 5650968 My recollection is that we<br />showed a cut version of the film
5651980 5654711 with one big sequence missing,
5654816 5656545 without Johnny Williams' music,
5656985 5659613 in a projection room at Universal Studios.
5660305 5664993 And when the lights went on, there<br />was no reaction at all, as I recall.
5665827 5668421 I recall turning around and saying,
5668530 5670430 "Well, Sid, what do you think?"
5670532 5672000 He said, "It's okay."
5672100 5675365 Well, "okay" was like<br />being given one-half a star.
5675687 5678463 "Okay" for 159 days?
5678573 5680223 Of course it was only "okay."
5680575 5682805 It didn't have Johnny Williams' music.
5682911 5686370 It didn't have some major underwater stuff
5686481 5689007 that we filmed in the tank at MGM Studios
5689117 5691916 in order to get very<br />close angles underwater.
5692020 5693020 We couldn't get…
5693071 5695722 The waters in Martha's<br />Vineyard, both cold and murky,
5695807 5698174 wouldn't allow us to do<br />much underwater stuff.
5698243 5702225 Metro had this great Esther<br />Williams tank, as it used to be called.
5702864 5706607 So the reaction was, "Go<br />get the rest of the movie."
5706684 5708925 When they came back<br />from Martha's Vineyard,
5709037 5710766 they realized that they didn't have
5710872 5712283 the footage, as I understood it,
5712357 5716772 that they needed, of Hooper<br />and the shark together in the cage.
5717212 5718509 So I was called.
5718613 5721355 A friend of mine, Jesse<br />Wayne, recommended me.
5721432 5725209 He was called first, and, not<br />being a certified scuba diver,
5725470 5729782 he spoke to Tom Joyner, the<br />assistant director, who then called me.
5729991 5731265 I went in,
5731542 5735160 and we went down to Culver City
5735263 5738631 to MGM Studios, and<br />shot it in a tank down there.
5751496 5754181 There were three inter-cuts<br />for the sequence
5754282 5755977 where the shark attacks the cage.
5756084 5759736 One, of course, was Dick Warlock,
5760305 5765106 who was the stunt person inside<br />the cage subbing for Richard Dreyfuss.
5768630 5772510 <i>The second was the Rizzo<br />shoot with Ron and Val in Australia.</i>
5773201 5776785 And there was Frank Sparks,<br />whose eyes I actually used
5776854 5778629 to substitute Richard's eyes
5778740 5780890 because Rich was unavailable<br />for shooting the inserts.
5780959 5783439 So when you see<br />the Richard Dreyfuss scream,
5783528 5786270 that's not Richard's face,<br />those aren't Richard's eyes.
5786381 5788110 <i>That's a guy named Sparks.</i>
5796291 5797417 Help!
5798142 5802022 Down in the tank was a metal apparatus
5802130 5804224 that the shark was attached to,
5804432 5809177 where it could move forward,<br />backward, sideways, up and down.
5809454 5812503 So it had pretty good<br />movement, real natural movement.
5812890 5814722 <i>It was operated by a special effects man.</i>
5814792 5816442 <i>His name is Whitey Krumm.</i>
5855717 5857446 As Whitey was looking in one window,
5857552 5860544 watching the shark from<br />the side with the controls,
5860671 5862446 Mr. Spielberg was around the other side,
5862557 5864286 or a quarter of the way around,
5864392 5866087 looking at it from another perspective.
5866194 5869038 He was looking at the shark<br />coming directly at the cage,
5869130 5871815 and they communicated with each other
5871883 5874102 via headphones and a microphone.
5874202 5876614 <i>Okay, here we go. Attack.</i>
5884312 5885837 <i>Bring it out now!</i>
5885947 5886994 <i>Bring it out!</i>
5887632 5890215 <i>Okay, attack!<br />Attack!</i>
5895540 5897474 <i>Okay, bring it back and bring it in again.</i>
5897542 5899692 <i>Bring it back and then bring it in.</i>
5906401 5907641 <i>Yeah, bring it out!</i>
5907769 5909009 <i>Bring it out!</i>
5910138 5911333 <i>Now bring it in.</i>
5911439 5912770 <i>Bring it in again.</i>
5913257 5917569 <i>Now, cut!<br />Once again, right</i> away.
5917662 5919505 <i>Yeah, next time. Okay?</i>
5921983 5924293 Good grief.<br />Am I in trouble with <i>Jaws?</i>
5925036 5926504 In Jaws trouble?
5926571 5929131 Verna was great. We used to call her…
5929207 5932518 Our affectionate nickname for<br />Verna Fields was "Mother Cutter"
5932627 5936530 because she was like our<br />mom and she cooked for us,
5936681 5939992 and she told us great<br />stories of Peter Bogdanovich
5940101 5942320 and all the films that she cut with him.
5942437 5943848 She was just a great person.
5943921 5945855 She was a very charismatic person.
5945923 5949700 She was the most charismatic<br />person on Jaws, her and Robert Shaw.
5949811 5951427 Except she never came out to sea.
5951496 5953055 She was always in her cutting room.
5953181 5955866 It was frustrating for<br />Verna, for two reasons.
5955967 5958334 One, she never had enough film to cut.
5958453 5960865 Because on a good day, I get five shots.
5960938 5963032 On a good day at sea, five shots.
5963307 5966504 On an average day, about<br />three. On a bad day, none.
5967345 5971077 Verna didn't have a lot of film racing<br />into her cutting room to put together,
5971199 5973543 so she had to be on the<br />island for seven months,
5973618 5974995 with very little to cut.
5975086 5977771 <i>Verna didn't have the film<br />until we finished the movie.</i>
5977872 5979522 <i>That's when Verna's work got started.</i>
5979607 5982292 <i>Verna and I worked every day<br />on the picture at her house,</i>
5982360 5987207 <i>in her little cutting room by<br />the pool, and she did a great job.</i>
5989000 5990115 What am I looking for?
5990218 5994337 We're looking for a nice place to<br />show that Quint refuses to slow the boat.
6003498 6005910 <i>Quint, it can't take that much pressure!</i>
6008286 6009651 That's the spot, Steve.
6009971 6013748 I had always wanted to be in<br />business with John Williams, all my life.
6014292 6017341 When he said yes to Sugar<br />land, and we became friends…
6018129 6020120 Obviously, I wanted him to<br />do every picture I ever made,
6020248 6022228 and Jaws came second.
6022300 6025600 When John saw the movie,<br />he called me up on the phone.
6025670 6027934 He said, "This is like a pirate movie."
6028005 6030565 And he said, "I think we<br />need pirate music for this
6030658 6033969 "because this is primal, but<br />it's also fun and entertaining."
6034045 6036889 This idea of characterizing<br />the shark musically,
6036998 6040684 these low, thumping<br />ostinato notes in the bass,
6041736 6044467 were the result of a very<br />simple idea that I had.
6044572 6048691 I thought that the shark<br />should be represented
6048793 6050989 by something in sound or in music,
6051062 6055056 probably music, because there's no<br />sound underneath the water, we thought.
6055550 6057427 Today you might do it with sound effects.
6057501 6060277 I thought a driving thing in<br />the bottom of the orchestra
6060388 6065235 might indicate the<br />mindless attack of the shark.
6065326 6068921 It's all instinct. There's no<br />real intelligence behind it.
6069931 6071558 It's an unstoppable…
6072817 6077414 This thing comes at you. You<br />can't fight it off without destroying it
6077888 6080664 because of this<br />relentless drive that it has.
6080825 6084659 When he finally played the<br />music for me on the piano,
6084729 6087198 he previewed the main Jaws theme.
6087531 6091195 I expected to hear something<br />kind of weird and melodic,
6092320 6096052 kind of tonal, but eerie<br />and of another world,
6096157 6098842 almost a bit like outer space,
6098960 6100735 inner space under the water.
6101545 6103206 And what he played me instead,
6103281 6105545 with two fingers on the lower keys, was…
6108603 6110947 At first I began to laugh.<br />I thought he was…
6111022 6113866 He had a great sense of humor.<br />I thought he was putting me on.
6113975 6116558 And he said, "No, that's<br />the theme to Jaws!"
6117228 6119754 I said, "Play it again."<br />He played it again.
6120231 6124145 And he played it again,<br />and it suddenly seemed right.
6124235 6126397 But when I first heard it, it seemed wrong
6126470 6129986 because it just seemed too simple.
6130574 6135239 And so simple… Often the<br />best ideas are the simplest ones.
6135780 6139614 And John found a signature<br />for the entire movie.
6139684 6143086 One could alter<br />the speed of this ostinato.
6143154 6145566 It could be note, note,
6145673 6148802 any kind of alteration<br />of speed, to very slow,
6148893 6151635 very fast, very soft, very loud.
6151896 6155958 All these things could<br />manipulate the moment
6156384 6159115 to illustrate that the shark was
6159954 6163800 at the highest pitch of<br />frenzy, or something lower.
6164442 6168174 And this simple dramatic device<br />seemed to be what we needed.
6207284 6208945 <i>Part of the genius of John Williams</i>
6209019 6213217 is how he spots music and<br />how he places music in a movie.
6213374 6215854 That's sort of something
6215960 6218861 that's never discussed<br />about the art of composition.
6219497 6221659 The placement of that composition.
6222333 6226816 And John did not want music<br />to celebrate a red herring.
6227138 6230597 He only wanted music to signal<br />the actual arrival of the shark.
6234612 6239413 <i>There were opportunities<br />to advertise the shark with music,</i>
6239784 6242264 <i>and also opportunities<br />when we don't have the music</i>
6242353 6244947 <i>and the audience has<br />the sense of an absence.</i>
6247508 6250626 They sense the absence of the<br />shark. They don't hear the thump.
6250694 6252788 We've conditioned them to do that.
6257752 6259527 <i>But then you may go one step further.</i>
6259603 6261753 <i>We know now the shark really is there,</i>
6261856 6263574 <i>but we haven't advertised it with music,</i>
6263641 6265803 <i>so his attack comes out of silence.</i>
6267128 6270029 <i>Now, because you're conditioned<br />to have the music every time,</i>
6270131 6273647 <i>when you don't and the shark<br />arrives, it's even more terrifying.</i>
6274552 6276850 It's one of the beauties<br />of the film medium
6276921 6280221 that when you combine music<br />with this kind of visual thing,
6280291 6282988 you can get this association<br />in people's minds.
6283093 6286358 I think if you did it musically<br />just in a concert piece,
6286464 6288193 it wouldn't have the same effect.
6288265 6292224 It's the combination of<br />the visual and the situation.
6292303 6296149 This being the shark, or the<br />knifing scene in Hitchcock's Psycho,
6296307 6297502 combined with the notes.
6297575 6302308 That combination of sound and image
6302563 6304190 forming a memory,
6304415 6308579 which can then be referred back to.
6308936 6311098 As you do with an<br />audience that now hears it,
6311205 6313003 and a child will scream in terror
6313107 6316589 because of the association<br />that's been created.
6316660 6318321 Ho open where are you?
6320848 6323966 <i>My favorite cue in</i> Jaws<br /><i>has always been that barrel chase,</i>
6324034 6327595 <i>where the shark approaches the<br />boat and they harpoon the animal</i>
6327671 6332404 <i>and he takes the line out<br />and the barrels lift off the boat</i>
6332510 6335411 <i>and the music accelerates<br />and becomes very exciting.</i>
6336146 6337307 <i>Show.</i>
6340317 6341409 Time.
6343153 6344735 What were you doing? You knew I had
6344839 6347137 to get a clean shot right in the head.
6347241 6350723 All right, let's see how long<br />that barrel takes to bring him up.
6350794 6354981 The boat turns to follow the<br />shark as he's pulling the line out,
6355065 6356624 and the music becomes very heroic.
6356700 6361103 There's a Korngoldian<br />fanfare, if you like, of triumph
6361171 6364618 as they're going through<br />the waves chasing the shark.
6365626 6368812 Bring another barrel!<br />I'm coming around again!
6385362 6387387 <i>Suddenly the shark dives down.</i>
6387464 6391560 <i>The music deflates and gets<br />slower and slower and softer.</i>
6395839 6398820 <i>The deflation and<br />disappointment of the realization</i>
6398926 6401111 <i>that the shark hasn't been captured.</i>
6401562 6406216 It's all illustrated in this<br />one area where the music
6406750 6410778 is able to follow all that<br />dramatic outline and punctuate it.
6410905 6412737 Without that score,
6412840 6415434 I believe the film would have<br />only been half as successful.
6415526 6418962 The score was clearly responsible<br />for half the success of that movie.
6419046 6423791 <i>Jaws</i> certainly was a hallmark in<br />my career. It changed it very greatly.
6423867 6425062 I had done
6425135 6428070 I don't know how many films,<br />dozens, before that,
6428138 6430288 and certainly hundreds<br />of television shows.
6430391 6433406 As a matter of fact, I'd even won<br />an Academy Award before Jaws
6433510 6436172 <i>for having been</i> music<br /><i>director of Fiddler on the Roof,</i>
6436246 6439511 for which I did all the<br />arrangements and underscoring
6439617 6443611 and conducting of that<br />movie in 1970, I think it was.
6445356 6450066 Jaws, for me, was the first Academy<br />Award that I received for my own music.
6451245 6455091 So that was a very significant<br />moment in my career,
6455165 6457247 as it would be for anyone's.
6457368 6459894 The first test of Jaws took place,
6460437 6464101 as I wrote in my own book,<br />in Dallas in a shopping center.
6466894 6469989 Dick Zanuck and I were extremely nervous.
6470364 6472446 Would the shark get laughs?
6472816 6476650 Everybody knew that had read a<br />newspaper, that it was not a real shark.
6477104 6478697 What would happen?
6478806 6482458 And I remember circling<br />around that theater,
6483293 6484920 and we noticed a crowd.
6485195 6489177 Of course we weren't very subtle<br />with what was put on the marquee.
6489283 6491866 It was like, "The biggest<br />fish story you'll ever see,"
6491935 6495280 or something very clever<br />that attracted attention.
6495389 6497403 After all, Jaws was<br />a number one bestseller
6497474 6499408 and had a lot of media attention.
6499476 6502923 And so we went and had a very stiff drink.
6503847 6505656 We went into the theater,
6505949 6508680 and the screams started,<br />and they never stopped.
6509136 6512049 And we were pinching<br />each other. It was incredible.
6512256 6516215 I thought the whole roof,
6516326 6519307 ceiling of the theater<br />was going to collapse
6519413 6523600 because of the noise, the<br />shock and the screams so loud.
6524418 6526580 And it didn't die down, so that we…
6526687 6531124 You couldn't, literally, hear the dialogue
6531225 6534786 for the next, maybe minute<br />because there was…
6534878 6537506 People were screaming repeatedly.
6538165 6541066 And there was such<br />excitement in the theater.
6541335 6545920 I remember elbowing Mr. Brown,<br />who was sitting next to me,
6547458 6550974 and he was elbowing me back,<br />and said, "We're in. We did it."
6551345 6555088 We knew with that first<br />scream that it had worked.
6555182 6557344 When the shark came out of the water,
6557451 6559351 when Roy Scheider was chumming and said,
6559453 6562036 "Why don't you come down<br />and chum some of this shit?"
6562106 6563619 The shark comes out.
6563724 6567354 I had designed, hopefully, a<br />laugh that would turn into a scream.
6567461 6569839 So I used the word "shit."<br />I added that line
6569913 6572257 because in those days, back in 1974,
6572366 6573629 the word "shit" was an easy laugh.
6573734 6575543 Now it's used so much<br />nobody laughs anymore.
6575652 6577416 Then it wasn't used that much.
6577488 6579707 It instantly got a nervous<br />laugh from audiences,
6579807 6583641 often an embarrassed laugh. With<br />younger people, a rebellious laugh.
6584111 6586489 I was trying to change a laugh,
6586563 6588907 ramping up into a scream.<br />And it worked.
6589016 6591644 It was my proudest moment<br />at the whole preview.
6591752 6593652 They laughed when they heard "shit,"
6593754 6596530 and when the shark came out<br />that laugh sustained itself
6596607 6599292 into a humongous scream,<br />and popcorn went flying.
6599393 6603193 It was amazing, and it made<br />me greedy. I got so greedy.
6603397 6605388 Because earlier in the movie,
6605933 6609051 when they find Ben<br />Gardner's head in the boat,
6609319 6612550 I hadn't timed it right,<br />and Richard turns around…
6612623 6614364 That's where the head's already there,
6614475 6616842 and there was no reaction<br />from the audience at all.
6616944 6619208 So I was scratching my head<br />after the preview.
6619313 6620997 I was extraordinarily happy.
6621064 6624159 The numbers were the highest<br />numbers in Universal's history,
6624251 6626413 the executives were happy, we were happy,
6626520 6628010 the audience loved the picture.
6628122 6629203 And I was greedy.
6629273 6632265 I said, "There's one more<br />scream we can get into this movie
6632342 6635528 "if I can figure out this thing<br />with Ben Gardner's head."
6636230 6639382 The studio wouldn't give me more<br />money, though they were ecstatic.
6639449 6643158 They said, "It's fine. Don't fix<br />something that's not broken. It works.
6643270 6646388 "Don't mess with it, or you'll<br />improve this into a failure."
6646456 6649016 So I went and spent $3,000 of my own money
6649193 6651605 to have some art department people
6651712 6654613 build a balsa-wood side of a boat
6655098 6657442 to match the Ben Gardner<br />boat we had shot before,
6657551 6661351 cut a hole in it and got the<br />same Ben Gardner head,
6661471 6664372 the Styrofoam head, latex and Styrofoam,
6664474 6665987 and had it underwater.
6666093 6669620 And this time, simply, when the<br />double for Rick came to the hole,
6669730 6672461 I used several timings, I shot<br />it about nine different ways.
6672566 6673943 One time I shot it,
6674017 6676827 he comes through the hole<br />and the head comes out.
6677104 6678515 Another time,
6678589 6681058 he comes through the hole and<br />the head comes out at the same time.
6681124 6684651 Another time, the head comes<br />out and he's not even in the shot.
6684761 6687105 Then the camera goes<br />really close to the knife,
6687214 6689273 taking the tooth out,<br />the head comes out there.
6689383 6691750 I did it a whole bunch of different ways,
6691852 6694184 and then I went to the dubbing room.
6694288 6697770 We were already remixing<br />little changes we had made.
6698325 6700384 And I cut it in and I tried it out
6700494 6702553 on all of the sound effects editors,
6702663 6704757 the music editors and the dubbers.
6704865 6706765 And I showed them one way, and they said,
6706867 6708858 "Interesting. It's better<br />than what you had."
6708969 6710960 Another way, no reaction.
6711205 6713765 And then one way, nobody screamed,
6713874 6715501 but they all kind of suddenly said,
6715609 6718670 "Oh, yeah. Wow. That<br />surprised me. I didn't expect it."
6719429 6721147 It was simply a matter of timing.
6721248 6722875 And the moment that works the best,
6722983 6725896 which is the moment in the<br />movie that the dubbers reacted to,
6725986 6728830 is the moment where he gets to the hole,
6729640 6732883 and then the head comes out.<br />There's just a bit of a pause.
6742069 6745630 And I just remember we then<br />took the film to Long Beach.
6746123 6748535 I think at the Lakewood Theaters.
6749243 6750711 And we had a second preview there
6750811 6753496 with that extra scene,<br />that extra moment in.
6753814 6756442 And it got a humongous scream.
6756867 6760667 Bigger than the scream in Dallas when<br />the shark came out, with Roy chumming.
6760737 6762501 And popcorn flew even higher,
6762572 6764449 and people came out of their seats higher.
6764558 6767255 And I was thrilled until at Lakewood,
6767561 6770826 we got to the scene that<br />got the previous big laugh,
6771098 6773897 where the shark comes out of<br />the water when Roy's chumming.
6774001 6777369 It got a big scream, but it was only 50%
6777938 6780316 or less of the scream we got in Dallas.
6780407 6782569 So that preview was a smash preview.
6782676 6786112 The scores were higher, the<br />studio was flying on cloud nine.
6786213 6788910 They'll make a fortune with<br />the movie, they keep saying.
6789016 6790848 And I'm scratching my head thinking,
6790951 6793852 "Now what did I do to make<br />that second scream less?"
6793954 6796139 And I realized it was a no-brainer.
6796690 6801184 The audience didn't trust me after the<br />first scream at the end of the first act.
6801295 6804026 They were surprised, and<br />then they were looking out
6804131 6806975 for shadows and things<br />coming out from behind things.
6807067 6811504 And they were defensive and<br />ready for some kind of a shock.
6812456 6816916 The rating of Jaws was a real cliffhanger.
6818045 6821140 Richard Heffner, the<br />chairman of the rating board
6821248 6823683 of the Motion Picture<br />Association of America
6823784 6827152 that tells parents<br />what to expect on movies…
6828322 6832884 It was essential to the MCA/Universal<br />financiers and distributors
6833260 6836161 that Jaws get a "PG" rating,
6836263 6839164 meaning "parental guidance indicated,"
6839266 6841633 but it meant that children<br />could come and see it.
6841735 6845478 Whatever the ratings board said<br />to Sheinberg and Wasserman,
6846289 6849441 they told Dick and David, who<br />came to me as my producers
6849543 6853639 and said, "Steven, in order to get<br />not an 'R' rating, but a 'PG' rating,
6853864 6857346 "you need to cut some frames<br />from the leg coming down."
6857451 6860352 I was happy to do it, as they<br />didn't ask me to cut the leg out.
6860454 6865016 They just asked me not to let the<br />leg hit, bounce, gush blood, settle…
6865208 6867188 Because I was really sort of studying it.
6867294 6870264 So I cut about a foot and a<br />half to two feet off that shot.
6870364 6872992 <i>You'll see the leg.<br />Just when you see it severed</i>
6873100 6875899 <i>and it just starts to hit<br />the silt bed, we cut</i> away.
6875986 6880401 And finally, a "PG" was awarded.
6881375 6885619 Our argument was very simple<br />with Heffner and his board.
6886630 6890897 Nobody impersonates a shark,<br />unlike films of violence.
6891168 6894001 No one is going to get up<br />and eat somebody.
6894121 6896556 Nobody's going to drag<br />someone down in the water.
6896640 6901294 What happens in nature is<br />part of childhood's experience.
6901395 6905127 <i>Anyone</i> who's read <i>Grimm's<br />Fairy Tales… Red Riding Hood.</i>
6905232 6908964 <i>Little Red Riding Hood is one</i> of<br /><i>the scariest stories ever written,</i>
6910337 6913534 and children are regularly terrified.
6914074 6916338 After the film was distributed,
6916877 6921246 I don't recall any letters from children…
6921348 6923783 About children having bad dreams.
6924151 6926779 I had many about adults having bad dreams
6926887 6929083 and never going by the water again.
6929306 6933243 And so the rating, to the<br />great relief of MCA/Universal,
6933310 6937156 was, in my estimation, rightly<br />given "parental guidance."
6937264 6941724 "May be too intense for<br />some children" was on the ads.
6942536 6945050 Of course, all that did was bring them in.
6945288 6948531 I saw the film in its final version
6948959 6951690 when it played at the<br />Rivoli Theater in Manhattan,
6951812 6954895 which was a huge theater<br />with a great big screen.
6954965 6959334 And members of my family<br />and guests were invited.
6963607 6967817 Watching the audience react<br />to it was wonderfully exciting.
6967928 6970454 I mean, they just laughed<br />and they screamed.
6970831 6973277 They did everything<br />that we hoped they would do.
6973350 6976559 I happened, by coincidence, to be<br />next to the Newsweek researcher,
6976670 6978297 who was next to the Time researcher.
6978405 6981887 At the moment when Roy turns aft
6981958 6983619 and the shark comes out of the water,
6983727 6986207 and he utters that great<br />line that I wish I'd written,
6986313 6988554 "I think you're gonna need a bigger boat,"
6988632 6990930 <i>the Newsweek researcher<br />jumped out</i> of <i>her</i> chair
6991001 6994483 and landed on the upturned<br />pen of the Time researcher,
6994588 6997102 thus having a double screamer going.
6997541 6999475 I thought right then,
6999543 7002103 "We have a fairly successful<br />movie going on here."
7002429 7005012 There was applause at<br />the end of the movie.
7005382 7008010 The movie ends, we're<br />swimming away, it says "The End,"
7008118 7011110 and they went crackers.<br />Everyone went berserk.
7012189 7014317 However many people are in that theater…
7014391 7017509 I couldn't even tell you.<br />Pretty big theater.
7017611 7019124 They went nuts.
7021831 7025881 And then they sat and they<br />watched all of the credits,
7026570 7029915 every last one of them, and nobody moved.
7031258 7033886 And then they applauded again.
7033994 7035359 And I've never seen that.
7035679 7039411 And I remember walking out<br />on the sidewalk at the end of it.
7039683 7042243 I looked at Dreyfuss and he looked at me,
7042319 7046369 and he ran over and<br />he jumped up in my arms
7046907 7050787 and he said, "We're sensational!
7050860 7052624 "We're great!<br />We're terrific!"
7052696 7054255 And I said, "Yeah."
7054331 7058700 At the end of that evening I walked<br />out and I ran into Dreyfuss in the street,
7058802 7060429 and we went to a bar,
7060503 7065168 and all Rick could say was, "He did it!"
7065859 7068874 And I said, "Who did it?<br />What are you talking about?"
7068979 7070811 He said, "Spielberg<br />did it! He did it!"
7070931 7072660 It was a hell of a moment.
7072766 7076350 I felt so proud that I was in that movie,
7076720 7078814 and so proud for Spielberg.
7080790 7083942 I remember getting on<br />the phone with notes.
7084044 7088038 I was saying, "And you gotta<br />do this and you gotta do that."
7090166 7091634 He was very pleased.
7092319 7096313 Well, Jaws went on to become
7097057 7100368 the biggest picture of<br />all times at that time,
7101478 7104573 surpassing the $100 million mark,
7104648 7107015 which had never been done before.
7107217 7110960 And I remember Universal<br />marketing department
7111755 7113655 would take an ad out
7114024 7117221 with the shark and the titles
7117294 7119979 <i>of the various pictures that had beaten us</i>
7120080 7121491 <i>and held the records.</i>
7121615 7125495 <i>And the shark would<br />devour each one, each week,</i>
7125619 7128236 whether <i>it be</i> The Godfather<br />or The Sound of Music,
7128305 7130399 <i>finally</i> Gone With The Wind.
7130657 7134036 Until we were up on top<br />of the surface, number one,
7134210 7137987 and we became the<br />biggest picture of all time.
7138632 7142318 This was before even a<br />foreign release of any kind.
7142419 7145411 We busted right through<br />the $100 million mark.
7146039 7150317 And it was a phenomenon.<br />It really was a phenomenon.
7150527 7153371 When a movie has the<br />success that Jaws had,
7153596 7156258 it becomes more than an entertainment.
7156333 7159018 It becomes part of the popular culture.
7159169 7160432 And <i>Jaws</i> was no exception.
7160537 7163905 We had really wonderful<br />political cartoonists
7163973 7166499 like Conrad using the image of the shark
7166910 7170028 as a metaphor for political<br />behavior in Washington.
7170130 7172906 <i>We had sketches on Saturday Night Live.</i>
7172982 7176031 Chevy Chase did a great<br />Land Shark. I remember that.
7176136 7179436 And then John Belushi,<br />blessed be his memory,
7179622 7183286 did a fabulous impression of Dreyfuss.
7183360 7186762 You don't think of Belushi and<br />Dreyfuss being anywhere similar,
7186830 7189674 but when Belushi put on a<br />blue knit watch cap and said,
7189783 7193469 "This was no boating accident,"<br />you got a laugh out of it.
7195004 7198941 <i>The first shot of Airplane!</i>
7200643 7203305 By the Zucker brothers uses a shark theme.
7203646 7207640 It was a combination of elements<br />that were all so instantly identifiable
7207751 7209776 because everybody knew what they were.
7209853 7213096 The shark's theme became<br />a synonym for danger.
7215842 7219551 Just all those elements just<br />became part of popular culture.
7220597 7221860 Every time I'd fall asleep,
7221965 7224957 I dreamt I was on the third<br />or fourth day of shooting.
7225301 7228669 I'd wake up with an electrical<br />explosion in my brain.
7229489 7231537 My heart beating, can't catch my breath,
7231608 7234600 looking around the room,<br />where am I? Disoriented.
7234978 7238312 I'd calm down, get a glass of<br />water, go back to sleep again.
7238782 7241308 Same dream. I'm on<br />the fourth day of shooting,
7241418 7246106 and I know I've got another 146 days left.
7246589 7248421 And I'd wake up again.<br />Same thing.
7248508 7252695 And this thing was just haunting me<br />all night long till I didn't get any sleep.
7252796 7257745 So Jaws was a fun movie to<br />watch, but not a fun movie to make.
