1323670 1325062 Got to bring back<br />the tourists
1325106 1327804 that'll put<br />all your businesses<br />on a paying basis.
1328936 1331242 But it's not<br />going to be pleasant.
1331286 1335334 I value my neck<br />a lot more than<br />$3,000, Chief.
1335377 1339381 I'll find him for $3,000,<br />but I'll catch him and<br />kill him for $10,000.
1340208 1342819 You got to<br />make up your minds.
1342863 1345082 Gonna stay alive<br />and ante up,
1345126 1348129 gonna play it cheap<br />and be on welfare<br />the whole winter.
1350044 1352394 I don't want no volunteers.<br />I don't want no mates.
1352438 1355049 There's too many captains<br />on this island.
1355745 1359183 $10,000 for me,<br />by myself.
1359227 1363405 For that,<br />you get the head, the tail,<br />the whole damn thing.
1367801 1369846 Thank you very much,<br />Mr. Quint.
1371326 1373937 We'll take it<br />under advisement.

1423552 1427469 You know, Ellen,<br />people don't even know<br />how old sharks are.
1427513 1430429 I mean, if they live<br />2,000, 3,000 years...<br />They don't know.
1430472 1433127 Enough.
1433170 1434476 You're not going to<br />even be able to go<br />to sleep tonight.
1434520 1436913 Here. Come on.

1450405 1451580 Oh, yeah.
1456150 1458195 Mikey really<br />loves his present.
1459545 1461242 Where is he?
1461285 1462243 Sitting in it.
1465464 1466943 Good God.
1470947 1473036 All right, Michael,<br />out of the boat!
1474255 1477388 Tied up to the jetties,<br />sitting in the boat.
1477432 1479260 I'm helping Michael.
1479303 1480827 Get out of that boat!
1480870 1483351 Hi, Dad. Just a little<br />longer. Please?
1483394 1485092 It's his birthday.
1485135 1486267 I don't want him<br />on the ocean!
1486310 1487964 He's not on the ocean,<br />he is in a boat.
1488008 1489923 He won't go<br />in the water.
1489966 1493622 I don't think he'll<br />go in the water again,<br />after what happened yesterday.
1495363 1498148 All right,<br />now don't say that.
1498192 1500890 I don't want that<br />to happen,<br />you know that.
1502501 1504459 I want him to read<br />the boating regulations,
1504503 1508071 the rules, before he<br />goes out on his own.
1508115 1512162 Michael,<br />did you hear your father?<br />Out of the water now!
1512206 1513207 Now!
1515426 1516906 [DENHERDER WHISTLING]
1520388 1523086 CHARLIE: I'm tired.<br />Let's stop before<br />someone reports us.
1524914 1528396 DENHERDER: Don't worry.<br />The Chief lives on the other<br />side of the island.
1528439 1530877 Am I coming in straight?
1530920 1532095 Don't worry about it.<br />Just keep rowing.
1534881 1536317 [DENHERDER WHISTLING]
1541365 1542584 CHARLIE: We better<br />catch something,
1542628 1544325 this is my wife's<br />holiday roast.
1545413 1546545 DENHERDER:<br />Don't worry about it.
1546588 1548285 $3,000 buys<br />an awful lot of roast.
1548982 1550244 [CHUCKLES]
1556380 1559122 Come and get it.
1563126 1565041 The tide's<br />taking it right out.

1665446 1667448 Charlie,<br />take my word for it,<br />don't look back!
1667491 1669145 Swim, Charlie!
1671757 1675499 Come on! To me, boy!<br />Come on, Charlie! Swim!
1675543 1677719 Come on, Charlie,<br />keep coming.<br />Keep swimming.

1681549 1683203 CHARLIE: I can't get up.
1683246 1684726 Give me your hand,<br />Charlie.
1686249 1688164 CHARLIE: Help me!
1688208 1690079 DENHERDER: Get your feet<br />out of the water!
1703440 1705181 Can we go home now?
1706487 1708141 [CAR HORN HONKING]
1714713 1718194 So then Denherder and Charlie<br />sat there trying to<br />catch their breath
1718238 1720457 and figure out how<br />to tell Charlie's wife
1720501 1722590 what happened to her<br />freezer full of meat.
1722633 1725636 That's not funny.<br />That's not funny at all.

1741696 1743132 Hello.
1743176 1746527 Hello back, young fellow.<br />How are you?
1746570 1749443 Say, I hope<br />you're not going out<br />with those nuts, are you?
1754143 1756189 The Weetock boats<br />gotta move out first.
1756232 1759409 You have to move out<br />or he can't get out<br />at all.
1759453 1762282 Don't raise sail,<br />you're going to luff it.<br />You got a paddle?
1762325 1763805 I got a paddle. Scull it out of here.
1763849 1766373 Officer, wait a second.
1768854 1771247 How many guys<br />are you going to<br />put aboard that boat?
1771291 1772640 Whatever's safe,<br />right?
1772683 1773815 Yeah,<br />well that ain't safe.
1773859 1776122 Watch it,<br />that's dynamite.
1776165 1777688 What are you doing<br />with that?
1777732 1778646 Where are you going<br />with that?
1778689 1780648 I'm going on the boat.
1780691 1783477 Please, help me<br />get those guys out<br />of the boat, will you?
1783520 1785174 Sure. Come on.
1785218 1788438 Gentlemen, the officer<br />asked me to tell you
1788482 1789526 that you're<br />overloading that boat!
1790745 1792486 Go on, get out of here.
1792529 1794444 SKIPPER: You ain't going.<br />What do you care?
1794488 1797839 Can you tell me if there's<br />a good restaurant or hotel<br />on the island?
1797883 1799319 Yeah, you walk<br />straight ahead.

1801190 1804106 They're all<br />going to die.
1804150 1807153 Listen to me.<br />We've got some road<br />block signs outside.
1807196 1809416 You've got to get<br />somebody to help us.
1809459 1812506 Yeah,<br />get those road block signs<br />out on the highway.
1812549 1815857 Because we've got<br />more people down here<br />than we can handle.
1815901 1818860 What're you doing there?<br />These are your people.<br />Go talk to them.
1818904 1820775 They aren't my people.<br />They're from all over.

1826215 1827738 What happened to<br />the extra help...
1827782 1829349 It's not until<br />the Fourth of July.
1829392 1830916 Till then,<br />it's you and me.
1830959 1833309 You know those guys<br />in the fan-tail launch?
1833353 1835616 None of them are getting<br />out of the harbor alive.
1835659 1837444 That's what I'm saying.

1843624 1845931 Could you tell me<br />how I could find<br />Chief Brody?
1845974 1847497 Who are you?
1847541 1850892 Matt Hooper. I'm from<br />the Oceanographic Institute.
1850936 1854200 Oh, for Christ's sakes.<br />You're the guy we called.<br />I'm Brody.
1854243 1856202 Oh. I'm glad<br />to meet you.Me, too.
1856245 1857899 I know you got<br />a lot on your hands.
1857943 1859335 What can we do<br />for you?
1859379 1862251 The best thing to do<br />is to see the remains
1862295 1863731 of the first victim,<br />the girl on the beach.
1863774 1865341 Okay, fine.<br />Just bear with me,<br />will you?
1865385 1866429 Sure.
1868475 1870912 Wait till we get<br />them silly bastards<br />down in that rock pile.
1870956 1872696 There'll be some fun.
1872740 1875221 They'll wish<br />their fathers hadn't<br />met their mothers
1875264 1876875 when they start<br />digging the bottoms out
1876918 1879486 and slamming into<br />them rocks, boy.
1879529 1882402 FISHERMAN 1:<br />Get away from there,<br />you goddamn fool!
1882445 1883794 What's the matter<br />with you?
1883838 1886928 You want to swamp us,<br />you crazy son of a bitch?
1886972 1888930 FISHERMAN 2: What are<br />these guys doing out here?
1890236 1891672 What are they<br />doing back there?
1891715 1892934 They're chumming<br />right now.
1892978 1894370 What the hell<br />is that?

1917002 1918003 And here's the way<br />we have it.
1918046 1920527 "Probable<br />boating accident."
1926620 1928491 The height and weight<br />of the victim
1928535 1931320 can only be estimated<br />from the partial remains.
1932408 1934410 [HOOPER BREATHING HEAVILY]
1936499 1938980 The torso has been<br />severed in mid-thorax.
1939024 1940460 There are no major<br />organs remaining.
1940503 1942375 May I have a glass<br />of water?
1942418 1943637 The right arm<br />has been severed
1943680 1947032 above the elbow<br />with massive tissue loss
1947075 1948729 in the upper musculature.
1949773 1951036 Thank you very much.
1954039 1957042 Partially<br />denuded bone remaining.<br />This was no boat accident.
1957085 1959435 Did you notify<br />the Coast Guard about this?
1959479 1961742 No. It was only<br />local jurisdiction.
1965441 1968967 The left arm, head,<br />the shoulders, sternum
1969010 1970577 and portions of<br />the rib cage are intact.
1970620 1972753 Do not smoke in here.<br />Thank you very much.
1974494 1976365 This is what happens.
1977801 1980891 Indicates<br />the non-frenzy feeding<br />of a large  squalus
1980935 1984547 possibly  longimanus<br />or  Isurus glaucus.
1986419 1989813 The enormous amount<br />of tissue loss prevents<br />any detailed analysis
1989857 1993469 however,<br />the attacking  squalus<br />must be considerably larger
1993513 1995776 than any normal  squalus<br />found in these waters.
1995819 1997821 Didn't you get out a boat<br />and check these waters?
1997865 1999345 No.
1999388 2001477 Well, this is<br />not a boat accident.
2001521 2005307 And it wasn't any propeller.<br />It wasn't any coral reef.
2005351 2007005 And it wasn't<br />Jack the Ripper.
2009964 2011487 It was a shark.

2089043 2090218 How's that?
2097182 2099140 Larry, you won't<br />believe it.
2099184 2100141 What kind of<br />a shark is that?
2100185 2101838 I don't know.
2101882 2103449 I think it's a mako.
2103492 2104885 It's got a deep throat,<br />Frank.
2104928 2106800 Yeah, but what kind?<br />What kind of shark?
2106843 2107801 Tiger shark.
2109803 2111413 A what?
2111457 2112632 We can start<br />breathing again.
2112675 2113894 Is Ben getting<br />plenty of pictures?
2113937 2115417 Oh, you bet he is.
2115461 2116940 What is this<br />bite radius crap?
2116984 2119465 That is a big mouth.
2119508 2120596 You stuff<br />your frigging head<br />in there, man,
2120640 2123251 and find out if<br />it's a man-eater.
2127864 2129997 All I'm saying is<br />that it may not be<br />the shark.
2130040 2131781 It's just a slight...
2131825 2135002 I want you to meet Matt.<br />This is Larry Vaughn,<br />our mayor.
2135045 2136786 Matt's from<br />the Oceanographic Institute.
2136830 2137918 Nice to meet you.
2137961 2139267 Terrific, huh, Mayor?
2141226 2144054 There are all kinds of<br />sharks in the waters.
2144098 2146840 Hammerheads,<br />white tips,<br />blues, makos.
2146883 2149538 And the chances<br />that these bozos<br />got the exact shark...
2149582 2151149 There are no other<br />sharks like this here.
2151192 2154021 It's 100-to-1.
2154064 2158243 I'm not saying that<br />this is not the shark.<br />It probably is, Martin.
2158286 2161202 It's a man-eater.<br />It's extremely rare<br />for these waters.
2161246 2163683 But the fact is,<br />the bite radius<br />on this animal
2163726 2165902 is different<br />than the wounds<br />on the victim.
2167817 2170255 I want to be sure.<br />You want to be sure.
2170298 2171952 We all want to<br />be sure, okay?
2171995 2173997 What I want to do<br />is very simple.
2174041 2176261 The digestive system<br />of this animal<br />is very slow.
2176304 2177958 Let's cut it open.
2178001 2179742 Whatever it's eaten<br />in the last 24 hours
2179786 2181179 is bound to<br />still be in there.
2181222 2183006 And then we'll be sure.
2189230 2191276 It may be the only way<br />to confirm it.
2191319 2194235 Look, fellows,<br />let's be reasonable.
2194279 2196759 This is not<br />the time or the place
2196803 2199936 to perform some kind<br />of a half-assed autopsy<br />on a fish.
2201155 2205203 And I am not<br />going to stand here<br />and see that thing cut open
2205246 2208597 and see that<br />little Kintner boy<br />spill out all over the dock.

2240325 2241978 And you knew it.
2243284 2245721 You knew there was<br />a shark out there.
2248071 2250117 You knew<br />it was dangerous.
2250160 2252728 But you let people<br />go swimming anyway.
2257124 2259300 You knew all those things,
2263086 2265001 but still my boy<br />is dead now.
2269876 2272313 And there's nothing<br />you can do about it.
2278101 2279668 My boy is dead.
2285413 2287328 I wanted you<br />to know that.
2293682 2295075 [MELANCHOLIC INSTRUMENTAL<br />MUSIC PLAYING]
2301168 2303126 I'm sorry, Martin.<br />She's wrong.
2305085 2306391 No, she's not.
2311918 2313136 VAUGHN:<br />All right, fellows
2313180 2315138 let's cut this ugly<br />son of a bitch down
2315182 2317706 before it stinks up<br />the whole island.
2317750 2320796 Harve, you and Carl<br />take it out tomorrow<br />and dump it in the drink.

2397482 2399048 Give us a kiss.
2399092 2400136 Why?
2402965 2404445 Because I need it.
2405315 2406882 [KNOCKING ON DOOR]
2409058 2410451 Get out of here.
2411539 2413062 ELLEN: Can I help you?
2413106 2414412 HOOPER: The door was open.<br />Mind if I come in?
2414455 2416196 I'm Matt Hooper.
2416239 2417893 Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.
2417937 2419460 Your husband's home? Yes.
2419504 2421070 I'd really like<br />to talk to him.
2421114 2422463 Yes, so would I.
2423943 2426032 Come in.<br />Can I get you<br />some coffee?
2426075 2427207 No. Nothing, thank you.
2427250 2428861 Oh, wine. How nice.
2447836 2449272 How was your day?
2450839 2452232 [BOTH LAUGHING]
2455278 2456454 Swell.
2460327 2462503 I got red and white.<br />I didn't know what<br />you'd be serving.
2462547 2464070 Oh, that's nice.
2465419 2467290 Is anyone eating this?
2467334 2468553 No.
2477083 2479520 My husband tells me<br />you're in sharks.
2480478 2482392 [LAUGHS]
2482436 2485265 Excuse me. Yes.<br />I've never heard it<br />quite put that way.
2485308 2486875 But yes, I am.
2487310 2488529 I love sharks.
2488573 2489574 You love sharks?
2489617 2491445 Yeah, I love them.
2491489 2493578 When I was 12 years old,<br />my father got me a boat
2493621 2495536 and I went fishing<br />off of Cape Cod.
2495580 2497843 I hooked a scup and<br />as I was reeling it in
2497886 2500541 I hooked a 4.5 foot<br />baby thresher shark
2500585 2502108 who proceeded<br />to eat my boat.
2504023 2507809 He ate my oar, hooks,<br />and my seat cushions.
2507853 2509158 He turned an inboard<br />into an outboard
2509202 2512422 scared me to death,<br />and I swam back to shore.
2512466 2515251 When I was on the beach,<br />I turned around
2515295 2517297 and actually saw<br />my boat being<br />taken apart.
2517340 2519995 Ever since then,<br />I have been<br />studying sharks
2520039 2523608 and that's why I know<br />that I'm going to go<br />to the Institute tomorrow
2523651 2526262 and tell them<br />that you still have<br />a shark problem here.
2526306 2528177 Why do you have<br />to tell them that? Sorry.
2528221 2529962 I'm sorry,<br />I thought that...
2530005 2531485 You told me<br />the shark was caught.
2531529 2534096 I heard it on the news.<br />I heard it on<br />the Cape station.
2534140 2537186 They caught a shark,<br />not the shark.
2537230 2540015 Not the shark that<br />killed Chrissie Watkins.
2540059 2542888 And probably not the shark<br />that killed the little boy.
2542931 2545543 Which I wanted<br />to prove today by<br />cutting the shark open...
2545586 2548284 You may want to let<br />that breathe... Nothing.
2565258 2568609 You know, you'll be<br />the only rational man
2568653 2570132 left on this island<br />after I leave tomorrow.
2570916 2572308 Where are you going?
2573658 2575877 I am going<br />on the  Aurora.
2575921 2577226 The  Aurora?<br />What is that?
2577270 2580099 It's a floating asylum<br />for shark addicts.
2580142 2582623 It's pure research,<br />18 months at sea.
2582667 2587149 Martin hates boats.<br />Martin hates water.
2587193 2591110 Martin sits in his car<br />when we go on the ferry<br />to the mainland.
2591153 2593286 I guess it's<br />a childhood thing.
2593329 2594940 There's a clinical name<br />for it, isn't there?
2594983 2597377 Drowning.
2597420 2599335 Is it true that most<br />people get attacked
2599379 2601511 by sharks in<br />three feet of water
2601555 2603252 about 10 feet<br />from the beach?
2603296 2605254 Yeah.
2605298 2608693 And that before<br />people started to swim<br />for recreation...
2608736 2612087 I mean, before sharks<br />knew what they were missing
2612131 2615221 that a lot<br />of these attacks<br />weren't reported?
2615264 2616265 That's right.
2618703 2621531 Now this shark<br />that swims alone
2621575 2622489 what's it called? Rogue.
2622532 2624622 Rogue, yeah.
2624665 2627929 This guy,<br />he keeps swimming around
2627973 2629670 in a place where<br />the feeding is good
2629714 2631541 until the food<br />supply is gone, right?
2631585 2633282 That's called<br />territoriality.
2633326 2636242 It's just a theory that<br />I happen to agree with.
2639201 2640681 Then why don't we<br />have one more drink
2640725 2643641 and go down<br />and cut that shark open?
2643684 2646252 Martin?<br />Can you do that?
2650299 2653128 I can do anything.<br />I'm the Chief of Police.
2654564 2655783 [FOGHORN BLOWING]

2694779 2696302 [EXCLAIMS]
2696345 2697303 Just like I thought.
2697346 2698260 What?
2699609 2702482 Came up in the Gulf Stream,<br />from southern waters.
2708227 2709315 He didn't eat a car,<br />did he?
2709358 2711143 No.
2711186 2713754 Tiger shark's<br />like a garbage can.<br />It'll eat anything.
2713798 2716452 Somebody probably<br />threw that in the river.
2716714 2718454 [PANTING]
2722763 2723808 That's it.
2726593 2729204 I've got to<br />close the beach,<br />call the Mayor.
2730336 2732642 You got a bigger<br />problem than that,<br />Martin.
2732686 2735167 You still got a hell<br />of a fish out there
2735210 2736777 with a mouth<br />about this big.
2741651 2744742 How do we confirm that<br />by morning?
2744785 2748702 If he is a rogue,<br />and there's any truth<br />to territoriality at all
2748746 2750399 we got a good chance<br />of spotting him
2750443 2752314 between Cape Scott<br />and South Beach.
2752358 2753533 Where are you going?
2753576 2754752 To find him.<br />He's a night feeder.
2754795 2756231 On the water?
2756275 2757842 We're not gonna<br />find him on the land.
2757885 2758843 I'm not drunk enough<br />to go on a boat.
2758886 2760235 Yes, you are.
2760279 2761759 No, I'm not. Yes, you are.
2761802 2762890 I can't do that. Yes, you can.
2767765 2769244 [BOAT ENGINE WHIRRING]
2772465 2776295 I'm telling you,<br />the crime rate in<br />New York will kill you.
2776338 2780081 There's so many problems,<br />you never feel like you're<br />accomplishing anything.
2780125 2783302 Violence,<br />rip-offs, muggings.
2783345 2784433 The kids can't<br />leave the house.
2784477 2786609 You've got to<br />walk them to school.
2786653 2790265 But in Amity,<br />one man can<br />make a difference.
2790309 2792398 In 25 years,<br />there's never been
2792441 2793834 a shooting or a murder<br />in this town.
2794922 2797272 No kidding?<br />Want a pretzel?
2797882 2799535 Where are we?
2799579 2802321 We're right in the stretch<br />where he's been feeding.
2805193 2807152 Can you get<br />The Late Show<br />on this thing?
2807195 2808631 No, it's a closed<br />circuit TV system.
2808675 2810851 I have underwater<br />cameras fore-and-aft.
2811765 2813462 Who pays<br />for all this stuff?
2813506 2815116 The government?<br />The Institute?
2815160 2816857 This stuff costs<br />a lot of money.
2818728 2821122 I paid for this<br />mostly myself, actually.
2821166 2822558 You're kidding. No.
2823646 2824952 You rich? Yeah.
2825779 2827346 How much?
2827389 2828651 Personally,<br />or the whole family?
2830697 2835223 Doesn't make any sense.<br />They pay a guy like you<br />to watch sharks?
2835267 2838574 Well, it doesn't<br />make sense for a guy
2838618 2840881 who hates the water to<br />live on an island either.
2840925 2844232 It's only an island<br />if you look at it<br />from the water.
2844276 2845668 That makes<br />a lot of sense.
2851936 2853459 BRODY: What is<br />that thing doing?
2854895 2857332 Well, it's a fish finder.
2857376 2859204 It's probably just<br />a school of mackerel<br />or something,
2859247 2861380 all clumped together.
2861423 2863251 [RADAR BEEPING]
2863730 2865297 Wait a minute.
2869910 2871564 There's something else<br />out there.

2926706 2929274 Martin, I gotta go down<br />and check their hull.

3067890 3070110 This is a great white,<br />Larry. A big one.
3070154 3073070 Any shark expert<br />will tell you it's<br />a killer, a man-eater.
3073113 3075898 The situation is<br />that apparently<br />a great white shark
3075942 3078423 has staked a claim<br />in the waters<br />off Amity Island.
3078466 3081556 He'll continue to feed here<br />as long as there's food<br />in the water.
3081600 3083167 There's no limit<br />to what he'll do.
3083210 3084907 We've had<br />three incidents.
3084951 3087127 Two people<br />killed within a week.<br />It'll happen again.
3087171 3089521 It happened before.<br />The Jersey beach, 1916.
3089564 3091131 Five people<br />were killed... In one week.
3091175 3092915 Tell him<br />about the swimmers.
3092959 3096136 A shark is attracted<br />to the exact kind of<br />splashing and activity
3096180 3099139 that occurs<br />whenever human beings swim.<br />You can't avoid it.
3099183 3102751 Opening the beaches on<br />the Fourth of July is like<br />ringing the dinner bell.
3102795 3104449 Look, Mr. Vaughn
3104492 3107016 I pulled a tooth<br />the size of a shot glass
3107060 3108627 out of the wrecked hull<br />of a boat out there.
3108670 3110455 It was the tooth<br />of a great white.
3110498 3111978 It was Gardner's boat,<br />all chewed up.
3112021 3114459 I helped tow it in.<br />You should've seen it!
3114502 3117766 Where is that tooth?<br />Did you see it, Brody?
3117810 3118941 I didn't see it.<br />He dropped it<br />on the way in.
3118985 3121596 I had an accident.
3121640 3124251 And what did<br />you say the name<br />of this shark is?
3125905 3128908 It's a  Carcharodon carcharias.<br />It's a great white.
3128951 3130736 You don't<br />have the tooth?
3132607 3135175 Look, we depend on<br />the summer people<br />for our very lives...
3135219 3138613 You won't have a summer<br />unless you deal<br />with this problem!
3138657 3141486 We have to close the beach<br />and hire someone<br />to kill the shark!
3141529 3143618 We have to tell<br />the Coast Guard.
3143662 3146578 You'll have to contact<br />the Shark Research Panel.
3146621 3148797 You'll have to ring<br />this entire harbor!
3148841 3150625 I don't think<br />either one of you
3150669 3152627 are familiar<br />with our problems!
3152671 3154673 I think that<br />I am familiar<br />with the fact
3154716 3156979 that you'll ignore<br />this particular problem
3157023 3159678 until it swims up and<br />bites you in the ass!
3159721 3162637 Wait a second!<br />There are two ways<br />to deal with this problem!
3162681 3165814 You either kill this animal<br />or cut off its food supply.
3165858 3167555 BRODY: We have to<br />close the beaches.
3167599 3168643 Brody?
3169166 3171820 Sick vandalism.
3171864 3175955 That is<br />a deliberate mutilation<br />of a public service message.
3175998 3178827 I want those little<br />paint-happy bastards<br />caught
3178871 3180829 and hung up by<br />their Buster Browns.
3180873 3183832 That's it.<br />I won't waste my time<br />arguing with a man
3183876 3185051 who's lining up<br />to be a hot lunch.
3185094 3186270 I'm gonna see<br />you later, Brody.
3186313 3188272 Don't do this.<br />He's not...
3195583 3199805 What we are dealing with here<br />is a perfect engine,<br />an eating machine.
3200632 3202503 It's really<br />a miracle of evolution.
3202547 3206551 All this machine does<br />is swim and eat
3206594 3209249 and make little sharks.<br />And that's all.
3209293 3212034 Why don't you take<br />a long, close look<br />at this sign?
3212078 3214298 Those proportions<br />are correct.
3214341 3215690 You'd love to prove that,<br />wouldn't you?

3231924 3233752 we might be able<br />to save August.

3243805 3246068 do whatever you have to,<br />to make them safe.

4604469 4605644 I got it!
4605688 4607428 [REEL SPINNING LOUDLY]
4607472 4609213 What? Get behind me.
4612695 4614348 Hooper, reverse her!
4615480 4617613 Taking a hell<br />of a lot of line!
4617656 4620746 Chief, get the scoop<br />out of the bucket!<br />Wet the reel!
4624707 4626665 Hooper, reverse her!
4630713 4634412 Duck your head down.<br />We're swinging.<br />Get behind me again.
4634455 4638111 No more water.<br />I don't want you<br />to drown me.
4638155 4641114 Hooper,<br />you idiot, starboard!<br />Ain't you watching it!
4645292 4646424 Hooper, neutral.
4654040 4655694 Where'd he go now?
4656608 4658262 He ain't fooling me.
4659524 4661395 What's he yanking on now?
4662440 4663789 Go on, try it.
4676759 4679457 I don't know, Chief,<br />if he's very smart<br />or very dumb.
4686551 4687726 Jesus...
4691556 4693601 He's gone under.
4693645 4696822 He's gone under the boat.<br />I think he's gone<br />under the boat.
4697780 4699607 Yeah, it's too easy.
4699651 4703481 He is a smart, big fish.<br />He's gone under the boat.
4703524 4706614 Keep her steady, now.<br />I got something very big!
4706658 4708094 I don't think so.
4709400 4712055 Chief, put your gloves on.
4712098 4714318 You put your gloves on,<br />both of you!
4717234 4719105 Getting ready<br />to run out again.
4719802 4721804 Quint, let it go.
4721847 4724545 Maybe you're a big yahoo<br />in the lab,
4724589 4726112 but out here<br />you're just supercargo!
4726156 4728767 If you don't want<br />to backstroke home,<br />you get down here!
4728811 4731552 You don't want<br />to listen to me,<br />don't listen to me.
4731596 4732728 It's not a shark.
4732771 4734817 The wire's showing.
4734860 4736340 Unbuckle me.
4737428 4739125 Get the other side.
4739169 4740474 It's a tuna<br />or swordfish
4741432 4742868 wasting our time.
4743651 4745392 Take this rod.
4745436 4746785 Hooper, give the Chief<br />a hand, will you?
4746829 4748221 Right!
4748265 4749222 Oh, shit!
4759624 4762148 It may be a marlin<br />or a stingray
4762845 4764803 but it's definitely<br />a game fish.
4776641 4779252 Gaming fish?
4779296 4782386 Marlin, stingray bit<br />through this piano wire?
4782429 4784257 Don't you tell me<br />my business again.
4784301 4785432 You get back<br />on the bridge.
4785476 4788261 Quint, that doesn't<br />prove a damn thing.
4788305 4790437 It proves one thing,<br />Mr. Hooper.
4790481 4793527 You wealthy<br />college boys don't have<br />the education enough
4793571 4795181 to admit<br />if you're wrong.

4819510 4820859 Aye-aye, sir!
4823514 4826822 You see, what I do,<br />Chief, is I trick them<br />to the surface.
4826865 4829302 And then<br />I jab at them.
4829346 4832610 I'm not going<br />to haul them up<br />like a lot of catfish.
4832653 4834438 Hooper, full throttle!

5393170 5394432 What is it?
5399916 5402788 Mr. Hooper, that's<br />the  U.S.S. Indianapolis.
5410492 5412319 You were<br />on the  Indianapolis?
5412363 5413538 What happened?
5416149 5419805 Japanese submarine<br />slammed two torpedoes<br />into her side, Chief.
5421372 5425202 I was coming back<br />from the island<br />of Tinian to Leyte
5425245 5428074 just delivered the bomb,<br />the Hiroshima bomb.
5431469 5434341 1,100 men went<br />into the water.
5434385 5435995 Vessel went down<br />in 12 minutes.
5438824 5441436 Didn't see the first shark<br />for about half an hour.
5441479 5444003 Tiger, 13-footer.
5444047 5446919 You know how you know that<br />when you're in the water,<br />Chief?
5446963 5449835 You tell by looking<br />from the dorsal<br />to the tail.
5451402 5453883 Well, we didn't know.
5453926 5456581 Because our bomb mission<br />had been so secret
5457800 5459932 no distress signal<br />had been sent.
5461064 5462152 [CHUCKLES]
5466939 5469507 They didn't even list us<br />overdue for a week.
5471204 5475208 Very first light,<br />sharks come cruising
5475252 5477994 so we formed ourselves<br />into tight groups.
5479038 5481954 You know, kind of<br />like old squares
5481998 5483869 in a battle like<br />you see on a calendar
5483913 5486481 like the Battle<br />of Waterloo.<br />The idea was...
5486524 5488265 the shark comes<br />to the nearest man
5488308 5491094 and he starts pounding,<br />hollering and screaming.
5491137 5493488 Sometimes the shark<br />would go away...
5494619 5497143 but sometimes<br />he wouldn't go away.
5497187 5501234 Sometimes that shark,<br />he looks right into you,<br />right into your eyes.
5501278 5502540 [SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING]
5502584 5505848 You know, a thing<br />about a shark, he's got...
5505891 5509242 lifeless eyes.<br />Black eyes,<br />like a doll's eyes.
5511331 5515292 When he comes at you,<br />he doesn't seem to<br />be living
5515335 5519644 until he bites you.<br />Those black eyes roll<br />over white and then...
5521559 5524649 Then you hear<br />that terrible<br />high-pitched screaming.
5525345 5528044 The ocean turns red.
5528087 5531264 In spite of the pounding<br />and the hollering,<br />they all come in.
5533310 5535268 They rip you<br />to pieces.
5535312 5537183 [GRAVE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING]
5540099 5542580 You know,<br />by the end of<br />that first dawn...
5543668 5545278 we lost 100 men.
5547237 5550022 I don't know<br />how many sharks.<br />Maybe 1,000.
5550066 5553504 I don't know how many men,<br />they averaged six an hour.
5553548 5556507 On Thursday morning,<br />I bumped into a friend<br />of mine...
5556551 5558640 Herbie Robinson,<br />from Cleveland.
5560076 5562557 Baseball player,<br />bosun's mate.
5565081 5568606 I thought he was asleep.<br />Reached over to wake him up.
5570652 5574133 He bobbed up and down<br />in the water just<br />like a kind of top.
5574699 5576135 Upended.
5580357 5582707 He'd been bitten in half,<br />below the waist.
5587059 5591324 Noon the fifth day,<br />a Lockheed Ventura saw us.
5591368 5594240 He swung in low<br />and he saw us.<br />He was a young pilot.
5594284 5595764 Younger than Mr. Hooper.
5595807 5598462 He saw us<br />and he came in low,<br />and three hours later...
5598505 5602074 a big fat PBY comes down<br />and starts to pick us up.
5602118 5604642 That was the time<br />I was most frightened.
5605469 5607166 Waiting for my turn.
5608733 5611257 I'll never put on<br />a life jacket again.
5613216 5615348 So, 1,100 men went<br />into the water
5616349 5618351 316 men come out.
5618395 5622181 The sharks took the rest,<br />June 29, 1945.
5625271 5628753 Anyway,<br />we delivered the bomb.
