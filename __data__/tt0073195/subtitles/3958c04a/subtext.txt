1280614 1283700 that'll put<br />all your businesses<br />on a paying basis.
1284534 1286787 But it's not<br />going to be pleasant.
1286870 1290040 I value my neck<br />a lot more than<br />$3,000, Chief.
1290874 1295378 I'll find him for $3,000,<br />but I'll catch him and<br />kill him for $10,000.
1296004 1298006 You got to<br />make up your minds.
1298548 1300550 Gonna stay alive<br />and ante up,
1300634 1304221 gonna play it cheap<br />and be on welfare<br />the whole winter.
1305722 1308058 I don't want no volunteers.<br />I don't want no mates.
1308183 1311061 There's too many captains<br />on this island.

1314731 1319402 For that,<br />you get the head, the tail,<br />the whole damn thing.

1415624 1417125 Where is he?
1417208 1418335 Sitting in it.
1421504 1422839 Good God.

1436519 1439189 Hi, Dad. Just a little<br />longer. Please?
1439314 1440774 It's his birthday.
1440857 1441858 I don't want him<br />on the ocean!
1441983 1443735 He's not on the ocean,<br />he is in a boat.
1443818 1445195 He won't go<br />in the water.
1445320 1449699 I don't think he'll<br />go in the water again,<br />after what happened yesterday.
1451076 1453411 All right,<br />now don't say that.
1453745 1456748 I don't want that<br />to happen,<br />you know that.
1458208 1460126 I want him to read<br />the boating regulations,
1460210 1463380 the rules, before he<br />goes out on his own.
1463546 1467842 Michael,<br />did you hear your father?<br />Out of the water now!

1811936 1813730 I know you got<br />a lot on your hands.
1813813 1814939 What can we do<br />for you?
1815023 1817817 The best thing to do<br />is to see the remains
1817900 1819444 of the first victim,<br />the girl on the beach.
1819527 1821154 Okay, fine.<br />Just bear with me,<br />will you?

1909659 1912829 Partially<br />denuded bone remaining.<br />This was no boat accident.
1912912 1914956 Did you notify<br />the Coast Guard about this?
1915039 1917834 No. It was only<br />local jurisdiction.
1921045 1924632 The left arm, head,<br />the shoulders, sternum
1924715 1926134 and portions of<br />the rib cage are intact.

1936602 1940523 possibly <i>longimanus</i><br />or <i>Isurus glaucus.</i>
1941941 1945278 The enormous amount<br />of tissue loss prevents<br />any detailed analysis
1945361 1948865 however,<br />the attacking <i>squalus</i><br />must be considerably larger
1949073 1951451 than any normal <i>squalus</i><br />found in these waters.
1951534 1953828 Didn't you get out a boat<br />and check these waters?
1953911 1954954 No.
1955037 1956706 Well, this is<br />not a boat accident.
1957039 1960585 And it wasn't any propeller.<br />It wasn't any coral reef.
1960960 1962962 And it wasn't<br />Jack the Ripper.

2056305 2057473 I don't know.
2057682 2059141 I think it's a mako.
2059225 2060476 It's got a deep throat,<br />Frank.
2060560 2062603 Yeah, but what kind?<br />What kind of shark?
2062687 2063813 Tiger shark.
2065731 2066857 A what?
2066983 2068442 We can start<br />breathing again.

2069819 2071028 Oh, you bet he is.
2071153 2072738 What is this<br />bite radius crap?
2072822 2074198 That is a big mouth.
2074991 2076242 You stuff<br />your frigging head<br />in there, man,
2076325 2079328 and find out if<br />it's a man-eater.
2083499 2085835 All I'm saying is<br />that it may not be<br />the shark.
2085918 2087086 It's just a slight...
2087169 2090631 I want you to meet Matt.<br />This is Larry Vaughn,<br />our mayor.

2092675 2093634 Nice to meet you.
2093718 2095344 Terrific, huh, Mayor?
2096887 2099724 There are all kinds of<br />sharks in the waters.
2099807 2102018 Hammerheads,<br />white tips,<br />blues, makos.
2102435 2105104 And the chances<br />that these bozos<br />got the exact shark...
2105187 2107106 There are no other<br />sharks like this here.
2107189 2109108 It's 100-to-1.
2109692 2113821 I'm not saying that<br />this is not the shark.<br />It probably is, Martin.
2113904 2116741 It's a man-eater.<br />It's extremely rare<br />for these waters.
2116866 2119368 But the fact is,<br />the bite radius<br />on this animal
2119452 2121912 is different<br />than the wounds<br />on the victim.
2123372 2126083 I want to be sure.<br />You want to be sure.
2126167 2127710 We all want to<br />be sure, okay?
2127793 2129420 What I want to do<br />is very simple.
2129545 2132298 The digestive system<br />of this animal<br />is very slow.
2132381 2133507 Let's cut it open.
2133591 2135509 Whatever it's eaten<br />in the last 24 hours
2135593 2137053 is bound to<br />still be in there.
2137136 2139096 And then we'll be sure.
2144894 2147146 It may be the only way<br />to confirm it.
2147229 2149565 Look, fellows,<br />let's be reasonable.
2150066 2152276 This is not<br />the time or the place
2152401 2155946 to perform some kind<br />of a half-assed autopsy<br />on a fish.
2156822 2160534 And I am not<br />going to stand here<br />and see that thing cut open

2192191 2194944 that a girl got<br />killed here last week.
2196362 2197988 And you knew it.
2198948 2201659 You knew there was<br />a shark out there.
2203786 2205621 You knew<br />it was dangerous.
2205871 2208624 But you let people<br />go swimming anyway.
2213003 2215297 You knew all those things,
2218801 2221053 but still my boy<br />is dead now.
2225391 2228310 And there's nothing<br />you can do about it.
2233983 2235568 My boy is dead.
2241157 2243325 I wanted you<br />to know that.
2249123 2251167 (MELANCHOLIC INSTRUMENTAL<br />MUSIC PLAYING)
2256839 2259216 I'm sorry, Martin.<br />She's wrong.
2260885 2262428 No, she's not.
2267600 2268851 VAUGHN:<br />All right, fellows
2268934 2270895 let's cut this ugly<br />son of a bitch down
2270978 2272897 before it stinks up<br />the whole island.
2273022 2276734 Harve, you and Carl<br />take it out tomorrow<br />and dump it in the drink.
2278694 2281197 (SOMBER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
2348722 2350099 Come here.
2353477 2354937 Give us a kiss.
2355020 2356146 Why?
2358732 2360484 Because I need it.
2361151 2362778 (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
2364780 2366448 Get out of here.
2367575 2368701 ELLEN: Can I help you?
2368784 2370369 HOOPER: The door was open.<br />Mind if I come in?
2370452 2371996 I'm Matt Hooper.
2372079 2373539 Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.
2373622 2375124 Your husband's home?<br />Yes.
2375207 2376834 I'd really like<br />to talk to him.
2376917 2378502 Yes, so would I.
2379461 2381714 Come in.<br />Can I get you<br />some coffee?
2381797 2383007 No. Nothing, thank you.
2383090 2384758 Oh, wine. How nice.
2403694 2405362 How was your day?
2406697 2408324 (BOTH LAUGHING)
2411243 2412453 Swell.
2415664 2418500 I got red and white.<br />I didn't know what<br />you'd be serving.
2418584 2420044 Oh, that's nice.
2421337 2423297 Is anyone eating this?
2423380 2424590 No.
2432806 2435517 My husband tells me<br />you're in sharks.
2436435 2437561 (LAUGHS)
2438145 2441148 Excuse me. Yes.<br />I've never heard it<br />quite put that way.
2441231 2442733 But yes, I am.
2443192 2444485 I love sharks.
2444568 2445611 You love sharks?
2445694 2447029 Yeah, I love them.
2447112 2449365 When I was 12 years old,<br />my father got me a boat
2449448 2451200 and I went fishing<br />off of Cape Cod.
2451283 2453452 I hooked a scup and<br />as I was reeling it in
2453535 2456372 I hooked a 4.5 foot<br />baby thresher shark
2456455 2458082 who proceeded<br />to eat my boat.
2459583 2463212 He ate my oar, hooks,<br />and my seat cushions.
2463295 2464672 He turned an inboard<br />into an outboard
2464755 2468092 scared me to death,<br />and I swam back to shore.
2468175 2470636 When I was on the beach,<br />I turned around
2470719 2472680 and actually saw<br />my boat being<br />taken apart.
2472763 2475349 Ever since then,<br />I have been<br />studying sharks
2475432 2479186 and that's why I know<br />that I'm going to go<br />to the Institute tomorrow
2479269 2481855 and tell them<br />that you still have<br />a shark problem here.
2481981 2483899 Why do you have<br />to tell them that?<br />Sorry.
2483983 2485609 I'm sorry,<br />I thought that...
2485693 2486986 You told me<br />the shark was caught.
2487069 2489655 I heard it on the news.<br />I heard it on<br />the Cape station.
2489738 2492324 They caught a shark,<br />not the shark.
2492825 2495411 Not the shark that<br />killed Chrissie Watkins.
2495619 2498288 And probably not the shark<br />that killed the little boy.
2498372 2501166 Which I wanted<br />to prove today by<br />cutting the shark open...
2501250 2504336 You may want to let<br />that breathe... Nothing.
2520936 2524273 You know, you'll be<br />the only rational man
2524356 2526066 left on this island<br />after I leave tomorrow.
2526775 2528318 Where are you going?
2529611 2531363 I am going<br />on the <i>Aurora.</i>
2531447 2532865 The <i>Aurora?</i><br />What is that?
2532948 2535868 It's a floating asylum<br />for shark addicts.
2535951 2537995 It's pure research,<br />18 months at sea.
2538412 2541957 Martin hates boats.<br />Martin hates water.
2542583 2546670 Martin sits in his car<br />when we go on the ferry<br />to the mainland.
2546962 2548964 I guess it's<br />a childhood thing.
2549048 2550716 There's a clinical name<br />for it, isn't there?
2550799 2552259 Drowning.
2553010 2554970 Is it true that most<br />people get attacked
2555054 2557306 by sharks in<br />three feet of water
2557389 2559016 about 10 feet<br />from the beach?
2559099 2560184 Yeah.
2560768 2564313 And that before<br />people started to swim<br />for recreation...
2564396 2567566 I mean, before sharks<br />knew what they were missing
2567649 2570944 that a lot<br />of these attacks<br />weren't reported?
2571028 2572279 That's right.
2574364 2577159 Now this shark<br />that swims alone
2577284 2578452 what's it called?<br />Rogue.
2578535 2579953 Rogue, yeah.
2580412 2583499 This guy,<br />he keeps swimming around
2583582 2585375 in a place where<br />the feeding is good
2585459 2587336 until the food<br />supply is gone, right?
2587419 2588921 That's called<br />territoriality.
2589004 2592257 It's just a theory that<br />I happen to agree with.
2594843 2596428 Then why don't we<br />have one more drink
2596512 2599014 and go down<br />and cut that shark open?
2599515 2602226 Martin?<br />Can you do that?
2606063 2609066 I can do anything.<br />I'm the Chief of Police.
2610400 2611819 (FOGHORN BLOWING)

2650858 2651984 (EXCLAIMS)
2652067 2653152 Just like I thought.
2653235 2654236 What?
2655237 2658574 Came up in the Gulf Stream,<br />from southern waters.
2663871 2665164 He didn't eat a car,<br />did he?
2665247 2666373 No.
2666707 2669459 Tiger shark's<br />like a garbage can.<br />It'll eat anything.
2669543 2672504 Somebody probably<br />threw that in the river.
2672796 2674548 (PANTING)
2678802 2680179 That's it.
2682014 2685100 I've got to<br />close the beach,<br />call the Mayor.
2685934 2688312 You got a bigger<br />problem than that,<br />Martin.
2688395 2690939 You still got a hell<br />of a fish out there
2691023 2692816 with a mouth<br />about this big.
2697321 2699489 How do we confirm that<br />by morning?
2700324 2704328 If he is a rogue,<br />and there's any truth<br />to territoriality at all
2704411 2706205 we got a good chance<br />of spotting him
2706288 2707998 between Cape Scott<br />and South Beach.
2708081 2709208 Where are you going?
2709291 2710709 To find him.<br />He's a night feeder.
2710834 2711835 On the water?
2711919 2713420 We're not gonna<br />find him on the land.
2713503 2714880 I'm not drunk enough<br />to go on a boat.
2714963 2716006 Yes, you are.
2716089 2717382 No, I'm not.<br />Yes, you are.
2717466 2718926 I can't do that.<br />Yes, you can.
2723680 2725182 (BOAT ENGINE WHIRRING)
2728101 2731730 I'm telling you,<br />the crime rate in<br />New York will kill you.
2731813 2735734 There's so many problems,<br />you never feel like you're<br />accomplishing anything.

2742366 2745369 But in Amity,<br />one man can<br />make a difference.
2745869 2748080 In 25 years,<br />there's never been
2748163 2749831 a shooting or a murder<br />in this town.
2750707 2753210 No kidding?<br />Want a pretzel?
2753961 2755170 Where are we?
2755254 2758257 We're right in the stretch<br />where he's been feeding.
2760717 2762594 Can you get<br /><i>The Late Show</i><br />on this thing?
2762678 2764263 No, it's a closed<br />circuit TV system.
2764346 2766890 I have underwater<br />cameras fore-and-aft.
2767516 2769226 Who pays<br />for all this stuff?
2769309 2770727 The government?<br />The Institute?
2770811 2772854 This stuff costs<br />a lot of money.
2774398 2776775 I paid for this<br />mostly myself, actually.
2776858 2778652 You're kidding.<br />No.
2779319 2780988 You rich?<br />Yeah.
2781780 2783156 How much?
2783240 2784741 Personally,<br />or the whole family?
2786201 2790330 Doesn't make any sense.<br />They pay a guy like you<br />to watch sharks?
2790747 2794209 Well, it doesn't<br />make sense for a guy
2794293 2795836 who hates the water to<br />live on an island either.
2796628 2799715 It's only an island<br />if you look at it<br />from the water.
2799965 2801758 That makes<br />a lot of sense.
2807723 2809474 BRODY: What is<br />that thing doing?
2810851 2812894 Well, it's a fish finder.
2812978 2815063 It's probably just<br />a school of mackerel<br />or something,
2815147 2817149 all clumped together.

2819651 2821194 Wait a minute.
2825657 2827409 There's something else<br />out there.

3023647 3025732 This is a great white,<br />Larry. A big one.
3025815 3028693 Any shark expert<br />will tell you it's<br />a killer, a man-eater.
3028777 3031530 The situation is<br />that apparently<br />a great white shark
3031613 3033907 has staked a claim<br />in the waters<br />off Amity Island.
3033990 3037202 He'll continue to feed here<br />as long as there's food<br />in the water.
3037285 3038870 There's no limit<br />to what he'll do.
3038954 3040330 We've had<br />three incidents.
3040413 3042832 Two people<br />killed within a week.<br />It'll happen again.
3042916 3045001 It happened before.<br />The Jersey beach, 1916.
3045126 3047045 Five people<br />were killed...<br />In one week.
3047128 3048380 Tell him<br />about the swimmers.
3048463 3051716 A shark is attracted<br />to the exact kind of<br />splashing and activity
3051800 3054636 that occurs<br />whenever human beings swim.<br />You can't avoid it.
3054719 3058390 Opening the beaches on<br />the Fourth of July is like<br />ringing the dinner bell.
3058473 3059849 Look, Mr. Vaughn
3059933 3062644 I pulled a tooth<br />the size of a shot glass
3062727 3064271 out of the wrecked hull<br />of a boat out there.
3064354 3065855 It was the tooth<br />of a great white.
3065939 3067607 It was Gardner's boat,<br />all chewed up.
3067691 3069985 I helped tow it in.<br />You should've seen it!
3070068 3072821 Where is that tooth?<br />Did you see it, Brody?
3073196 3074823 I didn't see it.<br />He dropped it<br />on the way in.
3074906 3076950 I had an accident.
3077117 3080287 And what did<br />you say the name<br />of this shark is?
3081621 3084541 It's a <i>Carcharodon carcharias.</i><br />It's a great white.
3084749 3086710 You don't<br />have the tooth?
3087961 3090797 Look, we depend on<br />the summer people<br />for our very lives...
3090880 3093967 You won't have a summer<br />unless you deal<br />with this problem!
3094050 3097220 We have to close the beach<br />and hire someone<br />to kill the shark!
3097304 3099097 We have to tell<br />the Coast Guard.
3099180 3102142 You'll have to contact<br />the Shark Research Panel.
3102225 3104519 You'll have to ring<br />this entire harbor!
3104603 3106313 I don't think<br />either one of you
3106396 3108106 are familiar<br />with our problems!
3108189 3110400 I think that<br />I am familiar<br />with the fact
3110483 3112652 that you'll ignore<br />this particular problem
3112736 3115071 until it swims up and<br />bites you in the ass!
3115155 3118158 Wait a second!<br />There are two ways<br />to deal with this problem!
3118241 3121369 You either kill this animal<br />or cut off its food supply.
3121453 3123330 BRODY: We have to<br />close the beaches.
3123413 3124539 Brody?
3125123 3127167 Sick vandalism.
3127250 3131338 That is<br />a deliberate mutilation<br />of a public service message.
3131630 3134549 I want those little<br />paint-happy bastards<br />caught
3134633 3136343 and hung up by<br />their Buster Browns.
3136426 3139471 That's it.<br />I won't waste my time<br />arguing with a man
3139554 3140764 who's lining up<br />to be a hot lunch.
3140847 3142140 I'm gonna see<br />you later, Brody.
3142223 3144309 Don't do this.<br />He's not...
3150940 3155779 What we are dealing with here<br />is a perfect engine,<br />an eating machine.
3156363 3158073 It's really<br />a miracle of evolution.
3158156 3161993 All this machine does<br />is swim and eat
3162243 3164746 and make little sharks.<br />And that's all.
3164954 3167749 Why don't you take<br />a long, close look<br />at this sign?
3167832 3170001 Those proportions<br />are correct.

4453533 4457079 Next time,<br />you just ask me which<br />line to pull, right?
4462417 4465337 Little brown eel<br />comes out of the cave
4466254 4468131 swims into the hole
4469549 4472803 comes out of the hole,<br />goes back into<br />the cave again.
4473887 4475639 It's not too good,<br />is it?
4476556 4479226 Nothing's easy, is it?<br />One more time.
4479476 4481186 Little brown eel...

4563185 4565228 What?<br />Get behind me.
4568648 4570400 Hooper, reverse her!
4571234 4573236 Taking a hell<br />of a lot of line!
4573320 4576782 Chief, get the scoop<br />out of the bucket!<br />Wet the reel!
4580577 4582662 Hooper, reverse her!
4586416 4589753 Duck your head down.<br />We're swinging.<br />Get behind me again.
4590128 4593006 No more water.<br />I don't want you<br />to drown me.
4593632 4597052 Hooper,<br />you idiot, starboard!<br />Ain't you watching it!
4601056 4602516 Hooper, neutral.
4609898 4611691 Where'd he go now?
4612442 4614277 He ain't fooling me.
4615362 4617405 What's he yanking on now?
4618281 4619866 Go on, try it.
4632462 4635549 I don't know, Chief,<br />if he's very smart<br />or very dumb.
4642556 4643723 Jesus...
4647435 4648895 He's gone under.
4649104 4652899 He's gone under the boat.<br />I think he's gone<br />under the boat.
4653692 4655235 Yeah, it's too easy.
4655360 4658613 He is a smart, big fish.<br />He's gone under the boat.
4659114 4662367 Keep her steady, now.<br />I got something very big!
4662576 4663994 I don't think so.
4665162 4667122 Chief, put your gloves on.
4667706 4670292 You put your gloves on,<br />both of you!
4672961 4675005 Getting ready<br />to run out again.
4675755 4677382 Quint, let it go.
4677465 4680177 Maybe you're a big yahoo<br />in the lab,

4684472 4687392 You don't want<br />to listen to me,<br />don't listen to me.
4687475 4688685 It's not a shark.
4688768 4690812 The wire's showing.
4690896 4692355 Unbuckle me.
4693273 4694858 Get the other side.
4694941 4696484 It's a tuna<br />or swordfish
4697235 4698904 wasting our time.
4699613 4701114 Take this rod.
4701198 4702866 Hooper, give the Chief<br />a hand, will you?
4702949 4703992 Right!
4704075 4705118 Oh, shit!
4715295 4718006 It may be a marlin<br />or a stingray
4718632 4720842 but it's definitely<br />a game fish.
4732604 4733980 Gaming fish?
4734689 4738068 Marlin, stingray bit<br />through this piano wire?
4738151 4739861 Don't you tell me<br />my business again.
4740153 4741154 You get back<br />on the bridge.
4741238 4743782 Quint, that doesn't<br />prove a damn thing.
4743865 4745992 It proves one thing,<br />Mr. Hooper.
4746076 4749246 You wealthy<br />college boys don't have<br />the education enough
4749329 4751081 to admit<br />if you're wrong.

4782737 4784447 And then<br />I jab at them.
4784739 4788201 I'm not going<br />to haul them up<br />like a lot of catfish.

5355476 5358646 Mr. Hooper, that's<br />the <i>U. S. S. Indianapolis.</i>
5366195 5368155 You were<br />on the <i>Indianapolis?</i>
5368322 5369615 What happened?
5371617 5375663 Japanese submarine<br />slammed two torpedoes<br />into her side, Chief.
5376998 5380877 I was coming back<br />from the island<br />of Tinian to Leyte
5380960 5384088 just delivered the bomb,<br />the Hiroshima bomb.
5387258 5390011 1,100 men went<br />into the water.
5390094 5391929 Vessel went down<br />in 12 minutes.
5394307 5397226 Didn't see the first shark<br />for about half an hour.
5397476 5399395 Tiger, 13-footer.
5399478 5402356 You know how you know that<br />when you're in the water,<br />Chief?
5402440 5405693 You tell by looking<br />from the dorsal<br />to the tail.
5407278 5409155 Well, we didn't know.
5409530 5412658 Because our bomb mission<br />had been so secret
5413451 5415828 no distress signal<br />had been sent.
5416913 5418164 (CHUCKLES)
5422501 5425546 They didn't even list us<br />overdue for a week.
5427006 5430509 Very first light,<br />sharks come cruising
5431010 5433930 so we formed ourselves<br />into tight groups.
5434805 5437642 You know, kind of<br />like old squares
5437725 5439310 in a battle like<br />you see on a calendar
5439393 5442188 like the Battle<br />of Waterloo.<br />The idea was...
5442271 5443898 the shark comes<br />to the nearest man
5443981 5446776 and he starts pounding,<br />hollering and screaming.
5446859 5449487 Sometimes the shark<br />would go away...
5450446 5452448 but sometimes<br />he wouldn't go away.
5452531 5456786 Sometimes that shark,<br />he looks right into you,<br />right into your eyes.
5456953 5458162 (SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
5458245 5460873 You know, a thing<br />about a shark, he's got...
5461332 5465336 lifeless eyes.<br />Black eyes,<br />like a doll's eyes.
5466963 5470466 When he comes at you,<br />he doesn't seem to<br />be living
5470800 5475721 until he bites you.<br />Those black eyes roll<br />over white and then...
5477223 5480726 Then you hear<br />that terrible<br />high-pitched screaming.
5481143 5483062 The ocean turns red.
5483479 5487316 In spite of the pounding<br />and the hollering,<br />they all come in.
5489026 5490736 They rip you<br />to pieces.
5490987 5493197 (GRAVE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
5495574 5498577 You know,<br />by the end of<br />that first dawn...
5499745 5501372 we lost 100 men.
5502873 5505418 I don't know<br />how many sharks.<br />Maybe 1,000.
5505543 5508587 I don't know how many men,<br />they averaged six an hour.
5509213 5512174 On Thursday morning,<br />I bumped into a friend<br />of mine...
5512258 5514677 Herbie Robinson,<br />from Cleveland.
5515886 5518514 Baseball player,<br />bosun's mate.
5520599 5524645 I thought he was asleep.<br />Reached over to wake him up.
5526272 5530109 He bobbed up and down<br />in the water just<br />like a kind of top.
5530776 5532069 Upended.
5536115 5538784 He'd been bitten in half,<br />below the waist.
5542621 5546709 Noon the fifth day,<br />a Lockheed Ventura saw us.
5546792 5549920 He swung in low<br />and he saw us.<br />He was a young pilot.
5550004 5551213 Younger than Mr. Hooper.
5551297 5554133 He saw us<br />and he came in low,<br />and three hours later...
5554258 5557720 a big fat PBY comes down<br />and starts to pick us up.
5557803 5560639 That was the time<br />I was most frightened.
5561307 5563142 Waiting for my turn.
5564518 5567271 I'll never put on<br />a life jacket again.
5568981 5571442 So, 1,100 men went<br />into the water
5572151 5574070 316 men come out.
5574153 5578115 The sharks took the rest,<br />June 29, 1945.
5581077 5584830 Anyway,<br />we delivered the bomb.

5795124 5796709 Pull your left hand down.
5796792 5799837 I can't. It'll only go<br />about three inches.
5800004 5801797 HOOPER: All of our<br />injectors got scored

5820190 5822776 The barrel is up,<br />it's right in the stern.
5826780 5830200 I think he's<br />right under the keg.<br />Grab the boat hook.
5841545 5844006 Quint, if we can<br />get close enough...
5845424 5847176 I've got things on board<br />that'll kill it.
5847259 5850137 Just want to<br />goose him up.<br />Come on.

5861982 5865694 When he runs,<br />you drop that rope<br />or you'll lose your hands.

5934888 5936181 Boys,
5937850 5940519 I think he's come back<br />for his noon feeding.
5942020 5943814 Hook me up<br />another barrel.
5944356 5946358 (TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
5974428 5976263 Bring her around<br />after him.

6054299 6056134 Run him down, Hooper.

6094965 6098302 I can't believe it.<br />Two barrels and<br />he's going down again.
6103932 6105350 It's incredible.
6111398 6113317 They're up again!<br />Now what?
6122576 6124953 Why don't we lead<br />the shark into shore
6125037 6126830 instead of him<br />leading us out to sea?
6131293 6133003 Grab a couple of poles.

6138216 6140719 Into starboard. Easy.
6141678 6143722 I'm going to<br />back her off now.
6143805 6145599 Watch those barrels, boys.<br />Watch them.
6150145 6152230 All right, gentlemen,<br />snag them.
6157486 6159863 Now then, tie them<br />to the stern cleats.
6163116 6165744 Brody, bring your end<br />around the cleat.
6166787 6170332 That's right,<br />it'll lock itself off.<br />Give him room, Brody.

6209371 6211456 Back home we got<br />a taxidermy man.
6211540 6212999 He's going to<br />have a heart attack
6213083 6215752 when he sees<br />what I brought him.<br />(LAUGHS)
6221633 6224469 Throttle back.<br />You're losing a cleat.
6227180 6229850 My God, this one, too.<br />They're both going.
6230100 6232018 He's eating his way<br />through that line.
6232102 6233979 He's working his way<br />right up to us.
6234104 6236940 Quint!<br />Come on, Quint. Hurry!
6239484 6240777 Out of my way.
6245991 6246992 Watch it.

6257502 6259463 Make it fast! We got<br />another line in him!

6330242 6331743 What about us?
6332285 6335956 Hooper, get the pump<br />out of the locker<br />in front of you, will you?
6336414 6338166 We're going to sink,<br />aren't we?
6338250 6341211 Keep an eye on the barrels.<br />Pump it out, Chief.
