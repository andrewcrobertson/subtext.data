13664 15928 <i>Stand by. Background action.<br />Yeah.</i>
15999 17091 <i>Action.</i>
17184 18367 <i>Action!</i>
20821 22289 Okay, hang on.
24408 26035 <i>The shark is networking.</i>
29196 31995 <i>We're having a little<br />problem with the shark here.</i>
32099 33191 Bob, we need you.
33734 35828 <i>The shark is not working.</i>
35936 37415 <i>Roy?</i>
37487 38682 <i>Has anybody seen Roy?</i>
38755 41952 <i>The shark is not working.<br />Repeat, the shark is not working.</i>
47164 48848 <i>Can't get it to work at all.</i>
50334 51642 <i>AH right, let's try this again.</i>
51752 53436 <i>Okay, rolling.<br />Action!</i>
62296 64606 <i>The shark is working again.</i>
67618 70610 <i>Joe here, the boat is sinking.</i>
72773 74548 <i>Three decades after the release</i>
74625 78141 <i>of what many consider to be<br />the original summer blockbuster,</i>
78245 81943 <i>stories of the hardships<br />experienced during the filming of Jaws</i>
82049 84484 <i>are the stuff of Hollywood legend.</i>
84585 88635 It filled me up with stories that<br />I could dine out on for 35 years.
88722 93592 <i>If I wanted to, I could just hold<br />back any but the stories from Jaws.</i>
94628 97677 <i>Through accounts<br />like Carl Gottlieb's The Jaws Log</i>
97748 101798 <i>and numerous television<br />documentaries, multitudes of movie buffs</i>
101902 106339 <i>are familiar with those famous<br />tales of the shark not working.</i>
108392 111874 We were all groping in the<br />dark for a way to tell the story,
111979 114914 <i>because the shark wasn't<br />working. It kept breaking down.</i>
115015 119179 <i>It is as if God created the devil</i>
119286 121721 <i>and gave him jaws.</i>
126310 130258 <i>Jaws, one of<br />Hollywood's little movies that couldn't,</i>
130364 133777 <i>emerged as a record-shattering<br />box office juggernaut,</i>
134034 135798 <i>then an Oscar contender.</i>
135886 139880 <i>And today, stands as a<br />critically-acclaimed enduring classic</i>
139956 144325 <i>that after all this time shows<br />no sign of losing its bite.</i>
144411 149429 What we are dealing with here is a<br />perfect engine, an eating machine.
150534 153913 Michael, did you hear your<br />father? Out of the water now!
154021 156820 <i>Opening the beaches on the Fourth<br />of July is like ringing the dinner bell.</i>
156907 159171 This shark, swallow you whole.
161228 163742 My heart was beating so fast.
163814 166761 I didn't know, as an adult, I<br />could get that soared anymore.
166867 170565 <i>One thing, it's a real thing,<br />not a monster from outer space.</i>
170671 172651 <i>Sharks are</i> real.
172723 176182 <i>The film sparked a<br />pop cultural obsession with sharks</i>
176259 179342 <i>and heightened public<br />awareness of real life shark attacks.</i>
180931 184947 <i>And though numerous copycat<br />pictures have come and gone,</i>
185052 189046 <i>Jaws still remains that<br />singular cinematic experience</i>
189156 191898 <i>that keeps bathers close to the shore.</i>
194728 198107 The movie itself is what<br />first put the terror into me.
198181 200843 Every time you felt a bit<br />of seaweed brush your foot,
200917 202476 <i>you would have been thinking about it.</i>
202552 207467 I still get a little nervous in water,<br />being like, "Is there a shark in here?"
208842 212540 <i>Not only did it impact<br />the way movies are made and marketed,</i>
212646 216549 <i>but it maintains a legacy<br />kept alive by legions of fans,</i>
216650 219699 <i>artists and even successful filmmakers,</i>
219770 223866 <i>who cite this picture<br />as a defining life experience,</i>
223940 225874 <i>helping to make them who they are today.</i>
225942 229708 Anyone who's around my age,<br />who is in this movie business,
229780 231896 always cites Jaws as the first movie
231982 234098 <i>that made them want to get into movies.</i>
235952 238717 <i>It's therefore no<br />wonder that after 30 years,</i>
238789 241520 <i>the shark is indeed still working.</i>
261428 264841 <i>When I was writing Jaws,<br />I knew that it could not be a success.</i>
264915 266497 <i>It couldn't be a success as a novel</i>
266600 269444 <i>because, first of all, it's a first<br />novel and nobody reads first novels.</i>
269536 273586 It was a first novel about a fish,<br />so give me a break, who cares?
273657 275489 I knew they couldn't make a movie about it
275559 277857 because the technology<br />was nowhere near good enough
277928 281455 to make a great white shark, and I<br />knew you couldn't catch and train one.
281548 285314 <i>So I had no sense that this<br />was going to be a success</i>
285402 289202 beyond just being published, until<br />the movie had been open for a while
289272 292207 and the paperback was<br />selling millions of copies.
292275 294721 And even then, who would've guessed
294828 298310 that down the road it would<br />have had any currency?
298415 299826 I wouldn't have.
301001 303845 <i>Making</i> Jaws,<br /><i>still looking back 30 years ago,</i>
303937 305701 <i>was the toughest film making production</i>
305806 307490 <i>experience I've ever encountered.</i>
307574 311488 Nothing's ever come close<br />to the production difficulties
311578 314639 of shooting an actual<br />special effects movie,
314748 317592 not a digital effects movie,<br />that was many, many years later,
317667 319544 but a mechanical effects movie,
319653 321917 <i>not in a tank somewhere in Malta</i>
322022 324241 <i>or some safe tank somewhere in Florida,</i>
324307 326503 <i>but in the actual Atlantic Ocean.</i>
326593 329392 <i>We must've been complete idiots</i>
329496 332238 <i>to have even expected to have an easy ride</i>
332315 334500 <i>in the middle of the ocean making a movie.</i>
334601 335864 The in gathering
336720 340133 of all the mystical tribes
340240 344939 and shamans and crazy<br />experts that floated in
345045 348356 <i>under the banner of Universal<br />to make this movie</i>
348431 352777 <i>had overlooked that it was the first<br />film ever really shot on the ocean.</i>
353703 355728 They hadn't really known that before.
355856 358473 <i>The approach that Spielberg had then,</i>
358542 359907 <i>remember that he was fresh then,</i>
359993 361791 <i>he was new and young,</i>
361895 365160 <i>and he insisted that this<br />movie be shot on the ocean,</i>
365265 369213 and that alone was an innovation,
369286 370765 because Universal at the time
370871 374648 would normally have gone to<br />a back lake and shot on the lot,
374724 376089 and he wouldn't let them.
376192 381505 We all gained a tremendous<br />respect for the sea, for nature,
381615 385495 for currents and tides, for waves,
385569 389403 <i>for rain and sun and overexposure to both.</i>
390106 393656 <i>We started shooting on the first of May,</i>
393743 396735 <i>and we were supposed<br />to shoot until June 28th.</i>
398782 402025 If you're really quiet, you<br />could hear someone laughing.
402786 405096 <i>The movie<br />went on for</i> a <i>total of seven months,</i>
405205 406934 <i>something like that, almost</i> a year.
407040 409418 If you figured when<br />the first crew got there
409492 411176 and the first special effects people,
411278 415055 then the actors came and then<br />it just went on and on and on.
415131 418078 <i>And we thought we were gonna<br />be there for the rest of our lives.</i>
418168 421433 It's not the time it takes to<br />take the take that takes the time,
421504 423336 it's the time it takes between the takes
423406 425135 that takes the time that takes the take.
425609 428226 If you see, conditions<br />have been so impossible
428328 431093 that it's really hurt our schedule and
431181 435015 <i>put a general somber note<br />behind the scenes</i>
435085 438180 on the production, 'cause we've<br />been here 105 shooting days
438254 441337 and we were only scheduled<br />for something like 65 or 70.
442425 444143 <i>And they started the shoot</i>
444244 447339 without a cast, without a<br />script and without a shark.
448248 451730 <i>And that was after May 1st.</i>
452168 454682 <i>And we're going and we're shooting.</i>
454788 458167 <i>What are we shooting? I<br />don't know, what are we doing?</i>
460910 463151 I know because he'll be so energetic,
463263 464263 and he'll be screaming and yelling,
464364 466480 "It's a great white, it's a<br />great white. I knew it all along."
466549 467549 And it's onlyâ€¦
467634 469261 <i>It's hard to imagine a world</i>
469369 472862 <i>where Steven Spielberg<br />isn't a household name.</i>
472973 477126 <i>But in 1974, it was viewed<br />by some as a roll of the dice</i>
477193 480242 <i>to put the weight of such a<br />mammoth project on the shoulders</i>
480347 482873 <i>of a 27-year-old relative newcomer.</i>
482983 485509 <i>A director, who had<br />only just completed work</i>
485602 487661 <i>on his first theatrical release,</i>
487754 489404 The Sugar land Express.
489556 493186 <i>I remember a reporter one time asking me,</i>
493293 498163 "Mr. Zanuck, are you trying to<br />enhance this young director's career?"
498248 500080 And I said, "No, just the opposite.
500150 501948 "I'm trying to enhance my career."
502369 506784 <i>Probably nobody else in<br />the world knew at that time</i>
506856 511521 <i>better than I, who was every<br />day on The Sugar land Express,</i>
511795 515254 how good this guy was<br />and how he could tell a story.
515498 519583 Steven Spielberg story<br />boarded the actual scenes
519686 520801 and then shot them.
521421 523901 <i>And the studio production department</i>
523973 526487 <i>wanted to know every storyboard there</i> was.
526710 529395 <i>They didn't know every<br />storyboard there was.</i>
529496 532193 <i>We had a bunch of 'em<br />that we never told 'em about</i>
532282 534501 <i>that we would sneak and shoot.</i>
534651 536130 It was a guerrilla movie.
536286 540086 I like to think of it<br />as a big independent movie
540356 543235 masquerading as a big studio movie.
544561 548862 <i>It was the film's title<br />monster, a 12-ton hydraulic shark,</i>
548932 551560 <i>that would become<br />affectionately known as Bruce,</i>
551634 554786 <i>that plagued Spielberg<br />and the Jaws production team</i>
554888 558347 <i>with their most daunting set<br />of complications.</i>
558525 561051 <i>Once the idea<br />was set that we're gonna build it,</i>
561161 562845 <i>then we had to determine the size,</i>
562912 566530 and I was working off of a scale model
566633 569364 of my research of a shark that<br />was about 12 and a half feet,
569469 571688 and so I just doubled it
571755 575271 because I felt that as<br />the sharks got bigger,
575375 578276 <i>they got girthier, and<br />they weren't so attractive.</i>
578378 582292 <i>So, I figured a 25-foot shark<br />would be the proper size.</i>
583500 586709 <i>Don Chandler was a studio sculptor.</i>
586820 589187 <i>He started on the outside,</i>
589289 591917 a <i>big clay model,<br />we were gonna make a mold.</i>
592025 596770 <i>And so we were making the<br />skeleton out of Permali tubing,</i>
596863 598456 <i>both things at once,</i>
598565 603196 <i>and hoping that they would fit<br />together perfectly, which they did.</i>
603303 606637 <i>My part that they gave<br />me, mostly, was the cosmetics of the thing</i>
606723 608839 <i>and the skin and<br />the looks of it and all that,</i>
608942 613402 and when something mechanical<br />would break in the shark,
613513 616790 the shark's head would turn<br />over, and of course it would rip
616883 619534 and then they would bring it<br />back to me and say, "Fix it."
619602 622003 <i>Then we'd have to patch the whole shark.</i>
623156 626126 <i>Veteran effects supervisor, Bob Mattey,</i>
626226 628388 <i>who had created the famous squid</i>
628495 630589 <i>from Disney's</i><br />20,000 <i>Leagues</i> Under <i>the Sea,</i>
630697 633906 <i>was mastermind of the<br />shark's mechanical workings.</i>
633983 635576 You got the men down there with the camera
635652 637211 over by the end down<br />by the fin. I'm not sure.
637287 640700 <i>Bob Mattey, my<br />mentor, was the greatest guy in the world.</i>
640807 643504 <i>He lovedâ€¦ I mean, he loved what he did.</i>
643610 647092 I just fell in right behind<br />Bob. He was like my hero.
647280 649191 <i>There was never ever a down day.</i>
649282 651125 <i>I mean, he was pretty much tireless.</i>
651201 654182 <i>And he always looked at the up side.</i>
654370 658250 <i>It was a good thing, too,<br />as Mattey and his team promptly discovered</i>
658358 660622 <i>that Jaws would produce<br />technical challenges</i>
660727 664686 <i>unlike any movie previously<br />attempted by Hollywood.</i>
664781 668615 The condition of the shark<br />was the ultimate story,
668685 671154 that if the shark didn't work,<br />what do you do?
671221 676705 When your lead actor, which is<br />this 12 ton marvel, is recalcitrant.
676793 681208 <i>Well, like any recalcitrant actor,<br />you shoot around him or her.</i>
682182 683957 <i>Not that a recalcitrant shark</i>
684033 687162 <i>was always to blame for<br />setbacks during the shoot.</i>
687237 691287 <i>For a Hollywood film crew with<br />little or no maritime experience,</i>
691391 694656 <i>finding their sea legs<br />didn't always come easily.</i>
698932 702414 <i>It didn't take long for one<br />thing to become perfectly clear.</i>
702669 706401 <i>Making Jaws, whether<br />by land or sea or foam,</i>
706506 708497 <i>would be no day at the beach.</i>
708691 711626 <i>We were starting<br />to shoot all of the land scenes</i>
711694 713571 <i>and running out of them very quickly.</i>
714163 719784 <i>And Carl Gottlieb and Roy,<br />David and Dick, producers,</i>
719886 723686 <i>Steven, myself and<br />Verna Fields and her son,</i>
723790 727590 <i>would meet every day at Steven's bungalow</i>
727694 732541 <i>and try to make sense of the<br />next day's work or the days after.</i>
734384 737843 <i>With no shark to<br />shoot and an ever inflating budget,</i>
737921 741073 <i>they made the very most of these meetings.</i>
741241 744233 <i>The logistical setbacks<br />allowed Spielberg and his actors</i>
744344 749339 <i>to become a little repertory<br />company, free to invent and improvise.</i>
749449 752885 The thing I remember most<br />is, Steven, obviously,
752986 756081 allowing the actors to ad lib,<br />because a lot of this was ad lib.
756189 758624 The, "You wanna get drunk and<br />fool around?" The "coffee."
758725 763993 <i>I mean, all theseâ€¦ "Dead<br />doll's eyes," that's my favorite.</i>
764097 767032 <i>I think that's one of the things<br />that was so extraordinary.</i>
768151 771086 <i>The scene with<br />the little boy at the table,</i>
771154 773998 <i>after Roy's had a particularly hard day,</i>
774107 776201 we were in between shots
776309 779643 and I was like this at the table,
779746 781214 <i>and then that little kid was like this.</i>
781314 785626 Just started with our hands<br />underneath our chin.
785702 787966 Then he'd do this and I'd do that.
788054 790580 Then I wentâ€¦ And he wentâ€¦
791024 794119 And he made a monster face<br />and I kind of went like thatâ€¦
796329 798764 And I went out to the kitchen in<br />the house and I said to Steven,
798865 802017 "Come here. Come here.<br />Watch this."
802085 804201 And I went through all the motions
804304 806989 and the little guy copied right after me.
807073 810555 He said, "Okay," and he brought<br />the camera in and we did that scene.
811044 812728 Hello?<br />Get out of here.
814097 816407 <i>With the summer season fully upon them,</i>
816516 820419 <i>frustration began to mount<br />amidst the already exhausted crew</i>
820520 824320 <i>as discouraging reports of the<br />film's malfunctioning antagonist</i>
824424 826791 <i>continued to spread across the island.</i>
827527 830474 <i>It's not the<br />first movie with the radio mics,</i>
830546 832378 <i>it was the first one that I was aware of</i>
832632 835533 <i>that had all these radio mics<br />all over the island.</i>
835902 839099 So every day, you could hear this.
840340 841808 The shark is not working.
841908 844684 Repeat. The shark is not<br />working.
844761 847822 Repeat. The sharkâ€¦<br />Not working.
848915 851077 <i>And that was the constant refrain,</i>
851184 853061 <i>because every time they tried<br />to test the shark,</i>
853136 854513 <i>it would come up likeâ€¦</i>
857724 859249 Or its eye would fall out.
859359 862772 I have a saying in films that
862845 864722 film companies import their problems,
864831 866663 they don't find them where they go.
866766 871044 And in our case, we imported<br />our problem and that was the shark,
871304 876367 <i>and we didn't have enough<br />testing time on Bob Mattey's behalf.</i>
876476 878570 <i>If we'd given him<br />the 15 weeks that it took</i>
878678 880726 <i>to work the bugs out of the shark,</i>
880797 882891 <i>it would've worked on cue.</i>
882965 886674 We were pioneers. That's<br />the best word I can think of,
886853 888947 because nobody had ever taken on
889055 891114 the Atlantic Ocean in small boats.
891391 894122 No one had ever worked with<br />a mechanical shark
894227 896878 <i>of the sophistication of ours.</i>
897163 900758 <i>We struggled like mad, but<br />the end justified the means.</i>
900917 902658 Then one day, you heard thisâ€¦
902769 906114 The shark<br />is working. Repeat, the shark is working.
906189 908214 Repeat, the sharkâ€¦
908291 911226 What you see in the finished picture
911294 916664 <i>is practically every frame of<br />usable footage of the shark.</i>
920369 921552 And down.
924207 925254 <i>Suits and all.</i>
925425 929328 One more time. Shark comes up,
929429 931579 bites at the masts,
931647 934480 snaps two, three times,<br />shaking their head,
934567 936114 but always working its way into the masts.
936202 939945 Okay, start it.<br />Okay, Roy? Action.
943226 944534 Bring it in. Bring it in.
946479 948072 <i>And the last shot, before we all went back</i>
948181 951958 to Long Beach for another<br />month of shooting in California,
952034 954651 was going to be the shot<br />of the shark blowing up.
957707 960722 We were rigging the shark<br />to blow up and blow scrib
960827 964821 and all kinds of stuff up into<br />the air, and they were loading it.
964931 967559 <i>And finally, the sun went down<br />and I'm shooting high speed</i>
967667 971570 <i>and I said, "Steven, they're not<br />ready and I can't shoot high speed."</i>
972522 975287 Steven said, "You shoot it<br />in the morning."
975358 977736 Steven went to the airport,<br />got onto the airplane,
977844 980996 he was already packed, and left the<br />island. He was ready to go.
981314 983305 I said, "Goodbye!<br />I'm going back to L.A."
983416 986158 And I got into a motorboat,<br />sped back to the mainland.
986586 990170 <i>Steven and I were on a flight back to L-A.</i>
990256 994318 And I said, "So, who'sâ€¦<br />How was the last shot?"
995795 997638 You know, they blow up theâ€¦
997713 1000648 He saw, "They're doing it right now."
1002168 1005012 I said, "They're doing it right<br />now, why aren't you there?"
1005087 1007181 He goesâ€¦
1010293 1012762 And I said, "Steven?"
1013829 1016048 <i>He said something likeâ€¦ He got word,</i>
1016132 1017440 <i>he knew that they were gonna throw him in.</i>
1017550 1020451 <i>So, he decided to just skip<br />out and not do the last shot.</i>
1021137 1024300 Not do the last blowing up<br />shot, yeah, not do that one,
1024407 1026307 which became, by the way,<br />a tradition of Steven's.
1026409 1028787 He never would do the<br />last shot of his movies,
1028895 1031694 because he thought the crew<br />was always gonna do something.
1031781 1033772 And he probably was right.
1034267 1037009 Had I been on his crew, I would've.
1037853 1043053 But it's become a tradition that<br />Steven never shoots his last shot.
1044060 1048110 One day, I'm gonna use this information.
1057974 1060068 <i>With the production of the film completed</i>
1060142 1063021 <i>and Benchley's book<br />already a raging success,</i>
1063129 1065393 <i>the makers of Jaws braced themselves,</i>
1065698 1066915 <i>hoping the fruit of their labor</i>
1066983 1070294 <i>would live up to the reputation<br />of the novel that inspired it.</i>
1071087 1073738 <i>Little did they realize<br />that their fish story</i>
1073823 1076451 <i>was about to change the face of Hollywood.</i>
1078427 1081089 I couldn't really see beyond
1081163 1083677 all of the screw ups<br />that were apparent to me
1083783 1086263 and were more apparent than anything else.
1086369 1089578 And so in my ignorance,<br />which is pure ignorance,
1090323 1092906 <i>I was saying, "This is<br />gonna be a disaster."</i>
1093542 1095488 <i>And then we made this movie that</i>
1095595 1099008 <i>crashed into people like a speeding truck.</i>
1104337 1106954 <i>The book had become a best seller</i>
1107023 1108821 <i>while we were shooting the picture.</i>
1109091 1114029 But still, no one had any<br />thought or even dared to think
1114096 1116337 that it would become what it became.
1116449 1120067 <i>Part of it is<br />that, it was over-ambitious for the budget.</i>
1120136 1125154 The technology was not there, that<br />they had to use parts of their brain
1125241 1127084 that you don't normally have to
1127193 1128991 unless you're in desperate mode,
1129095 1131439 and when an artist is pushed like that,
1131514 1133824 amazing, one-of-a-kind things happen,
1133933 1135833 and that's what happened in Jaws.
1135935 1140998 <i>It was just an<br />extraordinary, perfect creative storm.</i>
1141257 1143419 Who knew? Who knew?
1143492 1148009 But you know, it's like<br />all of these phenomenons,
1148114 1149855 they just happen.
1150016 1152383 If you planned it, it would<br />never be a phenomenon.
1154804 1157023 <i>The film's groundbreaking ad campaign</i>
1157123 1160388 <i>was highly instrumental in<br />its initial box office success.</i>
1160493 1162222 I think Jaws affected film<br />making in a lot of ways.
1162328 1164376 That's when they first<br />started using television
1164447 1165915 to really advertise movies.
1165981 1168962 So, it made this huge opening,<br />and everybody went out to see it.
1169068 1172117 The anticipation was<br />unbelievable. Unbelievable.
1172188 1174714 No one had ever anticipated a movie
1174824 1176019 much like that that I remember.
1176092 1179505 <i>I mean, it really did create the<br />sensation around the planet of,</i>
1179612 1181387 <i>"All right, here it comes."</i>
1181464 1183683 <i>There is</i> a <i>creature alive today</i>
1184784 1187993 <i>who has survived millions<br />of years of evolutionâ€¦</i>
1188521 1191934 <i>Underscoring the TV<br />spots and theatrical trailers for Jaws</i>
1192007 1194624 <i>was the familiar, but ominous voice talent</i>
1194727 1198209 <i>of character actor and<br />voice artist, Percy Rodrigues.</i>
1198848 1204434 They had an idea of doing a<br />very high, horrifying delivery,
1205020 1206067 which I disagreed with.
1207289 1209371 And we discussed it.
1209492 1215431 And finally, they came around<br />to the idea that I had in mind,
1215498 1221551 that we would do it at a more<br />level, devastating presentation,
1221721 1225180 rather than trying to ride over
1225291 1229034 this terrifying visual that they had.
1229311 1233088 <i>I felt that I should go underneath<br />it and let the visual sell.</i>
1233866 1236949 <i>It is as if God created the devil</i>
1237953 1240354 <i>and gave him jaws.</i>
1241741 1245086 <i>The level of<br />advertising was very high-pitched,</i>
1245161 1248995 and afterwards, they had people<br />afraid to go in the water for years.
1249949 1254534 And I like to think that<br />I contributed to that fear.
1255905 1258749 <i>See it before you go swimming.</i>
1259175 1262611 <i>Everyone who grew<br />up around that period knows the voice.</i>
1262711 1267012 He was the gateway for a lot<br />of people into the <i>Jaws</i> universe.
1267082 1271383 He was like the weed to what<br />would become the crack of Jaws.
1271454 1274719 It's just like you had to get through<br />Percy and Percy's dulcet tones
1274907 1278559 that drew you into that movie and<br />then got you hooked in a big, bad way.
1280396 1282080 Once Jaws premiered,
1282181 1285128 <i>it demonstrated just how<br />hooked moviegoers were</i>
1285201 1288193 <i>and marked a decisive<br />turning point at the box office.</i>
1288304 1290568 <i>The buzz generated by advanced screenings</i>
1290639 1293301 <i>demanded that it<br />become the first movie ever</i>
1293375 1296003 <i>to be released in over 400 theaters.</i>
1296745 1298770 <i>And it could've been even more.</i>
1298848 1301613 <i>When the screening<br />in Long Beach, California took place,</i>
1301684 1305245 <i>Lew Wasserman, the chairman<br />of the board of Universal,</i>
1305321 1308655 asked Hy Martin, who<br />was the head of distribution,
1309208 1312269 to cut back on the number of theaters.
1312378 1316008 <i>Hy said, "We've set<br />a record. We've got 600 theaters.</i>
1316115 1318800 <i>"Ever since the Dallas preview,</i>
1318868 1321496 <i>"I cannot stop the phone from ringing."</i>
1321704 1322762 <i>And Lew said,</i>
1322872 1324237 "Cut it in half."
1325040 1328670 And everybody was kind of<br />stunned, "Cut it in half? Why?"
1329028 1332658 He said, "I want people<br />in Palm Springs, California
1332765 1335507 "to have to come to Los<br />Angeles to see the movie."
1335601 1338514 I don't think we thought<br />that we were releasing
1338621 1340715 <i>an "event movie."</i>
1340789 1342769 <i>We thought we had this<br />very successful movie,</i>
1342875 1345890 <i>we thought they should<br />be waiting to see it.</i>
1345995 1349579 <i>My colleague, Lew Wasserman,<br />always thought that the best advertising</i>
1349682 1351161 <i>was people standing in line.</i>
1351433 1355893 <i>Lew said, "I wanted this to<br />be something that you couldn't get into."</i>
1356071 1358688 <i>He wasn't interested<br />in just taking the weekend.</i>
1358791 1362386 <i>He wanted to take the summer,<br />and we took the summer.</i>
1362478 1365129 When you opened in 400<br />theaters, it was different.
1365231 1368314 You could play all summer,<br />and if you looked at the grosses,
1368384 1370182 the grosses were constant.
1370553 1375753 Smoking lounge is sold out, seats<br />downstairs in the first seven rows only.
1375824 1378293 <i>When the<br />movie was out for weeks and months,</i>
1378360 1380237 I would still be going to the movies.
1380346 1383031 Not to see a new movie,<br />but to see Jaws again.
1383098 1387399 And, "One for <i>Jaws, "</i> and<br />he'd look at me like, "Again?"
1387503 1389028 It's like, "Dude,<br />just give me the ticket."
1389505 1393191 <i>They began to<br />see that the film could become an event</i>
1393292 1395454 <i>and a marketing phenomenon.</i>
1395561 1398337 Of course, nowadays,<br />the marketing of a film
1398414 1400291 is more important than the film itself.
1400482 1404851 And I think we can attribute a<br />lot of that to the success of Jaws.
1405054 1407216 <i>It happened to work<br />on a very mainstream level</i>
1407323 1408734 <i>and a mass audience level,</i>
1408841 1410718 but the movie itself
1410793 1413444 was so incredibly solid and beyond solid,
1413529 1415748 just exceptional from end to end,
1415948 1418792 that when people throw<br />together their summer movies
1418867 1421393 and the eye candy stuff,<br />they just tend to forget that
1421503 1423972 that movie was a lot more<br />than just eye candy.
1424406 1427023 <i>Although it is<br />credited with having started</i>
1427126 1429709 <i>the syndrome of summer blockbusters,</i>
1429778 1433225 and mindless movies and all that stuff,
1433332 1437246 the fact is that <i>Jaws,</i> and I<br />think many critics will agree,
1437453 1441981 was a fine movie of that<br />genre, which was very rare.
1462428 1465841 <i>Given its monstrous<br />success and critical acclaim,</i>
1466015 1468256 <i>Jaws was roundly expected to receive</i>
1468367 1470995 <i>the lion's share of Oscar<br />nominations for that year,</i>
1471737 1474479 <i>including Best Director<br />for Steven Spielberg.</i>
1475024 1478824 <i>But unfortunately, those high<br />expectations came up short.</i>
1479712 1482864 Oh, I didn't get it.<br />I didn't get it.
1483599 1487297 I wasn't nominated.<br />I got beaten out by Fellini.
1488404 1491032 <i>Jaws did get<br />the nomination for Best Picture.</i>
1491306 1492455 Jaws.
1494943 1496877 Well, it's about time.
1496945 1498674 <i>But it was in light of this</i>
1498764 1501244 <i>that some in the industry<br />thought it scandalous</i>
1501316 1503842 <i>that Steven would be<br />overlooked for Best Director.</i>
1503952 1506296 Who made the picture?<br />Somebody's mother?
1506405 1507486 The director.
1507589 1508636 This man made Jaws.
1508741 1511085 Are you kidding? Who's<br />kidding who around here?
1511160 1513208 It's the biggest disappointment<br />for me, the whole Oscars.
1513312 1517271 I thought Steven did a<br />brilliant job directing <i>Jaws,</i>
1517383 1519215 and I have no idea what happened.
1519318 1521537 It's the one thing<br />that I cannot comprehend yet
1521603 1525062 in my head, how a best<br />picture can be nominated,
1525157 1528366 and yet the director, who is<br />basically responsible for it,
1528444 1530173 does not get the nomination.
1530512 1533743 <i>But for the<br />27-year-old wunderkind director,</i>
1533816 1535750 <i>there was no choice but to take his lumps.</i>
1535818 1537377 I'm suffering enough.<br />All right.
1537453 1538818 We're suffering with you.<br />I'm suffering.
1538887 1540252 We're suffering with you.<br />Cancel my day.
1540355 1541355 Right, we're getting to itâ€¦
1541440 1544922 <i>Although Jaws did<br />not receive the Oscar for Best Picture,</i>
1544993 1548657 <i>it did bring home awards for<br />its remaining three nominations.</i>
1548731 1553441 <i>Best Sound, Best Editing<br />and Best Musical Score.</i>
1555003 1556619 <i>Throughout the rest of the year,</i>
1556722 1560033 <i>Jaws continued to reel in<br />numerous other industry awards,</i>
1560109 1563056 <i>even as the record books<br />were being re-written.</i>
1565731 1569167 <i>In hindsight, one wonders<br />if the Academy would rethink</i>
1569268 1572260 <i>overlooking Spielberg's<br />masterful work on</i> Jaws,
1572371 1575022 <i>if they knew then what<br />they certainly know now.</i>
1580913 1584816 <i>Of course, a much decorated<br />career still lay ahead for Steven.</i>
1585501 1588220 <i>A now legendary career<br />that encompasses, perhaps,</i>
1588303 1590567 <i>the most popular and diverse body of work</i>
1590672 1593289 <i>ever created by an individual director,</i>
1593392 1596339 <i>making Steven Spielberg one<br />of the most influential figures</i>
1596411 1598027 <i>in the entire film industry.</i>
1599348 1602227 <i>And it was all jump-started by Jaws.</i>
1609475 1613878 <i>Audience fascination with Jaws<br />was by no means limited to the U. S.</i>
1614263 1616163 <i>Shortly after its domestic release,</i>
1616248 1619331 <i>Jaws swam its way into<br />theaters across the globe.</i>
1619535 1621697 <i>And moviegoers couldn't get enough.</i>
1621970 1623961 <i>The biggest thing I remember about Jaws</i>
1624072 1627121 is traveling around the world,<br />promoting it.
1627810 1634159 <i>And whether it was in South<br />Africa or Australia or Latin America,</i>
1634550 1638066 <i>every culture in the world embraced Jaws.</i>
1640439 1643648 <i>Peter Benchley's book,<br />which was the start of it all,</i>
1643725 1645352 <i>was a sensation.</i>
1645460 1649658 <i>Somehow the idea of this<br />creature attacking mankind</i>
1649882 1651509 <i>caught on everywhere.</i>
1653152 1654836 <i>I've been to many places in the world,</i>
1654920 1658038 <i>and Jaws has reached almost<br />every place I've ever been.</i>
1658106 1660598 At first, I thought maybe<br />it'll do okay in cities
1660676 1663088 near great bodies of water.
1663195 1664970 But it turned out<br />some of our best business
1665047 1666776 were in tremendous desert countries.
1666949 1670158 <i>I think the reason it went<br />around the world so quickly was that</i>
1670269 1671896 you don't even need dialogue.
1672004 1674689 I mean, you just see the situation there,
1674756 1680638 and your own primal fear about<br />something you can't see into
1681230 1683665 is enough to hold your<br />interest in that movie.
1683916 1685862 It's a universal movie.
1685951 1690320 Not just Universal Studios,<br />but it really has a global impact.
1690656 1692875 <i>I really think it<br />works like a silent movie.</i>
1693192 1695126 <i>You're responding to the visuals</i>
1695227 1697127 <i>instinctively and in a visceral</i> way.
1699565 1704776 The coincidence of that, plus<br />Steven's innate talent as a filmmaker,
1705053 1706987 made a film that will live.
1707055 1708500 It has to live.
1708774 1711573 It's not going away anywhere.
1711677 1714305 There's no culture on Earth that<br />does not have that film and show it.
1715681 1719584 <i>It was shown in 40<br />countries in 17 different languages.</i>
1720435 1725589 <i>If you forgot what terror is<br />like, the original Jaws is back.</i>
1728427 1730737 <i>And then there<br />was the merchandising blitz.</i>
1731280 1734523 <i>Almost overnight, Jaws<br />became a cottage industry.</i>
1734700 1737635 <i>And suddenly sharks meant big business.</i>
1739721 1745387 <i>When we realized what we<br />had, Merchandising was licking their lips,</i>
1745460 1749488 <i>and it just was such an<br />easy one to merchandise.</i>
1749765 1753668 <i>It started obviously with what<br />everybody does with the T-shirts,</i>
1753735 1755282 <i>but it went from there.</i>
1755387 1759915 <i>Everything kind of mushroomed<br />with the release of the picture.</i>
1760475 1763251 I even had a toilet seat,
1763362 1767048 that when you open it up, it<br />was a big shark facing you.
1767115 1772269 <i>So, everything, lunch<br />pails to barbeque setsâ€¦</i>
1772371 1774396 <i>It was incredible,</i>
1774573 1779477 <i>and one of the first<br />big merchandising events</i>
1779578 1782479 <i>to take place in<br />connection with the movie.</i>
1783532 1785728 <i>Though three decades have come and gone</i>
1785801 1787951 <i>since the Jaws merchandising frenzy,</i>
1788420 1792903 <i>for some voracious collectors,<br />the summer of the shark never ends.</i>
1808674 1809937 <i>In recent years,</i>
1810042 1812670 <i>the picture's enduring popularity has seen</i>
1812778 1815406 <i>a resurgence of<br />Jaws-related paraphernalia,</i>
1815931 1819515 <i>from children's toys,<br />to high-end collectibles,</i>
1821086 1822144 <i>to video games.</i>
1829261 1832162 <i>Another milestone in the<br />evolution of entertainment</i>
1832280 1835432 <i>was the commercialization<br />of the making of Jaws.</i>
1835534 1837116 <i>Though commonplace today,</i>
1837185 1840428 <i>capitalizing on a picture's<br />behind-the-scenes accounts</i>
1840539 1843588 <i>was rarely, if ever, seen in the mid-'70s.</i>
1844026 1845585 I'd always been interested in movies
1845660 1849369 as something more than just sitting<br />there and passively observing them.
1849548 1853712 <i>The Jaws Log, by Carl<br />Gottlieb, and Edith Blake's book</i>
1853819 1855253 <i>called</i> The Making of the Movie Jaws.
1855354 1859973 <i>Both of those were inspiration<br />for making me interested in films.</i>
1860042 1862454 Jaws as a film to me
1862561 1865303 is first of all, my favorite<br />film. I watch it once a year.
1865564 1868340 And when you examine the film<br />in its finished state,
1868417 1870408 and you look at the process<br />of making the film,
1870502 1872834 and you read Carl Gottlieb's Jaws <i>Log,</i>
1872938 1874417 <i>or you just read the other histories,</i>
1874506 1876622 <i>or as I remember reading<br />about it even as a kid,</i>
1876842 1879152 <i>it's almost like film school in a movie.</i>
1879261 1880422 I remember in film school reading
1880512 1881570 an interview with Steven Soderbergh,
1881680 1883728 who said that he was Jaws-obsessed,
1883799 1885381 and that his favorite<br />book was The <i>Jaws</i> Log
1885484 1887009 <i>and that he carried it<br />with him everywhere.</i>
1887119 1889554 And I thought,<br />"Okay, I'm on the right track."
1889638 1893791 That book became my Bible, and I<br />read that book over and over and over.
1894393 1897237 <i>In the beginning,<br />when the book was first conceived,</i>
1897496 1901478 it was kind of a hasty<br />afterthought to the marketing plan.
1901550 1904497 The original intent was for<br />there to be a three-parter.
1904653 1906235 The book would be written
1906338 1909399 from Steven Spielberg's point of<br />view, he would contribute a third,
1909508 1911875 <i>from Peter Benchley's view,<br />he would contribute a third,</i>
1911977 1914776 <i>and Zanuck and Brown would<br />contribute a third as producers.</i>
1915263 1917709 <i>And as we got closer and<br />closer to the release date,</i>
1917816 1920228 it became evident that nobody<br />was gonna be able to write their third.
1920302 1922145 I had already agreed with Steven
1922254 1926418 to kind of ghostwrite or author<br />his third of it from what I knew,
1926525 1928766 'cause we had shared a house and I knew
1928844 1931085 what Steven's perspective<br />on the movie was.
1931480 1933380 So then nobody was available.
1933732 1935894 <i>Steven was immersed in post-production.</i>
1936001 1938470 <i>Zanuck and Brown were onto something else.</i>
1938637 1942164 <i>So they said to me at the end of March,</i>
1942274 1946268 <i>"Can you do a book by the end of<br />May?" And with the folly of youth,</i>
1946378 1948745 <i>I said, "Yeah, I can<br />write a book that quickly."</i>
1948847 1951179 <i>So I wrote the book in a very short time.</i>
1951283 1952717 <i>Probably less than a month.</i>
1952818 1955810 <i>And the original paperback<br />got favorable reviews.</i>
1956071 1957903 <i>And the word of mouth was terrific,</i>
1957973 1959714 <i>and the book went through 17 printings</i>
1959825 1961600 <i>and sold a couple of million copies.</i>
1963411 1964810 <i>And then of course, many years later,</i>
1964880 1967872 <i>Laurent Bouzereau did his<br />behind-the scenes documentary</i>
1967949 1969348 <i>on the same subject matter.</i>
1969985 1972295 <i>Universal came out with what<br />they called the Signature series</i>
1972404 1973712 <i>back in the LaserDisc days.</i>
1974306 1978937 And the Jaws box set that included<br />the Laurent Bouzereau documentary
1979044 1982014 was something that every<br />Jaws fan just had to have.
1982097 1983747 They went out and bought LaserDisc players
1983849 1985465 just so they could have that documentary.
1985534 1989562 <i>When I got to the<br />Jaws documentary for the LaserDisc,</i>
1989638 1996123 I felt that I'm gonna try to do a<br />Bible or some kind of a reference
1996228 1999664 to that particular movie.<br />Because how many times
1999748 2002911 <i>do we get to sit across Steven<br />Spielberg or Peter Benchley</i>
2002984 2004668 <i>and the cast members, but you want to get</i>
2004753 2006403 <i>all of their different perspectives.</i>
2006505 2008030 <i>And I think for the true fans,</i>
2008123 2009955 <i>you're just looking at those people</i>
2010025 2011754 <i>as if they were talking to you.</i>
2012727 2017289 <i>I had seen all those pictures of<br />Brody's son in the arms of the stuntman,</i>
2017449 2019144 and I always wondered like,<br />"That's not even in the movie."
2019251 2022027 And yet that picture was<br />used to promote the picture.
2022454 2026618 And I was always wondering, "What<br />is that sequence? What is that scene?"
2026725 2028819 <i>And finding the footage<br />of that was amazing.</i>
2030946 2035474 <i>Seeing that when the shark<br />comes into the estuary, it's just a fin.</i>
2036101 2037296 <i>I thought that was pretty amazing.</i>
2039688 2042271 <i>Finding that footage of<br />the building of the shark,</i>
2042374 2045685 <i>doing all the tests, dry,</i>
2045860 2048227 <i>and then getting the big surprise<br />that it doesn't work in water,</i>
2048313 2049428 I mean, it was just amazing.
2049497 2055163 I felt like I was doing what I<br />had been sent on Earth to do.
2055287 2059269 To discover all that stuff and<br />to make sure it was preserved.
2059341 2061753 Because a lot of it, I think that
2061860 2064238 if there had not been DVDs today,
2064329 2067139 I think a lot of that<br />stuff would be totally lost.
2069784 2073550 <i>Always an important step<br />in advancing public awareness of a movie,</i>
2073622 2077820 <i>both during and after its theatrical<br />run, is the film's poster design.</i>
2078510 2080251 <i>And in the case of Jaws,</i>
2080345 2084407 <i>few images have become more<br />emblazoned on pop culture than this one.</i>
2085684 2088301 <i>That image is iconic and was responsible</i>
2088370 2091783 <i>for getting a lot of people<br />into the theaters to see Jaws.</i>
2091890 2094473 What kid wouldn't wanna go see that movie?
2094542 2097159 It's almost like a bullet<br />before it hits somebody.
2097262 2099492 <i>And the fact that it leaves<br />it all to your imagination</i>
2099598 2102693 <i>is why the poster of Jaws did so well.</i>
2103451 2110073 It conveyed all the emotion<br />that is aroused by the fear.
2110175 2113270 And you just got it. The minute<br />you look at that image, you got it.
2114663 2117906 <i>Jaws' poster is the Bible of how to do it.</i>
2118016 2120758 That's all you need to know.
2120835 2123327 You don't need to know about<br />the main characters and their arcs
2123405 2124622 or anything like that.
2124723 2128159 Big shark, pretty girl, bad situation.
2128243 2130519 One of the things that happens<br />when you do an iconic film
2130629 2133724 is it becomes a touchstone for<br />other artists and other comments.
2134215 2137446 <i>The Jaws artwork became an element</i>
2137519 2139681 <i>of political cartoons for years.</i>
2142791 2144691 <i>In fact, the shark and swimmer</i>
2144776 2146619 <i>were used to represent virtually</i>
2146695 2148493 <i>every issue in the political spectrum.</i>
2162977 2165924 <i>And it wasn't just politics<br />getting in on the action.</i>
2166031 2168079 <i>Over the years, even up to this day,</i>
2168149 2170834 <i>the Jaws motif has served as fodder</i>
2170919 2173547 <i>for a variety of more<br />off-beat applications.</i>
2185617 2188416 <i>But what today has<br />become a pop culture icon,</i>
2188520 2191046 <i>actually had very humble beginnings.</i>
2192157 2197106 <i>The art of the swimmer<br />swimming above the great white shark</i>
2197746 2200477 <i>originated on the cover of the paperback</i>
2200548 2203210 <i>edition of Peter Benchley's novel,</i> Jaws,
2203284 2204695 published by Bantam Books,
2204803 2208387 and Oscar Dystel, who was<br />the chairman of the company,
2208707 2212439 always regretted that he<br />didn't putâ€¦ He didn't sell it to us.
2212544 2214694 He could've sold us the artwork.
2214763 2217539 <i>But he gave it to us as a publicity thing.</i>
2217649 2220118 <i>So I kid him about it to this day.</i>
2221603 2224971 <i>One name that is not as<br />well known in the annals of Jaws history</i>
2225039 2229658 <i>is Roger Kastel, the artist who<br />created the legendary image.</i>
2230128 2232438 <i>Kastel was a seasoned paperback</i>
2232514 2234812 <i>and magazine illustrator<br />working in New York</i>
2234883 2237784 <i>whose skills were increasingly<br />in demand at the time.</i>
2237986 2241354 <i>And the assignment<br />was simply one among many.</i>
2241423 2245883 Oscar Dystel said, "Have<br />I got a great book for you!
2245960 2248873 "You'll love it. You can<br />read it over the weekend."
2248963 2251113 <i>They felt the hardcover version</i>
2251216 2253275 <i>wouldn't work on the paperback.</i>
2253368 2257532 <i>I did a very rough sketch<br />and they said, "That's great.</i>
2257639 2262691 "Just make the shark realistic and<br />bigger. Make him very much bigger."
2263161 2268372 <i>I had gone to the Museum of Natural<br />History, and I had my camera with me</i>
2268500 2272550 <i>and I said, "Do you have a<br />shark exhibit in the building?"</i>
2272720 2278386 <i>And she said, "Yes, they do." But it<br />was all down and they were refurbishing.</i>
2278460 2280588 <i>They were cleaning them.</i>
2280662 2285941 All the sharks were laying on easels.
2286034 2291666 They were plaster. And<br />so, I had my camera with me.
2291890 2295155 <i>Well, I knew what position<br />I wanted the shark in,</i>
2295260 2300164 <i>and this is the great white that<br />they had laying on a easel beingâ€¦</i>
2300265 2304930 <i>I guess they were dusting it.<br />And that's what I worked from.</i>
2305954 2310937 <i>The girl was photographed<br />in the studio in New York.</i>
2312227 2316494 <i>She was a great model. I used her<br />for</i> a <i>Good Housekeeping painting</i>
2316581 2320017 <i>and asked if she would stay<br />another half hour</i>
2320118 2324396 and just swim for this<br />paperback. I told her it was Jaws.
2324973 2327499 I don't think anyone knew<br />what Jaws was then.
2328042 2330955 But she was swimming on a stool.
2331763 2334277 <i>Last summer, I was painting in the studio</i>
2334349 2336829 <i>and my grandson, Luke, came in.</i>
2336935 2342521 And he says, "Grandpa, did you<br />ever do a Mona Lisa?"And he's seven.
2342891 2346304 <i>And that really threw me.<br />And I thought and I said,</i>
2346411 2349255 <i>"I don't think I've done<br />the Mona</i> Lisa, <i>Luke."</i>
2349330 2354166 And he said, "Well, the shark<br />will just have to be your Mona Lisa."
2374589 2375589 I can'tâ€¦
2377225 2379319 Did I say it right?
2384983 2386360 The theme song of Jaws.
2386451 2388078 That's the first impression<br />that comes to my mind.
2388152 2390246 <i>And it just sticks in there.<br />You know what I mean?</i>
2394676 2397088 I think <i>Jaws</i> was the first film that I did
2397161 2398993 where I was really crazy about the film.
2399063 2400713 <i>I thought it was a marvelous film.</i>
2402200 2403725 <i>I remember the first day I played,</i>
2403801 2405200 <i>Steven said, "What do<br />we do for the shark?"</i>
2405270 2407204 And I just played<br />an octave E on the piano,
2407272 2409115 and then E and an F and repeated them
2409207 2410902 and accelerated them and so on.
2410992 2412642 And he said something like,<br />"You think that'll work."
2412727 2414104 "You gotta be kidding.<br />It's so simple."
2414178 2416590 All he did wasâ€¦
2416698 2418109 And Steven said, "That's all?"
2418182 2420173 And John said, "Yeah, that's it."
2420919 2422751 <i>Well, I think, John, who's prescient</i>
2422820 2424652 <i>about all the movies he scores,</i>
2424806 2428015 <i>he sees deeper than we do<br />about our own work.</i>
2428610 2431853 <i>And I think he saw something<br />deeply primal about Jaws,</i>
2431930 2436140 and he decided that it<br />needed a primal response.
2436234 2440819 It needed a primal sound.<br />Something that was atavistic.
2440922 2443766 Something that was extremely basic.
2443841 2445559 And something that was unforgettable
2445660 2449563 and would be almost a kind of a siren
2449664 2451883 to warn you that something<br />was coming to get you.
2452050 2456578 When you associate the image<br />of that shark coming in for the kill,
2456788 2459473 and you hear that John Williams score,
2461492 2464723 It's that perfect storm again.
2464796 2467527 It's the right image for the right music.
2467598 2470226 It doesn't happen all the time.
2470902 2476113 <i>But, boy, when it does, you never<br />forget it for generations, obviously.</i>
2478543 2483709 <i>The Jaws theme was so<br />provocative and symbolic of the shark</i>
2484248 2487343 that he saved us, really, because
2487435 2490086 the many times that<br />we didn't have the shark,
2490154 2495251 all we had to do was point the<br />camera out to sea and play his score
2495443 2496820 and everybody screamed.
2496894 2499443 And for half the film you don't<br />see the shark. You don't have to.
2499731 2501722 You hear that theme and it puts it,
2501816 2503534 "Oh, my God, he's out there somewhere
2503634 2504829 <i>"and he's gonna get somebody."</i>
2504902 2507314 <i>I just think it was<br />the most brilliant couple of notes</i>
2507422 2510619 <i>that he's ever written, because<br />it's lived beyond the movie.</i>
2510892 2512371 <i>And it's become the thing</i>
2512460 2515737 <i>that kids do with each other<br />when they're playing in the pool.</i>
2515947 2518575 You can always creep up on<br />somebody and goâ€¦
2518649 2522210 And in the post-Jaws world,<br />it means something.
2522387 2525971 In Australia, they use the shark theme
2526074 2529806 as a warning sound on the beaches.
2529911 2531754 I love that in the loudspeakers.
2534382 2539479 "I'm outta here!" No one would stay<br />in the water listening to that music.
2539570 2542722 Every movie after that, whenever<br />you saw any kind of a monster beast,
2542824 2545771 especially sea stuff like a<br />shark, octopus, whatever,
2545927 2547975 it was like the poundingâ€¦
2549947 2551494 Don't!
2552417 2553417 Don't!
2555253 2556516 That song gives me the creeps.
2556587 2558772 What do you mean, it's our theme song.
2558873 2563151 It's very flattering. You think,<br />"Oh, great, whatever I've written
2563227 2567642 "has made it to that level." That's<br />one reaction that I think is natural.
2567749 2569797 <i>I'm always pleased about it.</i>
2569884 2573070 <i>The fact that it gets up off the<br />paper into the orchestra's hands,</i>
2573154 2575236 <i>out through the microphone<br />and around the world,</i>
2575523 2578015 back into my own living room,<br />which is my own studio,
2578126 2580743 where I'll be working<br />sometimes years later,
2580812 2584806 it's quite a miraculous electronic trip
2584899 2587209 that composers in preceding centuries
2587285 2590619 would never have had<br />the pleasure of experiencing,
2590772 2594333 so we're lucky that<br />film and recorded music
2594442 2596809 and so on has the reach that it does.
2603151 2605142 <i>While the digital effects revolution,</i>
2605236 2607204 <i>which took hold in the early '90s,</i>
2607405 2610989 <i>promised to offer filmmakers<br />tremendous creative freedom,</i>
2611058 2613527 <i>the legacy of Jaws reminds us that</i>
2613594 2615403 <i>being unable to show everything you want</i>
2615580 2617571 <i>really can be a blessing in disguise.</i>
2620885 2624571 <i>We've complained about<br />the shark not being able to perform.</i>
2624639 2627256 <i>Because it couldn't.<br />It was never ready.</i>
2627341 2632051 That was what saved us.<br />That was the artistry of the film.
2632497 2636525 <i>If Jaws never<br />existed, except in the year 2005,</i>
2636801 2638747 I would have had the digital tools
2638820 2641767 to have much more of<br />the shark in the movie.
2641873 2645082 Therefore, I would have ruined<br />much more of the movie.
2645343 2648358 Had we been able to computerize the shark,
2648913 2652360 a lot of the wonderful elements<br />of the picture, like the barrels,
2652817 2654342 <i>would never have been thought of.</i>
2654819 2659131 That was an idea that<br />came during the production
2659207 2661687 and out of frustration<br />of not having the shark,
2661776 2664188 we didn't have anything else to shoot.
2666414 2670044 <i>In the very first scene, with the<br />girl being pulled back and forth,</i>
2670117 2674532 <i>the shark was supposed to<br />be there in the picture that time.</i>
2674639 2678200 <i>We only showed it later,<br />because we didn't have it earlier.</i>
2682213 2686764 <i>They began Jaws in<br />the opening scene by not seeing the shark.</i>
2687034 2690595 And I think it was more terrifying.
2690805 2694537 Not seeing something, I<br />really believe, is more terrifying
2694609 2697192 <i>'cause visually, you're all right with it.</i>
2697295 2699923 <i>But if your imagination runs wild,</i>
2700398 2702230 <i>then it can be anything.</i>
2708940 2711875 Oh, God, help!
2712577 2715046 <i>I did that because<br />the shark kept breaking down.</i>
2715680 2717774 <i>And today, a visual shark<br />would not break down.</i>
2717882 2720476 There'd be some nice<br />interactive water explosions
2720585 2722633 to marry the digital shark<br />with the actual water.
2722703 2725832 That's all it would be. There would<br />not have been a full-size shark.
2726173 2731521 <i>Or probably even any segment<br />of the shark in a 2005 Jaws today.</i>
2731629 2734428 <i>And therefore, the film would<br />have been only half as effective.</i>
2734532 2739698 <i>So I was saved by the breakdown<br />in technology 30 years ago.</i>
2742173 2744221 I think if I'm correct about this,
2744292 2746659 it was 55 minutes into the movie
2746727 2748855 before you actually saw the shark.
2754201 2756499 <i>One of the things that<br />makes the picture more believable</i>
2756570 2759915 is that you can't do many<br />things with that shark.
2760574 2761973 <i>You have one shark that goes right,</i>
2762043 2764341 <i>one that goes left, and<br />one that goes straight ahead.</i>
2764412 2766779 <i>Almost made it more believable.</i>
2766998 2769080 <i>Because you couldn't do<br />any fancy stuff with it.</i>
2769150 2771414 And I can't help but<br />think that filmmakers today
2771485 2773431 would wanna do a lot more with that shark.
2773521 2778083 In today's movies, everybody's<br />trying to top themselves,
2778159 2779422 and they're trying to top others
2779493 2781541 and they're just trying<br />to do it bigger and better,
2781646 2784422 and sometimes, bigger<br />isn't better necessarily.
2784649 2786276 Sometimes, bigger is too much.
2786384 2790184 It's hard to create something<br />new that surprises people.
2790288 2792450 In this day and age,<br />they've seen so much already.
2792540 2793905 There's so many movies now.
2793975 2795022 <i>What's great about that, I think,</i>
2795126 2796924 <i>the expectations for what a movie</i>
2797028 2798757 <i>could be weren't what they are today.</i>
2798863 2803391 <i>So when a great movie like that came<br />out back then, it just floored people.</i>
2808306 2812459 I cannot tell you how many<br />people have come to me and said,
2812526 2816144 "Because of Jaws, I will not<br />go in the water to this day."
2816514 2817514 It is staggering.
2817932 2819559 Come on in the water!
2819717 2821458 Take it easy.
2821719 2823585 I mean, <i>Jaws</i> essentially did for swimming
2823688 2826407 what the movie Psycho did<br />for showering in motel rooms.
2826474 2828420 <i>The shower scene in Psycho,</i>
2828526 2831427 <i>where women especially<br />weren't taking showers,</i>
2831629 2834530 I didn't go in the ocean after <i>Jaws.</i>
2834632 2837146 I was at the beach one day<br />and a woman came over to me,
2837218 2840381 and she had her little child in hand.
2840488 2842820 He was about five years old,<br />and he was crying.
2843290 2845759 And she said, "Are you Steven Spielberg?"
2845826 2847954 And I said, "Yes, I am."
2848079 2851162 And she began screaming at me<br />with a very thick New York accent.
2851232 2855032 "You tell him, you tell him<br />it's safe to go out there.
2855119 2857065 "You tell him it's safe to go out there.
2857138 2859038 "Look at him, look what<br />you've done to him."
2859123 2862036 And this kid was crying his eyes<br />out. And I said, "What happened?"
2862126 2863821 She said, "My husband showed him <i>Jaws</i>
2863928 2865612 "and now look, he won't go into the water.
2865730 2868097 "You tell him it's okay. You<br />tell him it's all make-believe."
2868199 2871817 And she gave me such a piece<br />of her mind, I sat the boy down,
2871886 2873718 I looked him in the eye,<br />and I couldn't lie to him,
2873788 2875005 it is dangerous out there.
2875106 2879304 I couldn't just say to him, "Yes, go<br />out there, go out beyond the waves."
2879593 2881470 It's all psychological.
2881579 2885425 You yell, "Barracuda!" and<br />everybody says, "Huh? What?"
2887334 2889211 You yell, "Shark!"
2890388 2893517 We've got a panic on our<br />hands on the Fourth of July.
2904602 2907845 <i>The structure of Jaws is just so perfect.</i>
2907922 2910016 <i>It just breaks up into<br />these beautiful acts.</i>
2910091 2913504 And it's like problem, finding the answer,
2913611 2916888 and then the third act of,<br />"We're gonna go get the shark."
2917081 2919982 <i>It's such a beautiful,<br />mythological structure.</i>
2920084 2922451 <i>Is this monster about things in them?</i>
2923421 2924889 Ain't got no spit.
2926891 2929588 As all great storytelling<br />is that the characters
2929677 2931236 learn something about themselves,
2931312 2934725 their phobias, the things<br />that they're lacking.
2935216 2938481 Why are they chasing<br />this thing, the white whale?
2939587 2942318 <i>It's Melville, it's Hemingway,</i>
2942389 2944881 <i>it's the ancient prophet, Jonah.</i>
2944959 2947803 <i>These are the mythological parallels</i>
2947912 2950859 that bubble up from below<br />the surface in Jaws
2950931 2953081 that make it a timeless classic,
2953184 2957872 that make it last long after the<br />technological aspects of the film
2957938 2959349 are old hat.
2959457 2963269 <i>It's a very classic,<br />hero's journey kind of a story.</i>
2963344 2968077 <i>If you subscribe to the<br />mythmaking nature of screenwriting,</i>
2968199 2972249 it has all the ingredients that are not
2972319 2975311 culturally specific<br />to a generation's views.
2975473 2979159 It's not Depression-America,<br />it's not Vietnam-America.
2979360 2986016 <i>It's a little timeless island with only<br />the human values of fear, jealousy,</i>
2986100 2988967 <i>or heroism or shark obsession.</i>
2989253 2991563 Part of what succeeds about <i>Jaws</i>
2991639 2994108 is the simplicity of<br />the way the story was told.
2994542 2996533 <i>And the fact that it's<br />just three men and a boat,</i>
2996644 2998590 <i>when you come right down to it,</i>
2998696 3002792 <i>three survivors who all have<br />problems with each other.</i>
3004535 3006481 You got city hands,<br />Mr. Hooper.
3006554 3008454 You been counting money all your life.
3008556 3012015 I don't need this. I don't need<br />this working-class-hero crap.
3012092 3014606 They have huge, personal<br />issues with each other.
3014712 3017556 But those are all cast aside as<br />they have to become partners
3017648 3019594 in order to help each other live
3019667 3021567 and get through the experience.
3021652 3026055 And the shark becomes less<br />important than those three characters.
3026140 3028256 <i>And I have to give Peter<br />Benchley total credit for that.</i>
3028359 3029359 <i>That was in the book.</i>
3029677 3032772 <i>The characters in<br />Jaws are composites. All of them are.</i>
3032997 3036058 I, in Jaws, am two people.
3036150 3038983 I am Hooper from the<br />environmental point of view,
3039053 3040350 <i>I am the guy who says,</i>
3040421 3042799 <i>"He doesn't wanna hurt you,<br />he just wants to eat you."</i>
3042907 3045786 <i>On the other hand, I'm<br />also the character of Brody,</i>
3045859 3048885 in that every book I've written<br />has been an everyman kind of book,
3048963 3054549 of what would happen if a normal<br />Joe gets himself into a position
3054919 3057286 that is way beyond his capacity to handle.
3057388 3059755 And here's Brody who doesn't swim,
3060241 3062084 <i>who's never been in the ocean in his life,</i>
3062176 3063974 <i>who's a retired New York City policeman,</i>
3064078 3066376 <i>who's out in the boondocks and suddenly,</i>
3066447 3068779 <i>he's cast into having to be a seaman.</i>
3069033 3070865 <i>This is ridiculous.</i>
3071235 3075820 After watching a stumblebum like Brody
3075889 3078881 save his neck by just doing
3078993 3081462 what almost anybody would<br />do in that situation,
3081579 3083775 <i>you get a gun, you get out of the boat,</i>
3083881 3086043 <i>you try to save yourself,<br />you get up on the mast,</i>
3086150 3088892 <i>you shoot the thing.<br />You do what you have to do.</i>
3089320 3092517 <i>So much so that you<br />feel like you have done it.</i>
3092623 3094671 <i>Everybody sitting in the audience did it,</i>
3094742 3096756 <i>because I certainly did not show</i>
3096844 3100439 any courageous aspect<br />of myself up till that point.
3100648 3102798 And the characters drive you so forward
3102900 3106427 that by the time the<br />shark is flapping its mouth,
3106537 3107800 jumping onto the boat,
3108372 3110022 all you can think of is, "Quint,
3110090 3111706 "get your feet away from its mouth.
3112026 3114859 "Just kick it. Get it away.<br />Stab it, get it away.
3114928 3118444 "Oh, no, no,<br />no, no, no. Ah! Shit!"
3120718 3123187 <i>You've got the<br />family unit in the first half of the film,</i>
3123304 3127241 where Brody has a very, very<br />personable family that you just,
3127308 3129140 right away you love them when<br />they wake up in the morning,
3129209 3130233 and you're there with them.
3130411 3134393 They're in the "yard,"<br />not too "far" from the "car."
3137151 3138346 How's that?
3138419 3139534 Like you're from New York.
3139637 3143904 I always said that the characters in<br />the movie reminded me of relatives.
3144008 3146272 That's howâ€¦ I felt I knew them.
3146377 3149256 He had such a great handle
3149330 3154951 on depicting suburban, middle<br />class, everyday American life.
3155052 3157953 And what he put up there<br />was almost documentary-like.
3158055 3159864 <i>I mean, it was just so real.</i>
3162876 3164344 <i>One of the things that Jaws did</i>
3164428 3166920 <i>that I wish movies still did more of</i>
3167031 3170808 is invade a community and<br />use actual locals in the movie.
3170884 3173546 <i>It brings the movie to<br />life in such a real</i> way.
3175823 3178087 <i>Islander, Lee Fierro, who portrayed</i>
3178158 3180354 <i>the grieving mother<br />of doomed Alex Kintner,</i>
3180527 3182291 <i>still lives on the Vineyard today.</i>
3182363 3185822 <i>Her now infamous confrontation<br />scene with Chief Martin Brody</i>
3185899 3189142 <i>has become a favorite sequence<br />among Jaws fans.</i>
3190170 3191251 Chief Brody?
3191305 3192352 Yes?
3193273 3195139 <i>It's been accurately recorded that</i>
3195209 3197109 <i>she had to slap the chief many, many times</i>
3197177 3199271 <i>in order to get just the right take.</i>
3200114 3203311 <i>Little did she know then that<br />her slapping days had just begun.</i>
3205319 3208732 <i>How many times<br />have I been asked to slap somebody?</i>
3210290 3213658 I've never counted them<br />and so I can't tell you.
3213844 3218190 But it happens a lot<br />and it is mostly young men.
3220384 3227233 I do it to please the fans, but<br />last year, I decided that is it.
3227307 3229776 I've slapped my last slap.
3231512 3234129 <i>Meeting Steve Spielberg<br />was a wonderful memory.</i>
3234398 3238346 He asked me if I could<br />improvise and I said, "Yes, I can."
3238419 3243186 And so we didâ€¦ Shari Rhodes,<br />the casting director, and I
3243257 3247785 improvised the beach scene,<br />but I had simply been told
3247878 3251041 <i>keep my son out of the water,<br />so that's what I was doing.</i>
3251365 3254266 And Steve stopped me and said, "Lee,
3256069 3259266 "you gotta let him go in the<br />water or we don't have a movie."
3261909 3266540 They had a raft that was cut in<br />half, and they take my raft away
3266613 3268331 and they put this half a raft over this.
3268432 3271026 It was like that round<br />that they filled up with blood
3271135 3273069 <i>and all this stuff. He goes,</i>
3273170 3275036 <i>"Now, lie on the half<br />a raft on top of this,</i>
3275139 3278552 <i>"it's gonna blow up. When<br />it blows up, go underwater</i>
3278826 3281454 "and stay under there as long as you can."
3281545 3284537 So you're 12 years old, lying<br />on this and they're saying,
3284631 3286565 <i>"It's full of blood." They're<br />saying, "It's gonna blow up."</i>
3286633 3289762 <i>And it's like I'm lying there and all<br />of a suddenâ€¦</i>
3289837 3291987 <i>This thing blows up, and there's blood</i>
3292089 3294137 <i>going up all over the place in your face</i>
3294208 3297109 <i>and I just went under water and I hear,</i>
3297211 3300374 "Cut. Okay, your leg was out<br />of the water," and they had toâ€¦
3301482 3304691 It took over an hour for all the<br />blood to clear out of the water
3304802 3306429 before they could do it again.
3306537 3309734 <i>I'd get to go inside one of<br />these warm little dressing rooms.</i>
3310007 3313056 <i>My friends were all freezing<br />cold outside, but I screwed up</i>
3313126 3315595 <i>so I get to go stay warm.</i>
3316597 3319840 <i>And after about four times of<br />doing this, they finally said, "No.</i>
3319967 3321844 <i>"We're gonna try this a different way."</i>
3322119 3323336 And if you noticed in the movie,
3323487 3326969 I go up and down 'cause these<br />guys in the wet suits startedâ€¦
3327040 3330271 They grabbed me and they were<br />pulling me under, lifting me up,
3330344 3332608 <i>and then they pulled me under<br />and gave me their air.</i>
3332880 3334757 And that's how they finally did it.
3334865 3338665 They gave up on a 12-year-old<br />kid trying to do it on his own.
3340838 3344888 <i>For the insert shot<br />needed of Bruce biting down on little Alex,</i>
3344975 3348605 <i>the dangers of interacting with<br />a multi-ton mechanical shark</i>
3348695 3352097 <i>required that Jeffrey be<br />replaced with a stunt double.</i>
3352165 3356580 <i>In this case, a common store<br />mannequin. And a female one at that.</i>
3357421 3360618 <i>It was to be one of the very<br />last shots done on the Vineyard.</i>
3361425 3364053 <i>Steven Spielberg had<br />already departed the island.</i>
3364161 3366004 <i>And filming was left in the capable hands</i>
3366079 3367956 <i>of Joe Alves in the second unit.</i>
3371285 3375483 <i>In true Jaws fashion, the scene<br />proved extremely difficult to coordinate.</i>
3376240 3378641 <i>But in the end, the shot<br />would provide audiences</i>
3378725 3382457 <i>with the now famous<br />frightening first glimpse of Bruce.</i>
3389836 3391031 Your folks were born here, right?
3391104 3392230 Yeah, I'm an Islander.
3392306 3394400 <i>Vineyard native, Jonathan Filley,</i>
3394474 3396568 <i>who played Tom Cassidy in the film,</i>
3396843 3398823 <i>parleyed his one and only acting job</i>
3398929 3402024 <i>into a solid career in the<br />motion picture industry.</i>
3402316 3404057 <i>I had done a lot of acting in high school</i>
3404151 3406415 <i>and really thought that I wanted<br />to pursue an acting career,</i>
3406486 3407783 <i>and there I was on the Vineyard</i>
3407854 3411472 <i>and saw an ad in the paper<br />that they wanted extras for Jaws.</i>
3411942 3413933 So I sent in a snapshot of me at the beach
3414044 3415842 the summer before with some friends,
3415946 3418916 and I think I circled that,<br />"That's me," and they cast me.
3420217 3422276 <i>There was so much stuff that<br />they didn't need that was shot.</i>
3422386 3424013 <i>I was in and out of the production</i>
3424121 3426089 <i>and around it quite a bit.<br />There's a piece in the picture</i>
3426173 3429222 <i>where this guy is<br />complaining to the chief that,</i>
3429326 3431226 <i>"Chief, the kids are<br />karate-chopping my fences,"</i>
3431328 3433774 <i>but, yeah, of course, they<br />didn't need the actual coverage</i>
3433880 3436144 <i>of the kids karate-chopping fences.</i>
3438251 3440765 <i>And what I really<br />cherish about this movie,</i>
3440871 3442384 <i>having grown up on Chappaquiddick,</i>
3442456 3444504 is that wonderful scene<br />where they come over
3444608 3446076 on the Chappaquiddick ferry
3446159 3448503 and the guy running the ferry<br />is this old fellow, Dick Huard,
3448612 3451206 <i>who passed away 15 years, 20 years ago.</i>
3451315 3453943 <i>And Dick was an integral part<br />of my childhood.</i>
3454051 3457828 And just seeing Dick, it<br />brings back so many memories.
3459156 3461625 <i>For some fans, no pilgrimage to Amity</i>
3461725 3463090 <i>is complete without looking up some</i>

3472185 3475746 Richard Dreyfuss yells at me,<br />"Ahoy, sloop, you got a paddle?"
3475822 3477096 And I say, "Yeah, I got a paddle."
3477274 3478274 You got a paddle on the boat?
3478291 3479291 I got a paddle.
3479443 3481184 And that was my one big line.
3481378 3483654 I quit, Mr. Quint. I quit.
3483747 3488958 <i>My part was Quint's<br />mate. There was a boat named</i> Skip Bucket
3489036 3491516 <i>that had all the camera crew<br />who were coming home.</i>
3491605 3495724 Spielberg says, "Will you do<br />me a favor?" And I said, "I'll try to."
3495826 3498136 And he says, "Will you take up<br />a speaking part with the dog?"
3498211 3499211 And I said, "Yes."
3499930 3502900 <i>So, I went to get cleaned up a little bit,</i>
3503000 3506049 <i>and they told me I had to get dirty again,</i>
3506136 3510369 so I couldn't shave anymore.
3511775 3513766 <i>I'm Henry Carreiro,</i>
3513944 3515685 <i>I was one of the two guys</i>
3515779 3517269 that claim we caught this tiger shark,
3517381 3519895 which was shot right on this spot.
3519966 3522594 And, of course, it turned out<br />to be the wrong shark.
3522703 3526219 <i>Right in this area, we had a<br />shark here hanging by the tail,</i>
3526323 3530874 <i>which was a real one that<br />we were told cost $10,000,</i>
3531228 3535028 <i>to have it caught off Florida<br />and flown up here special in a box.</i>
3535499 3537274 <i>And they called him Oscar.</i>
3537350 3539250 They got a lot of use out of that thing.
3539336 3540770 But the smell!
3541405 3543817 <i>That tiger shark really got ripe.</i>
3544708 3547917 <i>I didn't know who, Dick, my partner<br />was, till I met him that morning.</i>
3547994 3549234 <i>We hit it off very well.</i>
3549346 3552145 He's funny, he's a<br />character in his own right.
3552249 3555219 I immediately just clicked with this guy,
3555302 3559887 and we started cracking each<br />other up and making jokes.
3560207 3563518 Henry is a very, very quick<br />fellow. And he ad libs very well.
3563627 3565789 We played very well off of one another.
3565996 3568044 Gentlemen, the officer<br />asked me to tell you
3568115 3570106 that you're overloading that boat!
3570200 3571941 Go on, get out of here.
3572018 3574897 Dreyfuss, he said, "Where's a<br />good restaurant around here?"
3575005 3576063 Whatever his line was.
3576173 3578904 And I turned around and I<br />said, "Go straight ahead."
3579109 3581806 Big laugh,<br />right. Yeah. Yeah.
3581912 3583027 And he left it in.
3583213 3586399 Can you tell me if there's a good<br />restaurant or hotel on the island?
3586750 3588343 Yeah, you walk straight ahead.
3589569 3591219 They're all going to die.
3591404 3593873 <i>Spielberg said, "Just<br />say what comes into your head."</i>
3594024 3595753 You stuff your frigging<br />head in there, man,
3595859 3597554 and find out if it's a man-eater.
3598762 3600560 <i>We had this guy who did an article</i>
3600664 3602496 <i>in the local paper on Cape Cod.</i>
3602582 3604630 And he talked to Shari Rhodes and he said,
3604718 3608177 "Boy, you must have an<br />Abbott and Costello going here."
3608255 3610235 She says, "No, I just have two Costellos."
3610524 3611741 It's got a deep throat, Frank.
3611842 3613503 Yeah, but what kind?<br />What kind of shark?
3613577 3615204 Tiger shark.
3616947 3618108 A what?
3618582 3620482 <i>There's one guy<br />that pesters the hell out of me,</i>
3620584 3625169 every time he sees me, he walks<br />up behind me and says, "A what?"
3625255 3626734 That's probably going to be
3626807 3629526 <i>the most famous thing<br />I've ever said in my life.</i>
3629693 3630888 A what?
3631595 3634690 Mum, I got cut.<br />I got hit by a vampire.
3636133 3638431 <i>Then 12-year-old Chris Rebello,</i>
3638535 3640811 <i>who played Chief Brody's<br />elder son, Michael,</i>
3640904 3642133 <i>remained on the Vineyard</i>
3642239 3646142 <i>until his untimely passing from<br />a heart attack in the year 2000.</i>
3647444 3650880 <i>Chris was a friend.<br />We grew up together on the island.</i>
3651348 3653612 Working with Chris in the movie,
3653717 3657130 he was a brother,<br />another brother to my family.
3657204 3660686 <i>On set, we used to fool around and play,</i>
3660774 3663618 <i>sometimes Steven would say,<br />"Okay, that's enough.</i>
3663727 3666162 <i>"It's time to get back to<br />work. Let's do our thing."</i>
3666263 3669107 <i>And after the movie was done,<br />he didn't do any more acting.</i>
3669216 3670843 <i>He went on to work<br />for the Steamship Authority</i>
3670934 3672459 <i>with my brother, Tommy.</i>
3672569 3675311 And that's where he worked<br />until his passing.
3677841 3681209 <i>We really miss him.<br />We really miss him.</i>
3684848 3689058 <i>Perhaps no islander gained<br />more notoriety for his involvement in Jaws</i>
3689135 3691035 <i>than the late Craig Kings bury.</i>
3691872 3693601 <i>Craig's gruff and blustery demeanor</i>
3693673 3696392 <i>had made him a local legend<br />in his own right.</i>
3696493 3701192 <i>And his portrayal of fisherman Ben<br />Gardner, a favorite among Jaws fans.</i>
3701298 3706759 <i>They advertised for<br />some person who was a fisherman, a local,</i>
3707087 3709715 <i>who could help Robert Shaw<br />with his accent.</i>
3709789 3713771 <i>Robert was a refined British<br />actor until he met my father,</i>
3713877 3716471 <i>and then my father told him stories about</i>
3716580 3719140 <i>this island and the people that live here,</i>
3719432 3723300 and, unfortunately, I think<br />Robert Shaw believed them.
3723370 3726271 He fell hook, line and sinker,<br />and he began to repeat them.
3726356 3728267 <i>He was interviewed on the air,</i>
3728358 3730383 <i>telling these totally outrageous stories</i>
3730477 3731854 <i>about the local community.</i>
3731962 3733043 â€¦the rich people here.
3733113 3735389 There's a lot of skeletons in<br />the cupboard here, you know.
3735482 3737530 There's more incest going on<br />in Martha's Vineyard
3737634 3741286 than probably any state<br />in the United States.
3741371 3744898 They were mostly lies, which<br />is what my father was best at.
3745175 3747758 They'll wish their fathers<br />hadn't met their mothersâ€¦
3749346 3752407 My mother, when I took her<br />to see the movie in Boston,
3752499 3754547 we came out of the theater and she said,
3754651 3756665 <i>"That Spielberg, he's a genius.</i>
3756736 3760548 <i>"Finally, somebody has found a<br />use for your father's empty head."</i>
3761408 3765026 <i>Of course, Craig's most<br />memorable scene did involve his head,</i>
3765262 3766627 <i>but not the rest of him.</i>
3766730 3769028 <i>In fact, it didn't even<br />take place at the Vineyard.</i>
3769215 3772560 <i>Three thousand miles away<br />in Van Nuys, California,</i>
3772669 3775195 <i>Spielberg resourcefully created that</i>
3775305 3777831 <i>most shocking moment as an insert shot,</i>
3778041 3781204 <i>and he used little more than<br />a foam life-cast of Kings bury</i>
3781311 3782642 <i>and a swimming pool.</i>
3782946 3785643 <i>Steven had just<br />come from the answer print with Verna</i>
3785749 3787899 at Universal and had signed off on it,
3787968 3790551 and here we were on that very eve,
3790654 3794454 doing an extra shot that we were<br />gonna try to get in the next day.
3794541 3796316 That scene had already been shot.
3796493 3798655 <i>But it wasn't done to shock the audience,</i>
3798762 3800105 <i>and so I went to Verna Fields',</i>
3800180 3801454 <i>my film editor's swimming pool,</i>
3801548 3803448 borrowed her pool,<br />'cause I didn't have one,
3803516 3805541 I didn't have enough money to<br />have a swimming pool in those days,
3805618 3807029 because <i>Jaws</i> hadn't come out yet,
3807137 3808514 and I was a poor director then.
3808672 3811403 We had a small replica of a hull
3811508 3813840 that I put together<br />in Joe Alves' driveway.
3813927 3816305 <i>And I basically held my breath underwater</i>
3816413 3819474 and put the head of Ben<br />Gardner through that hull
3819566 3821978 when Frankie Sparks came up<br />with the flashlight.
3826456 3830199 <i>I remember, I timed it<br />to get maximum shock effect.</i>
3835098 3837157 <i>This is the pool where Steven Spielberg</i>
3837267 3839326 <i>filmed the Ben Gardner sequence.</i>
3839436 3841154 And that was done right here.<br />Very famous.
3841221 3844236 Scary. Scary moment.
3844341 3846867 <i>What was the most<br />satisfying edit you did in</i> Jaws?
3846960 3849440 The most satisfying edit, I have to say,
3849546 3851594 was the face coming out of the boat.
3851664 3853154 Because when I went to that preview,
3853233 3855884 and that audience just<br />went six feet off their seats
3855969 3860623 and let out this incredible<br />scream, that was really satisfying.
3860724 3864433 When we found this place, it was<br />still full of her reels just sitting there,
3864511 3867412 <i>but it was amazing treasure to find.</i>
3868932 3871663 These are some footlockers<br />that we found at the house.
3871768 3875204 These came back from Martha's<br />Vineyard, from the shoot there,
3875305 3879105 and as you can see, "Verna<br />Fields, editorial <i>Jaws, "</i>
3879209 3881007 on the cover of this one.
3881111 3883637 And inside, there are several film reels
3883747 3887308 of Verna's work still<br />kept in these boxes here.
3887417 3890682 This is full of different<br />films that she made.
3891871 3893999 Yeah, she had set up<br />her editing facility here
3894074 3897806 <i>and edited all of her films<br />in this building right here.</i>
3897911 3900380 <i>It's kind of cool<br />that this humble, simple room</i>
3900447 3903974 <i>is where one of the greatest<br />movies ever was put together.</i>
3904968 3905968 What are we looking for?
3906069 3907764 We're looking for a nice place to show
3907871 3910533 that Quint refuses to slow down the boat.
3912025 3917680 And here we have the Moviola<br />that Verna Fields used to edit Jaws.
3917781 3921558 Every second of the Jaws film<br />passed through this machine
3921634 3924353 by the hands of Verna Fields.<br />That's special.
3924454 3928413 Doesn't look very pretty now,<br />but maybe someday, it will again.
3929793 3931511 <i>Verna and I worked in her pool house</i>
3931578 3934354 <i>shoulder to shoulder for a<br />long time on that Moviola.</i>
3934481 3937940 And Verna did a great job<br />with her biorhythms.
3938017 3942796 Creating a biorhythm for Jaws that<br />was just the right kind of tautness,
3942906 3945750 like a violin string to play<br />a very, very high note.
3948645 3950443 It can't take that much pressure.
3953183 3954491 That's the spot, Steve.
3959088 3961534 <i>My husband tells me you're in sharks.</i>
3964344 3967655 Excuse me. Yes. I've never<br />heard it quite put that way.
3967730 3969141 But yes, I am.
3969549 3970710 I love sharks.
3971151 3972459 <i>Yeah, I love them.</i>
3974003 3977769 <i>I think the fascination<br />with sharks comes from many things.</i>
3977841 3981402 <i>One, they are the last surviving predator</i>
3981478 3983503 <i>that poses a genuine threat to man</i>
3983580 3986561 <i>in an environment<br />in which he chooses to go.</i>
3988635 3992219 E. O. Wilson said, "We<br />don't just fear our predators,
3992305 3994023 "we are transfixed by them."
3994574 3996838 <i>Prone to weave stories and fables</i>
3996943 4002109 <i>because fascination breeds<br />preparedness, and preparedness, survival.</i>
4002215 4006402 <i>In a deeply tribal sense, he<br />said, "We love our monsters."</i>
4008488 4013221 <i>I believe that worldwide, young<br />children, all male children at least,</i>
4013326 4016193 <i>have a fascination with<br />either sharks or dinosaurs.</i>
4016296 4017878 Very big shark.
4018047 4020823 <i>And in my case, I was<br />able to grow up around here</i>
4020934 4023960 <i>in Nantucket where<br />sharks were in proliferation.</i>
4024053 4027421 <i>So I was able to fix my<br />fascination on sharks.</i>
4030777 4033462 <i>One couple whose fixed fascination</i>
4033530 4037194 <i>led to their preeminence in the<br />field of great white shark research</i>
4037267 4041534 <i>was husband and wife team<br />Ron and Valerie Taylor of Australia.</i>
4041704 4045106 <i>Their combined experience<br />throughout the '60s and '70s</i>
4045174 4047688 <i>documenting these elusive animals</i>
4047794 4051128 <i>made them the perfect fit<br />for the Jaws creative team.</i>
4051231 4054007 <i>They were commissioned<br />to shoot live shark footage</i>
4054083 4057428 <i>for the picture's climactic cage sequence.</i>
4057537 4060063 <i>The assignment would prove<br />to be almost as harrowing</i>
4060173 4061720 <i>as anything in the film itself.</i>
4062909 4064399 <i>I told them that there's a problem,</i>
4064494 4068806 because our sharks on average<br />are only about 13 feet in length,
4068915 4072328 and yet your mechanical shark<br />is 26 feet in length.
4072402 4074018 And they said, "Well, there's no problem.
4074103 4077915 "We'll send you a small man<br />and small cages."
4078107 4083625 We built a scaled down cage, and<br />we tried a dummy and that didn't work,
4083730 4088725 so we found a small person that<br />said that they could scuba dive.
4088835 4091395 <i>Carl wasn't an experienced diver.</i>
4091571 4095633 <i>So we gave him an introduction to<br />diving just down on the waterfront</i>
4095742 4098427 <i>and took him out to Dangerous Reef.</i>
4098678 4103332 <i>And when he saw his first great<br />white shark, he was terrified.</i>
4103416 4107478 But to give him his credit, Carl<br />actually did get into the cage
4107587 4110534 with these great, big, dangerous looking
4110607 4111950 <i>great white sharks swimming around.</i>
4112058 4115005 <i>Dangerous looking because we<br />had put a lot of bait in the water</i>
4115078 4117024 <i>to attract them to our cages.</i>
4118498 4121183 Joe Alves came into my office one day
4121250 4124811 with his hand behind his back and<br />he said, "Bill, we've screwed up."
4124887 4128869 And he held up the tanks<br />that had been miniaturized.
4128975 4132878 He said, "That little guy<br />only has eight minutes of air."
4133146 4134557 What we were not thinking
4134631 4139296 is that a small person still sucks<br />up as much air as a large person,
4139369 4141417 and the tanks were very small.
4141521 4143740 So, immediately, when he sort of panicked,
4143806 4146685 <i>he sucked up all the air out of the tank.</i>
4146793 4150252 <i>Carl was very<br />reluctant. He was afraid. Very afraid.</i>
4150363 4154573 The production manager was<br />calling out to him to get in the cage,
4154651 4158804 and he was very slow about it,<br />and just as he was about to climb in,
4158905 4161647 a <i>large shark tried to swim over it</i>
4161741 4164438 <i>and got its head stuck in the bridle,</i>
4164544 4168128 <i>and of course, it was<br />trapped and it went crazy.</i>
4168197 4171599 <i>And the tail went into the<br />back part of the little boat</i>
4171668 4174399 <i>and tore out all the hydraulic cables</i>
4174487 4177184 that took fuel and fluid to the motors.
4177290 4180191 And it started to run across<br />the deck, and as it did that,
4180293 4183627 <i>the tail flicked Carl's</i> face.
4183730 4186461 <i>And Carl just stood there,<br />and he looked up and he said,</i>
4186566 4191367 "Is that my blood?" And it<br />was actually the hydraulic fluid.
4191471 4193667 And we never got him in the water again.
4194774 4198938 <i>If Carl had been in that<br />cage, he would have lost his life.</i>
4199045 4202629 There wasn't much I<br />could've done to get over there.
4202699 4204997 The shark was still tangled,<br />and thrashing around
4205068 4207912 <i>and tangled in the cage on the bottom.</i>
4208004 4210314 <i>Carl would have been in there and drowned.</i>
4210423 4212790 <i>So his reluctance saved his life.</i>
4219499 4222127 1,100 men went into the water.
4222235 4224397 Vessel went down in 12 minutes.
4226606 4230292 Didn't see the first shark<br />for about half an hour. Tigerâ€¦
4230359 4232600 <i>A very little credited writer who made</i>
4232712 4234191 <i>the biggest breakthrough on</i> Jaws,
4234263 4236777 <i>which was a writer named Howard Sackler,</i>
4236883 4239978 <i>whose idea it was to give<br />Quint the Indianapolis speech,</i>
4240086 4242828 even though it was John<br />Milius who wrote the speech,
4242905 4245624 I mean, Howard Sackler wrote<br />like two paragraphs this big,
4245725 4250470 <i>John Milius wrote a nine page<br />monologue for Quint to say.</i>
4250563 4253112 <i>And then when Robert Shaw,<br />who himself was a writer,</i>
4253199 4257067 <i>of The Man in the</i> Glass <i>Booth<br />read Milius' 10 pages,</i>
4257170 4259901 he says, "I can't go on for 10, 15 minutes
4260006 4262748 "just talking.<br />Let me have a crack at it."
4262842 4267757 Shaw took the speech and<br />himself edited it down to five pages.
4267847 4270646 And that was the whole evolution<br />of how that speech was told,
4270750 4273549 but it did come from the mind<br />of Howard Sackler,
4273653 4275917 who remembered the actual<br />Indianapolis incident
4276022 4277535 and suggested that Quintâ€¦
4277607 4280292 That that become a Rosetta<br />stone for Quint's entire character.
4280393 4282612 Steven said, "Oh, my God."
4282678 4287366 That's the whole impetus,<br />that's the whole spine of Quint.
4287467 4293918 He's not really just crazy, but he<br />has a case out for these sharks.
4293990 4296038 You know, by the end of that first dawnâ€¦
4298211 4299519 we lost 100 men.
4301364 4303640 I don't know how many<br />sharks. Maybe 1,000.
4303733 4306384 I don't know how many men,<br />they averaged six an hour.
4306486 4311390 <i>The USS Indianapolis was top<br />secret when Peter wrote the book.</i>
4311491 4315906 So it wasn't in it. He<br />would've used it, I think.
4315978 4318288 And then, before the making of the film,
4318381 4320657 it had been unclassified<br />and Steven used it.
4320750 4324232 <i>The world learned of the<br />USS Indianapolis through Jaws</i>
4324337 4329025 <i>and it was a perfectly accurate<br />depiction insofar as I know.</i>
4329091 4332607 <i>Peter's domestic housekeeper<br />called in the day after the movie opened</i>
4332712 4336444 and she said that she wasn't<br />coming in to work the next day.
4336549 4337983 And when he said, "Why," she said,
4338084 4340246 <i>"My son was on the USS Indianapolis,</i>
4340353 4342447 "and I never knew how he died until now."
4345558 4348209 He'd been bitten in half, below the waist.
4351013 4353141 <i>The U. S.<br />naval cruiser which delivered</i>
4353216 4355264 <i>the atomic bomb used on Hiroshima</i>
4355368 4356802 <i>completed her mission,</i>
4356903 4359736 <i>but was then sunk by a Japanese submarine.</i>
4361307 4365687 <i>Out of her complement<br />of 1,196 sailors and Marines,</i>
4365761 4368742 <i>an estimated 300 died upon impact.</i>
4369282 4372183 <i>And the rest spent five days<br />in shark infested waters</i>
4372285 4374117 <i>before they were finally rescued.</i>
4375655 4378920 <i>Only 317 survived.</i>
4381444 4385290 Anyway, we delivered the bomb.
4387817 4394132 <i>Robert was a pretty Promethean<br />character. Truly bigger than life.</i>
4394240 4398199 <i>A man who intimidated me, who scared me,</i>
4398311 4402361 who exhilarated me, and I<br />liked him and I hated him andâ€¦
4403950 4409389 He had my number. He could<br />get me and he always did.
4409472 4412635 He really thought Dreyfuss<br />needed a slapping down.
4413743 4416758 Young punk with no stage experience.
4416846 4419588 He made me doubt that I<br />could do things I knew I could do,
4419699 4425388 like one day he said, "You<br />couldn't dive off the top of the Orca."
4426973 4429453 "Yes, I can."<br />"No, you couldn't."
4429642 4432543 "Can do." And I couldn't.
4432645 4434864 Shaw would say, "Look at you, Dreyfuss.
4434931 4439141 "You eat, you drink,<br />you're fat and you're sloppy.
4439235 4442421 "At your age, it's criminal.
4442505 4445452 "You couldn't even do 10 good push-ups."
4446392 4448383 He'd say, "I can do 20."
4448878 4452758 And Shaw would say, "You<br />can do 20 good push-ups?"
4453466 4455730 <i>He'd say, "Okay, Roy, you're the referee.</i>
4455835 4460636 "Tomorrow morning, we're<br />gonna see if Dreyfuss can do 20â€¦"
4460740 4462003 As soon as Shaw left, I said,
4462108 4467057 "Dreyfuss, you know how many<br />people can do 20 good push-ups?
4467263 4468697 "You are not one of them."
4469332 4471426 Couldn't do it. He psyched me
4472118 4475804 and because he psyched me,<br />I was always like on guard.
4476022 4480823 But I also really worshipped<br />him as Robert Shaw.
4480910 4485564 <i>He was a grand artist as an<br />actor, he was a wonderful writer.</i>
4485665 4489192 <i>I think, in those years, I was very<br />much appreciative of those things.</i>
4489285 4494553 And had circumstances been different,
4494623 4497399 we might have worked together again.

4578758 4581272 <i>that understand it even better than I do.</i>
4581544 4583387 <i>That have spent more time with it.</i>
4583496 4587376 <i>Having sites out there like Jawsmovie.com,</i>
4587450 4590181 <i>it confirms your identity to a generation</i>
4590286 4592755 that doesn't believe anything<br />is real if it's not on the net.
4592822 4596338 <i>I love and<br />appreciate the fact that the fans get it,</i>
4596442 4600857 <i>and not only get it as<br />a cultural phenomenon,</i>
4600930 4604298 but they get the ingredients, and<br />how the ingredients were mixed
4604400 4607199 and how they were combined<br />to fashion this entertainment.
4607303 4610512 And I really love the fans<br />for being so insightful.

4624954 4628333 <i>It was amazing to me<br />to discover what JAWSFEST became.</i>
4628424 4631337 When I first heard about it,<br />I thought it was gonna be
4631427 4634545 some rinky-dink gimmick by the Chamber<br />of Commerce of Martha's Vineyard,
4634647 4636809 and they did it so well,
4637016 4640964 <i>it brought, I guess, 2,000, 3,000<br />people from all over the world.</i>
4641036 4643164 <i>I was enormously impressed.</i>
4643239 4644980 <i>This is the first time</i>
4645074 4646872 <i>we've all been standing together,</i>
4646959 4649826 <i>and that includes the making<br />of the movie 30 years ago.</i>
4649929 4651545 <i>There was no wrap party.</i>
4651614 4655915 <i>We never were all in the same<br />place at the same time, until now.</i>
4655985 4659000 <i>So this is a more historic<br />moment than you can imagine,</i>
4659088 4660396 <i>and we thank you for it.</i>
4660506 4661769 <i>So much interest in this movie,</i>
4661874 4664741 <i>I had no idea that it had this<br />national and international attention,</i>
4664844 4666460 and this is the Star Trek convention
4666529 4668463 for people who love the movie Jaws.
4670850 4674787 Is that $3,000 bounty on<br />the shark in cash or check?
4674887 4676651 <i>You yell, "Shark!"</i>
4676739 4679754 <i>We've got a panic on our<br />hands on the Fourth of July.</i>
4679859 4681793 <i>Chief, Polly sent me to find you.</i>
4681894 4683942 <i>There's a bunch of Boy<br />Scouts out in Avril Bay</i>
4684013 4686573 <i>doing the mile swim<br />for their merit badges.</i>
4686649 4688481 <i>People come from all over the world,</i>
4688551 4693318 who are from Dublin and Edinburgh<br />and New Zealand and Australia,
4693389 4694800 and it's just stunning.
4694907 4697239 I think that to me really shows the bones
4697343 4698777 and the fan base of the movie.
4698878 4701870 <i>I mean, 30 years on, it's an<br />achievement to have us all together.</i>
4703883 4705658 Yeah, I saw that.<br />I've got one at home.
4705768 4706985 Much larger version of it.
4707086 4708349 Much larger of course.
4709371 4712033 Came to see the big shark.<br />Take some pictures.
4712291 4714259 You can literally sit in there.
4714360 4716306 He will literally swallow you whole.
4724003 4727155 <i>Do you know the Muffin Man?<br />Well, say hello.</i>
4727223 4731205 Being called the Muffin Man, I<br />haven't been called that for years.
4731744 4734714 <i>Ladies and gentlemen, the cast of Jaws.</i>
4734797 4739007 <i>This is the first time I<br />saw Jaws on a wide screen in 26 years.</i>
4739134 4741262 <i>The audience, of course, was so into it.</i>
4741337 4744113 What a great way to<br />set up watching the film.
4744223 4746487 <i>You've got the ferry going by<br />behind the screen,</i>
4746592 4748538 <i>salt air is filling your lungs.</i>
4748811 4751655 To see about 3,000 people sitting<br />there watching the giant screen,
4751764 4755291 <i>it</i> was the Jaws version of<br />The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
4756986 4758329 <i>Smile, you son of a bitch!</i>
4771784 4773582 <i>Jaws is really unique in the way</i>
4773686 4775484 <i>that it was filmed in this specific place.</i>
4775571 4778051 <i>Other movies are filmed in<br />all kinds of obscure locations.</i>
4778157 4780034 Most people don't have a clue<br />where they were filmed.
4780109 4782692 <i>Jaws was right here all over this island.</i>
4782795 4785639 <i>And you can't really get away<br />from it, even if you wanted to.</i>
4786815 4787839 <i>Coming up on the left,</i>
4787967 4791449 <i>you'll see the house that was used<br />for the Brody residence in the film.</i>
4792071 4793812 <i>If you wanted to go see a film location,</i>
4794073 4796235 things change, houses get painted,
4796342 4799027 and most of the time,<br />they're even on a sound stage.
4799111 4801660 <i>With Jaws, you can take a ferry ride,</i>
4801764 4804290 <i>and you'll step off the ferry<br />and you are in Amity.</i>
4804400 4807233 <i>It has really not changed in 30 years.</i>
4817513 4820255 <i>I do know that<br />people come here on a regular basis.</i>
4820366 4823518 <i>Jaws questions are probably<br />some of the top questions we get</i>
4823686 4825211 <i>in our visitor information centers.</i>
4825854 4827936 They ask us quite often
4828040 4829040 if they can still see<br />some of the locations
4829108 4831622 where scenes from the movie were filmed.
4831694 4832843 <i>The answer is yes.</i>
4833329 4835161 <i>Some of the scenes include South Beach,</i>
4835230 4837005 <i>where the opening bonfire was done.</i>
4837533 4840264 <i>Amity Town Hall, which is<br />actually Edgar town Town Hall,</i>
4840336 4842145 <i>right on Main Street in Edgar town.</i>
4842638 4844697 <i>Also the Chappaquiddick ferry.</i>
4845324 4848066 <i>It is a very small<br />ferry that takes you between</i>
4848160 4851073 <i>Edgar town and its island,<br />which is Chappaquiddick.</i>
4853549 4855813 <i>At the Grange Hall in West Tisbury,</i>
4855884 4858285 <i>the JAWSFEST Behind The Screams exhibit</i>
4858354 4860721 <i>is drawing hundreds of islanders and fans.</i>
4862408 4864035 <i>Contributed by private collectors,</i>
4864143 4866828 <i>these artifacts of Jaws<br />have returned to the island</i>
4866929 4869193 <i>for the first time in decades.</i>
4869264 4871847 Prop collecting has become a<br />really big business in recent years,
4871934 4872934 thanks to the Internet.
4873001 4875095 It's easy for people to find props
4875187 4877201 <i>from recent films all over the place.</i>
4877272 4880469 <i>It's very difficult to find<br />props from classic films,</i>
4880542 4882158 <i>especially a film like Jaws.</i>
4883212 4886204 <i>I got into Jaws<br />when I was about five years old.</i>
4886281 4888830 <i>One of the first props I<br />ever had was a harpoon gun.</i>
4889284 4892049 And if you're five years old<br />and you have the harpoon gun,
4892121 4895853 of course, you need the barrels and<br />the tank and the list goes on and on.
4896325 4898703 <i>I spent 30 years of my life<br />tracking this stuff down.</i>
4898811 4902122 <i>And I think I did a pretty good<br />job, considering I found out</i>
4902231 4905075 <i>that I probably have one of the<br />largest collections in the world.</i>
4912858 4915134 <i>And whatever<br />happened to the ultimate Jaws prop?</i>
4915661 4917777 <i>Quint's trusty fishing boat, the</i> Orca,
4918230 4922315 <i>which served as a floating set for<br />nearly four months of shooting at sea.</i>
4923419 4925717 <i>Well, I had</i> a <i>good<br />souvenir. I had the</i> Orca <i>for a while.</i>
4925788 4928200 <i>I had the Orca shipped back<br />to Universal Studios.</i>
4928307 4930036 <i>We put it on the tour, in the back lot.</i>
4930142 4932270 <i>And every once in a while,<br />|'cl go up in my little electric cart,</i>
4932361 4933954 <i>and I'd visit the Orca, by myself.</i>
4934062 4935461 I'd look around and make sure<br />no tourists are around,
4935531 4936646 and nobody can see me.
4936732 4939895 And I would just sit<br />inside the pilot house,
4939968 4942050 or I would sit in one<br />of the cabins, right.
4942154 4945283 <i>Walk down those few steps to<br />where all the life jackets were</i>
4945374 4947957 <i>just hanging, dripping,<br />when the boat began to sink.</i>
4948060 4950609 <i>And I would just kind of reminisce<br />and kind of give thanks that</i>
4950712 4952612 <i>that movie sort of launched my career,</i>
4952714 4955661 <i>but I would go there alone,<br />and spend time on it</i>
4955751 4956751 <i>and didn't tell anybody.</i>
4956819 4959038 Then one day, about six months later,
4959138 4961914 I went for another journey<br />back in time, down memory lane.
4961990 4963651 The boat was gone.
4963759 4966285 And I called up the head of the back lot,
4966361 4967658 and I said, "What happened to the Orca?"
4967729 4969458 He said, "Well, it was just rotting there.
4969565 4972865 "So, we took an ax and took<br />a couple of chainsaws,
4972935 4976462 "and we cut it up for timber.<br />We shipped it out."
4977089 4980605 And I went nuts.<br />I went nuts.
4980676 4982303 I feel very bad about<br />all the things I said
4982377 4983936 to that poor man who took my phone call.
4984012 4987380 But I was just beside myself.<br />They had destroyed this.
4987483 4991386 This piece of wood, originally<br />called the Warlock, by the way.
4991487 4993046 <i>It was a real boat called the Warlock,</i>
4993121 4995419 <i>and we painted that over it, a weird omen,</i>
4995491 4997368 <i>and called it the</i> Orca.
4997910 5000754 And the fact that the boat<br />was no longer in existence,
5000863 5002228 it had died, you know?
5002865 5005527 And it was just<br />the strangest feeling for me,
5005601 5007228 but in a way it was good for me,
5007319 5008912 because it cut the umbilical cord
5009021 5011706 that was joining me<br />to some of my worst memories
5011773 5014014 about filming that movie.
5014193 5016992 And it kind of freed me when they<br />broke the boat into many pieces.
5017079 5019912 But I did recover both twin screws,
5019982 5022781 I got the propeller blades back,
5023252 5026051 and I got the pilot wheel.
5028874 5030456 The Orca <i>is a cast</i> member.
5030526 5033461 And what a lot of<br />people don't realize is that
5033529 5039343 Joe Alves built an exact<br />replica on pontoons,
5040152 5043144 <i>which was affectionately<br />called the Orca II.</i>
5044356 5047223 <i>The</i> Orca <i>II,</i> a <i>fiberglass stunt double,</i>
5047326 5050011 <i>that was designed to sink<br />and re-emerge on command,</i>
5050078 5051705 <i>has remained on the Vineyard.</i>
5052915 5054997 <i>Islander and Jaws boat wrangler,</i>
5055083 5057802 <i>Lynn Murphy, has kept her<br />on a shoreline in Menemsha</i>
5057903 5059598 <i>since filming completed.</i>
5059805 5061864 <i>When they clean up after a movie,</i>
5061974 5064022 <i>they gotta pick up<br />their junk and clear it out.</i>
5064092 5066288 <i>They said, "Well, we<br />gotta get rid of this stuff."</i>
5066378 5068187 <i>So, I bought the</i> Orca.
5068297 5070095 I looked it over and there was lumber
5070198 5072826 and things in the special effects barge,
5072935 5074380 and I wasn't sure just exactly how
5074469 5075868 <i>I was gonna use it at the time,</i>
5075938 5077656 <i>but I wasn't gonna let it go to the dump.</i>
5080259 5083604 <i>Yeah, you can see the<br />mechanism that was under the</i> Orca.
5083679 5085841 <i>You see all that?<br />That was never</i> a boat.
5086298 5087413 <i>There was never a bottom.</i>
5088483 5090884 <i>The</i> Orca <i>||'s resting site has served</i>
5090953 5093365 <i>as sort of a holy grail destination</i>
5093472 5095463 <i>for fans who've made pilgrimages</i>

5106585 5109532 <i>People started<br />to realize what all this stuff was,</i>
5109605 5113769 and over the years,<br />there'd be a porthole missing.
5114693 5119711 <i>We had several of the balsa<br />wood stems and they'd disappear,</i>
5119781 5123331 <i>and then the flying bridge<br />came off, and so on and so forth.</i>
5123435 5126985 <i>As if the sand wasn't bad<br />enough, guys, I got pricker bushes now.</i>
5127139 5128664 <i>I'm a real fan, huh?</i>
5129358 5130655 <i>Trespassing is forbidden,</i>
5130726 5133969 <i>and the marshy terrain<br />surrounding it is quite hazardous.</i>
5135347 5138874 <i>But none of that has deterred the<br />more tenacious and adventurous fans</i>
5138984 5140884 <i>from seeking to get an up close look.</i>
5140986 5144513 I've watched this boat sink<br />more times than I could tell you.
5144623 5147456 It's kind of nice to see it,<br />but we gotta get out of here.
5148210 5149257 This is private property.
5149378 5150675 Explain what we're doing here.
5150746 5153625 I am one of three complete idiots.
5154366 5158428 Out here freezing in the middle<br />of the night looking for the Orca II.
5158637 5160856 This is it.<br />Look at this thing.
5163592 5166584 <i>Today virtually<br />nothing remains of the Orca II.</i>
5166662 5168494 This is the end of the Orca.
5168563 5170827 And this is the only thing<br />that we have left of her.
5170932 5174197 We decided we'd take her home<br />before she was all gone.
5174403 5178567 <i>They were selling her for<br />$100 a six-inch square on eBay.</i>
5181610 5184489 <i>Finally, whatever<br />became of Bruce, himself?</i>
5185681 5187775 <i>AH of the mechanical sharks used for Jaws</i>
5187849 5191251 <i>were returned to the back lot of<br />Universal Studios in Hollywood,</i>
5191319 5194835 <i>where they were stored and<br />eventually succumbed to the elements.</i>
5196425 5199110 <i>Throughout the span of the Jaws franchise,</i>
5199211 5201578 <i>there have been four distinct incarnations</i>
5201680 5202772 <i>of the mechanical shark.</i>
5203231 5205165 <i>Each one aiming to improve on looks</i>
5205233 5207315 <i>and functionality over its predecessor.</i>
5208053 5210420 <i>But for the truest fans,<br />it is the original</i>
5210539 5213008 <i>with its trademark jowls that remains</i>
5213075 5215487 <i>the only true embodiment of Jaws.</i>
5215594 5218154 <i>What happened is that we needed a hinge,</i>
5218430 5222128 so you got this jowl kind<br />of thing that happens,
5222234 5226444 which I sort of hated, but<br />I guess Jaws fans love it.
5226872 5230809 <i>I guess the shark had a character<br />that people got familiar with.</i>
5232411 5236188 <i>Though he's been replaced<br />by a dissimilar shark in recent years,</i>
5236264 5239609 <i>Universal Studios, Hollywood,<br />once showcased this casting</i>
5239718 5244269 <i>from the original Bruce mold as<br />a photo op for visitors to the park.</i>
5245307 5248322 <i>Today, he remains the<br />last copy from that mold,</i>
5248427 5252989 <i>but has since been relegated to a<br />junkyard in San Fernando Valley.</i>
5254282 5257525 <i>Universal Studios, with<br />locations in Hollywood,</i>
5257636 5260048 <i>Orlando and Osaka, Japan,</i>
5260122 5263103 <i>has kept their attractions up<br />to date throughout the years.</i>
5263575 5264804 <i>How many of you saw the film</i> Jaws?
5264910 5268369 <i>But the lasting popularity<br />of Hollywood's model blockbuster</i>
5268480 5270858 <i>has assured it an enduring place</i>
5270932 5273299 <i>in all three theme parks to this day.</i>
5278457 5281438 <i>Our shark, which<br />has been here since the mid-'70s,</i>
5281510 5285094 <i>works a heck of a lot better than<br />the shark in the movie ever worked.</i>
5285197 5288758 But the reason I think it<br />rates so highly still to this day
5288867 5292132 is because Steven was so good<br />at using the camera as the shark.
5292237 5295787 So, 40 minutes into the movie<br />when you finally see the shark,
5295874 5297456 <i>you're so terrified of it.</i>
5297526 5299187 <i>And I think that's still in people's minds</i>
5299261 5300843 <i>when they come here<br />and ride this attraction,</i>
5300946 5303040 they're terrified of the<br />shark before they ever see it.
5303148 5306140 So, we don't have to do a<br />whole lot to make people scream.
5306251 5307251 So, it's great.
5308887 5311652 <i>The back lot<br />shark itself has even made cameos</i>
5311740 5314687 <i>in other Universal productions<br />throughout the years,</i>
5314793 5317228 <i>usually being played for laughs.</i>
5317329 5319548 <i>But whether for humor or for screams,</i>
5319631 5322544 <i>one thing is certain,<br />at Universal Studios,</i>
5322634 5327117 <i>even after 30 years, the<br />shark is definitely still working.</i>
5334830 5338767 <i>For a brief moment<br />in time, life seemed to imitate art.</i>
5339050 5340734 <i>As the waters of Martha's Vineyard</i>
5340836 5343396 <i>once again hosted the<br />presence of a great white.</i>
5343939 5347785 <i>Only this time, the shark wasn't<br />constructed from rubber and steel.</i>
5348059 5351996 September 21 st, I'll<br />never forget that date, 2004.
5352063 5355294 <i>The big why is, is why that shark<br />swam not only in shallow waters,</i>
5355367 5359144 but way up into a very tight,<br />shallow estuarine system.
5359254 5362372 What motivated that shark to<br />get in there, we'll never know.
5362474 5364806 Shark! A shark!
5366011 5368105 <i>When the great white surfaced in</i> Jaws,
5368179 5372423 <i>Amity Island had to call in Richard<br />Dreyfuss, as ichthyologist Matt Hooper.</i>
5372634 5374796 Matt Hooper. I'm from<br />the Oceanographic Institute.
5375804 5378683 <i>But the Vineyard has its own<br />resident shark expert</i>
5378757 5382637 <i>in Greg Skomal of the Massachusetts<br />Division of Marine Fisheries.</i>
5383278 5387545 So many differences between 1975 and 2004.
5387716 5390925 And that's the fact that instead<br />of all the townspeople going out
5391286 5395336 <i>and trying to kill it with dynamite<br />explosives and shotguns,</i>
5395407 5399037 <i>spear guns, you name it, the<br />public kind of embraced this animal.</i>
5399110 5401579 <i>And the cry I got, that far<br />outweighed the negative,</i>
5401680 5404923 <i>was this positive, "Quit messing<br />around and save that shark."</i>
5409421 5414791 That we can learn to be concerned for<br />this animal that Jaws taught us to dread
5414859 5418159 and get past that mythology,<br />to look behind the Jaws
5418229 5420072 <i>and look at this wild animal<br />that's in need of help,</i>
5420165 5422213 <i>and draw on our humanity to rescue it,</i>
5422317 5424285 <i>I think is a step in the right direction.</i>
5425487 5427581 <i>And that step is no small one.</i>
5428440 5432775 <i>Despite infrequent, but highly<br />publicized shark attacks in recent years,</i>
5433328 5435695 <i>the general public's<br />attitude towards sharks</i>
5435780 5438613 <i>has indeed come a long way since the '70s.</i>
5439501 5441981 <i>One of the problems of<br />creating a perfect villain,</i>
5442070 5444937 <i>a machine that kills and<br />eats and makes little sharks,</i>
5445040 5448066 is that the public quickly subscribes
5448159 5452995 <i>to that easy view of the<br />shark as dreadful enemies.</i>
5453081 5458713 <i>Jaws and the sequels, unfortunately,<br />made them easy to dislike.</i>
5458887 5461436 It made people very conscious of sharks,
5461906 5467094 and we then realized that<br />we had to put the facts right,
5467178 5471160 <i>to really convince people<br />that sharks are to be respected,</i>
5471533 5474013 <i>and we must learn to<br />live with them in the ocean.</i>
5474102 5475786 <i>The great white shark, for instance,</i>
5475854 5478539 <i>has been protected for several years now,</i>
5478640 5481268 <i>and the numbers are slowly coming back.</i>
5481643 5484294 Over the last 30 years,<br />the science has evolved,
5484396 5487923 so we understand that sharks<br />have a place in the ocean,
5488299 5489596 and it's an important place.
5490402 5492962 <i>Environmental groups like<br />Environmental Defense,</i>
5493038 5495154 <i>the New England Aquarium<br />and others with whom I work,</i>
5495240 5497834 have found that the association with Jaws
5497942 5502311 draws people to at least<br />listen to what I have to say.
5502764 5505882 <i>So, it has given me the<br />opportunity to have a third career,</i>
5505950 5508248 <i>in the sense of being a spokesman</i>
5508319 5511766 <i>for the environment and for the oceans.</i>
5512957 5515585 <i>Look at that animal, will you, please?</i>
5516678 5518669 <i>He is just magnificent.</i>
5519047 5521744 <i>One of the great<br />freedoms that Jaws gave me was to</i>
5521850 5524376 <i>learn about the ocean<br />that I had written about,</i>
5524486 5526545 <i>so that for the past 30 years,</i>
5526638 5529437 <i>Wendy and the kids and I have<br />been able to go around the world,</i>
5529507 5532340 <i>diving with all of these<br />animals of different kinds,</i>
5532444 5535960 <i>learning the problems that<br />they face, the truth about them,</i>
5536064 5538544 <i>having to do with sharks, for instance.</i>
5538616 5541711 If we can harness all<br />the interest in <i>Jaws,</i>
5541803 5544716 and from the fans of Jaws,<br />to the enthusiasts of <i>Jaws,</i>
5544806 5548253 to the people who see it and who<br />learn from it and who are liking it,
5548359 5550509 into a protection movement for the oceans,
5550612 5552706 we'd have a massive force going.
5560305 5565744 <i>The gilt-edged bite of Jaws<br />on so many of today's pop culture artisans</i>
5565827 5569104 <i>speaks powerfully to the<br />stamina of this single film.</i>
5569581 5572141 <i>Its extraordinary shelf life<br />has allowed it to function</i>
5572217 5574413 <i>as sort of a creative well</i>
5574486 5578480 <i>from which filmmakers may<br />draw inspiration and innovation.</i>
5578923 5581551 <i>A well that never seems to run dry.</i>
5583845 5587475 Anyone who's around my age,<br />who's in this movie business,
5587749 5591379 always kind of cites Jaws <i>as</i> the<br />first movie they remember seeing,
5591486 5594217 or the movie that made<br />them want to get into movies,
5594305 5596501 or started their love affair with movies.
5596608 5597939 I still remember the first time
5598042 5600568 that I saw Jaws in the<br />theater and how it affected me.
5600678 5601975 <i>I walked away thinking,</i>
5602046 5605129 <i>"I wanna learn how to<br />do that when I get older."</i>
5605300 5610682 And it absolutely changed the<br />direction of my life in one night.
5610789 5613668 I'm always really grateful
5613775 5616517 when anybody, especially a young<br />director, comes over to me and tells me
5616594 5620155 that they were in some way<br />strangely influenced by <i>Jaws,</i>
5620248 5622330 and I say, "Oh, great.<br />You're part of our club, then.
5622784 5623797 <i>"You got it."</i>
5623885 5628334 <i>I aggressively pursued<br />Jaws as a way to learn from the master.</i>
5628439 5631249 I saw the light, I saw Jaws and I saw
5631643 5634385 that's the promised land up there.
5634496 5635496 That's what you have to aim for.
5635597 5636940 It affected me in film making
5637015 5639757 in just wanting to make movies<br />that were larger than life.
5639868 5642644 Certainly, I think it was one<br />of those big films of my life
5642720 5646167 that inspired me eventually to<br />wanna go on to be a filmmaker.
5646357 5648075 I think that anyone that wants to make
5648176 5651237 big Hollywood blockbuster<br />movies is certainly inspired by Jaws.
5651346 5654714 Probably every film I make, I'm always<br />evoking Jaws, one way or another.
5654816 5658025 It's like one of the basic films<br />that drives me as a filmmaker.
5658102 5661197 I've worked with Steven on three projects,
5661289 5663769 and I still stand next to him<br />and every time I look at him, I go,
5663842 5665571 "That's the guy that did <i>Jaws.</i>
5665643 5667327 "That's the reason why I'm here."
5667412 5671781 I hope the picture has<br />inspired a lot of filmmakers.
5672000 5677200 I mean, that's another added<br />benefit to this whole miraculous event.
5677755 5679416 <i>The hardest thing in the film business</i>
5679490 5684337 is not so much to do something<br />that's usually successful.
5684429 5688115 Harder than that is to create<br />something that has longevity.
5688216 5690651 There've been a lot<br />of great pictures made.
5690752 5693767 But one of the tests is the test of time.
5693872 5698673 The fact that that film and<br />the music that went with it
5698776 5700710 lingers in people's minds
5700778 5704009 is a lot of things. It's a<br />great compliment to me,
5704082 5707074 and to Steven Spielberg, and the people<br />who wrote it and acted it and all of that.
5707151 5709984 It's quite an amazing thing for an actor,
5710054 5714423 who was really an insignificant<br />player in the scheme of things,
5714626 5721145 to have a lifelong tale,<br />of a fishtail behind me.
5721249 5724264 Those first instincts that David and I had
5724352 5729006 <i>when we read the manuscript<br />by Peter Benchley proved correct.</i>
5729073 5733169 <i>And it feels good to know<br />that it has lasted all this time.</i>
5733444 5736527 Almost every week or month,
5736631 5740215 somebody who knows that I<br />was connected with the production
5740285 5742162 will tell me where they were.
5742270 5746537 <i>It's like the beginning of World<br />War II, the death of Kennedy.</i>
5747909 5750276 <i>The emotional experience provided by Jaws</i>
5751346 5754225 will go on and on and on and on forever.
5754299 5756347 I mean, who doesn't like Bambi?
5756918 5759910 <i>Bambi goes on forever.<br />Snow White goes on forever.</i>
5760021 5761830 Jaws goes on forever.
5780742 5784269 <i>I certainly think that all of us<br />went through a survival adventure together,</i>
5784412 5786471 <i>the entire crew and cast and myself.</i>
5786581 5790791 <i>And I have very good memories in<br />many respects to the making of Jaws,</i>
5790952 5792761 <i>but I have many more bad memories.</i>
5793221 5796703 <i>Memories that still haunt my<br />nightmares, still wake me up sweating,</i>
5796774 5799323 but the bottom line is I'm grateful.
5799594 5802825 Because I went through<br />a kind of baptism of water.
5802914 5808398 And I came out of it, not only<br />alive, which was my main goal,
5808503 5811347 and getting through <i>Jaws</i> was<br />to come out of it in one piece,
5811439 5813248 but I came out of it with a career.
5813524 5815549 And I will forever be grateful,
5815626 5818994 no matter what I tell you<br />about those nightmares,
5819163 5821825 <i>to the fact that the dream<br />from the nightmare was</i>
5821933 5824777 <i>that I got a chance to make<br />any movie I wanted to make.</i>
5824986 5827899 <i>And that has continued to this day.</i>
5830808 5836326 Time will only tell when Jaws will<br />fade from the collective memory.
5836848 5839362 But I think as long <i>as</i><br />there are sharks in the sea,
5839467 5842994 and as long as there are<br />oceans and bodies of water,
5843187 5846532 as long as there are kids with imagination
5846641 5849110 who like to torture and scare each other,
5849193 5852493 Jaws is going to be probably<br />around for a long time.
6055132 6058375 The shark is working.<br />Repeat. The shark is still working.
6058486 6061012 <i>Repeat.<br />The shark is still working.</i>
