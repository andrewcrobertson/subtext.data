918 3125 Universal definitely has<br />an intense commitment
3212 7501 to preservation and<br />restoration of its film library.
7591 11300 <i>The restoration of Jaws is<br />a tremendous responsibility.</i>
14139 15595 <i>Centennial Project is</i>
15682 18094 <i>Universal Pictures' 100th anniversary.</i>
18310 20722 <i>We are releasing 100 of our titles.</i>
20812 25352 Thirteen of our classic titles are<br />being fully restored on a film level.
25442 28776 <i>In the case of Jaws,<br />this is history, culture.</i>
28862 30352 Whoa. Hold on.
30447 32404 <i>What's exciting about this digital age</i>
32491 34448 <i>where we're able to restore these movies,</i>
34535 36151 <i>we can bring these classic movies</i>
36245 38282 back to life in a way that makes them
38372 40534 more vivid than even we remember them
40624 42706 when we went to the cinema to see them.
47631 50339 The restoration of Jaws<br />began with, literally,
50425 53884 going through our records,<br />our vault inventory,
53971 56963 and understanding what<br />elements were at our disposal.
60018 62555 <i>Universal has<br />always had a strong commitment</i>
62729 65642 <i>to preservation, restoration<br />in their film heritage.</i>
67484 69816 <i>In the library,<br />in the vaults we have here,</i>
69903 73237 we've got over<br />a million pieces of material.
73323 76657 <i>Around the world, we've got over<br />three million pieces of material.</i>
77327 81036 <i>In Jaws, there's about<br />2,700 pieces of this altogether.</i>
83333 85290 <i>When we started on the Jaws project</i>
85377 89245 <i>we determined that luckily, we<br />were able to use the original negative</i>
89339 91250 <i>and that was our primary source.</i>
97306 100890 Working with a negative is always<br />gonna get you a better resolution.
101351 103592 <i>But passes on the element add up.</i>
104563 107351 The negative of Jaws was<br />pretty crummy, was pretty bad.
109526 111016 <i>The first thing we want<br />to do when we have that element,</i>
111111 112111 <i>we wanna make sure</i>
112195 115028 <i>that all the perforations are<br />correct, we don't have any tears.</i>
116116 118278 <i>Many sections had vertical scratches</i>
118368 120826 <i>running through significant<br />portions of the film.</i>
123373 124863 Come on in the water!
125500 128492 We felt the best result<br />was to do a wet gate scan.
132966 136300 <i>There is a special liquid<br />that will take all the scratches</i>
136386 138252 <i>and basically erase them.</i>
141558 143140 <i>As the film is on the scanner,</i>
143226 145934 <i>it's literally passed<br />through this liquid bath</i>
146063 148395 <i>so that those scratches are not visible</i>
148482 150814 <i>to the light that's<br />passing through that film.</i>
153195 155277 With <i>Jaws</i> the colorists need to have</i>
155364 157401 <i>as much information to<br />work with as possible.</i>
157574 160908 <i>We're checking to make sure that<br />the full range of the image is there.</i>
161578 164070 That's really what the<br />scanning process is about.
167042 168908 <i>Once we had the digital scans,</i>
169002 173667 <i>we went ahead and dealt with<br />issues such as film movement and dirt.</i>
173757 176374 <i>We have very high-end<br />graphics and editing systems.</i>
176593 178254 <i>These tools enable us<br />to take the digital data</i>
178345 179961 <i>that results from the film scans</i>
180097 183010 <i>and manipulate those pixels<br />in many different ways.</i>
185268 188260 <i>With Jaws, each damage was different.</i>
191775 193516 Just would have to<br />look at it and see if you
193610 196853 could take a frame after the<br />damage or a frame before.
198782 200648 <i>Part of a good frame here,<br />a good frame there.</i>
201034 205119 <i>Composite it together<br />and digitally clean it out.</i>
205288 208280 <i>You could spend three to<br />four hours on one frame.</i>
209960 210960 Chief Brody!
211336 212997 When you're working with<br />an original negative,
213213 216080 <i>across some of the cuts, you<br />see tremendous differences</i>
216174 218586 <i>in color, brightness, contrast.</i>
220095 222757 <i>Our colorists do a great job<br />at matching all those shots.</i>
227310 229768 We had a particular<br />issue inside the cabin.
231148 233310 <i>Those windows didn't match cut-to-cut.</i>
233650 238065 I had to balance out the view<br />from the inside which changed.
238155 239737 <i>The viewer should not be distracted</i>
239823 241439 <i>because the levels of light are changing.</i>
242159 244241 <i>Nothing materially<br />was changed about the film.</i>
244411 248370 But the image on a really, really<br />good hi-def TV screen looks better
248498 251581 than the film looked when<br />first projected in 1975.
251668 253659 See that?<br />I got the crème <i>de la</i> crème.
254087 256294 Right there.<br />Mary Ellen Moffit.
257591 260003 She broke my heart.
261928 263885 The <i>audio side on</i> Jaws,
263972 267931 <i>our project was<br />to build a 7.1 up mix.</i>
268018 269099 <i>It's an iconic film.</i>
269186 272053 We're very sensitive to the<br />integrity of the original mix.
272147 274263 At that time, it was an analogue process.
274357 277440 They recorded on 35 mm mag.
277778 279360 <i>We're taking all that sound information</i>
279446 280936 <i>and adding additional channels to it.</i>
281031 284365 <i>That process consists<br />of taking the original dialogue,</i>
284451 286818 music and effects mono-tracks
286912 291281 and realizing that we're now<br />gonna place it in a 7.1 audio codec.
291374 295959 <i>To do that, you're gonna have to go<br />and get backgrounds and sound effects</i>
296046 298663 that can get you to move<br />left to right on the screen.
298840 300626 <i>Once you've got all those elements</i>
300717 302458 <i>picked out, then you've got the music.</i>
302552 305544 <i>There's certainly a number<br />of things about Jaws that are unique.</i>
306515 308222 A lot of that on<br />the audio side goes back to
308308 311050 those first two notes<br />in John Williams' score.
312854 314720 <i>They set the tone for the shark.</i>
323031 325022 Oh, God, help!
325242 327859 <i>Throughout the film, you<br />don't necessarily see the shark,</i>
328036 332030 <i>but you hear those notes, and<br />so the sound really drives that film.</i>
334960 336826 <i>In some places you don't hear anything.</i>
336920 339252 <i>You're underwater and<br />there's nothing but score.</i>
340799 343757 <i>That is what lets you know that<br />something is about to happen.</i>
348265 352054 Hey. He's taking it.
353270 355602 Go!
360026 363815 Boys, I think he's come back<br />for his noon feeding.
365115 367857 The sound is better than<br />we've ever heard it before.
368118 371031 <i>Our whole intent is to be able to fulfill</i>
371121 374034 <i>the audio experience<br />in that 7.1 remix.</i>
378837 380373 <i>They put kind of a dinosaur sound</i>
380463 381999 when the shark is sinking<br />at the end of the film
382090 383580 and you can hear it better.
386678 388544 It doesn't overpower anything, it's just
388638 390174 gonna be a little more<br />audible to the ear now.
391516 394474 <i>The outputs of this<br />process are both film and digital.</i>
394811 396802 <i>We're restoring high<br />resolution digital files,</i>
396897 398854 <i>as well as recording a new negative.</i>
398982 401770 We do both because digital files,
401860 403942 while they are convenient to work with
404029 406111 <i>and they allow us a wide range of options,</i>
406281 409194 <i>for an archival means, we still<br />want a piece of film to put away.</i>
409326 410816 This is our cultural heritage.
410994 413326 <i>It's very important to<br />preserve the physical film,</i>
413455 415446 the 35 mm film and the negative.
415832 417618 <i>Film is a known commodity.</i>
417709 420747 <i>We can put that on a shelf and<br />store it in the proper conditions</i>
420962 423169 <i>and that thing will last 100 years plus.</i>
425884 427420 <i>It's the movie the people remember.</i>
427510 430798 It's just really crystal<br />clear and very vivid.
431723 434715 <i>I, quite honestly, have<br />never seen this level of commitment.</i>
434935 438098 We're very passionate about <i>Jaws</i><br />and using the tools that we have
438188 441180 <i>it allows us to get the best<br />possible restoration.</i>
443318 444979 There's something else out there.
445070 446070 What is it?
446363 447363 It was a shark.
449240 451072 Originally in the theater,<br />you might have seen
451159 453116 <i>film movement as the print wore out.</i>
453370 456112 <i>Or you might have seen dirt<br />as the print got dirtier.</i>
457082 459540 <i>But today, with a digital file cleaned up</i>
459626 462789 <i>it looks like that<br />on play one and play 1,000.</i>
462879 464995 <i>The new Jaws is</i> still <i>the Jaws Jaws.</i>
465674 468257 <i>It's enhanced by<br />the HD Blu-ray experience.</i>
469094 470926 People are gonna like what they see.
471721 473052 <i>It looks amazing.</i>
474224 476591 <i>This shark, swallow you whole.</i>
476851 479138 <i>But I'll catch him and kill him.</i>
479396 483390 For that, you get the head,<br />the tail, the whole damn thing.
485360 486646 You're going to need a bigger boat.
487404 489771 The wonderful thing about this restoration
489864 493607 <i>is what you get is something<br />that for both sight and sound,</i>
493868 497327 is something that I didn't even<br />get when I made the movie.
