1736944 1738528 Um, I'm more interested
1738613 1742365 in what questions you all have<br />about cold fusion.
1742491 1746119 So I thought we would start<br />with those. Any questions?
1749373 1752167 - Please?<br />- Yeah, I have, Dr. Russell.
1752752 1757380 Can you explain the actual process<br />of fusion? You know, the theory?
1758215 1760300 Yes. There it is.
1761302 1763720 This is the apparatus.
1764472 1768892 And very simply,<br />when positively charged deuterons
1769060 1771478 are attracted<br />to the palladium cathode,
1771979 1773521 they cram together.
1773606 1778109 There are millions and millions<br />of them getting closer and closer,
1778277 1783114 and then they fuse. And they create<br />energy in the form of helium.
1783199 1787285 But I read that the experiment<br />couldn't be replicated. So...
1787954 1791373 - How do we know it works?<br />- Well, we don't.
1792291 1793708 Not yet.
1794669 1799547 But if you remember, Einstein, he knew<br />the theory of relativity to be true
1799632 1803218 long before he could prove it.<br />He felt the truth.
1803928 1808306 And some of us feel the same way<br />about cold fusion.
1808474 1810725 Because it's there, it's in nature,
1810893 1815271 the raw, natural power<br />just waiting to be harnessed.
1815439 1820110 And when we ignite<br />that cold fusion fire,
1820194 1822696 I mean, just imagine...
1823531 1827158 There's more energy<br />in one cubic mile of sea water
1827326 1830328 than in all the known<br />oil reserves on Earth.
1830955 1837085 You could drive your car 55 million<br />miles on a gallon of heavy water.
1837461 1842799 It would be the end of pollution.<br />Warmth for the whole world.
1844301 1847554 So why don't I, uh, demonstrate for you
1848097 1851891 why other people in the past<br />have been so unsuccessful?
1853561 1854978 They use very complex...

5156944 5161323 DR. BOTVIN: I have run every test<br />on this cold fusion formula,
5161407 5168079 and must conclude that it is not<br />merely incomplete, but impossible.
5168289 5172375 You may as well try to create<br />perpetual motion, Mr. Tretiak.
5173002 5175337 I invest millions,
5177048 5179883 and you can't make it work!
5183596 5186306 What are you doing with my money?
5188809 5194272 Do you think it comes so easy? No!
5194440 5200153 Sir, I have been working<br />for nearly two weeks without sleep.
5201113 5205450 At first blush, the theorem appears<br />quite impressive. Convincing.
5205534 5207035 It does?
5211749 5215794 Yes, it does.
5216629 5220548 Good man. We can use it<br />to destroy our enemies.
5223052 5225804 <i>Only Dr. Russell can spoil my plan.</i>
5225971 5228807 If she gets back to London<br />and speaks to the press.
5228891 5234104 From here to the airport are three<br />army checkpoints, all loyal to us.
5234563 5239651 Make sure they all get the message.<br />She doesn't leave Moscow alive.
5242154 5246533 Mr. President, as former<br />Vice Minister of Energy and Power,
5247034 5251704 I hear all manner of schemes<br />that provide cheaper energy.
5251872 5254916 And as our countrymen<br />freeze to death,
5255626 5259003 I've become aware of<br />a marvelous new technology,
5259171 5264634 about which I'm hopelessly out of<br />my league from a scientific viewpoint.
5264927 5267846 That's why I brought<br />our eminent physicist here,
5268013 5271349 Dr. Lev Botvin<br />from the University of Moscow.
5271517 5276729 Before we are dazzled by the good news,<br />let's dispense with the bad.
5276897 5278982 What is the price of this marvel?
5279150 5282485 The cost of research<br />and development are there,
5282570 5284946 which is all you are asked to defray.
5291245 5294038 Ten billion in hard currency?
5294123 5298293 I can't even pay my teachers,<br />my miners, my doctors.
5306010 5307886 Where are you heading?
5308387 5311598 I thought we'd drink some vodka<br />to get warmer.
5316187 5322192 Like the miracle of socialism,<br />our miracle of cold fusion failed.
5322359 5327780 But no matter. We have sold<br />cold fusion to President Karpov.
5327948 5331409 We will use the scandal<br />of his failure to destroy him.
5331577 5334245 The army must be mobilized<br />by midnight tomorrow.
5334330 5337999 You're in a hurry, Ivan Petrovich.<br />That's one day.
5338209 5340460 ILYA: Not now, old witch, we're working.
5341086 5343254 TRETIAK: Yes, think of it.
5343339 5348051 In one day you can be proud again<br />to be a Russian general.
5348928 5352764 With a big nuclear missile<br />where your prick used to be.
