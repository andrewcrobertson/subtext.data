49382 52968 Simon Magus was a magician<br />and a sorcerer in...
56556 58933 In Sumeria.
59725 62602 And what happened<br />to Simon Magus, Bartolo?
63020 67520 Jesus' disciples performed miracles.<br />When Simon Magus saw the miracles
68401 71278 he offered Peter gold<br />for God's powers.
72154 74197 And how did Peter respond?
75324 77075 John Rossi?
79120 80371 Stand up.
86419 88712 Answer my question, John Rossi.
90089 92174 That's not my name.
92883 96803 You and all the other bastards<br />lucky enough to be here,
96971 101471 children of sin, spawn of the damned,<br />are all named for saints!
104312 106897 Saints who were disciplined.
106981 108899 Saints who were chaste.
110276 112987 You were named<br />for John Baptist Rossi,
113195 116823 a Capuchin priest who gave away<br />all his possessions.
119035 121871 A man who had nothing, like you.
122955 127455 Now what is your name,<br />you ungrateful cur?
139764 142349 Your name, boy!
144393 148893 Have you lost your tongue?<br />What is your name?
156364 160864 All the girls will remain<br />locked in their dormitory
161827 164621 and no food will be served<br />to any boy
165289 169789 until you acknowledge<br />your namesake before God.
193317 194901 Food, food, food!
243659 247746 They should name you<br />Simon Magus, the magician.
247913 251708 No. Simon Templar.
263095 264679 Agnes!
266223 267974 Agnes!
274148 276358 Agnes!
285409 287744 -What are you doing?<br />-Agnes!
294960 297170 When they catch you,<br />they'll cane you.
297254 299547 It won't happen,<br />because we're leaving tonight,
299757 302217 this hardy brotherhood,<br />on a crusade.
302384 306429 That's why I risked everything,<br />Agnes, my love, to bid you farewell.
306514 309725 I can't leave you behind<br />without a kiss, can I?
309809 311894 Hey, watch this.
328410 331830 We've lost some girls!<br />The girls are missing!
332373 335334 There are girls missing!<br />Come on, boys, hurry up.
335459 338003 Hurry up!<br />Come on, hurry!
344510 347179 Wait, John Rossi, my kiss.
353477 355687 There he is! Get him!

383132 386760 Elevator to vault on 26th floor<br />requires separate pass key.
387887 391390 Maybe use stairs. No traffic there.
393058 396478 October 4th. Personal tidbits.
396979 400232 Tretiak's former partner<br />died suddenly in 1995.
400649 404194 It left Tretiak the sole owner<br />of gas and oil empire.
405779 409491 Tretiak's first son killed<br />in car crash five years ago.
410826 412327 Who are you?
412494 415955 Vehicle was driven<br />by younger son, llya, now 27.
416123 420085 Wife now lives in Geneva following<br />an assassination attempt in 1996.
420169 423297 -I'm Ivan Ivanovich.<br />-No other children.
423422 427922 October 5th. llya spent most of today<br />in Cafe Eldorado with Bandido buddies.
428344 431555 Gangster rap coffee<br />flirting with teenage girls.
431722 434683 Small firearms in coats,<br />machine pistols in cars.
434892 438437 ...compulsory military service.
439188 442858 Family company employs all four<br />as fix-it guys...
514179 518679 There were three great<br />empires that dominated the world,
519476 522437 both culturally and militarily:
523105 527526 Rome, Constantinople and Russia.
527693 532193 All three have fallen.<br />Only one can be restored.
533323 536701 And only one man can restore it:
536869 540372 Ivan Petrovich Tretiak!
563645 568145 Friends. Countrymen. Russians!
576033 579911 You people here in this room...
580621 583165 are the cream of Russia.
583749 588249 And the whole nation<br />is listening with us.
588545 592048 But why do you all listen to me rave?
592216 596716 Set aside my oil company,<br />forget about my best-selling book,
596929 601429 And all I am is a lunatic<br />haunted by the fantasy
603936 608436 of an empire that reclaims<br />her former might, her former size.
614071 618571 All I am is a poet<br />spinning rhymes of Russia
620369 624869 not cut off at the knees,<br />but armed to the teeth!
627876 631921 Not ridiculed, but revered!
633715 638215 No, more than revered. Feared!
647604 652104 But who am I to dazzle you<br />with this dream? All I've done...
653318 657818 How does it look for the leader's son<br />to walk out when the leader speaks?
659032 663532 You'd prefer the leader's son<br />to piss his pants on live TV?
665497 669542 And still the people<br />freeze to death!
687603 689396 I love this country.
823697 825323 I don't speak Russian.
825907 830407 In that case, stand up,<br />put your hands behind your head
830912 833664 and turn around slowly.
838086 841380 Wrong place for a condom.<br />Take it off.
847971 852471 Listen, if I give this to you,<br />you're gonna give it to your daddy.
853977 857230 And what's he gonna give you?<br />Not even a Christmas bonus.
857397 860316 The guy I'm stealing this for<br />will give me a million dollars.
860484 862819 If we partner,<br />we'll split 50-50,
862903 864738 that's half a million<br />in hard currency.
864946 867573 Think of the drugs<br />you could buy with that much cake.
867741 870577 You'll be discoing for a decade<br />in Moscow, mate.
870869 875290 I don't need your small change.<br />That's your first problem.
876208 877792 Here is your second.
878668 881587 Microchip, please.
883215 887302 -Freeze!<br />-Sorry. Guns make me nervous.
887761 890805 Suck me sideways.
926383 927926 My eyes!
948822 950031 Give it up!
955996 957914 You've got no place to go!
972304 973763 A goddamn button!
983190 985483 Back of the building! Come on!
998371 1002249 -Where's the body?<br />-No body. Just some guy in rags.
1067148 1070776 As the bitter chill of<br />winter descends on Moscow,
1070944 1073363 Russians are warming<br />to the angry rhetoric
1073446 1075906 of former communist boss<br />Ivan Tretiak.
1076449 1080536 Now, a billionaire oil magnate<br />and leader of his own political party,
1080704 1084207 Tretiak predicted that the civil<br />unrest engulfing Russia
1084291 1088753 will only worsen unless reformist<br />President Karpov can overcome
1088837 1093337 the heating oil shortage that has<br />already killed scores of Russians.
1093550 1097887 In his speech today, Tretiak called<br />on elements of the Russian army
1098054 1101807 who are opposed to the elected<br />government, to seize control
1101975 1104102 and end the heating oil crisis...
1104227 1105645 What beautiful work.
1105812 1109816 ...angry siege<br />at the American embassy.
1109983 1114483 Fired by Tretiak's attacks on U.S.<br />foreign policy, the protesters...
1115405 1118533 Cloisonneé. It is old.
1118700 1121494 Yes. It belonged to my grandmother.
1124831 1126249 Please.
1131212 1135007 Tonight I feel like the oldest person<br />on this plane.
1136301 1138970 My husband,<br />he's sending me to England
1139054 1141639 to live until things change.
1141806 1145100 You are married not even a year
1145769 1148646 and already this bastard<br />has a girlfriend!
1149356 1152192 I'm sorry, it's not my business.
1155320 1158448 <i>How come you know<br />SO much about me?</i>
1159157 1160616 It is a gift.
1162619 1165371 I am Martin de Porres.
1165455 1168541 I'm from Spain, but I'm named<br />for a Peruvian saint
1168625 1173125 who could cure the sick<br />or the injured by the laying of hands.
1186768 1190480 He's the same build as the description<br />the Russians gave us,
1190563 1192648 but he doesn't sound<br />like an Aussie.
1196695 1198446 He could be faking it.
1205995 1210207 X-rays are clear, he hasn't<br />swallowed the microchip. Anything?
1210375 1214170 You English with your fish and chips.<br />On the plane I have chicken.
1214337 1218837 Van Gogh theft, Netherlands,<br />last year. Same eyes.
1218967 1220385 Different chin.
1263928 1266221 Halcyon Hotel, sir.
1274856 1278568 Stand up! What is your name?
1278735 1280570 Answer the question!
1282405 1285366 What is your name... Name... Name...
1290663 1294375 Hey, Lou. The microchip arrived.<br />I put the dough in your Swiss account.
1294459 1296294 Sorry I didn't get back to you<br />about the diamonds.
1296377 1298045 But Moscow's like Dodge City now.
1298171 1300381 All them greedy commies have turned<br />into capitalists.
1300465 1302300 It's disgusting.<br />It's made them sloppy.
1303301 1306345 One or two more easy score,<br />I top 50 mill, I'm out of the game.
1306429 1308597 -Yeah, I heard that before.<br />-Not from me.
1308765 1311517 I don't know nothing. If you don't<br />believe me, try and find me.
1311601 1313519 -Fuck you, Lou!<br />-Cheers.
1318817 1320902 I can't seem to break 50.
1372370 1375873 "One million U.S. dollars,<br />non-refundable...
1376040 1380540 "reserves you a quiet table<br />at a romantic little spot in Berlin

1437018 1439395 took a vow of poverty<br />and became a hermit

1461084 1462502 Youth.
1467131 1471631 Who runs this thief?<br />CIA? MI-67? Libya?
1472345 1475890 He's not a race car, nobody runs him.<br />He's an independent contractor.
1476140 1479434 Good. Then no one will mind<br />if I kill him.
1480311 1484811 Yes, I can have a man killed<br />and stroll away like that.
1485650 1489904 Even with metal detectors.<br />Even in this transit lounge.
1492991 1497036 It's so early. You guys want<br />to get some coffee or something?
1498496 1499955 Sure.
1503584 1505419 Be quiet.
1505545 1508130 What is it you request<br />of my employer?
1508297 1512050 -Do you know what cold fusion is?<br />-Of course.
1512760 1516805 It's the theory of nuclear fusion<br />at room temperature.
1516973 1519725 -Free energy forever.<br />-Yes.
1523354 1527191 As far as science goes,<br />it ranks just above astrology.
1527358 1529318 Those who claim<br />to have achieved it,
1529402 1531612 have never been able to duplicate it.
1531779 1533238 Until now.
1534782 1538660 There is an electrochemist<br />working at Oxford.
1539078 1543578 We believe that this good lady<br />made a breakthrough in cold fusion.
1544375 1548337 Your employer will obtain<br />the formula for me.
1548504 1551715 He's very busy.<br />And you're very boring.
1552258 1554051 Your offer must inspire him.
1554677 1556929 This woman has repeatedly avoided
1557013 1560307 my agents' attempts<br />to find the formula.
1560600 1563060 She's cagey, difficult.
1563978 1566897 Maybe your agents are stupid.
1570735 1575114 I think this inspiration<br />would cost you three million dollars.
1576074 1578367 -Ridiculous.<br />-Why?
1578493 1581621 You'll have the world market<br />in energy.
1581704 1585999 Cost you a nickel for every million<br />you make. His deposit should go...
1586667 1590295 It is not for me.<br />It is for Mother Russia.
1590963 1594299 But you want Mother Russia too,<br />Mr. Tretiak.
1594467 1598846 Three million on deposit<br />in a bank account in Zurich. Agreed?
1600306 1601724 Yes.
1602475 1606975 And how long to get<br />your employer's agreement?
1607563 1608772 I'll ask.
1623996 1626790 Your offer has inspired her.<br />I'll do it.
1628543 1631295 Bank account number in Zurich.
1632880 1635507 -Bye, sonny.<br />-Bye-bye.
1636884 1639553 I really love this guy.
1644267 1648229 -Too bad we have to kill him.<br />-Yeah, too bad.
1663119 1667619 When the electro-chemists Hans<br />and Fleischman announced in 1989
1668624 1671501 that they had discovered cold fusion,
1671919 1675464 a revolutionary process<br />of generating energy,
1676174 1679719 They were at first<br />acclaimed as geniuses,
1679886 1682430 and then condemned as charlatans.
1683764 1686641 The protocols of cold fusion...
1686809 1688852 What are those? Drugs?
1689020 1693482 Can I have one? My head is pounding.<br />She's boring the life out of me.
1695359 1697152 They're for my heart.
1698696 1702533 You have very pretty eyes.<br />Pretty lady.
1702700 1704326 -Who are you?<br />-Me?
1704493 1706912 I'm here to do an interview<br />with that Dr. Russell.
1707079 1709623 I'm gonna expose her as a fraud.
1709790 1713293 You don't put any stock in this<br />cold fusion mumbo-jumbo, do you?
1713461 1714879 -Actually, I do.<br />-Really?
1715046 1717673 Dr. Emma Russell!
1731145 1735645 Well, I didn't prepare<br />any formal remarks.
1737443 1740821 I'm more interested<br />in what questions you all have
1740905 1742323 about cold fusion.
1742490 1746118 So I thought we would start<br />with those. Any questions?
1749372 1752166 -Please?<br />-Yeah, I have, Dr. Russell.
1752750 1757250 Can you explain the actual process<br />of fusion? You know, the theory?
1758214 1760299 Yes. There it is.
1761300 1763719 This is the apparatus.
1764470 1768891 And very simply,<br />when positively charged deuterons
1769058 1771477 are attracted<br />to the palladium cathode,
1771978 1773521 they cram together.
1773604 1778104 There are millions and millions<br />of them getting closer and closer,
1778276 1782776 and then they fuse. And they create<br />energy in the form of helium.
1783197 1787326 But I read that the experiment<br />couldn't be replicated. So...
1787952 1791372 -How do we know it works?<br />-Well, we don't.
1792290 1793708 Not yet.
1794667 1799167 But if you remember, Einstein knew<br />the theory of relativity to be true
1799630 1803216 long before he could prove it.<br />He felt the truth.
1803926 1808305 And some of us feel the same way<br />about cold fusion.
1808472 1810724 Because it's there, it's in nature,
1810891 1815270 the raw, natural power<br />just waiting to be harnessed.
1815438 1819938 And when we ignite<br />that cold fusion fire,
1820192 1822694 I mean, just imagine...
1823529 1827157 There's more energy<br />in one cubic mile of sea water
1827325 1830328 than in all the known<br />oil reserves on Earth.
1830953 1835453 You could drive your car 55 million<br />miles on a gallon of heavy water.
1837460 1841960 It would be the end of pollution.<br />Warmth for the whole world.
1844300 1847553 So why don't I demonstrate for you
1848095 1851890 why other people in the past<br />have been so unsuccessful?
1853559 1854977 They use very complex...

2018015 2019683 She's innocent.
2026398 2028400 Maybe it's in her head.
2029777 2031570 She needs a poet.
2032238 2033530 An artist.
2034698 2039198 Someone who understands truth.
2047086 2048337 She needs Thomas Moore.
2095801 2097385 Do you like it?
2099930 2103725 -What?<br />-The sculpture. Do you like it?
2106937 2108480 Yes.
2108772 2110982 What do you love about it?
2120367 2124867 The way it... glows.
2126624 2131124 And how the light<br />holds him in silence,
2133464 2135549 taking care of him.
2137176 2139595 Yeah, that's what I like about it.
2143390 2145809 -Are you an artist?<br />-No.
2146310 2150480 Just a traveler<br />searching for purity.
2151565 2154192 -What do you search for?<br />-Energy.
2154360 2155569 Yes.
2158822 2161741 Have you ever been<br />on a long journey?
2161909 2164494 No, not really.
2166330 2170334 Perhaps I'll take you<br />to my home in Africa.
2171710 2176210 You should experience the energy<br />of where all life began.
2181637 2184973 Sorry, I'm not very good with people.
2189228 2190896 Me neither.
2219633 2222385 "I see my angel for the first time.
2222553 2225847 "Know my purpose, feel my birth.
2226724 2230144 Then distinctly,
2230310 2233730 "The sweet strains of our union,
2233897 2237483 "Our love heats up the cold universe
2237651 2240654 "And gives my tired,<br />desperate heart..."
2243157 2246160 ...are eternally healed.
2248245 2251706 -Do you like it?<br />-Who did you write it for?
2252291 2253792 You.
2254126 2257629 You're following me or it's destiny.
2257796 2262133 -Either way, it's weird.<br />-Very weird.
2264261 2265971 Destiny, then.
2276982 2278942 This must look strange.
2280152 2284406 It's something that I'm working on.
2284990 2289490 A formula for creating energy.
2290496 2292915 That you carry around<br />in your underwear?
2294249 2297669 Yeah. I do.
2310766 2312726 How did you do that?
2314311 2315562 Magic.
2316438 2317856 Give it back.
2318816 2321777 - It looks like Sanskrit.<br />-Give it back.
2324488 2327365 I'm sorry. I just wanted<br />to watch you put it away.
2329952 2333997 -What else do you keep in there?<br />-Nothing.
2334164 2335915 That's not true.
2337084 2339795 Can I get you anything else?
2342089 2343423 Drink your wine.
2344174 2346467 Latour '57.
2348178 2351848 The Latour, sir,<br />is 400 pounds a bottle.
2356061 2358188 Then we'll have two bottles.
2361567 2363402 There, you count it.
2369950 2373036 All these little tubes and microbes.
2373453 2376622 -And molecules.<br />-Those too.
2376790 2381290 -Can I tell you something?<br />-What? You must. Everything.
2382045 2385339 -It's a secret.<br />-What?
2387134 2388718 I'm done.
2391346 2395058 My energy research, I'm finished.
2395309 2397894 I still have some sequencing<br />to work out
2398061 2402106 to make sure that it's safe,<br />but I did it.
2402691 2405527 It's been you<br />against the whole world, hasn't it?
2406445 2408655 How have you done it<br />and stayed so positive?
2408739 2411074 The gift of faith.
2412618 2414953 To see...
2416288 2420788 Well, to believe in something<br />that's all around us
2422252 2425088 but hidden from our sight.
2426214 2428382 It's a beautiful thought.
2428467 2430635 I can't believe<br />I'm telling you all this.
2431762 2433764 I don't even know your name.
2434806 2436766 My name is...
2437684 2441396 I don't want to tell you my name.<br />No, I don't want to do that.
2443273 2446401 I don't want to do that.<br />What difference does it make?
2448528 2451864 -What's your name?<br />-Emma.
2452032 2455785 Emma. Now I know<br />everything about you.
2457412 2459997 You're a genius.
2462584 2464419 You have a weak heart.
2467506 2469925 You have beautiful dreams.
2470092 2471927 Great courage.
2472719 2475138 Unafraid in this world.
2475305 2477348 You get that from your father.
2479434 2482270 You can't cook to save your life.
2483313 2484897 And you love fish.
2487234 2489110 I do love fish.
2489736 2491571 That's weird.
2492155 2494740 -I want to try that.<br />-No.
2494908 2498036 -Yes.<br />-I don't want you to. Drink your wine.
2499997 2504042 Yes, I do.<br />What's your name?
2505293 2507753 My name is Thomas Moore.
2507921 2511549 I was named after a saint...
2512718 2516471 who died for his faith.
2518390 2520058 Okay.
2522144 2523854 Your work...
2524730 2528567 is very dangerous and alive.
2529609 2533696 And I love your poems.<br />They move me.
2535490 2538159 But that's not who you really are.
2539119 2543619 You're running away<br />from your past and your pain
2545250 2549254 and yet you keep it so close to you.
2552340 2555843 You don't have to be afraid<br />of who you are...
2557387 2559806 because you're beautiful.
2618490 2619741 What are you doing?
2637634 2642134 Oh, my God, you're bleeding!<br />What happened?
2642430 2646930 I don't know,<br />I was weeping and I slipped.
2647853 2650188 I was thinking of you,<br />I don't know...
2650355 2654400 Well, I live right down the street,<br />I could clean you up.
2656069 2657570 Why do you cover your mouth<br />when you laugh?
2657737 2659280 -I don't know.<br />-Wait.
2663660 2668160 I'm glad that it stopped bleeding.<br />You don't need stitches.
2675297 2677215 We have to disinfect it, though.
2678216 2679926 You really are an angel.
2681178 2682596 You are.
2685515 2687266 This is gonna hurt.
2689394 2691104 I'm sorry.
2693315 2697027 -I'm sorry. Are you all right?<br />-Yeah.
2698278 2700655 I'm sorry, I was just joking.
2701740 2705493 - I should go.<br />-No.
2705660 2708079 Yes, you... I...
2708955 2712249 -Take off your pants.<br />-Pardon?
2712417 2714210 I mean, your sweater.
2717547 2720508 There's blood on it. I'll wash it.
2725180 2726848 You're very domestic.
2728558 2732103 There's blood on your blouse<br />as well.
2734481 2736107 I'll wash it.
2750580 2752123 Do you have any wine?
2764886 2769140 I'm so overwhelmed<br />that you even noticed me.
2770225 2772268 How could I not?
2773603 2776230 You make me feel so good.
2776398 2777941 I wish...
2778900 2781027 I wish you could understand.
2782612 2784864 I want you to know who I am.
2802424 2804259 Oh, my heart.
2805010 2808096 Don't disappear, I'll be right back.
2840003 2843172 You can't do this.<br />She's so great.
2843340 2847218 I can't believe this is happening.<br />I can't believe this is happening.
2873995 2875538 Hi.
2892263 2896763 "To Spider. Must fly.<br />Have better offer."
2897769 2900521 Greedy Westerner.<br />Wants more money.
2900688 2904566 Who cares?<br />Can't spend hard currency in hell.
2906820 2911320 Send this message:<br />"Fly. Don't buzz off.
2913368 2915620 "I'll double your fee.
2916913 2921413 "Or send my own boys<br />to take care of the woman."
2929300 2930884 Are you okay?
2934180 2937474 I just want to lie here.
2940145 2942856 Can we just be like this tonight?
2944691 2946859 Is that what you want?
2947485 2949403 It's so magic.
2955076 2957411 It just feels so perfect.
2988067 2990611 It's 7:00 a.m.<br />and here are the news headlines...
2999662 3001288 Thomas?
3077907 3082036 -Lev Naumovitch! It's here.<br />-It's revolutionary, sir.
3082203 3085164 She's boldly cast aside<br />a slew of stale ideas.
3085331 3088876 But I think the formula<br />is incomplete. It will take months...
3089043 3090377 But that won't do.
3090461 3093297 Now that the people<br />are beginning to freeze,
3093381 3097134 Tretiak must swoop in from the wings<br />with a miracle to save them.
3097302 3100388 -How high do you want it?<br />-To the top.
3100930 3103098 -Good morning, Yuri.<br />-Good morning.
3103600 3107895 Perhaps I can confirm the validity<br />of this formula more quickly
3108187 3111565 if I dispense<br />with certain protocols. But...
3111733 3115945 How long, Dr. Botvin, since you<br />received your last salary check
3116029 3118698 from Moscow University?
3119115 3121867 Ukrainian Independence Day.
3122910 3124286 Last August.
3126497 3128957 Ivan, he's online.
3131294 3132420 Do it.
3136424 3140678 "To Spider. You've got the recipe..."
3140845 3144390 -"Where's my dough?"<br />-"To Human Fly.
3145350 3149850 "Recipe incomplete.<br />The cake won't rise.
3151314 3153816 "Hence, no dough."
3160907 3165244 -"I'm not the baker."<br />-"Don't make me the butcher."
3167580 3169415 I like this guy.
3173670 3176547 "No play, no pay.
3176714 3180175 “I'm certain you kept the cookbook."
3188935 3189977 Holland Park.
3205702 3209080 I'll check that for you. Yes,<br />that seems to be fine. One moment.
3219757 3221550 He's keeping me online.
3231561 3233062 You wait here.
3276355 3279316 You! Beside the car!
3279901 3283779 Now turn around!<br />Step away from the vehicle!
3283946 3285280 He's armed!
3308471 3309972 Come on, drive!
3319273 3321650 Go the other way! Go!
3334622 3335956 What about him?
3344090 3346008 What about this one?
3350304 3352597 Yeah, that...
3352765 3356059 You see, we believe<br />they're all the same villain.
3360773 3362357 Oh, my God.
3364610 3368196 -They're all him?<br />-We believe so.
3368781 3371950 He eluded a hit squad<br />this morning in Holland Park.
3373578 3375913 Then he fled the UK out of Heathrow.
3376080 3378624 We've got a handful of<br />false identities used on
3378791 3381376 visas, passports, leases...
3382879 3385631 Nicholas Owen.<br />Louis Guanella.
3386048 3387591 Peter Damian.
3388801 3390469 Charles Borromeo.
3391637 3393305 Of course.
3394056 3398556 Thomas Moore.<br />All the names of Catholic saints.
3402231 3406731 Can you access Heathrow's passenger<br />lists for the last... eight hours?
3408446 3411240 - I think it might be possible.<br />-Good.
3439226 3441353 Yes!
3452198 3453199 Yes!
3465461 3469961 See, my friends,<br />you back the biggest rat.
3496742 3500328 Out! Out! Freeloaders, out!
3500705 3504291 I want to drink alone.<br />Close the curtain!
3527189 3529107 -What?<br />-What?
3530985 3532611 Don't look down.
3533779 3537115 -Do you know who I am?<br />-No.
3537908 3540619 I'm the thief you tried to cheat.
3541495 3543914 And this is your accountant.
3546459 3547877 Talk to him.
3550921 3553506 The phone goes the other way,<br />you moron.
3556761 3560097 Hello? Tretiak speaking.
3561015 3565185 That money to Zurich, send it now.
3565603 3567313 I said now.
3568606 3569898 Yeah.
3572526 3573944 Thank you.
3574987 3578198 Do you know what the hardest part<br />about being you is?
3578783 3581535 Pretending to be so bad in bed.
3583329 3585539 You son of a bitch!
3586415 3588750 There is an impostor in there!<br />Get him out!
3588918 3591337 Hey, hey. Hey.
3591504 3595174 Take your hands off me, you idiots!
3595341 3599841 Are you crazy? It's me!<br />Go! Get him! Go!
3600596 3602556 Ilya, get the bastard!
3625162 3627372 Fifty million. I'm out.
3630292 3634087 Mr. Ferrer, checking out.
3644265 3646100 I'll have one too.
3648144 3650062 -Emma
3651730 3654733 I am... I'm overwhelmed.
3656569 3659196 -You found me.<br />-It wasn't very hard.
3660573 3663659 Two men with saints' names<br />flew into Moscow yesterday.
3664535 3668330 Isadore Bakanja<br />is a short, bald African.
3668622 3670498 Whereas Vincent Ferrer...
3670666 3673001 Named after a saint<br />who betrayed his best friend.
3673127 3674920 How could you do it?
3675796 3680258 Emma, I had to.
3681635 3684721 -I'm a thief.<br />-I want my cards back.
3685264 3687599 You flew all this way<br />because you want your cards?
3687683 3690936 -Yes, I did.<br />-No. It's because you're in love.
3695149 3697734 -I rest my case.<br />-Who are you?
3697860 3700237 No one has a clue, least of all me.
3701238 3705738 And why would you steal<br />cold fusion? It's free.
3707536 3709204 Why would you do that?
3710748 3714918 -Eight million reasons.<br />-Eight million? Is that all?
3716837 3721337 I would have given them to you<br />if you'd only asked.
3728390 3729849 You've got to get away from me.
3729934 3733228 I'm not going anywhere<br />until you tell me why you lied to me.
3733312 3735939 -You lied to me.<br />- I lied to you?
3736023 3738692 You almost got me killed. The guy<br />I stole it for says it doesn't work.
3738776 3742446 -Well, screw him!<br />- I don't think you'd enjoy that.
3743155 3745448 Yeah, you're right,<br />I don't think I would.
3752748 3755834 Emma, you don't know<br />what you're dealing with here.
3767554 3771015 -They took my pills.<br />-No, I palmed them from your purse.
3771350 3775850 I need one or two, I need...<br />I have a bad heart and...
3776855 3779649 -I know.<br />-It's starting to pound.
3779817 3784317 It's okay, I've got your pills.<br />I've got two in my hand.
3785155 3788283 -I'm gonna pass out.<br />-Sit down on the floor.
3790494 3793163 Just get down on the floor.<br />That's right.
3793330 3796708 That's right, eat two out of my hand.<br />That's right.
3797251 3798669 Okay?
3799503 3801296 While you're down there...
3803924 3806384 Get the pocketknife out of my boot.
3808512 3812349 This formula makes<br />certain assumptions
3812474 3816644 which contradict all we know<br />about cold fusion cathodes.
3816812 3821312 Testing at any level becomes futile<br />without any further information.
3821483 3822775 Mr. Tretiak.
3822943 3827443 Don't despair, Dr. Botvin.<br />Help is here.
3838792 3841002 The two came very quietly.
3849511 3852514 And they left even more quietly.
3854016 3857185 Close the city. Kill him.
3857644 3860605 And bring her alive.
3875079 3877790 Why are they after me?
3877873 3882043 Tretiak, the guy I worked for,<br />owns this city. Cops and all.
3882169 3885839 We have to convince him there's<br />nothing more he wants from you.
3886715 3888591 What do you want from me?
3895224 3898143 -Everything's on those cards?<br />-Yes.
3898310 3902105 -So the formula works?<br />-Kiss me again.
3904733 3907485 -No.<br />-Make up your mind.
3907653 3912153 I... I have to figure out the order<br />before the formula works.
3912658 3915786 -I'm not gonna give it to him.<br />-Tretiak will find you.
3915953 3919081 -No.<br />-He found me, and that's very hard.
3919248 3922709 - I found you.<br />-Yes, you did.
3924044 3925545 What do you need?
3929133 3932511 I need some time, and I need...
3935013 3936848 I need a place to work.
3940769 3944272 -Where's everyone going?<br />-To their country relatives.
3945023 3948067 To cut firewood.<br />There's no heat in this city.
3958120 3960413 How long will it take you<br />to finish the formula?
3960581 3961873 I don't know.
3961957 3966294 -Two hours maybe. I don't know.<br />-It should be enough time...
3966753 3970256 to get our passports together<br />and for us to get married.
3970883 3973010 -We're getting married?<br />-Yes.
3974761 3978014 I want you to be<br />Mrs. Martin de Porres.
3981977 3984396 -You're not Martin.<br />-No.
3985898 3987441 Who are you?
3990527 3992070 I don't have a name.
3993655 3995114 Sad.
3995282 3999369 -Will you have one when we get home?<br />-I don't have a home.
4000037 4003331 When we get back, you do<br />the science, I'll do the math.
4003415 4007377 We'll market your formula around<br />the world, we'll make a fortune.
4008003 4011464 And then... we'll see.
4023560 4025061 Emma!
4042496 4044706 No trouble, okay?
4048126 4051087 If you want to live,<br />never leave my side.
4177964 4179590 I've got you.
4185430 4186848 Come on.
4191478 4193021 Here we go.
4196608 4198651 Now we've got to get you warm.
4207327 4209037 Come on, almost there.
4233437 4236815 Come on, come on.
4243447 4246241 You'll wait<br />till Christ comes to Moscow.
4246867 4251288 Elevator was made of mahogany.<br />Tenants used it for firewood.
4251455 4255955 We need your help.<br />He fell in the river. He's freezing.
4256543 4259504 -We're just people who...<br />-You're not people.
4260338 4262882 -You're Americans.<br />-Yes.
4263049 4265718 But we ran into trouble<br />with your Mafia.
4297459 4301504 She disapproves of what I do,<br />but eats the bread it buys.
4304299 4308177 No heat for sale, but these clothes<br />will make you warm.
4314184 4318563 I said "Mashenka, go back to bed."<br />She's always puttering around.
4322067 4324903 It's here. Built to escape...
4325737 4328239 the Secret Police. In you go.
4342504 4344464 You've got hypothermia.
4344798 4347717 We've have to get<br />these wet clothes off...
4348510 4350178 and keep you warm.
4350804 4353264 They must be<br />in one of these buildings.
4353348 4355016 Check every apartment.
4356810 4360271 How are you doing?<br />Talk to me.
4360438 4362731 Snug as a bug in a rug.
4372617 4377117 We're gonna have to do this<br />before your body temperature falls
4379207 4381375 below 95 degrees.
4394347 4397266 Two kids talking about foreigners.
4406151 4408570 Listen to me, tenants!
4408904 4413404 Show me where the Americans are.<br />You'll be paid in American dollars.
4415118 4418246 Five hundred bucks reward.
4420373 4423417 Have you seen by chance<br />two Americans?
4423585 4428085 Just one American and one polar bear.<br />Do I get 2507
4449903 4451404 We'll check upstairs.
4463792 4465668 What's your name?
4468088 4470215 Who are you really?
4471967 4474761 -Simon.<br />-Simon?
4475387 4479887 -So you were named for a saint.<br />-No, Simon the magician.
4481101 4484687 I did tricks. Tricks for Agnes.
4485772 4489025 That's how I got things.<br />Priests took everything.
4489359 4493859 Took Agnes. Dog's too big... Teeth...
4496366 4499702 She fell. I escaped.
4500954 4502747 I always escape.
4503540 4506042 I don't believe in magic anymore.
4507585 4509253 I do.
4511673 4514342 I've never felt like this before.
4515760 4517136 How?
4518096 4519680 I'm freezing.
4524227 4528648 These are here!<br />These Americans are here!
4530859 4532819 These are here!
4533319 4537239 We've got to get out of here.<br />Are you okay? They're coming.
4539034 4542037 The Americans are here!
4542203 4544538 Hurry, put this on.
4550462 4551963 Here they are!
4565226 4566518 Upstairs!
4584913 4586539 Maybe we can jump.
4587332 4588708 Let's jump.
4593296 4594588 Run!
4638675 4640510 We need her alive, idiot!
4643179 4645181 The embassy's east of here.
4664075 4668496 You're late. Where have you been?<br />I've been waiting two hours.
4668663 4673163 I've got some beautiful paintings<br />for you to buy. In here, come on.
4678798 4681801 Don't fret,<br />it's just my curator, Toli.
4682093 4683552 I'm Alexa Frankievitch.
4683970 4686722 But being you're Americans,<br />you can call me Frankie.
4686806 4690351 -Okay, I've got money. We want...<br />- I know.
4690643 4693020 The icon of the Virgin of the Don.
4693188 4695398 -Are those maps of the tunnels?<br />-Yes.
4695481 4698317 We're not here to buy art.<br />Take us to the American embassy.
4698484 4701862 Right. I need 10,000 dollars up front.
4701946 4702947 No.
4703031 4707368 Okay, 7,000, and not a penny less.
4716920 4720089 -Police?<br />-No. Tretiak's goons.
4729933 4733394 -Wait!<br />-Sasha, go east, to the embassy.
4733478 4735605 -Are we lost?<br />-What's wrong?
4735688 4738774 You're in Russia.<br />Everything's complicated.
4739108 4742236 -But you know the way?<br />-Like the face of a...
4742403 4744363 Bulgari chronograph.
4753748 4755875 I remember. This way.
4760630 4765130 At last, water main. They shut it<br />down each afternoon in winter.
4766302 4770431 -What time do they turn it back on?<br />-You have five minutes.
4770598 4772474 -Plus or minus.<br />-Plus or minus?
4772642 4775227 It means several minutes<br />earlier or later.
4775311 4778647 Don't worry.<br />Third opening is under your embassy.
4796457 4798250 Quick, someone's coming.
4804299 4806926 Come on, come on.
4815268 4818813 Here's the second one.<br />Embassy's next.
4822108 4825736 -About two more minutes.<br />-Yeah, unless it's minus.
4829657 4832660 Damn! It's sealed.
4833244 4836872 -We'll have to go back.<br />-Come on.
4861481 4862940 Hurry!
4872241 4873617 Up you go!
4904816 4907652 The embassy's only<br />about a hundred yards away.
4907777 4909028 There's a car right above us.
4910488 4911864 Watch your head.
4945106 4949606 I'll create a diversion. Should take<br />you ten seconds to run to the gates.
4949944 4951820 They'll open them<br />when they see you coming.
4953114 4955825 -Okay, I can do that.<br />-You can do it.
4956784 4960579 Wait. When am I gonna see you?
4960663 4963415 I'll find you. You found me.
4963499 4965042 Yeah, I did.
5027313 5031650 I'm an American! Open the gate!<br />Open the gate.
5034278 5037114 Back off from the gate! Back off!
5037198 5039617 I said back off!
5040701 5043412 Stand back from the gate.
5045665 5047583 I said back off!
5059971 5063224 She out-ran you? How humiliating.
5067728 5070814 One shot left.
5072775 5076653 Can't come all the way to Russia<br />and not play Russian roulette.
5077530 5080658 Before you shoot me, don't you want<br />to know where all the money's hidden?
5081909 5084494 -Whose money?<br />-Tretiak's, yours.
5084704 5087206 He treats you like dirt.<br />You could have it all.
5087373 5091043 -What are you saying?<br />-Your father's stashed billions.
5091210 5094004 And I know where it's hidden.<br />Let's make a deal.
5095464 5097966 Where are all those hidden billions?
5098718 5100177 I know.
5101137 5103180 But I don't think I'm gonna tell you.
5135129 5139383 You're worse than all the others.<br />However, the burns will heal.
5140176 5144676 Maybe a little chance of scarring.<br />But I'd say he's a very lucky boy.
5145890 5150390 Lucky?<br />Look at me, I'm a damn devil.
5156942 5161321 I have run every test<br />on this cold fusion formula,
5161405 5165905 and must conclude that it is not<br />merely incomplete, but impossible.
5168287 5172374 You may as well try to create<br />perpetual motion, Mr. Tretiak.
5173000 5175335 I invest millions,
5177046 5179882 and you can't make it work!
5183594 5186305 What are you doing with my money?
5188808 5193308 Do you think it comes so easy? No!
5194438 5198938 Sir, I have been working<br />for nearly two weeks without sleep.
5201112 5205449 At first blush, the theorem appears<br />quite impressive. Convincing.
5205533 5207034 It does?
5211747 5215792 Yes, it does.
5216627 5220547 Good man. We can use it<br />to destroy our enemies.
5222425 5225803 Only Dr. Russell can spoil my plan.
5225970 5228806 If she gets back to London<br />and speaks to the press.
5228889 5233389 From here to the airport are three<br />army checkpoints, all loyal to us.
5234562 5239062 Make sure they all get the message.<br />She doesn't leave Moscow alive.
5242153 5246532 Mr. President, as former<br />Vice Minister of Energy and Power,
5247032 5251532 I hear all manner of schemes<br />that provide cheaper energy.
5251871 5254915 And as our countrymen<br />freeze to death,
5255624 5259002 I've become aware of<br />a marvelous new technology,
5259170 5263670 about which I'm hopelessly out of<br />my league from a scientific viewpoint.
5264925 5267844 That's why I brought<br />our eminent physicist here,
5268012 5271348 Dr. Lev Botvin<br />from the University of Moscow.
5271515 5276015 Before we are dazzled by the good<br />news, let's dispense with the bad.
5276896 5278981 What is the price of this marvel?
5279148 5282484 The cost of research<br />and development are there,
5282568 5284945 which is all<br />you are asked to defray.
5291243 5294037 Ten billion in hard currency?
5294121 5298291 I can't even pay my teachers,<br />my miners, my doctors.
5306008 5307884 Where are you heading?
5308385 5311596 I thought we'd drink some vodka<br />to get warmer.
5316185 5320685 Like the miracle of socialism,<br />our miracle of cold fusion failed.
5322358 5326858 But no matter. We have sold<br />cold fusion to President Karpov.
5327947 5331408 We will use the scandal<br />of his failure to destroy him.
5331575 5334244 The army must be mobilized<br />by midnight tomorrow.
5334328 5337998 You're in a hurry, Ivan Petrovich.<br />That's one day.
5338207 5340459 Not now, old witch, we're working.
5341627 5346127 Think of it. In one day you can be<br />proud again to be a Russian general.
5348926 5352763 With a big nuclear missile<br />where your prick used to be.
5353722 5355890 You have to fill out a form<br />before we put you on a flight.
5356058 5357851 Medical problems, that sort of thing.
5358018 5361980 -I have a heart condition.<br />-Do you need any medication?
5363023 5367193 Well, I haven't needed a pill.<br />That's strange.
5367361 5370530 Get a form from down the corridor.<br />I'll be back in ten.
5370698 5374201 -I'll be by your side to the airport.<br />-Thank you.
5376704 5378497 ...where overnight a mob attacked
5378581 5381375 several companies<br />with ties to America.
5381542 5385379 Apparently, four U.S. citizens<br />were badly injured in the attack.
5385546 5389925 I'm told that American citizens are<br />asked to report to the U.S. embassy
5390092 5392677 for immediate evacuation...
5392845 5396598 -Excuse me, lady, you look lost.<br />-No, I'm fine.
5396765 5401265 May I help you? Allow me to introduce<br />myself. My name is August Christopher,
5402605 5406066 I was named after Saint Augustin,<br />who coined my favorite phrase:
5406233 5410320 "Give me chastity and constancy,<br />but do not give it yet."
5415367 5418620 Simon, I'm on the next flight<br />out of here.
5419163 5420622 Are you coming with me?
5420706 5423500 No. But they are.
5429924 5433719 I need you to develop<br />a sudden fear of flying.
5433802 5438302 Find a quiet room, finish the formula<br />and fax it back to me.
5439058 5440434 My number's on the back.
5440517 5444562 I don't understand.<br />Why are you keeping my cards?
5444897 5448025 We've got to do a deal with<br />the Russians or you'll never be safe.
5448359 5449902 Be good at school.
5451070 5452362 Wait!
5454156 5456950 -Don't you trust me, darling?<br />-Trust who?
5458077 5461080 -That hurts, Emma.<br />-I'm serious.
5461246 5465124 -What's your name?<br />-My name is August Christopher.
5465292 5468169 Of course I trust you,<br />August Christopher.
5468253 5470421 I mean, Vincent Ferrer.
5470506 5472799 I mean, Martin de Porres.
5473968 5475803 Thomas Moore.
5477012 5479848 After all, you are my personal saint.
5480766 5485266 You have to be very good and usually<br />very dead to become a saint.
5486105 5489191 And more importantly,<br />you have to work three miracles.
5489858 5493945 Now get to work.<br />Who's that man?
5494530 5497199 You're leaving on the transport<br />at 9 o'clock, ma'am?
5497449 5501494 Probably your last chance<br />out of here. Hurry, it's leaving.
5503956 5506625 The troops will depose the President
5506709 5509920 and install Ivan Tretiak as leader<br />of Russia.
5510087 5514341 Moscow must be ringed with tanks<br />by early evening.
5514717 5519217 Don't worry, the people will follow<br />me. They'll be crying for revolution.
5519972 5521723 Still no one's guessed
5521807 5524935 the simple truth<br />of where the heating oil went.
5528772 5533272 Who would believe the sea of oil was<br />hidden under this very building?
5536572 5539116 Yuri, I understand your Natalia is...
5539241 5541660 Francis, you devil.
5541827 5543995 I heard you came down here<br />and you didn't call me.
5545581 5547457 Give me a ring, Charles...
5547708 5550502 Lou, I've heard<br />on the grapevine
5550627 5553713 that you're brokering<br />a revolutionary new energy source.
5554840 5557092 If it's as good as<br />it's cracked up to be,
5557176 5560053 I have friends<br />who can double your best offer.
5560429 5564929 On deposit, in Zurich, within one<br />hour of delivery and confirmation.
5566101 5567727 I'll be waiting.
5588665 5592460 The work could be here.<br />This machine could work, couldn't it?
5595130 5596840 Who are you?
5597007 5600343 -A friend of Dr. Russell's.<br />-Dr. Russell...
5602387 5605973 What's this equation?<br />It's so simple, it's...
5607559 5611020 -The key to Dr. Russell's formula.<br />-Yes.
5612731 5615150 The alarm! You had better go.
5615609 5619195 I need a miracle.<br />You've got 12 hours.
5620906 5625406 -But Mr. Tretiak's rally is tonight.<br />-Can you make it work? Make it work.
5632167 5634919 -What is wrong here?<br />-It's the alarm.
5640175 5641885 I tripped.
5650227 5652395 You are Nikolai Petrovich.
5654148 5657651 You are Nikolai Protrovich...<br />Petrovich.
5668078 5670580 Tunnel built by KGB.
5672624 5674876 Leads to machine room in Kremlin.
5675043 5678463 Great. Do you happen to know<br />where the President's quarters are?
5679256 5683176 President Karpov is... there.
5683802 5686262 But there are many guards.
5686597 5689349 -So I suggest...<br />-An alternate route?
5689558 5692352 Money. Now.
5694271 5696231 Oh, ye of little faith.
5699776 5704276 Russia stands tonight<br />on the brink of a second revolution
5704573 5707117 as the number of deaths<br />from freezing mounts,
5707284 5710745 hundreds of thousands of protestors<br />have taken to the streets.
5710913 5714875 Even as Russian President Karpov<br />is promising a mysterious solution
5715042 5717044 to the crippling heating oil shortage,
5717211 5721548 troops opposed to the elected<br />government led by General Leo Sklarov,
5721715 5724426 have begun to ring<br />the Russian capital city.
5724593 5726553 Angry, frightened citizens
5726637 5729264 are gathering outside the Kremlin<br />in Red Square.
5729473 5733351 But they're not braving the cold<br />for yet another a political rally.
5733518 5736604 They've been drawn here<br />by the promise of a revelation,
5736772 5738190 whatever that may be,
5738357 5740567 in what's become<br />a life and death struggle
5740734 5743820 for the future of democracy<br />in Russia.
5819813 5823149 -Mr. President, I'm your friend.<br />-What do you want?
5825902 5830402 I want to help you to destroy Tretiak.<br />I need you to listen for 30 seconds.
5833076 5835536 I'm all right! Stay outside.
5835704 5837789 Please, continue.
5837873 5841084 Tonight you're going to stand trial<br />on Red Square before the world.
5841168 5844504 Whatever Tretiak accuses you of,<br />I need you to admit to it.
5844963 5849463 -Agree with this criminal?<br />-If you want to destroy Tretiak, yes.
5866151 5870446 Gruschev, take Mr. Karpov downstairs.<br />The wife stays here.
5871823 5875535 Hands off!<br />What you are doing is illegal.
5875702 5879163 -The people won't stand for it!<br />-They are too cold to stop it.
5879247 5880831 Who are you?
5913198 5917698 Friends! Countrymen! Russians!
5929089 5933426 You heard about this morning's<br />sensational event.
5933593 5938093 Shocking documents were recovered<br />from the president's secret files,
5939099 5941643 locked within his private safe.
5942394 5946606 The documents, which will be<br />published in today's papers,
5946690 5951190 prove that the traitor Karpov<br />was about to steal
5953363 5957617 over 40 trillion<br />of our precious Russian rubles
5957701 5961413 in a reckless scheme<br />to save his hide!
5962497 5966997 To add insult, millions of dollars<br />were to be paid
5968044 5970421 to this international criminal!
5977971 5982471 And for what was your president hoping<br />to bankrupt our national treasury?
5984019 5988519 What you see is the fairy tale<br />called cold fusion.
5989900 5994321 You pass electric current<br />into the machine,
5994404 5998449 and there is supposed to be<br />a chemical reaction!
5998533 6003033 Waltch! It can't even light up<br />a tiny light-bulb!
6003955 6006540 Do you dare deny this, Mr. Karpov?
6006625 6010879 Absolutely not. I proudly admit it!
6011671 6016171 But enough puny failure!<br />Failure is in the past!
6016968 6019887 Begging is behind us!
6020263 6023766 The balance of power<br />is about to shift!
6057259 6059010 Miracle one.
6063932 6068311 Karpov! Karpov! Karpov!
6091751 6094920 -Ilya!<br />-Go! Go, go, go!
6097632 6101802 I order all troops<br />loyal to Mother Russia
6101886 6105264 to seize the criminal Tretiak!
6110937 6112647 A thousand apologies,<br />Mr. President.
6112731 6115984 There was a miscommunication<br />somewhere in the chain of command.
6122407 6123491 Miracle two.
6124326 6128826 The billionaire industrialist and his<br />son llya were taken to Lubyanka prison
6129664 6134164 where they await trial along with<br />fellow conspirator General Sklarov.
6134419 6137755 Moscow woke today<br />to the forgotten sensation of warmth,
6137922 6139840 as millions of gallons of heating oil
6139924 6144011 flowed from a storage depot discovered<br />beneath Tretiak's riverside mansion.
6144179 6148391 -He made no threat to contact you?<br />-He never had the chance.
6148558 6151143 -You'll tell us if he does?<br />-Yes.
6151227 6155356 Which he may well do.<br />He's a proper rogue, you see.
6155940 6159443 He charms women,<br />this so-called saint.
6159611 6162405 It seems it's his stock-in-trade.<br />No offense.
6162572 6167072 I am offended. All I got from this<br />saint was near-death experiences.
6168912 6170580 Count yourself lucky.
6170747 6174083 I have an important conference<br />to prepare for.
6174250 6176252 We understand. You have a life.
6177295 6180298 -We appreciate you taking the time.<br />-No problem.
6187013 6188764 She's in love with him.
6259002 6261295 I wanted to call<br />and tell you everything.
6261880 6265592 - It just hasn't been safe.<br />- I couldn't stop thinking about you.
6267927 6272427 So, have you... been busy?
6273016 6277228 Yeah, I've been working real hard.<br />Thank God I have my cards back.
6278271 6281524 You don't believe in that<br />cold fusion mumbo-jumbo, do you?
6282233 6284360 You're a very pretty lady.
6284736 6288322 Oh, my God! That was you?
6289449 6291784 That's who I thought<br />Dr. Russell would like.
6292911 6295371 I thought you were an old biddy,
6295455 6298124 not a gorgeous<br />soon-to-be trillionaire.
6298583 6301627 You know you're gonna be<br />the richest woman in the world?
6302045 6305214 -I am?<br />-Why do you think I'm hanging around?
6312680 6313681 -Emma?<br />-Yeah?
6313848 6315724 My life is very strange.
6316392 6317768 I just...
6321856 6325025 I don't do anything normal.<br />I... I can't...
6325109 6326944 I know.
6327612 6329322 I Know you.
6330156 6331866 I know your life.
6332617 6335536 -What do you want?<br />-I want you.
6335870 6339248 -For how long?<br />-It doesn't matter.
6346381 6347882 Tell me you love me.
6350301 6351635 I love you.
6352720 6354221 Simon...
6355181 6357349 I love you, Simon.
6358810 6360353 Miracle three.
6384252 6388752 Dear Simon, the pin is something<br />I've kept for years, God knows why.
6390174 6392843 A graduation gift<br />from Catholic school.
6393011 6395346 But don't worry,<br />you don't have to wear it.
6395680 6399850 I just wanted you to have<br />something I loved.
6400351 6403270 Simon, I've seen it requires<br />three miracles,
6403354 6405898 then I'd say, you've made it, my love.
6406274 6408484 And so I hope you'll understand.
6408610 6412363 Last night, it became clear to me<br />what I have to do this morning.
6412447 6415575 You see, I'm going to<br />give cold fusion to the world.
6415742 6418453 It's the only way,<br />if we're ever together again,
6418620 6421706 that I'll know it's for you<br />and you'll know it's for me.
6422373 6426835 If cold fusion is free, then you<br />and I, Simon, will be free too.
6427462 6430548 Listen. If you think giving away<br />everything in front of the world,
6430632 6434677 preventing us from making a fortune,<br />will accomplish anything,
6436095 6437763 you're absolutely right.
6439682 6441642 Simon, what are you doing here?
6442852 6447314 -There are police everywhere.<br />-I wouldn't miss it for the world.
6448399 6451026 -You wore the pin.<br />-Of course.
6455448 6456907 You'd better go.
6470046 6472089 How am I gonna find you?
6473633 6476135 I'll find you. You found me.
6503538 6507083 Although our next speaker<br />requires no introduction
6507583 6510586 after last week's<br />Moscow fireworks,
6512130 6515675 please let me welcome<br />Dr. E.J. Russell...
6515842 6518427 Excuse me, is this seat taken?
6520179 6521638 No.
6523016 6524559 Dr. Russell.
6533735 6537363 You don't believe in this<br />cold fusion mumbo-jumbo, do you?
6538072 6539073 No.
6539699 6544199 Well, we all know that cold fusion<br />has had a difficult childhood.
6546998 6551252 Those of us in the field are orphans,<br />bastards at best.
6551836 6555881 But difficult childhoods, I believe,<br />make the most interesting adults.
6558468 6561387 I know that most of you thought...
6561554 6564974 I'm her biggest fan.<br />I think she's a fox.
6566726 6571226 Some may feel that its practical<br />application is still speculative.
6573066 6577566 But I want to share with you how<br />that dream is slowly becoming reality.
6581616 6583868 Look at the time. Got to go.
6586788 6590166 With your help, we can all<br />work towards making the...
6592043 6596338 dream of cold fusion<br />finally come true.
6628830 6630873 Got you, you slippery son of a...
6630957 6632416 What's going on here?
6638840 6640091 Damn!
6646722 6649683 Donations totaling three billion<br />dollars were made today to
6649767 6654267 the Red Cross, The Salvation Army, and<br />the United Nations' Children's Fund.
6654480 6658942 The funds were wired from the account<br />of jailed Russian tycoon Ivan Tretiak.
6659110 6663155 In other philanthropic news,<br />a non-profit research foundation
6663322 6667326 has been established<br />to develop cold fusion technology,
6667577 6669662 funded with an anonymous donation
6669871 6673291 and to be headed by Russian physicist,<br />Dr. Lev Botvin.
6673749 6676168 The E.J. Russell Foundation...
