45740 50140 Simon Magus was a magician<br />and a sorcerer...
50180 53100 in... um...
53140 55020 In Sumeria.
56060 59140 What happened<br />to Simon Magus, Bartolo?
59180 62140 Jesus' disciples<br />performed miracles.
62180 65080 When Simon Magus<br />saw the miracles...
65115 67980 he offered Peter gold<br />for God's powers.
68020 69860 How did Peter respond...
71140 72340 John Rossi?
74660 75820 Stand up!
81780 83260 Answer, John Rossi.
85180 86620 That's not my name.
87660 90140 You and all<br />the other bastards...
90180 91740 lucky enough to be here...
91780 95180 children of sin,<br />spawn of the damned...
95220 98780 are all named for saints...
98820 103180 saints who are disciplined,<br />saints who are chaste.
104140 107420 You are named<br />for John Baptist Rossi...
107460 110460 a Capuchin priest who<br />gave away all his possessions.
113020 116180 A man who had nothing,<br />like you.
116220 117700 Now what is your name...
118820 120860 you ungrateful cur?
133100 134780 Your name, boy!
137420 139500 Have you lost your tongue?
139540 141340 What is your name?
148460 150460 All the girls...
150500 154060 will remain locked<br />in their dormitory...
154100 157300 and no food<br />will be served to any boy...
157340 161860 until you acknowledge<br />your namesake before God.
184180 187060 Food! Food! Food!<br />Food! Food! Food! Food!
227140 229140 Yes. Yes.
232340 236580 They should name you<br />Simon Magus, the magician.
236620 237985 No.
238020 240380 Simon... Templar.
250980 252540 Agnes!
254220 255620 Agnes!
261700 262980 Agnes!
272900 273980 Agnes!
281780 283860 When they catch you,<br />they'll cane you.
283900 286180 Won't happen,<br />'cause we're leaving tonight...
286220 288780 this hearty brotherhood,<br />on a crusade.
288820 291100 That's why I risked everything,<br />Agnes, my love...
291140 292780 to bid you farewell.
292820 295220 I can't leave you behind<br />without a kiss.
295260 297340 Hey, watch this.
313780 315020 We've lost some girls!
315060 317460 The girls are missing!
317500 319500 There are girls missing!
319540 320700 Come on, boys!
329180 331620 Wait, John Rossi.<br />My kiss.
337820 339420 There he is! Get him!
342820 345500 Aah!
358260 359380 October 3.
359420 361620 Entering foyer<br />of Tretiak industries.
361660 366100 Heavy security on elevators.<br />Guards in uniform.
366140 369540 Elevator to vault on 26th floor<br />requires separate passkey.
370700 371900 Maybe use stairs.
372700 374020 No traffic there.
375540 376900 October 4.
377700 379425 Personal tidbits.
379460 382940 Tretiak's former partner<br />died suddenly in 1995.
382980 385940 It left Tretiak as sole owner<br />of a gas and oil empire.
388020 391180 Tretiak's first son killed<br />in car crash five years ago.
392820 394020 Who are you?
394060 396420 Vehicle was<br />driven by younger son Ilya...
396455 397660 now 27.
397700 399340 Wife now lives in Geneva...
399380 401180 following assassination<br />attempt in 1996.
401220 403240 I am... Ivanovanovitch.
403275 405260 October 5.
405300 408340 Ilya spent most of today<br />in Cafe Eldorado...
408380 409460 with bandito buddies.
409500 412540 Gangster rap, coffee,<br />flirting with teenage girls.
412580 415900 Small firearms in coats.<br />Machine pistols in cars.
491940 494580 There were<br />three great empires...
494620 499340 that dominated the world both<br />culturally and militarily...
500300 504660 Rome, Constantinople,<br />and Russia.
504700 506540 All three have fallen.
507340 509940 Only one can be restored...
509980 513780 and only one man<br />can restore it...
513820 516580 Ivan Petrovich Tretiak!
539380 542300 Friends...<br />countrymen...
542900 544060 Russians!
550700 554660 You people<br />here in this room...
555700 557860 are the cream of Russia...
558620 563260 and the whole nation<br />is listening with us.
563300 566700 But why do you all<br />listen to me rave?
566740 568700 Set aside my oil company...
568740 571300 forget about<br />my best-selling book...
571340 575780 and all I am is a lunatic...
575820 579460 haunted by the fantasy<br />of an empire...
579500 583700 that reclaims her former might,<br />her former size.
587660 593660 All I am is a poet<br />spinning rhymes of a Russia...
593700 598540 not cut off at the knees,<br />but armed to the teeth.
598580 604420 Not ridiculed, but revered.
606820 609220 No! More than revered!
609260 610660 Feared!
620100 624100 But who am I<br />to dazzle you with this dream?
624140 625340 All I've done is...
625380 628260 How does it look<br />for the leader's son...
628300 630780 to walk out<br />when the leader speaks?
630820 632220 You'd prefer<br />the leader's son...
632260 635580 to piss his pants on live TV?<br />Hmm?
637180 640420 And still the people<br />freeze to death!
658180 659580 I love this country.
788260 790820 I don't speak Russian.
790860 793420 In that case, stand up...
793460 795300 put your hands<br />behind your head...
795860 798020 and turn around slowly.
802500 805820 Wrong place for a condom.<br />Take it off.
812020 814500 Listen,<br />if I give this to you...
814535 816980 you'll give it to your daddy.
817700 820500 What's he gonna give you?<br />Not even a Christmas bonus.
820540 823980 The guy I'm stealing this for<br />will give me $1 million.
824020 825940 If we go in partners,<br />we'll split 50-50.
825980 828340 Half a million hard currency.
828380 830940 Think of the drugs you could buy<br />with that much cake.
830980 834260 You'll be discoing<br />for a decade in Moscow, mate.
834300 836500 I don't need your small change.
836540 838060 That's your first problem.
838940 840500 Here is your second.
841460 843740 Microchip... please.
845740 847220 Freeze!
847260 849300 Sorry. Guns make me nervous.
850180 852660 Suck me... sideways.
883860 886500 Aah! Uhh!
886540 889340 Uh! My eyes! Ohh!
907980 909460 Give it up!
915580 917540 You got no place to go!
931620 932700 A goddamn button!
941460 943740 Back of the building!<br />Come on!
955980 957220 Where's the body?
957260 959500 No body.<br />Just some guy in rags.
1022300 1024220 As the bitter chill of winter...
1024260 1025940 descends on Moscow...
1025980 1028260 Russians are warming<br />to the angry rhetoric...
1028300 1030740 of former communist boss<br />Ivan Tretiak.
1030780 1033300 Now a billionaire oil magnate...
1033340 1035260 and leader<br />of his own political party...
1035300 1038140 Tretiak predicted that the civil<br />unrest engulfing Russia...
1038180 1042300 will only worsen, unless<br />Reformist President Karpov...
1042335 1044060 can overcome<br />the heating-oil shortage...
1044100 1057820 that has already killed<br />scores of Russians.
1057860 1059260 What beautiful work.
1067380 1069480 Ah. Cloisonne.
1069515 1071580 It is old.
1071620 1073700 Yes.<br />It belonged to my grandmother.
1077500 1078660 Please.
1083780 1087180 Tonight I feel like<br />the oldest person on this plane.
1088540 1092020 My husband, he's sending me<br />to England to live...
1092060 1093945 until things change.
1093980 1097660 You are married<br />not even a year...
1097700 1100020 and already this bastard<br />has a girlfriend?!
1101020 1102265 I am sorry.
1102300 1103740 It's not my business.
1106460 1109380 How come you know<br />so much about me?
1110380 1111620 It is a gift.
1113660 1117540 I'm Martin de Porres.<br />I am from Spain...
1117580 1119420 but I'm named<br />for a Peruvian saint...
1119460 1122460 who could cure<br />the sick or the injured...
1122500 1124020 by the laying of hands.
1135740 1137945 Hmm.<br />He's the same build...
1137980 1140300 as the description<br />the Russians gave us...
1140340 1141900 but he doesn't<br />sound like an Aussie.
1141940 1143060 No.
1146420 1148260 Could be faking it.
1155580 1156700 X- rays are clear.
1156740 1159220 He hasn't swallowed<br />the microchip. Anything?
1159260 1161940 You English with<br />your chips, your fish and chips.
1161980 1163340 On the airplane, I had chicken.
1163380 1165460 Van Gogh theft,<br />Netherlands.
1165500 1167500 Last year. Same eyes.
1167540 1169220 Different chin.
1211020 1212500 Halcyon Hotel, guv.
1220900 1222745 Stand up!
1222780 1224940 What is your name?!
1224980 1226420 Answer the question!
1228780 1230900 What is your name?! Hey!
1236580 1238500 Lou, the microchip arrived.
1238540 1239660 I put the dough in your account.
1239700 1241900 Sorry I didn't get back<br />to you about that diamond.
1241940 1243500 Moscow's like Dodge City now.
1243540 1246060 All them greedy Commies have<br />turned into crazy capitalists.
1246100 1248340 It's disgusting.<br />It's made 'em sloppy.
1248380 1250580 One or two more easy scores<br />like this last one...
1250620 1252780 - I top 50 mil, I'm quitting.<br />- I heard that before.
1252820 1255180 Not from me.<br />I don't know nuttin'.
1255220 1256620 You don't believe me?<br />Try and find me.
1256660 1258020 - Fuck you, Lou.<br />- See yourself.
1263860 1265660 Can't seem to break 50.
1314620 1316900 "One million U.S. dollars...
1316940 1318420 "nonrefundable...
1318460 1320225 "reserves you a quiet table...
1320260 1325460 "at a romantic little spot<br />in Berlin called Templehopf...
1325500 1328340 "which has<br />a cozy transit lounge.
1328380 1330820 "To get inside, you walk<br />through the metal detectors...
1330860 1333100 "and I walk through<br />the metal detectors.
1333140 1337060 "Since you know I'm not armed,<br />and I know you're not armed...
1337100 1339900 "we can both fall in love,<br />and nobody gets hurt. "
1352740 1354340 I can't see him.
1354380 1356780 Then look for him.
1356820 1359820 You have<br />a long and beautiful cane...
1359860 1362060 along with your beautiful eyes.
1364540 1367100 That photograph<br />doesn't do you justice.
1367140 1368545 Who are you?
1368580 1370260 My name<br />is Bruno Hautenfaust.
1370300 1373460 I was named for a saint<br />who was a very wealthy man.
1373500 1375540 Had the wine, women, songs...
1375580 1379180 then took a vow of poverty<br />and became a hermit...
1379220 1382140 went to live in the forest...<br />in the nude.
1382180 1383580 Please leave.
1385180 1387940 I represent<br />the professional you hired.
1387980 1389860 I'm his business manager.
1389900 1391740 I speak for him.
1391780 1393820 We don't deal<br />with underlings.
1393860 1395580 Come on, Father. Let's go.
1396580 1399900 Wait. Sit down.<br />Listen and learn.
1399940 1401380 Ah. Youth.
1405700 1407740 Who runs this thief?
1407780 1410780 CIA? Ml-6? Libya?
1410820 1412580 He's not a racecar.<br />Nobody runs him.
1412615 1413900 He's an independent contractor.
1413940 1417540 Good. Then no one<br />will mind if I kill him.
1417580 1419260 Oh, yes.
1419300 1423780 I can have a man killed<br />and stroll away like that...
1423820 1425340 even with metal detectors...
1425380 1427660 even in this transit lounge.
1429220 1432220 Oh, it's so early.
1432260 1434180 You guys wanna get coffee<br />or something?
1435620 1436860 Sure.
1440780 1442625 Be quiet.
1442660 1444940 What is it<br />you request of my employer?
1444980 1447340 Do you know<br />what cold fusion is?
1447380 1448780 Of course.
1448820 1450940 It's the theory...
1450980 1453500 of nuclear fusion<br />at room temperature...
1453540 1454620 free energy forever.
1454660 1455900 Yes.
1455940 1457020 Kaffee?
1457060 1458140 Klein, Bitte.
1459940 1462740 As far as science goes,<br />it ranks just above astrology.
1462775 1465540 Those who claim to<br />have achieved the experiment...
1465580 1467660 have never been able<br />to duplicate it.
1467700 1468940 Until now.
1470700 1474620 There is an electrochemist<br />working at Oxford.
1474660 1476940 We believe<br />that this good lady...
1476980 1479780 made a breakthrough<br />in cold fusion.
1479820 1483740 Your employer<br />will obtain the formula for me.
1483780 1487420 He's very busy,<br />and you are very boring.
1487460 1489185 Your offer must inspire him.
1489220 1491740 This woman<br />has repeatedly avoided...
1491780 1495460 my agents' attempts<br />to find the formula.
1495500 1497500 She's cagey, difficult.
1498860 1501060 Maybe your agents are stupid.
1504980 1508900 I think this inspiration would<br />cost you three million dollars.
1508940 1511105 Ridiculous.
1511140 1515740 Why? You will have<br />the world market in energy.
1515780 1518140 Cost you a nickel<br />for every million you make.
1518180 1519420 His deposit should go-
1519460 1522500 Hey. It is not for me.
1522540 1523980 It is for mother Russia.
1524020 1527745 But you want mother Russia,<br />too, Mr. Tretiak.
1527780 1531420 Three million in a bank account<br />in Zurich. Agreed?
1533580 1535140 Yes.
1535180 1540260 How long to get<br />your employer's agreement?
1540300 1541460 I'll ask.
1556260 1557820 Your offer has inspired her.
1557860 1558940 I'll do it.
1560580 1562740 Bank account number in Zurich.
1563620 1565500 Auf wiedersehen. Bye, sonny.
1565540 1567260 Bye-bye.
1568700 1572820 I really love this guy.<br />Ha ha ha!
1575860 1577860 Too bad we have to kill him.
1577900 1579260 Yeah, too bad.
1593780 1596500 When the electrochemists<br />Pons and Fleischman...
1596540 1598940 announced in 1989...
1598980 1602060 that they had discovered<br />cold fusion...
1602100 1606220 a revolutionary process<br />of generating energy...
1606260 1609620 they were at first<br />acclaimed as geniuses...
1609660 1612380 and then condemned<br />as charlatans.
1613540 1616420 The protocols of cold fusion...
1616460 1617820 What are those? Drugs?
1617860 1620860 Could I have one?<br />My head's pounding.
1620900 1622940 She's boring the life<br />out of me.
1624700 1626700 - They're for my heart.<br />- Oh.
1627820 1630980 You have very pretty eyes.<br />You're a pretty lady.
1631020 1633345 - Who are you?<br />- Me?
1633380 1635820 I'm here to do an interview<br />with that Dr. Russell.
1635860 1638460 I'm gonna expose her as a fraud.
1638500 1641340 You don't put any stock in<br />this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?
1641380 1643420 - Actually, I do.<br />- Really?
1643460 1646540 Dr. Emma Russell.
1652660 1654580 Oops.
1658940 1664340 Well, I didn't prepare<br />any formal remarks.
1664380 1666260 I'm actually more interested...
1666300 1669660 in what questions you all have<br />about cold fusion...
1669700 1671740 so I thought we would<br />start with those.
1671780 1673780 Any questions?
1675980 1677060 Please?
1677100 1678540 I have, Dr. Russell.
1679540 1682620 Can you explain<br />the actual process of fusion...
1682660 1684220 you know, the theory?
1684260 1686980 Yes. Oh, there it is.
1687020 1690860 This is the-the apparatus.
1690900 1692220 And very simply...
1692260 1695380 when positively charged<br />deuterons...
1695420 1698260 are attracted<br />to the palladium cathode...
1698300 1699700 they cram together...
1699740 1703140 and there are millions of them<br />inside the cathode...
1703180 1706420 getting closer and closer,<br />and then they fuse...
1706460 1708540 and they create energy<br />in the form of helium.
1708580 1710100 But I read somewhere...
1710140 1711820 that the experiment<br />couldn't be replicated...
1711860 1715500 so how do we know it works?
1715540 1717620 We don't.
1717660 1718780 Not yet.
1719860 1721660 But if you remember Einstein...
1721700 1724700 he knew the theory<br />of relativity to be true...
1724740 1725900 long before he could prove it.
1725935 1727025 I mean, he felt the truth.
1727060 1731700 And, uh, some of us<br />feel the same way...
1731740 1732900 about cold fusion...
1732940 1735300 because it's there.<br />It's in nature...
1735340 1739900 the raw, natural power<br />just waiting to be harnessed.
1739940 1744180 When we ignite<br />that cold fusion fire...
1744220 1746420 I mean, just imagine.
1747500 1751380 There's more energy<br />in one cubic mile of seawater...
1751420 1754140 than in all the known<br />oil reserves on earth.
1754180 1758100 I mean, you could drive<br />your car 55 million miles...
1758140 1760500 on a gallon of heavy water.
1760540 1763300 It would be the end<br />of pollution...
1763340 1765780 warmth for the whole world.
1767260 1770980 So why don't I demonstrate<br />for you...
1771020 1774620 why other people in the past<br />have been so unsuccessful?
1776420 1777860 They used very complex...

1781900 1784420 Entering flat<br />of Dr. Emma Russell.
1784460 1785660 High Street, Oxford.
1786660 1789580 No alarms on outer doors.<br />Strange.
1789620 1791180 No messages.
1796380 1797620 Shelley Monument.
1800420 1801700 Entering bathroom.
1802420 1803860 Books.
1806220 1807420 More books.
1811140 1813740 Walls covered<br />with reminder notes.
1815780 1816860 Poetry.
1829740 1831900 Ah. Dad.
1863500 1865660 "Stop and talk to Shelley<br />every day.
1865700 1868180 "How can I love<br />a man named Percy?"
1871900 1873820 "Isn't there<br />someone in the world...
1873860 1875820 "who can consume me like that. "
1875860 1878980 Magic. Romantic.
1886820 1887860 No recent applications.
1887940 1889860 "Cold fusion notes. "
1900820 1902940 "Although I pass the<br />Shelley Monument every day...
1902975 1905220 "its sadness strikes me<br />every time. "
1906540 1909580 "I feel a very personal loss<br />when I look at it.
1909620 1911580 "So much pain<br />and so much passion. "
1916820 1919300 "To give light to them<br />that sit in darkness...
1919340 1920780 "and in the shadow of death. "
1922620 1925180 "Luke 1; verse 79."
1925220 1928100 Tretiak's wrong.<br />She's not cagey.
1929220 1932060 She's not difficult.<br />She's just...
1932100 1933340 eccentric.
1934020 1935980 She's innocent.
1942300 1943420 Maybe it's in her head.
1944900 1948580 She needs a poet...<br />an artist...
1950100 1951940 someone who...
1951980 1954660 understands truth.
1961900 1963660 She needs Thomas More.
2008700 2009980 Do you like it?
2012140 2013140 What?
2013180 2016260 The sculpture. Do you like it?
2017660 2021060 Oh... yes.
2021100 2022940 What do you love about it?
2032300 2037380 The way it... glows.
2038060 2041180 And how the light...
2041220 2043740 holds him in silence...
2044780 2046780 taking care of him.
2048420 2050900 That's what I like about it.
2054460 2055780 Are you an artist?
2055820 2061140 No. I'm just a traveler<br />searching for purity.
2062060 2064740 - What do you search for?<br />- Energy.
2064780 2066620 Yes.
2069180 2072020 Have you ever been<br />on a long journey?
2072060 2073780 No, not really.
2076500 2079060 Perhaps I'll take you<br />to my home...
2079100 2081220 in Africa.
2081260 2083740 You should<br />experience the energy...
2083780 2085500 of where all life began.
2091100 2094100 Sorry.<br />I'm not very good with people.
2098060 2099780 Me, neither.
2126940 2129860 "I see my angel<br />for the first time...
2129900 2132900 "know my purpose,<br />feel my birth... "
2134380 2137580 "hear, at first faintly,<br />then distinctly...
2137620 2139980 "the sweet strains<br />of our union... "
2141180 2144580 "Our love heats up<br />the cold universe...
2144620 2147340 "and gives my tired,<br />desperate hope... "
2147380 2150140 "purified<br />by our kisses...
2150180 2152860 "are eternally healed. "
2154460 2155705 Do you like it?
2155740 2157980 Who did you write it for?
2158020 2160420 You.
2160460 2163860 You're following me,<br />or it's destiny.
2163900 2166340 Either way, it's weird.
2166380 2167860 Very weird.
2170340 2171820 Destiny then.
2182260 2184020 This must look strange.
2185700 2186900 It's, uh...
2186940 2189900 something that I'm working on...
2189940 2191580 a formula for...
2192580 2194700 creating energy.
2195300 2197340 That you carry around<br />in your underwear?
2198980 2202180 Yeah, I do.
2214580 2216380 How did you do that?
2218300 2220380 Magic.
2220420 2222100 Give it back.
2222140 2223620 It looks like Sanskrit.
2223660 2225540 Give it back.
2227900 2230740 I'm sorry. I just wanted<br />to watch you put it away.
2232900 2235020 What else do you keep in there?
2235820 2236900 Nothing.
2236940 2238300 That's not true.
2239940 2242620 Can I get you<br />anything else?
2245060 2249100 Drink your wine.<br />Latour '57.
2250700 2254100 The Latour, sir,<br />is $400 a bottle.
2258180 2260300 Then we'll have two bottles.
2263460 2265180 There. You count it.
2271140 2274540 All these little tubes<br />and microbes and things.
2274580 2275900 Molecules?
2275940 2277980 Those, too.
2278020 2280580 Can I tell you something?
2280620 2282580 What? You must. Everything.
2282620 2285060 It's a secret.
2285100 2286220 What?
2288100 2289580 I'm done.
2292140 2295260 My energy research-<br />I'm finished.
2295300 2298580 I still have some sequencing<br />that I have to work out...
2298620 2301700 to make sure that it's safe,<br />but I did it.
2302900 2306340 It's just been you against<br />the whole world, hasn't it?
2306380 2308940 How have you done it<br />and stayed so positive?
2308980 2310620 The gift of faith.
2312380 2314580 To see...
2315940 2317260 Well...
2317300 2320780 to believe in something<br />that's all around us...
2321780 2324780 but hidden from our sight.
2325500 2327260 That's a beautiful thought.
2327300 2329300 I can't believe<br />I'm telling you this.
2330900 2333380 I don't even know your name.
2333420 2334900 Well, my name is...
2336540 2337980 I don't want to tell you.
2338020 2340060 I don't want to do that.
2341900 2344500 I don't want to do that.<br />What difference does it make?
2346780 2347900 What's your name?
2349140 2351340 - Emma.<br />- Emma.
2351380 2354020 Now I know<br />everything about you.
2355300 2357820 Your... genius.
2359780 2361500 You have a weak heart.
2365060 2368940 You have beautiful dreams,<br />great courage.
2370020 2372500 You're not afraid in this world.
2372540 2374420 You get that from your father.
2376660 2379100 You can't cook<br />to save your life...
2380260 2381540 and you love fish.
2383940 2385500 I do love fish.
2386540 2388700 That's weird.
2388740 2390300 I want to try that.
2390340 2391860 - No.<br />- Yes.
2391900 2393820 I don't want you to.<br />Drink your wine.
2396220 2397380 Yes, I do.
2398660 2399940 What's your name?
2401460 2403860 My name is Thomas More.
2403900 2407380 I was named after the saint...
2408860 2412100 who died for his faith.
2413900 2415020 OK.
2417460 2418620 Your work...
2420060 2423100 is very dangerous...<br />and alive...
2424740 2426420 and I love your poems.
2427180 2428540 They move me.
2430260 2432060 But that's not<br />who you really are.
2433980 2435380 You're running away from...
2436420 2439020 your past and your pain...
2439620 2443180 and yet you keep it<br />so close to you.
2445700 2449380 So you don't have to be afraid<br />of who you are...
2451460 2453300 because you're beautiful.
2509740 2511020 What are you doing?
2527980 2532820 Oh, my God,<br />you're bleeding. What happened?
2532860 2535020 Don't know. I was...
2535060 2538140 weeping, and I slipped.
2538180 2540500 I was thinking of you.<br />I don't know.
2540540 2542700 I live right down the street.
2542740 2544420 I could clean you up.
2545700 2547580 Why do you cover your mouth<br />when you laugh?
2547620 2548860 - I don't know.<br />- Wait.
2553220 2554740 I'm glad it stopped bleeding.
2556740 2558060 Don't need stitches.
2564740 2567460 We're gonna have<br />to disinfect it, though.
2567500 2569980 You really are an angel.
2570020 2571180 You are.
2574340 2576220 It's gonna hurt.
2576260 2577540 - Aah!<br />- Aah!
2577580 2579540 Oh, sorry.
2581660 2584500 I'm sorry. Are you all right?
2584540 2586380 Yeah.
2586420 2588260 I'm sorry. I was just joking.
2589700 2591260 I...
2591300 2593340 - I should go.<br />- Oh, no.
2593380 2595740 Yes. You-you... I...
2596740 2598740 Take off your pants.
2598780 2599900 Pardon?
2599940 2601460 I mean, your sweater.
2604900 2607780 There's blood on it.<br />I'll wash it.
2612580 2613900 Very domestic.
2615220 2618980 There's blood<br />on your blouse as well.
2621220 2622780 I'll wash it.
2636620 2638100 Do you have any wine?
2649380 2654940 I'm so overwhelmed<br />that you even noticed me.
2654980 2656420 How could I not?
2658980 2660620 You make me feel so good.
2660660 2661780 I wish you...
2663700 2665300 I wish you could understand.
2667140 2669860 I want you to know who I am.
2686220 2687420 Oh, my heart.
2688460 2690820 Don't disappear.<br />I'll be right back.
2690860 2693580 Calm it down.
2694300 2696140 Bring it round.
2696180 2700020 Too way high up, your street.
2701700 2704620 I can see...
2704660 2707140 like nothin' else...
2707180 2710580 in me, you're better<br />than I wanna be.
2712820 2717340 Don't think,<br />'cause I understand...
2717380 2719100 I care...
2719140 2721540 Don't think,<br />'cause I'm talking...
2721580 2724180 Oh, I can't do this.
2724220 2725420 She's so great.
2725460 2726820 I can't believe this.
2726860 2729300 I can't believe<br />this is happening.
2730060 2732905 I'm open...
2732940 2735820 to falling from grace.
2754940 2756140 Hi.
2772420 2774300 "To spider:
2774380 2776980 "Must fly. Have better offer. "
2777740 2780140 Greedy westerner.<br />Wants more money.
2780180 2781380 Who cares?
2781420 2784300 Can't spend hard currency<br />in hell.
2786340 2788020 Send this message-
2788060 2791260 "Fly, don't buzz off.
2792620 2794700 "I'll double your fee...
2796020 2800260 "or send my own boys<br />to take care of the woman. "
2807620 2809540 You OK?
2811340 2816060 Let's...<br />let's just lie here.
2818140 2820740 Can't we just<br />be like this tonight?
2822580 2824620 Is that what you want?
2825300 2827060 It's so magic.
2832860 2834620 It just feels so perfect.
2864300 2866860 It's 7:00 a. m.,<br />and here are the news headlines.
2875580 2876980 Thomas?
2950540 2953060 Lev Naumovitch,<br />it's here! Good man!
2953100 2954505 It's revolutionary, sir!
2954540 2957500 She's boldly cast aside<br />a slew of stale ideas...
2957540 2959980 but I think the formula<br />is incomplete.
2960020 2961100 It will take months...
2961140 2962340 That won't do...
2962380 2965260 because now that the people are<br />nicely beginning to freeze...
2965300 2968860 Tretiak must sweep in<br />with a miracle to save them.
2968900 2971140 How high do you want it,<br />Mr. Tretiak?
2971180 2973540 To the top.<br />Good morning, Yuri.
2973580 2974820 Good morning.
2974860 2977780 Perhaps I<br />can confirm the validity...
2977820 2980420 of this formula more quickly<br />if I dispense...
2980460 2983300 with certain protocols.<br />But, Mr. Tretiak-
2983340 2985420 How long, Dr. Botvin,<br />since you received...
2985460 2989140 your last salary check<br />from Moscow University?
2989180 2992020 Ukrainian Independence Day.
2993620 2994740 Last August.
2997220 2999420 Ivan, he's on-line.
3001420 3002500 Do it.
3005740 3006900 To spider...
3009180 3010740 You've got the recipe.
3010780 3011980 "Where's my dough?"
3012020 3014020 To human fly...
3015260 3018460 Recipe incomplete.
3018500 3020420 The cake won't rise.
3020460 3023340 Hence, no dough.
3029500 3031740 I am not the baker...
3031780 3034300 "... but don't make me<br />the butcher. "
3036500 3038220 I like this guy.
3042220 3045140 No play, no pay.
3045180 3048660 I'm certain you kept<br />the cookbook.
3056940 3058020 Holland Park.
3072980 3074660 I'll check that for you.
3074700 3077700 Yes, that seems to be fine.<br />One moment. Aah!
3086620 3088260 He's keeping me on-line.
3097700 3098940 You wait here.
3140500 3143140 You, beside the car.
3144220 3147900 Now, turn around.<br />Step away from the vehicle.
3147940 3149060 He's armed!
3171580 3172700 Drive!
3181940 3184300 Go the other way. Go!
3189020 3191220 You're all I've got tonight.
3192620 3195100 You're all I've got tonight.
3197260 3198540 What about him?
3206860 3208380 What about this one?
3212900 3215180 Yeah. That-
3215220 3218380 We believe<br />they're all the same villain.
3222980 3224380 Oh, my God.
3226340 3228460 They're all him?
3228500 3230140 We believe so.
3230180 3233020 He eluded a hit squad<br />this morning in Holland Park.
3235220 3237620 Then he fled the U.K.<br />out of Heathrow.
3237660 3239380 We've got a handful<br />of false identities...
3239420 3242780 used on visas,<br />passports, leases...
3243980 3245660 Nicholas Owen...
3245695 3247340 Louie Guanella...
3247380 3248540 Peter Damian...
3249940 3252100 Charles Borroneo.
3252140 3254580 Of course.
3254620 3257300 Thomas More.
3257340 3259340 All names of Catholic saints.
3262700 3265100 Can you access<br />Heathrow's passenger lists...
3265140 3268100 for the last eight hours?
3268700 3270300 I think it might be possible.
3270340 3271460 Good.
3279300 3280420 Go!
3298220 3299300 Yeah!
3310580 3311700 Yes!
3323020 3324460 See, my friends...
3325180 3328140 you back the biggest rats.
3348460 3349580 Hello.
3353460 3354940 Out, out.
3355020 3357345 Freeloaders, out.
3357380 3358980 I want to drink alone.
3359020 3360260 Close the curtain.
3381860 3383580 - What?<br />- What?
3385980 3387940 Don't look down.
3387980 3389820 You know who I am?
3390980 3392100 No.
3392140 3395740 I'm the thief<br />you tried to cheat.
3395780 3398620 This is your accountant.
3400860 3402300 Talk to him.
3404940 3407380 The phone goes<br />the other way, you moron.
3410900 3412460 Hello.
3412500 3414100 Tretiak speaking.
3414940 3419340 That money to Zurich,<br />send it now.
3419380 3420860 I said now.
3422300 3423540 Yeah.
3426060 3427180 Thank you.
3428180 3431900 You know what the hardest part<br />about being you is?
3431940 3434460 Pretending to be so bad in bed.
3436340 3438540 You son of the bitch.
3439260 3441620 There is an impostor.<br />Get him out.
3441660 3444140 Hey, hey, hey!
3444180 3447740 Take your hands off me,<br />you idiots!
3447780 3450060 Are you crazy? It's me.
3450100 3451220 Go, go!
3451260 3452545 Catch him, go!
3452580 3454460 Ilya, get the bastard!
3476380 3478660 Fifty million. I'm out.
3481140 3483060 Mr. Ferrer checking out.
3483100 3485620 OK.
3495100 3497500 I'll have one, too.
3498100 3499180 Emma.
3499220 3501060 Hi.
3502020 3504620 I'm... I'm overwhelmed.
3506380 3507460 You found me.
3507500 3509100 Wasn't very hard.
3510340 3513940 Two men with saint's names<br />flew into Moscow yesterday.
3513980 3517900 Isadore Bakanja<br />is a short, bald African...
3517940 3520340 whereas Vincent Ferrer-
3520380 3522420 Named after a saint<br />who betrayed his best friend.
3522460 3524340 How could you do it?
3524820 3526700 Emma...
3526740 3529340 I- I had to.
3530660 3531860 I'm a thief.
3531900 3533820 I want my cards back.
3533860 3535780 You flew all this way<br />for your cards?
3535820 3536900 Yes, I did.
3536940 3539500 No.<br />It's because you're in love.
3543140 3544380 I rest my case.
3544420 3546180 Who are you?
3546220 3549260 No one has a clue,<br />least of all me.
3549300 3552940 And why would you<br />steal cold fusion?
3552980 3556180 It's free.<br />Why would you do that?
3558260 3559900 Eight million reasons.
3559940 3562540 Eight million.<br />Wow. That's all?
3564220 3567580 I would have<br />given them to you...
3567620 3569420 if you'd only asked.
3575580 3576900 You've got<br />to get away from me.
3576940 3580260 I'm not going until you tell me<br />why you lied to me.
3580300 3582780 - You lied to me.<br />- I lied to you?
3582820 3585260 You almost got me killed.<br />The guy says it doesn't work.
3585300 3587020 Well, screw him.
3587060 3589260 I don't think you'd enjoy that.
3589300 3591180 You're right.<br />I don't think I would.
3598540 3601540 Emma, you don't know<br />what you're dealing with here.
3603140 3604540 What?
3612940 3614580 - They took my pills.<br />- No, they didn't.
3614620 3616620 I palmed them from your purse.
3616660 3618780 I need one or two.
3618820 3621860 I need...<br />I have a bad heart.
3621900 3623980 - I know.<br />- It's starting to pound.
3624015 3625597 It's OK. I've got your pills.
3625632 3628366 OK, I've got two in my hand.
3628401 3631100 I'm gonna pass out.
3631140 3632940 Sit down on the floor.
3634500 3637580 Just get down on the floor.<br />That's right.
3637620 3639380 That's right.<br />Eat two out of my hand.
3639420 3642820 That's right. OK?
3642860 3645220 While you're down there...
3647860 3649740 Get the pocketknife<br />out of my boot.
3652300 3655980 This formula makes<br />certain assumptions...
3656020 3660220 which contradict all we know<br />about cold fusion cathodes...
3660260 3662420 so testing at any level<br />becomes futile...
3662460 3666020 without further information,<br />Mr. Tretiak.
3666060 3668740 Don't despair, Dr. Botvin.
3668780 3670180 Help is here.
3681340 3683060 The two came very quietly.
3685340 3686500 Oh.
3691540 3694220 And they left even more quietly.
3695900 3697260 Close the city.
3697700 3702300 Kill him, and bring her... alive.
3715940 3718700 Why are they after me?
3718740 3722860 Tretiak, the guy I work for...<br />he owns this city, cops and all.
3722900 3727020 We have to convince him there's<br />nothing more he wants from you.
3727055 3729060 What do you want from me?
3734940 3738340 - Everything's on those cards?<br />- Yes.
3738380 3739820 So the formula works?
3739860 3742340 Oh, kiss me again.
3744620 3746025 - No.<br />- Make up your mind.
3746060 3751100 Oh, it's-I have to<br />figure out the order...
3751140 3753820 before the formula works,<br />and I'm not giving it to him.
3753860 3755860 - Tretiak will find you.<br />- No.
3755900 3758300 He found me,<br />and that's hard to do.
3758340 3762300 - I found you.<br />- Yes, you did.
3762340 3763620 What do you need?
3768020 3769900 I need some time...
3769940 3771180 and I need...
3773420 3776260 I need a place to work...
3776300 3777860 and...
3778860 3781020 Where's everyone going?
3781060 3784300 To their country<br />relatives to cut firewood.
3784340 3785980 There's no heat in the city.
3795780 3797820 How long will it take you<br />to finish the formula?
3797860 3799420 I don't know.
3799460 3802540 Two hours, maybe.<br />I don't know.
3802580 3805140 Should be enough time to get<br />our passports together...
3805180 3808020 and for us to get married.
3808060 3810660 - We're getting married?<br />- Yes.
3811780 3814940 I want you to be<br />Mrs. Martin de Porres.
3818620 3821020 - You're not Martin.<br />- No.
3822460 3823620 Who are you?
3826980 3828380 I don't have a name.
3829940 3831140 That's sad.
3831180 3833460 Will you have a name<br />when we get home?
3833500 3835340 I don't have a home.
3835380 3837060 When we get back...
3837100 3839300 you do the science,<br />I'll do the math.
3839340 3841020 We'll market your formula<br />around the world.
3841580 3844180 We'll make a fortune,<br />and then...
3845820 3846980 we'll see.
3848340 3849980 OK?
3858220 3859500 Emma!
3876780 3878340 No trouble, OK?
3881740 3884940 If you want to live,<br />never leave my side.
3931100 3932260 Ohh!
4000820 4002140 Spice room, sun room...
4002180 4004220 Shadow room, night...
4005620 4007340 I've got you.
4013580 4015100 Come on.
4019260 4021100 Here we go. Up.
4024460 4027020 We've gotta get you warm.
4034700 4036460 We're almost there.
4059580 4060740 Come on.
4062060 4063940 Come on.
4069100 4072140 You'll wait till Christ<br />comes to Moscow.
4072180 4074780 Elevator was made of mahogany.
4074820 4076900 Tenants used it<br />for firewood last winter.
4076940 4078460 We need your help.
4078500 4081180 He fell in the river,<br />and he's freezing.
4081220 4082860 - Need clothes.<br />- We're just people-
4082900 4087180 You're not people.<br />You're Americans.
4087220 4090340 Yes, but we ran into trouble<br />with your Mafia.
4121180 4125580 She disapproves of what I do,<br />but eats the bread it buys her.
4127500 4129620 No heat for sale...
4129660 4131500 but these clothes<br />will make him warm.
4136740 4139260 I tell her, Mashenka,<br />go back to bed.
4139300 4141300 She's always puttering around.
4144940 4148780 It's here.<br />Built to escape Secret Police.
4148820 4150260 In you go.
4164340 4166660 You've got hypothermia.
4166700 4169100 We have to get<br />these wet clothes off...
4170460 4171540 keep you warm.
4172380 4174540 They must be in<br />one of these buildings.
4174580 4176180 Check every apartment.
4178060 4181100 How you doing? Talk to me.
4181140 4183860 Snug as a bug in a rug.
4191580 4194900 OK. We're gonna...
4194940 4198820 We're gonna have to do this<br />before your body temperature...
4198860 4201700 falls below 95 degrees.
4213980 4216820 Two kids<br />talking about foreigners.
4225380 4227020 Listen to me, tenants!
4227860 4230020 Show me where<br />the Americans are...
4230060 4233900 and you'll be paid<br />in American dollars.
4233940 4236220 Five hundred bucks reward.
4236255 4237420 Daddy...
4238940 4242020 have you seen, by chance,<br />two Americans?
4242060 4244740 Just one American<br />and one polar bear.
4246580 4248380 Do we get 250?
4267340 4268460 We check upstairs.
4280380 4281820 What's your name?
4285100 4286500 Who are you really?
4288460 4289580 Simon.
4289620 4290820 Simon?
4291740 4294700 So you are named for a saint.
4294740 4296500 No, Simon the magician.
4297380 4299420 I did tricks...
4299460 4302900 tricks for Agnes...<br />and that's how I got things.
4302940 4306780 Priests took everything,<br />took Agnes.
4306820 4308820 Dogs too big.
4308860 4311820 Teeth. Teeth.
4311860 4313580 She fell.
4313620 4314940 I escaped.
4316340 4317460 I always escape.
4318780 4321180 I don't believe in magic<br />anymore.
4322780 4324060 I do.
4326620 4329220 I've never felt<br />like this before.
4330380 4331500 How?
4332860 4334340 I'm freezing.
4338780 4340460 These are here!
4347300 4350100 We gotta get out of here.<br />Are you OK?
4350140 4352220 They're coming.
4353180 4355780 Americans are here!
4355820 4358140 Hurry. Here, put this on.
4363740 4364860 Ilya!
4377940 4379180 Upstairs. Go!
4396500 4398020 Maybe we can jump.
4399100 4400580 Let's jump.
4404540 4406300 Come on.
4430940 4432100 Wait.
4448700 4450180 We need her alive, idiot.
4452660 4454300 Embassy's east of here.
4472860 4474660 You're late.<br />Where have you been?
4475420 4477060 I've been waiting two hours.
4477100 4480620 I've got some beautiful<br />paintings for you to buy.
4480660 4482140 In here. Come on.
4486940 4490100 Don't fret.<br />It's just my curator, Toli.
4490140 4492740 I am Alexa Frankievitch,<br />but being you're Americans...
4492780 4494580 you can call me Frankie.
4494620 4496620 OK, Frankie.<br />I've got money. We want-
4496660 4500500 I know. The icon<br />of the Virgin of the Damned.
4500540 4502900 - Are those maps of the tunnels?<br />- Yes.
4502940 4505620 We're not here to buy art.<br />Take us to the American Embassy.
4505660 4508620 Right.<br />I need $10,000 up-front.
4508660 4510905 No.
4510940 4514340 OK. 7,000 and not a penny less.
4514380 4515780 Shh.
4523060 4524500 Police.
4524540 4526500 No. Tretiak's goons.
4535260 4536420 Wait.
4536460 4539340 Sasha,<br />go east to the embassy.
4539380 4541300 - Are we lost?<br />- What's wrong?
4541340 4544540 You're in Russia, sir.<br />Everything is complicated.
4544575 4545620 But you know the way?
4545740 4549180 Like the face<br />of a Bulgari chronograph.
4559060 4560900 I remember. This way.
4565100 4567740 At last. Water main.
4568500 4570700 They shut it down<br />each afternoon in winter.
4570740 4572300 What time do they<br />turn it back on?
4572340 4575620 You have five minutes,<br />plus or minus.
4575660 4576740 Plus or minus?
4576780 4579105 That means several<br />minutes earlier or later.
4579140 4582180 Don't worry.<br />Third opening is your embassy.
4599620 4601460 Quick. Someone's coming.
4607020 4609500 Come on. Come on.
4616980 4618940 Here's the second one.
4618980 4620700 Embassy's next.
4624260 4627780 - About two more minutes.<br />- Yeah. Unless it's minus.
4631460 4634060 Damn.<br />It's sealed.
4635540 4637260 We'll have to go back.
4637300 4638460 Come on.
4661460 4662660 Hurry.
4672340 4674300 Up you go.
4693060 4695980 Yankee, go home!<br />Down with Yankee!
4703500 4706660 Embassy's only<br />about 100 yards away.
4706700 4710140 There's a car right above us.<br />Watch your head.
4742140 4744060 I'll create a diversion.
4744100 4746780 It should take you 10 seconds<br />to run to those gates.
4746820 4748700 They'll open them<br />when they see you coming.
4749580 4751260 OK. I can do that.
4751300 4753340 You can do it.
4753380 4757220 Wait. When am I gonna see you?
4757260 4759180 I'll find you. You found me.
4759220 4760820 Yeah, I did.
4789900 4791020 Aah!
4821100 4824460 I'm an American!<br />Open the gate!
4824500 4826940 Open the gate!<br />I'm an American!
4827620 4829740 Back off from the gate.
4829780 4832620 Back off. I said back off.
4833700 4836980 Stand back from the gate.
4838620 4840060 I said back off!
4852540 4853980 She outran you?
4854020 4855980 How humiliating.
4859700 4862820 One... shot left.
4864420 4866380 Can't come<br />all the way to Russia...
4866420 4869100 and not play Russian roulette.
4869140 4871300 Before you shoot me,<br />want to know where the money is?
4872940 4874540 Whose money?
4874580 4876140 Tretiak's, yours.
4876180 4878540 He treats you like dirt.<br />You could have it all.
4878580 4880060 What are you saying?
4880100 4882220 I'm saying your father<br />stashed billions...
4882260 4885140 and I know where it's hidden.<br />Let's make a deal.
4885180 4888700 So... where are all those<br />hidden billions?
4889420 4893180 I know... but I don't think<br />I'm gonna tell you.
4921780 4924540 Joseph, what's the holdup?<br />I said get 'em inside!
4924580 4926460 You're worse<br />than all the others.
4926500 4929100 However, burns will heal.
4929140 4931700 Maybe a little chance<br />of scarring, perhaps...
4931740 4934980 but all in all,<br />I'd say he's a very lucky boy.
4935015 4937260 Lucky? Look at me.
4938140 4940700 I am a damn devil.
4940740 4942220 Christ.
4945380 4946460 Yes?
4946500 4949500 I have run every test<br />on this cold fusion formula...
4949540 4953900 and must conclude<br />it is not merely incomplete...
4953940 4956140 but rather... impossible.
4956180 4959820 You may as well try to create<br />perpetual motion.
4960740 4963460 I invest millions...
4964620 4967460 and you can't make it work!
4970740 4973540 What are you doing<br />with my money?
4976100 4979780 Do you think it comes so easy?
4979820 4980940 No!
4980980 4982940 But, sir...
4982980 4987460 I have been working for<br />nearly two weeks without sleep.
4987500 4991900 At first blush, the theorem<br />appears quite convincing.
4991940 4993420 It does?
4997700 5001820 Yes. It does.
5002540 5003820 Good man.
5003860 5006420 We can use it<br />to destroy our enemies.
5008140 5011500 Only Dr. Russell<br />can spoil my plan.
5011540 5014220 If she gets back to London<br />and speaks to the press...
5014260 5017940 From here to the airport<br />are three army checkpoints...
5017980 5019780 all of them loyal to us.
5019820 5021820 Make certain<br />they get the message-
5021860 5024620 she doesn't leave Moscow alive.
5027060 5028260 Mr. President.
5028300 5031300 As former Vice-minister<br />of Energy and Power...
5031340 5036420 I hear all manner of schemes<br />that provide cheaper energy.
5036460 5039900 And as our countrymen<br />freeze to death...
5039940 5043260 I've become aware of<br />a marvelous new technology...
5043300 5046140 about which I'm hopelessly<br />out of my league...
5046180 5048820 from a scientific viewpoint.
5048860 5051980 That's why I brought<br />our eminent physicist here...
5052020 5055140 Dr. Lev Botvin from<br />the University of Moscow.
5055180 5057660 Before we are dazzled<br />by the good news...
5057700 5060260 let's dispense with the bad.
5060300 5062420 What is the price<br />of this marvel?
5062460 5065180 The cost of research<br />and development are there...
5065220 5068780 which is all<br />you are asked to defray.
5073660 5076300 Ten billion in hard currency?
5076340 5081260 I can't even pay my teachers,<br />my miners, my doctors.
5088460 5090380 Where are you heading?
5090420 5093700 I thought we'd drink<br />some vodka to get warmer.
5097740 5100700 Like the miracle of socialism...
5100740 5103940 our miracle<br />of cold fusion failed.
5103980 5105100 But no matter.
5105140 5109260 We have sold cold fusion<br />to President Karpov.
5109300 5112700 We will use the scandal<br />of its failure to destroy him.
5112740 5115500 The army must be mobilized<br />by midnight tomorrow.
5115540 5119020 You're a man in a hurry.<br />That's only one day.
5119060 5122340 Not now, old witch.<br />We're working.
5122380 5123780 Yes. Think of it.
5123820 5129420 One day, you can be proud again<br />to be a Russian general...
5129460 5133420 with a big nuclear missile<br />where your prick used to be.
5133460 5136460 You must complete a form<br />before you get on a flight home.
5136500 5138060 Any medical problems?
5138100 5139540 I have a heart condition.
5139580 5142020 Do you need me to arrange<br />any medication for you?
5142900 5145340 Well, I haven't<br />needed a pill.
5145860 5147020 That's strange.
5147060 5149100 Get a form from<br />table three down the corridor.
5149140 5150580 I'll be back in 10 minutes...
5150620 5152740 by your side,<br />all the way to the airport.
5152780 5153900 Thank you.
5153940 5156100 ...Across the street<br />in central Moscow...
5156140 5160580 where a mob attacked several<br />companies with ties to America.
5160620 5164420 Apparently, four U.S. citizens<br />were injured in the attack.
5164500 5166260 I'm told<br />that all American citizens...
5166300 5168820 have been asked to report<br />to the American embassy...
5168860 5170700 for immediate evacuation.
5170740 5173900 Excuse me. You look lost.
5173940 5176305 - No, I'm fine.<br />- May I help you?
5176340 5180900 Allow me to introduce myself.<br />My name is August Christopher.
5180940 5184380 Named after Saint Augustine,<br />who coined my favorite phrase-
5184420 5186860 "Give me chastity<br />and give me constancy...
5186900 5189420 "but do not give it yet. "
5193380 5196780 Simon, I'm on the next flight<br />out of here.
5196820 5197980 Are you coming with me?
5198020 5201380 No. But they are.
5207300 5210780 I'll need you to develop<br />a sudden fear of flying.
5210820 5212620 Find a quiet room.
5213460 5215700 Finish the formula<br />and fax it back to me.
5215740 5217420 My number's on the back.
5217460 5221100 I don't understand.<br />Why are you keeping my cards?
5221140 5222900 I've got to deal<br />with the Russians...
5222940 5224940 or you'll never be safe.
5224980 5226660 Be good at school.
5226700 5227820 Wait.
5230180 5233100 - Don't you trust me, darlin'?<br />- Trust who?
5233940 5235620 That hurts, Emma.
5235660 5238220 I'm serious.<br />What's your name?
5238260 5240940 My name is August Christopher.
5240980 5243860 Of course I trust you,<br />August Christopher.
5243900 5245820 I mean, Vincent Ferrer...
5245860 5247980 I mean, Martin de Porres...
5249180 5250940 Thomas More.
5252060 5254900 After all,<br />you are my personal saint.
5255820 5257660 You have to be a very good...
5257700 5261100 and, usually, a very dead person<br />to become a saint.
5261140 5264620 And more importantly,<br />you have to work three miracles.
5264660 5266860 Now, get to work.
5267620 5269220 Who's that man?
5269260 5271540 You're leaving<br />on the transport at 9:00, ma'am?
5271580 5274460 Probably be your<br />last chance out of here.
5274500 5275940 Better hurry. It's leaving.
5278220 5280740 Your troops<br />will depose the president...
5280780 5283620 and install Ivan Tretiak<br />as leader of Russia.
5283660 5288220 Moscow must be<br />ringed with tanks by evening.
5288260 5291460 Don't worry.<br />The people will follow me.
5291500 5293660 They will be crying<br />for revolution.
5293700 5296180 Still, no one's<br />guessed the simple truth...
5296220 5298220 of where the heating oil went.
5302260 5304940 Who would believe<br />that a sea of oil...
5304980 5307540 was hidden under<br />this very building?
5309180 5312020 Yuri, I understand<br />your Nataly is to...
5312060 5314540 Francis, you devil...
5314580 5316820 I heard you came here,<br />and you didn't call me.
5316860 5320100 - Hello, Dominic-<br />- Give me a ring, Charles.
5320140 5322740 Lou,<br />I've heard on the grapevine...
5322780 5325980 you're brokering a revolutionary<br />new energy source.
5326820 5329020 If it's as good<br />as it's cracked up to be...
5329060 5332180 I have friends who can double<br />your best offer...
5332220 5334300 on deposit in Zurich...
5334340 5337100 within one hour<br />of delivery and confirmation.
5337900 5339020 I'll be waiting.
5359460 5361180 The work could be here.
5361220 5363060 This machine could work,<br />couldn't it?
5365740 5367340 Who are you?
5367380 5369420 A friend of Dr. Russell's.
5369460 5370620 Dr. Russell?
5372700 5374700 What's this equation?
5374740 5376060 It's so simple.
5377460 5379540 This is the key<br />to Dr. Russell's formula.
5379580 5380860 Yes.
5382620 5384780 The alarm. You had better go.
5384820 5388700 I need a miracle.<br />You've got 12 hours.
5390180 5392260 But Mr. Tretiak's rally<br />is tonight.
5392300 5393900 Can you make it work?
5395500 5396620 Make it work.
5400980 5402380 What is wrong here?
5402420 5403780 Uh, the alarm...
5406380 5408220 Uh... uh...
5408940 5410340 I tripped.
5418820 5422220 You are Nikolai Petrovich.
5422260 5423900 You are Nikolai Provovich-
5423940 5425100 Petrovich.
5435740 5437700 Tunnel built by KGB...
5439860 5442140 Leads to machine room<br />in Kremlin.
5442180 5446220 Do you know where<br />the president's quarters are?
5446260 5450060 President Karpov is there.
5450100 5454100 But there are many guards,<br />so I suggest-
5454140 5456060 An alternate route?
5456100 5458900 Money. Now.
5460780 5462300 Oh, ye of little faith.
5464900 5467500 Russia stands tonight...
5467540 5470260 on the brink<br />of a second revolution.
5470300 5472740 As the number of deaths<br />from freezing mounts...
5472780 5474660 hundreds of thousands<br />of protesters...
5474700 5476780 have taken to the streets.
5476820 5478380 Even as<br />Russian President Karpov...
5478420 5480580 is promising<br />a mysterious solution...
5480620 5482460 to the crippling<br />heating-oil shortage...
5482500 5484620 troops opposed<br />to the elected government...
5484660 5486865 and led<br />by General Leo Sklarov...
5486900 5489580 have begun to ring<br />the Russian capital city.
5489620 5491500 Angry, frightened citizens...
5491540 5494220 are gathering outside<br />the Kremlin in Red Square...
5494260 5496020 but they're not braving<br />the bitter cold...
5496055 5498060 for yet another political rally.
5498100 5501420 They've been drawn here by<br />the promise of a revelation...
5501460 5502820 whatever that may be...
5502860 5505260 in what's become<br />a life-and-death struggle...
5505300 5508180 for the future<br />of democracy in Russia.
5580500 5583220 Mr. President?<br />I'm your friend.
5583255 5584980 What do you want?
5586780 5589940 I want to help you<br />to destroy Tretiak.
5589980 5591700 I need you to listen<br />for about 30 seconds.
5593460 5596140 I'm all right. Stay outside.
5596180 5598100 Please, continue.
5598140 5601420 Tonight you'll stand trial<br />in Red Square before the world.
5601455 5604700 Whatever Tretiak accuses you of,<br />I need you to admit to it.
5604740 5606220 Agree with this criminal?
5606260 5609020 If you want<br />to destroy Tretiak... yes.
5625500 5627620 Gruschev,<br />take Mr. Karpov downstairs.
5627660 5628820 The wife stays here.
5630940 5634220 Get your hands off!<br />What you are doing is illegal!
5634260 5636140 The people won't stand for it!
5636180 5639500 The people are too cold<br />to stop it. Who are you?
5653180 5655860 Tretiak!<br />Tretiak! Tretiak!
5670620 5672660 Friends...
5672700 5674540 countrymen...
5674580 5676660 Russians!
5685940 5690100 You heard about this morning's<br />sensational events.
5690140 5693140 Many shocking documents<br />were recovered...
5693180 5695340 from the president's<br />secret files...
5695380 5697905 locked within his private safe.
5697940 5702700 The documents which will be<br />published in today's papers...
5702740 5706865 prove that the traitor Karpov...
5706900 5710620 was about to steal<br />over 40 trillion...
5710660 5713420 of our precious<br />Russian rubles...
5713460 5717940 in a reckless scheme<br />to save his hide!
5717975 5719860 To add insult...
5719900 5722740 millions of dollars<br />were to be paid...
5722775 5725740 to this international criminal!
5732420 5734380 And for what<br />was your president...
5734420 5738385 hoping to bankrupt<br />our national treasury?
5738420 5743360 What you see is a fairy tale<br />called cold fusion.
5743395 5748300 You pass electric current<br />into the machine...
5748340 5752420 and there is supposed<br />to be a chemical reaction.
5752460 5753980 Watch.
5754020 5757500 It can't even light up<br />a tiny light bulb!
5757540 5759900 Do you dare deny this,<br />Mr. Karpov?
5759940 5762060 Absolutely not!
5762100 5764305 I proudly admit it!
5764340 5767340 But enough puny failure.
5767380 5769420 Failure's in the past!
5769460 5772580 Begging is behind us!
5772620 5776220 The balance of power<br />is about to shift!
5808780 5810740 Miracle one.
5814940 5834780 Karpov! Karpov!
5841780 5842860 Ilya! Ilya!
5842900 5844220 Go! Go!
5844260 5845740 Go, go, go!
5847220 5851500 I order all troops<br />loyal to mother Russia...
5851540 5854860 to seize the criminal Tretiak!
5860180 5861740 A thousand apologies,<br />Mr. President.
5861780 5865020 There was a miscommunication<br />in the chain of command.
5871220 5872580 Miracle two.
5872660 5875740 The billionaire<br />industrialist and his son...
5875780 5878220 were taken to the infamous<br />Lubyanka prison...
5878260 5882160 where they await trial<br />along with General Leo Sklarov.
5882195 5886060 Moscow woke today to the<br />forgotten sensation of warmth...
5886100 5888260 as millions of gallons<br />of heating oil...
5888300 5891360 flowed from a storage depot<br />beneath Tretiak's mansion.
5891395 5894420 He made no threat<br />to contact you in the future?
5894460 5896220 He never had the chance.
5896260 5897500 You'll tell us<br />if he makes contact?
5897540 5898660 Yes.
5898700 5903260 Which he may well do.<br />He's a proper rogue.
5903300 5906740 He charms women,<br />this so-called Saint.
5906780 5909580 It seems it's his stock<br />in trade. No offense.
5909620 5913300 Well, I am offended.<br />All I got from this Saint...
5913340 5915420 was a series<br />of near-death experiences.
5915460 5916665 Count yourself lucky.
5916700 5920980 I have a very important<br />conference I must prepare for.
5921020 5923260 We understand.<br />You have a life.
5923300 5924940 We appreciate<br />your taking the time.
5924980 5926420 No problem.
5932660 5934580 She's in love with him.
6002140 6004860 I wanted to call you<br />and tell you everything.
6004900 6006060 It hasn't been safe.
6006100 6008620 I couldn't stop<br />thinking about you.
6010780 6015620 So... have you been busy?
6015660 6018100 Yeah.<br />I've been working real hard.
6018135 6020505 Thank God I have my cards back.
6020540 6024020 You don't believe in<br />this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?
6024060 6026620 You know,<br />you're a very pretty lady.
6026660 6028860 Oh, my God.
6028900 6030300 That was you?
6031260 6033620 That's who I thought<br />Dr. Russell would like.
6034660 6037140 I thought you were<br />some old biddy...
6037180 6040420 not some gorgeous<br />soon-to-be-trillionaire.
6040460 6043260 You know you're going to be<br />the richest woman in the world.
6043300 6044380 I am?
6044420 6047220 Why do you think<br />I'm hanging around?
6053420 6054500 - Emma.<br />- Yeah?
6054540 6056220 My life is very strange.
6057140 6058420 I just...
6062220 6064300 I don't do anything normal.
6064340 6065820 I'm-I can't even-
6065860 6069180 I know. I know you.
6070340 6072660 I know your life.
6072700 6075220 - What do you want?<br />- I want you.
6075260 6077220 For how long?
6077260 6079180 It doesn't matter.
6085820 6087460 Tell me you love me.
6089300 6090900 I- I love you.
6091940 6093060 Simon.
6094460 6096580 I love you, Simon.
6097780 6099740 Miracle three.
6122300 6124220 Dear Simon...
6124260 6127500 the pin is something<br />I've kept for years.
6127540 6130820 A graduation gift<br />from Catholic school.
6130860 6133300 But don't worry.<br />You don't have to wear it.
6133340 6135700 I just wanted you<br />to have something of mine...
6135740 6137780 something I loved.
6137820 6140580 Simon, if sainthood<br />requires three miracles...
6140620 6143260 then I'd say you've made it,<br />my love...
6143300 6145380 and so I hope you'll understand.
6145420 6148860 Last night, it became clear<br />what I have to do this morning.
6148900 6152100 I'm going to give<br />cold fusion to the world.
6152140 6154900 It's the only way,<br />if we're ever together again...
6154940 6158620 that I'll know it's for you,<br />and you'll know it's for me.
6158655 6163580 If cold fusion is free,<br />then you and I will be free.
6163620 6166740 If you think giving away<br />everything before the world...
6166780 6169020 preventing us from making<br />an unimaginable fortune...
6169060 6172700 will accomplish anything...<br />you're absolutely right.
6175420 6177300 Simon, what are you doing here?
6177340 6179700 There are police.
6179740 6181140 They're everywhere.
6181180 6183420 I wouldn't miss it<br />for the world.
6183460 6186380 - You wore the pin.<br />- Of course.
6190180 6191300 You better go.
6204660 6205940 How will I find you?
6207900 6210620 I'll find you. You found me.
6236660 6239620 Although our next speaker<br />requires no introduction...
6239660 6244020 after last week's<br />Moscow fireworks...
6244060 6248300 please let me welcome<br />Dr. E.J. Russell.
6248340 6252060 Excuse me.<br />Is this seat taken?
6252100 6254980 No.
6255020 6256740 Dr. Russell?
6265420 6268220 You don't believe in all this<br />cold fusion mumbo jumbo, do you?
6268255 6269820 Thank you. Good morning.
6269860 6271300 No.
6271340 6275380 We all know cold fusion<br />has had a...
6275420 6278260 a difficult childhood.
6278300 6280820 Those of us in the field<br />are orphans...
6280860 6282740 bastards, at best.
6282780 6287700 But difficult childhoods make<br />the most interesting adults.
6289140 6291380 I know most of you thought<br />that cold fusion...
6291420 6293980 I'm her biggest fan.
6294020 6296705 I think she's a fox.<br />Look at that.
6296740 6299660 Even though<br />some of you may feel...
6299700 6303300 that its practical application<br />is still somewhat speculative...
6303340 6307420 I've come here today to share<br />how that dream is slowly...
6307460 6308540 becoming a reality.
6308580 6311940 Yes, it may take years<br />to finally learn...
6311980 6313860 Look at the time.<br />Got to go.
6313900 6317380 ...stabilize its power,<br />but with your help...
6317420 6320300 we can all work towards<br />making the-the...
6321420 6325700 dream of cold fusion<br />finally come true.
6348900 6349980 Quickly!
6350020 6351780 We got him!
6351815 6353660 Hyah!
6355300 6357020 Hands behind your back!
6357060 6359060 Got you, you slippery-
6359100 6360300 What's going on?
6366300 6367500 Damn!
6374180 6376020 Donations totaling<br />three billion dollars...
6376060 6377540 were made today<br />to the Red Cross...
6377580 6378660 the Salvation Army...
6378700 6380980 and the United Nations<br />Children's Fund.
6381020 6382660 The funds were wired<br />from the account...
6382700 6385660 of jailed Russian tycoon<br />Ivan Tretiak.
6385700 6387580 In other philanthropic news...
6387620 6389860 a nonprofit<br />research foundation...
6389900 6393860 has been established to develop<br />cold fusion technology...
6393895 6396060 funded with<br />an anonymous donation...
6396100 6399980 and to be headed by Russian<br />physicist Dr. Lev Botvin.
6400020 6402340 The E.J. Russell Foundation...
6402380 6404260 is charged to develop<br />inexpensive...
6404300 6406785 Light a candle.
6406820 6409185 Lay flowers at the door...
6409220 6411900 for those who're left behind...
6411940 6414780 and the ones<br />who've gone before.
6414860 6416940 Here it comes now...
6416980 6420100 sure as silence follows rain...
6420140 6422980 the taste of you upon my lips...
6423020 6425300 the fingers in my brain.
6425340 6427580 Ever gentle...
6427620 6431300 as it kills me where I lay...
6431340 6433820 who am I to resist?
6433900 6436220 Who are you to fail?
6436260 6440180 Got to get you out of my mind...
6441380 6445780 but I can't escape<br />from the feeling...
6445820 6450580 as I try to leave<br />the memory behind.
6452060 6456580 Without you,<br />what's left to believe in?
6468220 6470620 I'm so sorry...
6470660 6473300 for the way it had to go.
6473335 6475940 Now I feel your presence...
6475980 6478700 in a way I could not know...
6478740 6480780 and I wonder...
6480820 6484260 do you ever feel the same?
6484300 6486460 In the spilling darkness...
6486500 6489740 do you ever hear my name?
6489780 6493660 Got to get you out of my mind...
6494820 6499100 but I can't escape<br />from the feeling...
6499140 6500385 as I...
6500420 6504100 try to leave<br />the memory behind.
6505380 6509740 Without you,<br />what's left to believe in?
6516500 6521060 Deep in the back<br />of your mind...
6527620 6531900 Deep in the back<br />of your mind...
6536060 6538460 And how could you dare...
6538500 6541660 to come so close...
6541700 6544900 when you're just a ghost to me?
6547140 6552260 And I've got to get you<br />out of my mind...
6553420 6557820 but I can't escape<br />from the feeling...
6557900 6559100 as I...
6559140 6562660 try to leave<br />the memory behind.
6564060 6568380 Without you,<br />what's left to believe in?
6575060 6579460 Here in the back of your mind...
6594540 6597220 It's just black-and-white...
6597260 6598700 or color.
6602660 6605140 Those postcards...
6605180 6606860 sent from heaven...
6610420 6612780 says, "Make the most...
6612820 6615460 "of never-never. "
6615500 6618620 Horizon starts right here.
6619980 6623820 The future's always near...
6623860 6624980 and I...
6627980 6630020 I know this time...
6630060 6632220 is borrowed.
6632260 6636300 I try to remember<br />and forget my sorrow...
6639500 6641420 celluloid...
6641460 6643100 monochrome...
6643140 6644620 or color.
6648260 6651700 Don't want to end in tears.
6656420 6660900 I'll leave before<br />my fears are found.
6660940 6663580 Scared to love...
6663620 6666060 wasted knowledge...
6666100 6667700 into the brink...
6671180 6673160 these four walls...
6673195 6675140 are lost forever.
6675180 6677220 I will never...
6677260 6679420 be that clever.
