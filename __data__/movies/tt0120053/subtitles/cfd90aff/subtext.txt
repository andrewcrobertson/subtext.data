1715047 1717675 Dr. Emma Russell!
1725391 1726517 Oops.
1731147 1736611 Well, I didn't prepare<br />any formal remarks.
1736944 1738529 Um, I'm more interested
1738613 1742366 in what questions you<br />all have about cold fusion.
1742491 1746120 So I thought we would start<br />with those. Any questions?
1749373 1752168 - Please?<br />- Yeah, I have, Dr. Russell.
1752752 1757381 Can you explain the actual process<br />of fusion? You know, the theory?
1758215 1760301 Yes. There it is.
1761302 1763721 This is the apparatus.
1764472 1768893 And very simply, when<br />positively charged deuterons
1769060 1771479 are attracted to the palladium cathode,
1771979 1773522 they cram together.
1773606 1778110 There are millions and millions<br />of them getting closer and closer,
1778277 1783115 and then they fuse. And they<br />create energy in the form of helium.
1783199 1787286 But I read that the experiment<br />couldn't be replicated. So...
1787954 1791374 - How do we know it works?<br />- Well, we don't.
1792291 1793709 Not yet.
1794669 1799548 But if you remember, Einstein, he<br />knew the theory of relativity to be true
1799632 1803219 long before he could<br />prove it. He felt the truth.
1803928 1808307 And some of us feel the<br />same way about cold fusion.
1808474 1810726 Because it's there, it's in nature,
1810893 1815272 the raw, natural power<br />just waiting to be harnessed.
1815439 1820111 And when we ignite that cold fusion fire,
1820194 1822697 I mean, just imagine...
1823531 1827159 There's more energy in<br />one cubic mile of sea water
1827326 1830329 than in all the known<br />oil reserves on Earth.
1830955 1837086 You could drive your car 55 million<br />miles on a gallon of heavy water.
1837461 1842800 It would be the end of pollution.<br />Warmth for the whole world.
1844301 1847555 So why don't I, uh, demonstrate for you
1848097 1851892 why other people in the past<br />have been so unsuccessful?
1853561 1854979 They use very complex...

2137177 2139596 Yeah, that's what I like about it.

2499998 2504044 Yes, I do. What's your name?
2505295 2507756 My name is Thomas Moore.
2507923 2511551 I was named after a saint...

5156944 5161324 DR. BOTVIN: I have run every<br />test on this cold fusion formula,
5161407 5168080 and must conclude that it is not<br />merely incomplete, but impossible.
5168289 5172376 You may as well try to create<br />perpetual motion, Mr. Tretiak.
5173002 5175338 I invest millions,
5177048 5179884 and you can't make it work!
5183596 5186307 What are you doing with my money?
5188809 5194273 Do you think it comes so easy? No!
5194440 5200154 Sir, I have been working for<br />nearly two weeks without sleep.
5201113 5205451 At first blush, the theorem appears<br />quite impressive. Convincing.
5205534 5207036 It does?
5211749 5215795 Yes, it does.
5216629 5220549 Good man. We can use<br />it to destroy our enemies.
5223052 5225805 <i>Only Dr. Russell can spoil my plan.</i>
5225971 5228808 If she gets back to London<br />and speaks to the press.
5228891 5234105 From here to the airport are three<br />army checkpoints, all loyal to us.
5234563 5239652 Make sure they all get the message.<br />She doesn't leave Moscow alive.
5242154 5246534 Mr. President, as former Vice<br />Minister of Energy and Power,
5247034 5251705 I hear all manner of schemes<br />that provide cheaper energy.
5251872 5254917 And as our countrymen freeze to death,
5255626 5259004 I've become aware of a<br />marvelous new technology,
5259171 5264635 about which I'm hopelessly out of<br />my league from a scientific viewpoint.
5264927 5267847 That's why I brought our<br />eminent physicist here,
5268013 5271350 Dr. Lev Botvin from the<br />University of Moscow.
5271517 5276730 Before we are dazzled by the good<br />news, let's dispense with the bad.
5276897 5278983 What is the price of this marvel?
5279150 5282486 The cost of research and<br />development are there,
5282570 5284947 which is all you are asked to defray.
5291245 5294039 Ten billion in hard currency?
5294123 5298294 I can't even pay my teachers,<br />my miners, my doctors.
5306010 5307887 Where are you heading?
5308387 5311599 I thought we'd drink<br />some vodka to get warmer.
5316187 5322193 Like the miracle of socialism,<br />our miracle of cold fusion failed.
5322359 5327781 But no matter. We have sold<br />cold fusion to President Karpov.
5327948 5331410 We will use the scandal<br />of his failure to destroy him.
5331577 5334246 The army must be mobilized<br />by midnight tomorrow.
5334330 5338000 You're in a hurry, Ivan<br />Petrovich. That's one day.
5338209 5340461 ILYA: Not now, old witch, we're working.
5341086 5343255 TRETIAK: Yes, think of it.
5343339 5348052 In one day you can be proud<br />again to be a Russian general.
5348928 5352765 With a big nuclear missile<br />where your prick used to be.
5353724 5355976 You have to fill out a form<br />before we put you on a flight.
5356060 5357910 Medical problems, that sort of thing.
5358020 5361982 - Oh, I have a heart condition.<br />- Do you need any medication?
5363025 5367196 Well, I haven't needed<br />a pill. That's strange.
5367363 5370533 Get a form from down the<br />corridor. I'll be back in ten.
