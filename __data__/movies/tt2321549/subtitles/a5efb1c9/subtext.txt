81576 83159 Mum!
99635 101094 Mum!
104098 105557 Mummy!
108728 110270 Mum!
112273 113773 Mum!
114984 117027 I had the dream again.
126579 128807 "And he climbed down<br />that chimney,
128831 132227 "straight into<br />the huge black pot.
132251 136504 "And that was the end of<br />the big, bad wolf."
140259 142613 Did they really kill the wolf,<br />Mum?
142637 145198 I'm sure they did.
145222 147701 I'll kill the monster<br />when it comes.
147725 149893 I'll smash its head in.
152313 154291 It's time to go to sleep now,<br />sweetie.
154315 155834 It's very late.
155858 158777 Can we read it again?
161906 165510 "A long time ago -<br />just yesterday, in fact -
165534 170580 "there were three little pigs<br />and one nasty big wolf."
242695 243839 What have you done?
243863 245674 It's not broken.<br />It just slipped.
245698 248051 I don't want you firing<br />things off in the house anymore.
248075 251221 Wait, wait, wait. Watch this. When the<br />monster comes, I'm gonna do this.
251245 252453 Please don't!
256125 257477 Nothing in my hands.
257501 260105 - Nothing in my hands.<br />- Stand still, please.
260129 261690 Look at me, Mum!
261714 262941 Come on, Samuel.
262965 265277 - Look at me.<br />- Stand still, please.
265301 267195 Nothing in my hands.<br />Nothing in my hands.
267219 268780 I don't want you<br />making weapons anymore.
268804 270782 It doesn't work<br />if you don't look at me.
270806 274017 This monster thing<br />has got to stop, alright?
287531 289782 Don't do that!
292495 293953 Ready?
296207 297832 Come on.
302338 303940 Quick. You're late already.
303964 305734 What have you got in there?
305758 307258 See you later, alligator.
316936 319414 Here's one for you, Norma.<br />It's got milk in it.
319438 320582 What?
320606 322542 One with your milk in it.
322566 324419 I don't want milk.
324443 327320 No worries.<br />I'll make you another one.
331116 333929 Ah, just where a woman<br />should be. In the kitchen.
333953 336371 Hmm. Get to work, woman.
337248 338391 Do you want a cuppa?
338415 341459 Nah. I'm heading for<br />the dementia ward.
342545 344629 It's a few years before<br />you end up there, isn't it?
345506 347215 Right?
352096 352906 Amelia?
352930 354681 Your son's school<br />is on the phone.
359687 361289 Oh, my God.
361313 362707 Did he hurt anyone?
362731 365149 A dart could have gone into<br />a child's eye or even worse.
366443 368255 I'm going to have a serious talk<br />with him.
368279 370590 Mrs Fanning,<br />we've had the talks.
370614 372300 We've had the sessions<br />with the counsellor.
372324 376471 We're going to have to employ<br />a monitor for him.
376495 377764 Monitor?
377788 379724 He'll be separated<br />from the other children.
379748 382561 The monitor will supervise him<br />one-on-one.
382585 383937 Samuel won't cope with this.
383961 385397 He already feels so different.
385421 388275 I'll have a talk with him.<br />I'll have a serious talk...
388299 389401 Mrs Fanning,
389425 391862 the boy has significant<br />behavioural problems.
391886 395740 You know, Samuel doesn't need<br />a full-time monitor.
395764 397993 What he needs<br />is some understanding.
398017 400704 I have 24 other<br />first graders in that class.
400728 403206 Do you want me to put them<br />all at risk because of your son?
403230 404833 I think I'll just find<br />another school.
404857 407335 Mrs Fanning, you can't just<br />take the boy out of school.
407359 409379 You look after your business<br />and I'll go and find a school
409403 411172 that sees my son<br />as a human being
411196 413174 and not just as another problem<br />to be gotten rid of.
413198 416177 That is very unfair. We're only<br />trying to help the boy.
416201 418638 Please stop calling him<br />'the boy'.
418662 420872 His name is Samuel.
428088 430984 We can see Ruby and<br />Aunty Claire at the park today.
431008 433153 You can play<br />on that swing you like
433177 435071 for as long as you like, OK?
435095 438116 Mrs Bruen hates me.
438140 439766 No, she doesn't.
441435 443227 Just need a break, that's all.
445397 447523 Don't tell Aunty Claire<br />what happened.
449318 451778 I'll tell her later.
453572 456908 - Mum, come and look at this!<br />- I can do it again.
458702 460388 Sam, don't bother the lady.
460412 462015 No, no, no. That's alright.
462039 463892 We have to go home and<br />see Daddy, though, haven't we?
463916 465518 My dad's in the cemetery.
465542 466728 Oh. That's...
466752 469731 He got killed driving Mum<br />to the hospital to have me.
469755 472442 Samuel.
472466 473860 I'm sorry. He just...
473884 476738 No, that's alright.<br />I shouldn't have...
476762 479866 Well, your mum is very lucky<br />to have you, then, isn't she?
479890 481660 We have to go.
481684 483893 - Say, "See you later," Katie.<br />- Bye.
485062 486957 The artist was so drunk,<br />he vomited.
486981 488625 Right in front of<br />his own installation.
488649 490627 Lost all these sales.
490651 492671 You're not listening.
492695 494422 I am. I am.
494446 497550 So you lost all these sales<br />and then what happened?
497574 499552 Ruby! Don't play there.<br />It's wet.
499576 502138 Mum! Mum!
502162 504997 I'm gonna smash its head!
507418 510336 - Be careful.<br />- Mum, Mum! I'm gonna smash it.
513382 515652 What would you like me<br />to do for Wednesday?
515676 518845 I can get their birthday cakes.<br />That's easy.
520681 523141 I was hoping Ruby<br />would change her mind.
524727 527247 She doesn't want a joint party<br />with Sam this year.
527271 530542 Mum! Mum!
530566 532127 She wants to have<br />a princess party.
532151 534379 Mum! Mum!
534403 535880 That's OK.
535904 538133 We don't have to come.
538157 540093 You can still come.
540117 541219 Mum!
541243 543430 She just doesn't want to share<br />the day with Sam anymore.
543454 545515 - I understand. I understand.<br />- Mum!
545539 548875 Mum, I can go really high!<br />Watch.
552046 553940 Maybe you want to celebrate<br />his birthday properly
553964 555233 this year, anyway.
555257 557592 - On the day.<br />- Yeah, we'll see.
558761 561322 You know, Amelia,<br />I just want you to be happy
561346 563324 and then this birthday thing<br />rolls around
563348 564534 and I end up feeling awful.
564558 566078 I don't want you to feel awful,<br />Claire.
567603 569039 We'll be fine.
569063 570206 We'll be absolutely fine.
570230 571981 Mum! Look at me!
577446 579280 Mama!
584620 587640 - Who do we have here?<br />- Hello, Mrs Roach.
587664 589642 You look tired, little one.
589666 591978 Have you been in the wars today?
592002 593396 A few wars.
593420 596066 He's had a big day, that's all.
596090 597692 He's just exhausted.
597716 599527 Poor little sweetheart.
599551 600945 Bugsy.
600969 602697 Come here, little girl. Hello.
602721 605325 You look tired too, love.
605349 606743 You OK?
606767 608976 Nothing five years of sleep<br />wouldn't fix.
609978 611873 I'll put your rubbish out<br />for you, Grace.
611897 614626 No, no, no.<br />You've just got in, pet.
614650 616234 I'll do it now. Then it's done.
656400 658234 You can choose one tonight.
665200 666719 Where did you get this?
666743 668244 On the shelf.
674751 677605 "If it's in a word<br />or it's in a look,
677629 680423 "you can't get rid of<br />the Babadook.
683302 686865 "If you're a really clever one<br />and you know what it is to see,
686889 689868 "then you can make friends<br />with a special one -
689892 691434 "a friend of you and me."
696273 701296 "His name is Mister Babadook<br />and this is his book.
701320 706009 "A rumbling sound,<br />then three sharp knocks -
706033 709554 "ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!
709578 712599 "That's when you'll know<br />he's around.
712623 714957 "You'll see him if you look.
717669 721566 "Ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!"
721590 723526 We might read another one<br />tonight, hey?
723550 725426 But you said I could choose.
729973 732702 "This is what he wears on top.
732726 734894 "He's funny, don't you think?
738065 740232 "See him<br />in your room at night..."
742444 744445 Mum? Does it hurt the boy?
746615 747842 Mum?
747866 750660 Does it live under the bed? Mum?
752204 753746 Mummy?
755832 757458 Mummy?!
758710 759771 "How sweetly they sung,
759795 761522 "telling of the happiness<br />and loveliness
761546 763691 "that lay at the bottom of<br />the ocean
763715 766258 and entreating the sirens<br />not to be afraid."
835662 838599 It's that time of<br />night again.
838623 839267 Time...
839291 841728 If that's what<br />the doctor ordered, I...
841752 844128 Oh, yeah. Yeah.<br />That's what the doctor ordered.
858060 859643 Do you...
944855 946082 Mum!
946106 947917 - It's in my room!<br />- What is?
947941 949710 - The Babadook!<br />- Oh, no.
949734 954424 No, no, no.<br />This is not going to happen.
954448 957176 The closet doors were closed<br />and now they're wide open.
957200 959178 It's just a book.
959202 961556 It can't hurt you.
961580 964308 You've had a big day.
964332 966959 You're just exhausted.
968211 971714 I don't want anything bad<br />to happen to you, Mum.
973925 977405 Nothing bad's going to happen,<br />Sam.
977429 979972 I'm gonna protect you.
1050126 1052795 Mum, it's 9:00.
1063890 1065993 He's not running a fever<br />anymore.
1066017 1070373 No, no, no. My sister's gonna<br />take him. Put it back!
1070397 1072231 Put it back<br />or it goes in the bin.
1073483 1075461 Sorry. What was that?
1075485 1079006 Oh, no. I couldn't get to<br />the phone. He was vomiting.
1079030 1081884 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />No worries. I'll see you soon.
1081908 1085285 Samuel, no monster talk<br />at Aunty Claire's, OK?
1086496 1090541 Samuel - no Babadook.<br />No nothing. Alright?
1098300 1100903 88. Number 88.
1100927 1102822 Two fat ladies.
1102846 1104448 Good, Elaine!
1104472 1107099 Another few days and someone<br />could call out, "Bingo!"
1110604 1111914 Number 11.
1111938 1113666 Who has number 11?
1113690 1115751 Legs 11.
1115775 1118610 Hey? See what else we've got.
1120947 1122925 5 billion.
1122949 1125367 Anyone got 5 billion?
1136463 1139214 Beverley's not very impressed<br />with your bingo skills.
1142344 1144905 - Are you alright?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
1144929 1147658 No, I'm fine. How are you?<br />How's D wing?
1147682 1150893 Fine. Yeah.<br />Just a bunch of old people.
1153521 1156375 You don't have to be fine,<br />you know.
1156399 1159795 Just a bit stressed<br />at the moment.
1159819 1161653 Why don't you go home?
1162781 1166218 Old cranky bitch -<br />she goes after lunch.
1166242 1167136 I can cover for you.
1167160 1169787 - You'd do that?<br />- Yeah.
1171539 1173476 I'll give you my pay.
1173500 1175394 Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.
1175418 1177688 You've got a sick boy.
1177712 1179565 Life's too short.
1179589 1182466 You're so sweet, Robbie.
1183677 1185988 - You should go.<br />- Yeah.
1186012 1189223 - Say hi to Sam for me.<br />- I will.
1239941 1243379 Where have you been?<br />You weren't at work.
1243403 1244630 Rung you a million times.
1244654 1245673 What happened?
1245697 1247758 Just scared the crap<br />out of Ruby. That's all.
1247782 1250928 He insisted on talking to this<br />bloody Babadook thing all day.
1250952 1253180 Just talking to the air -<br />even freaked me out.
1253204 1254223 I'm so sorry.
1254247 1255683 You need to get him<br />to see someone, Amelia.
1255707 1257601 It's not normal for a kid<br />to carry on with this rubbish.
1257625 1259061 It's not rubbish. It's real!
1259085 1261211 Don't you talk to<br />your Aunty Claire like that.
1263923 1265609 Where did you get<br />those firecrackers?
1265633 1267528 You got them for me<br />on the internet.
1267552 1268992 Well,<br />that's the end of the internet.
1271306 1274160 If the Babadook was real, we'd<br />see it right now, wouldn't we?
1274184 1277788 It wants to scare you first<br />then you'll see it.
1277812 1279623 Well, I'm not scared.
1279647 1282752 You will be when it creeps<br />into your room at night.
1282776 1284420 That's enough.
1284444 1287006 You will be<br />when it eats your insides.
1287030 1287840 I've decided
1287864 1289717 you're not having your birthday<br />with Ruby this week.
1289741 1291450 No cake, no games.<br />That's the end of it.
1296122 1297664 Samuel.
1307091 1311155 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />Mum and Dad,
1311179 1313824 life is not always as it seems.
1313848 1317077 It can be a wondrous thing.
1317101 1321521 But it can also be<br />very treacherous.
1329572 1332885 Don't worry, Dad. I'll save Mum.
1332909 1335911 I'm gonna trap<br />the Babadook like this.
1338832 1342019 And when it's trapped,<br />I'm gonna kill it.
1342043 1344127 Samuel.
1353471 1355324 I was just<br />putting something back.
1355348 1356742 All your father's things<br />are down there.
1356766 1357785 He's my father.
1357809 1359935 You don't own him!
1361646 1363897 Just thought I'd see<br />how you're going.
1367360 1368694 Can I come in?
1370029 1373133 Hey, matey. This is for you.
1373157 1375928 My mum always got me a model<br />plane when I was sick.
1375952 1377452 I'm not sick.
1379080 1381392 Oh. I-I thought...
1381416 1383060 No, he's not, actually.
1383084 1386146 The truth is he's so disobedient<br />he can't go to school anymore.
1386170 1387189 You said that's not true.
1387213 1388732 How many 6-year-old boys<br />do you know, Robbie,
1388756 1389900 who still believe in monsters?
1389924 1391068 I hate you!
1391092 1392611 She won't let me have<br />a birthday party
1392635 1395679 and she won't let me have a dad!
1469295 1470545 Don't eat it.
1483559 1485477 The Babadook did it, Mum.
1487146 1488707 Go and watch a DVD<br />and I'll make something else.
1488731 1490250 The Babadook did it!
1490274 1492044 Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.
1492068 1494713 Ladies and gentlemen,
1494737 1496799 girls and boys,
1496823 1502262 welcome to the great Martin's<br />DVD 'School of Magic'.
1502286 1505349 Life is not always as it seems.
1505373 1509478 It can be a wondrous thing.
1509502 1513524 But it can also be<br />very treacherous.
1513548 1515859 In this DVD,
1515883 1520489 you will learn magic tricks<br />to surprise, to delight
1520513 1526143 and perhaps even shock<br />your family and friends.
1549542 1551293 Do you think this is funny?
1552670 1555589 Oh, no. No. No!
1557633 1559301 Give it to me!
1560845 1563513 Do you wanna die?
1636003 1638565 Don't let it in!<br />Don't let it in!
1638589 1642277 Don't let it in! Don't<br />let it in! Don't let it in!
1642301 1644094 Don't let it in!
1714957 1718376 Mum, do we have to<br />go to Ruby's party?
1728763 1731283 I've already got this doll, Mum.
1731307 1732618 Now she's got a twin.
1732642 1733850 They can go shopping together.
1738439 1741084 Off you go.
1741108 1743485 He's just really tired.
1748324 1750825 Go and play right now.
1757333 1759978 Claire tells me you're a writer.
1760002 1762689 Oh, no, not really. Not anymore.
1762713 1765192 What kind of writing did you do?
1765216 1769154 I wrote some articles for some<br />magazines, did some kids' stuff.
1769178 1771573 You just need to get<br />back into it. That's all.
1771597 1773033 It must be difficult.
1773057 1776495 I do volunteer work<br />with some disadvantaged women
1776519 1779248 and a few of them<br />have lost their husbands
1779272 1781940 and they find it very hard.
1783818 1785462 How's Richard's merger going?
1785486 1789716 Oh, good. I mean,<br />his workload's just ballooned.
1789740 1792511 I've got the kids 24/7,<br />it feels like.
1792535 1793679 Tell me about it!
1793703 1796014 I don't even have time to go to the gym<br />anymore. It's ridiculous!
1796038 1797641 That's a real tragedy.
1797665 1800978 Not having time to go to the gym<br />anymore. How do you cope?
1801002 1803063 You must have so much<br />to talk about
1803087 1804754 with those poor<br />disadvantaged women.
1816183 1819871 This is my tree house.<br />You're not allowed in here.
1819895 1821354 I'm not hurting anybody.
1823899 1825734 Bye.
1827695 1829738 - Thanks.<br />- Thanks.
1835703 1837639 How would your mum know<br />if it's real or not?
1837663 1839683 She never comes to our house.
1839707 1842185 Mum told Dad she didn't want<br />to go to your house
1842209 1844062 'cause it's too depressing.
1844086 1847065 The Babadook would eat your mum<br />for breakfast.
1847089 1849609 - It'd rip her arms off.<br />- Shut up!
1849633 1852821 They feel sorry for me, Claire.<br />There's a big difference.
1852845 1855240 God, Amelia, as soon as anyone<br />mentions Oskar, you can't cope.
1855264 1857826 - That's not true.<br />- It'll be seven years.
1857850 1859286 Isn't it time you moved on?
1859310 1860829 I have moved on.
1860853 1864291 I don't mention him.<br />I don't talk about him.
1864315 1866418 What strain is that on you,<br />Claire?
1866442 1869212 You're not even<br />good enough to have a dad.
1869236 1871256 Everyone else has one<br />and you don't.
1871280 1872924 I do have a dad!
1872948 1875802 I listen to your life<br />day in, day out,
1875826 1878889 and you never stop to ask me<br />anything about mine.
1878913 1880140 I do!
1880164 1881850 I want to know how you are.
1881874 1883560 You don't come round<br />to our house anymore.
1883584 1885771 Because I can't stand<br />being around your son.
1885795 1888398 I can't believe<br />you just said that.
1888422 1890942 You can't stand being around him<br />yourself.
1890966 1893445 Your dad died so he didn't<br />have to be with you.
1893469 1894946 That's not true!
1894970 1896156 And your mum doesn't want you.
1896180 1898515 No-one wants you.
1909610 1910796 What did you do?!
1910820 1913488 She said I didn't have a dad.<br />She kept saying it.
1915116 1916718 Is she alright?
1916742 1919346 Stay here<br />and look after the children
1919370 1921431 or do you want another one<br />to get hurt?
1921455 1926520 Mummy!<br />She wouldn't believe me!
1926544 1929022 Mummy! Mummy!
1929046 1930941 Mummy!
1930965 1934968 - Mummy! Mummy!<br />- Why can't you just be normal?!
1936554 1938847 There is no Babadook!
1940599 1942851 Get out!
1945521 1948166 - Get out!<br />- Samuel?
1948190 1950419 - Mummy!<br />- Stop this now!
1950443 1953319 Get out! Get out! Get out!
1972506 1973733 Please help me!
1973757 1975925 There's something wrong<br />with my son.
1987813 1991001 I think it may have been<br />a febrile convulsion.
1991025 1992878 That's when the brain overheats.
1992902 1994212 It always looks worse<br />than it is.
1994236 1996089 I've never seen<br />anything like this.
1996113 1998175 We'll have to wait<br />until the tests come back.
1998199 1999968 All his other results<br />are normal.
1999992 2004139 He's obviously suffering<br />a high level of anxiety.
2004163 2005891 Very committed to<br />the monster theory.
2005915 2007290 That's an understatement.
2008417 2011021 All children see monsters.
2011045 2012795 Not like this.
2014131 2016193 And it's getting worse.
2016217 2018904 He's becoming aggressive.
2018928 2020489 He could see a psychiatrist.
2020513 2022115 I can refer you.
2022139 2023700 Takes a few weeks to get in.
2023724 2024933 That'd be great.
2026852 2030165 But can you just give me<br />something for now,
2030189 2032649 just to make him sleep?
2033776 2035401 Um, just until...
2036695 2038863 ...just until<br />we get an appointment.
2040074 2042219 Please?
2042243 2047015 I haven't slept in weeks<br />and neither has Samuel
2047039 2048433 and when we go home tonight,
2048457 2050435 this whole nightmare<br />will start up again
2050459 2051686 and I am really...
2051710 2054587 ...I'm really not coping.
2056840 2061446 I can give you<br />a short course of sedatives.
2061470 2063865 Just until the tests come back.
2063889 2068745 Most mothers aren't too keen<br />on them unless it's really bad.
2068769 2070770 It's really bad.
2077987 2082551 These can make children<br />feel foggy.
2082575 2084803 Perhaps some temporary nausea.
2084827 2088014 They'll certainly<br />help him sleep, though.
2088038 2091624 - That's for one week.<br />- Thank you.
2093752 2096106 Why don't people<br />like me?
2096130 2098191 Why do you say that?
2098215 2102135 Ruby said people don't like me<br />'cause I'm weird.
2103387 2107348 Sometimes people say things<br />that aren't true.
2110936 2115000 You just need to take<br />your medicine, have a big sleep
2115024 2116399 and not worry.
2117901 2119671 I don't want you to die.
2119695 2122799 I'm not gonna die<br />for a long time yet.
2122823 2127076 Did you think that about my dad<br />before he died?
2131206 2134811 Just take your pill<br />so you can go to sleep.
2134835 2137147 I've got the day off tomorrow.
2137171 2139190 Maybe we could do something,
2139214 2142569 Will these make<br />the Babadook go away?
2142593 2144279 I think so
2144303 2146156 but you have to promise me<br />not to mention it again.
2146180 2150201 I promise to protect you<br />if you promise to protect me.
2150225 2152037 Then I won't mention it.
2152061 2156374 I promise to protect you.
2156398 2158107 Come on.
2169370 2170536 Come on.
2177044 2179522 Can you stay here with me?
2179546 2181441 Yes.
2181465 2183777 I love you, Mum.
2183801 2185593 Me too.
2367985 2370296 Her nose<br />is broken in two places.
2370320 2371130 She may need surgery.
2371154 2372507 I'll pay for everything.
2372531 2374259 You can't even pay<br />your own bills.
2374283 2375635 Look, I really have to go.
2375659 2379430 Claire, I think someone<br />is stalking me and Samuel.
2379454 2380807 What?
2380831 2382851 A book turned up<br />at our place.
2382875 2386479 I threw it away but somebody<br />glued it back together
2386503 2388273 and put it on our doorstep.
2388297 2391693 Amelia,<br />I just can't help you right now.
2391717 2394654 I don't expect you to help.<br />I just wanted...
2394678 2396906 If you're that worried,<br />you should go to the police.
2396930 2399765 I have to go.
2418493 2420202 Claire!
2422080 2423456 Hello?
2425125 2429606 Mmm, Babadook...
2429630 2433716 ...dook... dook.
2440140 2443036 Hi.
2443060 2446998 I want to report someone<br />stalking me and my child.
2447022 2448333 Can you tell us what happened?
2448357 2451317 Somebody sent me<br />a children's book.
2453028 2455381 And?
2455405 2458551 And it contained violent<br />and graphic images
2458575 2460595 of my child and me<br />being murdered.
2460619 2462597 Can we have a look at the book,<br />please?
2462621 2464849 I burnt it.
2464873 2467560 You burnt it?
2467584 2468686 Yes.
2468710 2471212 Well, unfortunately, there's<br />nothing we can do about it.
2473048 2476861 He's been making phone calls<br />to me as well.
2476885 2478154 What's he been saying?
2478178 2481824 Nothing,<br />just making these... noises.
2481848 2483660 How do you know<br />it's the same person?
2483684 2486120 Because of what<br />he wrote in the book.
2486144 2487872 The book you burnt?
2487896 2490064 Yes.
2506415 2507540 OK.
2509126 2511127 Don't worry about it.
2520804 2522907 Did you get your things done?
2522931 2525076 Mrs Roach has Parkinson's.
2525100 2526869 That's why she shakes like this.
2526893 2528621 Samuel, you don't have to<br />say everything
2528645 2529872 that goes through your head.
2529896 2532458 Oh, it's alright, love.
2532482 2537463 He wanted to know<br />so we talked about it.
2537487 2540133 He sees things as they are,<br />that one.
2540157 2541843 Oskar was the same.
2541867 2543553 He always spoke his mind.
2543577 2546454 Do you have to<br />keep on bringing him up?
2552461 2553938 Hey, Bugsy.
2553962 2556983 Hey.
2557007 2559383 Hey!
2574483 2576233 Eugh!
2625200 2627451 Don't come in here.
2639881 2642276 I don't want to buy anything.
2642300 2644362 Are you Amelia Vanick?
2644386 2645404 Yes.
2645428 2647990 I'm Warren Newton<br />and this is Prue Flannery
2648014 2649784 from the Department of<br />Community Services.
2649808 2651828 My son's only been<br />away for two days.
2651852 2655373 He's not actually registered<br />at Babbage Bay anymore.
2655397 2657583 If I could just come in<br />and meet Samuel
2657607 2659688 and get you to look at<br />these papers, that'd be great.
2660777 2664257 I'm just in the middle<br />of cleaning up the house
2664281 2665842 at the moment.
2665866 2669827 I'm sorry.<br />There's stuff everywhere.
2672455 2674809 Hello, Samuel.
2674833 2678836 I'm Prue and this is Warren.
2680338 2681858 How are you?
2681882 2685570 I'm a bit tired from the drugs<br />Mum gave me.
2685594 2689657 Not drugs. Tranquillisers...<br />from the doctor.
2689681 2691534 He had a fit yesterday.
2691558 2694954 I'm really tired, actually.
2694978 2696687 That's no good.
2699566 2701711 May I have a glass of water,<br />please?
2701735 2706071 Yes. Of course. I'll get you one.
2712954 2714932 It's a real mess.
2714956 2717351 I just found<br />this cockroach infestation.
2717375 2718895 I normally have<br />the house sprayed.
2718919 2720771 I did actually already<br />have it sprayed
2720795 2723608 but there's this hole<br />in the wall behind the fridge
2723632 2725299 and that's why I...
2730138 2732783 I didn't mean<br />a hole in the wall.
2732807 2735286 There was a hole<br />in the wallpaper.
2735310 2737580 That's where they were<br />laying their eggs, I think.
2737604 2739772 We've caught you<br />at a bad time.
2741066 2742752 I'll leave you with this.
2742776 2745379 We're required<br />to come back in a week
2745403 2747173 to talk through your options.
2747197 2749406 Here's my card.
2750659 2755371 Mum,<br />I think I'm gonna vomit.
2774891 2777411 What was<br />that noise I heard?
2777435 2780289 I didn't hear any noise.
2780313 2782583 Wind howling,<br />doors slamming.
2782607 2785567 I declare, I think this house<br />is haunted.
2786111 2789840 Mum, I'm gonna go to bed.
2789864 2791842 Are you sick?
2791866 2793158 Oh, no, Granny.
2794786 2796847 It's only 6:00.
2796871 2799600 Don't you want to stay up<br />with your mum for a while?
2799624 2801060 No.
2801084 2804128 If you go to bed now,<br />the pills won't work properly.
2807590 2811301 You have to stay up for a while,<br />sweetheart.
2826192 2828254 Where's its mother,<br />Skip?
2828278 2829839 Koalas don't leave<br />their babies about.
2829863 2831882 Are you off now, Dad?
2831906 2833592 Yep.<br />Soon as I fuel up.
2833616 2835553 Tell Jerry I'll keep in touch<br />on the radio
2835577 2837818 and I'll be back before breakfast<br />the day after tomorrow.
2839331 2841600 "And the Prince<br />and the Princess
2841624 2844562 "lived happily together<br />in a beautiful palace
2844586 2847087 "for the rest of their days."
2949816 2953546 Babadook...
2953570 2957531 ...dook... dook.
2991900 2994462 What are we doing?
2994486 2996297 We're going downstairs.
2996321 2998697 - Why?<br />- Because we are.
3017509 3020446 Iris, Iris, Iris.
3020470 3022304 No.
3071896 3073707 Glass and mirror attachment.
3073731 3075709 Clean and polish<br />shower doors or mirrors
3075733 3077253 for a streak-free shine.
3077277 3078629 As part of<br />your steaming special,
3078653 3080464 we'll even include<br />the garment and upholst...
3080488 3083991 Oh, I don't want to give it<br />to anyone at work.
3085743 3088764 Alright.<br />Give all my shifts away.
3088788 3090122 That's just what I need.
3092041 3093394 I can't help it if I'm sick.
3093418 3094835 What do you expect me to do?
3096045 3097629 You do that!
3112103 3116857 Mum, I took the pills<br />but I feel sick again.
3118568 3121319 I need to eat something.
3125450 3129161 I couldn't find any food<br />in the fridge.
3130955 3134226 You said to have them with food.
3134250 3138188 I'm really hungry, Mum.
3138212 3142318 Why do you have to keep talk,<br />talk, talking?
3142342 3144278 Don't you ever stop?
3144302 3147906 - I was just...<br />- I need to sleep!
3147930 3151410 I'm sorry, Mummy.<br />I was just really hungry.
3151434 3155687 If you're that hungry,<br />why don't you go and eat shit?
3189222 3190866 I'm so sorry.
3190890 3194059 I don't know why I said that.<br />It was terrible.
3195311 3198916 I've had absolutely no sleep.
3198940 3201316 I didn't know what I was saying.
3203111 3205070 I'll cook you something. Hey?
3206406 3207716 What would you like?
3207740 3209699 I'm not hungry anymore.
3216749 3218644 We really need to get<br />out of this house.
3218668 3221128 We've been cooped up here<br />too long. That's the problem.
3225967 3227843 Do you want to go to Wally's?
3228970 3231490 You can have anything you want.<br />Alright?
3231514 3235225 Even ice-cream for breakfast<br />if you like.
3237603 3240749 Give it back!
3240773 3244837 - Stop it! Sit down. Sit down.<br />- No!
3244861 3246797 - Now!<br />- Give my drink back!
3246821 3248238 Sit down, please.
3254454 3255681 Where are we going?
3255705 3258790 I just want to drive<br />for a little while.
3270511 3272823 Aarggh!
3272847 3274848 Mummy! Mummy!
3277226 3279436 Babadook.
3290740 3291759 You ran straight into me!
3291783 3296161 I just bought this bloody car.<br />What were you thinking?
3297455 3300017 Oh, driving on the wrong side of<br />the road with a kid in the back.
3300041 3301977 You could've killed someone!
3302001 3304730 Hey!
3304754 3305773 Hey, what are you doing?
3305797 3307756 Hey! Crazy bitch!
3314514 3316932 Hi, sweetheart.
3325024 3326650 Mum?
3328110 3330570 I can call Aunty Claire.
3333491 3336534 I can call<br />and she can come over.
3339956 3341391 Mum?
3341415 3346002 Aunty Claire doesn't want<br />to talk to us anymore.
3347547 3350757 Mum. Mum, look at me.
3376951 3379619 It's nice and warm in here.
3383165 3385375 I don't want you to go away.
3387545 3389754 I'm not going anywhere.
3402143 3403560 Mum?
3411193 3415447 Mum, I don't think<br />we should stay here tonight.
3416782 3418927 I can call Mrs Roach.
3418951 3422787 I don't want you to call anyone.
3425708 3428251 I just need to sleep.
3432423 3434549 - Mum...<br />- Leave it!
3465915 3467957 There's something<br />in the house.
3482598 3484516 There's someone in the house!
3539864 3541550 Mrs Roach...
3541574 3543658 ...can we come and stay<br />the night?
3553085 3555063 Gracie, I'm so sorry.
3555087 3557482 Has someone<br />broken into the house?
3557506 3560569 - Sam said that...<br />- No, no, no. We're fine.
3560593 3562487 Samuel's just being<br />very disobedient again.
3562511 3564781 Oh, I was so worried.
3564805 3566324 I told him not to call anyone.
3566348 3568243 He asked<br />if you could stay the night.
3568267 3571079 No, no, no. We're fine. I just<br />have a headache. That's all.
3571103 3573104 I really have to go, though,<br />now, Gracie.
3574648 3576209 I'm so sorry for troubling you.
3576233 3577794 Yes. Talk soon.
3577818 3579360 No worries. Talk soon.
3581947 3584468 I told you not to call anyone
3584492 3586451 and you deliberately<br />disobeyed me.
3587620 3589806 Do you want to frighten<br />Mrs Roach?
3589830 3592017 An old lady who can hardly walk?
3592041 3593583 Do you want to make her sick?
3595461 3597629 Get that bloody thing off!
3601759 3606865 Is this the only way I can trust<br />you not to embarrass me
3606889 3608389 in front of our neighbours?
3613104 3614687 Is this what I have to do?
3626325 3627469 I'm sorry, Mummy.
3627493 3629721 It's just that the Babadook made<br />you crash the car and then...
3629745 3631723 What'd you say?
3631747 3633391 I said the Babadook...
3633415 3635018 The Babadook isn't real, Samuel.
3635042 3638855 He's just something you've made up<br />in your stupid little head.
3638879 3641399 I just didn't want you<br />to let it in!
3641423 3645112 I'll make sure nothing<br />gets in tonight.
3645136 3646696 Alright, Samuel?
3646720 3649241 Nothing is coming in here<br />tonight.
3649265 3650807 Nothing!
3688012 3690448 I feel sick.
3690472 3694828 If you don't take the pill,<br />you'll feel worse.
3694852 3696454 Mum, I don't think I need...
3696478 3699522 I am the parent and you are<br />the child so take the pill.
3723005 3725214 Good boy.
3747905 3749238 Mum!
3766423 3769967 Hey, Bugsy. Hey, sweetie.
3772137 3774514 Come here, sweetie. Hey?
3775766 3777058 Hey.
3778227 3779769 Hey!
3800708 3802417 Here we go.
3808299 3810466 There's more<br />where that came from.
3826859 3829045 Aarggh!
3829069 3830319 What's the secret?
3832906 3834592 ...letter of Max's, didn't you?
3834616 3836136 No, not for a minute.
3836160 3838013 Don't lie.<br />You called me a Jezebel. Why?
3838037 3840223 - The north, east.<br />- Natural corset.
3840247 3841706 With fresh meat.
3844043 3846938 Only five...
3846962 3849380 You don't wanna go<br />in there all by yourself, do you?
3851258 3853653 Police say the woman<br />used a kitchen knife
3853677 3855238 to stab her son.
3855262 3857407 His body was found<br />in their basement.
3857431 3860160 The woman later attacked<br />officers with a knife.
3860184 3864414 They drew their guns<br />and shot her to death.
3864438 3866374 Little is known about the tragedy
3866398 3870337 but neighbours say the boy was<br />celebrating his birthday today.
3870361 3872779 He had just turned seven.
3887169 3888753 Samuel?
3893050 3894592 Wake up, Mummy.
3897554 3900807 But you're the one who's asleep,<br />sweetheart.
3906355 3908105 Don't go down there.
3912820 3914529 It's not safe.
3951400 3954569 Ohh... I thought you were dead.
3955696 3958239 I thought you were dead.
3972713 3974755 We're gonna be together.
3977384 3979760 You just need to bring me<br />the boy.
4002159 4004637 You mean Samuel?
4004661 4006954 You can bring me the boy.
4009625 4011208 You can bring me the boy.
4013295 4014856 You can bring me the boy.
4014880 4016274 Stop calling him 'the boy'.
4016298 4018485 I think it's going to rain.
4018509 4019926 No.
4111852 4114979 It isn't real. It isn't real.<br />It isn't real.
4127159 4129368 Oh, no.
4134875 4136709 No! No!
4144760 4146260 Bugsy!
4258039 4259790 Samuel!
4265172 4266714 Samuel.
4268508 4272720 Bugsy's hurt<br />and we need to get help.
4275307 4277766 You don't want him to die,<br />do you?
4281772 4283541 Samuel.
4283565 4286609 Are you listening to me?
4290530 4292967 Let me in, you little shit!
4292991 4295428 Let me in!
4295452 4296721 Let me in!
4296745 4298264 Let me in!
4298288 4301248 Let me in!
4323563 4325792 You little pig!
4325816 4329629 Six years old and you're still<br />wetting yourself.
4329653 4331798 You don't know how many times
4331822 4335718 I wished it was you, not him,<br />that died.
4335742 4337470 I just want you to be happy.
4337494 4340621 "I just<br />want you to be happy."
4343959 4345478 Sometimes...
4345502 4349315 ...I just wanna smash<br />your head against a brick wall
4349339 4352568 until your fucking brains<br />pop out.
4352592 4354654 You're not my mother.
4354678 4356239 What did you say?
4356263 4358866 I said<br />you're not my mother!
4358890 4362434 I am your mother!
4364312 4368065 Run, run, run,<br />as fast as you can!
4371444 4372797 Get away!
4372821 4374738 Didn't I tell you<br />not to play with weapons?
4423747 4426726 I'm sorry, love. I know it's late.
4426750 4428895 I just wanted to make sure<br />you were OK.
4428919 4431898 I'm OK.
4431922 4437820 I know... this time of year's<br />terribly hard for you.
4437844 4442116 And I know you don't want me<br />to go on about it, so I won't.
4442140 4444243 But I just wanted you to know
4444267 4447330 that I'd do anything<br />for you and Sam.
4447354 4449396 I love you both.
4452692 4454443 Samuel.
4457322 4458989 I'm sorry.
4461910 4463804 I understand you're scared.
4463828 4467808 I haven't been good<br />since your dad died.
4467832 4470918 I haven't been good at all.
4473713 4477216 I'm sick, Sam. I need help.
4481471 4484223 I just spoke with Mrs Roach.
4487102 4489580 We're going to<br />stay there tonight.
4489604 4492523 Do you want that?
4496987 4500072 I want to make it up to you,<br />Sam.
4511209 4513252 I want you to meet your dad.
4515046 4517589 It's beautiful there.
4519217 4521802 You'll be happy.
4528435 4530102 Sorry, Mummy!
4578568 4580671 Mum!
4580695 4583340 Mum!
4583364 4585574 I'm not leaving you.
4588495 4591413 Mum? Mum?
4598338 4601298 You said<br />we'd protect each other.
4607097 4609431 I know you don't love me.
4610850 4613079 The Babadook won't let you.
4613103 4615437 But I love you, Mum.
4616856 4619233 And I always will.
4628743 4632913 You let it in.<br />You have to get it out!
4637001 4639814 I don't want you to go away.
4639838 4641398 No! No! No!
4641422 4643590 Mummy!
4693683 4695161 Mummy!
4695185 4697246 Mummy!
4697270 4699206 Mummy!
4699230 4701667 Mummy! Mummy!
4701691 4703836 Mummy!
4703860 4705444 Mummy!
4743316 4744710 What is it?
4744734 4746568 You can't get rid of<br />the Babadook.
4777100 4778308 What do you want?
4781896 4783647 What do you want?
4821519 4823247 No.
4823271 4826273 Keep breathing.
4829527 4832696 Put your seat back, sweetheart.<br />10 more minutes and we're there.
4837076 4839119 No.
4843916 4845311 I think it's gonna rain.
4845335 4847335 Stop!
4895551 4897803 You are nothing.
4910149 4911525 You're nothing!
4920952 4923495 This is my house!
4927542 4931002 You are trespassing in my house!
4940638 4945475 If you touch my son again<br />I'll fucking kill you!
4954235 4956403 No!
5000198 5001406 Mummy, don't!
5007580 5009664 Don't!
5115771 5118333 Watch out for your mum's leg,<br />little one.
5118357 5120335 He's fine.<br />I've had the stitches out.
5120359 5122170 What time's the party?
5122194 5123505 Any time after three is fine.
5123529 5125424 I'll see you in a few hours, then.
5125448 5127009 Bye.
5127033 5128802 Bye, Sam.
5128826 5131179 That school's<br />a good choice.
5131203 5133348 I've been doing<br />a lot of reading about it
5133372 5135058 so I think<br />Sam will be happy there.
5135082 5136768 He's been out of school<br />over two weeks now.
5136792 5138812 It's time to get back.
5138836 5142255 We needed some time<br />to sort a few things out.
5143591 5145402 Are you having a party?
5145426 5147154 It's Sam's birthday today.
5147178 5150490 My first birthday<br />I've ever celebrated.
5150514 5151992 That's not true.
5152016 5154620 Yes, it is.<br />My first party on the day.
5154644 5156936 That's unusual.
5159357 5162753 My husband died the day<br />that Sam was born.
5162777 5166029 He got killed driving Mum<br />to the hospital to have me.
5168157 5170218 Sam's just like his dad was.
5170242 5172346 Always speaks his mind.
5172370 5176683 Well, parties are lots of fun,<br />especially when they're yours.
5176707 5181503 My cousin's not coming because<br />I broke her nose in two places.
5183881 5185882 I'll take that for you.
5205403 5206755 Good shot.
5206779 5209049 Look, there's another one!
5209073 5211157 Where's your bowl?
5214120 5217330 Wow. You've got a lot today.
5218916 5220977 Am I ever gonna see it?
5221001 5224420 One day, when you're bigger.
5230136 5234264 You go outside, and you don't<br />come in until I tell you.
5278893 5281079 It's alright.
5281103 5282789 It's alright.
5282813 5284856 It's alright.
5319308 5320994 How was it?
5321018 5323519 It was pretty quiet today.
5325564 5327148 Come here.
5331320 5333738 It's getting much better, Mum.
5337618 5338970 Wait!
5338994 5341120 I have a new trick.
5344583 5347562 Life is not always as it seems.
5347586 5350546 Nothing in my hands.<br />Nothing in my hands.
5355719 5358596 - That's great!<br />- I haven't finished.
5368107 5371317 Abracadabra!
5373821 5375613 How did you do that?
5380911 5382681 Come here, you.
5382705 5383913 Come here.
5394383 5396968 Happy birthday, sweetheart.
