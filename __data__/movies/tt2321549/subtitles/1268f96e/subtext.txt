85776 87359 Mum!
103835 105294 Mum!
108298 109757 Mummy!
112928 114470 Mum!
116473 117973 Mum!
119184 121227 I had the dream again.
130779 133007 "And he climbed down<br />that chimney,"
133031 136427 "straight into<br />the huge black pot."
136451 140704 "And that was the end of<br />the big, bad wolf."
144459 146813 Did they really kill the wolf,<br />Mum?
146837 149398 I'm sure they did.
149422 151901 I'll kill the monster<br />when it comes.
151925 154093 I'll smash its head in.
156513 158491 It's time to go to sleep now,<br />sweetie.
158515 160034 It's very late.
160058 162977 Can we read it again?
166106 169710 "A long time ago -<br />just yesterday, in fact -"
169734 174780 "there were three little pigs<br />and one nasty big wolf."
246895 248039 What have you done?
248063 249874 It's not broken.<br />It just slipped.
249898 252251 I don't want you firing<br />things off in the house anymore.
252275 255421 Wait, wait, wait. Watch this. When the<br />monster comes, I'm gonna do this.
255445 256653 Please don't!
260325 261677 Nothing in my hands.
261701 264305 - Nothing in my hands.<br />- Stand still, please.
264329 265890 Look at me, Mum!
265914 267141 Come on, Samuel.
267165 269477 - Look at me.<br />- Stand still, please.
269501 271395 Nothing in my hands.<br />Nothing in my hands.
271419 272980 I don't want you<br />making weapons anymore.
273004 274982 It doesn't work<br />if you don't look at me.
275006 278217 This monster thing<br />has got to stop, alright?
291731 293982 Don't do that!
296695 298153 Ready?
300407 302032 Come on.
306538 308140 Quick. You're late already.
308164 309934 What have you got in there?
309958 311458 See you later, alligator.
321136 323614 Here's one for you, Norma.<br />It's got milk in it.
323638 324782 What?
324806 326742 One with your milk in it.
326766 328619 I don't want milk.
328643 331520 No worries.<br />I'll make you another one.
335316 338129 Ah, just where a woman<br />should be. In the kitchen.
338153 340571 Hmm. Get to work, woman.
341448 342591 Do you want a cuppa?
342615 345659 Nah. I'm heading for<br />the dementia ward.
346745 348830 It's a few years before<br />you end up there, isn't it?
349706 351415 Right?
356296 357106 Amelia?
357130 358881 Your son's school<br />is on the phone.
363887 365489 Oh, my God.
365513 366907 Did he hurt anyone?
366931 369349 A dart could have gone into<br />a child's eye or even worse.
370643 372455 I'm going to have a serious talk<br />with him.
372479 374790 Mrs Fanning,<br />we've had the talks.
374814 376500 We've had the sessions<br />with the counsellor.
376524 380671 We're going to have to employ<br />a monitor for him.
380695 381964 Monitor?
381988 383924 He'll be separated<br />from the other children.
383948 386761 The monitor will supervise him<br />one-on-one.
386785 388137 Samuel won't cope with this.
388161 389597 He already feels so different.
389621 392475 I'll have a talk with him.<br />I'll have a serious talk...
392499 393601 Mrs Fanning,
393625 396062 the boy has significant<br />behavioural problems.
396086 399940 You know, Samuel doesn't need<br />a full-time monitor.
399964 402193 What he needs<br />is some understanding.
402217 404904 I have 24 other<br />first graders in that class.
404928 407406 Do you want me to put them<br />all at risk because of your son?
407430 409033 I think I'll just find<br />another school.
409057 411535 Mrs Fanning, you can't just<br />take the boy out of school.
411559 413579 You look after your business<br />and I'll go and find a school
413603 415372 that sees my son<br />as a human being
415396 417374 and not just as another problem<br />to be gotten rid of.
417398 420377 That is very unfair. We're only<br />trying to help the boy.
420401 422838 Please stop calling him<br />'the boy'.
422862 425072 His name is Samuel.
432288 435184 We can see Ruby and<br />Aunty Claire at the park today.
435208 437353 You can play<br />on that swing you like
437377 439271 for as long as you like, OK?
439295 442316 Mrs Bruen hates me.
442340 443966 No, she doesn't.
445635 447427 Just need a break, that's all.
449597 451723 Don't tell Aunty Claire<br />what happened.
453518 455978 I'll tell her later.
457772 461108 - Mum, come and look at this!<br />- I can do it again.
462902 464588 Sam, don't bother the lady.
464612 466215 No, no, no. That's alright.
466239 468092 We have to go home and<br />see Daddy, though, haven't we?
468116 469718 My dad's in the cemetery.
469742 470928 Oh. That's...
470952 473931 He got killed driving Mum<br />to the hospital to have me.
473955 476642 Samuel.
476666 478060 I'm sorry. He just...
478084 480938 No, that's alright.<br />I shouldn't have...
480962 484066 Well, your mum is very lucky<br />to have you, then, isn't she?
484090 485860 We have to go.
485884 488093 - Say, "See you later," Katie.<br />- Bye.
489262 491157 The artist was so drunk,<br />he vomited.
491181 492825 Right in front of<br />his own installation.
492849 494827 Lost all these sales.
494851 496871 You're not listening.
496895 498622 I am. I am.
498646 501750 So you lost all these sales<br />and then what happened?
501774 503752 Ruby! Don't play there.<br />It's wet.
503776 506338 Mum! Mum!
506362 509197 I'm gonna smash its head!
511618 514536 - Be careful.<br />- Mum, Mum! I'm gonna smash it.
517582 519852 What would you like me<br />to do for Wednesday?
519876 523045 I can get their birthday cakes.<br />That's easy.
524881 527341 I was hoping Ruby<br />would change her mind.
528927 531447 She doesn't want a joint party<br />with Sam this year.
531471 534742 Mum! Mum!
534766 536327 She wants to have<br />a princess party.
536351 538579 Mum! Mum!
538603 540080 That's OK.
540104 542333 We don't have to come.
542357 544293 You can still come.
544317 545419 Mum!
545443 547630 She just doesn't want to share<br />the day with Sam anymore.
547654 549715 - I understand. I understand.<br />- Mum!
549739 553075 Mum, I can go really high!<br />Watch.
556246 558140 Maybe you want to celebrate<br />his birthday properly
558164 559433 this year, anyway.
559457 561792 - On the day.<br />- Yeah, we'll see.
562961 565522 You know, Amelia,<br />I just want you to be happy
565546 567524 and then this birthday thing<br />rolls around
567548 568734 and I end up feeling awful.
568758 570343 I don't want you to feel awful,<br />Claire.
571803 573239 We'll be fine.
573263 574406 We'll be absolutely fine.
574430 576181 Mum! Look at me!
581646 583480 Mama!
588820 591840 - Who do we have here?<br />- Hello, Mrs Roach.
591864 593842 You look tired, little one.
593866 596178 Have you been in the wars today?
596202 597596 A few wars.
597620 600266 He's had a big day, that's all.
600290 601892 He's just exhausted.
601916 603727 Poor little sweetheart.
603751 605145 Bugsy.
605169 606897 Come here, little girl. Hello.
606921 609525 You look tired too, love.
609549 610943 You OK?
610967 613176 Nothing five years of sleep<br />wouldn't fix.
614178 616073 I'll put your rubbish out<br />for you, Grace.
616097 618826 No, no, no.<br />You've just got in, pet.
618850 620434 I'll do it now. Then it's done.
660600 662434 You can choose one tonight.
669400 670919 Where did you get this?
670943 672444 On the shelf.
678951 681805 "If it's in a word<br />or it's in a look,"
681829 684623 "you can't get rid of<br />the Babadook."
687502 691065 "If you're a really clever one<br />and you know what it is to see,"
691089 694068 "then you can make friends<br />with a special one -"
694092 695634 "a friend of you and me."
700473 705496 "His name is Mister Babadook<br />and this is his book."
705520 710209 "A rumbling sound,<br />then three sharp knocks -"
710233 713754 "ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!"
713778 716799 "That's when you'll know<br />he's around."
716823 719157 "You'll see him if you look."
721869 725766 "Ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!"
725790 727726 We might read another one<br />tonight, hey?
727750 729626 But you said I could choose.
734173 736902 "This is what he wears on top."
736926 739094 "He's funny, don't you think?"
742265 744432 "See him<br />in your room at night..."
746644 748645 Mum? Does it hurt the boy?
750815 752042 Mum?
752066 754860 Does it live under the bed? Mum?
756404 757946 Mummy?
760032 761658 Mummy?!
762910 763971 "How sweetly they sung,
763995 765722 "telling of the happiness<br />and loveliness
765746 767891 "that lay at the bottom of<br />the ocean
767915 770458 and entreating the sirens<br />not to be afraid."
839862 842799 It's that time of night again.
842823 843467 Time...
843491 845928 If that's what<br />the doctor ordered, I...
845952 848328 Oh, yeah. Yeah.<br />That's what the doctor ordered.
862260 863843 Do you...
949055 950282 Mum!
950306 952117 - It's in my room!<br />- What is?
952141 953910 - The Babadook!<br />- Oh, no.
953934 958624 No, no, no.<br />This is not going to happen.
958648 961376 The closet doors were closed<br />and now they're wide open.
961400 963378 It's just a book.
963402 965756 It can't hurt you.
965780 968508 You've had a big day.
968532 971159 You're just exhausted.
972411 975914 I don't want anything bad<br />to happen to you, Mum.
978125 981605 Nothing bad's going to happen,<br />Sam.
981629 984172 I'm gonna protect you.
1054326 1056995 Mum, it's 9:00.
1068090 1070193 He's not running a fever<br />anymore.
1070217 1074573 No, no, no. My sister's gonna<br />take him. Put it back!
1074597 1076431 Put it back<br />or it goes in the bin.
1077683 1079661 Sorry. What was that?
1079685 1083206 Oh, no. I couldn't get to<br />the phone. He was vomiting.
1083230 1086084 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />No worries. I'll see you soon.
1086108 1089485 Samuel, no monster talk<br />at Aunty Claire's, OK?
1090696 1094741 Samuel - no Babadook.<br />No nothing. Alright?
1102500 1105103 88. Number 88.
1105127 1107022 Two fat ladies.
1107046 1108648 Good, Elaine!
1108672 1111299 Another few days and someone<br />could call out, "Bingo!"
1114804 1116114 Number 11.
1116138 1117866 Who has number 11?
1117890 1119951 Legs 11.
1119975 1122810 Hey? See what else we've got.
1125147 1127125 5 billion.
1127149 1129567 Anyone got 5 billion?
1140663 1143414 Beverley's not very impressed<br />with your bingo skills.
1146544 1149105 - Are you alright?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
1149129 1151858 No, I'm fine. How are you?<br />How's D wing?
1151882 1155093 Fine. Yeah.<br />Just a bunch of old people.
1157721 1160575 You don't have to be fine,<br />you know.
1160599 1163995 Just a bit stressed<br />at the moment.
1164019 1165853 Why don't you go home?
1166981 1170418 Old cranky bitch -<br />she goes after lunch.
1170442 1171336 I can cover for you.
1171360 1173987 - You'd do that?<br />- Yeah.
1175739 1177676 I'll give you my pay.
1177700 1179594 Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.
1179618 1181888 You've got a sick boy.
1181912 1183765 Life's too short.
1183789 1186666 You're so sweet, Robbie.
1187877 1190188 - You should go.<br />- Yeah.
1190212 1193423 - Say hi to Sam for me.<br />- I will.
1244141 1247579 Where have you been?<br />You weren't at work.
1247603 1248830 Rung you a million times.
1248854 1249873 What happened?
1249897 1251958 Just scared the crap<br />out of Ruby. That's all.
1251982 1255128 He insisted on talking to this<br />bloody Babadook thing all day.
1255152 1257380 Just talking to the air -<br />even freaked me out.
1257404 1258423 I'm so sorry.
1258447 1259883 You need to get him<br />to see someone, Amelia.
1259907 1261801 It's not normal for a kid<br />to carry on with this rubbish.
1261825 1263261 It's not rubbish. It's real!
1263285 1265411 Don't you talk to<br />your Aunty Claire like that.
1268123 1269809 Where did you get<br />those firecrackers?
1269833 1271728 You got them for me<br />on the internet.
1271752 1273253 Well,<br />that's the end of the internet.
1275506 1278360 If the Babadook was real, we'd<br />see it right now, wouldn't we?
1278384 1281988 It wants to scare you first<br />then you'll see it.
1282012 1283823 Well, I'm not scared.
1283847 1286952 You will be when it creeps<br />into your room at night.
1286976 1288620 That's enough.
1288644 1291206 You will be<br />when it eats your insides.
1291230 1292040 I've decided
1292064 1293917 you're not having your birthday<br />with Ruby this week.
1293941 1295650 No cake, no games.<br />That's the end of it.
1300322 1301864 Samuel.
1311291 1315355 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />Mum and Dad,
1315379 1318024 life is not always as it seems.
1318048 1321277 It can be a wondrous thing.
1321301 1325721 But it can also be<br />very treacherous.
1333772 1337085 Don't worry, Dad. I'll save Mum.
1337109 1340111 I'm gonna trap<br />the Babadook like this.
1343032 1346219 And when it's trapped,<br />I'm gonna kill it.
1346243 1348327 Samuel.
1357671 1359524 I was just<br />putting something back.
1359548 1360942 All your father's things<br />are down there.
1360966 1361985 He's my father.
1362009 1364135 You don't own him!
1365846 1368097 Just thought I'd see<br />how you're going.
1371560 1372894 Can I come in?
1374229 1377333 Hey, matey. This is for you.
1377357 1380128 My mum always got me a model<br />plane when I was sick.
1380152 1381652 I'm not sick.
1383280 1387260 Oh. I-I thought... No,<br />he's not, actually.
1387284 1390346 The truth is he's so disobedient<br />he can't go to school anymore.
1390370 1391389 You said that's not true.
1391413 1392932 How many 6-year-old boys<br />do you know, Robbie,
1392956 1394100 who still believe in monsters?
1394124 1395268 I hate you!
1395292 1396811 She won't let me have<br />a birthday party
1396835 1399879 and she won't let me have a dad!
1473495 1474745 Don't eat it.
1487759 1489677 The Babadook did it, Mum.
1491346 1492907 Go and watch a DVD<br />and I'll make something else.
1492931 1494450 The Babadook did it!
1494474 1496244 Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.
1496268 1500999 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />girls and boys,
1501023 1506462 welcome to the great Martin's<br />DVD 'School of Magic'.
1506486 1509549 Life is not always as it seems.
1509573 1513678 It can be a wondrous thing.
1513702 1517724 But it can also be<br />very treacherous.
1517748 1520059 In this DVD,
1520083 1524689 you will learn magic tricks<br />to surprise, to delight
1524713 1530343 and perhaps even shock<br />your family and friends.
1553742 1555493 Do you think this is funny?
1556870 1559789 Oh, no. No. No!
1561833 1563501 Give it to me!
1565045 1567713 Do you wanna die?
1640203 1642765 Don't let it in!<br />Don't let it in!
1642789 1646477 Don't let it in! Don't<br />let it in! Don't let it in!
1646501 1648294 Don't let it in!
1719157 1722576 Mum, do we have to<br />go to Ruby's party?
1732963 1735483 I've already got this doll, Mum.
1735507 1736818 Now she's got a twin.
1736842 1738093 They can go shopping together.
1742639 1745284 Off you go.
1745308 1747685 He's just really tired.
1752524 1755025 Go and play right now.
1761533 1764178 Claire tells me you're a writer.
1764202 1766889 Oh, no, not really. Not anymore.
1766913 1769392 What kind of writing did you do?
1769416 1773354 I wrote some articles for some<br />magazines, did some kids' stuff.
1773378 1775773 You just need to get<br />back into it. That's all.
1775797 1777233 It must be difficult.
1777257 1780695 I do volunteer work<br />with some disadvantaged women
1780719 1783448 and a few of them<br />have lost their husbands
1783472 1786140 and they find it very hard.
1788018 1789662 How's Richard's merger going?
1789686 1793916 Oh, good. I mean,<br />his workload's just ballooned.
1793940 1796711 I've got the kids 24/7,<br />it feels like.
1796735 1797879 Tell me about it!
1797903 1800214 I don't even have time to go to the gym<br />anymore. It's ridiculous!
1800238 1801841 That's a real tragedy.
1801865 1805178 Not having time to go to the gym<br />anymore. How do you cope?
1805202 1807263 You must have so much<br />to talk about
1807287 1808954 with those poor<br />disadvantaged women.
1820383 1824071 This is my tree house.<br />You're not allowed in here.
1824095 1825554 I'm not hurting anybody.
1828099 1829934 Bye.
1831895 1833938 - Thanks.<br />- Thanks.
1839903 1841839 How would your mum know<br />if it's real or not?
1841863 1843883 She never comes to our house.
1843907 1846385 Mum told Dad she didn't want<br />to go to your house
1846409 1848262 'cause it's too depressing.
1848286 1851265 The Babadook would eat your mum<br />for breakfast.
1851289 1853809 - It'd rip her arms off.<br />- Shut up!
1853833 1857021 They feel sorry for me, Claire.<br />There's a big difference.
1857045 1859440 God, Amelia, as soon as anyone<br />mentions Oskar, you can't cope.
1859464 1862026 - That's not true.<br />- It'll be seven years.
1862050 1863486 Isn't it time you moved on?
1863510 1865029 I have moved on.
1865053 1868491 I don't mention him.<br />I don't talk about him.
1868515 1870618 What strain is that on you,<br />Claire?
1870642 1873412 You're not even<br />good enough to have a dad.
1873436 1875456 Everyone else has one<br />and you don't.
1875480 1877124 I do have a dad!
1877148 1880002 I listen to your life<br />day in, day out,
1880026 1883089 and you never stop to ask me<br />anything about mine.
1883113 1884340 I do!
1884364 1886050 I want to know how you are.
1886074 1887760 You don't come round<br />to our house anymore.
1887784 1889971 Because I can't stand<br />being around your son.
1889995 1892598 I can't believe<br />you just said that.
1892622 1895142 You can't stand being around him<br />yourself.
1895166 1897645 Your dad died so he didn't<br />have to be with you.
1897669 1899146 That's not true!
1899170 1900356 And your mum doesn't want you.
1900380 1902715 No-one wants you.
1913810 1914996 What did you do?!
1915020 1917688 She said I didn't have a dad.<br />She kept saying it.
1919316 1920918 Is she alright?
1920942 1923546 Stay here<br />and look after the children
1923570 1925631 or do you want another one<br />to get hurt?
1925655 1930720 Mummy! She wouldn't believe me!
1930744 1933222 Mummy! Mummy!
1933246 1935141 Mummy!
1935165 1939168 - Mummy! Mummy!<br />- Why can't you just be normal?!
1940754 1943047 There is no Babadook!
1944799 1947051 Get out!
1949721 1952366 - Get out!<br />- Samuel?
1952390 1954619 - Mummy!<br />- Stop this now!
1954643 1957519 Get out! Get out! Get out!
1976706 1977933 Please help me!
1977957 1980125 There's something wrong<br />with my son.
1992013 1995201 I think it may have been<br />a febrile convulsion.
1995225 1997078 That's when the brain overheats.
1997102 1998412 It always looks worse<br />than it is.
1998436 2000289 I've never seen<br />anything like this.
2000313 2002375 We'll have to wait<br />until the tests come back.
2002399 2004168 All his other results<br />are normal.
2004192 2008339 He's obviously suffering<br />a high level of anxiety.
2008363 2010091 Very committed to<br />the monster theory.
2010115 2011490 That's an understatement.
2012617 2015221 All children see monsters.
2015245 2016995 Not like this.
2018331 2020393 And it's getting worse.
2020417 2023104 He's becoming aggressive.
2023128 2024689 He could see a psychiatrist.
2024713 2026315 I can refer you.
2026339 2027900 Takes a few weeks to get in.
2027924 2029133 That'd be great.
2031052 2034365 But can you just give me<br />something for now,
2034389 2036849 just to make him sleep?
2037976 2039601 Um, just until...
2040895 2043063 just until<br />we get an appointment.
2044274 2046419 Please?
2046443 2051215 I haven't slept in weeks<br />and neither has Samuel
2051239 2052633 and when we go home tonight,
2052657 2054635 this whole nightmare<br />will start up again
2054659 2058787 and I am really... I'm<br />really not coping.
2061040 2065646 I can give you<br />a short course of sedatives.
2065670 2068065 Just until the tests come back.
2068089 2072945 Most mothers aren't too keen<br />on them unless it's really bad.
2072969 2074970 It's really bad.
2082187 2086751 These can make children<br />feel foggy.
2086775 2089003 Perhaps some temporary nausea.
2089027 2092214 They'll certainly<br />help him sleep, though.
2092238 2095824 - That's for one week.<br />- Thank you.
2097952 2100306 Why don't people like me?
2100330 2102391 Why do you say that?
2102415 2106335 Ruby said people don't like me<br />'cause I'm weird.
2107587 2111548 Sometimes people say things<br />that aren't true.
2115136 2119200 You just need to take<br />your medicine, have a big sleep
2119224 2120599 and not worry.
2122101 2123871 I don't want you to die.
2123895 2126999 I'm not gonna die<br />for a long time yet.
2127023 2131276 Did you think that about my dad<br />before he died?
2135406 2139011 Just take your pill<br />so you can go to sleep.
2139035 2141347 I've got the day off tomorrow.
2141371 2143390 Maybe we could do something,
2143414 2146769 Will these make<br />the Babadook go away?
2146793 2148479 I think so
2148503 2150356 but you have to promise me<br />not to mention it again.
2150380 2154401 I promise to protect you<br />if you promise to protect me.
2154425 2156237 Then I won't mention it.
2156261 2160574 I promise to protect you.
2160598 2162307 Come on.
2173570 2174736 Come on.
2181244 2183722 Can you stay here with me?
2183746 2185641 Yes.
2185665 2187977 I love you, Mum.
2188001 2189793 Me too.
2372185 2374496 Her nose<br />is broken in two places.
2374520 2375330 She may need surgery.
2375354 2376707 I'll pay for everything.
2376731 2378459 You can't even pay<br />your own bills.
2378483 2379835 Look, I really have to go.
2379859 2383630 Claire, I think someone<br />is stalking me and Samuel.
2383654 2385007 What?
2385031 2387051 A book turned up at our place.
2387075 2390679 I threw it away but somebody<br />glued it back together
2390703 2392473 and put it on our doorstep.
2392497 2395893 Amelia,<br />I just can't help you right now.
2395917 2398854 I don't expect you to help.<br />I just wanted...
2398878 2401106 If you're that worried,<br />you should go to the police.
2401130 2403965 I have to go.
2422693 2424402 Claire!
2426280 2427656 Hello?
2429325 2437325 Mmm, Babadook... dook... dook.
2444340 2447236 Hi.
2447260 2451198 I want to report someone<br />stalking me and my child.
2451222 2452533 Can you tell us what happened?
2452557 2455517 Somebody sent me<br />a children's book.
2457228 2459581 And?
2459605 2462751 And it contained violent<br />and graphic images
2462775 2464795 of my child and me<br />being murdered.
2464819 2466797 Can we have a look at the book,<br />please?
2466821 2469049 I burnt it.
2469073 2471760 You burnt it?
2471784 2472886 Yes.
2472910 2475412 Well, unfortunately, there's<br />nothing we can do about it.
2477248 2481061 He's been making phone calls<br />to me as well.
2481085 2482354 What's he been saying?
2482378 2486024 Nothing,<br />just making these... noises.
2486048 2487860 How do you know<br />it's the same person?
2487884 2490320 Because of what<br />he wrote in the book.
2490344 2492072 The book you burnt?
2492096 2494264 Yes.
2510615 2511740 OK.
2513326 2515327 Don't worry about it.
2525004 2527107 Did you get your things done?
2527131 2529276 Mrs Roach has Parkinson's.
2529300 2531069 That's why she shakes like this.
2531093 2532821 Samuel, you don't have to<br />say everything
2532845 2534072 that goes through your head.
2534096 2536658 Oh, it's alright, love.
2536682 2541663 He wanted to know<br />so we talked about it.
2541687 2544333 He sees things as they are,<br />that one.
2544357 2546043 Oskar was the same.
2546067 2547753 He always spoke his mind.
2547777 2550654 Do you have to<br />keep on bringing him up?
2556661 2558138 Hey, Bugsy.
2558162 2561183 Hey.
2561207 2563583 Hey!
2578683 2580433 Eugh!
2629400 2631651 Don't come in here.
2644081 2646476 I don't want to buy anything.
2646500 2648562 Are you Amelia Vanick?
2648586 2649604 Yes.
2649628 2652190 I'm Warren Newton<br />and this is Prue Flannery
2652214 2653984 from the Department of<br />Community Services.
2654008 2656028 My son's only been<br />away for two days.
2656052 2659573 He's not actually registered<br />at Babbage Bay anymore.
2659597 2661783 If I could just come in<br />and meet Samuel
2661807 2663976 and get you to look at<br />these papers, that'd be great.
2664977 2668457 I'm just in the middle<br />of cleaning up the house
2668481 2670042 at the moment.
2670066 2674027 I'm sorry.<br />There's stuff everywhere.
2676655 2679009 Hello, Samuel.
2679033 2683036 I'm Prue and this is Warren.
2684538 2686058 How are you?
2686082 2689770 I'm a bit tired from the drugs<br />Mum gave me.
2689794 2693857 Not drugs. Tranquillisers...<br />from the doctor.
2693881 2695734 He had a fit yesterday.
2695758 2699154 I'm really tired, actually.
2699178 2700887 That's no good.
2703766 2705911 May I have a glass of water,<br />please?
2705935 2710271 Yes. Of course. I'll get you one.
2717154 2719132 It's a real mess.
2719156 2721551 I just found<br />this cockroach infestation.
2721575 2723095 I normally have<br />the house sprayed.
2723119 2724971 I did actually already<br />have it sprayed
2724995 2727808 but there's this hole<br />in the wall behind the fridge
2727832 2729499 and that's why I...
2734338 2736983 I didn't mean<br />a hole in the wall.
2737007 2739486 There was a hole<br />in the wallpaper.
2739510 2741780 That's where they were<br />laying their eggs, I think.
2741804 2743972 We've caught you at a bad time.
2745266 2746952 I'll leave you with this.
2746976 2749579 We're required<br />to come back in a week
2749603 2751373 to talk through your options.
2751397 2753606 Here's my card.
2754859 2759571 Mum, I think I'm gonna vomit.
2779091 2781611 What was that noise I heard?
2781635 2784489 I didn't hear any noise.
2784513 2786783 Wind howling, doors slamming.
2786807 2789767 I declare, I think this house<br />is haunted.
2790311 2794040 Mum, I'm gonna go to bed.
2794064 2796042 Are you sick?
2796066 2797358 Oh, no, Granny.
2798986 2801047 It's only 6:00.
2801071 2803800 Don't you want to stay up<br />with your mum for a while?
2803824 2805260 No.
2805284 2808328 If you go to bed now,<br />the pills won't work properly.
2811790 2815501 You have to stay up for a while,<br />sweetheart.
2830392 2832454 Where's its mother, Skip?
2832478 2834039 Koalas don't leave<br />their babies about.
2834063 2836082 Are you off now, Dad?
2836106 2837792 Yep. Soon as I fuel up.
2837816 2839753 Tell Jerry I'll keep in touch<br />on the radio
2839777 2842112 and I'll be back before breakfast<br />the day after tomorrow.
2843531 2845800 "And the Prince and the Princess"
2845824 2848762 "lived happily together<br />in a beautiful palace"
2848786 2851287 "for the rest of their days."
2954016 2961731 Babadook... dook... dook.
2996100 2998662 What are we doing?
2998686 3000497 We're going downstairs.
3000521 3002897 - Why?<br />- Because we are.
3021709 3024646 Iris, Iris, Iris.
3024670 3026504 No.
3076096 3077907 Glass and mirror attachment.
3077931 3079909 Clean and polish<br />shower doors or mirrors
3079933 3081453 for a streak-free shine.
3081477 3082829 As part of<br />your steaming special,
3082853 3084664 we'll even include<br />the garment and upholst...
3084688 3088191 Oh, I don't want to give it<br />to anyone at work.
3089943 3092964 Alright.<br />Give all my shifts away.
3092988 3094322 That's just what I need.
3096241 3097594 I can't help it if I'm sick.
3097618 3099035 What do you expect me to do?
3100245 3101829 You do that!
3116303 3121057 Mum, I took the pills<br />but I feel sick again.
3122768 3125519 I need to eat something.
3129650 3133361 I couldn't find any food<br />in the fridge.
3135155 3138426 You said to have them with food.
3138450 3142388 I'm really hungry, Mum.
3142412 3146518 Why do you have to keep talk,<br />talk, talking?
3146542 3148478 Don't you ever stop?
3148502 3152106 - I was just...<br />- I need to sleep!
3152130 3155610 I'm sorry, Mummy.<br />I was just really hungry.
3155634 3159887 If you're that hungry,<br />why don't you go and eat shit?
3193422 3195066 I'm so sorry.
3195090 3198259 I don't know why I said that.<br />It was terrible.
3199511 3203116 I've had absolutely no sleep.
3203140 3205516 I didn't know what I was saying.
3207311 3209270 I'll cook you something. Hey?
3210606 3211916 What would you like?
3211940 3213899 I'm not hungry anymore.
3220949 3222844 We really need to get<br />out of this house.
3222868 3225328 We've been cooped up here<br />too long. That's the problem.
3230167 3232043 Do you want to go to Wally's?
3233170 3235690 You can have anything you want.<br />Alright?
3235714 3239425 Even ice-cream for breakfast<br />if you like.
3241803 3244949 Give it back!
3244973 3249037 - Stop it! Sit down. Sit down.<br />- No!
3249061 3250997 - Now!<br />- Give my drink back!
3251021 3252438 Sit down, please.
3258654 3259881 Where are we going?
3259905 3262990 I just want to drive<br />for a little while.
3274711 3277023 Aarggh!
3277047 3279048 Mummy! Mummy!
3281426 3283636 Babadook.
3294940 3295959 You ran straight into me!
3295983 3300361 I just bought this bloody car.<br />What were you thinking?
3301655 3304217 Oh, driving on the wrong side of<br />the road with a kid in the back.
3304241 3306177 You could've killed someone!
3306201 3308930 Hey!
3308954 3309973 Hey, what are you doing?
3309997 3311956 Hey! Crazy bitch!
3318714 3321132 Hi, sweetheart.
3329224 3330850 Mum?
3332310 3334770 I can call Aunty Claire.
3337691 3340734 I can call<br />and she can come over.
3344156 3345591 Mum?
3345615 3350202 Aunty Claire doesn't want<br />to talk to us anymore.
3351747 3354957 Mum. Mum, look at me.
3381151 3383819 It's nice and warm in here.
3387365 3389575 I don't want you to go away.
3391745 3393954 I'm not going anywhere.
3406343 3407760 Mum?
3415393 3419647 Mum, I don't think<br />we should stay here tonight.
3420982 3423127 I can call Mrs Roach.
3423151 3426987 I don't want you to call anyone.
3429908 3432451 I just need to sleep.
3436623 3438749 - Mum...<br />- Leave it!
3470115 3472157 There's something in the house.
3486798 3488716 There's someone in the house!
3544064 3545750 Mrs Roach...
3545774 3547858 can we come and stay the night?
3557285 3559263 Gracie, I'm so sorry.
3559287 3561682 Has someone<br />broken into the house?
3561706 3564769 - Sam said that...<br />- No, no, no. We're fine.
3564793 3566687 Samuel's just being<br />very disobedient again.
3566711 3568981 Oh, I was so worried.
3569005 3570524 I told him not to call anyone.
3570548 3572443 He asked<br />if you could stay the night.
3572467 3575279 No, no, no. We're fine. I just<br />have a headache. That's all.
3575303 3577304 I really have to go, though,<br />now, Gracie.
3578848 3580409 I'm so sorry for troubling you.
3580433 3581994 Yes. Talk soon.
3582018 3583560 No worries. Talk soon.
3586147 3588668 I told you not to call anyone
3588692 3590651 and you deliberately<br />disobeyed me.
3591820 3594006 Do you want to frighten<br />Mrs Roach?
3594030 3596217 An old lady who can hardly walk?
3596241 3597783 Do you want to make her sick?
3599661 3601829 Get that bloody thing off!
3605959 3611065 Is this the only way I can trust<br />you not to embarrass me
3611089 3612589 in front of our neighbours?
3617304 3618887 Is this what I have to do?
3630525 3631669 I'm sorry, Mummy.
3631693 3633921 It's just that the Babadook made<br />you crash the car and then...
3633945 3635923 What'd you say?
3635947 3637591 I said the Babadook...
3637615 3639218 The Babadook isn't real, Samuel.
3639242 3643055 He's just something you've made up<br />in your stupid little head.
3643079 3645599 I just didn't want you<br />to let it in!
3645623 3649312 I'll make sure nothing<br />gets in tonight.
3649336 3650896 Alright, Samuel?
3650920 3653441 Nothing is coming in here<br />tonight.
3653465 3655007 Nothing!
3692212 3694648 I feel sick.
3694672 3699028 If you don't take the pill,<br />you'll feel worse.
3699052 3700654 Mum, I don't think I need...
3700678 3703722 I am the parent and you are<br />the child so take the pill.
3727205 3729414 Good boy.
3752105 3753438 Mum!
3770623 3774167 Hey, Bugsy. Hey, sweetie.
3776337 3778714 Come here, sweetie. Hey?
3779966 3781258 Hey.
3782427 3783969 Hey!
3804908 3806617 Here we go.
3812499 3814666 There's more<br />where that came from.
3831059 3833245 Aarggh!
3833269 3834519 What's the secret?
3837106 3838792 Letter of Max's, didn't you?
3838816 3840336 No, not for a minute.
3840360 3842213 Don't lie.<br />You called me a Jezebel. Why?
3842237 3844423 - The north, east.<br />- Natural corset.
3844447 3845906 With fresh meat.
3848243 3851138 Only five...
3851162 3853580 You don't wanna go<br />in there all by yourself, do you?
3855458 3857853 Police say the woman<br />used a kitchen knife
3857877 3859438 to stab her son.
3859462 3861607 His body was found<br />in their basement.
3861631 3864360 The woman later attacked<br />officers with a knife.
3864384 3868614 They drew their guns<br />and shot her to death.
3868638 3870574 Little is known about the tragedy
3870598 3874537 but neighbours say the boy was<br />celebrating his birthday today.
3874561 3876979 He had just turned seven.
3891369 3892953 Samuel?
3897250 3898792 Wake up, Mummy.
3901754 3905007 But you're the one who's asleep,<br />sweetheart.
3910555 3912305 Don't go down there.
3917020 3918729 It's not safe.
3955600 3958769 Ohh... I thought you were dead.
3959896 3962439 I thought you were dead.
3976913 3978955 We're gonna be together.
3981584 3983960 You just need to bring me<br />the boy.
4006359 4008837 You mean Samuel?
4008861 4011154 You can bring me the boy.
4013825 4015408 You can bring me the boy.
4017495 4019056 You can bring me the boy.
4019080 4020474 Stop calling him 'the boy'.
4020498 4022685 I think it's going to rain.
4022709 4024126 No.
4116052 4119179 It isn't real. It isn't real.<br />It isn't real.
4131359 4133568 Oh, no.
4139075 4140909 No! No!
4148960 4150460 Bugsy!
4262239 4263990 Samuel!
4269372 4270914 Samuel.
4272708 4276920 Bugsy's hurt<br />and we need to get help.
4279507 4281966 You don't want him to die,<br />do you?
4285972 4287741 Samuel.
4287765 4290809 Are you listening to me?
4294730 4297167 Let me in, you little shit!
4297191 4299628 Let me in!
4299652 4300921 Let me in!
4300945 4302464 Let me in!
4302488 4305448 Let me in!
4327763 4329992 You little pig!
4330016 4333829 Six years old and you're still<br />wetting yourself.
4333853 4335998 You don't know how many times
4336022 4339918 I wished it was you, not him,<br />that died.
4339942 4341670 I just want you to be happy.
4341694 4344821 "I just want you to be happy."
4348159 4349678 Sometimes...
4349702 4353515 I just wanna smash<br />your head against a brick wall
4353539 4356768 until your fucking brains<br />pop out.
4356792 4358854 You're not my mother.
4358878 4360439 What did you say?
4360463 4363066 I said you're not my mother!
4363090 4366634 I am your mother!
4368512 4372265 Run, run, run,<br />as fast as you can!
4375644 4376997 Get away!
4377021 4378938 Didn't I tell you<br />not to play with weapons?
4427947 4430926 I'm sorry, love. I know it's late.
4430950 4433095 I just wanted to make sure<br />you were OK.
4433119 4436098 I'm OK.
4436122 4442020 I know... this time of year's<br />terribly hard for you.
4442044 4446316 And I know you don't want me<br />to go on about it, so I won't.
4446340 4448443 But I just wanted you to know
4448467 4451530 that I'd do anything<br />for you and Sam.
4451554 4453596 I love you both.
4456892 4458643 Samuel.
4461522 4463189 I'm sorry.
4466110 4468004 I understand you're scared.
4468028 4472008 I haven't been good<br />since your dad died.
4472032 4475118 I haven't been good at all.
4477913 4481416 I'm sick, Sam. I need help.
4485671 4488423 I just spoke with Mrs Roach.
4491302 4493780 We're going to<br />stay there tonight.
4493804 4496723 Do you want that?
4501187 4504272 I want to make it up to you,<br />Sam.
4515409 4517452 I want you to meet your dad.
4519246 4521789 It's beautiful there.
4523417 4526002 You'll be happy.
4532635 4534302 Sorry, Mummy!
4582768 4584871 Mum!
4584895 4587540 Mum!
4587564 4589774 I'm not leaving you.
4592695 4595613 Mum? Mum?
4602538 4605498 You said<br />we'd protect each other.
4611297 4613631 I know you don't love me.
4615050 4617279 The Babadook won't let you.
4617303 4619637 But I love you, Mum.
4621056 4623433 And I always will.
4632943 4637113 You let it in.<br />You have to get it out!
4641201 4644014 I don't want you to go away.
4644038 4645598 No! No! No!
4645622 4647790 Mummy!
4697883 4699361 Mummy!
4699385 4701446 Mummy!
4701470 4703406 Mummy!
4703430 4705867 Mummy! Mummy!
4705891 4708036 Mummy!
4708060 4709644 Mummy!
4747516 4748910 What is it?
4748934 4750768 You can't get rid of<br />the Babadook.
4781300 4782508 What do you want?
4786096 4787847 What do you want?
4825719 4827447 No.
4827471 4830473 Keep breathing.
4833727 4836896 Put your seat back, sweetheart.<br />10 more minutes and we're there.
4841276 4843319 No.
4848116 4849511 I think it's gonna rain.
4849535 4851535 Stop!
4899751 4902003 You are nothing.
4914349 4915725 You're nothing!
4925152 4927695 This is my house!
4931742 4935202 You are trespassing in my house!
4944838 4949675 If you touch my son again<br />I'll fucking kill you!
4958435 4960603 No!
5004398 5005606 Mummy, don't!
5011780 5013864 Don't!
5119971 5122533 Watch out for your mum's leg,<br />little one.
5122557 5124535 He's fine.<br />I've had the stitches out.
5124559 5126370 What time's the party?
5126394 5127705 Any time after three is fine.
5127729 5129624 I'll see you in a few hours, then.
5129648 5131209 Bye.
5131233 5133002 Bye, Sam.
5133026 5135379 That school's a good choice.
5135403 5137548 I've been doing<br />a lot of reading about it
5137572 5139258 so I think<br />Sam will be happy there.
5139282 5140968 He's been out of school<br />over two weeks now.
5140992 5143012 It's time to get back.
5143036 5146455 We needed some time<br />to sort a few things out.
5147791 5149602 Are you having a party?
5149626 5151354 It's Sam's birthday today.
5151378 5154690 My first birthday<br />I've ever celebrated.
5154714 5156192 That's not true.
5156216 5158820 Yes, it is.<br />My first party on the day.
5158844 5161136 That's unusual.
5163557 5166953 My husband died the day<br />that Sam was born.
5166977 5170229 He got killed driving Mum<br />to the hospital to have me.
5172357 5174418 Sam's just like his dad was.
5174442 5176546 Always speaks his mind.
5176570 5180883 Well, parties are lots of fun,<br />especially when they're yours.
5180907 5185703 My cousin's not coming because<br />I broke her nose in two places.
5188081 5190082 I'll take that for you.
5209603 5210955 Good shot.
5210979 5213249 Look, there's another one!
5213273 5215357 Where's your bowl?
5218320 5221530 Wow. You've got a lot today.
5223116 5225177 Am I ever gonna see it?
5225201 5228620 One day, when you're bigger.
5234336 5238464 You go outside, and you don't<br />come in until I tell you.
5283093 5285279 It's alright.
5285303 5286989 It's alright.
5287013 5289056 It's alright.
5323508 5325194 How was it?
5325218 5327719 It was pretty quiet today.
5329764 5331348 Come here.
5335520 5337938 It's getting much better, Mum.
5341818 5343170 Wait!
5343194 5345320 I have a new trick.
5348783 5351762 Life is not always as it seems.
5351786 5354746 Nothing in my hands.<br />Nothing in my hands.
5359919 5362796 - That's great!<br />- I haven't finished.
5372307 5375517 Abracadabra!
5378021 5379813 How did you do that?
5385111 5386881 Come here, you.
5386905 5388113 Come here.
5398583 5401168 Happy birthday, sweetheart.
