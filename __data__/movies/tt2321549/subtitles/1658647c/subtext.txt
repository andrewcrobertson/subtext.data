331190 333000 Just a few years before you end up there isn't it?
334170 334920 Right?
340660 343180 Amelia, your son's school is on the phone
348460 349650 Oh my God
350030 351069 Did he hurt anyone?
351070 353900 A dart could have gone into a child's eye or even worse
355250 356700 I'm gonna have a serious talk with him
357000 358810 Mrs Fanning we had the talks
359220 360930 We had decisions with the counselor
361260 362930 We're going to have to employ
363240 364930 a monitor for him
365250 366070 A monitor?
366250 368269 He'll be separated from the other children
368270 370920 The monitor will supervise him one on one
371400 374250 Sammy wont cope with this he already feels so different
374680 376249 I'll have a talk with him
376250 377359 I'll have a serious talk
377360 381030 Mrs Fanning the boy has significant behavioral problems
381590 384769 You know, Sammy doesn't need a full time monitor
384770 386769 what he needs is some understanding
386770 389320 I have 24 other first graders in that class
389580 391879 Do you want me to put them all on risk because of your son?
391880 393580 I think I'll just find another school
393880 395989 ,Mrs Fanning you can't just take the boy out of school
395990 398299 You'll look after your business and I'll go find a school
398300 399949 that sees my son as a human being
399950 401850 and not just as another problem to be gotten rid of
401880 404620 That's very unfair we're only trying to help the boy
404720 405220 Please
405610 407110 Stop calling him "the boy"
407890 409110 He's name's Samuel
416540 419070 We can see Ruby and auntie Claire at the park today
420440 423730 You can play in that swing you<br />like for as long as you like ok?

1781670 1784149 I don't even have time to go to<br />the gym anymore it's ridiculous
1784150 1786150 That's a real tragedy!
1786950 1789900 Not having time to go to the gym anymore. How do you cope?!
1790230 1793770 You must have so much to talk about<br />with those poor disadvantaged women
1805420 1808419 This is my tree house your not allowed in here
1808420 1810420 I'm not hurting anybody!
1812680 1813200 Bye
1816100 1816810 Thanks
1817280 1818300 Thanks
1824070 1826150 How your mum know if it's real or not
1826320 1828109 She never comes to our house!
1828110 1832479 Mum told dad she didn't want to go to<br />your house because is too depressing!
1832480 1835749 The babadook would eat your mum for breakfast
1835750 1837419 And then rip her arms off!
1837420 1838049 Shut up!
1838050 1840449 They feel sorry for me Claire there's a big difference
1840450 1843779 God Amelia as soon anyone mentions Oscar you can't cope!
1843780 1844529 That's not true
1844530 1846010 It will be 7 years!
1846390 1847699 Isn't it time you moved on?
1847700 1849210 I have moved on!
1849920 1851210 When do I mention him?
1851260 1852639 When I talk about him?
1852640 1854760 What strain is that on you Claire?
1854810 1857480 You're not even good enough to have a dad!
1857620 1859919 Everyone else has one you don't!
1859920 1861279 I do have a dad!
1861280 1864389 I listen to your life day in day out
1864390 1867569 And you never stopped asking anything about mine
1867570 1868270 I do!
1868700 1870269 I want to know how you are!
1870270 1871649 You're not coming around the house anymore!
1871650 1874550 Because I can't stand being around your son!
1875070 1876550 I can't believe you just say that
1876870 1879129 You can't stand being around him yourself!
1879130 1881839 Your dad died so he didn't have to be with you
1881840 1883060 That's not true!
1883180 1885060 Your mum doesn't want you
1885600 1886860 No one wants you
1898090 1899339 What did you do!
1899340 1902220 She said I didn't have a dad! She kept saying it!
1904250 1905250 Is she all right?
1906000 1909570 Stay here and look after the children<br />or do you want another one to get hurt?
1910830 1914120 Mummy! She won't believe me!
1914710 1916120 Mommy!
1916390 1917460 Mommy!
1917730 1919140 Mommy!
1919480 1920340 Mommy!
1920970 1923420 Why can't you just be normal?!
1925200 1927420 There is no babadook!
1930380 1931720 Get out!
1934320 1935359 Get out!
1935360 1936160 Samuel?
1936590 1937569 Mommy!
1937570 1939569 Stop please now!<br />- Get out!
1939570 1941570 Get out! Get out!
1960830 1962340 Please help me!
1962580 1964340 There's something wrong with my son!
1976930 1979340 Nothing more than a febrile convulsion
1979530 1981339 It's when the brain hardly heats
1981340 1982639 It always looks worst than it is
1982640 1984370 But I've never seen anything like this!
1984420 1986469 We have to wait until the tests come back
1986470 1988470 all these other results are normal
1988900 1992200 He's obviously suffering a high level of anxiety
1992740 1994409 Very committed to the monster theory
1994410 1996040 Yet an understatement
1997790 1999610 All children see monsters
1999860 2001010 Not like this!
2003520 2004390 And it's getting worse
2005340 2006900 He's becoming aggressive
2007360 2008900 He could see a psychiatrist
2009200 2010320 I can refer you
2010880 2012129 Takes a few weeks to get in
2012130 2013050 That'd be great
2015260 2016599 But can you...
2016600 2018910 Just give me something for now, just...
2019770 2020910 To make him sleep?
2022320 2023800 And just until...
2025090 2027730 Just until we get an appointment....
2029410 2030470 Please!
2031510 2033820 I haven't slept in weeks and...
2034150 2035819 Neither has Samuel…
2035820 2039840 And when we go home tonight this whole nightmare<br />will start up again and I am really...
2041310 2043410 I'm really not coping
2046210 2047210 I can...
2047690 2050070 I can give you a short course of sedatives
2050180 2052070 Just until the tests come back
2053060 2054650 Less the mothers
2054840 2057500 are too keen on them unless it's really bad
2057700 2058990 It's really bad
2066930 2069760 These can make children feel
2070360 2071130 Foggy
2071510 2073450 Perhaps in temporary nausea
2074060 2076140 but certainly help him sleep back
2077680 2078619 That's for one week
2078620 2079780 Thank you
2082630 2084620 Why don't people like me
2085020 2086620 Why do you say that?
2086750 2090100 Ruby said people don't like me because I'm weird
2092760 2095940 Sometime people say things that aren't true
2100150 2102150 You just need to take your medicine
2102230 2104150 Have a big sleep and not worrying
2106190 2108150 I don't want you to die
2108450 2111340 I'm not gonna die for a long time yet
2111750 2115550 Did you think that about my dad before he died?
2119860 2122550 Just take your pill so you can go to sleep
2124520 2127460 I've got the day off tomorrow, maybe we can do something uh?
2128390 2130990 Will these make the babadook go away?
2131530 2134770 I think so but you have to promise<br />me not to mention it again
2135270 2138820 I promise to protect you if you promise to protect me
2139230 2140820 Then I wont mention it
2141400 2142819 I promise
2142820 2144080 To protect you
2144620 2146080 C'mon
2158870 2159460 C'mon
2165880 2167720 Can you stay here with me?
2169140 2170420 Yes
2171240 2172420 I love you mum
2172960 2174420 Me too
2356780 2359619 The nose is broken in two places and then the surgery
2359620 2360840 I'll pay for everything
2360940 2362840 You can't even pay your own bills!
2362950 2364100 Look I really have to go
2364160 2367670 Claire... I think somebody is stalking me and Samuel
2367890 2368930 What?!
2369630 2372000 A book ended at our place
2372320 2376410 I threw it away but somebody glued it<br />back together and put it on our door step
2376570 2377580 Amelia
2378660 2380329 I just can't help you right now
2380330 2382710 I don't expect you to help I just wanted
2382720 2384600 If it's that urgent you should go to the police
2385830 2387320 I have to go
2406620 2407530 Claire!
2410670 2411800 Hello?
2414550 2416440 BA-BAA
2416600 2417940 DOOK
2418120 2419740 DOOK
2419810 2421740 DOOK!
2429440 2430190 Hi
2431740 2434800 I want to report someone stalking me and my child
2435170 2436799 Can you tell us what happened?
2436800 2437670 Somebody sent me
2438560 2439670 A children's book
2442780 2443560 And?
2444900 2448890 And it contained violent and graphic<br />images of my child and me being murdered
2449340 2450890 Can we have a look at the book please?
2451660 2452890 I burnt it
2454600 2455560 You burnt it
2455930 2456810 Yes
2457430 2459580 Well unfortunately there's nothing we can do about it
2462510 2464900 He's been making phone calls to me as well
2465020 2466130 What's he being saying?
2466340 2468600 Nothing he was just making this...
2469200 2470250 Noises...
2470550 2472249 How do you know is the same person?
2472250 2474250 Because of what he wrote in the book!
2474430 2476250 The book you burnt
2477700 2478250 Yes
2494580 2495790 Ok
2497550 2498750 Don't worry about it
2509800 2511479 Did you get your things hon?
2511480 2513479 Mrs Roach has Parkinson's
2513480 2515479 That's why she shakes like this!
2515480 2518160 Samuel you don't have to say<br />everything that goes to your head
2519900 2521340 It's all right love!
2521660 2523340 He wanted to know
2523990 2525340 So we talked about it
2525980 2528560 Sammy sees things as that they are that one
2528700 2530090 Oscar was the same
2530370 2532089 He always spoke his mind
2532090 2534090 Do you have to keep on bringing him up?
2541180 2542440 Hey Bugsy!
2544440 2545380 Hey!
2546580 2547380 Hey!
2614400 2615180 Don't come in here!

2635690 2638170 Prue Flanery from the department of community services
2638340 2640029 My son's only been away for two days!
2640030 2643800 He's not actually registered at Babidge bay anymore
2643980 2648070 If I could just come in and meet Samuel and get<br />you look at these papers that it'd be great
2650640 2653700 I'm just in the middle of cleaning<br />up the house at the moment
2655130 2658920 I'm sorry there's stuff everywhere

2705980 2709540 Normally I have the house sprayed and I<br />did actually already have it sprayed but
2710120 2713010 There's this hole in the wall behind<br />the fridge and that's why I...
2718250 2719820 I didn't mean...
2720160 2721370 Hole in the wall
2721830 2725940 There was a hole in the wall paper that's<br />where they were laying the insects I think

3576040 3577850 Do you wanna frighten Mrs Roach?
3578530 3581480 An old lady who can hardly walk. Do you wanna make her sick?
3584260 3585920 Get that bloody thing off!
3590630 3592639 Is this the only way
3592640 3596890 I can trust you not to embarrass<br />me in front of our neighbors?!
3601600 3603390 Is this what I have to do?
3614700 3615889 I'm sorry mommy
3615890 3619200 it's just that the babadook maybe crashed<br />the car engine -What did you say?
3620450 3621449 I said the babadook...
3621450 3623450 The babadook is not real Samuel
3623830 3625450 It's just something you made up
3625760 3627039 In your stupid little head
3627040 3629470 I just didn't want you to let it in!
3630090 3633449 I'll make sure nothing gets in tonight
3633450 3635030 All right Samuel?

5115410 5116640 Bye Sam!
5117640 5119290 That school is a good choice!
5119540 5121289 I've been doing a lot of reading about it
5121290 5123289 and I think Sam will be happy there
5123290 5125289 He's been out of school over two weeks now
5125290 5126500 It's time to get back
5127780 5130090 We needed sometime to sort a few things out
5132140 5133619 And you are having a party!
5133620 5135620 It's Sam's birthday today
5136100 5138769 My first birthday I've ever celebrated
5138770 5140770 - That's not true!<br />- Yes it is!
5141230 5142920 My first party on the day!
5142970 5143980 That's unusual
5148370 5150440 My husband died the day that Sam was born
5150670 5154230 He got killed driving mum to the hospital to have me!
5156350 5157870 Sam's just like his dad was
5158770 5160160 Always speaks his mind
5160650 5163900 Parties are a lot of fun! Especially when they are yours!
5165060 5169220 My cousin's not coming because I<br />broke her nose in two places!
5172790 5174360 I'll take that for you
5193700 5194830 Good shot!
5195380 5196830 Look there's another one!
5198070 5198830 Get your bowl
5203170 5205480 Wow you've got a lot today!
5207100 5208690 And may I begin to see it?
5210200 5212200 One day when you're bigger
5218680 5220000 You go outside
5220400 5222000 And you don't come in until I tell you
5267750 5268600 It's all right
5269470 5270600 It's all right
5271300 5272600 It's all right
5307820 5308890 How was it?
5310120 5311680 Just a bit quiet today
5313910 5314820 Come here
5319700 5321210 It's getting much better mum
5325980 5326970 Wait!
5328100 5329100 I have a new trick
5332780 5335740 Life is not always as it seems
5336470 5338760 Nothing in my hands nothing in my hands
5344260 5345519 Oh that's great!
5345520 5346540 I haven't finished
5356680 5359040 Abracadabra!
5361900 5363720 How did you do that!
5369130 5371320 Come here you! Come here
5383100 5384869 Happy birthday sweetheart
