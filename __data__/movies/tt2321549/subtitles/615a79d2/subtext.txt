72480 73999 Mum!
89800 91199 Mum!
94080 95479 Mummy!
98520 99999 Mum!
101920 103359 Mum!
104520 106479 I had the dream again.
115640 117799 "And he climbed down<br />that chimney,
117800 121079 "straight into<br />the huge black pot.
121080 125159 "And that was the end of<br />the big, bad wolf."
128760 131039 Did they really kill the wolf,<br />Mum?
131040 133519 I'm sure they did.
133520 135919 I'll kill the monster<br />when it comes.
135920 137999 I'll smash its head in.
140320 142239 It's time to go to sleep now,<br />sweetie.
142240 143719 It's very late.
143720 146519 Can we read it again?
149520 152999 "A long time ago -<br />just yesterday, in fact -
153000 157839 "there were three little pigs<br />and one nasty big wolf."
227000 228119 What have you done?
228120 229879 It's not broken.<br />It just slipped.
229880 232159 I don't want you firing<br />things off in the house anymore.
232160 235199 Wait, wait, wait. Watch this. When the<br />monster comes, I'm gonna do this.
235200 236359 Please don't!
239880 241199 Nothing in my hands.
241200 243719 - Nothing in my hands.<br />- Stand still, please.
243720 245239 Look at me, Mum!
245240 246439 Come on, Samuel.
246440 248679 - Look at me.<br />- Stand still, please.
248680 250519 Nothing in my hands.<br />Nothing in my hands.
250520 252039 I don't want you<br />making weapons anymore.
252040 253959 It doesn't work<br />if you don't look at me.
253960 257039 This monster thing<br />has got to stop, alright?
265760 266879 Mmm.
270000 272159 Don't do that!
274760 276159 Ready?
278320 279879 Come on.
284200 285759 Quick. You're late already.
285760 287479 What have you got in there?
287480 288919 See you later, alligator.
298200 300599 Here's one for you, Norma.<br />It's got milk in it.
300600 301719 What?
301720 303599 One with your milk in it.
303600 305399 I don't want milk.
305400 308159 No worries.<br />I'll make you another one.
311800 314519 Ah, just where a woman<br />should be. In the kitchen.
314520 316839 Hmm. Get to work, woman.
317680 318799 Do you want a cuppa?
318800 321719 Nah. I'm heading for<br />the dementia ward.
321720 322759 Aw.
322760 324759 It's a few years before<br />you end up there, isn't it?
325600 327239 Right?
331920 332719 Amelia?
332720 334399 Your son's school<br />is on the phone.
339200 340759 Oh, my God.
340760 342119 Did he hurt anyone?
342120 344439 A dart could have gone into<br />a child's eye or even worse.
345680 347439 I'm going to have a serious talk<br />with him.
347440 349679 Mrs Fanning,<br />we've had the talks.
349680 351319 We've had the sessions<br />with the counsellor.
351320 355319 We're going to have to employ<br />a monitor for him.
355320 356559 Monitor?
356560 358439 He'll be separated<br />from the other children.
358440 361159 The monitor will supervise him<br />one-on-one.
361160 362479 Samuel won't cope with this.
362480 363879 He already feels so different.
363880 366639 I'll have a talk with him.<br />I'll have a serious talk...
366640 367719 Mrs Fanning,
367720 370079 the boy has significant<br />behavioural problems.
370080 373799 You know, Samuel doesn't need<br />a full-time monitor.
373800 375959 What he needs<br />is some understanding.
375960 378559 I have 24 other<br />first graders in that class.
378560 380959 Do you want me to put them<br />all at risk because of your son?
380960 382519 I think I'll just find<br />another school.
382520 384919 Mrs Fanning, you can't just<br />take the boy out of school.
384920 386879 You look after your business<br />and I'll go and find a school
386880 388599 that sees my son<br />as a human being
388600 390519 and not just as another problem<br />to be gotten rid of.
390520 393399 That is very unfair. We're only<br />trying to help the boy.
393400 395759 Please stop calling him<br />'the boy'.
395760 397879 His name is Samuel.
404800 407599 We can see Ruby and<br />Aunty Claire at the park today.
407600 409679 You can play<br />on that swing you like
409680 411519 for as long as you like, OK?
411520 414439 Mrs Bruen hates me.
414440 415999 No, she doesn't.
417600 419319 Just need a break, that's all.
421400 423439 Don't tell Aunty Claire<br />what happened.
425160 427519 I'll tell her later.
429240 432439 - Mum, come and look at this!<br />- I can do it again.
434160 435799 Sam, don't bother the lady.
435800 437359 No, no, no. That's alright.
437360 439159 We have to go home and<br />see Daddy, though, haven't we?
439160 440719 My dad's in the cemetery.
440720 441879 Oh. That's...
441880 444759 He got killed driving Mum<br />to the hospital to have me.
444760 447359 Samuel.
447360 448719 I'm sorry. He just...
448720 451479 No, that's alright.<br />I shouldn't have...
451480 454479 Well, your mum is very lucky<br />to have you, then, isn't she?
454480 456199 We have to go.
456200 458319 - Say, "See you later," Katie.<br />- Bye.
459440 461279 The artist was so drunk,<br />he vomited.
461280 462879 Right in front of<br />his own installation.
462880 464799 Lost all these sales.
464800 466759 You're not listening.
466760 468439 I am. I am.
468440 471439 So you lost all these sales<br />and then what happened?
471440 473359 Ruby! Don't play there.<br />It's wet.
473360 475839 Mum! Mum!
475840 478559 I'm gonna smash its head!
480880 483679 - Be careful.<br />- Mum, Mum! I'm gonna smash it.
486600 488799 What would you like me<br />to do for Wednesday?
488800 491839 I can get their birthday cakes.<br />That's easy.
493600 495959 I was hoping Ruby<br />would change her mind.
497480 499919 She doesn't want a joint party<br />with Sam this year.
499920 503079 - Oh.<br />- Mum! Mum!
503080 504599 She wants to have<br />a princess party.
504600 506759 Mum! Mum!
506760 508199 That's OK.
508200 510359 We don't have to come.
510360 512239 You can still come.
512240 513319 Mum!
513320 515439 She just doesn't want to share<br />the day with Sam anymore.
515440 517439 - I understand. I understand.<br />- Mum!
517440 520639 Mum, I can go really high!<br />Watch.
523680 525519 Maybe you want to celebrate<br />his birthday properly
525520 526759 this year, anyway.
526760 528999 - On the day.<br />- Yeah, we'll see.
530120 532599 You know, Amelia,<br />I just want you to be happy
532600 534519 and then this birthday thing<br />rolls around
534520 535679 and I end up feeling awful.
535680 536879 I don't want you to feel awful,<br />Claire.
538600 539999 We'll be fine.
540000 541119 We'll be absolutely fine.
541120 542799 Mum! Look at me!
548040 549799 Mama!
554920 557839 - Who do we have here?<br />- Hello, Mrs Roach.
557840 559759 You look tired, little one.
559760 561999 Have you been in the wars today?
562000 563359 A few wars.
563360 565919 He's had a big day, that's all.
565920 567479 He's just exhausted.
567480 569239 Poor little sweetheart.
569240 570599 Bugsy.
570600 572279 Come here, little girl. Hello.
572280 574799 You look tired too, love.
574800 576159 You OK?
576160 578279 Nothing five years of sleep<br />wouldn't fix.
579240 581079 I'll put your rubbish out<br />for you, Grace.
581080 583719 No, no, no.<br />You've just got in, pet.
583720 585239 I'll do it now. Then it's done.
623760 625519 You can choose one tonight.
632200 633679 Where did you get this?
633680 635119 On the shelf.
641360 644119 "If it's in a word<br />or it's in a look,
644120 646799 "you can't get rid of<br />the Babadook.
649560 652999 "If you're a really clever one<br />and you know what it is to see,
653000 655879 "then you can make friends<br />with a special one -
655880 657359 "a friend of you and me."
662000 666839 "His name is Mister Babadook<br />and this is his book.
666840 671359 "A rumbling sound,<br />then three sharp knocks -
671360 674759 "ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!
674760 677679 "That's when you'll know<br />he's around.
677680 679919 "You'll see him if you look.
682520 686279 "Ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!"
686280 688159 We might read another one<br />tonight, hey?
688160 689959 But you said I could choose.
694320 696959 "This is what he wears on top.
696960 699039 "He's funny, don't you think?
702080 704159 "See him<br />in your room at night..."
706280 708199 Mum? Does it hurt the boy?
710280 711479 Mum?
711480 714159 Does it live under the bed? Mum?
715640 717119 Mummy?
719120 720679 Mummy?!
721880 722919 "How sweetly they sung,
722920 724599 "telling of the happiness<br />and loveliness
724600 726679 "that lay at the bottom of<br />the ocean
726680 729119 and entreating the sirens<br />not to be afraid."
795680 798519 It's that time of<br />night again.
798520 799159 Time...
799160 801519 If that's what<br />the doctor ordered, I...
801520 803799 Oh, yeah. Yeah.<br />That's what the doctor ordered.
817160 818679 Do you...
900400 901599 Mum!
901600 903359 - It's in my room!<br />- What is?
903360 905079 - The Babadook!<br />- Oh, no.
905080 909599 No, no, no.<br />This is not going to happen.
909600 912239 The closet doors were closed<br />and now they're wide open.
912240 914159 It's just a book.
914160 916439 It can't hurt you.
916440 919079 You've had a big day.
919080 921599 You're just exhausted.
922800 926159 I don't want anything bad<br />to happen to you, Mum.
928280 931639 Nothing bad's going to happen,<br />Sam.
931640 934079 I'm gonna protect you.
1001360 1003919 Mum, it's 9:00.
1014560 1016599 He's not running a fever<br />anymore.
1016600 1020799 No, no, no. My sister's gonna<br />take him. Put it back!
1020800 1022559 Put it back<br />or it goes in the bin.
1023760 1025679 Sorry. What was that?
1025680 1029079 Oh, no. I couldn't get to<br />the phone. He was vomiting.
1029080 1031839 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />No worries. I'll see you soon.
1031840 1035079 Samuel, no monster talk<br />at Aunty Claire's, OK?
1036240 1040119 Samuel - no Babadook.<br />No nothing. Alright?
1047560 1050079 88. Number 88.
1050080 1051919 Two fat ladies.
1051920 1053479 Good, Elaine!
1053480 1055999 Another few days and someone<br />could call out, "Bingo!"
1059360 1060639 Number 11.
1060640 1062319 Who has number 11?
1062320 1064319 Legs 11.
1064320 1067039 Hey? See what else we've got.
1069280 1071199 5 billion.
1071200 1073519 Anyone got 5 billion?
1084160 1086799 Beverley's not very impressed<br />with your bingo skills.
1089800 1092279 - Are you alright?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
1092280 1094919 No, I'm fine. How are you?<br />How's D wing?
1094920 1097999 Fine. Yeah.<br />Just a bunch of old people.
1100520 1103279 You don't have to be fine,<br />you know.
1103280 1106559 Just a bit stressed<br />at the moment.
1106560 1108319 Why don't you go home?
1109400 1112719 Old cranky bitch -<br />she goes after lunch.
1112720 1113599 I can cover for you.
1113600 1116119 - You'd do that?<br />- Yeah.
1117800 1119679 I'll give you my pay.
1119680 1121519 Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.
1121520 1123719 You've got a sick boy.
1123720 1125519 Life's too short.
1125520 1128279 You're so sweet, Robbie.
1129440 1131679 - You should go.<br />- Yeah.
1131680 1134759 - Say hi to Sam for me.<br />- I will.
1183400 1186719 Where have you been?<br />You weren't at work.
1186720 1187919 Rung you a million times.
1187920 1188919 What happened?
1188920 1190919 Just scared the crap<br />out of Ruby. That's all.
1190920 1193959 He insisted on talking to this<br />bloody Babadook thing all day.
1193960 1196119 Just talking to the air -<br />even freaked me out.
1196120 1197119 I'm so sorry.
1197120 1198519 You need to get him<br />to see someone, Amelia.
1198520 1200359 It's not normal for a kid<br />to carry on with this rubbish.
1200360 1201759 It's not rubbish. It's real!
1201760 1203799 Don't you talk to<br />your Aunty Claire like that.
1206400 1208039 Where did you get<br />those firecrackers?
1208040 1209879 You got them for me<br />on the internet.
1209880 1211239 Well,<br />that's the end of the internet.
1213480 1216239 If the Babadook was real, we'd<br />see it right now, wouldn't we?
1216240 1219719 It wants to scare you first<br />then you'll see it.
1219720 1221479 Well, I'm not scared.
1221480 1224479 You will be when it creeps<br />into your room at night.
1224480 1226079 That's enough.
1226080 1228559 You will be<br />when it eats your insides.
1228560 1229359 I've decided
1229360 1231159 you're not having your birthday<br />with Ruby this week.
1231160 1232799 No cake, no games.<br />That's the end of it.
1237280 1238759 Samuel.
1247800 1251719 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />Mum and Dad,
1251720 1254279 life is not always as it seems.
1254280 1257399 It can be a wondrous thing.
1257400 1261639 But it can also be<br />very treacherous.
1269360 1272559 Don't worry, Dad. I'll save Mum.
1272560 1275439 I'm gonna trap<br />the Babadook like this.
1278240 1281319 And when it's trapped,<br />I'm gonna kill it.
1281320 1283319 Samuel.
1292280 1294079 I was just<br />putting something back.
1294080 1295439 All your father's things<br />are down there.
1295440 1296439 He's my father.
1296440 1298479 You don't own him!
1300120 1302279 Just thought I'd see<br />how you're going.
1305600 1306879 Can I come in?
1308160 1311159 Hey, matey. This is for you.
1311160 1313839 My mum always got me a model<br />plane when I was sick.
1313840 1315279 I'm not sick.
1316840 1319079 Oh. I-I thought...
1319080 1320679 No, he's not, actually.
1320680 1323639 The truth is he's so disobedient<br />he can't go to school anymore.
1323640 1324639 You said that's not true.
1324640 1326119 How many 6-year-old boys<br />do you know, Robbie,
1326120 1327239 who still believe in monsters?
1327240 1328359 I hate you!
1328360 1329839 She won't let me have<br />a birthday party
1329840 1332759 and she won't let me have a dad!
1397080 1398759 Ohh.
1403360 1404559 Don't eat it.
1417040 1418879 The Babadook did it, Mum.
1420480 1421999 Go and watch a DVD<br />and I'll make something else.
1422000 1423479 The Babadook did it!
1423480 1425199 Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.
1425200 1427759 Ladies and gentlemen,
1427760 1429759 girls and boys,
1429760 1434999 welcome to the great Martin's<br />DVD 'School of Magic'.
1435000 1437959 Life is not always as it seems.
1437960 1441919 It can be a wondrous thing.
1441920 1445799 But it can also be<br />very treacherous.
1445800 1448039 In this DVD,
1448040 1452479 you will learn magic tricks<br />to surprise, to delight
1452480 1457879 and perhaps even shock<br />your family and friends.
1480320 1481999 Do you think this is funny?
1483320 1486119 Oh, no. No. No!
1488080 1489679 Give it to me!
1491160 1493719 Do you wanna die?
1563240 1565719 Don't let it in!<br />Don't let it in!
1565720 1569279 Don't let it in! Don't<br />let it in! Don't let it in!
1569280 1570999 Don't let it in!
1638960 1642239 Mum, do we have to<br />go to Ruby's party?
1652200 1654639 I've already got this doll, Mum.
1654640 1655919 Now she's got a twin.
1655920 1657079 They can go shopping together.
1661480 1664039 Off you go.
1664040 1666319 He's just really tired.
1670960 1673359 Go and play right now.
1679600 1682159 Claire tells me you're a writer.
1682160 1684759 Oh, no, not really. Not anymore.
1684760 1687159 What kind of writing did you do?
1687160 1690959 I wrote some articles for some<br />magazines, did some kids' stuff.
1690960 1693279 You just need to get<br />back into it. That's all.
1693280 1694679 It must be difficult.
1694680 1697999 I do volunteer work<br />with some disadvantaged women
1698000 1700639 and a few of them<br />have lost their husbands
1700640 1703199 and they find it very hard.
1705000 1706599 How's Richard's merger going?
1706600 1710679 Oh, good. I mean,<br />his workload's just ballooned.
1710680 1713359 I've got the kids 24/7,<br />it feels like.
1713360 1714479 Tell me about it!
1714480 1716719 I don't even have time to go to the gym<br />anymore. It's ridiculous!
1716720 1718279 That's a real tragedy.
1718280 1721479 Not having time to go to the gym<br />anymore. How do you cope?
1721480 1723479 You must have so much<br />to talk about
1723480 1725079 with those poor<br />disadvantaged women.
1736040 1739599 This is my tree house.<br />You're not allowed in here.
1739600 1740999 I'm not hurting anybody.
1743440 1745199 Bye.
1747080 1749039 - Thanks.<br />- Thanks.
1754760 1756639 How would your mum know<br />if it's real or not?
1756640 1758599 She never comes to our house.
1758600 1760999 Mum told Dad she didn't want<br />to go to your house
1761000 1762799 'cause it's too depressing.
1762800 1765679 The Babadook would eat your mum<br />for breakfast.
1765680 1768119 - It'd rip her arms off.<br />- Shut up!
1768120 1771199 They feel sorry for me, Claire.<br />There's a big difference.
1771200 1773519 God, Amelia, as soon as anyone<br />mentions Oskar, you can't cope.
1773520 1775999 - That's not true.<br />- It'll be seven years.
1776000 1777399 Isn't it time you moved on?
1777400 1778879 I have moved on.
1778880 1782199 I don't mention him.<br />I don't talk about him.
1782200 1784239 What strain is that on you,<br />Claire?
1784240 1786919 You're not even<br />good enough to have a dad.
1786920 1788879 Everyone else has one<br />and you don't.
1788880 1790479 I do have a dad!
1790480 1793239 I listen to your life<br />day in, day out,
1793240 1796199 and you never stop to ask me<br />anything about mine.
1796200 1797399 I do!
1797400 1799039 I want to know how you are.
1799040 1800679 You don't come round<br />to our house anymore.
1800680 1802799 Because I can't stand<br />being around your son.
1802800 1805319 I can't believe<br />you just said that.
1805320 1807759 You can't stand being around him<br />yourself.
1807760 1810159 Your dad died so he didn't<br />have to be with you.
1810160 1811599 That's not true!
1811600 1812759 And your mum doesn't want you.
1812760 1814999 No-one wants you.
1825640 1826799 What did you do?!
1826800 1829359 She said I didn't have a dad.<br />She kept saying it.
1830920 1832479 Is she alright?
1832480 1834999 Stay here<br />and look after the children
1835000 1836999 or do you want another one<br />to get hurt?
1837000 1841879 Mummy!<br />She wouldn't believe me!
1841880 1844279 Mummy! Mummy!
1844280 1846119 Mummy!
1846120 1849959 - Mummy! Mummy!<br />- Why can't you just be normal?!
1851480 1853679 There is no Babadook!
1855360 1857519 Get out!
1860080 1862639 - Get out!<br />- Samuel?
1862640 1864799 - Mummy!<br />- Stop this now!
1864800 1867559 Get out! Get out! Get out!
1885960 1887159 Please help me!
1887160 1889239 There's something wrong<br />with my son.
1900640 1903719 I think it may have been<br />a febrile convulsion.
1903720 1905519 That's when the brain overheats.
1905520 1906799 It always looks worse<br />than it is.
1906800 1908599 I've never seen<br />anything like this.
1908600 1910599 We'll have to wait<br />until the tests come back.
1910600 1912319 All his other results<br />are normal.
1912320 1916319 He's obviously suffering<br />a high level of anxiety.
1916320 1917999 Very committed to<br />the monster theory.
1918000 1919319 That's an understatement.
1920400 1922919 All children see monsters.
1922920 1924599 Not like this.
1925880 1927879 And it's getting worse.
1927880 1930479 He's becoming aggressive.
1930480 1931999 He could see a psychiatrist.
1932000 1933559 I can refer you.
1933560 1935079 Takes a few weeks to get in.
1935080 1936239 That'd be great.
1938080 1941279 But can you just give me<br />something for now,
1941280 1943639 just to make him sleep?
1944720 1946279 Um, just until...
1947520 1949599 ...just until<br />we get an appointment.
1950760 1952839 Please?
1952840 1957439 I haven't slept in weeks<br />and neither has Samuel
1957440 1958799 and when we go home tonight,
1958800 1960719 this whole nightmare<br />will start up again
1960720 1961919 and I am really...
1961920 1964679 ...I'm really not coping.
1966840 1971279 I can give you<br />a short course of sedatives.
1971280 1973599 Just until the tests come back.
1973600 1978279 Most mothers aren't too keen<br />on them unless it's really bad.
1978280 1980199 It's really bad.
1987120 1991519 These can make children<br />feel foggy.
1991520 1993679 Perhaps some temporary nausea.
1993680 1996759 They'll certainly<br />help him sleep, though.
1996760 2000199 - That's for one week.<br />- Thank you.
2002240 2004519 Why don't people<br />like me?
2004520 2006519 Why do you say that?
2006520 2010279 Ruby said people don't like me<br />'cause I'm weird.
2011480 2015279 Sometimes people say things<br />that aren't true.
2018720 2022639 You just need to take<br />your medicine, have a big sleep
2022640 2023959 and not worry.
2025400 2027119 I don't want you to die.
2027120 2030119 I'm not gonna die<br />for a long time yet.
2030120 2034199 Did you think that about my dad<br />before he died?
2038160 2041639 Just take your pill<br />so you can go to sleep.
2041640 2043879 I've got the day off tomorrow.
2043880 2045839 Maybe we could do something,<br />hmm?
2045840 2049079 Will these make<br />the Babadook go away?
2049080 2050719 I think so
2050720 2052519 but you have to promise me<br />not to mention it again.
2052520 2056399 I promise to protect you<br />if you promise to protect me.
2056400 2058159 Then I won't mention it.
2058160 2062319 I promise to protect you.
2062320 2063959 Come on.
2074760 2075879 Come on.
2082120 2084519 Can you stay here with me?
2084520 2086359 Yes.
2086360 2088599 I love you, Mum.
2088600 2090319 Me too.
2265240 2267479 Her nose<br />is broken in two places.
2267480 2268279 She may need surgery.
2268280 2269599 I'll pay for everything.
2269600 2271279 You can't even pay<br />your own bills.
2271280 2272599 Look, I really have to go.
2272600 2276239 Claire, I think someone<br />is stalking me and Samuel.
2276240 2277559 What?
2277560 2279519 A book turned up<br />at our place.
2279520 2282999 I threw it away but somebody<br />glued it back together
2283000 2284719 and put it on our doorstep.
2284720 2287999 Amelia,<br />I just can't help you right now.
2288000 2290839 I don't expect you to help.<br />I just wanted...
2290840 2292999 If you're that worried,<br />you should go to the police.
2293000 2295719 I have to go.
2313680 2315319 Claire!
2317120 2318439 Hello?
2320040 2324359 Mmm, Babadook...
2324360 2328279 ...dook... dook.
2334440 2337239 Hi.
2337240 2341039 I want to report someone<br />stalking me and my child.
2341040 2342319 Can you tell us what happened?
2342320 2345159 Somebody sent me<br />a children's book.
2346800 2349079 And?
2349080 2352119 And it contained violent<br />and graphic images
2352120 2354079 of my child and me<br />being murdered.
2354080 2355999 Can we have a look at the book,<br />please?
2356000 2358159 I burnt it.
2358160 2360759 You burnt it?
2360760 2361839 Yes.
2361840 2364239 Well, unfortunately, there's<br />nothing we can do about it.
2366000 2369679 He's been making phone calls<br />to me as well.
2369680 2370919 What's he been saying?
2370920 2374439 Nothing,<br />just making these... noises.
2374440 2376199 How do you know<br />it's the same person?
2376200 2378559 Because of what<br />he wrote in the book.
2378560 2380239 The book you burnt?
2380240 2382319 Yes.
2398000 2399079 OK.
2400600 2402519 Don't worry about it.
2411800 2413839 Did you get your things done?
2413840 2415919 Mrs Roach has Parkinson's.
2415920 2417639 That's why she shakes like this.
2417640 2419319 Samuel, you don't have to<br />say everything
2419320 2420519 that goes through your head.
2420520 2422999 Oh, it's alright, love.
2423000 2427799 He wanted to know<br />so we talked about it.
2427800 2430359 He sees things as they are,<br />that one.
2430360 2431999 Oskar was the same.
2432000 2433639 He always spoke his mind.
2433640 2436399 Do you have to<br />keep on bringing him up?
2442160 2443599 Hey, Bugsy.
2443600 2446519 Hey.
2446520 2448799 Hey!
2463280 2464959 Eugh!
2511920 2514079 Don't come in here.
2526000 2528319 I don't want to buy anything.
2528320 2530319 Are you Amelia Vanick?
2530320 2531319 Yes.
2531320 2533799 I'm Warren Newton<br />and this is Prue Flannery
2533800 2535519 from the Department of<br />Community Services.
2535520 2537479 My son's only been<br />away for two days.
2537480 2540879 He's not actually registered<br />at Babbage Bay anymore.
2540880 2542999 If I could just come in<br />and meet Samuel
2543000 2544919 and get you to look at<br />these papers, that'd be great.
2546040 2549399 I'm just in the middle<br />of cleaning up the house
2549400 2550919 at the moment.
2550920 2554719 I'm sorry.<br />There's stuff everywhere.
2557240 2559519 Hello, Samuel.
2559520 2563359 I'm Prue and this is Warren.
2564800 2566279 How are you?
2566280 2569839 I'm a bit tired from the drugs<br />Mum gave me.
2569840 2573759 Not drugs. Tranquillisers...<br />from the doctor.
2573760 2575559 He had a fit yesterday.
2575560 2578839 I'm really tired, actually.
2578840 2580479 That's no good.
2583240 2585319 May I have a glass of water,<br />please?
2585320 2589479 Yes. Of course. I'll get you one.
2596080 2597999 It's a real mess.
2598000 2600319 I just found<br />this cockroach infestation.
2600320 2601799 I normally have<br />the house sprayed.
2601800 2603599 I did actually already<br />have it sprayed
2603600 2606319 but there's this hole<br />in the wall behind the fridge
2606320 2607919 and that's why I...
2612560 2615119 I didn't mean<br />a hole in the wall.
2615120 2617519 There was a hole<br />in the wallpaper.
2617520 2619719 That's where they were<br />laying their eggs, I think.
2619720 2621799 We've caught you<br />at a bad time.
2623040 2624679 I'll leave you with this.
2624680 2627199 We're required<br />to come back in a week
2627200 2628919 to talk through your options.
2628920 2631039 Here's my card.
2632240 2636759 Mum,<br />I think I'm gonna vomit.
2655480 2657919 What was<br />that noise I heard?
2657920 2660679 I didn't hear any noise.
2660680 2662879 Wind howling,<br />doors slamming.
2662880 2665719 I declare, I think this house<br />is haunted.
2666240 2669839 Mum, I'm gonna go to bed.
2669840 2671759 Are you sick?
2671760 2672999 Oh, no, Granny.
2674560 2676559 It's only 6:00.
2676560 2679199 Don't you want to stay up<br />with your mum for a while?
2679200 2680599 No.
2680600 2683519 If you go to bed now,<br />the pills won't work properly.
2686840 2690399 You have to stay up for a while,<br />sweetheart.
2704680 2706679 Where's its mother,<br />Skip?
2706680 2708199 Koalas don't leave<br />their babies about.
2708200 2710159 Are you off now, Dad?
2710160 2711799 Yep.<br />Soon as I fuel up.
2711800 2713679 Tell Jerry I'll keep in touch<br />on the radio
2713680 2715759 and I'll be back before breakfast<br />the day after tomorrow.
2717280 2719479 "And the Prince<br />and the Princess
2719480 2722319 "lived happily together<br />in a beautiful palace
2722320 2724719 "for the rest of their days."
2823240 2826839 Babadook...
2826840 2830639 ...dook... dook.
2863600 2866079 What are we doing?
2866080 2867839 We're going downstairs.
2867840 2870119 - Why?<br />- Because we are.
2888160 2890999 Iris, Iris, Iris.
2891000 2892759 No.
2940320 2942079 Glass and mirror attachment.
2942080 2943999 Clean and polish<br />shower doors or mirrors
2944000 2945479 for a streak-free shine.
2945480 2946799 As part of<br />your steaming special,
2946800 2948559 we'll even include<br />the garment and upholst...
2948560 2951919 Oh, I don't want to give it<br />to anyone at work.
2953600 2956519 Alright.<br />Give all my shifts away.
2956520 2957799 That's just what I need.
2959640 2960959 I can't help it if I'm sick.
2960960 2962319 What do you expect me to do?
2963480 2964999 You do that!
2978880 2983439 Mum, I took the pills<br />but I feel sick again.
2985080 2987719 I need to eat something.
2991680 2995239 I couldn't find any food<br />in the fridge.
2996960 3000119 You said to have them with food.
3000120 3003919 I'm really hungry, Mum.
3003920 3007879 Why do you have to keep talk,<br />talk, talking?
3007880 3009759 Don't you ever stop?
3009760 3013239 - I was just...<br />- I need to sleep!
3013240 3016599 I'm sorry, Mummy.<br />I was just really hungry.
3016600 3020679 If you're that hungry,<br />why don't you go and eat shit?
3052840 3054439 I'm so sorry.
3054440 3057479 I don't know why I said that.<br />It was terrible.
3058680 3062159 I've had absolutely no sleep.
3062160 3064439 I didn't know what I was saying.
3066160 3068039 I'll cook you something. Hey?
3069320 3070599 What would you like?
3070600 3072479 I'm not hungry anymore.
3079240 3081079 We really need to get<br />out of this house.
3081080 3083439 We've been cooped up here<br />too long. That's the problem.
3088080 3089879 Do you want to go to Wally's?
3090960 3093399 You can have anything you want.<br />Alright?
3093400 3096959 Even ice-cream for breakfast<br />if you like.
3099240 3102279 Give it back!
3102280 3106199 - Stop it! Sit down. Sit down.<br />- No!
3106200 3108079 - Now!<br />- Give my drink back!
3108080 3109439 Sit down, please.
3115400 3116599 Where are we going?
3116600 3119559 I just want to drive<br />for a little while.
3130800 3133039 Aarggh!
3133040 3134959 Mummy! Mummy!
3137240 3139359 Babadook.
3150200 3151199 You ran straight into me!
3151200 3155399 I just bought this bloody car.<br />What were you thinking?
3156640 3159119 Oh, driving on the wrong side of<br />the road with a kid in the back.
3159120 3160999 You could've killed someone!
3161000 3163639 Hey!
3163640 3164639 Hey, what are you doing?
3164640 3166519 Hey! Crazy bitch!
3173000 3175319 Hi, sweetheart.
3183080 3184639 Mum?
3186040 3188399 I can call Aunty Claire.
3191200 3194119 I can call<br />and she can come over.
3197400 3198799 Mum?
3198800 3203199 Aunty Claire doesn't want<br />to talk to us anymore.
3204680 3207759 Mum. Mum, look at me.
3232880 3235439 It's nice and warm in here.
3238840 3240959 I don't want you to go away.
3243040 3245159 I'm not going anywhere.
3257040 3258399 Mum?
3265720 3269799 Mum, I don't think<br />we should stay here tonight.
3271080 3273159 I can call Mrs Roach.
3273160 3276839 I don't want you to call anyone.
3279640 3282079 I just need to sleep.
3286080 3288119 - Mum...<br />- Leave it!
3318200 3320159 There's something<br />in the house.
3334200 3336039 There's someone in the house!
3389120 3390759 Mrs Roach...
3390760 3392759 ...can we come and stay<br />the night?
3401800 3403719 Gracie, I'm so sorry.
3403720 3406039 Has someone<br />broken into the house?
3406040 3408999 - Sam said that...<br />- No, no, no. We're fine.
3409000 3410839 Samuel's just being<br />very disobedient again.
3410840 3413039 Oh, I was so worried.
3413040 3414519 I told him not to call anyone.
3414520 3416359 He asked<br />if you could stay the night.
3416360 3419079 No, no, no. We're fine. I just<br />have a headache. That's all.
3419080 3420999 I really have to go, though,<br />now, Gracie.
3422480 3423999 I'm so sorry for troubling you.
3424000 3425519 Yes. Talk soon.
3425520 3426999 No worries. Talk soon.
3429480 3431919 I told you not to call anyone
3431920 3433799 and you deliberately<br />disobeyed me.
3434920 3437039 Do you want to frighten<br />Mrs Roach?
3437040 3439159 An old lady who can hardly walk?
3439160 3440639 Do you want to make her sick?
3442440 3444519 Get that bloody thing off!
3448480 3453399 Is this the only way I can trust<br />you not to embarrass me
3453400 3454839 in front of our neighbours?
3459360 3460879 Is this what I have to do?
3472040 3473159 I'm sorry, Mummy.
3473160 3475319 It's just that the Babadook made<br />you crash the car and then...
3475320 3477239 What'd you say?
3477240 3478839 I said the Babadook...
3478840 3480399 The Babadook isn't real, Samuel.
3480400 3484079 He's just something you've made up<br />in your stupid little head.
3484080 3486519 I just didn't want you<br />to let it in!
3486520 3490079 I'll make sure nothing<br />gets in tonight.
3490080 3491599 Alright, Samuel?
3491600 3494039 Nothing is coming in here<br />tonight.
3494040 3495519 Nothing!
3531200 3533559 I feel sick.
3533560 3537759 If you don't take the pill,<br />you'll feel worse.
3537760 3539319 Mum, I don't think I need...
3539320 3542239 I am the parent and you are<br />the child so take the pill.
3564760 3566879 Good boy.
3585720 3588639 Ohh!
3588640 3589919 Mum!
3606400 3609799 Hey, Bugsy. Hey, sweetie.
3611880 3614159 Come here, sweetie. Hey?
3615360 3616599 Hey.
3617720 3619199 Hey!
3639280 3640919 Here we go.
3646560 3648639 There's more<br />where that came from.
3659320 3660999 Oh!
3664360 3666479 Aarggh!
3666480 3667679 What's the secret?
3670160 3671799 ...letter of Max's, didn't you?
3671800 3673279 No, not for a minute.
3673280 3675079 Don't lie.<br />You called me a Jezebel. Why?
3675080 3677199 - The north, east.<br />- Natural corset.
3677200 3678599 With fresh meat.
3680840 3683639 Only five...
3683640 3685959 You don't wanna go<br />in there all by yourself, do you?
3687760 3690079 Police say the woman<br />used a kitchen knife
3690080 3691599 to stab her son.
3691600 3693679 His body was found<br />in their basement.
3693680 3696319 The woman later attacked<br />officers with a knife.
3696320 3700399 They drew their guns<br />and shot her to death.
3700400 3702279 Little is known about the tragedy
3702280 3706079 but neighbours say the boy was<br />celebrating his birthday today.
3706080 3708399 He had just turned seven.
3722200 3723719 Samuel?
3727840 3729319 Wake up, Mummy.
3732160 3735279 But you're the one who's asleep,<br />sweetheart.
3740600 3742279 Don't go down there.
3746800 3748439 It's not safe.
3783800 3786839 Ohh... I thought you were dead.
3787920 3790359 I thought you were dead.
3804240 3806199 We're gonna be together.
3808720 3810999 You just need to bring me<br />the boy.
3832480 3834879 You mean Samuel?
3834880 3837079 You can bring me the boy.
3839640 3841159 You can bring me the boy.
3843160 3844679 You can bring me the boy.
3844680 3846039 Stop calling him 'the boy'.
3846040 3848159 I think it's going to rain.
3848160 3849519 No.
3937680 3940679 It isn't real. It isn't real.<br />It isn't real.
3952360 3954479 Oh, no.
3959760 3961519 No! No!
3969240 3970679 Bugsy!
4077880 4079559 Samuel!
4084720 4086199 Samuel.
4087920 4091959 Bugsy's hurt<br />and we need to get help.
4094440 4096799 You don't want him to die,<br />do you?
4100640 4102359 Samuel.
4102360 4105279 Are you listening to me?
4109040 4111399 Let me in, you little shit!
4111400 4113759 Let me in!
4113760 4114999 Let me in!
4115000 4116479 Let me in!
4116480 4119319 Let me in!
4140720 4142879 You little pig!
4142880 4146559 Six years old and you're still<br />wetting yourself.
4146560 4148639 You don't know how many times
4148640 4152399 I wished it was you, not him,<br />that died.
4152400 4154079 I just want you to be happy.
4154080 4157079 "I just<br />want you to be happy."
4160280 4161759 Sometimes...
4161760 4165439 ...I just wanna smash<br />your head against a brick wall
4165440 4168559 until your fucking brains<br />pop out.
4168560 4170559 You're not my mother.
4170560 4172079 What did you say?
4172080 4174599 I said<br />you're not my mother!
4174600 4177999 I am your mother!
4179800 4183399 Run, run, run,<br />as fast as you can!
4186640 4187959 Get away!
4187960 4189799 Didn't I tell you<br />not to play with weapons?
4194800 4196519 - Argh!<br />- Argh!
4236800 4239679 I'm sorry, love. I know it's late.
4239680 4241759 I just wanted to make sure<br />you were OK.
4241760 4244639 I'm OK.
4244640 4250319 I know... this time of year's<br />terribly hard for you.
4250320 4254439 And I know you don't want me<br />to go on about it, so I won't.
4254440 4256479 But I just wanted you to know
4256480 4259439 that I'd do anything<br />for you and Sam.
4259440 4261399 I love you both.
4264560 4266239 Samuel.
4269000 4270599 I'm sorry.
4273400 4275239 I understand you're scared.
4275240 4279079 I haven't been good<br />since your dad died.
4279080 4282039 I haven't been good at all.
4284720 4288079 I'm sick, Sam. I need help.
4292160 4294799 I just spoke with Mrs Roach.
4297560 4299959 We're going to<br />stay there tonight.
4299960 4302759 Do you want that?
4307040 4309999 I want to make it up to you,<br />Sam.
4320680 4322639 I want you to meet your dad.
4324360 4326799 It's beautiful there.
4328360 4330839 You'll be happy.
4337200 4338799 Sorry, Mummy!
4385280 4387319 Mum!
4387320 4389879 Mum!
4389880 4391999 I'm not leaving you.
4394800 4397599 Mum? Mum?
4404240 4407079 You said<br />we'd protect each other.
4412640 4414879 I know you don't love me.
4416240 4418399 The Babadook won't let you.
4418400 4420639 But I love you, Mum.
4422000 4424279 And I always will.
4433400 4437399 You let it in.<br />You have to get it out!
4441320 4444039 I don't want you to go away.
4444040 4445559 No! No! No!
4445560 4447639 Mummy!
4495680 4497119 Mummy!
4497120 4499119 Mummy!
4499120 4500999 Mummy!
4501000 4503359 Mummy! Mummy!
4503360 4505439 Mummy!
4505440 4506959 Mummy!
4543280 4544639 What is it?
4544640 4546399 You can't get rid of<br />the Babadook.
4563840 4564799 Ooh!
4575680 4576839 What do you want?
4580280 4581959 What do you want?
4618280 4619959 No.
4619960 4622839 Keep breathing.
4625960 4628999 Put your seat back, sweetheart.<br />10 more minutes and we're there.
4633200 4635159 No.
4639760 4641119 I think it's gonna rain.
4641120 4643039 Stop!
4689280 4691439 You are nothing.
4703280 4704599 You're nothing!
4713640 4716079 This is my house!
4719960 4723279 You are trespassing in my house!
4732520 4737159 If you touch my son again<br />I'll fucking kill you!
4745560 4747639 No!
4789640 4790799 Mummy, don't!
4796720 4798719 Don't!
4824840 4830559 Aaaargh!
4900480 4902959 Watch out for your mum's leg,<br />little one.
4902960 4904879 He's fine.<br />I've had the stitches out.
4904880 4906639 What time's the party?
4906640 4907919 Any time after three is fine.
4907920 4909759 I'll see you in a few hours, then.
4909760 4911279 Bye.
4911280 4912999 Bye, Sam.
4913000 4915279 That school's<br />a good choice.
4915280 4917359 I've been doing<br />a lot of reading about it
4917360 4918999 so I think<br />Sam will be happy there.
4919000 4920639 He's been out of school<br />over two weeks now.
4920640 4922599 It's time to get back.
4922600 4925879 We needed some time<br />to sort a few things out.
4925880 4927159 Mmm.
4927160 4928919 Are you having a party?
4928920 4930599 It's Sam's birthday today.
4930600 4933799 My first birthday<br />I've ever celebrated.
4933800 4935239 That's not true.
4935240 4937759 Yes, it is.<br />My first party on the day.
4937760 4939959 That's unusual.
4942280 4945559 My husband died the day<br />that Sam was born.
4945560 4948679 He got killed driving Mum<br />to the hospital to have me.
4950720 4952719 Sam's just like his dad was.
4952720 4954759 Always speaks his mind.
4954760 4958919 Well, parties are lots of fun,<br />especially when they're yours.
4958920 4963519 My cousin's not coming because<br />I broke her nose in two places.
4965800 4967719 I'll take that for you.
4986440 4987759 Good shot.
4987760 4989959 Look, there's another one!
4989960 4991959 Where's your bowl?
4994800 4997879 Wow. You've got a lot today.
4999400 5001399 Am I ever gonna see it?
5001400 5004679 One day, when you're bigger.
5010160 5014119 You go outside, and you don't<br />come in until I tell you.
5050880 5051999 Argh!
5054240 5056919 Argh!
5056920 5059039 It's alright.
5059040 5060679 It's alright.
5060680 5062639 It's alright.
5062640 5064119 Shhh...
5065560 5067079 Shhh...
5068280 5069999 Shhh...
5071120 5072759 Shhh...
5073800 5076119 Shhh...
5095680 5097319 How was it?
5097320 5099719 It was pretty quiet today.
5101680 5103199 Come here.
5107200 5109519 It's getting much better, Mum.
5113240 5114559 Wait!
5114560 5116599 I have a new trick.
5119920 5122799 Life is not always as it seems.
5122800 5125639 Nothing in my hands.<br />Nothing in my hands.
5130600 5133359 - That's great!<br />- I haven't finished.
5142480 5145559 Abracadabra!
5147960 5149679 How did you do that?
5154760 5156479 Come here, you.
5156480 5157639 Come here.
5167680 5170159 Happy birthday, sweetheart.
