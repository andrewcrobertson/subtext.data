79121 80321 Mum!
97162 98362 Mum!
101620 102820 Mummy!
106246 107446 Mum!
109787 110987 Mum!
112495 114462 I had the dream again.
124079 126230 "And he climbed down that chimney,
126330 129096 "straight into the huge black pot.
129746 133246 "And that was the end<br />of the big, bad wolf."
137746 140022 Did they really kill the wolf, Mum?
140122 141822 I'm sure they did.
142705 145105 I'll kill the monster when it comes.
145205 147238 I'll smash its head in.
149788 151688 It's time to go to<br />sleep now, sweetie.
151788 153230 It's very late.
153330 155230 Can we read it again?
159371 162898 "A long time ago...<br />just yesterday, in fact...
162998 167165 "there were three little pigs<br />and one nasty big wolf."
240081 242981 - What have you done?<br />- It's not broken. It just slipped.
243081 245355 I don't want you firing things<br />off in the house anymore.
245455 248522 Wait, wait, wait. Watch this. When the<br />monster comes, I'm gonna do this.
248622 249989 Please don't!
253497 254774 Nothing in my hands.
254874 257397 - Nothing in my hands.<br />- Stand still, please.
257497 258981 Look at me, Mum!
259081 260231 Come on, Samuel.
260331 262564 - Look at me.<br />- Stand still, please.
262664 264482 Nothing in my hands.<br />Nothing in my hands.
264582 268065 - I don't want you making weapons anymore.<br />- It doesn't work if you don't look at me.
268165 271665 This monster thing has<br />got to stop, alright?
284874 286307 Don't do that!
289832 291032 Ready?
293540 294740 Come on.
299665 301191 Quick. You're late already.
301291 302982 What have you got in there?
303082 305248 See you later, alligator.
314248 316649 Here's one for you, Norma.<br />It's got milk in it.
316749 317816 What?
317916 319775 One with your milk in it.
319875 321575 I don't want milk.
321749 324849 No worries.<br />I'll make you another one.
328415 331149 Just where a woman<br />should be. In the kitchen.
331249 333016 Get to work, woman.
334541 335608 Do you want a cuppa?
335708 338649 Nah. I'm heading for<br />the dementia ward.
338749 342615 It's a few years before<br />you end up there, isn't it?
342715 343915 Right?
349374 352741 Amelia? Your son's<br />school is on the phone.
356958 359524 Oh, my God. Did he hurt anyone?
360000 363608 A dart could have gone into<br />a child's eye or even worse.
363708 365441 I'm going to have a<br />serious talk with him.
365541 367776 Mrs Fanning, we've had the talks.
367876 369484 We've had the sessions<br />with the counsellor.
369584 373351 We're going to have to<br />employ a monitor for him.
373750 374942 Monitor?
375042 376900 He'll be separated from<br />the other children.
377000 379734 The monitor will supervise<br />him one-on-one.
379834 381108 Samuel won't cope with this.
381208 382567 He already feels so different.
382667 385442 I'll have a talk with him.<br />I'll have a serious talk...
385542 386567 Mrs Fanning,
386667 389025 the boy has significant<br />behavioural problems.
389125 392901 You know, Samuel doesn't<br />need a full-time monitor.
393001 395150 What he needs is some understanding.
395250 397859 I have 24 other first<br />graders in that class.
397959 400360 Do you want me to put them<br />all at risk because of your son?
400460 401984 I think I'll just<br />find another school.
402084 404484 Mrs Fanning, you can't just<br />take the boy out of school.
404584 406526 You look after your business<br />and I'll go and find a school
406626 408317 that sees my son as a human being
408417 410317 and not just as another<br />problem to be gotten rid of.
410417 413317 That is very unfair.<br />We're only trying to help the boy.
413417 415777 Please stop calling him 'the boy'.
415877 417643 His name is Samuel.
425292 428109 We can see Ruby and Aunty<br />Claire at the park today.
428209 432193 You can play on that swing you<br />like for as long as you like, OK?
432293 434060 Mrs Bruen hates me.
435334 436901 No, she doesn't.
438626 441126 Just need a break, that's all.
442585 445685 Don't tell Aunty<br />Claire what happened.
446501 448334 I'll tell her later.
450753 454653 - Mum, come and look at this!<br />- I can do it again.
455877 457485 Sam, don't bother the lady.
457585 459109 No, no, no. That's alright.
459209 460984 We have to go home and see Daddy,<br />though, haven't we?
461084 462609 My dad's in the cemetery.
462709 463818 Oh. That's...
463918 466818 He got killed driving Mum<br />to the hospital to have me.
466918 468118 Samuel.
469626 470943 I'm sorry. He just...
471043 473818 No, that's alright.<br />I shouldn't have...
473918 476943 Well, your mum is very lucky<br />to have you, then, isn't she?
477043 478477 We have to go.
478835 481868 - Say, "See you later," Katie.<br />- Bye.
482209 484026 The artist was so drunk, he vomited.
484126 485693 Right in front of his<br />own installation.
485793 487693 Lost all these sales.
487793 489693 You're not listening.
489835 491068 I am. I am.
491585 494610 So you lost all these sales<br />and then what happened?
494710 496610 Ruby! Don't play there. It's wet.
496710 497910 Mum! Mum!
499293 501460 I'm gonna smash its head!
504543 508110 - Be careful.<br />- Mum, Mum! I'm gonna smash it.
510502 512694 What would you like me<br />to do for Wednesday?
512794 516294 I can get their birthday cakes.<br />That's easy.
517794 521027 I was hoping Ruby would<br />change her mind.
521836 524277 She doesn't want a joint<br />party with Sam this year.
524377 526077 - Oh.<br />- Mum! Mum!
527669 529152 She wants to have a princess party.
529252 530452 Mum! Mum!
531502 532702 That's OK.
533002 534969 We don't have to come.
535252 537019 You can still come.
537211 538237 Mum!
538337 540444 She just doesn't want to share<br />the day with Sam anymore.
540544 542529 - I understand. I understand.<br />- Mum!
542629 545329 Mum, I can go really high! Watch.
549127 552237 Maybe you want to celebrate his<br />birthday properly this year, anyway.
552337 555037 - On the day.<br />- Yeah, we'll see.
555837 558320 You know, Amelia,<br />I just want you to be happy
558420 560320 and then this birthday<br />thing rolls around
560420 564570 - and I end up feeling awful.<br />- I don't want you to feel awful, Claire.
564670 566028 We'll be fine.
566128 567195 We'll be absolutely fine.
567295 568862 Mum! Look at me!
574503 575703 Mama!
581670 584612 - Who do we have here?<br />- Hello, Mrs Roach.
584712 586612 You look tired, little one.
586712 588946 Have you been in the wars today?
589046 590280 A few wars.
590462 593028 He's had a big day, that's all.
593128 594654 He's just exhausted.
594754 596487 Poor little sweetheart.
596587 597787 Bugsy.
598003 599654 Come here, little girl. Hello.
599754 601920 You look tired too, love.
602379 603579 You OK?
603796 606904 Nothing five years<br />of sleep wouldn't fix.
607004 608821 I'll put your rubbish<br />out for you, Grace.
608921 611571 No, no, no. You've just got in, pet.
611671 614237 I'll do it now. Then it's done.
653380 655680 You can choose one tonight.
662172 663614 Where did you get this?
663714 665080 On the shelf.
671714 674489 "If it's in a word or it's in a look,
674589 677422 "you can't get rid of the Babadook.
680255 683738 "If you're a really clever one<br />and you know what it is to see,
683838 686738 "then you can make friends<br />with a special one...
686838 689005 "a friend of you and me."
693215 697115 "His name is Mister Babadook<br />and this is his book.
698256 701823 "A rumbling sound,<br />then three sharp knocks...
702964 705264 "ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!
706507 709448 "That's when you'll know he's around.
709548 711914 "You'll see him if you look.
714589 716955 "Ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!"
718507 720364 We might read another<br />one tonight, hey?
720464 722830 But you said I could choose.
726880 729380 "This is what he wears on top.
729631 732064 "He's funny, don't you think?
734964 737731 "See him in your room at night..."
739339 741572 Mum? Does it hurt the boy?
743507 744655 Mum?
744755 747389 Does it live under the bed? Mum?
749090 750290 Mummy?
752715 753915 Mummy?!
755590 758323 "How sweetly they sung, telling<br />of the happiness and loveliness
758423 760490 "that lay at the bottom of the ocean
760590 764090 and entreating the sirens<br />not to be afraid."
832466 835566 It's that time of<br />night again. Time...
836092 838450 If that's what the<br />doctor ordered, I...
838550 842250 Oh, yeah. Yeah.<br />That's what the doctor ordered.
855241 856441 Do you...
941553 942701 Mum!
942801 944535 - It's in my room!<br />- What is?
944635 946327 - The Babadook!<br />- Oh, no.
946427 949660 No, no, no. This is<br />not going to happen.
951135 953785 The closet doors were closed<br />and now they're wide open.
953885 955518 It's just a book.
955885 957585 It can't hurt you.
958262 960162 You've had a big day.
961010 962977 You're just exhausted.
964884 968651 I don't want anything bad<br />to happen to you, Mum.
970592 973426 Nothing bad's going to happen, Sam.
974093 976060 I'm gonna protect you.
1046719 1048219 Mum, it's 9:00.
1060469 1062495 He's not running a fever anymore.
1062595 1066629 No, no, no. My sister's<br />gonna take him. Put it back!
1066970 1069737 Put it back or it goes in the bin.
1070053 1071953 Sorry. What was that?
1072054 1075495 Oh, no. I couldn't get to<br />the phone. He was vomiting.
1075595 1078370 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />No worries. I'll see you soon.
1078470 1082104 Samuel, no monster talk<br />at Aunty Claire's, OK?
1083054 1086487 Samuel... no Babadook.<br />No nothing. Alright?
1094847 1096280 88. Number 88.
1097470 1098970 Two fat ladies.
1099388 1100754 Good, Elaine!
1101012 1105112 Another few days and someone<br />could call out, "Bingo!"
1107139 1108339 Number 11.
1108470 1110121 Who has number 11?
1110221 1111421 Legs 11.
1112305 1114738 Hey? See what else we've got.
1117471 1118671 5 billion.
1119471 1121371 Anyone got 5 billion?
1132971 1137071 Beverley's not very impressed<br />with your bingo skills.
1138846 1141330 - Are you alright?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
1141430 1144080 No, I'm fine. How are you?<br />How's D wing?
1144180 1147346 Fine. Yeah. Just a<br />bunch of old people.
1150015 1152788 You don't have to be fine, you know.
1152888 1155655 Just a bit stressed at the moment.
1156306 1158272 Why don't you go home?
1159264 1162564 Old cranky bitch...<br />she goes after lunch.
1162723 1163538 I can cover for you.
1163638 1165805 - You'd do that?<br />- Yeah.
1168015 1169872 I'll give you my pay.
1169972 1171789 Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.
1171889 1173856 You've got a sick boy.
1174181 1175814 Life's too short.
1176056 1178156 You're so sweet, Robbie.
1180139 1182305 - You should go.<br />- Yeah.
1182472 1185239 - Say hi to Sam for me.<br />- I will.
1236347 1239647 Where have you been?<br />You weren't at work.
1239806 1240956 Rung you a million times.
1241056 1241998 What happened?
1242098 1244081 Just scared the crap<br />out of Ruby. That's all.
1244181 1247247 He insisted on talking to this<br />bloody Babadook thing all day.
1247347 1249499 Just talking to the air...<br />even freaked me out.
1249599 1250539 I'm so sorry.
1250639 1251998 You need to get him to<br />see someone, Amelia.
1252098 1253916 It's not normal for a kid to<br />carry on with this rubbish.
1254016 1255373 It's not rubbish. It's real!
1255473 1259107 Don't you talk to your<br />Aunty Claire like that.
1260307 1261916 Where did you get those firecrackers?
1262016 1263832 You got them for me on the internet.
1263932 1266898 Well, that's the end of the internet.
1267681 1270456 If the Babadook was real,<br />we'd see it right now, wouldn't we?
1270556 1274082 It wants to scare you<br />first then you'll see it.
1274182 1275916 Well, I'm not scared.
1276016 1279041 You will be when it creeps<br />into your room at night.
1279141 1280574 That's enough.
1280807 1283290 You will be when it<br />eats your insides.
1283390 1285999 I've decided you're not having<br />your birthday with Ruby this week.
1286099 1289332 No cake, no games.<br />That's the end of it.
1292473 1293673 Samuel.
1303432 1306199 Ladies and gentlemen, Mum and Dad,
1307516 1310083 life is not always as it seems.
1310184 1312484 It can be a wondrous thing.
1313432 1316332 But it can also be very treacherous.
1325892 1328525 Don't worry, Dad. I'll save Mum.
1329224 1332324 I'm gonna trap the<br />Babadook like this.
1335142 1338249 And when it's trapped,<br />I'm gonna kill it.
1338349 1339549 Samuel.
1349767 1351542 I was just putting something back.
1351642 1354000 - All your father's things are down there.<br />- He's my father.
1354100 1355800 You don't own him!
1357934 1361034 Just thought I'd see<br />how you're going.
1363642 1365075 Can I come in?
1366308 1368675 Hey, matey. This is for you.
1369433 1372125 My mum always got me a model<br />plane when I was sick.
1372225 1373592 I'm not sick.
1375350 1377050 Oh. I-I thought...
1377684 1379250 No, he's not, actually.
1379350 1382334 The truth is he's so disobedient<br />he can't go to school anymore.
1382434 1383377 You said that's not true.
1383477 1384918 How many 6-year-old boys<br />do you know, Robbie,
1385018 1387050 - who still believe in monsters?<br />- I hate you!
1387150 1392450 She won't let me have a birthday party<br />and she won't let me have a dad!
1465478 1466845 Don't eat it.
1479727 1481893 The Babadook did it, Mum.
1483310 1484794 Go and watch a DVD and<br />I'll make something else.
1484894 1488127 - The Babadook did it!<br />- Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.
1488227 1491194 Ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys,
1492977 1497010 welcome to the great Martin's<br />DVD 'School of Magic'.
1498435 1501002 Life is not always as it seems.
1501519 1503819 It can be a wondrous thing.
1505645 1508545 But it can also be very treacherous.
1509686 1510986 In this DVD,
1512019 1515986 you will learn magic tricks<br />to surprise, to delight
1516645 1520345 and perhaps even shock<br />your family and friends.
1545646 1547946 Do you think this is funny?
1548770 1550270 Oh, no. No. No!
1553729 1555162 Give it to me!
1556938 1558571 Do you wanna die?
1632021 1634505 Don't let it in! Don't let it in!
1634605 1638213 Don't let it in! Don't let it in!<br />Don't let it in!
1638313 1639880 Don't let it in!
1710898 1713998 Mum, do we have to<br />go to Ruby's party?
1724690 1727132 I've already got this doll, Mum.
1727232 1728465 Now she's got a twin.
1728565 1731065 They can go shopping together.
1734256 1735489 Off you go.
1737023 1739057 He's just really tired.
1744232 1746199 Go and play right now.
1753232 1755798 Claire tells me you're a writer.
1755898 1758507 Oh, no, not really. Not anymore.
1758607 1761008 What kind of writing did you do?
1761108 1764965 I wrote some articles for some<br />magazines, did some kids' stuff.
1765065 1767382 You just need to get<br />back into it. That's all.
1767482 1768840 It must be difficult.
1768940 1772300 I do volunteer work with<br />some disadvantaged women
1772400 1775049 and a few of them have<br />lost their husbands
1775149 1777449 and they find it very hard.
1779691 1781257 How's Richard's merger going?
1781357 1785124 Oh, good. I mean,<br />his workload's just ballooned.
1785608 1788300 I've got the kids 24/7,<br />it feels like.
1788400 1789466 Tell me about it!
1789566 1791799 I don't even have time to go to<br />the gym anymore. It's ridiculous!
1791899 1793425 That's a real tragedy.
1793525 1796757 Not having time to go to the<br />gym anymore. How do you cope?
1796857 1798841 You must have so much to talk about
1798941 1801841 with those poor disadvantaged women.
1812024 1815632 This is my tree house.<br />You're not allowed in here.
1815732 1817832 I'm not hurting anybody.
1819732 1820932 Bye.
1823525 1825358 - Thanks.<br />- Thanks.
1831525 1833383 How would your mum<br />know if it's real or not?
1833483 1835425 She never comes to our house.
1835525 1837925 Mum told Dad she didn't<br />want to go to your house
1838025 1839800 'cause it's too depressing.
1839900 1842800 The Babadook would eat<br />your mum for breakfast.
1842900 1845342 - It'd rip her arms off.<br />- Shut up!
1845442 1848550 They feel sorry for me, Claire.<br />There's a big difference.
1848650 1850967 God, Amelia, as soon as anyone<br />mentions Oskar, you can't cope.
1851067 1853550 - That's not true.<br />- It'll be seven years.
1853650 1855010 Isn't it time you moved on?
1855110 1856550 I have moved on.
1856650 1860010 I don't mention him.<br />I don't talk about him.
1860110 1862134 What strain is that on you, Claire?
1862234 1864925 You're not even good<br />enough to have a dad.
1865025 1866967 Everyone else has one and you don't.
1867067 1868634 I do have a dad!
1868734 1871509 I listen to your life<br />day in, day out,
1871609 1874593 and you never stop to ask<br />me anything about mine.
1874693 1877252 I do! I want to know how you are.
1877352 1879259 You don't come round<br />to our house anymore.
1879359 1881468 Because I can't stand<br />being around your son.
1881568 1884093 I can't believe you just said that.
1884193 1886634 You can't stand being<br />around him yourself.
1886734 1889134 Your dad died so he didn't<br />have to be with you.
1889234 1892542 - That's not true!<br />- And your mum doesn't want you.
1892642 1894276 No-one wants you.
1905360 1906469 What did you do?!
1906569 1910402 She said I didn't have a dad.<br />She kept saying it.
1910860 1912360 Is she alright?
1912485 1917892 Stay here and look after the children<br />or do you want another one to get hurt?
1917992 1920559 Mummy! She wouldn't believe me!
1922278 1923644 Mummy! Mummy!
1924776 1925976 Mummy!
1926694 1930461 - Mummy! Mummy!<br />- Why can't you just be normal?!
1932278 1934178 There is no Babadook!
1936319 1937519 Get out!
1941236 1943136 - Get out!<br />- Samuel?
1943902 1946052 - Mummy!<br />- Stop this now!
1946152 1948385 Get out! Get out! Get out!
1968195 1969345 Please help me!
1969445 1972345 There's something wrong with my son.
1983486 1986593 I think it may have been<br />a febrile convulsi�n.
1986693 1988469 That's when the brain overheats.
1988569 1991677 - It always looks worse than it is.<br />- I've never seen anything like this.
1991777 1993761 We'll have to wait until<br />the tests come back.
1993861 1995552 All his other results are normal.
1995652 1999486 He's obviously suffering<br />a high level of anxiety.
1999819 2001470 Very committed to the monster theory.
2001570 2003737 That's an understatement.
2004069 2006302 All children see monsters.
2006694 2008128 Not like this.
2009777 2011762 And it's getting worse.
2011862 2014029 He's becoming aggressive.
2014570 2016054 He could see a psychiatrist.
2016154 2017678 I can refer you.
2017778 2019261 Takes a few weeks to get in.
2019361 2020927 That'd be great.
2022486 2025719 But can you just give<br />me something for now,
2025819 2027852 just to make him sleep?
2029403 2030769 Just until...
2032320 2035020 just until we get an appointment.
2035694 2036894 Please?
2037862 2041562 I haven't slept in weeks<br />and neither has Samuel
2042653 2045970 and when we go home tonight, this<br />whole nightmare will start up again
2046070 2047220 and I am really...
2047320 2049286 I'm really not coping.
2052446 2055880 I can give you a short<br />course of sedatives.
2057070 2059386 Just until the tests come back.
2059486 2064053 Most mothers aren't too keen<br />on them unless it's really bad.
2064362 2065928 It's really bad.
2073571 2076405 These can make children feel foggy.
2078155 2080305 Perhaps some temporary nausea.
2080405 2083512 They'll certainly help<br />him sleep, though.
2083612 2086512 - That's for one week.<br />- Thank you.
2089321 2091487 Why don't people like me?
2091696 2093530 Why do you say that?
2093779 2097546 Ruby said people don't<br />like me 'cause I'm weird.
2098946 2102513 Sometimes people say<br />things that aren't true.
2106488 2111588 You just need to take your medicine,<br />have a big sleep and not worry.
2113447 2115138 I don't want you to die.
2115238 2118264 I'm not gonna die<br />for a long time yet.
2118364 2122064 Did you think that about<br />my dad before he died?
2126739 2130172 Just take your pill so<br />you can go to sleep.
2130364 2132597 I've got the day off tomorrow.
2132697 2134639 Maybe we could do something?
2134739 2137706 Will these make the Babadook go away?
2138114 2141597 I think so but you have to promise<br />me not to mention it again.
2141697 2145640 I promise to protect you if<br />you promise to protect me.
2145740 2147472 Then I won't mention it.
2147572 2149739 I promise to protect you.
2151906 2153106 Come on.
2164864 2166064 Come on.
2172531 2174765 Can you stay here with me?
2175032 2176232 Yes.
2176948 2178515 I love you, Mum.
2179282 2180482 Me too.
2363284 2365518 Her nose is broken in two places.
2365618 2367726 - She may need surgery.<br />- I'll pay for everything.
2367826 2369476 You can't even pay your own bills.
2369576 2370851 Look, I really have to go.
2370951 2374643 Claire, I think someone is<br />stalking me and Samuel.
2374743 2375943 What?
2376118 2378059 A book turned up at our place.
2378159 2381686 I threw it away but somebody<br />glued it back together
2381786 2383476 and put it on our doorstep.
2383576 2386809 Amelia, I just can't<br />help you right now.
2386993 2389852 I don't expect you to help.<br />I just wanted...
2389952 2392102 If you're that worried,<br />you should go to the police.
2392202 2393569 I have to go.
2413744 2414944 Claire!
2417327 2418527 Hello?
2420368 2421602 Babadook...
2424869 2426235 dook... dook.
2435369 2436569 Hi.
2438285 2442144 I want to report someone<br />stalking me and my child.
2442244 2443477 Can you tell us what happened?
2443577 2446410 Somebody sent me a children's book.
2448244 2449444 And?
2450619 2453687 And it contained violent<br />and graphic images
2453787 2455728 of my child and me being murdered.
2455828 2457728 Can we have a look<br />at the book, please?
2457828 2459061 I burnt it.
2460078 2461445 You burnt it?
2462787 2463812 Yes.
2463912 2468144 Well, unfortunately,<br />there's nothing we can do about it.
2468244 2471678 He's been making phone<br />calls to me as well.
2472079 2473271 What's he been saying?
2473371 2476338 Nothing, just making these... noises.
2477036 2478770 How do you know it's the same person?
2478870 2481227 Because of what he wrote in the book.
2481327 2482978 The book you burnt?
2483078 2484278 Yes.
2501578 2502778 OK.
2504286 2506186 Don't worry about it.
2515953 2517979 Did you get your things done?
2518079 2520144 Mrs Roach has Parkinson's.
2520244 2521936 That's why she shakes like this.
2522036 2524936 Samuel, you don't have to say<br />everything that goes through your head.
2525036 2527070 Oh, it's alright, love.
2527620 2530853 He wanted to know so<br />we talked about it.
2532620 2535186 He sees things as they are, that one.
2535286 2536895 Oskar was the same.
2536995 2538604 He always spoke his mind.
2538704 2541870 Do you have to keep<br />on bringing him up?
2547579 2548812 Hey, Bugsy.
2550878 2552078 Hey.
2552920 2554120 Hey!
2620248 2622015 Don't come in here.
2634913 2637230 I don't want to buy anything.
2637330 2639297 Are you Amelia Vanick?
2639414 2640356 Yes.
2640456 2642939 I'm Warren Newton and<br />this is Prue Flannery
2643039 2644731 from the Department<br />of Community Services.
2644831 2646772 My son's only been away for two days.
2646872 2650314 He's not actually registered<br />at Babbage Bay anymore.
2650414 2652523 If I could just come<br />in and meet Samuel
2652623 2655690 and get you to look at<br />these papers, that'd be great.
2655790 2660490 I'm just in the middle of cleaning<br />up the house at the moment.
2660872 2663772 I'm sorry. There's stuff everywhere.
2667456 2668889 Hello, Samuel.
2669832 2672199 I'm Prue and this is Warren.
2675331 2676631 How are you?
2676873 2680307 I'm a bit tired from<br />the drugs Mum gave me.
2680582 2684148 Not drugs. Tranquillisers...<br />from the doctor.
2684665 2686441 He had a fit yesterday.
2686541 2688841 I'm really tired, actually.
2689957 2691457 That's no good.
2694541 2696607 May I have a glass of water, please?
2696707 2699407 Yes. Of course. I'll get you one.
2707915 2709549 It's a real mess.
2709915 2712232 I just found this<br />cockroach infestation.
2712332 2713773 I normally have the house sprayed.
2713873 2715649 I did actually already<br />have it sprayed
2715749 2718482 but there's this hole in<br />the wall behind the fridge
2718582 2720348 and that's why I...
2725082 2727650 I didn't mean a hole in the wall.
2727750 2730150 There was a hole in the wallpaper.
2730250 2732442 That's where they were<br />laying their eggs, I think.
2732542 2735108 We've caught you at a bad time.
2735998 2737607 I'll leave you with this.
2737707 2742024 We're required to come back in a<br />week to talk through your options.
2742124 2743624 Here's my card.
2745582 2748015 Mum, I think I'm gonna vomit.
2769790 2774157 - What was that noise I heard?<br />- I didn't hear any noise.
2775207 2777399 Wind howling, doors slamming.
2777499 2780732 I declare, I think this house is haunted.
2780999 2783166 Mum, I'm gonna go to bed.
2784749 2786116 Are you sick?
2786749 2788249 Oh, no, Granny.
2789666 2791166 It's only 6:00.
2791749 2794400 Don't you want to stay up<br />with your mum for a while?
2794500 2795700 No.
2795958 2799992 If you go to bed now,<br />the pills won't work properly.
2802458 2805958 You have to stay up<br />for a while, sweetheart.
2821042 2824908 Where's its mother, Skip?<br />Koalas don't leave their babies about.
2825008 2828058 - Are you off now, Dad?<br />- Yep. Soon as I fuel up.
2828158 2830318 Tell Jerry I'll keep<br />in touch on the radio
2830418 2834067 and I'll be back before breakfast<br />the day after tomorrow.
2834167 2836359 "And the Prince and the Princess
2836459 2839318 "lived happily together<br />in a beautiful palace
2839418 2841851 "for the rest of their days."
2944545 2945778 Babadook...
2948296 2949662 dook... dook.
2986586 2988286 What are we doing?
2989169 2990904 We're going downstairs.
2991004 2993171 - Why?<br />- Because we are.
3012171 3013804 Iris, Iris, Iris.
3015128 3016328 No.
3066504 3068238 Glass and mirror attachment.
3068338 3071780 Clean and polish shower doors or<br />mirrors for a streak-free shine.
3071880 3074988 As part of your steaming special, we'll<br />even include the garment and upholst...
3075088 3078721 Oh, I don't want to give<br />it to anyone at work.
3080338 3084771 Alright. Give all my shifts away.<br />That's just what I need.
3086629 3087905 I can't help it if I'm sick.
3088005 3090372 What do you expect me to do?
3090629 3091929 You do that!
3106672 3110172 Mum, I took the pills<br />but I feel sick again.
3113130 3115230 I need to eat something.
3120005 3123172 I couldn't find any<br />food in the fridge.
3125505 3128139 You said to have them with food.
3128797 3130830 I'm really hungry, Mum.
3132757 3136257 Why do you have to<br />keep talk, talk, talking?
3136881 3138714 Don't you ever stop?
3138839 3141672 - I was just...<br />- I need to sleep!
3142465 3145864 I'm sorry, Mummy.<br />I was just really hungry.
3145964 3150064 If you're that hungry,<br />why don't you go and eat shit?
3183715 3185082 I'm so sorry.
3185381 3189015 I don't know why I said that.<br />It was terrible.
3189798 3192231 I've had absolutely no sleep.
3193423 3196057 I didn't know what I was saying.
3197590 3200024 I'll cook you something. Hey?
3200882 3202116 What would you like?
3202216 3204249 I'm not hungry anymore.
3211216 3213033 We really need to get<br />out of this house.
3213133 3217366 We've been cooped up here<br />too long. That's the problem.
3220424 3222858 Do you want to go to Wally's?
3223424 3225866 You can have anything<br />you want. Alright?
3225966 3229266 Even ice-cream for<br />breakfast if you like.
3232051 3234351 Give it back! Give it back!
3235217 3238183 - Stop it! Sit down. Sit down.<br />- No!
3239298 3241156 - Now!<br />- Give my drink back!
3241256 3242890 Sit down, please.
3248882 3250032 Where are we going?
3250132 3253365 I just want to drive<br />for a little while.
3267257 3268624 Mummy! Mummy!
3271633 3272833 Babadook.
3284434 3286075 You ran straight into me!
3286175 3290341 I just bought this bloody car.<br />What were you thinking?
3291342 3294324 Oh, driving on the wrong side<br />of the road with a kid in the back.
3294424 3296791 You could've killed someone!
3297881 3301581 Hey! Hey, what are you doing?<br />Hey! Crazy bitch!
3308884 3310384 Hi, sweetheart.
3319383 3320583 Mum?
3322467 3324567 I can call Aunty Claire.
3327842 3330542 I can call and she can come over.
3334300 3335500 Mum?
3335759 3339526 Aunty Claire doesn't want<br />to talk to us anymore.
3341884 3343784 Mum. Mum, look at me.
3371259 3373559 It's nice and warm in here.
3377468 3379835 I don't want you to go away.
3381843 3383876 I'm not going anywhere.
3396427 3397627 Mum?
3405469 3409169 Mum, I don't think we<br />should stay here tonight.
3411053 3412953 I can call Mrs Roach.
3413220 3415854 I don't want you to call anyone.
3419969 3421869 I just need to sleep.
3426678 3428578 - Mum...<br />- Leave it!
3460136 3462703 There's something in the house.
3476805 3479238 There's someone in the house!
3534012 3537312 Mrs Roach can we come<br />and stay the night?
3547220 3549120 Gracie, I'm so sorry.
3549221 3551538 Has someone broken into the house?
3551638 3554621 - Sam said that...<br />- No, no, no. We're fine.
3554721 3556538 Samuel's just being<br />very disobedient again.
3556638 3558538 Oh, I was so worried.
3558930 3560371 I told him not to call anyone.
3560471 3562289 He asked if you could stay the night.
3562389 3565121 No, no, no. We're fine. I just<br />have a headache. That's all.
3565221 3568521 I really have to go,<br />though, now, Gracie.
3568763 3570246 I'm so sorry for troubling you.
3570346 3571829 Yes. Talk soon.
3571929 3573896 No worries. Talk soon.
3576054 3580888 I told you not to call anyone and<br />you deliberately disobeyed me.
3581722 3583829 Do you want to frighten Mrs Roach?
3583929 3586038 An old lady who can hardly walk?
3586138 3588572 Do you want to make her sick?
3589555 3591788 Get that bloody thing off!
3595847 3600147 Is this the only way I can<br />trust you not to embarrass me
3600972 3603272 in front of our neighbours?
3607180 3609414 Is this what I have to do?
3620390 3621456 I'm sorry, Mummy.
3621556 3623706 It's just that the Babadook made<br />you crash the car and then...
3623806 3625306 What'd you say?
3625806 3627372 I said the Babadook...
3627472 3628997 The Babadook isn't real, Samuel.
3629097 3632830 He's just something you've made<br />up in your stupid little head.
3632930 3635373 I just didn't want you to let it in!
3635473 3638640 I'll make sure nothing<br />gets in tonight.
3639181 3640665 Alright, Samuel?
3640765 3643206 Nothing is coming in here tonight.
3643306 3644506 Nothing!
3682015 3683315 I feel sick.
3684474 3688107 If you don't take the pill,<br />you'll feel worse.
3688849 3690374 Mum, I don't think I need...
3690474 3694707 I am the parent and you are<br />the child so take the pill.
3716974 3718174 Good boy.
3741850 3743050 Mum!
3760349 3762516 Hey, Bugsy. Hey, sweetie.
3766057 3768157 Come here, sweetie. Hey?
3769683 3770883 Hey.
3772142 3773342 Hey!
3794600 3795833 Here we go.
3802183 3804950 There's more where that came from.
3822934 3824634 What's the secret?
3826767 3829917 - ...letter of Max's, didn't you?<br />- No, not for a minute.
3830017 3831792 Don't lie. You called<br />me a jezebel. Why?
3831892 3834001 - The north, east.<br />- Natural corset.
3834101 3835668 With fresh meat.
3837892 3839192 Only five...
3840210 3844243 You don't wanna go in there<br />all by yourself, do you?
3844602 3849001 Police say the woman used a<br />kitchen knife to stab her son.
3849101 3851168 His body was found in their basement.
3851268 3853919 The woman later attacked<br />officers with a knife.
3854019 3857452 They drew their guns<br />and shot her to death.
3858268 3860126 Little is known about the tragedy
3860226 3864085 but neighbours say the boy was<br />celebrating his birthday today.
3864185 3866352 He had just turned seven.
3880977 3882177 Samuel?
3886852 3888352 Wake up, Mummy.
3891352 3894852 But you're the one<br />who's asleep, sweetheart.
3900144 3901977 Don't go down there.
3906602 3908036 It's not safe.
3945145 3947245 I thought you were dead.
3949437 3951537 I thought you were dead.
3966437 3968537 We're gonna be together.
3971104 3973871 You just need to bring me the boy.
3995854 3997421 You mean Samuel?
3998354 4000520 You can bring me the boy.
4003313 4005479 You can bring me the boy.
4006978 4008461 You can bring me the boy.
4008561 4009878 Stop calling him 'the boy'.
4009978 4012088 I think it's going to rain.
4012188 4013388 No.
4105438 4108938 It isn't real. It isn't real.<br />It isn't real.
4120731 4121931 Oh, no.
4128439 4129639 No! No!
4138315 4139515 Bugsy!
4251482 4252682 Samuel!
4258608 4259808 Samuel.
4261942 4264908 Bugsy's hurt and we need to get help.
4268733 4271500 You don't want him to die, do you?
4275192 4276392 Samuel.
4276983 4279083 Are you listening to me?
4283943 4286243 Let me in, you little shit!
4286400 4287600 Let me in!
4288859 4290051 Let me in!
4290151 4291351 Let me in!
4291692 4292892 Let me in!
4316944 4318444 You little pig!
4319192 4322926 Six years old and you're<br />still wetting yourself.
4323026 4325092 You don't know how many times
4325192 4328426 I wished it was you,<br />not him, that died.
4329110 4330759 I just want you to be happy.
4330859 4333359 "I just want you to be happy."
4337317 4338617 Sometimes...
4338860 4342593 I just wanna smash your<br />head against a brick wall
4342693 4345460 until your fucking brains pop out.
4345944 4347844 You're not my mother.
4348027 4351927 - What did you say?<br />- I said you're not my mother!
4352235 4353869 I am your mother!
4357653 4360420 Run, run, run, as fast as you can!
4364777 4365977 Get away!
4366151 4369585 Didn't I tell you not<br />to play with weapons?
4417028 4419794 I'm sorry, love. I know it's late.
4420028 4422094 I just wanted to make<br />sure you were OK.
4422194 4423394 I'm OK.
4425194 4429228 I know... this time of year's<br />terribly hard for you.
4431112 4435303 And I know you don't want me<br />to go on about it, so I won't.
4435403 4440436 But I just wanted you to know that<br />I'd do anything for you and Sam.
4440612 4442179 I love you both.
4445945 4447145 Samuel.
4450570 4451770 I'm sorry.
4455153 4456970 I understand you're scared.
4457070 4460304 I haven't been good<br />since your dad died.
4461070 4463370 I haven't been good at all.
4466946 4469246 I'm sick, Sam. I need help.
4474696 4477062 I just spoke with Mrs Roach.
4480321 4482722 We're going to stay there tonight.
4482822 4484455 Do you want that?
4490196 4492896 I want to make it up to you, Sam.
4504405 4506772 I want you to meet your dad.
4508237 4510137 It's beautiful there.
4512405 4513972 You'll be happy.
4521612 4522979 Sorry, Mummy!
4571698 4572898 Mum!
4573822 4575022 Mum!
4576089 4577923 I'm not leaving you.
4581614 4582814 Mum? Mum?
4591447 4594147 You said we'd protect each other.
4600197 4602364 I know you don't love me.
4603947 4606097 The Babadook won't let you.
4606197 4608031 But I love you, Mum.
4609947 4611647 And I always will.
4621823 4624923 You let it in.<br />You have to get it out!
4630073 4632440 I don't want you to go away.
4632906 4634140 No! No! No!
4634490 4635690 Mummy!
4686699 4687899 Mummy!
4688199 4689399 Mummy!
4690284 4691484 Mummy!
4692241 4693608 Mummy! Mummy!
4694700 4695900 Mummy!
4696867 4698067 Mummy!
4736285 4737518 What is it?
4737701 4740467 You can't get rid of the Babadook.
4770033 4771667 What do you want?
4774825 4776459 What do you want?
4814409 4815609 No.
4816160 4817660 Keep breathing.
4822410 4827243 Put your seat back, sweetheart.<br />10 more minutes and we're there.
4829951 4831151 No.
4836784 4838101 I think it's gonna rain.
4838201 4839401 Stop!
4888369 4889935 You are nothing.
4902953 4904453 You're nothing!
4913745 4915379 This is my house!
4920329 4922962 You are trespassing in my house!
4933412 4937178 If you touch my son again<br />I'll fucking kill you!
4946995 4948195 No!
4992914 4994281 Mummy, don't!
5000288 5001488 Don't!
5108373 5110856 Watch out for your<br />mum's leg, little one.
5110956 5112856 He's fine. I've had the stitches out.
5112956 5114690 What time's the party?
5114790 5116023 Any time after three is fine.
5116123 5117940 I'll see you in a few hours, then.
5118040 5119240 Bye.
5119623 5120823 Bye, Sam.
5121414 5123691 That school's a good choice.
5123791 5127565 I've been doing a lot of reading about<br />it so I think Sam will be happy there.
5127665 5131314 He's been out of school over two<br />weeks now. It's time to get back.
5131414 5134981 We needed some time to<br />sort a few things out.
5136165 5137898 Are you having a party?
5137998 5139648 It's Sam's birthday today.
5139748 5142915 My first birthday<br />I've ever celebrated.
5143083 5144482 That's not true.
5144582 5147108 Yes, it is. My first<br />party on the day.
5147208 5148708 That's unusual.
5151915 5155233 My husband died the<br />day that Sam was born.
5155333 5159433 He got killed driving Mum<br />to the hospital to have me.
5160707 5162692 Sam's just like his dad was.
5162792 5164816 Always speaks his mind.
5164916 5169149 Well, parties are lots of fun,<br />especially when they're yours.
5169249 5173949 My cousin's not coming because<br />I broke her nose in two places.
5176415 5178449 I'll take that for you.
5197916 5199116 Good shot.
5199292 5201483 Look, there's another one!
5201583 5203283 Where's your bowl?
5206625 5208992 Wow. You've got a lot today.
5211416 5213400 Am I ever gonna see it?
5213500 5215867 One day, when you're bigger.
5222625 5226858 You go outside, and you<br />don't come in until I tell you.
5271333 5273633 It's alright. It's alright.
5275250 5276617 It's alright.
5311709 5312942 How was it?
5313417 5315651 It was pretty quiet today.
5317961 5319161 Come here.
5323710 5326210 It's getting much better, Mum.
5330002 5331202 Wait!
5331377 5333144 I have a new trick.
5336961 5339527 Life is not always as it seems.
5339961 5343261 Nothing in my hands.<br />Nothing in my hands.
5348086 5351119 - That's great!<br />- I haven't finished.
5360460 5361760 Abracadabra!
5366168 5368002 How did you do that?
5373253 5375487 Come here, you. Come here.
5386711 5389011 Happy birthday, sweetheart.
