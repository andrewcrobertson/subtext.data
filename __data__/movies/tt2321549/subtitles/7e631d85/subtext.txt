72482 74206 Mum!
89801 91101 Mum!
94081 95692 Mummy!
98521 100211 Mum!
101921 103566 Mum!
104521 106690 I had the dream again.
115641 117701 "And he climbed down that chimney,
117801 120981 "straight into the huge black pot.
121081 124886 "And that was the end<br />of the big, bad wolf."
128761 130941 Did they really kill the wolf, Mum?
131042 133421 I'm sure they did.
133522 135821 I'll kill the monster when it comes.
135921 138204 I'll smash its head in.
140321 142141 It's time to go to<br />sleep now, sweetie.
142241 143621 It's very late.
143721 146731 Can we read it again?
149521 152901 "A long time ago...<br />just yesterday, in fact...
153002 158048 "there were three little pigs<br />and one nasty big wolf."
227001 229781 - What have you done?<br />- It's not broken. It just slipped.
229881 232061 I don't want you firing things<br />off in the house anymore.
232161 235101 Wait, wait, wait. Watch this. When the<br />monster comes, I'm gonna do this.
235201 236562 Please don't!
239881 241101 Nothing in my hands.
241202 243621 - Nothing in my hands.<br />- Stand still, please.
243721 245141 Look at me, Mum!
245241 246341 Come on, Samuel.
246441 248581 - Look at me.<br />- Stand still, please.
248681 250421 Nothing in my hands.<br />Nothing in my hands.
250522 253861 - I don't want you making weapons anymore.<br />- It doesn't work if you don't look at me.
253961 257244 This monster thing has<br />got to stop, alright?
270002 272363 Don't do that!
274761 276373 Ready?
278321 280091 Come on.
284201 285661 Quick. You're late already.
285762 287381 What have you got in there?
287481 289126 See you later, alligator.
298201 300501 Here's one for you, Norma.<br />It's got milk in it.
300601 301621 What?
301721 303501 One with your milk in it.
303602 305301 I don't want milk.
305401 308366 No worries.<br />I'll make you another one.
311801 314421 Just where a woman<br />should be. In the kitchen.
314521 316741 Get to work, woman.
317681 318701 Do you want a cuppa?
318801 321621 Nah. I'm heading for<br />the dementia ward.
321721 324661 Aw. It's a few years before<br />you end up there, isn't it?
325528 326876 Right?
331921 334605 Amelia? Your son's<br />school is on the phone.
339201 342021 Oh, my God. Did he hurt anyone?
342121 344642 A dart could have gone into<br />a child's eye or even worse.
345681 347341 I'm going to have a<br />serious talk with him.
347441 349581 Mrs Fanning, we've had the talks.
349682 351221 We've had the sessions<br />with the counsellor.
351322 355221 We're going to have to<br />employ a monitor for him.
355321 356461 Monitor?
356561 358341 He'll be separated from<br />the other children.
358441 361062 The monitor will supervise<br />him one-on-one.
361161 362381 Samuel won't cope with this.
362481 363781 He already feels so different.
363881 366541 I'll have a talk with him.<br />I'll have a serious talk...
366641 367621 Mrs Fanning,
367721 369982 the boy has significant<br />behavioural problems.
370081 373701 You know, Samuel doesn't<br />need a full-time monitor.
373801 375861 What he needs is some understanding.
375961 378461 I have 24 other first<br />graders in that class.
378561 380861 Do you want me to put them<br />all at risk because of your son?
380962 382421 I think I'll just<br />find another school.
382521 384821 Mrs Fanning, you can't just<br />take the boy out of school.
384921 386781 You look after your business<br />and I'll go and find a school
386881 388502 that sees my son as a human being
388601 390422 and not just as another<br />problem to be gotten rid of.
390521 393302 That is very unfair.<br />We're only trying to help the boy.
393401 395661 Please stop calling him 'the boy'.
395762 398089 His name is Samuel.
404801 407501 We can see Ruby and Aunty<br />Claire at the park today.
407601 411421 You can play on that swing you<br />like for as long as you like, OK?
411521 414341 Mrs Bruen hates me.
414441 416211 No, she doesn't.
417601 419530 Just need a break, that's all.
421401 423649 Don't tell Aunty<br />Claire what happened.
425161 427421 I'll tell her later.
429242 432650 - Mum, come and look at this!<br />- I can do it again.
434161 435701 Sam, don't bother the lady.
435801 437261 No, no, no. That's alright.
437361 439061 We have to go home and see Daddy,<br />though, haven't we?
439161 440622 My dad's in the cemetery.
440721 441781 Oh. That's...
441881 444661 He got killed driving Mum<br />to the hospital to have me.
444761 447261 Samuel.
447361 448621 I'm sorry. He just...
448722 451381 No, that's alright.<br />I shouldn't have...
451481 454381 Well, your mum is very lucky<br />to have you, then, isn't she?
454482 456101 We have to go.
456201 458529 - Say, "See you later," Katie.<br />- Bye.
459441 461181 The artist was so drunk, he vomited.
461281 462781 Right in front of his<br />own installation.
462881 464701 Lost all these sales.
464801 466661 You're not listening.
466761 468342 I am. I am.
468441 471342 So you lost all these sales<br />and then what happened?
471441 473262 Ruby! Don't play there. It's wet.
473361 475742 Mum! Mum!
475841 478772 I'm gonna smash its head!
480881 483892 - Be careful.<br />- Mum, Mum! I'm gonna smash it.
486601 488701 What would you like me<br />to do for Wednesday?
488801 492050 I can get their birthday cakes.<br />That's easy.
493601 496168 I was hoping Ruby would<br />change her mind.
497481 499821 She doesn't want a joint<br />party with Sam this year.
499921 502981 - Oh.<br />- Mum! Mum!
503081 504501 She wants to have a princess party.
504601 506661 Mum! Mum!
506761 508102 That's OK.
508201 510261 We don't have to come.
510361 512141 You can still come.
512241 513221 Mum!
513322 515341 She just doesn't want to share<br />the day with Sam anymore.
515441 517341 - I understand. I understand.<br />- Mum!
517442 520850 Mum, I can go really high! Watch.
523681 526661 Maybe you want to celebrate his<br />birthday properly this year, anyway.
526762 528901 - On the day.<br />- Yeah, we'll see.
530121 532501 You know, Amelia,<br />I just want you to be happy
532601 534421 and then this birthday<br />thing rolls around
534521 537088 - and I end up feeling awful.<br />- I don't want you to feel awful, Claire.
538601 539901 We'll be fine.
540001 541022 We'll be absolutely fine.
541121 543005 Mum! Look at me!
548041 550005 Mama!
554921 557741 - Who do we have here?<br />- Hello, Mrs Roach.
557841 559661 You look tired, little one.
559761 561901 Have you been in the wars today?
562002 563261 A few wars.
563361 565821 He's had a big day, that's all.
565921 567381 He's just exhausted.
567481 569142 Poor little sweetheart.
569241 570501 Bugsy.
570601 572181 Come here, little girl. Hello.
572281 574701 You look tired too, love.
574801 576061 You OK?
576161 578181 Nothing five years<br />of sleep wouldn't fix.
579241 580981 I'll put your rubbish<br />out for you, Grace.
581082 583621 No, no, no. You've just got in, pet.
583721 585446 I'll do it now. Then it's done.
623761 625725 You can choose one tonight.
632201 633581 Where did you get this?
633681 635326 On the shelf.
641361 644021 "If it's in a word or it's in a look,
644121 647006 "you can't get rid of the Babadook.
649561 652901 "If you're a really clever one<br />and you know what it is to see,
653001 655781 "then you can make friends<br />with a special one...
655881 657571 "a friend of you and me."
662002 666741 "His name is Mister Babadook<br />and this is his book.
666841 671261 "A rumbling sound,<br />then three sharp knocks...
671361 674661 "ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!
674762 677581 "That's when you'll know he's around.
677681 680123 "You'll see him if you look.
682521 686181 "Ba BA-ba Dook! Dook! Dook!"
686282 688062 We might read another<br />one tonight, hey?
688161 690170 But you said I could choose.
694321 696861 "This is what he wears on top.
696961 699243 "He's funny, don't you think?
702081 704363 "See him in your room at night..."
706281 708404 Mum? Does it hurt the boy?
710282 711382 Mum?
711481 714366 Does it live under the bed? Mum?
715642 717331 Mummy?
719121 720582 Mummy?!
721881 724501 "How sweetly they sung, telling<br />of the happiness and loveliness
724601 726581 "that lay at the bottom of the ocean
726681 729327 and entreating the sirens<br />not to be afraid."
795681 799061 It's that time of<br />night again. Time...
799162 801421 If that's what the<br />doctor ordered, I...
801521 803702 Oh, yeah. Yeah.<br />That's what the doctor ordered.
817544 818886 Do you...
900402 901502 Mum!
901601 903261 - It's in my room!<br />- What is?
903361 904981 - The Babadook!<br />- Oh, no.
905081 909501 No, no, no. This is<br />not going to happen.
909601 912141 The closet doors were closed<br />and now they're wide open.
912241 914061 It's just a book.
914161 916341 It can't hurt you.
916442 918981 You've had a big day.
919081 921807 You're just exhausted.
922801 926370 I don't want anything bad<br />to happen to you, Mum.
928281 931541 Nothing bad's going to happen, Sam.
931641 934287 I'm gonna protect you.
1001361 1004132 Mum, it's 9:00.
1014561 1016501 He's not running a fever anymore.
1016601 1020701 No, no, no. My sister's<br />gonna take him. Put it back!
1020801 1022462 Put it back or it goes in the bin.
1023761 1025581 Sorry. What was that?
1025681 1028981 Oh, no. I couldn't get to<br />the phone. He was vomiting.
1029081 1031741 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />No worries. I'll see you soon.
1031841 1035284 Samuel, no monster talk<br />at Aunty Claire's, OK?
1036241 1040332 Samuel... no Babadook.<br />No nothing. Alright?
1047562 1049981 88. Number 88.
1050081 1051822 Two fat ladies.
1051921 1053381 Good, Elaine!
1053481 1056207 Another few days and someone<br />could call out, "Bingo!"
1059362 1060541 Number 11.
1060641 1062221 Who has number 11?
1062321 1064221 Legs 11.
1064321 1067253 Hey? See what else we've got.
1069281 1071101 5 billion.
1071201 1073722 Anyone got 5 billion?
1084161 1087013 Beverley's not very impressed<br />with your bingo skills.
1089801 1092181 - Are you alright?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
1092282 1094821 No, I'm fine. How are you?<br />How's D wing?
1094921 1098205 Fine. Yeah. Just a<br />bunch of old people.
1100522 1103181 You don't have to be fine, you know.
1103281 1106461 Just a bit stressed at the moment.
1106561 1108525 Why don't you go home?
1109401 1112621 Old cranky bitch...<br />she goes after lunch.
1112722 1113501 I can cover for you.
1113601 1116328 - You'd do that?<br />- Yeah.
1117802 1119582 I'll give you my pay.
1119681 1121421 Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.
1121521 1123621 You've got a sick boy.
1123721 1125421 Life's too short.
1125521 1128181 You're so sweet, Robbie.
1129441 1131581 - You should go.<br />- Yeah.
1131681 1134965 - Say hi to Sam for me.<br />- I will.
1183401 1186621 Where have you been?<br />You weren't at work.
1186721 1187821 Rung you a million times.
1187921 1188821 What happened?
1188921 1190821 Just scared the crap<br />out of Ruby. That's all.
1190921 1193861 He insisted on talking to this<br />bloody Babadook thing all day.
1193961 1196021 Just talking to the air...<br />even freaked me out.
1196122 1197021 I'm so sorry.
1197121 1198421 You need to get him to<br />see someone, Amelia.
1198521 1200261 It's not normal for a kid to<br />carry on with this rubbish.
1200362 1201661 It's not rubbish. It's real!
1201761 1204009 Don't you talk to your<br />Aunty Claire like that.
1206402 1207941 Where did you get those firecrackers?
1208042 1209781 You got them for me on the internet.
1209881 1211446 Well, that's the end of the internet.
1213481 1216142 If the Babadook was real,<br />we'd see it right now, wouldn't we?
1216241 1219621 It wants to scare you<br />first then you'll see it.
1219721 1221381 Well, I'm not scared.
1221482 1224382 You will be when it creeps<br />into your room at night.
1224481 1225981 That's enough.
1226081 1228461 You will be when it<br />eats your insides.
1228561 1231061 I've decided you're not having<br />your birthday with Ruby this week.
1231161 1233011 No cake, no games.<br />That's the end of it.
1237281 1238661 Samuel.
1247801 1251621 Ladies and gentlemen, Mum and Dad,
1251721 1254181 life is not always as it seems.
1254282 1257301 It can be a wondrous thing.
1257401 1261846 But it can also be very treacherous.
1269362 1272461 Don't worry, Dad. I'll save Mum.
1272561 1275651 I'm gonna trap the<br />Babadook like this.
1278241 1281221 And when it's trapped,<br />I'm gonna kill it.
1281321 1283523 Samuel.
1292281 1293981 I was just putting something back.
1294081 1296341 - All your father's things are down there.<br />- He's my father.
1296441 1298018 You don't own him!
1300121 1302483 Just thought I'd see<br />how you're going.
1305601 1307087 Can I come in?
1308161 1311062 Hey, matey. This is for you.
1311161 1313741 My mum always got me a model<br />plane when I was sick.
1313841 1315487 I'm not sick.
1316841 1318981 Oh. I-I thought...
1319081 1320581 No, he's not, actually.
1320681 1323542 The truth is he's so disobedient<br />he can't go to school anymore.
1323641 1324541 You said that's not true.
1324642 1326021 How many 6-year-old boys<br />do you know, Robbie,
1326121 1328069 - who still believe in monsters?<br />- I hate you!
1328169 1332582 She won't let me have a birthday party<br />and she won't let me have a dad!
1403362 1404767 Don't eat it.
1417041 1419084 The Babadook did it, Mum.
1420481 1421901 Go and watch a DVD and<br />I'll make something else.
1422001 1425101 - The Babadook did it!<br />- Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.
1425201 1429661 Ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys,
1429761 1434901 welcome to the great Martin's<br />DVD 'School of Magic'.
1435001 1437861 Life is not always as it seems.
1437961 1441821 It can be a wondrous thing.
1441922 1445701 But it can also be very treacherous.
1445801 1447942 In this DVD,
1448041 1452381 you will learn magic tricks<br />to surprise, to delight
1452482 1458085 and perhaps even shock<br />your family and friends.
1480322 1482205 Do you think this is funny?
1483321 1486331 Oh, no. No. No!
1488081 1489581 Give it to me!
1491162 1493932 Do you wanna die?
1563241 1565622 Don't let it in! Don't let it in!
1565721 1569181 Don't let it in! Don't let it in!<br />Don't let it in!
1569281 1571210 Don't let it in!
1638961 1642449 Mum, do we have to<br />go to Ruby's party?
1652201 1654541 I've already got this doll, Mum.
1654642 1655821 Now she's got a twin.
1655921 1657282 They can go shopping together.
1661385 1662582 Off you go.
1664041 1666221 He's just really tired.
1670962 1673562 Go and play right now.
1679602 1682061 Claire tells me you're a writer.
1682161 1684661 Oh, no, not really. Not anymore.
1684761 1687061 What kind of writing did you do?
1687162 1690862 I wrote some articles for some<br />magazines, did some kids' stuff.
1690961 1693182 You just need to get<br />back into it. That's all.
1693281 1694581 It must be difficult.
1694681 1697901 I do volunteer work with<br />some disadvantaged women
1698002 1700541 and a few of them have<br />lost their husbands
1700641 1703413 and they find it very hard.
1705001 1706502 How's Richard's merger going?
1706601 1710581 Oh, good. I mean,<br />his workload's just ballooned.
1710681 1713261 I've got the kids 24/7,<br />it feels like.
1713362 1714381 Tell me about it!
1714481 1716621 I don't even have time to go to<br />the gym anymore. It's ridiculous!
1716721 1718181 That's a real tragedy.
1718282 1721381 Not having time to go to the<br />gym anymore. How do you cope?
1721481 1723381 You must have so much to talk about
1723481 1725285 with those poor disadvantaged women.
1736041 1739501 This is my tree house.<br />You're not allowed in here.
1739601 1741212 I'm not hurting anybody.
1743441 1745405 Bye.
1747081 1749249 - Thanks.<br />- Thanks.
1754761 1756541 How would your mum<br />know if it's real or not?
1756641 1758501 She never comes to our house.
1758601 1760901 Mum told Dad she didn't<br />want to go to your house
1761001 1762701 'cause it's too depressing.
1762801 1765581 The Babadook would eat<br />your mum for breakfast.
1765681 1768021 - It'd rip her arms off.<br />- Shut up!
1768121 1771102 They feel sorry for me, Claire.<br />There's a big difference.
1771201 1773422 God, Amelia, as soon as anyone<br />mentions Oskar, you can't cope.
1773521 1775902 - That's not true.<br />- It'll be seven years.
1776001 1777301 Isn't it time you moved on?
1777402 1778782 I have moved on.
1778881 1782101 I don't mention him.<br />I don't talk about him.
1782202 1784142 What strain is that on you, Claire?
1784241 1786821 You're not even good<br />enough to have a dad.
1786921 1788781 Everyone else has one and you don't.
1788881 1790381 I do have a dad!
1790481 1793141 I listen to your life<br />day in, day out,
1793241 1796101 and you never stop to ask<br />me anything about mine.
1796202 1798654 I do! I want to know how you are.
1798754 1800582 You don't come round<br />to our house anymore.
1800681 1802701 Because I can't stand<br />being around your son.
1802801 1805221 I can't believe you just said that.
1805321 1807661 You can't stand being<br />around him yourself.
1807761 1810062 Your dad died so he didn't<br />have to be with you.
1810161 1812662 - That's not true!<br />- And your mum doesn't want you.
1813433 1814818 No-one wants you.
1825641 1826701 What did you do?!
1826801 1829572 She said I didn't have a dad.<br />She kept saying it.
1830921 1832381 Is she alright?
1832481 1836901 Stay here and look after the children<br />or do you want another one to get hurt?
1837768 1841781 Mummy! She wouldn't believe me!
1841882 1844181 Mummy! Mummy!
1844281 1846021 Mummy!
1846122 1849861 - Mummy! Mummy!<br />- Why can't you just be normal?!
1851482 1853581 There is no Babadook!
1855361 1857723 Get out!
1860081 1862541 - Get out!<br />- Samuel?
1862641 1864701 - Mummy!<br />- Stop this now!
1864801 1867461 Get out! Get out! Get out!
1885961 1887061 Please help me!
1887161 1889443 There's something wrong with my son.
1900641 1903621 I think it may have been<br />a febrile convulsion.
1903721 1905421 That's when the brain overheats.
1905522 1908501 - It always looks worse than it is.<br />- I've never seen anything like this.
1908601 1910501 We'll have to wait until<br />the tests come back.
1910602 1912221 All his other results are normal.
1912321 1916222 He's obviously suffering<br />a high level of anxiety.
1916321 1917901 Very committed to the monster theory.
1918002 1919532 That's an understatement.
1920401 1922821 All children see monsters.
1922921 1924805 Not like this.
1925881 1927781 And it's getting worse.
1927882 1930381 He's becoming aggressive.
1930482 1931901 He could see a psychiatrist.
1932002 1933461 I can refer you.
1933561 1934981 Takes a few weeks to get in.
1935081 1936442 That'd be great.
1938081 1941182 But can you just give<br />me something for now,
1941281 1943848 just to make him sleep?
1944721 1946491 Just until...
1947521 1949803 just until we get an appointment.
1950761 1952741 Please?
1952842 1957341 I haven't slept in weeks<br />and neither has Samuel
1957441 1960621 and when we go home tonight, this<br />whole nightmare will start up again
1960721 1961821 and I am really...
1961921 1964886 I'm really not coping.
1966842 1971181 I can give you a short<br />course of sedatives.
1971281 1973501 Just until the tests come back.
1973601 1978181 Most mothers aren't too keen<br />on them unless it's really bad.
1978281 1980404 It's really bad.
1987122 1991421 These can make children feel foggy.
1991522 1993582 Perhaps some temporary nausea.
1993681 1996661 They'll certainly help<br />him sleep, though.
1996761 2000408 - That's for one week.<br />- Thank you.
2002241 2004422 Why don't people like me?
2004521 2006421 Why do you say that?
2006521 2010488 Ruby said people don't<br />like me 'cause I'm weird.
2011481 2015481 Sometimes people say<br />things that aren't true.
2018721 2024172 You just need to take your medicine,<br />have a big sleep and not worry.
2025402 2027021 I don't want you to die.
2027121 2030021 I'm not gonna die<br />for a long time yet.
2030121 2034406 Did you think that about<br />my dad before he died?
2038162 2041541 Just take your pill so<br />you can go to sleep.
2041641 2043782 I've got the day off tomorrow.
2043881 2045741 Maybe we could do something?
2045842 2048982 Will these make the Babadook go away?
2049081 2052422 I think so but you have to promise<br />me not to mention it again.
2052521 2056301 I promise to protect you if<br />you promise to protect me.
2056402 2058061 Then I won't mention it.
2058161 2062221 I promise to protect you.
2062321 2064171 Come on.
2074761 2076087 Come on.
2082121 2084421 Can you stay here with me?
2084522 2086261 Yes.
2086361 2088502 I love you, Mum.
2088601 2090530 Me too.
2265241 2267381 Her nose is broken in two places.
2267482 2269501 - She may need surgery.<br />- I'll pay for everything.
2269601 2271181 You can't even pay your own bills.
2271281 2272501 Look, I really have to go.
2272601 2276142 Claire, I think someone is<br />stalking me and Samuel.
2276241 2277461 What?
2277561 2279422 A book turned up at our place.
2279521 2282901 I threw it away but somebody<br />glued it back together
2283002 2284621 and put it on our doorstep.
2284721 2287901 Amelia, I just can't<br />help you right now.
2288001 2290741 I don't expect you to help.<br />I just wanted...
2290841 2292901 If you're that worried,<br />you should go to the police.
2293002 2294938 I have to go.
2313681 2315531 Claire!
2317121 2318652 Hello?
2320041 2324261 Babadook...
2324361 2328486 dook... dook.
2334441 2337141 Hi.
2337241 2340941 I want to report someone<br />stalking me and my child.
2341041 2342221 Can you tell us what happened?
2342321 2345061 Somebody sent me a children's book.
2346801 2348981 And?
2349081 2352021 And it contained violent<br />and graphic images
2352122 2353981 of my child and me being murdered.
2354081 2355901 Can we have a look<br />at the book, please?
2356001 2358061 I burnt it.
2358162 2360661 You burnt it?
2360762 2361741 Yes.
2361841 2364442 Well, unfortunately,<br />there's nothing we can do about it.
2366001 2369581 He's been making phone<br />calls to me as well.
2369682 2370821 What's he been saying?
2370922 2374342 Nothing, just making these... noises.
2374441 2376101 How do you know it's the same person?
2376201 2378462 Because of what he wrote in the book.
2378561 2380141 The book you burnt?
2380242 2382523 Yes.
2398001 2399282 OK.
2400601 2402724 Don't worry about it.
2411801 2413741 Did you get your things done?
2413842 2415821 Mrs Roach has Parkinson's.
2415921 2417542 That's why she shakes like this.
2417641 2420422 Samuel, you don't have to say<br />everything that goes through your head.
2420521 2422902 Oh, it's alright, love.
2423001 2427702 He wanted to know so<br />we talked about it.
2427801 2430261 He sees things as they are, that one.
2430361 2431901 Oskar was the same.
2432001 2433541 He always spoke his mind.
2433641 2436606 Do you have to keep<br />on bringing him up?
2442161 2443501 Hey, Bugsy.
2445328 2446421 Hey.
2447288 2448337 Hey!
2511922 2514283 Don't come in here.
2526001 2528221 I don't want to buy anything.
2528321 2530221 Are you Amelia Vanick?
2530321 2531221 Yes.
2531321 2533701 I'm Warren Newton and<br />this is Prue Flannery
2533801 2535421 from the Department<br />of Community Services.
2535521 2537381 My son's only been away for two days.
2537481 2540781 He's not actually registered<br />at Babbage Bay anymore.
2540881 2542901 If I could just come<br />in and meet Samuel
2543001 2545125 and get you to look at<br />these papers, that'd be great.
2546041 2550821 I'm just in the middle of cleaning<br />up the house at the moment.
2550921 2554921 I'm sorry. There's stuff everywhere.
2557241 2559421 Hello, Samuel.
2559522 2563567 I'm Prue and this is Warren.
2564801 2566181 How are you?
2566281 2569741 I'm a bit tired from<br />the drugs Mum gave me.
2569841 2573661 Not drugs. Tranquillisers...<br />from the doctor.
2573761 2575461 He had a fit yesterday.
2575562 2578741 I'm really tired, actually.
2578842 2580692 That's no good.
2583242 2585221 May I have a glass of water, please?
2585321 2589685 Yes. Of course. I'll get you one.
2596081 2597901 It's a real mess.
2598001 2600221 I just found this<br />cockroach infestation.
2600321 2601701 I normally have the house sprayed.
2601801 2603501 I did actually already<br />have it sprayed
2603601 2606221 but there's this hole in<br />the wall behind the fridge
2606321 2608125 and that's why I...
2612561 2615021 I didn't mean a hole in the wall.
2615121 2617421 There was a hole in the wallpaper.
2617522 2619621 That's where they were<br />laying their eggs, I think.
2619722 2622003 We've caught you at a bad time.
2623041 2624581 I'll leave you with this.
2624681 2628821 We're required to come back in a<br />week to talk through your options.
2628922 2631249 Here's my card.
2632241 2636969 Mum, I think I'm gonna vomit.
2655481 2660581 - What was that noise I heard?<br />- I didn't hear any noise.
2660681 2662781 Wind howling, doors slamming.
2662881 2665853 I declare, I think this house is haunted.
2666241 2669741 Mum, I'm gonna go to bed.
2669841 2671661 Are you sick?
2671761 2673201 Oh, no, Granny.
2674561 2676461 It's only 6:00.
2676561 2679101 Don't you want to stay up<br />with your mum for a while?
2679201 2680501 No.
2680601 2683725 If you go to bed now,<br />the pills won't work properly.
2686841 2690602 You have to stay up<br />for a while, sweetheart.
2704681 2708101 Where's its mother, Skip?<br />Koalas don't leave their babies about.
2708489 2711413 - Are you off now, Dad?<br />- Yep. Soon as I fuel up.
2711513 2713581 Tell Jerry I'll keep<br />in touch on the radio
2713682 2715963 and I'll be back before breakfast<br />the day after tomorrow.
2717281 2719381 "And the Prince and the Princess
2719481 2722221 "lived happily together<br />in a beautiful palace
2722322 2724922 "for the rest of their days."
2823241 2826741 Babadook...
2826842 2830542 dook... dook.
2863602 2865981 What are we doing?
2866081 2867741 We're going downstairs.
2867842 2870328 - Why?<br />- Because we are.
2888162 2890902 Iris, Iris, Iris.
2891001 2892661 No.
2940321 2941981 Glass and mirror attachment.
2942081 2945381 Clean and polish shower doors or<br />mirrors for a streak-free shine.
2945482 2948461 As part of your steaming special, we'll<br />even include the garment and upholst...
2948561 2952130 Oh, I don't want to give<br />it to anyone at work.
2953601 2958008 Alright. Give all my shifts away.<br />That's just what I need.
2959641 2960861 I can't help it if I'm sick.
2960961 2962527 What do you expect me to do?
2963481 2965206 You do that!
2978881 2983643 Mum, I took the pills<br />but I feel sick again.
2985081 2987933 I need to eat something.
2991681 2995442 I couldn't find any<br />food in the fridge.
2996961 3000021 You said to have them with food.
3000121 3003821 I'm really hungry, Mum.
3003922 3007781 Why do you have to<br />keep talk, talk, talking?
3007881 3009661 Don't you ever stop?
3009761 3013141 - I was just...<br />- I need to sleep!
3013242 3016501 I'm sorry, Mummy.<br />I was just really hungry.
3016601 3020886 If you're that hungry,<br />why don't you go and eat shit?
3052841 3054341 I'm so sorry.
3054441 3057690 I don't know why I said that.<br />It was terrible.
3058681 3062061 I've had absolutely no sleep.
3062161 3064648 I didn't know what I was saying.
3066161 3068250 I'll cook you something. Hey?
3069321 3070501 What would you like?
3070601 3072691 I'm not hungry anymore.
3079241 3080981 We really need to get<br />out of this house.
3081081 3083649 We've been cooped up here<br />too long. That's the problem.
3088081 3090090 Do you want to go to Wally's?
3090961 3093301 You can have anything<br />you want. Alright?
3093401 3097162 Even ice-cream for<br />breakfast if you like.
3099242 3102181 Give it back! Give it back!
3102281 3106102 - Stop it! Sit down. Sit down.<br />- No!
3106201 3107981 - Now!<br />- Give my drink back!
3108081 3109646 Sit down, please.
3115401 3116501 Where are we going?
3116601 3119771 I just want to drive<br />for a little while.
3133041 3134861 Mummy! Mummy!
3137242 3139261 Babadook.
3149530 3151102 You ran straight into me!
3151201 3155611 I just bought this bloody car.<br />What were you thinking?
3156162 3159021 Oh, driving on the wrong side<br />of the road with a kid in the back.
3159121 3160901 You could've killed someone!
3162439 3166442 Hey! Hey, what are you doing?<br />Hey! Crazy bitch!
3173001 3175523 Hi, sweetheart.
3183081 3184851 Mum?
3186041 3188608 I can call Aunty Claire.
3191201 3194326 I can call and she can come over.
3197401 3198701 Mum?
3198801 3203404 Aunty Claire doesn't want<br />to talk to us anymore.
3204681 3207964 Mum. Mum, look at me.
3232881 3235653 It's nice and warm in here.
3238841 3241169 I don't want you to go away.
3243041 3245370 I'm not going anywhere.
3257041 3258606 Mum?
3265721 3270006 Mum, I don't think we<br />should stay here tonight.
3271081 3273061 I can call Mrs Roach.
3273162 3277048 I don't want you to call anyone.
3279641 3282287 I just need to sleep.
3286081 3288329 - Mum...<br />- Leave it!
3318201 3320369 There's something in the house.
3334202 3335941 There's someone in the house!
3389121 3392963 Mrs Roach can we come<br />and stay the night?
3401801 3403621 Gracie, I'm so sorry.
3403721 3405942 Has someone broken into the house?
3406041 3408901 - Sam said that...<br />- No, no, no. We're fine.
3409001 3410742 Samuel's just being<br />very disobedient again.
3410841 3412942 Oh, I was so worried.
3413041 3414421 I told him not to call anyone.
3414521 3416261 He asked if you could stay the night.
3416362 3418982 No, no, no. We're fine. I just<br />have a headache. That's all.
3419081 3421204 I really have to go,<br />though, now, Gracie.
3422481 3423902 I'm so sorry for troubling you.
3424001 3425422 Yes. Talk soon.
3425521 3427211 No worries. Talk soon.
3429481 3434010 I told you not to call anyone and<br />you deliberately disobeyed me.
3434921 3436942 Do you want to frighten Mrs Roach?
3437041 3439061 An old lady who can hardly walk?
3439161 3440852 Do you want to make her sick?
3442441 3444723 Get that bloody thing off!
3448481 3453301 Is this the only way I can<br />trust you not to embarrass me
3453402 3455046 in front of our neighbours?
3459361 3461086 Is this what I have to do?
3472042 3473061 I'm sorry, Mummy.
3473161 3475221 It's just that the Babadook made<br />you crash the car and then...
3475321 3477141 What'd you say?
3477241 3478741 I said the Babadook...
3478841 3480301 The Babadook isn't real, Samuel.
3480401 3483982 He's just something you've made<br />up in your stupid little head.
3484081 3486421 I just didn't want you to let it in!
3486521 3489981 I'll make sure nothing<br />gets in tonight.
3490081 3491501 Alright, Samuel?
3491601 3493941 Nothing is coming in here tonight.
3494041 3495731 Nothing!
3531201 3533461 I feel sick.
3533561 3537661 If you don't take the pill,<br />you'll feel worse.
3537762 3539221 Mum, I don't think I need...
3539321 3542446 I am the parent and you are<br />the child so take the pill.
3564761 3567089 Good boy.
3588642 3590127 Mum!
3606401 3610003 Hey, Bugsy. Hey, sweetie.
3611881 3614368 Come here, sweetie. Hey?
3615361 3616801 Hey.
3617722 3619411 Hey!
3639281 3641131 Here we go.
3646561 3648843 There's more where that came from.
3666481 3667472 What's the secret?
3670161 3673181 - ...letter of Max's, didn't you?<br />- No, not for a minute.
3673281 3674981 Don't lie. You called<br />me a jezebel. Why?
3675081 3677102 - The north, east.<br />- Natural corset.
3677201 3678812 With fresh meat.
3680841 3682111 Only five...
3683066 3685683 You don't wanna go in there<br />all by yourself, do you?
3687282 3691502 Police say the woman used a<br />kitchen knife to stab her son.
3691601 3693581 His body was found in their basement.
3693681 3696221 The woman later attacked<br />officers with a knife.
3696322 3700302 They drew their guns<br />and shot her to death.
3700401 3702181 Little is known about the tragedy
3702281 3705981 but neighbours say the boy was<br />celebrating his birthday today.
3706081 3708301 He had just turned seven.
3722201 3723927 Samuel?
3727841 3729531 Wake up, Mummy.
3732161 3735490 But you're the one<br />who's asleep, sweetheart.
3740601 3742485 Don't go down there.
3746801 3748652 It's not safe.
3783801 3787050 I thought you were dead.
3787921 3790567 I thought you were dead.
3804241 3806409 We're gonna be together.
3808721 3811208 You just need to bring me the boy.
3832481 3834781 You mean Samuel?
3834881 3837288 You can bring me the boy.
3839642 3841366 You can bring me the boy.
3843161 3844582 You can bring me the boy.
3844681 3845941 Stop calling him 'the boy'.
3846041 3848061 I think it's going to rain.
3848162 3849421 No.
3937681 3940885 It isn't real. It isn't real.<br />It isn't real.
3952361 3954381 Oh, no.
3959761 3961725 No! No!
3969241 3970581 Bugsy!
4077881 4079461 Samuel!
4084721 4086411 Samuel.
4087922 4092171 Bugsy's hurt and we need to get help.
4094441 4097009 You don't want him to die, do you?
4100641 4102261 Samuel.
4102361 4105486 Are you listening to me?
4109042 4111301 Let me in, you little shit!
4111401 4113661 Let me in!
4113761 4114901 Let me in!
4115001 4116381 Let me in!
4116481 4118357 Let me in!
4140722 4142782 You little pig!
4142881 4146461 Six years old and you're<br />still wetting yourself.
4146561 4148542 You don't know how many times
4148641 4152301 I wished it was you,<br />not him, that died.
4152401 4153981 I just want you to be happy.
4154081 4157285 "I just want you to be happy."
4160281 4161661 Sometimes...
4161761 4165341 I just wanna smash your<br />head against a brick wall
4165441 4168461 until your fucking brains pop out.
4168562 4170461 You're not my mother.
4170561 4174501 - What did you say?<br />- I said you're not my mother!
4174602 4177902 I am your mother!
4179802 4183301 Run, run, run, as fast as you can!
4186641 4187861 Get away!
4187961 4189701 Didn't I tell you not<br />to play with weapons?
4236801 4239581 I'm sorry, love. I know it's late.
4239681 4241662 I just wanted to make<br />sure you were OK.
4241761 4244542 I'm OK.
4244641 4250221 I know... this time of year's<br />terribly hard for you.
4250322 4254341 And I know you don't want me<br />to go on about it, so I won't.
4254441 4259341 But I just wanted you to know that<br />I'd do anything for you and Sam.
4259441 4261610 I love you both.
4264561 4266445 Samuel.
4269001 4270805 I'm sorry.
4273401 4275142 I understand you're scared.
4275241 4278982 I haven't been good<br />since your dad died.
4279081 4282251 I haven't been good at all.
4284721 4288289 I'm sick, Sam. I need help.
4292161 4295012 I just spoke with Mrs Roach.
4297561 4299861 We're going to stay there tonight.
4299962 4302971 Do you want that?
4307041 4310211 I want to make it up to you, Sam.
4320682 4322849 I want you to meet your dad.
4324361 4327007 It's beautiful there.
4328362 4331041 You'll be happy.
4337201 4339005 Sorry, Mummy!
4385282 4387221 Mum!
4387321 4389302 Mum!
4389498 4391729 I'm not leaving you.
4394801 4397811 Mum? Mum?
4404241 4407285 You said we'd protect each other.
4412641 4415082 I know you don't love me.
4416241 4418301 The Babadook won't let you.
4418401 4420842 But I love you, Mum.
4422001 4424488 And I always will.
4433401 4437606 You let it in.<br />You have to get it out!
4441321 4443941 I don't want you to go away.
4444041 4445461 No! No! No!
4445561 4447844 Mummy!
4495681 4497021 Mummy!
4497121 4499021 Mummy!
4499122 4500902 Mummy!
4501001 4503261 Mummy! Mummy!
4503361 4505341 Mummy!
4505442 4506861 Mummy!
4543282 4544541 What is it?
4544641 4546606 You can't get rid of the Babadook.
4575681 4577043 What do you want?
4580281 4582165 What do you want?
4618281 4619861 No.
4619962 4623052 Keep breathing.
4625961 4629211 Put your seat back, sweetheart.<br />10 more minutes and we're there.
4633201 4635369 No.
4639761 4641021 I think it's gonna rain.
4641121 4642941 Stop!
4689281 4691341 You are nothing.
4703281 4704501 You're nothing!
4713642 4715982 This is my house!
4719962 4723181 You are trespassing in my house!
4732521 4737061 If you touch my son again<br />I'll fucking kill you!
4745561 4747843 No!
4789642 4791003 Mummy, don't!
4796721 4798621 Don't!
4900481 4902861 Watch out for your<br />mum's leg, little one.
4902961 4904781 He's fine. I've had the stitches out.
4904881 4906541 What time's the party?
4906642 4907821 Any time after three is fine.
4907921 4909662 I'll see you in a few hours, then.
4909761 4911181 Bye.
4911281 4912901 Bye, Sam.
4913001 4915181 That school's a good choice.
4915282 4918901 I've been doing a lot of reading about<br />it so I think Sam will be happy there.
4919001 4922501 He's been out of school over two<br />weeks now. It's time to get back.
4922601 4925781 We needed some time to<br />sort a few things out.
4927161 4928821 Are you having a party?
4928921 4930502 It's Sam's birthday today.
4930601 4933701 My first birthday<br />I've ever celebrated.
4933802 4935141 That's not true.
4935241 4937661 Yes, it is. My first<br />party on the day.
4937762 4939496 That's unusual.
4942281 4945462 My husband died the<br />day that Sam was born.
4945561 4948890 He got killed driving Mum<br />to the hospital to have me.
4950721 4952621 Sam's just like his dad was.
4952722 4954661 Always speaks his mind.
4954761 4958821 Well, parties are lots of fun,<br />especially when they're yours.
4958921 4963422 My cousin's not coming because<br />I broke her nose in two places.
4965801 4967924 I'll take that for you.
4986441 4987661 Good shot.
4987761 4989861 Look, there's another one!
4989961 4992163 Where's your bowl?
4994801 4998084 Wow. You've got a lot today.
4999401 5001301 Am I ever gonna see it?
5001401 5004890 One day, when you're bigger.
5010161 5014332 You go outside, and you<br />don't come in until I tell you.
5056921 5060581 It's alright. It's alright.
5060681 5062541 It's alright.
5095681 5097221 How was it?
5097321 5099922 It was pretty quiet today.
5101682 5103406 Come here.
5107201 5109722 It's getting much better, Mum.
5113241 5114461 Wait!
5114562 5116809 I have a new trick.
5119922 5122701 Life is not always as it seems.
5122802 5125846 Nothing in my hands.<br />Nothing in my hands.
5130601 5133566 - That's great!<br />- I haven't finished.
5142481 5145764 Abracadabra!
5147961 5149581 How did you do that?
5154762 5157842 Come here, you. Come here.
5167681 5170361 Happy birthday, sweetheart.
