63000 65080 Thousands took to the streets<br />and thousands kill...
65080 70080 Many peaceful protesting monks have been<br />killed, some burnt alive and others drowned..
70080 72200 Foreign journalists have<br />been shot and caned..
72200 75880 Thousands of villages have been destroyed.<br />Rape and torture are a daily occurrence.
75880 78480 In Burma there are more landmines,<br />than anywhere in the world.
78480 82000 Young men are bitten and forced into<br />the army. Many as young as 12 years old.
82000 84000 Beheadings and mutilations<br />are common.
84000 88680 The Karen people comprising mostly of poor Christian<br />farmers have been singled out for extermination.
88680 92880 The military government wants many of<br />the abundance resources on the Karen land.
92880 98080 The bloody military campaign against the Karen<br />people has been going on for almost 60 years.
98480 102600 The longest radical civil<br />war in the world.
170400 173600 Ready. Send them out!
196600 200080 Move!
204800 207400 Shoot them all!
432800 437000 Fuck off, OK?
467600 470680 Looks like dangerous work.
471200 473400 I am Michael Burnett.
473400 475200 Do you have some time to talk?
475200 476800 Won't take too long, I promise.
476800 479480 I was told it might be possible to<br />rent your boat. We like to do that.
479480 481600 Is that possible?
481600 482600 We need to get up river.
482600 484200 Where are you going?
484200 485800 Into Burma.
485800 487400 Burma is a war zone.
487400 489080 That's what people call it.
489080 492000 But it's more like<br />genocide than war.
492400 495080 Anyway, this will be<br />my fifth trip in,
495080 499000 so we are aware of all the risks.
499880 502480 I don't go that far north.
502480 505480 Let me explain our situation.
505480 507480 Our church is part of<br />the Pan-Asia ministry..
507480 509000 located in Colorado.
509000 511480 We are all volunteers, whom<br />around this time of the year,
511480 514680 bring in medical supplies,<br />medical attention..
514680 518400 prayer books and support for<br />the Karen tribe's people.
518400 521200 People say you know the river<br />better than anyone.
521200 522480 They lied.
522480 525000 So what I am asking is that<br />we compensate you...
525000 527200 for a few hours of your time..
527200 530000 that will help change people's lives.
531880 534000 Are you bringing in any weapons?
534000 535280 Of course not.
535280 537800 You are not changing anything.
540800 544800 It's thinking like that,<br />that keeps the world the way it is.
544800 547080 Fuck the world.
548880 550000 - Let's go<br />- Why?
550000 551400 He's not interested.
551400 553400 - Let me try.<br />- Sara...
553400 555000 It'll be an interesting<br />trip going up there.
555000 556200 What do we have to lose?.
556200 558600 Let me try.
558600 560480 Sarah.
568480 570200 Hello?
570200 575200 I am Sarah Miller. Hope you don't<br />mind me coming back here.
575200 577680 The man you were talking to...
577680 580200 I wasn't talking to anybody.
580200 584000 Ok, the man that was talking to you..
584000 587480 asked if we could hire your boat<br />to go up river.
587480 589400 and you said no, why?
589400 591680 Can't help you out.
591680 597200 If you have some reasons,<br />mind if I heard them?
598200 602880 Go home.
750400 753480 Why did you come back?
754080 756800 Waiting for you.
759400 761800 I told you before,<br />I can't help you.
761800 764000 We need to know why you<br />can't help these people.
764000 765200 We are here to make a difference.
765200 767480 We believe all lives are special.
767480 768680 Some lives, some no.
768680 769800 Really?
769800 772200 If everyone thought like you,<br />nothing will ever change.
772200 772800 Nothing will change.
772800 774680 Of course it does.<br />Nothing stays the same.
774680 776280 Value your life, it's a good one
776280 778000 It's what I am trying to do!
778000 780280 No, what you are trying to do<br />is change what is.
780280 782680 And what is?
782680 785880 Go home.
786880 791800 Really.<br />Go home.
814880 817080 Maybe...
817080 820000 Maybe you lost your faith in people.
820000 826000 But you feel the same for something.<br />You must still care for something.
826400 829480 Maybe we can't change what it is,
830000 836000 But trying to save a life,<br />isn't wasting your life. Is it?
858480 861400 As bad as these people are,<br />they will eventually lose.
861400 864080 They can't keep it up against<br />a united front.
864080 865400 They can't!
865400 869800 Time alone will tell. In the meantime,<br />we just got to hold it together.
869800 871680 Just the other day...
871680 873480 Excuse me, Sara?
873480 875200 Where are you going?
875200 877280 To talk to him.
877280 879000 He'll probably want his privacy.
879000 880280 Michael, you shouldn't worry,<br />he's helping us.
880280 881680 He's being paid.
881680 884400 He didn't take anything.
891480 893280 Thank you again for doing this.
893280 896000 Really from all of us.
896280 899080 You never told us your name.
899080 901600 John.
901600 903800 Where are you from?
903800 906000 Arizona.
906000 908680 - Why did you leave?<br />- I got drafted in Vietnam.
908680 911080 And you just stayed?
911080 913200 It's complicated.
913200 915200 You have a family back home?
915200 918280 Father maybe.<br />I don't know.
919280 924080 Aren't you curious to see what<br />might have changed back home?
924400 927400 Don't have a reason for that.
931800 934000 Sara.
934000 936480 Because of you we going,<br />I'll approve it..
936480 938600 anytime you want to turn around...
938600 941200 ...it is done.
941200 943880 Ok.
993000 994880 What is it?<br />Who are they?
994880 996800 Burmese pirates.
996800 999480 Everyone sit down,<br />don't make a sound.
999480 1004200 - It's all right.<br />- Don't talk.
1040080 1042400 - Are there more of them?<br />- Maybe.
1042400 1044000 We will know?
1044000 1046200 We should keep going.<br />We made a commitment.
1046200 1047800 I ain't talking to you.
1047800 1052280 What do you want to do? - We are a<br />group here. They want to vote. Vote.
1052600 1053600 Sit down!
1053600 1056080 If it is money they want...
1057880 1061280 Nobody talks. Heads down!
1185080 1187480 What are you doing?
1187480 1190280 We come here to stop the killing.<br />Who are you to kill?
1190280 1192200 - Who are you?<br />- Let him go!
1192200 1196680 You want them to rape her<br />fifty times and cut her head off!
1196680 1197680 Who are you?
1197680 1200600 Who are any of you?
1200600 1204000 We are going back.
1208800 1213000 No. We shouldn't go back!
1213200 1214800 Let go.
1214800 1217480 - What are you doing?<br />- We are so close!
1217480 1219400 What has happened here is horrible...
1219400 1223480 But what the people in there are<br />being killed like this every day.
1223480 1228800 Michael this was your idea.<br />We made a commitment.
1228800 1231600 I know you don't believe<br />in what we are doing,
1231600 1233080 But it is our lives.
1233080 1235600 Our choice.
1236400 1239800 You are not going<br />to change anything.
1240280 1242000 Please
1242000 1244080 Please John.
1244080 1246600 Please
1257680 1261200 Go sit down.
1315480 1320600 We are taking the overland route on the way<br />back, so there is no need to wait around.
1320680 1322880 I have to report this.
1322880 1325400 I know you think what you did is right,..
1325400 1328480 but taking a life is never right.
1342800 1345200 I don't know what to say.
1345200 1350280 Maybe you shouldn't say anything.<br />Should you? Good Luck.
1522600 1525200 Open your mouth.
1558680 1562880 We signify your faith with<br />this little flower, ok?
1576200 1579600 Hey dear. Can you hand<br />over the bandages?
1601400 1605480 Get out of here!<br />What about them?  Go on, take them!
1809000 1811480 ......calling Raven.
1811480 1814200 Over...
1814280 1815400 What am I?
1815400 1818800 We made you this way.<br />You are a full blooded combat soldier.
1818800 1820480 Talk to me Johnny!
1820480 1821480 You don't just turn it off!
1821480 1827080 - It's over!<br />- Nothing is over!
1830680 1835000 Aren't you curious how things<br />might have changed back home?
1835000 1837000 You have done enough damage!
1837000 1840480 You will always<br />be tearing away soldier..
1840480 1842480 till you come to terms<br />with what you are.
1842480 1846200 So you are just going<br />to stay here forever?
1847800 1849880 John Rambo!
1849880 1851600 John.
1851600 1854280 John Rambo.
1865800 1868400 My name is Arthur Marsh.
1868400 1871680 Pastor of Christ Church Colorado.
1871680 1873600 I need to talk with you.
1873600 1878480 It is very important, otherwise<br />I won't come here like this.
1880880 1883080 The morning of the day<br />the group left,..
1883080 1885200 Michael Burnet notified me...
1885200 1889200 that they were traveling<br />through this location.
1890800 1892000 What happened?
1892000 1893600 No one knows exactly.
1893600 1896800 They will supposed to return 10 days ago,<br />but they never came back.
1896800 1899800 I requested help from the embassy,<br />but they can't help.
1899800 1902600 Not in Burma and not in time.
1904080 1905800 How do you know they are alive?.
1905800 1909480 Because we have been in contact<br />with the Karen freedom fighters,
1909480 1912800 who say they think they know<br />where they were taken.
1912800 1916880 I was given the name of an ex-military<br />American local from the embassy..
1916880 1920280 who put me in touch with men who say they<br />have experience in this part of the world.
1920280 1922200 Mercenaries?
1922400 1925000 Yes.
1925000 1926480 I don't have any other choice.
1926480 1930400 You know the exact spot.<br />We need you to take these men,
1930400 1933480 to where you let our people off.
1933480 1936000 When are they ready to leave?
1936000 1938200 When you are.
1954680 1957800 You know what you are.
1957800 1961200 What you are made off.
1962200 1964880 War is in your blood.
1965400 1968000 Don't fight it.
1968680 1971680 Did you kill for your country?
1971680 1975800 Did you kill for yourself?
1978480 1982600 God is never going<br />to make that go away.
1986400 1989400 When you are pushed...
1992480 1995800 Killing is as easy as breathing.
2021600 2023600 Look at this fucking place!
2023600 2025680 Only a fucking ape would live here!
2025680 2027680 What a fuck am I doing here?
2027680 2030400 Hey, knock that shit off!
2030400 2032000 And you don't like the arts?
2032000 2034400 And you don't like the shit.<br />I like your sister, Diaz.
2034400 2035880 She got a thing for retards.
2035880 2038480 Hey boatman!
2038480 2041880 How much longer in this<br />ancient piece of shit?
2044200 2047200 What did the reverent say?
2047200 2049280 Something about his flock went missing.
2049280 2053880 I said look mate, that is what you get<br />when you're trespassing into fucking Burma.
2053880 2057200 That's what you get, when you go around<br />sniffing other people's garbage.
2057200 2061000 You know those generals in there are making millions,<br />cranking up more than anyone in this planet.
2061000 2062080 Bullshit!
2062080 2064800 Millions, Moron. How do you<br />think they paid for that shit all ?
2064800 2067400 Try to read the papers<br />instead of sticking under it.
2067400 2070000 The general is the biggest junkies<br />of all of them.
2070000 2071480 It's noble Louis..
2071480 2075400 You are? Those people going in<br />without weapons.
2075400 2077600 Just books and medicine.
2077600 2079000 It's noble.
2079000 2080200 Ok, schoolboy!
2080200 2082200 You stick your nose in other people's<br />business, you get fucked up...
2082200 2084600 or you are dead.
2084600 2087200 The only reason I am doing this<br />is for an ex-wife and 3 kids.
2087200 2089800 and after the shit is over, you can<br />shove that right up your ass.
2089800 2091680 - Try to think careful, mate!<br />- Back off!
2091680 2095280 And you, I don't want to die of old age<br />before I get there. So move.
2101680 2105480 You said something?
2220280 2227400 Is it me? Or is it the air coming in<br />smelling like some wet dog?
2227800 2231000 For fuck sake, I can swim<br />faster than this.
2231000 2234800 - Am I right?<br />- We dead.
2234800 2240080 Chop, chop. The quicker we are there,<br />the quicker we get back.
2243080 2246600 Those idiots.
2246600 2248800 They come here..
2248800 2251680 start all the trouble...
2252080 2256400 ... expecting the whole world to work<br />like their old neighbours. Well it doesn't..
2256600 2259800 So they send in the devil...
2259800 2263480 ... to do god's work.<br />Ironic isn't it?
2264480 2267600 Am I boring you man?
2267680 2271200 Is it the trip? It's got you nervous?
2271200 2272880 Because we..
2272880 2275480 ...we really appreciate the action.<br />You know what I mean?
2275480 2279000 Look at me in the eyes if<br />you know what I am saying.
2281000 2283400 Oh dear..
2283400 2287280 You are really an uptight master,<br />aren't you?
2287880 2290000 You can drop the act in your stare.
2290000 2292680 I have seen it all before.
2292680 2295600 I am not impressed.
2305800 2309080 He's old school, SAS.
2309080 2313280 The first rate soldier to be<br />told to go maniac.
2313280 2316080 They call him schoolboy.
2316080 2319600 The name stuck with him since.
2319600 2323600 The name he start calling me<br />no matter how many people I shoot.
2349480 2352880 What do you want from us?
2397480 2399880 One man and a kid in a chicken coop.
2399880 2401680 This sort of rebel they put up.
2401680 2405400 I am not liking it You are in a jungle,<br />there is nothing to like.
2405400 2406880 How are you doing?
2406880 2409480 My name is Bieth, this is Tha.
2409480 2410600 This is it?
2410600 2413280 What's with the kid?
2413280 2417400 He's a good tracker.<br />We don't need a tracker. We need a guide.
2417400 2418880 You know the exact location right?
2418880 2421000 10 km west.
2421000 2423680 To north 6 km walk.<br />- How many soldiers?
2423680 2426000 - 100 maybe.<br />- 100?
2426000 2428600 Heard what he said.<br />- More soldiers coming tomorrow.
2428600 2431480 I know I'm just a white trash<br />full of blanks, but I can count.
2431480 2433880 ...stop f..king with the 100 strong.<br />Alright, alright!
2433880 2435600 Let's get this straight.
2435600 2438400 We don't engage anybody.<br />If we can extract these people, good.
2438400 2440880 It's in, out, clean, or we go off.
2440880 2444280 Somebody want to tell me<br />what the boatman is doing?
2444600 2447800 Why don't you wait with the boat.
2448200 2451680 - My man will stay with the boat.<br />- Your boat, you stay here.
2451680 2452800 I won't slow you down.
2452800 2455200 No, you won't.<br />It's not a nature hunt?
2455200 2457680 You can believe that.<br />He can be with me at the back.
2457680 2460880 He stays here. He's the boatman.<br />He stays with the boat.
2460880 2462280 Only a white man with a f..king dick.
2462280 2465880 Who has the explosives?
2465880 2467880 I've got some C4.
2467880 2471080 - Ive got a claymore.<br />- Alright.
