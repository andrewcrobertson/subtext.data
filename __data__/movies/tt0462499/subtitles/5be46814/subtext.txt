133700 138057 Excuse me, can you tell me this<br />where Delmare Berry lives?
138780 140418 He ain't here.
141300 142733 Go on inside.
148420 153369 He's a friend of mine, he wrote<br />this address down, right here.
154220 155335 Here.
156100 161732 You can see that's Delmare's writing.<br />I sure had a hard time finding this place.
162180 165536 - That's his writin'.<br />- Like I said, he's a friend.
165980 169814 My name is John Rambo.<br />We served on the same team together in 'Nam.
170260 173172 I don't know if he ever talked about me.
173620 177135 I've got a picture of us together.
178220 179573 Somewhere.
180020 182295 This junk in my pocket!
182740 184332 Here... here it is.
184980 189451 That's me, that's Danforth,<br />Westmore, Bronson, Ortega,
189900 193097 and there's Delmare, right in the back.<br />Had to put him in the back because he's so big...
193540 197818 if we didn't, he'd take up the whole picture.<br />- Delmare's gone.
198940 201932 - What time will he be back?<br />- He died.
202420 203375 What?
204500 206252 Died last summer.
207660 209013 Died how?
209740 213255 Cancer. Brought it back from 'Nam.
214260 217457 All that orange stuff<br />they spread it around.
217900 221973 Cut him down to nothing.<br />I could lift him off the sheets.
231620 233212 I'm very sorry.
286820 290779 Morning Amy! How are you doing, girls?<br />- Great, thanks. - Alright this morning?
293700 295895 - Andy!<br />- Howdy, Will!
307380 312693 Good morning, Dave. - Hi, Sheriff.<br />- Gonna take a bath this week?
319220 320175 Morning!
324860 328057 You visiting someone around here?
329540 330655 No.
332380 336134 You know, wearing that flag on your jacket,<br />looking the way you do...
336940 339898 You're asking for trouble around here, friend.
340700 344136 - Headed north or south?<br />- North.
345300 349009 Jump in, I'll make sure you're<br />headed in the right direction.
360660 363015 - Where you heading?<br />- Portland.
363460 365576 Portland's is South, you said you were headed North.
367260 369171 You got some place I can eat around here?
371300 373689 There's a diner about 30 miles up the highway.
376340 380970 - Is there a law against me getting something to eat here?<br />- Yeah, me.
382180 383659 Why are you pushing me?
385300 386494 What did you say?
388060 389891 I said why are you pushing me,<br />I haven't done anything to you.
390340 393298 First of all, you don't ask the questions<br />around here, I do. Understand?
393740 398768 Secondly, we don't want guys like you in this town.
400460 401609 Drifters.
402060 407088 First thing you know we got a whole bunch<br />of guys like you in this town. That's why!
407700 412899 Besides, you wouldn't like it here,<br />This is a quiet little town.
414300 418851 In fact you might say it's boring.<br />But that's the way we like it.
420060 422130 And I get paid to keep it that way.
423540 424814 Boring.
440020 441976 Portland, straight ahead.
444060 445937 If you want some friendly advice...
446780 450489 Get your hair cut and take a bath.<br />You wouldn't get hassled so much.
450940 453215 Hope this ride helped you out.
458900 460811 Have a nice day, huh?
497540 499371 Where the hell do you think you're going?
500900 503130 I'm talking to you, goddammit!
507620 509497 Let's see some I.D.!
510380 511608 All right, you're under arrest!
512500 514138 Put your hands on the car.
514580 517048 You put your hands on the car,<br />and you spread them.
518860 521328 You're going to put your hands on that car,

536940 538498 Legs back.

543260 545728 You try to be nice to some people!
549580 551696 Well, what do we have here?
555380 558611 - Why would you be carrying a knife like this?<br />- Hunting.
559980 565612 Don't be a wise guy!<br />What do you hunt with a knife?<br />- Name it.
571060 572891 Hi, Will.<br />- Lester.
573340 577856 Buzz us in, will ya.<br />- Hey, talk about your sorry looking humanity.
578300 580814 Just another smartass drifter.
582980 586529 Morning, Arthur.<br />- Morning, Will. What do you got?
586980 592816 I want you to book this gentleman for vagrancy,<br />resisting arrest carrying a concealed weapon.
593260 597856 - He says he uses it for hunting.<br />- Huntin'? What do you hunt, elephants?
598300 601690 See if you can clean him up a little.<br />Smells like an animal.
607060 608015 Hey, Mitch.
610300 615169 - Escort this young man downstairs.<br />- Yes sir, Mr. Galt. Right this way, partner.
624100 626330 OK, here we go.
629860 635253 You know it looks like it'll take<br />old Leroy 10 years to paint this hall<br />- Why don't you paint it your damned self!!
635700 639090 Come on, Leroy, sling that paint, boy.<br />- Mr. Ward,
640380 642496 Take these.<br />- Thank you.
650500 651535 Name?

675060 676573 Wait.
677980 680130 You got three seconds before I break your face in.
680980 682413 He means it.
682860 684054 Yeah, I do.
702220 705849 What do you know about that.<br />Old Harry here is a soldier
706940 708055 Rambo.
709380 710495 John J.?
713220 715370 You're gonna talk to me.
716020 718136 I promise you're gonna talk to me, soldier.
720300 722291 I'm starting to dislike you.
723860 724815 A lot.
726980 728936 I'm gonna run a make on him.
730980 733130 Put his name in the Teletype.
734180 736455 Just roll it across.
736900 738219 Roll it across!
739740 744256 - Push it.<br />- It won't work that way<br />it'll only smear. Now, roll it across!
744700 748613 Look, you son of a bitch, if you don't put your<br />god damned hand down there, I'm gonna break it off!
749060 752894 Put it down, god dammit!<br />- What the hell's going on down here?
753340 755774 Nothing I can't handle.
756300 761090 He won't let us print him well.<br />Leave the ink on the hand!
762180 764330 Just what is your problem?
764940 769138 As things stand right now, you're facing<br />the ass end of a 90 day incarceration!
769580 774176 Plus a 250 dollar fine which you don't<br />look to me like you can pay.
774620 779455 At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning you're going up<br />in front of that judge. And you think we're tough!
779900 783654 We're going to make you more presentable<br />for your courtroom appearance.
784100 789618 Between now and then, you can just impress<br />the hell out of me by doing exactly as you're told.
794420 795933 Clean him up.
796700 801899 Preston, go over there<br />and get that hose ready, alright?
804620 808135 Holy shit, look at this!<br />What the hell's he been in to?
808580 810411 Who gives a shit?
810860 813738 Hands above your head and turn around.
817460 821578 Oh Christ, we should report this to Teasle.<br />Look at that!
822020 824534 You just do what I tell you.
828020 830170 Galt, what the fuck was that?
831060 833574 The man said 'clean him up'.
836300 838097 Clean him up!
846220 851738 Hey, Preston, don't forget<br />to get him behind the ears!
856900 858652 How'd you like that, huh?
859020 862490 What's the matter, Mitch,<br />don't you like water sports?
870340 875209 Hurry it up, it's time for my coffee break.<br />Alright, sit down.
875660 876615 Sit down!
884900 887414 Damn it, boy's hard to get a hold of!
888740 893450 That's OK, Ward, don't worry about the soap, he's tough.<br />Just shave him. Dry!
895020 900492 How blind are you? Can't you see he's crazy?<br />- Can't you see I don't give a shit?
900940 903215 Yeah, I can see that.<br />- That's better.
903660 906732 See there, I knew that you..
908260 912538 We're just going to shaving you partner, take it easy.<br />- Take this, Mitch.
916380 917335 Don't move...
918020 919931 I don't want you to cut your own throat.
934700 935576 You asshole!
954180 955738 What the hell...
1004780 1008534 I'll kill the asshole!<br />- Art, don't shoot!
1009220 1011973 There's people down there!<br />Get help! I'll go after him!
1015420 1017297 Get out of the way!
1112980 1115016 Son of a bitch!
1122620 1124497 Lester, this is Will. I'm right on his tail.
1124940 1127215 He's just east of Smith's farm,<br />headed towards Chapman Creek.
1203540 1205895 I know you can hear me!
1207060 1211497 You're finished!<br />You're gone as far as you're going to go!
1214940 1216532 D'you hear me?
1283500 1285809 He's up there behind the draw.
1286420 1291130 Mitch, get Orval on the radio. Tell him to get out<br />here with his damned dogs right away.
1291580 1295812 Tell him to bring the Dobermen! lt's gonna rain,<br />we need dogs that can hunt on sight.
1296260 1300094 Lester, tell Paul to get out to the<br />lumber camp to get the helicopter up here.
1300540 1304692 If they give him any shit, tell him to site<br />him for obstruction right on the spot.
1306780 1308532 We'll get him.
1308940 1310089 No problem.
1341540 1344338 Go on, Hooch! Thunder, lets get him!
1344780 1346577 Come on sweethearts
1347380 1349257 We'll get him!
1350700 1355216 Won't be long before he's stuffed and mounted.<br />- make him into a bear rug.
1355660 1359539 Didn't we go hunting here last year?<br />Ya I got a couple of bucks last year.
1359980 1361811 Mitch, up the hill!
1381460 1383928 Get these hounds away from me, Orval!<br />I don't trust those bastards.
1384380 1388055 Keep moving, my dogs can eat<br />and run at the same time!
1388500 1394177 He's going straight to the top.<br />- Isn't that supposed to be dangerous? - He's just dumb!
1410020 1414377 Hey, you're spoiling the scent.<br />Let my babies do their job!
1416940 1419295 This is no good.<br />- Why?
1419740 1424131 there were three of us in the cell block down there.<br />He went through us like we weren't even there.
1425460 1426859 Come on!
1495860 1500809 We've got him, he's trapped!<br />- Art, he's heading for Chapman's gorge.
1501260 1503137 Head him off!
1536660 1538332 There he is! On the cliff!
1555140 1556892 Son of a bitch!
1564100 1565328 What the hell's going on?
1565780 1568089 What are you doing?<br />We're just supposed to spot him!
1568540 1572249 Hold it steady.<br />- I can't, we're in a thermal draft.
1572700 1575612 He's stuck there, he can't go any place.
1576060 1581373 If you don't ride this thing right<br />I swear to God, I'll kill you!
1583500 1585092 Sheriff to Galt! Come in Galt.
1590100 1591533 Hold it steady, you son of a bitch!
1591980 1594210 Galt, come in, God damn it!
1595260 1599617 Get closer and hold it steady!<br />- Galt, talk to me! I want to know what's going on.
1648740 1649695 I got him... easy now.
1650300 1652894 Over there, dummy! Come on!
1657700 1659497 Hey, soldier boy!
1678660 1681299 Galt, get on this radio! What's going on up there?
1684500 1686616 I don't want him dead, Galt, I want him alive!<br />You hear me? Art, come in!
1744340 1747935 Art Galt, come in!<br />Helicopter, come, dammit!
1748580 1750377 Christ, look!
1752980 1755892 Jesus Christ, give me the binoculars!
1757340 1759729 Oh no! Shit!
1804100 1808776 - I can't figure it. How did fall out?<br />- Does it matter?
1809220 1811780 Let's nail this sucker's ass...<br />he can't be far.
1812300 1813255 Look!
1815700 1817975 Looks like he wants to turn himself in.
1819820 1825850 There's one man is dead. lt's not my fault.<br />I don't want any more hurt.
1826300 1827528 Freeze!
1827980 1830130 Stay there and give yourself up!
1830580 1832411 But I didn't do anything!
1832860 1835010 I'm warning you, boy, don't make a move, I'll blow your head off!
1835460 1837451 I didn't do anything!
1842500 1844297 Cease fire!
1845500 1847730 Ward, God damn it, cease fire!
1848980 1851892 I think we hit him.<br />Let's get down there. Move
1854260 1856216 Sheriff to base, come in.
1859780 1860735 Go ahead, Will?
1861180 1866618 Lester, we're down in the gorge. Galt's dead alright.<br />Where the hell is that god damned chopper?
1867060 1869972 He won't come, Will. Says there's a storm heading your way.
1870420 1874174 I don't give a god damned what's on its way.<br />I want the chopper back here right now!
1874620 1877498 I don't want Galt's body out here all night.
1877940 1880613 You sure picked one hell of a guy to mess around with.
1881060 1883893 Just came over the Teletype a few minutes ago.<br />John Rambo is a Vietnam vet,
1884340 1888015 A Green Beret, Congressional medal of honor.<br />Guy's a war hero.
1888540 1892055 - Jesus, that freak?<br />- I knew there was something about that guy!
1892780 1896090 I double checked it, Will.<br />What do you want me to do?
1900660 1905131 I want you to do what told you to do.<br />Dod damn it. Get that chopper back here now, out.
1908660 1909854 A Green Beret!
1910460 1911893 War hero!
1912540 1915657 - That's great! That's just great!<br />- Shut your mouth!
1916500 1919810 What the hell's the matter with you guys?<br />He's one man... wounded.
1920940 1924057 Those Green Berets... they're real bad asses.
1924500 1926092 Why don't you let the State Police handle this?
1931100 1933489 Look at him! Goddammit!
1934460 1937975 Look. Look at him!<br />That's Art Galt, boy!
1938460 1942055 He and I were friends when your momma<br />was still wiping your nose!
1942500 1946971 Now he's dead. Because of that psycho out there!<br />Now you listen good:
1947420 1952813 I'm gonna get that son of a bitch and I'm gonna pin<br />that Congressional medal of honor to his liver.
1953260 1957458 And I'm gonna do it with you or without you.
1975100 1980094 We're closin' in, the scent's getting<br />stronger. - Keep your eyes open.
1982940 1988412 It's going to storm, that's all we need now!<br />Will, let's get out of here before it gets dark.
1988860 1992535 What's the matter, you afraid of the boogie man?<br />You god damned pansy.
1992980 1995892 Put your gun down, I'll show you who the pansy is.
1997460 2002739 Knock it off! Ward, move out! The fight is out here!<br />He's out there waiting for you.
2003180 2005569 Mitch, get on your feet and move!
2006380 2010293 Go find this guy for Chrissakes!<br />Keep your eyes open!
2010740 2013857 See you later, Ward!<br />- Shut up, Mitch.
2021460 2022415 There he is!
2024300 2025779 Let them dogs loose, Orval!
2026220 2028529 Go get em sweethearts!<br />There's your dinner!
2039060 2040413 Cease fire!
2043860 2046374 Goddammit I'm hit!
2050300 2051733 Jesus, he's got a gun.
2059540 2062293 That's not him, it's a God damned scarecrow.
2062940 2066057 No scarecrow that shot Orville, he's close.
2066500 2069970 Kill him! Go get him!
2070420 2072536 Go get him, Maggie!
2083780 2087534 Mitch, Ward, come here!<br />Shingleton, you cover us.
2087980 2091689 Look at his leg! - Mitch, get your belt. Make a<br />tourniquet around that.
2092140 2095769 We got to get this guy to a doctor.<br />- Get your belt on that fast! Where's the first-aid kit?
2096220 2101010 I left it in the car. Shit! Where did he<br />get that gun? - It's Galt's gun.
2101460 2106739 He's out of ammo.. - How do you know that?<br />- Because whatever killed that dog was no bullet.
2107500 2110333 Orval, listen. You have to stay awake.
2110780 2115808 You have to release the tourniquet every 15 minutes.<br />We got to get him. He's out of ammo.
2116500 2121369 He had no right to shoot my babies.<br />Get the son of a bitch!
2122500 2125094 OK, listen up.
2125860 2128693 We're right on top of him. We're going to form<br />a skirmish line, 50 feet apart.
2129140 2131779 Keep moving, there's no way out of here, except through us.
2134620 2136895 OK, let's do some huntin'.
2137380 2141055 Huntin'?<br />We ain't huntin' him, he's huntin' us!
2154900 2158210 Spread out, dammit!<br />I said 50 feet!
2181620 2182973 I hate this!
2253700 2254689 Will, it's Mitch!
2262180 2263818 Who is it?
2291700 2293053 What's up here?<br />- Shut up!
2296620 2299817 He's got Ward.<br />Spread out, I'll go this way.
2313900 2315219 Who's firing?
2316540 2319452 Who's firing there?<br />- I got him!
2319900 2321731 Shingleton, follow me!
2322980 2324174 I got him!
2326340 2328012 Help me!
2328540 2330178 Help me, Will!
2334700 2337089 Balford? Where the hell are you?
2349340 2350898 Shingleton, over here!
2355140 2357335 Easy now.<br />- Get me out of here!
2366500 2369139 Shingleton, where the hell are you?
2391020 2394899 I could have killed them all.<br />I could have killed you.
2395260 2398218 In town you're the law, out here, it's me.
2398660 2400378 Don't push it.
2400820 2404529 Don't push it, or I'll give you a war<br />you won't believe.
2406580 2408332 Let it go.
2409180 2411216 Let it go.
2458740 2460412 Move back.
2472380 2474769 How bad is the situation? Captain...
2475220 2478656 That's the only good thing about this business,<br />is the business you're doing in town.
2479100 2481898 Reporters are drinking the place dry.
2484020 2488650 You look like you're ready to keel over, Will.<br />Why don't you go home. It's my problem now.
2489100 2494220 Your problem? Listen Dave, don't give me any of your horsehit<br />about jurisdiction in this one, you understand?
2494660 2498096 - Would you like me to step outside?<br />- Finish up what you're doing.
2498540 2502135 Somewhere in this rugged mountain countryside,<br />possibly above the snow line,
2502580 2505970 shrouded in mist,<br />the fugitive, John Rambo, is hiding.
2506420 2511210 Units of the state police along with local members<br />of the national guard are now being mobilized.
2511660 2516370 What still remains unexplained by the local authorities<br />is just how and where the former green beret<br />came into possession of the weapons
2516820 2520449 former Green Beret got the weapons<br />with which he allegedly killed one deputy sheriff
2520900 2525849 and tried to kill 6 others. Only their skilled training<br />in police enforcement techniques saved their lives.
2526300 2530339 And word now is that the fugitive will be<br />in custody an a matter of hours.
2531740 2532889 Maps Will.
2534460 2537054 Will, there's something you ought to know.
2537940 2539009 Talk to you later, OK?
2539460 2542258 What is it, Lester? Spit it out!
2544180 2546648 I was just talking to Mitch.
2547100 2551776 and he was saying that Galt and a couple<br />of deputies were a little hard on the guy.
2552220 2553733 Assholes!
2554300 2558851 Doesn't make one god dammed bit of difference.<br />Dave, and you know it!
2559300 2564579 If one of my deputies gets out of line with a<br />prisoner then the prisoner comes to me with it!
2565020 2567853 And if I find out it's like he says,<br />I kick the deputy's ass!
2568300 2570939 Me, the law!<br />And that's the way it's gotta be.
2571660 2575733 People start fucking around with<br />the law and all hell breaks loose.
2577140 2582772 - Whatever possessed God in heaven to make a man like Rambo?<br />- God didn't make Rambo,
2583220 2584539 I made him.
2584980 2586015 Who the hell are you?
2586460 2589532 Sam Trautman. Colonel Samuel Trautman.
2590220 2592176 We're a little busy this morning, colonel,<br />what can we do for you?
2592620 2594656 - I've come to get my boy.<br />- Your boy?
2595100 2599457 I recruited him, I trained him,<br />I commanded him in Vietnam for 3 years.
2599900 2601094 I'd say that makes him mine.
2601540 2606409 I wonder why the Pentagon would send<br />a full bird a colonel to handle this?
2606860 2608657 The army thought I might be able to help.
2609100 2612649 I don't know in what way. Rambo's<br />a civilian now, he's my problem.
2613820 2618177 I don't think you understand.<br />I didn't come here to rescue Rambo from you.
2618620 2620497 I came to rescue you from him.
2621740 2626256 Well, we all appreciate your concern, Colonel.<br />We'll try to be extra careful.
2627180 2631253 - I'm just amazed he allowed any of your posse to live.<br />- Is that right?
2631700 2634897 Strictly speaking, he slipped up.<br />You're lucky to be breathing.
2635340 2641017 Great! Colonel, you came out here to find out<br />why one of your machines blew a gasket.
2641500 2646051 You don't want to except the fact that you're<br />dealing with an expert in guerilla warfare.
2646500 2650937 With a man who's the best. With guns,<br />with knives, with his bare hands.
2651380 2655498 An man who was trained to<br />ignore pain, ignore weather,
2655940 2659933 To live off the land... to eat things<br />that would make a billy goat puke.
2660540 2665773 In Vietnam, his job was to dispose of<br />enemy personnel, to kill... period.
2666220 2670133 Win by attrition.<br />Well, Rambo was the best!
2723980 2729100 OK, Colonel, now you've got us all scared to death, what do you<br />and the special forces think
2729540 2732976 we do with the psycho out there?<br />- Let him go.
2733420 2735570 - Do what?<br />- For now.
2736020 2741048 Defuse the whole situation, defuse him.<br />Provide a little gap and let him slip through it.
2741500 2746051 In a couple of weeks you'll pick him up in Seattle or someplace,<br />working in a car wash.
2746500 2747853 There'll be no fight and nobody else will get hurt.
2748300 2753693 I do my own work. I don't figure the best way to do that is<br />to close my eyes and hope he gets picked up in Seattle!
2754140 2756096 If you send your people in there after him, they'll get killed.
2756540 2762775 We're just a small hick town sheriff's department,<br />colonel, but we're expected to do our duty<br />just like our heroes in the special forces.
2763220 2767736 - In Special Forces, we teach our people<br />to stay alive in the line of duty.<br />- No shit, I never thought of that!
2768180 2773413 - You want a war that you can't win?<br />- You telling me that 200 men against your boy<br />is a no win situation for us?
2773860 2779014 You send that many, don't forget one thing.<br />- What? - A good supply of body-bags!
2781715 2782715 Trautman...
2785180 2790300 I don't know which side you're on, Trautman,<br />I still think you came out here just to cover your ass.
2790740 2795336 But if you're serious about taking Rambo clean, follow me.
2814340 2817412 State police calling John Rambo.<br />Acknowledge.
2823820 2828291 State police calling John Rambo.<br />Come in please. Acknowledge!
2830540 2834215 If you're listening, Rambo, here's<br />your situation: you are surrounded,
2834660 2839575 Every possible exit has been blocked,<br />every highway, every road, every fire break.
2840020 2844889 You have our word that your services<br />to your country will be taken into consideration.<br />And you'll receive fair treatment.
2845340 2849891 - Just respond, we can work everything out... over<br />- Anything?
2850500 2853572 - He took a radio off one of my deputies.<br />- Then he has to be listening.
2854020 2858696 If I was in his position, I would try to pick up<br />some information. Maybe catch some cross talk.<br />- Of course he's listening!
2859140 2864089 - He's not going to break radio silence.<br />- No, not for us, but he might do it for you, Colonel.
2864700 2867214 He's your boy, isn't he?
2868540 2872897 maybe you can talk him into sparing<br />all our lives by giving himself up.
2873340 2874489 I can try.
2874940 2879775 At least we'd get a radio fix on his position<br />if you don't mind setting him up for us.
2880220 2883417 Setting him up for you?<br />That's like bringing the pigeons to the cat.
2887020 2890092 - Thanks for bringing your people out.<br />- Any time, Will.
2890540 2895056 Come on, Bobby, put the magazine away and pay attention.<br />We may only get one crack at this.
2899940 2903535 Company leader calling Raven.<br />Come on Raven.
2905580 2907889 Company leader calling Raven.
2911420 2914332 Company leader to Raven,<br />talk to me, Johnny.
2916300 2918689 Company leader to identify Baker Team:
2919140 2923418 Rambo, Messner, Ortega, Coletta,
2923860 2928729 Jorgensen, Danforth, Berry, Krakauer.
2929180 2930295 Confirm.
2930820 2932811 This is Colonel Trautman.
2934460 2936337 Talk to me, Johnny.
2949460 2951052 They're all gone, Sir.
2951500 2955254 - That's him, get on it.<br />- Rambo. Are you alright? Over.
2955700 2958009 Baker team, they're all dead, sir.
2958460 2961293 Not Delmare Berry, he made it.
2961740 2963696 Berry's gone too, sir.
2964540 2965495 How?
2966260 2970936 Got himself killed in 'Nam...<br />Didn't even know it. Cancer ate him down to the bone.
2972460 2974257 I'm sorry, I didn't know.
2975420 2977138 I'm the last one, sir.
2977820 2981574 It's good to hear your voice, Johnny,<br />it's been a long time.
2982620 2987569 Look, John, you've done some damage here, but they<br />don't want any more trouble. - He's North-west.
2988020 2991808 That's why I've come.<br />I'm gonna come in and fly you the hell out.
2992260 2996094 Just you and me. We'll work this out together.<br />Is that fair enough?
2997060 2999893 - Where'd you come from, Sir?<br />- Bragg.
3001340 3004412 I tried to get in touch with you but the guys<br />at Bragg never knew where to find you.
3004860 3009695 Well, I haven't been spending much time there lately,<br />they've got me down in DC. I'm shining a seat with my ass.
3010460 3012451 I wish I was back in Bragg now.
3015140 3019497 - We'll talk about that when you come in.<br />- I can't do that, Sir.
3021460 3024975 Well, look, John, we can't have you running around<br />out there wasting friendlies and civilians.
3025420 3029095 - There are no friendly civilians.<br />- I'm your friend, Johnny.
3029540 3034489 I was there with you, knee deep in blood and guts.<br />I covered your ass more than once.
3037340 3040252 Seems like bailing you out of trouble<br />is becoming a life long job for me.
3040700 3043089 There wouldn't be any trouble<br />if it wasn't for that king shit cop.
3043900 3046334 All I wanted was something to eat.
3046780 3051137 - But the man kept pushing sir.<br />- You did some pushing on your own, John.
3052220 3055451 They drew first blood, not me.
3055900 3057379 Let me come in and get you the hell out of there.
3059380 3061735 They drew first blood.
3070700 3072372 Rambo, are you still reading me?
3076500 3078092 Company leader to Raven!
3079380 3080893 Rambo, acknowledge!
3082020 3083931 He's finished, Colonel
3084620 3089011 We've got a real good fix on him though. Come first light,<br />I'm gonna put every man I got up on that ridge.
3089980 3091333 Then we'll get him my way.
3097140 3098334 Dammit.
3100340 3101329 God dammit!
3111060 3112732 Come on move it!
3117300 3119131 Does this guy got a gun?
3187260 3191139 There's the guy the cops are shootin' at.<br />- I see him! - I'll get him.
3191580 3192899 Don't shoot!
3193820 3195538 This way! Let's go!
3201420 3203456 There he is! Come on!
3219620 3221292 Now we got him!
3225060 3229975 Yes, I know exactly where it is.<br />Now listen to me very carefully!<br />Surround the area with every man you got, but don't move in.
3230420 3236609 Don't do anything till I get there!<br />And no shooting! I don't want him dead, I want him alive!
3253820 3255139 Keep firing!
3257460 3259291 Go on, guys, shoot!
3260460 3261859 Come on!
3263620 3265292 You guys are great!
3265740 3269972 Steve. I want you and Bruce, head around<br />these trees go to the front of that mine.
3270420 3273492 Screw that, Clinton, I ain't goin up there!<br />- No way!
3277580 3281732 Brandon, I want you to go into that mine.<br />- Not me.
3282540 3287978 What do you mean, not me?<br />- I do this part time, I didn't come here to get killed.<br />He's probably waiting for us.
3288420 3290615 What's wrong with you, Clinton?
3294300 3298213 Rambo?<br />This is Lieutenant Clinton Morgan.
3298980 3301574 National Guard leader.
3302020 3306457 I'm giving you just 3 zero seconds<br />to come on out.
3308220 3312008 Who's got the rocket launcher?<br />- I do. - Come here, Earl.
3314900 3317539 Rambo. This is your last chance to come out!
3318500 3320536 Maybe we should wait.
3320980 3325656 Earl, this creep is a killer! Besides,<br />I'm in charge and I say we blow it up.
3326100 3330252 Now fire that thing!<br />Just let me get out of the way first.
3353460 3355530 Give that man a cigar!
3355940 3357055 Bull's eye!
3395340 3398332 - Where the hell are they?<br />- Up the hill about 500 yards.
3401620 3403770 Move in a little closer just like Iwa Jima.
3405740 3408174 I don't believe it! Idiots!
3409060 3412370 One more for "Soldier of Fortune"!
3413340 3417538 What the hell do you think this is... some kind of circus?<br />Get the hell out of here!
3419060 3424134 Clinton, Jesus! Didn't you get the word, Clinton,<br />I told you people to wait until I got up here.
3424580 3428414 Well, he was shooting at us, Will!<br />I wasn't taking any chances.
3429940 3431896 What a mess.
3433380 3436338 We have to dig his body out of there right away.
3436780 3440170 You can't get a dozer up here,<br />you have to find somebody to dig him out.
3440620 3444932 - lt's your mess, Clinton! You clean it up.<br />- Will, come on... I gotta be back at the drug store tomorrow.
3445380 3448258 You'd better get started right away, Clinton!
3494740 3498130 Buried in a hole by a bunch of<br />God damned weekend warriors!
3498580 3500298 Thought you said he was the best you ever trained.
3501100 3504217 However he may have ended up, there<br />was a time when he was very special.
3504660 3509256 'Special' my ass. He's just another drifter that broke the law.<br />- Vagrancy, wasn't it?
3509700 3514012 That's gonna look real great on his gravestone<br />in Arlington: ''Here lies John Rambo,
3514460 3516178 winner of the Congressional medal of honor.
3516620 3519498 Survivor of countless incursions behind enemy lines,
3520660 3523333 killed for vagrancy in Jerkwater, USA''
3523780 3529491 Don't give me any of that crap, Trautman!<br />You think Rambo was the only guy<br />who had a tough time in Vietnam.
3529940 3534252 - He killed a police officer for Christ sake!<br />- You're god damned lucky he didn't kill all of you.
3551020 3556890 This character! He comes waltzing in here<br />full of all kinds of good advice.<br />I wish we'd let that god damned maniac go loose...
3557340 3562130 so we could save our own asses!<br />Well, we saved our asses, Colonel.<br />And we didn't let him go loose.
3562580 3566539 The best man lost!<br />And he doesn't like it!
3656100 3659331 - How are you doin', Will?<br />- Hold my calls.
3798980 3800299 Have a seat.
3805860 3810695 Miss, can you do this again, please.<br />- Sure. - And for my friend...?
3811140 3813574 A shot of wild turkey.
3815220 3819816 If I was out of line before,<br />I just want to apologize.
3821700 3824498 None of that makes much difference now, does it?
3826300 3828131 No, I guess not.
3829300 3830494 I suppose...
3832460 3834530 I just feel...
3836220 3839690 Like you were cheated out of your chance?
3840260 3842774 I wanted to kill that kid.
3843300 3846178 I wanted to kill him so bad, I could taste it.
3847500 3849331 Doesn't sit well with that badge.
3850380 3852848 It can get confusing sometimes.
3854820 3860133 In Vietnam you can bet that Rambo and I got pretty confused.<br />But we had orders.
3861620 3863929 When in doubt, kill.
3868180 3872312 But what the hell, you're a civilian. You can go home<br />to your wife, your house and flower garden.
3872860 3875718 You're under no pressure to figure all this out.
3876060 3880929 What about you colonel,<br />what did you figure out from all of this?<br />What would you have done with him if he came in?
3881460 3884258 Would you wrap your arms around him<br />give him a big sloppy kiss?
3884700 3887055 Or would you have blown his brains out?
3894540 3897452 I couldn't answer that until I met him face to face.
3900940 3902658 Well, there it is.
3904220 3906750 Just as well we never got a chance to find out.
4014100 4015089 Drive!
4017860 4021330 Don't look at me, look at the road.<br />That's how accidents happen.
4022660 4025618 What's your name?<br />- Cathcart, Robert A.
4026060 4029655 - What do you got in the back, Robert A.?<br />- M16s
4033020 4037457 OK, Robert A., get out of the truck.<br />- I don't got no beef with you.<br />- Go home!
4061620 4063895 Want to turn that up?
4067780 4070089 What's your story, Steamboat?
4070540 4076297 Looks like somebody pulled the plug too soon.<br />That Rambo guy? He's on the loose again.
4080100 4082898 Hey Will, it's Rambo! He's still around
4295060 4298609 - Holy fuck!<br />- Get out there right away. Move!
4323300 4325291 What the hell's going on?
4328060 4330972 Watch yourselves!<br />- They're all gonna blow!
4340300 4342530 Attention, all civilians!
4343380 4347214 For your own safety<br />please evacuate the streets immediately.
4348340 4352379 Remain indoors until you receive further instructions. I repeat:
4352820 4356733 This is a police emergency.<br />Please evacuate the streets immediately.
4374460 4376371 They found Rambo's body.
4376820 4381371 lt stole a truck and blew up a gas<br />station on the other side of town.
4382980 4384299 The kid is resilient.
4385540 4390898 Why don't you forget what you're thinking<br />and clear out while you can.<br />- Get the fuck out of here Trautman<br />and take your advice with you.
4391860 4395250 When I talked to earlier,<br />you knew he was still alive, didn't you?
4397380 4398529 I suspected it.
4399100 4403298 Sure, that's why you stuck around.<br />You trained him.
4403740 4406971 You taught him how to get out of places like that cave.
4407420 4409297 But he's not going to get out of this place.
4409740 4414291 Teasle, you and all your men couldn't handle him before,<br />what makes you think you can handle him now?
4414900 4417175 Because God knows what damage he's prepared to do.
4428380 4429699 You're going to die, Teasle.
4430500 4432092 Everybody dies!
4433100 4437252 There's only one man in this room that has a half a chance.<br />That's not because I'm better than he is.
4437700 4439133 But it's because he trusts me.
4439580 4443892 See, I'm the closest thing to family that he has left,<br />and that may be all the edge I need.
4444340 4446296 Jesus Christ, where do you people come from?
4451420 4454059 This is my job, Trautman,<br />this is my town!
4454460 4457975 I'm not giving it up to you,<br />or to Rambo or anybody else!
4458420 4460411 You just stay the hell out of my way!
4470460 4472132 - Get a little closer!<br />- I can't...
4472580 4474172 It's too God damned hot!
4475780 4477816 Will, it's Lester, do you copy, over?
4479540 4482771 Come on, let's go!<br />Will, this is Lester, do you copy, over?
4483700 4488091 We've got some serious problems.<br />The highway's been cut off.
4488540 4491657 The truck's out here,<br />but we couldn't find the body.
4492100 4495649 I repeat, no body, lt's totally burnt out.<br />Preston, get those people out of here...
4496620 4499612 Move them back to the south side.
4500060 4504690 We don't know how many gas tanks<br />there are under the pumps...
4841900 4844733 Go ahead, go ahead!
4845460 4848532 - Go ahead you crazy son of a bitch!<br />- Rambo!
4849460 4850939 Rambo, don't do it!
4851860 4853054 Listen to me, Rambo!
4853420 4855411 You have no chance.
4855860 4857532 Drop your weapon.
4858300 4860530 We're going to order a chopper in<br />and fly you back to Bragg.
4863820 4864889 Hold your fire!
4866820 4870210 - Yeah?<br />- Hold your fire!
4873340 4874614 Think about what you're doing.
4876700 4879851 The building's perimeter's covered.<br />No exits.
4880460 4883099 There's nearly 200 men out there and a lot of M16s!
4883540 4885849 You did everything to make this private war happen.
4886940 4891092 You've done enough damage!<br />This mission is over, you understand me?
4892740 4894332 This mission is over!
4897260 4899535 Look at them out there.
4901660 4902615 Look at them!
4905660 4908333 If you don't end this now,<br />they're going to kill you.
4908780 4910259 Is that what you want?
4913460 4916020 lt's over, Johnny. lt's over!
4916460 4921136 Nothing is over! Nothing!<br />You just don't turn it off!
4921580 4925129 lt wasn't my war.<br />You asked me, I didn't ask you!
4925580 4928731 I did everything I had to do to win,<br />but someone wouldn't let us win.
4929180 4933571 Then I come back to the world and I see all those<br />maggots at the airport protesting me, spitting.
4934020 4937933 Calling me baby killer and all that vile crap!
4938380 4943579 Who are they to protest me? Who are they?<br />Unless they've been me and been there and know<br />what the hell they're yelling about?
4944020 4947092 It was a bad time for everyone, Rambo,<br />it's all in the past now.
4947540 4952011 For you! For me, civilian life is nothing.<br />In the field, we had a code of honor.
4952460 4955452 You watch my back, I watch yours.<br />Back here, there's nothing!
4955900 4959131 You're the last of an elite group,<br />don't end it like this.
4959580 4963778 Back there I can fly a gun ship, I can drive a tank,<br />I was in charge of a million dollar equipment.
4964220 4967212 Back here I can't even hold a job parking cars!
4976740 4978651 Where is everybody?
4983740 4987096 I had a friend who was there for us.
4987980 4992132 There were all these guys, man.<br />Back there were all these fuckin guys!
4992580 4993615 who were my friends!
4994140 4998452 back here there's nothing!<br />Remember Dan Forest?
4998980 5002859 Wore this black headband.<br />I took one of his magic markers, and I said "if found...
5003300 5007293 mail this to Las Vegas",<br />because we were always talking about Vegas.
5007740 5013372 And this fucking car. this fucking 58 Chevy convertible<br />he was talking about his car<br />he said he would cruise till the tires fell off.
5021340 5026733 In one of these barns a kid came up<br />this kid carrying a shoe shine box.
5027180 5028249 "Shine please, shine?"
5029260 5032332 He kept on asking. Joe said ya.
5033340 5038130 I went to get a couple of beers.<br />And the box was wired. He opened up the box...
5038580 5041048 Fucking blew his body all over the place.
5041500 5045288 He's laying there and he's fucking screaming...<br />there's pieces of him all over me!
5045740 5049858 And I'm trying to pull them off, you know...<br />my friend! it's all over me!
5050300 5053656 I got blood and everything and...<br />I'm trying to hold him together, I put him together
5054100 5055977 the fucking entrails keep coming out!
5056420 5058172 And nobody would help!
5058620 5062533 They only go "I want to go home!"<br />just calling my name.
5062980 5065574 "I want to go home, Johnny!<br />I want to drive my Chevy!
5066020 5067817 But I couldn't find his legs.
5068580 5071219 "I can't find your legs!"
5071660 5076097 I can't get it out of my head.<br />It was seven years.
5076540 5078019 Every day it hurts.
5078460 5083329 Sometimes I wake up and don't know<br />where I am. I don't talk to anybody.
5084860 5086691 Sometimes a day.
5088380 5090132 Sometimes a week.
5091300 5093814 I can't put it out of my mind.
