134600 138455 Excuse me, can you tell me<br />this, where Delmare Berry lives?
139414 140712 He ain't here.
141791 143129 Go on inside, baby.
149030 149830 He's a friend of mine...
150903 155196 Well in fact, he wrote his<br />address down...right here.
156695 157893 Here.
158133 160390 You can see that's Delmare's writing.
160591 162448 I sure had a hard<br />time finding this place!
162828 165943 - That's his writing.<br />- Like I said, he's a friend.
166622 170419 My name is John Rambo. We served<br />on the same team together in Nam.
170857 172776 I don't know if he<br />ever talked about me...
174215 177529 I have got a picture of us together.
178848 179766 Somewhere...
180606 182285 This junk in my pocket!
183323 184962 Here...here it is.
185602 190077 That's me, that's Danforth,<br />Westmore, Bronson, Ortega,
190556 192333 and there's Delmare, right in the back.
192333 194111 We had to put him in the<br />back because he's so big,
194111 196288 if we didn't, he'd take<br />up the whole picture!
196288 197727 Delmare's gone.
199586 202440 - What time will he be back?<br />- He died.
203020 203738 What?
205097 206557 Died last summer.
208295 209713 Died how?
210373 213568 Cancer. Brought it back from Nam.
214608 216944 All that orange stuff<br />they spread it around.
218564 222758 Cut him down to nothing. I<br />couldn't lift him off the sheet.
232227 233526 I am very sorry.
287444 289421 Morning Amy! How are you doing, girls?
289421 291399 - Great, thanks.<br />- Alright this morning?

337586 339703 you're asking for<br />trouble around here, friend!
341342 344738 - Headed North or South?<br />- North.

361279 363636 - Where you heading?<br />- Portland.
364076 366594 Portland is South, you said<br />you were headed North.
367911 369789 You got some place I<br />can eat around here?
371908 374405 There's a diner about<br />30 miles up the highway.
376940 379457 Is there a law against me<br />getting something to eat here?
379457 380675 Yeah, me.
382815 384293 Why are you pushing me?
385931 387288 What did you say?
388727 390525 l said why are you pushing me,<br />I haven't done anything to you.
390765 393921 First of all, you don't ask the<br />questions around here, I do. Understand?
394401 399396 Secondly...we don't want<br />guys like you in this town.
401113 402670 Drifters.
402670 404108 First thing you know<br />we got a whole bunch
404108 406507 of guys like you in<br />this town. That's why!
408305 409901 Besides, you wouldn't like it here...
411902 413498 It's a quiet little town.
414937 416415 In fact, you might say it's boring!
417516 418993 But that's the way we like it.
420672 422709 And I get paid to keep it that way.
424108 425086 Boring...
440569 441827 Portland, straight ahead!
444644 446082 If you want some friendly advice...
447361 451076 Get your hair cut and take a bath.<br />You wouldn't get hassled so much!
451556 453293 Hope this ride helped you out!
459467 461186 Have a nice day, huh!
498103 499941 Where the hell do<br />you think you're going?
501458 502895 Hey, I am talking to you, goddamn it!
508171 509150 Let's see some I.D.!
510968 512405 All right, you're under arrest!
513044 514723 You hear me? You put<br />your hands on the car.
515163 517640 Now you put your hands on<br />the car, and you spread them.
519479 521815 Are you going to put<br />your hands on that car?
522395 524392 How you do it, you<br />decide, right now!
537539 539056 Put your legs back.
540094 541032 Back!
543850 546287 You try to be nice to some people!
550204 552280 Well, what do we have here, huh?
555957 557675 What would you be<br />carrying a knife like this?
558676 559493 Hunting.
560551 563468 Don't be a wise guy! What<br />do you hunt with a knife?
565369 566185 Name it.
571619 573457 - Hi, Will.<br />- Lester.
573936 575673 Harry, buzz us in, will you?
576174 578410 Hey, talk about your<br />sorry looking humanity!

587559 589476 I want you to book<br />this gentleman for
589476 593394 vagrancy, resisting arrest,<br />carrying a concealed weapon.
593874 595251 He says he uses it for hunting.
596252 598428 Hunting? What do you hunt, elephants?
598907 602263 See if you can clean him up a<br />little. He smells like an animal!
607617 609535 Hey, Mitch...Mitch!

631878 633825 about 10 years to paint this hall!
634123 636123 Why don't you paint it your damned self?
636123 637962 Come on Leroy, sling that paint, boy!

716612 718630 I promise you're going to<br />talk to me, soldier.
720927 722884 I am starting to dislike you.
724543 725640 A lot.
727559 729517 I am going to run a make on him.
731554 733711 Put his name in the Teletype.
734751 737028 Just roll it across.
737468 738865 Roll it across!
740344 741581 Push it.
741581 744119 It won't work that way, it will<br />only smear. Roll it across!
745299 746956 Look, you son of a<br />bitch, if you don't put your
746956 749213 goddamned hand down<br />there, I am going to break it off!
749653 753489 - Put it down, goddamn it!<br />- Art, what the hell's going on down here?
753968 755566 Nothing I can't handle.
756926 758202 He won't let us print him well.
759103 760679 Leave the ink on your hand!
762758 764415 Just what is your problem, huh?
765555 767632 Listen, hardass! As<br />things stand right now,
767632 770110 you're facing the ass end<br />of a 90 day incarceration!
770110 774245 Plus a 250 dollars fine, which you<br />don't look to me like you can pay!
775224 777041 At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning,<br />you're going up in front of that judge.
777842 779059 And you think we're tough!

781817 783396 for your courtroom appearance.
784694 786850 Between now and then, you can<br />just impress the hell out of me
786850 789107 by doing exactly as you're told.
795001 796220 Clean him up.
797140 799217 All right, Preston,<br />I want you to go
799217 801794 over there and get that<br />hose ready, alright?

836934 838292 Clean him up!
846883 852356 Hey, Preston, don't forget<br />to get him behind the ears!
857512 859269 How'd you like that, huh?
859668 863104 What's the matter, Mitch?<br />Don't you like water sports?
870936 875809 All right, hurry it up, it's time for<br />my coffee break. Alright, sit down!

891712 893569 Just shave him. Dry!
893770 894370 All right...
896166 898882 How blind are you? Can't<br />you see this guy's crazy?

1016088 1017526 Get out of the way!
1113653 1114953 Son of a bitch!
1123185 1125022 Lester, this is Will.<br />I am right on his tail.
1125502 1127740 He's just east of Smith's farm,<br />headed towards Chapman Creek.
1204009 1205409 I know you can hear me!
1207568 1208718 You're finished!
1210319 1213068 You have gone as far as you're going to go!
1215676 1217076 Do you hear me?
1280277 1280977 Mitch!
1281577 1282377 Lester!
1283879 1285557 He's up there behind the draw.
1286456 1288314 Mitch, get Orval on the radio.
1289215 1291772 Tell him to get out here with<br />his damned dogs right away.
1292251 1293748 And tell him to bring the Dobermen!
1294349 1296045 lt's going to rain, we will need<br />dogs that can hunt on sight.
1296884 1298802 Lester, tell Paul to get<br />out to the lumber camp
1298802 1300221 to get the helicopter up here.
1301200 1302257 If they give him any shit, tell him to
1302257 1304915 site him for obstruction<br />right on the spot.
1307416 1308416 We will get him!
1309192 1311192 No problem.
1342194 1344390 Go on, Hooch! Thunder, lets get him!

1348026 1349305 Let's go get him, babies!
1351382 1354220 Won't be long before he's<br />stuffed and mounted, huh Will?
1355121 1356058 Make him into a bear rug!
1356338 1357755 Didn't we go hunting here up last year?
1357755 1359572 Yeah, I got a couple of bucks last year!
1360651 1362449 Hey Mitch, up the hill!
1382107 1384585 Get those hounds away from me,<br />Orval! I don't trust those bastards!
1385064 1388700 Keep moving, my dogs can<br />eat and run at the same time!
1389139 1390675 He's going straight to the top.
1391976 1393394 Isn't that supposed to be dangerous?
1393394 1394612 He's just dumb!
1410675 1414029 Hey, you're spoiling the scent.<br />Let my babies do their job!
1417943 1419443 - This is no good.<br />- Why?
1420424 1422401 There were three of us in<br />the cell block down there!
1422602 1424478 He went through us like<br />we weren't even there!
1426097 1427074 Oh, come on!
1496496 1498873 We have got him, go ahead, he's trapped!
1498873 1501351 Art, Art! This is Teasle, he's<br />heading for Chapman's gorge.
1501930 1503368 Chapman's gorge! Head him off!
1537289 1539007 There he is! On the cliff!
1555787 1557145 Son of a bitch!
1565178 1566378 What the hell's going on?
1566378 1568731 What are you doing? We're<br />just supposed to spot him!
1569211 1572928 - Hold it steady.<br />- I can't! We're in a thermal draft!
1573407 1576285 He's stuck there, he can't go any place.
1576765 1582136 If you don't ride this thing right,<br />I swear to God, I will kill you!
1584195 1585754 Sheriff to Galt! Come in Galt.
1590748 1592285 Hold it steady, you son of a bitch!
1592665 1594863 Galt, come in, goddamn it!

1650997 1653555 Over there, dummy! Come on!
1658349 1659647 Hey, soldier boy!
1679324 1682662 Galt, I am telling you to get on this<br />radio! What's going on up there?
1685167 1687667 I don't want him dead, Galt,<br />I want him alive! You hear me?
1687667 1688668 Art, come in!
1746005 1748305 Art Galt, come in!<br />Helicopter, come in, goddamn it!
1749444 1750444 Christ, look!
1753941 1756857 Jesus Christ, give me the binoculars!
1758336 1760692 Oh no, no, no! Shit!
1805654 1807754 I can't figure it...How did he fall out?
1809055 1809954 Does it matter?
1810197 1812754 Let's nail this sucker's<br />ass...He can't be far!
1813113 1814011 Will!
1816445 1818445 Looks like he wants to turn himself in!
1820324 1826417 There's one man dead. lt's not my<br />fault. I don't want any more hurt.
1826797 1828435 Freeze!
1828435 1830592 Stay right where you<br />are and give yourself up!
1831032 1832868 But I didn't do anything!
1833348 1835966 I am warning you, boy, don't make<br />a move, I will blow your head off!
1835966 1837443 I didn't do anything!
1842978 1845176 Cease fire! Cease fire!
1846014 1848211 Ward, goddamn it, cease fire!
1850366 1852766 I think we hit him. Let<br />us get down there. Move!
1855244 1856844 Sheriff to base, come in.
1860799 1861399 Go ahead, Will.
1861837 1863385 Lester, we're down in the gorge.
1864535 1867331 Galt's dead, alright? Where the<br />hell is that goddamned chopper?
1867826 1870726 He won't come, Will. Says<br />there's a storm heading your way.
1871221 1873121 I don't give a goddamned<br />what's on its way.
1873121 1874821 I want that chopper back here right now!
1875377 1877577 I don't want Gault's<br />body out here all night.
1877577 1881255 Listen, Will. You sure picked one<br />hell of a guy to mess around with!
1881255 1882781 Just came over the<br />Teletype a few minutes ago.
1882781 1884231 John Rambo is a Vietnam vet.
1884647 1888647 He's a Green Beret, Congressional<br />Medal of Honor! Guy's a war hero!
1888647 1890443 Jesus, that freak?!
1890443 1892681 I knew there was<br />something about that guy!
1893418 1896418 I double checked it, Will.<br />What do you want me to do?
1900887 1903087 I want you to do what I<br />told you to do, goddamn it!
1903087 1905487 Get that chopper back here now! Out.
1909102 1910602 Green Beret!
1910903 1913103 War hero!
1913103 1915793 - That's great! That's just great!<br />- Shut your mouth!
1916950 1917950 What the hell's the<br />matter with you guys?
1917950 1920250 He's one man...wounded!
1921683 1924683 Those Green Berets...they're<br />real bad asses.
1925124 1926924 Why don't you let the<br />State Police handle this?
1935630 1937630 Look. Look at him...look at<br />him! That's Art Gault, boy!
1938149 1940427 He and I were friends when your
1940427 1942705 momma was still wiping your nose!
1943445 1946595 Now he's dead. He's dead!<br />Because of that psycho out there!
1946595 1947945 Now you listen boy,<br />you listen to me good:
1947945 1949450 I am going to get that son of a bitch...
1949951 1952750 and I am going to pin that Congressional<br />Medal of Honor to his liver!
1954086 1955086 And I am going to do it,
1955588 1958088 with you, or without you!
1975737 1977737 We're closing in, the<br />scent's getting stronger.
1978338 1979737 All right, keep your eyes open!
1984049 1986549 It's going to storm...it's all we need now!
1986549 1989049 Will, come on, let's get out of<br />here before it gets too dark.
1989049 1990865 What's the matter, you<br />afraid of the boogie man?
1990865 1992165 You goddamned pansy!
1994580 1996580 Put your gun down, I will<br />show you who the pansy is!
1998392 2000892 Knock it off! Ward! Ward, move out!
2000892 2003392 The fight is out here! He's<br />out there waiting for you.
2004069 2006069 Mitch, get on your feet and move!
2007946 2010946 Go find this guy for Chrissakes!<br />Keep your eyes open!
2011502 2013502 - I will see you later, Ward!<br />- Shut up, Mitch.
2021969 2022969 There he is!
2024889 2026465 Let them dogs loose, Orval!
2027166 2029166 Go get him sweethearts!<br />Here's your dinner!
2037713 2039710 Cease fire!
2045026 2046526 Goddamn it, I am hit!
2048981 2051577 Jesus, he's got a gun..
2060605 2062805 It's not him, it's a<br />goddamned scarecrow!
2063720 2065620 No scarecrow that<br />shot Orville, he's close.
2068076 2069076 Kill him! Go get him!
2070195 2072195 Go get him, Maggie!
2084461 2088178 Mitch, Ward, come here!<br />Shingleton, you cover us.
2088811 2090811 Look at his leg!
2090811 2092411 Mitch, get your belt. Make<br />a tourniquet around that.
2092887 2094337 We got to get this guy to a doctor!
2094337 2096687 Goddamn it, get your belt on that<br />fast! Where's the first-aid kit?
2096687 2097680 I left it in the car.
2098081 2098681 Shit!
2098681 2101380 - Where did he get that gun?<br />- It's got to be Art Gault's gun.
2101380 2103407 - He's out of ammo...<br />- How do you know that?
2103708 2106195 Because whatever killed Orval's<br />dog was no bullet, that's how!
2106894 2108892 Hurry up! Orval, listen<br />to me, now listen!
2109393 2110691 You have to stay awake, all right?
2110961 2113011 You have to release that<br />tourniquet every 15 minutes.
2113011 2115861 We will be right back! We go<br />get him now, he's out of ammo.
2116816 2119816 Get him! He had no right to shoot<br />my babies. Get the son of a bitch!
2119816 2121236 - Let's go!<br />- Go get him!
2123293 2125730 All right, now listen up!
2126331 2127381 We're right on top of him.
2127381 2129331 We're going to form a<br />skirmish line, 50 feet apart.
2129331 2131706 Keep moving, there's no way<br />out of here, except through us.
2135513 2137513 OK, let's do some hunting...
2138116 2141016 Hunting? We ain't<br />hunting him, he's hunting us!
2155556 2158256 Spread out. Spread out,<br />damn it! I said 50 feet!
2182570 2183570 I hate this!
2254606 2255606 Will, it's Mitch!
2262855 2263755 Who is it?
2292399 2293799 - What's going on?<br />- Shut up!
2297192 2299692 He's got Ward. Spread<br />out, I will go this way.
2309295 2310295 Will! Over here!
2314755 2315655 Who's firing?
2317289 2318289 Who's firing?
2318490 2319588 I got him!
2320327 2321624 Shingleton, follow me!
2326920 2328318 Will, help me!
2329520 2330520 Help me, Will!
2336471 2337971 Balford? Where the hell are you?!
2349756 2350556 Shingleton, over here!
2367116 2368516 Shingleton, where the hell are you?!
2391844 2394944 I could have killed them all.<br />I could have killed you.
2396100 2398200 In town you're the law,<br />out here, it's me!
2399297 2403713 Don't push it! Don't push it, or I will<br />give you a war you won't believe!
2406809 2407809 Let it go.
2409884 2410884 Let it go.
2459191 2460670 Move back, you guys, move back!
2472773 2475173 How bad is the situation?<br />Captain, we need some...
2476088 2477588 That's the only good thing about this,
2477588 2479088 is the business you're doing in town!
2479885 2481885 Reporters are drinking the place dry.
2484233 2486283 You look like you're<br />ready to keel over, Will.
2486984 2489233 Why don't you go<br />home? It's my problem now.
2489233 2491728 Your problem? Listen Dave,<br />don't give me any of your
2491728 2494428 horseshit about jurisdiction<br />in this one, you understand?
2495105 2497605 - Should I step outside?<br />- Just finish up what you're doing.
2499080 2502380 Somewhere in this rugged mountain<br />countryside, possibly above the snow line,
2503478 2506478 shrouded in mist, the<br />fugitive John Rambo, is hiding.
2506478 2507814 Units of the state<br />police along with local
2507814 2511711 members of the National<br />Guard are now being mobilized.
2512301 2514651 What still remains<br />unexplained by local authorities
2514651 2516501 is just how and where<br />the former Green Beret
2516940 2518140 came into possession of the weapons
2518140 2520941 with which he allegedly<br />killed one deputy sheriff,
2521332 2522632 and tried to kill 6 others.
2522934 2524734 Only their skilled training<br />in police enforcement
2524734 2526534 techniques saved their lives.
2526534 2528459 And word now is that<br />the fugitive will be
2528459 2530509 in custody in a matter of hours.
2532504 2533660 Maps, Will.
2535061 2537361 Will, there's something<br />I think you ought to know.
2538420 2539720 I will talk to you later, OK?
2540171 2542271 What is it, Lester? What is it<br />for Christ sake, spit it out!
2545090 2548427 Well, I was just talking to<br />Mitch, and he was saying that
2548427 2552164 Gault and a couple of deputies<br />were...a little hard on the guy.
2552723 2553723 Assholes!
2554835 2558035 It doesn't make one goddamned bit<br />of difference, Dave, and you know it!
2560187 2563837 If one of my deputies...gets<br />out of line with a prisoner,
2563837 2565187 then the prisoner<br />comes to me with it!
2565868 2568068 And if I find out it's like he<br />says, I kick the deputy's ass!
2568068 2570442 Me, the law! That's<br />the way it's got to be.
2572336 2575536 People start fucking around with<br />the law, and all hell breaks loose.
2578768 2580468 Whatever possessed God in<br />heaven to make a man like Rambo?
2581169 2582468 God didn't make Rambo.
2583926 2584926 I made him.
2585445 2586445 Who the hell are you?
2587019 2589719 Sam Trautman. Colonel Samuel Trautman.
2590735 2593135 We're a little busy this morning,<br />Colonel, what can I do for you?
2593135 2594966 - I have come to get my boy.<br />- Your boy?
2595568 2599368 I recruited him, I trained him, I<br />commanded him in Vietnam for 3 years.
2600519 2601519 I'd say that makes him mine.
2601820 2604020 I wonder why the Pentagon would
2604020 2606920 send a full bird Colonel to handle this?
2607761 2609761 The army thought I<br />might be able to help.
2609761 2611555 I don't know in what way.
2611555 2613255 Rambo's a civilian now, he's my problem.
2614745 2618645 I don't think you understand. I didn't<br />come here to rescue Rambo from you.
2618863 2620863 I came here to rescue you from him.
2622336 2624436 Well, we all appreciate<br />your concern, Colonel.
2625137 2626636 We will try to be extra careful!
2627811 2630111 I am just amazed he allowed<br />any of your posse to live.
2630912 2631811 Is that right?
2632186 2635486 Strictly speaking, he slipped up.<br />You're lucky to be breathing!
2635486 2636487 That's just great!
2638088 2638805 Colonel, you came out here
2638805 2641422 to find out why one of<br />your machines blew a gasket!
2642041 2643948 You don't seem to want to<br />accept the fact that you're
2643948 2646456 dealing with an expert<br />in guerilla warfare.
2647096 2648413 With a man who's the best.
2648814 2651030 With guns, with knives,<br />with his bare hands.
2651669 2655385 A man who's been trained to<br />ignore pain, ignore weather.
2656225 2658122 To live off the land...
2658122 2660420 To eat things that would<br />make a billy goat puke.
2661359 2665494 In Vietnam, his job was to dispose<br />of enemy personnel, to kill...period!
2666373 2670249 Win by attrition. Well,<br />Rambo was the best!
2724106 2726383 OK, Colonel, now you have<br />got us all scared to death.
2726383 2728660 What do you and the Special Forces think
2728660 2730928 I ought to do about your psycho out there?
2732729 2733697 Let him go.
2733697 2735392 - Do what?<br />- For now.
2736732 2738649 Defuse the whole situation, defuse him.
2739450 2741666 Provide a little gap and<br />let him slip through it.
2742146 2744903 Then put out a nation wide<br />APB. In a couple of weeks,
2744903 2747560 you will pick him up in Seattle or<br />someplace, working in a car wash.
2747560 2748998 There will be no fight and<br />nobody else will get hurt.
2748998 2751514 I do my own work. I don't<br />figure the best way to do that is
2751514 2754092 to close my eyes and then hope<br />he gets picked up in Seattle!
2754872 2756890 If you send your people in<br />there after him, they will get killed!
2756890 2759485 You know, we're just a small<br />hick town Sheriff's department,
2759485 2761501 Colonel, but we're<br />expected to do our duty
2761501 2763537 just like our heroes<br />in the Special Forces.
2763757 2766857 In Special Forces, we teach our<br />people to stay alive in the line of duty.
2767358 2768758 No shit, I never thought of that!
2768758 2769812 You want a war you can't win?
2769812 2773928 Are you telling me that 200 men against<br />your boy is a no win situation for us?
2774224 2775874 You send that many,<br />don't forget one thing.
2775874 2776824 What?
2777124 2778724 A good supply of body-bags!
2782160 2783257 Trautman!
2785975 2787712 I don't know which side<br />you're on, Trautman...
2788313 2790650 I still think you came out<br />here just to cover your ass.
2791029 2794964 But if you're serious about taking<br />Rambo out clean, follow me...
2815422 2818498 State police calling John<br />Rambo. Acknowledge.
2824631 2829405 State police calling John Rambo.<br />Come in please. Acknowledge!
2831184 2834818 If you're listening, Rambo, here's<br />your situation: you are surrounded.
2834818 2837515 Every possible exit has been blocked,
2837515 2839973 every highway, every<br />road, every fire break.
2840187 2841837 You have our word that<br />your services to your
2841837 2843487 country will be taken<br />into consideration.
2843487 2845164 And you will receive fair treatment.
2845465 2848422 Just respond, we can<br />work everything out...over.
2849223 2849980 Anything?
2850580 2854057 - He took a radio off one of my deputies.<br />- Then he has to be listening.
2854671 2855971 If I was in his position,<br />I'd try to pick up
2855971 2858271 some information. Maybe<br />catch some cross talk.
2858772 2859572 Of course, he's listening.
2859806 2861206 He's not going to break radio silence.
2861206 2864206 No, not for us, but he<br />might do it for you, Colonel.
2864844 2866321 He's your boy, isn't he?
2869080 2872593 Maybe you can talk him into sparing<br />all our lives by giving himself up.
2873473 2874492 I can try.
2875072 2877350 At least, we'd get a<br />radio fix on his position,
2877350 2878729 if you don't mind<br />setting him up for us...
2878729 2880135 Setting him up for you?
2880836 2882602 It's like bringing the<br />pigeons to the cat!
2888338 2889856 Thanks for bringing your people out.
2889856 2890774 Any time, Will.
2890774 2892911 Come on, Bobby, put the<br />magazine away, will you?
2892911 2895468 Pay attention. I mean we<br />may only get one crack at this.
2900403 2903299 Company leader calling<br />Raven. Come on Raven.
2906016 2907471 Company leader calling Raven.
2911808 2914803 Company leader to<br />Raven. Talk to me, Johnny.
2916962 2919158 Company leader to identify Baker Team:
2920098 2924373 Rambo, Messner, Ortega, Coletta,
2924373 2928927 Jorgensen, Danforth, Berry, Krakauer.
2929606 2930424 Confirm.
2931305 2932501 This is Colonel Trautman.
2934680 2935917 Talk to me, Johnny.
2950423 2952021 They're all gone, Sir.
2952501 2956116 - That's him, get on it.<br />- Rambo. Are you alright? Over.
2956116 2957873 Baker team, they're all dead, Sir.
2959152 2961789 Not Delmare Berry, he made it.
2962269 2963787 Berry's gone too, Sir.
2965166 2966064 How?
2966743 2968381 Got himself killed in Nam...
2968381 2971719 Didn't even know it. Cancer<br />ate him down to the bone.
2972976 2974735 I am sorry, I didn't know.
2975934 2977511 I am the last one, Sir.
2978330 2981246 lt's good to hear your voice,<br />Johnny. It's been a long time!
2983125 2985582 Look, John, you have<br />done some damage here,
2985582 2986539 but they don't want any more trouble.
2986539 2987940 He's north-west!
2988478 2989976 That's why I have come.
2991177 2992774 I am going to come in<br />and fly you the hell out.
2992774 2996589 Just you and me. We will work this<br />out together. Is that fair enough?
2997548 2998766 Where'd you come from, Sir?
2999167 3000185 Bragg.
3001864 3002981 I tried to get in touch with you,
3002981 3005099 but the guys at Bragg<br />never knew where to find you.
3005099 3007376 Well, I haven't been spending<br />much time there lately,
3007376 3010374 they have got me down in DC.<br />I am shining a seat with my ass.
3010973 3012731 I wish I was back in Bragg now.
3015608 3017385 We will talk about that when you come in.
3017385 3018963 I can't do that, Sir.
3021920 3024128 Well, look, John, we can't have<br />you running around out there,
3024128 3025536 wasting friendly civilians.
3026155 3028991 - There are no friendly civilians.<br />- I am your friend, Johnny.
3030031 3032258 I was there with you, knee<br />deep in blood and guts.
3033259 3034985 I covered your ass more than once!
3037863 3039150 Seems like bailing you out of trouble
3039150 3040738 is becoming a lifetime job for me!
3040738 3043475 There wouldn't be no trouble<br />except for that king shit cop!
3044514 3045812 All I wanted was something to eat.
3047291 3048949 But the man kept pushing, Sir.
3049950 3051707 Well, you did some<br />pushing on your own, John!
3052725 3054221 They drew first blood, not me.
3054221 3055200 Look Johnny...
3056401 3058216 Let me come in, and get<br />you the hell out of there.
3060276 3062234 They drew first blood...
3069623 3072362 Rambo! Are you still reading me?
3076976 3078574 Company leader to Raven!
3079852 3081072 Rambo, acknowledge!
3082591 3084009 He's all finished, Colonel!
3085128 3086905 We have got a real good fix on him now.
3087306 3089682 Come first light, I am going to put<br />every man I got upon that ridge.
3090481 3092059 Then we will get him my way!
3097633 3099231 Goddamn it.
3100829 3101667 Goddamn it!
3111537 3113216 Come on, move it!
3115017 3115817 Let's go!
3117770 3119408 Does this guy got a gun?
3187470 3188657 There's the guy the<br />cops are shooting at!
3188657 3191545 I see him over there,<br />I will get him, I will get him!
3192025 3193182 Don't shoot!
3194363 3195439 This way! Let's go!
3201952 3203452 There he is! Come on!
3220093 3221771 Now we got him!
3225567 3228224 Yes, I know exactly where it is.<br />Now listen to me very carefully.
3228725 3230781 Surround the area with every<br />man you have got, but don't move in.
3230781 3232082 I repeat: don't move in!
3232082 3234917 Don't do anything till I get<br />there! And no shooting!
3235118 3236614 I don't want him dead, I want him alive!
3253833 3255511 Keep firing!
3257469 3259307 Come on guys, shoot!
3261105 3262304 Come on!
3264521 3265699 You guys are great!
3266779 3267876 - All right, Steve.<br />- Yo!
3268377 3269575 I want you and Bruce,<br />head around these trees,
3269575 3270674 go to the front of that mine.
3270674 3272602 Screw that Clint, but<br />I ain't going up there!
3272602 3273490 No way!
3278104 3279221 - Brandon?<br />- What?
3280122 3282722 - I want you to go into that mine.<br />- No, not me!
3282722 3283659 What do you mean, not me?!
3284060 3286257 Look, I do this part time, I<br />didn't come here to get killed.
3286458 3289054 He's probably just waiting for us!
3289054 3290431 What's wrong with you, Clinton?
3294847 3298622 Rambo! This is<br />Lieutenant Clinton Morgan.
3299381 3300978 National Guard leader.
3302418 3306652 And I am giving you just<br />3.0 seconds to come on out.
3308651 3310528 Who's got the rocket launcher?
3311029 3312406 - I do.<br />- Come here, Earl.
3312406 3313307 Right!
3314282 3317720 Rambo! This is your<br />last chance to come out.
3318779 3320516 Maybe we should wait.
3320956 3323313 Earl, this creep is a killer!
3323313 3325871 Besides, I am in charge<br />and I say we blow it up!
3326109 3329665 Now fire that thing! Just let<br />me get out of the way first.
3354338 3355516 Give that man a cigar!
3356216 3357415 Bull's eye!
3395890 3398847 - Where the hell are they?<br />- Up the hill about 500 yards.
3402123 3403981 Move in a little closer,<br />just like Iwa Jima.
3406278 3408675 I don't believe it! Idiots!
3409555 3411809 All right, one more for<br />"Soldier of Fortune"!
3411809 3412910 Soldier of Fortune?!
3413369 3416347 Damn it, what the hell do you<br />think this is, some kind of a circus?
3416347 3417725 Get the hell out of here!
3419843 3420600 Clinton, Jesus!
3421601 3422979 Didn't you get the word, Clinton?
3422979 3424858 I told you people to<br />wait until I got up here!
3424858 3426214 Well, he was shooting at us, Will!
3426214 3428432 Come on! I wasn't taking any chances.
3430950 3431907 What a mess!
3434087 3436444 We have to dig his body<br />out of there right away.
3437522 3439200 You can't get a dozer up here,
3439200 3440979 you're going to have to find<br />somebody to dig him out!
3441357 3442895 lt's your mess, Clinton!<br />You clean it up.
3443296 3445833 Will, come on...I got to be back<br />at the drug store tomorrow!
3445833 3448251 You'd better get started<br />right away, Clinton!
3451252 3452252 Shit!
3495474 3497950 Buried in a hole by a bunch of<br />goddamned weekend warriors!
3499389 3500887 Thought you said he was<br />the best you ever trained!
3501827 3503084 However he may have ended up,
3503084 3504842 there was a time when<br />he was very special.
3505183 3508090 'Special', my ass! He was just<br />another drifter that broke the law.
3508090 3509598 Vagrancy, wasn't it?
3510037 3512794 That's going to look real good on<br />his gravestone in Arlington:
3513495 3516751 "Here lies John Rambo, winner of<br />the Congressional Medal of Honor.
3517209 3520045 Survivor of countless<br />incursions behind enemy lines.
3521184 3523521 Killed for vagrancy,<br />in 'Jerkwater', USA.
3524360 3526196 Don't give me any of<br />that crap, Trautman!
3527097 3530233 You think Rambo was the only guy<br />who had a tough time in Vietnam?
3530233 3532890 He killed a police<br />officer, for Christ sake!
3532890 3534707 You're goddamned lucky<br />he didn't kill all of you...
3551309 3553626 This character! He<br />comes waltzing in here,
3553626 3555143 full of all kinds of good advice.
3555344 3558044 And wished we'd let that<br />goddamned maniac go on the loose,
3558044 3559245 so we could save our own asses!
3559245 3562496 Well, we saved our asses, Colonel!<br />And we didn't let him go on the loose.
3563036 3567131 The best man lost!<br />And he doesn't like it!
3656470 3659004 - How you doing, Will?<br />- Hold my calls.
3794044 3795044 Colonel?
3799445 3800363 Have a seat.
3806316 3808734 Oh miss, can you do this again, please?
3808734 3811152 - Oh sure!<br />- And for my friend...?
3811590 3814028 A shot of wild turkey.
3815666 3820301 If I was out of line before,<br />I just want to apologize.
3822378 3824475 None of that makes much<br />difference now, does it?
3826313 3827611 No, I guess not.
3829771 3831968 I suppose...
3832965 3834404 I just feel...
3836721 3840158 Like you were...cheated<br />out of your chance?
3840717 3842435 I wanted to kill that kid.
3843754 3846030 I wanted to kill him so<br />bad, I could taste it.
3847489 3849486 Doesn't sit well with that badge.
3850765 3853043 It can get confusing sometimes...
3855301 3857157 In Vietnam, you can bet that Rambo and
3857157 3861014 I got pretty confused. But we had orders.
3862093 3864410 When in doubt...kill!
3868485 3869982 But what the hell, you're a civilian.
3869982 3872631 You can go home to your wife,
3872631 3874180 and your house and<br />your little flower garden.
3874620 3876476 You're under no pressure<br />to figure all this out.
3876476 3877441 And what about you, Colonel?
3877441 3878891 What did you figure<br />out from all of this, huh?
3879892 3881992 I mean what would you have<br />done with him if he came in?
3882310 3884607 Would you wrap your arms<br />around him to give a big sloppy kiss?
3885085 3886943 Or would you have blown his brains out?
3895354 3898031 I couldn't answer that<br />until I met him face to face.
3901248 3902925 Well, there it is.
3904523 3907960 Just as well we never<br />got a chance to find out.
4014557 4015596 Drive!
4018153 4021928 Don't look at me, look at the road.<br />That's how accidents happen!
4022947 4025904 - What's your name?<br />- Cathcart, Robert A.
4026383 4028161 All right, what do you<br />got in the back, Robert A.?
4028662 4030140 M60.
4033349 4036249 - OK, Robert A., get out of the truck.<br />- I don't got no beef with you!
4037449 4038449 Go home! Move, go home!
4062503 4064861 Want to turn that up?
4068176 4070333 What's your story, Steamboat?
4070812 4073029 Looks like somebody<br />pulled the plug too soon...
4073230 4075847 That Rambo guy? He's on the loose again!
4075847 4076848 Shit!
4080063 4083159 Hey Will, it's Rambo! He's still around!
4295995 4299351 - Holy fuck!<br />- Get out there right away. Move!
4323562 4325361 What the hell is going on?!
4328358 4330834 - Watch yourselves!<br />- They're all going to blow!
4340585 4342780 Attention, all civilians!
4343620 4347556 For your own safety, please<br />evacuate the streets immediately.
4348615 4351930 Remain indoors until you<br />receive further instructions.
4351930 4354707 I repeat: this is a police emergency.
4354707 4357324 Please evacuate the streets immediately.
4375145 4377023 They found Rambo's body...
4377698 4380556 As a matter of fact,<br />he stole an army truck
4380556 4382915 and blew up a gas station<br />on the other side of town.
4383655 4385032 The kid is resilient.
4386212 4388566 Why don't you forget what you're<br />thinking and clear out while you can?
4389267 4391467 Get the fuck out of here, Trautman!<br />You take your advice with you.
4392525 4394161 When I talked to you<br />earlier this afternoon,
4394161 4396698 you knew he was still alive, didn't you?
4398038 4399456 I suspected it.
4399796 4404551 Sure...Sure, that's why you<br />stuck around. You trained him.
4404831 4407227 You taught him how to get<br />out of places like that cave.
4408106 4409945 But he's not going to<br />get out of this place!
4410384 4412741 Teasle, you and all your men<br />couldn't handle him before,
4412741 4414498 what makes you think<br />you can handle him now?
4415579 4417514 Because God knows what<br />damage he's prepared to do.
4429082 4430520 You're going to die, Teasle.
4431160 4432757 Everybody dies!
4433797 4436055 There's only one man in this<br />room that has half a chance.
4436055 4437913 That's not because<br />I am better than he is.
4438352 4439831 But it's because he trusts me.
4440270 4442206 See, I am the closest thing<br />to family that he has left,
4442206 4444543 and that may be all the edge I need.
4444984 4447181 Jesus Christ, where do<br />you people come from?
4452136 4454832 This is my job Trautman,<br />this is my town!
4455172 4458549 And I am not giving it up to you,<br />or to Rambo or anybody else!
4459089 4462285 Now you just stay the hell out of my way!
4471154 4473192 - Get a little closer!<br />- I can't!
4473192 4474589 lt's too goddamned hot!
4476429 4478203 Will, it's Lester, do you copy, over?
4480183 4483220 Come on, let's go! Will, this<br />is Lester, do you copy, over?
4484379 4489173 Listen Will, we have got some serious<br />problems. The highway's been cut off.
4489173 4492330 The truck's out here, but<br />we couldn't find the body.
4492769 4494306 I repeat: no body,<br />it's totally burnt out.
4494306 4496144 Preston, get those people out of here!
4497324 4499080 Move them back to the south side.
4500760 4505354 We don't know how many gas<br />tanks there are under the pumps...
4842606 4845444 Go ahead...go ahead!
4846164 4848102 Go ahead, you crazy<br />son of a bitch, finish me!
4848102 4849240 Rambo!
4850160 4851636 Rambo, don't do it!
4852555 4853813 Listen to me, Rambo!
4854153 4855112 You have no chance.
4856552 4857530 Drop your weapon.
4859029 4862343 We're going to order a chopper<br />in and fly you back to Bragg.
4864542 4865600 Hold your fire!
4870099 4870994 Hold your fire!
4871295 4872995 Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
4874051 4875487 Think about what you're doing.
4877408 4880564 The building's perimeter's<br />covered. No exits.
4881203 4883800 There's nearly 200 men<br />out there and a lot of M16s!
4884240 4886394 You did everything to make<br />this private war happen.
4887674 4889432 You have done enough damage!
4889833 4891990 This mission is over, Rambo.<br />Do you understand me?
4893429 4894527 This mission is over!
4897943 4899221 Look at them out there.
4902378 4903396 Look at them!
4906373 4908050 If you won't end this<br />happen, they will kill you!
4909490 4910870 Is that what you want?
4914165 4916861 lt's over, Johnny. lt's over!
4917201 4921676 Nothing is over! Nothing!<br />You just don't turn it off!
4922317 4925530 lt wasn't my war. You<br />asked me, I didn't ask you!
4926311 4929367 And I did what I had to do to win,<br />but someone wouldn't let us win.
4929907 4932284 And I come back to<br />the world, and I see all
4932284 4934862 those maggots at the<br />airport, protesting me, spitting.
4935402 4937716 Calling me baby killer<br />and all kinds of vile crap!
4939017 4941517 Who are they to protest<br />me, huh? Who are they?
4941517 4943191 Unless they have been me and been there,
4943191 4944791 and know what the<br />hell they're yelling about?
4944791 4948106 It was a bad time for everyone,<br />Rambo. It's all in the past now.
4948106 4950653 For you, For me,<br />civilian life is nothing.
4951354 4952959 In the field, we had a code of honor.
4953200 4956297 You watch my back, I watch<br />yours. Back here, there's nothing!
4956297 4960172 You're the last of an elite<br />group...don't end it like this.
4960172 4962689 Back there I could fly a<br />gunship, I could drive a tank,
4962689 4964666 I was in charge of a<br />million dollar equipment!
4964906 4967803 Back here, I can't even<br />hold a job parking cars!
4977453 4978470 Where is everybody?
4984444 4987000 I had a friend, who<br />was in the Air Force.
4988719 4992834 There were all these guys, man.<br />Back there were all these fucking guys!
4993274 4994833 Who were my friends!
4994833 4997947 Back here, there's nothing!<br />Remember Dan Forest?
4999466 5000304 Wore this black headband.
5000505 5002542 I took one of his magic<br />markers, and I said:
5002542 5004979 "If found, you mail this to Las Vegas",
5004979 5006677 because we were always<br />talking about Vegas,
5006677 5010218 and this fucking car. This so<br />great '58 Chevy convertible!
5010218 5011568 He was talking about his car,
5011568 5014469 he said we'd get cruised<br />till the tires fell off!
5022082 5024158 We were in this bar in<br />Saigon, and this kid comes up,
5024759 5026734 this kid carrying a shoe shine box.
5026734 5029412 And there, he says:<br />"Shine please, shine!"
5029951 5033028 I said no, and he kept asking,<br />yeah, and Joe would say 'yeah'.
5033467 5035244 And...I went to get a couple of beers.
5035945 5038822 And the box was wired.<br />He opened up the box...
5039260 5041038 Fucking blew his<br />body all over the place.
5042217 5043615 He's laying there and<br />he's fucking screaming,
5043615 5045114 there's pieces of him all over me!
5046453 5050268 And I am trying to pull them off, you<br />know...my friend! It's all over me!
5051047 5052305 I got blood and everything and...
5052305 5054763 I am trying to hold him<br />together, I put him together
5054763 5056681 the fucking entrails keep coming out!
5057121 5058879 And nobody would help!
5059359 5063232 He's saying, saying, "I want to<br />go home!" just calling my name.
5063672 5066270 "I want to go home, Johnny,<br />I want to drive my Chevy!"
5066270 5068428 I said: "Why I can't<br />find your fucking legs."
5069266 5070703 "I can't find your legs!"
5072383 5076818 I can't get it out of my<br />head. lt was seven years.
5077298 5078735 Every day it hurts.
5079215 5084848 Sometimes I wake up and don't know<br />where I am. I don't talk to anybody.
5085608 5087406 Sometimes a day.
5089123 5090842 Sometimes a week.
5092000 5094518 I can't put it out of my mind...
