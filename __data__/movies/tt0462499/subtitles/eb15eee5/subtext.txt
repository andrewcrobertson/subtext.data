5311 6681 ...something they had never seen,
6761 8051 which liberated a yellow,
8131 9864 very pungent and acrid vapor.
9984 11475 The actions of the hardline military regime
11596 14134 are the cause of increasing<br />international concern.
14416 15987 The regime crushes all dissent.
16109 17761 Ethnic groups are being oppressed
17881 18969 in the east of the country,
19251 20822 and foreign journalists are rarely...
20903 22313 ...claim tonight
22434 23763 that some form of chemical weapon
24086 25617 has been used in Burma<br />by military rulers...
25697 27510 ...has led to the national uprising.
27631 29122 Thousands took to the streets,
29243 31137 - and thousands were killed<br />- In Burma,
31217 32909 - by the Burmese military.<br />- protesting monks have been killed...
33030 35166 some burned alive,<br />and others drowned.
35287 37220 Foreign journalists<br />have been shot and killed.
37301 39154 ...as thousands of villages<br />have been destroyed,
39235 41007 rape and torture<br />are a daily occurrence.
41128 42740 In Burma, there are more landmines
42820 43989 - than anywhere in the world.<br />- Young men are beaten
44069 45480 and forced into the army,
45560 47454 many as young as 12 years old.
47534 49388 Beheadings and mutilations<br />are commonplace.
49509 50556 The Karen people,
50677 52007 comprised mostly<br />of poor Christian farmers,
52128 53698 have been singled out for extermination.
53980 55472 The ruling military government
55593 58211 wants the abundant national resources<br />on Karen land.
58332 60024 The bloody Burmese military campaign
60145 62764 against the Karen people has been<br />going on for almost 60 years...
62885 65262 the longest running civil war
65342 67075 in the world.
369153 370968 ...number one.
371088 372943 First snake that you see,
373023 374757 they are Siamese cobra.
374878 377499 Oh, come on, cobra.
377619 379031 He is not king cobra
379152 380643 and not spitting cobra.
397615 399752 Fuck off, okay?
404790 407774 ...still have fang<br />and still have poison.
409548 412047 He is small, dangerous...<br />Number one.
413216 415232 King cobra number two.
416521 417771 And now spitting cobra.
417852 420714 He can spit poison to your eye.
423294 426075 One color.
426156 428374 He is very, very dangerous.<br />Number one in Thailand.
428495 430954 Careful, my friend.
432929 435630 Looks like dangerous work.
436783 439644 I'm Michael Burnett.<br />Do you have some time to talk?
439765 441702 Won't take long.<br />I promise.
441783 443798 I was told it might be possible<br />to rent your boat.
443879 444968 We'd like to do that.
445048 446701 Is that possible?<br />We need to get upriver.
446782 448232 Where you going?
448312 450772 Into Burma.
450853 452224 Burma's a war zone.
452305 454562 Well, that's what people call it,
454683 457546 but it's more like genocide than war.
457868 459481 Anyway, this will be my fifth trip in,
459561 462424 so we are aware of all the risks.
465125 466979 I don't go that far north.
467100 469036 Let me explain our situation.
469158 471456 Our church is part of<br />a Pan-Asian ministry
471576 472907 located in Colorado.
473028 474520 We're all volunteers
474641 475971 who, around this time of year,
476293 478188 bring in medical supplies,
478308 479801 medical attention,
479881 481092 prayer books, and support
481212 483631 for the Karen tribespeople.
483711 485607 People say you know the river<br />better than anyone.
485687 488510 - Well, they lied.<br />- So what I'm asking is
488590 489800 that we compensate you
489881 492380 for a few hours of your time
492461 494315 that will help change people's lives.
497862 499072 Are you bringing in any weapons?
499194 500928 Of course not.
501008 502943 You're not changing anything.
504031 506813 Well...
506934 510040 it's thinking like that that keeps<br />the world the way it is.
509638 511209 Fuck the world.
513871 514959 - Let's go.<br />- Why?
515081 517218 He's not interested.<br />Let's just go.
517339 518468 - Let me try.<br />- No, Sarah...
518548 520202 Didn't you say it was<br />the only way up there?
520283 521775 - I know I did.<br />- Then what do we have to lose?
521895 523347 - I talked to the man...<br />- Just let me try, Michael.
523468 524436 - Sarah...<br />- Please.
524557 525525 You...
533449 534577 Hello?
535640 537495 I'm Sarah Miller.
537576 540842 I hope you don't mind me<br />coming back here.
540963 542374 The man that you<br />were talking to...
542454 543827 I wasn't talking to anybody.
546768 547939 All right, uh...
548060 549914 the man that was talking<br />to you asked
549995 552334 if we could hire you<br />to take us up the river.
552415 554391 You said no. Why?
554512 556285 Can't help you out.
557698 558988 Well, if you have good reasons,
559109 561206 would you mind if I heard them?
563988 566408 Go home.
715589 717487 Why'd you come back?
718978 719907 Waiting for you.
724585 726199 I told you before,<br />I can't help you.
726522 728337 Well, we need to go<br />and help these people.
728418 729911 We're here to make a difference.
729991 732533 We believe all lives are special.
732653 734872 - Some lives, some no.<br />- Really?
735154 736728 If everyone thought like you,<br />nothing would ever change.
736850 739026 - Nothing does change.<br />- Of course it does.
739148 740158 Nothing stays the same.
740278 742012 Live your life,<br />'cause you got a good one.
742133 743505 It's what I'm trying to do.
743626 745522 No, what you're trying<br />to do is change what is.
745805 747095 And what is?
748830 749798 Go home.
753026 754518 Really. Go home.
780052 781392 Maybe...
781743 784443 maybe you've lost<br />your faith in people,
785092 787956 but you must still<br />be faithful to something.
788077 790216 You must still care<br />about something.
791426 794976 Maybe we can't change what is...
795098 796752 but trying to save a life
796873 799000 isn't wasting your life.
799016 800025 Is it?
823305 824717 As bad as these people are,
824797 826130 they will eventually lose.
826210 828469 They can't keep it up<br />against a united front.
828590 830006 They can't.
830526 831576 I mean, time alone will tell,
831657 832909 but in the meantime,
833230 834327 we just have to help<br />hold it together.
834337 835652 I mean, just the other day...
836194 837125 Excuse me.
837126 839291 Sarah, where are you going?
840104 841181 To talk to him.
841836 843571 Well, he... He probably<br />wants his privacy.
843741 845196 Michael, we shouldn't ignore him.
845197 846973 - He's helping us.<br />- He's been paid.
847638 848973 He didn't take anything.
856311 858207 Thank you again for doing this.
858287 859255 Really.
859376 861113 From all of us.
861193 864057 You know you never<br />told us your name.
864139 865148 John.
866358 867973 Where you from?
868094 869911 Bowie, Arizona.
870031 871646 Why'd you leave?
871766 872815 I got drafted in 'Nam.
872935 874552 And you just stayed?
876527 877738 It's complicated.
878779 880314 You have family back home?
880435 882613 Father maybe. I don't know.
885115 886204 Aren't you curious to see
886325 888062 how things might have<br />changed back home?
890406 892261 Got to have a reason for that.
897028 898843 Sarah.
899086 900741 Because of you, we're going upriver.
902355 903766 Anytime you want to turn around,
903848 905017 it's done.
906855 907865 Okay.
958305 959758 What is it?<br />Who are they?
959839 961494 Burmese pirates.
961614 963391 Tell everyone to stay down,<br />don't make a sound.
965329 966902 - Who are they?<br />- It's all right.
967024 968315 - Just keep...<br />- Don't talk.
1005005 1007024 - Any more of them?<br />- Maybe.
1007145 1008680 What do you want to do?
1008801 1010577 We should keep going.<br />We made a commitment.
1010658 1012675 I ain't talking to you.
1012756 1014493 - What do you want to do?<br />- We're a group here.
1014614 1015662 If they wanna vote...
1017983 1019113 Sit down!
1019235 1020607 If it's money they want,<br />we'll give them what...
1023433 1025452 Nobody talks.<br />Heads down.
1034089 1036108 Keep your heads down,<br />and nobody look 'em in the eye,
1035980 1038160 or they'll kill you.
1142451 1143621 No!
1149961 1151658 What did you do?
1151779 1153878 We came here to help<br />stop the killing!
1154202 1155332 Who are you to...
1155454 1157109 - Who are you?<br />- Let him go!
1157191 1159000 They would have<br />raped her 50 times
1159457 1161188 and cut your fucking heads off.
1161817 1162943 Who are you?
1162996 1164120 Who are any of you?
1165342 1167282 We're going back!
1172435 1173404 No.
1173750 1175972 No, we shouldn't go back.
1176092 1177625 Let go.
1177748 1179525 What are you doing?
1179646 1181018 We are so close.
1181343 1184208 What happened here,<br />it's horrible.
1184290 1185825 But the people in there
1185906 1188047 are being killed like this every day.
1188128 1190914 Michael, this was your idea.
1191034 1193498 We made a commitment.
1193619 1196325 I know you don't believe<br />in what we're doing,
1196445 1199394 but it's our life, our choice.
1200604 1202866 You're not gonna change anything.
1205334 1207353 Please.
1207291 1209229 Please, John. Please.
1222972 1223981 Go sit down.
1232789 1233758 I'm sorry.
1280080 1281334 We'll be taking<br />the overland route
1281414 1282869 on the way back,
1282949 1284767 so there's no need<br />to wait around.
1284848 1287716 I have to report this.
1287796 1289857 I know you think<br />what you did was right,
1289272 1291131 but taking a life is never right.
1307951 1310295 I don't know what to say.
1310578 1313083 Then you shouldn't<br />say anything, should you?
1313160 1314897 Good luck.
1481796 1484464 Mm-hmm.<br />Good, good.
1487347 1488600 Open.
1492521 1493775 Yeah, good.
1501173 1503033 With power, through the spirit
1503154 1504529 in your inner being.
1508242 1510627 So Christ may dwell<br />in your hearts with faith.
1514954 1518878 And I pray...
1518958 1521385 you may have power together...
1523484 1526275 Let me see if I can fix<br />this little problem, okay?
1528175 1529267 Okay.
1540129 1541828 Hey, you.
1542027 1544210 Hand me one of those bandages?
1544332 1546597 Okay.
1546718 1547808 Thank you.
1548525 1549860 Okay.
1566168 1567745 - Get out of here!<br />- What about them?
1567865 1569039 Go on! Take them!
1587858 1588828 No!
1773491 1776446 Company leader calling Raven.<br />Come on, Raven.
1778025 1778956 What am I?
1779078 1780454 You made me this way.
1780535 1781911 A full-blooded combat soldier.
1781992 1783409 You just don't turn it off.
1783530 1784825 Talk to me, Johnny.
1784905 1786404 You just don't turn it off!
1786485 1788104 - It's over!<br />- Nothing is over!
1790572 1793124 When are you gonna<br />come full circle?
1793245 1794986 - I know the reasons you're here, John.<br />- No!
1795830 1796937 Aren't you curious to see
1797000 1798743 how things might have<br />changed back home?
1800250 1801301 You've done enough damage.
1802775 1804676 You're always gonna be<br />tearing away at yourself
1804686 1806684 until you come to terms<br />with what you are.
1807034 1808406 Until you come full circle.
1808719 1810000 So you're just gonna<br />stay here forever?
1810172 1812560 - John!<br />- I wanna go home!
1813322 1815508 John Rambo!
1815589 1817654 John?
1817635 1819174 John Rambo?
1831076 1832817 My name is Arthur Marsh...
1834031 1837310 pastor of the Christ Church<br />in Colorado.
1837432 1839253 I need to talk with you.
1839375 1843422 It's very important. I wouldn't<br />come here like this if it wasn't.
1846095 1848605 The morning of the day<br />the group left,
1848888 1851074 Michael Burnett notified me
1851196 1852856 that they were traveling<br />from this location.
1856537 1857469 What happened?
1857589 1859452 No one knows exactly.
1859532 1861518 They were supposed<br />to return 10 days ago,
1861639 1862813 but they never came back.
1863096 1866011 I requested help from the embassy,<br />but they can't help,
1866133 1869290 not in Burma, and not in time.
1869372 1870343 How do you know they're alive?
1870465 1871882 Because we've been in contact
1872003 1873462 with the Karen freedom fighters
1873786 1875163 who say they think they know
1875283 1876701 where they were taken.
1876781 1879212 And I was given the name<br />of an ex-military
1879292 1881155 American local from the embassy
1881235 1882895 who put me in touch with men
1882975 1884392 who say they have experience
1884474 1885648 in this part of the world.
1885770 1886945 Mercenaries.
1887066 1888524 Yes.
1890305 1892249 I don't have any other choice.
1892371 1894556 You know the exact spot.
1894636 1897012 We need you to take these men...
1897040 1898553 to where you let our people off.
1898839 1900741 When are they ready to leave?
1901426 1903491 When you are.
1919672 1922953 You know what you are?
1923075 1924978 What you're made of?
1927935 1929595 War is in your blood.
1931094 1932512 Don't fight it.
1934663 1936810 You didn't kill for your country.
1938471 1940780 You killed for yourself.
1943333 1945883 The gods are never<br />gonna make that go away.
1951363 1953064 When you're pushed...
1956670 1959183 killing's as easy as breathing.
1962722 1964178 My head was mangled
1964261 1966529 And my words were torn
1966650 1970296 Covered in blood<br />like a newly born
1971593 1974631 Hey, the wishing well
1974753 1977224 Singin' soft and low
1977345 1979127 I stayed for a while
1979208 1981234 In the hollow sound
1981355 1982693 The only water
1983016 1985245 Came up from the ground
1985327 1988243 - Look at this fucking place.<br />- Hey, the wishing well
1988324 1990025 Only a fucking ape would live here.
1990147 1991766 What the fuck am I doing here?
1991849 1994683 Hey, knock that shit off.
1994764 1997075 And you don't like the arts.
1997156 1998129 And you don't like shit.
1998249 1999788 I like your sister, Diaz.
1999910 2001530 She got a thing for retards.
2001651 2003557 Oi, boat man.
2003678 2006271 How much longer<br />in this ancient piece of shit?
2010556 2012580 So what'd the reverend<br />say to you?
2012703 2014771 Some shit about<br />padre's flock going missing.
2014891 2015946 I said to him, "Look, mate.
2016027 2016998 "That's what you get when you go
2017120 2018578 "trespassing into fucking Burma.
2018700 2020201 "That's what you'll get when you go
2020321 2021780 sniffing around other people's garbage. "
2021861 2022834 You know those generals in there
2022956 2024212 are making millions cranking out meth
2024293 2025548 more than any other place<br />on the fucking planet.
2025702 2027848 - Bullshit.<br />- Millions, moron.
2028130 2029713 How do you think<br />they pay for that shit?
2029835 2031253 You ought to try reading<br />the paper, redneck,
2031334 2032631 instead of sleeping under it.
2032753 2035385 Fucking generals,<br />biggest junkies of all of them.
2035507 2037451 - It's noble, Louis.<br />- You what?
2037573 2041180 Those people going in there<br />with no weapons,
2041302 2043749 just books and meds, it's noble.
2043894 2044934 Oi, School Boy!
2045434 2047017 You stick your noble nose<br />into other people's business,
2047117 2048133 you get fucked up
2048233 2049707 or you get dead.<br />The only reason
2049907 2051171 I'm doing this is for an ex-wife
2051271 2052995 and 3 kids, and after this shit is over,
2053109 2055264 you can shove that<br />soldiering right up your ass.
2055464 2056468 Try the decaf, mate.
2056565 2057593 Fuck off! And you,
2057648 2058806 I don't want to fucking die
2058906 2061017 of old age before<br />I get there, so move.
2066669 2067965 You say something?
2077044 2078542 Sing it to yourself
2078623 2080773 Sing it all night
2080853 2084542 Spent a lot of time<br />in the garbage can
2085110 2088757 Fighting over food<br />with the garbage man
2088879 2092000 Hey, the wishing well
2176290 2178723 I was digging a well
2178642 2180873 With an old blood stain
2181811 2185122 Poking around<br />with a blind man's...
2185209 2187278 Is it me,
2187400 2188576 or does the air this time of year
2188699 2190848 smell like a goddamn wet dog?
2193058 2195612 Fuck sake!<br />I could swim faster than this.
2195735 2196909 Am I right?
2196991 2198086 Heard that.
2198208 2200480 Come on.<br />Chop, chop!
2200600 2202913 The quicker we get there,<br />the quicker we get back.
2207937 2209883 Lousy God-squadders.
2210166 2212723 They come over here,
2212846 2215036 spouting all that shit...
2216255 2217512 and they expect the whole world
2217632 2218846 to work like<br />their fucking neighborhood.
2218930 2221487 Well, it doesn't...
2221607 2225054 so they send in the devil...
2225135 2226313 to do God's work.
2226395 2229233 It's ironic, isn't it?
2229315 2232237 Am I boring you, mate?
2233575 2235642 Or is it... is it the trip?
2235764 2237833 Has it got you nervous?
2237915 2239456 'Cause really you should<br />appreciate the action,
2239537 2240957 you know what I mean?
2241242 2243106 Got to be better than looking<br />at the ass end of a snake.
2246261 2247611 Oh, dear.
2248226 2250132 You really are<br />an uptight bastard, aren't you?
2253094 2254960 You can drop<br />the thousand-yard stare.
2255044 2257274 I've seen it all before,
2257396 2259223 and I'm not impressed.
2271353 2273017 He's old-school SAS.
2273140 2275127 They're first-rate soldiers,
2275208 2277724 but total egomaniacs.
2277806 2280159 They call me School Boy.
2281037 2283308 The name stuck with me<br />since sniper school.
2284285 2285536 And me mates won't<br />stop calling me it
2285636 2288154 no matter how many people I shoot.
2291301 2295000 It has illustrations<br />made by Tiny's hand
2314614 2316563 What do you want from us?
2362699 2364722 One man and a kid.<br />You gotta be fucking joking.
2364742 2367440 - This all the rebels they put up?<br />- I'm not liking it.
2367542 2369097 You're in a fucking jungle, puss nuts.
2369219 2370447 There's nothing to like.
2370642 2372046 How're you doing?
2372768 2373986 My name is Myint.
2374108 2375040 This is Tha.
2375162 2376991 - Is this it?<br />- Yes.
2377072 2379914 - What's up with the kid, man?<br />- He good tracker.
2379996 2382390 We don't need a tracker,<br />we need a fucking guide.
2382512 2383980 You know the exact<br />location, right?
2384000 2385963 10 kilometers west,
2386084 2387914 2 north, 6 to a walk.
2388035 2390308 - How many soldiers?<br />- Hundred maybe.
2390390 2391607 - Hundred?<br />- What'd he say?
2391689 2393489 More new soldiers come tomorrow.
2393678 2396111 Hey, I know I'm just<br />a white trash grunt, but I can count.
2396243 2397593 Fuck fucking with a hundred strong.
2397600 2398600 All right, all right,<br />all right, all right,
2398669 2399846 let's get this straight.
2400242 2401663 We don't engage anybody.
2401743 2403979 If we can extract these people, good.
2404100 2406497 But it's in-out clean, or we fuck off.
2406618 2408327 Somebody wanna tell me<br />what the boat man's doing?
2410314 2412102 Hey, why aren't you waiting<br />with the boat?
2412223 2414338 My men are staying<br />with the boat.
2414419 2416286 You're the boat man.<br />You stay with the boat.
2416366 2418275 - I won't slow you down.<br />- Yeah, I know you won't.
2418562 2420670 - It's not a fucking nature hike.<br />- Believe that.
2420751 2422988 - He can hang with me at the back.<br />- Hey, hey, he stays here.
2423109 2425629 He's the boat man.<br />He stays with the fucking boat.
2425751 2428959 I want a white man on it,<br />not some fucking dink.
2429041 2430421 Now who's got explosives? Tombstone?
2430544 2433712 - None.<br />- A pound of C4 and primer.
2433833 2434766 I got a claymore.
2434889 2438423 All right, let's get on with it.
2438544 2439684 Come on!<br />Move, move!
2476644 2477859 What the fuck is that?
2477983 2479813 Called Tallboy Bomb.

2529628 2532514 Your people taken from here.
2534263 2535808 Man, I have seen some shit.

2569369 2571527 Watch where you walking.
2585319 2587355 - All right, let's move on.<br />- To what?
2587476 2589143 They even killed the fucking dogs.
2589264 2590282 Those people are dead.
2590404 2591382 I'm with En-Joo.

2607246 2610012 If anything's wrong, anything at all,
2610135 2611721 we leave.
2611801 2613550 All right?
2614690 2615626 Yeah.
2617091 2618066 All right.
2618147 2619653 Good.
2619774 2620711 Which way?
2620833 2622296 This way.
2625552 2626986 Army! Go! Go!
2649665 2650966 I'm going to fire on them.
2651087 2652513 - No!<br />- If they don't make it back
2652797 2653938 from wherever<br />the hell they came from,
2654060 2655199 man, they are on to us.
2671871 2673621 What the fuck<br />are they doing, man?
2761150 2762127 Who are you, boat man?
2762247 2763553 Let's move.
2763676 2765429 Move? They're going to come<br />hunting our asses down
2765550 2766935 when these guys don't show up.
2767017 2768930 We don't need this shit.<br />We're going back to the boat.
2769012 2769995 Let's go.
2770115 2771620 - Whoa!<br />- Hey, hey!
2776921 2780058 Any of you boys want to shoot,
2780181 2781322 now's the time.
2787149 2788575 And there isn't one of us
2788698 2791876 that doesn't want<br />to be someplace else.
2791957 2796195 But this is what we do, who we are.
2798480 2800143 Live for nothing
2800941 2803144 or die for something.
2807329 2808329 Your call.
2810758 2811939 What's your call?
2812506 2813689 Let's move.
2856171 2858864 Once School Boy's on the tower,<br />we got 15 minutes.
2858944 2860699 Set your watches to 1:45.
2860819 2862862 In, out, no waiting around<br />for nobody.
2862986 2864491 We meet at the base<br />of the tower.
2864614 2865926 You don't make it<br />up there, we're fucked.
2866045 2868533 He will, inbred. All set?
2868655 2870124 - Yeah.<br />- Set.

3057185 3058124 She's over there.
3058219 3059159 You untie him.
3059281 3060467 We'll be back for you.
3084726 3085992 You.
3088719 3090601 There's two of them<br />in the cage near the pigs.

3356318 3358084 - And Sarah.<br />- 15 minutes. That's the deal.
3358168 3359197 - We're leaving.<br />- Let's go!
3359320 3360762 - Five more minutes.<br />- Bullshit!
3360846 3362080 He knew the deal.
3362161 3363480 We came together,<br />we fucking leave together!
3363603 3364713 Your life. Let's go.
3364796 3366034 Not without her!
3369489 3371507 God didn't save your life.<br />We did.
3371632 3372951 Now fucking get up.
3373358 3374789 Get up. Move!
3375412 3376855 This way.
3534026 3535223 - Got a compass?<br />- Yeah.
3535348 3537003 Why did you come back?
3537087 3538783 Why did you?
3540677 3541671 Hang on till daylight.
3541791 3542868 This way.
3636730 3639142 My leg! My leg!<br />Jesus! God damn it!
3650404 3652357 Shut up. Shut up.<br />We got you. We're getting out.
3654392 3656058 - His leg is shredded!<br />- Shit.
3656184 3658222 Where's the guide?
3658347 3660053 The son of a bitch is gone!
3660136 3661262 Fuck him. I know the coordinates.
3661384 3662512 We're not making it<br />to the river with him.
3662594 3663924 Would you shut the fuck up?
3664049 3665088 Tie his leg. Take off his boot.
3665212 3666587 No!
3666715 3668210 Leave his boot on.
3668574 3670534 Let us in here.<br />We're doctors. I need a knife.
3670658 3672033 Here, here, here.
3674077 3675619 Oh, fuck! Fuck!
3675741 3677950 - He going to make it?<br />- I don't know. Make a stretcher.
3678036 3679326 Spread out!
3703935 3704899 Take the point!
3713321 3714448 Take it! Take it!
3722743 3724204 Hear that?
3725019 3726104 They're tracking us.
3729945 3731451 - Turn around.<br />- What are you doing?
3731573 3733916 Just move. Turn, turn.
3733997 3735921 All right.
3736005 3738846 I want you two to head<br />southeast to the river.
3738932 3740267 And the boat will be waiting.
3740349 3742527 If it's not there,<br />you can follow the shoreline
3742651 3743946 until I find you.
3744029 3745947 What about you?
3746033 3748042 I'll be all right.<br />Give me that claymore.
3749657 3751109 - Now fire off a shot.<br />- What?
