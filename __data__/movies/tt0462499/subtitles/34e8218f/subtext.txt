18132 19205 Let's keep those hammers working.
39000 40575 Rambo!
43379 44209 Let's go.
65238 66813 How are you, Johnny?
68104 69101 Good.
70813 71685 That's all.
75113 78062 John, I'm sorry they sent<br />you to such a hellhole.
78744 80233 I've seen worse.
80290 81595 Yeah, you have, haven't you...
83077 85464 John, I told you that<br />I'd help you when I could.
86268 87717 Are you interested?
90763 94391 You can't possibly wanna<br />stay here for another five years.
101315 103639 In here at least, I know where I stand.
103546 105870 Just hear me out first.
107368 109858 A covert operation is being<br />geared up in the Far East.
109794 111618 Your name was dug<br />out of computer as one of
111545 113577 three most able to complete the mission.
115908 116683 Mission?
116652 118781 Recon for POWs in Nam.
123774 125556 Why now? Why me?
127835 130429 The prison camp you escaped<br />from in '71 is the target area.
130902 132893 Nobody knows that<br />terrain better than you do.
133514 135191 The risk factor is very high.
135240 137380 You'd be temporarily<br />reinstated in the Forces,
137294 139015 and if the mission's successful,
138984 141119 there may be a presidential pardon.
143385 144356 You interested?
151827 152758 Yeah.
153260 157598 Good... good. I'll get<br />the necessary clearance.
158575 160150 The next time we meet,<br />it will be in Thailand
160088 162706 with the Special Ops designate<br />who runs the operation.
162838 163959 Yes, Sir.
164751 166098 - All clear?<br />- Yes.
166221 169648 John, I want you to know that I did<br />what I could to keep you outta here.
169885 170776 I know.
172341 173175 Yeah.
173299 174183 Sir?
175549 177530 Do we get to win this time?
179165 181138 This time, it's up to you...
309913 311260 That'll be all.
312920 314807 How you doin', Rambo? I'm Ericson.
315131 317224 Why don't we make it over to the hangar?
319809 322217 You're the chosen one, huh?
322597 325187 You made a helluva rep'<br />for yourself in Nam!
326260 328750 Anyway, I'm glad to be workin' with you.
329047 332382 This place may not be heaven,<br />but at least you're out of the joint!
337608 338708 He's here.
342168 343642 - Morning, John.<br />- Sir.
344159 347378 This is Marshal Murdock. He's in charge<br />of Special Operations from Washington.
347324 348150 Thank you, Colonel.
348395 350267 Rambo, been looking<br />forward to meeting you.
350193 351752 How was your trip? No problems?
351689 352516 No.
352720 354256 Except for the damned heat, right?
354194 355729 Never felt anything like it!
356105 357927 Come on in, let's get down to business!
360007 363534 I was glancing over your files.
363870 366129 Makes some pretty interesting reading!
371516 374464 Rambo, John J., born 7.6.47,
374446 376663 Bowie, Arizona, of<br />Indian-German descent.
376971 378568 That's a helluva combination!
378904 380707 Joined the army 8.6.64,
380873 383785 accepted special forces,<br />specialization: light weapons.
384456 386787 Cross-trained as medic.<br />Helicopter and language qualified.
386766 390705 59 confirmed kills, 2 silver<br />stars, 4 bronze, 4 Purple Hearts,
390564 393206 distinguished service<br />cross, and Medal of Honor.
394233 395678 You got around, didn't ya?
395920 397171 Incredible!
398521 401843 Rambo, you're probably aware<br />that there's almost 2.500 Americans
401759 403878 still Missing In Action<br />in South-East Asia.
403968 405563 Most of these boys are presumed killed,
405500 408345 but to the legal families,<br />Congress and lots of Americans,
408427 410439 it's still a very emotional issue.
411836 413164 Gimme something cold, please!
414104 416909 Rambo, you certainly don't know<br />as much about me as I do you.
417224 421574 I've honched with the 2nd Battalion,<br />3rd Marines, in Kon Tum in '66.
421649 425510 I lost a lot of good men, so I know<br />what you and every vet feels now.
425373 426696 Maybe the government didn't care,
426643 429634 maybe certain segments of<br />the population didn't care,
430468 431687 but my committee cares.
431739 432817 So what his committee needs is
432774 435103 exclusive proof that<br />Americans are being held.
435046 436917 Once done, rest sure we'll get 'em back.
437239 439936 Now, if there's any of our<br />men at this POW target camp,
439827 442420 you'll confirm their presence<br />by taking photographs.
443689 444640 Photographs?
444602 445494 Just photographs.
445459 448749 Under no circumstances are<br />you to engage the enemy.
450425 451958 I'm supposed to leave 'em there?
451973 455212 I repeat: do not engage the enemy.
455519 457658 Phase 2, Delta Force assault<br />team led by Colonel Trautman
457572 458771 will handle the extraction.
460123 461166 Okay?
465513 467858 Anyway, I'd just like to say that<br />I feel with your participation,
467764 470421 this mission has a<br />better than average chance
470351 472199 to succeed where others have failed.
473116 475651 I'll meet you both in the<br />operations center in one hour.
493905 497142 From Thailand, across Laos, into the<br />mountains of Vietnam, to the drop zone.
497449 500166 You'll be flying a ceiling of<br />250 feet when you bail out.
500874 502444 - Think you can handle it?<br />- I'll try.
503520 504406 Since you're going in solo,
504371 507447 you'll have to rely on more<br />equipment than you ever used before.
508019 508865 And use it!
509232 511734 What I'm sayin' is don't try<br />the blood-and-guts routine.
512622 514152 Let technology do most of the work.
514928 516667 John, I want you to<br />try to forget the war.
516597 518128 Remember the mission.
518368 519827 The old Vietnam's dead.
520144 523168 Sir, I'm alive, it's<br />still alive, ain't it?
534201 537689 You may find this hard to<br />believe, but all this is for you!
537685 539138 Impressed?
539580 541040 Besides modern computer<br />devices you can see here,
541017 543046 you'll be issued every<br />other modern piece
542964 545305 of equipment we have<br />to ensure your safety.
545548 547770 Rambo, you can feel totally<br />safe because we have the
547681 550423 most advanced weapons in<br />the world available to us.
551941 554224 I've always believed that<br />the mind's the best weapon.
554432 555673 Times change.
556340 557649 For some people.
559049 560252 Don't let me interrupt you, Colonel.
560720 563087 Upon insertion, call in<br />to base camp on Transat.
563468 566770 Then proceed to Point Hawk September<br />to rendezvous with the ground contact:
567138 568354 indigenous agent Co Bao.
568905 570156 Is he listening?
571732 573428 Indigenous agent Co Bao.
581047 582375 Colonel!
583676 585856 Are you sure he's still not<br />unbalanced from the war?
585906 588062 We can't afford to have him<br />involved in this mission,
587975 589610 he might crack under<br />the pressure in that hell!
589945 590988 Pressure?
591721 594482 Let me just say that Rambo is the<br />best combat vet I've ever seen.
594648 598641 A pure fighting machine with only a<br />desire to win a war that someone else lost.
599047 604194 If winning means he has to<br />die, he'll die. No fear, no regrets.
604337 606768 And... one more thing:
607409 611727 What you choose to call<br />"Hell", he calls home!
615136 617378 Stand by!<br />Start A.P.U.!
640342 642044 D minus 20.
672915 674285 D minus 5.
689360 691808 You got 36 hours to<br />get the hell in and out.
692010 693518 So don't stop to smell the roses, okay?
693659 694493 Yeah.
695373 696857 If you run into any<br />trouble, try to get to the
696798 699323 hilltop extraction site<br />marked on your map.
699221 700625 Ready to roll, Colonel.
706241 708319 - Good luck, son.<br />- Thanks.
708313 709536 Let's go!
712395 714073 Remember Murdock said he'd<br />been with the 2nd Battalion,
714007 716727 third Marines in Kon Tum in '66?
717018 717956 Yeah.
717951 720296 The 2nd Battalion was at Kud Sank.
722033 723900 You're the only one I trust.
764803 767870 - Think he'll find someone?<br />- POWs? Doubtful.
768123 769884 But there's people to satisfy,
769814 771782 questions that have to be answered.
773381 775249 You don't sound too<br />emotional about it...
775174 776834 It wasn't my war, Colonel.
777205 779382 I'm just here to clean up the mess!
821326 822819 AWACS two-five has acquired.
823076 824820 They're holding timeline.
825467 827061 Affirmative, Wolf Den. Over.
860787 862780 Back in the badlands, my man!
863774 865476 Stand by your position!
866384 868413 - Insertion in 15 seconds.<br />- Partytime!
881273 882269 Five seconds!
882529 883364 Four...
883431 884265 Three...
884232 885275 Two...
885234 886381 Jumper away.
899887 900930 Shit, what's happening?
900989 902666 A turbulence! He's hung up!
904766 906133 He'll be torn apart!
907479 909043 Condition Red! He's hung up!
909430 911007 - What do you mean he's hung up?<br />- What's happening?
911043 912410 He's being dragged!
914557 915599 Lifer cut him loose!
915562 916991 I can't free him!
937341 938905 Ericson, abort the mission! Pull out.
939079 940816 That'll kill him! He'll be torn apart!
944152 945851 He's cutting away his equipment.
956712 957664 He's out!
958904 961104 Come in here, this is Dragonfly<br />one. Do you read me, over?
961315 963306 Dragonfly one, come in, I read you.
963563 967446 - Any visual bearing by flares?<br />- Negative. We didn't see anything.
974434 976232 Maybe the smartest thing<br />to do is to abort the mission
976160 978376 right now before there's<br />any more complications.
978487 980260 I mean who could've<br />survived something like that?
980384 981962 He deserves the benefit of the doubt.
982337 984515 He's got 36 hours to<br />complete the mission,
984527 986496 and reach the extraction point.
987154 989329 - We owe him that.<br />- Of course, we do!
990858 994462 But understand something<br />now: in 36 hours, we pull out!
1095805 1096655 Rambo!
1110398 1112557 You did not expect a woman, no?
1115239 1116858 We'd better go.
1119499 1122690 We go to river. How come you so late?
1123898 1125435 Got hung up.
1131246 1134563 I have arranged boat to take<br />us down river. Old ways not safe.
1135705 1138648 You come a long way,<br />Rambo, to see empty camp.
1190299 1191752 You're using pirates?
1192210 1195230 Best way down river.<br />Not get army suspicious.
1273844 1275395 What about patrol boats?
1296380 1297751 Russian.
1324094 1325112 Rambo!
1325605 1326970 Want to eat?
1328790 1330281 Maybe later.
1339223 1340883 How you get into this?
1343087 1345612 - It's a long story.<br />- Long ride.
1349338 1352826 Well... after I left the<br />Special Forces, I...
1352961 1357236 ...moved around a lot.<br />- Why you leave army?
1357500 1359122 I...
1360288 1362612 ...came back to the States,
1362997 1365279 and found another war going on.
1366860 1368976 What war?
1369767 1371593 Kind of like a quiet war.
1373550 1377956 A war against... all<br />the soldiers returning.
1377878 1379365 It's the kind of war you don't win.
1383358 1384408 It's...
1385166 1386626 It's my problem.
1386968 1388845 How about you? How did you get into it?
1389517 1392502 My father worked for intelligence agency.
1394456 1396336 He killed, and I take his place.
1398438 1399891 There's too much death here.
1400787 1401990 Death everywhere.
1405604 1407098 I just want to live, Rambo.
1410701 1413850 Maybe go America! Live the quiet life.
1418468 1420003 What you want?
1422450 1424938 To win... to survive...
1426949 1430290 Not so easy to survive. Still war here.
1430932 1434626 To survive a war, you gotta become war.
1434793 1438926 That why they pick you?<br />Because you like to fight?
1440560 1441811 Nah...
1443117 1444608 I am expendable.
1445349 1446391 Expendable?
1447577 1449362 What mean "expendable"?
1451519 1452556 It's like...
1453031 1458508 ...someone invites you to<br />a party and you don't show up,
1459124 1460595 it doesn't really matter.
1467726 1469177 What's this?
1470314 1471783 It bring me good luck.
1474017 1475779 What bring you good luck?
1483535 1484859 I guess this.
1491297 1492997 No further report.
1493130 1494621 I want to go up with the<br />extraction team at dawn.
1495399 1496976 - Denied.<br />- Denied?
1497350 1500047 - It's an unnecessary risk.<br />- We have a schedule to keep.
1500376 1502226 For Who?! We don't even<br />know if Rambo's alive!
1502152 1503375 The odds are against it.
1503524 1505890 You said we'd go through as planned.
1507387 1511205 Okay, if you want to go<br />through with it, we will.
1511488 1513770 The Colonel's gonna be<br />joining the extraction team.
1516705 1518531 You're a damned good man, Trautman!
1573607 1576015 See? Camp empty.
1576992 1578984 We move closer.
1621632 1623037 Cyclo-girl whore from village.
1628321 1629442 Come on!
1645047 1647513 - What is it?<br />- A bow. No sound.
1654323 1655334 You not going in there.
1655593 1658271 But I thought you're<br />supposed only to take pictures!
1659101 1660305 What about orders?
1661252 1662662 No more orders, Co.
1877318 1878770 I've come to get you out.
1880303 1881963 Don't talk.
1909212 1911532 - There are others.<br />- I'll be back.
2008646 2009559 Fine?
2010278 2011814 Let's go!
2043167 2044639 You have clearance.
2045277 2046832 Minus one hour to extraction.
2047746 2050776 I hope for his sake we're<br />not just wasting fuel...
2051132 2052498 Let's get moving!
2074627 2075597 A good thing you came when you did.
2076635 2077505 Why is that?
2078647 2081015 They move us around a<br />lot, to harvest crops.
2081020 2082344 Only been there a week.
2082968 2084456 When was the last time<br />you were in that camp?
2084396 2085884 A year... yeah.
2086625 2088189 What year is it, anyway?
2088741 2089693 1985.
2093998 2095446 Camp supposed to be empty.
2096986 2098333 Yeah, supposed to be...
2098279 2099217 Come on!
2130275 2132323 L.Z. two klicks up river.
2191756 2194330 - What has happened?<br />- We've been sold out.
2195898 2197019 You bastard!
2231337 2232594 All right, jump!
2233345 2234283 I fight!
2234721 2236259 Jump! Go on!
2289635 2291129 The gunboat!
2308431 2309302 Jump!
2321252 2323120 You made it, Rambo!
2331009 2332171 C'mon!
2355857 2358388 You take this. We go on from here.
2359479 2362135 - It better I stay to end.<br />- This is the end.
2363661 2364658 Go on, let's go!
2365851 2366888 Rambo!
2368280 2370314 You not expendable.
2392730 2394887 Colonel, 3 minutes.
2464407 2465735 That's Rambo!
2472012 2473424 Christ, he's found one!
2502234 2504810 Relay the command.<br />Rambo's found one of ours!
2505381 2507100 Mr. Murdock, Dragonfly<br />reports that ground crew
2507031 2510000 has what appears to be an<br />American POW with them.
2510874 2514195 - What did you say?<br />- They've got one of ours!
2514161 2514995 Hey! Yeah! Yeah!
2515097 2518086 This station is now on Condition Bravo.<br />Harrison, Meyers, Goodell, out!
2518042 2519091 Everybody out!
2520050 2521093 Come on, move!
2521427 2523710 Go to your COMINT priority<br />frequency! Gimme the mike!
2526325 2527920 Dragonfly, this is Coach 1.
2527956 2530177 This is an Alpha-Kilo-Victor<br />command priority.
2531980 2533225 Come on!
2536559 2538377 I want you to abort the<br />mission immediately!
2538341 2540918 I say again, this is a<br />recall. Confirm. Over.
2540916 2543597 Say it again, coach 1, say it again.
2543886 2545504 I'm tellin' you to abort!
2545540 2546582 Colonel!
2546713 2548704 I've been ordered to<br />abort before pick-up!
2548625 2551034 Murdock, Murdock, for Christ<br />sake, we've got 'em in sight!
2551013 2552277 Murdock, do you read?
2555028 2556071 Come on!
2556389 2558523 - We're going down!<br />- You're not going anywhere.
2562402 2564394 You goddamned mercenaries!
2564314 2566306 There's men down there! OUR men!
2567180 2569500 No, your men. Don't be a hero.
2577136 2578215 Colonel!
2578689 2580141 Don't leave!
2619504 2622736 What are you doing? Do you<br />know what the hell you've done?
2622968 2624532 Don't act so innocent, Colonel!
2624755 2627101 You had your suspicions,<br />and if you suspected then,
2627006 2628725 you're sort of an accessory, aren't you?
2628881 2630758 Don't ever count me<br />with you and your scum!
2631868 2633328 It was a lie, wasn't it?
2633470 2636075 Just like the whole<br />damn war. It was a lie!
2636168 2637627 What are you talkin' about?
2637919 2640630 That camp was supposed to be empty.
2641603 2643689 Rambo goes in, a decorated Vet,
2643605 2646523 he finds no POWs, the<br />Congress buys it, case closed.
2646461 2649068 And if he happens to get caught,<br />no one knows he's alive except
2648963 2652090 you and your computers, and you<br />can reprogram that, can't you?
2652096 2654598 Who the hell do you think<br />you're talkin' to, Trautman?
2654983 2657589 A stinking bureaucrat<br />who's tryin' to cover his ass.
2657484 2661237 No, not just mine, Trautman!<br />We're talkin' about the nation's!
2661154 2664073 Besides, it was your hero's fault.<br />Now if your warrior had gone in,
2663956 2666041 and done what the hell<br />he was supposed to do,
2666033 2668014 we'd be out of this clean and simple!
2668734 2670714 He was just supposed to take pictures.
2670731 2672504 And if those pictures showed something,
2672433 2674726 they would have been...<br />lost, wouldn't they?
2675330 2678406 Oh, Trautman, I still don't think<br />you understand what this is all about.
2678299 2680071 The same as it always is: money.
2681045 2684381 In '72, we were supposed to pay the<br />Cong 4.5 billion in war reparations.
2684408 2687015 We reneged, they kept the POWs.
2687317 2689924 And you're doing the<br />same thing all over again.
2690461 2692025 What the hell would you do, Trautman?
2692294 2694431 Pay blackmail money<br />to ransom our own men,
2694345 2697107 and finance the war<br />effort against our allies?
2697293 2700160 What if some burnt-out POW<br />shows up on the 6 o'clock news?
2700179 2701065 What you wanna do?
2701129 2703370 Start the war all over again,<br />you wanna bomb Hanoi,
2703313 2705659 wanna everybody screaming<br />for armed invasion?
2705665 2708427 You think civilians are gonna get up on<br />the floor of the United States Senate,
2708345 2711733 and ask for billions of dollars<br />for a couple of forgotten ghosts?
2711627 2714650 Men, goddamn it! Men who<br />fought for their country!
2714530 2715884 That's enough!
2716564 2717607 Trautman...
2718366 2721077 I'm gonna forget this<br />conversation ever took place.
2722997 2724143 You bastard!
2724698 2725741 And if I were you,
2725863 2728730 I'd never make the mistake of<br />bringing this subject up again!
2729015 2730734 You're the one who's making the mistake.
2730742 2732097 Yeah? What mistake?
2733448 2734699 Rambo.
2792084 2793844 Damned Russian bastards!
2818487 2820000 He's dead now.
2830054 2831610 Bring him up!
2850143 2851471 The knife!
2851894 2854924 These people are so<br />vulgar in their methods.
2855797 2857496 They lack compassion.
2860616 2862809 I'm Lieutenant-Colonel Podovski.
2865873 2868238 I do not know who you are yet,
2868621 2870030 but I will!
2870771 2872348 Take him and clean him up.
2905592 2907046 That's all.
2907426 2910305 Thank you, Captain Vinh.<br />Leave one guard, please.
2915628 2917552 I see you are no stranger to pain.
2919212 2922322 Perhaps you have been among<br />my Vietnamese comrades before?
2925464 2926709 No answer?
2927773 2929659 Do you wish to give your name?
2930561 2932859 What possible harm can that cause?
2936613 2939352 Pride is a poor<br />substitute for intelligence.
2940078 2943481 What you must understand is<br />that we have to interrogate you.
2945892 2947070 To Sergeant Yushin here,
2947023 2949765 you're piece of meat,<br />a laboratory experiment.
2949752 2953906 But to me, you are a<br />comrade, similar to myself,
2953916 2957173 just opposed by an act of fate.
2958513 2962924 I know you were trying to facilitate<br />the release of war criminals held
2962813 2965554 by this Republic. I can appreciate this.
2966280 2970304 But this incident, your capture, is...
2972053 2973299 ...embarrassing.
2973844 2975713 We must have explanation.
2976775 2979283 First of all, I wish you to<br />radio your headquarters,
2979182 2984192 and say that you have been captured<br />and condemned for espionage activities,
2984566 2989055 and that no such criminal aggression<br />should be attempted in the future!
2989097 2993223 Or they will meet with<br />the same fate as yours.
3002416 3003764 Fuck you!
3006619 3010918 You wish to test your<br />strength... Good. Good!
3014124 3015387 Yushin!
3073156 3078758 Comrade, here is something<br />that might be of interest to you:
3078810 3082659 a transcript of the conversation<br />between your helicopter pilot
3082873 3086192 and his commander we intercepted.
3087452 3091810 "Dragonfly"... "Wolf's<br />Den"... colorful names!
3092508 3093901 Here we are:
3093882 3096159 "We have them in sight".
3096368 3101042 And the reply: "Abort the<br />operation immediately."
3102106 3106506 "This is a recall. Confirm. Over."
3107441 3110588 It seems you were<br />abandoned by direct command.
3111880 3115325 And these are the people<br />you protect... with your pain!
3120047 3123613 You may scream. There is no shame.
3152955 3155653 You are strong... Very strong!
3155982 3158120 The strongest so far.
3158490 3161894 But you're nearly dead! Poor waif.
3162312 3164028 Make the radio call.
3189152 3192390 To talk, to obey would<br />be so much easier.
3205793 3209239 Yushin has a memento<br />for you of this occasion!
3230985 3232766 Put it in his eye.
3239506 3244032 If your own life means nothing<br />to you, then perhaps his does.
3244326 3247977 - Don't tell them anything!<br />- You will talk.
3257427 3258379 Yes?
3292226 3293887 Don't do it!
3296110 3297522 Do it!
3297902 3299146 Now!
3327271 3330301 Two-two-o-five-six...
3331514 3333234 Lone Wolf, receive.
3334677 3337167 This is Lone Wolf, two-two-o-five-six
3337903 3339978 Lone Wolf, this is Wolf's Den.
3339895 3341865 Transmit location and status. Over.
3341986 3343028 What is it?
3343402 3344826 It's Rambo, Sir.
3346345 3348853 We read you, Lone Wolf.<br />What is your position? Over.
3350805 3353669 I say again: What is<br />your position? Over.
3354785 3358771 Your friend dies if you do not answer.
3360141 3361904 Johnny, this is Trautman.<br />Where the hell are you?
3366690 3368185 John, come in!
3376747 3377701 Murdock?
3379096 3380632 He's here.
3384791 3387238 Rambo, this is Murdock,<br />we're glad you're alive!
3387855 3388888 Where are you?
3389948 3392126 Give us your position, and<br />we'll come to pick you up.
3400559 3401596 Murdock...
3404859 3406311 I'm comin' to get you!
3543374 3544827 Duck!
3607286 3608697 This way.
3645196 3646978 We safe for now.
3651045 3655404 - You look like hell, Rambo.<br />- Tough night.
3656263 3658421 Maybe need this.
3660723 3663794 - You hurt bad.<br />- It's alright.
3670519 3671681 Listen...
3672509 3675581 What you did back there...
3675974 3678256 ...I won't forget it.
3679756 3680795 Thanks.
3683881 3684959 What you do now?
3685492 3687170 Try to get across to Thailand?
3687880 3688832 Yeah.
3689195 3690550 Then go America?
3690795 3691747 Yeah.
3697518 3699071 You take me with you?
3710260 3711754 You take me?
3714363 3715317 Yeah.
3717946 3719813 I think you make good choice.
3720538 3721476 Yeah.
3722645 3724534 - We go?<br />- Let's go.
3760155 3761774 You alright?
3775249 3777946 Rambo... You... not... forget... me.
3778315 3779352 No.
3780310 3781249 No.
3781412 3782351 No.
3796969 3799023 I want the rescue team<br />ready to go in one hour.
3798940 3800087 You're risking your career,
3800042 3801917 your reputation, and even<br />your family's security!
3801938 3804619 Do you honestly think any<br />one man's worth all that?
3804512 3805346 Yes, I do.
3805549 3807895 I'm getting you a direct order<br />to withdraw from this project.
3807800 3809937 Do I get the rescue team<br />or do I go over your head?
3809927 3811773 You don't seem to understand something:
3811799 3814999 I'm in charge here. You're just a tool.
3815924 3817330 We're the machine.
3818451 3821087 I want him placed under arrest.<br />He's not to leave the base.
3825520 3826530 He never had a chance, did he?
3827190 3829347 Like you said, Colonel: he went home.
4642805 4643848 Yeah! Over here!
4650316 4651358 Get back!
4655891 4657977 C'mon! Go to the chopper! Move, move!
4659839 4662002 Go to the chopper!<br />Go to the chopper!
4663383 4664217 Move!
4664886 4665928 Go to the chopper!
4666689 4667731 That's it!
4667890 4668932 Move, move, move!
4670894 4671937 Hold on!
4678030 4679490 C'mon! Move it, move it!
4683637 4684993 Move, move, move, move!
4693551 4695011 A man at the gun!
4708297 4709548 Yeah, Yeah!
4711000 4712251 You guys made it!
4748549 4749800 Chopper on our tail!
4752515 4753453 Hang on!
4839442 4840380 Hold on!
4846686 4848250 Fire in the tail!
4967622 4969498 Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.
4971047 4972923 Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.
4974768 4977479 Wolf's Den, this is<br />Lone wolf, do you read?
4978439 4980211 Wolf's den, this is Lone Wolf, over.
4980440 4982003 Yes, we hear you, Lone Wolf. Over.
4982814 4984795 Prepare for emergency landing.
4985216 4987301 Arriving with American POWs.
4998739 4999573 You heard!
4999941 5001817 Prepare for arriving POWs! Let's move!
5076429 5077471 Glad you made it!
5148030 5150116 Rambo, I don't make the orders.
5150037 5152018 I take 'em, just like you.
5156069 5160240 I swear to God I didn't know it<br />was supposed to happen like this.
5160210 5162816 It was just supposed to<br />be another assignment.
5170087 5171129 Mission...
5172890 5173933 ...accomplished!
5181116 5183201 You know there's more men out there.
5184063 5185627 You know where they are.
5188205 5189769 Find 'em...
5190007 5191571 ...or I'll find you!
5213681 5214620 John!
5215582 5216938 Where are you going?
5217784 5218734 I don't know.
5221197 5223282 You'll get a second<br />Medal of Honor for this.
5231409 5232973 They should give it to them.
5234211 5235775 They deserve it more.
5237103 5239814 You can't keep running,<br />John. You're free now.
5240925 5241967 Come back with us.
5244111 5245153 Back to what?
5246900 5248359 My friends died here...
5250403 5251863 Part of me died here...
5253751 5256149 The war, everything that happened<br />here may have been wrong,
5256149 5258130 but dammit, don't<br />hate your country for it!
5259959 5260898 Hate?
5261962 5263317 I'd die for it!
5265375 5266835 Then what is it you want?
5272304 5273346 I want...
5276309 5277561 ...what they want,
5278312 5281544 and every other guy who came over here,
5282100 5286896 and spilt his guts and gave<br />everything he had, wants...
5288113 5289989 ...for our country to love us...
5290861 5293259 ...as much as we love it.
5295440 5296900 That's what I want.
5303483 5305047 How will you live, John?
5305385 5306635 Day by day.
