28876 30969 Thousands took to the streets<br />and thousands kill...
31012 36171 Many peaceful protesting monks have been<br />killed, some burnt alive and others drowned..
36207 38380 Foreign journalists have been shot and caned..
38418 42112 Thousands of villages have been destroyed.<br />Rape and torture are a daily occurrence.
42256 44915 In Burma there are more landmines,<br />than anywhere in the world.
44959 48612 Young men are bitten and forced into<br />the army. Many as young as 12 years old.
48661 50661 Beheadings and mutilations<br />are common.
50767 55533 The Karen people comprising mostly of poor Christian<br />farmers have been singled out for extermination.
55603 59963 The military government wants many of<br />the abundance resources on the Karen land.
60006 64174 The bloody military campaign against the Karen<br />people has been going on for almost 60 years.
65817 68887 The longest radical civil war in the world.
140849 142849 Ready. Send them out!
168096 170496 Move!
176665 178165 Shoot them all!
414365 417566 Fuck off, OK?
450707 452707 Looks like dangerous work.
454408 456408 I am Michael Burnett.
456707 458557 Do you have some time to talk?
458593 460273 Won't take too long, I promise.
460307 463108 I was told it might be possible to<br />rent your boat. We like to do that.
463143 465273 Is that possible?
465307 466307 We need to get up river.
466343 467908 Where are you going?
468007 468807 Into Burma.
469707 471273 Burma is a war zone.
471307 473108 That's what people call it.
473143 474908 But it's more like genocide than war.
476574 479274 Anyway, this will be my fifth trip in,
479374 482173 so we are aware of all the risks.
484413 487014 I don't go that far north.
487113 490178 Let me explain our situation.
490213 492014 Our church is part of the Pan-Asia<br />ministry..
492314 493213 located in Colorado.
493913 496413 We are all volunteers, whom<br />around this time of the year,
496514 499713 bring in medical supplies,<br />medical attention..
499814 503678 prayer books and support for<br />the Karen tribe's people.
503713 506514 People say you know the river<br />better than anyone.
506548 507514 They lied.
507913 510314 So what I am asking is that we compensate you...
510613 512014 for a few hours of your time..
512813 514514 that will help change people's lives.
517713 519413 Are you bringing in any weapons?
519913 521264 Of course not.
521298 522614 You are not changing anything.
527014 530213 It's thinking like that,<br />that keeps the world the way it is.
531173 532337 Fuck the world.
535437 536638 - Let's go<br />- Why?
536673 537837 He's not interested.
538038 540138 - Let me try.<br />- Sara...
540173 541738 It'll be an interesting trip going up there.
541773 542638 What do we have to lose?.
543138 545337 Let me try.
545638 546337 Sarah.
555929 557230 Hello?
557730 562129 I am Sarah Miller. Hope you don't<br />mind me coming back here.
562929 565429 The man you were talking to...
565465 567529 I wasn't talking to anybody.
568129 571995 Ok, the man that was talking to you..
572029 575129 asked if we could hire your boat<br />to go up river.
575730 577730 and you said no, why?
577764 579730 Can't help you out.
580129 584629 If you have some reasons,<br />mind if I heard them?
586929 590529 Go home.
745577 747577 Why did you come back?
749433 751033 Waiting for you.
754933 757033 I told you before,<br />I can't help you.
757433 759433 We need to know why you<br />can't help these people.
759734 760933 We are here to make a difference.
760969 763334 We believe all lives are special.
763369 764600 Some lives, some no.
764635 765798 Really?
765834 768234 If everyone thought like you,<br />nothing will ever change.
768269 768834 Nothing will change.
768933 770899 Of course it does.<br />Nothing stays the same.
770933 772584 Value your life, it's a good one
772619 774234 It's what I am trying to do!
774334 776734 No, what you are trying to do<br />is change what is.
776769 778933 And what is?
779234 781333 Go home.
783634 787533 Really.<br />Go home.
812802 815067 Maybe...
815101 817802 Maybe you lost your faith in people.
818101 823201 But you feel the same for something.<br />You must still care for something.
824802 826802 Maybe we can't change what it is,
828601 833601 But trying to save a life,<br />isn't wasting your life. Is it?
858327 861227 As bad as these people are,<br />they will eventually lose.
861263 864128 They can't keep it up against a united front.
864163 864927 They can't!
865427 869827 Time alone will tell. In the meantime,<br />we just got to hold it together.
870028 872028 Just the other day...
872062 873827 Excuse me, Sara?
873927 875677 Where are you going?
875712 877427 To talk to him.
877927 879327 He'll probably want his privacy.
879628 881028 Michael, you shouldn't worry,<br />he's helping us.
881062 882445 He's being paid.
882480 884028 He didn't take anything.
892716 894515 Thank you again for doing this.
894615 896115 Really from all of us.
897727 899628 You never told us your name.
900628 902128 John.
903227 904827 Where are you from?
905528 907128 Arizona.
907827 910628 - Why did you leave?<br />- I got drafted in Vietnam.
910663 912227 And you just stayed?
913128 915028 It's complicated.
915327 917128 You have a family back home?
917427 919427 Father maybe.<br />I don't know.
921727 925427 Aren't you curious to see what<br />might have changed back home?
927028 928927 Don't have a reason for that.
934761 936162 Sara.
937062 939361 Because of you we going,<br />I'll approve it..
939662 941761 anytime you want to turn around...
941797 943461 ...it is done.
944562 946062 Ok.
998597 1000498 What is it?<br />Who are they?
1000533 1001998 Burmese pirates.
1002498 1004197 Everyone sit down,<br />don't make a sound.
1005298 1008998 - It's all right.<br />- Don't talk.
1047692 1049991 - Are there more of them?<br />- Maybe.
1050027 1051592 We will know?
1051692 1053991 We should keep going.<br />We made a commitment.
1053991 1055592 I ain't talking to you.
1055692 1059092 What do you want to do? - We are a<br />group here. They want to vote. Vote.
1060626 1061656 Sit down!
1061692 1063092 If it is money they want...
1066192 1068491 Nobody talks. Heads down!
1198817 1201317 What are you doing?
1201317 1204218 We come here to stop the killing.<br />Who are you to kill?
1204252 1206182 - Who are you?<br />- Let him go!
1206218 1210917 You want them to rape her<br />fifty times and cut her head off!
1210952 1211984 Who are you?
1212019 1213917 Who are any of you?
1215019 1217318 We are going back.
1223528 1226728 No. We shouldn't go back!
1228127 1229792 Let go.
1229827 1232627 - What are you doing?<br />- We are so close!
1232663 1234593 What has happened here is horrible...
1234627 1238827 But what the people in there are<br />being killed like this every day.
1238863 1244327 Michael this was your idea.<br />We made a commitment.
1244363 1247228 I know you don't believe<br />in what we are doing,
1247327 1248827 But it is our lives.
1248863 1250228 Our choice.
1252327 1254627 You are not going to change anything.
1256427 1258192 Please
1258228 1259827 Please John.
1260327 1261728 Please
1274528 1276928 Go sit down.
1334842 1338842 We are taking the overland route on the way<br />back, so there is no need to wait around.
1340241 1342142 I have to report this.
1342541 1345142 I know you think what you did is right,..
1345176 1347142 but taking a life is never right.
1363324 1365723 I don't know what to say.
1365824 1369824 Maybe you shouldn't say anything.<br />Should you? Good Luck.
1550769 1552170 Open your mouth.
1588405 1591506 We signify your faith with<br />this little flower, ok?
1606705 1608905 Hey dear. Can you hand<br />over the bandages?
1632962 1635962 Get out of here!<br />What about them?  Go on, take them!
1849347 1851948 ......calling Raven.
1851982 1853548 Over...
1854948 1855948 What am I?
1856048 1858548 We made you this way.<br />You are a full blooded combat soldier.
1859548 1861147 Talk to me Johnny!
1861347 1862413 You don't just turn it off!
1862448 1867048 - It's over!<br />- Nothing is over!
1872048 1875748 Aren't you curious how things<br />might have changed back home?
1876448 1878512 You have done enough damage!
1878548 1881847 You will always be tearing away soldier..
1882248 1884313 till you come to terms with what you are.
1884347 1886948 So you are just going to stay here forever?
1889847 1890748 John Rambo!
1892048 1893048 John.
1893748 1895347 John Rambo.
1908640 1910440 My name is Arthur Marsh.
1911339 1914140 Pastor of Christ Church Colorado.
1914740 1916339 I need to talk with you.
1916740 1920640 It is very important, otherwise<br />I won't come here like this.
1924395 1926296 The morning of the day the group left,..
1926695 1928861 Michael Burnet notified me...
1928895 1931796 that they were traveling through this location.
1934695 1935895 What happened?
1935996 1937496 No one knows exactly.
1937596 1940796 They will supposed to return 10 days ago,<br />but they never came back.
1940996 1943996 I requested help from the embassy,<br />but they can't help.
1944096 1945796 Not in Burma and not in time.
1948586 1950185 How do you know they are alive?.
1950286 1954185 Because we have been in contact<br />with the Karen freedom fighters,
1954221 1957286 who say they think they know<br />where they were taken.
1957685 1961685 I was given the name of an ex-military<br />American local from the embassy..
1961885 1965385 who put me in touch with men who say they<br />have experience in this part of the world.
1965421 1966185 Mercenaries?
1967586 1969286 Yes.
1970385 1971851 I don't have any other choice.
1971885 1975885 You know the exact spot.<br />We need you to take these men,
1975921 1979086 to where you let our people off.
1979185 1980685 When are they ready to leave?
1981786 1982885 When you are.
2001319 2003420 You know what you are.
2004519 2006819 What you are made off.
2009119 2010720 War is in your blood.
2012420 2013920 Don't fight it.
2015920 2018319 Did you kill for your country?
2019019 2022019 Did you kill for yourself?
2026130 2029130 God is never going to make that go away.
2034329 2036230 When you are pushed...
2040730 2042930 Killing is as easy as breathing.
2071016 2073166 Look at this fucking place!
2073201 2075307 Only a fucking ape would live here!
2075342 2077416 What a fuck am I doing here?
2077451 2080115 Hey, knock that shit off!
2080215 2081880 And you don't like the arts?
2081916 2084315 And you don't like the shit.<br />I like your sister, Diaz.
2084416 2085916 She got a thing for retards.
2086016 2087615 Hey boatman!
2088715 2091016 How much longer in this ancient piece of shit?
2094615 2097615 What did the reverent say?
2097715 2099815 Something about his flock went missing.
2099916 2103465 I said look mate, that is what you get<br />when you're trespassing into fucking Burma.
2104719 2108099 That's what you get, when you go around<br />sniffing other people's garbage.
2108134 2112134 You know those generals in there are making millions,<br />cranking up more than anyone in this planet.
2112168 2113034 Bullshit!
2113333 2116134 Millions, Moron. How do you<br />think they paid for that shit all ?
2116168 2118851 Try to read the papers<br />instead of sticking under it.
2118885 2121534 The general is the biggest junkies<br />of all of them.
2121568 2123099 It's noble Louis..
2123134 2127134 You are? Those people going in<br />without weapons.
2127168 2129333 Just books and medicine.
2129434 2130833 It's noble.
2130869 2132099 Ok, schoolboy!
2132134 2134233 You stick your nose in other people's<br />business, you get fucked up...
2134268 2135733 or you are dead.
2136789 2139440 The only reason I am doing this<br />is for an ex-wife and 3 kids.
2139474 2142090 and after the shit is over, you can<br />shove that right up your ass.
2142125 2144155 - Try to think careful, mate!<br />- Back off!
2144190 2146690 And you, I don't want to die of old age<br />before I get there. So move.
2154581 2157282 You said something?
2278222 2284422 Is it me? Or is it the air coming in<br />smelling like some wet dog?
2286121 2289322 For fuck sake, I can swim faster than this.
2289422 2292422 - Am I right?<br />- We dead.
2293422 2297621 Chop, chop. The quicker we are there,<br />the quicker we get back.
2302021 2304822 Those idiots.
2305621 2307887 They come here..
2307922 2309722 start all the trouble...
2311422 2314621 ... expecting the whole world to work<br />like their old neighbours. Well it doesn't..
2316121 2318922 So they send in the devil...
2319422 2322021 ... to do god's work.<br />Ironic isn't it?
2324322 2326322 Am I boring you man?
2327722 2331222 Is it the trip? It's got you nervous?
2331318 2333018 Because we..
2333119 2335420 ...we really appreciate the action.<br />You know what I mean?
2335820 2338221 Look at me in the eyes if<br />you know what I am saying.
2341530 2343530 Oh dear..
2344030 2346829 You are really an uptight master,<br />aren't you?
2348730 2350880 You can drop the act in your stare.
2350914 2353030 I have seen it all before.
2353730 2355530 I am not impressed.
2367467 2370818 He's old school, SAS.
2370853 2374168 The first rate soldier to be<br />told to go maniac.
2375268 2377668 They call him schoolboy.
2378168 2380768 The name stuck with him since.
2381768 2384668 The name he start calling me<br />no matter how many people I shoot.
2412969 2415269 What do you want from us?
2463012 2465112 One man and a kid in a chicken coop.
2465547 2467376 This sort of rebel they put up.
2467411 2471311 I am not liking it You are in a jungle,<br />there is nothing to like.

2476711 2478777 What's with the kid?
2479525 2483726 He's a good tracker.<br />We don't need a tracker. We need a guide.
