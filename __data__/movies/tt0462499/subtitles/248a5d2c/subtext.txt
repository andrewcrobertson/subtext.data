459240 460270 John!
461160 462288 John Rambo!
467681 469099 I don't believe this!
476400 478699 - So where you're coming from?<br />- Washington.
479641 481796 - Good to see you again!<br />- Yeah, you too.
483921 485600 Do you want to tell me about it?
486801 487780 About what?
488241 491757 About yesterday, I've seen you stick<br />fighting in a warehouse in Bangkok.
492202 494352 - You saw that?<br />- Yeah.
495002 497695 And today I find you,<br />working in a monastery.
498641 501501 They let me live here and<br />I help out, fixing things.
501641 503019 And the stick fighting?
503920 505398 I just do that for their lack of money.
507882 510237 Yeah...I saw you give it to the monks.
510882 511871 You see a lot.
515282 516520 Colonel, who are they?
516721 518359 They're part of the reason I'm here.
521003 523980 This is Robert Griggs, he's a<br />field officer of our local embassy.
524322 525391 John Rambo.
526442 527595 Pleasure.
528362 529801 Well, you're sure not easy to find!
530002 531441 Why are you keepin' track?
532403 535434 Well, like the Colonel says,<br />good men are hard to find!
539163 541653 John, I'd like you to take a<br />look at some of these photos.
542484 544475 I don't know how much you<br />know about Afghanistan.
544924 547484 Most people can't even find it on a map!
547923 550039 But over two million civilians,
550433 552533 mostly peasants<br />farmers and their families,
552534 556234 have been systematically<br />slaughtered by invading Russian armies.
556604 558799 Every new weapon,
561604 564676 including chemical warfare, has<br />been used to eliminate these people.
565224 567581 And they've been very<br />successful, at many levels.
568925 572481 I assume that you're out of touch<br />with the current states of the war.
573204 574842 But after nine years of fighting,
575284 577702 the Afghan Forces are now<br />getting their Stinger missiles,
577703 580120 and are now beginning to hold<br />their own against the Air-Strikes.
580565 584001 Except for one region,<br />50 miles over the border.
584925 588058 Apparently, the Soviet Commander<br />there is exceptionally brutal,
588205 589797 as those photos indicate.
590245 593299 And he's managed to string<br />allow all aid from the outside.
594526 596596 So we want to...
598086 600480 investigate the problem firsthand.
600725 602497 And what that's got to do with me?
604605 606004 They've asked me to go in.
606905 608003 You're not gonna do it?
608326 611602 Yes. And I want you to<br />come with me, John.
612166 613542 I put in my time.
614043 615119 What does that mean?
616446 618119 It means my war is over.
628686 631665 I thought you said he<br />was this great soldier.
632607 633926 Well, Colonel...
634367 637001 that's like we've got a<br />long walk down those stairs.
652727 656004 Don't be tough on him,<br />he's just following orders.
657248 659203 This mission's important, John.
660048 661384 Do you really think we<br />can make a difference?
661385 663021 If I didn't, I wouldn't be going.
663168 666002 - It didn't before.<br />- That was another time.
667448 669007 Come with me, John.
673809 677483 I don't know what you think<br />about this place, but I like it.
677928 682402 I like bein' here, I like workin'<br />here. I like belong into something.
682449 685009 You DO belong into something. Not this.
686489 687983 When you're gonna come full circle?
688384 689777 What are you talkin' about?
690729 694086 You said that your war is over.<br />I think the one out there is,
694530 696486 but not the one inside you.
696930 700001 I know the reasons you're here, John.<br />But it doesn't work that way.
700420 704320 You may try, but you can't get<br />away from what you really are.
704369 705603 And what is it I am?
705604 707138 A full-blooded combat soldier.
707290 709485 Not any more. I dont want it.
709486 711681 That's too bad, 'cause<br />you're stuck with it.
712330 713729 Let me tell you a story, John.
714170 718049 There was a sculptor and he<br />found a stone, a special stone.
718490 720407 He dragged it home and he<br />worked on it for months,
720408 722025 until he finally finished.
722730 724730 When he was ready, he<br />showed it to his friends,
724731 726730 and they said he had<br />created a great statue.
727210 729046 The sculptor said he<br />hadn't created anything.
729047 731283 The statue was always there.
731722 734222 He just cleared away to small pieces.
735571 737729 We didn't make you<br />this fighting machine.
738971 741360 We just shifted away the rough edges.
741811 743936 Your own is gonna be<br />tearing away with yourself,
743937 746061 until you come to terms<br />with what you are!
746892 748564 Until you come full circle.
751291 753327 I guess I'm not ready yet.
758692 760444 Well, I got to move.
762692 766047 Promise me you'll look me<br />when you're next in the States.
766852 768001 I promise.
768532 769852 Colonel!
770533 774003 I'm sorry. But it's gotta<br />end for me sometime.
776875 777875 I understand.
858476 859928 Take cover!
884017 886990 Drop your weapons and<br />remain where you are!
888297 890016 You cannot escape!
895217 896970 Drop your weapons!
897418 898976 You have no chance of escape!
901058 902729 Drop your weapons!
903217 904172 Now!
929173 930073 Rambo!
932078 933427 Something went wrong.
933678 934615 What happened?
935216 937352 Soviets intercepted the<br />team, just over the border.
939059 941698 Among we've gathered,<br />Trautman and the rest of his party
941699 943938 have been taken to the<br />regional commandment post.
944459 946087 And what are you doing about it?
947580 949019 I can't do anything about it.
949620 950720 I'm sorry.
951180 953347 I just thought you should know.
955139 956388 What about me?
958739 959934 About you?
959935 961529 Can you get me in?
961980 963156 You're not serious.
963357 964733 Oh yeah, I'm serious.
967340 968579 It can't be done officially.
968580 970118 Make it unofficial.
971460 974660 If it can be done, I want you to<br />know upfront of your capture,
975341 976535 or any of this leaks,
976981 980770 we'll deny any participation, or<br />even knowledge of your existence.
982220 983573 I'm used to it.
985101 986419 We'll get back.
1068104 1071159 You want to buy? Many guns here!
1071464 1074099 No. I'm looking for Mousa Chanin.
1074985 1078022 - What's your name?<br />- John Rambo.
1080864 1082013 Wait here.
1103986 1105134 They sell many in Afghanistan.
1107785 1109184 Many landmines.
1109625 1111025 Landmines everywhere.
1112866 1115263 I am Mousa Chanin.<br />What is it you want?
1115364 1116661 I was sent by Griggs.
1118226 1120621 You do not look like<br />men Griggs sent before.
1120722 1123016 You not look like you are with military.
1123787 1125003 I'm not.
1125204 1126820 What you are? A mercenary?
1128507 1129884 No.
1129985 1131573 You're not a military, you're<br />not a mercenary, what are you?
1132074 1133361 Lost tourist?
1139307 1141023 I'm not a tourist.
1142587 1143744 Sorry.
1143845 1145401 Do you know where the American is?
1145547 1148022 Yes. In a Soviet fort.
1148387 1151858 Near the village of Khost,<br />30 miles over the border.
1152308 1154968 Mr. Griggs sent you the<br />supplies you asked for.
1155627 1156626 You wish to see them now?
1157027 1157926 Yeah.
1160707 1161962 Is this what you asked for?
1162663 1163617 Yeah.
1164148 1166537 Never seen these things<br />before. What are these?
1166988 1169422 - Detonators.<br />- And this?
1170468 1171696 What is this for?
1172988 1174365 It's blue light.
1174366 1175742 What does it do?
1176509 1178266 It turns blue.
1179367 1180224 I see.
1180868 1182886 Can you tell me how many<br />more men come with us?
1183028 1184939 There's no rescue team. There's just me.
1185666 1187466 Just you? Come on, this is no good!
1187567 1189466 I can not take only one man to the fort.
1189467 1191367 You need more men to help.
1191869 1194463 Griggs said you'd take<br />me there. Take me there!
1195069 1196963 I am meant to take medical supplies,
1196964 1199157 if I not take it, many people will die.
1199309 1200629 Do you understand?
1202150 1204027 Well, I do not know who you really are,
1204470 1207527 but by the way you look, I can see<br />you have no experience in war. Do you?
1208829 1210057 Come on, do you?
1211189 1213120 I've fired a few shots.
1216470 1218040 A few shots?
1218990 1221586 Come on, maybe you should go back home,
1221587 1223183 and think it all over again.
1223430 1224685 For a very long time.
1228911 1230663 I did think it over.
1231830 1233707 You did?
1234550 1236780 Well, this is your choice.
1237230 1240507 But let me tell you, you can<br />not get this American alone.
1241551 1244111 If you fail, do not blame me.
1244551 1246230 I will accept no responsibility.
1248711 1250167 Sounds familiar.
1283432 1287391 My name is Colonel Zaysen,<br />Regional Commander of this sector.
1291273 1295232 You're here as the first<br />American captured in Afghanistan.
1295953 1297625 Congratulations.
1299153 1301943 I believe you're planning to<br />supply enemy rebels forces
1301994 1305769 with Stinger missiles, intending<br />to destroy Soviet aircraft.
1306434 1307673 If I'm gonna be interrogated,
1307774 1310312 I wanna be interrogated<br />by your superiors.
1312233 1315032 Out here, I have no superiors.
1316794 1318222 I am in full command.
1320314 1322128 You're alone here.
1326315 1328385 Abandoned by your government.
1329875 1333469 - What do you want?<br />- Cooperation.
1336174 1340332 This sector has been under<br />total control for over five years.
1342035 1344629 There's little more I can do here.
1345315 1349324 It is, as you say, without challenges.
1352516 1354655 If you supply to me<br />worth information about most
1354656 1356994 stinger missiles<br />you're planning to deliver,
1357236 1359895 it could provide a way<br />out of this further post.
1361075 1364627 After all, the end what<br />everyone really wants...
1366596 1367711 ...is peace.
1368316 1370068 The Kremlin's got a hell<br />of a sense of humor.
1371636 1372751 Please explain.
1373236 1375694 You talk peace and<br />disarmament to the world,
1375695 1378152 and here you are, wiping<br />out a race of people.
1378597 1381475 We are wiping out no one.
1382077 1386308 I think you're too intelligent<br />to believe such a propaganda!
1387436 1389508 Now again: where are the missiles?
1389557 1391013 I don't know anything<br />about any missiles!
1391014 1392469 Of course you do!
1392917 1396056 But you do not seem to realize<br />I'm providing a way out for us both.
1396197 1397953 You expect sympathy?
1398877 1400915 You started this damn war,<br />now you have to deal with it!
1401157 1405376 And we will. It is just a matter of time<br />before we achieve a complete victory.
1405518 1406746 You know there won't be a victory.
1407376 1410432 Everyday, your war machines lose<br />ground to a bunch of poorly armed,
1410877 1412430 poorly equiped freedom-fighters!
1412677 1415272 The fact is that you<br />underestimated your competition.
1415732 1417082 If you studied your History,
1417083 1418732 you'd know this people<br />never gave up to anyone.
1418878 1422673 They'd rather die than be<br />slaves to an invading army.
1422918 1424595 You can't defeat a people like that.
1425238 1428137 We tried. We already had our Vietnam!
1429319 1431113 Now you're gonna have yours!
1431159 1434792 So, you wish to test me. Good.
1472600 1473955 This is Afghanistan.
1475400 1477556 Alexander the Great tried<br />to conquer this country,
1477840 1481729 then Ghenghis Khan, then<br />the British, now Russia.
1482781 1485399 But Afghan people fight<br />hard, they never be defeated.
1486680 1489977 Ancient enemy make prayer about<br />these people. Do you wish to hear?
1491201 1493840 Very good. It says:
1494281 1496431 "May God deliver us from<br />the venom of the cobra,
1496881 1500078 teeth of the tiger, and the<br />vengeance of the Afghans."
1502001 1503355 Understand what this means?
1505082 1507960 That you guys don't take any shit.
1508682 1511036 Yes, something like this.
1515841 1516752 We go now!
1550363 1553116 In the north, there are many<br />caves, we'll travel through them.
1553883 1555840 It'll be safer. We go!
1560244 1562518 This cave leads to the<br />"Valley of the Five Lions".
1563123 1567640 The Afghan King was asked to send<br />500 of his warriors into battle.
1568084 1569642 He sent only five.
1572404 1575077 His greatest five, and they won.
1575524 1578482 He said, it's better to send<br />five lions than 500 sheep.
1578924 1581964 - What do you think of this?<br />- I think the King was lucky.
1584125 1587594 - How much longer till the village?<br />- About two hours.
1598325 1601442 Where in my sector are the<br />missiles being delivered?
1605326 1606520 I don't know.
1607406 1608839 You liar.
1611885 1612840 Where?
1616405 1617600 Where?
1618326 1619884 OK, I'll tell ya.
1621766 1624326 I knew you were lying.
1624766 1628338 Now, where are the missiles located?
1630127 1631355 Close.
1632047 1633116 How close?
1635327 1636475 In your ass!
1648887 1651845 You've tried my patience long enough.
1659268 1661543 I tried to be civilian.
1692388 1693902 The name John Rambo...
1698709 1700548 ...do you know it?
1702229 1703184 No?
1704429 1706727 He says that there's a<br />plan for a rescue attempt
1706728 1709026 with the help of some of the rebels.
1709750 1712344 He also says he knows<br />where this man is going.
1717149 1718343 We will welcome him.
1736511 1739947 It's the last village in the<br />valley. About 200 man here.
1742150 1743770 There's a lot of lot of kids in.
1743971 1746190 Yes, and they are good fighters, too.
1746631 1748643 I'll tell the leaders you want to talk.
1755191 1756944 They've never seen men look like you.
1764271 1765410 Here are Mujahedin horsemen.
1765411 1768549 There are 10.000 horsemen<br />more waiting at the border.
1769111 1770469 They are waiting to get<br />weapons, when they'll get it,
1770470 1772327 they'll come back here to fight.
1790792 1792306 Let's go to the hospital.
1797633 1799591 He is the only doctor for 500 km.
1803393 1805543 The first medicine they<br />get in two months.
1814473 1818102 More gifts from the Soviets. They<br />look like toys, but they're mines.
1818553 1820713 We teach the childrens not to<br />touch, some of them too late.
1825114 1826593 Who's that?
1827034 1829025 His name is Juri. He's Russian.
1829474 1830632 A deserter?
1830633 1832990 He calls himself a defector.<br />There are many like him.
1833435 1837333 He is the one who can help the most,<br />he knows the inside of the fort.
1841154 1842710 I think we should go now.
1861676 1867352 Mines start here: one meter like<br />this, then two meters like this,
1867795 1868944 and like this.
1869395 1871910 There are four towers, four guards,
1872356 1875348 here, here, here and here.
1875916 1877055 Where do they keep the prisoners?
1877456 1878594 Here.
1879436 1882508 If we get in there,<br />is there another way out?
1883276 1885637 Underground, where<br />there's all dirty water.
1886277 1888393 But I do not know word for this place.
1888837 1891066 He means sewer. Where is it?
1891516 1895634 Here. Outside, you go there.<br />Guards patrolls there.
1896437 1898189 I do not think you go this way.
1898877 1900913 I wish we go to the minefields.<br />They'll never expect it.
1901357 1905369 This can not be done.<br />There are many Spetnaz commandos.
1906117 1908735 We have all of this,<br />we've lost many men.
1909678 1910737 We'll lose more men if we go there.
1911738 1913396 I don't need many men.
1914798 1915996 What is it you want to do?
1917317 1918476 I need two men to lead<br />me to the minefield,
1918477 1920036 and two to help to escape.
1920477 1923515 If this is done, Soviets<br />will come here like before,
1923958 1924976 and more people will die.
1925977 1927194 I can't wait.
1927838 1930193 You must wait for help the way we wait.
1932358 1934871 - Then I'll go alone.<br />- And you will die!
1937759 1939351 Then I'll die.
1944518 1945633 Wait!
1947079 1948353 Please don't go.
1956159 1957558 My name is Masoud.
1958999 1960078 You must not judge us,
1960079 1962857 before you understand why<br />we are not directed to help.
1965440 1967430 Most of the Afghan<br />people are very strong,
1967879 1970713 and we are determined not<br />to be driven from our land.
1972160 1976136 Our children die of disease,<br />mines, and poison gas.
1977280 1979594 And our women are raped and killed.
1980240 1984392 Last year, in the valley of<br />Legman, the next valley,
1984841 1986219 6.000 Afghans were killed.
1988161 1990675 Pregnant women were cut with bayonets,
1992120 1994315 and their babies thrown into the fire.
1995080 1999233 This is done, so they will not have to<br />fight the next generation of Afghans.
1999681 2002991 Yet nobody sees anything, or<br />reads anything in the papers.
2004481 2005915 What you see here,
2007361 2009317 are the Mujahedin soldiers,
2009801 2011121 holy warriors.
2011562 2014281 To us, this war is a holy war.
2014722 2017116 And there is no true<br />death for a Mujahedin,
2017117 2019511 because we have taken our last nights,
2019961 2022715 and because we consider us already dead.
2023642 2027032 To us, death for our<br />land and God is an honor.
2027482 2028791 So, my friend,
2030242 2034554 what we must do is to stop this<br />killing of our women and children.
2036323 2038273 If getting this man free,
2038936 2044736 so he can tells to the free world, and<br />tell what happens here, is necessary
2044782 2046479 then of course we will help.
2048723 2053160 Leave us now, so we may<br />speak among ourselves
2053603 2056037 and find the best way to free this man.
2061564 2064124 - Thank you.<br />- We thank you.
2087325 2090158 Don't worry, they will decide soon.
2090605 2092862 - We got to leave tonight.<br />- What is your name?
2096404 2098635 This boy is very hard inside.
2099085 2100599 His parents were killed last year.
2102045 2104605 His brother died in the<br />fort where the American is.
2105045 2107878 He looks like a boy, but<br />he fights like a man.
2108325 2110555 - What's your name?<br />- Rambo.
2111005 2113725 - Where are you from?<br />- Arizona.
2114166 2115902 Arizona? How much days walk?
2117103 2118238 About two years.
2118685 2119880 Two years...
2121325 2123875 - Are you a soldier?<br />- No more.
2125326 2128045 I am a soldier. Are you here to fight?
2128486 2130558 - No.<br />- Are you scared?
2133526 2135801 What is this?
2136246 2137225 It's a knife.
2137226 2138805 - Can I see this?<br />- Sure.
2146406 2147725 Very good. Can I have it?
2148166 2149121 No.
2151207 2153118 - What is this?<br />- You want everything!
2153567 2156081 - This is for luck.<br />- What is luck?
2156527 2157960 Luck is...
2160087 2161822 Can I have it? I need luck.
2161823 2163558 So do I!
2166968 2170164 What a child! Always like this.
2173087 2175727 Look there! It's our national sport.
2176168 2178619 An old, insane game,<br />maybe 3.000 years old!
2179768 2181042 Look, they never stop playing.
2184928 2186943 War or not war, they don't mind.
2187889 2190528 - You like it?<br />- I'll take football.
2190969 2194005 What is football? You<br />play it with the foot?
2194448 2195563 Not really.
2206049 2207368 Come on, let's go!
2218730 2221562 - What are they saying?<br />- They want you to try.
2222009 2225719 It's a way to them for you to be with<br />them. If you want to try, go ahead but
2226170 2228445 I'm not responsible for it!
2232370 2234361 - I'll try it.<br />- Yes?
2236250 2237345 What are the rules?
2237446 2239941 Well, you have to take<br />the sheep once around,
2240091 2242764 and then thrown it in the circle.
2243331 2244345 Why?
2244446 2245560 Because there is a circle there.
2247730 2249925 - That's it?<br />- That's it! Very simple.
2252071 2253566 Like football.
2253567 2255761 God must love crazy people!
2256571 2258829 - Why?<br />- He makes so many of them!
2698789 2700619 Now you see how it is here.
2701948 2704781 Somewhere in a war,<br />there's supposed to be honor.
2705228 2707584 Where is the honor here? Where?
2710509 2713182 We're taking the survivors to<br />the border. Are you coming?
2714749 2715977 I'm going to the fort.
2716429 2718659 Have you not seen enough death?
2719390 2723781 Go away while you can.<br />This is not your war.
2726829 2728387 It is now.
2732070 2734789 So be it.
2735230 2736504 You are a good friend.
2746671 2749060 I stay. I will show you the way.
2749511 2750784 I will go too.
2751870 2752859 No, you go with them.
2753310 2757623 I will not. They killed all<br />my family. I want to fight!
2758711 2761179 Not with me. You go!
2762631 2763586 Go on.
2768751 2770105 Why must you do this?
2772072 2773869 Cause he'd do it for me.
2798633 2800510 Are you decided to talk?
2801552 2802507 No?
2803832 2804742 Very well.
2805952 2809832 Soon you will be my<br />guest down the hall...
2897957 2899185 - Go back!<br />- No!
2899637 2900626 Go back!
2928357 2929585 Go on!
2931517 2932734 Stay here! Stay back.
2932735 2934351 I know this place. You need me!
2934798 2937392 I don't need you dead!<br />Now go back. You understand?
3343334 3344323 American?
3345854 3347048 American?
3368575 3370213 Colonel? Colonel?
3376295 3378287 John? How the hell did you get in here?
3378736 3381455 - Can you move?<br />- I can.
3383415 3384564 Let's go!
3389335 3390273 John, behind you!
3400656 3402135 Go!
3407497 3409612 John, get out of here!<br />Get the hell outta here!
3521961 3523679 Over here!
3524121 3524997 Come on!
3531642 3532961 Help me!
3566443 3567922 Take him!
3588603 3589558 Come on!
3593484 3594678 Give me the boy!
3613684 3615117 Come!
3626765 3627595 Come on!
3629646 3630761 Take the kid!
3633966 3635115 Jump down!
3705609 3708077 Give me the boy!
3760091 3763969 Who is this terrorist? What<br />makes you so valuable to him?
3764410 3767920 This bastard tried to destroy<br />me tonight. But he failed!
3768170 3772244 At sunrise, I will track him down, and<br />have his skin hanging on the wall!
3772691 3775763 - You don't have to hunt him.<br />- What?
3776211 3777724 He'll find you.
3780811 3782962 Are you insane?
3783412 3786370 One man against trained commandos?
3786812 3790326 Who do you think this man is? God?
3792171 3795289 No. God would have mercy. He won't!
3808933 3810992 It's all right. There's nobody there.
3811093 3811952 Good.
3812093 3813109 This will hold a while.
3814610 3816026 What's the fastest way outta here?
3816672 3819211 Northwest, there's a<br />trail between mountains,
3819453 3823128 about three kilometers from<br />here. The trail is very difficult.
3825053 3827806 - You take the boy and go.<br />- I want to stay.
3828333 3829664 You can't.
3831453 3834491 You can not go back there.<br />We must all go to Pakistan.
3835134 3836749 No, I gotta go back.
3837250 3839365 I know he's your friend,<br />but you can't do this!
3839813 3842287 You both will die.<br />For what? Come with us!
3842388 3843362 Just do what I say.
3845814 3848248 Give me your gun.
3853294 3856047 All right, let's go. Come on!
3872495 3874486 I will see you again?
3875215 3876170 Sure.
4218828 4220147 Come on!
4230989 4232068 Can you fly that thing?
4232669 4233547 Let's find out.
4257270 4258862 Let's go!
4284791 4286019 Hold on!
4295871 4297304 Over there!
4302912 4303822 There!
4322432 4323865 Hold on!
4324312 4325587 Get him up!
4326033 4327910 Take my hand!
4351434 4352344 We're going down!
4367315 4368145 Hold on!
4384075 4385633 Take what you can!
4386075 4388464 - Come on, move it, move it!<br />- Go on!
4400555 4402626 - We gotta hit the border.<br />- We stay here.
4403076 4404475 We know where to go.
4404916 4407794 - Which direction, John?<br />- Northeast!
4453918 4455351 Hold it, John!
4458558 4460114 I gotta rest a minute.
4462238 4463195 How's your wound?
4464196 4466152 You taught us to ignore<br />the pain, didn't ya?
4466599 4467774 Has it worked?
4469175 4470150 Not really!
4471638 4473191 Don't take it personally!
4474798 4475753 Thanks.
4495600 4498159 You go on ahead and see if<br />you can find some cover.
4567443 4569752 That was close, John! How are you?
4570603 4571918 Well done!
4582923 4585881 We won't make it easy for them.<br />We'd better split out!
4587123 4589193 I'm sorry I got you into this, John!
4589643 4591156 No, you're not!
4649285 4652516 - Are you listening?<br />- Who are you?
4653845 4655962 Your worst nightmare.
4765370 4766326 It's good timing!
4766827 4767782 What are friends for?
4769992 4772392 You go back to the hole. I'll cover<br />you, and see if there's any more left.
4961858 4963753 Across the valley is the border.
4965898 4967168 We did it, John!
4969538 4970766 Wait!
4974539 4976495 What the hell is that?
4979738 4981137 The son of a bitch!
5006019 5008328 Do not try to retreat!
5008859 5010179 You can not escape.
5010620 5012850 We will not attack if you do not run!
5013500 5014715 We do not want to hurt you.
5015716 5016731 Somehow I don't believe him!
5017180 5021014 I order you to come forward,<br />and you will be given a fair trial.
5021460 5023911 Drop your weapons,<br />and remain where you are.
5024061 5025779 You got any ideas?
5027101 5029375 Drop your weapons!
5030020 5031670 Surrounding them, Sir.
5033260 5035775 Helluva time for humor, John!
5036221 5038530 Drop your weapons! Now!
5039981 5041573 You have no chance of escape.
5042021 5045650 Come forward! I want<br />to pick you back alive.
5046101 5048218 This is your last warning!
5051342 5052536 The choice is yours.
5052982 5054573 What do you say, John?
5056701 5058661 Fuck 'em!
5076143 5078531 If we're gonna go, I would<br />crave to take that bastard with us!
5115104 5116173 What is that?
5125785 5127423 It's the rebels!
5139545 5140295 Come on!
5356114 5356989 John, get out of there!
5449117 5452474 You're sure you don't want to stay?<br />You fight good for a tourist!
5455318 5456693 Maybe next time.
5458038 5459595 Do you want this back?
5460597 5463065 No. You keep it.
5463757 5465350 Can you not stay?
5478599 5479873 I gotta go.
5503640 5504993 Goodbye.
5512839 5513856 Hard to believe, John!
5514657 5515574 What's that, Sir?
5515920 5519993 Well, I hate to admit it, but the<br />truth is I think we're getting soft!
5521440 5522993 Maybe just a little, Sir...
5523694 5525094 Just a little!
