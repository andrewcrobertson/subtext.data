46296 50509 Come on, time to go.<br />We haven't got all day.
50676 53095 Get that monkey on the train.
54721 58141 The Medici Brothers' circus is taking off!
178220 179221 Breathing normal...
179930 181431 heart rate normal.
182599 183892 You're cleared to perform.
185185 187563 Milly!<br />Another train!
194486 196488 Niños, wait!<br />We are coming, too!
208959 210085 Joplin!
210669 211712 Joplin, Missouri!
212421 214673 -Hey, sweetheart!<br />-Daddy!
245913 248457 Oh, I meant to tell ya.
248624 250125 You know, in the letter I sent?
251335 254630 I'm so sorry that I wasn't here.
255714 257048 Well, come here now.
258175 259384 Still me.
266600 268101 And you...
270103 271438 you're just as pretty as your momma.
280239 281406 We missed you, Dad.
283033 284284 I missed you, too.
288288 290499 Ivan and Catherine, thank you both...
290666 292209 for looking out for them.
292376 293794 Captain Farrier, of course.
293961 295587 It's Holt, come on now.
295754 297005 It's just Holt.
297172 298674 Don't you worry.
300384 302511 Everything's gonna be<br />just like it was before.
306682 307683 Come on! Come on!
307850 309142 Home sweet home.
309309 311436 -Hey! Holt!<br />-Hey, Puck.
312604 313730 -Hey, Thomas.<br />-Milly, come on!
313897 315065 Hi, Holt.
316692 318235 Hey, Miss Atlantis.
320028 321572 Pramesh!
321738 323365 The very best journey, dear friend.
323532 325784 The road that leads home.
325951 327035 Welcome home.
330455 331456 No hugs!
332875 335377 Pramesh, I missed you, too.
335544 338589 What's going on?<br />The camp's half the size it used to be.
338755 341216 Hard times, my friend.<br />For everyone.
347723 349474 Attention, everybody!
349933 353854 Why is Rule Number One<br />called Rule Number One?
354021 358817 Because "keep the cages locked"<br />is the most important rule of all!
358984 362487 When I catch that fugitive scalawag<br />who interrupted my dream...
362654 363530 Rongo!
363697 364948 Where is Rongo?
367159 368994 Who's heading camp management?
369161 370162 I'm the strongman.
370329 372873 Yes, but we're all wearing multiple hats!
373040 376627 You're in charge of budgets,<br />and accounting, and inventory.
376793 379254 Which means animal whereabouts!
379421 381298 Now, go find that monkey!
381465 383342 I'll have a look around.
390265 391808 All right, everybody. Back to work.
396063 397231 Holt!
407366 410869 This winter, the influenza<br />hit us like a hurricane.
411620 414289 Natalya, Vincenzo...
414456 417000 the Vanderjees, and then...
418377 420379 your wife.
420546 422172 Poor Annie.
424800 426468 How she fought.
429680 431223 She was the best of us.
432349 434101 I know it.
434268 438313 So, you know, for her,<br />let's have our best season yet!
439690 441233 Now where's my horses?
443485 445112 Funny story about that.
445279 446530 Funny how?
446697 447656 He sold them.
448782 450492 But our act is the soul of this show!
450659 455038 And first, we lost you,<br />and then Annie, to ride 'em!
455205 457374 If only Milly would have learned the trade.
457541 459042 I don't wanna be a show-off in your circus.
459209 461211 -"Show-off"?<br />-You see?
461378 463714 I wanna make scientific discoveries.
463881 465549 I wanna be noticed for my mind.
465716 466717 Okay.
466884 470679 Then learn clairvoyance. Telepathy!<br />Something!
470846 473724 I can do a handstand for almost ten seconds.
476310 479771 "Child does handstand."<br />We'll be broke by July.
480272 483066 Hang on now.<br />Without horses, what the hell's my act?
484026 485986 The crowds come to see me!
486445 487487 Max, please.
488947 490824 I need to work.
492242 493702 Good news.
493869 495495 One job, I have.
495662 497623 Okay, then. Give me a showstopper.
497789 500959 You know that old rascal Itchy McPhee?<br />He finally ran off with the bearded lady.
501126 504254 I've been filling in with<br />roustabouts ever since.
505255 507257 I need somebody good to tend the elephants.
507424 509301 No, you're not serious.
509468 510594 I am on occasion.
510761 512221 This is a big job and you know it.
512386 513804 No, it's a big shovel for a big pile of...
513972 514972 Dad.
517601 520562 So you sold my horses<br />and kept your elephants.
520729 523899 Your scrawny, mangy, cut-rate elephants.
524066 526443 They're important.<br />Especially this season.
526944 527945 Why's that?
528111 530072 I know it goes against my nature...
530239 533867 but for once, I made an investment.
537204 539081 There she is!
539248 541792 Our brand-new Asian female.
541959 546880 I bought her off a Brugelbecker in Biloxi.<br />I had to get him way down on the price.
547047 551593 But I swear to you, Holt,<br />I saw something special in her eyes.
551760 554680 This is your investment?<br />An old, sick elephant.
555222 557391 Oh, no. She's not sick.
558350 559810 Any day now...
559977 562145 She's having a baby.
566650 569278 Dad, watch! Dad! I'm getting better!
569444 570988 Hang on now, this is our tent?
572364 573699 What happened to our things?
573866 576910 We had nice furniture, we had rooms.
578120 580247 Max, what didn't you sell?
580414 581748 You son of a gun.
581915 583333 Dad, look!
583959 585127 Toys?
585294 588505 They're not toys.<br />They're for my science experiments.
588922 591175 Well, we're a circus, darlin', a circus.
591341 593844 We need to be practical<br />if we want to survive.
594011 596471 You couldn't just take up one act?
596638 598849 Tumblin' or tightrope?
599016 600851 Maybe I don't need the world staring at me.
602186 603770 Maybe I'm just not you and Mom.
603937 605230 Well, who makes the rules in this family?
605689 606690 Mom did.
606857 608483 Yeah, well, I make them now.
608650 610402 So just... Go to your room!
610569 611820 This is my room.
613155 614865 This is all our rooms.
615449 617034 See this?
617576 619119 You know what this is?
619286 620787 It's your inheritance.
622998 624082 Dad!
624625 627753 Don't worry, he's not going anywhere.
627920 629588 He's stuck here.
629755 631507 Like you and me.
645145 646772 Come on, come on,<br />you're missing it!
649066 652152 Look, I can do it!<br />I'm doing it, Milly!
652319 654071 A new season!
667251 669461 Let me in, you little hairball!
677261 678345 Hey!
679638 682224 Would somebody please let me in my own train?
725934 727352 Dad, wake up! Let's go!
727519 728687 The elephants need us!
728854 731607 Good God, son,<br />you're gonna make me miss the war.
732816 735110 Gimme that. Go on, lead the way.
735277 737070 Move it!
739740 742117 Let's skedaddle, Mrs. Jumbo!<br />Don't make me have to incentivize.
742284 744077 Get her out of there, boys.
746455 747831 Easy, Rufus.
747998 749166 That's a lady in there.
749333 752127 Well, well, our own Tom Mix<br />ridin' in to the rescue.
752294 754421 But he just ain't on the marquee no more.
754588 756173 Time to see what he's been missing.
756340 757799 Do you ever get that feeling?
757966 759259 Like there's something you're missing?
759426 761553 Imagine my surprise, you didn't enlist.
761720 763639 Weak ticker. Doc's advice.
764306 767100 Dad? Something's wrong.
767309 768894 She doesn't wanna leave.
773440 774441 Come on!
774608 776109 Let's get her outta there!
778904 779988 What are you doing?
780155 780864 Come on!
782407 783325 Leave her alone!
783492 785160 -Stop hurting her, please!<br />-Leave her alone!
797214 798173 Dad, look.
798340 799716 What now?
800843 801969 Move her!
804847 807558 Whoa, we got a baby in here.
813856 814690 She had a baby!
814857 817025 Baby!<br />Notify the press!
817192 818193 "The Medici Brothers...
818360 822614 "proudly present America's newest,<br />precious bundle of joy!"
824575 825742 Look at that.
827286 828203 It's okay now.
829705 831498 Don't be scared.
833959 837588 Don't be scared now,<br />your momma's right outside.
868702 870495 Baby! We got a baby!
870662 872122 We got a baby!
877586 878837 What is that?
879004 880047 Baby Jumbo.
882090 884218 I already got fake freaks in the freak show!
884384 886512 I don't need a real one in the center ring!
886678 889181 Rongo!<br />We've been swindled!
890098 891767 Gone and bought yourself a baby monster.
891934 893727 Think he can hear me?
895646 896647 Boo!
914581 917209 Rongo! Telegram to Brugelbecker.
917376 919127 "We have been bilked with damaged goods.
919294 922631 "This is an aberration, travestation...
922798 924299 "and I demand my money back."
924466 927094 But whatever you do, do not call the papers.
927261 929638 We are not advertising this baby.
931431 932474 Tell me you didn't do it.
933350 934643 You did it?
935352 939481 Never do anything I tell ya<br />without checking with me first!
944278 946238 Why me? Why me?
946947 948907 A face only a mother could love.
949074 949992 Sir?
950158 952452 Many of us find you handsome.
952619 954496 I was talking about the elephant!
959251 961879 Look, she's drawing him a bath.
967634 969303 Need a vet to come to look at him, Max.
969469 971054 No, no witnesses!
971221 974808 We are going to be in Joplin for two weeks.<br />We promised them a beautiful baby!
974975 977144 You have until tomorrow night to fix that!
977311 978729 -Me?<br />-Yes, you!
978896 980022 This is my problem?
980189 981315 Yes.<br />You tend the elephants.
981481 983358 Make those ears disappear!
991658 993118 Don't look at me.
1001752 1003795 Look at him,<br />those giant ears weigh him down.
1007341 1008759 Hi, Baby Jumbo.
1008926 1010511 Welcome to the circus.
1010677 1013639 We're all family here.<br />No matter how small.
1014681 1016975 Aren't elephants afraid of mice?
1017142 1019645 Says who?<br />That's why we experiment.
1020479 1023023 Someone needs to keep him company<br />when he's not with his momma.
1034867 1036411 Look. Give him one.
1036578 1039122 If he can lift his ears out of the way.
1040707 1042835 No. You have to blow your ears<br />out of the way.
1043001 1044336 Like this.
1048799 1051718 Good luck with that.<br />Maybe you can teach him to juggle, too.
1052302 1053887 Baby Jumbo, look at me.
1054054 1055055 Do what I do.
1055222 1056515 Blow.
1064022 1067150 No, not the feather.<br />Your ears. Blow!
1067359 1069319 He thinks it's a game.
1070612 1072030 -Max, come here.<br />-What?
1072197 1073240 Watch this.
1074241 1077411 I ride out, I do some jumps,<br />then all of a sudden...
1077995 1078996 stampede!
1079621 1080455 Send 'em!
1082249 1083542 Get out of the way, Max!
1086795 1089006 I'm still working out the timing.
1094928 1096513 Let me have a turn.
1111111 1113614 Meanwhile,<br />for when you lead out the elephants...
1113780 1115949 I had the costume departments<br />make you up a little something.
1116116 1117034 Okay.
1118660 1119995 What in gosh...
1120162 1121830 You really broke the bank with this, Max.
1121997 1123373 A lot of kids come to the show.
1123540 1125125 You don't want me to scare anyone,<br />I get it.
1125292 1126210 Dad, Dad!
1126376 1127836 It's Baby Jumbo. Come see.
1128003 1129755 He jumped in the air. With his ears.
1129922 1131340 Guys, I said leave him be.
1131507 1132549 But he was this far off the ground!
1132716 1133717 Yeah, I bet he was.
1133884 1135469 He'll be tripping all over<br />with ears like that.
1135928 1137596 Dad, really. We tried an experiment.
1137804 1139473 Just leave the poor guy alone.
1143894 1146605 First rule of science,<br />you have to have interest.
1146772 1149149 Otherwise, you don't deserve to know.
1151193 1153278 It's been a rough year for both of them.
1154238 1156031 Annie knew how to talk to 'em.
1161286 1165249 Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,<br />step right up.
1165415 1167626 Hurry, hurry. Come see the circus today.
1172381 1176218 "To be or not to be...
1176718 1179012 "that is the question.
1179221 1182933 "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br />the slings and arrows of outrageous..."
1201076 1202119 That ain't no snake.
1202286 1203412 Heck, I could do it.
1203912 1205414 As you wish.
1206164 1207207 Get out of here!
1208500 1210169 Rongo, let's go!
1213547 1216300 Hey, get away from the baby elephant!
1238947 1241992 Welcome, Joplin, Missouri!
1242159 1244077 Ladies and gentlemen...
1244244 1249333 I am your Master of Ceremonies,<br />Maximilian Medici.
1250626 1253587 And now, I give to you...
1253754 1256173 the Medici Brothers' circus.
1264598 1265599 Okay.
1265766 1267476 Okay, okay, no one's gonna hurt him.
1267643 1269561 Okay, little guy, let's put on a show.
1296839 1299925 Hey, ain't that Holt Farrier,<br />the Stallion Star?
1300676 1301510 Hey!
1301677 1302928 Ain't you Holt Farrier?
1304179 1306557 Nah, he died in the war.<br />So sad.
1321780 1322948 What's he doing?
1329538 1331456 He's reaching for the feathers.
1340048 1341884 Coat, coat, coat, coat!
1359985 1362404 What'd you do to that thing?<br />That ain't a real elephant.
1362571 1364114 Those ears are fake!
1364281 1365866 Look! Look at the sign!
1366033 1367117 "Dumbo!"
1377085 1378253 Calm down, now.
1382549 1383884 He's a fake!
1384051 1385344 Yeah, he's a fake!
1385511 1386512 Shut up!
1386887 1388222 You're scaring the elephants!
1390182 1391850 Take it easy now. Calm down.
1392017 1393852 Dumbo, Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!
1395854 1396772 All right, sit down.
1396939 1399149 -Dumbo, Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!<br />-I said sit down!
1400192 1401360 It's okay, little fella.
1403028 1404154 Fake!
1405989 1407616 Rongo! Music!
1407783 1409868 Happiness, joy!
1417459 1420254 Hear 'em making fun of your ugly baby?
1420921 1422840 Who's gonna help him now?
1425133 1428470 Holt, get those ears off the stage!
1437396 1439106 Okay, all right.
1439273 1440482 Okay, nobody's gonna hurt your baby.
1440649 1442150 Just calm down.
1443443 1445571 Okay. Attagirl.
1445737 1447489 We're here to protect him. Same as you.
1448824 1450200 Attagirl.
1450826 1451994 Nice and easy.
1456707 1458083 Okay, nobody's gonna hurt your baby.
1460502 1461712 Rufus, no!
1463547 1465090 -Rufus, stop!<br />-Mad elephant!
1465257 1466300 Get back!
1472598 1474224 Max, get the kids out of here!
1474391 1476185 Everybody, out!<br />Get to safety.
1476351 1477728 Careful, careful.
1484860 1486153 Kids?
1486320 1487446 Go, go, go!
1487613 1488614 Quick, quick, quick.<br />Go, go, go.
1488780 1489823 Come on, this way.
1491533 1494286 How do you like your job now, cowboy?
1501877 1503670 Milly, Joe!<br />Come on!
1505547 1506924 Let's go!<br />Come on!
1540165 1543293 And I wanna just emphasize,<br />we did everything right.
1543460 1546713 What it is, the tent just absolutely<br />fell down. It just collapsed.
1546880 1549091 And we had no way of knowing<br />what was gonna happen.
1676009 1679721 Brugelbecker, I have a man dead,<br />do you understand?
1679888 1683058 This is what they're reading<br />from the Great Lakes to the Gulf!
1683267 1686562 You have a moral responsibility<br />to buy your killer elephant back.
1687271 1688605 What about the baby?
1689898 1692484 Well, at least he got a few laughs.
1692651 1696321 I'll put him in the clown act,<br />see if I can salvage something.
1698490 1700117 I'll buy her back half price.
1701743 1704162 You will buy her back full price.
1704329 1705581 Quarter price.
1705747 1708000 Half price it is!
1713589 1714798 Up!
1717926 1719845 What's happening?<br />Where are they taking her?
1720012 1721180 Away. Back to your tent now.
1721346 1722806 But she's his mom!
1722973 1724766 Dad, please. Stop them.
1724933 1726101 Please!
1726268 1727728 Do something.
1727895 1729438 Mom would have done something.
1730230 1731815 Momma's not here.
1736862 1738989 Okay, little fella. Okay. Come on.
1742659 1743660 I know, I do.
1745204 1749082 Beautiful creature,<br />we'll take care of your son.
1831039 1832457 Darlin', it's late.
1833709 1835294 Go on now.
1888096 1891141 I know. I can't sleep, either.
1892142 1896939 My momma told me there'd be times<br />when my life seemed locked behind a door.
1898815 1903820 So, she gave me this key,<br />that her momma gave her.
1905072 1910410 And said whenever I have that feeling,<br />imagine that door...
1910786 1911954 and just turn the key.
1914831 1916750 So, I keep trying.
1924758 1926468 Not supposed to be in here alone.
1926969 1928887 I'm not. You're here.
1929054 1930222 What's that?
1930389 1932516 I just thought he might be hungry.
1933016 1934518 He's sad.
1935644 1936979 You don't eat when you're sad.
1937145 1938605 The mermaid does.
1940440 1941775 Come on.
1941942 1944194 Have one, Dumbo.
1944653 1946029 We're calling him Dumbo now?
1946738 1948824 If we call him Jumbo Junior...
1948991 1951368 it might make him miss his mom.
1956790 1959793 Here you go... Dumbo.
1960878 1963422 Come on, and flap those ears again.
1963589 1965799 To show us we didn't imagine it.
1970179 1973348 Your momma,<br />she didn't mean to hurt anyone.
1974308 1976351 She was just protecting you.
1976518 1979104 And we think your ears are great.
1983817 1985986 Maybe he wants to be alone.<br />Like Dad.
1986820 1988864 Nobody wants to be alone.
1989781 1990782 Well...
1992492 1994286 if you change your mind...
1997331 1998832 Night-night, Dumbo.
2028737 2029780 Wow!
2033825 2035827 It's not the peanuts that made him do it.
2035994 2037246 It's the feathers!
2044169 2045170 Dumbo!
2075742 2077828 Dumbo, you gotta do this in the show.
2077995 2078996 What do you mean?
2079621 2082206 'Cause if the circus sells more tickets<br />and Medici makes more money...
2082373 2084501 then we can get him to use some<br />to buy Mrs. Jumbo back.
2084668 2085710 Yeah!
2085878 2088172 We can get her back, Dumbo.<br />You can.
2088338 2089965 Just show them all what you can do.
2090132 2091466 Come on. We gotta tell Dad.
2091632 2094303 No. He'll just tell us to be practical.
2094469 2096263 Shows got canceled for a week, right?
2096429 2098515 We can research and study and test.
2100392 2103061 You're a miracle elephant, Dumbo.
2103228 2105439 And we're gonna bring your momma home.
2108483 2110152 Fire!
2131465 2132549 So low.
2132966 2134468 An all-time low.
2134635 2136386 Who said he didn't want to be recognized?
2138514 2141558 Okay, Big D, this is it.<br />Just like in rehearsal.
2141725 2143560 Except for lights, music, fire and crowds.
2143727 2144520 You can do it.
2144686 2145687 Come on, Dumbo.
2147523 2148524 You can do it, Dumbo!
2148690 2149942 Show 'em all like you showed us!
2154530 2156448 -Come! Come! Come!<br />-Attaboy, come on.
2157199 2159076 Keep comin'. Come on.
2165332 2167000 Go on now, Dumbo!<br />Come on.
2174967 2176635 Hey! Hey!
2198323 2200200 They love it! They love it!
2204496 2205539 All right, Dumbo.
2205706 2206999 You put out the fire.
2225184 2226602 He won't fly. He's scared.
2226768 2228478 I know.<br />Now, he's up too high.
2235736 2236737 Go on, Dumbo!
2251960 2253045 Attaboy.
2255464 2257633 Yeah! Rule Number One.
2257799 2259468 "Always have a big finish!"
2268810 2270687 Okay, guys.<br />Bring him down.
2271939 2272981 Yeah!
2284451 2285285 Holt!
2286078 2287496 -Look, Max!<br />-What? What?
2287663 2289414 -He's trapped up there.<br />-Put the fire out!
2291917 2293085 Dumbo! Fly!
2293252 2295045 He won't fly without a feather!
2299508 2301552 Put the fire out!
2301969 2302803 Put it out!
2304179 2305430 -Joe!<br />-Stop!
2307140 2309977 Holt, I thought she didn't want to be<br />in an act.
2312938 2314106 Milly!
2330998 2332082 Here, Dumbo!
2333250 2334251 Come on.
2334918 2335919 Show 'em.
2337671 2338922 Come on, Dumbo.
2366200 2367075 Fly, Dumbo.
2367242 2368160 Fly!
2385177 2386261 Yeah!
2421672 2423298 You knew he could do this?
2423465 2425342 You should talk to your kids more.
2436311 2437312 Sotheby...
2437479 2438897 cancel my dinner with the president.
2439565 2441900 We've got business with an elephant.
2445279 2449867 Friends, the next available shows<br />are in Arkansas!
2450868 2452369 Happy clowns!
2457374 2459751 -Rongo the Strong!<br />-Boss.
2460419 2461670 Hello, Jo!
2461837 2464131 The Medici Brothers' circus.
2464298 2468260 Where true love and mystery abound!
2469553 2471847 Now where's my star?
2472890 2474266 Dumbo!
2474433 2475475 How's your bath?
2475642 2477519 Too warm? Too cold?
2477686 2480772 Ladies, make sure his wrinkles<br />don't get wrinkles.
2480939 2485527 In our country, legend tells us<br />the gods can take animal forms.
2486153 2487696 Champagne for Dumbo!
2487863 2489364 No booze near the baby!
2511970 2513180 Sorry, Dumbo.
2514515 2515599 It's not your momma.
2515766 2517434 Take Dumbo back inside.
2527986 2530948 Ladies and gentlemen, please make way<br />for the emperor of enchantment.
2531114 2532449 For the architect of dreams.
2532616 2534535 For the Columbus of Coney Island.
2534701 2537079 Mr. V.A. Vandevere!
2540624 2544044 And traveling with him,<br />his bright shining star.
2544211 2547506 Colette Marchant,<br />the Queen of the Heavens!
2547673 2549299 Miss Marchant! Miss Marchant!
2554763 2556306 Signore Medici!
2557099 2558517 He knows who I am.
2558684 2560227 We were just passing through Missouri...
2560394 2562312 and we heard you were putting on<br />a little show.
2562479 2565482 Mr. Vandevere. It's an honor.
2565899 2569027 No, sir. The honor is mine.
2571613 2572990 I would like to offer you a drink.
2573740 2575826 But I'm all out of bourbon.
2577411 2579621 And cognac and scotch.
2585752 2587087 Not now!
2589756 2591508 Is that a monkey in your desk?
2592426 2593635 Just for emergencies.
2593802 2596054 Look, Mr. Vandevere...
2596221 2597764 I probably should tell you...
2597931 2600225 the elephant is not for sale.
2600392 2602895 Dumbo will only fly for the Medici circus.
2603061 2605439 That's assuming he is real.
2612529 2613739 See for yourself.
2613906 2616283 And all due respect, I don't got all day.
2616450 2617868 -Pleasure to meet you...<br />-Excuse me.
2619036 2620120 Hello there.
2628462 2630255 So this creature of yours...
2630422 2632049 is supposed to fly?
2633550 2634968 Trade secrets.
2644770 2647689 Max, if you don't mind my asking...
2647856 2652152 where did you come upon the animal?
2652319 2654488 He hails from the far east.
2654655 2655656 How far?
2655822 2657282 Far.
2657449 2658992 He doesn't look like "magic" to me.
2660911 2662871 Well, what the heck can you tell<br />by appearances, right?
2663205 2665749 And you train flying elephants, too?
2665916 2668001 Yeah, it's a little hobby on the side.
2670712 2672422 It's the kids taught Dumbo.
2675050 2676927 Ah, yes.
2680472 2681598 Yeah?
2681765 2684309 And how on earth did you do that?
2685227 2686645 With the scientific method.
2688605 2690732 One picture, one picture!
2690899 2691859 Max.
2692776 2695362 You possess something<br />that's very rare in life.
2695529 2699992 And the tragedy of it is,<br />is you don't even know that you have it.
2701034 2703620 Do you know what it is that you have, Max?
2703787 2704705 No.
2704872 2706456 It's mystique.
2707541 2710002 Max, I know your type.
2710169 2712546 Charlatan, con man, opportunist...
2712713 2715549 New York is that way,<br />in case you need directions.
2715716 2719928 And I know it comes from a deep desire<br />to build something authentic and true.
2720095 2721722 I know your game.
2721889 2723056 It's not a game.
2723223 2726685 Some men cheat the rules,<br />others change them.
2727853 2729146 It's up your sleeve.
2730355 2732191 It's in your pocket.
2739489 2742576 The secret to show business<br />is always keep a rabbit in your hat.
2742743 2745245 Or a monkey in your desk, I guess.
2746830 2748290 Ownership shares?
2748457 2751919 Max, look around you.<br />Your entire way of life is dying.
2752085 2755422 The future of the entertainment business<br />is to bring the audience to you.
2755589 2757257 And I've built that destination.
2757424 2759801 What I'm lacking...
2759968 2761553 is a protégé.
2765224 2768352 I know there's no Medici Brothers.
2769561 2772439 You probably always wanted one.
2773690 2775025 You're offering me a partnership?
2775192 2776193 Yes.
2776360 2778111 And a home.
2778278 2779863 For you and the entire troupe.
2780155 2783158 A home?<br />For all of us?
2783325 2785661 Yes. Join me.
2785827 2787704 Join me and my family.
2787871 2790415 Let me take us all into the future.
2790582 2793585 Let me take us all...
2793752 2795504 to Dreamland!
2838547 2840090 I wish Momma could've seen this.
2841175 2843552 Well, somehow,<br />I think she knows we're here.
2849099 2851226 Way to work your magic, Max.
2861820 2863280 We hear you, Dumbo!
2864364 2865991 Why won't you let him see outside?
2866158 2868118 Remember, young lady...
2868285 2869578 mystique.
2873707 2876418 Now this is why I joined the circus.
2879630 2881757 Dad.<br />Wonders of Science!
2882216 2884635 All right, sugar plum.<br />Remember, we got a job to do here.
2884801 2887513 My daughter, she fancies herself<br />the next Marie Curie.
2888222 2891725 Don't ever let anybody tell you<br />what you can't do.
2891892 2894436 Hang on, I wasn't saying she can't.
2894603 2898524 What is it exactly that we do here,<br />ma chérie?
2898982 2901777 We make the impossible possible.
2907741 2909243 And that's where you'll perform.
2909409 2910452 The Colosseum!
2910619 2913038 Dumbo will stay in the training tent behind.
2913664 2914706 Dumbo!
2920254 2921797 Why aren't we going with him?
2921964 2925759 Because that is your new home.
2931265 2932349 Wow!
2933559 2935185 Look at this place!
2935352 2936645 A library...
2936812 2938689 "And the children shall lead them."
2938856 2940732 We're grateful for the opportunity,<br />Mr. Vandevere.
2940899 2943193 Your family's mine.
2946196 2949825 You know, I've been brushing up<br />on your story, Mr. Farrier.
2949992 2951952 Kentucky's top trick rider.
2952119 2953537 Well, there's no reason<br />you can't be again...
2953704 2956623 only here, you'd be Captain Farrier...
2956790 2957916 war hero.
2960669 2961670 One-armed wonder.
2961837 2963213 National treasure.
2963964 2964923 Wow!
2965090 2966550 Well, I still can ride.
2966717 2967801 Oh, I know you can.
2967968 2969428 And you're going to.
2970179 2972973 Right after you get that little elephant<br />off the ground for me.
2973265 2974725 You mean once his act's working?
2974892 2976435 You're back in the saddle.
2976852 2979521 We're still working on the schedule<br />for the rest of your troupe...
2979688 2981565 but on Friday...
2981732 2983442 we premiere our little Dumbo.
2985944 2987946 I get goose bumps.
2990365 2991825 Why are you looking at me?
2992659 2997039 Well, because the only thing more amazing<br />than a flying elephant...
2997623 2999082 is the goddess who can fly it.
3000751 3002794 Have you lost your mind?
3005714 3008759 Let's not forget from<br />whence we came, darling.
3011178 3012763 So, we fly Friday!
3013764 3016391 Dumbo's never flown with anyone.
3017017 3021980 That's why it's become abundantly clear<br />why we need you.
3023106 3024608 Dumbo!
3028695 3030531 -Hey, buddy.<br />-We missed you. You all right?
3030697 3033408 Hey. Captain Farrier is in charge.
3033575 3035410 No one sees the animal without his approval.
3035911 3036828 Holt.
3036995 3038455 Just call me Holt.
3039831 3041750 I thought you were a military man.
3041917 3044086 Nice boots you bagged there.<br />What are they, shark skin?
3045295 3046588 No.
3047130 3049967 So you better keep your elephant friend<br />on my good side.
3055305 3056306 Hiya, Dumbo.
3063438 3065315 Dumbo, you mind?
3065482 3066650 Can I get my arm?
3068360 3070320 And these are the hands<br />I'll be putting my life in?
3070988 3072114 Welcome.
3072823 3075200 For the record, this was not my idea.
3075367 3076869 Dumbo works alone.
3077035 3078495 So do I.
3080372 3081790 Bonjour, Milly, Joe...
3083292 3084543 And you...
3088130 3089548 Charming.
3089715 3092593 Well, maybe he doesn't recognize you<br />without your makeup.
3093385 3095053 So I gotta teach you to fly?
3095220 3098974 I know how to fly, ever since I was a child.
3099641 3101852 They taught Dumbo to fly, no?
3102019 3103729 So I don't need your expertise.
3105397 3106398 All right.
3107816 3110027 Well, just so you know, I've been to France.
3110360 3111987 It wasn't a good experience.
3112154 3113864 Show me your secret!
3114031 3115908 How on earth does your elephant fly?
3116074 3118368 Well, first,<br />he needs a feather.
3119536 3121205 He won't fly without a feather.
3122414 3125417 Well then, neither will I.
3153278 3154947 Whoa, slow down, princess. Safety first.
3155113 3156073 Guys, nets.
3156240 3157491 Come on, hurry.
3160661 3162412 All right, guys, good.
3171338 3172965 See, Dumbo?
3174091 3176218 I fly!
3184560 3186270 See if you can catch me!
3189273 3190566 Here, Dumbo!
3251001 3253295 We got some work to do.
3262930 3263972 Friends and colleagues...
3264139 3266892 let's give a warm Dreamland welcome<br />to our new executive vice president...
3267059 3268060 Mr. Max Medici.
3270896 3272856 Anything he needs, anything at all...
3273023 3274983 make it happen as you always do.
3279738 3281198 This is Miss Verna.
3281365 3285160 She will handle your schedule,<br />correspondence, and all your calls.
3285327 3288038 When you're needed in meetings,<br />she'll let you know.
3288539 3289790 Are there meetings today?
3289957 3291583 I'll let you know!
3294002 3295754 Mr. Vandevere, one question.
3295921 3298131 Exactly what do I do?
3302344 3304513 So where'd Vandevere find you?
3306390 3308225 I was a street performer in Paris.
3309685 3311103 He discovered me.
3311478 3312980 And here I am.
3315399 3316859 A millionaire's girlfriend.
3317025 3318318 That's a tough break.
3319945 3321196 It's all for show.
3321989 3324408 So you and he, you're not...
3324575 3327870 I'm one of many gems he wears<br />to reflect the light back onto him.
3331790 3332875 Good boy, Dumbo.
3333041 3335294 -Good job.<br />-Yeah! They're gonna love him.
3335460 3337171 I think you are the lucky one.
3339506 3341091 -Well done, Dumbo.<br />-Good boy.
3341258 3344553 Who's been dreaming<br />like I've been dreaming?
3346054 3348307 So, how's everything?
3348473 3350309 -Good?<br />-We're making progress.
3350475 3351894 But he ain't quite ready yet.
3352060 3354605 What's the problem?<br />Doesn't the animal trust you?
3354771 3357149 -It's not that simple.<br />-Ma chérie...
3357316 3360694 we've already sold all the tickets.
3360861 3364489 Maybe our little scientist here<br />can show us that it's going to work.
3377377 3378629 Prepare for takeoff.
3378795 3380047 -Right wing?<br />-Check!
3382049 3383050 Left wing?
3383217 3384343 Check!
3385052 3386637 Take her up, Dumbo.
3391058 3392476 Let's go.
3392643 3394436 -Come on, buddy. Come on.<br />-Come on, Dumbo.
3396313 3398190 That's it.<br />Come on.
3404780 3406323 Let's try it again.
3407699 3409535 You got this.<br />Here you go.
3424299 3426552 You beautiful one-armed cowboy.
3427845 3430138 You've made me a child again.
3441942 3444778 Welcome to the Colosseum...
3444945 3447447 where the impossible is possible.
3490782 3493452 Buonasera. Max Medici.
3494328 3496580 I discovered the elephant, my elephant.
3496747 3499541 And basically I said no.<br />I walked out and that was the end of that.
3499708 3501126 The flying elephant's mine.
3501293 3502127 Yeah.
3503378 3505005 You're the guy!
3505172 3507257 You're the guy that's made out of magic dust!
3507925 3509092 Max.
3509259 3511595 J. Griffin Remington. Atlas Forge Bank.
3511762 3513847 He's the money man.
3514014 3515015 The J?
3516225 3518101 It's a pleasure to meet you.
3518268 3519269 How are you?
3519436 3521271 You know, they say<br />the moon is made out of magic dust.
3521438 3524233 That's why they're going to send<br />a man up there one of these days.
3524399 3528529 And my bank is going to be the bank<br />that finances the expedition.
3529029 3530364 What do you think of that?
3531698 3533033 Needless to say, Max...
3533200 3534868 we all have high hopes for tonight.
3535035 3537704 Oh, yeah. High hopes.<br />High hopes.
3537871 3541124 Well, you know, hopes, and dreams,<br />that's one thing. That's words.
3541291 3543335 But what we're talking about here is facts!
3543502 3544586 Plans!
3544753 3547005 Plans! That takes a lot of money.
3547172 3548549 Which he hasn't got!
3548715 3552135 So, we are hoping that your pachyderm<br />comes through with the goods.
3552302 3555097 Now let's get this show on the road!
3561854 3563397 We are looking good!
3564773 3565899 Don't worry, Big D.
3566066 3568277 There's just more room to fly out there,<br />that's all.
3568443 3570195 Round and round, just like we practiced.
3570821 3573156 And then Dad can talk to Vandevere<br />about the deal!
3573323 3574491 About the what?
3574658 3575742 We made a deal with Dumbo.
3575909 3578745 We promised we'd buy his mom back<br />with all the money he makes for the circus.
3578912 3580122 That's why he flies.
3581331 3583000 -Joe, not now!<br />-Are we ready?
3584126 3585085 Yeah.
3591466 3593510 Okay, let's go.
3593677 3595679 Okay, Dumbo, let's do this.
3654863 3656615 Pink elephants?
3656782 3658033 So?
3717134 3721930 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />boys and girls of all ages!
3722097 3726059 This is the moment<br />we've all been waiting for!
3726226 3730480 V.A. Vandevere,<br />in association with Max Medici...
3730647 3735068 proudly presents,<br />making his Dreamland debut...
3735235 3737446 You've seen a horse-fly.
3737613 3740032 You've seen a dragonfly.
3740199 3742701 You've even seen a housefly.
3743160 3745204 But you haven't seen anything...
3745370 3749082 until you see an elephant fly.
3749249 3752169 Let's get ready for Dumbo!
3769478 3770979 Coming through.
3772356 3773524 Come on.
3792334 3793544 He can do it.
3796046 3797339 I know he can.
3802052 3804263 And here to welcome him...
3804429 3809184 our own Queen of the Heavens!
3860152 3861778 Dumbo.
3863071 3866450 Five times around the ring.<br />That's all we have to do.
3867659 3868994 Nice and easy, like we practiced.
3875751 3876752 Dad?
3877419 3878462 Why aren't they putting up the nets?
3881590 3883008 Hey, guys?
3883175 3885260 Guys, what's going on?<br />Your men are supposed to be out there!
3885427 3886595 Change of plan. From the top.
3897648 3899441 I can't see the nets.
3900317 3902027 They're invisible.
3904071 3905906 What's wrong with you? They need nets!
3908116 3908951 Colette!
3909117 3910702 Wait, don't take off!
3912371 3913497 Dumbo...
3913664 3914623 Oh, boy!
3914790 3916375 ...Prince of the Elephants.
3918252 3921129 I command you to fly with me.
3952119 3953287 Colette!
3969386 3970804 Lower the platform!
3989823 3991158 Fly, little one!
4010677 4012346 Magic dust!
4040249 4041458 Where's my show?
4064273 4066358 The elephant's headed to Nightmare Island.
4086920 4088922 Come on, sweetie. Let's go.
4125876 4126877 Dumbo, it's okay.
4127044 4128170 We're here.
4129962 4131089 Good evening.
4131256 4132090 It's Mr. Vandevere.
4132256 4133509 -Hello, hi.<br />-Hey, that's V.A. Vandevere!
4133675 4134926 Everyone having fun?
4135469 4136636 Good.
4136803 4137888 -Having a good time?<br />-Yes, sir.
4139055 4140182 Fantastic.
4140557 4142184 Get him outta here.
4142850 4144185 -Yes.<br />-Over here!
4144353 4145604 -Folks, please.<br />-Hello.
4145770 4147439 Folks, I need you to leave the exhibit.
4148398 4149566 Come on.
4151443 4153069 Guys, guys, go easy,<br />he's just a baby.
4153237 4155572 Soldier, I give the orders here.
4163372 4164790 It's his bedtime.
4167167 4168919 This attraction is now closed.
4176260 4177261 Dad?
4179763 4181473 It's Mrs. Jumbo.
4187312 4190357 -Come on, I want to see Dumbo!<br />-I want to see Dumbo!
4190524 4191733 I want my money back!
4191899 4193151 I don't understand.
4193318 4194945 The elephant flies. You saw it.
4195445 4197072 I saw a vanishing act.
4197322 4200492 I'm not investing one cent<br />until I can see this works.
4200659 4202870 You can't control your animal.
4203036 4205289 You give me a little time, I can fix this.
4205455 4208625 Whatever! Till then, the bank is closed.
4213213 4215382 What happened up there?<br />You lost control of the animal.
4215549 4216550 You're the animal.
4216717 4217885 Where was my net?
4218051 4220304 Nets are for rehearsal.<br />This is the show.
4223223 4225309 Training?<br />You call that training?
4225475 4228020 Now, hold on, Mr. Vandevere,<br />we know why he flew away.
4228187 4229938 He recognized that other elephant's call.
4230105 4232024 The one on Nightmare Island.<br />It's his momma!
4232191 4233317 It's true. It's her.
4233483 4235110 She was sold from our circus two months ago.
4235277 4236528 Every child knows its mother.
4236695 4239281 And they say elephants never forget.
4239448 4240866 They can be together now.
4241408 4243076 Why are there children in my office?
4243243 4247039 Mr. Vandevere, please,<br />all Dumbo wants is his momma.
4247206 4249833 Just reunite them,<br />and he'll do whatever you want.
4250000 4252628 No, he'll do whatever she wants.
4253045 4256757 You think I'd have bought her if I thought<br />she was related to him?
4258050 4259676 Doesn't help me at all.
4264306 4267142 You wanna know the most important thing<br />about growing up?
4268727 4273023 You've got to learn to go it alone.
4276068 4278445 Get rid of the mother.<br />You know where to take her.
4278612 4280030 And treat yourself to some new boots.
4280447 4282366 But, sir, you can't just kill her.
4282950 4283992 Why not?
4284159 4285327 Mr. Vandevere.
4285494 4287663 Wait!<br />Don't separate 'em, please.
4287829 4289706 Don't do that to my kids.
4289873 4293669 You know, Holt, when my father left us,<br />it was a blessing really.
4293836 4296713 Because I had to learn<br />how to fend for myself.
4296880 4298841 Maybe that's what your children need.
4299341 4300425 Don't tell me what my children need.
4300592 4302344 Best take a step back, Elephant Man.
4304471 4306014 Darling...
4306181 4310269 Dumbo and his mom need a little alone time.
4310435 4312604 So, Mommy's going to take a little trip...
4312771 4314940 so that Dumbo won't be distracted.
4317568 4318443 Milly!
4318610 4320195 Milly!
4333166 4334251 Colette?
4335961 4337337 I have rehearsal.
4338881 4339923 Max.
4345429 4346471 Nightmare Island.
4346638 4347639 Milly?
4347806 4350142 Home of the most dangerous beasts<br />in the world.
4350309 4351894 Sir, park's closing.
4359109 4360235 Milly!
4364239 4365240 Milly!
4370412 4372164 Did you find her?
4372873 4373916 No.
4376919 4380839 Well, her momma always knew what to say.<br />No matter what.
4381006 4382257 She always knew.
4383217 4386136 Your children don't need you to be perfect.
4386595 4388931 They just need you to believe in them.
4390516 4392100 That simple, huh?
4398440 4401735 All right, well,<br />I'm gonna keep looking.
4422714 4425342 That's my daughter all right.
4425509 4428470 The only girl I know<br />who runs away to go to school.
4429680 4431306 It's our fault.
4431473 4433767 Bet Dumbo wishes he never met us.
4433934 4436353 You showed him he could fly.
4436520 4438438 You think he'd ever trade that?
4439314 4441358 He would to have his mom back.
4446738 4448282 I miss Momma.
4450158 4451827 Yeah, so do I.
4455581 4457583 There's something I want to show you.
4458917 4461712 With advances in both<br />engineering and medicine...
4461879 4464381 the human and the mechanical<br />will soon be combined...
4464548 4467718 to assist ordinary families, workers<br />and veterans.
4467885 4472890 All kinds of technological marvels<br />await us in the 20th century.
4473515 4475726 You're gonna do great things.
4476977 4477978 I know it.
4488864 4490157 What's this?
4490324 4491491 Give me a break.
4491658 4494745 I gotta teach you how to read English, too?
4499958 4501710 Oh, Max, hello!
4502878 4504796 Good, you brought the paperwork.
4504963 4506006 Max...
4507007 4509259 I was reviewing your troupe...
4509760 4510761 and to be honest with you...
4510928 4514139 they're really pale imitations<br />from the acts we already have.
4514306 4517559 So I was thinking, I don't know,<br />a month's severance? Seems fair.
4517726 4519144 Capisce?
4520562 4522356 I thought you promised to...
4522523 4525275 Max, the contract says that I'd hire them.
4525442 4527277 It never stipulated for how long.
4527444 4530447 So, get your little band of low-rent freaks<br />out of here.
4530614 4533909 But they're my troupe.<br />They're countin' on me.
4534076 4536411 Okay, let's have a heart.
4536578 4538413 Why don't you tell them?
4549967 4553387 ‘Bout time, boss.<br />So, when do we start?
4564439 4565899 What's going on, guys?
4566066 4567943 Vandevere's fired them all.
4568110 4570195 They're to leave by tomorrow.
4582875 4585210 Goodbye, little friend.
4585836 4587421 Goodbye.
4589673 4592426 We wanted to see him one last time.
4592593 4594970 One last time to see him fly.
4596096 4597890 I don't think he wants to anymore.
4598515 4600350 Oh, no. But he must.
4600517 4603103 He cannot lose Mrs. Jumbo again!
4603270 4606148 I'm afraid it's rather worse than that.
4606607 4607733 Mr. Sotheby?
4608275 4610277 I've come to clear my conscience.
4611195 4613864 I resigned my position as soon<br />as I heard him give the order.
4614031 4615449 What order?
4616408 4619328 Mrs. Jumbo will be gone by tomorrow night.
4619494 4621330 And she's not meant to survive.
4637054 4639139 This "Dreamland" doesn't deserve him.
4639640 4641558 No circus does.
4653487 4657824 Well, who's gonna be willing to help me?
4660160 4662496 Set Dumbo and his momma free.
4690732 4695696 Welcome to the Colosseum,<br />where the impossible is possible.
4697990 4700617 Okay. Second time's the charm.
4700784 4704121 Let's see if Dream Daddy's<br />worked out the kinks.
4704288 4706164 Here to pick up the elephant<br />from Nightmare Island?
4706331 4707249 Confirmed.
4707416 4709042 Unlock the back gates.
4732065 4733609 Dumbo in position!
4734860 4737863 Soon as he flies, you run back to his tent<br />and I'll find you there.
4738155 4739364 All right, Big D.
4740824 4743035 It's all up to you now.
4744578 4745829 Come on, Holt!
4755881 4757382 To hell with it.
4761970 4763889 Ready for positions.
4764056 4766225 We could have used a little rehearsal.
4766391 4767726 Rehearsal?
4767893 4770395 Think we got a rehearsal<br />at the Battle of the Argonne?
4771396 4773190 You sure you can do this?
4773357 4775067 I fly elephants all the time.
4776235 4777945 Are you sure you can do this?
4778862 4780739 With one hand tied behind my back.
4793460 4795963 Wait. What's that?
4797422 4798549 Ma'am?
4800217 4801260 Ma'am?
4802177 4804096 Sorry, ma'am, attraction's closed.
4804263 4807391 My dream... to be a mermaid...
4807558 4809810 and now they've taken it away.
4809977 4812354 And yet I hear the water singing.
4812521 4813856 I hear them beckoning me home.
4814022 4815983 Lady, just be careful, okay?
4816149 4818360 -Return me to the vast abyss!<br />-Let's go.
4818527 4820904 -My destiny, the sea!<br />-Okay.
4870329 4871496 We've lost power!
4871663 4872998 Even the cages?
4873165 4874625 But the animals...
4876293 4878128 Find the breakers. Get the lights back on!
4878754 4880589 And make sure those cages are locked.
4899233 4902361 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />boys and girls.
4902528 4905864 Making his second Dreamland debut.
4906114 4908909 Let's get ready for Dumbo!

5021939 5022940 You.
5023106 5025275 Where is your circus of freaks?
5027653 5028987 What's going on?
5029154 5031281 The elephant's mother is gone!
5031448 5033784 His troupe's behind it!
5034284 5036245 Alert the tower and secure the gates.
5036912 5038747 Don't let them get out.
5040290 5042084 But why would they only take the one?
5043460 5046380 Keep your eye on Farrier and those kids.
5046547 5048131 You! Come with us.
5062521 5063730 There they are!
5065774 5066859 Hey!
5076785 5078203 Hey, you!
5078370 5079663 What are you doing up there?
5079830 5081623 That's private property.
5081790 5083292 Come on! Get down here!
5083458 5084543 Now!
5084710 5087963 Hey, I'm Max Medici, Vandevere's partner.
5088255 5091800 He's just a maintenance man fixing a light!<br />Get back to your posts!
5091967 5093760 Yes, sir, Mr. Medici.
5108692 5110527 Let's try this again.
5110694 5112112 You and me.
5127628 5128837 Hey, the kids?
5129004 5130005 Where are the kids?
5130172 5131256 Hey, have you seen the kids?
5131423 5135427 Dumbo, Prince of the Elephants!
5135594 5138639 I command you to fly with me.
5153779 5156198 Dumbo, please fly.
5157157 5158784 Do it for your momma.
5213922 5215048 Where's your father?
5229271 5230105 Dumbo!
5242492 5244328 Hey! Get those kids!

5306306 5307558 Just passing through!
5309226 5310519 Hey! You can't do that!
5313397 5314898 Get the elephant!
5315065 5316191 You get the elephant!
5338130 5341300 Don't worry. Dad'll be here soon.
5341466 5342885 Where's the elephant?
5349224 5351810 Why are you just standing there?<br />Get to the tower!
5351977 5354313 Electricity's failing! There's no elevators!
5354479 5357065 When I last checked,<br />they invented stairs.
5358317 5361778 We seem to be experiencing<br />some technical difficulties.
5376335 5378795 What happened to my power?
5379796 5381465 What power, mon chéri?
5381632 5383133 You ungrateful...
5383300 5386553 You were nothing before I made you my...
5387095 5389681 I believe the word is "queen."
5391517 5393268 I need lights!
5396021 5397147 Mr. Vandevere, wait!
5397314 5399566 We have to reset the mains,<br />or you could cause a surge!
5399733 5400943 Right now it's impossible!
5401109 5403111 Nothing's impossible!
5405280 5406281 Mr. Vandevere!
5412621 5414164 Mr. Vandevere, stop!
5439773 5441525 Milly! Joe!
5450492 5452286 Come on. Go!<br />Come on!
5479104 5480105 Get everyone out!
5480272 5482274 Evacuate the park!
5486486 5487988 Milly! Joe!
5501335 5502336 Hey!
5508509 5510135 Where is the elephant?
5510302 5511553 Let her go!
5529071 5530072 Come on!
5530239 5531365 Milly! Joe!
5531532 5532783 Dad!
5532950 5534493 -You all right? All right?<br />-We're fine.
5534660 5536036 Okay, come on.<br />All right, cover your faces.
5536203 5538247 Give me your hand!<br />Come on!
5538413 5539081 Back!
5541416 5542668 Stay close.
5551885 5553095 Come on, everybody.
5553262 5555389 Let's get to the seaport!<br />Now!
5555889 5558058 -Where are the Farriers?<br />-They must still be inside.
5590799 5591717 Dad!
5592676 5593844 It's okay, Joe.
5595637 5596680 Come here. Come here.
5599516 5600559 Dumbo!
5608734 5609610 Dumbo!
5609776 5610861 Come on!
5611612 5613906 -Go! Go! Go! Go!<br />-Jump!
5614364 5615866 Come on. Come on.
5623957 5625459 -All right, let's go.<br />-Stay close, come on.
5628462 5629630 Okay. Go! Go! Go!
5629796 5631215 Come on!
5632090 5633300 -Dumbo!<br />-Come on!
5634301 5635511 Dumbo! What's wrong?
5635677 5637554 Guys! Milly! Joe! Come on!
5637721 5638889 Dumbo, let's go!
5643060 5644061 Go!
5649233 5650651 Dumbo!
5650817 5652528 Get him!
5652694 5654821 He's seen us.<br />Dumbo, you gotta go.
5654988 5656365 They're comin' for you.<br />You gotta go, Dumbo.
5656532 5657616 He lost the feather.
5657783 5660536 Feather doesn't do nothin'.<br />Dumbo, you don't need the feather to fly.
5661078 5662621 Dad, they're coming!
5663372 5664831 Stand back! Stand back!
5664998 5665999 Out of my way!
5668210 5670128 Dumbo, remember this?
5670295 5672256 From my momma?
5672422 5676134 I can unlock any door.<br />And you can, too.
5677135 5678679 But I don't need this key to do it.
5678846 5680138 And you don't need the feather.
5681640 5682474 Come on.
5697865 5698782 Dad!
5698949 5700033 Gotta go. Come on!
5702119 5704204 -What are you doing?<br />-There ain't room for the three of us.
5704371 5706081 You get him to the seaport<br />and I'll see you there.
5706540 5707749 Go on, Big D.
5714131 5715257 Grab 'em!
5715424 5716425 Hey!

5748248 5749499 Hey! Get back here!
5752836 5754505 You freak!<br />What have you done?
5754922 5756215 What they pay me for, mister.
5756381 5757841 Put on a hell of a show.
5761428 5762638 Hey! Him!
5762804 5764848 Right there, arrest that man.<br />He stole my elephant.
5765015 5766767 Hey, we had a contract, Medici!
5767226 5770437 I'm no expert,<br />but I think you got bigger problems here.
5782241 5784451 Wow. This is a disaster.
5785577 5786954 Come on, I'll buy you a hot dog.
