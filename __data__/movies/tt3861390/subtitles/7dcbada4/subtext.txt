2595200 2596840 I probably should tell you...

2643800 2646680 VANDEVERE: Uh, Max,<br />if you don't mind my asking...
2646760 2651280 where did you<br />come upon the animal?
2651360 2653480 He hails from the far east.
2653560 2654800 How far?
2654880 2656280 Far.
2656360 2657960 He doesn't look<br />like "magic" to me.
2659320 2661880 Well, what the heck can you<br />tell by appearances, right?
2661960 2664880 And you train<br />flying elephants, too?
2664960 2666560 Yeah, it's a little hobby<br />on the side.
2669760 2671360 It's the kids taught Dumbo.
2673840 2675880 Ah, yes.
2679480 2680600 Yeah?
2680680 2683280 And how on earth<br />did you do that?

2691760 2694440 You possess something<br />that's very rare in life.
2694520 2697080 And the tragedy of it is,
2697160 2699000 is you don't even know<br />that you have it.
2700040 2702720 Do you know what it is<br />that you have, Max?
2702800 2703800 No.

2756400 2758880 What I'm lacking...
2758960 2761120 is a protégé.
2764240 2767360 I know<br />there's no Medici Brothers.
2768600 2771440 You probably always<br />wanted one.

2966880 2968440 And you're going to.
2969200 2970680 Right after you get<br />that little elephant
2970760 2971960 off the ground for me.
2972040 2973720 You mean<br />once his act's working?
2973800 2975440 You're back in the saddle.
2975520 2977440 We're still working<br />on the schedule

2985000 2986960 I get goose bumps.
2989360 2990800 Why are you looking at me?
2991640 2993400 Well, because the only thing
2993480 2996520 more amazing<br />than a flying elephant...
2996640 2998040 is the goddess who can fly it.
2999800 3001800 Have you lost your mind?

3004720 3007760 Let's not forget from<br />whence we came, darling.
3009840 3011760 So, we fly Friday!
3011840 3015360 Uh, Dumbo's never flown<br />with anyone.
3016000 3018880 That's why it's become<br />abundantly clear
3018960 3019960 why we need you.

3043160 3045280 (CHUCKLES) No.
3046160 3047440 So you better keep<br />your elephant friend
3047520 3048920 on my good side.
3054320 3055280 Hiya, Dumbo.
3062480 3064440 Dumbo, you mind?
3064520 3065640 Can I get my arm?
3067400 3069280 And these are the hands<br />I'll be putting my life in?
3070000 3071760 Welcome.
3071880 3074280 For the record,<br />this was not my idea.

3115080 3117320 Well, first,<br />he needs a feather.
