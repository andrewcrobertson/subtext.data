2696361 2698905 And the tragedy of it is,
2698989 2700824 is you don't even know<br />that you have it.
2701867 2704536 Do you know what it is<br />that you have, Max?

2971052 2972512 Right after you get<br />that little elephant
2972595 2973805 off the ground for me.
2973888 2975557 You mean<br />once his act's working?

2991197 2992615 Why are you looking at me?
2993491 2995243 Well, because the only thing
2995326 2998371 more amazing<br />than a flying elephant...
2998454 2999873 is the goddess who can fly it.
3001624 3003626 Have you lost your mind?
