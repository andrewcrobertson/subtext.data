2675674 2677717 Ah, yes.
2681304 2682430 Yeah?
2682514 2685100 And how on earth<br />did you do that?

2696361 2698905 And the tragedy of it is,
2698989 2700824 is you don't even know<br />that you have it.
2701867 2704536 Do you know what it is<br />that you have, Max?

2971052 2972512 Right after you get<br />that little elephant
2972595 2973805 off the ground for me.
2973888 2975557 You mean<br />once his act's working?
2975640 2977267 You're back in the saddle.

2991197 2992615 Why are you looking at me?
2993491 2995243 Well, because the only thing
2995326 2998371 more amazing<br />than a flying elephant...
2998454 2999873 is the goddess who can fly it.
3001624 3003626 Have you lost your mind?

3013678 3017182 Uh, Dumbo's never flown<br />with anyone.
3017849 3020727 That's why it's become<br />abundantly clear

3045001 3047128 (CHUCKLES) No.
3048004 3049255 So you better keep<br />your elephant friend

3064312 3066272 Dumbo, you mind?
3066356 3067482 Can I get my arm?

3071819 3073613 Welcome.
3073696 3076115 For the record,<br />this was not my idea.
