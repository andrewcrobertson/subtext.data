499541 501084 He finally ran off<br />with the bearded lady.
501168 504213 I've been filling in with<br />roustabouts ever since.
505297 507382 I need somebody good<br />to tend the elephants.
507466 509426 No, you're not serious.
509510 510677 I am on occasion.
510761 512346 This is a big job<br />and you know it.

517601 520687 So you sold my horses<br />and kept your elephants.
520770 524024 Your scrawny, mangy,<br />cut-rate elephants.
524107 526401 They're important.<br />Especially this season.
527110 527945 Why's that?
528028 530155 I know it goes<br />against my nature...

546964 548590 But I swear to you, Holt,

555222 557349 Oh, no. She's not sick.
558350 559810 Any day now...
559893 562145 she's having a baby.

583959 585127 Toys?
585210 586920 They're not toys.
587004 588505 They're for<br />my science experiments.
588589 591175 Well, we're a circus, darlin',<br />a circus.
591258 593844 We need to be practical<br />if we want to survive.
593927 596555 You couldn't<br />just take up one act?

2558684 2560269 We were just<br />passing through Missouri...

2562396 2565440 Mr. Vandevere. It's an honor.
2566024 2568986 No, sir. The honor is mine.

2593844 2596138 Look, Mr. Vandevere...
2596221 2597848 I probably should tell you...
2597931 2600350 the elephant is not for sale.
2600434 2602895 Dumbo will only fly<br />for the Medici circus.
2602978 2605397 That's assuming he is real.
2612529 2613822 See for yourself.
2613906 2616283 And all due respect,<br />I don't got all day.
2616366 2617826 -Pleasure to meet you...<br />-Excuse me.
2619036 2620078 Hello there.
2628128 2630255 So this, uh,<br />creature of yours...
2630339 2632007 is supposed to fly?
2633550 2634927 Trade secrets.
2635052 2636136 (CHUCKLES)
2638722 2639806 Ugh.
2642768 2644603 (SNIFFING)
2644811 2647689 VANDEVERE: Uh, Max,<br />if you don't mind my asking...
2647773 2652277 where did you<br />come upon the animal?
2652361 2654488 He hails from the far east.
2654571 2655781 How far?
2655864 2657282 Far.
2657366 2658951 He doesn't look<br />like "magic" to me.
2660327 2662871 Well, what the heck can you<br />tell by appearances, right?
2662955 2665874 And you train<br />flying elephants, too?
2665958 2667543 Yeah, it's a little hobby<br />on the side.
2670754 2672381 It's the kids taught Dumbo.
2674842 2676885 Ah, yes.
2680472 2681598 Yeah?
2681682 2684268 And how on earth<br />did you do that?
2685227 2686603 With the scientific method.
2686728 2687938 (EXCLAIMS)
2688647 2690816 One picture, one picture!
2690899 2691817 Max.
2692776 2695445 You possess something<br />that's very rare in life.
2695529 2698073 And the tragedy of it is,
2698156 2699992 is you don't even know<br />that you have it.
2701034 2703704 Do you know what it is<br />that you have, Max?
2703787 2704788 No.
2704872 2706248 It's mystique.
2707541 2710085 VANDEVERE:<br />Max, I know your type.
2710169 2712546 Charlatan, con man,<br />opportunist...
2712629 2715632 New York is that way,<br />in case you need directions.
2715716 2718093 And I know it comes<br />from a deep desire
2718177 2720012 to build something<br />authentic and true.
2720095 2721805 I know your game.
2721889 2723140 It's not a game.
2723223 2726685 Some men cheat the rules,<br />others change them.
2727853 2729104 It's up your sleeve.
2730355 2732191 It's in your pocket.
2739489 2740866 The secret to show business
2740949 2742576 is always keep a rabbit<br />in your hat.
2742659 2745204 Or a monkey in your desk,<br />I guess.
2746872 2748290 MAX: Ownership shares?
2748373 2749499 Max, look around you.
2749583 2751919 Your entire way of life<br />is dying.
2752002 2753629 The future<br />of the entertainment business
2753712 2755422 is to bring<br />the audience to you.
2755506 2757341 And I've built<br />that destination.
2757424 2759885 What I'm lacking...
2759968 2762137 is a prot√©g√©.
2765224 2768352 I know<br />there's no Medici Brothers.
2769603 2772439 You probably always<br />wanted one.
2773690 2775108 You're offering me<br />a partnership?
2775192 2776318 Yes.
2776401 2778111 And a home.
2778195 2780113 For you and the entire troupe.
2780197 2783242 A home?<br />For all of us?

2785744 2787788 Join me and my family.
2787871 2790499 Let me take us all<br />into the future.

2838463 2840048 I wish Momma<br />could've seen this.

2849099 2851226 Way to work your magic, Max.

2861862 2863238 We hear you, Dumbo!
2864364 2865866 Why won't you<br />let him see outside?
2865949 2868202 Remember, young lady...
2868285 2869536 mystique.
2871121 2872539 (BAND CONTINUES PLAYING)
2873790 2875959 Now this is why<br />I joined the circus.

2882299 2883300 All right, sugar plum.
2883383 2884760 Remember, we got<br />a job to do here.
2884843 2887471 My daughter, she fancies<br />herself the next Marie Curie.
2888055 2891850 Don't ever let anybody<br />tell you what you can't do.
2891934 2894561 Hang on,<br />I wasn't saying she can't.
2894645 2898524 What is it exactly that<br />we do here, ma ch√©rie?
2899066 2902736 We make<br />the impossible possible.
2907824 2909243 SOTHEBY: And that's where<br />you'll perform.
2909326 2910536 The Colosseum!
2910619 2913580 Dumbo will stay<br />in the training tent behind.
2913664 2914665 JOE: Dumbo!
2914790 2916041 (TRUMPETS)
2920295 2921797 Why aren't we going with him?
2921880 2925717 Because that is your new home.
2931265 2932307 JOE: Wow!

2938856 2940816 We're grateful for the<br />opportunity, Mr. Vandevere.

2943944 2946071 -(HORSE NEIGHS)<br />-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
2946196 2949908 You know, I've been brushing<br />up on your story, Mr. Farrier.
2949992 2952035 Kentucky's top trick rider.
2952119 2953537 Well, there's no reason<br />you can't be again...
2953620 2956748 only here,<br />you'd be Captain Farrier...
2956832 2957875 war hero.
2958000 2959376 (FANFARE PLAYS)
2960669 2961670 One-armed wonder.

2963964 2964923 HOLT: Wow!
2965007 2966550 (STAMMERS)<br />Well, I still can ride.
2966633 2967801 VANDEVERE: Oh, I know you can.
2967885 2969428 And you're going to.
2970220 2971680 Right after you get<br />that little elephant
2971763 2972973 off the ground for me.
2973056 2974725 You mean<br />once his act's working?
2974808 2976435 You're back in the saddle.
2976518 2978437 We're still working<br />on the schedule
2978520 2979605 for the rest of your troupe...
2979688 2981648 but on Friday...
2981732 2983400 we premiere our little Dumbo.
2985986 2987946 I get goose bumps.
2990365 2991783 Why are you looking at me?
2992659 2994411 Well, because the only thing
2994494 2997539 more amazing<br />than a flying elephant...
2997623 2999041 is the goddess who can fly it.
3000792 3002794 Have you lost your mind?
3002878 3003879 (SCOFFS)
3005714 3008759 Let's not forget from<br />whence we came, darling.
3010844 3012763 So, we fly Friday!
3012846 3016350 Uh, Dumbo's never flown<br />with anyone.
3017017 3019895 That's why it's become<br />abundantly clear
3019978 3020979 why we need you.
3023148 3024483 MILLY AND JOE: Dumbo!
3024566 3025567 (TRUMPETS)
3028737 3030656 -Hey, buddy.<br />-We missed you. You all right?
3030739 3033408 Hey. Captain Farrier<br />is in charge.
3033492 3035410 No one sees the animal<br />without his approval.
3035953 3036912 Holt.
3036995 3038413 Just call me Holt.
3039831 3041750 I thought you were<br />a military man.
3041834 3044044 Nice boots you bagged there.<br />What are they, shark skin?
3044169 3046296 (CHUCKLES) No.
3047172 3048423 So you better keep<br />your elephant friend
3048507 3049925 on my good side.
3055305 3056265 Hiya, Dumbo.
3063480 3065440 Dumbo, you mind?
3065524 3066650 Can I get my arm?
3068402 3070279 And these are the hands<br />I'll be putting my life in?
3070988 3072781 Welcome.
3072865 3075284 For the record,<br />this was not my idea.
3075367 3076869 Dumbo works alone.
3076952 3078453 So do I.
3080497 3081748 Bonjour, Milly, Joe...
3083333 3084501 And you...
3085085 3086211 (HUFFS)
3088172 3089548 Hmm, charming.
3089631 3090883 Well, maybe he doesn't<br />recognize you
3090966 3092426 without your makeup.
3093385 3095137 So I gotta teach you to fly?
3095220 3098891 I know how to fly,<br />ever since I was a child.
3099641 3101935 They taught Dumbo to fly, no?
3102019 3103687 So I don't need<br />your expertise.
3105439 3106398 HOLT: All right.
3107816 3110277 Well, just so you know,<br />I've been to France.
3110360 3111987 It wasn't a good experience.
3112070 3113947 COLETTE: Show me your secret!
3114031 3115991 How on earth<br />does your elephant fly?
3116074 3118327 Well, first,<br />he needs a feather.
3119536 3121163 He won't fly<br />without a feather.
3122414 3125375 Well then, neither will I.

3295838 3298090 Exactly what do I do?
3298924 3300008 (MUMBLES)
3302344 3304513 HOLT: So where'd<br />Vandevere find you?
3306390 3308183 I was a street performer<br />in Paris.
3309685 3311061 He discovered me.
3311186 3312938 And here I am.
3315148 3316942 A millionaire's girlfriend.
3317025 3318277 That's a tough break.
3319945 3321154 It's all for show.
3321989 3324491 So you and he,<br />you're not, uh...
3324575 3326326 I'm one of many gems he wears
3326410 3327828 to reflect the light<br />back onto him.
3329162 3330163 Huh.
3331832 3332958 Good boy, Dumbo.

4248332 4249917 and he'll do<br />whatever you want.

4292334 4293794 it was a blessing really.
4293877 4296797 Because I had to learn<br />how to fend for myself.
4296880 4298799 Maybe that's what<br />your children need.

4509676 4510761 and to be honest with you...
4510844 4514056 they're really pale imitations<br />from the acts we already have.
4514139 4515891 So I was thinking,<br />I don't know,
4515974 4517643 a month's severance?<br />Seems fair.
4517726 4519102 Capisce?
4520562 4522356 I thought you promised to...
