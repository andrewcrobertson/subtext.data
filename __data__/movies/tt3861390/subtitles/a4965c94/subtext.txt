47090 51300 Come on, time to go.<br />We haven't got all day.
51470 53890 Get that monkey on the train.
55520 58940 The Medici Brothers' circus is taking off!
179020 180020 Breathing normal...
180730 182230 heart rate normal.
183390 184690 You're cleared to perform.
185980 188360 Milly!<br />Another train!
195280 197280 <i>Niños,</i> wait!<br />We are coming, too!
209750 210880 Joplin!
211460 212510 Joplin, Missouri!
213220 215470 -Hey, sweetheart!<br />-Daddy!
246710 249250 Oh, I meant to tell ya.
249420 250920 You know, in the letter I sent?
252130 255430 I'm so sorry that I wasn't here.
256510 257840 Well, come here now.
258970 260180 Still me.
267400 268900 And you...
270900 272230 you're just as pretty as your momma.
281030 282200 We missed you, Dad.
283830 285080 I missed you, too.
289080 291290 Ivan and Catherine, thank you both...
291460 293000 for looking out for them.
293170 294590 Captain Farrier, of course.
294760 296380 It's Holt, come on now.
296550 297800 It's just Holt.
297970 299470 Don't you worry.
301180 303310 Everything's gonna be<br />just like it was before.
307480 308480 Come on! Come on!
308650 309940 Home sweet home.
310100 312230 -Hey! Holt!<br />-Hey, Puck.
313400 314530 -Hey, Thomas.<br />-Milly, come on!
314690 315860 Hi, Holt.
317490 319030 Hey, Miss Atlantis.
320820 322370 Pramesh!
322530 324160 The very best journey, dear friend.
324330 326580 The road that leads home.
326750 327830 Welcome home.
331250 332250 No hugs!
333670 336170 Pramesh, I missed you, too.
336340 339380 What's going on?<br />The camp's half the size it used to be.
339550 342010 Hard times, my friend.<br />For everyone.
348520 350270 Attention, everybody!
350730 354650 Why is Rule Number One<br />called Rule Number One?
354820 359610 Because "keep the cages locked"<br />is the most important rule of all!
359780 363280 When I catch that fugitive scalawag<br />who interrupted my dream...
363450 364330 Rongo!
364490 365740 Where is Rongo?
367950 369790 Who's heading camp management?
369960 370960 I'm the strongman.
371120 373670 Yes, but we're all wearing multiple hats!
373840 377420 You're in charge of budgets,<br />and accounting, and inventory.
377590 380050 Which means animal whereabouts!
380220 382090 Now, go find that monkey!
382260 384140 I'll have a look around.
391060 392600 All right, everybody. Back to work.
396860 398030 Holt!
408160 411660 This winter, the influenza<br />hit us like a hurricane.
412420 415080 Natalya, Vincenzo...
415250 417800 the Vanderjees, and then...
419170 421170 your wife.
421340 422970 Poor Annie.
425600 427260 How she fought.
430480 432020 She was the best of us.
433140 434900 I know it.
435060 439110 So, you know, for her,<br />let's have our best season yet!
440490 442030 Now where's my horses?
444280 445910 Funny story about that.
446070 447330 Funny how?
447490 448450 He sold them.
449580 451290 But our act is the soul of this show!
451450 455830 And first, we lost you,<br />and then Annie, to ride 'em!
456000 458170 If only Milly would have learned the trade.
458340 459840 I don't wanna be a show-off in your circus.
460000 462010 -"Show-off"?<br />-You see?
462170 464510 I wanna make scientific discoveries.
464680 466340 I wanna be noticed for my mind.
466510 467510 Okay.
467680 471470 Then learn clairvoyance. Telepathy!<br />Something!
471640 474520 I can do a handstand for almost ten seconds.
477110 480570 "Child does handstand."<br />We'll be broke by July.
481070 483860 Hang on now.<br />Without horses, what the hell's my act?
484820 486780 The crowds come to see me!
487240 488280 Max, please.
489740 491620 I need to work.
493040 494500 Good news.
494660 496290 One job, I have.
496460 498420 Okay, then. Give me a showstopper.
498580 501750 You know that old rascal Itchy McPhee?<br />He finally ran off with the bearded lady.
501920 505050 I've been filling in with<br />roustabouts ever since.
506050 508050 I need somebody good to tend the elephants.
508220 510100 No, you're not serious.
510260 511390 I am on occasion.
511560 513020 This is a big job and you know it.
513180 514600 No, it's a big shovel for a big pile of...
514770 515770 Dad.
518400 521360 So you sold my horses<br />and kept your elephants.
521520 524690 Your scrawny, mangy, cut-rate elephants.
524860 527240 They're important.<br />Especially this season.
527740 528740 Why's that?
528910 530870 I know it goes against my nature...
531030 534660 but for once, I made an investment.
538000 539880 There she is!
540040 542590 Our brand-new Asian female.
542750 547680 I bought her off a Brugelbecker in Biloxi.<br />I had to get him way down on the price.
547840 552390 But I swear to you, Holt,<br />I saw something special in her eyes.
552560 555480 This is your investment?<br />An old, sick elephant.
556020 558190 Oh, no. She's not sick.
559150 560610 Any day now...
560770 562940 She's having a baby.
567450 570070 Dad, watch! Dad! I'm getting better!
570240 571780 Hang on now, this is our tent?
573160 574490 What happened to our things?
574660 577710 We had nice furniture, we had rooms.
578920 581040 Max, what didn't you sell?
581210 582540 You son of a gun.
582710 584130 Dad, look!
584750 585920 Toys?
586090 589300 They're not toys.<br />They're for my science experiments.
589720 591970 Well, we're a circus, darlin', a circus.
592140 594640 We need to be practical<br />if we want to survive.
594810 597270 You couldn't just take up one act?
597430 599640 Tumblin' or tightrope?
599810 601650 Maybe I don't need the world staring at me.
602980 604570 Maybe I'm just not you and Mom.
604730 606030 Well, who makes the rules in this family?
606480 607490 Mom did.
607650 609280 Yeah, well, I make them now.
609450 611200 So just... Go to your room!
611360 612620 This is my room.
613950 615660 This is all our rooms.
616240 617830 See this?
618370 619910 You know what this is?
620080 621580 It's your inheritance.
623790 624880 Dad!
625420 628550 Don't worry, he's not going anywhere.
628720 630380 He's stuck here.
630550 632300 Like you and me.
645940 647570 Come on, come on,<br />you're missing it!
649860 652950 Look, I can do it!<br />I'm doing it, Milly!
653110 654870 A new season!
668050 670260 Let me in, you little hairball!
678060 679140 Hey!
680430 683020 Would somebody please let me in my own train?
726730 728150 Dad, wake up! Let's go!
728310 729480 The elephants need us!
729650 732400 Good God, son,<br />you're gonna make me miss the war.
733610 735910 Gimme that. Go on, lead the way.
736070 737870 Move it!
740540 742910 Let's skedaddle, Mrs. Jumbo!<br />Don't make me have to incentivize.
743080 744870 Get her out of there, boys.
747250 748630 Easy, Rufus.
748790 749960 That's a lady in there.
750130 752920 Well, well, our own Tom Mix<br />ridin' in to the rescue.
753090 755220 But he just ain't on the marquee no more.
755380 756970 Time to see what he's been missing.
757140 758590 Do you ever get that feeling?
758760 760050 Like there's something you're missing?
760220 762350 Imagine my surprise, you didn't enlist.
762520 764430 Weak ticker. Doc's advice.
765100 767900 Dad? Something's wrong.
768100 769690 She doesn't wanna leave.
774240 775240 Come on!
775400 776900 Let's get her outta there!
779700 780780 What are you doing?
780950 781660 Come on!
783200 784120 Leave her alone!
784290 785960 -Stop hurting her, please!<br />-Leave her alone!
798010 798970 Dad, look.
799140 800510 What now?
801640 802760 Move her!
805640 808350 Whoa, we got a baby in here.
814650 815490 She had a baby!
815650 817820 Baby!<br />Notify the press!
817990 818990 "The Medici Brothers...
819160 823410 "proudly present America's newest,<br />precious bundle of joy!"
825370 826540 Look at that.
828080 829000 It's okay now.
830500 832290 Don't be scared.
834750 838380 Don't be scared now,<br />your momma's right outside.
869500 871290 Baby! We got a baby!
871460 872920 We got a baby!
878380 879630 What is that?
879800 880840 Baby Jumbo.
882890 885010 I already got fake freaks in the freak show!
885180 887310 I don't need a real one in the center ring!
887470 889980 Rongo!<br />We've been swindled!
890890 892560 Gone and bought yourself a baby monster.
892730 894520 Think he can hear me?
896440 897440 Boo!
915380 918000 Rongo! Telegram to Brugelbecker.
918170 919920 "We have been bilked with damaged goods.
920090 923430 "This is an aberration, travestation...
923590 925090 "and I demand my money back."
925260 927890 But whatever you do, do not call the papers.
928060 930430 We are not advertising this baby.
932230 933270 Tell me you didn't do it.
934150 935440 You did it?
936150 940280 Never do anything I tell ya<br />without checking with me first!
945070 947030 Why me? Why me?
947740 949700 A face only a mother could love.
949870 950790 Sir?
950950 953250 Many of us find you handsome.
953410 955290 I was talking about the elephant!
960050 962670 Look, she's drawing him a bath.
968430 970100 Need a vet to come to look at him, Max.
970260 971850 No, no witnesses!
972020 975600 We are going to be in Joplin for two weeks.<br />We promised them a beautiful baby!
975770 977940 You have until tomorrow night to fix that!
978110 979520 -Me?<br />-Yes, you!
979690 980820 This is my problem?
980980 982110 Yes.<br />You tend the elephants.
982280 984150 Make those ears disappear!
992450 993910 Don't look at me.
1002550 1004590 Look at him,<br />those giant ears weigh him down.
1008140 1009550 Hi, Baby Jumbo.
1009720 1011310 Welcome to the circus.
1011470 1014430 We're all family here.<br />No matter how small.
1015480 1017770 Aren't elephants afraid of mice?
1017940 1020440 Says who?<br />That's why we experiment.
1021270 1023820 Someone needs to keep him company<br />when he's not with his momma.
1035660 1037210 Look. Give him one.
1037370 1039920 If he can lift his ears out of the way.
1041500 1043630 No. You have to blow your ears<br />out of the way.
1043800 1045130 Like this.
1049590 1052510 Good luck with that.<br />Maybe you can teach him to juggle, too.
1053100 1054680 Baby Jumbo, look at me.
1054850 1055850 Do what I do.
1056020 1057310 Blow.
1064820 1067950 No, not the feather.<br />Your ears. Blow!
1068150 1070110 He thinks it's a game.
1071410 1072830 -Max, come here.<br />-What?
1072990 1074040 Watch this.
1075040 1078210 I ride out, I do some jumps,<br />then all of a sudden...
1078790 1079790 stampede!
1080420 1081250 Send 'em!
1083040 1084340 Get out of the way, Max!
1087590 1089800 I'm still working out the timing.
1095720 1097310 Let me have a turn.
1111910 1114410 Meanwhile,<br />for when you lead out the elephants...
1114580 1116740 I had the costume departments<br />make you up a little something.
1116910 1117830 Okay.
1119460 1120790 What in gosh...
1120960 1122630 You really broke the bank with this, Max.
1122790 1124170 A lot of kids come to the show.
1124340 1125920 You don't want me to scare anyone,<br />I get it.
1126090 1127010 Dad, Dad!
1127170 1128630 It's Baby Jumbo. Come see.
1128800 1130550 He jumped in the air. With his ears.
1130720 1132140 Guys, I said leave him be.
1132300 1133340 But he was this far off the ground!
1133510 1134510 Yeah, I bet he was.
1134680 1136260 He'll be tripping all over<br />with ears like that.
1136720 1138390 Dad, really. We tried an experiment.
1138600 1140270 Just leave the poor guy alone.
1144690 1147400 First rule of science,<br />you have to have interest.
1147570 1149940 Otherwise, you don't deserve to know.
1151990 1154070 It's been a rough year for both of them.
1155030 1156830 Annie knew how to talk to 'em.
1162080 1166040 <i>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,<br />step right up.</i>
1166210 1168420 <i>Hurry, hurry. Come see the circus today.</i>
1173180 1177010 "To be or not to be...
1177510 1179810 "that is the question.
1180020 1183730 "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br />the slings and arrows of outrageous..."
1201870 1202910 That ain't no snake.
1203080 1204210 Heck, I could do it.
1204710 1206210 As you wish.
1206960 1208000 Get out of here!
1209300 1210960 Rongo, let's go!
1214340 1217100 Hey, get away from the baby elephant!
1239740 1242790 Welcome, Joplin, Missouri!
1242950 1244870 Ladies and gentlemen...
1245040 1250130 I am your Master of Ceremonies,<br />Maximilian Medici.
1251420 1254380 And now, I give to you...
1254550 1256970 the Medici Brothers' circus.
1265390 1266390 Okay.
1266560 1268270 Okay, okay, no one's gonna hurt him.
1268440 1270360 Okay, little guy, let's put on a show.
1297630 1300720 Hey, ain't that Holt Farrier,<br />the Stallion Star?
1301470 1302310 Hey!
1302470 1303720 Ain't you Holt Farrier?
1304970 1307350 Nah, he died in the war.<br />So sad.
1322580 1323740 What's he doing?
1330330 1332250 He's reaching for the feathers.
1340840 1342680 Coat, coat, coat, coat!
1360780 1363200 What'd you do to that thing?<br />That ain't a real elephant.
1363370 1364910 Those ears are fake!
1365080 1366660 Look! Look at the sign!
1366830 1367910 "Dumbo!"
1377880 1379050 Calm down, now.
1383340 1384680 He's a fake!
1384850 1386140 Yeah, he's a fake!
1386310 1387310 Shut up!
1387680 1389020 You're scaring the elephants!
1390980 1392650 Take it easy now. Calm down.
1392810 1394650 Dumbo, Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!
1396650 1397570 All right, sit down.
1397730 1399940 -Dumbo, Dumbo, fake, fake, fake!<br />-I said sit down!
1400990 1402160 It's okay, little fella.
1403820 1404950 Fake!
1406780 1408410 Rongo! Music!
1408580 1410660 Happiness, joy!
1418250 1421050 Hear 'em making fun of your ugly baby?
1421720 1423640 Who's gonna help him now?
1425930 1429270 Holt, get those ears off the stage!
1438190 1439900 Okay, all right.
1440070 1441280 Okay, nobody's gonna hurt your baby.
1441440 1442950 Just calm down.
1444240 1446370 Okay. Attagirl.
1446530 1448280 We're here to protect him. Same as you.
1449620 1451000 Attagirl.
1451620 1452790 Nice and easy.
1457500 1458880 Okay, nobody's gonna hurt your baby.
1461300 1462510 Rufus, no!
1464340 1465890 -Rufus, stop!<br />-Mad elephant!
1466050 1467100 Get back!
1473390 1475020 Max, get the kids out of here!
1475190 1476980 Everybody, out!<br />Get to safety.
1477150 1478520 Careful, careful.
1485660 1486950 Kids?
1487120 1488240 Go, go, go!
1488410 1489410 Quick, quick, quick.<br />Go, go, go.
1489580 1490620 Come on, this way.
1492330 1495080 How do you like your job now, cowboy?
1502670 1504470 Milly, Joe!<br />Come on!
1506340 1507720 Let's go!<br />Come on!
1540960 1544090 And I wanna just emphasize,<br />we did everything right.
1544260 1547510 What it is, the tent just absolutely<br />fell down. It just collapsed.
1547680 1549890 And we had no way of knowing<br />what was gonna happen.
1676800 1680520 Brugelbecker, I have a man dead,<br />do you understand?
1680680 1683850 This is what they're reading<br />from the Great Lakes to the Gulf!
1684060 1687360 You have a moral responsibility<br />to buy your killer elephant back.
1688070 1689400 What about the baby?
1690690 1693280 Well, at least he got a few laughs.
1693450 1697120 I'll put him in the clown act,<br />see if I can salvage something.
1699290 1700910 I'll buy her back half price.
1702540 1704960 You will buy her back full price.
1705120 1706380 Quarter price.
1706540 1708800 Half price it is!
1714380 1715590 Up!
1718720 1720640 What's happening?<br />Where are they taking her?
1720810 1721980 Away. Back to your tent now.
1722140 1723600 But she's his mom!
1723770 1725560 Dad, please. Stop them.
1725730 1726900 Please!
1727060 1728520 Do something.
1728690 1730230 Mom would have done something.
1731030 1732610 Momma's not here.
1737660 1739780 Okay, little fella. Okay. Come on.
1743450 1744460 I know, I do.
1746000 1749880 Beautiful creature,<br />we'll take care of your son.
1831830 1833250 Darlin', it's late.
1834500 1836090 Go on now.
1888890 1891940 I know. I can't sleep, either.
1892940 1897730 My momma told me there'd be times<br />when my life seemed locked behind a door.
1899610 1904620 So, she gave me this key,<br />that her momma gave her.
1905870 1911210 And said whenever I have that feeling,<br />imagine that door...
1911580 1912750 and just turn the key.
1915630 1917550 So, I keep trying.
1925550 1927260 Not supposed to be in here alone.
1927760 1929680 I'm not. You're here.
1929850 1931020 What's that?
1931180 1933310 I just thought he might be hungry.
1933810 1935310 He's sad.
1936440 1937770 You don't eat when you're sad.
1937940 1939400 The mermaid does.
1941240 1942570 Come on.
1942740 1944990 Have one, Dumbo.
1945450 1946820 We're calling him Dumbo now?
1947530 1949620 If we call him Jumbo Junior...
1949790 1952160 it might make him miss his mom.
1957590 1960590 Here you go... Dumbo.
1961670 1964220 Come on, and flap those ears again.
1964380 1966590 To show us we didn't imagine it.
1970970 1974140 Your momma,<br />she didn't mean to hurt anyone.
1975100 1977150 She was just protecting you.
1977310 1979900 And we think your ears are great.
1984610 1986780 Maybe he wants to be alone.<br />Like Dad.
1987620 1989660 Nobody wants to be alone.
1990580 1991580 Well...
1993290 1995080 if you change your mind...
1998130 1999630 Night-night, Dumbo.
2029530 2030580 Wow!
2034620 2036620 It's not the peanuts that made him do it.
2036790 2038040 It's the feathers!
2044960 2045970 Dumbo!
2076540 2078620 Dumbo, you gotta do this in the show.
2078790 2079790 What do you mean?
2080420 2083000 'Cause if the circus sells more tickets<br />and Medici makes more money...
2083170 2085300 then we can get him to use some<br />to buy Mrs. Jumbo back.
2085460 2086510 Yeah!
2086670 2088970 We can get her back, Dumbo.<br />You can.
2089130 2090760 Just show them all what you can do.
2090930 2092260 Come on. We gotta tell Dad.
2092430 2095100 No. He'll just tell us to be practical.
2095260 2097060 Shows got canceled for a week, right?
2097220 2099310 We can research and study and test.
2101190 2103860 You're a miracle elephant, Dumbo.
2104020 2106230 And we're gonna bring your momma home.
2109280 2110950 Fire!
2132260 2133340 So low.
2133760 2135260 An all-time low.
2135430 2137180 Who said he didn't want to be recognized?
2139310 2142350 Okay, Big D, this is it.<br />Just like in rehearsal.
2142520 2144360 Except for lights, music, fire and crowds.
2144520 2145320 You can do it.
2145480 2146480 Come on, Dumbo.
2148320 2149320 You can do it, Dumbo!
2149490 2150740 Show 'em all like you showed us!
2155330 2157240 -Come! Come! Come!<br />-Attaboy, come on.
2157990 2159870 Keep comin'. Come on.
2166130 2167800 Go on now, Dumbo!<br />Come on.
2175760 2177430 Hey! Hey!
2199120 2201000 They love it! They love it!
2205290 2206330 All right, Dumbo.
2206500 2207790 You put out the fire.
2225980 2227400 He won't fly. He's scared.
2227560 2229270 I know.<br />Now, he's up too high.
2236530 2237530 Go on, Dumbo!
2252760 2253840 Attaboy.
2256260 2258430 Yeah! Rule Number One.
2258590 2260260 "Always have a big finish!"
2269610 2271480 Okay, guys.<br />Bring him down.
2272730 2273780 Yeah!
2285250 2286080 Holt!
2286870 2288290 -Look, Max!<br />-What? What?
2288460 2290210 -He's trapped up there.<br />-Put the fire out!
2292710 2293880 Dumbo! Fly!
2294050 2295840 He won't fly without a feather!
2300300 2302350 Put the fire out!
2302760 2303600 Put it out!
2304970 2306230 -Joe!<br />-Stop!
2307940 2310770 Holt, I thought she didn't want to be<br />in an act.
2313730 2314900 Milly!
2331790 2332880 Here, Dumbo!
2334050 2335050 Come on.
2335710 2336710 Show 'em.
2338470 2339720 Come on, Dumbo.
2367000 2367870 Fly, Dumbo.
2368040 2368960 Fly!
2385970 2387060 Yeah!
2422470 2424090 You knew he could do this?
2424260 2426140 You should talk to your kids more.
2437110 2438110 Sotheby...
2438270 2439690 cancel my dinner with the president.
2440360 2442700 We've got business with an elephant.
2446070 2450660 Friends, the next available shows<br />are in Arkansas!
2451660 2453160 <i>Happy clowns!</i>
2458170 2460550 -Rongo the Strong!<br />-Boss.
2461210 2462470 Hello, Jo!
2462630 2464930 The Medici Brothers' circus.
2465090 2469060 Where true love and mystery abound!
2470350 2472640 Now where's my star?
2473690 2475060 Dumbo!
2475230 2476270 How's your bath?
2476440 2478310 Too warm? Too cold?
2478480 2481570 Ladies, make sure his wrinkles<br />don't get wrinkles.
2481730 2486320 In our country, legend tells us<br />the gods can take animal forms.
2486950 2488490 Champagne for Dumbo!
2488660 2490160 No booze near the baby!
2512770 2513980 Sorry, Dumbo.
2515310 2516390 It's not your momma.
2516560 2518230 Take Dumbo back inside.
2528780 2531740 Ladies and gentlemen, please make way<br />for the emperor of enchantment.
2531910 2533240 For the architect of dreams.
2533410 2535330 For the Columbus of Coney Island.
2535500 2537870 Mr. V.A. Vandevere!
2541420 2544840 And traveling with him,<br />his bright shining star.
2545010 2548300 Colette Marchant,<br />the Queen of the Heavens!
2548470 2550090 Miss Marchant! Miss Marchant!
2555560 2557100 <i>Signore</i> Medici!
2557890 2559310 He knows who I am.
2559480 2561020 We were just passing through Missouri...
2561190 2563110 and we heard you were putting on<br />a little show.
2563270 2566280 Mr. Vandevere. It's an honor.
2566690 2569820 No, sir. The honor is mine.
2572410 2573790 I would like to offer you a drink.
2574540 2576620 But I'm all out of bourbon.
2578210 2580420 And cognac and scotch.
2586550 2587880 Not now!
2590550 2592300 Is that a monkey in your desk?
2593220 2594430 Just for emergencies.
2594600 2596850 Look, Mr. Vandevere...
2597020 2598560 I probably should tell you...
2598730 2601020 the elephant is not for sale.
2601190 2603690 Dumbo will only fly for the Medici circus.
2603860 2606230 That's assuming he is real.
2613320 2614530 See for yourself.
2614700 2617080 And all due respect, I don't got all day.
2617250 2618660 -Pleasure to meet you...<br />-Excuse me.
2619830 2620920 Hello there.
2629260 2631050 So this creature of yours...
2631220 2632840 is supposed to fly?
2634350 2635760 Trade secrets.
2645570 2648480 Max, if you don't mind my asking...
2648650 2652950 where did you come upon the animal?
2653110 2655280 He hails from the far east.
2655450 2656450 How far?
2656620 2658080 Far.
2658240 2659790 He doesn't look like "magic" to me.
2661710 2663670 Well, what the heck can you tell<br />by appearances, right?
2664000 2666540 And you train flying elephants, too?
2666710 2668800 Yeah, it's a little hobby on the side.
2671510 2673220 It's the kids taught Dumbo.
2675850 2677720 Ah, yes.
2681270 2682390 Yeah?
2682560 2685100 And how on earth did you do that?
2686020 2687440 With the scientific method.
2689400 2691530 One picture, one picture!
2691690 2692650 Max.
2693570 2696160 You possess something<br />that's very rare in life.
2696320 2700790 And the tragedy of it is,<br />is you don't even know that you have it.
2701830 2704420 Do you know what it is that you have, Max?
2704580 2705500 No.
2705670 2707250 It's mystique.
2708340 2710800 Max, I know your type.
2710960 2713340 Charlatan, con man, opportunist...
2713510 2716340 New York is that way,<br />in case you need directions.
2716510 2720720 And I know it comes from a deep desire<br />to build something authentic and true.
2720890 2722520 I know your game.
2722680 2723850 It's not a game.
2724020 2727480 Some men cheat the rules,<br />others change them.
2728650 2729940 It's up your sleeve.
2731150 2732990 It's in your pocket.
2740280 2743370 The secret to show business<br />is always keep a rabbit in your hat.
2743540 2746040 Or a monkey in your desk, I guess.
2747630 2749090 Ownership shares?
2749250 2752710 Max, look around you.<br />Your entire way of life is dying.
2752880 2756220 The future of the entertainment business<br />is to bring the audience to you.
2756380 2758050 And I've built that destination.
2758220 2760600 What I'm lacking...
2760760 2762350 is a protégé.
2766020 2769150 I know there's no Medici Brothers.
2770360 2773230 You probably always wanted one.
2774490 2775820 You're offering me a partnership?
2775990 2776990 Yes.
2777160 2778910 And a home.
2779070 2780660 For you and the entire troupe.
2780950 2783950 A home?<br />For all of us?
2784120 2786460 Yes. Join me.
2786620 2788500 Join me and my family.
2788670 2791210 Let me take us all into the future.
2791380 2794380 Let me take us all...
2794550 2796300 to Dreamland!
2839340 2840890 I wish Momma could've seen this.
2841970 2844350 Well, somehow,<br />I think she knows we're here.
2849890 2852020 Way to work your magic, Max.
2862620 2864080 We hear you, Dumbo!
2865160 2866790 Why won't you let him see outside?
2866950 2868910 Remember, young lady...
2869080 2870370 mystique.
2874500 2877210 Now this is why I joined the circus.
2880430 2882550 Dad.<br />Wonders of Science!
2883010 2885430 All right, sugar plum.<br />Remember, we got a job to do here.
2885600 2888310 My daughter, she fancies herself<br />the next Marie Curie.
2889020 2892520 Don't ever let anybody tell you<br />what you can't do.
2892690 2895230 Hang on, I wasn't saying she can't.
2895400 2899320 What is it exactly that we do here,<br /><i>ma chérie?</i>
2899780 2902570 We make the impossible possible.
2908540 2910040 And that's where you'll perform.
2910200 2911250 The Colosseum!
2911410 2913830 Dumbo will stay in the training tent behind.
2914460 2915500 Dumbo!
2921050 2922590 Why aren't we going with him?
2922760 2926550 Because that is your new home.
2932060 2933140 Wow!
2934350 2935980 Look at this place!
2936150 2937440 A library...
2937610 2939480 "And the children shall lead them."
2939650 2941530 We're grateful for the opportunity,<br />Mr. Vandevere.
2941690 2943990 Your family's mine.
2946990 2950620 You know, I've been brushing up<br />on your story, Mr. Farrier.
2950790 2952750 Kentucky's top trick rider.
2952910 2954330 Well, there's no reason<br />you can't be again...
2954500 2957420 only here, you'd be Captain Farrier...
2957590 2958710 war hero.
2961460 2962470 One-armed wonder.
2962630 2964010 National treasure.
2964760 2965720 Wow!
2965890 2967350 Well, I still can ride.
2967510 2968600 Oh, I know you can.
2968760 2970220 And you're going to.
2970970 2973770 Right after you get that little elephant<br />off the ground for me.
2974060 2975520 You mean once his act's working?
2975690 2977230 You're back in the saddle.
2977650 2980320 We're still working on the schedule<br />for the rest of your troupe...
2980480 2982360 but on Friday...
2982530 2984240 we premiere our little Dumbo.
2986740 2988740 I get goose bumps.
2991160 2992620 Why are you looking at me?
2993450 2997830 Well, because the only thing more amazing<br />than a flying elephant...
2998420 2999880 is the goddess who can fly it.
3001550 3003590 Have you lost your mind?
3006510 3009550 Let's not forget from<br />whence we came, darling.
3011970 3013560 So, we fly Friday!
3014560 3017190 Dumbo's never flown with anyone.
3017810 3022780 That's why it's become abundantly clear<br />why we need you.
3023900 3025400 Dumbo!
3029490 3031330 -Hey, buddy.<br />-We missed you. You all right?
3031490 3034200 Hey. Captain Farrier is in charge.
3034370 3036210 No one sees the animal without his approval.
3036710 3037620 Holt.
3037790 3039250 Just call me Holt.
3040630 3042550 I thought you were a military man.
3042710 3044880 Nice boots you bagged there.<br />What are they, shark skin?
3046090 3047380 No.
3047930 3050760 So you better keep your elephant friend<br />on my good side.
3056100 3057100 Hiya, Dumbo.
3064230 3066110 Dumbo, you mind?
3066280 3067450 Can I get my arm?
3069160 3071120 And these are the hands<br />I'll be putting my life in?
3071780 3072910 Welcome.
3073620 3076000 For the record, this was not my idea.
3076160 3077660 Dumbo works alone.
3077830 3079290 So do I.
3081170 3082590 <i>Bonjour,</i> Milly, Joe...
3084090 3085340 And you...
3088930 3090340 Charming.
3090510 3093390 Well, maybe he doesn't recognize you<br />without your makeup.
3094180 3095850 So I gotta teach you to fly?
3096020 3099770 I know how to fly, ever since I was a child.
3100440 3102650 They taught Dumbo to fly, no?
3102810 3104520 So I don't need your expertise.
3106190 3107190 All right.
3108610 3110820 Well, just so you know, I've been to France.
3111160 3112780 It wasn't a good experience.
3112950 3114660 Show me your secret!
3114830 3116700 How on earth does your elephant fly?
3116870 3119160 Well, first,<br />he needs a feather.
3120330 3122000 He won't fly without a feather.
3123210 3126210 Well then, neither will I.
3154070 3155740 Whoa, slow down, princess. Safety first.
3155910 3156870 Guys, nets.
3157040 3158290 Come on, hurry.
3161460 3163210 All right, guys, good.
3172130 3173760 See, Dumbo?
3174890 3177010 I fly!
3185360 3187070 See if you can catch me!
3190070 3191360 Here, Dumbo!
3251800 3254090 We got some work to do.
3263730 3264770 Friends and colleagues...
3264930 3267690 let's give a warm Dreamland welcome<br />to our new executive vice president...
3267850 3268860 Mr. Max Medici.
3271690 3273650 Anything he needs, anything at all...
3273820 3275780 make it happen as you always do.
3280530 3281990 This is Miss Verna.
3282160 3285960 She will handle your schedule,<br />correspondence, and all your calls.
3286120 3288830 When you're needed in meetings,<br />she'll let you know.
3289330 3290590 Are there meetings today?
3290750 3292380 I'll let you know!
3294800 3296550 Mr. Vandevere, one question.
3296720 3298930 Exactly what do I do?
3303140 3305310 So where'd Vandevere find you?
3307190 3309020 I was a street performer in Paris.
3310480 3311900 He discovered me.
3312270 3313780 And here I am.
3316190 3317650 A millionaire's girlfriend.
3317820 3319110 That's a tough break.
3320740 3321990 It's all for show.
3322780 3325200 So you and he, you're not...
3325370 3328670 I'm one of many gems he wears<br />to reflect the light back onto him.
3332590 3333670 Good boy, Dumbo.
3333840 3336090 -Good job.<br />-Yeah! They're gonna love him.
3336260 3337970 I think you are the lucky one.
3340300 3341890 -Well done, Dumbo.<br />-Good boy.
3342050 3345350 Who's been dreaming<br />like I've been dreaming?
3346850 3349100 So, how's everything?
3349270 3351100 -Good?<br />-We're making progress.
3351270 3352690 But he ain't quite ready yet.
3352860 3355400 What's the problem?<br />Doesn't the animal trust you?
3355570 3357940 -It's not that simple.<br /><i>-Ma chérie...</i>
3358110 3361490 we've already sold all the tickets.
3361660 3365280 Maybe our little scientist here<br />can show us that it's going to work.
3378170 3379420 Prepare for takeoff.
3379590 3380840 -Right wing?<br />-Check!
3382840 3383850 Left wing?
3384010 3385140 Check!
3385850 3387430 Take her up, Dumbo.
3391850 3393270 Let's go.
3393440 3395230 -Come on, buddy. Come on.<br />-Come on, Dumbo.
3397110 3398990 That's it.<br />Come on.
3405580 3407120 Let's try it again.
3408490 3410330 You got this.<br />Here you go.
3425090 3427350 You beautiful one-armed cowboy.
3428640 3430930 You've made me a child again.
3442740 3445570 <i>Welcome to the Colosseum...</i>
3445740 3448240 <i>where the impossible is possible.</i>
3491580 3494250 <i>Buonasera.</i> Max Medici.
3495120 3497380 I discovered the elephant, my elephant.
3497540 3500340 And basically I said no.<br />I walked out and that was the end of that.
3500500 3501920 The flying elephant's mine.
3502090 3502920 Yeah.
3504170 3505800 You're the guy!
3505970 3508050 You're the guy that's made out of magic dust!
3508720 3509890 Max.
3510050 3512390 J. Griffin Remington. Atlas Forge Bank.
3512560 3514640 He's the money man.
3514810 3515810 The J?
3517020 3518900 It's a pleasure to meet you.
3519060 3520060 How are you?
3520230 3522070 You know, they say<br />the moon is made out of magic dust.
3522230 3525030 That's why they're going to send<br />a man up there one of these days.
3525190 3529320 And my bank is going to be the bank<br />that finances the expedition.
3529820 3531160 What do you think of that?
3532490 3533830 Needless to say, Max...
3534000 3535660 we all have high hopes for tonight.
3535830 3538500 Oh, yeah. High hopes.<br />High hopes.
3538670 3541920 Well, you know, hopes, and dreams,<br />that's one thing. That's words.
3542090 3544130 But what we're talking about here is facts!
3544300 3545380 Plans!
3545550 3547800 Plans! That takes a lot of money.
3547970 3549340 Which he hasn't got!
3549510 3552930 So, we are hoping that your pachyderm<br />comes through with the goods.
3553100 3555890 Now let's get this show on the road!
3562650 3564190 We are looking good!
3565570 3566690 Don't worry, Big D.
3566860 3569070 There's just more room to fly out there,<br />that's all.
3569240 3570990 Round and round, just like we practiced.
3571620 3573950 And then Dad can talk to Vandevere<br />about the deal!
3574120 3575290 About the what?
3575450 3576540 We made a deal with Dumbo.
3576700 3579540 We promised we'd buy his mom back<br />with all the money he makes for the circus.
3579710 3580920 That's why he flies.
3582130 3583800 -Joe, not now!<br />-Are we ready?
3584920 3585880 Yeah.
3592260 3594310 Okay, let's go.
3594470 3596470 Okay, Dumbo, let's do this.
3655660 3657410 Pink elephants?
3657580 3658830 So?
3717930 3722730 <i>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />boys and girls of all ages!</i>
3722890 3726850 <i>This is the moment<br />we've all been waiting for!</i>
3727020 3731280 <i>V.A. Vandevere,<br />in association with Max Medici...</i>
3731440 3735860 <i>proudly presents,<br />making his Dreamland debut...</i>
3736030 3738240 <i>You've seen a horse-fly.</i>
3738410 3740830 <i>You've seen a dragonfly.</i>
3740990 3743500 <i>You've even seen a housefly.</i>
3743960 3746000 <i>But you haven't seen anything...</i>
3746170 3749880 <i>until you see an elephant fly.</i>
3750040 3752960 <i>Let's get ready for Dumbo!</i>
3770270 3771770 Coming through.
3773150 3774320 Come on.
3793130 3794340 He can do it.
3796840 3798130 I know he can.
3802850 3805060 <i>And here to welcome him...</i>
3805220 3809980 <i>our own Queen of the Heavens!</i>
3860950 3862570 Dumbo.
3863870 3867250 Five times around the ring.<br />That's all we have to do.
3868450 3869790 Nice and easy, like we practiced.
3876550 3877550 Dad?
3878210 3879260 Why aren't they putting up the nets?
3882390 3883800 Hey, guys?
3883970 3886060 Guys, what's going on?<br />Your men are supposed to be out there!
3886220 3887390 Change of plan. From the top.
3898440 3900240 I can't see the nets.
3901110 3902820 They're invisible.
3904870 3906700 What's wrong with you? They need nets!
3908910 3909750 Colette!
3909910 3911500 Wait, don't take off!
3913170 3914290 Dumbo...
3914460 3915420 Oh, boy!
3915590 3917170 ...Prince of the Elephants.
3919050 3921920 I command you to fly with me.
3952910 3954080 Colette!
3970180 3971600 Lower the platform!
3990620 3991950 Fly, little one!
4011470 4013140 Magic dust!
4041040 4042250 Where's my show?
4065070 4067150 The elephant's headed to Nightmare Island.
4087720 4089720 Come on, sweetie. Let's go.
4126670 4127670 Dumbo, it's okay.
4127840 4128970 We're here.
4130760 4131880 Good evening.
4132050 4132890 It's Mr. Vandevere.
4133050 4134300 -Hello, hi.<br />-Hey, that's V.A. Vandevere!
4134470 4135720 Everyone having fun?
4136260 4137430 Good.
4137600 4138680 -Having a good time?<br />-Yes, sir.
4139850 4140980 Fantastic.
4141350 4142980 Get him outta here.
4143650 4144980 -Yes.<br />-Over here!
4145150 4146400 -Folks, please.<br />-Hello.
4146570 4148230 Folks, I need you to leave the exhibit.
4149190 4150360 Come on.
4152240 4153860 Guys, guys, go easy,<br />he's just a baby.
4154030 4156370 Soldier, I give the orders here.
4164170 4165590 It's his bedtime.
4167960 4169710 <i>This attraction is now closed.</i>
4177060 4178060 Dad?
4180560 4182270 It's Mrs. Jumbo.
4188110 4191150 -Come on, I want to see Dumbo!<br />-I want to see Dumbo!
4191320 4192530 I want my money back!
4192690 4193950 I don't understand.
4194110 4195740 The elephant flies. You saw it.
4196240 4197870 I saw a vanishing act.
4198120 4201290 I'm not investing one cent<br />until I can see this works.
4201450 4203670 You can't control your animal.
4203830 4206080 You give me a little time, I can fix this.
4206250 4209420 Whatever! Till then, the bank is closed.
4214010 4216180 What happened up there?<br />You lost control of the animal.
4216340 4217350 You're the animal.
4217510 4218680 Where was my net?
4218850 4221100 Nets are for rehearsal.<br />This is the show.
4224020 4226100 Training?<br />You call that training?
4226270 4228820 Now, hold on, Mr. Vandevere,<br />we know why he flew away.
4228980 4230730 He recognized that other elephant's call.
4230900 4232820 The one on Nightmare Island.<br />It's his momma!
4232990 4234110 It's true. It's her.
4234280 4235910 She was sold from our circus two months ago.
4236070 4237320 Every child knows its mother.
4237490 4240080 And they say elephants never forget.
4240240 4241660 They can be together now.
4242200 4243870 Why are there children in my office?
4244040 4247830 Mr. Vandevere, please,<br />all Dumbo wants is his momma.
4248000 4250630 Just reunite them,<br />and he'll do whatever you want.
4250800 4253420 No, he'll do whatever she wants.
4253840 4257550 You think I'd have bought her if I thought<br />she was related to him?
4258850 4260470 Doesn't help me at all.
4265100 4267940 You wanna know the most important thing<br />about growing up?
4269520 4273820 You've got to learn to go it alone.
4276860 4279240 Get rid of the mother.<br />You know where to take her.
4279410 4280830 And treat yourself to some new boots.
4281240 4283160 But, sir, you can't just kill her.
4283750 4284790 Why not?
4284950 4286120 Mr. Vandevere.
4286290 4288460 Wait!<br />Don't separate 'em, please.
4288620 4290500 Don't do that to my kids.
4290670 4294460 You know, Holt, when my father left us,<br />it was a blessing really.
4294630 4297510 Because I had to learn<br />how to fend for myself.
4297680 4299640 Maybe that's what your children need.
4300140 4301220 Don't tell me what my children need.
4301390 4303140 Best take a step back, Elephant Man.
4305270 4306810 Darling...
4306980 4311060 Dumbo and his mom need a little alone time.
4311230 4313400 So, Mommy's going to take a little trip...
4313570 4315740 so that Dumbo won't be distracted.
4318360 4319240 Milly!
4319410 4320990 Milly!
4333960 4335050 Colette?
4336760 4338130 I have rehearsal.
4339680 4340720 Max.
4346220 4347270 <i>Nightmare Island.</i>
4347430 4348430 Milly?
4348600 4350940 <i>Home of the most dangerous beasts<br />in the world.</i>
4351100 4352690 Sir, park's closing.
4359900 4361030 Milly!
4365030 4366040 Milly!
4371210 4372960 Did you find her?
4373670 4374710 No.
4377710 4381630 Well, her momma always knew what to say.<br />No matter what.
4381800 4383050 She always knew.
4384010 4386930 Your children don't need you to be perfect.
4387390 4389730 They just need you to believe in them.
4391310 4392900 That simple, huh?
4399240 4402530 All right, well,<br />I'm gonna keep looking.
4423510 4426140 That's my daughter all right.
4426300 4429270 The only girl I know<br />who runs away to go to school.
4430480 4432100 It's our fault.
4432270 4434560 Bet Dumbo wishes he never met us.
4434730 4437150 You showed him he could fly.
4437320 4439230 You think he'd ever trade that?
4440110 4442150 He would to have his mom back.
4447530 4449080 I miss Momma.
4450950 4452620 Yeah, so do I.
4456380 4458380 There's something I want to show you.
4459710 4462510 <i>With advances in both<br />engineering and medicine...</i>
4462670 4465180 <i>the human and the mechanical<br />will soon be combined...</i>
4465340 4468510 <i>to assist ordinary families, workers<br />and veterans.</i>
4468680 4473690 <i>All kinds of technological marvels<br />await us in the 20th century.</i>
4474310 4476520 You're gonna do great things.
4477770 4478770 I know it.
4489660 4490950 What's this?
4491120 4492290 Give me a break.
4492450 4495540 I gotta teach you how to read English, too?
4500750 4502510 Oh, Max, hello!
4503670 4505590 Good, you brought the paperwork.
4505760 4506800 Max...
4507800 4510050 I was reviewing your troupe...
4510560 4511560 and to be honest with you...
4511720 4514930 they're really pale imitations<br />from the acts we already have.
4515100 4518350 So I was thinking, I don't know,<br />a month's severance? Seems fair.
4518520 4519940 <i>Capisce?</i>
4521360 4523150 I thought you promised to...
4523320 4526070 Max, the contract says that I'd hire them.
4526240 4528070 It never stipulated for how long.
4528240 4531240 So, get your little band of low-rent freaks<br />out of here.
4531410 4534700 But they're my troupe.<br />They're countin' on me.
4534870 4537210 Okay, let's have a heart.
4537370 4539210 Why don't you tell them?
4550760 4554180 ‘Bout time, boss.<br />So, when do we start?
4565230 4566690 What's going on, guys?
4566860 4568740 Vandevere's fired them all.
4568910 4570990 They're to leave by tomorrow.
4583670 4586010 Goodbye, little friend.
4586630 4588220 Goodbye.
4590470 4593220 We wanted to see him one last time.
4593390 4595770 One last time to see him fly.
4596890 4598690 I don't think he wants to anymore.
4599310 4601150 Oh, no. But he must.
4601310 4603900 He cannot lose Mrs. Jumbo again!
4604070 4606940 I'm afraid it's rather worse than that.
4607400 4608530 Mr. Sotheby?
4609070 4611070 I've come to clear my conscience.
4611990 4614660 I resigned my position as soon<br />as I heard him give the order.
4614830 4616240 What order?
4617200 4620120 Mrs. Jumbo will be gone by tomorrow night.
4620290 4622130 And she's not meant to survive.
4637850 4639930 This "Dreamland" doesn't deserve him.
4640440 4642350 No circus does.
4654280 4658620 Well, who's gonna be willing to help me?
4660960 4663290 Set Dumbo and his momma free.
4691530 4696490 <i>Welcome to the Colosseum,<br />where the impossible is possible.</i>
4698790 4701410 Okay. Second time's the charm.
4701580 4704920 Let's see if Dream Daddy's<br />worked out the kinks.
4705080 4706960 <i>Here to pick up the elephant<br />from Nightmare Island?</i>
4707130 4708040 Confirmed.
4708210 4709840 Unlock the back gates.
4732860 4734400 Dumbo in position!
4735660 4738660 Soon as he flies, you run back to his tent<br />and I'll find you there.
4738950 4740160 All right, Big D.
4741620 4743830 It's all up to you now.
4745370 4746620 Come on, Holt!
4756680 4758180 To hell with it.
4762770 4764680 Ready for positions.
4764850 4767020 We could have used a little rehearsal.
4767190 4768520 Rehearsal?
4768690 4771190 Think we got a rehearsal<br />at the Battle of the Argonne?
4772190 4773990 You sure you can do this?
4774150 4775860 I fly elephants all the time.
4777030 4778740 Are you sure you can do this?
4779660 4781530 With one hand tied behind my back.
4794260 4796760 Wait. What's that?
4798220 4799340 Ma'am?
4801010 4802060 Ma'am?
4802970 4804890 Sorry, ma'am, attraction's closed.
4805060 4808190 My dream... to be a mermaid...
4808350 4810610 and now they've taken it away.
4810770 4813150 And yet I hear the water singing.
4813320 4814650 I hear them beckoning me home.
4814820 4816780 Lady, just be careful, okay?
4816940 4819160 -Return me to the vast abyss!<br />-Let's go.
4819320 4821700 -My destiny, the sea!<br />-Okay.
4871120 4872290 We've lost power!
4872460 4873790 Even the cages?
4873960 4875420 But the animals...
4877090 4878920 Find the breakers. Get the lights back on!
4879550 4881380 And make sure those cages are locked.

5023900 5026070 Where is your circus of freaks?
5028450 5029780 What's going on?
5029950 5032080 The elephant's mother is gone!
5032240 5034580 His troupe's behind it!
5035080 5037040 Alert the tower and secure the gates.
5037710 5039540 Don't let them get out.
5041090 5042880 But why would they only take the one?
5044260 5047180 Keep your eye on Farrier and those kids.
5047340 5048930 You! Come with us.
5063320 5064530 There they are!
5066570 5067650 Hey!
5077580 5079000 Hey, you!
5079170 5080460 What are you doing up there?
5080630 5082420 That's private property.
5082590 5084090 Come on! Get down here!
5084250 5085340 Now!
5085510 5088760 Hey, I'm Max Medici, Vandevere's partner.
5089050 5092600 He's just a maintenance man fixing a light!<br />Get back to your posts!
5092760 5094560 Yes, sir, Mr. Medici.
5109490 5111320 Let's try this again.
5111490 5112910 You and me.
5128420 5129630 Hey, the kids?
5129800 5130800 Where are the kids?
5130970 5132050 Hey, have you seen the kids?
5132220 5136220 Dumbo, Prince of the Elephants!
5136390 5139430 I command you to fly with me.
5154570 5156990 Dumbo, please fly.
5157950 5159580 Do it for your momma.
5214720 5215840 Where's your father?
5230070 5230900 Dumbo!
5243290 5245120 Hey! Get those kids!
5248250 5249540 Dumbo!
5282620 5283660 Come on.

5307100 5308350 Just passing through!
5310020 5311310 Hey! You can't do that!
5314190 5315690 Get the elephant!
5315860 5316990 You get the elephant!
5338930 5342100 Don't worry. Dad'll be here soon.
5342260 5343680 Where's the elephant?
5350020 5352610 Why are you just standing there?<br />Get to the tower!
5352770 5355110 Electricity's failing! There's no elevators!
5355270 5357860 When I last checked,<br />they invented stairs.
5359110 5362570 <i>We seem to be experiencing<br />some technical difficulties.</i>
5377130 5379590 What happened to my power?
5380590 5382260 What power, <i>mon chéri?</i>
5382430 5383930 You ungrateful...
5384100 5387350 You were nothing before I made you my...
5387890 5390480 I believe the word is "queen."
5392310 5394060 I need lights!
5396820 5397940 Mr. Vandevere, wait!
5398110 5400360 We have to reset the mains,<br />or you could cause a surge!
5400530 5401740 Right now it's impossible!
5401900 5403910 Nothing's impossible!
5406080 5407080 Mr. Vandevere!
5413420 5414960 Mr. Vandevere, stop!
5440570 5442320 Milly! Joe!
5451290 5453080 Come on. Go!<br />Come on!
5479900 5480900 Get everyone out!
5481070 5483070 Evacuate the park!
5487280 5488780 Milly! Joe!
5502130 5503130 Hey!
5509300 5510930 Where is the elephant?
5511100 5512350 Let her go!
5529870 5530870 Come on!
5531030 5532160 Milly! Joe!
5532330 5533580 Dad!
5533750 5535290 -You all right? All right?<br />-We're fine.
5535460 5536830 Okay, come on.<br />All right, cover your faces.
5537000 5539040 Give me your hand!<br />Come on!
5539210 5539880 Back!
5542210 5543460 Stay close.
5552680 5553890 Come on, everybody.
5554060 5556180 Let's get to the seaport!<br />Now!
5556680 5558850 -Where are the Farriers?<br />-They must still be inside.
5591590 5592510 Dad!
5593470 5594640 It's okay, Joe.
5596430 5597480 Come here. Come here.
5600310 5610410 Dumbo!
5610570 5611660 Come on!
5612410 5614700 -Go! Go! Go! Go!<br />-Jump!
5615160 5616660 Come on. Come on.
5624750 5626250 -All right, let's go.<br />-Stay close, come on.
5629260 5630430 Okay. Go! Go! Go!
5630590 5632010 Come on!
5632890 5634100 -Dumbo!<br />-Come on!
5635100 5636310 Dumbo! What's wrong?
5636470 5638350 Guys! Milly! Joe! Come on!
5638520 5639680 Dumbo, let's go!
5643860 5644860 Go!
5650030 5651450 Dumbo!
5651610 5653320 Get him!
5653490 5655620 He's seen us.<br />Dumbo, you gotta go.
5655780 5657160 They're comin' for you.<br />You gotta go, Dumbo.
5657330 5658410 He lost the feather.
5658580 5661330 Feather doesn't do nothin'.<br />Dumbo, you don't need the feather to fly.
5661870 5663420 Dad, they're coming!
5664170 5665630 Stand back! Stand back!
5665790 5666790 Out of my way!
5669010 5670920 Dumbo, remember this?
5671090 5673050 From my momma?
5673220 5676930 I can unlock any door.<br />And you can, too.
5677930 5679470 But I don't need this key to do it.
5679640 5680930 And you don't need the feather.
5682440 5683270 Come on.
5698660 5699580 Dad!
5699740 5700830 Gotta go. Come on!
5702910 5705000 -What are you doing?<br />-There ain't room for the three of us.
5705170 5706880 You get him to the seaport<br />and I'll see you there.
5707340 5708540 Go on, Big D.
5714930 5716050 Grab 'em!
5716220 5717220 Hey!

5744370 5745960 Come on, let's go!
5749040 5750290 Hey! Get back here!
5753630 5755300 You freak!<br />What have you done?
5755720 5757010 What they pay me for, mister.
5757180 5758640 Put on a hell of a show.
5762220 5763430 Hey! Him!
5763600 5765640 Right there, arrest that man.<br />He stole my elephant.
5765810 5767560 Hey, we had a contract, Medici!
5768020 5771230 I'm no expert,<br />but I think you got bigger problems here.
5783040 5785250 Wow. This is a disaster.
5786370 5787750 Come on, I'll buy you a hot dog.
5787920 5789880 Sounds good, J.G.

5876710 5878630 I knew you could ride.
5884850 5887020 -Pramesh, we have to go.<br />-Please, hurry.
