129828 131538 Are you here to kill me?
140217 141920 I know what this is.
143700 145538 I have seen one before.
146521 148369 Many, many years ago.
150875 155098 It belonged to a man I met<br />in a half-remembered dream.
157486 158438 A man...
158665 162065 possessed of some radical notions.
166331 168610 What is the most resilient parasite?
169640 170729 A bacteria?
171554 172413 A virus?
173836 175062 An intestinal worm?
176558 178133 What Mr. Cobb is trying to say...
178158 178946 An idea.
180871 182852 Resilient. Highly contagious.
183462 187558 Once an idea has taken hold of the brain<br />it's almost impossible to eradicate.
188027 191706 An idea that is fully formed,<br />fully understood, that sticks.
192273 193531 Right in there somewhere.
193605 195413 For someone like you to steal?
195617 198564 Yes. In the dream state,<br />your conscious defenses are lowered
198589 201036 and that makes your thoughts,<br />vulnerable to theft.
201403 202643 It's called extraction.
202937 206511 Mr. Saito, we can train<br />your subconscious to defend itself,
206535 209178 from even the most skilled extractor.
209220 210393 How can you do that?
210680 212824 Because I am the most skilled extractor.
213741 216234 I know how to search your<br />mind and find your secrets.
216289 217452 I know the tricks.
217477 220025 And I can teach them to you,<br />so that even when you are asleep,
220256 222632 your defense, is never down.
223596 225012 Look if you want my help,
225719 227684 you are gonna have to be<br />completely open with me.
227709 230592 I need to know my way around your<br />thoughts better than your wife,
230617 232861 better than your therapist,<br />better than anyone.
234241 236526 If this is a dream,<br />and you have a safe full of secrets.
236551 238558 I need to know what's in that safe.
239197 242543 In order for this all to work,<br />you need to completely let me in.
245680 247068 Enjoy your evening gentlemen,
247568 249485 as I consider your proposal.
252882 253930 He knows.
256969 258219 What's going on up there?
312648 313754 Saito knows.
314109 315332 He is playing with us.
315667 318036 Doesn't matter.<br />I can get it here, trust me.
318342 319844 The information is in the safe.
319869 321837 He looked right at it<br />when I mentioned secrets.
323549 324584 What's she doing here?
327520 328733 Just head back to the room.
328863 330168 Alright? I will take care of this.
330193 332191 Ok, make sure you do.<br />We are here to work.
340736 341897 If I jumped...
343560 344858 would I survive?
348015 349386 With a clean dive, perhaps.
350647 352035 Mal, what are you doing here?
352144 353941 I thought you might be missing me.
354827 355953 You know that I am.
357631 359740 But, I can't trust you anymore.
360686 361670 So what?
363567 365131 Looks like Arthur's taste.
366140 369158 Actually the subject is partial<br />to postwar British painters.
371267 372838 Please, have a seat.
380843 381718 Tell me...
382537 384095 Do the children miss me?
388505 389834 You can't imagine.
394323 395256 What are you doing?
395335 396859 Just getting some fresh air.
397651 398987 Stay where you are Mal.
412890 414221 Goddammit.
476753 477951 Turn around.
478652 479676 The gun Dom.
488830 489785 Please.
501872 504032 Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.
504679 505915 Did she tell you?
506663 508132 Or have you known all along?
508651 510915 That you are here to steal from me or,
511196 513655 that we are actually asleep?
517325 519691 I want to know the name of your employer.
521976 525437 There is no use threatening him<br />in a dream, right Mal?
526333 528133 That depends on what you are threatening.
529515 531250 Killing him would just wake him up.
532405 533320 But pain...
537643 538966 Pain is in the mind.
540206 541553 And judging by the decor.
541577 543572 We are in your mind,<br />are not we Arthur?
555797 557105 What are you doing it's too soon.
557130 558817 I know, but the dream is collapsing.
559033 561059 I am gonna try to keep Saito<br />under a little bit longer.
561778 562692 We are almost there.
576584 577756 He was close.
578968 579975 Very close.
594769 595786 Stop him!
622461 623890 This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.
645348 646464 He won't wake.
651669 652966 Give him the kick.<br />What?
653583 654521 Sunk him.
699146 700013 He is out.
705775 706935 You came prepared?
708086 710656 Not even my head of security knows<br />this apartment.
710680 711920 How did you find it?
712667 716593 It's very difficult for a man of your<br />position to keep a love nest like this secret
716657 718882 particularly where there is<br />a married woman involved.
718906 719945 She would never...
719970 721154 Yet, here we are.
722117 723117 With a dilemma.
723206 724421 They are getting closer.
724579 727085 You got what you came for.<br />Well, that's not true.
727507 730169 You left out a key piece<br />of information, didn't you?
730327 732891 You held something back because<br />you knew what we were up to.
733689 735499 Question is why did you let us in at all?
735547 736604 An audition.
737584 738618 An audition for what?
738643 740427 Doesn't matter. You failed.
740981 743677 We extracted every bit of<br />information you had in there.
743927 745931 But your deception was obvious.
787261 787817 So...
788312 789567 leave me and go.
789896 791716 You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.
791771 793695 That corporation that hired us,
794114 795763 they won't accept failure.
796270 797880 We won't last two days.
800253 800997 Cobb?
801551 803754 Looks like I am gonna have to do this<br />a little more simply.
805012 806252 Tell us what you know!
806541 808450 Tell us what you know, now!
812003 814345 I have always hated this carpet.
815656 816637 It's stained...
816917 819721 and frayed in such distinctive ways.
820857 823350 But very definitely made of wool.
824989 826107 Right now,
827756 829639 I am lying on polyester.
833937 834947 Which means,
835907 838863 I am not lying on my carpet,<br />in my apartment.
839870 842435 You have lived up to your reputation.<br />Mr. Cobb.
843449 845308 I am still dreaming.
852180 853798 How did it go?<br />Not good.
859437 860862 Dream within a dream?
862186 863356 I am impressed.
864809 865920 But in my dream,
866927 868506 you play by my rules.
868557 870584 Yes, but you see Mr. Saito,
870908 872307 We are not in your dream.
872332 873326 We are in mine.
884089 884872 Asshole.
884896 886011 How do you mess up the carpet?
886081 887261 It was not my fault.
887337 888594 You are the architect.
888619 890558 I didn't know he was gonna<br />rub his cheek on it!
890707 891526 That's enough.
893135 893798 You.
893961 895070 What the hell was all that?
895469 896597 I have it under control.
896622 898075 I would hate to see you out of control.
898504 899825 We don't have time for this.
900543 902012 I am getting off at Kyoto.
902325 904156 He has not gonna check every compartment.
904444 905647 Yeah, well. I don't like trains.
905761 906519 Listen.
906941 908248 Every man for himself.
983090 983995 Yes, hello?
984208 985014 <i>Hi Daddy.</i>
985241 986464 <i>Hi Dad.</i>
987383 988484 Hey, guys. Hey.
989229 990720 How are you? How you doing?
991217 993063 <i>Good. Ok, I guess.</i>
993657 994485 Ok?
995618 997528 Who is just ok? Is that you James?
997804 998402 <i>Yeah.</i>
999051 1000996 <i>When are you coming home, Dad?</i>
1002498 1004496 Well. I can't sweetheart, I can't.
1005306 1006957 Not for a while, remember?
1007209 1007977 <i>Why?</i>
1009056 1009663 Look.
1010212 1011916 I told you, I am away,
1011940 1013657 because I am working, right?
1014890 1016663 <i>Grandma says you are never coming back.</i>
1018307 1019460 Phillipa, is that you?
1021334 1023155 Put Grandma on the phone for me, will you?
1023719 1024922 <i>She is shaking her head.</i>
1027486 1029312 Well, I just hope she is wrong about that.
1030786 1031686 <i>Daddy?</i>
1032820 1033686 Yeah. James?
1034061 1035413 <i>Is Mommy with you?</i>
1038326 1039925 James, we talked about this.
1041774 1043636 Mommy is not here anymore.
1045085 1046058 <i>Where?</i>
1048421 1049453 <i>That's enough, kids.</i>
1050077 1050999 <i>Say bye-bye.</i>
1051024 1054335 Listen. I am gonna send some presents<br />with Grandpa, alright?
1054360 1055400 And you be good, you be...
1065659 1067362 Our ride is on the roof.<br />Right.
1075348 1076273 Hey, are you ok?
1076898 1078312 Yeah. Yeah. I am fine. Why?
1078452 1079692 Well, down in the dream.
1079904 1081074 Mal showing up.
1081321 1082111 Look. I am...
1082272 1083404 sorry about your leg.
1083428 1084552 Won't happen again.
1084624 1085671 It's getting worse, isn't it?
1085696 1087500 One apology is all you are getting, alright?
1088276 1089201 Where is Nash?
1089226 1090805 He has not shown. You wanna wait?
1091036 1093504 We were supposed to deliver<br />Saito's expansion plans
1093571 1095034 to COBOL Engineering two hours ago.
1095105 1096571 By now, they know we failed.
1097019 1098485 It's time we disappear.
1099269 1100422 Where you gonna go?
1100764 1101862 Buenos Aires.
1102071 1105171 I can lie low there, maybe sniff out<br />a job when things quiet down.
1105757 1107071 You?<br />Stateside.
1107871 1108954 Send my regards.
1115573 1116663 He sold you out.
1116937 1119233 Thought to come to me<br />and bargain for his life.
1120918 1123153 So, I offer you the satisfaction.
1127000 1128625 It's not the way I deal with things.
1141615 1142794 What will you do with him?
1143311 1144162 Nothing.
1145267 1147526 But I can't speak for COBOL Engineering.
1162202 1163406 What do you want from us?
1164339 1165148 Inception.
1166905 1167905 Is it possible?
1167929 1168913 Of course not.
1169374 1171569 If you can steal an idea<br />from someone is mind,
1171695 1173710 why can't you plant one there instead?
1173734 1176073 Ok, here is me planting<br />an idea in your head.
1176098 1178040 I say you. Don't think about elephants.
1178064 1179197 What are you thinking about?
1179719 1180898 Elephants.<br />Right.
1180923 1182127 But it's not your idea.
1182151 1183795 Because you know I gave it to you.
1184033 1187197 The subject's mind can always trace<br />the genesis of the idea.
1187222 1189884 True inspiration is impossible to fake.<br />That's not true.
1192852 1193806 Can you do it?
1193876 1195439 Are you offering me a choice?
1196436 1198908 Because I can find my own way<br />to square things with COBOL.
1198933 1200408 Then you do have a choice.
1201145 1202676 Then I choose to leave, sir.
1208093 1209788 Tell the crew where you want to go.
1214869 1215927 Hey, Mr. Cobb.
1219032 1220613 How would you like to go home?
1221828 1222791 To America.
1223697 1224837 To your children.
1225853 1227131 You can't fix that.
1227572 1228720 No one can.
1229069 1230634 Just like inception.
1230794 1231966 Cobb, come on.
1236043 1237606 How complex is the idea?
1237809 1238968 Simple enough.
1239112 1242639 No idea is simple, when you need<br />to plant it in somebody else's mind.
1243143 1246197 My main competitor<br />is an old man in poor health.
1246876 1250088 His son will soon inherit control<br />of the corporation.
1251648 1255009 I need him to decide to break up<br />his father's empire.
1255820 1257835 Cobb, we should walk away from this.<br />Hold on.
1260501 1261748 If I were to do this...
1262141 1263532 If I even could do it,
1263837 1265454 I would need a guarantee.
1266032 1267638 How do I know you can deliver?
1267762 1268727 You don't.
1269776 1270826 But I can.
1271845 1272638 So...
1273920 1275935 do you want to take a leap of faith,
1276850 1278443 or become an old man.
1279392 1280684 Filled with regret,
1280965 1282743 waiting to die alone?
1286650 1288233 Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
1288569 1290467 And choose your people more wisely.
1299336 1300945 I know how much you wanna go home.
1303577 1304882 This can't be done.
1305479 1306601 Yes, it can.
1307721 1309814 Just have to go deep enough.<br />You don't know that.
1311974 1313228 I have done it before.
1315089 1316260 Who did you do it to?
1321261 1322618 Why are we going to Paris?
1324997 1326579 We are gonna need a new architect.
1343591 1345511 You never did like your office, did you?
1347478 1349852 No space to think in that broom cupboard.
1352337 1354172 Is it safe for you to be here?
1356126 1358273 Extradition between France<br />and the United States,
1358298 1360107 is a bureaucratic nightmare,<br />you know that.
1360341 1363220 I think they might find a way<br />to make it work in your case.
1363353 1364271 Look, I...
1365084 1368310 brought these for you to give<br />to the kids when you have a chance.
1368490 1371130 It will take more than<br />the occasional stuffed animal,
1371294 1373724 to convince those children<br />they still have a father.
1374181 1376693 I am just doing what I know.<br />I am doing what you taught me.
1377184 1378884 I never taught you to be a thief.
1378885 1381253 No, you taught me<br />to navigate people's minds.
1381254 1382551 But after what happened...
1382723 1385986 there were not a whole lot of legitimate<br />ways for me to use that skill.
1391431 1392921 What are you doing here, Dom?
1395035 1396842 I think I found a way home.
1397819 1399511 It's a job for some very,
1400061 1401498 very powerful people.
1401525 1405561 People who I believe,<br />can fix my charges permanently.
1406803 1408101 But I need your help.
1408582 1411881 You are here to corrupt<br />one of my brightest and best.
1412052 1414953 You know what I am offering.<br />Let them decide for themselves.
1415122 1416589 Money.<br />Not just money.
1416757 1417788 You remember.
1418354 1419072 It's,
1419393 1421047 the chance to build cathedrals.
1421072 1423424 Entire cities things that never existed,
1423597 1426424 things that could not<br />exist in the real world.
1426967 1429534 So, you want me to let someone else,
1430347 1432156 follow you into your fantasy?
1432305 1434588 They don't actually come into the dream,<br />they just...
1434612 1437442 they just design the levels<br />and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.
1437878 1439106 Design it yourself.
1441782 1442911 Mal won't let me.
1449489 1451119 Come back to reality Dom.
1452959 1453760 Please.
1454272 1455232 Reality.
1455896 1456857 Those kids,
1457463 1458695 your grandchildren,
1458719 1462271 they are waiting for their father<br />to come back home, that's their reality.
1462769 1464993 And this job, this last job.
1465193 1466481 That's how I get there.
1466662 1470139 I would not be standing here<br />if I knew any other way.
1473586 1475926 I need an architect<br />who is as good as I was.
1480573 1482153 I have got somebody better.
1482830 1483854 Ariadne?
1486343 1488275 I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.
1489162 1490254 Pleased to meet you.
1490603 1491728 If you have a few moments,
1491752 1495094 Mr. Cobb has a job offer<br />he would like to discuss with you.
1495486 1496510 A work placement?
1496703 1497759 Not exactly.
1498358 1499689 I have a test for you.
1500497 1502396 You are not gonna tell me anything first?
1502771 1505387 Before I describe the job.<br />I have to know you can do it.
1505448 1506239 Why?
1506439 1508591 It's not, strictly speaking legal.
1511741 1512457 You have,
1512714 1513583 two minutes,
1513801 1516297 to design a maze<br />that it takes one minute to solve.
1518191 1519000 Stop.
1521761 1522607 Again.
1525098 1525929 Stop.
1529892 1531337 You are gonna have to do better than that.
1544684 1545946 That's more like it.
1566439 1569447 They say we only use a fraction<br />of our brain's true potential.
1569472 1571022 Now, that's when we are awake.
1571077 1572476 When we are asleep.
1572500 1574140 Our mind can do almost anything.
1574214 1575238 Such as?
1575522 1577326 So imagine you are designing a building,
1577351 1579443 You consciously create each aspect.
1579819 1582338 But sometimes, it feels like it's almost<br />creating itself,
1582362 1583428 if you know what I mean.<br />Yeak.
1583590 1584488 Yeah, like I am...
1584980 1585822 discovering it.
1585847 1587824 Genuine inspiration, right?
1588004 1589409 Now in a dream.
1589636 1592412 Our mind continuously does this.<br />We...
1592748 1596811 create and perceive<br />our world simultaneously.
1596836 1599825 And our mind does this so well<br />that we don't even know it's happening.
1600365 1603518 That allows us to get right<br />in the middle of that process.
1603543 1605763 How?<br />By taking over the creating part.
1605788 1607305 Now, this is where I need you.
1607306 1609475 You create the world of the dream.
1609816 1611932 We bring the subject into that dream.
1612487 1614526 And they fill it with their subconscious.
1615097 1616311 How could I ever...
1616674 1620096 acquire enough detail<br />to make them think that it's reality?
1620333 1621650 Well, dreams...
1621955 1624072 they feel real<br />while we are in them, right?
1624135 1627933 So it's only when we wake up that<br />we realize something was actually strange.
1629002 1630564 Let me ask you a question.<br />You...
1630808 1631743 you never really,
1631891 1634064 remember the<br />beginning of a dream, do you?
1634140 1635288 You always wind up,
1635312 1637166 right in the middle of what's going on.
1637406 1638430 I guess, yeah.
1638724 1640198 So how did we end up here?
1640645 1642121 Well, we just came from the...
1642985 1645847 Think about it. Ariadne.<br />How did you get here?
1646820 1648269 Where are you right now?
1652141 1653185 We are dreaming?
1653210 1656032 You are in the middle of the workshop,<br />right now, sleeping.
1656087 1658538 This is your first lesson in shared dreaming.
1658563 1659655 Stay calm.
1696433 1698560 If it's just a dream. Then why are you...
1699671 1701604 Because it's never just a dream, is it?
1701776 1704232 And a face full of glass hurts like hell.<br />When you are in it,
1704839 1705797 it feels real.
1705822 1708658 That's why the military developed<br />dream sharing it was a training program,
1708683 1712566 for soldiers to shoot stab and strangle<br />each other and then wake up.
1713086 1714883 How did architects become involved?
1715055 1717393 Well, someone had to design<br />the dreams, right?
1719071 1720829 Why don't you give us<br />another five minutes?
1721428 1722520 Five minutes?
1723379 1724172 What...
1724403 1726305 We were talking for like at least an hour.
1726544 1729883 In a dream, your mind<br />functions more quickly therefore...
1730131 1731920 time seems to feel more slow.
1732015 1734568 Five minutes in the real world<br />gives you an hour in the dream.
1736049 1738576 Why don't you see what you<br />can get up to in five minutes?
1744884 1746358 You have got the basic layout.
1746714 1748206 Bookstore, cafe.
1748308 1749798 Almost everything else is here too.
1750174 1752901 Who are the people?<br />Projections of my subconscious.
1752926 1754268 Yours?<br />Yes.
1754510 1756785 Remember, you are the dreamer.<br />You build this world.
1756963 1758119 I am the subject.
1758143 1759625 My mind populates it.
1759799 1760789 You can literally...
1760957 1762148 talk to my subconscious.
1762173 1764776 That's one of the ways we extract<br />information from the subject.
1764801 1766063 How else do you do it?
1766406 1768505 By creating something secure.<br />Like a...
1769077 1770518 like a bank vault or a jail.
1770543 1774274 The mind automatically fills it<br />with information it's trying to protect.
1774447 1775540 You understand?
1775657 1777211 Then you break in and steal it?
1777383 1778259 Well...
1778585 1779683 I guess I thought that...
1780275 1782689 the dream space would be<br />all about the visual but...
1783256 1784870 it's more about the feel of it.
1785592 1789300 My question is, what happens when you<br />start messing with the physics of it all?
1831070 1832527 It's something, isn't it?
1833740 1834832 Yes, it is.
1859177 1860575 Why are they all looking at me?
1860667 1864333 Because my subconscious feels that<br />someone else is creating this world.
1864483 1865977 The more you change things,
1866001 1868475 the quicker the projections start<br />to converge on you.
1868745 1869803 Converge?
1870043 1872102 They sense the foreign nature<br />of the dreamer.
1872278 1875138 They attack, like white blood cells<br />fighting an infection.
1875223 1876654 What, they are gonna attack us?
1876786 1877583 No.
1878603 1879505 Just you.
1884568 1887536 This is great, but I am telling you.<br />If you keep changing things like this...
1892021 1894803 Jeez, mind telling your subconscious<br />to take it easy?
1895010 1897672 It's my subconscious.<br />Remember? I can't control it.
1951224 1952589 Very impressive.
1964337 1965577 I know this bridge.
1966586 1967988 This place is real, isn't it?
1968186 1970518 Yeah. I cross it every day<br />to get to the college.
1970644 1974158 Never re-create places from your memory.<br />Always imagine new places.
1974217 1976048 You draw from stuff you know, right?
1976149 1977505 Only use details...
1977790 1979318 A streetlamp<br />or a phone booth.
1979342 1981283 Never entire areas.<br />Why not?
1981389 1983158 Because building a dream from your memory
1983183 1986436 is the easiest way to lose your grasp<br />on what's real and what is a dream.
1986492 1988350 Is that what happened to you?<br />Listen to me.
1988531 1990335 This has nothing to do with me, understand?
1990615 1992583 That why you need me to build your dreams?
1993032 1994230 Hey, get off of her.
1994254 1995764 Back up. Back up.<br />Hey!
1995789 1997512 Cobb! Cobb!<br />Get off of her!
1997537 1999471 Let me go! Let me go!<br />Mal!
1999972 2001956 Cobb! Wake me up!<br />Mal!
2001981 2004097 Wake me up! Wake me up!<br />Mal! No!
2004210 2006124 Let me go! Let me go!<br />Mal, no! No!
2007440 2009495 Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
2009519 2011014 You are ok. You are ok.
2011484 2012540 Hey.<br />Why...
2013015 2014225 Why would not I wake up?
2015335 2016968 There was still time on the clock.
2017210 2019155 You can't wake up from<br />within the dream unless you die.
2019492 2021084 She will need a totem.<br />What?
2021403 2022870 A totem, it's a small personal...
2022895 2025420 That's some subconscious<br />you have got on you, Cobb!
2025598 2027213 She is a real charmer.
2027924 2029182 I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
2029206 2030228 She is his wife?
2030403 2031935 Yeah. So a totem.
2032371 2034660 You need a small object, potentially heavy.
2034817 2037112 Something you can have on you<br />that no one else knows.
2037137 2038338 Like a coin?<br />No.
2038456 2040193 It needs to be more unique than that, like...
2040677 2041527 this is a...
2041855 2042863 loaded die.
2045136 2047192 I can't let you touch it.<br />That would defeat the purpose.
2047217 2051136 Dee, only I know the balance and<br />the weight of this particular loaded die.
2051703 2053534 That way.<br />When you look at your totem...
2053559 2056044 you know beyond a doubt that<br />you are not in someone else's dream.
2060099 2061103 I-I-I-I don't know,
2061231 2063132 if you can't see what's going on,
2063156 2064559 or if you just don't want to...
2064722 2068249 but Cobb has some serious problems<br />that he has tried to bury down there.
2068367 2069639 And I am not about to just,
2069811 2071182 open my mind,
2071206 2072451 to someone like that.
2078351 2079313 She will be back.
2079726 2082276 I have never seen anyone pick<br />it up that quickly before.
2082421 2085797 Reality is not gonna be enough for her now.<br />And when she comes back...
2087399 2089763 When she comes back.<br />You are gonna have her building mazes.
2089976 2092130 Where are you gonna be?<br />I got to go visit Eames.
2092365 2093318 Eames?
2093672 2094872 No, he is in Mombasa.
2094896 2095943 It's Cobol's back yard.
2096068 2097536 It's a necessary risk.
2097670 2099110 Well, there is plenty of good thieves.
2099234 2100779 We don't just need a thief.
2102041 2103146 We need a forger.
2112010 2114570 Rub them together all you want.<br />They are not gonna breed.
2115116 2116140 You never know.
2117115 2118386 I am gonna get you a drink.
2121093 2122126 You are buying.
2129060 2131258 Your spelling has not improved.<br />Piss off.
2131404 2132802 How is your handwriting?
2133539 2135224 It's versatile.<br />Good.
2135541 2136606 Thank you very much.
2137443 2138408 Inception.
2139045 2140126 Now, before you...
2140602 2142247 bother telling me it's impossible,
2142248 2143713 No, it's perfectly possible.
2143737 2145141 It's just bloody difficult.
2145695 2146549 Interesting.
2146901 2149111 Because Arthur keeps<br />telling me it can't be done.
2149922 2150803 Arthur.
2150997 2152291 You still working<br />with that stick in the mud?
2152316 2154011 He is good at what he does, right?
2154227 2156286 Oh, he is the best.<br />But he has no imagination.
2156462 2157486 Not like you.
2157511 2160480 Listen, if you are gonna perform inception.<br />You need imagination.
2160682 2162228 Let me ask you something.
2163018 2164307 Have you done it before?
2164537 2165635 We tried it.
2165869 2168190 We got the idea in place.<br />But it didn't take.
2168393 2169909 You didn't plant it deep enough?
2170033 2171699 No, it's not just about depth, you know.
2172170 2174118 You need the simplest version of the idea
2174142 2176460 in order for it to grow<br />naturally in your subject's mind.
2176484 2177623 It's a subtle art.
2177951 2180476 So, what is this idea<br />that you need to plant?
2180662 2181876 We need the heir of...
2181900 2184751 a major corporation<br />to dissolve his father's empire.
2184989 2187423 Right there you have<br />various political motivations...
2187448 2189529 and anti-monopolistic sentiments<br />and so forth.
2189554 2191085 But all of that stuff, it's...
2191842 2194415 It's really at the mercy of your<br />subject's prejudice, you see?
2194780 2197271 What you have to do is<br />start at the absolute basic.
2197403 2198540 Which is what?
2199472 2200959 The relationship with the father.
2203661 2205386 Do you have a chemist?<br />No, not yet.
2205411 2207306 Right. Ok, well.<br />There is a man here.
2207967 2209342 Yusuf. He...
2210032 2212456 He formulates his own versions<br />of the compounds.
2212671 2213777 Why don't you take me there?
2213802 2215034 Once you have lost your tail.
2216300 2217271 The man at the bar.
2217433 2218523 COBOL Engineering.
2218591 2221136 That price on my head.<br />Was that dead or alive?
2221339 2222219 Don't remember.
2222315 2223446 Let's see if he starts shooting.
2223796 2226838 Run interference, I will meet you<br />downstairs in the bar in, say...
2227040 2228381 half an hour?<br />Back here?
2228405 2230024 This is the last place they would suspect.
2232138 2232935 Alright.
2234640 2235388 Freddy?
2235745 2236804 Freddy Simmonds.
2236829 2238296 My God, it's you, isn't it?
2241647 2242705 No, it isn't you.
2243303 2244693 Not dreaming now, are you?
2246519 2247631 Get him!
2263636 2264506 There!
2284331 2285042 Cafe.
2285428 2286174 One-one cafe.
2298239 2299054 One cafe.
2300673 2301468 One cafe.
2357002 2358469 Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?
2360041 2361389 What are you doing in Mombasa?
2361413 2363434 I am here to protect my investment.
2367600 2369340 So this is your idea of losing a tail?
2369508 2370532 Different tail.
2379337 2380727 Cobb said you would be back.
2382121 2383703 I tried not to come, but...
2384024 2385570 But there is nothing quite like it.
2385825 2386790 It's just...
2388994 2390077 pure creation.
2390649 2393319 Shall we take a look<br />at some paradoxical architecture?
2393561 2395170 You are gonna have to master a few tricks,
2395195 2397209 if you are gonna build three<br />complete dream levels.
2397504 2398334 Excuse me.
2399139 2400233 What kind of tricks?
2400889 2404285 In a dream, you can cheat architecture<br />into impossible shapes.
2404310 2406267 That lets you create closed loops.
2406697 2408318 Like the Penrose Steps.
2409081 2410690 The infinite staircase.
2413918 2414588 See.
2419391 2420449 Paradox.
2420863 2422418 So a closed loop like that,
2422443 2425324 will help you disguise the boundaries<br />of the dream you create.
2425464 2427432 But how big do these levels have to be?
2427600 2430823 It could be anything from the floor<br />of a building to an entire city.
2431046 2432901 They have to be complicated enough,
2433042 2434482 that we can hide from the projections.
2434507 2435906 A maze?<br />Right, a maze.
2436248 2437498 And the better the maze...
2437610 2440272 Then the longer we have<br />before the projections catch us?
2440446 2441443 Exactly.
2442381 2444055 My subconscious seems polite enough.
2444513 2446010 You wait, they will turn ugly.
2446185 2448323 No one likes to feel someone else<br />messing around in their mind.
2449255 2450972 Cobb can't build anymore, can he?
2453192 2455081 I don't know if he can't, but he won't.
2455725 2457701 He thinks it's safer<br />if he doesn't know the layouts.
2457763 2458615 Why?
2458874 2459820 He won't tell me.
2460273 2461533 But I think it's Mal.
2461809 2462865 His ex-wife?
2463186 2464145 No, not his ex.
2464521 2465618 They are still together?
2465821 2466763 No.
2468636 2469677 She is dead.
2472044 2474262 What you see in there<br />is just his projection of her.
2478317 2479856 What was she like in real life?
2480592 2481717 She was lovely.
2485784 2487098 You are seeking a chemist?
2487334 2488052 Yes.
2488482 2490354 To formulate compounds for a job?
2491245 2492895 And to go into the field with us.
2493174 2495261 No. I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.
2495467 2499198 Well, we would need you there to tailor<br />compounds specific to our needs.
2499550 2500403 Which are?
2500552 2501589 Great depth.
2501889 2503114 A dream within a dream?
2503817 2504925 Two levels?
2507680 2508542 Three.
2509162 2510068 Not possible.
2510381 2512593 That many dreams within<br />dreams is too unstable.
2512618 2513451 It is...
2513703 2514664 possible.
2515310 2516693 You just have to add a sedative.
2516755 2518254 A powerful...
2518457 2519596 sedative.
2521227 2522508 How many team members?
2522679 2523604 Five.
2523629 2524653 Six.
2526232 2528222 The only way to know<br />you have done the job...
2529146 2530396 is if I go in with you.
2530577 2533497 There is no room for tourists<br />on a job like this, Mr. Saito.
2533869 2535991 This time, it seems there is.
2537157 2539066 This. I think, is a good place to start.
2539687 2540888 I use it every day.
2541155 2542111 What for?
2542486 2543633 Here. I will show you.
2547455 2549067 Perhaps you will not want to see.
2552163 2553114 After you.
2562935 2563632 Ten.
2564315 2566065 Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.
2566207 2567970 They come every day to share the dream.
2570910 2571515 You see?
2572257 2573437 Very stable.
2579253 2580608 How long do they dream for?
2580888 2581817 Three, four hours,
2582024 2582927 each day.
2583522 2584546 In dream time?
2584723 2585849 With this compound?
2586747 2587781 About 40 hours.
2587805 2588644 Each and every day.
2588669 2590043 Why do they do it?
2590068 2591434 Tell him, Mr. Cobb.
2593684 2595934 After a while, it becomes<br />the only way you can dream.
2596297 2597985 Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?
2598718 2600252 They come here every day to sleep?
2600620 2601461 No.
2603709 2605816 They come to be woken up.
2607413 2609894 The dream, has become their reality.
2611650 2614016 Who are you to say otherwise, sir?
2616322 2617602 Let's see what you can do.
2629378 2630970 You know how to find me.
2633333 2635038 You know what you have to do.
2640590 2641648 Sharp, no?
2657029 2658227 Are you alright,
2658251 2659318 Mr. Cobb?
2660633 2662064 Yeah, yeah.
2662377 2663630 Everything is just fine.
2672760 2673826 Robert Fischer,
2674155 2676457 heir to the Fischer Morrow<br />energy conglomerate.
2676812 2678468 What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?
2678502 2680094 That's not your concern.
2680937 2682001 Mr. Saito this...
2682210 2684921 this isn't your typical corporate espionage.
2685343 2686912 You-you asked me for inception.
2686937 2688507 I do hope you understand,
2688531 2690226 the gravity of that request.
2690554 2691260 Now,
2691515 2694669 the seed that we plant<br />in this man's mind will grow into an idea.
2694694 2696398 This idea will define him.
2696849 2698271 It may come to change...
2698570 2700868 Well, it may come to change<br />everything about him.
2701498 2705029 We are the last company standing<br />between them and total energy dominance.
2705696 2707224 And we can no longer compete.
2708131 2711085 Soon, they will control the energy supply<br />of half the world.
2711268 2712239 In effect,
2712403 2713952 they become a new superpower.
2715390 2718520 The world needs Robert Fischer<br />to change his mind.
2719179 2720248 That's where we come in.
2720426 2723691 How is Robert Fischer's relationship<br />with his father?
2723783 2724793 Rumor is...
2724824 2726801 the relationship is quite complicated.
2726894 2729379 Well, we can't work based<br />solely on rumor, can we?
2729536 2731528 Can you get me access to this man here?
2731758 2732685 Browning.
2733138 2734989 Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
2735214 2736919 Fischer Junior's godfather.
2737142 2738442 It should be possible.
2738764 2740404 If you can get the right references.
2740579 2744404 References are something<br />of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.
2745860 2748076 I am not smelling settlement here.
2748246 2749775 Take them down.<br />Mr. Browning!
2750015 2753517 Maurice Fischer's policy<br />is always one of avoiding litigation.
2756462 2757201 Well,
2757775 2760873 shall we voice your concerns<br />with Maurice directly?
2761170 2762569 Not sure that's necessary.
2762668 2764636 No, no, no. I-I think we should.
2786929 2787769 How is he?
2789394 2791543 I don't want to bother him<br />unnecessarily, but...
2792655 2793749 Robert, I told you...
2794140 2795515 keep out the damn.
2795929 2796757 Wait.
2796782 2797991 So do it. Get...
2798113 2800483 Mr. Fischer.<br />Put it through.
2801415 2802621 Never, never.
2802645 2805010 Never do the same as I asked.
2806187 2807279 Leave that.
2811450 2812388 Here.
2815532 2817662 Must be a cherished memory of his.
2818698 2820180 I put it beside his bed.
2821342 2822904 He has not even noticed.
2823700 2824443 Robert...
2827612 2829831 we need to talk about a power of attorney.
2829902 2831253 I know this is hard, but...<br />Not now.
2831278 2833103 But it's imperative we start...<br />Uncle Peter.
2837630 2839091 The vultures are circling.
2839427 2843130 And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,<br />the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.
2843749 2846240 I have had ample opportunity<br />to observe Browning...
2847175 2848667 and adopt his physical presence,
2848691 2850995 study his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.
2851456 2854753 So now in the first layer of the dream.<br />I can impersonate Browning.
2855745 2858340 And suggest concepts<br />to Fischer's conscious mind.
2858677 2859211 Then,
2859375 2861394 when we take him<br />a level deeper his own...
2861539 2864347 projection of Browning should<br />feed that right back to him.
2864785 2866370 So he gives himself the idea.
2866538 2867449 Precisely.
2868300 2870794 That's the only way it will stick.<br />It has to seem self-generated.
2870943 2871839 Eames.
2872196 2873605 I am impressed.
2874513 2875736 Your condescension,
2875760 2878074 as always, is much appreciated.<br />Arthur thank you.
2899383 2901374 Were you going under on your own?
2901607 2902930 No, no. I was just...
2903241 2904911 running some experiments.
2905633 2907345 I didn't realize anyone was here.
2907640 2910074 Yeah. I was just...<br />I was working on my totem, actually.
2910249 2911709 Here, let me take a look.
2913866 2914982 So you are learning?
2915178 2918055 An elegant solution<br />for keeping track of reality.
2919453 2920447 Was it your idea?
2920471 2921591 No, it was...
2922084 2923695 It was Mal's actually. This...
2924711 2925994 This one was hers.
2926018 2928064 She would spin it in the dream<br />and it would never topple.
2928574 2929414 Just...
2930063 2931385 spin and spin.
2933152 2934853 Arthur told me she passed away.
2937117 2938571 How are the mazes coming along?
2939077 2943614 Each level relates to the part of the subject's<br />subconscious that we are trying to access.
2943639 2944263 So,
2944521 2946848 I am making the bottom level a hospital.
2946872 2948678 So Fischer will bring his father...
2950139 2952646 You know, I... I actually.<br />I have a question about this layout.
2952671 2953528 No, no, no. Don't...
2953553 2955065 Don't show me specifics.
2955089 2956889 Only the dreamer should know the layout.
2957819 2958911 Why is that so important?
2959124 2961131 In case one of us brings in our projections.
2961212 2963436 We don't want them knowing<br />the details of the maze.
2964813 2966912 You mean in case you bring Mal in.
2967423 2969225 You can't keep her out, can you?
2970609 2971483 Right.
2971715 2974277 You can't build because<br />if you know the maze.
2974788 2975925 Then she knows it.
2975982 2977886 Well, she would sabotage the whole operation.
2978496 2980299 Cobb, do the others know?<br />No.
2980323 2981148 No, they don't.
2981219 2983449 You have got to warn them<br />if this is getting worse.
2983474 2984946 No one said it's getting worse.
2986658 2988015 I need to get home.
2988039 2989641 That's all I care about right now.
2990969 2992399 Why can't you go home?
2996164 2997790 Because they think I killed her.
3001473 3002446 Thank you.
3003176 3004040 For what?
3004380 3005747 For not asking whether I did.
3006551 3008855 I will split up my father's empire.
3008880 3012711 Now, this is obviously an idea that<br />Robert himself would choose to reject...
3012984 3015962 which is why we need to plant it deep<br />in his subconscious.
3016081 3017362 The subconscious...
3017407 3019109 is motivated by emotion, right?
3019290 3021907 Not reason. We need to find<br />a way to translate this,
3021977 3023571 into an emotional concept.
3023633 3025929 How do you translate business strategy<br />into emotion?
3026098 3027743 That's what we are here<br />to figure out right?
3027873 3031737 Robert's relationship with his father<br />is stressed, to say the least.
3031838 3033022 Can we run with that?
3033071 3036622 We suggest breaking up his father's<br />company as a screw you to the old man.
3036708 3038565 No, because I think positive emotion...
3038817 3040583 trumps negative emotion every time.
3040622 3042569 We all yearn for reconciliation.
3042840 3043801 For catharsis.
3044543 3048048 We need Robert Fischer to have<br />a positive emotional reaction to all this.
3048220 3049368 Alright, well try this.
3050602 3054939 My father accepts that I want to create<br />for myself, not follow in his footsteps.
3055512 3056493 That might work.
3056595 3057360 Might?
3058511 3060231 We need to do a little better than might.
3060423 3062059 Thank you for your contribution Arthur.
3062084 3064693 Forgive me for wanting<br />a little specificity Eames.
3065354 3066446 Specificity?
3066558 3068674 Inception's not about being specific.
3068721 3071931 When we get inside his mind, we are<br />gonna have to work with what we find.
3073666 3074935 On the top level,
3074959 3076860 we open up his relationship<br />with his father...
3077149 3077979 and say,
3078003 3080304 I will not follow in my father's footsteps.
3080392 3082401 Then the next level down, we feed him,
3082727 3085259 I will create something for myself.
3085284 3085935 Then,
3086138 3088407 by the time we hit the bottom level,<br />we bring out the big guns.
3088493 3090893 My father doesn't want me to be him.<br />Exactly.
3092170 3093245 Three layers down,
3093269 3094830 the dreams are gonna collapse,
3094854 3096410 with the slightest disturbance.
3096435 3097491 Sedation.
3098116 3099000 For sleep,
3099024 3101171 stable enough to create<br />three layers of dreaming
3101172 3104061 we will have to combine it with<br />an extremely powerful sedative.
3116332 3117387 Good night.
3118215 3119938 The compound we will be<br />using to share the dream
3119962 3122454 creates a very clear connection<br />between dreamers whilst,
3122888 3124594 actually accelerating brain function.
3124738 3126847 In other words, more time on each level.
3126930 3129722 Brain function in the dream will be<br />about 20 times normal.
3130191 3131950 And when you enter a dream within<br />that dream,
3132634 3133647 the effect is compounded.
3133823 3135338 It's three dreams.<br />That's 10 hours times 20...
3135941 3138651 Math was never my strong subject.<br />How much time is that?
3139221 3141182 It's a week, the first level down.
3142043 3143879 Six months the second level down.
3144697 3145778 And the third level...
3145803 3146778 That's 10 years.
3149696 3151857 Who would want be stuck<br />in a dream for 10 years?
3152319 3153479 Depends on the dream.
3153672 3156070 So once we have made the plant.<br />How do we get out?
3156539 3159306 I am hoping you have something more<br />elegant than shooting me in the head.
3159515 3160353 A kick.
3160773 3162109 What's a kick?
3162267 3163027 This.
3163051 3164507 Ariadne, would be a kick.
3167608 3169865 It's that feeling of falling you get<br />that jolts you awake.
3170100 3171576 Snaps you out of the dream.
3171654 3173567 How we gonna feel a kick<br />with this sedation?
3173592 3174748 That's the clever part.
3174773 3177904 I customized the sedative to leave<br />inner-ear function unimpaired.
3178149 3178997 That way,
3179207 3180530 however deep the sleep.
3181059 3182559 The sleeper still feels falling.
3183310 3184629 Or tipping.
3186313 3188381 The trick is to synchronize a kick,
3188514 3190172 that can penetrate all three levels.
3191174 3194094 We could use a musical countdown<br />to synchronize the different kicks.
3202598 3204648 He has not got any surgery scheduled,
3204672 3206140 no dental, nothing.
3206500 3208100 Was not he supposed to have<br />a knee operation?
3208125 3209031 Nothing.
3209146 3211304 Nothing that they will put him<br />under for, anyway we need...
3211576 3213510 We need at least a good 10 hours.
3213618 3214949 Sydney to Los Angeles.
3216288 3218161 One of the longest flights in the world.
3218291 3220119 He makes it every two weeks.
3220725 3222643 He must be flying private, then.
3223543 3226457 Not if there were unexpected<br />maintenance with his plane.
3226731 3229066 It would have to be a 747.<br />Why's that?
3229134 3230892 On a 747, the pilot's up top,
3230917 3232676 the first-class cabin's in the nose.
3232785 3234192 So no one would walk through.
3234256 3236012 Wait you would have<br />to buy out the entire cabin
3236036 3237748 and the first-class flight attendant.
3237809 3239154 I bought the airline.
3240946 3242544 It seemed neater.
3244653 3246478 Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.
3248037 3249119 Ariadne?
3249669 3251251 Terrific work, by the way.
3299110 3300762 You know how to find me.
3302809 3304242 You know what you have to do.
3308033 3310869 You remember when you asked me<br />to marry you?
3312217 3313681 Of course I do.
3315353 3317344 You said you had a dream.
3321338 3323022 That we would grow old together.
3324996 3326291 And we can.
3333465 3334932 You should not be here.
3339694 3342678 Just wanted to see what kind of tests<br />you are doing on your own every night.
3342803 3344483 This has nothing to do with you.
3344577 3346035 This has everything to do with me.
3346121 3347879 You have asked me<br />to share dreams with you.
3347904 3349061 Not these.
3350062 3351391 These are my dreams.
3362911 3364504 Why do you do this to yourself?
3365851 3367546 It's the only way I can still dream.
3370041 3371859 Why is it so important to dream?
3373300 3375067 In my dreams, we are still together.
3389761 3391126 These are not just dreams.
3393438 3394629 These are memories.
3394653 3396234 And you said never to use memories.
3396501 3397664 I know I did.
3398405 3399937 You are trying to keep her alive.
3400736 3401984 You can't let her go.
3402907 3404281 You don't understand.
3404795 3406229 These are moments I regret.
3406254 3408407 They are memories that I have to change.
3410131 3411876 Well, what's down there that you regret?
3412751 3415879 Listen, there is only one thing<br />you need to understand about me.
3424362 3425629 This is your house?
3426774 3428207 Mine and Mal's, yes.
3429400 3430395 Where is she?
3431729 3433090 She is already gone.
3438726 3440176 That's my son, James.
3440468 3442559 He is digging for something.<br />Maybe a worm.
3444540 3445766 That's Phillipa.
3446217 3448082 See I thought about calling out,
3448253 3450627 so they would turn and smile<br />and I could see this...
3451933 3453908 those beautiful faces of theirs but...
3455474 3456578 it's all too late.
3457228 3459328 Right now, or never Cobb.
3464475 3465859 Then I start to panic.
3466491 3469187 I realize I am gonna regret<br />this moment that...
3470046 3472280 I need to see their faces one last time.<br />James!
3472343 3473333 Phillipa!
3473818 3474755 Come on in!
3475192 3476663 But the moment has past.
3479562 3482088 And whatever I do,<br />I can't change this moment.
3483762 3485923 As I am about to call out to them...
3486856 3487948 they run away.
3490827 3492268 I am ever gonna see their faces,
3492292 3494092 again I have got to get back home.
3494983 3496022 The real world.
3537942 3539409 What are you doing here?
3540245 3541337 My name is...
3541512 3542674 I know who you are.
3543109 3544330 What are you doing here?
3552991 3555425 I am just trying to understand.
3555593 3557118 How could you understand?
3559062 3561189 Do you know what it is to be a lover?
3563176 3564934 To be half of a whole?
3566437 3567317 No.
3569474 3571020 I will tell you a riddle.
3573170 3574826 You are waiting for a train.
3576507 3578889 A train that will take you far away.
3580919 3583399 You know where you hope<br />this train will take you...
3584969 3586844 but you don't know for sure.
3587554 3588914 But it doesn't matter.
3590272 3592160 How can it not matter to you
3592184 3593673 where that train will take you?
3593698 3595061 Because you will be together.
3596501 3598414 How could you bring her here Dom?
3598439 3599719 What is this place?
3600126 3603228 This is a hotel suite where we<br />used to spend our anniversary.
3603253 3604584 What happened here?
3606577 3607592 You promised!
3607616 3610177 You promised, we would be together!
3610202 3612147 Please. I need you to stay here<br />just for now!
3612206 3615539 You said we would be together!<br />You said we would grow old together!
3615564 3616967 I will come back for you.
3617485 3618545 I promise.
3636403 3637455 Do you think,
3637660 3640844 you can just build a prison<br />of memories to lock her in?
3642516 3644970 Do you really think that<br />that's gonna contain her?
3645833 3646837 It's time.
3647811 3650143 Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.
3650531 3651718 When is the funeral?
3651743 3653194 Thursday. In Los Angeles.
3653219 3655668 Robert should accompany<br />the body no later than Tuesday.
3655764 3657007 We should move.<br />Alright.
3658296 3659553 Cobb. I am coming with you.
3659927 3661446 I promised Miles. No.
3661499 3663106 The team needs someone,
3663130 3664889 who understands what<br />you are struggling with.
3667205 3669014 And it doesn't have to be me...
3669704 3671572 but then you have to show Arthur,
3671940 3673063 what I just saw.
3678779 3680474 Get us another seat on the plane.
3684560 3687586 If I get on this plane and<br />you don't honor our agreement,
3687899 3690927 when we land I go to jail<br />for the rest of my life.
3692224 3694029 Complete the job en route,
3694475 3696766 I make one phone call from the plane,
3697144 3699749 you have no trouble<br />getting through Immigration.
3714068 3716075 I am sorry.<br />Oh, yeah, absolutely.
3716100 3717021 Thank you.
3751717 3753404 Excuse me. I think this is yours?
3754021 3755067 You must have dropped it.
3755329 3756936 Would you care for a drink?
3756961 3758258 Oh. Water, please.
3758429 3760067 Oh... same, please.
3763918 3764826 Thank you.
3765183 3766918 You know I could not help but notice but...
3767038 3769087 you would not happen to be related to...
3769111 3770633 the Maurice Fischer, would you?
3770808 3772090 Yes, he...
3773244 3774895 He was my father.
3775891 3779372 Well, he was a very inspiring figure.<br />I am sorry for your loss.
3782836 3784270 Here you go.<br />Thank you.
3784522 3785291 Hey.
3786374 3787557 To your father.
3788493 3790023 May he rest in peace?
3859197 3861376 You could not have peed before you went under?<br />Sorry.
3861493 3863938 A bit too much free champagne<br />before take off, hey Yusuf?
3863963 3865032 Ha, ha, bloody ha.
3865057 3867548 We know he is going to be looking<br />for a taxi in this weather.
3880017 3881124 Asshole!
3881562 3883337 Hey man, why don't you try...<br />Walk away.
3899749 3901280 Just have him ca...<br />I got to go.
3901305 3902178 Alright. Taxi!
3902498 3903452 Thank you.
3906377 3907141 Alright.
3907165 3909032 Third and Market. Snappy.
3909814 3911157 What are you doing?
3911225 3913098 Oh sorry, I thought it was free.<br />It's not.
3913123 3914607 Maybe we could share.<br />Maybe not.
3914631 3916118 Can you pull over and get this...
3920009 3920951 Great.
3926218 3927182 Come on.
3938939 3940216 There is $500 in there.
3940240 3941447 The wallet is worth more than that.
3941507 3943366 So you might at least drop me at my stop.
3943454 3944710 I am afraid that it doesn't...
3944851 3945577 Book!
3953953 3955922 Cover him!<br />Down! Down! Down!
3956186 3957569 What the hell is going on?<br />What the fuck!
3961621 3963054 This was not in the design.
3964783 3965522 Cobb?
3966705 3967506 Cobb?
4018072 4018861 Get him!
4026063 4027025 Are you alright?
4027698 4029578 Yeah. I am ok. I am ok.
4030096 4032109 Fischer is ok, unless he gets carsick.
4032212 4033141 Saito?
4052256 4053992 Get Fischer in the back room now.
4054692 4055915 Get him in the back room.
4055939 4057168 Move.<br />What the hell happened?
4058027 4059662 Has he been shot? Is he dying?
4059663 4060637 I don't know.<br />Jesus Christ.
4061527 4062824 Where were you? What happened to you?
4062849 4064073 Blocked by a freight train.
4064140 4066278 Why did you put a train cross<br />in the middle of a downtown intersection?
4066303 4067691 I didn't.<br />Where did it come from?
4067716 4069977 Let me ask you a question,<br />why the hell were we ambushed?
4070332 4071847 Those were not normal projections.
4071872 4073189 They have been trained for God's sakes!<br />You are right.
4073277 4074394 How could he be trained?
4074419 4075352 Fischer has
4075376 4076551 had an extractor,
4076576 4078700 teach his subconscious to defend itself, so...
4079107 4081896 his subconscious is militarized,<br />it should have shown in the research.
4081921 4083255 I am sorry.<br />Why the hell didn't it?
4083614 4085661 Calm down.<br />Don't tell me to calm down!
4085799 4087363 This was your job, goddamn it!
4087387 4088908 This was your responsibility!
4088933 4091107 You were meant to check<br />Fischer's background thoroughly!
4091132 4093155 We are not prepared<br />for this type of parody!
4093180 4095005 We have dealt with sub-security before!
4095030 4096748 We will be more careful<br />and we are gonna be fine!
4096773 4098743 This was not a part of the plan!<br />He is dying.
4098814 4100070 God!<br />So we put him out of his misery.
4100095 4101252 Cobb!<br />Don't do that!
4101277 4102948 Don't do that.<br />Cobb, hey, hey.
4103168 4105066 He is in agony.<br />I am waking him up.
4105242 4105965 No.
4106371 4107408 It won't wake him up.
4107433 4109488 What do you mean, it won't wake him up?<br />We won't wake him up?
4109513 4111113 When we die in a dream, we wake up.
4111138 4112169 Not from this.
4112672 4114625 We are too heavily sedated<br />to wake up that way.
4115805 4117448 Right. So, what happens when we die?
4117521 4119430 We drop into limbo. Are you serious?
4119523 4120312 Limbo?
4120489 4122201 Unconstructed dream space.
4122226 4124085 Well, what the hell is down there?<br />Just...
4124132 4125873 raw, infinite subconscious.
4125898 4127192 Nothing is down there,
4127293 4128972 except for what might have been left behind
4128996 4131584 by anyone sharing the dream<br />who is been trapped there before.
4131984 4133075 Which in our case,
4133099 4134082 is just you.
4134171 4135957 How long could we be stuck there?
4135982 4138532 Don't even think about trying<br />to escape until the sedation...
4138557 4139526 How long?<br />Jesus.
4139551 4141347 Decades. It could be infinite, I don't know.
4141372 4142760 Ask him, he is the one who is been there.
4143013 4144207 Let's get him upstairs.
4145850 4146910 Great.
4148285 4149339 Thank you.
4150454 4153792 So, now we are trapped in Fischer's mind,<br />battling his own private army,
4153858 4154972 and if we get killed,
4155613 4158242 we will be lost in limbo<br />till our brains turn to scrambled egg?
4165416 4166984 Someone got first aid?
4170125 4171530 So you knew these risks,
4171906 4173699 and didn't tell us?<br />There were not meant to be risks
4173723 4175744 I didn't know we would be dealing<br />with a load of gunfire.
4175769 4176638 You had no right.
4176663 4178495 It's the only way<br />you can go three layers deep.
4178983 4179872 And you?
4180077 4181403 You knew about this<br />and went along with it?
4181428 4182267 I trusted him.
4182292 4184366 You trusted him? And what did<br />he promised you half his share?
4184425 4185044 No.
4185459 4186462 His whole share.
4186486 4187834 Besides he said he had done it before.
4187892 4189548 You done it before. What with Mal?
4189766 4191731 Because that worked so good?<br />That has nothing to do with it.
4191755 4193562 I did what I had to to get to my children.
4193731 4195672 So you led us into a war<br />zone with no way out?
4195705 4196790 There is a way out.
4196815 4198620 We continue on with the job,
4198737 4201593 and we do it as fast as possible<br />and we get out using the kick.
4201618 4202681 Just like before.
4202706 4205134 Forget it. We go any deeper.<br />We just raise the stakes.
4205142 4207152 I am sitting this one out on this level.
4207177 4209835 Fischer's security is surrounding<br />this place as we speak.
4209860 4212415 Ten hours of flight time<br />is a week at this level.
4212416 4214615 That means each and every one of us<br />will be killed.
4214639 4216367 That I can guarantee you.
4216554 4219788 We have no other choice but to continue on<br />and do it as fast as possible.
4221926 4224498 Downwards is the only way forwards.
4225930 4226866 Get ready.
4227231 4229426 You, come on. Let's go shake him up.
4234271 4237145 I am insured against kidnapping<br />for up to 10 million.
4237474 4238762 This should be very simple.
4238787 4240505 Shut up! It won't be.
4240578 4244153 In your father's office below the<br />bookshelves is his personal safe.
4244254 4245638 We need the combination.
4246450 4247849 I don't know any safe.
4248052 4250231 That doesn't mean<br />you don't know the combination.
4252454 4253801 Tell us what it is.
4254539 4256059 I don't know.
4261533 4263660 We have it on good authority you do know.
4263734 4264540 Yeah?
4264728 4266230 Whose authority?
4267571 4269253 Five hundred dollars this cost.
4269688 4270797 What's inside it?
4271342 4273422 Cash, cards, ID...
4273651 4274586 and this.
4280150 4281196 Useful?
4282338 4283362 Maybe.
4283887 4284852 You are on.
4284876 4285884 You have got an hour.
4286090 4287114 An hour?
4288425 4290590 I was supposed to have all night<br />to crack this.
4290720 4293442 And Saito was not supposed<br />to be shot in the chest.
4293732 4296176 You have got one hour.<br />Now get us something useful, please.
4299336 4300336 What's that?
4300939 4302171 Good authority.
4306010 4307187 Uncle Peter.
4308412 4310247 Just make, just make them stop.
4310848 4313180 The combination.<br />I don't know it.
4313350 4315257 Why does Browning say you do?
4315281 4316146 I don't know.
4316334 4318802 Just let me. Let me talk to him<br />and I will find out.
4321079 4322306 You have one hour.
4322916 4323951 Start talking.
4325619 4326580 You alright?
4328754 4329682 You ok?
4333837 4336610 Those bastards have had at me for two days.
4338175 4340643 They have someone with access<br />to your father's office.
4340668 4342533 They are trying to open his safe.<br />Yeah.
4342846 4345576 They thought I would know the combination.<br />But I don't know it.
4345749 4347373 Yeah well, neither do I, so...
4347943 4348870 What?
4349347 4351335 Maurice told me that when he passed.
4351535 4352950 You were the only one able to open it.
4352975 4355298 No, he never gave me any combination.
4355926 4357007 Maybe he did.
4357126 4359688 I mean, maybe you just didn't know<br />it was a combination.
4360307 4361438 Well, what then?
4361463 4364219 I don't know, some meaningful<br />combination of numbers...
4364244 4366016 based on your-your...
4366040 4367808 your experiences with Maurice.
4369940 4371522 We didn't have very many...
4371983 4374054 Meaningful experiences together.
4374735 4376202 Perhaps after your mother died.
4378811 4380280 After my mother died.
4380460 4381585 You know what he told me?
4383141 4383992 Robert.
4384599 4385536 There is really...
4385950 4386704 nothing...
4386915 4387810 to be said.
4388708 4390755 Well, he was bad with emotion.
4390780 4391834 I was 11.
4392576 4393529 Uncle Peter.
4394329 4395462 How is he doing?
4396083 4397622 He is in a lot of pain.
4397874 4400676 When we get down to the lower levels.<br />The pain will be less intense.
4401645 4402817 And if he dies?
4404047 4405214 Worst case scenario?
4405682 4408070 When he wakes up.<br />His mind is completely gone.
4408184 4409059 Cobb.
4410301 4412245 I will still honor the arrangement.
4412632 4414582 I appreciate that Saito but...
4415066 4418097 when you wake up, you won't even<br />remember that we had an arrangement.
4418809 4420834 Limbo is gonna become your reality.
4420903 4422948 You are gonna be lost down there so long<br />that...
4423612 4424938 you are gonna become an old man.
4425147 4426797 Filled with regret?
4428105 4429321 Waiting to die alone.
4429583 4430414 No.
4431345 4432446 I will come back.
4433812 4435960 And we will be young men together again.
4442392 4443450 Breathe.
4443854 4446663 These people are gonna kill us<br />if we don't give them the combination.
4446688 4448757 They just wanna ransom us.<br />I heard them.
4448922 4452824 They are gonna lock us in that van.<br />And then drive it into the river.
4453196 4454663 Alright. What is in the safe?
4455695 4456855 Something for you.
4457386 4461201 Maurice always said<br />it was his most precious gift to you.
4462180 4463022 A will.
4463629 4465467 Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.
4465598 4466826 That's an alternate.
4466851 4469217 This would supersede the other<br />if you want it to.
4469331 4472233 It splits up the component businesses<br />of Fischer Morrow.
4472258 4475444 It would be the end<br />of the entire empire as we know it.
4476199 4478073 Destroying my whole inheritance?
4480259 4482090 Why would he suggest such a thing?
4482114 4483422 I just don't know.
4486205 4487584 He loved you Robert.
4488999 4490050 In his own way.
4490614 4491870 In his own way.
4493716 4494831 At the end...
4496322 4498339 he called me in to his deathbed.
4499229 4500711 He could barely speak.
4502116 4503403 But he took the trouble...
4503927 4505656 to tell me one last thing.
4508848 4510175 He pulled me close.
4513161 4514756 And I could only make out...
4516200 4517256 one word.
4521339 4522402 Disappointed.
4528907 4530101 When were you in limbo?
4531842 4535274 You might have the rest of the team<br />convinced to carry on with this job.
4535299 4536395 But they don't know the truth.
4536419 4537665 Truth? What truth?
4537956 4539565 The truth that, at any minute,
4539737 4542233 you might bring a freight train<br />through the wall.
4542386 4543361 The truth that,
4543525 4546215 Mal is bursting through your subconscious.
4546357 4548942 And the truth that.<br />As we go deeper into Fischer...
4549192 4550801 we are also going deeper into you.
4551672 4552327 And...
4552890 4554776 I am not sure<br />we are gonna like what we find.
4558922 4560389 We were working together.
4560525 4563297 We were exploring the concept<br />of a dream,
4563586 4564583 within a dream.
4564608 4565870 I kept pushing things.
4565895 4567926 I wanted to go deeper and deeper.<br />I wanted to go...
4568401 4569237 further.
4570135 4574557 I just didn't understand the concept<br />that hours could turn into years down,
4575048 4577219 that we could get trapped so deep only...
4578728 4581368 when we wound up on the shore<br />of our own subconscious...
4582491 4584744 we lost sight of what was real.
4591334 4593682 We created.<br />We built the world for ourselves.
4595367 4596992 We did that for years.
4598464 4599843 We built our own world.
4601887 4603257 How long were you stuck there?
4604693 4606224 Something like 50 years.
4610277 4611107 Jesus.
4613857 4615188 How could you stand it?
4615358 4617599 It was not so bad at first.<br />Feeling like gods.
4618261 4621029 The problem was knowing<br />that none of it was real.
4621465 4622439 Eventually,
4623013 4625497 it just became impossible<br />for me to live like that.
4626036 4627224 And what about for her?
4630907 4634297 She had locked something away,<br />something deep inside her.
4636213 4637981 A truth that she had once known but...
4639356 4640783 chose to forget.
4644019 4645379 Limbo became her...
4645629 4646620 reality.
4648225 4649683 What happened when you woke up?
4650318 4653229 Well, to wake up from that after,<br />after years,
4653354 4654333 after decades...
4655298 4659067 to become old souls thrown<br />back into youth like that?
4660531 4662286 I knew something was wrong with her.
4662623 4663970 She just would not admit it.
4665561 4667556 Eventually, she told me the truth.
4668341 4670070 She was possessed...
4670443 4671474 by an idea.
4671988 4674866 This one very simple idea,
4675398 4677096 that changed everything.
4678718 4680798 That our world was not real.
4682255 4685910 That she needed to wake up<br />to come back to reality that...
4687130 4688715 in order to get back home...
4690562 4691997 we had to kill ourselves.
4698950 4700505 What about your children?
4701114 4702830 She thought they were projections,
4703103 4705682 that our real children were waiting<br />for us up there somewhere.
4705707 4707603 I am their mother!<br />Calm down.
4707655 4709323 I can tell the difference.
4709348 4711465 If this is my dream.<br />Why can't I control this?
4711490 4713185 Because you don't know you are dreaming!
4713657 4715957 She was certain<br />there was nothing I could do...
4716088 4719286 no matter how much I begged.<br />No matter how much I pleaded.
4722683 4725709 She wanted to do it.<br />But she could not do it alone.
4725734 4727591 She loved me too much so...
4728529 4730088 she came up with a plan...
4730502 4731771 on our anniversary.
4758602 4759788 Sweetheart, what are you doing?
4760226 4761226 Join me.
4761282 4761828 Just,
4762016 4763497 just step back inside.
4763763 4765781 Alright?<br />Just step back inside now, come on.
4765806 4766710 No.
4767695 4770075 I am going to jump and<br />you are coming with me.
4770403 4771434 No. I am not.
4772239 4773965 Now, you listen to me.
4775052 4776051 If you jump,
4776340 4778147 you are not gonna wake up, remember?
4778680 4779816 You are gonna die. I am just...
4780129 4782307 just step back inside.<br />Come on.
4782331 4784340 Step back inside<br />so we can talk about this.
4784461 4785695 We have talked enough.
4788350 4789130 Mal.
4789438 4791617 Come out onto the ledge<br />or I will jump right now.
4791835 4792614 Ok.
4797407 4798704 We are gonna talk about this.
4799786 4800718 Alright?
4801411 4803913 I am asking you to take a leap of faith.
4804807 4805890 No, honey.
4807387 4808375 No. I can't.
4808796 4810115 You know I can't do that.
4810620 4812544 Take a second, think about our children.
4813400 4814584 Think about James.
4816026 4817427 Think about Phillipa now.
4817827 4820268 If I go without you.<br />They will take them away anyway.
4820930 4822104 What does that mean?
4822201 4824381 I filed a letter with our attorney,
4824668 4827167 explaining how I am fearful<br />for my safety.
4830240 4831977 How you have threatened to kill me.
4835092 4837398 Why did you do this?<br />I love you Dom.
4837981 4839886 Why did you?<br />Why-why would you do this to me?
4839911 4842707 I have freed you from the guilt<br />of choosing to leave them.
4842952 4844327 We are going home,
4844520 4845978 to our real children.
4846003 4848322 Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me.<br />Alright?
4848600 4849934 Mal, look at me, please?
4849959 4851373 You are waiting for a train.
4851628 4853295 Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
4853748 4855473 A train that will take you far away.
4855498 4857090 James and Phillipa,
4857114 4858508 are waiting for you!<br />You know where you hope,
4858532 4859696 this train will take you,
4859721 4861502 They are waiting for us!<br />But you can't know for sure.
4861527 4862804 Mal, look at me!
4862828 4864062 But it doesn't matter.
4864087 4865599 Mal, goddamn it!
4865623 4867110 Because you will be together.<br />Mal, listen to me!
4867410 4868226 Sweetheart!
4868477 4869540 Look at me!
4869565 4871141 Mal, no!
4871414 4872847 Jesus Christ!
4876352 4879907 She had herself declared sane<br />by three different psychiatrists.
4880256 4881909 It made it impossible for me,
4881934 4884262 to try to explain the nature of her madness.
4884627 4885855 So I ran.
4887532 4889762 Right now, or never Cobb.
4896306 4898215 James! Phillipa!
4898730 4900589 Come on in! Come on!
4901211 4902269 Alright, let's go.
4902812 4906399 I left my children behind and I have been<br />trying to buy my way back ever since.
4907183 4908808 Your guilt, defines her.
4909235 4910790 It's what powers her.
4911221 4914520 But you are not responsible<br />for the idea that destroyed her.
4915618 4918178 And if we are gonna succeed in this,
4918495 4920108 you have to forgive yourself.
4921257 4922779 And you are gonna have to confront her.
4923832 4925231 But you don't have to do that alone.
4925540 4927804 No, you are not...<br />I am doing it for the others.
4928461 4930288 Because they have no idea,
4930312 4932535 the risk they have taken<br />coming down here with you.
4938599 4939705 We have to move.
4940416 4941449 Time is up.
4941705 4942384 Alright.
4942720 4944747 I don't know any combination.
4944921 4947322 Not consciously, anyway.<br />How about instinctively?
4948191 4952127 I got somebody in your father's office<br />right now ready to tap in the combination.
4952295 4955099 Give me the first six numbers<br />that come to your head right now.
4955365 4957216 I have no idea.<br />Right now!
4957767 4960145 I said, right now! Right now!
4960170 4964072 Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.
4967944 4969358 You will have to do better than that.
4969713 4971233 Alright. Bag them.
4972287 4973542 You are going for a ride.
4977711 4978988 We are worth more to you alive.
4980373 4981425 You hear me?
4987097 4988205 What did you get?
4989132 4991775 That boy's relationship with his father<br />is even worse than we imagined.
4991835 4992859 This helps us how?
4993036 4995278 The stronger the issues.<br />The more powerful the catharsis.
4997340 4999590 How are you going to reconcile<br />them if they are so estranged?
4999615 5001296 I am working on that, are not I?<br />Work faster.
5001934 5003488 The projections are closing in quick.
5004314 5007074 We got to break out of here<br />before we are totally boxed in.
5042986 5043759 Damn it.
5044054 5046314 You must not be afraid to dream<br />a little bigger, darling.
5063940 5066855 We need to shift his animosity<br />from his father to his godfather.
5066880 5068727 Destroy his one positive relationship?
5068752 5070885 No, we repair his relationship<br />with his father,
5070910 5073324 whilst exposing his godfather's<br />true nature.
5073783 5076189 We should charge Fischer a lot more<br />than Saito for this job.
5076827 5079486 What about his security is gonna<br />get worse as we go deeper.
5079511 5081379 No I think we run with Mr. Charles.
5081404 5082189 No.
5082422 5083992 Who is Mr. Charles? Bad idea.
5083993 5086356 The second we get into<br />that hotel and approach Fischer
5086357 5088044 his security is gonna be all over us.
5088057 5090086 We run with Mr. Charles<br />like on the Stein job.
5090125 5092298 You have done it before?<br />Yeah and it didn't work.
5092468 5095787 The subject realized he was dreaming<br />and his subconscious tore us to pieces.
5095812 5097584 Excellent but you learned a lot, right?
5097895 5100124 I need some kind of distraction.<br />No problem.
5100390 5102585 How about a lovely lady<br />that I have used before?
5102869 5104710 Listen to me.<br />You drive carefully, alright?
5104735 5106768 Everything down there is<br />gonna be unstable as hell.
5112112 5113246 Don't jump too soon.
5113356 5115612 We only got one shot at that kick.<br />We got to make it.
5115637 5117063 I will play the music to let you know<br />it's coming.
5117087 5118269 The rest is on you.
5119048 5120371 You ready?<br />Ready!
5122241 5123191 Sweet dreams.
5123533 5124845 Am I boring you?
5126603 5128111 I was telling you my story.
5128486 5130064 I guess it was not to your liking.
5132584 5133952 I have a lot on my mind.
5135854 5137446 There goes Mr. Charles.
5142019 5143585 Mr. Fischer,
5144023 5144777 right?
5145088 5147988 Pleasure to see you again.<br />Rod Green from marketing, I...
5149957 5151819 And you must be?<br />Leaving.
5155722 5157111 In case you get bored.
5162338 5163703 Must have blown you off.
5163779 5166658 That is, unless her phone number<br />really is only six digits.
5168598 5170111 Funny way to make friends.
5170135 5172641 Someone stealing your wallet like that.
5177153 5179176 Goddamn it. The wallet alone<br />is worth at least...
5179201 5180481 500 dollars right?
5180806 5183442 Listen don't worry about it.<br />My people are already on it as we speak.
5183960 5185606 Who or what is Mr. Charles?
5186057 5189268 It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer<br />against his own subconscious.
5189974 5191305 And why don't you approve?
5191343 5193334 Because it involves telling the mark<br />that he is dreaming,
5193441 5195568 which involves attracting<br />a lot of attention to us.
5196072 5197807 Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
5198941 5200655 So now you have noticed how much time Cobb
5200680 5202832 spends doing things he says never to do.
5205481 5207003 Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?
5207565 5209339 I am sorry, but...<br />Hold on! Wait!
5210945 5212242 You look a bit perkier.
5212467 5214308 Very amusing, Mr. Eames.
5221073 5222563 Turbulence on the plane?
5222899 5224594 No, it's much closer.
5224767 5226164 That's Yusuf's driving.
5234920 5235927 I am sorry.
5236122 5237359 Who did you say you were?
5237413 5238880 Rod Green from marketing.
5239682 5241574 But that's not true at all, is it?
5243386 5244811 My name is Mr. Charles.
5244835 5246331 You remember me, don't you?
5247056 5249124 I am the head of your security down here.
5250066 5252000 Get out on a different floor.<br />Keep moving.
5252395 5254727 Dump the wallet.<br />Security will be looking for that.
5254958 5255880 Ok.
5255904 5257814 We need to buy Cobb a little more time.
5262038 5262991 Security?
5265893 5267788 You work for the hotel?<br />No, no.
5268291 5271987 I specialize in a very specific type<br />of security.
5273382 5275043 Subconscious security.
5275178 5276415 You are talking about dreams?
5277487 5278720 Are you talking about...
5279337 5280330 extraction?
5281343 5282942 I am here to protect you.
5296239 5298072 Mr. Fischer I am here to protect you,
5298096 5300692 in the event that someone<br />tries to access your mind
5300950 5302184 through your dreams.
5302399 5304699 You are not safe here.
5305948 5307258 They are coming for you.
5325902 5327206 Strange weather, isn't it?
5332775 5333777 You feel that?
5335878 5336945 What's happening?
5337246 5340030 Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention<br />to the strangeness of the dream,
5340650 5342882 which is making his subconscious<br />look for the dreamer.
5343686 5344452 For me.
5344624 5345959 Quick, give me a kiss.
5351761 5353006 They are still looking at us.
5353720 5354875 Yeah, it was worth a shot.
5356299 5357515 We should probably get out of here.
5373616 5374567 You feel that?
5375066 5377352 You have actually been trained<br />for this, Mr. Fischer.
5377461 5381191 Pay attention to the strangeness<br />of the weather, the shift in gravity.
5381524 5382949 None of this is real.
5383683 5384878 You are in a dream.
5389498 5391620 Now, the easiest way for you<br />to test yourself
5391644 5394480 is to try and remember how<br />you arrived at this hotel.
5394504 5395628 Can you do that?
5396839 5397917 Yeah, I...
5398307 5400534 No, breathe, breathe.<br />Remember your training.
5401010 5402760 Accept the fact that you are in a dream.
5402784 5404384 And I am here to protect you.
5404709 5405697 Go on.
5412355 5413688 You are not real?<br />No.
5414141 5415015 No.
5415657 5417671 I am a projection of your subconscious.
5418039 5422410 I was sent here to protect you in the event<br />that extractors tried to pull you into a dream.
5423232 5426192 And I believe that's what's<br />going on right now, Mr. Fischer.
5427570 5428324 Yeah.
5428692 5429387 Ok.
5430773 5431401 Ok.
5434844 5436134 Can you get me out of here?
5437647 5438572 Right away.
5438969 5440064 Follow me.
5454563 5455894 Hold on a second.
5460836 5462254 Jesus Christ! What are you doing?
5462838 5464674 These men were sent here<br />to abduct you, alright?
5465023 5466032 If you want my help.
5466118 5467518 You have to remain calm.
5469578 5471557 I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.
5483592 5484739 If this is a dream.
5485268 5487169 I should just kill myself<br />to wake up, right?
5487463 5489466 I would not do that if I were you.<br />Mr. Fischer.
5489538 5492419 I believe they have you sedated.<br />And if you pull that trigger...
5493302 5494462 you may not wake up.
5495604 5497619 You may go into a further<br />dream state, now...
5498386 5500072 you know what I am talking about.
5502244 5503502 You remember the training.
5505047 5506274 Remember what I said to you.
5507316 5508227 Give me the gun.
5520218 5522591 This room should be directly below 528?<br />Yeah.
5532274 5533764 Think, Mr. Fischer, think.
5533841 5535142 What do you remember,
5535298 5537107 from before this dream?
5537982 5538980 There was...
5539004 5541190 there was a lot of gunfire.<br />There was...
5541881 5542834 rain.
5544086 5545217 Uncle Peter.
5546037 5547556 Oh, my God, we have been kidnapped.
5547734 5549061 Where were they holding you?
5552628 5554124 They had us in the back of a van.
5554149 5555829 That explains the gravity shifts.
5556098 5558157 You are in the back of a van right now,<br />keep going.
5558334 5559971 It had something to do with...
5561237 5563206 Something to do with a safe.
5564740 5566456 God, why is it so hard to remember?
5566481 5569047 It's like trying to remember a dream<br />after you have woken up.
5569072 5571070 Listen, it takes years of practice.
5571656 5574108 You and Browning,<br />have been pulled into this dream
5574133 5576495 because they are trying to steal<br />something from your mind.
5576519 5579680 I need you to focus and try<br />and remember what that is.
5580556 5582099 What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!
5582239 5583491 A combination.
5583816 5586513 They demanded the first<br />numbers to pop into my head.
5586562 5589092 They are trying to extract a number<br />from your subconscious.
5589135 5590573 It can represent anything.
5590597 5592205 We are in a hotel right now.
5593657 5595080 We should try hotel rooms.
5595594 5597096 What was the number, Mr. Fischer?
5597121 5599654 Try and remember for me,<br />this is very important.
5600042 5600812 Five.
5602281 5603169 Five, two.
5603460 5604945 It was something.<br />It was a long number.
5604970 5607063 That's good enough we can start there.<br />Fifth floor.
5607088 5607773 Yep.
5608299 5609526 So do you use a timer?
5609969 5611982 No. I have to judge it for myself.
5612569 5614705 Or while you are all asleep in 528.
5614729 5616004 I wait for Yusuf's kick.
5616091 5618218 Well, how will you know?<br />His music warns me.
5618243 5620504 And then when the van hits<br />the barrier of the bridge,
5620624 5622081 that should be unmistakable.
5622136 5623689 So we get a nice,
5623713 5625444 synchronized kick.
5625868 5628011 If it's too soon.<br />We won't get pulled out.
5628437 5629659 But if it's too late.
5630233 5631539 I won't be able to drop us.
5631623 5632646 Well, why not?
5632671 5634847 Because the van will be in free fall.
5636157 5637882 Can't drop you without gravity.
5638162 5639169 Right.
5644244 5645919 They are with me.<br />Go on.
5671247 5672271 Mr. Charles.
5672448 5674031 Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
5674055 5675417 Yeah. I think so. Yeah.
5675443 5677297 They were trying to put you under.
5677946 5679914 I am already under.<br />Under again.
5680212 5682453 What do you mean.<br />A dream within a dream?
5683397 5684083 Hey.
5684413 5685865 I see you have changed.
5686057 5687202 I am sorry?
5688140 5689338 Oh. I am sorry.
5689362 5691179 I mistook you for a friend.
5693603 5695309 Good-looking fellow. I am sure.
5696382 5697440 No, no, no.
5697997 5699715 That's Fischer's projection of Browning.
5699751 5701497 Let's follow him and see how he behaves.
5701677 5702348 Why?
5702500 5704145 Because how he acts will tell us,
5704169 5706914 if Fischer is starting to suspect<br />his motives the way we want him to.
5712789 5713602 Uncle Peter.
5713970 5715414 You said you were kidnapped together?
5715440 5717184 Well, well, not exactly.
5717208 5719169 They al-They already had him.<br />They were torturing him.
5719194 5720661 And you saw them torture him?
5728203 5729768 The kidnappers are working for you?
5731006 5732034 Robert.
5732641 5734385 You are trying to get that safe open?
5735057 5736565 To get the alternate will?
5736894 5739355 Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.
5739539 5741078 I can't let you destroy it.
5741103 5743469 I am not gonna throw away<br />my inheritance, what would I?
5743623 5747787 I could not let you rise<br />to your father's last taunt.
5748791 5750524 What taunt?<br />The will Robert.
5750676 5751747 That will?
5751814 5753513 That's his last insult.
5753900 5755237 A challenge for...
5755583 5757529 you to build something for yourself,
5757900 5761286 by telling you, you are not worthy<br />of his accomplishments.
5767376 5769168 What, but that he was...
5769192 5770404 disappointed?
5771296 5772366 I am sorry.
5773967 5774673 But...
5775727 5776759 he is wrong.
5777953 5780345 You can build a better company<br />than he ever did.
5780465 5781548 Mr. Fischer?
5782298 5783314 He is lying.
5783439 5785430 How do you know?<br />Trust me, it's what I do.
5785502 5788156 He is hiding something.<br />And we need to find out what that is.
5789692 5793093 I need you to do the same thing to him<br />that he was going to do to you.
5795696 5798685 We will enter his subconscious and find out<br />what he doesn't want you to know.
5800909 5801700 Alright.
5808350 5809612 He is out.<br />Wait.
5809785 5811844 Whose subconscious are<br />we going into exactly?
5812245 5813455 We are going into Fischer's.
5813725 5816256 I told him it was Browning<br />so he would be a part of our team.
5816392 5818724 He is gonna help us break<br />into his own subconscious.
5818753 5819709 That's right.
5820629 5822248 Security is gonna run you down hard.
5822865 5825325 And I will lead them on a merry chase.
5825768 5827226 Just be back before the kick.
5827250 5828606 Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.
5833515 5834351 You good?
5837839 5839170 Hey. You ready?
5839301 5840509 Yes, yes. Some...
5841114 5842413 I am fine. I am ready.
5855552 5856345 Cobb?
5857633 5858340 Cobb?
5858903 5860033 What's down there?
5863439 5865436 Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn.
5866207 5867749 I mean, what's down there for you?
6024512 6025754 Did you see that?
6044953 6046784 Eames, this is your dream.
6046809 6049903 I need you to draw the security away<br />from the complex, you understand?
6050076 6051873 Who guides Fischer in?<br />Not me.
6052194 6054184 If I know the route.<br />Everything could be compromised.
6054830 6057271 I designed the place.<br />No, you are with me.
6057461 6058498 I could do it.
6059501 6061990 Alright. You brief him on the route<br />into the complex.
6062017 6062795 Fischer,
6062819 6064505 you will be going with him.<br />Alright.
6064865 6065939 What about you?
6066475 6067633 You keep this live.
6067657 6069308 I will be listening in the whole time.
6069627 6070969 The windows on that upper floor,
6070993 6073478 are big enough for me to cover<br />you from that tower, you see?
6074079 6075188 You are not coming in?
6075250 6077154 In order to find out the truth<br />about your father,
6077178 6079586 you are gonna need to break<br />into Browning's mind on your own.
6081344 6082320 Come on Fischer!
6138213 6139375 Sound the alarm!
6139512 6140664 Sound the alarm!
6140813 6141961 Go, go, go!
6142050 6142935 Move!
6145120 6146178 Go!
6161403 6162342 Sod it.
6173513 6174669 I hope you are ready.
6184026 6185698 No, it's too soon.
6192300 6193494 Cobb, do you hear that?
6193816 6195682 <i>I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago.</i>
6195707 6197253 I thought it was the wind up here.
6197691 6198639 Yeah, I hear it.
6198972 6200019 It's music.
6200379 6201386 So, what do we do?
6202010 6203307 We move fast.
6208737 6210455 Yusuf is 10 seconds from the jump.
6212872 6214643 Which gives Arthur three minutes.
6216324 6217617 Hey!<br />That's him!
6218813 6220589 Which gives us what?<br />Sixty minutes.
6220690 6222327 Can they make that route in an hour?
6222352 6224120 They have to climb to the terrace.
6224145 6226527 Then they need a new route.<br />A more direct route.
6238513 6239977 It's designed as a labyrinth.
6240034 6242502 There must be access routes<br />that cut through the maze, right?
6242951 6243915 Eames?
6267642 6268853 Did Eames add any features?
6268878 6270096 I don't think I should tell you.
6270167 6271878 If Mal was after...<br />We don't have time for this.
6271902 6272963 Did he add anything?
6273448 6276024 He added an air-duct system<br />that can cut through the maze.
6276157 6277500 Good. Explain it to them.
6277525 6278843 <i>Saito?</i><br />Go ahead.
6312187 6313237 Paradox.
6383558 6384611 What was that?
6384936 6385887 The kick.
6386326 6387119 <i>Cobb!</i>
6387143 6388250 Cobb, did we miss it?
6388496 6389684 Yeah, we missed it.
6390238 6391075 Man.
6391480 6392441 Could not someone...
6392653 6393625 have dreamt up...
6393758 6395220 a goddamn beach?
6398206 6399401 <i>What the hell do we do now?</i>
6400542 6402373 We finish the job before the next kick.
6402448 6403385 What next kick?
6403409 6404737 When the van hits the water.
6427502 6428994 <i>If you would like to make a call,</i>
6429018 6430938 <i>please hang up and try again.</i>
6431004 6432835 <i>If you need help, hang up...</i>
6433174 6435377 How do I drop you without gravity?
6438831 6440255 Arthur has a couple minutes.
6440279 6441493 And we have about 20.
6465073 6466110 You ok?
6471212 6472496 Run! Turn around!
6472520 6473720 Move to base!
6478953 6479953 There is something wrong.
6479978 6481649 They are heading your way.<br />Like they know something.
6483858 6485796 Just buy us more time, alright?
6486089 6486842 Come on!
6487318 6488186 On my way.
6488408 6489537 Come on! Move!
6574149 6575079 Alright.
6587760 6590456 Ok. That's the antechamber<br />outside the strong room.
6590894 6592407 Does the strong room have windows?
6592503 6594346 It would not be very strong if it did.
6594371 6596377 Let's hope Fischer likes<br />what he finds in there.
6598373 6601033 Are those projections his subconscious?<br />Yes.
6602063 6603668 Are you destroying parts of his mind?
6603692 6605133 No. They are just projections.
6631477 6632477 We are here.
6632478 6635272 You are clear, but hurry there is<br />an entire army headed your way.
6661993 6662884 I am in.
6668776 6669626 There he is.
6712420 6713653 There is someone in there.
6713677 6715232 Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.
6716424 6718686 Come on. Come on, a little lower.
6724622 6725423 Cobb.
6726534 6727250 No she...
6727540 6728986 She is not real.
6729671 6730744 How do you know that?
6730798 6732243 She is just a projection.
6732615 6734498 Fischer. Fischer is real.
6738525 6739381 Hello.
6745419 6747876 Eames!<br />Eames, get to the antechamber now!
6791884 6792899 What happened?
6793055 6794338 Mal killed Fischer.
6797171 6798229 I could not shoot her.
6799874 6801616 There is no use in reviving him.
6801640 6803241 His mind is already trapped down there.
6803411 6804469 It's all over.
6806214 6807601 So that's it then, we failed?
6808365 6809165 We are done.
6809665 6810640 I am sorry.
6814459 6816716 Well, it's not me that doesn't get back<br />to my family, is it?
6817937 6819926 It's a shame, I really wanted to know<br />what was going to happen in there.
6820015 6821241 I swear we had this one.
6821929 6823233 Let's set the charges.
6825803 6827147 Wait, there is still another way!
6828369 6830203 We just have to follow Fischer down there.
6830336 6831516 Not enough time.
6831885 6834180 No, but there will be enough time<br />down there.
6835786 6837008 And we will find him.
6837218 6839529 Ok, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in.
6839779 6841449 Just use the defibrillator to revive him.
6841474 6844375 We can give him his own kick<br />down below.
6845423 6846849 Look, you get him in there.
6847135 6848569 As soon as the music ends.
6848593 6850096 You blow up the hospital...
6850121 6852244 and we all ride the kick<br />back up the layers.
6854231 6855519 Hope it's worth a shot,
6856519 6858643 if Saito can hold the guards<br />off while I set the charges.
6859207 6861104 Saito will never make it, will he?
6862471 6864369 Cobb, come on.<br />We have got to try this.
6864997 6865997 Go for it.
6866520 6868856 If you are not back before the kick.<br />I am gone with or without you.
6868881 6869767 She is right.
6869791 6871215 She is right.<br />Come on. Let's go.
6876613 6878488 Can I trust you to do<br />what needs to happen here?
6878513 6879824 I mean, Mal is gonna be down there.
6880343 6882622 I know where to find her.<br />She will have Fischer.
6882647 6884032 How do you know?<br />Because...
6884527 6886261 she wants me to come after him.
6886977 6888668 She wants me back down there with her.
6916023 6916843 Alright?
6924298 6925367 This is your world?
6925656 6926594 It was.
6927535 6928969 And this is where she will be.
6930395 6931226 Come on.
6978157 6978996 Saito.
6979431 6980355 Saito.
6981389 6982213 I need you...
6982464 6985183 I need you to take care of Fischer<br />while I go set some charges, ok?
6985338 6987931 No room for tourists on these jobs.
6991216 6992135 Don't be silly.
7025408 7027447 You built all this?<br />This is incredible.
7027802 7029158 We built for years.
7030872 7032471 Then we started in on the memories.
7039710 7040671 This way.
7082880 7084232 This was our neighborhood.
7085259 7086732 Places from our past.
7087456 7088850 That was our first apartment.
7089697 7091427 Then we moved to that building<br />right there.
7091958 7094370 After Mal became pregnant.<br />That became our home.
7094684 7097066 You reconstructed all of this from memory?
7097772 7099581 Like I told you, we had lots of time.
7100035 7101097 What is that?
7103133 7104541 That's the house Mal grew up.
7105099 7106212 Well, will she be in there?
7106603 7107400 No.
7107900 7108728 Come on.
7109250 7112298 We both wanted to live in a house.<br />But we loved this type of building.
7112619 7114893 In the real world.<br />We would have to choose but not here.
7156263 7157665 How are we gonna bring Fischer back?
7158699 7160805 We are gonna have to come up<br />with some kind of a kick.
7161161 7161915 What?
7163704 7164829 I am gonna improvise.
7164916 7166969 Listen, there is something<br />you should know about me.
7167740 7168868 About inception.
7182523 7184361 An idea is like a virus.
7184906 7185923 Resilient.
7187139 7188580 Highly contagious.
7188881 7191900 And the smallest seed<br />of an idea can grow.
7193567 7194884 It can grow to define...
7196475 7197541 or destroy you.
7200952 7203552 A smallest idea such as,
7204340 7206506 Your world is not real.
7207030 7208564 Simple little thought,
7208588 7210207 that changes everything.
7212114 7213778 So certain of your world...
7214817 7216074 of what's real.
7216597 7217863 Do you think he is?
7220381 7222620 Or do you think he is as lost as I was?
7224410 7225823 I know what's real, Mal.
7227825 7230091 No creeping doubts?
7230976 7233162 Not feeling persecuted Dom?
7233991 7238154 Chased around the globe by anonymous<br />corporations and police forces,
7238282 7240678 the way the projections<br />persecute the dreamer?
7242581 7243568 Admit it.
7245322 7247597 You don't believe in one reality anymore.
7248278 7249612 So choose.
7250191 7251808 Choose to be here.
7252710 7253901 Choose me.
7280321 7281583 You know what I have to do.
7281646 7284308 I have to get back to our children<br />because you left them.
7285532 7286956 Because you left us.
7287067 7288067 You are wrong.
7288292 7289292 I am not wrong.
7289317 7290797 You are confused.
7292347 7293867 Our children are here.
7294894 7297759 And you would like to see their faces again.<br />Would not you?
7298690 7301443 Yes, but I am gonna see them up above Mal.
7315446 7316627 Up above?
7318302 7319717 Listen to yourself.
7320084 7321897 These are our children.
7322434 7323326 Watch.
7324294 7325989 James? Phillipa?
7326367 7327808 Don't do this Mal. Please.
7328118 7330478 Those are not my children.<br />You keep telling yourself that.
7330502 7332146 But you don't believe it.<br />No. I know it.
7332170 7333405 What if you are wrong?
7333705 7335447 What if I am what's real?
7337254 7339244 You keep telling yourself what you know.
7340831 7342822 But what do you believe?
7344159 7345387 What do you feel?
7347513 7348307 Guilt.
7350197 7351759 I feel guilt, Mal.
7352975 7354668 And no matter what I do. No...
7355508 7357311 No matter how hopeless I am.
7357336 7359507 No matter how confused.<br />That guilt...
7360023 7361602 is always there,
7361633 7363648 reminding me of the truth.
7364389 7365686 What truth?
7368422 7369531 The idea,
7370208 7373125 that caused you to question<br />your reality came from me.
7377117 7379458 You planted the idea in my mind?
7381622 7383112 What is she talking about?
7384017 7386242 The reason I knew inception was possible,
7386266 7387159 was because I...
7387550 7389148 did it to her first.
7390441 7391851 I did it to my own wife.
7392226 7393125 Why?
7393926 7395508 We were lost in here.
7396416 7398431 I knew we needed to escape but...
7398853 7400635 she would not accept it.
7403999 7406387 She had locked something away,<br />something...
7407543 7409295 something deep inside.
7410837 7412768 A truth that she had once known but...
7412948 7414322 chose to forget.
7415755 7417500 And she could not break free.
7420507 7422781 So I decided to search for it.
7424131 7426657 I went deep into the recess of her mind,
7426681 7428552 and found that secret place.
7429169 7430545 And I broke in...
7431568 7433429 and I planted an idea.
7434322 7437650 A simple little idea<br />that would change everything.
7443550 7445343 That her world was not real.
7458732 7460988 That death was the only escape.
7469138 7470580 You are waiting for a train.
7473414 7475244 A train that will take you far away.
7477318 7479539 You know where you hope<br />this train will take you...
7481320 7482898 but you can't know for sure.
7484539 7485796 Yet it doesn't matter.
7487594 7488594 Now, tell me why!
7488820 7490387 Because you will be together!
7495062 7496341 But I never knew that,
7496911 7500880 that idea would grow in her mind like<br />a cancer that even after she woke.
7504496 7506964 That even after<br />you came back to reality...
7509909 7512595 that you would continue to believe<br />your world was not real.
7515578 7517619 That death was the only escape.
7518303 7520965 Mal, no! Jesus!
7521195 7523337 You infected my mind.
7523361 7524892 I was trying to save you.
7524917 7526316 You betrayed me.
7527301 7528759 But you can make amends.
7528876 7530832 You can still keep your promise.
7530944 7532513 We can still be together,
7532802 7533949 right here...
7534109 7536191 in the world we built together.
7617549 7618182 Cobb.
7618206 7619470 We need to get Fischer.
7620759 7622056 You can't have him.
7623197 7624915 If I stay here, will you let him go?
7625320 7626634 What are you talking about?
7630877 7632388 Fischer is on the porch.
7633507 7634823 Go check he is alive Ariadne.
7634848 7636004 Cobb, you can't do this.
7636029 7638301 Go check he is alive right now.<br />Do it.
7654561 7657196 He is here! And it's time.<br />But you have to come now!
7657831 7659306 You take Fischer with you, alright?
7659330 7661352 You can't stay here to be with her.
7663914 7664770 I am not.
7665195 7666610 Saito is dead by now.
7666635 7668315 That means he is down here somewhere.
7668495 7670085 That means I have to find him.
7672274 7673862 I can't stay with her anymore.
7673886 7675368 Because she doesn't exist.
7675473 7678468 I am the only thing<br />you do believe in anymore.
7679286 7680047 No.
7681507 7682514 I wish.
7684551 7686592 I wish more than anything but...
7688428 7691102 I can't imagine you with<br />all your complexity,
7691227 7693711 all your perfection, all your imperfection.
7694968 7696125 You alright?<br />Yeah.
7696207 7697305 Look at you.
7699239 7700514 You are just a shade.
7701020 7703527 You are just a shade of my real wife.
7704611 7706413 And you were the best that I could do but...
7707878 7710165 I am sorry, you are just not good enough.
7710496 7712238 Does this feel real?
7714509 7715629 What are you doing?
7716240 7717339 Improvising.
7725660 7726900 No, no, no!
7728485 7730285 In there, now. Go, go, go, go.
7775683 7776700 I was...
7776902 7777644 dis...
7779382 7780177 I was dis...
7780942 7781909 disap...
7782366 7783180 I know Dad.
7783492 7784605 Dis...
7791018 7792621 I know you were disappointed...
7793921 7795286 I could not be you.
7795743 7796527 No.
7797621 7798582 No, no, no, no.
7799913 7801454 I was disappointed...
7803594 7804892 that you tried.
7829006 7829887 What?
7839953 7840940 Come on, come on.
7871349 7872208 Dad?
7911298 7912684 That's the kick Ariadne!
7912878 7914292 You have to go now!
7927300 7928408 Don't lose yourself!
7928865 7930763 Find Saito and bring him back!
7930810 7931966 I will!
7972023 7974667 You remember when you asked me<br />to marry you?
7975649 7976741 Yes.
7976862 7979922 You said you dreamt<br />that we would grow old together.
7982650 7983633 But we did.
7986016 7987665 We did. You don't remember?
7993166 7994993 I miss you more than I can bear...
7998112 7999821 but we had our time together.
8001708 8002958 And I have to let you go.
8005879 8007286 I have to let you go.
8058932 8060076 I am sorry Robert.
8087894 8090720 You know, the will means that Dad<br />wanted me to be my own man...
8092420 8093962 not just to live for him.
8096222 8097842 That's what I am gonna do Uncle Peter.
8108324 8109222 What happened?
8110118 8111007 Cobb stayed.
8111109 8111891 With Mal?
8111972 8113234 No, to find Saito.
8115689 8116813 He will be lost.
8119859 8121173 No, he will be alright.
8137554 8139522 Have you come to kill me?
8143802 8145746 I am waiting for someone.
8150867 8153228 Someone from a half-remembered dream.
8156232 8157416 Cobb?
8159866 8160944 Impossible.
8161839 8163874 We were young men together.
8166123 8167843 I am an old man.
8169943 8171277 Filled with regret.
8174882 8176848 Waiting to die alone.
8181021 8182354 I have come back for you.
8186459 8187626 To remind you...
8188565 8189627 of something.
8193498 8195148 Something you once knew.
8198736 8200366 That this world is not real.
8205862 8209614 To convince me to honor<br />our arrangement?
8211317 8213518 To take a leap of faith, yes.
8220091 8220838 Come back...
8223946 8226429 so we can be young men together again.
8230984 8232152 Come back with me.
8236159 8237248 Come back.
8247227 8248547 Hot towel sir?
8249640 8252507 We will be landing in Los Angeles<br />in about 20 minutes.
8252669 8254289 Do you need immigration forms?
8257097 8258036 Thank you.
8258898 8260091 Hot towel sir?
8261409 8262075 No.
8262176 8263699 Do you need immigration forms?
8336042 8337404 Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.
8338244 8339201 Thank you, sir.
8383923 8384689 Welcome.
8385641 8386579 This way.
8408347 8409388 James?
8409740 8410941 Phillipa?
8415305 8416355 Look who is here.
8422428 8423266 Hey.

8432605 8433705 What are you building?
8433729 8436302 We are building a house on the cliff!
8436476 8438084 On the cliff? Come on.
8438108 8439550 I want you to show me.<br />Can you show me?
8439636 8442196 Let's go. Come on.<br />Daddy!
