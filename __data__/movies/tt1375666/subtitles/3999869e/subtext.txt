85464 86841 (SPEAKING IN JAPANESE)
93773 98778 He was delirious. But<br />asked for you by name.
100780 102380 Show him.
103681 106382 He was carrying<br />nothing but this...
107783 109384 and this.
130117 132859 Are you here to kill me?
140530 143033 I know what this is
144100 149278 I've seen one before.<br />Many, many years ago.
150875 155791 It belonged to a man I met<br />in a half-remembered dream.
157783 162893 A man possessed of<br />some radical notions.
166761 169640 COBB: What is the most<br />resilient parasite?
169898 173277 A bacteria? A virus?
173836 175111 An intestinal worm?
175438 176678 ARTHUR Uh...
176840 178478 What Mr. Cobb is trying to say.
178641 179847 An idea.
181145 183648 Resilient. Highly contagious.
183814 187820 Once an idea has taken hold of the brain<br />it's almost impossible to eradicate.
188253 192532 An idea that is fully formed,<br />fully understood, that sticks.
192692 193932 Right in there somewhere.
194093 195664 For someone like you to steal?
195829 198776 Yes. In the dream state, your<br />conscious defenses are lowered
198932 201379 and that makes your thoughts<br />vulnerable to theft.
201536 202776 It's called extraction.
202937 206511 Mr. Saito, we can train your<br />subconscious to defend itself
206675 209178 from even the most<br />skilled extractor.
209345 210518 How can you do that?
210680 213524 Because I am the most<br />skilled extractor
213984 217398 I know how to search your mind and<br />find your secrets. I know the tricks.
217555 220503 And I can teach them to you, so<br />that even when you're asleep
220659 223003 your defense is never down.
223896 227811 Look, if you want my help, you're gonna<br />have to be completely open with me.
227967 231347 I need to know my way around your<br />thoughts better than your wife
231505 233815 better than your therapist<br />better than anyone.
234241 236916 If this is a dream, and you<br />have a safe full of secrets
237078 239422 I need to know<br />what's in that safe.
239581 243052 In order for this all to work,<br />you need to completely let me in.
245923 250565 Enjoy your evening, gentlemen<br />as I consider your proposal.
253031 254066 He knows
254232 255836 (RUMBLING)
257102 258581 What's going on up there?

305994 307269 (RUMBLING)
312836 315442 Saito knows. He's<br />playing with us.
315839 318184 Doesn't matter. I can<br />get it here Trust me.
318342 319844 The information is in the safe.
320011 322185 He looked right at it<br />when I mentioned secrets.
323549 324584 What's she doing here?
327520 330399 Just head back to the room. All right?<br />I'll take care of this.
330557 332595 Okay, make sure you do<br />We're here to work.
341036 345713 If I jumped, would I survive?
348078 350490 With a clean dive, perhaps.
350647 352321 Mal, what are you doing here?
352483 354690 I thought you might<br />be missing me.
354986 356524 COBB: You know that I am.
357690 360170 But I can't trust you anymore.
360893 362271 So what?
363830 366037 MAL: Looks like Arthur's taste.
366199 369841 Actually, the subject is partial<br />to postwar British painters.
371539 373247 Please, have a seat.
380984 382430 MAL: Tell me
382820 384390 do the children miss me?
388727 390434 You can't imagine.
394600 395704 What are you doing?
395868 397404 Just getting some fresh air.
397804 399579 Stay where you are, Mal

476998 478569 SAITO: Turn around.
478735 479770 The gun, Dom.
489047 490185 Please.
502295 504674 Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.
505066 508479 Did she tell you?<br />Or have you known all along?
508904 513876 That you're here to steal from me<br />or that we are actually asleep?
518014 520393 I want to know the<br />name of your employer.
522386 526267 Ah, there's no use threatening<br />him in a dream, right, Mal?
526424 528904 That depends on what<br />you're threatening.
529796 531969 Killing him would<br />just wake him up.
532732 533904 But pain
535569 537014 (SCREAMS)
537838 539750 Pain is in the mind.
540441 544652 And judging by the decor, we're<br />in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?
548117 549187 (GRUNTS)
556060 559166 - What are you doing? It's too soon.<br />- But the dream's collapsing.
559330 562778 I'm gonna try to keep Saito under a<br />little hit longer. We're almost there
563168 564272 (SILENCED GUNFIRE)
576985 580957 He was close. Very close

637457 638800 (GRUNTS)
645668 647614 He won't wake.
652075 653396 - Give him the kick!<br />- NASH: What?
653910 654945 Dunk him

699498 700875 COBB: He's out
702869 704780 (SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
706173 708244 You came prepared, hmm?
708409 712256 Not even my head of security knows<br />this apartment. How did you find it?
712881 716625 It's difficult for a man of your position<br />to keep a love nest like this secret...
716786 719323 particularly where there's<br />a married woman involved.
719489 721470 - She would never.<br />- Yet here we are.
722526 724631 - With a dilemma.<br />- They're getting closer.
724795 727572 - You got what you came for<br />- COBB: Well, that's not true.
727732 730406 You left out a key piece<br />of information didn't you?
730568 733778 You held something back because<br />you knew what we were up to.
733939 736819 - Question is, why'd you let us in at all?<br />- An audition.
738011 740958 - An audition for what?<br />- Doesn't matter. You failed.
741114 743823 We extracted every hit of<br />information you had in there.
744218 746528 But your deception was obvious

787404 791853 - So leave me and go.<br />- You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.
792008 796253 That corporation that hired<br />us they won't accept failure.
796414 798554 We won't last two days
800486 801692 Cobb?
801854 804995 Looks like I'm gonna have to<br />do this a little more simply.
805158 808936 Tell us what you know!<br />Tell us what you know, now!
809830 811571 (LAUGHING)
812299 815179 SAITO: I've always<br />hated this carpet
815804 819719 it's stained and frayed<br />in such distinctive ways.
821210 824556 But very definitely made of wool.
825382 827089 Right now
828119 830565 I'm lying on polyester.
834426 839274 Which means I'm not lying on<br />my carpet, in my apartment.
840133 843411 You have lived up to your<br />reputation Mr. Cobb.
843838 845875 I'm still dreaming
847542 849284 (ALARM BEEPING)
852548 854392 How'd it go?<br />Not good.
859790 863898 Dream within a dream, huh?<br />I'm impressed.
865163 868668 But in my dream, you<br />play by my rules.
868834 871110 Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito.
871270 872681 We're not in your dream.
872838 874409 We're in mine

886622 888933 - It wasn't my fault.<br />- You're the architect
889092 891231 I didn't know he was gonna<br />rub his cheek on it!
891394 892498 That's enough.
893598 895134 You. What the hell was all that?
895633 898513 I have it under control. I'd<br />hate to see you out of control.
898670 902447 We don't have time for this<br />I'm getting off at Kyoto.
902608 904452 ARTHUR: He's not gonna<br />check every compartment.
904611 906249 Yeah, well, I don't like trains.

1002894 1007537 Well, I can't, sweetheart. I<br />can't Not for a while, remember?
1007700 1009043 JAMES why?
1009369 1014946 Look, I told you, I'm away<br />because I'm working, right?
1015243 1018087 PHILLIPA: Grandma says<br />you're never coming back.
1018747 1020659 COBB: Phillipa, is that you?
1021617 1023961 Put Grandma on the<br />phone for me will you?
1024120 1025828 PHILLIPA: She's shaking her head.
1027958 1030462 Well, just hope she's<br />wrong about that.
1031329 1032535 JAMES: Daddy?
1033231 1034266 Yeah, James?
1034432 1036106 JAMES: Is Mommy with you?
1038737 1040945 James, we talked about this.
1042242 1044586 Mommy's not here anymore.

1075549 1076721 Hey, are you okay?
1077451 1078759 Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
1078919 1081366 Well, down in the<br />dream Mal showing up.
1081522 1084765 Look, I'm, uh, sorry about<br />your leg Won't happen again.
1084926 1086321 It's getting worse, isn't it?
1086347 1088559 One apology's all you're<br />getting, all right?
1088697 1091178 - Where's Nash?<br />- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?
1091334 1093814 We were supposed to deliver<br />Saito's expansion plans...
1093970 1095745 To Cobol Engineering<br />two hours ago.
1095906 1099149 By now, they know we failed<br />it's time we disappear.
1099677 1102181 - Where you gonna go?<br />- Buenos Aires.
1102347 1106626 I can lie low there, maybe sniff out<br />a job when things quiet down. You?
1106786 1107992 Stateside.
1108187 1109689 Send my regards.
1116030 1119603 He sold you out. Thought to come<br />to me and bargain for his life.
1121770 1123579 So I offer you the satisfaction
1127511 1130048 it's not the way I<br />deal with things
1133117 1134619 (HELICOPTER STARTING)
1142328 1145207 - What will you do with him?<br />- Nothing.
1145598 1148102 But I can't speak for<br />Cobol Engineering.
1162619 1165623 - What do you want from us?<br />- Inception.
1167225 1169637 Is it possible?<br />Of course not.
1169794 1172002 If you can steal an idea<br />from someone's mind...
1172164 1174041 Why can't you plant<br />one there instead?
1174199 1176304 Okay, here's me planting<br />an idea in your head.
1176468 1179780 I say, "Don't think about elephants<br />What are you thinking about?"
1179940 1180975 Elephants.
1181141 1184316 Right. But it's not your idea,<br />because you know I gave it to you.
1184512 1187494 The subject's mind can always<br />trace the genesis of the idea.
1187649 1190858 True inspiration's impossible<br />to fake That's not true.
1193389 1196495 - Can you do it?<br />- Are you offering me a choice?
1196659 1199334 Because I can find my own way<br />to square things with Cobol.
1199496 1201533 Then you do have a choice.
1201699 1203475 Then I choose to leave, sir.
1208374 1210081 Tell the crew where<br />you want to go.
1215349 1216419 Hey, Mr. Cobb.
1219587 1221658 How would you like to go home?
1222458 1225769 To America. To your children.
1226195 1229541 You can't fix that. No one can.
1229699 1232943 - Just like inception.<br />- Cobb, come on.
1236674 1239588 How complex is the idea?<br />Simple enough.
1239745 1243284 No idea is simple when you need to<br />plant it in somebody else's mind.
1243683 1247187 My main competitor is an<br />old man in poor health.
1247353 1251131 His son will soon inherit<br />control of the corporation.
1252026 1255600 I need him to decide to break<br />up his father's empire.
1256297 1258972 Cobb, we should walk<br />away from this Hold on.
1261037 1264315 If I were to do this<br />if I even could do it
1264474 1266385 I'd need a guarantee.
1266543 1269821 - How do I know you can deliver?<br />- You don't.
1270415 1271894 But I can.
1272483 1277058 So do you want to<br />take a leap of faith
1277489 1281336 or become an old man<br />filled with regret...
1281494 1284101 Waiting to die alone?
1287168 1291481 Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And<br />choose your people more wisely.
1299583 1301426 Look, I know how much<br />you wanna go home.
1304222 1305963 This can't be done.
1306124 1309402 Yes, it can. Just have<br />to go deep enough.
1309595 1311131 You don't know that
1312465 1314309 I've done it before.
1315502 1316674 Who'd you do it to?
1321909 1323912 Why are we going to Paris?
1325514 1327221 We're gonna need a new architect
1327816 1329524 (BELLS TOLLING)
1344137 1346208 COBB: You never did like<br />your office, did you?
1348007 1351046 No space to think in<br />that broom cupboard.
1352913 1355155 Is it safe for you to be here?
1356384 1358796 Extradition between France<br />and the United States...
1358954 1361195 Is a bureaucratic<br />nightmare you know that.
1361357 1364100 I think they might find a way<br />to make it work in your case.
1364261 1368767 Look, I, uh, brought these for you to<br />give to the kids when you have a chance.
1368932 1371539 It'll take more than the<br />occasional stuffed animal
1371702 1374684 to convince those children<br />they still have a father.
1374840 1377684 I'm just doing what I know.<br />I'm doing what you taught me
1377843 1379380 I never taught you to be a thief.
1379546 1381753 No, you taught me to<br />navigate people's minds.
1381915 1383223 But after what happened
1383383 1386957 there weren't a whole lot of legitimate<br />ways for me to use that skill.
1392093 1393595 What are you doing here, Dom?
1395698 1398110 I think I found a way home
1398267 1401841 it's a job for some very,<br />very powerful people.
1402072 1406488 People who I believe can fix<br />my charges permanently.
1407278 1408552 But I need your help.
1409247 1412559 You're here to corrupt one<br />of my brightest and best.
1412718 1415632 You know what I'm offering. Let<br />them decide for themselves.
1415789 1417268 Money. Not just money.
1417424 1418767 You remember
1418925 1422169 it's the chance to build<br />cathedrals entire cities...
1422330 1424105 Things that never existed
1424265 1427475 things that couldn't<br />exist in the real world.
1427636 1432814 So you want me to let someone else<br />follow you into your fantasy?
1432976 1434957 They don't actually<br />come into the dream.
1435112 1438389 They just design the levels and teach<br />them to the dreamers. That's all.
1438549 1439789 Design it yourself.
1442454 1443956 Mal won't let me.
1450163 1452302 Come back to reality, Dom.
1453634 1456206 Please. Reality.
1456571 1459108 Those kids, your grandchildren
1459274 1463280 they're waiting for their father to<br />come back home. That's their reality.
1463445 1466655 And this job, this last job<br />that's how I get there.
1467183 1470825 I would not be standing here<br />if I knew any other way.
1473991 1476905 I need an architect<br />who's as good as I was
1481100 1483102 I've got somebody better.
1483269 1484304 Ariadne?
1486907 1489444 I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.
1489843 1490948 Pleased to meet you.
1491112 1495789 If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a<br />job offer he'd like to discuss with you.
1495952 1496987 A work placement?
1497386 1498694 Not exactly
1498854 1500197 I have a test for you.
1500924 1502995 You're not gonna tell<br />me anything first?
1503160 1505801 Before I describe the job, I<br />have to know you can do it
1505964 1509173 - why?<br />- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.
1512271 1516948 You have two minutes to design a maze<br />that it takes one minute to solve.
1518878 1520016 Stop.
1522450 1523656 Again.
1525786 1527130 Stop.
1530292 1532364 You're gonna have to<br />do better than that.
1545377 1546652 That's more like it.
1566836 1569749 COBB: They say we only use a fraction<br />of our brain's true potential.
1569906 1571614 Now, that's when we're awake.
1571776 1574757 When we're asleep, our mind<br />can do almost anything.
1574912 1575947 Such as?
1576113 1580119 Imagine you're designing a building<br />You consciously create each aspect.
1580285 1584132 But sometimes, it feels like it's almost<br />creating itself, if you know what I mean.
1584290 1586270 Yeah, like I'm discovering it.
1586426 1588703 Genuine inspiration, right?
1588862 1592208 Now, in a dream, our mind<br />continuously does this.
1592367 1597010 We create and perceive<br />our world simultaneously.
1597173 1600586 And our mind does this so well that<br />we don't even know it's happening.
1600743 1603486 That allows us to get right<br />in the middle of that process.
1603647 1606025 How?<br />By taking over the creating part.
1606183 1607822 Now, this is where I need you.
1607985 1610363 You create the<br />world of the dream.
1610521 1615904 We bring the subject into that dream, and<br />they fill it with their subconscious.
1616061 1620738 How could I ever acquire enough detail<br />to make them think that it's reality?
1620900 1624371 Well, dreams, they feel real<br />while we're in them, right?
1624538 1628248 It's only when we wake up that we<br />realize something was actually strange.
1629711 1631122 Let me ask you a question.
1631279 1634693 You never really remember the<br />beginning of a dream, do you?
1634851 1637890 You always wind up right in<br />the middle of what's going on
1638055 1639090 I guess, yeah.
1639256 1640826 So how did we end up here?
1641225 1643297 Well, we just came from the, uh.
1643495 1646942 Think about it, Ariadne.<br />How did you get here?
1647533 1649444 Where are you right now?
1652739 1653911 We're dreaming?
1654074 1656520 You're in the middle of<br />the workshop, sleeping.
1656676 1659658 This is your first lesson in<br />shared dreaming. Stay calm

1661549 1663257 (RUMBLING)
1696991 1699131 If it's just a dream,<br />then why are you-?
1699295 1700695 ("NON, JE NE REGRETTE RIEN" PLAYING)
1700763 1702523 COBB: Because it's never<br />just a dream, is it?
1702665 1705977 And a face full of glass hurts like<br />hell When you're in it, it feels real.
1706136 1708344 ARTHUR: That's why the military<br />developed dream sharing.
1708506 1712215 It was a training program for soldiers<br />to shoot, stab and strangle each other.
1712376 1713515 And then wake up.
1713812 1715621 ARIADNE: How did architects<br />become involved?
1715781 1718524 COBB: Well, someone had to<br />design the dreams, right?
1719652 1721996 Why don't you give us<br />another five minutes?
1722155 1723260 Five minutes?
1723424 1724459 (MUSIC STOPS)
1724625 1726969 What? We were talking for,<br />like, at least an hour.
1727127 1729369 In a dream, your mind<br />functions more quickly.
1729531 1732375 Therefore time seems<br />to feel more slow.
1732534 1735914 Five minutes in the real world<br />gives you an hour in the dream.
1736639 1739712 Why don't you see what you can<br />get up to in five minutes?
1741712 1743191 (MACHINE HISSING)
1745617 1748565 COBB: You've got the basic<br />layout Bookstore, café.
1748721 1750394 Almost everything<br />else is here too.
1750556 1753503 - ARIADNE: Who are the people?<br />- Projections of my subconscious.
1753660 1754832 - Yours?<br />- Yes.
1754995 1757532 Remember, you are the dreamer<br />You build this world.
1757697 1760372 I am the subject. My<br />mind populates it.
1760534 1762445 You can literally talk<br />to my subconscious.
1762603 1765517 That's one of the ways we extract<br />information from the subject.
1765674 1766948 How else do you do it?
1767142 1771114 By creating something secure<br />like a bank vault or a jail.
1771281 1775025 The mind automatically fills it with<br />information it's trying to protect.
1775185 1777961 - You understand?<br />- Then you break in and steal it?
1778122 1779158 Well
1779324 1783830 I guess I thought that the dream space<br />would be all about the visual...
1783996 1785873 But it's more about<br />the feel of it.
1786332 1790475 My question is what happens when you start<br />messing with the physics of it all?
1792139 1794051 (RUMBLING THEN METAL GROANING)
1831820 1833390 It's something, isn't it?
1834490 1835798 Yes, it is.
1859719 1861280 ARIADNE: Why are they<br />all looking at me?
1861422 1864927 Because my subconscious feels that<br />someone else is creating this world.
1865093 1869405 The more you change things, the quicker<br />the projections start to converge on you.
1869564 1870635 Converge?
1870800 1872871 They sense the foreign<br />nature of the dreamer.
1873035 1875710 They attack, like white blood<br />cells fighting an infection.
1875873 1878717 - What, they're gonna attack us?<br />- No, no.
1879276 1880847 Just you
1882080 1883559 (METAL CREAKING)
1884749 1889028 This is great, but I'm telling you,<br />if you keep changing things like this.
1892526 1895508 Jeez, mind telling your<br />subconscious to take it easy?
1895663 1898337 It's my subconscious. Remember?<br />I can't control it.
1951997 1953374 Very impressive
1965112 1968651 I know this bridge. This<br />place is real, isn't it?
1968817 1971162 Yeah, I cross it every day<br />to get to the college.
1971320 1974767 Never re-create places from your<br />memory Always imagine new places.
1974924 1976768 You draw from stuff<br />you know, right?
1976927 1981137 Only use details. A streetlamp or<br />a phone booth. Never entire areas.
1981299 1983438 - Why not?<br />- Building a dream from your memory
1983601 1987106 is the easiest way to lose your grasp<br />on what's real and what is a dream.
1987273 1989344 Is that what happened to you?<br />Listen to me.
1989508 1991511 This has nothing to do<br />with me, understand?
1991678 1993658 That why you need me<br />to build your dreams?
1993813 1996350 Hey, get off of her.<br />Back up. Back up
1996517 1998155 Cobb! Cobb!<br />Get off of her!
1998319 2000265 Let me go!<br />Let me go! Mal!
2000755 2002861 Mal! Cobb!<br />Wake me up!
2003025 2004834 - Wake me up! Wake me up!<br />- No!
2004993 2006495 - Mal, no! No!<br />- Wake me up!
2006663 2007971 (GASPING)
2008131 2012103 Hey, hey, hey. Look at me You're okay.<br />You're okay.
2012269 2015512 - Hey.<br />- Why wouldn't I wake up?
2015806 2017411 There was still<br />time on the clock.
2017576 2020113 You can't wake up from within<br />the dream unless you die.
2020278 2021883 - She'll need a totem<br />- ARIADNE: What?
2022048 2023527 A totem, it's a small personal.
2023683 2026220 That's some subconscious<br />you've got on you, Cobb!
2026385 2028229 She's a real charmer Oh.
2028388 2031028 I see you met Mrs.<br />Cobb She's his wife?
2031191 2034935 Yeah. So a totem. You need a<br />small object, potentially heavy.
2035096 2037577 Something you can have on<br />you that no one else knows.
2037733 2039013 - ARIADNE: Like a coin?<br />- ARTHUR: No.
2039168 2043811 It needs to be more unique than<br />that Like, this is a loaded die.
2044908 2047822 No, I can't let you touch it.<br />That would defeat the purpose.
2047979 2052190 See, only I know the balance and the<br />weight of this particular loaded die.
2052351 2054194 That way, when you<br />look at your totem
2054353 2057460 you know beyond a doubt that<br />you're not in someone else's dream
2060893 2065206 I don't know if you can't see what's<br />going on, or if you just don't want to.
2065366 2068905 But Cobb has some serious problems<br />that he's tried to bury down there.
2069070 2073019 And I'm not about to just open<br />my mind to someone like that.
2077881 2078985 (DOOR CLOSES)
2079149 2082563 She'll he back. I've never seen anyone<br />pick it up that quickly before.
2083021 2087231 Reality's not gonna be enough for<br />her now and when she comes back...
2087893 2090567 When she comes back, you're<br />gonna have her building mazes.
2090729 2093006 - Where are you gonna be?<br />- I gotta go visit Eames.
2093166 2096306 Eames? No, he's in Mombasa<br />it's Cobol's back yard.
2096469 2098074 It's a necessary risk.
2098472 2101715 - Well, there's plenty of good thieves.<br />- We don't just need a thief.
2102844 2103879 We need a forger.
2112588 2115160 Rub them together all you<br />want they're not gonna breed.
2115726 2116761 You never know.
2117695 2119733 COBB: I'm gonna get you a drink.
2121900 2123278 You're buying.
2129743 2132053 - Your spelling hasn't improved.<br />- Piss off.

2134348 2136191 It's versatile Good.
2136350 2137590 Thank you very much.
2138253 2139630 Inception.
2139855 2142699 Now, before you bother telling<br />me it's impossible, let me-
2142858 2146170 No, it's perfectly possible<br />it's just bloody difficult.
2146329 2149607 Interesting. Because Arthur keeps<br />telling me it can't be done.
2150034 2153015 Hmm. Arthur. You still working<br />with that stick in the mud?
2153170 2154878 He is good at what<br />he does, right?
2155040 2157111 Oh, he's the best, but<br />he has no imagination.
2157275 2158311 Not like you.
2158478 2161459 Listen, if you're gonna perform<br />inception you need imagination.
2161614 2165188 Let me ask you something<br />Have you done it before?
2165352 2168994 We tried it. Uh, we got the idea<br />in place but it didn't take.
2169157 2172502 - You didn't plant it deep enough?<br />- No, it's not just about depth.
2172660 2174663 You need the simplest<br />version of the idea...
2174830 2178505 in order for it to grow naturally in<br />your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.
2178668 2181205 So, what is this idea<br />that you need to plant?
2181371 2185582 We need the heir of a major corporation<br />to dissolve his father's empire.
2185743 2188189 Right there you have various<br />political motivations
2188346 2190349 and anti-monopolistic<br />sentiments and so forth.
2190516 2192359 But all of that stuff, it's, um
2192518 2195398 it's really at the mercy of your<br />subject's prejudice, you see?
2195555 2198058 What you have to do is start<br />at the absolute basic.
2198224 2199795 Which is what?
2200294 2202205 The relationship with the father.
2204399 2206072 Do you have a chemist?<br />No, not yet.
2206234 2209307 Right. Okay, well, there's<br />a man here, Yusuf.

2382979 2386518 I tried not to come, but... But<br />there's nothing quite like it

2391356 2393859 Shall we take a look at some<br />paradoxical architecture?
2394026 2396028 ARTHUR: You're gonna have<br />to master a few tricks...
2396195 2399733 If you're gonna build three<br />complete dream levels. Excuse me.
2399899 2401345 ARIADNE: What kind of tricks?
2401502 2405006 In a dream, you can cheat<br />architecture into impossible shapes.
2405172 2409087 That lets you create closed<br />loops like the Penrose Steps.
2409944 2411947 The infinite staircase.
2414650 2416095 See?
2420257 2421327 Paradox.
2421492 2422903 So a closed loop like that
2423061 2426167 will help you disguise the<br />boundaries of the dream you create.
2426330 2428311 But how big do these<br />levels have to be?
2428467 2431608 It could be anything from the floor<br />of a building to an entire city.
2431771 2435218 They have to be complicated enough<br />that we can hide from the projections.
2435375 2436787 - A maze?<br />- Right, a maze.
2436944 2438287 And the better the maze.
2438479 2441153 Then the longer we have before<br />the projections catch us?
2441315 2442590 Exactly.
2443251 2446893 My subconscious seems polite enough Ha, ha.<br />You wait, they'll turn ugly.
2447056 2449969 No one likes to feel someone else<br />messing around in their mind.
2450126 2452232 Cobb can't build<br />anymore, can he?
2454064 2455907 I don't know if he<br />can't, but he won't.
2456066 2458479 He thinks it's safer if he<br />doesn't know the layouts
2458636 2459740 why?
2459904 2462146 He won't tell me. But<br />I think it's Mal.
2462575 2464885 His ex-wife?<br />No, not his ex.
2465044 2468219 - They're still together?<br />- No.
2469449 2470951 No, she's dead.
2472920 2475662 What you see in there is<br />just his projection of her.
2479194 2480673 What was she like in real life?
2481330 2482867 She was lovely.

2493945 2496186 No, I rarely go into the field, Mr.<br />Cobb.
2496348 2500092 Well, we'd need you there to tailor<br />compounds specific to our needs.

2509764 2513338 Not possible. That many dreams<br />within dreams is too unstable.
2513502 2517473 It is possible. You just<br />have to add a sedative.
2517641 2520315 A powerful sedative.
2522112 2524354 - How many team members?<br />- Five.

2580082 2584156 - How long do they dream for?<br />- YUSUF: Three, four hours, each day.
2584420 2585455 In dream time?
2585622 2589298 With this compound?<br />About 40 hours each and every day.
2589460 2592771 - Why do they do it?<br />- YUSUF: Tell him, Mr. Cobb.
2594299 2596745 After a while, it becomes<br />the only way you can dream.
2596901 2598848 Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?
2599472 2602885 - They come here every day to sleep?<br />- MAN: No.
2604611 2607319 They come to be woken up.
2608315 2611627 The dream has become<br />their reality.
2612553 2614932 Who are you to say<br />otherwise, sir?
2617226 2618865 Let's see what you can do
2626337 2627782 (METAL GROANING)
2629841 2631445 You know how to find me.
2634047 2636049 You know what you have to do.
2641288 2642358 Sharp, no?
2657941 2660786 SAITO: Are you all right, Mr.<br />Cobb?
2661312 2665090 Yeah, yeah.<br />Everything's just fine
2673526 2677236 Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer<br />Morrow energy conglomerate.
2677398 2679309 COBB: What's your problem with this Mr.<br />Fischer?
2679468 2681072 That's not your concern.
2681470 2685851 Mr. Saito, this isn't your<br />typical corporate espionage.
2686008 2687612 You asked me for inception
2687777 2691157 I do hope you understand the<br />gravity of that request.
2691315 2695287 Now, the seed that we plant in this<br />man's mind will grow into an idea.
2695453 2697330 This idea will define him.
2697489 2699332 It may come to change.
2699491 2701802 Well, it may come to change<br />everything about him.
2701961 2706308 We're the last company standing between<br />them and total energy dominance.
2706466 2708537 And we can no longer compete.
2708702 2712173 Soon, they'll control the energy<br />supply of half the world.
2712340 2714718 In effect, they become<br />a new superpower.
2716111 2719456 The world needs Robert<br />Fischer to change his mind.
2719615 2721186 EAMES: That's where we come in.
2721351 2724628 How is Robert Fischer's<br />relationship with his father?
2724788 2727531 Rumor is the relationship<br />is quite complicated.
2727691 2730195 Well, we can't work based<br />solely on rumor, can we?
2730362 2733571 Can you get me access to this man here?<br />Browning.
2733732 2737909 Fischer Senior's right-hand man<br />Fischer Junior's godfather.
2738070 2741348 It should be possible, if you<br />can get the right references.
2741508 2745980 References are something of a<br />specialty for me, Mr. Saito.
2746614 2749561 BROWNING: I'm not smelling settlement here.<br />Take them down.
2749717 2750822 LAWYER: Mr. Browning.
2750986 2754832 Maurice Fischer's policy is<br />always one of avoiding litigation.
2757394 2761866 Well, shall we voice your<br />concerns with Maurice directly?
2762033 2763444 Not sure that's necessary.
2763601 2766276 No, no, no. I think we should.
2787563 2789133 BROWNING How is he?
2789966 2792743 I don't want to bother him<br />unnecessarily, but...
2792903 2798377 MAURICE: Robert, I told you keep<br />out the damn-Wait. So do it. Get-
2798643 2801750 - NURSE: Mr. Fischer.<br />- MAURICE: Put it through.
2802114 2805721 Never, never. Never do<br />the same as I asked.
2807020 2808693 Leave that.
2812393 2813770 Here.
2816030 2818443 BROWNING: Must be a<br />cherished memory of his
2819535 2824076 I put it beside his bed.<br />He hasn't even noticed.
2824240 2825913 Ruben
2828279 2830691 we need to talk about<br />a power of attorney.
2830848 2834160 I know this is hard, but it's<br />imperative Not now, Uncle Peter.
2838157 2839966 EAMES: The vultures are circling.
2840126 2844542 And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,<br />the more powerful Peter Browning becomes
2844698 2847111 I've had ample opportunity<br />to observe Browning...
2847735 2852116 And adopt his physical presence, study<br />his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.
2852274 2856154 So now in the first layer of the<br />dream I can impersonate Browning.
2856312 2859556 And suggest concepts to<br />Fischer's conscious mind.
2859716 2861559 Then, when we take him<br />a level deeper...
2861719 2865223 his own projection of Browning<br />should feed that right back to him.
2865389 2867336 So he gives himself the idea.
2867492 2871737 Precisely. That's the only way it will<br />stick It has to seem self-generated.
2871898 2875311 Eames, I am impressed.
2875468 2879042 Your condescension, as always, is<br />much appreciated, Arthur, thank you
2891354 2892561 (DOOR OPENS)
2900398 2902401 Were you going<br />under on your own?
2902568 2906072 No, no, I was just, uh,<br />running some experiments.
2906238 2908219 I didn't realize<br />anyone was here, so.
2908375 2911049 Yeah, I was just-I was<br />working on my totem, actually.
2911211 2912384 Here, let me take a look.
2914548 2915856 So you're learning, huh?
2916017 2919522 An elegant solution for<br />keeping track of reality.
2920155 2922568 - Was it your idea?<br />- No, it was, uh...
2922792 2924863 It was Mal's, actually. This.
2925561 2929339 This one was hers. She would spin it<br />in the dream and it would never topple.
2929533 2932447 Just spin and spin
2933972 2935918 Arthur told me she passed away.
2937810 2939881 How are the mazes coming along?
2940046 2942960 Each level relates to the part<br />of the subject's subconscious.
2943116 2944595 That we are trying to access.
2944751 2950202 So I'm making the bottom level a hospital<br />so Fischer will bring his father.
2950558 2953335 You know, I-Actually, I have<br />a question about this layout.
2953495 2958241 No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.<br />Only the dreamer should know the layout.
2958401 2959573 Why is that so important?
2959736 2961738 In case one of us brings<br />in our projections.
2961905 2964250 We don't want them knowing<br />the details of the maze.
2965643 2968124 You mean in case<br />you bring Mal in.
2968280 2970692 You can't keep her out, can you?
2971583 2973120 - Right.<br />- You can't build
2973286 2976597 because if you know the<br />maze then she knows it.
2976756 2978964 Well, she'd sabotage<br />the whole operation.
2979126 2981936 Cobb, do the others know?<br />No. No, they don't.
2982096 2984338 You've gotta warn them if<br />this is getting worse.
2984499 2986445 No one said it's getting worse
2987635 2990947 I need to get home. That's<br />all I care about right now.
2991807 2993879 Why can't you go home?
2996980 2999018 Because they think I killed her.
3002253 3004530 Thank you For what?
3004723 3006999 For not asking whether I did
3007159 3009333 I will split up my<br />father's empire.
3009496 3013707 Now, this is obviously an idea that<br />Robert himself would choose to reject
3013868 3016678 which is why we need to plant<br />it deep in his subconscious.
3016837 3019668 The subconscious is motivated<br />by emotion, right?
3019694 3020401 Not reason.
3020542 3024320 We need to find a way to translate<br />this into an emotional concept.
3024480 3026926 How do you translate business<br />strategy into emotion?
3027083 3030691 That's what we're here to figure out<br />Robert's relationship with his father.
3030854 3033596 Is stressed, to say the<br />least Can we run with that?
3033758 3037365 We suggest breaking up his father's<br />company as a "screw you" to the old man.
3037529 3041000 No, because I think positive emotion<br />trumps negative emotion every time.
3041400 3045110 We all yearn for<br />reconciliation, for catharsis.
3045272 3049050 We need Robert Fischer to have a<br />positive emotional reaction to all this.
3049210 3051053 All right, well, try this. Um.
3051212 3055958 "My father accepts that I want to create<br />for myself, not follow in his footsteps."
3056351 3057421 That might work.
3057586 3060761 Might? We're gonna need to do<br />a little better than "might."
3060924 3062904 Thank you for your<br />contribution, Arthur.
3063059 3066007 Forgive me for wanting a<br />little specificity, Eames.
3066197 3067301 Specificity?
3067464 3069308 Inception's not about<br />being specific.
3069467 3073438 When we get inside his mind, we're<br />gonna have to work with what we find.
3074740 3077744 EAMES: On the top level, we open up<br />his relationship with his father...
3077910 3080983 and say, "I will not follow<br />in my father's footsteps."
3081148 3085825 Then the next level down, we feed him<br />"I will create something for myself."
3085987 3089333 Then, by the time we hit the bottom<br />level we bring out the big guns.
3089491 3091903 - "My father doesn't want me to be him."<br />- EAMES: Exactly.
3092061 3093096 (MACHINE HISSING)
3093262 3097268 Three layers down, the dreams are gonna<br />collapse with the slightest disturbance.
3097434 3098606 Sedation.
3098768 3101613 For sleep stable enough to create<br />three layers of dreaming...
3101772 3105687 we'll have to combine it with<br />an extremely powerful sedative
3106011 3107615 (MACHINE HISSING)
3117124 3118194 Good night.
3118792 3121000 YUSUF: The compound we'll be<br />using to share the dream...
3121162 3123108 Creates a clear connection<br />between dreamers...
3123265 3127510 whilst accelerating brain function.<br />In other words, more time on each level.
3127670 3130845 Brain function in the dream<br />will be about 20 times normal.
3131008 3134512 And when you enter a dream within<br />that dream, the effect is compounded
3134678 3136784 it's three dreams,<br />that's 10 hours times 20.
3136948 3139861 Math was never my strong<br />subject How much time is that?
3140019 3142693 It's a week, the<br />first level down.
3143389 3146234 Six months the second level<br />down and the third level-
3146393 3147838 That's 10 years.
3150464 3152637 Who'd wanna be stuck in<br />a dream for 10 years?
3153034 3154206 Depends on the dream.
3154368 3156679 So once we've made the<br />plant how do we get cut?
3156838 3160184 I'm hoping you have something more<br />elegant than shooting me in the head.
3160343 3163119 - A kick.<br />- What's a kick?
3163279 3165988 EAMES: This, Ariadne,<br />would be a kick
3168118 3170827 it's that feeling of falling<br />you get that jolts you awake.
3170989 3174232 - Snaps you out of the dream.<br />- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?
3174392 3175599 YUSUF: That's the clever part
3175761 3179004 I customized the sedative to leave<br />inner-ear function unimpaired.
3179165 3184013 That way, however deep the sleep<br />the sleeper still feels falling.
3184171 3186550 Or tipping.
3187175 3191352 The trick is to synchronize a kick<br />that can penetrate all three levels.
3191880 3195418 We could use a musical countdown to<br />synchronize the different kicks.

3203294 3206799 EAMES: He hasn't got any surgery<br />scheduled, no dental, nothing.
3206965 3208967 COBB: Wasn't he supposed<br />to have a knee operation?
3209134 3212378 Nothing. Nothing that they'll put<br />him under for, anyway. And we need.
3212538 3214484 We need at least a good 10 hours

3217311 3221590 One of the longest flights in the<br />world He makes it every two weeks.
3221750 3223923 He must be flying private, then.
3224419 3227594 SAITO: Not if there were unexpected<br />maintenance with his plane.
3227757 3229998 - ARTHUR: It would have to be a 747<br />- Why's that?
3230159 3231639 On a 747, the pilot's up top
3231795 3235004 the first-class cabin's in the<br />nose so no one would walk through.
3235165 3238670 You'd have to buy out the entire cabin<br />and the first-class flight attendant.
3238836 3240406 I bought the airline.
3241974 3243783 It seemed neater.
3245377 3248188 Well, looks like we<br />have our 10 hours.
3248848 3251989 Ariadne?<br />Terrific work, by the way

3300009 3302183 MAL: You know how to find me.
3303647 3305092 You know what you have to do.
3308920 3312391 You remember when you<br />asked me to marry you?
3313259 3315296 Of course I do.
3316395 3318899 You said you had a dream.
3321835 3324612 That we'd grow old together.
3326040 3327748 And we can.
3334417 3336363 COBB: You shouldn't be here.
3340124 3343595 Just wanted to see what kind of tests<br />you're doing on your own every night.
3343762 3346971 This has nothing to do with you.<br />This has everything to do with me.
3347132 3352948 - You've asked me to share dreams with you.<br />- Not these. These are my dreams.
3363819 3366231 ARIADNE: Why do you<br />do this to yourself?
3366389 3369337 It's the only way<br />I can still dream.
3371094 3373302 Why is it so important to dream?
3374199 3376475 In my dreams, we're<br />still together.
3390818 3392559 These aren't just dreams.
3394356 3397394 These are memories. And you<br />said never to use memories
3397559 3398630 I know I did.
3399262 3403803 You're trying to keep her<br />alive You can't let her go.
3403968 3406972 You don't understand. These<br />are moments I regret.
3407137 3409709 They're memories that<br />I have to change.
3410942 3413423 Well, what's down there<br />that you regret?
3413813 3416953 Listen, there's only one thing<br />you need to understand about me.

3427695 3430176 Mine and Mal's, yes.
3430332 3432039 Where is she?
3432701 3434704 She's already gone.

3458098 3460943 MAN: Right now or never, Cobb.
3465408 3467217 COBB: Then I start to panic
3467376 3470085 I realize I'm gonna<br />regret this moment
3470914 3473258 that I need to see their<br />faces one last time.

3484597 3486770 As I'm about to call out to them
3487801 3488905 they run away.

3688708 3692384 when we land, I go to<br />jail for the rest of my life.
3693047 3695254 Complete the job en route
3695416 3697897 I make one phone<br />call from the plane
3698053 3700966 you have no trouble<br />getting through Immigration
3714706 3717210 I'm sorry. Oh, yeah, absolutely.
3717376 3718946 Thank you.
3752551 3755862 Excuse me, I think this is yours?<br />You must have dropped it.
3756022 3757934 FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would<br />you care for a drink?
3758091 3759399 Oh. Water, please.
3759559 3761869 Oh, um, same, please
3762830 3764138 um.
3764866 3765970 Thank you.
3766134 3768012 You know, I couldn't<br />help but notice
3768170 3771777 but you wouldn't happen to be related<br />to the Maurice Fischer, would you?
3771940 3773443 Yes, he, um.
3774377 3776379 He was my father.
3776813 3780853 Well, he was a very inspiring<br />figure I'm sorry for your loss.
3783822 3785495 Here you go Thank you.
3785657 3787000 COBB Hey.
3787392 3789031 To your father.
3789629 3791870 May he rest in peace, huh?

3860347 3862657 Couldn't have peed before you went under?<br />Sorry.
3862816 3864888 Bit too much free<br />champagne before takeoff?
3865052 3866156 Ha, ha, bloody ha.
3866320 3869302 We know he's gonna be looking<br />for a taxi in this weather.
3880971 3885011 - Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try-?<br />- Walk away.
3897124 3899469 (MAN SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ON RADIO)
3899627 3900731 (TURNS OFF RADIO)
3900895 3902306 Just have him ca-I gotta go.
3902463 3904603 All right. Taxi. Thank you.
3907536 3910416 All right, Third and Market.<br />Snappy.
3910974 3913318 - What are you doing?<br />- Sorry, I thought it was free
3913476 3914979 it's not. Maybe we could share.
3915146 3917990 Maybe not. Can you pull<br />over and get this-?
3920953 3922296 Great.
3927227 3928706 Come on.
3939809 3942449 There's $500 in there. The<br />wallet's worth more than that.
3942612 3944319 You might at least<br />drop me at my stop
3944481 3945585 I'm afraid that it doesn't

3948585 3950259 (TIRES SCREECHING)
3955294 3957103 - Cover him!<br />- EAMES: Down! Down now!
3957263 3958901 What the hell is going on?
3962636 3964878 ARIADNE: This wasn't<br />in the design
3965806 3967183 Cobb?
3967408 3968443 Cobb?
3973916 3975487 (GUNFIRE)
4012128 4013266 (YELLS)
4019370 4020577 Get him!
4027246 4028691 Are you all right?
4028881 4031055 Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.
4031218 4033129 Fischer's okay, unless<br />he gets carsick.
4033287 4034527 Saito?
4053444 4055583 COBB: Get Fischer in<br />the back room now.
4055881 4058589 - Get him in the back room. Move.<br />- ARTHUR: What the hell happened?
4059018 4060497 COBB: Has he been shot?<br />Is he dying?
4060652 4062394 - ARTHUR: I don't know.<br />- Jesus Christ.
4062555 4065001 - ARTHUR: What happened to you?<br />- Blocked by a freight train.
4065158 4067139 Why put a train in a<br />downtown intersection?
4067294 4068974 - I didn't.<br />- ARTHUR: Where'd it come from?
4069063 4070736 Why the hell were we ambushed?
4070899 4074312 Those were not normal projections.<br />They'd been trained, for God's sakes.
4074469 4077041 How could he be trained?<br />Fischer's had an extractor
4077206 4081417 teach his subconscious to defend itself<br />so his subconscious is militarized.
4081578 4083216 It should've shown<br />in the research.
4083380 4085189 - COBB: Why the hell didn't it?<br />- Calm down.
4085349 4086693 COBB: Don't tell<br />me to calm down!
4086851 4089798 This was your job, goddamn it!<br />This was your responsibility!
4089954 4092026 You were meant to check<br />Fischer's background!
4092191 4095536 - We are not prepared for this!<br />- We have dealt with sub-security before!
4095694 4097800 We'll be more careful and<br />we're gonna be fine!
4097964 4099773 This was not a part of the plan!<br />He's dying.
4099933 4101003 Put him out his misery.
4101168 4104013 No, don't do that!<br />Don't do that Cobb, hey, hey.
4104172 4106277 He's in agony. I'm waking him up.
4106442 4108353 No. It won't wake him up.
4108510 4112118 What do you mean, it won't wake him up?<br />When we die in a dream, we wake up.
4112282 4113556 Not from this.
4113716 4116253 We're too heavily sedated<br />to wake up that way.
4116854 4118561 Right. Sc, what<br />happens when we die?
4118722 4120565 - We drop into limbo.<br />- Are you serious?
4120724 4123262 - Limbo?<br />- ARTHUR: Unconstructed dream space.
4123428 4126706 - ARIADNE: Well, what the hell is down there?<br />- Just raw, infinite subconscious.
4126866 4130075 Nothing is down there, except for<br />what might have been left behind...
4130236 4133150 By anyone sharing the dream<br />who's been trapped there before.
4133307 4135218 Which, in our case, is just you.
4135375 4138084 - How long could we be stuck?<br />- YUSUF: Can't even think about
4138246 4140658 trying to escape until<br />the sedation How long?
4140815 4144059 Decades. It could be infinite. Ask<br />him, he's the one who's been there.
4144220 4145426 ARTHUR: Let's get him upstairs
4145588 4146897 (GROANING)
4147057 4148502 Great.
4149493 4150972 Thank you.
4151661 4154905 So now we're trapped in Fischer's<br />mind battling his own private army.
4155066 4156545 And if we get killed
4156701 4159945 we'll be lost in limbo till our<br />brains turn to scrambled egg, hmm?
4166846 4168690 ARTHUR: Someone got first aid?
4170951 4174422 - You knew these risks and didn't tell us?<br />- There weren't meant to be risks.
4174589 4177537 - I didn't know we'd be dealing<br />with gunfire - You had no right.
4177693 4180037 This was the only way<br />to go three layers deep.
4180196 4182234 You knew about this and<br />went along with it?
4182399 4183434 I trusted him.
4183600 4185511 When? When he promised<br />you half his share?
4185669 4188947 No. His whole share. Besides,<br />he said he'd done it before.
4189107 4191178 What, with Mal?<br />Because that worked so good?
4191342 4194790 That has nothing to do with it. I did<br />what I had to, to get to my children.
4194947 4196858 You led us into a war<br />zone with no way cut?
4197016 4201056 There is a way cut. We continue on with the<br />job, and we do it as fast as possible...
4201221 4203566 And we get out using the<br />kick just like before.
4203724 4206204 Forget it. We go any deeper<br />we just raise the stakes.
4206360 4208238 I am sitting this one<br />out on this level.
4208397 4210843 COBB: Fischer's security<br />is surrounding this place.
4210999 4213276 Ten hours of flight time<br />is a week at this level.
4213436 4217179 That means each and every one of us will<br />be killed. That I can guarantee you.
4217775 4221552 We have no other choice but to continue<br />on and do it as fast as possible.
4223148 4225594 Downwards is the<br />only way forwards.
4227152 4228291 Get ready.
4228454 4230661 You, come on. Let's<br />go shake him up
4235495 4238534 I'm insured against kidnapping<br />for up to 10 million.
4238700 4241647 - This should be very simple.<br />- COBB: Shut up! It won't be.
4241803 4244080 ARTHUR: In your father's office<br />below the bookshelves...
4244240 4246311 is his personal safe.<br />We need the combination
4246475 4247510 (SIGHS)
4247676 4249088 I don't know any safe.
4249279 4252158 COBB: That doesn't mean you<br />don't know the combination.
4253784 4255127 Tell us what it is
4255987 4257728 I don't know.
4262661 4264801 We have it on good<br />authority you do know.
4264964 4267308 Yeah? Whose authority?
4268802 4272306 - Five hundred dollars, this cost.<br />- EAMES: What's inside it?
4272573 4276351 Cash, cards, ID. And this.
4281384 4282886 Useful?
4283620 4284655 Maybe.
4285122 4286931 You're on. You've got an hour.
4287324 4288359 An hour?
4289661 4291937 I was supposed to have<br />all night to crack this.
4292096 4294703 And Saito wasn't supposed<br />to be shot in the chest.
4294867 4298041 You've got one hour, now get<br />us something useful, please
4298905 4300407 (SCREAMING)
4300573 4303019 - What's that?<br />- Good authority
4307248 4308956 Uncle Peter.
4309651 4311790 Just make them stop.
4312087 4314432 The combination I don't know it.
4314590 4317264 - Why does Browning say you do?<br />- I don't know.
4317427 4319908 Just let me talk to him<br />and I'll find cut.
4322266 4324975 You have one hour. Start talking.
4326971 4328177 FISCHER: You all right?
4328340 4329911 (GROANING)
4330076 4331384 You okay?
4335082 4338757 Those bastards have had<br />at me for two days.
4339420 4341900 They have someone with access<br />to your father's office.
4342056 4343933 - They're trying to open his safe.<br />- Yeah.
4344093 4346835 They thought I'd know the<br />combination but I don't know it.
4346995 4349738 - Yeah, well, neither do I, so.<br />- What?
4350500 4353743 Maurice told me that when he passed<br />you were the only one able to open it.
4353903 4356441 No, he never gave<br />me any combination.
4357174 4361317 Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you just<br />didn't know it was a combination.
4361480 4362686 Well, what, then?
4362848 4365386 I don't know, some meaningful<br />combination of numbers...
4365551 4369500 Based on your experiences<br />with Maurice.
4371191 4375140 We didn't have very many, uh,<br />meaningful experiences together.
4375864 4377343 Perhaps after your mother died.
4380002 4382141 After my mother died, you<br />know what he told me?
4384437 4389410 "Robert, there's really<br />nothing to be said."
4389577 4391922 Oh, well, he was<br />had with emotion
4392080 4394789 I was 11, Uncle Peter.
4395551 4398794 How's he doing?<br />He's in a lot of pain.
4398955 4402563 When we get down to the lower levels<br />the pain will be less intense.
4402726 4403966 And if he dies?
4405130 4406609 Worst-case scenario?
4406765 4409473 When he wakes up, his<br />mind is completely gone
4409634 4413708 Cobb, I'll still honor<br />the arrangement.
4413873 4415581 COBB: I appreciate that, Saito.
4415742 4419815 But when you wake up, you won't even<br />remember that we had an arrangement.
4419980 4422018 Limbo is gonna<br />become your reality.
4422183 4425961 You're gonna be lost down there so long<br />that you're gonna become an old man.
4426422 4427765 Filled with regret?
4429191 4430296 Waiting to die alone.
4430960 4432064 O
4432629 4434267 I'll come back.
4435065 4437740 And we'll be young<br />men together again.
4443709 4444779 Breathe.
4444943 4447982 These people are gonna kill us if<br />we don't give them the combination.
4448147 4450058 They just wanna ransom<br />us I heard them.
4450216 4454131 They're gonna lock us in that van<br />and then drive it into the river.
4454288 4455768 All right. What is in the safe?
4456858 4458030 Something for you
4458660 4462803 Maurice always said it was his<br />most precious gift to you.
4463532 4466605 - A will.<br />- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.
4466770 4468010 That's an alternate.
4468171 4470549 This would supersede the<br />other if you want it to.
4470708 4473348 It splits up the component<br />businesses of Fischer Morrow.
4473511 4477221 It'd be the end of the<br />entire empire as we know it.
4477383 4479863 Destroying my whole inheritance?
4481521 4484695 - Why would he suggest such a thing?<br />- I just don't know.
4487561 4489541 He loved you, Robert.
4490097 4491736 In his own way.
4491900 4493709 FISCHER: In his own way.
4495003 4496540 At the end
4497673 4500017 he called me into his deathbed.
4500510 4502354 He could barely speak.
4503414 4507659 But he took the trouble<br />to tell me one last thing.
4510155 4511794 He pulled me close.
4514460 4516566 And I could only make out
4517431 4518876 one word.
4522570 4524550 Disappointed
4528710 4530018 (SIGHS)
4530179 4531386 When were you in limbo?
4532949 4536454 You might have the rest of the team<br />convinced to carry on with this job.
4536620 4538998 But they don't know the truth Truth?<br />What truth?
4539190 4543333 The truth that, at any minute, you might<br />bring a freight train through the wall.
4543495 4547569 The truth that Mal is bursting<br />through your subconscious.
4547733 4550145 And the truth that, as we<br />go deeper into Fischer
4550303 4552113 we're also going deeper into you.
4552940 4556217 And I'm not sure we're<br />gonna like what we find.
4560215 4561695 We were working together.
4561851 4565526 We were exploring the concept<br />of a dream within a dream.
4565721 4566996 I kept pushing things
4567157 4570832 I wanted to go deeper and<br />deeper I wanted to go further.
4571328 4576210 I just didn't understand the concept that<br />hours could turn into years down there...
4576367 4579110 That we could get<br />trapped so deep
4579938 4583250 that when we wound up on the<br />shore of our own subconscious...
4583843 4586380 We lost sight of what was real.
4592454 4595025 We created. We built the<br />world for ourselves.
4596658 4598661 We did that for years.
4599795 4601775 We built our own world.
4603133 4604840 How long were you stuck there?
4606003 4608109 Something like 50 years
4611509 4612682 Jesus.
4614980 4616323 How could you stand it?
4616482 4619125 It wasn't so had at first<br />feeling like gods.
4619179 4620918 The problem was knowing<br />that none of it was real.
4620946 4625356 Eventually, it just became<br />impossible for me to live like that.
4625519 4626921 And what about for her?
4630392 4634300 She had locked something away,<br />something deep inside her.
4635699 4640943 A truth that she had once<br />known, but chose to forget.
4643876 4646381 Limbo became her reality.
4647714 4649517 What happened when you woke up?
4650050 4653724 Well, to wake up from that<br />after years, after decades...
4654790 4659299 to become old souls thrown<br />back into youth like that?
4660195 4663970 I knew something was wrong with her.<br />She just wouldn't admit it.
4665337 4667607 Eventually, she<br />told me the truth.
4668039 4671413 She was possessed by an idea.
4671577 4677289 This one very simple idea<br />that changed everything.
4678419 4680891 That our world wasn't real.
4681824 4686099 That she needed to wake up<br />to come back to reality...
4686629 4689001 that in order to<br />get back home...
4690234 4692036 we had to kill ourselves.
4698678 4702152 - What about your children?<br />- She thought they were projections...
4702315 4705321 that our real children were<br />waiting for us up there somewhere.
4705486 4707189 - MAL: I'm their mother!<br />- COBB: Calm down.
4707354 4708624 I can tell the difference.
4708791 4711128 If this is my dream, why<br />can't I control this?
4711293 4712995 You don't know you're dreaming!
4713161 4715367 COBB: She was certain there<br />was nothing I could do...
4715532 4719374 no matter how much I begged,<br />no matter how much I pleaded.
4722340 4725380 She wanted to do it, but<br />she could not do it alone.
4725544 4732058 She loved me too much, so she came<br />up with a plan on our anniversary.
4758118 4760924 - Sweetheart, what are you doing?<br />- Join me.
4761089 4765365 Just-Just step back inside. All right?<br />Just step back inside now, come on.
4765528 4769971 No. I'm going to jump, and<br />you're coming with me.
4770134 4771837 No, I'm not.
4772003 4774107 Now, you listen to me.
4774707 4777809 If you jump, you're not<br />gonna wake up, remember?
4777835 4778973 You're gonna die.
4779111 4781049 Now, just step back inside.
4781215 4783953 Come on. Step back inside<br />so we can talk about this.
4784118 4786056 We've talked enough.
4788123 4789793 - Mal.<br />- Come out onto the ledge...
4789960 4792664 - or I'll jump right now.<br />- Okay.
4796934 4798737 We're gonna talk about this.
4799605 4800773 All right?
4800939 4806017 - I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.<br />- No, honey.
4806981 4809988 No, I can't. You know<br />I can't do that.
4810152 4812924 Take a second, think<br />about our children.
4813089 4814827 Think about James.
4815558 4817194 Think about Phillipa, now.
4817360 4820300 If I go without you, they'll<br />take them away anyway.
4820464 4823771 - What does that mean?<br />- I filed a letter with our attorney...
4824201 4827542 explaining how I'm<br />fearful for my safety.
4829775 4831913 How you've threatened<br />to kill me.
4834714 4837353 - Why did you do this?<br />- I love you, Dom.
4837518 4839288 Why did?<br />Why would you do this to me?
4839453 4842326 I've freed you from the guilt<br />of choosing to leave them.
4842491 4845532 We're going home to<br />our real children.
4845696 4848123 Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you<br />listen to me, all right?
4848149 4849361 Mal, look at me, please?
4849500 4850803 You're waiting for a train.
4851303 4854876 - Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!<br />- A train that will take you far away.
4855041 4857045 James and Phillipa<br />are waiting for you!
4857210 4861052 You know where you hope this train will<br />take you, but you can't know for sure.
4861215 4863419 - Mal, look at me!<br />- But it doesn't matter.
4863584 4866792 - Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!<br />- Because you'll be together.
4866956 4870798 Sweetheart!<br />Look at me! Mal, no!
4870961 4872398 Jesus Christ!
4875901 4879642 She had herself declared sane by<br />three different psychiatrists.
4879805 4884015 It made it impossible for me to try<br />to explain the nature of her madness.
4884178 4885413 So I ran.
4885579 4887082 (CHILDREN GIGGLING)
4887248 4889486 MAN: Right now, or never, Cobb.
4895859 4900501 WOMAN: James! Phillipa!<br />Come on in! Come on!
4900765 4901833 All right, let's go.
4902367 4906175 I left my children behind and I've been<br />trying to buy my way back ever since.
4906740 4910614 Your guilt defines her.<br />It's what powers her.
4910778 4914084 But you are not responsible for<br />the idea that destroyed her.
4915315 4917888 And if we are gonna<br />succeed in this...
4918053 4923031 you have to forgive yourself, and<br />you're gonna have to confront her.
4923193 4925030 But you don't have<br />to do that alone.
4925195 4927466 - No, you're not...<br />- I'm doing it for the others.
4928133 4933244 Because they have no idea the risk<br />they've taken coming down here with you.
4938312 4939814 We have to move.
4939980 4941417 Time's up.
4941583 4944322 All right. I don't<br />know any combination.
4944486 4947593 - Not consciously, anyway.<br />- COBB: How about instinctively, huh?
4947757 4951699 I got somebody in your father's office<br />right now ready to tap in the combination.
4951863 4954768 Give me the first six numbers<br />that come to your head right now.
4954933 4957171 - I have no idea.<br />- Right now!
4957336 4959574 I said, right now!<br />Right now!
4959739 4963647 Five, two, eight,<br />four, nine, one.
4967515 4969518 You'll have to do<br />better than that.
4969684 4973025 All right. Bag them.<br />You're going for a ride.
4977394 4981536 FISCHER: We're worth more to you alive.<br />You hear me?
4986806 4988309 What'd you get?
4988708 4991246 Relationship with his father<br />is worse than we imagined.
4991411 4992447 This helps us how?
4992613 4995719 The stronger the issues, the<br />more powerful the catharsis.
4996919 5000025 - How are we gonna reconcile them?<br />- I'm working on that.
5000189 5003730 Work faster. The projections<br />are closing in quick.
5003894 5007469 We gotta break out of here<br />before we're totally boxed in.
5042576 5043611 Damn it.
5043778 5046783 You mustn't be afraid to dream<br />a little bigger, darling.
5063535 5066540 We need to shift his animosity<br />from his father to his godfather.
5066706 5070748 - Destroy his one positive relationship?<br />- No, repair his relationship with his father...
5070911 5073216 whilst exposing his<br />godfather's true nature.
5073381 5076387 We should charge Fischer a lot<br />more than Saito for this job.
5076551 5078923 His security is gonna get<br />worse as we go deeper.
5079088 5081594 - I think we run with Mr. Charles.<br />- No.
5081992 5083432 - EAMES: Who's Mr. Charles?<br />- Bad idea.
5083595 5087135 The second we get into that hotel his<br />security's gonna be all over us.
5087299 5089404 We run with Mr. Charles<br />like on the Stein job.
5089568 5091928 - You've done it before?<br />- ARTHUR: Yeah, and it didn't work.
5092072 5095580 The subject realized he was dreaming and<br />his subconscious tore us to pieces.
5095743 5097780 Excellent. But you<br />learned a lot, right?
5097945 5100050 - I need some kind of distraction.<br />- EAMES: No problem.
5100216 5102420 How about a lovely lady<br />that I've used before?
5102584 5104655 Listen to me. You drive<br />carefully, all right?
5104821 5107293 Everything down there is<br />gonna be unstable as hell.
5111830 5115204 Don't jump too soon. We only got one<br />shot at that kick. We gotta make it.
5115368 5118676 I'll play the music to let you know<br />it's coming. The rest is on you.
5118839 5120642 - You ready?<br />- Ready!
5121875 5122977 Sweet dreams.
5123143 5125047 WOMAN: Am I boring you?
5126348 5129555 I was telling you my story. I<br />guess it wasn't to your liking.
5131388 5134061 Um, I have a lot on my mind.
5135592 5137195 There goes Mr. Charles.
5141900 5144539 Mr. Fischer, right?
5144704 5148211 Pleasure to see you again.<br />Rod Green from marketing. I-
5148375 5149512 Hmm.
5149678 5152350 - And you must be?<br />- Leaving.
5155585 5156720 In case you get bored.
5161960 5163329 Must've blown you off.
5163495 5166234 That is, unless her phone number<br />really is only six digits.
5168401 5172843 Funny way to make friends, someone<br />stealing your wallet like that.
5175544 5176612 (SCOFFS)
5176777 5179116 Goddamn it. The wallet alone<br />is worth at least 500-
5179282 5180417 About $500, right?
5180583 5183556 Don't worry about it. My people<br />are already on it as we speak.
5183720 5185658 Who or what is Mr. Charles?
5185856 5189564 It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer<br />against his own subconscious.
5189728 5191089 ARIADNE: And why<br />don't you approve?
5191230 5193233 It involves telling the<br />mark that he's dreaming...
5193399 5195537 which involves attracting<br />a lot of attention to us.
5195701 5198640 - Didn't Cobb say never to do that?<br />- Hmm.
5198804 5200575 So now you've noticed<br />how much time...
5200741 5203379 Cobb spends doing things<br />he says never to do.
5205114 5206884 Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?
5207049 5209488 - I'm sorry, but...<br />- MAN: Hold on! Wait!
5210820 5212122 You look a bit perkier.
5212289 5214627 Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

5220867 5222370 Turbulence on the plane?
5222536 5224239 No, it's much closer.

5234418 5236890 Um, I'm sorry. Who did<br />you say you were?
5237054 5239159 COBB: Rod Green from marketing.
5239323 5240926 But that's not true<br />at all, is it?
5243028 5246502 My name is Mr. Charles. You<br />remember me, don't you?
5246699 5248669 I'm the head of your<br />security down here.
5249937 5251874 Get out on a different<br />floor, keep moving.
5252039 5254376 Dump the wallet. Security<br />will be looking for that.
5254543 5258050 - Okay.<br />- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.
5259848 5261051 (COUGHING)
5261685 5263255 Security, huh?
5265690 5267861 - You work for the hotel?<br />- No, no.
5268026 5272636 I specialize in a very<br />specific type of security.
5273032 5274702 Subconscious security.
5274867 5276972 You're talking about dreams?
5277137 5280009 Are you talking about,<br />um, extraction?
5281042 5282445 I am here to protect you.

5295895 5298432 Mr. Fischer, I'm here to<br />protect you in the event...
5298599 5301973 that someone tries to access<br />your mind through your dreams.
5302136 5304774 You're not safe here.
5305608 5307211 They're coming for you.
5319524 5320961 (YELLS)
5325565 5327603 Strange weather, isn't it?
5332440 5333575 You feel that?
5335544 5336747 What's happening?
5336913 5340152 Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention<br />to the strangeness of the dream...
5340316 5343189 which is making his<br />subconscious Look for the dreamer.
5343353 5346427 For me. Quick, give me a kiss.
5351431 5355305 - They're still looking at us.<br />- Yeah, it was worth a shot.
5355969 5358008 We should probably<br />get out of here.
5362212 5363314 (GUNFIRE)
5373292 5376866 COBB: You feel that? You've actually<br />been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.
5377029 5381037 Pay attention to the strangeness of<br />the weather, the shift in gravity.
5381201 5384374 None of this is real.<br />You're in a dream.
5389178 5391415 Now, the easiest way for<br />you to test yourself...
5391616 5395690 is to try and remember how you<br />arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?
5396521 5397823 Yeah, I...
5397989 5400527 COBB: No, breathe, breathe.<br />Remember your training.
5400692 5405870 Accept the fact that you're in a dream,<br />and I'm here to protect you. Go on.
5407869 5409238 Mm-hm.
5412040 5413877 - You're not real?<br />- No.
5414042 5417417 No. I'm a projection<br />of your subconscious.
5417581 5419685 I was sent here to protect<br />you in the event...
5419850 5422756 that extractors tried<br />to pull you into a dream.
5422920 5426161 And I believe that's what's going<br />on right now, Mr. Fischer.
5427260 5428295 Yeah.
5428461 5429563 Okay.
5430463 5431699 Okay.
5434536 5436539 Can you get me out of here?
5437440 5440044 Right away. Follow me.
5454260 5455595 Hold on a second.
5460535 5462373 Jesus Christ!<br />What are you doing?
5462538 5464808 These men were sent here<br />to abduct you, all right?
5464973 5467546 If you want my help, you<br />have to remain calm.
5469279 5471583 I need you to work with me, Mr.<br />Fischer.
5483296 5486903 If this is a dream, I should just<br />kill myself to wake up, right?
5487066 5489172 I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr.<br />Fischer.
5489337 5492844 I believe they have you sedated,<br />and if you pull that trigger...
5493009 5494178 you may not wake up.
5495312 5499621 You may go into a further dream state.<br />Now, you know what I'm talking about.
5501954 5503625 You remember the training.
5504758 5506160 Remember what I said to you.
5507026 5508195 Give me the gun.
5520010 5522614 - This room should be directly below 52$?<br />- Yeah.
5523882 5525317 (SAFE BEEPS)
5531991 5533495 Think, Mr. Fischer, think.
5533660 5537501 What do you remember<br />from before this dream?
5537864 5540503 There was, um, a lot of gunfire.
5540668 5543274 There was rain.
5543807 5545409 Uncle Peter.
5545675 5549315 - Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.<br />- Where were they holding you?
5552348 5555622 - They had us in the back of a van.<br />- That explains the gravity shifts.
5555821 5557891 You're in the back of a van.<br />Keep going.
5558056 5560328 It had something<br />to do with, um...
5560960 5563834 Something to do with a safe.
5564466 5566102 God, why is it so<br />hard to remember?
5566267 5568973 It's like trying to remember a<br />dream after you've woken up.
5569138 5570875 Listen, it takes<br />years of practice.
5571041 5573446 You and Browning have been<br />pulled into this dream...
5573611 5576383 because they're trying to<br />steal something from your mind.
5576547 5580121 I need you to focus and try<br />and remember what that is.
5580285 5581920 What is it, Mr. Fischer?<br />Think!
5582088 5585829 A combination. They demanded the<br />first numbers to pop into my head.
5585993 5588731 They're trying to extract a<br />number from your subconscious.
5588897 5592671 It can represent anything.<br />We're in a hotel right now.
5593467 5596608 We should try hotel rooms. What<br />was the number, Mr. Fischer?
5596772 5599612 Try and remember for me.<br />This is very important.
5599776 5601111 Five.
5602079 5604518 Five, two-It was something,<br />it was a long number.
5604682 5606786 That's good. We can start there.<br />Fifth floor.
5606951 5607987 Yep.
5608153 5612195 - So do you use a timer?<br />- No, I have to judge it for myself.
5612391 5615665 While you're all asleep in<br />52$, I wait for Yusuf's kick.
5615830 5617967 - Well, how will you know?<br />- His music warns me.
5618132 5622074 And then when the van hits the barrier of<br />the bridge, that should be unmistakable.
5622236 5625444 So we get a nice<br />synchronized kick.
5625608 5628012 If it's too soon, we<br />won't get pulled out.
5628178 5631451 But if it's too late, I<br />won't be able to drop us.
5631615 5635424 - Well, why not?<br />- Because the van will be in freefall.
5635956 5638795 - Can't drop you without gravity.<br />- Right.
5644433 5646670 They're with me. Go on.
5670999 5672034 Mr. Charles.
5672201 5675174 - Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?<br />- Yeah, I think so.
5675338 5677408 They were trying<br />to put you under.
5677840 5679912 - I'm already under.<br />- Under again.
5680078 5682650 What do you mean, a<br />dream within a dream?
5683247 5685720 Hey. I see you've changed.
5685884 5687520 I'm sorry?
5688020 5691895 Oh, I'm sorry. I mistook<br />you for a friend.
5692058 5693327 Oh.
5693493 5695631 Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.
5696297 5699236 No, no, no. That's Fischer's<br />projection of Browning.
5699400 5701272 Let's follow him and<br />see how he behaves.
5701437 5703407 - Why?<br />- Because how he acts will tell us...
5703573 5706914 if Fischer is starting to suspect<br />his motives the way we want him to.
5707078 5708113 Shh.
5708279 5709715 (DOOR OPENS)
5712685 5715189 - Uncle Peter.<br />- You said you were kidnapped together?
5715355 5718794 Well, not exactly. They already had him.<br />They were torturing him.
5718959 5720430 And you saw them torture him?
5727971 5729808 The kidnappers are<br />working for you?
5730775 5732244 Robert.
5732409 5736251 You're trying to get that safe open?<br />To get the alternate will?
5736648 5740890 Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.<br />I can't let you destroy it.
5741054 5743426 I'm not gonna throw<br />away my inheritance.
5743589 5747764 I couldn't let you rise to<br />your father's last taunt.
5748562 5751602 - What taunt?<br />- The will, Robert. That will?
5751767 5753704 That's his last insult.
5753869 5757510 A challenge for you to build<br />something for yourself...
5757674 5761482 by telling you you're not<br />worthy of his accomplishments.
5767153 5772532 - What, but that he was, um, disappointed?<br />- I'm sorry.
5773895 5777002 But he's wrong.
5777734 5780372 You can build a better<br />company than he ever did.
5780536 5782974 Mr. Fischer? He's lying.
5783140 5785245 - How do you know?<br />- Trust me, it's what I do.
5785409 5788182 He's hiding something, and we<br />need to find out what that is.
5789381 5792788 I need you to do the same thing to<br />him that he was going to do to you.
5795355 5799430 We'll enter his subconscious and find<br />out what he doesn't want you to know.
5800695 5802165 All right.
5802564 5803866 (MACHINE HISSING)
5808139 5809407 - COBB: He's out.<br />- Wait.
5809572 5811643 Whose subconscious are<br />we going into exactly?
5811809 5813145 We're going into Fischer's.
5813311 5816016 I told him it was Browning's<br />so he'd be a part of our team.
5816181 5818519 He's gonna help us break<br />into his own subconscious.
5818684 5820253 COBB: That's right.

6797146 6799184 I couldn't shoot her.
6799850 6803224 There's no use in reviving him. His<br />mind's already trapped down there.
6803388 6804457 It's all over.
6806191 6807827 So that's it, then?<br />We failed?
6808462 6810632 We're done. I'm sorry.
6814503 6817141 It's not me that doesn't get<br />back to my family, is it?
6817839 6821747 Shame. I wanted to know what was gonna<br />happen in there. I swear we had this.
6821911 6823982 Let's set the charges.
6825816 6827318 No, there's still another way.
6828621 6832027 - We have to follow Fischer down there.<br />- Not enough time.
6832191 6835030 No, but there will be<br />enough time down there.
6836163 6837265 And we will find him.
6837431 6841373 Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,<br />just use the defibrillator to revive him.
6841536 6844442 We can give him his<br />own kick down below.
6845474 6847177 Look, you get him in there.
6847342 6850215 As soon as the music ends,<br />you blow up the hospital...
6850381 6853185 and we all ride the<br />kick back up the layers.
6854386 6859163 It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold the<br />guards off while I set the charges.
6859325 6861429 Saito will never<br />make it, will he?
6862728 6865936 - Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.<br />- Go for it.
6866100 6869040 If you are not back before the kick,<br />I am gone with or without you.
6869204 6872444 She's right. She's right.<br />Come on. Let's go.
6876681 6878885 Can I trust you to do what<br />needs to happen here?
6879050 6880253 Mal's gonna be down there.
6880419 6882856 I know where to find her.<br />She'll have Fischer.
6883021 6886929 - How do you know?<br />- Because she wants me to come after him.
6887093 6889264 She wants me back<br />down there with her.
6916029 6917064 All right?
6924306 6926978 - This is your world?<br />- It was.
6927777 6929715 And this is where she'll be.

7085309 7087647 Places from our past.
7087812 7089582 That was our first apartment.
7089748 7091987 Then we moved to that<br />building right there.
7092151 7094689 After Mal became pregnant,<br />that became our home.
7094855 7097661 You reconstructed all<br />of this from memory?

7100260 7101864 ARIADNE: What is that?
7103399 7105168 That's the house Mal grew up in.
7105334 7107772 - Well, will she be in there?<br />- No.

7109305 7112645 We both wanted to live in a house,<br />but we loved this type of building.

7201354 7204127 MAL: The smallest idea, such as:
7204725 7207097 "Your world is not real."
7207361 7211136 Simple little thought<br />that changes everything.
7212367 7216877 So certain of your world.<br />Of what's real.

7357416 7361692 no matter how confused,<br />that guilt is always there...
7361856 7364394 reminding me of the truth.
7364894 7366196 What truth?
7368631 7373875 That the idea that caused you to<br />question your reality came from me.
7377242 7380383 You planted the idea in my mind?
7381881 7383384 What is she talking about?
7384284 7389561 The reason I knew inception was possible<br />was because I did it to her first.
7390592 7393565 - I did it to my own wife.<br />- Why?
7394296 7395800 We were lost in here.
7396733 7401376 I knew we needed to escape,<br />but she wouldn't accept it.
7404575 7410254 She had locked something<br />away, something deep inside.
7411018 7415159 A truth that she had once<br />known, but chose to forget.
7416124 7418261 And she couldn't break free.
7420963 7423702 So I decided to search for it.
7424268 7429146 I went deep into the recess of her<br />mind and found that secret place.
7429308 7431212 And I broke in...
7431777 7433948 and I planted an idea.
7434680 7438455 A simple little idea that<br />would change everything.
7443692 7446064 That her world wasn't real.
7458878 7462085 That death was the only escape.
7469491 7471262 You're waiting for a train.

7484776 7486312 Yet it doesn't matter.
7487747 7490919 - Now, tell me why!<br />- Because you'll be together!
7495257 7499333 COBB: But I never knew that that idea<br />would grow in her mind like a cancer...
7499496 7501902 that even after she woke...
7504802 7507274 That even after you<br />came back to reality...
7510209 7513182 that you'd continue to<br />believe your world wasn't real.
7515949 7518355 That death was the only escape.
7518520 7521192 Mal, no! Jesus!
7521356 7525064 - You infected my mind.<br />- I was trying to save you.
7525228 7526630 You betrayed me.
7527464 7531171 But you can make amends. You<br />can still keep your promise.

7654757 7657863 He's here! And it's time,<br />but you have to come now!
7658028 7661702 - COBB: You take Fischer with you, all right?<br />- You can't stay here to be with her.
7664269 7666974 I'm not. Saito's dead by now.
7667139 7670647 That means he's down here somewhere.<br />That means I have to find him.
7672646 7675753 I can't stay with her anymore,<br />because she doesn't exist.
7675916 7679324 I'm the only thing you<br />do believe in anymore.
7679489 7680824 No.
7681991 7683426 I wish.
7685028 7687532 I wish more than<br />anything, but...
7688634 7691372 I can't imagine you with<br />all your complexity...
7691537 7694075 all your perfection,<br />all your imperfection.
7695174 7696209 - You all right?<br />- Yeah.
7696376 7698213 Look at you.
7699447 7704392 You're just a shade. You're<br />just a shade of my real wife.
7704820 7707458 And you were the best<br />that I could do, but...
7708291 7710730 I'm sorry, you're<br />just not good enough.
7710895 7712531 Does this feel real?
7712963 7714099 (GUNSHOT)
7714933 7717538 - What are you doing?<br />- Improvising.
7721808 7723043 (GASPING)
7726147 7727849 No, no, no!
7728817 7731222 In there, now. Go, go, go.
7776077 7777980 I was dis-
7779682 7782019 I was dis-Disa-
7782885 7785424 - I know, Dad.<br />- Dis-
7791429 7793533 I know you were disappointed...
7794332 7795702 I couldn't be you.
7796102 7797604 No.
7798104 7799339 No, no, no.
7800374 7802377 I was disappointed...
7804111 7806049 that you tried.
7823168 7824470 (BEEPING)
7829309 7830980 What?
7840424 7841560 Come on, come on.
7871797 7873299 Dad?
7875100 7876136 (SOBBING)
7911647 7914720 That's the kick, Ariadne!<br />You have to go now!
7927567 7931007 Don't lose yourself!<br />Find Saito and bring him back!
7931171 7932841 I will!
7972590 7975762 You remember when you<br />asked me to marry you?
7975926 7977030 Yes.
7977195 7980268 You said you dreamt that<br />we'd grow old together.
7982971 7984473 But we did.
7986406 7988779 We did. You don't remember?
7993450 7996289 I miss you more<br />than I can bear...
7998656 8000659 but we had our time together.
8001994 8004065 And I have to let you go.
8006165 8007969 I have to let you go.
8059232 8060535 I'm sorry, Robert.
8082427 8083930 (ARTHUR YELLS)
8088202 8091877 You know, the will means that Dad<br />wanted me to be my own man...
8092941 8094979 not just to live for him.
8096578 8099117 That's what I'm gonna<br />do, Uncle Peter.
8108894 8110130 What happened?
8110596 8112299 - Cobb stayed.<br />- With Mal?
8112464 8113733 No, to find Saito.
8116003 8117774 He'll be lost.
8120309 8122146 No, he'll be all right.
8138165 8140136 SAITO: Have you come to kill me?
8144405 8146877 I'm waiting for someone.
8151348 8154120 COBB: Someone from a<br />half-remembered dream.
8156854 8158257 Cobb?
8158990 8160026 (SCOFFS)
8160193 8161963 Impossible.
8162494 8165100 We were young men together.
8166700 8169037 I'm an old man.
8170271 8172342 Filled with regret.
8175478 8178183 Waiting to die alone.
8181352 8183522 I've come back for you.
8186793 8190668 To remind you of something.
8193934 8196307 Something you once knew.
8199175 8201413 That this world is not real.
8206317 8210827 To convince me to honor<br />our arrangement?
8211657 8214428 To take a leap of faith, yes.
8220535 8221870 Come back...
8224406 8227780 so we can be young<br />men together again.
8231548 8233518 Come back with me.
8236621 8238056 Come back.
8247801 8249504 FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Hot towel, sir?
8250138 8253011 We'll be landing in Los<br />Angeles in about 20 minutes.
8253175 8255481 Do you need immigration forms?
8257581 8258917 Thank you.
8259383 8261020 Hot towel, sir?
8262020 8265025 - No.<br />- Do you need immigration forms?
8336415 8337483 Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.
8338616 8340252 Thank you, sir.
8384307 8385676 Welcome.
8386142 8387545 This way.
8408737 8412212 MILES: James? Phillipa?
8415946 8417215 Look who's here.
8422822 8423890 Hey.
8424991 8427697 - Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?<br />- PHILLIPA: Daddy! Daddy!
8427861 8430132 - JAMES: Daddy!<br />- COBB: How are you?
8431232 8432835 Look what I've been building!
8433002 8436708 - What are you building?<br />- JAMES: We're building a house on the cliff!
8436872 8439745 COBB: On the cliff? Come on, I want<br />you to show me. Can you show me?
8439910 8442482 - JAMES: Let's go.<br />- PHILLIPA: Come on, Daddy!
