2426505 2428049 HAVE TO BE?
2428091 2430260 WELL, IT COULD BE ANYTHING
2428091 2430260 FROM THE FLOOR OF A BUILDING
2430301 2431719 TO AN ENTIRE CITY.
2431761 2433221 BUT THEY HAVE TO BE
2431761 2433221 COMPLICATED ENOUGH

2452615 2455701 WELL, I DON'T KNOW
2452615 2455701 IF HE CAN'T, BUT HE WON'T.
2455743 2458079 HE THINKS IT'S SAFER
2455743 2458079 IF HE DOESN'T KNOW THE LAYOUTS.
2458121 2459830 WHY?
2458121 2459830 HE WON'T TELL ME.
2459872 2461749 BUT I THINK IT'S MAL.
2461791 2463293 HIS EX-WIFE?
2463334 2464335 NO, NOT HIS EX.
2464377 2465920 THEY'RE STILL TOGETHER?
2465962 2468672 NO...
2468714 2469840 SHE'S DEAD.
2472509 2474470 WHAT YOU SEE IN THERE
2472509 2474470 IS JUST HIS PROJECTION OF HER.

2510965 2512383 THAT MANY DREAMS WITHIN DREAMS
2510965 2512383 IS TOO UNSTABLE.
2512425 2514802 IT IS POSSIBLE.

2593172 2596384 AFTER A WHILE, IT BECOMES
2593172 2596384 THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DREAM.
