76641 79644 of one single<br />law enforcement officer.

106106 107629 <i>Good to see you, Pat.</i>
107759 111807 Thank you for<br />this unprecedented access<br />to your operations.
111937 115376 Could you walk us through<br />what we're seeing here?
115506 117856 <i>Well, this is</i><br /><i>a routine operation.</i>
117987 120337 <i>We found that</i><br /><i>random patrols</i>
120468 123253 <i>helped the local population</i><br /><i>to feel safer</i><br /><i>and to trust us.</i>
123384 124515 It's amazing.
124646 127039 And what are<br />these colored dots
127170 128519 that we're seeing here,<br />General?
128650 131566 <i>These are our assets</i><br /><i>on the ground.</i>
131696 134482 <i>In green,</i><br /><i>we got the ED-209s.</i>

470470 476127 Why is America<br />so robophobic?
476258 478608 On the one hand,<br />we have Raymond Sellars.
480044 483308 An entrepreneur<br />and true American
483439 486486 whose product just saved<br />my colleague's life.
486616 488575 And on the other.
488705 491491 Hubert Dreyfus.
491621 495886 A man with<br />both feet planted<br />firmly in the past
496017 499977 whose bill prohibits<br />the use of drones<br />on US soil.
500108 503372 The American people<br />support the Dreyfus Act
503503 506810 because they haven't<br />experienced this technology
506941 510727 and they fear<br />what they don't understand.

2600162 2603383 The machine assesses<br />the threat and acts.
2604297 2605994 That's it.
2606125 2609694 It's two steps.<br />Now watch Alex.
2609824 2613915 The software<br />assesses the threat,<br />just like the robot.
2614046 2616091 And it sends the information<br />to the brain.
2616222 2618877 Alex's brain receives<br />the information and<br />decides what to do with it
2619007 2623664 based on his emotional<br />cognitive abilities<br />like any man would.
2623795 2626885 Then the brain relates this<br />to the AI module and...
2627015 2629757 Yeah, like, you know,<br />a year later.
2629888 2630932 DR. NORTON: And our computers<br />finish the job.

2647645 2649647 Something aspirational, right?

2660788 2663878 Just get him to do that.<br />Get him to do that.
2664009 2665663 That is a machine.
2665793 2667099 I know, but it's a man<br />inside a machine.

3062798 3063799 Crap!

3799012 3802973 This man has torn<br />apart American families.
3803103 3805976 On the loose for six years.
3807934 3812504 And where was this<br />criminal mastermind hiding?
3816160 3821208 Right in front of<br />the police headquarters.
3821339 3825822 Here he is, just steps away<br />from two of Detroit's finest.
3825952 3829738 These two officers<br />are completely unaware
3829869 3832480 of the monster<br />in their midst.
3835266 3837746 [CROWD SCREAMING]And then, in 60 seconds...
3837877 3841925 I repeat, just 60 seconds,
3842055 3845972 Detective Murphy<br />brings him down.

3863120 3864512 Yes,
3864643 3869517 let's not shy away<br />from what this means, people.
3869648 3873521 Men weren't up to the task.
3873652 3875175 But Alex Murphy,
3875306 3877134 <i>a robot cop,</i>
3877264 3878004 <i>was.</i>
3879963 3881007 We can't take him<br />off the street.
3881138 3882748 This is what I'm saying.<br />He's a hit.
3882879 3884706 A big, fat, stinking hit.
3884837 3887100 Yeah, until he breaks down<br />in front of everyone.
3887231 3890669 Hey, we all knew<br />there would be issues.<br />It's inevitable.
3890799 3892976 Dennett, you're my guy.<br />I just need you<br />to get a handle on this.
3893106 3894281 I know,<br />but I need more time.
3894412 3896936 Scientifically,<br />we're in uncharted water.
3897067 3899286 We need to take him<br />back to the lab<br />and do more tests.
3899417 3902550 I mean,<br />it was like something was<br />interfering with our system.
3902681 3904857 Something beyond<br />chemistry or physics.
3904988 3907120 Like what? His soul?
3907251 3909731 Hey, look, this train has<br />already left the station.
3909862 3911951 I can't exactly go out<br />to the world and say,
3912082 3915041 "Sorry, I released<br />a defective product."
3915172 3917696 So, no matter what we do,<br />we just need to keep him<br />on the streets.
3917826 3919176 What about the interviews?
3919306 3921656 Cancel 'em.<br />Cancel all of 'em.

3934234 3935801 Can you arrange that?
3935932 3938325 Look, I won't lie to you.
3938456 3941981 Alex was so nervous,<br />we had to sedate him.
3942112 3944984 I looked in his eyes and<br />I couldn't see my husband.
3945115 3948031 And then he just shoots<br />a man in front of our son.<br />That's not sedation.
3949858 3952600 He's responding<br />to drugs differently now.
3954951 3957823 We both knew from day one,
3957954 3959912 there would be complications.
3964830 3966440 Just give me<br />a little more time.

4265652 4267915 You must be doing<br />a victory lap about now.
4268046 4269700 Well.
4269830 4273312 Two weeks ago,<br />Omni's stock went<br />through the roof.
4273443 4275575 And the Senate<br />has finally agreed
4275706 4277795 to vote on the repeal<br />of the Dreyfus Act.

4284192 4286238 I certainly hope so.
4286369 4288458 But, I think<br />our next guest will have<br />a different point of view.

4290111 4291548 Hubert Dreyfus.
4291678 4293506 Senator,<br />thank you for joining us.
4293637 4295378 <i>Hello, Pat.</i><br /><i>Mr. Sellars.</i>
4295508 4298076 Senator, do you know<br />what this is?
4298206 4300644 The American public<br />is divided
4300774 4302602 on the Dreyfus Act.
4302733 4308086 Our polls at Novakelement.com<br />are tight at 50-50.
4308216 4311437 <i>There is no doubt</i><br /><i>Omnicorp created a sensation</i>
4311568 4315354 <i>but this bill is</i><br /><i>not about Alex Murphy.</i>
4315485 4318270 <i>It's about whether America's</i><br /><i>willing to give robots</i>
4318401 4319924 <i>the authority</i><br /><i>over human lives.</i>
4320054 4321578 No. Look, look, look.
4321708 4324145 This sea change<br />we're witnessing,
4324276 4325756 and it is a sea change,
4325886 4327758 shows that Americans<br />don't really care
4327888 4330630 if our law enforcement systems<br />are manned or unmanned.
4330761 4333372 What they care about<br />is efficiency and<br />they care about safety.
4333503 4334721 <i>You're clouding the issue.</i>
4334852 4336636 <i>This is clearly an attempt</i>
4336767 4339030 <i>to sway public opinion</i><br /><i>with a marketing stunt.</i>
4339160 4340901 What's clear is
4341032 4344165 that with just<br />one system in place,<br />we've cut crime by 80%.
4344296 4346342 Just imagine if we put,
4346472 4348605 I dunno, let's say<br />100 systems in place.
4348735 4350520 And then,<br />I want you to ask yourself,
4350650 4352652 why are you holding us back?
4352783 4354175 <i>Is that your plan?</i>Thank you, Senator.
4354306 4356047 And thank you, Raymond.Thank you, Pat.

4359355 4361226 Who could argue with that?
