59060 62814 What if I told you that even the<br />worst neighborhood in America
62897 64983 could be made completely safe.
65150 68069 And what if I told you that<br />this could be accomplished
68153 69362 without risking the life
69446 72323 of one single<br />law enforcement officer.
72490 73908 How do I know this?
73992 76202 Because it's happening right now
76286 78580 in every country in the world

90842 92886 we'll be joined<br />by General Curtis Monroe
92969 95180 live from the War Room<br />in the Pentagon.
96848 98683 General Monroe, welcome back.
98808 99934 <i>Good to see you, Pat.</i>
100018 104355 Thank you for this unprecedented<br />access to your operations.
104522 108151 Could you walk us through<br />what we're seeing here?
108318 110528 <i>Well, this is<br />a routine operation.</i>
110653 112781 <i>We found that random patrols</i>
112864 116242 <i>helped the local population to<br />feel safer and to trust us.</i>
116326 117327 It's amazing.
117452 119746 And what are these colored dots
119829 121331 that we're seeing here, General?
121498 124417 <i>These are our assets<br />on the ground.</i>
124501 127086 <i>In green,<br />we got the ED-209s.</i>
127170 129881 <i>They're the big boys.<br />They secure the perimeter.</i>
130048 132217 <i>Purple are<br />the smaller EM-208s.</i>
132300 133843 <i>They sweep and mop up.</i>
134010 136888 <i>And the red dots, Pat,<br />that's your film crew.</i>
136971 138097 (LAUGHS)
138640 141100 It is great to see<br />American machines
141184 144479 helping to promote<br />peace and freedom abroad.
144562 146314 <i>All right, you guys, this is<br />a standard op, all right?</i>
146397 147774 <i>There's no opposition expected.</i>
147857 150026 <i>I'm gonna set your markers<br />to code red.</i>

230440 231482 Incredible.

234068 238323 Not long ago, that would have<br />been American men and women
238406 241576 risking their lives<br />to pacify these people.
242660 244871 General, you care<br />to comment on this?
244954 247415 <i>Well, Pat, we had Vietnam,</i>
247498 250293 <i>we had Iraq, we had Afghanistan.</i>
250835 252045 <i>Never again.</i>
252128 255590 <i>From a military perspective,<br />this has been invaluable.</i>

468886 471889 On the one hand,<br />we have Raymond Sellars.
472807 475977 An entrepreneur<br />and true American
476060 479230 whose product just saved<br />my colleague's life.
479522 481607 And on the other.
481691 484110 Hubert Dreyfus.
484193 488239 A man with both feet<br />planted firmly in the past
488489 492702 whose bill prohibits the<br />use of drones on US soil.
492869 495913 The American people<br />support the Dreyfus Act

866867 868953 That's up to IAD.
869411 870913 I'll handle it.
876585 881257 I don't care how sophisticated<br />these machines are, Mr. Sellars.
881465 885970 A machine does not know what<br />it feels like to be human.
886136 888514 It can't understand<br />the value of human life.
888597 890099 Why should it be<br />allowed to take one?
890182 891183 (APPLAUSE)
891308 894687 To legislate<br />over life and death,
894770 898566 we need people who<br />understand right from wrong.
898899 900985 What do your machines feel?
901151 904613 Well, they feel no anger.<br />They feel no prejudice.
904780 909326 They feel no fatigue, which makes<br />them ideal for law enforcement.
910327 913497 Putting these machines<br />on the streets
913664 916667 will save countless<br />American lives.
916834 918794 DREYFUS: You're evading the question.<br />No, I'm not.
918836 919878 DREYFUS: Yes,<br />you're evading the question.
919962 923424 I asked what do<br />these machines feel?
923591 926427 If one of them killed a child,
927511 928971 what would it feel?
929054 930306 (SIGHS)
932600 934476 Nothing.<br />And that's the problem.
934643 939940 That's why 72% of Americans will not<br />stand for a robot pulling the trigger.
940024 941859 (APPLAUSE)
946780 950909 POPE: America is the world's most<br />valuable market, and we can't touch it.
951201 956498 With a domestic expansion, we'd<br />clear $600 billion per annum.
956665 961545 In other words, every second that law is<br />in existence, we are hemorrhaging money.
961712 962752 What do you want me to do?
962880 966216 We've thrown cash at senators at both<br />sides of the aisle. Nobody's budging.
966383 968383 They don't want to vote<br />against their constituents.
968469 971513 So unless we sway public<br />opinion, the battle's lost.
971680 973641 Now, to that effect,
973807 978062 my team have come up with a<br />pretty aggressive new campaign.
978228 980731 Wow factor<br />off-the-charts.
980898 983734 We need to give Americans<br />a product they can love.
984068 985736 A figure they can rally behind.
985903 988906 Sir, I have dissected this bill.<br />There are no loopholes.
989073 990741 We can't put a machine<br />on the streets.
990824 992034 SELLARS: Forget machines.

2230021 2232148 <i>I can go get him.<br />No.</i>
2233482 2235693 I don't want him<br />to see me like this.
2237862 2238946 Not yet.
2239238 2240323 <i>Sure.</i>
2246203 2248706 <i>We're gonna<br />get through this, baby.</i>
2251417 2253794 <i>We're gonna make it like it was.</i>
2258341 2259842 <i>When are you comin' home?</i>
2260009 2262345 Well, they've still<br />got some tests.
2263429 2265556 But they're sayin'<br />it's goin' really well.
2267475 2268976 The minute they let me.
2271395 2272939 I gotta go.
2274065 2275358 I love you.
2275524 2277151 End the connection.
2291540 2295378 Okay, blood cleansing initiated.

2346991 2348991 MATTOX: All right, here's<br />what you're dealin' with.
2349015 2351559 Modified M2 battle rifle.
2351726 2354103 .50 caliber Beowulf<br />ammunition at 30 round clips.
2354228 2356022 Three-shot bursts<br />or full auto.
2357356 2358399 Heavy-duty.
2359734 2362862 TSR 66. Cartridge-driven<br />taser pistol.
2363029 2367366 Each projectile releases up to 200,000<br />volts. It can stun, it can kill
2367533 2368909 and it's nasty shit.
2369285 2370327 Your armor,
2370411 2371746 state-of-the-art,<br />but not invulnerable.
2371912 2374457 .50 caliber or larger<br />can penetrate and kill.
2374623 2378335 Multiple hits, and guess who<br />ends up in the recycling bin?
2380671 2382551 If you sense you need a<br />weapon or are threatened
2384550 2387678 the visor goes down and the system<br />makes the weapons available.
2387845 2390723 But you gotta remember, it's<br />not the weapons that count.
2390806 2391849 It's who's handling them.
2391932 2394143 Or, in your case, what.
2394560 2397063 You think you can do this?<br />Oh, just stick to your job.
2397188 2400024 Just stick to my job?<br />Combat robots are my job, Doc.
2400191 2404278 Rio, Congo, you name it, I was there.<br />Our machines run perfectly.
2404445 2406489 You ask me, stickin'<br />organics into the system
2406572 2408657 is a huge step backwards.
2409116 2411035 I don't care how well you<br />designed this thing.
2411202 2413496 Without my sign-off, it better<br />start learnin' Chinese,
2413579 2415039 'cause it ain't<br />never goin' home.
2422588 2424465 It's nice to meet you, too.
2425883 2427468 Let's do this,

2439605 2442525 Rendering scenario one now.
2443359 2444985 Hey, Doc, hope you don't mind.

2519101 2520603 <i>Let the kid go!<br />MATT OX: Too bad.</i>
2522146 2526108 Well, there you have it. 5.6<br />seconds behind. Scenario failure.
2526275 2528152 I wouldn't buy that<br />for a dollar.
2533616 2536035 Let's do it again.<br />Your funeral.
2539830 2540915 Detective Alex Murphy.

2563854 2566941 <i>Unfortunately, Murphy's<br />investigation into Antoine Vallon</i>
2567024 2568464 <i>wasn't authorized<br />in the first place.</i>
2568525 2572238 <i>Look, Detective Murphy was<br />simply overzealous, okay?</i>
2572321 2575449 <i>We have absolutely no evidence linking<br />Vallon to the attempt on his life.</i>
2575532 2577826 <i>All I'm gonna say is<br />my partner's a great cop.</i>
2577910 2581413 <i>And I won't rest until the men who tried<br />to kill him are brought to justice.</i>
2585153 2586353 SELLARS:<br />What's wrong with him?
2586377 2587657 DR. NORTON:<br />No, nothing, nothing.
2588629 2592049 Watch the procedural bars<br />on the 208.
2592925 2596428 The machine assesses<br />the threat and acts.
2597054 2598430 That's it.
2598931 2601308 It's two steps.<br />Now watch Alex.
2602351 2606438 The software assesses the<br />threat, just like the robot.
2606605 2608482 And it sends the information<br />to the brain.
2608649 2611402 Alex's brain receives the information<br />and decides what to do with it
2611485 2616115 based on his emotional cognitive<br />abilities like any man would.
2616282 2619451 Then the brain relates this<br />to the Al module and...
2619618 2622329 Yeah, like, you know,<br />a year later.
2622413 2623622 DR. NORTON: And our computers<br />finish the job.
2623747 2627459 Raymond, you wanted<br />a man inside a machine.
2627543 2629128 And that's what you've got.
2629211 2631338 But the human element<br />will always be present.
2631422 2634008 Fear, instinct,<br />bias, compassion,
2634091 2635342 they will always interfere<br />with the system!
2635426 2636969 Okay, but, Dennett, (SIGHS)
2637052 2640472 I've gotta give the American people<br />something they can root for.
2640556 2642308 Something aspirational, right?
2642391 2643809 They have to<br />believe in this thing.
2643976 2647396 "Pretty good"? I don't<br />know how to sell "okay."
2647479 2649106 We, you and I,<br />have got a release date,
2649189 2650607 and we've gotta make it, okay?
2650691 2653277 So I don't care how you do it. I'm<br />askin' ya, come on, can you help me?
2653360 2656822 Just get him to do that.<br />Get him to do that.
2656905 2658324 That is a machine.
2658407 2659867 I know, but it's a man<br />inside a machine.
2659950 2662828 No, that's a man<br />inside a machine right there!
2662911 2663996 And his life depends on it.
2664079 2665456 And the future of Omnicorp<br />depends on it
2665539 2668375 so get your ass back to China<br />and get it fixed.
2668459 2670627 I don't care how you do it,<br />just go do it!
2686101 2689188 It tastes like peanut butter.
2693150 2695319 I can't get it out of my mouth.
2696028 2697788 DR. NORTON: And you<br />don't like peanut butter?
2697946 2699156 No.<br />(CHUCKLES)
2699907 2701492 You like peanut butter, Kim?
2701658 2703077 KIM: I love it.
2704787 2706205 Okay.
2707247 2708832 I'm gonna put you<br />to sleep now, Alex.
2708916 2710000 Okay.
2711251 2713253 Now, put him under, Kim.
2714963 2716215 (BEEPING)
2718634 2720344 What are you planning to do?
2721303 2725224 Consciousness is nothing more
2725391 2728102 than the processing<br />of information.
2729645 2731480 I'm gonna fix him.
2732898 2734983 And he won't<br />know the difference.
2746328 2747913 Raymond?<br />Yeah?
2747996 2751458 We just ran focus groups<br />at Ryan Correctional Facility.
2752334 2755421 We call this Combat Mode.
2755587 2758298 It really put the fear of God<br />into the prisoners.
2758465 2759591 Yeah, that's okay.
2759758 2761510 And get a load of this.
2762261 2766098 What's that? He transforms.<br />Kids love it.
2766432 2768767 Really? Focus group<br />numbers through the roof.
2768934 2770269 (CHUCKLES) Really?<br />Oh, yeah.
2770436 2772396 Well, that's really<br />embarrassing.
2772563 2774523 What is this?<br />You know what?
2774690 2776525 People really don't know<br />what they want
2776608 2778819 until you show it to 'em<br />most of the time.
2779653 2781905 (SIGHS) Make him more, uh,
2781989 2782990 tactical.
2783073 2784616 Make him look, uh...
2786785 2788537 Let's go with black.
2789830 2791039 Yeah.
2826200 2827201 Alex.
2827367 2829453 He looks like a billion dollars.
2829620 2831580 2.6 billion.
2832039 2833749 Raymond Sellars.
2834082 2835959 I've looked forward to<br />meeting you, Detective.
2836043 2838128 I really appreciate everything<br />you've done for me.
2838212 2840422 Well, we funded this program
2840506 2842716 to give men like you<br />a second chance.
2843550 2845344 You just do your best today.
2845719 2846970 Shall we?<br />Let's.
2850098 2852559 Mr. Sellars, we're ready for you.<br />Okay, great.

2893934 2895134 DR. NORTON:<br />Alex, listen to me.
2895644 2897896 <i>The EM-208s will<br />try to maneuver you</i>
2897980 2899314 <i>so Mattox can get a clear shot.</i>

2918250 2919459 All right.
2920294 2922170 I say we go on three.
2922337 2923338 Three.
2945319 2946903 How's it going down there?
2949031 2952034 Whatever you do,<br />don't get shot in the face.
2955537 2956538 Wow.
2988737 2991531 LIZ: Dr. Norton,<br />how is he doing this?
2992324 2995827 DR. NORTON: His software is faster.<br />His hardware is stronger.
2995994 2997496 <i>He's a better machine.</i>
3000123 3002334 <i>LIZ: But you said<br />humans hesitate.</i>
3002501 3004795 Only when they're<br />making decisions.
3004878 3006838 He's not making decisions?
3007005 3008757 Yes and no.
3009132 3012052 In his everyday life,<br />man rules over the machine.
3012135 3014179 Alex makes his own decisions.
3014554 3016390 <i>Now, when he engages in battle,</i>
3016473 3019685 <i>the visor comes down<br />and the software takes over.</i>
3019851 3021812 <i>Then the machine<br />does everything.</i>
3021895 3025232 Alex is a passenger,<br />just along for the ride.
3028733 3030213 <i>LIZ: But if the machine<br />is in control,</i>
3030237 3031655 <i>then how is Murphy accountable?</i>
3031863 3032903 Who's pulling the trigger?
3032948 3034324 Well, when the machine fights,
3034408 3036910 the system releases signals<br />into Alex's brain
3036993 3039593 making him think he's doing what<br />our computers are actually doing.
3039663 3042499 I mean, Alex believes right<br />now he is in control.
3042582 3046044 But he's not. It's the<br />illusion of free will.
3055762 3056847 Crap!
3079202 3082202 So you've circumvented the law by creating<br />a machine that thinks it's a man.
3082205 3083206 But that's illegal.
3083373 3085167 No. No, no, no.
3086293 3088670 It's a machine that thinks<br />it's Alex Murphy.
3088837 3090130 And in my book
3090630 3092090 that's legal.
3094050 3095218 Well done.
3096762 3098263 Well done.
3101641 3106104 Hey, Doctor, what happens if I taste an<br />exoskeleton with a little asshole inside?
3107189 3110484 I, uh, I think we're all<br />curious to find out.

3464212 3465713 <i>preparing to come out...</i>
3466506 3471845 Alex, we're gonna upload the entire<br />DPD database into your brain.
3472554 3476808 That means you'll have instantaneous<br />access to criminal records
3476891 3481062 plus an archive of CCTV footage<br />from 2011 to the present.
3481229 3482230 All right.

3564312 3566064 KAREN: No. That's<br />his own crime scene.

3625832 3628084 KIM: Heart rate rising. He<br />might start spiking, Doctor.
3628167 3630795 DR. NORTON: Set modules to absorb<br />dopamine and noradrenalin.
3630878 3632046 But you will be<br />taking away his emotions.
3632130 3633881 Drop the levels<br />until I tell you to stop.
3633965 3635967 Doctor, you'll be taking away<br />his ability to feel anything.

3784031 3787743 Until today, Thomas King<br />was a convicted felon
3787827 3791372 wanted for rape, arson,<br />and murder.
3791664 3795543 This man has torn<br />apart American families.
3795960 3799255 On the loose for six years.
3800465 3805553 And where was this<br />criminal mastermind hiding?
3808723 3813686 Right in front of<br />the police headquarters.
3813853 3818399 Here he is, just steps away<br />from two of Detroit's finest.
3818566 3822487 These two officers<br />are completely unaware
3822570 3825573 of the monster in their midst.
3827867 3830453 (CROWD SCREAMING)<br />And then, in 60 seconds...
3830578 3834540 I repeat, just 60 seconds,
3834707 3838211 Detective Murphy<br />brings him down.

3856062 3857188 Yes,
3857271 3861776 let's not shy away<br />from what this means, people.
3862276 3866197 Men weren't up to the task.
3866364 3867823 But Alex Murphy,
3868199 3870159 a <i>robot cop,</i>
3870243 3871285 <i>was.</i>
3872578 3873871 We can't take him<br />off the street.
3873955 3875498 This is what I'm saying.<br />He's a hit.
3875581 3877291 A big, fat, stinking hit.
3877375 3879627 Yeah, until he breaks down<br />in front of everyone.
3879710 3882922 Hey, we all knew there would be issues.<br />It's inevitable.
3883089 3885675 Dennett, you're my guy. I just<br />need you to get a handle on this.
3885758 3886918 I know, but I need more time.
3886968 3889470 Scientifically,<br />we're in uncharted water.
3889554 3891722 We need to take him<br />back to the lab and do more tests.
3891806 3895226 I mean, it was like something was<br />interfering with our system.
3895309 3897728 Something beyond<br />chemistry or physics.
3897895 3899730 Like what? His soul?
3899814 3902316 Hey, look, this train has<br />already left the station.
3902400 3904694 I can't exactly go out<br />to the world and say,
3904777 3907280 "Sorry, I released<br />a defective product."
3907446 3910324 So, no matter what we do, we just<br />need to keep him on the streets.
3910491 3912076 What about the interviews?
3912159 3914579 Cancel 'em.<br />Cancel all of 'em.
3914745 3916080 Everything.
3916789 3918499 In fact, Dennett.

3925006 3926446 <i>CLARA: (QUIETLY)<br />I'd like to see him.</i>
3927133 3928467 Can you arrange that?
3928634 3930469 Look, I won't lie to you.
3931012 3934432 Alex was so nervous,<br />we had to sedate him.
3934599 3937268 I looked in his eyes and<br />I couldn't see my husband.
3937351 3941314 And then he just shoots a man in front<br />of our son. That's not sedation.
3942481 3945651 He's responding<br />to drugs differently now.
3947653 3949989 We both knew from day one,
3950656 3953159 there would be complications.
3957455 3959498 Just give me a little more time.
3960458 3962043 I promise,
3963169 3965171 you'll have your husband back.
3967381 3971177 KAREN: This goes for every<br />squad in every department.
3971344 3974805 Detective Murphy will have full<br />access to all investigations.

3977683 3980144 If he requests<br />to take over a case,
3980227 3981812 the case will be handed to him.

4257254 4258255 Thanks for havin' me.
4258422 4260925 You must be doing<br />a victory lap about now.
4261008 4262009 Well.
4262092 4266013 Two weeks ago, Omni's stock<br />went through the roof.
4266138 4268432 And the Senate<br />has finally agreed
4268515 4270476 to vote on the repeal<br />of the Dreyfus Act.

4277107 4278108 I certainly hope so.

4288327 4290621 Senator, do you know<br />what this is?
4290788 4293540 The American public is divided
4293666 4295042 on the Dreyfus Act.
4295209 4300339 Our polls at Novakelement.com<br />are tight at 50-50.
4300547 4304301 <i>There is no doubt<br />Omnicorp created a sensation</i>
4304385 4307805 <i>but this bill is<br />not about Alex Murphy.</i>

4314561 4317064 This sea change<br />we're witnessing,
4317147 4318565 and it is a sea change,
4318649 4320317 shows that Americans<br />don't really care
4320401 4323153 if our law enforcement systems<br />are manned or unmanned.
4323237 4326281 What they care about is efficiency<br />and they care about safety.

4327700 4329243 <i>This is clearly an attempt</i>

4331912 4333247 What's clear is
4333414 4336875 that with just one system in<br />place, we've cut crime by 80%.

4339086 4341296 I dunno, let's say<br />100 systems in place.

5675921 5677673 These men are here to kill us.

5685097 5686807 <i>SELLARS:<br />Mrs. Murphy, last night,</i>
5686891 5688893 Alex had a psychotic break.
5688976 5693272 He killed an unarmed colleague<br />and later suffered a seizure.
5694398 5695900 We did everything,
5695983 5698903 everything, we could, but the<br />doctors couldn't save him.
5700363 5702406 Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.
5702698 5705242 We're going to be making<br />the announcement shortly.
5705701 5708162 You shut me down. I was<br />about to get a confession.
5708788 5710456 Mattox shut you down.
5711791 5714668 I've removed your transmitter<br />so he won't do it again.
5715086 5717254 Sellars can't afford<br />to wake you up.
5718297 5720424 He sent these guys<br />to pull the plug.
5720883 5724387 He wants you dead, Alex.<br />Do you understand?
5724553 5726389 Sorry. If there's<br />anything we can do
5726472 5727807 for you and David, we'll do it.
5727973 5730101 I want nothing from you.
5731060 5732353 I understand.
5732937 5735231 You stay out of our lives.
5736649 5737858 You and your company.
5738150 5740027 If that's what<br />you think is best.
5740986 5742446 There's one more thing.
5742530 5745366 I think it would be to the benefit<br />of everyone, especially David
5745449 5747660 if we kept this matter private.
5747910 5750454 We don't wanna<br />damage Alex's legacy.

5755334 5756961 I can fix this!

6566519 6570899 Now I know some of you may think that<br />this kind of thinking is dangerous
6570982 6574986 and these machines<br />violate your civil liberties.
6575153 6579282 Some of you even believe that the<br />use of these drones overseas
6579366 6584037 makes us the same kind of<br />bullying imperialists
