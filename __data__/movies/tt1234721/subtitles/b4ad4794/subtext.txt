49964 54089 And we're on<br />in four, three,
54172 56089 two, one.
58256 62006 What if I told you that even the<br />worst neighborhood in America
62089 64172 could be made<br />completely safe.
64339 67256 And what if I told you that<br />this could be accomplished
67339 68547 without risking the life
68631 71506 of one single<br />law enforcement officer.
71672 73089 How do I know this?
73172 75381 Because it's happening<br />right now
75464 77756 in every country<br />in the world
77839 79631 but this one.
80214 83672 I'm Pat Novak, and welcome<br />to The Novak Element.
88381 89922 In tonight's<br />State of the Union segment
90006 92047 we'll be joined<br />by General Curtis Monroe
92131 94339 live from the War Room<br />in the Pentagon.
96006 97839 General Monroe,<br />welcome back.
97964 99089 Good to see you, Pat.
99172 103506 Thank you for this unprecedented<br />access to your operations.
103672 107297 Could you walk us through<br />what we're seeing here?
107464 109672 Well, this is<br />a routine operation.
109797 111922 We found that<br />random patrols
112006 115381 <i>helped the local population<br />to feel safer and to trust us.</i>
115464 116464 It's amazing.
116589 118881 And what are<br />these colored dots
118964 120464 that we're seeing here,<br />General?
120631 123547 <i>These are our assets<br />on the ground.</i>
123631 126214 In green,<br />we got the ED-209s.
126297 129006 They're the big boys.<br />They secure the perimeter.
129172 131339 Purple are<br />the smaller EM-208s.
131422 132964 They sweep and mop up.
133131 136006 And the red dots, Pat,<br />that's your film crew.
137756 140214 It is great to see<br />American machines
140297 143589 helping to promote<br />peace and freedom abroad.
143672 145422 All right, you guys, this<br />is a standard op, all right?
145506 146881 There's no<br />opposition expected.
146964 149131 I'm gonna set your markers<br />to code red.
152506 155006 All our drones are gonna<br />give top priority to your safety.
155089 157214 No red assets<br />have ever been lost.
157297 158422 Okay.<br />Okay?
158506 159839 Does that<br />make you feel better?
160131 161839 But, listen,
161922 163672 keep those bracelets on,<br />you're completely safe.
163756 164839 Okay?
164922 166172 Good. Enjoy the show.
172089 174422 All right. Let's go.
179422 181506 May peace<br />be upon you.
182131 185339 Please exit your homes<br />with your arms raised
185422 187922 for a noninvasive<br />scanning procedure.
188006 190006 No one will be harmed.
200172 202589 Please exit your homes<br />with your arms raised
202672 205339 for a noninvasive<br />scanning procedure.
205839 207589 No one will be harmed.
210172 211797 Scott, get me<br />a shot of this.
212506 214547 Your cooperation<br />is appreciated.
214631 217547 We apologize<br />for any inconvenience.
219756 221339 May peace be upon you.
229464 230506 Incredible.
231006 232922 Incredible!
233089 237339 Not long ago, that would have<br />been American men and women
237422 240589 risking their lives<br />to pacify these people.
241672 243881 General, you care<br />to comment on this?
243964 246422 Well, Pat,<br />we had Vietnam,
246506 249297 we had Iraq,<br />we had Afghanistan.
249839 251047 Never again.
251131 254589 From a military perspective,<br />this has been invaluable.
254756 256464 We can accomplish<br />our objectives
256547 258589 without any loss<br />to American lives
258672 262006 and I think the honest people<br />over there really appreciate it.
262381 263922 And why wouldn't they?
264006 266339 For the first time<br />in their lives
266422 268756 they get to watch<br />their children grow up
268839 272714 in an environment<br />of safety and security.
274256 274756 Navid!
274756 276172 Get away from the window!
276506 278339 Mom! They're here! They're coming!
279589 281172 Come here! Come here right now!
281756 282339 Arash!
283589 285381 Navid! You stay with your mom and sisters!
285547 286256 But he's just a kid.
286256 286672 Sayeh!
287214 288672 Stay here with your mom and the kids!
289297 290881 What do you think you're doing?<br />You heard me!
291131 293506 Arash, please don't go! Don't do this!
296589 297756 Navid! My dear! Come back here!
299422 299964 Navid!
300672 301506 Shut the door!
302922 304506 We're not here to kill any of them.
305422 306006 Got it?
306506 309214 The goal is to die on television.
309756 310214 Let's go!
311506 312506 Kelly!
312631 314256 Can you hear me out there?
314422 317256 Loud and clear, Pat.<br />I'm here in sunny Tehran
317339 321589 where locals have clearly<br />embraced these routine scans.
321672 323631 As you can see behind me,<br />they're working
323714 325506 in collaboration<br />with the robots
325589 330089 and obviously their safety<br />IS everyone's top priority.
347964 349506 Don't make a move before I say...
349964 351714 I wanna make sure they're recording.
352297 352672 Yes!
353047 353547 Yes! Yes!
354172 354756 We're ready.
360339 361422 You'll notice children
361506 363547 in the streets as well.<br />This is everyday life
363631 365714 happening in perfect harmony.
370964 372256 Oh, great.<br />Here, come here.
372339 373464 Stay put,<br />stay put, stay put.
373631 375006 It's fine. Don't worry.<br />My guy's got it.
389422 390422 Navid! It's dangerous here!
390506 391256 Come away! Come...
391506 392756 Navid, where are you going?
394297 395714 Look at me! Navid! Navid!
395714 397172 What are you looking for? Navid!
398172 399756 Navid! Navid! What are you...
400214 401214 Navid! Don't go! Navid!
417797 418964 Oh, my God!
425922 427172 Drop your weapon.
432464 433506 Kelly?
433672 435589 Kelly!<br />Are you all right? Kelly!
435756 436839 We're okay, Pat.
436922 439339 <i>Our robots have just repelled<br />some suicide bombers.</i>
439756 441131 I'm sorry, Kelly,
441214 445006 but for security reasons the Pentagon's<br />going to cut our feed to Tehran.
445089 446381 But, please, be careful.
446464 448256 Yeah. I'll continue<br />to stand by.
450672 455256 Now you see how fundamental<br />these robots are to our foreign policy.
455922 457131 So then tell me.
457297 461631 Why can't we use these<br />machines here at home?
461964 466756 Why is America<br />so robophobic?
467672 470672 On the one hand,<br />we have Raymond Sellars.
471589 474756 An entrepreneur<br />and true American
474839 478006 whose product just saved<br />my colleague's life.
478297 480381 And on the other.
480464 482881 Hubert Dreyfus.
482964 487006 A man with both feet<br />planted firmly in the past
487256 491464 whose bill prohibits the<br />use of drones on US soil.
491631 494672 The American people<br />support the Dreyfus Act
494839 498297 because they haven't<br />experienced this technology
498464 501506 and they fear<br />what they don't understand.
502131 505506 We at The Novak Element<br />support Mr. Sellars' efforts
505839 508922 to make our country<br />and our viewers safer.
509089 511006 After all,
511089 515131 what's more important than the<br />safety of the American people?
542339 543964 Hey, Murphy.<br />Hey.
546172 547589 How's Jack?
548006 549464 We don't know yet.
549964 551672 Murphy.
551839 553672 How's it going?<br />Good.
559422 560714 What the hell<br />are they doing here?
560797 563714 Six in the morgue.<br />Lewis in the hospital.
563797 565714 This was the mother<br />of all bad ideas.
565797 567756 We got a lead on<br />Antoine Vallon, we took it.
567839 568839 What lead?
569797 571089 Not in front of them.
571589 573506 This is bullshit. Yeah?
573672 575256 Yeah, you got something<br />to say, Murphy?
575339 576422 Vallon's our case.
576506 580339 Yeah, two years without no arrest, no<br />nothing? You've gotta be dumb or dirty.
581339 583756 You got something on us?<br />Or is this personal?
583964 585839 No, it's nothing personal.
586256 588089 Although, I don't<br />like you as a person.
588339 590172 Okay, you two, out.
590339 591756 No problem.
593172 594589 Maybe if you hadn't<br />gone off the reservation,
594672 596214 your partner would<br />still be standing.
596339 598131 - What'd you say to me?<br />- Hey, that's enough!
601297 602506 Okay, Alex.
605297 607089 It's just you and me now.
607839 610172 So me and Jack, we've<br />been doin' some street buys.
610339 611839 We get a line on some guns.
612589 615506 We meet up with this<br />low-level G called Jerry
615672 618131 who ends up havin' a piece<br />he's not supposed to have.
618297 620089 Where the hell you get<br />a gun like that, Jerry?
620256 622089 I can get you two<br />whole crates full, man.
622256 623256 Two crates?
623422 624422 No disrespect, J,
624506 626339 but how a clown like you<br />get so much product, man?
626506 627672 What's it matter<br />where it comes from?
627839 630422 Why it matters, we don't<br />want no dirty guns, Jerry.
630589 632339 These guns got bodies<br />on' em, Jerry?
632506 633672 Yo, look,<br />they're clean, all right?
633756 635214 You gonna buy<br />this shit or not?
635297 636756 Why you acting<br />SO nervous, man?
636839 638672 You fishin' on us, Jerry?
638756 639839 What'd you say?
639964 641922 You think he fishin', D?<br />I think he's fishin' on us.
642006 643422 Yo, what the hell<br />are they talkin' about, man?
643506 644839 Hey, let me see your phone.
645339 646339 Let me see your phone.
646422 647631 I'm not showing you<br />my phone, man!
647714 648964 You recordin' this?
649256 650714 I think you're<br />a goddamn cop!
650797 651797 What the hell are<br />you talkin' about, man?
651881 653172 I'm not showing you<br />my phone!
653297 654339 Hey! Put your gun down!
654422 655631 Put your phones<br />on the table.
655714 657631 We're not cops, all right?<br />We work for Antoine Vallon.
657839 658839 What?
659006 660797 Shut up! Shut up!<br />What'd you say?
661172 662964 Ends up he works<br />for Vallon.
663131 665922 Before the meet, we ran the<br />serial numbers on the rifles.
666089 668256 The guns were supposed to be<br />in our evidence room.
669506 671006 Not out on the street.
671172 673256 Intake papers blank.<br />No signatures.
673422 675672 What do you got?<br />Nothin'.
676506 678339 How do you think<br />that happened?
680256 682256 I'm telling you, Murphy,<br />this is a mistake.
682422 685339 These guys'll shoot you<br />just to see if they gun work.
685756 686797 We need backup.
686964 689256 If we call for backup, word's<br />gonna get around the station.
689339 690672 He's gonna disappear.
691006 692506 It's gonna be all right.
693339 695589 So we told Vallon<br />we were gun buyers,
695756 696922 and he bought it.
697089 701006 What do you two need with that<br />much product? You plotting a coup?
702006 704339 Man, don't trip, we ain't gonna<br />bust a single shot in your town.
704506 706422 We got some problems<br />back home with Chicago PD.
707839 709547 Yeah, I heard<br />you don't like cops.
710131 711506 Hey, boss.
713006 714506 What do you got for me?
716297 717297 Really?
717506 720172 We were just about to<br />close the deal but someone tipped him off.
720339 722756 Gentlemen,<br />I gotta deal with this.
722922 724339 Two minutes.
731422 732839 Make sure<br />you Kill 'em both!
741797 744589 I got two handguns,<br />one automatic.
757256 759506 We gotta get out of here.<br />I'm gonna take the automatic.
759672 760964 You sure about this?
783297 784297 You ready?
784589 785589 Move.
826089 827256 Lewis!
828172 829297 Lewis!
832172 835839 Officer down!<br />Officer down, 331 Hamilton.
836006 837464 This is Detective Alex Murphy
837547 839464 in need of immediate<br />medical assistance.
839631 841631 331 Hamilton Road.
842631 843672 Jack.
844672 847631 Jack, come on.<br />Jack. Can you hear me?
848172 850131 Jack. Stay with me.
851089 852172 Jack.
852756 856006 Alex, you don't<br />do something like this
856172 857839 unless you bring it<br />to me first.
858006 859339 Vallon's connected.
859506 863297 I'm warning you, don't make<br />any more moves until I vet this.
863464 865172 If officers are<br />supplying him with guns...
865256 867339 That's up to IAD.
867797 869297 I'll handle it.
874964 879631 I don't care how sophisticated<br />these machines are, Mr. Sellars.
879839 884339 A machine does not know<br />what it feels like to be human.
884506 886881 It can't understand<br />the value of human life.
886964 888464 Why should it be<br />allowed to take one?
889672 893047 To legislate<br />over life and death,
893131 896922 we need people who<br />understand right from wrong.
897256 899339 What do your machines feel?
899506 902964 Well, they feel no anger.<br />They feel no prejudice.
903131 907672 They feel no fatigue, which makes<br />them ideal for law enforcement.
908672 911839 Putting these machines<br />on the streets
912006 915006 will save countless<br />American lives.
915172 917006 You're evading<br />the question. No, I'm not.
917172 918214 Yes,<br />you're evading the question.
918297 921756 I asked what do<br />these machines feel?
921922 924756 If one of them<br />killed a child,
925839 927297 what would it feel?
930922 932797 Nothing.<br />And that's the problem.
932964 938256 That's why 72% of Americans will<br />not stand for a robot pulling the trigger.
945089 949214 America is the world's most<br />valuable market, and we can't touch it.
949506 954797 With a domestic expansion,<br />we'd clear $600 billion per annum.
954964 959839 In other words, every second that law is<br />in existence, we are hemorrhaging money.
960006 961006 What do you<br />want me to do?
961172 964506 We've thrown cash at senators at<br />both sides of the aisle. Nobody's budging.
964672 966589 They don't want to vote<br />against their constituents.
966756 969797 So unless we sway public<br />opinion, the battle's lost.
969964 971922 Now, to that effect,
972089 976339 my team have come up with a<br />pretty aggressive new campaign.
976506 979006 Wow factor<br />off-the-charts.
979172 982006 We need to give Americans<br />a product they can love.
982339 984006 A figure<br />they can rally behind.
984172 987172 Sir, I have dissected this<br />bill. There are no loopholes.
987339 989006 We can't put a machine<br />on the streets.
989089 990297 Forget machines.
990464 991839 You saw the polls.
992297 994506 Americans don't<br />want a machine.
995756 997339 They want
997422 1000172 a product<br />with a conscience.
1000797 1002756 They want
1002839 1005714 something that knows
1006756 1009256 what it feels like
1009339 1010797 to be human.
1017339 1019672 We're gonna put a man<br />inside a machine.
1023464 1027297 You're not you because<br />of your legs, your arms, your hands.
1027381 1029047 You're you because<br />of your brain.
1029131 1033547 It's your brain's capacity to process<br />information that makes you who you are.
1034922 1039172 Relax, and just do<br />what you've always done.
1042964 1044797 I've never played<br />with these.
1045006 1049297 The music doesn't come from your<br />fingers, Michael, it comes from your mind.
1049464 1051422 All you have to do<br />is let it out.
1052381 1053506 Please.
1084339 1085797 Oh, my God.
1090131 1091714 No, it's okay. Easy.
1093839 1096464 His emotions are peaking.<br />The readings are getting clouded.
1096797 1097797 It's okay.
1098422 1100797 Relax. If you get<br />too emotional,
1100881 1102756 it'll change the chemistry<br />in your brain,
1102922 1104672 It'll throw the system out.
1107756 1110256 You're doing great.<br />Come on.
1124922 1126839 I need emotion to play.
1127672 1129797 Concierto de<br />Aranjuez, second movement.
1131172 1132672 Beautiful piece.
1132756 1135547 Dennett, when you<br />have a moment. Thank you.
1135797 1138797 Now, we agreed on this<br />a long time ago, Raymond.
1138881 1142589 I wouldn't be asked to<br />develop combat applications.
1142756 1145922 My work here is driven<br />by its own questions.
1146006 1149547 And your work is brilliant. But<br />your ideas are being underutilized.
1149631 1152381 Look, I think<br />I found a way
1152464 1156214 to put real revenue stream<br />behind your research
1156881 1159964 and save thousands<br />of lives in the process.
1172797 1174172 You're not<br />keeping up your end,
1174256 1175589 leaving me exposed<br />like that.
1175756 1177547 Detective Murphy's<br />just a little impulsive.
1177714 1178797 So put him<br />on the payroll.
1178881 1179881 Why are we talkin'<br />about this?
1180047 1181589 It won't work. And now that<br />his partner got hit,
1181672 1183589 he's never gonna let it go.
1183756 1185631 What is that?<br />Lewis' hospital.
1185797 1187089 Alex is dropping by<br />this afternoon,
1187172 1189256 in case you want<br />to send flowers.
1193547 1194672 Yeah.
1194839 1196214 I kill a cop,
1196297 1197964 lookin' over my shoulder<br />the rest of my life.
1198047 1199381 That's not good<br />for business.
1200172 1202464 Who do you think's<br />gonna be investigating you?
1208631 1210964 I'm gonna go hard<br />after Lake and Daniels.
1213172 1215672 I'm gonna have 'em in<br />bracelets within a month, man.
1217506 1219131 Hey, Vallon,<br />I'm walking up right now.
1220297 1221714 Cameras off?
1223089 1224089 Clear.
1225381 1228964 You were right.<br />We should've had backup.
1229131 1230506 I'm sorry.
1234006 1235839 You're not really sleeping,<br />are ya?
1238464 1239589 Asshole.
1241964 1246756 Sergeant Thomas Ryan, NYPD.<br />Paralyzed from the waist down.
1247339 1251214 He has let himself go a<br />little since the accident.
1251381 1252506 Pass.
1252672 1254131 Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.
1254672 1257131 Officer Alfred Miller,<br />Denver.
1257631 1260839 "Severe Cerebellar..."
1260922 1262506 Cerebellar ataxia.
1262756 1264256 That's why you're<br />the doctor, Doctor.
1264839 1268506 He scored through the roof<br />with our urban demos.
1268589 1270172 Let's keep this one<br />in mind. I like this guy.
1270422 1273131 Very good, sir.<br />I saved the best for last.
1274672 1278756 I give you Sergeant Jack<br />Freeman, masculinity incarnate.
1278839 1281214 Led Pittsburgh SWAT<br />for five years,
1281297 1283381 now confined<br />to a wheelchair.
1285797 1287922 I think I can<br />see the appeal.
1288006 1289006 No.
1289089 1290964 What? Why?
1291131 1294047 Well, check the psych<br />evaluation. He's far too unstable.
1294214 1296006 He's trying to say<br />that he has a temper.
1296297 1298672 Have you any idea<br />what we'd be putting him through?
1298839 1302089 The psychological strain requires<br />someone emotionally balanced.
1302256 1304297 We have to be scientific.
1304464 1307172 I mean, we're not selling<br />a soft drink here, are we?
1307339 1310047 He's right. Okay.<br />Keep looking.
1311964 1314881 David, what did I say?<br />Not until you're finished.
1315047 1317047 Hey, guys.<br />Hi, Dad.
1317422 1320006 Hey, little monkey.<br />Hey.
1324256 1325464 How's the game, buddy?
1325631 1328506 Damon got ejected, but we<br />got a two-man advantage.
1328672 1331506 Oh, yeah?<br />That's fantastic.
1331589 1333131 Hey, D, why don't<br />you head upstairs
1333214 1334881 and start getting ready<br />for bed.
1335131 1336714 But he just got home.
1337339 1338797 I'll be up in a second.
1338881 1341339 Tuck you in, okay?<br />All right?
1345172 1347089 Now give your mom a Kiss.<br />Good night, baby.
1347256 1348464 Too slow, boy.
1350506 1352047 You're just too slow.
1359964 1361131 How's Jack holding up?
1361297 1363756 They said a week<br />till he's back on his feet.
1364631 1365589 It's my fault.
1365672 1367047 We shouldn't even<br />have been there.
1369714 1370714 Here.
1434964 1436756 Oh, shit, I thought<br />I fixed that.
1436922 1438214 It'll stop.
1444506 1446256 It's gonna<br />wake up David.
1489964 1494464 He suffered 4th<br />degree burns over 80% of his body.
1495047 1497464 Lower spine<br />has been severed.
1498422 1500339 If he survives,
1501131 1505006 he'll be paralyzed from the waist<br />down and confined to a wheelchair.
1507756 1509464 Mrs. Murphy,
1511214 1513547 we don't have to do this.
1514881 1517922 I need to know everything<br />before I make a decision.
1521214 1522672 Please continue.
1523672 1525797 Vestibulocochlear,
1525881 1528964 optical nerves have<br />been critically damaged.
1530006 1532131 He'll be blind in one eye.
1532756 1534214 Most likely deaf.
1535256 1537422 Frankly, Dr. Norton<br />and the Omni Foundation
1537506 1539006 are the leaders<br />in this field.
1539172 1542756 In my opinion, this is the<br />only chance your husband has.
1542922 1545297 I'd seriously<br />consider their offer.
1548089 1549381 I'm sorry, Doctor.
1550964 1552381 I need time to think.
1552547 1556464 I'm afraid, Mrs. Murphy, time<br />is one thing you don't have.
1560506 1563339 You say you can save him,<br />but what does that mean?
1566589 1568547 What kind of life<br />will he have?
1578172 1580422 Fly me to the moon
1581089 1584797 Let me play<br />among the stars
1585506 1587881 Thanks.<br />Thanks, buddy.
1588047 1589839 You know she's gonna<br />make me dance again.
1589964 1591672 Now that I've gotta see.
1591839 1592839 You don't want<br />to see that.
1592922 1594589 Here she comes now.
1594756 1595881 Hold on to that.
1595964 1597214 Get out there, partner.
1598756 1600506 Every time.
1604339 1605422 Get her, boy.
1610464 1612964 Fill my heart with song
1613047 1617381 And let me sing forever more
1618422 1621631 You are all I long for
1621714 1623797 All I worship...
1623881 1625839 Subject is<br />still dreaming.
1627172 1628756 He's retrieving memories,
1628839 1632256 trying to make sense of<br />sensorial stimulation package 37.
1633256 1634797 Perfect, Kim.
1636297 1638297 Let's reconnect the spine.
1639297 1640797 Time to wake him up.
1644464 1647422 Fill my heart with song
1647506 1651089 Let me sing forever more
1652422 1655589 You are all I long for
1655672 1660006 All I worship and adore
1660589 1662672 In other words
1663172 1667172 Please be true
1667256 1668797 Excuse me?
1669422 1671006 What are you doing here?
1671297 1672756 Baby, where you going?
1672839 1676131 In other words
1676214 1677339 Lewis.
1677589 1681297 I love
1684964 1686297 You
1688006 1691214 Subject regaining<br />cognitive functions.
1693089 1694381 What's happening?
1696797 1697797 Where am I?
1697964 1702464 You were in an explosion,<br />Alex. You're in a hospital.
1704881 1707381 Where's Clara? My wife.<br />Where's my wife?
1707547 1709881 I want you to calm down,<br />Alex. Listen to me.
1710047 1713631 You're okay. And your family's<br />fine. Both your wife and your son.
1714506 1715922 Who the hell are you?
1716339 1719089 I'm Dr. Dennett Norton.<br />I'm treating you.
1719672 1720839 Heart rate rising.
1723589 1724964 I can't move.
1727547 1730131 I can't move.<br />What the hell is all that?
1730297 1731422 Visual input unstable.
1731589 1733006 I want you to relax, Alex.
1733089 1734464 Subject's dumping<br />too much epinephrine.
1734547 1735922 Should we purge it?<br />Not yet.
1736547 1738547 Unlock vertebrae.
1743547 1744881 Go ahead, Kim.
1745464 1748464 Unlock upper,<br />lower extremities.
1761131 1763214 What kind of suit is this?
1763381 1766881 It's not a suit, Alex.
1769006 1770256 It's you.
1772172 1773839 This was the only option.
1774006 1777506 We're here, all of us,<br />to make you whole again.
1778131 1779464 Full body unlock.
1779547 1781922 I want you<br />to walk now, Alex.
1782006 1783589 You can do that.
1807339 1809089 This seems so real.
1812006 1813881 Alex,<br />it's very important
1813964 1815547 you understand<br />what is happening.
1815714 1817006 This is real.
1817089 1820256 It's not a dream, it's<br />not drugs or anesthetics.
1820422 1823256 I know I'm dreaming<br />'cause I can feel all of this.
1823339 1826381 Alex, amputees can often<br />feel their missing appendages.
1826547 1827756 It's called<br />phantom limb sensation.
1827839 1829089 What do you mean "amputees"?
1829547 1831422 What the hell did you do<br />to me? You need to relax.
1831589 1832881 Take this off me now.
1833047 1835506 I need to get out of this<br />thing. What did you do to me?
1835881 1837631 What have you done to me?
1838256 1840131 Alex? Hey!
1841506 1842506 Shut him down.
1842672 1845214 No! Let him run!<br />Let him run!
1865839 1867047 Where am I?
1891589 1893089 Alex, please.
1894756 1895922 Stop.
1896881 1898672 Alex, you have to stop.
1900131 1901339 Please.
1902464 1903589 Alex.
1905131 1906589 Please stop.
1907089 1908589 Stay where you are
1908672 1911506 and we'll come<br />and pick you up.
1945047 1946464 Okay, Kim.
1947756 1949089 Shut him down.
1975006 1976506 Alex,
1977214 1979047 you can't run from this.
1981047 1985214 You have to understand<br />the reality of the situation.
1988839 1990047 Show me.
1992214 1993422 Kim.
2009464 2010631 Oh!
2013047 2014089 No.
2018339 2019839 Holy Christ.
2020839 2022214 Holy Christ.
2024339 2026672 Holy Christ,<br />there's nothing left.
2032797 2036464 Your body may have gone,<br />but you're still here.
2042922 2044631 That's not even my brain.
2044797 2047922 We had to repair<br />the damaged areas.
2048089 2051214 But we didn't interfere with<br />your emotion or your intellect.
2051631 2053839 Do you understand me, Alex?
2054547 2057297 You're in control.
2058131 2060547 I'm in control?<br />Yes.
2063297 2064589 Okay.
2067756 2070089 If I'm in control,
2071464 2073214 then I wanna die.
2074714 2079964 Just unplug whatever it is keepin'<br />me alive and end this nightmare.
2080506 2082339 Now, say I did that.
2082506 2085047 Which as a doctor would<br />almost be impossible for me,
2085131 2087131 but say I did.
2089006 2091256 What do I say<br />to your wife?
2091839 2093464 What does she say<br />to your son?
2093631 2096297 That it didn't work.<br />That you tried.
2097297 2099006 Somethin' went wrong.
2099881 2102881 You did everything<br />you could,
2105672 2107172 but I died.
2107339 2109172 So after all<br />they've been through,
2109256 2112589 all the pain,<br />all their hope restored,
2112881 2114881 we would just<br />rip that away?
2116464 2118464 Your wife<br />loves you, Alex.
2118839 2120714 She signed<br />the consent forms herself.
2120797 2124131 Otherwise, you couldn't have<br />undergone the procedure.
2134297 2138922 She loves you and she<br />gave you a second chance.
2141172 2143714 I need you to take it.
2148089 2150672 I don't wanna see myself<br />like this again.
2152256 2153297 Ever.
2153464 2155631 And the same goes<br />for my family.
2163297 2165089 Just put me back in.
2169631 2170714 Zoom in.
2173131 2174297 Stop.
2177214 2178381 Zoom in.
2180714 2182089 Stop.
2187172 2188881 Accept the connection.
2194214 2196422 It's so good<br />to finally see you.
2196589 2198922 I was gonna say<br />the same thing.
2200089 2201547 I'm sorry.
2202506 2204881 I know how I must<br />look to you.
2205047 2207381 I think you look beautiful.
2211256 2213172 Are they treating you okay,<br />baby?
2213339 2217756 So far. Dr. Norton,<br />he seems like a nice guy.
2219214 2221256 Does David know<br />you're calling?
2224714 2226297 He misses you.
2227047 2229172 I can go get him.<br />No.
2230506 2232714 I don't want him<br />to see me like this.
2234881 2235964 Not yet.
2236256 2237339 Sure.
2243214 2245714 We're gonna<br />get through this, baby.
2248422 2250797 We're gonna make it<br />like it was.
2255339 2256839 When are you comin' home?
2257006 2259339 Well, they've still<br />got some tests.
2260422 2262547 But they're sayin'<br />it's goin' really well.
2264464 2265964 The minute they let me.
2268381 2269922 I gotta go.
2271047 2272339 I love you.
2272506 2274131 End the connection.
2288506 2292339 Okay,<br />blood cleansing initiated.
2294131 2297714 Viral and bacterial<br />screening activated.
2299964 2303381 Releasing proteins, fats,
2303547 2306339 minerals and carbs.
2308547 2313547 Energy inflow<br />is at 1320 kilocalories.
2315131 2319297 Now starting anti-inflammatory<br />corticoids, hormones
2319464 2322381 and antibiotic protocols.
2322922 2325006 Standard daily intake.
2327464 2329547 Release antidepressants.
2330714 2333047 Let's give him a nice dream.
2344172 2345672 All right, here's<br />what you're dealin' with.
2345922 2348464 Modified M2 battle rifle.
2348631 2351006 .50 caliber Beowulf<br />ammunition at 30 round clips.
2351131 2352922 Three-shot bursts<br />or full auto.
2354256 2355297 Heavy-duty.
2356631 2359756 TSR 66. Cartridge-driven<br />taser pistol.
2359922 2364256 Each projectile releases up to<br />200,000 volts. It can stun, it can Kill
2364422 2365797 and it's nasty shit.
2366172 2367214 Your armor,
2367297 2368631 state-of-the-art,<br />but not invulnerable.
2368797 2371339 .50 caliber or larger<br />can penetrate and Kill.
2371506 2375214 Multiple hits, and guess who<br />ends up in the recycling bin?
2377547 2379422 If you sense you need a<br />weapon or are threatened
2381422 2384547 the visor goes down and the<br />system makes the weapons available.
2384714 2387589 But you gotta remember, it's<br />not the weapons that count.
2387672 2388714 It's who's handling them.
2388797 2391006 Or, in your case, what.
2391422 2393922 You think you can do this?<br />Oh, just stick to your job.
2394047 2396881 Just stick to my job?<br />Combat robots are my job, Doc.
2397047 2401131 Rio, Congo, you name it, I was<br />there. Our machines run perfectly.
2401297 2403339 You ask me, stickin'<br />organics into the system
2403422 2405506 is a huge step backwards.
2405964 2407881 I don't care how well<br />you designed this thing.
2408047 2410339 Without my sign-off, it<br />better start learnin' Chinese,
2410422 2411881 'cause it ain't<br />never goin' home.
2419422 2421297 It's nice to meet you, too.
2422714 2424297 Let's do this,
2424631 2425922 Tin Man.
2432256 2436256 Quality control,<br />EM-208 versus Tin Man.
2436422 2439339 Rendering scenario one now.
2440172 2441797 Hey, Doc,<br />hope you don't mind.
2441881 2443006 I like a little music<br />while I'm workin'.
2444422 2447047 When a man's an empty kettle
2447214 2452172 All right. All right, let's let the<br />games begin. Let's rock 'n' roll.
2454089 2455339 Commence scenario.
2455506 2458506 Just because I'm presumin'<br />That I could be kind of human
2458672 2461881 If I only had a heart
2463006 2467922 I'd be tender, I'd be gentle<br />And awful sentimental
2468089 2470547 Regarding love and art
2471922 2474381 I'd be friends<br />with the sparrows
2474464 2476547 And the boy<br />who shoots the arrows
2476714 2479589 If I only had a heart
2481506 2485172 Picture me a balcony
2486214 2489172 Above a voice sings low...
2489381 2491131 Laggin' on<br />the corners.
2491214 2492714 No, there,<br />do you see that?
2492797 2494672 What my robot did,<br />that's how you do it.
2497006 2498214 New product's afraid.
2499089 2502422 2.3 seconds behind. Great.
2504006 2505297 Don't shoot! He has a gun!
2505381 2506422 Drop your gun!
2508881 2509881 Drop your gun!
2510839 2512339 Drop the weapon.<br />Let the kid go!
2512506 2515672 Oh, well, it's worried that<br />the kid's gonna get hurt.
2515839 2517339 - Let the kid go!<br />- Too bad.
2518881 2522839 Well, there you have it. 5.6<br />seconds behind. Scenario failure.
2523006 2524881 I wouldn't buy that<br />for a dollar.
2530339 2532756 Let's do it again.<br />Your funeral.
2536547 2537631 Detective Alex Murphy.
2537797 2539006 Search results.
2539089 2541131 "Detective Murphy<br />making a speedy recovery."
2541297 2543422 "Alex Murphy.<br />Man or Machine?”
2543589 2546964 "Thrust into the spotlight,<br />Clara Murphy won't talk."”
2548006 2549589 Antoine Vallon.
2549672 2550756 Search results.
2550839 2554964 "DPD says Antoine Vallon no longer<br />suspect due to lack of evidence.”
2558506 2560381 Detroit Free Press.
2560547 2563631 Unfortunately, Murphy's<br />investigation into Antoine Vallon
2563714 2565131 wasn't authorized<br />in the first place.
2565214 2568922 Look, Detective Murphy was<br />simply overzealous, okay?
2569006 2572131 We have absolutely no evidence<br />linking Vallon to the attempt on his life.
2572214 2574506 All I'm gonna say is<br />my partner's a great cop.
2574589 2578089 And I won't rest until the men who<br />tried to kill him are brought to justice.
2581964 2582964 What's wrong with him?
2583047 2584131 No, nothing, nothing.
2585297 2588714 Watch the procedural bars<br />on the 208.
2589589 2593089 The machine assesses<br />the threat and acts.
2593714 2595089 That's it.
2595589 2597964 It's two steps.<br />Now watch Alex.
2599006 2603089 The software assesses<br />the threat, just like the robot.
2603256 2605131 And it sends the information<br />to the brain.
2605297 2608047 Alex's brain receives the information<br />and decides what to do with it
2608131 2612756 based on his emotional cognitive<br />abilities like any man would.
2612922 2616089 Then the brain relates this<br />to the Al module and...
2616256 2618964 Yeah, like, you know,<br />a year later.
2619047 2620256 And our computers<br />finish the job.
2620381 2624089 Raymond, you wanted<br />a man inside a machine.
2624172 2625756 And that's what you've got.
2625839 2627964 But the human element<br />will always be present.
2628047 2630631 Fear, instinct,<br />bias, compassion,
2630714 2631964 they will always interfere<br />with the system!
2632047 2633589 Okay, but, Dennett,
2633672 2637089 I've gotta give the American<br />people something they can root for.
2637172 2638922 Something aspirational, right?
2639006 2640422 They have to<br />believe in this thing.
2640589 2644006 "Pretty good"? I don't<br />know how to sell "okay."
2644089 2645714 We, you and I,<br />have got a release date,
2645797 2647214 and we've gotta<br />make it, okay?
2647297 2649881 So I don't care how you do it. I'm<br />askin' ya, come on, can you help me?
2649964 2653422 Just get him to do that.<br />Get him to do that.
2653506 2654922 That is a machine.
2655006 2656464 I know, but it's a man<br />inside a machine.
2656547 2659422 No, that's a man<br />inside a machine right there!
2659506 2660589 And his life depends on it.
2660672 2662047 And the future of Omnicorp<br />depends on it
2662131 2664964 so get your ass back to China<br />and get it fixed.
2665047 2667214 I don't care how you do it,<br />just go do it!
2682672 2685756 It tastes like<br />peanut butter.
2689714 2691881 I can't get it<br />out of my mouth.
2692589 2694339 And you<br />don't like peanut butter?
2694506 2695714 No.
2696464 2698047 You like peanut butter, Kim?
2698214 2699631 I love it.
2701339 2702756 Okay.
2703797 2705381 I'm gonna put you<br />to sleep now, Alex.
2705464 2706547 Okay.
2707797 2709797 Now, put him under, Kim.
2715172 2716881 What are you planning to do?
2717839 2721756 Consciousness<br />is nothing more
2721922 2724631 than the processing<br />of information.
2726172 2728006 I'm gonna fix him.
2729422 2731506 And he won't<br />know the difference.
2742839 2744422 Raymond?<br />Yeah?
2744506 2747964 We just ran focus groups<br />at Ryan Correctional Facility.
2748839 2751922 We call this Combat Mode.
2752089 2754797 It really put the fear of God<br />into the prisoners.
2754964 2756089 Yeah, that's okay.
2756256 2758006 And get a load of this.
2758756 2762589 What's that? He<br />transforms. Kids love it.
2762922 2765256 Really? Focus group<br />numbers through the roof.
2765422 2766756 Really?<br />Oh, yeah.
2766922 2768881 Well, that's really<br />embarrassing.
2769047 2771006 What is this?<br />You know what?
2771172 2773006 People really don't know<br />what they want
2773089 2775297 until you show it to 'em<br />most of the time.
2776131 2778381 Make him more, uh,
2778464 2779464 tactical.
2779547 2781089 Make him look, uh...
2783256 2785006 Let's go with black.
2786297 2787506 Yeah.
2822631 2823631 Alex.
2823797 2825881 He looks<br />like a billion dollars.
2826047 2828006 2.6 billion.
2828464 2830172 Raymond Sellars.
2830506 2832381 I've looked forward to<br />meeting you, Detective.
2832464 2834547 I really appreciate<br />everything you've done for me.
2834631 2836839 Well, we funded<br />this program
2836922 2839131 to give men like you<br />a second chance.
2839964 2841756 You just do<br />your best today.
2842131 2843381 Shall we?<br />Let's.
2846506 2848964 Mr. Sellars, we're ready<br />for you. Okay, great.
2849131 2850589 Chief Technician Shuman.
2850756 2852131 Mornin', folks.
2855256 2857464 Okay, so this is how it's gonna be.
2857631 2859922 We're goin' toe-to-toe.<br />Last man standing wins.
2860422 2862631 I hit you, you go back<br />to the drawing board.
2862714 2865214 You hit me,<br />you get a ticket back home.
2866381 2869047 My guys are gonna be<br />shootin' .47 caliber rounds.
2869214 2871381 Do a little damage,<br />but they can't take you out.
2871547 2874881 But make no mistake,<br />Tin Man, my gun will.
2890297 2891464 Alex, listen to me.
2892006 2894256 The EM-208s will<br />try to maneuver you
2894339 2895672 so Mattox can<br />get a clear shot.
2896381 2898881 Do not let that happen.
2899006 2902339 If Mattox hits you, everything<br />but your life support will shut down.
2902422 2905547 You'll feel more pain than<br />you've ever felt in your life.
2905881 2908547 I don't know about that.<br />I've been through a lot.
2914589 2915797 All right.
2916631 2918506 I say we go on three.
2918672 2919672 Three.
2941631 2943214 How's it going down there?
2945339 2948339 Whatever you do,<br />don't get shot in the face.
2951839 2952839 Wow.
2985006 2987797 Dr. Norton,<br />how is he doing this?
2988589 2992089 His software is<br />faster. His hardware is stronger.
2992256 2993756 He's a better machine.
2996381 2998589 But you said<br />humans hesitate.
2998756 3001047 Only when they're<br />making decisions.
3001131 3003089 He's not<br />making decisions?
3003256 3005006 Yes and no.
3005381 3008297 In his everyday life,<br />man rules over the machine.
3008381 3010422 Alex makes his own decisions.
3010797 3012631 Now, when he<br />engages in battle,
3012714 3015922 the visor comes down<br />and the software takes over.
3016089 3018047 Then the machine<br />does everything.
3018131 3021464 Alex is a passenger,<br />just along for the ride.
3025006 3026381 But if the machine<br />is in control,
3026464 3027881 then how is Murphy<br />accountable?
3028089 3029089 Who's pulling the trigger?
3029172 3030547 Well, when<br />the machine fights,
3030631 3033131 the system releases signals<br />into Alex's brain
3033214 3035797 making him think he's doing what<br />our computers are actually doing.
3035881 3038714 I mean, Alex believes<br />right now he is in control.
3038797 3042256 But he's not. It's the<br />illusion of free will.
3051964 3053047 Crap!
3075381 3078297 So you've circumvented the law by<br />creating a machine that thinks it's a man.
3078381 3079381 But that's illegal.
3079547 3081339 No. No, no, no.
3082464 3084839 It's a machine that thinks<br />it's Alex Murphy.
3085006 3086297 And in my book
3086797 3088256 that's legal.
3090214 3091381 Well done.
3092922 3094422 Well done.
3097797 3102256 Hey, Doctor, what happens if I tase an<br />exoskeleton with a little asshole inside?
3103339 3106631 [, uh, I think we're<br />all curious to find out.
3106797 3108131 Go ahead.
3145172 3147506 If I had a pulse,<br />it'd be racing.
3148172 3150339 She's been waiting<br />four months.
3150756 3152672 I'm sure hers is, too.
3155089 3156839 You're gonna do fine.
3166506 3168464 I love your sign, D.
3171797 3172922 Hey.
3177297 3179006 There's nothin' to be<br />nervous about.
3183756 3184922 Thank you, Dennett.
3185797 3187422 It's been a privilege.
3282131 3283172 Hi, Dad.
3286131 3287839 You know<br />I missed you, buddy.
3288839 3290172 Me, too.
3297339 3298797 Wanna feel it?
3302672 3303964 What is it?
3305339 3306839 It's okay, sweetie.
3318297 3321089 I saved all the Red Wings<br />games on my computer.
3322131 3323506 You did?
3326506 3328464 How'd they do?<br />I don't know.
3328631 3330839 I've been waiting<br />to watch them with you.
3332256 3334089 You know I'd love to, kiddo.
3334922 3336506 But I can't tonight.
3337172 3339506 You know, 'cause<br />Daddy's suit needs some...
3340672 3342464 Some special handling.
3344089 3345506 Do you understand?
3376881 3378089 Thanks for coming, Jack.
3378339 3379839 I heard you<br />went home already.
3379922 3381672 I know Clara must be<br />thrilled to have you back.
3381756 3384006 I saw Clara
3384089 3385339 and David.
3388131 3390339 That ain't my home right now.
3391672 3393756 It's in a damn lab<br />across the hall.
3393922 3395631 I'm sorry, Alex.
3396006 3399839 Startin' tomorrow, I'm gonna take<br />down Vallon and his whole damn crew.
3399922 3401797 I was waitin'<br />to hear you say that.
3406006 3408089 Least I know<br />you're the right color now.
3440839 3443131 Pat, the cooler<br />temperatures here today
3443214 3445381 certainly have not stopped<br />people from showing up.
3445464 3447922 We're expecting people<br />from every corner of the city
3448006 3449256 here in Detroit
3449339 3451214 to come out and<br />show their support
3451297 3452547 for Detective Alex Murphy.
3452631 3456172 <i>You know, a lot of questions on people's<br />minds today is what will he look like.</i>
3456464 3458089 Is he a changed man?
3458256 3459922 Rumor has it<br />he is in the building
3460006 3461506 preparing to come out...
3462297 3467631 Alex, we're gonna upload the<br />entire DPD database into your brain.
3468339 3472589 That means you'll have<br />instantaneous access to criminal records
3472672 3476839 plus an archive of CCTV<br />footage from 2011 to the present.
3477006 3478006 All right.
3478964 3480131 Hit me.
3480756 3483006 Okay. Kim,<br />it's all yours.
3484672 3487256 Archive footage<br />uploading successfully.
3487422 3490006 Your system draws<br />connections automatically.
3490089 3491922 It will link perpetrators<br />to their crimes
3492006 3495339 and give you their exact<br />locations whenever available.
3495964 3499172 I got evidence<br />to make 138... No, no.
3499506 3501672 166 arrests.
3502422 3504381 His emotions are stable.
3506006 3507589 This is incredible.
3508131 3510756 You will notice his family<br />is here in the building as well.
3510839 3512922 The mayor is standing<br />onstage behind me.
3513006 3515172 Also, Raymond Sellars<br />from Omnicorp.
3515256 3516506 They seem like great friends
3516589 3519506 obviously echoing the partnership<br />that they've brought together.
3520756 3522089 How much longer<br />will this take?
3522172 3525256 Well, the feed from the<br />database is almost done, so.
3525422 3527006 We're approaching<br />present day.
3527089 3530589 634 pending arrests.
3530672 3533089 We're gonna need<br />a bigger prison.
3535506 3536672 He's on top of her.
3536756 3538589 Dr. Norton,<br />he's getting too emotional.
3538672 3540256 I gotta do something!<br />Alex.
3540339 3542506 Alex, calm down.
3543006 3544422 Take a breath.
3544672 3546089 Relax.
3546339 3547589 Kim, what are the readings?
3547672 3549464 I haven't seen him<br />at levels like this.
3549631 3550714 - He's gonna shoot "em!<br />- Alex!
3550964 3553214 Alex, Alex, relax.
3554172 3555172 Relax.
3556172 3557172 Alex?
3557839 3559839 What is this? LIZ:<br />This just a computer glitch?
3560006 3561756 No. That's<br />his own crime scene.
3561839 3562839 Alex!
3562922 3563922 He's spiking<br />all over the place.
3564006 3565172 Alex!
3565839 3567589 Alex? KIM: The system<br />is crashing, Doctor.
3567756 3568839 Alex, can you hear me?
3569422 3570422 Alex! Alex!
3570589 3572756 I'm not sure he can<br />handle this. I gotta do something!
3572839 3573839 He's emotionally overloaded.
3574089 3575089 Unlock me!
3575256 3576672 Alex! Stop!
3577172 3578797 Stop! He's having a seizure!
3578964 3580839 Kim, shut him down! Alex!
3581172 3582172 Get me a live feed!
3582256 3583422 I can't do it.<br />Dr. Norton's with the patient.
3583506 3584506 Do it now!
3584672 3585797 Jesus Christ!
3585964 3587589 Dr. Norton! Dr. Norton!
3587756 3589131 What?<br />The press is waiting!
3589297 3590297 We have to<br />get him up there now!
3590381 3591506 What do you<br />want me to do?
3591589 3594464 I don't know! Fix him!<br />Do what you have to do!
3594547 3597881 Your reputation is on the<br />line every bit as much as ours.
3598214 3600839 We're running out of time.
3601839 3602922 Okay.
3604339 3605756 Everybody out!
3607339 3608339 Out!
3608422 3609922 Mayor Durant is<br />about to take to the stage
3610006 3613589 and introduce Detroit's newest<br />weapon in the war on crime.
3613672 3616922 I'm actually getting word that<br />he's ready to go right now.
3621464 3623714 Heart rate rising. He<br />might start spiking, Doctor.
3623797 3626422 Set modules to<br />absorb dopamine and nor adrenaline.
3626506 3627672 But you'll be<br />taking away his emotions.
3627756 3629506 Drop the levels<br />until I tell you to stop.
3629589 3631589 Doctor, you'll be taking away<br />his ability to feel anything.
3631672 3633297 Now, please!
3638672 3641172 Pull the footage.<br />Put it on a loop.
3643506 3645006 Dopamine level's at 20%.
3645172 3646172 More.
3648756 3649922 Dopamine<br />level's at 10%.
3650006 3651131 More.
3652172 3653964 Dopamine level's at 5%.<br />Lower.
3654131 3656006 You're flattening him out.<br />Lower!
3658672 3660672 2%.<br />Hold it there.
3667756 3669006 Alex?
3670339 3672339 Alex, how do you feel?
3676339 3678422 I feel fine, Dr. Norton.
3680131 3684506 Well, today I'm not here to<br />talk about crime prevention.
3685006 3688297 I am here<br />to give you the cure.
3688506 3689506 That's right!
3697172 3698297 Hi, Dad!
3700672 3701756 Dad?
3707797 3711422 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />the revolution begins right now
3711589 3714506 with Detective Alex Murphy!
3731547 3732547 Detective.
3747506 3749839 - What's he doing?<br />- He looks like a zombie.
3750506 3752839 I think he's<br />accessing criminal data.
3759839 3761464 Thomas King!<br />You are under arrest!
3779506 3783214 Until today, Thomas King<br />was a convicted felon
3783297 3786839 wanted for rape, arson,<br />and murder.
3787131 3791006 This man has torn<br />apart American families.
3791422 3794714 On the loose for six years.
3795922 3801006 And where was this<br />criminal mastermind hiding?
3804172 3809131 Right in front of<br />the police headquarters.
3809297 3813839 Here he is, just steps away<br />from two of Detroit's finest.
3814006 3817922 These two officers<br />are completely unaware
3818006 3821006 of the monster<br />in their midst.
3823297 3825881 And then, in 60 seconds...
3826006 3829964 I repeat, just 60 seconds,
3830131 3833631 Detective Murphy<br />brings him down.
3833714 3837589 If you cannot afford an attorney,<br />one will be provided for you.
3838422 3843547 This, my friends, is the<br />future of American justice.
3844172 3847381 How many like Thomas King<br />will pay for their crimes
3847464 3850631 now that RoboCop is here?
3851464 3852589 Yes,
3852672 3857172 let's not shy away<br />from what this means, people.
3857672 3861589 Men weren't up to the task.
3861756 3863214 But Alex Murphy,
3863589 3865547 a robot cop,
3865631 3866672 was.
3867964 3869256 We can't take him<br />off the street.
3869339 3870881 This is what I'm saying.<br />He's a hit.
3870964 3872672 A big, fat, stinking hit.
3872756 3875006 Yeah, until he breaks down<br />in front of everyone.
3875089 3878297 Hey, we all knew there<br />would be issues. It's inevitable.
3878464 3881047 Dennett, you're my guy. I just<br />need you to get a handle on this.
3881131 3882256 I know,<br />but I need more time.
3882339 3884839 Scientifically,<br />we're in uncharted water.
3884922 3887089 We need to take him back<br />to the lab and do more tests.
3887172 3890589 I mean, it was like something<br />was interfering with our system.
3890672 3893089 Something beyond<br />chemistry or physics.
3893256 3895089 Like what? His soul?
3895172 3897672 Hey, look, this train has<br />already left the station.
3897756 3900047 I can't exactly go out<br />to the world and say,
3900131 3902631 "Sorry, I released<br />a defective product.”
3902797 3905672 So, no matter what we do, we<br />just need to keep him on the streets.
3905839 3907422 What about the interviews?
3907506 3909922 Cancel 'em.<br />Cancel all of 'em.
3910089 3911422 Everything.
3912131 3913839 In fact, Dennett.
3916297 3919172 <i>Let's keep the wife at a<br />distance for now, as well.</i>
3920339 3921506 I'd like to see him.
3922464 3923797 Can you arrange that?
3923964 3925797 Look, I won't lie to you.
3926339 3929756 Alex was so nervous,<br />we had to sedate him.
3929922 3932589 I looked in his eyes and<br />I couldn't see my husband.
3932672 3936631 And then he just shoots a man in<br />front of our son. That's not sedation.
3937797 3940964 He's responding<br />to drugs differently now.
3942964 3945297 We both knew from day one,
3945964 3948464 there would be complications.
3952756 3954797 Just give me<br />a little more time.
3955756 3957339 I promise,
3958464 3960464 you'll have your husband back.
3962672 3966464 This goes for every<br />squad in every department.
3966631 3970089 Detective Murphy will have<br />full access to all investigations.
3970256 3972797 Robberies,<br />narcotics, homicides.
3972964 3975422 If he requests<br />to take over a case,
3975506 3977089 the case will be<br />handed to him.
3977256 3979006 No arguments,<br />no complaints.
3979172 3980172 This is bullshit!
3980339 3984131 I said no complaints!<br />And I mean it. Now...
3984964 3987839 Good morning, Chief Dean.<br />Good morning, officers.
3988006 3991131 I've selected 13 targets for<br />today, all wanted for murder.
3991506 3993172 John Biggs<br />is target number one.
3993339 3994672 I'll be<br />taking over this case.
3994839 3996589 <i>Ambulances, detention<br />vehicles, and coroners</i>
3996672 3999256 should be ready to<br />move in on my request.
3999422 4001464 I wish you all<br />a very good day.
4008797 4010006 Murphy.
4010672 4012089 You okay, man?
4013964 4015631 I'm fine, Sergeant.
4016172 4017964 Can't wait to<br />get back to work.
4018131 4019922 Lake and Daniels are in there<br />shittin' their pants...
4020006 4021672 Excuse me,<br />I have casework.
4074506 4076172 Don't shoot!<br />Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
4082506 4084464 Walter Karrel,<br />look at me.
4084631 4085922 You have two options.
4086089 4087089 Option one.
4088131 4090006 I shoot you with 50,000 volts
4090172 4093506 which may cause respiratory<br />failure, organ malfunction,
4093589 4096006 internal burns, and loss of<br />bowel and bladder control.
4096089 4097881 And then I arrest you.
4097964 4099506 Option two.<br />You tell me where
4099589 4101922 John Biggs' drug<br />lab is located.
4102006 4104089 And then I arrest you.
4104839 4107131 You have<br />two seconds to decide.
4175839 4177089 Totally justifiable.
4177256 4179506 We are going to make<br />a lot of money.
4179672 4183339 Nothing. No fear.<br />No increase in heart rate.
4183506 4186839 No traces of anger<br />whatsoever.
4187089 4189422 Congratulations, Doctor.
4189756 4191089 You did it.
4192339 4193839 Yes, I did.
4202172 4203464 I told you, sir.
4203631 4206422 Norton clearly never<br />had control of the product.
4206589 4209506 I agree. And<br />that's why I called you here.
4209797 4212506 I just want a second pair of<br />eyes on this thing, that's all.
4212672 4213672 Okay.
4213839 4215714 I'll need a feed<br />from the Tin Man's head
4215839 4217922 plus full surveillance of the<br />lab, and...
4218089 4220506 You're gonna have<br />full access to everything.
4220672 4222506 If anything comes up,
4222589 4224297 I'm gonna be in Washington.
4228339 4229631 He brought peace
4229797 4232256 to this country's<br />most violent city.
4232506 4233506 He showed us all
4233672 4236672 that Detroit and America<br />can have a brighter future.
4237297 4240672 A future of economic growth,<br />freedom, and happiness.
4241006 4245006 On tonight's show,<br />a visionary and true patriot.
4245172 4248756 The CEO of Omnicorp,<br />Raymond Sellars.
4251172 4252172 Hello, Pat.<br />Raymond.
4252256 4253256 Thanks for havin' me.
4253422 4255922 You must be doing<br />a victory lap about now.
4256006 4257006 Well.
4257089 4261006 Two weeks ago, Omni's<br />stock went through the roof.
4261131 4263422 And the Senate<br />has finally agreed
4263506 4265464 to vote on the repeal<br />of the Dreyfus Act.
4265631 4269006 Well, look, I mean, the<br />tide is definitely turning.
4269172 4272006 I just feel certain that soon we'll<br />be keeping all Americans safe.
4272089 4273089 I certainly hope so.
4273464 4276422 But, I think our next guest will<br />have a different point of view.
4276506 4277506 Mmm-hmm.
4277839 4278964 Hubert Dreyfus.
4279506 4281339 Senator,<br />thank you for joining us.
4281506 4283214 Hello, Pat.<br />Mr. Sellars.
4283297 4285589 Senator, do you know<br />what this is?
4285756 4288506 The American public<br />is divided
4288631 4290006 on the Dreyfus Act.
4290172 4295297 Our polls at Novakelement.com<br />are tight at 50-50.
4295506 4299256 There is no doubt<br />Omnicorp created a sensation
4299339 4302756 but this bill is<br />not about Alex Murphy.
4302922 4305881 It's about whether America's<br />willing to give robots
4305964 4307589 the authority<br />over human lives.
4307672 4309256 No. Look, look, look.
4309506 4312006 This sea change<br />we're witnessing,
4312089 4313506 and it is a sea change,
4313589 4315256 shows that Americans<br />don't really care
4315339 4318089 if our law enforcement systems<br />are manned or unmanned.
4318172 4321214 What they care about is efficiency<br />and they care about safety.
4321297 4322547 You're clouding the issue.
4322631 4324172 This is clearly an attempt
4324256 4326672 to sway public opinion<br />with a marketing stunt.
4326839 4328172 What's clear is
4328339 4331797 that with just one system in<br />place, we've cut crime by 80%.
4331881 4333922 Just imagine if we put,
4334006 4336214 I dunno, let's say<br />100 systems in place.
4336464 4338339 And then,<br />I want you to ask yourself,
4338422 4340214 why are you holding us back?
4340297 4341631 Is that your plan?<br />Thank you, Senator.
4341797 4343422 And thank you, Raymond.<br />Thank you, Pat.
4343839 4346506 Well, there you have it.
4347172 4349089 Who could argue with that?
4349172 4351131 Which begs the question.
4351922 4356381 Has the US Senate<br />become pro-crime?
4366047 4367214 Yeah, hi.
4367381 4369006 No, no, 5000.
4369506 4370839 Call me tomorrow.
4372256 4375506 Hey, guys. Vallon's<br />waitin' for you inside.
4377006 4378381 What, you too busy<br />to walk us in?
4378464 4379922 I'm out here makin' money.
4380172 4382922 Where are my trip<br />wires? I gotta do this myself?
4383339 4385672 What took you so long? DANIELS:<br />What the hell is all this shit?
4385839 4387089 I can't move any product
4387172 4388672 with this thing<br />on the streets.
4389381 4390881 What are you doing<br />to protect me?
4391047 4393006 Relax. The guy's<br />a walkin' zombie.
4393172 4394672 And tell me<br />your phones are off.
4394839 4397006 He's not going after you.<br />We covered our tracks.
4397172 4399339 He can't manufacture<br />evidence outta thin air.
4399506 4401214 If he does,<br />I'm ready for him.
4409922 4411006 Well?
4414839 4416172 I've been getting calls.
4416339 4417506 From whom?
4418172 4419547 Well, Clara.
4419714 4423339 You need to let her see<br />her husband. She has rights.
4424089 4426881 That's not your decision.<br />That's Legal's call.
4427214 4429547 Yeah, but it's only<br />a question of time
4429631 4431506 before she turns up<br />on television.
4431839 4433339 Well, she can try.
4434006 4436881 I'll issue a gag order before<br />I let her see her husband.
4438339 4439714 I'd hop to it.
4440506 4443131 Alex. Alex!
4445506 4448297 Alex. You need to come home.
4448464 4449839 Clara, please stand aside.
4450006 4451339 You need to speak<br />to your son.
4451506 4453464 Right now, I see three<br />crimes in progress.
4453631 4455047 Alex, listen to me.
4456506 4457506 I know you're in there.
4459964 4462172 David won't show<br />his face at school.
4463131 4464631 He's having nightmares.
4466464 4469172 He's falling apart.<br />I am falling apart.
4470464 4471672 Please.
4473506 4475547 I can't do this on my own.
4476047 4479172 He's been scared<br />ever since that night.
4488631 4489881 What do you think<br />she's gonna do?
4490964 4492506 What's he gonna do?
4513339 4514672 Are you okay?
4514839 4516839 David? David.
4517672 4520006 Stand back.<br />Come on, stand back!
4540464 4542506 He's supposed to be<br />watching this.
4542672 4547256 Instead, he's accessing images of<br />Clara and David arriving at school.
4547339 4548631 Over and over again.
4549214 4553381 Somehow, he's overriding<br />the system's priorities.
4563881 4565964 - Do you want me to shut<br />him down? DR. - No.
4566131 4567506 Not yet.
4569006 4570714 I wanna see what happens.
4590631 4592547 What's he doing<br />at his house?
4594672 4596714 Look, he's disobeying<br />protocol.
4596797 4598047 You have to shut him down.
4598339 4601297 As far as I can tell,<br />he's still doing his job.
4660881 4663506 Adrian, give me<br />an image of his brain.
4665297 4667714 He's undoing<br />what we did to him.
4668172 4670839 His dopamine levels<br />are coming back to normal.
4671006 4673464 How is that<br />even possible?
4674672 4676964 I haven't the faintest idea.
4677339 4678672 Alex.
4705131 4707506 Alex, please return<br />to the station.
4708547 4710339 I wanna run some tests.
4711172 4712839 Well, this should<br />be interesting.
4729839 4731006 And your phone<br />on the table!
4731131 4733339 We're not cops, all right?<br />We work for Antoine Vallon.
4733506 4735714 - Whoa!<br />- What'd you say?
4736506 4738339 We work for Antoine Vallon.
4767172 4768464 My hand, man!
4768547 4769714 Where's Antoine Vallon?
4769839 4771047 You broke my hand, man!
4771839 4773714 I know you<br />remember me, Jerry.
4777756 4778922 Where's Vallon?
4779006 4780089 Wait a minute.
4780172 4782339 If I tell you where Vallon is,<br />he'll kill my wife and kid, man.
4784464 4787714 Your wife left you in 2019 after<br />filing charges for domestic abuse.
4787797 4789672 And you don't have a kid.
4790131 4791089 But I do.
4792714 4793964 I'm not askin' again!
4794131 4796214 Look, I swear, man. I don't<br />know where Vallon is, okay?
4796381 4799714 The only guy I talk to is his driver<br />Marcus. That's it, man. That's it!
4800297 4802172 Does he have a phone number?
4818506 4821714 We have a problem.<br />Alex is breaking protocol.
4821881 4822881 What's he doing?
4823047 4825172 He's off solving<br />his own murder.
4825339 4828089 Oh, that is genius.
4828506 4830131 Why didn't I think of that?
4837172 4838672 How long<br />till he gets here?
4838839 4840839 Five minutes.<br />All right.
4841214 4842881 Johnny, you stay<br />on these monitors.
4843047 4844339 What happened?
4845631 4848339 Some idiot used<br />an unencrypted phone.
4849672 4850797 Shit.
4859047 4860672 All right, everyone,<br />listen up!
4861047 4862339 He's coming.
4862506 4865339 He leaves alive, you don't.
4866506 4868172 How do we stop him?
4869547 4872714 .50 caliber and above.<br />Aim for the head.
4884672 4886172 This one's set.
4886464 4887631 Let's go. Go!
4887797 4889131 All right, move! Let's go!
4890506 4892339 Come on. Come on!
4894131 4895131 Ready to go!
4896172 4897506 They're all set.
4985381 4986672 Finish it!
5001047 5002339 You freak, die!
5051547 5052839 Watch out.
5053172 5054631 Need me<br />to call a doctor?
5054797 5056797 Come on, Jack.<br />You're gonna like this.
5059506 5060589 What the hell<br />you doin' here?
5060672 5061964 Y'all gonna play<br />good cop, bad cop?
5062047 5064756 Nah, Daniels.<br />Bad cop, RoboCop.
5066714 5069839 I've recovered 26<br />guns from Vallon's warehouse.
5070006 5072797 Thirteen serial numbers match<br />weapons missing from Evidence.
5072964 5074797 And I got your prints<br />all over 'em.
5074964 5075964 This is bullshit.
5076131 5077922 I also<br />have CCTV footage
5078006 5080006 of you and Vallon the<br />same day he tried to kill me.
5080172 5082339 So put him on the<br />payroll. Why we talkin' about this?
5082506 5085797 It won't work. Now that his<br />partner got hit, he's never gonna let it go.
5085964 5087381 - What is that?<br />- Lewis' hospital.
5087547 5089006 Murphy's dropping by<br />this afternoon.
5089172 5092047 I kill a cop, I'm lookin'<br />over my shoulder...
5092214 5094506 You know what they do<br />to cops in prison, man?
5094964 5097547 Being locked up with the<br />same dudes you put in there?
5100881 5102589 How long you think<br />before he gives you up?
5106339 5109006 Don't shoot me. Okay?
5110006 5112339 I swear to Christ.<br />It was Dean.
5112506 5115381 She helped pull those guns.<br />Just don't shoot me.
5117339 5119339 Thank you<br />for your cooperation.
5121464 5123006 You can cuff him now, Jack.
5132089 5133964 Now I know why we<br />couldn't get an arrest.
5135297 5137381 "Cause Vallon was protected<br />from up on high.
5137464 5139172 Alex, I can explain.
5139839 5141214 You tipped<br />him off today.
5141297 5142547 Come on, man.<br />Don't do this.
5142631 5144547 You tried to kill me twice.
5144631 5147922 I trusted you.<br />And you destroyed my family.
5148214 5149214 Confess.
5150547 5152214 Now, in front of everyone.
5152339 5153339 Confess!
5163172 5164172 What happened?
5164339 5166464 Tin Man is down.<br />Had to be done.
5166631 5167631 Why?
5167797 5169047 Product shot a corrupt cop.
5169131 5170589 Two more seconds,<br />the chief's brains
5170672 5173172 would've been splattered<br />across the 6:00 news.
5173631 5174714 We got anything on her?
5174881 5177214 Well, she's the Chief of<br />the Detroit Police Department.
5177297 5179172 What do you think?
5183006 5184297 You know what?
5185714 5188964 This might actually tip<br />this thing right into the net.
5195381 5198547 Alex, I<br />don't know if you can hear me.
5198839 5202131 But tonight,<br />you uncovered a nest of vipers
5202297 5204714 inside<br />the Detroit Police Department.
5204881 5209214 And in so doing, you shed<br />light on an invaluable truth.
5209839 5211297 Even the police,
5211381 5215381 the men and women<br />who swore to keep us safe,
5216172 5217672 they can be bribed.
5218297 5221172 They can be bought.
5222797 5226922 Machines, however,<br />are corruption free.
5227881 5230089 Americans could be<br />living in a country
5230172 5233506 where law enforcement<br />is not only efficient,
5233839 5235339 but incorruptible.
5236672 5238964 Thank you, Alex,<br />for all you've done.
5239131 5240839 And for all that you are.
5241339 5244506 Detective Murphy is<br />currently in critical condition.
5245172 5247922 Our doctors<br />are working ceaselessly
5248006 5250756 but, at this time, it is<br />unclear if he will survive.
5252047 5254047 Ms. Kline,<br />how do you think the attempt
5254131 5256006 on Detective<br />Alex Murphy's life
5256089 5258381 will affect tomorrow's vote<br />for the Dreyfus Act?
5258464 5260339 At this time,<br />Omnicorp's sole concern
5260422 5262506 is the full recovery<br />of Detective Murphy.
5263631 5265797 How many times<br />does Detective Murphy
5265881 5268297 have to give his life<br />for his country?
5268964 5273797 I sincerely hope the Senate<br />makes the right vote tomorrow
5273881 5278464 so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices<br />will not have been in vain.
5283172 5285422 Senator Dreyfus is my friend.
5285506 5288297 He has been<br />my mentor and my strength
5288381 5290839 in times of difficulty<br />on this floor.
5291339 5294422 But despite all that,<br />I work for the state of Ohio,
5294506 5297631 and the safety of its citizens<br />is my top priority.
5298006 5299047 So I vote yes.
5299214 5301506 The Dreyfus Act<br />must be repealed.
5301839 5304006 That's us ahead,<br />39 to 10.
5304172 5307089 I spoke to the Senate liaison<br />and it looks like it's in the bag,
5307172 5310256 but we still have to tread<br />carefully with the politicians.
5311839 5314089 We're here live<br />at DPD headquarters
5314172 5316922 where moments ago, Clara<br />Murphy made a shocking statement.
5317006 5318214 What the hell?
5318297 5323339 Omnicorp has denied me and<br />my son access to Alex for weeks.
5324006 5325839 I demand to know why.
5326839 5331839 This treatment is inhuman and<br />somebody needs to be held accountable.
5333047 5334839 Oh, we're fucked.
5335006 5336381 No, we only need 12 votes.
5336464 5337964 She shouldn't make<br />much difference.
5338131 5340339 Yeah, but what about<br />after the vote?
5340422 5342256 I mean, those two should<br />not be allowed contact.
5342339 5344756 If she starts<br />putting ideas in his head...
5344881 5347547 Bring her in.<br />I'll handle the explanation.
5347714 5349172 And what about Alex?
5349256 5351506 You know, unfortunately,<br />we can't just keep him on ice.
5352172 5354714 The shooting at the station<br />spooked some of the politicians.
5354797 5357297 They're our clients.<br />We have to take care of them.
5357464 5360881 They're fine when a machine<br />is lowering the murder rate,
5360964 5364256 but when a man is investigating<br />city politics, they get nervous.
5364339 5366714 All right. First off,<br />it's not a man, okay?
5366797 5368756 It's property of Omnicorp.
5368839 5371089 And politics are<br />the least of your concern.
5371172 5372839 I mean, this thing<br />solved its own murder.
5373006 5375381 How long till it realizes you<br />haven't been on the level with it?
5375464 5376589 If that happens,
5376672 5379589 every journalist in this<br />country is dying to speak to him.
5379672 5381631 I mean, we created a hero.
5382172 5384839 What happens<br />when he opens his mouth?
5388339 5390047 What's bigger than a hero?
5401714 5403006 Dead hero.
5407339 5409297 Get me Dr. Norton.
5418339 5419464 What is this, Raymond?
5420589 5424589 You have Mattox spying on me and now<br />this bullshit about a "critical condition"?
5424756 5427464 You know and I know<br />Alex is fine!
5427631 5428797 Calm down.
5428964 5430464 Dennett.
5430631 5431797 Your work is so good,<br />I don't...
5431881 5433214 Well, now,<br />this is not about my work!
5433297 5435214 You saw the woman on TV!
5435381 5437506 This has to stop!
5439339 5440631 You're right.
5441339 5443339 But let me<br />ask you something, Dennett.
5443506 5445922 What kind of life have we<br />really given Alex Murphy?
5446006 5449547 He's never gonna be a normal<br />man, a father, a husband.
5449631 5452881 By the time we put the other<br />units on the street, he's just...
5453047 5454131 Dennett.
5456006 5457506 Let's face it.
5458339 5459839 We failed him.
5461297 5463214 We failed Alex Murphy.
5463297 5464922 But I want you to think<br />about the bigger picture
5465006 5466506 because that's what<br />we're talking about.
5466631 5469381 The work you've done with him<br />is gonna be studied for decades.
5469464 5471672 You've changed<br />the face of history, Dennett.
5471756 5476047 No policeman is ever going<br />to die in the line of duty again
5476797 5478339 because of you.
5480006 5481464 You think about that.
5489964 5493922 I want that family<br />taken care of
5494006 5495506 beyond their wildest dreams.
5495547 5497631 We owe them that.<br />I agree.
5498381 5501714 I want full funding.<br />Ten years.
5502131 5503797 New staff, all my own people.
5503964 5505506 Fantastic.
5506214 5507214 Deal.
5517589 5519089 Hey. What's going on?
5519172 5521256 Security's here.<br />They're clearing everyone out.
5521339 5523089 They're not waking him up.
5523172 5525047 Whatever you do,<br />don't leave him alone.
5525131 5526672 What do you mean<br />they're not waking him up?
5528464 5529881 The voting period has ended.
5529964 5532547 The clerks have<br />tabulated the results.
5532631 5534672 The yeas are 63.
5534756 5537464 The nays are 22.
5537547 5540047 A majority of senators have<br />voted in the affirmative.
5540131 5543881 The Dreyfus Act has been<br />repealed by Congress.
5549381 5551922 God, you guys are slow,<br />like a bunch of girls.
5552006 5553089 This is Mattox.
5553172 5554547 Dennett's on board.
5554631 5556214 It's about time.
5561297 5562422 Call it.
5563172 5564589 Get it done.
5565589 5567006 My pleasure.
5575714 5577922 Mrs. Murphy... You can come<br />here as much as you want.
5578006 5581256 You can threaten me. You can<br />sue me. You can take my home.
5581339 5584256 But I am not gonna stop till I see<br />my husband. Do you understand that?
5584547 5587297 Mr. Sellars would<br />very much like to see you.
5588839 5590339 Is Alex okay?
5590589 5594047 He has important information to<br />share with you. Will you accompany me?
5596381 5597547 David.
5599256 5601506 We gotta go.<br />Can you grab your coat?
5602839 5603839 Hey!
5603922 5604964 I'm in the<br />elevator, on my way down.
5605047 5606589 I need access to the lab.
5606672 5608297 That's insane.<br />They're still here.
5608381 5610089 Distract them.
5610172 5611297 Okay.
5612506 5613547 I cannot...
5613631 5615797 There's a lady in here going hysterical.
5615881 5617756 She will not let us in. She's<br />got the codes for the door.
5617839 5619506 I repeat,<br />she will not let us in.
5619589 5621881 Lady, you need to let us in<br />there now. We have to get in there.
5621964 5623464 Are you not understanding<br />what I'm saying?
5623547 5626381 Do you wanna be responsible for<br />the deaths of everyone in this building?
5626672 5628047 Hey! Stop!
5632214 5633339 Don't shoot!
5633422 5634797 Step outside.
5641256 5642922 Unlock the transmitter!
5644297 5645297 Transmitter<br />unlocked!
5652756 5654631 Send in Mrs. Murphy, please.
5654714 5656172 Right away, sir.
5658339 5659589 Wake him up!
5660006 5663089 Alex! Alex!
5663506 5666672 Alex, it's Dr. Norton,<br />you have to wake up!
5666756 5667964 Alex, can you hear me?
5669506 5671256 These men are here<br />to kill us.
5671339 5673797 They're here to Kill us,<br />for Christ sakes!
5678672 5680381 Mrs. Murphy, last night,
5680464 5682464 Alex had a psychotic break.
5682547 5686839 He killed an unarmed colleague<br />and later suffered a seizure.
5687964 5689464 We did everything,
5689547 5692464 everything, we could, but<br />the doctors couldn't save him.
5693922 5695964 Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.
5696256 5698797 We're going to be making<br />the announcement shortly.
5699256 5701714 You shut me down. I was<br />about to get a confession.
5702339 5704006 Mattox shut you down.
5705339 5708214 I've removed your transmitter<br />so he won't do it again.
5708631 5710797 Sellars can't afford<br />to wake you up.
5711839 5713964 He sent these guys<br />to pull the plug.
5714422 5717922 He wants you dead, Alex.<br />Do you understand?
5718089 5719922 Sorry. If there's<br />anything we can do
5720006 5721339 for you and David,<br />we'll do it.
5721506 5723631 I want nothing from you.
5724589 5725881 I understand.
5726464 5728756 You stay out of our lives.
5730172 5731381 You and your company.
5731672 5733547 If that's what<br />you think is best.
5734506 5735964 There's one more thing.
5736047 5738881 I think it would be to the benefit<br />of everyone, especially David
5738964 5741172 if we kept<br />this matter private.
5741422 5743964 We don't wanna<br />damage Alex's legacy.
5746631 5748464 Alex! Alex!
5748839 5750464 I can fix this!
5750547 5752006 You lied to me.
5752089 5753339 You lied to my wife.
5753422 5755047 You're working for the people<br />that are trying to kill me.
5755131 5756381 You want me<br />to trust you, Doctor?
5756464 5758506 Alex, I can go to the press!
5759922 5762506 Alex, I can tell them<br />the whole story!
5762797 5764256 Alex!
5764797 5766714 Listen to me, please!
5767714 5771006 Alex! Alex!
5782631 5783672 What the hell?
5792047 5793422 Keep all our systems<br />at green light,
5793506 5795589 and for Christ sakes,<br />get Sellars on the phone.
5795672 5796672 Roger that.
5796756 5798714 Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!
5800047 5801631 Look at this city.
5803464 5805006 So beautiful.
5806006 5808672 It's become so peaceful.
5811464 5812797 I wish
5813797 5816047 I had some good news<br />for Detroit.
5816547 5818297 I have very sad news.
5818464 5821131 Despite our best efforts<br />to save him,
5821422 5823881 Alex Murphy passed away<br />just hours ago.
5824297 5825589 Alex Murphy was...
5825672 5826881 Mr. Sellars.
5827297 5828881 What is it?<br />Mattox just called.
5829464 5831297 We need you to<br />come with us now.
5837589 5839381 Ma'am, I need you to turn around<br />and go the other way, please.
5839506 5841506 What are you talking about?<br />We have a security situation here.
5841589 5843006 I need you to turn around<br />and go the other way.
5843089 5844964 Sir, there's a car outside<br />that's supposed to...
5845047 5846672 That area is locked down.<br />Now go.
5846756 5848422 What's happening?<br />I said go! o
5848756 5850756 I wanna talk to Mr. Sellars.
5853672 5854756 Mr. Sellars.
5854922 5856881 How close is that helicopter?<br />About 10 minutes, sir.
5874714 5875964 Yes?<br />Excuse me.
5876131 5878464 I need to speak with<br />Sergeant Jack Lewis.
5878631 5879839 It's an emergency.
5880006 5881631 Stand by. Mr. Sellars.
5882089 5883797 Apparently there's a<br />Clara Murphy in the lobby.
5883964 5887297 Raymond, if she sees him,<br />we are dead in the water.
5887464 5889797 What do you wanna do?<br />Bring Mrs. Murphy up here.
5889964 5891047 Yes, sir.
5894964 5897756 Norton said they may be<br />using drones for protection.
5897922 5899964 So whatever you do,<br />do not draw your weapons.
5900131 5902756 They won't shoot<br />if we're unarmed. Clear?
5902839 5903839 Clear.<br />Clear.
5920214 5921589 Hold it right there.
5922589 5923589 Don't move.
5927339 5930672 This is private property. You<br />are not authorized to be here!
5934589 5936922 I'd put those guns down now<br />if I were you.
5937089 5938756 Stand down.<br />All right, man, we're good.
5985172 5986506 Head to the lower level.
5988131 5989131 Hold up, hold up!
5989256 5990464 Ram it!
6050672 6051964 Gun it.
6053422 6055006 Go, go, go! Now!
6070964 6072464 Alex, run!
6073297 6075339 Omnicorp Security!<br />Drop your weapons!
6075506 6077422 Drop your weapon.
6077589 6080381 Keep your hands above your<br />head and no one will be harmed.
6095631 6096756 What's going on?
6096839 6099089 Mrs. Murphy, I want you to<br />listen to me carefully.
6099256 6101756 The organic part of<br />your husband Alex is dead.
6101839 6103964 The robotic part of him<br />is malfunctioning,
6104047 6105131 and he's shooting up<br />the building.
6105214 6108006 So we've gotta get you and<br />your son out of here right away.
6108172 6109714 I gotta take this call.
6111006 6112589 He just left the lobby<br />and he's headed our way.
6112672 6114214 Roger that, sir.
6114631 6117672 Don't shoot. My robot.<br />You just flank. Got it.
6117839 6119089 Tin Man.
6121839 6123047 Tin Man.
6124089 6125339 Tin Man.
6125922 6127089 Oh, there it is.
6127756 6129131 You look like crap.
6131756 6132922 What's the matter?
6133089 6134297 Can't shoot?
6136089 6137172 Huh?
6137922 6140006 What were you thinking?<br />This isn't a drill.
6140089 6141089 You're a robot.
6141297 6143506 I'm a red asset.<br />Wrote that myself.
6143964 6145256 What do you think?
6145672 6148506 Come on, Tin Man,<br />just pull the trigger.
6148672 6149672 Pull it.
6150464 6151547 You can run.
6152089 6153089 Go on.
6153339 6154464 Run.
6154922 6156047 Run!
6156381 6158214 There you go. Run.
6158672 6160006 Run. Run!
6163172 6164589 Whoo!
6164672 6166797 Stings like a bitch,<br />don't it?
6166964 6170256 Aren't you lucky I didn't<br />have my gun set to "kill"?
6171506 6172839 Hey, listen.
6173297 6174881 This isn't personal.
6175922 6177672 Well, maybe a little.
6179422 6181256 I'm gonna put you<br />out of your misery.
6192964 6194422 Helicopter's approaching.
6194506 6195756 Mr. Sellars boards first.
6195839 6198797 No, no, no. Mrs. Murphy, you<br />and your son can get on first.
6204214 6205506 Officer down.
6205589 6206714 Mechanical room.
6206797 6208381 Omnicorp Building.
6208547 6210422 Roger that. EMS on the way.
6212047 6213631 You're gonna be okay, Jack.
6213714 6214964 It's nonfatal.
6215047 6216631 Go. Go.
6217839 6220631 Omni-LZ Helo-1<br />on approach to deck.
6227381 6228381 What's that?
6230297 6231422 He's got a gun!<br />What?
6231589 6232589 Pull up! Pull up!
6237547 6239839 What the hell is he doing?<br />Sorry, sir. I don't know.
6245381 6246381 Alex?
6246547 6247547 Dad?
6250964 6252381 Clara, David.
6253381 6254547 Whoa, whoa,<br />whoa, whoa.
6254631 6255631 Wait.
6256714 6258589 Get out of the way.<br />Alex, put down the gun.
6258756 6260839 Clara, take David<br />and get out of the way now!
6262714 6264089 Raymond Sellars,<br />you're under arrest
6264172 6265922 for the attempted murder<br />of a police officer.
6269631 6272131 Are you here to cuff me?<br />All right.
6272922 6274381 Go 'head, cuff me.
6275589 6278172 You can't. You're not<br />programmed that way.
6278256 6279756 If you go against<br />the program,
6279839 6281672 the entire system<br />shuts down, so.
6281839 6283922 You don't even have a<br />warrant. We'll overlook this little...
6284089 6286172 Get down on the ground and<br />put your hands behind your back.
6286339 6287339 I'm just from marketing.
6287506 6289839 Now!<br />Okay, yep, yep, yep. Yep.
6290006 6292172 Alex, we need to<br />work together here.
6292339 6295422 Because I'm the only one with<br />the technology to keep you alive.
6296547 6298172 Dead or alive,<br />you're coming with me.
6304297 6305297 All right.
6305464 6306464 Weapon.
6308131 6311256 Alex, honestly,<br />I mean you no harm.
6311422 6313714 If I wanted to, I could have<br />killed you a long time ago.
6313881 6315756 I just aim this right at<br />your head and blow it off.
6315839 6317672 Sellars, please! Don't!
6317839 6320381 I mean, if I wanted to, I could<br />just aim this at your little family
6321714 6323297 and I could just<br />kill them too.
6323422 6325089 And really, there's nothing<br />you could do about it
6325172 6327172 because, let's face it,
6327797 6329131 you're a robot.
6329756 6331214 Do you understand that?
6335464 6336464 Alex.
6339631 6340881 Dad!
6345006 6346256 Baby.
6351839 6352922 Hey.
6354547 6355547 Hey.
6356047 6358047 Everything's gonna be<br />all right.
6359006 6361256 Everything's gonna be<br />all right.
6411089 6412839 How you feeling, Alex?
6414756 6415881 I'm ready.
6453631 6455006 He's ready.
6489089 6490256 There's still no word
6490339 6493339 from Omnicorp<br />parent company, OCP.
6494256 6498006 And although the government<br />says they are rebuilding Alex Murphy,
6498089 6500797 rumors continue to swirl<br />about his condition.
6500881 6505422 But we have obtained exclusive<br />video taken by cell phone
6505506 6507922 that shows<br />the people of Detroit
6508006 6510089 may have Alex Murphy<br />back on the streets
6510172 6511756 sooner than they think.
6513797 6515297 The real tragedy here
6515381 6520172 is that our president chose<br />to uphold the Dreyfus Act.
6521547 6526297 Now, I have no doubt he was<br />manipulated by our biased media
6526381 6529839 and by whistle-blower<br />Dennett Norton.
6529922 6533672 I acknowledge we know<br />less than we thought.
6534672 6537589 But I do believe<br />my research program is sound.
6539172 6540422 What I did with it
6541922 6542964 was wrong.
6543047 6546047 The fact that this<br />mother...
6546131 6549381 Is not serving time<br />in some federal penitentiary
6549464 6553464 is a huge, hot, heaping<br />pile of horse...
6559214 6563589 Now I know some of you may think<br />that this kind of thinking is dangerous
6563672 6567672 and these machines<br />violate your civil liberties.
6567839 6571964 Some of you even believe that<br />the use of these drones overseas
6572047 6576714 makes us the same kind of<br />bullying imperialists
6576797 6579547 that our forefathers<br />were trying to escape.
6580006 6582464 To you, I say...
6582631 6585006 Stop whining!
6586839 6589464 America is now
6589547 6591839 and always will be
6591922 6596339 the greatest country<br />on the face of the Earth!
6600881 6602422 I'm Pat Novak.
6603922 6605172 Good night.
6612131 6615297 Breakin' rocks in the hot sun
6615381 6618381 I fought the law<br />and the law won
6618797 6621589 I fought the law<br />and the law won

6643922 6646589 I fought the law and the
6647089 6650256 Robbin' people with a six gun

6653464 6656589 I fought the law<br />and the law won
6656672 6659756 I lost my girl<br />and I lost my fun
