59061 62814 What if I told you<br />that even the worst<br />neighborhood in America
62898 64983 could be made<br />completely safe.
65150 68070 And what if I told you<br />that this could<br />be accomplished
68153 69363 without risking the life
69446 72324 of one single<br />law enforcement officer.
72491 73909 How do I know this?
73992 76203 Because it's happening<br />right now
76286 78580 in every country<br />in the world
78664 80457 but this one.
81041 84503 I'm Pat Novak,<br />and welcome to<br /><i>The Novak Element.</i>

89216 90759 In tonight's<br />State of the Union segment
90842 92886 we'll be joined<br />by General Curtis Monroe
92970 95180 live from the War Room<br />in the Pentagon.
96848 98684 General Monroe,<br />welcome back.
98809 99935 <i>Good to see you, Pat.</i>
100018 104356 Thank you for<br />this unprecedented access<br />to your operations.
104523 108151 Could you walk us through<br />what we're seeing here?
108318 110529 <i>Well, this is<br />a routine operation.</i>
110654 112781 <i>We found that<br />random patrols</i>
112864 116243 <i>helped the local population<br />to feel safer<br />and to trust us.</i>
116326 117327 It's amazing.
117452 119746 And what are<br />these colored dots
119830 121331 that we're seeing here,<br />General?
121498 124418 <i>These are our assets<br />on the ground.</i>
124501 127087 <i>In green,<br />we got the ED-209s.</i>
127170 129881 <i>They're the big boys.<br />They secure the perimeter.</i>
130048 132217 <i>Purple are<br />the smaller EM-208s.</i>
132301 133844 <i>They sweep and mop up.</i>
134011 136888 <i>And the red dots, Pat,<br />that's your film crew.</i>
136972 138098 (LAUGHS)
138640 141101 It is great to see<br />American machines
141184 144479 helping to promote<br />peace and freedom abroad.
144563 146315 <i>All right, you guys,<br />this is a standard op,<br />all right?</i>
146398 147774 <i>There's no<br />opposition expected.</i>
147858 150027 <i>I'm gonna set your markers<br />to code red.</i>

158201 159328 Okay.<br />Okay?
159411 160746 Does that<br />make you feel better?

164666 165751 <i>Okay?</i>

215592 218512 <i>We apologize<br />for any inconvenience.</i>
220722 222307 <i>May peace be upon you.</i>

234069 238323 Not long ago,<br />that would have been<br />American men and women
238407 241576 risking their lives<br />to pacify these people.
242661 244871 General, you care<br />to comment on this?
244955 247416 <i>Well, Pat,<br />we had Vietnam,</i>
247499 250293 <i>we had Iraq,<br />we had Afghanistan.</i>
250836 252045 <i>Never again.</i>
252129 255590 <i>From a military perspective,<br />this has been invaluable.</i>
255757 257467 <i>We can accomplish<br />our objectives</i>
257551 259594 <i>without any loss<br />to American lives</i>
259678 263014 <i>and I think<br />the honest people over there<br />really appreciate it.</i>

265016 267352 For the first time<br />in their lives
267436 269771 they get to watch<br />their children grow up

458501 462839 Why can't we use<br />these machines<br />here at home?
463173 467969 Why is America<br />so robophobic?
468887 471890 On the one hand,<br />we have Raymond Sellars.
472807 475977 An entrepreneur<br />and true American
476061 479230 whose product just saved<br />my colleague's life.
479522 481608 And on the other.
481691 484110 Hubert Dreyfus.
484194 488239 A man with<br />both feet planted<br />firmly in the past
488490 492702 whose bill prohibits<br />the use of drones<br />on US soil.
492869 495914 The American people<br />support the Dreyfus Act
496081 499542 because they haven't<br />experienced this technology
499709 502754 and they fear<br />what they don't understand.
503380 506758 We at <i>The Novak Element</i><br />support Mr. Sellars' efforts
507092 510178 to make our country<br />and our viewers safer.
510345 512263 After all,
512347 516393 what's more important<br />than the safety<br />of the American people?

866868 868953 That's up to IAD.
869412 870913 I'll handle it.
876586 881257 I don't care how<br />sophisticated these<br />machines are, Mr. Sellars.
881466 885970 A machine does not know<br />what it feels like<br />to be human.
886137 888514 It can't understand<br />the value of human life.
888598 890099 Why should it be<br />allowed to take one?
890183 891184 (APPLAUSE)
891309 894687 To legislate<br />over life and death,
894771 898566 we need people<br />who understand<br />right from wrong.
898900 900985 What do your machines feel?
901152 904614 Well, they feel no anger.<br />They feel no prejudice.
904781 909327 They feel no fatigue,<br />which makes them ideal<br />for law enforcement.
910328 913498 Putting these machines<br />on the streets

927512 928971 what would it feel?
929055 930306 (SIGHS)
932600 934477 Nothing.<br />And that's the problem.

940024 941859 (APPLAUSE)
946781 950910 POPE: America is the world's<br />most valuable market,<br />and we can't touch it.
951202 956499 With a domestic expansion,<br />we'd clear $600 billion<br />per annum.
956666 961546 In other words, every second<br />that law is in existence,<br />we are hemorrhaging money.
961712 962713 What do you<br />want me to do?
962880 966217 We've thrown cash at senators<br />at both sides of the aisle.<br />Nobody's budging.
966384 968302 They don't want<br />to vote against<br />their constituents.
968469 971514 So unless<br />we sway public opinion,<br />the battle's lost.

2197155 2199366 <i>It's so good<br />to finally see you.</i>
2199532 2201868 I was gonna say<br />the same thing.
2203036 2204496 I'm sorry.
2205455 2207832 I know how I must<br />look to you.
2207999 2210335 <i>I think you look beautiful.</i>
2214214 2216132 <i>Are they treating you okay,<br />baby?</i>
2216299 2220720 So far. Dr. Norton,<br />he seems like a nice guy.
2222180 2224224 Does David know<br />you're calling?
2227685 2229270 <i>He misses you.</i>
2230021 2232148 <i>I can go get him.</i><br />No.
2233483 2235693 I don't want him<br />to see me like this.
2237862 2238947 Not yet.
2239239 2240323 <i>Sure.</i>
2246204 2248706 <i>We're gonna<br />get through this, baby.</i>
2251418 2253795 <i>We're gonna make it<br />like it was.</i>
2258341 2259843 <i>When are you comin' home?</i>
2260009 2262345 Well, they've still<br />got some tests.
2263430 2265557 But they're sayin'<br />it's goin' really well.
2267475 2268977 The minute they let me.
2271396 2272939 I gotta go.
2274065 2275358 I love you.
2275525 2277152 End the connection.
2291541 2295378 Okay,<br />blood cleansing initiated.
2297172 2300758 Viral and bacterial<br />screening activated.

2333791 2336127 Let's give him a nice dream.
2347263 2348765 MATTOX: All right,<br />here's what you're<br />dealin' with.
2349015 2351559 Modified M2 battle rifle.
2351726 2354103 .50 caliber Beowulf<br />ammunition at 30 round clips.
2354229 2356022 Three-shot bursts<br />or full auto.
2357357 2358399 Heavy-duty.
2359734 2362862 TSR 66. Cartridge-driven<br />taser pistol.
2363029 2367367 Each projectile releases<br />up to 200,000 volts.<br />It can stun, it can kill
2367534 2368910 and it's nasty shit.
2369285 2370328 Your armor,
2370411 2371746 state-of-the-art,<br />but not invulnerable.
2371913 2374457 .50 caliber or larger<br />can penetrate and kill.
2374624 2378336 Multiple hits, and<br />guess who ends up<br />in the recycling bin?
2380672 2382549 If you sense<br />you need a weapon<br />or are threatened
2384551 2387679 the visor goes down<br />and the system makes<br />the weapons available.
2387845 2390723 But you gotta remember,<br />it's not the weapons<br />that count.
2390807 2391849 It's who's handling them.
2391933 2394143 Or, in your case, what.
2394561 2397063 You think you can do this?<br />Oh, just stick to your job.
2397188 2400024 Just stick to my job?<br />Combat robots are my job, Doc.
2400191 2404279 Rio, Congo,<br />you name it, I was there.<br />Our machines run perfectly.
2404445 2406489 You ask me, stickin'<br />organics into the system
2406573 2408658 is a huge step backwards.
2409117 2411035 I don't care<br />how well you<br />designed this thing.
2411202 2413496 Without my sign-off,<br />it better start<br />learnin' Chinese,
2413580 2415039 'cause it ain't<br />never goin' home.
2422589 2424465 It's nice to meet you, too.
2425883 2427468 Let's do this,
2427802 2429095 Tin Man.
2435435 2439439 Quality control,<br />EM-208 versus Tin Man.
2439606 2442525 Rendering scenario one now.
2443359 2444986 Hey, Doc,<br />hope you don't mind.
2445069 2446195 I like a little music<br />while I'm workin'.
2446279 2447530 (<i>IF I ONLY HAD</i><br /><i>A HEART</i> PLAYING)
2447614 2450241 <i>When a man's an empty kettle</i>
2450408 2455371 All right. All right,<br />let's let the games begin.<br />Let's rock 'n' roll.
2457290 2458541 Commence scenario.
2458708 2461711 <i>Just because I'm presumin'<br />That I could be kind of human</i>
2461878 2465089 <i>If I only had a heart</i>
2466215 2471137 <i>I'd be tender, I'd be gentle<br />And awful sentimental</i>
2471304 2473765 <i>Regarding love and art</i>
2475141 2477602 <i>I'd be friends<br />with the sparrows</i>
2477685 2479771 <i>And the boy<br />who shoots the arrows</i>
2479937 2482815 <i>If I only had a heart</i>
2484734 2488404 <i>Picture me a balcony</i>
2489447 2492408 <i>Above a voice sings low...</i>
2492617 2494369 MATTOX:<br />Laggin' on the corners.<br />(GROANS)
2494452 2495953 No, there,<br />d'you see that?
2496037 2497914 What my robot did,<br />that's how you do it.
2500249 2501459 New product's afraid.
2502335 2505672 2.3 seconds behind. Great.
2507256 2508549 FEMALE HOSTAGE:<br /><i>Don't shoot! He has a gun!</i>
2508633 2509676 <i>Drop your gun!</i>
2512136 2513137 <i>Drop your gun!</i>
2514097 2515598 <i>Drop the weapon.<br />Let the kid go!</i>
2515765 2518935 Oh, well, it's worried that<br />the kid's gonna get hurt.
2519102 2520603 <i>Let the kid go!</i><br />MATTOX: Too bad.
2522146 2526109 Well, there you have it.<br />5.6 seconds behind.<br />Scenario failure.
2526275 2528152 I wouldn't buy that<br />for a dollar.
2533616 2536035 Let's do it again.<br />Your funeral.
2539831 2540915 Detective Alex Murphy.
2541082 2542291 FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:<br /><i>Search results.</i>
2542375 2544419 <i>"Detective Murphy<br />making a speedy recovery."</i>
2544585 2546713 <i>"Alex Murphy.<br />Man or Machine?"</i>
2546879 2550258 <i>"Thrust into the spotlight,<br />Clara Murphy won't talk."</i>
2551300 2552885 Antoine Vallon.
2552969 2554053 FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:<br /><i>Search results.</i>
2554137 2558266 <i>"DPD says Antoine Vallon<br />no longer suspect<br />due to lack of evidence."</i>
2558349 2559475 (SCOFFS)
2561811 2563688 <i>Detroit Free Press.</i>
2563855 2566941 <i>Unfortunately,<br />Murphy's investigation<br />into Antoine Vallon</i>
2567024 2568443 <i>wasn't authorized<br />in the first place.</i>
2568526 2572238 <i>Look, Detective Murphy was<br />simply overzealous, okay?</i>
2572321 2575450 <i>We have absolutely<br />no evidence linking Vallon<br />to the attempt on his life.</i>
2575533 2577827 <i>All I'm gonna say is<br />my partner's a great cop.</i>
2577910 2581414 <i>And I won't rest until<br />the men who tried to kill him<br />are brought to justice.</i>
2585293 2586294 SELLARS:<br />What's wrong with him?
2586377 2587462 DR. NORTON:<br />No, nothing, nothing.
2588629 2592049 Watch the procedural bars<br />on the 208.
2592925 2596429 The machine assesses<br />the threat and acts.
2597054 2598431 That's it.
2598931 2601309 It's two steps.<br />Now watch Alex.
2602351 2606439 The software<br />assesses the threat,<br />just like the robot.
2606606 2608483 And it sends the information<br />to the brain.
2608649 2611402 Alex's brain receives<br />the information and<br />decides what to do with it
2611486 2616115 based on his emotional<br />cognitive abilities<br />like any man would.
2616282 2619452 Then the brain relates this<br />to the AI module and...
2619619 2622330 Yeah, like, you know,<br />a year later.
2622413 2623623 DR. NORTON: And our computers<br />finish the job.
2623748 2627460 Raymond, you wanted<br />a man inside a machine.
2627543 2629128 And that's what you've got.
2629212 2631339 But the human element<br />will always be present.
2631422 2634008 Fear, instinct,<br />bias, compassion,
2634091 2635343 they will always interfere<br />with the system!
2635426 2636969 Okay, but, Dennett,<br />(SIGHS)
2637053 2640473 I've gotta give<br />the American people<br />something they can root for.
2640556 2642308 Something aspirational, right?
2642391 2643810 They have to<br />believe in this thing.
2643976 2647396 "Pretty good"?<br />I don't know<br />how to sell "okay."
2647480 2649106 We, you and I,<br />have got a release date,
2649190 2650608 and we've gotta<br />make it, okay?
2650691 2653277 So I don't care how you<br />do it. I'm askin' ya,<br />come on, can you help me?
2653361 2656823 Just get him to do that.<br />Get him to do that.
2656906 2658324 That is a machine.
2658407 2659867 I know, but it's a man<br />inside a machine.
2659951 2662829 No, that's a man<br />inside a machine right there!
2662912 2663996 And his life depends on it.
2664080 2665456 And the future of Omnicorp<br />depends on it
2665540 2668376 so get your ass back to China<br />and get it fixed.
2668459 2670628 I don't care how you do it,<br />just go do it!
2686102 2689188 It tastes like<br />peanut butter.
2693150 2695319 I can't get it<br />out of my mouth.
2696028 2697780 DR. NORTON: And you<br />don't like peanut butter?
2697947 2699156 No.<br />(CHUCKLES)
2699907 2701492 You like peanut butter, Kim?
2701659 2703077 KIM: I love it.
2704787 2706205 Okay.
2707248 2708833 I'm gonna put you<br />to sleep now, Alex.
2708916 2710001 Okay.
2711252 2713254 Now, put him under, Kim.
2714964 2716215 (BEEPING)
2718634 2720344 What are you planning to do?
2721304 2725224 Consciousness<br />is nothing more
2725391 2728102 than the processing<br />of information.
2729645 2731480 I'm gonna fix him.
2732899 2734984 And he won't<br />know the difference.
2746329 2747914 Raymond?<br />Yeah?
2747997 2751459 We just ran focus groups<br />at Ryan Correctional Facility.
2752335 2755421 We call this Combat Mode.
2755588 2758299 It really put the fear of God<br />into the prisoners.
2758466 2759592 Yeah, that's okay.
2759759 2761510 And get a load of this.
2762261 2766098 What's that?<br />He transforms.<br />Kids love it.
2766432 2768768 Really?<br />Focus group numbers<br />through the roof.
2768935 2770269 (CHUCKLES) Really?<br />Oh, yeah.
2770436 2772396 Well, that's really<br />embarrassing.
2772563 2774523 What is this?<br />You know what?
2774690 2776525 People really don't know<br />what they want
2776609 2778819 until you show it to 'em<br />most of the time.
2779654 2781906 (SIGHS) Make him more, uh,
2781989 2782990 tactical.
2783074 2784617 Make him look, uh...
2786786 2788537 Let's go with black.
2789830 2791040 Yeah.
2826200 2827201 Alex.
2827368 2829453 He looks<br />like a billion dollars.
2829620 2831580 2.6 billion.
2832039 2833749 Raymond Sellars.
2834083 2835960 I've looked forward to<br />meeting you, Detective.
2836043 2838129 I really appreciate<br />everything you've<br />done for me.
2838212 2840423 Well, we funded<br />this program
2840506 2842717 to give men like you<br />a second chance.
2843551 2845344 You just do<br />your best today.
2845720 2846971 Shall we?<br />Let's.
2850099 2852560 Mr. Sellars,<br />we're ready for you.<br />Okay, great.
2852727 2854186 Chief Technician Shuman.
2854353 2855730 Mornin', folks.
2858858 2861068 MATTOX OVER RADIO:<br /><i>Okay, so this is</i><br /><i>how it's gonna be.</i>
2861235 2863529 We're goin' toe-to-toe.<br />Last man standing wins.
2864030 2866240 <i>I hit you, you go back<br />to the drawing board.</i>
2866323 2868826 <i>You hit me,<br />you get a ticket back home.</i>
2869994 2872663 My guys are gonna be<br />shootin' .47 caliber rounds.
2872830 2874999 Do a little damage,<br />but they can't take you out.
2875166 2878502 But make no mistake,<br />Tin Man, my gun will.
2883632 2885134 (GUNS COCKING)
2893934 2895102 DR. NORTON:<br />Alex, listen to me.
2895644 2897897 <i>The EM-208s will<br />try to maneuver you</i>
2897980 2899315 <i>so Mattox can<br />get a clear shot.</i>
2900024 2902526 <i>Do not let that happen.</i>
2902651 2905988 <i>If Mattox hits you,<br />everything but your life<br />support will shut down.</i>
2906072 2909200 <i>You'll feel more pain<br />than you've ever felt<br />in your life.</i>
2909533 2912203 I don't know about that.<br />I've been through a lot.
2912286 2913829 (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
2918250 2919460 All right.
2920294 2922171 I say we go on three.
2922338 2923339 Three.
2945319 2946904 How's it going down there?
2949031 2952034 Whatever you do,<br />don't get shot in the face.
2955538 2956539 Wow.
2988737 2991532 LIZ: Dr. Norton,<br />how is he doing this?
2992324 2995828 DR. NORTON:<br />His software is faster.<br />His hardware is stronger.
2995995 2997496 <i>He's a better machine.</i>
3000124 3002334 LIZ: <i>But you said<br />humans hesitate.</i>
3002501 3004795 Only when they're<br />making decisions.
3004879 3006839 He's not<br />making decisions?
3007006 3008757 Yes and no.
3009133 3012052 In his everyday life,<br />man rules over the machine.
3012136 3014180 Alex makes his own decisions.
3014555 3016390 <i>Now, when he<br />engages in battle,</i>
3016473 3019685 <i>the visor comes down<br />and the software takes over.</i>
3019852 3021812 <i>Then the machine<br />does everything.</i>
3021896 3025232 Alex is a passenger,<br />just along for the ride.
3028777 3030154 LIZ: <i>But if the machine<br />is in control,</i>
3030237 3031655 <i>then how is Murphy<br />accountable?</i>
3031864 3032865 Who's pulling the trigger?
3032948 3034325 Well, when<br />the machine fights,
3034408 3036911 the system releases signals<br />into Alex's brain
3036994 3039580 making him think he's<br />doing what our computers<br />are actually doing.
3039663 3042499 I mean,<br />Alex believes right now<br />he is in control.
3042583 3046045 But he's not.<br />It's the illusion<br />of free will.
3055763 3056847 Crap!
3079203 3082122 So you've circumvented the<br />law by creating a machine<br />that thinks it's a man.
3082206 3083207 But that's illegal.
3083374 3085167 No. No, no, no.
3086293 3088671 It's a machine that thinks<br />it's Alex Murphy.
3088837 3090130 And in my book
3090631 3092091 that's legal.
3094051 3095219 Well done.
3096762 3098264 Well done.
3101642 3106105 Hey, Doctor, what happens<br />if I tase an exoskeleton<br />with a little asshole inside?
3107189 3110484 I, uh, I think<br />we're all curious<br />to find out.
3110651 3111986 Go ahead.

3175716 3176842 Hey.
3181221 3182931 There's nothin' to be<br />nervous about.
3183015 3184266 (LAUGHS SOFTLY)
3187686 3188854 Thank you, Dennett.
3189730 3191357 It's been a privilege.

3286160 3287202 Hi, Dad.
3290164 3291874 You know<br />I missed you, buddy.
3292875 3294209 Me, too.
3301383 3302843 Wanna feel it?
3306722 3308015 What is it?
3309391 3310893 It's okay, sweetie.
3322362 3325157 I saved<br />all the Red Wings games<br />on my computer.
3326200 3327576 You did?
3330579 3332539 How'd they do?<br />I don't know.
3332706 3334917 I've been waiting<br />to watch them with you.
3336335 3338170 You know I'd love to, kiddo.
3339004 3340589 But I can't tonight.
3341256 3343592 You know,<br />'cause Daddy's suit<br />needs some...
3344760 3346553 Some special handling.
3348180 3349598 Do you understand?
3381004 3382214 Thanks for coming, Jack.
3382464 3383966 I heard you<br />went home already.
3384049 3385801 I know Clara<br />must be thrilled to<br />have you back.
3385884 3388136 I saw Clara
3388220 3389471 and David.
3392266 3394476 That ain't my home right now.
3395811 3397896 It's in a damn lab<br />across the hall.
3398063 3399773 I'm sorry, Alex.
3400148 3403986 Startin' tomorrow,<br />I'm gonna take down Vallon<br />and his whole damn crew.

3472554 3476808 That means you'll have<br />instantaneous access<br />to criminal records
3476892 3481063 plus an archive<br />of CCTV footage<br />from 2011 to the present.

3630879 3632047 But you'll be<br />taking away his emotions.
3632130 3633882 Drop the levels<br />until I tell you to stop.
3633965 3635967 Doctor, you'll be<br />taking away his ability<br />to feel anything.

3680762 3682848 I feel fine, Dr. Norton.

3771728 3773021 (SCREAMS)
3784032 3787744 Until today, Thomas King<br />was a convicted felon
3787827 3791373 wanted for rape, arson,<br />and murder.
3791665 3795543 This man has torn<br />apart American families.
3795961 3799255 On the loose for six years.
3800465 3805553 And where was this<br />criminal mastermind hiding?
3808723 3813687 Right in front of<br />the police headquarters.
3813853 3818400 Here he is, just steps away<br />from two of Detroit's finest.
3818566 3822487 These two officers<br />are completely unaware
3822570 3825573 of the monster<br />in their midst.
3827867 3830453 (CROWD SCREAMING)<br />And then, in 60 seconds...
3830578 3834541 I repeat, just 60 seconds,
3834708 3838211 Detective Murphy<br />brings him down.

3852058 3855228 now that RoboCop is here?
3856062 3857188 Yes,
3857272 3861776 let's not shy away<br />from what this means, people.
3862277 3866197 Men weren't up to the task.
3866364 3867824 But Alex Murphy,
3868199 3870160 <i>a robot cop,</i>
3870243 3871286 <i>was.</i>
3872579 3873872 We can't take him<br />off the street.
3873955 3875498 This is what I'm saying.<br />He's a hit.
3875582 3877292 A big, fat, stinking hit.
3877375 3879627 Yeah, until he breaks down<br />in front of everyone.
3879711 3882922 Hey, we all knew<br />there would be issues.<br />It's inevitable.
3883089 3885675 Dennett, you're my guy.<br />I just need you<br />to get a handle on this.
3885759 3886885 I know,<br />but I need more time.
3886968 3889471 Scientifically,<br />we're in uncharted water.
3889554 3891723 We need to take him<br />back to the lab<br />and do more tests.
3891806 3895226 I mean,<br />it was like something was<br />interfering with our system.
3895310 3897729 Something beyond<br />chemistry or physics.
3897896 3899731 Like what? His soul?
3899814 3902317 Hey, look, this train has<br />already left the station.
3902400 3904694 I can't exactly go out<br />to the world and say,
3904778 3907280 "Sorry, I released<br />a defective product."
3907447 3910325 So, no matter what we do,<br />we just need to keep him<br />on the streets.
3910492 3912077 What about the interviews?
3912160 3914579 Cancel 'em.<br />Cancel all of 'em.
3914746 3916081 Everything.
3916790 3918500 In fact, Dennett.
3920960 3923838 <i>Let's keep the wife<br />at a distance<br />for now, as well.</i>
3925006 3926174 CLARA: (QUIETLY)<br /><i>I'd like to see him.</i>
3927133 3928468 Can you arrange that?
3928635 3930470 Look, I won't lie to you.
3931012 3934432 Alex was so nervous,<br />we had to sedate him.
3934599 3937268 I looked in his eyes and<br />I couldn't see my husband.
3937352 3941314 And then he just shoots<br />a man in front of our son.<br />That's not sedation.
3942482 3945652 He's responding<br />to drugs differently now.
3947654 3949989 We both knew from day one,
3950657 3953159 there would be complications.
3957455 3959499 Just give me<br />a little more time.
3960458 3962043 I promise,
3963169 3965171 you'll have your husband back.

4257255 4258256 Thanks for havin' me.
4258423 4260925 You must be doing<br />a victory lap about now.
4261008 4262009 Well.
4262093 4266013 Two weeks ago,<br />Omni's stock went<br />through the roof.
4266139 4268433 And the Senate<br />has finally agreed

4277108 4278109 I certainly hope so.

4288327 4290621 Senator, do you know<br />what this is?
4290788 4293541 The American public<br />is divided
4293666 4295042 on the Dreyfus Act.
4295209 4300339 Our polls at Novakelement.com<br />are tight at 50-50.
4300548 4304302 <i>There is no doubt<br />Omnicorp created a sensation</i>
4304385 4307805 <i>but this bill is<br />not about Alex Murphy.</i>

4317148 4318566 and it is a sea change,
4318649 4320318 shows that Americans<br />don't really care
4320401 4323154 if our law enforcement systems<br />are manned or unmanned.
4323237 4326282 What they care about<br />is efficiency and<br />they care about safety.

6566520 6570899 Now I know some of you<br />may think that this<br />kind of thinking is dangerous
6570983 6574987 and these machines<br />violate your civil liberties.
6575154 6579283 Some of you even believe<br />that the use of these<br />drones overseas
6579366 6584037 makes us the same kind of<br />bullying imperialists
6584121 6586874 that our forefathers<br />were trying to escape.
6587332 6589793 To you, I say...
6589960 6592337 Stop whining!
6594173 6596800 America is now
6596884 6599178 and always will be
6599261 6603682 the greatest country<br />on the face of the Earth!
6608228 6609772 I'm Pat Novak.
6611273 6612524 Good night.
