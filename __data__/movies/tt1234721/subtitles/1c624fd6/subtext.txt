50781 54910 And we're on<br />in four, three,
54994 56912 two, one.
59081 62835 What if I told you that even the<br />worst neighborhood in America
62918 65004 could be made<br />completely safe.
65171 68090 And what if I told you that<br />this could be accomplished
68174 69383 without risking the life
69467 72344 of one single<br />law enforcement officer.
72511 73929 How do I know this?
74013 76223 Because it's happening<br />right now
76307 78601 in every country<br />in the world
78684 80478 but this one.
81061 84523 <i>I'm Pat Novak, and welcome<br />to The Novak Element.</i>
89236 90780 In tonight's<br />State of the Union segment
90863 92907 we'll be joined<br />by General Curtis Monroe
92990 95201 live from the War Room<br />in the Pentagon.
96869 98704 General Monroe,<br />welcome back.
98829 99955 <i>Good to see you, Pat.</i>
100039 104376 Thank you for this unprecedented<br />access to your operations.
104543 108172 Could you walk us through<br />what we're seeing here?
108339 110549 <i>Well, this is<br />a routine operation.</i>
110674 112802 <i>We found that<br />random patrols</i>
112885 116263 <i>helped the local population to<br />feel safer and to trust us.</i>
116347 117348 It's amazing.
117473 119767 And what are<br />these colored dots
119850 121352 that we're seeing here,<br />General?
121519 124438 <i>These are our assets<br />on the ground.</i>
124522 127107 <i>In green,<br />we got the ED-209s.</i>
127191 129902 <i>They're the big boys.<br />They secure the perimeter.</i>
130069 132238 <i>Purple are<br />the smaller EM-208s.</i>
132321 133864 <i>They sweep and mop up.</i>
134031 136909 <i>And the red dots, Pat,<br />that's your film crew.</i>
138661 141121 It is great to see<br />American machines
141205 144500 helping to promote<br />peace and freedom abroad.
144583 146335 <i>All right, you guys, this is<br />a standard op, all right?</i>
146418 147795 <i>There's no<br />opposition expected.</i>
147878 150047 <i>I'm gonna set your markers<br />to code red.</i>
153425 155928 All our drones are gonna give<br />top priority to your safety.
156011 158138 No red assets<br />have ever been lost.
158222 159348 Okay.<br />Okay?
159431 160766 Does that<br />make you feel better?
161058 162768 But, listen,
162852 164603 <i>keep those bracelets on,<br />you're completely safe.</i>
164687 165771 <i>Okay?</i>
165855 167106 <i>Good. Enjoy the show.</i>
173028 175364 All right. Let's go.
180369 182454 <i>May peace<br />be upon you.</i>
183080 186292 <i>Please exit your homes<br />with your arms raised</i>
186375 188878 <i>for a noninvasive<br />scanning procedure.</i>
188961 190963 <i>No one will be harmed.</i>
201140 203559 <i>Please exit your homes<br />with your arms raised</i>
203642 206312 <i>for a noninvasive<br />scanning procedure.</i>
206812 208564 <i>No one will be harmed.</i>
211150 212776 Scott, get me<br />a shot of this.
213485 215529 <i>Your cooperation<br />is appreciated.</i>
215613 218532 <i>We apologize<br />for any inconvenience.</i>
220743 222328 <i>May peace be upon you.</i>
230461 231503 Incredible.
232004 233923 Incredible!
234089 238344 Not long ago, that would have<br />been American men and women
238427 241597 risking their lives<br />to pacify these people.
242681 244892 General, you care<br />to comment on this?
244975 247436 <i>Well, Pat,<br />we had Vietnam,</i>
247519 250314 <i>we had Iraq,<br />we had Afghanistan.</i>
250856 252066 <i>Never again.</i>
252149 255611 <i>From a military perspective,<br />this has been invaluable.</i>
255778 257488 <i>We can accomplish<br />our objectives</i>
257571 259615 <i>without any loss<br />to American lives</i>
259698 263035 <i>and I think the honest people<br />over there really appreciate it.</i>
263410 264954 And why wouldn't they?
265037 267373 For the first time<br />in their lives
267456 269792 they get to watch<br />their children grow up
269875 273754 in an environment<br />of safety and security.
275297 275798 Navid!
275798 277216 Get away from the window!
277549 279385 Mom! They're here! They're coming!
280636 282221 Come here! Come here right now!
282805 283389 Arash!
284640 286433 Navid! You stay with your mom and sisters!
286600 287309 But he's just a kid.
287309 287726 Seven!
288268 289728 Stay here with your mom and the kids!
290354 291939 What do you think you're doing?<br />You heard me!
292189 294566 Arash, please don't go! Don't do this!
297653 298821 Navid! My dear! Come back here!
300489 301031 Navid!
301740 302574 Shut the door!
303993 305577 We're not here to kill any of them.
306495 307079 Got it?
307579 310290 The goal is to die on television.
310833 311291 Let's go!
312584 313585 <i>Kelly!</i>
313711 315337 <i>Can you hear me out there?</i>
315504 318340 <i>Loud and clear, Pat.<br />I'm here in sunny Tehran</i>
318424 322678 where locals have clearly<br />embraced these routine scans.
322761 324722 As you can see behind me,<br />they're working
324805 326598 in collaboration<br />with the robots
326682 331186 and obviously their safety<br />is everyone's top priority.
349079 350622 Don't make a move before I say...
351081 352833 I wanna make sure they're recording.
353417 353792 Yes!
354168 354668 Yes! Yes!
355294 355878 We're ready.
361467 362551 <i>You'll notice children</i>
362634 364678 <i>in the streets as well.<br />This is everyday life</i>
364762 366847 <i>happening in perfect harmony.</i>
372102 373395 <i>Oh, great.<br />Here, come here.</i>
373479 374605 <i>Stay put,<br />stay put, stay put.</i>
374772 376148 It's fine. Don't worry.<br />My guy's got it.
390579 391580 Navid! It's dangerous here!
391663 392414 Come away! Come...
392664 393916 Navid, where are you going?
395459 396877 Look at me! Navid! Navid!
396877 398337 What are you looking for? Navid!
399338 400923 Navid! Navid! What are you...
401381 402382 Navid! Don't go! Navid!
418982 420150 Oh, my God!
427116 428367 <i>Drop your weapon.</i>
433664 434706 <i>Kelly?</i>
434873 436792 Kelly!<br />Are you all right? Kelly!
436959 438043 <i>We're okay, Pat.</i>
438127 440546 <i>Our robots have just repelled<br />some suicide bombers.</i>
440963 442339 I'm sorry, Kelly,
442422 446218 but for security reasons the Pentagon's<br />going to cut our feed to Tehran.
446301 447594 But, please, be careful.
447678 449471 <i>Yeah. I'll continue<br />to stand by.</i>
451890 456478 Now you see how fundamental these<br />robots are to our foreign policy.
457146 458355 So then tell me.
458522 462860 Why can't we use these<br />machines here at home?
463193 467990 Why is America<br />so robophobic?
468907 471910 On the one hand,<br />we have Raymond Sellars.
472828 475998 An entrepreneur<br />and true American
476081 479251 whose product just saved<br />my colleague's life.
479543 481628 And on the other.
481712 484131 Hubert Dreyfus.
484214 488260 A man with both feet<br />planted firmly in the past
488510 492723 whose bill prohibits the<br />use of drones on US soil.
492890 495934 The American people<br />support the Dreyfus Act
496101 499563 because they haven't<br />experienced this technology
499730 502774 and they fear<br />what they don't understand.
503400 506778 <i>We at The Novak Element<br />support Mr. Sellars' efforts</i>
507112 510199 to make our country<br />and our viewers safer.
510365 512284 After all,
512367 516413 what's more important than the<br />safety of the American people?
543649 545275 Hey, Murphy.<br />Hey.
547486 548904 How's Jack?
549321 550781 We don't know yet.
551281 552991 Murphy-<br />Hey.
553158 554993 How's it going?<br />Good.
560749 562042 What the hell<br />are they doing here?
562125 565045 Six in the morgue.<br />Lewis in the hospital.
565128 567047 This was the mother<br />of all bad ideas.
567130 569091 We got a lead on Antoine<br />Vallon, we took it.
569174 570175 What lead?
571134 572427 Not in front of them.
572928 574846 This is bullshit. Yeah?
575013 576598 Yeah, you got something<br />to say, Murphy?
576682 577766 Vallon's our case.
577849 581687 Yeah, two years without no arrest, no<br />nothing? You've gotta be dumb or dirty.
582688 585107 You got something on us?<br />Or is this personal?
585315 587192 No, it's nothing personal.
587609 589444 Although, I don't<br />like you as a person.
589695 591530 Okay, you two, out.
591697 593115 No problem.
594533 595951 Maybe if you hadn't<br />gone off the reservation,
596034 597577 your partner would<br />still be standing.
597703 599496 - What'd you say to me?<br />- Hey, that's enough!
602666 603875 Okay, Alex.
606670 608463 It's just you and me now.
609214 611550 So me and Jack, we've been<br />doin' some street buys.
611717 613218 We get a line on some guns.
613969 616888 <i>We meet up with this<br />low-level G called Jerry</i>
617055 619516 <i>who ends up havin' a piece<br />he's not supposed to have.</i>
619683 621476 Where the hell you get a<br />gun like that, Jerry?
621643 623478 I can get you two<br />whole crates full, man.
623645 624646 Two crates?
624813 625814 No disrespect, J,
625897 627733 but how a clown like you<br />get so much product, man?
627899 629067 What's it matter<br />where it comes from?
629234 631820 Why it matters, we don't<br />want no dirty guns, Jerry.
631987 633739 These guns got bodies<br />on 'em, Jerry?
633905 635073 Yo, look,<br />they're clean, all right?
635157 636616 You gonna buy<br />this shit or not?
636700 638160 Why you acting<br />so nervous, man?
638243 640078 You fishin' on us, Jerry?
640162 641246 What'd you say?
641371 643332 You think he fishin', D?<br />I think he's fishin' on us.
643415 644833 Yo, what the hell<br />are they talkin' about, man?
644916 646251 Hey, let me see your phone.
646752 647753 Let me see your phone.
647836 649046 I'm not showing you<br />my phone, man!
649129 650380 You recordin' this?
650672 652132 I think you're<br />a goddamn cop!
652215 653216 What the hell are<br />you talkin' about, man?
653300 654593 I'm not showing you<br />my phone!
654718 655761 Hey! Put your gun down!
655844 657054 Put your phones<br />on the table.
657137 659056 We're not cops, all right?<br />We work for Antoine Vallon.
659264 660265 What?
660432 662225 Shut up! Shut up!<br />What'd you say?
662601 664394 Ends up he works<br />for Vallon.
664561 667356 Before the meet, we ran the<br />serial numbers on the rifles.
667522 669691 The guns were supposed to be<br />in our evidence room.
670942 672444 <i>Not out on the street.</i>
672611 674696 <i>Intake papers blank.<br />No signatures.</i>
674863 677115 What do you got?<br />Nothin'.
677949 679785 How do you think<br />that happened?
681703 683705 I'm telling you, Murphy,<br />this is a mistake.
683872 686792 These guys'll shoot you just<br />to see if they gun work.
687209 688251 We need backup.
688418 690712 If we call for backup, word's<br />gonna get around the station.
690796 692130 He's gonna disappear.
692464 693965 It's gonna be all right.
694800 697052 <i>MURPHY". So we told Vallon<br />we were gun buyers,</i>
697219 698387 <i>and he bought it.</i>
698553 702474 What do you two need with that<br />much product? You plotting a coup?
703475 705811 Man, don't trip, we ain't gonna<br />bust a single shot in your town.
705977 707896 We got some problems<br />back home with Chicago PD.
709314 711024 Yeah, I heard<br />you don't like cops.
711608 712984 Hey, boss.
714486 715987 What do you got for me?
717781 718782 Really?
718990 721660 <i>We were just about to close<br />the deal but someone tipped him off.</i>
721827 724246 Gentlemen,<br />I gotta deal with this.
724413 725831 Two minutes.
732921 734339 Make sure<br />you kill 'em both!
743306 746101 I got two handguns,<br />one automatic.
758780 761032 We gotta get out of here.<br />I'm gonna take the automatic.
761199 762492 You sure about this?
784848 785849 You ready?
786141 787142 Move.
827682 828850 Lewis!
829768 830894 Lewis!
833772 837442 Officer down!<br />Officer down, 331 Hamilton.
837609 839069 This is Detective Alex Murphy
839152 841071 in need of immediate<br />medical assistance.
841238 843240 331 Hamilton Road.
844241 845283 Jack.
846284 849246 Jack, come on.<br />Jack. Can you hear me?
849788 851748 Jack. Stay with me.
852707 853792 Jack.
854376 857629 <i>Alex, you don't<br />do something like this</i>
857796 859464 unless you bring it<br />to me first.
859631 860966 Vallon's connected.
861132 864928 I'm warning you, don't make any<br />more moves until I vet this.
865095 866805 If officers are<br />supplying him with guns...
866888 868974 That's up to IAD.
869432 870934 I'll handle it.
876606 881278 I don't care how sophisticated<br />these machines are, Mr. Sellars.
881486 885991 A machine does not know what<br />it feels like to be human.
886157 888535 It can't understand<br />the value of human life.
888618 890120 Why should it be<br />allowed to take one?
891329 894708 To legislate<br />over life and death,
894791 898587 we need people who<br />understand right from wrong.
898920 901006 What do your machines feel?
901172 904634 Well, they feel no anger.<br />They feel no prejudice.
904801 909347 They feel no fatigue, which makes<br />them ideal for law enforcement.
910348 913518 Putting these machines<br />on the streets
913685 916688 will save countless<br />American lives.
916855 918690 You're evading the question.<br />No, I'm not.
918857 919899 Yes,<br />you're evading the question.
919983 923445 I asked what do<br />these machines feel?
923612 926448 If one of them<br />killed a child,
927532 928992 what would it feel?
932621 934497 Nothing.<br />And that's the problem.
934664 939961 That's why 72% of Americans will not<br />stand for a robot pulling the trigger.
946801 950930 America is the world's most<br />valuable market, and we can't touch it.
951222 956519 With a domestic expansion, we'd<br />clear $600 billion per annum.
956686 961566 In other words, every second that law is<br />in existence, we are hemorrhaging money.
961733 962734 What do you<br />want me to do?
962901 966237 We've thrown cash at senators at both<br />sides of the aisle. Nobody's budging.
966404 968323 They don't want to vote<br />against their constituents.
968490 971534 So unless we sway public<br />opinion, the battle's lost.
971701 973662 Now, to that effect,
973828 978083 my team have come up with a<br />pretty aggressive new campaign.
978249 980752 Wow factor<br />off-the-charts.
980919 983755 We need to give Americans<br />a product they can love.
984089 985757 A figure<br />they can rally behind.
985924 988927 Sir, I have dissected this bill.<br />There are no loopholes.
989094 990762 We can't put a machine<br />on the streets.
990845 992055 Forget machines.
992222 993598 You saw the polls.
994057 996267 Americans don't<br />want a machine.
997519 999104 They want
999187 1001940 a product<br />with a conscience.
1002565 1004526 They want
1004609 1007487 something that knows
1008530 1011032 what it feels like
1011116 1012575 to be human.
1019124 1021459 We're gonna put a man<br />inside a machine.
1025255 1029092 You're not you because<br />of your legs, your arms, your hands.
1029175 1030844 You're you because<br />of your brain.
1030927 1035348 It's your brain's capacity to process<br />information that makes you who you are.
1036725 1040979 Relax, and just do<br />what you've always done.
1044774 1046609 I've never played<br />with these.
1046818 1051114 The music doesn't come from your fingers,<br />Michael, it comes from your mind.
1051281 1053241 All you have to do<br />is let it out.
1054200 1055326 Please.
1086191 1087650 Oh, my God.
1091988 1093573 No, it's okay. Easy.
1095700 1098328 His emotions are peaking. The<br />readings are getting clouded.
1098661 1099662 It's okay.
1100288 1102665 Relax. If you get<br />too emotional,
1102749 1104626 it'll change the chemistry<br />in your brain.
1104793 1106544 It'll throw the system out.
1109631 1112133 You're doing great.<br />Come on.
1126815 1128733 I need emotion to play.
1129567 1131694 Concierto <i>de<br /></i> Aranjuez, second movement.
1133071 1134572 Beautiful piece.
1134656 1137450 <i>Bennett, when you<br />have a moment. Thank you.</i>
1137700 1140703 Now, we agreed on this<br />a long time ago, Raymond.
1140787 1144499 I wouldn't be asked to<br />develop combat applications.
1144666 1147836 My work here is driven<br />by its own questions.
1147919 1151464 And your work is brilliant. But<br />your ideas are being underutilized.
1151548 1154300 Look, I think<br />I found a way
1154384 1158137 to put real revenue stream<br />behind your research
1158805 1161891 and save thousands<br />of lives in the process.
1174737 1176114 You're not<br />keeping up your end,
1176197 1177532 leaving me exposed<br />like that.
1177699 1179492 Detective Murphy's<br />just a little impulsive.
1179659 1180743 So put him<br />on the payroll.
1180827 1181828 Why are we talkin'<br />about this?
1181995 1183538 It won't work. And now that<br />his partner got hit,
1183621 1185540 he's never gonna let it go.
1185707 1187584 What is that?<br />Lewis' hospital.
1187750 1189043 Alex is dropping by<br />this afternoon,
1189127 1191212 in case you want<br />to send flowers.
1195508 1196634 Yeah.
1196801 1198177 I kill a cop,
1198261 1199929 lookin' over my shoulder<br />the rest of my life.
1200013 1201347 That's not good<br />for business.
1202140 1204434 Who do you think's<br />gonna be investigating you?
1210607 1212942 I'm gonna go hard<br />after Lake and Daniels.
1215153 1217655 I'm gonna have 'em in bracelets<br />within a month, man.
1219490 1221117 Hey, Vallon,<br />I'm walking up right now.
1222285 1223703 Cameras off?
1225079 1226080 Clear.
1227373 1230960 <i>You were right.<br />We should've had backup.</i>
1231127 1232503 <i>I'm sorry.</i>
1236007 1237842 You're not really sleeping,<br />are ya?
1240470 1241596 Asshole.
1243973 1248770 Sergeant Thomas Ryan, NYPD.<br />Paralyzed from the waist down.

1253399 1254525 Pass.
1254692 1256152 Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.
1256694 1259155 Officer Alfred Miller,<br />Denver.

1262951 1264535 Cerebellar ataxia.
1264786 1266287 That's why you're<br />the doctor, Doctor.
1266871 1270541 He scored through the roof<br />with our urban demos.
1270625 1272210 Let's keep this one<br />in mind. I like this guy.
1272460 1275171 Very good, sir.<br />I saved the best for last.
1276714 1280802 I give you Sergeant Jack<br />Freeman, masculinity incarnate.
1280885 1283262 Led Pittsburgh SWAT<br />for five years,
1283346 1285431 now confined<br />to a wheelchair.
1287850 1289978 I think I can<br />see the appeal.
1290061 1291062 NO.
1291145 1293022 What? Why?
1293189 1296109 Well,check the psych evaluation.<br />He's far too unstable.
1296275 1298069 He's trying to say<br />that he has a temper.
1298361 1300738 Have you any idea<br />what we'd be putting him through?
1300905 1304158 The psychological strain requires<br />someone emotionally balanced.
1304325 1306369 We have to be scientific.
1306536 1309247 I mean, we're not selling<br />a soft drink here, are we?
1309414 1312125 He's right. Okay.<br />Keep looking.
1314043 1316963 David, what did I say?<br />Not until you're finished.
1317130 1319132 Hey, guys.<br />Hi, Dad.
1319507 1322093 Hey.<br />Hey, little monkey.
1326347 1327557 How's the game, buddy?
1327724 1330601 Damon got ejected, but we<br />got a two-man advantage.
1330768 1333604 Oh, yeah?<br />That's fantastic.
1333688 1335231 Hey, D, why don't<br />you head upstairs
1335314 1336983 and start getting ready<br />for bed.
1337233 1338818 But he just got home.
1339444 1340903 I'll be up in a second.
1340987 1343448 Tuck you in, okay?<br />All right?
1347285 1349203 Now give your mom a kiss.<br />Good night, baby.
1349370 1350580 Too slow, boy.
1352623 1354167 You're just too slow.
1362091 1363259 How's Jack holding up?
1363426 1365887 They said a week<br />till he's back on his feet.
1366763 1367722 It's my fault.
1367805 1369182 We shouldn't even<br />have been there.
1371851 1372852 Here.
1437166 1438960 Oh, shit, I thought<br />I fixed that.
1439127 1440419 It'll stop.
1446717 1448469 It's gonna<br />wake up David.
1492221 1496726 <i>He suffered 4th degree<br />burns over 80% of his body.</i>
1497310 1499729 <i>Lower spine<br />has been severed.</i>
1500688 1502607 <i>If he survives,</i>
1503399 1507278 he'll be paralyzed from the waist<br />down and confined to a wheelchair.
1510031 1511741 Mrs. Murphy,
1513492 1515828 we don't have to do this.
1517163 1520208 I need to know everything<br />before I make a decision.
1523502 1524962 Please continue.
1525963 1528090 Vestibulocochlear,
1528174 1531260 optical nerves have<br />been critically damaged.
1532303 1534430 He'll be blind in one eye.
1535056 1536515 Most likely deaf.
1537558 1539727 Frankly, Dr. Norton<br />and the Omni Foundation
1539810 1541312 are the leaders<br />in this field.
1541479 1545066 In my opinion, this is the<br />only chance your husband has.
1545233 1547610 I'd seriously<br />consider their offer.
1550404 1551697 I'm sorry, Doctor.
1553282 1554700 I need time to think.
1554867 1558788 I'm afraid, Mrs. Murphy, time<br />is one thing you don't have.
1562833 1565670 You say you can save him,<br />but what does that mean?
1568923 1570883 What kind of life<br />will he have?
1580518 1582770 <i>Fly</i> me to the <i>moon</i>
1583437 1587149 <i>Let me play<br />among the stars</i>
1587858 1590236 Thanks.<br />Thanks, buddy.
1590403 1592196 You know she's gonna<br />make me dance again.
1592321 1594031 Now that I've gotta see.
1594198 1595199 You don't want<br />to see that.
1595283 1596951 Here she comes now.
1597118 1598244 Hold on to that.
1598327 1599578 Get out there, partner.
1601122 1602873 Every time.
1606711 1607795 Get her, boy.

1629567 1631152 He's retrieving memories,
1631235 1634655 trying to make sense of sensorial<br />stimulation package 37.
1635656 1637199 Perfect, Kim.
1638701 1640703 Let's reconnect the spine.
1641704 1643205 Time to wake him up.
1646876 1649837 <i>Fill my heart with song</i>

1695549 1696842 What's happening?
1699261 1700262 Where am I?
1700429 1704934 You were in an explosion, Alex.<br />You're in a hospital.
1707353 1709855 Where's Clara? My wife.<br />Where's my wife?
1710022 1712358 I want you to calm down,<br />Alex. Listen to me.
1712525 1716112 You're okay. And your family's fine.<br />Both your wife and your son.
1716987 1718406 Who the hell are you?
1718823 1721575 I'm Dr. Dennett Norton.<br />I'm treating you.

1747977 1750980 Unlock upper,<br />lower extremities.
1763659 1765744 What kind of suit is this?
1765911 1769415 It's not a suit, Alex.
1771542 1772793 It's you.
1774712 1776380 This was the only option.
1776547 1780050 We're here, all of us,<br />to make you whole again.

1782094 1784472 I want you<br />to walk now, Alex.
1784555 1786140 You can do that.
1809914 1811665 This seems so real.
1814585 1816462 Alex,<br />it's very important
1816545 1818130 you understand<br />what is happening.
1818297 1819590 This is real.
1819673 1822843 It's not a dream, it's not<br />drugs or anesthetics.
1823010 1825846 I know I'm dreaming 'cause<br />I can feel all of this.
1825930 1828974 Alex, amputees can often feel<br />their missing appendages.
1829141 1830351 It's called<br />phantom limb sensation.
1830434 1831685 What do you mean "amputees"?
1832144 1834021 What the hell did you do to me?<br />You need to relax.
1834188 1835481 Take this off me now.
1835648 1838108 I need to get out of this thing.<br />What did you do to me?
1838484 1840236 What have you done to me?
1840861 1842738 Alex? Hey!
1844114 1845115 Shut him down.
1845282 1847826 No! Let him run!<br />Let him run!

1947760 1949178 Okay, Kim.
1950471 1951805 Shut him down.
1977748 1979249 Alex,
1979958 1981794 you can't run from this.
1983796 1987966 You have to understand<br />the reality of the situation.
1991595 1992805 Show me.
1994973 1996183 Kim.
2012241 2013409 Oh!

2027131 2029466 Holy Christ,<br />there's nothing left.
2035597 2039268 Your body may have gone,<br />but you're still here.
2045733 2047443 That's not even my brain.
2047609 2050738 We had to repair<br />the damaged areas.
2050904 2054032 But we didn't interfere with<br />your emotion or your intellect.
2054450 2056660 Do you understand me, Alex?
2057369 2060122 You're in control.
2060956 2063375 I'm in control?<br />Yes.
2066128 2067421 Okay.
2070591 2072926 If I'm in control,
2074303 2076054 then I wanna die.
2077556 2082811 Just unplug whatever it is keepin'<br />me alive and end this nightmare.
2083353 2085189 Now, say I did that.
2085355 2087900 Which as a doctor would<br />almost be impossible for me,
2087983 2089985 but say I did.
2091862 2094114 What do I say<br />to your wife?
2094698 2096325 What does she say<br />to your son?
2096492 2099161 That it didn't work.<br />That you tried.
2100162 2101872 Somethin' went wrong.
2102748 2105751 You did everything<br />you could,
2108545 2110047 but I died.
2110214 2112049 So after all<br />they've been through,
2112132 2115469 all the pain,<br />all their hope restored,
2115761 2117763 we would just<br />rip that away?
2119348 2121350 Your wife<br />loves you, Alex.
2121725 2123602 She signed<br />the consent forms herself.
2123685 2127022 Otherwise, you couldn't have<br />undergone the procedure.
2137199 2141829 She loves you and she<br />gave you a second chance.
2144081 2146625 I need you to take it.
2151004 2153590 I don't wanna see myself<br />like this again.
2155175 2156218 Even
2156385 2158554 And the same goes<br />for my family.

2203056 2204516 I'm sorry.
2205475 2207853 I know how I must<br />look to you.
2208020 2210355 <i>I think you look beautiful.</i>
2214234 2216153 <i>Are they treating you okay,<br />baby?</i>
2216320 2220741 So far. Dr. Norton,<br />he seems like a nice guy.
2222200 2224244 Does David know<br />you're calling?
2227706 2229291 <i>He misses you.</i>
2230042 2232169 <i>I can go get him.<br />No.</i>
2233503 2235714 I don't want him<br />to see me like this.
2237883 2238967 Not yet.
2239259 2240344 <i>Sure.</i>
2246224 2248727 <i>We're gonna<br />get through this, baby.</i>
2251438 2253815 <i>We're gonna make it<br />like it was.</i>
2258362 2259863 <i>When are you comin' home?</i>
2260030 2262366 Well, they've still<br />got some tests.
2263450 2265577 But they're sayin'<br />it's goin' really well.
2267496 2268997 The minute they let me.
2271416 2272960 I gotta go.
2274086 2275379 I love you.

2333812 2336148 Let's give him a nice dream.
2347284 2348785 All right, here's<br />what you're dealin' with.
2349036 2351580 Modified M2 battle rifle.
2351747 2354124 .50 caliber Beowulf<br />ammunition at 30 round clips.
2354249 2356043 Three-shot bursts<br />or full auto.
2357377 2358420 Heavy-duty.
2359755 2362883 TSR 66. Cartridge-driven<br />taser pistol.
2363050 2367387 Each projectile releases up to 200,000<br />volts. It can stun, it can kill
2367554 2368930 and it's nasty shit.
2369306 2370348 Your armor,
2370432 2371767 state-of-the-art,<br />but not invulnerable.
2371933 2374478 .50 caliber or larger<br />can penetrate and kill.
2374644 2378356 Multiple hits, and guess who<br />ends up in the recycling bin?
2380692 2382569 If you sense you need a<br />weapon or are threatened
2384571 2387699 the visor goes down and the system<br />makes the weapons available.
2387866 2390744 But you gotta remember, it's<br />not the weapons that count.
2390827 2391870 It's who's handling them.
2391953 2394164 Or, in your case, what.
2394581 2397084 You think you can do this?<br />Oh, just stick to your job.
2397209 2400045 Just stick to my job?<br />Combat robots are my job, Doc.
2400212 2404299 Rio, Congo, you name it, I was there.<br />Our machines run perfectly.
2404466 2406510 You ask me, stickin'<br />organics into the system
2406593 2408678 is a huge step backwards.
2409137 2411056 I don't care how well you<br />designed this thing.
2411223 2413517 Without my sign-off, it better<br />start learnin' Chinese,
2413600 2415060 'cause it ain't<br />never goin' home.
2422609 2424486 It's nice to meet you, too.
2425904 2427489 Let's do this,
2427823 2429116 Tin Man.
2435455 2439459 Quality control,<br />EM-208 versus Tin Man.
2439626 2442546 Rendering scenario one now.
2443380 2445006 Hey,Doc,<br />hope you don't mind.
2445090 2446216 I like a little music<br />while I'm workin'.
2447634 2450262 <i>When a man's an empty kettle</i>
2450428 2455392 All right. All right, let's let the<br />games begin. Let's rock 'n' roll.
2457310 2458562 Commence scenario.
2458728 2461731 <i>Just because I'm presumin'<br />That I could be kind of human</i>
2461898 2465110 <i>If I only had a heart</i>
2466236 2471158 <i>I'd be tender, I'd be gentle<br />And awful sentimental</i>
2471324 2473785 <i>Regarding love and art</i>
2475162 2477622 <i>I'd be friends<br />with the sparrows</i>
2477706 2479791 <i>And the boy<br />who shoots the arrows</i>
2479958 2482836 <i>If I only had a heart</i>
2484754 2488425 <i>Picture me a balcony</i>
2489467 2492429 <i>Above a voice sings low...</i>
2492637 2494389 <i>Laggin' on the comers.</i>
2494472 2495974 No, there,<br />d'you see that?
2496057 2497934 What my robot did,<br />that's how you do it.
2500270 2501479 New product's afraid.
2502355 2505692 2.3 seconds behind. Great.
2507277 2508570 <i>Don't shoot! He has a gun!</i>
2508653 2509696 <i>Drop your gun!</i>
2512157 2513158 <i>Drop your gun!</i>
2514117 2515619 <i>Drop the weapon.<br />Let the kid go!</i>
2515785 2518955 Oh, well, it's worried that<br />the kid's gonna get hurt.
2519122 2520624 <i>- Let the kid go!<br />- Too bad.</i>
2522167 2526129 Well, there you have it. 5.6<br />seconds behind. Scenario failure.
2526296 2528173 I wouldn't buy that<br />for a dollar.
2533637 2536056 Let's do it again.<br />Your funeral.
2539851 2540936 Detective Alex Murphy.
2541102 2542312 <i>Search results.</i>
2542395 2544439 <i>"Detective Murphy<br />making a speedy recovery."</i>
2544606 2546733 <i>"Alex Murphy.<br />Man or Machine?"</i>
2546900 2550278 <i>"Thrust into the spotlight,<br />Clara Murphy won't talk."</i>
2551321 2552906 Antoine Vallon.
2552989 2554074 <i>Search results.</i>
2554157 2558286 <i>"DPD says Antoine Val/on no longer<br />suspect due to lack of evidence."</i>
2561831 2563708 <i>Detroit Free Press.</i>
2563875 2566962 <i>Unfortunately, Murphy's<br />investigation into Antoine Vallon</i>
2567045 2568463 <i>wasn't authorized<br />in the first place.</i>
2568546 2572259 <i>Look, Detective Murphy was<br />simply overzealous, okay?</i>
2572342 2575470 <i>We have absolutely no evidence linking<br />Vallon to the attempt on his life.</i>
2575553 2577847 <i>All I'm gonna say is<br />my partner's a great cop.</i>
2577931 2581434 <i>And I won't rest until the men who tried<br />to kill him are brought to justice.</i>
2585313 2586314 What's wrong with him?
2586398 2587482 No, nothing, nothing.
2588650 2592070 Watch the procedural bars<br />on the 208.
2592946 2596449 The machine assesses<br />the threat and acts.
2597075 2598451 That's it.
2598952 2601329 It's two steps.<br />Now watch Alex.
2602372 2606459 The software assesses the<br />threat, just like the robot.
2606626 2608503 And it sends the information<br />to the brain.
2608670 2611423 Alex's brain receives the information<br />and decides what to do with it
2611506 2616136 based on his emotional cognitive<br />abilities like any man would.
2616303 2619472 Then the brain relates this<br />to the Al module and...
2619639 2622350 Yeah, like, you know,<br />a year later.
2622434 2623643 And our computers<br />finish the job.
2623768 2627480 Raymond, you wanted<br />a man inside a machine.
2627564 2629149 And that's what you've got.
2629232 2631359 But the human element<br />will always be present.
2631443 2634029 Fear, instinct,<br />bias, compassion,
2634112 2635363 they will always interfere<br />with the system!
2635447 2636990 Okay, but, Dennett,
2637073 2640493 I've gotta give the American people<br />something they can root for.
2640577 2642329 Something aspirational, right?
2642412 2643830 They have to<br />believe in this thing.
2643997 2647417 "Pretty good"? I don't<br />know how to sell "okay."
2647500 2649127 We, you and I,<br />have got a release date,
2649210 2650628 and we've gotta<br />make it, okay?
2650712 2653298 So I don't care how you do it. I'm<br />askin' ya, come on, can you help me?
2653381 2656843 Just get him to do that.<br />Get him to do that.
2656926 2658345 That is a machine.
2658428 2659888 I know, but it's a man<br />inside a machine.
2659971 2662849 No, that's a man<br />inside a machine right there!
2662932 2664017 And his life depends on it.
2664100 2665477 And the future of Omnicorp<br />depends on it
2665560 2668396 so get your ass back to China<br />and get it fixed.
2668480 2670648 I don't care how you do it,<br />just go do it!
2686122 2689209 It tastes like<br />peanut butter.
2693171 2695340 I can't get it<br />out of my mouth.
2696049 2697801 And you<br />don't like peanut butter?
2697967 2699177 No.
2699928 2701513 You like peanut butter, Kim?
2701679 2703098 I love it.
2704808 2706226 Okay.
2707268 2708853 I'm gonna put you<br />to sleep now, Alex.
2708937 2710021 Okay.
2711272 2713274 Now, put him under, Kim.
2718655 2720365 What are you planning to do?
2721324 2725245 Consciousness<br />is nothing more
2725412 2728123 than the processing<br />of information.
2729666 2731501 I'm gonna fix him.
2732919 2735004 And he won't<br />know the difference.
2746349 2747934 Raymond?<br />Yeah?
2748017 2751479 We just ran focus groups<br />at Ryan Correctional Facility.
2752355 2755442 We call this Combat Mode.
2755608 2758319 It really put the fear of God<br />into the prisoners.
2758486 2759612 Yeah, that's okay.
2759779 2761531 And get a load of this.
2762282 2766119 What's that? He transforms.<br />Kids love it.
2766453 2768788 Really? Focus group<br />numbers through the roof.
2768955 2770290 Really?<br />Oh, yeah.
2770457 2772417 Well, that's really<br />embarrassing.
2772584 2774544 What is this?<br />You know what?
2774711 2776546 People really don't know<br />what they want
2776629 2778840 until you show it to 'em<br />most of the time.
2779674 2781926 Make him more, uh,
2782010 2783011 tactical.
2783094 2784637 Make him look, uh...
2786806 2788558 Let's go with black.
2789851 2791060 Yeah.
2826221 2827222 Alex.
2827388 2829474 He looks<br />like a billion dollars.
2829641 2831601 2.6 billion.
2832060 2833770 Raymond Sellars.
2834103 2835980 I've looked forward to<br />meeting you, Detective.
2836064 2838149 I really appreciate everything<br />you've done for me.
2838233 2840443 Well, we funded<br />this program
2840527 2842737 to give men like you<br />a second chance.
2843571 2845365 You just do<br />your best today.
2845740 2846991 Shall we?<br />Let's.
2850119 2852580 Mr. Sellars, we're ready for you.<br />Okay, great.
2852747 2854207 Chief Technician Shuman.
2854374 2855750 Mornin', folks.
2858878 2861089 <i>Okay, so<br />this is how it's gonna be.</i>
2861256 2863550 We're goin' toe-to-toe.<br />Last man standing wins.
2864050 2866261 <i>I hit you, you go back<br />to the drawing board.</i>
2866344 2868846 <i>You hit me,<br />you get a ticket back home.</i>
2870014 2872684 My guys are gonna be<br />shootin' .47 caliber rounds.
2872850 2875019 Do a little damage,<br />but they can't take you out.
2875186 2878523 But make no mistake,<br />Tin Man, my gun will.
2893955 2895123 Alex, listen to me.
2895665 2897917 <i>The EM-208s will<br />try to maneuver you</i>
2898001 2899335 <i>so Mattox can<br />get a clear shot.</i>
2900044 2902547 <i>Do not let that happen.</i>
2902672 2906009 <i>If Mattox hits you, everything but<br />your life support will shut down.</i>
2906092 2909220 <i>You'll feel more pain than<br />you've ever felt in your life.</i>
2909554 2912223 I don't know about that.<br />I've been through a lot.
2918271 2919480 All right.
2920315 2922191 I say we go on three.
2922358 2923359 Three.
2945340 2946924 How's it going down there?
2949052 2952055 Whatever you do,<br />don't get shot in the face.
2955558 2956559 Wow.
2988758 2991552 Dr. Norton,<br />how is he doing this?
2992345 2995848 His software is faster.<br />His hardware is stronger.
2996015 2997517 <i>He's a better machine.</i>
3000144 3002355 <i>But you said<br />humans hesitate.</i>
3002522 3004816 Only when they're<br />making decisions.
3004899 3006859 He's not<br />making decisions?
3007026 3008778 Yes and no.
3009153 3012073 In his everyday life,<br />man rules over the machine.
3012156 3014200 Alex makes his own decisions.
3014575 3016411 <i>Now, when he<br />engages in battle,</i>
3016494 3019706 <i>the visor comes down<br />and the software takes over.</i>
3019872 3021833 <i>Then the machine<br />does everything.</i>
3021916 3025253 Alex is a passenger,<br />just along for the ride.
3028798 3030174 <i>But if the machine<br />is in control,</i>
3030258 3031676 <i>then how is Murphy<br />accountable?</i>
3031884 3032885 Who's pulling the trigger?
3032969 3034345 Well, when<br />the machine fights,
3034429 3036931 the system releases signals<br />into Alex's brain
3037014 3039600 making him think he's doing what<br />our computers are actually doing.
3039684 3042520 I mean, Alex believes right<br />now he is in control.
3042603 3046065 But he's not. It's the<br />illusion of free will.
3055783 3056868 Crap!
3079223 3082143 So you've circumvented the law by creating<br />a machine that thinks it's a man.
3082226 3083227 But that's illegal.
3083394 3085188 No. No, no, no.
3086314 3088691 It's a machine that thinks<br />it's Alex Murphy.
3088858 3090151 And in my book
3090651 3092111 that's legal.
3094071 3095239 Well done.
3096783 3098284 Well done.
3101662 3106125 Hey, Doctor, what happens if I tase an<br />exoskeleton with a little asshole inside?
3107210 3110505 I, uh, I think we're all<br />curious to find out.
3110671 3112006 Go ahead.
3149085 3151420 If I had a pulse,<br />it'd be racing.
3152088 3154257 She's been waiting<br />four months.
3154674 3156592 I'm sure hers is, too.
3159011 3160763 You're gonna do fine.
3170439 3172400 I love your sign, D.
3175736 3176863 Hey.
3181242 3182952 There's nothin' to be<br />nervous about.
3187707 3188875 <i>Thank you, Bennett.</i>
3189750 3191377 It's been a privilege.
3286180 3287223 Hi, Dad.
3290184 3291894 You know<br />I missed you, buddy.
3292895 3294230 Me, too.
3301404 3302863 Wanna feel it?
3306742 3308035 What is it?
3309412 3310913 It's okay, sweetie.
3322383 3325177 I saved all the Red Wings<br />games on my computer.
3326220 3327596 You did?
3330599 3332560 How'd they do?<br />I don't know.
3332727 3334937 I've been waiting<br />to watch them with you.
3336355 3338190 You know I'd love to, kiddo.
3339025 3340609 But I can't tonight.
3341277 3343612 You know, 'cause Daddy's<br />suit needs some...
3344780 3346574 Some special handling.
3348200 3349618 Do you understand?
3381025 3382234 Thanks for coming, Jack.
3382485 3383986 I heard you<br />went home already.
3384070 3385821 I know Clara must be<br />thrilled to have you back.
3385905 3388157 I saw Clara
3388240 3389492 and David.
3392286 3394497 That ain't my home right now.
3395831 3397917 It's in a damn lab<br />across the hall.
3398084 3399794 I'm sorry, Alex.
3400169 3404006 Startin' tomorrow, I'm gonna take<br />down Vallon and his whole damn crew.
3404090 3405966 I was waitin'<br />to hear you say that.
3410179 3412264 Least I know<br />you're the right color now.
3445047 3447341 <i>Pat, the cooler<br />temperatures here today</i>
3447424 3449593 <i>certainly have not stopped<br />people from showing up.</i>
3449677 3452138 <i>We're expecting people<br />from every corner of the city</i>
3452221 3453472 <i>here in Detroit</i>
3453556 3455432 <i>to come out and<br />show their support</i>
3455516 3456767 <i>for Detective Alex Murphy.</i>
3456851 3460396 <i>You know, a lot of questions on people's<br />minds today is what will he look like.</i>
3460688 3462314 <i>Is he a changed man?</i>
3462481 3464150 <i>Rumor has it<br />he is in the building</i>
3464233 3465734 <i>preparing to come out...</i>
3466527 3471866 Alex, we're gonna upload the entire<br />DPD database into your brain.
3472575 3476829 That means you'll have instantaneous<br />access to criminal records
3476912 3481083 plus an archive of CCTV footage<br />from 2011 to the present.
3481250 3482251 All right.
3483210 3484378 Hit me.
3485004 3487256 Okay. Kim,<br />it's all yours.
3488924 3491510 Archive footage<br />uploading successfully.
3491677 3494263 Your system draws<br />connections automatically.
3494346 3496182 It will link perpetrators<br />to their crimes
3496265 3499602 and give you their exact<br />locations whenever available.
3500227 3503439 I got evidence<br />to make 138... No, no.
3503772 3505941 166 arrests.
3506692 3508652 His emotions are stable.
3510279 3511864 This is incredible.
3512406 3515034 <i>You will notice his family<br />is here in the building as well.</i>
3515117 3517203 <i>The mayor is standing<br />onstage behind me.</i>
3517286 3519455 <i>Also, Raymond Sellars<br />from Omnicorp.</i>
3519538 3520789 <i>They seem like great friends</i>
3520873 3523792 <i>obviously echoing the partnership<br />that they've brought together.</i>
3525044 3526378 How much longer<br />will this take?
3526462 3529548 Well, the feed from the<br />database is almost done, so.
3529715 3531300 We're approaching<br />present day.
3531383 3534887 634 pending arrests.
3534970 3537389 We're gonna need<br />a bigger prison.
3539808 3540976 He's on top of her.
3541060 3542895 Dr. Norton,<br />he's getting too emotional.
3542978 3544563 I gotta do something!<br />Alex.
3544647 3546815 Alex, calm down.
3547316 3548734 Take a breath.
3548984 3550402 Relax.
3550653 3551904 Kim, what are the readings?
3551987 3553781 I haven't seen him<br />at levels like this.
3553948 3555032 - He's gonna shoot 'em!<br />- Alex!
3555282 3557534 Alex, Alex, relax.
3558494 3559495 Relax.
3560496 3561497 Alex?
3562164 3564166 What is this?<br />This just a computer glitch?
3564333 3566085 No. That's<br />his own crime scene.
3566168 3567169 Alex!
3567253 3568254 He's spiking<br />all over the place.
3568337 3569505 Alex!
3570172 3571924 The system<br />is crashing, Doctor.
3572091 3573175 Alex, can you hear me?
3573759 3574760 Alex! Alex!
3574927 3577096 I'm not sure he can handle this.<br />I gotta do something!
3577179 3578180 He's emotionally overloaded.
3578430 3579431 Unlock me!
3579598 3581016 Alex! Stop!
3581517 3583143 Stop! He's having a seizure!
3583310 3585187 Kim, shut him down! Alex!
3585521 3586522 Get me a live feed!
3586605 3587773 I can't do it.<br />Dr. Norton's with the patient.
3587856 3588857 Do it now!
3589024 3590150 Jesus Christ!
3590317 3591944 Dr. Norton! Dr. Norton!
3592111 3593487 What?<br />The press is waiting!
3593654 3594655 We have to<br />get him up there now!
3594738 3595864 What do you<br />want me to do?
3595948 3598826 I don't know! Fix him!<br />Do what you have to do!
3598909 3602246 Your reputation is on the line<br />every bit as much as ours.
3602579 3605207 We're running out of time.
3606208 3607293 Okay.
3608711 3610129 Everybody out!
3611714 3612715 Out!
3612798 3614300 <i>Mayor Durant is<br />about to take to the stage</i>
3614383 3617970 and introduce Detroit's newest<br />weapon in the war on crime.
3618053 3621307 I'm actually getting word that<br />he's ready to go right now.
3625853 3628105 Heart rate rising. He<br />might start spiking, Doctor.
3628188 3630816 Set modules to absorb<br />dopamine and noradrenalin.
3630899 3632067 But you will be<br />taking away his emotions.
3632151 3633902 Drop the levels<br />until I tell you to stop.
3633986 3635988 Doctor, you'll be taking away<br />his ability to feel anything.
3636071 3637698 Now, please!
3643078 3645581 Pull the footage.<br />Put it on a loop.
3647916 3649418 Dopamine level's at 20%.
3649585 3650586 More.
3653172 3654340 Dopamine<br />level's at 10%.
3654423 3655549 More.
3656592 3658385 Dopamine level's at 5%.<br />Lower.
3658552 3660429 You're flattening him out.<br />Lower!
3663098 3665100 2%.<br />Hold it there.
3672191 3673442 Alex?
3674777 3676779 Alex, how do you feel?
3680783 3682868 I feel fine, Dr. Norton.
3684578 3688957 Well, today I'm not here to<br />talk about crime prevention.
3689458 3692753 I am here<br />to give you the cure.
3692961 3693962 That's right!
3701637 3702763 Hi, Dad!
3705140 3706225 Dad?
3712272 3715901 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />the revolution begins right now
3716068 3718987 with Detective Alex Murphy!
3736046 3737047 Detective.
3752020 3754356 - What's he doing?<br />- He looks like a zombie.
3755023 3757359 I think he's<br />accessing criminal data.
3764366 3765993 Thomas King!<br />You are under arrest!
3784052 3787764 Until today, Thomas King<br />was a convicted felon
3787848 3791393 wanted for rape, arson,<br />and murder.
3791685 3795564 This man has torn<br />apart American families.
3795981 3799276 On the loose for six years.
3800486 3805574 And where was this<br />criminal mastermind hiding?
3808744 3813707 Right in front of<br />the police headquarters.
3813874 3818420 Here he is, just steps away<br />from two of Detroit's finest.
3818587 3822508 These two officers<br />are completely unaware
3822591 3825594 of the monster<br />in their midst.
3827888 3830474 And then, in 60 seconds...
3830599 3834561 I repeat, just 60 seconds,
3834728 3838232 Detective Murphy<br />brings him down.
3838315 3842194 <i>If you cannot afford an attorney,<br />one will be provided for you.</i>
3843028 3848158 This, my friends, is the<br />future of American justice.
3848784 3851995 How many like Thomas King<br />will pay for their crimes
3852079 3855249 now that RoboCop is here?
3856083 3857209 Yes,
3857292 3861797 let's not shy away<br />from what this means, people.
3862297 3866218 Men weren't up to the task.
3866385 3867844 But Alex Murphy,
3868220 3870180 a <i>robot cop,</i>
3870264 3871306 <i>was.</i>
3872599 3873892 We can't take him<br />off the street.
3873976 3875519 This is what I'm saying.<br />He's a hit.
3875602 3877312 A big, fat, stinking hit.
3877396 3879648 Yeah, until he breaks down<br />in front of everyone.
3879731 3882943 Hey, we all knew there would be issues.<br />It's inevitable.
3883110 3885696 Dennett, you're my guy. I just<br />need you to get a handle on this.
3885779 3886905 I know,<br />but I need more time.
3886989 3889491 Scientifically,<br />we're in uncharted water.
3889575 3891743 We need to take him<br />back to the lab and do more tests.
3891827 3895247 I mean, it was like something was<br />interfering with our system.
3895330 3897749 Something beyond<br />chemistry or physics.
3897916 3899751 Like what? His soul?
3899835 3902337 Hey, look, this train has<br />already left the station.
3902421 3904715 I can't exactly go out<br />to the world and say,
3904798 3907301 "Sorry, I released<br />a defective product."
3907467 3910345 So, no matter what we do, we just<br />need to keep him on the streets.
3910512 3912097 What about the interviews?
3912180 3914600 Cancel 'em.<br />Cancel all of 'em.
3914766 3916101 Everything.
3916810 3918520 In fact, Dennett.
3920981 3923859 <i>Let's keep the wife at a<br />distance for now, as well.</i>
3925027 3926194 <i>I'd like to see him.</i>
3927154 3928488 Can you arrange that?
3928655 3930490 Look, I won't lie to you.
3931033 3934453 Alex was so nervous,<br />we had to sedate him.
3934620 3937289 I looked in his eyes and<br />I couldn't see my husband.
3937372 3941335 And then he just shoots a man in front<br />of our son. That's not sedation.
3942502 3945672 He's responding<br />to drugs differently now.
3947674 3950010 We both knew from day one,
3950677 3953180 there would be complications.
3957476 3959519 Just give me<br />a little more time.
3960479 3962064 I promise,
3963190 3965192 you'll have your husband back.
3967402 3971198 This goes for every<br />squad in every department.
3971365 3974826 Detective Murphy will have full<br />access to all investigations.
3974993 3977537 Robberies,<br />narcotics, homicides.
3977704 3980165 If he requests<br />to take over a case,
3980248 3981833 the case will be<br />handed to him.
3982000 3983752 No arguments,<br />no complaints.
3983919 3984920 This is bullshit!
3985087 3988882 I said no complaints!<br />And I mean it. Now...
3989716 3992594 Good morning, Chief Dean.<br />Good morning, officers.
3992761 3995889 I've selected 13 targets for<br />today, all wanted for murder.
3996264 3997933 John Biggs<br />is target number one.
3998100 3999434 I'll be<br />taking over this case.
3999601 4001353 Ambulances, detention<br />vehicles, and coroners
4001436 4004022 should be ready to<br />move in on my request.
4004189 4006233 I wish you all<br />a very good day.
4013573 4014783 Murphy.
4015450 4016868 You okay, man?
4018745 4020414 I'm fine, Sergeant.
4020956 4022749 Can't wait to<br />get back to work.
4022916 4024710 Lake and Daniels are in there<br />shittin' their pants...
4024793 4026461 Excuse me,<br />I have casework.
4079347 4081016 Don't shoot!<br />Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
4087355 4089316 Walter Karrel,<br />look at me.
4089483 4090776 You have two options.
4090942 4091943 Option one.
4092986 4094863 I shoot you with 50,000 volts
4095030 4098366 which may cause respiratory<br />failure, organ malfunction,
4098450 4100869 internal burns, and loss of<br />bowel and bladder control.
4100952 4102746 And then I arrest you.
4102829 4104372 Option two.<br />You tell me where
4104456 4106792 John Biggs' drug<br />lab is located.
4106875 4108960 And then I arrest you.
4109711 4112005 You have<br />two seconds to decide.
4180782 4182033 Totally justifiable.
4182200 4184452 We are going to make<br />a lot of money.
4184619 4188290 Nothing. No fear.<br />No increase in heart rate.
4188456 4191793 No traces of anger<br />whatsoever.
4192043 4194379 Congratulations, Doctor.
4194713 4196047 You did it.
4197299 4198800 Yes, I did.
4207142 4208435 <i>I told you, sir.</i>
4208602 4211396 Norton clearly never had<br />control of the product.
4211563 4214482 I agree. And that's<br />why I called you here.
4214774 4217485 I just want a second pair of<br />eyes on this thing, that's all.
4217652 4218653 Okay.
4218820 4220697 I'll need a feed<br />from the Tin Man's head
4220822 4222908 plus full surveillance of the lab, and...
4223074 4225493 You're gonna have<br />full access to everything.
4225660 4227495 If anything comes up,
4227579 4229289 I'm gonna be in Washington.
4233335 4234628 <i>He brought peace</i>
4234794 4237255 <i>to this country's<br />most violent city.</i>
4237505 4238506 <i>He showed us all</i>
4238673 4241676 <i>that Detroit and America<br />can have a brighter future.</i>
4242302 4245680 <i>A future of economic growth,<br />freedom, and happiness.</i>
4246014 4250018 On tonight's show,<br />a visionary and true patriot.
4250185 4253772 The CEO of Omnicorp,<br />Raymond Sellars.
4256191 4257192 Hello, Pat.<br />Raymond.
4257275 4258276 Thanks for havin' me.
4258443 4260946 You must be doing<br />a victory lap about now.
4261029 4262030 Well.
4262113 4266034 Two weeks ago, Omni's stock<br />went through the roof.
4266159 4268453 And the Senate<br />has finally agreed
4268536 4270497 to vote on the repeal<br />of the Dreyfus Act.
4270664 4274042 Well, look, I mean, the<br />tide is definitely turning.
4274209 4277045 I just feel certain that soon we'll<br />be keeping all Americans safe.
4277128 4278129 I certainly hope so.
4278505 4281466 But, I think our next guest will<br />have a different point of view.
4281549 4282550 Mmm-hmm.
4282884 4284010 Hubert Dreyfus.
4284552 4286388 Senator,<br />thank you for joining us.
4286554 4288264 <i>Hello, Pat.<br />Mr. Sellars.</i>
4288348 4290642 Senator, do you know<br />what this is?
4290809 4293561 The American public<br />is divided
4293687 4295063 on the Dreyfus Act.
4295230 4300360 Our polls at Novakelement.com<br />are tight at 50-50.
4300568 4304322 <i>There is no doubt<br />Omnicorp created a sensation</i>
4304406 4307826 <i>but this bill is<br />not about Alex Murphy.</i>
4307993 4310954 <i>It's about whether America's<br />willing to give robots</i>
4311037 4312664 <i>the authority<br />over human lives.</i>
4312747 4314332 No. Look, look, look.
4314582 4317085 This sea change<br />we're witnessing,
4317168 4318586 and it is a sea change,
4318670 4320338 shows that Americans<br />don't really care
4320422 4323174 if our law enforcement systems<br />are manned or unmanned.
4323258 4326302 What they care about is efficiency<br />and they care about safety.
4326386 4327637 <i>You're clouding the issue.</i>
4327721 4329264 <i>This is clearly an attempt</i>
4329347 4331766 <i>to sway public opinion<br />with a marketing stunt.</i>
4331933 4333268 What's clear is
4333435 4336896 that with just one system in<br />place, we've cut crime by 80%.
4336980 4339024 Just imagine if we put,
4339107 4341317 I dunno, let's say<br />100 systems in place.
4341568 4343445 And then,<br />I want you to ask yourself,
4343528 4345321 why are you holding us back?
4345405 4346740 <i>Is that your plan?<br />Thank you, Senator.</i>
4346906 4348533 And thank you, Raymond.<br />Thank you, Pat.
4348950 4351619 Well, there you have it.
4352287 4354205 Who could argue with that?
4354289 4356249 Which begs the question.
4357042 4361504 Has the US Senate<br />become pro-crime?
4371181 4372348 Yeah, hi.
4372515 4374142 No, no, 5000.
4374642 4375977 Call me tomorrow.
4377395 4380648 Hey, guys. Vallon's<br />waitin' for you inside.
4382150 4383526 What, you too busy<br />to walk us in?
4383610 4385070 I'm out here makin' money.
4385320 4388073 Where are my trip wires?<br />I gotta do this myself?
4388490 4390825 What the hell is all this shit?
4390992 4392243 I can't move any product
4392327 4393828 with this thing<br />on the streets.
4394537 4396039 What are you doing<br />to protect me?
4396206 4398166 Relax. The guy's<br />a walkin' zombie.
4398333 4399834 And tell me<br />your phones are off.
4400001 4402170 He's not going after you.<br />We covered our tracks.
4402337 4404506 He can't manufacture<br />evidence outta thin air.
4404672 4406382 If he does,<br />I'm ready for him.
4415100 4416184 Well?
4420021 4421356 I've been getting calls.
4421523 4422690 From whom?
4423358 4424734 Well, Clara.
4424901 4428530 You need to let her see her husband.<br />She has rights.
4429280 4432075 That's not your decision.<br />That's Legal's call.
4432408 4434744 Yeah, but it's only<br />a question of time
4434828 4436704 before she turns up<br />on television.
4437038 4438540 Well, she can try.
4439207 4442085 I'll issue a gag order before<br />I let her see her husband.
4443545 4444921 I'd hop to it.
4445713 4448341 Alex. Alex!
4450718 4453513 Alex. You need to come home.
4453680 4455056 Clara, please stand aside.
4455223 4456558 You need to speak<br />to your son.
4456724 4458685 Right now, I see three<br />crimes in progress.
4458852 4460270 Alex, listen to me.
4461729 4462730 I know you're in there.
4465191 4467402 David won't show<br />his face at school.
4468361 4469863 He's having nightmares.
4471698 4474409 He's falling apart.<br />lam falling apart.
4475702 4476911 Please.
4478746 4480790 I can't do this on my own.
4481291 4484419 He's been scared<br />ever since that night.
4493887 4495138 <i>What do you think<br />she's gonna do?</i>
4496222 4497765 What's he gonna do?
4518620 4519954 <i>Are you okay?</i>
4520121 4522123 <i>David? David.</i>
4522957 4525293 <i>Stand back.<br />Come on, stand back!</i>
4545772 4547815 He's supposed to be<br />watching this.
4547982 4552570 Instead, he's accessing images of<br />Clara and David arriving at school.
4552654 4553947 Over and over again.
4554530 4558701 Somehow, he's overriding<br />the system's priorities.
4569212 4571297 <i>- Do you want me to shut him down?<br />- No.</i>
4571464 4572840 Not yet.
4574342 4576052 I wanna see what happens.
4595989 4597907 What's he doing<br />at his house?
4600034 4602078 Look, he's disobeying<br />protocol.
4602161 4603413 You have to shut him down.
4603705 4606666 As far as I can tell,<br />he's still doing his job.
4666309 4668936 Adrian, give me<br />an image of his brain.
4670730 4673149 He's undoing<br />what we did to him.
4673608 4676277 His dopamine levels<br />are coming back to normal.
4676444 4678905 How is that<br />even possible?
4680114 4682408 I haven't the faintest idea.
4682784 4684118 <i>Alex.</i>
4710603 4712980 <i>Alex, please return<br />to the station.</i>
4714023 4715817 I wanna run some tests.
4716651 4718319 Well, this should<br />be interesting.
4735336 4736504 <i>And your phone<br />on the table!</i>
4736629 4738840 We're not cops, all right?<br />We work for Antoine Vallon.
4739006 4741217 - Whoa!<br />- What'd you say?
4742009 4743845 We work for Antoine Vallon.
4772707 4774000 My hand, man!
4774083 4775251 Where's Antoine Vallon?
4775376 4776586 You broke my hand, man!
4777378 4779255 I know you<br />remember me, Jerry.
4783301 4784469 Where's Vallon?
4784552 4785636 Wait a minute.
4785720 4787889 If I tell you where Vallon is,<br />he'll kill my wife and kid, man.
4790016 4793269 Your wife left you in 2019 after<br />filing charges for domestic abuse.
4793352 4795229 And you don't have a kid.
4795688 4796647 But l do.
4798274 4799525 I'm not askin' again!
4799692 4801777 Look, I swear, man. I don't<br />know where Vallon is, okay?
4801944 4805281 The only guy I talk to is his driver<br />Marcus. That's it, man. That's it!
4805865 4807742 Does he have a phone number?
4824091 4827303 We have a problem.<br />Alex is breaking protocol.
4827470 4828471 What's he doing?
4828638 4830765 He's off solving<br />his own murder.
4830932 4833684 Oh, that is genius.
4834101 4835728 Why didn't I think of that?
4842777 4844278 <i>How long<br />till he gets here?</i>
4844445 4846447 <i>Five minutes.<br />All</i> right.
4846822 4848491 Johnny, you stay<br />on these monitors.
4848658 4849951 What happened?
4851244 4853955 Some idiot used<br />an unencrypted phone.
4855289 4856415 Shit.
4864674 4866300 All right, everyone,<br />listen up!
4866676 4867969 He's coming.
4868135 4870972 He leaves alive, you don't.
4872139 4873808 How do we stop him?
4875184 4878354 .50 caliber and above.<br />Aim for the head.
4890324 4891826 This one's set.
4892118 4893286 Let's go. Go!
4893452 4894787 All right, move! Let's go!
4896163 4897999 Come on. Come on!
4899792 4900793 Ready to go!
4901836 4903170 They're all set.
4991133 4992426 Finish it!
5006816 5008109 You freak, die!
5057366 5058659 Watch out.
5058993 5060453 Need me<br />to call a doctor?
5060619 5062621 Come on, Jack.<br />You're gonna like this.
5065332 5066417 What the hell<br />you doin' here?
5066500 5067793 Y'all gonna play<br />good cop, bad cop?
5067877 5070588 Nah, Daniels.<br />Bad cop, RoboCop.
5072548 5075676 I've recovered 26<br />guns from Vallon's warehouse.
5075843 5078637 Thirteen serial numbers match<br />weapons missing from Evidence.
5078804 5080639 And I got your prints<br />all over 'em.
5080806 5081807 This is bullshit.
5081974 5083768 I also<br />have CCTV footage
5083851 5085853 of you and Vallon the same<br />day he tried to kill me.
5086020 5088189 <i>So put him on the payroll.<br />Why we talkin' about this?</i>
5088355 5091650 <i>It won't work. Now that his partner<br />got hit, he's never gonna let it go.</i>
5091817 5093235 <i>- What is that?</i><br /><i>- Lewis' hospital.</i>
5093402 5094862 <i>Murphy's dropping by<br />this afternoon.</i>
5095029 5097907 <i>I kill a cop, I'm lookin'<br />over my shoulder...</i>
5098073 5100367 You know what they do<br />to cops in prison, man?
5100826 5103412 Being locked up with the<br />same dudes you put in there?
5106749 5108459 How long you think<br />before he gives you up?
5112213 5114882 Don't shoot me. Okay?
5115883 5118219 I swear to Christ.<br />It was Dean.
5118385 5121263 She helped pull those guns.<br />Just don't shoot me.
5123224 5125226 Thank you<br />for your cooperation.
5127353 5128896 You can cuff him now, Jack.
5137988 5139865 Now I know why we<br />couldn't get an arrest.
5141200 5143285 'Cause Vallon was protected<br />from up on high.
5143369 5145079 Alex, I can explain.
5145746 5147122 You tipped<br />him off today.
5147206 5148457 Come on, man.<br />Don't do this.
5148541 5150459 You tried to kill me twice.
5150543 5153838 I trusted you.<br />And you destroyed my family.
5154129 5155130 Confess.
5156465 5158133 Now, in front of everyone.
5158259 5159260 Confess!
5169103 5170104 What happened?
5170271 5172398 Tin Man is down.<br />Had to be done.
5172565 5173566 <i>Why?</i>
5173732 5174984 Product shot a corrupt cop.
5175067 5176527 Two more seconds,<br />the chief's brains
5176610 5179113 would've been splattered<br />across the 6:00 news.
5179572 5180656 We got anything on her?
5180823 5183158 Well, she's the Chief of<br />the Detroit Police Department.
5183242 5185119 What do you think?
5188956 5190249 You know what?
5191667 5194920 This might actually tip this<br />thing right into the net.
5201343 5204513 <i>Alex, I don't<br />know if you can hear me.</i>
5204805 5208100 <i>But tonight,<br />you uncovered a nest of vipers</i>
5208267 5210686 <i>inside<br />the Detroit Police Department.</i>
5210853 5215190 <i>And in so doing, you shed<br />light on an invaluable truth.</i>
5215816 5217276 Even the police,
5217359 5221363 the men and women<br />who swore to keep us safe,
5222156 5223657 they can be bribed.
5224283 5227161 They can be bought.
5228787 5232917 Machines, however,<br />are corruption free.
5233876 5236086 Americans could be<br />living in a country
5236170 5239506 where law enforcement<br />is not only efficient,
5239840 5241342 but incorruptible.
5242676 5244970 Thank you, Alex,<br />for all you've done.
5245137 5246847 And for all that you are.
5247348 5250517 <i>Detective Murphy is currently<br />in critical condition.</i>
5251185 5253938 Our doctors<br />are working ceaselessly
5254021 5256774 but, at this time, it is<br />unclear if he will survive.
5258067 5260069 <i>Ms. Kline,<br />how do you think the attempt</i>
5260152 5262029 <i>on Detective<br />Alex Murphy's life</i>
5262112 5264406 <i>will affect tomorrow's vote<br />for the Dreyfus Act?</i>
5264490 5266367 <i>At this time,<br />Omnicorp's sole concern</i>
5266450 5268535 <i>is the full recovery<br />of Detective Murphy.</i>
5269662 5271830 <i>How many times<br />does Detective Murphy</i>
5271914 5274333 <i>have to give his life<br />for his country?</i>
5275000 5279838 <i>I sincerely hope the Senate<br />makes the right vote tomorrow</i>
5279922 5284510 <i>so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices<br />will not have been in vain.</i>
5289223 5291475 <i>Senator Dreyfus is my friend.</i>
5291558 5294353 <i>He has been<br />my mentor and my strength</i>
5294436 5296897 <i>in times of difficulty<br />on this floor.</i>
5297398 5300484 <i>But despite all that,<br />I work for the state of Ohio,</i>
5300567 5303696 <i>and the safety of its citizens<br />is my top priority.</i>
5304071 5305114 <i>So I vote yes.</i>
5305280 5307574 <i>The Dreyfus Act<br />must be repealed.</i>
5307908 5310077 That's us ahead,<br />39 to 10.
5310244 5313163 I spoke to the Senate liaison and<br />it looks like it's in the bag,
5313247 5316333 but we still have to tread<br />carefully with the politicians.
5317918 5320170 <i>We're here live<br />at DPD headquarters</i>
5320254 5323007 <i>where moments ago, Clara Murphy<br />made a shocking statement.</i>
5323090 5324299 What the hell?
5324383 5329430 <i>Omnicorp has denied me and my<br />son access to Alex for weeks.</i>
5330097 5331932 <i>I demand to know why.</i>
5332933 5337938 <i>This treatment is inhuman and somebody<br />needs to be held accountable.</i>
5339148 5340941 Oh, we're fucked.
5341108 5342484 No, we only need 12 votes.
5342568 5344069 She shouldn't make<br />much difference.
5344236 5346447 Yeah, but what about<br />after the vote?
5346530 5348365 I mean, those two should<br />not be allowed contact.
5348449 5350868 If she starts<br />putting ideas in his head...
5350993 5353662 Bring her in.<br />I'll handle the explanation.
5353829 5355289 And what about Alex?
5355372 5357624 You know, unfortunately,<br />we can't just keep him on ice.
5358292 5360836 The shooting at the station<br />spooked some of the politicians.
5360919 5363422 They're our clients.<br />We have to take care of them.
5363589 5367009 They're fine when a machine<br />is lowering the murder rate,
5367092 5370387 but when a man is investigating<br />city politics, they get nervous.
5370471 5372848 All right. First off,<br />it's not a man, okay?
5372931 5374892 It's property of Omnicorp.
5374975 5377227 And politics are<br />the least of your concern.
5377311 5378979 I mean, this thing<br />solved its own murder.
5379146 5381523 How long till it realizes you<br />haven't been on the level with it?
5381607 5382733 If that happens,
5382816 5385736 every journalist in this country<br />is dying to speak to him.
5385819 5387780 I mean, we created a hero.
5388322 5390991 What happens<br />when he opens his mouth?
5394495 5396205 What's bigger than a hero?
5407883 5409176 Dead hero.
5413514 5415474 Get me Dr. Norton.
5424525 5425651 What is this, Raymond?
5426777 5430781 You have Mattox spying on me and now this<br />bullshit about a "critical condition"?
5430948 5433659 You know and I know<br />Alex is fine!
5433826 5434993 Calm down.
5435160 5436662 <i>Bennett.</i>
5436829 5437996 Your work is so good,<br />I don't...
5438080 5439414 Well, now,<br />this is not about my work!
5439498 5441416 You saw the woman on TV!
5441583 5443710 This has to stop!
5445546 5446839 You're right.
5447548 5449550 But let me<br />ask you something, Dennett.
5449716 5452136 What kind of life have we<br />really given Alex Murphy?
5452219 5455764 He's never gonna be a normal<br />man, a father, a husband.
5455848 5459101 By the time we put the other units<br />on the street, he's just...
5459268 5460352 <i>Bennett.</i>
5462229 5463730 Let's face it.
5464565 5466066 We failed him.
5467526 5469444 We failed Alex Murphy.
5469528 5471155 But I want you to think<br />about the bigger picture
5471238 5472739 because that's what<br />we're talking about.
5472865 5475617 The work you've done with him is<br />gonna be studied for decades.
5475701 5477911 You've changed<br />the face of history, Dennett.
5477995 5482291 No policeman is ever going to<br />die in the line of duty again
5483041 5484585 because of you.
5486253 5487713 You think about that.
5496221 5500184 I want that family<br />taken care of
5500267 5501768 beyond their wildest dreams.
5501810 5503896 We owe them that.<br />I agree.
5504646 5507983 I want full funding.<br />Ten years.
5508400 5510068 New staff, all my own people.
5510235 5511778 Fantastic.
5512487 5513488 Deal.
5523874 5525375 Hey. What's going on?
5525459 5527544 Security's here.<br />They're clearing everyone out.
5527628 5529379 They're not waking him up.
5529463 5531340 Whatever you do,<br />don't leave him alone.
5531423 5532966 What do you mean<br />they're not waking him up?

5587688 5590607 But I am not gonna stop till I see<br />my husband. Do you understand that?
5590899 5593652 Mr. Sellars would<br />very much like to see you.
5595195 5596697 Is Alex okay?
5596947 5600409 He has important information to share<br />with you. Will you accompany me?
5602744 5603912 David.
5605622 5607874 We gotta go.<br />Can you grab your coat?

5622264 5624141 She will not let us in. She's<br />got the codes for the door.

5638613 5639740 Don't shoot!
5639823 5641199 Step outside.
5647664 5649333 Unlock the transmitter!
5650709 5651710 Transmitter<br />unlocked!

5675942 5677694 These men are here<br />to kill us.
5677778 5680238 They're here to kill us,<br />for chrissakes!
5685118 5686828 <i>Mrs. Murphy, last night,</i>
5686912 5688914 Alex had a psychotic break.
5688997 5693293 He killed an unarmed colleague<br />and later suffered a seizure.
5694419 5695921 We did everything,
5696004 5698924 everything, we could, but the<br />doctors couldn't save him.
5700384 5702427 Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.
5702719 5705263 We're going to be making<br />the announcement shortly.
5705722 5708183 You shut me down. I was<br />about to get a confession.
5708809 5710477 Mattox shut you down.
5711812 5714689 I've removed your transmitter<br />so he won't do it again.
5715107 5717275 Sellars can't afford<br />to wake you up.
5718318 5720445 He sent these guys<br />to pull the plug.
5720904 5724408 He wants you dead, Alex.<br />Do you understand?
5724574 5726410 Sorry. If there's<br />anything we can do
5726493 5727828 for you and David,<br />we'll do it.
5727994 5730122 I want nothing from you.
5731081 5732374 I understand.
5732958 5735252 You stay out of our lives.
5736670 5737879 You and your company.
5738171 5740048 If that's what<br />you think is best.
5741007 5742467 There's one more thing.
5742551 5745387 I think it would be to the benefit<br />of everyone, especially David
5745470 5747681 if we kept<br />this matter private.
5747931 5750475 We don't wanna<br />damage Alex's legacy.

5759943 5761570 You're working for the people<br />that are trying to kill me.
5761653 5762904 You want me<br />to trust you, Doctor?
5762988 5765031 Alex, I can go to the press!
5766450 5769035 Alex, I can tell them<br />the whole story!

5771329 5773248 Listen to me, please!
5774249 5777544 Alex! Alex!
5789181 5790223 What the hell?
5798607 5799983 Keep all our systems<br />at green light,
5800066 5802152 and for chrissakes,<br />get Sellars on the phone.
5802235 5803236 <i>Roger</i> that.
5803320 5805280 Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!
5806615 5808200 Look at this city.
5810035 5811578 So beautiful.
5812579 5815248 It's become so peaceful.
5818043 5819377 I Wish
5820378 5822631 I had some good news<br />for Detroit.
5823131 5824883 I have very sad news.
5825050 5827719 Despite our best efforts<br />to save him,
5828011 5830472 Alex Murphy passed away<br />just hours ago.
5830889 5832182 Alex Murphy was...
5832265 5833475 Mr. Sellars.
5833892 5835477 What is it?<br />Mattox just called.
5836061 5837896 We need you to<br />come with us now.
5844194 5845987 Ma'am, I need you to turn around<br />and go the other way, please.
5846112 5848114 What are you talking about? We<br />have a security situation here.
5848198 5849616 I need you to turn around<br />and go the other way.
5849699 5851576 Sir, there's a car outside<br />that's supposed to...
5851660 5853286 That area is locked down.<br />Now go.
5853370 5855038 What's happening?<br />I said go!
5855372 5857374 I wanna talk to Mr. Sellars.
5860293 5861378 Mr. Sellars.
5861545 5863505 How close is that helicopter?<br />About 10 minutes, sir.
5881356 5882607 Excuse me.<br />Yes?
5882774 5885110 I need to speak with<br />Sergeant Jack Lewis.
5885277 5886486 It's an emergency.
5886653 5888280 Stand by. Mr. Sellars.
5888738 5890448 Apparently there's a Clara<br />Murphy in the lobby.
5890615 5893952 Raymond, if she sees him,<br />we are dead in the water.
5894119 5896454 What do you wanna do?<br />Bring Mrs. Murphy up here.
5896621 5897706 Yes, sir.
5901626 5904421 Norton said they may be<br />using drones for protection.
5904588 5906631 So whatever you do,<br />do not draw your weapons.
5906798 5909426 They won't shoot<br />if we're unarmed. Clear?
5909509 5910510 Clear.<br />Clear.
5926901 5928278 Hold it right there.
5929279 5930280 Don't move.
5934034 5937370 This is private property. You<br />are not authorized to be here!
5941291 5943627 I'd put those guns down now<br />if I were you.
5943793 5945462 Stand down.<br />All right, man, we're good.
5991925 5993259 Head to the lower level.
5994886 5995887 Hold up, hold up!
5996012 5997222 Ram it!
6057490 6058783 Gun it.
6060243 6061828 GO, go, go! Now!
6077802 6079304 Alex, run!
6080138 6082182 Omnicorp Security!<br />Drop your weapons!
6082348 6084267 Drop your weapon.
6084434 6087228 <i>Keep your hands above your head<br />and no one will be harmed.</i>
6102494 6103620 What's going on?
6103703 6105955 Mrs. Murphy, I want you to<br />listen to me carefully.
6106122 6108625 The organic part of<br />your husband Alex is dead.
6108708 6110835 The robotic part of him<br />is malfunctioning,
6110919 6112003 and he's shooting up<br />the building.
6112086 6114881 So we've gotta get you and your<br />son out of here right away.
6115048 6116591 I gotta take this call.
6117884 6119469 He just left the lobby<br />and he's headed our way.
6119552 6121095 <i>Roger that, sir.</i>
6121513 6124557 Don't shoot. My robot. You just flank.<br />Got it.
6124724 6125975 Tin Man.
6128728 6129938 Tin Man.
6130980 6132232 Tin Man.
6132816 6133983 Oh, there it is.
6134651 6136027 You look like crap.
6138655 6139823 What's the matter?
6139989 6141199 Can't shoot?
6142992 6144077 Huh?
6144828 6146913 What were you thinking?<br />This isn't a drill.
6146996 6147997 You're a robot.
6148206 6150416 I'm a red asset.<br />Wrote that myself.
6150875 6152168 What do you think?
6152585 6155421 Come on, Tin Man,<br />just pull the trigger.
6155588 6156589 Pull it.
6157382 6158466 You can run.
6159008 6160009 Go on.
6160260 6161386 Run.
6161845 6162971 Run!
6163304 6165139 There you go. Run.
6165598 6166933 Run.Run!
6170103 6171521 Whoo!
6171604 6173731 Stings like a bitch,<br />don't it?
6173898 6177193 Aren't you lucky I didn't<br />have my gun set to "kill"?
6178444 6179779 Hey, listen.
6180238 6181823 This isn't personal.
6182866 6184617 Well, maybe a little.
6186369 6188204 I'm gonna put you<br />out of your misery.
6199924 6201384 <i>Helicopter's approaching.</i>
6201467 6202719 Mr. Sellars boards first.
6202802 6205763 No, no, no. Mrs. Murphy, you<br />and your son can get on first.
6211185 6212478 Officer down.
6212562 6213688 Mechanical room.
6213771 6215356 Omnicorp Building.
6215523 6217400 <i>Roger that. EMS on the way.</i>
6219027 6220612 You're gonna be okay, Jack.
6220695 6221946 It's nonfatal.
6222030 6223615 Go. Go.
6224824 6227619 Omni-LZ Helo-1<br />on approach to deck.
6234375 6235376 What's that?
6237295 6238421 He's got a gun!<br />What?
6238588 6239589 Pull up! Pull up!
6244552 6246846 What the hell is he doing?<br />Sorry, sir. I don't know.
6252393 6253394 Alex?
6253561 6254562 Dad?
6257982 6259400 Clara, David.
6260401 6261569 Whoa, whoa,<br />whoa, whoa.
6261653 6262654 Wait.
6263738 6265615 Get out of the way.<br />Alex, put down the gun.
6265782 6267867 Clara, take David<br />and get out of the way now!
6269744 6271120 Raymond Sellars,<br />you're under arrest
6271204 6272956 for the attempted murder<br />of a police officer.
6276668 6279170 Are you here to cuff me?<br />All right.
6279963 6281422 Go 'head, cuff me.
6282632 6285218 You can't. You're not<br />programmed that way.
6285301 6286803 If you go against<br />the program,
6286886 6288721 the entire system<br />shuts down, so.
6288888 6290974 You don't even have a warrant.<br />We'll overlook this little...
6291140 6293226 Get down on the ground and put<br />your hands behind your back.
6293393 6294394 I'm just from marketing.
6294560 6296896 Now! Ok a)', yep, yep, yep Yep
6297063 6299232 Alex, we need to<br />work together here.
6299399 6302485 Because I'm the only one with the<br />technology to keep you alive.
6303611 6305238 Dead or alive,<br />you're coming with me.
6311369 6312370 All right.
6312537 6313538 Weapon.
6315206 6318334 Alex, honestly,<br />I mean you no harm.
6318501 6320795 If I wanted to, I could have<br />killed you a long time ago.
6320962 6322839 I just aim this right at<br />your head and blow it off.
6322922 6324757 Sellars, please! Don't!
6324924 6327468 I mean, if I wanted to, I could<br />just aim this at your little family
6328803 6330388 and I could just<br />kill them too.
6330513 6332181 And really, there's nothing<br />you could do about it
6332265 6334267 because, let's face it,
6334892 6336227 you're a robot.
6336853 6338312 Do you understand that?
6342567 6343568 Alex.
6346738 6347989 Dad!
6352118 6353369 Baby.
6358958 6360043 Hey.
6361669 6362670 Hey.
6363171 6365173 Everything's gonna be<br />all right.
6366132 6368384 Everything's gonna be<br />all right.
6418267 6420019 How you feeling, Alex?
6421938 6423064 I'm ready.
6460852 6462228 He's ready.
6496345 6497513 There's still no word
6497597 6500600 from Omnicorp<br />parent company, OCP.
6501517 6505271 And although the government says<br />they are rebuilding Alex Murphy,
6505354 6508065 rumors continue to swirl<br />about his condition.
6508149 6512695 But we have obtained exclusive<br />video taken by cell phone
6512778 6515198 that shows<br />the people of Detroit
6515281 6517366 may have Alex Murphy<br />back on the streets
6517450 6519035 sooner than they think.
6521078 6522580 The real tragedy here
6522663 6527460 is that our president chose<br />to uphold the Dreyfus Act.
6528836 6533591 Now, I have no doubt he was<br />manipulated by our biased media
6533674 6537136 and by whistle-blower<br />Dennett Norton.
6537220 6540973 <i>I acknowledge we know<br />less than we thought.</i>
6541974 6544894 <i>But I do believe<br />my research program is sound.</i>
6546479 6547730 <i>What I did With it</i>
6549232 6550274 <i>was wrong.</i>
6550358 6553361 The fact that this<br />mother...
6553444 6556697 is not serving time<br />in some federal penitentiary
6556781 6560785 is a huge, hot, heaping<br />pile of horse...
6566540 6570920 Now I know some of you may think that<br />this kind of thinking is dangerous
6571003 6575007 and these machines<br />violate your civil liberties.
6575174 6579303 Some of you even believe that the<br />use of these drones overseas
6579387 6584058 makes us the same kind of<br />bullying imperialists
6584141 6586894 that our forefathers<br />were trying to escape.
6587353 6589814 To you, I say...
6589981 6592358 Stop whining!
6594193 6596821 America is now
6596904 6599198 and always will be
6599282 6603703 the greatest country<br />on the face of the Earth!
6608249 6609792 I'm Pat Novak.
6611294 6612545 Good night.
