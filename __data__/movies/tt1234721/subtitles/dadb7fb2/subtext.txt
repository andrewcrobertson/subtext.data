71625 73601 -(singing descending scale)<br />-DIRECTOR: And we're on
73625 78574 in four, three, two, one.
80542 84080 What if I told you that even the<br />worst neighborhood in America
84208 86074 could be made completely safe,
86208 89075 and what if I told you<br />that this could be accomplished
89208 93748 without risking the life of one<br />single law enforcement officer?
93917 95078 How do I know this?
95208 97575 Because it's happening right now
97667 102537 in every country in the world<br />but this one.
102625 106789 I'm Pat Novak, and welcome<br />to “The Novak Element."
109833 112245 In tonight's<br />State of the Union segment
112375 114116 we'll be joined<br />by General Curtis Monroe,
114250 117242 live from the War Room<br />in the Pentagon.
117333 120121 General Monroe, welcome back.
120250 121957 - Good to see you, Pat.<br />- Uh, thank you
122083 125906 for this unprecedented<br />access to your operation.
126042 127749 Could you walk us through
127833 129574 what we're seeing here?
129667 131954 Well, this is a, uh,<br />a routine operation.
132083 133949 We found that random patrols
134083 135744 helped the local population
135875 137741 to feel safer and to trust us.
137833 138743 It's amazing.
138833 140415 And what are these colored dots
140542 142909 that we're seeing here, General?
143042 145249 These are our assets<br />on the ground.
145333 148246 Uh, in green,<br />we got the ED-2093.
148333 151291 They're the big boys,<br />they secure the perimeter.
151417 153124 Purple are the smaller EM-2083.
153250 154740 They sweep and mop up.
154875 157788 And the red dots, Pat,<br />that's your film crew.
157917 159624 (laughs)
159750 162583 It is great to see<br />American machines
162667 165250 helping to promote peace<br />and freedom abroad.
165375 167615 All right, you guys, this is<br />just standard op, all right?
167667 168953 There's no opposition expected.
169083 171575 I'm gonna set your<br />markers to code red.
171667 172873 (bopping)
174667 177375 All our drones are gonna give<br />top priority to your safety.
177458 179574 No red assets<br />have ever been lost.
179667 180702 - Okay.<br />- Okay?
180792 182123 That make you feel better?
182250 184036 - (woman chuckles)<br />- But, listen,
184250 185684 you keep those bracelets on,<br />you're completely safe.
185708 186948 - Okay.<br />- Okay?
187083 188539 Okay, enjoy the show.
194333 196700 All right, let's go.

234875 236912 Your cooperation is appreciated.
237000 240698 We apologize for<br />any inconvenience.
240792 241792 As-salaamu alaikum.

251792 252907 Incredible.
253000 255287 In... credible!
255417 259285 Not long ago, that would have<br />been American men and women
259375 263369 risking their lives<br />to pacify these people.
263458 264948 Uh, General, you care
265083 266414 to comment on this?
266500 269458 Well, Pat, we had<br />Vietnam, we had Iraq,
269583 272075 we had Afghanistan...
272167 273703 Never again.
273792 276750 From a military perspective,<br />this has been invaluable.
276833 278198 We can accomplish our objectives
278292 280750 without any loss<br />to American lives,
280833 282744 and I think<br />the honest people over there
282833 284619 really appreciate it.
284750 286081 A-And why wouldn't they?
286167 288750 For the first time<br />in their lives,
288833 290744 they get to watch<br />their children grow up
290833 295157 in an environment<br />of safety and security.

484083 488702 Why is America so robophobic?
490042 493740 On the one hand,<br />we have Raymond Sellars,

496875 500243 whose product just saved<br />my colleague's life,
500333 502244 and on the other,

505000 509369 a man with both feet<br />planted firmly in the past,
509458 513873 whose bill prohibits the use<br />of drones on US. soil.
513958 516871 The American people support<br />the Dreyfus Act
516958 520576 because they haven't experienced<br />this technology

3967792 3969783 there would be complications.
3975125 3977992 Just give me a little more time.

4008750 4010661 Good morning, officers.
4010792 4013534 I've selected 13 targets for<br />today, all wanted for murder.
4013667 4014953 John Biggs is target number one.
4015042 4016282 I'll be taking over this case.
4016375 4018992 Ambulances, detention<br />vehicles, and coroners
4019083 4021666 should be ready<br />to move in on my request.

4036208 4038119 I'm fine, Sergeant.

4106917 4108328 You have two options.
4108417 4109498 Option one:
4109583 4112416 I shoot you with 50,000 volts,
4112500 4115822 which may cause respiratory<br />failure, organ malfunction,
4115958 4118325 internal burns, and loss of<br />bowel and bladder control,
4118417 4120328 and then I arrest you.
4120417 4121873 Option two: You tell me
4122000 4124332 where John Biggs' drug lab<br />is located,
4124417 4127000 and then I arrest you.
4127083 4129871 You have two seconds to decide.

4262250 4264161 On tonight's show,
4264250 4267322 a visionary and true patriot:
4267417 4271365 The CEO of Omnicorp,<br />Raymond Sellars.
4271500 4273207 (applause)
4273333 4274198 - Hello, Pat.<br />- Raymond.
4274333 4275664 Thanks for having me.
4275792 4278375 You must be doing a<br />victory lap about now.
4278500 4280491 - Well...<br />- Two weeks ago,
4280583 4282995 Omni's stock went<br />through the roof,
4283083 4285495 and the Senate<br />has finally agreed
4285583 4287824 to vote on the repeal<br />of the Dreyfus Act.
4287958 4290791 Well, look, I mean,<br />the tide is definitely turning.
4290875 4292832 I, I just feel certain<br />that, soon,
4292917 4294328 we'll be keeping<br />all Americans safe.
4294417 4295498 I certainly hope so,
4295583 4297665 but I think<br />our next guest will have
4297750 4298790 a different point of view.
4298875 4299990 SELLARS:<br />Mm-hmm.
4300083 4301665 Hubert Dreyfus.
4301750 4303787 Senator, thank you<br />for joining us.
4303875 4305206 Hello, Pat. Mr. Sellars.
4305333 4308200 Senator, do you know<br />what this is?
4308333 4310870 The American public is divided
4311000 4312490 on the Dreyfus Act.
4312667 4317491 Our polls at NovakElement.com<br />are tight at 50-50.
4317625 4321493 There is no doubt Omnicorp<br />created a sensation,
4321625 4325118 but this bill is not<br />about Alex Murphy.
4325208 4327996 It's about whether America<br />is willing to give robots
4328083 4329268 the authority over human lives.
4329292 4331784 No, no, no, no,<br />look, look, look.
4331875 4334458 This, uh, sea change<br />we're witnessing...
4334542 4337409 And it is a sea change... shows<br />that Americans don't really care
4337500 4340208 if our law enforcement systems<br />are manned or unmanned.
4340333 4342199 What they care about<br />is efficiency
4342333 4343619 and they care about safety.
4343708 4345164 You're clouding the issue.
4345292 4348000 This is clearly an attempt<br />to sway public opinion
4348083 4350620 - with a marketing stunt.<br />- No, what's clear is
4350708 4352449 that with just one system<br />in place,
4352542 4353998 we've cut crime by 80%.
4354083 4356620 Just imagine if we put,<br />I don't know,
4356708 4358059 let's say<br />a hundred systems in place.
4358083 4360996 And then I want you<br />to ask yourself,
4361083 4362619 why are you holding us back?
4362708 4363934 - Is that your plan?<br />- Thank you, Senator.
4363958 4365824 - And thank you, Raymond.<br />- Thank you, Pat.
4365917 4369205 Well, there you have it.
4369333 4371199 Who could argue with that?
4371333 4373950 Which begs the question:
4374083 4376165 <i>Has the US. Senate</i>
4376250 4379743 become pro-crime?

4400625 4402184 - I'm out here making money.<br />- Yeah, no, I know.

4403458 4404994 I gotta do this myself?

4449542 4451533 Yeah, but it's only<br />a question of time
4451667 4454034 before she turns up<br />on television.
4454167 4456158 Well, she can try.
4456250 4459038 I'll issue a gag order before<br />I let her see her husband.

4468708 4470540 You need to come home.
4470667 4472203 Clara, please stand aside.
4472333 4474449 - You need to speak to your son.<br />- Right now,
4474542 4475828 I see three crimes in progress.
4475958 4477494 - My objective...<br />- Alex, listen to me.
4477583 4479995 I know you're in there.
4482042 4484204 David won't show<br />his face at school.

5094750 5096059 and I got your prints<br />all over them.
5096083 5097824 This is bullshit.
5097917 5098952 I also have
5099083 5101040 CCTV footage of you and Vallon
5101167 5102498 the same day he<br />tried to kill me.
5102583 5104165 VALLON:<br />So put him on the payroll.
5104292 5106143 ...Why we talking about this?<br />- DANIELS: It won't work.
5106167 5108226 Now that his partner got hit,<br />he's never gonna let it go.
5108250 5109832 - What is that?<br />- Lewis's hospital.
5109958 5111448 Murphy's dropping by<br />this afternoon.
5111625 5113059 If I kill a cop, I'm looking<br />over my shoulder.
5113083 5114363 I kill a cop,<br />I'm looking over...
5114417 5115817 LEWIS:<br />You know what they do to cops
5115875 5117832 in prison, man?<br />Being locked up
5117917 5119373 with the same dudes<br />you put in there?
5119500 5121351 VALLON: I kill a cop,<br />I'm looking over my shoulder
5121375 5122160 the rest of my life.
5122250 5123250 If I kill a cop...
5123333 5124994 How long you think<br />before he gives you up?
5125083 5126790 (people screaming)
5127667 5129283 Don't shoot me.
5129375 5132208 Okay?
5132292 5134704 I swear to Christ, it was Dean.
5134833 5136369 She helped pull those guns.
5136458 5139450 Just don't shoot me.
5139542 5141249 Thank you for your cooperation.
5142458 5143619 (Lake groaning)
5143708 5145415 You can cuff him now, Jack.
5154333 5156791 Now, I know why<br />we couldn't get an arrest.
5156875 5159663 'Cause Vallon was protected<br />from up on high.
5159792 5161999 Alex, I can explain.
5162125 5163365 You tipped him off today.
5163500 5164581 Come on, man.<br />Don't do this.
5164708 5166449 You tried to kill me twice.
5166542 5168658 I trusted you,
5168750 5170206 and you destroyed my family.
5170333 5172665 Confess.
5172750 5174661 Now, in front of everyone.
5174792 5175657 Confess!
5175792 5177408 (power whirrs off)
5185542 5186542 What happened?
5186583 5187768 MATTOX (over radio):<br />Tin Man is down.
5187792 5188827 Had to be done.
5188917 5189952 Why?
5190042 5191373 Product shot a corrupt cop.
5191500 5192956 Two more seconds,<br />the chief's brains
5193042 5195625 would've been splattered<br />across the 6:00 News.
5195708 5197995 - We got anything on her?<br />- Well, she's, uh,
5198083 5199763 the Chief of the Detroit<br />Police Department.
5199833 5202200 What do you think?
5204917 5207158 You know what?
5207292 5210865 This might actually tip<br />this thing right into the net.
5217667 5220500 NOVAK: Alex, I don't know<br />if you can hear me,
5220583 5224497 but tonight,<br />you uncovered a nest of vipers
5224625 5226662 inside the Detroit<br />Police Department.
5226750 5229287 And in so doing, you shed light
5229375 5232117 on an invaluable truth.
5232208 5233619 Even the police,
5233708 5235324 the men and women
5235417 5238330 who swore to keep us safe,
5238458 5240540 they can be bribed.
5240625 5243242 They... can be bought.
5244875 5247162 Machines, however,
5247292 5249659 are corruption-free.
5249750 5252538 Americans could be living<br />in a country
5252667 5255989 where law enforcement<br />is not only efficient,
5256083 5258996 but incorruptible.
5259083 5261040 Thank you, Alex,<br />for all you've done,
5261167 5263204 and for all that you are.
5263333 5266655 Detective Murphy is currently<br />in critical condition.
5266833 5269495 Our doctors are<br />working ceaselessly
5269583 5272496 but, at this time, it is<br />unclear if he will survive.
5272625 5274207 (reporters clamoring)
5274333 5276199 KELLY: Ms. Kline,<br />how do you think the attempt
5276333 5278290 on Detective Alex Murphy's life
5278375 5280662 will affect tomorrow's vote<br />for the Dreyfus Act?
5280750 5282536 LIZ: At this time,<br />Omnicorp's sole concern
5282667 5285125 is the full recovery<br />of Detective Murphy.
5285208 5287495 NOVAK: How many times<br />does Detective Murphy
5287667 5290500 have to give his life<br />for his country?
5290625 5294163 I sincerely hope
5294292 5296158 the Senate makes<br />the right vote tomorrow,
5296250 5297991 so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices
5298083 5300825 will not have been in vain.
5305083 5307290 OHIO SENATOR (voice-over):<br />Senator Dreyfus is my friend.
5307375 5310493 He has been<br />my mentor and my strength
5310583 5312494 in times of difficulty<br />on this floor.
5312583 5315996 But despite all that,<br />I work for the state of Ohio
5316083 5319371 and the safety of its citizens<br />is my top priority.
5319500 5321491 So I vote yes.
5321625 5323491 The Dreyfus Act<br />must be repealed.
5323583 5326291 That's us ahead, 39 to 10.
5326375 5327831 Yeah, I spoke to<br />the Senate liaison,
5327958 5329665 and it looks like<br />it's in the bag.
5329750 5332162 But we still have to tread<br />carefully with the politicians.
5334542 5336533 We're here live<br />at DPD headquarters
5336667 5338999 where moments ago, Clara Murphy<br />made a shocking statement.
5339083 5340494 POPE:<br />What the hell?
5340583 5343450 Omnicorp has denied me<br />and my son
5343542 5345158 access to Alex for weeks.
5345292 5348455 I demand to know why.
5348542 5350704 This treatment is inhuman,
5350833 5353825 and somebody needs<br />to be held accountable.
5355458 5357199 - CLARA: Thank you.<br />- Oh, we're fucked.
5357292 5358828 No, we only need 12 votes.
5358958 5360184 She shouldn't make<br />much difference.
5360208 5361434 Yeah, but what about<br />after the vote?
5361458 5362789 We... I mean,
5362875 5364434 those two should not<br />be allowed contact.
5364458 5367120 If-if she starts putting ideas<br />in his head...
5367208 5368369 Bring her in.
5368500 5369601 I'll handle the explanation.
5369625 5370706 And what about Alex?
5370833 5372323 You know, unfortunately,
5372417 5373873 we can't just keep him on ice.
5373958 5375619 LIZ: The shooting<br />at the station
5375708 5377164 spooked some of the politicians.
5377292 5379659 They're our clients;<br />We have to take care of them.
5379792 5382033 They're fine when a machine<br />is lowering the murder rate,
5382167 5385285 but when a man<br />is investigating city politics,
5385375 5386831 they get nervous.
5386958 5388995 All right, first off,<br />it's not a man, okay?
5389083 5390699 It's property of Omnicorp.
5390833 5393495 And politics are the<br />least of your concern.
5393583 5395199 I mean, this thing<br />solved its own murder.
5395333 5396494 How long till it realizes
5396625 5397893 you haven't been<br />on the level with it?
5397917 5399624 POPE: If that happens,<br />every journalist
5399708 5401308 in this country<br />is dying to speak to him.
5401375 5403707 I mean, we-we created a hero.
5404708 5407291 What happens<br />when he opens his mouth?
5410000 5412492 What's bigger than a hero?
5422917 5425830 A dead hero.
5429625 5431616 Get me Dr. Norton.
5440583 5441914 What is this, Raymond?
5442000 5444241 You have Mattox spying on me
5444333 5446620 and now this bullshit<br />about a "critical condition"?
5446750 5448741 You know and I know
5448833 5450119 Alex is fine!
5450250 5451456 Calm down.
5451583 5452618 What... Dennett.
5452750 5453976 Your work is so good, I don't...
5454000 5455351 Well, now,<br />this is not about my work!
5455375 5456456 You saw the woman on TV!
5456583 5459245 This has to stop!
5461625 5463536 You're right.
5463667 5465283 But let me<br />ask you something, Dennett.
5465417 5468250 What kind of life have we really<br />given Alex Murphy?
5468333 5469949 He's never gonna be<br />a normal man,
5470042 5471828 a father, a husband.
5471958 5474120 By the time we put<br />the other units on the street,
5474250 5476582 he's just... Dennett...
5476667 5477953 (sighs)
5478083 5480666 Let's face it.
5480792 5483580 We failed him.
5483667 5485328 We failed Alex Murphy.
5485417 5487297 But I want you to think<br />about the bigger picture
5487375 5489116 because that's<br />what we're talking about.
5489250 5491742 The work you've done with him<br />is gonna be studied for decades.
5491833 5493949 You've changed<br />the face of history, Dennett.
5494083 5497121 No policeman<br />is ever going to die
5497208 5498448 in the line of duty again
5498542 5500874 because of you.
5502375 5504366 Think about that.
5511917 5514409 I want that family
5514500 5517413 taken care of<br />beyond their wildest dreams.
5517500 5518615 We owe them that.
5518708 5520164 I agree.
5520292 5522499 I want full funding
5522625 5524115 for ten years.
5524208 5526245 New staff, all my own people.
5526333 5528119 Fantastic.
5528250 5529661 Deal.
5539167 5541124 Hey, what's going on?
5541250 5542285 Security's here.
5542417 5543623 They're clearing everyone out.
5543750 5545286 They're not waking him up.
5545375 5547457 Whatever you do,<br />don't leave him alone.
5547542 5549184 What do you mean<br />they're not waking him up?
5549208 5551996 SENATE LEADER:<br />The voting period has ended.
5552083 5554165 The clerks have<br />tabulated the results.
5554292 5557125 The yeas are 63.
5557250 5558957 The nays are 22.
5559083 5561825 A majority of senators<br />have voted in the affirmative.
5561958 5564575 The Dreyfus Act<br />has been repealed
5564750 5565956 by Congress.
5566042 5567999 (applause over TV)
5570375 5571957 (phone rings)
5572042 5574158 God, you guys are slow,<br />like a bunch of girls.
5574292 5575327 This is Mattox.
5575458 5577074 <i>SELLARS:<br />Bennett's on board.</i>
5577167 5579158 It's about time.
5583333 5585574 Call it.
5585667 5587123 Get it done.
5587208 5589199 My pleasure.
5591625 5593616 (doorbell rings)
5597625 5598865 Mrs. Murphy...
5598958 5600494 You can come here<br />as much as you want.
5600625 5601956 You can threaten me.
5602083 5603518 You can sue me.<br />You can take my home.
5603542 5605309 But I am not gonna stop<br />till I see my husband.
5605333 5606619 Do you understand that?
5606750 5610038 Mr. Sellars would<br />very much like to see you.
5611250 5612786 Is Alex okay?
5612875 5614786 He has important information<br />to share with you.
5614917 5617329 Will you accompany me?
5618500 5620832 David.
5620958 5621958 We gotta go.
5622083 5623164 Can you grab your coat?
5623292 5624327 (phone rings)
5624458 5625823 Hey.
5625958 5627434 NORTON: I'm in the elevator,<br />on my way down.
5627458 5628994 I need access to the lab.
5629125 5630309 That's insane;<br />They're still here.
5630333 5631744 NORTON:<br />Distract them.
5631833 5633449 Okay.
5635000 5636000 |cannot...!
5636083 5638120 There's a lady in here<br />going hysterical.
5638250 5640268 She will not let us in;<br />She's got the code for the door.
5640292 5641476 I repeat:<br />She will not let us in.
5641500 5642851 Lady, you need to let us<br />in there now.
5642875 5644286 We have to get in there.
5644375 5645976 Are you not understanding<br />what I'm saying?
5646000 5647786 Do you want to be responsible<br />for the deaths
5647875 5648934 of everyone in this building?
5648958 5649958 Hey! Stop!
5650083 5652074 (panting)
5654167 5655167 Don't shoot.
5655208 5657575 Step outside.
5663625 5665411 Unlock the transmitter!
5665500 5667707 KIM:<br />Transmitter unlocked.
5674250 5676617 Send in Mrs. Murphy, please.
5676750 5678411 WOMAN (over intercom):<br />Right away, sir.
5680458 5682074 NORTON (voice-over):<br />Wake him up!
5682167 5685489 Alex! Alex!
5685625 5686625 Alex, it's Dr. Norton.
5686708 5688745 You have to wake up!
5688833 5690449 Alex, can you hear me?
5691667 5692907 These men are here to kill us.
5693000 5694456 They're here to kill us,
5694542 5696328 for Christ sakes!
5700875 5702786 SELLARS (voice-over):<br />Mrs. Murphy, last night,
5702875 5704661 Alex had a psychotic break.
5704792 5706749 He killed an unarmed colleague
5706833 5709074 and later suffered a seizure.
5709167 5711750 We did everything...
5711833 5713619 Everything... we could,
5713708 5715028 but the doctors<br />couldn't save him.
5716208 5717790 Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.
5717917 5719908 We're going to be making<br />the announcement shortly.
5720000 5722412 ROBOCOP (voice-over):<br />You shut me down.
5722500 5724116 I was about to get a confession.
5724250 5727618 Mattox shut you down.
5727708 5728914 I've removed your transmitter,
5729000 5730616 so he won't do it again.
5730750 5733788 Sellars can't afford<br />to wake you up.
5733875 5736367 He sent these guys<br />to pull the plug.
5736458 5738415 He wants you dead, Alex.
5738500 5740116 You understand?
5740250 5741768 SELLARS (voice-over):<br />Sorry. If there's anything
5741792 5743954 we can do for you and<br />David, we'll do it.
5744042 5746659 I want nothing from you.
5746792 5748328 I understand.
5748458 5750870 You stay out of our lives.
5752083 5753824 You and your company.
5753958 5755824 If that's what<br />you think is best.
5755958 5757665 There's one more thing.
5757792 5759999 I think it would be to<br />the benefit of everyone,
5760125 5761365 especially David,
5761458 5763790 if we kept this matter private.
5763875 5766833 We don't want to damage<br />Alex's legacy.
5768042 5769783 NORTON (voice-over):<br />Alex.
5769917 5770998 Alex!
5771125 5772331 I can fix this!
5772458 5773573 You lied to me.
5773667 5775453 You lied to my wife.
5775542 5777393 You're working for the people<br />that are trying to kill me.
5777417 5778601 You want me to<br />trust you, Doctor?
5778625 5780741 Alex, I can go to the press!
5780833 5784121 Alex, I can tell them<br />the whole story!
5784208 5786996 Alex!
5787125 5790083 Listen to me, please!
5790167 5791407 Alex!
5791500 5793491 Alex...!
5802250 5804332 (engine roaring)
5804458 5806199 What the hell...?
5807125 5808661 (tires squealing)
5811333 5812573 (passing car honking horn)
5812667 5814123 (engine revving)
5814250 5815559 Keep all our systems<br />at green light,
5815583 5817268 and for Christ sakes,<br />get Sellars on the phone.
5817292 5818157 MAN:<br />Roger that.
5818292 5821159 Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!
5821292 5823624 Look at this city.
5826000 5828287 So beautiful.
5828375 5830742 It's become so peaceful.
5833708 5836325 I wish...
5836458 5838790 I had some good news<br />for Detroit.
5838875 5840331 I have very sad news.
5840458 5841573 Despite our best efforts
5841667 5843749 to save him,
5843833 5846291 Alex Murphy passed away<br />just hours ago.

5861583 5862663 What are you talking about?

5864125 5865601 I need you to turn around<br />and go the other way.
5865625 5866726 Sir, there's a car<br />outside that's...
5866750 5867911 That area is locked down.
5868000 5869120 - Now go.<br />- What's happening?
5869208 5871119 I said go!

5903000 5904081 Mr. Sellars.
5904167 5905657 Apparently there's<br />a Clara Murphy
5905792 5906998 in the lobby.
5907125 5908581 Uh, Raymond, if she sees him,
5908667 5910476 - we are dead in the water.<br />- What do you want to do?
5910500 5912161 Bring Mrs. Murphy up here.
5912292 5913453 Yes, sir.

5916417 5918454 LEWIS (voice-over):<br />Norton said they may be
5918542 5919953 using drones for protection.
5920083 5922415 So whatever you do,<br />do not draw your weapons.

5958042 5959373 if I were you.

6117708 6119073 What's going on?
6119167 6121408 Mrs. Murphy, I want you<br />to listen to me carefully.
6121500 6123300 The organic part<br />of your husband Alex is dead.
6123333 6126325 The robotic part of him<br />is malfunctioning,
6126458 6127768 and he's shooting up<br />the building.
6127792 6129282 So we've got to get you<br />and your son
6129375 6130456 out of here right away.
6130542 6133330 I've got to take this call.
6133458 6135101 He just left the lobby,<br />and he's headed our way.
6135125 6136615 MATTOX:<br />Roger that, sir.
6136750 6137956 Don't shoot.
6138083 6139289 My robot. You just flank.
6139375 6141366 ...Got it.<br />—Tin Man!
6144083 6145448 Tin Man?
6145583 6148291 Tin Man.
6148375 6149615 Oh, there it is.
6149750 6151741 You look like crap.
6153958 6155448 What's the matter?
6155542 6156828 Can't shoot?
6156958 6158164 Huh?
6158292 6160829 What were you thinking?
6160958 6162414 This isn't a drill.
6162500 6163500 You're a robot.
6163625 6164786 I'm a red asset.
6164875 6165956 Wrote that myself.
6166083 6167824 What do you think?
6167958 6170996 Come on, Tin Man,<br />just pull the trigger.
6171125 6173116 Pull it.

6193542 6195624 Hey, listen...

6198292 6200158 Well, maybe a little.

6278667 6280032 Get out of the way.
6280125 6282036 - Alex, put down the gun.<br />- Clara,
6282125 6283605 take David<br />and get out of the way now!
6285333 6286744 Raymond Sellars,<br />you're under arrest
6286833 6288619 for the attempted murder<br />of a police officer.
6292042 6293248 Are you here to cuff me?
6293375 6294911 All right.
6295042 6297204 Go ahead, cuff me.
6297292 6299374 You can't.
6299458 6300789 You're not programmed that way.
6300917 6302203 If you go against the program,
6302292 6304124 the entire system<br />shuts down, so...
6304250 6306036 You don't even have a warrant.
6306125 6308018 - We'll overlook this little...<br />- Get down on the ground and put
6308042 6310143 - your hands behind your back.<br />- I-I'm just from Marketing.
6310167 6311287 - Now!<br />- Okay, yep, yep, yep.
6311333 6312573 Yep.
6312667 6314059 Alex, we need<br />to work together here.
6314083 6316074 Because I'm the only one
6316167 6318750 with the technology<br />to keep you alive.
6318917 6320908 Dead or alive,<br />you're coming with me.
6321000 6322911 (whirring)
6323000 6325708 - (clank)<br />- (groaning)
6326958 6328198 All right.
6328292 6330124 Weapon.
6330208 6331869 Alex, honestly,
6331958 6333414 I mean you no harm.
6333542 6334703 If I wanted to,
6334792 6336374 I could have killed you<br />along time ago.
6336458 6338018 I just aim this right<br />at your head and blow it off.
6338042 6339248 CLARA:<br />Sellars, please!
6339375 6340536 Don't!
6340625 6341976 I mean, if I wanted to,<br />I could just
6342000 6344241 aim this at your little family,
6344375 6346082 and I could just kill them too.
6346167 6347893 And really, there's nothing<br />you could do about it,
6347917 6349783 because, let's face it...
6349917 6351874 you're a robot.
6351958 6354666 Do you understand that?
6358167 6359202 Alex...
6362500 6364286 Dad!
6367208 6368573 CLARA (whispering):<br />Baby.
6368708 6370699 (whirring)
6374458 6376790 Hey...
6376917 6380205 Hey... everything's<br />gonna be all right.
6380333 6381744 (Clara and David crying)

6511875 6513081 NOVAK:<br />There's still no word
6513167 6517081 from Omnicorp<br />parent company, OCP.
6517167 6520535 And although the government says<br />they are rebuilding Alex Murphy,
6520625 6523208 rumors continue to swirl<br />about his condition.
6523292 6526455 But we have obtained<br />exclusive video
6526583 6528073 taken by cell phone
6528208 6530449 that shows the people of Detroit
6530583 6532745 may have Alex Murphy<br />back on the streets
6532875 6535242 sooner than they think.
6535375 6538697 The real tragedy here is that
6538792 6543116 our president chose<br />to uphold the Dreyfus Act.
6543250 6546743 Now, I have no doubt<br />he was manipulated
6546875 6548912 by our biased media
6549042 6552205 and by whistle-blower<br />Dennett Norton.
6552292 6556411 I acknowledge we know<br />less than we thought.
6556542 6560285 But I do believe<br />my research program is sound.
6561458 6563165 What I did With it...
6564375 6566207 ...was wrong.
6566292 6568124 The fact that<br />this mother (bleep)
6568250 6572073 Is not serving time<br />in some Federal penitentiary
6572208 6576156 is a huge, hot, heaping pile<br />of horse (bleep)!
6581500 6583457 Now I know some of you may think
6583583 6586371 that this kind<br />of thinking is dangerous
6586458 6588620 and these machines violate
6588750 6590411 your civil liberties.
6590542 6594365 Some of you even believe that<br />the use of these drones overseas
6594458 6596870 makes us the same kind
6596958 6598790 of bullying imperialists
6598917 6602239 that our forefathers<br />were trying to escape.
6602375 6605208 To you, I say,
6605375 6608743 stop whining!
6608875 6611913 America is now,
