28629 29762 - I'm starting a new life.
34134 37536 Up here where it's quiet and<br />clean among the redwoods.
38805 40806 And almost no one knows me.
78344 79745 Poor Jerry.
82348 85717 I had a nervous breakdown<br />after he left me.
89589 91557 They say I'm cured now.
94394 97463 But I still have<br />intrusive thoughts.
104471 108607 My therapist told me that<br />I'm not unusual at all.
109676 112544 People are abused<br />all over the world
112846 114446 every day
114814 116582 much worse than me
118384 119852 and they do fine.
165498 167599 - Your tail light's out, miss.
167601 170936 - Oh, thank you for<br />letting me know.
172705 175407 Are you gonna write me a ticket?
175409 179444 - I'll let ya go this time,<br />but make sure you get it fixed.
180813 182581 - Thank you, officer.
184184 185651 - You drive safely.
210243 213245 - When Jerry left<br />me, I devoured everything
213247 216582 I could about how to<br />get your man back.
217283 220452 According to the experts,<br />men are very fragile.
224490 228527 They can get crushed down if<br />you assert yourself in any way.
230496 232798 You have to be very tricky.
278544 279544 - Elaine?
279812 280612 Hi, I'm Trish.
280614 282714 - Hi, Trish, it's<br />nice to meet you.
282716 284549 - Oh, you're so pretty.
285551 286518 Oh, um, I didn't mean anything.
286520 288320 I'm married and everything.
288322 290589 - No, I didn't think anything.
290591 293892 - Well, let me help<br />you with your bags.
294560 295427 Is this all you've got?
295429 296528 - For now.
296530 298597 My art supplies are<br />being shipped over later.
298599 299831 - So you're an artist?
299833 300932 - Yes, I am.
301734 303001 - I'm an interior decorator.
303003 304369 - Oh, really?
304570 305570 - Yes.
312945 314780 That's how I met Barbara.
314782 317082 I decorated this apartment.
317784 319518 It was lucky I<br />still had the keys.
319520 323455 Barbara didn't exactly<br />know when she'd be back.
335702 337536 How do you know Barbara?
337538 339604 - We used to dance<br />together in San Francisco.
339606 340739 - Oh, really?
347880 350082 Well, I hope you<br />like the apartment.
350084 353051 It's a bit garish but<br />Barbara wanted it that way.
353053 356088 She had me take all of the<br />colors from the Thoth tarot deck
356090 358390 and she and her students did<br />a bunch of occult paintings
358392 359725 for me to hang.
360593 362761 She's into all that Wicca stuff.
368368 369634 Well, this is it.
373873 375841 - Oh, Trish, I love it.
376509 377809 It's just beautiful.
377811 378811 - Really?
379445 380512 Oh, I'm so glad.
381614 382881 I thought I may<br />have overdone it.
382883 385517 - Oh no, it's exactly my taste.
386552 387486 - You must be exhausted.
387488 387486 I'm sure you want to lie down.
387488 391390 - Actually, I was thinking<br />about getting a bite to eat.
391392 393492 Do you know of a<br />place around here?
393494 394893 - There's the<br />Victorian tea room.
394895 397496 We could go together, if<br />you don't mind the company.
397498 399431 - Oh, how fantastic.
399866 401400 Where can I freshen up?
401402 402968 - The bedroom is through there.
402970 405036 - I'll only be a moment.
438171 439971 - What a lovely room.
440506 441673 - Yes, isn't it?
441675 443442 I love Victoriana.
444610 446578 - Being here is like being<br />a Princess in a fairy tale.
446580 449481 - Do you have fairy<br />Princess fantasies, Elaine?
449483 450549 - Of course.
450551 450549 We may be grown<br />women, but underneath
450551 456621 we're just little girls<br />dreaming about being carried off
456623 459124 by a prince on a white horse.
459792 461560 - Yes, I suppose so.
461562 463595 It's ridiculous, isn't it?
469735 473238 - I don't think I've found<br />my prince charming yet,
473240 475574 but I think I found the formula.
475576 477042 You know, I've been<br />studying parapsychology
477044 481480 and I understand men so<br />much better than I used to.
483549 487786 If only I would have known<br />before what I know now.
490022 492891 Then Jerry would<br />have never left me.
492893 494125 - Who's Jerry?
494660 495894 - My ex-husband.
497597 501032 The day he left me was<br />the day that I died.
503603 506204 But then I was<br />reborn as a witch.
508508 511009 Barbara and Dan brought<br />me back to life.
511011 515247 They taught me everything I<br />know about magic and about men.
516282 518583 Men are like children.
519185 520986 They're very easy to please
522088 524523 as long as we give<br />them what they want.
563037 563996 - Where were we?
563997 569334 Oh, men, you said we need<br />to give them what they want.
569969 571349 Well, what do men want?
572638 575774 - Just a pretty woman to<br />love and to take care of them
575776 578310 and to make them feel like a man
579312 580245 and to give them total freedom
580247 582647 in whatever they wanna do or be.
583249 585116 - But what about what we want?
585118 586751 How are we going to<br />be equals with men
586753 590322 if we keep catering<br />to all of their needs?
591691 594693 - I think that if you want<br />love, you have to give love.
595795 598897 Giving men sex is a way of<br />unlocking their love potential.
600266 603268 - You sound as if you'd been<br />brainwashed by the patriarchy.
603270 607706 Your whole self-worth is<br />wrapped up in pleasing a man.
608808 610875 I'll admit, I used<br />sex to get this,
612244 614312 but I'm not proud of it.
615381 617616 A whole world doesn't<br />revolve around a man's needs.
617618 619684 If I gave Richard sex<br />every time he wanted it,
619686 621019 I'd be a wreck.
621354 622387 - Poor Richard.
623956 627659 He loves you and he wants<br />you and you torture him.
629629 632030 You have to give<br />a man his fantasy.
632032 634899 - His fantasy?
634901 636334 - Yes, his fantasy.
638938 641740 But what I'm really<br />interested in
642174 643775 is love.
645144 648146 You might say I'm<br />addicted to love.
649248 652283 I wonder if all<br />women feel that way?
653419 655854 - Well, it depends on<br />what you mean by love.
655856 657756 A husband isn't<br />a prince, Elaine,
657758 660158 and life isn't a fairy tale.
661027 662160 We have to face that fact.
662162 663162 - Why?
663863 665063 Maybe life could be a fairy tale
665065 667165 if you pleased<br />your husband more.
667167 669901 - I don't<br />need to please Richard.
669903 672037 Richard loves me for myself.
672039 673104 - Of course.
673106 676274 Maybe you did find<br />your prince charming.
676276 677676 - Perhaps I did.
690823 691823 - Guess who.
692925 695293 - Richard, what<br />are you doing here?
696830 698063 This tea room is<br />for ladies only.
698065 700231 - Oh, I went to<br />visit you at work
700233 700231 and Julie said you were here.
700233 704069 I thought we could<br />have lunch together.
704071 707305 - Well, that's very sweet,<br />but I've already had my lunch.
707307 709174 Oh, uh, Richard, this is Elaine.
709176 712243 Elaine, this is my<br />husband, Richard.
713412 714979 - I've heard so much<br />about you, Richard.
714981 717415 - Nothing too horrible, I hope.
717417 718950 - On the contrary.
857256 859324 - Goddess, please,
861393 865864 send me a beautiful, sweet man
865866 873438 to love me as I love him.
873440 875373 To love me, love me,
880446 881446 love me,
883315 884315 love me,
885985 887051 love me,
888153 889220 love me,
890322 891389 love me,
892626 893892 love me.
914146 915513 Hi, are you Wendy?
916315 918416 - Yes, what can I do for you?
919151 920218 - I'm Elaine.
920419 920418 We spoke on the phone.
920420 924322 I make natural soaps<br />and candles and things.
924324 925924 - Elaine, right.
926392 927558 Thanks for coming by.
928427 929394 Mind if I have a look?
929396 930461 - Please do.
937937 939404 - These are nice.
943275 944342 Really nice.
946145 949047 I think these will<br />do well in the store.
949049 950481 - Then you'll take them?
950483 954485 - Let's start with these<br />and see how they do.
957690 960725 If these sell in the next<br />week or two, I'll order more.
960727 961727 Sound good?
962328 963394 - Yes, fantastic.
964263 965396 Thank you, Wendy.
965731 966731 - Sure, Elaine.
967333 968333 Bright blessings.
1008107 1010608 - People always<br />ask me why I'm a witch.
1010610 1014712 I tell them it's because I<br />wanna have magical powers.
1014714 1017015 But it's not like it sounds.
1017017 1021285 All it is is using your<br />will to get what you want.
1056655 1057655 - Hi.
1058657 1059657 - Hi.
1061360 1064362 - It's a beautiful day.
1064364 1065530 - Yes, it is.
1066832 1069400 I love to be out in<br />nature on days like this.
1069402 1071302 - Oh, you like nature?
1071637 1072637 - Very much.
1073439 1076374 You seem like a nature type too.
1077443 1080244 I'll bet you like to<br />spend time in the woods.
1080246 1081579 - That's right.
1082114 1083114 How'd you know?
1083348 1084582 - I can just tell.
1085384 1087151 Nature is where your heart is.
1088287 1091255 City and people can get<br />to be too much for you.
1092424 1095560 - Whuh, that is a lot to get<br />from someone in a few seconds.
1097262 1099330 - I'm talented that way.
1100399 1103267 - Well, you're right<br />about the city.
1104336 1106137 In fact, I have a<br />house out in the woods
1106139 1108206 about an hour from here.
1109475 1111442 I like to go there whenever<br />I can to, you know,
1111444 1113377 just think and read.
1115380 1116881 - Do you take your<br />wife up there?
1116883 1119684 - No.
1120419 1121552 I'm not married.
1122821 1124388 - Well, you might at<br />least take a girl up there
1124390 1125590 once in a while.
1126458 1128493 - I do.
1128495 1130394 I do, once in a while.
1131530 1133331 - You wanna take a<br />girl up there now?
1137402 1138903 What do you mean?
1140539 1142473 - Well, I'm new in town
1142475 1145910 and I haven't seen much<br />of the nature around here.
1145912 1148513 I'll make you a nice dinner.
1149414 1153184 - Yes, yes, okay, sure.
1153752 1155853 Uh, my car is right over there.
1156822 1157822 - Okay.
1159291 1160291 Let's go.
1209241 1211475 You know what I'd<br />like to do right now?
1217382 1219383 I'd like to make love<br />right here in the car
1219385 1221586 just like we were kids.
1223755 1225656 - Wait, wait.
1229861 1231295 You want some?
1232965 1234298 - What is it?
1234800 1236601 - Something I made.
1243642 1244642 - Mm.
1245644 1249013 Oh, wo, ho, ho, ho,<br />that is, that is strong.
1250415 1251482 - Finish it.
1262361 1264729 - Oh.
1269768 1271936 - No, Wayne, Wayne, stop.
1273772 1274772 Not here.
1275474 1276674 Let's go inside.
1289554 1290921 This is beautiful.
1296028 1297928 I'll start the dinner.
1340439 1341539 - Wow.
1348447 1350448 This looks delicious.
1353385 1354452 - To nature.
1373405 1375940 - This is really nice, isn't it?
1376775 1378409 I like to come up here a lot
1378411 1381078 at the end of the<br />semester to unwind.
1381080 1382580 - Are you a teacher?
1382582 1385116 - Yeah, I teach<br />at the university.
1385118 1387385 - Oh, what do you teach?
1387986 1389787 - English and French literature
1389789 1392623 with a focus on<br />the 18th century.
1393759 1395693 - So, you must be<br />quite a libertine.
1395695 1396927 - A libertine?
1398029 1399697 Why would you say that?
1399699 1400998 - Oh, you know.
1402467 1404602 All of the dangerous<br />liaisons, Benny hill stuff.
1404604 1406070 Not to mention Casanova.
1406072 1409607 - Well, there<br />were a lot of books written
1409609 1411442 in the 18th century.
1411444 1412910 - Well, is it true?
1413578 1415012 Are you a libertine?
1416415 1417415 - Yes I am.
1418417 1419583 I love women.
1420085 1421819 Does that bother you?
1421821 1423587 - On the contrary.
1428193 1429193 Oh, hmm,
1431463 1433564 I feel strange, dizzy.
1439037 1441806 What was in that<br />drink you gave me?
1441808 1445810 - Organic berries, vodka,<br />hallucinogenic herbs.
1447212 1449213 - Hallucinogenic herbs?
1451484 1452583 Oh, baby.
1453051 1454652 You are really wild.
1460125 1464161 - Would you mind if I made<br />myself more comfortable?
1464163 1465529 - Not at all.
1490121 1491522 - What the hell?
1492858 1493858 Your coat.
1494860 1495860 It's so bright.
1500532 1502867 - I always line my clothing.
1503535 1505536 - You have two selves.
1506671 1509974 Dark and quiet that<br />you show the world.
1511109 1513177 Who do you give that to?
1514579 1515646 The rainbow?
1516248 1518816 - I give the rainbow to you.
1520519 1521519 Right now.
1546111 1548913 - Oh.
1549714 1553884 - Oh.
1563595 1564695 - Huh!
1565230 1566230 Oh god.
1567132 1568132 Oh, Elaine.
1570201 1571268 Look at you.
1572704 1574305 - You can make love to me now.
1645911 1647378 - Aw, okay.
1728294 1730027 - What is it, Wayne?
1730495 1732062 What is it, baby?
1733498 1736433 - Oh, Elaine, I feel so strange.
1738937 1742272 - It's all right,<br />you're with me, shhh.
1746044 1747044 - Elaine.
1749414 1753450 No woman has ever given<br />herself like that to me before.
1754452 1756520 - Life has been tough, huh?
1757188 1758255 - Yeah, in a way.
1763094 1766363 You're not like any<br />other woman I've met.
1767232 1768332 No games, no agendas.
1770435 1773504 You just seem to<br />take life as it is.
1775373 1778108 - Is there any other<br />way to take life?
1778110 1780944 - Well, the women<br />I've been with,
1782313 1784248 they all want you to make<br />a bunch of promises to 'em
1784250 1786817 as soon as you sleep with 'em.
1788286 1790821 But, how can you commit to someone<br />that you don't even know?
1790823 1791823 It's crazy.
1792357 1793891 - I know, baby.
1795059 1796059 I know.
1797562 1801999 - I never thought I wanted<br />to be tied down to anybody.
1803368 1806537 But it's just 'cause no<br />one was ever quite right.
1807438 1810908 All the women that I'm<br />attracted to physically
1811509 1813477 they're never bright enough.
1814879 1817981 And all the bright ones are<br />homely and don't arouse me.
1819083 1820984 - That seems like<br />quite a problem.
1821486 1824388 - It is.
1825390 1827991 I feel my whole life as a loner,
1828593 1830961 thinkin' I didn't need anybody.
1832864 1834932 But now I'm not so sure.
1835567 1836567 Oh, Elaine,
1838303 1842339 I have never felt real<br />love like this before.
1843508 1846944 - You're just having a<br />lot of emotions right now.
1847312 1849546 - Oh.
1850448 1851615 Elaine, I'm scared.
1854619 1858455 I'm not used to feeling<br />things so strongly.
1859357 1861024 I can't take it,<br />I can't take it.
1861026 1863427 Oh.
1865196 1869433 Elaine, I'm sick.
1870101 1871101 I'm sick.
1872503 1874404 - Hey, it's all right.
1877141 1878308 I've got you.
1878943 1879943 I love you.
1880479 1884281 And I'll always be here for you.
1886317 1888218 Try to get some sleep.
1897428 1899463 - Elaine.
1903001 1904902 Elaine, where are you?
1906304 1908372 Elaine, where are you?
1913044 1914444 - What a pussy.
1915481 1916546 What a baby.
1917382 1918649 I thought I'd found a real man,
1918651 1920651 but he's just like<br />a little girl.
1920653 1922419 - Elaine!
1923521 1924621 - No one was ever there for me
1924623 1927057 when I was crying my heart out.
1928394 1930527 No one ever comforted me.
1931296 1932296 No one.
2006404 2008305 - Good morning, Wayne.
2009140 2010273 - Hi, Elaine.
2016581 2018415 - Here, drink this.
2028793 2032396 - I had such horrible<br />dreams last night.
2033431 2035399 - What did you<br />dream about, baby.
2036501 2038035 - I dreamt that I<br />was calling your name
2038037 2039736 and you didn't answer.
2041339 2044174 I kept calling and calling,<br />but I couldn't find you.
2047245 2050247 Oh, Elaine, you<br />love me, don't you?
2052517 2053583 - Of course, I love you.
2053585 2057821 - Oh god, oh god, Elaine.
2063428 2064694 - Are you hungry?
2066631 2068765 - I don't know what I am.
2069567 2071601 - Well, try to get some sleep.
2072737 2073737 - Elaine.
2075606 2077107 Don't leave me.
2077708 2079476 - I'm not going anywhere, baby.
2079478 2081111 I'll be right here.
2108272 2109573 Wayne, wake up.
2110108 2111108 It's late.
2113511 2114511 Wayne.
2115346 2117347 Wayne, baby, wake up.
2118783 2119783 Wake up.
2121219 2122219 Wayne.
2197728 2200497 Tampons aren't gross.
2200499 2203800 Women bleed and that's<br />a beautiful thing.
2205403 2209206 Do you know that most men have<br />ever even seen a used tampon?
2215513 2218348 Part of me can be<br />with Wayne now.
2219784 2220784 Always.
2223621 2225855 I don't really mind death.
2226657 2228325 I've buried people before.
2229727 2231261 People I really cared about.
2236434 2239936 In the end we're all<br />just compost anyway.
2241439 2243440 Everything regenerates.
2246844 2249512 I'd like to come back as a cat.
2250581 2253917 I've been so depressed<br />since my cat died.
2255453 2258488 His name was Greymalkin,<br />but he was black and white.
2259490 2261591 He was my best friend.
2280478 2282846 - I give the rainbow to you.
2285750 2286750 Right now.
2387485 2388518 Just a minute.
2396160 2397427 Oh hi Trish.
2397762 2398762 Come on in.
2399397 2400397 - Hey, Elaine.
2400765 2401998 You look gorgeous.
2402000 2403533 I love what you've<br />done with your hair.
2403535 2404601 - Thank you.
2405436 2405435 What's up, honey?
2405437 2407771 - Well, I haven't been<br />able to reach you,
2407773 2408938 so I thought I'd come over
2408940 2410940 to see if everything<br />was all right.
2410942 2411942 - I'm fine.
2412410 2413510 Really.
2414712 2416513 Can I offer you something?
2416515 2419082 I just made some tea and cake.
2419750 2421017 - Just tea, thank you.
2433597 2435098 - Cream and sugar?
2435100 2437534 - No, I'm fine, thank you.
2453083 2455919 So, what have you<br />been so busy with?
2455921 2457153 A man, I hope.
2457855 2459155 - Yes, it was a man.
2460524 2462559 But, it didn't work out.
2463093 2463960 - I'm sorry.
2463962 2467697 - Yes, it's a shame<br />and I really liked him.
2470234 2472168 I thought that he was the one.
2472170 2474237 - Well, maybe next time.
2475706 2478208 - Are you sure you<br />won't have some cake?
2478210 2479943 - Oh, no, thank you.
2481545 2484614 I just came over to check up<br />on you and to say good bye.
2484616 2485616 - Good bye?
2486951 2488651 Why, where are you going?
2488653 2492722 - Oh, just to Dallas for<br />a furniture convention.
2493491 2495225 - Is Richard going with you?
2495227 2496926 - No, it's just a business trip.
2496928 2501097 Richard will have to fend<br />for himself for awhile.
2535633 2538101 - Sam, give me two<br />whiskeys on the rocks.
2538103 2539736 - Sure thing, Jane.
2541272 2542972 You see the papers today?
2542974 2543974 - No, why?
2544975 2547010 - They found a body<br />in the eel river.
2547012 2548012 - A murder?
2548646 2549646 - Maybe.
2550215 2554050 They found a symbol<br />carved in his chest.
2555319 2556619 Here.
2558322 2561558 - It's a pentagram.
2561560 2563793 - It's them witches again.
2564929 2567630 - That's what I was<br />thinking too, Lyle.
2569567 2572602 - So yeah, Barbara,<br />that's everything.
2573971 2576306 After Jerry died, the cops<br />wouldn't stop harassing me.
2576308 2578675 They couldn't prove anything.
2578677 2581611 They actually thought<br />that I killed him.
2581613 2583279 Can you believe it?
2584648 2588618 Anyways, San Francisco got<br />to be a really bad trip
2588620 2589719 after you left.
2591188 2593990 That's when I remembered you<br />had that extra apartment.
2593992 2595992 - Well, it was perfect timing.
2595994 2598361 I'm just sorry I wasn't<br />here to greet you.
2598363 2599596 That's all right.
2599598 2601698 Trish has been lovely.
2602633 2604267 And I've been getting<br />a lot of artwork done.
2604269 2606803 But I had this<br />experience last weekend
2606805 2608871 that really shook me up.
2610841 2612675 - Why, what happened?
2613811 2615745 - Well, I met this<br />great-looking guy.
2615747 2618114 And I used love magic on him.
2618116 2620750 Then he got really weird on me.
2622052 2625355 All these emotions started<br />flowing out of him.
2627291 2628858 Then he got really
2630127 2631127 sick.
2632396 2634397 - Well, guys can't handle<br />their emotions too well.
2634399 2637266 That's why they don't<br />like heavy conversations.
2637268 2639302 It was probably just<br />too much for him.
2639304 2643406 All the love and the great<br />sex that you were giving him.
2643408 2645908 - I guess that's what it was.
2646377 2648011 But, I don't know.
2649113 2651214 - Honey, you have<br />to be more careful.
2651216 2652715 Maybe you shouldn't be<br />messing with love spells
2652717 2655184 in the first place, you know.
2657254 2659055 - Merry meet, Elaine.
2660024 2662191 - Bright blessings Gahan.
2681011 2683880 - I heard you<br />discussing love spells.
2683882 2685815 You do have to be<br />careful, Elaine.
2685817 2689686 Love spells never work the<br />way you think they will.
2689688 2693189 But on a lighter note, it's<br />wonderful to see you, Elaine.
2693191 2695725 What's it been now, a year?
2696427 2699362 We must celebrate this<br />reunion of dear friends.
2699364 2701764 Thank you goddess everywhere
2703701 2706302 for the blessings that we share.
2706304 2708438 - Blessed be, Variah.
2710974 2712442 - Go home, witches.
2714111 2715111 Go home.
2716280 2717480 - Just ignore them.
2717482 2719282 They're always<br />giving us trouble.
2719284 2722018 - I didn't know this town<br />was hostile to witches.
2722020 2724320 - Well, it's certainly<br />not San Francisco.
2724322 2726789 But it's not bad<br />for a small town.
2726791 2728391 Not all of them<br />embrace our methods
2728393 2730460 of practicing witchcraft.
2730462 2734297 But, I don't see why we<br />ought to be so uptight now.
2734299 2737500 Back in the day, we<br />all made love freely
2739036 2741838 and put up Baphomet posters<br />and no one was dogmatic
2741840 2745408 about whether they were a witch<br />or a satanist or thelemites,
2745410 2748411 or a druid or a<br />wiccan or whatever.
2749246 2750379 And it was fun.
2751116 2754484 But our classes and circles<br />have been very popular.
2760758 2762258 - What have you been teaching?
2762260 2764961 - Let's see, I've got a<br />new class on Sidral magic
2764963 2768297 and Barbara's got a new<br />class on organite alchemy.
2768299 2770867 Otherwise, we're still<br />teaching the staples,
2770869 2773469 energy grounding,<br />earth-based spirituality,
2773471 2775304 pagan arts and crafts,
2775306 2779542 candle work, the spellcraft<br />master class, ancient mysticism,
2780878 2783479 herbs and spices, and<br />sex magic, of course.
2784481 2787116 - Oh, are you still<br />teaching that?
2788418 2791254 - Yes, in fact, we've invited<br />some girls here tonight
2791256 2795324 for a seminar about the<br />power of sexual dancing.
2796527 2800163 Dancing is such a powerful<br />thing for women and girls.
2800831 2802431 - Are you still dancing?
2802433 2804367 - Yeah, some of us dance<br />here on amateur night.
2804369 2805568 You should come.
2808172 2809205 - Hi, Barbara.
2809207 2810207 Hi, Gahan.
2810574 2811841 Sorry we're late.
2811843 2815978 - Hello lovely ladies,<br />please have a seat.
2817447 2821150 Elaine, this is star<br />and her sister moon.
2822152 2823386 They're our students<br />for tonight.
2823388 2825521 Girls, this is our<br />dear friend Elaine.
2825523 2826523 - Hi.
2827157 2828157 - Hi.
2829126 2830493 - I was just pointing<br />out that dancing
2830495 2833396 is a powerful thing<br />for women and girls.
2833398 2835164 We asked you to<br />meet us here tonight
2835166 2837533 so you could learn about that.
2839536 2842872 Do you see how<br />powerful that girl is?
2844007 2847009 These men would do<br />anything for her.
2848345 2851113 Wouldn't you like to have<br />that power yourselves?
2851615 2853382 Then let us begin.
2854551 2858020 All witches need to figure<br />out where their power lies.
2858022 2861090 And we feel that a<br />woman's greatest power
2861092 2862992 lies in her sexuality.
2864361 2867930 We don't view this power as<br />satanic or anti-feminist,
2869233 2872401 but as a celebration of<br />woman as a natural creature.
2873871 2877106 An earthly body, a spiritual<br />essence, and a womb.
2879343 2882078 - The whole history of<br />witchcraft is interwoven
2882080 2884981 with the fear of<br />female sexuality.
2886316 2888150 They burned us at the<br />stake because they feared
2888152 2891454 the erotic feelings<br />we illicited in them.
2891456 2894590 Later, they used marriage<br />to hold us in bondage
2894592 2899028 and made us into servants,<br />whores, and fantasy dolls
2899630 2902031 never asking us what we wanted.
2903166 2905468 - They teach us that a<br />normative human being
2905470 2908371 is a hyper-rationalist,<br />stoic male
2909506 2912241 and that women's emotions<br />and intuitions are illnesses
2912243 2914143 that need to be cured.
2915312 2918514 And they believe that men<br />and women are different
2918516 2922485 and that true equality<br />lies in that difference.
2923987 2925621 - We strive for male/female<br />polarity and to regain
2925623 2927390 our primal power as goddesses.
2929227 2931494 We need to teach<br />men how to love us
2931496 2934163 using ways they can understand.
2934965 2936499 So goddesses, use perfume,
2937401 2939535 wear high heels and makeup,
2940671 2943973 learn to dress your<br />hair in attractive ways,
2943975 2948110 display flesh artfully,<br />and know what to conceal.
2949012 2951080 Be a mother and a lover.
2952416 2956352 Stand your ground, but always<br />let the man feel like a man.
2959222 2962358 - Use sex magic to<br />destroy his fear of you
2962360 2965995 and to open his heart to<br />the floodgates of love.
2965997 2969498 Only then will he begin to<br />see you as a human being
2969500 2972268 with all of your inner beauty.
2973337 2974470 Then, when his heart<br />is open to love,
2974472 2977573 you may do with<br />him what you will.
2998362 3001364 - I love you, Elaine.
3002165 3003566 You know that, don't you?
3006036 3007636 I love you very much.
3011008 3013542 But you need to be more careful.
3016246 3019482 Dinner was late three<br />times this week.
3020384 3022551 And that house is<br />a total pigsty.
3023653 3027023 Do you know that I<br />found an old hot dog
3027624 3029225 under the bed this morning?
3032429 3034597 And why don't you<br />ever brush your hair?
3034599 3039035 You need to take better care<br />of yourself and of the house.
3040203 3043172 I'm embarrassed to<br />have people over.
3044241 3045574 I've been really<br />patient up until now,
3045576 3048477 but you need to<br />step up your game.
3051081 3053816 - I have a<br />crazy bitch for a daughter.
3053818 3056652 What?
3057621 3059321 You're not crazy.
3060524 3062525 Well, if you're not<br />crazy then you're stupid.
3062527 3063459 Which is it?
3063461 3065694 Are you crazy or are you stupid?
3065696 3068130 And you could lose a few pounds.
3068132 3070499 You're looking a little fatty.
3073438 3077673 - Oh my god, Elaine,<br />you've lost so much weight.
3078442 3080509 You have such a hot body now.
3081411 3084513 Do you like it when I<br />touch you like this?
3084515 3085681 Or like this?
3089286 3090686 I wanna make you come.
3095126 3097359 - Don't be frightened, Elaine.
3097361 3099328 I would never hurt you.
3100130 3101730 I'm not the big, bad wolf.
3102866 3106535 You need to have perfect<br />love and perfect trust.
3144708 3147576 - Hast thou the courage<br />to make the assay?
3147578 3151814 - I have two words, perfect<br />love and perfect trust.
3170433 3173669 - Assist me to erect<br />the ancient altar
3174771 3177239 at which in days<br />past all worshiped.
3178909 3182478 From the old times, a<br />woman was the altar.
3183813 3186882 And the sacred place was<br />the point within the center
3186884 3190486 of the circle, the<br />origin of all things.
3193623 3196392 Therefore, should we adore it.
3226723 3228891 - Good morning, sergeant Griff.
3228893 3231227 Congratulations<br />on your promotion.
3231229 3232528 - Thanks, Connie.
3233396 3234797 Is there any coffee.
3235599 3236865 - Yeah, I just made some.
3236867 3239602 I made it just the<br />way you like it.
3240570 3242605 - Is there anything<br />you don't do well?
3242607 3246609 - Why don't you try me<br />sometime and find out?
3251548 3253549 - How's the coffee, Steve?
3253551 3254850 - Uh, too strong.
3257587 3259722 - Well, I like it strong.
3260857 3263525 Man's gotta stay awake<br />on the job after all.
3263527 3266929 - Why, have you been<br />keeping late nights?
3266931 3267931 - Maybe so.
3272002 3273802 - But, now that<br />you've been promoted,
3273804 3276872 maybe you ought to start<br />thinking about settling down.
3276874 3278641 - Me, you kidding?
3284748 3288584 - Sergeant meadows, a<br />lady's here to see you.
3289452 3289451 - I'm Shelly Curtis.
3289453 3294490 I phoned about Wayne Peters,<br />the teacher who disappeared.
3295358 3296458 - Yes, of course.
3297060 3298827 Have a seat, miss Curtis.
3300864 3304433 You say you think Mr. Peters<br />might have been kidnapped?
3304435 3307736 - Yes, no one's seen<br />him for two weeks.
3308805 3311573 I went by his house and<br />the mail's piled up.
3312642 3314677 We had lunch the<br />day he disappeared.
3316046 3319081 I saw him drive away with a<br />strange woman near the Plaza.
3319083 3322084 - Do you have any idea where<br />he might have gone with her?
3322086 3323485 - Wayne used to spend weekends
3323487 3326588 up in a cabin he<br />had in the woods.
3328091 3329958 He used to take dates there.
3361591 3364893 - Oh, Jesus.
3386082 3387649 - Hey Griff, look.
3389152 3390152 - Good lord.
3399529 3400763 - What the hell is this?
3402733 3404066 - I don't know.
3411941 3413575 We're going to<br />have to dig, Steve.
3413577 3414577 - I know.
3422018 3423898 I think you should go<br />back to the house, Shelly.
3449546 3450546 - Mmm, mmm,
3455452 3458153 this cake is<br />absolutely fantastic.
3458822 3460088 And what a great dinner.
3460090 3461156 - Thank you.
3461758 3463158 I enjoy cooking.
3464561 3467229 Hope you don't mind<br />my calling you.
3467231 3470232 Sometimes it's so<br />hard to be alone.
3470767 3471633 - Not at all.
3471635 3477105 I get a little lonely, too,<br />when Trisha is out of town.
3484147 3486215 - How long have you<br />and Trish been married?
3486217 3488650 - 10 years this September.
3488985 3490052 - 10 years?
3491488 3493021 It's really amazing.
3494958 3499194 No one has ever loved me the<br />way you love Trish, no one.
3506536 3508570 - What about your husband?
3509572 3511139 - My husband never loved me.
3511141 3514276 He couldn't wait to<br />get away from me.
3515011 3516078 - I'm sorry.
3525622 3529858 Sometimes I think Trish would<br />like to get away from me, too.
3530627 3531693 - Poor baby.
3533096 3534696 Poor, poor baby.
3564961 3567629 So, tell me, what turns you on?
3569566 3573335 - What turns me on?
3574604 3576772 Wow, no one's ever<br />asked me that before.
3576774 3577940 Let me think.
3580176 3582978 You know what<br />really turns me on?
3583580 3584580 Flying.
3584881 3585881 - Flying?
3586249 3588150 - Yeah, flying a plane.
3589252 3591053 You don't know what<br />kinda high it is.
3591055 3594022 You're soarin' up<br />there above everything.
3594024 3595591 You're in control.
3596259 3597693 - Oh, how fantastic.
3598728 3599728 - It really is.
3601264 3605100 It's the only time I feel<br />really clear about things.
3606302 3609671 Sometimes I look at my life<br />and I wonder how I got here.
3614043 3615644 I feel like my life<br />is slipping away
3615646 3618113 and there's so many<br />things I haven't done.
3618115 3619181 - Like what?
3619183 3621216 - I've never had any<br />sort of love affairs
3621218 3623385 or gotten into any mischief.
3624921 3626989 I used to watch those<br />old Steve McQueen movies,
3626991 3630225 you know, the ones where<br />they'd rob a bank or something,
3630227 3631893 and I'd fantasize that<br />I was one of those
3631895 3636131 crazy kinda gangsters with a<br />sexy, messed up girl on my arm.
3637400 3641303 Or those westerns, when<br />they'd shoot up a town
3642405 3644806 and then go visit the<br />local prostitutes.
3644808 3646842 It's sounds stupid, I know.
3646844 3648310 - No, it doesn't.
3650380 3651780 It's very sweet.
3653716 3654716 - Really?
3656719 3658720 Trish doesn't think so.
3659856 3662324 She just rolls her eyes<br />when I talk like this.
3662326 3666261 - That's because she<br />doesn't understand you.
3667063 3668797 I understand you perfectly.
3670800 3671800 - You do?
3672235 3673235 - Of course.
3674804 3677873 You wanna have a<br />sordid love affair.
3678941 3681710 You wanna get into<br />some mischief.
3737000 3738000 - Uh.
3755818 3756818 - Ho!
3784347 3785380 Who are you?
3786249 3788383 What are you doing to me?
3789018 3790418 - I'm the love witch.
3791921 3795323 I'm your ultimate fantasy.
3795325 3796858 - That's right.
3799129 3800129 That's right.
3807203 3809404 - Steve, I'm going out<br />to see that witch doctor.
3809406 3810406 - Who?
3810973 3812207 - Professor king.
3812209 3814442 He specializes in black<br />magic and witchcraft.
3814444 3815844 He might be able to help me
3815846 3817312 identify some of<br />the items we found.
3817314 3818446 - It's great.
3819248 3820482 Did you get the lab report?
3820484 3823852 - Yeah, yeah, it looks<br />like heart failure.
3825221 3827222 But the toxicology report<br />showed traces of jimsonweed
3827224 3831459 also known as devil's weed, a<br />highly toxic hallucinogenic.
3832094 3833461 - It's unbelievable.
3834463 3834462 You want me to come with you?
3834464 3838266 - No, this will only<br />take a few minutes.
3838268 3840969 Can you order me a Turkey<br />and avocado on whole wheat?
3840971 3842337 - Mustard, Mayo?
3843005 3844406 - Yeah and Cole slaw.
3845107 3845941 Thanks.
3845943 3846943 - Done.
3855518 3859087 - Ah, sergeant meadows, sorry<br />to have kept you waiting.
3859089 3861456 - Glad to meet you, professor.
3864327 3867362 Professor, this is the<br />bottle we found in a grave
3867364 3871466 of Wayne Peters, the one<br />you read about in the paper.
3871468 3873134 - Interesting, yes.
3873970 3876471 Just as I thought.
3876473 3879374 The contents indicate<br />that it's a witch bottle.
3879376 3880375 - A witch bottle?
3880377 3881543 - Yes, witches used to make them
3881545 3884312 for protection against curses.
3884947 3887916 They'd take something personal<br />like bodily fluids or hair
3887918 3889584 along with herbs<br />and something sharp
3889586 3894022 like pins or broken glass<br />to scare away evil spirits.
3894924 3896157 Witch bottles have often been<br />found buried in the hearse
3896159 3897492 of very old houses.
3897494 3900462 - Would it be safe to assume<br />that the person who made this
3900464 3901529 was a witch?
3902198 3903465 - It's very likely.
3903467 3905567 Witchcraft, long dormant<br />in civilized places,
3905569 3908203 has taken root again in cities.
3908205 3910238 There have several<br />rituals per year.
3910240 3914476 One of them, Samhain,<br />corresponds of our Halloween.
3914944 3918280 Other rituals celebrate<br />summer solstice, Litha,
3918282 3922183 or the winter solstice,<br />which they call Imolg.
3925421 3928189 Here the members of a coven<br />kiss the devil's behind
3928191 3931092 in a mockery of<br />Christian rituals.
3932662 3936264 Here, a satanic cult<br />sacrifices a child.
3937333 3939067 - Does this stuff<br />really go on today?
3939069 3940302 - Yes, indeed.
3940304 3944172 Those who practice human<br />sacrifice are the black witches
3944174 3947142 who perform blood rituals<br />to gain demonic powers
3947144 3950345 and to bind their members<br />together in secrecy.
3950347 3952681 Law has been trying to root<br />out these cults for decades
3952683 3954983 but they've been unsuccessful.
3954985 3957152 Then there are the<br />white witches or Wiccans
3957154 3959421 who commune in nature<br />in the healing spirit
3959423 3962590 and who have a strict law<br />that forbids harming others.
3962592 3965026 Every city and rural<br />village today has pockets
3965028 3966494 of both black and white witches
3966496 3969164 who practice the ancient rites.
4000062 4004299 - I invoke and call upon<br />thee, mighty mother of us all.
4005701 4010138 I invoke thee to descend upon<br />the body of this thy servant
4011374 4012607 and priestess.
4014643 4017312 - Of the mother<br />darksome and divine
4017314 4019748 here I charge you in this sign.
4022485 4026087 - Listen to the words<br />of the great mother.
4028291 4031526 She, who of old, who<br />was also called Artemis,
4031528 4034529 Aphrodite, Ceridwyn,<br />Diana, Isis,
4037400 4039467 and by many other names.
4043040 4045440 - Whenever ye have<br />need of anything,
4045442 4049477 then ye shall assemble in some<br />secret place and adore me,
4050346 4052747 who am queen of all witches.
4054083 4057419 There shall ye assemble,<br />ye who are fain to learn
4057421 4058486 all sorcery.
4059822 4064225 Behold all acts of love and<br />pleasure are my rituals.
4065361 4068296 Behold I have been with<br />thee from the beginning
4069365 4072467 and I am that which is<br />attained at the end of desire.
4095091 4096091 - Arise.
4137700 4139534 - You're looking a little<br />tense tonight, love.
4139536 4141336 What's the matter?
4142505 4146508 - Oh nothing, just my usual<br />roller coaster love life.
4147510 4148843 - Well, have a drink and relax.
4148845 4152614 Nothing's that dire,<br />at least not for you.
4153782 4156818 It's an entirely different<br />story for your victims.
4158521 4159654 - What victims?
4159656 4163525 - There's no need to play<br />miss innocent with me, dearie.
4163527 4165460 - Please, don't touch me.
4171367 4172734 - Bright blessings, Barbara.
4172736 4174335 - Merry meet, Elaine.
4174337 4175436 How's it going?
4176572 4177539 - I'm back in the<br />dating pool again.
4177541 4178740 - What happened?
4178742 4181709 I thought you were crazy about<br />that new guy you were seeing,
4181711 4183311 the married man.
4183779 4185380 - No, I broke it off.
4186448 4188917 He just became really<br />obsessive, morose,
4189952 4192654 and his aura became<br />really murky.
4193756 4196858 He didn't even wanna<br />make love anymore.
4198427 4201229 He became just like a woman,<br />crying at every little thing.
4201697 4203598 There was no polarity.
4204400 4205833 But, I should have known.
4205835 4207268 He's a Pisces.
4238434 4239534 - Richard.
4242771 4244872 - I thought I told you<br />never to interrupt me
4244874 4246341 when I'm working.
4246343 4247642 What do you want?
4249245 4250712 - I just wanted to let you<br />know that I'm going to bed
4250714 4252614 and I'm taking a pill.
4271300 4273001 Are you coming to bed?
4273402 4274402 - No.
4280309 4282510 I have some more work to do.
4285514 4288583 - All right, see<br />you tomorrow, then.
4382978 4385613 - Sergeant Griff meadows<br />of the police department.
4385615 4387648 I'd like to ask you<br />a few questions.
4387650 4388650 - Okay.
4398660 4401662 - Does this look<br />familiar to you?
4404466 4406567 - It's a witch bottle.
4407469 4409570 - Do you have any idea<br />who could have made it?
4409572 4411072 - No, no I don't.
4414643 4417111 - Ever seen any of<br />these in here before?
4417113 4419414 - Yeah, we have<br />some witch bottles.
4419416 4420782 I'll show you one.
4427890 4428890 Here's one.
4432728 4434529 - How common are these bottles?
4434531 4435930 - I've never seen 'em<br />in here before until
4435932 4438933 a girl started<br />supplying 'em to us.
4440102 4441736 - Who is this girl?
4443038 4446040 - Her name is<br />Elaine, Elaine parks.
4473101 4474168 - Who is it?
4475771 4479006 - Sergeant meadows,<br />police department.
4484112 4486547 Sorry to bother you, ma'am,<br />but I'm investigating a case
4486549 4489617 and I just wanted to<br />ask you a few questions.
4489619 4490551 - About what?
4490553 4493754 - Well, it's a<br />potential homicide case.
4493756 4495556 Just a routine check.
4496692 4499026 I thought you might<br />be able to help us.
4499528 4500628 - Of course.
4502264 4504599 Please come in, sergeant.
4511573 4514509 So you say there was a homicide.
4514843 4515843 How horrible.
4516912 4518212 Who was killed?
4519014 4520648 - A man named Wayne Peters.
4521250 4522850 Did you know Wayne Peters?
4522852 4523852 - No.
4526555 4528589 - Here's a picture of him.
4528591 4530124 Ever seen him before?
4530126 4531126 - No.
4532094 4533761 I guess I can't<br />help you, sergeant.
4533763 4534763 Good bye.
4535531 4536531 - Ms. parks, wait.
4542905 4546741 Have you ever seen<br />anything like this before?
4547609 4548910 - It's a magic bottle.
4549578 4550545 I made it myself.
4550547 4554248 - Have you ever seen<br />one containing urine?
4554250 4555550 - Urine?
4556652 4557652 No.
4568297 4572333 - We found this bottle containing<br />urine and a used tampon
4573702 4576103 on the grave of Wayne Peters.
4579608 4582109 - Will you excuse me<br />for a moment, sergeant?
4587316 4590017 - Ms. parks, are you a witch?
4590352 4591352 - Yes, I am.
4592154 4593988 Is there a law against that?
4593990 4597825 - I guess not, not unless<br />you do something wrong.
4597827 4600127 - Do you think that being<br />a witch makes me evil,
4600129 4602129 capable of murder even?
4603198 4605600 - No, I wasn't<br />trying to imply...
4606702 4608869 - Sergeant meadows, do<br />you know what it's like
4608871 4610338 to really suffer?
4611808 4613274 You have to fight and fight
4613276 4616344 until you're too<br />exhausted to go on.
4617613 4619680 Witchcraft is my<br />religion, sergeant.
4620916 4624151 And this religion, which is<br />older than your Christianity,
4624653 4625653 saved my life.
4640035 4643771 - Ms. parks, I'm sorry<br />if I've offended you.
4646074 4647375 I didn't realize.
4651046 4654115 - That's all right,<br />sergeant Meadow.
4659655 4661722 - You can call me Griff.
4662791 4663791 - Griff?
4666896 4669296 I know I've seen you before.
4670932 4673000 I just don't know where.
4674069 4676370 - I have that same feeling.
4676972 4677972 - I know.
4682210 4684412 You're the man in the cards.
4685881 4687214 You're my fate.
4688450 4691352 - What do you mean,<br />I'm your fate?
4692154 4694255 - I did a Celtic cross reading.
4695390 4697858 For my future card I<br />got knight of wands.
4699928 4704165 Always felt that if that card<br />showed up in a future reading,
4705267 4707702 soon meet the man that<br />I'm going to marry.
4708970 4711472 But, the man that I marry<br />has to love animals.
4712274 4713841 Do you like animals, Griff?
4714443 4716477 - Why yes, I love animals.
4717345 4719346 In fact, a friend of<br />mine has a couple horses
4719348 4720848 I'm very fond of.
4721450 4723718 You know, tomorrow is my day off
4724820 4727321 and it's supposed to<br />be quite nice out.
4727323 4731392 Maybe I'll get away from<br />the city and do some riding.
4731394 4733794 Do you like to ride, Elaine?
4762224 4763224 Whoa.
4788283 4791552 - Oh patchouli, you're<br />such a sweetheart.
4802330 4803531 - How's my girl?
4804466 4805966 - Am I your girl?
4806434 4808169 - For today you are.
4809337 4810805 You're my girl and<br />there's nobody around
4810807 4812406 to tell me otherwise.
4814409 4815409 - Except me.
4816545 4818412 - And what's that<br />supposed to mean?
4818414 4821515 - Nothing.
4835030 4836564 - What's that sound?
4837299 4838499 - I don't know.
4839067 4840067 Let's go see.
4923285 4926587 - Now is the time of<br />the summer solstice.
4927923 4929957 The strength of the<br />oak king is waning.
4929959 4933160 And the Holly king stands<br />ready to challenge him
4933162 4935963 for the hand of<br />the green maiden.
4937632 4939600 - Let the battle begin.
4945307 4946540 - Your season is over old man.
4947376 4948575 - Oh never.
4955583 4957151 - I will have her.
4957153 4958185 - Never have her.
4959021 4960021 - Never.
4964327 4966660 - Holly king, I<br />name you the Victor.
4966662 4968662 The green maiden is yours.
4968664 4969664 - M'lady.
4971434 4972434 Come on.
4978673 4979673 - Elaine.
4980675 4982242 - You know these people?
4982244 4984044 - Well yes, in a way.
4984646 4986280 - All hail, fair lord and lady.
4986282 4988315 Welcome to our little gathering.
4988317 4989317 - All hail.
4990485 4992119 - We are the good people<br />of the renaissance
4992121 4996290 and medieval players and we<br />are celebrating the mid-summer.
4996292 4997658 Won't you join us?
4998460 5000427 - To be sure, fair consort.
5007736 5009536 - They are charming,<br />are they not?
5009538 5011438 - Yes, quite charming.
5012440 5014441 - I see two people in love.
5015243 5016477 This calls for a wedding.
5017212 5018212 - A wedding?
5018646 5020047 - Yes, a mock<br />wedding, if you will.
5020049 5022282 To honor the gods of love.
5144507 5145606 - Okay.
5227422 5228989 - Now, ye are wed.
5237398 5240500 - I'm so happy for you,<br />Elaine, he's adorable.
5272400 5274301 - I'm not in love.
5274303 5276003 It's not that I<br />don't have sentiment,
5276005 5277904 it's just that love is soft.
5277906 5279973 You need guts in this business.
5279975 5282509 I've seen guys get shot to<br />death because they fell in love
5282511 5284044 and got soft inside.
5284712 5286480 I want an heir some day
5286482 5287881 and then I would<br />need to have a wife,
5287883 5290284 but love is something else.
5290286 5292919 A man can get destroyed<br />by things like that.
5292921 5295489 It's like he's not<br />even a man anymore.
5295491 5297824 I never wanna get that way.
5298926 5301528 - When you really love him,
5301530 5305565 it's like fireworks and<br />nothing else matters.
5306401 5308402 You love all the little<br />quirks about him.
5308404 5310671 The way he slurps his cereal.
5311773 5313974 The way his mouth<br />is a little crooked.
5313976 5317944 Those details about him<br />become your whole life.
5319047 5321748 Something inside you<br />opens up like a flower
5322850 5325719 and you realize that you<br />have more love to give
5325721 5328689 than you ever<br />thought was possible.
5329490 5331858 'Cause the more you know him,
5332994 5334895 the more you love him.
5336097 5337731 - The more<br />you get to know a woman,
5337733 5340467 the less you can feel about her.
5340469 5342969 At first, she's this<br />incredible object of mystery
5342971 5346506 who fulfills all you're<br />wildest fantasies.
5346508 5349576 Then she starts to<br />reveal little flaws
5349578 5353513 and after a while, just<br />gets pretty hard to care.
5353515 5356950 Feminine ideal only<br />exists in a man's mind.
5358019 5360687 No woman could ever fulfill it.
5361823 5363924 And sometimes, when she<br />tries to love you more,
5363926 5367994 give you more, you feel<br />like you're suffocating,
5369430 5371064 drowning in estrogen.
5372567 5374568 The most awful feeling.
5382510 5384578 - Dinner tonight, Griff?
5385580 5387114 - Um, can't tonight, Connie.
5389016 5390617 Some other time.
5396491 5397691 - Hey Griff, I got<br />more information
5397693 5399493 on that Elaine parks girl.
5399495 5401528 - You leave it on my desk.
5402530 5402529 - Don't you wanna hear it?
5402531 5406466 - Steve, captain wants<br />us to lay off the case.
5406468 5406466 - Are you serious?
5406468 5411571 - He says we have a policy<br />of leaving the witches alone.
5411573 5413807 He says they've lived<br />in this town a long time
5413809 5415642 and he doesn't like<br />to mess with them.
5415644 5417544 - Even if they murder.
5418679 5420080 - He says he's satisfied<br />that Wayne's death
5420082 5421748 was a heart attack.
5422483 5423583 I think so too.
5427455 5429790 - Has everyone gone<br />crazy around here?
5429792 5433026 Let me at least tell<br />you what I found.
5437899 5440667 Now, Elaine used to run<br />an organic beauty store
5440669 5442702 in Berkeley with<br />her husband, Jerry.
5442704 5444438 Two years later<br />they were divorced
5444440 5446039 and Elaine moved<br />to San Francisco
5446041 5448175 to start dancing<br />at a burlesque club
5448177 5451745 where she got involved<br />with a witch coven.
5459053 5461488 The coven broke up<br />after police questioning
5461490 5463924 when some of it's members<br />died mysteriously.
5463926 5468161 Soon after, Elaine's ex-husband<br />died of a drug overdose
5469464 5472666 shortly before he was<br />planning to remarry.
5473468 5473467 The police questioned Elaine
5473469 5476903 but they couldn't find<br />enough to hold her.
5476905 5479706 - Well, if the San Francisco<br />police couldn't find anything,
5479708 5481675 what happened there is<br />none of our business.
5481677 5483243 - Are you serious?
5484545 5485812 - I'd say this woman is<br />a dangerous character
5485814 5487948 and you better watch her.
5489016 5490617 - You mean because<br />she's a witch?
5490619 5492252 That doesn't mean anything.
5492254 5496490 - No, her husband died of a<br />drug he'd never taken before.
5496492 5497958 And did you ever find<br />where Wayne Peters
5497960 5499759 got the devil's weed?
5500862 5502929 - I questioned Ms.<br />Curtis about that.
5502931 5505899 There was devil's weed<br />growing near his cabin.
5505901 5508635 Apparently, he experimented<br />often with drugs.
5508637 5510737 - Come on Griff, can't<br />you connect the dots?
5510739 5512138 We have a possible murder here
5512140 5514774 and Elaine is our only suspect.
5515877 5517544 - I told you, we're<br />laying off her.
5517546 5519946 - Because of orders or because<br />you're in love with her?
5519948 5521548 - Who says I'm in love with her?
5521550 5522716 Get the hell off my back.
5528089 5531925 - You're out of line,<br />Griff, way out of line.
5566795 5567795 - Richard.
5570565 5571565 Richard!
5572868 5573868 Richard!
5574335 5575335 Richard!
5622350 5624618 - Thank you for<br />meeting me, Elaine.
5624620 5627320 It's not good for me<br />to be alone too much.
5627322 5629089 I know you're busy.
5629091 5630156 - Of course.
5630825 5632192 I wanted to come.
5634328 5638098 - I can't help but blaming<br />myself for what happened.
5638100 5640400 - You can't blame yourself.
5641268 5643637 You were a good wife to Richard.
5644939 5646339 - I tried to be.
5648643 5651011 I tried so hard to please him,
5652013 5654280 but I should have tried harder.
5654282 5658718 He wanted a certain type of<br />woman, someone I could never be.
5661055 5662856 Maybe you were right.
5663924 5666726 Maybe you should give<br />a man his fantasy.
5668262 5672265 I thought that was so<br />awful when you said that.
5672933 5674734 Maybe I was being naive,
5675870 5678371 but I really thought<br />he loved me for me.
5679907 5681808 But now, now I wish...
5686280 5689716 - You have to stop<br />torturing yourself.
5690384 5691418 You have to let go.
5691420 5696189 Remember how he changed<br />after my Dallas trip?
5696191 5699693 I think that's when he<br />started having that affair.
5699695 5702762 Whoever she was she<br />drove him crazy.
5704065 5706733 I hated him so much for that.
5707401 5709736 I wanted to kill them both.
5711038 5714340 If I ever found out who she<br />was, I would rip her to pieces.
5715376 5718378 But now I see I should<br />have helped him.
5719947 5723283 I didn't know that he was<br />going to take his own life.
5724719 5725719 - Hey,
5726487 5727487 hey.
5729957 5731725 - Enough about me.
5733160 5734994 What's going on with you?
5734996 5738064 - Trish, I'm in love.
5740367 5741434 - Who is he?
5741436 5744437 - He's a detective<br />and he's everything
5745840 5747407 a woman could ever want.
5748442 5751911 He's strong and<br />handsome, smart and kind.
5754448 5757016 I just know that he's the one.
5757952 5760186 He even gave me this ring.
5760921 5762455 I call it my magic ring.
5763257 5763256 It's not an engagement ring
5763258 5768428 but I just know that he's<br />gonna pop the question soon.
5782746 5784245 - When we first came here
5784246 5788848 I showed you my<br />engagement ring, remember?
5791018 5792485 I can barely stand to<br />look at it anymore.
5792487 5794187 It's too painful.
5796457 5799459 I'm sure he's going<br />to ask you soon.
5799461 5802796 You're going to make<br />a beautiful bride.
5803464 5804531 The first day we met,
5806000 5808868 you were envious of<br />me because I had a man
5808870 5810870 and you were all alone.
5811505 5813540 Now it's the reverse.
5815242 5817310 Life is funny, isn't it?
5819914 5822515 - Trish, I'm sorry,<br />I've gotta go.
5822517 5825518 Would you like to<br />walk out with me?
5826587 5829389 - No, I'd like to stay<br />and finish my tea.
5829924 5830924 - All right.
5833427 5834828 Take care, love.
5875236 5877036 - Hi Elaine, it's me.
5877605 5879439 Yeah, you left your ring here.
5879441 5882909 You're probably driving but<br />I'll drop it by on my way home.
5882911 5884444 See you in a minute.
6207968 6209235 - You bitch.
6210838 6212738 You killed my husband.
6216643 6218578 Bitch, skank, whore.
6233227 6234827 You'll burn for this.
6245272 6246973 - Crash, crash, crash.
6248508 6249742 Die, die, die.
6301295 6303562 - Oh Habondia, bind these two
6304631 6306866 with a heady lovers' brew.
6307668 6310369 Even should they strive to flee
6310971 6312938 they'll cling for all eternity.
6324685 6325685 - Scotch.
6342602 6344503 - Bottle o' beer, Sam.
6351445 6353512 Who are those new girls?
6353980 6355715 They can't dance at all.
6356583 6357616 And they're weird.
6362589 6366625 - I don't know, but the<br />customers really like 'em.
6367728 6368928 - They're friends<br />of the witches.
6368930 6370930 I seen them come<br />in together before.
6370932 6372665 - Yeah, the witches.
6374034 6375668 They're everywhere.
6376570 6377803 - One gin and tonic, Sam.
6377805 6380039 - Gin and tonic coming up.
6380807 6382074 - Did you read about the teacher
6382076 6384110 buried in the back<br />yard of his cabin?
6384112 6386579 They said it was<br />dug by the witches.
6386581 6386579 - Oh yeah, I read about that.
6386581 6391083 They found all kinds of<br />witchcraft things on the grave.
6391085 6393552 - Yeah, I heard about that, too.
6393554 6394554 Creepy.
6412440 6413873 - Sit down, Elaine.
6421581 6424683 Elaine, the DNA came<br />back from the lab.
6426887 6429789 It connects you<br />with Wayne Peters.
6433593 6435027 Patricia Manning<br />came by the station.
6435029 6436862 Some things of yours.
6438665 6439965 Including this.
6442068 6445638 She said you drove her<br />husband to suicide.
6449009 6450976 - So, I was a bad girl.
6451778 6453913 Are you going to punish me?
6455582 6458818 - What sort of person<br />are you, Elaine?
6459953 6462688 What sort of sick mind<br />would do such things?
6463457 6464957 - Why are you so negative?
6464959 6466759 I didn't kill anyone.
6467561 6469695 Wayne died of heart failure
6470797 6473532 after a beautiful<br />night of lovemaking.
6474234 6477703 And Richard died because<br />he loved me too much.
6479105 6480573 These men weren't used to<br />the deep feelings of love
6480575 6482908 that they were<br />experiencing with me.
6482910 6485544 - Are you saying these<br />men died of love?
6485546 6486779 That's insane.
6487781 6490649 What about the<br />spells and the drugs?
6491852 6493552 Are you saying witchcraft<br />had nothing to do with it?
6493554 6497089 - Witchcraft is just a way<br />of concentrating energy.
6497091 6500125 It can only work with<br />what's already there.
6500127 6503696 I just use sex magic<br />to create love magic.
6504731 6507233 I didn't know how strong<br />the spells would be.
6507235 6510569 Sometimes it's almost scary<br />how strong the love gets.
6510571 6511670 - Love?
6512772 6515174 What do you know about love?
6516243 6519678 What you call love is a<br />borderline personality disorder
6520514 6521614 or worse.
6522249 6523983 - Don't diagnose me.
6525218 6528254 Maybe you're a narcissist<br />who can't love.
6529556 6531023 You think that I'm sick
6531025 6534560 because you've never<br />loved like I have.
6535262 6537663 Well, I would do<br />anything for love.
6539633 6543669 - That's right, you'll<br />never get enough love.
6544804 6547540 Even when a man loves<br />you so much it kills him,
6547542 6549241 it's not enough for you.
6549243 6551544 You're like a bottomless hole.
6551546 6555814 You doll yourself up and<br />do the Stepford wife thing
6557117 6559852 thinking every man is<br />going to fall at your feet.
6559854 6564089 But your creepy little sexy<br />act doesn't work with me.
6566660 6568127 I don't love you.
6574267 6576302 - How can you stand<br />there and boast
6576304 6578604 about being immune to love?
6579973 6583609 Why does the genuine love of<br />a woman scare you so much?
6584778 6587313 You think that your way<br />is a superior way to live?
6587315 6590215 I know a lot of women who<br />feel the way that I do.
6590217 6593953 Only men make us work<br />so hard for your love.
6595689 6599091 If you would just<br />love us for ourselves,
6601728 6602962 but you won't.
6604898 6607633 My ex-husband was just like you.
6608935 6612671 He used to punish me by<br />withholding his love from me.
6613807 6616675 All my life I've been<br />tossed in the garbage
6617711 6620813 except when men<br />wanted to use my body.
6622315 6625284 So, I decided to<br />find my own power.
6626386 6629622 And I found that power<br />through witchcraft.
6630690 6633359 That means that I take<br />what I need from men
6633361 6635861 and not the other way around.
6638665 6640399 - I'm sorry, Elaine.
6642936 6645004 It won't work this time.
6646139 6648907 I'm afraid I'm going<br />to have to arrest you.
6648909 6649909 - What for?
6651645 6654780 Marrying a lover<br />according to my religion?
6654782 6656749 Seducing a married man?
6657917 6659685 I know 400 years ago<br />you could be burned
6659687 6662855 for a thing like<br />that, but not today.
6666092 6667359 - No, not burned,
6670363 6674400 but you'll be booked for<br />burying Wayne Peters illegally
6675368 6677436 and we'll find out more.
6678805 6682708 - Oh, that's the witch<br />who killed the teacher.
6684010 6687179 - Thou shalt not<br />suffer a witch to live.
6691786 6692818 - Burn the witch.
