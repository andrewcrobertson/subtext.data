49488 50590 - [Voiceover] I'm starting a new<br />life.
50614 52658 (mooing)
54785 58914 Up here where it's quiet and<br />clean among the redwoods.
59540 61750 And almost no one knows me.
92614 94741 (gagging)
95158 97786 (whining music)
99204 100204 Poor Jerry.
103166 106712 I had a nervous breakdown<br />after he left me.
110424 112301 They say I'm cured now.
115220 118181 But I still have intrusive<br />thoughts.
125188 129234 My therapist told me that<br />I'm not unusual at all.
130319 133280 People are abused all over the<br />world
133322 134322 every day
135657 137075 much worse than me
139202 140579 and they do fine.
148378 151590 (police siren blaring)
178450 181078 (door slamming)
186333 188377 - Your tail light's out, Miss.
188418 191380 - Oh, thank you for letting me<br />know.
193548 195967 Are you gonna write me a ticket?
196009 200138 - I'll let you go this time,<br />but make sure you get it fixed.
201556 203266 - Thank you, Officer.
204810 206353 - You drive safely.
214319 217364 (engine starting up)
220534 222953 (eerie music)
230877 233839 - [Voiceover] When Jerry left me,<br />I devoured everything
233880 237092 I could about how to get your<br />man back.
237676 241555 According to the experts,<br />men are very fragile.
245058 249187 They can get crushed down if<br />you assert yourself in any way.
251273 253483 You have to be very tricky.
276715 279342 (door slamming)
292981 295609 (door slamming)
299362 300322 - Elaine?
300363 301490 Hi, I'm Trish.
301531 303325 - Hi, Trish, it's nice to meet<br />you.
303366 305243 - Oh, you're so pretty.
305702 307287 Oh, um, I didn't mean anything.
307329 308872 I'm married and everything.
308914 311333 - No, I didn't think anything.
311374 314586 - Well, let me help you with<br />your bags.
315170 316171 Is this all you've got?
316213 317172 - For now.
317214 319341 My art supplies are<br />being shipped over later.
319382 320550 - So you're an artist?
320592 321592 - Yes, I am.
322219 323762 - I'm an interior decorator.
323804 324846 - Oh, really?
325138 326138 - Yes.
333730 335482 That's how I met Barbara.
335524 337734 I decorated this apartment.
338276 340028 It was lucky I still had the<br />keys.
340070 343949 Barbara didn't exactly<br />know when she'd be back.
356503 358088 How do you know Barbara?
358129 360340 - We used to dance<br />together in San Francisco.
360382 361424 - Oh, really?
368682 370809 Well, I hope you like the<br />apartment.
370851 373770 It's a bit garish but<br />Barbara wanted it that way.
373812 376815 She had me take all of the<br />colors from the Thoth Tarot deck
376857 379150 and she and her students did<br />a bunch of occult paintings
379192 380402 for me to hang.
380819 383446 She's into all that Wicca stuff.
388952 390328 Well, this is it.
394624 396501 - Oh, Trish, I love it.
397002 398545 It's just beautiful.
398587 399587 - Really?
399880 401172 Oh, I'm so glad.
402007 403592 I thought I may have overdone<br />it.
403633 406177 - Oh no, it's exactly my taste.
407137 407929 - You must be exhausted.
407971 409556 I'm sure you want to lie down.
409598 411933 - Actually, I was thinking<br />about getting a bite to eat.
411975 414019 Do you know of a place around<br />here?
414060 415604 - There's the Victorian Tea<br />Room.
415645 418231 We could go together, if<br />you don't mind the company.
418273 419900 - Oh, how fantastic.
420609 421943 Where can I freshen up?
421985 423737 - The bedroom is through there.
423778 425739 - I'll only be a moment.
431119 433496 (harp music)
437375 440086 (light chatting)
458897 460607 - What a lovely room.
461191 462400 - Yes, isn't it?
462442 464110 I love Victoriana.
464152 467280 - Being here is like being<br />a princess in a fairy tale.
467322 470033 - Do you have fairy<br />princess fantasies, Elaine?
470075 471075 - Of course.
471534 473203 We may be grown women, but<br />underneath
473244 477374 we're just little girls<br />dreaming about being carried off
477415 479793 by a prince on a white horse.
480460 482087 - Yes, I suppose so.
482128 484255 It's ridiculous, isn't it?
490470 493974 - I don't think I've found<br />my Prince Charming yet,
494015 496267 but I think I found the formula.
496309 497745 You know, I've been<br />studying parapsychology
497769 501898 and I understand men so<br />much better than I used to.
504317 508446 If only I would have known<br />before what I know now.
510782 513576 Then Jerry would have never left<br />me.
513618 514744 - Who's Jerry?
515245 516538 - My ex-husband.
518164 521668 The day he left me was<br />the day that I died.
524129 526840 But then I was reborn as a<br />witch.
529259 531720 Barbara and Gahan brought me<br />back to life.
531761 535890 They taught me everything I<br />know about magic and about men.
537225 538977 Men are like children.
539436 541604 They're very easy to please
541938 545316 as long as we give them what<br />they want.

552699 556828 ♫ I dreamed of a fairy<br />lady in a strange land
560415 564544 ♫ She captured the hearts<br />of all the boys and men
569257 572052 ♫ She wore a gown

584731 585774 - Where were we?
585815 590028 Oh, men, you said we need<br />to give them what they want.
590070 591946 Well, what do men want?
592614 596451 - Just a pretty woman to<br />love and to take care of them
596493 599245 and to make them feel like a man
599287 600431 and to give them total freedom
600455 603083 in whatever they wanna do or be.
603583 605794 - But what about what we want?
605835 607420 How are we going to be equals<br />with men
607462 610965 if we keep catering to all of<br />their needs?
611007 615345 - I think that if you want<br />love, you have to give love.
615386 619516 Giving men sex is a way of<br />unlocking their love potential.
620266 624145 - You sound as if you'd been<br />brainwashed by the patriarchy.
624187 628316 Your whole self-worth is<br />wrapped up in pleasing a man.
628608 631486 I'll admit, I used sex to get<br />this,
632987 635073 but I'm not proud of it.
635115 638118 A whole world doesn't<br />revolve around a man's needs.
638159 640370 If I gave Richard sex<br />every time he wanted it,
640411 641621 I'd be a wreck.
641996 643206 - Poor Richard.
644165 648294 He loves you and he wants<br />you and you torture him.
650130 652715 You have to give a man his<br />fantasy.
652757 655552 - (laughing) His fantasy?
655593 657137 - Yes, his fantasy.
659639 662475 But what I'm really interested<br />in
662517 663517 is love.
665854 668731 You might say I'm addicted to<br />love.
669941 673027 I wonder if all women feel that<br />way?
673069 676573 - Well, it depends on<br />what you mean by love.
676614 678449 A husband isn't a prince,<br />Elaine,
678491 680827 and life isn't a fairy tale.
680869 682871 We have to face that fact.
682912 683912 - Why?
684539 685724 Maybe life could be a fairy tale
685748 687834 if you pleased your husband<br />more.
687876 690587 - (laughing) I don't<br />need to please Richard.
690628 692714 Richard loves me for myself.
692755 693755 - Of course.
694382 696926 Perhaps you did find your Prince<br />Charming.
696968 698261 - Perhaps I did.
704309 707520 (eerie harp strumming)
711524 712524 - Guess who.
713067 716112 - Richard, what are you doing<br />here?
716154 716946 (laughing)
716988 718615 This tea room is for ladies<br />only.
718656 720909 - Oh, I went to visit you at<br />work
720950 722160 and Julie said you were here.
722202 724746 I thought we could have lunch<br />together.
724787 727957 - Well, that's very sweet,<br />but I've already had my lunch.
727999 729876 Oh, uh, Richard, this is Elaine.
729918 732837 Elaine, this is my husband,<br />Richard.
733421 735673 - I've heard so much about you,<br />Richard.
735715 738301 - Nothing too horrible, I hope<br />(chuckles).
738343 739594 - On the contrary.
739636 742847 (eerie harp strumming)

821175 823386 (scraping)
877899 879359 - Goddess, please,
882111 884572 send me a beautiful, sweet man
886532 888576 to love me as I love him.
894332 895958 To love me, love me,
901130 902130 love me,
903966 904966 love me,
906636 907636 love me,
908805 909805 love me,
911015 912015 love me,
912683 913434 (light piano music)
913476 914476 love me.
934831 936290 Hi, are you Wendy?
936791 939210 - Yes, what can I do for you?
939252 940294 - I'm Elaine.
940628 942296 We spoke on the phone.
942338 945133 I make natural soaps<br />and candles and things.
945174 946551 - Elaine, right.
946592 948302 Thanks for coming by.
948761 950012 Mind if I have a look?
950054 951054 - Please do.
958563 959939 - These are nice.
963943 964943 Really nice.
966821 969699 I think these will do well in<br />the store.
969740 971284 - Then you'll take them?
971325 975037 - Let's start with these<br />and see how they do.
978541 981502 If these sell in the next<br />week or two, I'll order more.
981544 982544 Sound good?
982795 984172 - Yes, fantastic.
984589 985965 Thank you, Wendy.
986007 987216 - Sure, Elaine.
987508 988885 Bright blessings.
1000146 1002607 (cat calling)
1028716 1031385 - [Voiceover] People always<br />ask me why I'm a witch.
1031427 1035515 I tell them it's because I<br />want to have magical powers.
1035556 1037600 But it's not like it sounds.
1037642 1041771 All it is is using your<br />will to get what you want.

1077473 1078473 - Hi.
1079475 1080475 - Hi.
1082186 1085147 - (sighs) It's a beautiful day.
1085189 1086232 - Yes, it is.
1087650 1090027 I love to be out in<br />nature on days like this.
1090069 1091862 - Oh, you like nature?
1092280 1093280 - Very much.
1094282 1096909 You seem like a nature type too.
1097577 1100830 I'll bet you like to<br />spend time in the woods.
1100871 1102164 - That's right.
1102206 1103624 How'd you know?
1103666 1105167 - I can just tell.
1105209 1107878 Nature is where your heart is.
1107920 1111882 City and people can get<br />to be too much for you.
1111924 1116053 - Whuh, that is a lot to get<br />from someone in a few seconds.
1117888 1119849 - I'm talented that way.
1120850 1123811 - Well, you're right about the<br />city.
1124270 1126689 In fact, I have a house out in<br />the woods
1126731 1128691 about an hour from here.
1129150 1132278 I like to go there whenever<br />I can to, you know,
1132320 1133904 just think and read.
1135990 1137658 - Do you take your wife up<br />there?
1137700 1140411 - (chuckles) No.
1140786 1142079 I'm not married.
1143664 1144975 - Well, you might at<br />least take a girl up there
1144999 1146334 once in a while.
1146375 1149086 - (laughing) I do.
1149128 1150921 I do, once in a while.
1152131 1153924 - You wanna take a girl up there<br />now?
1153966 1156260 - (giggles)
1158220 1159597 What do you mean?
1161307 1163059 - Well, I'm new in town
1163100 1166646 and I haven't seen much<br />of the nature around here.
1166687 1168981 I'll make you a nice dinner.
1169565 1173694 - (laughing) Yes, okay, sure.
1174028 1176572 Uh, my car is right over there.
1177657 1178657 - Okay.
1179950 1180950 Let's go.
1183954 1186666 (birds chirping)
1204850 1207978 (car engine starting)
1210898 1213776 (tires screeching)
1226372 1228708 - (sighing)
1228749 1231961 You know what I'd like to do<br />right now?
1238175 1240136 I'd like to make love<br />right here in the car
1240177 1242054 just like we were kids.
1244557 1246350 - [Elaine] Wait, wait.
1250646 1251772 You want some?
1253733 1254775 - What is it?
1255526 1257069 - Something I made.
1261073 1263284 (clanging)
1264452 1265452 - Mm.
1266078 1269707 Oh, wo, ho, ho, ho,<br />that is, that is strong.
1271250 1272250 - Finish it.
1277590 1279717 (gulping)
1282970 1285431 - Oh (sighs).
1290561 1292605 - No, Wayne, Wayne, stop.
1294565 1295565 Not here.
1296025 1297318 Let's go inside.
1310164 1311624 This is beautiful.
1316837 1318631 I'll start the dinner.
1323552 1327681 (light piano music with<br />vocalising)
1340861 1343072 (sizzling)
1352122 1354750 (chime ringing)
1361215 1362215 - Wow.
1369223 1370933 This looks delicious.
1373936 1374936 - To nature.
1375604 1377815 (clinking)
1393998 1396584 - This is really nice, isn't it?
1397459 1399128 I like to come up here a lot
1399169 1401755 at the end of the semester to<br />unwind.
1401797 1403132 - Are you a teacher?
1403173 1405843 - Yeah, I teach at the<br />university.
1405885 1407845 - Oh, what do you teach?
1408762 1410514 - English and French literature
1410556 1413267 with a focus on the 18th<br />century.
1414018 1416437 - So, you must be quite a<br />libertine.
1416478 1417605 - A libertine?
1418772 1420399 Why would you say that?
1420441 1421775 - Oh, you know.
1421817 1425321 All of the dangerous<br />liaisons, Fanny Hill stuff.
1425362 1426697 Not to mention Casanova.
1426739 1430326 - (chuckles) Well, there<br />were a lot of books written
1430367 1431994 in the 18th century.
1432036 1433579 - Well, is it true?
1434079 1435706 Are you a libertine?
1436999 1437999 - Yes I am.
1439001 1440044 I love women.
1440836 1442546 Does that bother you?
1442588 1444048 - On the contrary.
1445049 1447426 - (Laughing)
1448969 1449969 Oh, hmm,
1452222 1454016 I feel strange, dizzy.
1459813 1462524 What was in that drink you gave<br />me?
1462566 1466445 - Organic berries, vodka,<br />hallucinogenic herbs.
1467988 1469865 - Hallucinogenic herbs?
1470491 1472201 (laughs)
1472242 1473242 Oh, baby.
1473702 1475329 You are really wild.
1475913 1479291 (ominous harp strumming)
1480876 1484880 - Would you mind if I made<br />myself more comfortable?
1484922 1485965 - Not at all.
1486674 1489134 (eerie music)
1505818 1509113 ♫ La ♫
1510864 1512157 - What the hell?

1516453 1519748 ♫ La ♫
1521208 1523502 - I always line my clothing.
1524169 1525963 - You have two selves.
1527423 1530592 Dark and quiet that you show the<br />world.
1531844 1533804 Who do you give that to?
1535139 1536139 The rainbow?
1537182 1539476 - I give the rainbow to you.
1541061 1542061 Right now.

1584313 1585313 - Huh!
1585939 1586939 Oh God.
1587858 1588858 Oh, Elaine.
1590903 1591903 Look at you.
1593447 1594990 - You can make love to me now.

1748977 1750604 - What is it, Wayne?
1751271 1752648 What is it, baby?
1754399 1756985 - Oh, Elaine, I feel so strange.
1759655 1762866 - It's all right, you're with<br />me, shhh.
1766745 1767745 - Elaine.
1770123 1774253 No woman has ever given<br />herself like that to me before.
1774878 1777089 - Life has been tough, huh?
1777464 1778840 - Yeah, in a way.
1783762 1787182 You're not like any other woman<br />I've met.
1787224 1788934 No games, no agendas.
1791311 1794273 You just seem to take life as it<br />is.
1796066 1798735 - Is there any other way to take<br />life?
1798777 1801488 - Well, the women I've been<br />with,
1802906 1804926 they all want you to make<br />a bunch of promises to 'em
1804950 1807411 as soon as you sleep with 'em.
1808287 1811456 But, how can you commit to someone<br />that you don't even know?
1811498 1812498 It's crazy.
1813250 1814459 - I know, baby.
1815752 1816752 I know.
1818463 1822592 - I never thought I wanted<br />to be tied down to anybody.
1823051 1827097 But it's just 'cause no<br />one was ever quite right.
1827681 1831476 All the women that I'm<br />attracted to physically
1831768 1834062 they're never bright enough.
1834438 1838692 And all the bright ones are<br />homely and don't arouse me.
1838734 1841528 - That seems like quite a<br />problem.
1842362 1845157 - It is (crying).
1845949 1848577 I feel my whole life as a loner,
1848994 1851538 thinkin' I didn't need anybody.
1853540 1855500 But now I'm not so sure.
1856460 1857460 Oh, Elaine,
1859212 1862883 I have never felt real<br />love like this before.
1863467 1867721 - You're just having a<br />lot of emotions right now.
1867763 1870307 - Oh (crying).
1870849 1872392 Elaine, I'm scared.
1875479 1879024 I'm not used to feeling<br />things so strongly.
1879566 1881610 I can't take it, I can't take<br />it.
1881651 1884154 Oh (grunting).
1885906 1890035 Elaine (heavy breathing), I'm<br />sick.
1890786 1891786 I'm sick.
1893413 1895207 - Hey, it's all right.
1897834 1898877 I've got you.
1899628 1900628 I love you.
1901004 1902172 (grunting)
1902214 1904841 And I'll always be here for you.
1907010 1908804 Try to get some sleep.
1910472 1913266 (heavy breathing)
1918271 1919981 - [Voiceover] Elaine.
1923652 1925445 Elaine, where are you?
1927155 1928949 Elaine, where are you?
1933703 1935247 - [Voiceover] What a pussy.
1935288 1936081 (crying)
1936123 1937123 What a baby.
1937457 1939459 I thought I'd found a real man,
1939501 1941420 but he's just like a little<br />girl.
1941461 1943171 - [Voiceover] Elaine!
1944047 1945483 - [Voiceover] No one was ever<br />there for me
1945507 1947676 when I was crying my heart out.
1947717 1949177 (crying)
1949219 1951263 No one ever comforted me.
1951930 1952930 No one.
1978665 1981293 (paper ripping)
1989718 1991928 (sizzling)

1999978 2002189 (scraping)
2013325 2016369 (door clacking open)
2027047 2028840 - Good morning, Wayne.
2029758 2030800 - Hi, Elaine.
2037390 2038934 - Here, drink this.
2043146 2045857 (cup clattering)
2049611 2052906 - I had such horrible dreams<br />last night.
2053240 2055951 - What did you dream about,<br />baby.
2056368 2058620 - I dreamt that I was calling<br />your name
2058662 2060539 and you didn't answer.
2060580 2064709 I kept calling and calling,<br />but I couldn't find you.
2067879 2070757 Oh, Elaine, you love me, don't<br />you?
2073134 2074386 - Of course, I love you.
2074427 2078557 - (crying) Oh God, oh God,<br />Elaine.
2084020 2085397 - Are you hungry?
2087440 2089484 - I don't know what I am.
2089859 2092320 - Well, try to get some sleep.
2093572 2094572 - Elaine.
2096449 2097826 Don't leave me.
2097867 2100078 - I'm not going anywhere, baby.
2100120 2101663 I'll be right here.
2128857 2130066 Wayne, wake up.
2130609 2131609 It's late.
2134112 2135112 Wayne.
2136197 2137866 Wayne, baby, wake up.
2139618 2140618 Wake up.
2141870 2142870 Wayne.
2145373 2146416 (gasping)
2146458 2148918 (eerie music)
2152464 2154507 (crying)
2168396 2172525 (birds chirping) (gentle<br />rhythmic music)
2218530 2221074 - [Voiceover] Tampons aren't<br />gross.
2221116 2224494 Women bleed and that's a<br />beautiful thing.
2225578 2229708 Do you know that most men have<br />never even seen a used tampon?
2236131 2238842 Part of me can be with Wayne<br />now.
2240593 2241593 Always.
2244431 2246641 I don't really mind death.
2246683 2248810 I've buried people before.
2250520 2251813 People I really cared about.
2251855 2254566 (dramatic music)
2257235 2260613 In the end we're all just<br />compost anyway.
2262240 2264117 Everything regenerates.
2267662 2270206 I'd like to come back as a cat.
2271207 2274586 I've been so depressed since my<br />cat died.
2274878 2279007 His name was Greymalkin,<br />but he was black and white.
2280300 2282093 He was my best friend.
2292061 2294189 (gonging)
2295356 2297984 (ominous music)
2301196 2303490 - I give the rainbow to you.
2306534 2307534 Right now.
2309954 2312665 (dramatic music)
2357710 2360839 (car engine starting)
2375728 2378690 (harpsichord music)
2403089 2406050 (door bell ringing)
2408052 2409178 Just a minute.
2416895 2417895 Oh hi Trish.
2418438 2419438 Come on in.
2419606 2420732 - Hey, Elaine.
2421149 2422317 You look gorgeous.
2422358 2424027 I love what you've done with<br />your hair.
2424068 2425068 - Thank you.
2425987 2427196 What's up, honey?
2427238 2428549 - Well, I haven't been able to<br />reach you,
2428573 2429532 so I thought I'd come over
2429574 2431659 to see if everything was all<br />right.
2431701 2432701 - I'm fine.
2433202 2434202 Really.
2435496 2437248 Can I offer you something?
2437290 2439834 I just made some tea and cake.
2439876 2441669 - Just tea, thank you.
2442295 2445256 (harpsichord music)
2454349 2455808 - Cream and sugar?
2455850 2457977 - No, I'm fine, thank you.
2460438 2463816 (slow harpsichord music)
2473826 2476621 So, what have you been so busy<br />with?
2476663 2477789 A man, I hope.
2478206 2479832 - Yes, it was a man.
2481250 2483211 But, it didn't work out.
2483670 2484754 - I'm Sorry.
2484796 2488341 - Yes, it's a shame<br />and I really liked him.
2491177 2492887 I thought that he was the one.
2492929 2494889 - Well, maybe next time.
2496432 2498893 - Are you sure you won't have<br />some cake?
2498935 2500561 - Oh, no, thank you.
2501354 2505316 I just came over to check up<br />on you and to say good bye.
2505358 2506358 - Good bye?
2507694 2509362 Why, where are you going?
2509404 2513366 - Oh, just to Dallas for<br />a furniture convention.
2513783 2515952 - Is Richard going with you?
2515994 2517662 - No, it's just a business trip.
2517704 2521749 Richard will have to fend<br />for himself for awhile.
2532844 2535304 (jazzy music)
2536139 2539517 (cheering and whistling)
2543980 2546357 (applauding)
2556409 2558828 - Sam, give me two whiskeys on<br />the rocks.
2558870 2560371 - Sure thing, Jane.
2562206 2563666 Did you see the papers today?
2563708 2564708 - No, why?
2565543 2567712 - They found a body in the Eel<br />River.
2567754 2568754 - A murder?
2569380 2570339 - Maybe.
2570381 2571340 (provocative music)
2571382 2574677 They found a symbol carved in<br />his chest.
2576262 2577262 Here.
2579265 2582226 - (gasps) It's a pentagram.
2582268 2584395 - It's them witches again.
2584812 2588024 - That's what I was thinking<br />too, Lyle.
2590068 2593196 - So yeah, Barbara, that's<br />everything.
2593488 2597200 After Jerry died, the cops<br />wouldn't stop harassing me.
2597241 2599368 They couldn't prove anything.
2599410 2602330 They actually thought that I<br />killed him.
2602371 2603915 Can you believe it?
2605166 2609087 Anyways, San Francisco got<br />to be a really bad trip
2609128 2610338 after you left.
2611923 2614675 That's when I remembered you<br />had that extra apartment.
2614717 2616677 - Well, it was perfect timing.
2616719 2619055 I'm just sorry I wasn't here to<br />greet you.
2619097 2620264 That's all right.
2620306 2622100 Trish has been lovely.
2622725 2625144 And I've been getting<br />a lot of artwork done.
2625186 2627480 But I had this experience last<br />weekend
2627522 2629482 that really shook me up.
2631567 2633319 - Why, what happened?
2633361 2636405 - Well, I met this great-looking<br />guy.
2636447 2638783 And I used love magic on him.
2638825 2641369 Then he got really weird on me.
2642370 2646165 All these emotions started<br />flowing out of him.
2648000 2649460 Then he got really
2650837 2651837 sick.
2652964 2655091 - Well, guys can't handle<br />their emotions too well.
2655133 2657969 That's why they don't<br />like heavy conversations.
2658010 2660179 It was probably just too much<br />for him.
2660221 2664100 All the love and the great<br />sex that you were giving him.
2664142 2666519 - I guess that's what it was.
2667145 2668604 But, I don't know.
2669605 2671899 - Honey, you have to be more<br />careful.
2671941 2673377 Maybe you shouldn't be<br />messing with love spells
2673401 2675778 in the first place, you know.
2677947 2679657 - Merry Meet, Elaine.
2680741 2682785 - Bright blessings Gahan.
2695089 2698217 (jazzy trumpet music)
2701721 2704557 - I heard you discussing love<br />spells.
2704599 2706475 You do have to be careful,<br />Elaine.
2706517 2710313 Love spells never work the<br />way you think they will.
2710354 2713858 But on a lighter note, it's<br />wonderful to see you, Elaine.
2713900 2716152 What's it been now, a year?
2716194 2720031 We must celebrate this<br />reunion of dear friends.
2720072 2722366 Thank you, Goddess, everywhere,
2724410 2726996 for the blessings that we share.
2727038 2729248 - [All] Blessed be, Hurrahya!
2731667 2733211 - Go home, witches.
2734837 2735837 Go home.
2737215 2738216 - Just ignore them.
2738257 2739926 They're always giving us<br />trouble.
2739967 2742678 - I didn't know this town<br />was hostile to witches.
2742720 2744972 - Well, it's certainly not San<br />Francisco.
2745014 2747433 But it's not bad for a small<br />town.
2747475 2749227 Not all of them embrace our<br />methods
2749268 2751103 of practicing witchcraft.
2751145 2754941 But, I don't see why we<br />ought to be so uptight now.
2754982 2758277 Back in the day, we all made<br />love freely
2758569 2762531 and put up Baphomet posters<br />and no one was dogmatic
2762573 2766077 about whether they were a witch<br />or a Satanist or a Thelemite
2766118 2768996 or a Druid or a Wiccan or<br />whatever.
2769956 2771165 And it was fun.
2771499 2772792 (applauding)
2772833 2775336 But our classes and circles<br />have been very popular.
2775378 2777838 (jazzy music)
2781384 2782260 - What have you been teaching?
2782301 2785596 - Let's see, I've got a<br />new class on sigil magic
2785638 2789141 and Barbara's got a new<br />class on organite alchemy.
2789183 2791477 Otherwise, we're still<br />teaching the staples,
2791519 2794313 energy grounding,<br />Earth-based spirituality,
2794355 2796148 pagan arts and crafts,
2796190 2800319 candle work, the spellcraft<br />master class, ancient mysticism,
2800695 2804240 herbs and spices, and<br />sex magic, of course.
2804907 2807702 - Oh, are you still teaching<br />that?
2808119 2811914 - Yes, in fact, we've invited<br />some girls here tonight
2811956 2815918 for a seminar about the<br />power of sexual dancing.
2816627 2820756 Dancing is such a powerful<br />thing for women and girls.
2821340 2823092 - Are you still dancing?
2823134 2825011 - Yeah, some of us dance<br />here on Amateur Night.
2825052 2826345 You should come.
2828848 2829849 - [Both] Hi, Barbara.
2829890 2830890 Hi, Gahan.
2831017 2832393 Sorry we're late.
2833060 2836522 - Hello lovely ladies, please<br />have a seat.
2838316 2841819 Elaine, this is Star and her<br />sister Moon.
2841861 2843863 They're our students for<br />tonight.
2843904 2846365 Girls, this is our dear friend<br />Elaine.
2846407 2847407 - Hi.
2847616 2848616 - [Both] Hi.
2849827 2851329 - I was just pointing out that<br />dancing
2851370 2854248 is a powerful thing for women<br />and girls.
2854290 2855791 We asked you to meet us here<br />tonight
2855833 2858294 so you could learn about that.
2860421 2863466 Do you see how powerful that<br />girl is?
2864592 2867678 These men would do anything for<br />her.
2867720 2871682 Wouldn't you like to have<br />that power yourselves?
2872475 2873934 Then let us begin.
2874518 2878647 All witches need to figure<br />out where their power lies.
2878689 2881692 And we feel that a woman's<br />greatest power
2881734 2883527 lies in her sexuality.
2884362 2888491 We don't view this power as<br />Satanic or anti-feminist,
2889075 2893162 but as a celebration of<br />woman as a natural creature.
2893621 2897666 An earthly body, a spiritual<br />essence, and a womb.
2900252 2902713 - The whole history of<br />witchcraft is interwoven
2902755 2905549 with the fear of female<br />sexuality.
2906008 2908761 They burned us at the<br />stake because they feared
2908803 2912056 the erotic feelings we elicited<br />in them.
2912098 2915393 Later, they used marriage<br />to hold us in bondage
2915434 2919563 and made us into servants,<br />whores, and fantasy dolls
2920022 2922566 never asking us what we wanted.
2923109 2926070 - They teach us that a<br />normative human being
2926112 2928906 is a hyper-rationalist, stoic<br />male
2929198 2932868 and that women's emotions<br />and intuitions are illnesses
2932910 2934703 that need to be cured.
2935746 2939333 And we believe that men<br />and women are different
2939375 2943421 and that true equality<br />lies in that difference.
2943462 2946424 - We strive for male/female<br />polarity and to regain
2946465 2948217 our primal power as goddesses.
2948259 2949844 (applauding)
2949885 2952096 We need to teach men how to love<br />us
2952138 2954890 using ways they can understand.
2954932 2957017 So goddesses, use perfume,
2958060 2960271 wear high heels and makeup,
2961272 2964567 learn to dress your<br />hair in attractive ways,
2964608 2968654 display flesh artfully,<br />and know what to conceal.
2969655 2971615 Be a mother and a lover.
2972783 2976912 Stand your ground, but always<br />let the man feel like a man.
2979874 2983002 - Use sex magic to destroy his<br />fear of you
2983043 2986589 and to open his heart to<br />the floodgates of love.
2986630 2990301 Only then will he begin to<br />see you as a human being
2990342 2992845 with all of your inner beauty.
2992887 2995264 Then, when his heart is open to<br />love,
2995306 2998267 you may do with him what you<br />will.
2998309 3000853 (lively music)
3013324 3016035 (tinkling music)
3019205 3021916 - [Voiceover] I love you,<br />Elaine.
3022249 3024293 You know that, don't you?
3026670 3028380 I love you very much.
3031675 3034303 But you need to be more careful.
3036889 3040017 Dinner was late three times this<br />week.
3040559 3043270 And that house is a total<br />pigsty.
3044313 3047525 Do you know that I found an old<br />hot dog
3048025 3049818 under the bed this morning?
3049860 3052071 (laughing)
3052446 3055407 And why don't you ever brush<br />your hair?
3055449 3059578 You need to take better care<br />of yourself and of the house.
3060746 3063707 I'm embarrassed to have people<br />over.
3064208 3066377 I've been really patient up<br />until now,
3066418 3069213 but you need to step up your<br />game.
3071715 3074635 - [Voiceover] I have a<br />crazy bitch for a daughter.
3074677 3077388 (laughing) What?
3078472 3080057 You're not crazy?
3080099 3083102 Well, if you're not<br />crazy then you're stupid.
3083143 3083936 Which is it?
3083978 3086480 Are you crazy or are you stupid?
3086522 3088732 And you could lose a few pounds.
3088774 3091235 You're looking a little fatty.
3092611 3094196 (heavy breathing)
3094238 3098367 - [Voiceover] Oh my God, Elaine,<br />you've lost so much weight.
3098659 3101036 You have such a hot body now.
3102162 3105332 Do you like it when I touch you<br />like this?
3105374 3106417 Or like this?
3107001 3109128 (moaning)
3109628 3111422 I wanna make you come.
3112172 3115718 (moaning and heavy breathing)
3115759 3117928 - [Voiceover] Don't be<br />frightened, Elaine.
3117970 3119847 I would never hurt you.
3120306 3122433 I'm not the big, bad wolf.
3123559 3127104 You need to have perfect<br />love and perfect trust.
3127146 3130274 (ominous organ music)
3165517 3168312 - Hast thou the courage to make<br />the essay?
3168354 3172483 - I have two words, perfect<br />love and perfect trust.
3177821 3180366 (bell chiming)
3185037 3188248 (dramatic organ music)
3191251 3194380 - Assist me to erect the ancient<br />altar
3194755 3197716 at which in days past all<br />worshiped.
3199718 3203180 For in the old times, a woman<br />was the altar.
3204390 3207643 And the sacred place was<br />the point within the center
3207685 3210979 of the circle, the origin of all<br />things.
3214441 3216902 Therefore, should we adore it.
3220989 3221865 (clanking)
3221907 3224034 (gasping)
3227788 3230582 (heavy breathing)
3247516 3249643 - Good morning, Sergeant Griff.
3249685 3251770 Congratulations on your<br />promotion.
3251812 3253188 - Thanks, Connie.
3253856 3255482 Is there any coffee.
3255774 3257151 - Yeah, I just made some.
3257192 3260070 I made it just the way you like<br />it.
3260821 3263323 - Is there anything you don't do<br />well?
3263365 3267077 - Why don't you try me<br />sometime and find out?
3272374 3274126 - How's the coffee, Steve?
3274168 3275544 - Uh, too strong.
3278380 3280424 - Well, I like it strong.
3281008 3284261 Man's gotta stay awake<br />on the job after all.
3284303 3287681 - Why, have you been keeping<br />late nights?
3287723 3288723 - Maybe so.
3292770 3294563 - But, now that you've been<br />promoted,
3294605 3297608 maybe you ought to start<br />thinking about settling down.
3297649 3299109 - Me, you kidding?
3305574 3309286 - Sergeant Meadows, a<br />lady's here to see you.
3309578 3311038 - I'm Shelly Curtis.
3311079 3315209 I phoned about Wayne Peters,<br />the teacher who disappeared.
3315584 3316960 - Yes, of course.
3317461 3319505 Have a seat, Miss Curtis.
3321590 3325177 You say you think Mr. Peters<br />might have been kidnapped?
3325219 3328555 - Yes, no one's seen him for two<br />weeks.
3328597 3332351 I went by his house and<br />the mail's piled up.
3332392 3335354 We had lunch the day he<br />disappeared.
3335938 3339817 I saw him drive away with a<br />strange woman near the plaza.
3339858 3342820 - Do you have any idea where<br />he might have gone with her?
3342861 3344238 - Wayne used to spend weekends
3344279 3347074 up in a cabin he had in the<br />woods.
3348867 3350702 He used to take dates there.
3350744 3353205 (eerie music)
3377354 3380315 (eerie piano music)
3382359 3385571 - (Gasping) Oh, Jesus.
3399084 3402379 ♫ La ♫
3406842 3408302 - Hey Griff, look.
3409928 3410721 - Good lord.
3410762 3414057 ♫ La ♫
3420272 3421481 - What the hell is this?
3421523 3423442 ♫ La ♫
3423483 3424693 - I don't know.
3427112 3429156 (crying)
3432701 3434119 We're going to have to dig,<br />Steve.
3434161 3435161 - I know.
3437998 3441293 ♫ La ♫
3441793 3443313 I think you should go<br />back to the house, Shelly.
3443337 3445380 (crying)
3452429 3455933 ♫ La ♫
3455974 3458143 (eerie music)
3458185 3460479 (shoveling)
3470072 3471072 - Mmm, mmm,
3475994 3478789 this cake is absolutely<br />fantastic.
3479247 3480832 And what a great dinner.
3480874 3481874 - Thank you.
3482542 3483835 I enjoy cooking.
3485295 3487965 Hope you don't mind my calling<br />you.
3488006 3490968 Sometimes it's so hard to be<br />alone.
3491009 3492052 - Not at all.
3493595 3497724 I get a little lonely, too,<br />when Trish is out of town.
3504898 3506900 - How long have you<br />and Trish been married?
3506942 3509111 - 10 years this September.
3509152 3510152 - 10 years!
3512030 3513657 It's really amazing.
3515701 3519830 No one has ever loved me the<br />way you love Trish, no one.
3527087 3529214 - What about your husband?
3529631 3531842 - My husband never loved me.
3531883 3534928 He couldn't wait to get away<br />from me.
3535762 3536762 - I'm sorry.
3546356 3550485 Sometimes I think Trish would<br />like to get away from me, too.
3551361 3552361 - Poor baby.
3553822 3555115 Poor, poor baby.
3585687 3588231 So, tell me, what turns you on?
3590067 3593945 - (laughing) What turns me on?
3594488 3597449 Wow, no one's ever asked me that<br />before.
3597491 3598533 Let me think.
3600911 3603622 You know what really turns me<br />on?
3603914 3604914 Flying.
3605624 3606624 - Flying?
3606917 3608794 - Yeah, flying a plane.
3609419 3611755 You don't know what kinda high<br />it is.
3611797 3614716 You're soarin' up there above<br />everything.
3614758 3616426 You're in control.
3616468 3618095 - Oh, how fantastic.
3619471 3620680 - It really is.
3621598 3625894 It's the only time I feel<br />really clear about things.
3625936 3630065 Sometimes I look at my life<br />and I wonder how I got here.
3634736 3636321 I feel like my life is slipping<br />away
3636363 3638782 and there's so many things I<br />haven't done.
3638824 3639824 - Like what?
3640075 3641660 - I've never had any sordid love<br />affairs
3641701 3643995 or gotten into any mischief.
3645622 3647666 I used to watch those<br />old Steve McQueen movies,
3647707 3650919 you know, the ones where<br />they'd rob a bank or something,
3650961 3652561 and I'd fantasize that I was one<br />of those
3652587 3656716 crazy kinda gangsters with a<br />sexy, messed up girl on my arm.
3658135 3661930 Or those Westerns, when<br />they'd shoot up a town
3662222 3665475 and then go visit the local<br />prostitutes.
3665517 3667519 It's sounds stupid, I know.
3667561 3668895 - No, it doesn't.
3671106 3672399 It's very sweet.
3674442 3675442 - Really?
3677445 3679322 Trish doesn't think so.
3679865 3683201 She just rolls her eyes<br />when I talk like this.
3683243 3686872 - That's because she<br />doesn't understand you.
3687205 3689416 I understand you perfectly.
3691501 3692501 - You do?
3692669 3693669 - Of course.
3695505 3698466 You wanna have a sordid love<br />affair.
3699384 3702095 You wanna get into some<br />mischief.

3752520 3754731 (laughing)
3755273 3757651 (provocative music)
3757692 3758692 - Uh.
3776503 3777503 - Ho!
3786096 3788473 (horn music)
3789099 3791309 (laughing)
3799526 3801820 (screaming)
3802153 3804364 (laughing)
3804990 3805990 Who are you?
3806908 3808952 What are you doing to me?
3809494 3811204 - I'm the love witch.
3812622 3816167 I'm your ultimate fantasy<br />(laughing).
3816209 3817627 - That's right.
3817669 3819796 (grunting)
3819838 3820630 That's right.
3820672 3822882 (giggling)
3827887 3830015 - Steve, I'm going out<br />to see that witch doctor.
3830056 3831056 - Who?
3831224 3832517 - Professor King.
3832559 3835270 He specializes in black<br />magic and witchcraft.
3835312 3836104 He might be able to help me
3836146 3837939 identify some of the items we<br />found.
3837981 3839190 - It's great.
3839232 3840900 Did you get the lab report?
3840942 3844571 - Yeah, yeah, it looks like<br />heart failure.
3844612 3847824 But the toxicology report<br />showed traces of Jimson weed
3847866 3851995 also known as Devil's weed, a<br />highly toxic hallucinogenic.
3852620 3854247 - It's unbelievable.
3854622 3856207 You want me to come with you?
3856249 3858918 - No, this will only take a few<br />minutes.
3858960 3861546 Can you order me a turkey<br />and avocado on whole wheat?
3861588 3862881 - Mustard, mayo?
3863465 3865175 - Yeah and cole slaw.
3865800 3866593 Thanks.
3866634 3867634 - Done.
3868845 3871306 (eerie music)
3876394 3879731 - Ah, Sergeant Meadows, sorry<br />to have kept you waiting.
3879773 3882233 - Glad to meet you, Professor.
3885195 3887947 Professor, this is the<br />bottle we found in a grave
3887989 3892118 of Wayne Peters, the one<br />you read about in the paper.
3892160 3893703 - Interesting, yes.
3894621 3897082 (sniffing) Just as I thought.
3897123 3900001 The contents indicate<br />that it's a witch bottle.
3900043 3901211 - A witch bottle?
3901252 3902396 - Yes, witches used to make them
3902420 3905048 for protection against curses.
3905090 3908551 They'd take something personal<br />like bodily fluids or hair
3908593 3910428 along with herbs and something<br />sharp
3910470 3914641 like pins or broken glass<br />to scare away evil spirits.
3914682 3916702 Witch bottles have often been<br />found buried in the hearths
3916726 3918353 of very old houses.
3918395 3921064 - Would it be safe to assume<br />that the person who made this
3921106 3922106 was a witch?
3922607 3924109 - It's very likely.
3924150 3926403 Witchcraft, long dormant<br />in civilized places,
3926444 3928822 has taken root again in cities.
3928863 3930824 There have several rituals per<br />year.
3930865 3935078 One of them, Samhain,<br />corresponds of our Halloween.
3935120 3938915 Other rituals celebrate<br />Summer Solstice, Litha,
3938957 3942752 or the Winter Solstice,<br />which they call Imbolg.
3946089 3948800 Here the members of a coven<br />kiss the devil's behind
3948842 3951636 in a mockery of Christian<br />rituals.
3953513 3956808 Here, a satanic cult sacrifices<br />a child.
3958184 3959686 - Does this stuff really go on<br />today?
3959727 3960854 - Yes, indeed.
3961604 3964774 Those who practice human<br />sacrifice are the black witches
3964816 3967777 who perform blood rituals<br />to gain demonic powers
3967819 3971156 and to bind their members<br />together in secrecy.
3971197 3973491 Law has been trying to root<br />out these cults for decades
3973533 3975618 but they've been unsuccessful.
3975660 3977787 Then there are the<br />white witches or Wiccans
3977829 3980248 who commune in nature<br />in the healing spirit
3980290 3983418 and who have a strict law<br />that forbids harming others.
3983460 3985628 Every city and rural<br />village today has pockets
3985670 3987130 of both black and white witches
3987172 3989716 who practice the ancient rites.
4020705 4024834 - I invoke and call upon<br />thee, Mighty Mother of us all.
4026544 4030673 I invoke thee to descend upon<br />the body of this thy servant
4032217 4033343 and priestess.
4035470 4037889 - Of the Mother Darksome and<br />Divine
4037931 4040475 here I charge you in this sign.
4043311 4046648 - Listen to the words of the<br />Great Mother.
4046689 4048858 (owl hooting)
4048900 4052320 She, who of old, who<br />was also called Artemis,
4052362 4055073 Aphrodite, Cerridwen, Diana,<br />Isis,
4058034 4059994 and by many other names.
4060912 4063623 (owl hooting) (crickets<br />chirping)
4063665 4066042 - Whenever ye have need of<br />anything,
4066084 4070213 then ye shall assemble in some<br />secret place and adore me,
4071214 4073508 who am Queen of all witches.
4074384 4078221 There shall ye assemble,<br />ye who are fain to learn
4078263 4079263 all sorcery.
4080640 4084894 Behold all acts of love and<br />pleasure are my rituals.
4084936 4088815 Behold I have been with<br />thee from the beginning
4088856 4092986 and I am that which is<br />attained at the end of desire.
4096698 4100743 (chanting in a foreign language)<br />Bagabi lacha bachabe.
4102245 4106207 Lamac cahi achababe.
4106499 4110461 Hurrahya! Hurrahya!
4115717 4116717 - Arise.

4158509 4160309 - You're looking a little<br />tense tonight, love.
4160345 4161804 What's the matter?
4163056 4167185 - Oh nothing, just my usual<br />roller coaster love life.
4167518 4169604 - Well, have a drink and relax.
4169646 4173107 Nothing's that dire, at least<br />not for you.
4173399 4177487 It's an entirely different<br />story for your victims.
4179113 4180365 - What victims?
4180406 4184118 - There's no need to play<br />Miss Innocent with me, dearie.
4184160 4186162 - Please, don't touch me.
4192168 4193503 - Bright blessings, Barbara.
4193544 4194921 - Merry meet, Elaine.
4194962 4196130 How's it going?
4196631 4198132 - I'm back in the dating pool<br />again.
4198174 4199467 - What happened?
4200301 4202488 I thought you were crazy about<br />that new guy you were seeing,
4202512 4203805 the married man.
4204180 4205890 - No, I broke it off.
4206307 4209602 He just became really obsessive,<br />morose,
4210645 4213356 and his aura became really<br />murky.
4214315 4217527 He didn't even wanna make love<br />anymore.
4217568 4221698 He became just like a woman,<br />crying at every little thing.
4222281 4224075 There was no polarity.
4224742 4226619 But, I should have known.
4226661 4227787 He's a Pisces.
4259235 4260235 - Richard?
4263531 4264633 - I thought I told you<br />never to interrupt me
4264657 4266033 when I'm working.
4266909 4268286 What do you want?
4269495 4271515 - I just wanted to let you<br />know that I'm going to bed
4271539 4273291 and I'm taking a pill.
4291893 4293686 Are you coming to bed?
4293978 4294978 - No.
4300902 4303196 I have some more work to do.
4306282 4309243 - All right, see you tomorrow,<br />then.

4403754 4406340 - Sergeant Griff Meadows<br />of the Police Department.
4406382 4408384 I'd like to ask you a few<br />questions.
4408426 4409426 - Okay.
4419395 4422106 - Does this look familiar to<br />you?
4425234 4426986 - It's a witch bottle.
4428195 4430281 - Do you have any idea<br />who could have made it?
4430323 4431699 - No, no I don't.
4435411 4437830 - Ever seen any of these in here<br />before?
4437872 4439957 - Yeah, we have some witch<br />bottles.
4439999 4441459 I'll show you one.
4448674 4449674 Here's one.
4453471 4455264 - How common are these bottles?
4455306 4456658 - I've never seen 'em in here<br />before until
4456682 4459560 a girl started supplying 'em to<br />us.
4460853 4462396 - Who is this girl?
4463773 4466651 - Her name is Elaine, Elaine<br />Parks.
4467818 4470863 (bubbling, clinking)
4477495 4480706 (light rhythmic music)
4484752 4486963 (knocking)
4493844 4494844 - Who is it?
4496514 4499642 - Sergeant Meadows, Police<br />Department.
4504855 4507042 Sorry to bother you, ma'am,<br />but I'm investigating a case
4507066 4510111 and I just wanted to<br />ask you a few questions.
4510152 4511195 - About what?
4511946 4514407 - Well, it's a potential<br />homicide case.
4514448 4516158 Just a routine check.
4516450 4519662 I thought you might be able to<br />help us.
4520121 4521121 - Of course.
4523207 4525251 Please come in, Sergeant.
4532299 4534927 So you say there was a homicide.
4535344 4536387 How horrible.
4537638 4539015 Who was killed?
4539056 4541267 - A man named Wayne Peters.
4541934 4543561 Did you know Wayne Peters?
4543602 4544602 - No.
4547273 4549275 - Here's a picture of him.
4549316 4550818 Ever seen him before?
4550860 4551860 - No.
4552528 4554447 I guess I can't help you,<br />Sergeant.
4554488 4555322 Good bye.
4555364 4556824 - Ms. Parks, wait.
4563664 4567376 Have you ever seen<br />anything like this before?
4567752 4569587 - It's a Magic Bottle.
4569628 4571005 I made it myself.
4572131 4575134 - Have you ever seen one<br />containing urine?
4575176 4576176 - Urine?
4577386 4578386 No.
4589023 4593152 - We found this bottle containing<br />urine and a used tampon
4594403 4596781 on the grave of Wayne Peters.
4596822 4599075 (fizzing)
4599116 4602745 - Will you excuse me<br />for a moment, Sergeant?
4608250 4610628 - Ms. Parks, are you a witch?
4611003 4612003 - Yes, I am.
4612671 4614673 Is there a law against that?
4614715 4618511 - I guess not, not unless<br />you do something wrong.
4618552 4620805 - Do you think that being<br />a witch makes me evil,
4620846 4622723 capable of murder even?
4623516 4626310 - No, I wasn't trying to<br />imply...
4626352 4629522 - Sergeant Meadows, do<br />you know what it's like
4629563 4630940 to really suffer?
4631440 4632483 (sad music)
4632525 4633943 You have to fight and fight
4633984 4637071 until you're too exhausted to go<br />on.
4637113 4640074 Witchcraft is my religion,<br />Sergeant.
4640616 4644870 And this religion, which is<br />older than your Christianity,
4644912 4646038 saved my life.
4648457 4650668 (bubbling)
4655005 4657258 (sad music)
4660761 4664390 - Ms. Parks, I'm sorry<br />if I've offended you.
4666767 4668144 I didn't realize.
4671730 4674692 - That's all right, Sergeant<br />Meadows.
4676318 4679029 (harp strumming)
4680156 4682116 - You can call me Griff.
4683450 4684450 - Griff?
4684869 4687580 (lightly romantic music)
4687621 4689915 I know I've seen you before.
4691667 4693627 I just don't know where.
4694753 4696964 - I have that same feeling.
4697673 4698673 - I know.
4702928 4705222 You're the man in the cards.
4706599 4707808 You're my fate.
4709143 4711937 - What do you mean, I'm your<br />fate?
4712271 4715024 - I did a Celtic Cross reading.
4715065 4718444 For my future card I got Knight<br />of Wands.
4720613 4724783 Always felt that if that card<br />showed up in a future reading,
4724825 4728329 I would soon meet the man<br />that I'm going to marry.
4728370 4732166 But, the man that I marry<br />has to love animals.
4732208 4734418 Do you like animals, Griff?
4734960 4737046 - Why yes, I love animals.
4737963 4740007 In fact, a friend of<br />mine has a couple horses
4740049 4741634 I'm very fond of.
4741675 4744303 You know, tomorrow is my day off
4744929 4747973 and it's supposed to be quite<br />nice out.
4748015 4752019 Maybe I'll get away from<br />the city and do some riding.
4752061 4754355 Do you like to ride, Elaine?
4757733 4761195 (gentle orchestral music)
4782925 4783925 Whoa.
4808951 4812329 - Oh Patchouli, you're such a<br />sweetheart.
4823007 4824300 - How's my girl?
4825175 4826510 - Am I your girl?
4827094 4828721 - For today you are.
4830014 4831449 You're my girl and there's<br />nobody around
4831473 4833183 to tell me otherwise.
4835102 4836102 - Except me.
4837438 4839023 - And what's that supposed to<br />mean?
4839064 4842276 - (chuckling) Nothing.
4842943 4845070 Kiss me.
4846989 4849450 (flute music)
4855748 4857333 - What's that sound?
4857875 4859084 - I don't know.
4859710 4860502 Let's go see.

4934451 4938497 (Medieval string and wind music)
4943961 4947464 - Now is the time of the Summer<br />Solstice.
4947506 4950592 The strength of the Oak King is<br />waning.
4950634 4953762 And the Holly King stands<br />ready to challenge him
4953804 4956515 for the hand of the Green<br />Maiden.
4958475 4960352 - Let the battle begin.
4965941 4967359 - Your season is over old man.
4967401 4968193 (clattering)
4968235 4969235 - Oh never.
4971655 4973866 (grunting)
4976410 4977744 - [Voiceover] I will have her.
4977786 4978847 - [Voiceover] Never have her.
4978871 4979663 (laughing)
4979705 4980497 - Never.
4980539 4982875 (yelling)
4982916 4984918 (applauding)
4984960 4987463 - Holly King, I name you the<br />victor.
4987504 4989506 The Green Maiden is yours.
4989548 4990548 - M'lady.
4990966 4992050 (laughing)
4992092 4993092 Come on.
4999516 5000516 - Elaine.
5001477 5002853 - You know these people?
5002895 5004646 - Well yes, in a way.
5004688 5006899 - All hail, fair Lord and Lady.
5006940 5008901 Welcome to our little gathering.
5008942 5009942 - All hail.
5011111 5012714 - We are the good people<br />of the Renaissance
5012738 5016867 and Medieval players and we<br />are celebrating the Midsummer.
5016909 5018368 Won't you join us?
5018744 5020954 - To be sure, fair consorts.
5028587 5030339 - They are charming, are they<br />not?
5030380 5032174 - Yes, quite charming.
5032758 5035135 - I see two people in love.
5035177 5037387 This calls for a wedding.
5037429 5038388 - A wedding?
5038430 5040641 - Yes, a mock wedding, if you<br />will.
5040682 5042809 To honor the gods of love.

5293185 5294853 - [Voiceover] I'm not in love.
5294895 5296730 It's not that I don't have<br />sentiment,
5296772 5298648 it's just that love is soft.
5298690 5300734 You need guts in this business.
5300776 5303045 I've seen guys get shot to<br />death because they fell in love
5303069 5304696 and got soft inside.
5305322 5306990 I want an heir some day
5307032 5308617 and then I would need to have a<br />wife,
5308658 5310827 but love is something else.
5310869 5313663 A man can get destroyed<br />by things like that.
5313705 5316249 It's like he's not even a man<br />anymore.
5316291 5318502 I never wanna get like that.
5319669 5322297 - [Voiceover] When you really<br />love him,
5322339 5326009 it's like fireworks and<br />nothing else matters.
5326802 5328929 You love all the little quirks<br />about him.
5328970 5331348 The way he slurps his cereal.
5332349 5334684 The way his mouth is a little<br />crooked.
5334726 5338814 Those details about him<br />become your whole life.
5338855 5342400 Something inside you<br />opens up like a flower
5343109 5346446 and you realize that you<br />have more love to give
5346488 5349366 than you ever thought was<br />possible.
5350116 5352494 'Cause the more you know him,
5353745 5355539 the more you love him.
5356915 5358518 - [Voiceover] The more<br />you get to know a woman,
5358542 5361127 the less you can feel about her.
5361169 5363713 At first, she's this<br />incredible object of mystery
5363755 5367050 who fulfills all you're wildest<br />fantasies.
5367092 5370095 Then she starts to reveal little<br />flaws
5370136 5374015 and after a while, just<br />gets pretty hard to care.
5374057 5377602 Feminine ideal only<br />exists in a man's mind.
5378770 5381481 No woman could ever fulfill it.
5381523 5384651 And sometimes, when she<br />tries to love you more,
5384693 5388655 give you more, you feel<br />like you're suffocating,
5389990 5391700 drowning in estrogen.
5393118 5394995 The most awful feeling.
5403295 5405463 - Dinner tonight, Griff?
5405505 5407799 - Um, can't tonight, Connie.
5409759 5411052 Some other time.
5417267 5418411 - Hey Griff, I got more<br />information
5418435 5420020 on that Elaine Parks girl.
5420061 5422314 - You leave it on my desk.
5422355 5423565 - Don't you wanna hear it?
5423607 5426985 - Steve, Captain wants<br />us to lay off the case.
5427027 5428403 - Are you serious?
5428445 5432073 - He says we have a policy<br />of leaving the witches alone.
5432115 5434492 He says they've lived<br />in this town a long time
5434534 5436328 and he doesn't like to mess with<br />them.
5436369 5438163 - Even if they murder?
5439456 5440850 - He says he's satisfied<br />that Wayne's death
5440874 5442417 was a heart attack.
5443043 5444210 I think so too.
5448006 5450508 - Has everyone gone crazy around<br />here?
5450550 5453678 Let me at least tell you what I<br />found.
5458642 5461394 Now, Elaine used to run<br />an organic beauty store
5461436 5463396 in Berkeley with her husband,<br />Jerry.
5463438 5465148 Two years later they were<br />divorced
5465190 5466733 and Elaine moved to San<br />Francisco
5466775 5468902 to start dancing at a burlesque<br />club
5468944 5472364 where she got involved with a<br />witch coven.
5479788 5481998 The coven broke up<br />after police questioning
5482040 5484668 when some of it's members<br />died mysteriously.
5484709 5488838 Soon after, Elaine's ex-husband<br />died of a drug overdose
5489631 5493218 shortly before he was planning<br />to remarry.
5493259 5494803 The police questioned Elaine
5494844 5497597 but they couldn't find enough to<br />hold her.
5497639 5500392 - Well, if the San Francisco<br />Police couldn't find anything,
5500433 5502352 what happened there is<br />none of our business.
5502394 5504062 - Are you serious?
5504104 5506523 - I'd say this woman is<br />a dangerous character
5506564 5508608 and you better watch her.
5509317 5511277 - You mean because she's a<br />witch?
5511319 5513154 That doesn't mean anything.
5513196 5517200 - No, her husband died of a<br />drug he'd never taken before.
5517242 5518636 And did you ever find where<br />Wayne Peters
5518660 5520370 got the Devil's weed?
5521287 5523665 - I questioned Ms. Curtis about<br />that.
5523707 5526626 There was Devil's weed<br />growing near his cabin.
5526668 5529337 Apparently, he experimented<br />often with drugs.
5529379 5531464 - Come on Griff, can't<br />you connect the dots?
5531506 5532841 We have a possible murder here
5532882 5535510 and Elaine is our only suspect.
5535552 5537887 - I told you, we're laying off<br />her.
5537929 5540640 - Because of orders or because<br />you're in love with her?
5540682 5542058 - Who says I'm in love with her?
5542100 5543435 Get the hell off my back.
5543476 5545687 (punching)
5548815 5552527 - You're out of line,<br />Griff, way out of line.
5555697 5558324 (ominous music)
5585268 5587479 (water running)
5587520 5588520 - Richard.
5591066 5592066 Richard!

5593610 5594610 Richard!

5621971 5623973 (crying)
5625892 5628853 (gentle harp music)
5643243 5645286 - Thank you for meeting me,<br />Elaine.
5645328 5648206 It's not good for me to be alone<br />too much.
5648248 5649791 I know you're busy.
5649833 5650833 - Of course.
5651417 5652794 I wanted to come.
5655046 5658758 - I can't help but blaming<br />myself for what happened.
5658800 5661010 - You can't blame yourself.
5661386 5664013 You were a good wife to Richard.
5665640 5666933 - I tried to be.
5669144 5671604 I tried so hard to please him,
5672730 5674941 but I should have tried harder.
5674983 5679112 He wanted a certain type of<br />woman, someone I could never be.
5681739 5683449 Maybe you were right.
5684033 5687328 Maybe you should give a man his<br />fantasy.
5688997 5692876 I thought that was so<br />awful when you said that.
5693376 5695336 Maybe I was being naive,
5695879 5699174 but I really thought he loved me<br />for me.
5700633 5702427 But now, now I wish...
5707182 5710310 - You have to stop torturing<br />yourself.
5710643 5712187 You have to let go.
5713354 5716858 Remember how he changed<br />after my Dallas trip?
5716900 5720361 I think that's when he<br />started having that affair.
5720403 5723364 Whoever she was she drove him<br />crazy.
5724741 5727118 I hated him so much for that.
5728077 5730288 I wanted to kill them both.
5730997 5735126 If I ever found out who she<br />was, I would rip her to pieces.
5735960 5739172 But now I see I should have<br />helped him.
5739756 5743885 I didn't know that he was<br />going to take his own life.
5745428 5746428 - Hey,
5747388 5748388 hey.
5750642 5752101 - Enough about me.
5753853 5755897 What's going on with you?
5755939 5757649 - Trish, I'm in love.
5761277 5762277 - Who is he?
5762612 5765740 - He's a detective and he's<br />everything
5766032 5767951 a woman could ever want.
5769077 5772455 He's strong and handsome, smart<br />and kind.
5775124 5777585 I just know that he's the one.
5778670 5780797 He even gave me this ring.
5781089 5783049 I call it my magic ring.
5783925 5785051 It's not an engagement ring
5785093 5789222 but I just know that he's<br />gonna pop the question soon.
5804946 5805905 - When we first came here
5805947 5809409 I showed you my engagement ring,<br />remember?
5811703 5813329 I can barely stand to look at it<br />anymore.
5813371 5814747 It's too painful.
5817166 5820128 I'm sure he's going to ask you<br />soon.
5820169 5823589 You're going to make a beautiful<br />bride.
5823631 5825341 The first day we met,
5826676 5829512 you were envious of me because I<br />had a man
5829554 5831431 and you were all alone.
5832390 5834100 Now it's the reverse.
5835935 5837895 Life is funny, isn't it?
5840606 5843359 - Trish, I'm sorry, I've gotta<br />go.
5843401 5846279 Would you like to walk out with<br />me?
5846571 5850033 - No, I'd like to stay and<br />finish my tea.
5850074 5851074 - All right.
5854078 5855371 Take care, love.
5855663 5858541 (light harp music)
5866341 5868551 (sighing)
5887403 5889530 (beeping)
5895870 5897580 - Hi Elaine, it's me.
5898206 5900083 Yeah, you left your ring here.
5900124 5903544 You're probably driving but<br />I'll drop it by on my way home.
5903586 5905213 See you in a minute.

6237461 6239088 Bitch, skank, whore.
6242675 6244719 (crying)
6253811 6255521 You'll burn for this.

6372012 6373973 Who are those new girls?
6374431 6376600 They can't dance at all.
6376642 6378102 And they're weird.
6383148 6387278 - I don't know, but the<br />customers really like 'em.
6387820 6389405 - They're friends of the<br />witches.
6389446 6391657 I seen them come in together<br />before.
6391699 6393325 - Yeah, the witches.
6394785 6396328 They're everywhere.
6397329 6398497 - One gin and tonic, Sam.
6398539 6400666 - Gin and tonic coming up.
6401375 6402293 - Did you read about the teacher
6402334 6404837 buried in the back yard of his<br />cabin?
6404879 6407131 They said it was done by the<br />witches.
6407172 6408632 - Oh yeah, I read about that.
6408674 6411802 They found all kinds of<br />witchcraft things on the grave.
6411844 6414096 - Yeah, I heard about that, too.
6414138 6415138 Creepy.
6416849 6420269 (applauding and cheering)
6430613 6432948 (jazzy music)
6432990 6434533 - Sit down, Elaine.
6442124 6445336 Elaine, the DNA came back from<br />the lab.
6447630 6450466 It connects you with Wayne<br />Peters.
6450507 6453093 (jazzy music)
6453135 6455763 Patricia Manning came by the<br />station.
6455804 6457514 With some things of yours.
6459391 6460601 Including this.
6462811 6466273 She said you drove her husband<br />to suicide.
6469735 6471612 - So, I was a bad girl.
6472321 6474531 Are you going to punish me?
6476325 6479453 - What sort of person are you,<br />Elaine?
6479495 6483123 What sort of sick mind<br />would do such things?
6483624 6485668 - Why are you so negative?
6485709 6487419 I didn't kill anyone.
6488128 6490339 Wayne died of heart failure
6490839 6493968 after a beautiful night of<br />lovemaking.
6494551 6498514 And Richard died because<br />he loved me too much.
6498555 6501225 These men weren't used to<br />the deep feelings of love
6501266 6503602 that they were experiencing with<br />me.
6503644 6506230 - Are you saying these men died<br />of love?
6506271 6507398 That's insane.
6508107 6511276 What about the spells and the<br />drugs?
6511318 6513821 Are you saying witchcraft<br />had nothing to do with it?
6513862 6517783 - Witchcraft is just a way<br />of concentrating energy.
6517825 6520828 It can only work with<br />what's already there.
6520869 6524498 I just use sex magic to create<br />love magic.
6524540 6528127 I didn't know how strong<br />the spells would be.
6528168 6531255 Sometimes it's almost scary<br />how strong the love gets.
6531296 6532296 - Love?
6533507 6535801 What do you know about love?
6536176 6540305 What you call love is a<br />borderline personality disorder
6541223 6542223 or worse.
6543017 6544601 - Don't diagnose me.
6545519 6548897 Maybe you're a narcissist who<br />can't love.
6550107 6551734 You think that I'm sick
6551775 6554945 because you've never loved like<br />I have.
6555404 6558282 Well, I would do anything for<br />love.
6560367 6564079 - That's right, you'll<br />never get enough love.
6565164 6568250 Even when a man loves<br />you so much it kills him,
6568292 6570169 it's not enough for you.
6570210 6572254 You're like a bottomless hole.
6572296 6576425 You doll yourself up and<br />do the Stepford Wife thing
6576800 6580554 thinking every man is<br />going to fall at your feet.
6580596 6584683 But your creepy little sexy<br />act doesn't work with me.
6587352 6588729 I don't love you.
6595194 6596987 - How can you stand there and<br />boast
6597029 6599239 about being immune to love?
6599865 6603994 Why does the genuine love of<br />a woman scare you so much?
6604578 6607956 You think that your way<br />is a superior way to live?
6607998 6610918 I know a lot of women who<br />feel the way that I do.
6610959 6614588 Only men make us work<br />so hard for your love.
6616423 6619718 If you would just love us for<br />ourselves,
6622429 6623555 but you won't.
6625599 6628227 My ex-husband was just like you.
6629144 6633273 He used to punish me by<br />withholding his love from me.
6633732 6637277 All my life I've been<br />tossed in the garbage
6638278 6641406 except when men wanted to use my<br />body.
6642991 6645869 So, I decided to find my own<br />power.
6646745 6650207 And I found that power through<br />witchcraft.
6651416 6654044 That means that I take<br />what I need from men
6654086 6656463 and not the other way around.
6659383 6661009 - I'm sorry, Elaine.
6663637 6665597 It won't work this time.
6666849 6669560 I'm afraid I'm going<br />to have to arrest you.
6669601 6670601 - What for?
6672146 6675440 Marrying a lover according to my<br />religion?
6675482 6677359 Seducing a married man?
6678443 6680362 I know 400 years ago you could<br />be burned
6680404 6683448 for a thing like that, but not<br />today.
6686785 6688162 - No, not burned,
6691039 6695169 but you'll be booked for<br />burying Wayne Peters illegally
6696086 6698046 and we'll find out more.
6699506 6703302 - Oh, that's the witch<br />who killed the teacher.
6704720 6707848 - Thou shalt not suffer a witch<br />to live.
6707890 6710100 (grunting)
6710934 6712436 (screaming)
6712477 6714897 - Burn the witch.
6714980 6716106 - [All] Burn the witch.
6716148 6718275 - Burn the witch, burn<br />the witch, burn the witch,
6718317 6725073 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6725157 6731705 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,

6767658 6768492 - Burn!
6768533 6769326 - Burn her.
6769368 6770160 - Burn.
6770202 6771202 Burn.
6796687 6797687 - Poor baby.
6798772 6800065 Poor, poor baby.
6806113 6809074 Don't worry, everything will be<br />okay
6811410 6813578 because I love you so much.
