28950 30060 - I'm starting a new life.
34250 38380 Up here where it's quiet and<br />clean among the redwoods.
39010 41220 And almost no one knows me.
78670 79670 Poor Jerry.
82630 86180 I had a nervous breakdown<br />after he left me.
89890 91770 They say I'm cured now.
94690 97650 But I still have intrusive<br />thoughts.
104650 108700 My therapist told me that<br />I'm not unusual at all.
109780 112750 People are abused all over the<br />world
112790 113790 every day
115120 116540 much worse than me
118670 120040 and they do fine.
165800 167840 - Your tail light's out, Miss.
167880 170850 - Oh, thank you for letting me<br />know.
173010 175430 Are you gonna write me a ticket?
175470 179600 - I'll let you go this time,<br />but make sure you get it fixed.
181020 182730 - Thank you, Officer.
184280 185820 - You drive safely.
210340 213300 - When Jerry left me,<br />I devoured everything
213350 216560 I could about how to get your<br />man back.
217140 221020 According to the experts,<br />men are very fragile.
224520 228650 They can get crushed down if<br />you assert yourself in any way.
230740 232950 You have to be very tricky.
278830 279790 - Elaine?
279830 280960 Hi, I'm Trish.
281000 282790 - Hi, Trish, it's nice to meet<br />you.
282830 284710 - Oh, you're so pretty.
285170 286750 Oh, um, I didn't mean anything.
286790 288340 I'm married and everything.
288380 290800 - No, I didn't think anything.
290840 294050 - Well, let me help you with<br />your bags.
294640 295640 Is this all you've got?
295680 296640 - For now.
296680 298810 My art supplies are<br />being shipped over later.
298850 300020 - So you're an artist?
300060 301060 - Yes, I am.
301680 303230 - I'm an interior decorator.
303270 304310 - Oh, really?
304600 305600 - Yes.
313200 314950 That's how I met Barbara.
314990 317200 I decorated this apartment.
317740 319490 It was lucky I still had the<br />keys.
319540 323410 Barbara didn't exactly<br />know when she'd be back.
335970 337550 How do you know Barbara?
337590 339810 - We used to dance<br />together in San Francisco.
339850 340890 - Oh, really?
348150 350270 Well, I hope you like the<br />apartment.
350320 353240 It's a bit garish but<br />Barbara wanted it that way.
353280 356280 She had me take all of the<br />colors from the Thoth Tarot deck
356320 358620 and she and her students did<br />a bunch of occult paintings
358660 359870 for me to hang.
360280 362910 She's into all that Wicca stuff.
368420 369790 Well, this is it.
374090 375970 - Oh, Trish, I love it.
376470 378010 It's just beautiful.
378050 379050 - Really?
379350 380640 Oh, I'm so glad.
381470 383060 I thought I may have overdone<br />it.
383100 385640 - Oh no, it's exactly my taste.
386600 387390 - You must be exhausted.
387440 389020 I'm sure you want to lie down.
389060 391400 - Actually, I was thinking<br />about getting a bite to eat.
391440 393480 Do you know of a place around<br />here?
393530 395070 - There's the Victorian Tea<br />Room.
395110 397700 We could go together, if<br />you don't mind the company.
397740 399370 - Oh, how fantastic.
400070 401410 Where can I freshen up?
401450 403200 - The bedroom is through there.
403240 405200 - I'll only be a moment.
438360 440070 - What a lovely room.
440660 441870 - Yes, isn't it?
441910 443580 I love Victoriana.
443620 446750 - Being here is like being<br />a princess in a fairy tale.
446790 449500 - Do you have fairy<br />princess fantasies, Elaine?
449540 450540 - Of course.
451000 452670 We may be grown women, but<br />underneath
452710 456840 we're just little girls<br />dreaming about being carried off
456880 459260 by a prince on a white horse.
459930 461550 - Yes, I suppose so.
461590 463720 It's ridiculous, isn't it?
469940 473440 - I don't think I've found<br />my Prince Charming yet,
473480 475730 but I think I found the formula.
475770 477210 You know, I've been<br />studying parapsychology
477230 481360 and I understand men so<br />much better than I used to.
483780 487910 If only I would have known<br />before what I know now.
490250 493040 Then Jerry would have never left<br />me.
493080 494210 - Who's Jerry?
494710 496000 - My ex-husband.
497630 501130 The day he left me was<br />the day that I died.
503590 506310 But then I was reborn as a<br />witch.
508720 511190 Barbara and Gahan brought me<br />back to life.
511230 515360 They taught me everything I<br />know about magic and about men.
516690 518440 Men are like children.
518900 521070 They're very easy to please
521400 524780 as long as we give them what<br />they want.
524820 525780 ♫ Tra la la la
525820 529120 ♫ Tra la la la la di da
532160 536290 ♫ I dreamed of a fairy<br />lady in a strange land
539880 544010 ♫ She captured the hearts<br />of all the boys and men
548720 551520 ♫ She wore a gown
552060 555600 ♫ Of pink and purple roses

564200 565240 - Where were we?
565280 569490 Oh, men, you said we need<br />to give them what they want.
569540 571410 Well, what do men want?
572080 575920 - Just a pretty woman to<br />love and to take care of them
575960 578710 and to make them feel like a man
578750 579900 and to give them total freedom
579920 582550 in whatever they wanna do or be.
583050 585260 - But what about what we want?
585300 586890 How are we going to be equals<br />with men
586930 590430 if we keep catering to all of<br />their needs?
590470 594810 - I think that if you want<br />love, you have to give love.
594850 598980 Giving men sex is a way of<br />unlocking their love potential.
599730 603610 - You sound as if you'd been<br />brainwashed by the patriarchy.
603650 607780 Your whole self-worth is<br />wrapped up in pleasing a man.
608070 610950 I'll admit, I used sex to get<br />this,
612450 614540 but I'm not proud of it.
614580 617580 A whole world doesn't<br />revolve around a man's needs.
617620 619840 If I gave Richard sex<br />every time he wanted it,
619880 621090 I'd be a wreck.
621460 622670 - Poor Richard.
623630 627760 He loves you and he wants<br />you and you torture him.
629600 632180 You have to give a man his<br />fantasy.
632220 635020 - His fantasy?
635060 636600 - Yes, his fantasy.
639100 641940 But what I'm really interested<br />in
641980 642980 is love.
645320 648200 You might say I'm addicted to<br />love.
649410 652490 I wonder if all women feel that<br />way?
652530 656040 - Well, it depends on<br />what you mean by love.
656080 657910 A husband isn't a prince,<br />Elaine,
657960 660290 and life isn't a fairy tale.
660330 662340 We have to face that fact.
662380 663380 - Why?
664000 665190 Maybe life could be a fairy tale
665210 667300 if you pleased your husband<br />more.
667340 670050 - I don't<br />need to please Richard.
670090 672180 Richard loves me for myself.
672220 673220 - Of course.
673850 676390 Perhaps you did find your Prince<br />Charming.
676430 677730 - Perhaps I did.
690990 691990 - Guess who.
692530 695580 - Richard, what are you doing<br />here?
696450 698080 This tea room is for ladies<br />only.
698120 700370 - Oh, I went to visit you at<br />work
700420 701630 and Julie said you were here.
701670 704210 I thought we could have lunch<br />together.
704250 707420 - Well, that's very sweet,<br />but I've already had my lunch.
707460 709340 Oh, uh, Richard, this is Elaine.
709380 712300 Elaine, this is my husband,<br />Richard.
712890 715140 - I've heard so much about you,<br />Richard.
715180 717770 - Nothing too horrible, I hope.
717810 719060 - On the contrary.
857360 858820 - Goddess, please,
861580 864040 send me a beautiful, sweet man
866000 868040 to love me as I love him.
873800 875420 To love me, love me,
880600 881600 love me,
883430 884430 love me,
886100 887100 love me,
888270 889270 love me,
890480 891480 love me,
892940 893940 love me.
914300 915760 Hi, are you Wendy?
916260 918680 - Yes, what can I do for you?
918720 919760 - I'm Elaine.
920090 921760 We spoke on the phone.
921800 924600 I make natural soaps<br />and candles and things.
924640 926020 - Elaine, right.
926060 927770 Thanks for coming by.
928230 929480 Mind if I have a look?
929520 930520 - Please do.
938030 939400 - These are nice.
943410 944410 Really nice.
946290 949160 I think these will do well in<br />the store.
949210 950750 - Then you'll take them?
950790 954500 - Let's start with these<br />and see how they do.
958010 960970 If these sell in the next<br />week or two, I'll order more.
961010 962010 Sound good?
962260 963640 - Yes, fantastic.
964050 965430 Thank you, Wendy.
965470 966680 - Sure, Elaine.
966970 968350 Bright blessings.
1008180 1010850 - People always<br />ask me why I'm a witch.
1010890 1014980 I tell them it's because I<br />want to have magical powers.
1015020 1017070 But it's not like it sounds.
1017110 1021240 All it is is using your<br />will to get what you want.
1056940 1057940 - Hi.
1058940 1059940 - Hi.
1061650 1064610 - It's a beautiful day.
1064650 1065700 - Yes, it is.
1067120 1069490 I love to be out in<br />nature on days like this.
1069530 1071330 - Oh, you like nature?
1071750 1072750 - Very much.
1073750 1076370 You seem like a nature type too.
1077040 1080300 I'll bet you like to<br />spend time in the woods.
1080340 1081630 - That's right.
1081670 1083090 How'd you know?
1083130 1084630 - I can just tell.
1084670 1087340 Nature is where your heart is.
1087390 1091350 City and people can get<br />to be too much for you.
1091390 1095520 - Whuh, that is a lot to get<br />from someone in a few seconds.
1097350 1099310 - I'm talented that way.
1100320 1103280 - Well, you're right about the<br />city.
1103740 1106150 In fact, I have a house out in<br />the woods
1106200 1108160 about an hour from here.
1108620 1111740 I like to go there whenever<br />I can to, you know,
1111790 1113370 just think and read.
1115460 1117120 - Do you take your wife up<br />there?
1117170 1119880 - No.
1120250 1121540 I'm not married.
1123130 1124440 - Well, you might at<br />least take a girl up there
1124460 1125800 once in a while.
1125840 1128550 - I do.
1128590 1130390 I do, once in a while.
1131600 1133390 - You wanna take a girl up there<br />now?
1137690 1139060 What do you mean?
1140770 1142520 - Well, I'm new in town
1142570 1146110 and I haven't seen much<br />of the nature around here.
1146150 1148450 I'll make you a nice dinner.
1149030 1153160 - Yes, okay, sure.
1153490 1156040 Uh, my car is right over there.
1157120 1158120 - Okay.
1159420 1160420 Let's go.
1208210 1211430 You know what I'd like to do<br />right now?
1217640 1219600 I'd like to make love<br />right here in the car
1219640 1221520 just like we were kids.
1224020 1225820 - Wait, wait.
1230110 1231240 You want some?
1233200 1234240 - What is it?
1234990 1236530 - Something I made.
1243920 1244920 - Mm.
1245540 1249170 Oh, wo, ho, ho, ho,<br />that is, that is strong.
1250720 1251720 - Finish it.
1262440 1264900 - Oh.
1270030 1272070 - No, Wayne, Wayne, stop.
1274030 1275030 Not here.
1275490 1276780 Let's go inside.
1289630 1291090 This is beautiful.
1296300 1298100 I'll start the dinner.
1340680 1341680 - Wow.
1348690 1350400 This looks delicious.
1353400 1354400 - To nature.
1373460 1376050 - This is really nice, isn't it?
1376920 1378590 I like to come up here a lot
1378630 1381220 at the end of the semester to<br />unwind.
1381260 1382600 - Are you a teacher?
1382640 1385310 - Yeah, I teach at the<br />university.
1385350 1387310 - Oh, what do you teach?
1388230 1389980 - English and French literature
1390020 1392730 with a focus on the 18th<br />century.
1393480 1395900 - So, you must be quite a<br />libertine.
1395940 1397070 - A libertine?
1398240 1399860 Why would you say that?
1399910 1401240 - Oh, you know.
1401280 1404790 All of the dangerous<br />liaisons, Fanny Hill stuff.
1404830 1406160 Not to mention Casanova.
1406200 1409790 - Well, there<br />were a lot of books written
1409830 1411460 in the 18th century.
1411500 1413040 - Well, is it true?
1413540 1415170 Are you a libertine?
1416460 1417460 - Yes I am.
1418470 1419510 I love women.
1420300 1422010 Does that bother you?
1422050 1423510 - On the contrary.
1428430 1429430 Oh, hmm,
1431690 1433480 I feel strange, dizzy.
1439280 1441990 What was in that drink you gave<br />me?
1442030 1445910 - Organic berries, vodka,<br />hallucinogenic herbs.
1447450 1449330 - Hallucinogenic herbs?
1451710 1452710 Oh, baby.
1453170 1454790 You are really wild.
1460340 1464350 - Would you mind if I made<br />myself more comfortable?
1464390 1465430 - Not at all.
1485280 1488580 ♫ La ♫
1490330 1491620 - What the hell?

1500670 1502970 - I always line my clothing.

1506890 1510060 Dark and quiet that you show the<br />world.
1511310 1513270 Who do you give that to?
1514600 1515600 The rainbow?
1516650 1518940 - I give the rainbow to you.

1570370 1571370 Look at you.

1733860 1736450 - Oh, Elaine, I feel so strange.
1739120 1742330 - It's all right, you're with<br />me, shhh.
1746210 1747210 - Elaine.
1749590 1753720 No woman has ever given<br />herself like that to me before.
1754340 1756550 - Life has been tough, huh?
1756930 1758310 - Yeah, in a way.
1763230 1766650 You're not like any other woman<br />I've met.
1766690 1768400 No games, no agendas.
1770780 1773740 You just seem to take life as it<br />is.
1775530 1778200 - Is there any other way to take<br />life?
1778240 1780950 - Well, the women I've been<br />with,
1782370 1784390 they all want you to make<br />a bunch of promises to 'em
1784420 1786880 as soon as you sleep with 'em.
1787750 1790920 But, how can you commit to someone<br />that you don't even know?
1790960 1791960 It's crazy.
1792720 1793920 - I know, baby.
1795220 1796220 I know.
1797930 1802060 - I never thought I wanted<br />to be tied down to anybody.
1802520 1806560 But it's just 'cause no<br />one was ever quite right.
1807150 1810940 All the women that I'm<br />attracted to physically
1811230 1813530 they're never bright enough.
1813900 1818160 And all the bright ones are<br />homely and don't arouse me.
1818200 1820990 - That seems like quite a<br />problem.
1821830 1824620 - It is.
1825410 1828040 I feel my whole life as a loner,
1828460 1831000 thinkin' I didn't need anybody.
1833010 1834970 But now I'm not so sure.
1835930 1836930 Oh, Elaine,
1838680 1842350 I have never felt real<br />love like this before.
1842930 1847190 - You're just having a<br />lot of emotions right now.
1847230 1849770 - Oh.
1850310 1851860 Elaine, I'm scared.
1854940 1858490 I'm not used to feeling<br />things so strongly.
1859030 1861080 I can't take it, I can't take<br />it.
1861120 1863620 Oh.
1865370 1869500 Elaine, I'm sick.
1870250 1871250 I'm sick.
1872880 1874670 - Hey, it's all right.
1877300 1878340 I've got you.
1879090 1880090 I love you.
1881680 1884310 And I'll always be here for you.
1886480 1888270 Try to get some sleep.
1897740 1899450 - Elaine.
1903120 1904910 Elaine, where are you?
1906620 1908410 Elaine, where are you?
1913170 1914710 - What a pussy.
1915590 1916590 What a baby.
1916920 1918920 I thought I'd found a real man,
1918970 1920890 but he's just like a little<br />girl.
1920930 1922640 - Elaine!
1923510 1924950 - No one was ever there for me
1924970 1927140 when I was crying my heart out.
1928680 1930730 No one ever comforted me.
1931400 1932400 No one.
2006510 2008310 - Good morning, Wayne.
2009220 2010270 - Hi, Elaine.
2016860 2018400 - Here, drink this.
2029080 2032370 - I had such horrible dreams<br />last night.
2032710 2035420 - What did you dream about,<br />baby.
2035830 2038090 - I dreamt that I was calling<br />your name
2038130 2040000 and you didn't answer.
2040050 2044170 I kept calling and calling,<br />but I couldn't find you.
2047340 2050220 Oh, Elaine, you love me, don't<br />you?
2052600 2053850 - Of course, I love you.
2053890 2058020 - Oh God, oh God, Elaine.
2063490 2064860 - Are you hungry?
2066910 2068950 - I don't know what I am.
2069320 2071790 - Well, try to get some sleep.
2073040 2074040 - Elaine.
2075910 2077290 Don't leave me.
2077330 2079540 - I'm not going anywhere, baby.
2079590 2081130 I'll be right here.
2108320 2109530 Wayne, wake up.
2110070 2111070 It's late.
2113580 2114580 Wayne.
2115660 2117330 Wayne, baby, wake up.
2119080 2120080 Wake up.
2121340 2122340 Wayne.
2198000 2200540 - Tampons aren't gross.
2200580 2203960 Women bleed and that's a<br />beautiful thing.
2205040 2209170 Do you know that most men have<br />never even seen a used tampon?
2215600 2218310 Part of me can be with Wayne<br />now.
2220060 2221060 Always.
2223900 2226110 I don't really mind death.
2226150 2228280 I've buried people before.
2229990 2231280 People I really cared about.
2236700 2240080 In the end we're all just<br />compost anyway.
2241710 2243580 Everything regenerates.
2247130 2249670 I'd like to come back as a cat.
2250670 2254050 I've been so depressed since my<br />cat died.
2254340 2258470 His name was Greymalkin,<br />but he was black and white.
2259770 2261560 He was my best friend.
2280660 2282960 - I give the rainbow to you.
2286000 2287000 Right now.
2387520 2388640 Just a minute.
2396360 2397360 Oh hi Trish.
2397900 2398900 Come on in.
2399070 2400200 - Hey, Elaine.
2400610 2401780 You look gorgeous.
2401820 2403490 I love what you've done with<br />your hair.
2403530 2404530 - Thank you.
2405450 2406660 What's up, honey?
2406700 2408010 - Well, I haven't been able to<br />reach you,
2408040 2409000 so I thought I'd come over
2409040 2411120 to see if everything was all<br />right.
2411170 2412170 - I'm fine.
2412670 2413670 Really.
2414960 2416710 Can I offer you something?
2416760 2419300 I just made some tea and cake.
2419340 2421130 - Just tea, thank you.
2433810 2435270 - Cream and sugar?
2435320 2437440 - No, I'm fine, thank you.
2453290 2456090 So, what have you been so busy<br />with?
2456130 2457250 A man, I hope.
2457670 2459300 - Yes, it was a man.
2460720 2462680 But, it didn't work out.
2463140 2464220 - I'm Sorry.
2464260 2467810 - Yes, it's a shame<br />and I really liked him.
2470640 2472350 I thought that he was the one.
2472390 2474350 - Well, maybe next time.
2475900 2478360 - Are you sure you won't have<br />some cake?
2478400 2480030 - Oh, no, thank you.
2480820 2484780 I just came over to check up<br />on you and to say good bye.
2484820 2485820 - Good bye?
2487160 2488830 Why, where are you going?
2488870 2492830 - Oh, just to Dallas for<br />a furniture convention.
2493250 2495420 - Is Richard going with you?
2495460 2497130 - No, it's just a business trip.
2497170 2501210 Richard will have to fend<br />for himself for awhile.
2535870 2538290 - Sam, give me two whiskeys on<br />the rocks.
2538340 2539840 - Sure thing, Jane.
2541670 2543130 Did you see the papers today?
2543170 2544170 - No, why?
2545010 2547180 - They found a body in the Eel<br />River.
2547220 2548220 - A murder?
2548850 2549850 - Maybe.
2550850 2554140 They found a symbol carved in<br />his chest.
2555730 2556730 Here.
2558730 2561690 - It's a pentagram.
2561730 2563860 - It's them witches again.
2564280 2567490 - That's what I was thinking<br />too, Lyle.
2569530 2572660 - So yeah, Barbara, that's<br />everything.
2572950 2576670 After Jerry died, the cops<br />wouldn't stop harassing me.
2576710 2578830 They couldn't prove anything.
2578880 2581800 They actually thought that I<br />killed him.
2581840 2583380 Can you believe it?
2584630 2588550 Anyways, San Francisco got<br />to be a really bad trip
2588590 2589800 after you left.
2591390 2594140 That's when I remembered you<br />had that extra apartment.
2594180 2596140 - Well, it was perfect timing.
2596180 2598520 I'm just sorry I wasn't here to<br />greet you.
2598560 2599730 That's all right.
2599770 2601570 Trish has been lovely.
2602190 2604610 And I've been getting<br />a lot of artwork done.
2604650 2606950 But I had this experience last<br />weekend
2606990 2608950 that really shook me up.
2611030 2612780 - Why, what happened?
2612830 2615870 - Well, I met this great-looking<br />guy.
2615910 2618250 And I used love magic on him.
2618290 2620830 Then he got really weird on me.
2621840 2625630 All these emotions started<br />flowing out of him.
2627470 2628930 Then he got really
2630300 2631300 sick.
2632430 2634560 - Well, guys can't handle<br />their emotions too well.
2634600 2637430 That's why they don't<br />like heavy conversations.
2637480 2639640 It was probably just too much<br />for him.
2639690 2643570 All the love and the great<br />sex that you were giving him.
2643610 2645980 - I guess that's what it was.
2646610 2648070 But, I don't know.
2649070 2651360 - Honey, you have to be more<br />careful.
2651410 2652840 Maybe you shouldn't be<br />messing with love spells
2652870 2655240 in the first place, you know.
2657410 2659120 - Merry Meet, Elaine.
2660210 2662250 - Bright blessings Gahan.
2681190 2684020 - I heard you discussing love<br />spells.
2684060 2685940 You do have to be careful,<br />Elaine.
2685980 2689780 Love spells never work the<br />way you think they will.
2689820 2693320 But on a lighter note, it's<br />wonderful to see you, Elaine.
2693370 2695620 What's it been now, a year?
2695660 2699500 We must celebrate this<br />reunion of dear friends.
2699540 2701830 Thank you, Goddess, everywhere,
2703880 2706460 for the blessings that we share.
2706500 2708710 - Blessed be, Hurrahya!
2711130 2712680 - Go home, witches.
2714300 2715300 Go home.
2716680 2717680 - Just ignore them.
2717720 2719390 They're always giving us<br />trouble.
2719430 2722140 - I didn't know this town<br />was hostile to witches.
2722190 2724440 - Well, it's certainly not San<br />Francisco.
2724480 2726900 But it's not bad for a small<br />town.
2726940 2728690 Not all of them embrace our<br />methods
2728730 2730570 of practicing witchcraft.
2730610 2734410 But, I don't see why we<br />ought to be so uptight now.
2734450 2737740 Back in the day, we all made<br />love freely
2738030 2742000 and put up Baphomet posters<br />and no one was dogmatic
2742040 2745540 about whether they were a witch<br />or a Satanist or a Thelemite
2745580 2748460 or a Druid or a Wiccan or<br />whatever.
2749420 2750630 And it was fun.
2752300 2754800 But our classes and circles<br />have been very popular.
2760850 2761730 - What have you been teaching?
2761770 2765060 - Let's see, I've got a<br />new class on sigil magic
2765100 2768610 and Barbara's got a new<br />class on organite alchemy.
2768650 2770940 Otherwise, we're still<br />teaching the staples,
2770980 2773780 energy grounding,<br />Earth-based spirituality,
2773820 2775610 pagan arts and crafts,
2775660 2779780 candle work, the spellcraft<br />master class, ancient mysticism,
2780160 2783710 herbs and spices, and<br />sex magic, of course.
2784370 2787170 - Oh, are you still teaching<br />that?
2787580 2791380 - Yes, in fact, we've invited<br />some girls here tonight
2791420 2795380 for a seminar about the<br />power of sexual dancing.
2796090 2800220 Dancing is such a powerful<br />thing for women and girls.
2800810 2802560 - Are you still dancing?
2802600 2804480 - Yeah, some of us dance<br />here on Amateur Night.
2804520 2805810 You should come.
2808310 2809310 - Hi, Barbara.
2809360 2810360 Hi, Gahan.
2810480 2811860 Sorry we're late.
2812530 2815990 - Hello lovely ladies, please<br />have a seat.
2817780 2821280 Elaine, this is Star and her<br />sister Moon.
2821330 2823330 They're our students for<br />tonight.
2823370 2825830 Girls, this is our dear friend<br />Elaine.
2825870 2826870 - Hi.
2827080 2828080 - Hi.
2829290 2830790 - I was just pointing out that<br />dancing
2830840 2833710 is a powerful thing for women<br />and girls.
2833760 2835260 We asked you to meet us here<br />tonight
2835300 2837760 so you could learn about that.
2839890 2842930 Do you see how powerful that<br />girl is?
2844060 2847140 These men would do anything for<br />her.
2847190 2851150 Wouldn't you like to have<br />that power yourselves?
2851940 2853400 Then let us begin.
2853980 2858110 All witches need to figure<br />out where their power lies.
2858150 2861160 And we feel that a woman's<br />greatest power
2861200 2862990 lies in her sexuality.
2863830 2867960 We don't view this power as<br />Satanic or anti-feminist,
2868540 2872630 but as a celebration of<br />woman as a natural creature.
2873090 2877130 An earthly body, a spiritual<br />essence, and a womb.
2879720 2882180 - The whole history of<br />witchcraft is interwoven
2882220 2885010 with the fear of female<br />sexuality.
2885470 2888230 They burned us at the<br />stake because they feared
2888270 2891520 the erotic feelings we elicited<br />in them.
2891560 2894860 Later, they used marriage<br />to hold us in bondage
2894900 2899030 and made us into servants,<br />whores, and fantasy dolls
2899490 2902030 never asking us what we wanted.
2902570 2905540 - They teach us that a<br />normative human being
2905580 2908370 is a hyper-rationalist, stoic<br />male
2908660 2912330 and that women's emotions<br />and intuitions are illnesses
2912380 2914170 that need to be cured.
2915210 2918800 And we believe that men<br />and women are different
2918840 2922890 and that true equality<br />lies in that difference.
2922930 2925890 - We strive for male/female<br />polarity and to regain
2925930 2927680 our primal power as goddesses.
2929350 2931560 We need to teach men how to love<br />us
2931600 2934360 using ways they can understand.
2934400 2936480 So goddesses, use perfume,
2937530 2939740 wear high heels and makeup,
2940740 2944030 learn to dress your<br />hair in attractive ways,
2944070 2948120 display flesh artfully,<br />and know what to conceal.
2949120 2951080 Be a mother and a lover.
2952250 2956380 Stand your ground, but always<br />let the man feel like a man.
2959340 2962470 - Use sex magic to destroy his<br />fear of you
2962510 2966050 and to open his heart to<br />the floodgates of love.
2966100 2969770 Only then will he begin to<br />see you as a human being
2969810 2972310 with all of your inner beauty.
2972350 2974730 Then, when his heart is open to<br />love,
2974770 2977730 you may do with him what you<br />will.
2998670 3001380 - I love you, Elaine.
3001710 3003760 You know that, don't you?
3006140 3007850 I love you very much.
3011140 3013770 But you need to be more careful.
3016350 3019480 Dinner was late three times this<br />week.
3020020 3022740 And that house is a total<br />pigsty.
3023780 3026990 Do you know that I found an old<br />hot dog
3027490 3029280 under the bed this morning?
3031910 3034870 And why don't you ever brush<br />your hair?
3034910 3039040 You need to take better care<br />of yourself and of the house.
3040210 3043170 I'm embarrassed to have people<br />over.
3043670 3045840 I've been really patient up<br />until now,
3045880 3048680 but you need to step up your<br />game.
3051180 3054100 - I have a<br />crazy bitch for a daughter.
3054140 3056850 What?
3057940 3059520 You're not crazy?
3059560 3062570 Well, if you're not<br />crazy then you're stupid.
3062610 3063400 Which is it?
3063440 3065950 Are you crazy or are you stupid?
3065990 3068200 And you could lose a few pounds.
3068240 3070700 You're looking a little fatty.
3073700 3077830 - Oh my God, Elaine,<br />you've lost so much weight.
3078120 3080500 You have such a hot body now.
3081630 3084800 Do you like it when I touch you<br />like this?
3084840 3085880 Or like this?
3089090 3090890 I wanna make you come.
3095220 3097390 - Don't be frightened, Elaine.
3097440 3099310 I would never hurt you.
3099770 3101900 I'm not the big, bad wolf.
3103020 3106570 You need to have perfect<br />love and perfect trust.
3144980 3147780 - Hast thou the courage to make<br />the essay?
3147820 3151950 - I have two words, perfect<br />love and perfect trust.
3170720 3173850 - Assist me to erect the ancient<br />altar
3174220 3177180 at which in days past all<br />worshiped.
3179180 3182650 For in the old times, a woman<br />was the altar.
3183860 3187110 And the sacred place was<br />the point within the center
3187150 3190440 of the circle, the origin of all<br />things.
3193910 3196370 Therefore, should we adore it.
3226980 3229110 - Good morning, Sergeant Griff.
3229150 3231240 Congratulations on your<br />promotion.
3231280 3232650 - Thanks, Connie.
3233320 3234950 Is there any coffee.
3235240 3236620 - Yeah, I just made some.
3236660 3239540 I made it just the way you like<br />it.
3240290 3242790 - Is there anything you don't do<br />well?
3242830 3246540 - Why don't you try me<br />sometime and find out?
3251840 3253590 - How's the coffee, Steve?
3253630 3255010 - Uh, too strong.
3257850 3259890 - Well, I like it strong.
3260470 3263730 Man's gotta stay awake<br />on the job after all.
3263770 3267150 - Why, have you been keeping<br />late nights?
3267190 3268190 - Maybe so.
3272240 3274030 - But, now that you've been<br />promoted,
3274070 3277070 maybe you ought to start<br />thinking about settling down.
3277110 3278570 - Me, you kidding?
3285040 3288750 - Sergeant Meadows, a<br />lady's here to see you.
3289040 3290500 - I'm Shelly Curtis.
3290540 3294670 I phoned about Wayne Peters,<br />the teacher who disappeared.
3295050 3296430 - Yes, of course.
3296930 3298970 Have a seat, Miss Curtis.
3301060 3304640 You say you think Mr. Peters<br />might have been kidnapped?
3304680 3308020 - Yes, no one's seen him for two<br />weeks.
3308060 3311820 I went by his house and<br />the mail's piled up.
3311860 3314820 We had lunch the day he<br />disappeared.
3315400 3319280 I saw him drive away with a<br />strange woman near the plaza.
3319320 3322290 - Do you have any idea where<br />he might have gone with her?
3322330 3323700 - Wayne used to spend weekends
3323740 3326540 up in a cabin he had in the<br />woods.
3328330 3330170 He used to take dates there.
3361820 3365040 - Oh, Jesus.

3386310 3387770 - Hey Griff, look.

3412170 3413580 We're going to have to dig,<br />Steve.
3413630 3414630 - I know.
3417460 3420760 ♫ La ♫
3421260 3423140 I think you should go<br />back to the house, Shelly.
3431890 3435400 ♫ La ♫
3449540 3450540 - Mmm, mmm,
3455460 3458250 this cake is absolutely<br />fantastic.
3458710 3460300 And what a great dinner.
3460340 3461340 - Thank you.
3462010 3463300 I enjoy cooking.
3464760 3467430 Hope you don't mind my calling<br />you.
3467470 3470430 Sometimes it's so hard to be<br />alone.
3470470 3471520 - Not at all.
3473060 3477190 I get a little lonely, too,<br />when Trish is out of town.
3484360 3486370 - How long have you<br />and Trish been married?
3486410 3488580 - 10 years this September.
3488620 3489620 - 10 years!
3491500 3493120 It's really amazing.
3495170 3499300 No one has ever loved me the<br />way you love Trish, no one.
3506550 3508680 - What about your husband?
3509100 3511310 - My husband never loved me.
3511350 3514390 He couldn't wait to get away<br />from me.
3515230 3516230 - I'm sorry.
3525820 3529950 Sometimes I think Trish would<br />like to get away from me, too.
3530830 3531830 - Poor baby.
3533290 3534580 Poor, poor baby.
3565150 3567700 So, tell me, what turns you on?
3569530 3573410 - What turns me on?
3573950 3576910 Wow, no one's ever asked me that<br />before.
3576960 3578000 Let me think.
3580380 3583090 You know what really turns me<br />on?
3583380 3584380 Flying.
3585090 3586090 - Flying?
3586380 3588260 - Yeah, flying a plane.
3588880 3591220 You don't know what kinda high<br />it is.
3591260 3594180 You're soarin' up there above<br />everything.
3594220 3595890 You're in control.
3595930 3597560 - Oh, how fantastic.
3598940 3600150 - It really is.
3601060 3605360 It's the only time I feel<br />really clear about things.
3605400 3609530 Sometimes I look at my life<br />and I wonder how I got here.
3614200 3615790 I feel like my life is slipping<br />away
3615830 3618250 and there's so many things I<br />haven't done.
3618290 3619290 - Like what?
3619540 3621130 - I've never had any sordid love<br />affairs
3621170 3623460 or gotten into any mischief.
3625090 3627130 I used to watch those<br />old Steve McQueen movies,
3627170 3630380 you know, the ones where<br />they'd rob a bank or something,
3630430 3632030 and I'd fantasize that I was one<br />of those
3632050 3636180 crazy kinda gangsters with a<br />sexy, messed up girl on my arm.
3637600 3641400 Or those Westerns, when<br />they'd shoot up a town
3641690 3644940 and then go visit the local<br />prostitutes.
3644980 3646980 It's sounds stupid, I know.
3647030 3648360 - No, it doesn't.
3650570 3651860 It's very sweet.
3653910 3654910 - Really?
3656910 3658790 Trish doesn't think so.
3659330 3662670 She just rolls her eyes<br />when I talk like this.
3662710 3666340 - That's because she<br />doesn't understand you.
3666670 3668880 I understand you perfectly.
3670970 3671970 - You do?
3672130 3673130 - Of course.
3674970 3677930 You wanna have a sordid love<br />affair.
3678850 3681560 You wanna get into some<br />mischief.
3737160 3738160 - Uh.
3755970 3756970 - Ho!
3784460 3785460 Who are you?
3786370 3788420 What are you doing to me?
3788960 3790670 - I'm the love witch.
3792090 3795630 I'm your ultimate fantasy.
3795670 3797090 - That's right.
3799300 3800300 That's right.
3807350 3809480 - Steve, I'm going out<br />to see that witch doctor.
3809520 3810520 - Who?
3810690 3811980 - Professor King.
3812020 3814740 He specializes in black<br />magic and witchcraft.
3814780 3815570 He might be able to help me
3815610 3817400 identify some of the items we<br />found.
3817450 3818660 - It's great.
3818700 3820370 Did you get the lab report?
3820410 3824040 - Yeah, yeah, it looks like<br />heart failure.
3824080 3827290 But the toxicology report<br />showed traces of Jimson weed
3827330 3831460 also known as Devil's weed, a<br />highly toxic hallucinogenic.
3832090 3833710 - It's unbelievable.
3834090 3835670 You want me to come with you?
3835710 3838380 - No, this will only take a few<br />minutes.
3838430 3841010 Can you order me a turkey<br />and avocado on whole wheat?
3841050 3842350 - Mustard, mayo?
3842930 3844640 - Yeah and cole slaw.
3845270 3846060 Thanks.
3846100 3847100 - Done.
3855860 3859200 - Ah, Sergeant Meadows, sorry<br />to have kept you waiting.
3859240 3861700 - Glad to meet you, Professor.
3864660 3867410 Professor, this is the<br />bottle we found in a grave
3867450 3871580 of Wayne Peters, the one<br />you read about in the paper.
3871630 3873170 - Interesting, yes.
3874090 3876550 Just as I thought.
3876590 3879470 The contents indicate<br />that it's a witch bottle.
3879510 3880680 - A witch bottle?
3880720 3881860 - Yes, witches used to make them
3881890 3884510 for protection against curses.
3884560 3888020 They'd take something personal<br />like bodily fluids or hair
3888060 3889890 along with herbs and something<br />sharp
3889940 3894110 like pins or broken glass<br />to scare away evil spirits.
3894150 3896170 Witch bottles have often been<br />found buried in the hearths
3896190 3897820 of very old houses.
3897860 3900530 - Would it be safe to assume<br />that the person who made this
3900570 3901570 was a witch?
3902070 3903570 - It's very likely.
3903620 3905870 Witchcraft, long dormant<br />in civilized places,
3905910 3908290 has taken root again in cities.
3908330 3910290 There have several rituals per<br />year.
3910330 3914540 One of them, Samhain,<br />corresponds of our Halloween.
3914590 3918380 Other rituals celebrate<br />Summer Solstice, Litha,
3918420 3922220 or the Winter Solstice,<br />which they call Imbolg.
3925550 3928270 Here the members of a coven<br />kiss the devil's behind
3928310 3931100 in a mockery of Christian<br />rituals.
3932980 3936270 Here, a satanic cult sacrifices<br />a child.
3937650 3939150 - Does this stuff really go on<br />today?
3939190 3940320 - Yes, indeed.
3941070 3944240 Those who practice human<br />sacrifice are the black witches
3944280 3947240 who perform blood rituals<br />to gain demonic powers
3947280 3950620 and to bind their members<br />together in secrecy.
3950660 3952960 Law has been trying to root<br />out these cults for decades
3953000 3955080 but they've been unsuccessful.
3955130 3957250 Then there are the<br />white witches or Wiccans
3957290 3959710 who commune in nature<br />in the healing spirit
3959760 3962880 and who have a strict law<br />that forbids harming others.
3962930 3965090 Every city and rural<br />village today has pockets
3965140 3966600 of both black and white witches
3966640 3969180 who practice the ancient rites.
4000170 4004300 - I invoke and call upon<br />thee, Mighty Mother of us all.
4006010 4010140 I invoke thee to descend upon<br />the body of this thy servant
4011680 4012810 and priestess.
4014940 4017350 - Of the Mother Darksome and<br />Divine
4017400 4019940 here I charge you in this sign.
4022780 4026110 - Listen to the words of the<br />Great Mother.
4028370 4031790 She, who of old, who<br />was also called Artemis,
4031830 4034540 Aphrodite, Cerridwen, Diana,<br />Isis,
4037500 4039460 and by many other names.
4043130 4045510 - Whenever ye have need of<br />anything,
4045550 4049680 then ye shall assemble in some<br />secret place and adore me,
4050680 4052970 who am Queen of all witches.
4053850 4057690 There shall ye assemble,<br />ye who are fain to learn
4057730 4058730 all sorcery.
4060110 4064360 Behold all acts of love and<br />pleasure are my rituals.
4064400 4068280 Behold I have been with<br />thee from the beginning
4068320 4072450 and I am that which is<br />attained at the end of desire.
4076160 4080210 Bagabi lacha bachabe.
4081710 4085670 Lamac cahi achababe.
4085960 4089930 Hurrahya! Hurrahya!
4095180 4096180 - Arise.
4099980 4104020 Eko, Eko, Azarak
4104400 4106360 Eko, Eko, Zomelak
4107110 4109070 Eko, Eko, Cernunnos
4109110 4111740 Eko, Eko, Aradia!
4137970 4139770 - You're looking a little<br />tense tonight, love.
4139810 4141270 What's the matter?
4142520 4146650 - Oh nothing, just my usual<br />roller coaster love life.
4146980 4149070 - Well, have a drink and relax.
4149110 4152570 Nothing's that dire, at least<br />not for you.
4152860 4156950 It's an entirely different<br />story for your victims.
4158580 4159830 - What victims?
4159870 4163580 - There's no need to play<br />Miss Innocent with me, dearie.
4163630 4165630 - Please, don't touch me.
4171630 4172970 - Bright blessings, Barbara.
4173010 4174390 - Merry meet, Elaine.
4174430 4175600 How's it going?
4176100 4177600 - I'm back in the dating pool<br />again.
4177640 4178930 - What happened?
4179770 4181950 I thought you were crazy about<br />that new guy you were seeing,
4181980 4183270 the married man.
4183650 4185360 - No, I broke it off.
4185770 4189070 He just became really obsessive,<br />morose,
4190110 4192820 and his aura became really<br />murky.
4193780 4196990 He didn't even wanna make love<br />anymore.
4197030 4201160 He became just like a woman,<br />crying at every little thing.
4201750 4203540 There was no polarity.
4204210 4206080 But, I should have known.
4206130 4207250 He's a Pisces.
4238700 4239700 - Richard?
4243000 4244100 - I thought I told you<br />never to interrupt me
4244120 4245500 when I'm working.
4246370 4247750 What do you want?
4248960 4250980 - I just wanted to let you<br />know that I'm going to bed
4251000 4252760 and I'm taking a pill.
4271360 4273150 Are you coming to bed?
4273440 4274440 - No.
4280370 4282660 I have some more work to do.
4285750 4288710 - All right, see you tomorrow,<br />then.

4383220 4385810 - Sergeant Griff Meadows<br />of the Police Department.
4385850 4387850 I'd like to ask you a few<br />questions.
4387890 4388890 - Okay.
4398860 4401570 - Does this look familiar to<br />you?
4404700 4406450 - It's a witch bottle.
4407660 4409750 - Do you have any idea<br />who could have made it?
4409790 4411160 - No, no I don't.
4414880 4417300 - Ever seen any of these in here<br />before?
4417340 4419420 - Yeah, we have some witch<br />bottles.
4419460 4420920 I'll show you one.
4428140 4429140 Here's one.
4432940 4434730 - How common are these bottles?
4434770 4436120 - I've never seen 'em in here<br />before until
4436150 4439030 a girl started supplying 'em to<br />us.
4440320 4441860 - Who is this girl?
4443240 4446120 - Her name is Elaine, Elaine<br />Parks.
4473310 4474310 - Who is it?
4475980 4479110 - Sergeant Meadows, Police<br />Department.
4484320 4486510 Sorry to bother you, ma'am,<br />but I'm investigating a case
4486530 4489580 and I just wanted to<br />ask you a few questions.
4489620 4490660 - About what?
4491410 4493870 - Well, it's a potential<br />homicide case.
4493910 4495620 Just a routine check.
4495920 4499130 I thought you might be able to<br />help us.
4499590 4500590 - Of course.
4502670 4504720 Please come in, Sergeant.
4511760 4514390 So you say there was a homicide.
4514810 4515850 How horrible.
4517100 4518480 Who was killed?
4518520 4520730 - A man named Wayne Peters.
4521400 4523030 Did you know Wayne Peters?
4523070 4524070 - No.
4526740 4528740 - Here's a picture of him.
4528780 4530280 Ever seen him before?
4530330 4531330 - No.
4531990 4533910 I guess I can't help you,<br />Sergeant.
4533950 4534790 Good bye.
4534830 4536290 - Ms. Parks, wait.
4543130 4546840 Have you ever seen<br />anything like this before?
4547220 4549050 - It's a Magic Bottle.
4549090 4550470 I made it myself.
4551600 4554600 - Have you ever seen one<br />containing urine?
4554640 4555640 - Urine?
4556850 4557850 No.
4568490 4572620 - We found this bottle containing<br />urine and a used tampon
4573870 4576250 on the grave of Wayne Peters.
4578580 4582210 - Will you excuse me<br />for a moment, Sergeant?
4587720 4590090 - Ms. Parks, are you a witch?
4590470 4591470 - Yes, I am.
4592140 4594140 Is there a law against that?
4594180 4597980 - I guess not, not unless<br />you do something wrong.
4598020 4600270 - Do you think that being<br />a witch makes me evil,
4600310 4602190 capable of murder even?
4602980 4605780 - No, I wasn't trying to<br />imply...
4605820 4608990 - Sergeant Meadows, do<br />you know what it's like
4609030 4610410 to really suffer?
4611990 4613410 You have to fight and fight
4613450 4616540 until you're too exhausted to go<br />on.
4616580 4619540 Witchcraft is my religion,<br />Sergeant.
4620080 4624340 And this religion, which is<br />older than your Christianity,
4624380 4625500 saved my life.
4640230 4643860 - Ms. Parks, I'm sorry<br />if I've offended you.
4646230 4647610 I didn't realize.
4651200 4654160 - That's all right, Sergeant<br />Meadows.
4659620 4661580 - You can call me Griff.
4662920 4663920 - Griff?
4667090 4669380 I know I've seen you before.
4671130 4673090 I just don't know where.
4674220 4676430 - I have that same feeling.
4677140 4678140 - I know.
4682390 4684690 You're the man in the cards.
4686060 4687270 You're my fate.
4688610 4691400 - What do you mean, I'm your<br />fate?
4691740 4694490 - I did a Celtic Cross reading.
4694530 4697910 For my future card I got Knight<br />of Wands.
4700080 4704250 Always felt that if that card<br />showed up in a future reading,
4704290 4707790 I would soon meet the man<br />that I'm going to marry.
4707840 4711630 But, the man that I marry<br />has to love animals.
4711670 4713880 Do you like animals, Griff?
4714430 4716510 - Why yes, I love animals.
4717430 4719470 In fact, a friend of<br />mine has a couple horses
4719510 4721100 I'm very fond of.
4721140 4723770 You know, tomorrow is my day off
4724390 4727440 and it's supposed to be quite<br />nice out.
4727480 4731480 Maybe I'll get away from<br />the city and do some riding.
4731530 4733820 Do you like to ride, Elaine?
4762390 4763390 Whoa.
4788420 4791790 - Oh Patchouli, you're such a<br />sweetheart.
4802470 4803770 - How's my girl?
4804640 4805980 - Am I your girl?
4806560 4808190 - For today you are.
4809480 4810910 You're my girl and there's<br />nobody around
4810940 4812650 to tell me otherwise.
4814570 4815570 - Except me.
4816900 4818490 - And what's that supposed to<br />mean?
4818530 4821740 - Nothing.
4822410 4824540 Kiss me.
4835210 4836800 - What's that sound?
4837340 4838550 - I don't know.
4839180 4840180 Let's go see.
4923430 4926930 - Now is the time of the Summer<br />Solstice.
4926970 4930060 The strength of the Oak King is<br />waning.
4930100 4933230 And the Holly King stands<br />ready to challenge him
4933270 4935980 for the hand of the Green<br />Maiden.
4937940 4939820 - Let the battle begin.
4945410 4946820 - Your season is over old man.
4947700 4948700 - Oh never.
4955880 4957210 - I will have her.
4957250 4958310 - Never have her.
4959170 4960170 - Never.
4964430 4966930 - Holly King, I name you the<br />victor.
4966970 4968970 The Green Maiden is yours.
4969010 4970010 - M'lady.
4971560 4972560 Come on.
4978980 4979980 - Elaine.
4980940 4982320 - You know these people?
4982360 4984110 - Well yes, in a way.
4984150 4986360 - All hail, fair Lord and Lady.
4986410 4988370 Welcome to our little gathering.
4988410 4989410 - All hail.
4990580 4992180 - We are the good people<br />of the Renaissance
4992200 4996330 and Medieval players and we<br />are celebrating the Midsummer.
4996370 4997830 Won't you join us?
4998210 5000420 - To be sure, fair consorts.
5008050 5009800 - They are charming, are they<br />not?
5009850 5011640 - Yes, quite charming.
5012220 5014600 - I see two people in love.
5014640 5016850 This calls for a wedding.
5016890 5017850 - A wedding?
5017900 5020110 - Yes, a mock wedding, if you<br />will.
5020150 5022270 To honor the gods of love.

5227690 5229150 - Now, ye are wed.
5236860 5240620 - I'm so happy for you,<br />Elaine, he's adorable.
5272650 5274320 - I'm not in love.
5274360 5276200 It's not that I don't have<br />sentiment,
5276240 5278110 it's just that love is soft.
5278160 5280200 You need guts in this business.
5280240 5282510 I've seen guys get shot to<br />death because they fell in love
5282530 5284160 and got soft inside.
5284790 5286460 I want an heir some day
5286500 5288080 and then I would need to have a<br />wife,
5288120 5290290 but love is something else.
5290330 5293130 A man can get destroyed<br />by things like that.
5293170 5295710 It's like he's not even a man<br />anymore.
5295760 5297970 I never wanna get like that.
5299130 5301760 - When you really love him,
5301800 5305470 it's like fireworks and<br />nothing else matters.
5306270 5308390 You love all the little quirks<br />about him.
5308440 5310810 The way he slurps his cereal.
5311810 5314150 The way his mouth is a little<br />crooked.
5314190 5318280 Those details about him<br />become your whole life.
5318320 5321870 Something inside you<br />opens up like a flower
5322570 5325910 and you realize that you<br />have more love to give
5325950 5328830 than you ever thought was<br />possible.
5329580 5331960 'Cause the more you know him,
5333210 5335000 the more you love him.
5336380 5337980 - The more<br />you get to know a woman,
5338010 5340590 the less you can feel about her.
5340630 5343180 At first, she's this<br />incredible object of mystery
5343220 5346520 who fulfills all you're wildest<br />fantasies.
5346560 5349560 Then she starts to reveal little<br />flaws
5349600 5353480 and after a while, just<br />gets pretty hard to care.
5353520 5357070 Feminine ideal only<br />exists in a man's mind.
5358240 5360950 No woman could ever fulfill it.
5360990 5364120 And sometimes, when she<br />tries to love you more,
5364160 5368120 give you more, you feel<br />like you're suffocating,
5369460 5371170 drowning in estrogen.
5372580 5374460 The most awful feeling.
5382760 5384930 - Dinner tonight, Griff?
5384970 5387260 - Um, can't tonight, Connie.
5389220 5390520 Some other time.
5396730 5397880 - Hey Griff, I got more<br />information
5397900 5399490 on that Elaine Parks girl.
5399530 5401780 - You leave it on my desk.
5401820 5403030 - Don't you wanna hear it?
5403070 5406450 - Steve, Captain wants<br />us to lay off the case.
5406490 5407870 - Are you serious?
5407910 5411540 - He says we have a policy<br />of leaving the witches alone.
5411580 5413960 He says they've lived<br />in this town a long time
5414000 5415790 and he doesn't like to mess with<br />them.
5415830 5417630 - Even if they murder?
5418920 5420320 - He says he's satisfied<br />that Wayne's death
5420340 5421880 was a heart attack.
5422510 5423680 I think so too.
5427470 5429970 - Has everyone gone crazy around<br />here?
5430020 5433140 Let me at least tell you what I<br />found.
5438110 5440860 Now, Elaine used to run<br />an organic beauty store
5440900 5442860 in Berkeley with her husband,<br />Jerry.
5442900 5444610 Two years later they were<br />divorced
5444660 5446200 and Elaine moved to San<br />Francisco
5446240 5448370 to start dancing at a burlesque<br />club
5448410 5451830 where she got involved with a<br />witch coven.
5459250 5461460 The coven broke up<br />after police questioning
5461510 5464130 when some of it's members<br />died mysteriously.
5464170 5468300 Soon after, Elaine's ex-husband<br />died of a drug overdose
5469100 5472680 shortly before he was planning<br />to remarry.
5472720 5474270 The police questioned Elaine
5474310 5477060 but they couldn't find enough to<br />hold her.
5477100 5479860 - Well, if the San Francisco<br />Police couldn't find anything,
5479900 5481820 what happened there is<br />none of our business.
5481860 5483530 - Are you serious?
5483570 5485990 - I'd say this woman is<br />a dangerous character
5486030 5488070 and you better watch her.
5488780 5490740 - You mean because she's a<br />witch?
5490780 5492620 That doesn't mean anything.
5492660 5496670 - No, her husband died of a<br />drug he'd never taken before.
5496710 5498100 And did you ever find where<br />Wayne Peters
5498130 5499840 got the Devil's weed?
5500750 5503130 - I questioned Ms. Curtis about<br />that.
5503170 5506090 There was Devil's weed<br />growing near his cabin.
5506130 5508800 Apparently, he experimented<br />often with drugs.
5508840 5510930 - Come on Griff, can't<br />you connect the dots?
5510970 5512310 We have a possible murder here
5512350 5514980 and Elaine is our only suspect.
5515020 5517350 - I told you, we're laying off<br />her.
5517390 5520110 - Because of orders or because<br />you're in love with her?
5520150 5521520 - Who says I'm in love with her?
5521570 5522900 Get the hell off my back.
5528280 5531990 - You're out of line,<br />Griff, way out of line.
5566990 5567990 - Richard.
5570530 5571530 Richard!
5573080 5574080 Richard!
5574490 5575490 Richard!
5622710 5624750 - Thank you for meeting me,<br />Elaine.
5624790 5627670 It's not good for me to be alone<br />too much.
5627710 5629260 I know you're busy.
5629300 5630300 - Of course.
5630880 5632260 I wanted to come.
5634510 5638220 - I can't help but blaming<br />myself for what happened.
5638270 5640480 - You can't blame yourself.
5640850 5643480 You were a good wife to Richard.
5645110 5646400 - I tried to be.
5648610 5651070 I tried so hard to please him,
5652200 5654410 but I should have tried harder.
5654450 5658580 He wanted a certain type of<br />woman, someone I could never be.
5661200 5662910 Maybe you were right.
5663500 5666790 Maybe you should give a man his<br />fantasy.
5668460 5672340 I thought that was so<br />awful when you said that.
5672840 5674800 Maybe I was being naive,
5675340 5678640 but I really thought he loved me<br />for me.
5680100 5681890 But now, now I wish...
5686650 5689780 - You have to stop torturing<br />yourself.
5690110 5691650 You have to let go.
5692820 5696320 Remember how he changed<br />after my Dallas trip?
5696370 5699830 I think that's when he<br />started having that affair.
5699870 5702830 Whoever she was she drove him<br />crazy.
5704210 5706580 I hated him so much for that.
5707540 5709750 I wanted to kill them both.
5710460 5714590 If I ever found out who she<br />was, I would rip her to pieces.
5715430 5718640 But now I see I should have<br />helped him.
5719220 5723350 I didn't know that he was<br />going to take his own life.
5724890 5725890 - Hey,
5726850 5727850 hey.
5730110 5731570 - Enough about me.
5733320 5735360 What's going on with you?
5735400 5737110 - Trish, I'm in love.
5740740 5741740 - Who is he?
5742080 5745210 - He's a detective and he's<br />everything
5745500 5747420 a woman could ever want.
5748540 5751920 He's strong and handsome, smart<br />and kind.
5754590 5757050 I just know that he's the one.
5758140 5760260 He even gave me this ring.
5760550 5762510 I call it my magic ring.
5763390 5764520 It's not an engagement ring
5764560 5768690 but I just know that he's<br />gonna pop the question soon.
5784410 5785370 - When we first came here
5785410 5788870 I showed you my engagement ring,<br />remember?
5791170 5792790 I can barely stand to look at it<br />anymore.
5792840 5794210 It's too painful.
5796630 5799590 I'm sure he's going to ask you<br />soon.
5799630 5803050 You're going to make a beautiful<br />bride.
5803100 5804810 The first day we met,
5806140 5808980 you were envious of me because I<br />had a man
5809020 5810900 and you were all alone.
5811860 5813570 Now it's the reverse.
5815400 5817360 Life is funny, isn't it?
5820070 5822820 - Trish, I'm sorry, I've gotta<br />go.
5822870 5825740 Would you like to walk out with<br />me?
5826040 5829500 - No, I'd like to stay and<br />finish my tea.
5829540 5830540 - All right.
5833540 5834840 Take care, love.
5875340 5877050 - Hi Elaine, it's me.
5877670 5879550 Yeah, you left your ring here.
5879590 5883010 You're probably driving but<br />I'll drop it by on my way home.
5883050 5884680 See you in a minute.
5965800 5967470 ♫ La

6216930 6218550 Bitch, skank, whore.
6233280 6234990 You'll burn for this.
6245330 6247120 - Crash, crash, crash.

6307770 6310480 Even should they strive to flee
6310520 6313060 they'll cling for all eternity.
6324910 6325910 - Scotch.
6342890 6344640 - Bottle o' beer, Sam.
6351480 6353440 Who are those new girls?
6353900 6356070 They can't dance at all.
6356110 6357570 And they're weird.
6362610 6366740 - I don't know, but the<br />customers really like 'em.
6367290 6368870 - They're friends of the<br />witches.
6368910 6371120 I seen them come in together<br />before.
6371160 6372790 - Yeah, the witches.
6374250 6375790 They're everywhere.
6376790 6377960 - One gin and tonic, Sam.
6378000 6380130 - Gin and tonic coming up.
6380840 6381760 - Did you read about the teacher
6381800 6384300 buried in the back yard of his<br />cabin?
6384340 6386600 They said it was done by the<br />witches.
6386640 6388100 - Oh yeah, I read about that.
6388140 6391270 They found all kinds of<br />witchcraft things on the grave.
6391310 6393560 - Yeah, I heard about that, too.
6393600 6394600 Creepy.
6412460 6414000 - Sit down, Elaine.
6421590 6424800 Elaine, the DNA came back from<br />the lab.
6427100 6429930 It connects you with Wayne<br />Peters.
6432600 6435230 Patricia Manning came by the<br />station.
6435270 6436980 With some things of yours.
6438860 6440070 Including this.
6442280 6445740 She said you drove her husband<br />to suicide.
6449200 6451080 - So, I was a bad girl.
6451790 6454000 Are you going to punish me?
6455790 6458920 - What sort of person are you,<br />Elaine?
6458960 6462590 What sort of sick mind<br />would do such things?
6463090 6465130 - Why are you so negative?
6465170 6466880 I didn't kill anyone.
6467590 6469800 Wayne died of heart failure
6470300 6473430 after a beautiful night of<br />lovemaking.
6474020 6477980 And Richard died because<br />he loved me too much.
6478020 6480690 These men weren't used to<br />the deep feelings of love
6480730 6483070 that they were experiencing with<br />me.
6483110 6485700 - Are you saying these men died<br />of love?
6485740 6486860 That's insane.
6487570 6490740 What about the spells and the<br />drugs?
6490780 6493290 Are you saying witchcraft<br />had nothing to do with it?
6493330 6497250 - Witchcraft is just a way<br />of concentrating energy.
6497290 6500290 It can only work with<br />what's already there.
6500330 6503960 I just use sex magic to create<br />love magic.
6504010 6507590 I didn't know how strong<br />the spells would be.
6507630 6510720 Sometimes it's almost scary<br />how strong the love gets.
6510760 6511760 - Love?
6512970 6515270 What do you know about love?
6515640 6519770 What you call love is a<br />borderline personality disorder
6520690 6521690 or worse.
6522480 6524070 - Don't diagnose me.
6524980 6528360 Maybe you're a narcissist who<br />can't love.
6529570 6531200 You think that I'm sick
6531240 6534410 because you've never loved like<br />I have.
6534870 6537750 Well, I would do anything for<br />love.
6539830 6543540 - That's right, you'll<br />never get enough love.
6544630 6547720 Even when a man loves<br />you so much it kills him,
6547760 6549630 it's not enough for you.
6549680 6551720 You're like a bottomless hole.
6551760 6555890 You doll yourself up and<br />do the Stepford Wife thing
6556270 6560020 thinking every man is<br />going to fall at your feet.
6560060 6564150 But your creepy little sexy<br />act doesn't work with me.
6566820 6568190 I don't love you.
6574660 6576450 - How can you stand there and<br />boast
6576490 6578700 about being immune to love?
6579330 6583460 Why does the genuine love of<br />a woman scare you so much?
6584040 6587420 You think that your way<br />is a superior way to live?
6587460 6590380 I know a lot of women who<br />feel the way that I do.
6590420 6594050 Only men make us work<br />so hard for your love.
6595890 6599180 If you would just love us for<br />ourselves,
6601890 6603020 but you won't.
6605060 6607690 My ex-husband was just like you.
6608610 6612740 He used to punish me by<br />withholding his love from me.
6613200 6616740 All my life I've been<br />tossed in the garbage
6617740 6620870 except when men wanted to use my<br />body.
6622460 6625330 So, I decided to find my own<br />power.
6626210 6629670 And I found that power through<br />witchcraft.
6630880 6633510 That means that I take<br />what I need from men
6633550 6635930 and not the other way around.
6638850 6640470 - I'm sorry, Elaine.
6643100 6645060 It won't work this time.
6646310 6649030 I'm afraid I'm going<br />to have to arrest you.
6649070 6650070 - What for?
6651610 6654910 Marrying a lover according to my<br />religion?
6654950 6656820 Seducing a married man?
6657910 6659830 I know 400 years ago you could<br />be burned
6659870 6662910 for a thing like that, but not<br />today.
6666250 6667630 - No, not burned,
6670500 6674630 but you'll be booked for<br />burying Wayne Peters illegally
6675550 6677510 and we'll find out more.
6678970 6682770 - Oh, that's the witch<br />who killed the teacher.
6684190 6687310 - Thou shalt not suffer a witch<br />to live.
6691940 6694360 - Burn the witch.
6694450 6695570 - Burn the witch.
6695610 6697740 - Burn the witch, burn<br />the witch, burn the witch,
6697780 6704540 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6704620 6711170 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6711250 6715930 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6716010 6721220 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6721310 6727140 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6727230 6733530 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6733610 6735820 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6735860 6739120 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6739160 6742120 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6742160 6746040 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch.
6747120 6747960 - Burn!
6748000 6748790 - Burn her.
6748830 6749630 - Burn.
6749670 6750670 Burn.
6776150 6777150 - Poor baby.
6778240 6779530 Poor, poor baby.
6785580 6788540 Don't worry, everything will be<br />okay
6790880 6793040 because I love you so much.
