28988 30090 - I'm starting a new life.
34285 38414 Up here where it's quiet and<br />clean among the redwoods.
39040 41250 And almost no one knows me.
78705 79704 Poor Jerry.
82667 86212 I had a nervous breakdown<br />after he left me.
89924 91801 They say I'm cured now.
94721 97681 But I still have intrusive<br />thoughts.
104689 108734 My therapist told me that<br />I'm not unusual at all.
109819 112780 People are abused all over the<br />world
112822 113822 every day
115158 116575 much worse than me
118703 120079 and they do fine.
165833 167877 - Your tail light's out, Miss.
167919 170880 - Oh, thank you for letting me<br />know.
173049 175467 Are you gonna write me a ticket?
175510 179638 - I'll let you go this time,<br />but make sure you get it fixed.
181057 182766 - Thank you, Officer.
184310 185853 - You drive safely.
210378 213339 - When Jerry left me,<br />I devoured everything
213381 216592 I could about how to get your<br />man back.
217176 221055 According to the experts,<br />men are very fragile.
224559 228687 They can get crushed down if<br />you assert yourself in any way.
230773 232983 You have to be very tricky.
278863 279822 - Elaine?
279864 280990 Hi, I'm Trish.
281032 282825 - Hi, Trish, it's nice to meet<br />you.
282867 284743 - Oh, you're so pretty.
285203 286787 Oh, um, I didn't mean anything.
286829 288372 I'm married and everything.
288414 290833 - No, I didn't think anything.
290875 294086 - Well, let me help you with<br />your bags.
294670 295671 Is this all you've got?
295713 296672 - For now.
296714 298841 My art supplies are<br />being shipped over later.
298883 300050 - So you're an artist?
300092 301092 - Yes, I am.
301719 303262 - I'm an interior decorator.
303304 304346 - Oh, really?
304638 305638 - Yes.
313230 314982 That's how I met Barbara.
315024 317234 I decorated this apartment.
317776 319528 It was lucky I still had the<br />keys.
319570 323449 Barbara didn't exactly<br />know when she'd be back.
336003 337588 How do you know Barbara?
337629 339840 - We used to dance<br />together in San Francisco.
339882 340924 - Oh, really?
348182 350309 Well, I hope you like the<br />apartment.
350351 353270 It's a bit garish but<br />Barbara wanted it that way.
353312 356315 She had me take all of the<br />colors from the Thoth Tarot deck
356357 358650 and she and her students did<br />a bunch of occult paintings
358692 359902 for me to hang.
360319 362946 She's into all that Wicca stuff.
368452 369828 Well, this is it.
374124 376001 - Oh, Trish, I love it.
376502 378045 It's just beautiful.
378087 379087 - Really?
379380 380672 Oh, I'm so glad.
381507 383092 I thought I may have overdone<br />it.
383133 385677 - Oh no, it's exactly my taste.
386637 387429 - You must be exhausted.
387471 389056 I'm sure you want to lie down.
389098 391433 - Actually, I was thinking<br />about getting a bite to eat.
391475 393519 Do you know of a place around<br />here?
393560 395104 - There's the Victorian Tea<br />Room.
395145 397731 We could go together, if<br />you don't mind the company.
397773 399400 - Oh, how fantastic.
400109 401443 Where can I freshen up?
401485 403237 - The bedroom is through there.
403278 405239 - I'll only be a moment.
438397 440107 - What a lovely room.
440691 441900 - Yes, isn't it?
441942 443610 I love Victoriana.
443652 446780 - Being here is like being<br />a princess in a fairy tale.
446822 449533 - Do you have fairy<br />princess fantasies, Elaine?
449575 450575 - Of course.
451034 452703 We may be grown women, but<br />underneath
452744 456874 we're just little girls<br />dreaming about being carried off
456915 459293 by a prince on a white horse.
459960 461587 - Yes, I suppose so.
461628 463755 It's ridiculous, isn't it?
469970 473474 - I don't think I've found<br />my Prince Charming yet,
473515 475767 but I think I found the formula.
475809 477245 You know, I've been<br />studying parapsychology
477269 481398 and I understand men so<br />much better than I used to.
483817 487946 If only I would have known<br />before what I know now.
490282 493076 Then Jerry would have never left<br />me.
493118 494244 - Who's Jerry?
494745 496038 - My ex-husband.
497664 501168 The day he left me was<br />the day that I died.
503629 506340 But then I was reborn as a<br />witch.
508759 511220 Barbara and Gahan brought me<br />back to life.
511261 515390 They taught me everything I<br />know about magic and about men.
516725 518477 Men are like children.
518936 521104 They're very easy to please
521438 524816 as long as we give them what<br />they want.
524858 525817 ♫ Tra la la la
525859 529154 ♫ Tra la la la la di da
532199 536328 ♫ I dreamed of a fairy<br />lady in a strange land
539915 544044 ♫ She captured the hearts<br />of all the boys and men
548757 551552 ♫ She wore a gown

564231 565274 - Where were we?
565315 569528 Oh, men, you said we need<br />to give them what they want.
569570 571446 Well, what do men want?
572114 575951 - Just a pretty woman to<br />love and to take care of them
575993 578745 and to make them feel like a man
578787 579931 and to give them total freedom
579955 582583 in whatever they wanna do or be.
583083 585294 - But what about what we want?
585335 586920 How are we going to be equals<br />with men
586962 590465 if we keep catering to all of<br />their needs?
590507 594845 - I think that if you want<br />love, you have to give love.
594886 599016 Giving men sex is a way of<br />unlocking their love potential.
599766 603645 - You sound as if you'd been<br />brainwashed by the patriarchy.
603687 607816 Your whole self-worth is<br />wrapped up in pleasing a man.
608108 610986 I'll admit, I used sex to get<br />this,
612487 614573 but I'm not proud of it.
614615 617618 A whole world doesn't<br />revolve around a man's needs.
617659 619870 If I gave Richard sex<br />every time he wanted it,
619911 621121 I'd be a wreck.
621496 622706 - Poor Richard.
623665 627794 He loves you and he wants<br />you and you torture him.
629630 632215 You have to give a man his<br />fantasy.
632257 635052 - His fantasy?
635093 636637 - Yes, his fantasy.
639139 641975 But what I'm really interested<br />in
642017 643017 is love.
645354 648231 You might say I'm addicted to<br />love.
649441 652527 I wonder if all women feel that<br />way?
652569 656073 - Well, it depends on<br />what you mean by love.
656114 657949 A husband isn't a prince,<br />Elaine,
657991 660327 and life isn't a fairy tale.
660369 662371 We have to face that fact.
662412 663412 - Why?
664039 665224 Maybe life could be a fairy tale
665248 667334 if you pleased your husband<br />more.
667376 670087 - I don't<br />need to please Richard.
670128 672214 Richard loves me for myself.
672255 673255 - Of course.
673882 676426 Perhaps you did find your Prince<br />Charming.
676468 677761 - Perhaps I did.
691024 692024 - Guess who.
692567 695612 - Richard, what are you doing<br />here?
696488 698115 This tea room is for ladies<br />only.
698156 700409 - Oh, I went to visit you at<br />work
700450 701660 and Julie said you were here.
701702 704246 I thought we could have lunch<br />together.
704287 707457 - Well, that's very sweet,<br />but I've already had my lunch.
707499 709376 Oh, uh, Richard, this is Elaine.
709418 712337 Elaine, this is my husband,<br />Richard.
712921 715173 - I've heard so much about you,<br />Richard.
715215 717801 - Nothing too horrible, I hope.
717843 719094 - On the contrary.
857399 858859 - Goddess, please,
861611 864072 send me a beautiful, sweet man
866032 868076 to love me as I love him.
873832 875458 To love me, love me,
880630 881630 love me,
883466 884466 love me,
886136 887136 love me,
888305 889305 love me,
890515 891515 love me,
892976 893976 love me.
914331 915790 Hi, are you Wendy?
916291 918710 - Yes, what can I do for you?
918752 919794 - I'm Elaine.
920128 921796 We spoke on the phone.
921838 924633 I make natural soaps<br />and candles and things.
924674 926051 - Elaine, right.
926092 927802 Thanks for coming by.
928261 929512 Mind if I have a look?
929554 930554 - Please do.
938063 939439 - These are nice.
943443 944443 Really nice.
946321 949199 I think these will do well in<br />the store.
949240 950784 - Then you'll take them?
950825 954537 - Let's start with these<br />and see how they do.
958041 961002 If these sell in the next<br />week or two, I'll order more.
961044 962044 Sound good?
962295 963672 - Yes, fantastic.
964089 965465 Thank you, Wendy.
965507 966716 - Sure, Elaine.
967008 968385 Bright blessings.
1008216 1010885 - People always<br />ask me why I'm a witch.
1010927 1015015 I tell them it's because I<br />want to have magical powers.
1015056 1017100 But it's not like it sounds.
1017142 1021271 All it is is using your<br />will to get what you want.
1056973 1057973 - Hi.
1058975 1059975 - Hi.
1061686 1064647 - It's a beautiful day.
1064689 1065732 - Yes, it is.
1067150 1069527 I love to be out in<br />nature on days like this.
1069569 1071362 - Oh, you like nature?
1071780 1072780 - Very much.
1073782 1076409 You seem like a nature type too.
1077077 1080330 I'll bet you like to<br />spend time in the woods.
1080371 1081664 - That's right.
1081706 1083124 How'd you know?
1083166 1084667 - I can just tell.
1084709 1087378 Nature is where your heart is.
1087420 1091382 City and people can get<br />to be too much for you.
1091424 1095553 - Whuh, that is a lot to get<br />from someone in a few seconds.
1097388 1099349 - I'm talented that way.
1100350 1103311 - Well, you're right about the<br />city.
1103770 1106189 In fact, I have a house out in<br />the woods
1106231 1108191 about an hour from here.
1108650 1111778 I like to go there whenever<br />I can to, you know,
1111820 1113404 just think and read.
1115490 1117158 - Do you take your wife up<br />there?
1117200 1119911 - No.
1120286 1121579 I'm not married.
1123164 1124475 - Well, you might at<br />least take a girl up there
1124499 1125834 once in a while.
1125875 1128586 - I do.
1128628 1130421 I do, once in a while.
1131631 1133424 - You wanna take a girl up there<br />now?
1137720 1139097 What do you mean?
1140807 1142559 - Well, I'm new in town
1142600 1146146 and I haven't seen much<br />of the nature around here.
1146187 1148481 I'll make you a nice dinner.
1149065 1153194 - Yes, okay, sure.
1153528 1156072 Uh, my car is right over there.
1157157 1158157 - Okay.
1159450 1160450 Let's go.
1208249 1211461 You know what I'd like to do<br />right now?
1217675 1219636 I'd like to make love<br />right here in the car
1219677 1221554 just like we were kids.
1224057 1225850 - Wait, wait.
1230146 1231272 You want some?
1233233 1234275 - What is it?
1235026 1236569 - Something I made.
1243952 1244952 - Mm.
1245578 1249207 Oh, wo, ho, ho, ho,<br />that is, that is strong.
1250750 1251750 - Finish it.
1262470 1264931 - Oh.
1270061 1272105 - No, Wayne, Wayne, stop.
1274065 1275065 Not here.
1275525 1276818 Let's go inside.
1289664 1291124 This is beautiful.
1296337 1298131 I'll start the dinner.
1340715 1341715 - Wow.
1348723 1350433 This looks delicious.
1353436 1354436 - To nature.
1373498 1376084 - This is really nice, isn't it?
1376959 1378628 I like to come up here a lot
1378669 1381255 at the end of the semester to<br />unwind.
1381297 1382632 - Are you a teacher?
1382673 1385343 - Yeah, I teach at the<br />university.
1385385 1387345 - Oh, what do you teach?
1388262 1390014 - English and French literature
1390056 1392767 with a focus on the 18th<br />century.
1393518 1395937 - So, you must be quite a<br />libertine.
1395978 1397105 - A libertine?
1398272 1399899 Why would you say that?
1399941 1401275 - Oh, you know.
1401317 1404821 All of the dangerous<br />liaisons, Fanny Hill stuff.
1404862 1406197 Not to mention Casanova.
1406239 1409826 - Well, there<br />were a lot of books written
1409867 1411494 in the 18th century.
1411536 1413079 - Well, is it true?
1413579 1415206 Are you a libertine?
1416499 1417499 - Yes I am.
1418501 1419544 I love women.
1420336 1422046 Does that bother you?
1422088 1423548 - On the contrary.
1428469 1429469 Oh, hmm,
1431722 1433516 I feel strange, dizzy.
1439313 1442024 What was in that drink you gave<br />me?
1442066 1445945 - Organic berries, vodka,<br />hallucinogenic herbs.
1447488 1449365 - Hallucinogenic herbs?
1451742 1452742 Oh, baby.
1453202 1454829 You are really wild.
1460376 1464380 - Would you mind if I made<br />myself more comfortable?
1464422 1465465 - Not at all.

1749623 1753753 No woman has ever given<br />herself like that to me before.
1754378 1756589 - Life has been tough, huh?
1756964 1758340 - Yeah, in a way.
1763262 1766682 You're not like any other woman<br />I've met.
1766724 1768434 No games, no agendas.
1770811 1773773 You just seem to take life as it<br />is.
1775566 1778235 - Is there any other way to take<br />life?
1778277 1780988 - Well, the women I've been<br />with,
1782406 1784426 they all want you to make<br />a bunch of promises to 'em
1784450 1786911 as soon as you sleep with 'em.
1787787 1790956 But, how can you commit to someone<br />that you don't even know?
1790998 1791998 It's crazy.
1792750 1793959 - I know, baby.
1795252 1796252 I know.
1797963 1802092 - I never thought I wanted<br />to be tied down to anybody.
1802551 1806597 But it's just 'cause no<br />one was ever quite right.
1807181 1810976 All the women that I'm<br />attracted to physically
1811268 1813562 they're never bright enough.
1813938 1818192 And all the bright ones are<br />homely and don't arouse me.
1818234 1821028 - That seems like quite a<br />problem.
1821862 1824657 - It is.
1825449 1828077 I feel my whole life as a loner,
1828494 1831038 thinkin' I didn't need anybody.
1833040 1835000 But now I'm not so sure.
1835960 1836960 Oh, Elaine,
1838712 1842383 I have never felt real<br />love like this before.
1842967 1847221 - You're just having a<br />lot of emotions right now.
1847263 1849807 - Oh.
1850349 1851892 Elaine, I'm scared.
1854979 1858524 I'm not used to feeling<br />things so strongly.
1859066 1861110 I can't take it, I can't take<br />it.
1861151 1863654 Oh.
1865406 1869535 Elaine, I'm<br />sick.
1870286 1871286 I'm sick.
1872913 1874707 - Hey, it's all right.
1877334 1878377 I've got you.
1879128 1880128 I love you.
1881714 1884341 And I'll always be here for you.
1886510 1888304 Try to get some sleep.
1897771 1899481 - Elaine.
1903152 1904945 Elaine, where are you?
1906655 1908449 Elaine, where are you?
1913203 1914747 - What a pussy.
1915623 1916623 What a baby.
1916957 1918959 I thought I'd found a real man,
1919001 1920920 but he's just like a little<br />girl.
1920961 1922671 - Elaine!
1923547 1924983 - No one was ever<br />there for me
1925007 1927176 when I was crying my heart out.
1928719 1930763 No one ever comforted me.
1931430 1932430 No one.
2006547 2008340 - Good morning, Wayne.
2009258 2010300 - Hi, Elaine.
2016890 2018434 - Here, drink this.
2029111 2032406 - I had such horrible dreams<br />last night.
2032740 2035451 - What did you dream about,<br />baby.
2035868 2038120 - I dreamt that I was calling<br />your name
2038162 2040039 and you didn't answer.
2040080 2044209 I kept calling and calling,<br />but I couldn't find you.
2047379 2050257 Oh, Elaine, you love me, don't<br />you?
2052634 2053886 - Of course, I love you.
2053927 2058057 - Oh God, oh God,<br />Elaine.
2063520 2064897 - Are you hungry?
2066940 2068984 - I don't know what I am.
2069359 2071820 - Well, try to get some sleep.
2073072 2074072 - Elaine.
2075949 2077326 Don't leave me.
2077367 2079578 - I'm not going anywhere, baby.
2079620 2081163 I'll be right here.
2108357 2109566 Wayne, wake up.
2110109 2111109 It's late.
2113612 2114612 Wayne.
2115697 2117366 Wayne, baby, wake up.
2119118 2120118 Wake up.
2121370 2122370 Wayne.
2198030 2200574 - Tampons aren't gross.
2200616 2203994 Women bleed and that's a<br />beautiful thing.
2205078 2209208 Do you know that most men have<br />never even seen a used tampon?
2215631 2218342 Part of me can be with Wayne<br />now.
2220093 2221093 Always.
2223931 2226141 I don't really mind death.
2226183 2228310 I've buried people before.
2230020 2231313 People I really cared about.
2236735 2240113 In the end we're all just<br />compost anyway.
2241740 2243617 Everything regenerates.
2247162 2249706 I'd like to come back as a cat.
2250707 2254086 I've been so depressed since my<br />cat died.
2254378 2258507 His name was Greymalkin,<br />but he was black and white.
2259800 2261593 He was my best friend.
2280696 2282990 - I give the rainbow to you.
2286034 2287034 Right now.
2387552 2388678 Just a minute.
2396395 2397395 Oh hi Trish.
2397938 2398938 Come on in.
2399106 2400232 - Hey, Elaine.
2400649 2401817 You look gorgeous.
2401858 2403527 I love what you've done with<br />your hair.
2403568 2404568 - Thank you.
2405487 2406696 What's up, honey?
2406738 2408049 - Well, I haven't been able to<br />reach you,
2408073 2409032 so I thought I'd come over
2409074 2411159 to see if everything was all<br />right.
2411201 2412201 - I'm fine.
2412702 2413702 Really.
2414996 2416748 Can I offer you something?
2416790 2419334 I just made some tea and cake.
2419376 2421169 - Just tea, thank you.
2433849 2435308 - Cream and sugar?
2435350 2437477 - No, I'm fine, thank you.
2453326 2456121 So, what have you been so busy<br />with?
2456163 2457289 A man, I hope.
2457706 2459332 - Yes, it was a man.
2460750 2462711 But, it didn't work out.
2463170 2464254 - I'm Sorry.
2464296 2467841 - Yes, it's a shame<br />and I really liked him.
2470677 2472387 I thought that he was the one.
2472429 2474389 - Well, maybe next time.
2475932 2478393 - Are you sure you won't have<br />some cake?
2478435 2480061 - Oh, no, thank you.
2480854 2484816 I just came over to check up<br />on you and to say good bye.
2484858 2485858 - Good bye?
2487194 2488862 Why, where are you going?
2488904 2492866 - Oh, just to Dallas for<br />a furniture convention.
2493283 2495452 - Is Richard going with you?
2495494 2497162 - No, it's just a business trip.
2497204 2501249 Richard will have to fend<br />for himself for awhile.
2535909 2538328 - Sam, give me two whiskeys on<br />the rocks.
2538370 2539871 - Sure thing, Jane.
2541706 2543166 Did you see the papers today?
2543208 2544208 - No, why?
2545043 2547212 - They found a body in the Eel<br />River.
2547254 2548254 - A murder?
2548880 2549880 - Maybe.
2550882 2554177 They found a symbol carved in<br />his chest.
2555762 2556762 Here.
2558765 2561726 - It's a pentagram.
2561768 2563895 - It's them witches again.
2564312 2567524 - That's what I was thinking<br />too, Lyle.
2569568 2572696 - So yeah, Barbara, that's<br />everything.
2572988 2576700 After Jerry died, the cops<br />wouldn't stop harassing me.
2576741 2578868 They couldn't prove anything.
2578910 2581830 They actually thought that I<br />killed him.
2581871 2583415 Can you believe it?
2584666 2588587 Anyways, San Francisco got<br />to be a really bad trip
2588628 2589838 after you left.
2591423 2594175 That's when I remembered you<br />had that extra apartment.
2594217 2596177 - Well, it was perfect timing.
2596219 2598555 I'm just sorry I wasn't here to<br />greet you.
2598597 2599764 That's all right.
2599806 2601600 Trish has been lovely.
2602225 2604644 And I've been getting<br />a lot of artwork done.
2604686 2606980 But I had this experience last<br />weekend
2607022 2608982 that really shook me up.
2611067 2612819 - Why, what happened?
2612861 2615905 - Well, I met this great-looking<br />guy.
2615947 2618283 And I used love magic on him.
2618325 2620869 Then he got really weird on me.
2621870 2625665 All these emotions started<br />flowing out of him.
2627500 2628960 Then he got really
2630337 2631337 sick.
2632464 2634591 - Well, guys can't handle<br />their emotions too well.
2634633 2637469 That's why they don't<br />like heavy conversations.
2637510 2639679 It was probably just too much<br />for him.
2639721 2643600 All the love and the great<br />sex that you were giving him.
2643642 2646019 - I guess that's what it was.
2646645 2648104 But, I don't know.
2649105 2651399 - Honey, you have to be more<br />careful.
2651441 2652877 Maybe you shouldn't be<br />messing with love spells
2652901 2655278 in the first place, you know.
2657447 2659157 - Merry Meet, Elaine.
2660241 2662285 - Bright blessings Gahan.
2681221 2684057 - I heard you discussing love<br />spells.
2684099 2685975 You do have to be careful,<br />Elaine.
2686017 2689813 Love spells never work the<br />way you think they will.
2689854 2693358 But on a lighter note, it's<br />wonderful to see you, Elaine.
2693400 2695652 What's it been now, a year?
2695694 2699531 We must celebrate this<br />reunion of dear friends.
2699572 2701866 Thank you, Goddess, everywhere,
2703910 2706496 for the blessings that we share.
2706538 2708748 - Blessed be, Hurrahya!
2711167 2712711 - Go home, witches.
2714337 2715337 Go home.
2716715 2717716 - Just ignore them.
2717757 2719426 They're always giving us<br />trouble.
2719467 2722178 - I didn't know this town<br />was hostile to witches.
2722220 2724472 - Well, it's certainly not San<br />Francisco.
2724514 2726933 But it's not bad for a small<br />town.
2726975 2728727 Not all of them embrace our<br />methods
2728768 2730603 of practicing witchcraft.
2730645 2734441 But, I don't see why we<br />ought to be so uptight now.
2734482 2737777 Back in the day, we all made<br />love freely
2738069 2742031 and put up Baphomet posters<br />and no one was dogmatic
2742073 2745577 about whether they were a witch<br />or a Satanist or a Thelemite
2745618 2748496 or a Druid or a Wiccan or<br />whatever.
2749456 2750665 And it was fun.
2752333 2754836 But our classes and circles<br />have been very popular.
2760884 2761760 - What have you been teaching?
2761802 2765096 - Let's see, I've got a<br />new class on sigil magic
2765138 2768641 and Barbara's got a new<br />class on organite alchemy.
2768684 2770977 Otherwise, we're still<br />teaching the staples,
2771019 2773813 energy grounding,<br />Earth-based spirituality,
2773855 2775648 pagan arts and crafts,
2775691 2779819 candle work, the spellcraft<br />master class, ancient mysticism,
2780195 2783740 herbs and spices, and<br />sex magic, of course.
2784407 2787202 - Oh, are you still teaching<br />that?
2787619 2791414 - Yes, in fact, we've invited<br />some girls here tonight
2791456 2795418 for a seminar about the<br />power of sexual dancing.
2796127 2800256 Dancing is such a powerful<br />thing for women and girls.
2800840 2802592 - Are you still dancing?
2802634 2804511 - Yeah, some of us dance<br />here on Amateur Night.
2804552 2805845 You should come.
2808348 2809349 - Hi, Barbara.
2809390 2810390 Hi, Gahan.
2810517 2811893 Sorry we're late.
2812560 2816022 - Hello lovely ladies, please<br />have a seat.
2817816 2821319 Elaine, this is Star and her<br />sister Moon.
2821361 2823363 They're our students for<br />tonight.
2823404 2825865 Girls, this is our dear friend<br />Elaine.
2825907 2826907 - Hi.
2827116 2828116 - Hi.
2829327 2830829 - I was just pointing out that<br />dancing
2830870 2833748 is a powerful thing for women<br />and girls.
2833790 2835291 We asked you to meet us here<br />tonight
2835333 2837794 so you could learn about that.
2839921 2842966 Do you see how powerful that<br />girl is?
2844092 2847178 These men would do anything for<br />her.
2847220 2851182 Wouldn't you like to have<br />that power yourselves?
2851975 2853434 Then let us begin.
2854018 2858147 All witches need to figure<br />out where their power lies.
2858189 2861192 And we feel that a woman's<br />greatest power
2861234 2863027 lies in her sexuality.
2863862 2867991 We don't view this power as<br />Satanic or anti-feminist,
2868575 2872662 but as a celebration of<br />woman as a natural creature.
2873121 2877166 An earthly body, a spiritual<br />essence, and a womb.
2879752 2882213 - The whole history of<br />witchcraft is interwoven
2882255 2885049 with the fear of female<br />sexuality.
2885508 2888261 They burned us at the<br />stake because they feared
2888303 2891556 the erotic feelings we elicited<br />in them.
2891598 2894893 Later, they used marriage<br />to hold us in bondage
2894934 2899063 and made us into servants,<br />whores, and fantasy dolls
2899522 2902066 never asking us what we wanted.
2902609 2905570 - They teach us that a<br />normative human being
2905612 2908406 is a hyper-rationalist, stoic<br />male
2908698 2912368 and that women's emotions<br />and intuitions are illnesses
2912410 2914203 that need to be cured.
2915246 2918833 And we believe that men<br />and women are different
2918875 2922921 and that true equality<br />lies in that difference.
2922962 2925924 - We strive for male/female<br />polarity and to regain
2925965 2927717 our primal power as goddesses.
2929385 2931596 We need to teach men how to love<br />us
2931638 2934390 using ways they can understand.
2934432 2936517 So goddesses, use perfume,
2937560 2939771 wear high heels and makeup,
2940772 2944067 learn to dress your<br />hair in attractive ways,
2944108 2948154 display flesh artfully,<br />and know what to conceal.
2949155 2951115 Be a mother and a lover.
2952283 2956412 Stand your ground, but always<br />let the man feel like a man.
2959374 2962502 - Use sex magic to destroy his<br />fear of you
2962543 2966089 and to open his heart to<br />the floodgates of love.
2966130 2969801 Only then will he begin to<br />see you as a human being
2969842 2972345 with all of your inner beauty.
2972387 2974764 Then, when his heart is open to<br />love,
2974806 2977767 you may do with him what you<br />will.
2998705 3001416 - I love you, Elaine.
3001749 3003793 You know that, don't you?
3006170 3007880 I love you very much.
3011175 3013803 But you need to be more careful.
3016389 3019517 Dinner was late three times this<br />week.
3020059 3022770 And that house is a total<br />pigsty.
3023813 3027025 Do you know that I found an old<br />hot dog
3027525 3029318 under the bed this morning?
3031946 3034907 And why don't you ever brush<br />your hair?
3034949 3039078 You need to take better care<br />of yourself and of the house.
3040246 3043207 I'm embarrassed to have people<br />over.
3043708 3045877 I've been really patient up<br />until now,
3045918 3048713 but you need to step up your<br />game.
3051215 3054135 - I have a<br />crazy bitch for a daughter.
3054177 3056888 What?
3057972 3059557 You're not crazy?
3059599 3062602 Well, if you're not<br />crazy then you're stupid.
3062643 3063436 Which is it?
3063478 3065980 Are you crazy or are you stupid?
3066022 3068232 And you could lose a few pounds.
3068274 3070735 You're looking a little fatty.
3073738 3077867 - Oh my God, Elaine,<br />you've lost so much weight.
3078159 3080536 You have such a hot body now.
3081662 3084832 Do you like it when I touch you<br />like this?
3084874 3085917 Or like this?
3089128 3090922 I wanna make you come.
3095259 3097428 - Don't be frightened, Elaine.
3097470 3099347 I would never hurt you.
3099806 3101933 I'm not the big, bad wolf.
3103059 3106604 You need to have perfect<br />love and perfect trust.
3145017 3147812 - Hast thou the courage to make<br />the essay?
3147854 3151983 - I have two words, perfect<br />love and perfect trust.
3170751 3173880 - Assist me to erect the ancient<br />altar
3174255 3177216 at which in days past all<br />worshiped.
3179218 3182680 For in the old times, a woman<br />was the altar.
3183890 3187143 And the sacred place was<br />the point within the center
3187185 3190479 of the circle, the origin of all<br />things.
3193941 3196402 Therefore, should we adore it.
3227016 3229143 - Good morning, Sergeant Griff.
3229185 3231270 Congratulations on your<br />promotion.
3231312 3232688 - Thanks, Connie.
3233356 3234982 Is there any coffee.
3235274 3236651 - Yeah, I just made some.
3236692 3239570 I made it just the way you like<br />it.
3240321 3242823 - Is there anything you don't do<br />well?
3242865 3246577 - Why don't you try me<br />sometime and find out?
3251874 3253626 - How's the coffee, Steve?
3253668 3255044 - Uh, too strong.
3257880 3259924 - Well, I like it strong.
3260508 3263761 Man's gotta stay awake<br />on the job after all.
3263803 3267181 - Why, have you been keeping<br />late nights?
3267223 3268223 - Maybe so.
3272270 3274063 - But, now that you've been<br />promoted,
3274105 3277108 maybe you ought to start<br />thinking about settling down.
3277149 3278609 - Me, you kidding?
3285074 3288786 - Sergeant Meadows, a<br />lady's here to see you.
3289078 3290538 - I'm Shelly Curtis.
3290579 3294709 I phoned about Wayne Peters,<br />the teacher who disappeared.
3295084 3296460 - Yes, of course.
3296961 3299005 Have a seat, Miss Curtis.
3301090 3304677 You say you think Mr. Peters<br />might have been kidnapped?
3304719 3308055 - Yes, no one's seen him for two<br />weeks.
3308097 3311851 I went by his house and<br />the mail's piled up.
3311892 3314854 We had lunch the day he<br />disappeared.
3315438 3319317 I saw him drive away with a<br />strange woman near the plaza.
3319358 3322320 - Do you have any idea where<br />he might have gone with her?
3322361 3323738 - Wayne used to spend weekends
3323779 3326574 up in a cabin he had in the<br />woods.
3328367 3330202 He used to take dates there.
3361859 3365071 - Oh, Jesus.

3412201 3413619 We're going to have to dig,<br />Steve.

3417498 3420793 ♫ La ♫
3421293 3423173 I think you should go<br />back to the house, Shelly.
3431929 3435433 ♫ La ♫
3449572 3450572 - Mmm, mmm,
3455494 3458289 this cake is absolutely<br />fantastic.
3458747 3460332 And what a great dinner.
3460374 3461374 - Thank you.
3462042 3463335 I enjoy cooking.
3464795 3467465 Hope you don't mind my calling<br />you.
3467506 3470468 Sometimes it's so hard to be<br />alone.
3470509 3471552 - Not at all.
3473095 3477224 I get a little lonely, too,<br />when Trish is out of town.
3484398 3486400 - How long have you<br />and Trish been married?
3486442 3488611 - 10 years this September.
3488652 3489652 - 10 years!
3491530 3493157 It's really amazing.
3495201 3499330 No one has ever loved me the<br />way you love Trish, no one.
3506587 3508714 - What about your husband?
3509131 3511342 - My husband never loved me.
3511383 3514428 He couldn't wait to get away<br />from me.
3515262 3516262 - I'm sorry.
3525856 3529985 Sometimes I think Trish would<br />like to get away from me, too.
3530861 3531861 - Poor baby.
3533322 3534615 Poor, poor baby.
3565187 3567731 So, tell me, what turns you on?
3569567 3573445 - What turns me on?
3573988 3576949 Wow, no one's ever asked me that<br />before.
3576991 3578033 Let me think.
3580411 3583122 You know what really turns me<br />on?
3583414 3584414 Flying.
3585124 3586124 - Flying?
3586417 3588294 - Yeah, flying a plane.
3588919 3591255 You don't know what kinda high<br />it is.
3591297 3594216 You're soarin' up there above<br />everything.
3594258 3595926 You're in control.
3595968 3597595 - Oh, how fantastic.
3598971 3600180 - It really is.
3601098 3605394 It's the only time I feel<br />really clear about things.
3605436 3609565 Sometimes I look at my life<br />and I wonder how I got here.
3614236 3615821 I feel like my life is slipping<br />away
3615863 3618282 and there's so many things I<br />haven't done.
3618324 3619324 - Like what?
3619575 3621160 - I've never had any sordid love<br />affairs
3621201 3623495 or gotten into any mischief.
3625122 3627166 I used to watch those<br />old Steve McQueen movies,
3627207 3630419 you know, the ones where<br />they'd rob a bank or something,
3630461 3632061 and I'd fantasize that I was one<br />of those
3632087 3636216 crazy kinda gangsters with a<br />sexy, messed up girl on my arm.
3637635 3641430 Or those Westerns, when<br />they'd shoot up a town
3641722 3644975 and then go visit the local<br />prostitutes.
3645017 3647019 It's sounds stupid, I know.
3647061 3648395 - No, it doesn't.
3650606 3651899 It's very sweet.
3653942 3654942 - Really?
3656945 3658822 Trish doesn't think so.
3659365 3662701 She just rolls her eyes<br />when I talk like this.
3662743 3666372 - That's because she<br />doesn't understand you.
3666705 3668916 I understand you perfectly.
3671001 3672001 - You do?
3672169 3673169 - Of course.
3675005 3677966 You wanna have a sordid love<br />affair.
3678884 3681595 You wanna get into some<br />mischief.
3737192 3738192 - Uh.
3756003 3757003 - Ho!
3784490 3785490 Who are you?
3786408 3788452 What are you doing to me?
3788994 3790704 - I'm the love witch.
3792122 3795667 I'm your ultimate fantasy.
3795709 3797127 - That's right.
3799338 3800338 That's right.
3807387 3809515 - Steve, I'm going out<br />to see that witch doctor.
3809556 3810556 - Who?
3810724 3812017 - Professor King.
3812059 3814770 He specializes in black<br />magic and witchcraft.
3814812 3815604 He might be able to help me
3815646 3817439 identify some of the items we<br />found.
3817481 3818690 - It's great.
3818732 3820400 Did you get the lab report?
3820442 3824071 - Yeah, yeah, it looks like<br />heart failure.
3824112 3827324 But the toxicology report<br />showed traces of Jimson weed
3827366 3831495 also known as Devil's weed, a<br />highly toxic hallucinogenic.
3832120 3833747 - It's unbelievable.
3834122 3835707 You want me to come with you?
3835749 3838418 - No, this will only take a few<br />minutes.
3838460 3841046 Can you order me a turkey<br />and avocado on whole wheat?
3841088 3842381 - Mustard, mayo?
3842965 3844675 - Yeah and cole slaw.
3845300 3846093 Thanks.
3846134 3847134 - Done.
3855894 3859231 - Ah, Sergeant Meadows, sorry<br />to have kept you waiting.
3859273 3861733 - Glad to meet you, Professor.
3864695 3867447 Professor, this is the<br />bottle we found in a grave
3867489 3871618 of Wayne Peters, the one<br />you read about in the paper.
3871660 3873203 - Interesting, yes.
3874121 3876582 Just as I thought.
3876623 3879501 The contents indicate<br />that it's a witch bottle.
3879543 3880711 - A witch bottle?
3880752 3881896 - Yes, witches used to make them
3881920 3884548 for protection against curses.
3884590 3888051 They'd take something personal<br />like bodily fluids or hair
3888093 3889928 along with herbs and something<br />sharp
3889970 3894141 like pins or broken glass<br />to scare away evil spirits.
3894182 3896202 Witch bottles have often been<br />found buried in the hearths
3896226 3897853 of very old houses.
3897895 3900564 - Would it be safe to assume<br />that the person who made this
3900606 3901606 was a witch?
3902107 3903609 - It's very likely.
3903650 3905903 Witchcraft, long dormant<br />in civilized places,
3905944 3908322 has taken root again in cities.
3908363 3910324 There have several rituals per<br />year.
3910365 3914578 One of them, Samhain,<br />corresponds of our Halloween.
3914620 3918415 Other rituals celebrate<br />Summer Solstice, Litha,
3918457 3922252 or the Winter Solstice,<br />which they call Imbolg.
3925589 3928300 Here the members of a coven<br />kiss the devil's behind
3928342 3931136 in a mockery of Christian<br />rituals.
3933013 3936308 Here, a satanic cult sacrifices<br />a child.
3937684 3939186 - Does this stuff really go on<br />today?
3939227 3940354 - Yes, indeed.
3941104 3944274 Those who practice human<br />sacrifice are the black witches
3944316 3947277 who perform blood rituals<br />to gain demonic powers
3947319 3950656 and to bind their members<br />together in secrecy.
3950697 3952991 Law has been trying to root<br />out these cults for decades
3953033 3955118 but they've been unsuccessful.
3955160 3957287 Then there are the<br />white witches or Wiccans
3957329 3959748 who commune in nature<br />in the healing spirit
3959790 3962918 and who have a strict law<br />that forbids harming others.
3962960 3965128 Every city and rural<br />village today has pockets
3965170 3966630 of both black and white witches
3966672 3969216 who practice the ancient rites.
4000205 4004334 - I invoke and call upon<br />thee, Mighty Mother of us all.
4006044 4010173 I invoke thee to descend upon<br />the body of this thy servant
4011717 4012843 and priestess.
4014970 4017389 - Of the Mother Darksome and<br />Divine
4017431 4019975 here I charge you in this sign.
4022811 4026148 - Listen to the words of the<br />Great Mother.
4028400 4031820 She, who of old, who<br />was also called Artemis,
4031862 4034573 Aphrodite, Cerridwen, Diana,<br />Isis,
4037534 4039494 and by many other names.
4043165 4045542 - Whenever ye have need of<br />anything,
4045584 4049713 then ye shall assemble in some<br />secret place and adore me,
4050714 4053008 who am Queen of all witches.
4053884 4057721 There shall ye assemble,<br />ye who are fain to learn
4057763 4058763 all sorcery.
4060140 4064394 Behold all acts of love and<br />pleasure are my rituals.
4064436 4068315 Behold I have been with<br />thee from the beginning
4068356 4072486 and I am that which is<br />attained at the end of desire.
4076198 4080243 Bagabi lacha bachabe.

4085999 4089961 Hurrahya! Hurrahya!
4095217 4096217 - Arise.

4107145 4109106 Eko, Eko, Cernunnos
4109147 4111775 Eko, Eko, Aradia!
4138009 4139809 - You're looking a little<br />tense tonight, love.
4139845 4141304 What's the matter?
4142556 4146685 - Oh nothing, just my usual<br />roller coaster love life.
4147018 4149104 - Well, have a drink and relax.
4149146 4152607 Nothing's that dire, at least<br />not for you.
4152899 4156987 It's an entirely different<br />story for your victims.
4158613 4159865 - What victims?
4159906 4163618 - There's no need to play<br />Miss Innocent with me, dearie.
4163660 4165662 - Please, don't touch me.
4171668 4173003 - Bright blessings, Barbara.
4173044 4174421 - Merry meet, Elaine.
4174462 4175630 How's it going?
4176131 4177632 - I'm back in the dating pool<br />again.
4177674 4178967 - What happened?
4179801 4181988 I thought you were crazy about<br />that new guy you were seeing,
4182012 4183305 the married man.
4183680 4185390 - No, I broke it off.
4185807 4189102 He just became really obsessive,<br />morose,
4190145 4192856 and his aura became really<br />murky.
4193815 4197027 He didn't even wanna make love<br />anymore.
4197068 4201198 He became just like a woman,<br />crying at every little thing.
4201781 4203575 There was no polarity.
4204242 4206119 But, I should have known.
4206161 4207287 He's a Pisces.
4238735 4239735 - Richard?
4243031 4244133 - I thought I told you<br />never to interrupt me
4244157 4245533 when I'm working.
4246409 4247786 What do you want?
4248995 4251015 - I just wanted to let you<br />know that I'm going to bed
4251039 4252791 and I'm taking a pill.
4271393 4273186 Are you coming to bed?
4273478 4274478 - No.
4280402 4282696 I have some more work to do.
4285782 4288743 - All right, see you tomorrow,<br />then.

4383254 4385840 - Sergeant Griff Meadows<br />of the Police Department.
4385882 4387884 I'd like to ask you a few<br />questions.
4387926 4388926 - Okay.
4398895 4401606 - Does this look familiar to<br />you?
4404734 4406486 - It's a witch bottle.
4407695 4409781 - Do you have any idea<br />who could have made it?
4409823 4411199 - No, no I don't.
4414911 4417330 - Ever seen any of these in here<br />before?
4417372 4419457 - Yeah, we have some witch<br />bottles.
4419499 4420959 I'll show you one.
4428174 4429174 Here's one.
4432971 4434764 - How common are these bottles?
4434806 4436158 - I've never seen 'em in here<br />before until
4436182 4439060 a girl started supplying 'em to<br />us.
4440353 4441896 - Who is this girl?
4443273 4446151 - Her name is Elaine, Elaine<br />Parks.
4473344 4474344 - Who is it?
4476014 4479142 - Sergeant Meadows, Police<br />Department.
4484355 4486542 Sorry to bother you, ma'am,<br />but I'm investigating a case
4486566 4489611 and I just wanted to<br />ask you a few questions.
4489652 4490695 - About what?
4491446 4493907 - Well, it's a potential<br />homicide case.
4493948 4495658 Just a routine check.
4495950 4499162 I thought you might be able to<br />help us.
4499621 4500621 - Of course.
4502707 4504751 Please come in, Sergeant.
4511799 4514427 So you say there was a homicide.
4514844 4515887 How horrible.
4517138 4518515 Who was killed?
4518556 4520767 - A man named Wayne Peters.
4521434 4523061 Did you know Wayne Peters?
4523102 4524102 - No.
4526773 4528775 - Here's a picture of him.
4528816 4530318 Ever seen him before?
4530360 4531360 - No.
4532028 4533947 I guess I can't help you,<br />Sergeant.
4533988 4534822 Good bye.
4534864 4536324 - Ms. Parks, wait.
4543164 4546876 Have you ever seen<br />anything like this before?
4547252 4549087 - It's a Magic Bottle.
4549128 4550505 I made it myself.
4551631 4554634 - Have you ever seen one<br />containing urine?
4554676 4555676 - Urine?
4556886 4557886 No.
4568523 4572652 - We found this bottle containing<br />urine and a used tampon
4573903 4576281 on the grave of Wayne Peters.
4578616 4582245 - Will you excuse me<br />for a moment, Sergeant?
4587750 4590128 - Ms. Parks, are you a witch?
4590503 4591503 - Yes, I am.
4592171 4594173 Is there a law against that?
4594215 4598011 - I guess not, not unless<br />you do something wrong.
4598052 4600305 - Do you think that being<br />a witch makes me evil,
4600346 4602223 capable of murder even?
4603016 4605810 - No, I wasn't trying to<br />imply...
4605852 4609022 - Sergeant Meadows, do<br />you know what it's like
4609063 4610440 to really suffer?
4612025 4613443 You have to fight and fight
4613484 4616571 until you're too exhausted to go<br />on.
4616613 4619574 Witchcraft is my religion,<br />Sergeant.
4620116 4624370 And this religion, which is<br />older than your Christianity,
4624412 4625538 saved my life.
4640261 4643890 - Ms. Parks, I'm sorry<br />if I've offended you.
4646267 4647644 I didn't realize.
4651230 4654192 - That's all right, Sergeant<br />Meadows.
4659656 4661616 - You can call me Griff.
4662950 4663950 - Griff?
4667121 4669415 I know I've seen you before.
4671167 4673127 I just don't know where.
4674253 4676464 - I have that same feeling.
4677173 4678173 - I know.
4682428 4684722 You're the man in the cards.
4686099 4687308 You're my fate.
4688643 4691437 - What do you mean, I'm your<br />fate?
4691771 4694524 - I did a Celtic Cross reading.
4694565 4697944 For my future card I got Knight<br />of Wands.
4700113 4704283 Always felt that if that card<br />showed up in a future reading,
4704325 4707829 I would soon meet the man<br />that I'm going to marry.
4707870 4711666 But, the man that I marry<br />has to love animals.
4711708 4713918 Do you like animals, Griff?
4714460 4716546 - Why yes, I love animals.
4717463 4719507 In fact, a friend of<br />mine has a couple horses
4719549 4721134 I'm very fond of.
4721175 4723803 You know, tomorrow is my day off
4724429 4727473 and it's supposed to be quite<br />nice out.
4727515 4731519 Maybe I'll get away from<br />the city and do some riding.
4731561 4733855 Do you like to ride, Elaine?
4762425 4763425 Whoa.
4788451 4791829 - Oh Patchouli, you're such a<br />sweetheart.
4802507 4803800 - How's my girl?
4804675 4806010 - Am I your girl?
4806594 4808221 - For today you are.
4809514 4810949 You're my girl and there's<br />nobody around
4810973 4812683 to tell me otherwise.
4814602 4815602 - Except me.
4816938 4818523 - And what's that supposed to<br />mean?
4818564 4821776 - Nothing.
4822443 4824570 Kiss me.
4835248 4836833 - What's that sound?
4837375 4838584 - I don't know.
4839210 4840210 Let's go see.
4923461 4926964 - Now is the time of the Summer<br />Solstice.
4927006 4930092 The strength of the Oak King is<br />waning.
4930134 4933262 And the Holly King stands<br />ready to challenge him
4933304 4936015 for the hand of the Green<br />Maiden.
4937975 4939852 - Let the battle begin.
4945441 4946859 - Your season is over old man.
4947735 4948735 - Oh never.
4955910 4957244 - I will have her.
4957286 4958347 - Never have her.
4959205 4960205 - Never.
4964460 4966963 - Holly King, I name you the<br />victor.
4967004 4969006 The Green Maiden is yours.
4969048 4970048 - M'lady.
4971592 4972592 Come on.
4979016 4980016 - Elaine.
4980977 4982353 - You know these people?
4982395 4984146 - Well yes, in a way.
4984188 4986399 - All hail, fair Lord and Lady.
4986440 4988401 Welcome to our little gathering.
4988442 4989442 - All hail.
4990611 4992214 - We are the good people<br />of the Renaissance
4992238 4996367 and Medieval players and we<br />are celebrating the Midsummer.
4996409 4997868 Won't you join us?
4998244 5000454 - To be sure, fair consorts.
5008087 5009839 - They are charming, are they<br />not?
5009880 5011674 - Yes, quite charming.
5012258 5014635 - I see two people in love.
5014677 5016887 This calls for a wedding.
5016929 5017888 - A wedding?
5017930 5020141 - Yes, a mock wedding, if you<br />will.
5020182 5022309 To honor the gods of love.

5236899 5240653 - I'm so happy for you,<br />Elaine, he's adorable.
5272685 5274353 - I'm not in love.
5274395 5276230 It's not that I don't have<br />sentiment,
5276272 5278148 it's just that love is soft.
5278190 5280234 You need guts in this business.
5280276 5282545 I've seen guys get shot to<br />death because they fell in love
5282569 5284196 and got soft inside.
5284822 5286490 I want an heir some day
5286532 5288117 and then I would need to have a<br />wife,
5288158 5290327 but love is something else.
5290369 5293163 A man can get destroyed<br />by things like that.
5293205 5295749 It's like he's not even a man<br />anymore.
5295791 5298002 I never wanna get like that.
5299169 5301797 - When you really love him,
5301839 5305509 it's like fireworks and<br />nothing else matters.
5306302 5308429 You love all the little quirks<br />about him.
5308470 5310848 The way he slurps his cereal.
5311849 5314184 The way his mouth is a little<br />crooked.
5314226 5318314 Those details about him<br />become your whole life.
5318355 5321900 Something inside you<br />opens up like a flower
5322609 5325946 and you realize that you<br />have more love to give
5325988 5328866 than you ever thought was<br />possible.
5329616 5331994 'Cause the more you know him,
5333245 5335039 the more you love him.
5336415 5338018 - The more<br />you get to know a woman,
5338042 5340627 the less you can feel about her.
5340669 5343213 At first, she's this<br />incredible object of mystery
5343255 5346550 who fulfills all you're wildest<br />fantasies.
5346592 5349595 Then she starts to reveal little<br />flaws
5349636 5353515 and after a while, just<br />gets pretty hard to care.
5353557 5357102 Feminine ideal only<br />exists in a man's mind.
5358270 5360981 No woman could ever fulfill it.
5361023 5364151 And sometimes, when she<br />tries to love you more,
5364193 5368155 give you more, you feel<br />like you're suffocating,
5369490 5371200 drowning in estrogen.
5372618 5374495 The most awful feeling.
5382795 5384963 - Dinner tonight, Griff?
5385005 5387299 - Um, can't tonight, Connie.
5389259 5390552 Some other time.
5396767 5397911 - Hey Griff, I got more<br />information
5397935 5399520 on that Elaine Parks girl.
5399561 5401814 - You leave it on my desk.
5401855 5403065 - Don't you wanna hear it?
5403107 5406485 - Steve, Captain wants<br />us to lay off the case.
5406527 5407903 - Are you serious?
5407945 5411573 - He says we have a policy<br />of leaving the witches alone.
5411615 5413992 He says they've lived<br />in this town a long time
5414034 5415828 and he doesn't like to mess with<br />them.
5415869 5417663 - Even if they murder?
5418956 5420350 - He says he's satisfied<br />that Wayne's death
5420374 5421917 was a heart attack.
5422543 5423710 I think so too.
5427506 5430008 - Has everyone gone crazy around<br />here?
5430050 5433178 Let me at least tell you what I<br />found.
5438142 5440894 Now, Elaine used to run<br />an organic beauty store
5440936 5442896 in Berkeley with her husband,<br />Jerry.
5442938 5444648 Two years later they were<br />divorced
5444690 5446233 and Elaine moved to San<br />Francisco
5446275 5448402 to start dancing at a burlesque<br />club
5448444 5451864 where she got involved with a<br />witch coven.
5459288 5461498 The coven broke up<br />after police questioning
5461540 5464168 when some of it's members<br />died mysteriously.
5464209 5468338 Soon after, Elaine's ex-husband<br />died of a drug overdose
5469131 5472718 shortly before he was planning<br />to remarry.
5472759 5474303 The police questioned Elaine
5474344 5477097 but they couldn't find enough to<br />hold her.
5477139 5479892 - Well, if the San Francisco<br />Police couldn't find anything,
5479933 5481852 what happened there is<br />none of our business.
5481894 5483562 - Are you serious?
5483604 5486023 - I'd say this woman is<br />a dangerous character
5486064 5488108 and you better watch her.
5488817 5490777 - You mean because she's a<br />witch?
5490819 5492654 That doesn't mean anything.
5492696 5496700 - No, her husband died of a<br />drug he'd never taken before.
5496742 5498136 And did you ever find where<br />Wayne Peters
5498160 5499870 got the Devil's weed?
5500787 5503165 - I questioned Ms. Curtis about<br />that.
5503207 5506126 There was Devil's weed<br />growing near his cabin.
5506168 5508837 Apparently, he experimented<br />often with drugs.
5508879 5510964 - Come on Griff, can't<br />you connect the dots?
5511006 5512341 We have a possible murder here
5512382 5515010 and Elaine is our only suspect.
5515052 5517387 - I told you, we're laying off<br />her.
5517429 5520140 - Because of orders or because<br />you're in love with her?
5520182 5521558 - Who says I'm in love with her?
5521600 5522935 Get the hell off my back.
5528315 5532027 - You're out of line,<br />Griff, way out of line.
5567020 5568020 - Richard.
5570566 5571566 Richard!
5573110 5574110 Richard!
5574528 5575528 Richard!
5622743 5624786 - Thank you for meeting me,<br />Elaine.
5624828 5627706 It's not good for me to be alone<br />too much.
5627748 5629291 I know you're busy.
5629333 5630333 - Of course.
5630917 5632294 I wanted to come.
5634546 5638258 - I can't help but blaming<br />myself for what happened.
5638300 5640510 - You can't blame yourself.
5640886 5643513 You were a good wife to Richard.
5645140 5646433 - I tried to be.
5648644 5651104 I tried so hard to please him,
5652230 5654441 but I should have tried harder.
5654483 5658612 He wanted a certain type of<br />woman, someone I could never be.
5661239 5662949 Maybe you were right.
5663533 5666828 Maybe you should give a man his<br />fantasy.
5668497 5672376 I thought that was so<br />awful when you said that.
5672876 5674836 Maybe I was being naive,
5675379 5678674 but I really thought he loved me<br />for me.
5680133 5681927 But now, now I wish...
5686682 5689810 - You have to stop torturing<br />yourself.
5690143 5691687 You have to let go.
5692854 5696358 Remember how he changed<br />after my Dallas trip?
5696400 5699861 I think that's when he<br />started having that affair.
5699903 5702864 Whoever she was she drove him<br />crazy.
5704241 5706618 I hated him so much for that.
5707577 5709788 I wanted to kill them both.
5710497 5714626 If I ever found out who she<br />was, I would rip her to pieces.
5715460 5718672 But now I see I should have<br />helped him.
5719256 5723385 I didn't know that he was<br />going to take his own life.
5724928 5725928 - Hey,
5726888 5727888 hey.
5730142 5731601 - Enough about me.
5733353 5735397 What's going on with you?
5735439 5737149 - Trish, I'm in love.
5740777 5741777 - Who is he?
5742112 5745240 - He's a detective and he's<br />everything
5745532 5747451 a woman could ever want.
5748577 5751955 He's strong and handsome, smart<br />and kind.
5754624 5757085 I just know that he's the one.
5758170 5760297 He even gave me this ring.
5760589 5762549 I call it my magic ring.
5763425 5764551 It's not an engagement ring
5764593 5768722 but I just know that he's<br />gonna pop the question soon.
5784446 5785405 - When we first came here
5785447 5788909 I showed you my engagement ring,<br />remember?
5791203 5792829 I can barely stand to look at it<br />anymore.
5792871 5794247 It's too painful.
5796666 5799628 I'm sure he's going to ask you<br />soon.
5799669 5803089 You're going to make a beautiful<br />bride.
5803131 5804841 The first day we met,
5806176 5809012 you were envious of me because I<br />had a man
5809054 5810931 and you were all alone.
5811890 5813600 Now it's the reverse.
5815435 5817395 Life is funny, isn't it?
5820106 5822859 - Trish, I'm sorry, I've gotta<br />go.
5822901 5825779 Would you like to walk out with<br />me?
5826071 5829533 - No, I'd like to stay and<br />finish my tea.
5829574 5830574 - All right.
5833578 5834871 Take care, love.
5875370 5877080 - Hi Elaine, it's me.
5877706 5879583 Yeah, you left your ring here.
5879624 5883044 You're probably driving but<br />I'll drop it by on my way home.
5883086 5884713 See you in a minute.

6233311 6235021 You'll burn for this.
6245365 6247158 - Crash, crash, crash.

6307802 6310513 Even should they strive to flee
6310555 6313099 they'll cling for all eternity.
6324944 6325944 - Scotch.
6342920 6344672 - Bottle o' beer, Sam.
6351512 6353473 Who are those new girls?
6353931 6356100 They can't dance at all.
6356142 6357602 And they're weird.
6362648 6366778 - I don't know, but the<br />customers really like 'em.
6367320 6368905 - They're friends of the<br />witches.
6368946 6371157 I seen them come in together<br />before.
6371199 6372825 - Yeah, the witches.
6374285 6375828 They're everywhere.
6376829 6377997 - One gin and tonic, Sam.
6378039 6380166 - Gin and tonic coming up.
6380875 6381793 - Did you read about the teacher
6381834 6384337 buried in the back yard of his<br />cabin?
6384379 6386631 They said it was done by the<br />witches.
6386672 6388132 - Oh yeah, I read about that.
6388174 6391302 They found all kinds of<br />witchcraft things on the grave.
6391344 6393596 - Yeah, I heard about that, too.
6393638 6394638 Creepy.
6412490 6414033 - Sit down, Elaine.
6421624 6424836 Elaine, the DNA came back from<br />the lab.
6427130 6429966 It connects you with Wayne<br />Peters.
6432635 6435263 Patricia Manning came by the<br />station.
6435304 6437014 With some things of yours.
6438891 6440101 Including this.
6442311 6445773 She said you drove her husband<br />to suicide.
6449235 6451112 - So, I was a bad girl.
6451821 6454031 Are you going to punish me?
6455825 6458953 - What sort of person are you,<br />Elaine?
6458995 6462623 What sort of sick mind<br />would do such things?
6463124 6465168 - Why are you so negative?
6465209 6466919 I didn't kill anyone.
6467628 6469839 Wayne died of heart failure
6470339 6473468 after a beautiful night of<br />lovemaking.
6474051 6478014 And Richard died because<br />he loved me too much.
6478055 6480725 These men weren't used to<br />the deep feelings of love
6480766 6483102 that they were experiencing with<br />me.
6483144 6485730 - Are you saying these men died<br />of love?
6485771 6486898 That's insane.
6487607 6490776 What about the spells and the<br />drugs?
6490818 6493321 Are you saying witchcraft<br />had nothing to do with it?
6493362 6497283 - Witchcraft is just a way<br />of concentrating energy.
6497325 6500328 It can only work with<br />what's already there.
6500369 6503998 I just use sex magic to create<br />love magic.
6504040 6507627 I didn't know how strong<br />the spells would be.
6507668 6510755 Sometimes it's almost scary<br />how strong the love gets.
6510796 6511796 - Love?
6513007 6515301 What do you know about love?
6515676 6519805 What you call love is a<br />borderline personality disorder
6520723 6521723 or worse.
6522517 6524101 - Don't diagnose me.
6525019 6528397 Maybe you're a narcissist who<br />can't love.
6529607 6531234 You think that I'm sick
6531275 6534445 because you've never loved like<br />I have.
6534904 6537782 Well, I would do anything for<br />love.
6539867 6543579 - That's right, you'll<br />never get enough love.
6544664 6547750 Even when a man loves<br />you so much it kills him,
6547792 6549669 it's not enough for you.
6549710 6551754 You're like a bottomless hole.
6551796 6555925 You doll yourself up and<br />do the Stepford Wife thing
6556300 6560054 thinking every man is<br />going to fall at your feet.
6560096 6564183 But your creepy little sexy<br />act doesn't work with me.
6566852 6568229 I don't love you.
6574694 6576487 - How can you stand there and<br />boast
6576529 6578739 about being immune to love?
6579365 6583494 Why does the genuine love of<br />a woman scare you so much?
6584078 6587456 You think that your way<br />is a superior way to live?
6587498 6590418 I know a lot of women who<br />feel the way that I do.
6590459 6594088 Only men make us work<br />so hard for your love.
6595923 6599218 If you would just love us for<br />ourselves,
6601929 6603055 but you won't.
6605099 6607727 My ex-husband was just like you.
6608644 6612773 He used to punish me by<br />withholding his love from me.
6613232 6616777 All my life I've been<br />tossed in the garbage
6617778 6620906 except when men wanted to use my<br />body.
6622491 6625369 So, I decided to find my own<br />power.
6626245 6629707 And I found that power through<br />witchcraft.
6630916 6633544 That means that I take<br />what I need from men
6633586 6635963 and not the other way around.
6638883 6640509 - I'm sorry, Elaine.
6643137 6645097 It won't work this time.
6646349 6649060 I'm afraid I'm going<br />to have to arrest you.
6649101 6650101 - What for?
6651646 6654940 Marrying a lover according to my<br />religion?
6654982 6656859 Seducing a married man?
6657943 6659862 I know 400 years ago you could<br />be burned
6659904 6662948 for a thing like that, but not<br />today.
6666285 6667662 - No, not burned,
6670539 6674669 but you'll be booked for<br />burying Wayne Peters illegally
6675586 6677546 and we'll find out more.
6679006 6682802 - Oh, that's the witch<br />who killed the teacher.
6684220 6687348 - Thou shalt not suffer a witch<br />to live.
6691977 6694397 - Burn the witch.
6694480 6695606 - Burn the witch.
6695648 6697775 - Burn the witch, burn<br />the witch, burn the witch,
6697817 6704573 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6704657 6711205 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6711288 6715960 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6716043 6721257 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6721340 6727179 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6727263 6733561 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6733644 6735855 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6735896 6739150 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6739191 6742153 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch,
6742194 6746073 burn the witch, burn the<br />witch, burn the witch.
6747158 6747992 - Burn!
6748033 6748826 - Burn her.
6748868 6749660 - Burn.
6749702 6750702 Burn.
6776187 6777187 - Poor baby.
6778272 6779565 Poor, poor baby.
6785613 6788574 Don't worry, everything will be<br />okay
6790910 6793078 because I love you so much.
