54386 55819 Breakfast.
55887 57980 Wait, maybe I<br />should have had breakfast.
58056 61753 A little breck-y could be good for me.<br />No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.
63461 65691 I'm faster than fast.<br />Quicker than quick.
65764 67356 I am lightning!
68500 70799 Hey, Lightning! You ready?
72437 75600 Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready
113878 114970 Ka-chow!
162160 164151 Get your antenna balls here!
170735 172896 Go, Lightnin'!
172971 176964 - Whoo!<br />- You got that right, slick.
190488 192479 Uh!
202967 205800 Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.
205870 209499 I'm Bob Cutlass, here<br />with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.
209574 212566 <i>We're midway through what may<br />be an historic day for racing.</i>
212644 214669 <i>Bob, my oil pressure's<br />through the roof.</i>
214746 218341 <i>If this gets more exciting, they're<br />gonna have to tow me outta the booth!</i>
218416 219474 <i>Right, Darrell.</i>
219551 222179 <i>Three cars are tied<br />for the season points lead,</i>
222253 224346 <i>heading into the final race<br />of the season.</i>
224422 229189 <i>And the winner of this race will win<br />the season title and the Piston Cup.</i>
229260 230955 <i>Does The King, Strip Weathers,</i>
231029 233429 <i>have one more victory in him<br />before retirement?</i>
233498 236092 <i>He's been Dinoco's golden boy<br />for years!</i>
236167 238362 <i>Can he win them one last Piston Cup?</i>
238436 241803 <i>And, as always, in the<br />second place spot we find Chick Hicks.</i>
241873 244398 <i>He's been chasing<br />that tailfin his entire career.</i>
244476 246637 <i>Chick thought<br />this was his year.</i>
246711 249475 <i>His chance to finally emerge<br />from The King's shadow.</i>
249547 253608 <i>But the last thing he expected was...<br />Lightning McQueen!</i>
253685 256313 <i>You know, I don't think<br />anybody expected this.</i>
256387 259015 <i>The rookie sensation<br />came into the season unknown.</i>
259090 260580 <i>But everyone knows him now.</i>
260658 264719 <i>Will he be the first rookie<br />to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?</i>
264829 267389 <i>The legend, the runner-up,<br />and the rookie!</i>
267465 270332 <i>Three cars, one champion!</i>
282514 284004 No you don't.
286718 288709 Hey!
295693 297593 What a ride!
298997 301192 Go get 'em, McQueen!<br />Go get 'em!
305003 306834 I love you, Lightning!
306905 309567 Dinoco is all mine.
309641 311575 Trouble, turn three!
311643 314874 - Get through that, McQueen.<br />- Huge crash behind the leaders!
336768 339635 Wait a second, Darrell.<br />McQueen is in the wreckage.
339704 342537 There's no way the rookie<br />can make it through!
342607 343835 Not in one piece, that is.
358456 360151 Yeah!
360225 362193 Lightning! Oh!
364095 366563 Look at that!<br />McQueen made it through!
366631 369099 A spectacular move<br />by Lightning McQueen!
369167 371294 Yeah! Ka-chow!
371369 374634 McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!<br />McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
374706 377675 Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow!
377742 379972 While everyone<br />heads into the pits,
380044 381807 McQueen stays out to take the lead!
381880 384872 Don't take me out, coach.<br />I can still race!
389621 392089 What do you think?<br />A thing of beauty.
392156 394090 - McQueen made it!<br />- What?
394158 395216 He's not pitting!
395293 398421 You gotta get me out there!<br />Let's go! Get me back out there!
398496 400259 McQueen's not going into the pits!
400331 403892 The rookie fired his<br />crew chief. The third this season!
403968 406266 - Says he likes working alone.<br />- Go, go!
406337 408567 Looks like Chick<br />got caught up in the pits.
408640 412041 Yeah, after a stop like that,<br />he's got a lot of ground to make up.
412110 414510 Get ready, boys,<br />we're coming to the restart!
432764 434493 Come on, come on, come on!
442874 444967 We need tires now!<br />Come on, let's go!
445043 447739 - No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!<br />- What?
447879 449938 You need tires, you idiot!
450281 453250 Looks like it's<br />gas-and-go's for McQueen today.
453318 454751 Right. No tires again.
454819 457515 That's a short-term gain,<br />long-term loss,
457588 461251 but it's workin' for him. He obviously<br />knows somethin' we don't know.
469367 473599 This is it, Darrell. One lap to go<br />and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.
473671 476538 He's got it in the bag.<br />Call in the dogs and put out the fire!
476607 478905 We're gonna crown us a new champion!
485383 487613 Checkered flag, here I come!
487685 489676 No! McQueen's blown a tire!
489754 492484 And with only one turn to go!<br />Can he make it?
492557 495117 You fool!
496494 498962 McQueen's blown a tire!<br />He's blown a tire!
499030 500520 Go, go, go!
509707 511436 He's lost another tire!
511509 514740 - King and Chick come up fast!<br />- They're entering turn three!
514812 516677 Come on.
518549 520779 I don't believe<br />what I'm watching, Bob!
520852 524379 Lightning McQueen<br />is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!
530128 532722 The King and Chick<br />rounding turn four.
535600 538865 Down the stretch they come!<br />And it's, and it's...
538936 541734 - It's too close to call! Too close!<br />- I don't believe it!
541806 543171 Lightning!
543474 546466 - The most spectacular, amazing...<br />- I don't believe it!
546544 550002 ...unequivocally, unbelievable ending<br />in the history of the world!
550081 552106 - And we don't know who won!<br />- Look at that!
562794 565820 - That's very close to call.<br />- Can we play that again?
565897 568092 Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!
568166 570700 <i>We're here in Victory Lane,<br />awaiting the results.</i>
570768 573236 <i>McQueen, that was a risky move,<br />not taking tires.</i>
573304 574293 <i>Tell me about it!</i>
574372 577034 <i>Are you sorry you didn't have<br />a crew chief out there?</i>
577108 580544 <i>Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing<br />than just winning.</i>
580611 584513 <i>I mean, taking the race by a full lap...<br />Where's the entertainment in that?</i>
584582 586516 <i>I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.</i>
586584 588711 <i>- Sizzle?<br />- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?</i>
588786 590947 <i>No, I'm not.<br />'Cause I'm a one-man show.</i>
591022 592455 <i>What? Oh, yeah, right.</i>
592523 594582 <i>That was a confident<br />Lightning McQueen.</i>
594659 597287 Live from Victory Lane,<br />I'm Kori Turbowitz.
597361 599056 - Get outta the shot.<br />- Yo, Chuck.
599130 600825 Chuck, what are you doing?<br />You're blockin' the camera!
600898 602889 - Everyone wants to see the bolt.<br />- What?
602967 606562 - Now, back away.<br />- That's it! Come on, guys.
606637 610698 - Whoa, team! Where are you going?<br />- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!
610775 612470 Oh, OK, leave. Fine.
612543 616309 How will I ever find anyone else<br />who knows how to fill me up with gas?
617448 620349 - Adios, Chuck!<br />- And my name is not Chuck!
620418 622079 Oh, whatever.
622153 624178 Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!
624255 627554 Seriously, that was some<br />pretty darn nice racin' out there.
627625 629855 - By me!<br />- Oh, yeah.
629927 632452 - Zinger!<br />- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!
632530 635192 The Piston Cup...<br />It's mine, dude. It's mine.
635266 639828 Hey, fellas, how do you think<br />I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!
639904 641735 In your dreams, Thunder.
641806 644900 Yeah, right. Thunder?<br />What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?
644976 647809 You know, 'cause thunder<br />always comes after lightning.
647879 649676 Ka-ping! Ka-pow!
649747 652181 - Who knew about the thunder thing?<br />- I didn't.
652250 653945 - Give us the bolt!<br />- That's right.
654018 655485 Right in the lens.
655653 657814 - Show me the bolt, baby!<br />- Smile, McQueen!
657889 661188 - Show me the bolt, McQueen!<br />- That's it!
666497 670957 That was one close finish.<br />You sure made Dinoco proud.
671035 672024 Thank you, King.
672103 674867 Well, Tex, you've been<br />good to me all these years.
674939 676304 It's the least I could do.
676374 679605 Whatever happens, you're a winner<br />to me, you old daddy rabbit.
679677 682475 Thanks, dear.<br />Wouldn't be nothing without you.
682547 684242 Kch-i-ka-chow!
685316 686977 - I'm Mia.<br />- I'm Tia.
687051 690316 We're, like, your biggest fans!<br />Ka-chow!
690388 692879 I love being me.
692957 696051 - OK, girls, that's it.<br />- We love you, Lightning!
698029 700862 Hey, buddy.<br />You're one gutsy racer.
700932 702490 Oh, hey, Mr. The King.
702567 704364 You got more talent in one lug nut
704435 706995 than a lot of cars has got<br />in their whole body.
707071 709665 - Really? Oh, that...<br />- But you're stupid.
709740 712300 - Excuse me?<br />- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.
712376 715470 You need to wise up and get<br />a good crew chief and a good team.
715546 718572 You ain't gonna win<br />unless you got good folks behind you,
718649 721948 and you let them<br />do their job, like they should.
722019 724749 - Like I tell the boys at the shop...<br />- A good team.
724822 726722 Yeah...
734498 736022 Ka-chow! Ka-pow!
755820 757811 Oh, Lightning!
759257 762090 If you figure that out<br />you just gonna be OK.
762159 765788 Oh, yeah, that...<br />That is spectacular advice.
765863 767296 Thank you, Mr. The King.
767365 769458 Ladies and gentlemen,
769533 771763 for the first time<br />in Piston Cup history...
771836 775533 A rookie<br />has won the Piston Cup.
775940 776998 Yes!
777074 780009 ...we have a three-way tie.
786851 789718 Hey,<br />that must be really embarrassing.
789787 792449 But I wouldn't worry about it.<br />Because I didn't do it!
793524 796925 Piston Cup officials<br />have determined that a tiebreaker race
796994 801226 between the three leaders<br />will be held in California in one week.
801465 804730 Well, thank you! Thanks to<br />all of you out there! Thank you!
804802 808499 Hey, first one to<br />California gets Dinoco all to himself.
808572 811541 No, not me!<br />No, you rock, and you know that!
815746 818044 Oh, yeah! Whoo!
819984 821246 Yep! All right! Got it!
821319 824777 "First one to California<br />gets Dinoco all to himself. "
824855 827483 Oh, we'll see<br />who gets there first, Chick.
827558 828650 Huh?
828726 832059 - Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.<br />- I don't want to talk about it.
832129 834996 Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.<br />What'd you do with my trailer?
835066 837261 - I parked it at your sponsor's tent.<br />- What?
837335 839326 Gotta make your personal appearance.
839403 841963 No. No! No, no, no, no!
842106 844506 <i>Yes, yes, yes!<br />Lightning McQueen here.</i>
844575 848204 <i>And I use Rust-eze Medicated<br />Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!</i>
848279 851976 <i>Nothing soothes a rusty bumper<br />like Rust-eze.</i>
852383 854817 <i>Wow! Look at that shine!</i>
854885 858616 <i>Use Rust-eze and you too<br />can look like me!</i>
858689 859951 <i>Ka-chow!</i>
862693 865218 I met this car from Swampscott.
865296 868356 He was so rusty<br />he didn't even cast a shadow.
868432 871299 You could see his dirty undercarriage.
871369 875601 I hate rusty cars.<br />This is not good for my image.
875673 879074 They did give you your big break.<br />Besides, it's in your contract.
879143 882044 Oh, will you stop, please?<br />Just go get hooked up.
882113 886072 - Winter is a grand old time.<br />- Of this there are no ifs or buts.
886150 888584 But remember,<br />all that salt and grime...
888652 890620 Can rust your bolts and freeze your...
890688 892656 Hey, look! There he is!
892723 894691 Our almost champ!
894759 896420 Get your rear end in here.
896494 898519 Lightning McQueen,<br />you are wicked fast!
898596 900757 - That race was a pisser!<br />- You were booking!
900831 902890 - Give me a little room.<br />- You're my hero!
902967 904798 Yes, I know.
904869 906427 "Fred. " Fred, thank you.
906570 909095 He knows my name.<br />He knows my name!
909940 911134 Looking good, Freddie!
911208 913676 Thanks to you, Lightning,<br />we had a banner year!
913744 916269 We might clear enough<br />to buy you some headlights.
916347 918372 You saying he doesn't have headlights?
918449 920781 That's what I'm telling ya.<br />They're stickers!
920851 923843 Well, you know,<br />racecars don't need headlights,
923921 925912 because the track is always lit.
925990 929187 Yeah, well, so is my brother,<br />but he still needs headlights.
934098 937864 - Ladies and gentlemen,<br />- Lightning McQueen!
940838 942772 Free Bird!
942840 946173 You know, the Rust-eze Medicated<br />Bumper Ointment team
946243 948108 ran a great race today.
948512 950844 And remember, with a little Rust-eze...
950948 953109 And an insane<br />amount of luck,
953184 957712 ...you too, can look like me.<br />Ka-chow.
960357 961824 - Hey, kid.<br />- We love ya.
961892 964360 And we're looking forward<br />to another great year.
964428 965725 Just like this year!
967131 969599 Not on your life.
969834 973395 - Don't drive like my brother!<br />- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!
973471 976463 <i>California, here we come!</i>
976574 979236 Dinoco, here we come!

1442940 1445465 Oh, maybe he can help me!
1445542 1447806 He's shooting at me!<br />Why is he shooting at me?
1448979 1451243 I haven't gone this fast in years.
1451315 1454148 I'm gonna<br />blow a gasket or somethin'.
1454217 1456549 Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!
1456620 1458315 What in the blue blazes?
1458388 1459912 Crazy hot-rodder.
1520917 1525513 I'm telling you, man,<br />every third blink is slower.
1530027 1532689 The sixties weren't good to you,<br />were they?
1542139 1545302 What? That's not the Interstate!

1560757 1563783 I'm not the only one seeing this, right?
1564227 1565922 - Incoming!<br />- Whoa, man.
1565996 1567327 - No!<br />- Hey!
1568365 1569662 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
1570634 1571896 My tires!
1617547 1620778 Fly away, Stanley. Be free!
1630460 1633896 Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.
1637334 1640064 <i>We're live at the Los Angeles<br />International Speedway</i>
1640137 1642662 <i>as the first competitor,<br />Lightning McQueen,</i>
1642739 1645037 <i>is arriving at the track.</i>
1645108 1647042 <i>Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?</i>
1647110 1648270 <i>What's your strategy?</i>
1650313 1653009 <i>What? Did I forget<br />to wipe my mud flaps?</i>
1654551 1657918 <i>McQueen's driver arrived in California,<br />but McQueen was missing.</i>
1657988 1661947 <i>- McQueen was reported missing.<br />- ... to race an unprecedented...</i>
1662025 1664585 <i>Sponsor stated<br />they have no idea where he is.</i>
1667531 1671023 I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate<br />to see anything bad happen to him.
1671101 1675299 <i>I don't know what's harder to find,<br />McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!</i>
1675372 1678466 <i>Lightning McQueen<br />must be found at all costs!</i>
1678542 1682501 <i>They're all asking the same question:<br />Where is McQueen?</i>
1683480 1685641 Oh, boy.
1686650 1688777 Where am I?
1688919 1691444 - Mornin', sleepin' beauty!<br />- Ah!
1692155 1694646 Boy, I was wonderin'<br />when you was gonna wake up.
1694724 1697420 Take whatever you want!<br />Just don't hurt me!
1697694 1700390 A parking boot?<br />Why do I have a parking boot on?
1700463 1705423 - What's going on here? Please!<br />- You're funny.
1705502 1708562 I like you already. My name's Mater.
1710073 1711062 Mater?
1711141 1714076 Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"<br />but without the "tuh".
1714144 1717409 - What's your name?<br />- You don't know my name?
1717480 1718469 Uh...
1718548 1721949 No, I know your name.<br />Is your name Mater too?
1722018 1723042 What?
1723119 1727886 Look, I need to get to California<br />as fast as possible. Where am I?
1727958 1730222 Where are you? Shoot!
1730293 1731851 You're in Radiator Springs.
1731928 1735329 The cutest little town<br />in Carburetor County.
1735398 1738265 Oh, great. Just great!
1738335 1742863 Well, if you think that's great,<br />you should see the rest of the town.
1742939 1746739 You know,<br />I'd love to see the rest of the town!
1746943 1749776 So if you could just open the gate,<br />take this boot off,
1749846 1752576 you and me, we go cruisin',<br />check out the local scene...
1752649 1754879 - Dad-gum!<br />- How'd that be, Tuhmater?
1754951 1756475 - Cool!<br />- Mater!
1756553 1759420 What did I tell you<br />about talkin' to the accused?
1759489 1760979 To not to.
1761057 1765494 Well, quit your yappin' and tow this<br />delinquent road hazard to traffic court.
1765562 1767655 Well, we'll talk later, Mater.
1767731 1770598 "Later, Mater. "<br />That's funny!
1770867 1771856 Ah!
1771935 1775632 The Radiator Springs<br />Traffic Court will come to order!
1775705 1779232 Hey, you scratched my paint!<br />I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!
1779309 1781709 You broke-a the road!<br />You a very bad car!
1781778 1782802 - Fascist!<br />- Commie!
1782879 1785575 Officer, talk to me, babe.<br />How long is this gonna take?
1785649 1787412 I gotta get to California, pronto.
1787484 1788644 Where's your lawyer?
1788718 1791983 I don't know. Tahiti maybe.<br />He's got a timeshare there.
1792055 1797186 When a defendant has no lawyer,<br />the court will assign one to him. Hey!
1797260 1799251 Anyone want to be his lawyer?
1800630 1802962 Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!
1803033 1806799 All rise! The Honorable<br />Doc Hudson presiding.
1807137 1808263 Show-off.
1808338 1811671 May Doc have mercy on your soul.
1811741 1812935 All right,
1813009 1816137 I wanna know who's responsible<br />for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.
1816212 1818112 I want his hood on a platter!
1818181 1820843 I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!<br />No, check that.
1820917 1824683 I'm gonna put him in jail till<br />the jail rots on top of him,
1824754 1828417 and then I'm gonna move him<br />to a new jail and let that jail rot.
1828491 1830015 I'm...
1831995 1833929 Throw him out of here, Sheriff.
1833997 1837364 I want him out of my courtroom.<br />I want him out of our town!
1837500 1839092 - Case dismissed.<br />- Yes!
1839169 1841433 Boy, I'm purty good<br />at this lawyerin' stuff.
1841504 1842971 Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!
1844007 1848000 Holy Porsche! She's gotta be<br />from my attorney's office.
1848078 1850546 Hey, thanks for comin',<br />but we're all set.
1850613 1853047 - He's letting me go.<br />- He's letting you go?
1853116 1855050 Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.
1855118 1858281 All you have to do now is stand there<br />and let me look at you.
1858355 1861916 Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.<br />Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!
1862325 1863952 - What the...? Ow! Oh!<br />- Ka-chow!
1864027 1867087 - Please!<br />- I know. I get that reaction a lot.
1867230 1870757 I create feelings in others that<br />they themselves don't understand.
1870834 1872495 Agh! Ow!
1872569 1874969 Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?
1875038 1877063 A little bit, but I'll be all right.
1877140 1880906 OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.
1880977 1883571 Do what you gotta do, baby.<br />But listen. Be careful.
1883646 1887343 Folks around here are not firing on<br />all cylinders, if you know what I mean.
1887450 1889418 Ka-ching!
1889486 1890578 Ah!
1890720 1892654 I'll keep that in mind.
1892822 1895222 - Hey there, Mater.<br />- Howdy, Sally.
1895592 1897890 - Hi, folks!<br />- Good morning!
1898628 1899617 You know her?
1899696 1902665 She's the town attorney and my fianc�e.
1902732 1903721 What?
1903800 1907896 Nah, I'm just kiddin'.<br />She just likes me for my body.
1907971 1911805 You look great. You do something<br />different with your side view mirrors?
1911875 1913536 What do you want, Sally?
1913610 1916977 Come on, make this guy<br />fix the road. The town needs this.
1917046 1920209 No. I know his type. Racecar.
1920283 1922342 That's the last thing this town needs.
1922419 1926913 OK, I didn't want to have to do this,<br />Doc, but you leave me no choice.
1926990 1930926 Fellow citizens, you're all aware<br />of our town's proud history.
1930994 1932427 Here she goes again.
1932495 1935191 Radiator Springs,<br />the glorious jewel
1935265 1938894 strung on the necklace<br />of Route 66, the mother road!
1938968 1942768 It is our job and our pleasure<br />to take care of the travelers
1942839 1945831 - on our stretch of that road.<br />- Travelers? What travelers?
1945909 1947069 Ignore him.
1947143 1950510 But how, I ask you,<br />are we to care for those travelers
1950580 1952912 if there is no road<br />for them to drive on?
1952982 1955780 - Luigi, what do you have at your store?<br />- Tires.
1955852 1957342 And if no one can get to you?
1957420 1961754 I won't sell any... tires.<br />I will lose everything!
1961825 1964658 - Flo, what do you have at your store?<br />- I have gas.
1964727 1968128 - Lotsa gas!<br />- OK boys, stay with me.
1968198 1971725 And, Flo, what'll happen if no one<br />can come to your station to buy gas?
1971801 1975293 I'll go outta business and...<br />we'll have to leave town.
1975371 1978499 What's gonna happen if Flo<br />leaves town and closes her station?
1978575 1981135 - Without gas, we're done for!<br />- What?
1981211 1984044 Don't you think the car responsible<br />should fix our road?
1984113 1987344 The only guy strong enough<br />to fix that road is Big Al!
1987417 1989647 Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.
1989719 1991744 Then why are you bringing<br />him up, you lemon?
1991821 1992810 Oh, he can do it.
1992889 1995687 He's got the horsepower.<br />So, what do you want him to do?
1995758 1997225 Fix the road!
1997293 2000854 - Because we are a town worth fixing!<br />- Yeah!
2002265 2005462 Order in the court!
2006236 2009000 Seems like my mind<br />has been changed for me.
2009072 2011063 - Yeah!<br />- No!
2011140 2012471 Nice ruling.
2013209 2016701 Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.
2016779 2020647 That's OK, Stickers.<br />You can take Bessie.
2020850 2022545 Man, you get to work with Bessie!
2022619 2025247 I'd give my left two lug nuts<br />for somethin' like that.
2025321 2027983 Bessie? Who's Bessie?
2030193 2034152 This here is Bessie,<br />finest road-pavin' machine ever built.
2034230 2037290 I'm hereby sentencing you<br />to community service.
2037367 2040097 You're gonna fix the road<br />under my supervision.
2040169 2042501 What? This place is crazy!
2042572 2044733 I know this may be<br />a bad time right now,
2044807 2047799 but you owe me $32,000<br />in legal fees.
2047877 2048866 What?
2048945 2052506 We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,<br />and you're gonna pull her nice.
2052582 2054174 You gotta be kidding me.
2054250 2056912 You start there where the road begins.
2057287 2060279 You finish down there<br />where the road ends.
2062258 2064522 Holy shoot!
2065061 2067461 Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br />How long is this gonna take?
2067530 2071091 Well, fella does it right,<br />should take him about five days.
2071167 2072327 Five days?
2072402 2075337 But I should be in California<br />schmoozing Dinoco right now!
2075405 2078374 Then if I were you,<br />I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!
2078441 2080932 - Hook him up, Mater.<br />- Okay-dokey.
2089018 2091248 Freedom!
2096559 2100086 Maybe I should've<br />hooked him up to Bessie...
2100863 2104162 ...and then...<br />then took the boot off.
2105635 2108035 Whoo-hoo!
2108771 2112764 Goodbye, Radiator Springs,<br />and goodbye, Bessie!
2112842 2116710 California, here I come! Yeah!
2119082 2121073 Oh, feel that wind.
2121517 2123109 Yes!
2124287 2126312 No. No, no, no.
2126623 2128921 No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?
2128992 2130983 How can I be outta gas?
2131060 2135019 Boy, we ain't<br />as dumb as you think we are.
2135098 2137430 But how did,<br />how did... you...?
2137500 2139832 We siphoned your gas<br />while you were passed out.
2139902 2142803 - Ka-chow.<br />- Ow, ow, ow, ow.
2151214 2153614 - Gentlemen.<br />- Sheriff.
2153683 2154775 Hey, Sheriff.
2154851 2157115 <i>- Why here?<br />- Sono sempre stati qui.</i>
2157186 2159677 <i>- They were better before.<br />- Stai sempre a parlare.</i>
2159756 2161621 - Guido!<br />- Red, can you move over?
2161691 2164524 I want to get a look<br />at that sexy hot rod.
2164594 2167427 You know, I used to be<br />a purty good whistler.
2167497 2170227 I can't do it now, of course,<br />on account of sometimes
2170299 2173200 I get fluid built up<br />in my engine block,
2173269 2176636 but Doc said he's gonna fix it.<br />He can fix about anything.
2176706 2178936 That's why we made him the judge.
2179108 2183272 <i>Boy, you shoulda heard me on<br />Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.</i>
2183346 2184711 Now, I'm not one to brag
2184781 2188080 but people come purty far<br />to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".
2188551 2189575 Oh!
2189652 2192485 - Aw, man, that's just great!<br />- Hey, what's wrong?
2192555 2194352 My lucky sticker's all dirty.
2194424 2196688 Ah, that ain't nothin'.<br />I'll clean it for ya.
2196759 2201458 No, no, no!
2201531 2203863 That won't be necessary.
2204934 2208233 Hey! Hey, big fella!<br />Yeah, you in the red!
2208304 2210932 I could use a little hose down.<br />Help me wash this off.
2213376 2214365 Where's he goin'?
2214444 2217880 Oh, he's a little bit shy, and<br />he hates you for killin' his flowers.
2217947 2219471 I shouldn't put up with this.
2219549 2222416 I'm a precision instrument<br />of speed and aerodynamics.
2222485 2225511 - You hurt your what?<br />- I'm a very famous racecar!
2225788 2228985 You are a famous racecar?<br />A real racecar?
2229058 2231686 Yes, I'm a real racecar.<br />What do you think? Look at me.
2231761 2235754 I have followed racing my entire life.<br />My whole life!
2235832 2238130 Then you know who I am.<br />I'm Lightning McQueen.
2238201 2240294 - Lightning McQueen?<br />- Yes! Yes!
2240369 2242360 I must scream it to the world!
2242438 2246670 My excitement from the top<br />of someplace very high!
2246743 2249234 - Do you know many Ferraris?<br />- No, no, no, no, no.
2249312 2252281 They race on the European circuit.<br />I'm in the Piston Cup!
2253049 2255984 - What?<br />- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.
2260857 2263417 Is that what I think it is?
2264994 2266256 Customers.
2266329 2269787 Customers!<br />Customers, everyone! Customers!
2269866 2271231 - OK!<br />- Customers?
2271300 2274133 Been a long time.<br />Remember what we rehearsed.
2274203 2276763 Make sure your<br />"Open, please come in" signs are out.
2276839 2280366 You all know what to do.<br />All right, nobody panics. Here we go!
2280443 2283105 Van, I just don't see<br />any on-ramp anywhere.
2283179 2287582 - Minny, I know exactly where we are.<br />- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.
2287650 2290312 - Honey, please.<br />- Hello.
2290386 2293355 Welcome to Radiator Springs,<br />gateway to Ornament Valley.
2293422 2295686 Legendary for<br />its service and hospitality.
2295758 2296782 How can we help you?
2296859 2300920 - We don't need anything, thank you.<br />- Ask for directions to the Interstate.
2300997 2304228 There's no need to ask for directions.<br />I know where we're going.
2304300 2306734 He did the same thing<br />on our trip to Shakopee.
2306803 2309636 We were headed over there<br />for the Crazy Days, and we...
2309705 2312765 - OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?<br />- What you really need
2312842 2316903 is the sweet taste<br />of my homemade, organic fuel.
2316979 2318674 No, it doesn't agree with my tank.
2318748 2321945 - Just trying to find the Interstate.<br />- Good to see you, soldier!
2322018 2325351 Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut<br />for your government surplus needs.
2325421 2327753 - Honey, surplus!<br />- We have too much surplus.
2327824 2330156 I do have a map<br />over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

2355918 2359081 Ramone will paint you up right.<br />Hey, anything you want!
2359155 2361453 - You know, like a flame job.<br />- No thanks...

2397526 2398993 No, not really. But listen.
2399061 2402690 I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.<br />I'm being held against my will.
2402765 2405290 I need you to call my team,<br />so they can come rescue me
2405368 2409202 and get me to California in time for me<br />to win the Piston Cup. Understand?
2410172 2412436 <i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>
2412508 2416376 No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!<br />You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!
2416445 2419608 I'm in hillbilly hell!<br />My IQ's dropping by the second!
2419682 2421775 I'm becoming one of them!
2423653 2425780 OK, don't worry.<br />They know where we are now.
2425855 2427618 They'll tell friends. You'll see.
2427690 2430557 <i>We'll be back<br />for our Hank Williams marathon...</i>
2430626 2433356 <i>- That's good.<br />- ... after a Piston Cup update.</i>
2433429 2437331 <i>Still no sign of Lightning<br />McQueen. Chick arrived in California</i>
2437400 2440858 <i>and today became the first car<br />to spend practice time on the track.</i>
2440937 2444100 <i>It's nice to get out here<br />before the other competitors.</i>
2444173 2447939 <i>You know, get a head start.<br />Gives me an edge.</i>
2451380 2453177 Hoo-hoo-hoo!
2458254 2459243 Ha-ha!
2463092 2464081 Yeah!
2475705 2478037 Hey, McQueen...<br />Eat your heart out.
2478507 2480338 Oh!
2480409 2481774 Let me get this straight.
2481844 2484779 I can go when this road is done.<br />That's the deal, right?
2484847 2488578 - That's what they done did said.<br />- OK. Outta my way.
2488651 2489743 I got a road to finish.
2501597 2503997 - He's done!<br />- Done?
2504066 2506432 - Uh-huh.<br />- It's only been an hour.
2508371 2511704 Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.
2511774 2514641 Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.<br />That's all you gotta say.
2515244 2518907 Whee-hoo!<br />I'm the first one on the new road!
2519482 2521074 Oh!
2522418 2525114 It rides purty smooth.
2525354 2528812 - It looks awful!<br />- Well, it matches the rest of the town.
2528924 2532416 Oh!
2532795 2534786 Red.
2537400 2538731 Who do you think you are?
2538801 2542100 Look, Doc said when I finish,<br />I could go. That was the deal.
2542171 2545607 The deal was you fix the road,<br />not make it worse.
2545674 2548142 Now, scrape it off!<br />Start over again.
2548210 2551839 Hey, look, grandpa,<br />I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.
2551914 2553404 Oh-ho-ho-ho!
2553482 2557714 Is that right? Then why don't we<br />just have a little race? Me and you.
2557787 2561587 - What?<br />- Me and you. That a joke?
2561657 2564023 If you win, you go and I fix the road.
2564093 2566789 If I win, you do the road my way.
2566862 2568386 Doc, what're you doin'?
2568764 2570595 I don't mean to be rude here,
2570666 2574397 but you probably go zero to sixty in,<br />like, what? Three-point-five years?
2574470 2576995 Then I reckon<br />you ain't got nothin' to worry about.
2577073 2581737 You know what, old-timer?<br />That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.
2583479 2586004 Gentlemen,<br />this will be a one-lap race.
2586082 2590576 You will drive to Willy's Butte,<br />go around Willy's Butte and come back.
2590653 2593588 There will be no bumpin',<br />no cheatin', no spittin',
2593656 2596181 no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',
2596258 2601389 no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',<br />no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',
2601464 2603227 and no lollygaggin'.
2603299 2604857 Speed. I'm speed.
2604934 2607494 Float like a Cadillac,<br />sting like a Beemer.
2608737 2613538 My friend Guido, he dream to give<br />a real racecar a pit stop.
2613609 2616134 - Peet stop!<br />- Uh...
2616212 2619079 The race is only one lap, guys.
2619148 2621639 <i>Uno lappo! Don't need any help.</i>
2621717 2625551 <i>- I work solo mio.<br />- Fine. Race your way.</i>
2626856 2630724 - No pit stoppo. Comprendo?<br />- OK.
2630826 2632817 Gentlemen...
2633462 2636295 ...start your engines!
2643072 2645438 <i>- Hijole! Check that out!<br />- Whoa.</i>
2645508 2648602 Great idea, Doc.<br />Now the road will never get done.
2648978 2650275 Luigi?
2650346 2653543 On your mark, get set...
2653616 2655846 <i>Uno for the money,<br />due for the show,</i>
2655918 2661618 <i>tre to get ready, and quattro<br />to... I can't believe it. Go!</i>
2670099 2671430 Huh?
2672067 2674592 Doc... the flag means go.
2674670 2678003 Remember the fl...<br />Here we go. Go.
2678073 2680803 Doc, what are you doing, man?
2680876 2684437 Oh, dear. It would seem<br />I'm off to a poor start.
2684513 2687641 Well, better late than never.<br />Come on, Mater.
2687716 2690480 - Might need a little help.<br />- Uh... OK.
2692188 2693621 You got your tow cable?
2693689 2695884 Well, yeah,<br />I always got my tow cable. Why?
2695958 2698256 Oh, just in case.
2706802 2708997 Ow! Ow!<br />Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
2709071 2710800 No, no, no, no, no!
2710940 2713340 - Oh, man!<br />- Whoa.
2714076 2716374 - Ow!<br />- Bad trip, man.
2719548 2725544 Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac<br />or was that stingin' like a Beemer?
2725621 2727987 I'm confused.
2728057 2730150 You drive like you fix roads.
2730226 2733423 Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.
2737233 2739064 Ah!
2739802 2742771 I'm startin' to think he knowed<br />you was gonna crash!
2742838 2745966 Thank you, Mater. Thank you.
2749078 2751012 I can make a little turn on dirt.
2751080 2752513 You think?
2752581 2757041 No. And now I'm a day behind.<br />I'm never gonna get outta here!
2757119 2759587 <i>Hey, �se!<br />You need a new paint job, man!</i>
2759655 2762624 - No, thank you.<br />- How 'bout some organic fuel?
2762691 2765057 - That freak juice?<br />- Pass.
2765127 2769587 Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.<br />Anybody else want somethin' to drink?
2769665 2771257 Nah, not me, Flo.
2771333 2773801 I'm on one of them there special diets.
2773869 2778465 I'm a precisional instrument<br />of speed and aero-matics.
2779041 2781305 "You race like you fix roads. "
2781377 2786144 I'll show him.<br />I will show him!
2794490 2798824 Oh, great! I hate it!
2798894 2802523 - Hate, hate, hate, hate it!<br />- Music. Sweet music.
2803732 2806292 Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
2806368 2809098 Radiator Springs, a happy place!
2809171 2812197 OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?
2814743 2818543 Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!<br />I'm talking to Bessie!
2831593 2832651 Wow.
2832995 2834690 Mornin', Sally!
2834763 2839962 Hey, look at this here fancy new road<br />that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!
2840035 2842060 Yes! Uh, amazing!
2842538 2846167 Whoa-ho! Yeah!
2846241 2850439 Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't<br />seen you that low in years.
2850512 2853072 I haven't seen a road like this<br />in years.
2853148 2857278 - Well, then let's cruise, baby.<br />- Low and slow.
2857353 2859548 <i>E bellissima! It's beautiful!</i>
2859621 2863352 Guido, look, it's-a like<br />it was paved by angels.
2864293 2865590 Boy, I tell you what.
2865661 2868494 I bet even the roads on the moon<br />ain't this smooth.
2868564 2870225 Doc, look at this!
2870366 2873233 Shoulda tossed him into<br />the cactus a lot sooner, huh?
2873302 2876794 Well, he ain't finished yet.<br />Still got a long way to go.
2876872 2879841 Guido, look at Luigi!
2880442 2882171 <i>This is fantastico!</i>
2882244 2885702 That looks like fun!<br />Mater, I got dibs, next turn!
2885781 2890081 Hey, Luigi, this new road<br />makes your place look like a dump.
2890753 2893449 That crazy old devil woman.
2893922 2897323 Oh!
2897393 2899224 She's right!
2899294 2900852 - Ah!<br />- Guido!
2900929 2904695 Huh. That punk actually did a good job.
2905968 2909768 Well, now... where the heck is he?
2916111 2918841 Sheriff!<br />Is he makin' another run for it?
2918914 2922281 No, no. He ran outta asphalt<br />in the middle of the night,
2922351 2924717 and asked me if he could<br />come down here.
2924787 2927187 All he's tryin' to do<br />is make that there turn.
2927256 2930089 No, no, no, no! Oh, great.
2930559 2933084 Perfect turns on every track<br />I've ever raced on.
2935297 2939256 Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself<br />a quart of oil at Flo's.
2939334 2940733 I'll keep an eye on him.
2940803 2944705 Well, thanks, Doc.<br />I've been feelin' a quart low.
2959087 2961555 This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.
2961623 2964353 Oh, great. What do you want?<br />You here to gloat?
2964426 2967759 You don't have three-wheel brakes,<br />so you got to pitch it hard,
2967830 2971322 break it loose and then<br />just drive it with the throttle.
2971400 2974460 Give it too much, you'll be<br />outta the dirt and into the tulips.
2974536 2977630 So you're a judge,<br />a doctor and a racing expert.
2977706 2979367 I'll put it simple.
2979441 2983605 If you're goin' hard enough left,<br />you'll find yourself turnin' right.
2984680 2990084 Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.<br />Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!
2990152 2991949 Or should I say, "No, thank you"?
2992020 2995615 Because in Opposite World,<br />maybe that really means, "Thank you"!
2998427 3001828 Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!
3009471 3011405 Turn right to go left.
3012674 3014665 Hmm...
3014743 3015801 Whoa!
3017179 3019613 Oh!
3020082 3024041 Ow! Oh, that...
3025621 3028988 Ow!
3030425 3033690 Turn right to go left.<br />Guess what. I tried it.
3033762 3036856 You know what? This crazy thing<br />happened... I went right!
3036932 3040333 You keep talkin' to yourself,<br />people'll think you're crazy.
3040402 3044338 - Thanks for the tip.<br />- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!
3051213 3054774 <i>- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!<br />- Che cosa?</i>
3054850 3059219 <i>- It looks great! This is great!<br />- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.</i>
3061823 3063814 Oh, Lord.
3063892 3065519 Mater!
3065594 3067755 I need you<br />to watch the prisoner tonight.
3067829 3071128 Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.<br />What if he tries to run again?
3071199 3074032 Just let him run outta gas<br />and tow him on back.
3074102 3076570 - But keep an eye on him.<br />- Yes, sir!
3077673 3079334 Oh...
3079408 3082070 While I'm stuck here<br />paving this stinkin' road,
3082144 3084704 Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.
3084780 3088045 My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br />Who's touching me?
3088116 3090414 You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.
3090485 3092510 You make-a such a nice new road.
3092588 3095250 You come to my shop.<br />Luigi take-a good care of you.
3095324 3096916 Even though you not a Ferrari.
3096992 3101088 You buy four tires,<br />I give you a full-a size spare
3101163 3105031 - absolutely free!<br />- Look, I get all my tires for free.
3105100 3108627 I like your style, eh?
3108704 3112265 You drive the hard bargain.<br />OK. Luigi make you a new deal.
3112341 3115799 You buy one tire,<br />I give you three for free!
3115877 3117538 Oh, would you look at that?
3117613 3119740 Ramone, Ramone!
3119815 3121908 Then Luigi make you<br />a new new deal.
3121984 3124976 No, no, no, no.<br />Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.
3125053 3128682 - No, no, no, no. No.<br />- This is it. My last offer.
3128757 3133456 You buy one tire, I give you<br />seven-a snow tires for free!
3133528 3136395 Done. You interested, you call me.<br />You know where I am.
3137799 3138959 Ah!
3139034 3141161 Stop! Let me...
3142571 3145404 Oh, Red, you missed a spot.<br />See it right there?
3145474 3147499 - No! No!<br />- On the hood right there.
3147576 3150909 Stop, stop! That's cold!
3150979 3153470 Help! Please! Stop!
3153548 3156915 Thanks, Red.
3158153 3159415 What was that for?
3159488 3161615 - Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?<br />- Huh?
3161690 3163180 If you do, you gotta be clean.
3163258 3165783 'Cause even in hillbilly hell<br />we have standards.
3165861 3167590 What, I...? I don't get it.
3167663 3170257 I thought I'd say thank you<br />for doin' a great job.
3170332 3173563 So I thought I'd let you stay with me.<br />I mean, not with me!
3173635 3178265 But there. Not with me there,<br />but there in your own cozy cone.
3178340 3182208 - And I'd be in my cone, and it's...<br />- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.
3182277 3184677 If you want to stay<br />at the dirty impound, fine.
3184746 3188011 - I understand you criminal types.<br />- No, no, no, no. That's OK.
3188083 3191280 - Yeah, the Cozy Cone.<br />- It's newly refurbished.
3191353 3194811 Yeah,<br />it's like a clever little twist.
3194890 3199020 The motel's made out of caution cones,<br />which, of course, cars try to avoid.
3199094 3202461 But now we're gonna stay in them.<br />That's funny.
3203965 3206195 Figure that all out on your own,<br />did you?
3207169 3209637 Cone number one, if you want.
3210739 3213105 Oh...
3214242 3217973 Hey, do I spy a little<br />pinstriping tattoo back there?
3218046 3221140 Oh...<br />That's just a... Oh!
3223719 3227052 Oh, you saw that? Yeah.<br />Just gonna be going.
3227122 3229750 Gonna... Yeah.
3234496 3237090 You know, I knew this girl Doreen.
3237165 3238655 Good-lookin' girl.
3238734 3242033 Looked just like a Jaguar,<br />only she was a truck!
3242104 3245596 You know, I used to crash into her,<br />just so I could spoke to her.
3246708 3249176 - What are you talking about?<br />- I don't know.
3249244 3253374 Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,<br />'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!
3253448 3257612 No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,<br />and I have to get out of here.
3257686 3261247 Well, that's all right,<br />Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.
3261323 3263621 You probably couldn't handle it anyway.
3263692 3265455 Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.
3265527 3268519 You know who you're talkin' to?<br />This is Lightning McQueen.
3268597 3270929 I can handle anything.
3270999 3275834 - I'm not doin' this.<br />- Come on. You'll love it!
3276104 3279631 - Tractor-tippin's fun.<br />- This is ridiculous.

3494409 3495398 Oh...
3495477 3500744 - Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?<br />- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?
3500815 3505081 Besides, she can't stand me.<br />And I don't like her, to be honest.
3505153 3509055 Yeah, you probably right.<br />Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!
3509124 3511854 Where, where?
3511927 3514521 - You're in love with Miss Sally.<br />- No, I'm not.
3514596 3516757 - Yes, you do.<br />- No way.

3527943 3529934 - Will you stop that?<br />- Stop what?
3530011 3533310 Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.<br />You're gonna wreck.
3533381 3538284 Wreck? Shoot!<br />I'm the world's best backwards driver!
3538353 3541481 You just watch this right here,<br />lover boy. Wee-hee!

3580862 3582591 Just need to know where I've been.
3582664 3585792 Whoa, that was incredible!<br />How'd you do that?
3585867 3589860 Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,<br />and I'll teach you if you want.
3589938 3593169 Yeah,<br />maybe I'll use it in my big race.
3593241 3596768 What's so important<br />about this race of yours, anyway?
3598279 3602010 It's not just a race.<br />We're talking about the Piston Cup!
3602083 3604415 I've been dreaming about it<br />my whole life!
3604486 3607512 I'll be the first rookie in history<br />ever to win it.
3607589 3611150 And when I do,<br />we're talkin' big new sponsor,
3611226 3612887 with private helicopters.
3612961 3616226 No more medicated bumper ointment.<br />No more rusty old cars.
3616297 3618424 What's wrong with rusty old cars?
3620235 3623864 Well, I don't mean you, Mater.<br />I mean other old cars. You know?
3623938 3627101 - Not like you. I like you.<br />- It's OK, buddy.
3627442 3632141 Hey, you think maybe one day I can<br />get a ride in one of them helicopters?
3632213 3636809 I mean, I've always wanted to ride<br />in one of them fancy helicopters.
3636885 3639683 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.<br />- You mean it?
3639754 3641517 Oh, yeah. Anything you say.

3694409 3697139 When? Just now?<br />What, what did, what did you hear?
3697212 3699203 Something about a helicopter ride.
3699681 3702445 Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got<br />a kick out of that, didn't he?
3702517 3704417 - Did you mean it?<br />- What?

3716331 3718697 Yeah, OK.
3718766 3721462 - Did you mean that?<br />- What?
3721536 3727168 Was it just a "Yeah, OK",<br />or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?
3727242 3729904 Look, I'm exhausted.<br />It's kinda been a long day.
3730645 3733478 Yeah, OK. G'night.
3735917 3737077 Oh...
3737152 3739347 Hey, thank you.
3741656 3743317 What did you just say?
3744025 3746220 You know,<br />thanks for lettin' me stay here.
3746294 3750162 It's nice to be out of the impound,<br />and this is... It's great.
3750231 3753792 - Newly refurbished, right?<br />- Yeah.
3754702 3757227 - G'night.<br />- Good night.
3761442 3762932 Hmm.
3778422 3781448 Will you turn<br />that disrespectful junk off?
3781525 3785359 Respect the classics, man.<br />It's Hendrix!
3796374 3797864 Ah!
3804281 3805407 No!
3811589 3814888 No!
3815259 3816692 I gotta get outta here!
3817161 3820096 Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?<br />Oh! Oh, my gosh.
3820164 3823429 - Hey, what are you doin'?<br />- Get a good peek, city boy?
3823501 3826993 I just need my<br />daily gas ration from the Sheriff.
3827071 3829198 Wait for him at Flo's.<br />Get outta here.
3829273 3831935 I've been trying<br />to get outta here for three days!
3832009 3834500 Hope you enjoyed the show!
3848092 3849889 Whoa, Doc.
3849960 3853691 Time to clean out the garage, buddy,<br />come on.
3869547 3871378 What?
3872483 3875281 He has a Piston Cup?
3882359 3884122 Oh, my gosh.
3885496 3887521 Three Piston Cups?
3899844 3901835 Sign says stay out.
3902680 3905274 You have three Piston Cups.<br />How could you have...
3905349 3908443 I knew you couldn't drive.<br />I didn't know you couldn't read.
3908519 3911545 - You're the Hudson Hornet!<br />- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!
3911622 3914147 Of course. I can't believe<br />I didn't see it before.
3914225 3915954 You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
3916026 3919689 You used to hold the record for most<br />wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.
3919763 3922493 - You gotta show me your tricks. Please.<br />- I tried that.
3922566 3925296 You won three times!<br />Look at those trophies!
3925369 3928805 You look.<br />All I see is a bunch of empty cups.
3934044 3939346 You know, some automotive yoga<br />could really lower your RPM's, man.
3939416 3941213 Oh, take a car wash, hippie.
3941285 3944516 Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!<br />Whoo! That's your color!
3944588 3948319 - Yellow, baby.<br />- Mmm. You smokin' hot!
3948392 3949450 There he is.
3949527 3952519 Oh, my gosh!<br />Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?
3955766 3958530 - Doc? Our Doc?<br />- Not Doc Hudson.
3958602 3961196 No, no, no, no, it's true!<br />He's a real racing legend.
3961272 3963536 He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
3963607 3966906 Fabulous? I never seen Doc<br />drive more than 20 miles an hour.
3966977 3969036 I mean, have you ever seen him race?
3969113 3972708 No, but I wish I could have.<br />They say he was amazing!
3972783 3976651 - He won three Piston Cups!<br />- He did what in his cup?
3976720 3979052 I think the heat's<br />startin' to get to the boy!
3979123 3981250 Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.
3981325 3983725 I think he needs<br />a new coat of poly, man.
3983794 3986558 - Are you sick, buddy?<br />- You are lookin' peaked.
3986630 3988393 He needs a new coat of poly for sure!
3990701 3994228 - Hey! What are you doin'?<br />- It's OK. You can trust me, right?
3994305 3997001 I trust you, all right.<br />It's him I'm worried about.
3997942 4000274 Hmm... I trust him.
4001245 4003543 - Come on, let's take a drive.<br />- A drive?
4003614 4004911 Yeah, a drive.
4004982 4008110 Don't you big city racecars<br />ever just take a drive?
4008185 4010881 Ah... No. No, we don't.
4033377 4037211 Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?
4043020 4044214 Mm-hm!
4044288 4047746 - And you thought he was gonna run.<br />- Hey, can you believe it, man?
4047825 4050259 He actually thought<br />Doc was a famous racecar!
4051295 4053263 That's so too much!
4055299 4057767 OK, you got me out here.<br />Where are we goin'?
4057835 4059826 I don't know.
4064708 4066699 Whoa! Yes.
4083527 4085154 Oh! Ah-ha-ha!
4085229 4088892 Bleah!
4152830 4154889 Oh!
4175152 4178883 Wow. What is this place?
4179590 4180955 Wheel Well.
4181024 4184289 Used to be the most popular stop<br />on the mother road.
4188932 4190661 This place?
4194271 4196330 Yeah, imagine.
4198008 4200738 Oh, imagine what<br />it must have been like to stay here.
4203080 4204638 You know, I don't get you.
4204715 4207946 How does a Porsche<br />wind up in a place like this?
4208018 4210213 Well, it's really pretty simple.<br />I was...
4210287 4214451 ...an attorney in LA<br />livin' life in the fast lane, and...
4214525 4218086 Oh, you were, were you?<br />Were you rich?
4218162 4221563 - What?<br />- Just... clues to the puzzle.
4222332 4224960 Yeah, OK.<br />Well, that was my life.
4225035 4226798 And you know what?
4226870 4230499 It never felt... happy.
4232142 4235236 Yeah. I mean... really?
4235312 4237041 Yeah. So I left California.
4237114 4240413 Just drove and drove<br />and finally broke down right here.
4241151 4243949 Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.
4244021 4247013 Well, they all did. And I never left.
4248292 4249987 Yeah. You know, I understand.
4250060 4252893 You need a little R and R.<br />Recharge the old batteries.
4252963 4256694 But you know, after a while,<br />why didn't you go back?
4257668 4261126 I fell in love.
4261205 4264868 - Oh.<br />- Yep.
4265709 4268507 - Corvette?<br />- No.
4274051 4276815 I fell in love with this.
4288832 4292563 Whoa. Look at that.
4293437 4295769 Look, they're drivin' right by.
4295839 4298034 They don't even know<br />what they're missing!
4299042 4301374 Well,<br />it didn't used to be that way.
4302846 4304177 Oh, yeah?
4304248 4308150 Yeah. Forty years ago,<br />that Interstate down there didn't exist.
4309286 4310275 Really?
4310354 4313050 Yeah. Back then,
4313123 4315990 cars came across the country<br />a whole different way.
4317261 4318592 How do you mean?
4318662 4322063 The road didn't cut through the land<br />like that Interstate.
4322132 4326330 It moved with the land, you know?<br />It rose, it fell, it curved.
4327838 4329829 - Mornin'!<br />- Nice day, huh?
4331742 4334540 Cars didn't drive on it<br />to make great time.
4334611 4337171 They drove on it to have a great time.
4371181 4373581 Well, what happened?
4373650 4377108 The town got bypassed<br />just to save ten minutes of driving.
4463273 4466868 How great would it have been<br />to see this place in its heyday!
4466943 4469741 Oh, I can't tell you how many times<br />I've dreamed of that.
4469813 4473476 But one of these days we'll<br />find a way to get it back on the map.
4473550 4477213 Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.
4477287 4479118 I had a great time.
4479189 4481919 It's kinda nice to slow down<br />every once in a while.
4482559 4484720 You're welcome.
4492102 4493364 Hey, listen, listen!
4493437 4496531 If anybody asks you,<br />we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?
4496606 4498699 Wha... what?
4514024 4516083 Oh, man, the paint's still wet!
4526703 4528568 No, no, no, no!<br />Get out of the store!
4528638 4532233 Hey! Don't eat the radial!<br />Here, take-a the snow tires.
4532309 4534607 - Mater!<br />- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!
4534678 4537704 Then where did all these<br />gol-durn tractors come from?
4537948 4540280 - Whoa, boy!<br />- Hey! Hey, guys!
4540350 4542318 There's one goin' this way.
4543286 4545481 I got it.
4548992 4551290 Come here, little tractor,<br />come here.
4551361 4553625 Yeah, that's a good tractor.
4553697 4555062 No, no, no, no, come here.
4555132 4556497 What are you doing?
4556566 4559262 You're not supposed to go<br />wandering off all...
4559569 4561935 ...alone.
4572315 4576547 What are you doin'<br />with those old racin' tires?
4583226 4585524 Come on, Doc, drive.
4663406 4665203 Ah... Yeah.
4665275 4666936 - Wow.<br />- Huh?
4667010 4668602 You're amazing!
4670580 4672844 What are you doin'?
4672916 4674611 Doc, wait!
4678488 4680922 Giddup right in there!<br />Come on, Rusty.
4683827 4687024 Doc, hold it!<br />Seriously, your driving's incredible!
4687097 4690396 - Wonderful. Now, go away.<br />- Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!
4690467 4692298 - I'm askin' you to leave.<br />- Come on.
4692369 4695361 I'm a racecar,<br />you're a much older racecar,
4695438 4697429 but under the hood<br />you and I are the same.
4697507 4700567 We are not the same!<br />Understand? Now, get out.
4700644 4703579 How could a car like you quit<br />at the top of your game?
4705448 4707916 You think I quit?
4720497 4722192 Right.
4722832 4725460 Your big wreck in '54.
4726202 4728500 They quit on me.
4728571 4732132 When I finally got put together,<br />I went back expecting a big welcome.
4732208 4735109 You know what they said?<br />"You're history. "
4735178 4738238 Moved right on to<br />the next rookie standing in line.
4741084 4743314 There was a lot left in me.
4744054 4747046 I never got a chance to show 'em.
4748558 4752585 I keep that to remind me<br />never to go back.
4753763 4756926 I just never expected that<br />that world would...
4757000 4759195 ...would find me here.
4760303 4762897 - Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.<br />- Oh, yeah?
4762972 4763961 No, I'm not.
4764040 4767874 When is the last time you cared about<br />something except yourself, hot rod?
4767944 4772540 You name me one time<br />and I will take it all back.
4774384 4777376 Uh-huh. I didn't think so.
4777787 4781553 These are good folk around here,<br />who care about one another.
4782192 4785320 I don't want 'em depending<br />on someone they can't count on.
4785895 4787920 Oh, like you?<br />You've been here how long
4787997 4790227 and your friends<br />don't even know who you are?
4790900 4792959 Who's caring about only himself?
4793036 4795834 Just finish that road<br />and get outta here!
4809986 4812682 Will you turn that<br />disrespectful junk off?
4812756 4815190 Respect the classics, man.
4824934 4827732 Ah...
4841651 4843016 He's done.
4843086 4846317 He must've finished it<br />while we was all sleepin'.
4846389 4848619 Good riddance.
4856499 4857932 He's gone?
4858001 4861027 Well, we wouldn't want him<br />to miss that race of his.
4866476 4870810 - Oh, dude, are you crying?<br />- No! I'm happy!
4870880 4873849 I don't have to watch him<br />every second of the day anymore!
4873917 4875111 I'm glad he's gone!
4881724 4883521 What's wrong with Red?
4883593 4886994 Oh, he's just sad<br />'cause you left town
4887063 4889998 and went to your big race to win<br />the Piston Cup
4890066 4892933 that you've always dreamed about<br />your whole life
4893002 4898531 and get that big ol' sponsor and that<br />fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.
4903179 4905477 Wait a minute!
4906883 4909716 I knowed you wouldn't leave<br />without saying goodbye.
4909786 4912516 What are you doin' here?<br />You're gonna miss your race.
4912589 4916252 Don't worry. I'll give you<br />a police escort, and we'll make up time.
4916326 4917486 Thank you, Sheriff.
4917560 4919687 But you know I can't go just yet.
4919762 4921252 Well, why not?
4921331 4924164 I'm not sure these tires...
4924234 4927135 ...can get me to California.<br />- Peet stop?
4927203 4930468 Yeah, does anybody know<br />what time Luigi's opens?
4930540 4931875 I can't-a believe it!<br />Four new tires!
4931910 4933706 I can't-a believe it!<br />Four new tires!
4933910 4936504 <i>Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!</i>
4936579 4940675 - Would you look at that!<br />- Our first customer in years!
4940750 4944345 I am filled with tears of ecstasy,
4944420 4948288 for this is the most glorious day<br />of my life!
4948358 4952351 All right, Luigi, give me<br />the best set of blackwalls you've got.
4952562 4953790 No! No, no, no.
4953863 4957230 You don't-a know what you want.<br />Luigi know what you want.
4958368 4962737 Blackwall tires.<br />They blend into the pavement.
4962805 4964272 But-a this...
4964574 4966405 Whitewall tires!
4966476 4971641 They say, "Look at me!<br />Here I am! Love me. "
4971714 4973511 All right, you're the expert.
4973583 4976518 Don't forget the spare.
4976586 4979419 <i>- Perfetto. Guido!<br />- Peet stop!</i>
4990800 4993735 What did Luigi tell you, eh?
4993803 4997261 Wow, you were right.<br />Better than a Ferrari, huh?
4998041 4999201 Eh... No.
5003079 5006674 Wow! This organic fuel is great!<br />Why haven't I heard about it before?
5006749 5008740 It's a conspiracy, man!
5008818 5011286 The oil companies got a grip<br />on the government!
5011354 5014585 They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.
5014657 5016784 OK, I'll take a case.
5031841 5033308 Ow! Eh!
5042151 5043778 Ah... Yeah.
5044320 5045844 Ka-chow.
5046723 5049692 - Here she comes!<br />- Places, everybody. Hurry!
5049759 5051488 Act natural.
5051561 5052892 <i>- Hi, Sally.<br />- Buon giorno!</i>
5052962 5054793 All right, what's goin' on?
5054864 5057025 Ladies and gentlecars,
5057100 5061036 please welcome<br />the new Lightning McQueen!
5061671 5063662 Pow! What do you think?
5063740 5065935 Radiator Springs<br />looks pretty good on me.
5066009 5067806 I'll say.
5067877 5071074 Ka-chow.
5071147 5073672 You're gonna fit right in<br />in California.
5074550 5077678 My goodness. It looks like<br />you've helped everybody in town.
5077754 5079585 Yeah, everybody except one.
5080823 5085817 - Hey, is it getting dark out?<br />- What? What'd he say?
5085895 5088921 Let me say that again.<br />Is it getting dark out?
5088998 5091193 Now, what was I<br />supposed to do after that?
5115191 5117989 They fixed their neon!
5125401 5130395 - Low and slow?<br />- Oh, yeah, baby!
5134711 5138044 Just like in its heyday, right?
5138114 5141481 It's even better than I pictured it.<br />Thank you.
5168911 5170344 Shall we cruise?
5170413 5172745 Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!
5172815 5174282 - No, no, no.<br />- Lizzie!
5174350 5178684 I remember when Stanley<br />first asked me to take a drive with him.
5178755 5181622 Hey, Miss Sally.<br />May I have this cruise?
5181691 5185058 - Of course, Mater.<br />- Uh-uh-uh!
5191534 5195903 ...and again and I said, "No. "<br />He asked me again, and I said, "No. "
5195972 5200306 But, oh, he was a persistent<br />little bugger for a two-cylinder.
5200376 5203777 Finally I said,<br />"All right, one little drive. "
5205948 5208940 Oh!
5213289 5215416 - Hey!<br />- Thanks, Mater.
5215491 5217789 Good evenin', you two.
5220296 5225529 Oh, Stanley,<br />I wish you could see this.
5229639 5233439 - Is that what I think it is?<br />- Oh, I don't know, Flo.
5233509 5239175 I haven't had a chance to find out.<br />But I am going to find out. Hello.
5239248 5241842 Not that. That.
5241918 5241984 Customers?
5242019 5244316 Customers?
5244387 5247049 Customers, everybody!<br />And a lot of 'em!
5247123 5249284 You know what to do.<br />Just like we rehearsed.
5250426 5253020 It's the ghostlight!
5253095 5255689 We have found McQueen.<br />We have found McQueen!
5256566 5258033 McQueen, over here!
5258100 5260864 - Wait, excuse me.<br />- Is it true you've been in rehab?
5260937 5263064 - Did you have a nervous breakdown?<br />- What?
5263139 5265869 - McQueen's wearing whitewalls!<br />- Your tires balding?
5265942 5266931 Stickers!
5267009 5269170 - Was McQueen your prisoner?<br />- Shoot, no!
5269245 5271713 We're best buds!<br />I ain't braggin' or nothin',
5271781 5274978 but I was in charge of huntin' him down<br />if he tried to escape.
5275051 5276643 Sally! Sally!
5276719 5278778 Will you still race for the Piston Cup?
5278855 5280584 - Stickers?<br />- Sally!

5297874 5299739 Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.
5299809 5302403 <i>Is that the world's<br />fastest racing machine?</i>

5493235 5496033 I didn't get to say goodbye to him.
5555598 5558931 Hello, race fans. Welcome<br />to what has become, quite simply,
5559001 5561299 the biggest event<br />in the history of racing.
5561370 5563600 A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!
5563672 5566140 There's a crowd<br />of nearly 200,000 cars
5566208 5568768 here at the Los Angeles<br />International Speedway.
5568844 5573178 Tickets to this race are hotter than a<br />black leather seat on a hot summer day!
5573249 5575809 The King, Chick Hicks<br />and Lightning McQueen
5575885 5579218 in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,<br />tiebreaker race.
5579288 5582519 I got a lotta miles on me,<br />but let me tell you somethin'.
5582591 5586584 I never thought I'd see anything<br />like this. This is exciting!
5586662 5588994 In fact, the country<br />has almost shut down
5589064 5593160 to watch what many experts<br />are calling "the race of the century. "
5593235 5595863 Hey, King!<br />Good luck in your last race.
5595938 5600034 - You've sure been an inspiration to me.<br />- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.
5600109 5603203 - Hey, be careful out there, OK?<br />- Yeah, man.
5603279 5604268 He's hot!
5604346 5607008 Wanna know the forecast?<br />I'll give you the forecast.
5607082 5610176 A 100 percent chance of thunder!<br />Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
5610252 5612777 Say it with me!<br />Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
5612855 5615790 Hey, you! No admittance<br />without a garage pass.
5615858 5618622 Oh, it's OK.<br />Lightning McQueen knows me!
5618694 5621822 Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day<br />for a race, isn't it?
5621897 5626857 - Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.<br />- And good morning to you, Fred.
5626936 5630838 Mario Andretti knows my name!<br />You gotta let me in now!
5630906 5632168 Sorry, pal.
5632241 5636507 OK, here we go.<br />Focus. Speed.
5637279 5640077 I am speed.
5641817 5643011 Victory.
5643085 5645212 One winner, two losers.
5647323 5652852 Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...
5658033 5659625 Lightnin'! You ready?
5659702 5662398 Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.
5675751 5678584 Mack, thanks for being<br />my pit crew today.
5678654 5681248 Don't worry about it, kid.<br />It's the least I could do.
5681323 5683723 After all, "Gas Can"<br />is my middle name.
5683792 5686158 - It is?<br />- Ah... Not really.
5703445 5704844 Uh-oh
5715724 5718693 Nelson! Zoom in.<br />Ready, 16? Take 16.
5718861 5721091 And there he is,<br />Lightning McQueen!
5721163 5724291 Missing all week, and then he turns up<br />in the middle of nowhere!
5724366 5726766 In a little town<br />called Radiator Springs.
5726835 5729895 Wearin' whitewall tires,<br />of all things.
5731040 5734168 - Oh!<br />- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
5735477 5737809 Hey, where you been?<br />I've been kinda lonely.
5737880 5740781 Nobody to hang out with.<br />I mean, except the Dinoco folks.
5740849 5743841 And the twins. Of course.<br />The ones that used to be your fans,
5743919 5747082 but now they're my fans.<br />Listen to what the twins think...
5753929 5755988 Agh! Shoot!
5756065 5759193 Boogity, boogity, boogity,<br />boys! Let's go racin'!
5765474 5767032 Come on, you can do it!
5767109 5769134 Come on, King, make us proud, boy!
5770346 5773543 Fifty laps down, and The King<br />is still holding a slim lead.
5773615 5776846 McQueen's got a run on him!<br />He's lookin' to the inside!
5779021 5781182 Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!
5781256 5783656 Chick's not<br />making it easy on him today.
5783726 5785455 He lost momentum,
5785527 5787825 and now he's gonna have to<br />chase him back down!
5797239 5799298 McQueen spins out in the infield!
5803278 5805872 Just me<br />and the old man, fellas.
5805948 5809475 McQueen just doesn't have it today.
5810652 5814713 - Hey, kid, are you all right?<br />- I don't know, Mack.
5814790 5816223 I don't think I...
5816291 5819021 I didn't come all this way<br />to see you quit.
5819261 5820785 Doc?
5823465 5826093 Guys, you're here!<br />I can't believe this!
5826168 5829934 I knew you needed a crew chief,<br />but I didn't know it was this bad.
5830005 5831905 You said you'd never come back.
5831974 5835569 Well, I really didn't have a choice.<br />Mater didn't get to say goodbye.
5835644 5838545 Goodbye! OK, I'm good.
5842518 5846010 All right, if you can drive as good<br />as you can fix a road
5846088 5849353 then you can win this race<br />with your eyes shut.
5849425 5851416 Now, get back out there!
5853662 5856631 Hot snot, we are back in business!<br />Guido! Luigi!
5856698 5858996 You're goin' up<br />against professional pit crews.
5859067 5862230 - You're gonna have to be fast.<br />- They will not know what bit them!
5862304 5863999 Kid, you can beat these guys.
5864072 5867473 Find a groove that works for you<br />and get that lap back.
5879188 5881088 - Is it?<br />- Oh, wow. That's him!
5881156 5884922 Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!<br />The Hudson Hornet's back!
5884993 5887621 It appears McQueen<br />has got himself a pit crew.
5887696 5890096 And look who he has for a crew chief!
5890165 5892861 - Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!<br />- Whoa!
5892935 5896268 Well, dip me in axle grease<br />and call me Slick! It surely is.
5900909 5902934 <i>Wow, this is history<br />in the making.</i>
5903011 5905912 <i>Nobody has seen the racing legend<br />in over 50 years!</i>
5905981 5907380 Hey, Doc!
5907449 5911613 Come look at this fellow on the radio.<br />He looks just like you.
5916525 5920325 - McQueen passes on the inside!<br />- He's nearly a lap down.
5920395 5923296 Can he catch up to them<br />with only 60 laps to go?
5923365 5926266 You're goin' great, kid.<br />Just keep your head on.

6015657 6017784 We gotta get him<br />back out there fast
6017859 6020794 or we're gonna be a lap down,<br />and we'll never win this race!

6079254 6082781 A hundred and ninety-nine<br />laps! It all comes down to this!

6194970 6197962 You just gave up the Piston Cup,<br />you know that?
6198039 6201634 This grumpy old racecar I know<br />once told me somethin'.
6201710 6203769 It's just an empty cup.
6205881 6208441 Darrell, is pushing<br />on the last lap legal?

6323164 6325928 How'd you like to become<br />the new face of Dinoco?
6330639 6332106 But I didn't win.
6332173 6335836 Lightnin', there's a whole lot<br />more to racin' than just winnin'.
6335911 6338607 He was so rusty,<br />when he drove down the street

6390565 6394001 Hi. Lightning McQueen told me<br />this was the best place in the world
6394069 6395058 to get tires.
6395136 6399334 How 'bout setting me and my friends up<br />with three or four sets each?
