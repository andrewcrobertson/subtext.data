38365 41495 OK... Here we go. Focus.
41575 44935 Speed. I am speed.
46645 49375 One winner, 42 losers.
49445 52005 I eat losers for breakfast.
54115 55545 Breakfast.
55615 57715 Wait, maybe I<br />should have had breakfast.
57785 61485 A little breck-y could be good for me.<br />No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.
63195 65425 I'm faster than fast.<br />Quicker than quick.
65495 67085 I am lightning!
68235 70525 Hey, Lightning! You ready?
72165 75335 Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready
113605 114705 Ka-chow!
161895 163885 Get your antenna balls here!
170465 172625 Go, Lightnin'!
172705 176695 - Whoo!<br />- You got that right, slick.
190215 192205 Uh!
202695 205535 Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.
205605 209225 I'm Bob Cutlass, here<br />with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.
209305 212295 <i>We're midway through what may<br />be an historic day for racing.</i>
212375 214395 <i>Bob, my oil pressure's<br />through the roof.</i>
214475 218075 <i>If this gets more exciting, they're<br />gonna have to tow me outta the booth!</i>
218145 219205 <i>Right, Darrell.</i>
219285 221905 <i>Three cars are tied<br />for the season points lead,</i>
221985 224075 <i>heading into the final race<br />of the season.</i>
224155 228915 <i>And the winner of this race will win<br />the season title and the Piston Cup.</i>
228995 230685 <i>Does The King, Strip Weathers,</i>
230755 233155 <i>have one more victory in him<br />before retirement?</i>
233225 235825 <i>He's been Dinoco's golden boy<br />for years!</i>
235895 238095 <i>Can he win them one last Piston Cup?</i>
238165 241535 <i>And, as always, in the<br />second place spot we find Chick Hicks.</i>
241605 244125 <i>He's been chasing<br />that tailfin his entire career.</i>
244205 246365 <i>Chick thought<br />this was his year.</i>
246445 249205 <i>His chance to finally emerge<br />from The King's shadow.</i>
249275 253335 <i>But the last thing he expected was...<br />Lightning McQueen!</i>
253415 256045 <i>You know, I don't think<br />anybody expected this.</i>
256115 258745 <i>The rookie sensation<br />came into the season unknown.</i>
258825 260315 <i>But everyone knows him now.</i>
260385 264445 <i>Will he be the first rookie<br />to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?</i>
264555 267115 <i>The legend, the runner-up,<br />and the rookie!</i>
267195 270065 <i>Three cars, one champion!</i>
282245 283735 No you don't.
286445 288435 Hey!
295425 297325 What a ride!
298725 300925 Go get 'em, McQueen!<br />Go get 'em!
304735 306565 I love you, Lightning!
306635 309295 Dinoco is all mine.
309375 311305 Trouble, turn three!
311375 314605 - Get through that, McQueen.<br />- Huge crash behind the leaders!
336495 339365 Wait a second, Darrell.<br />McQueen is in the wreckage.
339435 342265 There's no way the rookie<br />can make it through!
342335 343565 Not in one piece, that is.
358185 359885 Yeah!
359955 361925 Lightning! Oh!
363825 366295 Look at that!<br />McQueen made it through!
366365 368825 A spectacular move<br />by Lightning McQueen!
368895 371025 Yeah! Ka-chow!
371095 374365 McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!<br />McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
374435 377405 Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow!
377475 379705 While everyone<br />heads into the pits,
379775 381535 McQueen stays out to take the lead!
381615 384605 Don't take me out, coach.<br />I can still race!
389355 391815 What do you think?<br />A thing of beauty.
391885 393825 - McQueen made it!<br />- What?
393885 394945 He's not pitting!
395025 398155 You gotta get me out there!<br />Let's go! Get me back out there!
398225 399985 McQueen's not going into the pits!
400065 403625 The rookie fired his<br />crew chief. The third this season!
403695 405995 - Says he likes working alone.<br />- Go, go!
406065 408295 Looks like Chick<br />got caught up in the pits.
408375 411775 Yeah, after a stop like that,<br />he's got a lot of ground to make up.
411845 414245 Get ready, boys,<br />we're coming to the restart!
432495 434225 Come on, come on, come on!
442605 444695 We need tires now!<br />Come on, let's go!
444775 447465 - No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!<br />- What?
447605 449665 You need tires, you idiot!
450015 452985 Looks like it's<br />gas-and-go's for McQueen today.
453045 454485 Right. No tires again.
454545 457245 That's a short-term gain,<br />long-term loss,
457315 460985 but it's workin' for him. He obviously<br />knows somethin' we don't know.
469095 473325 This is it, Darrell. One lap to go<br />and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.
473405 476265 He's got it in the bag.<br />Call in the dogs and put out the fire!
476335 478635 We're gonna crown us a new champion!
485115 487345 Checkered flag, here I come!
487415 489405 No! McQueen's blown a tire!
489485 492215 And with only one turn to go!<br />Can he make it?
492285 494845 You fool!
496225 498695 McQueen's blown a tire!<br />He's blown a tire!
498765 500255 Go, go, go!
509435 511165 He's lost another tire!
511235 514475 - King and Chick come up fast!<br />- They're entering turn three!
514545 516405 Come on.
518275 520505 I don't believe<br />what I'm watching, Bob!
520585 524105 Lightning McQueen<br />is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!
529855 532455 The King and Chick<br />rounding turn four.
535335 538595 Down the stretch they come!<br />And it's, and it's...
538665 541465 - It's too close to call! Too close!<br />- I don't believe it!
541535 542905 Lightning!
543205 546195 - The most spectacular, amazing...<br />- I don't believe it!
546275 549735 ...unequivocally, unbelievable ending<br />in the history of the world!
549815 551835 - And we don't know who won!<br />- Look at that!
562525 565555 - That's very close to call.<br />- Can we play that again?
565625 567825 Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!
567895 570435 <i>We're here in Victory Lane,<br />awaiting the results.</i>
570495 572965 <i>McQueen, that was a risky move,<br />not taking tires.</i>
573035 574025 <i>Tell me about it!</i>
574105 576765 <i>Are you sorry you didn't have<br />a crew chief out there?</i>
576835 580275 <i>Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing<br />than just winning.</i>
580345 584245 <i>I mean, taking the race by a full lap...<br />Where's the entertainment in that?</i>
584315 586245 <i>I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.</i>
586315 588445 <i>- Sizzle?<br />- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?</i>
588515 590675 <i>No, I'm not.<br />'Cause I'm a one-man show.</i>
590755 592185 <i>What? Oh, yeah, right.</i>
592255 594315 <i>That was a confident<br />Lightning McQueen.</i>
594385 597015 Live from Victory Lane,<br />I'm Kori Turbowitz.
597095 598785 - Get outta the shot.<br />- Yo, Chuck.
598865 600555 Chuck, what are you doing?<br />You're blockin' the camera!
600625 602615 - Everyone wants to see the bolt.<br />- What?
602695 606295 - Now, back away.<br />- That's it! Come on, guys.
606365 610425 - Whoa, team! Where are you going?<br />- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!
610505 612205 Oh, OK, leave. Fine.
612275 616035 How will I ever find anyone else<br />who knows how to fill me up with gas?
617175 620075 - Adios, Chuck!<br />- And my name is not Chuck!
620145 621805 Oh, whatever.
621885 623905 Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!
623985 627285 Seriously, that was some<br />pretty darn nice racin' out there.
627355 629585 - By me!<br />- Oh, yeah.
629655 632185 - Zinger!<br />- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!
632265 634925 The Piston Cup...<br />It's mine, dude. It's mine.
634995 639555 Hey, fellas, how do you think<br />I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!
639635 641465 In your dreams, Thunder.
641535 644635 Yeah, right. Thunder?<br />What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?
644705 647535 You know, 'cause thunder<br />always comes after lightning.
647605 649405 Ka-ping! Ka-pow!
649475 651915 - Who knew about the thunder thing?<br />- I didn't.
651985 653675 - Give us the bolt!<br />- That's right.
653745 655215 Right in the lens.
655385 657545 - Show me the bolt, baby!<br />- Smile, McQueen!
657615 660915 - Show me the bolt, McQueen!<br />- That's it!
666225 670685 That was one close finish.<br />You sure made Dinoco proud.
670765 671755 Thank you, King.
671835 674595 Well, Tex, you've been<br />good to me all these years.
674665 676035 It's the least I could do.
676105 679335 Whatever happens, you're a winner<br />to me, you old daddy rabbit.
679405 682205 Thanks, dear.<br />Wouldn't be nothing without you.
682275 683975 Kch-i-ka-chow!
685045 686705 - I'm Mia.<br />- I'm Tia.
686785 690045 We're, like, your biggest fans!<br />Ka-chow!
690115 692605 I love being me.
692685 695785 - OK, girls, that's it.<br />- We love you, Lightning!
697755 700595 Hey, buddy.<br />You're one gutsy racer.
700665 702225 Oh, hey, Mr. The King.
702295 704095 You got more talent in one lug nut
704165 706725 than a lot of cars has got<br />in their whole body.
706805 709395 - Really? Oh, that...<br />- But you're stupid.
709475 712035 - Excuse me?<br />- This ain't a one-man deal, kid.
712105 715205 You need to wise up and get<br />a good crew chief and a good team.
715275 718305 You ain't gonna win<br />unless you got good folks behind you,
718375 721675 and you let them<br />do their job, like they should.
721745 724475 - Like I tell the boys at the shop...<br />- A good team.
724555 726455 Yeah...
734225 735755 Ka-chow! Ka-pow!
755555 757545 Oh, Lightning!
758985 761825 If you figure that out<br />you just gonna be OK.
761885 765515 Oh, yeah, that...<br />That is spectacular advice.
765595 767025 Thank you, Mr. The King.
767095 769185 Ladies and gentlemen,
769265 771495 for the first time<br />in Piston Cup history...
771565 775265 A rookie<br />has won the Piston Cup.
775675 776725 Yes!
776805 779735 ...we have a three-way tie.
786585 789445 Hey,<br />that must be really embarrassing.
789515 792175 But I wouldn't worry about it.<br />Because I didn't do it!
793255 796655 Piston Cup officials<br />have determined that a tiebreaker race
796725 800955 between the three leaders<br />will be held in California in one week.
801195 804465 Well, thank you! Thanks to<br />all of you out there! Thank you!
804535 808225 Hey, first one to<br />California gets Dinoco all to himself.
808305 811275 No, not me!<br />No, you rock, and you know that!
815475 817775 Oh, yeah! Whoo!
819715 820975 Yep! All right! Got it!
821045 824505 "First one to California<br />gets Dinoco all to himself."
824585 827215 Oh, we'll see<br />who gets there first, Chick.
827285 828385 Huh?
828455 831785 - Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie.<br />- I don't want to talk about it.
831855 834725 Let's go, Mack. Saddle up.<br />What'd you do with my trailer?
834795 836995 - I parked it at your sponsor's tent.<br />- What?
837065 839055 Gotta make your personal appearance.
839135 841695 No. No! No, no, no, no!
841835 844235 <i>Yes, yes, yes!<br />Lightning McQueen here.</i>
844305 847935 <i>And I use Rust-eze Medicated<br />Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!</i>
848005 851705 <i>Nothing soothes a rusty bumper<br />like Rust-eze.</i>
852115 854545 <i>Wow! Look at that shine!</i>
854615 858345 <i>Use Rust-eze and you too<br />can look like me!</i>
858415 859685 <i>Ka-chow!</i>
862425 864945 I met this car from Swampscott.
865025 868085 He was so rusty<br />he didn't even cast a shadow.
868165 871025 You could see his dirty undercarriage.
871095 875335 I hate rusty cars.<br />This is not good for my image.
875405 878805 They did give you your big break.<br />Besides, it's in your contract.
878875 881775 Oh, will you stop, please?<br />Just go get hooked up.
881845 885805 - Winter is a grand old time.<br />- Of this there are no ifs or buts.
885885 888315 But remember,<br />all that salt and grime...
888385 890355 Can rust your bolts and freeze your...
890415 892385 Hey, look! There he is!
892455 894425 Our almost champ!
894485 896155 Get your rear end in here.
896225 898245 Lightning McQueen,<br />you are wicked fast!
898325 900485 - That race was a pisser!<br />- You were booking!
900565 902625 - Give me a little room.<br />- You're my hero!
902695 904525 Yes, I know.
904595 906155 "Fred." Fred, thank you.
906305 908825 He knows my name.<br />He knows my name!
909675 910865 Looking good, Freddie!
910935 913405 Thanks to you, Lightning,<br />we had a banner year!
913475 915995 We might clear enough<br />to buy you some headlights.
916075 918105 You saying he doesn't have headlights?
918175 920515 That's what I'm telling ya.<br />They're stickers!
920585 923575 Well, you know,<br />racecars don't need headlights,
923655 925645 because the track is always lit.
925725 928915 Yeah, well, so is my brother,<br />but he still needs headlights.
933825 937595 - Ladies and gentlemen,<br />- Lightning McQueen!
940565 942505 Free Bird!
942575 945905 You know, the Rust-eze Medicated<br />Bumper Ointment team
945975 947835 ran a great race today.
948245 950575 And remember, with a little Rust-eze...
950675 952835 And an insane<br />amount of luck,
952915 957445 ...you too, can look like me.<br />Ka-chow.
960085 961555 - Hey, kid.<br />- We love ya.
961625 964095 And we're looking forward<br />to another great year.
964155 965455 Just like this year!
966865 969325 Not on your life.
969565 973125 - Don't drive like my brother!<br />- Yeah, don't drive like my brother!
973205 976195 <i>California, here we come!</i>
976305 978965 Dinoco, here we come!
1087185 1092715 Oh... oh... uh,<br />I needed this. Hello?
1092785 1096385 <i>Is this Lightning McQueen,<br />the world's fastest racing machine?</i>
1096455 1098585 Is this Harv,<br />the world's greatest agent?
1098655 1101425 <i>And it is such an honor<br />to be your agent</i>
1101495 1104525 <i>that it almost hurts me to take<br />ten percent of your winnings.</i>
1104595 1109695 <i>Merchandising. And ancillary rights in<br />perpetuity. Anyway, what a race, champ!</i>
1109775 1112265 <i>I didn't see it,<br />but I heard you were great.</i>
1112345 1113465 Thanks, Harv.
1113545 1117205 <i>Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets<br />for the tiebreaker thing in Cali.</i>
1117275 1119975 <i>I'll pass 'em on to your friends.<br />Shoot me the names.</i>
1120045 1123175 <i>- You let Harv rock it for you, baby.<br />- Right. Friends.</i>

1126985 1128715 <i>OK, I get it, Mr. Popular.</i>

1145675 1147695 What? A minivan?

1149545 1151875 <i>This is Lightning McQueen<br />you're hauling here.</i>
1151945 1154475 Just stopping off<br />for a quick breather, kid.

1157055 1160785 <i>We're driving all night till we<br />get to California. We agreed to it.</i>

1165125 1168185 <i>Come on, I need to get there<br />before Chick and hang with Dinoco.</i>
1168265 1170355 All those sleeping trucks.

1173235 1174665 Oh, sure you can, Mack.
1174735 1177065 Look, it'll be easy.<br />I'll stay up with you.

1440805 1442565 Oh, no.
1442675 1445195 Oh, maybe he can help me!
1445275 1447535 He's shooting at me!<br />Why is he shooting at me?
1448705 1450975 I haven't gone this fast in years.
1451045 1453875 I'm gonna<br />blow a gasket or somethin'.
1453945 1456275 Serpentine! Serpentine, serpentine!
1456355 1458045 What in the blue blazes?
1458115 1459645 Crazy hot-rodder.
1520645 1525245 I'm telling you, man,<br />every third blink is slower.
1529755 1532415 The sixties weren't good to you,<br />were they?
1541865 1545035 What? That's not the Interstate!
1545105 1546975 Ah! Oh!

1563955 1565655 - Incoming!<br />- Whoa, man.
1565725 1567055 - No!<br />- Hey!
1568095 1569395 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
1570365 1571625 My tires!
1617275 1620505 Fly away, Stanley. Be free!
1630195 1633625 Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.
1637065 1639795 <i>We're live at the Los Angeles<br />International Speedway</i>
1639865 1642395 <i>as the first competitor,<br />Lightning McQueen,</i>
1642465 1644765 <i>is arriving at the track.</i>
1644835 1646775 <i>Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?</i>
1646845 1648005 <i>What's your strategy?</i>
1650045 1652735 <i>What? Did I forget<br />to wipe my mud flaps?</i>
1654285 1657645 <i>McQueen's driver arrived in California,<br />but McQueen was missing.</i>
1657715 1661675 <i>- McQueen was reported missing.<br />...to race an unprecedented...</i>
1661755 1664315 <i>Sponsor stated<br />they have no idea where he is.</i>
1667265 1670755 I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate<br />to see anything bad happen to him.
1670835 1675025 <i>I don't know what's harder to find,<br />McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!</i>
1675105 1678195 <i>Lightning McQueen<br />must be found at all costs!</i>
1678275 1682235 <i>They're all asking the same question:<br />Where is McQueen?</i>
1683215 1685375 Oh, boy.
1686385 1688505 Where am I?
1688645 1691175 - Mornin', sleepin' beauty!<br />- Ah!
1691885 1694375 Boy, I was wonderin'<br />when you was gonna wake up.
1694455 1697155 Take whatever you want!<br />Just don't hurt me!
1697425 1700125 A parking boot?<br />Why do I have a parking boot on?
1700195 1705155 - What's going on here? Please!<br />- You're funny.
1705235 1708295 I like you already. My name's Mater.
1709805 1710795 Mater?
1710875 1713805 Yeah, like "tuh-mater,"<br />but without the "tuh".
1713875 1717135 - What's your name?<br />- You don't know my name?
1717215 1718195 Uh...
1718275 1721675 No, I know your name.<br />Is your name Mater too?
1721745 1722775 What?
1722845 1727615 Look, I need to get to California<br />as fast as possible. Where am I?
1727685 1729955 Where are you? Shoot!
1730025 1731585 You're in Radiator Springs.
1731655 1735055 The cutest little town<br />in Carburetor County.
1735125 1737995 Oh, great. Just great!
1738065 1742595 Well, if you think that's great,<br />you should see the rest of the town.
1742665 1746465 You know,<br />I'd love to see the rest of the town!
1746675 1749505 So if you could just open the gate,<br />take this boot off,
1749575 1752305 you and me, we go cruisin',<br />check out the local scene...
1752375 1754605 - Dad-gum!<br />- How'd that be, Tuhmater?
1754685 1756205 - Cool!<br />- Mater!
1756285 1759155 What did I tell you<br />about talkin' to the accused?
1759215 1760705 To not to.
1760785 1765225 Well, quit your yappin' and tow this<br />delinquent road hazard to traffic court.
1765295 1767385 Well, we'll talk later, Mater.
1767465 1770325 "Later, Mater."<br />That's funny!
1770595 1771585 Ah!
1771665 1775365 The Radiator Springs<br />Traffic Court will come to order!
1775435 1778965 Hey, you scratched my paint!<br />I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!
1779035 1781435 You broke-a the road!<br />You a very bad car!
1781505 1782535 - Fascist!<br />- Commie!
1782605 1785305 Officer, talk to me, babe.<br />How long is this gonna take?
1785375 1787145 I gotta get to California, pronto.
1787215 1788375 Where's your lawyer?
1788445 1791715 I don't know. Tahiti maybe.<br />He's got a timeshare there.
1791785 1796915 When a defendant has no lawyer,<br />the court will assign one to him. Hey!
1796995 1798985 Anyone want to be his lawyer?
1800365 1802695 Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!
1802765 1806525 All rise! The Honorable<br />Doc Hudson presiding.
1806865 1807995 Show-off.
1808065 1811405 May Doc have mercy on your soul.
1811475 1812665 All right,
1812735 1815865 I wanna know who's responsible<br />for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.
1815945 1817845 I want his hood on a platter!
1817915 1820575 I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!<br />No, check that.
1820645 1824415 I'm gonna put him in jail till<br />the jail rots on top of him,
1824485 1828145 and then I'm gonna move him<br />to a new jail and let that jail rot.
1828225 1829745 I'm...
1831725 1833655 Throw him out of here, Sheriff.
1833725 1837095 I want him out of my courtroom.<br />I want him out of our town!
1837235 1838825 - Case dismissed.<br />- Yes!
1838895 1841165 Boy, I'm purty good<br />at this lawyerin' stuff.
1841235 1842705 Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!
1843735 1847735 Holy Porsche! She's gotta be<br />from my attorney's office.
1847805 1850275 Hey, thanks for comin',<br />but we're all set.
1850345 1852775 - He's letting me go.<br />- He's letting you go?
1852845 1854785 Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.
1854845 1858015 All you have to do now is stand there<br />and let me look at you.
1858085 1861645 Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase.<br />Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!
1862055 1863685 - What the...? Ow! Oh!<br />- Ka-chow!
1863755 1866815 - Please!<br />- I know. I get that reaction a lot.
1866965 1870485 I create feelings in others that<br />they themselves don't understand.
1870565 1872225 Agh! Ow!
1872295 1874695 Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?
1874765 1876795 A little bit, but I'll be all right.
1876875 1880635 OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.
1880705 1883305 Do what you gotta do, baby.<br />But listen. Be careful.
1883375 1887075 Folks around here are not firing on<br />all cylinders, if you know what I mean.
1887185 1889145 Ka-ching!
1889215 1890305 Ah!
1890455 1892385 I'll keep that in mind.
1892555 1894955 - Hey there, Mater.<br />- Howdy, Sally.
1895325 1897625 - Hi, folks!<br />- Good morning!
1898355 1899345 You know her?
1899425 1902395 She's the town attorney and my fianc�e.
1902465 1903455 What?
1903535 1907625 Nah, I'm just kiddin'.<br />She just likes me for my body.
1907705 1911535 You look great. You do something<br />different with your side view mirrors?
1911605 1913265 What do you want, Sally?
1913345 1916705 Come on, make this guy<br />fix the road. The town needs this.
1916775 1919935 No. I know his type. Racecar.
1920015 1922075 That's the last thing this town needs.
1922145 1926645 OK, I didn't want to have to do this,<br />Doc, but you leave me no choice.
1926725 1930655 Fellow citizens, you're all aware<br />of our town's proud history.
1930725 1932155 Here she goes again.
1932225 1934925 Radiator Springs,<br />the glorious jewel
1934995 1938625 strung on the necklace<br />of Route 66, the mother road!
1938695 1942495 It is our job and our pleasure<br />to take care of the travelers
1942565 1945565 - on our stretch of that road.<br />- Travelers? What travelers?
1945635 1946795 Ignore him.
1946875 1950245 But how, I ask you,<br />are we to care for those travelers
1950315 1952645 if there is no road<br />for them to drive on?
1952715 1955515 - Luigi, what do you have at your store?<br />- Tires.
1955585 1957075 And if no one can get to you?
1957155 1961485 I won't sell any... tires.<br />I will lose everything!
1961555 1964385 - Flo, what do you have at your store?<br />- I have gas.
1964455 1967855 - Lotsa gas!<br />- OK boys, stay with me.
1967925 1971455 And, Flo, what'll happen if no one<br />can come to your station to buy gas?
1971535 1975025 I'll go outta business and...<br />we'll have to leave town.
1975105 1978225 What's gonna happen if Flo<br />leaves town and closes her station?
1978305 1980865 - Without gas, we're done for!<br />- What?
1980945 1983775 Don't you think the car responsible<br />should fix our road?
1983845 1987075 The only guy strong enough<br />to fix that road is Big Al!
1987145 1989375 Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.
1989445 1991475 Then why are you bringing<br />him up, you lemon?
1991555 1992545 Oh, he can do it.
1992615 1995415 He's got the horsepower.<br />So, what do you want him to do?
1995485 1996955 Fix the road!
1997025 2000585 - Because we are a town worth fixing!<br />- Yeah!
2001995 2005195 Order in the court!
2005965 2008735 Seems like my mind<br />has been changed for me.
2008805 2010795 - Yeah!<br />- No!
2010875 2012205 Nice ruling.
2012935 2016435 Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.
2016505 2020375 That's OK, Stickers.<br />You can take Bessie.
2020585 2022275 Man, you get to work with Bessie!
2022345 2024975 I'd give my left two lug nuts<br />for somethin' like that.
2025055 2027715 Bessie? Who's Bessie?
2029925 2033885 This here is Bessie,<br />finest road-pavin' machine ever built.
2033965 2037025 I'm hereby sentencing you<br />to community service.
2037095 2039825 You're gonna fix the road<br />under my supervision.
2039895 2042235 What? This place is crazy!
2042305 2044465 I know this may be<br />a bad time right now,
2044535 2047525 but you owe me $32,000<br />in legal fees.
2047605 2048595 What?
2048675 2052235 We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,<br />and you're gonna pull her nice.
2052315 2053905 You gotta be kidding me.
2053985 2056645 You start there where the road begins.
2057015 2060005 You finish down there<br />where the road ends.
2061985 2064255 Holy shoot!
2064795 2067195 Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br />How long is this gonna take?
2067265 2070825 Well, fella does it right,<br />should take him about five days.
2070895 2072055 Five days?
2072135 2075065 But I should be in California<br />schmoozing Dinoco right now!
2075135 2078105 Then if I were you,<br />I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!
2078175 2080665 - Hook him up, Mater.<br />- Okay-dokey.
2088745 2090975 Freedom!
2096285 2099815 Maybe I should've<br />hooked him up to Bessie...
2100595 2103895 ...and then...<br />then took the boot off.
2105365 2107765 Whoo-hoo!
2108505 2112495 Goodbye, Radiator Springs,<br />and goodbye, Bessie!
2112575 2116445 California, here I come! Yeah!
2118815 2120805 Oh, feel that wind.
2121245 2122835 Yes!
2124015 2126045 No. No, no, no.
2126355 2128655 No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?
2128725 2130715 How can I be outta gas?
2130795 2134745 Boy, we ain't<br />as dumb as you think we are.
2134825 2137165 But how did,<br />how did... you...?
2137235 2139565 We siphoned your gas<br />while you were passed out.
2139635 2142535 - Ka-chow.<br />- Ow, ow, ow, ow.
2150945 2153345 - Gentlemen.<br />- Sheriff.
2153415 2154505 Hey, Sheriff.
2154585 2156845 <i>- Why here?<br />- Sono sempre stati qui.</i>
2156915 2159405 <i>- They were better before.<br />- Stai sempre a parlare.</i>
2159485 2161355 - Guido!<br />- Red, can you move over?
2161425 2164255 I want to get a look<br />at that sexy hot rod.
2164325 2167155 You know, I used to be<br />a purty good whistler.
2167225 2169955 I can't do it now, of course,<br />on account of sometimes
2170025 2172935 I get fluid built up<br />in my engine block,
2172995 2176365 but Doc said he's gonna fix it.<br />He can fix about anything.
2176435 2178665 That's why we made him the judge.
2178835 2183005 <i>Boy, you shoulda heard me on<br />Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.</i>
2183075 2184445 Now, I'm not one to brag
2184515 2187815 but people come purty far<br />to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".
2188285 2189305 Oh!
2189385 2192215 - Aw, man, that's just great!<br />- Hey, what's wrong?
2192285 2194085 My lucky sticker's all dirty.
2194155 2196415 Ah, that ain't nothin'.<br />I'll clean it for ya.
2196485 2201185 No, no, no!
2201265 2203595 That won't be necessary.
2204665 2207965 Hey! Hey, big fella!<br />Yeah, you in the red!
2208035 2210665 I could use a little hose down.<br />Help me wash this off.
2213105 2214095 Where's he goin'?
2214175 2217615 Oh, he's a little bit shy, and<br />he hates you for killin' his flowers.
2217675 2219205 I shouldn't put up with this.
2219275 2222145 I'm a precision instrument<br />of speed and aerodynamics.
2222215 2225245 - You hurt your what?<br />- I'm a very famous racecar!
2225515 2228715 You are a famous racecar?<br />A real racecar?
2228785 2231415 Yes, I'm a real racecar.<br />What do you think? Look at me.
2231495 2235485 I have followed racing my entire life.<br />My whole life!
2235565 2237865 Then you know who I am.<br />I'm Lightning McQueen.
2237935 2240025 - Lightning McQueen?<br />- Yes! Yes!
2240095 2242095 I must scream it to the world!
2242165 2246405 My excitement from the top<br />of someplace very high!
2246475 2248965 - Do you know many Ferraris?<br />- No, no, no, no, no.
2249045 2252015 They race on the European circuit.<br />I'm in the Piston Cup!
2252775 2255715 - What?<br />- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.
2260585 2263145 Is that what I think it is?
2264725 2265985 Customers.
2266055 2269515 Customers!<br />Customers, everyone! Customers!
2269595 2270965 - OK!<br />- Customers?
2271035 2273865 Been a long time.<br />Remember what we rehearsed.
2273935 2276495 Make sure your<br />"Open, please come in" signs are out.
2276565 2280095 You all know what to do.<br />All right, nobody panics. Here we go!
2280175 2282835 Van, I just don't see<br />any on-ramp anywhere.
2282905 2287315 - Minny, I know exactly where we are.<br />- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.
2287385 2290045 - Honey, please.<br />- Hello.
2290115 2293085 Welcome to Radiator Springs,<br />gateway to Ornament Valley.
2293155 2295415 Legendary for<br />its service and hospitality.
2295485 2296515 How can we help you?
2296585 2300655 - We don't need anything, thank you.<br />- Ask for directions to the Interstate.
2300725 2303955 There's no need to ask for directions.<br />I know where we're going.
2304035 2306465 He did the same thing<br />on our trip to Shakopee.
2306535 2309365 We were headed over there<br />for the Crazy Days, and we...
2309435 2312495 - OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?<br />- What you really need
2312575 2316635 is the sweet taste<br />of my homemade, organic fuel.
2316705 2318405 No, it doesn't agree with my tank.
2318475 2321675 - Just trying to find the Interstate.<br />- Good to see you, soldier!
2321745 2325085 Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut<br />for your government surplus needs.
2325155 2327485 - Honey, surplus!<br />- We have too much surplus.
2327555 2329885 I do have a map<br />over at the Cozy Cone Motel.
2329955 2333115 And if you stay, we offer a free<br />Lincoln Continental breakfast.
2333195 2336925 - Honey, she's got a map.<br />- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.
2336995 2340455 - Never need a map again, thank you.<br />- How 'bout somethin' to drink?
2340535 2344465 Stop at Flo's V-Eight Caf�.<br />Finest fuel on Route 66.
2344535 2345695 No we just topped off.
2345775 2349645 And if you need tires,<br />stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,
2349705 2352175 home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.
2352245 2355575 - We're trying to find the Interstate.<br />- But you do need a paint job.
2355645 2358815 Ramone will paint you up right.<br />Hey, anything you want!
2358885 2361185 - You know, like a flame job.<br />- No thanks...
2361255 2362585 Maybe ghost flames!
2362655 2365215 You like old school pinstripin'?<br />Von Dutch style?
2365295 2369195 Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.
2369265 2372285 OK, no.<br />We're gonna be going now, OK?
2372365 2373855 Ow!

2377375 2379465 - OK!<br />- Come back soon, OK?
2379535 2383035 I mean, you know where we are!<br />Tell your friends!
2384645 2386705 OK! Yes. You bet.
2386775 2389045 Thanks again, folks.<br />Bye-bye now.
2389115 2392205 Psst! Psst!<br />Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
2392285 2394445 - I know how to get to the Interstate!<br />- Do ya?
2394525 2397185 - Minny, no.<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2397255 2398725 No, not really. But listen.
2398795 2402425 I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.<br />I'm being held against my will.
2402495 2405025 I need you to call my team,<br />so they can come rescue me
2405095 2408935 and get me to California in time for me<br />to win the Piston Cup. Understand?
2409905 2412165 <i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>
2412235 2416105 No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!<br />You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!
2416175 2419335 I'm in hillbilly hell!<br />My IQ's dropping by the second!
2419415 2421505 I'm becoming one of them!
2423385 2425515 OK, don't worry.<br />They know where we are now.
2425585 2427345 They'll tell friends. You'll see.
2427425 2430285 <i>We'll be back<br />for our Hank Williams marathon...</i>
2430355 2433085 <i>- That's good.<br />...after a Piston Cup update.</i>
2433155 2437065 <i>Still no sign of Lightning<br />McQueen. Chick arrived in California</i>
2437135 2440585 <i>and today became the first car<br />to spend practice time on the track.</i>
2440665 2443835 <i>It's nice to get out here<br />before the other competitors.</i>
2443905 2447665 <i>You know, get a head start.<br />Gives me an edge.</i>
2451115 2452905 Hoo-hoo-hoo!
2457985 2458975 Ha-ha!
2462825 2463815 Yeah!
2475435 2477765 Hey, McQueen...<br />Eat your heart out.
2478235 2480065 Oh!
2480135 2481505 Let me get this straight.
2481575 2484505 I can go when this road is done.<br />That's the deal, right?
2484575 2488305 - That's what they done did said.<br />- OK. Outta my way.
2488385 2489475 I got a road to finish.
2501325 2503725 - He's done!<br />- Done?
2503795 2506165 - Uh-huh.<br />- It's only been an hour.
2508105 2511435 Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.
2511505 2514375 Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.<br />That's all you gotta say.
2514975 2518635 Whee-hoo!<br />I'm the first one on the new road!
2519215 2520805 Oh!
2522145 2524845 It rides purty smooth.
2525085 2528545 - It looks awful!<br />- Well, it matches the rest of the town.
2528655 2532145 Oh!
2532525 2534515 Red.
2537135 2538465 Who do you think you are?
2538535 2541835 Look, Doc said when I finish,<br />I could go. That was the deal.
2541905 2545335 The deal was you fix the road,<br />not make it worse.
2545405 2547875 Now, scrape it off!<br />Start over again.
2547945 2551565 Hey, look, grandpa,<br />I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.
2551645 2553135 Oh-ho-ho-ho!
2553215 2557445 Is that right? Then why don't we<br />just have a little race? Me and you.
2557515 2561315 - What?<br />- Me and you. That a joke?
2561385 2563755 If you win, you go and I fix the road.
2563825 2566515 If I win, you do the road my way.
2566595 2568115 Doc, what're you doin'?
2568495 2570325 I don't mean to be rude here,
2570395 2574125 but you probably go zero to sixty in,<br />like, what? Three-point-five years?
2574205 2576725 Then I reckon<br />you ain't got nothin' to worry about.
2576805 2581465 You know what, old-timer?<br />That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.
2583205 2585735 Gentlemen,<br />this will be a one-lap race.
2585815 2590305 You will drive to Willy's Butte,<br />go around Willy's Butte and come back.
2590385 2593315 There will be no bumpin',<br />no cheatin', no spittin',
2593385 2595915 no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',
2595985 2601115 no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',<br />no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',
2601195 2602955 and no lollygaggin'.
2603025 2604585 Speed. I'm speed.
2604665 2607225 Float like a Cadillac,<br />sting like a Beemer.
2608465 2613265 My friend Guido, he dream to give<br />a real racecar a pit stop.
2613335 2615865 - Peet stop!<br />- Uh...
2615945 2618805 The race is only one lap, guys.
2618875 2621365 <i>Uno lappo! Don't need any help.</i>
2621445 2625285 <i>- I work solo mio.<br />- Fine. Race your way.</i>
2626585 2630455 - No pit stoppo. Comprendo?<br />- OK.
2630555 2632545 Gentlemen...
2633195 2636025 ...start your engines!
2642805 2645165 <i>- Hijole! Check that out!<br />- Whoa.</i>
2645235 2648335 Great idea, Doc.<br />Now the road will never get done.
2648705 2650005 Luigi?
2650075 2653275 On your mark, get set...
2653345 2655575 <i>Uno for the money,<br />due for the show,</i>
2655645 2661345 <i>tre to get ready, and quattro<br />to... I can't believe it. Go!</i>
2669825 2671165 Huh?
2671795 2674325 Doc... the flag means go.
2674405 2677735 Remember the fl...<br />Here we go. Go.
2677805 2680535 Doc, what are you doing, man?
2680605 2684165 Oh, dear. It would seem<br />I'm off to a poor start.
2684245 2687375 Well, better late than never.<br />Come on, Mater.
2687445 2690215 - Might need a little help.<br />- Uh... OK.
2691915 2693355 You got your tow cable?
2693415 2695615 Well, yeah,<br />I always got my tow cable. Why?
2695685 2697985 Oh, just in case.
2706535 2708725 Ow! Ow!<br />Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
2708805 2710535 No, no, no, no, no!
2710675 2713075 - Oh, man!<br />- Whoa.
2713805 2716105 - Ow!<br />- Bad trip, man.
2719275 2725275 Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac<br />or was that stingin' like a Beemer?
2725355 2727715 I'm confused.
2727785 2729885 You drive like you fix roads.
2729955 2733155 Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.
2736965 2738795 Ah!
2739535 2742505 I'm startin' to think he knowed<br />you was gonna crash!
2742565 2745695 Thank you, Mater. Thank you.
2748805 2750745 I can make a little turn on dirt.
2750815 2752245 You think?
2752315 2756775 No. And now I'm a day behind.<br />I'm never gonna get outta here!
2756845 2759315 <i>Hey, �se!<br />You need a new paint job, man!</i>
2759385 2762355 - No, thank you.<br />- How 'bout some organic fuel?
2762425 2764785 - That freak juice?<br />- Pass.
2764855 2769315 Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.<br />Anybody else want somethin' to drink?
2769395 2770985 Nah, not me, Flo.
2771065 2773535 I'm on one of them there special diets.
2773595 2778195 I'm a precisional instrument<br />of speed and aero-matics.
2778775 2781035 "You race like you fix roads."
2781105 2785875 I'll show him.<br />I will show him!
2794225 2798555 Oh, great! I hate it!
2798625 2802255 - Hate, hate, hate, hate it!<br />- Music. Sweet music.
2803465 2806025 Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
2806095 2808825 Radiator Springs, a happy place!
2808905 2811925 OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?
2814475 2818275 Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!<br />I'm talking to Bessie!
2831325 2832385 Wow.
2832725 2834425 Mornin', Sally!
2834495 2839695 Hey, look at this here fancy new road<br />that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!
2839765 2841795 Yes! Uh, amazing!
2842265 2845895 Whoa-ho! Yeah!
2845975 2850165 Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't<br />seen you that low in years.
2850245 2852805 I haven't seen a road like this<br />in years.
2852875 2857005 - Well, then let's cruise, baby.<br />- Low and slow.
2857085 2859275 <i>E bellissima! It's beautiful!</i>
2859355 2863085 Guido, look, it's-a like<br />it was paved by angels.
2864025 2865325 Boy, I tell you what.
2865395 2868225 I bet even the roads on the moon<br />ain't this smooth.
2868295 2869955 Doc, look at this!
2870095 2872965 Shoulda tossed him into<br />the cactus a lot sooner, huh?
2873035 2876525 Well, he ain't finished yet.<br />Still got a long way to go.
2876605 2879575 Guido, look at Luigi!
2880175 2881905 <i>This is fantastico!</i>
2881975 2885435 That looks like fun!<br />Mater, I got dibs, next turn!
2885515 2889815 Hey, Luigi, this new road<br />makes your place look like a dump.
2890485 2893175 That crazy old devil woman.
2893655 2897055 Oh!
2897125 2898955 She's right!
2899025 2900585 - Ah!<br />- Guido!
2900655 2904425 Huh. That punk actually did a good job.
2905695 2909495 Well, now... where the heck is he?
2915845 2918575 Sheriff!<br />Is he makin' another run for it?
2918645 2922015 No, no. He ran outta asphalt<br />in the middle of the night,
2922085 2924445 and asked me if he could<br />come down here.
2924515 2926915 All he's tryin' to do<br />is make that there turn.
2926985 2929815 No, no, no, no! Oh, great.
2930285 2932815 Perfect turns on every track<br />I've ever raced on.
2935025 2938985 Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself<br />a quart of oil at Flo's.
2939065 2940465 I'll keep an eye on him.
2940535 2944435 Well, thanks, Doc.<br />I've been feelin' a quart low.
2958815 2961285 This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.
2961355 2964085 Oh, great. What do you want?<br />You here to gloat?
2964155 2967485 You don't have three-wheel brakes,<br />so you got to pitch it hard,
2967565 2971055 break it loose and then<br />just drive it with the throttle.
2971135 2974195 Give it too much, you'll be<br />outta the dirt and into the tulips.
2974265 2977365 So you're a judge,<br />a doctor and a racing expert.
2977435 2979095 I'll put it simple.
2979175 2983335 If you're goin' hard enough left,<br />you'll find yourself turnin' right.
2984415 2989815 Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.<br />Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!
2989885 2991675 Or should I say, "No, thank you"?
2991755 2995345 Because in Opposite World,<br />maybe that really means, "Thank you"!
2998155 3001555 Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!
3009205 3011135 Turn right to go left.
3012405 3014395 Hmm...
3014475 3015535 Whoa!
3016905 3019345 Oh!
3019815 3023775 Ow! Oh, that...
3025355 3028715 Ow!
3030155 3033425 Turn right to go left.<br />Guess what. I tried it.
3033495 3036585 You know what? This crazy thing<br />happened... I went right!
3036665 3040065 You keep talkin' to yourself,<br />people'll think you're crazy.
3040135 3044065 - Thanks for the tip.<br />- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!
3050945 3054505 <i>- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!<br />- Che cosa?</i>
3054585 3058945 <i>- It looks great! This is great!<br />- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.</i>
3061555 3063545 Oh, Lord.
3063625 3065245 Mater!
3065325 3067485 I need you<br />to watch the prisoner tonight.
3067555 3070855 Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.<br />What if he tries to run again?
3070925 3073765 Just let him run outta gas<br />and tow him on back.
3073835 3076305 - But keep an eye on him.<br />- Yes, sir!
3077405 3079065 Oh...
3079135 3081805 While I'm stuck here<br />paving this stinkin' road,
3081875 3084435 Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.
3084515 3087775 My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br />Who's touching me?
3087845 3090145 You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.
3090215 3092245 You make-a such a nice new road.
3092315 3094985 You come to my shop.<br />Luigi take-a good care of you.
3095055 3096645 Even though you not a Ferrari.
3096725 3100815 You buy four tires,<br />I give you a full-a size spare
3100895 3104765 - absolutely free!<br />- Look, I get all my tires for free.
3104835 3108355 I like your style, eh?
3108435 3111995 You drive the hard bargain.<br />OK. Luigi make you a new deal.
3112075 3115525 You buy one tire,<br />I give you three for free!
3115605 3117265 Oh, would you look at that?
3117345 3119475 Ramone, Ramone!
3119545 3121635 Then Luigi make you<br />a new new deal.
3121715 3124705 No, no, no, no.<br />Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.
3124785 3128415 - No, no, no, no. No.<br />- This is it. My last offer.
3128485 3133185 You buy one tire, I give you<br />seven-a snow tires for free!
3133255 3136125 Done. You interested, you call me.<br />You know where I am.
3137525 3138685 Ah!
3138765 3140895 Stop! Let me...
3142305 3145135 Oh, Red, you missed a spot.<br />See it right there?
3145205 3147225 - No! No!<br />- On the hood right there.
3147305 3150635 Stop, stop! That's cold!
3150705 3153205 Help! Please! Stop!
3153275 3156645 Thanks, Red.
3157885 3159145 What was that for?
3159215 3161345 - Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?<br />- Huh?
3161425 3162915 If you do, you gotta be clean.
3162985 3165515 'Cause even in hillbilly hell<br />we have standards.
3165595 3167325 What, I...? I don't get it.
3167395 3169985 I thought I'd say thank you<br />for doin' a great job.
3170065 3173295 So I thought I'd let you stay with me.<br />I mean, not with me!
3173365 3177995 But there. Not with me there,<br />but there in your own cozy cone.
3178075 3181935 - And I'd be in my cone, and it's...<br />- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.
3182005 3184405 If you want to stay<br />at the dirty impound, fine.
3184475 3187745 - I understand you criminal types.<br />- No, no, no, no. That's OK.
3187815 3191015 - Yeah, the Cozy Cone.<br />- It's newly refurbished.
3191085 3194545 Yeah,<br />it's like a clever little twist.
3194625 3198755 The motel's made out of caution cones,<br />which, of course, cars try to avoid.
3198825 3202195 But now we're gonna stay in them.<br />That's funny.
3203695 3205925 Figure that all out on your own,<br />did you?
3206895 3209365 Cone number one, if you want.
3210465 3212835 Oh...
3213975 3217705 Hey, do I spy a little<br />pinstriping tattoo back there?
3217775 3220875 Oh...<br />That's just a... Oh!
3223445 3226785 Oh, you saw that? Yeah.<br />Just gonna be going.
3226855 3229485 Gonna... Yeah.
3234225 3236825 You know, I knew this girl Doreen.
3236895 3238385 Good-lookin' girl.
3238465 3241765 Looked just like a Jaguar,<br />only she was a truck!
3241835 3245325 You know, I used to crash into her,<br />just so I could spoke to her.
3246435 3248905 - What are you talking about?<br />- I don't know.
3248975 3253105 Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,<br />'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!
3253175 3257345 No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,<br />and I have to get out of here.
3257415 3260975 Well, that's all right,<br />Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.
3261055 3263355 You probably couldn't handle it anyway.
3263425 3265185 Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.
3265255 3268245 You know who you're talkin' to?<br />This is Lightning McQueen.
3268325 3270655 I can handle anything.
3270725 3275565 - I'm not doin' this.<br />- Come on. You'll love it!
3275835 3279365 - Tractor-tippin's fun.<br />- This is ridiculous.
3279435 3281875 All right, listen.
3281945 3285935 When I say go, we go.<br />But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

3494135 3495125 Oh...
3495205 3500475 - Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?<br />- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?
3500545 3504815 Besides, she can't stand me.<br />And I don't like her, to be honest.
3504885 3508785 Yeah, you probably right.<br />Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!
3508855 3511585 Where, where?
3511655 3514255 - You're in love with Miss Sally.<br />- No, I'm not.
3514325 3516485 - Yes, you do.<br />- No way.
3516565 3517755 - Way.<br />- Come on, look...

3527675 3529665 - Will you stop that?<br />- Stop what?
3529745 3533045 Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.<br />You're gonna wreck.
3533115 3538015 Wreck? Shoot!<br />I'm the world's best backwards driver!
3538085 3541215 You just watch this right here,<br />lover boy. Wee-hee!

3580595 3582325 Just need to know where I've been.
3582395 3585525 Whoa, that was incredible!<br />How'd you do that?
3585595 3589595 Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some,<br />and I'll teach you if you want.
3589665 3592895 Yeah,<br />maybe I'll use it in my big race.
3592975 3596495 What's so important<br />about this race of yours, anyway?
3598005 3601745 It's not just a race.<br />We're talking about the Piston Cup!
3601815 3604145 I've been dreaming about it<br />my whole life!
3604215 3607245 I'll be the first rookie in history<br />ever to win it.
3607315 3610885 And when I do,<br />we're talkin' big new sponsor,
3610955 3612615 with private helicopters.
3612695 3615955 No more medicated bumper ointment.<br />No more rusty old cars.
3616025 3618155 What's wrong with rusty old cars?
3619965 3623595 Well, I don't mean you, Mater.<br />I mean other old cars. You know?
3623665 3626835 - Not like you. I like you.<br />- It's OK, buddy.
3627175 3631875 Hey, you think maybe one day I can<br />get a ride in one of them helicopters?
3631945 3636535 I mean, I've always wanted to ride<br />in one of them fancy helicopters.
3636615 3639415 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.<br />- You mean it?
3639485 3641245 Oh, yeah. Anything you say.
3641485 3645285 I knew it. I knowed<br />I made a good choice!
3645355 3647185 In what?

3694135 3696865 When? Just now?<br />What, what did, what did you hear?
3696945 3698935 Something about a helicopter ride.
3699415 3702175 Oh, yeah. Yeah, he got<br />a kick out of that, didn't he?
3702245 3704145 - Did you mean it?<br />- What?

3711485 3714685 You know... Mater trusts you.
3716065 3718425 Yeah, OK.
3718495 3721195 - Did you mean that?<br />- What?
3721265 3726895 Was it just a "Yeah, OK",<br />or "Yeah... OK" or "Yeah, o-OK"?
3726975 3729635 Look, I'm exhausted.<br />It's kinda been a long day.
3730375 3733205 Yeah, OK. G'night.
3735645 3736805 Oh...
3736885 3739075 Hey, thank you.
3741385 3743045 What did you just say?
3743755 3745955 You know,<br />thanks for lettin' me stay here.
3746025 3749895 It's nice to be out of the impound,<br />and this is... It's great.
3749965 3753525 - Newly refurbished, right?<br />- Yeah.
3754435 3756955 - G'night.<br />- Good night.
3761175 3762665 Hmm.
3778155 3781175 Will you turn<br />that disrespectful junk off?
3781255 3785085 Respect the classics, man.<br />It's Hendrix!
3796105 3797595 Ah!
3804015 3805135 No!
3811315 3814615 No!
3814985 3816425 I gotta get outta here!
3816895 3819825 Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?<br />Oh! Oh, my gosh.
3819895 3823155 - Hey, what are you doin'?<br />- Get a good peek, city boy?
3823235 3826725 I just need my<br />daily gas ration from the Sheriff.
3826805 3828925 Wait for him at Flo's.<br />Get outta here.
3829005 3831665 I've been trying<br />to get outta here for three days!
3831735 3834235 Hope you enjoyed the show!
3847825 3849615 Whoa, Doc.
3849695 3853425 Time to clean out the garage, buddy,<br />come on.
3869275 3871105 What?
3872215 3875015 He has a Piston Cup?
3882085 3883855 Oh, my gosh.
3885225 3887255 Three Piston Cups?
3899575 3901565 Sign says stay out.
3902415 3905005 You have three Piston Cups.<br />How could you have...
3905075 3908175 I knew you couldn't drive.<br />I didn't know you couldn't read.
3908245 3911275 - You're the Hudson Hornet!<br />- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!
3911355 3913875 Of course. I can't believe<br />I didn't see it before.
3913955 3915685 You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
3915755 3919415 You used to hold the record for most<br />wins in a season. Oh, we gotta talk.
3919495 3922225 - You gotta show me your tricks. Please.<br />- I tried that.
3922295 3925025 You won three times!<br />Look at those trophies!
3925095 3928535 You look.<br />All I see is a bunch of empty cups.
3933775 3939075 You know, some automotive yoga<br />could really lower your RPM's, man.
3939145 3940945 Oh, take a car wash, hippie.
3941015 3944245 Yeah, look at my husband, y'all!<br />Whoo! That's your color!
3944315 3948045 - Yellow, baby.<br />- Mmm. You smokin' hot!
3948125 3949185 There he is.
3949255 3952245 Oh, my gosh!<br />Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?
3955495 3958265 - Doc? Our Doc?<br />- Not Doc Hudson.
3958335 3960925 No, no, no, no, it's true!<br />He's a real racing legend.
3961005 3963265 He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
3963335 3966635 Fabulous? I never seen Doc<br />drive more than 20 miles an hour.
3966705 3968765 I mean, have you ever seen him race?
3968845 3972435 No, but I wish I could have.<br />They say he was amazing!
3972515 3976385 - He won three Piston Cups!<br />- He did what in his cup?
3976455 3978785 I think the heat's<br />startin' to get to the boy!
3978855 3980985 Well, I'll say! Look how red he is.
3981055 3983455 I think he needs<br />a new coat of poly, man.
3983525 3986285 - Are you sick, buddy?<br />- You are lookin' peaked.
3986365 3988125 He needs a new coat of poly for sure!
3990435 3993955 - Hey! What are you doin'?<br />- It's OK. You can trust me, right?
3994035 3996735 I trust you, all right.<br />It's him I'm worried about.
3997675 4000005 Hmm... I trust him.
4000975 4003275 - Come on, let's take a drive.<br />- A drive?
4003345 4004645 Yeah, a drive.
4004715 4007845 Don't you big city racecars<br />ever just take a drive?
4007915 4010615 Ah... No. No, we don't.
4033105 4036945 Hey, Stickers! You comin' or what?
4042755 4043945 Mm-hm!
4044015 4047475 - And you thought he was gonna run.<br />- Hey, can you believe it, man?
4047555 4049985 He actually thought<br />Doc was a famous racecar!
4051025 4052995 That's so too much!
4055025 4057495 OK, you got me out here.<br />Where are we goin'?
4057565 4059555 I don't know.
4064435 4066425 Whoa! Yes.
4083255 4084885 Oh! Ah-ha-ha!
4084955 4088625 Bleah!
4152565 4154615 Oh!
4174885 4178615 Wow. What is this place?
4179325 4180685 Wheel Well.
4180755 4184015 Used to be the most popular stop<br />on the mother road.
4188665 4190395 This place?
4194005 4196065 Yeah, imagine.
4197735 4200465 Oh, imagine what<br />it must have been like to stay here.
4202815 4204365 You know, I don't get you.
4204445 4207675 How does a Porsche<br />wind up in a place like this?
4207745 4209945 Well, it's really pretty simple.<br />I was...
4210015 4214185 ...an attorney in LA<br />livin' life in the fast lane, and...
4214255 4217815 Oh, you were, were you?<br />Were you rich?
4217895 4221295 - What?<br />- Just... clues to the puzzle.
4222065 4224695 Yeah, OK.<br />Well, that was my life.
4224765 4226525 And you know what?
4226605 4230225 It never felt... happy.
4231875 4234965 Yeah. I mean... really?
4235045 4236775 Yeah. So I left California.
4236845 4240145 Just drove and drove<br />and finally broke down right here.
4240885 4243675 Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.
4243755 4246745 Well, they all did. And I never left.
4248025 4249715 Yeah. You know, I understand.
4249795 4252625 You need a little R and R.<br />Recharge the old batteries.
4252695 4256425 But you know, after a while,<br />why didn't you go back?
4257395 4260855 I fell in love.
4260935 4264595 - Oh.<br />- Yep.
4265435 4268235 - Corvette?<br />- No.
4273785 4276545 I fell in love with this.
4288565 4292295 Whoa. Look at that.
4293165 4295495 Look, they're drivin' right by.
4295565 4297765 They don't even know<br />what they're missing!
4298775 4301105 Well,<br />it didn't used to be that way.
4302575 4303905 Oh, yeah?
4303975 4307885 Yeah. Forty years ago,<br />that Interstate down there didn't exist.
4309015 4310005 Really?
4310085 4312785 Yeah. Back then,
4312855 4315725 cars came across the country<br />a whole different way.
4316995 4318325 How do you mean?
4318395 4321795 The road didn't cut through the land<br />like that Interstate.
4321865 4326065 It moved with the land, you know?<br />It rose, it fell, it curved.
4327565 4329555 - Mornin'!<br />- Nice day, huh?
4331475 4334275 Cars didn't drive on it<br />to make great time.
4334345 4336905 They drove on it to have a great time.
4370915 4373315 Well, what happened?
4373385 4376835 The town got bypassed<br />just to save ten minutes of driving.
4463005 4466595 How great would it have been<br />to see this place in its heyday!
4466675 4469475 Oh, I can't tell you how many times<br />I've dreamed of that.
4469545 4473205 But one of these days we'll<br />find a way to get it back on the map.
4473285 4476945 Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.
4477015 4478845 I had a great time.
4478915 4481645 It's kinda nice to slow down<br />every once in a while.
4482285 4484455 You're welcome.
4491835 4493095 Hey, listen, listen!
4493165 4496265 If anybody asks you,<br />we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?
4496335 4498425 Wha... what?
4513755 4515815 Oh, man, the paint's still wet!
4526435 4528295 No, no, no, no!<br />Get out of the store!
4528365 4531965 Hey! Don't eat the radial!<br />Here, take-a the snow tires.
4532035 4534335 - Mater!<br />- I wasn't tractor-tippin'!
4534405 4537435 Then where did all these<br />gol-durn tractors come from?
4537675 4540015 - Whoa, boy!<br />- Hey! Hey, guys!
4540085 4542045 There's one goin' this way.
4543015 4545215 I got it.
4548725 4551025 Come here, little tractor,<br />come here.
4551095 4553355 Yeah, that's a good tractor.
4553425 4554795 No, no, no, no, come here.
4554865 4556225 What are you doing?
4556295 4558995 You're not supposed to go<br />wandering off all...
4559295 4561665 ...alone.
4572045 4576275 What are you doin'<br />with those old racin' tires?
4582955 4585255 Come on, Doc, drive.
4663135 4664935 Ah... Yeah.
4665005 4666665 - Wow.<br />- Huh?
4666745 4668335 You're amazing!
4670315 4672575 What are you doin'?
4672645 4674345 Doc, wait!
4678215 4680655 Giddup right in there!<br />Come on, Rusty.
4683555 4686755 Doc, hold it!<br />Seriously, your driving's incredible!
4686825 4690125 - Wonderful. Now, go away.<br />- Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!
4690195 4692025 - I'm askin' you to leave.<br />- Come on.
4692095 4695095 I'm a racecar,<br />you're a much older racecar,
4695165 4697155 but under the hood<br />you and I are the same.
4697235 4700295 We are not the same!<br />Understand? Now, get out.
4700375 4703305 How could a car like you quit<br />at the top of your game?
4705175 4707645 You think I quit?
4720225 4721925 Right.
4722565 4725195 Your big wreck in '54.
4725935 4728235 They quit on me.
4728305 4731865 When I finally got put together,<br />I went back expecting a big welcome.
4731935 4734835 You know what they said?<br />"You're history."
4734905 4737965 Moved right on to<br />the next rookie standing in line.
4740815 4743045 There was a lot left in me.
4743785 4746775 I never got a chance to show 'em.
4748285 4752315 I keep that to remind me<br />never to go back.
4753495 4756655 I just never expected that<br />that world would...
4756735 4758925 ...would find me here.
4760035 4762625 - Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them.<br />- Oh, yeah?
4762705 4763695 No, I'm not.
4763775 4767605 When is the last time you cared about<br />something except yourself, hot rod?
4767675 4772275 You name me one time<br />and I will take it all back.
4774115 4777105 Uh-huh. I didn't think so.
4777515 4781285 These are good folk around here,<br />who care about one another.
4781925 4785055 I don't want 'em depending<br />on someone they can't count on.
4785625 4787655 Oh, like you?<br />You've been here how long
4787725 4789955 and your friends<br />don't even know who you are?
4790635 4792685 Who's caring about only himself?
4792765 4795565 Just finish that road<br />and get outta here!
4809715 4812415 Will you turn that<br />disrespectful junk off?
4812485 4814925 Respect the classics, man.
4824665 4827465 Ah...
4841385 4842745 He's done.
4842815 4846045 He must've finished it<br />while we was all sleepin'.
4846115 4848345 Good riddance.
4856225 4857665 He's gone?
4857735 4860755 Well, we wouldn't want him<br />to miss that race of his.
4866205 4870545 - Oh, dude, are you crying?<br />- No! I'm happy!
4870615 4873575 I don't have to watch him<br />every second of the day anymore!
4873645 4874845 I'm glad he's gone!
4881455 4883255 What's wrong with Red?
4883325 4886725 Oh, he's just sad<br />'cause you left town
4886795 4889725 and went to your big race to win<br />the Piston Cup
4889795 4892665 that you've always dreamed about<br />your whole life
4892735 4898265 and get that big ol' sponsor and that<br />fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.
4902905 4905205 Wait a minute!
4906615 4909445 I knowed you wouldn't leave<br />without saying goodbye.
4909515 4912245 What are you doin' here?<br />You're gonna miss your race.
4912315 4915985 Don't worry. I'll give you<br />a police escort, and we'll make up time.
4916055 4917215 Thank you, Sheriff.
4917295 4919415 But you know I can't go just yet.
4919495 4920985 Well, why not?
4921065 4923895 I'm not sure these tires...
4923965 4926865 ...can get me to California.<br />- Peet stop?
4926935 4930195 Yeah, does anybody know<br />what time Luigi's opens?
4930275 4931605 I can't-a believe it!<br />Four new tires!
4931645 4933435 I can't-a believe it!<br />Four new tires!
4933645 4936235 <i>Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!</i>
4936305 4940405 - Would you look at that!<br />- Our first customer in years!
4940485 4944075 I am filled with tears of ecstasy,
4944155 4948015 for this is the most glorious day<br />of my life!
4948085 4952085 All right, Luigi, give me<br />the best set of blackwalls you've got.
4952295 4953525 No! No, no, no.
4953595 4956965 You don't-a know what you want.<br />Luigi know what you want.
4958095 4962465 Blackwall tires.<br />They blend into the pavement.
4962535 4964005 But-a this...
4964305 4966135 Whitewall tires!
4966205 4971375 They say, "Look at me!<br />Here I am! Love me."
4971445 4973245 All right, you're the expert.
4973315 4976245 Don't forget the spare.
4976315 4979145 <i>- Perfetto. Guido!<br />- Peet stop!</i>
4990535 4993465 What did Luigi tell you, eh?
4993535 4996995 Wow, you were right.<br />Better than a Ferrari, huh?
4997775 4998935 Eh... No.
5002805 5006405 Wow! This organic fuel is great!<br />Why haven't I heard about it before?
5006475 5008475 It's a conspiracy, man!
5008545 5011015 The oil companies got a grip<br />on the government!
5011085 5014315 They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.
5014385 5016515 OK, I'll take a case.
5031575 5033035 Ow! Eh!
5041885 5043505 Ah... Yeah.
5044055 5045575 Ka-chow.
5046455 5049425 - Here she comes!<br />- Places, everybody. Hurry!
5049485 5051215 Act natural.
5051295 5052625 <i>- Hi, Sally.<br />- Buon giorno!</i>
5052695 5054525 All right, what's goin' on?
5054595 5056755 Ladies and gentlecars,
5056835 5060765 please welcome<br />the new Lightning McQueen!
5061405 5063395 Pow! What do you think?
5063475 5065665 Radiator Springs<br />looks pretty good on me.
5065735 5067535 I'll say.
5067605 5070805 Ka-chow.
5070875 5073405 You're gonna fit right in<br />in California.
5074285 5077405 My goodness. It looks like<br />you've helped everybody in town.
5077485 5079315 Yeah, everybody except one.
5080555 5085545 - Hey, is it getting dark out?<br />- What? What'd he say?
5085625 5088655 Let me say that again.<br />Is it getting dark out?
5088725 5090925 Now, what was I<br />supposed to do after that?
5114925 5117715 They fixed their neon!
5125135 5130125 - Low and slow?<br />- Oh, yeah, baby!
5134445 5137775 Just like in its heyday, right?
5137845 5141215 It's even better than I pictured it.<br />Thank you.
5168645 5170075 Shall we cruise?
5170145 5172475 Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!
5172545 5174015 - No, no, no.<br />- Lizzie!
5174085 5178415 I remember when Stanley<br />first asked me to take a drive with him.
5178485 5181355 Hey, Miss Sally.<br />May I have this cruise?
5181425 5184785 - Of course, Mater.<br />- Uh-uh-uh!
5191265 5195635 ...and again and I said, "No."<br />He asked me again, and I said, "No."
5195705 5200035 But, oh, he was a persistent<br />little bugger for a two-cylinder.
5200105 5203505 Finally I said,<br />"All right, one little drive."
5205675 5208675 Oh!
5213015 5215145 - Hey!<br />- Thanks, Mater.
5215225 5217515 Good evenin', you two.
5220025 5225255 Oh, Stanley,<br />I wish you could see this.
5229365 5233165 - Is that what I think it is?<br />- Oh, I don't know, Flo.
5233235 5238905 I haven't had a chance to find out.<br />But I am going to find out. Hello.
5238975 5241575 Not that. That.
5241645 5241715 Customers?
5241745 5244045 Customers?
5244115 5246775 Customers, everybody!<br />And a lot of 'em!
5246855 5249015 You know what to do.<br />Just like we rehearsed.
5250155 5252755 It's the ghostlight!
5252825 5255415 We have found McQueen.<br />We have found McQueen!
5256295 5257765 McQueen, over here!
5257835 5260595 - Wait, excuse me.<br />- Is it true you've been in rehab?
5260665 5262795 - Did you have a nervous breakdown?<br />- What?
5262865 5265595 - McQueen's wearing whitewalls!<br />- Your tires balding?
5265675 5266665 Stickers!
5266735 5268905 - Was McQueen your prisoner?<br />- Shoot, no!
5268975 5271445 We're best buds!<br />I ain't braggin' or nothin',
5271515 5274705 but I was in charge of huntin' him down<br />if he tried to escape.
5274785 5276375 Sally! Sally!
5276445 5278505 Will you still race for the Piston Cup?
5278585 5280315 - Stickers?<br />- Sally!
5280385 5282785 Come on, give us some bolt!
5282855 5287345 You're here!<br />Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!
5287425 5290795 - Mack?<br />- You're here! I can't believe it!
5290865 5294735 You are a sight<br />for sore headlights!
5294805 5297535 I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.<br />I'll make it up to you!
5297605 5299465 Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.
5299535 5302135 <i>Is that the world's<br />fastest racing machine?</i>
5302205 5304735 - Is that Harv?<br />- Yeah. He's in the back.

5386195 5389055 Thank you. Thanks for everything.
5391235 5396425 - It was just a road.<br />- No. It was much more than that.
5399575 5402765 Hey, kid! We gotta go.<br />Harv's goin' crazy!
5402845 5406075 He's gonna have me fired if<br />I don't get you in the truck right now!

5458095 5460495 - Yeah.<br />- Thanks for the call.
5468975 5472705 - You called them?<br />- It's best for everyone, Sally.
5473345 5476475 Best for everyone or best for you?
5492965 5495765 I didn't get to say goodbye to him.
5555325 5558665 Hello, race fans. Welcome<br />to what has become, quite simply,
5558735 5561025 the biggest event<br />in the history of racing.
5561105 5563335 A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!
5563405 5565875 There's a crowd<br />of nearly 200,000 cars
5565935 5568495 here at the Los Angeles<br />International Speedway.
5568575 5572905 Tickets to this race are hotter than a<br />black leather seat on a hot summer day!
5572975 5575535 The King, Chick Hicks<br />and Lightning McQueen
5575615 5578945 in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,<br />tiebreaker race.
5579015 5582245 I got a lotta miles on me,<br />but let me tell you somethin'.
5582325 5586315 I never thought I'd see anything<br />like this. This is exciting!
5586395 5588725 In fact, the country<br />has almost shut down
5588795 5592895 to watch what many experts<br />are calling "the race of the century."
5592965 5595595 Hey, King!<br />Good luck in your last race.
5595665 5599765 - You've sure been an inspiration to me.<br />- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.
5599835 5602935 - Hey, be careful out there, OK?<br />- Yeah, man.
5603005 5603995 He's hot!
5604075 5606735 Wanna know the forecast?<br />I'll give you the forecast.
5606815 5609905 A 100 percent chance of thunder!<br />Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
5609985 5612505 Say it with me!<br />Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
5612585 5615525 Hey, you! No admittance<br />without a garage pass.
5615585 5618355 Oh, it's OK.<br />Lightning McQueen knows me!
5618425 5621555 Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day<br />for a race, isn't it?
5621625 5626585 - Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.<br />- And good morning to you, Fred.
5626665 5630565 Mario Andretti knows my name!<br />You gotta let me in now!
5630635 5631895 Sorry, pal.
5631975 5636235 OK, here we go.<br />Focus. Speed.
5637005 5639805 I am speed.
5641545 5642745 Victory.
5642815 5644945 One winner, two losers.
5647055 5652585 Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...
5657765 5659355 Lightnin'! You ready?
5659435 5662125 Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.
5675485 5678315 Mack, thanks for being<br />my pit crew today.
5678385 5680975 Don't worry about it, kid.<br />It's the least I could do.
5681055 5683455 After all, "Gas Can"<br />is my middle name.
5683525 5685885 - It is?<br />- Ah... Not really.
5703175 5704575 Uh-oh
5715455 5718425 Nelson! Zoom in.<br />Ready, 16? Take 16.
5718595 5720825 And there he is,<br />Lightning McQueen!
5720895 5724025 Missing all week, and then he turns up<br />in the middle of nowhere!
5724095 5726495 In a little town<br />called Radiator Springs.
5726565 5729625 Wearin' whitewall tires,<br />of all things.
5730775 5733895 - Oh!<br />- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
5735205 5737535 Hey, where you been?<br />I've been kinda lonely.
5737615 5740515 Nobody to hang out with.<br />I mean, except the Dinoco folks.
5740575 5743575 And the twins. Of course.<br />The ones that used to be your fans,
5743645 5746815 but now they're my fans.<br />Listen to what the twins think...
5753655 5755715 Agh! Shoot!
5755795 5758925 Boogity, boogity, boogity,<br />boys! Let's go racin'!
5765205 5766765 Come on, you can do it!
5766835 5768865 Come on, King, make us proud, boy!
5770075 5773275 Fifty laps down, and The King<br />is still holding a slim lead.
5773345 5776575 McQueen's got a run on him!<br />He's lookin' to the inside!
5778755 5780915 Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!
5780985 5783385 Chick's not<br />making it easy on him today.
5783455 5785185 He lost momentum,
5785255 5787555 and now he's gonna have to<br />chase him back down!
5796965 5799025 McQueen spins out in the infield!
5803005 5805605 Just me<br />and the old man, fellas.
5805675 5809205 McQueen just doesn't have it today.
5810385 5814445 - Hey, kid, are you all right?<br />- I don't know, Mack.
5814525 5815955 I don't think I...
5816025 5818755 I didn't come all this way<br />to see you quit.
5818995 5820515 Doc?
5823195 5825825 Guys, you're here!<br />I can't believe this!
5825895 5829665 I knew you needed a crew chief,<br />but I didn't know it was this bad.
5829735 5831635 You said you'd never come back.
5831705 5835295 Well, I really didn't have a choice.<br />Mater didn't get to say goodbye.
5835375 5838275 Goodbye! OK, I'm good.
5842245 5845745 All right, if you can drive as good<br />as you can fix a road
5845815 5849085 then you can win this race<br />with your eyes shut.
5849155 5851145 Now, get back out there!
5853395 5856365 Hot snot, we are back in business!<br />Guido! Luigi!
5856425 5858725 You're goin' up<br />against professional pit crews.
5858795 5861965 - You're gonna have to be fast.<br />- They will not know what bit them!
5862035 5863725 Kid, you can beat these guys.
5863805 5867205 Find a groove that works for you<br />and get that lap back.
5878915 5880815 - Is it?<br />- Oh, wow. That's him!
5880885 5884655 Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet!<br />The Hudson Hornet's back!
5884725 5887355 It appears McQueen<br />has got himself a pit crew.
5887425 5889825 And look who he has for a crew chief!
5889895 5892595 - Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!<br />- Whoa!
5892665 5895995 Well, dip me in axle grease<br />and call me Slick! It surely is.
5900635 5902665 <i>Wow, this is history<br />in the making.</i>
5902745 5905645 <i>Nobody has seen the racing legend<br />in over 50 years!</i>
5905715 5907115 Hey, Doc!
5907175 5911345 Come look at this fellow on the radio.<br />He looks just like you.
5916255 5920055 - McQueen passes on the inside!<br />- He's nearly a lap down.
5920125 5923025 Can he catch up to them<br />with only 60 laps to go?
5923095 5925995 You're goin' great, kid.<br />Just keep your head on.
5926065 5927655 <i>Vai! Vai, vai!</i>
5927735 5930635 Hey, shrimpie,<br />where did McQueen find you, huh?
5930705 5934135 Those round things are called tires,<br />and they go under the car!
5935305 5937905 <i>Con chi credi di parlare?<br />Ma, con chi stai parlando?</i>
5937975 5941145 No! No, no! You'll have your chance.<br />You will have your chance.
5955595 5958395 Oh, kid's just tryin'<br />to be a hero, huh?
5959965 5961225 What do you think of this?
5961305 5963465 Yeah, that's it, kid.
5966775 5968065 What?
5968145 5969935 Whoa! Git-R-done!
5971715 5975975 - I taught him that. Ka-chow!<br />- Ah!
5976045 5979015 What a move by McQueen!<br />He's caught up to the leaders.
5979085 5980915 Yeah. This is what it's all about.
5980985 5984145 A three-way battle for the lead,<br />with ten to go!
5987795 5990995 Look at that boy go out there!
5996705 5999005 Oh!
5999935 6001495 No, you don't.
6004575 6006565 Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!
6006645 6010085 - Can you get back to the pits?<br />- Yeah, yeah. I think so.
6010145 6013445 Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.<br />Don't tear yourself up, kid.
6015385 6017515 We gotta get him<br />back out there fast
6017585 6020525 or we're gonna be a lap down,<br />and we'll never win this race!
6020595 6022755 Guido! It's time.
6027035 6030125 Hey, tiny,<br />you gonna clean his windshield?
6039245 6040675 I don't believe it!
6040745 6042445 That was<br />the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!
6042515 6045075 It was a great stop,<br />but he's still gotta beat that pace car!
6045155 6046845 It's gonna be close.
6048525 6050985 Yeah, baby!
6051055 6052425 <i>He's back in!</i>
6053755 6054745 Peet stop.
6056195 6058125 - Guido, you did it!<br />- Way to go, Guido!
6073415 6076475 This is it. We're heading into<br />the final lap and McQueen
6076545 6078915 is right behind the leaders.<br />What a comeback!
6078985 6082515 A hundred and ninety-nine<br />laps! It all comes down to this!
6082585 6083855 This is it, kiddo.
6083925 6086415 You've got four turns left.<br />One at a time.
6086495 6088925 Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.
6088995 6090395 Go!
6093095 6094225 We'll see about that!
6095735 6097295 McQueen's going inside!
6100275 6103295 - Chick and King are loose!<br />- I think McQueen's out!
6113985 6116455 - McQueen saved it!<br />- He's back on the track!
6116855 6119515 - Float like a Cadillac...<br />- Sting like a Beemer!
6120595 6124225 Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...
6125795 6128795 Lightning McQueen<br />is gonna win the Piston Cup!
6128865 6130965 Come on! You got it!<br />You got it, Stickers!
6132475 6136275 I am not comin' in<br />behind you again, old man.
6146615 6148515 Oh, no!
6167035 6169235 Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
6169305 6173035 I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!
6174345 6176475 What's he up to, Doc?
6186855 6188225 What are you doin', kid?
6188295 6191525 I think The King<br />should finish his last race.
6194705 6197695 You just gave up the Piston Cup,<br />you know that?
6197765 6201365 This grumpy old racecar I know<br />once told me somethin'.
6201445 6203495 It's just an empty cup.
6205615 6208175 Darrell, is pushing<br />on the last lap legal?
6208245 6211915 He's not really pushin' him. He's<br />just givin' him a little bump draft.
6211985 6214285 Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
6214355 6217045 Hey. What? What's goin' on?
6217125 6219385 That's what I call racin'.
6235345 6238405 <i>- Bravo il mio amico!<br />- Way to go, buddy!</i>
6238475 6241075 There's a lotta love out there,<br />you know, man?
6241145 6245675 - Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.<br />- That's my hot rod.
6247715 6251155 Come on, baby, bring it out!<br />Bring out the Piston Cup!
6251225 6252625 Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!
6252695 6255665 Yeah!<br />Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!
6255725 6258855 Hey, how come the only one celebrating<br />is me, huh?
6258935 6261165 Where are the girls?<br />Bring on the confetti!
6261235 6264825 Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.<br />What's goin' on?
6264905 6268205 Come on, snap some pictures.<br />I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!
6268275 6269745 Say it with me. Ka-chicka!
6269905 6271435 - Boo!<br />- Boo!
6271515 6274605 What's wrong with everybody?<br />Where's the happiness?
6274685 6276775 Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!
6282685 6285175 - Thanks, Lightnin'.<br />- You're welcome.
6287595 6290025 - Way to go, King!<br />- You're still the car!
6290095 6292085 You're The King! Yeah!
6302505 6305965 - You made us proud, kid!<br />- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!
6309185 6311805 You got a lotta stuff, kid.
6312015 6313675 Thanks, Doc.
6314825 6316155 Hey, Lightnin'.
6316225 6318885 How 'bout comin' over here<br />and talk to me a minute?
6319795 6322815 Son, that was some<br />real racin' out there.
6322895 6325655 How'd you like to become<br />the new face of Dinoco?
6330365 6331835 But I didn't win.
6331905 6335565 Lightnin', there's a whole lot<br />more to racin' than just winnin'.
6335645 6338335 He was so rusty,<br />when he drove down the street
6338415 6342575 buzzards used to circle the car!
6342645 6344375 Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...
6344445 6348185 ...but these Rust-eze guys over there<br />gave me my big break.
6349725 6351455 I'm gonna stick with them.
6351525 6354585 Well, I sure can respect that.
6354665 6355825 Still, you know,
6355895 6359765 if there's ever anything<br />I can do for you, just let me know.
6359835 6362355 I sure appreciate that.<br />Thank you.
6363835 6366825 Actually, there is one thing.
6367535 6369765 Whoo-hoo!
6369845 6373705 Hey, look at me!<br />I'm flyin', by golly!
6378215 6381205 I'm happier than a tornado<br />in a trailer park!
6384855 6387155 I think it's about-a time<br />we redecorate.
6390295 6393735 Hi. Lightning McQueen told me<br />this was the best place in the world
6393795 6394785 to get tires.
6394865 6399065 How 'bout setting me and my friends up<br />with three or four sets each?
6399135 6404335 Guido! There is a real<br />Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.
6404405 6406705 A real Ferrari!
6406775 6408905 Punch me, Guido.<br />Punch me in the face.
6408985 6412435 This is the most glorious day<br />of my life.
6413755 6417315 <i>Wow.<br />Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.</i>
6417385 6419725 <i>Mi dicono che siete fantastici.</i>
6436005 6437535 Just passin' through?
6437605 6439905 Actually, I thought I'd stop<br />and stay awhile.
6439975 6443245 - I hear this place is back on the map.<br />- It is?
6443315 6447085 There's some rumor floating around<br />that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar
6447155 6449625 is setting up his big<br />racing headquarters here.
6449685 6452525 Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.
6452595 6455085 You know, I really missed you, Sally.
6455165 6459295 Well, I create feelings in others<br />they themselves don't understand and,
6459365 6461525 blah, blah, blah.
6461935 6464925 <i>McQueen and Sally<br />parked beneath the tree,</i>
6465005 6469635 <i>K- i-s-s... uh... i- n-t!</i>
6470005 6471975 Great timing, Mater!
6472045 6476035 Hep-non, hip-hep, hi-li-lilly! Whee!
6476115 6478545 He's my best friend.<br />What're you gonna do?
6478615 6481555 So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?
6481625 6484315 I don't know.<br />Why don't we just take a drive?
6484385 6486985 Hmm... Nah.
6488725 6490965 Yeah! Ka-chow!
6556025 6560025 Ah-choo!
6562835 6565825 All right, everybody<br />please keep together now.
6565905 6570675 We is now entering the Doc Hudson<br />wing of the museum.
6570745 6573715 Wow. Unbelievable.<br />That many wins in a single season.
6573775 6577835 He's the real deal, Junior.<br />The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.
6577915 6581375 Excuse me, son.<br />Is Doc Hudson here today?
6581455 6585255 Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc<br />went out for a drive or somethin'.
6588595 6591755 - Whoo! Whoo!<br />- Yeah!
6591825 6594355 Well, you sure ain't no dirt boy.
6594435 6597495 Not today, old man.<br />I know all your tricks.
6601775 6603705 Doc! Doc!
6604005 6605475 Whoo-ah!
6605945 6608135 Not all my tricks, rookie!
6624765 6628255 Attention!<br />Kiss the pavement goodbye.
6628335 6631765 When I'm finished, you'll have mud<br />in places you didn't know you had!
6631835 6635675 - Yo, I've never been off-road!<br />- Well, that's gonna change right now!
6635945 6638845 About face!<br />Drop and give me 20 miles!
6638905 6640905 Go! Go!<br />Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

6646455 6648445 Huh? Look at this!
6648515 6650685 It's my hood! It's my hood!
6650755 6653845 I ain't seen this thing in 20 years!
6654455 6658415 Well, it fits perfectly.<br />How do I look? Ah-choo!
6664105 6665365 Oh, dang.
6670545 6674065 <i>You are a toy car!</i>
6674145 6678915 <i>You are a sad, strange little wagon<br />and you have my pity. Farewell.</i>
6679315 6682045 <i>Oh, yeah?<br />Well, good riddance, you loony!</i>
6682115 6685815 <i>Hey, I hate to break up the road rally,<br />guys, but they're here!</i>
6685895 6688255 <i>Birthday guests at three o'clock!</i>
6688325 6691655 Oh, man! Whoever does<br />the voice of that piggy truck,
6691725 6694285 I'm tellin' ya, he's one great actor!
6694835 6699035 <i>We're banished, genius! Stuck here<br />in this wasteland without chains!</i>
6699105 6702865 <i>But, Mike, the Boomobile's in trouble!<br />She needs our help!</i>
6702945 6707205 <i>- You're still not listening!<br />- Ah!</i>
6707275 6710905 <i>Welcome to the Himalayas!<br />Snow cone?</i>
6711215 6714915 Oh, that Abominable Snowplow<br />is quite the comic thespian!
6715455 6717445 <i>Just get in there.<br />Go! Go, go, go!</i>
6717525 6718925 <i>Circus cars?</i>
6718985 6721455 <i>How can you be circus cars?</i>
6721525 6724055 <i>These are the lousiest<br />circus cars in the world,</i>
6724125 6726115 <i>and they're gonna make me rich!</i>
6726195 6727325 Wait a minute here.
6727395 6729865 They're just usin' the same actor<br />over and over.
6729935 6732495 What kind of a cut-rate production<br />is this?
6938345 6943005 Oh, for the love of Chrysler, can we<br />please ask someone for directions?
6943085 6947315 No! There's an on-ramp close!<br />I know it! I can feel it!
