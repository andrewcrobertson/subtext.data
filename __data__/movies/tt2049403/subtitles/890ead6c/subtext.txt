202898 204856 Can they coexist?
205030 207032 That's what<br />we're here to find out.
207207 210688 <i>My name is Lydia Deetz,<br />and welcome to Ghost House.</i>
214779 216390 Joining us in the attic tonight
216564 220045 are Emmet and Jody Welch,<br />from Cleghorn, Wisconsin.
220220 223266 - Along with their dog, Taco.<br />- [Taco whines]
223440 224746 And we're gonna hear about how
224920 228793 their dream home<br />became a ghost house.
230752 233798 I've been a psychic mediator<br />for over 15 years.
233972 235496 But nothing<br />could have prepared me
235670 237367 for what I encountered<br />when I visited
237541 238629 the Welch farm.
240065 241153 - Here's a preview.
242067 243286 Be warned,
243460 244374 it's intense.
246942 249945 <i>I don't know what I'm gonna<br />find behind this door,</i>
250119 253340 <i>but it doesn't want me here.</i>
270922 273142 I feel a dark presence.
273316 275057 - We need to leave! Now!
278495 282238 Emmet, are you ready to hear<br />about your paranormal visitors?
282412 283326 Bring it on.
283500 284980 How about you, Jody?
285154 286590 Haven't slept a wink
286764 289158 since we moved<br />into that darned house.
289332 292466 Taco was so freaked out,<br />he goes to the bathroom
292640 294990 in his doggy bed every night.
295164 297122 It's been a living nightmare.
297297 301475 Confronting the unknown.<br />Conquering your fears.
301649 303433 There's nothing harder.
303607 304826 But don't worry.
305000 306306 I'll be right by your...
309526 310658 What the...
310832 311876 No.
313617 314966 - No, no.<br />- [audience murmuring]
315140 316098 What's going on?
317273 318579 - I don't know.<br />- Go!
318753 320537 No. No.
320711 322496 - Uh...<br />- You're doing great.
322670 324672 I'm...
324846 327239 - Need a break?
327414 329198 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah, let's take a break.
329372 332201 Lydia Deetz,<br />ladies and gentlemen!
332375 333768 - Bravo.
335770 336814 I need five. Make it happen.
337989 339730 Okay, everybody, that's lunch!
350132 352613 I told him<br />he needed to wear contacts.
352787 355659 But no, Mr. Big Shot Magician<br />wouldn't listen.
355833 357400 Oh, can you<br />give it a rest, Nadia?
357574 359315 I'm having a really shitty day.
360664 361796 - Hmm?
363972 365495 What happened out there?
367062 368411 You okay?
368585 370152 Yeah, I'm fine.
370326 372241 It's these double taping days,
372415 374548 - it can get to me.<br />- Oh, God.
374722 376941 Kills me to see you<br />feeling like this.
377115 378508 Because when<br />you're feeling like this,
378682 379553 it just makes me<br />feel what you're feeling.
379727 380989 So in a weird way it's like,
381163 382773 when you're hurting,<br />it's hurting me.
382947 385123 - I don't know.<br />- God, I'm sorry.
385297 386995 I... I don't mean to make you<br />feel like that.
387169 389301 Oh, babe. Hey, it's okay.
389476 391216 If anything, it just shows<br />how connected we are.
393741 395699 It's like we got the same<br />stupid little heart.
405405 407407 No. You don't need these.
407581 408538 Oh.
409713 411454 I have one job, and that is
411628 413500 to make sure that you do not<br />drown your talents
413674 415197 at the bottom<br />of a bottle of pills, Lydia.
415937 417721 Please...
417895 419375 just to get through today.
424032 425250 Okay. But...
425425 426991 this is the last time
427165 428689 that I ever dig pills<br />out of a trash can for you.
428863 431039 Do you understand?<br />Or a toilet or sink.
432606 433563 Here.
436479 438220 Okay? You got this.
438394 439395 - All right?<br />- Yeah.
444008 446141 - Is that mine?<br />- Don't move.
446315 448143 Who's texting me?
448317 449797 Your stupid stepmother.
450928 452321 She's got texting diarrhea.
454497 455411 I have to go.
455585 457152 Lydia...
457326 458980 we still have<br />a segment to finish.
470208 471601 <i>Tell us about</i>
471775 473473 <i>the inspiration<br />for The Human Canvas.</i>
473647 474822 <i>I am my own canvas.</i>
475823 477302 <i>I am my art.</i>
477477 480480 <i>As we know,<br />art imitates the living.</i>
480654 482177 <i>It feeds me.</i>
482351 484614 <i>And I was not getting<br />enough nourishment</i>
484788 486616 <i>from the sculpture alone.</i>
486790 489445 <i>So, I decided<br />to broaden my tastes</i>
489619 491578 <i>and it turns out<br />I am insatiably...</i>
491752 492753 Delia!
492927 494363 Where have you been?
494537 496104 I think I've cried all<br />the water out of my body.
496278 497758 What happened to Dad?
497932 500195 <i>- I'm desolee, Le Tigre!<br /></i>
500369 502589 He is the Picasso<br />of graffiti artists.
502763 504939 He was tagging me like<br />the walls of the Paris Métro.
505113 506897 <i>But now he's having<br />a petite tantrum</i>
507071 508551 because I had to cancel<br />the performance.
508725 510031 What happened?
510771 512207 What? Oh.
514339 515906 Your father's left me.
516080 517342 He's divorcing you?
517517 519736 What a horrible thought.
519910 520998 No! He's dead!
521956 523566 What?
523740 525176 Daddy's passed away.
527788 528919 How?
530530 531705 He was returning
531879 533228 from his bird-watching<br />expedition
533402 534664 to the Funafuti Atoll...
536971 538233 <i>...when his plane<br />went down</i>
538407 539669 <i>in the South Pacific.</i>
544587 545849 A plane crash?
549418 551420 <i>That was<br />his worst nightmare.</i>
553509 554902 Actually,<br />he survived the crash.
555076 557078 - He drowned?<br />- Almost.
557252 559559 But not quite, no.<br />According to survivors,
559733 560777 Daddy clung onto a wing.
562562 563867 - Over here!<br />- Come on!
564041 566174 Hey, swim over!<br />Swim over!
566348 567349 Hey!
568393 570004 So, how did he die?
570178 571701 A shark jumped out of the water
571875 572702 <i>- and got him!<br /></i>
574008 575139 Just like that.
576576 578621 I just spoke to him<br />on Saturday.
578795 580014 He was so excited,
580188 582146 he thanked me<br />for the binoculars,
582320 584453 he said he had observed<br />the mating rituals
584627 586194 of the Tuamotu sandpiper.
586368 588196 Yes, he flew halfway<br />around the world
588370 589763 to watch birds<br />do it on a beach.
589937 590894 And it killed him!
592635 594506 We need to tell Astrid.
595507 597248 Oh. Must we?
597422 598989 She's already<br />such a morbid little thing.
599163 600425 That's if I can even reach her.
600600 602645 We're barely on speaking terms.
602819 603994 Oh, it would kill Charles<br />to know
604168 606431 I had to cancel my show.
606606 607607 <i>[in French]<br />Bonne journée a jamais!</i>
608999 610044 What'd he say?
615484 618356 - [Le Tigre screaming]<br />- [body thuds]
618530 619531 Did you see that?
644339 646167 <i>[in French]<br />Bonjour, monsieur. Ou suis-je?</i>
647298 649344 Where am I?
649518 652913 Down the hall,<br />second door on the right.
653087 654654 Take a number.
654828 656177 Someone will help you.
657352 658832 Eventually.
661661 663575 Goddamn foreigners.

826651 828697 Don't make me tell you twice.
832788 834877 Where is Beetlejuice?
854070 860076 - Ugh.
875657 877746 Ghost House!
877920 878878 When you're all<br />on your third kid
879052 880880 and second divorce,
881054 882272 we'll see who gets<br />the last laugh.
890150 891107 Perfect.
896069 897244 - Leave me alone.
897418 900160 [melancholy music playing]
909560 912781 So it's settled. We'll bring<br />Charles home to Winter River.
912955 914304 But I've never<br />hosted a funeral...
914478 915479 - I've never hosted anything
915653 917177 without Charles standing there.
917351 919092 Watching me. In awe.
919266 920920 <i>It's Astrid.</i>
921094 922399 <i>- Please don't leave a message.<br />- She won't pick up.</i>
922573 924575 Maybe I should tell Astrid<br />about Charles.
925620 926838 Might be easier coming from
927013 928449 a non-feminine<br />masculine archetype.
928623 931147 Well, there aren't any men<br />left in the family.
931321 933584 Well, no offense taken, Delia.
933758 935412 I'll be a member of the family<br />soon enough.
936805 938241 In fact,
938415 939764 I might be the perfect person<br />to tell her.
939939 942071 Having just lost<br />my own grandfather.
942245 944030 You did? When?
944204 945901 Forty years ago.
946075 949296 But in my child body,<br />that's yesterday.
949470 950950 I'm gonna<br />tell Astrid, okay?
951124 952342 Just give me a few minutes<br />before you come up.
952516 954040 Enough!<br />I'll handle this.
956651 957608 Astrid!
959784 960785 Astrid!
961699 962831 Astrid!
964093 966966 Stop torturing your mother.
967140 968968 I know I usually find it funny,
969142 970534 and only fair<br />after the way she treated me
970708 971927 - when she was your age.
972101 973537 But not today!
974799 977324 Your mummy's lost her daddy.
977498 978716 You've lost your grandpa.
979891 981502 And I've lost my...
981676 983025 horny handyman.
984287 985245 Charles.
986159 987638 Charles!
988509 991120 Oh, Charles!
993949 996691 Can't believe Grandpa is dead.
996865 998867 He's like the only semi-normal<br />person in this family.
999041 1001043 We're gonna be in<br />Winter River for a few weeks.
1001217 1002653 What do you mean<br />for a few weeks?
1002827 1004090 I thought we were just<br />going for the funeral.
1004264 1005482 Well, we need to clear out<br />the house.
1005656 1007049 Grandpa loved that place.
1007223 1008659 Yes, and we are going<br />to honor him
1008833 1010705 with a Grief Collective.
1010879 1012663 A "Grief Collective"?
1012837 1017973 I am seeing a semi-multimedia<br />visual manifesto of our loss.
1018147 1019453 What does loss look like?
1019627 1022325 Is it just tears? A headstone?
1022499 1023848 Wilting gladioli?
1024023 1027243 No, we need to unpack<br />the art of sorrow.
1028853 1030986 Yeah, that sounds<br />really traumatic.
1031160 1032118 I can't go.
1032292 1033902 I'm our school rep
1034076 1035686 for our Student Environmental<br />Conference next week.
1035860 1037384 We're presenting our demands<br />on climate change action.
1037558 1039603 I spoke with the principal,<br />and they cleared it.
1039777 1041997 She actually thinks<br />it's a really good idea.
1042171 1043912 Yeah, well, I guess when you<br />donate an entire art center,
1044086 1045696 the principal becomes your<br />little puppet on a string.
1047481 1049091 Well, you're free<br />to reject your inheritance
1049265 1051311 when you're living high<br />off a tree hugger's salary.
1054792 1057230 What? No! No!
1060363 1061408 Jesus! Okay,<br />people already know
1061582 1063192 that Lydia Deetz is my mom.
1063366 1066195 Okay, can you stop being<br />a freak for, like, one second?
1066369 1068719 - Go back.<br />- Why?
1068893 1070330 All right, people already know<br />you'd rather spend
1070504 1072071 more time with ghosts<br />than your own daughter.
1104799 1106757 Jesus, Bob.
1106931 1108585 Can't you see<br />I'm concentrating here?
1109325 1110805 You know, Bob,
1110979 1113199 long distance relationships<br />can be difficult.
1113373 1114939 Especially when<br />one of you is dead
1115114 1116506 and the other's ignoring you<br />for 30 years.
1116680 1117986 But Lydia and I,
1118160 1119901 we have a definite<br />psychic connection.
1120075 1121511 <i>I just need<br />these people out of my house.</i>
1121685 1124253 Please hold! Afterlife<br />Call Center, please hold.
1124427 1126516 <i>How much<br />for a premium bio exorcism?</i>
1126690 1127952 And I'll tell ya something,
1128127 1129650 she definitely saw me<br />that last time.
1131130 1132522 I felt a little tingle.
1132696 1133915 <i>The money back<br />guarantee one.</i>
1134089 1135917 I'm putting your call<br />through now.
1136091 1137136 <i>I've just died,<br />and she's already remarried.</i>
1137310 1139007 Sell him the honeymoon package.
1139181 1140487 I'll kill the new husband,<br />and I'll possess the ex-wife.
1140661 1142097 I'll make her<br />do some unseemly things,
1142271 1143664 - and then I'll post the pics.
1143838 1145100 <i>Can I pay<br />in installments?</i>
1150758 1152063 I'm needed upstairs.
1152238 1154370 - Bob, hold down the fort.
1163510 1164728 <i>Ou je suis?</i>
1164902 1166077 - Where am I?<br />-Take a number,
1166252 1167166 - take a seat.
1177045 1179613 I'm more of a dog person.
1179787 1182137 You! Room 515. Now.
1187925 1189144 - Come on.<br />- Come on.
1189318 1190493 Hey,<br />easy with the suit.
1190667 1191494 Don't "Detective" me,
1191668 1192930 you walking disaster.
1193104 1194497 - We got reports.<br />- Another protestor.
1194671 1195890 <i>There is a ten-o-nine.</i>
1196064 1200024 Wolf Jackson,<br />Afterlife Crime Unit.
1200895 1202201 Let me take a wild stab.
1202766 1203724 Actor.
1203898 1206117 Not just any actor.
1206292 1209425 I've done it all.<br />For six movies and a reboot,
1209599 1211732 I became Frank Hardballer.
1211906 1214125 Doing my own stunts<br />was non-negotiable.
1214300 1215953 - You know why?<br />- Authenticity.
1216127 1217520 Correct.
1217694 1219957 A vice cop doesn't<br />get to a perp's door
1220131 1223396 and then call for some hambone<br />stunt man to break it down.
1223570 1225136 Neither did I.
1225311 1226834 You gotta keep it real.
1227008 1228488 Looks like you got a little<br />too real there, bud.
1231012 1232187 Who knew it was a live grenade?
1233014 1234189 Your name came up
1234363 1236670 on this case I'm investigating.
1241370 1242893 Recognize this puss?
1245069 1246723 Never seen that chick<br />before in my life.
1246897 1247942 Or afterlife.
1252120 1254688 -Any idea
1254862 1256516 why my suspect wrote your name
1256690 1258431 in this schmo's goo?
1258605 1262261 Uh... Hard to say, Wolf,<br />but could be a super-fan.
1262435 1264001 You know,<br />guys like you and me...
1264175 1266134 - ...we drive the gals crazy.
1266308 1268092 She collected<br />all her body parts.
1268267 1271444 My hunch<br />is she's out for revenge.
1271618 1274838 <i>And you seem to be numero uno<br />on her hit list.</i>
1275012 1276100 Well, wouldn't be<br />the first woman
1276275 1277450 who wanted to kill me.
1277624 1279495 And kinda hard<br />to kill a dead guy.
1279669 1280801 This gal can.
1280975 1282585 She's a soul sucker.
1282759 1284326 Oh, yeah,<br />you could say that again.
1285980 1288461 My advice, lay low.
1288635 1291377 She gets her hands on you<br />and you're dead-dead.
1291551 1294249 And there's no coming back<br />from that, Mr. Juice.
1294423 1295511 Roger that.

1348347 1350697 I just don't believe<br />I won't see Charles again.
1350871 1352307 Be comforted in the knowledge
1352481 1354701 that he's in<br />a far better place.
1354875 1357138 Angels are guiding him<br />towards everlasting light
1357312 1359749 and may his soul fly through<br />the heavenly gates,
1359923 1361664 like the birds<br />that he so adored
1361838 1363449 and soar over<br />the Fields of Elysium
1363623 1365189 to the glory that is thine.
1366147 1367191 What?
1375330 1377158 I haven't been to a funeral<br />since Dad's.
1378115 1379378 Death is hard.
1381249 1382990 Yeah, sometimes<br />I think life is harder.
1384165 1385253 I know.
1387298 1390171 Listen, if you wanna talk<br />to that therapist again...
1390345 1391346 There you go again.
1392434 1393696 You just sidestep
1393870 1395002 every possible<br />conversation about him.
1396003 1396960 Astrid...
1397918 1399398 I loved your father,
1399572 1401704 but our relationship was over
1401878 1403619 a long time<br />before the accident.
1405404 1407014 I still don't understand<br />why you can't see him.
1411235 1412802 - Why not?<br />- I wish I knew.
1413847 1415196 But this ability
1415370 1417111 didn't exactly<br />come with instructions.
1418460 1420462 It all started<br />when I was your age.
1420636 1422333 It's ironic, isn't it?
1422508 1423813 You can apparently<br />see any random ghost
1423987 1425467 for your shitty TV show,
1425641 1426468 but the one ghost<br />that actually matters to me
1426642 1427991 you can't see at all.
1448447 1449796 We are closed!
1449970 1452625 I'm sorry to bother you.<br />My name's Charles Deetz.
1452799 1454757 I'm feeling<br />a little lightheaded.
1454931 1456019 Where am I?
1456193 1457717 Damn newbies.
1457891 1460023 You wait! In waiting room!
1461024 1462939 All right.
1463113 1465159 - Unbelievable.
1474081 1475517 Hey...
1475691 1476997 - who's there?
1532356 1535055 - My ex-wife is back.<br />- Hmm?
1535229 1537231 Well, I know<br />what you're thinking...
1537405 1540713 "When was the Juice<br />ever tied down?
1540887 1544151 What kind of woman could ever<br />keep him satisfied?" Well...
1650300 1652128 <i>Mazel tov.</i>
1679329 1681114 Now she's back,
1681288 1682419 and she's pissed.
1712667 1713668 Hey.
1715801 1717716 Must be pretty<br />noisy up here. Yeah?
1719021 1720109 In here, too.
1722285 1724548 Listen, if you ever<br />need to process
1724723 1726550 any of your emotions,<br />I'm here for you.
1730119 1732818 Emotions processed. Thanks.
1732992 1735516 I saw you standing<br />at your grandfather's grave.
1737170 1738301 He must have been<br />a pretty dope dude.
1741043 1742653 Death is so, like...
1744090 1747746 It's, like, tragic,<br />you know?
1747920 1750966 I mean, if you ever wanna,<br />you know, cry or just,
1751140 1752533 kind of rage against<br />some of these feelings
1752707 1754404 that you have going on<br />in there,
1754578 1755710 I want you to know
1755884 1758017 that I could be that...
1758191 1761150 kinda dope dad-dude for you.<br />You know?
1763544 1764719 - I'm good.<br />- You know,
1764893 1765720 times like this<br />can bring a family
1765894 1767896 weirdly closer together.
1768070 1769463 On the way over here,
1769637 1771117 I wrote a poem<br />for your grandpa.
1771291 1773510 Oh, did you? How does it go?
1775208 1777253 It's, it's, it's...
1777427 1778951 it starts...
1779125 1781692 It, well, it kinda like<br />opens on grief. Obviously.
1781867 1784478 And then acceptance.
1784652 1786654 It's long. I didn't memorize it<br />or anything like that,
1786828 1788351 but it's quite beautiful.
1788525 1790179 Cut the crap, Rory.
1790353 1792225 All right? I'm not falling<br />for your New Age,
1792399 1794096 overly emotional,<br />trauma bonding,
1794270 1795619 yoga retreat bullshit.
1796359 1797317 I see you.
1798405 1799493 Because, like you,
1799667 1802496 my mom is a very broken person.
1802670 1804324 Okay?<br />She's a delusional fantasist.
1805542 1806717 You just exploit her.
1806892 1807849 And if she wants<br />to allow that to happen,
1808023 1808981 that's on her.
1819034 1820644 I'm so sorry<br />for your loss. I'm sorry.
1820819 1823125 I know, I know. Thank you.
1823299 1826302 Oh, if it isn't<br />little Jane Butterfield.
1826476 1827869 Littler Jane?
1828043 1829262 Oh, it's Jane Butterfield-Lee<br />now.
1829436 1830567 We hyphenated.
1830741 1831742 Is that Maxie Dean?
1833048 1834136 No.
1834310 1835572 No one's here yet.
1838010 1839620 Sample from<br />my hubby's microbrewery.
1839794 1843102 "Micro"? Is that for people<br />with tiny houses?
1843276 1846453 Why is your house<br />covered in black fabric?
1846627 1848542 It's a mourning shroud.
1848716 1851501 Now that Charles is dead,<br />so also dies this house.
1851675 1854287 And I'm protecting it<br />in its transition.
1854461 1857159 To a new life<br />with a new family.
1857333 1858682 I can't wait to show it.
1858857 1860293 Buyers are already lining up.
1860467 1862034 Thanks to you, Lydia,
1862208 1864210 everyone wants a piece<br />of the original Ghost House.
1864384 1865864 Ghosts aren't real.
1866038 1868214 Only gullible people<br />believe that kind of crap.
1868388 1869780 Unless you're trying to pay<br />the bills, right, Mom?
1869955 1871695 Okay, honey, in we go.
1873306 1874873 Can I have<br />everyone's attention, please?
1875047 1875917 What?
1876091 1877484 We're gathered here today
1877658 1881009 to celebrate the life<br />of an extraordinary man.
1881183 1882228 Now, I only had the pleasure
1882402 1883925 of meeting Charles a few times.
1884099 1886232 Then I can tell you<br />he didn't want any speeches.
1886406 1888887 Charles hated<br />public displays of emotion.
1889061 1892194 Yeah, but he also...
1892368 1894327 chose to live his life<br />to the fullest.
1894501 1897504 I'm going to tear a page<br />out of Charles Deetz's book.
1897678 1899332 Lydia,
1899506 1900550 now, I know<br />we had always agreed
1900724 1901638 to take<br />our relationship slowly.
1901812 1903249 But I can't wait any longer.
1903423 1906121 Let's get married<br />on your favorite holiday.
1906295 1908123 Will you marry me on Halloween?
1908297 1909516 - Good Lord!<br />- Uh...
1910778 1912127 That's... That's in two days!
1912301 1913607 Yes, I know.
1913781 1914521 I've already spoken<br />to Father Damien.
1914695 1916088 The church is available.
1916262 1917393 The Lord's sanctuary<br />welcomes all who seek
1917567 1919134 salvation<br />and everlasting glory.
1919308 1922181 Just not before noon,<br />and between three and four.
1922355 1924661 You're seriously doing this<br />at Charles' wake?
1925749 1928535 Yes. Yes. Yes, because...
1929928 1931842 because as we stand here,
1932017 1933844 - surrounded by death...
1934019 1936325 ...let us all make<br />a commitment to choose life.
1936499 1937761 Because I want to spend
1937936 1938849 the rest of my life<br />with you, Lydia.
1940634 1941678 And you, Delia.
1943376 1944986 And you too.
1945160 1946727 And you. Again.
1947554 1948511 What do you say?
1950209 1951384 Rory, I... Come on,
1951558 1953603 I can't commit to this<br />right now.
1956171 1957738 Oh.
1958521 1959740 All right.
1962786 1964353 This is too much loss.
1964527 1965746 What do you mean?
1965920 1967313 Well, first,<br />the death of Charles.
1967487 1968836 And of course,<br />the death of my grandfather,
1969010 1970403 which you know about.<br />And now the death of...
1972405 1974494 - us.<br />- No! No, I...
1974668 1976322 Come on, I didn't mean that.
1976496 1977888 Thought you wanted to take<br />life's great big bungee jump
1978063 1978977 right beside me.
1979151 1980891 No safety nets, right?
1981066 1982415 - But I guess,
1982589 1984373 the only thing<br />bungee jumping today is love.
1984547 1986985 - And that cord just snapped.
1987159 1988943 Come on. Rory...
1989117 1991163 - I love you.<br />- And I love you.
1993513 1995167 Oh.
1995341 1996559 What are we waiting for?
1998561 1999998 Okay, I guess.
2003479 2004567 Oh, my God.
2008876 2009790 She said "yes"!
2012010 2013011 She said "yes"!

2106843 2107801 Are you okay?
2115069 2116940 Are you okay?<br />What happened?
2117115 2119987 Yeah. I'll live.
2121467 2122511 Uh, what are you reading?
2123773 2125384 <i>Crime and Punishment.</i>
2125558 2127125 - One of those.<br />-"One of those"?
2127299 2128735 What does that mean?
2128909 2130780 Nothing.<br />I've read it three times.
2130954 2133218 - Did you really?<br />- Yeah.
2133392 2134915 "Pain and suffering<br />are always inevitable."
2135089 2135916 Yes.
2136090 2137831 Yeah, I...
2138005 2141182 I can't believe you're quoting<br />Dostoevsky. That's...
2141356 2142749 Where have you been<br />all my life?
2147623 2149495 So, how long have<br />you been in Winter River?
2149669 2150844 My whole life.
2151018 2152541 I've never seen you<br />around before.
2152715 2154195 Yeah, this is just<br />a temporary layover
2154369 2155675 for my grandpa's funeral.
2157155 2158504 Until my mom's janky fiance
2158678 2160984 turned it into<br />a de facto engagement party.
2161159 2162377 Yeah, he announced<br />their wedding date.
2163422 2166338 Wow. That's different.
2166512 2167687 Oh, yeah.<br />If you knew my mom,
2167861 2169167 that's actually<br />pretty on-brand for her.
2170559 2172170 Is your dad<br />in the picture or...
2173562 2174520 No.
2176043 2177262 Yeah, he was a free spirit.
2178393 2180047 Defender of hopeless causes.
2180221 2182354 When they split,<br />he went to Brazil.
2182528 2183877 He was trying<br />to save the rainforest.
2185487 2186706 But my mom grew up here.
2186880 2188360 That old house on the hill.
2189665 2190753 Wait. The Ghost House?
2191885 2193234 Is your mom Lydia Deetz?
2194148 2195062 Unfortunately.
2195236 2196759 She's a legend.
2196933 2198848 Well, yeah, if you believe<br />in supernatural bullshit.
2199806 2200763 You don't?
2202417 2204027 - No.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
2204202 2205681 I only believe in things<br />that I can see.
2205855 2207466 You know, science. Facts.
2210033 2211470 Oh.
2211644 2213472 - Yeah, it's gonna keep going.
2213646 2215952 Back to the insanity.
2216126 2218216 I'm sorry about your fence,<br />by the way.
2218390 2219826 You can tell your parents<br />my mom will pay for that.
2220000 2222176 Nah, that's okay. It's...<br />They won't even notice.
2223743 2227747 Uh... Well, listen,<br />I'll be here tomorrow,
2227921 2231446 if you want a break<br />from the insanity.
2265828 2267134 Witness confirmed our suspect
2267308 2269179 as the soul sucker<br />from Lost and Found.
2269354 2270224 Wanna hear<br />the weird part, chief?
2270398 2271704 Hit me.
2271878 2272748 After she turned the owner
2272922 2274837 into a human pancake,
2275011 2276665 she stole a wedding dress<br />from the conveyor.
2276839 2279364 Of course.<br />This stapled sicko...
2279538 2280800 has her twisted heart set
2280974 2284456 on a romantic reunion<br />with Mr. Juice.
2284630 2286066 She won't stop killing,
2286240 2289069 until she walks him<br />back down the aisle.
2291332 2295249 Cases like this make me wonder<br />why I even became a cop.
2298121 2299732 You're not a cop.<br />You're an actor.
2300689 2301647 Thank you, Janet.
2302735 2304171 You keep me real.
2304345 2305390 Should we take<br />this Beetlejuice
2305564 2306739 into protective custody?
2306913 2308088 See if you can find him.
2308262 2309568 He's probably laying low.
2309742 2311787 Scared out of his mind.
2317706 2319665 A little higher, boys.
2319839 2321667 We can't let Delores<br />get through that door.
2328978 2330328 Bob.
2330502 2331503 Like lookin' in a mirror.
2333243 2335158 You see, Bob,<br />you'd serve as my decoy.
2335333 2336943 You'd walk in front of me<br />at all times.
2337117 2340120 That way she'd suck your soul<br />while I make my getaway.
2341556 2342992 <i>¿Comprende?</i>
2355440 2356832 Now's my chance.
2369105 2370455 What?
2370629 2372108 - Why?
2372282 2374633 No! No! No!
2374807 2376330 Delia, what's wrong?
2376504 2377897 I'm trying to capture<br />the perfect primal scream.
2378071 2379551 I'm gonna blow it up,<br />mount it on the wall,
2379725 2381857 and I invite all of you<br />to do the same.
2382031 2383685 - Why?<br />- For the Collective.
2383859 2385774 We cannot sincerely celebrate
2385948 2388342 all that was good<br />about our dearly departed.
2388516 2390344 Not until we release the horror
2390518 2391954 that they inflicted upon us.
2392128 2394392 What awful thing<br />did Grandpa ever do to you?
2394566 2397090 He bought this house<br />without telling me.
2399788 2402138 Oh, my God!
2402312 2403923 I was helpfully getting<br />some boxes in town,
2404097 2405533 then I heard you screaming.<br />Are you all right?
2405707 2407405 It was Delia.
2407579 2408928 Oh, Delia.
2409102 2410320 I'm good.
2411147 2412366 Ignore her.
2412540 2414063 That was very<br />thoughtful of you.
2414237 2416239 Astrid, can you give him<br />a hand with the boxes?
2418285 2419721 I told the movers to come<br />a week from today. All right?
2419895 2420809 I think that'll give us all<br />time to get over
2420983 2422637 our grief and our trauma.
2422811 2423943 And then, after the wedding,<br />I think we should go back,
2424117 2425553 and we gotta<br />finish those shows.
2425727 2426859 Maybe Mom can get<br />the ghosts in the attic
2427033 2428556 to give us a hand.
2428730 2431690 Adam and Barbara Maitland.<br />They're not here anymore.
2431864 2433431 Why? They find<br />a better house to haunt?
2433605 2436303 No, we found a loophole,<br />and they moved on.
2437130 2438610 How convenient.
2508680 2509637 Ew.
2557511 2559078 Oh.
2559252 2560949 God, I thought I lost those.
2563038 2566912 That was taken at an all-night<br />Mario Bava horror fest.
2567086 2569567 I was nine months<br />pregnant with you.
2569741 2572091 <i>My water broke during<br />Kill, Baby... Kill!</i>
2573788 2574920 Dad's favorite movie.
2575094 2576008 Yeah.
2576182 2577139 Can I keep this?
2578184 2579838 Yeah.
2580012 2581753 I really like that model<br />of Winter River, too.
2582754 2584190 Did Grandpa make that?
2584364 2587019 [Lydia] No, that belonged<br />to the Maitlands.
2587193 2589630 You know,<br />the non-existent ghost couple.
2598683 2600119 Oh, I found that on the floor.
2600293 2603339 - Hey, who's Beetlejuice?<br />- Don't ever say that name!
2603513 2604993 Not ever!
2605167 2607300 - Beetlejuice.<br />- No! Astrid, I'm serious.
2607474 2609781 If you say that name<br />three times, really bad stuff
2609955 2611260 - is gonna happen.<br />- Like what?
2611434 2613262 In fact,<br />this attic is off-limits.
2613436 2614916 Do you understand me?
2615090 2616265 Yeah, I understand<br />that you're crazy.
2632064 2633369 Oh, my God, it's you!
2633543 2635589 I thought a moose<br />was about to attack me.
2635763 2637896 It's breathing exercises.
2638070 2639637 Try seeing ghosts every day.
2641116 2642117 Astrid!
2643292 2644206 - Let her be.
2644380 2645860 God, she hates me.
2648036 2650560 Somehow, Richard's<br />death is still my fault.
2650735 2652432 You blamed me<br />for your mother's.
2652606 2654129 She's not dead.
2654303 2657176 And I didn't blame you.<br />I resented you.
2657350 2658351 There's a difference.
2658525 2659918 You weren't very nice.
2660092 2662485 No, you barely acknowledged<br />my existence.
2662660 2664313 But we've done all right,<br />haven't we?
2664487 2667403 Yeah. Ever since I sold out<br />and got famous,
2667577 2668753 we have gotten closer.
2668927 2670537 No, I started liking you<br />before that.
2675498 2676848 Again with<br />the creepy breathing!
2677022 2678719 It works!
2678893 2680765 I learned it at the survivors'<br />retreat, where I met Rory.
2680939 2682288 Of course you did.
2682462 2684203 Look, I was in shock<br />after Richard died.
2684377 2686292 And I was working on<br />my unresolved feelings,
2686466 2688163 and Rory had just lost<br />his fiancee
2688337 2689643 in a skiing accident,
2689817 2691732 and we were<br />in the same sorrow circle
2691906 2693429 and we connected.
2693603 2695344 Yeah.
2695518 2697520 He was turned on by you at<br />the lowest point in your life.
2697695 2699392 Okay, but this isn't about him.
2699566 2701263 Astrid found this in the attic.
2701437 2703135 Ew. So?
2703744 2705267 So?
2705441 2707574 Every now and then<br />I feel his presence.
2707748 2709010 Like he's lurking somewhere,
2709184 2710577 just out of reach.
2710751 2711883 But lately,
2712057 2713580 I'm seeing him again.
2713754 2715930 And I was really hoping<br />this was all in my head.
2716104 2717410 But now this?
2717584 2719499 Lydia, you need<br />to take back your life.
2719673 2722502 From the hanger-onners,<br />from this thing.
2722676 2724025 Where's the obnoxious<br />little goth girl
2724199 2726158 who tormented me<br />all those years ago?
2727072 2728726 It's time to find her.
2743131 2744393 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
2750443 2752358 - Jeremy, is that you?<br />- Yeah.
2752532 2754534 Uh, Mom, I'm just gonna<br />be upstairs with a friend.
2754708 2755883 Okay. Have fun.
2760932 2762107 - Hey, Dad.<br />- Son.
2762281 2764283 Stuck on...<br />He lives in that room.
2775337 2777600 You've got a lot of '90s vinyl.
2777775 2778688 Where are you<br />finding this, eBay?
2778863 2781691 No, I troll old record stores.
2781866 2783693 I don't trust<br />what I can't touch.
2789830 2791049 <i>Handbook for<br />the Recently Deceased.</i>
2791223 2793399 Yeah, I got that<br />at a yard sale in town.
2793573 2796010 The illustrations<br />are pretty gnarly.
2796184 2797707 Yeah, looks like<br />the kinda crappy book
2797882 2798839 my mom would write.
2800362 2801668 What's the deal<br />with your parents?
2801842 2804062 Well, my mom spends<br />every waking hour
2804236 2806804 in the kitchen stress-baking.
2806978 2809197 And my dad used to work<br />at the paper mill,
2809371 2810851 but then he had an accident,
2811025 2813854 so now he's a full-time<br />couch potato.
2814028 2816335 I can't wait to get out<br />of this shitty town.
2818293 2820774 Um, you must have been<br />to a lot of places
2820948 2823124 traveling, with a famous mom.
2823298 2825039 Not really.
2825213 2826867 My dad's<br />more the traveler anyway.
2827041 2827955 We used to have this big plan
2828129 2829435 where we were gonna visit
2829609 2831132 the top ten<br />creepiest places on Earth.
2831306 2834309 So, Tower of London<br />and Dracula's Castle and...
2834483 2837486 yeah, then we never<br />got the chance to do it.
2838313 2839358 What happened?
2840402 2842535 A boat accident.
2842709 2844232 Yeah, they searched<br />the Amazon for a week,
2844406 2845668 and they never found his body.
2849411 2850412 You really miss him.
2852501 2854025 Yeah.
2854199 2855461 You know,<br />I at least would have liked
2855635 2857115 to have gotten the chance<br />to say goodbye.
2857289 2858551 But can't your mom,
2858725 2860161 I don't know, like,
2860335 2862642 contact him or...
2862816 2863948 She claims<br />she can't even see him.
2864122 2865906 - Why not?<br />- Because she's a fraud.
2866080 2868822 Well, I think<br />that's a little harsh.
2870476 2872652 Uh, well, tomorrow's Halloween.
2872826 2875873 I know. Used to be<br />my favorite holiday.
2876047 2878005 Because my dad,<br />he would go all out
2878179 2879833 and make the most<br />age-inappropriate costumes.
2880007 2881574 - Yeah, I think I was
2881748 2883881 <i>in second grade when I went<br />as Munch's The Scream.</i>
2884055 2886709 - Wow. Yeah.<br />- Yeah. It was a choice.
2886884 2888059 But now my mom's<br />getting married that day,
2888233 2889451 so I don't know,
2889625 2891149 probably be<br />my least favorite now.
2891323 2892367 Well, what time's the wedding?
2892541 2894674 Midnight. The witching hour.
2894848 2896589 Future stepdad's lame idea.
2898156 2900985 Well, why don't you<br />come over...
2902116 2903074 earlier?
2904336 2905990 Uh, we could,
2906164 2910037 I don't know, we could order<br />pizza and give out candy.
2911952 2914912 Only if you want to.<br />I mean that's, that's no...
2915695 2916957 no pressure.
2920961 2923703 What is up<br />with these creepy birds?
2923877 2925923 Bird-watching<br />was my dad's passion.
2926097 2927925 Oh, I contacted<br />that vintage shop
2928099 2929883 you love in SoHo.
2930057 2932233 They've sent a few<br />potential wedding dresses.
2932407 2933931 Should be here later today.
2934105 2935454 Ooh, great. Thanks.
2937195 2938587 And a, uh,
2938761 2940894 little bird may have<br />chirped our big news
2941068 2943070 to a few news outlets.
2943244 2945420 Thought we could<br />sell the photos exclusively.
2945594 2947205 Could be great press<br />for the show.
2947379 2949903 I... Look, I'm really excited<br />about tying the knot,
2950077 2953298 but can we just keep it<br />small and private?
2953472 2955691 Yeah. Well, sure.
2955865 2956866 It's your big day.
2957563 2958651 Night. Whatever.
2960958 2962481 <i>Yo, I've got fevers running</i>
2962655 2964222 <i>all through me. All through me!</i>
2970054 2971011 Lydia?
2972447 2974754 I want you out of my life!
2974928 2975929 Do you hear me?
2976582 2977583 Lydia?
2979106 2981891 Who are you yelling at?
2982066 2984198 Do you remember that<br />couples therapist that we saw,
2984372 2985721 - Dr. Glickman?<br />- Mmm.
2985895 2987462 He said that I was holding<br />something back
2987636 2989943 and until I faced it,<br />you and I wouldn't evolve.
2990117 2992467 - Mmm.<br />- Okay, well, he was right.
2992641 2994774 And I'm going to tell you now.
2994948 2995949 And, fair warning,
2996123 2998647 it's gonna sound batshit crazy.
2998821 3001041 Are you okay with that?
3001215 3002608 Of course. I'd love to.
3002782 3004305 Let's break through<br />this barrier together.
3004479 3006133 Okay, just give me a sec.
3010050 3011530 When I was a teenager,
3011704 3014881 a trickster demon<br />terrorized my entire family
3015055 3016578 and tried to force me<br />to marry him,
3016752 3019799 in order to come back<br />to the real world for good.
3019973 3022323 I believed he was gone forever,
3022497 3024630 and then lately,<br />I have been seeing him again.
3024804 3027328 And now, he is actually back.
3027502 3030940 And I don't know why,<br />or how, or what to do.
3033682 3035380 Okay, so you're saying that<br />someone called Beetlejuice...
3035554 3036903 Don't say his name!
3037077 3038774 If you say his name<br />three times,
3038948 3040298 he will appear.
3042300 3045564 Okay. So this...
3045738 3048567 demon is clearly a construct<br />of your unpacked trauma.
3048741 3050134 It's trauma that<br />you're gonna need to face,
3050308 3051657 otherwise, it's just<br />gonna get worse.
3051831 3054834 He's not a construct.<br />He is literally a demon.
3056401 3058664 I know this<br />is a big step for you.
3058838 3060405 But in the words<br />of Dr. Glickman,
3060579 3062494 I'm gonna give you<br />the push you need.
3064974 3066150 Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,<br />Beetlejuice.
3069849 3071546 [electricity crackling]
3074462 3075811 What just happened?
3075985 3077335 We're in the model.
3078292 3079598 That's not possible.
3083645 3084777 [Rory shakily] What the hell?
3084951 3086300 I told you not to say his name!
3090870 3092785 <i>Lydia Deetz,<br />ladies and gentlemen!</i>
3092959 3094526 <i>Don't ever<br />say that name.</i>
3094700 3097268 <i>Not ever!<br />We need to leave, now.</i>
3097442 3099096 <i>Beetlejuice,<br />Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.</i>
3101794 3103100 - Is that...<br />- Beetlejuice!
3107626 3109280 First of all,<br />I want you two kids to know,
3109454 3111195 this is a safe space. Okay?
3111369 3112674 Feel free<br />to express yourselves.
3112848 3114676 Don't be afraid. I sense<br />there's an enabler here,
3114850 3115721 but we'll get to that.
3115895 3117026 Look, dig deep
3117201 3118158 and spill your guts.
3118332 3119551 Okay? Who wants to go first?
3119725 3121074 - Huh?
3121248 3122597 All right, I will.
3126558 3128429 There you go. See?<br />I'm willing to do the work.
3128603 3130039 You two kids<br />need to get in touch
3130214 3131650 with your inner child.
3131824 3133217 Mine'll be along<br />in just a jiffy.
3148884 3151104 Everybody says<br />he's got my eyes.
3151278 3153933 - Personally, I don't see it.
3154107 3155543 - Scram, kid.
3158633 3159808 You're just my unpacked trauma.
3159982 3161332 You're just my unpacked trauma.
3161506 3163290 You're a figment<br />of my imagination.
3163464 3164770 Really?
3164944 3166163 Is this a figment<br />of your imagination?
3172430 3173909 Leg man.
3174083 3175694 Just like his old man.
3183267 3185660 That was you stalking me.
3185834 3187140 Hey, if stalking means
3187314 3188663 trying to remarry<br />the love of my life,
3188837 3191057 well, I'm guilty as charged.<br />Come here!
3191231 3192798 Home, home, home!
3206725 3211730 <i>♪ Wherever you go<br />Whatever you do ♪</i>
3211904 3217257 <i>♪ I will be right here<br />Waiting for you ♪</i>
3219607 3220739 What happened?
3220913 3222741 I just had the wildest dream.
3224264 3226571 Yeah, I think<br />we should lay off the pills.
3234970 3236494 Snakes?
3236668 3238583 Actually, asps.
3238757 3240149 Aren't they beautiful?
3240324 3241673 Wedding gift for Rory?
3241847 3244589 Too late.<br />They've been defanged.
3244763 3246808 Guaranteed harmless,<br />and they're for me.
3247722 3248897 In Ancient Egypt,
3249071 3250421 a queen would perform<br />a ceremony
3250595 3252249 at the tomb of her pharaoh<br />using snakes,
3252423 3254425 the symbol of undying love.
3254599 3255904 - Are you sure about that?<br />- Mmm-hmm.
3256078 3257254 We read that<br />they were a constant threat
3257428 3258342 to Ra in the underworld
3258516 3259691 and represented total chaos.
3259865 3260953 Okay, see,<br />that's why schools need
3261127 3262650 more art and less reading.
3262824 3264478 You got your wish,<br />we're leaving.
3264652 3265653 So go pack up your things,
3265827 3266828 I'm driving you back to school.
3267002 3268265 Wait, what happened?
3268439 3270441 You wouldn't believe me<br />if I told you.
3270615 3272617 I will pay<br />for a fleet of movers
3272791 3274662 to take everything<br />back to Manhattan,
3274836 3276055 except that model.
3276229 3278231 We need to chop it up<br />and burn it.
3278405 3279711 Oh.
3279885 3281800 You're calling off the wedding?
3285760 3286935 What did that<br />cheese ball do now?
3287109 3288285 It's not Rory.
3288459 3289373 It's Beetlejuice.
3289547 3290548 He's here.
3290722 3292201 In the model. I saw him.
3292376 3294378 Rory saw him, too,<br />but he thinks it's a dream.
3294552 3295770 Wait,<br />we can't leave yet.
3297555 3300471 I have plans tomorrow<br />with this boy that I met.
3302777 3304649 How did you have time<br />to meet a boy?
3304823 3306433 You had time to get married.
3306607 3308827 [smacks lips] She doesn't<br />mean it. It's just karma.
3309001 3310219 Whatever. I was biking
3310394 3311960 and then I kinda crashed<br />into his fence
3312134 3313832 and we started talking,
3314006 3314920 and then he invited me over<br />to his place for Halloween.
3317226 3318576 Can I go, Mom?
3318750 3320055 Mmm-mmm.
3320229 3321230 Please?
3324495 3326888 I will not allow<br />that menace to humanity
3327062 3328934 to upheave our family again.
3329108 3332241 No one goes in there,<br />no one calls his name!
3332416 3334156 We're gonna be fine, right?
3334331 3336637 Mom, come on!<br />I'm gonna be late.
3349781 3351348 Trick or treat!
3355787 3357005 Are you sure<br />this is the right address?
3357179 3358790 Yeah.
3358964 3360531 - 125 Jefferson Lane.
3360705 3362402 Don't judge... all right?
3362576 3363969 His dad just got<br />into an accident at work,
3364143 3365362 and they're going through<br />a rough patch.
3365536 3366711 Trick or treat!
3366885 3367842 He's cute.
3369191 3370454 What are you doing?
3370628 3371803 I was gonna go<br />say "hey" to his parents.
3371977 3373761 Seriously?<br />This isn't a playdate.
3373935 3374849 I mean,<br />we're not six years old.
3375023 3375981 Nothing's gonna happen.
3376155 3378157 All right, okay. You're right.
3378331 3381247 Have fun,<br />and I'll pick you up at 10:00.
3381421 3382683 Not a second later.
3386774 3387732 Come on, quick!
3390299 3391388 Trick or treat!
3409580 3412191 I, uh,<br />raided the basement.
3412365 3414454 I forgot we even<br />had half this stuff.
3414628 3415716 Yeah, you really went all out.
3415890 3417588 Yeah.
3417762 3419546 I like the James Dean costume,<br />by the way.
3419720 3420721 Thank you. But yeah,
3420895 3422331 my parents think<br />I look more like
3422506 3424159 <i>Richie from Happy Days.</i>
3424333 3426248 - Mmm?<br />- Your costume looks great.
3427380 3428947 Who are you supposed to be?
3429121 3430122 Marie Curie.
3432298 3433821 Two-time Nobel Prize-winning<br />French physicist
3433995 3435562 - and feminist icon.<br />- Oh, she was, uh,
3435736 3437912 she discovered radiation.<br />Right?
3438086 3439218 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.
3439392 3440306 Yeah, her work was killing her.
3440480 3441612 She didn't even realize it.
3441786 3443701 Yeah, well,<br />for someone who is dying
3443875 3445920 of radiation poisoning,
3446094 3449533 uh, you look beautiful.
3449707 3453101 I brought some candy.<br />Or a lot of... I...
3453275 3454538 It's probably<br />too much actually.
3454712 3456235 But, uh, we can, I don't know,
3456409 3458237 maybe binge on whatever's<br />left over, if you want?
3458411 3460282 Or we could start<br />handing it out now,
3460457 3461849 if that's...
3462023 3463547 - what you wanna do.<br />- Yeah.
3463721 3466288 Uh, I have a confession, actually.
3467812 3470771 I'd rather stay up here<br />with you.
3474253 3476298 Okay. Yeah.
3477212 3478213 That works, too.
3510768 3512639 Please don't freak out.
3512813 3513771 What are you?
3514772 3515729 Don't you know?
3517688 3519864 Astrid, really,<br />you don't have to be scared.
3521866 3523084 You're a ghost.
3527175 3528742 My mom was telling the truth.<br />Shit!
3528916 3530352 When my mom and dad<br />used to fight,
3530527 3532093 I used to steal<br />one of my dad's six-packs
3532267 3534095 and go hide out<br />in the tree fort.
3534269 3535270 And one day,
3536837 3537751 I slipped
3537925 3538883 and fell.
3540362 3541450 How long ago did that happen?
3541625 3543714 23 years, 5 months and 14 days.
3543888 3545324 But who's counting?
3545498 3546717 I've been stuck in this house<br />for 23 years.
3546891 3549633 I can't go any further<br />than that tree.
3549807 3552810 And I've just spent my time<br />watching the world go by.
3552984 3554420 But then you came along,
3554594 3555769 and you could see me.
3557858 3559381 And I've been on my own<br />for so long,
3559556 3561558 it was like a grenade<br />had gone off in my head.
3561732 3562776 It was amazing.
3563603 3564648 You're amazing.
3564822 3566345 - I should go.<br />- Astrid, I know.
3566519 3567738 I know it's insane.
3567912 3571002 But I really like you,
3571176 3572786 and I want us to be together.
3574179 3575789 How?
3575963 3578139 You're dead, I'm alive.<br />That doesn't make any sense.
3579271 3580620 Well, uh,
3580794 3582491 what if I told you
3582666 3584276 that I'd found a way<br />to come back.
3585930 3587279 To be human again.
3587453 3589411 Um, it's all in this book.
3589586 3591283 Uh, everyone gets one of these<br />when they die.
3591457 3592545 It's kind of complicated,
3592719 3594852 but, uh, I can only do it
3595026 3598682 with the help<br />of a living person.
3598856 3601728 And you could literally<br />give me my life back.
3601902 3604383 I don't know.<br />Maybe we could ask my mom?
3604557 3606907 'Cause she's supposed to be<br />the undead expert, right?
3607081 3608474 Yeah, well, I...
3608648 3610998 I'm sure she'll give you<br />a million reasons
3611172 3612521 to stay away.
3612696 3614349 But I'll give you one reason<br />to help me.
3616351 3618571 You'd get to see your dad.
3619398 3620399 Again.
3620573 3626535 [suspenseful music playing]
3634979 3636676 I have the first<br />official open house
3636850 3638243 a week from Sunday,
3638417 3640027 and then we will let<br />the bidding war begin.
3640201 3641333 Where's Rory?
3641507 3643074 Supermarket.
3643248 3645076 Swapping out the candy<br />I bought for carrot sticks.
3645250 3647426 Because Rory loves<br />to fun-suck everything.
3647600 3648775 Even Halloween.
3648949 3651430 Gotta run.<br />See you at the church.
3651604 3654172 Oh. Unless you're calling off<br />the wedding?
3654346 3655347 No, Delia.
3656304 3657218 Where are you going?
3657392 3658785 Cemetery.
3658959 3660874 To commune<br />with my dear husband's spirit.
3663094 3664835 I need to skedaddle, too.
3665009 3666575 I'm co-chaperoning
3666750 3669230 Littler Jane's<br />Girl Scout troop.
3669404 3671493 We spent weeks coming up<br />with a group costume theme.
3671668 3674583 We agreed nothing Disney.
3674758 3676411 The closest<br />we ever got to Disney
3676585 3680328 was when Astrid dressed<br />as Cinderella's dead mom.
3680502 3682156 You'll never guess<br />what the girls came up with.
3682330 3684593 - Mmm?<br />- Fruit salad.
3684768 3686073 Isn't that genius?
3686247 3688075 It's healthy<br />and non-triggering.
3688989 3689947 I'm going as...
3692645 3694516 "reverse mortgage."
3694691 3696518 Which is "mortgage"<br />spelled backwards.
3697781 3699173 Where is Astrid?
3699347 3701654 On a date. Her first.
3701828 3704091 I think I'm more nervous<br />than she is.
3704265 3705745 The boy lives over<br />on Jefferson.
3705919 3707921 Don't mention that street.
3708095 3709009 I have a listing that's kept me
3709183 3711185 from a perfect sales record.
3711359 3713100 Oh, it's my own fault.
3713274 3715537 The place had been<br />on the market for years...
3715712 3718018 but I thought if I could sell<br />the "Murder House,"
3718192 3719498 it would be<br />a feather in my cap.
3719672 3720760 Murder House?
3721456 3722457 Which house?
3723545 3725286 125.
3725460 3727027 That's where<br />I dropped Astrid off.
3727201 3728768 She was seeing<br />a boy named Jeremy.
3728942 3731815 - Jeremy Frazier?
3731989 3733947 I didn't get his last name.
3735079 3736733 Oh, no, it can't be him.
3736907 3739910 But Jeremy Frazier<br />was bad news.
3740084 3743304 Twenty-three years ago,<br />he murdered his parents.
3743478 3745306 The cops found him<br />hiding in his tree house.
3745480 3746394 When they tried to get him out,
3746568 3748353 he fell, broke his neck,
3748527 3750094 died instantly.
3755621 3758015 That's all you have to do<br />to get into the Afterlife?
3758189 3760278 Draw a door with some chalk?
3760452 3761714 Oh, and knock three times?
3761888 3763020 I'm just doing<br />what it says in there.
3763194 3764151 So lame.
3774901 3776816 - Or maybe it's not so lame.
3776990 3778731 And what do we do?<br />We just walk through?
3778905 3780646 I can. But since<br />you're still alive,
3780820 3782909 you have to read<br />that incantation first.
3785346 3788828 <i>"De mundo<br />vivorum audeo in iterum..."</i>
3805714 3806715 Astrid!
3812373 3814245 Jeremy, is that you?
3820338 3823123 <i>"Ut liber iterum<br />ambulet alius."</i>
3824559 3825909 Okay.
3826083 3827606 I think that worked.
3828346 3829390 Astrid!
3832872 3833830 Let's go see your dad.
3837311 3839139 Astrid! No!
3845580 3846581 Okay.
3857549 3859638 Uh, okay, you just wait here.
3859812 3861901 I'm gonna go find out<br />where we're supposed to go.
3862075 3864469 Make sure to ask<br />where my dad is.
3864643 3866645 Excuse me,<br />sorry, sorry for...
3868342 3869387 Merry Christmas.
3869561 3870779 Merry Christmas.
3872346 3873565 Thanks.
3873739 3875219 Okay, we need to go<br />to Immigration.
3882487 3885272 Excuse me, can I<br />please speak to your manager?
3885446 3888362 My wife is gonna flay me<br />if I don't get home soon.
3888536 3890582 That's sweet.<br />Take a number and a seat.
3896849 3898198 Whoa, dude.
3902899 3905205 Oh,<br />Powers of the Hereafter,
3905379 3909383 accept my Charles as<br />I have accepted his passing.
3910123 3911559 No, I haven't.
3911733 3913648 And I won't ever.
3913822 3915781 There is no expiry date<br />on sorrow.
3917043 3919263 Oh. Oh, that's good.
3919437 3923006 Though there is no expiry date<br />on sorrow!
3923180 3924703 Kings of Commerce,
3924877 3926226 Knights of Nasdaq,
3926400 3930535 deem him worthy to enter<br />the gates of your realm.
3930709 3933103 You are no more, my king.
3933277 3935279 But with the blessing<br />of the angels
3935453 3937020 - of undying love...
3937977 3940719 I, your surviving queen,
3940893 3942982 proudly take up the mantle<br />of your...
3948509 3950468 Okay.<br />There you go. Thank you.
3952078 3953732 You all right, honey?<br />You look a little manic.
3953906 3955255 Just pre-wedding jitters.
3955429 3957040 I'm just gonna go up<br />and try on my dress,
3957214 3958780 but don't come up
3958955 3960304 'cause it's bad luck to see me<br />before the ceremony.
3960478 3961435 Sure.
3963785 3966136 Oh, well, hello.<br />Who's clowning around?
3966310 3968051 - Trick or treat!<br />- Trick or treat!
3968225 3969487 Here we are.
3969661 3970967 - Apples...<br />Thank you!
3971141 3972969 ...carrot sticks,<br />and some blonde raisins,
3973143 3974535 'cause no one likes<br />a big, fat clown.
3978452 3979976 I can't believe I'm doing this.
3981499 3983544 Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,<br />Beetlejuice.
4013313 4015272 The Juice is loose.
4017839 4019145 I need you to tell me<br />what this means.
4019319 4021800 Oh, well, let's have a look,<br />shall we?
4021974 4024237 Long story short,<br />your daughter's screwed.
4024411 4026283 She decided to trade lives<br />with the boy.
4026457 4027980 He gets to come back,
4028154 4029460 while she's stuck<br />on the other side permanently.
4029634 4031331 One-way ticket<br />on the Soul Train.
4031505 4032680 - Soul Train?<br />- That's right.
4032854 4035161 Last stop, the Great Beyond.
4035335 4036902 No, she can't<br />get on that train.
4037076 4038599 You've gotta get me in there<br />so I can get her out.
4038773 4040123 Well, I can get you in,
4040297 4042299 but it's gonna<br />take a quid pro quo.
4042473 4044518 Of course there is.<br />What do you want?
4044692 4046433 Well, I've got this ex-wife,<br />you know?
4046607 4048653 And she's kind of a whack job,<br />first of all. We're through.
4048827 4050481 She's kinda clingy.
4050655 4051482 If I could just get away<br />from her permanently somehow.
4051656 4052918 You want me to marry you!
4053092 4054572 I thought you'd never ask.
4054746 4056313 How do I know that<br />you're gonna keep your word?
4056487 4058141 I swear<br />on my dead mother's soul.
4058315 4059577 Yikes!
4061753 4063276 Okay, fine.
4063450 4065148 I'll marry you if you help me<br />save my daughter.
4065322 4066453 I'm gonna need that in writing.
4066627 4068064 - Give me that.<br />- Ow.
4068238 4069195 And here we go.
4072285 4073634 I'm gonna make you so happy.
4073808 4076289 Jesus! What's the plan<br />on getting in?
4076463 4077508 [chalk scraping]
4082774 4083905 Yeah.
4086082 4088432 Well, can't exactly<br />go through the front door.
4100966 4103099 <i>We need<br />a demon possession.</i>
4103273 4104404 <i>Our case worker's<br />on strike</i>

4123249 4124903 Nobody gets through.
4126905 4127906 Let's go, honey.
4148231 4149623 -Trick or treat.<br />- Trick or treat.
4149797 4151147 Whoa, whoa.
4151321 4152452 One each.
4152626 4153671 Honor system.
4153845 4155368 Yeah, right. Asshole.
4156978 4158458 - Huh?
4162288 4163594 Okay, everyone,
4163768 4164725 strawberries get first pick<br />this time.

4762105 4763497 No, you see, those asps,
4763671 4764803 they were defanged.<br />I paid extra for that.
4764977 4766936 Honey, you're dead, okay?
4767110 4768981 Now take a number and sit down.

4814418 4816202 And then the VIP lounge.

4967049 4968572 Oh, my God! My wedding!
4968746 4970226 We're about to start.
4970400 4971879 Wait, Mom, with everything<br />that's happened tonight,
4972054 4973229 you know you don't<br />have to do this, right?
4973403 4974970 I know,<br />but if I don't do it now,
4975144 4977102 I'm never gonna do it.
4977276 4979148 But are you sure about this?
4979322 4982716 Rory loves me,<br />and that's gotta be enough.
4982890 4984544 Quickly, my dear!<br />Come! Come!
4984718 4985850 Oh.
4989071 4990028 And the lost lamb<br />is welcome into thy house
4990202 4991812 - with open arms.<br />- Oh, my God!
4993814 4994946 I thought you got cold feet.
4995120 4996426 Oh, no, blame me.
4996600 4998080 She just saved me<br />from my date from hell.
4998254 4999472 Who are all these people?
4999646 5001474 This is just<br />a couple influencers.
5001648 5003215 Nobody under<br />five million followers,
5003389 5005565 and I think we have<br />a Netflix executive in there.
5005739 5006784 We doing this?
5006958 5008655 Yeah. Where's your dress?
5008829 5010179 All that matters<br />is that I'm here, now.
5010353 5011789 So let's just skip<br />straight to the vows.
5011963 5013138 Wait, where's Delia?
5013312 5014357 - Yo!
5014531 5016837 - Right here.
5017012 5018361 She was helpin' me calm down<br />before the wedding.
5018535 5019927 I was feeling a little jittery.
5020102 5022104 - All, right, beat it.<br />- You.
5023366 5024584 You're that thing...
5024758 5026195 from my dream.
5026369 5028110 Well, I'm really<br />more nightmare material,
5028284 5029720 but, thanks.
5029894 5031461 - You're...<br />- Uh-uh.
5032288 5033593 Part of the deal
5033767 5035073 is you can never,<br />ever say my name, ever!
5035247 5036553 What deal?
5036727 5037945 The deal she made to save you.
5038120 5039208 By the way,<br />you can call me "Dad."
5039382 5040687 Lydia.
5040861 5042776 You agreed to marry him?
5042950 5046041 I was desperate,<br />and it was my only option.
5046215 5047564 Lydia. What's going on here?
5049044 5050741 - Wow.
5050915 5052699 Awkward.
5052873 5054745 You haven't made much progress<br />since our last session,
5054919 5057443 so I'm gonna suggest<br />some drug therapy.
5057617 5059837 Don't be afraid to share.<br />When you're ready.
5066278 5068367 I always thought<br />your whole act was bullshit.
5068541 5070761 I never believed in ghosts,<br />spirits, or any of it.
5070935 5073024 What? All this time?
5073198 5075157 Why the hell<br />did you wanna get married?
5075331 5076549 - Money!
5076723 5077855 I knew I could make more<br />as your husband
5078029 5079378 than I could as your manager.
5079552 5082512 And I never<br />had a dead fiancee.
5082686 5084253 I just went<br />to that survivor's retreat,
5084427 5087082 so that I could meet<br />weak women and exploit them!
5087256 5090259 And I hit the codependent<br />lottery when I met you.
5090433 5092087 How 'bout a little<br />physical therapy?
5100399 5101748 We'd like to thank you all
5101922 5103620 for coming to this<br />very special occasion,
5103794 5106144 but right now<br />we'd like a little privacy.

5406923 5408577 - Mr. Juice,
5408751 5410753 you've violated code 6-9-9!
5410927 5412276 - Freeze!
5413886 5414887 Book 'em, Danno!
5417107 5418587 Beetlejuice!
5422112 5424157 What the...
5424331 5425550 I'm back.
5430555 5431948 Sweetheart!
5432122 5433297 You look fantastic!
5433471 5435168 You look so...
5435342 5437606 - put together.<br />- [in normal voice] He's mine.
5437780 5439912 It's me, not you.<br />You know, honey,
5440086 5442567 I've been goin' through<br />a lotta changes lately.
5442741 5444395 Kind of a mid-afterlife<br />crisis, I guess.
5444569 5447659 Your soul belongs to me,<br />my love.
5447833 5449574 For eternity.
5449748 5450880 You don't wanna<br />spend your eternity with me.
5451054 5452098 I'm a lone wolf.
5452272 5453709 You need a soulmate.
5453883 5456494 Somebody who really sees you.<br />For instance.
5462761 5465068 I need something<br />to draw with. Quick!
5499102 5500103 <i>Olé.</i>
5512332 5513682 - Let's go!<br />- Hey!
5514639 5516336 We had a deal.
5516511 5517990 She doesn't have to marry you.
5518164 5519992 - What?<br />- You violated code 6-9-9.
5520166 5522604 Yeah, you illegally brought<br />my mom into the Afterlife.
5522778 5525041 According to that book,<br />that contract is null and void.
5528784 5531177 Look, I'm sorry things didn't<br />work out between us,
5531351 5533440 but the 600-year age gap
5533615 5535225 was a little bit much for me.
5535399 5536618 - Beetle...<br />- Ah!
5536792 5538228 - Beetlejuice.
5542885 5543842 Beetlejuice.
5551502 5552982 -Hey!<br />- Beetlejuice.
5563514 5565081 Shoulda got married in Vegas.
5573568 5575004 Looks like<br />we're a little late, boys.
5577136 5579182 Tape off the crime scene,<br />call in forensics,
5579356 5581967 and keep<br />the goddamn media away.
5582141 5585231 Little lady, you just<br />popped his Beetlejuice.
5585405 5586711 Say your goodbyes,
5586885 5588583 you can take a selfie now,<br />if you like,
5588757 5589975 but make it quick.
5591803 5593500 Sister, you're comin' with me.
5593675 5595372 What? Delia, what did you do?
5595546 5596895 I fell for a scam,
5597069 5599811 and I'm counting on you<br />to claim a refund.
5599985 5601508 Those snakes were actually<br />poisonous, weren't they?
5601683 5604816 Yeah. So, I died<br />of embarrassment.
5604990 5607036 Your work's gonna<br />go up in value.
5607210 5608733 - Oh! Oh, well, then.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
5609473 5610909 Delia...
5611083 5612607 - I'll miss you.<br />- No, you won't.
5612781 5614609 I'll find Charles<br />and we'll haunt you both,
5614783 5616698 until you beg us to move on!
5616872 5618787 Nice work<br />for a couple of Fleshbags.
5618961 5620658 Don't come knockin'<br />until it's your time,
5620832 5622529 and in the meantime, remember,
5622704 5624357 you gotta keep it real.
5624531 5625837 Come on, beautiful,
5626011 5627839 we got a date<br />with the commissioner.
5673711 5674756 Charles!
5676540 5677672 Delia!
5680109 5681414 I can't believe you're here!
5684374 5685636 Oh, Charles.
5685810 5687464 I'm so happy<br />to see you!
5688378 5689596 Oh, Charles,
5689771 5690989 look what happened to me!
5693688 5695733 This is the 10:13,
5695907 5697692 to the Great Beyond!
5698431 5699650 All aboard
5699824 5701434 the Soul Train!

5714534 5717189 for all your support<br />over the years,
5717363 5720410 but this is my last show.
5720584 5724022 I have spent so much time<br />talking to the dead,
5724196 5726242 it's time I started living.
5729201 5732422 <i>I wanna make memories<br />with the people I love</i>
5732596 5734990 <i>rather than be<br />haunted by them later.</i>
5810935 5812241 Oh, my God.<br />What is that?
5836265 5837832 - Mommy!
5848364 5849887 I just had the weirdest dream.
