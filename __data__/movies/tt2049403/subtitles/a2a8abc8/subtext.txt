203087 205155 Can they coexist?
205189 207291 That's what<br />we're here to find out.
207324 211028 My name is Lydia Deetz,<br />and welcome to <i>Ghost House.</i>
214997 216631 Joining us in the attic tonight
216665 220303 are Emmet and Jody Welch,<br />from Cleghorn, Wisconsin.
220336 223705 Along with their dog, Taco.
223738 224974 And we're gonna hear about how
225007 229078 their dream home<br />became a ghost house.
230947 234117 I've been a psychic mediator<br />for over 15 years.
234150 235885 But nothing<br />could have prepared me
235918 237786 for what I encountered<br />when I visited
237819 238921 the Welch farm.
240223 241324 Here's a preview.
242258 243725 Be warned,
243758 244793 it's intense.
247095 250232 <i>I don't know what I'm gonna</i><br /><i>find behind this door,</i>
250265 253701 <i>but it doesn't want me here.</i>
271119 273388 I feel a dark presence.
273421 275357 We need to leave! Now!
278758 282695 Emmet, are you ready to hear<br />about your paranormal visitors?
282729 283763 Bring it on.
283796 285266 How about you, Jody?
285299 286967 Haven't slept a wink
287001 289403 since we moved<br />into that darned house.
289436 292872 Taco was so freaked out,<br />he goes to the bathroom
292907 295276 in his doggy bed every night.
295309 297378 It's been a living nightmare.
297411 301882 Confronting the unknown.<br />Conquering your fears.
301916 303850 There's nothing harder.
303884 305152 But don't worry.
305186 306753 I'll be right by your...
309821 311057 What the...
311090 312125 No.
313893 315261 No, no.
315295 316296 What's going on?
317397 318965 -I don't know.<br />-Go!
318998 320934 No. No.
320967 322902 -Uh...<br />-You're doing great.
322936 325038 I'm...
325071 327473 Need a break?
327507 329442 -Yeah.<br />-Yeah, let's take a break.
329475 332445 Lydia Deetz,<br />ladies and gentlemen!
332478 334047 Bravo.
336015 337083 I need five. Make it happen.
338151 340018 Okay, everybody, that's lunch!
350295 352965 I told him<br />he needed to wear contacts.
352998 356034 But no, Mr. Big Shot Magician<br />wouldn't listen.
356068 357835 Oh, can you<br />give it a rest, Nadia?
357868 359471 I'm having a really shitty day.
360939 362074 Hmm?
364176 365843 What happened out there?
367279 368846 You okay?
368880 370414 Yeah, I'm fine.
370448 372483 It's these double taping days,
372516 374919 -it can get to me.<br />-Oh, God.
374952 377255 Kills me to see you<br />feeling like this.
377288 378522 Because when<br />you're feeling like this,
378556 379957 it just makes me<br />feel what you're feeling.
379991 381292 So in a weird way it's like,
381325 383127 when you're hurting,<br />it's hurting me.
383160 385396 -I don't know.<br />-God, I'm sorry.
385429 387298 I... I don't mean to make you<br />feel like that.
387331 389533 Oh, babe. Hey, it's okay.
389567 391402 If anything, it just shows<br />how connected we are.
393971 396007 It's like we got the same<br />stupid little heart.
405515 407850 No. You don't need these.
407884 408885 Oh.
409986 411854 I have one job, and that is
411888 413890 to make sure that you do not<br />drown your talents
413923 415392 at the bottom<br />of a bottle of pills, Lydia.
416159 418094 Please...
418128 419828 just to get through today.
424234 425535 Okay. But...
425568 427270 this is the last time
427304 429039 that I ever dig pills<br />out of a trash can for you.
429072 431274 Do you understand?<br />Or a toilet or sink.
432908 433909 Here.
436612 438514 Okay? You got this.
438547 439548 -All right?<br />-Yeah.
444219 446455 -Is that mine?<br />-Don't move.
446488 448424 Who's texting me?
448457 450092 Your stupid stepmother.
451160 452494 She's got texting diarrhea.
454630 455863 I have to go.
455898 457433 Lydia...
457466 459234 we still have<br />a segment to finish.
470378 471946 <i>Tell us about</i>
471979 473915 <i>the inspiration</i><br /><i>for The Human Canvas.</i>
473948 475116 <i>I am my own canvas.</i>
476084 477552 <i>I am my art.</i>
477585 480922 <i>As we know,</i><br /><i>art imitates the living.</i>
480955 482423 <i>It feeds me.</i>
482457 485026 <i>And I was not getting</i><br /><i>enough nourishment</i>
485059 486994 <i>from the sculpture alone.</i>
487028 489664 <i>So, I decided</i><br /><i>to broaden my tastes</i>
489697 491999 <i>and it turns out</i><br /><i>I am insatiably...</i>
492033 493134 Delia!
493167 494569 Where have you been?
494602 496403 I think I've cried all<br />the water out of my body.
496436 498105 What happened to Dad?
498138 500474 I'm <i>desolee,</i> Le Tigre!
500507 502976 He is the Picasso<br />of graffiti artists.
503009 505278 He was tagging me like<br />the walls of the Paris Métro.
505312 507247 But now he's having<br />a <i>petite</i> tantrum
507280 508982 because I had to cancel<br />the performance.
509015 510283 What happened?
511017 512419 What? Oh.
514488 516256 Your father's left me.
516289 517624 He's divorcing you?
517657 520127 What a horrible thought.
520160 521261 No! He's dead!
522195 523997 What?
524030 525399 Daddy's passed away.
528067 529201 How?
530669 532071 He was returning
532104 533539 from his bird-watching<br />expedition
533572 535074 to the Funafuti Atoll...
537176 538511 <i>...when his plane</i><br /><i>went down</i>
538544 540079 <i>in the South Pacific.</i>
544717 546218 A plane crash?
549555 551690 <i>That was</i><br /><i>his worst nightmare.</i>
553626 555261 Actually,<br />he survived the crash.
555294 557395 -He drowned?<br />-Almost.
557429 559998 But not quite, no.<br />According to survivors,
560031 561166 Daddy clung onto a wing.
562667 564235 - Over here!<br />- Come on!
564269 566504 Hey, swim over!<br />Swim over!
566538 567539 Hey!
568540 570341 So, how did he die?
570375 572043 A shark jumped out of the water
572076 573044 <i>and got him!</i>
574245 575380 Just like that.
576681 579050 I just spoke to him<br />on Saturday.
579083 580318 He was so excited,
580351 582454 he thanked me<br />for the binoculars,
582487 584722 he said he had observed<br />the mating rituals
584756 586491 of the Tuamotu sandpiper.
586524 588492 Yes, he flew halfway<br />around the world
588525 590160 to watch birds<br />do it on a beach.
590194 591195 And it killed him!
592763 594665 We need to tell Astrid.
595666 597534 Oh. Must we?
597568 599336 She's already<br />such a morbid little thing.
599369 600671 That's if I can even reach her.
600704 603040 We're barely on speaking terms.
603073 604341 Oh, it would kill Charles<br />to know
604374 606677 I had to cancel my show.
606710 607978 <i>Bonne journée a jamais!</i>
609246 610380 What'd he say?
618655 619689 Did you see that?
644514 646415 <i>Bonjour, monsieur. Ou suis-je?</i>
647483 649619 Where am I?
649652 653288 Down the hall,<br />second door on the right.
653321 655090 Take a number.
655123 656424 Someone will help you.
657526 659094 Eventually.
661763 663732 Goddamn foreigners.

826790 828926 Don't make me tell you twice.
832930 835231 Where is Beetlejuice?
854316 860389 Ugh.
875803 877973 Ghost House!
878006 879307 When you're all<br />on your third kid
879340 881275 and second divorce,
881309 882543 we'll see who gets<br />the last laugh.
890418 891419 Perfect.
896324 897592 Leave me alone.
909703 913007 So it's settled. We'll bring<br />Charles home to Winter River.
913040 914641 But I've never<br />hosted a funeral...
914674 915742 I've never hosted anything
915776 917544 without Charles standing there.
917577 919479 Watching me. In awe.
919513 921082 <i>It's Astrid.</i>
921115 922716 <i>- Please don't leave a message.</i><br />- She won't pick up.
922749 924785 Maybe I should tell Astrid<br />about Charles.
925786 927021 Might be easier coming from
927054 928755 a non-feminine<br />masculine archetype.
928789 931525 Well, there aren't any men<br />left in the family.
931558 933859 Well, no offense taken, Delia.
933894 935661 I'll be a member of the family<br />soon enough.
936963 938531 In fact,
938564 940000 I might be the perfect person<br />to tell her.
940033 942468 Having just lost<br />my own grandfather.
942501 944436 You did? When?
944470 946106 Forty years ago.
946139 949642 But in my child body,<br />that's yesterday.
949675 951111 I'm gonna<br />tell Astrid, okay?
951144 952678 Just give me a few minutes<br />before you come up.
952711 954380 Enough!<br />I'll handle this.
956816 957817 Astrid!
959953 960954 Astrid!
961888 962989 Astrid!
964389 967392 Stop torturing your mother.
967425 969360 I know I usually find it funny,
969394 970829 and only fair<br />after the way she treated me
970863 972363 when she was your age.
972397 973765 But not today!
974934 977669 Your mummy's lost her daddy.
977702 978904 You've lost your grandpa.
980039 981840 And I've lost my...
981874 983374 horny handyman.
984542 985543 Charles.
986444 987846 Charles!
988713 991449 Oh, Charles!
994053 996955 Can't believe Grandpa is dead.
996988 999090 He's like the only semi-normal<br />person in this family.
999123 1001458 We're gonna be in<br />Winter River for a few weeks.
1001491 1002894 What do you mean<br />for a few weeks?
1002927 1004394 I thought we were just<br />going for the funeral.
1004428 1005796 Well, we need to clear out<br />the house.
1005829 1007397 Grandpa loved that place.
1007431 1008933 Yes, and we are going<br />to honor him
1008967 1010969 with a Grief Collective.
1011002 1012871 A "Grief Collective"?
1012904 1018408 I am seeing a semi-multimedia<br />visual manifesto of our loss.
1018442 1019776 What does loss look like?
1019810 1022679 Is it just tears? A headstone?
1022713 1024048 Wilting gladioli?
1024082 1027550 No, we need to unpack<br />the art of sorrow.
1028986 1031420 Yeah, that sounds<br />really traumatic.
1031454 1032521 I can't go.
1032555 1034091 I'm our school rep
1034124 1035825 for our Student Environmental<br />Conference next week.
1035859 1037526 We're presenting our demands<br />on climate change action.
1037560 1039897 I spoke with the principal,<br />and they cleared it.
1039930 1042199 She actually thinks<br />it's a really good idea.
1042232 1044134 Yeah, well, I guess when you<br />donate an entire art center,
1044167 1045969 the principal becomes your<br />little puppet on a string.
1047603 1049472 Well, you're free<br />to reject your inheritance
1049505 1051607 when you're living high<br />off a tree hugger's salary.
1054945 1057545 What? No! No!
1060615 1061750 Jesus! Okay,<br />people already know
1061783 1063551 that Lydia Deetz is my mom.
1063585 1066588 Okay, can you stop being<br />a freak for, like, one second?
1066621 1068991 -Go back.<br />-Why?
1069025 1070659 All right, people already know<br />you'd rather spend
1070692 1072427 more time with ghosts<br />than your own daughter.
1104960 1107028 Jesus, Bob.
1107062 1108829 Can't you see<br />I'm concentrating here?
1109596 1110966 You know, Bob,
1110999 1113567 long distance relationships<br />can be difficult.
1113600 1115170 Especially when<br />one of you is dead
1115203 1116837 and the other's ignoring you<br />for 30 years.
1116871 1118173 But Lydia and I,
1118206 1120074 we have a definite<br />psychic connection.
1120107 1121708 <i>I just need</i><br /><i>these people out of my house.</i>
1121741 1124610 Please hold! Afterlife<br />Call Center, please hold.
1124644 1126846 <i>How much</i><br /><i>for a premium bio exorcism?</i>
1126880 1128182 And I'll tell ya something,
1128215 1129883 she definitely saw me<br />that last time.
1131251 1132752 I felt a little tingle.
1132785 1134021 <i>The money back</i><br /><i>guarantee one.</i>
1134054 1135956 I'm putting your call<br />through now.
1135990 1137557 <i>I've just died,</i><br /><i>and she's already remarried.</i>
1137590 1139193 Sell him the honeymoon package.
1139226 1140827 I'll kill the new husband,<br />and I'll possess the ex-wife.
1140861 1142296 I'll make her<br />do some unseemly things,
1142329 1143931 and then I'll post the pics.
1143964 1145232 <i>Can I pay</i><br /><i>in installments?</i>
1150937 1152238 I'm needed upstairs.
1152271 1154673 Bob, hold down the fort.
1163749 1165018 <i>Ou je suis?</i>
1165051 1166252 - Where am I?<br />- Take a number,
1166285 1167519 take a seat.
1177163 1179932 I'm more of a dog person.
1179966 1182267 You! Room 515. Now.
1188073 1189341 -Come on.<br />-Come on.
1189374 1190808 Hey,<br />easy with the suit.
1190841 1191842 Don't "Detective" me,
1191877 1193078 you walking disaster.
1193111 1194678 -We got reports.<br />-Another protestor.
1194712 1195981 <i>There is a ten-o-nine.</i>
1196014 1200185 Wolf Jackson,<br />Afterlife Crime Unit.
1201053 1202553 Let me take a wild stab.
1202988 1204022 Actor.
1204056 1206324 Not just any actor.
1206358 1209794 I've done it all.<br />For six movies and a reboot,
1209827 1212030 I became Frank Hardballer.
1212064 1214331 Doing my own stunts<br />was non-negotiable.
1214365 1216233 -You know why?<br />-Authenticity.
1216267 1217868 Correct.
1217902 1220204 A vice cop doesn't<br />get to a perp's door
1220237 1223773 and then call for some hambone<br />stunt man to break it down.
1223807 1225376 Neither did I.
1225409 1227078 You gotta keep it real.
1227111 1228778 Looks like you got a little<br />too real there, bud.
1231148 1232349 Who knew it was a live grenade?
1233150 1234385 Your name came up
1234418 1236987 on this case I'm investigating.
1241425 1243094 Recognize this puss?
1245195 1247030 Never seen that chick<br />before in my life.
1247063 1248131 Or afterlife.
1252235 1255004 Any idea
1255038 1256873 why my suspect wrote your name
1256906 1258774 in this schmo's goo?
1258807 1262644 Uh... Hard to say, Wolf,<br />but could be a super-fan.
1262678 1264247 You know,<br />guys like you and me...
1264280 1266349 ...we drive the gals crazy.
1266382 1268318 She collected<br />all her body parts.
1268351 1271787 My hunch<br />is she's out for revenge.
1271820 1275125 And you seem to be <i>numero uno</i><br />on her hit list.
1275158 1276358 Well, wouldn't be<br />the first woman
1276391 1277825 who wanted to kill me.
1277860 1279862 And kinda hard<br />to kill a dead guy.
1279895 1281096 This gal can.
1281130 1282931 She's a soul sucker.
1282965 1284665 Oh, yeah,<br />you could say that again.
1286135 1288803 My advice, lay low.
1288836 1291739 She gets her hands on you<br />and you're dead-dead.
1291772 1294675 And there's no coming back<br />from that, Mr. Juice.
1294709 1295810 Roger that.

1348428 1351031 I just don't believe<br />I won't see Charles again.
1351064 1352499 Be comforted in the knowledge
1352532 1355001 that he's in<br />a far better place.
1355035 1357370 Angels are guiding him<br />towards everlasting light
1357404 1360073 and may his soul fly through<br />the heavenly gates,
1360106 1362008 like the birds<br />that he so adored
1362042 1363842 and soar over<br />the Fields of Elysium
1363877 1365345 to the glory that is thine.
1366313 1367347 What?
1375421 1377323 I haven't been to a funeral<br />since Dad's.
1378290 1379491 Death is hard.
1381360 1383195 Yeah, sometimes<br />I think life is harder.
1384330 1385397 I know.
1387399 1390436 Listen, if you wanna talk<br />to that therapist again...
1390469 1391470 There you go again.
1392538 1394039 You just sidestep
1394073 1395207 every possible<br />conversation about him.
1396175 1397176 Astrid...
1398077 1399811 I loved your father,
1399844 1402046 but our relationship was over
1402080 1403915 a long time<br />before the accident.
1405483 1407218 I still don't understand<br />why you can't see him.
1411356 1413057 -Why not?<br />-I wish I knew.
1414058 1415426 But this ability
1415460 1417295 didn't exactly<br />come with instructions.
1418529 1420865 It all started<br />when I was your age.
1420898 1422533 It's ironic, isn't it?
1422567 1424135 You can apparently<br />see any random ghost
1424168 1425536 for your shitty TV show,
1425570 1426871 but the one ghost<br />that actually matters to me
1426904 1428273 you can't see at all.
1448558 1450093 We are closed!
1450127 1452996 I'm sorry to bother you.<br />My name's Charles Deetz.
1453030 1455098 I'm feeling<br />a little lightheaded.
1455132 1456333 Where am I?
1456366 1458068 Damn newbies.
1458101 1460237 You wait! In waiting room!
1461204 1463239 All right.
1463272 1465341 Unbelievable.
1474283 1475885 Hey...
1475918 1477219 who's there?
1532473 1535342 -My ex-wife is back.<br />-Hmm?
1535376 1537478 Well, I know<br />what you're thinking...
1537511 1541048 "When was the Juice<br />ever tied down?
1541081 1544418 What kind of woman could ever<br />keep him satisfied?" Well...
1650453 1652422 <i>Mazel tov.</i>
1679482 1681417 Now she's back,
1681451 1682584 and she's pissed.
1712781 1713781 Hey.
1715851 1718052 Must be pretty<br />noisy up here. Yeah?
1719253 1720354 In here, too.
1722456 1724759 Listen, if you ever<br />need to process
1724792 1726694 any of your emotions,<br />I'm here for you.
1730331 1733167 Emotions processed. Thanks.
1733200 1735670 I saw you standing<br />at your grandfather's grave.
1737371 1738506 He must have been<br />a pretty dope dude.
1741275 1742777 Death is so, like...
1744277 1748114 It's, like, tragic,<br />you know?
1748148 1751284 I mean, if you ever wanna,<br />you know, cry or just,
1751318 1752752 kind of rage against<br />some of these feelings
1752786 1754654 that you have going on<br />in there,
1754688 1756122 I want you to know
1756156 1758358 that I could be that...
1758391 1761394 kinda dope dad-dude for you.<br />You know?
1763663 1764899 -I'm good.<br />-You know,
1764932 1766132 times like this<br />can bring a family
1766166 1768268 weirdly closer together.
1768301 1769703 On the way over here,
1769736 1771438 I wrote a poem<br />for your grandpa.
1771471 1773673 Oh, did you? How does it go?
1775407 1777543 It's, it's, it's...
1777576 1779278 it starts...
1779311 1781915 It, well, it kinda like<br />opens on grief. Obviously.
1781948 1784717 And then acceptance.
1784750 1786886 It's long. I didn't memorize it<br />or anything like that,
1786920 1788621 but it's quite beautiful.
1788654 1790489 Cut the crap, Rory.
1790522 1792524 All right? I'm not falling<br />for your New Age,
1792558 1794426 overly emotional,<br />trauma bonding,
1794460 1795761 yoga retreat bullshit.
1796528 1797529 I see you.
1798564 1799732 Because, like you,
1799765 1802735 my mom is a very broken person.
1802768 1804536 Okay?<br />She's a delusional fantasist.
1805671 1806872 You just exploit her.
1806905 1808239 And if she wants<br />to allow that to happen,
1808272 1809273 that's on her.
1819250 1820853 I'm so sorry<br />for your loss. I'm sorry.
1820886 1823454 I know, I know. Thank you.
1823488 1826591 Oh, if it isn't<br />little Jane Butterfield.
1826624 1828226 Littler Jane?
1828259 1829560 Oh, it's Jane Butterfield-Lee<br />now.
1829594 1830828 We hyphenated.
1830863 1831864 Is that Maxie Dean?
1833297 1834465 No.
1834499 1835733 No one's here yet.
1838235 1839837 Sample from<br />my hubby's microbrewery.
1839871 1843440 "Micro"? Is that for people<br />with tiny houses?
1843473 1846710 Why is your house<br />covered in black fabric?
1846743 1848779 It's a mourning shroud.
1848812 1851748 Now that Charles is dead,<br />so also dies this house.
1851782 1854584 And I'm protecting it<br />in its transition.
1854618 1857487 To a new life<br />with a new family.
1857521 1858890 I can't wait to show it.
1858923 1860590 Buyers are already lining up.
1860624 1862325 Thanks to you, Lydia,
1862359 1864528 everyone wants a piece<br />of the original Ghost House.
1864561 1865997 Ghosts aren't real.
1866030 1868498 Only gullible people<br />believe that kind of crap.
1868532 1869966 Unless you're trying to pay<br />the bills, right, Mom?
1870000 1871835 Okay, honey, in we go.
1873469 1875271 Can I have<br />everyone's attention, please?
1875304 1876305 What?
1876338 1877707 We're gathered here today
1877740 1881377 to celebrate the life<br />of an extraordinary man.
1881410 1882545 Now, I only had the pleasure
1882578 1884246 of meeting Charles a few times.
1884280 1886515 Then I can tell you<br />he didn't want any speeches.
1886549 1889285 Charles hated<br />public displays of emotion.
1889318 1892521 Yeah, but he also...
1892555 1894590 chose to live his life<br />to the fullest.
1894623 1897793 I'm going to tear a page<br />out of Charles Deetz's book.
1897827 1899628 Lydia,
1899662 1900795 now, I know<br />we had always agreed
1900829 1901830 to take<br />our relationship slowly.
1901864 1903465 But I can't wait any longer.
1903498 1906468 Let's get married<br />on your favorite holiday.
1906501 1908470 Will you marry me on Halloween?
1908503 1909704 - Good Lord!<br />- Uh...
1910873 1912474 That's... That's in two days!
1912507 1913742 Yes, I know.
1913775 1914709 I've already spoken<br />to Father Damien.
1914743 1916311 The church is available.
1916344 1917645 The Lord's sanctuary<br />welcomes all who seek
1917679 1919447 salvation<br />and everlasting glory.
1919481 1922484 Just not before noon,<br />and between three and four.
1922517 1924819 You're seriously doing this<br />at Charles' wake?
1925820 1928723 Yes. Yes. Yes, because...
1930025 1932026 because as we stand here,
1932060 1934028 surrounded by death...
1934062 1936630 ...let us all make<br />a commitment to choose life.
1936663 1937866 Because I want to spend
1937899 1938967 the rest of my life<br />with you, Lydia.
1940768 1941836 And you, Delia.
1943570 1945372 And you too.
1945405 1946875 And you. Again.
1947708 1948709 What do you say?
1950444 1951645 Rory, I... Come on,
1951678 1953781 I can't commit to this<br />right now.
1956416 1957886 Oh.
1958685 1959888 All right.
1962890 1964657 This is too much loss.
1964690 1965926 What do you mean?
1965959 1967527 Well, first,<br />the death of Charles.
1967560 1968996 And of course,<br />the death of my grandfather,
1969029 1970630 which you know about.<br />And now the death of...
1972598 1974767 -us.<br />-No! No, I...
1974801 1976569 Come on, I didn't mean that.
1976602 1978105 Thought you wanted to take<br />life's great big bungee jump
1978138 1979372 right beside me.
1979405 1981074 No safety nets, right?
1981108 1982708 But I guess,
1982742 1984677 the only thing<br />bungee jumping today is love.
1984710 1987380 And that cord just snapped.
1987413 1989348 Come on. Rory...
1989382 1991450 -I love you.<br />-And I love you.
1993686 1995520 Oh.
1995554 1996755 What are we waiting for?
1998723 2000392 Okay, I guess.
2003628 2004763 Oh, my God.
2009001 2010036 She said "yes"!
2012104 2013105 She said "yes"!
2014806 2016042 Astrid!

2106963 2107964 Are you okay?
2115138 2117173 Are you okay?<br />What happened?
2117206 2120108 Yeah. I'll live.
2121676 2122743 Uh, what are you reading?
2123912 2125713 <i>Crime and Punishment.</i>
2125746 2127515 -One of those.<br />-"One of those"?
2127548 2128984 What does that mean?
2129017 2131019 Nothing.<br />I've read it three times.
2131053 2133554 -Did you really?<br />-Yeah.
2133587 2135157 "Pain and suffering<br />are always inevitable."
2135190 2136158 Yes.
2136191 2138060 Yeah, I...
2138093 2141529 I can't believe you're quoting<br />Dostoevsky. That's...
2141562 2142931 Where have you been<br />all my life?
2147768 2149804 So, how long have<br />you been in Winter River?
2149838 2151072 My whole life.
2151105 2152772 I've never seen you<br />around before.
2152806 2154574 Yeah, this is just<br />a temporary layover
2154607 2155876 for my grandpa's funeral.
2157211 2158778 Until my mom's janky fiance
2158812 2161182 turned it into<br />a de facto engagement party.
2161215 2162649 Yeah, he announced<br />their wedding date.
2163650 2166653 Wow. That's different.
2166686 2167955 Oh, yeah.<br />If you knew my mom,
2167989 2169256 that's actually<br />pretty on-brand for her.
2170757 2172492 Is your dad<br />in the picture or...
2173760 2174761 No.
2176130 2177564 Yeah, he was a free spirit.
2178598 2180234 Defender of hopeless causes.
2180267 2182668 When they split,<br />he went to Brazil.
2182701 2184037 He was trying<br />to save the rainforest.
2185704 2186973 But my mom grew up here.
2187007 2188640 That old house on the hill.
2189843 2190944 Wait. The Ghost House?
2192012 2193545 Is your mom Lydia Deetz?
2194247 2195281 Unfortunately.
2195315 2196983 She's a legend.
2197017 2199019 Well, yeah, if you believe<br />in supernatural bullshit.
2199953 2200954 You don't?
2202654 2204224 -No.<br />-Mmm-hmm.
2204257 2205959 I only believe in things<br />that I can see.
2205992 2207793 You know, science. Facts.
2210163 2211730 Oh.
2211764 2213798 Yeah, it's gonna keep going.
2213832 2216168 Back to the insanity.
2216201 2218569 I'm sorry about your fence,<br />by the way.
2218603 2220072 You can tell your parents<br />my mom will pay for that.
2220105 2222274 Nah, that's okay. It's...<br />They won't even notice.
2223909 2228013 Uh... Well, listen,<br />I'll be here tomorrow,
2228047 2231716 if you want a break<br />from the insanity.
2265950 2267251 Witness confirmed our suspect
2267285 2269353 as the soul sucker<br />from Lost and Found.
2269387 2270620 Wanna hear<br />the weird part, chief?
2270654 2271956 Hit me.
2271989 2273024 After she turned the owner
2273057 2275093 into a human pancake,
2275126 2276960 she stole a wedding dress<br />from the conveyor.
2276993 2279728 Of course.<br />This stapled sicko...
2279762 2281064 has her twisted heart set
2281098 2284800 on a romantic reunion<br />with Mr. Juice.
2284835 2286269 She won't stop killing,
2286303 2289206 until she walks him<br />back down the aisle.
2291374 2295644 Cases like this make me wonder<br />why I even became a cop.
2298215 2299950 You're not a cop.<br />You're an actor.
2300884 2301885 Thank you, Janet.
2302919 2304254 You keep me real.
2304287 2305754 Should we take<br />this Beetlejuice
2305788 2307022 into protective custody?
2307056 2308290 See if you can find him.
2308324 2309892 He's probably laying low.
2309925 2311994 Scared out of his mind.
2317867 2319969 A little higher, boys.
2320002 2321904 We can't let Delores<br />get through that door.
2329145 2330712 Bob.
2330745 2331779 Like lookin' in a mirror.
2333315 2335351 You see, Bob,<br />you'd serve as my decoy.
2335384 2337086 You'd walk in front of me<br />at all times.
2337119 2340355 That way she'd suck your soul<br />while I make my getaway.
2341788 2343258 <i>¿Comprende?</i>
2355503 2357105 Now's my chance.
2369216 2370817 What?
2370851 2372352 Why?
2372386 2374955 No! No! No!
2374988 2376456 Delia, what's wrong?
2376490 2378091 I'm trying to capture<br />the perfect primal scream.
2378125 2379893 I'm gonna blow it up,<br />mount it on the wall,
2379927 2382129 and I invite all of you<br />to do the same.
2382162 2383997 -Why?<br />-For the Collective.
2384031 2386033 We cannot sincerely celebrate
2386066 2388734 all that was good<br />about our dearly departed.
2388768 2390736 Not until we release the horror
2390770 2392105 that they inflicted upon us.
2392139 2394740 What awful thing<br />did Grandpa ever do to you?
2394774 2397311 He bought this house<br />without telling me.
2399980 2402348 Oh, my God!
2402381 2404183 I was helpfully getting<br />some boxes in town,
2404217 2405885 then I heard you screaming.<br />Are you all right?
2405918 2407786 It was Delia.
2407820 2409188 Oh, Delia.
2409222 2410423 I'm good.
2411290 2412525 Ignore her.
2412558 2414293 That was very<br />thoughtful of you.
2414327 2416462 Astrid, can you give him<br />a hand with the boxes?
2418264 2419798 I told the movers to come<br />a week from today. All right?
2419832 2421100 I think that'll give us all<br />time to get over
2421133 2422902 our grief and our trauma.
2422935 2424136 And then, after the wedding,<br />I think we should go back,
2424170 2425871 and we gotta<br />finish those shows.
2425905 2427139 Maybe Mom can get<br />the ghosts in the attic
2427173 2428841 to give us a hand.
2428874 2432010 Adam and Barbara Maitland.<br />They're not here anymore.
2432043 2433777 Why? They find<br />a better house to haunt?
2433811 2436414 No, we found a loophole,<br />and they moved on.
2437282 2438917 How convenient.
2508918 2509919 Ew.
2557598 2559333 Oh.
2559367 2561168 God, I thought I lost those.
2563170 2567208 That was taken at an all-night<br />Mario Bava horror fest.
2567241 2569910 I was nine months<br />pregnant with you.
2569944 2572279 My water broke during<br /><i>Kill, Baby... Kill!</i>
2574014 2575216 Dad's favorite movie.
2575249 2576283 Yeah.
2576317 2577318 Can I keep this?
2578352 2580121 Yeah.
2580154 2582022 I really like that model<br />of Winter River, too.
2582957 2584392 Did Grandpa make that?
2584425 2587294 No, that belonged<br />to the Maitlands.
2587328 2589929 You know,<br />the non-existent ghost couple.
2598705 2600373 Oh, I found that on the floor.
2600407 2603576 -Hey, who's Beetlejuice?<br />-Don't ever say that name!
2603610 2605278 Not ever!
2605311 2607514 -Beetlejuice.<br />-No! Astrid, I'm serious.
2607547 2610116 If you say that name<br />three times, really bad stuff
2610150 2611484 -is gonna happen.<br />-Like what?
2611518 2613486 In fact,<br />this attic is off-limits.
2613520 2615155 Do you understand me?
2615188 2616423 Yeah, I understand<br />that you're crazy.
2632237 2633539 Oh, my God, it's you!
2633572 2635974 I thought a moose<br />was about to attack me.
2636008 2638210 It's breathing exercises.
2638243 2639945 Try seeing ghosts every day.
2641280 2642314 Astrid!
2643415 2644450 Let her be.
2644483 2646185 God, she hates me.
2648187 2650721 Somehow, Richard's<br />death is still my fault.
2650755 2652657 You blamed me<br />for your mother's.
2652690 2654392 She's not dead.
2654425 2657428 And I didn't blame you.<br />I resented you.
2657462 2658563 There's a difference.
2658596 2660164 You weren't very nice.
2660198 2662667 No, you barely acknowledged<br />my existence.
2662700 2664535 But we've done all right,<br />haven't we?
2664569 2667605 Yeah. Ever since I sold out<br />and got famous,
2667638 2669040 we have gotten closer.
2669073 2670641 No, I started liking you<br />before that.
2675580 2677181 Again with<br />the creepy breathing!
2677215 2679016 It works!
2679050 2681118 I learned it at the survivors'<br />retreat, where I met Rory.
2681152 2682486 Of course you did.
2682519 2684454 Look, I was in shock<br />after Richard died.
2684488 2686523 And I was working on<br />my unresolved feelings,
2686556 2688425 and Rory had just lost<br />his fiancee
2688458 2689693 in a skiing accident,
2689726 2692095 and we were<br />in the same sorrow circle
2692128 2693663 and we connected.
2693697 2695499 Yeah.
2695532 2697701 He was turned on by you at<br />the lowest point in your life.
2697734 2699603 Okay, but this isn't about him.
2699636 2701538 Astrid found this in the attic.
2701571 2703340 Ew. So?
2703773 2705509 So?
2705542 2707744 Every now and then<br />I feel his presence.
2707777 2709312 Like he's lurking somewhere,
2709346 2710780 just out of reach.
2710815 2712215 But lately,
2712249 2713749 I'm seeing him again.
2713782 2716252 And I was really hoping<br />this was all in my head.
2716285 2717620 But now this?
2717653 2719688 Lydia, you need<br />to take back your life.
2719722 2722691 From the hanger-onners,<br />from this thing.
2722725 2724326 Where's the obnoxious<br />little goth girl
2724360 2726362 who tormented me<br />all those years ago?
2727263 2728797 It's time to find her.
2743312 2744546 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
2750552 2752587 - Jeremy, is that you?<br />- Yeah.
2752620 2754756 Uh, Mom, I'm just gonna<br />be upstairs with a friend.
2754789 2756157 Okay. Have fun.
2760896 2762330 - Hey, Dad.<br />- Son.
2762363 2764465 Stuck on...<br />He lives in that room.
2775475 2777778 You've got a lot of '90s vinyl.
2777812 2778880 Where are you<br />finding this, eBay?
2778913 2781849 No, I troll old record stores.
2781883 2783784 I don't trust<br />what I can't touch.
2789857 2791358 <i>Handbook for</i><br /><i>the Recently Deceased.</i>
2791391 2793627 Yeah, I got that<br />at a yard sale in town.
2793660 2796296 The illustrations<br />are pretty gnarly.
2796330 2797899 Yeah, looks like<br />the kinda crappy book
2797932 2799132 my mom would write.
2800500 2801735 What's the deal<br />with your parents?
2801768 2804371 Well, my mom spends<br />every waking hour
2804404 2807139 in the kitchen stress-baking.
2807173 2809475 And my dad used to work<br />at the paper mill,
2809508 2811177 but then he had an accident,
2811210 2814180 so now he's a full-time<br />couch potato.
2814213 2816515 I can't wait to get out<br />of this shitty town.
2818451 2821153 Um, you must have been<br />to a lot of places
2821187 2823422 traveling, with a famous mom.
2823456 2825358 Not really.
2825391 2827226 My dad's<br />more the traveler anyway.
2827259 2828294 We used to have this big plan
2828327 2829629 where we were gonna visit
2829662 2831330 the top ten<br />creepiest places on Earth.
2831364 2834567 So, Tower of London<br />and Dracula's Castle and...
2834600 2837636 yeah, then we never<br />got the chance to do it.
2838470 2839537 What happened?
2840538 2842741 A boat accident.
2842774 2844509 Yeah, they searched<br />the Amazon for a week,
2844542 2845777 and they never found his body.
2849547 2850582 You really miss him.
2852651 2854319 Yeah.
2854352 2855654 You know,<br />I at least would have liked
2855687 2857422 to have gotten the chance<br />to say goodbye.
2857455 2858757 But can't your mom,
2858790 2860458 I don't know, like,
2860492 2862828 contact him or...
2862862 2864229 She claims<br />she can't even see him.
2864262 2866231 -Why not?<br />-Because she's a fraud.
2866264 2868900 Well, I think<br />that's a little harsh.
2870601 2872837 Uh, well, tomorrow's Halloween.
2872871 2876206 I know. Used to be<br />my favorite holiday.
2876240 2878308 Because my dad,<br />he would go all out
2878342 2879978 and make the most<br />age-inappropriate costumes.
2880011 2881779 Yeah, I think I was
2881813 2884214 in second grade when I went<br />as Munch's <i>The Scream.</i>
2884248 2886885 -Wow. Yeah.<br />-Yeah. It was a choice.
2886918 2888385 But now my mom's<br />getting married that day,
2888419 2889653 so I don't know,
2889687 2891455 probably be<br />my least favorite now.
2891488 2892623 Well, what time's the wedding?
2892656 2894859 Midnight. The witching hour.
2894893 2896727 Future stepdad's lame idea.
2898328 2901264 Well, why don't you<br />come over...
2902331 2903332 earlier?
2904500 2906302 Uh, we could,
2906335 2910306 I don't know, we could order<br />pizza and give out candy.
2911975 2915211 Only if you want to.<br />I mean that's, that's no...
2915778 2917246 no pressure.
2920984 2923887 What is up<br />with these creepy birds?
2923921 2926255 Bird-watching<br />was my dad's passion.
2926289 2928291 Oh, I contacted<br />that vintage shop
2928324 2930027 you love in SoHo.
2930060 2932527 They've sent a few<br />potential wedding dresses.
2932561 2934296 Should be here later today.
2934329 2935630 Ooh, great. Thanks.
2937399 2938801 And a, uh,
2938835 2941269 little bird may have<br />chirped our big news
2941303 2943371 to a few news outlets.
2943405 2945674 Thought we could<br />sell the photos exclusively.
2945707 2947442 Could be great press<br />for the show.
2947476 2950046 I... Look, I'm really excited<br />about tying the knot,
2950079 2953582 but can we just keep it<br />small and private?
2953615 2955918 Yeah. Well, sure.
2955952 2956953 It's your big day.
2957686 2958855 Night. Whatever.
2960990 2962723 <i>Yo, I've got fevers running</i>
2962757 2964492 <i>all through me. All through me!</i>
2970098 2971298 Lydia?
2972600 2974970 I want you out of my life!
2975003 2976004 Do you hear me?
2976737 2977738 Lydia?
2979340 2982043 Who are you yelling at?
2982077 2984512 Do you remember that<br />couples therapist that we saw,
2984545 2985881 -Dr. Glickman?<br />-Mmm.
2985914 2987681 He said that I was holding<br />something back
2987715 2990085 and until I faced it,<br />you and I wouldn't evolve.
2990118 2992720 -Mmm.<br />-Okay, well, he was right.
2992753 2994989 And I'm going to tell you now.
2995022 2996090 And, fair warning,
2996123 2998859 it's gonna sound batshit crazy.
2998893 3001394 Are you okay with that?
3001427 3002796 Of course. I'd love to.
3002830 3004597 Let's break through<br />this barrier together.
3004631 3006399 Okay, just give me a sec.
3010104 3011704 When I was a teenager,
3011738 3015042 a trickster demon<br />terrorized my entire family
3015075 3016776 and tried to force me<br />to marry him,
3016811 3019980 in order to come back<br />to the real world for good.
3020014 3022582 I believed he was gone forever,
3022615 3024852 and then lately,<br />I have been seeing him again.
3024884 3027586 And now, he is actually back.
3027619 3031024 And I don't know why,<br />or how, or what to do.
3033759 3035661 Okay, so you're saying that<br />someone called Beetlejuice...
3035694 3037063 Don't say his name!
3037096 3038998 If you say his name<br />three times,
3039032 3040532 he will appear.
3042501 3045805 Okay. So this...
3045839 3048808 demon is clearly a construct<br />of your unpacked trauma.
3048842 3050442 It's trauma that<br />you're gonna need to face,
3050475 3051845 otherwise, it's just<br />gonna get worse.
3051878 3054948 He's not a construct.<br />He is literally a demon.
3056581 3058884 I know this<br />is a big step for you.
3058917 3060685 But in the words<br />of Dr. Glickman,
3060718 3062687 I'm gonna give you<br />the push you need.
3065023 3066490 Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,<br />Beetlejuice.
3074632 3076034 What just happened?
3076068 3077568 We're in the model.
3078469 3079838 That's not possible.
3083774 3084977 What the hell?
3085010 3086611 I told you not to say his name!
3090915 3092984 <i>Lydia Deetz,</i><br /><i>ladies and gentlemen!</i>
3093017 3094784 <i>Don't ever</i><br /><i>say that name.</i>
3094819 3097554 <i>Not ever!</i><br /><i>We need to leave, now.</i>
3097587 3099456 <i>Beetlejuice,</i><br /><i>Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.</i>
3101893 3103460 -Is that...<br />-Beetlejuice!
3107731 3109599 First of all,<br />I want you two kids to know,
3109633 3111501 this is a safe space. Okay?
3111534 3112904 Feel free<br />to express yourselves.
3112937 3114906 Don't be afraid. I sense<br />there's an enabler here,
3114939 3115973 but we'll get to that.
3116007 3117208 Look, dig deep
3117241 3118508 and spill your guts.
3118541 3119809 Okay? Who wants to go first?
3119843 3121443 Huh?
3121477 3122778 All right, I will.
3126682 3128717 There you go. See?<br />I'm willing to do the work.
3128751 3130220 You two kids<br />need to get in touch
3130253 3131888 with your inner child.
3131922 3133555 Mine'll be along<br />in just a jiffy.
3148972 3151240 Everybody says<br />he's got my eyes.
3151273 3154109 Personally, I don't see it.
3154143 3155811 Scram, kid.
3158780 3160015 You're just my unpacked trauma.
3160049 3161649 You're just my unpacked trauma.
3161683 3163618 You're a figment<br />of my imagination.
3163651 3164887 Really?
3164920 3166221 Is this a figment<br />of your imagination?
3172627 3174129 Leg man.
3174163 3175864 Just like his old man.
3183304 3185907 That was you stalking me.
3185940 3187175 Hey, if stalking means
3187208 3188910 trying to remarry<br />the love of my life,
3188943 3191245 well, I'm guilty as charged.<br />Come here!
3191279 3192947 Home, home, home!
3206828 3211966 <i>♪ Wherever you go</i><br /><i>Whatever you do ♪</i>
3212000 3217603 <i>♪ I will be right here</i><br /><i>Waiting for you ♪</i>
3219772 3220974 What happened?
3221008 3222909 I just had the wildest dream.
3224277 3226779 Yeah, I think<br />we should lay off the pills.
3235088 3236789 Snakes?
3236823 3238859 Actually, asps.
3238892 3240293 Aren't they beautiful?
3240327 3241895 Wedding gift for Rory?
3241928 3244864 Too late.<br />They've been defanged.
3244897 3246966 Guaranteed harmless,<br />and they're for me.
3247833 3249035 In Ancient Egypt,
3249068 3250602 a queen would perform<br />a ceremony
3250635 3252604 at the tomb of her pharaoh<br />using snakes,
3252637 3254706 the symbol of undying love.
3254739 3256075 -Are you sure about that?<br />-Mmm-hmm.
3256108 3257609 We read that<br />they were a constant threat
3257642 3258676 to Ra in the underworld
3258710 3259945 and represented total chaos.
3259979 3261147 Okay, see,<br />that's why schools need
3261180 3262915 more art and less reading.
3262948 3264783 You got your wish,<br />we're leaving.
3264817 3265885 So go pack up your things,
3265918 3267053 I'm driving you back to school.
3267086 3268586 Wait, what happened?
3268620 3270755 You wouldn't believe me<br />if I told you.
3270790 3272892 I will pay<br />for a fleet of movers
3272925 3274926 to take everything<br />back to Manhattan,
3274959 3276194 except that model.
3276227 3278595 We need to chop it up<br />and burn it.
3278629 3279964 Oh.
3279998 3282033 You're calling off the wedding?
3285870 3287172 What did that<br />cheese ball do now?
3287205 3288639 It's not Rory.
3288672 3289706 It's Beetlejuice.
3289740 3290842 He's here.
3290875 3292310 In the model. I saw him.
3292343 3294678 Rory saw him, too,<br />but he thinks it's a dream.
3294711 3295947 Wait,<br />we can't leave yet.
3297714 3300717 I have plans tomorrow<br />with this boy that I met.
3302921 3304923 How did you have time<br />to meet a boy?
3304956 3306356 You had time to get married.
3306390 3309059 She doesn't<br />mean it. It's just karma.
3309093 3310327 Whatever. I was biking
3310360 3312162 and then I kinda crashed<br />into his fence
3312196 3313997 and we started talking,
3314031 3315065 and then he invited me over<br />to his place for Halloween.
3317301 3318869 Can I go, Mom?
3318902 3320270 Mmm-mmm.
3320304 3321305 Please?
3324674 3327111 I will not allow<br />that menace to humanity
3327144 3329146 to upheave our family again.
3329179 3332416 No one goes in there,<br />no one calls his name!
3332449 3334318 We're gonna be fine, right?
3334351 3336920 Mom, come on!<br />I'm gonna be late.
3349932 3351400 Trick or treat!
3355938 3357240 Are you sure<br />this is the right address?
3357273 3358975 Yeah.
3359008 3360843 125 Jefferson Lane.
3360877 3362711 Don't judge... all right?
3362744 3364180 His dad just got<br />into an accident at work,
3364213 3365714 and they're going through<br />a rough patch.
3365747 3366983 Trick or treat!
3367016 3368017 He's cute.
3369251 3370718 What are you doing?
3370751 3372053 I was gonna go<br />say "hey" to his parents.
3372087 3374022 Seriously?<br />This isn't a playdate.
3374055 3375090 I mean,<br />we're not six years old.
3375123 3376158 Nothing's gonna happen.
3376191 3378326 All right, okay. You're right.
3378360 3381429 Have fun,<br />and I'll pick you up at 10:00.
3381463 3382898 Not a second later.
3386935 3387936 Come on, quick!
3390338 3391640 Trick or treat!
3409756 3412359 I, uh,<br />raided the basement.
3412393 3414795 I forgot we even<br />had half this stuff.
3414828 3415996 Yeah, you really went all out.
3416030 3417865 Yeah.
3417898 3419867 I like the James Dean costume,<br />by the way.
3419900 3420968 Thank you. But yeah,
3421001 3422503 my parents think<br />I look more like
3422536 3424338 Richie from <i>Happy Days.</i>
3424371 3426340 -Mmm?<br />-Your costume looks great.
3427408 3429176 Who are you supposed to be?
3429210 3430244 Marie Curie.
3432345 3434080 Two-time Nobel Prize-winning<br />French physicist
3434113 3435882 -and feminist icon.<br />-Oh, she was, uh,
3435915 3438151 she discovered radiation.<br />Right?
3438184 3439385 -Yeah.<br />-Yeah.
3439419 3440453 Yeah, her work was killing her.
3440486 3441888 She didn't even realize it.
3441921 3443990 Yeah, well,<br />for someone who is dying
3444023 3446159 of radiation poisoning,
3446192 3449829 uh, you look beautiful.
3449862 3453299 I brought some candy.<br />Or a lot of... I...
3453333 3454867 It's probably<br />too much actually.
3454901 3456402 But, uh, we can, I don't know,
3456436 3458404 maybe binge on whatever's<br />left over, if you want?
3458438 3460473 Or we could start<br />handing it out now,
3460506 3462108 if that's...
3462141 3463842 -what you wanna do.<br />-Yeah.
3463875 3466378 Uh, I have a confession,<br />actually.
3467980 3470983 I'd rather stay up here<br />with you.
3474353 3476388 Okay. Yeah.
3477322 3478323 That works, too.
3510921 3512957 Please don't freak out.
3512990 3513991 What are you?
3514959 3515960 Don't you know?
3517862 3520064 Astrid, really,<br />you don't have to be scared.
3522033 3523234 You're a ghost.
3527270 3529039 My mom was telling the truth.<br />Shit!
3529072 3530507 When my mom and dad<br />used to fight,
3530540 3532309 I used to steal<br />one of my dad's six-packs
3532342 3534344 and go hide out<br />in the tree fort.
3534377 3535378 And one day,
3537013 3538048 I slipped
3538081 3539082 and fell.
3540417 3541584 How long ago did that happen?
3541618 3544020 23 years, 5 months and 14 days.
3544054 3545455 But who's counting?
3545488 3546990 I've been stuck in this house<br />for 23 years.
3547023 3549926 I can't go any further<br />than that tree.
3549959 3553096 And I've just spent my time<br />watching the world go by.
3553129 3554597 But then you came along,
3554631 3555998 and you could see me.
3558033 3559535 And I've been on my own<br />for so long,
3559568 3561904 it was like a grenade<br />had gone off in my head.
3561937 3563005 It was amazing.
3563639 3564940 You're amazing.
3564973 3566542 -I should go.<br />-Astrid, I know.
3566575 3568043 I know it's insane.
3568077 3571246 But I really like you,
3571280 3573015 and I want us to be together.
3574316 3576051 How?
3576085 3578287 You're dead, I'm alive.<br />That doesn't make any sense.
3579388 3580956 Well, uh,
3580989 3582624 what if I told you
3582658 3584393 that I'd found a way<br />to come back.
3586095 3587462 To be human again.
3587495 3589564 Um, it's all in this book.
3589597 3591466 Uh, everyone gets one of these<br />when they die.
3591499 3592900 It's kind of complicated,
3592934 3595136 but, uh, I can only do it
3595169 3598973 with the help<br />of a living person.
3599006 3602009 And you could literally<br />give me my life back.
3602043 3604545 I don't know.<br />Maybe we could ask my mom?
3604579 3607181 'Cause she's supposed to be<br />the undead expert, right?
3607215 3608616 Yeah, well, I...
3608649 3611252 I'm sure she'll give you<br />a million reasons
3611285 3612620 to stay away.
3612653 3614455 But I'll give you one reason<br />to help me.
3616424 3618625 You'd get to see your dad.
3619493 3620560 Again.
3635108 3637010 I have the first<br />official open house
3637043 3638412 a week from Sunday,
3638445 3640280 and then we will let<br />the bidding war begin.
3640313 3641548 Where's Rory?
3641581 3643283 Supermarket.
3643316 3645318 Swapping out the candy<br />I bought for carrot sticks.
3645352 3647621 Because Rory loves<br />to fun-suck everything.
3647654 3649055 Even Halloween.
3649089 3651590 Gotta run.<br />See you at the church.
3651624 3654427 Oh. Unless you're calling off<br />the wedding?
3654460 3655461 No, Delia.
3656362 3657463 Where are you going?
3657496 3659064 Cemetery.
3659098 3661100 To commune<br />with my dear husband's spirit.
3663235 3665137 I need to skedaddle, too.
3665171 3666705 I'm co-chaperoning
3666739 3669408 Littler Jane's<br />Girl Scout troop.
3669442 3671677 We spent weeks coming up<br />with a group costume theme.
3671710 3674713 We agreed nothing Disney.
3674747 3676582 The closest<br />we ever got to Disney
3676615 3680519 was when Astrid dressed<br />as Cinderella's dead mom.
3680553 3682387 You'll never guess<br />what the girls came up with.
3682420 3684756 - Mmm?<br />- Fruit salad.
3684790 3686324 Isn't that genius?
3686357 3688259 It's healthy<br />and non-triggering.
3689160 3690161 I'm going as...
3692697 3694666 "reverse mortgage."
3694699 3696601 Which is "mortgage"<br />spelled backwards.
3697803 3699404 Where is Astrid?
3699437 3701773 On a date. Her first.
3701807 3704342 I think I'm more nervous<br />than she is.
3704375 3706077 The boy lives over<br />on Jefferson.
3706110 3708213 Don't mention that street.
3708246 3709280 I have a listing that's kept me
3709314 3711416 from a perfect sales record.
3711449 3713317 Oh, it's my own fault.
3713350 3715686 The place had been<br />on the market for years...
3715719 3718288 but I thought if I could sell<br />the "Murder House,"
3718322 3719690 it would be<br />a feather in my cap.
3719723 3721024 Murder House?
3721558 3722559 Which house?
3723627 3725496 125.
3725529 3727297 That's where<br />I dropped Astrid off.
3727331 3729066 She was seeing<br />a boy named Jeremy.
3729099 3732135 Jeremy Frazier?
3732169 3734171 I didn't get his last name.
3735239 3737040 Oh, no, it can't be him.
3737074 3740177 But Jeremy Frazier<br />was bad news.
3740210 3743513 Twenty-three years ago,<br />he murdered his parents.
3743546 3745515 The cops found him<br />hiding in his tree house.
3745548 3746582 When they tried to get him out,
3746616 3748584 he fell, broke his neck,
3748618 3750353 died instantly.
3755658 3758294 That's all you have to do<br />to get into the Afterlife?
3758327 3760496 Draw a door with some chalk?
3760530 3761798 Oh, and knock three times?
3761832 3763299 I'm just doing<br />what it says in there.
3763332 3764333 So lame.
3774877 3777112 Or maybe it's not so lame.
3777145 3778848 And what do we do?<br />We just walk through?
3778881 3780783 I can. But since<br />you're still alive,
3780816 3783151 you have to read<br />that incantation first.
3785420 3789157 <i>"De mundo</i><br /><i>vivorum audeo in iterum..."</i>
3805774 3806775 Astrid!
3812479 3814481 Jeremy, is that you?
3820454 3823324 <i>"Ut liber iterum</i><br /><i>ambulet alius."</i>
3824658 3826226 Okay.
3826260 3827695 I think that worked.
3828462 3829530 Astrid!
3832901 3834101 Let's go see your dad.
3837437 3839339 Astrid! No!
3845678 3846679 Okay.
3857624 3859793 Uh, okay, you just wait here.
3859827 3862228 I'm gonna go find out<br />where we're supposed to go.
3862261 3864664 Make sure to ask<br />where my dad is.
3864697 3866733 Excuse me,<br />sorry, sorry for...
3868467 3869601 Merry Christmas.
3869635 3870837 Merry Christmas.
3872471 3873739 Thanks.
3873773 3875407 Okay, we need to go<br />to Immigration.
3882547 3885484 Excuse me, can I<br />please speak to your manager?
3885517 3888553 My wife is gonna flay me<br />if I don't get home soon.
3888587 3890689 That's sweet.<br />Take a number and a seat.
3896896 3898463 Whoa, dude.
3902901 3905436 Oh,<br />Powers of the Hereafter,
3905469 3909540 accept my Charles as<br />I have accepted his passing.
3910307 3911777 No, I haven't.
3911810 3913812 And I won't ever.
3913845 3915847 There is no expiry date<br />on sorrow.
3917248 3919517 Oh. Oh, that's good.
3919550 3923320 Though there is no expiry date<br />on sorrow!
3923354 3924890 Kings of Commerce,
3924923 3926457 Knights of Nasdaq,
3926490 3930727 deem him worthy to enter<br />the gates of your realm.
3930760 3933363 You are no more, my king.
3933396 3935532 But with the blessing<br />of the angels
3935565 3937267 of undying love...
3938002 3940871 I, your surviving queen,
3940905 3943273 proudly take up the mantle<br />of your...
3948611 3950613 Okay.<br />There you go. Thank you.
3952049 3953884 You all right, honey?<br />You look a little manic.
3953918 3955452 Just pre-wedding jitters.
3955485 3957353 I'm just gonna go up<br />and try on my dress,
3957387 3958889 but don't come up
3958923 3960557 'cause it's bad luck to see me<br />before the ceremony.
3960590 3961591 Sure.
3963759 3966395 Oh, well, hello.<br />Who's clowning around?
3966428 3968363 - Trick or treat!<br />- Trick or treat!
3968397 3969698 Here we are.
3969732 3971266 - Apples...<br />- Thank you!
3971300 3973268 ...carrot sticks,<br />and some blonde raisins,
3973302 3974737 'cause no one likes<br />a big, fat clown.
3978574 3980242 I can't believe I'm doing this.
3981610 3983780 Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,<br />Beetlejuice.
4013474 4015476 The Juice is loose.
4017780 4019014 I need you to tell me<br />what this means.
4019047 4021950 Oh, well, let's have a look,<br />shall we?
4021984 4024484 Long story short,<br />your daughter's screwed.
4024518 4026553 She decided to trade lives<br />with the boy.
4026586 4027989 He gets to come back,
4028022 4029689 while she's stuck<br />on the other side permanently.
4029723 4031591 One-way ticket<br />on the Soul Train.
4031625 4032860 -Soul Train?<br />-That's right.
4032894 4035462 Last stop, the Great Beyond.
4035495 4036998 No, she can't<br />get on that train.
4037031 4038800 You've gotta get me in there<br />so I can get her out.
4038833 4040400 Well, I can get you in,
4040433 4042569 but it's gonna<br />take a quid pro quo.
4042602 4044738 Of course there is.<br />What do you want?
4044772 4046606 Well, I've got this ex-wife,<br />you know?
4046640 4048843 And she's kind of a whack job,<br />first of all. We're through.
4048876 4050577 She's kinda clingy.
4050610 4051678 If I could just get away<br />from her permanently somehow.
4051711 4053080 You want me to marry you!
4053114 4054748 I thought you'd never ask.
4054782 4056582 How do I know that<br />you're gonna keep your word?
4056615 4058450 I swear<br />on my dead mother's soul.
4058484 4059718 Yikes!
4061822 4063422 Okay, fine.
4063455 4065457 I'll marry you if you help me<br />save my daughter.
4065491 4066692 I'm gonna need that in writing.
4066725 4068394 -Give me that.<br />-Ow.
4068427 4069428 And here we go.
4072464 4073834 I'm gonna make you so happy.
4073867 4076569 Jesus! What's the plan<br />on getting in?
4082876 4083977 Yeah.
4086079 4088613 Well, can't exactly<br />go through the front door.

4148206 4149840 - Trick or treat.<br />- Trick or treat.

4662736 4664171 Still looking.
4664204 4666073 But we did find something<br />that might help.
4678619 4680187 Hmm.
4688528 4690229 -"Bob"?<br />-Mmm?

4718523 4720192 - Rory?<br />- Father...
4720225 4722294 I'm seeing these shrunken<br />head people everywhere.
4722327 4723995 Well, be not afraid,
4724029 4726097 for thine eyes<br />will see strange things.
4726131 4727999 Are you filled<br />with fear and trembling?
4728033 4730469 Yes! I'm shitting my pants.
4730502 4732537 -Ah.<br />-What are you doing here?
4732571 4733705 I'm searching<br />for the lost lambs
4733738 4735307 to bring back into the light.
4735340 4737609 Why don't I give you a ride<br />to the church?
4744081 4746116 Trick or treat!
4747518 4749253 Sorry, sorry I just... I'll...

4750654 4752423 Excuse me. Just...
4752456 4755593 Um, sorry, I'm just, uh,<br />late for a wedding.
4755626 4758229 Hi, yes, one question,<br />how do I get out of here?
4758262 4759663 Because someone<br />made a terrible mistake.
4759697 4762199 I'm on a break.<br />Take a number. Take a seat.
4762233 4763601 No, you see, those asps,
4763634 4765102 they were defanged.<br />I paid extra for that.
4765135 4767204 Honey, you're dead, okay?
4767238 4769173 Now take a number and sit down.
4772576 4777113 Is there perhaps anyone here<br />who has the power to help me?
4777146 4778548 Did that line<br />used to work for you?
4778581 4780517 I'm not dead!
4782285 4783486 You know what?
4783520 4785255 My husband's here.<br />Charles Deetz.
4785288 4786790 Yes, he can fix this.
4786824 4788191 You call him, he can fix this,<br />he can fix anything.
4788224 4789692 Not anymore he can't.
4789726 4792328 No, wait! Wait, I know people!
4792362 4795698 Oh! I know people!<br />I am people! Why's...
4797500 4799135 No.

4809244 4811113 I get it. Now that you're dead,
4811146 4812681 you wanna hang out with me.
4812714 4814449 Would you help me<br />find Charles, please?
4814483 4816418 And then the VIP lounge.
4816451 4817854 -Sure.<br />-Okay.
4817887 4820556 Just after you help me<br />find my runaway bride.

4967031 4968732 Oh, my God! My wedding!
4968766 4970400 We're about to start.
4970434 4971969 Wait, Mom, with everything<br />that's happened tonight,
4972003 4973470 you know you don't<br />have to do this, right?
4973503 4975272 I know,<br />but if I don't do it now,
4975305 4977374 I'm never gonna do it.
4977407 4979376 But are you sure about this?
4979409 4982847 Rory loves me,<br />and that's gotta be enough.
4982880 4984749 Quickly, my dear!<br />Come! Come!
4984782 4985883 Oh.
4988853 4989987 And the lost lamb<br />is welcome into thy house
4990021 4991856 -with open arms.<br />-Oh, my God!
4993824 4995257 I thought you got cold feet.
4995291 4996592 Oh, no, blame me.
4996625 4998360 She just saved me<br />from my date from hell.
4998394 4999628 Who are all these people?
4999662 5001664 This is just<br />a couple influencers.
5001697 5003399 Nobody under<br />five million followers,
5003432 5005736 and I think we have<br />a Netflix executive in there.
5005769 5006903 We doing this?
5006937 5008805 Yeah. Where's your dress?
5008839 5010406 All that matters<br />is that I'm here, now.
5010439 5011942 So let's just skip<br />straight to the vows.
5011975 5013375 Wait, where's Delia?
5013409 5014510 Yo!
5014543 5016947 Right here.
5016980 5018581 She was helpin' me calm down<br />before the wedding.
5018614 5020016 I was feeling a little jittery.
5020050 5022318 -All, right, beat it.<br />-You.
5023486 5024787 You're that thing...
5024820 5026454 from my dream.
5026488 5028389 Well, I'm really<br />more nightmare material,
5028423 5029825 but, thanks.
5029859 5031593 - You're...<br />- Uh-uh.
5032427 5033728 Part of the deal
5033763 5035363 is you can never,<br />ever say my name, ever!
5035396 5036731 What deal?
5036766 5038000 The deal she made to save you.
5038033 5039467 By the way,<br />you can call me "Dad."
5039501 5040836 Lydia.
5040870 5042905 You agreed to marry him?
5042938 5046341 I was desperate,<br />and it was my only option.
5046374 5047675 Lydia. What's going on here?
5049011 5050913 Wow.
5050946 5052848 Awkward.
5052882 5054884 You haven't made much progress<br />since our last session,
5054917 5057618 so I'm gonna suggest<br />some drug therapy.
5057651 5059988 Don't be afraid to share.<br />When you're ready.
5066393 5068562 I always thought<br />your whole act was bullshit.
5068595 5070932 I never believed in ghosts,<br />spirits, or any of it.
5070965 5073101 What? All this time?
5073134 5075435 Why the hell<br />did you wanna get married?
5075469 5076738 Money!
5076771 5077972 I knew I could make more<br />as your husband
5078006 5079573 than I could as your manager.
5079606 5082709 And I never<br />had a dead fiancee.
5082744 5084478 I just went<br />to that survivor's retreat,
5084511 5087346 so that I could meet<br />weak women and exploit them!
5087380 5090516 And I hit the codependent<br />lottery when I met you.
5090550 5092318 How 'bout a little<br />physical therapy?
5100526 5101862 We'd like to thank you all
5101895 5103797 for coming to this<br />very special occasion,
5103831 5106432 but right now<br />we'd like a little privacy.

5406990 5408825 Mr. Juice,
5408859 5410961 you've violated code 6-9-9!
5410994 5412295 Freeze!
5413964 5415065 Book 'em, Danno!
5417167 5418768 Beetlejuice!
5422139 5424274 What the...
5424307 5425742 I'm back.
5430712 5432114 Sweetheart!
5432148 5433415 You look fantastic!
5433449 5435284 You look so...
5435317 5437853 - put together.<br />- He's mine.
5437887 5440089 It's me, not you.<br />You know, honey,
5440122 5442791 I've been goin' through<br />a lotta changes lately.
5442825 5444692 Kind of a mid-afterlife<br />crisis, I guess.
5444727 5447897 Your soul belongs to me,<br />my love.
5447930 5449765 For eternity.
5449798 5451066 You don't wanna<br />spend your eternity with me.
5451100 5452234 I'm a lone wolf.
5452268 5453869 You need a soulmate.
5453903 5456704 Somebody who really sees you.<br />For instance.
5462877 5465146 I need something<br />to draw with. Quick!
5499146 5500280 <i>Olé.</i>
5512326 5513860 - Let's go!<br />- Hey!
5514795 5516430 We had a deal.
5516463 5518131 She doesn't have to marry you.
5518165 5520133 - What?<br />-  -You violated code 6-9-9.
5520167 5522836 Yeah, you illegally brought<br />my mom into the Afterlife.
5522869 5525137 According to that book,<br />that contract is null and void.
5528874 5531310 Look, I'm sorry things didn't<br />work out between us,
5531344 5533546 but the 600-year age gap
5533579 5535348 was a little bit much for me.
5535381 5536882 -Beetle...<br />-Ah!
5536916 5538284 Beetlejuice.
5542989 5544056 Beetlejuice.
5551464 5553165 - Hey!<br />- Beetlejuice.
5563475 5565176 Shoulda got married in Vegas.
5573518 5575120 Looks like<br />we're a little late, boys.
5577188 5579324 Tape off the crime scene,<br />call in forensics,
5579357 5582160 and keep<br />the goddamn media away.
5582193 5585363 Little lady, you just<br />popped his Beetlejuice.
5585397 5586897 Say your goodbyes,
5586930 5588866 you can take a selfie now,<br />if you like,
5588899 5590100 but make it quick.
5591935 5593570 Sister, you're comin' with me.
5593604 5595506 What? Delia, what did you do?
5595539 5597107 I fell for a scam,
5597141 5600010 and I'm counting on you<br />to claim a refund.
5600044 5601578 Those snakes were actually<br />poisonous, weren't they?
5601612 5605049 Yeah. So, I died<br />of embarrassment.
5605082 5607217 Your work's gonna<br />go up in value.
5607251 5608919 - Oh! Oh, well, then.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
5609486 5611121 Delia...
5611155 5612856 -I'll miss you.<br />-No, you won't.
5612890 5614892 I'll find Charles<br />and we'll haunt you both,
5614925 5616927 until you beg us to move on!
5616960 5618995 Nice work<br />for a couple of Fleshbags.
5619028 5620930 Don't come knockin'<br />until it's your time,
5620963 5622632 and in the meantime, remember,
5622665 5624500 you gotta keep it real.
5624534 5626002 Come on, beautiful,
5626035 5628004 we got a date<br />with the commissioner.
5673682 5674950 Charles!
5676551 5677886 Delia!
5680187 5681455 I can't believe you're here!
5684425 5685693 Oh, Charles.
5685727 5687495 I'm so happy<br />to see you!
5688396 5689697 Oh, Charles,
5689731 5691132 look what happened to me!
5693667 5696003 This is the 10:13,
5696036 5697905 to the Great Beyond!
5698472 5699940 All aboard
5699974 5701475 the Soul Train!
5712218 5714487 I wanna thank<br />all you Ghosties out there,
5714521 5717357 for all your support<br />over the years,
5717390 5720527 but this is my last show.
5720560 5724230 I have spent so much time<br />talking to the dead,
5724264 5726332 it's time I started living.
