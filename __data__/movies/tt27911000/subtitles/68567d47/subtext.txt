88542 90250 What's wrong?
90375 92500 There's someone on the roof.
93375 95500 Jules!<br />Baby, are you sleepwalking?
95542 96918 Listen.
102876 104125 I don't hear anything.
104250 106125 Come on, baby,<br />it's 3:00 in the morning.
106167 107626 MARK:<br />What now?
107751 109751 I don't know, she said she heard something on the roof.
109876 111626 There were footsteps.
111667 113375 MARK:<br />Naturally.
113500 114876 Jingle bells too, right?
115000 116125 Mark, stop.
116250 117250 But I heard him.
117375 118792 MARK:<br />Can you take care of this,<br />please?
118876 121292 I gotta be up in three hours.
121375 124167 Come on, Jules,<br />let's get back into bed.
126375 128626 No more sugar after dinner,<br />okay?
128667 131250 Too many bad dreams<br />and not enough sleep.
131375 132167 But mom!
132250 133876 I didn't have a bad dream.
133918 135542 I really heard someone<br />on the roof!
135626 136167 Shh.
136250 137125 Keep your voice down.
137167 139042 Don't wake up your brother.
139125 141125 Nobody believes me.
141542 144751 Jules, it's probably just<br />the house settling.
144792 146042 Or an animal.
146125 147626 You know, sometimes a raccoon<br />or squirrel can get up there.
147667 148542 It was Santa.
148626 150292 I'm positive.
150375 151876 (CHUCKLES)
153667 156000 You know who I really think<br />it was?
156042 157500 Who?
157542 159167 JENNIFER:<br />One of Santa's elves.
159250 160125 An elf?
160250 161626 JENNIFER:<br />Mhm.
161667 164250 Sometimes Santa sends a scout<br />a few days before Christmas Eve
164292 166000 to make sure our house meets<br />all the necessary
166125 167542 safety requirements.
167626 168751 Like what?
168792 170626 Like making sure the roof<br />is sturdy enough
170667 172751 to hold all the reindeer,<br />for one thing.
172792 174042 Can't have them crashing<br />through the ceiling,
174125 176000 running all through the house,<br />pooping on everything.
176042 177500 (BOTH GIGGLE)
177542 178751 What else?
178876 180667 They have to measure the chimney<br />to make sure it's wide enough
180751 183292 to fit Santa's big fat belly.
183375 186167 Sometimes he splurges<br />too much during the holidays.
186250 187876 Just like daddy?
187918 189417 Just like daddy.
189500 192667 Can we leave some milk<br />and cookies out for the elves?
192751 194375 If you go to sleep right now,
194500 196500 I'll go downstairs<br />and leave them a plate.
196626 197626 Okay?
243626 245250 (EXHALES)
246500 248500 You forgot to lock<br />the front door again.
249751 250751 Perhaps you could have<br />a little concern
250792 252626 for your family's safety?
255751 257500 By the way, your daughter left<br />a glass of milk and cookies
257626 259417 for Santa's elves<br />in the kitchen.
260292 262626 Can you make sure to eat them before she gets up for school?
264500 266000 Hello?
266417 268375 Can you take care of that<br />when you wake up, please?
268500 270000 MARK:<br />When I wake up?
270125 272500 I am up, Jen.
272626 275250 I have been up<br />because you keep talking to me.
279042 281125 I will take care of it.
282626 283876 Thank you, Mr. Grinch.
284000 284751 (KISSES)
305751 307375 Santa?
334250 335918 Timmy!
336000 336667 Timmy, wake up!
336751 338500 Santa's downstairs.
339292 340375 Timmy!
340500 342292 He was putting presents<br />under the tree, I saw him!
342375 344542 Go away!

1583167 1584417 I've missed you more than ever.
1584500 1587000 And getting into trouble<br />hasn't been nearly as much fun
1587042 1588751 without you.
1588792 1591042 Looking forward<br />to the best Christmas ever,
1591125 1594250 filled with fun,<br />smiles, and laughter.

1666125 1667751 Please don't tell me<br />you believe all the stories
1667792 1669000 about this place.
1669125 1671500 What stories?
1671626 1673876 Back in the early 90s,
1674000 1678375 some maniac abducted<br />and killed over a dozen kids
1678417 1680125 in this town.
1680167 1681792 They buried all the bodies<br />in the basement here
1681876 1683375 in this building.
1684042 1686918 Now everyone swears<br />the place is haunted.
1696751 1698500 Are you fucking with me?
1701125 1702876 You're fucking with me.

1760918 1763250 What's the matter<br />with Blaster Man?
1763292 1764626 I thought you liked him.
1764751 1766375 You only draw boys.
1766500 1768500 Boys, boys, boys.
1768542 1769918 That's not true.
1770000 1771876 I draw girls all the ti--<br />that is a girl right there.
1771918 1773500 Look at that.
1773542 1774751 That is a girl.
1774792 1777626 But she's not a superhero.
1777751 1779751 Last time you said<br />you were going to draw a girl
1779792 1781876 that could beat up Blaster Man.
1782000 1783167 Remember?
1784500 1786542 You pinky swore!
1786626 1788000 That's sacred.
1789250 1790876 I'm sorry, sweetheart.
1791417 1793000 I will tell you what, though.
1793125 1794751 As soon as I'm finished<br />with this comic,
1794792 1796292 I'm gonna make you<br />something really special.
1796375 1798000 How's that? Okay?
1798042 1799667 Yeah, yeah.
1799751 1801250 Yeah, yeah.
1802250 1803626 Yeah, well.
1803667 1805250 Okay.
1805375 1806626 Time for bed.
1810500 1812000 Sisi!
1812751 1814167 Wait a minute.
1816375 1818375 I do have something for you.
1826626 1828542 I woke up back<br />in the clown cafÃ©,
1828626 1830417 encased in glass.
1830500 1832876 My lungs filled with ice water.
1832918 1834918 This wasn't a dream<br />or a hallucination.
1835000 1836125 (GASPS)
1836167 1837626 Okay, give me that.
1837751 1838792 (EXHALES)
1838876 1841626 This isn't<br />for public consumption, nosy.
1841751 1843000 It's my diary. Okay?
1843125 1844667 It's for my eyes only.
1844751 1845918 Got it?
1846000 1847167 Got it.
1848542 1850500 What's the clown cafÃ©?
1851125 1852751 It's a bad place.
1852792 1855667 A place I don't want<br />to think about.
1855751 1858125 Happy thoughts<br />from now on. Okay?
1858250 1859417 Okay.
1880626 1886626 Jingle bells, jingle bells,<br />this place fucking smells
1906167 1909751 Disgusting.

2176876 2177751 We're gonna go all out, man.
2177876 2179167 Chocolate and peanut butter,<br />you are right.
2179250 2180375 That's the combination.
2180500 2183042 You know, those coconut peanut<br />butter ones are amazing.
2183125 2185500 JESSICA:<br />This is going to be<br />a Christmas extravaganza.
2185626 2187417 GREG:<br />I'd like to go see<br />those lights again.
2187500 2188626 JESSICA:<br />I wanna see the lights.
2188751 2191375 I like the holiday market that<br />they have over there.
2191417 2192876 Gabs, stop starin'.
2193626 2194542 It's rude.
2194626 2195125 GABBIE:<br />What?
2195250 2196417 I like her scars.
2196500 2197876 JESSICA:<br />Gabbie!
2197918 2199375 No, it's fine.
2199417 2200500 No, it's not.
2200542 2201792 It's very inappropriate.
2201876 2203626 I just think they're cool.
2203751 2204626 GREG:<br />You know what?
2204751 2206918 Why don't you show her<br />your new scar?
2207000 2208292 Look at this thing.
2208375 2209000 Bad boy.
2209042 2209626 Ooh.
2209667 2210626 How'd you get that?
2210667 2212125 Fell off my bike<br />during summer break.
2212250 2214500 And landed on a broken bottle.
2214542 2215417 GREG:<br />Oh, yeah.
2215500 2216751 Seven stitches, too.
2216876 2218626 There was so much blood,<br />and like this piece
2218751 2219667 of fat oozing out.
2219751 2220626 JESSICA:<br />All right, all right.
2220667 2222000 Can we change the subject,<br />please?
2222042 2224417 I don't wanna think about blood<br />and fat while we're eating.
2224500 2225375 So much blood.
2225500 2227125 JESSICA:<br />Okay, honey.
2227250 2228667 You're disgusting.
2229626 2230751 Regardless,
2230792 2232375 Christmas hasn't really been<br />the same around here
2232417 2234792 since someone stopped<br />believing in Santa Claus.
2234876 2236250 SIENNA:<br />When did that happen?
2236292 2237542 When I was, like, eight.
2237626 2238250 Oh, stop.
2238292 2239250 You were older than that.
2239375 2240626 No,<br />I just went along with it
2240751 2242125 so you and Daddy<br />wouldn't feel bad.
2243000 2244500 I've been finding presents<br />stashed around the house
2244542 2245500 for years now.
2245626 2247125 Yeah, that's 'cause<br />you're a little snoop.
2247167 2247751 Yeah.
2247876 2249000 Finding is a loose term.
2249125 2251250 More like investigating<br />and discovering, really.
2251375 2252417 BROOKE:<br />Can you pass the rice?
2252500 2254500 It's not my fault that<br />they're really, really bad
2254626 2255375 at hiding presents.
2255500 2257000 Dude, it was under<br />the floorboard,
2257042 2257876 under the carpet.
2257918 2258667 (CHUCKLES)
2258751 2259751 BROOKE:<br />Pass the rice, please?
2259792 2261500 Oh, she's also notorious<br />for opening presents
2261626 2262542 and then re-wrapping them.
2262626 2263876 Not very well, either.

2275000 2276292 Hello, Sienna?
2277125 2279500 You know, I'm dead because<br />of you, okay?
2279626 2280626 You led us to him.
2280667 2282626 You and that little shithead<br />brother of yours.
2283876 2287918 I'm dead and you killed me.
2288876 2290125 Just like you killed<br />your mother.

2291500 2292250 BROOKE:<br />That was bad.
2292292 2293167 I didn't...
2293250 2294375 BROOKE:<br />But anyway.
2294500 2296125 I mean,<br />that's how he always did it.

2381167 2382125 (CHUCKLES)
2382250 2383876 She's obsessed<br />with the Miles County Clown.

2417125 2418250 that I wanted to ask you.
2418375 2420542 You see, my roommate and I,<br />we have a true crime podcast.
2420626 2421792 It's called Graven Image.
2421876 2423250 And our Miles County Massacre<br />episodes?
2423375 2425250 They get our biggest hits<br />by far.
2425292 2427250 So I was wondering<br />if maybe you'd be willing
2427292 2428626 to come on as a guest sometime?
2428751 2430250 I seriously would be so honored.
2430375 2433250 I don't really do<br />things like that.
2433375 2436125 Jesus, do you really think<br />he wants to dredge up
2436250 2438000 the worst experience<br />of his life?
2438125 2439375 I mean, the kid's just trying<br />to move on.
2439500 2440500 Right, Shaw?
2440542 2442751 MIA:<br />Okay, well, I get that,<br />but I just--
2442876 2446000 I think a lot of people would<br />really like to hear from you

3407751 3410042 As good as can be expected.
3410125 3413000 I think Gabbie brought some<br />life back into her today, right?
3413042 3414375 It's nice to see her smile<br />a little bit.
3414417 3415375 (CHUCKLES)
3415500 3417250 Oh my god, Gabbie.
3417292 3420000 She follows Sienna around like<br />a brand new puppy.
3420042 3422167 GREG:<br />It's concerning.
3422250 3424667 Now they're going<br />Christmas shopping tomorrow.
3426125 3427042 Just the two of 'em?
3427125 3428125 Mhm.
3428250 3430375 Sienna wants to pick up<br />a gift for Jonathan.
3431375 3433751 You really think<br />that's a good idea?
3433792 3435250 They'll be fine.
3437000 3439167 Jess...
3439250 3441876 ...did you not see<br />what happened today?
3441918 3444167 What if that little episode<br />was just a microcosm
3444250 3445751 of what's to come?
3446125 3447918 What if that shit gets worse?
3448000 3449876 I'm not gonna abandon her.
3449918 3450500 She's healing.
3450626 3452250 It's gonna take time.
3453250 3455125 She's taking her medication.
3456918 3459417 All I'm saying is, let's keep<br />our guard up, all right?
3461375 3462918 That's all I'm saying.
3464876 3465918 Okay.

3533125 3534000 Don't go past this point.
3534042 3535042 You'll be in trouble.
3535125 3536751 MALL ELF BOB:<br />Thank you.
3536792 3537667 Next.
3537751 3539500 All right, buddy,<br />smile for the camera.
3540250 3542500 You guys ready to meet Santa?
3542542 3543751 What are you going to ask for?
3544375 3545167 Makeup?
3545250 3546042 Yeah.
3546125 3548250 Are you old enough for makeup?
3548292 3549626 Okay. Thank you.
3549667 3550751 Next.
3556876 3557918 Hey, Gabs.
3558000 3559500 You think he'll like this?
3559626 3560250 GABBIE:<br />Hmm.
3560375 3561500 Not sure.
3561542 3563876 I don't think Jonathan<br />is really into black anymore.
3564417 3566000 Jonathan doesn't wear black?
3566125 3567500 Mr. Death Metal?
3567542 3569876 I don't think he listens<br />to that anymore either.
3570167 3571626 Just a phase, I guess.
3573918 3578292 All right, well, then,<br />what does he wear now?
3578375 3579542 GABBIE:<br />I don't know.
3580792 3582250 Normal clothes?
3582918 3584125 Really narrows it down.
3584250 3585918 Thanks, Gabs.
3586000 3586500 Okay, sweetie.
3586542 3587292 You ready?
3588125 3589500 (KID GIGGLES)
3590125 3590542 Okay.
3590626 3591250 Thank you.
3591292 3592500 -Bye, Santa.<br />-Bye.
3594375 3596000 At least it's better<br />than Louisville.
3596125 3597250 You got a point, Bob.
3598167 3599626 Let's take a break.
3599667 3600751 Oh.
3600876 3602876 Sorry, folks.
3603000 3605125 Santa's gotta go feed<br />his reindeer.
3605918 3607626 You know,<br />I'm not in charge here.
3608751 3610292 Can we go on a break too?
3610375 3611542 Sure.
3613626 3615042 This one's nice.
3615125 3616792 Hmm, not bad.
3616876 3617751 Is it your favorite?
3617876 3618876 Top three.

3740876 3742042 on his sister's behalf,
3742125 3743667 she'd probably be serving<br />a life sentence right now.

3772626 3774000 So...
3774042 3775751 ...Why'd you want to see me<br />right now?
3778000 3779042 I-- I missed you.
3779125 3781876 I mean, can't a sister see<br />her little brother?
3782000 3783626 (CHUCKLES)
3786417 3789125 Um, actually,<br />I was, uh,
3789167 3791292 I was thinking,
3791375 3793000 why don't you come over<br />Aunt Jess's tonight?
3793125 3794375 I mean,<br />why wait till Christmas Eve?
3794500 3796542 You've gotta be done<br />with classes by now, right?
3796626 3799500 I can't, I can't tonight.
3799626 3801626 Why not?
3801751 3804375 There's a party on campus<br />that I was invited to.
3805125 3806542 Really?
3807375 3808375 Oh.

3823000 3825792 I've, uh, heard a lot about you.

3827500 3828626 Hi.
3828751 3832125 Well, you've got a cool<br />baby bro here, and I treat him
3832250 3833167 like he's my own.
3833250 3834751 You treat me like shit.
3834792 3835792 (CHUCKLES)
3835876 3837500 Oh, he jokes.
3838375 3838918 Oh, shit.
3839000 3839876 Let me get out of here.
3839918 3841292 Oh my God.
3841375 3842500 Sienna!
3842626 3844542 You're Sienna Shaw!
3844626 3847876 I, I seriously so--<br />I can't believe I'm sitting here
3847918 3849000 with you guys.
3849125 3850792 I was literally just telling<br />your little brother.
3850876 3851751 I'm sorry.
3851792 3852667 I'm probably being<br />a little weird.
3852751 3855918 I'm just super stoked<br />to see you.
3856000 3859167 Mia has been following<br />our story very closely.
3859250 3861626 I am a true crime enthusiast,
3861751 3864000 and I've actually been following<br />your case in particular
3864042 3867167 for years on my podcast,<br />and no rush or anything,
3867250 3869125 but I do know the five year<br />anniversary is coming up
3869167 3871375 and the fanbase is rabid.
3871417 3874876 Like, we would literally<br />kill for anything.
3875000 3877542 I'm thinking, Get Readys<br />with Me, What I Eat in a Day...
3877626 3878626 Just show us how you're coping.
3878667 3880000 You know, what you do<br />on a daily basis,
3880125 3881542 anything like that.
3881626 3882792 How I'm coping?
3883042 3884292 Yeah.
3886167 3887751 How we're coping?
3889626 3894000 Well, uh, I've been in and out<br />of a psychiatric hospital
3894042 3895250 for the past five years.
3895375 3896667 Oh.
3896751 3900500 I see images of my dead friends<br />and relatives on a daily basis,
3900626 3903792 images that wake me up screaming<br />in the middle of the night.
3903876 3906500 I have hideous scars<br />all over my body,
3906542 3908000 and every time I see them,
3908042 3911375 I think of how that sick fuck<br />who ruined our lives
3911417 3912542 is still out there.
3912626 3914417 And you want to know<br />how I'm coping with everything?
3917250 3920876 You guys are all<br />the same leeches.
3920918 3922125 Sienna.
3922167 3925751 Can't you act like a human being<br />for one fucking second?
3931542 3933751 (TAKING DEEP BREATHS)
3936000 3937626 Sienna, what's wrong with you?
3937751 3938500 I saw him today.

3942292 3943042 Where?
3943125 3945500 At the mall, with Gabbie.
3945626 3947000 JONATHAN:<br />How can you be sure<br />it was really him?
3947125 3948626 I'm not, I'm not sure<br />of anything anymore.
3948751 3951125 I don't know what's real<br />or what's in my fucking head.
3951167 3953417 Well,<br />what'd you see exactly?
3955125 3957167 He was dressed as Santa Claus.
3958751 3959626 Santa Claus?
3959751 3961292 Okay, I know, I know<br />how that sounds...
3961375 3962751 (TAKES A DEEP BREATH)
3962876 3963626 SIENNA:<br />...but it was him.
3963751 3965792 I could--<br />I could feel it.
3965876 3967500 (EXHALES)
3967626 3969125 We both know this isn't over.
3970000 3971125 You don't know that.
3971250 3973250 I mean, Jesus Christ,<br />you cut his fucking head off.
3974125 3975292 SIENNA:<br />Come here.
3978751 3980042 Hey, what is this?
3980125 3980876 Jonathan!
3980918 3983000 Hey, why are you<br />shutting me out?
3983125 3984167 I'm not shutting you out.
3984250 3986000 You don't believe me?
3986125 3987292 Why would he come back here?
3987375 3988500 (SIENNA SCOFFS)
3988626 3990375 JONATHAN:<br />Even if he was alive,<br />which he isn't.
3990500 3992250 Wouldn't you want to get as far<br />away from here as possible,
3992375 3993375 as far away from you?
3993417 3995000 Maybe it's me they want.<br />Isn't that what you said?
3995042 3996167 Boy genius.
3996250 3997250 What are you,<br />Mr. Academic now?
3997292 3999375 You think you're too good<br />for your own--
4001542 4003000 I'm sorry.
4003125 4005000 At least I'm fucking trying.
4009000 4010167 I'm proud of you.
4012250 4014375 We need each other, okay?
4015667 4017167 I need you.
4017792 4021000 What we need to do<br />is move on.
4021042 4022375 Let it go.
4023125 4024375 It's over.

4034375 4036042 I still have your letters.
4036876 4039250 You wrote me almost every week<br />when I first went away.
4039292 4040542 Remember that?
4040626 4043500 All your theories<br />about demonology, possession.
4043542 4044125 You became obsessed.
4044250 4045500 But you weren't crazy.
4045626 4046626 You were right!
4046751 4047626 I'm not listening to this.
4047751 4049292 You listen to me!
4051375 4055250 'Sometimes demons<br />try to enter our world,
4055375 4057125 only they can't do it alone.
4057250 4059751 They have to choose a vessel,<br />someone recently deceased
4059876 4062000 who functions as a bridge<br />between worlds.
4062125 4064000 But not just anyone.
4064125 4066125 Someone sinister, depraved.
4066250 4068292 The worst kind of evil.

4096626 4098792 It's you, Sienna.

4104125 4106000 Whoever chose me<br />was guiding him.
4106042 4108626 He was preparing me for this.
4111876 4114667 It's using Victoria Heyes<br />as a host now, isn't it?
4116375 4118125 That's why she disappeared<br />that night.
4129792 4131500 What do you wanna do?
4131626 4133751 What, do we just up<br />and leave town?
4133792 4137667 Call the cops, tell Aunt Jess<br />and Uncle Greg?
4137751 4138876 No. They'll never believe us.
4139000 4140500 Especially me.
4146751 4149375 I have to go back<br />to the Terrifier.
4150918 4152292 Why?
4155167 4156918 It's still buried there,<br />isn't it?
4157751 4160375 And if I'm right,<br />it might be the only thing
4160500 4161876 that can stop them.
