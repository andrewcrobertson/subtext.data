213130 214715 [slave grunting]
235377 236461 Whoa.
243991 244995 Whoa.
259801 262554 Who's that stumbling around in the dark?
263488 266600 State your business,<br />or prepare to get winged.
267684 271229 Calm yourselves, gentlemen.<br />I mean you no harm.
272564 275275 I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
275358 276443 Whoa!
278737 280489 Good, cold evening, gentlemen.
280572 284785 I'm looking for a pair of slave traders<br />that go by the name of the Speck Brothers.
284910 285994 Might that be you?
287996 290248 -[Ace] Who wants to know?<br />-Well, I do.
290832 293126 I'm Dr. King Schultz.<br />This is my horse, Fritz.
294544 297506 -What kind of doctor?<br />-[Schultz] Dentist.
298173 299466 Now, are you the Speck Brothers,
299591 302469 and did you purchase those men<br />at the Greenville slave auction?
302594 305347 -So what?<br />-So, I wish to parley with you.
305428 306328 Speak English.
306515 308225 [chuckling] I'm sorry.
308934 311061 Please forgive me.<br />It is a second language.
311144 314648 Now, amongst your inventory,<br />I've been led to believe,
314731 316900 is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.
317275 318777 Hello, you poor devils.
320111 325408 Is there one amongst you who was formerly<br />a resident of the Carrucan plantation?
326952 328578 [Django] I'm from the Carrucan plantation.
330872 331960 Who said that?
379296 380297 What's your name?
384968 385975 Django.
387178 389222 Then you are exactly<br />the one I'm looking for.
391474 393226 Do you know who the Brittle brothers are?
397376 398398 Who are they?
400901 401981 Big John.
403111 404165 Ellis.
405697 406781 Roger.
407198 409284 Sometime they call him Little Raj.
411202 413246 They was overseers<br />at the Carrucan plantation.
413622 414623 Not anymore.
418001 422297 Tell me, if you were to see any<br />of these three gentlemen again,
422380 424090 -would you recognize them?<br />-[Ace] Hey.
425342 427761 -Stop talking to him like that.<br />-Like what?
428178 429212 Like that.
429471 431973 My good man,<br />I'm simply trying to ascertain--
432057 433475 Speak English, goddamn it.
434225 440315 Everybody calm down. I'm simply a customer<br />trying to conduct a transaction.
440398 442984 I don't care. No sale. Now, off with you.
443193 446154 Don't be ridiculous.<br />Of course they're for sale.
447197 448208 [Ace] Move it.
448907 453745 My good man, did you simply get<br />carried away with your dramatic gesture,
453828 456998 or are you pointing your weapon at me<br />with lethal intention?
457207 458260 [cocks gun]
459000 460377 Last chance, fancy pants.
461920 463546 Oh, very well.
467550 469803 [Dicky screaming]
480939 481982 [Dicky groaning]
488405 491992 [Dicky screaming]
493201 497747 I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,<br />but I didn't want you to do anything rash
497831 500041 before you had a moment<br />to come to your senses.
500291 503420 You goddamn son of a bitch!
503962 505964 -You shot Roscoe!<br />-[Schultz] Well...
506840 508133 [Dicky] And you killed Ace!
508508 511386 I only shot your brother<br />once he threatened to shoot me.
511553 514472 And I do believe I have...<br />One, two, three, four...
514556 517517 Five witnesses who can<br />attest to that fact.
517726 520478 -Damn leg's busted.<br />-No doubt.
520562 523398 Now, if you could keep your caterwauling<br />down to a minimum,
523481 526401 I'd like to finish my line of inquiry<br />with young Django.
526818 530030 [Dicky screaming]
530822 533450 -[Dicky] God-fucking-damn it!<br />-As I was saying...
534409 536578 if you were to see<br />the Brittle brothers again,
536828 538079 you could recognize them?
538705 539721 Yeah.
540623 543043 Sold American! So, Mr. Speck?
543334 545545 Mr. Speck, how much<br />for young Django, here?
551384 553470 That iron is nasty business.
559392 560852 Could you hold this for a moment?
563075 564147 Thank you.
564481 566441 Django, get up on that horse.
567358 568818 Also, if I were you,
569110 572781 I'd take that winter coat<br />the dear, departed Speck left behind.
587253 590423 Nigger! Don't you touch my brother's coat.
599933 602393 [screams]
602477 604062 [Dicky] Goddamn it!
604896 606564 [Dicky groans]
608858 613279 One hundred, ten, twenty,
614030 615365 and five...
617117 620411 for young Django, here. And since<br />he won't be needing it anymore,
620495 622789 I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.
623623 625792 Also, Mr. Speck,
626042 629379 I'm afraid I will require a bill of sale.<br />Do you have one?
630969 632841 You go to hell, dentist!
633842 635009 I thought not.
635802 638763 No worries. I come prepared.
643601 644725 Thank you.
645395 648690 This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
661233 662287 Whoa.
666499 669065 Now, as to you poor devils...
670503 671754 So, as I see it,
672338 675008 when it comes to the subject<br />of what to do next,
675383 677886 you gentlemen have two choices.
678469 680597 One. Once I'm gone,
681097 683641 you could lift that beast<br />off the remaining Speck,
683725 685351 then carry him to the nearest town.
685810 688813 Which would be at least 37 miles<br />back the way you came.
689522 690669 Or, two.
691691 693234 You could unshackle yourselves...
693985 695069 take that rifle,
695445 698114 put a bullet in his head,<br />bury the two of them deep,
698323 701367 and then make your way to a more<br />enlightened area of this country.
702577 703578 Choice is yours.
703953 705663 Oh, and on the off chance
705747 708416 there are any astronomy aficionados<br />amongst you,
708499 710919 the North Star is that one.
712749 713755 Ta-ta!
715050 716132 [clicks tongue]
729062 730605 [chains clanking]
730980 734234 Now, wait a minute, fellas.<br />Let's talk about this.
738655 741741 You gotta be reasonable<br />in a situation like this.
743409 746412 I'm not a bad guy. I'm just doing my job.
746788 749958 Blueberry, didn't I give you<br />my last apple?
750625 751751 Tell you what, boys.
751834 754879 Take me to the doc in El Paso, I'll get<br />you your freedom.
755338 757423 -[gun cocks]<br />-[Dicky] No. No, please.
804743 805763 All right, now.
806556 808558 I'd like you to take<br />two of these, tonight.
808641 810476 -[coughs]<br />-And then, in the morning...
813104 814355 There's a nigger on the horse!
840340 841716 What's everybody staring at?
842508 844469 They ain't never seen no nigger<br />on no horse, before.
846721 849515 [goats bleating]
856962 858024 Whoa.
868076 869786 Good morning, innkeeper.
871704 873915 Two beers for two weary travelers.
874123 878044 It's still a bit early.<br />We won't be open for another hour.
878795 880380 By then, we'll be serving breakfast.
881714 883091 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
884008 885802 What the hell you think you're doing, boy?
886219 887720 Get that nigger out of here.
893309 894977 [innkeeper] Help! Help!
895061 895978 [Schultz] Innkeeper!
896396 899315 Remember, get the sheriff,<br />not the marshal.
899941 901359 [innkeeper] <i>Sheriff! Help!</i>
901734 902735 Alas.
904612 906697 Now, we must act as our own bartender.
909492 910785 Sit down, my boy.
921087 923047 -What kind of dentist are you?<br />-[chuckles]
924924 929053 Despite that cart, I haven't<br />practiced dentistry in five years.
933975 936310 But these days,<br />I practice a new profession.
939439 940487 Bounty hunter.
947321 948739 Do you know what a bounty hunter is?
949529 950533 No.
950950 951951 Well...
953786 957582 The way the slave trade<br />deals in human lives for cash,
958040 960001 a bounty hunter deals in corpses.
960877 962378 [clicking tongue] Hat.
966674 967675 <i>Prost.</i>
976434 978978 The state places a bounty on a man's head.
979103 982106 I track that man, I find that man,<br />I kill that man.
982190 986068 After I've killed him, I transport<br />that man's corpse back to the authorities.
986360 988613 Sometimes that's easier said than done.
988946 991949 I show that corpse to the authorities,<br />proving yes, indeed,
992033 996204 I truly have killed him, at which point,<br />the authorities pay me the bounty.
996871 1000291 So, like slavery,<br />it's a flesh-for-cash business.
1001840 1002919 What's a bounty?
1006881 1008132 It's like a reward.
1008883 1011302 You kill people<br />and they give you a reward?
1012303 1013638 Certain people, yeah.
1014222 1015848 -Bad people?<br />-Ah!
1016432 1018309 Badder they are, bigger the reward.
1019477 1020770 Which brings me to you.
1021854 1025107 And I must admit, I'm at a bit<br />of a quandary when it comes to you.
1026526 1028694 On one hand, I despise slavery.
1028986 1032114 On the other hand, I need your help.
1032198 1034742 If you're not in a position<br />to refuse, all the better.
1036410 1040498 So for the time being, I'm gonna make<br />this slavery malarkey work to my benefit.
1041457 1043709 Still, having said that...
1045002 1046066 I feel guilty.
1048047 1052969 So, I would like the two of us<br />to enter into an agreement.
1060309 1061936 I'm looking for the Brittle brothers.
1066816 1070027 However, at this endeavor,<br />I'm at a slight disadvantage,
1070861 1072738 insofar as I don't know<br />what they look like.
1074740 1077243 But you do. Don't you?
1077994 1079495 I know what they look like, all right.
1080162 1081202 Good.
1081706 1082957 So, here's my agreement.
1083916 1085876 You travel with me until we find them.
1085960 1087211 -Where we going?<br />-Ah,
1087295 1090089 I hear at least two of them<br />are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,
1090172 1091299 but I don't know where.
1092466 1096929 That means we visit every plantation<br />in Gatlinburg till we find them.
1097054 1098180 And when we find them...
1099390 1101726 you point them out, and I kill them.
1103436 1104500 You do that?
1105187 1109275 I agree to give you your freedom.<br />25 dollars per Brittle brother,
1109358 1111152 -that's 75 dollars.<br />-[chatter outside]
1111235 1114739 And, as if on cue, here comes the sheriff.
1122496 1125416 Okay, boys. Fun's over.
1126890 1127918 Come on out.
1130504 1131547 [indistinct chatter]]
1131631 1134884 All right, folks. Calm down.
1136260 1137595 Go about your business.
1139096 1140806 These jokers'll be gone, soon.
1143267 1147688 Now, why y'all wanna come<br />into my town and start trouble?
1149565 1151859 Scare all these nice people!
1153152 1155446 You ain't got nothing better to do
1156155 1161911 than to come into Bill Sharp's town<br />and show your ass?
1162620 1164372 -[gunshot]<br />-[sheriff screams]
1164497 1166540 [Sheriff groans]
1166624 1167875 [woman screams]
1170169 1171962 [man] What'd you just do to our sheriff?
1176634 1178177 -[gunshot]<br />-[woman gasps]
1178386 1180763 [crowd screaming]
1185393 1186936 Now, you can get the marshal.
1189146 1191524 [innkeeper] Marshal! Marshal!
1191607 1193734 -[Schultz] Should we wait inside?<br />-Can't we just leave?
1193859 1194898 After you.
1197571 1200991 Move that buckboard a long ways<br />across the street from the saloon.
1201992 1204161 I want six men, six rifles behind it.
1204954 1207331 I want two men, two rifles<br />up on this roof,
1207415 1209041 two men, two rifles on that roof.
1209750 1211877 All the barrels aimed at that front door.
1213170 1215840 Somebody get poor Bill out of the goddamn<br />street.
1216924 1218134 You, in the saloon!
1219635 1222346 We got 100 rifles aimed<br />at every way out of that building.
1223597 1226058 You got one chance<br />to get out of this alive.
1227560 1230438 You and your nigger come out, right now,<br />with your hands over your head
1230521 1231605 and I mean right now!
1233107 1236736 [Schultz] <i>Is this the marshal</i><br /><i>I have the pleasure of addressing?</i>
1237234 1238279 Yes, it is.
1239029 1240823 This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.
1241282 1242950 [Schultz] Na, wunderbar, <i>marshal.</i>
1243993 1247288 I have relieved myself of all weapons,
1247997 1253419 and, just as you have instructed,<br />I am ready to step outside
1253794 1257298 with my hands raised above my head.
1258841 1261427 <i>I trust, as a representative</i>
1261510 1264889 of the criminal justice system<br />of the United States of America,
1265097 1270853 I shan't be shot down in the street<br />by either you or your deputies
1271061 1273522 before I've had my day in court.
1274148 1275691 You mean, like you did our sheriff?
1276317 1278277 Shot him down like a dog in the street!
1278444 1280571 Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
1280905 1282907 Do I have your word, as a lawman,
1282990 1286327 not to shoot me down<br />like a dog in the street?
1289872 1293375 Well, much as we'd all enjoy<br />seeing something like that,
1293459 1295961 ain't nobody gonna cheat<br />the hangman in my town.
1297421 1299673 Fair enough, marshal. Here we come.
1302218 1303969 They're a little tense out there,
1304470 1307723 so don't make any quick movements<br />and let me do the talking.
1309517 1311018 -[door opening, closing]<br />-Come ahead.
1318067 1320486 -You unarmed?<br />-[Schultz] Yes, indeed we are.
1321862 1324114 Marshal Tatum, may I address you
1324198 1327576 and your deputies, and apparently<br />the entire town of Daughtrey,
1327660 1329578 as to the incident that just occurred?
1331247 1332261 Go on.
1332665 1333679 Thank you.
1334041 1336210 My name is Dr. King Schultz.
1336293 1339338 Like yourself, marshal,<br />I'm a servant of the court.
1339672 1343008 The man lying dead in the dirt,<br />who the good people of Daughtrey
1343092 1347304 saw fit to elect as their sheriff,<br />who went by the name of Bill Sharp,
1347471 1351433 is actually a wanted outlaw<br />by the name of Willard Peck
1352142 1354687 with a price on his head of 200 dollars.
1354937 1357398 Now, that's 200 dollars, dead or alive.
1358107 1359191 The hell you say?
1359859 1363279 I'm aware this is probably<br />disconcerting news,
1363779 1365239 but I'm willing to wager
1365322 1369118 this man was elected sheriff<br />at some time in the past two years?
1370828 1372288 -Yeah.<br />-[Schultz] I know this
1372371 1375082 because three years ago,<br />he was rustling cattle
1375165 1378627 from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company<br />of Lubbock, Texas.
1379128 1381630 Now, this is a warrant
1382006 1388095 made out by circuit court judge<br />Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.
1388721 1390389 You're encouraged to wire him.
1390598 1395436 He'll back up who I am<br />and who your dear departed sheriff was.
1403694 1405070 In other words, marshal...
1405946 1407281 you owe me 200 dollars.

1493158 1494785 The boy's got sand.
1496912 1499832 I got no use for a nigger with sand.
1501583 1504628 I want you to burn a runaway "R"<br />right here on his cheek.

1533198 1535743 there should be some sort<br />of a records office.
1543292 1544960 You know, when she was sold...

1565355 1566565 Were her owners German?
1567024 1568088 Yeah, how you know?
1569109 1570819 She wasn't born<br />on the Carrucan plantation.
1570903 1573238 She was raised<br />by a German mistress. The Von Shafts.
1573405 1574740 She speak a little German, too.
1575574 1577910 -Your wife?<br />-Mm-hmm. When she was little,
1577993 1580662 her mistress taught her, so she'd have<br />someone to speak German with.
1582581 1584041 Well, let me get this straight.
1585334 1589963 Your slave wife speaks German<br />and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?
1590047 1591061 Yep.

1770978 1772229 No appointment, no nothing?
1773021 1774314 Oh, I'm afraid so.
1775148 1777317 Well, what if I was to say<br />I don't like you

1782030 1783490 Now, what you got to say about that?
1786994 1788203 Mr. Bennett...
1789329 1792374 if you are the businessman<br />I've been led to believe you to be,
1792749 1797296 I have 5,000 things I might say<br />that could change your mind.

1801925 1805262 Well, come on inside<br />and get yourself something cool to drink.

1819818 1821903 Maybe while we discuss business,
1821987 1824531 you could provide<br />one of your loveliest black creatures
1824614 1827367 to escort Django, here,<br />around your magnificent grounds.
1827451 1829536 [Big Daddy] Oh, well, absolutely. Betina?

1841006 1843175 -As you please, Big Daddy.<br />-Oh, Mr. Bennett.
1843884 1848430 I must remind you, Django is a free man.<br />He cannot be treated like a slave.
1848555 1850015 Within the bounds of good taste,
1850098 1852309 he must be treated<br />as an extension of myself.
1852851 1854686 [Big Daddy] Understood, Schultz.<br />Betina, sugar?
1854770 1857647 -Yes'm?<br />-Django isn't a slave.
1858315 1860400 Django is a free man, you understand?
1861651 1864154 You can't treat him like any<br />of the other niggers around here,
1864237 1867074 because he ain't like any of the other<br />niggers around here. You got it?
1867366 1869993 You want I should treat him<br />like white folks?
1870369 1871383 No.
1872079 1873246 That's not what I said.
1873580 1875457 Then I don't know<br />what you want, Big Daddy.

2307680 2308932 Who are you two jokers?
2309516 2312352 I am Dr. King Schultz,<br />a legal representative
2312477 2315814 of the criminal justice system<br />of the United States of America.
2315897 2319275 The man to my left is Django Freeman.<br />He's my deputy.
2320068 2321986 In my pocket is a warrant
2322237 2326491 signed by circuit court judge<br />Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas
2326699 2330370 for the arrest and capture, dead or alive,
2330620 2335375 of John Brittle,<br />Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.
2335583 2337126 They were going by the name Shaffer.
2339170 2342257 [Schultz] You know them by the name<br />of Shaffer, but the butchers' real name
2342340 2343354 was Brittle.
2343550 2346886 These are wanted men.<br />The law wants them for murder.
2347095 2348304 Now, I reiterate.
2348721 2351391 The warrant states "dead or alive,"
2351474 2354769 so when Mr. Freeman and myself<br />executed these men on sight,
2354978 2358106 we were operating<br />within our legal boundaries.
2359148 2362944 I realize passions are high...
2364028 2365446 but I must warn you,
2366155 2369284 the penalty for taking deadly force<br />against an officer of the court
2369367 2371119 in the performance of his duty is...
2372036 2373955 you'll be hung by the neck<br />until you're dead.
2377709 2382046 Now, may I please remove the warrant<br />from my pocket so you may examine it?
2384465 2385466 Gimme.
2402066 2403067 Satisfied?
2410199 2411826 May I have that back, please?

2519225 2521853 We're gonna whup<br />that nigger-lover to death.
2522103 2526357 And I'm gonna personally strip and clip<br />that garboon myself.
2530945 2531990 Damn...
2533531 2535742 I can't see fucking shit<br />out of this thing!
2536701 2538161 [Randy] We ready or what?
2538786 2540872 [Big Daddy] Hold on,<br />I'm fucking with my eyeholes.
2541330 2543374 Oh. Oh, shit.
2543875 2545793 I just made it worse.
2545877 2549047 -[Harry] Who made this goddam shit?<br />-[O.B.] Willard's wife.
2549130 2551090 [Willard] Well, make your own<br />goddamn masks!
2551174 2554886 Look, nobody's saying they don't<br />appreciate what Jenny did.
2554969 2557555 [Redfish] If all I had to do<br />was cut a hole in a bag,
2557722 2559474 I could've cut it better than this.
2559682 2561893 [Randy] What about you, Robert?<br />Can you see?
2562351 2563644 [Robert] Not too good.
2564062 2568191 I mean, if I don't move my head,<br />I can see you pretty good, more or less,
2568441 2571861 but when I start riding, the bag's<br />moving all over, and I'm riding blind.
2572028 2572904 Shit.
2574655 2576157 I just made mine worse.
2578451 2579911 Anybody bring any extra bags?
2580161 2583164 [Redfish] No, nobody brought an extra bag!
2583456 2584916 I'm just asking.
2585208 2587001 [O.B.] Do we have to wear them<br />when we ride?
2587126 2588252 Well, shitfire!
2588628 2591589 If you don't wear them as you ride up,<br />that defeats the purpose!
2591672 2593508 [Redfish] Well, I can't see<br />in this fucking thing!
2593716 2596427 I can't breathe and I can't ride<br />in this fucking thing.
2596636 2598638 [Willard] Well, fuck all y'all.<br />I'm going home.
2599263 2601557 Now, I've watched my wife work all day,
2601641 2605394 getting 30 bags together for you<br />ungrateful sons of bitches,
2605478 2608940 and all I can hear is criticize,<br />criticize, criticize.
2609357 2612276 From now on, don't ask me<br />or mine for nothing.
2613903 2616781 Now, look. Let's not forget<br />why we're here.
2616948 2619492 We got a killer nigger<br />over that hill, there.
2620159 2621702 And we gotta make a lesson out of him.
2621786 2624956 Okay, I'm confused.<br />Are the bags on or off?
2625706 2630711 [Robert] I think we all think<br />the bag was a nice idea.
2630837 2633589 -[Randy] Yeah.<br />-[Robert] But, not pointing any fingers...
2634507 2635716 they could have been done better.
2636968 2640012 So, how about no bags this time...
2640888 2645768 but next time, we do the bags right,<br />and then we go full regalia.
2645852 2648229 -[man 1] I like that idea.<br />-[man 2] You get my vote, brother.
2648312 2650982 Wait a minute! I didn't say no bags.
2651649 2653234 But nobody can see.
2654068 2656779 -So?<br />-So, it'd be nice to see.
2657363 2662076 Goddamn it, this is a raid!<br />I can't see, you can't see.
2662285 2665413 So what? All that matters is,<br />can the fucking horse see?
2665746 2666789 That's a raid!
2667373 2669959 -[men shouting]<br />-[Harry] Sons of bitches!
2671043 2672420 I can't see shit!
2673004 2676382 [Big Daddy] There he is.<br />Get that nigger out from under that wagon.
2677425 2679343 And get that nigger-lover<br />out of the wagon!
2679552 2681929 -That nigger ain't down here, Big Daddy!<br />-What?
2682054 2683764 -They tricked us.<br />-Where are they?
2684432 2685433 <i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>
2691189 2693816 -Oh! [laughs]<br />-Bullseye.
2694609 2696485 [men screaming]
2697069 2698196 [Django] Look at them run.
2703326 2705328 Yeah, cowards tend to do that.
2714045 2715087 [Big Daddy] Goddamn it!
2719884 2720968 Would you care to?
2728351 2729977 [Big Daddy] Can't see shit out of this!
2730978 2732521 -He's getting away.<br />-I got him.
2734899 2736609 [Schultz] Big Daddy's getting away.
2736692 2737751 I got him.
2741697 2743366 [bullet whistling]
2743449 2744742 [Big Daddy grunts]
2753125 2754156 Got him.
2756462 2758965 [horse neighing]
2759112 2760132 [chuckles]
2760216 2761676 The kid's a natural.
2772979 2775106 How you know Broomhilda's<br />first masters was German?
2776941 2778359 Broomhilda's a German name.
2779068 2781487 If they named her, it stands<br />to reason they'd be German.
2782238 2784073 Lots of gals where you're from<br />named Broomhilda?
2785199 2787827 Broomhilda is the name of a character
2788244 2791455 in the most popular<br />of all the German legends.
2792415 2793791 There's a story about Broomhilda?
2794417 2795543 Oh, yes, there is.
2802216 2803252 Do you know it?
2803551 2805344 Oh, every German knows that story.
2812101 2813352 Would you like me to tell you?
2814760 2815771 Well...
2817148 2820776 Broomhilda was a... princess.
2822737 2826657 She was a daughter of Wotan,<br />god of all gods.
2827908 2830995 Anyway, her father is really mad at her.
2831287 2832289 What she do?
2833664 2837168 I can't exactly remember.<br />She disobeys him in some way.
2838127 2840838 So, he puts her on top of the mountain.
2841672 2842798 Broomhilda's on a mountain?
2843299 2846635 It's a German legend, there's always going<br />to be a mountain in there somewhere.
2847511 2851015 And he puts a fire-breathing dragon there,<br />to guard the mountain.
2853059 2857855 And he surrounds her<br />in a circle of hellfire.
2859857 2863694 And there, Broomhilda shall remain...
2865363 2870368 unless a hero arises<br />brave enough to save her.
2871577 2872912 Does a fella arise?
2873662 2876123 Yes, Django. As a matter of fact, he does.
2876707 2878501 A fella named Siegfried.
2879293 2880378 Does Siegfried save her?
2883005 2884632 Quite spectacularly so.
2886258 2890179 He scales the mountain<br />because he's not afraid of it.
2891180 2894141 He slays the dragon<br />because he's not afraid of him.
2895559 2897561 And he walks through hellfire...
2900189 2902024 because Broomhilda's worth it.
2906695 2907822 I know how he feel.
2909824 2912284 I think I'm just starting to realize that.
2918165 2922086 Now, look... Django...
2925464 2928926 I don't doubt that, one day,<br />you'll save your lady love.
2930344 2933472 But I can't let you go to Greenville<br />in a good conscience.
2935266 2939228 A slave auction town in Mississippi<br />isn't a place for you to visit.
2939770 2942022 Free or not, it's just too dangerous.
2945693 2947111 But let me ask you a question.
2955077 2957079 How do you like<br />the bounty hunting business?
2959290 2961041 Kill white folks and they pay you for it?
2962418 2963419 What's not to like?
2963794 2965880 Now, I have to admit, we make a good team.
2966464 2969008 I thought you was mad at me<br />for killing Big John and Little Raj.
2969425 2971635 Yeah, on that occasion,<br />you were a tad overzealous,
2971719 2973179 but normally, that's a good thing.
2974638 2976432 How'd you like to partner up<br />for the winter?
2976974 2978184 What you mean, "partner up"?
2979185 2982730 You work with me through the winter<br />till the snow melts...
2984315 2986317 I give you a third of my bounties.
2987526 2991155 So, we make some money this winter,<br />and when the snow melts...
2992072 2993991 I'll take you to Greenville myself...
2994992 2997369 and we'll find where they sent your wife.
3002249 3003584 Why you care what happen to me?
3005711 3007171 Why you care if I find my wife?
3007922 3008957 Frankly...
3010716 3014595 I've never given anybody<br />their freedom before, and now that I have,
3014678 3017014 I feel vaguely responsible for you.
3018557 3020684 Plus, when a German meets<br />a real-life Siegfried,
3020768 3021977 that's kind of a big deal.
3024855 3026982 As a German, I'm obliged to help you
3027066 3029902 on your quest to rescue<br />your beloved Broomhilda.

3172901 3173921 His son's with him.
3174254 3177091 Well, good. He'll have<br />a loved one with him.
3177549 3179385 Maybe even share a last word.
3181845 3183263 That's better than most of them get.
3184056 3185724 Damn sight better than he deserves.
3194483 3195484 Put down the rifle.
3198987 3200239 Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.
3201490 3203492 Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
3207746 3208914 Now, read it aloud.
3209957 3211500 Consider that today's lesson.
3214294 3216422 "Wanted, dead or alive.
3218132 3220968 Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall G..."
3221969 3223262 -Gang.<br />-"...Gang...
3224388 3227891 for murder and stagecoach ro...
3229407 3230519 robbery.
3231186 3233772 -Seven, zero, zero, zero--"<br />-Seven thousand.
3233856 3235023 -Seven?<br />-Thousand.
3235899 3239570 "Seven thousand dollars<br />for Smitty Bacall,
3240028 3246285 One thousand, five hundred dollars<br />for each of his gang..."
3247494 3249705 -Mem...<br />-"...members.
3250789 3255169 Known members of the Smitty Bacall Gang<br />are as follas."
3255377 3256920 -Follows.<br />-"Follows.
3257755 3260382 Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and..."
3262551 3263594 Crazy Craig Koons.
3265304 3267639 That is who Smitty Bacall is.
3268223 3270809 If Smitty Bacall wanted<br />to start a farm at 22,
3270893 3272311 they would never have printed that.
3273437 3276690 But Smitty Bacall wanted<br />to rob stagecoaches,
3277232 3279318 and he didn't mind<br />killing people to do it.
3280527 3283238 Do you want to save your wife<br />by doing what I do?
3284823 3285908 This is what I do.
3286450 3289745 I kill people and sell<br />their corpses for cash.
3290913 3293874 This corpse is worth 7,000 dollars.
3294666 3296502 Now, quit your pussyfooting and shoot him.
3301882 3303258 [horse neighs]

3307010 3308013 [boy] Pa?
3308378 3309431 Pa!
3318565 3322236 Here. You need to keep<br />this Smitty Bacall handbill.
3322528 3324238 -Why?<br />-It's good luck.
3324988 3327115 You always keep the handbill<br />of your first bounty.
3375455 3376832 That's accurate.
3445275 3447903 [Gus] Doctor, Django,<br />how the hell are you?
3449404 3450989 Who the hell have you got there?
3451615 3453450 [Schultz] The Wilson-Lowe Gang.
3454117 3456745 Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?
3457788 3462125 Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby Lowe<br />and three of their acolytes.
3462459 3466046 Huh. Well, just leave them out here.<br />They ain't going nowhere.
3466296 3468215 Why don't you come in<br />out of the snowy snow
3468298 3470008 and get yourselves some coffee?
3470592 3473178 We had a birthday, yesterday.<br />Got some cake.
3473762 3474876 Pretty good.
3497077 3498954 [man 1] Move along! Can't hide!
3508171 3511216 [man 2] Keep moving. Get on up to that<br />auction block.
3513093 3515429 Don't let that mud<br />slow you down. Keep going.
3518849 3519850 [man 3] Come on.
3531945 3532988 [man 4] Keep going.
3535907 3538994 [Schultz] "Broomhilda Von Shaft. Age 27.
3539578 3541079 'R' on right cheek.
3543040 3544916 Calvin Candie."
3545292 3549546 He owns the fourth biggest cotton<br />plantation in Mississippi. Candyland.
3549963 3551002 Candyland?
3551465 3554384 -Oh, you've heard of it!<br />-Ain't no slave ever heard of Candyland.
3554885 3557054 Well, apparently,<br />that's where your wife is...
3557846 3560599 and that's the repellant gentleman<br />who owns her.
3560724 3563143 Let's just hope she works in the house,<br />not the field.
3563351 3564686 Oh, no. She ain't no field nigger.
3565729 3567105 She... She pretty.
3568356 3569691 And she talk good, too.
3571568 3573487 But when they tore her back up,<br />and then they...
3574821 3576531 burned that runaway "R" on her cheek...
3578200 3579409 they goddamned her.
3579993 3582954 [screams]
3583955 3587125 She ain't no field nigger, but she ain't<br />good enough for the house no more, either.
3587834 3591129 -They'll try to make her a comfort girl.<br />-What's a comfort...? Oh.
3592130 3593465 Not while I got freedom.
3595092 3596384 Not while I got my gun.
3599721 3601264 So, do we offer to buy her?
3604309 3605310 So...
3607270 3608355 say...
3611066 3613527 a man wants to buy a horse.
3614236 3615737 Needs to buy a horse.
3617572 3621243 He walks up to the farmer's farm,<br />knocks on the door and asks the farmer
3621326 3624121 to buy his horse. And you know<br />what the farmer says?
3624371 3626206 The farmer says, "No."
3628125 3632254 Well, I say, fuck that farmer.<br />And I'm stealing that horse.
3633130 3635632 Fair enough.<br />But now, you're a horse thief,
3635715 3638760 and they hang horse thieves.<br />Not to mention, the horse goes back
3638844 3641513 to its original owner,<br />because the horse is still his property.
3641763 3645308 We need her and we need a bill of sale.
3645475 3647769 If we ain't gonna try to buy her,<br />how we gonna get her?
3649187 3652691 May I offer an alternative plan of action?
3652980 3654025 Go ahead.
3654693 3655757 So...
3656361 3660782 The man walks up to the farmer's farm,<br />he knocks on the farmer's door...
3661616 3666538 and asks not to buy the horse,<br />but the farm.
3666663 3670250 -Mm-hmm.<br />-And makes an offer so ridiculous,
3670417 3672919 the farmer is forced to say, "Yes."
3673837 3676882 -We gonna offer to buy Candyland?<br />-No, it's far too big.
3676965 3679759 But apparently, this farmer<br />ain't all about the farm.
3681595 3683597 How much do you know<br />about Mandingo fighting?
3683847 3684861 What?
3685048 3689642 Can you convincingly masquerade as someone<br />who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?
3689792 3690812 Why?
3691146 3694900 [Schultz] <i>Because my character is that</i><br /><i>of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf</i>
3694983 3698278 <i>here in Greenville to buy my way</i><br /><i>into the Mandingo fight game.</i>

3719216 3720217 [Schultz] Thank you.
3721593 3723511 You want me to play a black slaver?
3724596 3726473 Ain't nothing lower than a black slaver.
3727557 3730435 A black slaver is lower<br />than the head house nigger.
3731436 3733104 And buddy, that's pretty fucking low.
3734856 3736816 Then play him that way.
3736900 3740779 Give me your black slaver.

3752582 3753833 Dr. Schultz!
3754334 3757212 -Good to see you again.<br />-Mr. Moguy!
3757545 3761383 Thank you for your assistance in creating<br />the opportunity for this appointment.
3761466 3763093 [Leo] Nonsense, it's my job.
3763635 3766513 So, this is the One-Eyed Charly<br />I've heard so much about!
3766596 3768848 Yes, this is Django Freeman.
3769307 3772060 Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,<br />Leonide Moguy.
3772143 3773603 Just call me Leo.
3773895 3777148 Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.<br />You all wanna follow me?
3777649 3780068 [Schultz] How long have you been<br />associated with Mr. Candie?
3780151 3782654 [Leo] Oh, Calvin's father and I<br />were about 11
3782737 3784364 when we went to boarding school together.
3784781 3787659 Calvin's father's father<br />put me through law school.
3787742 3790829 One could almost say I was raised<br />to be Calvin's lawyer.
3790912 3792664 One could almost say youse a nigger.
3793623 3794708 What did you say?
3795292 3797836 -I said--<br />-Nothing, he's just being cheeky.
3798503 3802924 Now, anything else about Mr. Candie<br />that I should know before I meet him?
3803008 3807137 -Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.<br />-[laughs] What civilized people aren't?
3807220 3809597 {\an8}And he prefers Monsieur Candie<br />to Mr. Candie.
3809681 3811808 {\an8}[speaks in French]
3811891 3814728 {\an8}He doesn't speak French.<br />Don't speak French to him,
3814811 3815895 it'll embarrass him.
3817564 3818982 [men grunting]
3819065 3822610 [Candie] Get back on top, now.<br />Turn around. There you go.
3823361 3824529 There you go.
3826698 3829034 Why do you want to get<br />in the Mandingo business?
3831703 3835373 You don't intend to allow your second<br />to make the proper introductions?
3836374 3839669 [Candie] Quit stalling, now.<br />Answer the question.
3840170 3841880 [men continue grunting]
3842297 3843590 The awful truth?
3844466 3847719 I'm bored. This seems<br />like a good bit of fun.
3853391 3855310 Well, come on over.
3855643 3857979 We got us a fight going on<br />that's a good bit of fun.
3860065 3861566 [Amerigo speaking in Italian]
3862025 3863777 Won't you accompany me to the bar?
3872869 3875538 You don't wear a hat in the house,<br />white man. Even I know that.
3875705 3878750 [men grunting]
3880752 3882087 [pool balls clacking]
3884547 3886007 -Dr. Schultz.<br />-What a rare pleasure.
3886091 3889302 -[Candie] Keep fighting, niggers!<br />-And, I might add, an honor.
3889719 3892680 Honor to meet you. Please, have a seat.<br />The pleasure's all mine.
3892764 3895600 Get free man Django, here,<br />whatever he wants.
3896393 3898311 And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.
3916162 3917872 [both yelling]
3918289 3920875 [Candie] Use your weight, boy,<br />use your weight! There you go.
3921584 3923628 He's much bigger and stronger!
3924129 3925338 Come on, now!
3925672 3928299 Ah, he's not doing what I told him,<br />for God's sake!
3928758 3929759 Bravo! Bravo, Luigi!
3929843 3932178 [speaking in Italian]
3932429 3934931 [Candie] Come on, now, boy!<br />It's a fight to the death!
3936558 3938309 You either hit him or are you ain't?
3938560 3942772 [men grunting and roaring]
3942856 3945567 [speaking in Italian]
3946526 3948611 Big Fred, come on!
3949487 3951322 [Candie] Turn him around! Now, come...
3954826 3956494 Use your strength, boy!
3957203 3958997 Come on, now! Use your strength!
3961291 3962417 There you go.
3964419 3965587 There you go!
3965962 3966963 Look at that.
3967922 3970175 See, I told you to put<br />some more power in there.
3971176 3972677 Do what I told you, boy.
3973428 3974762 There you go.
3974971 3976014 No.
3976306 3979017 [Candie] Do what I told you!<br />Blind him black, boy!
3979225 3980518 Blind him black!
3980977 3982729 [Luigi screams]
3982896 3984230 Oh, no, Luigi.
3984439 3986274 [Luigi screams]
3986566 3987567 [Candie] Yeah!
3988693 3992113 [whoops]
3993072 3994157 [sighs]
3994449 3997285 [panting]
3999537 4001539 [Luigi screaming]
4005102 4006169 Finish him.
4006628 4010006 [Luigi continues screaming]
4010798 4012050 Go on, boy, finish him.
4013885 4015386 -[hammer thuds]<br />-[Luigi is silent]
4016721 4020350 [Leo] That's why they call him Big Fred.<br />Worth every penny.
4020433 4022143 Well, <i>arrivederci, </i>Luigi!
4022352 4027190 Come on up, now, boy. Get yourself a rest.<br />You did a fine job. A real fine job.

4055176 4057095 [indistinct chatter]
4062183 4063268 What's your name?
4066020 4067059 Django.
4069732 4070942 Can you spell it?
4073486 4077615 D-J-A-N-G-O.
4079284 4080451 The D is silent.
4081202 4082224 I know.
4089252 4090545 [Amerigo speaking in Italian]
4090628 4093965 [Candie] Mr. Moguy, I want you<br />to take care of my new boy, here.
4094132 4098219 You find him a room with a soft bed,<br />then bring him up a pony to lick his pole.
4098761 4101598 But you be ready to travel to Candyland<br />tomorrow morning, now, you hear?
4101681 4104183 -Yes, sir, Monsieur Candie.<br />-Before you go... Roscoe,
4104350 4106352 get Fred here a tall beer.
4110648 4113359 You enjoy that, boy. You've earned it.
4113735 4114744 Yes, sir.
4124370 4125788 What's your name, boy?
4126164 4128166 His name is Django Freeman.
4128374 4129423 [Candie chuckles]
4131836 4133129 Where'd you dig him up?
4133546 4136716 A fortuitous turn of events<br />brought Django and myself together.
4138635 4140094 I've heard tell about you.
4141346 4144474 I heard you been telling everybody<br />them Mandingos ain't no damn good,
4144557 4147602 ain't nothing nobody is selling<br />is worth buying. I'm curious.
4148353 4150355 What makes you such a Mandingo expert?
4152899 4155026 I'm curious what makes you so curious.
4158571 4160448 -What did you say, boy?<br />-Calm down, Butch.
4161699 4162909 No offense given.
4163660 4164674 None taken.
4164994 4166204 [Schultz] Monsieur Candie,
4166788 4170583 I'd appreciate if you could<br />direct your line of inquiry toward me.
4170750 4171798 One...
4172794 4175963 you do not have anything to drink.<br />Can I get you a tasty refreshment?
4176047 4178841 -Yes. I'll have a beer.<br />-Wonder-bar!
4179092 4183179 Roscoe, a beer for the man with the beard,<br />and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver.
4183262 4184555 Do not spare the rum.
4185181 4186195 Doc...
4187433 4190978 I am a seasoned slaver.<br />You are... Well, you are a neophyte.
4191062 4195566 I'm simply trying to ascertain if this<br />cowboy, here, is taking advantage of you.
4197443 4200363 With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...
4201406 4203116 I didn't seek you out for your advice.
4203491 4205660 I sought you out to purchase<br />a fighting nigger
4205743 4207704 at above top-dollar market price.
4208413 4211165 I was under the impression,<br />when you granted me an audience,
4211249 4213126 it would be to discuss business.
4216421 4218131 Well, we weren't talking business yet.
4218923 4221050 We were discussing my curiosity.
4223383 4224429 Thank you.
4224512 4227098 [Candie] Roscoe, Coco,<br />go outside and play.
4229350 4232019 Sheba, you stay right there.
4233020 4234522 I know you didn't mean me.
4236357 4237358 <i>Prost!</i>
4237984 4239002 German.
4239736 4241070 Now, according to Moguy,
4241654 4245533 if I do business with you,<br />I'm doing business with both y'all.
4246033 4248327 He does the eyeballing,<br />you the billfold? Is that it?
4248703 4252331 [chuckling] Well, you don't make it sound<br />too flattering, but more or less, yeah.
4252623 4253655 Hmm.
4254834 4255850 So...
4256502 4260339 Bright Boy, Moguy tells me<br />you looked over my African flesh
4260423 4262091 and you was none too impressed, huh?
4262633 4263760 Not for top dollar.
4266429 4268139 Then we got nothing more to talk about.
4268514 4270808 You see, you wanna buy<br />a beat-ass nigger from me,
4270892 4272977 those are the beat-ass niggers<br />I wanna sell, so...
4273186 4275146 He don't wanna buy the niggers<br />you wanna sell.
4276063 4278941 He wants the nigger you don't wanna sell.
4279484 4283488 Well, I don't sell the niggers<br />I don't wanna sell.
4286073 4289410 Well, you won't sell your best.
4289827 4291746 You won't even sell your second best.
4292413 4295750 But your third best? You don't want<br />to sell him either,
4296334 4299879 but if I made you an offer so ridiculous<br />you'd be forced to consider it...
4300797 4302965 [laughing] ...who knows what could happen?
4305510 4307386 And what do you consider ridiculous?
4308721 4312475 For a truly talented specimen?<br />The right nigger?
4314602 4316103 How much would you say, Django?
4319941 4321275 Twelve thousand dollars.
4322318 4323528 [Candie slurps]
4326364 4329617 Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,
4330326 4331702 but now, you have my attention.
4346050 4348010 [Candie] Willie? Willie.
4348469 4350012 Hold up. Hold up.
4350638 4352974 -Ah.<br />-Good morning, gentlemen.
4353057 4356018 Good Dr. Schultz.<br />Beautiful morning, isn't it?
4356602 4358104 You couldn't have picked a better one.
4358437 4361357 Please, won't you take a ride with us<br />here in the victoria?
4361566 4363067 [Schultz] Oh, thank you very much.
4363150 4365069 [Candie] You can tie<br />your horse up back there.
4373536 4374577 Django?
4379417 4383129 Where I part company from many<br />of my phrenologist colleagues
4383421 4385965 is I believe there is<br />a level above bright...
4386924 4392054 above talented, above loyal,<br />that a nigger can aspire to.
4393180 4397143 Say, one nigger<br />that just pops up in 10,000.
4397852 4399103 The exceptional nigger.
4400438 4402148 Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?
4403524 4404609 The sun is up.
4405860 4407486 It's shining on all of us.
4412575 4413618 Have a seat, doc.
4414744 4416704 Thank you. Quite an honor.
4416954 4418706 The honor is all ours. Thank you.
4418956 4420917 -[Schultz] Thank you.<br />-[Candie] <i>But I do believe that,</i>
4421000 4422168 <i>given time,</i>
4422460 4425046 exceptional niggers<br />like Bright Boy, here...
4426297 4427965 become, if not frequent...
4429383 4430551 more frequent.
4432929 4433964 Right, boy?
4435097 4437016 You are that one in 10,000.
4437600 4440436 The name of the game is keep up,<br />not catch up, nigger.
4441062 4442271 [men laughing]
4453199 4454659 -Whoa!<br />-[horse neighs]
4456577 4459163 -Touch your guns, you die.<br />-[Candie] Everybody calm down.
4459872 4461999 Now, I saw the whole thing. No harm done.
4462083 4465252 -Are you kidding me? This nigger just--<br />-I said, no harm done!
4465461 4467338 Now, take your hand off your pistol!
4468923 4471509 Butch, that means you, too.
4473010 4475221 Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.
4477390 4479725 Hoot, get back up on your horse.
4480518 4482019 [Hoot] He broke my collarbone.
4482103 4484689 For God's sake,<br />somebody please help Hoot, here,
4484772 4486524 back up on his goddamn horse.
4486857 4489652 -[Nick] Yes, sir, boss.<br />-Oh, you are one lucky nigger.
4491028 4492905 You better listen to your boss, white boy.
4492989 4495116 Oh, I'm gonna go walking<br />in the moonlight with you.
4495574 4496784 You wanna hold my hand?

4592213 4593422 Indeed!
4596092 4599345 May we stop for a moment so I may<br />put a word in my man's ear?
4599887 4603349 I'm expecting to fall in love<br />once I see the specimens at Candyland,
4603474 4606644 so before that moment,<br />it would be good if I could have
4606727 4610815 a confidential strategy meeting<br />with my confidant.
4614193 4615903 You mind telling me<br />what the hell you doing?
4616028 4617863 I confirmed that Broomhilda's<br />at Candyland.
4622201 4624870 -You're sure it's her?<br />-He didn't call her by name,
4624954 4627248 but she's a young lady,<br />whip marks on her back
4627331 4630376 and speaks German.<br />Now, while it's not wise to assume,
4630459 4633963 in this instance, I think<br />it's pretty safe. Point being...
4634839 4637424 don't get so carried away<br />with your retribution.
4638050 4639718 You lose sight of why we're here.
4639927 4643931 -You think I lost sight of that?<br />-Yes, I do. Stop antagonizing Candie.
4644640 4649645 You're going to blow this whole charade,<br />or, more than likely, get us both killed.
4649728 4654567 And I, for one, don't intend to die<br />in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, U.S.A.
4654900 4657611 I'm not antagonizing him.<br />I'm intriguing him.
4658154 4660322 You're yelling abuse at these poor slaves.
4661365 4662575 I recall the man...
4663701 4666620 who had me kill another man<br />in front of his son,
4667121 4668330 and he didn't bat a eye.
4670121 4671167 You remember that?
4673627 4674795 Yeah, of course I remember.
4674879 4677840 What you said was that this is my world.
4679508 4681135 And in my world, you gotta get dirty.
4682553 4685014 So, that's what I'm doing.<br />I'm getting dirty.
4689143 4692146 Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...
4693647 4695024 that was the general gist.
4699612 4700779 See you at Candyland.
4708662 4710998 [Django] All right, niggers. Back at it.
4712583 4714168 That means you too, Moonlight.
4734855 4736774 [dogs barking]
4761715 4762841 [Candie] I'll be.
4763300 4764301 D'Artagnan!
4765219 4768180 Now, boy, why do a fool thing<br />like run off?
4768472 4770766 I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.
4770849 4772101 [Candie] Yes, you can.
4772434 4774812 You might not be able to win,<br />but your ass can fight.
4775896 4778399 Mr. Stonesipher, would you please<br />shut these goddamn dogs up?
4778524 4779817 I cannot hear myself think!
4779900 4782152 Quieten down, Marsha! Marsha, hush up!
4782236 4784280 -[Marsha barks]<br />-[Stonesipher] Marsha! Hush up!
4784697 4787825 Hey! Get these goddamn dogs<br />away from this nigger!
4788409 4790577 [dogs whimpering]
4797251 4798502 Well, now, boy...
4799712 4801797 -get on out that tree.<br />-[D'Artagnan] Yes, sir.
4802965 4806302 [dogs barking]
4825070 4826447 How long was he loose?
4827573 4829658 A night. Day.
4830826 4831994 Half the other night.
4833579 4835039 How far he get off the property?
4835456 4836915 About 20 miles off prop.
4837458 4839626 Pretty far, considering that limp he got.
4842254 4845341 Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan<br />supposed to fight on Friday?
4845549 4846884 One of this new lot.
4848552 4851305 Way he looks now, a blind Indian<br />wouldn't bet a bead on him.
4851472 4854141 [D'Artagnan] Please, Monsieur Candie,<br />I ain't got it in me no more.
4854224 4857227 Now, now, now. Now, no begging.
4858479 4860314 No playing on my soft heart.
4864276 4866487 -You in trouble now, son.<br />-Yes, sir.
4869615 4872701 You know, I done paid 500 dollars for you.
4873410 4875621 When I pay 500 dollars,
4876246 4878332 I expect to get five fights<br />out of a nigger
4878415 4880626 -before he roll over and play dead.<br />-Sir...
4881126 4883921 You got to understand,<br />I'm running a business here.
4885089 4888008 -You fought three fights.<br />-But I won every one!
4888092 4890511 Yes, you did. Yes, you did.<br />But that last one,
4890594 4892679 you muddled the line<br />between winning and losing.
4896392 4897893 Still, the fact remains.
4898644 4901939 I pay 500 dollars,<br />I want five goddamn fights.
4902773 4904525 So, what about my 500 dollars, huh?
4906944 4908404 What about my 500 dollars?
4910364 4911615 You gonna reimburse me?
4918038 4919832 You even know what "reimburse" means?
4919915 4922376 [all laughing]
4928590 4930092 [Schultz] I'll reimburse you.
4934263 4935263 You will?
4936354 4937391 Yep.
4940769 4942896 You'll pay 500 dollars...
4943689 4947234 for practically a one-eyed old Joe<br />ain't fit to push a broom?
4947484 4948485 No, he won't.
4950821 4952573 He just tired of you<br />toying with him, is all.
4953907 4955159 Matter of fact, so am I.
4956326 4958203 But we ain't paying a penny<br />for that piccaninny.
4958537 4960372 Ain't got no use for him.<br />Ain't that right, doc?
4962207 4963250 You heard him.
4972801 4976638 You're gonna have to excuse<br />Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.
4977556 4980058 He ain't never seen a nigger like you<br />ever in his life.
4980934 4982561 Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?
4985230 4986275 That's right.
4987524 4988692 [Candie] For that matter...
4990224 4991361 nor have I.
4997826 4998952 Now,
5000078 5003123 seeing as you won't pay a penny<br />for this piccaninny, here...
5005959 5008795 you won't mind me handling this nigger<br />any way I see fit?
5010339 5011507 He's your nigger.
5015594 5017346 Mr. Stonesipher?
5018764 5021725 Let Marsha and her bitches<br />send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
5022392 5024186 [Stonesipher] Marsha!
5024645 5026230 Marsha, get him!
5026522 5029024 [dogs barking]
5029274 5030484 Get him, get him!
5032069 5034404 [all whooping]
5041370 5042788 [D'Artagnan screaming]
5051338 5053257 [screaming continues]
5064726 5066979 Your boss looks a little green<br />around the gills
5067062 5068981 for a blood sport like nigger-fighting.
5069147 5070190 No.
5070732 5073777 He just ain't used to seeing a man<br />ripped apart by dogs, is all.
5074570 5075637 Mm.
5076738 5077781 You are used to it?
5078407 5081076 I'm just a little more used<br />to Americans than he is.
5081410 5083245 -[Candie] Huh.<br />-Now,
5083745 5085581 [in French accent] Monsieur Candie...
5086231 5087549 [in normal voice] whenever you're ready.
5088250 5090419 We rode five hours<br />so you could show off your stock.
5091545 5092796 Let's get to it.
5094631 5096425 Because as of now, if he's an example...
5097426 5098468 I ain't impressed.
5101060 5102097 Follow me.
5122659 5123666 [clicks tongue]
5220006 5222092 [Jessie] Line them up<br />to the left here, now, boy.
5224177 5225387 Stand up straight, now!
5226596 5227618 Get up there.
5228098 5230308 Get up there, boy. Come on.
5230559 5232519 I said give me a line! Give me a line!
5232602 5234563 Get in line, there! Straighten up!
5289951 5292245 [Candie and Leo speaking indistinctly]
5294289 5296792 -[Candie] Hello! Stephen, my boy!<br />-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5297209 5298502 Hello, my ass.
5299002 5301922 Who this nigger up on that nag?
5302005 5303882 Oh, Stephen, you have<br />nails for breakfast?
5304299 5306051 What's the matter? Why you so ornery?
5306134 5308094 -You miss me, huh?<br />-[laughing] Oh, yes, sir.
5308220 5311681 I miss you like a hog miss slop.
5311848 5315936 -Like a baby miss mammy's titty.<br />-[both laugh]
5316019 5319856 I miss you like I misses<br />a rock in my shoe.
5319940 5321900 [laughs]
5322275 5326822 Now, I asked you,<br />who this nigger on that nag?
5326905 5327977 Hey, Snowball.
5329908 5333161 Wanna know my name<br />or the name of my horse, you ask me.
5333495 5336373 [Stephen] Just who the hell<br />you calling "Snowball," horse boy?
5336456 5339501 I'll snatch your black ass off that nag<br />down here in the mud so fast,
5339584 5342045 -make your head spin.<br />-Whoa, whoa! Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.
5342254 5345632 Let's keep it funny. Django here's a<br />Freeman.
5346633 5348552 -This nigger here?<br />-That nigger there.
5348885 5352305 Let me at least introduce<br />the two of you. Django?
5352472 5355350 This is another cheeky black bugger<br />like yourself, Stephen.
5355475 5357060 Stephen, this here's Django.
5357310 5358770 You two ought to hate each other.
5358854 5363024 Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger<br />you feels the need to entertain?
5363108 5367028 Django and his friend in gray here,<br />Dr. Schultz, are customers.
5367195 5368738 And they are our guests, Stephen.
5368822 5372409 And you, you old, decrepit bastard,<br />ought to show them hospitality.
5372492 5374911 -You understand that?<br />-[Stephen] Yes, sir. Him, I understand.
5374995 5377247 But I don't know why I got to take<br />lip off this nigger.
5377330 5379374 You don't have to know why.<br />Do you understand?
5380542 5383003 -Yes, sir. I understand.<br />-Well, good.
5383753 5386673 They're spending the night. Go up<br />in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.
5387883 5389509 He gonna stay in the Big House?
5389759 5392262 Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.
5392345 5394931 -In the Big House?<br />-You got a problem with that?
5395015 5397475 No, I ain't got no problem with it.
5397559 5399686 If you ain't got no problem<br />burning the bed, the sheets
5399769 5402105 and everything else<br />when this black-ass motherfucker's gone!
5402188 5404357 That is my problem. They are mine to burn.
5404524 5406943 Now, your problem, right now,<br />is making a good impression.
5407027 5409112 I want you to start<br />solving that problem, right now,
5409195 5410530 and get them goddamn rooms ready!
5412908 5414242 Yes, sir, Monsieur Candie.
5415994 5417065 [Candie] Go on, now.
5418246 5420582 [Stephen] Can't believe you brought<br />a nigger to stay in the Big House.
5420874 5423710 -Your daddy rolling over in his grave.<br />-Man, the lip on him.
5423793 5426880 -[Stephen muttering indistinctly]<br />-Phew! He's getting worse and worse. Now!
5427213 5431593 [screaming] Where is my beautiful sister?
5432218 5433470 There she is!
5433678 5435555 [Candie whooping]
5435680 5439100 Dr. Schultz,<br />this attractive Southern belle
5439184 5440477 is my widowed sister.
5440769 5444397 Darling, you are a tonic for tired eyes.
5445815 5449361 May I present to you<br />Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly?
5449527 5452906 Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.<br />Y'all get over by that pen.
5452989 5455575 -[Tommy] Come on, Charly. Go on.<br />-[Bill] Let's go. Come on, now.
5455659 5457702 You know where it is. Like you on a rope.
5459329 5461831 [Tommy] Niggers don't walk<br />around here, niggers run.
5462624 5464000 [Schultz] Ah, Monsieur Candie?
5464167 5465177 [Candie] Mm?
5467087 5469696 About that matter, about the nigger girl<br />you were talking about?
5469921 5470966 Nigger gal?
5471049 5474344 Yeah, I believe you mentioned<br />she spoke German.
5474636 5476805 Ah, yes, Hildi! What about her?
5477222 5481518 Do you think, before the demonstration,<br />you could send her around to my room?
5481935 5485855 You little dickens, you! [laughs]<br />I don't see why not.
5485939 5488400 Stephen, when you get through<br />showing them to their rooms,
5488483 5491361 go fetch Hildi, get her cleaned up<br />and smelling real nice,
5491444 5494823 -and sent over to Dr. Schultz's room here.<br />-[laughs] Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,
5494948 5497325 there's something I ain't<br />told you about, yet.
5497701 5501162 -What?<br />-Uh... Hildi in the hot box.
5503039 5505917 -[Candie] What's she doing there?<br />-[Stephen] What you think she doing there
5506001 5507919 in the hot box? She being punished.
5508586 5510714 -[Candie] What she do?<br />-[Stephen] She run off again.
5511131 5514092 Jesus Christ, Stephen!<br />How many people ran away while I was gone?
5514175 5516553 -Two.<br />-When did she go?
5516636 5519014 Last night.<br />They brung her back this morning.
5519931 5522475 How bad did Stonesipher's dogs<br />tear her up?
5523143 5526521 [Stephen] Lucky for her, they was out<br />chasing D'Artagnan's ass.
5526730 5529858 Bill and Cody went looking for her,<br />found her, brung her back.
5531067 5532444 -Now, she a little beat up.<br />-Mm.
5532527 5535405 But she done that to her own damn self,<br />running through them bushes.
5535488 5537115 [Candie] How long she been in the box?
5537240 5540201 [Stephen] How long do you think<br />she been in there? All damn day.
5540452 5543079 And the little bitch got<br />10 more days be in there.
5543747 5546291 -Still, take her out.<br />-Take her out? Why?
5546458 5548334 Because I said so, that's why.
5548460 5551588 Dr. Schultz is my guest.<br />Hildi is my nigger.
5551671 5554841 Southern hospitality dictates<br />I make her available to him.
5554924 5558094 -But Monsieur Candie, she run off.<br />-Jesus Christ, Stephen.
5558178 5560889 What is the point of having a nigger<br />that speaks German
5560972 5563433 if you can't wheel them out when you have<br />a German guest?
5563516 5565727 -I...<br />-Now, I realize it is inconvenient,
5565852 5567604 but still, you take her ass out.
5567812 5568843 Yes, sir.
5570273 5572942 [Candie] Lara Lee, will you<br />and Cora be responsible
5573026 5576613 for getting Hildi cleaned up<br />and presentable for Dr. Schultz, here?
5576988 5579866 -[Lara] Of course, darling.<br />-Now, gentlemen, I do apologize,
5579949 5583078 but I am weary from our travels<br />beyond words.
5583203 5585663 It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.
5588625 5589876 [clicking tongue]
5590877 5593546 Y'all done heard the man!<br />Get her ass up out of there!
5593963 5595590 Cora, come here.
5596591 5599844 Get over there, get her cleaned up,<br />bring her back over here to Dr....
5599928 5602347 -What'd you say your name is? Shoots?<br />-Schultz.
5602430 5604891 Schultz. Get her back<br />over here. Hurry up, girl.
5604974 5606049 Yes, sir.
5649144 5651646 [Broomhilda screaming]
5652021 5654440 [Hoot] Come on, girl. Stand up.
5655692 5656901 [Broomhilda] No!
5657527 5658820 [gasping]
5665869 5666995 [screams]
5667745 5669956 [Broomhilda screaming]
5684637 5688016 Is you coming with me, or is you gonna<br />sleep in that little box over yonder?
5691019 5693938 ["Ancora Qui" by Elisa playing]
5775520 5776620 [Lara exhales]
5783278 5784654 Hello, ladies.
5784904 5788116 Dr. Schultz.<br />May I introduce to you Broomhilda?
5792495 5794289 Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.
5796374 5798251 It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.
5799752 5801838 I've heard a lot of good things about you.
5802130 5805008 Well, it's not every nigger<br />speaks German, don't you know.
5805300 5806592 [both chuckle]
5808261 5810179 [Schultz] As I look<br />at you now, Broomhilda,
5810722 5814851 I can see all the passions you inspire<br />are completely justified.
5818771 5820690 The doctor here speaks German.
5823026 5824902 And I've been informed you do as well?
5826487 5828323 Go ahead, girl. Speak a little German.
5830700 5834370 {\an8}[speaking in German]
5835288 5837290 [Lara laughs]
5837373 5838624 Astonishing.
5839083 5840585 {\an8}[speaking in German]
5846007 5847884 -And I shall bring--<br />-[Schultz] Much obliged.
5854182 5856059 {\an8}[speaking in German]
5857560 5858654 <i>Ja.</i>
5879457 5880917 [speaking in German]
5882210 5883294 Don't be afraid.
5886922 5887965 {\an8}[speaking in German]
5921749 5922821 Hmm.
5923042 5924061 <i>Pardon.</i>
5927630 5928798 {\an8}[speaking in German]
5931926 5933005 <i>Danke.</i>
5942145 5945565 {\an8}[speaking in German]
5976554 5977930 {\an8}[laughs]
6021349 6023309 <i>Ich verspreche es.</i>
6038699 6039951 Hey, Little Trouble Maker.
6040451 6041452 [gasps]
6044705 6045873 [sighs]
6049252 6051712 You silver-tongued devil, you.
6053548 6055258 -Hurry up, girl.<br />-These ready, Miss Cora.
6055341 6056842 No, no, no. They drinking, tonight.
6056926 6059679 Go downstairs, get the big jug<br />with the red stuff Monsieur Candie like.
6059762 6062848 Get your pretty ass out the way. You know<br />you like it.
6062974 6065726 That's because you knows<br />what I like. [laughs]
6065810 6067812 [Cora] Ooh! Come on<br />with these biscuits, girl.
6067937 6071691 Look, Monsieur Candie,<br />they were all fine specimens,
6071774 6072900 no doubt about it.
6073818 6077697 But the best three by far were Samson...
6079115 6080700 -What's that other one's name?<br />-Goldie.
6081158 6082261 Goldie,
6082451 6083953 and Eskimo Joe.
6084704 6087123 By the way, why is he called "Eskimo" Joe?
6087498 6090459 You never know how these<br />nigger nicknames get started.
6090710 6093838 His name was Joe, maybe one day<br />he said he was cold. Who knows?
6093921 6095881 [all laughing]
6097216 6100094 Well, regardless, Samson's your best.
6100803 6101971 We all know that.
6102597 6104932 You will never sell him,<br />and I can see why.
6105099 6106392 He's a champion.
6106475 6109645 Mm-mm-mm. All three are champions.
6110813 6111856 Samson's the champion.
6113065 6114150 Them other two pretty good.
6116152 6118946 -Calvin, what's this nigger you let--?<br />-It's all right, it's all right.
6119030 6120823 You have to understand, Monsieur Candie,
6121157 6124785 while admittedly a neophyte<br />in the nigger-fight game,
6124910 6129206 I do have a little bit of a background<br />in the European traveling circus.
6129290 6130309 Is that right?
6130583 6134545 [Schultz] Hence, I have big ideas when it<br />comes to presentation.
6135212 6136964 -Mm.<br />-[Schultz] I need something more
6137048 6138215 than just a big nigger.
6140468 6142470 Yeah, he needs to have panache.
6142637 6144972 -Need to have what? What?<br />-Panache. Uh...
6146015 6148601 -A sense of showmanship.<br />-Showmanship, yes.
6148684 6152063 I want to be able to bill him<br />as the Black Hercules.
6152146 6153731 [all laughing]
6153814 6156567 -The Black Hercules! Isn't that clever?<br />-More like Nigger-les.
6156651 6158694 [all laughing]
6159028 6160613 I said, and I quote...
6161530 6166827 "I would pay top dollar<br />for the right nigger."
6167703 6170998 Now, I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe<br />is the wrong nigger, per se.
6172124 6174418 But is he right as rain?
6176170 6181467 Oh, Dr. Schultz, I will have you know<br />there is no-one in the nigger-fight game
6181550 6185471 that appreciates the value of showmanship<br />more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie.
6185554 6186593 Nobody.
6186847 6188891 But one must not forget<br />the most important thing
6188974 6190476 -in the nigger-fight game.<br />-Mm-hmm.
6190559 6193479 -And that is a nigger that can win fights.<br />-Mm-hmm.
6193854 6198025 Now, that should be your first,<br />second, third, fourth and fifth concern.
6198442 6200736 Now, after you have that,<br />and you know you have that,
6200820 6203739 then you can start to implement<br />a grand design.
6204657 6207368 In other words, first thing is first.
6207451 6208828 First thing's first.
6213874 6215835 [whispering in German]
6216001 6219505 -[chuckles]<br />-Ooh! I see you two getting on.
6220589 6221632 Famously!
6222967 6224802 Oh, Monsieur Candie, you cannot imagine
6224885 6228848 what it's like not to hear<br />your native tongue in four years.
6228931 6231100 Well, hell, I can't imagine<br />two weeks in Boston!
6231183 6233269 -[all laughing]<br />-[Stephen howls with laughter]
6233394 6236897 Two weeks in Boston!<br />[laughs] Monsieur Candie, you a mess.
6236981 6239859 [laughs] Two weeks in Boston!
6240276 6245573 [Schultz] I can't express the joy I felt<br />conversing in my mother tongue.
6245698 6249910 And Hildi is a charming<br />conversation companion.
6250077 6251954 [Candie] Well, be careful, now,<br />Dr. Schultz.
6252413 6254915 You might've caught yourself<br />a little dose of nigger-love.
6255291 6257626 -Nigger-love's a powerful emotion, boy.<br />-[Stephen] Mm!
6257710 6261130 It's like a pool of black tar.<br />Once it catches your ass, you caught.
6261213 6264091 Yes, sir, you stuck. [chuckles]
6264258 6265509 [Lara] I don't know, doctor.
6266051 6268763 You can lay on all the German<br />sweet talk you want, but...
6269096 6272683 it looks like this pony's<br />got big eyes for Django.
6273392 6274935 [Lara chuckles]
6275394 6277938 Well, naturally!
6278105 6283110 It is the soaring eagle that attracts<br />her attention, not the plucked chicken.
6283235 6284653 [all chuckling]
6284820 6287531 [Candie] Dr. Schultz, don't be<br />so down on yourself.
6287615 6289450 You are quite<br />the dapper European gentleman.
6289533 6292953 [Cora] You got to clean these dishes.<br />Put your elbow in these dishes, you hear?
6293037 6294663 You know that nigger, don't you?
6296081 6297333 -Who?<br />-"Who?"
6297458 6299919 Don't "who" me, bitch.<br />You know who I'm talking about.
6302463 6303464 At the table?
6304423 6305591 I don't know him.
6305966 6307384 You don't know him.
6307885 6309887 -No.<br />-"No," what?
6310679 6311701 No, sir.
6314058 6315643 [chuckles]
6316727 6318437 You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?
6322525 6324068 [tuts] Okay.
6325903 6328614 Yeah. If you say so.
6335037 6338332 Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,<br />no doubt about it.
6340125 6341335 But if it was my money...
6343212 6345256 I wouldn't pay no 12,000 dollars for him.
6345548 6347091 What would your price be?
6348008 6349885 Well, if I was inclined to be generous,
6349969 6353055 and I don't know why<br />I would be inclined to be generous...
6354515 6355558 nine thousand.
6357059 6358143 Maybe.
6358864 6359895 [Candie] Dr. Schultz.
6360938 6364650 Let me re-clarify how this whole<br />negotiation came about.
6365234 6367314 It wasn't me who came to you<br />to sell a nigger.
6367414 6368237 Sure wasn't.
6368320 6371073 -It was you who approached me to buy one.<br />-Sure was.
6371282 6374118 [Candie] That 9,000 dollars Bright Boy's<br />been bandying about
6374201 6377246 ain't too far off. If I wanted to sell<br />Eskimo Joe for that
6377329 6379540 -I could do so any day of the week.<br />-Any day.
6380207 6383836 But like you said in Greenville, doctor,<br />I don't wanna sell him.
6384837 6389133 It was only your ridiculous offer<br />of 12,000 dollars
6389216 6391385 -that made me even consider it.<br />-Mm-hm.
6400185 6404231 You know, Monsieur Candie,<br />you do possess the power of persuasion.
6404732 6405733 [chuckles]
6407857 6408944 [Schultz bangs table]
6409028 6413073 Why not? Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.<br />Eskimo Joe, 12,000 dollars.
6413157 6416452 Hooray, doctor. Hooray.<br />And a wise decision that is.
6416535 6419914 However, that is a tremendous<br />amount of money.
6420247 6423417 And the way you have your Mr. Moguy,<br />I have a lawyer.
6423584 6425336 Persnickety man named Tuttle.
6425628 6428839 And I would need my Mr. Tuttle<br />to draw up a legal contract
6428923 6432384 before I'd feel comfortable exchanging<br />that amount of money for flesh.
6432468 6435137 -Mm-hmm.<br />-Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined
6435220 6436555 by a physician of my choosing.
6436639 6441727 -[Candie] Naturally.<br />-So, say I return in about...
6444772 6446815 -five days' time.<br />-Five days?
6447149 6448525 With my Mr. Tuttle.
6448651 6450819 And then my Mr. Tuttle and your Mr. Moguy
6450903 6453197 can hash out the finer details<br />between themselves.
6454657 6457326 I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.
6458369 6459476 Gentlemen...
6460663 6462289 may I propose a toast?
6464917 6466377 To Eskimo Joe.
6466543 6470130 Or shall we call him the Black Hercules?
6470214 6472716 -[all laughing]<br />-[Schultz] To the Black Hercules.
6472841 6475886 -[Stephen] The Black Hercules!<br />-The Black Hercules.
6475970 6478931 You was right, doctor.<br />That name do have pan-ass.
6479014 6480140 [chuckles]
6480224 6484311 Mm. Hildi? Top my drink off.
6487940 6491819 So, Hildi, how you like serving<br />at the big table in the Big House, huh?
6492987 6495447 When Monsieur Candie<br />talk to you, you answers.
6496448 6498617 -I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.<br />-[Candie] Mm-hmm!
6499326 6501245 It's better than sizzling in that hot box
6501328 6503580 or dragging your ass<br />through a bramble bush.
6503872 6507042 Maybe not quite as much fun as getting<br />to pleasure all them Mandingos,
6507126 6508919 -huh, sugar bear?<br />-She like them niggers.
6509003 6510963 -Like Samson? Huh?<br />-[Broomhilda] No, sir.
6511880 6515759 You know, Monsieur Candie, the doctor here<br />might be interested in seeing
6515968 6519138 Hildi's peeled back, seeing as how<br />they don't have many niggers
6519221 6520222 where he come from.
6520556 6522975 Dr. Schultz, when you was alone<br />with Hildi, here,
6523058 6526311 did you just speak German,<br />or did you get to take her clothes off?
6526395 6530065 -No, we just talked, and--<br />-[Candie] So you haven't seen her back?
6530352 6531400 I haven't.
6531692 6534695 No, no, no. Stephen's right,<br />you might find this interesting.
6534778 6538532 Hildi, take off your dress.<br />Show Dr. Schultz your back, here. Go on.
6538615 6542536 [Lara] Uh... Calvin! I just got her<br />all dressed up and looking nice.
6542619 6545748 [Candie] But, Lara Lee,<br />Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf!
6545831 6548792 They don't got niggers there.<br />He is a man of medicine.
6548876 6551503 I'm sure it would fascinate him,<br />the nigger's endurance for pain.
6551795 6555132 These niggers are tough,<br />Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.
6555257 6557760 Hildi's got something like<br />four lashes on her back.
6557843 6560095 Lara Lee just get one,<br />she'd lose her goddamn mind.
6560179 6562181 Look at that, doctor.<br />It's like a painting.
6562306 6563348 [shouting] Calvin!
6564349 6567227 [whispering] We are eating. Ain't no-one<br />wanna look at her whipped-up back.
6569313 6570981 Fine. Fine, fine, fine.
6571690 6573984 After dinner, then, Stephen. After dinner.
6575319 6576987 During the brandies, gentlemen. Hmm?
6583285 6584995 [Lara] Cora, come get this girl.
6588499 6590375 -She a mess.<br />-Yes, ma'am.
6591043 6595422 Oh. Why are you all undone?<br />I just got you done up. Come on in here.
6602262 6606183 Baby, you on Stephen bad side,<br />and you need to be on his blind side.
6606266 6608018 You say you ain't know him.
6609645 6611605 -[Broomhilda] Huh?<br />-I said...
6612564 6615567 you said you ain't know him.
6617486 6618490 [Broomhilda] I don't.
6619446 6620489 Yes, you do.
6623075 6624118 Mr. Stephen...
6625559 6626578 I don't.
6627037 6628789 Why is you lying to me?
6631708 6632748 I ain't.
6633418 6634586 Then why is you crying?
6636255 6637464 You scaring me.
6638090 6639466 Why is I'm scaring you?
6640175 6641635 Because you scary.
6643846 6649184 [Schultz] <i>To speak German this afternoon</i><br /><i>with Hildi was positively soul-enriching.</i>
6649643 6652729 [Candie chuckles] Doctor, that warms<br />my heart to hear that.
6653313 6655691 You stay right here.
6661613 6666118 [Schultz] You indicated earlier<br />you'd be willing to part with Hildi.
6666368 6668662 Why, yes. Yessirree Bob, I did.
6671039 6672291 In that case,
6673041 6676670 allow me to propose another proposition.
6677171 6678255 I'm all ears.
6678505 6679923 Hurry up, goddamn it!
6681133 6682509 -Monsieur Candie--<br />-[Candie] Stephen.
6682593 6685679 [bangs table] You just<br />interrupted Dr. Schultz, here.
6687181 6689433 [Stephen] I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.
6689516 6692102 My ears ain't worth a damn, these days.
6692227 6693312 Excuse him.
6693562 6696273 Monsieur Candie, could I get<br />a word with you in the kitchen?
6697566 6699234 You mean get up out of my chair?
6699693 6701486 If'n you could manage it.
6701862 6705032 -Why?<br />-It's about dessert.
6705115 6706158 What about dessert?
6707034 6709620 I'd rather discuss that in private.
6709912 6711830 [chuckling] We're having white cake!
6712122 6714458 What sort of melodrama<br />could be brewing, back there?
6714750 6719087 You right, Monsieur Candie, you right.<br />I'll handle it myself. [chuckles]
6719254 6720672 [whispering] Meet me in the library.
6720839 6724218 [speaking] I just can't understand<br />why you won't come talk to these niggers.
6724301 6726220 Shit get fucked up around here,<br />you blame me.
6726303 6731016 Fine, fine. Friend Stephen,<br />I... will be along momentarily.
6731558 6732685 Yes, sir.
6733332 6734394 [Candie] Well...
6735520 6739316 Gentlemen, as you can see, talented<br />as they are, no doubt, in the kitchen,
6739399 6743028 from time to time,<br />adult supervision is required.
6743320 6744905 [all chuckling]
6745948 6747282 If you'll excuse me a moment.
6753914 6755582 You may clear the dinner service.
6757167 6760837 [Cora] <i>You heard him.</i><br /><i>Go on, get. Hurry up, girl.</i>
6760921 6762089 So, Dr. Schultz...
6763006 6765676 why don't you regale us<br />with a tale of the circus?
6766385 6768637 -The circus? [laughs]<br />-Yes.
6775394 6776645 What is the matter?
6782526 6787114 Them motherfuckers ain't here<br />to buy no Mandingos.
6787739 6789074 They wants that girl.
6789366 6790826 [chuckles]
6791535 6794288 Stephen, what the hell<br />are you talking about? Hmm?
6794413 6797332 They playing your ass for a fool,<br />is what I'm talking about.
6797958 6801378 They ain't here<br />for no muscle-bound Jimmie.
6802004 6803297 They here for that girl.
6803839 6806383 What... What girl? What, Hildi?
6806633 6810262 Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django?<br />Them niggers know each other.
6812097 6815058 -He just bought Eskimo Joe, I--<br />-Did he give you any money?
6815309 6817561 -No, not yet, but--<br />-Then he ain't bought diddly.
6817644 6820981 Not yet, no how.<br />But he's just about to buy...
6821481 6824026 who he come here to buy<br />when I interrupted him.
6824776 6827529 "Thank you, Stephen."<br />"You're welcome, Calvin."
6833160 6834870 Where you getting all this?
6836371 6839541 Why would they go through all that trouble<br />for a nigger with a chewed-up back
6839624 6840876 ain't worth 300 dollars?
6841335 6844755 They doing it 'cause that nigger Django's<br />in love with Hildi.
6845339 6846465 She probably his wife.
6847341 6850344 Now, why that German gives a fuck<br />who that uppity son of a bitch
6850427 6852971 is in love with, I'm sure I don't know.
6856183 6857434 If she's who they want...
6858477 6862606 why this whole snake oil pitch<br />about Mandingos, then?
6862981 6865984 You wouldn't pay no never mind<br />to no 300 dollar.
6866777 6868278 But that 12,000?
6869529 6871573 That made you real friendly,<br />now, didn't it?
6874701 6876078 Yes, it did.
6879915 6880955 His wife, huh?
6885629 6888799 If it had been a snake,<br />it would've bit me.
6889049 6890384 [chuckles]
6892552 6894012 Those lying...
6895347 6900977 goddamn time-wasting sons of bitches.
6902646 6904481 [claps] Sons of bitches!
6905023 6907901 [Lara] ...out of New Orleans,<br />so I have quite a bit of practice
6908026 6910570 with theater types. [chuckles]
6911321 6914616 Oh, there you are! I was beginning<br />to think that you and that old crow
6914699 6917744 -run off together.<br />-[all chuckling]
6917828 6919538 That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?
6920288 6923041 Lara Lee, I was just looking<br />out the big window.
6923250 6926253 Billy Crash is out there<br />dealing with some shady slaver
6926336 6927754 trying to sell a passel of ponies.
6927838 6930757 Would you be a dear, go out there<br />and give them gals an eyeball?
6931174 6932551 -Hmm?<br />-Of course, brother.
6932684 6933987 -Thank you, darling.<br />-[giggles]
6947149 6950485 -Yeah. Business never sleeps.<br />-Mm-hmm.
6952904 6957409 Apropos, before your exit,<br />we were discussing
6957492 6960078 the possibility<br />of my purchasing Broomhilda.
6960162 6962747 Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.
6963165 6965292 And we will again, in a moment.
6981766 6983226 Who's your little friend?
6986271 6987272 [clears throat]
6988940 6989983 This is Ben.
6991735 6995906 He's a old Joe that lived around here<br />for a long time.
6996781 6998533 And I do mean a long damn time.
7000494 7003747 Old Ben here took care of my daddy...
7004998 7006374 and my daddy's daddy.
7007334 7009294 Till he up and keeled over, one day...
7012714 7013924 Old Ben took care of me.
7016760 7020805 Growing up the son<br />of a huge plantation owner in Mississippi
7020889 7026394 puts a white man in contact<br />with a whole lot of black faces.
7028605 7033235 I spent my whole life here,<br />right here in Candyland...
7034945 7038281 surrounded by black faces.
7040825 7043537 Now, seeing them every day,<br />day in, day out, I...
7044412 7045956 I only had one question.
7050168 7053213 -Why don't they kill us?<br />-[laughs]
7055757 7057676 Now, right out there on that porch,
7058301 7060428 three times a week for 50 years,
7060971 7065016 Old Ben here would shave my daddy<br />with a straight razor.
7066268 7071231 Now, if I was Old Ben, I would've<br />cut my daddy's goddamn throat
7071398 7074442 and it wouldn't have taken me<br />no 50 years to do it, neither.
7077487 7078488 But he never did.
7080657 7081691 Why not?
7083410 7086913 You see, the science of phrenology...
7088290 7090000 is crucial to understanding
7090625 7093211 the separation of our two species.
7095130 7097340 In the skull of the African, here...
7099134 7101428 the area associated with submissiveness
7101636 7106683 is larger than any human or any other<br />subhuman species on planet Earth.
7107934 7109728 [sawing]
7113857 7115775 [sawing]
7122616 7123783 [Candie] If you examine...
7125744 7127537 this piece of skull, here...
7132709 7133856 [blowing]
7134252 7137672 [Candie] ...you will notice<br />three distinct dimples.
7141301 7144596 Here, here and here.
7145388 7151269 Now, if I was holding the skull<br />of an... Isaac Newton or Galileo,
7151811 7154439 these three dimples would be found<br />in the area of the skull
7154522 7157317 most associated with creativity.
7158443 7159819 But this is the skull of Old Ben.
7161071 7162572 And in the skull of Old Ben,
7163073 7164991 unburdened by genius,
7165784 7169788 these three dimples exist in the area<br />of the skull most associated with...
7171039 7172153 servility.
7173541 7174542 Now, Bright Boy.
7175877 7177921 I will admit you are pretty clever.
7180799 7182592 But if I took this hammer here...
7184844 7186971 and I bashed in your skull with it...
7188306 7190475 you would have the same three dimples...
7191476 7193061 in the same place...
7194562 7196189 -[wand chimes]<br />-[Candie] ...as Old Ben.
7197399 7198608 [roaring] Hey!
7198733 7200860 Now, lay your palms flat on that tabletop!
7201236 7204072 If you lift those palms<br />off that turtle shell tabletop,
7204155 7206658 Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose<br />with both barrels of that sawed-off.
7208618 7211955 There have been a lot of lies<br />said around this dinner table tonight,
7212038 7213707 but that, you can believe!
7214749 7217711 Mr. Moguy, would you be so kind<br />as to collect the pistols
7217794 7219337 hanging off these boys' hips, here?
7224551 7226845 -Thank you ever so much.<br />-[Leo] Doctor.
7231558 7232559 Where were we?
7237522 7238548 Jackass!
7242694 7243695 Ah, yes!
7244362 7246740 I do believe you were just getting ready
7246823 7249117 to make me a proposition<br />to buy Broomhilda.
7249909 7250911 Am I right?
7255415 7256466 Right.
7258960 7260128 Bring out Hildi!
7263423 7264758 [Stephen] Get over there yonder.
7266092 7268595 -Sit your ass in that goddamn chair!<br />-[screams]
7268678 7270388 [Stephen] Lay your hands flat<br />on that tabletop.
7270472 7271639 [Candie] Now, shut your mouth!
7275643 7276853 Dr. Schultz,
7277395 7281441 in Greenville, you yourself said<br />that for the right nigger,
7281524 7285653 you'd be willing to pay what some<br />may consider is a ridiculous amount.
7286196 7289407 To which me myself said,<br />"What is your definition of ridiculous?"
7289491 7292994 To which you said, "12,000 dollars."
7294162 7297707 Now, considering y'all have ridden<br />a whole lot of miles,
7297999 7302170 went through a whole lot of trouble<br />and done spread a whole lot of bull
7302295 7304631 to purchase this lovely lady right here,
7304714 7307967 it would appear<br />that Broomhilda is, in fact,
7308301 7310053 the right nigger.
7311137 7313765 And if y'all wanna leave<br />Candyland with Broomhilda...
7315099 7320522 the price is 12,000 dollars.
7320730 7324400 And I take it you prefer the "take it<br />or leave it" style of negotiation?
7326736 7328071 Yes, I do, doctor.
7329072 7331449 You see, under the laws<br />of Chickasaw County,
7332283 7334994 Broomhilda here is my property.
7335870 7340917 And I can choose to do<br />with my property whatever I so desire.
7342252 7344212 And if y'all think my price...
7345171 7348758 -for this nigger, here, is too steep...<br />-[yelps]
7348925 7351177 ...what I'm gonna desire to do is...
7355265 7358643 take this goddamn hammer here<br />and beat her ass to death with it!
7358810 7361145 -Right in front of both y'all!<br />-Easy, big fella.
7361229 7365400 Then, we can examine the three dimples<br />inside Broomhilda's skull!
7365859 7369487 Now, what's it gonna be, doc? Huh?
7370113 7371614 -[Broomhilda sobs]<br />-What's it gonna be?
7371698 7374909 May I lift the hands off the tabletop<br />in order to remove my billfold?
7376786 7377875 Yes, you may.
7382458 7383543 [Broomhilda sobs]
7391885 7392933 That 12.
7396973 7398933 -Sold!<br />-[screams]
7399183 7401603 [Candie] To the man<br />with the exceptional beard
7402061 7404689 and his unexceptional nigger.
7410945 7412780 -Mr. Moguy.<br />-Yes, Calvin?
7413907 7417076 Will you make these gentlemen a receipt<br />for 12,000 dollars, please?
7417285 7418870 Twelve thousand dollars.
7422206 7424250 It was a pleasure<br />doing business with y'all.
7425168 7426196 Now, gentlemen...
7428129 7429756 if you care to join me in the parlor...
7430965 7432842 we will be serving white cake.
7434218 7437138 ["Für Elise" by Ludwig van Beethoven<br />playing on harp]
7509210 7510586 [D'Artagnan screaming]
7521597 7523558 Well done, Calvin. [chuckles]
7525643 7526652 Excuse me.
7527145 7528187 Excuse me, ma'am?
7529605 7531607 Could you please stop playing Beethoven?
7532358 7534027 Take your hands off the harp.
7537655 7538740 [Stephen] Doctor.
7539574 7542076 -Doctor, you can't go in there.<br />-Stephen, Stephen--
7542160 7544370 -He ain't got no business going in there.<br />-Let it be.
7544787 7547790 He's just a little upset,<br />that's all. I'll handle this.
7574192 7575265 White cake?
7576194 7578446 [Schultz] I don't go in<br />for sweets. Thank you.
7579906 7580968 Hmm.
7585551 7586579 [Candie chuckles]
7588581 7590875 You brooding about me<br />getting the best of you, huh?
7592126 7596547 [Schultz] Actually, I was thinking of that<br />poor devil you fed to the dogs today.
7597006 7598091 D'Artagnan.
7599634 7602303 And I was wondering what Dumas<br />would make of all this.
7603554 7604604 Come again?
7608226 7611687 Alexandre Dumas.<br />He wrote <i>The Three Musketeers.</i>
7612355 7613981 [Candie] Yes, of course, doctor.
7614148 7615900 I figured you must be an admirer.
7615983 7619445 You named your slave<br />after his novel's lead character.
7620571 7624117 Now, if Alexandre Dumas<br />had been there today,
7624200 7625993 I wonder what he would've made of it.
7628538 7629914 You doubt he'd approve, huh?
7632291 7637130 Yes. His approval would be a dubious<br />proposition at best.
7637630 7638696 [chuckles]
7639799 7641092 Soft-hearted Frenchie.
7643594 7645304 Alexandre Dumas is black.
7649642 7652478 -Are these Broomhilda's papers?<br />-[Candie] Yes, they are.
7652728 7654188 -May I?<br />-[Candie] Of course.
7654355 7655419 Thank you.
7658025 7660903 That is her bill of sale,<br />her ownership history,
7660987 7663156 and of course, her freedom papers, doctor.
7663406 7665449 Would you have ink and pen for me?
7666868 7669453 -Right over there on that little table.<br />-[Schultz] Thank you.
7691140 7692165 Thank you.
7695980 7697607 Broomhilda Von Shaft.
7700359 7702236 Consider yourself a free woman.
7714707 7716209 Mr. Candie.
7718586 7722048 Normally, I would say <i>auf Wiedersehen.</i>
7722632 7726802 But since what <i>auf Wiedersehen</i><br />actually means is "till I see you again,"
7727553 7730556 and since I never wish<br />to see you again, to you, sir...
7731390 7733851 I say goodbye.
7738231 7739296 Let's go.
7740733 7741767 Come on.
7743986 7745696 [Candie] One more moment, doctor.
7747621 7748658 What?
7753537 7755331 It's a custom here, in the South...
7756290 7759168 once a business deal is concluded,<br />that the two parties...
7760002 7761087 shake hands.
7762505 7765508 -It implies good faith.<br />-I'm not from the South.
7765590 7766634 But you are...
7767760 7769345 in my house, doctor.
7770888 7772556 So I'm afraid I must insist.
7772765 7773793 Insist?
7774058 7776143 On what? That I shake your hand?
7776227 7779272 Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist<br />in the opposite direction.
7780106 7783192 -You know what I think you are?<br />-What you think I am?
7783276 7784527 No, I don't.
7786487 7788447 I think you are a bad loser.
7789073 7791659 And I think you're an abysmal winner.
7792285 7793341 [Candie] Nevertheless...
7794161 7796872 here in Chickasaw County,<br />a deal ain't done
7797415 7799667 until the two parties have shook hands.
7800584 7803254 Even after all that paper signing,<br />don't mean shit...
7804588 7807675 you don't shake my hand.
7808926 7814181 If I don't shake your hand,<br />you're gonna throw away 12,000 dollars?
7814890 7815933 I don't think so.
7817566 7818644 Mr. Pooch?
7820730 7824483 If she tries to leave here before this<br />nigger-loving German shakes my hand...
7825609 7826777 you cut her ass down.
7830031 7831188 [cocks gun]
7849258 7852136 You really want me to shake your hand?
7854096 7855556 I insist.
7857016 7858893 If you insist!
7876035 7878954 [screaming] No! Calvin!
7880498 7881874 Calvin!
7888089 7890424 I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

8364147 8366775 She gonna give him to the LeQuint Dickey<br />people.
8367025 8368026 [Django whimpers]
8368861 8370863 Well, she didn't waste<br />a minute telling me.
8378161 8379580 How disappointing.
8386378 8387713 [knife sizzles]
8388338 8390549 -[laughs]<br />-[horse neighing]
8402895 8404027 [Stephen] You leaving.
8406106 8408609 This, here, what you take with you.
8412362 8416074 Your black ass has been all them<br />motherfuckers at the Big House
8416158 8418785 could talk about for the last few hours.
8419578 8423415 Seem like white folk ain't never had<br />a bright idea in they life
8423498 8426043 was coming up with all kinds of ways<br />to kill your ass.
8426251 8431089 Now, mind you, most of them ideas had<br />to do with fucking with your fun parts.
8431798 8435260 Now, that may seem like a good idea,
8435636 8436887 but truth is...
8438847 8441350 when you snip a nigger's nuts,
8441433 8445812 most of them bleed out in,<br />oh, about, hmm, seven minutes.
8445896 8446919 Most of them.
8447211 8448273 [chuckles]
8448482 8450359 Oh. More than most.
8451401 8452486 Then I says...
8454404 8455989 "Shitfire!
8457366 8461078 The niggers we sells to LeQuint Dickey<br />got it worse than that."
8462454 8465207 And they still saying,<br />"Let's whip him to death,"
8465290 8468460 or, "Throw him to the Mandingos,"<br />"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."
8468794 8471838 And I said, "What's so special about that?
8472255 8475384 We do that shit<br />all the time. Hell's bells,
8475509 8480263 the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey<br />got it worse than that."
8481640 8483725 Lo and behold,
8484434 8488313 out of nowhere, Miss Lara<br />come up with the bright idea...
8489272 8492567 of giving your ass<br />to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
8495445 8499324 And as a slave<br />of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company...
8500492 8503453 henceforth, till the day you die...
8504287 8506790 all day, every day...
8507541 8509751 you will be swinging a sledgehammer...
8510502 8514172 turning big rocks into little rocks.
8515590 8519094 Now, when you get there,<br />they gonna take away your name...
8520053 8522597 give you a number and a sledgehammer...
8523306 8524933 and say, "Get to work."
8525892 8528353 And one word of sass,<br />they cuts out your tongue.
8528437 8530439 And they good at it, too.<br />You won't bleed out.
8530856 8533525 Oh, they does that real good.
8534401 8535736 They gonna work you,
8536319 8540657 all day, every day,<br />till your back give out.
8541616 8543994 Then they're gonna hit you<br />in the head with a hammer,
8544244 8545996 throw your ass down the nigger-hole.
8546913 8551960 And that will be the story of you, Django.

8619236 8620862 What the fuck you talking about?
8621530 8626243 Back there at that plantation, Candyland,<br />there was an 11,500-dollar fortune.
8626368 8628745 Just sitting there.<br />And y'all rode right past it.
8629663 8631540 You be damned, blackie.<br />We're not bandits.
8631623 8632624 I ain't saying that.

8636294 8639089 You can't steal it.<br />You got to earn it, white boy.
8640382 8642175 You got something to say, mate,<br />you say it.
8642467 8645887 The 11,500-dollar fortune<br />waiting for you back at Candyland
8645971 8648390 is in the form<br />of a "wanted, dead or alive" bounty
8648473 8650475 on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.
8650684 8652435 Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?
8652519 8654855 Smitty Bacall is the leader<br />of this murderous gang
8654938 8656982 of stagecoach robbers,<br />the Bacall Gang.
8657691 8660610 There's a 7,000-dollar<br />"wanted, dead or alive" bounty on him,
8660986 8664322 1,500 dollars for each<br />of his three accomplices,
8664528 8665574 Dandy Michaels,
8666408 8669786 Gerald Nash and Crazy Craig Koons.
8670871 8673623 All four of them gentlemen,<br />they back there at Candyland
8673707 8675458 laughing their ass off. You know why?
8676126 8677711 Because they just got away with murder.
8678545 8681047 But it ain't got to be that way.<br />You and your mates?
8681298 8683550 Y'all can ride back there<br />and y'all can get that money.
8683675 8684885 What'd these jokers do, again?
8685010 8687637 These sons of bitches,<br />they killed innocent people.
8688555 8690891 Stagecoach robbery. Innocent white people.
8693059 8695896 I got the handbill right here<br />in my pocket, if you let me get it.
8696104 8697109 Get it out.
8699149 8702360 [Roy] "Wanted, dead or alive.<br />Smitty Bacall
8702444 8705155 -and the Smitty Bacall Gang."<br />-[Frank] But you're a slave.
8705238 8708617 -[Django] I ain't no goddam slave!<br />-[Roy] "Murder and stagecoach robbery."
8708700 8710035 Do I sound like a fucking slave?
8710118 8712829 -[Roy] "7,000 dollars for Smitty Bacall."<br />-[Frank] That's a shitload.
8712913 8713983 I'm a bounty hunter.
8715957 8718126 Yesterday, as a free man,
8718877 8723131 I rode into Candyland on a horse<br />with my German, white partner,
8723590 8724674 Dr. King Schultz.
8725258 8728094 We tracked the Bacall Gang<br />all the way from Texas
8728386 8729721 to Chickasaw County.
8730263 8732849 We finally found their ass<br />laying low in Candyland.
8733225 8735977 We went in there to get them,<br />things went sour...
8736937 8739814 my partner got killed,<br />Calvin Candie got shot,
8740440 8743944 then everybody there decided to blame me,<br />so here I am.
8746613 8748240 But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.
8748698 8751034 And all y'all know I ain't<br />supposed to be on this trip.
8751743 8754537 But them four men is still back there,<br />they're still wanted,
8755121 8757874 and that 11,500 is up for grabs,<br />and the last thing
8757958 8760293 they'd expect is y'all<br />riding back in there and getting it.
8761002 8762087 [Roy] Well, what's the deal?
8763046 8766633 You tell us who they are<br />and we turn you loose?
8766716 8768760 No, no, no. I ain't gonna<br />tell you who they are.
8769552 8772764 But you give me a pistol,<br />one of them horses,
8773181 8777560 and 500 dollars of that 11,500?<br />And I'll point them out to you.
8777978 8779354 [Roy] <i>This is a real handbill.</i>
8779896 8783191 Just because it's a real handbill, doesn't<br />mean that other bunch of malarkey is.
8783400 8785694 Now, why would a slave
8785777 8789364 have a "wanted, dead or alive" handbill<br />in his pocket?
8794077 8796705 Did that black ride into Candyland<br />yesterday?
8803169 8806798 -All right, I'm gonna ask you again.<br />-[cocks gun]
8808508 8810635 I want you to remember,<br />I don't like liars.
8811678 8813471 Is he a Candyland slave,
8813555 8817142 or did he ride in with a white man<br />on a horse, yesterday?
8817268 8818293 Yeah.
8819602 8821688 They walked us<br />from the Greenville auction
8821771 8823732 and he rode in on a horse<br />with a white man.
8824858 8828570 Now, this white man...<br />Was the black his slave?
8829195 8830405 He wasn't no slave.
8830947 8832615 You fucking sure about that?
8832949 8833992 Damn sure.
8836077 8837120 Uh-huh.
8838663 8840373 What happened over in Candyland?
8840498 8843043 Bunch of shooting. Master got shot.
8844210 8845837 -Who shot him?<br />-The German.
8846463 8847550 Why'd he do that?
8848173 8851009 Nigger and the German was acting like<br />they were slavers, but they wasn't.
8852052 8854637 -[Roy] Well, what were they?<br />-Bounty hunters.
8856014 8858808 Fuck me, Roy. I mean,<br />this could be big, mate!

8894636 8896721 There we go. There you go, mate.
8896805 8897832 Yeah.
8898431 8900600 [Roy] We're gonna give you<br />that packhorse over there.
8901184 8903895 -What the saddlebags got in them?<br />-[Floyd] Dynamite.
8904479 8906940 I ain't riding no horse<br />with no goddamn dynamite on its back.

8912153 8913947 and stick them in the nigger-cage?
8916032 8920328 A little dynamite for you black fellas<br />to play with! [laughs]
8929712 8932590 Here, Floyd, you got that rifle<br />up on the wagon, don't you?
