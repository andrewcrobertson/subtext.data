211212 212963 [man grunting]
218260 220137 [horse nickering]
234318 236862 - Whoa.<br />- [horses snorting]
237029 239698 [gentle metallic rattling]
243160 244328 Whoa.
258759 261971 Who's that stumblin'<br />around in the dark?
262138 265933 State your business<br />or prepare to get winged!
266100 268686 Calm yourselves, gentlemen.
268853 271188 I mean you no harm.
271355 276193 I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.<br />Whoa, boy.
277528 279196 Good cold evening, gentlemen.
279363 281699 I'm looking for a pair of slave traders
281866 283534 that go by the name<br />of the Speck Brothers.
283701 285536 Might that be you?
286912 289665 - Who wants to know?<br />- Well, I do.
289832 291709 I'm Dr. King Schultz.<br />This is my horse, Fritz.
291876 292793 [snorting]
292960 296464 - What kinda doctor?<br />- [Schultz] Dentist.
296630 298424 Now, are you the Speck Brothers?
298591 301385 And did you purchase those men<br />at the Greenville slave auction?
301552 304138 - So what?<br />- So I wish to parley with you.
304305 307641 - Speak English.<br />- [chuckles] Oh, I'm sorry.
307808 310019 Please forgive me.<br />It is a second language.
310186 313481 Now, amongst your inventory,<br />I've been led to believe,
313647 316066 is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.
316233 317693 Hello, you poor devils!
319028 321614 Is there one amongst you<br />who was formerly a resident
321780 325075 of the Carrucan plantation?
325826 328037 [man] I'm from the Carrucan plantation.
329663 331040 Who said that?
338589 339840 [Schultz lighting match]
378254 379630 What's your name?
383801 385678 Django.
385844 388597 Then you are exactly<br />the one I'm looking for.
390474 392685 Do you know who<br />the Brittle Brothers are?
396313 397314 Who are they?
399733 401360 Big John.
402152 403487 Ellis.
404905 408826 Roger.<br />Sometime they call him Lil Raj.
410202 412413 They was overseers<br />at the Carrucan plantation.
412580 413664 Not anymore.
416750 417793 Tell me...
418377 421171 ...if you were to see<br />any of these three gentlemen again,
421338 424008 - would you recognize them?<br />- [man] Hey.
424174 426635 - Stop talkin' to him like that.<br />- Like what?
426802 428345 Like that.
428512 430806 My good man,<br />I'm simply trying to ascertain...
430973 433017 Speak English, goddamn it.
433183 434935 Everybody calm down.
435102 438814 I'm simply a customer<br />trying to conduct a transaction.
438981 441984 I don't care. No sale.<br />Now, off with ya.
442151 445154 [scoffs] Don't be ridiculous.<br />Of course they're for sale.
445988 447448 Move it.
447615 452536 My good man, did you simply get carried<br />away with your dramatic gesture
452703 456498 or are you pointing your weapon at me<br />with lethal intention?
457583 459460 Last chance, fancy pants.
460878 463213 Oh, very well.
463881 464923 [horse whinnying]
466508 468844 [man screaming]
472973 474642 [scream echoing]
487529 490240 [screaming continues]
491992 494411 I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,
494578 496497 but I didn't want you<br />to do anything rash
496664 498957 before you had a moment<br />to come to your senses.
499124 502544 You goddamn son of a bitch!
502711 505506 - You shot Roscoe!<br />- Well...
505673 507383 And you killed Ace!
507549 510219 I only shot your brother once<br />he threatened to shoot me.
510386 513222 And I do believe I have...<br />one, two, three, four...
513389 516350 ...five witnesses<br />who can attest to that fact.
516517 519395 - Damn leg's busted!<br />- No doubt.
519561 522106 Now, if you could keep your<br />caterwauling down to a minimum,
522272 525609 I'd like to finish my line<br />of inquiry with young Django.
525776 527778 [screaming resumes]
529613 533075 - [man] God-fuckin'-damn it!<br />- As I was saying...
533242 536954 ...if you were to see the Brittle<br />Brothers again, you could recognize 'em?
537621 539331 Yeah.
539498 540791 Sold American!
540958 544920 So, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck?<br />How much for young Django here?
550217 552845 That iron is nasty business.
558058 560185 Oh, could you hold this for a moment?
562312 563814 Thank you. Django?
563981 565858 Get up on that horse.
566024 567818 Also, if I were you,
567985 571989 I'd take that winter coat<br />the dear departed Speck left behind.
586128 590007 Nigger!<br />Don't you touch my brother's coat.
598974 600517 [screaming]
600684 605606 Goddamn it! Oh!<br />[moaning]
607274 612446 One hundred... ten... 20...
612613 614448 ...and five...
615699 616867 ...for young Django here.
617034 619203 And since he won't<br />be needing it anymore,
619369 621872 I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.
622581 627544 Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid<br />I will require a bill of sale.
627711 629296 Do you have one?
629463 632382 - You go to hell, dentist.<br />- [scoffs]
632549 634551 I thought not.
634718 638222 No worries. I come prepared.
642559 644144 Thank you.
644311 647898 This will serve nicely<br />as a bill of sale.
652820 654404 [nickering]
660244 661245 Whoa.
665415 668877 Now, as to you poor devils.
669044 674091 So, as I see it, when it comes to<br />the subject of what to do next,
674258 677094 you gentlemen have two choices.
677261 682391 One: Once I'm gone, you could lift<br />that beast off the remaining Speck,
682558 684476 then carry him to the nearest town.
684643 688230 Which would be at least<br />37 miles back the way you came.
688397 694069 Or two: You could unshackle yourselves,<br />take that rifle,
694236 696780 put a bullet in his head,<br />bury the two of them deep,
696947 700492 and then make your way to a<br />more enlightened area of this country.
701577 702744 Choice is yours.
702911 707291 Oh, and on the off chance there are<br />any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
707457 710460 the North Star is that one.
711920 715090 Ta-ta. [clucking]
729897 733984 Now wait a minute, fellas.<br />Let's talk about this!
734234 737446 - [lantern crashing]<br />- [chains rattling]
737613 741033 You gotta be reasonable<br />in a situation like this!
742492 745495 I'm not a bad guy.<br />I'm just doin' my job!
745662 749249 Blueberry, didn't I<br />give you my last apple?
749416 752377 Tell you what, boys:<br />Take me to the doc in El Paso,
752544 754588 - I'll get you your freedom.<br />- [gun cocking]
754755 758508 - No. No, please...<br />- [gunshot echoing]
774232 776068 [dogs barking nearby]
800884 803178 [squeaking]
803845 805222 All right, now.
805389 807391 I'd like you to<br />take two of these tonight...
807557 809768 - [coughing]<br />- ...and then in the morning...
811895 813689 That's a nigger on a horse.
839297 841091 What's everybody staring at?
841258 843760 They ain't never seen<br />no nigger on a horse before.
844970 847222 [goats bleating]
856064 857065 Whoa.
867117 869119 Good morning, innkeeper!
870454 872914 Two beers for two weary travelers.
873081 874833 It's still a bit early.
875000 877419 We won't be open for another hour.
877586 879421 By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.
879588 885010 [gasping] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what<br />the hell you think you're doing, boy?
885177 887262 Get that nigger outta here!
890807 894811 - [panting] Help! Help!<br />- Innkeeper!
894978 898148 Remember, get the sheriff,<br />not the marshal.
898315 900192 [man] Sheriff! Help!
900358 901985 Alas.
903361 905906 Now we must act as our own bartender.
908325 910077 Sit down, my boy.
919753 922631 - What kind of dentist are you?<br />- [chortles]
923465 928053 Despite that cart, I haven't<br />practiced dentistry in five years.
932682 935977 But these days,<br />I practice a new profession...
938188 939564 ...bounty hunter.
946154 947989 Do you know what a bounty hunter is?
948698 949741 No.
949908 951118 Well...
952744 956873 ...the way the slave trade<br />deals in human lives for cash,
957040 959376 a bounty hunter deals in corpses.
959543 961753 [tsking] Hat.
965507 967050 Prost.
975225 977894 The state places a bounty<br />on a man's head.
978061 980730 I track that man, I find that man,<br />I kill that man.
980897 984860 After I've killed him, I transport that<br />man's corpse back to the authorities.
985026 987737 Sometimes that's easier said than done.
987904 990699 I show that corpse to the authorities,<br />proving yes, indeed,
990866 992576 I truly have killed him,
992742 995745 at which point the authorities<br />pay me the bounty.
995912 999249 So, like slavery,<br />it's a flesh for cash business.
1000876 1001877 What's a bounty?
1005672 1007132 It's like a reward.
1007299 1010677 You kill people?<br />And they give you a reward?
1010844 1012721 Certain people, yeah.
1012888 1014014 Bad people?
1014181 1018143 Ah! Badder they are,<br />bigger the reward.
1018310 1020604 Which brings me to you.
1020770 1025025 And I must admit, I'm at a bit of<br />a quandary when it comes to you.
1025192 1027611 On one hand, I despise slavery.
1027777 1030906 On the other hand, I need your help.
1031072 1034451 If you're not in a position to refuse,<br />all the better.
1035327 1037996 So, for the time being, I'm gonna<br />make this slavery malarkey
1038163 1040373 work to my benefit.
1040540 1045212 Still, having said that, I feel guilty.
1046880 1052135 So, I would like the two of us<br />to enter into an agreement.
1059184 1061019 I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.
1065690 1067025 However, at this endeavor,
1067192 1072322 I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar<br />as I don't know what they look like.
1073573 1076451 But you do. Don't ya?
1076618 1078828 I know what they look like all right.
1078995 1082499 Good. So here's my agreement.
1082666 1086086 - You travel with me until we find them.<br />- Where we goin'?
1086253 1088880 I hear at least two of them<br />are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,
1089047 1091216 but I don't know where.
1091383 1095679 That means we visit every plantation<br />in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.
1095845 1101101 And when we find them,<br />you point them out, and I kill them.
1102143 1105522 You do that, I agree<br />to give you your freedom,
1105689 1109818 $25 per Brittle Brother. That's $75.
1109985 1113697 And, as if on cue,<br />here comes the sheriff.
1117534 1118785 [scoffs]
1121454 1126960 OK, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.
1129587 1134175 - [overlapping chatter]<br />- All right, folks, calm down.
1135218 1136928 Go about your business.
1137721 1140098 These jokers will be gone soon.
1142058 1147480 Now, why y'all wanna come<br />into my town and start trouble?
1147647 1150900 And scare all these nice people.
1152068 1154738 You ain't got nothing better to do
1154904 1158116 than to come into Bill Sharp's town
1158283 1160535 and show your ass?
1160702 1162454 - [metal springing noise]<br />- [sheriff screaming]
1162620 1165582 - [crowd gasping]<br />- [groaning]
1165749 1167125 [woman screams]
1168877 1172797 - What'd you just do to our sheriff?<br />- [groaning]
1174257 1176134 - [yelling]<br />- [shot echoing]
1176301 1177510 [woman gasps]
1177677 1179637 [crowd screaming]
1184100 1186436 Now you can get the marshal.
1187937 1190273 [man] Marshal! Marshal!
1190440 1192692 - Should we wait inside?<br />- Can we just leave?
1192859 1194069 After you.
1196529 1200742 Move that buckboard a long ways<br />across the street from the saloon.
1200909 1203787 I want six men, six rifles behind it.
1203953 1206122 I want two men,<br />two rifles up on this roof.
1206289 1208625 Two men, two rifles on that roof.
1208792 1211753 All the barrels aimed<br />at that front door.
1211920 1214923 Somebody get poor Bill<br />outta the goddamn street.
1216091 1218259 You in the saloon!
1218426 1221763 We got a hundred rifles aimed<br />at every way out of that buildin'.
1222472 1225642 You got one chance<br />to get out of this alive.
1226476 1228978 You and your nigger come out right now<br />with your hands over your head,
1229145 1231106 and I mean right now.
1232232 1235652 [Schultz] Is this the marshal<br />I have the pleasure of addressing?
1235819 1237612 Yes, it is.
1237779 1239864 This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.
1240031 1242325 [Schultz]<br /><i>Na wunderbar,</i> marshal.
1242826 1246413 I have relieved myself of all weapons,
1246579 1249499 and just as you have instructed,
1249666 1252335 I am ready to step outside
1252502 1256589 with my hands raised above my head.
1257674 1260093 I trust as a representative
1260260 1263638 of the criminal justice system of<br />the United States of America,
1263805 1269644 I shan't be shot down in the street<br />by either you or your deputies
1269811 1272647 before I've had my day in court.
1272814 1275150 You mean like you did our sheriff.
1275316 1277110 Shot him down like a dog in the street.
1277277 1279612 Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
1279779 1285452 Do I have your word as a lawman not to<br />shoot me down like a dog in the street?
1288788 1292041 Well, much as we'd all enjoy<br />seeing something like that,
1292208 1295211 ain't nobody gonna cheat<br />the hangman in my town.
1296254 1299215 Fair enough, marshal.<br />Here we come.
1301050 1303219 They're a little tense out there.
1303386 1306848 So don't make any quick movements,<br />and let me do the talking.
1307182 1309851 - [doors squeaking open]<br />- Come ahead.
1316900 1318151 You unarmed?
1318318 1320028 [Schultz] Yes, indeed we are.
1320778 1324115 Marshal Tatum, may I address you<br />and your deputies,
1324282 1326242 and apparently the<br />entire town of Daughtrey,
1326409 1328745 as to the incident that just occurred?
1330079 1332540 - Go on.<br />- Thank you.
1332707 1334834 My name is Dr. King Schultz.
1335001 1338254 Like yourself, marshal,<br />I'm a servant of the court.
1338421 1341841 The man lying dead in the dirt,<br />who the good people of Daughtrey
1342008 1346095 saw fit to elect as their sheriff,<br />who went by the name of Bill Sharp,
1346262 1350850 is actually a wanted outlaw<br />by the name of Willard Peck,
1351017 1353603 with a price on his head of $200.
1353770 1356731 Now that's $200, dead or alive.
1356898 1358233 The hell, you say!
1358399 1362445 I'm aware this is probably<br />disconcerting news.
1362612 1365782 But I'm willing to wager<br />this man was elected sheriff
1365949 1368451 sometime in the past two years?
1369369 1370370 Yeah.
1370537 1373957 [Schultz] I know this because three<br />years ago, he was rustling cattle
1374123 1377585 from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company<br />of Lubbock, Texas.
1377752 1381548 Now, this is a warrant<br />made out by
1381714 1387387 Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen<br />Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.
1387554 1389264 You're encouraged to wire him.
1389430 1394477 He'll back up who I am and<br />who your dear departed sheriff was.
1394644 1398606 [guns uncocking]
1402652 1406573 In other words, marshal,<br />you owe me $200.
1406739 1409659 [medium-tempo song plays]
1415248 1416749 I'll be damned.
1444819 1448364 After this Brittle business<br />is behind us,
1448531 1454078 you'll be a free man, with a horse,<br />$75 in your back pocket...
1456873 1458291 What's your plan after that?
1460543 1464380 Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
1466633 1471512 Django, I had no idea<br />you were a married man.
1472013 1474307 Do most slaves believe in marriage?
1474474 1478061 Oh, me and my wife do.
1478227 1482398 Old Man Carrucan didn't.<br />That's why we, uh... we run off.
1483608 1485234 [man] Django.
1485902 1488488 Django, Django.
1488655 1491366 You got sand, Django.
1492075 1493951 Boy's got sand.
1495745 1498873 I got no use for a nigger with sand.
1500583 1504087 I want you to burn a runaway "r"<br />right here on his cheek.
1504253 1505296 And the girl, too.
1505463 1507256 [groaning]
1507423 1512220 And I want you to take 'em to<br />the Greenville auction and sell 'em.
1513054 1514931 Both of 'em.
1515098 1516849 Separately.
1519310 1520645 And this one...
1523272 1525983 ...you will sell him cheap.
1527944 1529445 In Greenville...
1531989 1534951 ...there should be some sort<br />of a records office.
1542166 1544377 You know when she was sold...
1545837 1548798 ...you know where she came from,
1548965 1550800 and you know her name.
1551592 1553136 What is her name?
1553302 1554971 Broomhilda.
1556556 1559809 - What?<br />- Broom-hilda.
1559976 1561936 - Broomhilda?<br />- Hm-mm.
1564021 1567024 - Were her owners German?<br />- Yeah, how you know?
1567900 1569318 She wasn't born on<br />the Carrucan plantation.
1569485 1572029 She was raised by a German mistress,<br />the Von Shafts.
1572196 1574323 She speak a little German, too.
1574490 1576242 - Your wife?<br />- Hm-mm.
1576409 1578244 When she was little, her mistress<br />taught her so she'd have somebody
1578411 1579996 to speak German with.
1581581 1584167 Well, let me get this straight.
1584333 1588921 Your slave wife speaks German<br />and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?
1589088 1590214 Yep.
1594260 1597013 They call me Hildi.
1605605 1607523 [rooster crowing nearby]
1613696 1619285 When we gain access to these<br />plantations, we'll be putting on an act.
1620620 1623372 You'll be playing a character.
1630254 1631380 Hm?
1632089 1633508 No?
1640515 1644977 During the act, you can<br />never break character.
1646062 1647605 Do you understand?
1648356 1650900 Yeah. Don't break character.
1653236 1657156 And your character<br />is that of The Valet.
1657907 1659408 What that is?
1660326 1662703 That's a fancy word for servant.
1662870 1664121 - Valet?<br />- Hm-mm.
1664288 1665456 [chuckles]
1665623 1670127 And now, Django, you may choose<br />your character's costume.
1672547 1674382 Youse gonna let me<br />pick out my own clothes?
1674549 1675508 But of course.
1675675 1679345 [medium-tempo song<br />resumes playing]
1704287 1705496 Whoa.
1709792 1713379 It's against the law for niggers<br />to ride horses in this territory.
1713546 1716924 This is my valet.<br />My valet does not walk.
1717091 1720970 - I said niggers on horses...<br />- [Schultz] His name is Django.
1721137 1723931 He's a free man.<br />He can ride what he pleases.
1724098 1727560 Not on my property.<br />Not around my niggers, he can't.
1728227 1733232 My good sir,<br />perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.
1733399 1735860 Allow me to unring this bell.
1736027 1739864 My name is Dr. King Schultz.<br />This is my valet, Django.
1740031 1742158 And these are our horses,<br />Tony and Fritz.
1742325 1744160 - [snorting]<br />- [women giggling]
1745995 1747371 Mr. Bennett?
1747538 1751751 I've been led to believe that you<br />are a gentleman and a businessman.
1751918 1755880 And it is for these attributes<br />we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee
1756047 1757965 to parley with you now.
1758799 1763095 I wish to purchase<br />one of your nigger gals.
1764639 1767725 You and your Jimmie<br />rode from Texas to Tennessee
1767892 1769685 to buy one of my nigger gals?
1769852 1771520 No appointment, no nothin'?
1771687 1773606 Oh, I'm afraid so.
1773773 1776192 Well, what if I was to say<br />I don't like you?
1776359 1778027 Or your fancy-pants nigger?
1778194 1780404 And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.
1780571 1782531 Now what you got to say about that?
1785868 1787787 Mr. Bennett.
1787954 1791207 If you are the businessman<br />I've been led to believe you to be,
1791374 1796545 I have 5,000 things I might say<br />that could change your mind.
1797964 1799006 [chuckles softly]
1800758 1804220 Well, come on inside and get<br />yourself somethin' cool to drink.
1806222 1807306 Hm-mm.
1810977 1812061 [chuckles]
1818734 1820695 Oh, maybe while we discuss business,
1820861 1823406 you could provide one of<br />your loveliest black creatures
1823572 1825950 to escort Django here<br />around your magnificent grounds.
1826117 1828285 Oh, well, absolutely!<br />Uh, Betina.
1828452 1830204 - Yessir, Big Daddy?<br />- Uh...
1830371 1832248 What's your Jimmie's name again?
1832415 1833916 - Django.<br />- Django.
1834083 1836252 Betina, sugar, could you<br />take Django there
1836419 1839630 and take him around the grounds here<br />and show him all the pretty stuff.
1839797 1841090 As you please, Big Daddy.
1841257 1845177 Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you,<br />Django is a free man.
1845344 1848681 He cannot be treated like a slave.<br />He... within the bounds of good taste,
1848848 1851350 he must be treated<br />as an extension of myself.
1851517 1854520 - Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?<br />- Yes'm?
1854687 1859316 Django isn't a slave.<br />Django is a free man, you understand?
1860651 1862820 You can't treat him like any<br />of the other niggers around here,
1862987 1865906 'cause he ain't like any of the<br />other niggers around here. You got it?
1866073 1868951 You want I should<br />treat him like white folks?
1869118 1872246 No. That's not what I said.
1872413 1874957 Then I don't know what you want,<br />Big Daddy.
1875458 1879962 Yes, I can see that. Uh...
1880129 1884592 What's the name of that peckerwood boy<br />from town that works with the glass?
1884759 1886719 His mama work over at the lumberyard.
1886886 1889638 - Oh, you mean Jerry.<br />- That's the boy's name. Jerry!
1889805 1891307 You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?
1891474 1894602 - Yes'm, Big Daddy.<br />- Well, that's it, then.
1894769 1897730 You just treat him like you would Jerry.
1897938 1901233 [playing medium-tempo tune]
1904695 1907406 That house we just left from<br />is The Big House.
1907573 1910493 Big Daddy call it that 'cause it's big.
1911660 1913829 That there is the pantry.
1913996 1917500 That's where Big Daddy<br />hang all his dead meat.
1917666 1919710 Po' little squirrels.
1921420 1923839 What you do for your massa?
1924006 1925758 Didn't you hear him tell you<br />I ain't no slave?
1925925 1928344 - So you really free?<br />- Yes, I's free.
1928511 1930846 You mean you wanna dress like that?
1932681 1935142 - Betina, I need to ask you somethin'.<br />- What you want?
1935309 1938395 I'm lookin' for three white men.<br />Three brothers. Overseers.
1938562 1940022 Their name is Brittle. You know 'em?
1940189 1942066 - Brittle?<br />- Yes, Brittle.
1942233 1946529 John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,<br />Roger Brittle, sometime called Lil Raj.
1946695 1948531 I don't know them.
1949115 1950950 They could be usin' a different name.
1951117 1953369 They woulda come to the plantation<br />this past year.
1953536 1956163 - You mean the Shaffers?<br />- Maybe.
1956330 1958457 - Three brothers?<br />- Uh-huh.
1958624 1960376 - They here?<br />- Uh-huh.
1960543 1962294 Could you point one of 'em out to me?
1962461 1964755 Well, one's over in that field.
1970719 1973556 [medium-tempo song plays]
1978853 1980437 [Django] Old Man Carrucan ain't<br />gonna appreciate this, now.

1983774 1985734 and she ain't gonna be worth...<br />she ain't gonna be worth a damn thing.
1985901 1987778 Now, your Bible say...
1992366 1994535 [Django] Look, I told you<br />that I was one that made her do it.
1994702 1996328 You ready?
1996495 1998789 She didn't wanna run off with me. If<br />anybody should be gettin' whupped now,
1998956 2000332 it should be me. It should be me, John.
2000499 2003460 Now, I been here long enough, you know<br />me, you know me a long time, now.
2003627 2006213 [dogs barking in distance]
2013220 2015181 You know Massa Carrucan<br />ain't gonna appreciate this.
2015347 2016974 She's a... she's a house slave.
2017141 2020561 - She a house slave, she can't be...<br />- [screaming]

2053844 2056347 [whip cracking, echoing]
2057640 2059975 Is that who you was lookin' for?

2094343 2097304 - [cracking]<br />- "...and the dread of ye
2097471 2099765 shall be on every beast<br />of the earth.'"
2099932 2100891 [cracking]
2101058 2102434 Come here now, woman!
2102601 2105688 - You'd better give me that arm!<br />- [screaming]
2122871 2124623 OK, she's ready!
2126709 2129003 [whimpering]
2138721 2142725 And after this, we'll see<br />if you break eggs again.
2146145 2148063 John Brittle!
2168625 2171295 - You remember me?<br />- [metal springing noise]
2182222 2184600 I like the way you die, boy.
2190356 2192900 Goddamn son of a bitch!
2201950 2203744 [grunting]
2204370 2205788 [whip cracking]
2206497 2207581 [groaning]
2210959 2212419 - Keep it funny!<br />- [grunting]
2216298 2218008 [yelling]
2227059 2228644 [man groaning]
2237986 2239446 Y'all wanna see somethin'?
2240239 2241698 [cocking pistol]
2242950 2244618 No! [groans]
2249123 2250541 [clicking]
2254753 2256296 Who were they?
2257005 2260008 That's Big John,<br />and that's Lil Raj.
2260175 2261677 Where's Ellis?
2261844 2264179 He's the one hightailin' it<br />across that field right now.
2269017 2270519 - You sure that's him?<br />- Yeah.
2270686 2272604 - Positive?<br />- I don't know.
2272771 2275023 - You don't know if you're positive?<br />- I don't know what "positive" mean.
2275190 2276442 - It means you're sure.<br />- Yes.
2276608 2278902 - "Yes," what?<br />- Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.
2292124 2293709 I'm positive he dead.
2298755 2299756 Django!
2301550 2303969 Everybody calm down.
2304136 2306388 We mean no one else any harm.
2306555 2308098 Who are you two jokers?
2308265 2311268 I am Dr. King Schultz,<br />a legal representative
2311435 2314104 of the criminal justice system of<br />the United States of America.
2314271 2318859 The man to my left is Django Freeman.<br />He's my deputy.
2319026 2320986 In my pocket is a warrant,
2321153 2325240 signed by Circuit Court Judge<br />Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,
2325407 2329286 for the arrest and capture,<br />dead or alive,
2329453 2334458 of John Brittle,<br />Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.
2334625 2336710 They were goin' by the name Shaffer.
2338128 2342257 You know them by the name of Shaffer,<br />but the butchers' real name was Brittle.
2342424 2344092 These are wanted men.
2344259 2345719 The law wants 'em for murder.
2345886 2350015 Now, I reiterate, the warrant<br />states dead or alive,
2350182 2353477 so when Mr. Freeman and myself<br />executed these men on sight,
2353644 2357105 we were operating<br />within our legal boundaries.
2358232 2362611 I realize passions are high,
2362778 2366823 but I must warn you,<br />the penalty for taking deadly force
2366990 2369368 against an officer of the court<br />in the performance of his duty
2369535 2373455 is you'll be hung by the neck<br />until you're dead.
2376333 2381213 Now, may I please remove the warrant<br />from my pocket so you may examine it?
2383298 2384424 Gimme.
2400983 2402317 Satisfied?
2408824 2411118 May I have that back, please?
2416832 2419835 - Get off my land.<br />- Posthaste.
2420502 2424923 Load up the bodies as quickly as you can<br />and let's get outta here.
2428010 2430470 [Schultz whistling indistinctly]
2450782 2454286 Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.
2462169 2465547 [galloping hoofbeats]
2467382 2471678 - [dramatic choral music]<br />- [horses snorting, whinnying]
2479519 2482564 [men yelling, whooping]
2494326 2495577 Come on, men!
2497788 2501291 - [man 1 ] We're coming for you, nigger!<br />- [man 2] Hee-haw!
2510509 2514930 Now, unless they start shootin' first,<br />nobody shoot 'em.
2515097 2517307 That's way too simple for these jokers.
2518058 2520686 We're gonna whup that<br />nigger-lover to death.
2520852 2525899 And I'm gonna personally<br />strip and clip that garboon myself.
2529778 2530987 Damn.
2532322 2534950 I can't see fuckin' shit<br />outta this thing.
2535867 2537160 We ready or what?
2537327 2539705 [Big Daddy] Aw, hold on,<br />I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.
2539871 2542249 - [fabric ripping]<br />- Oh... Oh, shit.
2542416 2544626 I just made it worse.
2544793 2546837 Who made this goddamn shit?
2547003 2549965 - Willard's wife.<br />- Well, make your own goddamn masks!
2550132 2553719 Look, nobody's sayin'<br />they don't appreciate what Jenny did.
2553885 2556471 Well, if all I had to do<br />was cut a hole in a bag,
2556638 2558306 I coulda cut it better than this!
2558473 2561268 What about you, Robert?<br />Can you see?
2561435 2562644 Not too good.
2562811 2567149 I mean, if I don't move my head I can<br />see you pretty good, more or less.
2567315 2570819 But when I start ridin', the bag's<br />movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.
2570986 2573071 - Shit.<br />- [man] Yeah.
2573613 2575282 I just made mine worse.
2576116 2577242 Oh, God.
2577409 2578952 Anybody bring any extra bags?
2579119 2582080 No, nobody brought an extra bag!
2582247 2583874 I'm just askin'.
2584040 2585834 Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?
2586001 2587210 Oh, well, shitfire!
2587377 2590464 If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,<br />that just defeats the purpose!
2590630 2592591 Well, I can't see<br />in this fuckin' thing!
2592758 2595469 I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing<br />and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!
2595635 2598054 Well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!
2598221 2602017 Now, I watched my wife work all day<br />gettin' 30 bags together
2602184 2604186 for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,
2604352 2608106 and all I can hear is<br />criticize, criticize, criticize!
2608273 2611443 From now on, don't ask me<br />or mine for nothin'!
2612736 2615614 Now, look, let's not forget<br />why we're here.
2615781 2618867 We got a killer nigger<br />over that hill there!
2619034 2620368 And we gotta make a lesson out of him.
2620535 2624372 OK, I'm confused.<br />Are the bags on or off?
2624539 2629336 I think we all think<br />the bag was a nice idea.
2629503 2630462 - Yeah.<br />- [mumbling agreements]
2630629 2634716 But, not pointin' any fingers,<br />they coulda been done better.
2635675 2639387 So how 'bout no bags this time,
2639554 2644559 but next time we do the bags right<br />and then we go full regalia.
2644726 2646728 - I like that idea a lot.<br />- You get my vote, Robert.
2646895 2650232 Wait a minute!<br />I didn't say no bags.
2650398 2652400 But nobody can see.
2652567 2653652 So?
2653819 2655695 So it'd be nice to see.
2655862 2660617 Goddamn it! This is a raid!<br />I can't see, you can't see!
2660784 2666164 So what? All that matters is can<br />the fuckin' horse see! That's a raid!
2666331 2669125 - [overlapping shouts]<br />- [man] Sons of bitches!
2669918 2671628 I can't see shit!
2671795 2675423 [Big Daddy] There he is! Get that nigger<br />out from under that wagon!
2676258 2678260 And get that nigger-lover<br />outta the wagon!

2680220 2681638 - What?<br />- They tricked us!
2681805 2682848 Well, where are they?
2683014 2684432 Auf Wiedersehen.
2685892 2688186 - [all shouting]<br />- [horses whinnying]

2704828 2706788 Goddamn it!
2712919 2714170 [Big Daddy] Goddamn it!
2718800 2720510 Would you care to?
2727309 2729144 Can't see shit outta this!
2729769 2731938 - He's getting away.<br />- I got him.
2733982 2735442 [Schultz]<br />Big Daddy's getting away.
2735609 2736860 I got him.
2741323 2743825 - [slow-motion impact sound]<br />- [Big Daddy grunting]
2752125 2753168 Got him.
2758006 2761009 [chuckles] The kid's a natural.
2765680 2767349 [animal yipping nearby]
2771686 2775482 How you know Broomhilda's<br />first masters was German?
2775649 2777901 Broomhilda is a German name.
2778068 2780779 If they named her,<br />it stands to reason they'd be German.
2780946 2783198 Lots of gals where you're from<br />named Broomhilda?
2783990 2786952 Broomhilda is the name of a character
2787118 2791039 in the most popular<br />of all the German legends.
2791206 2793166 There's a story about Broomhilda?
2793333 2795043 Oh, yes, there is.
2801091 2804552 - Do you know it?<br />- Oh, every German knows that story.
2810976 2812352 Would you like me to tell you?
2813853 2819859 Well, Broomhilda was a princess.
2821695 2825782 She was a daughter of Wotan,<br />god of all gods.
2826825 2830036 Anyway, her father is really mad at her.
2830203 2831454 What she do?
2832414 2833873 I can't exactly remember.
2834040 2836710 She disobeys him in some way.
2836876 2840046 So he puts her on top of the mountain.
2840714 2841840 Broomhilda's on a mountain?
2842007 2843258 It's a German legend,
2843425 2846219 there's always going to be<br />a mountain in there somewhere.
2846386 2850432 And he puts a fire-breathing dragon<br />there to guard the mountain.
2852100 2857188 And he surrounds her<br />in a circle of hellfire.
2858648 2862986 And there, Broomhilda shall remain.
2864279 2869576 Unless a hero arises<br />brave enough to save her.
2870660 2872245 Does a fella arise?
2872412 2875373 Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,<br />he does.
2875540 2877584 A fella named Siegfried.
2878293 2879294 Does Siegfried save her?
2881463 2884090 Quite spectacularly so.
2885133 2889262 He scales the mountain,<br />because he's not afraid of it.
2889971 2894142 He slays the dragon,<br />because he's not afraid of him.
2894309 2896811 And he walks through hellfire...
2899147 2901524 ...because Broomhilda's worth it.
2905653 2907322 I know how he feel.
2908782 2911659 I think I'm just<br />starting to realize that.
2917165 2921336 Now, look, Django...
2924255 2928301 ...I don't doubt that one day<br />you'll save your lady love...
2929427 2933014 ...but I can't let you go to<br />Greenville in a good conscience.
2934057 2938520 A slave auction town in Mississippi<br />isn't the place for you to visit.
2938686 2941564 Free or not, it's just too dangerous.
2944526 2946694 But let me ask you a question.
2954202 2956621 How do you like the<br />bounty hunting business?
2958123 2960458 Kill white folks<br />and they pay you for it?
2961292 2962627 What's not to like?
2962794 2965213 Now, I have to admit,<br />we make a good team.
2965380 2968216 I thought you was mad at me<br />for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.
2968383 2970468 Yeah, on that occasion<br />you were a tad overzealous,
2970635 2972595 but normally, that's a good thing.
2973388 2975598 How'd you like to partner up<br />for the winter?
2975765 2977767 What you mean "partner up"?
2977934 2982230 You work with me through the winter<br />till the snow melts...
2983231 2985233 ...I give you a third of my bounties.
2986442 2990363 So we make some money this winter,<br />and when the snow melts,
2990530 2993449 I'll take you to Greenville myself
2993616 2996828 and we'll find<br />where they sent your wife.
3001082 3002834 Why you care what happen to me?
3004586 3006546 Why you care if I find my wife?
3006713 3008089 Frankly...
3009382 3012260 ...I've never given anybody<br />their freedom before.
3012427 3016264 And now that I have,<br />I feel vaguely responsible for you.
3017515 3021227 Plus, when a German meets a real life<br />Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.
3023771 3026649 As a German, I'm obliged<br />to help you on your quest
3026816 3029444 to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
3036201 3039370 [medium-tempo song plays]
3158740 3159741 [man] You got her.
3166539 3171461 Ooh. What happened to Mr. "I Wanna<br />Shoot White Folks For Money"?
3171627 3174339 - His son's with him.<br />- Well, good.
3174505 3176090 He'll have a loved one with him.
3176257 3178760 Maybe even share a last word.
3180762 3182805 That's better than most of them get.
3182972 3185266 Damn sight better than he deserves.
3193441 3194776 Put down the rifle.
3197779 3199489 Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.
3200281 3202617 Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
3206579 3208081 Read it aloud.
3208956 3210750 Consider that today's lesson.
3213169 3215838 "Wanted. Dead or alive.
3216798 3220718 Smitty Bacall and the<br />Smitty Bacall G..."
3220885 3223137 - [Schultz] Gang.<br />- "Gang."
3223304 3226974 "For murder and stagecoach...
3228393 3229936 ...robbery.
3230103 3232897 - Seven-zero-zero-zero..."<br />- Seven thousand.
3233064 3234399 Thousand.
3234565 3238778 "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall.
3238945 3244033 $1,500 for each of his...
3244200 3245993 ...gang..."
3247036 3249038 - Mem...<br />- "Members.
3249747 3254377 Known members of the Smitty Bacall<br />Gang are as follas:"
3254544 3256295 - Follows.<br />- "Follows."
3256462 3260174 "Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and..."
3261300 3263219 Crazy Craig Koons.
3264220 3266472 That is who Smitty Bacall is.
3266639 3269517 If Smitty Bacall wanted<br />to start a farm at 22,
3269684 3271644 they would never have printed that.
3272353 3275773 But Smitty Bacall<br />wanted to rob stagecoaches
3275940 3278359 and he didn't mind<br />killing people to do it.
3279026 3282363 Do you want to save your wife<br />by doing what I do?
3283614 3285074 This is what I do.
3285241 3288786 I kill people and<br />sell their corpses for cash.
3289704 3293499 This corpse is worth $7,000.
3293666 3295877 Now quit your pussyfooting<br />and shoot him.

3319233 3321319 You need to keep this<br />Smitty Bacall handbill.
3321486 3323571 - Why?<br />- It's good luck.
3323738 3326532 You always keep the handbill<br />of your first bounty.
3336292 3339045 [up-tempo guitar music plays]

3450698 3452658 [Schultz] The Wilson-Lowe Gang.
3452825 3455828 Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?
3456537 3461083 Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner<br />Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.
3461250 3464879 Huh. Well, just leave 'em out here,<br />they ain't going nowhere.
3465046 3467423 Why don't you come in then<br />out of the snowy snow
3467590 3469425 and get yourselves some coffee.
3469592 3472136 We had a birthday yesterday.<br />Got some cake.

3544208 3548629 He owns the fourth biggest cotton<br />plantation in Mississippi: Candyland.
3548796 3550131 Candyland?
3550297 3551382 Oh, so you've heard of it.
3551549 3553634 Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
3553801 3556470 Well, apparently,<br />that's where your wife is...
3556637 3558305 - [sighs]<br />- ...and that's the repellant gentleman
3558472 3562017 who owns her. Let's just hope she<br />works in the house, not in the field.
3562184 3564311 Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.
3564478 3566480 She... she pretty.
3567148 3569066 And she talk good, too.
3570651 3572445 But when they tore her back up<br />and then they...
3573654 3575823 ...burned that runaway "r"<br />on her cheek...
3577241 3578409 ...they goddamned her.
3579034 3580161 [yells]
3580327 3581871 - [sizzling]<br />- [screaming]
3583122 3584498 She ain't no field nigger<br />but she ain't good enough
3584665 3586667 for the house no more either.
3586834 3588127 They gonna try to<br />make her a comfort girl.
3588294 3590171 What's a comfort...? Oh.
3591088 3592381 Not while I got freedom.
3593966 3595760 Not while I got my gun.
3598846 3600556 So do we offer to buy her?
3603184 3604560 So...
3606145 3607813 ...say...
3609982 3613194 ...a man wants to buy a horse.
3613360 3615404 Needs to buy a horse.
3616363 3619325 He walks up to the farmer's farm,<br />and he knocks on the farmer's door
3619492 3621160 and asks the farmer to buy his horse.
3621327 3623120 And do you know what the farmer says?
3623287 3625498 The farmer says no.
3626999 3631962 Well, I say fuck that farmer,<br />and I'm stealin' that horse.
3632129 3636258 Fair enough. But now you're a horse<br />thief, and they hang horse thieves.
3636425 3638552 Not to mention the horse<br />goes back to its original owner
3638719 3640346 because the horse is still his property.
3640513 3644391 We need her and we need a bill of sale.
3644558 3646852 Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her,<br />then how we gonna get her?
3647937 3651524 May I offer an alternative<br />plan of action?
3651690 3653192 Go ahead.
3653359 3657905 So... the man walks up<br />to the farmer's farm,
3658072 3659615 he knocks on the farmer's door...
3660324 3665371 ...and asks not to buy the horse,<br />but the farm.
3665538 3668916 And makes an offer so ridiculous,
3669083 3671877 the farmer is forced to say yes.
3672753 3675506 - We gonna offer to buy Candyland?<br />- No, it's far too big.
3675673 3678926 But apparently this farmer<br />ain't all about the farm.
3680386 3682429 How much do you know<br />about Mandingo fighting?
3682596 3683597 What?
3683764 3686600 Can you convincingly<br />masquerade as someone
3686767 3688435 who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?

3726181 3729643 A black slaver is lower<br />than the head house nigger...
3730311 3732438 ...and, buddy,<br />that's pretty fuckin' low.

3756587 3759381 Thank you for your assistance<br />in creating the opportunity
3759548 3762343 - for this appointment.<br />- Nonsense, it's my job.

3789870 3791622 One could almost say youse a nigger.
3792498 3793916 What did you say?
3794083 3796835 - I said...<br />- Nothing, he's just being cheeky.
3797378 3801799 Uh, anything else about Mr. Candie<br />that I should know before I meet him?
3801966 3803968 Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.
3804134 3805928 [chuckles]<br />What civilized people aren't?
3806095 3808347 And he prefers Monsieur Candie<br />to Mr. Candie.
3808514 3810975 [speaks French]
3811141 3815145 He doesn't speak French. Don't speak<br />French to him, it'll embarrass him.

3931178 3933972 Come on, now, boy!<br />It's a fight to the death!
3934139 3937226 - [grunting]<br />- You either hit him or are you ain't?
3937392 3938685 [yelling]
3941772 3944024 [speaking foreign language]
3945234 3948320 - Big Fred, come on!<br />- [grunting]
3948487 3950030 [Calvin] Turn him around! Now...
3953826 3958163 [Calvin] Use your strength, boy!<br />Come on, now! Use your strength!
3958330 3960082 [man screaming]
3960249 3962042 [Calvin] There you go!
3963377 3965838 There you go! Look at that.
3966922 3969883 See, I told you to put<br />some more power in there.
3970050 3972094 Do what I told you, boy!
3972261 3973720 - There you go!<br />- [bones cracking]
3973887 3976181 - No!<br />- [Calvin] Do what I told ya!
3976348 3979393 Blind him black, boy!<br />Blind him black!
3979560 3981645 [man screaming]
3981812 3984314 - Oh, no, Luigi.<br />- [screaming]
3987526 3991446 - Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!<br />- [screaming]
3992072 3993240 Oh...
3993407 3996243 - [panting]<br />- [man continues screaming]
4000372 4001331 [playing pool]
4001498 4003625 [screaming continues]
4003792 4005085 Finish him.
4009381 4011133 Go on, boy, finish him!
4012843 4014094 [screaming halts]
4015637 4017347 [Moguy] That's why they<br />call him Big Fred.
4017514 4020934 - Worth every penny.<br />- Well, arrivederci, Luigi.
4021101 4023312 Come on up, now, boy.<br />Get yourself a rest.
4023478 4026481 You did a fine job.<br />A real fine job.
4027107 4028817 Mercedes.
4049922 4051131 Tequila.
4061141 4062643 What's your name?
4064811 4066313 Django.
4068732 4070400 Can you spell it?
4072527 4076573 D-J-A-N-G-O.
4078075 4079576 The D is silent.
4079743 4081328 I know.
4088043 4089127 [speaks foreign language]
4089294 4092798 [Calvin] Mr. Moguy, want you to<br />take care of my new boy here.
4092965 4094675 You find him a room<br />with a soft bed,
4094841 4097427 then you bring him up<br />a pony to lick his pole.
4097594 4100347 But you be ready to travel to Candyland<br />tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?
4100514 4101515 Yessir, Monsieur Candie.
4101682 4105560 Before you go,<br />Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.
4109398 4112401 You enjoy that, boy.<br />You've earned it.
4112567 4113860 Yessir.
4123370 4127165 - What's your name, boy?<br />- His name is Django Freeman.
4127332 4128542 [Calvin chuckles]
4130711 4132337 Where'd you dig him up?
4132504 4135757 A fortuitous turn of events<br />brought Django and myself together.
4137467 4139553 I've heard tell about you.
4140304 4143056 I heard you been telling everybody<br />them Mandingos ain't no damn good.
4143223 4145350 Ain't nothin' nobody<br />is sellin' is worth buyin'.
4145517 4149730 I'm curious... what makes you<br />such a Mandingo expert?
4151690 4154109 I'm curious what makes you so curious.
4157404 4159489 - What did you say, boy?<br />- Calm down, Butch.
4160532 4161867 No offense given...
4162701 4163910 ...none taken.
4164077 4165787 [Schultz] Monsieur Candie...
4165954 4169458 ...I'd appreciate if you could<br />direct your line of inquiry toward me.
4169624 4171084 One...
4171710 4174838 ...you do not have anything to drink.<br />Can I get you a tasty refreshment?
4175005 4177841 - Yes! I'll have a beer.<br />- Wunderbar.
4178008 4179843 Roscoe, a beer<br />for the man with the beard,
4180010 4181845 and I will have a<br />Polynesian Pearl Diver.
4182012 4184097 Do not spare the rum.
4184264 4187768 Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.
4187934 4189644 You are, well, you are a neophyte.
4189811 4194941 I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this<br />cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.
4196401 4199613 With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...
4200322 4202199 ...I didn't seek you<br />out for your advice.
4202366 4204493 I sought you out to<br />purchase a fighting nigger
4204659 4207204 at above top-dollar market price.
4207371 4209915 Now I was under the impression,<br />when you granted me an audience,
4210082 4212459 it would be to discuss business.
4215170 4217631 Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.
4217798 4220133 We were discussin' my curiosity.
4222427 4223428 Thank you.
4223595 4226306 [Calvin] Roscoe, Coco,<br />go outside and play.
4228308 4231770 Sheba... you stay right there.
4231937 4233480 I know you didn't mean me.
4235232 4237734 - Prost!<br />- German.
4238652 4242447 Now, according to Moguy,<br />if I do business with you,
4242614 4244658 I'm doing business with both y'all.
4244825 4247244 He does the eyeballin',<br />you the billfold? Is that it?
4247411 4251164 Well, you don't make it sound<br />too flattering, but more or less, yeah.
4251331 4252499 Hm.
4253792 4254793 So...
4254960 4256878 ...Bright Boy...
4257045 4259005 ...Moguy tells me<br />you looked over my African flesh
4259172 4261341 and you was<br />none too impressed, huh?
4261508 4263009 Not for top dollar.
4265178 4267222 Well, then,<br />we got nothin' more to talk about.
4267389 4269516 You see, you wanna buy<br />a beat-ass nigger from me,
4269683 4271935 those are the beat-ass niggers<br />I wanna sell so...
4272102 4274062 He don't wanna buy the niggers<br />you wanna sell.
4275021 4278191 He wants the nigger<br />you don't wanna sell.
4278358 4282654 Well, I don't sell the niggers<br />I don't wanna sell.
4284906 4288577 Well, you won't sell your best.
4288743 4291163 You won't even sell your second best.
4291329 4295000 But your third best...?<br />You don't want to sell him either.
4295167 4299087 But if I made you an offer so ridiculous<br />you'd be forced to consider it...
4299880 4301923 [chortles]<br />...who knows what could happen?
4304259 4306553 And what do you consider ridiculous?
4307554 4311641 For a truly talented specimen,<br />the right nigger?
4313393 4315437 How much would you say, Django?
4318815 4320525 Twelve thousand dollars.
4321234 4322903 [straw slurping]
4325071 4329075 Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,
4329242 4331161 but now you have my attention.
4344841 4350514 Willie. Willie.<br />Hold up! Hold up. Ah!
4350680 4353099 - Good morning, gentlemen.<br />- Good Dr. Schultz.
4353266 4357187 - Beautiful morning, isn't it?<br />- You couldn't have picked a better one.
4357354 4360232 Please, won't you take a ride with us<br />here in the Victoria.
4360398 4361942 [Schultz]<br />Oh, thank you very much.
4362108 4364236 You can tie your horse up back there.
4372452 4373745 [Calvin] Django.
4378542 4382170 Where I part company from many<br />of my phrenologist colleagues
4382337 4387509 is I believe there is a level<br />above bright, above talented,
4387676 4391805 above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.
4391972 4396643 Say, one nigger that<br />just pops up in 10,000.
4396810 4398311 The exceptional nigger.
4399312 4401356 Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?
4402482 4403650 Sun is up.
4404818 4406695 Shining on all of us.
4411449 4414369 - [Calvin] Have a seat, doc.<br />- [Schultz] Thank you.
4414536 4415829 Quite an honor.
4415996 4417706 - The honor is all ours.<br />- Thank you.
4417872 4421251 <i>[Calvin] But I do believe that,<br />given time,</i>
4421418 4424379 exceptional niggers<br />like Bright Boy here...
4425338 4427173 ...become if not frequent...
4428425 4430051 ...more frequent.
4431803 4436391 Bright Boy,<br />you are that one in 10,000.
4436558 4439436 The name of the game is keep up,<br />not catch up, nigger.
4440020 4442105 [men laughing]
4452324 4453700 - Whoa!<br />- [whinnying]
4455201 4458622 - Touch your guns, you die.<br />- Everybody, calm down!
4458788 4460707 Now I saw the whole thing.<br />No harm done.
4460874 4461916 Are you kidding me?
4462083 4464085 - This nigger just...<br />- I said no harm done!
4464252 4466796 Now take your hand off your pistol!
4467881 4470675 Butch, that means you too.
4471885 4474888 Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.
4476389 4478600 Hoot! Get back up on your horse.
4479351 4480894 He broke my collarbone!
4481061 4485357 For God's sake, somebody please help<br />Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.
4485523 4488568 - [man] Yessir, boss.<br />- Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.
4489944 4491321 You better listen to your boss,<br />white boy.
4491488 4493948 Oh, I'm gonna go<br />walking in the moonlight with you.
4494115 4495909 You wanna hold my hand?
4496743 4498370 [chuckling]
4498536 4500538 [rap song playing]
4500705 4502332 [clucking]
4502499 4505168 Willie, take us home.
4507420 4509422 [man] Start moving!
4515804 4517055 Head 'em out!
4562684 4564227 You got a problem<br />with your eyeball, boy?
4564394 4565645 No, sir.
4565812 4567313 You want a boot heel in it?
4568523 4569482 No, sir.
4569649 4572694 Then you keep your<br />goddamn eyeballs off me.
4572861 4575989 You flash that bad look at me again,<br />I'll give you a reason not to like me.
4576156 4577699 Now move, nigger!
4578241 4579659 [horse snorting]
4579826 4581953 You niggers are gonna<br />understand something about me.
4582120 4583997 I'm worse than any of these<br />white men here.
4584164 4587751 You get the molasses out your ass,<br />you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.
4587917 4590962 He is a rambunctious sort,<br />ain't he? [chuckles]
4591129 4592464 Indeed.
4594966 4598344 May we stop for a moment<br />so I may put a word in my man's ear?
4598511 4602223 You know, I'm expecting to fall in love<br />once I see the specimens at Candyland,
4602390 4605477 so before that moment,<br />it would be good if I could have
4605643 4610023 a confidential strategy meeting<br />with my confidant.
4612984 4614819 You mind telling me<br />what the hell you doing?
4614986 4617030 I confirmed that Broomhilda's<br />at Candyland.
4621075 4623661 - You're sure it's her?<br />- He didn't call her by name,
4623828 4627207 but she's a young lady, whip marks<br />on her back and speaks German.
4627373 4629250 Now, while it's not wise to assume,
4629417 4631878 in this instance,<br />I think it's pretty safe.
4632045 4636674 Point being, don't get so<br />carried away with your retribution.
4636841 4638802 You lose sight of why we're here.
4638968 4640762 - You think I lost sight of that?<br />- Yes, I do.
4640929 4643431 Stop antagonizing Candie.
4643598 4648561 You're going to blow this whole charade,<br />or more than likely get us both killed.
4648728 4653399 And I, for one, don't intend to die<br />in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.
4653566 4656569 I'm not antagonizing him.<br />I'm intriguing him.
4656736 4659280 You're yelling abuse<br />at these poor slaves.
4660281 4665703 I recall the man who had me<br />kill another man in front of his son
4665870 4667664 and he didn't bat a eye.
4669082 4670208 You remember that?
4672460 4673795 Yeah, of course I remember.
4673962 4677423 What you said was that<br />this is my world...
4678383 4680385 ...and in my world you gotta get dirty.
4681386 4684264 So that's what I'm doing.<br />I'm gettin' dirty.
4687934 4691104 Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...
4692564 4694649 ...that was the general gist.
4695149 4696317 [sighing]
4698403 4699904 See you at Candyland.
4707620 4710206 [Django]<br />All right, niggers, back at it.
4711499 4713543 That means you too, Moonlight.
4722385 4725013 [dogs barking nearby]
4750413 4752332 [dogs barking loudly]
4760924 4763801 [Calvin] I'll be. D'Artagnan!
4763968 4767221 Now, boy, why do a<br />fool thing like run off?
4767388 4769474 I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.
4769641 4770934 [Calvin] Yes, you can.
4771100 4774646 You might not be able to win,<br />but your ass can fight.
4774812 4777231 Mr. Stonesipher, would you please<br />shut these goddamn dogs up?
4777398 4780026 - I cannot hear myself think!<br />- Quiet down, Marsha!
4780193 4782236 Marsha, hush up! Marsha!
4782403 4783947 Hush up! Hey!
4784113 4786741 Get these goddamn dogs<br />away from this nigger!
4786908 4789160 [dogs whining]
4796250 4799712 Come on now, boy...<br />get on out that tree.
4799879 4801547 Yessir.
4802090 4803758 [dogs resume barking]
4808012 4809389 [barking stops]
4824112 4826239 How long was he loose?
4826406 4829659 [speech slurred]<br />A night. Day.
4829826 4831452 Half the other night.
4832578 4834122 How far he get off the property?
4834288 4835999 'Bout 20 miles off the prop.
4836165 4838292 Pretty far considering<br />that limp he got.
4838459 4839836 Hm.
4841087 4844424 Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan<br />supposed to fight on Friday?
4844590 4846217 One-a this new lot.
4847385 4850096 Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian<br />wouldn't bet a bead on him.
4850263 4852765 [D'Artagnan weeping] Please, Monsieur<br />Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.
4852932 4854434 - Now, now, now, now, now.<br />- I can't...
4854600 4857020 Now, no beggin'.
4857186 4859647 No playin' on my soft heart.
4863109 4865653 - You in trouble now, son.<br />- Yessir.
4868573 4872118 I done paid $500 for you.
4872285 4877165 When I pay $500, then I expect<br />to get five fights out of a nigger
4877331 4879709 - 'fore he roll over and play dead.<br />- Sir.
4879876 4883755 You got to understand<br />that I'm runnin' a business here.
4883921 4886632 - You fought three fights.<br />- But I won every one.
4886799 4888301 Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
4888468 4891471 But that last one, you muddled the line<br />between winnin' and losin'.
4891637 4892680 Yessir.
4895349 4897393 Still, the fact remains:
4897560 4901189 I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!
4901355 4903900 So what about my $500, huh?
4905777 4907695 What about my $500?
4909238 4910782 You gonna reimburse me?
4916788 4919165 You even know what "reimburse" means?
4919332 4921375 - [laughing]<br />- [Calvin] Huh?
4923169 4925671 [laughter continues]
4927673 4929383 I'll reimburse you!
4933137 4934347 You will?
4935556 4937100 Yep.
4939852 4942563 You'll pay $500
4942730 4946192 for practically a one-eyed old Joe<br />ain't fit to push a broom?
4946359 4947485 No, he won't.
4949737 4951823 He just tired of you<br />toyin' with him is all.
4952740 4954700 Matter of fact, so am I.
4954867 4957328 But we ain't payin' a penny<br />for that pickaninny.
4957495 4959288 Ain't got no use for him.<br />Ain't that right, doc?
4961040 4962250 You heard him.
4971425 4975179 You're gonna have to excuse<br />Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.
4975346 4979016 He ain't never seen a<br />nigger like you ever in his life.
4979809 4981769 Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?
4984021 4985481 That right.
4986482 4987817 [Calvin] For that matter...
4989110 4990695 ...nor have I.
4996784 4997952 Now...
4999120 5002248 ...seein' as you won't pay a penny<br />for this pickaninny here...
5004750 5008087 ...you won't mind me handlin'<br />this nigger any way I see fit?
5009213 5010756 He's your nigger.
5014510 5016596 Mr. Stonesipher?
5017388 5021350 Let Marsha and her bitches<br />send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
5021517 5026314 - Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!<br />- [barks echoing]
5027773 5029984 Get 'im, get 'im!
5031027 5033529 - Yeah!<br />- Whoo!
5033696 5035114 Whoo-ee!
5040328 5042955 - [dogs snarling]<br />- [screaming]
5063476 5065519 Your boss looks a little<br />green around the gills
5065686 5067855 for a blood sport like nigger fighting.
5068022 5072652 Nah, he just ain't used to seein'<br />a man ripped apart by dogs is all.
5073236 5074528 Hm.
5075613 5076989 You are used to it?
5077156 5080117 I'm just a little more<br />used to Americans than he is.
5080284 5084997 - Hm.<br />- Now, Monsieur Candie...
5085164 5086791 ...whenever you're ready.
5086958 5090336 We rode five hours<br />so you could show off your stock.
5090503 5092129 Let's get to it.
5093339 5097718 'Cause as of now,<br />if he's an example, I ain't impressed.
5099929 5101347 Follow me.
5113818 5115653 [snarling]
5121492 5122910 [clucking]
5123077 5124287 [nickering]
5218631 5221342 Line 'em up to the left here now, boy.
5222968 5224345 Stand up straight, now!
5225513 5226806 Get up there.
5226972 5229558 Get up there, boy. Come on.
5229725 5231352 Give me a line! Give me a line!
5231519 5233604 Get in line there! Straighten up!
5291328 5292538 [indistinct chatter]
5293247 5294874 Hello! Stephen, my boy!
5295040 5297710 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />Hello, my ass.
5297877 5300838 Who this nigger up on that nag?
5301005 5304341 Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?<br />What's-a matter? Why you so ornery?
5304508 5306886 - You miss me, huh?<br />- Oh, yessir. [laughs]
5307052 5310598 I miss you like a hog miss slop!
5310764 5314685 - Like a baby miss mammy's titty.<br />- [all chuckling]
5314852 5318689 I miss you like I misses<br />a rock in my shoe.
5318856 5320941 [laughing]
5321108 5325571 Now, I axed you:<br />Who this nigger on that nag?
5325738 5327406 Hey, Snowball?
5328616 5332203 Wanna know my name or<br />the name of my horse, you ask me.
5332369 5335206 Just who the hell you callin'<br />"Snowball," horse boy?
5335372 5337041 I'll snatch your<br />black ass off that nag there
5337208 5338584 - and in the mud so fast...<br />- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
5338751 5340836 - ...make your head spin.<br />- Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.
5341003 5345299 Let's keep it funny.<br />Django here's a free man.
5345466 5347843 - This nigger here?<br />- That nigger there.
5348010 5350262 Let me at least<br />introduce the two of you.
5350429 5354225 Django, this is another cheeky<br />black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
5354391 5357645 Stephen, this here's Django.<br />You two oughta hate each other.
5357811 5361815 Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger<br />you feels the need to entertain?
5361982 5365903 Django and his friend in gray here,<br />Dr. Schultz, are customers.
5366070 5367446 And they are our guests, Stephen.
5367613 5371116 And you, you old decrepit bastard,<br />oughta show them every hospitality.
5371283 5373661 - You understand that?<br />- Yessir. Him I understand.
5373827 5375496 But I don't know why<br />I got to take lip off this nigger.
5375663 5378290 You don't have to know why.<br />Do you understand?
5379291 5380793 Yessir. I understand.
5380960 5383420 Well, good.<br />They're spendin' the night.
5383587 5385714 Go up in the guest bedrooms<br />and get two ready.
5386882 5388551 He gonna stay in The Big House?
5388717 5390928 Stephen, he's a slaver.<br />It's different.
5391095 5393681 - In The Big House?<br />- Well, you got a problem with that?
5393847 5396141 Oh, no.<br />I ain't got no problem with it,
5396308 5398352 if you ain't got no problem<br />with burnin' the bed, the sheets,
5398519 5400854 the pillowcases, everything else when<br />this black-ass motherfucker's gone!
5401021 5403274 That is my problem!<br />They are mine to burn!
5403440 5405651 Now your problem right now<br />is makin' a good impression!
5405818 5407736 And I want you to start solvin'<br />that problem right now
5407903 5409530 and get them goddamn rooms ready!
5411657 5413576 Yessir, Monsieur Candie.
5415035 5416203 Go on, now.
5417121 5419540 Can't believe you brought<br />a nigger to stay in The Big House.
5419707 5421041 Your daddy rollin' over<br />in his goddamned grave.
5421208 5424753 Man, the lip on him. Whoo!<br />He's gettin' worse and worse.
5424920 5426088 Now...
5426255 5430926 Where is my beautiful sister?!
5431093 5434179 There she is!<br />Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
5434346 5439393 Dr. Schultz, this attractive<br />Southern belle is my widowed sister.
5439560 5443564 Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes.
5444815 5448193 May I present to you<br />Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
5448360 5451739 Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.<br />Y'all get your ass over by that pen.
5451905 5454033 - Come on, Charly. Come on, now!<br />- Let's go.
5454199 5455242 You know where it is.
5455409 5457161 Like you on a rope!
5458370 5461123 Niggers don't walk around here,<br />niggers run!
5461832 5464835 - Monsieur Candie?<br />- Hm?
5465002 5468797 Yeah. About that matter about the<br />nigger girl you were talking about?
5468964 5469923 Nigger gal?
5470090 5473093 Yeah, I believe you mentioned<br />she spoke German.
5473260 5475846 Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?
5476013 5480184 Do you think before the demonstration,<br />you could send her around to my room?
5480351 5484521 [laughs] You little dickens, you.<br />I don't see why not.
5484688 5488067 Stephen, when you get through showin'<br />them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,
5488233 5490069 get her cleaned up<br />and smellin' real nice,
5490235 5491654 and sent over to<br />Dr. Schultz's room here.
5491820 5493489 Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,
5493656 5496325 there's-a somethin'<br />I ain't told you 'bout yet.
5496533 5500204 - What?<br />- [stammers] Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box.
5501705 5502873 [Calvin] What's she doin' there?
5503040 5505793 [Stephen] What you think she<br />doin' there in the Hot Box?
5505959 5507419 She bein' punished.
5507586 5509922 - [Calvin] What she do?<br />- [Stephen] She run off again.
5510089 5512758 Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people<br />ran away while I was gone?
5512925 5515427 - Two.<br />- When did she go?
5515594 5518097 Last night.<br />They brung her back this morning.
5518263 5520933 How bad did Stonesipher's dogs<br />tear her up?
5521850 5525354 [Stephen] Lucky for her,<br />they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.
5525521 5529817 Bill and Cody went lookin' for her,<br />found her, brung her back.
5529983 5532903 Now, she a little beat-up.<br />But she done that to her own damn self
5533070 5534279 runnin' through them<br />damn bushes and shit.
5534446 5536115 [Calvin]<br />How long she been in the box?
5536281 5539076 [Stephen] How long you think<br />she been in there? All damn day.
5539243 5541912 And the little bitch<br />got ten more days to be in there.
5542079 5545124 - Still, take her out.<br />- Take her out? Why?
5545290 5549211 Because I said so, that's why.<br />Dr. Schultz is my guest.
5549378 5550337 Hildi is my nigger.
5550504 5553674 Southern hospitality dictates<br />I make her available to him.
5553841 5557052 - But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.<br />- Jesus Christ, Stephen.
5557219 5559638 What is the point of havin'<br />a nigger that speaks German
5559805 5562266 if you can't wheel 'em out<br />when you have a German guest?
5562433 5566603 Now, I realize it is inconvenient,<br />but still, you take her ass out.
5566770 5567938 Yessir.
5569231 5571817 [Calvin] Lara Lee!<br />Will you and Cora be responsible
5571984 5575362 for gettin' Hildi cleaned up<br />and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.
5575529 5576905 [Lara Lee] Of course, darlin'.
5577072 5581952 Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am<br />weary from our travels beyond words.
5582119 5584997 It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.
5587458 5589668 [clucking]
5589835 5592588 Y'all done heard the man!<br />Get her ass up outta there!
5592755 5595299 Cora! Come here!
5595466 5598510 Get over there and get her cleaned up,<br />bring her back over here to Dr...
5598677 5601054 - What he say your name is? Shoots?<br />- Schultz.
5601221 5603682 Schultz. Get her back over here.<br />Hurry up, girl.
5603849 5607227 - Yessir.<br />- [soft guitar music plays]
5648101 5649978 [Hildi screams]
5650813 5653524 Come on, girl. Stand up.
5654733 5656109 [Hildi yelling]
5656276 5659822 [gasping, screaming]
5661114 5663575 [sobbing]
5683554 5687099 Is you comin' with me or is you gonna<br />sleep in that little box over yonder?
5689810 5692479 [slow-tempo song plays]
5696024 5698652 [woman sings in foreign language]
5774353 5775520 [exhales]
5782277 5783737 Hello, ladies.
5783904 5787282 Dr. Schultz.<br />May I introduce to you Broomhilda?
5791453 5793914 Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.
5795374 5797501 It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.
5798543 5800879 I've heard a lot of<br />good things about you.
5801046 5803840 Well, it's not every nigger<br />speaks German, don't ya know.
5804007 5805926 - [chuckles]<br />- [forced chuckle]
5807094 5809096 As I look at you now, Broomhilda,
5809262 5814226 I can see all the passions you inspire<br />are completely justified.
5817562 5819898 The doctor here speaks German.
5821900 5823860 And I've been informed you do as well?
5825404 5827572 Go ahead, girl.<br />Speak a little German.
5829700 5833328 [speaking German]
5834121 5835747 Ha! [laughs]
5835914 5837916 Astonishing.
5838083 5839751 [speaking German]
5844881 5847092 - And I shall bring you...<br />- [Schultz] Much obliged.
5856601 5857728 <i>Ja.</i>
5878373 5879958 [speaks German]
5881126 5882586 Don't be afraid.
5920665 5923168 Hm. Pardon.
5930759 5932052 <i>Danke.</i>
5975887 5977514 [chuckling]
6020307 6022350 [repeats German phrase]
6037490 6039075 Hey, Little Trouble Maker.
6039659 6041244 [gasping]
6043663 6044831 [moaning]
6047667 6050962 You silver-tongued devil, you.
6052547 6053882 - Hurry up, girl.<br />- These ready, Miss Cora.
6054049 6055300 No, no, no, they drinkin' tonight.
6055467 6058428 Go downstairs, get the big jug with the<br />red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?
6058595 6061348 - Get your big pretty ass out the way.<br />- You know you like it.
6061514 6063725 [laughs] That's 'cause<br />you knows what I like.
6063892 6066478 Ooh!<br />Come on with these biscuits, girl.
6066645 6072442 Look, Monsieur Candie, they were<br />all fine specimens, no doubt about it.
6072609 6076988 But the best three by far were Samson...
6078365 6079950 - What's that other one's name?<br />- Goldie.
6080116 6083453 Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.
6083620 6086206 By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?
6086373 6089459 [chuckles] You never know how<br />these nigger nicknames get started.
6089626 6092212 His name was Joe, maybe one day<br />he said he was cold. Who knows?
6092379 6094381 [all laugh]
6095882 6101221 Well, regardless, Samson's your best.<br />We all know that.
6101388 6105100 You will never sell him,<br />and I can see why. He's a champion.
6105267 6109020 Hm-hm.<br />All three are champions.
6109688 6111773 Samson's the champion.
6111940 6113733 Them other two pretty good.
6115026 6116528 Calvin, now what's<br />this nigger you let...
6116695 6117821 It's all right.
6117988 6120073 You have to understand,<br />Monsieur Candie,
6120240 6123618 while admittedly a neophyte<br />in the nigger fight game,
6123785 6128081 I do have a little bit of a background<br />in the European traveling circus.
6128248 6129332 Is that right?
6129499 6133586 Hence, I have big ideas<br />when it comes to presentation.
6133753 6134713 Hm.
6134879 6137340 I need something more<br />than just a big nigger.
6139092 6141303 Yeah, he needs to have panache.
6141469 6144556 - Need to have what? What?<br />- Panache. Uh...
6144723 6147475 - A sense of showmanship.<br />- Showmanship, yes.
6147642 6150854 I want to be able to bill him<br />as The Black Hercules.
6151021 6152647 [all chuckling]
6152814 6154190 The Black Hercules,<br />isn't that clever?
6154357 6155358 More like Nigger-les.
6155525 6157652 [laughing]
6157819 6163199 I said, and I quote:<br />"I would pay top dollar for...
6163700 6166494 ...'the right nigger.'"
6166661 6170957 Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe<br />is the wrong nigger, per se.
6171124 6173835 But is he right as rain?
6175086 6176504 Oh, Dr. Schultz,
6176671 6180467 I will have you know there<br />is no one in the nigger fight game
6180633 6182552 that appreciates<br />the value of showmanship
6182719 6184471 more than Monsieur<br />Calvin J. Candie here.
6184637 6185638 Nobody.
6185805 6187640 But one must not forget<br />the most important thing
6187807 6189184 - in the nigger fight game.<br />- Hm-mm.
6189351 6191353 And that is a nigger<br />that can win fights.
6191519 6192729 Hm-mm.
6192896 6197108 Now that should be your first, second,<br />third, fourth, and fifth concern.
6197275 6199319 Now, after you have that,<br />and you know you have that,
6199486 6203448 then you can start<br />to implement a grand design.
6203615 6206159 In other words, first thing is first.
6206326 6207786 First thing's first.
6212624 6214250 [whispers in German]
6215460 6218838 Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.
6219005 6220882 Famously.
6221633 6224302 Oh, Monsieur Candie,<br />you can't imagine what it's like
6224469 6227806 not to hear your<br />native tongue in four years.
6227972 6229808 Well, hell,<br />I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.
6229974 6232060 [laughing]
6232227 6234270 Two weeks in Boston!
6234437 6237232 - Monsieur Candie, you a mess!<br />- [coughing]
6237399 6239109 [Stephen] Two weeks in Boston!
6239275 6244489 I can't express the joy I felt<br />conversing in my mother tongue.
6244656 6248743 And Hildi is a charming<br />conversation companion.
6248910 6250787 [Calvin] Well, be careful now,<br />Dr. Schultz.
6250954 6252288 You might-a caught yourself
6252455 6253706 - a little dose of nigger love.<br />- Hm!
6253873 6255959 [Calvin] Nigger love's<br />a powerful emotion, boy.
6256126 6258128 - [Stephen] Hm!<br />- It's like a pool of black tar.
6258294 6259921 Once it catches your ass, you're caught.
6260088 6263049 Yessir, you stuck. [laughs]
6263216 6264759 [Lara Lee] I don't know, doctor.
6264926 6267178 You can lay on all the<br />German sweet talk you want,
6267345 6271850 but it looks like this pony's<br />got big eyes for Django.
6272976 6274102 [Lara Lee giggles]
6274269 6276729 Well, naturally.
6276896 6280525 It is the soaring eagle<br />that attracts her attention,
6280692 6283486 - not the plucked chicken.<br />- [all chuckle]
6283653 6286156 [Calvin] Dr. Schultz, don't be<br />so down on yourself.
6286322 6288241 You are quite the dapper<br />European gentleman.
6288408 6289451 [Cora] You got to clean these dishes,
6289617 6291619 you got to put your elbow<br />in these dishes, you hear me?
6291786 6293997 You know that nigger, don't you?
6294914 6296207 - Who?<br />- "Who?"
6296374 6299461 Don't "who" me, bitch.<br />You know who I'm talkin' about.
6301212 6303214 At the table?
6303381 6304632 I don't know him.
6304799 6307844 - You don't know him.<br />- No.
6308011 6310847 - "No," what?<br />- No, sir.
6312932 6314017 [chuckles]
6315477 6317937 You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?
6322150 6323359 OK.
6324611 6327739 Yeah. If you say so.
6334204 6337624 Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,<br />no doubt about it.
6339000 6344172 But if it was my money,<br />I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.
6344339 6346674 What would your price be?
6346841 6348801 Well, if I was inclined<br />to be generous...
6348968 6352430 ...and I don't know why<br />I would be inclined to be generous...
6353389 6356643 ...9,000. Maybe.
6357894 6363691 Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how<br />this whole negotiation came about.
6363858 6366027 You see, it wasn't me<br />who came to you to sell a nigger.
6366194 6367153 Sure wasn't.
6367320 6369030 It was you who approached me to buy one.
6369197 6371366 - Sure was.<br />- Now, that $9,000 figure
6371533 6373952 Bright Boy's been bandyin' about,<br />that ain't too far off from right.
6374118 6375745 And if I wanted to sell<br />Eskimo Joe for that,
6375912 6378873 - I could do so any day of the week.<br />- Any day.
6379040 6383294 But, like you said in Greenville,<br />doctor... I don't want to sell him.
6383920 6387924 It was only your ridiculous<br />offer of $12,000
6388091 6390927 - that made me even consider it.<br />- Hm-mm.
6395598 6398935 [deep inhale]
6399102 6403189 You know, Monsieur Candie,<br />you do possess the power of persuasion.
6403356 6404649 [chuckles]
6407110 6409529 [slamming table] Why not?<br />Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.
6409696 6413032 - Eskimo Joe, $12,000.<br />- [banging table] Hooray, doctor.
6413199 6415326 Hooray.<br />And a wise decision that is.
6415493 6419038 However, that is<br />a tremendous amount of money.
6419205 6422375 And the way you have<br />your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.
6422542 6424335 Persnickety man named Tuttle.
6424502 6427589 And I would need my Mr. Tuttle<br />to draw up a legal contract
6427755 6430800 before I'd feel comfortable exchanging<br />that amount of money for flesh.
6430967 6431968 Hm-mm.
6432135 6433803 Not to mention having<br />Eskimo Joe examined
6433970 6436598 - by a physician of my choosing.<br />- [Calvin] Naturally.
6436764 6441477 So, say I return in about...
6443646 6445940 - ...five days time.<br />- Five days?
6446107 6447358 With my Mr. Tuttle.
6447525 6449569 And then my Mr. Tuttle<br />and your Mr. Moguy
6449736 6452697 can hash out the finer<br />details between themselves.
6453531 6456576 I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.
6457327 6458494 Gentlemen...
6459495 6461497 ...may I propose a toast.
6463875 6468755 To Eskimo Joe.<br />Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?
6468921 6471591 - [all chuckling]<br />- To The Black Hercules.
6471758 6473134 [Stephen] The Black Hercules.
6473301 6474719 [speaks low]<br />To The Black Hercules.
6474886 6478723 You was right, doctor.<br />That name do have pan-ass. [chuckles]
6478890 6480308 Hm.
6480475 6483728 Hildi, top my drink off.
6486814 6491861 So, Hildi, how you like servin'<br />at the big table in The Big House, huh?
6492028 6495239 When Monsieur Candie talk to you,<br />you answers.
6495406 6498159 - I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.<br />- Hm-mm.
6498326 6501079 It's a lot better than sizzlin'<br />in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass
6501245 6502580 through a bramble bush.
6502747 6505833 But maybe it's not quite as much fun as<br />gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,
6506000 6507585 - huh, sugar bear?<br />- Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.
6507752 6508920 - Sure do.<br />- Like Samson? Huh?
6509087 6510546 [Hildi] No, sir.
6510713 6512048 You know, Monsieur Candie,
6512215 6515885 the doctor here might be interested<br />in seein' Hildi's peeled back,
6516052 6519305 seein' as how they don't have<br />many niggers where he come from.
6519472 6521599 Dr. Schultz,<br />when you was alone with Hildi, here,
6521766 6524811 did you just speak German<br />or did you get to take her clothes off?
6524977 6526729 No, we just talked and...
6526896 6529273 [Calvin] Oh, so you<br />haven't seen her back?
6529440 6531234 - I haven't...<br />- No, no, no, no.
6531401 6533444 Stephen's right,<br />you might find this interesting.
6533611 6536698 Hildi, go on, take off your dress.<br />Show Dr. Schultz your back here.
6536864 6538825 - Go on.<br />- [Lara Lee] Uh, Calvin.
6538991 6541369 I just got her all dressed up<br />and lookin' nice.
6541536 6544455 [Calvin] But, Lara Lee,<br />Dr. Schultz is from Düsseldorf.
6544622 6547625 They don't got niggers there.<br />He is a man of medicine.
6547792 6550378 I'm sure it would fascinate him,<br />the niggers' endurance for pain.
6550545 6554132 These niggers are tough,<br />Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.
6554298 6556467 Hildi's got somethin'<br />like four lashes on her back.
6556634 6558553 Lara Lee just get one,<br />she'd lose her goddamn mind.
6558761 6559846 - [Stephen] Sure would.<br />- [Calvin] Look at that, doctor.
6560012 6562265 - It's like a paintin'. Look at that.<br />- Calvin!
6563057 6566102 We are eating. Ain't no one wanna<br />look at her whipped up back.
6567770 6570189 - [exhales]<br />- Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.
6570356 6573025 After dinner, then, Stephen.<br />After dinner.
6574235 6576028 During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?
6582410 6583953 [Lara Lee]<br />Cora, come get this girl!
6584120 6585788 [approaching footsteps]
6587415 6590626 - [Lara Lee] She a mess.<br />- Yes, ma'am. [gasps] Oh!
6590793 6593254 Why are you all undone?<br />I just got you done up.
6593421 6594756 Come on in here.
6601262 6605057 Baby, you on Stephen bad side,<br />and you need to be on his blind side.
6605224 6607185 You say you ain't know him.
6608311 6609395 Huh?
6609562 6615151 I said, you said you ain't know him.
6616319 6619697 - I don't.<br />- Yes, you do.
6621866 6623493 Mr. Stephen...
6624494 6625495 ...I don't.
6625661 6628164 Why is you lying to me?
6630541 6631876 I ain't.
6632043 6634545 Then why is you crying?
6634712 6636881 You scarin' me.
6637048 6640968 - Why is I'm scaring you?<br />- Because you scary.
6642637 6645723 [Schultz] To speak German<br />this afternoon with Hildi
6645890 6649018 was positively soul-enriching.
6649185 6652063 [Calvin] Doctor,<br />that warms my heart to hear that.
6652230 6655066 You stay right here.
6660404 6664909 [Schultz] You indicated earlier<br />you'd be willing to part with Hildi.
6665076 6667912 Why, yes.<br />Yessiree bob, I did.
6669914 6675878 In that case, allow me<br />to propose another proposition.
6676045 6677421 I'm all ears.
6677588 6679298 Hurry up, goddamn it!
6679924 6681509 - Monsieur Candie...<br />- [Calvin] Stephen!
6682552 6685012 You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.
6686138 6688266 [Stephen] I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.
6688432 6691143 My ears ain't worth a damn these days.
6691310 6692436 Excuse him.
6692603 6696357 Monsieur Candie, could I get<br />a word with you in the kitchen?
6696524 6698442 You mean get up out of my chair?
6698609 6701946 - If'n you could manage it.<br />- Why?
6702113 6705950 - It's about dessert.<br />- What about dessert?
6706117 6708744 I'd rather discuss that in private.
6708911 6710788 We're having white cake!
6710955 6713291 What sort of melodrama<br />could be brewing back there?
6713457 6717795 You right, Monsieur Candie.<br />You right. I'll handle it myself.
6717962 6719755 [whispers] Meet me in the library.
6719922 6723009 I just can't understand why you<br />won't come talk to these niggers.
6723175 6725052 Shit get fucked up around here,<br />you blame me.
6725219 6730224 Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,<br />I will be along momentarily.
6730391 6731559 Yessir.
6732476 6736147 Well, gentlemen, as you can see,
6736314 6738065 talented as they are,<br />no doubt, in the kitchen,
6738232 6741861 from time to time,<br />adult supervision is required.
6742028 6743321 [all chuckle]
6744864 6746657 If you'll excuse me a moment.
6752830 6754624 [Calvin] You may clear<br />the dinner service.
6756083 6759462 [Cora] You heard him. Go on!<br />Get! Hurry up, girl.
6759629 6765051 So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you<br />regale us with a tale of the circus.
6765217 6767887 [chuckles] The circus?
6768054 6769555 [fire crackling]
6774352 6776145 What is the matter?
6781400 6786489 Them motherfuckers<br />ain't here to buy no Mandingos.
6786656 6790201 - They wants that girl.<br />- [chuckling]
6790368 6793120 Stephen, what the hell<br />are you talking about? Hm?
6793287 6796457 They playing your ass for a fool<br />is what I'm talking about.
6796624 6800294 They ain't here for<br />no musclebound Jimmie.
6800461 6802630 They here for that girl.
6802797 6805424 Wh... What girl? Hildi?
6805591 6809220 Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,<br />them niggers know each other.
6810930 6812515 He just bought Eskimo Joe.
6812682 6815059 - Did he give you any money?<br />- No! Not yet. But...
6815226 6817687 Then he ain't bought diddly.<br />Not yet, nohow.
6817853 6820106 But he's just about to buy
6820272 6823484 who he come here to buy<br />when I interrupted him.
6823651 6826654 "Thank you, Stephen."<br />You're welcome, Calvin.
6832076 6834078 Where you gettin' all this?
6835204 6836998 Why would they go through<br />all that trouble for a nigger
6837164 6839667 with a chewed up back,<br />ain't worth $300?
6839834 6844130 They doin' it 'cause that nigger<br />Django's in love with Hildi.
6844296 6846132 She probably his wife.
6846298 6849093 Now, why that German gives a fuck<br />who that uppity son of a bitch
6849260 6852346 is in love with,<br />I'm sure I don't know.
6854932 6856892 If she's who they want...
6857476 6861772 ...why this whole snake oil pitch<br />about Mandingos, then?
6861939 6865443 You wouldn't pay no<br />never mind to no $300.
6865609 6871073 But that 12,000? That made you<br />real friendly, now, didn't it?
6873784 6875453 Yes, it did.
6878789 6880416 His wife, huh?
6884295 6888007 If it had been a snake,<br />it would have bit me.
6888174 6889592 [chuckles]
6891302 6893304 Those lying...
6894138 6900144 ...goddamn time-wastin'<br />sons of bitches.
6902354 6903522 Sons of bitches!
6904148 6908944 ...out of New Orleans, so I have quite<br />a bit of practice with theater types.
6910196 6911655 Oh, there you are.
6911822 6914617 I was beginning to think that you<br />and that old crow run off together.
6914784 6916243 [all chuckling]
6916410 6918579 That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?
6918746 6921832 Lara Lee, I was just<br />looking out the big window.
6921999 6925044 Billy Crash is out there<br />dealing with some shady slaver
6925211 6926295 trying to sell a passel of ponies.
6926462 6930341 Would you be a dear, go out there<br />and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?
6930508 6932760 - Of course, brother.<br />- Thank you, darling.
6946023 6949735 - Yeah. Business never sleeps.<br />- Hm-mm.
6951779 6954698 Apropos, before your exit,
6954865 6958869 we were discussing the possibility<br />of my purchasing Broomhilda.
6959036 6961956 Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.
6962123 6964250 And we will again. In a moment.
6980724 6982768 Who's your little friend?
6985146 6986188 [clearing throat]
6987731 6989233 This is Ben.
6990568 6995573 He's a old Joe that<br />lived around here for a long time.
6995739 6998159 And I do mean a long damn time.
6999243 7002997 Old Ben here took care of my daddy...
7003873 7005916 ...and my daddy's daddy.
7006083 7008669 Till he up and keeled over one day...
7011505 7013174 ...Old Ben took care of me.
7015759 7019555 Growing up the son of a huge<br />plantation owner in Mississippi
7019722 7025603 puts a white man in contact<br />with a whole lotta black faces.
7027229 7032526 I spent my whole life here,<br />right here in Candyland...
7033777 7037573 ...surrounded by black faces.
7039617 7041952 Now, seeing them every day,<br />day in, day out,
7042119 7045289 I only had one question:
7049001 7051462 - Why don't they kill us?<br />- [laughs]
7054465 7059637 Now, right out there on that porch,<br />three times a week for 50 years,
7059803 7064725 Old Ben here would<br />shave my daddy with a straight razor.
7064892 7070022 Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda<br />cut my daddy's goddamn throat
7070189 7073609 and it wouldn't have taken me<br />no 50 years to do it, neither.
7076153 7077655 But he never did.
7079531 7080824 Why not?
7082201 7086997 You see, the science of phrenology
7087164 7092253 is crucial to understanding<br />the separation of our two species.
7094088 7097800 In the skull of the African here,
7097967 7100094 the area associated<br />with submissiveness
7100261 7105766 is larger than any human or any other<br />subhuman species on planet Earth.
7106850 7108519 [sawing]
7121282 7123242 If you examine...
7124618 7126787 ...this piece of skull here...
7133085 7136672 ...you will notice<br />three distinct dimples.
7140259 7143971 Here, here and here.
7144138 7145389 Now...
7145556 7150561 ...if I was holding the skull<br />of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,
7150728 7153230 these three dimples would be<br />found in the area of the skull
7153397 7156734 most associated with... creativity.
7157401 7159236 But this is the skull of Old Ben.
7159862 7161989 And in the skull of Old Ben,
7162156 7164450 unburdened by genius,
7164616 7168787 these three dimples exist in the area<br />of the skull most associated with...
7169913 7171248 ...servility.
7172249 7174001 Now, Bright Boy...
7174918 7177087 ...I will admit you are pretty clever.
7179548 7181633 But if I took this hammer here...
7183761 7186096 ...and I bashed in your skull with it...
7187097 7192436 ...you would have the same<br />three dimples in the same place...
7193687 7195147 ...as Old Ben.
7196273 7199860 Hey! Now lay your palms<br />flat on that tabletop!
7200027 7202988 If you lift those palms<br />off that turtle shell tabletop,
7203155 7206408 Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose<br />with both barrels of that sawed-off.
7207493 7210621 There have been a lot of lies said<br />around this dinner table here tonight,
7210788 7213123 but that you can believe!
7213290 7216085 Mr. Moguy, would you be<br />so kind as to collect the pistol
7216251 7218629 hanging off these boys' hips here?
7223342 7225761 - Thank you ever so much.<br />- Doctor.
7230307 7231683 Where were we?
7236146 7237564 Jackass.
7241568 7243070 Ah, yes.
7243237 7245989 I do believe you were<br />just getting ready to make me
7246156 7248617 a proposition to buy Broomhilda.
7248784 7250160 Am I right?
7254164 7255499 Right.
7257918 7259420 Bring out Hildi!
7262172 7263715 Get over there yonder.
7265175 7267428 - [screams]<br />- Sit your ass in that goddamn...
7267594 7268846 [Stephen] Lay your hand<br />flat on that tabletop.
7269012 7270556 [Calvin] Now shut your mouth!
7274852 7277438 Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,
7277604 7280357 you yourself said that<br />for the right nigger
7280524 7284862 you'd be willin' to pay what some<br />may consider is a ridiculous amount.
7285028 7288073 To which me myself said,<br />"What is your definition of ridiculous?"
7288240 7292202 To which you said, "$12,000."
7292995 7294746 - [yells]<br />- Now, considering y'all
7294913 7296874 have ridden a whole lot of miles,
7297040 7301003 went through a whole lot of trouble,<br />and done spread a whole lot of bull
7301170 7303589 to purchase this<br />lovely lady right here,
7303755 7309720 it would appear that Broomhilda is,<br />in fact... the right nigger.
7309887 7313640 And if y'all want to leave<br />Candyland with Broomhilda,
7313807 7319438 the price is $12,000.
7319605 7323400 And I take it you prefer the "take it<br />or leave it" style of negotiation?
7325652 7327196 Yes, I do, doctor.
7328030 7331033 You see,<br />under the laws of Chickasaw County,
7331200 7334745 Broomhilda here is my property.
7334912 7340042 And I can choose to do with<br />my property whatever I so desire!
7341126 7343420 And if y'all think my price...
7344087 7346798 ...for this nigger here<br />is too steep...
7346965 7350427 - [grunts]<br />- ...what I'm gonna desire to do is...
7354348 7357476 ...take this goddamn hammer here<br />and beat her ass to death with it!
7357643 7359770 - Right in front of both y'all!<br />- Easy, big fella.
7359937 7364441 Then we can examine the three dimples<br />inside Broomhilda's skull!
7364608 7368779 Now, what's it gonna be, doc?<br />Huh?
7368946 7370280 - [Hildi whimpering]<br />- What's it gonna be?
7370447 7374326 May I lift the hands off the tabletop<br />in order to remove my billfold?
7375536 7376870 Yes, you may.
7390634 7391843 That 12.
7395889 7397766 - Sold!<br />- [screaming]
7397933 7400477 To the man with the exceptional beard
7400644 7403981 and his unexceptional nigger.
7409820 7412114 - Mr. Moguy.<br />- Yes, Calvin?
7412281 7415951 Will you make these gentlemen<br />a receipt for $12,000, please?
7416118 7417869 $12,000.
7420998 7423166 It was a pleasure doing<br />business with y'all.
7424042 7425794 Now, gentlemen...
7427004 7428880 ...if you care to<br />join me in the parlor...
7429840 7432301 ...we will be serving white cake.
7433176 7434803 [Beethoven's "Fur Elise"<br />played on harp]
7492110 7492778 - [screaming]<br />- [dogs snarling]
7508168 7509628 [screaming]
7520639 7521973 Well done, Calvin.
7524476 7527354 Excuse me.<br />Excuse me, ma'am?
7528814 7532484 Could you please stop playing Beethoven?<br />Take your hands off the harp!
7536738 7537823 [Stephen] Doctor!
7537989 7540617 - Doctor, you can't go in there!<br />- Stephen, Stephen.
7540784 7541952 He ain't got no business<br />going in there.
7542119 7543453 Let it be.
7543620 7545539 He's just a little upset, that's all.
7545706 7547124 I'll handle this.
7572983 7574276 White cake?
7575277 7577529 I don't go in for sweets, thank you.
7578572 7579781 Hm.
7584536 7585537 [Calvin chuckles softly]
7587497 7590208 You brooding about me<br />getting the best of you, huh?
7590917 7595672 Actually, I was thinking of that<br />poor devil you fed to the dogs today.
7595839 7597674 D'Artagnan.
7598467 7602262 And I was wondering what<br />Dumas would make of all this.
7602429 7603889 Come again?
7606975 7611021 Alexandre Dumas.<br />He wrote <i>The Three Musketeers.</i>
7611188 7612856 Yes, of course, doctor.
7613023 7614566 I figured you must be an admirer.
7614733 7619154 You named your slave<br />after his novel's lead character.
7619321 7623033 Now, if Alexandre Dumas<br />had been there today,
7623200 7625160 I wonder what<br />he would have made of it.
7627204 7629039 You doubt he'd approve, huh?
7631249 7636421 Yes. His approval would be<br />a dubious proposition at best.
7638715 7640509 Soft-hearted Frenchie.
7642385 7644596 Alexandre Dumas is black.
7648433 7651228 - Are these Broomhilda's papers?<br />- Yes, they are.
7651394 7653063 - May I?<br />- Of course.
7653230 7654606 Thank you.
7656733 7659694 That is her bill of sale,<br />her ownership history,
7659861 7662030 and, of course,<br />her freedom papers, doctor.
7662197 7664407 Would you have ink and pen for me?
7665659 7668578 - Right over there on that little table.<br />- Thank you.
7689891 7691101 Thank you.
7694688 7696982 Broomhilda Von Shaft...
7699234 7701611 ...consider yourself a free woman.
7713540 7715500 Mr. Candie...
7717460 7721256 ...normally,<br />I would say auf Wiedersehen.
7721423 7725886 But since what auf Wiedersehen actually<br />means is "till I see you again"
7726052 7728388 and since I never<br />wish to see you again,
7728555 7733226 to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."
7737105 7738398 Let's go.
7739357 7740901 Come on.
7742611 7744696 One more moment, doctor!
7746573 7747616 What?
7752329 7754456 It's a custom here in the South...
7754956 7760337 ...once a business deal is concluded<br />that the two parties shake hands.
7761171 7763214 It implies good faith.
7763381 7766426 - I'm not from the South.<br />- But you are...
7766593 7768887 ...in my house, doctor.
7769763 7772682 - So I'm afraid I must insist.<br />- Insist?
7772849 7774851 On what?<br />That I shake your hand?
7775018 7778313 Oh, then I'm afraid<br />I must insist in the opposite direction.
7778939 7781942 - You know what I think you are?<br />- What you think I am?
7782108 7783902 No, I don't.
7785570 7790784 - I think you are a bad loser.<br />- And I think you're an abysmal winner.
7790951 7795914 Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw<br />County, a deal ain't done
7796081 7798708 until the two parties<br />have shook hands.
7799584 7802420 Even after all that paper signin',<br />don't mean shit...
7803380 7806883 ...you don't shake my hand.
7807842 7813515 If I don't shake your hand,<br />you're gonna throw away $12,000?
7813682 7815433 I don't think so.
7816434 7817602 Mr. Pooch?
7819437 7824150 If she tries to leave here before this<br />nigger-loving German shakes my hand,
7824317 7826069 you cut her ass down.
7828989 7830323 [cocking shotgun]
7848091 7851428 You really want me to shake your hand?
7853096 7854681 I insist.
7855765 7858435 If you insist.
7860770 7861980 [metal springing noise]
7875035 7878038 No! Calvin!
7879122 7880707 Calvin!
7880874 7883209 [slow heartbeat rhythm]
7887047 7889549 I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.
7892385 7894137 [sobbing]
7901811 7903980 Nigger's gone crazy! Help!
7904147 7905940 - [screaming]<br />- Help, he's killing everyone!
7906107 7907817 - [gunshot]<br />- [screaming]
7911905 7912947 Ah! [screams]
7913114 7914282 [grunting]
7917827 7919245 [screaming]
7922999 7924125 Holy...!
7924292 7926503 Shit! Son of a bitch!
7927253 7929255 [overlapping gunfire]
7930673 7931883 [man] Damn it! Fuckin'...!
7932050 7934385 - Get the...!<br />- [screaming continues]
7936387 7937847 [man] Damn it, son of a bitch!
7938014 7939557 What...? Fucking...
7939724 7941351 Goddamn it!
7942685 7944979 - What the fuck is going on?<br />- [screams]
7945146 7947107 You shot me!
7947273 7950360 - You stupid son of a bitch!<br />- [man] Sorry, Jessie!
7950527 7954656 Who the fuck gave a nigger<br />a goddamn gun?
7966584 7968086 [whimpering]
7971422 7972924 [screaming]
7978346 7981015 [yelling]
7984686 7985812 [man] Aim low!
7988148 7989983 Nigger! Gonna kill...!
7990942 7993111 [screams] God! Oh, my God!
7993278 7995238 [man continues screaming]<br />Motherfucker!
7995405 7997240 [slow-motion gunshot]
8001661 8003663 [rap song playing]
8004080 8005248 Shit!
8006457 8007333 [screaming]
8062222 8063306 Shit.
8063473 8064515 [door squeaks open]
8073233 8075318 [overlapping gunshots]
8075485 8076903 [Stephen] Hold your fire!
8080323 8081824 Hold your fire!
8083743 8085620 Stop shootin', goddamn it!
8086621 8087956 [gunfire stops]
8094420 8095755 Django!
8095922 8097173 What?
8100385 8102011 We got your woman!
8103429 8105932 Billy Crash here got his pistol<br />upside her head.
8106099 8108685 - [gasping]<br />- You don't stop all that carrying on,
8108851 8111896 - he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.<br />- [gasping]
8112063 8116025 And that ain't no threat, horse boy.<br />That there is a promise.
8117652 8118861 Or...
8119028 8122031 ...you can give up,<br />throw your gun out...
8123157 8125326 - ...we won't kill Hildi.<br />- Horseshit!
8125493 8129205 Honest Injun, Django.<br />I swear 'fore God.
8130290 8134919 You give up,<br />ain't no harm gonna come to her.
8136379 8138798 And I'm supposed to believe<br />your black ass?
8138965 8141676 Personally, I don't give a good goddamn<br />what you believe or don't believe!
8141843 8144887 I believe if you don't<br />give up in the next ten seconds,
8145054 8148933 we gonna blow this bitch's brains out!<br />Believe that!
8151185 8154939 Don't do it. [sniffling]<br />You give me up.
8155106 8156941 - [Stephen] Six!<br />- Just let me go.
8157108 8158651 - Seven!<br />- They got too much.
8158818 8160403 - [Hildi] Django.<br />- [Stephen] Eight!
8160570 8163072 - I love you.<br />- Nine!
8163239 8165325 - [Django] Hold it!<br />- No.
8167327 8168411 I give up.
8169620 8172373 I can't hear you, nigger.
8172540 8175043 I said I give up!
8185345 8188890 [up-tempo song plays]
8198149 8200693 No! [sobbing]
8201861 8203321 No!
8270513 8273516 [door opening]
8273683 8276018 [spurs clinking]
8294579 8297165 Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.
8302462 8304589 So y'all bounty hunters, huh?
8305548 8308301 I knew there was something<br />fishy about y'all.
8309302 8311512 We found your wanted posters...
8312096 8314307 ...and book of figures<br />in your saddlebags.
8315725 8317351 I got to say...
8318060 8321355 ...I ain't never heard of<br />no black bounty hunter before.
8321522 8324567 Black boy paid to kill white men?<br />How'd you like that line of work?
8325610 8328237 Probably pretty good while it lasted,<br />huh?
8330281 8331741 [sizzling]
8334410 8336329 [Django yells, muffled]
8336496 8337538 [grunting]
8337705 8339540 Time to say good night<br />to them nuts, blackie.
8339707 8342376 - [yelling]<br />- On three. One...
8342543 8345421 - [screaming]<br />- I got you. Two...
8345588 8348799 - [screaming]<br />- Calm down, now, here it comes.
8348966 8351552 - [screaming]<br />- [Stephen] Captain?
8351719 8353471 Miss Lara want to see you.
8354305 8358226 Something to do<br />with the Old Man's funeral.
8358392 8362188 Oh, and she changed her mind<br />'bout snipping Django.
8362980 8365816 She gonna give him<br />to the LeQuint Dickey people.
8365983 8367485 [Django moaning]
8367652 8369779 Well, she didn't<br />waste a minute telling me.
8377036 8378829 How disappointing.
8385336 8387129 [hissing]
8387296 8388631 [chuckles]
8401769 8403104 [Stephen] You leavin'.
8404772 8407817 This here what you take with you.
8411195 8414657 Your black ass has been all them<br />motherfuckers at The Big House
8414824 8418244 could talk about<br />for the last few hours.
8418411 8422123 Seem like white folk ain't never<br />had a bright idea in they life
8422290 8425001 was coming up with all<br />kinds of ways to kill your ass.
8425167 8430464 Now, mind you, most of them ideas had<br />to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.
8430631 8436178 Now, that may seem like a good idea,<br />but truth is...
8437763 8440016 ...when you snip a nigger's nuts,
8440182 8444395 most of them bleed out in,<br />oh, about, hm... seven minutes.
8444562 8446147 Most of 'em.
8446355 8449525 [chuckles]<br />Well, more than most.
8450276 8456115 Then I says: "Shitfire.
8456282 8460286 The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey<br />got it worse than that."
8461329 8464040 And they still sayin',<br />"Let's whip him to death."
8464206 8467501 Or "Throw him to the Mandingos."<br />"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."
8467668 8470880 And I said,<br />"What's so special about that?
8471047 8473174 We do that shit all the time.
8473341 8479221 Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to<br />LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."
8480348 8483059 Lo and behold,
8483225 8488064 out of nowhere, Miss Lara<br />come up with the bright idea
8488230 8491692 of giving your ass to the<br />LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
8494070 8499200 And as a slave of the<br />LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,
8499367 8502912 henceforth, till the day you die,
8503079 8506207 all day, every day,
8506374 8509210 you will be swinging<br />a sledgehammer,
8509377 8514006 turning big rocks into little rocks.
8514173 8518761 Now, when you get there,<br />they gonna take away your name,
8518928 8521847 give you a number<br />and a sledgehammer,
8522014 8524433 and say, "Get to work!"
8524600 8527019 One word of sass,<br />they cuts out your tongue.
8527186 8529522 And they good at it too.<br />You won't bleed out.
8529689 8533359 Oh, they does that real good.
8533526 8535111 They gonna work ya.
8535277 8540282 All day, every day,<br />till your back give out.
8540449 8543035 Then they're gonna hit you<br />in the head with a hammer,
8543202 8545621 throw your ass down the nigger hole.
8545788 8551168 And that will be the story of you,<br />Django.
8552712 8554630 [slow-tempo song plays]
8590207 8592668 [man, Australian accent] And what's<br />the golden rule, Frankie, eh?
8592835 8594962 You don't root abos.
8599717 8601177 Hey, white boy.
8602720 8604889 I said, hey, white boy.
8605055 8608142 Shut up, black. You ain't got<br />nothing to say I want to hear.
8608309 8610603 How'd you like to make $11,000?
8610770 8611937 Do what, now?
8612104 8617902 I said how'd you like to make $11,000?<br />11,500, actually.
8618068 8620029 What the fuck are you talking about?
8620196 8624867 Back there at that plantation,<br />Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune,
8625034 8627870 just sittin' there.<br />And y'all rode right past it.
8628829 8630539 You be damned, blackie,<br />we're not bandits.
8630706 8634919 I ain't saying that. Nice thing<br />about this fortune is it ain't illegal.
8635085 8636504 You can't steal it.
8636670 8638339 You got to earn it, white boy.
8639298 8641300 You got something to say, mate,<br />you say it.
8641467 8644678 The $11,500 fortune waitin'<br />for you back at Candyland
8644845 8646972 is in the form of a<br />"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty
8647139 8649475 on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.
8649642 8651101 Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?
8651268 8654563 Smitty Bacall is the leader of this<br />murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,
8654730 8656315 the Bacall Gang.
8656482 8659735 There's a $7,000<br />"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him,
8659902 8663239 $1,500 for each<br />of his three accomplices:
8663405 8666659 Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,
8666826 8669537 and Crazy Craig Koons.
8669703 8671121 Now, all four of them gentlemen,
8671288 8673415 they back there at Candyland<br />laughing their ass off.
8673582 8677253 You know why?<br />'Cause they just got away with murder.
8677419 8678963 But it ain't got to be that way.
8679129 8682424 You and your mates, y'all can ride back<br />there and y'all can go get that money.
8682591 8683676 What'd these jokers do again?
8683843 8687346 These sons of bitches,<br />they killed innocent people.
8687513 8690766 Stagecoach robbery.<br />Innocent white people.
8691851 8694854 I got the handbill right here<br />in my pocket, if you let me get it.
8695020 8696188 Get it out.
8697940 8703195 [man 1 ] "Wanted. Dead or alive. Smitty<br />Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang."
8703362 8704697 - [man 2] But you're a slave.<br />- [man 1 ] "For murder..."
8704864 8707366 - [Django] I ain't no goddamn slave.<br />- [man 1 ] "...and stagecoach robbery."
8707533 8708784 Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?
8709118 8710578 - [man 1 ] "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall."<br />- Hm?
8710744 8713539 - [man 2] That's a shitload.<br />- I'm a bounty hunter.
8714957 8717543 Yesterday, as a free man,
8717710 8722256 I rode into Candyland on a horse<br />with my German white partner,
8722423 8723966 Dr. King Schultz.
8724133 8728888 We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way<br />from Texas to Chickasaw County.
8729054 8731974 We finally found their ass<br />layin' low in Candyland.
8732141 8735644 We went in there to get 'em,<br />things went sour,
8735811 8739148 my partner got killed,<br />Calvin Candie got shot,
8739315 8743485 then everybody there<br />decided to blame me, so here I am.
8745487 8747406 But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.
8747573 8750367 And all y'all know<br />I ain't supposed to be on this trip.
8750534 8753871 But them four men is still back there,<br />they're still wanted,
8754038 8757333 and that 11,500 is up for grabs,<br />and the last thing they'd expect
8757499 8759752 is y'all ridin' back in there<br />and gettin' it.
8759919 8761670 [man 1 ] What's the deal?
8761837 8765299 You tell us who they are<br />and we turn you loose?

8768510 8772014 But, you give me a pistol,<br />one of them horses,
8772181 8776685 and $500 of that 11,500,<br />and I'll point 'em out to you.

8778896 8779939 Now just 'cause it's a real handbill
8780105 8782191 doesn't mean that other<br />bunch of malarkey is.

8792952 8795746 Did that black ride<br />into Candyland yesterday?
8802086 8806048 All right, I'm gonna ask you again.
