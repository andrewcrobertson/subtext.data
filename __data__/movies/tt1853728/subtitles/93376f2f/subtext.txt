259760 262846 Who's that stumbling around<br />in the dark?
263013 266850 State your business<br />or prepare to get winged.
267017 271772 Calm yourselves, gentlemen.<br />I mean you no harm.
272397 274983 I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
275150 277194 Whoa, boy.
278528 280238 Good cold evening, gentlemen.
280405 284743 I'm looking for a pair of slave traders that<br />go by the name of the Speck Brothers.
284910 286328 Might that be you?
287829 290665 -Who wants to know?<br />-Well, I do.
290832 293543 I'm Dr. King Schultz.<br />This is my horse, Fritz.
294419 297506 -What kind of doctor?<br />-Dentist.
297714 299382 Now, are you the Speck Brothers?
299549 302385 Did you purchase those men<br />at the Greenville auction?
302552 305138 -So what?<br />-So I wish to parley with you.
305305 306348 Speak English.
307057 308642 I'm sorry.
308809 311019 Please forgive me.<br />It is a second language.
311186 314564 Now, amongst your inventory,<br />I've been led to believe...
314731 317025 ...is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.
317192 318652 Hello, you poor devils.
319986 322823 Is there one amongst you<br />who was formerly a resident...
322989 325992 ...of the Carrucan plantation?
326910 329037 I'm from the Carrucan plantation.
330872 332249 Who said that?
379170 380964 What's your name?
384968 386720 Django.
387012 389556 Then you are exactly the one<br />I'm looking for.
391349 393727 Do you know who<br />the Brittle Brothers are?
397230 398273 Who are they?
400775 402444 Big John.
403111 404571 Ellis.
405780 407073 Roger.
407240 410035 Sometime they call him Little Raj.
411036 413412 They was overseers<br />at the Carrucan plantation.
413580 414664 Not anymore.
417751 422047 Tell me, if you were to see any<br />of these three gentlemen again...
422213 424507 -...would you recognize them?<br />-Hey.
425216 427719 -Stop talking to him like that.<br />-Like what?
428136 429179 Like that.
429346 431848 My good man,<br />I'm simply trying to ascertain--
432015 433892 Speak English, goddamn it.
434059 436061 Everybody calm down.
436227 439898 I'm simply a customer trying to<br />conduct a transaction.
440065 443026 I don't care. No sale. Now, off with you.
443610 446112 Don't be ridiculous.<br />Of course they're for sale.
447030 448448 Move it.
448698 453411 My good man, did you simply get<br />carried away with your dramatic gesture...
453578 457415 ...or are you pointing your weapon<br />at me with lethal intention?
458708 460418 Last chance, fancy pants.
461670 464089 Oh, very well.
492951 497288 I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast.<br />I didn't want you to do anything rash...
497455 500041 ...before you had a moment<br />to come to your senses.
500208 503586 You goddamn son of a bitch.
503837 505213 You shot Roscoe!
505380 506464 Well....
506673 508091 And you killed Ace!
508258 511302 I only shot your brother<br />once he threatened to shoot me.
511469 512929 And I do believe I have--
513096 514347 One, two, three, four.
514514 517434 --five witnesses<br />who can attest to that fact.
517600 520103 -Damn leg's busted.<br />-No doubt.
520270 523440 Now, if you could keep your caterwauling<br />down to a minimum...
523606 527110 ...I'd like to finish my line of inquiry<br />with young Django.
530530 532407 God-fucking-damn it!
532574 534075 As I was saying...
534242 538455 ...if you were to see the Brittle Brothers<br />again, you could recognize them?
538621 539998 Yeah.
540540 541708 Sold American!
541875 543001 So, Mr. Speck?
543168 545879 Mr. Speck?<br />How much for young Django here?
551176 553928 That iron is nasty business.
559059 561603 Oh, could you hold this for a moment?
563229 564272 Thank you.
564439 566983 Django? Get up on that horse.
567150 568735 Also, if I were you...
568902 573281 ...I'd take that winter coat<br />the dear departed Speck left behind.
586961 591174 Nigger!<br />Don't you touch my brother's coat.
602352 604687 Goddamn it!
608691 611402 One hundred, 10...
611861 613404 ...20...
613780 615406 ...and 5...
616491 617951 ...for young Django here.
618118 620328 And since he won't be<br />needing it anymore...
620495 622831 ...I'd like to purchase<br />your brother's nag.
623581 625708 Also, Mr. Speck...
625875 629796 ...I'm afraid I will require a bill of sale.<br />Do you have one?
630380 633466 You go to hell, dentist.
633800 635593 I thought not.
635760 639472 No worries. I come prepared.
643518 645103 Thank you.
645270 649065 This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
666457 669919 Now, as to you poor devils....
670211 672046 So, as I see it...
672213 675133 ...when it comes to the subject<br />of what to do next...
675300 678136 ...you gentlemen have two choices.
678303 679429 One:
679596 683391 Once I'm gone, you could lift<br />that beast off the remaining Speck...
683558 685560 ...then carry him to the nearest town.
685727 689314 Which would be at least 37 miles<br />back the way you came.
689480 690732 Or two:
691524 693651 You could unshackle yourselves...
693818 695111 ...take that rifle...
695278 698281 ...put a bullet in his head,<br />bury the two of them deep...
698448 702160 ...and then make your way to a more<br />enlightened area of this country.
702535 703745 Choice is yours.
703912 708249 Oh, and on the off chance there are any<br />astronomy aficionados amongst you...
708416 711502 ...the North Star is that one.
712879 714464 Ta-ta.
730897 734609 Now, wait a minute, fellas.<br />Let's talk about this.
738446 742367 You gotta be reasonable<br />in a situation like this.
743368 746496 I'm not a bad guy.<br />I'm just doing my job.
746663 750208 Blueberry, didn't I<br />give you my last apple?
750375 751626 Tell you what, boys:
751793 755546 Take me to the doc in El Paso,<br />I'll get you your freedom.
755713 756881 No. No, please.
804762 806139 All right, now.
806347 808807 I'd like you to take two of these<br />tonight...
808975 810935 ...and then in the morning....
812895 814647 That's a nigger on a horse.
840173 842008 What's everybody staring at?
842175 845136 They ain't never seen no nigger<br />on a horse before.
868034 870244 Good morning, innkeeper.
871496 873915 Two beers for two weary travelers.
874082 878378 It's still a bit early.<br />We won't be open for another hour.
878544 880463 By then, we'll be serving breakfast.
883758 885927 What the hell<br />you think you're doing, boy?
886094 888388 Get that nigger out of here.
893142 894685 Help! Help!
894852 895895 Innkeeper!
896354 899273 Remember, get the sheriff,<br />not the marshal.
899440 901526 Sheriff! Help!
901692 903403 Alas...
904362 907448 ...now we must act<br />as our own bartender.
909409 911285 Sit down, my boy.
920962 922880 What kind of dentist are you?
924882 929512 Despite that cart,<br />I haven't practiced dentistry in five years.
933724 936769 But these days,<br />I practice a new profession:
939313 940565 Bounty hunter.
947238 949490 Do you know what a bounty hunter is?
949657 950825 No.
950992 952160 Well...
953619 957748 ...the way the slave trade<br />deals in human lives for cash...
957915 960585 ...a bounty hunter deals in corpses.
961669 963004 Hat.
976309 978895 The state places a bounty<br />on a man's head.
979061 981731 I track that man, I find that man,<br />I kill that man.
981898 985943 After I've killed him, I transport<br />that man's corpse back to the authorities.
986110 988821 Sometimes that's easier said<br />than done.
988988 993618 I show that corpse to the authorities,<br />proving indeed, I truly have killed him.
993784 996537 At which point the authorities<br />pay me the bounty.
996704 1000208 So, like slavery,<br />it's a flesh-for-cash business.
1001792 1002835 What's a bounty?
1006714 1008216 It's like a reward.
1008716 1011761 You kill people?<br />And they give you a reward?
1012470 1013804 Certain people, yeah.
1014138 1015765 Bad people?
1016349 1018935 Badder they are, bigger the reward.
1019393 1021437 Which brings me to you.
1021771 1025608 And I must admit, I'm at a bit of<br />a quandary when it comes to you.
1026317 1028611 On one hand, I despise slavery.
1028778 1031989 On the other hand, I need your help.
1032156 1035451 If you're not in a position to refuse,<br />all the better.
1036244 1041040 So for the time being, I'm gonna make<br />this slavery malarkey work to my benefit.
1041541 1044252 Still, having said that...
1045002 1046170 ...I feel guilty.
1047880 1053177 So I would like the two of us<br />to enter into an agreement.
1060059 1062019 I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.
1066816 1070111 However, at this endeavor,<br />I'm at a slight disadvantage...
1070611 1073489 ...insofar as I don't know<br />what they look like.
1074782 1077535 But you do. Don't you?
1077702 1079912 I know what they look like, all right.
1080079 1081205 Good.
1081414 1083541 So here's my agreement.
1083708 1085793 You travel with me until we find them.
1085960 1087169 Where we going?
1087336 1091924 I hear at least two of them are overseeing<br />in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
1092300 1096846 That means we visit every plantation<br />in Gatlinburg till we find them.
1097013 1098639 And when we find them...
1099140 1101225 ...you point them out and I kill them.
1103227 1104687 You do that...
1104937 1109233 ...I agree to give you your freedom,<br />$25 per Brittle Brother.
1109400 1110776 That's $75.
1110943 1115323 And, as if on cue,<br />here comes the sheriff.
1122371 1125833 Okay, boys. Fun's over.
1126876 1128419 Come on out.
1131380 1135509 All right, folks, calm down.
1136093 1138262 Go about your business.
1138638 1141182 These jokers will be gone soon.
1143142 1148314 Now, why y'all wanna come into my town<br />and start trouble?
1148481 1151859 And scare all these nice people.
1153110 1155863 You ain't got nothing better to do...
1156030 1159158 ...than to come into Bill Sharp's town...
1159325 1162411 ...and show your ass?
1169960 1172463 What'd you just do to our sheriff?
1185267 1187478 Now you can get the marshal.
1188938 1191148 Marshal! Marshal!
1191315 1193651 -Should we wait inside?<br />-Can we just leave?
1193818 1195152 After you.
1197613 1201367 Move that buckboard a long ways<br />across the street from the saloon.
1201742 1204704 I want six men, six rifles behind it.
1204870 1207123 I want two men,<br />two rifles up on this roof.
1207289 1209417 Two men, two rifles on that roof.
1209625 1212461 All the barrels aimed at that front door.
1212962 1215923 Somebody get poor Bill<br />out of the goddamn street.
1216924 1218843 You in the saloon.
1219510 1222972 We got 100 rifles aimed at<br />every way out of that building.
1223389 1226726 You got one chance<br />to get out of this alive.
1227435 1232106 You and your nigger come out right now,<br />and I mean right now.
1233149 1236736 Is this the marshal I have the pleasure<br />of addressing?
1237194 1238654 Yes, it is.
1238821 1240948 This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.
1241115 1243284 <i>Na wunderbar, </i>marshal.
1243826 1247496 I have relieved myself of all weapons...
1247830 1250624 ...and just as you have instructed...
1250791 1253461 ...I am ready to step outside...
1253627 1257548 ...with my hands raised<br />above my head.
1258841 1261093 I trust, as a representative...
1261260 1264805 ...of the criminal justice system<br />of the United States of America...
1264972 1267975 ...I shan't be shot down in the street...
1268142 1270811 ...by either you or your deputies...
1270978 1273731 ...before I've had my day in court.
1273981 1275983 You mean like you did our sheriff?
1276150 1278194 Shot him down like a dog in the street.
1278360 1280613 Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
1280780 1282865 Do I have your word as a lawman...
1283032 1286827 ...not to shoot me down<br />like a dog in the street?
1289789 1293334 Well, much as we'd all enjoy<br />seeing something like that...
1293501 1296462 ...ain't nobody gonna cheat<br />the hangman in my town.
1297296 1300299 Fair enough, marshal. Here we come.
1302176 1304220 They're a little tense out there...
1304386 1308098 ...so don't make any quick movements<br />and let me do the talking.
1309475 1310935 Come ahead.
1318025 1320986 -You unarmed?<br />-Yes, indeed we are.
1321654 1324949 Marshal Tatum,<br />may I address you and your deputies...
1325115 1327660 ...and apparently the entire town<br />of Daughtrey...
1327827 1330454 ...as to the incident that just occurred?
1331163 1332414 Go on.
1332623 1333791 Thank you.
1333958 1335960 My name is Dr. King Schultz.
1336126 1339505 Like yourself, marshal,<br />I'm a servant of the court.
1339672 1341465 The man lying dead in the dirt...
1341632 1345427 ...who the good people of Daughtrey<br />saw fit to elect as their sheriff...
1345594 1347721 ...who went by the name of Bill Sharp...
1347888 1351934 ...is actually a wanted outlaw<br />by the name of Willard Peck...
1352101 1354687 ...with a price on his head of $200.
1354854 1357857 Now that's $200, dead or alive.
1358023 1359316 The hell, you say.
1359483 1363404 I'm aware this is probably<br />disconcerting news.
1363571 1365030 But I'm willing to wager...
1365197 1369451 ...this man was elected sheriff<br />sometime in the past two years?
1370536 1373622 -Yeah.<br />-I know this because three years ago...
1373789 1377251 ...he was rustling cattle from the<br />B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company...
1377418 1378669 ...of Lubbock, Texas.
1378836 1381547 Now, this is a warrant...
1381714 1386302 ...made out by circuit court judge<br />Henry Allen Laudermilk...
1386468 1388429 ...of Austin, Texas.
1388596 1390347 You're encouraged to wire him.
1390514 1392349 He'll back up who I am...
1392516 1395686 ...and who your<br />dear departed sheriff was.
1403736 1405571 In other words, marshal...
1405738 1408032 ...you owe me $200.
1416414 1417750 I'll be damned.
1445945 1448906 After this Brittle business<br />is behind us...
1449657 1451449 ...you'll be a free man...
1451617 1455621 ...with a horse,<br />$75 in your back pocket.
1457748 1459249 What's your plan after that?
1461752 1463337 Find my wife...
1464088 1465547 ...and buy her freedom.
1467675 1469385 Django...
1470010 1472721 ...I had no idea<br />you were a married man.
1473097 1476016 Do most slaves believe in marriage?
1476809 1478560 Me and my wife do.
1479228 1483774 Old Man Carrucan didn't.<br />That's why we run off.
1484817 1486568 Django.
1486860 1489446 Django, Django.
1489738 1492241 You got sand, Django.
1493117 1495369 The boy's got sand.
1496787 1499832 I got no use for a nigger with sand.
1501499 1505170 I want you to burn a runaway "R"<br />right here on his cheek.
1505337 1506380 And the girl too.
1508298 1511593 And I want you to take them<br />to the Greenville auction...
1511760 1513637 ...and sell them.
1514096 1515723 Both of them.
1516056 1518142 Separately.
1520436 1521979 And this one...
1524064 1527276 ...you will sell him cheap.
1528944 1530654 In Greenville...
1532990 1536534 ...there should be some sort<br />of a records office.
1543167 1545753 You know when she was sold...
1546879 1549423 ...you know where she came from...
1549965 1551800 ...and you know her name.
1552634 1554178 What is her name?
1554720 1556305 Broomhilda.
1557555 1558599 What?
1558766 1560851 Broomhilda.
1561060 1562853 Broomhilda?
1565147 1566815 Were her owners German?
1566982 1568400 Yeah, how you know?
1568566 1571945 She wasn't born on the plantation.<br />She was raised by a German.
1572112 1573280 The Von Shafts.
1573447 1575324 She speak a little German too.
1575616 1577618 -Your wife?<br />-When she was little...
1577785 1581497 ...her mistress taught her so she'd<br />have someone to speak German with.
1582539 1584666 Well, let me get this straight.
1585250 1589797 Your slave wife speaks German<br />and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?
1589963 1591340 Yep.
1595344 1597387 They call me Hildi.
1614738 1617991 When we gain access<br />to these plantations...
1618158 1620786 ...we'll be putting on an act.
1621662 1624622 You'll be playing a character.
1633340 1634675 No?
1641431 1646353 Now, during the act,<br />you can never break character.
1647271 1648605 Do you understand?
1649398 1652317 Yeah. Don't break character.
1654278 1658532 And your character<br />is that of the Valet.
1658907 1660367 What that is?
1661368 1663745 That's a fancy word for servant.
1663954 1665455 Valet?
1666498 1671336 And now, Django, you may choose<br />your character's costume.
1673297 1675507 Youse gonna let me pick out<br />my own clothes?
1675673 1677301 But of course.
1711251 1714463 It's against the law for niggers<br />to ride horses in this territory.
1714630 1717966 This is my valet.<br />My valet does not walk.
1718258 1720260 I said niggers on horses--
1720427 1723222 His name is Django. He's a free man.
1723388 1725015 He can ride what he pleases.
1725182 1728518 Not on my property.<br />Not around my niggers, he can't.
1729394 1731396 My good sir...
1731855 1734233 ...perhaps we got off<br />on the wrong boot.
1734399 1736944 Allow me to unring this bell.
1737110 1740656 My name is Dr. King Schultz.<br />This is my valet, Django.
1740822 1743784 And these are our horses,<br />Tony and Fritz.
1746954 1748330 Mr. Bennett?
1748497 1753126 I've been led to believe that you are<br />a gentleman and a businessman.
1753293 1756964 And it is for these attributes<br />we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee...
1757130 1758924 ...to parley with you now.
1760008 1763262 I wish to purchase<br />one of your nigger gals.
1765597 1768850 You and your Jimmie<br />rode from Texas to Tennessee...
1769017 1770811 ...to buy one of my nigger gals?
1770978 1772604 No appointment, no nothing?
1772938 1774690 Oh, I'm afraid so.
1774982 1777359 Well, what if I was to say<br />I don't like you...
1777526 1779111 ...or your fancy-pants nigger?
1779278 1781488 And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.
1781947 1784366 Now, what you got to say about that?
1786910 1788829 Mr. Bennett...
1789037 1792541 ...if you are the businessman<br />I've been led to believe you to be...
1792708 1797629 ...I have 5000 things I might say<br />that could change your mind.
1801842 1805220 Well, come on inside and get yourself<br />something cool to drink.
1819484 1821278 Maybe while we discuss business...
1821445 1824489 ...you could provide one of<br />your loveliest black creatures...
1824656 1827367 ...to escort Django around<br />your magnificent grounds.
1827534 1828702 Oh, well, absolutely.
1828869 1831288 -Betina.<br />-Yes, sir, Big Daddy?
1831455 1833248 What your Jimmie's name again?
1833415 1834875 -Django.<br />-Django.
1835042 1837377 Betina, sugar,<br />could you take Django there...
1837544 1840714 ...and take him around<br />and show him all the pretty stuff?
1840881 1843633 -As you please, Big Daddy.<br />-Oh, Mr. Bennett...
1843800 1846178 ...I must remind you,<br />Django is a free man.
1846345 1848263 He cannot be treated like a slave.
1848430 1852517 Within the bounds of good taste, he must<br />be treated as an extension of myself.
1852684 1854978 -Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?<br />-Yes'm?
1855604 1860317 Django isn't a slave.<br />Django is a free man, you understand?
1861610 1863945 You can't treat him<br />like the other niggers...
1864112 1866990 ...because he ain't like the other niggers.<br />You got it?
1867157 1870035 You want I should treat him<br />like white folks?
1870202 1871495 No.
1871953 1873330 That's not what I said.
1873497 1875957 Then I don't know what you want,<br />Big Daddy.
1876333 1879252 Yes, I can see that.
1881505 1885592 What's the name of that peckerwood boy<br />from town that works with the glass?
1885759 1887803 His mama work over at the lumberyard.
1887969 1890680 -Oh, you mean Jerry.<br />-That's the boy's name. Jerry.
1890847 1893600 -You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?<br />-Yes'm, Big Daddy.
1894059 1898772 Well, that's it, then.<br />You just treat him like you would Jerry.
1905529 1908448 That house we just left from<br />is the Big House.
1908615 1911827 Big Daddy call it that because it's big.
1912619 1914871 That there is the pantry.
1915038 1918333 That's where Big Daddy<br />hang all his dead meat.
1918625 1920961 Poor little squirrels.
1922379 1924673 What you do for your master?
1925006 1927008 Didn't you hear him? I ain't no slave.
1927175 1929469 -So you really free?<br />-Yes, I's free.
1929636 1932139 You mean you wanna dress like that?
1933807 1936560 -Betina, I need to ask you something.<br />-What you want?
1936726 1939813 I'm looking for three white men.<br />Three brothers. Overseers.
1939980 1942607 -Their name is Brittle. You know them?<br />-Brittle?
1942774 1947612 Yes, Brittle. John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,<br />Roger Brittle, sometime called Little Raj.
1947946 1949781 I don't know them.
1950073 1952033 They could be using a different name.
1952200 1955704 -They would have come this past year.<br />-You mean the Shaffers?
1956246 1958790 Maybe. Three brothers?
1959458 1960876 They here?
1961501 1963545 Could you point one of them out to me?
1963712 1965755 Well, one's over in that field.
1979227 1981563 Old Man Carrucan<br />ain't gonna appreciate this.
1981730 1984566 She work in the house, John.<br />You mess her up...
1984733 1986860 ...she ain't gonna be worth<br />a damn thing.
1987027 1988778 Now, your Bible say....
1993241 1995619 I told you that I was one<br />that made her do it.
1996036 1998622 -You ready?<br />-She didn't wanna run off with me.
1998788 2001625 If anybody should be getting whupped,<br />it should be me.
2001791 2004544 I been here long enough,<br />you know me a long time now.
2014262 2018099 You know Master Carrucan ain't gonna<br />appreciate this. She's a house slave.
2041248 2043792 I'm asking you, please.<br />Ain't this what you want?
2043959 2046461 I'm keeping it funny for you.<br />Now, John, please.
2051383 2052634 I's on my knees, John.
2053134 2055428 I like the way you beg, boy.
2058723 2061059 Is that who you was looking for?
2062852 2064104 Yep.
2065188 2066606 Where the other two at?
2066773 2070652 They by the stable, punishing<br />Little Jody for breaking eggs.
2070819 2072529 They whipping Little Jody?
2072946 2074906 Point me in that direction.
2075323 2078535 You go to that tree<br />and keep going thattaway.
2083290 2085667 Go get that white man<br />I came here with.
2086710 2088295 -Come on, now.<br />-No, no, please!
2088461 2090922 Come on, girlie. Come on.
2091089 2092632 Get you set up now.
2092799 2095885 And the Lord said, "The fear of ye...
2096386 2101641 ...and the dread of ye shall be<br />on every beast of the earth.'"
2102142 2103518 Hey, give me that arm!
2103685 2107105 You better give me that arm.<br />You better give me that arm.
2123830 2125832 Okay, she ready!
2139804 2144142 And after this,<br />we'll see if you break eggs again.
2147145 2148772 John Brittle!
2169751 2171461 You remember me?
2183556 2185850 I like the way you die, boy.
2191314 2193108 Goddamn son of a bitch.
2212043 2213545 Keep it funny!
2238987 2240989 Y'all wanna see something?
2244033 2245577 No!
2255837 2257338 Who were they?
2258089 2259340 That's Big John.
2259507 2261050 That's Little Raj.
2261259 2262552 Where's Ellis?
2262719 2266097 He's the one hightailing it<br />across that field right now.
2269976 2271519 -You sure that's him?<br />-Yeah.
2271686 2273021 -Positive?<br />-I don't know.
2273188 2276107 -If you're positive?<br />-I don't know what "positive" mean.
2276274 2277692 -It means you're sure.<br />-Yes.
2277859 2280820 -"Yes," what?<br />-Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.
2292999 2295084 I'm positive he dead.
2299714 2300757 Django!
2302675 2307472 Everybody calm down.<br />We mean no one else any harm.
2307639 2309182 Who are you two jokers?
2309474 2312352 I am Dr. King Schultz,<br />a legal representative...
2312519 2315188 ...of the criminal justice system<br />of the United States.
2315355 2319734 The man to my left is Django Freeman.<br />He's my deputy.
2319901 2322028 In my pocket is a warrant...
2322195 2326574 ...signed by circuit court judge Henry<br />Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas...
2326741 2330370 ...for the arrest and capture,<br />dead or alive...
2330537 2335291 ...of John Brittle, Roger Brittle<br />and Ellis Brittle.
2335458 2337669 They were going by the name Shaffer.
2339003 2343341 You know them by the name of Shaffer,<br />but the butchers' real name was Brittle.
2343508 2346803 These are wanted men.<br />The law wants them for murder.
2346970 2348388 Now, I reiterate:
2348555 2351224 The warrant states "dead or alive"...
2351391 2354727 ...so when Mr. Freeman and myself<br />executed these men on sight...
2354894 2358064 ...we were operating<br />within our legal boundaries.
2359148 2363361 I realize passions are high...
2363945 2365572 ...but I must warn you:
2365738 2369409 The penalty for taking deadly force<br />against an officer of the court...
2369576 2371703 ...in the performance of his duty is...
2371870 2374747 ...you'll be hung by the neck<br />until you're dead.
2377542 2382505 Now, may I please remove the warrant<br />from my pocket so you may examine it?
2384382 2385508 Gimme.
2402150 2403818 Satisfied?
2409991 2412285 May I have that back, please?
2417707 2419083 Get off my land.
2419459 2421044 Posthaste.
2421502 2426215 Load up the bodies as quickly<br />as you can and let's get out of here.
2451783 2455286 Yeah, that's them sons of bitches.
2495451 2496577 Come on, men!
2498746 2501082 We're coming for you, nigger!
2511551 2514137 Now, unless they start shooting first...
2514429 2515930 ...nobody shoot them.
2516180 2518266 That's way too simple for these jokers.
2519058 2521936 We're gonna whup that nigger lover<br />to death.
2522103 2526566 And I'm gonna personally strip<br />and clip that garboon myself.
2530862 2532280 Damn.
2533364 2536117 I can't see fucking shit<br />out of this thing.
2536701 2538619 We ready or what?
2538786 2540788 Hold on, I'm fucking with my eyeholes.
2542498 2545543 Oh, shit. I just made it worse.
2545710 2548796 -Who made this goddamn shit?<br />-Willard's wife.
2548963 2550923 Well, make your own goddamn masks.
2551090 2554802 Look, nobody's saying they don't<br />appreciate what Jenny did.
2554969 2559390 If all I had to do was cut a hole in a bag,<br />I could have cut it better than this.
2559557 2562226 What about you, Robert?<br />Can you see?
2562393 2563728 Not too good.
2563895 2568232 I mean, if I don't move my head I can<br />see you pretty good, more or less.
2568399 2571903 When I start riding, the bag's<br />moving all over and I'm riding blind.
2572070 2573404 Shit.
2574572 2576240 I just made mine worse.
2578493 2580036 Anybody bring any extra bags?
2580203 2583164 No, nobody brought an extra bag.
2583331 2586918 -I'm just asking.<br />-Do we have to wear them when we ride?
2587085 2590088 Well, shitfire.<br />If you don't wear them as you ride up...
2590254 2593633 -...that defeats the purpose.<br />-I can't see in this fucking thing!
2593800 2596552 I can't breathe<br />and I can't ride in this thing.
2596719 2599013 Well, fuck all y'all. I'm going home.
2599180 2601265 Now, I watched my wife work all day...
2601432 2605311 ...getting 30 bags together<br />for you ungrateful sons of bitches...
2605478 2609232 ...and all I can hear is<br />criticize, criticize, criticize.
2609398 2612944 From now on,<br />don't ask me or mine for nothing.
2613611 2616823 Now, look.<br />Let's not forget why we're here.
2616989 2621577 We got a killer nigger over that hill there,<br />and we gotta make a lesson out of him.
2621744 2625540 Okay, I'm confused.<br />Are the bags on or off?
2625748 2630461 I think we all think<br />the bag was a nice idea.
2630628 2631671 Yeah.
2631838 2635675 But, not pointing any fingers,<br />they could have been done better.
2636926 2640555 So how about no bags this time...
2640721 2645476 ...but next time we do the bags right<br />and then we go full regalia.
2645643 2647687 -I like that idea.<br />-You get my vote.
2647854 2648896 Wait a minute.
2649480 2651315 I didn't say no bags.
2651482 2653484 But nobody can see.
2653901 2656779 -So?<br />-So it'd be nice to see.
2657196 2661701 Goddamn it! This is a raid!<br />I can't see, you can't see.
2662118 2667206 So what? All that matters is can<br />the fucking horse see. That's a raid!
2668708 2670042 Sons of bitches!
2670710 2672670 I can't see shit!
2672879 2676883 There he is. Get that nigger<br />out from under that wagon.
2677049 2679260 And get that nigger lover<br />out of the wagon.
2679427 2681888 -That nigger ain't down here, Big Daddy.<br />-What?
2682054 2683931 -They tricked us.<br />-Where are they?
2693065 2694233 Bull's-eye.
2697028 2698070 Look at them run.
2703242 2705745 Yeah, cowards tend to do that.
2713878 2715588 Goddamn it!
2719759 2721510 Would you care to?
2728392 2730561 Can't see shit out of this.
2730853 2732897 -He's getting away.<br />-I got him.
2734982 2736525 Big Daddy's getting away.
2736692 2737860 I got him.
2753084 2754126 Got him.
2760132 2762385 The kid's a natural.
2772853 2775815 How you know Broomhilda's<br />first masters was German?
2776773 2778609 Broomhilda's a German name.
2778775 2781862 If they named her,<br />it stands to reason they'd be German.
2782029 2784907 Lots of gals where you're from<br />named Broomhilda?
2785074 2787994 Broomhilda is the name<br />of a character...
2788160 2792081 ...in the most popular<br />of all the German legends.
2792248 2794125 There's a story about Broomhilda?
2794292 2796127 Oh, yes, there is.
2802091 2803217 Do you know it?
2803384 2805553 Oh, every German knows that story.
2811934 2814228 Would you like me to tell you?
2815021 2821610 Well, Broomhilda was a princess.
2822778 2826741 She was a daughter of Wotan,<br />god of all gods.
2827824 2831078 Anyway, her father is really mad at her.
2831245 2832455 What she do?
2833414 2834957 I can't exactly remember.
2835124 2837793 She disobeys him in some way.
2837960 2841130 So he puts her on top of the mountain.
2841505 2842923 Broomhilda's on a mountain?
2843090 2847094 It's a German legend, there's going to be<br />a mountain in there somewhere.
2847261 2851599 And he puts a fire-breathing dragon<br />there to guard the mountain.
2853059 2858689 And he surrounds her<br />in a circle of hellfire.
2859732 2864445 And there, Broomhilda shall remain...
2865279 2870534 ...unless a hero arises<br />brave enough to save her.
2871577 2873371 Does a fella arise?
2873537 2876540 Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,<br />he does.
2876707 2878542 A fella named Siegfried.
2879210 2881379 Does Siegfried save her?
2882797 2885299 Quite spectacularly so.
2886175 2890221 He scales the mountain,<br />because he's not afraid of it.
2890971 2895059 He slays the dragon,<br />because he's not afraid of him.
2895393 2898312 And he walks through hellfire...
2900147 2903025 ...because Broomhilda's worth it.
2906612 2908531 I know how he feel.
2909740 2912909 I think I'm just starting to realize that.
2918124 2922628 Now, look, Django...
2925339 2929677 ...I don't doubt that one day<br />you'll save your lady love...
2930386 2934223 ...but I can't let you go to Greenville<br />in a good conscience.
2935224 2939603 A slave auction town in Mississippi<br />isn't the place for you to visit.
2939770 2942731 Free or not, it's just too dangerous.
2945651 2947987 But let me ask you a question.
2955119 2957913 How do you like<br />the bounty hunting business?
2959206 2961667 Kill white folks and they pay you for it?
2962334 2963627 What's not to like?
2963794 2965962 Now, I have to admit,<br />we make a good team.
2966130 2969467 I thought you was mad at me<br />for killing Big John and Little Raj.
2969633 2973846 Yeah, you were a tad overzealous,<br />but normally that's a good thing.
2974430 2976724 How'd you like to partner up<br />for the winter?
2976891 2978559 What you mean, "partner up"?
2979018 2983063 You work with me<br />through the winter till the snow melts...
2984190 2986192 ...I give you a third of my bounties.
2987443 2991447 So we make some money this winter,<br />and when the snow melts...
2991864 2994658 ...I'll take you to Greenville myself...
2994825 2998162 ...and we'll find<br />where they sent your wife.
3002041 3004418 Why you care what happen to me?
3005586 3007671 Why you care if I find my wife?
3007838 3009131 Frankly...
3010549 3013260 ...I've never given anybody<br />their freedom before.
3013427 3017681 And now that I have,<br />I feel vaguely responsible for you.
3018474 3022645 Plus, when a German meets a real-life<br />Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.
3024647 3026899 As a German, I'm obliged to help you...
3027066 3030736 ...on your quest to rescue<br />your beloved Broomhilda.
3159698 3160741 You got her.
3168874 3172586 What happened to Mr. "I Wanna<br />Shoot White Folks For Money"?
3172795 3174129 His son's with him.
3174296 3177216 Well, good.<br />He'll have a loved one with him.
3177383 3180219 Maybe even share a last word.
3181637 3183764 That's better than most of them get.
3183931 3186558 Damn sight better than he deserves.
3194525 3196068 Put down the rifle.
3198779 3200948 Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.
3201365 3204118 Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
3207496 3209456 Now, read it aloud.
3209915 3212208 Consider that today's lesson.
3214169 3217089 "Wanted. Dead or alive.
3217881 3221217 Smitty Bacall<br />and the Smitty Bacall G--"
3222010 3223887 -Gang.<br />-"Gang."
3224346 3227975 "For murder and stagecoach...
3229601 3230894 ...robbery.
3231061 3232604 Seven-zero-zero-zero--"
3232771 3234064 Seven thousand.
3234230 3235649 Thousand.
3235816 3239778 "Seven thousand dollars<br />for Smitty Bacall...
3239945 3245241 ...$1500 for each of his...
3245409 3246994 ...gang m--"
3247536 3248620 Mem...?
3248787 3250289 "Members.
3250706 3255251 Known members of the Smitty Bacall<br />Gang are as follas:"
3255419 3257337 -Follows.<br />-"Follows."
3257629 3260924 "Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and--"
3262426 3264344 Crazy Craig Koons.
3265179 3267556 That is who Smitty Bacall is.
3268015 3273020 If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm<br />at 22, they would never have printed that.
3273479 3276815 But Smitty Bacall<br />wanted to rob stagecoaches...
3276982 3279359 ...and he didn't mind<br />killing people to do it.
3280235 3283322 Do you want to save your wife<br />by doing what I do?
3284656 3286200 This is what I do.
3286366 3290078 I kill people and sell their corpses<br />for cash.
3290829 3294374 This corpse is worth $7000.
3294541 3297336 Now quit your pussyfooting<br />and shoot him.
3307137 3308347 Pa?
3308555 3310057 Pa!
3318482 3322152 Here. You need to keep<br />this Smitty Bacall handbill.
3322318 3323362 Why?
3323529 3327825 It's good luck. You always keep<br />the handbill of your first bounty.
3375371 3376790 That's accurate.
3445192 3448278 Doctor, Django, how the hell are you?
3449321 3451448 Who the hell have you got there?
3451615 3453700 The Wilson-Lowe Gang.
3453992 3456745 Who the hell<br />is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?
3457621 3462125 Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner<br />Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.
3463585 3465963 Leave them out here,<br />they ain't going nowhere.
3466129 3470342 Why don't you come in out of the snow<br />and get yourselves some coffee?
3470509 3473178 We had a birthday yesterday.<br />Got some cake.
3473637 3475138 Pretty good.
3508213 3511633 Keep moving.<br />Get on up to that auction block.
3512968 3515971 Don't let that mud slow you down.<br />Keep going.
3518765 3520434 Come on.
3531903 3533572 Keep going.
3535657 3537367 "Broomhilda Von Shaft.
3537534 3539453 Age 27.
3539619 3541913 'R' on right cheek.
3542748 3545125 Calvin Candie."
3545292 3549713 He owns the fourth biggest cotton<br />plantation in Mississippi, Candyland.
3549880 3551173 Candyland?
3551381 3554843 -Oh, you've heard of it.<br />-Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
3555010 3557387 Well, apparently,<br />that's where your wife is...
3557554 3560390 ...and that's the repellant gentleman<br />who owns her.
3560557 3563101 Let's hope she works<br />in the house, not the field.
3563268 3565312 Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.
3565562 3567856 She-- She pretty.
3568231 3570400 And she talk good too.
3571485 3573737 But when they tore her back up...
3573904 3577365 ...and then they burned<br />that runaway "R" on her cheek...
3578075 3579409 ...they goddamned her.
3583997 3587667 She ain't no field nigger but ain't good<br />enough for the house no more.
3587834 3591171 -They gonna try to make her a comfort girl.<br />-What's a comfort--?
3591922 3593340 Not while I got freedom.
3595008 3597094 Not while I got my gun.
3600263 3601848 So do we offer to buy her?
3604309 3605894 So...
3607270 3608855 ...say...
3610899 3614069 ...a man wants to buy a horse.
3614236 3616530 Needs to buy a horse.
3617405 3620242 He walks up to the farmer's farm,<br />knocks on the door...
3620408 3624162 ...and asks the farmer to buy his horse.<br />You know what the farmer says?
3624329 3626873 The farmer says no.
3627999 3632879 Well, I say fuck that farmer.<br />And I'm stealing that horse.
3633046 3635340 Fair enough.<br />But now you're a horse thief...
3635507 3637259 ...and they hang horse thieves.
3637425 3641429 The horse goes back to its original owner<br />because the horse is his property.
3641596 3645100 We need her and we need<br />a bill of sale.
3645267 3647811 If we ain't gonna buy her,<br />how we gonna get her?
3649062 3652566 May I offer an alternative<br />plan of action?
3652899 3654234 Go ahead.
3654568 3655986 So...
3656278 3661283 ...the man walks up to the farmer's farm,<br />he knocks on the farmer's door...
3661449 3666413 ...and asks not to buy the horse,<br />but the farm.
3666955 3670125 And makes an offer so ridiculous...
3670292 3672794 ...the farmer is forced to say yes.
3673753 3676673 -We gonna offer to buy Candyland?<br />-No, it's far too big.
3676840 3680177 But apparently this farmer<br />ain't all about the farm.
3681178 3683513 How much do you know<br />about Mandingo fighting?
3683680 3684723 What?
3684890 3687225 Can you convincingly masquerade<br />as someone...
3687392 3689519 ...who is an expert<br />on Mandingo fighting?
3689686 3690729 Why?
3691062 3694608 <i>Because my character is that of</i><br /><i>a big money buyer from Düsseldorf...</i>
3694774 3698153 <i>...here in Greenville to buy my way</i><br /><i>into the Mandingo fight game.</i>
3698320 3702157 <i>And your character is a Mandingo expert</i><br /><i>I hired to help me do it.</i>
3702324 3704326 <i>They call that "One-Eyed Charly."</i>
3712042 3714878 We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie.
3718924 3720842 Thank you.
3721593 3724095 You want me to play a black slaver?
3724429 3727057 Ain't nothing lower than a black slaver.
3727265 3730977 A black slaver is lower than<br />the head house nigger...
3731269 3733772 ...and, buddy, that's pretty fucking low.
3734731 3736483 Then play him that way.
3736650 3740820 Give me your black slaver.
3752374 3754084 Dr. Schultz.
3754251 3756962 -Good to see you again.<br />-Mr. Moguy.
3757128 3761299 Thank you for your assistance in creating<br />the opportunity for this appointment.
3761466 3763260 Nonsense, it's my job.
3763426 3766346 So this is the One-Eyed Charly<br />I've heard so much about.
3766513 3768890 Yes, this is Django Freeman.
3769057 3771851 Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,<br />Leonide Moguy.
3772018 3773770 Just call me Leo.
3773937 3777274 Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.<br />You all wanna follow me?
3777440 3780026 How long have you been associated<br />with Mr. Candie?
3780193 3784406 Calvin's father and I were about 11 when<br />we went to boarding school together.
3784572 3787450 Calvin's father's father<br />put me through law school.
3787617 3790745 One could almost say I was raised<br />to be Calvin's lawyer.
3790912 3793164 One could almost say youse a nigger.
3793498 3795000 What did you say?
3795166 3797794 -I said--<br />-Nothing, he's just being cheeky.
3798336 3802757 Now, anything else about Mr. Candie<br />that I should know before I meet him?
3802924 3805135 Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.
3805302 3806845 What civilized people aren't?
3807012 3809347 And he prefers Monsieur Candie<br />to Mr. Candie.
3811891 3816396 {\an8}He doesn't speak French. Don't speak<br />French to him, it'll embarrass him.
3818940 3821318 Get back on top, now. Turn around.
3821484 3822986 There you go.
3823153 3824738 There you go.
3826406 3828908 Why do you want to get<br />in the Mandingo business?
3831494 3835415 You don't intend to allow your second<br />to make the proper introductions?
3836374 3839544 Quit stalling, now.<br />Answer the question.
3842130 3844132 The awful truth?
3844341 3848261 I'm bored.<br />This seems like a good bit of fun.
3853224 3855226 Well, come on over.
3855393 3858146 We got us a fight going on<br />that's a good bit of fun.
3861858 3863651 Won't you accompany me to the bar?
3872869 3876164 You don't wear a hat in the house,<br />white man. Even I know that.
3884047 3885882 -Dr. Schultz.<br />-What a rare pleasure.
3886049 3887467 Keep fighting, niggers.
3887634 3889427 And I might add, an honor.
3889594 3892389 Honor to meet you.<br />Have a seat, the pleasure's mine.
3892555 3896017 Get free man Django here<br />whatever he wants.
3896184 3898520 And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.
3918123 3921292 Use your weight, boy, use your weight!<br />There you go.
3921543 3923753 He's much bigger and stronger!
3923920 3925463 Come on, now!
3925630 3928174 He's not doing what I told him,<br />for God's sakes.
3928508 3930552 Bravo, bravo, Luigi.
3932220 3935515 Come on, now, boy!<br />It's a fight to the death!
3936349 3938268 You either hit him or are you ain't?
3946317 3948820 Big Fred, come on!
3949320 3951739 Turn him around! Now, come--!
3954617 3956369 Use your strength, boy!
3956953 3959497 Come on, now! Use your strength!
3961082 3962792 There you go.
3964419 3965670 There you go!
3965837 3966880 Look at that.
3967714 3970800 See, I told you to put some more power<br />in there.
3970967 3972969 Do what I told you, boy.
3973136 3974804 There you go.
3974971 3976139 No.
3976306 3977348 Do what I told you!
3977515 3981019 Blind him black, boy! Blind him black!
3982645 3984230 Oh, no, Luigi.
3986483 3987525 Yeah!
4005043 4006085 Finish him.
4010507 4012091 Go on, boy, finish him.
4016721 4019807 That's why they call him Big Fred.<br />Worth every penny.
4020225 4022060 Well, arrivederci, Luigi.
4022227 4024479 Come on up, now, boy.<br />Get yourself a rest.
4024646 4027440 You did a fine job. A real fine job.
4028024 4029609 Mercedes.
4050880 4052340 Tequila.
4062100 4063810 What's your name?
4065853 4067438 Django.
4069732 4071526 Can you spell it?
4073528 4077532 D-J-A-N-G-O.
4079075 4080618 The D is silent.
4081160 4082745 I know.
4090378 4093840 Mr. Moguy, I want you to take care<br />of my new boy here.
4094007 4098303 You find him a room with a soft bed,<br />then bring him up a pony to lick his pole.
4098469 4101556 Be ready to travel to Candyland<br />tomorrow morning, you hear?
4101723 4103099 -Yes, sir.<br />-Before you go--
4103266 4107020 Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.
4110481 4113568 You enjoy that, boy. You've earned it.
4113735 4115111 Yes, sir.
4124120 4125288 What's your name, boy?
4125872 4128708 His name is Django Freeman.
4131711 4133379 Where'd you dig him up?
4133546 4137467 A fortuitous turn of events brought<br />Django and myself together.
4138426 4140720 I've heard tell about you.
4141179 4144098 You been telling everybody<br />them Mandingos ain't no good.
4144265 4148019 Nothing nobody is selling<br />is worth buying. I'm curious.
4148186 4150688 What makes you<br />such a Mandingo expert?
4152690 4155109 I'm curious what makes you so curious.
4158446 4161240 -What did you say, boy?<br />-Calm down, Butch.
4161532 4162825 No offense given...
4163534 4164786 ...none taken.
4164952 4166537 Monsieur Candie...
4166704 4170500 ...I'd appreciate if you could direct<br />your line of inquiry toward me.
4170667 4172001 One...
4172627 4175922 ...you do not have a drink.<br />Can I get you a refreshment?
4176089 4178591 Yes. I'll have a beer.
4178758 4181052 Roscoe, a beer for the man<br />with the beard...
4181219 4185056 ...and I will have a Polynesian<br />Pearl Diver. Do not spare the rum.
4185223 4186683 Doc...
4187392 4190728 ...I am a seasoned slaver. You are--<br />Well, you are a neophyte.
4190895 4193981 I'm simply trying to ascertain<br />if this cowboy here...
4194148 4196109 ...is taking advantage of you.
4197402 4200988 With all due respect,<br />Monsieur Candie...
4201155 4203324 ...I didn't seek you out for your advice.
4203491 4207870 I sought you out to purchase a fighting<br />nigger at above top-dollar market price.
4208037 4211290 I was under the impression,<br />when you granted me an audience...
4211457 4213710 ...it would be to discuss business.
4216337 4218673 Well, we weren't talking business yet.
4218840 4221509 We were discussing my curiosity.
4223428 4224470 Thank you.
4224637 4227515 Roscoe, Coco, go outside and play.
4229350 4232603 Sheba, you stay right there.
4232854 4234439 I know you didn't mean me.
4237775 4239235 German.
4239694 4241320 Now, according to Moguy...
4241571 4243531 ...if I do business with you...
4243698 4245700 ...I'm doing business with both y'all.
4245867 4248327 He does the eyeballing,<br />you the billfold?
4248494 4252248 Well, you don't make it sound<br />too flattering, but more or less, yeah.
4254751 4255877 So...
4256377 4259964 ...Bright Boy, Moguy tells me<br />you looked over my African flesh...
4260131 4262383 ...and you was none too impressed,<br />huh?
4262550 4264051 Not for top dollar.
4266053 4268055 Then we got nothing more<br />to talk about.
4268222 4270391 You wanna buy a beat-ass<br />nigger from me...
4270558 4273019 ...those are the beat-ass niggers<br />I wanna sell.
4273186 4275813 He don't wanna buy the niggers<br />you wanna sell.
4275980 4279192 He wants the nigger<br />you don't wanna sell.
4279400 4283988 Well, I don't sell the niggers<br />I don't wanna sell.
4285948 4289619 Well, you won't sell your best.
4289786 4292163 You won't even sell your second best.
4292330 4295833 But your third best?<br />You don't want to sell him either.
4296000 4300379 But if I made you an offer so ridiculous<br />you'd be forced to consider it...
4301214 4302882 ...who knows what could happen?
4305343 4307553 And what do you consider ridiculous?
4308429 4313017 For a truly talented specimen,<br />the right nigger?
4314477 4316354 How much would you say, Django?
4319732 4321943 Twelve thousand dollars.
4326239 4330034 Well, gentlemen,<br />you had my curiosity...
4330201 4332495 ...but now you have my attention.
4345925 4348135 Willie. Willie.
4348302 4350596 Hold up. Hold up.
4351597 4354183 -Good morning, gentlemen.<br />-Good Dr. Schultz.
4354559 4358187 -Beautiful morning, isn't it?<br />-You couldn't have picked a better one.
4358354 4361315 Won't you take a ride with us<br />here in the victoria?
4361482 4362775 Oh, thank you very much.
4362942 4365403 You can tie your horse up back there.
4373369 4374996 Django.
4379458 4383212 Where I part company from many<br />of my phrenologist colleagues...
4383379 4386465 ...is I believe there is a level<br />above bright...
4386632 4389427 ...above talented, above loyal...
4389594 4392805 ...that a nigger can aspire to.
4392972 4397476 Say, one nigger that just pops up<br />in 10,000.
4397727 4399270 The exceptional nigger.
4400271 4402815 Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?
4403441 4404650 The sun is up.
4405776 4407695 It's shining on all of us.
4412408 4414201 Have a seat, doc.
4414577 4416829 Thank you. Quite an honor.
4416996 4418789 -The honor is all ours.<br />-Thank you.
4419206 4422335 <i>But I do believe that given time...</i>
4422501 4425713 ...exceptional niggers<br />like Bright Boy here...
4426130 4428674 ...become if not frequent...
4429300 4431218 ...more frequent.
4432720 4434096 Right, boy?
4434972 4437475 You are that 1 in 10,000.
4437642 4440770 The name of the game is keep up,<br />not catch up, nigger.
4456619 4459413 -Touch your guns, you die.<br />-Everybody calm down.
4459705 4461832 Now, I saw the whole thing.<br />No harm done.
4461999 4465169 -Are you kidding me? This nigger just--<br />-I said no harm done!
4465336 4467338 Now take your hand off your pistol!
4468965 4472176 Butch, that means you too.
4472969 4475137 Everybody stop antagonizing<br />my guest.
4477264 4479642 Hoot, get back up on your horse.
4480309 4481852 He broke my collarbone.
4482019 4484563 For God's sake,<br />somebody please help Hoot here...
4484730 4486440 ...back up on his goddamn horse.
4486607 4489568 -Yes, sir, boss.<br />-Oh, now, you are one lucky nigger.
4490403 4492405 Better listen to your boss, white boy.
4492571 4495032 I'm gonna go walking<br />in the moonlight with you.
4495199 4496993 You wanna hold my hand?
4503582 4506377 Willie, take us home.
4508379 4510381 Here we go. Start moving.
4516971 4518431 Head them out.
4563642 4565811 You got a problem<br />with your eyeball, boy?
4565978 4568230 -No, sir.<br />-You want a boot heel in it?
4569523 4570566 No, sir.
4570733 4573486 Then you keep your goddamn eyeballs<br />off me.
4573736 4577239 Flash that look at me again,<br />I'll give you a reason not to like me.
4577406 4578949 Now move, nigger.
4580785 4582995 You niggers are gonna<br />understand something.
4583162 4585372 I'm worse than any<br />of these white men here.
4585539 4589168 You get the molasses out your ass,<br />keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.
4589335 4592046 He is a rambunctious sort, ain't he?
4592213 4593422 Indeed.
4595966 4599428 May we stop for a moment<br />so I may put a word in my man's ear?
4599595 4603307 I'm expecting to fall in love once I see<br />the specimens at Candyland...
4603474 4604934 ...so before that moment...
4605101 4608813 ...it would be good if I could have<br />a confidential strategy meeting...
4608979 4611107 ...with my confidant.
4614110 4615903 What the hell you doing?
4616070 4618656 I confirmed that Broomhilda's<br />at Candyland.
4621992 4624745 -You're sure it's her?<br />-He didn't call her by name...
4624912 4628457 ...but she's a young lady, whip marks<br />on her back and speaks German.
4628624 4630334 While it's not wise to assume...
4630501 4632962 ...in this instance, I think it's pretty safe.
4633129 4634588 Point being...
4634755 4637758 ...don't get so carried away<br />with your retribution.
4637925 4639677 You lose sight of why we're here.
4639844 4644306 -You think I lost sight of that?<br />-Yes, I do. Stop antagonizing Candie.
4644473 4649603 You're going to blow this whole charade,<br />or more than likely get us both killed.
4649770 4654483 And I, for one, don't intend to die<br />in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, U.S.A.
4654650 4658028 I'm not antagonizing him.<br />I'm intriguing him.
4658195 4660990 You're yelling abuse<br />at these poor slaves.
4661157 4663409 I recall the man...
4663617 4666704 ...who had me kill another man<br />in front of his son...
4666871 4668956 ...and he didn't bat a eye.
4670166 4671208 You remember that?
4673335 4674795 Yeah, of course I remember.
4674962 4678507 What you said was that<br />this is my world...
4679258 4681677 ...and in my world you gotta get dirty.
4682428 4685639 So that's what I'm doing,<br />I'm getting dirty.
4689059 4692563 Well, you're paraphrasing a tad...
4693689 4695774 ...but that was the general gist.
4699570 4701488 See you at Candyland.
4708704 4711665 All right, niggers, back at it.
4712541 4714793 That means you too, Moonlight.
4761757 4762800 I'll be.
4763175 4764802 D'Artagnan!
4765052 4768180 Now, boy, why do a fool thing<br />like run off?
4768347 4770724 I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.
4770891 4772017 Yes, you can.
4772184 4775437 You might not be able to win,<br />but your ass can fight.
4775896 4779775 Mr. Stonesipher, would you shut these<br />dogs up? I cannot hear myself think.
4779942 4782528 Quieten down, Marsha!<br />Marsha, hush up!
4782695 4784154 Marsha! Hush up!
4784697 4788242 Hey! Get these goddamn dogs<br />away from this nigger!
4797293 4801714 -Well, now, boy, get on out that tree.<br />-Yes, sir.
4825112 4827072 How long was he loose?
4827364 4830534 A night. Day.
4830784 4832703 Half the other night.
4833412 4835247 How far he get off the property?
4835414 4840294 About 20 miles off prop.<br />Pretty far considering that limp he got.
4842046 4845382 Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan<br />supposed to fight on Friday?
4845549 4847509 One of this new lot.
4848260 4851388 Way he looks now, a blind Indian<br />wouldn't bet a bead on him.
4851555 4854391 Please, Monsieur Candie,<br />I ain't got it in me no more.
4854558 4857936 Now, now, now. Now, no begging.
4858145 4860939 No playing on my soft heart.
4864151 4867237 -You in trouble now, son.<br />-Yes, sir.
4869490 4873285 You know, I done paid $500 for you.
4873452 4875662 When I pay $500...
4875829 4880084 ...I expect to get five fights out of a nigger<br />before he roll over and play dead.
4880250 4881293 Sir.
4881460 4884505 Gotta understand<br />I'm running a business here.
4884880 4887674 -You fought three fights.<br />-But I won every one.
4887841 4889301 Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
4889468 4893180 But that last one, you muddled the line<br />between winning and losing.
4896266 4898394 Still, the fact remains:
4898602 4902272 I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights.
4902606 4904858 So, what about my $500, huh?
4906819 4909154 What about my $500?
4910155 4911740 You gonna reimburse me?
4917913 4920249 You even know<br />what "reimburse" means?
4928632 4930384 I'll reimburse you.
4934179 4935305 You will?
4936598 4938058 Yep.
4940811 4943105 You'll pay $500...
4943730 4947276 ...for practically a one-eyed old Joe<br />ain't fit to push a broom?
4947443 4948485 No, he won't.
4950612 4953031 He just tired of you<br />toying with him is all.
4953782 4955742 Matter of fact, so am I.
4956034 4958328 We ain't paying a penny<br />for that pickaninny.
4958495 4961248 Ain't got no use for him.<br />Ain't that right, doc?
4962166 4963459 You heard him.
4972551 4977139 You're gonna have to excuse<br />Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.
4977306 4980601 He ain't never seen a nigger like you<br />ever in his life.
4980767 4982769 Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?
4985147 4986690 That's right.
4987483 4988942 For that matter...
4990277 4991820 ...nor have I.
4997868 4999328 Now...
5000037 5003874 ...seeing as you won't pay a penny<br />for this pickaninny here...
5005792 5009046 ...you won't mind me handling this nigger<br />any way I see fit?
5010214 5012090 He's your nigger.
5015511 5016553 Mr. Stonesipher?
5018555 5022184 Let Marsha and her bitches<br />send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
5022434 5024269 Marsha!
5024436 5026396 Marsha, hey, get him!
5029107 5030859 Get him, get him!
5064560 5069147 Your boss looks a little green around the<br />gills for a blood sport like nigger fighting.
5069314 5073694 No. He just ain't used to seeing<br />a man ripped apart by dogs is all.
5076613 5078073 You are used to it?
5078240 5081743 I'm just a little more used to Americans<br />than he is.
5082452 5085747 Now, Monsieur Candie...
5085914 5087624 ...whenever you're ready.
5087958 5092170 We rode five hours so you could<br />show off your stock. Let's get to it.
5094590 5098927 Because as of now, if he's an example,<br />I ain't impressed.
5100971 5102514 Follow me.
5219923 5222384 Line them up to the left here now, boy.
5224136 5225345 Stand up straight, now!
5226430 5227723 Get up there.
5227889 5230308 Get up there, boy. Come on.
5230475 5234563 I said give me a line! Give me a line!<br />Get in line there! Straighten up!
5294164 5295791 Hello! Stephen, my boy.
5295957 5298794 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hello, my ass.
5298960 5301630 Who this nigger up on that nag?
5301797 5305801 Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?<br />What's the matter? Why you so ornery?
5305967 5308011 -You miss me, huh?<br />-Oh, yes, sir.
5308178 5311598 I miss you like a hog miss slop.
5311765 5315602 Like a baby miss mammy's titty.
5315769 5320690 I miss you like I misses<br />a rock in my shoe.
5322150 5326571 Now, I asked you:<br />Who this nigger on that nag?
5326738 5328365 Hey, Snowball?
5329699 5333203 Wanna know my name<br />or the name of my horse, you ask me.
5333370 5336289 Just who the hell you calling<br />"Snowball," horse boy?
5336456 5340085 I'll snatch your black ass off that nag<br />so fast, make your head spin.
5340252 5341962 Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.
5342128 5346299 Let's keep it funny.<br />Django here's a Freeman.
5346508 5348760 -This nigger here?<br />-That nigger there.
5348927 5351221 Let me at least introduce<br />the two of you.
5351388 5355308 Django, this is another cheeky<br />black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
5355475 5358728 Stephen, this here's Django.<br />You two ought to hate each other.
5358895 5362732 Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger<br />you feels the need to entertain?
5362899 5366987 Django and his friend in gray here,<br />Dr. Schultz, are customers.
5367153 5368655 They are our guests, Stephen.
5368822 5372284 And you, you old decrepit bastard,<br />ought to show them hospitality.
5372450 5374494 -You understand that?<br />-Him I understand.
5374661 5377205 Don't know why I got to take lip<br />off this nigger.
5377372 5380083 You don't have to know why.<br />Do you understand?
5380374 5383377 -Yes, sir. I understand.<br />-Well, good.
5383545 5387424 They're spending the night. Go up in<br />the guest bedrooms and get two ready.
5387757 5389426 He gonna stay in the Big House?
5389593 5391928 Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.
5392095 5394598 -In the Big House?<br />-You got a problem with that?
5394764 5396975 No, I ain't got no problem with it...
5397142 5400145 ...if you ain't got no problem<br />burning the bed, sheets...
5400312 5402063 ...when this motherfucker's gone.
5402230 5404398 That is my problem.<br />They are mine to burn.
5404566 5406776 Your problem<br />is making a good impression.
5406943 5411448 I want you to start solving that problem<br />and get them goddamn rooms ready!
5412782 5415035 Yes, sir, Monsieur Candie.
5415911 5417245 Go on, now.
5417621 5420749 Can't believe you brought a nigger<br />to stay in the Big House.
5420916 5424044 -Your daddy rolling over in his grave.<br />-Man, the lip on him.
5424210 5426963 He's getting worse and worse. Now....
5427255 5431968 Where is my beautiful sister?!
5432135 5434137 There she is!
5435513 5440518 Dr. Schultz, this attractive Southern belle<br />is my widowed sister.
5440685 5445023 Darling, you are a tonic for tired eyes.
5445732 5449152 May I present to you<br />Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly?
5449319 5452948 Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.<br />Y'all get your ass over by that pen.
5453114 5455408 -Come on, Charly. Go on.<br />-Let's go. Come on.
5455575 5458078 You know where it is.<br />Like you on a rope.
5459329 5462374 Niggers don't walk around here,<br />niggers run.
5462540 5463917 Monsieur Candie?
5466086 5469839 Yeah. About that matter about<br />the nigger girl you were talking about?
5470006 5471049 Nigger gal?
5471216 5474761 Yeah, I believe you mentioned<br />she spoke German.
5474928 5477013 Yes, Hildi, what about them?
5477180 5481685 Do you think before the demonstration,<br />you could send her around to my room?
5481851 5485355 You little dickens, you.<br />I don't see why not.
5485522 5489359 Stephen, when you get through showing<br />them their rooms, go fetch Hildi...
5489526 5493071 ...get her cleaned up real nice<br />and sent to Dr. Schultz's room here.
5493238 5497409 Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir, there's<br />something I ain't told you about yet.
5497575 5501413 -What?<br />-Hildi in the hot box.
5502789 5503999 What's she doing there?
5504165 5508294 What you think she doing there<br />in the hot box? She being punished.
5508461 5511006 -What she do?<br />-She run off again.
5511172 5514092 Jesus Christ, how many people<br />ran away while I was gone?
5514259 5516302 -Two.<br />-When did she go?
5516469 5519180 Last night.<br />They brung her back this morning.
5519848 5522726 How bad did Stonesipher's dogs<br />tear her up?
5522934 5526438 Lucky for her, they was out<br />chasing D'Artagnan's ass.
5526604 5530358 Bill and Cody went looking for her,<br />found her, brung her back.
5530524 5531901 Now, she a little beat up.
5532068 5535363 She done that to her own damn self<br />running through them bushes.
5535529 5537032 How long she been in the box?
5537198 5540118 How long do you think<br />she been in there? All damn day.
5540285 5542996 And the little bitch got 10 more days<br />be in there.
5543580 5546207 -Still, take her out.<br />-Take her out? Why?
5546374 5548251 Because I said so, that's why.
5548418 5551212 Dr. Schultz is my guest.<br />Hildi is my nigger.
5551379 5554548 Southern hospitality dictates<br />I make her available to him.
5554716 5557802 -But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.<br />-Jesus Christ, Stephen.
5557969 5560972 What is the point of having<br />a nigger that speaks German...
5561139 5563767 ...if you can't wheel them out<br />when you have a German guest?
5563933 5567520 Now, I realize it is inconvenient,<br />but still, you take her ass out.
5567687 5569189 Yes, sir.
5570315 5572901 Lara Lee.<br />Will you and Cora be responsible...
5573068 5576696 ...for getting Hildi cleaned up<br />and presentable for Dr. Schultz here?
5576863 5579783 -Of course, darling.<br />-Now, gentlemen, I do apologize...
5579949 5582994 ...but I am weary from our travels<br />beyond words.
5583161 5586247 It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.
5590710 5593838 Y'all done heard the man!<br />Get her ass up out of there!
5594005 5597675 Cora, come here.<br />Get over there and get her cleaned up...
5597842 5599761 ...bring her back over here to Dr.--
5599928 5602263 -What he say your name is? Shoots?<br />-Schultz.
5602430 5603473 Schultz.
5603640 5606434 -Get her back over here. Hurry up, girl.<br />-Yes, sir.
5651896 5654482 Come on, girl. Stand up.
5655567 5657152 No!
5684429 5688975 Is you coming with me or is you gonna<br />sleep in that little box over yonder?
5783152 5784821 Hello, ladies.
5784988 5788616 Dr. Schultz.<br />May I introduce to you Broomhilda?
5792328 5794831 Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.
5796165 5798459 It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.
5799669 5801963 I've heard a lot of good things<br />about you.
5802130 5805925 Well, it's not every nigger<br />speaks German, don't you know.
5808052 5810179 As I look at you now, Broomhilda...
5810596 5815560 ...I can see all the passions you inspire<br />are completely justified.
5818646 5821190 The doctor here speaks German.
5822816 5824818 And I've been informed you do as well?
5826237 5828822 Go ahead, girl. Speak a little German.
5836998 5838958 Astonishing.
5845798 5848134 -And I shall bring y--<br />-Much obliged.
5882085 5883920 Don't be afraid.
5923042 5924460 Pardon.
6038533 6040033 Hey, Little Troublemaker.
6049085 6052088 You silver-tongued devil, you.
6053422 6055216 -Hurry up.<br />-These ready, Miss Cora.
6055383 6056759 No, they drinking tonight.
6056926 6059762 Go get the jug with the red stuff<br />Monsieur Candie like.
6059929 6063224 -Get your big pretty ass out the way.<br />-You know you like it.
6063391 6065601 That's because you knows what I like.
6065768 6067728 Come on with these biscuits, girl.
6067895 6073150 Look, Monsieur Candie, they were<br />all fine specimens, no doubt about it.
6073609 6078364 But the best three by far<br />were Samson....
6078864 6080992 -What's that other one's name?<br />-Goldie.
6081158 6082201 Goldie.
6082368 6084412 And Eskimo Joe.
6084579 6087164 By the way,<br />why is he called Eskimo Joe?
6087331 6090459 You never know how these<br />nigger nicknames get started.
6090626 6094505 His name was Joe, maybe one day<br />he said he was cold. Who knows?
6097090 6100553 Well, regardless, Samson's your best.
6100720 6102263 We all know that.
6102430 6107184 You will never sell him,<br />and I can see why. He's a champion.
6107768 6110479 All three are champions.
6110688 6112648 Samson's the champion.
6112940 6114692 Them other two pretty good.
6115985 6118821 -Calvin, what's this nigger you let--?<br />-It's all right.
6118988 6121157 You have to understand,<br />Monsieur Candie...
6121324 6124702 ...while admittedly a neophyte<br />in the nigger fight game...
6124869 6129122 ...I do have a little bit of a background<br />in the European traveling circus.
6129290 6130458 Is that right?
6130625 6135171 Hence, I have big ideas<br />when it comes to presentation.
6135796 6138299 I need something more<br />than just a big nigger.
6140217 6142386 Yeah, he needs to have panache.
6142553 6145264 -Need to have what? What?<br />-Panache.
6145806 6148476 -A sense of showmanship.<br />-Showmanship, yes.
6148643 6151937 I want to be able to bill him<br />as the Black Hercules.
6153648 6157360 -The Black Hercules. Isn't that clever?<br />-More like Nigger-les.
6158819 6160988 I said, and I quote:
6161322 6164617 "I would pay top dollar for...
6164784 6167370 ...the right nigger."
6167745 6171749 Now, I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe<br />is the wrong nigger, per se.
6172041 6175168 But is he right as rain?
6175920 6181050 Oh, Dr. Schultz, I will have you know<br />there is no one in the nigger fight game...
6181217 6183678 ...that appreciates<br />the value of showmanship...
6183844 6186389 -...more than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie.<br />-Nobody.
6186555 6190434 But one must not forget the most<br />important thing in the nigger fight game.
6190601 6192728 And that is a nigger<br />that can win fights.
6193813 6198025 Now, that should be your first, second,<br />third, fourth and fifth concern.
6198191 6200778 After you have that,<br />and you know you have that...
6200945 6204073 ...then you can start to implement<br />a grand design.
6204448 6207159 In other words, first thing is first.
6207326 6208744 First things first.
6217837 6219922 I see you two getting on.
6220548 6222091 Famously.
6222800 6223968 Oh, Monsieur Candie...
6224135 6228597 ...you cannot imagine what it's like not to<br />hear your native tongue in four years.
6228764 6231726 Well, hell, I can't imagine<br />two weeks in Boston.
6233310 6237565 Two weeks in Boston.<br />Monsieur Candie, you a mess.
6238274 6240192 Two weeks in Boston.
6240359 6245489 I can't express the joy I felt<br />conversing in my mother tongue.
6245656 6249869 And Hildi is a charming<br />conversation companion.
6250035 6251871 Well, be careful now, Dr. Schultz.
6252037 6254790 You might have caught<br />a little dose of nigger love.
6255166 6257250 Nigger love's a powerful emotion, boy.
6257418 6261130 It's like a pool of black tar.<br />Once it catches your ass, you caught.
6261297 6263299 Yes, sir, you stuck.
6264300 6265843 I don't know, doctor.
6266010 6268971 You can lay on all<br />the German sweet talk you want...
6269138 6273184 ...but it looks like this pony's<br />got big eyes for Django.
6275227 6277855 Well, naturally.
6278022 6281442 It is the soaring eagle<br />that attracts her attention...
6281609 6283778 ...not the plucked chicken.
6284695 6286864 Dr. Schultz,<br />don't be so down on yourself.
6287031 6289325 You are quite the dapper<br />European gentleman.
6289492 6292870 To clean these dishes, put your elbow<br />in these dishes, you hear?
6293037 6295498 You know that nigger, don't you?
6295998 6297290 -Who?<br />-"Who?"
6297458 6300753 Don't "who" me, bitch.<br />You know who I'm talking about.
6302254 6304048 At the table?
6304297 6305883 I don't know him.
6306050 6307468 You don't know him.
6307635 6310346 -No.<br />-"No," what?
6310638 6312264 No, sir.
6316519 6319063 You wouldn't lie to me, now,<br />would you?
6323234 6324735 Okay.
6325778 6329365 Yeah. If you say so.
6334912 6338958 Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,<br />no doubt about it.
6340000 6342002 But if it was my money...
6342962 6345297 ...I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.
6345464 6347633 What would your price be?
6347800 6349927 Well, if I was inclined<br />to be generous...
6350094 6353806 ...and I don't know why I would be<br />inclined to be generous...
6354390 6356183 ...9000.
6356600 6357643 Maybe.
6358769 6359812 Dr. Schultz...
6360771 6364775 ...let me reclarify how this<br />whole negotiation came about.
6364942 6367319 It wasn't me who came to you<br />to sell a nigger.
6367486 6368529 Sure wasn't.
6368696 6370990 -You approached me to buy one.<br />-Sure was.
6371156 6373576 That $9000 Bright Boy's<br />been bandying about...
6373742 6377079 ...ain't too far off. If I wanted<br />to sell Eskimo Joe for that...
6377246 6379957 -...I could do so any day of the week.<br />-Any day.
6380124 6384461 But like you said in Greenville, doctor,<br />I don't wanna sell him.
6384795 6388966 It was only your ridiculous offer<br />of $12,000...
6389133 6391802 ...that made me even consider it.
6400144 6404273 You know, Monsieur Candie, you do<br />possess the power of persuasion.
6408569 6410738 Why not?<br />Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.
6410905 6413032 Eskimo Joe, $12,000.
6413198 6416285 Hooray, doctor. Hooray.<br />And a wise decision that is.
6416452 6420122 However, that is a tremendous<br />amount of money.
6420289 6423334 And the way you have your Mr. Moguy,<br />I have a lawyer.
6423500 6425294 Persnickety man named Tuttle.
6425461 6428631 And I would need my Mr. Tuttle<br />to draw up a legal contract...
6428797 6432676 ...before I'd feel comfortable exchanging<br />that amount of money for flesh.
6432843 6436639 Not to mention having Eskimo Joe<br />examined by a physician of my choosing.
6436805 6442435 -Naturally.<br />-So, say I return in about...
6444563 6445731 ...five days' time.
6445898 6447024 Five days?
6447191 6448441 With my Mr. Tuttle.
6448609 6450903 And then my Mr. Tuttle<br />and your Mr. Moguy...
6451070 6453822 ...can hash out the finer details<br />between themselves.
6454573 6457493 I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.
6458243 6459495 Gentlemen...
6460537 6462915 ...may I propose a toast?
6464792 6466418 To Eskimo Joe.
6466585 6470589 Or shall we call him<br />the Black Hercules?
6470756 6472675 To the Black Hercules.
6472841 6474426 The Black Hercules.
6474593 6475803 To the Black Hercules.
6475970 6479472 You was right, doctor.<br />That name do have "pan-ass."
6481558 6484979 Hildi, top my drink off.
6487773 6492444 So, Hildi, how you like serving<br />at the big table in the Big House, huh?
6492903 6496115 When Monsieur Candie talk to you,<br />you answers.
6496281 6498450 I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
6499243 6502371 Better than sizzling in that hot box<br />or dragging your ass...
6502538 6503664 ...through a bramble bush.
6503831 6507626 Maybe not as much fun as getting to<br />pleasure all them Mandingos, huh?
6507793 6510170 -She like them niggers. Sure do.<br />-Like Samson?
6510337 6511380 No, sir.
6511547 6513090 You know, Monsieur Candie...
6513257 6516969 ...the doctor here might be interested<br />in seeing Hildi's peeled back...
6517136 6520513 ...seeing as how they don't have<br />many niggers where he come from.
6520681 6523017 Dr. Schultz,<br />when you was alone with Hildi...
6523183 6526395 ...did you just speak German<br />or did you take her clothes off?
6526562 6530107 -No, we just talked and--<br />-Oh, so you haven't seen her back?
6530274 6531316 I haven't--
6531483 6534653 No, no, no. Stephen's right,<br />you might find this interesting.
6534820 6536238 Hildi, take off your dress.
6536405 6538407 Show Dr. Schultz your back here.<br />Go on.
6538574 6542244 Calvin, I just got her all dressed up<br />and looking nice.
6542411 6545372 But, Lara Lee,<br />Dr. Schultz is from Düsseldorf.
6545538 6548375 They don't got niggers there.<br />He is a man of medicine.
6548541 6551462 It would fascinate him,<br />the niggers' endurance for pain.
6551628 6554965 These niggers are tough, Dr. Schultz,<br />no doubt about it.
6555132 6557176 Hildi's got something like four lashes.
6557342 6560012 Lara Lee just get one,<br />she'd lose her goddamn mind.
6560179 6563474 -Look at that, doctor. It's like a painting.<br />-Calvin!
6564224 6567560 We are eating. Ain't no one<br />wanna look at her whipped-up back.
6569188 6571273 Fine. Fine, fine, fine.
6571523 6574567 After dinner, then, Stephen.<br />After dinner.
6575235 6577237 During the brandies, gentlemen.
6583243 6585412 Cora, come get this girl.
6588332 6591293 -She a mess.<br />-Yes, ma'am?
6591668 6595839 Why are you all undone?<br />I just got you done up. Come on in here.
6602054 6605974 Baby, you on Stephen bad side,<br />and you need to be on his blind side.
6606141 6608644 You say you ain't know him.
6610437 6616276 I said, you said you ain't know him.
6617319 6618821 I don't.
6619363 6620948 Yes, you do.
6622866 6624118 Mr. Stephen...
6625452 6626578 ...I don't.
6626870 6629540 Why is you lying to me?
6631500 6632918 I ain't.
6633252 6635504 Then why is you crying?
6636088 6637923 You scaring me.
6638132 6639341 Why is I'm scaring you?
6640134 6642010 Because you scary.
6643554 6646223 To speak German this afternoon<br />with Hildi...
6646390 6650060 ...was positively soul-enriching.
6650269 6652938 Doctor, that warms my heart<br />to hear that.
6653105 6656358 You stay right here.
6661488 6666034 You indicated earlier<br />you'd be willing to part with Hildi.
6666201 6669288 Why, yes. Yes, sirree, Bob, I did.
6670914 6672791 In that case...
6672958 6676962 ...allow me to propose<br />another proposition.
6677129 6678255 I'm all ears.
6678422 6680507 Hurry up, goddamn it!
6680883 6682426 -Monsieur Candie--<br />-Stephen.
6683510 6686388 You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.
6687222 6692060 I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.<br />My ears ain't worth a damn these days.
6692227 6693353 Excuse him.
6693520 6697024 Monsieur Candie, could I get<br />a word with you in the kitchen?
6697608 6699484 You mean get up out of my chair?
6699651 6701653 If'n you could manage it.
6701820 6704823 -Why?<br />-It's about dessert.
6704990 6706783 What about dessert?
6706950 6709536 I'd rather discuss that in private.
6709702 6711872 We're having white cake.
6712039 6714374 What sort of melodrama<br />could be brewing?
6714541 6718879 You right, Monsieur Candie.<br />You right. I'll handle it myself.
6719046 6720380 Meet me in the library.
6720547 6723926 I just can't understand<br />why you won't come talk to these niggers.
6724092 6726428 Shit get fucked up around here,<br />you blame me.
6726595 6731225 Fine, fine. Friend Stephen,<br />I will be along momentarily.
6731391 6732893 Yes, sir.
6733435 6736855 Well, gentlemen, as you can see...
6737022 6739191 ...talented as they are in the kitchen...
6739358 6742945 ...from time to time,<br />adult supervision is required.
6745781 6748075 If you'll excuse me a moment....
6753664 6755707 You may clear the dinner service.
6756959 6758919 You heard him. Go on, get.
6759795 6760837 Hurry up, girl.
6761004 6766093 So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you<br />regale us with a tale of the circus?
6766260 6768929 -The circus?<br />-Yes.
6775310 6777312 What is the matter?
6782401 6787489 Them motherfuckers ain't here<br />to buy no Mandingos.
6787656 6789199 They wants that girl.
6791285 6793996 Stephen, what the hell<br />are you talking about?
6794162 6797499 They playing your ass for a fool<br />is what I'm talking about.
6797833 6801336 They ain't here<br />for no muscle-bound Jimmie.
6801920 6804006 They here for that girl.
6804381 6806466 What girl? What, Hildi?
6806633 6810262 Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,<br />them niggers know each other.
6811930 6813515 He just bought Eskimo Joe.
6813682 6816143 -Did he give you any money?<br />-No, not yet, but--
6816310 6818687 Then he ain't bought diddly.<br />Not yet, no how.
6818854 6821148 But he's just about to buy...
6821315 6824443 ...who he come here to buy<br />when I interrupted him.
6824609 6828238 "Thank you, Stephen."<br />You're welcome, Calvin.
6832951 6835495 Where you getting all this?
6836163 6839958 Why would they go through all that<br />for a nigger with a chewed-up back...
6840125 6841251 ...ain't worth $300?
6841418 6845047 They doing it because that nigger<br />Django's in love with Hildi.
6845213 6846381 She probably his wife.
6847215 6851303 Why that German gives a fuck who<br />that uppity son of a bitch is in love with...
6851470 6853638 ...I'm sure I don't know.
6856016 6858060 If she's who they want...
6858393 6862689 ...why this whole snake oil pitch<br />about Mandingos then?
6862855 6866401 You wouldn't pay no never mind<br />to no $300.
6866610 6868904 But that 12,000?
6869488 6872407 That made you real friendly,<br />now, didn't it?
6874659 6876870 Yes, it did.
6879706 6881708 His wife, huh?
6885253 6889549 If it had been a snake,<br />it would have bit me.
6892302 6894888 Those lying...
6895180 6898517 ...goddamn time-wasting...
6898683 6901561 ...sons of bitches.
6903188 6904564 Sons of bitches!
6904731 6910570 --out of New Orleans, so I have quite<br />a bit of practice with theater types.
6911154 6912572 Oh, there you are.
6912739 6916410 I was beginning to think that you<br />and that old crow run off together.
6917411 6919663 That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?
6920122 6922749 Lara Lee, I was just looking<br />out the big window.
6922916 6925919 Billy Crash is out there<br />dealing with some shady slaver...
6926086 6931133 ...trying to sell a passel of ponies.<br />Be a dear, go give them gals an eyeball.
6931425 6934219 -Of course, brother.<br />-Thank you, darling.
6947023 6950485 Yeah. Business never sleeps.
6952571 6955449 Apropos, before your exit...
6955615 6959911 ...we were discussing the possibility<br />of my purchasing Broomhilda.
6960078 6962914 Yes. Yes, we were, doctor.
6963081 6965250 And we will again, in a moment.
6981516 6983935 Who's your little friend?
6988732 6990525 This is Ben.
6991568 6996490 He's a old Joe that lived around here<br />for a long time.
6996740 6999201 And I do mean a long damn time.
7000327 7004456 Old Ben here took care of my daddy...
7004748 7006917 ...and my daddy's daddy.
7007083 7009920 Till he up and keeled over one day...
7012464 7014716 ...Old Ben took care of me.
7016593 7020680 Growing up the son of a huge<br />plantation owner in Mississippi...
7020847 7022682 ...puts a white man in contact...
7022849 7026520 ...with a whole lot of black faces.
7028271 7033693 I spent my whole life here,<br />right here in Candyland...
7034861 7038615 ...surrounded by black faces.
7040617 7044079 Now, seeing them every day,<br />day in, day out...
7044246 7046706 ...I only had one question:
7049918 7051294 Why don't they kill us?
7055507 7060595 Now, right out there on that porch,<br />three times a week for 50 years...
7060762 7065767 ...Old Ben here would shave my daddy<br />with a straight razor.
7066142 7071064 Now, if I was Old Ben, I would have<br />cut my daddy's goddamn throat...
7071231 7075110 ...and it wouldn't have taken me<br />no 50 years to do it, neither.
7077195 7079114 But he never did.
7080615 7081741 Why not?
7083243 7087664 You see, the science of phrenology...
7088206 7090375 ...is crucial to understanding...
7090542 7093795 ...the separation of our two species.
7095130 7098091 In the skull of the African here...
7098883 7101428 ...the area associated<br />with submissiveness...
7101595 7107392 ...is larger than any human or any other<br />subhuman species on planet Earth.
7122324 7124534 If you examine...
7125577 7128330 ...this piece of skull here...
7134044 7137631 ...you will notice three distinct dimples.
7141176 7145055 Here, here and here.
7145221 7146431 Now...
7146598 7151478 ...if I was holding the skull<br />of an Isaac Newton or Galileo...
7151645 7156066 ...these three dimples would be found<br />in the area most associated with...
7156232 7158026 ...creativity.
7158193 7160695 But this is the skull of Old Ben.
7160945 7162822 And in the skull of Old Ben...
7162989 7165283 ...unburdened by genius...
7165450 7170288 ...these three dimples exist in the area<br />of the skull most associated with...
7170747 7172457 ...servility.
7173291 7175293 Now, Bright Boy...
7175752 7178129 ...I will admit you are pretty clever.
7180465 7183176 But if I took this hammer here...
7184719 7187639 ...and I bashed in your skull with it...
7188098 7193895 ...you would have the same<br />three dimples in the same place...
7194646 7196189 ...as Old Ben.
7197315 7200777 Hey! Now lay your palms<br />flat on that tabletop!
7200944 7203947 If you lift those palms<br />off that turtle shell tabletop...
7204114 7207701 ...Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose<br />with both barrels of that sawed-off.
7208535 7211913 There have been a lot of lies<br />around this dinner table tonight...
7212080 7214207 ...but that you can believe!
7214374 7219838 Mr. Moguy, would you collect the pistol<br />hanging off these boys' hips here?
7224259 7227470 -Thank you ever so much.<br />-Doctor.
7231307 7233184 Where were we?
7237147 7239107 Jackass.
7242444 7244070 Yes.
7244237 7247782 I do believe you were just getting ready<br />to make me a proposition...
7247949 7249617 ...to buy Broomhilda.
7249784 7251411 Am I right?
7255206 7256791 Right.
7258626 7259669 Bring out Hildi!
7263339 7265216 Get over there yonder.
7266092 7268470 Sit your ass in that goddamn chair!
7268636 7272140 -Lay your hand flat on that tabletop.<br />-Now shut your mouth.
7275894 7277145 Dr. Schultz...
7277312 7281191 ...in Greenville, you yourself said<br />that for the right nigger...
7281357 7285862 ...you'd be willing to pay what some<br />may consider is a ridiculous amount.
7286029 7289407 To which me myself said,<br />"What is your definition of ridiculous?"
7289574 7293745 To which you said, "$12,000."
7294037 7297707 Now, considering y'all have ridden<br />a whole lot of miles...
7297874 7300043 ...went through a whole lot of trouble...
7300210 7304506 ...and done spread a whole lot of bull<br />to purchase this lovely lady right here...
7304672 7310678 ...it would appear that Broomhilda is,<br />in fact, the right nigger.
7310929 7314641 And if y'all want to leave Candyland<br />with Broomhilda...
7314849 7320355 ...the price is $12,000.
7320522 7324317 And I take it you prefer the "take it<br />or leave it" style of negotiation?
7326569 7328780 Yes, I do, doctor.
7328947 7331866 You see, under the laws<br />of Chickasaw County...
7332033 7335537 ...Broomhilda here is my property.
7335703 7340959 And I can choose to do with my property<br />whatever I so desire.
7342085 7344921 And if y'all think my price...
7345088 7348675 ...for this nigger here is too steep...
7348842 7351719 ...what I'm gonna desire to do is...
7355056 7358560 ...take this goddamn hammer here<br />and beat her ass to death with it!
7358726 7360228 Right in front of both y'all!
7360395 7361521 Easy, big fella.
7361688 7365483 Then we can examine the three dimples<br />inside Broomhilda's skull!
7365650 7369153 Now, what's it gonna be, doc?
7370280 7371489 What's it gonna be?
7371656 7375618 May I lift the hands off the tabletop<br />in order to remove my billfold?
7376494 7378329 Yes, you may.
7391509 7392802 That 12.
7396806 7398766 Sold!
7398975 7405440 To the man with the exceptional beard<br />and his unexceptional nigger.
7410695 7413197 -Mr. Moguy.<br />-Yes, Calvin?
7413740 7416993 Will you make these gentlemen<br />a receipt for $12,000, please?
7417160 7419579 Twelve thousand dollars.
7421998 7424834 It was a pleasure doing business<br />with y'all.
7425001 7426711 Now, gentlemen...
7427837 7430340 ...if you care to join me in the parlor...
7430882 7433801 ...we will be serving white cake.
7521514 7523433 Well done, Calvin.
7525393 7526728 Excuse me.
7526894 7528396 Excuse me, ma'am.
7529647 7531816 Could you please<br />stop playing Beethoven?
7532191 7534360 Take your hands off the harp.
7537655 7538865 Doctor.
7539323 7541909 -Doctor, you can't go in there.<br />-Stephen, Stephen.
7542076 7544829 -He ain't got no business going in there.<br />-Let it be.
7544996 7548499 He's just a little upset, that's all.<br />I'll handle this.
7574025 7575234 White cake?
7576194 7578821 I don't go in for sweets, thank you.
7588331 7591626 You brooding about me<br />getting the best of you, huh?
7591834 7596756 Actually, I was thinking of that<br />poor devil you fed to the dogs today.
7596923 7599008 D'Artagnan.
7599509 7603054 And I was wondering what Dumas<br />would make of all this.
7603471 7604806 Come again?
7608059 7612105 Alexandre Dumas.<br />He wrote <i>The Three Musketeers.</i>
7612271 7613815 Yes, of course, doctor.
7613981 7615733 I figured you must be an admirer.
7615900 7620196 You named your slave<br />after his novel's lead character.
7620404 7623783 Now, if Alexandre Dumas<br />had been there today...
7623950 7626119 ...I wonder what he would have<br />made of it.
7628329 7629997 You doubt he'd approve, huh?
7632208 7637380 Yes. His approval would be<br />a dubious proposition at best.
7639715 7641884 Soft-hearted Frenchie.
7643386 7645763 Alexandre Dumas is black.
7649392 7652270 -Are these Broomhilda's papers?<br />-Yes, they are.
7652436 7654105 -May I?<br />-Of course.
7654272 7655731 Thank you.
7657817 7660528 That is her bill of sale,<br />her ownership history...
7660695 7663072 ...and of course,<br />her freedom papers, doctor.
7663239 7665366 Would you have ink and pen for me?
7666617 7669954 -Right over there on that little table.<br />-Thank you.
7691017 7692101 Thank you.
7695688 7698399 Broomhilda Von Shaft...
7700109 7702820 ...consider yourself a free woman.
7714498 7716751 Mr. Candie...
7718294 7722173 ...normally, I would say<br />auf Wiedersehen.
7722340 7726969 But since what auf Wiedersehen<br />actually means is "till I see you again"...
7727136 7731015 ...and since I never wish<br />to see you again, to you, sir...
7731182 7734518 ...I say, "goodbye."
7738022 7739482 Let's go.
7740608 7742026 Come on.
7743861 7745696 One more moment, doctor.
7747573 7748616 What?
7753329 7755873 It's a custom here in the South...
7756040 7761837 ...once a business deal is concluded<br />that the two parties shake hands.
7762255 7765424 -It implies good faith.<br />-I'm not from the South.
7765591 7767301 But you are...
7767677 7770012 ...in my house, doctor.
7770763 7772473 So I'm afraid I must insist.
7772640 7773683 Insist?
7773849 7775977 On what? That I shake your hand?
7776143 7779313 Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist<br />in the opposite direction.
7779981 7784902 -You know what I think you are?<br />-What you think I am? No, I don't.
7786362 7788364 I think you are a bad loser.
7788864 7791951 And I think you're an abysmal winner.
7792118 7793327 Nevertheless...
7793953 7797123 ...here in Chickasaw County,<br />a deal ain't done...
7797290 7799667 ...until the two parties<br />have shook hands.
7800376 7804046 Even after all that paper signing,<br />don't mean shit...
7804380 7807967 ...you don't shake my hand.
7808718 7814598 If I don't shake your hand,<br />you're gonna throw away $12,000?
7814765 7816434 I don't think so.
7817560 7818602 Mr. Pooch?
7820604 7825234 If she tries to leave here before this<br />nigger-loving German shakes my hand...
7825401 7827069 ...you cut her ass down.
7849050 7852386 You really want me<br />to shake your hand?
7854013 7855681 I insist.
7856891 7859268 If you insist.
7876077 7878996 No! Calvin!
7880206 7881791 Calvin!
7888005 7890549 I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.
7902937 7905064 Nigger's gone crazy! Help!
7905231 7907775 Help, he's killing everyone!
7923833 7925793 -Holy--!<br />-Shit!
7925960 7927002 -Son of a--!<br />-Bitch!
7931632 7932967 -Damn it!<br />-Fucking--!
7933300 7934427 Get the fuck--!
7937471 7939473 Damn it, son of a bitch! What--?
7940266 7941559 Fucking nigger!
7941725 7942893 Damn it!
7943769 7946063 What the fuck is going on?
7946689 7948190 You shot me!
7948357 7949859 You stupid son of a--!
7950025 7951444 Sorry, Jessie!
7951610 7955698 Who the fuck gave a nigger<br />a goddamn gun?
7985644 7986812 Aim low!
7989773 7991233 Nigger! Gonna kill!
7992526 7994195 God! Oh, my God!
7995321 7997031 Motherfucker!
8005080 8006540 Shit!
8063264 8064390 Shit.
8076569 8078028 Hold your fire!
8081407 8083242 Hold your fire!
8084827 8086579 Stop shooting, goddamn it!
8095296 8096839 Django!
8097172 8098215 What?
8101302 8103137 We got your woman.
8104388 8107725 Billy Crash here got his pistol<br />upside her head.
8107891 8112980 You don't stop all that carrying on,<br />he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.
8113147 8115190 Now, that ain't no threat, horse boy.
8115524 8117026 That there is a promise.
8118485 8119903 Or...
8120070 8122990 ...you can give up,<br />throw your gun out...
8123991 8125326 ...we won't kill Hildi.
8125492 8126869 Horseshit!
8127036 8130456 Honest Injun, Django.<br />I swear 'fore God.
8131206 8132875 You give up...
8133167 8136295 ...ain't no harm gonna come to her.
8137338 8139590 And I'm supposed to believe<br />your black ass?
8139757 8142760 I don't give a goddamn<br />what you believe or don't believe!
8142926 8145888 I believe if you don't give up<br />in the next 10 seconds...
8146055 8149892 ...we gonna blow this bitch's brains out!<br />Believe that!
8152269 8153687 Don't do it.
8154229 8155773 You give me up.
8156190 8158025 -Six!<br />-Just let me go.
8158192 8159610 -Seven!<br />-They got too much.
8159777 8161320 -Django.<br />-Eight!
8161487 8162529 I love you.
8162905 8163947 Nine!
8164114 8165157 Hold it!
8165324 8166367 No.
8168243 8169370 I give up.
8170537 8173290 I can't hear you, nigger.
8173540 8176001 I said I give up.
8199942 8202903 No.
8203070 8204571 No.
8295954 8298332 Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.
8303295 8305881 So y'all bounty hunters, huh?
8306465 8309593 I knew there was something fishy<br />about y'all.
8310177 8312721 We found your wanted posters...
8312888 8315724 ...and book of figures<br />in your saddlebags.
8316683 8318685 I got to say...
8319228 8322439 ...I ain't never heard of no<br />black bounty hunter before.
8322606 8326443 Black boy paid to kill white men?<br />How'd you like that line of work?
8326610 8329404 Probably pretty good<br />while it lasted, huh?
8338789 8342209 Time to say good night<br />to them nuts, blackie. On three.
8342751 8344044 One.
8344878 8346505 I got you. Two.
8347965 8349883 Calm down. Now here it comes.
8350968 8352386 Captain?
8352636 8354429 Miss Lara want to see you.
8355138 8359101 Something to do<br />with the Old Man's funeral.
8359476 8363230 Oh, and she changed her mind<br />about snipping Django.
8364064 8366900 She gonna give him<br />to the LeQuint Dickey people.
8368652 8370863 Well, she didn't waste a minute<br />telling me.
8377953 8380289 How disappointing.
8402811 8404563 You leaving.
8405898 8409484 This here what you take with you.
8412279 8415824 Your black ass has been all them<br />motherfuckers at the Big House...
8415991 8419286 ...could talk about<br />for the last few hours.
8419453 8422956 Seem like white folk ain't never<br />had a bright idea in they life...
8423123 8426126 ...was coming up with all kinds<br />of ways to kill your ass.
8426293 8431506 Now, mind you, most of them ideas<br />had to do with fucking with your fun parts.
8431673 8435385 Now, that may seem like a good idea...
8435552 8437638 ...but truth is...
8438722 8441224 ...when you snip a nigger's nuts...
8441391 8445520 ...most of them bleed out in,<br />oh, about seven minutes.
8445687 8447356 Most of them.
8449066 8451026 More than most.
8451193 8452945 Then I says:
8454446 8456657 "Shitfire.
8457240 8461787 The niggers we sells to LeQuint Dickey<br />got it worse than that."
8462245 8464957 And they still saying,<br />"Let's whip him to death."
8465123 8468585 Or "Throw him to the Mandingos."<br />"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."
8468752 8472047 And I said,<br />"What's so special about that?
8472214 8474132 We do that shit all the time.
8474299 8475342 Hell's bells...
8475509 8480430 ...the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey<br />got it worse than that."
8481348 8484184 Lo and behold...
8484351 8488939 ...out of nowhere, Miss Lara<br />come up with the bright idea...
8489147 8492859 ...of giving your ass to<br />the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
8495237 8499866 And as a slave of<br />the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company...
8500325 8503870 ...henceforth, till the day you die...
8504079 8507124 ...all day, every day...
8507290 8510168 ...you will be swinging<br />a sledgehammer...
8510335 8514840 ...turning big rocks into little rocks.
8515424 8516925 Now, when you get there...
8517092 8519678 ...they gonna take away your name...
8519845 8522973 ...give you a number<br />and a sledgehammer...
8523140 8525350 ...and say, "Get to work."
8525517 8528061 And one word of sass,<br />they cuts out your tongue.
8528228 8530689 And they good at it too.<br />You won't bleed out.
8530856 8534276 Oh, they does that real good.
8534443 8536028 They gonna work you...
8536194 8541199 ...all day, every day,<br />till your back give out.
8541408 8544244 Then they're gonna hit you in the head<br />with a hammer...
8544411 8546496 ...throw your ass down the nigger hole.
8546663 8552544 And that will be the story<br />of you, Django.
8590749 8592834 And what's the golden rule,<br />Frankie, eh?
8593627 8596129 You don't root abos.
8600801 8602302 Hey, white boy.
8603762 8605722 I said, hey, white boy.
8606139 8609226 Shut up, black. You ain't got<br />nothing to say I wanna hear.
8609392 8611645 How'd you like to make $11,000?
8611812 8612896 Do what, now?
8613063 8616608 I said how'd you like to make $11,000?
8616942 8621113 -Eleven thousand, 500, actually.<br />-What the fuck are you talking about?
8621279 8625992 Back there at that plantation, Candyland,<br />there was an $11,500 fortune.
8626159 8628829 Just sitting there.<br />And y'all rode right past it.
8629412 8631581 You be damned, blackie,<br />we're not bandits.
8631748 8636002 I ain't saying that. Nice thing<br />about this fortune is it ain't illegal.
8636169 8639297 You can't steal it.<br />You got to earn it, white boy.
8640298 8642509 You got something to say, mate,<br />you say it.
8642676 8645595 The $11,500 fortune waiting for you<br />back at Candyland...
8645762 8648598 ...is in the form of<br />a "wanted dead or alive" bounty...
8648765 8652602 -...on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.<br />-Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?
8652769 8657399 Smitty Bacall is the leader of this gang<br />of stagecoach robbers, the Bacall Gang.
8657566 8660777 There's a $7000 "wanted dead or alive"<br />bounty on him...
8660944 8663530 ...$1500 for each of his three<br />accomplices:
8664406 8665907 Dandy Michaels...
8666283 8670370 ...Gerald Nash and Crazy Craig Koons.
8670579 8672080 All four of them gentlemen...
8672247 8675876 ...they back there at Candyland<br />laughing their ass off. You know why?
8676042 8679880 Because they just got away with murder.<br />But it ain't got to be that way.
8680046 8683508 You and your mates, y'all can<br />ride back there and get that money.
8683675 8688221 -What'd these jokers do again?<br />-Sons of bitches killed innocent people.
8688430 8691600 Stagecoach robbery.<br />Innocent white people.
8692726 8696104 I got the handbill right here<br />in my pocket, if you let me get it.
8696271 8697606 Get it out.
8699065 8701985 "Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall...
8702152 8704905 -...and the Smitty Bacall Gang.<br />-But you're a slave.
8705071 8708283 -Murder and stagecoach robbery."<br />-I ain't no goddamn slave.
8708450 8710118 Do I sound like a fucking slave?
8710285 8712746 -"$7000 for Smitty Bacall."<br />-That's a shitload.
8712913 8714581 I'm a bounty hunter.
8715749 8718460 Yesterday, as a free man...
8718627 8723256 ...I rode into Candyland on a horse<br />with my German white partner...
8723423 8724966 ...Dr. King Schultz.
8725133 8729930 We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way<br />from Texas to Chickasaw County.
8730096 8732891 We finally found their ass<br />laying low in Candyland.
8733058 8736478 We went in there to get them,<br />things went sour...
8736645 8740023 ...my partner got killed,<br />Calvin Candie got shot...
8740190 8742817 ...then everybody there<br />decided to blame me...
8742984 8744611 ...so here I am.
8746279 8748406 But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.
8748573 8751409 And all y'all know<br />I ain't supposed to be on this trip.
8751576 8754829 But them four men is still back there,<br />they're still wanted...
8754996 8756831 ...and that 11,500 is up for grabs.
8756998 8760877 The last thing they'd expect<br />is y'all riding back in there and getting it.
8761044 8762671 Well, what's the deal?
8762837 8766341 You tell us who they are<br />and we turn you loose?
8766508 8769219 No, no, no.<br />I ain't gonna tell you who they are.
8769427 8772806 But you give me a pistol,<br />one of them horses...
8772973 8777644 ...and $500 of that 11,500,<br />and I'll point them out to you.
8777811 8779145 <i>This is a real handbill.</i>
8779312 8783483 Just because it's a real handbill doesn't<br />mean that other bunch of malarkey is.
8783650 8785443 Now, why would a slave...
8785610 8789322 ...have a "wanted dead or alive"<br />handbill in his pocket?
8793827 8796705 Did that black ride into Candyland<br />yesterday?
8803044 8807340 All right, I'm gonna ask you again.
8808216 8811344 I want you to remember,<br />I don't like liars.
8811553 8813263 Is he a Candyland slave...
8813430 8817267 ...or did he ride in with a white man<br />on a horse yesterday?
8817434 8819102 Yeah.
8819436 8821771 They walked us<br />from the Greenville auction...
8821938 8824524 ...and he rode in on a horse<br />with a white man.
8824691 8828820 Now, this white man,<br />was the black his slave?
8828987 8830530 He weren't no slave.
8830697 8832741 You fucking sure about that?
8832907 8834409 Damn sure.
8838371 8840290 What happened over in Candyland?
8840457 8843835 Bunch of shooting. Master got shot.
8844002 8846046 -Who shot him?<br />-The German.
8846212 8847464 Why'd he do that?
8847922 8851718 Nigger and the German was acting<br />like they were slavers but they wasn't.
8851885 8854721 -Well, what were they?<br />-Bounty hunters.
8855930 8859184 Fuck me, Roy.<br />I mean, this could be big, mate.
8860143 8863396 Well, smoke, you got a deal.
8864981 8866775 I got one more condition.
8866941 8867984 What's that?
8868151 8871196 When we get there, when time come...
8873156 8875867 -...you let me help you kill them.<br />-Hey.
8876242 8877827 You're a funny bugger.
8877994 8880580 -Cut him loose.<br />-Yeah, yeah.
8880789 8882707 You got yourself a deal, blackie.
8882874 8884626 You got yourself a deal, mate.
8884793 8886044 Hey.

8894761 8896513 There we go. There you go, mate.
8896679 8898014 Yeah.
8898181 8900809 We're gonna give you<br />that packhorse over there.
8900975 8903853 -What them saddlebags got in them?<br />-Dynamite.
8904020 8907190 I ain't riding no horse<br />with no goddamn dynamite on its back.
8907357 8909067 I can understand that.
8909234 8912237 Frankie, why don't you take<br />them sticks off that horse...
8912404 8915073 ...and stick them in the nigger cage?
8915698 8918868 A little dynamite for you black fellas<br />to play with.
8929462 8932215 Floyd, you got that rifle<br />up on the wagon, don't you?
8932382 8933425 Yeah, right.
8933591 8936052 Why don't you give him your gun<br />and gun belt?
8936219 8937554 Righto.
8937720 8940723 Now, don't drop the fucking thing,<br />all right?
8940890 8943601 I just had the sights fixed<br />and they're perfect.
8943768 8945728 Oh, that's good to know.
9037654 9039239 Throw me up that dynamite.
9129787 9131372 -Jake.<br />-Yeah?

9136878 9138004 Get them.

9446812 9450274 ...I suggest you get away<br />from all these white folks.
