44850 48380 <i>Love will live on</i>

52257 58950 <i>For you cannot spend your life regretting</i>

67605 70623 <i>Django</i>
70624 74221 <i>Now your love has gone away</i>
74469 77983 <i>Once you loved her</i>
78191 81656 <i>Now you've lost her</i>
81972 88132 <i>But you've lost her forever, Django</i>

104174 107267 <i>Oh Django</i>

184620 188118 <i>You must go on</i>
234319 236863 Whoa.
243161 244329 Whoa.
258760 261971 Who's that stumblin'<br />around in the dark?
262138 265934 State your business<br />or prepare to get winged!
266100 268686 Calm yourselves, gentlemen.
268853 271189 I mean you no harm.
271356 276194 I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.<br />Whoa, boy.
277528 279197 Good cold evening, gentlemen.
279364 281699 I'm looking for a pair of slave traders
281866 283534 that go by the name<br />of the Speck Brothers.
283701 285536 Might that be you?
286913 289666 -Who wants to know?<br />-Well, I do.
289832 291709 I'm Dr. King Schultz.<br />This is my horse, Fritz.
292961 296464 -What kinda doctor?<br />-Dentist.
296631 298424 Now, are you the Speck Brothers?
298591 301386 And did you purchase those men<br />at the Greenville slave auction?
301552 304138 -So what?<br />-So I wish to parley with you.
304305 307642 -Speak English.<br />-Oh, I'm sorry.
307809 310019 Please forgive me.<br />It is a second language.
310186 313481 Now, amongst your inventory,<br />I've been led to believe,
313648 316067 is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.
316234 317694 Hello, you poor devils!
319028 321614 Is there one amongst you<br />who was formerly a resident
321781 325076 of the Carrucan plantation?
325827 328037 I'm from the Carrucan plantation.
329664 331040 Who said that?
378254 379630 What's your name?
383801 385678 Django.
385845 388598 Then you are exactly<br />the one I'm looking for.
390475 392685 Do you know who<br />the Brittle Brothers are?
396314 397315 Who are they?
399734 401360 Big John.
402153 403488 Ellis.
404906 408826 Roger.<br />Sometime they call him Lil Raj.
410203 412413 They was overseers<br />at the Carrucan plantation.
412580 413664 Not anymore.
416751 417794 Tell me...
418377 421172 if you were to see<br />any of these three gentlemen again,
421339 424008 -would you recognize them?<br />-Hey.
424175 426636 -Stop talkin' to him like that.<br />-Like what?
426803 428346 Like that.
428513 430807 My good man,<br />I'm simply trying to ascertain...
430973 433017 Speak English, goddamn it.
433184 434936 Everybody calm down.
435103 438815 I'm simply a customer<br />trying to conduct a transaction.
438981 441984 I don't care. No sale.<br />Now, off with ya.
442151 445154 Don't be ridiculous.<br />Of course they're for sale.
445988 447448 Move it.
447615 452537 My good man, did you simply get carried<br />away with your dramatic gesture
452703 456499 or are you pointing your weapon at me<br />with lethal intention?
457583 459460 Last chance, fancy pants.
460878 462714 Oh, very well.
491993 494412 I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,
494579 496497 but I didn't want you<br />to do anything rash
496664 498958 before you had a moment<br />to come to your senses.
499125 502545 You goddamn son of a bitch!
502712 505506 -You shot Roscoe!<br />-Well...
505673 507383 And you killed Ace!
507550 510219 I only shot your brother once<br />he threatened to shoot me.
510386 513222 And I do believe I have...<br />one, two, three, four...
513389 516350 five witnesses<br />who can attest to that fact.
516517 519395 -Damn leg's busted!<br />-No doubt.
519562 522106 Now, if you could keep your<br />caterwauling down to a minimum,
522273 525610 I'd like to finish my line<br />of inquiry with young Django.
529614 533075 -God-fuckin'-damn it!<br />-As I was saying...
533242 536954 if you were to see the Brittle<br />Brothers again, you could recognize 'em?
537622 539332 Yeah.
539498 540791 Sold American!
540958 544921 So, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck?<br />How much for young Django here?
550218 552845 That iron is nasty business.
558059 560186 Oh, could you hold this for a moment?
562313 563814 Thank you. Django?
563981 565858 Get up on that horse.
566025 567818 Also, if I were you,
567985 571989 I'd take that winter coat<br />the dear departed Speck left behind.
586128 590007 Nigger!<br />Don't you touch my brother's coat.
600685 605606 Goddamn it! Oh!
607275 612446 One hundred... ten... 20...
612613 614448 and five...
615700 616867 for young Django here.
617034 619203 And since he won't<br />be needing it anymore,
619370 621872 I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.
622581 627545 Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid<br />I will require a bill of sale.
627712 629297 Do you have one?
629463 632383 You go to hell, dentist.
632550 634552 I thought not.
634719 638222 No worries. I come prepared.
642560 644145 Thank you.
644312 647898 This will serve nicely<br />as a bill of sale.
660244 661245 Whoa.
665416 668878 Now, as to you poor devils.
669045 674091 So, as I see it, when it comes to<br />the subject of what to do next,
674258 677094 you gentlemen have two choices.
677261 682391 One: Once I'm gone, you could lift<br />that beast off the remaining Speck,
682558 684477 then carry him to the nearest town.
684643 688230 Which would be at least<br />37 miles back the way you came.
688397 694070 Or two: You could unshackle yourselves,<br />take that rifle,
694236 696781 put a bullet in his head,<br />bury the two of them deep,
696947 700493 and then make your way to a<br />more enlightened area of this country.
701577 702745 Choice is yours.
702912 707291 Oh, and on the off chance there are<br />any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
707458 710461 the North Star is that one.
711921 715091 Ta-ta.
729897 733984 Now wait a minute, fellas.<br />Let's talk about this!
737613 741033 You gotta be reasonable<br />in a situation like this!
742493 745496 I'm not a bad guy.<br />I'm just doin' my job!
745663 749250 Blueberry, didn't I<br />give you my last apple?
749417 752378 Tell you what, boys:<br />Take me to the doc in El Paso,
752545 754588 I'll get you your freedom.
754755 756509 No. No, please...
803846 805222 All right, now.
805389 807391 I'd like you to<br />take two of these tonight...
807558 809768 and then in the morning...
811896 813689 That's a nigger on a horse.
839298 841091 What's everybody staring at?
841258 843761 They ain't never seen<br />no nigger on a horse before.
856065 857066 Whoa.
867117 869119 Good morning, innkeeper!
870454 872915 Two beers for two weary travelers.
873082 874833 It's still a bit early.
875000 877419 We won't be open for another hour.
877586 879421 By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.
879588 885010 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what<br />the hell you think you're doing, boy?
885177 887263 Get that nigger outta here!
890808 894812 -Help! Help!<br />-Innkeeper!
894979 898148 Remember, get the sheriff,<br />not the marshal.
898315 900192 Sheriff! Help!
900359 901986 Alas.
903362 905906 Now we must act as our own bartender.
908325 910077 Sit down, my boy.
919753 922631 What kind of dentist are you?
923465 928053 Despite that cart, I haven't<br />practiced dentistry in five years.
932683 935978 But these days,<br />I practice a new profession...
938188 939565 bounty hunter.
946155 947990 Do you know what a bounty hunter is?
948699 949742 No.
949908 951118 Well...
952745 956874 the way the slave trade<br />deals in human lives for cash,
957041 959376 a bounty hunter deals in corpses.
960643 961754 Hat.
965507 967051 Prost.
975225 977895 The state places a bounty<br />on a man's head.
978062 980731 I track that man, I find that man,<br />I kill that man.
980898 984860 After I've killed him, I transport that<br />man's corpse back to the authorities.
985027 987738 Sometimes that's easier said than done.
987905 990699 I show that corpse to the authorities,<br />proving yes, indeed,
990866 992576 I truly have killed him,
992743 995746 at which point the authorities<br />pay me the bounty.
995913 999249 So, like slavery,<br />it's a flesh for cash business.
1000876 1001877 What's a bounty?
1005673 1007132 It's like a reward.
1007299 1010678 You kill people?<br />And they give you a reward?
1010844 1012721 Certain people, yeah.
1012888 1014014 Bad people?
1014181 1018143 Ah! Badder they are,<br />bigger the reward.
1018310 1020604 Which brings me to you.
1020771 1025025 And I must admit, I'm at a bit of<br />a quandary when it comes to you.
1025192 1027611 On one hand, I despise slavery.
1027778 1030906 On the other hand, I need your help.
1031073 1034451 If you're not in a position to refuse,<br />all the better.
1035327 1037996 So, for the time being, I'm gonna<br />make this slavery malarkey
1038163 1040374 work to my benefit.
1040541 1045212 Still, having said that, I feel guilty.
1046880 1052136 So, I would like the two of us<br />to enter into an agreement.
1059184 1061019 I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.
1065691 1067025 However, at this endeavor,
1067192 1072322 I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar<br />as I don't know what they look like.
1073574 1076452 But you do. Don't ya?
1076618 1078829 I know what they look like all right.
1078996 1082499 Good. So here's my agreement.
1082666 1086086 -You travel with me until we find them.<br />-Where we goin'?
1086253 1088881 I hear at least two of them<br />are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,
1089047 1091216 but I don't know where.
1091383 1095679 That means we visit every plantation<br />in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.
1095846 1101101 And when we find them,<br />you point them out, and I kill them.
1102144 1105522 You do that, I agree<br />to give you your freedom,
1105689 1109818 $25 per Brittle Brother,<br />$75.
1109985 1113697 And, as if on cue,<br />here comes the sheriff.
1121455 1126960 Okay, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.
1129588 1134176 All right, folks, calm down.
1135219 1136929 Go about your business.
1137721 1140098 These jokers will be gone soon.
1142059 1147481 Now, why y'all wanna come<br />into my town and start trouble?
1147648 1150901 And scare all these nice people.
1152069 1154738 You ain't got nothing better to do
1154905 1158116 than to come into Bill Sharp's town
1158283 1160536 and show your ass?
1168877 1172798 What'd you just do to our sheriff?
1184101 1186436 Now you can get the marshal.
1187938 1190274 Marshal! Marshal!
1190440 1192693 -Should we wait inside?<br />-Can we just leave?
1192860 1194069 After you.
1196530 1200742 Move that buckboard a long ways<br />across the street from the saloon.
1200909 1203787 I want six men, six rifles behind it.
1203954 1206123 I want two men,<br />two rifles up on this roof.
1206290 1208625 Two men, two rifles on that roof.
1208792 1211753 All the barrels aimed<br />at that front door.
1211920 1214923 Somebody get poor Bill<br />outta the goddamn street.
1216091 1218260 You in the saloon!
1218427 1221763 We got a hundred rifles aimed<br />at every way out of that buildin'.
1222472 1225642 You got one chance<br />to get out of this alive.
1226476 1229122 You and your nigger come out right now<br />with your hands over your head,
1229146 1231106 and I mean right now.
1232232 1235652 Is this the marshal<br />I have the pleasure of addressing?
1235819 1237613 Yes, it is.
1237779 1239865 This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.
1240032 1242326 <i>Na wunderbar</i>, marshal.
1242826 1246413 I have relieved myself of all weapons,
1246580 1249499 and just as you have instructed,
1249666 1252336 I am ready to step outside
1252502 1256590 with my hands raised above my head.
1257674 1260093 I trust as a representative
1260260 1263639 of the criminal justice system of<br />the United States of America,
1263805 1269645 I shan't be shot down in the street<br />by either you or your deputies
1269811 1272648 before I've had my day in court.
1272814 1275150 You mean like you did our sheriff.
1275317 1277110 Shot him down like a dog in the street.
1277277 1279613 Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
1279780 1285452 Do I have your word as a lawman not to<br />shoot me down like a dog in the street?
1288789 1292042 Well, much as we'd all enjoy<br />seeing something like that,
1292209 1295212 ain't nobody gonna cheat<br />the hangman in my town.
1296254 1299216 Fair enough, marshal.<br />Here we come.
1301051 1303220 They're a little tense out there.
1303387 1306848 So don't make any quick movements,<br />and let me do the talking.
1307182 1309851 Come ahead.
1316900 1318151 You unarmed?
1318318 1320028 Yes, indeed we are.
1320779 1324116 Marshal Tatum, may I address you<br />and your deputies,
1324282 1326243 and apparently the<br />entire town of Daughtrey,
1326410 1328745 as to the incident that just occurred?
1330080 1332541 -Go on.<br />-Thank you.
1332708 1334835 My name is Dr. King Schultz.
1335002 1338255 Like yourself, marshal,<br />I'm a servant of the court.
1338422 1341842 The man lying dead in the dirt,<br />who the good people of Daughtrey
1342009 1346096 saw fit to elect as their sheriff,<br />who went by the name of Bill Sharp,
1346263 1350851 is actually a wanted outlaw<br />by the name of Willard Peck,
1351018 1353603 with a price on his head of $200.
1353770 1356732 Now that's $200, dead or alive.
1356898 1358233 The hell, you say!
1358400 1362446 I'm aware this is probably<br />disconcerting news.
1362612 1365782 But I'm willing to wager<br />this man was elected sheriff
1365949 1368452 sometime in the past two years?
1369369 1370370 Yeah.
1370537 1373957 I know this because three<br />years ago, he was rustling cattle
1374124 1377586 from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company<br />of Lubbock, Texas.
1377753 1381548 Now, this is a warrant<br />made out by
1381715 1387387 Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen<br />Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.
1387554 1389264 You're encouraged to wire him.
1389431 1394478 He'll back up who I am and<br />who your dear departed sheriff was.
1402652 1406573 In other words, marshal,<br />you owe me $200.
1415248 1416603 I'll be damned.
1416604 1418186 <i>His name was King</i>
1419079 1421557 <i>He had a horse</i>
1421855 1426696 <i>Along the countryside<br />I saw him ride</i>
1426957 1429458 <i>He had a gun</i>
1429582 1431313 <i>I knew him well</i>
1431586 1434035 <i>Oh, I heard him singing</i>
1434125 1437173 <i>I knew he loved someone</i>
1444820 1448365 After this Brittle business<br />is behind us,
1448532 1454079 you'll be a free man, with a horse,<br />$75 in your back pocket...
1456873 1458291 What's your plan after that?
1460544 1464381 Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
1466633 1471513 Django, I had no idea<br />you were a married man.
1472013 1474307 Do most slaves believe in marriage?
1474474 1478061 Oh, me and my wife do.
1478228 1482399 Old Man Carrucan didn't.<br />That's why we, uh... we run off.
1483608 1485235 Django.
1485902 1488488 Django, Django.
1488655 1491366 You got sand, Django.
1492075 1493952 Boy's got sand.
1495745 1498874 I got no use for a nigger with sand.
1500584 1504087 I want you to burn a runaway "r"<br />right here on his cheek.
1504254 1505297 And the girl, too.
1507424 1512220 And I want you to take 'em to<br />the Greenville auction and sell 'em.
1513054 1514931 Both of 'em.
1515098 1516850 Separately.
1519311 1520645 And this one...
1523273 1525984 you will sell him cheap.
1527944 1529446 In Greenville...
1531990 1534951 there should be some sort<br />of a records office.
1542167 1544377 You know when she was sold...
1545837 1548798 you know where she came from,
1548965 1550800 and you know her name.
1551593 1553136 What is her name?
1553303 1554971 Broomhilda.
1556556 1559809 -What?<br />-Broom-hilda.
1559976 1561937 -<i>Brunhilde</i>?<br />-Hm-mm.
1564022 1567025 -Were her owners German?<br />-Yeah, how you know?
1567901 1569462 She wasn't born on<br />the Carrucan plantation.
1569486 1572030 She was raised by a German mistress,<br />the Von Shafts.
1572197 1574324 She speak a little German, too.
1574491 1576243 -Your wife?<br />-Hm-mm.
1576409 1578387 When she was little, her mistress<br />taught her so she'd have somebody
1578411 1579996 to speak German with.
1581581 1584167 Well, let me get this straight.
1584334 1588922 Your slave wife speaks German<br />and her name is <i>Brunhilde</i> Von Shaft?
1589089 1590215 Yep.
1594261 1597013 They call me Hildi.
1613697 1619286 When we gain access to these<br />plantations, we'll be putting on an act.
1620620 1623373 You'll be playing a character.
1630255 1631381 Hm?
1632090 1633508 No?
1640515 1644978 During the act, you can<br />never break character.
1646062 1647605 Do you understand?
1648356 1650900 Yeah. Don't break character.
1653236 1657157 And your character<br />is that of The Valet.
1657907 1659409 What that is?
1660327 1662704 That's a fancy word for servant.
1662871 1664122 -Valet?<br />-Hm-mm.
1665623 1670128 And now, Django, you may choose<br />your character's costume.
1672547 1674382 Youse gonna let me<br />pick out my own clothes?
1674549 1675549 But of course.
1679716 1682194 <i>His name was King</i>
1682195 1685357 <i>He had a horse<br />He had a brother</i>
1685358 1689808 <i>Along the countryside<br />I saw him ride</i>
1690069 1692570 <i>He had a gun</i>
1692694 1694425 <i>Oh, I knew him well</i>
1694698 1697147 <i>And when he shot</i>
1697978 1702240 <i>Oh that man, he never miss</i>
1702499 1704216 <i>Ride on King, ride</i>
1704287 1704823 Whoa.
1704824 1707545 <i>You get your man</i>
1709793 1713380 It's against the law for niggers<br />to ride horses in this territory.
1713546 1716925 This is my valet.<br />My valet does not walk.
1717092 1720970 -I said niggers on horses...<br />-His name is Django.
1721137 1723932 He's a free man.<br />He can ride what he pleases.
1724099 1727560 Not on my property.<br />Not around my niggers, he can't.
1728228 1733233 My good sir,<br />perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.
1733400 1735860 Allow me to unring this bell.
1736027 1739864 My name is Dr. King Schultz.<br />This is my valet, Django.
1740031 1742158 And these are our horses,<br />Tony and Fritz.
1745995 1747372 Mr. Bennett?
1747539 1751751 I've been led to believe that you<br />are a gentleman and a businessman.
1751918 1755880 And it is for these attributes<br />we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee
1756047 1757966 to parley with you now.
1758800 1763096 I wish to purchase<br />one of your nigger gals.
1764639 1767725 You and your Jimmie<br />rode from Texas to Tennessee
1767892 1769686 to buy one of my nigger gals?
1769853 1771521 No appointment, no nothin'?
1771688 1773606 Oh, I'm afraid so.
1773773 1776192 Well, what if I was to say<br />I don't like you?
1776359 1778027 Or your fancy-pants nigger?
1778194 1780405 And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.
1780572 1782532 Now what you got to say about that?
1785869 1787787 Mr. Bennett.
1787954 1791207 If you are the businessman<br />I've been led to believe you to be,
1791374 1796546 I have 5,000 things I might say<br />that could change your mind.
1800758 1804220 Well, come on inside and get<br />yourself somethin' cool to drink.
1806222 1807307 Hm-mm.
1818735 1820695 Oh, maybe while we discuss business,
1820862 1823406 you could provide one of<br />your loveliest black creatures
1823573 1825950 to escort Django here<br />around your magnificent grounds.
1826117 1828286 Oh, well, absolutely!<br />Uh, Betina.
1828453 1830205 -Yessir, Big Daddy?<br />-Uh...
1830371 1832248 What's your Jimmie's name again?
1832415 1833917 -Django.<br />-Django.
1834083 1836252 Betina, sugar, could you<br />take Django there
1836419 1839631 and take him around the grounds here<br />and show him all the pretty stuff.
1839797 1841090 As you please, Big Daddy.
1841257 1845178 Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you,<br />Django is a free man.
1845345 1848681 He cannot be treated like a slave.<br />He... within the bounds of good taste,
1848848 1851351 he must be treated<br />as an extension of myself.
1851518 1854521 -Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?<br />-Yes'm?
1854687 1859317 Django isn't a slave.<br />Django is a free man, you understand?
1860652 1862963 You can't treat him like any<br />of the other niggers around here,
1862987 1865907 'cause he ain't like any of the<br />other niggers around here. You got it?
1866074 1868952 You want I should<br />treat him like white folks?
1869118 1872247 No. That's not what I said.
1872413 1874958 Then I don't know what you want,<br />Big Daddy.
1875458 1879963 Yes, I can see that. Uh...
1880129 1884592 What's the name of that peckerwood boy<br />from town that works with the glass?
1884759 1886719 His mama work over at the lumberyard.
1886886 1889639 -Oh, you mean Jerry.<br />-That's the boy's name. Jerry!
1889806 1891307 You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?
1891474 1894602 -Yes'm, Big Daddy.<br />-Well, that's it, then.
1894769 1897730 You just treat him like you would Jerry.
1904696 1907407 That house we just left from<br />is The Big House.
1907574 1910493 Big Daddy call it that 'cause it's big.
1911661 1913830 That there is the pantry.
1913997 1917500 That's where Big Daddy<br />hang all his dead meat.
1917667 1919711 Po' little squirrels.
1921421 1923840 What you do for your massa?
1924007 1925807 Didn't you hear him tell you<br />I ain't no slave?
1925925 1928344 -So you really free?<br />-Yes, I's free.
1928511 1930847 You mean you wanna dress like that?
1932682 1935143 -Betina, I need to ask you somethin'.<br />-What you want?
1935310 1938396 I'm lookin' for three white men.<br />Three brothers. Overseers.
1938563 1940023 Their name is Brittle. You know 'em?
1940189 1942066 -Brittle?<br />-Yes, Brittle.
1942233 1946529 John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,<br />Roger Brittle, sometime called Lil Raj.
1946696 1948531 I don't know them.
1949115 1950950 They could be usin' a different name.
1951117 1953369 They woulda come to the plantation<br />this past year.
1953536 1956164 -You mean the Shaffers?<br />-Maybe.
1956331 1958458 -Three brothers?<br />-Uh-huh.
1958625 1960376 -They here?<br />-Uh-huh.
1960543 1962295 Could you point one of 'em out to me?
1962462 1964756 Well, one's over in that field.
1978853 1980581 Old Man Carrucan ain't<br />gonna appreciate this, now.
1980605 1981707 She work in the house, John.
1981731 1983751 You could mess her skin up,<br />and you gonna mess her up
1983775 1985878 and she ain't gonna be worth...<br />she ain't gonna be worth a damn thing.
1985902 1987209 Now, your Bible say...
1987688 1992168 <i>Felt like the weight of the world was on my shoulders</i>
1992367 1994535 Look, I told you<br />that I was one that made her do it.
1994702 1996277 You ready?
1996496 1998932 She didn't wanna run off with me. If<br />anybody should be gettin' whupped now,
1998956 2000476 it should be me. It should be me, John.
2000500 2003461 Now, I've been here long enough, you know<br />me, you know me a long time, now.
2004922 2011126 <i>Facing the fear that the truth, I discovered</i>
2013221 2015261 You know Massa Carrucan<br />ain't gonna appreciate this.
2015348 2016974 She's a... she's a house slave.
2017141 2018671 She a house slave, she can't be...
2020605 2027742 <i>I am looking for freedom, looking for freedom</i>
2029741 2034930 <i>And to find it cost me everything I have</i>
2037263 2039396 <i>Well I am looking for freedom...</i>
2039580 2042417 On my knees. I'm asking you this,<br />please. Ain't this what you want?
2042583 2044463 I'm keeping it funny for you.<br />Now, John, please.
2046947 2050320 <i>And to find it, may take everything I have</i>
2050425 2051551 I's on my knees, John.
2051718 2053678 I like the way you beg, boy.
2057640 2059976 Is that who you was lookin' for?
2061811 2062979 Yep.
2064272 2065565 Where the other two at?
2065732 2069485 They by the stable,<br />punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs.
2069652 2071320 They whippin' Little Jody?
2071946 2073823 Point me in that direction.
2074323 2077535 You go to that tree<br />and keep goin' that-a way.
2082165 2084250 Go get that white man<br />I came here with.
2085877 2087170 -Come on, now.<br />-No, no, please!
2087336 2088838 -Come on, girlie.<br />-Please!
2089005 2091549 Come on. Get you set up now.
2091716 2094177 "And the Lord said,<br />'The fear of ye...'"
2094343 2097305 '...and the dread of ye'
2097472 2099766 "'shall be on every beast<br />of the earth.'"
2101058 2102435 Come here now, woman!
2102602 2105688 You'd better give me that arm!
2122872 2124624 Okay, she's ready!
2138721 2142725 And after this, we'll see<br />if you break eggs again.
2146145 2148064 John Brittle!
2168626 2169795 You remember me?
2182223 2184600 I like the way you die, boy.
2190356 2192900 Goddamn son of a bitch!
2210960 2212420 Keep it funny!
2237987 2239447 Y'all wanna see somethin'?
2242950 2244619 No!
2254754 2256297 Who were they?
2257006 2260009 That's Big John,<br />and that's Lil Raj.
2260176 2261677 Where's Ellis?
2261844 2264180 He's the one hightailin' it<br />across that field right now.
2269018 2270519 -You sure that's him?<br />-Yeah.
2270686 2272605 -Positive?<br />-I don't know.
2272772 2275167 -You don't know if you're positive?<br />-I don't know what "positive" mean.
2275191 2276442 -It means you're sure.<br />-Yes.
2276609 2278903 -"Yes," what?<br />-Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.
2292124 2293709 I'm positive he dead.
2298756 2299757 Django!
2301550 2303970 Everybody calm down.
2304136 2306389 We mean no one else any harm.
2306555 2308099 Who are you two jokers?
2308265 2311268 I am Dr. King Schultz,<br />a legal representative
2311435 2314105 of the criminal justice system of<br />the United States of America.
2314271 2318859 The man to my left is Django Freeman.<br />He's my deputy.
2319026 2320987 In my pocket is a warrant,
2321153 2325241 signed by Circuit Court Judge<br />Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,
2325408 2329286 for the arrest and capture,<br />dead or alive,
2329453 2334458 of John Brittle,<br />Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.
2334625 2336711 They were goin' by the name Shaffer.
2338129 2342258 You know them by the name of Shaffer,<br />but the butchers' real name was Brittle.
2342425 2344093 These are wanted men.
2344260 2345720 The law wants 'em for murder.
2345886 2350016 Now, I reiterate, the warrant<br />states dead or alive,
2350182 2353477 so when Mr. Freeman and myself<br />executed these men on sight,
2353644 2357106 we were operating<br />within our legal boundaries.
2358232 2362611 I realize passions are high,
2362778 2366824 but I must warn you,<br />the penalty for taking deadly force
2366991 2369431 against an officer of the court<br />in the performance of his duty
2369535 2373456 is you'll be hung by the neck<br />until you're dead.
2376333 2381213 Now, may I please remove the warrant<br />from my pocket so you may examine it?
2383299 2384425 Gimme.
2400983 2402318 Satisfied?
2408824 2411118 May I have that back, please?
2416832 2419835 -Get off my land.<br />-Posthaste.
2420503 2424924 Load up the bodies as quickly as you can<br />and let's get outta here.
2450783 2454286 Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.
2494326 2495578 Come on, men!
2497788 2501292 -We're coming for you, nigger!<br />-Hee-haw!
2510509 2514930 Now, unless they start shootin' first,<br />nobody shoot 'em.
2515097 2517308 That's way too simple for these jokers.
2518058 2520686 We're gonna whup that<br />nigger-lover to death.
2520853 2525900 And I'm gonna personally<br />strip and clip that garboon myself.
2529778 2530988 Damn.
2532323 2534950 I can't see fuckin' shit<br />outta this thing.
2535868 2537161 We ready or what?
2537328 2539705 Aw, hold on,<br />I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.
2539872 2542249 Oh... Oh, shit.
2542416 2544627 I just made it worse.
2544793 2546837 Who made this goddamn shit?
2547004 2549965 -Willard's wife.<br />-Well, make your own goddamn masks!
2550132 2553719 Look, nobody's sayin'<br />they don't appreciate what Jenny did.
2553886 2556472 Well, if all I had to do<br />was cut a hole in a bag,
2556639 2558307 I coulda cut it better than this!
2558474 2561268 What about you, Robert?<br />Can you see?
2561435 2562645 Not too good.
2562811 2567149 I mean, if I don't move my head I can<br />see you pretty good, more or less.
2567316 2570819 But when I start ridin', the bag's<br />movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.
2570986 2573072 -Shit.<br />-Yeah.
2573614 2575282 I just made mine worse.
2576116 2577243 Oh, God.
2577409 2578953 Anybody bring any extra bags?
2579119 2582081 No, nobody brought an extra bag!
2582248 2583874 I'm just askin'.
2584041 2585834 Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?
2586001 2587211 Oh, well, shitfire!
2587378 2590464 If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,<br />that just defeats the purpose!
2590631 2592591 Well, I can't see<br />in this fuckin' thing!
2592758 2595612 I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing<br />and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!
2595636 2598055 Well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!
2598222 2602017 Now, I watched my wife work all day<br />gettin' 30 bags together
2602184 2604186 for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,
2604353 2608107 and all I can hear is<br />criticize, criticize, criticize!
2608274 2611443 From now on, don't ask me<br />or mine for nothin'!
2612736 2615614 Now, look, let's not forget<br />why we're here.
2615781 2618867 We got a killer nigger<br />over that hill there!
2619034 2620512 And we gotta make a lesson out of him.
2620536 2624373 Okay, I'm confused.<br />Are the bags on or off?
2624540 2629336 I think, we all think<br />the bag was a nice idea.
2629503 2630503 Yeah.
2630629 2634717 But not pointin' any fingers,<br />they coulda been done better.
2635676 2639388 So how 'bout no bags this time,
2639555 2644560 but next time we do the bags right<br />and then we go full regalia.
2644727 2646729 -I like that idea a lot.<br />-You get my vote, Robert.
2646895 2650232 Wait a minute!<br />I didn't say no bags.
2650399 2652401 But nobody can see.
2652568 2653652 So?
2653819 2655696 So it'd be nice to see.
2655863 2660617 Goddamn it! This is a raid!<br />I can't see, you can't see!
2660784 2666165 So what? All that matters is can<br />the fuckin' horse see! That's a raid!
2666332 2669126 Sons of bitches!
2669918 2671628 I can't see shit!
2671795 2675424 There he is! Get that nigger<br />out from under that wagon!
2676258 2678260 And get that nigger-lover<br />outta the wagon!
2678427 2680054 That nigger ain't down here,<br />Big Daddy!
2680220 2681638 -What?<br />-They tricked us!
2681805 2682848 Well, where are they?
2683015 2684433 <i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>.
2690147 2691940 Oh!
2692107 2693150 Bull's-eye.
2696153 2699448 Look at 'em run.
2702076 2704661 Yeah, cowards tend to do that.
2704828 2706789 Goddamn it!
2712920 2714171 Goddamn it!
2718801 2720511 Would you care to?
2727309 2729144 Can't see shit outta this!
2729770 2731939 -He's getting away.<br />-I got him.
2733982 2735442 Big Daddy's getting away.
2735609 2736860 I got him.
2752126 2753168 Got him.
2758006 2761009 The kid's a natural.
2771687 2775482 How you know Broomhilda's<br />first masters was German?
2775649 2777901 <i>Brunhilde</i> is a German name.
2778068 2780779 If they named her,<br />it stands to reason they'd be German.
2780946 2783198 Lots of gals where you're from<br />named Broomhilda?
2783991 2786952 <i>Brunhilde</i> is the name of a character
2787119 2791039 in the most popular<br />of all the German legends.
2791206 2793167 There's a story about Broomhilda?
2793333 2795043 Oh, yes, there is.
2801091 2804553 -Do you know it?<br />-Oh, every German knows that story.
2810976 2812352 Would you like me to tell you?
2813854 2819860 Well, <i>Brunhilde</i> was a princess.
2821695 2825782 She was a daughter of Wotan,<br />god of all gods.
2826825 2830037 Anyway, her father is really mad at her.
2830204 2831455 What she do?
2832414 2833874 I can't exactly remember.
2834041 2836710 She disobeys him in some way.
2836877 2840047 So he puts her on top of the mountain.
2840714 2841840 Broomhilda's on a mountain?
2842007 2843258 It's a German legend,
2843425 2846220 there's always going to be<br />a mountain in there somewhere.
2846386 2850432 And he puts a fire-breathing dragon<br />there to guard the mountain.
2852100 2857189 And he surrounds her<br />in a circle of hellfire.
2858649 2862986 And there, <i>Brunhilde</i> shall remain.
2864279 2869576 Unless a hero arises<br />brave enough to save her.
2870661 2872246 Does a fella arise?
2872412 2875374 Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,<br />he does.
2875541 2877584 A fella named Siegfried.
2878293 2879294 Does Siegfried save her?
2881463 2884091 Quite spectacularly so.
2885133 2889263 He scales the mountain,<br />because he's not afraid of it.
2889972 2894142 He slays the dragon,<br />because he's not afraid of him.
2894309 2896812 And he walks through hellfire...
2899147 2901525 because <i>Brunhilde's</i> worth it.
2905654 2907322 I know how he feel.
2908782 2911660 I think I'm just<br />starting to realize that.
2917165 2921336 Now, look, Django...
2924256 2928302 I don't doubt that one day<br />you'll save your lady love...
2929428 2933015 but I can't let you go to<br />Greenville in a good conscience.
2934057 2938520 A slave auction town in Mississippi<br />isn't the place for you to visit.
2938687 2941565 Free or not, it's just too dangerous.
2944526 2946695 But let me ask you a question.
2954202 2956622 How do you like the<br />bounty hunting business?
2958123 2960459 Kill white folks<br />and they pay you for it?
2961293 2962628 What's not to like?
2962794 2965213 Now, I have to admit,<br />we make a good team.
2965380 2968216 I thought you was mad at me<br />for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.
2968383 2970469 Yeah, on that occasion<br />you were a tad overzealous,
2970636 2972596 but normally, that's a good thing.
2973388 2975599 How'd you like to partner up<br />for the winter?
2975766 2977768 What you mean "partner up"?
2977934 2982230 You work with me through the winter<br />till the snow melts...
2983231 2985233 I give you a third of my bounties.
2986443 2990364 So we make some money this winter,<br />and when the snow melts,
2990530 2993450 I'll take you to Greenville myself
2993617 2996828 and we'll find<br />where they sent your wife.
3001083 3002834 Why you care what happen to me?
3004586 3006546 Why you care if I find my wife?
3006713 3008090 Frankly...
3009383 3012260 I've never given anybody<br />their freedom before.
3012427 3016264 And now that I have,<br />I feel vaguely responsible for you.
3017516 3021228 Plus, when a German meets a real life<br />Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.
3023772 3026650 As a German, I'm obliged<br />to help you on your quest
3026817 3029444 to rescue your beloved <i>Brunhilde</i>.
3042264 3045706 <i>Like the pine trees linin' the windin' road</i>
3046592 3051384 <i>I've got a name, I've got a name</i>
3053520 3057008 <i>Like the singin' bird and the croakin' toad</i>
3057782 3062319 <i>I've got a name, I've got a name</i>
3064662 3068437 <i>And I carry it with me like my daddy did</i>
3068923 3073821 <i>But I'm living the dream that he kept hid</i>
3075675 3077593 <i>Movin' me down the highway</i>
3078340 3080558 <i>Rollin' me down the highway</i>
3081164 3084343 <i>Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by</i>
3089792 3092863 <i>Like the north wind whistlin' down the sky</i>
3093823 3098373 <i>I've got a song, I've got a song</i>
3100709 3104095 <i>Like the whippoorwill and the baby's cry</i>
3104869 3109480 <i>I've got a song, I've got a song</i>
3111925 3115533 <i>And I carry it with me and I sing it loud</i>
3116056 3120906 <i>If it gets me nowhere, I'll go there proud</i>
3122511 3124562 <i>Movin' me down the highway</i>
3125300 3127359 <i>Rollin' me down the highway</i>
3127982 3131381 <i>Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by</i>
3158740 3159741 You got her.
3166540 3171461 Ooh. What happened to Mr. "I Wanna<br />Shoot White Folks For Money"?
3171628 3174339 -His son's with him.<br />-Well, good.
3174506 3176091 He'll have a loved one with him.
3176258 3178760 Maybe even share a last word.
3180762 3182806 That's better than most of them get.
3182973 3185267 Damn sight better than he deserves.
3193441 3194776 Put down the rifle.
3197779 3199489 Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.
3200282 3202617 Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
3206580 3208081 Read it aloud.
3208957 3210750 Consider that today's lesson.
3213169 3215839 "Wanted. Dead or alive."
3216798 3220719 "Smitty Bacall and the<br />Smitty Bacall
3220886 3223138 -Gang.<br />-Gang."
3223305 3226975 "For murder and stagecoach..."
3228393 3229936 robbery.
3230103 3232898 -Seven-zero-zero-zero..."<br />-Seven thousand.
3233064 3234399 Thousand.
3234566 3238778 "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall."
3238945 3244034 $1,500 for each of his...
3244200 3245994 "gang..."
3247037 3249039 -Mem...<br />-"Members."
3249748 3254377 "Known members of the Smitty Bacall<br />Gang are as follas:"
3254544 3256296 -Follows.<br />-"Follows."
3256463 3260175 "Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and..."
3261301 3263219 Crazy Craig Koons.
3264220 3266473 That is who Smitty Bacall is.
3266640 3269517 If Smitty Bacall wanted<br />to start a farm at 22,
3269684 3271645 they would never have printed that.
3272354 3275774 But Smitty Bacall<br />wanted to rob stagecoaches
3275941 3278360 and he didn't mind<br />killing people to do it.
3279027 3282364 Do you want to save your wife<br />by doing what I do?
3283615 3285075 This is what I do.
3285241 3288787 I kill people and<br />sell their corpses for cash.
3289704 3293500 This corpse is worth $7,000.
3293667 3295877 Now quit your pussyfooting<br />and shoot him.
3306012 3307389 Pa?
3307555 3308890 Pa!
3317357 3319067 Here.
3319234 3321319 You need to keep this<br />Smitty Bacall handbill.
3321486 3323571 -Why?<br />-It's good luck.
3323738 3326533 You always keep the handbill<br />of your first bounty.
3374456 3375874 That's accurate.
3444192 3447320 Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?
3448363 3450532 Who the hell-a you got there?
3450698 3452659 The Wilson-Lowe Gang.
3452826 3455829 Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?
3456538 3461084 Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner<br />Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.
3461251 3464879 Huh. Well, just leave 'em out here,<br />they ain't going nowhere.
3465046 3467423 Why don't you come in then<br />out of the snowy snow
3467590 3469425 and get yourselves some coffee.
3469592 3472137 We had a birthday yesterday.<br />Got some cake.
3472303 3473721 Pretty good.
3495869 3498204 Move along!
3503543 3505628 Move it, boy!
3507172 3508423 Keep movin'.
3508590 3510550 Get on up on that auction block.
3512093 3514470 Don't let that mud slow you down.<br />Keep going.
3530904 3532155 Keep goin'!
3534616 3538536 "Broomhilda Von Shaft. Age 27.
3538703 3540121 'r' on right cheek."
3541789 3544042 Calvin Candie.
3544209 3548630 He owns the fourth biggest cotton<br />plantation in Mississippi: Candyland.
3548796 3550131 Candyland?
3550298 3551382 Oh, so you've heard of it.
3551549 3553635 Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
3553801 3556471 Well, apparently,<br />that's where your wife is...
3556638 3558306 and that's the repellant gentleman
3558473 3562018 who owns her. Let's just hope she<br />works in the house, not in the field.
3562185 3564312 Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.
3564479 3566481 She... she pretty.
3567148 3569067 And she talk good, too.
3570652 3572492 But when they tore her back up<br />and then they...
3573655 3575823 burned that runaway "r"<br />on her cheek...
3577242 3578409 they goddamned her.
3583122 3584642 She ain't no field nigger<br />but she ain't good enough
3584666 3586668 for the house no more either.
3586834 3588270 They gonna try to<br />make her a comfort girl.
3588294 3590171 What's a comfort...? Oh.
3591089 3592382 Not while I got freedom.
3593967 3595760 Not while I got my gun.
3598846 3600556 So do we offer to buy her?
3603184 3604560 So...
3606145 3607814 say...
3609983 3613194 a man wants to buy a horse.
3613361 3615405 Needs to buy a horse.
3616364 3619325 He walks up to the farmer's farm,<br />and he knocks on the farmer's door
3619492 3621160 and asks the farmer to buy his horse.
3621327 3623121 And do you know what the farmer says?
3623288 3625498 The farmer says no.
3627000 3631963 Well, I say fuck that farmer,<br />and I'm stealin' that horse.
3632130 3636259 Fair enough. But now you're a horse<br />thief, and they hang horse thieves.
3636426 3638626 Not to mention the horse<br />goes back to its original owner
3638720 3640346 because the horse is still his property.
3640513 3644392 We need her and we need a bill of sale.
3644559 3647159 Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her,<br />then how we gonna get her?
3647937 3651524 May I offer an alternative<br />plan of action?
3651691 3653192 Go ahead.
3653359 3657905 So... the man walks up<br />to the farmer's farm,
3658072 3659615 he knocks on the farmer's door...
3660325 3665371 and asks not to buy the horse,<br />but the farm.
3665538 3668916 And makes an offer so ridiculous,
3669083 3671878 the farmer is forced to say yes.
3672754 3675506 -We gonna offer to buy Candyland?<br />-No, it's far too big.
3675673 3678926 But apparently this farmer<br />ain't all about the farm.
3680386 3682430 How much do you know<br />about Mandingo fighting?
3682597 3683598 What?
3683765 3686601 Can you convincingly<br />masquerade as someone
3686768 3688436 who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?
3688603 3689645 Why?
3689812 3693441 Because my character is that<br />of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,
3693608 3697028 here in Greenville to buy my way<br />into the Mandingo fight game.
3697195 3701115 And your character is a Mandingo expert<br />I hired to help me do it.
3701282 3703242 They call that "One-Eyed Charley."
3706329 3707789 <i>Bonjour.</i>
3710875 3713795 We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie.
3713961 3715546 <i>Entraz.</i>
3718049 3719509 -Thank you.<br />-Hm-mm.
3720551 3723179 You want me to play a black slaver?
3723346 3726015 Ain't nothin' lower than a black slaver.
3726182 3729644 A black slaver is lower<br />than the head house nigger...
3730311 3732438 and, buddy,<br />that's pretty fuckin' low.
3733564 3735566 Then play him that way.
3735733 3739779 Give me your black slaver.
3742448 3747412 <i>Along came the 219<br />Toot! Toot! Peanut butter!</i>
3751165 3753042 Dr. Schultz!
3753209 3756421 -Good to see you again!<br />-Mr. Moguy.
3756587 3759382 Thank you for your assistance<br />in creating the opportunity
3759549 3762343 -for this appointment.<br />-Nonsense, it's my job.
3762510 3765346 So this is the One-Eyed Charley<br />I've heard so much about.
3765513 3767932 Yes, this is Django Freeman.
3768099 3770768 Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,<br />Leonide Moguy.
3770935 3772895 Just call me Leo.
3773062 3776232 Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.<br />You all wanna follow me?
3776399 3778693 How long have you been<br />associated with Mr. Candie?
3778860 3781320 Oh, Calvin's father and I<br />were about 11
3781487 3783281 when we went to<br />boarding school together.
3783448 3786534 Calvin's father's father<br />put me through law school.
3786701 3789704 One could almost say<br />I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.
3789871 3791622 One could almost say youse a nigger.
3792498 3793916 What did you say?
3794083 3796836 -I said...<br />-Nothing, he's just being cheeky.
3797378 3801799 Uh, anything else about Mr. Candie<br />that I should know before I meet him?
3801966 3803968 Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.
3804135 3805928 What civilized people aren't?
3806095 3808347 And he prefers Monsieur Candie<br />to Mr. Candie.
3811142 3815146 He doesn't speak French. Don't speak<br />French to him, it'll embarrass him.
3818065 3820318 Get back on top, now!<br />Turn around!
3820485 3821986 There you go.
3822153 3823779 There you go.
3825656 3827909 Why do you want to get in<br />the Mandingo business?
3830745 3834499 You don't intend to allow your second<br />to make the proper introductions?
3835249 3837126 Quit stalling, now.
3837293 3838628 Answer the question.
3841297 3844717 The awful truth? I'm bored.
3844884 3847261 This seems like a good bit of fun.
3852183 3854185 Well, come on over.
3854352 3857063 We got us a fight goin' on<br />that's a good bit of fun.
3861108 3862568 Won't you accompany me to the bar?
3871827 3874307 You don't wear a hat in the house,<br />white man. Even I know that.
3883381 3884799 -Dr. Schultz.<br />-What a rare pleasure.
3884966 3886384 Keep fighting, niggers.
3886551 3889345 -And I might add, an honor.<br />-Honor to meet you.
3889512 3891430 Please have a seat,<br />the pleasure's all mine.
3891597 3895101 Get free man Django here<br />whatever he wants.
3895268 3897562 And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.
3917206 3920251 Use your weight, boy,<br />use your weight! There you go.
3920418 3922670 He's much bigger and stronger!
3922837 3924422 Come on, now!
3924589 3927091 He's not doing what I told him,<br />for God's sakes.
3931178 3933973 Come on, now, boy!<br />It's a fight to the death!
3934140 3937226 You either hit him or are you ain't?
3945234 3948321 Big Fred, come on!
3948487 3950031 Turn him around! Now...
3953826 3958164 Use your strength, boy!<br />Come on, now! Use your strength!
3960249 3962043 There you go!
3963377 3965838 There you go! Look at that.
3966922 3969884 See, I told you to put<br />some more power in there.
3970051 3972094 Do what I told you, boy!
3972261 3973721 There you go!
3973888 3976182 -No!<br />-Do what I told ya!
3976349 3979393 Blind him black, boy!<br />Blind him black!
3981812 3984315 Oh, no, Luigi.
3987526 3991447 Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
3992073 3993240 Oh...
4003793 4005086 Finish him.
4009382 4011133 Go on, boy, finish him!
4015638 4017348 That's why they<br />call him Big Fred.
4017515 4020935 -Worth every penny.<br />-Well, <i>arrivederci</i>, Luigi.
4021102 4023312 Come on up, now, boy.<br />Get yourself a rest.
4023479 4026482 You did a fine job.<br />A real fine job.
4027108 4028818 Mercedes.
4049922 4051132 Tequila.
4061142 4062643 What's your name?
4064812 4066313 Django.
4068733 4070401 Can you spell it?
4072528 4076574 D-J-A-N-G-O.
4078075 4079577 The D is silent.
4079744 4081328 I know.
4089295 4092798 Mr. Moguy, want you to<br />take care of my new boy here.
4092965 4094675 You find him a room<br />with a soft bed,
4094842 4097428 then you bring him up<br />a pony to lick his pole.
4097595 4100395 But you be ready to travel to Candyland<br />tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?
4100514 4101515 Yessir, Monsieur Candie.
4101682 4105561 Before you go,<br />Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.
4109398 4112401 You enjoy that, boy.<br />You've earned it.
4112568 4113861 Yessir.
4123370 4127166 -What's your name, boy?<br />-His name is Django Freeman.
4130711 4132338 Where'd you dig him up?
4132505 4135758 A fortuitous turn of events<br />brought Django and myself together.
4137468 4139553 I've heard tell about you.
4140304 4143057 I heard you been telling everybody<br />them Mandingos ain't no damn good.
4143224 4145351 Ain't nothin' nobody<br />is sellin' is worth buyin'.
4145518 4149730 I'm curious... what makes you<br />such a Mandingo expert?
4151690 4154109 I'm curious what makes you so curious.
4157404 4159490 -What did you say, boy?<br />-Calm down, Butch.
4160533 4161867 No offense given...
4162701 4163911 none taken.
4164078 4165788 Monsieur Candie...
4165955 4169458 I'd appreciate if you could<br />direct your line of inquiry toward me.
4169625 4171085 One...
4171710 4174839 you do not have anything to drink.<br />Can I get you a tasty refreshment?
4175005 4177842 -Yes! I'll have a beer.<br />-<i>Wunderbar</i>.
4178008 4179844 Roscoe, a beer<br />for the man with the beard,
4180010 4181846 and I will have a<br />Polynesian Pearl Diver.
4182012 4184098 Do not spare the rum.
4184265 4187768 Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.
4187935 4189645 You are, well, you are a neophyte.
4189812 4194942 I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this<br />cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.
4196402 4199613 With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...
4200322 4202199 I didn't seek you<br />out for your advice.
4202366 4204493 I sought you out to<br />purchase a fighting nigger
4204660 4207204 at above top-dollar market price.
4207371 4209915 Now I was under the impression,<br />when you granted me an audience,
4210082 4212459 it would be to discuss business.
4215170 4217631 Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.
4217798 4220134 We were discussin' my curiosity.
4222428 4223429 Thank you.
4223596 4226307 Roscoe, Coco,<br />go outside and play.
4228309 4231770 Sheba... you stay right there.
4231937 4233480 I know you didn't mean me.
4235232 4237735 -Prost!<br />-German.
4238652 4242448 Now, according to Moguy,<br />if I do business with you,
4242615 4244658 I'm doing business with both y'all.
4244825 4247244 He does the eyeballin',<br />you the billfold? Is that it?
4247411 4251165 Well, you don't make it sound<br />too flattering, but more or less, yeah.
4251332 4252499 Hm.
4253792 4254793 So...
4254960 4256879 Bright Boy...
4257046 4259006 Moguy tells me<br />you looked over my African flesh
4259173 4261342 and you was<br />none too impressed, huh?
4261508 4263010 Not for top dollar.
4265179 4267222 Well, then,<br />we got nothin' more to talk about.
4267389 4269516 You see, you wanna buy<br />a beat-ass nigger from me,
4269683 4271936 those are the beat-ass niggers<br />I wanna sell so...
4272102 4274063 He don't wanna buy the niggers<br />you wanna sell.
4275022 4278192 He wants the nigger<br />you don't wanna sell.
4278359 4282655 Well, I don't sell the niggers<br />I don't wanna sell.
4284907 4288577 Well, you won't sell your best.
4288744 4291163 You won't even sell your second best.
4291330 4295000 But your third best...?<br />You don't want to sell him either.
4295167 4299088 But if I made you an offer so ridiculous<br />you'd be forced to consider it...
4299880 4301924 who knows what could happen?
4304259 4306553 And what do you consider ridiculous?
4307554 4311642 For a truly talented specimen,<br />the right nigger?
4313394 4315437 How much would you say, Django?
4318816 4320526 Twelve thousand dollars.
4325072 4329076 Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,
4329243 4331161 but now you have my attention.
4344842 4350514 Willie. Willie.<br />Hold up! Hold up. Ah!
4350681 4353100 -Good morning, gentlemen.<br />-Good Dr. Schultz.
4353267 4357187 -Beautiful morning, isn't it?<br />-You couldn't have picked a better one.
4357354 4360232 Please, won't you take a ride with us<br />here in the Victoria.
4360399 4361942 Oh, thank you very much.
4362109 4364236 You can tie your horse up back there.
4372453 4373746 Django.
4378542 4382171 Where I part company from many<br />of my phrenologist colleagues
4382337 4387509 is I believe there is a level<br />above bright, above talented,
4387676 4391805 above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.
4391972 4396643 Say, one nigger that<br />just pops up in 10,000.
4396810 4398312 The exceptional nigger.
4399313 4401356 Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?
4402483 4403650 Sun is up.
4404818 4406695 Shining on all of us.
4411450 4414369 -Have a seat, doc.<br />-Thank you.
4414536 4415829 Quite an honor.
4415996 4417706 -The honor is all ours.<br />-Thank you.
4417873 4421251 But I do believe that,<br />given time,
4421418 4424379 exceptional niggers<br />like Bright Boy here...
4425339 4427174 become if not frequent...
4428425 4430052 more frequent.
4431804 4436391 Bright Boy,<br />you are that one in 10,000.
4436558 4439436 The name of the game is keep up,<br />not catch up, nigger.
4452324 4453700 Whoa!
4455202 4458622 -Touch your guns, you die.<br />-Everybody, calm down!
4458789 4460707 Now I saw the whole thing.<br />No harm done.
4460874 4461917 Are you kidding me?
4462084 4464086 -This nigger just...<br />-I said no harm done!
4464253 4466797 Now take your hand off your pistol!
4467881 4470676 Butch, that means you too.
4471885 4474888 Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.
4476390 4478600 Hoot! Get back up on your horse.
4479351 4480894 He broke my collarbone!
4481061 4485357 For God's sake, somebody please help<br />Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.
4485524 4488569 -Yessir, boss.<br />-Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.
4489945 4491464 You better listen to your boss,<br />white boy.
4491488 4493949 Oh, I'm gonna go<br />walking in the moonlight with you.
4494116 4495909 You wanna hold my hand?
4502499 4505169 Willie, take us home.
4507421 4509423 Start moving!
4515804 4517055 Head 'em out!
4525296 4528847 <i>I need 100 black coffins for 100 bad men</i>
4528848 4532153 <i>And 100 black graves so I can lay they ass in</i>
4532154 4535634 <i>I need 100 black preachers with a black sermon to tell</i>
4535635 4538928 <i>From 100 black Bibles while we send them all to hell</i>
4538929 4541450 <i>I need 100 black coffins, black coffins</i>
4541451 4544910 <i>Black coffins</i>
4544911 4545547 <i>Oh Lord</i>
4545548 4548192 <i>I need 100 black coffins, black coffins</i>
4548193 4550079 <i>Black coffins</i>
4550080 4551080 <i>Oh no</i>
4551838 4552548 <i>Black coffins</i>
4552548 4553548 <i>I need a hu...</i>
4562684 4564284 You got a problem<br />with your eyeball, boy?
4564394 4565646 No, sir.
4565812 4567314 You want a boot heel in it?
4568523 4569523 No, sir.
4569650 4572694 Then you keep your<br />goddamn eyeballs off me.
4572861 4575989 You flash that bad look at me again,<br />I'll give you a reason not to like me.
4576156 4577699 Now move, nigger!
4579826 4581954 You niggers are gonna<br />understand something about me.
4582120 4583997 I'm worse than any of these<br />white men here.
4584164 4587751 You get the molasses out your ass,<br />you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.
4587918 4590963 He is a rambunctious sort,<br />ain't he?
4591129 4592464 Indeed.
4594967 4598345 May we stop for a moment<br />so I may put a word in my man's ear?
4598512 4602224 You know, I'm expecting to fall in love<br />once I see the specimens at Candyland,
4602391 4605477 so before that moment,<br />it would be good if I could have
4605644 4610023 a confidential strategy meeting<br />with my confidant.
4612985 4614820 You mind telling me<br />what the hell you doing?
4614987 4617030 I confirmed that <i>Brunhilde's</i><br />at Candyland.
4621076 4623662 -You're sure it's her?<br />-He didn't call her by name,
4623829 4627207 but she's a young lady, whip marks<br />on her back and speaks German.
4627374 4629251 Now, while it's not wise to assume,
4629418 4631878 in this instance,<br />I think it's pretty safe.
4632045 4636675 Point being, don't get so<br />carried away with your retribution.
4636842 4638802 You lose sight of why we're here.
4638969 4640762 -You think I lost sight of that?<br />-Yes, I do.
4640929 4643432 Stop antagonizing Candie.
4643598 4648562 You're going to blow this whole charade,<br />or more than likely get us both killed.
4648729 4653400 And I, for one, don't intend to die<br />in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.
4653567 4656570 I'm not antagonizing him.<br />I'm intriguing him.
4656737 4659281 You're yelling abuse<br />at these poor slaves.
4660282 4665704 I recall the man who had me<br />kill another man in front of his son
4665871 4667664 and he didn't bat a eye.
4669082 4670208 You remember that?
4672461 4673795 Yeah, of course I remember.
4673962 4677424 What you said was that<br />this is my world...
4678383 4680385 and in my world you gotta get dirty.
4681386 4684264 So that's what I'm doing.<br />I'm gettin' dirty.
4687934 4691104 Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...
4692564 4694649 that was the general gist.
4698403 4699905 See you at Candyland.
4707621 4710207 All right, niggers, back at it.
4711500 4713543 That means you too, Moonlight.
4760924 4763802 I'll be. D'Artagnan!
4763969 4767222 Now, boy, why do a<br />fool thing like run off?
4767389 4769474 I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.
4769641 4770934 Yes, you can.
4771101 4774646 You might not be able to win,<br />but your ass can fight.
4774813 4777232 Mr. Stonesipher, would you please<br />shut these goddamn dogs up?
4777399 4780026 -I cannot hear myself think!<br />-Quiet down, Marsha!
4780193 4782237 Marsha, hush up! Marsha!
4782404 4783947 Hush up! Hey!
4784114 4786741 Get these goddamn dogs<br />away from this nigger!
4796251 4799713 Come on now, boy...<br />get on out that tree.
4799880 4801548 Yessir.
4824112 4826239 How long was he loose?
4826406 4829659 A night. Day.
4829826 4831453 Half the other night.
4832579 4834122 How far he get off the property?
4834289 4835999 'Bout 20 miles off the prop.
4836166 4838293 Pretty far considering<br />that limp he got.
4838460 4839836 Hm.
4841087 4844424 Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan<br />supposed to fight on Friday?
4844591 4846218 One-a this new lot.
4847385 4850096 Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian<br />wouldn't bet a bead on him.
4850263 4852766 Please, Monsieur Candie,<br />I ain't got it in me no more.
4852933 4854434 -Now, now, now, now, now.<br />-I can't...
4854601 4857020 Now, no beggin'.
4857187 4859648 No playin' on my soft heart.
4863109 4865654 -You in trouble now, son.<br />-Yessir.
4868573 4872118 I done paid $500 for you.
4872285 4877165 When I pay $500, then I expect<br />to get five fights out of a nigger
4877332 4879709 -'fore he roll over and play dead.<br />-Sir.
4879876 4883755 You got to understand<br />that I'm runnin' a business here.
4883922 4886633 -You fought three fights.<br />-But I won every one.
4886800 4888301 Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
4888468 4891471 But that last one, you muddled the line<br />between winnin' and losin'.
4891638 4892681 Yessir.
4895350 4897394 Still, the fact remains:
4897561 4901189 I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!
4901356 4903900 So what about my $500, huh?
4905777 4907696 What about my $500?
4909239 4910782 You gonna reimburse me?
4916788 4919165 You even know what "reimburse" means?
4919332 4921376 Huh?
4927674 4929384 I'll reimburse you!
4933138 4934347 You will?
4935557 4937100 Yep.
4939853 4942564 You'll pay $500
4942731 4946192 for practically a one-eyed old Joe<br />ain't fit to push a broom?
4946359 4947485 No, he won't.
4949738 4951823 He just tired of you<br />toyin' with him is all.
4952741 4954701 Matter of fact, so am I.
4954868 4957329 But we ain't payin' a penny<br />for that pickaninny.
4957495 4959375 Ain't got no use for him.<br />Ain't that right, doc?
4961041 4962250 You heard him.
4971426 4975180 You're gonna have to excuse<br />Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.
4975347 4979017 He ain't never seen a<br />nigger like you ever in his life.
4979809 4981770 Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?
4984022 4985482 That right.
4986483 4987817 For that matter...
4989110 4990695 nor have I.
4996785 4997952 Now...
4999120 5002248 seein' as you won't pay a penny<br />for this pickaninny here...
5004751 5008088 you won't mind me handlin'<br />this nigger any way I see fit?
5009214 5010757 He's your nigger.
5014511 5016596 Mr. Stonesipher?
5017389 5021351 Let Marsha and her bitches<br />send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
5021518 5026314 Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!
5027774 5029984 Get 'im, get 'im!
5031027 5033530 -Yeah!<br />-Whoo!
5033697 5035115 Whoo-ee!
5063476 5065520 Your boss looks a little<br />green around the gills
5065687 5067856 for a blood sport like nigger fighting.
5068022 5072652 Nah, he just ain't used to seein'<br />a man ripped apart by dogs is all.
5073236 5074529 Hm.
5075613 5076990 You are used to it?
5077157 5080118 I'm just a little more<br />used to Americans than he is.
5080285 5084998 -Hm.<br />-Now, Monsieur Candie...
5085165 5086791 whenever you're ready.
5086958 5090336 We rode five hours<br />so you could show off your stock.
5090503 5092130 Let's get to it.
5093339 5097719 'Cause as of now,<br />if he's an example, I ain't impressed.
5099929 5101347 Follow me.
5218631 5221342 Line 'em up to the left here now, boy.
5222969 5224345 Stand up straight, now!
5225513 5226806 Get up there.
5226973 5229559 Get up there, boy. Come on.
5229726 5231352 Give me a line! Give me a line!
5231519 5233605 Get in line there! Straighten up!
5293247 5294874 Hello! Stephen, my boy!
5295041 5297710 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />Hello, my ass.
5297877 5300838 Who this nigger up on that nag?
5301005 5304342 Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?<br />What's-a matter? Why you so ornery?
5304509 5306886 -You miss me, huh?<br />-Oh, yessir.
5307053 5310598 I miss you like a hog miss slop!
5310765 5314686 Like a baby miss mammy's titty.
5314852 5318690 I miss you like I misses<br />a rock in my shoe.
5321109 5325571 Now, I asked you:<br />Who this nigger on that nag?
5325738 5327407 Hey Snowball?
5328616 5332203 Wanna know my name or<br />the name of my horse, you ask me.
5332370 5335206 Just who the hell you callin'<br />"Snowball," horse boy?
5335373 5337533 I'll snatch your<br />black ass off that nag down here
5337608 5338727 -in the mud so fast...<br />-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
5338751 5340837 -make your head spin.<br />-Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.
5341004 5345299 Let's keep it funny.<br />Django here's a free man.
5345466 5347844 -This nigger here?<br />-That nigger there.
5348011 5350263 Let me at least<br />introduce the two of you.
5350430 5354225 Django, this is another cheeky<br />black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
5354392 5357645 Stephen, this here's Django.<br />You two oughta hate each other.
5357812 5361816 Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger<br />you feels the need to entertain?
5361983 5365903 Django and his friend in gray here,<br />Dr. Schultz, are customers.
5366070 5367447 And they are our guests, Stephen.
5367613 5371117 And you, you old decrepit bastard,<br />oughta show them every hospitality.
5371284 5373661 -You understand that?<br />-Yessir. Him I understand.
5373828 5375639 But I don't know why<br />I got to take lip off this nigger.
5375663 5378291 You don't have to know why.<br />Do you understand?
5379292 5380793 Yessir. I understand.
5380960 5383421 Well, good.<br />They're spendin' the night.
5383588 5385715 Go up in the guest bedrooms<br />and get two ready.
5386883 5388551 He gonna stay in The Big House?
5388718 5390928 Stephen, he's a slaver.<br />It's different.
5391095 5393681 -In The Big House?<br />-Well, you got a problem with that?
5393848 5396142 Oh, no.<br />I ain't got no problem with it,
5396309 5398495 if you ain't got no problem<br />with burnin' the bed, the sheets,
5398519 5400998 the pillowcases, everything else when<br />this black-ass motherfucker's gone!
5401022 5403274 That is my problem!<br />They are mine to burn!
5403441 5405651 Now your problem right now<br />is makin' a good impression!
5405818 5407880 And I want you to start solvin'<br />that problem right now
5407904 5409530 and get them goddamn rooms ready!
5411657 5413576 Yessir, Monsieur Candie.
5415036 5416204 Go on, now.
5417121 5419540 Can't believe you brought<br />a nigger to stay in The Big House.
5419707 5421185 Your daddy rollin' over<br />in his goddamned grave.
5421209 5424754 Man, the lip on him. Whoo!<br />He's gettin' worse and worse.
5424921 5426089 Now...
5426255 5430927 Where is my beautiful sister?!
5431094 5434180 There she is!<br />Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
5434347 5439393 Dr. Schultz, this attractive<br />Southern belle is my widowed sister.
5439560 5443564 Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes.
5444816 5448194 May I present to you<br />Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
5448361 5451739 Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.<br />Y'all get your ass over by that pen.
5451906 5454033 -Come on, Charly. Come on, now!<br />-Let's go.
5454200 5455243 You know where it is.
5455409 5457161 Like you on a rope!
5458371 5461124 Niggers don't walk around here,<br />niggers run!
5461833 5464836 -Monsieur Candie?<br />-Hm?
5465002 5468798 Yeah. About that matter about the<br />nigger girl you were talking about?
5468965 5469965 Nigger gal?
5470091 5473094 Yeah, I believe you mentioned<br />she spoke German.
5473261 5475847 Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?
5476013 5480184 Do you think before the demonstration,<br />you could send her around to my room?
5480351 5484522 You little dickens, you.<br />I don't see why not.
5484689 5488067 Stephen, when you get through showin'<br />them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,
5488234 5490069 get her cleaned up<br />and smellin' real nice,
5490236 5491797 and sent over to<br />Dr. Schultz's room here.
5491821 5493489 Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,
5493656 5496325 there's-a somethin'<br />I ain't told you 'bout yet.
5496534 5500204 -What?<br />-Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box.
5501706 5502874 What's she doin' there?
5503040 5505793 What you think she<br />doin' there in the Hot Box?
5505960 5507420 She bein' punished.
5507587 5509922 -What she do?<br />-She run off again.
5510089 5512758 Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people<br />ran away while I was gone?
5512925 5515428 -Two.<br />-When did she go?
5515595 5518097 Last night.<br />They brung her back this morning.
5518264 5520933 How bad did Stonesipher's dogs<br />tear her up?
5521851 5525354 Lucky for her,<br />they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.
5525521 5529817 Bill and Cody went lookin' for her,<br />found her, brung her back.
5529984 5532904 Now, she a little beat-up.<br />But she done that to her own damn self
5533070 5534423 runnin' through them<br />damn bushes and shit.
5534447 5536115 How long she been in the box?
5536282 5539076 How long you think<br />she been in there? All damn day.
5539243 5541913 And the little bitch<br />got ten more days to be in there.
5542079 5545124 -Still, take her out.<br />-Take her out? Why?
5545291 5549212 Because I said so, that's why.<br />Dr. Schultz is my guest.
5549378 5550378 Hildi is my nigger.
5550504 5553674 Southern hospitality dictates<br />I make her available to him.
5553841 5557053 -But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.<br />-Jesus Christ, Stephen.
5557220 5559639 What is the point of havin'<br />a nigger that speaks German
5559805 5562266 if you can't wheel 'em out<br />when you have a German guest?
5562433 5566604 Now, I realize it is inconvenient,<br />but still, you take her ass out.
5566771 5567939 Yessir.
5569232 5571817 Lara Lee!<br />Will you and Cora be responsible
5571984 5575363 for gettin' Hildi cleaned up<br />and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.
5575529 5576906 Of course, darlin'.
5577073 5581953 Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am<br />weary from our travels beyond words.
5582119 5584997 It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.
5589835 5592588 Y'all done heard the man!<br />Get her ass up outta there!
5592755 5595299 Cora! Come here!
5595466 5598511 Get over there and get her cleaned up,<br />bring her back over here to Dr...
5598678 5601055 -What he say your name is? Shoots?<br />-Schultz.
5601222 5603683 Schultz. Get her back over here.<br />Hurry up, girl.
5603849 5607228 Yessir.
5650813 5653524 Come on, girl. Stand up.
5683554 5687099 Is you comin' with me or is you gonna<br />sleep in that little box over yonder?

5782278 5783737 Hello, ladies.
5783904 5787283 Dr. Schultz.<br />May I introduce to you Broomhilda?
5791454 5793914 Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.
5795374 5797501 It's a pleasure to meet you, <i>Brunhilde</i>.
5798544 5800880 I've heard a lot of<br />good things about you.
5801046 5803841 Well, it's not every nigger<br />speaks German, don't ya know.
5807094 5809096 As I look at you now, <i>Brunhilde</i>,
5809263 5814226 I can see all the passions you inspire<br />are completely justified.
5817563 5819899 The doctor here speaks German.
5821901 5823861 And I've been informed you do as well?
5825404 5827573 Go ahead, girl.<br />Speak a little German.
5834121 5835748 Ha!
5835915 5837917 Astonishing.
5844882 5847092 -And I shall bring you...<br />-Much obliged.
5856602 5857728 <i>Ja</i>.
5881126 5882586 Don't be afraid.
5920666 5923168 Hm. Pardon.
5930759 5932052 <i>Danke</i>.
6037491 6039076 Hey, Little Trouble Maker.
6047668 6050963 You silver-tongued devil, you.
6052548 6054025 -Hurry up, girl.<br />-These ready, Miss Cora.
6054049 6055409 No, no, no, they drinkin' tonight.
6055467 6058507 Go downstairs, get the big jug with the<br />red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?
6058595 6061348 -Get your big pretty ass out the way.<br />-You know you like it.
6061515 6063726 That's 'cause<br />you knows what I like.
6063892 6066478 Ooh!<br />Come on with these biscuits, girl.
6066645 6072443 Look, Monsieur Candie, they were<br />all fine specimens, no doubt about it.
6072609 6076989 But the best three by far were Samson...
6078365 6079950 -What's that other one's name?<br />-Goldie.
6080117 6083454 Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.
6083620 6086206 By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?
6086373 6089460 You never know how<br />these nigger nicknames get started.
6089626 6092212 His name was Joe, maybe one day<br />he said he was cold. Who knows?
6095883 6101221 Well, regardless, Samson's your best.<br />We all know that.
6101388 6105100 You will never sell him,<br />and I can see why. He's a champion.
6105267 6109021 Hm-hm.<br />All three are champions.
6109688 6111774 Samson's the champion.
6111940 6113734 Them other two pretty good.
6115027 6116627 Calvin, now what's<br />this nigger you let...
6116695 6117821 It's all right.
6117988 6120073 You have to understand,<br />Monsieur Candie,
6120240 6123619 while admittedly a neophyte<br />in the nigger fight game,
6123786 6128081 I do have a little bit of a background<br />in the European traveling circus.
6128248 6129333 Is that right?
6129500 6133587 Hence, I have big ideas<br />when it comes to presentation.
6133754 6134754 Hm.
6134880 6137341 I need something more<br />than just a big nigger.
6139092 6141303 Yeah, he needs to have panache.
6141470 6144556 -Need to have what? What?<br />-Panache. Uh...
6144723 6147476 -A sense of showmanship.<br />-Showmanship, yes.
6147643 6150854 I want to be able to bill him<br />as The Black Hercules.
6152815 6154191 Black Hercules,<br />isn't that clever?
6154358 6155359 More like Nigger-les.
6157820 6163200 I said, and I quote,<br />"I would pay top dollar for...
6163700 6166495 'the right nigger.'"
6166662 6170958 Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe<br />is the wrong nigger, per se.
6171124 6173836 But is he right as rain?
6175087 6176505 Oh, Dr. Schultz,
6176672 6180467 I will have you know there<br />is no one in the nigger fight game
6180634 6182553 that appreciates<br />the value of showmanship
6182719 6184471 more than Monsieur<br />Calvin J. Candie here.
6184638 6185639 Nobody.
6185806 6187686 But one must not forget<br />the most important thing
6187808 6189184 -in the nigger fight game.<br />-Hm-mm.
6189351 6191353 And that is a nigger<br />that can win fights.
6191520 6192729 Hm-mm.
6192896 6197109 Now that should be your first, second,<br />third, fourth, and fifth concern.
6197276 6199356 Now, after you have that,<br />and you know you have that,
6199486 6203448 then you can start<br />to implement a grand design.
6203615 6206159 In other words, first thing is first.
6206326 6207786 First thing's first.
6215460 6218839 Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.
6219006 6220883 Famously.
6221633 6224303 Oh, Monsieur Candie,<br />you can't imagine what it's like
6224469 6227806 not to hear your<br />native tongue in four years.
6227973 6229853 Well, hell,<br />I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.
6232227 6234271 Two weeks in Boston!
6234438 6237232 Monsieur Candie, you a mess!
6237399 6239109 Two weeks in Boston!
6239276 6244489 I can't express the joy I felt<br />conversing in my mother tongue.
6244656 6248744 And Hildi is a charming<br />conversation companion.
6248911 6250787 Well, be careful now,<br />Dr. Schultz.
6250954 6252289 You might-a caught yourself
6252456 6253816 -a little dose of nigger love.<br />-Hm!
6253874 6255959 Nigger love's<br />a powerful emotion, boy.
6256126 6258128 -Hm!<br />-It's like a pool of black tar.
6258295 6259922 Once it catches your ass, you're caught.
6260088 6263050 Yessir, you stuck.
6263216 6264760 I don't know, doctor.
6264927 6267179 You can lay on all the<br />German sweet talk you want,
6267346 6271850 but it looks like this pony's<br />got big eyes for Django.
6274269 6276730 Well, naturally.
6276897 6280525 It is the soaring eagle<br />that attracts her attention,
6280692 6283487 not the plucked chicken.
6283654 6286156 Dr. Schultz, don't be<br />so down on yourself.
6286323 6288241 You are quite the dapper<br />European gentleman.
6288408 6289594 You got to clean these dishes,
6289618 6291763 you got to put your elbow<br />in these dishes, you hear me?
6291787 6293997 You know that nigger, don't you?
6294915 6296208 -Who?<br />-"Who?"
6296375 6299461 Don't "who" me, bitch.<br />You know who I'm talkin' about.
6301213 6303215 At the table?
6303382 6304633 I don't know him.
6304800 6307844 -You don't know him.<br />-No.
6308011 6310847 -"No," what?<br />-No, sir.
6315477 6317938 You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?
6322150 6323360 Okay.
6324611 6327739 Yeah. If you say so.
6334204 6337624 Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,<br />no doubt about it.
6339001 6344172 But if it was my money,<br />I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.
6344339 6346675 What would your price be?
6346842 6348802 Well, if I was inclined<br />to be generous...
6348969 6352431 and I don't know why<br />I would be inclined to be generous...
6353390 6356643 9,000. Maybe.
6357894 6363692 Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how<br />this whole negotiation came about.
6363859 6366028 You see, it wasn't me<br />who came to you to sell a nigger.
6366194 6367194 Sure wasn't.
6367320 6369031 It was you who approached me to buy one.
6369197 6371366 -Sure was.<br />-Now, that $9,000 figure
6371533 6374095 Bright Boy's been bandyin' about,<br />that ain't too far off from right.
6374119 6375839 And if I wanted to sell<br />Eskimo Joe for that,
6375912 6378874 -I could do so any day of the week.<br />-Any day.
6379041 6383295 But, like you said in Greenville,<br />doctor... I don't want to sell him.
6383920 6387924 It was only your ridiculous<br />offer of $12,000
6388091 6390927 -that made me even consider it.<br />-Hm-mm.
6399102 6403190 You know, Monsieur Candie,<br />you do possess the power of persuasion.
6407110 6409529 Why not?<br />Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.
6409696 6413033 -Eskimo Joe, $12,000.<br />-Hooray, doctor.
6413200 6415327 Hooray.<br />And a wise decision that is.
6415494 6419039 However, that is<br />a tremendous amount of money.
6419206 6422375 And the way you have<br />your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.
6422542 6424336 Persnickety man named Tuttle.
6424503 6427589 And I would need my Mr. Tuttle<br />to draw up a legal contract
6427756 6430801 before I'd feel comfortable exchanging<br />that amount of money for flesh.
6430967 6431968 Hm-mm.
6432135 6433804 Not to mention having<br />Eskimo Joe examined
6433970 6436598 -by a physician of my choosing.<br />-Naturally.
6436765 6441478 So, say I return in about...
6443647 6445941 -five days time.<br />-Five days?
6446108 6447359 With my Mr. Tuttle.
6447526 6449569 And then my Mr. Tuttle<br />and your Mr. Moguy
6449736 6452697 can hash out the finer<br />details between themselves.
6453532 6456576 I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.
6457327 6458495 Gentlemen...
6459496 6461498 may I propose a toast.
6463875 6468755 To Eskimo Joe.<br />Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?
6468922 6471591 To The Black Hercules.
6471758 6473135 The Black Hercules.
6473301 6474719 To The Black Hercules.
6474886 6478723 You was right, doctor.<br />That name do have pan-ass.
6478890 6480308 Hm.
6480475 6483728 Hildi, top my drink off.
6486815 6491862 So, Hildi, how you like servin'<br />at the big table in The Big House, huh?
6492028 6495240 When Monsieur Candie talk to you,<br />you answers.
6495407 6498160 -I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.<br />-Hm-mm.
6498326 6501079 It's a lot better than sizzlin'<br />in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass
6501246 6502581 through a bramble bush.
6502747 6505867 But maybe it's not quite as much fun as<br />gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,
6506001 6507728 -huh, sugar bear?<br />-Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.
6507752 6508920 -Sure do.<br />-Like Samson? Huh?
6509087 6510547 No, sir.
6510714 6512048 You know, Monsieur Candie,
6512215 6515886 the doctor here might be interested<br />in seein' Hildi's peeled back,
6516052 6519306 seein' as how they don't have<br />many niggers where he come from.
6519472 6521600 Dr. Schultz,<br />when you was alone with Hildi, here,
6521766 6524811 did you just speak German<br />or did you get to take her clothes off?
6524978 6526730 No, we just talked and...
6526897 6529274 Oh, so you<br />haven't seen her back?
6529441 6531234 -I haven't...<br />-No, no, no, no.
6531401 6533445 Stephen's right,<br />you might find this interesting.
6533612 6536698 Hildi, go on, take off your dress.<br />Show Dr. Schultz your back here.
6536865 6538825 -Go on.<br />-Uh, Calvin.
6538992 6541369 I just got her all dressed up<br />and lookin' nice.
6541536 6544456 But, Lara Lee,<br />Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf.
6544623 6547626 They don't got niggers there.<br />He is a man of medicine.
6547792 6550378 I'm sure it would fascinate him,<br />the niggers' endurance for pain.
6550545 6554132 These niggers are tough,<br />Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.
6554299 6556468 Hildi's got somethin'<br />like four lashes on her back.
6556635 6558635 Lara Lee just get one,<br />she'd lose her goddamn mind.
6558762 6559989 -Sure would.<br />-Look at that, doctor.
6560013 6562265 -It's like a paintin'. Look at that.<br />-Calvin!
6563058 6566102 We are eating. Ain't no one wanna<br />look at her whipped up back.
6567771 6570190 Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.
6570357 6573026 After dinner, then, Stephen.<br />After dinner.
6574236 6576029 During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?
6582410 6583954 Cora, come get this girl!
6587415 6590627 -She a mess.<br />-Yes, ma'am. Oh!
6590794 6593255 Why are you all undone?<br />I just got you done up.
6593421 6594756 Come on in here.
6601263 6605058 Baby, you on Stephen bad side,<br />and you need to be on his blind side.
6605225 6607185 You say you ain't know him.
6608311 6609396 Huh?
6609562 6615151 I said, you said you ain't know him.
6616319 6619698 -I don't.<br />-Yes, you do.
6621866 6623493 Mr. Stephen...
6624494 6625495 I don't.
6625662 6628164 Why is you lying to me?
6630542 6631876 I ain't.
6632043 6634546 Then why is you crying?
6634713 6636881 You scarin' me.
6637048 6640969 -Why is I'm scaring you?<br />-Because you scary.
6642637 6645724 To speak German<br />this afternoon with Hildi
6645890 6649019 was positively soul-enriching.
6649185 6652063 Doctor,<br />that warms my heart to hear that.
6652230 6655066 You stay right here.
6660405 6664909 You indicated earlier<br />you'd be willing to part with Hildi.
6665076 6667912 Why, yes.<br />Yessiree bob, I did.
6669914 6675879 In that case, allow me<br />to propose another proposition.
6676046 6677422 I'm all ears.
6677589 6679299 Hurry up, goddamn it!
6679924 6681509 -Monsieur Candie...<br />-Stephen!
6682552 6685013 You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.
6686139 6688266 I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.
6688433 6691144 My ears ain't worth a damn these days.
6691311 6692437 Excuse him.
6692604 6696358 Monsieur Candie, could I get<br />a word with you in the kitchen?
6696524 6698443 You mean get up out of my chair?
6698610 6701946 -If'n you could manage it.<br />-Why?
6702113 6705950 -It's about dessert.<br />-What about dessert?
6706117 6708745 I'd rather discuss that in private.
6708912 6710789 We're having white cake!
6710955 6713291 What sort of melodrama<br />could be brewing back there?
6713458 6717796 You right, Monsieur Candie.<br />You right. I'll handle it myself.
6717962 6719756 Meet me in the library.
6719923 6723009 I just can't understand why you<br />won't come talk to these niggers.
6723176 6725053 Shit get fucked up around here,<br />you blame me.
6725220 6730225 Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,<br />I will be along momentarily.
6730392 6731559 Yessir.
6732477 6736147 Well, gentlemen, as you can see,
6736314 6738154 talented as they are,<br />no doubt, in the kitchen,
6738233 6741861 from time to time,<br />adult supervision is required.
6744864 6746658 If you'll excuse me a moment.
6752831 6754624 You may clear<br />the dinner service.
6756084 6759462 You heard him. Go on!<br />Get! Hurry up, girl.
6759629 6765051 So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you<br />regale us with a tale of the circus.
6765218 6767887 The circus?
6774352 6776146 What is the matter?
6781401 6786489 Them motherfuckers<br />ain't here to buy no Mandingos.
6786656 6790201 They wants that girl.
6790368 6793121 Stephen, what the hell<br />are you talking about? Hm?
6793288 6796458 They playing your ass for a fool<br />is what I'm talking about.
6796624 6800295 They ain't here for<br />no musclebound Jimmie.
6800462 6802630 They here for that girl.
6802797 6805425 Wh... What girl? Hildi?
6805592 6809220 Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,<br />them niggers know each other.
6810930 6812515 He just bought Eskimo Joe.
6812682 6815059 -Did he give you any money?<br />-No! Not yet. But...
6815226 6817687 Then he ain't bought diddly.<br />Not yet, nohow.
6817854 6820106 But he's just about to buy
6820273 6823485 who he come here to buy<br />when I interrupted him.
6823651 6826654 "Thank you, Stephen."<br />You're welcome, Calvin.
6832076 6834078 Where you gettin' all this?
6835205 6837141 Why would they go through<br />all that trouble for a nigger
6837165 6839667 with a chewed up back,<br />ain't worth $300?
6839834 6844130 They doin' it 'cause that nigger<br />Django's in love with Hildi.
6844297 6846132 She probably his wife.
6846299 6849093 Now, why that German gives a fuck<br />who that uppity son of a bitch
6849260 6852347 is in love with,<br />I'm sure I don't know.
6854933 6856893 If she's who they want...
6857477 6861773 why this whole snake oil pitch<br />about Mandingos, then?
6861940 6865443 You wouldn't pay no<br />never mind to no $300.
6865610 6871074 But that 12,000? That made you<br />real friendly, now, didn't it?
6873785 6875453 Yes, it did.
6878790 6880416 His wife, huh?
6884295 6888007 If it had been a snake,<br />it would have bit me.
6891302 6893304 Those lying...
6894138 6900144 goddamn time-wastin'<br />sons of bitches.
6902355 6903523 Sons of bitches!
6904148 6908945 Out of New Orleans, so I have quite<br />a bit of practice with theater types.
6910196 6911656 Oh, there you are.
6911823 6914617 I was beginning to think that you<br />and that old crow run off together.
6916411 6918580 That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?
6918746 6921833 Lara Lee, I was just<br />looking out the big window.
6922000 6925044 Billy Crash is out there<br />dealing with some shady slaver
6925211 6926438 trying to sell a passel of ponies.
6926462 6930341 Would you be a dear, go out there<br />and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?
6930508 6932760 -Of course, brother.<br />-Thank you, darling.
6946024 6949736 -Yeah. Business never sleeps.<br />-Hm-mm.
6951779 6954699 Apropos, before your exit,
6954866 6958870 we were discussing the possibility<br />of my purchasing <i>Brunhilde</i>.
6959037 6961956 Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.
6962123 6964250 And we will again. In a moment.
6980725 6982769 Who's your little friend?
6987732 6989233 This is Ben.
6990568 6995573 He's a old Joe that<br />lived around here for a long time.
6995740 6998159 And I do mean a long damn time.
6999243 7002997 Old Ben here took care of my daddy...
7003873 7005917 and my daddy's daddy.
7006084 7008670 Till he up and keeled over one day...
7011506 7013174 Old Ben took care of me.
7015760 7019555 Growing up the son of a huge<br />plantation owner in Mississippi
7019722 7025603 puts a white man in contact<br />with a whole lotta black faces.
7027230 7032527 I spent my whole life here,<br />right here in Candyland...
7033778 7037573 surrounded by black faces.
7039617 7041953 Now, seeing them every day,<br />day in, day out,
7042120 7045289 I only had one question:
7049001 7051462 Why don't they kill us?
7054465 7059637 Now, right out there on that porch,<br />three times a week for 50 years,
7059804 7064726 Old Ben here would<br />shave my daddy with a straight razor.
7064892 7070022 Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda<br />cut my daddy's goddamn throat
7070189 7073609 and it wouldn't have taken me<br />no 50 years to do it, neither.
7076154 7077655 But he never did.
7079532 7080825 Why not?
7082201 7086998 You see, the science of phrenology
7087165 7092253 is crucial to understanding<br />the separation of our two species.
7094088 7097800 In the skull of the African here,
7097967 7100094 the area associated<br />with submissiveness
7100261 7105767 is larger than any human or any other<br />subhuman species on planet Earth.
7121282 7123242 If you examine...
7124619 7126788 this piece of skull here...
7133085 7136672 you will notice<br />three distinct dimples.
7140259 7143971 Here, here and here.
7144138 7145389 Now...
7145556 7150561 if I was holding the skull<br />of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,
7150728 7153231 these three dimples would be<br />found in the area of the skull
7153397 7156734 most associated with... creativity.
7157401 7159237 But this is the skull of Old Ben.
7159862 7161989 And in the skull of Old Ben,
7162156 7164450 unburdened by genius,
7164617 7168788 these three dimples exist in the area<br />of the skull most associated with...
7169914 7171249 servility.
7172250 7174001 Now, Bright Boy...
7174919 7177088 I will admit you are pretty clever.
7179549 7181634 But if I took this hammer here...
7183761 7186097 and I bashed in your skull with it...
7187098 7192436 you would have the same<br />three dimples in the same place...
7193688 7195147 as Old Ben.
7196274 7199861 Hey! Now lay your palms<br />flat on that tabletop!
7200027 7202989 If you lift those palms<br />off that turtle shell tabletop,
7203155 7206409 Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose<br />with both barrels of that sawed-off.
7207493 7210621 There have been a lot of lies said<br />around this dinner table here tonight,
7210788 7213124 but that you can believe!
7213291 7216085 Mr. Moguy, would you be<br />so kind as to collect the pistol
7216252 7218629 hanging off these boys' hips here?
7223342 7225761 -Thank you ever so much.<br />-Doctor.
7230308 7231684 Where were we?
7236147 7237565 Jackass.
7241569 7243070 Ah, yes.
7243237 7245990 I do believe you were<br />just getting ready to make me
7246157 7248618 a proposition to buy Broomhilda.
7248784 7250161 Am I right?
7254165 7255499 Right.
7257919 7259420 Bring out Hildi!
7262173 7263716 Get over there yonder.
7265176 7267428 Sit your ass in that goddamn...
7267595 7268989 Lay your hand<br />flat on that tabletop.
7269013 7270556 Now shut your mouth!
7274852 7277438 Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,
7277605 7280358 you yourself said that<br />for the right nigger
7280524 7284862 you'd be willin' to pay what some<br />may consider is a ridiculous amount.
7285029 7288074 To which me myself said,<br />"What is your definition of ridiculous?"
7288240 7292203 To which you said, "$12,000."
7292995 7294747 Now, considering y'all
7294914 7296874 have ridden a whole lot of miles,
7297041 7301003 went through a whole lot of trouble,<br />and done spread a whole lot of bull
7301170 7303589 to purchase this<br />lovely lady right here,
7303756 7309720 it would appear that Broomhilda is,<br />in fact... the right nigger.
7309887 7313641 And if y'all want to leave<br />Candyland with Broomhilda,
7313808 7319438 the price is $12,000.
7319605 7323401 And I take it you prefer the "take it<br />or leave it" style of negotiation?
7325653 7327196 Yes, I do, doctor.
7328030 7331033 You see,<br />under the laws of Chickasaw County,
7331200 7334745 Broomhilda here is my property.
7334912 7340042 And I can choose to do with<br />my property whatever I so desire!
7341127 7343421 And if y'all think my price...
7344088 7346799 for this nigger here<br />is too steep...
7346966 7350428 what I'm gonna desire to do is...
7354348 7357476 take this goddamn hammer here<br />and beat her ass to death with it!
7357643 7359770 -Right in front of both y'all!<br />-Easy, big fella.
7359937 7364442 Then we can examine the three dimples<br />inside Broomhilda's skull!
7364608 7368779 Now, what's it gonna be, doc?<br />Huh?
7368946 7370281 What's it gonna be?
7370448 7374326 May I lift the hands off the tabletop<br />in order to remove my billfold?
7375536 7376871 Yes, you may.
7390634 7391844 That 12.
7395890 7397767 Sold!
7397933 7400478 To the man with the exceptional beard
7400644 7403981 and his unexceptional nigger.
7409820 7412114 -Mr. Moguy.<br />-Yes, Calvin?
7412281 7415951 Will you make these gentlemen<br />a receipt for $12,000, please?
7416118 7417870 $12,000.
7420998 7423167 It was a pleasure doing<br />business with y'all.
7424043 7425795 Now, gentlemen...
7427004 7428881 if you care to<br />join me in the parlor...
7429840 7432301 we will be serving white cake.
7520639 7521974 Well done, Calvin.
7524476 7527354 Excuse me.<br />Excuse me, ma'am?
7528814 7532484 Could you please stop playing Beethoven?<br />Take your hands off the harp!
7536739 7537823 Doctor!
7537990 7540618 -Doctor, you can't go in there!<br />-Stephen, Stephen.
7540784 7542095 He ain't got no business<br />going in there.
7542119 7543454 Let it be.
7543621 7545539 He's just a little upset, that's all.
7545706 7547124 I'll handle this.
7572983 7574276 White cake?
7575277 7577529 I don't go in for sweets, thank you.
7578572 7579782 Hm.
7587498 7590209 You brooding about me<br />getting the best of you, huh?
7590918 7595673 Actually, I was thinking of that<br />poor devil you fed to the dogs today.
7595839 7597675 D'Artagnan.
7598467 7602263 And I was wondering what<br />Dumas would make of all this.
7602429 7603889 Come again?
7606976 7611021 Alexandre Dumas.<br />He wrote The Three Musketeers.
7611188 7612856 Yes, of course, doctor.
7613023 7614566 I figured you must be an admirer.
7614733 7619154 You named your slave<br />after his novel's lead character.
7619321 7623033 Now, if Alexandre Dumas<br />had been there today,
7623200 7625160 I wonder what<br />he would have made of it.
7627204 7629039 You doubt he'd approve, huh?
7631250 7636422 Yes. His approval would be<br />a dubious proposition at best.
7638716 7640509 Soft-hearted Frenchie.
7642386 7644596 Alexandre Dumas is black.
7648434 7651228 -Are these <i>Brunhilde's</i> papers?<br />-Yes, they are.
7651395 7653063 -May I?<br />-Of course.
7653230 7654606 Thank you.
7656734 7659695 That is her bill of sale,<br />her ownership history,
7659862 7662031 and, of course,<br />her freedom papers, doctor.
7662197 7664408 Would you have ink and pen for me?
7665659 7668579 -Right over there on that little table.<br />-Thank you.
7689892 7691101 Thank you.
7694688 7696982 <i>Brunhilde</i> Von Shaft...
7699234 7701612 consider yourself a free woman.
7713540 7715501 Mr. Candie...
7717461 7721256 normally,<br />I would say <i>auf Wiedersehen</i>.
7721423 7725886 But since what <i>auf Wiedersehen</i> actually<br />means is "till I see you again"
7726053 7728389 and since I never<br />wish to see you again,
7728555 7733227 to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."
7737106 7738399 Let's go.
7739358 7740901 Come on.
7742611 7744696 One more moment, doctor!
7746573 7747616 What?
7752329 7754456 It's a custom here in the South...
7754957 7760337 once a business deal is concluded<br />that the two parties shake hands.
7761171 7763215 It implies good faith.
7763382 7766427 -I'm not from the South.<br />-But you are...
7766593 7768887 in my house, doctor.
7769763 7772683 -So I'm afraid I must insist.<br />-Insist?
7772850 7774852 On what?<br />That I shake your hand?
7775018 7778313 Oh, then I'm afraid<br />I must insist in the opposite direction.
7778939 7781942 -You know what I think you are?<br />-What you think I am?
7782109 7783902 No, I don't.
7785571 7790784 -I think you are a bad loser.<br />-And I think you're an abysmal winner.
7790951 7795914 Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw<br />County, a deal ain't done
7796081 7798709 until the two parties<br />have shook hands.
7799585 7802421 Even after all that paper signin',<br />don't mean shit...
7803380 7806884 you don't shake my hand.
7807843 7813515 If I don't shake your hand,<br />you're gonna throw away $12,000?
7813682 7815434 I don't think so.
7816435 7817603 Mr. Pooch?
7819438 7824151 If she tries to leave here before this<br />nigger-loving German shakes my hand,
7824318 7826069 you cut her ass down.
7848091 7851428 You really want me to shake your hand?
7853096 7854681 I insist.
7855766 7858435 If you insist.
7875035 7878038 No! Calvin!
7879122 7880707 Calvin!

8309302 8311513 We found your wanted posters...

8315725 8317352 I got to say...
8318061 8321356 I ain't never heard of<br />no black bounty hunter before.
8321523 8324567 Black boy paid to kill white men?<br />How'd you like that line of work?
8325610 8328238 Probably pretty good while it lasted,<br />huh?

8358393 8362188 Oh, and she changed her mind<br />'bout snipping Django.
8362981 8365817 She gonna give him<br />to the LeQuint Dickey people.
8367652 8369779 Well, she didn't<br />waste a minute telling me.
8377037 8378830 How disappointing.
8401770 8403104 You leavin'.
8404773 8407817 This here what you take with you.
8411196 8414657 Your black ass has been all them<br />motherfuckers at The Big House
8414824 8418244 could talk about<br />for the last few hours.
8418411 8422123 Seem like white folk ain't never<br />had a bright idea in they life
8422290 8425001 was coming up with all<br />kinds of ways to kill your ass.
8425168 8430465 Now, mind you, most of them ideas had<br />to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.
8430632 8436179 Now, that may seem like a good idea,<br />but truth is...
8437764 8440016 when you snip a nigger's nuts,
8440183 8444395 most of them bleed out in,<br />oh, about, hm... seven minutes.
8444562 8446147 Most of 'em.
8446356 8449526 Well, more than most.
8450276 8456116 Then I says: "Shitfire."
8456282 8460286 The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey<br />got it worse than that."
8461329 8464040 And they still sayin',<br />"Let's whip him to death."
8464207 8467502 Or "Throw him to the Mandingos."<br />"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."
8467669 8470880 And I said,<br />"What's so special about that?"
8471047 8473174 We do that shit all the time.
8473341 8479222 "Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to<br />LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."
8480348 8483059 Lo and behold,
8483226 8488064 out of nowhere, Miss Lara<br />come up with the bright idea
8488231 8491693 of giving your ass to the<br />LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
8494070 8499200 And as a slave of the<br />LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,
8499367 8502912 henceforth, till the day you die,

8514174 8518761 Now, when you get there,<br />they gonna take away your name,
8518928 8521848 give you a number<br />and a sledgehammer,
8522015 8524434 and say, "Get to work!"
8524601 8527020 One word of sass,<br />they cuts out your tongue.
8527187 8529522 And they good at it too.<br />You won't bleed out.

8540450 8543036 Then they're gonna hit you<br />in the head with a hammer,
8543203 8545622 throw your ass down the nigger hole.
8545788 8551169 And that will be the story of you,<br />Django.

8592835 8594963 You don't root abos.
8599717 8601177 Hey, white boy.
8602720 8604889 I said, hey, white boy.
8605056 8608142 Shut up, black. You ain't got<br />nothing to say I want to hear.
8608309 8610603 How'd you like to make $11,000?
8610770 8611938 Do what, now?
8612105 8617902 I said how'd you like to make $11,000?<br />11,500, actually.
8618069 8620029 The fuck are you talkin' about?
8620196 8624867 Back there at that plantation,<br />Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune,
8625034 8627870 just sittin' there.<br />And y'all rode right past it.
8628830 8630540 You be damned, blackie,<br />we're not bandits.
8630707 8634919 I ain't saying that. Nice thing<br />about this fortune is it ain't illegal.
8635086 8636504 You can't steal it.
8636671 8638339 You got to earn it, white boy.
8639299 8641301 You got something to say, mate,<br />you say it.
8641467 8644679 The $11,500 fortune waitin'<br />for you back at Candyland
8644846 8646973 is in the form of a<br />"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty
8647140 8649475 on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.
8649642 8651102 Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?
8651269 8654564 Smitty Bacall is the leader of this<br />murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,
8654731 8656316 the Bacall Gang.
8656482 8659736 There's a $7,000<br />"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him,
8659902 8663239 $1,500 for each<br />of his three accomplices:
8663406 8666659 Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,
8666826 8669537 and Crazy Craig Koons.
8669704 8671122 Now, all four of them gentlemen,
8671289 8673416 they back there at Candyland<br />laughing their ass off.
8673583 8677253 You know why?<br />'Cause they just got away with murder.
8677420 8678963 But it ain't got to be that way.
8679130 8682425 You and your mates, y'all can ride back<br />there and y'all can go get that money.
8682592 8683752 What'd these jokers do again?
8683843 8687347 These sons of bitches,<br />they killed innocent people.
8687513 8690767 Stagecoach robbery.<br />Innocent white people.
8691851 8694854 I got the handbill right here<br />in my pocket, if you let me get it.
8695021 8696189 Get it out.
8697940 8703196 "Wanted. Dead or alive. Smitty<br />Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang."
8703363 8704803 -But you're a slave.<br />-"For murder..."
8704864 8707367 -I ain't no goddamn slave.<br />-"...and stagecoach robbery."
8707533 8708813 Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?
8709118 8710578 -"$7,000 for Smitty Bacall."<br />-Hm?
8710745 8713539 -That's a shitload.<br />-I'm a bounty hunter.
8714957 8717543 Yesterday, as a free man,
8717710 8722256 I rode into Candyland on a horse<br />with my German white partner,
8722423 8723966 Dr. King Schultz.
8724133 8728888 We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way<br />from Texas to Chickasaw County.
8729055 8731974 We finally found their ass<br />layin' low in Candyland.
8732141 8735645 We went in there to get 'em,<br />things went sour,
8735812 8739148 my partner got killed,<br />Calvin Candie got shot,
8739315 8743486 then everybody there<br />decided to blame me, so here I am.
8745488 8747407 But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.
8747573 8750368 And all y'all know<br />I ain't supposed to be on this trip.
8750535 8753871 But them four men is still back there,<br />they're still wanted,
8754038 8757333 and that 11,500 is up for grabs,<br />and the last thing they'd expect
8757500 8759752 is y'all ridin' back in there<br />and gettin' it.
8759919 8761671 What's the deal?
8761838 8765299 You tell us who they are<br />and we turn you loose?
8765466 8768344 No, no, no, no.<br />I ain't gonna tell you who they are.
8768511 8772014 But, you give me a pistol,<br />one of them horses,
8772181 8776686 and $500 of that 11,500,<br />and I'll point 'em out to you.
8776853 8778729 This is a real handbill.
8778896 8780082 Now just 'cause it's a real handbill
8780106 8782191 doesn't mean that other<br />bunch of malarkey is.
8782358 8788281 Now why would a slave have a "Wanted<br />Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket?
8792952 8795746 Did that black ride<br />into Candyland yesterday?
8802086 8806048 All right, I'm gonna ask you again.
8807258 8809886 I want you to remember,<br />I don't like liars.
8810595 8812430 Is he a Candyland slave,
8812597 8816392 or did he ride in with a white man<br />on a horse yesterday?
8816559 8820229 Yeah. They walked us<br />from the Greenville auction,
8820396 8822940 and he rode in on a horse<br />with a white man.
8823608 8827778 Now this white man,<br />was the black his slave?
8827945 8829447 He weren't no slave.
8829614 8833451 -You fuckin' sure about that?<br />-Damn sure.
8837413 8840958 -What happened over in Candyland?<br />-Bunch-a shootin'.
8841125 8842919 Massa got shot.
8843085 8845213 -Who shot him?<br />-The German.
8845379 8846422 Why'd he do that?
8847089 8850551 Nigger and the German was actin'<br />like they were slavers but they wasn't.
8850718 8853804 -Well, what were they?<br />-Bounty hunters.
8854889 8858226 Fuck me, Roy.<br />I mean, this could be big, mate.
8859268 8862480 Well, smoke, you got a deal.

8866984 8870780 When we get there, when time come...
8872156 8875117 -you let me help you kill 'em.<br />-Hey...

8904188 8906107 with no goddamn dynamite on its back.
8906274 8908150 I can understand that.
8908317 8911153 Frankie, why don't you<br />take them sticks off that horse
8911320 8913155 and stick 'em in the nigger cage.
8914782 8916951 A little dynamite for you<br />black fellas to play with.
