258937 261624 Who's that stumbling around in the dark?
262138 265580 State your business<br />or prepare to get winged!
266309 268787 Calm yourselves, gentlemen.
268853 270530 I mean you no harm.
271356 274362 I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
274707 275889 Oh boy.
277678 279416 Good cold evening, gentlemen.
279457 281969 I'm looking for a pair of slave traders
281971 283846 that go by the name of the Speck Brothers.
283989 285074 Might that be you?
286913 287999 Who wants to know?
288208 289341 Well, I do.
289832 291980 I'm Dr. King Schultz.<br />This is my horse, Fritz.
293684 294907 What kinda doctor?
295671 296597 Dentist.
297132 298540 Now, are you the Speck Brothers?
298591 300133 And did you purchase those men
300157 301515 at the Greenville slave auction?
301552 302353 So what?
302354 304471 So I wish to parley with you.
304542 305541 Speak English.
306214 307257 Oh sorry.
307809 310019 Please forgive me.<br />It is a second language.
310186 313760 Now, amongst your inventory,<br />I've been led to believe,
313838 315914 is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.
316437 317897 Hello, you poor devils!
319028 322037 Is there one amongst you<br />who was formerly a resident
322039 324565 of the Carrucan plantation?
326014 327799 I'm from the Carrucan plantation.
329924 330803 Who said that?
378254 379369 What's your name?
383801 384853 Django.
386178 388335 Then you are exactly the one<br />I'm looking for.
390475 392195 Do you know<br />who the Brittle Brothers are?
396665 397666 Who are they?
399882 400828 Big John.
402153 402993 Ellis.
404906 405685 Roger.
406097 407165 Sometime they call him...
407572 408623 Lil Raj.
410203 412328 They was overseers<br />at the Carrucan plantation.
412580 413664 Not anymore.
416837 417794 Tell me...
418482 421454 if you were to see any of these<br />three gentlemen again,
421456 423092 would you recognize them?<br />Hey.
424284 425665 Stop talking to him like that.
425864 426714 Like What?
427296 428245 Like that.
428568 431216 My good man,<br />I'm simply trying to ascertain...
431218 432394 Speak English, goddamn it.
433230 435216 Everybody calm down.
435276 436966 I'm simply a customer,
436967 439310 trying to conduct a transaction.
439357 440219 I don't care.
440487 441984 No sale. Now, off with you.
442966 445154 Don't be ridiculous.<br />Of course they're for sale.
445879 446920 Move it.
447805 448919 My good man,
449154 452661 did you simply get carried<br />away with your dramatic gesture
452663 456056 or are you pointing your weapon at me<br />with lethal intention?
457856 459431 Last chance, fancy pants.
460878 462504 Oh, very well.
492340 494759 I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,
494793 496844 but I didn't want you to do anything rash
496846 498958 before you had a moment<br />to come to your senses.
499743 502430 You goddamn son of a bitch!
502984 505089 You shot Roscoe!<br />Well...
505673 507161 And you killed Ace!
507550 510305 I only shot your brother once<br />he threatened to shoot me.
510601 513222 And I do believe I have...<br />one, two, three, four...
513529 515141 five witnesses,
515142 516350 who can attest to that fact.
516702 518357 Damn leg's busted!
518444 519481 No doubt.
519671 522597 Now, if you could keep your<br />caterwauling down to a minimum,
522599 525405 I'd like to finish my line<br />of inquiry with young Django.
529614 531689 God-fucking-damn it!
531691 532662 As I was saying...
533413 535661 if you were to see the Brittle Brothers,
535662 537125 again you could recognize them?
537622 538489 Yeah.
539631 540924 Sold American!
540958 542177 So, Mr. Speck?
542178 544579 Mr. Speck?<br />How much for young Django here?
550366 552595 That iron is nasty business.
558222 559910 Oh, could you hold this for a moment?
562313 563347 Thank you.
563348 564121 Django?
564277 565579 Get up on that horse.
566278 567734 Also, if I were you,
568086 571896 I'd take that winter coat<br />the dear departed Speck left behind.
586128 586973 Nigger!
587197 589683 Don't you touch my brother's coat.
601539 603035 Goddamn it!
607772 609098 One hundred...
609651 610593 ten...
611294 612320 20...
612960 614448 and five...
615935 617102 for young Django here.
617233 619647 And since he won't be needing it anymore,
619649 621835 I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.
622698 623720 Also,
623926 625002 Mr. Speck,
625003 627545 I'm afraid I will require a bill of sale.
627712 628635 Do you have one?
629858 631860 You go to hell, dentist.
632968 633952 I thought not.
634930 635925 No worries.
636678 637886 I come prepared.
642482 643416 Thank you.
644429 646308 This will serve nicely,
646309 647779 as a bill of sale.
665609 668434 Now, as to you poor devils.
669567 670850 So, as I see it,
671641 674033 when it comes to the subject<br />of what to do next,
674423 675908 you gentlemen have...
675909 677038 two choices.
677507 678082 One.
678730 679808 Once I'm gone,
680238 682786 you could lift that beast<br />off the remaining Speck,
682788 684477 then carry him to the nearest town.
684747 687937 Which would be at least<br />37 miles back the way you came.
688535 689340 Or two.
690699 692327 You could unshackle yourselves,
692998 694070 take that rifle,
694394 695572 put a bullet in his head,
695768 697090 bury the two of them deep,
697262 700493 and then make your way to a more<br />enlightened area of this country.
701694 702709 Choice is yours.
703591 707474 And on the off chance there are<br />any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
707528 709973 the North Star is that one.
712055 712883 Tada.
730044 731476 Now wait a minute, fellas.
731645 733305 Let's talk about this!
737613 740907 You got to be reasonable<br />in a situation like this!
742493 745496 I'm not a bad guy.<br />I'm just doing my job!
745663 746618 Blueberry,
747132 749104 didn't I give you my last apple?
749660 750699 Tell you what, boys.
750916 752533 Take me to the doc in El Paso,
752877 754263 I'll get you your freedom.
754903 756357 No. No, please...
803846 805222 Alright, now.
805389 807642 I'd like you to take two of these tonight,
808159 809485 and then in the morning...
812208 813558 That's a nigger on a horse.
839518 840935 What's everybody staring at?
841461 843481 They ain't never seen<br />no nigger on a horse before.
867117 868861 Good morning, innkeeper!
870698 872776 Two beers for two weary travelers.
872944 874833 It's still a bit early.
875191 877141 We won't be open for another hour.
877797 879494 By then, we'll be serving breakfast.
882646 884906 What the hell you think you're doing, boy?
885177 886786 Get that nigger outta here!
892270 894075 Help! Help!
894140 895131 Innkeeper!
895490 896383 Remember,
896384 898350 get the sheriff, not the marshal.
898710 900357 Sheriff! Help!
900835 901681 Alas.
903362 905906 Now we must act as our own bartender.
908325 909873 Sit down, my boy.
920019 921348 What kind of dentist are you?
923465 928053 Despite that cart, I haven't<br />practiced dentistry in five years.
932987 935192 But these days,<br />I practice a new profession...
938461 939503 bounty hunter.
946374 947882 Do you know what a bounty hunter is?
948699 949413 No.
949767 950602 Well...
952745 956874 the way the slave trade<br />deals in human lives for cash,
957041 959223 a bounty hunter deals in corpses.
960713 961246 Hat.
965507 966372 Prost.
975428 978104 The state places a bounty<br />on a man's head.
978187 981184 I track that man, I find that man,<br />I kill that man.
981186 985190 After I've killed him, I transport that<br />man's corpse back to the authorities.
985575 987700 Sometimes that's easier said than done.
987905 990089 I show that corpse<br />to the authorities,
990090 992576 proving yes, indeed,<br />I truly have killed him,
992743 995197 at which point the authorities<br />pay me the bounty.
995913 996465 So,
996926 999573 like slavery,<br />it's a flesh for cash business.
1000876 1001924 What's a bounty?
1005673 1007132 It's like a reward.
1007798 1008904 You kill people?
1009261 1010399 And they give you a reward?
1011399 1012721 Certain people, yeah.
1013106 1014058 Bad people?
1015530 1017306 Badder they are, bigger the reward.
1018443 1019777 Which brings me to you.
1020771 1023993 And I must admit, I'm at a bit of<br />a quandary when it comes to you.
1025431 1027611 On one hand, I despise slavery.
1027937 1029297 On the other hand,
1030177 1031219 I need your help.
1031221 1033771 If you're not in a position to refuse,<br />all the better.
1035425 1036644 So, for the time being,
1036645 1039522 I'm gonna make this slavery<br />malarkey work to my benefit.
1040541 1041324 Still,
1041810 1042844 having said that,
1044111 1045118 I feel guilty.
1046944 1047740 So,
1048766 1052136 I would like the two of us<br />to enter into an agreement.
1059371 1060964 I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.
1065785 1067422 However, at this endeavor,
1067496 1069295 I'm at a slight disadvantage,
1069829 1071877 insofar as I don't know<br />what they look like.
1073900 1074902 But you do.
1075730 1076452 Don't ya?
1077019 1078617 I know what they look like alright.
1079188 1079853 Good.
1080525 1081982 So here's my agreement.
1082868 1085673 You travel with me until we find them.<br />Where we going?
1086323 1089139 I hear at least two of them<br />are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,
1089148 1090423 but I don't know where.
1091468 1094059 That means we visit every plantation
1094060 1095764 in Gatlinburg till we find them.
1095846 1097314 And when we find them,
1098338 1099609 you point them out,
1099610 1100732 and I kill them.
1102258 1103300 You do that,
1104108 1105776 I agree to give you your freedom,
1105854 1108365 $25 per Brittle Brother.
1108366 1109678 That's $75.
1110171 1112242 And as if on cue,
1112243 1113697 here comes the sheriff.
1121455 1123090 Ok, boys.
1123394 1124484 Fun's over.
1125862 1126838 Come on out.
1130509 1132066 Alright folks,
1132815 1134176 calm down.
1135219 1136670 Go about your business.
1138123 1139998 These jokers will be gone soon.
1142167 1142987 Now,
1143557 1146675 why you all wanna come<br />into my town and start trouble?
1148820 1150768 Scare all these nice people.
1152248 1154493 You ain't got nothing better to do,
1155184 1158282 than to come into Bill Sharp's town
1158422 1160684 and show your ass?
1169366 1171098 What'd you just do to our sheriff?
1184234 1185910 Now you can get the marshal.
1188083 1189227 Marshal!
1189313 1190261 Marshal!
1190440 1191648 Should we wait inside?
1191754 1192751 Can we just leave?
1192860 1193707 After you.
1196652 1200168 Move that buckboard a long ways<br />across the street from the saloon.
1200909 1203236 I want six men, six rifles behind it.
1204085 1206326 I want two men,<br />two rifles up on this roof.
1206446 1208114 Two men, two rifles on that roof.
1208792 1210976 All the barrels aimed at that front door.
1212225 1214753 Somebody get poor Bill<br />outta the goddamn street.
1216091 1217223 You in the saloon!
1218692 1221528 We got a hundred rifles aimed<br />at every way out of that building.
1222565 1225029 You got one chance<br />to get out of this alive.
1226476 1229164 You and your nigger come out right now<br />with your hands over your head,
1229173 1230658 and I mean right now.
1232232 1235652 Is this the marshal I have<br />the pleasure of addressing?
1236253 1237230 Yes, it is.
1237993 1239865 This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.
1240274 1242023 Na wunderbar, marshal.
1242826 1246413 I have relieved myself of all weapons,
1246979 1249554 and just as you have instructed,
1249789 1252336 I am ready to step outside
1252718 1254162 with my hands,
1254163 1256362 raised above my head.
1257949 1260359 I trust as a representative
1260361 1263897 of the criminal justice system<br />of the United States of America,
1264025 1265911 I shan't be shot down
1266060 1269809 in the street by either<br />you or your deputies
1270005 1272648 before I've had my day in court.
1273119 1274680 You mean like you did our sheriff.
1275317 1277110 Shot him down like a dog in the street.
1277277 1279613 Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
1279780 1281979 Do I have your word as a lawman,
1282061 1285300 not to shoot me down<br />like a dog in the street?
1288789 1289553 Well,
1289742 1292495 much as we'd all enjoy<br />seeing something like that,
1292497 1295086 ain't nobody gonna cheat<br />the hangman in my town.
1296371 1297719 Fair enough, marshal.
1297861 1298962 Here we come.
1300925 1303005 They're a little tense out there.
1303464 1306632 So don't make any quick movements,<br />and let me do the talking.
1308611 1309609 Come ahead.
1316900 1317994 You unarmed?
1318318 1319479 Yes, indeed we are.
1320779 1321706 Marshal Tatum,
1321761 1324596 may I address you<br />and your deputies,
1324598 1326579 and apparently the entire town<br />of Daughtrey,
1326581 1328665 as to the incident that just occurred?
1330080 1331150 Go on.<br />Thank you.
1332995 1335138 My name is Dr. King Schultz.
1335248 1338183 Like yourself marshal,<br />I'm a servant of the court.
1338697 1340378 The man lying dead in the dirt,
1340845 1344204 who the good people of Daughtrey<br />saw fit to elect as their sheriff,
1344509 1346218 who went by the name of Bill Sharp,
1346428 1350469 is actually a wanted outlaw<br />by the name of Willard Peck,
1351018 1353603 with a price on his head of $200.
1353863 1356468 Now that's $200, dead or alive.
1357087 1358233 The hell you say!
1358754 1362260 I'm aware this is probably<br />disconcerting news.
1362768 1364097 But I'm willing to wager,
1364351 1365836 this man was elected sheriff
1366277 1368109 sometime in the past two years?
1369839 1370370 Yeah.
1370537 1372875 I know this, because three years ago,
1372876 1374888 he was rustling cattle from the B.C.
1374889 1377586 Corrigan Cattle Company<br />of Lubbock, Texas.
1378110 1379053 Now this,
1379347 1380708 is a warrant,
1380985 1383331 made out by Circuit Court Judge,
1383603 1387085 Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.
1387734 1389262 You're encouraged to wire him.
1389510 1391204 He'll back up who I am,
1391657 1394071 and who your dear<br />departed sheriff was.
1402816 1404125 In other words marshal,
1404852 1406457 you owe me $200.
1415248 1416496 I'll be damned.
1445086 1447434 After this Brittle business is behind us,
1448879 1450148 you'll be a free man,
1450709 1451686 with a horse,
1452030 1454203 $75 in your back pocket...
1457006 1458291 What's your plan after that?
1460802 1461724 Find my wife,
1463227 1464256 and buy her freedom.
1466790 1467835 Django,
1469105 1471198 I had no idea you were a married man.
1472383 1474307 Do most slaves believe in marriage?
1475953 1477166 Me and my wife do.
1478376 1480165 Old Man Carrucan didn't,<br />that's why were.
1481450 1482271 We run off.
1483724 1485032 Django.
1485902 1487770 Django, Django.
1488529 1490783 You got sand, Django.
1492214 1493698 Boy's got sand.
1495935 1498806 I got no use for a nigger with sand.
1500584 1503671 I want you to burn a runaway R<br />right here on his cheek.
1504488 1505531 And the girl, too.
1507424 1510140 And I want you to take them<br />to the Greenville auction,
1510872 1512058 and sell them.
1513054 1514049 Both of them.
1515267 1516486 Separately.
1519470 1520471 And this one...
1523273 1525424 you will sell him cheap.
1527944 1529265 In Greenville...
1532161 1534953 there should be some<br />sort of a records office.
1542268 1543898 You know when she was sold...
1545939 1547959 you know where she came from,
1549129 1550420 and you know her name.
1551688 1552732 What is her name?
1553880 1554777 Broomhilda.
1556556 1557269 What?
1557922 1559133 Broom-hilda.
1560156 1561249 Broomhilda?
1564341 1565463 Were her owners German?
1566021 1567067 Yeah, how you know?
1568095 1569856 She wasn't born on<br />the Carrucan plantation.
1569858 1571116 She was raised by a German mistress,
1571210 1572097 the Von Shafts.
1572383 1573747 She speak a little German, too.
1574491 1575963 Your wife?
1576510 1578565 When she was little, her mistress<br />taught her so she'd have somebody
1578567 1579607 to speak German with.
1581581 1583456 Well, let me get this straight.
1584334 1587133 Your slave wife speaks German,
1587134 1588922 and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?
1589089 1589849 Yep.
1594378 1595971 They call me Hilda.
1613697 1616776 When we gain access<br />to these plantations,
1617261 1619050 we'll be putting on an act.
1620620 1622940 You'll be playing a character.
1632294 1632997 No?
1640801 1642152 During the act,
1642262 1644763 you can never break character.
1646288 1647292 Do you understand?
1648356 1649123 Yeah.
1649525 1650900 Don't break character.
1653396 1656661 And your character is that of The Valet.
1657907 1658837 What that is?
1660461 1662223 That's a fancy word for servant.
1662871 1663841 Valet?
1665623 1667117 And now Django,
1667454 1669752 you may choose your<br />character's costume.
1672624 1674459 Youse gonna let me<br />pick out my own clothes?
1674549 1675732 But of course.
1709954 1713634 It's against the law for niggers<br />to ride horses in this territory.
1713822 1716372 This is my valet.<br />My valet does not walk.
1717294 1721164 I said niggers on horses...<br />His name is Django.
1721214 1722503 He's a free man.
1722504 1724009 He can ride what he pleases.
1724099 1725439 Not on my property.
1725887 1727560 Not around my niggers, he can't.
1728444 1729835 My good sir,
1730973 1732932 perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.
1733400 1735753 Allow me to unring this bell.
1736229 1738161 My name is Dr. King Schultz.
1738224 1739864 This is my valet, Django.
1740031 1742226 And these are our horses,<br />Tony and Fritz.
1745995 1746992 Mr. Bennett?
1747539 1749373 I've been led to believe,
1749374 1750905 that you are a gentleman,
1750906 1752289 and a businessman.
1752446 1756318 And it is for these attributes<br />we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee
1756320 1757694 to parley with you now.
1759105 1762297 I wish to purchase one<br />of your nigger gals.
1764639 1766189 You and your Jimmie,
1766190 1768188 rode from Texas to Tennessee
1768190 1769686 to buy one of my nigger gals?
1770013 1771396 No appointment, no nothing?
1771986 1773402 Oh, I'm afraid so.
1774021 1776293 Well, what if I was to say I don't like you?
1776660 1778167 Or your fancy-pants nigger?
1778272 1780281 And I would not sell you a tinker's damn.
1781149 1782635 Now what you got to say about that?
1785923 1787154 Mr. Bennett.
1788361 1791428 If you are the businessman<br />I've been led to believe you to be,
1791780 1792661 I have,
1792662 1796282 5,000 things I might say<br />that could change your mind.
1800906 1804130 Well, come on inside and get<br />yourself something cool to drink.
1818735 1819697 Oh, maybe,
1819698 1821764 while we discuss business,<br />you could provide
1821765 1823656 one of your loveliest black creatures
1823658 1826097 to escort Django here<br />around your magnificent grounds.
1826117 1827470 Oh, well, absolutely.
1827960 1828606 Betina.
1828673 1829626 Yessir, Big Daddy?
1830496 1831861 What's your Jimmie's name again?
1832415 1833917 Django.<br />Django.
1834083 1835020 Betina sugar,
1835260 1836599 could you take Django there
1836601 1839513 and take him around the grounds here<br />and show him all the pretty stuff.
1839962 1841255 As you please, Big Daddy.
1841257 1842238 Oh, Mr. Bennett,
1842848 1843978 I must remind you,
1844144 1845343 Django is a free man.
1845345 1847147 He cannot be treated like a slave.
1847148 1849033 He... within the bounds of good taste,
1849035 1851219 he must be treated<br />as an extension of myself.
1851712 1852881 Understood, Schultz.
1852882 1854521 Betina, sugar?<br />Yes'm?
1854687 1856687 Django isn't a slave.
1857297 1859317 Django is a free man, you understand?
1860714 1863125 You can't treat him like any<br />of the other niggers around here,
1863127 1865245 because he ain't like any of<br />the other niggers around here.
1865246 1866047 You got it?
1866407 1868727 You want I should treat him<br />like white folks?
1869264 1869815 No.
1871061 1872247 That's not what I said.
1872512 1874401 Then I don't know what you want,<br />Big Daddy.
1875458 1876105 Yes,
1876800 1877850 I can see that.
1880581 1882167 What's the name of<br />that peckerwood boy
1882270 1884066 from town that works with the glass?
1884984 1886719 His mama work over at the lumberyard.
1887142 1888279 Oh, you mean Jerry.
1888280 1889894 That's the boy's name. Jerry!
1890074 1891472 You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?
1891474 1892670 Yes'm, Big Daddy.
1893115 1894310 Well, that's it, then.
1895057 1897303 You just treat him like you would Jerry.
1904531 1907490 That house we just left from<br />is The Big House.
1907769 1910225 Big Daddy call it that because it's big.
1911661 1913959 That there is the pantry.
1914162 1916790 That's where Big Daddy<br />hang all his dead meat.
1917737 1919199 Po' little squirrels.
1921421 1922965 What you do for your massa?
1924177 1925978 Didn't you hear him<br />tell you I ain't no slave?
1926034 1928453 So you really free?<br />Yes, I's free.
1928511 1930584 You mean you wanna dress like that?
1932986 1934278 Betina, I need to ask you something.
1934279 1935388 What you want?
1935390 1937226 I'm looking for three white men.
1937468 1938717 Three brothers. Overseers.

1947042 1948089 I don't know them.
1949169 1950542 They could be using a different name.
1951117 1953133 They woulda come to the plantation<br />this past year.
1953661 1954987 You mean the Shaffers?

2257006 2258196 That's Big John.
2258785 2259910 That's Lil Raj.
2260238 2261270 Where's Ellis?
2261844 2264180 He's the one high tailing it<br />across that field right now.
2269018 2270519 You sure that's him?<br />Yeah.
2270834 2272521 Positive?<br />I don't know.
2272772 2275106 You don't know if you're positive?<br />I don't know what positive mean.
2275191 2276557 It means you're sure.<br />Yes.
2276718 2278744 Yes, what?<br />Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.
2292124 2293519 I'm positive he dead.
2298756 2299757 Django!
2301760 2304292 Everybody calm down.
2304363 2306372 We mean no one else any harm.
2306555 2308099 Who are you two jokers?
2308526 2310296 I am Dr. King Schultz,
2310326 2311433 a legal representative
2311435 2314541 of the criminal justice system of<br />the United States of America.
2314564 2315665 The man to my left,
2315666 2318268 is Django Freeman.<br />He's my deputy.
2319095 2320778 In my pocket is a warrant,
2321153 2325523 signed by Circuit Court Judge<br />Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,
2325687 2327558 for the arrest and capture,
2327559 2329270 dead or alive,
2329586 2331450 of John Brittle,
2331917 2334458 Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.
2334625 2336198 They were going by the name Shaffer.
2338129 2342258 You know them by the name of Shaffer,<br />but the butchers' real name, was Brittle.
2342631 2344093 These are wanted men.
2344338 2345798 The law wants them for murder.
2346040 2347285 Now I reiterate,
2347697 2350419 the warrant states dead or alive,
2350426 2353708 so when Mr. Freeman and myself<br />executed these men on sight,
2353963 2357127 we were operating<br />within our legal boundaries.
2358232 2359389 I realize,
2360127 2361843 passions are high,
2363019 2364469 but I must warn you,
2365103 2367163 the penalty for taking deadly force
2367165 2370390 against an officer of the court in<br />the performance of his duty is...
2370976 2373017 you'll be hung by<br />the neck until you're dead.
2376856 2381006 Now, may I please remove the warrant<br />from my pocket so you may examine it?
2383299 2384122 Gve me.
2400983 2402137 Satisfied?
2409167 2410648 May I have that back, please?
2416832 2417793 Get off my land.
2418458 2419575 Posthaste.
2420650 2423517 Load up the bodies<br />as quickly as you can
2423518 2424813 and let's get outta here.
2450783 2451775 Yeah,
2452463 2454072 that's them sons-a-bitches.
2494326 2495578 Come on, men!
2497788 2499607 We're coming for you, nigger!
2510669 2512455 Now, unless they start shooting first,
2513491 2514571 nobody shoot them.
2515565 2517488 That's way too simple for these jokers.
2518247 2520820 We're gonna whup that nigger-lover to death.
2521117 2525231 And I'm gonna personally<br />strip and clip that garboon myself.
2529910 2530618 Damn.
2532414 2534704 I can't see fucking shit outta this thing.
2535711 2537161 We ready or what?
2537423 2539705 Hold on,<br />I'm fucking with my eyeholes.
2541603 2542249 Oh shit.
2543056 2544734 I just made it worse.
2544793 2546935 Who made this goddamn shit?
2547004 2548101 Willard's wife.
2548102 2549965 Well, make your own goddamn masks!
2550132 2550792 Look,
2550938 2553771 nobody's saying they don't<br />appreciate what Jenny did.
2553773 2556359 Well, if all I had to do<br />was cut a hole in a bag,
2556639 2558555 I coulda cut it better than this!
2558567 2559854 What about you, Robert?
2559855 2560910 Can you see?
2561435 2562645 Not too good.
2562728 2563595 I mean,
2563811 2566275 if I don't move my head<br />I can see you pretty good,
2566345 2567235 more or less.
2567316 2569599 But when I start riding,<br />the bag's moving all over,
2569600 2570819 and I'm riding blind.
2571220 2572105 Shit.<br />Yeah.
2573637 2575222 I just made mine worse.
2576116 2577314 Oh, God.
2577409 2578953 Anybody bring any extra bags?
2579017 2579741 No!
2579845 2582081 Nobody brought an extra bag.
2582478 2584015 I'm just asking.
2584041 2585999 Do we have to wear them when we ride?
2586071 2587428 Oh, well, shitfire!
2587543 2590629 If you don't wear them as you ride up,<br />that just defeats the purpose!
2590631 2592474 Well, I can't see in this fucking thing!
2592758 2595626 I can't breathe in this fucking thing<br />and I can't ride in this fucking thing!
2595636 2597736 Well, fuck all you all! I'm going home!
2598300 2602256 Now, I watched my wife work all day<br />getting 30 bags together
2602293 2604295 for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,
2604501 2607809 and all I can hear is criticize,<br />criticize, criticize!
2608274 2609256 From now on,
2609370 2611443 don't ask me or mine for nothing!
2612736 2613627 Now look,
2614154 2615777 let's not forget why we're here.
2615946 2618490 We got a killer nigger<br />over that hill there!
2619127 2620462 And we got to make<br />a lesson out of him.
2620536 2621911 Ok, I'm confused.
2622160 2623810 Are the bags on or off?
2624791 2625889 I think,
2626318 2627536 we all think,
2627918 2629568 the bag was a nice idea.
2629701 2630462 Yeah.
2630839 2632534 But, not pointing any fingers,
2633415 2634717 they coulda been done better.
2636039 2637200 So, how about...
2637605 2639080 no bags this time,
2639720 2640859 but next time,
2641231 2642410 we do the bags right,
2642548 2643798 and then we go,
2643799 2644725 full regalia.
2644727 2647180 I like that idea a lot.<br />You get my vote, Robert.
2647182 2648079 Wait a minute!
2648611 2650093 I didn't say no bags.
2650700 2652161 But nobody can see.
2652947 2653761 So?
2653980 2655696 So it'd be nice to see.
2656238 2657398 Goddamn it!
2657511 2658592 This is a raid!
2658900 2660891 I can't see, you can't see!
2661125 2661967 So what?
2662170 2664357 All that matters is can<br />the fucking horse see!
2664823 2665863 That's a raid!
2668250 2669657 Sons of bitches!
2669918 2671331 I can't see shit!
2671795 2673073 There he is!
2673399 2675649 Get that nigger out from<br />under that wagon!
2676443 2678260 And get that nigger lover<br />outta the wagon!
2678380 2680261 That nigger ain't down here,<br />Big Daddy!
2680290 2681708 What?<br />They tricked us!
2681805 2682848 Well, where are they?
2683015 2684308 Auf Wiedersehen.
2692107 2693150 Bull's-eye.
2696153 2697216 Look at them run.
2702171 2704382 Yeah, cowards tend to do that.
2704828 2706600 Goddamn it!
2712920 2714171 Goddamn it!
2718801 2719902 Would you care to?
2727309 2728806 Can't see shit outta this!
2729668 2731685 He's getting away.<br />I got him.
2733982 2735508 Big Daddy's getting away.
2735609 2736576 I got him.
2752126 2752991 Got him.
2759173 2760678 The kid's a natural.
2771900 2773927 How you know Broomhilda's<br />first masters was German?
2775814 2777352 Broomhilda is a German name.
2778068 2780455 If they named her,<br />it stands to reason they'd be German.
2781242 2783014 Lots of gals where you're from<br />named Broomhilda?
2783834 2785026 Broomhilda,
2785351 2786990 is the name of a character
2787119 2788275 in the most,
2788276 2790525 popular of all the German legends.
2791370 2792637 There's a story about Broomhilda?
2793333 2794439 Oh, yes, there is.
2801246 2802147 Do you know it?
2802515 2804318 Oh, every German knows that story.
2810976 2812352 Would you like me to tell you?
2813972 2814668 Well,
2816035 2816959 Broomhilda,
2817287 2818160 was a...
2818785 2819835 princess.
2821695 2823503 She was a daughter of Wotan,
2824222 2825733 god of all gods.
2826825 2827703 Anyway,
2827940 2830037 her father is really mad at her.
2830204 2831189 What she do?
2832531 2833991 I can't exactly remember.
2834041 2836236 She disobeys him in some way.
2836877 2839863 So he puts her on top of the mountain.
2840714 2841840 Broomhilda's on a mountain?
2842007 2843414 It's a German legend,
2843416 2845817 there is always going to be<br />a mountain in there somewhere.
2846386 2850114 And he puts a fire-breathing dragon<br />there to guard the mountain.
2852100 2854253 And he surrounds her,
2854933 2856890 in a circle of hellfire.
2858649 2859719 And there,
2860782 2862662 Broomhilda shall remain.
2864279 2865549 Unless,
2865808 2869339 a hero arises brave enough to save her.
2870661 2871886 Does a fella arise?
2872412 2873695 Yes Django,
2873696 2875234 as a matter of fact he does.
2875541 2877584 A fella named Siegfried.
2878293 2879571 Does Siegfried save her?
2881971 2883812 Quite spectacularly so.
2885133 2886843 He scales the mountain,
2887517 2889263 because he's not afraid of it.
2890103 2891418 He slays the dragon,
2891889 2893483 because he's not afraid of him.
2894445 2896578 And he walks through hellfire...
2899280 2900993 because Broomhilda's worth it.
2905654 2906925 I know how he feel.
2908782 2911183 I think I'm just starting to realize that.
2917165 2917899 Now,
2918532 2919284 look,
2920284 2921026 Django...
2924411 2927981 I don't doubt that one day<br />you'll save your lady love...
2929225 2932561 but I can't let you go<br />to Greenville in a good conscience.
2934222 2936504 A slave auction town in Mississippi
2936505 2938229 isn't the place for you to visit.
2938687 2939833 Free or not,
2939835 2941183 it's just too dangerous.
2944682 2946225 But let me ask you a question.
2954202 2956208 How do you like<br />the bounty hunting business?
2958333 2960044 Kill white folks and they pay you for it?
2961410 2962365 What's not to like?
2962794 2964970 Now I have to admit,<br />we make a good team.
2965535 2967930 I thought you was mad at me<br />for killing Big John and Lil Raj.
2968375 2970727 Yeah, on that occasion<br />you were a tad overzealous,
2970729 2972140 but normally, that's a good thing.
2973473 2975684 How'd you like to partner up<br />for the winter?
2975985 2977113 What you mean partner up?
2978186 2981721 You work with me through the winter<br />till the snow melts...
2983332 2985483 I give you a third of my bounties.
2986443 2988519 So we make some money this winter,
2988629 2990144 and when the snow melts,
2990977 2993037 I'll take you to Greenville myself,
2993818 2996388 and we'll find where they sent your wife.
3001083 3002586 Why you care what happen to me?
3004703 3006140 Why you care if I find my wife?
3006713 3007671 Frankly...
3009796 3012260 I've never given anybody<br />their freedom before.
3012473 3013710 And now that I have,
3013711 3016033 I feel vaguely<br />responsible for you.
3017516 3020765 Plus when a German meets a real life<br />Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.
3023772 3026876 As a German, I'm obliged<br />to help you on your quest
3026887 3028952 to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
3158794 3159795 You got her.
3167840 3170795 What happened to Mr. I Wanna<br />Shoot White Folks For Money?
3171628 3172889 His son's with him.
3173218 3174132 Well, good.
3174669 3176055 He'll have a loved one with him.
3176375 3178430 Maybe even share a last word.
3180762 3182623 That's better than most of them get.
3182973 3184754 Damn sight better than he deserves.
3193333 3194551 Put down the rifle.
3197521 3199040 Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.
3200156 3202491 Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
3206580 3207885 Read it aloud.
3208957 3210750 Consider that today's lesson.
3213278 3215483 Wanted. Dead or alive.
3217055 3219923 Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall g...
3221192 3222357 Gang.<br />Gang.
3223305 3226784 For murder and stagecoach...
3228393 3229304 Robbery.
3230103 3232898 Seven-zero-zero-zero..<br />Seven thousand.
3233353 3234197 Thousand.
3234831 3235807 Seven thousand
3236047 3236905 Dollars,
3237180 3238564 for Smitty Bacall.
3238945 3239793 One...
3240286 3242936 thousand and five hundred dollars for...
3243101 3244042 each of his...
3244543 3245343 gang...
3247198 3248350 Mem...<br />Members.
3249748 3254004 Known members of the Smitty Bacall<br />Gang are as follas.
3254449 3256006 Follows.<br />Follows.
3256758 3258085 Dandy Michaels,
3258234 3259542 Gerald Nash and...
3261480 3262568 Crazy Craig Koons.
3264220 3265239 That is...
3265489 3266577 who Smitty Bacall is.
3267164 3269818 If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at 22,
3269934 3271744 they would never have printed that.
3272354 3275774 But Smitty Bacall<br />wanted to rob stagecoaches
3276253 3278466 and he didn't mind killing people to do it.
3279331 3280894 Do you want to save your wife,
3281137 3282414 by doing what I do?
3283779 3284955 This is what I do.
3285381 3286582 I kill people,
3286583 3288570 and sell their corpses for cash.
3289855 3292800 This corpse is worth $7,000.
3293667 3295766 Now quit your pussyfooting<br />and shoot him.
3306012 3306762 Pa?
3307648 3308424 Pa!
3317357 3318331 Here.
3319234 3321319 You need to keep<br />this Smitty Bacall handbill.
3321486 3322061 Why?
3322357 3323388 It's good luck.
3323738 3326024 You always keep the handbill<br />of your first bounty.
3374456 3376006 That's accurate.
3444192 3445761 Doctor, Django,
3445763 3446994 how the hell are you?
3448556 3450095 Who the hell-a you got there?
3450863 3452453 The Wilson-Lowe Gang.
3453085 3455701 Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?
3456762 3459472 Bad Chuck Wilson<br />and meaner Bobby Lowe
3459773 3461044 and three of their acolytes.
3462808 3465089 Well, just leave them out here,<br />they ain't going nowhere.
3465308 3467524 Why don't you come in then<br />out of the snowy snow
3467723 3469021 and get yourselves some coffee.
3469592 3472137 We had a birthday yesterday.<br />Got some cake.
3472591 3473636 Pretty good.
3507172 3508423 Keep moving.
3508590 3510550 Get on up on that auction block.
3512093 3514470 Don't let that mud slow you down.<br />Keep going.
3530904 3532155 Keep going!
3534616 3536418 Broomhilda Von Shaft.
3536662 3537927 Age 27.
3538703 3540121 'R' on right cheek.
3541927 3544042 Calvin Candie.
3544302 3547565 He owns the fourth biggest<br />cotton plantation in Mississippi.
3547566 3548723 Candyland.
3549015 3549980 Candyland?
3550518 3551602 Oh, so you've heard of it.
3551642 3553316 Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
3553801 3556163 Well apparently,<br />that's where your wife is...
3556638 3559182 and that's the repellant gentleman<br />who owns her.
3559613 3562043 Let's just hope she works in<br />the house, not in the field.
3562294 3563663 Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.
3564479 3566175 She... She pretty.
3567335 3568787 And she talk good, too.
3570652 3572493 But when they tore her back up<br />and then they...
3573834 3575439 burned that runaway r on her cheek...
3577242 3578409 they goddamned her.
3583122 3584828 She ain't no field nigger<br />but she ain't good enough
3584830 3586016 for the house no more either.
3586834 3588399 They gonna try to make her a comfort girl.
3588497 3589469 What's a comfort?
3591089 3592516 Not while I got freedom.
3593967 3595440 Not while I got my gun.
3598846 3600360 So do we offer to buy her?
3603340 3604334 So...
3606339 3607224 say...
3609983 3610990 a man,
3611271 3612680 wants to buy a horse.
3613243 3614884 Needs to buy a horse.
3616529 3618094 He walks up to the farmer's farm,
3618110 3619490 and he knocks on the farmer's door
3619492 3621395 and asks the farmer to buy his horse.
3621397 3623191 And do you know what the farmer says?
3623288 3625239 The farmer says, no.
3627115 3629354 Well, I say fuck that farmer,
3629986 3631358 and I'm stealing that horse.
3632130 3634744 Fair enough.<br />But now you're a horse thief,
3634745 3636385 and they hang horse thieves.
3636591 3638852 Not to mention the horse goes back<br />to its original owner,
3638854 3640511 because the horse is still his property.
3640778 3641867 We need her,
3642235 3643073 and...
3643321 3644407 we need a bill of sale.
3644559 3646512 Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her,<br />then how we gonna get her?
3648183 3651609 May I offer an alternative plan of action?
3651777 3652872 Go ahead.
3653659 3654202 So...
3655455 3656484 the man,
3656784 3658185 walks up to the farmer's farm,
3658235 3659778 he knocks on the farmer's door...
3660540 3662065 and asks,
3662066 3663592 not to buy the horse,
3664112 3665536 but the farm.
3665538 3669334 And makes an offer so ridiculous,
3669481 3672025 the farmer is forced to say yes.
3672878 3674675 We gonna offer to buy Candyland?
3674676 3675822 No, it's far too big.
3675907 3678715 But apparently this farmer<br />ain't all about the farm.
3680667 3682711 How much do you know<br />about Mandingo fighting?
3682753 3683427 What?
3683835 3686914 Can you convincingly<br />masquerade as someone
3686916 3688809 who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?
3688840 3689548 Why?
3690204 3691641 Because my character
3691642 3694006 is that of a big money buyer<br />from Dusseldorf,
3694009 3695851 here in Greenville to buy my way
3695887 3697273 into the Mandingo fight game.
3697430 3698914 And your character
3698953 3701361 is a Mandingo expert<br />I hired to help me do it.
3701445 3702995 They call that One-Eyed Charley.
3706597 3707713 Bonjour.<br /><font color="#00ffff"><i>Good morning</i></font>

3714109 3715528 Entraz.
3718049 3719509 Thank you.
3720551 3722462 You want me to play a black slaver?
3723570 3725357 Ain't nothing lower than a black slaver.
3726337 3729252 A black slaver is lower<br />than the head house nigger...
3730443 3732146 and buddy, that's pretty fucking low.
3733791 3735675 Then play him that way.
3735733 3737574 Give me your...
3737887 3739730 black slaver.

3753209 3754856 Good to see you again!
3754857 3756421 Mr. Moguy.
3756519 3759653 Thank you for your assistance<br />in creating the opportunity
3759690 3761989 for this appointment.<br />Nonsense, it's my job.
3762611 3765558 So this is the One-Eyed Charley<br />I've heard so much about.
3765560 3767858 Yes, this is Django Freeman.
3768245 3770902 Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,<br />Leonide Moguy.
3771088 3772638 Just call me Leo.
3773062 3776113 Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.<br />You all wanna follow me?
3776704 3778998 How long have you been<br />associated with Mr. Candie?
3779612 3781168 Calvin's father<br />and I were about...
3781194 3783157 11 when we went<br />to boarding school together.
3783575 3786468 Calvin's father's father<br />put me through law school.
3786701 3789704 One could almost say<br />I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.
3789871 3791471 One could almost say youse a nigger.
3792631 3793601 What did you say?
3794286 3797039 I said...<br />Nothing, he's just being cheeky.
3797543 3801964 Anything else about Mr. Candie<br />that I should know before I meet him?
3801966 3804239 Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.
3804553 3806044 What civilized people aren't?
3806095 3808600 And he prefers Monsieur Candie<br />to Mr. Candie.
3808603 3810751 Si c'est cela qu'il prefere.<br /><font color="#00ffff"><i>Whatever he prefers.</i></font>
3810771 3812323 He doesn't speak French.
3812351 3814705 Don't speak French to him,<br />it'll embarrass him.
3818065 3820318 Get back on top, now!<br />Turn around!
3820485 3821779 There you go.
3822356 3823456 There you go.
3825734 3828123 Why do you want to get in<br />the Mandingo business?
3830745 3834252 You don't intend to allow your second<br />to make the proper introductions?
3835497 3836699 Quit stalling, now.
3837461 3838628 Answer the question.
3841297 3842370 The awful truth?
3843278 3844357 I'm bored.
3844991 3846679 This seems like a good bit of fun.
3852183 3854185 Well, come on over.
3854352 3857063 We got us a fight going on<br />that's a good bit of fun.
3861108 3862865 Won't you accompany me to the bar?
3871577 3873360 You don't wear a hat in the house,<br />white man.
3873362 3874344 Even I know that.
3883235 3885038 Dr. Schultz.<br />What a rare pleasure.
3885040 3886173 Keep fighting, niggers.
3886789 3888239 And I might add, an honor.
3888724 3889707 Honor to meet you.
3889709 3891760 Please have a seat,<br />the pleasure's all mine.
3891762 3894323 Get free man Django here<br />whatever he wants.
3895268 3897365 And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.
3917206 3918969 Use your weight boy, use your weight!
3918970 3920081 There you go.
3920683 3922529 He's much bigger and stronger!
3923151 3924182 Come on, now!
3924589 3927446 He's not doing what I told him,<br />for God's sakes.
3928200 3929488 Bravo Luigi, così e dai.<br /><font color="#00ffff"><i>Good Luigi, go on.</i></font>
3929778 3931034 Devi essere più rapido.<br /><font color="#00ffff"><i>Be more faster.</i></font>
3931178 3933897 Come on, now, boy!<br />It's a fight to the death!
3935443 3937494 You either hit him or are you ain't?
3941907 3943256 Ecco I con la spola tappeto.<br /><font color="#00ffff"><i>Make the carpet shuttle.</i></font>
3943346 3944724 La spola tappeto giù!<br /><font color="#00ffff"><i>The carpet down!</i></font>
3945506 3947303 Big Fred, come on!
3948487 3950171 Turn him around!<br />Now...
3953826 3955600 Use your strength, boy!
3956167 3958164 Come on, now! Use your strength!
3960249 3961303 There you go!
3963377 3964480 There you go!
3964840 3965931 Look at that.
3966995 3969104 See, I told you to put<br />some more power in there.
3969848 3971640 Do what I told you, boy!
3972347 3973433 There you go!
3973973 3976267 No!<br />Do what I told ya!
3976349 3979393 Blind him black, boy!<br />Blind him black!
3981729 3983401 Oh, no, Luigi.
4003793 4004953 Finish him.
4009686 4010943 Go on, boy, finish him!
4015887 4017597 That's why they call him Big Fred.
4017678 4019322 Worth every penny.
4019323 4021098 Well, arrivederci, Luigi.
4021390 4023658 Come on up, now, boy.<br />Get yourself a rest.
4023759 4026226 You did a fine job.<br />A real fine job.
4027108 4028107 Mercedes.
4049922 4050851 Tequila.
4061142 4062267 What's your name?
4064967 4065851 Django.
4068803 4069841 Can you spell it?
4072660 4074631 D-J-A-N
4075012 4075613 G
4076018 4076677 O
4078256 4079489 The D is silent.
4080252 4081002 I know.
4088449 4089481 Umberto, andiamo.<br /><font color="#00ffff"><i>Umberto, let's go.</i></font>
4089590 4090375 Mr. Moguy,
4090953 4092875 want you to take care<br />of my new boy here.
4093083 4095005 You find him a room with a soft bed,
4095007 4097258 then you bring him up a pony to lick his pole.
4097764 4100618 But you be ready to travel to Candyland<br />tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?
4100679 4101680 Yessir, Monsieur Candie.
4101862 4103218 Before you go Roscoe,
4103328 4105342 get Fred here a tall beer.
4109615 4110791 You enjoy that, boy.
4111482 4112401 You've earned it.
4112770 4113581 Yes sir.
4123370 4124560 What's your name, boy?
4124970 4127166 His name is Django Freeman.
4130939 4132181 Where'd you dig him up?
4132270 4135653 A fortuitous turn of events<br />brought Django and myself together.
4137616 4139101 I've heard tell about you.
4140374 4143468 I heard you been telling everybody<br />them Mandingos ain't no damn good.
4143470 4146418 Ain't nothing nobody is selling<br />is worth buying. I'm curious...
4147379 4149454 what makes you such<br />a Mandingo expert?
4151783 4153941 I'm curious what makes you so curious.
4157537 4159431 What did you say, boy?<br />Calm down, Butch.
4160743 4161966 No offense given...
4162701 4163734 none taken.
4164078 4165128 Monsieur Candie...
4166136 4169485 I'd appreciate if you could<br />direct your line of inquiry toward me.
4169625 4170442 One...
4171710 4174839 you do not have anything to drink.<br />Can I get you a tasty refreshment?
4175005 4175883 Yes!
4176154 4177842 I'll have a beer. Wunderbar.
4178107 4180302 Roscoe, a beer for the man<br />with the beard,
4180304 4182263 and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver.
4182265 4183586 Do not spare the rum.
4184140 4185011 Doc.
4186381 4187821 I am a seasoned slaver.
4188008 4188765 You are well,
4188893 4190023 you are a neophyte.
4190025 4192696 I'm simply trying to ascertain<br />if this cowboy here,
4192758 4194706 is taking advantage of you.
4196402 4197962 With all due respect,
4198536 4199410 Monsieur Candie...
4200337 4202214 I didn't seek you out for your advice.
4202436 4204823 I sought you out to purchase<br />a fighting nigger
4204825 4206749 at above top-dollar market price.
4207371 4210236 Now I was under the impression,<br />when you granted me an audience,
4210238 4212240 it would be to discuss business.
4215456 4217053 Well, we weren't talking business yet.
4217884 4219607 We were discussing my curiosity.
4222428 4223287 Thank you.
4223596 4224398 Roscoe,
4224515 4226034 Coco, go outside and play.
4228309 4229294 Sheba...
4229880 4231145 you stay right there.
4231937 4233480 I know you didn't mean me.
4235416 4236255 Prost!
4236827 4237635 German.
4238780 4240065 Now, according to Moguy,
4240690 4242448 if I do business with you,
4242771 4244658 I'm doing business with both you all.
4244825 4246638 He does the eyeballing,<br />you the billfold?
4246653 4247385 Is that it?
4247481 4250286 Well, you don't make<br />it sound too flattering,
4250288 4251518 but more or less, yeah.
4253792 4254606 So...
4255426 4256386 Bright Boy.
4257200 4259372 Moguy tells me you looked<br />over my African flesh
4259373 4261001 and you was none too impressed?
4261508 4262823 Not for top dollar.
4265343 4267222 Well, then, we got nothing more<br />to talk about.
4267505 4269632 You see, you wanna buy<br />a beat-ass nigger from me,
4269768 4272156 those are the beat-ass niggers<br />I wanna sell so...
4272203 4274238 He don't wanna buy the niggers<br />you wanna sell.
4275022 4276197 He wants the nigger,
4276557 4277867 you don't wanna sell.
4278480 4279863 I don't sell,
4279864 4282344 the niggers, I don't wanna sell.
4285058 4285924 Well,
4286419 4288333 you won't sell your best.
4288744 4290722 You won't even sell your second best.
4291330 4293188 But your third best?
4293189 4294736 You don't want to sell him either.
4295167 4298875 But if I made you an offer so ridiculous<br />you'd be forced to consider it...
4299950 4301994 who knows what could happen?
4304435 4306264 And what do you consider ridiculous?
4307554 4309824 For a truly talented specimen,
4310160 4311447 the right nigger?
4313565 4315049 How much would you say, Django?
4318816 4320159 $12,000.
4325072 4326169 Well, gentlemen,
4327086 4328603 you had my curiosity,
4329243 4330807 but now you have my attention.
4345048 4345834 Willie.
4347628 4349049 Hold up! Hold up.
4350681 4351878 Good morning, gentlemen.
4352198 4353521 Good Dr. Schultz.
4353724 4355099 Beautiful morning, isn't it?
4355774 4357187 You couldn't have picked a better one.
4357400 4360278 Please, won't you take a ride with us<br />here in the Victoria.
4360516 4362059 Oh, thank you very much.
4362187 4364063 You can tie your horse up back there.
4372453 4373453 Django.
4378678 4382206 Where I part company from many<br />of my phrenologist colleagues
4382458 4385036 is I believe there is a level above bright,
4386061 4387509 above talented,
4387935 4389742 above loyal that a nigger,
4389743 4391358 can aspire to.
4392107 4393966 Say, one nigger that just...
4393967 4396041 pops up in 10,000.
4396810 4398312 The exceptional nigger.
4399500 4401138 Bright day, Bright Boy?
4402626 4403540 Sun is up.
4404818 4406381 Shining on all of us.
4411642 4412535 Have a seat, doc.
4413693 4414369 Thank you.
4414768 4415729 Quite an honor.
4415996 4417655 The honor is all ours.
4417657 4419747 Thank you, but I do believe,
4419748 4421184 that given time,
4421563 4424217 exceptional niggers like Bright Boy here...
4425476 4427006 become if not frequent...
4428425 4429714 more frequent.
4431804 4433177 Bright Boy,
4434076 4436061 you are that one in 10,000.
4436558 4438035 The name of the game is keep up,
4438036 4439436 not catch up, nigger.
4455581 4458097 Touch your guns, you die.<br />Everybody, calm down!
4458990 4461159 Now I saw the whole thing.<br />No harm done.
4461161 4462265 Are you kidding me?
4462267 4464213 This nigger just...<br />I said no harm done!
4464456 4466111 Now take your hand off your pistol!
4467881 4468711 Butch,
4469539 4470676 that means you too.
4472080 4474670 Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.
4476454 4477079 Hoot!
4477756 4479131 Get back up on your horse.
4479520 4481145 He broke my collarbone!
4481147 4483018 For God's sake, somebody please
4483020 4485681 help Hoot here back up<br />on his goddamn horse.
4485906 4486828 Yes sir, boss.
4487031 4489006 Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.
4490155 4491776 You better listen to your boss,<br />white boy.
4491963 4494241 Oh, I'm gonna go walking in<br />the moonlight with you.
4494576 4495909 You wanna hold my hand?
4502499 4503316 Willie,
4504011 4505155 take us home.
4507421 4508982 Start moving!
4515804 4517055 Head them out!
4562863 4564464 You got a problem with your eyeball, boy?
4564925 4565757 No, sir.
4566038 4567540 You want a boot heel in it?
4568702 4569662 No, sir.
4569815 4572197 Then you keep your goddamn<br />eyeballs off me.
4573121 4576108 You flash that bad look at me again,<br />I'll give you a reason not to like me.
4576476 4577761 Now move, nigger!
4579826 4581954 You niggers are gonna<br />understand something about me.
4582120 4583997 I'm worse than any<br />of these white men here.
4584484 4587520 You get the molasses out your ass,<br />you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.
4588131 4589230 He is,
4589231 4591070 a rambunctious sort, ain't he?
4591644 4592543 Indeed.
4595092 4598510 May we stop for a moment<br />so I may put a word in my man's ear?
4598726 4602334 You know, I'm expecting to fall in love<br />once I see the specimens at Candyland,
4602391 4604281 so before that moment,
4604282 4605786 it would be good if I could have
4605788 4608810 a confidential strategy meeting with my...
4609206 4610023 confidant.
4613339 4614985 You mind telling me<br />what the hell you doing?
4614987 4617030 I confirmed that<br />Broomhilda's at Candyland.
4621172 4622142 You're sure it's her?
4622611 4623992 He didn't call her by name,
4623994 4625202 but she's a young lady,
4625203 4627184 whip marks on her back<br />and speaks German.
4627374 4629605 Now, while it's not wise to assume,
4629607 4631932 in this instance, I think it's pretty safe.
4632176 4633219 Point being,
4633816 4636498 don't get so carried away<br />with your retribution.
4637080 4638802 You lose sight of why we're here.
4639069 4640908 You think I lost sight of that?<br />Yes, I do.
4641093 4643047 Stop antagonizing Candie.
4643598 4645822 You're going to blow<br />this whole charade,
4645992 4648696 or more than likely<br />get us both killed.
4648870 4650907 And I for one, don't intend to die,
4650908 4653541 in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.
4653904 4655221 I'm not antagonizing him.
4655222 4656570 I'm intriguing him.
4656979 4659523 You're yelling abuse at these poor slaves.
4660353 4661631 I recall the man,
4662951 4665704 who had me kill another man<br />in front of his son
4666138 4667664 and he didn't bat a eye.
4669362 4670272 You remember that?
4672577 4673911 Yeah, of course I remember.
4673962 4675398 What you said was...
4675777 4677116 that this is my world...
4678515 4679987 and in my world you got to get dirty.
4681386 4682770 So that's what I'm doing.
4683098 4684116 I'm getting dirty.
4688144 4691314 Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...
4692564 4694297 that was the general gist.
4698295 4700064 See you at Candyland.
4707621 4708731 Alright, niggers,
4709270 4710207 back at it.
4711633 4713289 That means you too, Moonlight.
4760924 4762262 I'll be.
4762430 4763562 D'Artagnan!
4764572 4766964 Now, boy, why do a fool thing like run off?
4767637 4769665 I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.
4770053 4771099 Yes, you can.
4771537 4773844 You might not be able to win,<br />but your ass can fight.
4774869 4777403 Mr. Stonesipher, would you please<br />shut these goddamn dogs up?
4777614 4778868 I cannot hear myself think!
4778869 4780177 Quiet down, Marsha!
4780326 4782639 Marsha, hush up! Marsha!
4782826 4784256 Hush up! Hey!
4784314 4786815 Get these goddamn dogs<br />away from this nigger!
4796251 4797352 Come on now, boy...
4798711 4799790 get on out that tree.
4799880 4800909 Yes sir.
4824112 4825670 How long was he loose?
4826406 4827384 A night.
4828032 4828855 Day.
4829927 4831083 Half the other night.
4832579 4833881 How far he get off the property?
4834522 4835999 About 20 miles off the prop.
4836611 4838738 Pretty far considering that limp he got.
4841087 4841986 Mr. Moguy,
4841987 4844424 who was D'Artagnan<br />supposed to fight on Friday?
4844591 4845911 One of this new lot.
4847385 4848712 Well, way he looks now,
4848713 4850424 a blind Indian would<br />not bet a bead on him.
4850526 4853204 Please Monsieur Candie,<br />I ain't got it in me no more.
4853206 4854414 Now, now, now, now, now.<br />I can't...
4854416 4856242 Now, no... begging.
4857610 4859388 No playing on my soft heart.
4863343 4864612 You're in trouble, now son.
4864613 4865656 Yes sir.
4868232 4869232 You know.
4869564 4871854 I done paid $500 for you.
4872677 4874826 When I pay $500 then…
4875253 4877448 I expect to get five fights out of a nigger
4877473 4879092 before he roll over and play dead.
4879093 4879874 Sir.
4880147 4881455 You got to understand,
4881456 4883121 that I'm running a business here.
4884063 4885889 You fought three fights.
4885890 4887120 But I won every one.
4887122 4888055 Yes, you did.
4888056 4891471 Yes, you did but that last one, you muddled<br />the line between winning and losing.
4891638 4892507 Yes sir.
4895350 4896845 Still, the fact remains.
4897720 4900822 I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!
4901826 4903415 So what about my $500?
4906058 4907611 What about my $500?
4909358 4910702 You gonna reimburse me?
4917108 4919054 You even know what reimburse means?
4927674 4929034 I'll reimburse you!
4933317 4934111 You will?
4935775 4936511 Yep.
4940106 4941822 You'll pay $500,
4943046 4946280 for practically a one-eyed old Joe<br />ain't fit to push a broom?
4946429 4947371 No, he won't.
4949777 4951580 He just tired of you toying with him is all.
4953028 4954317 Matter of fact, so am I.
4955440 4957232 But we ain't paying a penny<br />for that pickaninny.
4957596 4959476 Ain't got no use for him.<br />Ain't that right, doc?
4961041 4961982 You heard him.
4971805 4975428 You're gonna have to excuse<br />Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.
4976498 4979168 He ain't never seen a nigger<br />like you ever in his life.
4980019 4981638 Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?
4984209 4985198 That right.
4986483 4987487 For that matter...
4989297 4990351 nor have I.
4996785 4997767 Now...
4999045 5002248 seeing as you won't pay a penny<br />for this pickaninny here...
5004892 5007920 you won't mind me handling<br />this nigger any way I see fit?
5009323 5010542 He's your nigger.
5014659 5016049 Mr. Stonesipher?
5017815 5020642 Let Marsha and her bitches<br />send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
5021518 5025882 Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!
5027774 5029984 Get him, get him!
5031146 5032190 Yeah!
5063923 5066044 Your boss looks<br />a little green around the gills
5066046 5067856 for a blood sport like nigger fighting.
5068231 5069051 Nah,
5069896 5072744 he just ain't used to seeing a<br />man ripped apart by dogs is all.
5075613 5076866 You are used to it?
5077405 5079879 I'm just a little more used<br />to Americans than he is.
5081645 5082353 Now,
5082919 5084479 Monsieur Candie...
5085165 5086280 whenever you're ready.
5087206 5089770 We rode five hours<br />so you could show off your stock.
5090456 5091753 Let's get to it.
5093869 5095705 Because as of now, if he's an example,
5096396 5097612 I ain't impressed.
5100209 5101244 Follow me.
5218631 5221210 Line them up to the left here now, boy.
5222969 5224476 Stand up straight, now!
5225513 5226806 Get up there.
5226874 5228079 Get up there, boy.
5228683 5229441 Come on.
5229726 5231483 Give me a line!<br />Give me a line!
5231596 5233614 Get in line there!<br />Straighten up!
5293568 5295201 Hello! Stephen, my boy!
5295206 5297548 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />Hello, my ass.
5298139 5300838 Who, this nigger up on that nag?
5301352 5302740 Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?
5303250 5304808 What's a matter?<br />Why you so ornery?
5304809 5306692 You miss me?<br />Oh, yes sir.
5307319 5308574 I miss you,
5308681 5310762 like a hog miss slop!
5310851 5314179 Like a baby miss mammy's titty.
5314903 5318938 I miss you like I misses a rock in my shoe.
5321384 5322884 Now I ask you,
5323333 5325993 who this nigger on that nag?
5325995 5326982 Hey, Snowball?
5328805 5330784 Wanna know my name<br />or the name of my horse,
5331233 5332203 you ask me.
5332622 5335446 Just who the hell you calling<br />Snowball, horse boy?
5335547 5336893 I'll snatch your black ass
5336894 5338654 off that nag there<br />and in the mud so fast...
5338656 5340638 make your head spin.<br />Stephen, Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.
5341004 5342317 Let's keep it funny.
5343204 5344658 Django here's a free man.
5345703 5347699 This nigger here?<br />That nigger there.
5348011 5350263 Let me at least introduce the two of you.
5350430 5351450 Django,
5351590 5354334 this is another cheeky black<br />bugger like yourself, Stephen.
5354541 5356087 Stephen, this here's Django.
5356387 5357645 You two oughta hate each other.
5357812 5358729 Calvin,
5358829 5362082 just who the hell is this nigger<br />you feels the need to entertain?
5362148 5366068 Django and his friend in gray here,<br />Dr. Schultz, are customers.
5366366 5367743 And they are our guests, Stephen.
5367778 5371538 And you, you old decrepit bastard,<br />oughta show them every hospitality.
5371540 5374026 You understand that?<br />Yes sir. Him I understand.
5374028 5375862 But I don't know why I got to<br />take lip off this nigger.
5375863 5378291 You don't have to know why.<br />Do you understand?
5379573 5381074 Yes sir. I understand.
5381077 5382387 Well, good.
5382865 5383776 They're spending the night.
5383778 5385593 Go up in the guest bedrooms<br />and get two ready.
5386953 5388621 He gonna stay in The Big House?
5388779 5390430 Stephen, he's a slaver.
5390596 5392570 It's different.<br />In The Big House?
5392695 5393977 Well, you got a problem with that?
5393992 5396449 Oh, no.<br />I ain't got no problem with it,
5396574 5398801 if you ain't got no problem<br />with burning the bed, the sheets,
5398919 5400796 the pillowcases, everything else
5400797 5402299 when this black-ass motherfucker's gone!<br />That is my problem!
5402300 5403374 They are mine to burn!
5403566 5405776 Now your problem right now<br />is making a good impression!
5406115 5408145 And I want you to start solving<br />that problem right now
5408193 5409819 and get them goddamn rooms ready!
5411933 5413148 Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
5415036 5416083 Go on, now.
5417121 5419540 Can't believe you brought<br />a nigger to stay in The Big House.
5419707 5421975 Your daddy rolling over<br />in his goddamned grave.
5421977 5424821 Man, the lip on him.<br />He's getting worse and worse.
5424921 5425835 Now,
5426379 5430772 where is my beautiful sister?
5431289 5432566 There she is!
5434701 5435849 Dr. Schultz,
5436230 5439393 this attractive Southern belle<br />is my widowed sister.
5439560 5440479 Darling,
5441122 5443564 you are a tonic for tired eyes.
5444816 5446299 May I present to you,
5446424 5448445 Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
5448593 5452052 Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.<br />Y'all get your ass over by that pen.
5452054 5454362 Come on, Charly. Come on, now!<br />Let's go.
5454364 5455407 You know where it is.
5455409 5456924 Like you on a rope!
5458371 5460877 Niggers don't walk around here,<br />niggers run!
5462036 5463637 Monsieur Candie?
5465002 5465929 Yeah.
5466178 5468678 About that matter about the<br />nigger girl you were talking about?
5469059 5470018 Nigger gal?
5470091 5473353 Yeah, I believe you mentioned<br />she spoke German.
5474255 5475834 Yes! Hilda, what about her?
5476360 5478816 Do you think before the demonstration,
5478817 5480450 you could send her around to my room?
5480889 5482949 You little dickens, you.
5483660 5484930 I don't see why not.
5484932 5485658 Stephen,
5485659 5488392 when you get through showing<br />them to their rooms, go fetch Hilda,
5488394 5490507 get her cleaned up<br />and smelling real nice,
5490531 5491654 and sent over<br />to Dr. Schultz's room here.
5491734 5493822 Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,
5493830 5496325 there is a something<br />I ain't told you about yet.
5496685 5497410 What?
5497865 5500068 Hilda in the Hot Box.
5502120 5503170 What's she doing there?
5503347 5505847 What you think she doing there<br />in the Hot Box?
5505912 5506998 She being punished.
5507587 5509744 What she do?<br />She run off again.
5510432 5513269 Jesus Christ Stephen, how many people<br />ran away while I was gone?
5513271 5513811 Two.
5514776 5515682 When did she go?
5515760 5518094 Last night.<br />They brung her back this morning.
5518936 5521269 How bad did Stonesipher's dogs<br />tear her up?
5522038 5525456 Lucky for her, they was out<br />chasing D'Artagnan's ass.
5525785 5527497 Bill and Cody went looking for her,
5527499 5529031 found her, brung her back.
5530217 5531526 Now, she a little beat-up.
5531527 5533227 But she done that<br />to her own damn self
5533229 5534475 running through them damn<br />bushes and shit.
5534570 5536026 How long she been in the box?
5536282 5539338 How long you think she been in there?<br />All damn day.
5539440 5542029 And the little bitch<br />got ten more days to be in there.
5542791 5544015 Still, take her out.
5544179 5545453 Take her out? Why?
5545455 5547394 Because I said so, that's why.
5547395 5549376 Dr. Schultz is my guest.
5549526 5550736 Hilda is my nigger.
5550738 5552458 Southern hospitality dictates,
5552459 5554032 I make her available to him.
5554034 5555889 But, Monsieur<br />Candie, she run off.
5555890 5557253 Jesus Christ, Stephen.
5557255 5559856 What is the point of having<br />a nigger that speaks German
5560013 5562352 if you can't wheel them out<br />when you have a German guest?
5562577 5566604 Now, I realize it is inconvenient,<br />but still, you take her ass out.
5566771 5567647 Yes sir.
5569232 5570303 Lara Lee!
5570304 5571963 Will you and Cora be responsible
5572022 5575551 for getting Hilda cleaned up<br />and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.
5575646 5577023 Of course, darling.
5577073 5579093 Now gentlemen, I do apologize,
5579094 5581953 but I am weary from<br />our travels beyond words.
5582345 5584722 It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.
5589957 5592588 Y'all done heard the man!<br />Get her ass up outta there!
5593144 5594027 Cora!
5594028 5595001 Come here!
5595466 5597215 Get over there and get her cleaned up,
5597217 5598700 bring her back over here to Dr...
5598934 5601042 What he say your name is? Shoots?<br />Schultz.
5601386 5602399 Schultz.
5602400 5604003 Get her back over here.<br />Hurry up, girl.
5604005 5604731 Yes sir.
5651061 5652057 Come on, girl.
5652724 5653524 Stand up.
5683694 5686935 Is you coming with me or is you gonna<br />sleep in that little box over yonder?
5782278 5783737 Hello, ladies.
5783904 5784969 Dr. Schultz.
5785485 5787344 May I introduce to you Broomhilda?
5791454 5793126 Hilda, this is Dr. Schultz.
5795522 5797501 It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.
5798906 5800880 I've heard a lot of good things about you.
5801046 5804008 Well, it's not every nigger<br />speaks German, don't ya know.
5807094 5809096 As I look at you now, Broomhilda,
5809907 5813979 I can see all the passions you inspire<br />are completely justified.
5817789 5819587 The doctor here speaks German.
5822049 5824009 And I've been informed<br />you do as well?
5825404 5827573 Go ahead, girl.<br />Speak a little German.
5836468 5837842 Astonishing.
5845054 5846639 And I shall bring you...<br />Much obliged.
5856602 5857431 <font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>
5878586 5880032 <font color="#ffff00"><i>Don't be afraid.</i></font>
5881180 5882355 Don't be afraid.
5922103 5922962 Pardon.
5930759 5931719 <font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>
6020534 6022222 <font color="#ffff00">I promise.</font>
6037772 6039089 Hey, Little Trouble Maker.
6048274 6050732 You silver-tongued devil, you.
6052548 6054297 Hurry up, girl.<br />These ready, Miss Cora.
6054388 6055835 No, no, no, they drinking tonight.
6055851 6058576 Go downstairs, get the big jug with<br />the red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?
6058758 6060349 Get your big pretty ass out the way.
6060380 6061746 You know you like it.
6062280 6064056 That's because you knows what I like.
6064127 6066794 Come on with these biscuits, girl.
6067011 6068121 Look, Monsieur Candie,
6068603 6071916 they were all fine specimens,<br />no doubt about it.
6072609 6075518 But the best three by far were...
6075956 6076898 Samson.
6078365 6079966 What's that other one's name?<br />Goldie.
6080117 6081043 Goldie.
6081546 6083097 And Eskimo Joe.
6083789 6085991 By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?
6086532 6089460 You never know how<br />these nigger nicknames get started.
6089626 6092212 His name was Joe, maybe one day<br />he said he was cold.
6092214 6093357 Who knows?
6096354 6097540 Well, regardless,
6097928 6099316 Samson's your best.
6099898 6101066 We all know that.
6101559 6102838 You will never sell him,
6102965 6103973 and I can see why.
6104231 6105703 He's a champion.
6107012 6108707 All three are champions.
6109688 6110943 Samson's the champion.
6112143 6113501 Them other two pretty good.
6115197 6116628 Calvin, now what's this nigger you let...
6116695 6118033 It's alright. It's alright.
6118097 6119758 You have to understand, Monsieur Candie,
6120240 6123753 while admittedly a neophyte,<br />in the nigger fight game,
6123786 6128247 I do have a little bit of a background<br />in the European traveling circus.
6128248 6129333 Is that right?
6129644 6130663 Hence,
6130888 6133587 I have big ideas when<br />it comes to presentation.
6135046 6137150 I need something more<br />than just a big nigger.
6139258 6141478 Yeah, he needs to have panache.
6141602 6143626 Need to have what? What?<br />Panache.
6145050 6147728 A sense of Showmanship.<br />Showmanship, yes.
6147730 6149409 I want to be able to bill him
6149612 6151397 as The Black Hercules.
6152949 6154595 The Black Hercules, isn't that clever?
6154673 6155674 More like Nigger-les.
6158030 6159906 I said and I told,
6160620 6162279 I would pay top dollar,
6162529 6163251 for...
6163989 6165863 the right nigger.
6166794 6170063 Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe<br />is the wrong nigger, per se.
6171218 6173616 But is he right as rain?
6175087 6176289 Oh, Dr. Schultz,
6176970 6178201 I will have you know,
6178339 6179555 there is no one,
6179556 6180622 in the nigger fight game
6180694 6182880 that appreciates the value<br />of showmanship
6182882 6184946 more than Monsieur Calvin<br />J. Candie here.
6184948 6185804 Nobody.
6185917 6189184 But one must not forget the most<br />important thing in the nigger fight game.
6189351 6191923 And that is a nigger that can win fights.
6192896 6197109 Now that should be your first, second,<br />third, fourth, and fifth concern.
6197276 6199356 Now, after you have that,<br />and you know you have that,
6199486 6200956 then you can start,
6200957 6202694 to implement a grand design.
6203513 6204514 In other words,
6204617 6206281 first thing is first.
6206326 6207786 First thing's first.
6216896 6218747 I see you two getting on.
6219742 6220791 Famously.
6221633 6223080 Oh, Monsieur Candie,
6223081 6224654 you can't imagine what it's like
6224656 6226846 not to hear your native tongue,
6226847 6228051 in four years.
6228083 6230353 Well, hell, I can't imagine<br />two weeks in Boston.
6232516 6233926 Two weeks in Boston!
6234383 6236146 Monsieur Candie, you a mess!
6237302 6238997 Two weeks in Boston!
6239276 6242525 I can't express the joy I felt
6242526 6244489 conversing in my mother tongue.
6244656 6248988 And Hilda is a charming<br />conversation companion.
6249051 6251198 Well, be careful now, Dr. Schultz.
6251518 6253707 You might-a caught yourself<br />a little dose of nigger love.
6254329 6256340 Nigger love's a powerful emotion, boy.
6256825 6258578 It's like a pool of black tar.
6258624 6260251 Once it catches your ass, you're caught.
6260388 6261947 Yes sir, you stuck.
6263292 6264573 I don't know, doctor.
6265090 6267342 You can lay on all the<br />German sweet talk you want,
6267408 6268267 but...
6268268 6271740 it looks like this pony's<br />got big eyes for Django.
6274552 6275312 Well,
6275699 6276987 naturally.
6277062 6278736 It is the soaring,
6278737 6280690 eagle that attracts her attention,
6280692 6282312 not the plucked chicken.
6283654 6286661 Dr. Schultz,<br />don't be so down on yourself.
6286663 6288575 You are quite the dapper<br />European gentleman.
6288590 6289608 You got to clean these dishes,
6289618 6291900 you got to put your elbow<br />in these dishes, you hear me?
6291981 6294006 You know that nigger, don't you?
6295204 6296325 Who?<br />Who?
6296500 6299031 Don't who me, bitch.<br />You know who I'm talking about.
6301463 6302594 At the table?
6303486 6304633 I don't know him.
6305052 6306430 You don't know him.
6306838 6307649 No.
6308011 6309038 No, what?
6309749 6310665 No, sir.
6315780 6317611 You would not lie to me now, would you?
6322384 6323263 Ok.
6324829 6327729 Yeah. If you say so.
6334204 6335921 Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
6336492 6337518 no doubt about it.
6339275 6340375 But if it was my money,
6342113 6344250 I would not pay no $12,000 for him.
6344504 6346259 What would your price be?
6346842 6348802 Well, if I was inclined to be generous,
6348969 6350371 and I don't know why,
6350497 6352276 I would be inclined to be generous...
6353390 6354641 9,000.
6356135 6356807 Maybe.
6357894 6358851 Dr. Schultz,
6359960 6361921 let me reclarify how this whole
6361922 6363692 negotiation came about.
6364204 6366437 You see, it wasn't me<br />who came to you to sell a nigger.
6366507 6367286 Sure wasn't.
6367289 6369309 It was you who approached me to buy one.
6369339 6370257 Sure was.
6370429 6374358 Now, that $9,000 figure Bright Boy's been<br />bandying about, that ain't too far off from right.
6374365 6376283 And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that,
6376285 6378623 I could do so any day of the week.<br />Any day.
6379162 6381116 But, like you said in Greenville, doctor...
6381740 6383100 I don't want to sell him.
6383920 6384993 It was only your...
6385601 6388409 ridiculous offer of $12,000
6388411 6390330 that made me even consider it.
6399426 6403190 You know, Monsieur Candie,<br />you do possess the power of persuasion.
6407420 6409980 Why not?<br />Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.
6409982 6412259 Eskimo Joe, $12,000.
6412466 6413420 Hooray, doctor.
6413451 6415492 Hooray.<br />And a wise decision that is.
6415743 6418956 However, that is a tremendous<br />amount of money.
6419391 6422454 And the way you have<br />your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.
6422542 6424336 Persnickety man named Tuttle.
6424727 6427919 And I would need my Mr. Tuttle<br />to draw up a legal contract
6428052 6431464 before I'd feel comfortable exchanging<br />that amount of money for flesh.
6432135 6434124 Not to mention having<br />Eskimo Joe examined,
6434126 6436516 by a physician of my choosing.<br />Naturally.
6437110 6441002 So, say I return in about...
6443848 6445941 five days time.<br />Five days?
6446108 6447475 With my Mr. Tuttle.
6447695 6449951 And then my Mr. Tuttle<br />and your Mr. Moguy,
6449953 6452199 can hash out the finer<br />details between themselves.
6453732 6455365 I say splendid, doctor.
6455639 6456698 Splendid.
6457327 6458305 Gentlemen...
6459707 6461267 may I propose a toast.
6463974 6465627 To Eskimo Joe.
6465628 6467571 Or shall we call him.
6467945 6469216 The Black Hercules?
6470144 6471591 To The Black Hercules.
6471758 6473135 The Black Hercules.
6473301 6474719 To The Black Hercules.
6474886 6476319 You was right, doctor.
6476320 6477777 That name do have pan-ass.
6480775 6481489 Hilda,
6482406 6483543 top my drink off.
6486815 6487780 So Hilda,
6488498 6490925 how you like serving<br />at the big table in The Big House?
6492135 6494562 When Monsieur Candie talk to you,<br />you answers.
6495526 6497403 I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
6498536 6502476 It's a lot better than sizzling in that Hot Box<br />or dragging your ass through a bramble bush.
6502908 6506220 But maybe it's not quite as much fun as<br />getting to pleasure all them Mandingos,
6506222 6507173 Sugar bear?<br />Oh, Lord.
6507174 6507940 She like them niggers.
6507958 6508936 Sure do.<br />Like Samson?
6508945 6509984 No, sir.
6510714 6512048 You know, Monsieur Candie,
6512360 6516162 the doctor here might be interested<br />in seeing Hilda's peeled back,
6516208 6519183 seeing as how they don't have<br />many niggers where he come from.
6519472 6520603 Dr. Schultz,
6520738 6522365 when you was alone with Hilda, here,
6522366 6524114 did you just speak German or...
6524115 6525411 did you get to take her clothes off?
6525478 6526830 No, we just talked and...
6527053 6529078 Oh, so you haven't seen her back?
6529587 6531684 I haven't...<br />No, no, no, no.
6531692 6533599 Stephen's right,<br />you might find this interesting.
6533841 6536908 Hilda, go on, take off your dress.<br />Show Dr. Schultz your back here.
6537056 6538347 Go on.<br />Calvin.
6539177 6541369 I just got her all dressed up<br />and looking nice.
6541536 6544637 But, Lara Lee, Dr. Schultz<br />is from Dusseldorf.
6544806 6546208 They don't got niggers there.
6546209 6547876 He is a man of medicine.
6547946 6550735 I'm sure it would fascinate him,<br />the niggers' endurance for pain.
6550844 6554291 These niggers are tough,<br />Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.
6554377 6556850 Hilda's got something<br />like four lashes on her back.
6556852 6559199 Lara Lee just get one,<br />she'd lose her goddamn mind.
6559201 6560331 Sure would.<br />Look at that, doctor.
6560333 6562042 It's like a painting. Look at that.<br />Calvin!
6563073 6565946 We are eating. Ain't no one wanna<br />look at her whipped up back.
6568407 6570190 Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.
6570743 6572078 After dinner, then, Stephen.
6572227 6573104 After dinner.
6574463 6575744 During the brandies, gentlemen?
6582410 6583954 Cora, come get this girl!
6587415 6588446 She a mess.
6588879 6589802 Yes, ma'am.
6590794 6592350 Why are you all undone?
6592351 6593345 I just got you done up.
6593347 6594552 Come on in here.
6601263 6603442 Baby, you on Stephen bad side,
6603443 6605280 and you need to be on his blind side.
6605396 6607231 You say you ain't know him.
6609562 6610618 I said,
6611526 6614682 you said you ain't know him.
6616319 6617300 I don't.
6618453 6619510 Yes, you do.
6622186 6623306 Mr. Stephen...
6624721 6625495 I don't.
6626060 6627833 Why is you lying to me?
6630542 6631530 I ain't.
6632562 6633794 Then why is you crying?
6635202 6636615 You scaring me.
6637048 6638439 Why is I'm scaring you?
6639542 6640760 Because you scary.
6642637 6645724 To speak German<br />this afternoon with Hilda
6645890 6648453 was positively soul-enriching.
6649185 6651238 Doctor, that warms my heart to hear that.
6652450 6654602 You stay right here.
6660405 6662418 You indicated earlier,
6662928 6665127 you'd be willing to part with Hilda.
6665404 6667757 Why, yes. Yessiree bob, I did.
6670079 6671342 In that case,
6671944 6673369 allow me...
6673973 6675785 to propose another proposition.
6676320 6677220 I'm all ears.
6677455 6679165 Hurry up, goddamn it!
6680110 6681490 Monsieur Candie...<br />Stephen!
6682716 6684633 You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.
6686139 6688379 I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.
6688736 6691144 My ears ain't worth a damn these days.
6691311 6692437 Excuse him.
6692604 6695425 Monsieur Candie, could I get<br />a word with you in the kitchen?
6696734 6698443 You mean get up out of my chair?
6698819 6700691 If'n you could manage it.
6700974 6701703 Why?
6702344 6704055 It's about dessert.
6704056 6705367 What about dessert?
6706184 6708599 I'd rather discuss that in private.
6708912 6710711 We're having white cake!
6711234 6713446 What sort of melodrama<br />could be brewing back there?
6713893 6717595 You right, Monsieur Candie.<br />You right. I'll handle it myself.
6717962 6719756 Meet me in the library.
6719923 6723278 I just can't understand why you<br />won't come talk to these niggers.
6723286 6725166 Shit get fucked up around here,<br />you blame me.
6725385 6727311 Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen, I...
6728311 6729988 I will be along momentarily.
6730392 6731296 Yes sir.
6732586 6733403 Well,
6734439 6735427 gentlemen,
6735835 6738402 as you can see talented as<br />they are, no doubt, in the kitchen,
6738436 6739506 from time to time,
6740163 6742177 adult supervision is required.
6744864 6746431 If you'll excuse me a moment.
6752831 6754624 You may clear the dinner service.
6756165 6757666 You heard him. Go on! Get.
6759040 6759993 Hurry up, girl.
6760031 6761047 So, Dr. Schultz,
6762031 6764574 why don't you regale us<br />with a tale of the circus.
6765564 6767008 The circus?
6774469 6775772 What is the matter?
6781628 6786129 Them motherfuckers<br />ain't here to buy no Mandingos.
6786886 6788205 They wants that girl.
6790530 6791358 Stephen,
6791529 6792841 what the hell are you talking about?
6793412 6795200 They playing your ass for a fool
6795201 6796582 is what I'm talking about.
6796970 6798137 They ain't here,
6798813 6800295 for no musclebound Jimmie.
6801123 6802415 They here for that girl.
6802797 6804354 Wh... What girl?
6804356 6805425 Wha... Hilda?
6805592 6806685 Yeah, Hilda.
6806849 6807784 Her and Django,
6808142 6809404 them niggers know each other.
6811157 6813075 He just bought Eskimo Joe.
6813077 6814231 Did he give you any money?
6814232 6815302 No! Not yet. But...
6815304 6816823 Then he ain't bought diddly.
6816824 6817765 Not yet, no how.
6818134 6820106 But he's just about to buy...
6820492 6823094 who he come here to buy<br />when I interrupted him.
6823987 6825045 Thank you, Stephen.
6825436 6826668 You're welcome, Calvin.
6832076 6834078 Where you getting all this?
6835438 6838772 Why would they go through all that<br />trouble for a nigger with a chewed up back,
6838773 6840199 ain't worth $300?
6840355 6843757 They doing it because that nigger<br />Django's in love with Hilda.
6844450 6845747 She probably his wife.
6846454 6850389 Now, why that German gives a fuck<br />who that uppity son of a bitch is in love with,
6850390 6852177 I'm sure I don't know.
6854933 6856603 If she's who they want...
6857477 6858843 why this whole...
6859128 6861773 snake oil pitch about<br />Mandingos, then?
6862065 6865094 You would not pay<br />no never mind to no $300.
6865893 6867573 But that 12,000?
6868709 6870648 That made you real friendly,<br />now, didn't it?
6873785 6875173 Yes, it did.
6878954 6880018 His wife?
6884703 6886205 If it had been a snake,
6886987 6888231 it would have bit me.
6891653 6893325 Those lying...
6894364 6896411 goddamn time...
6896682 6899916 wasting sons of bitches.
6902355 6903523 Sons of bitches!
6904148 6905126 Out of New Orleans,
6905127 6908723 so I have quite a bit of practice<br />with theater types.
6910309 6911449 Oh, there you are.
6912049 6914843 I was beginning to think that you<br />and that old crow run off together.
6916529 6918479 That'd be a hell of a note, would not it?
6919357 6920115 Lara Lee,
6920491 6922146 I was just looking out the big window.
6922165 6924152 Billy Crash is out there<br />dealing with some...
6924348 6925341 shady slaver
6925343 6926772 trying to sell a passel of ponies.
6926774 6929672 Would you be a dear, go out there<br />and give them gals an eyeball?
6930672 6931942 Of course, brother.
6931943 6932924 Thank you, darling.
6945875 6947023 Yeah.
6947173 6948877 Business never sleeps.
6951779 6952734 Apropos,
6953380 6954878 before your exit,
6955097 6959189 we were discussing the possibility<br />of my purchasing Broomhilda.
6959202 6960085 Ah yes.
6960511 6961766 Yes, we were, doctor.
6962224 6964351 And we will again. In a moment.
6980725 6982418 Who's your little friend?
6987732 6988987 This is Ben.
6990734 6992262 He's a old Joe that...
6992743 6994894 lived around here for a long time.
6995841 6997634 And I do mean a long damn time.
6999526 7000659 Old Ben here,
7001358 7002910 took care of my daddy...
7003873 7005504 and my daddy's daddy.
7006286 7008455 Till he up and keeled over one day.
7011506 7013174 Old Ben took care of me.
7015760 7017366 Growing up the son of a...
7017601 7020006 a huge plantation owner in Mississippi
7020050 7023517 puts a white man in contact<br />with a whole lotta...
7024358 7025580 black faces.
7027495 7029106 I spent my whole life here,
7029606 7030562 right here,
7031226 7032321 in Candyland,
7033945 7035052 surrounded,
7035826 7037505 by black faces.
7039786 7042574 Now, seeing them every day,<br />day in, day out,
7043424 7045129 I only had one question.
7049274 7050369 Why don't they kill us?
7054581 7056707 Now, right out there on that porch,
7057343 7059491 three times a week for 50 years,
7059999 7061182 Old Ben here,
7061710 7064120 would shave my daddy<br />with a straight razor.
7065260 7065930 Now,
7066230 7067293 if I was Old Ben,
7067625 7070216 I woulda cut my daddy's goddamn throat
7070439 7073590 and it would not have taken me<br />no 50 years to do it, neither.
7076411 7077517 But he never did.
7079735 7080683 Why not?
7082201 7083041 You see,
7083946 7085996 the science of phrenology
7087165 7089041 is crucial to understanding
7089634 7092253 the separation of our two species.
7094088 7096478 In the skull of the African here,
7098092 7100496 the area associated<br />with submissiveness,
7100636 7102563 is larger than any human or
7102564 7105767 any other subhuman<br />species on planet Earth.
7121769 7123054 If you examine...
7124619 7126788 this piece of skull here...
7133085 7134198 you will notice,
7134566 7137039 three distinct dimples.
7140259 7141194 Here,
7141934 7142641 here,
7143078 7143858 and here.
7144305 7145007 Now...
7145653 7147588 if I was holding the skull of an
7147983 7150298 Isaac Newton or Galileo,
7150880 7154796 these three dimples would be found in<br />the area of the skull most associated with...
7155511 7156543 creativity.
7157549 7158940 But this is the skull of Old Ben.
7160126 7161676 And in the skull of Old Ben,
7162156 7164035 unburdened by genius,
7164617 7168650 these three dimples exist in the area<br />of the skull most associated with...
7169914 7170974 servility.
7172588 7173595 Now, Bright Boy.
7174919 7176845 I will admit you are pretty clever.
7179799 7181623 But if I took this hammer here...
7184018 7185955 and I bashed in your skull with it...
7187402 7189689 you would have the same three dimples,
7190478 7192227 in the same place,
7193688 7194921 as Old Ben.
7196416 7197611 Hey!
7197752 7199889 Now lay your palms flat on that tabletop!
7200274 7203231 If you lift those palms<br />off that turtle shell tabletop,
7203389 7205955 Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose<br />with both barrels of that sawed-off.
7207878 7210951 There have been a lot of lies said<br />around this dinner table here tonight,
7211097 7212624 but that you can believe!
7213826 7214595 Mr. Moguy,
7215004 7216619 would you be so kind<br />as to collect the pistol
7216621 7218119 hanging off these boys' hips here?
7223591 7224897 Thank you ever so much.
7225077 7225894 Doctor.
7230604 7231496 Where were we?
7236365 7237539 Jackass.
7241686 7242675 Ah yes.
7243556 7244592 I do believe,
7244757 7246154 you were just getting ready to make me,
7246173 7248104 a proposition to buy Broomhilda.
7248870 7249815 Am I right?
7254165 7255056 Right.
7258075 7259018 Bring out Hilda!
7262344 7263588 Get over there yonder.
7265176 7267428 Sit your ass in that goddamn...
7267595 7268995 Lay your hand flat on that tabletop.
7269013 7270390 Now shut your mouth!
7274852 7275870 Dr. Schultz,
7276444 7277438 in Greenville,
7277605 7279036 you yourself said,
7279442 7280584 that for the right nigger,
7280586 7284509 you'd be willing to pay what some<br />may consider is a ridiculous amount.
7285312 7286540 To which me myself said,
7286845 7288578 What is your definition of ridiculous?
7288580 7289621 To which you said,
7290261 7292203 $12,000.
7293210 7294334 Now considering,
7294501 7296874 you all have ridden a whole lot of miles,
7297204 7298618 went through a whole lot of trouble,
7299090 7301380 and done spread a whole lot of bull
7301435 7303754 to purchase this lovely lady right here,
7303756 7305769 it would appear that Broomhilda,
7305871 7306931 is in fact,
7307350 7309089 the right nigger.
7310279 7312826 And if you all want to leave<br />Candyland with Broomhilda,
7314075 7315349 the price...
7315931 7319273 is $12,000.
7319801 7323602 And I take it you prefer the take it<br />or leave it style of negotiation?
7325653 7326927 Yes, I do doctor.
7328170 7330589 You see, under the laws<br />of Chickasaw County,
7331200 7332522 Broomhilda here,
7332795 7334185 is my property.
7334912 7336866 And I can choose to do,
7336999 7338233 with my property,
7338348 7339982 whatever I so desire!
7341252 7343328 And if you all think my price...
7344388 7345958 for this nigger here,
7345960 7347088 is too steep...
7348104 7350347 what I'm gonna desire to do is...
7354572 7356242 take this goddamn hammer here,
7356243 7357789 and beat her ass to death with it!
7357791 7360242 Right in front of both you all!<br />Easy, big fella.
7360244 7362448 Then we can examine the three dimples
7362661 7364442 inside Broomhilda's skull!
7364875 7365816 Now,
7366273 7367716 what's it gonna be, doc?
7369190 7370687 What's it gonna be?
7370689 7374064 May I lift the hands off the tabletop<br />in order to remove my billfold?
7375536 7376727 Yes, you may.
7390579 7391954 That 12.
7395624 7397051 Sold!
7398214 7400744 To the man with the exceptional beard
7401050 7403904 and his unexceptional nigger.
7409975 7411822 Mr. Moguy.<br />Yes, Calvin?
7412978 7416104 Will you make these gentlemen a receipt<br />for $12,000, please?
7416313 7417788 $12,000.
7421272 7423394 It was a pleasure doing business<br />with you all.
7424043 7425156 Now gentlemen,
7427004 7428881 if you care to join me in the parlor...
7429840 7431987 we will be serving white cake.
7520639 7521902 Well done, Calvin.
7524490 7525341 Excuse me.
7526169 7527357 Excuse me, ma'am?
7528814 7530668 Could you please stop<br />playing Beethoven?
7531254 7532912 Take your hands off the harp!
7536739 7537919 Doctor!
7538580 7540889 Doctor, you can't go in there!<br />Stephen.
7540932 7542210 Stephen.<br />He ain't got no business going in there.
7542226 7543054 Let it be.
7543788 7545539 He's just a little upset, that's all.
7546080 7547158 I'll handle this.
7573188 7574118 White cake?
7575356 7577387 I don't go in for sweets, thank you.
7587623 7589905 You brooding about me<br />getting the best of you?
7591153 7595566 Actually, I was thinking of that<br />poor devil you fed to the dogs today.
7595994 7597111 D'Artagnan.
7598693 7601451 And I was wondering what<br />Dumas would make of all this.
7602655 7603537 Come again?
7607297 7608706 Alexandre Dumas.
7608707 7610772 He wrote The Three Musketeers.
7611556 7612856 Yes, of course, doctor.
7613188 7615075 I figured you must be an admirer.
7615115 7616343 You named your slave,
7616344 7618581 after his novel's lead character.
7619738 7623322 Now if, Alexandre Dumas<br />had been there today,
7623324 7625075 I wonder what he would have made of it.
7627563 7628950 You doubt he'd approve?
7631250 7632209 Yes.
7632210 7636144 His approval would be<br />a dubious proposition at best.
7638903 7640291 Soft-hearted Frenchie.
7642581 7644364 Alexandre Dumas is black.
7648684 7650501 Are these Broomhilda's papers?
7650667 7651528 Yes, they are.
7651559 7652375 May I?
7652493 7653344 Of course.
7653472 7654237 Thank you.
7657096 7660104 That is her bill of sale,<br />her ownership history,
7660106 7662031 and of course,<br />her freedom papers, doctor.
7662462 7664598 Would you have ink and pen for me?
7665869 7668230 Right over there on that little table.<br />Thank you.
7689892 7691004 Thank you.
7694977 7696713 Broomhilda Von Shaft...
7699460 7701315 consider yourself a free woman.
7713766 7715336 Mr. Candie...
7717461 7718567 normally,
7719387 7721118 I would say auf Wiedersehen.
7721699 7725886 But since what auf Wiedersehen actually<br />means is till I see you again
7726536 7728716 and since I never wish<br />to see you again,
7728717 7729795 to you sir,
7730483 7732859 I say, goodbye.
7737106 7738019 Let's go.
7739412 7740501 Come on.
7743095 7744720 One more moment, doctor!
7746870 7747716 What?
7752504 7754456 It's a custom here in the South,
7755310 7758499 once a business deal is<br />concluded that the two parties,
7759124 7760118 shake hands.
7761482 7762884 It implies good faith.
7763644 7765873 I'm not from the South.<br />But you are...
7766780 7768205 in my house, doctor.
7769928 7771491 So I'm afraid I must insist.
7771762 7772574 Insist?
7773027 7773806 On what?
7774278 7775234 That I shake your hand?
7775236 7778531 Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist<br />in the opposite direction.
7779134 7780582 You know what I think you are?
7780903 7782262 What you think I am?
7782264 7783588 No, I don't.
7785571 7787498 I think you are a bad loser.
7788049 7790784 And I think you're an abysmal winner.
7791240 7792453 Nevertheless,
7793117 7795914 here in Chickasaw<br />County a deal, ain't done...
7796510 7798784 until the two parties have shook hands.
7799593 7802429 Even after all that paper signing,<br />don't mean shit...
7803496 7804465 you...
7805008 7806498 don't shake my hand.
7807936 7810794 If I don't shake your hand,
7811266 7813328 you're gonna throw away $12,000?
7813932 7815195 I don't think so.
7816926 7817904 Mr. Pooch?
7819837 7823637 If she tries to leave here before this<br />nigger-loving German shakes my hand,
7824615 7825843 you cut her ass down.
7848403 7851181 You really want me<br />to shake your hand?
7853251 7854567 I insist.
7856133 7857911 If you insist.
7875336 7878038 No! Calvin!
7879122 7881166 Calvin!
7887047 7887972 I'm sorry.
7888355 7889604 I couldn't resist.
7901812 7903824 Nigger's gone crazy! Help!
7904147 7905980 Help, he's killing everyone!
7923093 7923975 Holy!
7924738 7926598 Shit! Son of a bitch!
7930674 7931883 Damn it! Fucking!

7938254 7939321 What? Fucking...
7939725 7941176 Goddamn it!
7942613 7945082 What the fuck is going on?
7946037 7947333 You shot me!
7947437 7950184 You stupid son of a bitch!<br />Sorry, Jessie!
7950764 7954656 Who the fuck gave a nigger<br />a goddamn gun?
7984858 7985595 Aim low!
7988479 7989983 Nigger! Gonna kill!
7990979 7992299 Oh God!
7992455 7993276 Oh, my God!
7994551 7995837 Motherfucker!
8004482 8005177 Shit!
8062456 8062992 Shit.
8075485 8076903 Hold your fire!
8080323 8081825 Hold your fire!
8083744 8085503 Stop shooting, goddamn it!
8094515 8095561 Django!
8096438 8097269 What?
8100533 8101843 We got your woman!
8103593 8106491 Billy Crash here<br />got his pistol upside her head.
8107117 8109003 You don't stop all that carrying on,
8109305 8111390 he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.
8112063 8113779 And that ain't no threat, horse boy.
8114736 8115937 That there is a promise.
8117652 8118527 Or...
8119231 8120305 you can give up,
8120766 8122017 throw your gun out...
8123266 8124445 we won't kill Hilda.
8124619 8125608 Horseshit!
8125860 8128955 Honest lnjun, Django.<br />I swear before God.
8130290 8131431 You give up,
8132377 8134703 ain't no harm gonna come to her.
8136537 8138475 And I'm supposed to believe<br />your black ass?
8138965 8142031 Personally, I don't give a good goddamn<br />what you believe or don't believe!
8142110 8145258 I believe if you don't give up<br />in the next ten seconds,
8145289 8147116 we gonna blow this bitch's brains out!
8147374 8148791 Believe that!
8151186 8152439 Don't do it.
8153406 8154620 You give me up.
8155006 8156855 Six!<br />Just let me go.
8157186 8158730 Seven!<br />They got too much.
8158961 8160308 Django.<br />Eight!
8160767 8161788 I love you.
8162300 8163158 Nine!
8163420 8164290 Hold it!
8164658 8165429 No.
8167466 8168321 I give up.
8169690 8171885 I can't hear you, nigger.
8172689 8174543 I said, I give up!
8198430 8199287 No!
8202272 8202967 No!
8295108 8297165 Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.
8302586 8304150 So you all bounty hunters?
8305548 8308047 I knew there was something<br />fishy about you all.
8309513 8311251 We found your wanted posters...
8312097 8314031 and book of figures<br />in your saddlebags.
8316006 8317227 I got to say...
8318416 8320929 I ain't never heard of<br />no black bounty hunter before.
8321655 8324699 Black boy paid to kill white men?<br />How'd you like that line of work?
8325782 8327963 Probably pretty good while it lasted?
8338191 8339975 Time to say good night<br />to them nuts, blackie.
8340554 8341437 On three.
8341733 8342542 One.
8343996 8344874 I got you.
8345367 8346022 Two.
8347114 8349042 Calm down, now, here it comes.
8349894 8350918 Captain?
8351884 8353359 Miss Lara want to see you.
8354736 8357501 Something to do<br />with the Old Man's funeral.
8358747 8362057 Oh, and she changed her mind<br />about snipping Django.
8363334 8365930 She gonna give him<br />to the LeQuint Dickey people.
8367917 8369922 Well, she didn't waste<br />a minute telling me.
8377123 8378594 How disappointing.
8401937 8402859 You leaving.
8405140 8406201 This here,
8406741 8407898 what you take with you.
8411463 8415229 Your black ass has been all them<br />motherfuckers at The Big House
8415231 8417645 could talk about for the last few hours.
8418676 8422498 Seem like white folk ain't never<br />had a bright idea in they life
8422522 8425001 was coming up with all<br />kinds of ways to kill your ass.
8425290 8430070 Now mind you, most of them ideas had<br />to do with fucking with your fun parts.
8430888 8431597 Now,
8431661 8432923 that may seem,
8433119 8434527 like a good idea,
8434785 8436004 but truth is,
8437876 8440403 when you snip a nigger's nuts,
8440427 8442484 most of them bleed out in, oh, about...
8443696 8444560 seven minutes.
8444562 8445518 Most of them.
8446356 8447070 Well,
8448331 8449526 more than most.
8450400 8451652 Then I says.
8453444 8455052 Shitfire.
8456421 8458720 The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey
8458721 8460286 got it worse than that.
8461463 8462822 And they still saying.
8462823 8464263 Let's whip him to death.
8464482 8467502 Or Throw him to the Mandingos.<br />Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs.
8467827 8468782 And I said.
8469001 8470880 What's so special about that?
8471306 8473174 We do that shit all the time.
8473404 8474535 Hell's bells.
8474536 8477310 The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey,
8477732 8479361 got it worse than that.
8480604 8482848 Lo and behold,
8483389 8484716 out of nowhere,
8484717 8487369 Miss Lara come up with the bright idea,
8488387 8491531 of giving your ass to<br />the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
8494419 8495628 And as a slave,
8496418 8498495 of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,
8499571 8500623 henceforth,
8501104 8502512 till the day you die,
8503297 8505821 all day, every day,
8506547 8508603 you will be swinging a sledgehammer,
8509535 8511126 turning big rocks,
8511833 8513264 into little rocks.
8514606 8515740 Now, when you get there,
8516314 8518237 they gonna take away your name,
8519094 8520245 give you a number,
8520246 8521597 and a sledgehammer,
8522214 8523942 and say, get to work!
8524910 8527285 One word of sass,<br />they cuts out your tongue.
8527480 8529366 And they good at it too.<br />You won't bleed out.
8529854 8532545 They does that real good.
8533619 8534775 They gonna work ya.
8535429 8537625 All day, every day,
8538331 8539600 till your back give out.
8540623 8543036 Then they're gonna hit you<br />in the head with a hammer,
8543203 8544987 throw your ass down the nigger hole.
8546109 8547169 And that...
8547789 8550937 will be the story of you, Django.
8590208 8592402 And what's the golden rule, Frankie?
8592835 8594705 You don't root abos.
8599717 8601009 Hey, white boy.
8602720 8604299 I said, hey, white boy.
8605719 8606747 Shut up, black.
8606748 8608142 You ain't got nothing<br />to say I want to hear.
8608184 8610240 How'd you like to make $11,000?
8610770 8611776 Do what, now?
8612253 8615095 I said how'd you like to make $11,000?
8615938 8618067 $11,500, actually.
8618477 8620029 What the fuck are you talking about?
8620511 8622249 Back there at that plantation, Candyland,
8622846 8625315 there was an $11,500 fortune,
8625440 8626399 just sitting there.
8626572 8627959 And you all rode right past it.
8628830 8630668 You be damned blackie,<br />we're not bandits.
8630731 8631748 I ain't saying that.
8631832 8633311 Nice thing about this fortune,
8633819 8634874 is it ain't illegal.
8635307 8636370 You can't steal it.
8637076 8638366 You got to earn it, white boy.
8639463 8641301 You got something to say, mate,<br />you say it.
8641679 8643532 The $11,500 fortune
8643533 8644900 waiting for you back at Candyland
8645011 8647303 is in the form of a<br />Wanted Dead or Alive bounty
8647476 8649696 on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.
8649829 8651496 Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?
8651498 8654714 Smitty Bacall is the leader of this<br />murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,
8655081 8656316 the Bacall Gang.
8656685 8659736 There's a seven thousand dollars<br />Wanted Dead or Alive bounty on him,
8660066 8662886 One thousand five hundred dollars<br />for each of his three accomplices.
8663618 8664678 Dandy Michaels,
8665345 8666526 Gerald Nash,
8666969 8668930 and Crazy Craig Koons.
8669704 8671122 Now all four of them gentlemen,
8671289 8672589 they back there at Candyland,
8672817 8674518 laughing their ass off.<br />You know why?
8675190 8676836 Because they just<br />got away with murder.
8677586 8678963 But it ain't got to be that way.
8679130 8680150 You and your mates,
8680478 8682425 you all can ride back there and<br />you all can go get that money.
8682717 8683877 What'd these jokers do again?
8684088 8686737 These sons of bitches,<br />they killed innocent people.
8687513 8688811 Stagecoach robbery.
8689053 8690273 Innocent white people.
8691851 8694854 I got the handbill right here<br />in my pocket, if you let me get it.
8695021 8696056 Get it out.
8698241 8700038 Wanted. Dead or alive.
8700431 8703406 Smitty Bacall<br />and the Smitty Bacall Gang.
8703515 8704783 But you're a slave.<br />For murder...
8704864 8707583 I ain't no goddamn slave.<br />And stagecoach robbery.
8707738 8709108 Do I sound like a fucking slave?
8709118 8710749 $7,000 for Smitty Bacall.
8710994 8712902 That's a shitload.<br />I'm a bounty hunter.
8714957 8715951 Yesterday,
8716276 8717367 as a free man,
8717924 8720421 I rode into Candyland on a horse,
8720422 8722256 with my German white partner,
8722423 8723853 Dr. King Schultz.
8724133 8727385 We tracked the Bacall<br />Gang all the way from Texas,
8727386 8728888 to Chickasaw County.
8729223 8731974 We finally found their ass<br />laying low in Candyland.
8732141 8733547 We went in there to get them,
8734043 8735243 things went sour,
8735812 8737057 my partner got killed,
8737575 8738992 Calvin Candie got shot,
8739393 8741521 then everybody there<br />decided to blame me,
8742045 8743105 so here I am.
8745644 8747362 But you all know<br />I ain't on that manifest.
8747772 8750099 And all you all know<br />I ain't supposed to be on this trip.
8750688 8752425 But them four men is still back there,
8752654 8753689 they're still wanted,
8754038 8757399 and that 11,500 is up for grabs,<br />and the last thing they'd expect
8757538 8759470 is you all riding back in there<br />and getting it.
8759919 8761195 What's the deal?
8762007 8764158 You tell us who they are and we...
8765069 8766489 turn you loose?<br />No, no, no, no.
8766490 8768000 I ain't gonna tell you who they are.
8768727 8770173 But, you give me a pistol,
8770856 8772014 one of them horses,
8772181 8774961 and $500 of that 11,500,
8775507 8776686 and I'll point them out to you.
8777024 8778509 This is a real handbill.
8778740 8780182 Now just because it's a real handbill
8780184 8782191 doesn't mean that other<br />bunch of malarkey is.
8782482 8783684 Now why,
8783685 8787019 would a slave have a<br />Wanted Dead or Alive handbill
8787266 8788545 in his pocket?
8793107 8795901 Did that black ride<br />into Candyland yesterday?
8802248 8803324 Alright,
8804082 8805775 I'm gonna ask you again.
8807519 8809886 I want you to remember, I don't like liars.
8810719 8812554 Is he a Candyland slave,
8812597 8816094 or did he ride in with a white man<br />on a horse yesterday?
8816640 8817333 Yeah.
8818676 8820833 They walked us from<br />the Greenville auction,
8820888 8822754 and he rode in on a horse<br />with a white man.
8823608 8825255 Now this white man,
8826109 8827715 was the black his slave?
8828173 8829447 He weren't no slave.
8830064 8831912 You fucking sure about that?
8831913 8833047 Damn sure.
8837413 8839543 What happened over in Candyland?
8839544 8840763 Bunch a shooting.
8841125 8842322 Massa got shot.
8843085 8844159 Who shot him?
8844160 8845058 The German.
8845410 8846453 Why'd he do that?
8847211 8849859 Nigger and the German was acting<br />like they were slavers but they wasn't.
8850920 8852139 Well, what were they?
8852746 8854006 Bounty hunters.
8855177 8857871 Fuck me, Roy.<br />I mean, this could be big, mate.

8900017 8901517 What them saddlebags got in them?
8902273 8903331 Dynamite.
8903497 8905805 No. I ain't riding no horse<br />with no goddamn dynamite on its back.
8906438 8907831 I can understand that.
8908317 8909098 Frankie,
8909753 8911543 why don't you take<br />them sticks off that horse
8911545 8913380 and stick them in the nigger cage.
8914930 8916966 A little dynamite for you<br />black fellas to play with.
8928628 8931399 Now, Floyd, you got that<br />rifle up on the wagon, don't you?
8931505 8932506 Yeah, right.
8932653 8934645 Why don't you give him<br />your gun and gun belt?
8935469 8936270 Right.
8936948 8939594 Now, don't drop the fucking thing,<br />alright?
8940067 8941852 I've just had the sights fixed,
8941969 8943009 and they're perfect.
8943060 8944186 Oh, that's good to know.
