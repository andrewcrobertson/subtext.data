78161 80622 Um, like everybody else back then.

115866 118368 [PANTING]<br />Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.
118702 121204 - I thought you were the ghost.<br />- No.
122873 124875 There are no such things as ghosts, babe.
125042 127210 Grandpa says you can get ghosts.
128629 133383 Maybe that's because Grandpa's close<br />to being one himself. Back to bed.
133717 135552 Were you dreaming about the crash?
136970 139264 Get your butt back in bed, Murph. Heh.
166291 167793 WOMAN 1:<br /><i>The wheat had died.</i>
168627 170962 <i>The blight came and we had to burn it.</i>
171880 174591 <i>And we still had corn. We had acres of corn.</i>
174758 177010 But, uh, mostly we had dust.
179429 182057 WOMAN 2:<br /><i>I guess I can't describe it. It was just constant.</i>
182224 184685 Just that steady blow...
184851 186103 <i>...of dirt.</i>
188188 191274 WOMAN 3:<br /><i>We wore, um, little strips of sheet...</i>

216925 218427 - Check?<br />- Yes, sir.
219970 221638 Not at the table, Murph.
222389 224224 Dad, can you fix this?
225809 227144 COOPER:<br />What the heck did you do...
227310 228478 - ...to my lander?<br />- Wasn't me.
228645 230522 Let me guess. It was your ghost?
230689 233024 It knocked it off.<br />It keeps knocking books off.
233191 234693 TOM:<br />No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.
234860 236987 - Hey.<br />- I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.
237154 238405 Dad, tell her.
238572 240490 Well, it's not very scientific, Murph.
240657 242993 You said science was about admitting<br />what we don't know.
243160 245328 - She's got you there.<br />- Hey.
245495 246997 Start looking after our stuff.
248623 249833 Coop.
252627 254796 All right, Murph, you want to talk science?
255756 259009 Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.<br />No, you got to go further.
259176 262345 You got to record the facts, analyze,<br />get to the how and the why...

358066 361278 Why did you and Mom name me<br />after something that's bad?
361444 362821 We didn't.
363196 364698 Murphy's Law?
365657 369744 Murphy's Law doesn't mean<br />that something bad will happen.
369911 373290 What it means is<br />whatever can happen will happen.
373456 376001 And that sounded just fine with us.

532365 534284 So for ten years?
537245 539873 - Why did it come down so low?<br />- I don't know.
540040 542959 Maybe the sun cooked its brain<br />or it was looking for something.
543126 545378 - What?<br />- Give me a large flatblade.
545795 548465 Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know.
553720 555221 What are you gonna do with it?
556139 559309 I'm gonna give it something<br />socially responsible to do...
560185 561519 ...like drive a combine.
562103 563605 Can't we just let it go?
565899 567567 It wasn't hurting anybody.
569235 571738 This thing needs to learn<br />how to adapt, Murph...
572030 573531 ...like the rest of us.

590673 593843 - Just please try not to.<br />- Hey. Relax.
595261 596596 I got this.
600850 602143 Little late, Coop.
602310 603853 Yeah, we had a flat.
604020 607565 And I guess you had to stop off<br />at the Asian fighter plane store.
607857 611444 No, actually, sir, that's a surveillance drone.
611611 614364 With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian.
614781 616116 Take a seat.
617242 618743 So, uh...
619452 622038 ...we got Tom's scores back.
622580 624541 He's going to make an excellent farmer.
624707 628211 Yeah, he's got a knack for it.<br />What about college?
628378 632132 The university only takes a handful.<br />They don't have the resources to...
632298 634592 I still pay my taxes.
634759 636761 Where's that money go?<br />There's no more armies.
637262 639597 Well, it doesn't go to the university.
640181 641808 Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.
641975 644769 You're ruling my son out for college now?
645311 648815 - The kid's 15.<br />- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
649816 651985 What's your waistline? About what, 32?
652402 656072 - About a 33 inseam?<br />- I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.
656239 660660 It takes two numbers to measure your ass<br />but only one to measure my son's future?
661536 664414 Come on. You're a well-educated man, Coop.
664581 666541 - And a trained pilot.<br />- And an engineer.
667041 671796 Okay, well, right now<br />we don't need more engineers.
672255 676593 We didn't run out of television screens<br />and planes. We ran out of food.
676926 680346 The world needs farmers.<br />Good farmers, like you.
680513 682891 - And Tom.<br />- Uneducated farmers.
683808 687729 We're a caretaker generation, Coop.<br />And things are getting better.
687896 691024 - Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...<br />- Are we done here, sir?
692317 693401 No.
694235 696404 Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.
696738 699282 HANLEY:<br />Murph is a great kid. She's really bright.
699449 701701 But she's been having a little trouble lately.
701868 705246 She brought this in to show the students.<br />The section on the lunar landings.
705413 707916 Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.
708374 710376 She always loved the pictures.
710543 714255 It's an old federal textbook. We've<br />replaced them with the corrected versions.
714422 715465 Corrected?
715632 719761 Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked<br />to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
726476 728436 You don't believe we went to the moon?
729562 731564 It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.
731731 734567 The Soviets bankrupted themselves<br />pouring resources...
734734 736986 ...into rockets and other useless machines.
737153 738238 "Useless machines."
738404 742492 If we don't want a repeat of the excess<br />and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...
742659 746454 ...we need to teach our kids about this planet,<br />not tales of leaving it.
747288 751292 One of those useless machines<br />they used to make was called an MRI.
751668 755004 If we had any of those left,<br />the doctors would've been able to find...
755171 758925 ...the cyst in my wife's brain<br />before she died instead of afterwards.
759092 762178 Then she'd have been the one<br />listening to this instead of me...
762345 765431 ...which would have been a good thing,<br />because she was always...
766015 767517 ...the calmer one.
768184 770270 I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.
771521 775191 But Murph got into a fistfight<br />with several of her classmates over this...
775358 777026 ...Apollo nonsense.
777193 779654 So we thought it best<br />to bring you in and see what ideas...
779821 782490 ...you might have for dealing<br />with her behavior on the home front.
783700 786744 Yeah, you know what?<br />Um, there's a game tomorrow night.
786911 789038 She's going through a bit of a baseball phase.
789205 793418 Her favorite team is playing.<br />There's gonna be candy and soda and...
796504 798339 I think I'll take her to that.
801551 803094 [WHISTLING]

892225 893893 MURPH:<br />Nothing special about which book.
894560 896813 I've been working on it, like you said.
897563 900066 - I counted the spaces.<br />- Why?
902110 904195 In case the ghost is trying to communicate.
904987 906531 I'm trying Morse.
907115 908366 Morse?
908699 909784 Yeah.
910201 912829 - Dots and dashes, used...<br />- I know what Morse code is, Murph.
912995 915915 I just don't think<br />your bookshelf's trying to talk to you.
927510 931889 Had to reset every compass clock and GPS<br />to offset for the anomaly.
932181 934725 - Which is?<br />- I don't know.
936519 938646 If the house was built on magnetic ore...
938813 941899 ...we'd have seen this the first time<br />we switched on the tractor.
944569 947738 I hear your meeting at the school<br />didn't go so well.
948364 950074 Heh. You heard?
951033 953870 It's like we've forgotten who we are, Donald.
955538 959041 Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.
960751 962378 When I was a kid...
962545 966674 ...it felt like they made something new<br />every day. Some...
967049 970344 ...gadget or idea.<br />Like every day was Christmas.
970803 973473 But six billion people...
973890 975892 ...just try to imagine that.
976893 979896 And every last one of them<br />trying to have it all.
981939 983107 [SIGHS]
983274 985193 This world isn't so bad.
987445 989655 And Tom will do just fine.
989822 994202 You're the one who doesn't belong.<br />Born 40 years too late, or 40 years too early.
995203 997705 My daughter knew it, God bless her.
998581 1001375 And your kids know it. Especially Murph.
1001709 1005129 Well, we used to look up in the sky<br />and wonder...
1005296 1007673 ...at our place in the stars.
1010092 1014472 Now we just look down and worry<br />about our place in the dirt.
1014972 1017808 Cooper, you were good at something...
1018142 1020645 ...and you never got a chance<br />to do anything with it.
1021437 1022772 I'm sorry.
1024482 1025900 WOMAN 4:<br /><i>You didn't expect...</i>
1026067 1028611 ...this dirt that was giving you this food...
1028945 1032031 ...to turn on you like that and destroy you.
1032532 1036661 In April... I believe I'm right...<br />Fifteenth of April, I think.
1037119 1039413 This happened about 1:30 when that thing...
1039747 1041499 ...came off the top of that canyon.

1043209 1045336 In my day, we had real ballplayers.

1050299 1052343 ...fighting over food to even play baseball.
1052635 1057515 Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.<br />I want a hot dog.

1060560 1062061 I think that's great.
1062353 1065648 - You think that's great?<br />- You hate farming, Dad.
1066440 1068067 Grandpa said.
1068234 1069652 COOPER:<br />Grandpa said, huh?
1070069 1072613 Listen, all that matters<br />is how you feel about it.
1072780 1074448 I like what you do.
1075157 1076659 I like our farm.

1196028 1197655 Grab your pillow.
1198447 1200282 You're sleeping in with Tom.

1268017 1272188 You want to clean that up<br />when you've finished praying to it?
1297546 1299799 It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.

1363946 1366282 You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.
1368117 1370119 Make yourself useful.
1433474 1434808 [SOFTLY]<br />Hey, Murph?
1436435 1437478 Murph!
1440981 1443317 I think this is the end of the road.
1446320 1448364 Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?
1449531 1450783 That's my girl.
1478519 1479770 MAN'S VOICE:<br />Step away!
1479937 1483023 COOPER: Don't shoot! I'm not armed.<br />My daughter's in the car.
1483190 1484650 [CRACKLING]
1486819 1488404 [FOOTSTEPS]
1488570 1490823 MAN'S VOICE: Don't be afraid.<br />- Aah!
1503544 1505629 MAN'S VOICE:<br />How did you find this place?
1506338 1507673 Where's my daughter?
1507965 1511885 You had the coordinates for this facility<br />marked on your map. Where did you get them?
1512052 1513387 Where's my daughter?
1513554 1516473 Don't make me take you down again.<br />Sit down!
1516807 1519018 COOPER:<br />Oh, you still think you're a Marine, pal?
1519184 1521770 Marines don't exist anymore.
1522062 1527026 - And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.<br />- Where did you find those coordinates?
1527192 1529778 But you don't look much like a lawnmower.
1529945 1532781 Think I'll turn you<br />into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.
1532948 1534158 WOMAN:<br />No, you won't.
1535784 1537703 TARS, back down, please.
1539204 1542332 You know, you're taking a risk<br />using ex-military security.
1542791 1546628 They're old, and their control units<br />are unpredictable.
1546795 1548797 It's what the government could spare.
1548964 1550299 [PANTING]
1550466 1551633 Who are you?
1552092 1553427 Dr. Brand.
1553594 1555971 I knew a Dr. Brand once. He was a professor.
1556346 1557848 What makes you think I'm not?
1558307 1560642 Wasn't near as cute, either.
1560976 1563479 Please, Dr. Brand.<br />I don't have any idea what this is.
1564313 1566815 Now I'm scared for my daughter<br />and want her by my side.
1566982 1569443 You give me that,<br />I'll tell you anything you want to know.
1572821 1575824 Get the principals and the girl<br />in the conference room, please.
1577159 1578535 Your daughter is fine.
1578994 1580037 Bright kid.
1580621 1582456 Must have a very smart mother.
1582623 1585042 It's pretty clear you don't want any visitors.
1585209 1589171 So why don't you just let us back up from<br />your fence and we'll be on our way? Huh?
1589463 1592007 - It's not that simple.<br />- Well, sure, it is.
1592341 1596011 I don't know anything about you.<br />I don't know anything about this place.
1596887 1598055 Yes, you do.
1603769 1604853 Dad!
1607523 1608565 Hello, Cooper.
1610025 1611068 Professor Brand.
1613237 1615197 MAN:<br />Explain to me how you found this facility.
1615364 1618659 Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled<br />upon it. We were on a salvage run...
1618826 1621537 You're sitting in the best-kept secret<br />in the world.
1621703 1625207 Nobody stumbles in here.<br />Nobody stumbles out.
1625541 1627209 BRAND:<br />Cooper, please.
1627668 1629753 Cooperate with these people.
1629920 1631130 Look.
1632047 1633715 It's kind of hard to explain.
1634049 1638220 We learned these coordinates<br />from an anomaly.
1638971 1640305 What sort of anomaly?
1640472 1643767 I hesitate to term it supernatural,<br />but it definitely wasn't scientific.
1643934 1647855 You're going to have to be specific,<br />Mr. Cooper. Right now.
1648021 1649273 It was gravity.
1652943 1657156 Um, what sort of gravitational anomaly?<br />Where was this?
1657322 1660617 Now, I'm real happy that you're excited<br />about gravity, bud...
1660784 1663996 ...but you're not getting any answers from us<br />until I get assurances.
1664163 1665455 - Assurances?<br />COOPER: Yeah.
1666290 1669751 Like, that we're getting out of here.<br />And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.
1669918 1671587 [ALL LAUGH]
1672296 1674423 Don't you know who we are, Coop?
1674590 1675841 No, professor, I don't.
1676008 1678010 WOMAN:<br />You know my father, Professor Brand.
1678635 1679928 We're NASA.
1681722 1683932 - NASA?<br />BRAND: NASA.
1684266 1686059 The same NASA you flew for.
1697112 1698780 COOPER:<br />I heard they shut you down, sir...
1698947 1701241 ...for refusing to drop bombs<br />from the stratosphere...
1701408 1702951 ...onto starving people.
1703118 1705454 When they realized<br />that killing other people was...
1705621 1708457 ...not a long-term solution,<br />then they needed us back.
1708624 1710626 - In secret.<br />- Why secret?
1710792 1714630 BRAND: Because public opinion wouldn't<br />allow spending on space exploration.
1715088 1717382 Not while you're struggling<br />to put food on the table.
1718800 1719968 Blight.
1720427 1724264 Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.
1725015 1726683 Now there's just corn.
1727017 1728977 And we're growing more than we ever have.
1729144 1733315 But like the potatoes in Ireland<br />and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...
1733899 1736401 ...the corn will die.
1737152 1738195 Soon.
1742199 1743325 [COOPER SIGHS]
1743492 1747079 We'll find a way, professor. We always have.
1747829 1751833 Driven by the unshakable faith<br />the Earth is ours.
1752334 1754211 Not just ours, no.
1755003 1756338 But it is our home.
1757673 1761009 Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.
1761176 1762886 We don't even breathe nitrogen.
1763053 1768392 Blight does. And as it thrives,<br />our air gets less and less oxygen.
1768558 1772020 The last people to starve<br />will be the first to suffocate.
1772187 1774356 And your daughter's generation...
1776024 1778277 ...will be the last to survive on Earth.
1778443 1782030 WOMAN: Murph is tired. I was wondering<br />if she could take a nap in my office.
1782531 1784032 Yeah. Thank you.
1786827 1787869 Okay...
1788870 1792374 ...now you need to tell me<br />what your plan is to save the world.
1793041 1796545 We're not meant to save the world.<br />We're meant to leave it.
1802384 1803427 COOPER:<br />Rangers.
1803719 1808682 The last components of our one versatile ship<br />in orbit, the <i>Endurance.</i>
1808974 1810600 Our final expedition.
1811393 1814354 You sent people out there<br />looking for a new home?
1814980 1816273 The Lazarus missions.
1816606 1819568 - Oh, that sounds cheerful.<br />- Lazarus came back from the dead.
1819901 1821903 Sure, but he had to die in the first place.
1822529 1825240 There's not a planet in our solar system<br />that could sustain life...
1825407 1827909 ...and the nearest star's<br />over a thousand years away.
1828076 1830746 That doesn't even qualify as futile.
1832414 1833749 Where'd you send them?
1834166 1835584 Cooper...
1835751 1838545 ...I can't tell you anymore unless you agree...
1838712 1840547 ...to pilot this craft.
1840714 1844009 - You're the best pilot we ever had.<br />- I barely left the stratosphere.
1844301 1846428 This team never left the simulator.
1846762 1850557 We need a pilot, and this is the mission<br />that you were trained for.
1850724 1852225 Without even knowing it?
1853268 1857522 An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive.<br />You were going anyway.
1857689 1859399 We had no choice.
1859566 1861318 But something sent you here.
1861651 1864363 - They chose you.<br />- Who's "they"?
1872329 1874247 How long would I be gone?
1874831 1877751 Hard to know. Years?
1878460 1880087 I've got kids, professor.
1880587 1882631 Get out there and save them.
1886009 1887386 Who's "they"?
1887552 1891348 We started detecting gravitational anomalies<br />almost 50 years ago.
1891681 1895310 Mostly small distortions to our instruments<br />in the upper atmosphere.
1895477 1898605 In fact, I believe<br />you encountered one yourself.
1899272 1901274 Yeah, over the Straights.
1902275 1905320 My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire.
1905487 1906696 Exactly.
1907531 1912452 But of all these anomalies,<br />the most significant is this:
1912619 1914621 Out near Saturn...
1914788 1916873 ...a disturbance of space-time.
1919000 1922129 - Is that a wormhole?<br />- It appeared 48 years ago.
1922587 1924506 And it leads where?
1925048 1926675 Another galaxy.
1928427 1930679 A wormhole's not<br />a naturally occurring phenomenon.
1930846 1932264 Someone placed it there.
1933056 1934558 - "They"?<br />- Mm.
1935058 1939146 And whoever they are,<br />they appear to be looking out for us.
1939604 1942190 That wormhole lets us travel to other stars.
1942357 1944276 It came along right as we needed it.
1944443 1947362 They've put potentially habitable worlds<br />right within our reach.
1947529 1949448 Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.
1949614 1951992 - You sent probes into that?<br />- Mm-hm.
1952159 1955162 We sent people into it. Ten years ago.
1956496 1958165 The Lazarus missions.
1958498 1959708 BRAND:<br />Twelve possible worlds...
1959875 1962210 ...twelve Ranger launches carrying...
1962669 1965088 ...the bravest humans ever to live...
1965255 1967883 ...led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.
1968383 1971386 Each person's landing pod<br />had enough life support for two years.
1971553 1973513 But they could use hibernation<br />to stretch that...
1973680 1976892 ...making observations on organics<br />over a decade or more.
1977058 1980896 Their mission was to assess their world,<br />and if it showed potential...
1981229 1985650 ...then they could send out a signal,<br />bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.
1985817 1987861 And what if the world didn't show promise?
1988487 1989905 Hence the bravery.
1990697 1993241 You don't have the resources<br />to visit all 12.
1993408 1994534 No.
1995410 1998205 Data transmission back through<br />the wormhole is rudimentary.
1998371 2003418 Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us<br />some clue as to which worlds have potential.
2003585 2005378 And one system shows promise.
2005712 2008256 One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?
2009090 2011927 One system with three potential worlds?
2012344 2013929 No long shot.
2016097 2017224 Okay.
2017933 2020268 So if we find a home...
2022938 2026399 - ...then what?<br />- That's the long shot.
2026733 2029945 There's a Plan A and a Plan B.
2030445 2033406 Did you notice anything strange<br />about the launch chamber?
2045126 2048046 COOPER:<br />This entire facility's a centrifuge.
2048380 2050882 Some kind of vehicle. A space station?
2051216 2052968 BRAND:<br />Both. Plan A.
2053134 2055220 How do you get it off the ground?
2055387 2059057 The first gravitational anomalies<br />changed everything.
2059391 2063728 Suddenly we knew<br />that harnessing gravity was real.
2064062 2068733 So I started working on a theory<br />and we started building this station.
2069109 2071194 But you haven't solved it yet.
2072279 2073822 That's why there's Plan B.
2074322 2079035 The problem is gravity. How to get<br />a viable amount of human life off the planet.
2079202 2080495 This is one way.
2080829 2083331 Plan B: a population bomb.
2083665 2088420 Over 5,000 fertilized eggs<br />weighing in at just under 900 kilos.
2089129 2090630 How would you raise them?
2090797 2093258 With equipment on board,<br />we incubate the first 10.
2093425 2097304 After that, with surrogacy,<br />the growth becomes exponential.
2098013 2101308 Within 30 years,<br />we could have a colony of hundreds.
2101474 2104853 The real difficulty with colonization<br />is genetic diversity.
2105478 2107022 This takes care of that.
2107188 2109649 But what about the people here? You just...
2110025 2111359 ...give up on them?
2111985 2113236 My kids?
2113778 2117115 That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.
2119367 2122245 - How far have you got?<br />- Almost there.
2122412 2124831 You're asking me to hang everything...
2125874 2127208 ...on an almost.
2127751 2130045 I'm asking you to trust me.
2131755 2132964 [SIGHS]
2133131 2134799 Find us a new home.
2135550 2137552 And by the time you return...
2138136 2140805 ...I will have solved the problem of gravity.
2141765 2143350 I give you my word.
2155987 2157489 MURPH:<br />Go away!
2168166 2169209 Murph.
2169584 2172587 MURPH:<br />Go! If you're leaving, just go.
2175382 2178218 DONALD: This world was never enough<br />for you, was it, Coop?
2179052 2182806 What, because heading out there<br />is what I feel like I was born to do?
2183765 2185600 And it excites me? Heh.
2186309 2188770 No, that does not make it wrong.
2188937 2190063 It might.
2190438 2193566 Don't trust the right thing<br />done for the wrong reason.
2194317 2196653 The why of the thing, that's the foundation.
2196820 2198905 And the foundation's solid.
2202075 2207080 We farmers, we sit here every year<br />when the rains fail and we say:
2207372 2208623 "Next year."
2209290 2212961 Well, next year ain't gonna save us,<br />nor the one after that.
2213795 2217924 This world's a treasure, Donald,<br />but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.
2222637 2226433 Mankind was born on Earth,<br />it was never meant to die here.
2229561 2232772 Tom will be all right,<br />but you got to make things right with Murph.
2232939 2233982 I will.
2234941 2238111 Without making promises<br />you don't know you can keep.
2248747 2250749 You have to talk to me, Murph.
2253251 2255378 I need to fix this before I go.
2255545 2258423 MURPH:<br />Then I'll keep it broken so you have to stay.
2260008 2265013 After you kids came along, your mom said<br />something to me I never quite understood.
2265388 2267015 She said, "Now...
2268892 2273396 ...we're just here<br />to be memories for our kids."
2278526 2281029 And I think that now I understand<br />what she meant.
2284783 2288536 Once you're a parent,<br />you're the ghost of your children's future.
2290163 2292332 You said ghosts didn't exist.
2298797 2300298 That's right, Murph.
2303510 2304844 Murph, look at me.
2307889 2310391 I can't be your ghost right now.
2312185 2314187 I need to exist.
2315814 2317732 They chose me.
2318441 2322403 Murph, they chose me. You saw.<br />You're the one who led me to them.
2325031 2327534 That's exactly why you can't go.
2330745 2332705 I figured out the message.
2333122 2336334 - One word. Know what it is?<br />- Murph.
2336501 2337836 "Stay."
2338211 2341089 - It says, "Stay," Dad.<br />- Murph.
2342048 2343508 You don't believe me.
2343675 2346469 Look at the books! Look at this.<br />It says, "Stay."
2346636 2349597 Why...? You're not listening! It says, "Stay!"
2349931 2351766 No, I'm coming back.
2351933 2353268 When?
2366281 2368741 One for you, one for me.
2369117 2372287 When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...
2372620 2375164 ...traveling near the speed of light, or...
2376165 2378293 ...near a black hole...
2378751 2383298 ...time's gonna change for me.<br />It's gonna run more slowly.
2384883 2386676 When we get back...
2387802 2389220 ...we're gonna compare.
2389387 2392015 MURPH: Time will run differently for us?<br />- Yeah.
2393099 2397770 By the time I get back,<br />we might even be the same age, you and me.
2398146 2400481 "What?" Imagine that!
2405028 2406195 Aw, Murph...
2406362 2408990 You have no idea when you're coming back.
2410783 2412285 No idea at all!
2415413 2417540 Murph, don't... Don't make me leave like this.
2417707 2419208 Come on, Murph!
2419709 2422045 Don't make me leave like this, Murph!
2429636 2430678 Hey...
2431220 2432555 ...I love you.
2432931 2434849 Forever. You hear me?
2435308 2438519 I love you forever, and I'm coming back.
2444317 2445652 I'm coming back.
2463878 2466047 - How'd it go?<br />- Fine.
2466798 2468257 Just fine.
2474722 2475848 I love you, Tom.
2476391 2478518 - Travel safe, huh?<br />- Yeah.

2580328 2581746 What a great idea!
2581913 2584624 TARS: I have a cue light I can use<br />when I'm joking if you like.
2584791 2585833 That'd probably help.
2586000 2589921 You can use it to find your way back<br />to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.

2657363 2660408 - We should learn to talk.<br />- And when not to.
2662702 2664245 Just being honest.
2664412 2666747 I don't think you need to be that honest.
2667165 2669584 Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?
2669750 2672378 TARS: Ninety percent.<br />- Ninety percent?
2672545 2675590 Absolute honesty isn't always<br />the most diplomatic, nor the...
2675756 2678342 ...safest form of communication<br />with emotional beings.

2931846 2933931 Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.
2934348 2939019 We have some Dramamine in the hab pod,<br />or maybe in the cryo-beds. I'll just be a sec.

3050297 3053551 No, it's not like looking for a new condo.

3062643 3064478 We need to find that rock.
3064812 3067523 And our three prospects<br />are at the edge of what...
3067690 3069567 ...might sustain human life.

3079827 3082997 AMELIA: Uh, Wolf Edmunds is here.<br />- Tell me about Edmunds.
3083831 3086584 Oh, uh, Wolf's a particle physicist.
3088877 3091213 None of them had families, huh?
3092256 3095134 No. No attachments. My father insisted.
3095301 3098846 They all knew the odds against<br />ever seeing another human being again.
3099013 3100973 I'm hoping we can surprise<br />at least three of them.
3101140 3103058 - How about Mann?<br />- Dr. Mann?
3103225 3105144 He's remarkable. He's the best of us.
3105311 3109690 He inspired 11 people to follow him<br />on the loneliest journey in human history.

3168332 3170417 Just let me ask you something.
3172670 3176131 - Dr. Brand and Edmunds...<br />- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.
3177591 3180594 Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?
3180761 3182179 I wouldn't know.
3182346 3185349 Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"<br />or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?
3185516 3188644 - I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.<br />- Aah.
3190104 3192272 But not a poker face, Slick.
3204618 3205869 Hey, guys.
3206286 3209373 Uh, Dad's about to go down for the long nap.

3249163 3251165 Why are you in my dad's truck?
3251790 3253959 He wanted me to bring it for your brother.
3254710 3256879 He sent you a message.
3259965 3261967 She's pretty upset with him for leaving.
3262134 3266221 If you record any messages,<br />I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.
3267306 3269975 Murph is a bright spark.
3270976 3273520 Maybe I should fan the flame.
3273687 3276273 She's already making fools of her teachers.
3276440 3279276 So maybe she should come<br />and make a fool out of you.
3280360 3283197 - So where are they?<br />- Heading for Mars.
3283906 3287910 The next time you hear from Cooper,<br />they'll be coming up on Saturn.

3435724 3438769 This is the wormhole,<br />and every time we'd come around...

3475097 3476181 Thanks.
3481937 3483897 There, that's it! That's the wormhole!
3484064 3485857 Say it, don't spray it, Rom.
3486233 3487526 It's a sphere.
3487693 3491655 Of course it is. What, you...?<br />You thought it would just be a hole?
3492864 3495951 No, it's just that all the illustrations<br />I've ever seen, they...
3496493 3499579 ROMILLY: In the illustrations,<br />they're trying to show you how it works.
3500288 3504126 So they say you want to go<br />from here to there.
3504459 3507004 - But it's too far, right?<br />- Mm-hm.
3507170 3511967 So a wormhole bends space like this,<br />so you can take a shortcut through...
3512300 3513885 ...a higher dimension.
3514052 3515512 Okay, so...
3515846 3519766 ...to show that, they've turned<br />three-dimensional space into two dimensions...
3519933 3523895 ...which turns a wormhole<br />into two dimensions, a circle.
3524062 3526314 What's a circle in three dimensions?
3527524 3529026 - A sphere.<br />- Exactly.
3529443 3530944 A spherical hole.

3820817 3822485 No. It doesn't.
3822819 3824487 That's why there's a Plan B.
3826406 3827907 Okay. Cooper's right.
3828074 3831911 We need to think of time as a resource,<br />like oxygen and food. Going down will cost us.
3834289 3835457 All right, look.
3836750 3840211 Dr. Mann's data is promising,<br />but it will take months to get there.
3840378 3842589 And Edmunds', it's even further.
3842756 3846926 Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has<br />is very promising. It's water, it's organics...
3847093 3849262 - You don't find that every day.<br />- No, you don't.
3849429 3851765 And just think about the resources,<br />including time...
3851931 3854434 ...that would be spent<br />trying to get back here.
3855560 3857354 - Romilly...<br />- Yeah?
3857520 3861358 ...how far off from Miller's planet<br />do we have to be to stay out of the time shift?
3861524 3863193 Just back from the cusp.
3863360 3866321 All right, which is here,<br />just outside of Miller's planet.
3866488 3868281 ROMILLY: Right.<br />- Okay.
3869199 3871993 Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet.
3872160 3875330 Instead of taking the <i>Endurance</i> into orbit<br />around Miller's planet...
3875497 3878375 ...which would conserve fuel,<br />but we would lose a lot of time...
3878541 3882629 ...what if we take a wider orbit around<br />Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet...
3882796 3885298 ...outside of this time shift, to here?
3885465 3888259 Then we take the Ranger down,<br />we get Miller, we get her samples.
3888426 3891137 We come back, we analyze, we debrief.<br />We're in, we're out.
3891304 3893640 We lose a little fuel,<br />but we save a whole lot of time.
3893807 3895642 - That'll work.<br />- That's good.
3895809 3898269 There's no time for monkey business<br />or chit-chat down there.
3898436 3901231 So, TARS, you should definitely stay here.
3901398 3903650 CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay.
3903817 3907404 If we're talking about a couple years,<br />I could use the time to research gravity.
3907570 3910532 Observations from the wormhole,<br />that's gold to Professor Brand.
3910698 3912367 COOPER:<br />TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.
3912534 3917288 Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting,<br />but make sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.
3917455 3919999 - You got it?<br />TARS: I wouldn't leave you behind...
3920166 3921209 ...Dr. Brand.
3925880 3927507 COOPER: You ready, CASE?<br />CASE: Yup.
3928466 3931970 - You don't say much, do you?<br />- TARS talks plenty for both of us.
3933179 3934222 Detach.
3941521 3944482 - Romilly, are you reading these forces?<br />ROMILLY: <i>It's unbelievable.</i>
3947694 3949821 A literal heart of darkness.
3953992 3956703 If we could just see<br />the collapsed star inside...
3956870 3959622 ...the singularity, yeah, we'd solve gravity.
3960039 3963334 - And we can't get anything from it?<br /><i>- Nothing escapes that horizon.</i>
3963501 3964836 Not even light.
3965003 3968506 <i>- The answer's there, just no way to see it.</i><br />- There's Miller's planet.
3971176 3972510 Goodbye, Ranger.
3985315 3987609 CASE:<br />This is fast for atmospheric entry.
3987775 3990028 - Should we use the thrusters to slow?<br />- No.
3990487 3993823 I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics<br />to save some fuel.
3993990 3995200 CASE:<br />Air brake?
3995366 3998912 - We want to get down fast, don't we?<br />- We want to get there in one piece.
3999078 4002081 - Hang on.<br />CASE: Brand, Doyle, get ready.
4011299 4013259 [ALARMS BEEPING]
4017931 4020433 CASE: We should ease!<br />COOPER: Hands where I can see them.
4020600 4023937 The only time I went down was<br />when a machine was easing at the wrong time.
4024103 4026940 - A little caution...<br />- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.
4027106 4029275 - Cooper, it's too damn fast!<br />- I got this.
4034113 4038117 CASE: Should I disable the feedback?<br />- No. I need to feel the air.
4042121 4043289 Here we go.
4046584 4047877 It's just water!
4049379 4050880 The stuff of life.
4051339 4052757 CASE:<br />Twelve hundred meters.
4052924 4054968 - Do we have a fix on the beacon?<br />CASE: Got it!
4055134 4057762 - Can you maneuver?<br />- I'll need to shave some speed.
4057929 4060557 I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.<br />Everybody hang on!
4062976 4064018 CASE:<br />Seven hundred.
4066145 4068147 On my cue, CASE. On my cue.
4071651 4073152 CASE:<br />Five hundred meters.
4082620 4083663 Fire!
4097218 4098303 Very graceful.
4098469 4099554 No.
4100179 4102265 But very efficient.
4104726 4106936 What are you waiting for? Let's go!
4107103 4109022 Go, go, go!
4109439 4112692 Seven years per hour here.<br />Let's make it count!
4129834 4131544 [PANTING]
4138801 4140053 CASE:<br />This way.
4142889 4144641 About 200 meters.
4154150 4155777 The gravity's punishing.
4156736 4158863 Been floating through space too long?
4159030 4161074 CASE: One hundred and thirty percent<br />Earth gravity.
4161407 4163409 COOPER:<br />Come on. Come on.
4166037 4168873 - There's nothing here.<br />CASE: Should be right here.
4170792 4173795 If the signal's coming from here, then...
4183429 4184597 Her beacon.
4192730 4193773 DOYLE:<br />Wreckage.
4194440 4195608 <i>Where's the rest?</i>
4196109 4197610 Towards the mountains!
4201447 4203282 Those aren't mountains.
4204951 4206285 They're waves.
4211624 4214293 Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
4214794 4216796 COOPER:<br /><i>That one's moving away from us.</i>
4223302 4224971 AMELIA:<br />We need the recorder.
4235148 4237400 Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!
4237567 4240945 We're not leaving without her data.
4241112 4242447 Get back here now!
4242613 4244323 <i>We do not have time!</i>
4244490 4246951 The second wave is coming!<br />We're in the middle of a swell.
4248244 4249662 AMELIA:<br />No, I got it.
4249829 4251831 Get your ass back to the Ranger now!
4252665 4254000 [GRUNTING]
4256836 4258880 Brand, get back here now!
4260840 4263050 AMELIA:<br />No, Cooper, go. Cooper, go. I can't make it.
4263468 4265845 <i>- Go!</i><br />- CASE, go get her.
4270641 4272643 - Go!<br />- Get up. Get up, Brand!
4273561 4275062 DOYLE:<br />Go, go! Go!
4276647 4279484 - I'm not gonna make it!<br />- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!
4286324 4288618 Come on, CASE has her!<br />Get back here, Doyle!
4291621 4292705 Come on!
4295458 4296876 Get to the hatch!
4301422 4302924 Go, go! Go!
4308471 4309555 Shit.
4310056 4311891 Manually overriding inside hatch!
4315394 4316562 Cooper! Wait!
4323903 4327573 COOPER: The engines are flooded!<br />I'm gonna have to shut her down.
4332119 4333704 [AMELIA YELLING]
4361023 4362358 Holy shit.
4366779 4368114 Hang on!
4372827 4374328 [YELLING]
4399353 4400605 CASE, what's the problem?
4400771 4403190 Too waterlogged. Let it drain.
4404317 4405526 Goddamn it!
4405693 4410364 - I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?<br />- And I told you to get your ass back here!
4410531 4415202 - One of us was thinking about the mission!<br />- You were thinking about getting home.
4417038 4419373 I was trying to do the right thing!
4419540 4421500 Can you tell that to Doyle?
4423794 4425963 COOPER: CASE, how much time?<br />- Forty-five to an hour.
4427757 4429091 The stuff of life, huh?
4430009 4432178 What's this gonna cost us, Brand?
4432345 4434305 A lot. Decades.
4434472 4436098 [PANTING]
4438768 4440019 [GROANS]
4441520 4442855 What happened to Miller?
4443606 4446359 Judging by the wreckage, she was...
4446525 4449153 ...broken up by a wave soon after impact.
4449320 4452156 How's the wreckage stayed together<br />after all these years, huh?
4453407 4455409 Because of the time slippage.
4456535 4461040 On this planet's time,<br />she just landed hours ago.
4461958 4464335 She probably just died minutes ago.
4464502 4468547 CASE: The data Doyle received<br />was just the initial status echoing endlessly.
4468923 4471092 Oh, we are not prepared for this.
4473469 4476931 You eggheads have the survival skills<br />of a Boy Scout troop.
4477098 4480351 Well, we got this far on our brains.<br />Farther than any human in history.
4480518 4482103 Well, not far enough!
4482436 4485940 And now we're stuck here till there won't be<br />anyone left on Earth to save.
4488985 4491654 I'm counting every minute,<br />same as you, Cooper.
4496450 4498285 Is there any possibility...
4498452 4502081 ...some kind of a way<br />we can maybe all jump in a black hole?
4502248 4503916 Gain back the years?
4504583 4506085 Don't shake your head at me.
4506252 4508254 Time is relative, okay?
4508421 4511465 It can stretch and it can squeeze, but...
4511966 4514176 ...it can't run backwards. It just can't.
4514343 4518764 The only thing that can move across<br />dimensions, like time, is gravity.
4521475 4522643 Okay.
4524603 4528482 The beings that led us here,<br />they communicate...
4528649 4530484 - ...through gravity, right?<br />- Yes.
4530651 4532820 Could they be talking to us from the future?
4533738 4535990 - Maybe.<br />- Okay. If they can...
4537199 4540453 "They" are beings of five dimensions.
4540870 4544206 To them, time might be<br />another physical dimension.
4544540 4545875 To them...
4546292 4550463 ...the past might be a canyon<br />that they can climb into and the future...
4550629 4553632 ...a mountain they can climb up.<br />But to us, it's not, okay?
4554717 4557136 Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry.
4559305 4561057 But you knew about relativity.
4561223 4562558 Oh.
4564268 4565436 [SOFTLY]<br />Brand...
4567772 4569190 [SIGHS]
4570316 4572234 ...my daughter was 10 years old.
4572860 4575654 I couldn't teach her<br />Einstein's theories before I left.
4576072 4578908 Couldn't you have told her<br />you were going to save the world?
4579492 4580534 No.
4582203 4586373 When you become a parent,<br />one thing becomes really clear.
4587875 4591045 And that is that you want to make sure<br />your children feel safe.
4592088 4595841 And it rules out telling a 10-year-old<br />that the world is ending.
4598302 4599678 Cooper?
4600012 4602223 [DISTANT RUMBLING]
4603390 4605893 - How long for the engines, CASE?<br />- A minute or two.
4606060 4608145 We don't have it. Helmets on!
4612066 4613859 Brand, co-pilot, you're up.
4614026 4616529 CASE, blow the cabin oxygen<br />through the main thrusters!
4616695 4618405 - We're gonna spark it.<br />- Roger that.
4618697 4620032 - Locked.<br />- Depressurizing.
4625913 4627164 Engines up!
4656026 4657528 Hello, Rom.
4657987 4659655 I've waited years.
4660739 4662575 How...? How many years?
4664410 4667371 ROMILLY: By now it must be...<br />CASE: Twenty-three years...
4667538 4669248 ...four months, eight days.
4673669 4674837 Doyle?
4681051 4684054 I thought I was prepared. I knew the theory.
4685431 4686932 Reality's different.
4687975 4689143 And Miller?
4690728 4692730 There's nothing here for us.
4695482 4696984 Why didn't you sleep?
4697943 4702031 Oh, I had a couple of stretches.<br />But I stopped believing you were coming back.
4702531 4705534 And something seemed wrong<br />about dreaming my life away.
4706368 4709205 I learned what I could from the black hole...
4709580 4712041 ...but I couldn't send anything to your father.
4712208 4714460 We've been receiving, but nothing gets out.
4714627 4716712 AMELIA: Is he alive?<br />- Oh, yeah.
4717129 4718923 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah.

4914034 4916537 <i>I never made one of these<br />when you were still responding...</i>
4916703 4919039 <i>...because I was so mad at you for leaving.</i>
4922084 4924169 <i>And then when you went quiet, it...</i>
4926797 4929633 <i>...seemed like I should live with that decision.<br />And I have.</i>
4934138 4936557 <i>But today's my birthday.</i>
4940227 4943397 <i>And it's a special one,<br />because you told me...</i>
4947526 4951864 <i>You once told me that when you came back,<br />we might be the same age.</i>
4953574 4956660 <i>And today I'm the age you were<br />when you left.</i>

5005459 5008378 I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.
5009546 5011882 Them never coming back or...
5013091 5016303 ...coming back to find we've failed.
5016470 5017888 Then let's succeed.
5018931 5019973 So...
5020682 5024686 ...back to the fourth iteration.<br />Let's run it through some new fields.
5025020 5028190 With respect, professor,<br />we've tried that hundreds of times.
5028524 5032194 It only has to work once, Murph.
5035489 5039368 BRAND: Every rivet that they strike<br />could have been a bullet.
5039535 5041537 We've done well for the world here...
5041703 5046458 ...whether or not we crack the equation<br />before I kick the bucket.
5046625 5049503 - Don't be morbid, professor.<br />- I'm not afraid of death.
5050254 5052089 I'm an old physicist.
5053340 5055008 I'm afraid of time.
5062182 5063350 MURPH:<br />Time.
5065394 5067062 You're afraid of time.
5069648 5071650 We've been trying to solve the equation...
5071817 5074319 ...without changing<br />the underlying assumption about time.
5074486 5076196 - And?<br />- And that means...
5076363 5080826 ...each iteration is an attempt<br />to prove its own proof.
5080993 5083120 It's recursive. It's nonsensical.
5083412 5085330 Are you calling my life's work...
5085497 5087207 ...nonsense, Murph?
5087374 5089418 No, I'm saying that you've been trying to...
5089585 5093380 ...finish it with one arm... No, with both arms.<br />...tied behind your back.
5095465 5097467 And I don't understand why.
5098427 5100262 I'm an old man, Murph.
5101179 5103807 Can we take this point up at another time?
5103974 5106101 I want to talk to my daughter.
5108270 5110731 BRAND [ON RECORDING]:<br /><i>Stepping out into the universe...</i>
5110897 5114693 <i>...we must confront the reality<br />of interstellar travel.</i>
5115611 5120157 <i>We must reach far beyond<br />our own lifespans.</i>
5120324 5125454 <i>We must think not as individuals<br />but as a species.</i>
5128290 5130917 <i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>
5133086 5135672 COOPER: TARS kept the <i>Endurance</i><br />right where we needed her.
5135839 5138634 But the trip took years longer<br />than we anticipated.
5138967 5142471 We no longer have the fuel<br />to visit both prospects, so...
5142804 5144306 ...we have to choose.
5145515 5146642 But how?
5147684 5149353 They're both promising.
5150896 5155400 Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann<br />is the one still transmitting, so...
5155567 5158487 We've no reason to suspect<br />Edmunds's data would have soured.
5159404 5161907 His world has key elements<br />to sustain human life.
5162074 5165243 - As does Dr. Mann's.<br />- Cooper, this is my field.
5166411 5167454 And...
5168246 5170415 ...I really believe Edmunds'<br />is the better prospect.
5170582 5173919 - Why?<br />- Gargantua, that's why.
5175045 5179091 Look at Miller's planet.<br />Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...
5179257 5183679 ...but no life. Sterile.<br />We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
5184096 5185764 Because of the black hole?
5186056 5189101 Murphy's Law.<br />Whatever can happen will happen.
5189267 5191603 Accident is the first building block<br />of evolution.
5191770 5194606 But when you're orbiting a black hole<br />not enough can happen.
5194773 5199069 It sucks in asteroids and comets,<br />other events which would otherwise reach you.
5199444 5201279 We need to go further afield.
5201905 5204241 You once said that Dr. Mann...
5205492 5206993 ...was the best of us.
5207285 5210455 He's remarkable.<br />We're only here because of him.
5210997 5212833 And yet... Yet here he is.
5212999 5217963 He's on the ground, and he's sending<br />a very unambiguous message, telling us...
5218130 5219840 ...to come to his planet.
5220006 5224636 Granted, but Edmunds' data<br />is more promising.
5225095 5226138 We should vote.
5226304 5228473 Well, if we vote,<br />there's something you should know.
5229599 5230642 Brand?
5230809 5232477 He has a right to know.
5232978 5234730 That has nothing to do with it.
5234896 5237941 - What does?<br />- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.
5238108 5240652 ROMILLY: Is that true?<br />- Yes.
5243822 5246533 And that makes me want to follow my heart.
5249995 5253665 But maybe we've spent too long<br />trying to figure all this out with theory.
5253832 5255250 You're a scientist, Brand.
5255417 5256960 So listen to me...
5257794 5262507 ...when I say that love<br />isn't something we invented. It's...
5263508 5265844 ...observable, powerful.
5267929 5269639 It has to mean something.
5269806 5274186 Love has meaning, yes.<br />Social utility, social bonding, child rearing...
5274352 5277856 We love people who have died.<br />Where's the social utility in that?
5278398 5279441 None.
5279608 5283487 Maybe it means something more,<br />something we can't...
5283653 5285697 ...yet understand.
5285864 5289326 Maybe it's some evidence, some...
5290285 5294748 ...artifact of a higher dimension<br />that we can't consciously perceive.
5294915 5299711 I'm drawn across the universe<br />to someone I haven't seen in a decade...
5299878 5302714 ...who I know is probably dead.
5303048 5306384 Love is the one thing<br />we're capable of perceiving...
5306551 5309387 ...that transcends dimensions<br />of time and space.
5311223 5315560 Maybe we should trust that,<br />even if we can't understand it yet.
5320565 5322234 All right, Cooper...
5324110 5325403 ...yes...
5326571 5329908 ...the tiniest possibility<br />of seeing Wolf again excites me.
5330742 5332410 That doesn't mean I'm wrong.
5333119 5335288 Honestly, Amelia...
5337082 5338250 ...it might.
5345048 5347759 TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.
5364651 5366111 TOM:<br />We'll lose about a third again.
5366278 5367821 But next year...
5370115 5372951 Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm<br />and we'll make it up.
5373785 5375620 What happened to Nelson?
5381543 5383753 LOIS:<br /><i>Murph, would you like some more soufflé?</i>
5383920 5387299 Oh, no. I'm full, thanks. It was delicious.
5388174 5390176 Coop, finish your fritter, please.
5392345 5396057 Will you spend the night?<br />Your room is exactly as you left it. It's ready.
5396224 5397601 I need to get back.
5397767 5400312 LOIS: My sewing machine is in there,<br />but there's plenty...
5400478 5401771 I need to...
5404649 5406192 Too many memories.
5406818 5409613 We might have something for that.<br />Hey, Coop.
5414326 5415994 [COOP COUGHING]
5417162 5418455 The dust.
5420957 5423335 Lois, I have a friend who...
5423501 5425337 ...could look at his lungs.
5431676 5433428 [DISTANT RUMBLING]
5443521 5446191 COOPER: Amelia, I'm sorry.<br />- You were just being objective.
5446358 5449819 Unless you're punishing me<br />for screwing up on Miller's planet.
5449986 5452238 No, this wasn't a personal decision.
5453073 5457118 If you're wrong, you will have<br />a very personal decision to make.
5457285 5460246 Your fuel calculations<br />are based on a return journey.
5460580 5464459 Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have<br />to decide whether to return home...
5464751 5466878 ...or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.
5467212 5470882 Starting a colony could save us<br />from extinction.
5471216 5474386 You might have to decide<br />between seeing your children again...
5474552 5476388 ...and the future of the human race.
5477889 5479599 I trust you'll be as objective then.
5486481 5488400 He's been asking for you since he came to.
5488566 5490193 We were trying to reach you.
5496157 5497200 Murph.
5498201 5499703 I'm here, professor.
5500412 5502747 I let you all down.
5503081 5506418 No, you got us so far. Real close.
5508253 5510046 I'll finish what you started.
5510213 5512424 Good, good Murph.
5514718 5517012 You had faith...
5518221 5519514 ...all those...
5520473 5522267 ...all those years.
5523935 5525186 I...
5525353 5527856 I asked you to have faith.
5529607 5532402 I wanted you to believe...
5533903 5535780 ...that your father...
5538783 5540618 ...would come back.
5540785 5542078 I do, professor.
5543705 5545206 Forgive me, Murph.
5545957 5547959 There's nothing to forgive.
5550628 5551671 I...
5552255 5554090 I lied, Murph.
5556468 5558261 I lied to you.
5564601 5567812 There was no need for him to...
5569022 5570899 To come back.
5573485 5576821 There is no way to help us.
5578114 5579157 But Plan A...
5579699 5582827 All this. All these people.
5583953 5585747 And the equation.
5589751 5591503 Did my father know?
5595298 5597008 Did he leave me?
5600970 5602013 Do...
5603181 5604516 ...not...
5605475 5606726 ...go...

5611523 5612690 No.
5614359 5615443 No!
5616653 5618321 You can't leave.
5618696 5619948 You... No.

5626287 5627956 He was at peace.
5628623 5630708 I'm very sorry for your loss.

5647392 5649060 <i>He told you, right?</i>
5651938 5653314 <i>You knew.</i>
5655233 5657026 <i>This was all a sham.</i>

5904649 5907068 So far, surely.

5961956 5964959 Now, up here where I landed,<br />the water is alkali...
5965293 5969046 ...and the air has too much ammonia to breathe<br />for more than just a few minutes...
5969213 5973801 ...but down at the surface,<br />and there is a surface...
5973968 5975595 ...the chlorine dissipates.
5975761 5979640 The ammonia gives way to crystalline<br />hydrocarbons and breathable air.
5979974 5981476 To organics.
5981809 5984145 Possibly even to life.
5984979 5986898 We might be sharing this world.
5987440 5989400 These readings are from the surface?
5989567 5992737 Over the years, I've dropped various probes.
5993070 5996491 COOPER: How far have you explored?<br />- I've mounted several major expeditions.
5996657 6000912 But with oxygen in limited supply,<br />KIPP there really did most of the legwork.
6001078 6003539 TARS: What went wrong with him, sir?<br />MANN: Degeneration.
6003706 6007293 He misidentified the first organics<br />we found as ammonia crystals.
6007460 6011589 We struggled on for a time,<br />but ultimately I decommissioned him and...
6011756 6013925 ...used his power source<br />to keep the mission going.
6014091 6017094 I thought I was alone<br />before I shut him down.

6144722 6146599 Then why wouldn't he use it?
6146766 6150728 The equation couldn't reconcile relativity<br />with quantum mechanics. You need more.

6261547 6263382 Let me go home.
6263966 6265885 MAN:<br />You're absolutely positive?
6266510 6269013 His solution was correct.<br />He'd had it for years.
6269680 6272308 - It's worthless?<br />- It's half the answer.
6273267 6276270 Okay, how do you find the other half?
6276854 6278522 Out there? A black hole.
6278689 6281525 - But stuck down here on Earth?<br />- Yeah?
6282860 6284528 I'm not sure you can.
6286447 6289116 MAN:<br />God, they just pack up and leave.
6290534 6292620 What are they hoping to find?
6293204 6294246 Survival.
6302046 6303130 Damn it.
6306050 6309845 Murph, don't...?<br />Don't people have a right to know?
6310471 6314558 Panic won't help.<br />We just have to keep working, same as ever.
6314725 6318062 But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand<br />was manipulating us to do?
6318229 6321482 Brand gave up on us.<br />I'm still trying to solve this.
6322107 6323192 So...
6324610 6326278 ...do you have an idea?
6326987 6328322 A feeling.
6331742 6333744 <i>I told you about my ghost.</i>
6335746 6337790 <i>My dad thought I called it a ghost...</i>
6338249 6339917 ...because I was scared of it.
6343379 6344713 But I was never scared of it.
6346924 6349593 <i>I called it a ghost because it felt...</i>
6352012 6353681 It felt like a person.
6356225 6357893 It was trying to tell me something.
6360855 6363858 If there's an answer here on Earth,<br />it's back there...
6364316 6366235 ...somehow, in that room.
6366777 6368529 So I have to find it.
6371949 6373701 We're running out of time.
6375619 6377621 CASE:<br /><i>What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?</i>
6377788 6379957 COOPER: No, they can stay.<br />I'll be sleeping anyway.
6380124 6381709 - Hey, Coop?<br />- Yeah?
6381876 6383878 I have a suggestion for your return journey.
6384044 6386797 - Yeah, what's that?<br />- Have one last crack at the black hole.
6388674 6390259 I'm going home, Rom.
6390426 6393679 Yeah, I know.<br />This isn't going to cost you any time.
6394430 6396265 There's a chance for the people on Earth.
6397016 6400060 - Talk to me.<br />- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.
6400227 6404106 - It's what we call a gentle singularity.<br />- Gentle?
6404273 6407735 They're hardly gentle.<br />But the tidal gravity is so quick that...
6407902 6412156 ...something crossing the horizon fast<br />might survive. A probe, say.
6412323 6416994 - What happens after it crosses?<br />- After the horizon is a complete mystery.
6417161 6420247 So, what's to say<br />there isn't some way that the probe...
6420414 6423334 ...can glimpse the singularity<br />and relay the quantum data?
6423500 6426754 If he's equipped to transmit<br />every form of energy that can pulse.
6426921 6429715 TARS: Just when did this probe<br />become a "he," professor?
6430257 6432009 TARS is the obvious candidate.
6432843 6434762 I've already told him what to look for.
6434929 6437640 I'd need the old optical transmitter<br />off KIPP, Cooper.
6437806 6439141 You'd do this for us?
6439308 6443228 Before you get all teary, remember that<br />as a robot I have to do anything you say.
6444146 6445606 Your cue light's broken.
6445773 6447316 I'm not joking.
6449944 6453197 I'll need TARS to remove and adapt<br />some components from KIPP.
6453364 6455699 I don't want to disturb his archival functions.
6455866 6457368 I'll supervise.
6457701 6458744 All right.
6458911 6463582 Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure sites.<br />One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.
6463749 6466210 Once those modules have landed,<br />you don't want to move them.
6466377 6468921 I can take you to the probe sites,<br />but I don't think...
6469088 6471799 ...these conditions will hold.<br />I think we should wait.
6471966 6474802 COOPER: CASE is headed down<br />with the rest of the distillery equipment.
6474969 6477805 I'd really like to secure those sites by nightfall.
6479723 6482810 Well, these squalls do usually blow over.
6483227 6484353 Okay, then.
6484520 6486730 - You'll need a long-range transmitter.<br />- Got it.
6486897 6488440 - Are you charged?<br />- Yeah.
6489024 6490067 Follow me.
6490859 6493028 TARS, 72 hours, yeah?
6493195 6494405 Roger that, Cooper.
6500703 6503747 MANN: Brand told me why you feel<br />you have to go back.
6505582 6508335 But I'd be remiss<br />if I didn't at least mention...
6508669 6512840 ...that a mission such as ours<br />could certainly use an extra engineer.
6514675 6518929 You better slow down, turbo.<br />Safety first, CASE, remember.
6519555 6521306 CASE:<br /><i>Safety first, Cooper.</i>
6522558 6525561 COOPER: I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,<br />I'm honored to be a part of this.
6525936 6530941 But once we set up base camp and secure<br />those modules, my work's done here.
6531358 6532693 I'm going home.
6534153 6536155 [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
6540701 6544204 You have attachments.<br />But even without a family...
6544621 6549084 ...I can promise you that that yearning<br />to be with other people is powerful.
6549752 6553088 That emotion is at the foundation...
6553756 6556800 ...of what makes us human.<br />It's not to be taken lightly.
6562765 6564349 [LOIS COUGHING]
6564808 6567394 - How long have you had that cough?<br />- A while.
6577946 6579865 COOP:<br />Mom lets me play in here.
6581784 6583035 I don't touch your stuff.
6584578 6586246 [WHIRRING]
6614024 6615651 Just take this gently.
6620781 6624159 You know why we couldn't just send machines<br />on these missions, don't you?
6624785 6629414 A machine doesn't improvise well<br />because you can't program a fear of death.
6630290 6632626 Our survival instinct is our single greatest...

6637047 6638382 A father...
6638882 6641885 ...with a survival instinct<br />that extends to your kids.
6643053 6647724 What does research tell us is the last thing<br />you're going to see before you die?
6649434 6651895 Your children. Their faces.
6652229 6654815 At the moment of death,<br />your mind's gonna push...
6654982 6656692 ...a little bit harder to survive.
6657401 6658443 For them.
6659319 6660571 Deep breath.
6662865 6666618 Uh, hey. I bet you're Coop.<br />Why don't you have a seat here for me?
6666910 6669246 It's bad. They cannot stay here.
6669955 6671248 - Okay?<br />- Yeah.
6679590 6681049 ROMILLY:<br />TARS, what's taking so long?
6681216 6684094 TARS: Professor, I am having trouble<br />completing the boot up.

6702696 6704031 The truth is...
6706241 6711246 ...I never really considered the possibility<br />that my planet wasn't the one.
6713957 6716293 Nothing worked out the way<br />it was supposed to.
6716460 6717502 COOPER:<br />Let's go.
6723634 6725093 [YELLS]
6725969 6728764 All right, buddy, give me a big deep breath.
6733560 6734978 What is this?
6735395 6739233 - What are you doing?<br />- I'm sorry! I can't let you leave with that ship.
6739566 6741902 We're gonna need it<br />to complete the mission...
6742236 6745656 ...once the others realize<br />what this place isn't.
6745948 6748700 We cannot survive here. I'm sorry!

9234392 9236769 No. No, not yet.
9237145 9238604 But one day.
9239272 9242483 Not you and me. But people.
9243151 9247196 A civilization that's evolved past<br />the four dimensions we know.
9253786 9255288 COOPER:<br /><i>What happens now?</i>
9314514 9316224 [BIRDS CHIRPING]
9317892 9319352 MAN:<br />Mr. Cooper.
9323564 9325274 All right. Let's take it slow, sir.
9325691 9327819 Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.
9327985 9333032 Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.<br />Actually, you are 124 years old.
9336369 9338037 [CHEERING OUTSIDE]
9340039 9341374 Take it slow, sir.
9342291 9344585 You were, uh, extremely lucky.
9344919 9348256 The Rangers found you with only minutes<br />left in your oxygen supply.
9356681 9358933 [GLASS SHATTERS<br />AND KIDS CHEER]
9362436 9363771 Where am I?
9365439 9366983 Cooper Station.
9368401 9369944 Currently orbiting Saturn.
9371946 9373990 Cooper Station.
9376450 9378452 Nice of you to name it after me.
9378619 9379662 [LAUGHS]
9382290 9383374 What?
9383541 9386752 The station isn't named after you, sir.<br />It's, uh, named after your daughter.
9387253 9390256 Although she's always maintained<br />just how important you were.
9390423 9392133 Is she still alive?
9394093 9395970 She'll be here in a couple weeks.
9397013 9399473 She is far too old to be transferring<br />from another station...
9399640 9402018 ...but when she heard<br />that you'd been found...
9403227 9405938 ...well, this is, uh, Murphy Cooper<br />we're talking about.
9406814 9408316 Yes, it is.
9410443 9412945 We'll have you checked out of here<br />in a couple days.
9415615 9418117 I'm sure you'll be excited to see<br />what's in store.
9419368 9423331 I actually, uh, did a paper on you<br />in high school.
9423664 9426000 I know all about your life back on Earth.
9427668 9428836 Oh, yeah.
9429003 9430254 Right.
9432673 9438012 If... If you'll follow me,<br />we've got a really good situation for you.
9441349 9445394 So, uh, when I made my suggestion<br />to Miss Cooper...
9446312 9449106 ...I was delighted to hear<br />that she thought it was perfect.
9452485 9455780 WOMAN 1 [ON TV]: <i>It was just constant.<br />Just that steady blow of dirt.</i>
9455947 9458866 Of course, I didn't speak to her personally.
9459033 9461035 MAN 1:<br /><i>We always set the plate upside-down.</i>
9461202 9463955 <i>Glasses or cups,<br />whatever it was, upside-down.</i>
9464121 9469043 <i>Well, my dad was a farmer.<br />Uh, like everybody else back then.</i>
9469210 9471671 <i>There just wasn't enough food.</i>
9471837 9474548 WOMAN 2:<br /><i>We wore little things, little strips...</i>
9474715 9479887 <i>...of sheet over our nose and mouth<br />so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.</i>
9480054 9483516 <i>Well, it was pretty exciting for me<br />because it was hope.</i>
9483683 9487895 MAN 2: <i>I don't care who describes it, there is<br />no way for it to be exaggerated. It was that bad.</i>
9488062 9491732 MAN: She did confirm<br />just how much you loved farming.
9492066 9493734 - Oh, she did, did she?<br />- Yeah.
9493901 9495111 Come here.
9495695 9500658 Home sweet home.<br />Everything replaced and put back where it...
9500825 9502910 [INTERVIEWEES CONTINUE<br />SPEAKING IN BACKGROUND]
9507039 9509083 - Hey, is this...?<br />- Oh, yeah.
9509250 9512253 The machine we found out near Saturn<br />when we found you. Yes.
9512420 9515089 Its, uh, power source was shot,<br />but we could get you another one.
9515256 9517425 Yes. Please.

9552543 9555629 - Knock-knock.<br />- You want 55?
9560509 9562636 Is this really what it was like?
9564847 9567266 It was never this clean, Slick. Heh.
9571771 9575441 I don't care much for this pretending<br />we're back where we started.
9577526 9579820 I want to know where we are.
9581447 9582990 <i>Where we're going.</i>
9587536 9590623 - Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.<br />- Yeah.
9590790 9591874 Family?
9592041 9595920 Yeah, they all came out to see her.<br />She's been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.
9612478 9614271 [FAMILY EXITS ROOM]
9628994 9630871 You told them I like farming.
9631038 9632706 [BOTH LAUGH]
9636836 9638504 It was me, Murph.
9640965 9642758 I was your ghost.
9644051 9645678 I know.
9647471 9652184 People didn't believe me.<br />They thought that I was doing it all myself.
9652351 9653394 But...
9656272 9658232 ...I knew who it was.
9663195 9665364 Nobody believed me.
9665865 9668284 But I knew you'd come back.
9670870 9672079 How?
9674081 9677209 Because my dad promised me.
9683257 9685259 Well, I'm here now, Murph.
9686552 9687887 I'm here.
9689346 9690681 No.
9692766 9696896 No parent should have to watch<br />their own child die.
9699815 9702484 I have my kids here for me now.
9705279 9706780 You go.
9709700 9711202 Where?
9714705 9716290 Brand.
9726133 9727760 MURPH:<br /><i>She's out there...</i>
9734183 9735935 <i>...setting up camp.</i>
9762419 9764129 <i>Alone...</i>
9765297 9767967 <i>...in a strange galaxy.</i>
9778852 9783524 <i>Maybe right now<br />she's settling in for the long nap...</i>
