69040 70720 Well, my dad was a farmer.
72600 74520 Like everybody else back then.
76720 78360 Of course, he didn't start that way.
84400 85720 <i>Computer says you're too tight.</i>
86120 87400 Nah, I got this.
87880 89000 <i>Crossing the Straights.</i>
91240 93120 - <i>Shutting it down, Cooper.</i><br />- No!
94440 95440 <i>Shutting it all down.</i>
95520 96840 No, I need power up!
101000 102000 Dad?
108200 110680 Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.
111040 113440 - I thought you were the ghost.<br />- No.
115200 117120 There are no such things<br />as ghosts, babe.
117200 119000 Grandpa says you can get ghosts.
120480 124880 Maybe that's because Grandpa's close<br />to being one himself. Back to bed.
125360 127120 Were you dreaming about the crash?
128600 130520 Get your butt back in bed, Murph.
156800 158120 The wheat had died.
158880 160880 The blight came<br />and we had to burn it.
161600 164640 And we still had corn.<br />We had acres of corn.
164720 166840 But mostly we had dust.
169280 171920 I guess I can't describe it.<br />It was just constant.
172000 175320 Just that steady blow of dirt.
177720 180520 We wore little strips of sheet
180600 183320 sometimes over our nose and mouth
183400 185640 so that we wouldn't<br />breathe so much of it.
187440 189000 When we set the table
189080 191040 we always set the plate upside-down.
191120 193760 Glasses or cups,<br />whatever it was upside-down.
199480 202360 - Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!<br />- Tom, four o'clock today
202440 205000 you and me in the barn,<br />Herbicide Resistance 101.
205080 206320 - Check?<br />- Yes, sir.
208040 209240 Not at the table, Murph.
210400 211880 Dad, can you fix this?
213720 215096 What the heck did you do<br />to my lander?
215120 216120 Wasn't me.
216280 218240 Let me guess. It was your ghost?
218320 220600 It knocked it off my shelf.<br />It keeps knocking books off.
220680 222040 No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.
222120 223440 - Hey.<br />- I looked it up.
223520 224560 It's called a poltergeist.
224600 225640 Dad, tell her.
225720 228040 Well, it's not<br />very scientific, Murph.
228120 230320 You said science was about<br />admitting what we don't know.
230520 231560 She's got you there.
231640 234000 Hey. Start looking after our stuff.
235560 236560 Coop.
239200 241440 All right, Murph,<br />you want to talk science?
242520 244416 Don't just tell me that<br />you're afraid of some ghost.
244440 245600 No, you got to go further.
245680 248480 You gotta record the facts, analyze,<br />get to the how and the why
248560 251480 then present your conclusions. Deal?
252240 253680 - Deal.<br />- All right.
256400 258200 - Have a good day at school.<br />- Hold up.
258640 261000 Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.
261200 262560 Not grandparent.
265200 266560 Slow down, turbo!
268200 269280 That's not a dust storm.
269760 271320 Nelson's torching his whole crop.
271480 272480 Blight?
272560 274760 They're saying<br />it's the last harvest for okra.
275840 276840 Ever.
278800 281120 He should've planted corn<br />like the rest of us.
281520 284120 Now, you be nice<br />to that Miss Hanley. She's single.
284200 285400 What's that supposed to mean?
285720 287000 Repopulating the earth.
287080 288600 Start pulling your weight, young man.
288680 292800 Why don't you start<br />minding your own business, old man?
299720 301040 All right, Murph, give me second.
304720 305920 Third.
307480 308680 Find a gear, dumb-ass.
308760 310280 - Grind it!<br />- Shut it, Tom!
311560 312640 What'd you do, Murph?
312720 315560 She didn't do nothing.<br />Blew a tire is all.
315640 316640 Murphy's Law.
317160 318160 Shut up!
318240 319240 Grab the spare, Tom.
319320 320320 That is the spare.
322880 324000 Get the patch kit.
325480 326936 How am I supposed<br />to patch it out here?
326960 328320 You gotta figure it out.
328680 330280 I'm not always gonna<br />be here to help you.
338720 340320 What's going on, Murph?
340600 343200 Why did you and Mom name me<br />after something that's bad?
343720 344760 We didn't.
345320 346640 Murphy's Law?
347920 351800 Murphy's Law doesn't mean<br />that something bad will happen.
351880 355120 What it means is<br />whatever can happen will happen.
355200 357160 And that sounded just fine with us.
364040 365040 Get in.
366480 367480 Get in, let's go.
369040 371000 What about the flat tire?
373880 374920 Yeah.
388480 390160 It's an Indian Air Force drone.
390240 392400 Solar cells could<br />power an entire farm.
392480 393560 Take the wheel, Tom.
399120 400200 Go, go, go!
402080 403480 Keep that aimed right at it.
411400 413240 Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.
414320 415360 Right at it.
417040 418080 Stay on it.
419600 420600 Here we go.
429160 430200 Nice one, Tom.
437040 438040 Dad?
438560 440880 I almost got it. Don't stop...
441600 442640 Dad!
442880 443880 Tom!
448400 450320 You told me to keep driving.
451440 452560 I guess that answers
452640 455360 the old "if I asked you<br />to drive off a cliff" scenario.
458760 461240 - We lost it.<br />- No, we didn't.
473800 475120 Want to give it a whirl?
481120 482120 This way.
487560 488560 Go.
489480 492440 Let's lay her down right there<br />at the edge of the reservoir.
496480 497960 Nicely done.
501320 502800 How long you think<br />it's been up there?
503000 505400 Delhi Mission Control went down,<br />same as ours
505560 506560 ten years ago.
507720 509080 So for ten years?
512520 513640 Why did it come down so low?
513720 514760 I don't know.
515120 518000 Maybe the sun cooked its brain<br />or it was looking for something.
518080 520160 - What?<br />- Give me a large flatblade.
520600 523200 Maybe some kind of signal?<br />I don't know.
528440 529640 What are you gonna do with it?
530440 533120 I'm gonna give it something<br />socially responsible to do...
534520 535760 like drive a combine.
536440 537600 Can't we just let it go?
539880 541320 It wasn't hurting anybody.
543000 545120 This thing needs to learn<br />how to adapt, Murph
545760 547000 like the rest of us.
551760 553480 How's this work? You guys come with?
553560 554600 I've got class.
554720 556880 This one needs to wait.
558640 559640 What did you do?
559720 561296 They'll tell you about it<br />when you get in there.
561320 563320 - What, am I gonna be mad?<br />- Not with me.
563400 566240 - Just please try not to.<br />- Hey. Relax.
568000 569000 I got this.
573520 574600 Little late, Coop.
574880 576200 Yeah, we had a flat.
576480 579920 And I guess you had to stop off<br />at the Asian fighter plane store.
580000 583480 No, actually, sir, that's a...<br />that's a surveillance drone.
583680 586000 With outstanding solar cells.<br />It's Indian.
586720 587720 Take a seat.
589080 590360 So...
591120 593200 we got Tom's scores back.
594240 596120 He's gonna make an excellent farmer.
596200 599200 Yeah, he's got a knack for it.<br />What about college?
599880 602080 Well, the university<br />only takes a handful.
602160 603576 They don't really have<br />the resources to...
603600 605040 I still pay my taxes.
605920 608160 Where's that money go?<br />There's no more armies.
608240 610160 Well, it doesn't go<br />to the university.
611320 612800 Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.
612840 615120 You're ruling my son<br />out for college now?
616000 617040 The kid's 15.
617160 619520 Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
620320 621480 What's your waistline?
621560 622680 About what, 32?
622760 624400 About a 33 inseam?
624720 626136 I'm not sure I see<br />what you're getting at.
626160 627376 Are you tellin' me<br />it takes two numbers
627400 628600 to measure your own ass
628680 630720 but only one to measure<br />my son's future?
631560 632560 Come on.
632800 634440 You're a well-educated man, Coop.
634520 636480 - And a trained pilot.<br />- And an engineer.
636880 641120 Okay, well, right now<br />we don't need more engineers.
642000 644640 We didn't run out of<br />television screens and planes.
644720 645880 We ran out of food.
646360 649600 The world needs farmers.<br />Good farmers, like you.
649680 651760 - And Tom.<br />- Uneducated farmers.
653040 656720 We're a caretaker generation, Coop.<br />And things are getting better.
656800 658520 Maybe your grandkids<br />will get to be engin...
658560 659560 Are we done here, sir?
661160 662200 No.
663040 665000 Miss Hanley's here<br />to talk about Murph.
665400 667880 Murph is a great kid.<br />She's really bright.
667960 669576 But she's been having<br />a little trouble lately.
669600 671920 She brought this in<br />to show the other students.
672000 673520 The section on the lunar landings.
673600 675720 Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.
676520 678480 She always loved the pictures.
678560 679720 It's an old federal textbook.
679760 681800 We've replaced them<br />with the corrected versions.
682400 683400 Corrected?
683560 685520 Explaining how<br />the Apollo missions were faked
685600 687200 to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
694200 695800 You don't believe<br />we went to the moon?
696920 698840 I believe it was<br />a brilliant piece of propaganda.
698920 700720 That the Soviets<br />bankrupted themselves
700800 703800 pouring resources into rockets<br />and other useless machines.
704080 705200 "Useless machines."
705280 706960 And if we don't want<br />a repeat of the excess
707000 708800 and wastefulness of the 20th century
708880 712720 then we need to teach our kids about<br />this planet, not tales of leaving it.
713840 717320 Yeah, one of those useless machines<br />they used to make was called an MRI.
718320 719800 And if we had any of those left
719880 721136 the doctors would've<br />been able to find
721160 722880 the cyst in my wife's brain
722960 725120 before she died<br />instead of afterwards.
725200 726656 And then she'd have been<br />the one sitting here
726680 728280 listening to this instead of me
728360 730920 which would have been a good thing,<br />because she was always the...
731800 733040 the calmer one.
733920 735560 I'm sorry about your wife,<br />Mr. Cooper.
737080 740160 But Murph got into a fistfight<br />with several of her classmates
740240 742200 over this Apollo nonsense.
742800 744856 So we thought it would be best<br />to bring you in and see what ideas
744880 747336 you might have for dealing<br />with her behavior on the home front.
747360 748360 All right.
748760 750160 Yeah, you know what?
750240 751880 There's a game tomorrow night.
751960 754000 She's going through<br />a bit of a baseball phase.
754080 755360 Her favorite team is playing.
755440 757800 There's gonna be<br />candy and soda and...
761120 762760 I think I'll take her to that.
768000 769000 How'd it go?
770200 771720 I got you suspended.
772160 773400 - What?<br />- <i>Cooper.</i>
775160 776160 This is Cooper. Go.
776480 779080 <i>Coop, those combines you rebuilt<br />went haywire.</i>
779400 781240 Just reset the controllers.
781800 783800 <i>I did that.<br />Now you should come take a look.</i>
803240 805920 One by one they've been peeling off<br />the fields and heading over.
806280 808120 Something's interfering<br />with the compass.
809400 811440 Magnetism or some such.
853120 855120 Nothing special about which book.
855200 857000 I've been working on it,<br />like you said.
858040 859200 I counted the spaces.
859480 860520 Why?
862400 864080 In case the ghost is trying<br />to communicate.
865240 866360 I'm trying Morse.
867200 868200 Morse?
868800 869800 Yeah.
870240 871320 Dots and dashes, used...
871400 872840 I know what Morse code is, Murph.
872920 875320 I just don't think your bookshelf's<br />trying to talk to you.
886880 890800 Had to reset every compass clock<br />and GPS to offset for the anomaly.
891360 892360 Which is?
892560 893560 I don't know.
895520 897520 I mean, if the house was built<br />on magnetic ore
897600 900040 we'd have seen this the first time<br />we switched on the tractor.
903240 905800 I hear your meeting at the school<br />didn't go so well.
907640 908640 You heard?
909360 911800 It's like we've forgotten<br />who we are, Donald.
913640 916880 Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.
918840 920120 When I was a kid
920200 923120 it felt like they made<br />something new every day.
923200 928000 Some gadget or idea.<br />Like every day was Christmas.
928240 932920 But six billion people<br />just try to imagine that.
934120 936720 And every last one of them<br />trying to have it all.
940200 941800 This world isn't so bad.
944360 946040 And Tom will do just fine.
946120 947840 You're the one who doesn't belong.
947920 950920 Born 40 years too late,<br />or 40 years too early.
951760 953720 My daughter knew it, God bless her.
954880 957320 And your kids know it.<br />Especially Murph.
957960 960720 Well, we used to look up<br />in the sky and wonder
961400 963400 at our place in the stars.
965960 970280 Now we just look down and<br />worry about our place in the dirt.
970640 973000 Cooper, you were good at something
973720 976120 and you never got a chance<br />to do anything with it.
976840 977880 I'm sorry.
979800 983720 You didn't expect this dirt<br />that was giving you this food
984040 986960 to turn on you like that<br />and destroy you.
987240 991640 In April... I believe I'm right...<br />15th of April, I think.
991720 994800 This... 'cause this happened<br />about 1.30pm when that thing came off
994880 996200 the top of that canyon.
997800 999720 In my day, we had real ballplayers.
1000080 1001320 Who are these bums?
1002240 1003920 Yeah, well, in my day,<br />people were too busy
1004000 1005920 fighting over food<br />to even play baseball.
1006720 1009200 Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.
1010040 1011200 I want a hot dog.
1011280 1013320 School says you're gonna follow<br />in my footsteps.
1014400 1015520 I think that's great.
1016040 1017360 You think that's great?
1017440 1018920 You hate farming, Dad.
1020000 1021000 Grandpa said.
1021520 1022760 Grandpa said, huh?
1023600 1025640 Listen, all that matters<br />is how you feel about it.
1026160 1027400 I like what you do.
1028280 1029520 I like our farm.
1030440 1031760 You're gonna be great at it.
1044520 1045560 Let's get out of here.
1052920 1054400 All right, it's a doozy.
1055280 1056800 All right, gang, let's mask up.
1060280 1062160 - Tom? Murph? Check?<br />- Yeah.
1113560 1115680 Murph, Tom,<br />you guys shut your windows?
1120080 1121080 Murph?
1141800 1142840 The ghost.
1144120 1145320 Grab your pillow.
1146320 1147680 You're sleeping in with Tom.
1200800 1202120 It's not a ghost.
1207560 1208680 It's gravity.
1210920 1212880 I'm dropping Tom,<br />then heading to town.
1213320 1214600 You want to clean that up
1215520 1217080 when you've finished praying to it?
1241640 1244240 It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.
1244320 1246760 Thick is one, thin is zero.
1250600 1251640 Coordinates.
1254360 1255360 Nope.
1258320 1259320 Here we go.
1260960 1262000 33.
1264960 1265960 That's it.
1267160 1268560 I can't miss this.
1268880 1270056 - Come on!<br />- Grandpa will be back
1270080 1271560 in a couple hours, Murph.
1272680 1274720 But you don't know<br />what you're gonna find.
1276240 1277280 And that...
1278520 1280200 is why I can't take you.
1286400 1287400 Murph?
1289400 1292400 Grandpa will be home in a while.<br />Tell him I'll call him on the radio.
1299200 1300240 Jesus.
1301000 1302000 What are you doing?
1302880 1305200 You think this is funny? Huh?
1305280 1307000 You wouldn't be here<br />if it wasn't for me.
1309320 1310800 Make yourself useful.
1372000 1373040 Hey, Murph?
1374760 1375760 Murph.
1379120 1380880 I think this is the end of the road.
1384240 1386000 Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?
1387400 1388640 That's my girl.
1415040 1416560 - Step away from the fence!<br />- No...
1416640 1418200 Don't shoot...! I'm not armed.
1418480 1419640 My daughter's in the car.
1425200 1426200 Don't be afraid.
1439160 1440720 How did you find this place?
1441960 1443080 Where's my daughter?
1443520 1445960 You had the coordinates for<br />this facility marked on your map.
1446040 1447256 Where did you get those coordinates?
1447280 1448480 Where's my daughter?
1448560 1449856 Don't make me take you down again.
1449880 1451000 Sit down!
1451920 1454000 You still think you're a Marine, pal?
1454080 1456200 Marines don't exist anymore.
1456880 1460120 And I got grunts like you<br />mowing my grass.
1460200 1461680 Where did you find those coordinates?
1461800 1463880 Yeah, but you don't look<br />much like a lawnmower.
1464360 1467240 Think I'll turn you into<br />an overqualified vacuum cleaner.
1467320 1468320 No, you won't.
1470120 1471920 TARS, back down, please.
1473360 1476680 You know, you're taking a risk<br />using ex-military security.
1476760 1480520 They're old, and their control units<br />are unpredictable.
1480720 1482360 It's what the government could spare.
1484200 1485200 Who are you?
1485680 1486680 Dr. Brand.
1487200 1489920 I knew a Dr. Brand once.<br />He was a professor.
1490000 1491200 What makes you think I'm not?
1491600 1493560 Wasn't near as cute, either.
1494160 1496680 Please, Dr. Brand.<br />I don't have any idea what this is.
1497520 1499920 Now I'm scared for my daughter<br />and I want her by my side.
1500000 1502320 You give me that, I'll tell you<br />anything you want to know.
1505760 1508240 Get the principals and the girl<br />in the conference room, please.
1509960 1511080 Your daughter is fine.
1511680 1512720 Bright kid.
1513040 1514720 Must have a very smart mother.
1514800 1517360 It's pretty clear<br />you don't want any visitors.
1517440 1519136 So why don't you just let us<br />back up from your fence
1519160 1521320 and we'll be on our way, huh?
1521560 1522600 It's not that simple.
1522680 1524120 Well, sure, it is.
1524280 1525536 I don't know anything about you.
1525560 1527360 I don't know anything<br />about this place.
1528600 1529600 Yes, you do.
1535200 1536200 Dad!
1539000 1540120 Hello, Cooper.
1541400 1542400 Professor Brand.
1543720 1546120 Explain to me<br />how you found this facility.
1546440 1547536 Kind of an accident. We sort of
1547560 1549240 stumbled upon it.<br />We were on a salvage run
1549320 1550376 - we came across the fence...<br />- You're sitting in
1550400 1552280 the best-kept secret in the world.
1552360 1555560 Nobody stumbles in here.<br />Nobody stumbles out.
1556080 1557760 Cooper, please.
1558080 1559760 Cooperate with these people.
1560200 1561200 Look.
1562360 1563880 It's kinda hard to explain.
1564240 1569080 Now, we... we learned<br />these coordinates from an anomaly.
1569160 1570200 What sort of anomaly?
1570280 1573560 I hesitate to term it supernatural,<br />but it definitely wasn't scientific.
1573640 1575480 - Usually...<br />- You're gonna have to be specific
1575520 1577560 Mr. Cooper. Right now.
1577640 1578680 It was gravity.
1583640 1585480 - What sort of gravitational anomaly?<br />- No
1585560 1586640 - Where was this?<br />- No, hey.
1586680 1589200 Now, I'm real happy that<br />you're excited about gravity, bud
1589280 1592640 but you're not getting any answers<br />from us until I get assurances.
1592720 1594240 - Assurances?<br />- Yeah.
1595360 1596800 Like that we're getting out of here.
1597080 1598720 And I don't mean<br />in the trunk of some car.
1601000 1602800 Don't you know who we are, Coop?
1603120 1604320 No, Professor, I don't.
1604400 1606200 You know my father, Professor Brand.
1607080 1608080 We're NASA.
1609960 1611000 NASA?
1611080 1612080 NASA.
1612400 1614520 The same NASA you flew for.
1624840 1628200 I heard they shut you down, sir,<br />for refusing to drop bombs
1628280 1630320 from the stratosphere<br />onto starving people.
1630640 1632760 When they realized<br />that killing other people was
1632840 1635760 not a long-term solution,<br />then they needed us back.
1635840 1637680 - In secret.<br />- Why secret?
1637920 1641720 Because public opinion wouldn't<br />allow spending on space exploration.
1641800 1644200 Not while you're struggling<br />to put food on the table.
1645520 1646520 Blight.
1647040 1651000 Wheat seven years ago.<br />Okra this year.
1651480 1652920 Now there's just corn.
1653600 1655280 And we're growing<br />more than we ever have.
1655360 1659200 But like the potatoes in Ireland<br />and the wheat in the Dust Bowl
1660000 1662200 the corn will die.
1663160 1664160 Soon.
1669400 1672560 We'll find a way, professor.<br />We always have.
1673680 1677120 Driven by the unshakable faith<br />the Earth is ours.
1677800 1679360 Not just ours, no.
1680480 1681600 But it is our home.
1682880 1686200 Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen.
1686280 1687920 We don't even breathe nitrogen.
1688120 1692880 Blight does. And as it thrives,<br />our air gets less and less oxygen.
1693400 1696640 The last people to starve<br />will be the first to suffocate.
1696960 1698840 And your daughter's generation...
1700360 1702360 will be the last to survive on Earth.
1702880 1704280 Murph is feeling a little tired.
1704360 1706520 I was wondering<br />if she could take a nap in my office.
1706600 1708000 Yeah. Thank you.
1710840 1711840 Okay
1712720 1715800 now you need to tell me<br />what your plan is to save the world.
1716680 1720200 We're not meant to save the world.<br />We're meant to leave it.
1725880 1726880 Rangers.
1727000 1730840 The last components of<br />our one versatile ship in orbit
1730920 1731920 the Endurance.
1732000 1733640 Our final expedition.
1734400 1737720 You sent people out there<br />looking for a new home?
1737800 1739080 The Lazarus missions.
1739400 1740440 Oh, that sounds cheerful.
1740760 1742280 Lazarus came back from the dead.
1742640 1744920 Sure, but he had to die<br />in the first place.
1745000 1746800 There's not a planet<br />in our solar system
1746880 1747960 that could sustain life
1748040 1750320 and the nearest star's<br />over a thousand years away.
1750400 1752600 I mean, that doesn't<br />even qualify as futile.
1754720 1755800 Where'd you send them?
1756240 1757240 Cooper
1757760 1762000 I can't tell you anymore<br />unless you agree to pilot this craft.
1762520 1763920 You're the best pilot we ever had.
1764000 1765680 Yeah, and I barely<br />left the stratosphere.
1765920 1767960 This team never left the simulator.
1768240 1769240 We need a pilot
1769320 1771800 and this is the mission<br />that you were trained for.
1772280 1773520 Without even knowing it?
1774560 1778400 An hour ago, you didn't even know<br />I was alive. You were going anyway.
1778800 1780040 We had no choice.
1780840 1782320 But something sent you here.
1782600 1783680 They chose you.
1784000 1785080 Who's "they"?
1792880 1795160 How long would I be gone?
1795240 1796360 Hard to know.
1797000 1798000 Years?
1798720 1800160 I've got kids, Professor.
1801000 1803200 Get out there and save them.
1806200 1807200 Who's "they"?
1807520 1811440 We started detecting gravitational<br />anomalies almost 50 years ago.
1811520 1812720 Mostly small distortions
1812800 1814600 to our instruments<br />in the upper atmosphere.
1814920 1818000 In fact, I believe<br />you encountered one yourself.
1818720 1820360 Yeah, over the Straights.
1821600 1824440 My crash. Something tripped<br />my fly-by-wire.
1824520 1825560 Exactly.
1826720 1831200 But of all these anomalies,<br />the most significant is this:
1831480 1832920 Out near Saturn
1833600 1835320 a disturbance of space-time.
1837560 1838560 Is that a wormhole?
1838800 1840560 It appeared 48 years ago.
1840880 1843080 And it leads where?
1843320 1844680 Another galaxy.
1846600 1848840 A wormhole's not<br />a naturally occurring phenomenon.
1848920 1850200 Someone placed it there.
1851000 1852000 "They"?
1852880 1856600 And whoever they are,<br />they appear to be looking out for us.
1857280 1860160 That wormhole lets us<br />travel to other stars.
1860240 1861680 It came along right as we needed it.
1861840 1864880 They've put potentially habitable<br />worlds right within our reach.
1864960 1867160 12, in fact,<br />from our initial probes.
1867240 1868560 You sent probes into that?
1869360 1872520 We sent people into it.<br />Ten years ago.
1873480 1874920 The Lazarus missions.
1875440 1876640 12 possible worlds
1876720 1879360 12 Ranger launches carrying
1879440 1881720 the bravest humans ever to live
1881920 1884560 led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.
1884720 1887920 Each person's landing pod had<br />enough life support for two years.
1888000 1889776 But they could use hibernation<br />to stretch that
1889800 1893000 making observations on organics<br />over a decade or more.
1893200 1895280 Their mission was<br />to assess their world
1895360 1896680 and if it showed potential
1897280 1900000 then they could send out a signal,<br />bed down for the long nap
1900360 1901360 wait to be rescued.
1901680 1903480 And what if the world<br />didn't show promise?
1904440 1905520 Hence the bravery.
1906360 1908720 You don't have the resources<br />to visit all 12.
1909000 1910000 No.
1911040 1913600 Data transmission back through<br />the wormhole is rudimentary.
1913680 1916520 Simple binary pings<br />on an annual basis give us some clue
1916600 1918520 as to which worlds have potential.
1919040 1920520 And one system shows promise.
1920720 1923000 Yeah, one. That's a bit<br />of a long shot, isn't it?
1923960 1926480 One system<br />with three potential worlds?
1927120 1928240 No long shot.
1930720 1931720 Okay.
1932520 1934200 So if we find a home...
1937360 1938360 then what?
1938520 1940320 That's the long shot.
1940880 1943640 There's a Plan A and a Plan B.
1944680 1947400 Did you notice anything strange<br />about the launch chamber?
1958560 1961200 This entire facility's a centrifuge.
1961640 1964200 Some kind of vehicle.<br />A space station?
1964280 1966000 Both. Plan A.
1966200 1967720 How do you get it off the ground?
1968360 1972080 The first gravitational anomalies<br />changed everything.
1972160 1976200 Suddenly we knew<br />that harnessing gravity was real.
1976640 1981120 So I started working on a theory<br />and we started building this station.
1981600 1983320 But you haven't solved it yet.
1984560 1986000 That's why there's Plan B.
1986720 1988160 The problem is gravity.
1988240 1991400 How to get a viable amount<br />of human life off the planet.
1991480 1992480 This is one way.
1992760 1994760 Plan B: a population bomb.
1995480 1999680 Over 5,000 fertilized eggs<br />weighing in at just under 900 kilos.
2000920 2001920 How would you raise them?
2002200 2004760 With equipment on board,<br />we incubate the first ten.
2004840 2008320 After that, with surrogacy,<br />the growth becomes exponential.
2009320 2012200 Within 30 years,<br />we could have a colony of hundreds.
2012640 2015840 The real difficulty with colonization<br />is genetic diversity.
2016360 2017520 This takes care of that.
2018160 2020080 Yeah, but what about<br />the people here? You just...
2020960 2022080 you give up on them?
2022640 2023640 My kids?
2024400 2027240 That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.
2029840 2031200 How far have you got?
2031440 2032520 Almost there.
2032640 2034680 You're asking me to hang everything
2036200 2037200 on an almost.
2037720 2039800 I'm asking you to trust me.
2043080 2044480 Find us a new home.
2045280 2046880 And by the time you return
2047720 2050040 I will have solved<br />the problem of gravity.
2051360 2052680 I give you my word.
2064840 2065880 Go away!
2076600 2077600 Murph.
2077840 2080480 Go! If you're leaving, just go.
2083520 2085880 This world was never enough<br />for you, was it, Coop?
2086960 2090360 What, because heading out there<br />is what I feel like I was born to do?
2091480 2092720 And it excites me?
2093960 2096160 No, that does not make it wrong.
2096440 2097440 It might.
2097920 2100560 Don't trust the right thing<br />done for the wrong reason.
2101640 2103920 The why of the thing,<br />that's the foundation.
2104000 2105760 And the foundation's solid.
2109040 2113560 We farmers, we sit here every year<br />when the rains fail and we say:
2114120 2115280 "Next year."
2115960 2119320 Well, next year ain't gonna save us,<br />nor the one after that.
2119880 2121400 This world's a treasure, Donald
2121480 2123920 but it's been telling us<br />to leave for a while now.
2128760 2132120 Mankind was born on Earth,<br />it was never meant to die here.
2135600 2138560 Tom will be all right, but you got<br />to make things right with Murph.
2138640 2139680 I will.
2140680 2143320 Without making promises<br />you don't know you can keep.
2153800 2155520 You have to talk to me, Murph.
2158120 2160120 I need to fix this before I go.
2160320 2162560 Then I'll keep it broken<br />so you have to stay.
2164600 2166280 After you kids came along
2166360 2169520 your mom, she said something to me<br />I never quite understood.
2169800 2171080 She said, "Now...
2173080 2177200 we're just here<br />to be memories for our kids."
2182480 2184520 And I think that<br />now I understand what she meant.
2188320 2191760 Once you're a parent, you're<br />the ghost of your children's future.
2193640 2195240 You said ghosts didn't exist.
2201800 2203040 That's right, Murph.
2206360 2207360 Murph, look at me.
2210520 2212680 I can't be your ghost right now.
2214680 2216200 I need to exist.
2218160 2219720 They chose me.
2220760 2224200 Murph, they chose me. You saw.<br />You're the one who led me to them.
2227000 2229040 That's exactly why you can't go.
2232600 2233920 I figured out the message.
2234840 2236960 One word. Know what it is?
2237480 2239200 - Murph.<br />- "Stay."
2239680 2241720 It says, "Stay," Dad.
2241800 2242800 Murph.
2243280 2244680 You don't believe me.
2244840 2247600 Look at the books! Look at this.<br />It says, "Stay."
2247680 2250800 Why... You're not listening!<br />It says, "Stay!"
2251000 2252400 No, I'm coming back.
2252920 2253920 When?
2266680 2269000 One for you, one for me.
2269360 2272200 When I'm up there<br />in hypersleep, or...
2272800 2275680 or traveling<br />near the speed of light, or...
2276120 2277720 near a black hole...
2278560 2280400 time's gonna change for me.
2281080 2282880 And it's gonna run more slowly.
2283120 2284160 Now
2284600 2286000 when we get back...
2287600 2288800 we're gonna compare.
2288880 2291200 - Time will run differently for us?<br />- Yeah.
2292320 2296800 By the time I get back, we might<br />even be the same age, you and me.
2297320 2298320 "What?"
2298600 2299680 Imagine that!
2303800 2304960 Aw, Murph...
2305040 2307320 You have no idea<br />when you're coming back.
2309280 2310560 No idea at all!
2313800 2316000 Murph, don't...<br />Don't make me leave like this.
2316080 2317200 Come on, Murph!
2317920 2319800 Don't make me leave like this, Murph!
2327680 2328680 Hey...
2329080 2330120 I love you.
2330600 2332160 Forever. You hear me?
2332800 2335720 I love you forever,<br />and I'm coming back.
2341440 2342640 I'm coming back.
2360400 2361400 How'd it go?
2361720 2362720 It went fine.
2362800 2363840 Just fine.
2370960 2371960 I love you, Tom.
2372560 2373920 - Travel safe, huh?<br />- Yeah.
2374080 2375920 You look after our place<br />for me, all right?
2376600 2377600 All right?
2382800 2384416 Hey, can I use your truck<br />while you're gone?
2384440 2385680 You mean your truck?
2387360 2388800 I'll make sure they bring it back.
2391120 2392400 Look after my kids, Donald!
2404680 2408320 Go for main engine start.<br />T-minus 10...
2409080 2410800 - Dad!<br />- Nine...
2410880 2411880 Dad!
2412880 2413880 Eight...
2415240 2416240 seven...
2416320 2417320 Dad!
2417800 2418800 Six...
2420160 2422960 five, main engine start, four...
2424200 2425200 three...
2426000 2427000 two...
2428000 2429880 one. Booster ignition and...
2438640 2441120 All engines look good.<br />Beginning roll program.
2445280 2447760 Prepare for stage one separation.
2448240 2449280 Stage one.
2454920 2456480 There is Mach One.
2457640 2460920 Everybody good?<br />Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?
2463160 2466000 They gave him a humor setting<br />so he'd fit in better with his unit.
2466800 2468160 He thinks it relaxes us.
2468240 2470720 A giant sarcastic robot.
2472040 2473200 What a great idea!
2473360 2475880 I have a cue light I can use<br />when I'm joking if you like.
2475960 2477000 That'd probably help.
2477080 2478936 Yeah, you can use it<br />to find your way back to the ship
2478960 2480360 after I blow you out the airlock.
2481960 2483520 What's your humor setting, TARS?
2483600 2484920 That's 100%.
2485000 2486800 Let's bring it on down to 75, please.
2487120 2488960 Stage two separation.
2499120 2500800 All feeds going manual.
2501440 2502560 Going manual.
2505000 2507320 Deactivate probe heater one,<br />two and three.
2507400 2508440 Check.
2513640 2514800 Taking control.
2514880 2516400 This is handover to you.
2520240 2522040 - A.D.F. check.<br />- Over.
2522760 2526280 Pull thrusters back.<br />Fuel cells one, two, three.
2526360 2527480 100%.
2527760 2529320 Ex-mites.
2538160 2539880 It's hard leaving everything.
2540160 2542840 My kids. Your father.
2543440 2545520 We're gonna be spending<br />a lot of time together.
2545640 2547080 We should learn to talk.
2547680 2548680 And when not to.
2550680 2552120 Just being honest.
2552360 2554360 I don't think<br />you need to be that honest.
2554920 2557320 Hey, TARS,<br />what's your honesty parameter?
2557400 2558640 90%.
2558920 2559960 90%?
2560040 2562680 Absolute honesty isn't always<br />the most diplomatic
2562760 2565920 nor the safest form of communication<br />with emotional beings.
2566000 2567040 Okay.
2567600 2570000 90% it is, Dr. Brand.
2573800 2576680 We are coming up on the Endurance.<br />12 minutes out.
2593320 2594920 Okay. Taking control.
2598600 2601120 Approaching module port, 500m.
2614000 2615000 It's all you, Doyle.
2632560 2635200 Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.
2640080 2641080 I feel good.
2641480 2642480 Take us home.
2650120 2651760 - Lock.<br />- Target locked.
2651840 2653000 - Target locked.<br />- Well done.
2653080 2654120 Okay, helmets on.
2654200 2655200 Good job.
2687480 2688640 Door's not charging.
2689040 2690200 Never mind.
2712520 2713880 Cooper, you should have control.
2714440 2715680 Control here.
2717160 2719520 <i>Communication with<br />ring module active.</i>
2726120 2727240 Oh, wow.
2733040 2734120 That's initiate.
2741280 2742400 <i>Are we ready to spin?</i>
2742480 2743560 Just a sec.
2754600 2755720 Hello, CASE.
2755800 2756840 Hello, TARS.
2757840 2759320 All right, we're all set.
2760240 2761240 All right, let's do it.
2789640 2790880 30% of spin.
2797360 2798480 <i>One G.</i>
2799440 2801360 <i>How's gravity treating you<br />back there?</i>
2801720 2802720 Well.
2805920 2807600 Romilly? Hey, you okay?
2807680 2808760 - Yeah.<br />- You all right?
2809280 2810480 Yeah, I just need a minute.
2811360 2813520 Okay, I think we have<br />some Dramamine in the hab pod
2813600 2814600 I'm just gonna get that
2814680 2816256 or maybe in the cryo-beds.<br />I'll just be a sec.
2816280 2817880 - Hey, Brand?<br />- Yeah?
2818440 2819440 Bring a lot.
2828400 2830800 <i>Amelia, be safe.</i>
2831360 2833280 <i>Give my regards to Dr. Mann.</i>
2833800 2834800 I will, Dad.
2834880 2839800 <i>It looks good for your trajectory.<br />We've calculated two years to Saturn.</i>
2840600 2841880 That's a lot of Dramamine.
2842960 2844840 Look after my family,<br />will you, please, sir?
2845640 2848120 <i>We'll be waiting for you<br />when you get back.</i>
2848840 2852640 <i>A little older, a little wiser,<br />but happy to see you.</i>
2855280 2858000 <i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>
2858920 2862800 <i>Old age should burn<br />and rave at close of day</i>
2864040 2868520 <i>Rage, rage against<br />the dying of the light</i>
2869880 2873320 <i>Though wise men at their end<br />know dark is right</i>
2873560 2876440 <i>Because their words had forked<br />no lightning they</i>
2876800 2880120 <i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>
2880880 2885000 <i>Rage, rage against<br />the dying of the light</i>
2901000 2902400 - You good?<br />- Yeah.
2903560 2904880 Okay, thank you, sir.
2908240 2909360 Here. Pills.
2912160 2913320 So alone.
2914000 2915960 We have each other.<br />Dr. Mann had it worse.
2916080 2917320 No, I mean them.
2918600 2921880 It's a perfect planet, and we are not<br />gonna find another one like her.
2922400 2926120 No, it's not like<br />looking for a new condo.
2926600 2928520 The human race is going to be...
2929000 2930040 adrift...
2930360 2933680 desperate for a rock it can cling to<br />while it catches its breath.
2934200 2935520 We need to find that rock.
2936400 2937800 And our three prospects
2937880 2940680 are at the edge of<br />what might sustain human life.
2941360 2943520 Laura Miller's planet is first.
2943840 2945400 Laura started our biology program.
2950880 2952400 Wolf Edmunds is here.
2952480 2953640 Tell me about Edmunds.
2955600 2957040 Wolf's a particle physicist.
2959560 2961400 None of them had families, huh?
2962640 2965320 No. No attachments.<br />My father insisted.
2965720 2969040 They all knew the odds against ever<br />seeing another human being again.
2969200 2971136 I'm hoping we can surprise<br />at least three of them.
2971160 2973040 - How about Mann?<br />- Dr. Mann?
2973120 2975040 He's remarkable. He's the best of us.
2975200 2977320 He inspired 11 people to follow him
2977400 2979480 on the loneliest journey<br />in human history.
2979560 2981160 Scientists, explorers.
2981240 2982480 That's what I love.
2983080 2985320 You know, out there<br />we face great odds.
2985560 2986800 Death, but...
2988640 2989640 not evil.
2990160 2991920 What, you don't think<br />nature can be evil?
2992240 2994680 No. Formidable. Frightening. But...
2995600 2996800 no, not evil.
2998720 3001760 Is a lion evil<br />because it rips a gazelle to shreds?
3002240 3003880 Just what we take with us, then.
3004680 3005720 Yeah.
3006240 3008160 This crew represents<br />the best of humanity.
3008320 3009400 Even me, huh?
3009560 3011640 You know what? We agreed, 90%.
3011720 3012800 There you go.
3013240 3015000 - Don't stay up.<br />- I'll be there in a minute.
3015880 3019000 Just remember, Coop, you are<br />literally wasting your breath.
3025840 3028600 Hey, TARS? Let's go over<br />that trajectory one more time.
3029240 3030680 Eight months to Mars.
3031320 3034160 Counter-orbital slingshot around.<br />Fourteen months to Saturn.
3034240 3035400 Nothing's changed on that.
3035480 3036760 Just let me ask you something.
3039800 3040840 Dr. Brand and Edmunds...
3040920 3042720 Why are you whispering?<br />They can't hear you.
3044520 3047520 Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?
3047840 3048920 I wouldn't know.
3049000 3051800 Is that 90% "wouldn't know"<br />or 10% "wouldn't know"?
3051880 3053880 I also have<br />a discretion setting, Cooper.
3056520 3058120 But not a poker face, Slick.
3070360 3071400 Hey, guys.
3072360 3074760 Dad's about to go down<br />for the long nap.
3075280 3077720 So I wanted to give you an update.
3079640 3081760 <i>The Earth looks amazing from here.</i>
3083680 3085400 <i>You can't see any of the dust.</i>
3087720 3090120 <i>I really hope<br />you guys are doing great.</i>
3090800 3092056 <i>I know you're gonna get this message.</i>
3092080 3094880 <i>Professor Brand's assured me<br />that he's gonna get it to you, and...</i>
3095480 3096920 <i>know that I love you.</i>
3098800 3100920 - Is it him?<br />- I don't think so, Murph.
3107840 3109080 You must be Donald.
3111240 3112280 Hello, Murph.
3113280 3114880 Why are you in my dad's truck?
3115600 3117480 He wanted me<br />to bring it for your brother.
3118400 3120360 He sent you a message.
3123600 3125480 She's pretty upset<br />with him for leaving.
3125560 3129200 If you record any messages, I can<br />get them to transmit it to Cooper.
3130520 3132800 Murph is a bright spark.
3134080 3136520 Maybe I should fan the flame.
3136800 3138800 She's already making fools<br />of her teachers.
3139360 3141640 So maybe she should come<br />and make a fool out of you.
3143000 3144120 So where are they?
3144400 3145680 Heading for Mars.
3146480 3150320 The next time you hear from Cooper,<br />they'll be coming up on Saturn.
3188640 3190416 <i>As far as school goes,<br />the administration wants me</i>
3190440 3192000 <i>to repeat Plant Pathology.</i>
3192360 3193360 <i>Which sucks.</i>
3193920 3197120 <i>But they said I could start<br />Advanced Agriculture a year early.</i>
3198800 3202240 <i>All right, I got to go, Dad.<br />Hope you're safe up there.</i>
3206760 3208000 <i>Sorry, Coop.</i>
3208080 3212480 <i>I asked Murph to say hi,<br />but she's as stubborn as her old man.</i>
3213120 3214520 <i>I'll try again next time.</i>
3229320 3230480 You all right, Rom?
3233200 3234640 This gets to me, Cooper.
3234720 3236200 This...
3237000 3239680 Millimeters of aluminum,<br />that's it, and then nothing...
3239960 3243520 out there for millions of miles<br />won't kill us in seconds.
3244880 3248840 You know that some of the finest<br />solo yachtsmen in the world
3248920 3250000 don't know how to swim?
3250920 3253640 They don't know how. And<br />if they go overboard, they're done.
3255600 3257240 We're explorers, Rom.
3259040 3260240 This is our boat.
3260840 3261880 Here.
3287880 3291640 This is from the relay probe?<br />It was in orbit around the wormhole.
3292160 3294800 This is the wormhole,<br />and every time we'd come around
3295360 3298520 we would receive images from<br />the other side of the foreign galaxy.
3298640 3300600 Oh, yeah. Like swinging<br />a periscope around.
3300840 3301920 Exactly.
3302000 3303800 So we got a pretty good idea
3303880 3305800 what we're gonna find<br />on the other side, huh?
3307280 3308360 Navigationally.
3309920 3313200 <i>Guys? Looks like we'll be approaching<br />the wormhole in about three hours.</i>
3319720 3320720 Hey, Coop?
3321520 3322880 Can we stop the spinning?
3323360 3324360 Why?
3324600 3326640 Because we're close<br />enough to see it now?
3328720 3329760 All right.
3329960 3331000 Thanks.
3336400 3338520 There, that's it!<br />That's the wormhole!
3338600 3340200 Say it, don't spray it, Rom.
3340680 3341720 It's a sphere.
3341920 3345280 Of course it is. What, you...<br />You thought it would just be a hole?
3346760 3350120 No, it's just that all the<br />illustrations I've ever seen, they...
3350200 3352840 In the illustrations, they're trying<br />to show you how it works.
3353960 3357800 So they say you wanna go<br />from here to there.
3358120 3359360 But it's too far, right?
3360520 3364880 So a wormhole bends space like this,<br />so you can take a shortcut through
3365480 3366560 a higher dimension.
3367000 3368320 Okay, so
3369120 3371600 to show that, they've turned<br />three-dimensional space
3371680 3372680 into two dimensions
3372760 3376200 which turns a wormhole<br />into two dimensions, a circle.
3376680 3378680 What's a circle in three dimensions?
3380120 3381640 - A sphere.<br />- Exactly.
3381880 3383120 A spherical hole.
3383840 3386600 But who put it there?<br />Who do we have to thank?
3386960 3391000 I'm not thanking anybody until<br />we get out of here in one piece, Rom.
3398080 3399400 Any trick to this, Doyle?
3401120 3402200 No one knows.
3409600 3411000 The others made it, right?
3413320 3414520 At least some of them.
3445320 3448280 Everybody ready to say goodbye<br />to our solar system?
3449160 3450760 To our galaxy.
3452960 3454000 Here we go.
3485080 3486600 The controls won't work here.
3487040 3488320 We're passing through the bulk.
3488600 3490520 It's space beyond<br />our three dimensions.
3491120 3492920 All you can do is record and observe.
3503840 3504840 What is that?
3507240 3508520 I think it's them.
3509000 3510680 Distorting space-time.
3513000 3514000 Don't...!
3540680 3541680 What was that?
3544760 3546000 The first handshake.
3547800 3548800 We're...
3550400 3551440 We're here.
3571320 3573360 So the lost communications<br />came through.
3573440 3574440 How?
3574520 3576360 The relay on this side cached them.
3576440 3579520 So years of basic data.<br />No real surprises.
3580640 3583720 Miller's site has kept pinging<br />thumbs up, as has Dr. Mann's.
3584240 3586120 Edmunds' went down three years ago.
3586880 3588040 Transmitter failure?
3588120 3590880 Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up<br />right until it went dark.
3590960 3592800 But Miller's still looks<br />good though, right?
3593320 3594720 Because she's coming up fast.
3595520 3597120 With one complication.
3597840 3600680 The planet is much closer<br />to Gargantua than we thought.
3600920 3601960 Gargantua?
3602040 3603560 It's what we're calling<br />the black hole.
3603600 3605680 Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets<br />both orbit it.
3605760 3607720 And Miller's is on the horizon?
3607800 3609200 As a basketball around a hoop.
3609520 3611200 Landing there takes us<br />dangerously close.
3611280 3614440 And a black hole that big<br />has a huge gravitational pull.
3617160 3619160 Look, I could swing<br />around that neutron star
3619240 3620680 - to decelerate.<br />- No, it's not that.
3620720 3622720 It's time. The gravity on that planet
3622800 3626160 will slow our clock<br />compared to Earth's drastically.
3626920 3627920 How bad?
3628000 3631320 Every hour we spend<br />on that planet will be...
3632320 3634480 seven years back on Earth.
3635360 3636400 Jesus.
3636640 3638280 Well, that's relativity, folks.
3639720 3642200 Well, we can't just drop<br />down there without...
3642280 3644080 Cooper, we have a mission.
3644160 3645360 Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission
3645440 3647640 and our mission Plan A is<br />to find a planet
3647720 3650136 that can habitate the people that<br />are living on the Earth right now.
3650160 3651336 You can't just think<br />about your family.
3651360 3652736 Now you have to think<br />bigger than that, all right?
3652760 3655800 I am thinking about my family<br />and millions of other families, okay?
3655880 3657440 Plan A does not work
3657520 3660080 if the people on Earth are dead<br />by the time we pull it off.
3661280 3662680 No. It doesn't.
3663440 3664800 That's why there's a Plan B.
3666680 3668400 Okay. Cooper's right.
3668480 3669856 We need to think about time<br />as a resource
3669880 3670920 just like oxygen and food.
3670960 3672280 Going down there's gonna cost us.
3674280 3675320 All right, look.
3676800 3678600 Doctor Mann's data<br />is promising, right?
3678680 3680480 But it's going to take us months<br />to get there.
3680520 3682200 And Edmunds', it's even further.
3682280 3685041 Now, Miller hasn't sent much, but<br />what she has said is very promising.
3685080 3686520 It's water, it's organics...
3686600 3687776 You don't find that every day.
3687800 3690200 No, you don't. And just think<br />about the resources
3690280 3693200 including time that would be spent<br />trying to get back here.
3694960 3696120 - Romilly.<br />- Yeah.
3696200 3698680 How far off from Miller's planet<br />do we have to be
3698760 3700200 to stay out of the time shift?
3700560 3702000 Just back from the cusp.
3702320 3705120 All right, which is here,<br />just outside of Miller's planet.
3705200 3706720 - Right.<br />- Okay.
3707720 3710520 Here's Gargantua.<br />Here's Miller's planet.
3710960 3713720 Instead of taking the Endurance<br />into orbit around Miller's planet
3713800 3716400 which would conserve fuel,<br />but we would lose a lot of time
3716680 3719760 what if we... we take<br />a wider orbit around Gargantua
3719840 3723120 parallel with Miller's planet<br />outside of this time shift, to here?
3723520 3726200 Then we take the Ranger down,<br />we get Miller, we get her samples.
3726280 3728800 We come back, we analyze, we debrief.<br />We're in, we're out.
3728880 3731360 We lose a little fuel,<br />but we save a whole lot of time.
3731440 3733040 - That'll work.<br />- That's good.
3733120 3734576 There's not gonna be time<br />for monkey business
3734600 3735640 or chit-chat down there.
3735720 3738320 So, TARS, you should<br />definitely stay here.
3738400 3740840 CASE, you're with me.<br />Anyone else can stay.
3740920 3743400 If we're talking about a couple years
3743480 3745080 I could use the time<br />to research gravity.
3745120 3747720 Observations from the wormhole,<br />that's gold to Professor Brand.
3747800 3749480 TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.
3749560 3751840 Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting
3751920 3753960 but make sure we stay<br />in range of Miller's planet.
3754040 3756200 - You got it?<br />- I wouldn't leave you behind
3756880 3757920 Dr. Brand.
3762160 3763560 - You ready, CASE?<br />- Yup.
3764640 3765920 You don't say much, do you?
3766120 3767880 TARS talks plenty for both of us.
3769160 3770160 Detach.
3777280 3779000 Romilly, are you reading<br />these forces?
3779080 3780120 <i>Unbelievable.</i>
3783160 3784880 A literal heart of darkness.
3789080 3791720 If we could just see<br />the collapsed star inside
3791800 3794560 the singularity,<br />yeah, we'd solve gravity.
3794960 3796560 And we can't get anything from it?
3796640 3798120 <i>Nothing escapes that horizon.</i>
3798240 3799320 Not even light.
3799520 3802000 <i>The answer's there,<br />just no way to see it.</i>
3802080 3803080 There's Miller's planet.
3805760 3806880 Goodbye, Ranger.
3819320 3821200 This is fast for atmospheric entry.
3821680 3823120 Should we use the thrusters to slow?
3823160 3824160 No.
3824440 3827280 I'm gonna use the Ranger's<br />aerodynamics to save some fuel.
3827560 3828560 Air brake?
3828760 3830160 We want to get down fast, don't we?
3830360 3832080 Actually, we want<br />to get there in one piece.
3832600 3835200 - Hang on.<br />- Brand, Doyle, get ready.
3851040 3853056 - We should ease!<br />- Hands where I can see them, CASE.
3853080 3854240 The only time I went down was
3854320 3856280 when a machine was easing<br />at the wrong time.
3856480 3858256 - A little caution would go...<br />- Can get you killed
3858280 3859360 just like reckless drivin'.
3859440 3860520 Cooper, it's too damn fast!
3860600 3861600 I got this.
3866360 3867560 Should I disable the feedback?
3867600 3869920 No. I need to feel the air.
3874120 3875120 Here we go.
3878040 3879040 It's just water!
3880560 3881800 The stuff of life.
3882520 3883520 1,200m.
3884120 3885256 Do we have a fix on the beacon?
3885280 3886720 Got it! Can you maneuver?
3886800 3888200 I'll need to shave some speed.
3889040 3891400 I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.<br />Everybody hang on!
3893680 3894680 700.
3896760 3898720 On my cue, CASE. On my cue.
3902000 3903200 500m.
3912440 3913440 Fire!
3926520 3927600 Very graceful.
3927680 3928680 No.
3929360 3932200 But very efficient.
3933800 3935720 What are you waiting for? Let's go!
3935960 3937680 Go...!
3938000 3940880 Seven years per hour here.<br />Let's make it count!
3966320 3967320 This way.
3970240 3971560 About 200m.
3981080 3982520 The gravity's punishing.
3983640 3985480 Been floating through space too long?
3985760 3987680 130% Earth gravity.
3988160 3990800 Come on...
3992600 3993640 There's nothing here.
3993720 3995000 Should be right here.
3997040 3999720 If the signal's coming<br />from here, then...
4009120 4010200 Her beacon.
4018160 4019160 Wreckage.
4019920 4020920 <i>Where's the rest?</i>
4021440 4022600 Towards the mountains!
4026480 4028040 Those aren't mountains.
4029920 4031000 They're waves.
4036280 4038920 Oh, shit...
4039360 4041200 <i>All right, that one's<br />movin' away from us.</i>
4047480 4048680 We need the recorder.
4058840 4060960 Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!
4061040 4064360 We're not leaving without her data.
4064560 4065680 Get back here now!
4066040 4067320 We do not have time!
4067520 4068960 The second wave is coming!
4069120 4070360 We're in the middle of a swell.
4071280 4072320 No, I got it.
4072800 4074800 Get your ass back to the Ranger now!
4079560 4081600 Brand, get back here now!
4083400 4085600 No, Cooper, go... I can't make it.
4085880 4087880 - Go!<br />- CASE, go get her.
4092880 4094720 - Go!<br />- Get up. Get up, Brand!
4095560 4096720 Go...!
4098560 4099560 I'm not gonna make it!
4099640 4101360 Yes, you are...!
4108040 4110600 Come on, CASE has her...!<br />Get back here, Doyle!
4112920 4113920 Come on!
4116560 4117600 Get to the hatch!
4122280 4123400 Go...!
4129080 4130080 Shit.
4130520 4132360 Manually overriding inside hatch!
4135640 4136880 Cooper! Wait!
4139440 4140440 Cooper!
4143920 4145320 The engines are flooded!
4145520 4147120 I'm gonna have to shut her down.
4179600 4180600 Holy shit.
4185080 4186080 Hang on!
4216240 4217480 CASE, what's the problem?
4217560 4219520 Too waterlogged. Let it drain.
4221000 4222160 Goddamn it!
4222240 4224520 - I told you to leave me!<br />- And I told you
4224600 4226520 - Why didn't you?<br />- To get your ass back here!
4226880 4229056 The difference is, one of us<br />was thinking about the mission
4229080 4230136 - Brand!<br />- Cooper, you were thinking about
4230160 4231200 getting home!
4233200 4235120 I was trying to do the right thing!
4235520 4237200 Can you tell that to Doyle?
4239480 4240600 CASE, how much time?
4240680 4241840 45 to an hour.
4243600 4244680 The stuff of life, huh?
4245600 4246960 What's this gonna cost us, Brand?
4247840 4249840 A lot. Decades.
4256960 4258040 What happened to Miller?
4258720 4260800 Judging by the wreckage
4260880 4263800 she was broken up<br />by a wave soon after impact.
4264440 4266880 How's the wreckage stayed together<br />after all these years, huh?
4268120 4269640 Because of the time slippage.
4271080 4274880 On this planet's time,<br />she just landed hours ago.
4276200 4278120 She probably just died minutes ago.
4278680 4282320 The data Doyle received was just<br />the initial status echoing endlessly.
4282880 4284680 Oh, we are not prepared for this.
4287280 4290600 You eggheads have the survival skills<br />of a Boy Scout troop.
4290880 4293920 Well, we got this far on our brains.<br />Farther than any human in history.
4294000 4295320 Well, not far enough!
4296120 4297360 And now we're stuck here
4297440 4299360 till there won't be<br />anyone left on Earth to save.
4302160 4304680 I'm counting every minute,<br />same as you, Cooper.
4309520 4312360 Is there any possibility,<br />I don't know, some...
4312440 4314920 some kind of a way we can<br />maybe all jump in... in a black hole?
4315000 4316200 Gain back the years?
4317360 4318600 Don't shake your head at me.
4318880 4320720 Time is relative, okay?
4320800 4323520 It can stretch<br />and it can squeeze, but
4324280 4326400 it can't run backwards.<br />It just can't.
4326480 4329680 No, the only thing that can<br />move across dimensions, like time
4329760 4330760 is gravity.
4333360 4334400 Okay.
4336240 4338240 The beings that led us here
4338720 4341400 they communicate<br />through gravity, right?
4341480 4342520 Yes.
4342600 4344320 Could they be talking to us<br />from the future?
4345040 4347280 - Maybe.<br />- Okay. If they can...
4348360 4351520 "They" are beings of five dimensions.
4351880 4355200 All right? To them, time might be<br />another physical dimension.
4355400 4356400 To them...
4357080 4361000 the past might be a canyon that<br />they can climb into and the future
4361080 4364240 a mountain they can climb up.<br />But to us, it's not, okay?
4365200 4366680 Look, Cooper, I screwed up.
4367080 4368120 I'm sorry.
4369760 4371280 But you knew about relativity.
4374440 4375480 Brand...
4380160 4381680 My daughter was ten years old.
4382640 4385120 I couldn't teach her<br />Einstein's theories before I left.
4385960 4388320 Couldn't you have told her<br />you were going to save the world?
4389000 4390000 No.
4391520 4395200 When you become a parent,<br />one thing becomes really clear.
4397120 4399720 And that is that you want<br />to make sure your children feel safe.
4401040 4402920 And it rules out<br />telling a ten-year-old
4403000 4404520 that the world is ending.
4406880 4407880 Cooper?
4411960 4414200 - How long for the engines, CASE?<br />- A minute or two.
4414280 4416560 We don't have it. Helmets on!
4420320 4422000 Brand, co-pilot, you're up.
4422080 4424840 CASE, blow the cabin oxygen<br />through the main thrusters!
4424920 4426360 - We're gonna spark it.<br />- Roger that.
4426680 4427960 - Locked.<br />- Depressurizing.
4433560 4434640 Engines up!
4462440 4463480 Hello, Rom.
4464400 4465760 I've waited years.
4467000 4468560 How... How many years?
4470520 4471600 By now it must be...
4471680 4473360 It's 23 years
4473520 4475120 four months, eight days.
4479400 4480400 Doyle?
4486480 4489400 I thought I was prepared.<br />I knew the theory.
4490800 4492120 Reality's different.
4493120 4494120 And Miller?
4495760 4497080 There's nothing here for us.
4500480 4501760 Why didn't you sleep?
4502640 4504520 Oh, I had a couple of stretches.
4505160 4507080 But I stopped believing<br />you were coming back.
4507160 4509680 And something seemed wrong<br />about dreaming my life away.
4510480 4513120 I learned what I could<br />from the black hole
4513880 4515880 but I couldn't send anything<br />to your father.
4516280 4518320 We've been receiving,<br />but nothing gets out.
4518680 4519680 Is he alive?
4519760 4520760 Oh, yeah.
4521000 4522680 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah.
4525680 4528200 We've got years of messages stored.
4528800 4529800 Cooper.
4530160 4532760 <i>Messages span 23 years.</i>
4535080 4536400 Play it from the beginning.
4539440 4540480 <i>Hey, Dad.</i>
4541960 4544000 <i>Checking in. Saying hi.</i>
4546960 4548320 <i>Finished second in school.</i>
4550160 4552160 <i>Miss Kurling's still<br />giving me C's though.</i>
4552720 4555040 <i>Pulled me down,<br />but, you know, second's not bad.</i>
4556520 4558320 <i>Grandpa attended the ceremony.</i>
4561280 4562280 <i>Oh.</i>
4563080 4564560 <i>I met another girl, Dad.</i>
4565000 4566120 <i>I...</i>
4567400 4569040 <i>I really think this is the one.</i>
4570400 4571440 <i>Name's Lois.</i>
4571520 4572800 <i>That's her right there.</i>
4575840 4577400 <i>Murphy stole Grandpa's car.</i>
4578480 4580760 <i>She crashed it. She's okay, though.</i>
4581600 4582600 <i>Hey, Dad.</i>
4583600 4584800 <i>Look at this.</i>
4585640 4586800 <i>You're a grandpa.</i>
4588440 4589760 <i>His name's Jesse.</i>
4590680 4595360 <i>I kind of wanted to call him Coop,<br />but Lois says maybe next time.</i>
4595840 4597720 <i>Donald says he's already earned<br />the "great" part</i>
4597800 4599680 <i>so we just leave it at that.</i>
4602960 4605080 <i>Oh, dear...</i>
4605680 4607080 <i>Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."</i>
4607520 4609560 <i>Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.</i>
4609640 4611000 <i>Sorry it's been a while.</i>
4613320 4614360 <i>Just...</i>
4616520 4618000 <i>what with Jesse and all.</i>
4624560 4626400 <i>Grandpa died last week.</i>
4627280 4630000 <i>We buried him out in the back forty<br />next to Mom and...</i>
4631000 4632000 <i>Jesse.</i>
4632920 4635720 <i>Which is where we would<br />have buried you if you'd ever...</i>
4636760 4637800 <i>come back.</i>
4639400 4641240 <i>Murph was there at the funeral.</i>
4642320 4644760 <i>We don't see her that much,<br />but she came for that.</i>
4647920 4650040 <i>You aren't listening to this,<br />I know that.</i>
4653160 4655640 <i>All these messages are just, like...</i>
4656960 4660640 <i>drifting out there in the darkness.</i>
4661520 4663520 <i>Lois says that...</i>
4664600 4666880 <i>I have to let you go.</i>
4667560 4669000 <i>And...</i>
4669560 4670640 <i>so...</i>
4673960 4677000 <i>I guess I'm letting you go.</i>
4677880 4679720 <i>I don't know where you are, Dad...</i>
4680960 4683200 <i>but I hope that<br />you're at peace and...</i>
4685280 4686280 <i>Goodbye.</i>
4699320 4700400 <i>Hey, Dad.</i>
4703320 4704320 Hey, Murph.
4704440 4706000 <i>You son of a bitch.</i>
4710200 4712520 <i>I never made one of these<br />when you were still responding</i>
4712600 4714400 <i>'cause I was so mad<br />at you for leaving.</i>
4717640 4719480 <i>And then when you went quiet, it...</i>
4722200 4724600 <i>seemed like I should live<br />with that decision. And I have.</i>
4729320 4731200 <i>But today's my birthday.</i>
4735000 4737680 <i>And it's a special one,<br />because you told me...</i>
4742120 4745760 <i>You once told me that when you<br />came back, we might be the same age.</i>
4747880 4750400 <i>And today I'm the age<br />you were when you left.</i>
4753680 4756080 <i>So it would be a real good time<br />for you to come back.</i>
4769640 4771320 I didn't mean to intrude.
4771680 4774240 It's just that<br />I've never seen you in here before.
4774320 4776000 I've never been in here before.
4778120 4780880 I talk to Amelia all the time.
4781520 4782520 It helps.
4783440 4784720 I'm glad you've started.
4784800 4786160 - I...<br />- I haven't. I...
4786240 4788040 just had something<br />I needed to get out.
4788920 4790280 I know they're still out there.
4790360 4791360 I know.
4791440 4792480 There are so many reasons
4792560 4795480 their communications<br />might not be getting through.
4795880 4796920 I know, Professor.
4797600 4800920 I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.
4801520 4803520 Them never coming back or...
4804840 4808000 coming back to find we've failed.
4808080 4809400 Then let's succeed.
4810400 4811400 So...
4812040 4816160 back to the fourth iteration.<br />Let's run it through some new fields.
4816240 4819480 With respect, Professor,<br />we've tried that hundreds of times.
4819560 4823200 It only has to work once, Murph.
4826200 4829600 Every rivet that they strike<br />could have been a bullet.
4830000 4832000 We've done well for the world here
4832080 4836520 whether or not we crack the equation<br />before I kick the bucket.
4837000 4838560 Don't be morbid, Professor.
4838640 4840080 I'm not afraid of death.
4840400 4841920 I'm an old physicist.
4843560 4845000 I'm afraid of time.
4851960 4853040 Time.
4855200 4856600 You're afraid of time.
4859320 4860976 For years we've been trying<br />to solve the equation
4861000 4863600 without changing<br />the underlying assumption about time.
4863800 4865320 - And?<br />- And that means
4865400 4869120 each iteration is an attempt<br />to prove its own proof. It's...
4870000 4872120 recursive. It's nonsensical.
4872200 4876000 Are you calling my life's work<br />nonsense, Murph?
4876080 4877720 No, I'm saying that<br />you've been trying to
4877800 4881320 finish it with one arm, no,<br />with both arms tied behind your back.
4883760 4885400 And I don't understand why.
4886600 4888040 I'm an old man, Murph.
4889320 4891560 Can we take this point up<br />at another time?
4891960 4893680 I want to talk to my daughter.
4896040 4898240 <i>Stepping out into the universe</i>
4898560 4902800 <i>we must confront the reality<br />of interstellar travel.</i>
4903160 4907600 <i>We must reach<br />far beyond our own lifespans.</i>
4907680 4912640 <i>We must think not as individuals<br />but as a species.</i>
4915240 4918360 <i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>
4919920 4922400 TARS kept the Endurance<br />right where we needed her.
4922480 4925280 But the trip took years longer<br />than we anticipated.
4925520 4928560 We no longer have the fuel<br />to visit both prospects, so...
4929280 4930360 we have to choose.
4931720 4932760 But how?
4933760 4935160 They're both promising.
4936880 4941400 Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann<br />is the one still transmitting, so...
4941480 4944000 We've no reason to suspect<br />Edmunds's data would have soured.
4945360 4947600 His world has key elements<br />to sustain human life.
4947760 4949080 As does Dr. Mann's.
4949160 4950520 Cooper, this is my field.
4951880 4952960 And...
4954000 4955736 I really believe<br />Edmunds' is the better prospect.
4955760 4956760 Why?
4957080 4958760 Gargantua, that's why.
4960200 4963680 Look at Miller's planet.<br />Hydrocarbons, organics, yes
4964320 4966440 but no life. Sterile.
4967280 4968720 We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
4968840 4970200 Because of the black hole?
4970680 4973400 Murphy's Law.<br />Whatever can happen will happen.
4973760 4976120 Accident is the first building block<br />of evolution.
4976200 4979000 But when you're orbiting a black hole<br />not enough can happen.
4979080 4981560 It sucks in asteroids and comets
4981640 4983520 other events<br />which would otherwise reach you.
4983600 4984920 We need to go further afield.
4985880 4987880 You once said that Dr. Mann...
4989560 4990880 was the best of us.
4991160 4994200 He's remarkable.<br />We're only here because of him.
4994600 4996280 And yet here he is.
4996560 4997680 He's on the ground
4998080 5000600 and he's sending<br />a very unambiguous message
5000680 5002880 telling us to come to his planet.
5003200 5007840 Granted, but Edmunds' data<br />is more promising.
5008240 5009240 We should vote.
5009320 5011880 Well, if we're going to vote,<br />there's something you should know.
5012520 5013520 Brand?
5013920 5015200 He has a right to know.
5015920 5017400 That has nothing to do with it.
5017680 5018680 What does?
5018760 5020480 She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.
5020680 5021720 Is that true?
5022080 5023080 Yes.
5026120 5028400 And that makes me<br />want to follow my heart.
5032040 5035440 But maybe we've spent too long trying<br />to figure all this out with theory.
5035520 5037080 You're a scientist, Brand.
5037160 5038360 So listen to me...
5039400 5043640 when I say that love isn't<br />something we invented. It's...
5044880 5046760 observable, powerful.
5049280 5050600 It has to mean something.
5050680 5052240 Love has meaning, yes.
5052320 5055040 Social utility,<br />social bonding, child rearing...
5055120 5058640 We love people who have died.<br />Where's the social utility in that?
5059520 5060520 None.
5060600 5066280 Maybe it means something more,<br />something we can't yet understand.
5066360 5069480 Maybe it's some evidence, some...
5070680 5074720 artifact of a higher dimension<br />that we can't consciously perceive.
5075120 5079720 I'm drawn across the universe<br />to someone I haven't seen in a decade
5079800 5082200 who I know is probably dead.
5082760 5086120 Love is the one thing<br />we're capable of perceiving
5086200 5088560 that transcends dimensions<br />of time and space.
5090760 5094520 Maybe we should trust that,<br />even if we can't understand it yet.
5099720 5100920 All right, Cooper.
5103120 5104200 Yes...
5105440 5108520 the tiniest possibility<br />of seeing Wolf again excites me.
5109480 5110800 That doesn't mean I'm wrong.
5111720 5113400 Honestly, Amelia...
5115640 5116640 it might.
5123200 5125560 TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.
5142160 5143480 We'll lose about a third again.
5143680 5144760 But next year...
5147280 5149800 next year I'm gonna work<br />Nelson's farm and we'll make it up.
5150760 5152040 What happened to Nelson?
5158160 5160336 Murph, have you eaten enough?<br />Would you like some more soufflé?
5160360 5163200 Oh, no. I'm full, thanks.<br />It was delicious.
5164520 5166000 Coop, finish your fritter, please.
5168560 5170080 Will you spend the night?
5170160 5172040 Your room is exactly as you left it.
5172120 5173480 - It's ready.<br />- I need to get back.
5173720 5175456 My sewing machine is in there,<br />but there's plenty...
5175480 5177000 I need to...
5180240 5181360 Too many memories.
5182360 5183800 We might have something for that.
5184360 5185360 Hey, Coop.
5192400 5193400 The dust.
5196080 5197840 Lois, I have a friend who...
5198880 5200040 could look at his lungs.
5218000 5219000 Amelia, I'm sorry.
5219080 5220320 You were just being objective.
5220400 5223520 Unless you're punishing me<br />for screwing up on Miller's planet.
5223720 5226000 No, this wasn't a personal decision.
5226920 5230240 If you're wrong, you will have<br />a very personal decision to make.
5230680 5233800 Your fuel calculations<br />are based on a return journey.
5234200 5235880 Strike out on Mann's planet
5235960 5237800 and we'll have to decide<br />whether to return home
5238000 5240120 or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.
5240400 5244080 Starting a colony could save us<br />from extinction.
5244440 5247280 You might have to decide<br />between seeing your children again
5247600 5249200 and the future of the human race.
5250480 5251920 I trust you'll be as objective then.
5258800 5260720 He's been asking for you<br />since he came to.
5261200 5262320 We were trying to reach you.
5268400 5269440 Murph.
5270080 5271320 I'm here, Professor.
5272000 5274200 I let you all down.
5274600 5277640 No, you got us so far. Real close.
5279600 5281200 I'll finish what you started.
5281480 5283480 Good, good Murph.
5285880 5288000 You had faith...
5289240 5290360 all those...
5291480 5292920 all those years.
5294760 5295760 I...
5296120 5298480 I asked you to have faith.
5300160 5302520 I wanted you to believe...
5304360 5305880 that your father...
5309000 5310440 would come back.
5311040 5312600 I do, Professor.
5313600 5315120 Forgive me, Murph.
5315720 5317520 There's nothing to forgive.
5320440 5323240 I... I lied, Murph.
5325920 5327280 I lied to you.
5333640 5336800 There was no need for him to...
5337960 5339320 to come back.
5342200 5345520 There is no way to help us.
5346560 5347600 But Plan A...
5348120 5351400 All this. All these people.
5352200 5353880 And the equation.
5357920 5359320 Did my father know?
5363160 5364520 Did he leave me?
5368680 5369680 <i>Do...</i>
5370800 5372000 <i>not...</i>
5372960 5374040 <i>go...</i>
5375360 5376880 <i>gentle...</i>
5378840 5379880 No.
5381360 5382400 No!
5383600 5385000 You can't leave.
5385520 5386760 You... No.
5387880 5391000 Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you<br />that your father died today.
5391240 5392400 He had no pain.
5392800 5394120 He was at peace.
5395000 5396680 I'm very sorry for your loss.
5409320 5410640 Brand, did you know?
5413080 5414320 <i>He told you, right?</i>
5417560 5418640 <i>You knew.</i>
5420680 5422000 This was all a sham.
5426600 5428000 <i>You left us here.</i>
5430200 5431400 <i>To suffocate.</i>
5433680 5434920 <i>To starve.</i>
5461360 5462440 Frozen cloud.
5601040 5602040 It's okay.
5602640 5603760 It's okay.
5610640 5611680 It's okay.
5612080 5613080 Yeah.
5617160 5618520 Pray you never learn...
5620160 5622920 just how good it can be<br />to see another face.
5631520 5635760 I hadn't a lot of hope to begin with,<br />but after so long, I had none.
5637600 5640000 My supplies were<br />completely exhausted.
5642480 5645600 The last time I went to sleep,<br />I didn't even set a waking date.
5649680 5652000 You have literally raised me<br />from the dead.
5653120 5654160 Lazarus.
5656120 5657200 What about the others?
5657800 5659200 I'm afraid you're it, sir.
5659920 5662120 So far, surely.
5663000 5664880 No, our present situation is that
5664960 5667680 there's very little chance<br />of rescuing any others.
5671240 5672280 Dr. Mann.
5672640 5673720 Dr. Mann?
5674320 5675680 Tell us about your world.
5679080 5680680 Our world, we hope.
5684560 5686680 Our world is cold
5687080 5688160 stark...
5690000 5691640 but undeniably beautiful.
5693960 5696680 The days are 67 hours long, cold.
5701200 5702360 The nights are
5702600 5704600 67 far colder hours.
5710520 5714600 The gravity is a very, very pleasant<br />80% of the Earth's.
5714760 5717880 Now, up here where I landed,<br />the water is alkali
5717960 5719680 and the air has too much ammonia
5719760 5721136 to breathe for<br />more than just a few minutes
5721160 5723280 but down at the surface
5723920 5726000 and there is a surface
5726080 5727480 the chlorine dissipates.
5728120 5731520 The ammonia gives way to crystalline<br />hydrocarbons and breathable air.
5732120 5733200 To organics.
5733800 5735800 Possibly even to life.
5736880 5738400 We might be sharing this world.
5739520 5740960 These readings are from the surface?
5741000 5744000 Over the years,<br />I've dropped various probes.
5744600 5745880 How far have you explored?
5746360 5747960 I've mounted<br />several major expeditions.
5748040 5749560 But with oxygen in limited supply
5749640 5751520 KIPP there really did<br />most of the legwork.
5752040 5753480 What went wrong with him, sir?
5753560 5754720 Degeneration.
5754800 5758000 He misidentified the first organics<br />we found as ammonia crystals.
5758440 5762280 We struggled on for a time, but<br />ultimately I decommissioned him and
5762600 5764600 used his power source<br />to keep the mission going.
5765000 5767120 I thought I was alone<br />before I shut him down.
5767760 5769200 Would you like me to look at him?
5769880 5772080 No... He needs a human touch.
5772400 5776320 Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message<br />for you from the comm station.
5776720 5778880 Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.
5790680 5793400 <i>Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you<br />that your father died today.</i>
5793760 5794920 <i>He had no pain.</i>
5798240 5799400 <i>He was at peace.</i>
5801680 5803200 <i>I'm sorry for your loss.</i>
5805960 5807000 Is that Murph?
5807480 5809800 She's... She's grown.
5809880 5811120 <i>Brand, did you know?</i>
5812600 5813920 <i>He told you, right?</i>
5817120 5818200 <i>You knew.</i>
5820200 5821400 <i>This was all a sham.</i>
5822480 5823760 <i>You left us here.</i>
5826000 5827200 <i>To suffocate.</i>
5829560 5830680 <i>To starve.</i>
5834160 5835680 <i>Did my father know too?</i>
5838080 5839080 <i>Dad?</i>
5841160 5842600 <i>I just want to know...</i>
5844240 5846120 <i>if you left me here to die.</i>
5848640 5850240 <i>I just have to know.</i>
5856040 5857160 Cooper, my...
5858720 5860360 My father dedicated
5860960 5862760 his whole life to Plan A.
5862840 5865760 I have no idea<br />what she's talking about.
5867400 5868400 I do.
5873480 5876120 What, he never even hoped<br />to get the people off the Earth?
5877160 5878200 No.
5882200 5885600 But he's been trying to solve<br />the gravity equation for 40 years.
5886440 5889680 Amelia, your father solved<br />his equation before I even left.
5890440 5891960 Then why wouldn't he use it?
5892120 5895400 The equation couldn't reconcile<br />relativity with quantum mechanics.
5895480 5897680 - You need more.<br />- More? More what?
5898240 5901040 More data. You need<br />to see into a black hole.
5901120 5903360 The laws of nature prohibit<br />a naked singularity.
5903440 5904680 Romilly, is that true?
5906040 5909600 If a black hole is an oyster, then<br />the singularity's the pearl inside.
5909800 5912280 The gravity's so strong,<br />it's always hidden in darkness
5912360 5913680 behind the horizon.
5915320 5917120 That's why we call it a black hole.
5917360 5918480 Okay, but...
5919320 5921320 if we see beyond the horizon...
5921480 5922680 We can't, Coop.
5922960 5925000 There are some things<br />that aren't meant to be known.
5925440 5927160 Your father had to find another way
5927240 5929440 to save the human race<br />from extinction.
5929520 5931000 Plan B. A colony.
5931080 5932400 Why not tell people?
5934480 5936176 - Why keep building those stations?<br />- Because he knew
5936200 5938640 how hard it would be<br />to get people to work together
5938720 5940800 to save the species<br />instead of themselves.
5941680 5942680 Or their children.
5942960 5943960 Bullshit.
5944040 5946880 You never woulda come here unless you<br />believed you were gonna save them.
5946920 5949400 Evolution has yet to transcend<br />that simple barrier.
5949520 5951960 We can care deeply, selflessly
5952040 5953280 about those we know
5953360 5955920 but that empathy rarely extends<br />beyond our line of sight.
5956080 5957400 But the lie.
5960960 5963000 That monstrous lie?
5964200 5965320 Unforgivable.
5965760 5966880 And he knew that.
5967880 5970240 He was prepared<br />to destroy his own humanity
5970880 5973320 in order to save the species.<br />He made an incredible sacrifice.
5973400 5974400 No.
5975880 5978000 An incredible sacrifice is being made
5978080 5980520 by the people on Earth<br />who are gonna die!
5980920 5983000 Because in his fucking arrogance
5983480 5985200 he declared their case hopeless.
5986080 5987320 I'm sorry, Cooper
5988160 5989480 their case is hopeless.
5989560 5991720 No...
5992160 5993480 We are the future.
5997120 5998680 Cooper, what can I do?
6002200 6003400 Let me go home.
6004480 6006240 You're absolutely positive?
6007040 6009240 His solution was correct.<br />He'd had it for years.
6009880 6011000 It's worthless?
6011200 6012400 It's half the answer.
6013320 6016400 Okay, how do you find the other half?
6017040 6018400 Out there? A black hole.
6018640 6020360 But stuck down here on Earth?
6020440 6021440 Yeah?
6022680 6023920 I'm not sure you can.
6026080 6028560 God, they just pack up and leave.
6029960 6031680 What are they hoping to find?
6032600 6033600 Survival.
6040800 6041800 Damn it.
6044800 6046680 Murph, don't...
6047360 6048720 Don't people have a right to know?
6049000 6052880 No, panic won't help. We just have to<br />keep working, same as ever.
6053200 6054240 Yeah, but
6054320 6055976 isn't that exactly<br />what Professor Brand was
6056000 6057656 - manipulating us to do?<br />- Brand gave up on us.
6057680 6059200 I'm still trying to solve this.
6060160 6061160 So...
6062760 6064000 do you have an idea?
6064800 6065920 A feeling.
6069400 6070880 I told you about my ghost.
6073440 6075120 My dad thought I called it a ghost
6075440 6076800 because I was scared of it.
6080640 6082240 But I was never scared of it.
6083920 6086240 I called it a ghost<br />because it felt...
6089000 6090360 felt like a person.
6093240 6094920 It was trying to tell me something.
6097400 6100200 If there's an answer here on Earth,<br />it's back there
6100680 6102200 somehow, in that room.
6103120 6104320 So I have to find it.
6108040 6109520 We're running out of time.
6111640 6113520 <i>What about<br />auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?</i>
6113600 6115896 No, they can stay, CASE. I'll be<br />sleeping most of the way anyway.
6115920 6117200 - Hey, Coop.<br />- Yeah?
6117560 6119520 I have a suggestion<br />for your return journey.
6119600 6120600 Yeah, what's that?
6120680 6122280 Have one last crack<br />at the black hole.
6124200 6125280 I'm going home, Rom.
6125360 6128520 Yeah, I know. This isn't<br />going to cost you any time.
6129880 6131480 There's a chance<br />for the people on Earth.
6132000 6133040 - Talk to me.<br />- Gargantua's
6133120 6134800 an older spinning black hole.
6135040 6136280 It's what we call a...
6136360 6138800 - a gentle singularity.<br />- Gentle?
6138880 6140080 They're hardly gentle.
6140160 6142200 But the tidal gravity<br />is so quick that
6142320 6145680 something crossing the horizon fast<br />might survive.
6145760 6146760 A probe, say.
6146840 6148080 What happens after it crosses?
6148160 6151320 After the horizon is<br />a complete mystery.
6151560 6154400 So, what's to say<br />there isn't some way that the probe
6154480 6157040 can glimpse the singularity<br />and relay the quantum data?
6157440 6160600 If he's equipped to transmit<br />every form of energy that can pulse.
6160680 6163800 Just when did this probe<br />become a "he," Professor?
6164120 6165600 TARS is the obvious candidate.
6166560 6168280 I've already told him<br />what to look for.
6168360 6171000 I'd need the old optical transmitter<br />off KIPP, Cooper.
6171240 6172400 You'd do this for us?
6172600 6173640 Before you get all teary
6173720 6176400 try to remember that as a robot<br />I have to do anything you say.
6177360 6178600 Your cue light's broken.
6178760 6179880 I'm not joking.
6182880 6186040 I'm gonna need TARS to remove<br />and adapt some components from KIPP.
6186120 6188440 Well, I don't want to disturb<br />his archival functions.
6188520 6189760 I'll supervise.
6190400 6191400 All right.
6191480 6193640 Dr. Mann, we need<br />to find three secure sites.
6194080 6196280 One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.
6196360 6198536 Once those modules have landed,<br />you don't want to move them.
6198560 6201120 I can take you to the probe sites,<br />but I don't think these...
6201440 6203720 these conditions are gonna hold.<br />I think we should wait.
6204040 6206680 CASE is headed back down with<br />the rest of the distillery equipment.
6206840 6209320 I'd really like to secure<br />those sites by nightfall.
6211360 6214600 Well, these squalls<br />do usually blow over.
6214880 6216480 - Okay, then.<br />- But you're gonna need
6216560 6218080 - a long-range transmitter.<br />- Got it.
6218280 6219400 - Are you charged?<br />- Yeah.
6220280 6221280 Follow me.
6221960 6224120 TARS, 72 hours, yeah?
6224320 6225480 Roger that, Cooper.
6231560 6234120 Brand told me why you feel<br />you have to go back.
6235920 6238440 But I'd be remiss<br />if I didn't at least mention that
6239000 6242880 a mission such as ours could<br />certainly use an extra engineer.
6244720 6246800 You better slow down, turbo.
6247320 6249400 Safety first, CASE, remember.
6249480 6250920 <i>Safety first, Cooper.</i>
6252400 6255200 I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,<br />I'm honored to be a part of this.
6255560 6257360 But once we set up base camp
6257840 6260200 and secure those modules,<br />my work's done here.
6261040 6262120 I'm going home.
6269920 6271280 You have attachments.
6271720 6272880 But even without a family
6272960 6278080 I can promise you that that yearning<br />to be with other people is powerful.
6278520 6281680 That emotion is at the foundation
6282600 6285320 of what makes us human.<br />It's not to be taken lightly.
6293080 6294480 How long have you had that cough?
6294560 6295560 A while.
6305720 6307240 Mom lets me play in here.
6308920 6310200 I don't touch your stuff.
6340200 6341520 Just take this gently.
6347000 6349176 You know why we couldn't just<br />send machines on these missions
6349200 6350200 don't you, Cooper?
6350720 6352520 A machine doesn't improvise well
6352600 6354720 because you can't<br />program a fear of death.
6355960 6359560 Our survival instinct is our single<br />greatest source of inspiration.
6360040 6361360 Take you, for example.
6362360 6363360 A father...
6364160 6367080 with a survival instinct<br />that extends to your kids.
6368040 6369680 What does research tell us
6369760 6372240 is the last thing<br />you're gonna see before you die?
6374240 6375280 Your children.
6376000 6377040 Their faces.
6377120 6379320 At the moment of death,<br />your mind's gonna push
6379400 6380880 a little bit harder to survive.
6381800 6382840 For them.
6383640 6384720 Deep breath.
6387120 6390520 Hey. I bet you're Coop. Why don't you<br />have a seat here for me?
6390920 6392880 It's bad. They cannot stay here.
6394000 6395000 - Okay?<br />- Yeah.
6403040 6404480 TARS, what's taking so long?
6404560 6407080 Professor, I am having trouble<br />completing the boot up.
6407520 6408720 I don't understand.
6415560 6416640 It's funny.
6418840 6420160 When I left Earth...
6421280 6423040 I thought I was prepared to die.
6425240 6426360 The truth is...
6428560 6431360 I never really considered<br />the possibility
6431440 6433120 that my planet wasn't the one.
6436000 6438080 Nothing worked out the way<br />it was supposed to.
6438400 6439400 Let's go.
6447480 6450240 All right, hey, buddy, why don't you<br />give me a big deep breath?
6454920 6456120 What is this?
6456480 6457480 What are you doing?
6457560 6460320 I'm sorry! I can't let you<br />leave with that ship.
6460480 6462760 We're gonna need it<br />to complete the mission
6463040 6466280 once the others realize<br />what this place isn't.
6466600 6469320 We cannot survive here. I'm sorry!
6469680 6470720 I'm sorry!
6475240 6476320 No!
6480160 6481320 They can't stay here anymore.
6481360 6483000 You have to leave right now.
6483080 6485136 Okay, let me... let me make<br />something abundantly clear.
6485160 6486280 You have a responsibility...
6486480 6487720 Oh! Jesus!
6487800 6489400 Coop, get her stuff.<br />She's going home.
6490320 6492120 Dad didn't raise you<br />to be this dumb, Tom!
6492200 6493680 Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did.
6493760 6495880 And he's buried out back<br />with Mom and Jesse.
6496600 6498880 You faked all the data?
6500840 6501840 Yeah.
6505880 6507120 There's no surface?
6507400 6508400 No.
6509600 6511440 I tried to do my duty, Cooper
6511520 6514680 but I knew<br />the day that I arrived here
6515120 6516520 that this place had nothing.
6516960 6520520 And I resisted<br />the temptation for years
6521400 6523480 but I... I knew that
6523560 6528320 if I just pressed that button, then<br />somebody would come and save me.
6529560 6531080 You fucking coward.
6532080 6533080 Yes.
6537880 6538880 Yes.
6540800 6541800 Yes.
6542960 6544000 Yes.
6555040 6557560 Listen, if you're not gonna go,<br />let your family go.
6557640 6559400 Just, like, save your family.
6560000 6562280 And we go live underground with you?
6562360 6564120 Pray that Daddy comes to save us?
6564200 6566880 Dad's not coming back.<br />He never was coming back.
6567160 6568160 It's up to me.
6568240 6569600 You're gonna save everybody?
6569880 6570960 Because Dad couldn't do it.
6571000 6572720 Dad didn't even try!
6572800 6574600 Dad just abandoned us!
6575560 6577240 He left us here to die.
6578240 6579600 Nobody's going with you.
6583320 6585520 You gonna wait<br />for your next kid to die?
6588720 6589720 Get out.
6591040 6592160 And don't come back.
6596720 6598160 You can keep my stuff.
6608920 6609920 Stop it!
6613080 6614520 No. No!
6615520 6618400 Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance<br />you're gonna kill yourself!
6619480 6621320 Those are the best odds<br />I've had in years.
6640760 6642400 Don't judge me, Cooper.
6643320 6645200 You were never tested like I was.
6646280 6647480 Few men have been.
6655680 6656840 You tried your best, Murph.
6665760 6667200 You're feeling it, aren't you?
6668480 6670120 The survival instinct.
6671200 6672520 That's what drove me.
6672600 6675320 It's what drives all of us.<br />And it's what's gonna save us.
6676480 6679520 Because I want to save all of us.<br />For you, Cooper.
6684680 6688200 I'm sorry, I can't... I can't watch<br />you go through this. I'm sorry.
6688280 6690800 I thought I could, but I can't.
6692000 6694120 I'm here. I'm here for you.
6694200 6696000 Just listen to my voice, Cooper.
6697080 6698120 I'm right here.
6700040 6701160 You're not alone.
6710960 6712320 Do you see your children?
6715360 6716440 It's okay.
6717440 6718800 They're right there with you.
6722960 6725480 Did Professor Brand tell you<br />that poem before you left?
6726240 6727400 Do you remember?
6729840 6732720 <i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>
6734160 6738520 <i>Old age should burn and rave<br />at close of day</i>
6740080 6743080 <i>Rage, rage against<br />the dying of the light</i>
6765960 6767640 Brand! Help!
6767720 6769520 - <i>Help...!</i><br />- Cooper?
6776120 6777120 CASE!
6777760 6778800 No air.
6779680 6780680 Ammonia.
6781800 6784320 Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE!
6784600 6786360 - I have a fix.<br />- Go...!
6786440 6788000 And away!
6799840 6801920 Cooper, we're coming.<br />Hang in there. Don't talk.
6802000 6804280 Try to breathe as little as possible.<br />We're almost there.
6807640 6809280 There's a security lockout, sir.
6809360 6812520 It requires a person<br />to access function.
6817720 6818720 It's all yours, sir.
6826880 6828000 <i>Try not to breathe.</i>
6829360 6830440 <i>We're coming...</i>
6830520 6832520 <i>We're coming right now.<br />CASE, come on! Come on!</i>
6832880 6834296 <i>We got to go faster, CASE!<br />We gotta go faster.</i>
6834320 6836080 <i>Faster...! Cooper.</i>
6840160 6841600 Hang in there. Come on.
6848000 6851480 I see him... CASE, bank! Bank right!
6869400 6871040 Cooper...!
6871600 6872600 I'm here!
6894720 6896640 This data makes no sense.
6904640 6905640 I'm sorry.
6906120 6907120 What?
6907200 6908720 Mann was lying!
6916040 6917680 Go...
6919040 6920040 Romilly.
6920240 6921280 <i>Romilly!</i>
6921600 6923600 <i>Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly?</i>
6923880 6924880 - <i>Romilly!</i><br />- Step back
6924960 6926760 - Professor! Step back!<br />- <i>Please don't make...</i>
6933720 6934720 <i>Romilly...</i>
6934960 6936600 <i>Romilly, do you... do you read me?</i>
6939280 6940320 Keep watch!
6941680 6942680 Lois?
6943240 6944600 What happened to caution, CASE?
6944680 6945800 Safety first, Cooper.
6946920 6949880 Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?<br />This is Brand.
6953160 6954160 Romilly?
6954240 6956520 Dr. Brand. Cooper.<br />There's been an explosion.
6957320 6958800 Dr. Mann's compound.
6985480 6987200 TARS... ten o'clock!
6993720 6995200 Let me know when TARS is aboard.
6998600 7000320 Romilly did not survive.
7002040 7003320 I could not save him.
7003400 7005160 - TARS is in.<br />- I'll take her from here.
7005240 7006336 Do we have a fix on the Ranger?
7006360 7007480 He's pushing into orbit!
7008000 7010680 If he takes control of<br />that ship, we're dead.
7012080 7013200 He'd maroon us?
7013520 7015080 He is marooning us.
7016840 7018880 I'll meet you guys downstairs.<br />Go wait by the car.
7026760 7028760 Come on! Gimme your bag.
7028840 7030960 Go, get in the back seat.<br />Get in the backseat now!
7036240 7038120 <i>Dr. Mann, please respond.</i>
7038640 7040720 Dr. Mann, please respond!
7041000 7042960 He doesn't know<br />the Endurance docking procedure.
7043040 7044280 No, the autopilot does.
7044360 7045680 Not since TARS disabled it.
7047280 7049200 Nice. What's<br />your trust setting, TARS?
7049280 7050680 Lower than yours apparently.
7054200 7057600 <i>Do not attempt docking.<br />I repeat, do not attempt docking.</i>

7123120 7124440 <i>Unauthorized.</i>

7130280 7132800 do not attempt docking.<br />Please resp...
7174920 7176680 Moving slowly toward the Endurance.
7200440 7201920 <i>Imperfect contact.</i>
7202000 7203720 - Override.<br />- <i>Hatch lockout.</i>
7211440 7212640 Is he locked on yet?
7212720 7213800 Imperfectly.
7215840 7217000 Dr. Mann, do not...
7237440 7239880 <i>Hatch lockout disengaged.</i>
7248640 7252440 Dr. Mann, do not,<br />I repeat, do not open the hatch.
7252520 7253880 I repeat, do not open the hatch.
7253960 7256720 If you open the hatch,<br />the airlock will depressurize.
7281880 7283216 What happens if he blows the airlock?
7283240 7284240 Nothing good.
7289760 7291376 Okay, pull back, pull back.<br />Retro thrusters
7291400 7292456 everything we've got, CASE!
7292480 7293760 - Thrusters are full!<br />- Back!
7293960 7296080 CASE, relay my transmission<br />to the on board computer
7296160 7298200 and have it rebroadcast<br />as emergency P.A.
7298920 7299960 Dr. Mann...
7300560 7301760 <i>open the inner hatch.</i>
7301840 7303920 <i>I repeat, do not open<br />the inner hatch.</i>
7304000 7305800 - <i>I repeat, do not open...</i><br />- Brand?
7306720 7308240 <i>I don't know what he said to you</i>
7308680 7310800 but I am taking command<br />of the Endurance.
7311680 7313720 <i>And then we can talk<br />about completing the mission.</i>
7316800 7318640 Dr. Mann, listen to me.
7319200 7320880 This is not about my life.
7321720 7324480 Or Cooper's life.<br />This is about all mankind.
7325640 7326680 There is a moment...
7333040 7334200 It is not s...
7342560 7343560 Oh, my God.
7360840 7362840 Cooper there's no point<br />using your fuel
7362920 7364680 - to chase...<br />- Analyze the Endurance's spin.
7369480 7370560 Cooper, what are you doing?
7370840 7371840 Docking.
7376040 7378800 Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.
7378880 7381360 Okay, get ready to match our spin<br />with the retro thrusters.
7381520 7382560 It's not possible.
7382640 7384800 No. It's necessary.
7395960 7397680 Endurance is hitting stratosphere!
7402080 7403520 She's got no heat shield.
7406800 7408560 - CASE, you ready?<br />- Ready.
7416560 7419400 Cooper! This is no time for caution.
7421200 7423280 CASE, if I black out,<br />you take the stick.
7423720 7426040 TARS, get ready to engage<br />the docking mechanism.
7432760 7434280 Endurance is starting to heat.
7434440 7435640 20 feet out.
7435960 7438200 I need three degrees<br />starboard, Cooper.
7438440 7439640 Ten feet out.
7440480 7442920 Cooper, we are lined up.
7443240 7444400 Initiating spin!
7484560 7485680 Come on, TARS.
7493400 7494720 Come on, TARS!
7505520 7508000 - We are locked, Cooper.<br />- Locked. Easing up!
7515400 7516440 Easy.
7517800 7519120 Easy.
7524720 7526120 Retro thrusters!
7533960 7535120 Main engines on.
7540880 7543560 Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.
7551280 7552480 Killing main engines!
7554080 7555360 Okay, we're out of orbit.
7562680 7563680 Okay.
7564080 7565600 And for our next trick!
7567200 7570560 It'll have to be good.<br />We're heading into Gargantua's pull.
7571760 7572800 Oh, shit.
7573200 7575000 - CASE, take the stick.<br />- Roger that.
7622840 7625520 Cooper, we're slipping<br />towards Gargantua.
7626280 7627760 Shall I use main engines?
7628360 7629360 No.
7629880 7631880 We got to let her slide<br />as far as we can.
7640600 7641720 Give it to me.
7641800 7643520 There's good news,<br />there's bad news, Cooper.
7643560 7645120 Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS.
7646160 7647160 Give it to me straight.
7655560 7656760 The backup generator kicked in
7656800 7658520 so the system's stable.<br />They're all good.
7658600 7659640 Good.
7660000 7661000 Okay.
7661400 7663640 The navigational hub<br />has been completely destroyed.
7663720 7666200 We don't have enough life support<br />to make it back to Earth, but
7666520 7668520 I think we can scratch<br />our way to Edmunds' planet.
7668720 7669840 Well, what about fuel?
7670160 7672680 Not enough. But I have a plan.
7673200 7677200 We let Gargantua pull us down<br />close to her horizon.
7677520 7680720 Then a powered slingshot around,<br />launching us towards Edmunds' planet.
7680800 7681800 Manually?
7681880 7683080 That's what I'm here for.
7683400 7685400 I'm gonna take us<br />just inside the critical orbit.
7685840 7687200 What about the time slippage?
7687280 7690480 Neither of us has time to worry about<br />relativity right now, Dr. Brand.
7694560 7696080 I'm sorry, Cooper.
7699200 7702200 Once we've gathered<br />enough speed around Gargantua
7702600 7704160 we use Lander One
7704800 7707600 and Ranger Two as rocket boosters to
7707920 7709920 push us out of<br />the black hole's gravity.
7712400 7714600 <i>The Lander's linkages<br />have been destroyed</i>
7715120 7717040 <i>so we'll have to control manually.</i>
7718520 7721200 Once Lander one is spent,<br />TARS will detach
7721720 7723680 and get sucked into that black hole.
7724320 7725600 Why does TARS have to detach?
7725680 7728120 We have to shed the weight<br />to escape the gravity.
7728320 7729760 Newton's third law.
7729840 7732560 The only way humans have ever<br />figured out of getting somewhere
7732640 7733920 is to leave something behind.
7734320 7737200 Cooper, you can't ask TARS<br />to do this for us.
7737280 7741000 He's a robot. So you don't have<br />to ask him to do anything.
7741280 7742520 <i>Cooper, you asshole!</i>
7742840 7744520 Sorry, you broke up<br />a little bit there.
7745000 7746880 It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.
7747560 7749840 It's our only chance<br />to save people on Earth.
7749920 7753080 If I can find a way to transmit<br />the quantum data I'll find in there
7753520 7754760 they might still make it.
7756240 7758280 Let's just hope<br />there's still someone there to save.
7786080 7787600 Maximum velocity achieved.
7788720 7790640 Prepare to fire escape thrusters.
7791400 7792400 Ready?
7792640 7793640 Ready.
7793920 7794920 Ready.
7795000 7796800 Main engine ignition in three...
7797320 7798360 two...
7798880 7800720 one. Mark.
7813400 7814640 Come on, baby.
7815880 7817880 Lander One engines, on my mark.
7818400 7819400 Three...
7819640 7820720 two...
7820800 7822760 one. Mark.
7827480 7829800 Ranger Two engines, on my mark.
7830120 7832600 Three, two, one.
7833160 7834200 - Mark.<br />- Fire!
7843760 7846800 This little maneuver's<br />gonna cost us 51 years!
7847800 7850080 You don't sound so bad<br />for pushing 120!
7864720 7867880 Lander One, prepare<br />to detach on my mark.
7868400 7870800 Three, two...
7871560 7873400 one. Mark.
7873480 7874560 Detach!
7877480 7878560 <i>Goodbye, TARS.</i>
7879200 7881520 Goodbye, Dr. Brand.<br />See you on the other side, Coop.
7881920 7883120 See you there, Slick!
7891160 7892400 Okay, CASE.
7893320 7895000 Nice reckless flying!
7895440 7896640 Learned from the master.
7897360 7899600 Ranger Two, prepare to detach.
7899680 7901560 What? No... Cooper!
7901640 7903200 - Three...<br />- Cooper, what are you doing?
7903280 7904680 Newton's third law.
7905040 7906880 - You got to leave something behind.<br />- Two...
7906960 7909040 You told me we had<br />enough resources for both of us.
7909120 7910880 - One.<br />- <i>We agreed, Amelia...</i>
7911600 7913320 - 90%.<br />- Mark.
7914600 7915600 Don't.
7917800 7918840 Detach.
7931560 7934160 Okay, I am nosing down.
7937880 7939440 Approaching the event horizon.
7941880 7944120 Portside, dipping down beneath it
7944720 7945920 to go through it.
7947720 7950320 <i>Heading towards blackness.</i>
7950840 7952240 <i>I have a visual of the event.</i>
7953240 7954280 It's all black.
7956680 7957880 TARS, do you read me?
7958440 7959680 It's all blackness.
7961840 7964000 TARS. Do you read me? Over.
7968440 7969440 Okay.
7970600 7971680 Screens...
7973320 7974560 getting interference.
7976320 7978640 Losing control of the stick.<br />I got flashes.
7979400 7981320 Flashes of lightness and blackness.
7982880 7985800 The turbulence in the gravity<br />is increasing.
7991480 7992880 The computers are going down.
8004840 8007240 Gravitational pull.<br />I'm losing control of the stick.
8039560 8041240 Murph? Murph, come on!

8197200 8198240 No...!
8255360 8257200 If you're leaving, just go.
8257560 8258800 No...
8260400 8262440 No, don't go. Don't go, you idiot.
8262520 8263520 Don't go!
8265760 8267200 Morse...
8268040 8269040 Morse.

8312560 8314360 Come on. Come on, Murph...
8314440 8315440 Murph, come on!
8315520 8317200 What's it say? What's it say, Murph?
8317880 8318880 What's it say?
8329000 8330040 "Stay."
8364400 8365560 Tell him, Murph.
8365920 8367000 Make him stay.
8369840 8371920 Make... Make him stay, Murph.
8380600 8382200 Make him stay, Murph.
8383960 8385680 Don't let me leave, Murph!
8389680 8391440 Don't let me leave, Murph!
8396840 8399360 No...!
8419040 8420080 It was you.
8431480 8433000 You were my ghost.
8442680 8445800 <i>Cooper... Come in, Cooper.</i>
8447280 8448360 TARS?
8448440 8449440 <i>Roger that.</i>
8451400 8452600 You survived.
8452680 8453760 <i>Somewhere...</i>
8454480 8458200 <i>in their fifth dimension.<br />They saved us.</i>
8458800 8461640 Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?
8461960 8463720 And just why would<br />they want to help us?
8463800 8466760 <i>I don't know, but they constructed<br />this three-dimensional space</i>
8466840 8470000 <i>inside their five-dimensional reality<br />to allow you to understand it.</i>
8470080 8471520 Yeah, that ain't working.
8472160 8473240 <i>Yes, it is.</i>
8473720 8477000 <i>You've seen that time is represented<br />here as a physical dimension.</i>
8477680 8480760 <i>You have worked out that you can<br />exert a force across space-time.</i>
8480840 8484280 Yeah, gravity to send a message.
8484520 8485560 <i>Affirmative.</i>
8488240 8489360 Gravity...
8490480 8493600 can cross the dimensions,<br />including time.
8494000 8495120 <i>Apparently.</i>
8498920 8500760 Do you have the quantum data?
8501200 8502520 <i>Roger. I have it.</i>
8503760 8505800 <i>I am transmitting it<br />on all wavelengths</i>
8505880 8507600 <i>but nothing is getting out, Cooper.</i>
8507800 8509760 I can do this...
8510160 8512920 <i>But such complicated data to a child?</i>
8513000 8514000 Not just any child.
8514480 8515600 What else?
8516120 8517520 Oh, come on, Dad.
8520640 8522240 Murph, the fire's out! Come on!
8522320 8523720 <i>Even if you communicate it here</i>
8523800 8526200 <i>she won't understand<br />its significance for years.</i>
8527120 8528360 I get that, TARS.
8528640 8530480 All right, but we've gotta<br />figure something out
8530560 8533360 or the people on Earth<br />are gonna die. Think...!
8533440 8534520 <i>Cooper...</i>
8535040 8537080 <i>they didn't bring us here<br />to change the past.</i>
8540880 8541920 Say that again.
8542440 8545480 <i>They didn't bring us here<br />to change the past.</i>
8550000 8551760 No, they didn't bring us here at all.
8556480 8557720 We brought ourselves.
8566720 8571000 TARS, give me the coordinates<br />for NASA in binary.
8571200 8573200 <i>In binary. Roger. Feeding data.</i>
8597000 8598320 "It's not a ghost."
8600600 8601800 "It's gravity."
8602120 8603480 Don't you get it yet, TARS?
8604440 8605760 I brought myself here!
8607040 8609920 We're here to communicate<br />with the three-dimensional world.
8610680 8611760 We're the bridge!
8620000 8621320 I thought they chose me.
8625000 8626680 But they didn't choose me,<br />they chose her.
8626760 8627920 <i>For what, Cooper?</i>
8630720 8632000 To save the world.
8636320 8639200 All of this is<br />one little girl's bedroom.
8639280 8640520 Every moment.
8641040 8642320 It's infinitely complex.
8642400 8644680 They have access<br />to infinite time and space
8644760 8646720 but they're not bound by anything!
8646800 8650480 They can't find<br />a specific place in time.
8650560 8651720 They can't communicate.
8653040 8655920 That's why I'm here.<br />I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph
8656000 8657320 just like I found this moment.
8657400 8659680 - <i>How, Cooper?</i><br />- Love, TARS, love.
8659960 8661000 It's just like Brand said.
8661080 8664480 My connection with Murph,<br />it is quantifiable. It's the key!
8664560 8665760 <i>What are we here to do?</i>
8667320 8668440 Find how to tell her.
8671640 8672680 The watch.
8675880 8676920 The watch.
8678400 8679440 That's it.
8681920 8684320 We code the data into<br />the movement of the second hand.
8688200 8691360 TARS, translate the data into Morse<br />and feed it to me.
8691440 8695200 <i>Translating data to Morse. Cooper,<br />what if she never came back for it?</i>
8697040 8699800 She will...
8701080 8702440 Murph, I can see his car!
8703720 8704760 He's coming, Murph!
8706480 8708320 Okay. I'm coming down.
8709560 8710840 <i>How do you know?</i>
8714160 8715800 Because I gave it to her.
8721080 8723200 <i>Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.</i>
8727080 8728080 Dot-dot...
8729160 8730840 dash-dot.
8731280 8732880 <i>Dot-dash-dot-dot.</i>
8733360 8735880 Dot-dash-dot-dot.
8736200 8737720 <i>Dash-dash-dash.</i>
8737800 8740120 Dash, dash, dash.
8757320 8758360 He came back!
8759480 8763320 It was him all the time!<br />I didn't know. It was him!
8764600 8766120 Dad's gonna save us.
8807560 8808800 Eureka!
8812240 8813560 It's traditional.
8817840 8819720 Eureka!
8824080 8825120 Did it work?
8825720 8827040 <i>I think it might have.</i>
8828960 8830800 - How do you know?<br />- <i>Because</i>
8830880 8833000 <i>the bulk beings<br />are closing the tesseract.</i>
8837120 8838680 Don't you get it yet, TARS?
8840040 8841360 They're not "beings."
8842560 8843560 They're us.
8845800 8848640 What I've been doing for Murph,<br />they're doing for me.
8849360 8850400 For all of us.
8850720 8852560 <i>Cooper, people couldn't build this.</i>
8853120 8855360 No. No, not yet.
8856000 8857040 But one day.
8857760 8859000 Not you and me.
8859800 8860880 But people.
8861640 8865200 <i>A civilization that's evolved<br />past the four dimensions we know.</i>
8871760 8872800 What happens now?
8933320 8934400 Mr. Cooper.
8938720 8940120 All right. Let's take it slow, sir.
8940680 8942000 Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.
8942920 8944760 Remember, you're no<br />spring chicken anymore.
8944840 8947280 Actually, you are 124 years old.
8954480 8955520 Take it slow, sir.
8956720 8958640 You were extremely lucky.
8959320 8962000 The Rangers found you with only<br />minutes left in your oxygen supply.
8975880 8977000 Where am I?
8978880 8979920 Cooper Station.
8981720 8983120 Currently orbiting Saturn.
8985040 8986920 Cooper Station.
8989600 8991440 Nice of you to name it after me.
8995120 8996400 - What?<br />- The station
8996480 8997640 isn't named after you, sir.
8997720 8999320 It's... It's named<br />after your daughter.
8999920 9002840 Although she's always maintained<br />just how important you were.
9002920 9004160 Is she still alive?
9006400 9007880 She'll be here in a couple weeks.
9009160 9011520 She is far too old to be transferring<br />from another station
9011600 9013280 but when she heard<br />that you'd been found...
9015040 9017600 well, this is... this is<br />Murphy Cooper we're talking about.
9018440 9019680 Yes, it is.
9022240 9024280 We'll have you checked out of here<br />in a couple days.
9027200 9029520 I'm sure you'll be excited<br />to see what's in store.
9030600 9034560 I actually did a paper on you<br />in high school.
9034640 9036520 I know all about<br />your life back on Earth.
9038480 9039480 Oh, yeah.
9039920 9040920 Right.
9043360 9048200 If... If you'll follow me, we've got<br />a really good situation for you.
9051560 9055200 So, when I made my suggestion<br />to Miss Cooper
9056440 9059240 I was delighted to hear<br />that she thought it was perfect.
9062480 9065520 It was just constant.<br />Just that steady blow of dirt.
9065600 9068400 Of course, I... I didn't<br />speak to her personally.
9068480 9070400 <i>We always set the plate upside-down.</i>
9070480 9073120 <i>Glasses or cups,<br />whatever it was, upside-down.</i>
9073480 9078000 <i>Well, my dad was a farmer.<br />Like everybody else back then.</i>
9078320 9080800 <i>There just wasn't enough food.</i>
9080880 9082800 <i>We wore little things</i>
9083480 9085200 <i>little strips of sheet with</i>
9085280 9088760 <i>sometimes over our nose and mouth<br />so we wouldn't breathe...</i>
9088840 9091680 <i>Well, it was pretty exciting for me<br />because it was hope.</i>
9092200 9093760 <i>I don't care who describes that...</i>
9093840 9095280 <i>That no one exaggerates that.</i>
9095360 9096400 <i>There is no way for it...</i>
9096480 9099880 She did confirm<br />just how much you loved farming.
9100320 9101880 - Oh, she did, did she?<br />- Yeah.
9101960 9103000 Come here.
9103760 9104760 Home sweet home.
9105120 9108280 Everything replaced<br />and put back where it...
9114720 9116280 - Hey, is this...<br />- Oh, yeah.
9116360 9119800 The... The machine we found out<br />near Saturn when we found you. Yes.
9120120 9121120 Its power source was shot
9121200 9122496 but we could get you<br />another one if you want.
9122520 9124400 Yes. Please.
9125800 9126800 Settings.
9127520 9128760 General settings.
9129480 9130880 Security settings.
9133840 9135760 Honesty, new setting:
9137080 9138520 95%.
9138840 9141400 Confirmed. Additional customization?
9142200 9143240 Humor:
9144840 9146160 75%.
9146520 9147520 Confirmed.
9148320 9151560 Auto self-destruct<br />T-minus ten, nine...
9151640 9153120 Let's make that 60%.
9155640 9157320 60% confirmed.
9158320 9159360 Knock-knock.
9159560 9161000 You want 55?
9166000 9167560 Is this really what it was like?
9170200 9171920 It was never this clean, Slick.
9176840 9180720 I don't care much for this pretending<br />we're back where we started.
9182280 9184200 I wanna know where we are.
9186080 9187320 Where we're going.
9191840 9192960 - Mr. Cooper.<br />- Yeah.
9193040 9194520 The family's all in there.
9195120 9196120 Family?
9196200 9197600 Yeah, they all came out to see her.
9197640 9199800 She's been in cryo-sleep<br />for almost two years.
9231600 9233400 You told them I like farming.
9239040 9240480 It was me, Murph.
9243280 9244720 I was your ghost.
9246080 9247320 I know.
9249400 9250840 People didn't believe me.
9250920 9253640 They thought<br />that I was doing it all myself.
9254040 9255040 But...
9257840 9259360 I knew who it was.
9264280 9266000 Nobody believed me.
9267000 9268920 But I knew you'd come back.
9271640 9272640 How?
9274720 9277520 Because my dad promised me.
9283640 9285240 Well, I'm here now, Murph.
9286720 9287760 I'm here.
9289400 9290480 No.
9292720 9296400 No parent should have to watch<br />their own child die.
9299400 9301720 I have my kids here for me now.
9304440 9305760 You go.
9308920 9310120 Where?
9313880 9314880 Brand.
9324280 9326320 <i>She's out there...</i>
9331960 9333400 <i>setting up camp.</i>
9359600 9360720 <i>Alone...</i>
9362240 9364320 <i>in a strange galaxy.</i>
9375200 9379880 <i>Maybe right now<br />she's settling in for the long nap...</i>
9397240 9399680 <i>by the light of our new sun...</i>
9414720 9416640 <i>in our new home.</i>
