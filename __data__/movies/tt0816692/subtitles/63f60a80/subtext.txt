74951 77137 <i>Well, my dad was a farmer.</i>
78204 80765 Um, like everybody<br />else back then.
82792 85061 <i>Of course, he didn't<br />start that way.</i>
91259 93045 Computer says you're too tight.
93145 95989 - Nah, I got this.<br />- Crossing the Straights.
98308 100160 <i>- Shutting it down, Cooper.<br />- No!</i>
101561 104080 <i>- Shutting it all down.</i><br />- No, I need power up!
108318 109461 Dad?
115909 118645 Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.
118745 121347 - I thought you were the ghost.<br />- No.
122916 124985 There are no such things<br />as ghosts, babe.
125085 127353 Grandpa says you can get ghosts.
128672 133626 Maybe that's because Grandpa's a little too<br />close to being one himself. Back to bed.
133760 135695 Were you dreaming<br />about the crash?
137013 139407 Get your butt back in bed, Murph.
166334 167936 <i>The wheat had died.</i>
168670 171105 <i>The blight came and<br />we had to burn it.</i>
171423 174701 <i>And we still had corn.<br />We had acres of corn.</i>
174801 177153 But, uh... mostly we had dust.
179472 182167 <i>I guess I can't describe it.<br />It was just constant.</i>
182267 186246 Just that steady blow of dirt.
188231 191384 <i>We wore, um...<br />little strips of sheet...</i>
191484 194262 sometimes over our<br />nose and mouth...
194362 196965 <i>so that we wouldn't breathe<br />so much of it.</i>
198575 202254 <i>Well, when we set the table,<br />we always set the plate upside-down.</i>
202354 205598 Glasses or cups,<br />whatever it was upside-down.
210920 213039 Shake a leg! Murph,<br />get a move on!
213139 216868 Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn,<br />Herbicide Resistance 101.
216968 218570 - Check?<br />- Yes, sir.
220013 221781 Not at the table, Murph.
222432 224367 Dad, can you fix this?
225852 227550 What the heck<br />did you do to my lander?
227575 228575 Wasn't me.
228588 230632 Let me guess.<br />It was your ghost?
230732 233134 It knocked it off.<br />It keeps knocking books off.
233234 235114 - No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.<br />- Hey.
235159 237372 I looked it up. It's<br />called a poltergeist.
237396 238415 Dad, tell her.
238515 240600 Well, it's not very<br />scientific, Murph.
240700 243103 You said science was about admitting<br />what we don't know.
243303 247140 - She's got you there.<br />- Hey. Start looking after our stuff.
248666 249976 Coop.
252070 254939 All right, Murph,<br />you want to talk science?
255799 259119 Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.<br />No, you got to go further.
259219 262055 You got to record the facts, analyze,<br />get to the how and the why...
262155 265575 then present your conclusions.<br />Deal?
266142 267660 - Deal.<br />- All right.
270396 272665 - Have a good day at school.<br />- Hold up.
272899 277387 Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.<br />Not grandparent.
279572 281507 Slow down, turbo!
282742 286037 - That's not a dust storm.<br />- Nelson's torching his whole crop.
286137 287180 Blight?
287280 290099 They're saying<br />it's the last harvest for okra.
290667 291935 Ever.
293653 296448 He should've planted corn<br />like the rest of us.
296548 299325 Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley.<br />She's single.
299425 300994 What's that supposed to mean?
301094 304289 Repopulating the earth.<br />Start pulling your weight, young man.
304389 308451 Why don't you start<br />minding your own business, old man?
315650 317418 All right, Murph,<br />give me second.
318945 320254 Uh-huh.
320738 322182 Third.
323658 325393 - Find a gear, dumb-ass.<br />- Grind it!
325493 326636 Shut it, Tom!
327912 330415 - What'd you do, Murph?<br />- Ah, she didn't do nothing.
330515 333017 - Blew a tire is all.<br />- Murphy's Law.
333751 334751 Shut up!
334832 337105 - Grab the spare, Tom.<br />- That is the spare.
339632 341234 Get the patch kit!
342427 345705 - How am I supposed to patch it out here?<br />- You got to figure it out.
345805 347865 I'm not always gonna be here<br />to help you.
356190 358009 What's going on, Murph?
358109 361387 Why did you and Mom name me<br />after something that's bad?
361487 364841 - We didn't.<br />- Murphy's Law?
365700 369854 Murphy's Law doesn't mean<br />that something bad will happen.
369954 373399 What it means is<br />whatever can happen will happen.
373499 376144 And that sounded<br />just fine with us.
380256 381899 Whoa!
382583 383776 Get in.
385053 386571 Get in, let's go.
387805 390033 What about the flat tire?
392894 394328 Yeah.
408201 412272 It's an Indian Air Force drone.<br />Solar cells could power an entire farm.
412372 413931 Take the wheel, Tom.
419295 420730 Go, go, go!
422215 423983 Keep that aimed right at it.
432008 434527 Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.
434894 436037 Right at it.
437738 438981 Stay on it.
440266 441550 Here we go.
444070 445379 Whoa.
450410 452095 Nice one, Tom.
458559 459936 Dad?
460253 463106 I almost got it. Don't stop.<br />Don't stop!
463464 466117 - Dad!<br />- Tom!
470596 473032 You told me to keep driving.
473766 478329 Well, I guess that answers the old "If I<br />asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.
481441 484377 - We lost it.<br />- No, we didn't.
496956 498724 Want to give it a whirl?
504630 506107 This way.
511387 512572 Go.
513473 516576 Let's lay her down right there<br />at the edge of the reservoir.
520772 522582 Nicely done.
525485 527428 How long you think it's been up there?
527528 530139 Delhi Mission Control<br />went down, same as ours...
530239 532175 - ...ten years ago.<br />- Heh.
532408 534427 So for ten years?
537288 539983 - Why did it come down so low?<br />- I don't know.
540083 543069 Maybe the sun cooked its brain<br />or it was looking for something.
543169 545521 - What?<br />- Give me a large flatblade.
545838 548608 Maybe some kind of signal?<br />I don't know.
553863 555364 What are you gonna do with it?
556182 559452 I'm gonna give it something<br />socially responsible to do...
560228 561662 like drive a combine.
562146 563748 Can't we just let it go?
565942 567710 It wasn't hurting anybody.
569278 573674 This thing needs to learn how to adapt,<br />Murph... like the rest of us.
578162 580274 How's this work?<br />You guys come with?
580374 583876 I've got class.<br />This one needs to wait.
585419 588281 - What did you do?<br />- They'll tell you about it in there.
588381 590616 - Am I gonna be mad?<br />- Not with me.
590716 593986 - Just please try not to.<br />- Hey. Relax.
595304 596739 I got this.
601093 603963 - Little late, Coop.<br />- Yeah, we had a flat.
604063 607708 And I guess you had to stop off<br />at the Asian fighter plane store.
607900 611554 No, actually, sir,<br />that's a surveillance drone.
611654 614507 With outstanding solar cells.<br />It's Indian.
614824 616259 Take a seat.
617285 618886 So, uh...
619495 622181 we got Tom's scores back.
622623 624650 He's going to make<br />an excellent farmer.
624750 628321 Yeah, he's got a knack for it.<br />What about college?
628421 632241 The university only takes a handful.<br />They don't have the resources to...
632341 634702 I still pay my taxes.
634802 636904 Where's that money go?<br />There's no more armies.
637305 639740 Well, it doesn't go<br />to the university.
640424 645113 - Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.<br />- You're ruling my son out for college now?
645354 648958 - The kid's 15.<br />- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
649859 652128 What's your waistline?<br />About what, 32?
652445 656182 - About a 33 inseam?<br />- I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.
656282 660803 It takes two numbers to measure your ass<br />but only one to measure my son's future?
661579 664524 Come on.<br />You're a well-educated man, Coop.
664624 666684 - And a trained pilot.<br />- And an engineer.
667084 672198 Okay, well, right now<br />we don't need more engineers.
672298 676836 We didn't run out of television screens<br />and planes. We ran out of food.
676969 680456 The world needs farmers.<br />Good farmers, like you.
680556 683034 - And Tom.<br />- Uneducated farmers.
683851 687839 We're a caretaker generation, Coop.<br />And things are getting better.
687939 691167 - Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...<br />- Are we done here, sir?
692360 693544 No.
694278 696547 Miss Hanley's here<br />to talk about Murph.
696781 699392 Murph is a great kid.<br />She's really bright.
699492 701811 But she's been having<br />a little trouble lately.
701911 705356 She brought this in to show the students.<br />The section on the lunar landings.
705456 710486 Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.<br />She always loved the pictures.
710586 714365 It's an old federal textbook. We've<br />replaced them with the corrected versions.
714465 715575 Corrected?
715675 720104 Explaining how the Apollo missions<br />were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
726519 728579 You don't believe we<br />went to the moon?
729605 731674 It was a brilliant<br />piece of propaganda.
731774 734677 The Soviets bankrupted themselves<br />pouring resources...
734777 738347 - into rockets and other useless machines.<br />- "Useless machines."
738447 742602 If we don't want a repeat of the excess and<br />wastefulness of the 20th century, then...
742702 746597 we need to teach our kids about this<br />planet, not tales of leaving it.
747331 751435 One of those useless machines<br />they used to make was called an MRI.
751711 754914 If we had any of those left,<br />the doctors would've been able to find...
755014 759035 the cyst in my wife's brain<br />before she died instead of afterwards.
759135 762288 Then she'd have been the one<br />listening to this instead of me...
762388 765774 which would have been a good thing,<br />because she was always...
766058 767660 the calmer one.
768227 770813 I'm sorry about your wife,<br />Mr. Cooper.
771564 775301 But Murph got into a fistfight<br />with several of her classmates over this...
775401 779764 Apollo nonsense. So we thought it best<br />to bring you in and see what ideas...
779864 782633 you might have for dealing<br />with her behavior on the home front.
783743 786854 Yeah, you know what?<br />Um, there's a game tomorrow night.
786954 789148 She's going through<br />a bit of a baseball phase.
789248 793561 Her favorite team is playing.<br />There's gonna be candy and soda and...
796547 798482 I think I'll take her to that.
803721 805272 How'd it go?
805890 807867 I got you suspended.
808184 809618 - What?<br />- Cooper.
811270 812505 This is Cooper. Go.
812605 815508 Coop, those combines you rebuilt<br />went haywire.
815608 817877 Just reset the controllers.
818110 820838 I did that.<br />Now you should come take a look.
840466 843636 One by one they've been peeling<br />off the fields and heading over.
843736 845571 Something's interfering<br />with the compass.
846972 849450 Magnetism or some such.
892468 896956 Nothing special about which book.<br />I've been working on it, like you said.
897606 900509 - I counted the spaces.<br />- Why?
902153 904538 In case the ghost<br />is trying to communicate.
905030 906874 I'm trying Morse.
907158 908642 Morse?
908742 910127 Yeah.
910244 912938 - Dots and dashes, used...<br />- I know what Morse code is, Murph.
913038 916258 I just don't think your bookshelf's<br />trying to talk to you.
927553 932032 Had to reset every compass clock and GPS<br />to offset for the anomaly.
932224 934868 - Which is?<br />- I don't know.
936562 938756 If the house was built<br />on magnetic ore...
938856 942042 we'd have seen this the first time<br />we switched on the tractor.
944612 947881 I hear your meeting at the school<br />didn't go so well.
948407 950217 Heh. You heard?
951076 954013 It's like we've forgotten<br />who we are, Donald.
955581 959484 Explorers, pioneers,<br />not caretakers.
960794 962488 When I was a kid...
962588 966817 it felt like they made something new<br />every day. Some...
967092 970487 gadget or idea.<br />Like every day was Christmas.
970846 976035 But six billion people...<br />just try to imagine that.
976936 980039 And every last one of them<br />trying to have it all.
983317 985736 This world isn't so bad.
987488 991332 And Tom will do just fine.<br />You're the one who doesn't belong.
991432 994445 Born 40 years too late,<br />or 40 years too early.
995246 998048 My daughter knew it,<br />God bless her.
998624 1001518 And your kids know it.<br />Especially Murph.
1001752 1005239 Well, we used to look up in the sky<br />and wonder...
1005339 1008016 at our place in the stars.
1010135 1014615 Now we just look down and worry<br />about our place in the dirt.
1015015 1017951 Cooper, you were<br />good at something...
1018185 1020788 and you never got a chance<br />to do anything with it.
1021480 1023115 I'm sorry.
1024625 1028754 You didn't expect this dirt<br />that was giving you this food...
1028988 1032174 to turn on you like that<br />and destroy you.
1032475 1036804 In April... I believe I'm right...<br />Fifteenth of April, I think.
1037162 1041609 This happened about 1:30 when that thing...<br />came off the top of that canyon.
1043252 1047573 In my day, we had real ballplayers.<br />Who are these bums?
1047673 1052486 In my day, people were too busy<br />fighting over food to even play baseball.
1052678 1057425 Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.<br />I want a hot dog.
1057525 1060152 School says you're gonna follow<br />in my footsteps.
1060603 1062204 I think that's great.
1062396 1065791 - You think that's great?<br />- You hate farming, Dad.
1066483 1068177 Grandpa said.
1068277 1069795 Grandpa said, huh?
1070112 1072723 Listen, all that matters<br />is how you feel about it.
1072823 1074591 I like what you do.
1075200 1076802 I like our farm.
1077369 1079063 You're gonna be great at it.
1092042 1093844 Let's get out of here.
1100601 1102703 All right, it's a doozy.
1103312 1105247 All right, gang, let's mask up.
1108484 1110586 - Tom? Murph? Check?<br />- Yeah.
1164039 1166725 Murph, Tom, you guys<br />shut your windows?
1171046 1172231 Murph?
1193527 1194920 The ghost.
1196071 1197798 Grab your pillow.
1198090 1200425 You're sleeping in with Tom.
1255155 1257024 It's not a ghost.
1261946 1263864 It's gravity.
1265516 1267868 I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town.
1268060 1272331 You want to clean that up<br />when you've finished praying to it?
1297589 1299942 It's not Morse, Murph.<br />It's binary.
1300342 1302502 Thick is one, thin is zero.
1306765 1308200 Coordinates.
1310686 1313288 Nope. Mm-mm.
1314648 1315916 Here we go.
1317401 1318877 Thirty-three.
1321738 1322881 That's it.
1324241 1325842 I can't miss this!
1326076 1329346 Grandpa will be back<br />in a couple hours, Murph.
1330038 1332808 But you don't know<br />what you're gonna find.
1333709 1335343 And that...
1336128 1338313 is why I can't take you.
1344303 1345529 Murph?
1347514 1351118 Grandpa will be home in a while.<br />Tell him I'll call him on the radio.
1357190 1358542 - Aah!<br />- Jesus.
1359443 1361428 - What are you doing?<br />- Heh-heh.
1361528 1363755 Oh, you think this is funny?<br />Huh?
1363989 1366425 You wouldn't be here<br />if it wasn't for me.
1368160 1370262 Make yourself useful.
1433517 1435251 Hey, Murph?
1436478 1438021 Murph.
1441024 1443460 I think this is the<br />end of the road.
1446363 1448507 Didn't you bring<br />the bolt cutters?
1449574 1450926 That's my girl.
1478562 1479880 Step away!
1479980 1483133 Don't shoot! I'm not armed.<br />My daughter's in the car.
1488613 1490966 - Don't be afraid.<br />- Aah!
1503587 1505772 How did you find this place?
1506381 1507816 Where's my daughter?
1508008 1511995 You had the coordinates for this facility<br />marked on your map. Where did you get them?
1512095 1513297 Where's my daughter?
1513397 1516616 Don't make me take you down again.<br />Sit down!
1516850 1519127 Oh, you still think<br />you're a Marine, pal?
1519227 1521913 Marines don't exist anymore.
1522105 1527135 - And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.<br />- Where did you find those coordinates?
1527235 1529888 But you don't look much<br />like a lawnmower.
1529988 1532891 Think I'll turn you<br />into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.
1532991 1534301 No, you won't.
1535827 1537846 TARS, back down, please.
1539247 1542475 You know, you're taking a risk<br />using ex-military security.
1542834 1546738 They're old, and their control units<br />are unpredictable.
1546838 1548907 It's what the<br />government could spare.
1550509 1551776 Who are you?
1552135 1553537 Dr. Brand.
1553637 1556114 I knew a Dr. Brand once.<br />He was a professor.
1556389 1557991 What makes you think I'm not?
1558350 1560919 Wasn't near as cute, either.
1561019 1563622 Please, Dr. Brand.<br />I don't have any idea what this is.
1564356 1566925 Now I'm scared for my daughter<br />and want her by my side.
1567025 1569586 You give me that,<br />I'll tell you anything you want to know.
1572864 1575967 Get the principals and the girl<br />in the conference room, please.
1577402 1580180 Your daughter is fine.<br />Bright kid.
1580664 1582566 Must have a very smart mother.
1582666 1585152 It's pretty clear<br />you don't want any visitors.
1585252 1589314 So why don't you just let us back up from<br />your fence and we'll be on our way? Huh?
1589506 1592150 - It's not that simple.<br />- Well, sure, it is.
1592384 1596154 I don't know anything about you.<br />I don't know anything about this place.
1596930 1598198 Yes, you do.
1603812 1604996 Dad!
1607566 1608708 Hello, Cooper.
1610068 1611211 Professor Brand.
1612579 1615307 Explain to me how<br />you found this facility.
1615407 1618769 Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled<br />upon it. We were on a salvage run...
1618869 1621646 You're sitting in the best-kept secret<br />in the world.
1621746 1625350 Nobody stumbles in here.<br />Nobody stumbles out.
1625584 1629863 Cooper, please.<br />Cooperate with these people.
1629963 1631273 Look.
1632090 1633858 It's kind of hard to explain.
1634092 1638914 We learned these coordinates<br />from an anomaly.
1639014 1640415 What sort of anomaly?
1640515 1643877 I hesitate to term it supernatural,<br />but it definitely wasn't scientific.
1643977 1647964 You're going to have to be specific,<br />Mr. Cooper. Right now.
1648064 1649416 It was gravity.
1654290 1657265 Um, what sort of gravitational anomaly?<br />Where was this?
1657365 1660727 Now, I'm real happy that you're excited<br />about gravity, bud...
1660827 1663706 but you're not getting any answers<br />from us until I get assurances.
1663806 1665598 - Assurances?<br />- Yeah.
1666333 1669861 Like, that we're getting out of here.<br />And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.
1672339 1675951 - Don't you know who we are, Coop?<br />- No, professor, I don't.
1676051 1678153 You know my father, Professor Brand.
1678678 1680071 We're NASA.
1681765 1684075 - NASA?<br />- NASA.
1684309 1686202 The same NASA you flew for.
1697155 1698890 I heard they shut you down, sir...
1698990 1703061 for refusing to drop bombs<br />from the stratosphere onto starving people.
1703161 1705564 When they realized<br />that killing other people was...
1705664 1708567 not a long-term solution,<br />then they needed us back.
1708667 1710735 - In secret.<br />- Why secret?
1710835 1714831 Because public opinion wouldn't<br />allow spending on space exploration.
1714931 1717525 Not while you're struggling<br />to put food on the table.
1718843 1720111 Blight.
1720470 1724707 Wheat seven years ago.<br />Okra this year.
1725058 1726826 Now there's just corn.
1727060 1729087 And we're growing more<br />than we ever have.
1729187 1733458 But like the potatoes in Ireland<br />and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...
1733942 1736544 the corn will die.
1737195 1738338 Soon.
1743535 1747222 We'll find a way, professor.<br />We always have.
1747872 1751976 Driven by the unshakable faith<br />the Earth is ours.
1752377 1756481 Not just ours, no.<br />But it is our home.
1757716 1762996 Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.<br />We don't even breathe nitrogen.
1763096 1768501 Blight does. And as it thrives,<br />our air gets less and less oxygen.
1768601 1772130 The last people to starve<br />will be the first to suffocate.
1772230 1774499 And your daughter's<br />generation...
1775967 1778386 will be the last to<br />survive on Earth.
1778486 1779787 Murph is feeling tired.
1779812 1782197 I was wondering if she could<br />take a nap in my office.
1782574 1784175 Yeah. Thank you.
1786870 1788312 Alright...
1788913 1792517 now you need to tell me<br />what your plan is to save the world.
1793084 1796688 We're not meant to save the world.<br />We're meant to leave it.
1802427 1803570 Rangers.
1803762 1808825 The last components of our one versatile<br />ship in orbit, the Endurance.
1809017 1810743 Our final expedition.
1811436 1814497 You sent people out there<br />looking for a new home?
1815023 1816416 The Lazarus missions.
1816649 1819711 - Oh, that sounds cheerful.<br />- Lazarus came back from the dead.
1819944 1822046 Sure, but he had to die<br />in the first place.
1822572 1825350 There's not a planet in our solar system<br />that could sustain life...
1825450 1828019 and the nearest star's<br />over a thousand years away.
1828119 1830889 That doesn't even<br />qualify as futile.
1832457 1833892 Where'd you send them?
1834209 1835694 Cooper...
1835794 1840657 I can't tell you anymore<br />unless you agree to pilot this craft.
1840757 1844152 - You're the best pilot we ever had.<br />- I barely left the stratosphere.
1844344 1846571 This team never<br />left the simulator.
1846805 1850667 We need a pilot, and this is the mission<br />that you were trained for.
1850767 1852368 Without even knowing it?
1853311 1857632 An hour ago, you didn't even know<br />I was alive. You were going anyway.
1857732 1861461 We had no choice.<br />But something sent you here.
1861694 1864506 - They chose you.<br />- Who's "they"?
1872372 1874390 How long would I be gone?
1874874 1878094 Hard to know. Years?
1878503 1882774 - I've got kids, professor.<br />- Get out there and save them.
1886052 1887495 Who's "they"?
1887595 1891624 We started detecting gravitational<br />anomalies almost 50 years ago.
1891724 1895420 Mostly small distortions to our instruments<br />in the upper atmosphere.
1895520 1898748 In fact, I believe<br />you encountered one yourself.
1899315 1901817 Yeah, over the Straights.
1902318 1905430 My crash.<br />Something tripped my fly-by-wire.
1905530 1906839 Exactly.
1907574 1912562 But of all these anomalies,<br />the most significant is this,
1912662 1914731 Out near Saturn...
1914831 1917016 a disturbance of space-time.
1919043 1922272 - Is that a Wormhole?<br />- It appeared 48 years ago.
1922630 1926818 - And it leads where?<br />- Another galaxy.
1928470 1930789 A wormhole's not<br />a naturally occurring phenomenon.
1930889 1932407 Someone placed it there.
1933099 1934701 - "They"?<br />- Mm.
1935101 1939289 And whoever they are,<br />they appear to be looking out for us.
1939647 1944386 That Wormhole lets us travel to other<br />stars. It came along right as we needed it.
1944486 1947472 They've put potentially habitable worlds<br />right within our reach.
1947572 1949557 Twelve, in fact,<br />from our initial probes.
1949657 1952102 - You sent probes into that?<br />- Mm-hm.
1952202 1955605 We sent people into it.<br />Ten years ago.
1956539 1958441 The Lazarus missions.
1958541 1962353 Twelve possible worlds,<br />twelve Ranger launches carrying...
1962712 1968226 the bravest humans ever to live...<br />led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.
1968326 1971496 Each person's landing pod<br />had enough life support for two years.
1971596 1973623 But they could use hibernation<br />to stretch that...
1973723 1977001 making observations on organics<br />over a decade or more.
1977101 1981039 Their mission was to assess their world,<br />and if it showed potential...
1981272 1985760 then they could send out a signal, bed down<br />for the long nap, wait to be rescued.
1985860 1988004 And what if the world<br />didn't show promise?
1988530 1990048 Hence the bravery.
1990740 1993351 You don't have the resources<br />to visit all 12.
1993451 1994877 No.
1995453 1998314 Data transmission back through<br />the Wormhole is rudimentary.
1998414 2003528 Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us<br />some clue as to which worlds have potential.
2003628 2005521 And one system shows promise.
2005755 2008699 One. That's a bit<br />of a long shot, isn't it?
2009133 2012070 One system with three<br />potential worlds?
2012387 2014372 No long shot.
2016140 2017367 Okay.
2017976 2020611 So if we find a home...
2022981 2026542 - ...then what?<br />- That's the long shot.
2026776 2030088 There's a Plan A and a Plan B.
2030488 2033549 Did you notice anything strange<br />about the launch chamber?
2045169 2048189 This entire facility's a centrifuge.
2048423 2051025 Some kind of vehicle.<br />A space station?
2051259 2055330 - Both. Plan A.<br />- How do you get it off the ground?
2055430 2059334 The first gravitational anomalies<br />changed everything.
2059434 2063971 Suddenly we knew<br />that harnessing gravity was real.
2064105 2068876 So I started working on a theory<br />and we started building this station.
2069152 2071537 But you haven't solved it yet.
2072322 2073965 That's why there's Plan B.
2074365 2079145 The problem is gravity. How to get a viable<br />amount of human life off the planet.
2079245 2080638 This is one way.
2080872 2083474 Plan B, A population bomb.
2083708 2088563 Over 5,000 fertilized eggs<br />weighing in at just under 900 kilos.
2089172 2090740 How would you raise them?
2090840 2093368 With equipment on board,<br />we incubate the first 10.
2093468 2097447 After that, with surrogacy,<br />the growth becomes exponential.
2098056 2101417 Within 30 years,<br />we could have a colony of hundreds.
2101517 2104996 The real difficulty with colonization<br />is genetic diversity.
2105521 2107131 This takes care of that.
2107231 2109792 But what about the people here?<br />You just...
2110068 2113579 You give up on them? My kids?
2113821 2117258 That's why Plan A<br />is a lot more fun.
2119410 2122355 - How far have you got?<br />- Almost there.
2122455 2124974 You're asking me to<br />hang everything...
2125917 2127351 on an almost.
2127794 2130188 I'm asking you to trust me.
2133174 2134942 Find us a new home.
2135593 2137695 And by the time you return...
2138179 2140948 I will have solved<br />the problem of gravity.
2141808 2143493 I give you my word.
2156030 2157632 Go away!
2168209 2169527 Murph.
2169627 2172730 Go! If you're leaving, just go.
2175425 2178461 This world was never<br />enough for you, was it, Coop?
2179095 2183349 What, because heading out there<br />is what I feel like I was born to do?
2183808 2185743 And it excites me? Heh.
2186352 2188880 No, that does not make it wrong.
2188980 2193709 It might. Don't trust the right thing<br />done for the wrong reason.
2194360 2196763 The why of the thing,<br />that's the foundation.
2196863 2199248 And the foundation's solid.
2202118 2207223 We farmers, we sit here every year<br />when the rains fail and we say,
2207415 2208766 "Next year."
2209333 2213104 Well, next year ain't gonna save us,<br />nor the one after that.
2213338 2218067 This world's a treasure, Donald, but it's<br />been telling us to leave for a while now.
2222680 2226576 Mankind was born on Earth,<br />it was never meant to die here.
2229604 2232882 Tom will be all right, but you got<br />to make things right with Murph.
2232982 2234625 I will.
2234984 2238254 Without making promises<br />you don't know you can keep.
2248790 2250892 You have to talk to me, Murph.
2253294 2255488 I need to fix this before I go.
2255588 2258566 Then I'll keep it<br />broken so you have to stay.
2260051 2265156 After you kids came along, your mom said<br />something to me I never quite understood.
2265431 2267558 She said, "Now..."
2268935 2273539 "we're just here<br />to be memories for our kids."
2278569 2281172 And I think that now I understand<br />what she meant.
2284826 2288679 Once you're a parent,<br />you're the ghost of your children's future.
2290206 2292475 You said ghosts didn't exist.
2298840 2300441 That's right, Murph.
2303553 2305387 Murph, look at me.
2307932 2310534 I can't be your ghost right now.
2312228 2314530 I need to exist.
2315857 2317875 They chose me.
2318484 2322546 Murph, they chose me. You saw.<br />You're the one who led me to them.
2325074 2327677 That's exactly why you can't go.
2330788 2332848 I figured out the message.
2333165 2336444 - One word. Know what it is?<br />- Murph.
2336544 2337979 "Stay."
2338254 2341232 - It says, "Stay," Dad.<br />- Murph.
2342091 2343618 You don't believe me.
2343718 2346579 Look at the books! Look at this.<br />It says, "Stay."
2346679 2349740 Why...? You're not listening!<br />It says, "Stay!"
2349974 2353711 - No, I'm coming back.<br />- When?
2366324 2369060 One for you, one for me.
2369160 2372430 When I'm up there in<br />hypersleep, or...
2372663 2376007 traveling near the<br />speed of light, or...
2376208 2378694 near a black hole...
2378794 2383641 time's gonna change for me.<br />It's gonna run more slowly.
2384926 2387319 When we get back...
2387845 2389330 we're gonna compare.
2389430 2392358 - Time will run differently for us?<br />- Yeah.
2393142 2397913 By the time I get back,<br />we might even be the same age, you and me.
2398189 2401524 "What?" Imagine that!
2405071 2406305 Aw, Murph...
2406405 2409433 You have no idea when<br />you're coming back.
2410826 2412972 No idea at all!
2415456 2417650 Murph, don't...<br />Don't make me leave like this.
2417750 2419351 Come on, Murph!
2419752 2422488 Don't make me leave<br />like this, Murph!
2429679 2430821 Hey...
2431263 2435251 I love you. Forever.<br />You hear me?
2435351 2438862 I love you forever,<br />and I'm coming back.
2444360 2445995 I'm coming back.
2463921 2466490 - How'd it go?<br />- Fine.
2466841 2468400 Just fine.
2474765 2475991 I love you, Tom.
2476434 2478628 - Travel safe, huh?<br />- Yeah.
2478728 2481047 You look after our place<br />for me, all right?
2481147 2482873 - All right?<br />- Uh-huh.
2487478 2491156 - Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?<br />- You mean your truck?
2492158 2494084 I'll make sure they<br />bring it back.
2495911 2498005 Look after my kids, Donald!
2510176 2513904 Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...
2514872 2516624 - Dad!<br />- ...nine...
2516724 2518075 Dad!
2518801 2520445 ...eight...
2521178 2523781 - seven...<br />- Dad!
2524014 2525357 ...six...
2526533 2529253 five, main engine start, four...
2530688 2531955 three...
2532523 2533749 two...
2534566 2536752 one. Booster ignition and...
2545920 2548480 All engines look good.<br />Beginning roll program.
2552676 2555613 Prepare for stage<br />one separation.
2555846 2556989 Stage one.
2562853 2564788 There is Mach 1.
2565648 2569460 Everybody good?<br />Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?
2571237 2574632 They gave him a humor setting<br />so he'd fit in better with his unit.
2574865 2576600 He thinks it relaxes us.
2576700 2579595 A giant sarcastic robot.
2580371 2581856 What a great idea!
2581956 2584734 I have a cue light I can use<br />when I'm joking if you like.
2584834 2585943 That'd probably help.
2586043 2590064 You can use it to find your way back to the<br />ship after I blow you out the airlock.
2591048 2594118 - What's your humor setting, TARS?<br />- That's 100 percent.
2594218 2596111 Let's bring it on down to 75, please.
2596345 2598280 Stage two separation.
2608858 2611218 All feeds going manual.
2611318 2613236 Going manual.
2615030 2617266 Deactivate probe heater one,<br />two and three.
2617366 2618509 Check.
2623998 2627017 - Taking control.<br />- This is handover to you.
2630754 2633148 - A.D.F. check.<br />- Over.
2633382 2637119 Pull thrusters back.<br />Fuel cells one, two, three.
2637219 2640656 - One hundred percent.<br />- Ex-mites.
2649523 2654336 It's hard leaving everything.<br />My kids. Your father.
2654862 2657306 We're going to be spending<br />a lot of time together.
2657406 2660551 - We should learn to talk.<br />- And when not to.
2662745 2664355 Just being honest.
2664455 2666890 I don't think you need<br />to be that honest.
2667208 2669693 Hey, TARS, what's your<br />honesty parameter?
2669793 2672488 - Ninety percent.<br />- Ninety percent?
2672588 2675286 Absolute honesty isn't always<br />the most diplomatic,
2675386 2678452 nor the safest form of communication<br />with emotional beings.
2678552 2680112 Okay.
2680471 2683198 Ninety percent it is,<br />Dr. Brand.
2686810 2690122 We are coming up on the Endurance.<br />Twelve minutes out.
2707122 2709224 Okay. Taking control.
2712586 2715564 Approaching module<br />port, 500 meters.
2728477 2729703 It's all you, Doyle.
2748163 2750724 Nice and easy, Doyle.<br />Nice and easy.
2755796 2758449 - I feel good.<br />- Take us home.
2766181 2768484 - Lock.<br />- Target locked.
2768584 2770586 - Well done.<br />- Okay, helmets on.
2770686 2771829 Good job.
2805179 2808699 Door's not charging. Never mind.
2831372 2833182 Cooper, you should have control.
2833415 2835017 Control here.
2836335 2839062 Communication with<br />ring module active.
2845427 2847070 Oh, wow.
2852768 2854036 That's initiate.
2861485 2864087 - Are we ready to spin?<br />- Just a sec.
2875416 2877851 - Hello, CASE.<br />- Hello, TARS.
2878710 2880729 All right, we're all set.
2881088 2882689 All right, let's do it.
2900899 2902501 Heh.
2911743 2913136 Thirty percent of spin.
2919960 2921395 One G.
2922045 2924147 How's gravity treating<br />you back there?
2924381 2926049 Well.
2928719 2930579 Romilly? Hey, you okay?
2930679 2931789 - Yeah.<br />- You all right?
2931889 2934074 Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.
2934391 2937683 I think we have some Dramamine<br />in the hab pod, I'm just gonna get that
2937783 2939643 or maybe in the cryo-beds.<br />I'll just be a sec.
2939743 2941498 - Hey, Brand?<br />- Yeah?
2941732 2943359 - Bring a lot.<br />- Heh-heh-heh.
2952034 2955012 Amelia, be safe.
2955245 2958816 - Give my regards to Dr. Mann.<br />- I will, Dad.
2958916 2964438 It looks good for your trajectory.<br />We've calculated two years to Saturn.
2964888 2966690 That's a lot of Dramamine.
2967299 2969860 Look after my family,<br />will you, please, sir?
2970302 2973396 We'll be waiting for you<br />when you get back.
2973597 2977534 A little older, a little wiser,<br />but happy to see you.
2980270 2983707 <i>Do not go gentle into that good night.</i>
2984074 2988420 <i>Old age should burn<br />and rave at close of day.</i>
2989488 2994551 <i>Rage, rage against<br />the dying of the light.</i>
2995327 2999222 <i>Though wise men at their end<br />Know dark is right.</i>
2999456 3002434 <i>Because their words had forked<br />No lightning they.</i>
3002751 3006396 <i>Do not go gentle<br />into that good night.</i>
3006964 3011601 <i>Rage, rage against<br />the dying of the light.</i>
3027901 3029670 - You good?<br />- Yeah.
3030487 3032089 Okay, thank you, sir.
3035492 3037127 Here. Pills.
3039580 3041298 So alone.
3041498 3043525 We have each other.<br />Dr. Mann had it worse.
3043625 3045068 No, I mean them.
3045168 3046361 Hm?
3046461 3049856 It's a perfect planet,<br />and we won't find another one like her.
3050340 3053694 No, it's not like looking<br />for a new condo.
3054720 3056988 The human race is going to be...
3057189 3058499 adrift...
3058599 3062202 desperate for a rock it can cling to<br />while it catches its breath.
3062686 3064621 We need to find that rock.
3064855 3069710 And our three prospects are at the edge<br />of what might sustain human life.
3070110 3072638 Laura Miller's planet is first.
3072738 3074965 - Laura started our biology program.<br />- Mm-hm.
3079870 3083140 - Uh, Wolf Edmunds is here.<br />- Tell me about Edmunds.
3083874 3086927 Oh, uh... Wolf's a<br />particle physicist.
3088920 3091356 None of them had families, huh?
3092299 3095244 No. No attachments.<br />My father insisted.
3095344 3098956 They all knew the odds against<br />ever seeing another human being again.
3099056 3101083 I'm hoping we can surprise<br />at least three of them.
3101183 3103168 - How about Mann?<br />- Dr. Mann?
3103268 3105254 He's remarkable.<br />He's the best of us.
3105354 3109800 He inspired 11 people to follow him<br />on the loneliest journey in human history.
3109900 3111552 Scientists, explorers.
3111652 3115839 That's what I love.<br />You know, out there we face great odds.
3116239 3117958 Death, but...
3119409 3120844 not evil.
3121036 3122888 You don't think<br />nature can be evil?
3123163 3126132 No. Formidable. Frightening.<br />But...
3126625 3128727 - ...no, not evil.<br />- Hm.
3129878 3133190 Is a lion evil<br />because it rips a gazelle to shreds?
3133590 3135992 Just what we take with us, then.
3136134 3137477 Yeah.
3137594 3139746 This crew represents<br />the best of humanity.
3139846 3141081 Even me, huh?
3141181 3143250 You know what?<br />We agreed, 90 percent.
3143350 3144751 There you go.
3144851 3147296 - Don't stay up.<br />- I'll be there in a minute.
3147396 3151541 Just remember, Coop,<br />you are literally wasting your breath.
3158115 3161384 Hey, TARS? Let's go over<br />that trajectory one more time.
3161618 3163386 Eight months to Mars.
3163787 3166690 Counter-orbital slingshot around.<br />Fourteen months to Saturn.
3166790 3168275 Nothing's changed on that.
3168375 3170560 Just let me ask you something.
3172713 3176274 - Dr. Brand and Edmunds...<br />- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.
3177634 3180704 Dr. Brand and Edmunds.<br />They close?
3180804 3182289 I wouldn't know.
3182389 3185359 Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"<br />or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?
3185459 3188288 - I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.<br />- Aah.
3190147 3192415 But not a poker face, Slick.
3204661 3206212 Hey, guys.
3206329 3209516 Uh, Dad's about to go down<br />for the long nap.
3209750 3212444 So I wanted to give<br />you an update.
3212544 3213770 Uh...
3214212 3217465 The Earth looks amazing from here.<br />Um...
3218467 3221370 You can't see any of the dust.<br />Heh.
3222703 3225699 I really hope you<br />guys are doing great.
3225932 3228641 I know you're gonna get this message.<br />Professor Brand's assured me that...
3228741 3230200 he's gonna get it to you.
3230729 3232873 Know that I love you.
3234191 3236626 - Is it him?<br />- I don't think so, Murph.
3243408 3245176 You must be Donald.
3247287 3248555 Hello, Murph.
3249206 3251308 Why are you in my dad's truck?
3251833 3254102 He wanted me<br />to bring it for your brother.
3254753 3257022 He sent you a message.
3260008 3262077 She's pretty upset<br />with him for leaving.
3262177 3266364 If you record any messages,<br />I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.
3267349 3270118 Murph is a bright spark.
3271019 3273630 Maybe I should fan the flame.
3273730 3276383 She's already making fools<br />of her teachers.
3276483 3279619 So maybe she should come<br />and make a fool out of you.
3280403 3283540 - So where are they?<br />- Heading for Mars.
3283949 3287953 The next time you hear from Cooper,<br />they'll be coming up on Saturn.
3328848 3333056 ...administration wants<br />me to repeat Plant Pathology. Which sucks.
3333456 3336768 But they said I could start<br />Advanced Agriculture a year early.
3338461 3342440 All right, I got to go, Dad.<br />Hope you're safe up there.
3346386 3348038 Um, sorry, Coop.
3348138 3353076 I asked Murph to say hi,<br />but she's as stubborn as her old man.
3353393 3355328 I'll try again next time.
3370243 3371895 You all right, Rom?
3374164 3377934 This gets to me, Cooper.<br />This. This.
3378335 3381279 Millimeters of aluminum, that's it,<br />and then nothing...
3381379 3385442 out there for millions of miles<br />won't kill us in seconds.
3386259 3388245 You know that some<br />of the finest...
3388345 3392282 solo yachtsmen in the world<br />don't know how to swim?
3392766 3396036 They don't know how. And if they<br />go overboard, psst, they're done.
3397687 3399748 We're explorers, Rom.
3401191 3404594 This is our boat. Here.
3431304 3433123 This is from the, uh... relay probe?
3433223 3435366 It was in orbit<br />around the Wormhole.
3435767 3438879 This is the Wormhole,<br />and every time we'd come around...
3438979 3442290 we would receive images<br />from the other side of the foreign galaxy.
3442524 3444718 Oh, yeah.<br />Like swinging a periscope around.
3444818 3445969 Exactly.
3446069 3450673 So we got a pretty good idea what we're<br />gonna find on the other side, huh?
3451658 3453093 Navigationally.
3454452 3458506 Guys? Looks like we'll be approaching<br />the Wormhole in about three hours.
3464587 3465930 Hey, Coop?
3466506 3469576 - Can we stop the spinning?<br />- Why?
3469676 3472312 Because we're close enough<br />to see it now?
3473847 3475040 All right.
3475140 3476324 Thanks.
3481980 3484007 There, that's it!<br />That's the Wormhole!
3484107 3487636 Say it, don't spray it, Rom.<br />It's a sphere.
3487736 3491998 Of course it is. What, you...?<br />You thought it would just be a hole?
3492907 3496094 No, it's just that all the illustrations<br />I've ever seen, they...
3496536 3499722 In the illustrations,<br />they're trying to show you how it works.
3500331 3504402 So they say you want to go<br />from here to there.
3504502 3506826 - But it's too far, right?<br />- Mm-hm.
3507213 3512110 So a Wormhole bends space like this,<br />so you can take a shortcut through...
3512343 3513995 a higher dimension.
3514095 3515655 Okay, so...
3515889 3518826 to show that,<br />they've turned three-dimensional space
3518926 3524005 into two dimensions which turns a Wormhole<br />into two dimensions, a circle.
3524105 3526657 What's a circle in<br />three dimensions?
3527567 3529169 - A sphere.<br />- Exactly.
3529486 3531087 A spherical hole.
3531529 3534465 But who put it there?<br />Who do we have to thank?
3534783 3539554 I'm not thanking anybody until we<br />get out of here in one piece, Rom.
3546469 3548488 Any trick to this, Doyle?
3549422 3551191 No one knows.
3558223 3559991 The others made it, right?
3561935 3563703 At least some of them.
3595552 3598821 Everybody ready to say goodbye<br />to our solar system?
3599597 3601699 To our galaxy.
3603518 3604661 Here we go.
3637177 3640747 The controls won't work here.<br />We're passing through the bulk.
3640847 3645368 It's space beyond our three dimensions.<br />All you can do is record and observe.
3656446 3657588 What is that?
3659866 3663970 - I think it's them.<br />- Distorting space-time.
3665955 3667140 Don't! Don't!
3695068 3696619 What was that?
3699322 3700923 The first handshake.
3702492 3703934 We're...
3705161 3706796 We're here.
3726849 3729169 So the lost communications came through.
3729269 3732213 - How?<br />- The relay on this side cached them.
3732313 3735958 So years of basic data.<br />No real surprises.
3736776 3740480 Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,<br />as has Dr. Mann's. Um...
3740580 3742974 Edmunds' went down<br />three years ago.
3743074 3744350 Transmitter failure?
3744450 3747520 Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up<br />right until it went dark.
3747620 3749439 But Miller's still<br />looks good though, right?
3749539 3751933 - Because she's coming up fast.<br />- Mm-hm.
3752292 3754394 With one complication.
3754711 3757780 The planet is much closer to Gargantua<br />than we thought.
3757880 3760617 - Gargantua?<br />- It's what we're calling the black hole.
3760717 3763077 Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets<br />both orbit it.
3763177 3766456 - And Miller's is on the horizon?<br />- As a basketball around a hoop.
3766556 3768625 Landing there takes us<br />dangerously close.
3768725 3772078 And a black hole that big<br />has a huge gravitational pull.
3774564 3777634 Look, I could swing around<br />that neutron star to decelerate.
3777734 3779477 No, it's not that. It's time.
3779577 3784382 The gravity on that planet will slow<br />our clock compared to Earth's drastically.
3784907 3786142 How bad?
3786242 3789887 Every hour we spend<br />on that planet will be...
3790663 3792932 seven years back on Earth.
3793708 3794851 Jesus.
3795084 3796853 Well, that's relativity, folks.
3798171 3800698 Well, we can't just drop down<br />there without...
3800798 3802742 Cooper, we have a mission.
3802842 3805495 Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,<br />and our mission Plan A is...
3805595 3808831 to find a planet that can habitate the<br />people that are living on Earth right now.
3808931 3811834 You can't just think about your family.<br />Now you have to think bigger than that.
3811934 3815013 I am thinking about my family<br />and millions of other families, okay?
3815113 3819667 Plan A does not work if the people on Earth<br />are dead by the time we pull it off.
3820760 3824630 No. It doesn't.<br />That's why there's a Plan B.
3826449 3829492 Okay. Cooper's right.<br />We need to think of time as a resource,
3829592 3832054 just like oxygen and food.<br />Going down it's gonna cost us.
3834332 3836000 All right, look.
3836793 3840321 Dr. Mann's data is promising,<br />but it's gonna take months to get there.
3840421 3842699 And Edmunds', it's even further.
3842799 3847036 Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has is<br />very promising. It's water, it's organics...
3847136 3849372 - You don't find that every day.<br />- No, you don't.
3849472 3851874 And just think about the resources,<br />including time...
3851974 3854577 that would be spent<br />trying to get back here.
3855603 3857063 - Romilly...<br />- Yeah?
3857163 3861467 ...how far off from Miller's planet do we<br />have to be to stay out of the time shift?
3861567 3863303 Just back from the cusp.
3863403 3866431 All right, which is here,<br />just outside of Miller's planet.
3866531 3868424 - Right.<br />- Okay.
3869242 3872103 Here's Gargantua.<br />Here's Miller's planet.
3872203 3875440 Instead of taking the Endurance<br />into orbit around Miller's planet...
3875540 3878484 which would conserve fuel,<br />but we would lose a lot of time...
3878584 3881752 what if we take a wider orbit<br />around Gargantua,
3881852 3885408 parallel with Miller's planet<br />outside of this time shift, to here?
3885508 3888369 Then we take the Ranger down,<br />we get Miller, we get her samples.
3888469 3891247 We come back, we analyze, we debrief.<br />We're in, we're out.
3891347 3893750 We lose a little fuel,<br />but we save a whole lot of time.
3893850 3895552 - That'll work.<br />- That's good.
3895652 3898179 There's no time for monkey business<br />or chit-chat down there.
3898279 3901141 So, TARS,<br />you should definitely stay here.
3901241 3903760 CASE, you're with me.<br />Anyone else can stay.
3903860 3907978 If we're talking about a couple years,<br />I could use the time to research gravity.
3908078 3910641 Observations from the Wormhole,<br />that's gold to Professor Brand.
3910741 3912477 TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.
3912577 3917398 Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting, but make<br />sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.
3917498 3920109 - You got it?<br />- I wouldn't leave you behind...
3920209 3921352 Dr. Brand.
3925923 3927650 - You ready, CASE?<br />- Yup.
3928509 3932113 - You don't say much, do you?<br />- TARS talks plenty for both of us.
3933222 3934365 Detach.
3941564 3944625 - Romilly, are you reading these forces?<br />- It's unbelievable.
3947737 3950264 A literal heart of darkness.
3954035 3956813 If we could just see<br />the collapsed star inside...
3956913 3959765 the singularity, yeah,<br />we'd solve gravity.
3960082 3963444 - And we can't get anything from it?<br />- Nothing escapes that horizon.
3963544 3964946 Not even light.
3965046 3968649 - The answer's there, just no way to see it.<br />- There's Miller's planet.
3971219 3973253 Goodbye, Ranger.
3985358 3987718 This is fast for atmospheric entry.
3987818 3990171 - Should we use the thrusters to slow?<br />- No.
3990530 3993933 I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics<br />to save some fuel.
3994033 3995309 Air brake?
3995409 3999021 - We want to get down fast, don't we?<br />- We want to get there in one piece.
3999121 4002224 - Hang on.<br />- Brand, Doyle, get ready.
4017974 4020543 - We should ease!<br />- Hands where I can see them.
4020643 4024046 The only time I went down was when a<br />machine was easing at the wrong time.
4024146 4027049 - A little caution...<br />- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.
4027149 4029418 - Cooper, it's too damn fast!<br />- I got this.
4034156 4038260 - Should I disable the feedback?<br />- No. I need to feel the air.
4042364 4043632 Here we go.
4046627 4048020 It's just water!
4049422 4051023 The stuff of life.
4051382 4052867 Twelve hundred meters.
4052967 4055077 - Do we have a fix on the beacon?<br />- Got it!
4055177 4057872 - Can you maneuver?<br />- I'll need to shave some speed.
4057972 4060700 I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.<br />Everybody hang on!
4063019 4064161 Seven hundred.
4066188 4068290 On my cue, CASE.<br />On my cue.
4071694 4073295 Five hundred meters.
4082663 4083806 Fire!
4097261 4099697 - Very graceful.<br />- No.
4100222 4103408 But very efficient.
4104769 4107046 What are you waiting for?<br />Let's go!
4107146 4109165 Go, go, go!
4109282 4112835 Seven years per hour here.<br />Let's make it count!
4138844 4140196 This way.
4142932 4144784 About 200 meters.
4154193 4156320 The gravity's punishing.
4156779 4158973 Been floating through<br />space too long?
4159073 4161350 110% Earth gravity.
4161450 4163752 Come on. Come on.
4166080 4169016 - There's nothing here.<br />- Should be right here.
4170835 4174138 If the signal's<br />coming from here, then...
4183472 4185140 Her beacon.
4192773 4193916 Wreckage.
4194483 4195751 Where's the rest?
4196152 4197753 Towards the mountains!
4201490 4203425 Those aren't mountains.
4204994 4206428 They're waves.
4211667 4214436 Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
4214837 4216939 That one's moving away from us.
4223345 4225114 We need the recorder.
4235191 4237510 Brand, Doyle, back<br />to the Ranger now!
4237610 4241055 We're not leaving<br />without her data.
4241155 4244433 Get back here now!<br />We do not have time!
4244533 4247094 The second wave is coming!<br />We're in the middle of a swell.
4248287 4249772 No, I got it.
4249872 4251974 Get your ass back<br />to the Ranger now!
4256879 4259023 Brand, get back here now!
4260883 4263193 No, Cooper, go.<br />Cooper, go. I can't make it.
4263511 4265988 - Go!<br />- CASE, go get her.
4270684 4272786 - Go!<br />- Get up. Get up, Brand!
4273604 4275205 Go, go! Go!
4276690 4279627 - I'm not gonna make it!<br />- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!
4286367 4288761 Come on, CASE has her!<br />Get back here, Doyle!
4291664 4293048 Come on!
4295501 4297019 Get to the hatch!
4301465 4303067 Go, go! Go!
4308514 4309698 Shit.
4310099 4312034 Manually overriding<br />inside hatch!
4315437 4316705 Cooper! Wait!
4323946 4327716 The engines are flooded!<br />I'm gonna have to shut her down.
4361066 4362501 Holy shit.
4366822 4368257 Hang on!
4399396 4403333 - CASE, what's the problem?<br />- Too waterlogged. Let it drain.
4404360 4405636 Goddamn it!
4405736 4410474 - I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?<br />- And I told you to get your ass back here!
4410574 4415345 - One of us was thinking about the mission!<br />- You were thinking about getting home.
4417081 4419483 I was trying to do<br />the right thing!
4419583 4421643 Can you tell that to Doyle?
4423637 4426106 - CASE, how much time?<br />- Forty-five to an hour.
4427800 4431588 The stuff of life, huh?<br />What's this gonna cost us, Brand?
4432388 4434415 A lot. Decades.
4441563 4442998 What happened to Miller?
4443649 4449263 Judging by the wreckage, she was<br />broken up by a wave soon after impact.
4449363 4452299 How's the wreckage stayed together<br />after all these years, huh?
4453450 4455752 Because of the time slippage.
4456578 4461183 On this planet's time,<br />she just landed hours ago.
4462001 4464445 She probably just<br />died minutes ago.
4464545 4468690 The data Doyle received was just<br />the initial status echoing endlessly.
4468966 4471235 Oh, we are not<br />prepared for this.
4473512 4477041 You eggheads have the survival skills<br />of a Boy Scout troop.
4477141 4480461 Well, we got this far on our brains.<br />Farther than any human in history.
4480561 4482379 Well, not far enough!
4482479 4486083 And now we're stuck here till there<br />won't be anyone left on Earth to save.
4489028 4491797 I'm counting every minute,<br />same as you, Cooper.
4496493 4498395 Is there any possibility...
4498495 4502191 I don't know, some kind of a way<br />we can maybe all jump in a black hole?
4502291 4504059 Gain back the years?
4504626 4506195 Don't shake your head at me.
4506295 4508364 Time is relative, okay?
4508464 4511608 It can stretch<br />and it can squeeze, but...
4512009 4514286 it can't run backwards.<br />It just can't.
4514386 4518907 The only thing that can move across<br />dimensions, like time, is gravity.
4521518 4522986 Okay.
4524646 4528592 The beings that led us here,<br />they communicate...
4528692 4530594 - ...through gravity, right?<br />- Yes.
4530694 4532963 Could they be talking to us<br />from the future?
4533781 4536133 - Maybe.<br />- Okay. If they can...
4537242 4540596 "They" are beings<br />of five dimensions.
4540913 4544349 To them, time might be<br />another physical dimension.
4544583 4546018 To them...
4546335 4550572 the past might be a canyon<br />that they can climb into and the future...
4550672 4553775 a mountain they can climb up.<br />But to us, it's not, okay?
4554760 4558279 Look, Cooper, I screwed up.<br />I'm sorry.
4559348 4562701 - But you knew about relativity.<br />- Oh.
4564311 4565979 Brand...
4570359 4572578 my daughter was 10 years old.
4572903 4575797 I couldn't teach her<br />Einstein's theories before I left.
4576115 4579051 Couldn't you have told her<br />you were going to save the world?
4579535 4581077 No.
4582246 4586716 When you become a parent,<br />one thing becomes really clear.
4587918 4591188 And that is that you want to make sure<br />your children feel safe.
4592131 4596284 And it rules out telling a 10-year-old<br />that the world is ending.
4598245 4599821 Cooper?
4603433 4606003 - How long for the engines, CASE?<br />- A minute or two.
4606103 4608288 We don't have it. Helmets on!
4612109 4613969 Brand, co-pilot, you're up.
4614069 4616638 CASE, blow the cabin oxygen<br />through the main thrusters!
4616738 4618548 - We're gonna spark it.<br />- Roger that.
4618740 4620175 - Locked.<br />- Depressurizing.
4625956 4627307 Engines up!
4656069 4657671 Hello, Rom.
4658030 4659998 I've waited years.
4660782 4663318 How...? How many years?
4664453 4667481 - By now it must be...<br />- Twenty-three years...
4667581 4669591 four months, eight days.
4673712 4675380 Doyle?
4681094 4684297 I thought I was prepared.<br />I knew the theory.
4685474 4687075 Reality's different.
4688018 4689787 And Miller?
4690771 4692873 There's nothing here for us.
4695625 4697127 Why didn't you sleep?
4697986 4702174 Oh, I had a couple of stretches. But I<br />stopped believing you were coming back.
4702574 4705677 And something seemed wrong<br />about dreaming my life away.
4706411 4709348 I learned what I could<br />from the black hole...
4709623 4712151 but I couldn't send anything<br />to your father.
4712251 4714570 We've been receiving,<br />but nothing gets out.
4714670 4717055 - Is he alive?<br />- Oh, yeah.
4717172 4719366 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah.
4721969 4725072 We've got years of messages stored.
4725264 4726498 Cooper.
4726598 4729901 Messages span 23 years.
4731645 4733413 Play it from the beginning.
4736358 4738368 Hey, Dad.
4738902 4741621 Checking in. Saying hi.
4742406 4743974 Um...
4744074 4746167 Finished second in school.
4747452 4750063 Miss Kurling's still<br />giving me C's though.
4750163 4753300 Pulled me down, but<br />seconds not bad.
4754167 4756736 Grandpa attended the ceremony.
4757963 4760065 Um... Oh.
4760924 4762951 I met another girl, Dad.
4763051 4764936 I, uh...
4765387 4767689 I really think this is the one.
4768682 4771968 Name's Lois. That's<br />her right there.
4774313 4776815 Murphy stole Grandpa's car.
4776982 4780051 She crashed it.<br />She's okay, though.
4780319 4781803 Hey, Dad.
4782321 4783955 Look at this!
4784489 4786291 You're a grandpa.
4787409 4789377 His name's Jesse.
4789745 4794900 I kind of wanted to call him Coop,<br />but Lois says, uh... maybe next time.
4795000 4799521 Donald says he's already earned the "great"<br />part, so we just leave it at that.
4802591 4804484 Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
4805177 4809114 Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."<br />Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.
4809431 4812033 Sorry it's been a while.
4813310 4814953 Just...
4816563 4818965 what with Jesse and all.
4821943 4823545 Uh...
4825072 4827707 Grandpa died last week.
4827824 4831411 We buried him out in the back forty<br />next to Mom and...
4831787 4833471 Jesse.
4833747 4837333 Which is where we would have buried you<br />if you'd ever...
4837584 4839686 come back.
4840587 4843139 Murph was there at the funeral.
4843465 4846418 We don't see her that much,<br />but she came for that.
4849429 4852448 You aren't listening to this,<br />I know that.
4854976 4857829 All these messages<br />are just, like...
4858897 4863067 drifting out there<br />in the darkness.
4863652 4866087 Lois says that, uh...
4866780 4869808 I have to let you go.
4869908 4871843 And, uh...
4872244 4873928 So...
4876581 4879868 I guess I'm letting you go.
4880627 4883796 I don't know where<br />you are, Dad...
4883922 4886850 but I hope that you're at peace.
4888343 4889728 Goodbye.
4903024 4904676 Hey, Dad.
4907112 4908347 Hey, Murph.
4908447 4910865 You son of a bitch.
4914077 4916646 I never made one of these<br />when you were still responding...
4916746 4919382 because I was so mad<br />at you for leaving.
4922127 4924612 And then when you<br />went quiet, it...
4926840 4930276 seemed like I should live with<br />that decision. And I have.
4934181 4936900 But today's my birthday.
4940270 4943940 And it's a special one,<br />because you told me...
4947569 4952207 You once told me that when you came back,<br />we might be the same age.
4953617 4957003 And today I'm the age you were<br />when you left.
4959706 4961858 So it would be a real good time<br />for you to come back.
4976264 4980660 I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that<br />I've never seen you in here before.
4981186 4983455 I've never been in here before.
4985232 4990470 I talk to Amelia<br />all the time. It helps.
4990737 4993557 - I'm glad you've started.<br />- I haven't. I...
4993657 4996259 I just had something<br />I needed to get out.
4996493 4998979 - I know they're still out there.<br />- I know.
4999079 5003358 There are so many reasons their<br />communications might not be getting through.
5003458 5004976 I know, professor.
5005502 5008521 I'm not sure what<br />I'm more afraid of.
5009589 5012425 Them never coming back or...
5013134 5016413 coming back to<br />find we've failed.
5016513 5018031 Then let's succeed.
5018974 5020516 So...
5020725 5024963 back to the fourth iteration.<br />Let's run it through some new fields.
5025063 5028467 With respect, professor,<br />we've tried that hundreds of times.
5028567 5032737 It only has to work once, Murph.
5035532 5039478 Every rivet that they strike<br />could have been a bullet.
5039578 5041646 We've done well for<br />the world here...
5041746 5046568 whether or not we crack the equation<br />before I kick the bucket.
5046668 5049646 - Don't be morbid, professor.<br />- I'm not afraid of death.
5050297 5052632 I'm an old physicist.
5053383 5055151 I'm afraid of time.
5062225 5063493 Time.
5065437 5067205 You're afraid of time.
5069691 5071760 We've been trying<br />to solve the equation...
5071860 5074429 without changing<br />the underlying assumption about time.
5074529 5076306 - And?<br />- And that means...
5076406 5080936 each iteration is an attempt<br />to prove its own proof.
5081036 5083355 It's recursive.<br />It's nonsensical.
5083455 5087317 Are you calling my life's work...<br />nonsense, Murph?
5087417 5089328 No, I'm saying<br />that you've been trying to...
5089428 5093723 finish it with one arm...<br />No, with both arms tied behind your back.
5095508 5097910 And I don't understand why.
5098470 5100705 I'm an old man, Murph.
5101222 5103917 Can we take this point up<br />at another time?
5104017 5106444 I want to talk to my daughter.
5108313 5110840 Stepping out into the universe...
5110940 5114836 we must confront the reality<br />of interstellar travel.
5115654 5120267 We must reach far beyond<br />our own lifespans.
5120367 5125897 We must think not as individuals<br />but as a species.
5128333 5131660 Do not go gentle<br />into that good night.
5133129 5135782 TARS kept the Endurance<br />right where we needed her.
5135882 5138777 But the trip took years longer<br />than we anticipated.
5139010 5142614 We no longer have the fuel<br />to visit both prospects, so...
5142847 5144649 we have to choose.
5145558 5146985 But how?
5147727 5149696 They're both promising.
5150939 5155510 Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann<br />is the one still transmitting, so...
5155610 5158830 We've no reason to suspect<br />Edmunds's data would have soured.
5159447 5162017 His world has key elements<br />to sustain human life.
5162117 5165586 - As does Dr. Mann's.<br />- Cooper, this is my field.
5166454 5167797 And...
5168289 5170525 I really believe Edmunds'<br />is the better prospect.
5170625 5174262 - Why?<br />- Gargantua, that's why.
5175088 5179200 Look at Miller's planet.<br />Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...
5179300 5184022 but no life. Sterile.<br />We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
5184139 5185999 Because of the black hole?
5186099 5189210 Murphy's Law.<br />Whatever can happen will happen.
5189310 5191713 Accident is the first building block<br />of evolution.
5191813 5194716 But when you're orbiting a black hole<br />not enough can happen.
5194816 5199387 It sucks in asteroids and comets, other<br />events which would otherwise reach you.
5199487 5201622 We need to go further afield.
5201948 5204584 You once said that Dr. Mann...
5205535 5207228 was the best of us.
5207328 5210798 He's remarkable.<br />We're only here because of him.
5211040 5212942 And yet... Yet here he is.
5213042 5217328 He's on the ground, and he's sending<br />a very unambiguous message,
5217428 5219949 telling us to come<br />to his planet.
5220049 5224979 Granted, but Edmunds' data<br />is more promising.
5225138 5226247 We should vote.
5226347 5228816 Well, if we vote,<br />there's something you should know.
5229642 5232820 Brand? He has a right to know.
5233021 5234839 That has nothing to do with it.
5234939 5238051 - What does?<br />- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.
5238151 5241195 - Is that true?<br />- Yes.
5243865 5246876 And that makes me<br />want to follow my heart.
5250038 5253775 But maybe we've spent too long trying<br />to figure all this out with theory.
5253875 5255360 You're a scientist, Brand.
5255460 5257303 So listen to me...
5257837 5262850 when I say that love<br />isn't something we invented. It's...
5263551 5266187 observable, powerful.
5267972 5269649 It has to mean something.
5269749 5274095 Love has meaning, yes. Social utility,<br />social bonding, child rearing...
5274195 5277999 We love people who have died.<br />Where's the social utility in that?
5278441 5279551 None.
5279651 5283596 Maybe it means something more,<br />something we can't...
5283696 5285807 yet understand.
5285907 5289669 Maybe it's some<br />evidence, some...
5290328 5294858 artifact of a higher dimension<br />that we can't consciously perceive.
5294958 5299821 I'm drawn across the universe<br />to someone I haven't seen in a decade...
5299921 5302991 who I know is probably dead.
5303091 5306494 Love is the one thing<br />we're capable of perceiving...
5306594 5309730 that transcends dimensions<br />of time and space.
5311266 5315903 Maybe we should trust that,<br />even if we can't understand it yet.
5320608 5322577 All right, Cooper...
5324153 5325746 yes...
5326614 5330151 the tiniest possibility<br />of seeing Wolf again excites me.
5330785 5332753 That doesn't mean I'm wrong.
5333162 5335631 Honestly, Amelia...
5337125 5338393 it might.
5345091 5348102 TARS, chart a course for<br />Dr. Mann's.
5364894 5368164 We'll lose about a third again.<br />But next year...
5370158 5373094 Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm<br />and we'll make it up.
5373828 5375963 What happened to Nelson?
5381586 5383863 Murph, have you eaten enough?<br />Would you like some more souffle?
5383963 5387642 Oh, no. I'm full, thanks.<br />It was delicious.
5388217 5390519 Coop, finish your<br />fritter, please.
5392388 5396167 Will you spend the night? Your room<br />is exactly as you left it. It's ready.
5396267 5397710 I need to get back.
5397810 5399621 My sewing machine is in there,<br />but there's plenty...
5399721 5402114 I need to...
5404692 5406735 Too many memories.
5406861 5409756 We might have something for that.<br />Hey, Coop.
5417205 5418598 The dust.
5421000 5423444 Lois, I have a friend who...
5423844 5425680 could look at his lungs.
5443564 5446301 - Amelia, I'm sorry.<br />- You were just being objective.
5446401 5449929 Unless you're punishing me<br />for screwing up on Miller's planet.
5450029 5452581 No, this wasn't a<br />personal decision.
5453116 5457228 If you're wrong, you will have<br />a very personal decision to make.
5457328 5460523 Your fuel calculations<br />are based on a return journey.
5460623 5464694 Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have<br />to decide whether to return home...
5464794 5467155 or push on to<br />Edmunds' with Plan B.
5467255 5471159 Starting a colony could save us<br />from extinction.
5471259 5474495 You might have to decide<br />between seeing your children again...
5474595 5476531 and the future of<br />the human race.
5477732 5479742 I trust you'll be<br />as objective then.
5486524 5488509 He's been asking for you<br />since he came to.
5488609 5490336 We were trying to reach you.
5496200 5497543 Murph.
5498244 5500046 I'm here, professor.
5500455 5502824 I let you all down.
5503124 5506761 No, you got us so far.<br />Real close.
5508296 5510156 I'll finish what you started.
5510256 5512767 Good, good Murph.
5514761 5517355 You had faith...
5518264 5519857 all those...
5520516 5522610 all those years.
5523978 5525296 I...
5525396 5528199 I asked you to have faith.
5529650 5532745 I wanted you to believe...
5533946 5536123 that your father...
5538826 5540728 would come back.
5540828 5542121 I do, professor.
5543748 5548002 - Forgive me, Murph.<br />- There's nothing to forgive.
5551071 5554433 I... I lied, Murph.
5556511 5558604 I lied to you.
5564644 5567955 There was no need for him to...
5569065 5571242 To come back.
5573528 5577164 There is no way to help us.
5578157 5579500 But Plan A...
5579742 5583170 All this. All these people.
5583996 5586091 And the equation.
5589794 5591646 Did my father know?
5595341 5597551 Did he leave me?
5601013 5602356 Do...
5603224 5604859 not...
5605518 5607069 go...
5607979 5610064 gentle...
5611566 5613033 No.
5614402 5615986 No!
5616696 5618639 You can't leave.
5618739 5620291 You... No.
5621075 5626046 Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that<br />your father died today. He had no pain.
5626230 5628399 He was at peace.
5628666 5631051 I'm very sorry for your loss.
5643347 5645116 Brand, did you know?
5647435 5649403 He told you, right?
5651981 5653857 You knew.
5655276 5657369 This was all a sham.
5661449 5663634 You left us here.
5665286 5667087 To suffocate.
5668956 5670591 To starve.
5697652 5699086 Frozen cloud.
5843422 5846684 It's okay. It's okay.
5853224 5855025 It's okay.
5860147 5862449 Pray you never learn...
5863317 5866954 just how good it can be<br />to see another face.
5875079 5877648 I hadn't a lot of hope<br />to begin with, but...
5877748 5880384 after so long, I had none.
5881552 5884888 My supplies were<br />completely exhausted.
5886549 5890602 The last time I went to sleep,<br />I didn't even set a waking date.
5894014 5896900 You have literally raised me<br />from the dead.
5897643 5899893 - Lazarus.<br />- Hm.
5900729 5904283 - What about the others?<br />- I'm afraid you're it, sir.
5904692 5907411 So far, surely.
5907862 5912800 No, our present situation is that there's<br />very little chance of rescuing any others.
5916454 5918964 Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?
5919540 5921433 Tell us about your world.
5924712 5926655 Our world, we hope.
5930384 5932787 Our world, uh... is cold...
5932887 5934680 stark...
5936056 5938192 but undeniably beautiful.
5940144 5943697 The days are 67 hours long, cold.
5947601 5949220 The nights are...
5949320 5952155 67 far colder hours.
5957495 5961899 The gravity is a very, very pleasant<br />80 percent of the Earth's.
5961999 5965236 Now, up here where I landed,<br />the water is alkali...
5965336 5969156 and the air has too much ammonia to breathe<br />for more than just a few minutes...
5969256 5973911 but down at the surface,<br />and there is a surface...
5974011 5975703 the chlorine dissipates.
5975804 5979917 The ammonia gives way to crystalline<br />hydrocarbons and breathable air.
5980017 5984288 To organics. Possibly<br />even to life.
5985022 5987241 We might be sharing this world.
5987483 5989310 These readings are<br />from the surface?
5989410 5993013 Over the years,<br />I've dropped various probes.
5993113 5996600 - How far have you explored?<br />- I've mounted several major expeditions.
5996700 6000821 But with oxygen in limited supply,<br />KIPP there really did most of the legwork.
6000921 6003649 - What went wrong with him, sir?<br />- Degeneration.
6003749 6007403 He misidentified the first organics<br />we found as ammonia crystals.
6007503 6011699 We struggled on for a time,<br />but ultimately I decommissioned him and...
6011799 6014034 used his power source<br />to keep the mission going.
6014134 6017204 I thought I was alone<br />before I shut him down.
6017304 6019273 Would you like me<br />to look at him?
6019473 6021709 No. No. He needs a human touch.
6021809 6026380 Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message<br />for you from the comm station.
6026480 6029241 Okay. Be right there.<br />Excuse me.
6040953 6043639 Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you<br />that your father died today.
6044248 6046374 He had no pain.
6049003 6050804 He was at peace.
6052590 6054725 I'm sorry for your loss.
6056802 6058145 Is that Murph?
6058554 6061081 She's... She's grown.
6061181 6063266 Brand, did you know?
6063934 6066103 He told you, right?
6068647 6070240 You knew.
6071692 6073293 This was all a sham.
6074236 6076404 You left us here.
6078032 6079833 To suffocate.
6081619 6083295 To starve.
6086332 6088116 Did my father know too?
6090502 6092262 Dad?
6093714 6095933 I just want to know...
6096967 6099169 if you left me here to die.
6101555 6103857 I just have to know.
6109063 6110781 Cooper, my...
6111982 6114176 My father dedicated...
6114276 6119781 his whole life to Plan A.<br />I have no idea what she's talking about.
6121091 6122659 I do.
6127289 6130258 He never even hoped<br />to get the people off the Earth?
6131168 6132678 No.
6136423 6140560 But he's been trying to solve<br />the gravity equation for 40 years.
6140761 6144481 Amelia, your father solved his equation<br />before I even left.
6144765 6146709 Then why wouldn't he use it?
6146809 6150838 The equation couldn't reconcile relativity<br />with quantum mechanics. You need more.
6150938 6152923 More? More what?
6153023 6156093 More data.<br />You need to see into a black hole.
6156193 6158345 The laws of nature prohibit<br />a naked singularity.
6158445 6160247 Romilly, is that true?
6161240 6165019 If a black hole is an oyster,<br />then the singularity's the pearl inside.
6165119 6169956 The gravity's so strong, it's always<br />hidden in darkness... behind the horizon.
6170874 6173027 That's why we call<br />it a black hole.
6173127 6176847 Okay, but if we see<br />beyond the horizon...
6177131 6178699 We can't, Coop.
6178799 6181535 There are some things<br />that aren't meant to be known.
6181635 6185748 Your father had to find another way<br />to save the human race from extinction.
6185848 6189484 - Plan B. A colony.<br />- Why not tell people?
6190769 6193922 - Why keep building those stations?<br />- He knew how hard it would be...
6194022 6198218 to get people to work together to save<br />the species instead of themselves.
6198518 6200763 - Or their children.<br />- Bullshit.
6200863 6203823 You never would've come here<br />unless you believed you would save them.
6203824 6206702 Evolution has yet to transcend<br />that simple barrier.
6206802 6210694 We can care deeply,<br />selflessly about those we know,
6210794 6213400 but that empathy rarely extends<br />beyond our line of sight.
6213500 6215510 But the lie.
6218505 6221124 That monstrous lie?
6222176 6225395 Unforgivable.<br />And he knew that.
6225846 6230250 He was prepared to destroy his own humanity<br />in order to save the species.
6230350 6233070 - He made an incredible sacrifice.<br />- No.
6234188 6239167 An incredible sacrifice is being made<br />by the people on Earth who are gonna die!
6239526 6241795 Because in his<br />fucking arrogance...
6242112 6244298 he declared their case hopeless.
6244865 6248435 I'm sorry, Cooper...<br />their case is hopeless.
6248535 6250962 No. No.
6251288 6252890 We are the future.
6256460 6258678 Cooper, what can I do?
6261590 6263525 Let me go home.
6264009 6266028 You're absolutely positive?
6266553 6269156 His solution was correct.<br />He'd had it for years.
6269723 6272451 - It's worthless?<br />- It's half the answer.
6273310 6276413 Okay, how do you<br />find the other half?
6276897 6278632 Out there? A black hole.
6278732 6281868 - But stuck down here on Earth?<br />- Yeah?
6282903 6284871 I'm not sure you can.
6286490 6289459 God, they just pack up and leave.
6290577 6292963 What are they hoping to find?
6293247 6294589 Survival.
6302089 6303473 Damn it.
6306093 6309988 Murph, don't...?<br />Don't people have a right to know?
6310514 6314668 Panic won't help. We just<br />have to keep working, same as ever.
6314768 6318172 But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand<br />was manipulating us to do?
6318272 6321625 Brand gave up on us.<br />I'm still trying to solve this.
6322150 6323735 So...
6324653 6326622 do you have an idea?
6327030 6328665 A feeling.
6331785 6334087 I told you about my ghost.
6335789 6338092 My dad thought I<br />called it a ghost...
6338192 6340260 because I was scared of it.
6343422 6345755 But I was never scared of it.
6346967 6349936 I called it a ghost<br />because it felt...
6352055 6354024 It felt like a person.
6356268 6358236 It was trying to<br />tell me something.
6360898 6364001 If there's an answer here on Earth,<br />it's back there...
6364359 6368872 somehow, in that room.<br />So I have to find it.
6371992 6374044 We're running out of time.
6375662 6377731 What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?
6377831 6380067 No, they can stay.<br />I'll be sleeping anyway.
6380167 6381819 - Hey, Coop?<br />- Yeah?
6381919 6383987 I have a suggestion<br />for your return journey.
6384087 6386940 - Yeah, what's that?<br />- Have one last crack at the black hole.
6388717 6390169 I'm going home, Rom.
6390269 6394022 Yeah, I know.<br />This isn't going to cost you any time.
6394473 6396508 There's a chance for<br />the people on Earth.
6397059 6400170 - Talk to me.<br />- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.
6400270 6404216 - It's what we call a gentle singularity.<br />- Gentle?
6404316 6407845 They're hardly gentle.<br />But the tidal gravity is so quick that...
6407945 6412266 something crossing the horizon fast<br />might survive. A probe, say.
6412366 6417104 - What happens after it crosses?<br />- After the horizon is a complete mystery.
6417204 6420357 So, what's to say<br />there isn't some way that the probe...
6420457 6423443 can glimpse the singularity<br />and relay the quantum data?
6423543 6426864 If he's equipped to transmit<br />every form of energy that can pulse.
6426964 6430058 Just when did this probe<br />become a "he," professor?
6430300 6432352 TARS is the obvious candidate.
6432886 6434872 I've already told him<br />what to look for.
6434972 6437749 I'd need the old optical transmitter<br />off KIPP, Cooper.
6437849 6439251 You'd do this for us?
6439351 6443572 Before you get all teary, remember that<br />as a robot I have to do anything you say.
6444189 6447659 - Your cue light's broken.<br />- I'm not joking.
6449987 6453307 I'm gonna need TARS to remove and adapt<br />some components from KIPP.
6453407 6455809 I don't want to disturb<br />his archival functions.
6455909 6457644 I'll supervise.
6457744 6458854 All right.
6458954 6463692 Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure<br />sites. One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.
6463792 6466320 Once those modules have landed,<br />you don't want to move them.
6466420 6469031 I can take you to the probe sites,<br />but I don't think...
6469131 6471909 these conditions are gonna hold.<br />I think we should wait.
6472009 6474912 CASE is headed down<br />with the rest of the distillery equipment.
6475012 6478148 I'd really like to secure<br />those sites by nightfall.
6479766 6483153 Well, these squalls<br />do usually blow over.
6483270 6484463 Okay, then.
6484563 6486840 - You'll need a long-range transmitter.<br />- Got it.
6486940 6488783 - Are you charged?<br />- Yeah.
6489067 6490410 Follow me.
6490902 6494548 - TARS, 72 hours, yeah?<br />- Roger that, Cooper.
6500746 6504090 Brand told me why you feel<br />you have to go back.
6505525 6508612 But I'd be remiss<br />if I didn't at least mention...
6508712 6512983 that a mission such as ours<br />could certainly use an extra engineer.
6514718 6519072 You better slow down, turbo.<br />Safety first, CASE, remember.
6519598 6521650 Safety first, Cooper.
6522601 6525679 I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,<br />I'm honored to be a part of this.
6525979 6531285 But once we set up base camp and secure<br />those modules, my work's done here.
6531401 6532736 I'm going home.
6540744 6543904 You have attachments.<br />But even without a family...
6544004 6549427 I can promise you that that yearning<br />to be with other people is powerful.
6549795 6553431 That emotion is at<br />the foundation...
6553799 6556943 of what makes us human.<br />It's not to be taken lightly.
6564851 6567537 - How long have you had that cough?<br />- A while.
6577989 6580208 Mom lets me play in here.
6581627 6583378 I don't touch your stuff.
6614067 6615994 Just take this gently.
6620824 6624502 You know why we couldn't just send machines<br />on these missions, don't you, Cooper?
6624828 6629557 A machine doesn't improvise well<br />because you can't program a fear of death.
6630333 6634652 Our survival instinct is our single<br />greatest source of inspiration.
6634766 6636681 Take you, for example.
6637090 6638725 A father...
6638925 6642228 with a survival instinct<br />that extends to your kids.
6643096 6648067 What does research tell us is the last<br />thing you're going to see before you die?
6649477 6652172 Your children. Their faces.
6652272 6657035 At the moment of death, your mind's<br />gonna push a little bit harder to survive.
6657444 6658986 For them.
6659362 6660914 Deep breath.
6662908 6666853 Uh, hey. I bet you're Coop.<br />Why don't you have a seat here for me?
6666953 6669589 It's bad.<br />They cannot stay here.
6669998 6671391 - Okay?<br />- Yeah.
6679633 6681159 TARS, what's taking so long?
6681259 6684204 Professor, I am having trouble<br />completing the boot up.
6684304 6686047 I don't understand.
6692646 6694197 It's funny.
6695982 6697909 When I left Earth...
6698610 6700995 I thought I was prepared to die.
6702739 6704574 The truth is...
6706284 6711589 I never really considered the possibility<br />that my planet wasn't the one.
6714000 6716403 Nothing worked out the way<br />it was supposed to.
6716503 6718045 Let's go.
6726012 6728907 All right, buddy,<br />give me a big deep breath.
6733603 6735121 What is this?
6735438 6739509 - What are you doing?<br />- I'm sorry! I can't let you leave with that ship.
6739609 6742179 We're gonna need it<br />to complete the mission...
6742279 6745891 once the others realize<br />what this place isn't.
6745991 6750312 We cannot survive here.<br />I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
6760005 6763200 - They can't stay here anymore.<br />- You have to leave right now.
6763300 6766912 Let me make something abundantly clear.<br />You have a responsibility...
6767012 6770273 - Oh! Jesus!<br />- Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.
6770473 6772459 Dad didn't raise you<br />to be this dumb, Tom!
6772559 6776746 Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did. And<br />he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.
6777230 6780199 You faked all the data?
6781609 6782994 Yeah.
6786698 6788475 There's no surface?
6788575 6790043 No.
6790702 6792771 I tried to do my duty, Cooper...
6792871 6798176 but I knew the day that I arrived here<br />that this place had nothing.
6798501 6802597 And I resisted<br />the temptation for years...
6802922 6805242 but I knew that...
6805342 6808370 if I just pressed<br />that button, then...
6808470 6810572 somebody would come and save me.
6811514 6813116 You fucking coward.
6813850 6814993 Yes.
6820315 6821658 Yes.
6823276 6824619 Yes.
6825570 6826680 Yes.
6838124 6842770 Listen, if you're not going to go,<br />let your family go. Just save your family.
6843171 6847617 And we go live underground with you?<br />Pray that Daddy comes to save us?
6847717 6851691 Dad's not coming back.<br />He never was coming back. It's up to me.
6851791 6854704 You're gonna save everybody?<br />Because Dad couldn't do it.
6854804 6859112 Dad didn't even try!<br />Dad just abandoned us!
6859562 6861656 He left us here to die.
6862065 6863833 Nobody's going with you.
6867445 6870456 You gonna wait for<br />your next kid to die?
6873159 6874752 Get out.
6875328 6876963 And don't come back.
6881543 6883678 You can keep my stuff.
6894305 6895982 Stop it!
6898685 6900570 No. No!
6901354 6904532 Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance<br />you're gonna kill yourself!
6905066 6907135 Those are the best odds<br />I've had in years.
6927505 6929640 Don't judge me, Cooper.
6930091 6934429 You were never tested like I was.<br />Few men have been.
6942770 6944238 You tried your best, Murph.
6953448 6955746 You're feeling it, aren't you?
6956493 6958628 The survival instinct.
6959245 6963683 That's what drove me. It's what drives<br />all of us. And it's what's gonna save us.
6964751 6968387 Because I want to save all of us.<br />For you, Cooper.
6973259 6977038 I'm sorry, I can't watch you<br />go through this. I'm sorry.
6977138 6980107 I thought I could, but I can't.
6980892 6983253 I'm here. I'm here for you.
6983353 6985696 Just listen to my voice, Cooper.
6986189 6988024 I'm right here.
6989359 6990993 You're not alone.
7000411 7002113 Do you see your children?
7005166 7006801 It's okay.
7007460 7009512 They're right there with you.
7013091 7015977 Did Professor Brand tell you<br />that poem before you left?
7016511 7018312 Do you remember?
7020390 7023659 Do not go gentle into that good night.
7024978 7029824 Old age should burn and rave<br />At close of day.
7031109 7033786 Rage, rage against<br />the dying of the light.
7058136 7059871 Brand! Help!
7059971 7062231 - Help!<br />- Cooper?
7068646 7070131 CASE!
7070231 7071824 No air.
7072358 7073868 Ammonia.
7074652 7077222 Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE!
7077322 7079307 - I have a fix.<br />- Go! Go, go, go!
7079407 7081792 And away!
7093046 7095323 Cooper, we're coming.<br />Hang in there. Don't talk.
7095423 7098017 Try to breathe as little as possible.<br />We're almost there.
7101487 7107109 There's a security lockout, sir.<br />It requires a person to access function.
7111856 7113658 It's all yours, sir.
7121674 7123434 Try not to breathe.
7124035 7128064 We're coming. We're coming right now.<br />CASE, come on! Come on!
7128164 7131175 We got to go faster, CASE!<br />Faster, faster, faster!
7135380 7137390 Hang in there. Come on.
7143596 7147191 I see him, I see him!<br />CASE, bank! Bank right!
7165910 7169013 Cooper! Cooper! I'm here!
7192145 7194347 This data makes no sense.
7202572 7204057 I'm sorry.
7204157 7207043 - What?<br />- Mann was lying!
7214500 7216594 Go. Go.
7217378 7218696 Romilly.
7218796 7220073 Romilly!
7220173 7222892 Romilly!<br />Do you read me, Romilly?
7223176 7225278 Step back, professor! Step back!
7233102 7235988 - Romilly...<br />- Romilly, do you read me?
7238691 7240526 Keep watch!
7241194 7242420 Lois?
7242820 7245623 - What happened to caution, CASE?<br />- Safety first, Cooper.
7246699 7250419 Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?<br />This is Brand.
7252997 7254107 Romilly?
7254207 7257093 Dr. Brand. Cooper.<br />There's been an explosion.
7257418 7259512 Dr. Mann's compound.
7286823 7289166 TARS, TARS, 10 o'clock!
7295248 7297508 Let me know when TARS is aboard.
7300837 7303013 Romilly did not survive.
7303923 7305658 I could not save him.
7305758 7307319 - TARS is in.<br />- I'll take her now.
7307385 7310329 - Do we have a fix on the Ranger?<br />- He's pushing into orbit!
7310429 7313732 If he takes control<br />of that ship, we're dead.
7314642 7317903 - He'd maroon us?<br />- He is marooning us.
7319605 7322408 I'll meet you guys downstairs.<br />Go wait by the car.
7329949 7334461 Come on! Give me your bag. Get in the<br />backseat. Get in the backseat now!
7339792 7342011 Dr. Mann, please respond.
7342336 7344489 Dr. Mann, please respond!
7344789 7346909 He doesn't know<br />the Endurance docking procedure.
7346966 7349768 - The autopilot does.<br />- Not since TARS disabled it.
7350678 7351788 Nice.
7351888 7355107 - What's your trust setting, TARS?<br />- Lower than yours apparently.
7358436 7362048 Do not attempt docking.<br />I repeat, do not attempt docking.
7362148 7363257 Please res...
7422625 7425069 Auto-docking sequence withheld.
7425169 7428138 - Override.<br />- Unauthorized.
7428547 7430182 Override.
7430383 7432559 Unauthorized.
7436389 7440618 Do not attempt docking. I repeat,<br />do not attempt docking. Please resp...
7484311 7486580 Moving slowly toward<br />the Endurance.
7511005 7512657 Imperfect contact.
7512757 7515100 - Override.<br />- Hatch lockout.
7522600 7525444 - Is he locked on yet?<br />- Imperfectly.
7526979 7528297 Dr. Mann, do not...
7549710 7553013 Hatch lockout disengaged.
7561263 7565001 Dr. Mann, do not,<br />I repeat, do not open the hatch.
7565101 7567044 I repeat, do not open the hatch.
7567144 7570280 If you open the hatch,<br />the airlock will depressurize.
7595881 7598475 - What happens if he blows the airlock?<br />- Nothing good.
7604056 7606751 Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters,<br />everything we've got, CASE!
7606851 7608627 - Thrusters are full!<br />- Back!
7608727 7610796 Relay my transmission<br />to the onboard computer...
7610896 7613049 and have it rebroadcast<br />as emergency P.A.
7613149 7614491 Dr. Mann...
7616777 7619722 I repeat, do not open<br />the inner hatch. I repeat...
7619822 7621165 Brand?
7621699 7623809 I don't know what<br />he said to you...
7623909 7626879 but I am taking command<br />of the Endurance.
7627037 7629381 And then we can talk<br />about completing the mission.
7632543 7634353 Dr. Mann, listen to me.
7635045 7637347 This is not about my life.
7637673 7641226 Or Cooper's life.<br />This is about all mankind.
7641510 7643128 There is a moment...
7649268 7650703 It is not sa...
7658903 7660045 Oh, my God.
7678255 7682518 - There's no point using fuel to chase...<br />- Analyze the Endurance's spin.
7687473 7689983 - Cooper, what are you doing?<br />- Docking.
7694271 7697174 Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.
7697274 7699802 Okay, get ready to match our spin<br />with the retro thrusters.
7699902 7703422 - It's not possible.<br />- No... it's necessary.
7714959 7717427 Endurance is hitting stratosphere!
7721173 7723517 She's got no heat shield.
7726345 7728197 - CASE, you ready?<br />- Ready.
7736522 7739992 Cooper! This is no time for caution.
7741235 7743762 CASE, if I black out,<br />you take the stick.
7743862 7746623 TARS, get ready to engage<br />the docking mechanism.
7753372 7756442 - Endurance is starting to heat.<br />- Twenty feet out.
7756542 7759111 I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.
7759211 7761280 Ten feet out.
7761380 7763949 Cooper, we are lined up.
7764049 7765734 Initiating spin!
7807217 7808527 Come on, TARS.
7816685 7818328 Come on, TARS!
7829448 7832167 - We are locked, Cooper.<br />- Locked. Easing up!
7839750 7841385 Easy.
7842252 7843887 Easy.
7849426 7850828 Retro thrusters!
7858894 7860696 Main engines on.
7866151 7869062 Pushing out of orbit.<br />Come on, baby.
7876870 7878839 Killing main engines!
7879790 7881758 Okay, we're out of orbit.
7888799 7891877 Okay. And for our next trick!
7893512 7897649 It'll have to be good.<br />We're heading into Gargantua's pull.
7898267 7899409 Oh, shit.
7899810 7901703 - CASE, take the stick.<br />- Roger that.
7951570 7954006 Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.
7955240 7957267 Shall I use main engines?
7957367 7961546 No. We got to let her slide<br />as far as we can.
7970047 7972991 - Give it to me.<br />- There's good news, there's bad news.
7973091 7976820 Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS.<br />Give it to me straight.
7985562 7988841 The backup generator kicked in,<br />so the system's stable. They're all good.
7988941 7990283 Good.
7990400 7993804 Okay. The navigational hub<br />has been completely destroyed.
7993904 7996932 We don't have enough life support<br />to make it back to Earth, but...
7997032 7999184 I think we can scratch our way<br />to Edmunds' planet.
7999284 8003639 - What about fuel?<br />- Not enough. But I have a plan.
8004164 8008568 We let Gargantua pull us down<br />close to her horizon.
8008669 8011989 Then a powered slingshot around,<br />launching us towards Edmunds' planet.
8012089 8014658 - Manually?<br />- That's what I'm here for.
8014758 8017336 I'm gonna take us<br />just inside the critical orbit.
8017436 8020276 - What about time slippage?<br />- Neither of us has time to worry...
8020305 8022275 about relativity right now,<br />Dr. Brand.
8026603 8028205 I'm sorry, Cooper.
8031233 8034720 Once we've gathered<br />enough speed around Gargantua...
8034820 8036955 we use Lander 1...
8037155 8039749 and Ranger 2 as<br />rocket boosters to...
8040317 8043119 push us out of the<br />black hole's gravity.
8044955 8047691 The Lender's linkages<br />have been destroyed...
8047791 8050427 so we'll have to<br />control manually.
8051336 8054665 Once Lander 1 is spent,<br />TARS will detach...
8054765 8056875 And get sucked into that black hole.
8057301 8058928 Why does TARS have to detach?
8059028 8061538 We have to shed the weight<br />to escape the gravity.
8061638 8063081 Newton's third law.
8063181 8065959 The only way humans have ever<br />figured out of getting somewhere...
8066059 8067669 is to leave something behind.
8067769 8070880 Cooper, you can't ask TARS<br />to do this for us.
8070981 8074885 He's a robot. So you don't have<br />to ask him to do anything.
8074985 8078705 - Cooper, you asshole!<br />- Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.
8078905 8081391 It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.
8081491 8084019 It's our only chance<br />to save people on Earth.
8084119 8087397 If I can find a way to transmit<br />the quantum data I'll find in there...
8087497 8089633 they might still make it.
8090576 8093503 Let's just hope<br />there's still someone there to save.
8121490 8123458 Maximum velocity achieved.
8124409 8126979 Prepare to fire<br />escape thrusters.
8127379 8129815 - Ready?<br />- Ready.
8129915 8133110 - Ready.<br />- Main engine ignition in three...
8133210 8134678 two...
8135003 8136938 one. Mark.
8150268 8151820 Come on, baby.
8152688 8155090 Lander 1 engines, on my mark.
8155644 8157843 Three, two...
8157943 8159744 one. Mark.
8164783 8167436 Ranger 2 engines, on my mark.
8167536 8170213 Three, two, one...
8170455 8171923 - Mark.<br />- Fire!
8181758 8185228 This little maneuver's<br />gonna cost us 51 years!
8185804 8188606 You don't sound so<br />bad for pushing 120!
8203697 8207167 Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.
8207534 8210236 Three, two...
8211063 8214099 - one. Mark.<br />- Detach!
8217169 8219738 - Goodbye, TARS.<br />- Goodbye, Dr. Brand.
8219838 8222941 - See you on the other side, Coop.<br />- See you there, Slick!
8231349 8233234 Okay, CASE.
8233677 8237655 - Nice reckless flying!<br />- Learned from the master.
8237814 8240467 - Ranger 2, prepare to detach.<br />- What?
8240567 8243787 No! No! Cooper!<br />What are you doing?
8243945 8247724 Newton's third law.<br />You got to leave something behind.
8247824 8250310 You told me we had enough resources<br />for both of us.
8250410 8252437 We agreed, Amelia...
8252537 8254297 90 percent.
8255874 8257258 Don't.
8259169 8260637 Detach.
8273433 8276586 Okay, I am nosing down.
8279981 8282283 Approaching the event horizon.
8284236 8289040 Portside, dipping down beneath it<br />to go through it.
8290325 8293395 Heading towards blackness.
8293495 8295797 I have a visual of the event.
8295997 8297674 It's all black.
8299701 8303304 TARS, do you read me?<br />It's all blackness.
8305006 8307808 TARS! Do you read me? Over.
8311847 8313314 Okay.
8314224 8315775 Screens...
8317102 8318903 getting interference.
8320313 8323199 Losing control of the stick.<br />I got flashes.
8323483 8325952 Flashes of lightness<br />and blackness.
8326862 8329664 The turbulence in the gravity<br />is increasing.
8334286 8335837 Ah.
8336037 8338247 The computers are going down.<br />Agh.
8349968 8353104 Gravitational pull.<br />I'm losing control of the stick.
8386171 8387939 Murph? Murph, come on!
8393511 8395813 Eject. Eject.
8397015 8398399 Eject.
8398516 8399984 Eject.
8400226 8401569 Eject.
8401978 8403363 Eject.
8515258 8516601 Murph.
8526269 8528538 Murph! Murph! Murph!
8536821 8538164 Murph.
8545080 8547065 No, no, no!
8547165 8548525 Murph!
8548625 8551436 Murph! No! No!
8611020 8613081 If you're leaving, just go.
8613481 8614749 No, no. No.
8616234 8618636 No, don't go.<br />Don't go, you idiot.
8618736 8620329 Don't go!
8621990 8623958 Morse. Morse.
8624409 8625751 Morse.
8626461 8628521 Dot. Dot.
8628621 8629964 S.
8635795 8637138 T.
8641426 8642577 A.
8642677 8643961 Dash!
8646556 8648191 Dash! Dash!
8648391 8649501 Murph!
8649601 8651903 Murph, we don't have time for this!<br />Come on!
8652020 8653646 Y.
8658643 8659785 "Stay!"
8670580 8673216 Come on. Come on, Murph.<br />Come on!
8673583 8675676 What's it say?<br />What's it say, Murph?
8676169 8677753 What's it say?
8687805 8689232 "Stay."
8724676 8727812 Tell him, Murph.<br />Make him stay.
8731231 8732817 Make him stay, Murph.
8741526 8743703 Make him stay, Murph.
8744862 8747290 Don't let me leave, Murph!
8750201 8752920 Don't let me leave, Murph!
8758518 8761353 No! No! No!
8781741 8783542 It was you.
8794412 8796756 You were my ghost.
8806174 8809777 Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.
8810970 8813773 - TARS?<br />- Roger that.
8815266 8818194 - You survived.<br />- Somewhere...
8818436 8820546 in their fifth dimension.
8820646 8823049 They saved us.
8823149 8828429 Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?<br />And just why would they want to help us?
8828529 8831307 I don't know, but they constructed<br />this three-dimensional space...
8831407 8834769 inside their five-dimensional reality<br />to allow you to understand it.
8834869 8836896 Yeah, that ain't working.
8836996 8838606 Yes, it is.
8838706 8842652 You've seen that time is represented here<br />as a physical dimension.
8842752 8845888 You have worked out that you can exert<br />a force across space-time.
8846255 8849701 Gravity to send a message.
8850001 8851635 Affirmative.
8853721 8855347 Gravity...
8855973 8859544 can cross the dimensions,<br />including time.
8859644 8861237 Apparently.
8864816 8867118 Do you have the quantum data?
8867235 8869161 Roger. I have it.
8869821 8873891 I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,<br />but nothing is getting out, Cooper.
8873991 8876544 I can do this. I can do this.
8876702 8879522 But such complicated<br />data to a child?
8879622 8880815 Not just any child.
8880915 8885302 What else? Oh, come on, Dad.
8887171 8889407 Murph, the fire's out! Come on!
8889507 8893811 Even if you communicate it here, she won't<br />understand its significance for years.
8894303 8895830 I get that, TARS.
8895930 8900668 But we've got to figure something out or<br />the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!
8900768 8902420 Cooper...
8902520 8905322 they didn't bring us here<br />to change the past.
8908609 8910178 Say that again.
8910278 8914039 They didn't bring us here<br />to change the past.
8918161 8920421 No, they didn't bring<br />us here at all.
8924750 8926919 We brought ourselves.
8935678 8940024 TARS, give me the coordinates<br />for NASA in binary.
8940266 8943027 In binary. Roger. Feeding data.
8967043 8969461 "It's not a ghost."
8970713 8972448 "It's gravity."
8972548 8974517 Don't you get it yet, TARS?
8974884 8976977 I brought myself here!
8977553 8981357 We're here to communicate<br />with the three-dimensional world.
8981474 8983275 We're the bridge!
8990983 8993077 I thought they chose me.
8996113 9000084 - But they didn't choose me, they chose her.<br />- For what, Cooper?
9002286 9004255 To save the world.
9008251 9012864 All of this is one little girl's bedroom.<br />Every moment.
9012964 9014449 It's infinitely complex.
9014549 9016839 They have access to<br />infinite time and space,
9016864 9019394 but they're not<br />bound by anything!
9019470 9024441 They can't find a specific place in time.<br />They can't communicate.
9025643 9028713 That's why I'm here.<br />I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph...
9028813 9030381 just like I found this moment.
9030481 9032884 - How, Cooper?<br />- Love, TARS, love.
9032984 9037472 It's just like Brand said. My connection with<br />Murph, it is quantifiable. It's the key!
9037572 9039748 What are we here to do?
9040366 9042543 Find how to tell her.
9045037 9046672 The watch.
9049500 9050968 The watch.
9052044 9053470 That's it.
9055673 9058976 We code the data into the movement<br />of the second hand.
9062305 9065583 TARS, translate the data into Morse<br />and feed it to me.
9065683 9070279 Translating data to Morse.<br />Cooper, what if she never came back for it?
9071647 9074617 She will. She will.
9075526 9077453 Murph, I can see his car!
9078362 9079630 He's coming, Murph!
9081365 9083500 Okay. I'm coming down.
9084660 9086462 How do you know?
9089373 9091508 Because I gave it to her.
9096589 9099391 Roger.<br />Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.
9102595 9104022 Dot-dot...
9105056 9107024 dash-dot.
9107183 9109126 Dot-dash-dot-dot.
9109226 9112196 Dot-dash-dot-dot.
9112396 9113965 Dash-dash-dash.
9114065 9116617 Dash, dash, dash.
9134585 9136420 He came back!
9136837 9141308 It was him all the time!<br />I didn't know. It was him!
9142093 9144353 Dad's gonna save us.
9186804 9188155 Eureka!
9191809 9193444 It's traditional.
9197732 9199658 Eureka!
9204071 9205640 Did it work?
9205740 9207875 I think it might have.
9208951 9210311 How do you know?
9210411 9214089 Because the bulk beings<br />are closing the tesseract.
9217626 9219928 Don't you get it yet, TARS?
9220796 9222931 They're not "beings."
9223299 9224933 They're us.
9226677 9230105 What I've been doing for Murph,<br />they're doing for me.
9230347 9231916 For all of us.
9232016 9234335 Cooper, people<br />couldn't build this.
9234435 9237088 No. No, not yet.
9237188 9238947 But one day.
9239315 9242826 Not you and me. But people.
9243194 9247539 A civilization that's evolved past<br />the four dimensions we know.
9253829 9255631 What happens now?
9317935 9319695 Mr. Cooper.
9323607 9325617 All right. Let's take it slow, sir.
9325734 9327928 Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.
9328028 9333375 Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.<br />Actually, you are 124 years old.
9340082 9341717 Take it slow, sir.
9342334 9344862 You were, uh...<br />extremely lucky.
9344962 9348599 The Rangers found you with only minutes<br />left in your oxygen supply.
9362479 9364114 Where am I?
9365482 9367326 Cooper Station.
9368444 9370287 Currently orbiting Saturn.
9371989 9374333 Cooper Station.
9376493 9378562 Nice of you to name it after me.
9382333 9383484 What?
9383584 9386995 The station isn't named after you, sir.<br />It's, uh... named after your daughter.
9387296 9390366 Although she's always maintained<br />just how important you were.
9390466 9392476 Is she still alive?
9394136 9396314 She'll be here in<br />a couple weeks.
9397056 9399583 She is far too old to be transferring<br />from another station...
9399683 9402361 but when she heard<br />that you'd been found...
9403270 9406081 well, this is, uh... Murphy Cooper<br />we're talking about.
9406857 9408659 Yes, it is.
9410486 9413288 We'll have you checked out of here<br />in a couple days.
9415658 9418460 I'm sure you'll be excited to see<br />what's in store.
9419411 9423607 I actually, uh... did a paper on you<br />in high school.
9423707 9426343 I know all about your life<br />back on Earth.
9427711 9428946 Oh, yeah.
9429046 9430597 Right.
9432716 9438355 If... If you'll follow me,<br />we've got a really good situation for you.
9441392 9445737 So, uh... when I made my suggestion<br />to Miss Cooper...
9446355 9449649 I was delighted to hear<br />that she thought it was perfect.
9452528 9455890 It was just constant.<br />Just that steady blow of dirt.
9455990 9458976 Of course,<br />I didn't speak to her personally.
9459076 9461145 We always set the plate upside-down.
9461245 9464064 Glasses or cups,<br />whatever it was, upside-down.
9464164 9469153 Well, my dad was a farmer.<br />Uh, like everybody else back then.
9469253 9471780 There just wasn't enough food.
9471880 9474658 We wore little things, little strips...
9474758 9479997 of sheet over our nose and mouth<br />so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.
9480097 9483626 Well, it was pretty exciting for me<br />because it was hope.
9483726 9488005 I don't care who describes it,<br />there is no way for it to be exaggerated.
9488105 9492009 She did confirm<br />just how much you loved farming.
9492109 9495454 - Oh, she did, did she?<br />- Yeah. Come here.
9495738 9500768 Home sweet home. Everything<br />replaced and put back where it...
9507082 9509193 - Hey, is this...?<br />- Oh, yeah.
9509293 9512363 The machine we found out near Saturn<br />when we found you. Yes.
9512463 9515199 Its, uh... power source was shot,<br />but we could get you another one.
9515299 9517768 Yes. Please.
9518677 9520312 Settings.
9520471 9522272 General settings.
9522473 9524608 Security settings.
9527019 9529613 Honesty, new setting,
9530481 9532341 95 percent.
9532441 9535243 Confirmed. Additional<br />customization?
9535819 9537245 Humor,
9538447 9540224 75 percent.
9540324 9541958 Confirmed.
9542326 9545521 Auto self-destruct<br />T-minus 10, nine...
9545621 9547839 Let's make that 60 percent.
9549833 9552261 Sixty percent confirmed.
9552586 9555972 - Knock-knock.<br />- You want 55?
9560552 9562979 Is this really what it was like?
9564890 9567609 It was never this clean, Slick.<br />Heh.
9571814 9575784 I don't care much for this pretending<br />we're back where we started.
9577569 9580163 I want to know where we are.
9581490 9583333 Where we're going.
9587579 9590733 - Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.<br />- Yeah.
9590833 9591984 Family?
9592084 9596163 Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's<br />been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.
9629037 9631620 You told them I like farming.
9636879 9639047 It was me, Murph.
9641008 9643101 I was your ghost.
9644094 9646021 I know.
9647514 9649197 People didn't believe me.
9649222 9652318 They thought that I was<br />doing it all myself.
9652394 9653737 But...
9656315 9658775 I knew who it was.
9663238 9665707 Nobody believed me.
9665908 9668527 But I knew you'd come back.
9670913 9672422 How?
9674124 9677552 Because my dad promised me.
9683300 9685602 Well, I'm here now, Murph.
9686495 9688430 I'm here.
9689389 9690924 No.
9692809 9697239 No parent should have to watch<br />their own child die.
9699858 9703027 I have my kids here for me now.
9705022 9707123 You go.
9709743 9711545 Where?
9714748 9716633 Brand.
9725976 9728303 <i>She's out there...</i>
9733826 9736278 <i>setting up camp.</i>
9762462 9764472 <i>Alone...</i>
9765340 9768310 <i>in a strange galaxy.</i>
9778895 9783867 <i>Maybe right now<br />she's settling in for the long nap...</i>
9801918 9805055 <i>by the light of our new sun...</i>
9820228 9822572 <i>in our new home.</i>
