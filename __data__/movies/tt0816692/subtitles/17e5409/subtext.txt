75105 76774 OLD WOMAN:<br />Well, my dad was a farmer.
78209 80511 Um... Like everybody else<br />back then.
82812 84715 Of course,<br />he didn't start that way.
90788 92548 MAN ON RADIO: Computer<br />says you're too tight.
92723 94358 Nah, I got this.
94391 95593 Crossing the Straits.
98195 99863 - Shutting it down, Cooper.<br />- Whoa!
99897 101298 (POWERING DOWN)
101331 102700 Shutting it all down.
102733 103768 No, I need power up!
106604 108148 - FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE: Eject!<br />- (COOPER SCREAMING)
108172 109372 YOUNG MURPH: Dad?
115813 118515 Sorry, Murph.<br />Go back to bed, babe.
118548 119817 I thought you were the ghost.
119850 120851 No.
122853 125155 There are no such things<br />as ghosts, babe.
125189 126857 Grandpa says you can get ghosts.
128825 130636 Yeah, maybe that's 'cause<br />Grandpa's a little too close
130660 133630 to being one himself.<br />Back to bed.
133663 135332 Were you dreaming<br />about the crash?
136934 138903 Get your butt back in bed,<br />Murph. (LAUGHS)
166262 167531 OLD MURPH: The wheat had died.
168632 170668 The blight came<br />and we had to burn it.
171802 174638 And we still had corn.<br />We had acres of corn.
174672 176607 But, uh, mostly we had dust.
179610 180653 OLD WOMAN 1:<br />I guess I can't describe it.
180677 182112 It was just constant.
182146 184414 Just that steady blow
184448 185816 of dirt.
188352 191454 OLD WOMAN 2: We wore<br />little strips of sheet
191488 194358 sometimes over<br />our nose and mouth
194391 196560 so that we wouldn't breathe<br />so much of it.
198495 199539 OLD MAN: Well,<br />when we set the table,
199563 200897 we always set the plate
200931 202198 upside-down.
202232 204034 Glasses or cups,<br />whatever it was,
204068 205102 upside-down.
210707 213443 Shake a leg!<br />Murph, get a move on!
213477 215054 COOPER: Tom, 4:00 today,<br />you and me in the barn,
215078 216847 Herbicide Resistance 101.
216880 218582 - Check?<br />- Yes, sir.
218615 219893 - (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)<br />- (DONALD HUMMING)
219917 221185 Not at the table, Murph.
222219 223854 Dad, can you fix this?
225789 227033 COOPER: What the heck<br />did you do to my lander?
227057 228425 Wasn't me.
228459 230492 Let me guess.<br />It was your ghost?
230527 231694 It knocked it off my shelf.
231728 233263 It keeps on knocking books off.
233296 234574 TOM: No such thing as ghosts,<br />dumb-ass.
234598 235733 - Hey.<br />- I looked it up.
235766 237034 It's called a poltergeist.
237067 238434 Dad, tell her.
238469 240737 Well, it's not<br />very scientific, Murph.
240771 243273 You said science was about<br />admitting what we don't know.
243306 244746 - She's got you there.<br />- COOPER: Hey.
245275 246710 Start looking after our stuff.
248245 249546 Coop.
252716 254517 All right, Murph,<br />you want to talk science?
255819 257596 Don't just tell me that<br />you're afraid of some ghost.
257620 259255 No, you got to go further.
259289 260700 You got to record<br />the facts, analyze,
260724 262392 get to the how and the why,
262426 265029 then present your conclusions.<br />Deal?
266063 267097 - Deal.<br />- All right.
270200 271244 Y'all have a good day at school.
271268 272736 DONALD: Hold up.
272770 275238 Parent-teacher conferences.<br />Parent.
275272 276841 Not grandparent.
277340 278576 (HONKING HORN)
279309 280977 Slow down, turbo!
282546 284314 That's not a dust storm.
284348 285628 Nelson's torching<br />his whole crop.
285882 287451 Blight?
287485 289553 They're saying it's<br />the last harvest for okra.
290254 291489 Ever.
293757 296526 He should've planted corn<br />like the rest of us.
296560 297904 Now, you be nice<br />to that Ms. Hanley.
297928 299296 She's single.
299329 300965 What's that supposed to mean?
300998 302365 Repopulating the Earth.
302399 304535 Start pulling your weight,<br />young man.
304568 306804 Well, why don't you start<br />minding your own business,
306837 307905 old man.
315579 316914 All right, Murph,<br />give me second.
318949 319950 Uh-huh.
320417 321751 Third.
322253 323553 (GEARS GRINDING)
323587 325322 - Find a gear, dumb-ass.<br />- Grind it!
325355 326422 Shut it, Tom!
326456 327590 (TIRE HISSING)
327624 328792 What'd you do, Murph?
328825 330160 Aw, she didn't do nothin'.
330193 331428 Blew a tire is all.
331462 332663 Murphy's Law.
333396 334564 Shut up!
334597 335900 Grab the spare, Tom.
335933 336967 That is the spare.
339469 340771 COOPER: Get the patch kit!
342472 344208 TOM: How am I supposed<br />to patch it out here?
344241 345709 COOPER:<br />You got to figure it out.
345743 347343 I'm not always gonna be here<br />to help you.
355852 358188 What's going on, Murph?
358222 361258 Why did you and Mom name me<br />after something that's bad?
361291 362560 Well, we didn't.
363027 364261 Murphy's Law?
365795 370000 Murphy's Law doesn't mean that<br />something bad will happen.
370033 373570 What it means is whatever<br />can happen will happen.
373603 375673 And that sounded<br />just fine with us.
380077 381078 Whoa!
382045 383180 Get in.
384714 386050 Get in, let's go.
387550 388686 What about the flat tire?
388719 389920 (ENGINE STARTING)
392456 393823 Yeah.
407904 409473 It's an Indian Air Force drone.
409506 412142 Solar cells could power<br />an entire farm.
412175 413310 Take the wheel, Tom.
419116 420951 Go, go, go!
422219 423621 Keep that aimed right at it.
431695 433897 Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.
434598 435833 Right at it.
437401 438402 Stay on it.
440203 441205 Here we go. Here we go.
443507 444708 Whoa!
450146 451649 Nice one, Tom.
458121 460057 Dad?
460090 462426 I almost got it.<br />Don't stop. Don't stop!
463126 464128 Dad!
464427 465662 Tom!
470567 472369 Why? You told me<br />to keep driving.
473670 475238 Well, I guess that<br />answers the old,
475271 477775 "If I asked you to<br />drive off a cliff" scenario.
481144 482479 We lost it.
482513 483814 No, we didn't.
496693 498128 Want to give it a whirl?
504100 505703 This...
511140 512142 Go.
513443 516080 Let's lay her down<br />right there at the edge<br />of the reservoir.
520484 522085 Nicely done.
525321 527356 TOM: How long you think<br />it's been up there?
527390 529893 Delhi Mission Control<br />went down, same as ours,
529926 531261 - 10 years ago.<br />- Oh!
532229 533964 So for 10 years?
537401 538445 Why did it come down so low?
538469 540003 I don't know.
540036 541571 Maybe the sun cooked its brain
541605 542649 or it was looking for something.
542673 543873 What?
543906 545775 Give me a large flatblade.
545809 548112 Maybe some kind of signal?<br />I don't know.
553583 554885 What are you gonna do with it?
556220 559122 I'm gonna give it something<br />socially responsible to do,
559156 561091 (PANTING)<br />like drive a combine.
561858 563193 Can't we just let it go?
565662 567131 It wasn't hurting anybody.
569098 571735 This thing needs to learn<br />how to adapt, Murph,
571768 573137 like the rest of us.
578208 579619 COOPER: So how's this work?<br />You guys come with?
579643 581278 TOM: I've got class.
581311 583313 This one needs to wait.
585182 586349 What did you do?
586382 587894 They'll tell you about it<br />when you get in there.
587918 589185 Am I gonna be mad?
589219 590420 Not with me.
590453 591788 Just please try not to.
591822 593322 Hey, relax.
594858 596160 I got this.
600530 602199 Little late, Coop.
602232 603900 Yeah, we had a flat.
603934 605568 And I guess you had to stop off
605602 607704 at the Asian<br />fighter plane store.
607738 611374 No, actually, sir, that's a...<br />That's a surveillance drone.
611407 613911 With outstanding solar cells.<br />It's Indian.
614478 615579 Take a seat.
616813 618248 So, uh...
619116 622318 We got Tom's scores back.
622352 624888 He's going to make<br />an excellent farmer.
624921 628224 Yeah, he's got<br />a knack for it.<br />What about college?
628258 630694 Well, the university<br />only takes a handful.
630727 631871 They don't really have<br />the resources to...
631895 634297 I still pay my taxes.
634330 637000 Where's that money go?<br />There's no more armies.
637033 640003 Well, it doesn't go<br />to the university.
640036 641871 Look, Coop,<br />you have to be realistic.
641905 644274 You're ruling my son out<br />for college now?
644875 646275 The kid's 15.
646309 648312 Tom's score simply<br />isn't high enough.
649713 651448 What's your waistline?<br />About 32?
651948 653983 About a 33 inseam?
654016 655885 I'm not sure I see<br />what you're getting at.
655918 656996 You're telling me<br />it takes two numbers
657020 658288 to measure your own ass,
658321 660157 but only one to measure<br />my son's future?
660691 662659 (SIGHS) Come on.
662693 664594 You're a well-educated man,<br />Coop.
664628 665863 And a trained pilot.
665864 667097 And an engineer.
667130 672302 Okay, well, right now<br />we don't need<br />more engineers.
672335 674838 We didn't run out of<br />television screens<br />and planes.
674871 676973 We ran out of food.
677007 680077 The world needs farmers.<br />Good farmers, like you.
680110 681378 And Tom.
681411 682412 Uneducated farmers.
683780 685748 We're a caretaker<br />generation, Coop.
685781 687817 And things are getting better.
687851 689429 Maybe your grandkids<br />will get to be engineers...
689453 690520 Are we done here, sir?
692088 693123 No.
694057 696960 Ms. Hanley's here<br />to talk about Murph.
696993 699495 MS. HANLEY: Murph is a great<br />kid. She's really bright.
699529 701963 But she's been having<br />a little trouble lately.
701998 703676 She brought this in<br />to show the other students.
703700 705268 The section<br />on the lunar landings.
705301 708204 Yeah, it's one<br />of my old textbooks.
708237 710540 She always loved the pictures.
710573 711975 It's an old federal textbook.
712008 714210 We've replaced them<br />with the corrected versions.
714243 715978 Corrected?
716012 717747 Explaining how<br />the Apollo missions<br />were faked
717780 719416 to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
726389 728158 You don't believe<br />we went to the moon?
729626 731995 I believe it was a brilliant<br />piece of propaganda.
732028 734397 That the Soviets bankrupted<br />themselves pouring resources
734430 736900 into rockets<br />and other useless machines.
736933 738301 "Useless machines."
738334 740136 And if we don't want<br />a repeat of the excess
740170 742806 and wastefulness<br />of the 20th century, then
742839 744641 we need to teach our kids<br />about this planet,
744674 746143 not tales of leaving it.
747210 748778 You know, one of those<br />useless machines
748812 751681 they used to make<br />was called an MRI.
751715 753416 And if we had any of those left,
753449 754951 the doctors would've<br />been able to find
754984 756787 the cyst in my wife's brain
756820 759089 before she died<br />instead of afterwards.
759122 760333 And then she'd have been<br />the one sitting here,
760357 762192 listening to this instead of me,
762225 763536 which would have<br />been a good thing,
763560 765095 'cause she was always
765829 767197 the calmer one.
768131 769967 I'm sorry about your wife,<br />Mr. Cooper.
771601 773803 But Murph got into a fistfight
773836 775081 with several of<br />her classmates over this
775105 777039 Apollo nonsense.
777073 778117 So we thought it would be best
778141 779543 to bring you in<br />and see what ideas
779576 781020 you might have for<br />dealing with her behavior
781044 782078 on the homefront.
782111 783645 All right. (INHALES)
783680 786949 Yeah, you know what? Um...<br />There's a game tomorrow night.
786983 789285 She's going through<br />a bit of a baseball phase.
789319 791364 Her favorite team is playing,<br />and there's gonna be candy
791388 793090 and soda...
796258 798028 I think I'll take her to that.
801431 802466 (WHISTLING)
803433 804500 How'd it go?
805601 807970 I got you suspended.
808004 809284 - What?<br />- BOOTS ON RADIO: Cooper.
810973 812509 This is Cooper, go.
812542 815311 Coop, those combines<br />you rebuilt went haywire.
815344 818115 Uh, just reset the controllers.
818148 820283 I did that.<br />You should<br />come take a look.
840603 842415 BOOTS: One by one they've been<br />peeling off the fields
842439 843607 and heading over.
843640 845308 Something's interfering<br />with the compass.
846976 849212 Magnetism or some such.
867597 868598 (CLATTERING)
892455 894255 YOUNG MURPH: Nothing special<br />about which book.
894657 896593 I've been working on it,<br />like you said.
897661 898728 I counted the spaces.
898761 899796 Why?
902332 904012 In case the ghost<br />is trying to communicate.
904934 906336 I'm trying Morse.
906936 908205 Morse?
908605 910139 Yeah.
910173 911474 Dots and dashes, used...
911507 913075 I know what<br />Morse code is, Murph.
913109 914543 I just don't think<br />your bookshelf's
914578 915645 trying to talk to you.
927590 930093 COOPER: Had to reset every<br />compass clock and GPS
930126 932028 to offset for the anomaly.
932061 933463 DONALD: Which is?
933497 934498 I don't know.
936499 938935 If the house was built<br />on magnetic ore,
938969 940179 we'd have seen this<br />the first time
940203 941638 we switched on the tractor.
944707 947777 I hear your meeting at<br />the school didn't go so well.
947810 949779 (SCOFFS) You heard?
951280 953617 It's like we've forgotten<br />who we are, Donald.
955552 958721 Explorers, pioneers,<br />not caretakers.
960723 962224 When I was a kid,
962258 963727 it felt like they made
963760 965327 something new every day.
965361 968997 Some gadget or idea.
969031 970767 Like every day was Christmas.
970800 973270 But six billion people...
973869 975605 Just try to imagine that.
977107 979609 And every last one of them<br />trying to have it all.
981644 983044 (SIGHS)
983079 984814 This world isn't so bad.
987316 989418 And Tom will do just fine.
989452 991386 You're the one<br />who doesn't belong.
991420 993823 Born 40 years too late,<br />or 40 years too early.
995157 997427 My daughter knew it,<br />God bless her.
998594 1001731 And your kids know it.<br />Especially Murph.
1001764 1005168 Well, we used to look up<br />in the sky and wonder
1005201 1007404 at our place in the stars.
1009973 1011641 Now we just look down
1011674 1014978 and worry about<br />our place in the dirt.
1015011 1018248 Cooper,<br />you were good at something
1018281 1020383 and you never got a chance<br />to do anything with it.
1021117 1022452 I'm sorry.
1024654 1029058 You didn't expect this dirt<br />that was giving you this food
1029091 1032395 to turn on you like that<br />and destroy you.
1032428 1036866 In April, I believe I'm right,<br />15th of April, I think.
1036900 1039602 'Cause this happened<br />about 1:30, when that thing
1039635 1041971 came off the top of that canyon.
1042005 1043239 (CROWD CHEERING)
1043271 1044907 In my day,<br />we had real ballplayers.
1045441 1047610 Who are these bums?
1047643 1050246 COOPER: Well, in my day,<br />people were too busy
1050279 1052615 fighting over food<br />to even play baseball.
1052649 1055619 Popcorn at a ballgame<br />is unnatural.
1055652 1057654 I want a hot dog.
1057687 1059589 School says you're gonna<br />follow in my footsteps.
1060556 1062258 - I think that's great.<br />- (SCOFFS)
1062291 1063958 You think that's great?
1063993 1065427 You hate farming, Dad.
1066262 1067496 Grandpa said.
1067964 1070200 Grandpa said, huh?
1070233 1072769 Listen, all that matters is<br />how you feel about it.
1072802 1074304 I like what you do.
1075038 1076406 I like our farm.
1077306 1078351 You're gonna be great at it.
1078375 1079608 (CROWD CHEERING)
1087083 1088652 (SIREN BLARING)
1091788 1092955 Let's get out of here.
1100496 1102365 COOPER:<br />All right, it's a doozy.
1103232 1104801 Uh, gang, let's mask up.
1108438 1110307 - Tom? Murph? Check?<br />- CHILDREN: Yep.
1163926 1166129 Murph, Tom,<br />you guys shut your windows?
1170700 1171735 Murph!
1193222 1194456 YOUNG MURPH: The ghost.
1195958 1197093 Grab your pillow.
1198227 1199796 You're sleeping in with Tom.
1254950 1256453 It's not a ghost.
1262091 1263131 (WHISPERING) It's gravity.
1265795 1268097 DONALD: I'm dropping Tom,<br />then heading to town.
1268130 1270266 You want to clean that up
1270299 1271968 when you're finished<br />praying to it?
1297627 1299662 It's not Morse, Murph.<br />It's binary.
1300363 1302165 Thick is one, thin is zero.
1306903 1308004 Coordinates.
1310773 1311774 Nope.
1312141 1313243 Mmm-mmm.
1314577 1315778 Here we go.
1317446 1318715 Thirty-three.
1321917 1322919 That's it.
1324186 1326021 - I can't miss this!<br />- (SIGHS)
1326054 1328892 Grandpa will be back<br />in a couple hours, Murph.
1329992 1332295 But you don't know<br />what you're gonna find.
1333429 1334764 And that
1336132 1337901 is why I can't take you.
1344107 1345108 Murph?
1347510 1348787 Grandpa will be home in a while.
1348811 1350747 Tell him I'll call him<br />on the radio.
1356986 1358021 - (YELPS)<br />- Jeez!
1359221 1360256 What are you doing?
1360289 1361557 (LAUGHING)
1361590 1363892 Oh, you think<br />this is funny?<br />Huh?
1363926 1365962 You wouldn't be here<br />if it wasn't for me.
1368097 1369131 Make yourself useful.
1369164 1370166 (CONTINUES LAUGHING)
1433429 1434631 (SOFTLY) Hey, Murph?
1436299 1437333 Murph!
1441037 1443039 I think this is<br />the end of the road.
1446475 1448111 Didn't you bring<br />the bolt cutters?
1449378 1450413 That's my girl.
1478408 1480151 - MALE GUARD: Step away from the fence!<br />- No, no, no.
1480175 1481743 Don't shoot! Don't shoot!<br />I'm not armed.
1481777 1483212 My daughter's in the car.
1483245 1484880 (TASING)
1484913 1486233 (MECHANICAL FOOTSTEPS<br />APPROACHING)
1489084 1490724 - MALE GUARD: Don't be afraid.<br />- (SCREAMS)
1503532 1505234 TARS: How did you<br />find this place?
1506235 1508004 Where's my daughter?
1508037 1509347 TARS: You had<br />the coordinates<br />for this facility
1509371 1510672 marked on your map.
1510706 1511950 Where did you get<br />those coordinates?
1511974 1513408 (SHOUTING)<br />Where's my daughter?
1513443 1514619 Don't make me<br />take you down again.
1514643 1516879 Sit down!
1516912 1519015 Oh, you still think<br />you're a Marine, pal?
1519048 1522050 Marines don't exist anymore.
1522084 1525421 And I got grunts like you<br />mowing my grass.
1525455 1527155 Where did you find<br />those coordinates?
1527189 1530092 But you don't look<br />much like a lawnmower.
1530125 1532762 Think I'll turn you into an<br />overqualified vacuum cleaner.
1532795 1533996 WOMAN: No, you won't.
1535764 1537333 TARS, back down, please.
1539334 1542939 You know, you're taking a risk<br />using ex-military as security.
1542972 1546775 They're old,<br />and their control units<br />are unpredictable.
1546808 1548411 It's what the government<br />could spare.
1549011 1550311 (PANTING)
1550346 1551447 Who are you?
1552014 1553783 Dr. Brand.
1553816 1556352 I knew a Dr. Brand once.<br />He was a professor.
1556385 1558454 What makes you think I'm not?
1558487 1560323 Oh, wasn't near as cute, either.
1560789 1562023 Please, Dr. Brand.
1562058 1563418 I don't have<br />any idea what this is.
1564460 1566796 Now I'm scared for<br />my daughter and<br />I want her by my side.
1566829 1568096 You give me that,
1568130 1569690 I'll tell you anything<br />you want to know.
1572635 1573970 Get the principals
1574003 1575723 and the girl in<br />the conference room, please.
1576939 1578241 Your daughter is fine.
1578741 1579876 Bright kid.
1580576 1582712 Must have a very smart mother.
1582745 1585314 It's pretty clear<br />you don't want any visitors.
1585348 1586958 So why don't you<br />just let us back up<br />from your fence
1586982 1589351 and we'll be on our way? Huh?
1589385 1590619 It's not that simple.
1590653 1592154 Well, sure, it is.
1592187 1593822 I don't know anything about you.
1593855 1595791 I don't know<br />anything about this place.
1596659 1597860 Yes, you do.
1603532 1604532 Dad!
1607402 1608402 Hello, Cooper.
1609906 1610906 Professor Brand.
1612809 1615277 WILLIAMS: Explain to me<br />how you found this facility.
1615310 1617111 Kind of an accident.<br />We stumbled upon it.
1617146 1618981 We were on a salvage run...
1619014 1621784 You're sitting in the<br />best-kept secret in the world.
1621817 1625621 Nobody stumbles in here.<br />Nobody stumbles out.
1625654 1626974 PROFESSOR BRAND:<br />Cooper... Please.
1627656 1629457 Cooperate with these people.
1629492 1630492 Look.
1631993 1634129 It's kind of hard to explain.
1634163 1638000 We learned these coordinates<br />from an anomaly.
1638768 1640302 What sort of anomaly?
1640336 1642338 I hesitate to<br />term it supernatural,
1642371 1643982 (CHUCKLES) but it definitely<br />wasn't scientific.
1644006 1646408 You're going to have to be<br />specific, Mr. Cooper.
1646441 1647743 Right now.
1647777 1648945 It was gravity.
1652448 1653448 DOYLE: Um...
1654216 1655818 What sort of<br />gravitational anomaly?
1655851 1657286 - Where was this?<br />- COOPER: Hey.
1657319 1658486 Now I'm real happy
1658520 1660889 'cause you're excited<br />about gravity, bud,
1660923 1662334 but you're not getting<br />any answers from us
1662358 1663559 until I get assurances.
1663592 1665094 - Assurances?<br />- Yeah.
1666195 1667963 Like that we're<br />getting out of here.
1667996 1669636 And I don't mean<br />in the trunk of some car.
1669665 1671166 (ALL LAUGHING)
1672134 1674435 Don't you know who we are, Coop?
1674469 1675971 No, Professor, I don't.
1676005 1677685 BRAND: You know my father,<br />Professor Brand.
1678440 1679508 We're NASA.
1681477 1682711 NASA?
1682745 1684045 PROFESSOR BRAND: NASA.
1684079 1685647 The same NASA you flew for.
1697125 1698926 COOPER: I heard<br />they shut you down, sir,
1698961 1701063 for refusing to drop bombs<br />from the stratosphere
1701097 1703165 onto starving people.
1703199 1705601 When they realized that<br />killing other people was
1705635 1708671 not a long-term solution,<br />then they needed us back.
1708704 1709805 In secret.
1709806 1710906 Why secret?
1710939 1712641 Because public opinion<br />wouldn't allow
1712674 1715077 spending on space exploration.
1715110 1717150 Not when you're struggling<br />to put food on the table.
1718580 1720349 Blight.
1720382 1724020 Wheat seven years ago.<br />Okra this year.
1724953 1727156 Now there's just corn.
1727189 1729090 And we're growing<br />more than we ever have.
1729124 1731226 But like the potatoes in Ireland
1731260 1733061 and the wheat in the Dust Bowl,
1733762 1736165 the corn will die.
1736899 1738034 Soon.
1743873 1748110 We'll find a way, Professor.<br />We always have.
1748143 1751579 Driven by the unshakeable<br />faith the Earth is ours.
1752448 1754150 Well, not just ours, no.
1754816 1756185 But it is our home.
1757887 1761190 Earth's atmosphere<br />is 80% nitrogen.
1761223 1762991 We don't even breathe nitrogen.
1763024 1765327 Blight does.<br />And as it thrives,
1765360 1768597 our air gets<br />less and less oxygen.
1768630 1770065 The last people to starve
1770099 1772233 will be the first to suffocate.
1772267 1774203 And your daughter's generation
1776105 1778373 will be the last<br />to survive on Earth.
1778406 1780175 BRAND: Murph is feeling<br />a little tired.
1780209 1782289 I was wondering if she could<br />take a nap in my office.
1782445 1783646 Yeah. Thank you.
1786582 1787583 Okay.
1788817 1790152 Now you need to tell me
1790186 1793021 what your plan is<br />to save the world.
1793055 1795123 We're not meant<br />to save the world.
1795157 1796325 We're meant to leave it.
1802365 1803799 COOPER: Rangers.
1803833 1805210 PROFESSOR BRAND:<br />The last components
1805234 1808870 of our one versatile ship<br />in orbit, the Endurance.
1808904 1810373 Our final expedition.
1811440 1814110 You sent people out there<br />looking for a new home?
1814910 1816645 The Lazarus missions.
1816678 1817879 Oh, that sounds cheerful.
1817913 1819982 Lazarus came back from the dead.
1820015 1821695 Sure, but he had to die<br />in the first place.
1822484 1824053 There's not a planet<br />in our solar system
1824086 1825520 that could sustain life
1825554 1828223 and the nearest star's<br />over 1,000 years away.
1828257 1830493 And that doesn't even<br />qualify as futile.
1832260 1833462 Where'd you send 'em?
1833962 1835897 Cooper,
1835931 1838567 I can't tell you any more<br />unless you agree
1838600 1840836 to pilot this craft.
1840870 1842270 You're the best pilot<br />we ever had.
1842304 1844272 I barely left the stratosphere.
1844306 1846541 This team never<br />left the simulator.
1846575 1848077 We need a pilot,
1848110 1850679 and this is the mission<br />that you were trained for.
1850712 1851814 Without even knowing it?
1853382 1855617 An hour ago, you didn't even<br />know I was alive.
1855651 1857253 You were going anyway.
1857719 1859721 We had no choice.
1859755 1861223 But something sent you here.
1861657 1862924 They chose you.
1862958 1864126 Who's "they"?
1872300 1873836 How long would I be gone?
1874803 1876105 Hard to know.
1876572 1877573 Years?
1878374 1879708 I've got kids, Professor.
1880776 1882378 Get out there and save them.
1885981 1887683 Who's "they"?
1887716 1889985 We started detecting<br />gravitational anomalies
1890018 1891920 almost 50 years ago.
1891954 1893888 Mostly small distortions<br />to our instruments
1893922 1895557 in the upper atmosphere.
1895591 1898461 In fact, I believe<br />you encountered one yourself.
1899261 1901196 Yeah, over the Straits.
1902130 1903432 My crash.
1903465 1904800 Something tripped<br />my fly-by-wire.
1905367 1906534 Exactly.
1907770 1912441 But of all these anomalies,<br />the most significant is this.
1912475 1913475 Out near Saturn,
1914910 1916679 a disturbance of spacetime.
1918880 1920682 Is that a wormhole?
1920715 1922217 It appeared 48 years ago.
1922250 1924320 And it leads where?
1924920 1926489 Another galaxy.
1928390 1930759 A wormhole's not a naturally<br />occurring phenomenon.
1930792 1931861 Someone placed it there.
1933028 1934996 - "They"?<br />- Mmm-hmm.
1935030 1936965 And whoever they are,
1936999 1939501 they appear to be<br />looking out for us.
1939534 1942337 That wormhole<br />lets us travel<br />to other stars.
1942371 1944406 It came along<br />right as we needed it.
1944440 1946008 They've put potentially<br />habitable worlds
1946041 1947541 right within our reach.
1947575 1949912 Twelve, in fact,<br />from our initial probes.
1949945 1951063 You sent probes into that?
1951064 1952181 Mmm-hmm.
1952214 1954849 We sent people into it.<br />Ten years ago.
1956385 1958520 The Lazarus missions.
1958553 1960121 PROFESSOR BRAND:<br />Twelve possible worlds,
1960155 1961790 12 Ranger launches carrying
1962825 1965260 the bravest humans ever to live,
1965294 1968163 led by the remarkable<br />Dr. Mann.
1968197 1969598 Each person's landing pod
1969631 1971533 had enough life support<br />for two years.
1971567 1973535 But they could<br />use hibernation<br />to stretch that,
1973569 1975369 making observations on organics
1975404 1977071 over a decade or more.
1977105 1979307 Their mission was<br />to assess their world,
1979341 1981176 and if it showed potential,
1981209 1982778 then they could<br />send out a signal,
1982811 1985680 bed down for the long nap,<br />wait to be rescued.
1985713 1987616 And what if the world<br />didn't show promise?
1988317 1989585 Hence the bravery.
1990752 1992887 You don't have the resources<br />to visit all 12.
1993388 1994388 No.
1995658 1998394 Data transmission back through<br />the wormhole is rudimentary.
1998427 2000562 Simple binary pings<br />on an annual basis
2000596 2003499 give us some clue as to<br />which worlds have potential.
2003532 2005767 And one system shows promise.
2005801 2007970 One. That's a bit of<br />a long shot, isn't it?
2009204 2012273 One system with<br />three potential worlds?
2012307 2013709 (CHUCKLES)<br />No long shot.
2015944 2016944 Okay.
2017946 2019982 So if we find a home,
2022817 2024053 then what?
2024086 2025921 That's the long shot.
2026621 2030458 There's a Plan A and a Plan B.
2030491 2032060 Did you notice anything strange
2032093 2033093 about the launch chamber?
2045307 2048410 COOPER: This entire facility's<br />a centrifuge.
2048443 2051013 Some kind of vehicle.<br />A space station?
2051046 2053181 PROFESSOR BRAND: Both. Plan A.
2053214 2055484 How do you get it<br />off the ground?
2055517 2059521 The first gravitational<br />anomalies changed everything.
2059553 2064057 Suddenly we knew that<br />harnessing gravity was real.
2064091 2066628 So I started working on a theory
2066662 2069097 and we started<br />building this station.
2069131 2070899 But you haven't solved it yet.
2072267 2073569 That's why there's Plan B.
2074301 2076370 The problem is gravity.
2076404 2079074 How to get a viable amount of<br />human life off the planet.
2079108 2080841 This is one way.
2080875 2083445 Plan B: a population bomb.
2083477 2086080 Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
2086115 2088283 weighing in at<br />just under 900 kilos.
2089151 2090886 Well, how would you raise 'em?
2090919 2093354 With equipment on board,<br />we incubate the first 10.
2093388 2095390 After that, with surrogacy,
2095423 2096992 the growth becomes exponential.
2097960 2099494 Within 30 years,
2099528 2101363 we could have<br />a colony of hundreds.
2101396 2103164 The real difficulty<br />with colonization
2103198 2104466 is genetic diversity.
2105300 2107536 This takes care of that.
2107569 2109471 But what about<br />the people here?<br />You just...
2110005 2111073 You give up on 'em?
2111873 2112941 My kids?
2114109 2116945 That's why Plan A<br />is a lot more fun.
2119348 2120949 How far have you got?
2120982 2122350 Almost there.
2122384 2124620 You're asking me<br />to hang everything
2125887 2127556 on an almost.
2127589 2129758 I'm asking you to trust me.
2131726 2133061 (SIGHS)
2133094 2134595 Find us a new home.
2135530 2138266 And by the time you return,
2138300 2140568 I will have solved<br />the problem of gravity.
2141770 2143105 I give you my word.
2155984 2157119 YOUNG MURPH: Go away!
2165293 2166628 (SIGHING)
2168030 2169464 Murph.
2169497 2172368 Go! If you're leaving,<br />just go.
2175637 2177940 DONALD: This world was never<br />enough for you, was it, Coop?
2179074 2180608 What, because heading out there
2180642 2182611 is what I feel like<br />I was born to do?
2183545 2185380 And it excites me?
2186381 2188817 No, that does not make it wrong.
2188850 2190619 DONALD: It might.
2190652 2193155 Don't trust the right thing<br />done for the wrong reason.
2194489 2196591 The why of the thing,<br />that's the foundation.
2196624 2198627 And the foundation's solid.
2202263 2204432 We farmers,<br />we sit here every year
2204466 2207101 when the rains fail and we say,
2207135 2208170 "Next year."
2209404 2211006 Well, next year<br />ain't gonna save us,
2211039 2212674 nor the one after that.
2213575 2215077 This world's a treasure, Donald,
2215110 2217646 but it's been telling us<br />to leave for a while now.
2222550 2224318 Mankind was born on Earth,
2224352 2226121 it was never meant to die here.
2229458 2230825 Tom will be all right,
2230858 2232728 but you got to<br />make things right<br />with Murph.
2232761 2233762 I will.
2235063 2237865 Without making promises<br />you don't know you can keep.
2248643 2250546 You have to talk to me, Murph.
2253247 2255650 I need to fix this before I go.
2255684 2258086 Then I'll keep it broken<br />so you have to stay.
2260222 2262524 After you kids came along,<br />your mom,
2262557 2264827 she said something to me<br />I never quite understood.
2265260 2266829 She said, "Now,
2268930 2273101 "we're just here to be<br />memories for our kids."
2278740 2280809 And I think now I understand<br />what she meant.
2284679 2285912 Once you're a parent,
2285947 2288217 you're the ghost<br />of your children's future.
2289751 2291854 (SNIFFLES) You said<br />ghosts didn't exist.
2298693 2300028 That's right, Murph.
2303398 2304666 Murph, look at me.
2307835 2310038 I can't be your ghost right now.
2312174 2313942 I need to exist.
2315610 2317579 They chose me.
2318413 2319947 Murph, they chose me.
2319981 2322117 You saw. You're the one<br />who led me to 'em.
2324986 2327222 That's exactly why you can't go.
2330792 2333161 I figured out the message.
2333194 2335597 One word. Know what it is?
2336464 2337766 "Stay."
2338300 2339568 It says, "Stay," Dad.
2339601 2340736 (WHISPERS) Murph.
2341603 2343704 You don't believe me.
2343738 2346674 Look at the books!<br />Look at this. It says, "Stay."
2346708 2349311 Why... You're not listening!<br />It says, "Stay!"
2350078 2351879 No, I'm coming back.
2351913 2353081 When?
2356818 2357920 (SNIFFLES)
2358953 2360322 (KISSES)
2366428 2369597 One for you, one for me.
2369631 2372834 When I'm up there<br />in hypersleep, or...<br />(SNIFFLES)
2372868 2375070 Or traveling<br />near the speed of light,
2376338 2379007 or near a black hole,
2379040 2383145 time's gonna change for me.<br />It's gonna run more slowly.
2385046 2386682 When we get back,
2387816 2389617 we're gonna compare.
2389650 2391062 YOUNG MURPH: Time will<br />run differently for us?
2391086 2392086 (WHISPERS) Yeah.
2393121 2394555 By the time I get back,
2394589 2397726 we might even be<br />the same age, you and me.
2398326 2400329 "What?" Imagine that!
2405133 2406635 Aw, Murph...
2406668 2408936 You have no idea<br />when you're coming back.
2410906 2412174 - No idea at all!<br />- (CLATTERS)
2412841 2414376 - Murphy...<br />- (SOBBING)
2415710 2417645 Murph, don't make me<br />leave like this.
2417679 2419780 Come on, Murph!
2419814 2421917 Don't make me leave<br />like this, Murph!
2425519 2427122 (YOUNG MURPH<br />CONTINUES SOBBING)
2429958 2431258 Hey...
2431293 2433094 I love you.
2433128 2435662 Forever. You hear me?
2435697 2438400 I love you forever.<br />And I'm coming back.
2444372 2445774 I'm coming back.
2464058 2465326 How'd it go?
2465360 2466427 COOPER: It went fine.
2466460 2467763 Just fine.
2475103 2476103 I love you, Tom.
2476704 2477721 Travel safe, yeah?
2477722 2478738 Yeah.
2478773 2480453 You look after our place<br />for me, all right?
2481175 2482175 - All right?<br />- Uh-huh.
2487682 2489093 Hey, can I use your truck<br />while you're gone?
2489117 2490786 You mean your truck?
2492053 2493889 I'll make sure<br />they bring it back.
2494756 2495957 (ENGINE STARTS)
2495991 2497793 Look after my kids, Donald!
2510672 2512240 TARS: Go for<br />main engine start.
2512273 2513909 T minus 10...
2514542 2515643 Dad!
2515676 2516878 Nine...
2516911 2518046 Dad!
2518780 2519781 Eight,
2521316 2522283 seven...
2522316 2523452 Dad!
2524019 2525019 Six,
2526521 2529157 five, main engine start, four,
2530591 2531793 three,
2532360 2533360 two,
2534696 2536364 one. Booster ignition and...
2537331 2538365 Lift off.
2545840 2547976 All engines look good.<br />Beginning roll program.
2552713 2555217 Prepare for<br />stage one separation.
2555649 2556649 Stage one.
2562657 2564359 There is Mach 1.
2565494 2566928 Everybody good?
2566962 2569131 Plenty of slaves<br />for my robot colony?
2571099 2572767 They gave him a humor setting,
2572800 2574736 so he'd fit in better<br />with his unit.
2574769 2576604 He thinks it relaxes us.
2576638 2579207 A giant sarcastic robot.
2580341 2581910 What a great idea!
2581943 2583019 TARS: I have a cue light<br />I can use
2583043 2584546 when I'm joking if you like.
2584579 2586113 That'd probably help.
2586147 2587825 Yeah, you can use it to find<br />your way back into the ship
2587849 2589351 after I blow you<br />out the airlock.
2590918 2592420 What's your humor setting, TARS?
2592454 2593955 That's 100%.
2593988 2596390 Let's bring it on down<br />to 75, please.
2596424 2597959 TARS: Stage two separation.
2608837 2611239 COOPER:<br />All feeds going manual.
2611272 2612340 DOYLE: Going manual.
2615076 2616653 Deactivate probe heater<br />one, two and three.
2616677 2617845 DOYLE: Check.
2623785 2625053 Taking control.
2625086 2626421 TARS: This is handover to you.
2630792 2631793 DOYLE: ADF check.
2631826 2633428 COOPER: Over.
2633461 2637131 Pull thrusters back.<br />Fuel cells one,<br />two, three.
2637165 2638500 DOYLE: 100%.
2638533 2639601 COOPER: Ex-mites.
2649611 2651112 It's hard leaving everything.
2651646 2655016 My kids. Your father.
2655049 2657352 We're going to be spending<br />a lot of time together.
2657385 2658786 We should learn to talk.
2658820 2660155 And when not to.
2662490 2664359 Just being honest.
2664392 2667062 I don't think<br />you need to be that honest.
2667095 2669130 Hey, TARS, what's<br />your honesty parameter?
2669563 2670664 90%.
2670698 2672400 90%?
2672433 2675637 Absolute honesty isn't<br />always the most diplomatic,
2675670 2677972 nor the safest form<br />of communication<br />with emotional beings.
2678373 2679507 Okay.
2680108 2682577 90% it is, Dr. Brand.
2686781 2688316 We are coming up<br />on the Endurance.
2688349 2689517 Twelve minutes out.
2706901 2708670 Okay. Taking control.
2712707 2715176 Approaching module port,<br />500 meters.
2728122 2729224 It's all you, Doyle.
2748043 2750245 Nice and easy, Doyle.<br />Nice and easy.
2755616 2756951 I'm feeling good.
2756984 2758119 Take us home.
2765760 2767128 Lock?
2767162 2768729 - Target locked.<br />- DOYLE: Target locked.
2768763 2770464 - COOPER: Well done.<br />- Okay, helmets on.
2770497 2771497 Good job.
2804966 2806734 Door's not charging.
2806768 2808236 Never mind.
2831325 2832627 Cooper, you should have control.
2833094 2834496 Control here.
2836230 2838533 Communication with<br />ring module active.
2845506 2846541 (WHISPERS) Oh, wow.
2852613 2853613 TARS: That's initiate.
2859954 2861255 (BRAND SIGHS)
2861288 2862524 COOPER: Are we ready to spin?
2862557 2863557 BRAND: Just a sec.
2875102 2876470 TARS: Hello, CASE.
2876504 2877504 Hello, TARS.
2878406 2880275 All right, we're all set.
2880841 2882243 Let's do it.
2900928 2902230 (CHUCKLES)
2911639 2912640 COOPER: 30% of spin.
2919613 2920748 One G.
2921816 2923618 How's gravity<br />treating you back there?
2924052 2925253 Well.
2928656 2930591 Romilly? Hey, you okay?
2930625 2932126 - Yeah.<br />- You all right?
2932160 2934529 Mmm. Yeah,<br />I just need a minute.
2934562 2936173 BRAND: Okay, I think<br />we have some Dramamine<br />in the hab pod.
2936197 2937731 I'm just gonna go get that.
2937765 2938942 Might be in<br />the cryo-beds.<br />I'll just be a sec.
2938966 2940067 Hey, Brand?
2940101 2941669 Yeah?
2941703 2942770 - Bring a lot.<br />- (LAUGHS)
2952113 2955149 Amelia... Be safe.
2955183 2956817 Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
2956851 2958719 I will, Dad.
2958753 2961088 It looks good<br />for your trajectory.
2961122 2963925 We've calculated<br />two years to Saturn.
2964859 2966327 That's a lot of Dramamine.
2967361 2970298 Look after my family,<br />will you, please, sir?
2970331 2973467 We'll be waiting for you<br />when you get back.
2973500 2975870 A little older, a little wiser,
2975903 2977205 but happy to see you.
2980274 2984245 "Do not go gentle<br />into that good night
2984278 2987916 "Old age should burn and rave<br />at close of day
2989550 2994189 "Rage, rage against<br />the dying of the light
2995456 2999459 "Though wise men at their end<br />know dark is right
2999493 3002663 "Because their words had<br />forked no lightning they
3002696 3005867 "Do not go gentle<br />into that good night
3006901 3010905 "Rage, rage against<br />the dying of the light"
3027822 3029622 - DOYLE: (WHISPERS) You good?<br />- ROMILLY: Yeah.
3030324 3031659 - Okay.<br />- Thank you, sir.
3035229 3036531 Here. Pills.
3039500 3041402 So alone.
3041436 3043571 We have each other.<br />Dr. Mann had it worse.
3043605 3044805 No, I mean them.
3044838 3046240 Hmm?
3046274 3047641 COOPER: It's a perfect planet,
3047675 3050378 and we're not gonna<br />find another one like her.
3050411 3053248 No, it's not like<br />looking for a new condo.
3054548 3056551 The human race is going to be
3056951 3058552 adrift,
3058586 3060354 desperate for a rock<br />it can cling to
3060387 3061722 while it catches its breath.
3062456 3064758 We need to find that rock.
3064792 3067461 And our three prospects<br />are at the edge of what
3067494 3070097 might sustain human life.
3070130 3072599 Laura Miller's planet is first.
3072633 3073968 Laura started<br />our biology program.
3074002 3075002 COOPER: Mmm-hmm.
3079974 3081408 BRAND: Uh,<br />Wolf Edmunds is here.
3081442 3082677 Tell me about Edmunds.
3083878 3086347 Oh, uh...<br />Wolf's a particle physicist.
3088916 3090852 None of them had families, huh?
3092352 3095189 No. No attachments.<br />My father insisted.
3095222 3097057 They all knew the odds against
3097091 3098892 ever seeing<br />another human being again.
3098926 3100894 I'm hoping we can surprise<br />at least three of them.
3100928 3101963 How about Mann?
3101964 3102997 Dr. Mann?
3103030 3105232 Well, he's remarkable.<br />He's the best of us.
3105266 3107601 He inspired 11 people<br />to follow him
3107635 3109737 on the loneliest journey<br />in human history.
3109771 3111305 Scientists, explorers.
3111339 3113374 That's what I love.
3113407 3115410 You know, out there<br />we face great odds.
3115943 3117078 Death, but...
3119079 3120715 Not evil.
3120748 3123050 You don't think<br />nature can be evil?
3123084 3125453 No. Formidable.<br />Frightening. But...
3126253 3127689 No, not evil.
3129990 3133461 Well, is a lion evil because<br />it rips a gazelle to shreds?
3133494 3135095 Just what we take<br />with us, is that it?
3135830 3136830 Yeah.
3137698 3139400 This crew represents<br />the best of humanity.
3139433 3141168 Even me, huh?
3141201 3143137 You know what?<br />We agreed, 90%.
3143170 3144170 There you go.
3144772 3146006 Don't stay up.
3146040 3147241 I'll be there in a minute.
3147274 3149277 Just remember, Coop,
3149310 3151045 you are literally<br />wasting your breath.
3157985 3159519 COOPER: Hey, TARS?
3159553 3161455 Let's go over that trajectory<br />one more time.
3161489 3163657 TARS: Eight months to Mars.
3163690 3165726 Counter-orbital<br />slingshot around.
3165760 3168295 Fourteen months to Saturn.<br />Nothing's changed on that.
3168328 3169997 Just let me ask you something.
3172633 3173910 (WHISPERING)<br />Dr. Brand and Edmunds...
3173934 3175894 TARS: Why are you whispering?<br />They can't hear you.
3177605 3179106 (NORMAL VOICE)<br />Dr. Brand and Edmunds.
3179140 3180508 They close?
3180541 3182176 I wouldn't know.
3182209 3185345 Is that 90% "wouldn't know"<br />or 10% "wouldn't know"?
3185379 3187081 I also have<br />a discretion setting, Cooper.
3187114 3188383 Oh.
3190084 3191886 But not a poker face, Slick.
3204297 3205566 Hey, guys.
3206667 3209603 Dad's about to go down<br />for the long nap.
3209636 3212272 So I wanted to<br />give you an update.
3212305 3214275 Uh...
3214308 3216644 The Earth looks<br />amazing from here.
3216677 3218345 Um...
3218379 3220114 You can't see any of the dust.
3220147 3221449 (CHUCKLES)
3222716 3225786 I really hope<br />you guys are doing great.
3225819 3227259 I know you're gonna<br />get this message.
3227287 3229791 Professor Brand's assured me<br />that he's gonna get it to you.
3230524 3232193 Know that I love you.
3234027 3235329 Is it him?
3235362 3236602 DONALD:<br />I don't think so, Murph.
3243203 3244705 You must be Donald.
3247007 3248007 Hello, Murph.
3249176 3250812 Why are you in my dad's truck?
3251746 3253648 He wanted me<br />to bring it for your brother.
3254482 3256584 He sent you a message.
3259920 3262055 She's pretty upset<br />with him for leaving.
3262089 3263724 If you record any messages,
3263757 3265860 I can get them<br />to transmit it to Cooper.
3267194 3269697 Murph is a bright spark.
3270798 3273700 Maybe I should fan the flame.
3273734 3276570 She's already making fools<br />of her teachers.
3276604 3278973 So maybe she should come<br />and make a fool out of you.
3280107 3281509 So where are they?
3281542 3282844 Heading for Mars.
3283811 3285746 The next time<br />you hear from Cooper,
3285779 3287715 they'll be coming up on Saturn.
3327788 3329123 YOUNG TOM: school goes,
3329156 3331491 the administration wants me<br />to repeat plant pathology.
3331525 3332660 Which sucks.
3333394 3334795 But they said I could start
3334829 3336197 advanced agriculture<br />a year early.
3338666 3342036 All right, I got to go, Dad.<br />Hope you're safe up there.
3346340 3347542 DONALD: I'm sorry, Coop.
3348175 3350110 I asked Murph to say hi,
3350144 3353313 but she's as stubborn<br />as her old man.
3353346 3354916 I'll try again next time.
3370197 3371332 COOPER: You all right, Rom?
3374168 3375936 This gets to me, Cooper.
3375970 3378238 This. This.
3378272 3381374 Millimeters of aluminum,<br />that's it, and then nothing
3381408 3383276 out there for millions of miles
3383310 3385046 won't kill us in seconds.
3386280 3388316 You know that some of the finest
3388349 3392385 solo yachtsmen in the world<br />don't know how to swim?
3392419 3393754 They don't know how.
3393788 3395308 And if they go overboard,<br />they're done.
3397491 3399160 We're explorers, Rom.
3401095 3402597 This is our boat.
3402930 3403931 Here.
3409336 3410838 - (DEVICE BEEPS)<br />- (CRICKETS CHIRPING)
3411338 3412840 (RAIN FALLING)
3415309 3417111 (THUNDER RUMBLING)
3431125 3433093 COOPER: This is<br />from the relay probe?
3433127 3434929 It was in orbit<br />around the wormhole.
3435496 3436664 This is the wormhole,
3436697 3438199 and every time we'd come around,
3438765 3440500 we would receive images
3440534 3442570 from the other side<br />of the foreign galaxy.
3442603 3444505 Oh, yeah. Like swinging<br />a periscope around.
3444538 3445906 Exactly.
3445940 3447773 So we got a pretty good idea
3447808 3450144 what we're gonna find<br />on the other side, huh?
3451445 3452713 Navigationally.
3454581 3455859 BRAND ON INTERCOM:<br />Guys? Looks like we'll be
3455883 3457885 approaching the wormhole<br />in about three hours.
3464357 3465357 Hey, Coop?
3466393 3468228 Can we stop the spinning?
3468262 3469662 - Why?<br />- Um...
3469696 3471732 Because we're close enough<br />to see it now?
3473266 3474267 All right.
3475069 3476069 (WHISPERS) Thanks.
3481909 3484278 There, that's it!<br />That's the wormhole!
3484311 3485446 Say it, don't spray it, Rom.
3486146 3487848 It's a sphere.
3487882 3491284 Of course it is. You thought<br />it would just be a hole?
3492753 3494821 No, it's just that<br />all the illustrations
3494854 3496390 I've ever seen, they...
3496423 3497791 ROMILLY: The illustrations
3497825 3500193 are trying to show you<br />how it works.
3500226 3504396 So they say you want to<br />go from here to there.
3504431 3505566 But it's too far, right?
3505599 3507100 Mmm-hmm.
3507134 3509570 So a wormhole<br />bends space like this,
3509603 3511738 so you can take<br />a shortcut through
3512239 3513674 a higher dimension.
3513707 3515742 Okay, so,
3515776 3517144 to show that, they've turned
3517177 3519979 three-dimensional space<br />into two dimensions,
3520013 3523851 which turns a wormhole into<br />two dimensions... A circle.
3523884 3525920 What's a circle<br />in three dimensions?
3527487 3528789 - A sphere.<br />- Exactly.
3529323 3531592 A spherical hole.
3531625 3534028 But who put it there?<br />Who do we have to thank?
3534661 3536695 I'm not thanking anybody
3536730 3539100 until we get out of here<br />in one piece, Rom.
3546373 3547807 Any trick to this, Doyle?
3549409 3550811 No one knows.
3556416 3557416 (SIGHING)
3558018 3559453 The others made it, right?
3561722 3563124 At least some of them.
3577571 3578873 COOPER: Oh...
3595523 3598325 Everybody ready to say<br />good-bye to our solar system?
3599392 3601228 To our galaxy.
3603397 3604397 Here we go.
3616076 3617945 (RATTLING)
3624717 3626086 (BEEPING)
3636996 3638764 Your controls won't work here.
3638798 3640834 We're passing through the bulk.
3640868 3643036 It's space beyond<br />our three dimensions.
3643070 3644972 All you can do<br />is record and observe.
3653847 3655182 (BREATH TREMBLING)
3656349 3657349 What is that?
3659820 3661821 I think it's them.
3661855 3663457 Distorting spacetime.
3665826 3666826 Don't! Don't!

3693320 3694755 (ALARM STOPS)
3694788 3696023 What was that?
3699059 3700427 The first handshake.
3702196 3703196 We're...
3704831 3706066 We're here.
3727053 3728821 So the lost communications<br />came through.
3728855 3730257 BRAND: How?
3730290 3732225 The relay on this side<br />cached them.
3732259 3736663 So years of basic data.<br />No real surprises.
3736696 3740266 Miller's site has kept<br />pinging thumbs up,<br />as has Dr. Mann's.
3740300 3742336 Edmunds' went down<br />three years ago.
3742902 3744337 Transmitter failure?
3744371 3746039 Maybe. He was sending<br />the thumbs up
3746072 3747440 right until it went dark.
3747474 3749709 But Miller's still looks good,<br />though, right?
3749743 3750786 Because she's coming up fast.
3750810 3752011 Mmm-hmm.
3752045 3754715 With one complication.
3754748 3757650 The planet is much closer to<br />Gargantua than we thought.
3757684 3759019 COOPER: Gargantua?
3759052 3760563 It's what we're calling<br />the black hole.
3760587 3762956 Miller's and Dr. Mann's<br />planets both orbit it.
3762989 3764925 And Miller's is on the horizon?
3764958 3766435 ROMILLY: As a basketball<br />around a hoop.
3766459 3768662 Landing there takes us<br />dangerously close.
3768695 3771498 And a black hole that big<br />has a huge gravitational pull.
3774501 3775935 Look, I could swing around
3775969 3777537 that neutron star to decelerate.
3777571 3779573 No, no, no, it's not that.<br />It's time.
3779606 3781642 The gravity on that planet<br />will slow our clock
3781675 3783744 compared to Earth's drastically.
3784711 3786212 How bad?
3786246 3789416 Every hour we spend<br />on that planet will be
3790583 3792452 seven years back on Earth.
3793620 3795022 (WHISPERS) Jesus!
3795055 3796390 Well, that's relativity, folks.
3798191 3800694 Well, we can't just<br />drop down there without...
3800727 3802762 Cooper, we have a mission.
3802795 3803973 Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,
3803997 3805565 and our mission Plan A is
3805598 3807400 to find a planet that<br />can habitate the people
3807433 3809035 that are living<br />on the Earth right now.
3809068 3810446 You can't just think<br />about your family.
3810470 3811881 Now, you have to think<br />bigger than that, all right?
3811905 3813307 I am thinking about my family
3813340 3815175 and millions of<br />other families, okay?
3815209 3817343 Plan A does not work<br />if the people on Earth
3817377 3819046 are dead by the time<br />we pull it off.
3820580 3822782 No. It doesn't.
3822816 3824051 That's why there's a Plan B.
3826086 3828054 Okay. Cooper's right.
3828088 3829632 We need to think about time<br />as a resource,
3829656 3830891 just like oxygen and food.
3830924 3832244 Going down there<br />is gonna cost us.
3834027 3835195 All right, look.
3836830 3838698 Dr. Mann's data<br />is promising, right,
3838732 3840476 but it's going to take us<br />months to get there.
3840500 3842703 And Edmunds', it's even further.
3842736 3843904 Now Miller hasn't sent much,
3843937 3845247 but what she has sent<br />is very promising.
3845271 3846906 It's water, it's organics...
3846939 3847984 You don't find that every day.
3848008 3849576 No, you don't.
3849610 3852079 And just think<br />about the resources,<br />including time,
3852112 3854181 that would be spent<br />trying to get back here.
3855449 3857083 - Romilly?<br />- Yeah.
3857117 3859285 How far off from Miller's<br />planet do we have to be
3859318 3861555 to stay out of the time shift?
3861588 3862823 Just back from the cusp.
3863490 3864858 Which is here,
3864892 3866102 just outside of Miller's planet.
3866126 3867694 - ROMILLY: Right.<br />- Okay.
3869129 3872232 Here's Gargantua.<br />Here's Miller's planet.
3872265 3873933 Instead of taking the Endurance
3873967 3875210 into orbit<br />around Miller's planet,
3875234 3876736 which would conserve fuel,
3876770 3878471 but we would lose a lot of time,
3878505 3881407 what if we take a wider orbit<br />around Gargantua,
3881441 3882909 parallel with Miller's planet,
3882943 3885278 outside of this time shift,<br />to here?
3885311 3886780 Then we take the Ranger down,
3886813 3888382 we get Miller,<br />we get her samples.
3888415 3889950 We come back,<br />we analyze, we debrief.
3889983 3891351 We're in, we're out.
3891385 3893753 We lose a little fuel,<br />but we save a lot of time.
3893787 3895555 - That'll work.<br />- That's good.
3895589 3896966 There's not gonna be time<br />for monkey business
3896990 3898358 or chit-chat down there.
3898392 3901328 So, TARS, you should<br />definitely stay here.
3901361 3903964 CASE, you're with me.<br />Anyone else can stay.
3903997 3905932 If we're talking<br />about a couple years,
3905965 3907510 I could use the time<br />to research gravity.
3907534 3909169 Observations from the wormhole,
3909202 3910804 that's gold to Professor Brand.
3910838 3912539 TARS, factor an orbit<br />of Gargantua.
3912572 3914775 Conserve fuel,<br />minimize thrusting,
3914808 3917043 but make sure we stay<br />in range of Miller's planet.
3917077 3918378 You got it?
3918411 3919912 TARS: I wouldn't<br />leave you behind,
3919946 3920946 Dr. Brand.
3925952 3927287 - COOPER: You ready, CASE?<br />- Yup.
3928354 3930056 You don't say much, do you?
3930089 3931891 TARS talks plenty<br />for both of us.
3931924 3932893 (BEEPING)
3932926 3933926 Detach.
3941701 3943245 - (RATTLING)<br />- Romilly, are you reading these forces?
3943269 3944349 ROMILLY: It's unbelievable.
3947808 3949576 A literal heart of darkness.
3954180 3956984 If we could just see<br />the collapsed star inside
3957017 3960120 the singularity,<br />yeah, we'd solve gravity.
3960153 3961621 And we can't<br />get anything from it?
3961654 3963156 ROMILLY: Nothing<br />escapes that horizon.
3963190 3965124 Not even light.
3965158 3967060 Oh, the answer's there,<br />just no way to see it.
3967093 3968328 There's Miller's planet.
3971197 3972465 Good-bye, Ranger.
3985545 3987512 CASE: This is fast<br />for atmospheric entry.
3987547 3988891 Should we use<br />the thrusters to slow?
3988915 3990750 No.
3990784 3992619 No, I'm gonna use<br />the Ranger's aerodynamics
3992652 3993987 to save some fuel.
3994021 3995354 CASE: Air brake?
3995388 3996665 We want to get down fast,<br />don't we?
3996689 3998592 Actually, we want to<br />get there in one piece.
3998958 4000226 Hang on.
4000260 4001828 CASE: Brand, Doyle, get ready.
4008668 4009970 (PANTING)
4011137 4012573 (BEEPING)
4018078 4019379 CASE: We should ease!
4019412 4020489 COOPER: Hands where I can<br />see 'em, CASE.
4020513 4021814 The only time I ever went down
4021848 4024317 was when a machine was<br />easing at the wrong time.
4024350 4025862 - CASE: A little caution...<br />- Can get you killed,
4025886 4027186 Just like reckless driving.
4027220 4028264 DOYLE: Cooper,<br />it's too damn fast!
4028288 4029456 I got this.
4034494 4035872 CASE: Should I disable<br />the feedback?
4035896 4037831 No. No,<br />I need to feel the air.
4042269 4043470 Here we go.
4046372 4047608 DOYLE: It's just water!
4048007 4049175 (PANTING)
4049209 4050611 The stuff of life.
4051244 4052979 CASE: 1,200 meters.
4053012 4054280 Do we have a fix on the beacon?
4054314 4056049 CASE: Got it!<br />Can you maneuver?
4056082 4058051 I'm gonna need to<br />shave some speed.
4058084 4059362 I'm gonna spiral down<br />on top of it.
4059386 4060386 Everybody hang on!
4062822 4063822 CASE: 700.
4066126 4067861 On my cue, CASE. On my cue.

4142769 4144404 About 200 meters.
4154146 4155581 The gravity's punishing.
4156782 4159017 Been floating through space<br />too long?

4161220 4162923 Come on.
4162956 4164796 - (BRAND GRUNTING ON RADIO)<br />- Come on, come on.
4166059 4167393 There's nothing here.
4167427 4168594 CASE: Should be right here.
4170664 4173500 If the signal's coming<br />from here...
4183143 4184143 Her beacon.
4192519 4193620 DOYLE: Wreckage.
4194387 4195455 Where's the rest?
4196188 4197490 BRAND: Towards the mountains!
4201294 4202929 Those aren't mountains.
4204964 4206265 They're waves.
4206299 4207768 What? What?
4211604 4214874 Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
4214908 4216575 COOPER: That one's<br />moving away from us.
4223383 4224785 BRAND: We need the recorder.
4235295 4237697 Brand, Doyle,<br />back to the Ranger now!
4237730 4241034 BRAND: We're not leaving<br />without her data.
4241067 4242402 COOPER: Get back here now!
4242435 4244303 We do not have time!
4244337 4245538 A second wave is coming!
4245571 4246811 We're in the middle of a swell.
4248207 4249775 BRAND: No, I got it.
4249809 4251645 Get your ass<br />back to the Ranger, now!
4252145 4253647 (BRAND GRUNTING)
4256716 4258084 Brand, get back here, now!
4258918 4260987 (GASPS)
4261021 4263021 BRAND: No, Cooper, go.<br />Cooper, go. I can't make it.
4263156 4264291 Go!
4264324 4265324 CASE, go get her.
4270630 4271597 Go!
4271631 4272631 Get up! Get up, Brand!
4273499 4274868 DOYLE: Go, go! Go!
4276336 4277536 I'm not gonna make it!
4277570 4279105 Yes, you are. Yes, you are!
4283008 4284211 (GRUNTING)
4286646 4288515 Come on, CASE has her!<br />Get back here, Doyle!
4290282 4291417 (BRAND CONTINUES GRUNTING)
4291451 4292486 Come on, Brand!
4295288 4296288 Get to the hatch!
4298124 4299493 (PANTING)
4301127 4302596 Go, go! Go!
4304964 4305964 (BEEPING)
4308367 4310203 COOPER: Shit.
4310236 4311705 Manually overriding<br />inside hatch!
4315341 4316341 Cooper! Wait!
4317510 4319646 Cooper, wait! Wait! Stop it!
4323950 4325251 COOPER: The engines<br />are flooded!
4325284 4327287 I'm gonna have to shut her down.
4332091 4333226 (BRAND SCREAMING)
4334193 4335193 (GRUNTS)
4352912 4354648 (BRAND GASPS)
4358250 4359250 (GASPING)
4360953 4361953 Holy shit.
4366893 4368133 - Hang on!<br />- (CONTINUES GASPING)
4372532 4373867 (SCREAMING)
4376068 4377137 (GRUNTS)
4380506 4381807 (BOTH PANTING)
4399359 4400825 CASE, what's the problem?
4400860 4402929 CASE: Too waterlogged.<br />Let it drain.
4404097 4405664 God damn it!
4405698 4406866 I told you to leave me!
4406867 4408034 And I told you...
4408068 4409252 Why didn't you leave me?
4409253 4410436 To get your ass back here!
4410470 4411705 The difference is one of us
4411738 4412815 was thinking<br />about the mission, Brand!
4412839 4414941 You were thinking about<br />getting home.
4416976 4419445 I was trying to do<br />the right thing!
4419479 4421114 Can you tell that to Doyle?
4421447 4423382 (GASPING)
4423416 4424526 COOPER: CASE, how much time?
4424550 4425685 45 to an hour.
4426052 4427686 (GASPS)
4427720 4428920 COOPER:<br />The stuff of life, huh?
4429923 4431203 What's this gonna<br />cost us, Brand?
4432158 4433994 A lot. Decades.
4438531 4439833 (GROANS)
4441501 4442669 What happened to Miller?
4443636 4445838 Judging by the wreckage,
4445871 4448375 she was broken up by a wave<br />soon after impact.
4449476 4450753 How's the wreckage<br />stayed together
4450777 4451878 after all these years, huh?
4453412 4455115 Because of the time slippage.
4456650 4460754 On this planet's time,<br />she just landed hours ago.
4461921 4464490 She probably just died<br />minutes ago.
4464524 4466769 CASE: The data Doyle received<br />was just the initial status,
4466793 4468794 echoing endlessly.
4468828 4470129 Oh, we are not<br />prepared for this.
4473533 4477035 You eggheads have the survival<br />skills of a Boy Scout troop.
4477070 4478771 Well, we got this far<br />on our brains,
4478804 4480506 farther than any human<br />in history.
4480540 4482408 Well, not far enough!
4482442 4483909 And now we're stuck here
4483943 4485863 till there won't be anyone<br />left on Earth to save.
4489048 4491184 I'm counting every minute,<br />same as you, Cooper.
4496422 4497891 Is there any possibility...
4498357 4499859 I don't know...
4499892 4502161 Some kind of way we can maybe<br />all jump in a black hole?
4502194 4503263 Gain back the years?
4503296 4504564 (SCOFFS)
4504597 4506399 Don't shake your head at me.
4506432 4508435 Time is relative, okay?
4508468 4511071 It can stretch<br />and it can squeeze, but
4511971 4514406 it can't run backwards.<br />It just can't.
4514440 4517476 The only thing that can move<br />across dimensions, like time,
4517510 4518510 is gravity.
4521147 4522182 Okay.
4524750 4528721 The beings that led us here,<br />they communicate
4528754 4529822 through gravity, right?
4529823 4530890 (WHISPERS) Yes.
4530923 4532643 Could they be talking to us<br />from the future?
4533493 4534759 Maybe.
4534793 4535795 Okay. If they can...
4537196 4540900 "They" are beings<br />of five dimensions.
4540933 4543903 To them, time might be<br />another physical dimension.
4544203 4545937 To them,
4545971 4547906 the past might be a canyon
4547940 4550576 that they can climb into<br />and the future,
4550610 4553246 a mountain they can climb up.<br />But to us, it's not, okay?
4554780 4556916 Look, Cooper, I screwed up.<br />I'm sorry.
4559352 4561053 But you knew about relativity.
4561087 4562087 Oh...
4564090 4565125 Brand...
4565825 4567193 (INHALES DEEPLY)
4570396 4572965 My daughter was 10 years old.
4572998 4574209 I couldn't teach her<br />Einstein's theories
4574233 4576235 before I left.
4576269 4578629 Couldn't you have told her you<br />were going to save the world?
4579238 4580238 No.
4581974 4584410 When you become a parent,
4584444 4585684 one thing becomes really clear.
4587914 4589024 And that is that<br />you want to make sure
4589048 4590283 your children feel safe.
4592118 4594020 And it rules out<br />telling a 10-year-old
4594053 4595488 that the world is ending.
4597723 4598723 CASE: Cooper?
4599458 4601161 (RUMBLING FROM OUTSIDE)
4603462 4604507 How long for the engines, CASE?
4604531 4605698 A minute or two.
4605731 4606842 COOPER: Well,<br />we don't have it.
4606866 4608001 Helmets on!
4611937 4614073 Brand, co-pilot, you're up.
4614106 4616675 CASE, blow the cabin oxygen<br />through the main thrusters!
4616709 4618611 - We're gonna spark it.<br />- Roger that.
4618644 4619846 - Locked.<br />- Depressurizing.
4626051 4627491 - Engines up!<br />- (ENGINES POWERING UP)
4655882 4657350 Hello, Rom.
4657950 4659452 I've waited years.
4660786 4662355 How many...<br />How many years?
4664523 4665858 ROMILLY: By now it must be...
4665891 4669094 TARS: 23 years,<br />four months, eight days.
4673466 4674466 Doyle?
4681273 4683977 I thought I was prepared.<br />I knew the theory.
4685645 4686845 (WHISPERS)<br />Reality's different.
4687813 4688915 ROMILLY: And Miller?
4690850 4691970 There's nothing here for us.
4695688 4696923 (SOFTLY)<br />Why didn't you sleep?
4697957 4700493 Oh, I had a couple of stretches.
4700526 4702662 But I stopped believing<br />you were coming back.
4702695 4706131 And something seemed wrong<br />about dreaming my life away.
4706165 4709835 I learned what I could<br />from the black hole,
4709869 4712271 but I couldn't send anything<br />to your father.
4712304 4714573 We've been receiving,<br />but nothing gets out.
4714606 4715641 BRAND: Is he alive?
4715674 4716642 Oh, yeah.
4716676 4717776 Yeah?
4717810 4718977 Yeah.
4722147 4724851 ROMILLY: We've got years<br />of messages stored.
4724884 4726619 Cooper.
4726652 4729389 MALE AUTOMATED VOICE:<br />Messages span 23 years.
4731724 4733159 Play it from the beginning.
4736429 4738031 YOUNG TOM: Hey, Dad.
4738898 4741167 Checking in. Saying hi.
4742234 4743234 Um...
4744136 4745571 Finished second in school.
4747607 4750242 Miss Kurling's<br />still giving me C's though.
4750276 4752712 Pulled me down,<br />but second's not bad.
4754013 4756049 Grandpa attended the ceremony.
4757583 4758817 Um...
4758851 4759986 Oh.
4760920 4762754 I met another girl, Dad.
4762788 4764057 I, uh...
4765324 4767192 I really think this is the one.
4768661 4771330 Name's Lois.<br />That's her right there.
4771364 4772598 (COOPER SOBBING)
4774166 4776035 Murphy stole Grandpa's car.
4777169 4779439 She crashed it.<br />She's okay, though.
4779972 4781074 Hey, Dad.
4782375 4783443 Look at this!
4784543 4785712 You're a grandpa.
4787246 4788748 His name's Jesse.
4789748 4791250 I wanted to call him Coop,
4791284 4795254 but Lois says, uh,<br />maybe next time.
4795287 4797065 Donald says he's already<br />earned the "great" part,
4797089 4799225 so we just leave it at that.
4801093 4802428 Just hold him.
4802462 4803696 (JESSE GURGLING)
4803729 4805097 LOIS: Oh, dear.
4805131 4807298 Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."
4807333 4809402 - Bye-bye, Grandpa. It's okay.<br />- (JESSE FUSSING)
4809435 4811637 Sorry it's been a while.<br />It's, uh...
4813406 4814406 (SOFTLY) Just...
4816642 4818378 What with Jesse and all.
4821546 4822548 Uh...
4825084 4828121 Grandpa died last week.
4828154 4830656 We buried him out in the<br />back forty next to Mom and...
4831623 4832623 Jesse.
4834126 4836596 Which is where we would have<br />buried you if you'd ever
4837529 4838798 come back.
4840532 4843669 Murph was there at the funeral.
4843703 4846138 We don't see her that much,<br />but she came for that.
4849541 4851611 You aren't listening to this,<br />I know that.
4855081 4857550 All these messages<br />are just, like,
4859051 4862422 drifting out there<br />in the darkness.
4863722 4865725 Lois says that, uh,
4866825 4869362 I have to let you go.
4869828 4871531 And, uh...
4871963 4873066 So...
4876735 4879472 I guess I'm letting you go.
4880907 4883909 I don't know where you are, Dad,
4883942 4886379 but I hope<br />that you're at peace and...
4888180 4889281 Good-bye.
4902928 4904163 Hey, Dad.
4907066 4908334 (WHISPERS) Hey, Murph.
4908367 4910236 You son of a bitch.
4914373 4917042 I never made one of these<br />when you were still responding
4917075 4918811 because I was so mad at you<br />for leaving.
4922181 4924116 And then when you went quiet,
4927186 4928564 it seemed like I should<br />live with that decision.
4928588 4929588 And I have.
4934159 4936429 But today's my birthday.
4940432 4943436 And it's a special one,<br />because you told me...
4943469 4944537 (SIGHS)
4947673 4949975 You once told me that<br />when you came back,
4950008 4951677 we might be the same age.
4953712 4956714 And today I'm the age<br />you were when you left.
4956748 4957850 (SOBBING)
4959852 4962522 So it would be a real good<br />time for you to come back.
4966359 4968160 (SWITCHES CAMERA OFF)
4970095 4971397 (SNIFFLES)
4976268 4978404 I didn't mean to intrude.
4978437 4981240 It's just that I've never<br />seen you in here before.
4981273 4983242 I've never been in here before.
4985410 4987947 PROFESSOR BRAND:<br />I talk to Amelia all the time.
4988713 4989815 It helps.
4990783 4992017 I'm glad you've started.
4992050 4993953 MURPH: I haven't.
4993986 4996388 I just had something<br />I needed to get out.
4996422 4997799 PROFESSOR BRAND: I know<br />they're still out there.
4997823 4999324 MURPH: I know.
4999357 5001927 There are so many reasons<br />their communications
5001960 5003120 might not be getting through.
5003662 5004662 I know, Professor.
5005564 5008234 I'm not sure<br />what I'm more afraid of.
5009702 5011704 Them never coming back,
5013238 5016240 or coming back<br />to find we've failed.
5016275 5017476 Then let's succeed.
5018778 5019778 So...
5020512 5022648 Back to the fourth iteration.
5022681 5024950 Let's run it through<br />some new fields.
5024983 5026352 With respect, Professor,
5026385 5028420 we've tried that<br />hundreds of times.
5028454 5031824 It only has to work once, Murph.
5035594 5039532 Every rivet that<br />they strike could<br />have been a bullet.
5039565 5041633 We've done well<br />for the world here,
5041667 5044002 whether or not<br />we crack the equation
5044035 5046539 before I kick the bucket.
5046572 5048073 Don't be morbid, Professor.
5048106 5049275 I'm not afraid of death.
5050142 5051744 I'm an old physicist.
5053145 5054680 I'm afraid of time.
5062021 5063021 MURPH: Time.
5065224 5066726 You're afraid of time.
5069662 5071663 For years, we've been<br />trying to solve the equation
5071697 5072874 without changing<br />the underlying assumption
5072898 5074400 about time.
5074433 5076401 - And?<br />- And that means
5076435 5081140 Each iteration is an attempt<br />to prove its own proof.
5081173 5083275 It's recursive.<br />It's nonsensical.
5083309 5085277 Are you calling my life's work
5085311 5087346 nonsense, Murph?
5087379 5089214 No, I'm saying<br />you've been trying to
5089247 5090481 finish it with one arm...
5090515 5092884 No, with both arms<br />tied behind your back.
5095320 5097056 And I don't understand why.
5098257 5099892 I'm an old man, Murph.
5101227 5103962 Can we take this point up<br />at another time?
5103995 5105765 I want to talk to my daughter.
5108434 5111003 PROFESSOR BRAND: Stepping out<br />into the universe,
5111037 5114407 we must confront the reality<br />of interstellar travel.
5115607 5120546 We must reach far beyond<br />our own lifespans.
5120579 5125051 We must think not as<br />individuals but as a species.
5128254 5131424 "Do not go gentle<br />into that good night."
5133225 5134493 COOPER: TARS<br />kept the Endurance
5134526 5135894 right where we needed her.
5135927 5138997 But the trip took years longer<br />than we anticipated.
5139030 5142067 We no longer have the fuel<br />to visit both prospects, so...
5142735 5143936 We have to choose.
5145237 5146372 But how?
5147505 5148974 They're both promising.
5150642 5152545 Edmunds' data is better,
5152578 5155481 but Dr. Mann is the one<br />still transmitting.
5155514 5156648 We've no reason to suspect
5156681 5158084 Edmunds' data would have soured.
5159585 5162020 His world has key elements<br />to sustain human life.
5162054 5163455 As does Dr. Mann's.
5163488 5164990 Cooper, this is my field.
5166225 5167225 And...
5168527 5170496 I really believe Edmunds'<br />is the better prospect.
5170529 5171864 Why?
5171897 5173132 Gargantua, that's why.
5175200 5179204 Look at Miller's planet.<br />Hydrocarbons, organics, yes.
5179238 5182406 But no life. Sterile.
5182440 5183840 We'll find the same thing<br />on Mann's.
5184109 5186044 Because of the black hole?
5186078 5187212 BRAND: Murphy's Law.
5187246 5189515 Whatever can happen will happen.
5189548 5191816 Accident is the first<br />building block of evolution.
5191850 5193161 But when you're orbiting<br />a black hole,
5193185 5194753 not enough can happen.
5194786 5197389 It sucks in asteroids<br />and comets,
5197422 5199458 other events which would<br />otherwise reach you.
5199491 5201026 We need to go further afield.
5201994 5203963 You once said that Dr. Mann
5205430 5207199 was the best of us.
5207232 5209068 He's remarkable.
5209101 5210341 We're only here because of him.
5211036 5213004 And yet here he is.
5213038 5214640 He's on the ground,
5214673 5217209 and he's sending a very<br />unambiguous message,
5217242 5220045 telling us to<br />come to his planet.
5220079 5224483 Granted, but Edmunds' data<br />is more promising.
5225084 5226184 We should vote.
5226217 5227419 Well, if we're going to vote,
5227453 5228773 there's something<br />you should know.
5229388 5230923 Brand?
5230956 5232091 He has a right to know.
5233158 5234493 That has nothing to do with it.
5234859 5236195 What does?
5236228 5238063 She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.
5238097 5239164 ROMILLY: Is that true?
5239197 5240466 Yes.
5243902 5246205 And that makes me<br />want to follow my heart.
5249708 5251676 But maybe we've spent too long
5251710 5253545 trying to figure all this out<br />with theory.
5253579 5255213 You're a scientist, Brand.
5255247 5256582 So listen to me
5257750 5261219 when I say that love isn't<br />something we invented.
5261253 5263255 It's (SIGHS)
5263289 5265491 observable, powerful.
5267659 5269628 It has to mean something.
5269661 5272163 Love has meaning, yes.<br />Social utility,
5272197 5274033 social bonding, child rearing...
5274066 5276168 We love people who have died.
5276202 5277562 Where's the social utility<br />in that?
5278270 5279704 None.
5279738 5283307 Maybe it means something more,<br />something we can't
5283342 5285744 yet understand.
5285778 5288848 Maybe it's some evidence,<br />some...
5290315 5292551 artifact of a higher dimension
5292584 5294786 that we can't<br />consciously perceive.
5294819 5297289 I'm drawn across the universe
5297322 5299624 to someone I haven't seen<br />in a decade,
5299658 5302928 who I know is probably dead.
5302962 5306498 Love is the one thing<br />we're capable of perceiving
5306531 5308934 that transcends dimensions<br />of time and space.
5311236 5312671 Maybe we should trust that,
5312704 5314607 even if we can't<br />understand it yet.
5320378 5321747 All right, Cooper...
5323915 5324950 Yes,
5326818 5329522 the tiniest possibility of<br />seeing Wolf again excites me.
5330589 5331957 That doesn't mean I'm wrong.
5332991 5334760 Honestly, Amelia,
5336895 5337895 it might.
5341900 5342900 (SOBS)
5344970 5347540 TARS, chart a course<br />for Dr. Mann's.
5364790 5367626 We'll lose about a third<br />again. But next year...
5367660 5368761 (CLICKS TONGUE)
5369928 5371529 Next year I'm gonna work<br />Nelson's farm
5371563 5372631 and I'll make it up.
5373665 5375134 What happened to Nelson?
5381506 5382717 LOIS: Murph,<br />have you eaten enough?
5382741 5383918 Would you like<br />some more souffle?
5383942 5386845 No, no. I'm full, thanks.<br />It was delicious.
5387979 5389815 Coop, finish your fritter,<br />please.
5392250 5393952 Will you spend the night?
5393985 5396254 Your room is exactly<br />as you left it. It's ready.
5396287 5397722 I need to get back.<br />(SNIFFLES)
5397756 5398833 LOIS: My sewing machine<br />is in there,
5398857 5400191 but there's plenty of...
5400225 5401259 I need to...
5404363 5405363 Too many memories.
5405397 5406698 TOM: Well...
5406731 5408300 We might have<br />something for that.
5408333 5409333 Hey, Coop.
5414406 5416175 (COOP COUGHING)
5417108 5418108 The dust.
5420946 5422380 Lois, I have a friend who...
5422414 5423848 (COOP COUGHING)
5423882 5424962 could look at his lungs.
5443569 5444803 COOPER: Amelia, I'm sorry.
5444836 5446305 You were just being objective.
5446338 5447773 Unless you're punishing me
5447806 5449975 for screwing up<br />on Miller's planet.
5450008 5452011 No, this wasn't<br />a personal decision.
5452811 5454145 If you're wrong,
5454179 5457148 you will have a very personal<br />decision to make.
5457182 5460552 Your fuel calculations are<br />based on a return journey.
5460585 5462721 Strike out on Mann's planet,
5462754 5464756 and we'll have to decide<br />whether to return home
5464790 5467259 or push on to Edmunds'<br />with Plan B.
5467292 5471296 Starting a colony<br />could save us<br />from extinction.
5471330 5472731 You might have to decide between
5472764 5474565 seeing your children again
5474599 5476101 and the future<br />of the human race.
5477836 5479236 I trust you'll be<br />as objective then.
5486277 5488513 He's been asking for you<br />since he came to.
5488546 5489847 We were trying to reach you.
5492784 5493784 MURPH: (WHISPERS)<br />Hey.
5495921 5496921 Murph.
5497922 5499223 Hi. I'm here, Professor.
5500325 5502894 (WEAKLY) I let them all down.
5502927 5506031 No, you got us so far!<br />Real close.
5508066 5510102 I'll finish what you started.
5510135 5512037 Good, good, Murph.
5514539 5516475 You had faith
5518110 5519110 all those...
5520379 5521947 All those years.
5523615 5524717 I...
5525350 5527352 I asked you to have faith.
5529521 5531990 I wanted you to believe
5533725 5535360 that your father...
5538663 5540132 would come back.
5540532 5541734 I do, Professor.
5543435 5544837 Forgive me, Murph.
5545737 5547473 There's nothing to forgive.
5550341 5551341 I...
5552077 5553746 I lied, Murph.
5556281 5557883 I lied to you.
5564422 5567392 There was no need for him
5568827 5570395 to come back.
5573565 5576401 There is no...<br />No way to help us.
5577735 5578837 But Plan A...
5579538 5582406 All this. All these people.
5583642 5585277 And the equation.
5589614 5591116 Did my father know?
5595220 5596555 Did he leave me?
5600625 5601625 Do
5603127 5604163 Not
5605130 5606131 go
5607732 5609168 Gentle...
5611402 5612402 No.
5614172 5615172 No!
5616408 5617976 You can't leave.
5618409 5619444 You... No.
5621079 5622681 MURPH: Dr. Brand,<br />I'm sorry to tell
5622714 5625384 that your father died today.<br />He had no pain.
5625918 5627451 He was at peace.
5628654 5630522 I'm very sorry for your loss.<br />(SNIFFLES)
5643001 5644469 Brand, did you know?
5647105 5648574 He told you, right?
5649274 5650342 (BITTER LAUGH)
5651776 5652945 You knew.
5655080 5656548 This was all a sham.
5661386 5663422 You left us here.
5664923 5666325 To suffocate.
5668626 5669928 To starve.
5694352 5695587 (BEEPING)

5843000 5844636 It's okay.
5844669 5846138 It's okay.
5852810 5854245 It's okay.
5859917 5861553 Pray you never learn
5863288 5866158 just how good it can be<br />to see another face.
5875200 5877635 I hadn't a lot of hope<br />to begin with, but...
5877668 5879538 After so long, I had none.
5881539 5884142 My supplies were<br />completely exhausted.
5886411 5887879 The last time I went to sleep,
5887912 5889714 I didn't even set a waking date.
5894119 5896321 You have literally<br />raised me from the dead.
5897455 5898857 - Lazarus.<br />- Hmm.
5900725 5902259 What about the others?
5902293 5903695 I'm afraid you're it, sir.
5904629 5906798 So far, surely.
5907932 5910935 No, our present situation<br />is that there's very little
5910968 5912404 chance of rescuing any others.
5916340 5918276 BRAND: Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?
5919644 5920879 Tell us about your world.
5922380 5923380 (SNIFFLES)
5924582 5926218 Our world, we hope.
5930288 5932357 Our world, uh, is cold,
5932824 5933859 stark,
5935926 5937495 but undeniably beautiful.
5940298 5943235 The days are 67 hours long,<br />cold.
5947539 5949074 The nights are
5949107 5951309 67 far colder hours.
5957616 5962119 The gravity is a very, very<br />pleasant 80% of the Earth's.
5962153 5965389 Now, up here where I landed,<br />the water is alkali,
5965423 5967392 and the air has too much<br />ammonia in it to breathe
5967425 5968993 for more than<br />just a few minutes,
5969026 5970862 but down at the surface...
5970895 5972897 And there is a surface.
5973798 5975800 The chlorine dissipates.
5975833 5978036 The ammonia gives way<br />to crystalline hydrocarbons
5978069 5979337 and breathable air.
5979771 5981706 To organics.
5981739 5983607 Possibly, even to life.
5985009 5987378 We might be sharing this world.
5987412 5989580 These readings<br />are from the surface?
5989613 5993017 Over the years,<br />I've dropped various probes.
5993050 5994361 COOPER: How far<br />have you explored?
5994385 5996521 I've mounted<br />several major expeditions.
5996554 5998222 But with oxygen<br />in limited supply,
5998256 6000624 KIPP there really did<br />most of the legwork.
6000659 6002227 TARS: What went wrong<br />with him, sir?
6002260 6003661 DR. MANN: Degeneration.
6003694 6005696 He misidentified<br />the first organics we found
6005730 6007298 as ammonia crystals.
6007332 6008866 He struggled on for a time,
6008900 6011602 but ultimately<br />I decommissioned him
6011636 6014338 and used his power source<br />to keep the mission going.
6014371 6017008 I thought I was alone<br />before I shut him down!
6017041 6018561 TARS: Would you like me<br />to look at him?
6019310 6022180 No. No.<br />He needs a human touch.
6022213 6024382 TARS: Dr. Brand, CASE is<br />relaying a message for you
6024416 6026350 from the comm station.
6026384 6028220 Okay. Be right there.<br />Excuse me.
6040965 6042205 Dr. Brand,<br />I'm sorry to tell you
6042233 6043353 that your father died today.
6044002 6045402 He had no pain.
6048807 6050008 He was at peace.
6052276 6053812 I'm sorry for your loss.
6056781 6057781 BRAND: Is that Murph?
6058315 6061018 She's... She's grown.
6061052 6062420 MURPH: Brand, did you know?
6063788 6065290 He told you, right?
6065890 6066991 (BITTER LAUGH)
6068259 6069461 You knew.
6071395 6072763 This was all a sham.
6074032 6075533 You left us here.
6077802 6079037 To suffocate.
6081305 6082606 To starve.
6086144 6087612 Did my father know, too?
6090215 6091483 (SOBBING) Dad?
6093518 6095320 I just want to know
6096855 6098589 if you left me here to die.
6101392 6103328 I just have to know.
6104061 6105061 (CONTINUES SOBBING)
6109000 6110368 Cooper, my...
6111969 6114272 My father dedicated
6114305 6116373 his whole life to Plan A.
6116407 6119010 I have no idea<br />what she's talking about.
6120812 6121812 DR. MANN: I do.
6127585 6129754 He never even hoped to<br />get the people off the Earth?
6130955 6131955 No.
6136461 6137571 But he's been trying to solve
6137595 6139431 the gravity equation<br />for 40 years.
6140965 6143835 Amelia, your father<br />solved his equation<br />before I even left.
6145002 6146704 Then why wouldn't he use it?
6146737 6148740 The equation couldn't<br />reconcile relativity
6148773 6150875 with quantum mechanics.<br />You need more.
6150909 6153009 More? More what?
6153043 6154312 DR. MANN: More data.
6154345 6156247 You need to see<br />into a black hole.
6156281 6158349 The laws of nature prohibit<br />a naked singularity.
6158383 6159684 Romilly, is that true?
6161252 6162787 If a black hole is an oyster,
6162820 6165189 then the singularity's<br />the pearl inside.
6165222 6167925 The gravity's so strong,<br />it's always hidden<br />in darkness
6167958 6169127 behind the horizon.
6170895 6173129 That's why we call it<br />a black hole.
6173163 6175232 Okay, but (BREATHING HEAVILY)
6175266 6176506 if we see beyond the horizon...
6177068 6179036 We can't, Coop.
6179070 6180114 DR. MANN:<br />There are some things
6180138 6181539 that aren't meant to be known.
6181572 6183408 Your father had to<br />find another way
6183441 6185777 to save the human race<br />from extinction.
6185810 6187311 Plan B. A colony.
6187344 6188847 Why not tell people?
6190681 6192415 Why keep building<br />those damn stations?
6192450 6193885 Because he knew<br />how hard it would be
6193918 6196219 to get people to work together<br />to save the species
6196254 6197689 instead of themselves.
6198222 6199357 Or their children.
6199390 6200924 Bullshit.
6200958 6202469 You never would've come here<br />unless you believed
6202493 6203994 you were gonna save them.
6204028 6206230 Evolution has yet<br />to transcend<br />that simple barrier.
6206263 6209100 We can care deeply, selflessly
6209133 6210534 about those we know,
6210567 6212103 but that empathy rarely extends
6212136 6213303 beyond our line of sight.
6213337 6214906 But the lie.
6218375 6220478 That monstrous lie?
6221846 6222846 Unforgivable.
6223347 6225716 And he knew that.
6225750 6227752 He was prepared to<br />destroy his own humanity
6227785 6230120 in order to save the species.
6230154 6231298 He made an incredible sacrifice.
6231322 6232424 No.
6233992 6236427 No, an incredible sacrifice<br />is being made
6236460 6238696 by the people on Earth<br />who are gonna die!
6239330 6242132 Because in his arrogance
6242166 6243802 he declared their case hopeless.
6244568 6245937 I'm sorry, Cooper,
6246604 6247972 their case is hopeless.
6248272 6250008 No. No.
6251008 6252110 We are the future.
6256247 6257949 Cooper, what can I do?
6261252 6263687 Let me go home.
6263721 6266490 GETTY: You're<br />absolutely positive?
6266524 6268593 His solution was correct.<br />He'd had it for years.
6269327 6270662 It's worthless?
6270695 6271830 It's half the answer.
6273231 6275834 Okay. How do you find<br />the other half?
6276634 6278469 Out there? A black hole.
6278502 6279870 But stuck down here on Earth?
6279904 6281071 Yeah?
6282606 6284075 I'm not sure you can.
6286443 6288746 GETTY: God,<br />they just pack up and leave.
6290447 6292150 What are they hoping to find?
6292916 6293916 Survival.
6301759 6302759 Damn it.
6305697 6307031 Murph.
6307064 6308499 Don't... (SIGHS)
6308533 6309853 Don't people have<br />a right to know?
6310234 6312337 Well, panic won't help.
6312370 6314539 We just have to keep working,<br />same as ever.
6314572 6316574 Yeah. But isn't that exactly
6316607 6317984 what Professor Brand was<br />manipulating us to do?
6318008 6319376 Brand gave up on us.
6319410 6321012 I'm still trying to solve this.
6321813 6322813 So...
6324348 6325850 Do you have an idea?
6326550 6327886 A feeling.
6331488 6333156 I told you about my ghost.
6335593 6337795 My dad thought<br />I called it a ghost
6337829 6339297 because I was scared of it.
6343200 6344360 But I was never scared of it.
6346804 6349073 I called it a ghost<br />because it felt...
6351676 6353177 It felt like a person.
6356013 6357373 It was trying to<br />tell me something.
6360818 6363321 If there's an answer<br />here on Earth, it's back there
6364155 6365790 somehow, in that room.
6366491 6368059 So I have to find it.
6369293 6370293 (ENGINE STARTING)
6371662 6373197 We're running out of time.
6375666 6377568 CASE: What about auxiliary<br />oxygen scrubbers?
6377602 6378869 COOPER: No,<br />they can stay, CASE.
6378903 6380080 I'll be sleeping<br />most of the way, anyway.
6380104 6381806 - Hey, Coop.<br />- Yeah.
6381839 6384008 I have a suggestion<br />for your return journey.
6384042 6385375 Yeah, what's that?
6385409 6386889 Have one last crack<br />at the black hole.
6388446 6390281 I'm going home, Rom.
6390314 6393183 Yeah, I know.<br />This isn't going to<br />cost you any time.
6394452 6396052 There's a chance<br />for the people on Earth.
6396320 6397721 Talk to me.
6397755 6399923 Gargantua's an older<br />spinning black hole.
6399957 6402293 It's what we call<br />a gentle singularity.
6402593 6403861 Gentle?
6403894 6405530 They're hardly gentle.
6405563 6407665 But the tidal gravity<br />is so quick that
6407698 6410468 something crossing the horizon<br />fast might survive.
6410501 6412270 A probe, say.
6412303 6413704 What happens after it crosses?
6413737 6417174 After the horizon<br />is a complete mystery.
6417208 6420277 So, what's to say there<br />isn't some way that the probe
6420310 6423314 can glimpse the singularity<br />and relay the quantum data?
6423347 6424648 If he's equipped to transmit
6424682 6426851 every form of energy<br />that can pulse.
6426884 6429120 TARS: Just when did this probe<br />become a "he," Professor?
6429954 6431623 TARS is the obvious candidate.
6432757 6434924 I've already told him<br />what to look for.
6434959 6437495 TARS: I need the old optical<br />transmitter off KIPP, Cooper.
6437528 6438963 You'd do this for us?
6438996 6440331 TARS: Before<br />you get all teary,
6440364 6441575 try to remember that as a robot
6441599 6442800 I have to do anything you say.
6443801 6445469 Your cue light's broken.
6445503 6446871 TARS: I'm not joking.
6449941 6451575 I'm gonna need TARS<br />to remove and adapt
6451608 6453310 some components from KIPP.
6453343 6455646 Well, I don't want to disturb<br />his archival functions.
6455679 6456981 ROMILLY: Oh, I'll supervise.
6457414 6458883 All right.
6458916 6461519 Dr. Mann, we need to find<br />three secure sites.
6461552 6463988 One for Brand's lab,<br />two for habitat.
6464021 6466199 Once those modules<br />have landed, you don't<br />want to move 'em.
6466223 6467534 Well, I can take you<br />to the probe sites,
6467558 6468892 but I don't think this...
6468926 6470361 These conditions are gonna hold.
6470394 6471828 I think we should wait.
6471862 6473163 COOPER: CASE is<br />headed back down
6473197 6474999 with the rest<br />of the distillery equipment.
6475032 6477335 I'd really like to secure<br />those sites by nightfall.
6479670 6482340 Well, these squalls<br />do usually blow over.
6483040 6484509 Okay then.
6484542 6486653 - But you're gonna need a long-range transmitter.<br />- Got it.
6486677 6488012 - Are you charged?<br />- Yeah.
6488578 6489578 Follow me.
6490515 6492883 TARS, 72 hours, yeah?
6492916 6494052 TARS: Roger that, Cooper.
6500792 6503261 DR. MANN: Brand told me why<br />you feel you have to go back.
6505395 6508332 But I'd be remiss if I didn't<br />at least mention that
6508366 6509734 a mission such as ours
6509767 6512270 could certainly use<br />an extra engineer.
6513103 6514438 (BEEPING)
6514472 6516841 You better slow down, turbo.
6516874 6518342 Safety first, CASE, remember.
6519510 6520910 CASE ON RADIO:<br />Safety first, Cooper.
6522246 6523714 COOPER: I have to<br />tell you, Dr. Mann,
6523748 6525649 I'm honored to be<br />a part of this.
6525683 6528018 But once we set up base camp
6528052 6530354 and secure those modules,<br />my work's done here.
6531122 6532155 I'm going home.
6540498 6542566 You have attachments.
6542600 6544601 But even without a family, I can
6544635 6546470 promise you that, that yearning
6546504 6548773 to be with other<br />people is powerful.
6549707 6553843 That emotion<br />is at the foundation
6553877 6556114 of what makes us human.<br />It's not to be taken lightly.

6564822 6565790 How long have you<br />had that cough?
6565823 6566990 LOIS: A while.
6577868 6579437 COOP: Mom lets me<br />play in here.
6581105 6582339 I don't touch your stuff.
6613704 6615206 Just take this gently.
6620878 6622322 DR. MANN: You know why we<br />couldn't just send machines
6622346 6624714 on these missions,<br />don't you, Cooper?
6624748 6626717 (PANTING) A machine<br />doesn't improvise well
6626750 6628953 because you can't program<br />a fear of death.
6630187 6632657 Our survival instinct<br />is our single greatest
6632690 6635459 source of inspiration.<br />Take you, for example.
6636693 6638896 A father
6638929 6641432 with a survival instinct<br />that extends to your kids.
6642933 6645570 What does research tell us<br />is the last thing
6645603 6647238 you're going to see<br />before you die?
6649407 6652075 Your children. Their faces.
6652109 6654744 At the moment of death,<br />your mind's gonna push
6654778 6656247 a little bit harder to survive.
6656880 6658182 For them.
6658949 6660484 - Deep breath.<br />- (COOP COUGHING)
6662586 6664021 Uh, hey, I bet you're Coop.

6666723 6668626 It's bad.<br />They cannot stay here.
6669726 6670726 - Okay?<br />- Yeah.

6708832 6710634 that my planet wasn't the one.
6713837 6715973 Nothing worked out the way<br />it was supposed to.

6796053 6798188 that this place had nothing.
6798221 6801392 And I resisted<br />the temptation for years,

8032188 8033623 around Gargantua,

8036726 8038795 and Ranger 2<br />as rocket boosters to

8838527 8840104 You've seen that time<br />is represented here
8840128 8842364 as a physical dimension.
8842397 8844099 You have worked out<br />that you can exert
8844132 8845867 a force across spacetime.
8845900 8848804 Gravity... To send a message.
8849671 8850806 Affirmative.
8853508 8854543 Gravity
8856078 8858680 can cross the dimensions,<br />including time.
8859548 8860649 Apparently.
8864819 8867055 Do you have the quantum data?
8867089 8868523 Roger. I have it.
8869992 8872059 I am transmitting it<br />on all wavelengths,
8872094 8873895 but nothing is getting out,<br />Cooper.
8873928 8876465 I can do this. I can do this.
8876498 8878967 But such complicated data<br />to a child?
8879000 8880235 Not just any child.
8880735 8881837 What else?
8882571 8883839 Oh, come on, Dad.
8887175 8889211 Murph, the fire's out!<br />Come on!
8889244 8891013 Even if you communicate it here,
8891046 8894014 she won't understand<br />its significance for years.
8894049 8895951 I get that, TARS. All right?
8895984 8897952 But we've got to<br />figure something out
8897986 8899129 or the people on Earth<br />are gonna die.
8899153 8900555 Think, think, think!
8900589 8902522 Cooper,
8902557 8904827 they didn't bring us here<br />to change the past.
8908197 8910298 Say that again.
8910332 8913202 They didn't bring us here<br />to change the past.
8918006 8920142 No, they didn't bring us<br />here at all.
8924746 8926348 We brought ourselves.
8935456 8938360 COOPER: TARS, give me<br />the coordinates for NASA
8938393 8940162 in binary.
8940195 8942231 TARS: In binary. Roger.<br />Feeding data.
8966755 8968457 "It's not a ghost."
8970292 8972360 "It's gravity."
8972394 8974595 COOPER: (PANTING)<br />Don't you get it yet, TARS?
8974630 8976298 I brought myself here!
8977599 8980669 We're here to communicate with<br />a three-dimensional world.
8981135 8982638 We're the bridge!
8990812 8992346 I thought they chose me.
8996117 8998053 But they didn't choose me,<br />they chose her.
8998086 8999138 TARS: For what, Cooper?
8999139 9000189 (LAUGHS)
9002057 9003559 To save the world.
9008129 9010899 All of this<br />is one little girl's bedroom.
9010932 9012500 Every moment.
9012534 9014369 It's infinitely complex.
9014402 9016638 They have access<br />to infinite time and space,
9016672 9019241 but they're not<br />bound by anything!
9019274 9022444 They can't find<br />a specific place in time.
9022477 9023745 They can't communicate.
9025614 9028316 That's why I'm here. I'm gonna<br />find a way to tell Murph,
9028349 9030085 just like I found this moment.
9030118 9031185 TARS: How, Cooper?
9031219 9032754 Love, TARS, love.
9032787 9035089 It's just like Brand said.<br />My connection with Murph,
9035123 9037292 it is quantifiable.<br />It's the key!
9037325 9038927 TARS: What are we here to do?
9039995 9040996 Find how to tell her.
9044665 9045767 The watch.
9049070 9050405 The watch.
9051673 9052808 That's it.
9055677 9058347 We code the data into the<br />movement of the second hand.
9062350 9065487 TARS, translate the data<br />into Morse and feed it to me.
9065520 9067354 TARS: Translating data<br />into Morse.
9067389 9069658 Cooper, what if she<br />never came back for it?
9071259 9073795 She will. She will.
9075397 9076637 GETTY: Murph,<br />I can see his car!
9078100 9079300 He's coming, Murph!
9081069 9082738 Okay. I'm coming down.
9084339 9085741 TARS: How do you know?
9089177 9090746 Because I gave it to her.
9096584 9098754 TARS: Roger.<br />Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.
9102224 9103424 COOPER: Dot-dot-
9104792 9106295 dash-dot.
9106961 9108997 TARS: Dot-dash-dot-dot.
9109030 9112000 COOPER: Dot-dash-dot-dot.
9112033 9113802 TARS: Dash-dash-dash.
9113835 9115837 COOPER: Dash-dash-dash.
9126781 9127783 (GASPS)
9134188 9136558 MURPH: He came back!
9136591 9140095 It was him all this time!<br />I didn't know. It was him!
9141897 9143432 Dad's gonna save us.
9186207 9187509 Eureka!
9191312 9192646 It's traditional.
9195517 9198687 (LAUGHING) Eureka!
9203425 9205460 Did it work?
9205493 9207028 TARS: I think it might have.
9208363 9209964 How do you know?
9209998 9213034 TARS: Because the bulk beings<br />are closing the tesseract.
9217238 9219040 Don't you get it yet, TARS?
9220275 9221877 They're not "beings."
9222844 9223979 They're us.
9226615 9229518 What I've been doing for<br />Murph, they're doing for me.
9229917 9231686 For all of us.
9231719 9234055 TARS: Cooper,<br />people couldn't build this.
9234088 9236323 COOPER: No. No, not yet.
9236357 9237592 But one day.
9238793 9241630 Not you and me. But a people.
9243064 9244732 A civilization that's evolved
9244766 9246935 past the four dimensions<br />we know.
9246968 9248737 (BREATHING HEAVILY)
9253407 9254876 COOPER: What happens now?
9317471 9318874 DOCTOR: Mr. Cooper.
9323210 9325279 Let's take it slow, sir.
9325312 9327716 Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.
9327749 9329650 Remember, you're<br />no spring chicken anymore.
9329684 9331887 Actually, you are 124 years old.
9336191 9338126 (PEOPLE PLAYING BASEBALL<br />OUTSIDE)
9339527 9340929 Take it slow, sir.
9342129 9344699 You were extremely lucky.
9344732 9346277 The Rangers found you<br />with only minutes left
9346301 9347836 in your oxygen supply.
9356110 9357112 (GLASS SHATTERING)
9358613 9360582 (CHEERING AND LAUGHING)
9362016 9363151 Where am I?
9365186 9366721 DOCTOR: Cooper Station.
9368222 9369324 Currently orbiting Saturn.
9371493 9373228 Cooper Station.
9376331 9378165 Nice of you to name it after me.
9378199 9379200 (LAUGHS)
9381903 9383437 What?
9383471 9384815 The station<br />isn't named after you, sir.
9384839 9386841 It's named after your daughter.
9386875 9388643 Although she's always maintained
9388676 9390144 just how important you were.
9390177 9391680 Is she still alive?
9393547 9394827 She'll be here<br />in a couple weeks.
9396551 9397885 She is far too old
9397918 9399162 to be transferring<br />from another station,
9399186 9401690 but when she heard<br />that you'd been found...
9402691 9403891 Well, this is...
9403924 9405564 This is Murphy Cooper<br />we're talking about.
9406394 9407696 Yes, it is.
9410465 9412968 DOCTOR: We'll have you checked<br />out of here in a couple days.
9415303 9417638 I'm sure you'll be excited<br />to see what's in store.
9419240 9423444 I actually did a paper on you<br />in high school.
9423477 9425614 I know all about your life<br />back on Earth.
9427281 9428283 Oh, yeah.
9428583 9429818 Right.
9432753 9434055 If you'll follow me,
9434088 9436958 we've got a really<br />good situation for you.
9441162 9444398 So, um, when I made<br />my suggestion to Ms. Cooper,
9446200 9448403 I was delighted to hear that<br />she thought it was perfect.
9452073 9453317 OLD WOMAN 1:<br />It was just constant.
9453341 9455877 Just that steady blow of dirt.
9455910 9458780 Of course, I didn't<br />speak to her personally.
9458813 9460815 We always<br />set the plate upside-down.
9460848 9464050 Glasses or cups,<br />whatever it was, upside-down.
9464085 9468956 My dad was a farmer.<br />Like everybody else<br />back then.
9468989 9471826 There just wasn't enough food.
9471859 9474428 OLD WOMAN 2: We wore<br />little things, little strips
9474462 9478666 of sheet, put it sometimes<br />over our nose and mouth,
9478700 9480010 so we wouldn't<br />breathe so much of it.
9480034 9483271 Well, it was pretty exciting<br />for me because it was hope.
9483304 9485206 OLD MAN: I don't care<br />who describes it,
9485240 9487742 there is no way for it to be<br />exaggerated. It was that bad.
9487775 9489510 ADMINISTRATOR:<br />She did confirm
9489544 9491679 just how much you loved farming.
9491712 9493414 - Oh, she did, did she?<br />- Yeah.
9493448 9495216 Here we are.
9495250 9496950 Home sweet home.
9496984 9499854 Everything replaced<br />and put back where it...
9506461 9507528 Hey, is this...
9507561 9509130 Oh, yeah.
9509163 9511966 The machine we found<br />out near Saturn<br />when we found you, yes.
9511999 9513701 Its power source was shot,
9513735 9515045 but we could get you<br />another one if you want it.
9515069 9516471 Yes. Please.
9518239 9519374 TARS: Settings.
9520174 9522143 General settings.
9522176 9523478 Security settings.
9526748 9528450 Honesty, new setting,
9530084 9532119 95%.
9532153 9534255 TARS: Confirmed.<br />Additional customization?
9535356 9536357 Humor,
9538125 9539260 75%.
9539861 9541896 TARS: Confirmed.
9541929 9545265 Auto self-destruct<br />T minus 10, nine...
9545300 9546935 Let's make that 60%.
9549503 9551306 TARS: 60% confirmed.
9552306 9553440 Knock-knock.
9553474 9554908 You want 55?
9560181 9562350 TARS: Is this really<br />what it was like?
9564719 9566988 It was never this clean,<br />Slick. (CHUCKLES)
9571426 9573260 I don't care much for this
9573294 9574929 pretending we're back<br />where we started.
9577365 9579200 I want to know where we are.
9581236 9582403 Where we're going.
9587208 9589511 Mr. Cooper.<br />The family's all in there.
9590444 9591779 Family?
9591813 9593246 Yeah, they all came out<br />to see her.
9593281 9595283 She's been in cryo-sleep<br />for almost two years.
9612132 9613168 (SOBBING)
9628682 9630451 You told 'em I like farming.
9631251 9632387 (LAUGHING)
9636457 9637925 It was me, Murph.
9640661 9642197 I was your ghost.
9643631 9644966 I know.
9647135 9648903 People didn't believe me.
9648936 9651406 They thought that<br />I was doing it all myself.
9652040 9653074 But...
9655810 9657345 I knew who it was.
9662783 9664352 Nobody believed me.
9665619 9667388 But I knew you'd come back.
9670224 9671226 How?
9673694 9676231 Because my dad promised me.
9682770 9684505 Well, I'm here now, Murph.
9685806 9687108 I'm here.
9688709 9689911 No.
9692546 9695916 No parent should have to<br />watch their own child die.
9699287 9701322 I have my kids here for me now.
9704525 9705660 You go.
9709363 9710398 Where?
9714368 9715536 Brand.
9725146 9726948 She's out there,
9733120 9734589 setting up camp.
9761882 9763184 Alone
9764885 9766720 in a strange galaxy.
9778533 9782737 Maybe right now she's<br />settling in for the long nap
9801289 9803624 by the light of our new sun
9819573 9821274 in our new home.
