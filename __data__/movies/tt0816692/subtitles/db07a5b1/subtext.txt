80776 82604 OLD WOMAN:<br /><i>Well, my dad was a farmer.</i>
83953 86303 Um... Like everybody else<br />back then.
88566 90525 <i>Of course,</i><br /><i>he didn't start that way.</i>
96531 97836 MAN ON RADIO: <i>Computer</i><br /><i>says you're too tight.</i>
98533 100143 Nah, I got this.
100187 101405 <i>Crossing the Straits.</i>

105714 107107 [POWERING DOWN]
107150 108499 <i>Shutting it all down.</i>
108543 109587 No, I need power up!
112329 113939 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE: <i>Eject!</i>[COOPER SCREAMING]
113983 115158 YOUNG MURPH: Dad?
121556 124298 Sorry, Murph.<br />Go back to bed, babe.
124341 126126 I thought you were the ghost.
126387 127388 No.
128650 130956 There are no such things<br />as ghosts, babe.
131000 132654 Grandpa says<br />you can get ghosts.
134351 136440 Yeah, maybe that's 'cause<br />Grandpa's a little too close
136484 139443 to being one himself.<br />Back to bed.
139487 141315 Were you dreaming<br />about the crash?
142751 145145 Get your butt back in bed,<br />Murph. [LAUGHS]
172084 174391 OLD MURPH: <i>The wheat had died.</i>
174435 177307 <i>The blight came</i><br /><i>and we had to burn it.</i>
177351 180441 <i>And we still had corn.</i><br /><i>We had acres of corn.</i>
180484 182660 But, uh, mostly we had dust.
185272 186838 OLD WOMAN 1:<br /><i>I guess I can't describe it.</i>
186882 187926 <i>It was just constant.</i>
187970 190668 Just that steady blow
190712 191756 <i>of dirt.</i>
194194 197197 OLD WOMAN 2: <i>We wore</i><br /><i>little strips of sheet</i>
197240 200025 sometimes over<br />our nose and mouth
200069 202376 <i>so that we wouldn't breathe </i><br /><i>so much of it.</i>
204160 206989 OLD MAN: <i>Well,</i><br /><i>when we set the table,</i><br /><i>we always set the plate</i>
207032 208033 upside-down.
208077 210035 Glasses or cups,<br />whatever it was,
210079 211298 <i>upside-down.</i>
216520 219262 Shake a leg!<br />Murph, get a move on!
219306 220872 COOPER: Tom, 4:00 today,<br />you and me in the barn,
220916 222657 Herbicide Resistance 101.
222700 224354 Check?Yes, sir.
224398 225703 [INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO][DONALD HUMMING]
225747 227009 Not at the table, Murph.
228053 229664 Dad, can you fix this?
231579 232841 COOPER: What the heck<br />did you do to my lander?
232884 234234 Wasn't me.
234277 236279 Let me guess.<br />It was your ghost?
236323 237498 It knocked it off my shelf.
237541 239064 It keeps on<br />knocking books off.
239108 240370 TOM: No such thing as ghosts,<br />dumb-ass.
240414 241719 Hey.I looked it up.
241763 242851 It's called a poltergeist.
242894 244244 Dad, tell her.
244287 246550 Well, it's not<br />very scientific, Murph.
246594 249074 You said science was about<br />admitting what we don't know.
249118 251076 She's got you there.COOPER: Hey.
251120 252774 Start looking after our stuff.
254079 255342 Coop.
257822 260303 All right, Murph,<br />you want to talk science?
261652 263393 Don't just tell me that<br />you're afraid of some ghost.
263437 265090 No, you got to go further.
265134 266483 You got to record<br />the facts, analyze,
266527 268224 get to the how and the why,
268268 270835 then present your conclusions.<br />Deal?
271880 273360 Deal.All right.
276014 277059 Y'all have<br />a good day at school.
277102 278539 DONALD: Hold up.
278582 281063 Parent-teacher conferences.<br />Parent.
281106 282630 Not grandparent.
283152 284371 [HONKING HORN]

293162 295338 They're saying it's<br />the last harvest for okra.
296296 297471 Ever.
299560 302345 He should've planted corn<br />like the rest of us.
302389 304086 Now, you be nice<br />to that Ms. Hanley.
304129 305130 She's single.
305174 306784 What's that supposed to mean?
306828 308177 Repopulating the Earth.
308220 310353 Start pulling your weight,<br />young man.
310397 312616 Well, why don't you start<br />minding your own business,
313008 314096 old man.
321408 322713 All right, Murph,<br />give me second.
324759 325760 Uh-huh.
326238 327544 Third.
328066 329372 [GEARS GRINDING]
329416 331156 Find a gear, dumb-ass.Grind it!
331200 332244 Shut it, Tom!
332288 333376 [TIRE HISSING]
333420 334595 What'd you do, Murph?
334638 335987 Aw, she didn't do nothin'.
336031 337859 Blew a tire is all.
337902 338903 Murphy's Law.
339295 340383 Shut up!
340427 341689 Grab the spare, Tom.
341732 342864 That is the spare.
345301 346563 COOPER: Get the patch kit!
347956 350001 TOM: How am I supposed<br />to patch it out here?
350045 351481 COOPER:<br />You got to figure it out.
351525 353091 I'm not always gonna be here<br />to help you.
361926 363885 What's going on, Murph?
363928 367062 Why did you and Mom name me<br />after something that's bad?
367105 368368 Well, we didn't.
368846 370065 Murphy's Law?
371588 375810 Murphy's Law doesn't mean that<br />something bad will happen.
375853 379291 What it means is whatever<br />can happen will happen.
379335 381468 And that sounded<br />just fine with us.
385907 386908 Whoa!
388257 389563 Get in.
390520 391869 Get in, let's go.
393393 394481 What about the flat tire?
394524 395743 [ENGINE STARTING]
398659 399834 Yeah.
413717 415284 It's an Indian<br />Air Force drone.
415327 417939 Solar cells could power<br />an entire farm.
417982 419114 Take the wheel, Tom.
424946 426774 Go, go, go!
428036 429429 Keep that aimed right at it.
437524 439700 Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.
440788 441832 Right at it.
443443 444618 Stay on it.
446010 447447 Here we go. Here we go.
449623 450624 Whoa!
455977 457457 Nice one, Tom.
464159 465856 Dad?
465900 468772 I almost got it.<br />Don't stop. Don't stop!
469120 470121 Dad!
470644 471645 Tom!
476388 478173 Why? You told me<br />to keep driving.
479522 481045 Well, I guess that<br />answers the old,
481089 483744 "If I asked you to<br />drive off a cliff" scenario.
486964 488313 We lost it.
488357 489619 No, we didn't.
502545 503938 Want to give it a whirl?
509900 511511 This...
516951 518953 Go.
518996 522043 Let's lay her down<br />right there at the edge<br />of the reservoir.
526308 527875 Nicely done.
531139 533184 TOM: How long you think<br />it's been up there?
533228 535665 Delhi Mission Control<br />went down, same as ours,
535709 537058 10 years ago.Oh!
538059 539756 So for 10 years?
543238 544239 Why did it come down so low?
544282 545806 I don't know.
545849 547372 Maybe the sun<br />cooked its brain
547416 548460 or it was looking<br />for something.
548504 549679 What?
549723 551594 Give me a large flatblade.
551638 554292 Maybe some kind of signal?<br />I don't know.
559646 561996 What are you gonna do with it?
562039 564912 I'm gonna give it something<br />socially responsible to do,
564955 567784 [PANTING]<br />like drive a combine.
567828 569264 Can't we just let it go?
571483 572920 It wasn't hurting anybody.
574922 577577 This thing needs to learn<br />how to adapt, Murph,
577620 579361 like the rest of us.
584018 585715 COOPER: So how's this work?<br />You guys come with?
585759 587064 TOM: I've got class.
587108 589632 This one needs to wait.
590981 592243 What did you do?
592287 593680 They'll tell you about it<br />when you get in there.
593723 595159 Am I gonna be mad?
595203 596247 Not with me.
596291 597597 Just please try not to.
597640 599337 Hey, relax.
600991 602166 I got this.
606562 607998 Little late, Coop.
608042 609696 Yeah, we had a flat.
609739 611393 And I guess<br />you had to stop off
611436 613700 at the Asian<br />fighter plane store.
613743 617181 No, actually, sir, that's a...<br />That's a surveillance drone.
617225 619793 With outstanding solar cells.<br />It's Indian.
620315 621621 Take a seat.
623100 624885 So, uh...
624928 628105 We got Tom's scores back.
628149 630673 He's going to make<br />an excellent farmer.
630717 634024 Yeah, he's got<br />a knack for it.<br />What about college?
634068 636505 Well, the university<br />only takes a handful.
636548 637680 They don't really have<br />the resources to...
637724 640291 I still pay my taxes.
640335 642772 Where's that money go?<br />There's no more armies.
642816 645775 Well, it doesn't go<br />to the university.
645819 647690 Look, Coop,<br />you have to be realistic.
647734 650171 You're ruling my son out<br />for college now?
650693 652086 The kid's 15.
652129 654654 Tom's score simply<br />isn't high enough.
655524 657700 What's your waistline?<br />About 32?
657744 659789 About a 33 inseam?
659833 661704 I'm not sure I see<br />what you're getting at.
661748 662792 You're telling me<br />it takes two numbers
662836 664098 to measure your own ass,
664141 666491 but only one to measure<br />my son's future?
666535 668493 [SIGHS] Come on.
668537 670408 You're a well-educated man,<br />Coop.
670452 672889 And a trained pilot.And an engineer.
672933 677981 Okay, well, right now<br />we don't need<br />more engineers.
678025 680810 We didn't run out of<br />television screens<br />and planes.
680854 682769 We ran out of food.
682812 686120 The world needs farmers.<br />Good farmers, like you.
686163 687164 And Tom.
687208 688296 Uneducated farmers.
689601 691560 We're a caretaker<br />generation, Coop.
691603 693649 And things<br />are getting better.
693693 695216 Maybe your grandkids<br />will get to be engineers...
695259 696391 Are we done here, sir?
698262 699829 No.
699873 702745 Ms. Hanley's here<br />to talk about Murph.
702789 705313 MS. HANLEY: Murph is a great<br />kid. She's really bright.
705356 707010 But she's been having<br />a little trouble lately.
707054 709491 She brought this in<br />to show the other students.
709534 711058 The section<br />on the lunar landings.
711101 714017 Yeah, it's one<br />of my old textbooks.
714061 716367 She always loved<br />the pictures.
716411 717760 It's an old federal textbook.
717804 720023 We've replaced them<br />with the corrected versions.
720067 721503 Corrected?
721546 723548 Explaining how<br />the <i>Apollo</i>missions<br />were faked
723592 725289 to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
732209 734124 You don't believe<br />we went to the moon?
735343 737475 I believe it was a brilliant<br />piece of propaganda.
737519 740043 That the Soviets bankrupted<br />themselves pouring resources
740087 742567 into rockets<br />and other useless machines.
742611 743960 "Useless machines."
744004 745788 And if we don't want<br />a repeat of the excess
745832 748269 and wastefulness<br />of the 20th century, then
748312 750314 we need to teach our kids<br />about this planet,
750358 751881 not tales of leaving it.
752926 754449 You know, one of those<br />useless machines
754492 757147 they used to make<br />was called an MRI.
757191 759062 And if we had<br />any of those left,
759106 760629 the doctors would've<br />been able to find
760672 762239 the cyst in my wife's brain
762283 764764 before she died<br />instead of afterwards.
764807 765982 And then she'd have been<br />the one sitting here,
766026 767854 listening to this<br />instead of me,
767897 769203 which would have<br />been a good thing,
769246 770813 'cause she was always
771509 772946 the calmer one.
773816 775775 I'm sorry about your wife,<br />Mr. Cooper.
777080 779256 But Murph<br />got into a fistfight
779300 780780 with several of<br />her classmates over this
780823 782738 <i>Apollo</i>nonsense.
782782 783783 So we thought<br />it would be best
783826 785219 to bring you in<br />and see what ideas
785262 786698 you might have for<br />dealing with her behavior
786742 787830 on the homefront.
787874 789310 All right. [INHALES]
789353 792443 Yeah, you know what? Um...<br />There's a game tomorrow night.
792487 794924 She's going through<br />a bit of a baseball phase.
794968 797448 Her favorite team is playing,<br />and there's gonna be candy
797492 798798 and soda...
801931 803977 I think I'll take her to that.
807502 808851 [WHISTLING]
809634 811027 How'd it go?
811680 813638 I got you suspended.
813682 815336 What?BOOTS ON RADIO: <i>Cooper.</i>
816685 818165 This is Cooper, go.
818208 820950 <i>Coop, those combines</i><br /><i>you rebuilt went haywire.</i>
820994 823605 Uh, just reset<br />the controllers.
823648 826129 <i>I did that.</i><br /><i>You should</i><br /><i>come take a look.</i>
846280 847934 BOOTS: One by one they've been<br />peeling off the fields
847977 849283 and heading over.
849326 851328 Something's interfering<br />with the compass.
852677 855028 Magnetism or some such.
873742 875048 [CLATTERING]
898114 900290 YOUNG MURPH: Nothing special<br />about which book.
900334 902423 I've been working on it,<br />like you said.
903119 904381 I counted the spaces.
905078 906296 Why?
908081 909909 In case the ghost<br />is trying to communicate.
910910 912433 I'm trying Morse.
912781 914217 Morse?
914565 915827 Yeah.
915871 917133 Dots and dashes, used...
917177 918743 I know what<br />Morse code is, Murph.
918787 920006 I just don't think<br />your bookshelf's
920049 921485 trying to talk to you.
933280 935760 COOPER: Had to reset every<br />compass clock and GPS
935804 937719 to offset for the anomaly.
937762 938938 DONALD: Which is?
938981 940330 I don't know.
942158 944595 If the house was built<br />on magnetic ore,
944639 945857 we'd have seen this<br />the first time
945901 947468 we switched on the tractor.
950384 953430 I hear your meeting at<br />the school didn't go so well.
953474 956956 [SCOFFS] You heard?
956999 959480 It's like we've forgotten<br />who we are, Donald.
961221 964572 Explorers, pioneers,<br />not caretakers.
966748 967923 When I was a kid,
967967 969185 it felt like they made
969229 971144 something new every day.
971666 974669 Some gadget or idea.
974712 976236 Like every day<br />was Christmas.
976279 979500 But six billion people...
979543 981458 Just try to imagine that.
982633 985462 And every last one of them<br />trying to have it all.
987638 988944 [SIGHS]
988988 990685 This world isn't so bad.
993601 995255 And Tom will do just fine.
995298 997213 You're the one<br />who doesn't belong.
997257 999999 Born 40 years too late,<br />or 40 years too early.
1001043 1003437 My daughter knew it,<br />God bless her.
1004481 1007571 And your kids know it.<br />Especially Murph.
1007615 1011010 Well, we used to look up<br />in the sky and wonder
1011053 1013403 at our place in the stars.
1015840 1018017 Now we just look down
1018060 1020845 and worry about<br />our place in the dirt.
1020889 1024066 Cooper,<br />you were good at something
1024110 1026373 and you never got a chance<br />to do anything with it.
1027461 1028462 I'm sorry.
1030507 1034903 You didn't expect this dirt<br />that was giving you this food
1034946 1038211 to turn on you like that<br />and destroy you.
1038254 1042693 In April, I believe I'm right,<br />15th of April, I think.
1042737 1045435 'Cause this happened<br />about 1:30, when that thing
1045479 1047829 came off the top<br />of that canyon.
1047872 1049091 [CROWD CHEERING]
1049135 1051528 In my day,<br />we had real ballplayers.
1051572 1053443 Who are these bums?
1053487 1056098 COOPER: Well, in my day,<br />people were too busy
1056142 1058448 fighting over food<br />to even play baseball.
1058492 1061408 Popcorn at a ballgame<br />is unnatural.
1061930 1063192 I want a hot dog.
1063236 1065586 School says you're gonna<br />follow in my footsteps.
1066456 1068110 I think that's great.[SCOFFS]
1068154 1069807 You think that's great?
1069851 1071418 You hate farming, Dad.
1072114 1073768 Grandpa said.
1073811 1075857 Grandpa said, huh?
1075900 1078599 Listen, all that matters is<br />how you feel about it.
1078642 1080296 I like what you do.
1080905 1082429 I like our farm.
1083169 1084170 You're gonna<br />be great at it.
1084213 1085606 [CROWD CHEERING]
1092961 1094658 [SIREN BLARING]
1097879 1099402 Let's get out of here.
1106322 1108368 COOPER:<br />All right, it's a doozy.
1109108 1110805 Uh, gang, let's mask up.
1114287 1116376 Tom? Murph? Check?CHILDREN: Yep.
1169994 1172345 Murph, Tom,<br />you guys shut your windows?
1176523 1177741 Murph!
1199067 1200460 YOUNG MURPH: The ghost.
1201809 1203289 Grab your pillow.
1204072 1205813 You're sleeping in with Tom.
1260781 1262435 It's not a ghost.
1267962 1269311 [WHISPERING] It's gravity.
1271444 1273924 DONALD: I'm dropping Tom,<br />then heading to town.
1273968 1276100 You want to clean that up
1276144 1277972 when you're finished<br />praying to it?
1303476 1306174 It's not Morse, Murph.<br />It's binary.
1306217 1308611 Thick is one, thin is zero.
1312746 1314008 Coordinates.
1316619 1317968 Nope.
1318012 1319448 Mmm-mmm.
1320623 1321798 Here we go.
1323322 1324714 Thirty-three.
1327761 1328936 That's it.
1330024 1331852 I can't miss this![SIGHS]
1331895 1335638 Grandpa will be back<br />in a couple hours, Murph.
1335682 1338511 But you don't know<br />what you're gonna find.
1339686 1340774 And that
1341992 1343907 is why I can't take you.
1350218 1351350 Murph?
1353395 1354614 Grandpa will be home<br />in a while.
1354657 1356746 Tell him I'll call him<br />on the radio.
1362839 1364058 [YELPS]Jeez!
1365059 1366103 What are you doing?
1366147 1367409 [LAUGHING]
1367453 1369716 Oh, you think<br />this is funny? Huh?
1369759 1371979 You wouldn't be here<br />if it wasn't for me.
1373937 1375374 Make yourself useful.
1375417 1376766 [CONTINUES LAUGHING]
1439307 1440613 [SOFTLY] Hey, Murph?
1442353 1443529 Murph!
1446706 1449056 I think this is<br />the end of the road.
1452320 1454148 Didn't you bring<br />the bolt cutters?
1455454 1456803 That's my girl.
1484265 1485962 MALE GUARD: Step away<br />from the fence!No, no, no.
1486006 1487573 Don't shoot! Don't shoot!<br />I'm not armed.
1487616 1489052 My daughter's in the car.
1489096 1490706 [TASING]
1490750 1492142 [MECHANICAL FOOTSTEPS<br />APPROACHING]
1494754 1496538 MALE GUARD: Don't be afraid.[SCREAMS]
1509377 1511248 TARS: How did you<br />find this place?
1512293 1513816 Where's my daughter?
1513860 1515426 TARS: You had<br />the coordinates<br />for this facility
1515470 1516515 marked on your map.
1516558 1517777 Where did you get<br />those coordinates?
1517820 1519256 [SHOUTING]<br />Where's my daughter?
1519300 1520475 Don't make me<br />take you down again.
1520519 1522695 Sit down!
1522738 1525045 Oh, you still think<br />you're a Marine, pal?
1525088 1527874 Marines don't exist anymore.
1527917 1531268 And I got grunts like you<br />mowing my grass.
1531312 1533009 Where did you find<br />those coordinates?
1533053 1535925 But you don't look<br />much like a lawnmower.
1535969 1538580 Think I'll turn you into an<br />overqualified vacuum cleaner.
1538624 1540016 WOMAN: No, you won't.
1541627 1543542 TARS, back down, please.
1545065 1548590 You know, you're taking a risk<br />using ex-military as security.
1548634 1552594 They're old,<br />and their control units<br />are unpredictable.
1552638 1554814 It's what the government<br />could spare.
1554857 1556163 [PANTING]
1556206 1557817 Who are you?
1557860 1559601 Dr. Brand.
1559645 1562212 I knew a Dr. Brand once.<br />He was a professor.
1562256 1564301 What makes you think<br />I'm not?
1564345 1566608 Oh, wasn't near<br />as cute, either.
1566652 1567870 Please, Dr. Brand.
1567914 1570046 I don't have<br />any idea what this is.
1570090 1572614 Now I'm scared for<br />my daughter and<br />I want her by my side.
1572658 1573920 You give me that,
1573963 1575356 I'll tell you anything<br />you want to know.
1578707 1579882 Get the principals
1579926 1581710 and the girl in<br />the conference room, please.
1583146 1584278 Your daughter is fine.
1584626 1586410 Bright kid.
1586454 1588587 Must have a very smart mother.
1588630 1591154 It's pretty clear<br />you don't want any visitors.
1591198 1592765 So why don't you<br />just let us back up<br />from your fence
1592808 1595202 and we'll be on our way? Huh?
1595245 1596464 It's not that simple.
1596507 1597987 Well, sure, it is.
1598031 1599641 I don't know<br />anything about you.
1599685 1601774 I don't know<br />anything about this place.
1602513 1603863 Yes, you do.
1609564 1610826 Dad!
1613437 1614700 Hello, Cooper.
1615744 1617050 Professor Brand.
1618312 1621097 WILLIAMS: Explain to me<br />how you found this facility.
1621141 1623143 Kind of an accident.<br />We stumbled upon it.
1623186 1624797 We were on a salvage run...
1624840 1627626 You're sitting in the<br />best-kept secret in the world.
1627669 1631455 Nobody stumbles in here.<br />Nobody stumbles out.
1631499 1633457 PROFESSOR BRAND:<br />Cooper... Please.
1633501 1635285 Cooperate with these people.
1635634 1636896 Look.
1637810 1639942 It's kind of hard to explain.
1639986 1644686 We learned these coordinates<br />from an anomaly.
1644730 1646122 What sort of anomaly?
1646166 1648168 I hesitate to<br />term it supernatural,
1648211 1649778 [CHUCKLES] but it definitely<br />wasn't scientific.
1649822 1652476 You're going to have to be<br />specific, Mr. Cooper.
1652520 1653608 Right now.
1653652 1654957 It was gravity.
1658482 1660006 DOYLE: Um...
1660049 1661747 What sort of<br />gravitational anomaly?
1661790 1663139 Where was this?COOPER: Hey.
1663183 1664314 Now I'm real happy
1664358 1666708 'cause you're excited<br />about gravity, bud,
1666752 1668144 but you're not getting<br />any answers from us
1668188 1669406 until I get assurances.
1669450 1671104 Assurances?Yeah.
1672061 1673802 Like that we're<br />getting out of here.
1673846 1675674 And I don't mean<br />in the trunk of some car.
1675717 1677197 [ALL LAUGHING]
1678024 1680287 Don't you know<br />who we are, Coop?
1680330 1681810 No, Professor, I don't.
1681854 1683769 BRAND: You know my father,<br />Professor Brand.
1684378 1685814 We're NASA.
1687381 1688556 NASA?
1688599 1689862 PROFESSOR BRAND: NASA.
1689905 1692038 The same NASA you flew for.
1702962 1704746 COOPER: I heard<br />they shut you down, sir,
1704790 1706879 for refusing to drop bombs<br />from the stratosphere
1706922 1709011 onto starving people.
1709055 1711274 When they realized that<br />killing other people was
1711318 1714538 not a long-term solution,<br />then they needed us back.
1714582 1716758 In secret.Why secret?
1716802 1718499 Because public opinion<br />wouldn't allow
1718542 1720457 spending on<br />space exploration.
1720501 1723069 Not when you're struggling<br />to put food on the table.
1724505 1726202 Blight.
1726246 1730772 Wheat seven years ago.<br />Okra this year.
1730816 1732992 Now there's just corn.
1733035 1734907 And we're growing<br />more than we ever have.
1734950 1737039 But like the potatoes<br />in Ireland
1737083 1739085 and the wheat<br />in the Dust Bowl,
1739607 1742175 the corn will die.
1743132 1744133 Soon.
1749443 1753795 We'll find a way, Professor.<br />We always have.
1753839 1758234 Driven by the unshakeable<br />faith the Earth is ours.
1758278 1760149 Well, not just ours, no.
1760802 1762195 But it is our home.
1763587 1767026 Earth's atmosphere<br />is 80% nitrogen.
1767069 1768810 We don't even<br />breathe nitrogen.
1768854 1771160 Blight does.<br />And as it thrives,
1771204 1774424 our air gets<br />less and less oxygen.
1774468 1775904 The last people to starve
1775948 1778080 will be the first<br />to suffocate.
1778124 1780213 And your<br />daughter's generation
1781954 1784217 will be the last<br />to survive on Earth.
1784260 1786001 BRAND: Murph is feeling<br />a little tired.
1786045 1787786 I was wondering if she could<br />take a nap in my office.
1788308 1789831 Yeah. Thank you.
1792573 1793792 Okay.
1794662 1795968 Now you need to tell me
1796011 1797970 what your plan is<br />to save the world.
1798927 1801321 We're not meant<br />to save the world.
1801364 1802496 We're meant to leave it.
1808371 1809372 COOPER: Rangers.
1809416 1810852 PROFESSOR BRAND:<br />The last components
1810896 1814551 of our one versatile ship<br />in orbit, the <i>Endurance.</i>
1814595 1817076 Our final expedition.
1817119 1820688 You sent people out there<br />looking for a new home?
1820731 1822298 The Lazarus missions.
1822342 1823560 Oh, that sounds cheerful.
1823604 1825649 Lazarus came back<br />from the dead.
1825693 1828130 Sure, but he had to die<br />in the first place.
1828174 1830306 There's not a planet<br />in our solar system
1830350 1831525 that could sustain life
1831568 1833875 and the nearest star's<br />over 1,000 years away.
1833919 1836182 And that doesn't even<br />qualify as futile.
1838401 1839402 Where'd you send 'em?
1839838 1841361 Cooper,
1841404 1844494 I can't tell you any more<br />unless you agree
1844538 1846496 to pilot this craft.
1846540 1847933 You're the best pilot<br />we ever had.
1847976 1849935 I barely left<br />the stratosphere.
1849978 1852502 This team never<br />left the simulator.
1852546 1853939 We need a pilot,
1853982 1856593 and this is the mission<br />that you were trained for.
1856637 1858987 Without even knowing it?
1859031 1861294 An hour ago, you didn't even<br />know I was alive.
1861337 1863165 You were going anyway.
1863731 1865559 We had no choice.
1865602 1867343 But something sent you here.
1867387 1868823 They chose you.
1868867 1870042 Who's "they"?
1878441 1880313 How long would I be gone?
1880748 1882054 Hard to know.
1882532 1883533 Years?
1884534 1885666 I've got kids, Professor.
1886754 1888669 Get out there and save them.
1891933 1893413 Who's "they"?
1893456 1895937 We started detecting<br />gravitational anomalies
1895981 1897896 almost 50 years ago.
1897939 1899854 Mostly small distortions<br />to our instruments
1899898 1901203 in the upper atmosphere.
1901247 1904424 In fact, I believe<br />you encountered one yourself.
1905425 1907122 Yeah, over the Straits.
1908254 1909559 My crash.
1909603 1911257 Something tripped<br />my fly-by-wire.
1911300 1913433 Exactly.
1913476 1918394 But of all these anomalies,<br />the most significant is this.
1918438 1919569 Out near Saturn,
1920788 1922616 a disturbance of spacetime.
1924835 1926054 Is that a wormhole?
1926098 1928361 It appeared 48 years ago.
1928404 1930450 And it leads where?
1930885 1932452 Another galaxy.
1934236 1936717 A wormhole's not a naturally<br />occurring phenomenon.
1936760 1938284 Someone placed it there.
1938849 1940939 "They"?Mmm-hmm.
1940982 1942941 And whoever they are,
1942984 1945291 they appear to be<br />looking out for us.
1945334 1948120 That wormhole<br />lets us travel<br />to other stars.
1948163 1950209 It came along<br />right as we needed it.
1950252 1951819 They've put potentially<br />habitable worlds
1951862 1953342 right within our reach.
1953386 1955736 Twelve, in fact,<br />from our initial probes.
1955779 1957999 You sent probes into that?Mmm-hmm.
1958043 1961220 We sent people into it.<br />Ten years ago.
1962177 1964310 The Lazarus missions.
1964353 1965964 PROFESSOR BRAND:<br />Twelve possible worlds,
1966007 1968401 12 Ranger launches<br />carrying
1968444 1971056 the bravest humans<br />ever to live,
1971099 1973972 led by the remarkable<br />Dr. Mann.
1974015 1975408 Each person's landing pod
1975451 1977323 had enough life support<br />for two years.
1977366 1979325 But they could<br />use hibernation<br />to stretch that,
1979368 1981153 making observations<br />on organics
1981196 1982893 over a decade or more.
1982937 1985113 Their mission was<br />to assess their world,
1985157 1986985 and if it showed potential,
1987028 1988595 then they could<br />send out a signal,
1988638 1991467 bed down for the long nap,<br />wait to be rescued.
1991511 1993426 And what if the world<br />didn't show promise?
1994644 1996472 Hence the bravery.
1996516 1999127 You don't have the resources<br />to visit all 12.
1999519 2001303 No.
2001347 2004176 Data transmission back through<br />the wormhole is rudimentary.
2004219 2006352 Simple binary pings<br />on an annual basis
2006395 2009311 give us some clue as to<br />which worlds have potential.
2009355 2011574 And one system shows promise.
2011618 2013794 One. That's a bit of<br />a long shot, isn't it?
2015013 2018059 One system with<br />three potential worlds?
2018103 2019539 [CHUCKLES]<br />No long shot.
2021758 2022759 Okay.
2023891 2025806 So if we find a home,
2028896 2030071 then what?
2030115 2032595 That's the long shot.
2032639 2036251 There's a Plan A and a Plan B.
2036295 2037861 Did you notice<br />anything strange
2037905 2039385 about the launch chamber?
2051136 2054182 COOPER: This entire facility's<br />a centrifuge.
2054226 2056837 Some kind of vehicle.<br />A space station?
2056880 2059013 PROFESSOR BRAND:<br />Both. Plan A.
2059057 2061276 How do you get it<br />off the ground?
2061320 2065324 The first gravitational<br />anomalies changed everything.
2065367 2069893 Suddenly we knew that<br />harnessing gravity was real.
2069937 2072418 So I started<br />working on a theory
2072461 2074898 and we started<br />building this station.
2074942 2076726 But you haven't<br />solved it yet.
2078119 2079599 That's why<br />there's Plan B.
2080121 2082167 The problem is gravity.
2082210 2085083 How to get a viable amount of<br />human life off the planet.
2085126 2086649 This is one way.
2086693 2089609 Plan B: a population bomb.
2089652 2091915 Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
2091959 2094092 weighing in at<br />just under 900 kilos.
2095093 2096485 Well, how would you raise 'em?
2096529 2099140 With equipment on board,<br />we incubate the first 10.
2099184 2101186 After that,<br />with surrogacy,
2101229 2102796 the growth<br />becomes exponential.
2103971 2105277 Within 30 years,
2105320 2107148 we could have<br />a colony of hundreds.
2107192 2109281 The real difficulty<br />with colonization
2109324 2111239 is genetic diversity.
2111283 2113111 This takes care of that.
2113154 2114851 But what about<br />the people here?<br />You just...
2115983 2117376 You give up on 'em?
2117854 2119117 My kids?
2119943 2122772 That's why Plan A<br />is a lot more fun.
2125297 2126950 How far have you got?
2126994 2128169 Almost there.
2128213 2130432 You're asking me<br />to hang everything
2131999 2133348 on an almost.
2133392 2135568 I'm asking you to trust me.
2137526 2139180 [SIGHS]
2139224 2140703 Find us a new home.
2141356 2144098 And by the time you return,
2144142 2146361 I will have solved<br />the problem of gravity.
2147971 2149364 I give you my word.
2161811 2162943 YOUNG MURPH: Go away!
2171125 2172431 [SIGHING]
2174172 2175260 Murph.
2175303 2178176 Go! If you're leaving,<br />just go.
2181048 2183746 DONALD: This world was never<br />enough for you, was it, Coop?
2184878 2186401 What, because<br />heading out there
2186445 2188403 is what I feel like<br />I was born to do?
2189361 2191189 And it excites me?
2192233 2194888 No, that does not<br />make it wrong.
2194931 2196324 DONALD: It might.
2196368 2198979 Don't trust the right thing<br />done for the wrong reason.
2200285 2202374 The why of the thing,<br />that's the foundation.
2202417 2204419 And the foundation's solid.
2207683 2210251 We farmers,<br />we sit here every year
2210295 2213080 when the rains fail<br />and we say,
2213123 2214342 "Next year."
2215256 2216823 Well, next year<br />ain't gonna save us,
2216866 2218477 nor the one after that.
2219434 2220870 This world's<br />a treasure, Donald,
2220914 2223438 but it's been telling us<br />to leave for a while now.
2228356 2230140 Mankind was born on Earth,
2230184 2231925 it was never meant<br />to die here.
2235407 2236625 Tom will be all right,
2236669 2238714 but you got to<br />make things right<br />with Murph.
2238758 2239759 I will.
2240934 2243676 Without making promises<br />you don't know you can keep.
2254426 2256341 You have to talk to me, Murph.
2259082 2261433 I need to fix this<br />before I go.
2261476 2263913 Then I'll keep it broken<br />so you have to stay.
2266046 2268309 After you kids came along,<br />your mom,
2268353 2270877 she said something to me<br />I never quite understood.
2271312 2272835 She said, "Now,
2274620 2278928 "we're just here to be<br />memories for our kids."
2284543 2286632 And I think now I understand<br />what she meant.
2290462 2291724 Once you're a parent,
2291767 2294030 you're the ghost<br />of your children's future.
2295554 2297643 [SNIFFLES] You said<br />ghosts didn't exist.
2304476 2305825 That's right, Murph.
2309350 2310699 Murph, look at me.
2313659 2315835 I can't be<br />your ghost right now.
2318011 2319752 I need to exist.
2321406 2323364 They chose me.
2324234 2325758 Murph, they chose me.
2325801 2327934 You saw. You're the one<br />who led me to 'em.
2331024 2333026 That's exactly<br />why you can't go.
2336595 2338988 I figured out the message.
2339032 2341382 One word. Know what it is?
2342296 2343558 "Stay."
2344124 2346300 It says, "Stay," Dad.
2346344 2347867 [WHISPERS] Murph.
2347910 2349434 You don't believe me.
2349477 2352480 Look at the books!<br />Look at this. It says, "Stay."
2352524 2355831 Why... You're not listening!<br />It says, "Stay!"
2355875 2357703 No, I'm coming back.
2358051 2359400 When?
2362447 2363709 [SNIFFLES]
2364753 2366146 [KISSES]
2372370 2374894 One for you, one for me.
2374937 2378637 When I'm up there<br />in hypersleep, or...<br />[SNIFFLES]
2378680 2380900 Or traveling<br />near the speed of light,
2382162 2384817 or near a black hole,
2384860 2388951 time's gonna change for me.<br />It's gonna run more slowly.
2391084 2392694 When we get back,
2394000 2395436 we're gonna compare.
2395480 2397133 YOUNG MURPH: Time will<br />run differently for us?
2397177 2398178 [WHISPERS] Yeah.
2399092 2400398 By the time I get back,
2400441 2403531 we might even be<br />the same age, you and me.
2404314 2406534 "What?" Imagine that!
2410930 2412453 Aw, Murph...
2412497 2414760 You have no idea<br />when you're coming back.
2416718 2418590 No idea at all![CLATTERS]
2418633 2420200 Murphy...[SOBBING]
2421506 2423464 Murph, don't make me<br />leave like this.
2423508 2425553 Come on, Murph!
2425597 2427729 Don't make me leave<br />like this, Murph!
2431341 2432952 [YOUNG MURPH<br />CONTINUES SOBBING]
2435781 2437260 Hey...
2437304 2438914 I love you.
2438958 2441482 Forever. You hear me?
2441526 2444224 I love you forever.<br />And I'm coming back.
2450186 2451579 I'm coming back.
2469858 2471120 How'd it go?
2471164 2472252 COOPER: It went fine.
2472295 2473558 Just fine.
2480913 2481914 I love you, Tom.
2482523 2484525 Travel safe, yeah?Yeah.
2484569 2486222 You look after our place<br />for me, all right?
2487006 2488268 All right?Uh-huh.
2493534 2494883 Hey, can I use your truck<br />while you're gone?
2494927 2496581 You mean your truck?
2497843 2499671 I'll make sure<br />they bring it back.
2500585 2501760 [ENGINE STARTS]
2501803 2503588 Look after my kids, Donald!
2516514 2518037 TARS: <i>Go for</i><br /><i>main engine start.</i>

2558556 2561036 Prepare for<br />stage one separation.
2561602 2562777 Stage one.
2568478 2570176 There is Mach 1.
2571394 2572700 Everybody good?
2572744 2574920 Plenty of slaves<br />for my robot colony?
2576922 2578576 They gave him a humor setting,
2578619 2580665 so he'd fit in better<br />with his unit.
2580708 2582405 He thinks it relaxes us.
2582449 2585017 A giant sarcastic robot.
2586366 2587715 What a great idea!
2587759 2588803 TARS: I have a cue light<br />I can use
2588847 2590370 when I'm joking<br />if you like.
2590413 2591893 That'd probably help.
2591937 2593634 Yeah, you can use it to find<br />your way back into the ship
2593678 2595157 after I blow you<br />out the airlock.
2596724 2598247 What's your<br />humor setting, TARS?
2598291 2599727 That's 100%.
2599771 2602208 Let's bring it on down<br />to 75, please.
2602251 2604123 TARS: Stage two separation.
2614655 2617092 COOPER:<br />All feeds going manual.
2617136 2618354 DOYLE: Going manual.
2620879 2623272 Deactivate probe heater<br />one, two and three.

2639288 2642944 Pull thrusters back.<br />Fuel cells one,<br />two, three.
2642988 2644467 DOYLE: 100%.
2644511 2646078 COOPER: Ex-mites.
2655435 2657437 It's hard leaving<br />everything.
2657480 2660788 My kids. Your father.
2660832 2663138 We're going to be spending<br />a lot of time together.
2663182 2664792 We should learn to talk.
2665227 2666794 And when not to.
2668317 2670145 Just being honest.
2670189 2672844 I don't think<br />you need to be that honest.
2672887 2675324 Hey, TARS, what's<br />your honesty parameter?
2675368 2677065 90%.
2677109 2678501 90%?
2678545 2680982 Absolute honesty isn't<br />always the most diplomatic,
2681026 2684333 nor the safest form<br />of communication<br />with emotional beings.
2684377 2685857 Okay.
2685900 2688381 90% it is, Dr. Brand.
2692602 2694343 We are coming up<br />on the <i>Endurance.</i>
2694387 2695736 Twelve minutes out.
2712753 2714494 Okay. Taking control.

2734427 2735776 It's all you, Doyle.
2753838 2756449 Nice and easy, Doyle.<br />Nice and easy.
2761236 2762760 I'm feeling good.

2776469 2777557 Good job.
2810677 2812418 Door's not charging.
2812766 2814202 Never mind.
2837051 2839140 Cooper,<br />you should have control.

2850978 2853024 [WHISPERS] Oh, wow.

2865906 2867168 [BRAND SIGHS]
2867212 2868517 COOPER: <i>Are we ready to spin?</i>
2868561 2869867 BRAND: Just a sec.

2882401 2883445 Hello, TARS.
2884098 2885926 All right, we're all set.
2886884 2888233 Let's do it.

2936585 2938065 Yeah. Mmm.You all right?
2938109 2939806 Yeah,<br />I just need a minute.
2939849 2942504 BRAND: Okay, I think<br />we have some Dramamine<br />in the hab pod.
2942548 2943897 I'm just gonna go get that.
2943941 2944942 Might be in<br />the cryo-beds.<br />I'll just be a sec.
2944985 2946204 Hey, Brand?

3047392 3049524 We have each other.<br />Dr. Mann had it worse.
3049568 3050699 No, I mean them.
3051309 3052179 Hmm?
3052223 3053572 COOPER: It's a perfect planet,
3053615 3056096 and we're not gonna<br />find another one like her.
3056140 3059404 No, it's not like<br />looking for a new condo.
3060709 3062494 The human race<br />is going to be
3062929 3064496 adrift,
3064539 3066280 desperate for a rock<br />it can cling to
3066324 3067673 while it catches<br />its breath.
3068587 3070763 We need to find that rock.
3070806 3073592 And our three prospects<br />are at the edge of what
3073635 3075898 might sustain human life.
3075942 3078292 Laura Miller's planet<br />is first.
3078336 3079902 Laura started<br />our biology program.
3079946 3081121 COOPER: Mmm-hmm.
3085778 3087562 BRAND: Uh,<br />Wolf Edmunds is here.
3087606 3088607 Tell me about Edmunds.
3089608 3092263 Oh, uh...<br />Wolf's a particle physicist.
3094874 3096789 None of them<br />had families, huh?
3098007 3101141 No. No attachments.<br />My father insisted.
3101185 3103012 They all knew<br />the odds against
3103056 3105058 ever seeing<br />another human being again.
3105102 3106842 I'm hoping we can surprise<br />at least three of them.
3106886 3109149 How about Mann?Dr. Mann?
3109193 3111151 Well, he's remarkable.<br />He's the best of us.
3111195 3113545 He inspired 11 people<br />to follow him
3113588 3115677 on the loneliest journey<br />in human history.
3115721 3117244 Scientists, explorers.
3117288 3119290 That's what I love.
3119333 3121466 You know, out there<br />we face great odds.
3121901 3123207 Death, but...
3125034 3126862 Not evil.
3126906 3128995 You don't think<br />nature can be evil?
3129038 3131389 No. Formidable.<br />Frightening. But...
3132216 3133652 No, not evil.
3135349 3139397 Well, is a lion evil because<br />it rips a gazelle to shreds?
3139440 3141225 Just what we take<br />with us, is that it?
3141790 3143618 Yeah.
3143662 3145533 This crew represents<br />the best of humanity.
3145577 3147144 Even me, huh?
3147187 3149102 You know what?<br />We agreed, 90%.
3149146 3150321 There you go.
3150712 3151800 Don't stay up.
3151844 3153193 I'll be there in a minute.
3153237 3155195 Just remember, Coop,
3155239 3157154 you are literally<br />wasting your breath.
3163943 3165118 COOPER: Hey, TARS?
3165162 3167381 Let's go over that trajectory<br />one more time.
3167425 3169601 TARS: Eight months to Mars.
3169644 3171472 Counter-orbital<br />slingshot around.
3171516 3174083 Fourteen months to Saturn.<br />Nothing's changed on that.
3174127 3175955 Just let me<br />ask you something.
3178305 3179611 [WHISPERING]<br />Dr. Brand and Edmunds...
3179654 3181700 TARS: Why are you whispering?<br />They can't hear you.
3183310 3184833 [NORMAL VOICE]<br />Dr. Brand and Edmunds.
3184877 3186226 They close?
3186270 3187880 I wouldn't know.
3187923 3191057 Is that 90% "wouldn't know"<br />or 10% "wouldn't know"?
3191100 3192798 I also have<br />a discretion setting, Cooper.
3192841 3193886 Oh.
3195801 3197585 But not a poker face, Slick.
3210250 3211512 Hey, guys.
3212426 3215299 Dad's about to go down<br />for the long nap.
3215342 3217997 <i>So I wanted to </i><br /><i>give you an update.</i>
3218040 3219999 <i>Uh...</i>
3220042 3222349 <i>The Earth looks </i><br /><i>amazing from here.</i>
3222741 3224046 <i>Um...</i>
3224090 3225831 <i>You can't see </i><br /><i>any of the dust.</i>
3225874 3226962 [CHUCKLES]
3228399 3231489 <i>I really hope </i><br /><i>you guys are doing great.</i>
3231532 3233012 <i>I know you're gonna </i><br /><i>get this message.</i>
3233055 3236233 <i>Professor Brand's assured me </i><br /><i>that he's gonna get it to you.</i>
3236276 3237930 <i>Know that I love you.</i>
3239758 3241063 Is it him?
3241107 3242282 DONALD:<br />I don't think so, Murph.
3249246 3250725 You must be Donald.
3252858 3253859 Hello, Murph.
3255121 3257384 Why are you<br />in my dad's truck?
3257428 3259343 He wanted me<br />to bring it for your brother.
3260344 3262433 He sent you a message.
3265610 3267568 She's pretty upset<br />with him for leaving.
3267612 3269396 If you record any messages,
3269440 3271572 I can get them<br />to transmit it to Cooper.
3272921 3275402 Murph is a bright spark.
3276490 3279406 Maybe I should fan the flame.
3279450 3282279 She's already making fools<br />of her teachers.
3282322 3284672 So maybe she should come<br />and make a fool out of you.
3285804 3287675 So where are they?
3287719 3289460 Heading for Mars.
3289503 3291418 The next time<br />you hear from Cooper,
3291462 3293638 they'll be coming up<br />on Saturn.
3333504 3334896 YOUNG TOM: <i>...school goes,</i>
3334940 3337203 <i>the administration wants me </i><br /><i>to repeat plant pathology.</i>
3337246 3338422 <i>Which sucks.</i>
3339118 3340467 <i>But they said I could start</i>
3340511 3342469 <i>advanced agriculture</i><br /><i>a year early.</i>
3344384 3347735 <i>All right, I got to go, Dad. </i><br /><i>Hope you're safe up there.</i>
3352044 3353654 DONALD: <i>I'm sorry, Coop.</i>
3353698 3355830 <i>I asked Murph to say hi,</i>
3355874 3359007 <i>but she's as stubborn</i><br /><i>as her old man.</i>
3359051 3360618 <i>I'll try again next time.</i>
3376068 3377374 COOPER: You all right, Rom?
3380028 3381639 This gets to me, Cooper.
3381682 3383945 This. This.
3383989 3387079 Millimeters of aluminum,<br />that's it, and then nothing
3387122 3388994 out there<br />for millions of miles
3389037 3390735 won't kill us in seconds.
3392127 3394042 You know that<br />some of the finest
3394086 3398090 solo yachtsmen in the world<br />don't know how to swim?
3398133 3399439 They don't know how.
3399483 3401180 And if they go overboard,<br />they're done.
3403443 3405097 We're explorers, Rom.
3407055 3408535 This is our boat.
3408883 3409884 Here.

3421287 3423071 [THUNDER RUMBLING]
3437303 3439261 COOPER: This is<br />from the relay probe?
3439305 3441438 It was in orbit<br />around the wormhole.
3441481 3442569 This is the wormhole,
3442613 3444136 and every time<br />we'd come around,
3444745 3446443 we would receive images
3446486 3448270 from the other side<br />of the foreign galaxy.
3448314 3450621 Oh, yeah. Like swinging<br />a periscope around.
3450664 3452057 Exactly.
3452100 3453711 So we got a pretty good idea
3453754 3456104 what we're gonna find<br />on the other side, huh?
3457410 3458629 Navigationally.
3460544 3461936 BRAND ON INTERCOM:<br /><i>Guys? Looks like we'll be</i>
3461980 3463808 <i>approaching the wormhole</i><br /><i>in about three hours.</i>
3470336 3471468 Hey, Coop?
3472338 3474166 Can we stop the spinning?
3474209 3475602 Why?Um...
3475646 3477648 Because we're close enough<br />to see it now?
3479214 3480215 All right.
3480999 3482000 [WHISPERS] Thanks.
3487658 3490225 There, that's it!<br />That's the wormhole!
3490269 3491662 Say it,<br />don't spray it, Rom.
3492097 3493794 It's a sphere.
3493838 3497232 Of course it is. You thought<br />it would just be a hole?
3498582 3500627 No, it's just that<br />all the illustrations
3500671 3502194 I've ever seen, they...
3502237 3503587 ROMILLY: The illustrations
3503630 3505980 are trying to show you<br />how it works.
3506024 3510202 So they say you want to<br />go from here to there.
3510245 3511812 But it's too far, right?
3511856 3512900 Mmm-hmm.
3512944 3515381 So a wormhole<br />bends space like this,
3515424 3517557 so you can take<br />a shortcut through
3517601 3519211 a higher dimension.
3519559 3521518 Okay, so,
3521561 3522910 to show that,<br />they've turned
3522954 3525739 three-dimensional space<br />into two dimensions,
3525783 3529613 which turns a wormhole into<br />two dimensions... A circle.
3529656 3531702 What's a circle<br />in three dimensions?
3533268 3535053 A sphere.Exactly.
3535096 3537185 A spherical hole.
3537229 3539797 But who put it there?<br />Who do we have to thank?
3540449 3542495 I'm not thanking anybody
3542539 3544889 until we get out of here<br />in one piece, Rom.
3552157 3553550 Any trick to this, Doyle?
3555334 3556727 No one knows.
3562210 3563211 [SIGHING]
3564169 3565562 The others made it, right?
3567607 3569087 At least some of them.
3583623 3584885 COOPER: Oh...
3601293 3604601 Everybody ready to say<br />good-bye to our solar system?
3605384 3607212 To our galaxy.
3609170 3610171 Here we go.

3642769 3644553 Your controls won't work here.
3644597 3646643 We're passing<br />through the bulk.
3646686 3648775 It's space beyond<br />our three dimensions.
3648819 3650995 All you can do<br />is record and observe.
3659656 3660961 [BREATH TREMBLING]
3662267 3663311 What is that?
3665749 3667620 I think it's them.
3667664 3669666 Distorting spacetime.
3671624 3672973 Don't! Don't!

3700566 3701785 What was that?
3704875 3706267 The first handshake.
3708052 3709053 We're...
3710707 3711882 We're here.
3732250 3734687 So the lost communications<br />came through.
3734731 3735949 BRAND: How?
3735993 3738038 The relay on this side<br />cached them.
3738082 3742216 So years of basic data.<br />No real surprises.
3742260 3746090 Miller's site has kept<br />pinging thumbs up,<br />as has Dr. Mann's.
3746133 3748179 Edmunds' went down<br />three years ago.
3748788 3750181 Transmitter failure?
3750224 3751878 Maybe. He was sending<br />the thumbs up
3751922 3753271 right until it went dark.
3753314 3755577 But Miller's still looks good,<br />though, right?
3755621 3756622 Because she's<br />coming up fast.
3756665 3757841 Mmm-hmm.
3757884 3760234 With one complication.
3760278 3763498 The planet is much closer to<br />Gargantua than we thought.
3763542 3764848 COOPER: Gargantua?
3764891 3766414 It's what we're calling<br />the black hole.
3766458 3768634 Miller's and Dr. Mann's<br />planets both orbit it.
3768677 3770767 And Miller's<br />is on the horizon?
3770810 3772246 ROMILLY: As a basketball<br />around a hoop.
3772290 3774161 Landing there takes us<br />dangerously close.
3774205 3777774 And a black hole that big<br />has a huge gravitational pull.
3780341 3781778 Look, I could swing around
3781821 3782996 that neutron star<br />to decelerate.
3783040 3785433 No, no, no, it's not that.<br />It's time.
3785477 3787479 The gravity on that planet<br />will slow our clock
3787522 3789786 compared to Earth's<br />drastically.
3790569 3791788 How bad?
3791831 3794965 Every hour we spend<br />on that planet will be
3796444 3798316 seven years back on Earth.
3799491 3800840 [WHISPERS] Jesus!
3800884 3802494 Well, that's relativity,<br />folks.
3804017 3806541 Well, we can't just<br />drop down there without...
3806585 3808630 Cooper, we have a mission.
3808674 3809806 Yeah, Doyle,<br />we have a mission,
3809849 3811416 and our mission Plan A is
3811459 3813244 to find a planet that<br />can habitate the people
3813287 3814854 that are living<br />on the Earth right now.
3814898 3816290 You can't just think<br />about your family.
3816334 3817726 Now, you have to think<br />bigger than that, all right?
3817770 3819119 I am thinking about my family
3819163 3820991 and millions of<br />other families, okay?
3821034 3823167 Plan A does not work<br />if the people on Earth
3823210 3825169 are dead by the time<br />we pull it off.
3826431 3828650 No. It doesn't.
3828694 3830304 That's why there's a Plan B.
3831915 3833873 Okay. Cooper's right.
3833917 3835483 We need to think about time<br />as a resource,
3835527 3836745 just like oxygen and food.
3836789 3837964 Going down there<br />is gonna cost us.
3839879 3841054 All right, look.
3842708 3844753 Dr. Mann's data<br />is promising, right,
3844797 3846320 but it's going to take us<br />months to get there.
3846364 3848540 And Edmunds',<br />it's even further.
3848583 3849758 Now Miller hasn't sent much,
3849802 3851151 but what she has sent<br />is very promising.
3851195 3852761 It's water,<br />it's organics...
3852805 3854198 You don't find that every day.
3854241 3855590 No, you don't.
3855634 3857897 And just think<br />about the resources,<br />including time,
3857941 3860030 that would be spent<br />trying to get back here.
3861509 3862902 Romilly?Yeah.
3862946 3865122 How far off from Miller's<br />planet do we have to be
3865165 3867385 to stay out of<br />the time shift?
3867428 3868865 Just back from the cusp.
3868908 3870257 Which is here,
3870301 3872085 just outside of<br />Miller's planet.
3872129 3873870 ROMILLY: Right.Okay.
3874740 3877874 Here's Gargantua.<br />Here's Miller's planet.
3877917 3879527 Instead of taking<br />the <i>Endurance</i>
3879571 3880833 into orbit<br />around Miller's planet,
3880877 3882139 which would conserve fuel,
3882182 3884054 but we would lose<br />a lot of time,
3884097 3887013 what if we take a wider orbit<br />around Gargantua,
3887057 3888319 parallel with<br />Miller's planet,
3888362 3890887 outside of this time shift,<br />to here?
3890930 3892192 Then we take the Ranger down,
3892236 3893977 we get Miller,<br />we get her samples.
3894020 3895848 We come back,<br />we analyze, we debrief.
3895892 3897154 We're in, we're out.
3897197 3899156 We lose a little fuel,<br />but we save a lot of time.
3899199 3901158 That'll work.That's good.
3901201 3902550 There's not gonna be time<br />for monkey business
3902594 3903943 or chit-chat down there.
3903987 3906946 So, TARS, you should<br />definitely stay here.
3906990 3909383 CASE, you're with me.<br />Anyone else can stay.
3909427 3912038 If we're talking<br />about a couple years,
3912082 3913692 I could use the time<br />to research gravity.
3913735 3914780 Observations from<br />the wormhole,
3914823 3916216 that's gold<br />to Professor Brand.
3916260 3918131 TARS, factor an orbit<br />of Gargantua.
3918175 3920394 Conserve fuel,<br />minimize thrusting,
3920438 3922919 but make sure we stay<br />in range of Miller's planet.
3922962 3923963 You got it?
3924007 3925530 TARS: I wouldn't<br />leave you behind,
3926226 3927227 Dr. Brand.
3931797 3933233 COOPER: You ready, CASE?Yup.
3934191 3935932 You don't say much, do you?
3935975 3937759 TARS talks plenty<br />for both of us.
3937803 3938935 [BEEPING]
3938978 3940110 Detach.
3947378 3949075 [RATTLING]Romilly, are you reading<br />these forces?

3953645 3955429 A literal heart of darkness.
3959651 3962828 If we could just see<br />the collapsed star inside
3962871 3965962 the singularity,<br />yeah, we'd solve gravity.
3966005 3967441 And we can't<br />get anything from it?
3967485 3969008 ROMILLY: <i>Nothing </i><br /><i>escapes that horizon.</i>
3969052 3970531 Not even light.
3970575 3973099 <i>Oh, the answer's there, </i><br /><i>just no way to see it.</i>
3973143 3974361 There's Miller's planet.
3977060 3978322 Good-bye, Ranger.
3991378 3993337 CASE: This is fast<br />for atmospheric entry.
3993380 3995382 Should we use<br />the thrusters to slow?
3995426 3996601 No.
3996644 3998472 No, I'm gonna use<br />the Ranger's aerodynamics
3998516 3999821 to save some fuel.

4001040 4002476 We want to get down fast,<br />don't we?

4409927 4411494 God damn it!
4411537 4413887 I told you to leave me!And I told you...
4413931 4416281 Why didn't you leave me?...to get your ass back here!
4416324 4417543 The difference is one of us
4417587 4418631 was thinking<br />about the mission, Brand!
4418675 4420764 You were thinking about<br />getting home.
4422809 4425290 I was trying to do<br />the right thing!
4425333 4426944 Can you tell that to Doyle?
4427292 4429250 [GASPING]
4429294 4430382 COOPER: CASE, how much time?
4430426 4431862 45 to an hour.
4431905 4433516 [GASPS]
4433559 4434865 COOPER:<br />The stuff of life, huh?
4435822 4437433 What's this gonna<br />cost us, Brand?

4444396 4445658 [GROANS]
4447573 4448792 What happened to Miller?
4449488 4451751 Judging by the wreckage,
4451795 4454232 she was broken up by a wave<br />soon after impact.
4455320 4456582 How's the wreckage<br />stayed together
4456626 4458018 after all these years, huh?
4459280 4460978 Because of the time slippage.
4461979 4466592 On this planet's time,<br />she just landed hours ago.
4467767 4469987 She probably just died<br />minutes ago.
4470030 4472598 CASE: The data Doyle received<br />was just the initial status,
4472642 4474600 echoing endlessly.
4474644 4476167 Oh, we are not<br />prepared for this.
4478996 4482869 You eggheads have the survival<br />skills of a Boy Scout troop.
4482913 4484610 Well, we got this far<br />on our brains,
4484654 4486351 farther than any human<br />in history.
4486394 4488266 Well, not far enough!
4488309 4489746 And now we're stuck here
4489789 4491661 till there won't be anyone<br />left on Earth to save.
4494881 4497536 I'm counting every minute,<br />same as you, Cooper.
4502280 4503716 Is there any possibility...
4504195 4505718 I don't know...
4505762 4507981 Some kind of way we can maybe<br />all jump in a black hole?
4508025 4509113 Gain back the years?
4509156 4510549 [SCOFFS]
4510593 4512246 Don't shake your head at me.
4512290 4514292 Time is relative, okay?
4514335 4516903 It can stretch<br />and it can squeeze, but
4517861 4519993 it can't run backwards.<br />It just can't.
4520037 4523344 The only thing that can move<br />across dimensions, like time,
4523388 4524520 is gravity.
4527261 4528306 Okay.
4530177 4534355 The beings that led us here,<br />they communicate
4534399 4536532 through gravity, right?[WHISPERS] Yes.
4536575 4538621 Could they be talking to us<br />from the future?
4539099 4540361 Maybe.
4540405 4541580 Okay. If they can...
4542799 4546542 "They" are beings<br />of five dimensions.
4546585 4550328 To them, time might be<br />another physical dimension.
4550371 4551547 To them,
4551590 4553549 the past might be a canyon
4553592 4556203 that they can climb into<br />and the future,
4556247 4560381 a mountain they can climb up.<br />But to us, it's not, okay?
4560425 4563254 Look, Cooper, I screwed up.<br />I'm sorry.
4565169 4567301 But you knew about relativity.
4567345 4568346 Oh...

4571915 4573090 [INHALES DEEPLY]
4575788 4578574 My daughter was 10 years old.
4578617 4579618 I couldn't teach her<br />Einstein's theories
4579662 4581838 before I left.
4581881 4584144 Couldn't you have told her you<br />were going to save the world?
4585276 4586277 No.
4587757 4589802 When you become a parent,
4589846 4591848 one thing becomes<br />really clear.
4593545 4594633 And that is that<br />you want to make sure
4594677 4596374 your children feel safe.
4597723 4599638 And it rules out<br />telling a 10-year-old
4599682 4601640 that the world is ending.

4703829 4706571 Oh, I had<br />a couple of stretches.
4706614 4708225 But I stopped believing<br />you were coming back.
4708268 4711837 And something seemed wrong<br />about dreaming my life away.
4711881 4715580 I learned what I could<br />from the black hole,

4914083 4915954 <i>You son of a bitch.</i>
4920089 4922787 <i>I never made one of these </i><br /><i>when you were still responding</i>
4922830 4924571 <i>because I was so mad at you</i><br /><i>for leaving.</i>

4949466 4950554 [SIGHS]
4953426 4955733 <i>You once told me that</i><br /><i>when you came back,</i>
4955776 4957430 <i>we might be the same age.</i>

4962479 4963610 [SOBBING]
4965308 4968267 <i>So it would be a real good</i><br /><i>time for you to come back.</i>

4976319 4977407 [SNIFFLES]
4982020 4984109 I didn't mean to intrude.
4984153 4986982 It's just that I've never<br />seen you in here before.
4987025 4988984 I've never been<br />in here before.
4991160 4993684 PROFESSOR BRAND:<br />I talk to Amelia all the time.
4994467 4995555 It helps.
4996513 4997775 I'm glad you've started.
4997818 4998950 MURPH: I haven't.
4998994 5002127 I just had something<br />I needed to get out.
5002171 5003520 PROFESSOR BRAND: I know<br />they're still out there.
5003563 5005043 MURPH: I know.
5005087 5007654 There are so many reasons<br />their communications
5007698 5009352 might not be<br />getting through.
5009395 5011267 I know, Professor.
5011310 5014661 I'm not sure<br />what I'm more afraid of.
5015271 5017447 Them never coming back,
5019014 5022017 or coming back<br />to find we've failed.
5022060 5023409 Then let's succeed.
5024715 5026195 So...
5026238 5028371 Back to the fourth iteration.
5028414 5030677 Let's run it through<br />some new fields.
5030721 5032070 With respect, Professor,
5032114 5034159 we've tried that<br />hundreds of times.
5034203 5038076 It only has to<br />work once, Murph.
5041166 5045083 Every rivet that<br />they strike could<br />have been a bullet.
5045127 5047216 We've done well<br />for the world here,
5047259 5049740 whether or not<br />we crack the equation
5049783 5052351 before I kick the bucket.
5052395 5053831 Don't be morbid, Professor.
5053874 5055354 I'm not afraid of death.
5055920 5057487 I'm an old physicist.
5059141 5061230 I'm afraid of time.
5068106 5069238 MURPH: Time.
5071240 5072763 You're afraid of time.
5075592 5077376 For years, we've been<br />trying to solve the equation
5077420 5078812 without changing<br />the underlying assumption
5078856 5080510 about time.
5080553 5082077 And?And that means
5082120 5085732 each iteration is an attempt<br />to prove its own proof.
5086603 5089214 It's recursive.<br />It's nonsensical.
5089258 5091216 Are you calling<br />my life's work
5091260 5093262 nonsense, Murph?
5093305 5095133 No, I'm saying<br />you've been trying to
5095177 5096352 finish it with one arm...
5096395 5098832 No, with both arms<br />tied behind your back.
5101139 5102880 And I don't understand why.
5104186 5105839 I'm an old man, Murph.
5107014 5109713 Can we take this point up<br />at another time?
5109756 5111497 I want to talk<br />to my daughter.
5114065 5116459 PROFESSOR BRAND: <i>Stepping out </i><br /><i>into the universe,</i>

5141658 5144748 But the trip took years longer<br />than we anticipated.
5144791 5147838 We no longer have the fuel<br />to visit both prospects, so...

5162418 5163854 Edmunds' data<br />would have soured.
5165334 5167771 His world has key elements<br />to sustain human life.
5167814 5169207 As does Dr. Mann's.
5169251 5170730 Cooper, this is my field.
5172428 5174212 And...
5174256 5176040 I really believe Edmunds'<br />is the better prospect.
5176083 5177607 Why?
5177650 5179435 Gargantua, that's why.
5180697 5184962 Look at Miller's planet.<br />Hydrocarbons, organics, yes.
5185005 5188183 But no life. Sterile.
5188226 5189836 We'll find the same thing<br />on Mann's.
5189880 5191795 Because of the black hole?
5191838 5192970 BRAND: Murphy's Law.
5193013 5194841 Whatever can happen<br />will happen.
5194885 5197540 Accident is the first<br />building block of evolution.
5197583 5198889 But when you're orbiting<br />a black hole,
5198932 5200499 not enough can happen.
5200543 5203154 It sucks in asteroids<br />and comets,
5203198 5205200 other events which would<br />otherwise reach you.
5205243 5206766 We need to<br />go further afield.
5207593 5209726 You once said that Dr. Mann
5211206 5212946 was the best of us.
5212990 5214600 He's remarkable.
5214644 5216254 We're only here<br />because of him.
5216776 5218735 And yet here he is.
5218778 5220345 He's on the ground,
5220389 5222956 and he's sending a very<br />unambiguous message,
5223000 5225655 telling us to<br />come to his planet.
5225698 5230312 Granted, but Edmunds' data<br />is more promising.
5230834 5231922 We should vote.
5231965 5233184 Well, if we're going to vote,
5233228 5234490 there's something<br />you should know.
5235447 5236927 Brand?
5236970 5238885 He has a right to know.
5238929 5240539 That has nothing<br />to do with it.
5240583 5241932 What does?
5241975 5243803 She's in love<br />with Wolf Edmunds.
5243847 5244935 ROMILLY: Is that true?
5245414 5246458 Yes.
5249635 5251942 And that makes me<br />want to follow my heart.
5255424 5257382 But maybe we've spent too long
5257426 5259297 trying to figure all this out<br />with theory.
5259341 5260951 You're a scientist, Brand.
5260994 5262300 So listen to me
5263519 5266957 when I say that love isn't<br />something we invented.
5267000 5269002 It's [SIGHS]
5269046 5271048 observable, powerful.
5273790 5275357 It has to mean something.
5275400 5277924 Love has meaning, yes.<br />Social utility,
5277968 5279578 social bonding,<br />child rearing...
5279622 5281711 We love people who have died.
5281754 5283626 Where's the social utility<br />in that?
5284627 5285976 None.
5286019 5289066 Maybe it means something more,<br />something we can't
5289109 5291460 yet understand.
5291503 5294811 Maybe it's some evidence,<br />some...
5296073 5298293 ...artifact<br />of a higher dimension
5298336 5300512 that we can't<br />consciously perceive.
5300556 5303036 I'm drawn across the universe
5303080 5305343 to someone I haven't seen<br />in a decade,
5305387 5308651 who I know is probably dead.
5308694 5312263 Love is the one thing<br />we're capable of perceiving
5312307 5314657 that transcends dimensions<br />of time and space.
5317007 5318400 Maybe we should trust that,
5318443 5320880 even if we can't<br />understand it yet.
5326146 5327496 All right, Cooper...
5329846 5330890 Yes,
5332239 5335504 the tiniest possibility of<br />seeing Wolf again excites me.
5336374 5337897 That doesn't mean<br />I'm wrong.
5338985 5340509 Honestly, Amelia,
5342902 5343903 it might.
5347646 5348647 [SOBS]
5350693 5353609 TARS, chart a course<br />for Dr. Mann's.
5370539 5373368 We'll lose about a third<br />again. But next year...
5373411 5374586 [CLICKS TONGUE]
5375674 5377459 Next year I'm gonna work<br />Nelson's farm
5377502 5378721 and I'll make it up.
5379417 5380897 What happened to Nelson?
5387251 5388426 LOIS: <i>Murph,</i><br /><i>have you eaten enough?</i>
5388470 5389645 <i>Would you like</i><br /><i>some more souffle?</i>
5389688 5392561 No, no. I'm full, thanks.<br />It was delicious.
5393736 5395564 Coop, finish your fritter,<br />please.
5398001 5399698 Will you spend the night?
5399742 5402005 Your room is exactly<br />as you left it. It's ready.
5402048 5403441 I need to get back.<br />[SNIFFLES]
5403485 5404529 LOIS: My sewing machine<br />is in there,
5404573 5405922 but there's plenty of...
5405965 5407010 I need to...
5410100 5411406 Too many memories.
5411449 5412450 TOM: Well...
5412494 5414060 We might have<br />something for that.
5414409 5415584 Hey, Coop.
5420153 5421938 [COOP COUGHING]
5422939 5423940 The dust.
5426682 5428466 Lois, I have a friend who...
5428510 5429554 [COOP COUGHING]
5429598 5431121 ...could look at his lungs.
5449618 5451054 COOPER: Amelia, I'm sorry.
5451097 5452359 You were just<br />being objective.
5452403 5453796 Unless you're punishing me
5453839 5455624 for screwing up<br />on Miller's planet.
5455667 5458061 No, this wasn't<br />a personal decision.
5459062 5460411 If you're wrong,
5460455 5462848 you will have a very personal<br />decision to make.
5462892 5466591 Your fuel calculations are<br />based on a return journey.
5466635 5468332 Strike out on Mann's planet,
5468375 5470465 and we'll have to decide<br />whether to return home
5470508 5472945 or push on to Edmunds'<br />with Plan B.
5472989 5477341 Starting a colony<br />could save us<br />from extinction.
5477384 5478951 You might have to<br />decide between
5478995 5480605 seeing your children again
5480649 5482172 and the future<br />of the human race.
5483652 5485218 I trust you'll be<br />as objective then.
5492095 5494532 He's been asking for you<br />since he came to.
5494576 5495881 We were trying<br />to reach you.
5499015 5500016 MURPH: [WHISPERS]<br />Hey.
5501974 5503019 Murph.
5503062 5505804 Hi. I'm here, Professor.
5505848 5508633 [WEAKLY] I let them all down.
5508677 5511767 No, you got us so far!<br />Real close.
5513812 5515640 I'll finish what you started.
5515684 5517903 Good, good, Murph.
5520602 5522212 You had faith
5523866 5525084 all those...
5526259 5527826 All those years.
5529698 5531047 I...
5531090 5533702 I asked you to have faith.
5535268 5537706 I wanted you to believe
5539490 5541100 that your father...
5544408 5545888 ...would come back.
5546628 5548107 I do, Professor.
5549326 5550719 Forgive me, Murph.
5551502 5553243 There's nothing to forgive.
5556289 5557290 I...
5557900 5559815 I lied, Murph.
5562165 5563732 I lied to you.
5570173 5573132 There was no need for him
5574612 5576135 to come back.
5579312 5582315 There is no...<br />No way to help us.
5583621 5585231 But Plan A...
5585275 5588626 All this.<br />All these people.
5589409 5591194 And the equation.
5595633 5597113 Did my father know?
5600986 5602727 Did he leave me?
5606775 5607776 Do
5609125 5610126 not
5611301 5612302 go
5613912 5615131 gentle...
5617394 5618395 No.
5620136 5621137 No!
5622399 5623966 You can't leave.
5624401 5625707 You... No.
5626708 5628057 MURPH: <i>Dr. Brand,</i><br /><i>I'm sorry to tell</i>
5628100 5631669 <i>that your father died today. </i><br /><i>He had no pain.</i>
5632104 5633976 He was at peace.
5634019 5636674 I'm very sorry for your loss.<br />[SNIFFLES]
5649165 5650645 Brand, did you know?
5653299 5654736 <i>He told you, right?</i>
5655258 5656346 [BITTER LAUGH]
5657739 5658957 <i>You knew.</i>
5661264 5662700 <i>This was all a sham.</i>
5667357 5669402 <i>You left us here.</i>
5671100 5672318 <i>To suffocate.</i>
5674625 5675887 <i>To starve.</i>
5700346 5701739 [BEEPING]
5703480 5704699 COOPER: Frozen cloud.

5840922 5842532 [BREATHING HEAVILY]
5845361 5847189 [SOBBING]
5849191 5850627 It's okay.
5850670 5852107 It's okay.
5858809 5860202 It's okay.
5865903 5867557 Pray you never learn
5868993 5872127 just how good it can be<br />to see another face.
5880918 5883616 I hadn't a lot of hope<br />to begin with, but...
5883660 5885531 After so long, I had none.
5887185 5890101 My supplies were<br />completely exhausted.
5892190 5893888 The last time I went to sleep,
5893931 5895890 I didn't even set<br />a waking date.
5899894 5902287 You have literally<br />raised me from the dead.
5903419 5905377 Lazarus.Hmm.
5906726 5908424 What about the others?
5908467 5909686 I'm afraid you're it, sir.
5910600 5913429 So far, surely.
5913472 5916911 No, our present situation<br />is that there's very little
5916954 5918695 chance of rescuing any others.
5922177 5924570 BRAND: Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?
5925484 5926921 Tell us about your world.
5928226 5929227 [SNIFFLES]
5930446 5932056 Our world, we hope.
5936104 5938628 Our world, uh, is cold,
5938671 5939716 stark,
5941805 5943328 but undeniably beautiful.
5945896 5949073 <i>The days are 67 hours long,</i><br /><i>cold.</i>
5953382 5954949 <i>The nights are</i>
5954992 5957125 <i>67 far colder hours.</i>
5963087 5967526 <i>The gravity is a very, very </i><br /><i>pleasant 80% of the Earth's.</i>
5967570 5971226 Now, up here where I landed,<br />the water is alkali,
5971269 5973228 and the air has too much<br />ammonia in it to breathe
5973271 5974838 for more than<br />just a few minutes,
5974881 5976709 but down at the surface...
5976753 5979625 And there is a surface.
5979669 5981279 ...the chlorine dissipates.
5981323 5983890 The ammonia gives way<br />to crystalline hydrocarbons
5983934 5985153 and breathable air.
5985631 5987546 To organics.
5987590 5989461 Possibly, even to life.
5990854 5993204 We might be<br />sharing this world.
5993248 5995119 These readings<br />are from the surface?
5995163 5998862 Over the years,<br />I've dropped various probes.
5998905 6000168 COOPER: How far<br />have you explored?
6000211 6002344 I've mounted<br />several major expeditions.
6002387 6004041 But with oxygen<br />in limited supply,
6004085 6006478 KIPP there really did<br />most of the legwork.
6006522 6008045 TARS: What went wrong<br />with him, sir?
6008089 6009481 DR. MANN: Degeneration.
6009525 6011527 He misidentified<br />the first organics we found
6011570 6013137 as ammonia crystals.
6013181 6014704 He struggled on for a time,
6014747 6017446 but ultimately<br />I decommissioned him
6017489 6020144 and used his power source<br />to keep the mission going.
6020188 6022842 I thought I was alone<br />before I shut him down!
6022886 6024366 TARS: Would you like me<br />to look at him?
6025193 6027717 No. No.<br />He needs a human touch.
6027760 6030198 TARS: Dr. Brand, CASE is<br />relaying a message for you
6030241 6032156 from the comm station.
6032200 6034332 Okay. Be right there.<br />Excuse me.
6046823 6048042 <i>Dr. Brand, </i><br /><i>I'm sorry to tell you</i>

6071761 6072849 [BITTER LAUGH]

6077767 6079116 <i>This was all a sham.</i>
6079899 6081379 <i>You left us here.</i>

6102879 6104620 <i>if you left me here to die.</i>
6107188 6109320 <i>I just have to know.</i>
6110104 6111279 [CONTINUES SOBBING]
6115021 6116371 Cooper, my...
6117981 6120114 My father dedicated
6120157 6122116 his whole life to Plan A.
6122159 6125206 I have no idea<br />what she's talking about.
6126816 6127817 DR. MANN: I do.
6133257 6136130 He never even hoped to<br />get the people off the Earth?
6137000 6138132 No.
6142484 6143572 But he's been<br />trying to solve
6143615 6146531 the gravity equation<br />for 40 years.
6146575 6150144 Amelia, your father<br />solved his equation<br />before I even left.
6151014 6152450 Then why wouldn't<br />he use it?
6152494 6154974 The equation couldn't<br />reconcile relativity
6155018 6156889 with quantum mechanics.<br />You need more.
6156933 6159022 More? More what?
6159065 6160154 DR. MANN: More data.
6160197 6161764 You need to see<br />into a black hole.
6161807 6164332 The laws of nature prohibit<br />a naked singularity.
6164375 6165681 Romilly, is that true?
6167161 6168640 If a black hole is an oyster,
6168684 6170816 then the singularity's<br />the pearl inside.
6170860 6173819 The gravity's so strong,<br />it's always hidden<br />in darkness
6173863 6175169 behind the horizon.
6176996 6178998 That's why we call it<br />a black hole.
6179042 6181131 Okay, but<br />[BREATHING HEAVILY]
6181175 6182915 if we see<br />beyond the horizon...
6182959 6184917 We can't, Coop.
6184961 6186005 DR. MANN:<br />There are some things
6186049 6187398 that aren't meant<br />to be known.
6187442 6189270 Your father had to<br />find another way
6189313 6191663 to save the human race<br />from extinction.
6191707 6193230 Plan B. A colony.
6193274 6194710 Why not tell people?
6196538 6198279 Why keep building<br />those damn stations?
6198322 6199715 Because he knew<br />how hard it would be
6199758 6202108 to get people to work together<br />to save the species
6202152 6203545 instead of themselves.
6204110 6205416 Or their children.
6205460 6206722 Bullshit.
6206765 6208332 You never would've come here<br />unless you believed
6208376 6209768 you were gonna save them.
6209812 6212118 Evolution has yet<br />to transcend<br />that simple barrier.
6212162 6214991 We can care deeply,<br />selflessly
6215034 6216384 about those we know,
6216427 6217994 but that empathy<br />rarely extends
6218037 6219213 beyond our line of sight.
6219256 6220779 But the lie.
6224261 6226350 That monstrous lie?
6227743 6229223 Unforgivable.
6229266 6231573 And he knew that.
6231616 6233836 He was prepared to<br />destroy his own humanity
6234619 6236012 in order to save the species.
6236055 6237361 He made<br />an incredible sacrifice.
6237405 6238406 No.
6240103 6242279 No, an incredible sacrifice<br />is being made
6242323 6245195 by the people on Earth<br />who are gonna die!
6245239 6248024 Because in his arrogance
6248067 6249678 he declared<br />their case hopeless.
6250635 6251810 I'm sorry, Cooper,
6252507 6254117 their case is hopeless.
6254160 6256424 No. No.
6256902 6257990 We are the future.
6262125 6263822 Cooper, what can I do?
6267304 6269567 Let me go home.
6269611 6272353 GETTY: You're<br />absolutely positive?
6272396 6274790 His solution was correct.<br />He'd had it for years.
6275225 6276748 It's worthless?
6276792 6278010 It's half the answer.
6279142 6282450 Okay. How do you find<br />the other half?
6282493 6284321 Out there? A black hole.
6284365 6286497 But stuck down here<br />on Earth?
6286541 6287716 Yeah?
6288456 6289979 I'm not sure you can.
6292329 6294636 GETTY: God,<br />they just pack up and leave.
6296333 6298030 What are they<br />hoping to find?
6299205 6300381 Survival.
6307649 6308650 Damn it.
6311827 6312915 Murph.
6312958 6314351 Don't... [SIGHS]
6314395 6316092 Don't people have<br />a right to know?
6316135 6318224 Well, panic won't help.
6318268 6320401 We just have to keep working,<br />same as ever.
6320444 6322446 Yeah. But isn't that exactly
6322490 6323839 what Professor Brand was<br />manipulating us to do?
6323882 6325275 Brand gave up on us.
6325319 6326885 I'm still trying<br />to solve this.
6327843 6328844 So...
6330411 6331890 Do you have an idea?
6332804 6333936 A feeling.
6337418 6339071 <i>I told you about my ghost.</i>
6341465 6343859 <i>My dad thought</i><br /><i>I called it a ghost</i>
6343902 6345513 because I was scared of it.
6349081 6350561 But I was never scared of it.
6352433 6354957 <i>I called it a ghost</i><br /><i>because it felt...</i>
6357525 6359048 It felt like a person.
6362225 6363792 It was trying to<br />tell me something.
6366708 6369363 If there's an answer<br />here on Earth, it's back there
6370059 6371669 somehow, in that room.
6372409 6373932 So I have to find it.
6375194 6376370 [ENGINE STARTING]
6377545 6379068 We're running out of time.
6381549 6383420 CASE: <i>What about auxiliary </i><br /><i>oxygen scrubbers?</i>
6383464 6384682 COOPER: No,<br />they can stay, CASE.
6384726 6385944 I'll be sleeping<br />most of the way, anyway.
6385988 6387685 Hey, Coop.Yeah.
6387729 6389861 I have a suggestion<br />for your return journey.
6389905 6390949 Yeah, what's that?
6390993 6392560 Have one last crack<br />at the black hole.
6394344 6395693 I'm going home, Rom.
6395737 6399088 Yeah, I know.<br />This isn't going to<br />cost you any time.
6400350 6401960 There's a chance<br />for the people on Earth.
6402483 6403571 Talk to me.
6403614 6405790 Gargantua's an older<br />spinning black hole.
6405834 6408576 It's what we call<br />a gentle singularity.
6408880 6409925 Gentle?
6409968 6411405 They're hardly gentle.
6411448 6413537 But the tidal gravity<br />is so quick that
6413581 6416540 something crossing the horizon<br />fast might survive.
6417106 6418150 A probe, say.
6418194 6419543 What happens after it crosses?
6419587 6423068 After the horizon<br />is a complete mystery.
6423112 6426158 So, what's to say there<br />isn't some way that the probe
6426202 6429205 can glimpse the singularity<br />and relay the quantum data?
6429248 6430511 If he's equipped to transmit
6430554 6432730 every form of energy<br />that can pulse.
6432774 6435777 TARS: Just when did this probe<br />become a "he," Professor?
6435820 6438562 TARS is the obvious candidate.
6438606 6440782 I've already told him<br />what to look for.
6440825 6443393 TARS: I need the old optical<br />transmitter off KIPP, Cooper.
6443437 6445047 You'd do this for us?
6445090 6446222 TARS: Before<br />you get all teary,
6446265 6447441 try to remember that<br />as a robot
6447484 6449225 I have to do anything you say.
6450052 6451357 Your cue light's broken.
6451401 6452750 TARS: I'm not joking.
6455710 6457451 I'm gonna need TARS<br />to remove and adapt
6457494 6459191 some components from KIPP.
6459235 6461498 Well, I don't want to disturb<br />his archival functions.
6461542 6462847 ROMILLY: Oh, I'll supervise.
6463500 6464762 All right.
6464806 6467417 Dr. Mann, we need to find<br />three secure sites.
6467461 6469854 One for Brand's lab,<br />two for habitat.
6469898 6472291 Once those modules<br />have landed, you don't<br />want to move 'em.
6472335 6473423 Well, I can take you<br />to the probe sites,
6473467 6474772 but I don't think this...
6474816 6476513 These conditions<br />are gonna hold.
6476557 6477688 I think we should wait.
6477732 6479037 COOPER: CASE is<br />headed back down
6479081 6480604 with the rest<br />of the distillery equipment.
6480648 6483477 I'd really like to secure<br />those sites by nightfall.
6485566 6488699 Well, these squalls<br />do usually blow over.
6489178 6490658 Okay then.
6490701 6492529 But you're gonna need<br />a long-range transmitter.Got it.
6492573 6493878 Are you charged?Yeah.
6494923 6496359 Follow me.
6496402 6498753 TARS, 72 hours, yeah?
6498796 6500494 TARS: Roger that, Cooper.
6506674 6509154 DR. MANN: Brand told me why<br />you feel you have to go back.
6511026 6514203 But I'd be remiss if I didn't<br />at least mention that
6514246 6515596 a mission such as ours
6515639 6518163 could certainly use<br />an extra engineer.
6518990 6520339 [BEEPING]
6520383 6522690 You better slow down, turbo.
6522733 6525344 Safety first, CASE, remember.
6525388 6527042 CASE ON RADIO:<br /><i>Safety first, Cooper.</i>
6528347 6529566 COOPER: I have to<br />tell you, Dr. Mann,
6529610 6531525 I'm honored to be<br />a part of this.
6531568 6533875 But once we set up base camp
6533918 6536225 and secure those modules,<br />my work's done here.
6537269 6538314 I'm going home.
6546409 6548454 You have attachments.
6548498 6550500 But even without<br />a family, I can
6550544 6552371 promise you that,<br />that yearning
6552415 6555549 to be with other<br />people is powerful.
6555592 6559683 That emotion<br />is at the foundation
6559727 6562556 of what makes us human.<br />It's not to be taken lightly.

6619700 6621353 Just take this gently.
6626750 6628404 DR. MANN: You know why we<br />couldn't just send machines
6628447 6630624 on these missions,<br />don't you, Cooper?
6630667 6632626 [PANTING] A machine<br />doesn't improvise well
6632669 6634802 because you can't program<br />a fear of death.

6638588 6641896 source of inspiration.<br />Take you, for example.
6643071 6644768 A father
6644812 6648772 with a survival instinct<br />that extends to your kids.
6648816 6651470 What does research tell us<br />is the last thing
6651514 6653124 you're going to see<br />before you die?
6655300 6657955 Your children. Their faces.
6657999 6660654 At the moment of death,<br />your mind's gonna push
6660697 6662133 a little bit harder<br />to survive.
6663134 6664222 For them.

8812238 8815328 TARS: <i>Cooper. Cooper.</i><br /><i>Come in, Cooper.</i>
8816808 8818157 TARS?
8818200 8819332 <i>Roger that.</i>
8821203 8822509 You survived.
8822552 8823553 <i>Somewhere</i>
8824511 8826556 <i>in their fifth dimension.</i>
8826600 8828123 <i>They saved us.</i>
8828994 8832214 Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?
8832258 8834173 And just why would<br />they want to help us, huh?
8834216 8835957 <i>I don't know,</i><br /><i>but they constructed</i>
8836001 8837219 <i>this three-dimensional space</i>
8837263 8839134 <i>inside their</i><br /><i>five-dimensional reality</i>
8839178 8840701 <i>to allow you to understand it.</i>
8840744 8842311 Well, that ain't working.
8842921 8844487 <i>Yes, it is.</i>
8844531 8846098 <i>You've seen that time</i><br /><i>is represented here</i>
8846141 8848361 <i>as a physical dimension.</i>
8848404 8850102 <i>You have worked out</i><br /><i>that you can exert</i>
8850145 8851886 <i>a force across spacetime.</i>
8851930 8855281 Gravity... To send a message.
8855716 8857022 <i>Affirmative.</i>
8859546 8860547 Gravity
8861940 8865073 can cross the dimensions,<br />including time.
8865726 8867032 <i>Apparently.</i>
8870862 8873038 Do you have the quantum data?
8873081 8874561 <i>Roger. I have it.</i>
8875910 8878043 <i>I am transmitting it</i><br /><i>on all wavelengths,</i>
8878086 8879914 <i>but nothing is getting out, </i><br /><i>Cooper.</i>
8879958 8882699 I can do this. I can do this.
8882743 8885398 <i>But such complicated data </i><br /><i>to a child?</i>
8885441 8886703 Not just any child.
8886747 8888531 What else?
8888575 8890098 Oh, come on, Dad.
8893188 8895190 Murph, the fire's out!<br />Come on!
8895234 8897018 <i>Even if you</i><br /><i>communicate it here,</i>
8897062 8900021 <i>she won't understand </i><br /><i>its significance for years.</i>
8900065 8901936 I get that, TARS. All right?
8901980 8903938 But we've got to<br />figure something out
8903982 8905331 or the people on Earth<br />are gonna die.
8905374 8906549 Think, think, think!
8906593 8908247 <i>Cooper,</i>
8908290 8911032 <i>they didn't bring us here </i><br /><i>to change the past.</i>
8914557 8916124 Say that again.
8916168 8919301 <i>They didn't bring us here </i><br /><i>to change the past.</i>
8923827 8926134 No, they didn't bring us<br />here at all.
8930791 8932358 We brought ourselves.
8941454 8944370 COOPER: TARS, give me<br />the coordinates for NASA
8944413 8946154 in binary.
8946198 8948243 TARS: <i>In binary. Roger.</i><br /><i>Feeding data.</i>
8972789 8974487 "It's not a ghost."
8976489 8978360 "It's gravity."
8978404 8980623 COOPER: [PANTING]<br />Don't you get it yet, TARS?
8980667 8983235 I brought myself here!
8983278 8986673 We're here to communicate with<br />a three-dimensional world.
8987195 8988675 We're the bridge!
8996857 8998337 I thought they chose me.
9002123 9004038 But they didn't choose me,<br />they chose her.
9004082 9006171 TARS: <i>For what, Cooper?</i>[LAUGHS]
9008086 9009565 To save the world.
9014048 9016920 All of this<br />is one little girl's bedroom.
9016964 9018705 Every moment.
9018748 9020359 It's infinitely complex.
9020402 9022839 They have access<br />to infinite time and space,
9022883 9025146 but they're not<br />bound by anything!
9025190 9028671 They can't find<br />a specific place in time.
9028715 9029759 They can't communicate.
9031370 9034329 That's why I'm here. I'm gonna<br />find a way to tell Murph,
9034373 9036070 just like I found this moment.
9036114 9037376 TARS: <i>How, Cooper?</i>
9037419 9038768 Love, TARS, love.
9038812 9041075 It's just like Brand said.<br />My connection with Murph,
9041119 9043295 it is quantifiable.<br />It's the key!
9043338 9045123 TARS: <i>What are we here to do?</i>
9046037 9047560 Find how to tell her.
9050780 9052043 The watch.
9055437 9056569 The watch.
9057700 9058832 That's it.
9061574 9064359 We code the data into the<br />movement of the second hand.
9067884 9071192 TARS, translate the data<br />into Morse and feed it to me.
9071236 9073064 TARS: <i>Translating data</i><br /><i>into Morse.</i>
9073107 9075370 <i>Cooper, what if she</i><br /><i>never came back for it?</i>
9077155 9080201 She will. She will.
9081115 9083204 GETTY: Murph,<br />I can see his car!
9084162 9085380 He's coming, Murph!
9086903 9089210 Okay. I'm coming down.
9090298 9091734 TARS: <i>How do you know?</i>
9094998 9096522 Because I gave it to her.
9102267 9104443 TARS: <i>Roger. </i><br /><i>Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.</i>
9108186 9109535 COOPER: Dot-dot-

9132775 9133776 [GASPS]
9140087 9142437 MURPH: He came back!
9142481 9146485 It was him all this time!<br />I didn't know. It was him!
9147790 9149314 Dad's gonna save us.
9192444 9193880 Eureka!
9197275 9198624 It's traditional.
9201757 9204891 [LAUGHING] Eureka!
9209896 9211289 Did it work?
9211332 9213291 TARS: <i>I think it might have.</i>
9214857 9216424 How do you know?
9216468 9219297 TARS: <i>Because the bulk beings </i><br /><i>are closing the tesseract.</i>
9223083 9224998 Don't you get it yet, TARS?
9226391 9228001 They're not "beings."
9228958 9230264 They're us.
9232440 9235356 What I've been doing for<br />Murph, they're doing for me.
9236052 9237445 For all of us.
9237489 9240187 TARS: <i>Cooper, </i><br /><i>people couldn't build this.</i>
9240231 9242624 COOPER: No. No, not yet.
9242668 9243756 But one day.
9244931 9248239 Not you and me. But a people.
9249196 9250632 A civilization that's evolved
9250676 9253069 past the four dimensions<br />we know.
9253113 9254854 [BREATHING HEAVILY]
9259511 9260990 COOPER: What happens now?
9323792 9325011 DOCTOR: Mr. Cooper.
9329363 9331365 Let's take it slow, sir.
9331409 9333454 Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.
9333498 9335978 Remember, you're<br />no spring chicken anymore.
9336022 9338459 Actually,<br />you are 124 years old.
9342333 9344422 [PEOPLE PLAYING BASEBALL<br />OUTSIDE]
9345858 9347033 Take it slow, sir.
9348251 9350819 You were extremely lucky.
9350863 9352386 The Rangers found you<br />with only minutes left
9352430 9353953 in your oxygen supply.

9364920 9366705 [CHEERING AND LAUGHING]
9368141 9369447 Where am I?
9371318 9372841 DOCTOR: Cooper Station.
9374321 9375627 Currently orbiting Saturn.
9377803 9379544 Cooper Station.
9382373 9384287 Nice of you<br />to name it after me.
9384331 9385506 [LAUGHS]
9388030 9389118 What?
9389162 9391120 The station<br />isn't named after you, sir.
9391164 9393166 It's named<br />after your daughter.
9393209 9394950 Although she's<br />always maintained
9394994 9396256 just how important<br />you were.
9396299 9397779 Is she still alive?
9399651 9401000 She'll be here<br />in a couple weeks.
9402871 9404220 She is far too old
9404264 9405439 to be transferring<br />from another station,
9405483 9407789 but when she heard<br />that you'd been found...
9409008 9410226 Well, this is...
9410270 9411706 This is Murphy Cooper<br />we're talking about.
9412707 9413795 Yes, it is.
9416276 9419105 DOCTOR: We'll have you checked<br />out of here in a couple days.
9421586 9423762 I'm sure you'll be excited<br />to see what's in store.
9425067 9429550 I actually did a paper on you<br />in high school.
9429594 9431726 I know all about your life<br />back on Earth.
9433293 9434599 Oh, yeah.
9434903 9435948 Right.
9439038 9440169 If you'll follow me,
9440213 9443216 we've got a really<br />good situation for you.
9446959 9450702 So, um, when I made<br />my suggestion to Ms. Cooper,
9451920 9454836 I was delighted to hear that<br />she thought it was perfect.
9458405 9459450 OLD WOMAN 1:<br /><i>It was just constant.</i>
9459493 9461974 <i>Just that steady blow of dirt.</i>
9462017 9464890 Of course, I didn't<br />speak to her personally.
9464933 9466631 <i>We always</i><br /><i>set the plate upside-down.</i>
9466674 9469764 <i>Glasses or cups,</i><br /><i>whatever it was, upside-down.</i>
9469808 9474769 <i>My dad was a farmer.</i><br /><i>Like everybody else</i><br /><i>back then.</i>
9474813 9477642 <i>There just</i><br /><i>wasn't enough food.</i>
9477685 9480296 OLD WOMAN 2: <i>We wore </i><br /><i>little things, little strips</i>
9480340 9484518 <i>of sheet, put it sometimes</i><br /><i>over our nose and mouth,</i>
9484562 9485998 <i>so we wouldn't</i><br /><i>breathe so much of it.</i>
9486041 9489305 <i>Well, it was pretty exciting </i><br /><i>for me because it was hope.</i>
9489349 9491046 OLD MAN: <i>I don't care</i><br /><i>who describes it,</i>
9491090 9493571 <i>there is no way for it to be </i><br /><i>exaggerated. It was that bad.</i>
9493614 9495355 ADMINISTRATOR:<br />She did confirm
9495398 9497531 just how much<br />you loved farming.
9497575 9499272 Oh, she did, did she?Yeah.
9499315 9501056 Here we are.
9501100 9502797 Home sweet home.
9502841 9505887 Everything replaced<br />and put back where it...
9512328 9513373 Hey, is this...
9513416 9514983 Oh, yeah.
9515027 9517986 The machine we found<br />out near Saturn<br />when we found you, yes.
9518030 9519553 Its power source was shot,
9519597 9520859 but we could get you<br />another one if you want it.
9520902 9522904 Yes. Please.

9558157 9559288 Knock-knock.
9559332 9560942 You want 55?
9566034 9568210 TARS: Is this really<br />what it was like?
9570604 9572867 It was never this clean,<br />Slick. [CHUCKLES]
9577437 9579091 I don't care much for this
9579134 9581572 pretending we're back<br />where we started.
9583443 9585053 I want to know where we are.
9587360 9588709 <i>Where we're going.</i>
9593061 9595934 Mr. Cooper.<br />The family's all in there.
9596587 9597631 Family?
9597675 9599067 Yeah, they all came out<br />to see her.
9599111 9601722 She's been in cryo-sleep<br />for almost two years.
9618304 9619697 [SOBBING]
9634712 9637062 You told 'em I like farming.
9637105 9638237 [LAUGHING]
9642458 9643895 It was me, Murph.
9647115 9648639 I was your ghost.
9650075 9651206 I know.
9653382 9654949 People didn't believe me.
9654993 9657648 They thought that<br />I was doing it all myself.
9658300 9659345 But...
9661782 9663784 I knew who it was.
9668789 9670791 Nobody believed me.
9671705 9673838 But I knew you'd come back.
9676492 9677668 How?
9679582 9682673 Because my dad promised me.
9688766 9690942 Well, I'm here now, Murph.
9692247 9693379 I'm here.
9695163 9696164 No.
9698384 9702170 No parent should have to<br />watch their own child die.
9705565 9707741 I have my kids here<br />for me now.
9710613 9712093 You go.
9715488 9716837 Where?
9720623 9721973 Brand.
9731591 9733201 <i>She's out there,</i>
9739164 9741035 <i>setting up camp.</i>
9768149 9769455 <i>Alone</i>
9770978 9773154 <i>in a strange galaxy.</i>
9784339 9789518 <i>Maybe right now she's </i><br /><i>settling in for the long nap</i>
