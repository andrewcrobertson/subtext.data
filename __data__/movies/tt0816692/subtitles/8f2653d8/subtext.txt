74907 76993 <i>Well, my dad was a farmer.</i>
78160 80621 Um, like everybody else back then.
82748 84917 <i>Of course, he didn't start that way.</i>
91215 93134 <i>Computer says you're too tight.</i>
93301 95845 - Nah, I got this.<br /><i>- Crossing the Straights.</i>
98264 100016 <i>- Shutting it down, Cooper.</i><br />- No!
101517 103936 <i>- Shutting it all down.</i><br />- No, I need power up!
108274 109317 Dad?
115865 118367 Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.
118701 121203 - I thought you were the ghost.<br />- No.
122872 124874 There are no such things as ghosts, babe.
125041 127209 Grandpa says you can get ghosts.
128628 133382 Maybe that's because Grandpa's close<br />to being one himself. Back to bed.
133716 135551 Were you dreaming about the crash?
136969 139263 Get your butt back in bed, Murph. Heh.
166290 167792 <i>The wheat had died.</i>
168626 170961 <i>The blight came and we had to burn it.</i>
171879 174590 <i>And we still had corn.<br />We had acres of corn.</i>
174757 177009 But, uh, mostly we had dust.
179428 182056 <i>I guess I can't describe<br />it. It was just constant.</i>
182223 184684 Just that steady blow...
184850 186102 <i>of dirt.</i>
188187 191273 <i>We wore, um, little strips of sheet...</i>
191440 194151 sometimes over our nose and mouth...
194318 196821 <i>so that we wouldn't<br />breathe so much of it.</i>
198531 201033 <i>When we set the table,<br />we always set the plate...</i>
201200 204120 upside-down.<br />Glasses or cups, whatever it was...
204286 205454 <i>upside-down.</i>
210876 213129 Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!
213295 216757 Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn,<br />Herbicide Resistance 101.
216924 218426 - Check?<br />- Yes, sir.
219969 221637 Not at the table, Murph.
222388 224223 Dad, can you fix this?
225808 227143 What the heck did you do...
227309 228477 - to my lander?<br />- Wasn't me.
228644 230521 Let me guess. It was your ghost?
230688 233023 It knocked it off.<br />It keeps knocking books off.
233190 234692 No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.
234859 236986 - Hey.<br />- I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.
237153 238404 Dad, tell her.
238571 240489 Well, it's not very scientific, Murph.
240656 242992 You said science was about admitting<br />what we don't know.
243159 245327 - She's got you there.<br />- Hey.
245494 246996 Start looking after our stuff.
248622 249832 Coop.
252626 254795 All right, Murph, you want to talk science?
255755 259008 Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.<br />No, you got to go further.
259175 262344 You got to record the facts, analyze,<br />get to the how and the why...
262511 265431 then present your conclusions. Deal?
266098 267516 - Deal.<br />- All right.
270352 272521 - Have a good day at school.<br />- Hold up.
272855 275149 Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.
275316 277276 Not grandparent.
279528 281363 Slow down, turbo!
282698 285826 - That's not a dust storm.<br />- Nelson's torching his whole crop.
285993 287369 Blight?
287536 289955 They're saying it's the<br />last harvest for okra.
290623 291791 Ever.
293709 296337 He should've planted<br />corn like the rest of us.
296504 299215 Now, be nice to that<br />Miss Hanley. She's single.
299381 300883 What's that supposed to mean?
301050 304178 Repopulating the earth.<br />Start pulling your weight, young man.
304345 308307 Why don't you start<br />minding your own business, old man?
315606 317274 All right, Murph, give me second.
318901 320110 Uh-huh.
320694 322071 Third.
323614 325282 - Find a gear, dumb-ass.<br />- Grind it!
325449 326492 Shut it, Tom!
327868 330204 - What'd you do, Murph?<br />- Ah, she didn't do nothing.
330371 332873 - Blew a tire is all.<br />- Murphy's Law.
333707 335042 Shut up!
335209 336961 - Grab the spare, Tom.<br />- That is the spare.
339588 341090 Get the patch kit!
342383 345594 - How am I supposed to patch it out here?<br />- You got to figure it out.
345761 347721 I'm not always gonna be here to help you.
356146 357898 What's going on, Murph?
358065 361277 Why did you and Mom name me<br />after something that's bad?
361443 362820 We didn't.
363195 364697 Murphy's Law?
365656 369743 Murphy's Law doesn't mean<br />that something bad will happen.
369910 373289 What it means is<br />whatever can happen will happen.
373455 376000 And that sounded just fine with us.
380212 381755 Whoa!
382339 383632 Get in.
385009 386427 Get in, let's go.
387761 389889 What about the flat tire?
392850 394184 Yeah.
408157 412161 It's an Indian Air Force drone.<br />Solar cells could power an entire farm.
412328 413787 Take the wheel, Tom.
419251 420586 Go, go, go!
422171 423839 Keep that aimed right at it.
431764 434183 Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.
434850 435893 Right at it.
437394 438437 Stay on it.
440022 441106 Here we go.
444026 445235 Whoa.
450366 451951 Nice one, Tom.
458415 459792 Dad?
460209 462962 I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!
463420 464463 Dad!
464797 466006 Tom!
470552 472888 You told me to keep driving.
473722 478185 Well, I guess that answers the old "if I<br />asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.
481397 484233 - We lost it.<br />- No, we didn't.
496912 498580 Want to give it a whirl?
504586 505963 This way.
511343 512428 Go.
513429 516432 Let's lay her down right there<br />at the edge of the reservoir.
520728 522438 Nicely done.
525441 527317 How long you think it's been up there?
527484 530029 Delhi Mission Control went down,<br />same as ours...
530195 532031 - ten years ago.<br />- Heh.
532364 534283 So for ten years?
537244 539872 - Why did it come down so low?<br />- I don't know.
540039 542958 Maybe the sun cooked its brain<br />or it was looking for something.
543125 545377 - What?<br />- Give me a large flat blade.
545794 548464 Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know.
553719 555220 What are you gonna do with it?
556138 559308 I'm gonna give it something<br />socially responsible to do...
560184 561518 like drive a combine.
562102 563604 Can't we just let it go?
565898 567566 It wasn't hurting anybody.
569234 571737 This thing needs to learn<br />how to adapt, Murph...
572029 573530 like the rest of us.
578118 579828 How's this work?<br />You guys come with?
579995 581038 I've got class.
581455 583832 This one needs to wait.
585375 588170 - What did you do?<br />- They'll tell you about it in there.
588337 590506 - Am I gonna be mad?<br />- Not with me.
590672 593842 - Just please try not to.<br />- Hey. Relax.
595260 596595 I got this.
600849 602142 Little late, Coop.
602309 603852 Yeah, we had a flat.
604019 607564 And I guess you had to stop off<br />at the Asian fighter plane store.
607856 611443 No, actually, sir, that's<br />a surveillance drone.
611610 614363 With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian.
614780 616115 Take a seat.
617241 618742 So, uh...
619451 622037 we got Tom's scores back.
622579 624540 He's going to make an excellent farmer.
624706 628210 Yeah, he's got a knack for it.<br />What about college?
628377 632131 The university only takes a handful.<br />They don't have the resources to...
632297 634591 I still pay my taxes.
634758 636760 Where's that money go?<br />There's no more armies.
637261 639596 Well, it doesn't go to the university.
640180 641807 Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.
641974 644768 You're ruling my son out for college now?
645310 648814 - The kid's 15.<br />- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
649815 651984 What's your waistline? About what, 32?
652401 656071 - About a 33 inseam?<br />- I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.
656238 660659 It takes two numbers to measure your ass<br />but only one to measure my son's future?
661535 664413 Come on. You're a well-educated man, Coop.
664580 666540 - And a trained pilot.<br />- And an engineer.
667040 671795 Okay, well, right now<br />we don't need more engineers.
672254 676592 We didn't run out of television screens<br />and planes. We ran out of food.
676925 680345 The world needs farmers.<br />Good farmers, like you.
680512 682890 - And Tom.<br />- Uneducated farmers.
683807 687728 We're a caretaker generation, Coop.<br />And things are getting better.
687895 691023 - Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...<br />- Are we done here, sir?
692316 693400 No.
694234 696403 Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.
696737 699281 Murph is a great kid. She's really bright.
699448 701700 But she's been having<br />a little trouble lately.
701867 705245 She brought this in to show the students.<br />The section on the lunar landings.
705412 707915 Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.
708373 710375 She always loved the pictures.
710542 714254 It's an old federal textbook. We've<br />replaced them with the corrected versions.
714421 715464 Corrected?
715631 719760 Explaining how the Apollo missions<br />were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
726475 728435 You don't believe we went to the moon?
729561 731563 It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.
731730 734566 The Soviets bankrupted themselves<br />pouring resources...
734733 736985 into rockets and other useless machines.
737152 738237 "Useless machines."
738403 742491 If we don't want a repeat of the excess and<br />wastefulness of the 20th century, then...
742658 746453 we need to teach our kids about<br />this planet, not tales of leaving it.
747287 751291 One of those useless machines<br />they used to make was called an MRl.
751667 755003 If we had any of those left,<br />the doctors would've been able to find...
755170 758924 the cyst in my wife's brain<br />before she died instead of afterwards.
759091 762177 Then she'd have been the one<br />listening to this instead of me...
762344 765430 which would have been a good thing,<br />because she was always...
766014 767516 the calmer one.
768183 770269 I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.
771520 775190 But Murph got into a fistfight<br />with several of her classmates over this...
775357 777025 Apollo nonsense.
777192 779653 So we thought it best<br />to bring you in and see what ideas...
779820 782489 you might have for dealing<br />with her behavior on the home front.
783699 786743 Yeah, you know what?<br />Um, there's a game tomorrow night.
786910 789037 She's going through a<br />bit of a baseball phase.
789204 793417 Her favorite team is playing.<br />There's gonna be candy and soda and...
796503 798338 I think I'll take her to that.
803677 804928 How'd it go?
805846 807723 I got you suspended.
808140 809474 - What?<br /><i>- Cooper.</i>
811226 812394 This is Cooper. Go.
812561 815397 <i>Coop, those combines you rebuilt<br />went haywire.</i>
815564 817733 Just reset the controllers.
818066 820694 <i>I did that. Now you<br />should come take a look.</i>
840422 843425 One by one they've been<br />peeling off the fields and heading over.
843592 845427 Something's interfering with the compass.
846928 849306 Magnetism or some such.
892224 893892 Nothing special about which book.
894559 896812 I've been working on it, like you said.
897562 900065 - I counted the spaces.<br />- Why?
902109 904194 In case the ghost is trying to communicate.
904986 906530 I'm trying Morse.
907114 908365 Morse?
908698 909783 Yeah.
910200 912828 - Dots and dashes, used...<br />- I know what Morse code is, Murph.
912994 915914 I just don't think<br />your bookshelf's trying to talk to you.
927509 931888 Had to reset every compass clock and GPS<br />to offset for the anomaly.
932180 934724 - Which is?<br />- I don't know.
936518 938645 If the house was built on magnetic ore...
938812 941898 we'd have seen this the first time<br />we switched on the tractor.
944568 947737 I hear your meeting at the school<br />didn't go so well.
948363 950073 Heh. You heard?
951032 953869 It's like we've forgotten<br />who we are, Donald.
955537 959040 Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.
960750 962377 When I was a kid...
962544 966673 it felt like they made something new<br />every day. Some...
967048 970343 gadget or idea.<br />Like every day was Christmas.
970802 973472 But six billion people...
973889 975891 just try to imagine that.
976892 979895 And every last one of them<br />trying to have it all.
983273 985192 This world isn't so bad.
987444 989654 And Tom will do just fine.
989821 994201 You're the one who doesn't belong. Born<br />40 years too late, or 40 years too early.
995202 997704 My daughter knew it, God bless her.
998580 1001374 And your kids know it. Especially Murph.
1001708 1005128 Well, we used to look up in the sky<br />and wonder...
1005295 1007672 at our place in the stars.
1010091 1014471 Now we just look down and worry<br />about our place in the dirt.
1014971 1017807 Cooper, you were good at something...
1018141 1020644 and you never got a chance<br />to do anything with it.
1021436 1022771 I'm sorry.
1024481 1025899 <i>You didn't expect...</i>
1026066 1028610 this dirt that was<br />giving you this food...
1028944 1032030 to turn on you like<br />that and destroy you.
1032531 1036660 In April... I believe I'm right...<br />Fifteenth of April, I think.
1037118 1039412 This happened about 1:30 when that thing...
1039746 1041498 came off the top of that canyon.
1043208 1045335 In my day, we had real ballplayers.
1045502 1047254 Who are these bums?
1047629 1050131 In my day, people were too busy...
1050298 1052342 fighting over food<br />to even play baseball.
1052634 1057514 Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.<br />I want a hot dog.
1057681 1059808 School says you're gonna follow<br />in my footsteps.
1060559 1062060 I think that's great.
1062352 1065647 - You think that's great?<br />- You hate farming, Dad.
1066439 1068066 Grandpa said.
1068233 1069651 Grandpa said, huh?
1070068 1072612 Listen, all that matters<br />is how you feel about it.
1072779 1074447 I like what you do.
1075156 1076658 I like our farm.
1077325 1078952 You're gonna be great at it.
1091798 1093300 Let's get out of here.
1100557 1102559 All right, it's a doozy.
1103268 1105103 All right, gang, let's mask up.
1108440 1110442 - Tom? Murph? Check?<br />- Yeah.
1163995 1166581 Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?
1171002 1172087 Murph?
1193483 1194776 The ghost.
1196027 1197654 Grab your pillow.
1198446 1200281 You're sleeping in with Tom.
1255211 1256880 It's not a ghost.
1262302 1263720 It's gravity.
1265472 1267724 I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town.
1268016 1272187 You want to clean that up<br />when you've finished praying to it?
1297545 1299798 It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.
1300298 1302258 Thick is one, thin is zero.
1306721 1308056 Coordinates.
1310642 1313144 Nope. Mm-mm.
1314604 1315772 Here we go.
1317357 1318733 Thirty-three.
1321694 1322737 That's it.
1324197 1325698 I can't miss this!
1326032 1329202 Grandpa will be back in<br />a couple hours, Murph.
1329994 1332664 But you don't know what you're gonna find.
1333665 1334999 And that...
1336084 1338169 is why I can't take you.
1344259 1345385 Murph?
1347470 1350974 Grandpa will be home in a while.<br />Tell him I'll call him on the radio.
1357146 1358398 - Aah!<br />- Jesus.
1359399 1361317 - What are you doing?<br />- Heh-heh.
1361484 1363611 Oh, you think this is funny? Huh?
1363945 1366281 You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.
1368116 1370118 Make yourself useful.
1433473 1434807 Hey, Murph?
1436434 1437477 Murph!
1440980 1443316 I think this is the end of the road.
1446319 1448363 Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?
1449530 1450782 That's my girl.
1478518 1479769 Step away!
1479936 1483022 Don't shoot! I'm not armed.<br />My daughter's in the car.
1488569 1490822 - Don't be afraid.<br />- Aah!
1503543 1505628 How did you find this place?
1506337 1507672 Where's my daughter?
1507964 1511884 You had the coordinates for this facility<br />marked on your map. Where did you get them?
1512051 1513386 Where's my daughter?
1513553 1516472 Don't make me take you down again.<br />Sit down!
1516806 1519017 Oh, you still think you're a Marine, pal?
1519183 1521769 Marines don't exist anymore.
1522061 1527025 - And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.<br />- Where did you find those coordinates?
1527191 1529777 But you don't look much like a lawnmower.
1529944 1532780 Think I'll turn you<br />into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.
1532947 1534157 No, you won't.
1535783 1537702 TARS, back down, please.
1539203 1542331 You know, you're taking a risk<br />using ex-military security.
1542790 1546627 They're old, and their control units<br />are unpredictable.
1546794 1548796 It's what the government could spare.
1550465 1551632 Who are you?
1552091 1553426 Dr. Brand.
1553593 1555970 I knew a Dr. Brand<br />once. He was a professor.
1556345 1557847 What makes you think I'm not?
1558306 1560641 Wasn't near as cute, either.
1560975 1563478 Please, Dr. Brand.<br />I don't have any idea what this is.
1564312 1566814 Now I'm scared for my daughter<br />and want her by my side.
1566981 1569442 You give me that,<br />I'll tell you anything you want to know.
1572820 1575823 Get the principals and the girl<br />in the conference room, please.
1577158 1578534 Your daughter is fine.
1578993 1580036 Bright kid.
1580620 1582455 Must have a very smart mother.
1582622 1585041 It's pretty clear you<br />don't want any visitors.
1585208 1589170 So why don't you just let us back up from<br />your fence and we'll be on our way? Huh?
1589462 1592006 - It's not that simple.<br />- Well, sure, it is.
1592340 1596010 I don't know anything about you.<br />I don't know anything about this place.
1596886 1598054 Yes, you do.
1603768 1604852 Dad!
1607522 1608564 Hello, Cooper.
1610024 1611067 Professor Brand.
1613236 1615196 Explain to me how you found this facility.
1615363 1618658 Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled<br />upon it. We were on a salvage run...
1618825 1621536 You're sitting in the best-kept secret<br />in the world.
1621702 1625206 Nobody stumbles in here.<br />Nobody stumbles out.
1625540 1627208 Cooper, please.
1627667 1629752 Cooperate with these people.
1629919 1631129 Look.
1632046 1633714 It's kind of hard to explain.
1634048 1638219 We learned these coordinates<br />from an anomaly.
1638970 1640304 What sort of anomaly?
1640471 1643766 I hesitate to term it supernatural,<br />but it definitely wasn't scientific.
1643933 1647854 You're going to have to be specific,<br />Mr. Cooper. Right now.
1648020 1649272 It was gravity.
1652942 1657155 Um, what sort of gravitational anomaly?<br />Where was this?
1657321 1660616 Now, I'm real happy that you're excited<br />about gravity, bud...
1660783 1663995 but you're not getting any<br />answers from us until I get assurances.
1664162 1665454 - Assurances?<br />- Yeah.
1666289 1669750 Like, that we're getting out of here.<br />And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.
1672295 1674422 Don't you know who we are, Coop?
1674589 1675840 No, professor, I don't.
1676007 1678009 You know my father, Professor Brand.
1678634 1679927 We're NASA.
1681721 1683931 - NASA?<br />- NASA.
1684265 1686058 The same NASA you flew for.
1697111 1698779 I heard they shut you down, sir...
1698946 1701240 for refusing to drop bombs<br />from the stratosphere...
1701407 1702950 onto starving people.
1703117 1705453 When they realized<br />that killing other people was...
1705620 1708456 not a long-term solution,<br />then they needed us back.
1708623 1710625 - In secret.<br />- Why secret?
1710791 1714629 Because public opinion wouldn't<br />allow spending on space exploration.
1715087 1717381 Not while you're struggling<br />to put food on the table.
1718799 1719967 Blight.
1720426 1724263 Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.
1725014 1726682 Now there's just corn.
1727016 1728976 And we're growing more than we ever have.
1729143 1733314 But like the potatoes in Ireland<br />and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...
1733898 1736400 the corn will die.
1737151 1738194 Soon.
1743491 1747078 We'll find a way,<br />professor. We always have.
1747828 1751832 Driven by the unshakable faith<br />the Earth is ours.
1752333 1754210 Not just ours, no.
1755002 1756337 But it is our home.
1757672 1761008 Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.
1761175 1762885 We don't even breathe nitrogen.
1763052 1768391 Blight does. And as it thrives,<br />our air gets less and less oxygen.
1768557 1772019 The last people to starve<br />will be the first to suffocate.
1772186 1774355 And your daughter's generation...
1776023 1778276 will be the last to survive on Earth.
1778442 1782029 Murph is tired. I was wondering<br />if she could take a nap in my office.
1782530 1784031 Yeah. Thank you.
1786826 1787868 Okay...
1788869 1792373 now you need to tell me<br />what your plan is to save the world.
1793040 1796544 We're not meant to save the world.<br />We're meant to leave it.
1802383 1803426 Rangers.
1803718 1808681 The last components of our one<br />versatile ship in orbit, the <i>Endurance.</i>
1808973 1810599 Our final expedition.
1811392 1814353 You sent people out there<br />looking for a new home?
1814979 1816272 The Lazarus missions.
1816605 1819567 - Oh, that sounds cheerful.<br />- Lazarus came back from the dead.
1819900 1821902 Sure, but he had to die in the first place.
1822528 1825239 There's not a planet in our solar system<br />that could sustain life...
1825406 1827908 and the nearest star's<br />over a thousand years away.
1828075 1830745 That doesn't even qualify as futile.
1832413 1833748 Where'd you send them?
1834165 1835583 Cooper...
1835750 1838544 I can't tell you anymore<br />unless you agree...
1838711 1840546 to pilot this craft.
1840713 1844008 - You're the best pilot we ever had.<br />- I barely left the stratosphere.
1844300 1846427 This team never left the simulator.
1846761 1850556 We need a pilot, and this is the mission<br />that you were trained for.
1850723 1852224 Without even knowing it?
1853267 1857521 An hour ago, you didn't even know<br />I was alive. You were going anyway.
1857688 1859398 We had no choice.
1859565 1861317 But something sent you here.
1861650 1864362 - They chose you.<br />- Who's "they"?
1872328 1874246 How long would I be gone?
1874830 1877750 Hard to know. Years?
1878459 1880086 I've got kids, professor.
1880586 1882630 Get out there and save them.
1886008 1887385 Who's "they"?
1887551 1891347 We started detecting gravitational<br />anomalies almost 50 years ago.
1891680 1895309 Mostly small distortions to our instruments<br />in the upper atmosphere.
1895476 1898604 In fact, I believe<br />you encountered one yourself.
1899271 1901273 Yeah, over the Straights.
1902274 1905319 My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire.
1905486 1906695 Exactly.
1907530 1912451 But of all these anomalies,<br />the most significant is this:
1912618 1914620 Out near Saturn...
1914787 1916872 a disturbance of space-time.
1918999 1922128 - Is that a wormhole?<br />- It appeared 48 years ago.
1922586 1924505 And it leads where?
1925047 1926674 Another galaxy.
1928426 1930678 A wormhole's not<br />a naturally occurring phenomenon.
1930845 1932263 Someone placed it there.
1933055 1934557 - "They"?<br />- Mm.
1935057 1939145 And whoever they are,<br />they appear to be looking out for us.
1939603 1942189 That wormhole lets<br />us travel to other stars.
1942356 1944275 It came along right as we needed it.
1944442 1947361 They've put potentially habitable worlds<br />right within our reach.
1947528 1949447 Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.
1949613 1951991 - You sent probes into that?<br />- Mm-hm.
1952158 1955161 We sent people into it. Ten years ago.
1956495 1958164 The Lazarus missions.
1958497 1959707 Twelve possible worlds...
1959874 1962209 twelve Ranger launches carrying...
1962668 1965087 the bravest humans ever to live...
1965254 1967882 led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.
1968382 1971385 Each person's landing pod<br />had enough life support for two years.
1971552 1973512 But they could use hibernation<br />to stretch that...
1973679 1976891 making observations on organics<br />over a decade or more.
1977057 1980895 Their mission was to assess their world,<br />and if it showed potential...
1981228 1985649 then they could send out a signal, bed<br />down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.
1985816 1987860 And what if the world didn't show promise?
1988486 1989904 Hence the bravery.
1990696 1993240 You don't have the resources<br />to visit all 12.
1993407 1994533 No.
1995409 1998204 Data transmission back through<br />the wormhole is rudimentary.
1998370 2003417 Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us<br />some clue as to which worlds have potential.
2003584 2005377 And one system shows promise.
2005711 2008255 One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?
2009089 2011926 One system with three potential worlds?
2012343 2013928 No long shot.
2016096 2017223 Okay.
2017932 2020267 So if we find a home...
2022937 2026398 - then what?<br />- That's the long shot.
2026732 2029944 There's a Plan A and a Plan B.
2030444 2033405 Did you notice anything strange<br />about the launch chamber?
2045125 2048045 This entire facility's a centrifuge.
2048379 2050881 Some kind of vehicle. A space station?
2051215 2052967 Both. Plan A.
2053133 2055219 How do you get it off the ground?
2055386 2059056 The first gravitational anomalies<br />changed everything.
2059390 2063727 Suddenly we knew<br />that harnessing gravity was real.
2064061 2068732 So I started working on a theory<br />and we started building this station.
2069108 2071193 But you haven't solved it yet.
2072278 2073821 That's why there's Plan B.
2074321 2079034 The problem is gravity. How to get a<br />viable amount of human life off the planet.
2079201 2080494 This is one way.
2080828 2083330 Plan B: a population bomb.
2083664 2088419 Over 5,000 fertilized eggs<br />weighing in at just under 900 kilos.
2089128 2090629 How would you raise them?
2090796 2093257 With equipment on board,<br />we incubate the first 10.
2093424 2097303 After that, with surrogacy,<br />the growth becomes exponential.
2098012 2101307 Within 30 years,<br />we could have a colony of hundreds.
2101473 2104852 The real difficulty with colonization<br />is genetic diversity.
2105477 2107021 This takes care of that.
2107187 2109648 But what about the people here? You just...
2110024 2111358 give up on them?
2111984 2113235 My kids?
2113777 2117114 That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.
2119366 2122244 - How far have you got?<br />- Almost there.
2122411 2124830 You're asking me to hang everything...
2125873 2127207 on an almost.
2127750 2130044 I'm asking you to trust me.
2133130 2134798 Find us a new home.
2135549 2137551 And by the time you return...
2138135 2140804 I will have solved<br />the problem of gravity.
2141764 2143349 I give you my word.
2155986 2157488 Go away!
2168165 2169208 Murph.
2169583 2172586 Go! If you're leaving, just go.
2175381 2178217 This world was never enough<br />for you, was it, Coop?
2179051 2182805 What, because heading out there<br />is what I feel like I was born to do?
2183764 2185599 And it excites me? Heh.
2186308 2188769 No, that does not make it wrong.
2188936 2190062 It might.
2190437 2193565 Don't trust the right thing<br />done for the wrong reason.
2194316 2196652 The why of the thing,<br />that's the foundation.
2196819 2198904 And the foundation's solid.
2202074 2207079 We farmers, we sit here every year<br />when the rains fail and we say:
2207371 2208622 "Next year."
2209289 2212960 Well, next year ain't gonna save us,<br />nor the one after that.
2213794 2217923 This world's a treasure, Donald, but it's<br />been telling us to leave for a while now.
2222636 2226432 Mankind was born on Earth,<br />it was never meant to die here.
2229560 2232771 Tom will be all right, but you got<br />to make things right with Murph.
2232938 2233981 I will.
2234940 2238110 Without making promises<br />you don't know you can keep.
2248746 2250748 You have to talk to me, Murph.
2253250 2255377 I need to fix this before I go.
2255544 2258422 Then I'll keep it broken<br />so you have to stay.
2260007 2265012 After you kids came along, your mom said<br />something to me I never quite understood.
2265387 2267014 She said, "Now..."
2268891 2273395 "We're just here<br />to be memories for our kids."
2278525 2281028 And I think that now I understand<br />what she meant.
2284782 2288535 Once you're a parent,<br />you're the ghost of your children's future.
2290162 2292331 You said ghosts didn't exist.
2298796 2300297 That's right, Murph.
2303509 2304843 Murph, look at me.
2307888 2310390 I can't be your ghost right now.
2312184 2314186 I need to exist.
2315813 2317731 They chose me.
2318440 2322402 Murph, they chose me. You saw.<br />You're the one who led me to them.
2325030 2327533 That's exactly why you can't go.
2330744 2332704 I figured out the message.
2333121 2336333 - One word. Know what it is?<br />- Murph.
2336500 2337835 "Stay."
2338210 2341088 - It says, "Stay," Dad.<br />- Murph.
2342047 2343507 You don't believe me.
2343674 2346468 Look at the books! Look at this.<br />It says, "Stay."
2346635 2349596 Why...? You're not<br />listening! It says, "Stay!"
2349930 2351765 No, I'm coming back.
2351932 2353267 When?
2366280 2368740 One for you, one for me.
2369116 2372286 When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...
2372619 2375163 traveling near the speed of light, or...
2376164 2378292 near a black hole...
2378750 2383297 time's gonna change for me.<br />It's gonna run more slowly.
2384882 2386675 When we get back...
2387801 2389219 we're gonna compare.
2389386 2392014 - Time will run differently for us?<br />- Yeah.
2393098 2397769 By the time I get back,<br />we might even be the same age, you and me.
2398145 2400480 "What?" Imagine that!
2405027 2406194 Aw, Murph...
2406361 2408989 You have no idea when you're coming back.
2410782 2412284 No idea at all!
2415412 2417539 Murph, don't... Don't<br />make me leave like this.
2417706 2419207 Come on, Murph!
2419708 2422044 Don't make me leave like this, Murph!
2429635 2430677 Hey...
2431219 2432554 I love you.
2432930 2434848 Forever. You hear me?
2435307 2438518 I love you forever, and I'm coming back.
2444316 2445651 I'm coming back.
2463877 2466046 - How'd it go?<br />- Fine.
2466797 2468256 Just fine.
2474721 2475847 I love you, Tom.
2476390 2478517 - Travel safe, huh?<br />- Yeah.
2478684 2480936 You look after our place for me, all right?
2481103 2482729 - All right?<br />- Uh-huh.
2487234 2490612 - Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?<br />- You mean your truck?
2492114 2493740 I'll make sure they bring it back.
2495867 2497661 Look after my kids, Donald!
2510132 2513760 <i>Go form a in engine start. T-minus 10...</i>
2514428 2516513 - Dad!<br /><i>- Nine...</i>

2552632 2555469 Prepare for stage one separation.
2555802 2556845 Stage one.
2562809 2564644 There is Mach 1.
2565604 2569316 Everybody good?<br />Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?
2571193 2574488 They gave him a humor setting<br />so he'd fit in better with his unit.
2574821 2576490 He thinks it relaxes us.
2576656 2579451 A giant sarcastic robot.
2580327 2581745 What a great idea!
2581912 2584623 I have a cue light I can use<br />when I'm joking if you like.
2584790 2585832 That'd probably help.
2585999 2589920 You can use it to find your way back to<br />the ship after I blow you out the airlock.
2591004 2594007 - What's your humor setting, TARS?<br />- That's 100 percent.
2594174 2595967 Let's bring it on down to 75, please.
2596301 2598136 Stage two separation.
2608814 2610982 All feeds going manual.
2611274 2612692 Going manual.
2614986 2617155 Deactivate probe heater one, two and three.
2617322 2618365 Check.
2623954 2626873 - Taking control.<br />- This is handover to you.
2630710 2633004 - A.D.F. check.<br />- Over.
2633338 2637008 Pull thrusters back.<br />Fuel cells one, two, three.
2637175 2638510 One hundred percent.
2638677 2640512 Ex-mites.
2649479 2651314 It's hard leaving everything.
2651690 2654192 My kids. Your father.
2654818 2657195 We're going to be spending<br />a lot of time together.
2657362 2660407 - We should learn to talk.<br />- And when not to.
2662701 2664244 Just being honest.
2664411 2666746 I don't think you need to be that honest.
2667164 2669583 Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?
2669749 2672377 - Ninety percent.<br />- Ninety percent?
2672544 2675589 Absolute honesty isn't always<br />the most diplomatic, nor the...
2675755 2678341 safest form of communication<br />with emotional beings.
2678508 2679968 Okay.
2680427 2683054 Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.
2686766 2689978 We are coming up on the <i>Endurance.</i><br />Twelve minutes out.
2707078 2709080 Okay. Taking control.
2712542 2715420 Approaching module port, 500 meters.
2728433 2729559 It's all you, Doyle.
2748119 2750580 Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.
2755752 2757003 I feel good.
2757170 2758338 Take us home.
2766137 2768473 - Lock.<br />- Target locked.
2768640 2770475 - Well done.<br />- Okay, helmets on.
2770642 2771685 Good job.
2805135 2806886 Door's not charging.
2807053 2808555 Never mind.
2831328 2833038 Cooper, you should have control.
2833371 2834873 Control here.
2836291 2838918 <i>Communication with ring module active.</i>
2845383 2846926 Oh, wow.
2852724 2853892 That's initiate.
2861441 2863943 <i>- Are we ready to spin?</i><br />- Just a sec.
2875372 2877707 - Hello, CASE.<br />- Hello, TARS.
2878666 2880585 All right, we're all set.
2881044 2882545 All right, let's do it.
2900855 2902357 Heh.
2911699 2912992 <i>Thirty percent of spin.</i>
2919916 2921251 <i>One G.</i>
2922001 2924003 <i>How's gravity treating you back there?</i>
2924337 2925505 Well.
2928675 2930468 Romilly? Hey, you okay?
2930635 2931678 - Yeah.<br />- You all right?
2931845 2933930 Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.
2934347 2939018 We have some Dramamine in the hab pod, or<br />maybe in the cryo-beds. I'll just be a sec.
2939185 2941354 - Hey, Brand?<br />- Yeah?
2941688 2943523 - Bring a lot.<br />- Heh-heh-heh.
2951990 2954868 <i>Amelia, be safe.</i>
2955201 2958705 <i>- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.</i><br />- I will, Dad.
2958872 2960790 <i>It looks good for your trajectory.</i>
2960957 2964294 <i>We've calculated two years to Saturn.</i>
2965044 2966546 That's a lot of Dramamine.
2967255 2969716 Look after my family,<br />will you, please, sir?
2970258 2973052 <i>We'll be waiting for you when you get back.</i>
2973553 2977390 <i>A little older, a little wiser,<br />but happy to see you.</i>
2980226 2983563 <i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>
2984230 2988276 <i>Old age should burn<br />and rave at close of day</i>
2989444 2994407 <i>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</i>
2995283 2999078 <i>Though wise men at their end<br />Know dark is right</i>
2999412 3002290 <i>Because their words had forked<br />No lightning they</i>
3002707 3006252 <i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>
3006920 3011257 <i>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</i>
3027857 3029526 - You good?<br />- Yeah.
3030443 3031945 Okay, thank you.
3035448 3036783 Here. Pills.
3039536 3040954 So alone.
3041454 3043414 We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.
3043581 3044958 No, I mean them.
3045124 3046251 Hm?
3046417 3049712 It's a perfect planet,<br />and we won't find another one like her.
3050296 3053550 No, it's not like looking for a new condo.
3054676 3056844 The human race is going to be...
3057345 3058388 adrift...
3058555 3062058 desperate for a rock it can cling to<br />while it catches its breath.
3062642 3064477 We need to find that rock.
3064811 3067522 And our three prospects<br />are at the edge of what...
3067689 3069566 might sustain human life.
3070066 3072527 Laura Miller's planet is first.
3072694 3074821 - Laura started our biology program.<br />- Mm-hm.
3079826 3082996 - Uh, Wolf Edmunds is here.<br />- Tell me about Edmunds.
3083830 3086583 Oh, uh, Wolf's a particle physicist.
3088876 3091212 None of them had families, huh?
3092255 3095133 No. No attachments. My father insisted.
3095300 3098845 They all knew the odds against<br />ever seeing another human being again.
3099012 3100972 I'm hoping we can surprise<br />at least three of them.
3101139 3103057 - How about Mann?<br />- Dr. Mann?
3103224 3105143 He's remarkable. He's the best of us.
3105310 3109689 He inspired 11 people to follow him<br />on the loneliest journey in human history.
3109856 3111441 Scientists, explorers.
3111608 3115695 That's what I love.<br />You know, out there we face great odds.
3116195 3117614 Death, but...
3119365 3120700 not evil.
3120992 3122744 You don't think nature can be evil?
3123119 3125788 No. Formidable. Frightening. But...
3126581 3128583 - no, not evil.<br />- Hm.
3129834 3133046 Is a lion evil<br />because it rips a gazelle to shreds?
3133546 3135548 Just what we take with us, then.
3136090 3137133 Yeah.
3137550 3139636 This crew represents the best of humanity.
3139802 3140970 Even me, huh?
3141137 3143139 You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.
3143306 3144390 There you go.
3144807 3147185 - Don't stay up.<br />- I'll be there in a minute.
3147352 3151397 Just remember, Coop,<br />you are literally wasting your breath.
3158071 3161240 Hey, TARS? Let's go over<br />that trajectory one more time.
3161574 3163242 Eight months to Mars.
3163743 3166579 Counter-orbital slingshot around.<br />Fourteen months to Saturn.
3166746 3168164 Nothing's changed on that.
3168331 3170416 Just let me ask you something.
3172669 3176130 - Dr. Brand and Edmunds...<br />- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.
3177590 3180593 Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?
3180760 3182178 I wouldn't know.
3182345 3185348 Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"<br />or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?
3185515 3188643 - I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.<br />- Aah.
3190103 3192271 But not a poker face, Slick.
3204617 3205868 Hey, guys.
3206285 3209372 Uh, Dad's about to go<br />down for the long nap.
3209706 3212333 <i>So I wanted to give you an update.</i>
3212500 3213626 <i>Uh...</i>
3214168 3217880 <i>The Earth looks amazing from here. Um...</i>
3218423 3221259 <i>You can't see any of the dust. Heh.</i>
3221426 3225555 <i>Um, I really hope you guys are doing great.</i>
3225888 3230143 <i>I know you'll get this message. Professor<br />Brand's assured me he'll get it to you.</i>
3230685 3232729 <i>Know that I love you.</i>
3234147 3236482 - Is it him?<br />- I don't think so, Murph.
3243364 3245032 You must be Donald.
3247243 3248411 Hello, Murph.
3249162 3251164 Why are you in my dad's truck?
3251789 3253958 He wanted me to bring it for your brother.
3254709 3256878 He sent you a message.
3259964 3261966 She's pretty upset with him for leaving.
3262133 3266220 If you record any messages,<br />I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.
3267305 3269974 Murph is a bright spark.
3270975 3273519 Maybe I should fan the flame.
3273686 3276272 She's already making fools of her teachers.
3276439 3279275 So maybe she should come<br />and make a fool out of you.
3280359 3283196 - So where are they?<br />- Heading for Mars.
3283905 3287909 The next time you hear from Cooper,<br />they'll be coming up on Saturn.
3327865 3329575 <i>As far as school goes...</i>
3329742 3332912 <i>the administration wants me<br />to repeat Plant Pathology. Which sucks.</i>
3333412 3336624 <i>But they said I could start<br />Advanced Agriculture a year early.</i>
3338417 3342296 <i>All right, I got to go, Dad.<br />Hope you're safe up there.</i>
3346342 3347927 <i>Um, sorry, Coop.</i>
3348094 3352932 <i>I asked Murph to say hi,<br />but she's as stubborn as her old man.</i>
3353349 3355184 <i>I'll try again next time.</i>
3370199 3371784 You all right, Rom?
3374120 3375955 This gets to me, Cooper.
3376122 3377790 This. This.
3378291 3381168 Millimeters of aluminum, that's it,<br />and then nothing...
3381335 3385298 out there for millions of miles<br />won't kill us in seconds.
3386215 3388134 You know that some of the finest...
3388301 3392138 solo yachtsmen in the world<br />don't know how to swim?
3392722 3395892 They don't know how. And if they<br />go overboard, psst, they're done.
3397643 3399604 We're explorers, Rom.
3401147 3402857 This is our boat.
3403024 3404150 Here.
3431260 3433012 This is from the, uh, relay probe?
3433179 3435222 It was in orbit around the wormhole.
3435723 3438768 This is the wormhole,<br />and every time we'd come around...
3438935 3442146 we would receive images<br />from the other side of the foreign galaxy.
3442480 3444607 Oh, yeah. Like swinging a periscope around.
3444774 3445858 Exactly.
3446025 3450529 So we got a pretty good idea what<br />we're gonna find on the other side, huh?
3451614 3452949 Navigationally.
3454408 3458162 <i>Guys? We'll be approaching<br />the wormhole in about three hours.</i>
3464543 3465586 Hey, Coop?
3466462 3468214 Can we stop the spinning?
3468381 3469465 Why?
3469632 3471968 Because we're close enough to see it now?
3473803 3474929 All right.
3475096 3476180 Thanks.
3481936 3483896 There, that's it! That's the wormhole!
3484063 3485856 Say it, don't spray it, Rom.
3486232 3487525 It's a sphere.
3487692 3491654 Of course it is. What, you...?<br />You thought it would just be a hole?
3492863 3495950 No, it's just that all the illustrations<br />I've ever seen, they...
3496492 3499578 In the illustrations,<br />they're trying to show you how it works.
3500287 3504125 So they say you want to go<br />from here to there.
3504458 3507003 - But it's too far, right?<br />- Mm-hm.
3507169 3511966 So a wormhole bends space like this,<br />so you can take a shortcut through...
3512299 3513884 a higher dimension.
3514051 3515511 Okay, so...
3515845 3519765 to show that, they've turned<br />three-dimensional space into two dimensions...
3519932 3523894 which turns a wormhole<br />into two dimensions, a circle.
3524061 3526313 What's a circle in three dimensions?
3527523 3529025 - A sphere.<br />- Exactly.
3529442 3530943 A spherical hole.
3531485 3534321 But who put it there?<br />Who do we have to thank?
3534739 3539410 I'm not thanking anybody<br />until we get out of here in one piece, Rom.
3546625 3548044 Any trick to this, Doyle?
3549378 3551047 No one knows.
3558179 3559847 The others made it, right?
3561891 3563559 At least some of them.
3595508 3598677 Everybody ready to say goodbye<br />to our solar system?
3599553 3601555 To our galaxy.
3603474 3604517 Here we go.
3637133 3640636 The controls won't work here.<br />We're passing through the bulk.
3640803 3645224 It's space beyond our three dimensions.<br />All you can do is record and observe.
3656402 3657444 What is that?
3659822 3661657 I think it's them.
3661991 3663826 Distorting space-time.
3665911 3666996 Don't! Don't!
3695024 3696275 What was that?
3699278 3700779 The first handshake.
3702448 3703490 We're...
3705117 3706452 We're here.
3726805 3729058 So the lost communications came through.
3729225 3732102 - How?<br />- The relay on this side cached them.
3732269 3735814 So years of basic data. No real surprises.
3736732 3740569 Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,<br />as has Dr. Mann's. Um...
3740736 3742863 Edmunds' went down three years ago.
3743030 3744240 Transmitter failure?
3744406 3747409 Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up<br />right until it went dark.
3747576 3749336 But Miller's still looks<br />good though, right?
3749495 3751789 - Because she's coming up fast.<br />- Mm-hm.
3752248 3754250 With one complication.
3754667 3757670 The planet is much closer to Gargantua<br />than we thought.
3757836 3760506 - Gargantua?<br />- It's what we're calling the black hole.
3760673 3762967 Miller's and Dr. Mann's<br />planets both orbit it.
3763133 3766345 - And Miller's is on the horizon?<br />- As a basketball around a hoop.
3766512 3768514 Landing there takes us dangerously close.
3768681 3771934 And a black hole that big<br />has a huge gravitational pull.
3774520 3777523 Look, I could swing around<br />that neutron star to decelerate.
3777690 3779566 No, it's not that. It's time.
3779733 3784238 The gravity on that planet will slow<br />our clock compared to Earth's drastically.
3784863 3786031 How bad?
3786198 3789743 Every hour we spend<br />on that planet will be...
3790619 3792788 seven years back on Earth.
3793664 3794707 Jesus.
3795040 3796709 Well, that's relativity, folks.
3798127 3800587 Well, we can't just drop down<br />there without...
3800754 3802631 Cooper, we have a mission.
3802798 3805384 Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,<br />and our mission Plan A is...
3805551 3808721 to find a planet that can habit ate<br />the people that are living on Earth now.
3808887 3811724 You can't just think about your family.<br />Now you have to think bigger.
3811890 3815102 I am thinking about my family<br />and millions of other families, okay?
3815269 3819523 Plan A does not work if the people on Earth<br />are dead by the time we pull it off.
3820816 3822484 No. It doesn't.
3822818 3824486 That's why there's a Plan B.
3826405 3827906 Okay. Cooper's right.
3828073 3831910 We need to think of time as a resource, like<br />oxygen and food. Going down will cost us.
3834288 3835456 All right, look.
3836749 3840210 Dr. Mann's data is promising,<br />but it will take months to get there.
3840377 3842588 And Edmunds', it's even further.
3842755 3846925 Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has is<br />very promising. It's water, it's organics...
3847092 3849261 - You don't find that every day.<br />- No, you don't.
3849428 3851764 And just think about the resources,<br />including time...
3851930 3854433 that would be spent<br />trying to get back here.
3855559 3857353 - Romilly...<br />- Yeah?
3857519 3861357 How far off from Miller's planet do we<br />have to be to stay out of the time shift?
3861523 3863192 Just back from the cusp.
3863359 3866320 All right, which is here,<br />just outside of Miller's planet.
3866487 3868280 - Right.<br />- Okay.
3869198 3871992 Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet.
3872159 3875329 Instead of taking the <i>Endurance</i> into orbit<br />around Miller's planet...
3875496 3878374 which would conserve fuel,<br />but we would lose a lot of time...
3878540 3882628 what if we take a wider orbit around<br />Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet...
3882795 3885297 outside of this time shift, to here?
3885464 3888258 Then we take the Ranger down,<br />we get Miller, we get her samples.
3888425 3891136 We come back, we analyze, we debrief.<br />We're in, we're out.
3891303 3893639 We lose a little fuel,<br />but we save a whole lot of time.
3893806 3895641 - That'll work.<br />- That's good.
3895808 3898268 There's no time for monkey business<br />or chit-chat down there.
3898435 3901230 So, TARS, you should definitely stay here.
3901397 3903649 CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay.
3903816 3907403 If we're talking about a couple years,<br />I could use the time to research gravity.
3907569 3910531 Observations from the wormhole,<br />that's gold to Professor Brand.
3910697 3912366 TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.
3912533 3917287 Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting, but make<br />sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.
3917454 3919998 - You got it?<br />- I wouldn't leave you behind...
3920165 3921208 Dr. Brand.
3925879 3927506 - You ready, CASE?<br />- Yup.
3928465 3931969 - You don't say much, do you?<br />- TARS talks plenty for both of us.
3933178 3934221 Detach.
3941520 3944481 - Romilly, are you reading these forces?<br /><i>- It's unbelievable.</i>
3947693 3949820 A literal heart of darkness.
3953991 3956702 If we could just see<br />the collapsed star inside...
3956869 3959621 the singularity,<br />yeah, we'd solve gravity.
3960038 3963333 - And we can't get anything from it?<br /><i>- Nothing escapes that horizon.</i>
3963500 3964835 Not even light.
3965002 3968505 <i>- The answer's there, just no way to see it.</i><br />- There's Miller's planet.
3971175 3972509 Goodbye, Ranger.
3985314 3987608 This is fast for atmospheric entry.
3987774 3990027 - Should we use the thrusters to slow?<br />- No.
3990486 3993822 I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics<br />to save some fuel.
3993989 3995199 Air brake?
3995365 3998911 - We want to get down fast, don't we?<br />- We want to get there in one piece.
3999077 4002080 - Hang on.<br />- Brand, Doyle, get ready.
4017930 4020432 - We should ease!<br />- Hands where I can see them.
4020599 4023936 The only time I went down was when a<br />machine was easing at the wrong time.
4024102 4026939 - A little caution...<br />- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.
4027105 4029274 - Cooper, it's too damn fast!<br />- I got this.
4034112 4038116 - Should I disable the feedback?<br />- No. I need to feel the air.
4042120 4043288 Here we go.
4046583 4047876 It's just water!
4049378 4050879 The stuff of life.
4051338 4052756 Twelve hundred meters.
4052923 4054967 - Do we have a fix on the beacon?<br />- Got it!
4055133 4057761 - Can you maneuver?<br />- I'll need to shave some speed.
4057928 4060556 I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.<br />Everybody hang on!
4062975 4064017 Seven hundred.
4066144 4068146 On my cue, CASE. On my cue.
4071650 4073151 Five hundred meters.
4082619 4083662 Fire!
4097217 4098302 Very graceful.
4098468 4099553 No.
4100178 4102264 But very efficient.
4104725 4106935 What are you waiting for? Let's go!
4107102 4109021 Go, go, go!
4109438 4112691 Seven years per hour here.<br />Let's make it count!
4138800 4140052 This way.
4142888 4144640 About 200 meters.
4154149 4155776 The gravity's punishing.
4156735 4158862 Been floating through space too long?
4159029 4161073 One hundred and thirty percent<br />Earth gravity.
4161406 4163408 Come on. Come on.
4166036 4168872 - There's nothing here.<br />- Should be right here.
4170791 4173794 If the signal's coming from here, then...
4183428 4184596 Her beacon.
4192729 4193772 Wreckage.
4194439 4195607 <i>Where's the rest?</i>
4196108 4197609 Towards the mountains!
4201446 4203281 Those aren't mountains.
4204950 4206284 They're waves.
4211623 4214292 Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
4214793 4216795 <i>That one's moving away from us.</i>
4223301 4224970 We need the recorder.
4235147 4237399 Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!
4237566 4240944 We're not leaving without her data.
4241111 4242446 Get back here now!
4242612 4244322 <i>We do not have time!</i>
4244489 4246950 The second wave is coming!<br />We're in the middle of a swell.
4248243 4249661 No, I got it.
4249828 4251830 Get your ass back to the Ranger now!
4256835 4258879 Brand, get back here now!
4260839 4263049 No, Cooper, go. Cooper,<br />go. I can't make it.
4263467 4265844 <i>- Go!</i><br />- CASE, go get her.
4270640 4272642 - Go!<br />- Get up. Get up, Brand!
4273560 4275061 Go, go! Go!
4276646 4279483 - I'm not gonna make it!<br />- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!
4286323 4288617 Come on, CASE has her!<br />Get back here, Doyle!
4291620 4292704 Come on!
4295457 4296875 Get to the hatch!
4301421 4302923 Go, go! Go!
4308470 4309554 Shit.
4310055 4311890 Manually overriding inside hatch!
4315393 4316561 Cooper! Wait!
4323902 4327572 The engines are flooded!<br />I'm gonna have to shut her down.
4361022 4362357 Holy shit.
4366778 4368113 Hang on!
4399352 4400604 CASE, what's the problem?
4400770 4403189 Too waterlogged. Let it drain.
4404316 4405525 Goddamn it!
4405692 4410363 - I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?<br />- And I told you to get your ass back here!
4410530 4415201 - One of us was thinking about the mission!<br />- You were thinking about getting home.
4417037 4419372 I was trying to do the right thing!
4419539 4421499 Can you tell that to Doyle?
4423793 4425962 - CASE, how much time?<br />- Forty-five to an hour.
4427756 4429090 The stuff of life, huh?
4430008 4432177 What's this gonna cost us, Brand?
4432344 4434304 A lot. Decades.
4441519 4442854 What happened to Miller?
4443605 4446358 Judging by the wreckage, she was...
4446524 4449152 broken up by a wave soon after impact.
4449319 4452155 How's the wreckage stayed together<br />after all these years, huh?
4453406 4455408 Because of the time slippage.
4456534 4461039 On this planet's time,<br />she just landed hours ago.
4461957 4464334 She probably just died minutes ago.
4464501 4468546 The data Doyle received was just<br />the initial status echoing endlessly.
4468922 4471091 Oh, we are not prepared for this.
4473468 4476930 You eggheads have the survival skills<br />of a Boy Scout troop.
4477097 4480350 Well, we got this far on our brains.<br />Farther than any human in history.
4480517 4482102 Well, not far enough!
4482435 4485939 And now we're stuck here till there<br />won't be anyone left on Earth to save.
4488984 4491653 I'm counting every minute,<br />same as you, Cooper.
4496449 4498284 Is there any possibility...
4498451 4502080 some kind of a way<br />we can maybe all jump in a black hole?
4502247 4503915 Gain back the years?
4504582 4506084 Don't shake your head at me.
4506251 4508253 Time is relative, okay?
4508420 4511464 It can stretch and it can squeeze, but...
4511965 4514175 it can't run backwards. It just can't.
4514342 4518763 The only thing that can move across<br />dimensions, like time, is gravity.
4521474 4522642 Okay.
4524602 4528481 The beings that led us here,<br />they communicate...
4528648 4530483 - through gravity, right?<br />- Yes.
4530650 4532819 Could they be talking<br />to us from the future?
4533737 4535989 - Maybe.<br />- Okay. If they can...
4537198 4540452 "They" are beings of five dimensions.
4540869 4544205 To them, time might be<br />another physical dimension.
4544539 4545874 To them...
4546291 4550462 the past might be a canyon<br />that they can climb into and the future...
4550628 4553631 a mountain they can climb up.<br />But to us, it's not, okay?
4554716 4557135 Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry.
4559304 4561056 But you knew about relativity.
4561222 4562557 Oh.
4564267 4565435 Brand...
4570315 4572233 my daughter was 10 years old.
4572859 4575653 I couldn't teach her<br />Einstein's theories before I left.
4576071 4578907 Couldn't you have told her<br />you were going to save the world?
4579491 4580533 No.
4582202 4586372 When you become a parent,<br />one thing becomes really clear.
4587874 4591044 And that is that you want to make sure<br />your children feel safe.
4592087 4595840 And it rules out telling a 10-year-old<br />that the world is ending.
4598301 4599677 Cooper?
4603389 4605892 - How long for the engines, CASE?<br />- A minute or two.
4606059 4608144 We don't have it. Helmets on!
4612065 4613858 Brand, co-pilot, you're up.
4614025 4616528 CASE, blow the cabin oxygen<br />through the main thrusters!
4616694 4618404 - We're gonna spark it.<br />- Roger that.
4618696 4620031 - Locked.<br />- Depressurizing.
4625912 4627163 Engines up!
4656025 4657527 Hello, Rom.
4657986 4659654 I've waited years.
4660738 4662574 How...? How many years?
4664409 4667370 - By now it must be...<br />- Twenty-three years...
4667537 4669247 four months, eight days.
4673668 4674836 Doyle?
4681050 4684053 I thought I was prepared.<br />I knew the theory.
4685430 4686931 Reality's different.
4687974 4689142 And Miller?
4690727 4692729 There's nothing here for us.
4695481 4696983 Why didn't you sleep?
4697942 4702030 Oh, I had a couple of stretches. But I<br />stopped believing you were coming back.
4702530 4705533 And something seemed wrong<br />about dreaming my life away.
4706367 4709204 I learned what I could<br />from the black hole...
4709579 4712040 but I couldn't send<br />anything to your father.
4712207 4714459 We've been receiving, but nothing gets out.
4714626 4716711 - Is he alive?<br />- Oh, yeah.
4717128 4718922 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah.
4721925 4724928 We've got years of messages stored.
4725220 4726387 Cooper.
4726554 4729557 <i>Messages span 23 years.</i>
4731601 4733269 Play it from the beginning.
4736314 4738024 <i>Hey, Dad.</i>
4738858 4741277 <i>Checking in. Saying hi.</i>
4742362 4743863 <i>Um...</i>
4744030 4745823 <i>Finished second in school.</i>
4747408 4749827 <i>Miss Kurling's still giving me C's though.</i>
4750119 4752956 <i>Pulled me down, but second's not bad.</i>
4754123 4756292 <i>Grandpa attended the ceremony.</i>
4757919 4759921 <i>Um... Oh.</i>
4760880 4762840 <i>I met another girl, Dad.</i>
4763007 4764592 <i>I, uh...</i>
4765343 4767345 <i>I really think this is the one.</i>
4768638 4771224 <i>Name's Lois. That's her right there.</i>
4774269 4776271 <i>Murphy stole Grandpa's car.</i>
4776938 4779607 <i>She crashed it. She's okay, though.</i>
4780275 4781359 <i>Hey, Dad.</i>
4782277 4783611 <i>Look at this!</i>
4784445 4785947 <i>You're a grandpa.</i>
4787365 4789033 <i>His name's Jesse.</i>
4789701 4794289 <i>I kind of wanted to call him Coop,<br />but Lois says, uh, maybe next time.</i>
4794956 4799377 <i>Donald says he's already earned the<br />"great" part, so we just leave it at that.</i>
4802547 4804340 <i>Oh, dear. Oh, dear.</i>
4805133 4806759 <i>Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."</i>
4807135 4808970 <i>Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.</i>
4809387 4811889 <i>Sorry it's been a while.</i>
4813266 4814309 <i>Just...</i>
4816519 4818521 <i>what with Jesse and all.</i>
4821899 4823401 <i>Uh...</i>
4825028 4827363 <i>Grandpa died last week.</i>
4827780 4830867 <i>We buried him out in the back forty<br />next to Mom and...</i>
4831743 4832827 <i>Jesse.</i>
4833703 4836789 <i>Which is where we would have buried you<br />if you'd ever...</i>
4837540 4839042 <i>come back.</i>
4840543 4842795 <i>Murph was there at the funeral.</i>
4843421 4846174 <i>We don't see her that much,<br />but she came for that.</i>
4849385 4851804 <i>You aren't listening to this, I know that.</i>
4854932 4857685 <i>All these messages are just, like...</i>
4858853 4862523 <i>drifting out there in the darkness.</i>
4863608 4865943 <i>Lois says that, uh...</i>
4866736 4869489 <i>I have to let you go.</i>
4869864 4871699 <i>And, uh...</i>
4872200 4873284 <i>so...</i>
4876537 4879624 <i>I guess I'm letting you go.</i>
4880583 4883252 <i>I don't know where you are, Dad...</i>
4883878 4886506 <i>but I hope that you're at peace.</i>
4888299 4889384 <i>Goodbye.</i>
4902980 4904232 <i>Hey, Dad.</i>
4907068 4908236 Hey, Murph.
4908403 4910321 <i>You son of a bitch.</i>
4914033 4916536 <i>I never made one of these<br />when you were still responding...</i>
4916702 4919038 <i>because I was so mad at you for leaving.</i>
4922083 4924168 <i>And then when you went quiet, it...</i>
4926796 4929632 <i>seemed like I should live<br />with that decision. And I have.</i>
4934137 4936556 <i>But today's my birthday.</i>
4940226 4943396 <i>And it's a special one,<br />because you told me...</i>
4947525 4951863 <i>You once told me that when you came back,<br />we might be the same age.</i>
4953573 4956659 <i>And today I'm the age you were<br />when you left.</i>
4959662 4961747 <i>So it would be a real good time<br />for you to come back.</i>
4976220 4980516 I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that<br />I've never seen you in here before.
4981142 4983311 I've never been in here before.
4985188 4988191 I talk to Amelia all the time.
4988691 4990026 It helps.
4990693 4993446 - I'm glad you've started.<br />- I haven't. I...
4993613 4996115 I just had something I needed to get out.
4996449 4998868 - I know they're still out there.<br />- I know.
4999035 5003247 There are so many reasons their<br />communications might not be getting through.
5003414 5004832 I know, professor.
5005458 5008377 I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.
5009545 5011881 Them never coming back or...
5013090 5016302 coming back to find we've failed.
5016469 5017887 Then let's succeed.
5018930 5019972 So...
5020681 5024685 back to the fourth iteration.<br />Let's run it through some new fields.
5025019 5028189 With respect, professor,<br />we've tried that hundreds of times.
5028523 5032193 It only has to work once, Murph.
5035488 5039367 Every rivet that they strike<br />could have been a bullet.
5039534 5041536 We've done well for the world here...
5041702 5046457 whether or not we crack the equation<br />before I kick the bucket.
5046624 5049502 - Don't be morbid, professor.<br />- I'm not afraid of death.
5050253 5052088 I'm an old physicist.
5053339 5055007 I'm afraid of time.
5062181 5063349 Time.
5065393 5067061 You're afraid of time.
5069647 5071649 We've been trying to solve the equation...
5071816 5074318 without changing<br />the underlying assumption about time.
5074485 5076195 - And?<br />- And that means...
5076362 5080825 each iteration is an attempt<br />to prove its own proof.
5080992 5083119 It's recursive. It's nonsensical.
5083411 5085329 Are you calling my life's work...
5085496 5087206 nonsense, Murph?
5087373 5089417 No, I'm saying that<br />you've been trying to...
5089584 5093379 finish it with one arm... No, with<br />both arms... Tied behind your back.
5095464 5097466 And I don't understand why.
5098426 5100261 I'm an old man, Murph.
5101178 5103806 Can we take this point up at another time?
5103973 5106100 I want to talk to my daughter.
5108269 5110730 <i>Stepping out into the universe...</i>
5110896 5114692 <i>we must confront the reality<br />of interstellar travel.</i>
5115610 5120156 <i>We must reach far beyond<br />our own lifespans.</i>
5120323 5125453 <i>We must think not as individuals<br />but as a species.</i>
5128289 5130916 <i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>
5133085 5135671 TARS kept the <i>Endurance</i><br />right where we needed her.
5135838 5138633 But the trip took years longer<br />than we anticipated.
5138966 5142470 We no longer have the fuel<br />to visit both prospects, so...
5142803 5144305 we have to choose.
5145514 5146641 But how?
5147683 5149352 They're both promising.
5150895 5155399 Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann<br />is the one still transmitting, so...
5155566 5158486 We've no reason to suspect<br />Edmunds's data would have soured.
5159403 5161906 His world has key elements<br />to sustain human life.
5162073 5165242 - As does Dr. Mann's.<br />- Cooper, this is my field.
5166410 5167453 And...
5168245 5170414 I really believe Edmunds'<br />is the better prospect.
5170581 5173918 - Why?<br />- Gargantua, that's why.
5175044 5179090 Look at Miller's planet.<br />Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...
5179256 5183678 but no life. Sterile.<br />We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
5184095 5185763 Because of the black hole?
5186055 5189100 Murphy's Law.<br />Whatever can happen will happen.
5189266 5191602 Accident is the first building block<br />of evolution.
5191769 5194605 But when you're orbiting a black hole<br />not enough can happen.
5194772 5199068 It sucks in asteroids and comets, other<br />events which would otherwise reach you.
5199443 5201278 We need to go further afield.
5201904 5204240 You once said that Dr. Mann...
5205491 5206992 was the best of us.
5207284 5210454 He's remarkable.<br />We're only here because of him.
5210996 5212832 And yet... Yet here he is.
5212998 5217962 He's on the ground, and he's sending<br />a very unambiguous message, telling us...
5218129 5219839 to come to his planet.
5220005 5224635 Granted, but Edmunds' data<br />is more promising.
5225094 5226137 We should vote.
5226303 5228472 Well, if we vote,<br />there's something you should know.
5229598 5230641 Brand?
5230808 5232476 He has a right to know.
5232977 5234729 That has nothing to do with it.
5234895 5237940 - What does?<br />- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.
5238107 5240651 - Is that true?<br />- Yes.
5243821 5246532 And that makes me want to follow my heart.
5249994 5253664 But maybe we've spent too long<br />trying to figure all this out with theory.
5253831 5255249 You're a scientist, Brand.
5255416 5256959 So listen to me...
5257793 5262506 when I say that love<br />isn't something we invented. It's...
5263507 5265843 observable, powerful.
5267928 5269638 It has to mean something.
5269805 5274185 Love has meaning, yes. Social<br />utility, social bonding, child rearing...
5274351 5277855 We love people who have died.<br />Where's the social utility in that?
5278397 5279440 None.
5279607 5283486 Maybe it means something more,<br />something we can't...
5283652 5285696 yet understand.
5285863 5289325 Maybe it's some evidence, some...
5290284 5294747 artifact of a higher dimension<br />that we can't consciously perceive.
5294914 5299710 I'm drawn across the universe<br />to someone I haven't seen in a decade...
5299877 5302713 who I know is probably dead.
5303047 5306383 Love is the one thing<br />we're capable of perceiving...
5306550 5309386 that transcends dimensions<br />of time and space.
5311222 5315559 Maybe we should trust that,<br />even if we can't understand it yet.
5320564 5322233 All right, Cooper...
5324109 5325402 yes...
5326570 5329907 the tiniest possibility<br />of seeing Wolf again excites me.
5330741 5332409 That doesn't mean I'm wrong.
5333118 5335287 Honestly, Amelia...
5337081 5338249 it might.
5345047 5347758 TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.
5364650 5366110 We'll lose about a third again.
5366277 5367820 But next year...
5370114 5372950 Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm<br />and we'll make it up.
5373784 5375619 What happened to Nelson?
5381542 5383752 <i>Murph, would you like some more soufflė?</i>
5383919 5387298 Oh, no. I'm full, thanks. It was delicious.
5388173 5390175 Coop, finish your fritter, please.
5392344 5396056 Will you spend the night? Your<br />room is exactly as you left it. It's ready.
5396223 5397600 I need to get back.
5397766 5400311 My sewing machine is in there,<br />but there's plenty...
5400477 5401770 I need to...
5404648 5406191 Too many memories.
5406817 5409612 We might have something for that.<br />Hey, Coop.
5417161 5418454 The dust.
5420956 5423334 Lois, I have a friend who...
5423500 5425336 could look at his lungs.
5443520 5446190 - Amelia, I'm sorry.<br />- You were just being objective.
5446357 5449818 Unless you're punishing me<br />for screwing up on Miller's planet.
5449985 5452237 No, this wasn't a personal decision.
5453072 5457117 If you're wrong, you will have<br />a very personal decision to make.
5457284 5460245 Your fuel calculations<br />are based on a return journey.
5460579 5464458 Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have<br />to decide whether to return home...
5464750 5466877 or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.
5467211 5470881 Starting a colony could save us<br />from extinction.
5471215 5474385 You might have to decide<br />between seeing your children again...
5474551 5476387 and the future of the human race.
5477888 5479598 I trust you'll be as objective then.
5486480 5488399 He's been asking for you since he came to.
5488565 5490192 We were trying to reach you.
5496156 5497199 Murph.
5498200 5499702 I'm here, professor.
5500411 5502746 I let you all down.
5503080 5506417 No, you got us so far. Real close.
5508252 5510045 I'll finish what you started.
5510212 5512423 Good, good Murph.
5514717 5517011 You had faith...
5518220 5519513 all those...
5520472 5522266 all those years.
5523934 5525185 I...
5525352 5527855 I asked you to have faith.
5529606 5532401 I wanted you to believe...
5533902 5535779 that your father...
5538782 5540617 would come back.
5540784 5542077 I do, professor.
5543704 5545205 Forgive me, Murph.
5545956 5547958 There's nothing to forgive.
5550627 5551670 I...
5552254 5554089 I lied, Murph.
5556467 5558260 I lied to you.
5564600 5567811 There was no need for him to...
5569021 5570898 To come back.
5573484 5576820 There is no way to help us.
5578113 5579156 But Plan A...
5579698 5582826 All this. All these people.
5583952 5585746 And the equation.
5589750 5591502 Did my father know?
5595297 5597007 Did he leave me?
5600969 5602012 Do...
5603180 5604515 not...
5605474 5606725 go...
5607935 5609520 gentle...
5611522 5612689 No.
5614358 5615442 No!
5616652 5618320 You can't leave.
5618695 5619947 You... No.
5621031 5625702 <i>Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that<br />your father died today. He had no pain.</i>
5626286 5627955 He was at peace.
5628622 5630707 I'm very sorry for your loss.
5643303 5644972 Brand, did you know?
5647391 5649059 <i>He told you, right?</i>
5651937 5653313 <i>You knew.</i>
5655232 5657025 <i>This was all a sham.</i>
5661405 5663490 <i>You left us here.</i>
5665242 5666743 <i>To suffocate.</i>
5668912 5670247 <i>To starve.</i>
5697608 5698942 Frozen cloud.
5843378 5844755 It's okay.
5844921 5846340 It's okay.
5853180 5854681 It's okay.
5860103 5862105 Pray you never learn...
5863273 5866610 just how good it can be<br />to see another face.
5875035 5877537 I hadn't a lot of hope<br />to begin with, but...
5877704 5880040 after so long, I had none.
5881708 5884544 My supplies were completely exhausted.
5886505 5890258 The last time I went to sleep,<br />I didn't even set a waking date.
5893970 5896556 You have literally raised me from the dead.
5897599 5899768 - Lazarus.<br />- Hm.
5900685 5903939 - What about the others?<br />- I'm afraid you're it, sir.
5904648 5907067 So far, surely.
5907818 5912656 No, our present situation is that there's<br />very little chance of rescuing any others.
5916410 5918620 Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?
5919496 5921289 Tell us about your world.
5924668 5926545 Our world, we hope.
5930340 5932676 Our world, uh, is cold...
5932843 5934136 stark...
5936012 5937848 but undeniably beautiful.
5940100 5943353 <i>The days are 67 hours long, cold.</i>
5947357 5949109 <i>The nights are...</i>
5949276 5951611 <i>67 far colder hours.</i>
5957451 5961788 <i>The gravity is a very, very pleasant<br />80 percent of the Earth's.</i>
5961955 5964958 Now, up here where I landed,<br />the water is alkali...
5965292 5969045 and the air has too much ammonia to<br />breathe for more than just a few minutes...
5969212 5973800 but down at the surface,<br />and there is a surface...
5973967 5975594 the chlorine dissipates.
5975760 5979639 The ammonia gives way to crystalline<br />hydrocarbons and breathable air.
5979973 5981475 To organics.
5981808 5984144 Possibly even to life.
5984978 5986897 We might be sharing this world.
5987439 5989399 These readings are from the surface?
5989566 5992736 Over the years, I've<br />dropped various probes.
5993069 5996490 - How far have you explored?<br />- I've mounted several major expeditions.
5996656 6000911 But with oxygen in limited supply,<br />KIPP there really did most of the legwork.
6001077 6003538 - What went wrong with him, sir?<br />- Degeneration.
6003705 6007292 He misidentified the first organics<br />we found as ammonia crystals.
6007459 6011588 We struggled on for a time,<br />but ultimately I decommissioned him and...
6011755 6013924 used his power source<br />to keep the mission going.
6014090 6017093 I thought I was alone<br />before I shut him down.
6017260 6018929 Would you like me to look at him?
6019429 6021598 No. No. He needs a human touch.
6021765 6026269 Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message<br />for you from the comm station.
6026436 6028897 Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.
6040909 6043495 <i>Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you<br />that your father died today.</i>
6044204 6045830 <i>He had no pain.</i>
6048959 6050460 <i>He was at peace.</i>
6052546 6054381 <i>I'm sorry for your loss.</i>
6056758 6057801 Is that Murph?
6058510 6060971 She's... She's grown.
6061137 6062722 <i>Brand, did you know?</i>
6063890 6065559 <i>He told you, right?</i>
6068603 6069896 <i>You knew.</i>
6071648 6073149 <i>This was all a sham.</i>
6074192 6075860 <i>You left us here.</i>
6077988 6079489 <i>To suffocate.</i>
6081575 6082951 <i>To starve.</i>
6086288 6087872 <i>Did my father know too?</i>
6090458 6091918 <i>Dad?</i>
6093670 6095589 <i>I just want to know...</i>
6096923 6098925 <i>if you left me here to die.</i>
6101511 6103513 <i>I just have to know.</i>
6109019 6110437 Cooper, my...
6111938 6113857 My father dedicated...
6114232 6119237 his whole life to Plan A.<br />I have no idea what she's talking about.
6120947 6122115 I do.
6127245 6129914 He never even hoped<br />to get the people off the Earth?
6131124 6132334 No.
6136379 6140216 But he's been trying to solve<br />the gravity equation for 40 years.
6140717 6144137 Amelia, your father solved his equation<br />before I even left.
6144721 6146598 Then why wouldn't he use it?
6146765 6150727 The equation couldn't reconcile relativity<br />with quantum mechanics. You need more.
6150894 6152812 More? More what?
6152979 6155982 More data. You need<br />to see into a black hole.
6156149 6158234 The laws of nature prohibit<br />a naked singularity.
6158401 6159903 Romilly, is that true?
6161196 6164908 If a black hole is an oyster,<br />then the singularity's the pearl inside.
6165075 6167827 The gravity's so strong,<br />it's always hidden in darkness...
6167994 6169412 behind the horizon.
6170830 6172916 That's why we call it a black hole.
6173083 6176503 Okay, but if we see beyond the horizon...
6177087 6178588 We can't, Coop.
6178755 6181257 There are some things<br />that aren't meant to be known.
6181591 6185637 Your father had to find another way<br />to save the human race from extinction.
6185804 6187305 Plan B. A colony.
6187472 6189140 Why not tell people?
6190725 6193812 - Why keep building those stations?<br />- He knew how hard it would be...
6193978 6198108 to get people to work together<br />to save the species instead of themselves.
6198274 6199442 Or their children.
6199609 6200652 Bullshit.
6200819 6203613 You never would've come<br />unless you believed you would save them.
6203780 6206991 Evolution has yet to transcend<br />that simple barrier.
6207158 6209619 We can care deeply, selflessly about...
6209786 6213289 those we know, but that empathy<br />rarely extends beyond our line of sight.
6213456 6215166 But the lie.
6218461 6220880 That monstrous lie?
6222132 6223425 Unforgivable.
6223591 6225051 And he knew that.
6225802 6230140 He was prepared to destroy his own humanity<br />in order to save the species.
6230306 6232726 - He made an incredible sacrifice.<br />- No.
6234144 6239023 An incredible sacrifice is being made<br />by the people on Earth who are gonna die!
6239482 6241651 Because in his fucking arrogance...
6242068 6244154 he declared their case hopeless.
6244821 6246322 I'm sorry, Cooper...
6246865 6248324 their case is hopeless.
6248491 6250618 No. No.
6251244 6252746 We are the future.
6256416 6258334 Cooper, what can I do?
6261546 6263381 Let me go home.
6263965 6265884 You're absolutely positive?
6266509 6269012 His solution was correct.<br />He'd had it for years.
6269679 6272307 - It's worthless?<br />- It's half the answer.
6273266 6276269 Okay, how do you find the other half?
6276853 6278521 Out there? A black hole.
6278688 6281524 - But stuck down here on Earth?<br />- Yeah?
6282859 6284527 I'm not sure you can.
6286446 6289115 God, they just pack up and leave.
6290533 6292619 What are they hoping to find?
6293203 6294245 Survival.
6302045 6303129 Damn it.
6306049 6309844 Murph, don't...?<br />Don't people have a right to know?
6310470 6314557 Panic won't help.<br />We just have to keep working, same as ever.
6314724 6318061 But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand<br />was manipulating us to do?
6318228 6321481 Brand gave up on us.<br />I'm still trying to solve this.
6322106 6323191 So...
6324609 6326277 do you have an idea?
6326986 6328321 A feeling.
6331741 6333743 <i>I told you about my ghost.</i>
6335745 6337789 <i>My dad thought I called it a ghost...</i>
6338248 6339916 because I was scared of it.
6343378 6344712 But I was never scared of it.
6346923 6349592 <i>I called it a ghost because it felt...</i>
6352011 6353680 It felt like a person.
6356224 6357892 It was trying to tell me something.
6360854 6363857 If there's an answer here on Earth,<br />it's back there...
6364315 6366234 somehow, in that room.
6366776 6368528 So I have to find it.
6371948 6373700 We're running out of time.
6375618 6377620 <i>What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?</i>
6377787 6379956 No, they can stay.<br />I'll be sleeping anyway.
6380123 6381708 - Hey, Coop?<br />- Yeah?
6381875 6383877 I have a suggestion<br />for your return journey.
6384043 6386796 - Yeah, what's that?<br />- Have one last crack at the black hole.
6388673 6390258 I'm going home, Rom.
6390425 6393678 Yeah, I know.<br />This isn't going to cost you any time.
6394429 6396264 There's a chance for the people on Earth.
6397015 6400059 - Talk to me.<br />- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.
6400226 6404105 - It's what we call a gentle singularity.<br />- Gentle?
6404272 6407734 They're hardly gentle.<br />But the tidal gravity is so quick that...
6407901 6412155 something crossing the horizon fast<br />might survive. A probe, say.
6412322 6416993 - What happens after it crosses?<br />- After the horizon is a complete mystery.
6417160 6420246 So, what's to say<br />there isn't some way that the probe...
6420413 6423333 can glimpse the singularity<br />and relay the quantum data?
6423499 6426753 If he's equipped to transmit<br />every form of energy that can pulse.
6426920 6429714 Just when did this probe<br />become a "he," professor?
6430256 6432008 TARS is the obvious candidate.
6432842 6434761 I've already told him what to look for.
6434928 6437639 I'd need the old optical transmitter<br />off KIPP, Cooper.
6437805 6439140 You'd do this for us?
6439307 6443227 Before you get all teary, remember that<br />as a robot I have to do anything you say.
6444145 6445605 Your cue light's broken.
6445772 6447315 I'm not joking.
6449943 6453196 I'll need TARS to remove and adapt<br />some components from KIPP.
6453363 6455698 I don't want to disturb<br />his archival functions.
6455865 6457367 I'll supervise.
6457700 6458743 All right.
6458910 6463581 Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure<br />sites. One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.
6463748 6466209 Once those modules have landed,<br />you don't want to move them.
6466376 6468920 I can take you to the probe sites,<br />but I don't think...
6469087 6471798 these conditions will hold.<br />I think we should wait.
6471965 6474801 CASE is headed down<br />with the rest of the distillery equipment.
6474968 6477804 I'd really like to secure<br />those sites by nightfall.
6479722 6482809 Well, these squalls do usually blow over.
6483226 6484352 Okay, then.
6484519 6486729 - You'll need a long-range transmitter.<br />- Got it.
6486896 6488439 - Are you charged?<br />- Yeah.
6489023 6490066 Follow me.
6490858 6493027 TARS, 72 hours, yeah?
6493194 6494404 Roger that, Cooper.
6500702 6503746 Brand told me why you feel<br />you have to go back.
6505581 6508334 But I'd be remiss<br />if I didn't at least mention...
6508668 6512839 that a mission such as ours<br />could certainly use an extra engineer.
6514674 6518928 You better slow down, turbo.<br />Safety first, CASE, remember.
6519554 6521305 <i>Safety first, Cooper.</i>
6522557 6525560 I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,<br />I'm honored to be a part of this.
6525935 6530940 But once we set up base camp and secure<br />those modules, my work's done here.
6531357 6532692 I'm going home.
6540700 6544203 You have attachments.<br />But even without a family...
6544620 6549083 I can promise you that that yearning<br />to be with other people is powerful.
6549751 6553087 That emotion is at the foundation...
6553755 6556799 of what makes us human.<br />It's not to be taken lightly.
6564807 6567393 - How long have you had that cough?<br />- A while.
6577945 6579864 Mom lets me play in here.
6581783 6583034 I don't touch your stuff.
6614023 6615650 Just take this gently.
6620780 6624158 You know why we couldn't just send machines<br />on these missions, don't you?
6624784 6629413 A machine doesn't improvise well<br />because you can't program a fear of death.
6630289 6632625 Our survival instinct<br />is our single greatest...
6632792 6636337 source of inspiration.<br />Take you, for example.
6637046 6638381 A father...
6638881 6641884 with a survival instinct<br />that extends to your kids.
6643052 6647723 What does research tell us is the last<br />thing you're going to see before you die?
6649433 6651894 Your children. Their faces.
6652228 6654814 At the moment of death,<br />your mind's gonna push...
6654981 6656691 a little bit harder to survive.
6657400 6658442 For them.
6659318 6660570 Deep breath.
6662864 6666617 Uh, hey. I bet you're Coop.<br />Why don't you have a seat here for me?
6666909 6669245 It's bad. They cannot stay here.
6669954 6671247 - Okay?<br />- Yeah.
6679589 6681048 TARS, what's taking so long?
6681215 6684093 Professor, I am having trouble<br />completing the boot up.
6684260 6685803 I don't understand.
6692602 6693853 It's funny.
6695938 6697565 When I left Earth...
6698566 6700651 I thought I was prepared to die.
6702695 6704030 The truth is...
6706240 6711245 I never really considered the<br />possibility that my planet wasn't the one.
6713956 6716292 Nothing worked out the way<br />it was supposed to.
6716459 6717501 Let's go.
6725968 6728763 All right, buddy, give<br />me a big deep breath.
6733559 6734977 What is this?
6735394 6739232 - What are you doing?<br />- I'm sorry! I can't let you leave with that ship.
6739565 6741901 We're gonna need it<br />to complete the mission...
6742235 6745655 once the others realize<br />what this place isn't.
6745947 6748699 We cannot survive here. I'm sorry!
6749158 6750201 I'm sorry!
6759961 6763089 - They can't stay here anymore.<br />- You have to leave right now.
6763256 6766801 Let me make something abundantly clear.<br />You have a responsibility...
6766968 6770096 - Oh! Jesus!<br />- Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.
6770429 6772348 Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb, Tom!
6772515 6776602 Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did. And<br />he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.
6777186 6779855 You faked all the data?
6781565 6782650 Yeah.
6786654 6788364 There's no surface?
6788531 6789699 No.
6790658 6792660 I tried to do my duty, Cooper...
6792827 6797832 but I knew the day that I arrived here<br />that this place had nothing.
6798457 6802253 And I resisted the temptation for years...
6802878 6804964 but I knew that...
6805298 6808134 if I just pressed that button, then...
6808426 6810428 somebody would come and save me.
6811470 6812972 You fucking coward.
6813806 6814849 Yes.
6820271 6821314 Yes.
6823232 6824275 Yes.
6825526 6826569 Yes.
6838080 6842626 Listen, if you're not going to go,<br />let your family go. Just save your family.
6843127 6845421 And we go live underground with you?
6845588 6847506 Pray that Daddy comes to save us?
6847673 6851177 Dad's not coming back.<br />He never was coming back. It's up to me.
6851344 6853220 You're gonna save everybody?
6853596 6856432 - Because Dad couldn't do it.<br />- Dad didn't even try!
6856599 6858768 Dad just abandoned us!
6859518 6861312 He left us here to die.
6862021 6863689 Nobody's going with you.
6867401 6870112 You gonna wait for your next kid to die?
6873115 6874408 Get out.
6875284 6876619 And don't come back.
6881499 6883334 You can keep my stuff.
6894261 6895638 Stop it!
6898641 6900226 No. No!
6901310 6904188 Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance<br />you're gonna kill yourself!
6905022 6907024 Those are the best odds I've had in years.
6927461 6929296 Don't judge me, Cooper.
6930047 6932299 You were never tested like I was.
6932925 6934385 Few men have been.
6942726 6943894 You tried your best, Murph.
6953404 6954780 You're feeling it, aren't you?
6956449 6958284 The survival instinct.
6959201 6963539 That's what drove me. It's what drives<br />all of us. And it's what's gonna save us.
6964707 6968043 Because I want to save all of us.<br />For you, Cooper.
6973215 6976760 I'm sorry, I can't watch you<br />go through this. I'm sorry.
6977094 6979763 I thought I could, but I can't.
6980848 6983017 I'm here. I'm here for you.
6983309 6985352 <i>Just listen to my voice, Cooper.</i>
6986145 6987480 <i>I'm right here.</i>
6989315 6990649 <i>You're not alone.</i>
7000367 7001869 Do you see your children?
7005122 7006457 <i>It's okay.</i>
7007416 7009168 They're right there with you.
7013047 7015633 Did Professor Brand tell you<br />that poem before you left?
7016467 7017968 <i>Do you remember?</i>
7020346 7023015 <i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>
7024934 7027728 <i>Old age should burn and rave</i>
7027895 7029480 <i>At close of day</i>
7031065 7033442 <i>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</i>
7058092 7059760 Brand! Help!
7059927 7061887 <i>- Help!</i><br />- Cooper?
7068602 7069812 CASE!
7070187 7071480 No air.
7072314 7073524 Ammonia.
7074608 7077111 Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE!
7077278 7079196 - I have a fix.<br />- Go! Go, go, go!
7079363 7081448 And away!
7093002 7095212 Cooper, we're coming.<br />Hang in there. Don't talk.
7095379 7097673 Try to breathe as little as possible.<br />We're almost there.
7101343 7103345 There's a security lockout, sir.
7103512 7106765 It requires a person to access function.
7111812 7113314 It's all yours, sir.
7121530 7122990 <i>Try not to breathe.</i>
7123991 7125659 <i>We're coming. We're coming right now.</i>

7128120 7130831 <i>We got to go faster, CASE!<br />Faster, faster, faster!</i>
7135336 7137046 Hang in there. Come on.
7143552 7146847 I see him, I see him!<br />CASE, bank! Bank right!
7165866 7167409 Cooper! Cooper!
7167785 7168869 I'm here!
7192101 7194103 This data makes no sense.
7202528 7203779 I'm sorry.
7204113 7206699 - What?<br />- Mann was lying!
7214456 7216250 Go. Go.
7217334 7218377 Romilly.
7218752 7219795 <i>Romilly!</i>
7220129 7222548 <i>Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly?</i>
7223132 7225134 Step back, professor! Step back!
7233058 7235644 <i>- Romilly...<br />- Romilly, do you read me?</i>
7238647 7239982 Keep watch!
7241150 7242276 Lois?
7242776 7245279 - What happened to caution, CASE?<br />- Safety first, Cooper.
7246655 7250075 Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?<br />This is Brand.
7252953 7253996 Romilly?
7254163 7256749 Dr. Brand. Cooper.<br />There's been an explosion.
7257374 7259168 Dr. Mann's compound.
7286779 7288822 TARS, TARS, 10 o'clock!
7295204 7297164 Let me know when TARS is aboard.
7300793 7302669 Romilly did not survive.
7303879 7305547 I could not save him.
7305714 7307174 - TARS is in.<br />- I'll take her now.
7307341 7310219 - Do we have a fix on the Ranger?<br />- He's pushing into orbit!
7310385 7313388 If he takes control of<br />that ship, we're dead.
7314598 7317559 - He'd maroon us?<br />- He is marooning us.
7319561 7322064 I'll meet you guys downstairs.<br />Go wait by the car.
7329905 7334117 Come on! Give me your bag. Get in<br />the backseat. Get in the backseat now!
7339748 7341667 <i>Dr. Mann, please respond.</i>
7342292 7344378 Dr. Mann, please respond!
7344545 7346755 He doesn't know<br />the <i>Endurance</i> docking procedure.
7346922 7349424 - The autopilot does.<br />- Not since TARS disabled it.
7350634 7351677 Nice.
7351844 7354763 <i>- What's your trust setting, TARS?</i><br />- Lower than yours apparently.

7567100 7569936 If you open the hatch,<br />the airlock will depressurize.
7595837 7598131 - What happens if he blows the airlock?<br />- Nothing good.
7604012 7606640 Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters,<br />everything we've got, CASE!
7606807 7608517 - Thrusters are full!<br />- Back!
7608683 7610685 Relay my transmission<br />to the on board computer...

7623865 7626535 but I am taking command<br />of the <i>Endurance.</i>
7626993 7629037 <i>And then we can talk<br />about completing the mission.</i>
7632499 7634209 Dr. Mann, listen to me.
7635001 7637003 This is not about my life.
7637629 7640882 Or Cooper's life. This<br />is about all mankind.
7641466 7642884 There is a moment...
7649224 7650559 It is not sa...
7658859 7659901 Oh, my God.
7678211 7682174 - There's no point using fuel to chase...<br />- Analyze the <i>Endurance's</i> spin.
7687429 7689639 - Cooper, what are you doing?<br />- Docking.
7694227 7697063 <i>Endurance</i> rotation is 67, 68 RPM.
7697230 7699691 Okay, get ready to match our spin<br />with the retro thrusters.
7699858 7701943 - It's not possible.<br />- No...
7702110 7703278 it's necessary.
7714915 7717083 <i>Endurance</i> is hitting stratosphere!

7839706 7841041 Easy.
7842208 7843543 Easy.
7849382 7850884 Retro thrusters!
7858850 7860352 Main engines on.
7866107 7868818 Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.
7876826 7878495 Killing main engines!
7879746 7881414 Okay, we're out of orbit.
7888755 7891633 Okay. And for our next trick!
7893468 7897305 It'll have to be good.<br />We're heading into Gargantua's pull.
7898223 7899265 Oh, shit.
7899766 7901559 - CASE, take the stick.<br />- Roger that.
7951526 7953862 <i>Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.</i>
7955196 7957157 <i>Shall I use main engines?</i>
7957323 7958366 No.
7958950 7961202 We got to let her slide as far as we can.
7970003 7972881 - Give it to me.<br />- There's good news, there's bad news.
7973047 7976676 Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS.<br />Give it to me straight.
7985518 7988730 The backup generator kicked in,<br />so the system's stable. They're all good.
7988897 7989939 Good.
7990356 7993693 Okay. The navigational hub<br />has been completely destroyed.
7993860 7996821 We don't have enough life support<br />to make it back to Earth...
7996988 7999073 but we can scratch our way<br />to Edmunds' planet.
7999240 8000575 What about fuel?
8000992 8003495 Not enough. But I have a plan.
8004120 8008124 <i>We let Gargantua pull us down<br />close to her horizon.</i>
8008625 8011878 <i>Then a powered slingshot around,<br />launching us towards Edmunds' planet.</i>
8012045 8014547 <i>- Manually?<br />- That's what I'm here for.</i>
8014714 8017425 <i>I'm gonna take us just<br />inside the critical orbit.</i>
8017592 8020112 <i>- What about time slippage?<br />- Neither of us has time to worry...</i>
8020261 8021930 about relativity right now, Dr. Brand.
8026559 8028061 I'm sorry, Cooper.
8031189 8034442 <i>Once we've gathered<br />enough speed around Gargantua...</i>
8034776 8036611 <i>we use Lander 1...</i>
8037111 8039405 <i>and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...</i>
8040573 8042575 <i>push us out of the black hole's gravity.</i>
8044911 8047580 <i>The Lander's linkages<br />have been destroyed...</i>
8047747 8050083 <i>so we'll have to control manually.</i>
8051292 8054754 <i>Once Lander 1 is spent, TARS will detach...</i>
8054921 8056631 And get sucked into that black hole.
8057257 8059217 Why does TARS have to detach?
8059384 8061427 We have to shed the weight<br />to escape the gravity.
8061594 8062971 <i>Newton's third law.</i>
8063137 8065848 <i>The only way humans have ever<br />figured out of getting somewhere...</i>
8066015 8067559 <i>is to leave something behind.</i>
8067725 8070770 Cooper, you can't ask TARS<br />to do this for us.
8070937 8074774 He's a robot. So you don't have<br />to ask him to do anything.
8074941 8076234 <i>Cooper, you asshole!</i>
8076609 8078611 Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.
8078861 8081114 It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.
8081447 8083908 It's our only chance to<br />save people on Earth.
8084075 8087287 <i>If I can find a way to transmit<br />the quantum data I'll find in there...</i>
8087453 8089289 <i>they might still make it.</i>
8090331 8092959 Let's just hope<br />there's still someone there to save.
8121446 8123114 <i>Maximum velocity achieved.</i>
8124365 8126868 Prepare to fire escape thrusters.

8181714 8184884 This little maneuver's<br />gonna cost us 51 years!
8185760 8188262 You don't sound so bad for pushing 120!

8217125 8219627 <i>- Goodbye, TARS.</i><br />- Goodbye, Dr. Brand.
8219794 8222797 - See you on the other side, Coop.<br />- See you there, Slick!
8231305 8232890 Okay, CASE.
8233933 8237311 <i>- Nice reckless flying!</i><br />- Learned from the master.
8237770 8240356 - Ranger 2, prepare to detach.<br />- What?
8240523 8243443 No! No! Cooper! What are you doing?
8243901 8247613 Newton's third law.<br />You got to leave something behind.
8247780 8250199 You told me we had enough resources<br />for both of us.
8250366 8252118 <i>We agreed, Amelia...</i>
8252493 8253953 90 percent.
8255830 8256914 Don't.
8259125 8260293 Detach.
8273389 8276142 Okay, I am nosing down.
8279937 8281939 Approaching the event horizon.

8290281 8293117 <i>Heading towards blackness.</i>
8293451 8295453 <i>I have a visual of the event.</i>
8295953 8297330 It's all black.
8299457 8301125 TARS, do you read me?
8301459 8302960 It's all blackness.
8304962 8306964 TARS! Do you read me? Over.
8311803 8312970 Okay.
8314180 8315431 Screens...
8317058 8318559 getting interference.

8806130 8809133 <i>Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.</i>
8810926 8813429 - TARS?<br /><i>- Roger that.</i>
8815222 8817850 - You survived.<br /><i>- Somewhere...</i>
8818392 8820436 <i>in their fifth dimension.</i>
8820602 8822938 <i>They saved us.</i>
8823105 8828319 Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?<br />And just why would they want to help us?
8828485 8831196 <i>I don't know, but they constructed<br />this three-dimensional space...</i>
8831363 8834658 <i>inside their five-dimensional reality<br />to allow you to understand it.</i>
8834825 8836785 Yeah, that ain't working.
8836952 8838495 <i>Yes, it is.</i>
8838662 8842541 <i>You've seen that time is represented here<br />as a physical dimension.</i>
8842708 8845544 <i>You have worked out that you can exert<br />a force across space-time.</i>
8846211 8849381 Gravity to send a message.
8849757 8851091 <i>Affirmative.</i>
8853677 8854803 Gravity...
8855929 8859266 can cross the<br />dimensions, including time.
8859600 8860893 <i>Apparently.</i>
8864772 8866774 Do you have the quantum data?
8867191 8868817 <i>Roger. I have it.</i>
8869777 8873781 <i>I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,<br />but nothing is getting out, Cooper.</i>
8873947 8876200 I can do this. I can do this.
8876658 8879411 <i>But such complicated data to a child?</i>
8879578 8880704 Not just any child.
8880871 8882247 What else?
8882790 8884958 Oh, come on, Dad.
8887127 8889296 Murph, the fire's out! Come on!
8889463 8893467 <i>Even if you communicate it here, she won't<br />understand its significance for years.</i>
8894259 8895719 I get that, TARS.
8895886 8900557 But we've got to figure something out or<br />the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!
8900724 8902309 <i>Cooper...</i>
8902476 8904978 <i>they didn't bring us here<br />to change the past.</i>
8908565 8910067 Say that again.
8910234 8913695 <i>They didn't bring us<br />here to change the past.</i>
8918117 8920077 No, they didn't bring us here at all.
8924706 8926375 We brought ourselves.
8935634 8939680 TARS, give me the coordinates<br />for NASA in binary.
8940222 8942683 <i>In binary. Roger. Feeding data.</i>
8966999 8968917 "It's not a ghost."
8970669 8972171 "It's gravity."
8972504 8974173 Don't you get it yet, TARS?
8974840 8976633 I brought myself here!
8977509 8981013 We're here to communicate<br />with the three-dimensional world.
8981430 8982931 We're the bridge!
8990939 8992733 I thought they chose me.
8996069 8999740 - But they didn't choose me, they chose her.<br /><i>- For what, Cooper?</i>
9002242 9003911 To save the world.
9008207 9012586 All of this is one little girl's bedroom.<br />Every moment.
9012920 9014338 It's infinitely complex.
9014505 9019259 They have access to infinite time and<br />space, but they're not bound by anything!
9019426 9024097 They can't find a specific place in time.<br />They can't communicate.
9025599 9028602 That's why I'm here.<br />I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph...
9028769 9030270 just like I found this moment.
9030437 9032773 <i>- How, Cooper?</i><br />- Love, TARS, love.
9032940 9037361 It's just like Brand said. My connection<br />with Murph, it is quantifiable. It's the key!
9037528 9039404 <i>What are we here to do?</i>
9040322 9042199 Find how to tell her.
9044993 9046328 The watch.
9049456 9050624 The watch.
9052000 9053126 That's it.
9055629 9058632 We code the data into the movement<br />of the second hand.
9062261 9065472 TARS, translate the data into Morse<br />and feed it to me.
9065639 9069935 <i>Translating data to Morse.<br />Cooper, what if she never came back for it?</i>
9071603 9074273 She will. She will.
9075482 9077109 Murph, I can see his car!
9078318 9079486 He's coming, Murph!
9081321 9083156 Okay. I'm coming down.
9084616 9086118 <i>How do you know?</i>
9089329 9091164 Because I gave it to her.
9096545 9099047 <i>Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.</i>
9102551 9103677 Dot-dot...
9105012 9106680 dash-dot.
9107139 9108807 <i>Dot-dash-dot-dot.</i>
9109182 9111852 Dot-dash-dot-dot.
9112352 9113687 <i>Dash-dash-dash.</i>
9114021 9116273 Dash, dash, dash.
9134541 9135876 He came back!
9136793 9140964 It was him all the time!<br />I didn't know. It was him!
9142049 9144009 Dad's gonna save us.
9186760 9188011 Eureka!
9191765 9193100 It's traditional.
9197688 9199314 Eureka!
9204027 9205529 Did it work?
9205696 9207531 <i>I think it might have.</i>
9208907 9210200 How do you know?
9210367 9213745 <i>Because the bulk beings<br />are closing the tesseract.</i>
9217582 9219584 Don't you get it yet, TARS?
9220752 9222587 They're not "beings."
9223255 9224589 They're us.
9226633 9229761 What I've been doing for Murph,<br />they're doing for me.
9230303 9231805 For all of us.
9231972 9234224 <i>Cooper, people couldn't build this.</i>
9234391 9236768 No. No, not yet.
9237144 9238603 But one day.
9239271 9242482 Not you and me. But people.
9243150 9247195 A civilization that's evolved past<br />the four dimensions we know.
9253785 9255287 <i>What happens now?</i>
9317891 9319351 Mr. Cooper.
9323563 9325273 All right. Let's take it slow, sir.
9325690 9327818 Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.
9327984 9333031 Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.<br />Actually, you are 124 years old.
9340038 9341373 Take it slow, sir.
9342290 9344584 You were, uh, extremely lucky.
9344918 9348255 The Rangers found you with only minutes<br />left in your oxygen supply.
9362435 9363770 Where am I?
9365438 9366982 Cooper Station.
9368400 9369943 Currently orbiting Saturn.
9371945 9373989 Cooper Station.
9376449 9378451 Nice of you to name it after me.
9382289 9383373 What?
9383540 9386751 The station isn't named after you, sir.<br />It's, uh, named after your daughter.
9387252 9390255 Although she's always maintained<br />just how important you were.
9390422 9392132 Is she still alive?
9394092 9395969 She'll be here in a couple weeks.
9397012 9399472 She is far too old to be transferring<br />from another station...
9399639 9402017 but when she heard<br />that you'd been found...
9403226 9405937 well, this is, uh, Murphy Cooper<br />we're talking about.
9406813 9408315 Yes, it is.
9410442 9412944 We'll have you checked out of here<br />in a couple days.
9415614 9418116 I'm sure you'll be excited to see<br />what's in store.
9419367 9423330 I actually, uh, did a paper on you<br />in high school.
9423663 9425999 I know all about your life back on Earth.
9427667 9428835 Oh, yeah.
9429002 9430253 Right.
9432672 9438011 If... If you'll follow me,<br />we've got a really good situation for you.
9441348 9445393 So, uh, when I made my suggestion<br />to Miss Cooper...
9446311 9449105 I was delighted to hear<br />that she thought it was perfect.
9452484 9455779 <i>It was just constant.<br />Just that steady blow of dirt.</i>
9455946 9458865 Of course, I didn't<br />speak to her personally.
9459032 9461034 <i>We always set the plate upside-down.</i>
9461201 9463954 <i>Glasses or cups,<br />whatever it was, upside-down.</i>
9464120 9469042 <i>Well, my dad was a farmer.<br />Uh, like everybody else back then.</i>
9469209 9471670 <i>There just wasn't enough food.</i>
9471836 9474547 <i>We wore little things, little strips...</i>
9474714 9479886 <i>of sheet over our nose and mouth<br />so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.</i>
9480053 9483515 <i>Well, it was pretty exciting for me<br />because it was hope.</i>
9483682 9487894 <i>I don't care who describes it, there is no<br />way for it to be exaggerated. It was that bad.</i>
9488061 9491731 She did confirm<br />just how much you loved farming.
9492065 9493733 - Oh, she did, did she?<br />- Yeah.
9493900 9495110 Come here.
9495694 9500657 Home sweet home. Everything<br />replaced and put back where it...
9507038 9509082 - Hey, is this...?<br />- Oh, yeah.
9509249 9512252 The machine we found out near Saturn<br />when we found you. Yes.
9512419 9515088 Its, uh, power source was shot,<br />but we could get you another one.
9515255 9517424 Yes. Please.

9560508 9562635 Is this really what it was like?
9564846 9567265 It was never this clean, Slick. Heh.
9571770 9575440 I don't care much for this pretending<br />we're back where we started.
9577525 9579819 I want to know where we are.
9581446 9582989 <i>Where we're going.</i>
9587535 9590622 - Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.<br />- Yeah.
9590789 9591873 Family?
9592040 9595919 Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's<br />been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.
9628993 9630870 You told them I like farming.
9636835 9638503 It was me, Murph.
9640964 9642757 I was your ghost.
9644050 9645677 I know.
9647470 9652183 People didn't believe me. They<br />thought that I was doing it all myself.
9652350 9653393 But...
9656271 9658231 I knew who it was.
9663194 9665363 Nobody believed me.
9665864 9668283 But I knew you'd come back.
9670869 9672078 How?
9674080 9677208 Because my dad promised me.
9683256 9685258 Well, I'm here now, Murph.
9686551 9687886 I'm here.
9689345 9690680 No.
9692765 9696895 No parent should have to watch<br />their own child die.
9699814 9702483 I have my kids here for me now.
9705278 9706779 You go.
9709699 9711201 Where?
9714704 9716289 Brand.
9726132 9727759 <i>She's out there...</i>
9734182 9735934 <i>setting up camp.</i>

9765296 9767966 <i>in a strange galaxy.</i>
9778851 9783523 <i>Maybe right now<br />she's settling in for the long nap...</i>
