74908 76697 Well my dad was a farmer.
78162 80621 Like everybody else back then.
82968 84577 Of course he didn't start that way.
91216 92567 <i>Computer says you are too tight.</i>
93060 94040 <i>No I got this.</i>
94572 95794 <i>Crossing the Straights.</i>
98265 100016 <i>Shutting it down Cooper.<br />No!</i>
101518 103936 <i>Shutting it all down.<br />No I need power up!</i>
108228 109061 Dad?
115866 116771 Sorry Murph.
117200 118476 Go back to bed babe.
118702 120066 I thought you were the ghost.
120495 121209 No.
122873 124924 There are no such things as ghosts babe.
125042 126908 Grandpa says you can get ghosts.
128629 131782 Well maybe that's because Grandpa<br />is a little too close to being one himself.
131961 132961 Back to bed.
133717 135383 Were you dreaming about the crash?
136970 138946 Get your butt back in bed Murph.
166291 167792 The wheat had died.
168627 170798 The blight came and we had to burn it.
171680 174590 And we still had corn.<br />We had acres of corn.
174758 175538 But...
175562 177009 mostly we had dust.
179499 182350 I guess I can't describe it.<br />It was just constant.
182411 185771 Just that steady blow of dirt.
188188 189469 We wore...
189756 191219 little strips of sheet,
191254 194198 but sometimes over our nose and mouth,
194225 196823 so that we would not breathe<br />so much of it.
198532 202055 Well when we set the table<br />we always set the plate upside-down.
202211 204969 Glasses or cups<br />whatever it was upside-down.
210847 211866 Shake a leg!
211890 213268 Murph get a move on!
213293 216862 Tom 4 o'clock today you and me<br />in the barn Herbicide Resistance 101.
216925 218229 Check?<br />Yes sir.
219970 221137 Not at the table Murph.
222389 223723 Dad can you fix this?
225790 227922 What the heck did you do to my lander?<br />Was not me.
228426 230461 Let me guess. It was your ghost?
230689 231886 It knocked it off my shelf.
231910 233141 It keeps knocking books off.
233191 234649 No such things as ghosts dumb-ass.
234687 236076 Hey.<br />I looked it up.
236101 237230 It's called a poltergeist.
237255 238389 Dad tell her.
238414 240775 Well it's not very scientific Murph.
240800 243135 You said science was about admitting<br />what we don't know.
243262 245076 She has got you there.<br />Hey.
245495 246996 Start looking after our stuff.
248569 249433 Coop.
252565 254732 Alright Murph you wanna talk science?
255756 257787 Don't just tell me that you are afraid<br />of some ghost.
257812 259164 No you got to go further.
259189 262149 You got to record the facts analyze<br />get to the how and why...
262251 263923 and present your conclusions.
264516 265399 Deal?
266099 267516 Deal.<br />Alright.
270354 272304 Have a good day at school.<br />Hold up.
272777 275070 Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.
275317 276726 Not grandparent.
279529 280889 Slow down Turbo.
282699 283771 That's not a dust storm.
284139 285911 Nelson is torching his whole crop.
285994 286811 Blight?
287178 289443 They are saying<br />it's the last harvest for okra.
290624 291370 Ever.
293710 296058 He should have planted corn<br />like the rest of us.
296505 298988 Now you be nice to that Miss Hanley.<br />She is single.
299383 300649 What's that supposed to mean?
300894 304021 Repopulating the earth start<br />pulling your weight young man.
304346 306575 Why don't you start minding<br />your own business...
307458 308602 old man?
315497 316959 Alright Murph give me second.
320696 321871 Third.
323615 325643 Find a gear dumb-ass.<br />Grind it!
325668 326710 Shut it Tom!
327869 330441 What did you do Murph?<br />She didn't do nothing.
330716 333217 Blew a tire is all.<br />Murphy's Law.
333709 334822 Shut up!
334847 337079 Grab the spare Tom.<br />That is the spare.
339589 340798 Get the patch kit!
342204 343914 How am I supposed to patch it out here?
344134 345351 You got to figure it out.
345762 347447 I am not always gonna be here to help you.
356148 357764 What's going on Murph?
358066 360803 Why did you and Mom name me<br />after something that's bad?
361374 362421 No we didn't.
363196 364257 Murphy's Law?
365699 368523 Murphy's Law doesn't mean<br />that something bad...
369304 371734 will happen. What it means<br />is whatever can happen...
372601 373491 will happen.
373558 375418 And that sounded just fine with us.
382340 383324 Get in.
385103 386259 Get in, let's go.
387763 389802 What about the flat tire?
392851 393985 Yeah.
408158 409814 It's an Indian Air Force drone.
409838 412161 Solar cells could power an entire farm.
412186 413550 Take the wheel Tom.
419252 420586 Go, go, go!
422172 423758 Keep that aimed right at it.
431765 434083 Faster Tom. I am losing it.
434851 435893 Right at it.
437895 438895 Stay on it.
440023 441329 Here we go.
450367 451631 Nice one Tom.
458416 459433 Dad?
460210 462562 I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!
463421 464222 Dad!
464798 465628 Tom!
470554 472478 You told me to keep driving.
473723 477785 Well I guess that answers the old<br />if I asked you to drive off a cliff scenario.
481398 482345 We lost it.
482369 484233 No we didn't.
496913 498301 Want to give it a whirl?
504588 505611 This way.
511344 512322 Go.
513430 516432 Let's lay her down right there<br />at the edge of the reservoir.
520729 521744 Nicely done.
525442 527080 How long you think it's been up there?
527485 530029 Delhi Mission Control went down<br />same as ours
530197 531368 ten years ago.
532365 534017 So for ten years?
537245 538651 Why did it come down so low?
538675 539690 I don't know.
540141 543059 Maybe the sun cooked its brain<br />or it was looking for something.
543126 543865 What?
544045 545354 Give me a large flat blade.
545795 547326 Maybe some kind of signal?
547740 548685 I don't know.
553720 555221 What are you gonna do with it?
556139 559012 I am gonna give it something<br />socially responsible to do...
560185 561684 like drive a combine.
562204 563705 Can't we just let it go?
565899 567366 It was not hurting anybody.
569236 571330 This thing needs to learn<br />how to adapt Murph...
572030 573338 like the rest of us.
578251 579971 So How does this work?<br />You guys come with?
580183 581225 I have got class.
581456 582380 This one...
582709 583759 needs to wait.
585377 586377 What did you do?
586495 588307 They will tell you about it<br />when you get in there.
588332 590500 Am I not gonna be mad?<br />Not with me.
590525 592341 Just please try not to.<br />Hey.
592365 593437 Relax.
595262 596345 I got this.
600971 602142 Little late Coop.
602403 603846 Yeah we had a flat.
604020 607564 And I guess you had to stop<br />off at the Asian fighter plane store.
607857 609514 No actually sir that's a...
609538 611443 That's a surveillance drone.
611611 613970 With outstanding solar cells.<br />It's Indian.
614671 615829 Take a seat.
617242 618243 So...
619452 621405 we got Tom's scores back.
622580 624540 He is going to make an excellent farmer.
624702 626489 Yeah he has got a knack for it.
626670 627928 What about college?
628378 632159 Well the... university only takes a handful.<br />They don't really have the resources to...
632184 633807 I still pay my taxes.
634759 637128 Where is that money go?<br />There is no more armies.
637262 639129 Well it doesn't go to the university.
640499 641981 Look Coop you have to be realistic.
642006 644325 You are ruling my son out for college now?
645312 646438 The kid is 15.
646462 648814 Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
649816 651013 What's your waistline?
651037 652308 About what 32?
652402 653975 About a 33 inseam?
654362 656070 I am not sure I see<br />what you are getting at.
656071 658551 You are telling me it takes two numbers<br />to measure your own ass
658575 660594 but only one to measure my son's future?
661536 662441 Come on.
662794 664591 You are a well-educated man, Coop.
664697 666656 And a trained pilot.<br />And an engineer.
667042 668781 Ok well right now,
669086 671338 we don't need more engineers.
672333 675079 We didn't run out of television screens<br />and planes.
675103 676670 We ran out of food.
676926 678499 The world needs farmers.
678877 680346 Good farmers like you.
680513 682578 And Tom.<br />Uneducated farmers.
683808 685840 We are a caretaker generation Coop.
686301 687728 And things are getting better.
687896 690660 Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...<br />We done here sir?
692317 693176 No.
694360 696317 Miss Hanley is here to talk about Murph.
696738 698644 Murph is a great kid.
698668 699469 She is really bright.
699495 701202 But she has been having<br />a little trouble lately.
701227 702030 She...
702054 703649 brought this in to show the students.
703673 705330 The section on the lunar landings.
705355 707565 Yeah it's one of my old textbooks.
708460 710461 She always loved the pictures.
710543 711827 It's an old federal textbook.
711851 713878 We have replaced them<br />with the corrected versions.
714422 715464 Corrected?
715772 719381 Explaining how the Apollo missions were<br />faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
726717 728676 You don't believe we went to the moon?
729638 731761 I believe it was a brilliant piece<br />of propaganda.
731786 733638 That the Soviets bankrupted themselves,
733662 736871 pouring resources into rockets<br />and other useless machines.
737153 738237 Useless machines.
738459 742545 And if we don't want a repeat of the excess<br />and wastefulness of the 20th century then...
742752 744523 we need to teach our kids<br />about this planet,
744718 746194 not tales of leaving it.
747288 750766 You know one of those useless machines<br />they used to make was called an MRI.
751930 753617 And if we had any of those left,
753642 756789 the doctors would have been able to find<br />the cyst in my wife's brain,
756829 759029 before she died instead of afterwards.
759092 761841 Then she would have been the one<br />sitting here listening to this,
761866 765115 instead of me which would have been<br />a good thing because she was always...
766015 767247 the calmer one.
768184 769956 I am sorry about your wife Mr. Cooper.
771521 772134 But...
772401 775333 Murph got into a fistfight with several<br />of her classmates over this...
775460 776854 Apollo nonsense.
777464 780336 So we thought it would be best to bring you<br />in and see what ideas you might have
780361 782242 for dealing with her<br />behavior on the home front.
783700 785064 Yeah you know what...
785231 786886 There is a game, tomorrow night.
787109 789360 She is going through a bit<br />of a baseball phase.
789385 792915 Her favorite team is playing.<br />There is gonna be candy and soda and...
796629 798290 I think I will take her to that.
803678 804744 How did it go?
806058 807603 I got you suspended.
808203 809537 What?<br /><i>Cooper.</i>
811227 812394 This is Cooper. Go.
812562 815305 <i>Coop those combines<br />you rebuilt went haywire.</i>
815689 817457 Just reset the controllers.
818067 820694 <i>I did that.<br />Now you should come take a look.</i>
840566 843286 One by one they ave been peeling<br />off the fields and heading over.
843687 845521 Something is interfering with the compass.
846930 848906 Magnetism or some such.
892568 894435 Nothing special about which book.
894638 896789 I have been working on it, like you said.
897564 898803 I counted the spaces.
899100 899943 Why?
902187 903758 In case the ghost<br />is trying to communicate.
905144 906360 I am trying Morse.
907177 908156 Morse?
908809 909547 Yeah.
910344 913244 Dots and dashes used...<br />I know what Morse code is, Murph.
913269 915736 I just don't think your bookshelf<br />is trying to talk to you.
927587 929424 Had to reset every compass clock
929449 931815 and GPS to offset for the anomaly.
932376 933254 Which is?
933566 934579 I don't know.
936782 938985 Maybe the house was built<br />on magnetic ore,
939039 941444 we would have seen this the first time<br />we switched on the tractor.
944647 947359 I hear your meeting at the school<br />didn't go so well.
949443 950430 You heard?
951111 953500 It's like we have forgotten<br />who we are Donald.
955686 958818 Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.
961013 962333 When I was a kid...
962545 965369 it felt like they made something<br />new every day.
965612 966591 Some...
967050 968789 gadget or idea.
969031 970643 Like every day was Christmas.
970803 971792 But six...
972081 973526 billion people...
973991 975471 just try to imagine that.
976963 979579 And every last one of them<br />trying to have it all.
983359 984930 This world isn't so bad.
987587 989232 And Tom will do just fine.
989548 991270 You are the one who doesn't belong.
991403 994412 Born 40 years too late<br />or 40 years too early.
995374 997428 My daughter knew it, God bless her.
998581 999862 And your kids know it.
999886 1001120 Especially Murph.
1001709 1004698 Well we used to look<br />up in the sky and wonder...
1005444 1007238 at our place in the stars.
1010179 1011707 Now we just look down...
1012258 1014633 and worry about our place in the dirt.
1014972 1015711 Cooper,
1015993 1017415 you were good at something...
1018290 1020639 and you never got a chance<br />to do anything with it.
1021530 1022647 I am sorry.
1024606 1026526 You didn't expect this dirt,
1026550 1028734 that was giving you this food...
1029038 1032123 to turn on you like that and destroy you.
1032407 1034521 In April I believe I am right...
1034888 1037035 Fifteenth of April I think.
1037060 1039574 This happened about 1:30<br />when that thing
1039747 1041598 came off the top of that canyon.
1043341 1045467 In my day we had real ballplayers.
1045503 1047043 Who are these bums?
1047957 1049932 Well in my day people were too busy
1049957 1052200 fighting over food to even play baseball.
1052635 1054959 Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.
1056111 1057345 I want a hot dog.
1057533 1059447 School says you are gonna<br />follow in my footsteps.
1060708 1061822 I think that's great.
1062469 1063676 You think that's great?
1063895 1065438 You hate farming Dad.
1066441 1067485 Grandpa said.
1068155 1069399 Grandpa said?
1070212 1072370 Listen all that matters<br />is how you feel about it.
1072904 1074206 I like what you do.
1075158 1076386 I like our farm.
1077326 1078761 You are gonna be great at it.
1092134 1093252 Let's get out of here.
1100558 1102418 Alright it's a doozy.
1103269 1104957 Alright gang let's mask up.
1108441 1109596 Tom? Murph?
1109620 1110628 Yeah.<br />Check?
1163996 1166378 Murph, Tom, you guys,<br />shut your windows?
1170894 1171696 Murph?
1193484 1194479 The ghost.
1196028 1197136 Grab your pillow.
1198298 1199571 You sleep in with Tom.
1255212 1256241 It's not a ghost.
1262131 1263192 It's gravity.
1265589 1267661 I am dropping Tom then heading to town.
1268017 1269256 You want to clean that up,
1270418 1272127 when you have finished praying to it?
1297546 1300023 It's not Morse Murph. It's binary.
1300494 1302892 Thick is one, thin is zero.
1306722 1307907 Coordinates.
1310869 1311705 Nope.
1314605 1315772 Here we go.
1317358 1318572 Thirty-three.
1321896 1322749 That's it.
1324198 1325699 I can't miss this!
1326033 1328757 Grandpa will be back<br />in a couple hours Murph.
1329996 1332113 But you don't know what you are gonna find.
1333681 1334715 And that...
1336085 1337801 is why I can't take you.
1344260 1345181 Murph?
1347471 1350478 Grandpa will be home in a while.<br />Tell him I will call him on the radio.
1357548 1358463 Jesus.
1359400 1360564 What are you doing?
1361485 1363111 Oh you think this is funny?
1363993 1365921 You would not be here,<br />if it was not for me.
1368117 1369905 Make yourself useful.
1433575 1434508 Murph?
1436435 1437138 Murph!
1440981 1442802 I think this is the end of the road.
1446320 1448178 Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?
1449532 1450881 That's my girl.
1478519 1480073 Step away from the fence!<br />No! No! No!
1480098 1481926 Don't shoot! Don't shoot!<br />I am not armed.
1482147 1483347 My daughter is in the car.
1488971 1490244 Don't be afraid.
1503544 1505099 How did you find this place?
1506463 1507797 Where is my daughter?
1508099 1510790 You had the coordinates for this facility<br />marked on your map.
1510815 1512051 Where did you get those coordinates?
1512052 1513456 Where is my daughter?
1513481 1516065 Don't make me take you down again.<br />Sit down!
1516900 1519110 Oh you still think you are a Marine pal?
1519185 1521392 Marines don't exist anymore.
1522062 1525264 And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.
1525564 1527168 Where did you find those coordinates?
1527248 1529363 But you don't look much like a lawnmower.
1529945 1532910 Think I will turn you into<br />an overqualified vacuum cleaner.
1532948 1533988 No you won't.
1535784 1536606 TARS,
1536895 1537967 back down please.
1539205 1540652 You know you are taking a risk,
1540676 1542666 using ex-military security.
1542791 1545115 They are old and their control units are...
1545749 1546770 unpredictable.
1547005 1548723 It's what the government could spare.
1550466 1551478 Who are you?
1552092 1553003 Dr. Brand.
1553746 1556322 I knew a Dr. Brand once.<br />He was a professor.
1556542 1558042 What makes you think I am not?
1558307 1560206 Was not near as cute either.
1560976 1562340 Please Dr. Brand.
1562364 1563785 I don't have any idea what this is.
1564457 1567028 Now I am scared for my daughter<br />and want her by my side.
1567075 1569535 You give me that I will tell you<br />anything you want to know.
1573032 1575464 Get the principals and the girl<br />in the conference room please.
1577369 1578683 Your daughter is fine.
1579220 1580262 Bright kid.
1580691 1582425 Must have a very smart mother.
1582536 1585133 It's pretty clear you<br />don't want any visitors.
1585217 1587282 So why don't you just let us back up<br />from your fence
1587306 1589137 and we will be on our way?
1589572 1590952 It's not that simple.<br />Well...
1591140 1592165 sure it is.
1592388 1595540 I don't know anything about you.<br />I don't know anything about this place.
1596832 1597861 Yes you do.
1603769 1604523 Dad!
1607687 1608728 Hello Cooper.
1610158 1611200 Professor Brand.
1612737 1614896 Explain to me how you found this facility.
1615426 1616561 Kind of an accident.
1616585 1617521 We sort of stumbled upon it.
1617545 1618720 We were on a salvage run...
1618745 1621317 You are sitting in the best-kept<br />secret in the world.
1621704 1623109 Nobody stumbles in here.
1623171 1624888 Nobody stumbles out.
1625541 1626279 Cooper,
1626623 1627388 please.
1627668 1629333 Cooperate with these people.
1629802 1630599 Look.
1632047 1633575 It's kind of hard to explain.
1634049 1636206 Now we learned these...
1636534 1637499 coordinates,
1637702 1638816 from an anomaly.
1639112 1640248 What sort of anomaly?
1640308 1642420 I hesitate to term it supernatural,
1642444 1643881 but it definitely was not scientific.
1643906 1646814 You are going to have to be specific<br />Mr. Cooper.
1646866 1647854 Right now.
1648022 1649170 It was gravity.
1654294 1657169 What sort of gravitational anomaly?<br />Where was this?
1657323 1660520 Now I am real happy that you are<br />excited about gravity bud but..
1661083 1663674 You are not getting any answers<br />from us until I get assurances.
1663751 1665385 Assurances?<br />Yeah.
1666422 1667821 Like that we are getting out of here.
1668250 1670041 And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.
1672327 1674226 Don't you know who we are Coop?
1674590 1675840 No professor, I don't.
1676008 1677835 You know my father Professor Brand.
1678635 1679788 We are NASA.
1681722 1682544 NASA?
1682796 1683663 NASA.
1684266 1686059 The same NASA, you flew for.
1697112 1698922 I heard they shut you down sir.
1698947 1700604 For refusing to drop bombs,
1700628 1702829 from the stratosphere onto starving people.
1703220 1707197 When they realized that killing other<br />people was not a long-term solution
1707345 1709487 then they needed us back.<br />In secret.
1709790 1710719 Why secret?
1710793 1714629 Because public opinion would not<br />allow spending on space exploration.
1714963 1717256 Not while you are struggling<br />to put food on the table.
1718801 1719640 Blight.
1720427 1721041 Wheat,
1721236 1722417 seven years ago.
1722846 1724263 Okra, this year.
1725015 1726457 Now there is just corn.
1727126 1729085 And we are growing more<br />than we ever have.
1729110 1733027 But like the potatoes in Ireland<br />and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...
1733899 1734763 the corn...
1735195 1736401 will die.
1737261 1738109 Soon.
1743671 1746791 We will find a way professor.<br />We always have.
1747994 1750028 Driven by the unshakable faith,
1750052 1751604 the Earth is ours.
1752412 1754036 Not just ours, no.
1755104 1756505 But it is our home.
1757673 1759037 Earth's atmosphere,
1759208 1760288 is 80 percent...
1760629 1762885 nitrogen. We don't even breathe nitrogen.
1763196 1764125 Blight does.
1764149 1765543 And as it thrives,
1765668 1768059 our air gets less and less oxygen.
1768738 1771871 The last people to starve<br />will be the first to suffocate.
1772382 1774074 And your daughter's generation...
1776024 1777976 will be the last to survive on Earth.
1778545 1780262 Murph is feeling a little tired.
1780286 1782281 I was wondering<br />if she could take a nap in my office.
1782531 1783922 Yeah. Thank you.
1786827 1787640 Ok...
1788871 1790110 now you need to tell me,
1790134 1792050 what your plan is to save the world.
1793041 1795073 We are not meant, to save the world.
1795643 1797091 We are meant to leave it.
1802384 1803426 Rangers.
1803719 1806751 The last components of our<br />one versatile ship,
1806844 1808681 in orbit the Endurance.
1808974 1810600 Our final expedition.
1811393 1812382 You sent...
1812971 1814760 people out there<br />looking for a new home?
1814980 1816272 The Lazarus missions.
1816731 1817929 Oh that sounds cheerful.
1817953 1819691 Lazarus came back from the dead.
1819902 1822269 Sure but he had to die in the first place.
1822529 1825627 There is not a planet in our solar system<br />that could sustain life,
1825652 1828105 and the nearest star<br />is over a thousand years away
1828130 1830465 and that doesn't even qualify as futile.
1832593 1833754 Where did you send them?
1834166 1835059 Cooper...
1835751 1837365 I can't tell you anymore,
1837532 1840043 unless you agree to pilot this craft.
1840714 1842537 You are the best pilot we ever had.
1842561 1844165 I barely left the stratosphere.
1844301 1846517 This team never left the simulator.
1846762 1847792 We need a pilot,
1847816 1850400 and this is the mission<br />that you were trained for.
1850872 1852373 Without even knowing it?
1853268 1855573 An hour ago,<br />you didn't even know I was alive.
1855597 1857362 I mean, you-you-you were going anyway.
1857689 1859089 We had no choice.
1859823 1861448 But something sent you here.
1861652 1862724 They chose you.
1863130 1864214 Who is they?
1872415 1873318 How long...
1873717 1874707 would I be gone?
1874831 1875737 Hard to know.
1876673 1877595 Years?
1878538 1879993 I have got kids professor.
1880758 1882947 Get out there and save them.
1886314 1887290 Who is they?
1887748 1891542 We started detecting gravitational<br />anomalies almost 50 years ago.
1891825 1895180 Mostly small distortions to our instruments<br />in the upper atmosphere.
1895477 1898604 In fact, I believe you<br />encountered one yourself.
1899397 1900925 Yeah over the Straights.
1902276 1903807 My crash. Something...
1904018 1905362 tripped my fly-by-wire.
1905487 1906354 Exactly.
1907674 1909144 But of all these anomalies,
1910112 1912292 the most significant, is this.
1912619 1913948 Out near Saturn...
1914866 1916450 a disturbance of space-time.
1919001 1920073 Is that a wormhole?
1920451 1921959 It appeared 48 years ago.
1922588 1924865 And it leads where?
1925048 1926326 Another galaxy.
1928427 1930678 A wormhole is not a naturally<br />occurring phenomenon.
1930846 1932263 Someone placed it there.
1933056 1933779 They?
1935058 1936381 And whoever they are...
1936995 1938800 they appear to be looking out for us.
1939605 1940760 That wormhole,
1940784 1942393 lets us travel to other stars.
1942659 1944323 It came along right as we needed it.
1944396 1947314 They ave put potentially habitable<br />worlds right within our reach.
1947638 1949556 Twelve in fact from our initial probes.
1949872 1951364 You sent probes into that?
1952159 1953606 We sent people into it.
1954341 1955403 Ten years ago.
1956496 1957856 The Lazarus missions.
1958599 1959975 Twelve possible worlds...
1960008 1961531 twelve Ranger launches.
1961857 1962644 Carrying...
1962669 1964075 the bravest humans,
1964099 1965161 ever to live.
1965255 1967882 Led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.
1968249 1971465 Each person's landing pod had<br />enough life support for two years.
1971553 1974127 But they could use hibernation<br />to stretch that making...
1974346 1976952 observations on organics<br />over a decade or more.
1977059 1979174 Their mission was to assess their world
1979322 1980670 and if it showed potential...
1981307 1983887 then they could send out a signal bed<br />down for the long nap,
1984461 1985728 wait to be rescued.
1985817 1987765 And what if the world didn't show promise?
1988791 1989836 Hence the bravery.
1990697 1993240 You don't have the resources<br />to visit all 12.
1993408 1994231 No.
1995614 1998278 Data transmission back<br />through the wormhole is rudimentary.
1998372 2000570 Simple binary pings on an annual basis
2000594 2003372 give us some clue as to which worlds<br />have potential.
2003894 2005575 And one system shows promise.
2005712 2007930 And one, that's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?
2009091 2011881 One system with three potential worlds?
2012344 2013453 A long shot?
2016098 2017070 Ok.
2017933 2019633 So if we find a home...
2023109 2023968 then what?
2024236 2026080 That's the long shot.
2026733 2027805 There is a Plan A,
2028385 2029588 and a Plan B.
2030609 2033694 Did you notice anything strange<br />about the launch chamber?
2045127 2048045 This entire facility is a centrifuge.
2048380 2049702 Some kind of vehicle.
2050153 2051098 A space station?
2051216 2051913 Both.
2052080 2052973 Plan A.
2053135 2054681 How do you get it off the ground?
2055387 2056806 The first gravitational,
2057109 2059119 anomalies changed everything.
2059391 2060630 Suddenly we knew,
2060841 2062298 that harnessing gravity,
2062540 2063447 was real.
2064062 2066530 So, I started working on a theory and...
2066804 2068733 we started building this station.
2069109 2070874 But you have not solved it yet.
2072279 2073708 That's why there is Plan B.
2074560 2076145 The problem is gravity.
2076169 2079107 How to get a viable amount<br />of human life off the planet.
2079436 2080529 This is one way.
2080829 2081651 Plan B.
2081752 2083063 A population bomb.
2083665 2085613 Over 5000 fertilized eggs,
2085985 2087961 weighing in at just under 900 kilos.
2089272 2090549 Well how would you raise them?
2090656 2093346 With equipment on board<br />we incubate the first 10.
2093425 2095671 After that, with surrogacy,
2095695 2097303 the growth becomes exponential.
2098156 2101026 Within 30 years we could have<br />a colony of hundreds.
2101647 2105024 The real difficulty with colonization<br />is genetic diversity.
2105479 2106731 This takes care of that.
2107267 2109489 But what about the people here?<br />You just...
2110173 2111506 you give up on them?
2111985 2112966 My kids?
2113872 2115476 That's why Plan A.
2115602 2116963 Is a lot more fun.
2119492 2120815 How far have you got?
2121078 2122244 Almost there.
2122412 2124516 You are asking me to hang everything...
2126116 2127381 on an almost?
2127751 2129803 I am asking you, to trust me.
2133248 2134626 Find us a new home.
2135651 2137152 And by the time you return...
2138136 2139584 I will have solved the problem,
2139608 2140607 of gravity.
2141897 2143271 I give you my word.
2155987 2157073 Go away!
2168166 2169064 Murph.
2169584 2170198 Go!
2170589 2172283 If you are leaving just go.
2175460 2177749 This world was never enough for you,<br />was it Coop?
2179052 2182405 What, because heading out there<br />is what I feel like I was born to do?
2183765 2185237 And it excites me?
2186309 2188565 No that does not make it wrong.
2188937 2189862 It might.
2190438 2193151 Don't trust the right thing<br />done for the wrong reason.
2194317 2196652 The why of the thing<br />that's the foundation.
2196820 2198595 And the foundation is solid.
2202075 2206522 We farmers we sit here every year<br />when the rains fail and we say.
2207372 2208350 Next year.
2209291 2212514 Well next year ain't gonna<br />save us nor the one after that.
2213595 2217558 This world is a treasure Donald but<br />it's been telling us to leave for a while now.
2222496 2226035 Mankind was born on Earth<br />it was never meant to die here.
2229782 2232696 Tom will be alright but you got<br />to make things right with Murph.
2232939 2233837 I will.
2235081 2237650 Without making promises you<br />don't know you can keep.
2248747 2250358 You have to talk to me Murph.
2253251 2255377 I need to fix this before I go.
2255545 2257889 Then I will keep it<br />broken so you have to stay.
2260008 2265012 After you kids came along your mom she said<br />something to me I never quite understood.
2265403 2266679 She said now...
2268892 2270214 We are just here...
2271167 2273056 to be memories for our kids.
2278526 2280835 And I think that now<br />I understand what she meant.
2284783 2288033 Once you are a parent you are<br />the ghost of your children's future.
2290279 2291887 You said ghosts didn't exist.
2298797 2300012 That's right Murph.
2303510 2304729 Murph look at me.
2307889 2310034 I can't be your ghost right now.
2312185 2313679 I need to exist.
2315814 2317398 They chose me.
2318526 2319848 Murph they chose me.
2319872 2322129 You saw.<br />You are the one who led me to them.
2325179 2327176 That's exactly why you can't go.
2330745 2332304 I figured out the message.
2333123 2334111 One word.
2334366 2335488 Know what it is?
2335857 2336476 Murph.
2336850 2337616 Stay.
2338211 2339158 It says...
2339518 2341156 Stay Dad.<br />Murph.
2342048 2343507 You don't believe me.
2343675 2344747 Look at the books!
2344771 2346468 Look at this. It says, Stay.
2346636 2348626 Why you are not listening!
2348650 2349815 It says, Stay!
2349931 2351401 No, I am coming back.
2352096 2353151 When?
2366468 2367478 One for you,
2367851 2368968 one for me.
2369234 2371335 When I am up there in hypersleep,
2371760 2372358 or...
2372921 2374960 or traveling near the speed of light
2375225 2375861 or...
2376416 2377865 near a black hole...
2378853 2380616 time is gonna to change for me.
2381459 2383048 And it's going to run more slowly.
2383502 2384221 Now...
2385242 2386587 when I get back...
2388384 2389548 we are going to compare.
2389707 2391814 Time will run differently for us?<br />Yeah.
2393099 2396317 By the time I get back we might<br />even be the same age,
2396632 2397864 you and me.
2398333 2399186 What?
2399697 2400950 Imagine that!
2405663 2406366 Murph...
2406580 2408671 You have no idea when you are coming back.
2410878 2412378 No idea at all!
2415543 2417981 Murph don't.<br />Don't make me leave like this.
2418050 2419035 Come on Murph!
2419841 2421809 Don't make me leave like this Murph!
2429917 2430727 Hey...
2431463 2432500 I love you.
2433063 2434664 Forever. You hear me?
2435308 2436631 I love you forever,
2437045 2438362 and I am coming back.
2444317 2445434 I am coming back.
2463987 2464971 How did it go?
2465527 2466515 Fine.
2466540 2467643 Just fine.
2475122 2476153 I love you Tom.
2476840 2478051 Travel safe?<br />Yeah.
2478685 2480426 You look after our place for me alright?
2481104 2481973 Alright?
2487554 2489100 Hey can I use your truck<br />while you are gone?
2489279 2490502 You mean your truck?
2492317 2493783 I will make sure they bring it back.
2496205 2497674 Look after my kids Donald!

2565605 2566761 Everybody good?
2566785 2568870 Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?
2571194 2574323 They gave him a humor setting<br />so he would fit in better with his unit.
2574986 2576490 He thinks it relaxes us.
2576658 2579236 A giant sarcastic robot.
2580328 2581745 What a great idea!
2581913 2584623 I have a cue light I can use<br />when I am joking if you like.
2584791 2585832 That had probably help.
2586000 2587907 Yeah you can use it to find<br />your way back to the ship,
2587931 2589433 after I blow you out the airlock.
2591005 2592745 What's your humor setting TARS?

2659452 2660583 And when not to.
2662631 2663942 Just being honest.
2664412 2666347 I don't think you need to be that honest.
2667063 2669481 Hey TARS, what's your honesty parameter?
2669751 2670781 Ninety percent.
2671174 2672377 Ninety percent?
2672402 2675219 Absolute honesty isn't always<br />the most diplomatic
2675244 2678531 nor the safest form of communication<br />with emotional beings.
2678594 2679531 Ok.
2680248 2682546 Ninety percent it is Dr. Brand.
2686768 2688257 We are coming up on the Endurance.

3035449 3036598 Here. Pills.
3039537 3040801 So alone.
3041455 3043574 We have each other.<br />Dr. Mann had it worse.
3043691 3045067 No, I mean them.
3046700 3049533 It's a perfect planet and we are not<br />gonna find another one like her.
3050297 3051787 No, it's not like...
3052279 3053942 looking for a new condo.
3054677 3056662 The human race is going to be...
3057046 3057951 adrift...
3058556 3061658 desperate for a rock it can cling<br />to while it catches its breath.
3062443 3063925 We need to find that rock.
3064918 3067344 And our three prospects are at the edge
3067368 3069355 of what might sustain human life.
3070067 3071223 Laura Miller's planet,
3071265 3072345 is first.
3072554 3074780 Laura started our biology program and...
3079934 3081358 Wolf Edmunds is here.
3081522 3082643 Tell me about Edmunds.
3084853 3086360 Wolf is a particle physicist.
3088878 3090595 None of them had families?
3092256 3093745 No. No attachments.
3093769 3095133 My father insisted.
3095301 3098845 They all knew the odds against ever<br />seeing another human being again.
3099013 3100973 I am hoping we can surprise<br />at least three of them.
3101046 3102963 How about Mann?<br />Dr. Mann?
3103170 3105088 He is remarkable. He is the best of us.
3105311 3109689 He inspired 11 people to follow him<br />on the loneliest journey in human history.
3109857 3111441 Scientists, explorers.
3111609 3112805 That's what I love.
3113401 3115992 You know out there we face great odds.
3116134 3117312 Death but...
3119366 3120312 not evil.
3120930 3122681 You don't think nature can be evil?
3123026 3123608 No.
3123717 3125528 Formidable. Frightening. But...
3126582 3127983 no, not evil.
3129835 3130657 Is a lion,
3130954 3132958 evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds?
3133484 3135163 Just what we take with us then.
3136028 3136781 Yeah.
3137551 3139636 This crew represents the best of humanity.
3139804 3140922 Even me?
3141138 3143139 You know what? We agreed 90 percent.
3143494 3144517 There you go.
3144809 3146939 Don't stay up.<br />I will be there in a minute.
3147353 3148814 Hold on, just remember Coop,
3148922 3151002 you are literally wasting your breath.
3158072 3159061 Hey TARS?
3159085 3160939 Let's go over that trajectory one more time.
3161575 3162986 Eight months to Mars.
3163744 3165609 Counter-orbital slingshot around.
3165633 3168164 Fourteen months to Saturn.<br />Nothing is changed on that.
3168189 3169509 Just let me ask you something.
3172670 3174747 Dr. Brand and Edmunds...<br />Why are you whispering?
3174772 3175834 They can't hear you.
3177591 3179178 Dr. Brand and Edmunds.
3179918 3180865 They close?
3181045 3182115 I would not know.
3182244 3185119 Is that 90 percent would not know<br />or 10 percent would not know?
3185283 3187310 I also have a discretion setting Cooper.
3190104 3191822 But not a poker face Slick.
3204406 3205453 Hey guys.
3206597 3208992 Dad is about to go down for the long nap.
3209707 3212156 So I wanted to give you an update.
3214169 3216279 The Earth looks amazing from here.
3218424 3220208 You can't see any of the dust.
3222560 3224940 <i>I really hope you guys are doing great.</i>
3225890 3228004 <i>I know you will get this message.<br />Professor Brand,</i>
3228029 3230144 <i>assured me that he will get it to you.</i>
3230686 3232237 <i>Know that I love you.</i>
3234148 3236257 Is it him?<br />I don't think so Murph.
3243584 3244841 You must be Donald.
3247044 3248021 Hello Murph.
3249163 3250888 Why are you in my dad's truck?
3251735 3253421 He wanted me to bring it for your brother.
3254610 3256562 He sent you a message.
3260171 3261950 She is pretty upset with him for leaving.
3262020 3265707 If you record any messages I can<br />get them to transmit it to Cooper.
3267251 3268003 Murph,
3268182 3269653 is a bright spark.
3270976 3271840 Maybe,
3272007 3273405 I should fan the flame.
3273749 3275772 She is already making<br />fools of her teachers.
3276440 3278640 So maybe she should come<br />and make a fool out of you.
3280361 3281183 So where are they?
3281745 3283017 Heading for Mars.
3283906 3285645 The next time you hear from Cooper,
3285911 3287767 they will be coming up on Saturn.
3327266 3328786 <i>As far as school goes</i>
3328943 3332405 <i>the administration wants me to repeat<br />Plant Pathology. Which sucks.</i>
3333312 3333902 <i>But,</i>
3334081 3336678 <i>they said I could start<br />Advanced Agriculture a year early.</i>
3338398 3340492 <i>Alright, I got to go Dad.</i>
3340711 3342070 <i>Hope you are safe up there.</i>
3346745 3347927 <i>Sorry Coop.</i>
3348095 3349876 <i>I asked Murph to say hi...</i>
3350126 3352613 <i>but she is as stubborn as her old man.</i>
3353350 3354736 I will try again next time.
3370285 3371741 You alright Rom?
3374324 3375754 This gets to me Cooper.
3376123 3377488 This. This.
3378292 3380949 Millimeters of aluminum<br />that's it and then nothing...
3381336 3383243 out there for millions of miles,
3383447 3384872 won't kill us in seconds.
3386359 3388122 You know that some of the finest
3388302 3391841 solo yachtsmen in the world<br />don't know how to swim?
3392668 3393670 They don't know how.
3393694 3395444 And if they go overboard<br />psst they are done.
3397644 3399201 We are explorers Rom.
3401148 3402303 This is our boat.
3403025 3403946 Here.
3431261 3433097 This is from the relay probe?
3433180 3435313 It was in orbit around the wormhole.
3435724 3438503 This is the wormhole,<br />and every time we come around...
3439029 3442153 we would receive images from the other<br />side of the foreign galaxy.
3442481 3444607 Oh yeah.<br />Like swinging a periscope around.
3444775 3445674 Exactly.
3446026 3447866 So we got a pretty good idea
3448009 3449872 what we are gonna find on the other side?
3451498 3452832 Navigationally.
3454299 3457679 <i>Guys? Looks like we will be approaching<br />the wormhole in about three hours.</i>
3464545 3465499 Hey Coop?
3466400 3467739 Can we stop the spinning?
3468311 3469153 Why?
3469562 3471551 Because we are close enough to see it now?
3473804 3474731 Alright.
3474997 3476080 Thanks.
3481937 3484288 There that's... That's it!<br />That's the wormhole!
3484329 3486122 Say it don't spray it Rom.
3486233 3487366 It's a sphere.
3487693 3489257 Of course it is. What you...
3489602 3491172 You thought it would just be a hole?
3492763 3496004 No it's just that all the illustrations<br />I have ever seen they...
3496359 3499184 The illustrations they are<br />trying to show you how it works.
3500289 3502362 So they say you want to go from here...
3503351 3504374 to there.
3504591 3506235 But it's too far right?
3507171 3509536 So a wormhole bends space like this,
3509684 3511546 so you can take a shortcut through...
3512105 3513327 a higher dimension.
3513872 3515163 Ok so...
3515846 3518680 to show that they ave turned<br />three-dimensional space
3518776 3522090 into two dimensions which turns<br />a wormhole into two dimensions...
3522399 3523477 a circle.
3524006 3525891 What's a circle in three dimensions?
3527524 3529101 A sphere.<br />Exactly.
3529317 3530508 A spherical hole.
3531486 3532726 But who put it there?
3532859 3534431 Who do we have to thank?
3534740 3538748 I am not thanking anybody until we get<br />out of here in one piece Rom.
3546225 3547742 Any trick to this Doyle?
3549379 3550639 No one knows.
3558180 3559675 The others made it right?
3561892 3563410 At least some of them.
3595509 3598678 Everybody ready to say goodbye<br />to our solar system?
3599554 3600955 To our galaxy.
3603475 3604517 Here we go.
3637078 3638414 The controls won't work here.
3638852 3640524 We are passing through the bulk.
3640749 3642673 It's space beyond our three dimensions.
3643039 3645110 All you can do is record and observe.
3656403 3657445 What is that?
3660034 3661430 I think it's them.
3661992 3663651 Distorting space-time.
3665912 3666996 Don't! Don't!
3694830 3696080 What was that?
3699153 3700348 The first handshake.
3702249 3703221 We are...
3705018 3706049 We are here.
3726807 3728943 So the lost communications came through.
3729108 3729827 How?
3730138 3731998 The relay on this side cached them.
3732270 3735268 So years of basic data. No real surprises.
3736533 3739714 Miller's site has kept pinging<br />thumbs up as has Dr. Mann's.
3740388 3742393 Edmunds' went down three years ago.
3743031 3744240 Transmitter failure?
3744408 3745229 Maybe.
3745253 3747398 He was sending the thumbs<br />up right until it went dark.
3747445 3749205 But Miller is still looks good though right?
3749816 3751709 Because she is coming up fast.
3752149 3753650 With one complication.
3754668 3757388 The planet is much closer<br />to Gargantua than we thought.
3757760 3758785 Gargantua?
3758930 3760604 It's what we are calling the black hole.
3760629 3762794 Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets<br />both orbit it.
3762835 3764958 And Miller's is on the horizon?
3764982 3766402 As a basketball around a hoop.
3766513 3768550 Landing there takes us dangerously close.
3768575 3771827 And a black hole that big has<br />a huge gravitational pull.
3774664 3777602 Look I could swing around that neutron<br />star to decelerate.
3777627 3779503 No it's not that. It's time.
3779663 3782545 The gravity on that planet will slow<br />our clock compared to Earth...
3783111 3784362 is drastically.
3784865 3785780 How bad?
3786199 3788843 Every hour we spend<br />on that planet will be...
3790510 3792678 seven years back on Earth.
3793665 3794507 Jesus.
3795041 3796709 Well that's relativity folks.
3798128 3800588 Well we can't just drop<br />down there without...
3800755 3802631 Cooper, we have a mission.
3802799 3805729 Yeah Doyle we have a mission<br />and our mission Plan A is...
3805754 3809182 to find a planet that can habitate the<br />people that are living on Earth right now.
3809207 3811847 You can't just think about your family.<br />Now you have to think bigger than that alright?
3811872 3815066 I am thinking about my family<br />and millions of other families ok?
3815099 3816484 Plan A does not work,
3816730 3819352 if the people on Earth<br />are dead by the time we pull it off.
3820668 3822067 No. It doesn't.
3822819 3824200 That's why there is a Plan B.
3826296 3827228 Ok.
3827252 3828206 Cooper is right.
3828231 3830793 We need to think about time as a resource<br />just like oxygen and food.
3830818 3832275 Going down there is going to cost us.
3834133 3835057 Alright look.
3836792 3838573 Dr. Mann's data is promising.
3838597 3840657 Right? But it's going<br />to take us months to get there.
3840782 3842532 And Edmunds' it's even further.
3842591 3845413 Now Miller has not sent much<br />but what she has is very promising.
3845437 3847068 It's water it's organics...
3847093 3849399 You don't find that every day.<br />No you don't.
3849429 3850942 And just think about the resources
3850967 3853927 including time that would be<br />spent trying to get back here.
3855560 3857053 Romilly.<br />Yeah?
3857121 3859674 How far off from Miller's planet do we have<br />to be,
3859698 3861393 to stay out of the time shift?
3861675 3863042 Well just back from the cusp.
3863439 3866198 Alright which is here,<br />just outside of Miller's planet.
3866223 3867737 Right.<br />Ok.
3869065 3870521 Here is Gargantua.
3870545 3871992 Here is Miller's planet.
3872507 3875526 Instead of taking the Endurance<br />into orbit around Miller's planet
3875551 3878180 which would conserve fuel<br />but we would lose a lot of time...
3878359 3879238 what if we...
3879383 3881717 take a wider<br />orbit around Gargantua
3881742 3885084 parallel with Miller's planet outside<br />of this time shift to here?
3885465 3887455 Then we take the Ranger down<br />we get Miller,
3887588 3888606 we get her samples.
3888631 3891248 We come back we analyze<br />we debrief. We are in we are out.
3891304 3893639 We lose a little fuel<br />but we save a whole lot of time.
3893707 3895641 That will work.<br />That's good.
3895666 3898314 There is not gonna be time for monkey<br />business or chit-chat down there.
3898339 3900714 TARS you should definitely stay here.
3901120 3903571 CASE, you are with me.<br />Anyone else can stay.
3903817 3905973 If we are talking about a couple of years,
3906370 3908024 I could use the time to research gravity.
3908049 3910631 Observations from the wormhole<br />that's gold to Professor Brand.
3910854 3912634 TARS factor an orbit of Gargantua.
3912737 3914940 Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting,
3915132 3917430 but make sure we stay<br />in range of Miller's planet.
3917455 3919507 You got it?<br />I would not leave you behind...
3920260 3921302 Dr. Brand.
3925880 3927345 You ready CASE?<br />Yup.
3928466 3929831 You don't say much do you?
3929964 3931915 TARS talks plenty for both of us.
3933179 3934173 Detach.
3941451 3943344 Romilly are you reading these forces?
3943368 3944569 <i>It's unbelievable.</i>
3947694 3949348 A literal heart of darkness.
3953992 3956702 If we could just see<br />the collapsed star inside...
3956870 3957984 the singularity,
3958234 3959848 yeah we would solve gravity.
3960040 3961663 And we can't get anything from it?
3961688 3963358 <i>Nothing escapes that horizon.</i>
3963501 3964588 Not even light.
3964831 3967065 <i>The answer is there, just no way to see it.</i>
3967446 3968666 There is Miller's planet.
3971176 3972509 Goodbye Ranger.
3985315 3987408 This is fast for atmospheric entry.
3987676 3989927 Should we use the thrusters to slow?<br />No.
3990487 3993822 I am gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics<br />to save some fuel.
3993990 3995122 Air brake?
3995367 3996844 We want to get down fast, don't we?
3996988 3998744 Actually we want to get<br />there in one piece.
3999079 4000130 Hang on.
4000455 4002206 Brand, Doyle, get ready.
4018331 4020532 We should ease!<br />Hands where I can see them CASE.
4020600 4023936 It's the only time I ever went down was when<br />a machine was easing at the wrong time.
4024104 4027322 A little caution...<br />Can get you killed just like reckless driving.
4027365 4029532 Cooper it's too damn fast!<br />I got this.
4034377 4036312 Should I disable the feedback?<br />No.
4036804 4038659 I need to feel the air.
4042422 4043422 Here we go.
4046584 4047781 It's just water!
4049379 4050664 The stuff of life.
4051339 4052628 Twelve hundred meters.
4052924 4054967 Do we have a fix on the beacon?<br />Got it!
4055135 4057355 Can you maneuver?<br />I will need to shave some speed.
4057929 4060556 I am gonna spiral down on top of it.<br />Everybody hang on!
4062976 4064017 Seven hundred.
4066146 4068147 On my cue CASE. On my cue.
4071651 4072868 Five hundred meters.
4082620 4083662 Fire!
4097218 4098379 Very graceful.
4098470 4099395 No.
4100180 4101335 But very...
4102015 4103018 efficient.
4104726 4105881 What are you waiting for?
4106010 4106935 Let's go!
4107103 4108839 Go, go, go, go, go!
4109224 4111137 Seven years per hour here.
4111161 4112417 Let's make it count!
4138802 4139776 This way.
4142889 4144338 About 200 meters.
4154150 4155579 The gravity is punishing.
4156736 4158696 Been floating through space too long?
4159030 4161009 One hundred and thirty percent<br />Earth gravity.
4161407 4163282 Come on. Come on.
4166037 4168461 There is nothing here.<br />Should be right here.
4170792 4171614 If the...
4172083 4174239 signal is coming from here, then...
4183329 4184356 Her beacon.
4192730 4193772 Wreckage.
4194440 4195607 <i>Where is the rest?</i>
4196109 4197384 Towards the mountains!
4201347 4202546 Those are not mountains.
4204851 4206077 They are waves.
4211624 4213114 Oh shit. Oh shit.
4213521 4214530 Shit.
4214794 4216795 <i>Now that one is moving away from us.</i>
4223203 4224508 We need the recorder.
4235148 4237399 Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!
4237567 4240944 We are not leaving without her data.
4241112 4242446 Get back here now!
4242614 4244178 <i>We do not have time!</i>
4244490 4247123 The second wave is coming!<br />We are in the middle of a swell.
4248244 4249265 No I got it.
4249829 4251830 Get your ass back to the Ranger now!
4256836 4258879 Brand get back here now!
4260840 4263152 No Cooper go. Cooper go.<br />I can't make it.
4263468 4265636 Go!<br />CASE go get her.
4270689 4271380 Go!
4271404 4272841 Get up. Get up Brand!
4273561 4274732 Go, go! Go!
4276648 4277761 I am not gonna make it!
4277786 4279685 Yes you are. Yes you are!
4286511 4289323 Come on CASE has her. CASE has her!<br />Get back here Doyle!
4291621 4292605 Come on!
4295358 4296482 Get to the hatch!
4301322 4302622 Go, go! Go!
4308471 4309554 Shit.
4310056 4311890 Manually overriding inside hatch!
4315395 4316707 Cooper! Wait!
4323803 4325309 The engines are flooded!
4325622 4327326 I am gonna have to shut her down.
4360924 4362011 Holy shit.
4366779 4367887 Hang on!
4399353 4400747 CASE what's the problem?
4400772 4402819 Too waterlogged. Let it drain.
4404317 4405525 Goddamn it!
4405693 4407766 I told you to leave me!<br />And I told you
4407790 4410130 Why didn't you leave me?<br />To get your ass back here!
4410531 4412778 The difference is one of us<br />was thinking about the mission!
4412803 4414703 Cooper you were<br />thinking about getting home.
4417038 4418921 I was trying to do the right thing!
4419540 4421069 Can you tell that to Doyle?
4423593 4424742 CASE how much time?
4424882 4426273 Forty-five to an hour.
4427757 4429091 The stuff of life?
4430009 4431562 What's this gonna cost us Brand?
4432345 4433334 A lot.
4433787 4434594 Decades.
4441806 4443139 What happened to Miller?
4443606 4444595 Judging by...
4445176 4446518 the wreckage she was,
4446574 4449152 broken up by a wave soon after impact.
4449538 4452066 How is the wreckage stayed together<br />after all these years?
4453407 4455193 Because of the time slippage.
4456481 4458108 On this planet's time she...
4458624 4460779 just landed hours ago, she...
4461958 4463864 She probably just died minutes ago.
4464502 4468043 The data Doyle received was just<br />the initial status, echoing endlessly.
4468923 4470715 Oh we are not prepared for this.
4473469 4476795 You eggheads have the survival<br />skills of a Boy Scout troop.
4477098 4478792 Well we got this far on our brains.
4478816 4480350 Farther than any human in history.
4480518 4481802 Well not far enough!
4482436 4483842 And now we are stuck here,
4483866 4485939 untill there won't be<br />anyone left on Earth to save.
4488985 4491420 I am counting every minute<br />same as you Cooper.
4496450 4497815 Is there any possibility,
4498193 4499545 I don't know some...
4499701 4501235 some kind of a way we can maybe<br />all jump...
4501545 4503466 in a black hole.<br />Gain back the years?
4504584 4506084 Don't shake your head at me.
4506252 4508253 Time is relative, ok?
4508399 4510953 It can stretch and it can squeeze but...
4511966 4513247 it can't run backwards.
4513664 4515874 It just can't.<br />The only thing that can move,
4515898 4517511 across dimensions like time,
4517535 4518763 is gravity.
4521475 4522272 Ok.
4524564 4526427 The beings that led us here,
4527064 4528441 they communicate...
4528649 4530501 through gravity right?<br />Yes.
4531007 4532845 Could they be talking<br />to us from the future?
4533738 4535989 Maybe.<br />Ok. If they can...
4537200 4537813 They...
4538363 4540277 are beings of five dimensions.
4540870 4544206 To them time might be<br />another physical dimension.
4544540 4545325 To them...
4546292 4550462 the past might be a canyon that they can<br />climb into and the future...
4550487 4552286 a mountain they can climb up.<br />But to us...
4552450 4553629 it's not ok?
4554717 4556165 Look Cooper I screwed up.
4556571 4557745 I am sorry.
4559422 4561158 But you knew about relativity.
4564268 4565018 Brand...
4570316 4571768 My daughter was 10 years old.
4572860 4575265 I could not teach her<br />Einstein's theories before I left.
4576283 4578397 Could not you have told her you<br />were going to save the world?
4579492 4580233 No.
4582203 4583442 When you become a parent,
4584169 4585827 one thing becomes really clear.
4587875 4590343 And that is that you want to make<br />sure your children feel safe.
4592088 4594119 And it rules out telling a 10-year-old,
4594143 4595648 that the world is ended.
4598202 4599096 Cooper?
4603391 4604880 How long for the engines CASE?
4604904 4606757 A minute or two.<br />But we don't have it.
4607164 4608534 Helmets on!
4612066 4613858 Brand co-pilot you are up.
4613883 4616604 CASE blow the cabin oxygen<br />through the main thrusters!
4616758 4618467 We are gonna spark it.<br />Roger that.
4618698 4620236 Locked.<br />Depressurizing.
4625913 4627163 Engines up!
4656027 4656941 Hello Rom.
4657987 4659316 I have waited years.
4660740 4662254 How? How many years?
4664410 4665774 By now it must be...
4665798 4667251 Twenty-three years...
4667538 4669071 four months eight days.
4673669 4674602 Doyle?
4681052 4684054 I thought I was prepared.<br />I knew the theory.
4685431 4686931 Reality is different.
4687975 4688994 And Miller?
4690728 4692166 There is nothing here for us.
4695483 4696983 Why didn't you sleep?
4697943 4699766 Oh I had a couple of stretches.
4700624 4702299 But I stopped believing<br />you were coming back.
4702772 4705054 And something seemed wrong<br />about dreaming my life away.
4706213 4708738 I learned what I could<br />from the black hole...
4709580 4711684 but I could not send<br />anything to your father.
4712208 4714113 We have been receiving<br />but nothing gets out.
4714642 4715766 Is he alive?
4715790 4716726 Oh yeah.
4717081 4718674 Yeah?<br />Yeah.
4721926 4724433 We have got years of messages stored.
4725221 4726152 Cooper.
4726555 4729557 Messages span 23 years.
4731656 4733107 Play it from the beginning.
4736315 4737275 <i>Hey Dad.</i>
4738859 4740916 <i>Checking in. Saying hi.</i>

4747550 4749593 <i>Miss Kurling is still giving me C's though.</i>
4750121 4752538 <i>Pulled me down but second is not bad.</i>
4754125 4755712 <i>Grandpa attended the ceremony.</i>
4760959 4762275 <i>I met another girl Dad.</i>
4763008 4763892 <i>I...</i>
4765344 4767025 <i>I really think this is the one.</i>
4768639 4769711 <i>Name is Lois.</i>
4769836 4770994 <i>That's her right there.</i>
4774270 4775913 <i>Murphy stole Grandpa's car.</i>
4777071 4778136 <i>She crashed it.</i>
4778308 4779468 <i>She is ok though.</i>
4780276 4781359 <i>Hey Dad.</i>
4782278 4783468 <i>Look at this!</i>
4784447 4785769 <i>You are a grandpa.</i>
4787389 4788769 <i>His name is Jesse.</i>
4789702 4792609 <i>I kind of wanted to call him Coop<br />but Lois says...</i>
4793434 4794605 <i>maybe next time.</i>
4795104 4797627 <i>Donald says he is already<br />earned the great part so...</i>
4797802 4799252 <i>we just leave it at that.</i>
4802548 4804340 <i>Oh dear. Oh dear.</i>
4805134 4806759 Say Bye-bye Grandpa.
4807136 4809152 <i>Bye-bye Grandpa. Ok.</i>
4809388 4810902 <i>Sorry it's been a while.</i>
4813267 4814191 <i>Just...</i>
4816520 4818096 <i>what with Jesse and all.</i>
4825029 4826845 <i>Grandpa died last week.</i>
4827781 4830867 <i>We buried him out in the back<br />forty next to Mom and...</i>
4831744 4832649 <i>Jesse.</i>
4833891 4836553 <i>Which is where we would have<br />buried you if you would ever...</i>
4837706 4838717 <i>come back.</i>
4840544 4842451 <i>Murph was there at the funeral.</i>
4843422 4846174 <i>We don't see her that much<br />but she came for that.</i>
4849494 4851627 <i>You are not listening to this I know that.</i>
4854934 4857085 <i>All these messages are just like...</i>
4858854 4859885 <i>drifting...</i>
4860696 4862391 <i>out there in the darkness.</i>
4863609 4865540 <i>Lois says that...</i>
4866737 4867768 <i>I have to...</i>
4868143 4869244 <i>let you go.</i>
4869865 4870893 <i>And...</i>
4872101 4872885 <i>so...</i>
4876617 4877527 <i>I guess...</i>
4878863 4879902 <i>I am letting you go.</i>
4880662 4882809 <i>I don't know wherever you are Dad but...</i>
4883779 4885810 <i>I hope that you are at peace and...</i>
4888432 4889427 <i>Goodbye.</i>
4902966 4904044 <i>Hey Dad.</i>
4907069 4908236 Hey Murph.
4908404 4909935 <i>You son of a bitch.</i>
4914366 4916812 <i>I never made one of these when<br />you were still responding...</i>
4916837 4918702 <i>because I was so mad at you for leaving.</i>
4922084 4923973 <i>And then when you went quiet it...</i>
4926922 4929356 <i>seemed like I should live<br />with that decision. And I have.</i>
4934138 4936067 <i>But today is my birthday.</i>
4940227 4942958 <i>And it's a special one<br />because you told me...</i>
4947620 4951427 <i>You once told me that when you came<br />back we might be the same age.</i>
4953675 4956236 <i>And today I am the age<br />you were when you left.</i>
4959436 4962221 <i>So it would be a real good<br />time for you to come back.</i>
4976221 4978013 I didn't mean to intrude.
4978438 4981040 It's just that I have never<br />seen you in here before.
4981143 4982997 I have never been in here before.
4985189 4986511 I talk to Amelia,
4986970 4988191 all the time.
4988692 4989681 It helps.
4990694 4992058 I am glad you have started.
4992082 4993446 I have not.<br />I...
4993723 4995425 just had something I needed to get out.
4996450 4997939 I know they are still out there.
4997963 4998868 I know.
4999036 5001568 There are so many reasons<br />their communications,
5002036 5003465 might not be getting through.
5003615 5004832 I know professor.
5005459 5006489 I am not sure,
5007348 5008764 what I am more afraid of.
5009546 5011647 Them never coming back or...
5013053 5014039 coming back...
5014873 5016263 to find we have failed.
5016470 5017887 Then let's succeed.
5018931 5019582 So...
5020683 5022797 back, to the fourth iteration.
5022821 5024761 Let's run it through some new fields.
5024941 5026551 With respect professor,
5026575 5028238 we have tried that hundreds of times.
5028441 5030805 It only has to work once...
5031391 5032363 Murph.
5035379 5037646 Every rivet, that they strike,
5037670 5038966 could have been a bullet.
5039363 5041364 We have done well for the world here
5041479 5044110 whether or not, we crack the equation,
5044321 5046095 before I kick the bucket.
5046625 5048240 Don't be morbid professor.
5048264 5049702 I am not afraid of death.
5050254 5051504 I am an old physicist.
5053340 5055043 I am afraid of time.
5062182 5063142 Time.
5065572 5067095 You are afraid of time.
5069648 5071608 Figures we have been trying<br />to solve the equation
5071617 5074218 without changing the underlying<br />assumption about time.
5074619 5076328 And?<br />And that means...
5076363 5078186 each iteration is an attempt to...
5078311 5080264 prove its own proof.<br />It's...
5081014 5083044 recursive it's nonsensical.
5083412 5085360 Are you calling my life's work,
5085461 5087122 nonsense Murph?
5087374 5089138 No I am saying<br />that you have been trying to...
5089163 5090865 finish it with one arm, no with...
5090889 5092857 both arms tied behind your back.
5095466 5097182 And I don't understand why.
5098427 5099737 I am an old man Murph.
5101180 5103506 Can we take this point up at another time?
5103974 5105593 I want to talk to my daughter.
5108270 5110367 <i>Stepping out into the universe...</i>
5110898 5112762 <i>we must confront the reality</i>
5113078 5114958 <i>of interstellar travel.</i>
5115611 5117017 <i>We must reach,</i>
5117216 5119872 <i>far beyond our own lifespans.</i>
5120324 5121646 <i>We must think not,</i>
5121817 5123106 <i>as individuals,</i>
5123755 5125260 <i>but as a species.</i>
5128290 5131417 <i>Do not go gentle into that good night.</i>
5133086 5134534 TARS kept the Endurance,
5134558 5135813 right where we needed her.
5135839 5138274 But the trip took years<br />longer than we anticipated.
5138967 5141836 We no longer have the fuel<br />to visit both prospects so...
5142805 5143954 we have to choose.
5145516 5146412 But how?
5147584 5148841 They are both promising.
5150809 5155162 Edmunds' data is better but Dr. Mann<br />is the one still transmitting so...
5155567 5158112 We have no reason to suspect<br />Edmunds' data would have soured.
5159597 5161906 His world has key elements<br />to sustain human life.
5162074 5163479 As does Dr. Mann's.
5163567 5164909 Cooper this is my field.
5166411 5167453 And...
5168555 5170514 I really believe Edmunds'<br />is the better prospect.
5170539 5171028 Why?
5171790 5173445 Gargantua, that's why.
5175045 5176159 Look at Miller's planet.
5176750 5178610 Hydrocarbons organics yes...
5179258 5180288 but no life.
5180655 5181498 Sterile.
5182508 5183805 We will find the same thing on Mann's.
5184096 5185454 Because of the black hole?
5186056 5187003 Murphy's Law.
5187120 5188841 Whatever can happen will happen.
5189268 5191745 Accident is the first<br />building block of evolution.
5191770 5194927 But when you are orbiting a black<br />hole not enough can happen.
5194952 5197072 It sucks in asteroids and comets,
5197466 5199247 other events which would<br />otherwise reach you.
5199444 5200941 We need to go further afield.
5201905 5203723 You once said that Dr. Mann...
5205687 5207043 was the best of us.
5207348 5208525 He is remarkable.
5208926 5210516 We are only here because of him.
5210998 5212551 And yet yet here he is.
5213000 5213988 He is on the ground,
5214660 5217862 and he is sending a very unambiguous<br />message telling us...
5217930 5219639 to come to his planet.
5220007 5221579 Granted but...
5221720 5222956 Edmunds' data,
5223361 5224835 is more promising.
5225095 5226137 We should vote.
5226305 5228825 Well if we are going to vote<br />there is something you should know.
5229600 5230341 Brand?
5231082 5232484 He has a right to know.
5233195 5234729 That has nothing to do with it.
5234897 5235760 What does?
5236252 5237913 She is in love with Wolf Edmunds.
5238108 5238972 Is that true?
5239585 5240358 Yes.
5243822 5245932 And that makes me want to follow my heart.
5249995 5253520 But maybe we have spent too long trying<br />to figure all this out with theory.
5253637 5255262 You are a scientist Brand.
5255323 5256504 So listen to me...
5257691 5258867 when I say that...
5259031 5262001 love isn't something we invented. It's...
5263429 5265173 observable powerful.
5267930 5269273 It has to mean something.
5269465 5271212 Love has meaning yes.
5271236 5274085 Social utility, social bonding,<br />child rearing.
5274110 5275550 We love people who have died.
5276054 5277812 Where is the social utility in that?
5278598 5279395 None.
5279608 5282895 Maybe it means something<br />more something we can't...
5283481 5284184 yet...
5284567 5285638 understand.
5285730 5286853 Maybe it's...
5287419 5289191 some evidence, some...
5290285 5291524 artifact of,
5291548 5294424 a higher dimension that<br />we can't consciously perceive.
5294915 5295570 I am...
5295800 5299456 drawn across the universe to someone<br />I have not seen in a decade...
5299878 5300700 who I know...
5301028 5302271 is probably dead.
5302962 5306496 Love, is the one thing we are<br />capable of perceiving,
5306521 5308888 that transcends dimensions<br />of time and space.
5311223 5314846 Maybe we should trust that<br />even if we can't understand it yet.
5320565 5321696 Alright Cooper...
5324111 5324970 yes...
5326571 5329610 the tiniest possibility of seeing<br />Wolf again excites me.
5330742 5331990 That doesn't mean I am wrong.
5333120 5334475 Honestly Amelia...
5337082 5338115 it might.
5345048 5347449 TARS chart a course for Dr. Mann's.
5364651 5366110 We will lose about a third again.
5366278 5367633 But next year...
5370115 5372950 Next year I am gonna work<br />Nelson's farm and we will make it up.
5373785 5375119 What happened to Nelson?
5381543 5383842 Murph have you eaten enough<br />or would you like some more soufflé?
5383867 5384522 Oh no.
5384651 5386613 I am full thanks.<br />It was delicious.
5388002 5389699 Coop finish your fritter please.
5392345 5393589 Will you spend the night?
5394024 5395718 Your room is exactly as you left it.
5395742 5397415 It's ready.<br />I need to get back.
5397752 5399642 My sewing machine<br />is in there but there is plenty...
5399667 5401110 I need to...
5404649 5405781 Too many memories.
5406818 5408141 We might have something for that.
5408577 5409539 Hey Coop.
5417162 5418107 The dust.
5420957 5423052 Lois, I have a friend who...
5424033 5425127 could look at his lungs.
5443897 5446272 Amelia I am sorry.<br />You were just being objective.
5446358 5447805 Unless you are punishing me,
5447829 5449647 for screwing up on Miller's planet.
5449925 5452464 No this was not a personal decision.<br />Well.
5453215 5456464 If you are wrong you will have<br />a very personal decision to make.
5457082 5460358 Your fuel calculations<br />are based on a return journey.
5460744 5464622 Strike out on Mann's planet and we will have<br />to decide whether to return home...
5464751 5467061 or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.
5467212 5468618 Starting a colony,
5468930 5470881 could save us from extinction.
5471524 5474385 You might have to decide<br />between seeing your children again...
5474748 5476383 and the future of the human race.
5477711 5479213 I trust you will be as objective then.
5486481 5488399 He has been asking<br />for you since he came to.
5488769 5490140 We were trying to reach you.
5496458 5497398 Murph.
5498201 5499305 I am here professor.
5500112 5502320 I let you all down.
5502932 5504487 No you got us so far.
5504987 5506117 Real close.
5508253 5509711 I will finish what you started.
5510213 5511742 Good, good Murph.
5514718 5516508 You had faith...
5518221 5519513 all those...
5520473 5521599 all those years.
5523786 5524763 I...
5525353 5527855 I asked you to have faith.
5529608 5531601 I wanted you to believe...
5533771 5535170 that your father...
5538783 5539859 would come back.
5540785 5542177 I do professor.
5543517 5545018 Forgive me Murph.
5545816 5547633 There is nothing to forgive.
5550824 5551536 I...
5552082 5553521 I lied Murph.
5556303 5557669 I lied to you.
5564507 5567174 There was no need for him...
5569022 5570298 To come back.
5573383 5574265 There is...
5574828 5576672 no way to help us.
5578027 5579069 But Plan A...
5579699 5580605 All this.
5581308 5582808 All these people.
5583883 5585675 And the equation.
5589751 5591107 Did my father know?
5595298 5596607 Did he leave me?
5600971 5601940 Do...
5603181 5604268 not...
5605475 5606307 go...
5607936 5609221 gentle...
5611523 5612352 No.
5614210 5614962 No!
5616653 5618040 You can't leave.
5618595 5619845 You... No.
5621032 5623920 Dr. Brand I am sorry to tell you<br />that your father died today.
5624560 5625727 He had no pain.
5626288 5627420 He was at peace.
5628498 5630240 I am very sorry for your loss.
5643305 5644665 Brand did you know?
5647392 5648685 <i>He told you right?</i>
5651938 5653029 <i>You knew.</i>
5655233 5656572 <i>This was all a sham.</i>
5661406 5662775 <i>You left us here.</i>
5665243 5666180 <i>To suffocate.</i>
5668913 5669883 <i>To starve.</i>
5697609 5698704 Frozen cloud.
5843379 5844244 It's ok.
5844923 5845947 It's ok.
5853181 5854078 It's ok.
5860104 5861525 Pray you never learn...
5863274 5864638 just how good it can be,
5864716 5866104 to see another face.
5875036 5877066 I had not a lot of hope to begin with but...
5877705 5879598 after so long I had none.
5881499 5883768 My supplies were completely exhausted.
5886506 5889697 The last time I went to sleep<br />I didn't even set a waking date.
5893972 5896289 You have literally<br />raised me from the dead.
5897600 5898757 Lazarus.
5900687 5901801 What about the others?
5902254 5903794 I am afraid you are it sir.
5904649 5905554 So far...
5905976 5906934 surely.
5907819 5909558 No our present situation,
5909582 5912656 is that there is very little chance<br />of rescuing any others.
5916411 5917483 Dr. Mann.
5917881 5918994 Dr. Mann?
5919497 5920955 Tell us about your world.
5924669 5926288 Our world we hope.
5930341 5931705 Our world...
5931729 5932676 is cold...
5932844 5933841 stark...
5936014 5937513 but undeniably beautiful.
5940101 5942936 The days are 67 hours long, cold.
5947758 5948866 The nights are...
5949277 5951040 67 far colder hours.
5957452 5958732 The gravity is a very,
5959071 5961611 very pleasant 80 percent of the Earth's.
5961956 5963863 Now up here where I landed<br />the water is...
5964197 5965118 alkali...
5965316 5967189 and the air has too much ammonia in it
5967214 5968995 to breathe for more<br />than just a few minutes but...
5969127 5970452 down at the surface,
5971456 5973456 and there is a surface...
5973868 5975024 the chlorine dissipates.
5975762 5977960 The ammonia gives way to crystalline<br />hydrocarbons,
5977985 5979446 and breathable air.
5979817 5981118 To organics.
5981809 5983805 Possibly even to life.
5984979 5986498 We might be sharing this world.
5987440 5989193 These readings are from the surface?
5989218 5990180 Over the years,
5990539 5992631 I have dropped various probes.
5993000 5994252 How far have you explored?
5994724 5996514 I have mounted several major expeditions.
5996601 6000190 But with oxygen in limited supply KIPP<br />there really did most of the legwork.
6000779 6002234 What went wrong with him sir?
6002258 6003401 Degeneration.
6003706 6006792 He misidentified the first organics<br />we found as ammonia crystals.
6007460 6008949 We struggled on for a time but...
6009430 6011414 ultimately I decommissioned him and...
6011756 6013821 used his power source<br />to keep the mission going.
6014234 6016436 I thought I was alone<br />before I shut him down.
6017128 6018537 Would you like me to look at him?
6019328 6021630 No. No. He needs a human touch.
6021906 6025857 Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message<br />for you from the comm station.
6026437 6028433 Ok. Be right there. Excuse me.
6041011 6043596 <i>Dr. Brand I am sorry to tell you<br />that your father died today.</i>
6044205 6045423 <i>He had no pain.</i>
6048960 6050256 <i>He was at peace.</i>
6052547 6053998 <i>I am sorry for your loss.</i>
6056930 6057972 Is that Murph?
6058401 6059333 She is...
6060073 6061114 She is grown.
6061139 6062370 <i>Brand did you know?</i>
6063891 6065206 <i>He told you right?</i>
6068604 6069591 <i>You knew.</i>
6071805 6073306 <i>This was all a sham.</i>
6074193 6075536 <i>You left us here.</i>
6077989 6079057 <i>To suffocate.</i>
6081576 6082775 <i>To starve.</i>
6086289 6087873 <i>Did my father know too?</i>
6090460 6091452 <i>Dad?</i>
6093671 6095273 <i>I just want to know...</i>
6096924 6098925 <i>if you left me here to die.</i>
6101512 6103294 <i>I just have to know.</i>
6109020 6110262 Cooper my...
6111939 6113598 My father dedicated...
6114233 6115514 his whole life,
6115538 6116682 to Plan A. I have...
6117002 6119070 no idea what she is talking about.
6120948 6121914 I do.
6127294 6130263 He never even hoped to get<br />the people off the Earth?
6131125 6131966 No.
6132841 6133537 But...
6136380 6139676 But he has been trying to solve<br />the gravity equation for 40 years.
6140881 6144192 Amelia your father solved<br />his equation before I even left.
6144865 6146592 Then why would not he use it?
6146766 6149965 The equation could not reconcile relativity<br />with quantum mechanics.
6150109 6151592 You need more.<br />More?
6151616 6152749 More what?
6152980 6153927 More data.
6154094 6155827 You need to see into a black hole.
6156150 6158571 The laws of nature prohibit<br />a naked singularity.
6158666 6159946 Romilly is that true?
6161306 6164907 If a black hole is an oyster then<br />the singularity is the pearl inside.
6165076 6169089 The gravity is so strong, it's always<br />hidden in darkness behind the horizon.
6170975 6172761 That's why we call it a black hole.
6173084 6174139 Ok but...
6175064 6177027 if we see beyond the horizon.
6177431 6178602 We can't Coop.
6178888 6180992 There are some things<br />that are not meant to be known.
6181592 6183467 Your father had to find another way,
6183564 6185875 to save the human race from extinction.
6185900 6187295 Plan B. A colony.
6187579 6188732 Why not tell people?
6190858 6193812 Why keep building those stations?<br />Because he knew how hard it would be
6193820 6195302 to get people to work together,
6195466 6197413 to save the species instead of themselves.
6198419 6199444 Or their children.
6199610 6200563 Bullshit.
6200820 6203613 You never would have come here unless<br />you believed you were gonna save them.
6203899 6206492 Evolution has yet to transcend<br />that simple barrier.
6206517 6209061 We can care deeply, selflessly
6209204 6210588 about those we know...
6210802 6213327 but that empathy rarely extends<br />beyond our line of sight.
6213457 6214757 But the lie.
6218696 6220374 That monstrous lie?
6221969 6223051 Unforgivable.
6223593 6224715 And he knew that.
6225803 6228043 He was prepared to destroy<br />his own humanity,
6228895 6230239 in order to save the species.
6230240 6232259 He made an incredible sacrifice.<br />No.
6234145 6236135 An incredible sacrifice is being made,
6236385 6237719 by the people on Earth,
6237876 6239142 who are gonna die!
6239483 6241283 Because in his fucking arrogance...
6242069 6243788 he declared their case hopeless.
6244822 6245999 I am sorry Cooper...
6246866 6249064 their case is hopeless.<br />No.
6249866 6250619 No.
6251128 6252444 We are the future.
6256417 6257762 Cooper what can I do?
6261547 6262762 Let me go home.
6263966 6265884 You are absolutely positive?
6266510 6269012 His solution was correct.<br />He would had it for years.
6269680 6270711 It's worthless?
6270984 6272338 It's half the answer.
6273267 6273881 Ok.
6274696 6276462 How do you find the other half?
6276854 6278521 Out there? A black hole.
6278689 6280262 But stuck down here on Earth?
6280509 6281110 Yeah?
6282860 6284237 I am not sure you can.
6286447 6288768 God they just pack up and leave.
6290534 6292253 What are they hoping to find?
6293204 6294245 Survival.
6301846 6302831 Damn it.
6306050 6306788 Murph...
6307235 6307956 don't...
6308649 6310039 Don't people have a right to know?
6310532 6311915 Panic won't help.
6312250 6314484 We just have to keep<br />working same as ever.
6314725 6315547 Yeah but...
6315921 6317961 isn't that exactly what Professor Brand<br />was manipulating us to do?
6318029 6319259 Brand gave up on us.
6319470 6321015 I am still trying to solve this.
6322108 6322847 So...
6324665 6325932 do you have an idea?
6326988 6327940 A feeling.
6331542 6332977 I told you about my ghost.
6335746 6337555 My dad thought I called it a ghost...
6338049 6339453 because I was scared of it.
6343379 6344811 But I was never scared of it.
6346806 6348991 I called it a ghost because it felt...
6352013 6353380 It felt like a person.
6356502 6358169 It was trying to tell me something.
6360862 6362476 If there is an answer here on Earth,
6362500 6363777 it's back there...
6364182 6365759 somehow in that room.
6366777 6368063 So I have to find it.
6371949 6373345 We are running out of time.
6375619 6377620 What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?
6377788 6378860 No they can stay CASE.
6378884 6380779 I will be sleeping most of the way anyway.<br />Hey Coop?
6380803 6381569 Yeah?
6381876 6383983 I have a suggestion<br />for your return journey.
6384045 6385033 Yeah what's that?
6385057 6386896 Have one last crack at the black hole.
6388674 6389844 I am going home Rom.
6389930 6390891 Yeah I know.
6391414 6393375 This isn't going to cost you any time.
6394702 6396282 There is a chance for the people on Earth.
6396930 6399679 Talk to me.<br />Gargantua is an older spinning black hole.
6400227 6401258 It's what we call a...
6401445 6402968 a gentle singularity.
6403226 6404148 Gentle?
6404173 6405470 They are hardly gentle.
6405494 6407449 But the tidal gravity is so quick that...
6407702 6409682 something crossing the horizon fast,
6409863 6410934 might survive.
6411308 6412355 A probe say.
6412440 6413812 What happens after it crosses?
6413836 6417110 After the horizon is a complete mystery.
6417304 6418150 So...
6418174 6420389 what's to say there isn't<br />some way that the probe
6420414 6423010 can glimpse the singularity<br />and relay the quantum data?
6423501 6426854 If he is equipped to transmit<br />every form of energy that can pulse.
6426922 6429789 Just when did this probe<br />become a he professor?
6430343 6432094 TARS is the obvious candidate.
6432843 6434761 I have already told him what to look for.
6434929 6437491 I will need the old optical<br />transmitter off KIPP Cooper.
6437807 6439140 You would do this for us?
6439308 6441780 Before you get all teary try to remember<br />that as a robot,
6441804 6443284 I have to do anything you say.
6444146 6445518 Your cue light is broken.
6445673 6446776 I am not joking.
6449944 6453196 I will need TARS to remove and adapt<br />some components from KIPP.
6453364 6455865 I don't want to disturb<br />his archival functions.
6455890 6457091 I will supervise.
6457701 6458559 Alright.
6458911 6461026 Dr. Mann we need to find<br />three secure sites.
6461676 6464059 One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.
6464084 6466352 Once those modules have landed<br />you don't want to move them.
6466377 6468826 Well I can take you to the probe sites<br />but I don't think this...
6469231 6471576 these conditions are gonna hold.<br />I think we should wait.
6471966 6474801 CASE is headed back down with the rest<br />of the distillery equipment.
6474969 6477558 I would really like to secure<br />those sites by nightfall.
6479723 6480378 Well...
6481144 6482941 these squalls do usually blow over.
6483227 6484126 Ok then.
6484520 6486840 But you are gonna need a long range transmitter.<br />Got it.
6486897 6488204 Are you charged?<br />Yeah.
6488883 6489925 Follow me.
6490688 6491431 TARS.
6491860 6493170 72 hours yeah?
6493195 6494404 Roger that Cooper.
6500703 6503295 Brand told me why you feel<br />you have to go back.
6505383 6507864 But I would be remiss if I didn't<br />at least mention that...
6508504 6510867 a mission such as ours could certainly use...
6511304 6512664 an extra engineer.
6514419 6516260 You better slow down Turbo.
6517170 6519272 Safety first CASE remember.
6519355 6520928 Safety first Cooper.
6522558 6525560 I have to tell you Dr. Mann<br />I am honored to be a part of this.
6525736 6527509 But once we set up base camp,
6528194 6529302 and secure those modules,
6529326 6530740 my work is done here.
6531358 6532311 I am going home.
6540701 6542065 You have attachments.
6542614 6544302 But even without a family I can...
6544622 6545652 promise you that...
6545934 6548028 that yearning to be with other people...
6548286 6549341 is powerful.
6549752 6550782 That emotion is...
6551559 6553087 at the foundation...
6553756 6555245 of what makes us human.
6555269 6556799 It's not to be taken lightly.
6564808 6566423 How long have you had that cough?
6566447 6567496 A while.
6577947 6579501 Mom lets me play in here.
6581484 6582734 I don't touch your stuff.
6614024 6615408 Just take this gently.
6620781 6624158 You know why we could not just send machines<br />on these missions don't you Cooper?
6624785 6626816 A machine doesn't improvise well,
6626840 6629121 because you can't program a fear of death.
6630434 6632768 Our survival instinct is our single greatest...
6632793 6634115 source of inspiration.
6634606 6636020 Take you for example.
6637047 6638199 A father...
6639006 6640413 with a survival instinct,
6640703 6642274 that extends to your kids.
6643053 6644459 What does research tell us,
6644873 6647376 is the last thing you are going<br />to see before you die?
6649435 6650382 Your children.
6651311 6652350 Their faces.
6652530 6653788 At the moment of death
6653861 6656101 your mind is gonna push<br />a little bit harder to survive.
6657401 6658350 For them.
6659320 6660226 Deep breath.
6662865 6664377 Hey. I bet you are Coop.
6664402 6666491 Why don't you have a seat here for me?
6666910 6668878 It's bad. They cannot stay here.
6669955 6671247 Ok?<br />Yeah.
6679590 6681049 TARS what's taking so long?
6681074 6683771 Professor I am having<br />trouble completing the boot up.
6684104 6685341 I don't understand.
6692603 6693621 It's funny.
6695939 6697165 When I left Earth...
6698567 6700321 I thought I was prepared to die.
6702696 6703829 The truth is...
6706241 6707355 I never really...
6707753 6710756 considered the possibility<br />that my planet was not the one.
6713957 6715957 Nothing worked out the way<br />it was supposed to.
6716283 6717110 Let's go.
6725969 6728662 Alright hey buddy why don't you<br />give me a big deep breath.
6733560 6734793 What is this?
6735396 6737135 What are you doing?<br />I am sorry!
6737385 6739199 I can't let you leave with that ship.
6739276 6740430 We are gonna need it
6740556 6741855 to complete the mission...
6742102 6743183 once the others,
6743371 6745685 realize what this place isn't.
6745948 6747312 We cannot survive here.
6747516 6748681 I am sorry!
6749159 6750201 I am sorry!
6759962 6761247 They can't stay here anymore.
6761271 6762928 You have to leave right now.
6762986 6765080 Ok let me let me make something<br />abundantly clear.
6765104 6766462 You have a responsibility...
6766487 6767857 Oh! Jesus!
6768069 6769697 Coop get her stuff. She is going home.
6770533 6772450 Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb Tom!
6772516 6774223 Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did.
6774248 6776391 And he is buried out back<br />with Mom and Jesse.
6777187 6779345 You faked, all the data?
6781293 6782236 Yes.
6786655 6787963 There is no surface?
6788150 6789119 No.
6790659 6792367 I tried to do my duty Cooper...
6792628 6793525 but I knew...
6794289 6795812 the day that I arrived here that...
6796296 6797852 this place had nothing.
6798349 6799572 And I resisted,
6800033 6801882 the temptation for years...
6802880 6803618 but...
6803952 6805075 I knew that...
6805299 6806496 if I just pressed that...
6807059 6808134 button then...
6808505 6810088 somebody would come and save me.
6811472 6813111 You fucking coward.
6813947 6814849 Yes.
6819999 6820824 Yes.
6823045 6823894 Yes.
6825427 6826118 Yes.
6838081 6840823 Listen if you are not going to go<br />let your family go.
6840847 6842651 Just let save your family.
6843128 6844576 And go live underground...
6844875 6845696 with you?
6845721 6847549 Pray that Daddy comes to save us?
6847574 6848788 Dad's not coming back.
6848812 6850248 He never was coming back.
6850646 6851751 It's up to me.
6851776 6853169 You are gonna save everybody?
6853597 6856432 Because Dad could not do it.<br />Dad didn't even try!
6856600 6858387 Dad just abandoned us!
6859520 6861090 He left us here to die.
6862217 6863505 Nobody is going with you.
6867464 6869653 You gonna wait for your next kid to die?

6894363 6895300 Stop it!
6898642 6900226 No. No!
6901311 6904188 Dr. Mann there is a 50-50 chance<br />you are gonna kill yourself!
6905155 6907156 Those are the best odds I have had in years.
6927462 6928954 Don't judge me Cooper.

6932926 6934385 Few men have been.
6942928 6944094 You tried your best Murph.

6956450 6957932 The survival instinct.

7899767 7901672 CASE take the stick.<br />Roger that.
7951427 7952224 Cooper,
7952513 7954027 we are slipping towards Gargantua.
7955097 7956483 Shall I use main engines?
7957254 7958054 No.
7958751 7960780 We got to let her slide as far as we can.
7970004 7970913 Give it to me.
7971148 7972968 There is good news<br />there is bad news Cooper.
7973049 7974640 Yeah I have heard that one TARS.
7975610 7976851 Give it to me straight.
7985419 7987801 The backup generator kicked in so<br />the system is stable.
7987825 7989278 They are all good.<br />Good.
7990258 7990971 Ok.
7991609 7993898 The navigational hub has<br />been completely destroyed.
7994004 7996711 We don't have enough life support<br />to make it back to Earth but...
7996989 7999074 I think we can scratch our way<br />to Edmunds' planet.
7999241 8000575 What about fuel?
8000893 8001799 Not enough.
8002415 8003619 But I have a plan.
8004026 8006028 We let... Gargantua...
8006221 8008029 pull us down close to her horizon.
8008512 8011921 Then a powered slingshot around<br />launching us towards Edmunds' planet.
8011946 8012951 Manually?
8012975 8014447 That's what I am here for.
8014489 8016660 I am gonna take us just<br />inside the critical orbit.
8017205 8018404 What about the time slippage?
8018699 8022004 Neither one of us has time to worry<br />about relativity right now Dr. Brand.
8026460 8027653 I am sorry Cooper.
8030990 8033681 Once we have gathered<br />enough speed around Gargantua...
8034777 8036259 we use Lander 1...
8037113 8039506 and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...
8040174 8042175 push us out of the black hole's gravity.
8044812 8047069 <i>The Lander's linkages<br />have been destroyed...</i>
8047748 8049591 <i>so we will have to control manually.</i>
8051293 8053888 Once Lander 1 is spent TARS will detach...
8054722 8056431 And get sucked right into that black hole.
8057258 8058717 Why does TARS have to detach?
8058785 8061128 Well we have to shed the weight<br />to escape the gravity.

8063139 8066115 <i>The only way humans have ever<br />figured out of getting somewhere</i>
8066140 8067464 <i>is to leave something behind.</i>
8067727 8068590 Cooper,
8068945 8070523 you can't ask TARS to do this for us.
8070775 8072010 He is a robot.
8072406 8074484 So you don't have<br />to ask him to do anything.
8074942 8076234 <i>Cooper you asshole!</i>
8076610 8078235 Sorry you broke up a little bit there.
8078863 8080782 It's what we intended Dr. Brand.
8081449 8084032 It's our only chance<br />to save people on Earth.

8649675 8651420 We don't have time for this!<br />Come on!
8651977 8652873 Y.
8658500 8659542 Stay!
8670537 8671985 Come on. Come on Murph.
8672009 8673306 Murph! Murph. Come on.
8673540 8674445 What's it say?
8674492 8675356 What's it say?
8676126 8677087 What's it say?
8687763 8688725 Stay.
8724633 8725786 Tell him Murph.
8726259 8727340 Make him stay.
8731230 8732550 Make him stay Murph.
8741483 8743097 Make him stay Murph.
8745054 8746682 Don't let me leave Murph!
8750158 8750980 Don't...
8751159 8752731 Don't let me leave Murph!
8757775 8758529 No!
8758553 8759364 No!
8759388 8760031 No!
8760055 8761009 No!
8781598 8782727 It was you.
8794642 8796256 You were my ghost.
8806231 8807120 <i>Cooper.</i>
8807402 8808162 <i>Cooper.</i>
8808366 8809513 <i>Come in Cooper.</i>
8811037 8811787 TARS?
8812244 8813381 <i>Roger that.</i>
8815223 8816389 You survived.
8816637 8817698 <i>Somewhere...</i>
8818509 8820345 <i>in their fifth dimension.</i>
8820666 8822353 <i>They saved us.</i>
8823106 8823886 Yeah?
8824345 8825719 Who the hell is they?
8826330 8828275 And just why would they want to help us?
8828422 8831611 <i>I don't know, but they constructed<br />this three-dimensional space...</i>
8831636 8833563 <i>inside their five-dimensional reality</i>
8833587 8834923 <i>to allow you to understand it.</i>
8834948 8836282 Yeah that ain't working.
8836953 8838126 <i>Yes it is.</i>
8838663 8841962 <i>You have seen that time is represented<br />here as a physical dimension.</i>
8842709 8845892 <i>You have worked out that you can<br />exert a force across space-time.</i>
8846213 8847160 Gravity,
8848392 8849581 to send a message.
8849906 8850963 <i>Affirmative.</i>
8853678 8854681 Gravity
8856160 8857795 can cross the dimensions...
8858105 8859366 including time.
8859742 8860808 <i>Apparently.</i>
8864975 8866782 Do you have the quantum data?
8867192 8868548 <i>Roger. I have it.</i>
8869921 8873829 <i>I am transmitting it on all wavelengths<br />but nothing is getting out Cooper.</i>
8874215 8876290 I can do this. I can do this.
8876660 8879411 <i>But such complicated data to a child?</i>
8879579 8880704 Not just any child.
8880872 8882162 What else?
8882791 8884279 Oh, come on Dad.
8887428 8889396 Murph the fire is out! Come on!
8889464 8890912 <i>Even if you communicate it here,</i>
8890936 8893467 <i>she won't understand its significance for years.</i>
8894261 8895719 I get that TARS.
8895887 8898344 Alright but we we have got<br />to figure something out or...
8898368 8900724 the people on Earth are gonna die.<br />Think, think, think!
8900965 8901863 <i>Cooper...</i>
8902554 8904668 <i>they didn't bring us<br />here to change the past.</i>
8908717 8909771 Say that again.
8910383 8913521 <i>They didn't bring us<br />here to change the past.</i>
8918018 8919847 No they didn't bring us here at all.
8925002 8926369 We brought ourselves.
8935635 8936415 TARS.
8936665 8938626 Give me the coordinates<br />for NASA...
8938838 8940106 in binary.
8940450 8941629 <i>In binary. Roger.</i>
8941653 8942744 <i>Feeding data.</i>
8967200 8968447 It's not a ghost.
8970870 8972072 It's gravity.
8972505 8973907 Don't you get it yet TARS?
8974965 8976322 I brought myself here!
8977710 8978958 We are here to communicate,
8979275 8980775 with the three-dimensional world.
8981431 8982720 We are the bridge!
8991088 8992553 I thought they chose me.
8996380 8998019 But they didn't choose me they chose her.
8998245 8999481 For what Cooper?
9002313 9003606 To save the world.
9008308 9009363 All of this,
9009636 9011282 to one little girl's bedroom.
9011306 9012651 Every moment.
9013021 9014448 It's infinitely complex.
9014506 9015578 They have access,
9015645 9018122 to infinite time and space<br />but they are not bound,
9018146 9019202 by anything!
9019227 9022627 They can't find a specific place<br />in time.
9022986 9024444 They can't communicate.
9025600 9026756 That's why I am here.
9027077 9028757 I am gonna find a way to tell Murph,
9028803 9030213 just like I found this moment.
9030238 9031260 <i>How Cooper?</i>
9031284 9032573 Love TARS love.
9032941 9034013 It's just like Brand said.
9034037 9036307 My connection with Murph,<br />it is quantifiable.
9036474 9037504 It's the key!
9037646 9038997 <i>What are we here to do?</i>
9040523 9041849 Find how to tell her.
9044994 9046083 The watch.
9049457 9050624 The watch.
9052001 9053015 That's it.
9055630 9058122 We code the data into the movement<br />of the second hand.
9062262 9063167 TARS,
9063411 9065472 translate the data<br />into Morse and feed it to me.
9065640 9067338 <i>Translating data to Morse.</i>
9067604 9069520 <i>Cooper what if she never came back for it?</i>
9071604 9072718 She will.
9073484 9074528 She will.
9075583 9077209 Murph I can see his car!
9078419 9079586 He is coming Murph!
9081275 9082061 Ok.
9082428 9083453 I am coming down.
9084617 9085893 <i>How do you know?</i>
9089330 9090705 Because I gave it to her.
9096546 9099047 <i>Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.</i>
9102752 9103877 Dot-dot...
9105013 9106680 dash-dot.
9107140 9108930 <i>Dot-dash-dot-dot.</i>
9109184 9111852 Dot-dash-dot-dot.
9112353 9113687 Dash-dash-dash.
9114022 9116673 Dash. Dash. Dash..
9134542 9135433 He came back!
9136770 9137616 It was him...
9138116 9139118 all the time! I didn't...
9139306 9140702 I didn't know. It was him!
9142050 9143475 Dad is gonna save us.
9186761 9188123 Eureka!
9191766 9192824 It's traditional.
9197626 9198918 Eureka!
9204028 9205055 Did it work?
9205697 9207079 <i>I think it might have.</i>
9208808 9210000 How do you know?
9210068 9211023 <i>Because...</i>
9211109 9213216 <i>the bulk beings<br />are closing the tesseract.</i>
9217584 9219185 Don't you get it yet TARS?
9220753 9221906 They are not beings.
9223156 9224265 They are us.
9226532 9228046 What I have been doing for Murph,
9228457 9229680 they done for me.
9230305 9231329 For all of us.
9231773 9233672 <i>Cooper people could not build this.</i>
9234400 9235372 No. No.
9235396 9236423 No, not yet.
9237045 9238157 But one day.
9239072 9240136 Not you and me.
9241134 9242360 But people.
9243151 9244390 A civilization,
9244414 9246658 that's evolved past<br />the four dimensions we know.
9253686 9254809 What happens now?
9317892 9318762 Mr. Cooper.
9323564 9324755 Let's take it slow sir.
9325566 9326939 Nice and easy Mr. Cooper.
9327986 9329600 Remember you are no spring chicken anymore.
9329889 9332369 Actually you are 124 years old.
9339939 9341016 Take it slow sir.
9342291 9344172 You were... extremely lucky.
9344919 9347655 The Rangers found you with only minutes<br />left in your oxygen supply.
9362337 9363331 Where am I?
9365340 9366432 Cooper Station.
9368301 9369843 Currently orbiting Saturn.
9371846 9373672 Cooper Station.
9376551 9378552 Nice of you to name it after me.
9382017 9383017 What?
9383041 9385072 Well the station isn't named after you sir.
9385096 9386794 It's... it's named after your daughter.
9387253 9388951 Although she's always maintained,
9388975 9390255 just how important you were.
9390423 9391613 Is she still alive?
9394093 9395472 She will be here in a couple weeks.
9397013 9399584 She is far too old to be<br />transferring from another station...
9399609 9401292 but when she heard<br />that you had been found...
9403027 9404049 well this is...
9404073 9405737 this is Murphy<br />Cooper we are talking about.
9406714 9407932 Yes it is.
9410544 9412378 We will have you checked<br />out of here in a couple days.
9415474 9418120 I am sure you will be excited<br />to see what's in store.
9419368 9420515 I actually...
9420848 9422318 did a paper on you,
9422342 9423639 in high school.
9423664 9425529 I know all about your life back on Earth.
9427488 9428655 Oh yeah.
9429003 9429943 Brand.
9432673 9435998 If... If you will follow me we have got<br />a really good situation...
9436740 9437786 for you.
9441247 9442254 So...
9442473 9444856 when I made my suggestion to Miss Cooper...
9446212 9449006 I was delighted to hear<br />that she thought it was perfect.
9452485 9455911 It was just constant.<br />Just that steady blow of dirt.
9455936 9458865 Of course I...<br />I didn't speak to her personally.
9458931 9460832 <i>Set the plates upside-down.</i>
9460861 9463613 <i>Glasses or cups whatever<br />it was upside-down.</i>
9464022 9465652 <i>Well my dad was a farmer.</i>
9466772 9468670 <i>Like everybody else back then.</i>
9469110 9471686 <i>There just was not enough... food.</i>
9471838 9474548 <i>We wore little things little strips...</i>
9474715 9479886 <i>of sheet over our nose and mouth<br />so we would not breathe so much of it.</i>
9479954 9483175 <i>Well it was pretty exciting<br />for me because it was hope.</i>
9483683 9487894 <i>I don't care who describes it there is no<br />way for it to be exaggerated. It was that bad.</i>
9487952 9488842 She did,
9488866 9491514 confirm just how much you loved farming.
9491966 9493748 Oh she did, did she?<br />Yeah.
9493773 9494803 Come here.
9495595 9496683 Home sweet home.
9497198 9498644 Everything replaced and...
9499144 9500423 put back where it...
9507027 9509183 Hey is this...<br />Oh yeah the...
9509222 9512224 The machine we found out near Saturn<br />when we found you. Yes.
9512659 9515416 Its power source was shot<br />but we could get you another one if you wanted.
9515441 9516036 Yes.

9571871 9573427 I don't care much for this...
9573583 9575672 pretending we are back where we started.
9577526 9579214 <i>I want to know where we are.</i>
9581447 9582691 <i>Where we are going.</i>
9587536 9588525 Mr. Cooper.
9588684 9590269 The family is all in there.
9590790 9591707 Family?
9591841 9593530 Yeah they all came out to see her.
9593554 9595719 She is been in cryo-sleep<br />for almost two years.
9628886 9630761 You told them I like farming.
9636736 9638013 It was me Murph.
9641131 9642615 I was your ghost.
9644051 9645240 I know.
9647471 9649119 People didn't believe me.
9649143 9651654 They thought that I was doing it all myself.
9652351 9653130 But...
9656272 9657753 I knew who it was.
9662991 9664557 Nobody believed me.
9665865 9667609 But I knew you would come back.
9670498 9671523 How?
9673981 9676716 Because my dad promised me.
9683257 9684630 Well I am here now Murph.
9686358 9687404 I am here.
9689183 9690045 No.
9692704 9696186 No parent should have<br />to watch their own child die.
9699715 9701889 I have my kids here for me now.
