45834 46976 On your feet!
78041 79481 You were alone?
80792 83709 Spy, you were alone?
83792 85333 I like to be alone.
86709 88375 What did you come here for?
89250 91709 You got a lot of nice stuff.
91875 93166 Other people's stuff.
94917 97000 "To the victor<br />belongs the spoils."
98250 99417 "To the victor"?
100417 101875 Berlin's in rubble.
101959 103709 The Führer's in hiding.
104917 106625 You lost.
112583 114542 What? What? Hey!
114709 115792 Hey, wait a second. Guys!
130583 131583 Doctor.
199041 200184 Looks like<br />they're leaving
200208 201500 without you guys.
202792 204917 Tell us your story, or die.
205709 207041 Story. Um...
207917 209792 Okay, okay.
209959 211709 Well...
211792 213250 it all started
213959 218000 once upon a time,<br />when this village
218083 222709 of stupid blue-eyed boys<br />decided to join hands together
222792 224875 and follow this sweaty<br />little pied piper
224959 226709 named Adolf...
368166 369500 <i>Heil Hitler!</i>
470917 472166 Oh, my!
497750 498959 Get off of me!
527250 528518 There's one reason
528542 530041 you're still alive, birdwatcher.
532583 534125 Who sent you?
534291 535458 What was your mission?
535625 537625 Please, Colonel, no.<br />I beg you.
537792 540083 My name is Basil Shaw.
541333 543333 I'm a professor at Oxford.
543417 544834 An archeologist.
552333 553417 There you are.
566583 568542 I have a daughter. I beg you.
569208 571917 I guarantee you will never see<br />your child again, Mr. Shaw.
573959 578208 Unless you explain<br />why your accomplice had this.
587542 588792 <i>Sieg heil!</i>
600792 603000 <i>We were told<br />that the Lance of Longinus</i>
603083 604917 could be found at the fortress.
605834 607250 We were looking for it.
607750 608750 Why?
610333 611333 Because of its power?
612500 615166 It has no power.
617834 620458 My friend and I<br />were trying to save history.
684917 686625 It's a fake.
701083 702267 Twelfth century.
702291 703500 Thirteenth century.
704250 705792 Ramesses II.
707208 708917 None of this stuff is fake.
711792 713375 I gotta stop this train.
775291 776834 Too many Nazis.

859792 861083 Indy?
861166 862166 Baz?
862500 863500 You're alive!
864208 865208 So far.
866083 868291 I thought I told you<br />to stay in the woods, Baz.
868458 870417 What sort of a man<br />hides in a hedge
870500 872500 while his friend<br />is facing death?
885750 889500 This lot are carting off<br />half the world's antiquities.
889667 892709 I was gonna stop 'em,<br />but now I've gotta rescue you.
893333 894792 Did you at least find the Lance?
895000 896000 "At least"?
896083 897518 Well, have you got it?
897542 899375 - It's a fake.<br />- What?
899834 901375 A reproduction.
909583 910583 Indy?
919542 920834 The Antikythera.
922000 923667 Archimedes' Dial.
925208 926208 Bring it.
943917 945041 Hurry up, Baz.
947959 949333 Give me that.
949500 950625 Come on.
965291 966875 Get up, Baz.
967041 968250 Follow me.
968917 970208 Towards the gun?
970375 971667 Away from the Nazis!

1231750 1232750 Hey!
1235834 1238166 - Here!<br />- They can't hear you, Baz.
1238709 1240083 We gotta jump!
1240250 1241583 What about my dicky knee?
1242083 1243291 Ahh!

1262667 1264291 Go! Move! Move it!
1265917 1268792 Bit rum to go home<br />empty-handed after all that.
1269375 1270583 "Empty-handed"?
1270667 1271875 Not exactly.
1274875 1276000 Archimedes' Dial.
1276166 1277208 Well, half of it.

1459417 1463000 is that Assyrian ceramics of this period<br />are characterized
1463166 1467125 by this complex<br />blue-line pattern.
1467291 1468291 Okay?
1469375 1472750 I assigned pages 131 through 171
1472917 1474542 in Winford for today.
1474709 1476208 Anybody do the reading?
1478500 1479500 Anyone?
1482291 1484333 This is on the test.
1484500 1485709 Okay.
1486917 1488917 Guess I'll spoon-feed it to you.
1491792 1494417 In 213 BC,
1494583 1496583 Roman forces led by Marcellus
1496750 1499583 laid siege<br />to the city of Syracuse.
1499750 1501458 "Syracuse."
1502917 1505500 Not the Syracuse<br />in New York, Tonya.
1505667 1507250 The one in Sicily.
1508041 1510417 Amongst the defenders<br />of the city
1510583 1513667 was its most famous resident,<br />who was...
1515875 1517583 Come on, guys.<br />This is on the final.
1518291 1519875 Archimedes.
1520750 1521792 Archimedes.
1521959 1523291 Archimedes, who was a...
1523458 1524583 A mathematician.
1524750 1525917 A mathematician.
1526083 1528667 But more than that, an inventor,
1528834 1531333 a brilliant engineer
1531500 1532917 who conceived of a way
1533000 1535792 to harness the energy<br />of the Mediterranean sun
1535875 1538709 on concave mirrors and focus it
1538875 1541542 on attacking Roman warships<br />and set them on fire.
1541709 1545208 Who devised giant iron claws
1545375 1547959 that could snatch hostiles<br />from the sea.
1550542 1553417 But how do we know<br />it really happened?
1554542 1558542 What physical, irrefutable<br />archeological evidence
1558709 1562041 - is there of these inventions?<br />- The Antikythera.
1563417 1565583 - The Antikythera.<br />- For starters.
1565750 1567750 They're here!<br />They're downtown!
1569709 1571041 The astronauts.

1687792 1689083 It's fair to say.
1691208 1692291 I'm celebrating.

1723250 1725375 "Doctor" Schmidt.<br />He's in there.
1725542 1727041 And he don't eat anything<br />on wheels,

1761208 1763166 No, no. I mean originally,<br />your people.
1763333 1764333 Do you know?
1768959 1770667 I was born<br />by Yankee Stadium, sir.
1773250 1775083 And you fought for your country?
1776041 1777458 320th Battalion.
1777625 1780000 Set up balloons to stop<br />the planes bombing Normandy.
1785500 1787333 And are you enjoying<br />your victory?
1795166 1796566 Will there be<br />anything else?
1798792 1800000 You didn't win the war.
1801667 1802792 Hitler lost it.
1808417 1809500 Yeah.

1814208 1815417 Yeah, I'm comin'.
1815583 1816583 Let's go, Hauke.
1819917 1821166 Where are we here?
1822250 1823750 Oxford. In the garden.
1826041 1827333 He was an original.
1829750 1831166 I just graduated.
1831333 1832333 In Archeology.
1833291 1835458 Archeology. Wow.
1835625 1837166 Apple didn't fall far.
1837333 1840041 Well, now I'm researching<br />a doctorate.
1841250 1842770 What's your subject?
1843041 1845041 The Archimedes Dial.
1845709 1847125 The Antikythera.
1850083 1851417 What do you know about that?
1851959 1853291 Well, for starters,
1853458 1856834 in 1902, Greek sponge divers<br />found a wrecked Roman warship,
1857000 1858375 huge, off the coast of Greece.
1859000 1860709 Below deck, sealed in wax,
1860875 1862417 was a clock-like mechanism,
1862583 1865375 finely tooled, purpose unknown.
1865542 1867417 Nothing approximating<br />its complexity
1867500 1869500 appears in the world<br />for 1,000 years.
1870667 1872792 - You've done your homework.<br />- Well, not me.
1872959 1874375 Dad. He had<br />all these journals,
1874458 1876000 reams of notes about it.
1876166 1878000 He was obsessed till the end.
1881667 1883834 He told me you found it<br />on a Nazi plunder train.
1885291 1888375 And then lost it in a river<br />in the French Alps.
1890417 1892333 Hmm. Well, that was a long time ago.
1892500 1893959 And it was only half the Dial.
1894041 1895226 - Archimedes...<br />- Archimedes broke the Dial...
1895250 1896935 - disassembled it.<br />- In two, and then hid
1896959 1899101 the two halves from the Romans<br />during the siege of Syracuse.
1899125 1900333 I know. Look.
1901417 1903417 You don't remember the last<br />time I saw you, do you?
1904959 1906083 Remember what?
1906166 1907166 These are the Alps.
1908625 1910208 Yeah, I see.
1910375 1912125 And this is the route<br />that your train took
1912208 1913250 from the Nazi stronghold
1913333 1914333 - in '44.<br />- Right.
1914500 1916291 It went through<br />this mountain pass,
1916458 1918000 and then here.
1918166 1920000 Here, it's the only river<br />on the route.
1920083 1921625 - Right.<br />- Under a bridge.
1921792 1923166 It's down there.<br />It's got to be.
1923333 1925750 - And nobody knows except us.<br />- "Us"?
1926041 1927542 Well, I mean, you.
1927709 1929250 And me. So, yeah.
1929417 1931250 - Us.<br />- Us.
1932250 1934750 And what were you<br />thinking exactly?
1936208 1937291 Well, that maybe...
1939125 1940667 we could go there.
1940834 1941875 And?
1942041 1943125 And find it. And...
1944041 1945667 And I'd become...
1947291 1948458 famous.
1948625 1950917 Oh, well, not famous.<br />Renowned. Feted.
1951500 1953291 A feted archeologist.
1953458 1955166 And you, a final triumph!
1955250 1956375 Indiana Jones!
1956458 1958500 Out with a bang!<br />Back in the saddle!
1961583 1963000 I'm not selling this, am I?
1965500 1966709 Wombat...
1968834 1970667 why are you chasing the thing
1972417 1974500 that drove your father crazy?
1980458 1981875 Wouldn't you?
2000125 2001125 I got it.
2001208 2002328 Parade's comin' soon.
2003250 2004250 So, what we got?
2006000 2008375 She's in there, third floor,<br />with an old guy.
2008542 2009667 Who is he, a Russian?
2009834 2011750 No, a professor.<br />Dr. Henry Jones.
2012834 2013834 Klaber!
2014333 2016417 Klaber, get back here!<br />You're not an agent!
2016583 2017875 God damn it! Go.
2018041 2020625 I'll get support up here<br />and pull a file on Jones.
2041250 2042542 This way.
2078667 2081750 Basil became obsessed<br />by this German theory.
2083291 2084709 Conjecture, really.
2087250 2088875 Archimedes had figured out
2088959 2091959 that the movements<br />of the moon and planets
2092834 2094041 weren't perfect.
2095291 2097792 There were irregularities<br />in their rotations.
2098959 2101250 He thought these<br />irregularities might
2101417 2104792 explain fluctuations<br />in temperature, tides.
2106917 2108208 Storms, even.
2109583 2112458 So, he set about building<br />a device to predict them.
2114166 2115959 But then, he stumbled upon
2116041 2118083 a method to predict even larger
2118834 2119834 disturbances.
2121709 2123125 Larger disturbances?
2123750 2126000 Your father<br />thought this thing could
2126709 2128959 predict fissures in time.
2145959 2147679 Hauke, if you don't...
2149875 2152083 Found 'em.
2159625 2160709 Hello.
2161750 2163959 Are you looking for...
2164125 2165291 Dr. Jones?
2169000 2170250 Excuse me, can I help you?
2170834 2171834 No, thank you.
2171917 2173625 Just a routine investigation,<br />ma'am.
2174709 2177208 Are you the police?
2177291 2178709 It'll just be a few moments.
2178875 2180583 - Professor Plimpton.<br />- Ma'am.
2180667 2181726 - Professor Plimpton!<br />- Ma'am!
2186375 2187375 Drop your weapon.
2187750 2188810 What the hell are you doin'?
2188834 2189959 Um...
2190041 2192208 What the doctor tells me,<br />Miss Mason.
2192291 2193291 Mandy?
2197917 2199959 Yeah, no witnesses.
2204333 2206417 Jesus. What the hell?
2206709 2208142 Your father wrote<br />so many letters
2208166 2210041 about the Dial,<br />I stopped reading 'em.
2213166 2214166 You really don't remember
2214250 2215875 the last time<br />I was at your house?
2217834 2219709 I took that from him then.
2221333 2222933 I thought he'd stopped<br />thinking about it.
2223000 2224059 But your father was convinced
2224083 2227083 this thing was real<br />and dangerous.
2227250 2229208 Do not shoot.
2229625 2233041 He was terrified that if somebody found<br />this legendary tablet,
2233208 2234333 the Grafikos...
2234500 2235559 The tablet containing directions
2235583 2236667 to the rest of the Dial.
2236834 2238074 And if they found the Grafikos,
2238125 2239643 they might acquire<br />the other half of the Dial
2239667 2240667 and put the two together.
2242333 2243573 I knew you wouldn't destroy it.
2247166 2249000 How did you know<br />he asked me to destroy it?
2249875 2251917 - What?<br />- You do remember that night.
2252667 2254583 I was 12 years old, Indy.
2254667 2256147 You knew we didn't drop it<br />in a river.
2256917 2258834 - Baz didn't tell you that.<br />- See, listen.
2258917 2260237 - I didn't...<br />- No, he never lied.
2260709 2261959 - No...<br />- What was all that crap
2262041 2263083 - about the map?<br />- You...
2263250 2264530 No, you've had<br />too many whiskeys.
2265166 2266226 What are you doing, Wombat?
2266250 2267583 Stay where you are.
2268792 2269792 Don't move.
2270542 2272101 - Who are these people?<br />- We need to get out of here.
2272125 2273125 Are they with you?
2273208 2274458 Not an inch, Miss Shaw.
2275667 2276667 Miss Shaw, stop!
2280333 2281333 Helena!
2286125 2287125 Stop!
2289083 2290083 Sorry.
2290166 2293166 - Helena!<br />- Dr. Jones. It's over.
2293333 2294542 Who are you people?
2294709 2295792 What do you want?
2297625 2298625 Stop!
2300709 2301709 Helena Shaw!
2301792 2303309 She's on the roof.<br />Find another way up.
2303333 2304417 Dr. Jones!
2304875 2306275 Dr. Jones,<br />we're not gonna hurt you.
2332750 2334083 Move.<br />We gotta follow 'em.
2334166 2335291 Go. Hurry up.
2362834 2363834 Fan out!
2376667 2378226 All right, let's go.<br />Move, move, move! Pack it up!
2378250 2379393 Come on,<br />get everything.
2379417 2380542 Found her!
2408959 2411250 <i>- Operator.</i><br />- I need the police.
2411417 2413709 Hunter College.<br />People are dead.
2413792 2415017 - Please...<br />- Hang up, fella.
2420875 2421959 Stand up.
2427417 2428500 Okay, okay.
2452834 2454291 She's gone. You blew it,
2454458 2455709 you trigger-happy cracker.
2455875 2458333 - She had it in her hand.<br />- We got the professor.
2461959 2463159 Here's the file on Jones.
2463208 2464208 Yes.
2482458 2483500 Who are you?
2483667 2485125 That's my question.
2495625 2497083 You're CIA.
2497250 2499000 Oh, not me, man.
2499166 2501166 I don't take government jobs.
2501333 2502417 Okay.
2503709 2505875 How are you acquainted<br />with Miss Shaw?
2506250 2507500 She's my goddaughter.
2508250 2509875 I haven't seen her in 18 years.
2510041 2511184 Why did you meet with her today?
2511208 2512208 To give her the Dial?
2513583 2516041 Lady, it's an ancient<br />hunk of gears.
2517000 2518041 Half a hunk.
2518125 2519792 Oh, it's a lot more than that.
2521542 2522709 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
2522792 2524072 Where do you think you're going?
2524208 2525583 I got a parade going on.
2525750 2527208 And a demonstration<br />coming down here.
2527375 2528417 Hey! Hey, hey!
2529083 2530125 - Hey...<br />- Shut up.
2530291 2532709 I can't go this way.<br />Gotta go back.
2537709 2539458 Hell no!<br />What is wrong with you, man?
2539625 2541250 Damn it! Let's go on foot.
2541417 2542542 You heard her.
2544208 2545351 What the hell<br />were you thinking?
2545375 2546726 - Walk! Come on.<br />- What is your problem?
2546750 2547810 You don't look<br />when you're backin' up?
2547834 2549434 - Take care of that guy.<br />- Who's gonna pay for that?
2549458 2550583 Easy, fella. Easy.
2550667 2551667 Keep movin'.
2551750 2553500 Can't you see my cab?<br />It's yellow.
2553583 2555226 No, you're gonna have to pay<br />for this bodywork, man.
2555250 2556250 I don't...
2558125 2560417 Peace now!<br />Peace now!
2561834 2564667 Stop the war!<br />Stop the fighting!
2564834 2566583 - Where are we going, Mason?<br />- This way.
2568625 2570208 - Hell no, we won't go.<br />- Shut up.
2570375 2572101 - Hell no, we won't go!<br />- Hell no!
2572125 2574667 - Hell no, we won't go!<br /><i>- </i>Hell no, we won't go!

2583709 2585583 Hell no, we won't go!
2585667 2589125 Hell no, we won't go!<br />Hell no, we won't go!
2589208 2591458 Hell no, we won't go!<br />Hell no, we won't go!

2603458 2604750 Hey!
2605208 2607208 Officer! Help me!
2607959 2609601 Officer,<br />there was a shooting...
2609625 2611585 - All right, all right.<br />- This morning at Hunter.
2611625 2613375 People are dead. God damn it.
2613458 2615166 Some rogue maniacs<br />broke in and...
2615250 2616875 Sir, you need to calm it down.
2617041 2618250 Please listen to me.
2618417 2620542 There was a shooting<br />this morning, and the...
2620709 2624125 They're in a Con Ed van<br />right around the corner!
2626750 2628375 Hey! What do you think<br />you're doing?
2639458 2640458 Whoa!
2640542 2641875 - Watch out!<br />- What's he doin'?
2641959 2643041 Whoa!
2677625 2678625 Hyah! Hyah!
2691083 2692917 - Move, out the way!<br />- Whoa, whoa!
2694959 2696583 Hyah!
2700250 2701500 - Watch out!<br />- Hyah!
2701875 2703333 Whoa. Whoa.
2703417 2704583 Move! Quickly!
2709959 2711291 Hyah!
2718875 2720291 Move! Move!
2730875 2732208 Go, go, go!
2736709 2737709 Hyah!
2748583 2749792 Hyah!
2752875 2754959 Come on.<br />That's ridiculous.
2755041 2756542 - It's a horse.<br />- Come on.
2759041 2760875 - Hey, mister.<br />- Move! Out of the way!
2761208 2763000 - Hold my horse.<br />- Move! Move!
2763083 2764142 <i>Transfer is available</i>

2780542 2782834 - Subway is faster.<br />- Oh!
2783333 2785083 People tend<br />to romanticize science,
2785166 2787125 when it is, in fact, quite cold.
2787291 2788811 So, what's next,<br />Dr. Schmidt?
2789917 2791000 Mars?
2791792 2793250 No, we've conquered space.
2795083 2796792 I'm moving to the next frontier.
2798250 2800667 What's beyond space?
2804291 2806208 You might wanna<br />get that suit pressed,
2806291 2807291 Dr. Schmidt.
2807917 2809542 We leave for the airport<br />in an hour.
2809917 2811059 He's gonna meet the President.
2811083 2812723 If the President objects<br />to a few creases,
2812750 2815083 perhaps he should find himself<br />another physicist.
2816083 2817917 - Can I use that?<br />- No.
2818291 2819375 Yes.
2819458 2821500 Baxter.
2825667 2826792 It's for you, Doctor.
2830542 2832667 I may wanna leave a bit later<br />for Los Angeles.
2832750 2835041 I'm expecting<br />a delivery shortly.
2838208 2839208 Speak.
2839291 2840891 <i>Your goons made a mess.</i>
2840959 2842125 <i>Did they?</i>
2842291 2844709 Miss Shaw met<br />with a professor. Jones.
2845333 2847083 She acquired the device<br />from him.
2848000 2849083 <i>Then we lost her.</i>
2850750 2852417 <i>Dr. Jones got away as well.</i>
2852834 2854000 <i>Is that so?</i>
2854166 2855500 <i>Most unfortunate.</i>
2855875 2857333 I gotta clean things<br />up here, Doctor.

2928834 2930834 I wish I could say the same,<br />old friend.
2934125 2936041 Quickly, Indy. Inside.
2939834 2942125 Your goddaughter, Helena,
2942291 2944959 was arrested in Tangier<br />last year
2945041 2947875 for auctioning contraband.
2950333 2951417 There's more.
2952458 2955875 She was bailed out<br />by Aziz Rahim.
2956625 2959583 Aziz Rahim is the son<br />of Big Rahim,
2959667 2962417 a well-known Moroccan mobster.
2963959 2967625 Big Rahim<br />owns the Hotel Atlantique
2967792 2970375 in Tangier, and this week,
2970542 2974667 the hotel is hosting<br />its annual auction
2974834 2976709 of stolen antiquities.
2977875 2980375 All the big players<br />are already there.
2980542 2982333 Alia, Jabari.
2982500 2984750 This is the great man<br />who brought our family
2984834 2986667 to America during the war.
2986834 2989208 Quick, when was the Suez Crisis?
2989291 2991750 1956.
2992208 2993583 Very impressive, Jabari.
2993750 2996166 My grandchildren watch<br />too much TV,
2996333 2998875 but they know their history.
2999041 3003208 They understand what it is<br />to be American and Egyptian.
3004083 3006250 I need a ride<br />to the airport, Sallah.
3007333 3009834 If you run, the police will<br />assume that you're guilty.
3010542 3011875 Without Helena or the Dial,
3011959 3013875 I'm gonna get framed for murder.
3015041 3016667 Have you thought<br />about calling Marion?
3017750 3019083 She doesn't wanna talk to me.
3025250 3026518 <i>Welcome to New York's</i>

3034125 3035333 It was under the bed.
3040542 3041583 Thanks, Sallah.
3043875 3045667 I also brought my passport.
3047709 3048917 I could help you.

3050166 3051792 Wherever chance takes us.
3052709 3053792 Indy, I...
3054709 3056166 I miss the desert.
3056750 3058041 I miss the sea.
3059583 3061375 And I miss waking up<br />every morning
3061542 3062959 wondering what<br />wonderful adventure
3063041 3064667 the new day will bring to us.
3065625 3067625 This is not<br />an adventure, Sallah.
3069083 3071667 Those days have come and gone.
3071834 3072875 Perhaps.
3073041 3074375 Perhaps not.

3132041 3133834 I don't understand it, Baz!
3134166 3136166 Well, I was trying to<br />explain it to you downstairs.
3136208 3137500 You've just ignored everything.

3140750 3142834 Indy, Archimedes
3143000 3145208 discovered<br />a temporal meteorology.
3145417 3148041 Archimedes was<br />a mathematician, Baz,
3148208 3149417 not a magician.
3149583 3152041 He could predict<br />fissures in time.
3152208 3153750 Fissures in time?
3154125 3157166 - Baz, you can't prove that!<br />- Well, not yet.
3157333 3159208 Proving it<br />is what makes it science!
3174500 3175709 Oh, Baz.
3177417 3178959 I never should've<br />given you the thing.
3179208 3181166 It... It belongs in a museum.
3182083 3183792 Give it to me. Please.
3187375 3188750 If I give you this,
3189959 3191417 it must be destroyed.
3192917 3194000 I will.
3196625 3198041 I'll destroy it, Baz.
3200542 3201542 Promise.
3207667 3209208 I'm sorry about this.
3209375 3210583 It's all my fault.
3212792 3214250 - Are you gonna be here?<br />- Yes, sir.
3214333 3216417 Okay. I've gotta catch<br />an airplane.
3216583 3219375 If anyone finds the Grafikos,<br />they'll have both halves.
3219458 3220792 Some things should stay buried.
3220875 3221875 I know, Baz.
3221959 3223226 It's vital<br />that you destroy it.
3223250 3224726 - I will, Baz.<br />- Do you understand?
3224750 3226434 - I'll destroy it. Yes.<br />- Say you will, Indy.
3226458 3227458 I will... Yes.
3227542 3229166 You promised me.<br />Remember that.
3229250 3230291 I will... I promise.
3230375 3231417 There's a reason,
3231500 3234083 a reason that Archimedes<br />broke it in two.
3234250 3235959 I know, Baz.
3236125 3238250 - Indy.<br />- Ah.
3239000 3240291 Thanks, Wombat.
3240458 3242417 He's gonna be all right<br />in a few days.
3244500 3245917 I'll call you as soon as I land.
3250959 3252434 <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
3252458 3254917 <i>we are 20 minutes<br />from landing in Tangier.</i>
3288667 3290101 - Stop drinking!<br />- What are you doing?
3290125 3291792 No more champagne!<br />How many more...
3291875 3292959 I'm staying.
3293041 3294500 Go home. Go home!
3310000 3311083 Rahim.
3311166 3313500 Miss Shaw, she's here.
3317750 3318917 Forged in bronze.
3319000 3320041 Nearly complete.
3320125 3321834 It is an astrological clock.
3322417 3324625 Dating third century BC
3324792 3328709 and built by Archimedes himself.
3330750 3332226 All right,<br />let's start at 20,000.
3332250 3333417 20,000, thank you very much.
3333583 3334959 30. 30.
3335125 3337792 Gauges green, power full,
3337959 3340291 and when I reach 85, I rotate.
3340875 3341875 What next?
3341959 3343250 Louis, help him! He's so cute.
3343333 3345375 - Pull back on the yoke.<br />- I did, man. I'm airborne.
3345458 3346458 Yeah, he's airborne.
3346542 3347893 - Can I have a sip?<br />- Do I pick up the flaps?
3347917 3349917 Don't touch the flaps<br />under 400 feet.
3350083 3351750 Decrease your pitch<br />to get to 120.
3351917 3352917 All right.
3355500 3357750 - Private auction, old timer.<br />- I've gotta get in there.
3357917 3360417 No password, no entry.<br />I don't make the rules.
3363250 3364351 And, uh,<br />what is the current bid?
3364375 3366375 - The bid is 50,000.<br />- Then I bid 55.
3366458 3368000 Who'll give me 60?
3368083 3369625 - 60.<br />- 60. 65?
3369709 3371101 65. 70?
3371125 3372458 - 75.<br />- 75. 80?
3372542 3373542 - 80.<br />- 85.
3373625 3374834 How about 90?
3381625 3383875 - This auction is private.<br />- This auction's over.
3384291 3385625 <i>Au contraire,</i> it's hardly begun.
3385709 3387166 - 100.<br />- 100,000.
3387333 3388875 I like the hat, by the way.
3388959 3390434 Makes you look<br />at least two years younger.
3390458 3391685 Thanks.
3391709 3392768 - 110, bravo.<br />- I told you that
3392792 3394872 - this auction is over.<br />- Excuse me, who is this man?
3394917 3396434 - I'm her godfather.<br />- He's mildly related.
3396458 3398375 And she's up past her bedtime.
3398542 3399893 - Come on, Wombat.<br />- I wouldn't do that.
3399917 3401559 You want to explain it<br />to the cops at the bar?
3401583 3402917 The ones I paid off?
3403458 3405041 You're out of your depth,<br />Jonesy.
3405208 3406685 - "Jonesy"?<br />- He thinks I'm a criminal.
3406709 3408458 He's the one wanted for murder.
3408625 3410667 Nice big picture<br />in the <i>New York Herald.</i> 130?
3410834 3412417 I didn't kill anyone.
3412500 3413559 No entry,<br />it's a private auction.
3413583 3414863 And you know it,<br />Helena.
3415291 3418500 But whoever did<br />was looking for this.
3419166 3421041 What you've got here<br />is Pandora's Box.
3422291 3423500 No, actually.
3424375 3425834 It's my box.
3428458 3429458 You.
3431166 3432291 Have we met?
3432583 3433583 No.
3433667 3435107 My memory<br />is a little fuzzy,
3435166 3436875 but your face rings a bell.
3437458 3438500 Are you still a Nazi?
3442625 3444792 You're confused.<br />My name is Schmidt.
3445375 3447542 Professor Schmidt<br />of Alabama University.
3449250 3451542 Professor Schmidt. How nice<br />to meet you in person.
3451625 3453166 150.
3453250 3454476 After our conversation,<br />Miss Shaw,
3454500 3456500 I thought we'd come to<br />an agreement about the Dial.
3456542 3457601 Funny. The last time
3457625 3459017 I saw the other guy<br />who looks like you,
3459041 3460792 he was also after this.
3461375 3463055 Your numbers were light,<br />Professor Schmidt.
3463083 3465043 But good news is, you're here<br />now. The bid is 160.
3465083 3466976 You don't seem<br />to understand, Miss Shaw.
3467000 3468291 This relic is my property.
3468375 3470875 - It's not yours. You stole it.<br />- Then you stole it.
3471041 3472685 And then I stole it.<br />It's called capitalism.
3472709 3473750 The bid is 160.
3473834 3474834 - 160.<br />- 170?
3474917 3475976 You should've<br />stayed in New York.
3476000 3477059 - 170?<br />- You should've stayed
3477083 3479875 - out of Poland.<br />- 170. Anyone? Anyone?
3480041 3481333 Going, going...
3481709 3482709 Gone!
3483333 3484333 Stay away!
3486083 3487083 Get the Dial.
3491041 3492750 Stay away!
3502083 3503083 Oh, hello, Claude.
3503166 3504646 You should not<br />have come back, Helena.
3513500 3514917 Get back.
3525625 3526625 Teddy!
3541000 3542166 Rahim says you stay.
3553959 3554959 Thank you.
3568041 3569500 See you in the past,<br />Dr. Jones.
3596542 3597542 It's my cab!
3603125 3604291 Tell them to back off.
3604458 3606138 I just told them to shoot you.
3607917 3609125 All right, guys.
3610500 3611875 Put the guns down.
3612041 3613250 Put 'em down.
3615208 3616208 All right.
3617875 3619166 That's better.
3623041 3624667 Oh, dear.
3634750 3635875 Rahim.
3636959 3638458 You're in pajamas.
3638959 3640625 I was sleeping, Helena.
3640709 3641851 Mm-hmm.<br />- Peacefully.
3641875 3642875 Oh.
3642959 3644792 My father woke me.
3644959 3647583 He told me you'd<br />returned to our hotel.
3649083 3651333 Then he handed me this scimitar
3651500 3654333 and told me to come home<br />with your head.
3655041 3656083 Huh.
3656166 3657458 Does it have to be that bit?
3665208 3668041 I thought maybe you returned<br />because you loved me.
3668208 3669333 Rahim,
3670083 3671667 I had an item to sell.
3671834 3673709 Excuse me. The item<br />she's talking about
3673792 3674851 - actually belongs to me.<br />- No.
3674875 3676226 You do not need to intrude<br />in this conversation.
3676250 3677434 And some very bad people,<br />worse people...
3677458 3678726 You do not need to get<br />involved with my business.
3678750 3680267 - Have run off with it.<br />- Is this your new man?
3680291 3682000 - No. No, no, no, no.<br />- It's complicated.
3683333 3684834 What exactly<br />do you owe this guy?
3685000 3687083 Just some bail money<br />and a lifetime of happiness.
3687250 3688917 I presume you sold the ring.
3689083 3690851 It didn't go for as much<br />as I thought it would.
3690875 3691917 I'll do it!
3692000 3693142 What are you... Hey!
3699417 3700917 You just got me killed!
3701083 3703667 Well, I'm not the one that's<br />engaged to a mobster!
3703834 3706750 I don't need morality lessons<br />from an aging grave robber!
3706917 3708125 I'm not a grave robber.
3708291 3710333 Your father and I<br />did important work together.
3713000 3714643 Don't tell me<br />all your escapades were noble,
3714667 3716291 selfless quests.<br />You did it for the buzz!
3719000 3720041 Oh, good work, Teddy!
3721542 3723208 - Move over, kid.<br />- Hey!
3733917 3735792 - Helena!<br />- Back up! Back up!
3753709 3754709 Not this way!
3754792 3756518 You don't know where you're<br />going, Indy! Listen to him.
3756542 3758062 - He knows this town!<br />- I know Tangier!
3762375 3763417 There he is!
3768542 3770667 Faster. Go faster!
3770834 3772750 Ten minutes<br />to the airport, boss.
3774750 3776142 I'm not sure<br />Professor Schmidt
3776166 3777526 is an actual professor,<br />by the way.
3777625 3778893 - He's a Nazi!<br />- Turn left!
3778917 3780458 Turn left! Turn left!
3780542 3781709 - Oh, no!<br />- No!
3796417 3798375 Helena! Don't do this!
3806333 3807875 - Hey, this way!<br />- That way!
3808834 3809834 No!
3810792 3812291 Helena!
3814458 3815458 No!
3825041 3826583 What the hell?
3833208 3834500 Helena!
3836458 3838333 Hey! Hey!
3838917 3840517 What the hell?
3843208 3844250 Come on!
3848041 3849875 Come on. Come on!
3883750 3885625 You think he'd be proud of this?
3886542 3887542 Who?
3888875 3890000 Your father!
3890083 3893125 His only daughter selling<br />her soul for bail money!
3893291 3894810 Sounds quite cool<br />when you put it like that.
3894834 3896458 And it's not all bail money.
3896542 3897834 Some of it's gambling debt
3897917 3899059 - and some...<br />- Thank you, Teddy.
3899083 3900875 Helena! No!
3900959 3901959 Helena!
3903667 3905542 How did you end up like this?
3905709 3907041 Well, you mean resourceful?
3907208 3909542 Daring? Beautiful?<br />Self-sufficient?
3919417 3920959 Whoa!
3934875 3936333 Hold on!
3939417 3940417 Go this way!
3949792 3950792 There he is.
3962875 3964101 Stop!
3964125 3965917 - Hey! Hey!<br />- Stop!
3968959 3970250 Aah!
3978625 3979792 On the left!
3980917 3981917 Take the wheel, Teddy!
3984125 3985166 What are you doing?
3985333 3986875 Getting what's mine.
3987834 3988834 Helena!
3993041 3995166 Damn it! You crazy?
3996625 3999125 Hey! Helena!
4003125 4004750 - Take the gun!<br />- Miss Shaw.
4006166 4007834 Let go, Miss Shaw!
4030250 4031667 Let go.
4031750 4034125 Come on! Give me the Dial!
4034875 4036917 Helena!
4038291 4039750 Damn.
4046542 4047726 Turn back! They went that way!
4047750 4048750 He's gone!
4048834 4050667 - Move over!<br />- Hey!
4054083 4057041 I didn't come here to<br />rescue you from your fiancé!
4057125 4058125 Rescue me?
4063291 4064917 I just want the Dial back.
4084375 4086000 Put your hands<br />above your head.
4087125 4088643 Not the smoothest<br />break-up I ever had.
4088667 4089976 If your father<br />was still alive...
4090000 4091101 Well, he's not, Indy.
4091125 4092685 Hey, something's wrong<br />with the engine.
4092709 4093976 If only there'd been<br />someone there for me,
4094000 4095500 some father figure, someone
4095583 4097709 specifically anointed<br />for the job.
4097875 4099195 You have no idea<br />about the kind...
4099250 4100309 Don't beat yourself up about it.
4100333 4102375 I mean,<br />what even is a godfather?
4103375 4105417 Anyway, family never<br />was your strong suit.
4106083 4108417 - What is the time, by the way?<br />- It's...
4108583 4109583 Hey, no fair.
4110291 4111333 Give me that back.
4111417 4112625 That was my father's watch!
4115041 4116041 Give it back to him.
4120500 4122059 You're gonna have<br />to leave town with me.
4122083 4123583 Rahim will be<br />looking for you too.
4123750 4125059 They'll go to<br />Tangier airport first,
4125083 4126142 so we'll need to catch a train
4126166 4127446 and get a plane from Casablanca.
4128208 4130417 Whoa. What was that?
4134291 4135417 Ah.
4135500 4136500 Damn.
4138917 4140000 Yeah.
4140083 4141208 I know, sir.
4143417 4144417 Yes...
4145667 4146667 Copy.
4151750 4153041 They pulled the plug.
4153125 4154500 You got them scared.
4154875 4156075 Because they don't understand.
4156125 4157709 No. Because your associates
4157792 4159125 killed three American civilians
4159291 4161542 and blew up<br />a nationally televised parade.
4161709 4162875 Because you stood up
4162959 4164667 the President<br />of the United States,
4164834 4166000 ran to Morocco,
4166166 4168583 and created an incident that<br />required military extraction!
4170709 4172476 Then take me to DC,<br />and I will explain it all.
4172500 4173917 They want you to vanish.
4174083 4176208 We have half the Dial now.
4176375 4177935 They were just trying<br />to keep you happy,
4178709 4180375 letting you chase that thing.
4180542 4181583 They never cared about it.
4181667 4182810 They will, Miss Mason,
4182834 4184458 when they understand<br />what it can do.
4184625 4185865 You put them<br />on the moon.
4186458 4187709 They got what they wanted.
4189000 4190917 All right, buckle up.<br />We're landing in Spain.
4191542 4193542 C-9 transport will take you<br />from there to Maxwell.
4193709 4195166 I'm not going back to Alabama!
4195333 4197583 All we need is a vessel to<br />take us to the Mediterranean.
4198250 4199726 The Grafikos<br />will take us to the other...
4199750 4201834 Please, Miss Mason. Please.
4202000 4203041 Let go of me, Schmidt.
4203208 4204834 I'm asking you personally.
4205750 4207166 You're a piece of work, Doc.
4208709 4209750 Hey!
4237750 4239250 Schmidt...
4240166 4241792 My name is Voller.
4244583 4245959 Jürgen Voller.
4259250 4261041 That's a Sea Stallion.
4261208 4262625 American helicopter.
4263625 4265333 Did you know<br />the Wright Brothers?
4265792 4267250 - What?<br />- The Wright Brothers.
4267417 4268500 Orville and Wilbur.
4268667 4270917 They invented the airplane,<br />and they lived in Indiana.
4271083 4272625 Wilbur was born in Indiana.
4272792 4275208 I'm not from Indiana, Teddy.
4275291 4277917 And the Wright Brothers were<br />born during the Civil War.
4278083 4280208 Oh, I thought maybe you went<br />to school with them.
4281625 4284083 Oh, come on, Indy.<br />That was funny.
4284250 4285542 - "Funny"?<br />- Mm-hmm.
4286208 4287500 I'm stuck in Tangier
4287583 4289917 with a broken tuk-tuk<br />and two thieves.
4290083 4291291 I'm wanted for murder.
4291375 4293417 Nazis have<br />half of Archimedes' Dial
4293583 4295000 and your father's notebooks.
4296208 4297375 I have a copy.
4298208 4299667 Dad's notebooks.<br />I made a copy.
4299750 4301667 Where?
4301750 4303709 You memorized five notebooks?
4303875 4305083 Seven. And of course not.
4305250 4306875 Half of them were<br />as dull as ditchwater.
4307750 4310166 Just the really important bits.
4311041 4312041 Like what?
4312500 4313660 The location of the Grafikos.
4313792 4315500 Nobody knows<br />where the Grafikos is.
4315667 4317000 - Dad did.<br />- No, he didn't.
4317166 4318366 - Yes, he did.<br />- No, he didn't.
4318500 4320125 - Yes, he did.<br />- What's a Grafikos?
4320291 4321726 It's directions<br />to the rest of the Dial.
4321750 4323309 Ask her if she knows<br />what language it's in.
4323333 4325333 Ah! It isn't in a language.<br />It's in a code.
4325500 4326709 What code?
4326875 4328333 Archimedes used two codes.
4328500 4330041 Linear B and Polybius Square.
4330208 4331834 So, even if you find<br />the Grafikos,
4331917 4333542 without me, you can't read it.
4333625 4335417 Please.
4335583 4337417 Dad taught me Polybius<br />when I was nine.
4337583 4339303 Used to leave little notes<br />around the house.
4339333 4340333 "Tidy your room."
4340417 4341709 "Stay away from my brandy."
4342834 4343875 What if it's Linear B?
4344834 4346208 50 quid it's Polybius.
4347250 4348375 Give me that.
4348458 4349458 Hey.
4349875 4351083 That won't work.
4351250 4353531 Moroccan chewing gum's made<br />from the sap of the Manilkara.
4353667 4354959 Heat resistant.
4356458 4357667 Try and start it.
4362583 4363750 - Start it.<br />- I am.
4365291 4367417 Huh? Huh?
4368125 4369709 - Huh?<br />- It won't hold.
4369875 4371792 It'll get us<br />to the train station.
4371959 4373083 "Us"?
4373250 4374490 - You goin' home?<br />- No.
4374625 4376458 I'm going to Casablanca.
4376625 4378375 Then I'm gonna hop a plane<br />to the Aegean.
4378458 4379458 Just like you.
4379875 4381559 What makes you think<br />we're going to the Aegean?
4381583 4384667 You gotta get to the Grafikos<br />before the Nazis.
4384834 4386917 Archimedes was<br />surrounded by Romans.
4387625 4388834 Where else would it be?
4389000 4390000 The Aegean is huge, Indy.
4390166 4391406 And you don't have coordinates.
4391458 4393000 And you don't have a boat.
4395917 4398333 I've got an old friend<br />in Greece.
4398500 4399875 An expert diver.
4400041 4401875 With a big, beautiful boat
4402041 4404083 that'll get us there<br />before they will.
4404959 4407000 You need me,
4407166 4408375 and you know it.
4458500 4459792 Renny!
4461875 4462917 Indy?
4463750 4464792 Indy!
4470250 4472208 So, that's the expert diver?
4472375 4474583 Spain's greatest frogman.
4476750 4478375 Hey!
4478542 4480625 So, Spain's greatest frogman<br />has a shit boat
4480709 4482000 and only one good frog leg?
4482166 4483208 Stop it.
4487000 4488267 You got<br />a different boat.
4488291 4489500 Stop it.
4503792 4504834 We're going here.
4506458 4508917 Where they found the first<br />part of the Antikythera.
4509834 4511000 But...
4512333 4513625 we're going deeper.
4515208 4517208 Dad tracked down<br />the old sponge diver
4517291 4518917 who found the Dial.
4519083 4520250 He told him
4520417 4523375 that the wrecked Roman ship<br />broke up under the sea
4523542 4524667 70 feet below.
4524834 4527792 Filled with the skeletons<br />of over 100 centurions.
4528959 4530125 That's where they found it.
4530875 4534792 But he said that most<br />of the ship had broken off
4534959 4536709 and sunk to the ocean floor.
4537667 4539250 Too deep for sponge divers.
4540291 4543166 So, Dad started wondering<br />why a Roman warship
4543333 4546709 would sail out of Syracuse<br />with 100 centurions on board.
4550417 4553792 They weren't taking<br />half a Dial for a joyride.
4557625 4559208 They had the Grafikos...
4562083 4564250 and they were looking<br />for the rest of the Dial.
4567542 4569166 Your dad was a genius.
4569792 4570834 Yeah.
4572250 4573291 He was.
4593166 4594326 Seven of spades.
4597458 4598542 How do you do that?
4598709 4600125 Wow.
4600208 4601417 Do it again.
4605417 4607291 Pick a card, Dr. Jones.
4614792 4615917 Seven of spades!
4618041 4619083 She's magic.
4619250 4620417 Trick deck.
4620583 4621583 No.
4622750 4624166 I force the card.
4624333 4625667 I offer the mark,
4625834 4627000 you,
4627166 4628166 the feeling of a choice,
4628333 4630542 but ultimately, I make you<br />pick the card I want.
4632667 4633834 "The mark."
4636875 4638792 Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day.
4638875 4640709 I have to check the lines.
4646750 4647834 Good night.
4650959 4654083 You remember seeing any dates<br />in your father's notebooks?
4655417 4656792 Dates?
4656875 4658250 What dates?
4659166 4660166 These dates.
4663875 4666333 Written over and over again<br />in this letter.
4667792 4669625 August 20th, 1969.
4669792 4671333 That's three days from now.
4671500 4673750 And the same date in 1939.
4673917 4676333 Two weeks before<br />Hitler invades Poland.
4678166 4679750 Wait.
4680542 4682875 Now you believe the Dial<br />has magical powers?
4684166 4686208 I don't believe in magic,<br />Wombat.
4688083 4690458 But a few times in my life,<br />I've seen things.
4693583 4695333 Things I can't explain.
4696667 4699041 And I've come to believe<br />it's not so much
4699208 4701333 what you believe.
4701500 4703750 It's how hard you believe it.
4706875 4708208 I've seen things too, Indy.
4709166 4711709 The only thing<br />worth believing in, ever,
4711875 4713542 is cash.
4715834 4716917 Right.
4722709 4724029 What if you could<br />go back in time?
4726166 4727208 What would you do?
4728583 4730000 Witness the Trojan War?
4731291 4732625 Check in on Cleopatra?
4736250 4738375 I'd stop my son from enlisting.
4741542 4743250 Did he sign up to please you?
4744333 4746542 No, he signed up to piss me off.
4750250 4751750 How would you have stopped him?
4756625 4758465 I'd tell him<br />he was gonna die.
4765500 4767375 I'd tell him<br />that his mother would...
4770000 4771834 find no end to her grief.
4773667 4775417 And that his father would be...
4778250 4780166 helpless to console her.
4783458 4785959 And that the loss would put<br />an end to their marriage.
4800000 4801208 You're still wearing the ring.
4820959 4822208 Mm.
4823875 4825291 Promising.
4834041 4835458 More promising.
4841250 4842333 Hello.
4844542 4846542 Get your gear on.<br />They're waiting.
4851166 4852250 Hey.
4853250 4854250 Come here.
4855083 4856458 Okay.
4856542 4857601 I'm gonna show you something.
4857625 4860625 Gosh, this looks important.
4862792 4863792 Around the rope...
4863875 4866000 Now, we are going deep.
4866166 4869000 Descend fast, and breathe<br />through these hoses.
4869166 4870208 Okay?
4870291 4872000 Ah, stay separate.
4872166 4874125 No crisscross. All right?
4874291 4875500 We cannot stay long.
4875667 4879000 I have a method that<br />usually prevents the bends.
4880000 4881125 - Usually?<br />- Yeah.
4881208 4882417 I call it "the bounce."
4882583 4883583 You know, fast down,
4883750 4885667 three minutes on the bottom,<br />and then up.
4885834 4886875 Three minutes!
4887041 4888875 No one more second.
4889542 4891792 - Three minutes.<br />- Yeah, that's right.
4891959 4893799 - Where is my lighter?<br />- I don't know, <i>capitán.</i>
4894166 4895959 We have to go.
4898291 4899750 Uh, quick question.
4899917 4901250 What's that?
4901417 4902792 - They're sharks?<br />- No.
4902875 4905250 No, no. No sharks here. Eels.
4906333 4908625 - Eels?<br />- Anguilas.
4908709 4909709 Most are small.
4909875 4911458 Sometimes they are big.<br />Two meters.
4911625 4913667 But if you see them, stay still.
4913834 4917083 They bite you,<br />they lock the jaw. Yeah.
4917250 4918667 They look like snakes.
4919375 4920375 No, they don't.
4920458 4922625 Private Brandy<br />reporting for duty.
4923125 4924125 You're not coming, Teddy?
4924875 4926000 I can't swim.
4926166 4927291 Lucky him.
4927458 4928750 Everyone can swim.
4930625 4932500 Reach and pull.<br />Reach and pull.
4934542 4935685 All right.<br />You stay here
4935709 4937000 with Hector and watch our lines.
4940000 4941917 It is time, <i>camarada.</i>
5050291 5051291 Two minutes?
5184542 5185542 Hey.
5217417 5218537 <i>Hurry up!</i>
5233458 5234959 Helena!
5243709 5244709 Come on.
5244875 5246417 That's it. That's it.<br />That's it.
5247250 5248458 That's it.
5271834 5273034 Who are these people?
5275250 5276250 Nazis.
5276333 5278792 First, you return my Dial,<br />Dr. Jones,
5278959 5282083 and now,<br />you bring me the Grafikos.
5283000 5285166 I'm very happy you're not<br />wasting in retirement.
5285542 5287917 I should have retired you<br />when I had the chance.
5288083 5289208 Where are your sponsors?
5289375 5290959 I'm on my own now.
5291125 5292834 Things move forward,<br />Dr. Jones.
5292917 5293917 And sometimes...
5295792 5297583 they go backward.
5300834 5303083 Now, let's get comfortable<br />and have a little talk.
5330125 5331500 What language is that?
5331667 5333250 It's not a language.
5334542 5335625 It's a code.
5336458 5337458 Polybius.
5338291 5339583 You owe me 50 quid.
5341917 5343709 Not familiar<br />with Polybius cipher?
5343875 5344875 No.
5345625 5347041 But it appears you are.
5351417 5352625 Read it, please.
5360750 5361750 No.
5367500 5368500 Indy...
5379625 5380917 Feeling helpful now?
5384166 5385166 I am.
5388333 5389583 I know this stuff backwards.
5389750 5390834 No!
5392417 5393417 Sorry, Indy.
5393834 5395208 I don't do noble death.
5395875 5396959 Just
5397125 5398542 cold, hard maths.
5399083 5400923 I crack the code,<br />help you find the other half.
5402333 5403959 One hundred grand. Cash.
5404041 5405125 Helena...
5405792 5406792 Take it or leave it.
5408291 5409333 You have a deal.
5422959 5424667 He'll never pay you.
5426208 5427601 I think<br />you will find this is worth
5427625 5429083 more than your asking price.
5438583 5440083 - Teddy.<br />- Helena,
5440250 5441417 don't do this.
5446834 5448250 Let's see what we've got here.
5450417 5451792 "My <i>Makhana..."</i>
5452291 5453291 that's "machine"...
5454542 5458083 "lies with me,<br />in the city I left.
5458250 5460667 "Where wolves teach men to walk.
5460834 5464959 "Under one of nine, I lie."
5467792 5469500 Only one thing<br />lies anywhere forever.
5469667 5472375 The dead. So, if the Dial lies<br />with him, then...
5474250 5475750 then this is directions<br />to his tomb.
5476250 5477583 The Tomb of Archimedes?
5479000 5480792 Undiscovered for two millennia.
5483875 5485959 "The city I left."
5486583 5488625 Archimedes lived two places<br />his entire life,
5488709 5490041 so he only left one.
5490917 5492917 Anyone? At the back?
5493792 5495333 Come on, Indy.<br />Everyone knows this.
5495500 5497333 - Even this clown.<br />- Alexandria.
5498000 5499834 Full marks.
5500333 5502500 Now, "wolf"<br />in Greek is <i>"lycos."</i>
5502583 5504917 Root of the word<br /><i>"lycaeum"</i> or "school."
5505083 5507709 And the Doric<br />for "walking" is...
5508959 5509959 <i>"peripatio."</i>
5511250 5514000 Which also happens to be<br />the word for...
5515333 5516583 Aw.
5519250 5521208 I thought you were<br />a bright spark.
5523792 5526917 <i>"Peripatio"</i> means "walking,"
5527083 5529500 but it also means "counting."
5529667 5532792 So, "Where wolves<br />teach men to walk"
5533542 5535834 - could be...<br />- The School of Mathematics.
5537166 5538750 Is correct.
5538917 5540458 Now, the next bit is easy.
5541750 5543375 "Beneath one of nine"?
5544542 5545875 There are nine Muses.
5546041 5547166 The <i>Museon.</i>
5547333 5549792 The Greek word for the<br />Great Library of Alexandria.
5549875 5551000 Which, as we all know,
5551083 5553750 has nine statues<br />supporting its roof.
5553917 5554917 May I?
5556083 5557208 Thank you.
5558375 5561125 The nine Muses,<br />in reverse order,
5562583 5564083 are Calliope,
5564834 5565834 Urania,
5567417 5568458 Polymnia,
5569417 5570959 - Erato...<br />- Polymnia.
5571166 5573542 And Meli whasisname,
5573917 5574917 that other one,
5575667 5576667 Thalia,
5577417 5578625 Euteroe,
5578792 5580875 but the first is...
5581125 5582125 Clio.
5584000 5585166 The Muse of history and time.
5585333 5586542 That Archimedes,
5586709 5588017 - what a clever bugger.<br />- The entrance
5588041 5590166 to the tomb is by<br />the School of Mathematics,
5590333 5592041 under a statue of Clio,
5592208 5594959 in the ruins of the Great<br />Library of Alexandria.
5595125 5596417 Gold star for Dr. Brains.
5597792 5598792 Teddy!
5608709 5610291 The Grafikos, get it!
5637959 5640667 I have said it before,<br />and I will say it again!
5640834 5643458 When you're<br />in a tight spot, dynamite.
5645208 5646750 My friend was just murdered.
5652250 5653250 Sorry.
5653417 5655166 You told them everything.
5656875 5657959 Word for word.
5658583 5660500 But Archimedes<br />didn't make it that easy.
5661291 5663208 The tomb isn't in Alexandria.
5672291 5673291 Go!
5676750 5677870 So, what do you see?
5678417 5680208 Polybius square.
5680750 5681875 Made of?
5684417 5685625 Wax and wood.
5687250 5688500 Anything else?
5691959 5692959 It's heavy.
5696000 5697125 Too heavy.
5699250 5700375 Give me that.
5740583 5742291 This is solid gold?
5742458 5743667 Ancient gold.
5745166 5746166 From the Nile.
5747834 5748834 Hold it, Teddy.
5760375 5761458 Sell this thing
5761625 5763291 and we are out of the hole<br />and then some.
5763375 5764375 I have just the customer.
5764542 5765917 Cranky, old Duchess<br />in Gibraltar...
5766000 5767959 This is going in a museum.
5770834 5772125 Take the wheel, Teddy.
5779000 5780000 What does it say?
5782125 5785000 "Search where Dionysius
5785792 5788542 "hears each whisper
5789375 5791417 "like a hurricane."
5794291 5795709 The Ear.
5796417 5798208 The cave of Dionysius.
5799041 5800041 Where is that?
5801500 5802542 In Sicily.
5804041 5806125 - How much fuel have we got?<br />- It's full.
5815125 5816125 They're heading west.
5817500 5818500 Not east.
5847458 5849583 - I want the papaya.<br />- How much is it?
5853041 5854041 Take this.
5856792 5858959 Look at that kid<br />with the straw hat.
5859250 5861041 This way.
5864625 5865625 Hey.
5866667 5869125 What do you think?
5874917 5876208 What are we doing?
5877834 5879500 Waiting for closing time<br />at the caves.
5879667 5881166 It's crawling with tourists.
5881333 5883750 Okay, so he's, like,<br />running the show now?
5885125 5886542 He's not running<br />the show, Teddy.
5887917 5891041 I just thought we were in this<br />for all the wrong reasons.
5891625 5892792 We are.
5896250 5897250 Most assuredly.
5897333 5900083 You know he's never gonna<br />let us sell any of that stuff.
5901625 5903250 I'm still in charge, Teddy.
5903333 5904434 Helena,<br />get over here!
5904458 5905458 Give me a hand!
5911375 5912500 Oh, you splurged.
5913834 5914875 Here's your backpack.
5914959 5916000 Where's the kid?
5929959 5931601 Hey, watch it!
5931625 5932875 What's wrong<br />with you?
5961417 5962583 Hello.
5964000 5965000 Hey.
5967750 5969000 Let me go!
5970291 5971333 Let me go!
5979125 5981875 Get off me! Let me go!
5985000 5986208 Hey, hey, hey!
5997041 5998125 Helena!
5999500 6000959 They've got Teddy.
6003083 6004667 They took him<br />up the hill somewhere.
6013542 6015542 Hey. Hey! Hey!
6024750 6025976 What are they<br />gonna do to him?
6026000 6028667 He knows about the Ear,<br />what the Grafikos says.
6030041 6031500 They're not gonna hurt him.
6031667 6032834 They're gonna use him
6033583 6035834 to get the other half<br />of the Dial.
6035917 6036959 We gotta get there first.
6050166 6054208 Colonizing queens<br />built many cities in Sicily.
6054375 6055875 - The temple...<br />- Let's go.
6056542 6059083 Is the oldest<br />of the Greek temples.
6060166 6061542 The cave's over there.
6071917 6073667 Could we go<br />a little faster, please?
6082875 6084375 The Ear of Dionysius.
6092083 6093083 Wow.
6107291 6109000 "Search where Dionysius hears
6109083 6110792 "each whisper<br />like a hurricane."
6112000 6113000 That's some echo.
6114750 6117333 Keep making noise till we<br />find out where it's loudest.
6134792 6135959 Stop.
6143542 6144667 This is it.
6149625 6151125 Greek pediment.
6151792 6152792 An entrance.
6154208 6155208 Used to be.
6158500 6159500 A crescent.
6162375 6163458 Just like on the Grafikos.
6171083 6172917 I think there's<br />an opening up there.
6179542 6180542 You okay up there?
6181709 6182875 Yes.
6185375 6186417 You're not moving.
6188917 6190125 I'm thinking.
6192959 6193959 About?
6195125 6198041 About what the hell I'm doing<br />up here, 40 feet in the air,
6198375 6199959 with crap shoulders,
6200125 6201917 crumbling vertebrae,
6202083 6204583 a plate in one leg,<br />screws in the other.
6204750 6206000 Yeah, I get it. I get it.
6206625 6207750 No, you don't get it.
6208583 6209834 You're half my age.
6210875 6213542 You haven't been forced<br />to drink the blood of Kali.
6213709 6214959 No. Fair enough.
6215792 6217542 Or been tortured with voodoo.
6218917 6219917 And I'm just guessing,
6220000 6221800 but I don't think<br />you've been shot nine times,
6221834 6224291 including once by your father.
6226041 6227375 Dad shot you?
6228083 6229250 Don't talk to me.
6229417 6230617 Just go ahead.<br />I'll follow you.
6239333 6241917 No, no, no. We are close.<br />We are close.
6242083 6243083 Look around you.
6243250 6244810 - We are close.<br />- The Cave of Dionysius.
6244917 6247792 No, no, no. The cave<br />is closed for renovation.
6248792 6249792 Oh.
6249875 6250959 Let me ask again.
6251041 6252959 Where is the Cave of Dionysius?
6272583 6274750 What's the matter?<br />You worried about the kid?
6276041 6277709 Are you sure<br />they won't hurt him?
6277875 6279083 He'll be fine.
6279250 6280291 He's smart.
6282166 6283542 Where'd you find him?
6284333 6287375 He, uh... He tried to steal<br />my purse outside a casino
6287458 6289917 in Marrakesh when he was 10.
6290083 6291917 I hit him repeatedly<br />with my car door,
6292125 6294625 but he didn't let go<br />and neither did I.
6294792 6296333 So, been together ever since.
6297458 6299417 Thought you were<br />all about the money.
6300542 6301542 I am.
6304625 6306458 Nobody memorizes every page
6306542 6308667 of their dead father's notebooks
6308834 6309917 for the money.
6316542 6318000 <i>Herr</i> Voller!
6328166 6329542 They went that way.
6339917 6341667 Why?
6344875 6346709 Come on, come on.
6348583 6350375 Let's go.
6355083 6356083 Oh, my...
6359125 6360625 Oh, my God!
6361458 6362792 Oh, my God!
6363000 6364375 - Oh, God!<br />- No, no.
6365291 6366667 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
6371208 6372834 Are they off me? Get 'em off!
6372917 6374583 - No, no. Wait.<br />- Get 'em off!
6387667 6388750 What is that?
6391709 6393208 Methane.
6394250 6395458 Don't breathe.
6395625 6396625 Don't breathe?
6400333 6401709 We've gotta get outta here.
6410542 6411542 Athena.
6413291 6414583 Goddess of war.
6417500 6418709 And reason.
6423000 6424375 "Under the moon...
6426667 6428667 "life lies at her feet."
6436417 6437750 Water displacement.
6438542 6439875 Get in the pool!
6440041 6442041 Why?<br />Help me open the door.
6442208 6443834 Well, they didn't<br />get out the doors!
6443917 6444917 Get in the pool!
6445959 6447834 Okay, I'm getting in the pool.
6448000 6449125 Help me.
6451542 6453875 Archimedes was fascinated
6455375 6457333 by water displacement!
6471208 6472208 Whoa!
6498333 6500667 Hey! Get back here! Klaber!
6514875 6516041 You don't need to do that.
6542125 6543166 Hey!
6544542 6546291 Give me that!
6547083 6548792 No!
6555333 6556625 Leave them.
6557333 6558959 I said leave them.
6583375 6584959 Reach and pull.
6585125 6586709 Reach and pull.
6586875 6589041 Reach and pull.
6617458 6619000 Archimedes' tomb.
6647959 6649250 Grab that corner.
6695583 6696583 Indy.
6698875 6700250 This frieze...
6702917 6704166 It's a phoenix.
6704333 6705333 A common icon.
6705500 6707083 No. Look,<br />it isn't.
6708667 6710417 This phoenix has propellers.
6719291 6720750 What's this doing here?
6729542 6732542 Clocks won't be invented<br />for 1,000 years,
6733208 6734667 much less watches.
6737208 6738417 Archimedes used it.
6741959 6743333 Dad was right.
6744000 6745000 It works.
6745083 6746709 Of course it works,<br />Miss Shaw.
6749417 6750709 Mathematics works.
6751834 6754834 As it conquered space,<br />it will conquer time.
6762709 6764625 You've already<br />lost your son, Dr. Jones.
6764792 6765792 Your wife is gone.
6765875 6767792 Do you really<br />want to lose your godchild?
6770875 6771959 For what?
6772375 6774542 A world that no longer cares<br />about men like us.
6785875 6786875 Thank you.
6825583 6826959 History's greatest moment.
6834083 6835375 Its end.
6843041 6844081 Throw me the gun!
6854417 6856667 - Get him outta here.<br />- Teddy.
6857709 6858834 Teddy! Teddy!
6859000 6860041 Come on! Go!
6860125 6861125 This way. Come on.
6865208 6866750 Go!
6870333 6871333 Indy!
6873333 6874500 Go!
6874667 6875959 Go!
6876125 6877208 Stop!
6880583 6882000 Now what?
6883625 6884625 Bring him.
6892709 6893709 Helena, come on!
6893875 6895166 Teddy, we can't just leave him.
6895250 6896583 We're not! Follow me!
6898542 6899542 Come on!
6903458 6904542 Come on.
6918750 6920709 Teddy. Come on.<br />We've got a car.
6925166 6926583 Ah, crap.
6932792 6933834 Stay there.
6952709 6953709 Hop on.
6957333 6960291 The first hemisphere<br />sets the destination.
6961792 6965375 The second calculates<br />the location of the fissure
6966625 6968458 in Alexandrine coordinates.
6969041 6971917 Have Messner transpose this<br />to longitude and latitude,
6972959 6974834 and transmit waypoints<br />to the pilots.
6986959 6988458 Shortcut.
6992750 6995709 You got coordinates for 37.07.
6995792 6997125 So, who is it?
6997875 6999125 Churchill?
7000500 7001500 Ike?
7003834 7006333 Who are you gonna kill<br />to win the war?
7007166 7010041 In a few minutes,<br />with the help of Archimedes,
7010208 7012083 we shall fly<br />into the eye of this storm
7012875 7015125 and cross into Sicilian airspace
7015291 7018792 on August 20th, 1939.
7019542 7021375 We will head north<br />over friendly skies
7021458 7023083 with enough fuel<br />to reach Munich.
7024375 7026000 My quarry will be waiting for me
7026542 7029000 at 16 Prinzregentenplatz
7029375 7031583 for an update on his V-1 rocket.
7038583 7042583 What kind of Nazi<br />kills the Führer?
7044208 7046875 The kind that believes<br />in victory, Dr. Jones.
7052125 7055959 Hitler lit a fire that could<br />have burned 1,000 years.
7056125 7057625 I saw every mistake.
7058417 7059709 Every blunder.
7059875 7061542 And I will correct them all.
7061709 7064333 History is a long list<br />of losses, Dr. Jones.
7065375 7066625 It's just a question of whose.
7079291 7080583 Stop!
7153291 7154291 Teddy.
7156125 7157485 You think you can fly<br />one of those?
7159125 7160125 A Nord?
7162834 7163834 Sure.
7164583 7165709 It's not a ringing response.
7165875 7167542 Well, I haven't flown a Nord.
7167709 7169250 You've never flown any plane.
7170458 7172250 I'll get it started.
7172417 7173667 No, Teddy.
7174834 7175834 Crap.
7203208 7204935 Fasten<br />your seat belt, Dr. Jones.
7204959 7206250 There might be some turbulence.
7207500 7209750 You're German, Voller.
7209917 7211917 Don't try and be funny.
7235291 7237125 Come on, big talker.
7251583 7252959 Okay.
7269792 7271375 Okay. Okay.
7271542 7274083 Gauges green. Power full.
7274750 7277250 And when I reach 85, I rotate.
7315000 7316417 Okay, wings down.
7318500 7320500 Okay, 84 miles an hour.
7320959 7322041 Rotate.
7399250 7400709 Continental drift.
7404125 7405333 Continental drift!
7407083 7409667 Archimedes didn't know<br />about continental drift.
7410500 7412667 He couldn't have!
7412750 7414667 It hadn't been observed yet.
7415667 7417500 You're off target.
7417959 7419834 Your coordinates<br />are based on markers
7420583 7423792 that have been moving<br />for 2,000 years!
7423959 7426792 You could be off<br />by 10 degrees, by...
7445083 7446083 <i>Herr</i> Voller...
7446166 7448208 Your calculations are wrong!
7449458 7451218 - <i>Herr </i>Voller...<br /><i>- </i>Will you shut up?
7451291 7452291 I'm thinking!
7459000 7460320 Hold the flight path!
7466917 7469375 I don't know<br />where we're going, Jürgen.
7471208 7472750 But it sure as hell
7473000 7474625 ain't 1939!
7578500 7579726 That's Sicily.
7579750 7580959 1939.
7582709 7584166 I did it.
7584333 7585834 I did it, Dr. Jones!
7594667 7596709 Yesterday<br />belongs to us, Dr. Jones.
7621583 7623750 Those are Roman triremes.
7652000 7653208 Keep it in the air!
7684542 7685917 Amazing.
7692583 7693583 Whoa!
7694875 7695875 Open the door!
7700834 7701834 What are you doing?
7702792 7704500 What are you doing, you idiots?
7704667 7706458 They think we're a monster!
7707000 7708000 Aah!
7712959 7714458 You have<br />to turn around.
7714625 7716542 This is the Siege of Syracuse.
7717667 7719000 214 BC.
7719166 7720375 You got the wrong war.
7752208 7753291 Boss!
7791333 7792893 Get out of the way!
7798709 7800834 How do you like that,<br />you savages?
7803875 7806625 Sorry, pal, but you're a Nazi!
7816667 7818750 What are you doing here?
7818917 7820458 Rescuing you!
7831083 7832875 Get him off!
7834291 7835375 Indy!
7841000 7842208 Parachute!
7845000 7846166 I got a parachute!
7847667 7849083 Hang on!
7852083 7853166 Let go!
7855500 7856875 Give me the parachute!
7862959 7865083 Grab it. Hang on!
7866625 7868375 Indy!
7921125 7923583 Hey,<br />those are my friends.
7923750 7925792 Those are my friends.<br />We need to help them!
7926959 7928542 Those are my friends!
8009000 8010059 He's trying to land.
8010083 8012041 Come on, Indy. Help me.
8012792 8014834 Get up. Yeah.
8015000 8017291 We need to get you<br />out of here. Okay.
8019208 8020500 Help me. Sit up, okay?
8021375 8022625 Sit up. You need to help me.
8022792 8024667 I know it hurts,<br />but we gotta get you back.
8024834 8027542 This is incredible, Wombat.
8028083 8030041 Incredible.
8031583 8033291 Yeah, it very well is.
8033458 8035041 But we have to<br />get you out of here.
8037166 8038291 My God.
8039959 8041834 We're witnessing history.
8048959 8050750 Reverse these numbers.
8050917 8052000 They'll get you home.
8053667 8054667 What?
8057583 8058792 I'm going to stay.
8059542 8061542 No. You're not serious.
8064375 8065417 Wow, you are serious.
8069500 8071125 Indy, you've been shot.
8071208 8072208 You're bleeding.
8072583 8074125 You can't stay here.
8074208 8075208 Yes, I can.
8075875 8076917 But for what? For...
8077000 8080542 For a long, painful death<br />with poultice and leeches?
8081583 8083709 I've imagined this, Wombat.
8084834 8086667 Studied it.
8086834 8088875 - All my life.<br />- Yeah.
8089041 8092041 And if you stay here,<br />you will muck it all up.
8092125 8093125 And die.
8093875 8095500 Please, get up.
8097250 8098417 Helena!
8098750 8099750 I did it!
8099917 8102250 Bravo, Teddy! Three cheers!
8102417 8104041 Okay. Indy, we've gotta go.<br />Get up.
8104125 8105643 I need to get you<br />into that plane, okay?
8105667 8106667 - We need to.<br />- No. No.
8106834 8109166 Get up. You can... We can!
8128583 8129583 It's him.
8138542 8140583 He's asking how far we've come.
8177208 8179041 That dial<br />is a forced deck.
8179125 8180583 It doesn't take us<br />anywhere but here.
8180750 8182041 He built it to get help.
8182208 8184750 Well, we just scared off<br />the entire Roman Navy,
8184834 8186017 so I think we've helped enough.
8190542 8191583 Helena...
8192792 8193851 He can't<br />keep that, by the way.
8193875 8194935 He needs to build his own one.
8194959 8196625 Helena, we need to go!
8197083 8199208 Indy, the window is closing!
8199375 8200500 We cannot get stuck here!
8206208 8208166 No, no, no!<br />Do not say yes!
8215166 8216166 Helena...
8225333 8226667 This is your time.
8228792 8230101 He needs to be in his.
8230125 8232417 His work is not done.<br />He needs to go home.
8232500 8234166 There is medicine at home.
8234250 8236125 He cannot die here. He can't.
8237792 8240625 Helena, get on the plane.
8243208 8244291 I'll be all right.
8246125 8247458 No, you won't.
8250458 8252208 I need to do this.
8253291 8254291 Me too.
8308792 8309792 Good morning.
8314667 8316041 How's the shoulder?
8318709 8321208 Better than my jaw.
8324834 8325834 Right.
8327834 8329333 You should've<br />let me stay.
8330208 8331417 I couldn't do that.
8340458 8341458 Why not?
8343333 8345875 Well, for starters, you'd have<br />changed the course of history.
8350208 8352000 That's supposed to be<br />a bad thing?
8356125 8357917 You're meant to be here, Indy.
8361709 8362709 Here.
8367834 8368959 For who?
8396291 8397875 Marion.
8399125 8400166 Hey.
8419458 8420458 Teddy.
8422083 8423083 Marion.
8425792 8426792 What are you doing?
8428333 8429500 Putting groceries away.
8431792 8434500 There wasn't a scrap of food<br />in this place.
8435417 8437417 No. Really.
8442208 8444417 Someone told me you were back.
8451875 8453500 Are you back, Indy?
8455125 8456834 It was explosives,
8457000 8459166 and Indy was running,<br />Marion was running,
8459333 8462000 and suddenly the plane exploded.
8465709 8467750 Indy, you're up and about.
8468959 8470333 Yes, I am.
8471458 8472458 Yes.
8473083 8475125 Why don't we go<br />and get some ice cream, kids?
8475291 8476651 But Marion<br />just bought some.
8476709 8477935 Oh,<br />I know a better place.
8477959 8480166 You can never have too much<br />ice cream, can you?
8483875 8484875 See you later.
8488458 8491375 <i>A British</i><br /><i>tar is a soaring soul</i>
8491542 8494375 <i>As free as a mountain bird</i>
8494542 8496375 <i>His energetic fist</i>
8496542 8498959 <i>Should be ready to resist...</i>
8500875 8502166 That looks bad.
8503667 8504917 Does it hurt?
8507458 8508917 Everything hurts.
8511792 8513417 I know how that feels.
8519500 8522125 Well, where doesn't it hurt?
8530709 8531709 Here.
8532500 8533750 It doesn't hurt here.
8542041 8543583 And here.
8567166 8569542 Jabari, Alia,<br />slow down!
8569709 8571834 Helena! Hurry up!
8572000 8574667 <i>I scream, you scream...</i>
8574834 8576959 Everybody, slow down.
8577125 8579267 <i>- I scream, you scream</i><br />- KIDS: <i>I scream, I scream</i>
8579291 8581000 <i>We all scream for ice cream!</i>
8581166 8583250 Slow down.
