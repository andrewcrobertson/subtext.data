1526083 1528667 But more than that, an inventor,
1528834 1531333 a brilliant engineer
1531500 1532917 who conceived of a way

1538875 1541542 on attacking Roman warships<br />and set them on fire.
1541709 1545208 Who devised giant iron claws
1545375 1547959 that could snatch hostiles<br />from the sea.

1843041 1845041 The Archimedes Dial.
1845709 1847125 The Antikythera.
1850083 1851417 What do you know about that?
1851959 1853291 Well, for starters,
1853458 1856834 in 1902, Greek sponge divers<br />found a wrecked Roman warship,
1857000 1858375 huge, off the coast of Greece.
1859000 1860709 Below deck, sealed in wax,
1860875 1862417 was a clock-like mechanism,
1862583 1865375 finely tooled, purpose unknown.
1865542 1867417 Nothing approximating<br />its complexity
1867500 1869500 appears in the world<br />for 1,000 years.
1870667 1872792 - You've done your homework.<br />- Well, not me.
1872959 1874375 Dad. He had<br />all these journals,
1874458 1876000 reams of notes about it.
1876166 1878000 He was obsessed till the end.
1880583 1881583 (SIGHS)
1881667 1883834 He told me you found it<br />on a Nazi plunder train.
1885291 1888375 And then lost it in a river<br />in the French Alps.
1890417 1892333 Hmm. Well, that was a long time ago.
1892500 1893959 And it was only half the Dial.
1894041 1895226 - Archimedes...<br />- Archimedes broke the Dial...
1895250 1896935 - disassembled it.<br />- In two, and then hid
1896959 1899101 the two halves from the Romans<br />during the siege of Syracuse.
1899125 1900333 I know. Look.
1901417 1903417 You don't remember the last<br />time I saw you, do you?
1904959 1906083 Remember what?
1906166 1907166 These are the Alps.
1908625 1910208 Yeah, I see.
1910375 1912125 And this is the route<br />that your train took
1912208 1913250 from the Nazi stronghold
1913333 1914333 - in '44.<br />- Right.
1914500 1916291 HELENA: It went through<br />this mountain pass,
1916458 1918000 and then here.
1918166 1920000 Here, it's the only river<br />on the route.
1920083 1921625 - Right.<br />- Under a bridge.
1921792 1923166 It's down there.<br />It's got to be.
1923333 1925750 - And nobody knows except us.<br />- "Us"?
1926041 1927542 Well, I mean, you.
1927709 1929250 And me. So, yeah.
1929417 1931250 - Us.<br />- Us.
1932250 1934750 And what were you<br />thinking exactly?
1936208 1937291 Well, that maybe...
1939125 1940667 we could go there.

2078667 2081750 Basil became obsessed<br />by this German theory.
2083291 2084709 Conjecture, really.
2087250 2088875 Archimedes had figured out
2088959 2091959 that the movements<br />of the moon and planets
2092834 2094041 weren't perfect.
2095291 2097792 There were irregularities<br />in their rotations.
2098959 2101250 He thought these<br />irregularities might
2101417 2104792 explain fluctuations<br />in temperature, tides.
2106917 2108208 Storms, even.
2109583 2112458 So, he set about building<br />a device to predict them.
2114166 2115959 But then, he stumbled upon
2116041 2118083 a method to predict even larger
2118834 2119834 disturbances.
2121709 2123125 Larger disturbances?
2123750 2126000 Your father<br />thought this thing could

2217834 2219709 I took that from him then.

2223000 2224059 But your father was convinced
2224083 2227083 this thing was real<br />and dangerous.

2239667 2240667 and put the two together.

4320291 4321726 It's directions<br />to the rest of the Dial.
4321750 4323309 Ask her if she knows<br />what language it's in.
4323333 4325333 Ah! It isn't in a language.<br />It's in a code.
4325500 4326709 What code?
4326875 4328333 Archimedes used two codes.
4328500 4330041 Linear B and Polybius Square.
4330208 4331834 So, even if you find<br />the Grafikos,

4515208 4517208 Dad tracked down<br />the old sponge diver
4517291 4518917 who found the Dial.
4519083 4520250 He told him
4520417 4523375 that the wrecked Roman ship<br />broke up under the sea
4523542 4524667 70 feet below.
4524834 4527792 Filled with the skeletons<br />of over 100 centurions.
4528959 4530125 That's where they found it.
4530875 4534792 But he said that most<br />of the ship had broken off
4534959 4536709 and sunk to the ocean floor.
4537667 4539250 Too deep for sponge divers.
4540291 4543166 So, Dad started wondering<br />why a Roman warship
4543333 4546709 would sail out of Syracuse<br />with 100 centurions on board.
4550417 4553792 They weren't taking<br />half a Dial for a joyride.

5452291 5453291 that's "machine"...

5544542 5545875 There are nine Muses.
5546041 5547166 The <i>Museon.</i>
5547333 5549792 The Greek word for the<br />Great Library of Alexandria.

5558375 5561125 The nine Muses,<br />in reverse order,
