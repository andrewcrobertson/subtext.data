45838 46923 On your feet!
68027 69237 An American, Colonel.
69528 71530 He was at the gate,<br />impersonating an officer.
78079 79205 You were alone?
80831 83751 Spy, you were alone?
83834 85336 I like to be alone.
86712 88381 What did you come here for?
89257 91717 You got a lot of nice stuff.
91884 93177 Other people's stuff.
94929 97014 "To the victor<br />belongs the spoils."
98266 99433 "To the victor"?
100434 101894 Berlin's in rubble.
101978 103729 The Führer's in hiding.
104939 106649 You lost.
110569 112029 Take him upstairs.
112613 114573 What? What? Hey!
114740 115825 Hey, wait a second. Guys!
115992 117285 A moment. Please!
118077 119578 Stop! I must speak to the commander.
119870 121747 Colonel. I found it!
123833 125209 Do as he says. Open it.
130589 131590 Doctor.
139598 141600 The Lance of Longinus.
143144 145438 The blade that drew Christ's blood.
146314 147315 The Holy Lance.
157867 160036 Double the guard.<br />This is the prize the Führer seeks.
160202 161202 Colonel, we need to talk.
161245 162413 No time, Doctor.
162663 164040 The train to Berlin is waiting.
165541 166541 Search the woods!
166667 167667 Take the dogs.
168544 169920 Do you think that spy was alone?
170546 172048 Go! Go! Go! We're moving out!
172340 173340 On the double!
199075 200159 Looks like<br />they're leaving
200242 201535 without you guys.
202828 204955 Tell us your story, or die.
205748 207083 Story. Um...
207958 209794 Okay, okay.
209960 211712 Well...
211796 213255 It all started
213964 218010 once upon a time,<br />when this village
218094 222723 of stupid blue-eyed boys<br />decided to join hands together
222807 224892 and follow this sweaty<br />little pied piper
224975 226727 named Adolf...
325910 327995 This man<br />was with the American.
329747 330831 This is the American's bag.
332708 333708 What have I done?
338255 339590 Bring him to my carriage.
347473 350267 Careful. This is the Führer's<br />special relic!
368202 369537 Heil Hitler!
379838 381131 Stay seated.
382007 383342 So...
386220 388138 you are a birdwatcher?
391809 393686 Yes. Because of the bombing,
393978 396605 the wagtails are following<br />a completely different trajectory.
400568 402278 We caught your accomplice.
403487 404989 The American.
470929 472181 Oh, my!
497790 498999 Get off of me!
527277 528487 There's one reason
528570 530072 you're still alive,<br />birdwatcher.
532616 534159 Who sent you?
534326 535494 What was your mission?
535661 537663 Please, Colonel, no.<br />I beg you.
537830 540124 My name is Basil Shaw.
541375 543335 I'm a professor at Oxford.
543419 544837 An archeologist.
552344 553429 There you are.
557599 559560 There is a problem.
560728 562020 I must speak to the Colonel.
562521 563522 It's urgent.
566608 568569 I have a daughter. I beg you.
569236 571947 I guarantee you will never see<br />your child again, Mr. Shaw.
573991 578245 Unless you explain<br />why your accomplice had this.
587546 588797 Sieg heil!
600809 603020 We were fold<br />that the Lance of Longinus
603103 604938 could be found<br />at the fortress.
605856 607274 We were looking for it.
607775 608776 Why?
610360 611361 Because of its power?
612529 615199 It has no power.
617868 620496 My friend and I<br />were trying to save history.
623123 624583 I must<br />speak with the Colonel.
625876 626919 It's about the Lance.
673674 675050 I only had a moment to look at it.
675259 676969 Of course, my training is in physics,
677469 679429 For God's sake, spit it out!
681515 682515 The Lance...
684935 686645 It's a fake.
687271 688271 It's a fake.
688522 689648 A fake?
691900 693443 The blade is an alloy.
693610 694945 Fifty years old,
695153 697281 the engravings recent. It's a replica.
697489 698490 We're dead.
701118 702244 Twelfth century.
702327 703537 Thirteenth century.
704288 705831 Ramesses II.
707249 708959 None of this stuff is fake.
711795 713380 I gotta stop this train.
713714 715194 There is another relic on this train.
716216 717634 One with real power.
718093 719219 What are you talking about?
721263 722263 The Antikythera.
722890 723557 The Antikythera?!
723807 725809 Enough about that old dial!
726059 728228 Colonel, the Führer has lost the war...
728645 730022 and his mind!
732357 733567 Let me explain.
735569 738030 The Antikythera's power<br />is not supernatural.
738488 740365 It is mathematics.
742075 743577 Whoever harnesses it...
745662 747164 will not be King...
747915 748916 nor Emperor...
750292 751501 or Führer.
755005 756798 He will be God.
775317 776860 Too many Nazis.
780697 783325 And how do you propose we tell him this?
783992 784992 My Führer,
785369 787412 I'm sorry the Lance of Christ is fake.
787663 788830 But here is...
790248 793001 half of something you've never heard of.
794544 795544 Tell me,
795963 797464 have you ever MET HITLER?!!
800050 801134 A saboteur aboard.
801343 802636 And Hitler's Lance is gone.
842926 843927 Sieg heil!
844011 845220 That way!
848890 850183 What are you doing here?!
857566 858817 What the hell?
859818 861111 Indy?
861194 862195 Baz?
862529 863530 You're alive!
864239 865240 So far.
866116 868326 I thought I told you<br />to stay in the woods, Baz.
868493 870454 What sort of a man<br />hides in a hedge
870537 872539 while his friend<br />is facing death?
885761 889514 This lot are carting off<br />half the world's antiquities.
889681 892726 I was gonna stop 'em,<br />but now I've gotta rescue you.
893351 894811 Did you at least<br />find the Lance?
895020 896021 "At least"?
896104 897481 Well, have you got it?
897564 899399 - It's a fake.<br />- What?
899858 901401 A reproduction.
904237 905237 Who are you?
909618 910619 Indy?
919544 920837 The Antikythera.
922005 923673 Archimedes' Dial.
925217 926218 Bring it.
943944 945070 Hurry up, Baz.
947989 949366 Give me that.
949533 950659 Come on.
965298 966883 Get up, Baz.
967050 968260 Follow me.
968927 970220 Towards the gun?
970387 971680 Away from the Nazis!
972097 974057 Those are Nazis!
974599 976601 Get down! Down! Down!
1025859 1027027 This way. Come on!
1027611 1028612 I can't do that!
1028778 1030697 You wanna stop<br />for a little lie-down?
1034492 1035869 They have the Antikythera!
1036244 1038288 Easy.
1069194 1070195 Tunnel!
1080997 1082540 Got you! No!
1122956 1124207 Indy!
1132382 1133466 Get the gun!
1142642 1144060 Shoot him!
1146229 1148064 Not me!
1148440 1150191 S-Sorry.
1169502 1171504 To the victor go the spoils.
1202494 1204204 Drop the gun.
1206956 1208500 Give me the Antikythera.
1219552 1220970 Indy!
1231773 1232774 Hey!
1235860 1238196 - Here!<br />- They can't hear you, Baz.
1238738 1240115 We gotta jump!
1240281 1241616 What about my dicky knee?
1242117 1243326 Ahh!
1248581 1249582 Baz!
1250500 1251501 Baz!
1253336 1254379 Baz!
1255713 1257382 - Indy!<br />- Baz!
1262679 1264305 Go! Move! Move it!
1265932 1268810 Bit rum to go home<br />empty-handed after all that.
1269394 1270603 "Empty-handed"?
1270687 1271896 Not exactly.
1274899 1276025 Archimedes' Dial.
1276192 1277235 Well, half of it.
1277402 1279612 Come on, Baz. Let's get home.
1324699 1327285 Roll up, roll up<br />for the Magical Mystery Tour
1327368 1329204 Step right this way
1329287 1332081 Roll up
1332165 1334959 Roll up for the Mystery Tour
1335043 1337754 Roll up
1337837 1340590 Roll up for the Mystery Tour
1340673 1343468 -Roll up<br />-That's an invitation
1343551 1344886 Roll up for the...
1344969 1347597 Larry! Turn it down!
1348640 1349891 Turn it down!
1350058 1351893 Hey, Larry!
1352477 1357106 The Magical Mystery Tour<br />is waiting to take you away
1357857 1360360 Waiting to take you away
1361486 1366533 Roll up<br />Roll up for the Mystery Tour
1366616 1367617 Larry!
1369118 1370119 Larry!
1370203 1371746 - Hi, Mr. Jones.<br />- Where's Larry?
1373081 1375083 - Who is this guy?<br />- It's the old guy next door.
1375250 1376876 Larry, it's 8:00<br />in the morning.
1377043 1379420 - "It's 8:00 in the morning."<br />- We talked about this, Larry.
1379504 1380630 Yeah, but that was
1380713 1383174 - a workday, Mr. Jones.<br />- This is a workday too, Larry!
1384551 1385718 Turn on the news.
1385885 1387929 It's moon day, Mr. Jones.
1388388 1389597 Moon day?
1402610 1407865 And the papers want to know<br />whose shirts you wear
1409701 1415415 Now it's time to leave<br />the capsule if you dare
1417667 1422005 This is Major Tom<br />to Ground Control
1422505 1425967 I'm stepping through the door
1427635 1433224 And I'm floating<br />in a most peculiar way
1434601 1440648 And the stars look<br />very different today
1442984 1444068 Thanks.
1457415 1459250 All you really<br />need to remember
1459417 1463004 is that Assyrian ceramics of this period<br />are characterized
1463171 1467133 by this complex<br />blue-line pattern.
1467300 1468301 Okay?
1469385 1472764 I assigned pages 131<br />through 171
1472930 1474557 in Winford for today.
1474724 1476225 Anybody do the reading?
1478519 1479520 Anyone?
1482315 1484359 This is on the test.
1484525 1485735 Okay.
1486944 1488946 Guess I'll spoon-feed it<br />to you.
1491824 1494452 In 213 BC,
1494619 1496621 Roman forces led by Marcellus
1496788 1499624 laid siege<br />to the city of Syracuse.
1499791 1501459 "Syracuse."
1502919 1505505 Not the Syracuse<br />in New York, Tonya.
1505672 1507256 The one in Sicily.
1508049 1510426 Amongst the defenders<br />of the city
1510593 1513680 was its most famous resident,<br />who was...
1515890 1517600 Come on, guys.<br />This is on the final.
1518309 1519894 Archimedes.
1520770 1521813 Archimedes.
1521979 1523314 Archimedes, who was a...
1523481 1524607 A mathematician.
1524774 1525942 A mathematician.
1526109 1528695 But more than that,<br />an inventor,
1528861 1531364 a brilliant engineer
1531531 1532949 who conceived of a way
1533032 1535827 to harness the energy<br />of the Mediterranean sun
1535910 1538746 on concave mirrors<br />and focus it
1538913 1541582 on attacking Roman warships<br />and set them on fire.
1541749 1545211 Who devised giant iron claws
1545378 1547964 that could snatch hostiles<br />from the sea.
1550550 1553428 But how do we know<br />it really happened?
1554554 1558558 What physical, irrefutable<br />archeological evidence
1558725 1562061 - is there of these inventions?<br />- The Antikythera.
1563438 1565606 - The Antikythera.<br />- For starters.
1565773 1567775 They're here!<br />They're downtown!
1569736 1571070 The astronauts.
1571237 1573656 Giant parade<br />this morning will be seen
1573740 1575450 by about<br />two and a half million people
1575533 1576868 lining the sidewalks...
1579912 1581330 He's coming.<br />He's come. See?
1581497 1582915 Oh, here he comes.
1583875 1584876 Hide the cake.
1586586 1588671 - Surprise.<br />- Surprise!
1592800 1595970 For over a decade now,<br />our colleague Dr. Jones
1596053 1598639 has been a loyal servant<br />of Hunter.
1600057 1601642 A token of our gratitude.
1608983 1610777 Wow.
1614322 1616199 Thanks for putting up with me.
1630630 1631714 Here.
1640181 1642391 Astronauts<br />Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins,
1642475 1645353 and Buzz Aldrin will not be<br />able to avoid the spotlight.
1645520 1647438 At 11:00 a.m.<br />Eastern Daylight Time,
1647522 1649232 a grateful nation<br />will pay homage
1649398 1652026 with a ticker-tape parade<br />through New York and Chicago,
1652193 1653694 climaxed by a dinner<br />in Los Angeles...
1653861 1655196 What would the ancients say?
1655655 1657448 Neil, Buzz, and Mike...
1657615 1660368 If they knew<br />we walked on the moon?
1660535 1662078 Speaking as an ancient,
1662245 1664705 going to the moon<br />is like going to Reno.
1664872 1666165 Middle of nowhere
1667375 1668835 and no blackjack.
1669877 1671504 You don't recognize me,<br />do you?
1673840 1675883 Whatever I did, I apologize.
1676843 1677885 It's Helena.
1679470 1680513 Helena Shaw.
1682390 1683641 Wombat?
1683724 1685351 Wow, I haven't<br />heard that in a while.
1686060 1687645 - You got tall.<br />- I did.
1687812 1689105 It's fair to say.
1691232 1692316 I'm celebrating.
1693442 1695653 - I'm retiring.<br />- Oh.
1696153 1697953 Wow. Well, in that case,<br />what are we drinking?
1703077 1704829 Room service for Mr. Schmidt.
1717341 1718384 Put that away.
1718467 1721012 I was asking how you broke<br />your ankle.
1721095 1723097 - None of your business.<br />- Are you Mr. Schmidt?
1723264 1725391 "Doctor" Schmidt.<br />He's in there.
1725558 1727059 And he don't eat anything<br />on wheels,
1727143 1728352 so put it on a table.
1729812 1731105 When I was a little boy,
1731606 1732773 I always imagined
1732940 1736652 that one day<br />man would walk on the moon.
1737194 1738321 And by golly...
1744952 1746662 Quite a celebration<br />out there, hmm?
1750082 1751542 The man you're serving,
1751709 1754003 he's the one who put<br />those astronauts on the moon.
1754170 1755370 Built the rockets<br />they rode in.
1756631 1757882 Congratulations.
1758132 1759133 Where are you from?
1760134 1761135 The Bronx, sir.
1761218 1763179 No, no. I mean originally,<br />your people.
1763346 1764347 Do you know?
1768976 1770686 I was born<br />by Yankee Stadium, sir.
1773272 1775107 And you fought<br />for your country?
1776067 1777485 320th Battalion.
1777652 1780029 Set up balloons to stop<br />the planes bombing Normandy.
1785534 1787370 And are you enjoying<br />your victory?
1795169 1796253 Will there be<br />anything else?
1798798 1800007 You didn't win the war.
1801676 1802802 Hitler lost it.
1808432 1809517 Yeah.
1810559 1813229 My field agent,<br />she found Shaw.
1814230 1815439 Yeah, I'm coming.
1815606 1816607 Let's go, Hauke.
1819944 1821195 Where are we here?
1822279 1823781 Oxford. In the garden.
1826075 1827368 He was an original.
1829787 1831205 I just graduated.
1831372 1832373 In Archeology.
1833332 1835459 Archeology. Wow.
1835626 1837169 Apple didn't fall far.
1837336 1840047 Well, now I'm researching<br />a doctorate.
1841257 1842258 What's your subject?
1843050 1845052 The Archimedes Dial.
1845720 1847138 The Antikythera.
1850099 1851434 What do you know about that?
1851976 1853310 Well, for starters,
1853477 1856856 in 1902, Greek sponge divers<br />found a wrecked Roman warship,
1857023 1858399 huge, off the coast of Greece.
1859025 1860735 Below deck, sealed in wax,
1860901 1862445 was a clock-like mechanism,
1862611 1865406 finely tooled,<br />purpose unknown.
1865573 1867450 Nothing approximating<br />its complexity
1867533 1869535 appears in the world<br />for 1,000 years.
1870703 1872830 - You've done your homework.<br />- Well, not me.
1872997 1874415 Dad. He had<br />all these journals,
1874498 1876000 reams of notes about it.
1876167 1878002 He was obsessed till the end.
1881672 1883841 He told me you found it<br />on a Nazi plunder train.
1885301 1888387 And then lost it in a river<br />in the French Alps.
1890431 1892349 Hmm. Well, that was a long time ago.
1892516 1893976 And it was only half the Dial.
1894060 1895245 - Archimedes...<br />- Archimedes broke the Dial...
1895269 1896955 - ...disassembled it.<br />- ...in two, and then hid
1896979 1899124 the two halves from the Romans<br />during the siege of Syracuse.
1899148 1900357 I know. Look.
1901442 1903442 You don't remember the last<br />time I saw you, do you?
1904987 1906113 Remember what?
1906197 1907198 These are the Alps.
1908657 1910242 Yeah, I see.
1910409 1912161 And this is the route<br />that your train took
1912244 1913287 from the Nazi stronghold
1913370 1914371 - in '44.<br />- Right.
1914538 1916332 It went through<br />this mountain pass,
1916499 1918000 and then here.
1918167 1920002 Here, it's the only river<br />on the route.
1920086 1921629 - Right.<br />- Under a bridge.
1921796 1923172 It's down there.<br />It's got to be.
1923339 1925758 - And nobody knows except us.<br />- "Us"?
1926050 1927551 Well, I mean, you.
1927718 1929261 And me. So, yeah.
1929428 1931263 - Us.<br />- Us.
1932264 1934767 And what were you<br />thinking exactly?
1936227 1937311 Well, that maybe...
1939146 1940689 we could go there.
1940856 1941899 And?
1942066 1943150 And find it. And...
1944068 1945694 And I'd become...
1947321 1948489 famous.
1948656 1950950 Oh, well, not famous.<br />Renowned. Feted.
1951534 1953327 A feted archeologist.
1953494 1955204 And you, a final triumph!
1955287 1956413 Indiana Jones!
1956497 1958541 Out with a bang!<br />Back in the saddle!
1961585 1963003 I'm not selling this, am I?
1965506 1966715 Wombat...
1968843 1970678 why are you chasing the thing
1972429 1974515 that drove your father crazy?
1980479 1981897 Wouldn't you?
2000124 2001125 I got it.
2001208 2002209 Parade's coming soon.
2003252 2004253 So, what we got?
2006005 2008382 She's in there, third floor,<br />with an old guy.
2008549 2009675 Who is he, a Russian?
2009842 2011760 No, a professor.<br />Dr. Henry Jones.
2012845 2013846 Klaber!
2014346 2016432 Klaber, get back here!<br />You're not an agent!
2016599 2017892 God damn it! Go.
2018058 2020644 I'll get support up here<br />and pull a file on Jones.
2041290 2042541 This way.
2078702 2081789 Basil became obsessed<br />by this German theory.
2083332 2084708 Conjecture, really.
2087253 2088879 Archimedes had figured out
2088963 2091966 that the movements<br />of the moon and planets
2092841 2094051 weren't perfect.
2095302 2097805 There were irregularities<br />in their rotations.
2098973 2101267 He thought these<br />irregularities might
2101433 2104812 explain fluctuations<br />in temperature, tides.
2106939 2108232 Storms, even.
2109608 2112486 So, he set about building<br />a device to predict them.
2114196 2115990 But then, he stumbled upon
2116073 2118117 a method to predict<br />even larger
2118867 2119868 disturbances.
2121745 2123163 Larger disturbances?
2123789 2126000 Your father<br />thought this thing could
2126709 2128961 predict fissures in time.
2145978 2147479 Hauke, if you don't...
2149898 2152109 Found 'em.
2159658 2160743 Hello.
2161785 2163996 Are you looking for...
2164163 2165331 Dr. Jones?
2169001 2170252 Excuse me, can I help you?
2170836 2171837 No, thank you.
2171920 2173630 Just a routine investigation,<br />ma'am.
2174715 2177217 Are you the police?
2177301 2178719 It'll just be a few moments.
2178886 2180596 - Professor Plimpton.<br />- Ma'am.
2180679 2181839 - Professor Plimpton!<br />- Ma'am!
2186393 2187394 Drop your weapon.
2187770 2188830 What the hell are you doing?
2188854 2189980 Um...
2190064 2192232 What the doctor tells me,<br />Miss Mason.
2192316 2193317 Mandy?
2197946 2199990 Yeah, no witnesses.
2204370 2206455 Jesus. What the hell?
2206747 2208123 Your father wrote<br />SO many letters
2208207 2210042 about the Dial,<br />I stopped reading 'em.
2213170 2214171 You really don't remember
2214254 2215881 the last time<br />I was at your house?
2217841 2219718 I took that from him then.
2221345 2222945 I thought he'd stopped<br />thinking about it.
2223013 2224074 But your father was convinced
2224098 2227101 this thing was real<br />and dangerous.
2227267 2229228 Do not shoot.
2229645 2233065 He was terrified that if somebody found<br />this legendary tablet,
2233232 2234358 the Grafikos...
2234525 2235585 The tablet<br />containing directions
2235609 2236693 to the rest of the Dial.
2236860 2238060 And if they found<br />the Grafikos,
2238153 2239672 they might acquire<br />the other half of the Dial
2239696 2240697 and put the two together.
2242366 2243575 I knew<br />you wouldn't destroy it.
2247204 2249039 How did you know<br />he asked me to destroy it?
2249915 2251917 - What?<br />- You do remember that night.
2252668 2254586 I was 12 years old, Indy.
2254670 2256150 You knew we didn't drop it<br />in a river.
2256922 2258841 - Baz didn't tell you that.<br />- See, listen.
2258924 2260244 - I didn't...<br />- No, he never lied.
2260717 2261969 - No...<br />- What was all that crap
2262052 2263095 - about the map?<br />- You...
2263262 2264542 No, you've had<br />too many whiskeys.
2265180 2266241 What are you doing, Wombat?
2266265 2267599 Stay where you are.
2268809 2269810 Don't move.
2270561 2272122 - Who are these people?<br />- We need to get out of here.
2272146 2273147 Are they with you?
2273230 2274481 Not an inch, Miss Shaw.
2275691 2276692 Miss Shaw, stop!
2280362 2281363 Helena!
2286160 2287161 Stop!
2289121 2290122 Sorry.
2290205 2293167 - Helena!<br />- Dr. Jones. It's over.
2293333 2294543 Who are you people?
2294710 2295794 What do you want?
2297629 2298630 Stop!
2300716 2301717 Helena Shaw!
2301800 2303319 She's on the roof.<br />Find another way up.
2303343 2304428 Dr. Jones!
2304887 2306287 Dr. Jones,<br />we're not gonna hurt you.
2332789 2334082 Move.<br />We gotta follow 'em.
2334166 2335292 Go. Hurry up.
2362861 2363862 Fan out!
2376667 2378228 All right, let's go.<br />Move, move, move! Pack it up!
2378252 2379253 Come on,<br />get everything.
2379419 2380546 Found her!
2408991 2411285 - Operator.<br />- I need the police.
2411451 2413745 Hunter College.<br />People are dead.
2413829 2414997 - Please...<br />- Hang up, fella.
2420877 2421962 Stand up.
2427426 2428510 Okay, okay.
2452868 2454328 She's gone. You blew it,
2454494 2455746 you trigger-happy cracker.
2455912 2458373 - She had it in her hand.<br />- We got the professor.
2461960 2463128 Here's the file on Jones.
2463211 2464212 Yes.
2482481 2483523 Who are you?
2483690 2485150 That's my question.
2495661 2497120 You're CIA.
2497287 2499039 Oh, not me, man.
2499206 2501166 I don't take government jobs.
2501333 2502417 Okay.
2503710 2505879 How are you acquainted<br />with Miss Shaw?
2506254 2507506 She's my goddaughter.
2508256 2509883 I haven't seen her<br />in 18 years.
2510050 2511194 Why did you<br />meet with her today?
2511218 2512219 To give her the Dial?
2513595 2516056 Lady, it's an ancient<br />hunk of gears.
2517015 2518058 Half a hunk.
2518141 2519810 Oh, it's a lot more than that.
2521561 2522729 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
2522813 2524064 Where do you think<br />you're going?
2524231 2525607 I got a parade going on.
2525774 2527234 And a demonstration<br />coming down here.
2527401 2528443 Hey! Hey, hey!
2529111 2530153 - Hey...<br />- Shut up.
2530320 2532739 I can't go this way.<br />Gotta go back.
2537744 2539496 Hell no!<br />What is wrong with you, man?
2539663 2541289 Damn it! Let's go on foot.
2541456 2542541 You heard her.
2544209 2545353 What the hell<br />were you thinking?
2545377 2546729 - Walk! Come on.<br />- What is your problem?
2546753 2547814 You don't look<br />when you're backing up?
2547838 2549440 - Take care of that guy.<br />- Who's gonna pay for that?
2549464 2550590 Easy, fella. Easy.
2550674 2551675 Keep moving.
2551758 2553510 Can't you see my cab?<br />It's yellow.
2553593 2555238 No, you're gonna have to pay<br />for this bodywork, man.
2555262 2556263 I don't...
2558140 2560434 Peace now!<br />Peace now!
2561852 2564688 Stop the war!<br />Stop the fighting!
2564855 2566606 - Where are we going, Mason?<br />- This way.
2568650 2570235 - Hell no, we won't go.<br />- Shut up.
2570402 2571820 - Hell no, we won't go!<br />- Hell no!
2572154 2574698 - Hell no, we won't go!<br />- Hell no, we won't go!
2574781 2575782 We won't go!
2575949 2578326 - Hell no, we won't go!<br />- Hell no, we won't go!
2578910 2580328 - Hell no...<br />- Shut up!
2580495 2581496 Hell yeah!
2581788 2583665 Hell no, we won't go!
2583749 2585584 Hell no, we won't go!
2585667 2589129 Hell no, we won't go!<br />Hell no, we won't go!
2589212 2591465 Hell no, we won't go!<br />Hell no, we won't go!
2591548 2592549 Hell no...
2592966 2596511 Hell no, we won't go!<br />Hell no, we won't go!
2603477 2604770 Hey!
2605228 2607230 Officer! Help me!
2607981 2609566 Officer,<br />there was a shooting...
2609649 2611627 - All right, all right.<br />- ...this morning at Hunter.
2611651 2613403 People are dead. God damn it.
2613487 2615197 Some rogue maniacs<br />broke in and...
2615280 2616907 Sir, you need to calm it down.
2617073 2618283 Please listen to me.
2618450 2620577 There was a shooting<br />this morning, and the...
2620744 2624164 They're in a Con Ed van<br />right around the corner!
2626750 2628376 Hey! What do you think<br />you're doing?
2639471 2640472 Whoa!
2640555 2641890 - Watch out!<br />- What's he doing?
2641973 2643058 Whoa!
2677634 2678635 Hyah! Hyah!
2691106 2692941 - Move, out the way!<br />- Whoa, whoa!
2694985 2696611 Hyah!
2700282 2701533 - Watch out!<br />- Hyah!
2701908 2703368 Whoa. Whoa.
2703451 2704619 Move! Quickly!
2709958 2711293 Hyah!
2718884 2720302 Move! Move!
2730896 2732230 Go, go, go!
2736735 2737736 Hyah!
2748622 2749831 Hyah!
2752876 2754961 Come on.<br />That's ridiculous.
2755045 2756546 - It's a horse.<br />- Come on.
2759049 2760884 - Hey, mister.<br />- Move! Out of the way!
2761217 2763011 - Hold my horse.<br />- Move! Move!
2763094 2764095 Transfer is available
2764179 2766264 for IND Queens Boulevard.
2775690 2778693 Next stop, 59th,<br />Lexington Avenue.
2780570 2782864 - Subway is faster.<br />- Oh!
2783365 2785116 People tend<br />to romanticize science,
2785200 2787160 when it is, in fact,<br />quite cold.
2787327 2788828 So, what's next,<br />Dr. Schmidt?
2789955 2791039 Mars?
2791831 2793249 No, we've conquered space.
2795085 2796795 I'm moving<br />to the next frontier.
2798254 2800674 What's beyond space?
2804302 2806221 You might wanna<br />get that suit pressed,
2806304 2807305 Dr. Schmidt.
2807931 2809557 We leave for the airport<br />in an hour.
2809933 2811077 He's gonna meet the President.
2811101 2812741 If the President objects<br />to a few creases,
2812769 2815105 perhaps he should find himself<br />another physicist.
2816106 2817941 - Can I use that?<br />- No.
2818316 2819401 Yes.
2819484 2821528 Baxter.
2825699 2826825 It's for you, Doctor.
2830578 2832706 I may wanna leave a bit later<br />for Los Angeles.
2832789 2835041 I'm expecting<br />a delivery shortly.
2838211 2839212 Speak.
2839295 2840797 Your goons made a mess.
2840964 2842132 Did they?
2842298 2844718 Miss Shaw met<br />with a professor. Jones.
2845343 2847095 She acquired the device<br />from him.
2848013 2849097 Then we lost her.
2850765 2852434 Dr. Jones got away as well.
2852851 2854019 Ls that so?
2854185 2855520 Most unfortunate.
2855895 2857355 I gotta clean things<br />up here, Doctor.
2857439 2858440 And as a represent alive
2858523 2859983 of the United States<br />government,
2860066 2861776 I urge you to cooperate.
2861860 2863153 Get on that plane<br />to Los Angeles,
2864070 2865550 and get your medal<br />from the President.
2872954 2874039 Hello?
2874539 2876708 Call our friends<br />and secure a private charter.
2878126 2879127 To Morocco.
2879210 2880378 Yes, sir.
2881296 2882547 The university murders
2882630 2884591 took place at the height<br />of the parade.
2884674 2885759 Police are searching
2885842 2888094 for retired professor<br />Dr. Henry Jones.
2888261 2891264 A colleague told ABC that<br />Jones recently lost his son
2891431 2893433 and was in the middle<br />of a divorce.
2895643 2898855 This guy,<br />he looks like you.
2899814 2902192 Nah. No.
2904152 2906154 - It is you.<br />- No, no, no. Hey.
2906237 2907923 - Go home, pal. You're drunk.<br />- This is the guy!
2907947 2909282 - Hey!<br />- It's the killer!
2911951 2913369 Sorry I'm late, Indy.
2913536 2914954 Bridge traffic.
2925840 2928009 Boy, am I glad<br />to see you, Sallah.
2928843 2930845 I wish I could say the same,<br />old friend.
2934140 2936059 Quickly, Indy. Inside.
2939854 2942148 Your goddaughter, Helena,
2942315 2944984 was arrested in Tangier<br />last year
2945068 2947904 for auctioning contraband.
2950365 2951449 There's more.
2952492 2955912 She was bailed out<br />by Aziz Rahim.
2956663 2959582 Aziz Rahim is the son<br />of Big Rahim,
2959666 2962418 a well-known Moroccan mobster.
2963962 2967632 Big Rahim<br />owns the Hotel Atlantique
2967799 2970385 in Tangier, and this week,
2970552 2974681 the hotel is hosting<br />its annual auction
2974848 2976724 of stolen antiquities.
2977892 2980395 All the big players<br />are already there.
2980562 2982355 Alia, Jabari.
2982522 2984774 This is the great man<br />who brought our family
2984858 2986693 to America during the war.
2986860 2989237 Quick, when was<br />the Suez Crisis?
2989320 2991781 1956.
2992240 2993616 Very impressive, Jabari.
2993783 2996202 My grandchildren watch<br />too much TV,
2996369 2998913 but they know their history.
2999080 3003209 They understand what it is<br />to be American and Egyptian.
3004085 3006254 I need a ride<br />to the airport, Sallah.
3007338 3009841 If you run, the police will<br />assume that you're guilty.
3010550 3011885 Without Helena or the Dial,
3011968 3013887 I'm gonna get framed<br />for murder.
3015054 3016681 Have you thought<br />about calling Marion?
3017765 3019100 She doesn't wanna talk to me.
3025273 3026482 Welcome to New York's
3026566 3028860 John F. Kennedy<br />International Airport.
3029694 3031988 The upper level is<br />for Pan American Airlines...
3032155 3033990 I took something else<br />from your apartment.
3034157 3035366 It was under the bed.
3040580 3041623 Thanks, Sallah.
3043875 3045668 I also brought my passport.
3047712 3048922 I could help you.
3049088 3050089 In Tangier?
3050173 3051799 Wherever chance takes us.
3052717 3053801 Indy, I...
3054719 3056179 I miss the desert.
3056763 3058056 I miss the sea.
3059599 3061392 And I miss waking up<br />every morning
3061559 3062977 wondering what<br />wonderful adventure
3063061 3064687 the new day will bring to us.
3065647 3067649 This is not<br />an adventure, Sallah.
3069108 3071694 Those days have come and gone.
3071861 3072904 Perhaps.
3073071 3074405 Perhaps not.
3078868 3081287 Give 'em hell, Indiana Jones!
3093091 3094175 Champagne?
3094550 3096427 We've got four more hours<br />to Tangier.
3104185 3105603 Your scotch, sir.
3106229 3107230 Thanks.
3114153 3115530 Basil. Come on, Baz!
3115697 3117448 - Open the door!<br />- No!
3117615 3119117 - Stay out, Indy!<br />- Open the door.
3122328 3124205 The Germans were right, Indy.
3124289 3126666 - Huh? What?<br />- It's too big. It's too much.
3126833 3128501 Hey, Ba... Hey, hey! Hey, Baz!
3128584 3129585 - Give me...<br />- No.
3129669 3130670 What are you doing?
3130753 3132022 You've listened<br />to nothing that I said.
3132046 3133840 I don't understand it, Baz!
3134173 3136173 Well, I was trying to<br />explain it to you downstairs.
3136217 3137510 You've just<br />ignored everything.
3137593 3138833 You're terrifying<br />your daughter.
3140763 3142849 Indy, Archimedes
3143016 3145226 discovered<br />a temporal meteorology.
3145435 3148062 Archimedes was<br />a mathematician, Baz,
3148229 3149439 not a magician.
3149605 3152066 He could predict<br />fissures in time.
3152233 3153776 Fissures in time?
3154152 3157196 - Baz, you can't prove that!<br />- Well, not yet.
3157363 3159240 Proving it<br />is what makes it science!
3174505 3175715 Oh, Baz.
3177425 3178968 I never should've<br />given you the thing.
3179218 3181179 It... It belongs in a museum.
3182096 3183806 Give it to me. Please.
3187393 3188770 If I give you this,
3189979 3191439 it must be destroyed.
3192940 3194025 I will.
3196652 3198071 I'll destroy it, Baz.
3200573 3201574 Promise.
3207705 3209207 I'm sorry about this.
3209374 3210583 It's all my fault.
3212794 3214253 - Are you gonna be here?<br />- Yes, sir.
3214337 3216422 Okay. I've gotta catch<br />an airplane.
3216589 3219384 If anyone finds the Grafikos,<br />they'll have both halves.
3219467 3220802 Some things<br />should stay buried.
3220885 3221886 I know, Baz.
3221969 3223179 It's vital<br />that you destroy it.
3223262 3224680 - I will, Baz.<br />- Do you understand?
3224764 3226450 - I'll destroy it. Yes.<br />- Say you will, Indy.
3226474 3227475 I will... Yes.
3227558 3229185 You promised me.<br />Remember that.
3229268 3230311 I will... I promise.
3230395 3231437 There's a reason,
3231521 3234107 a reason that Archimedes<br />broke it in two.
3234273 3235983 I know, Baz.
3236150 3238277 -Indy.
3239028 3240321 Thanks, Wombat.
3240488 3242448 He's gonna be all right<br />in a few days.
3244534 3245952 I'll call you<br />as soon as I land.
3250957 3252375 Ladies and gentlemen,
3252458 3254919 we are 20 minutes<br />from landing in Tangier.
3288703 3290139 - Stop drinking!<br />- What are you doing?
3290163 3291831 No more champagne!<br />How many more...
3291914 3292957 I'm staying.
3293040 3294500 Go home. Go home!
3310016 3311100 Rahim.
3311184 3313519 Miss Shaw, she's here.
3317773 3318941 Forged in bronze.
3319025 3320067 Nearly complete.
3320151 3321861 It is an astrological clock.
3322445 3324655 Dating third century BC
3324822 3328743 and built<br />by Archimedes himself.
3330786 3332205 All right,<br />let's start at 20,000.
3332288 3333456 20,000, thank you very much.
3333623 3334957 30. 30.
3335124 3337793 Gauges green, power full,
3337960 3340296 and when I reach 85, I rotate.
3340880 3341881 What next?
3341964 3343257 Louis, help him! He's so cute.
3343341 3345384 - Pull back on the yoke.<br />- did, man. I'm airborne.
3345468 3346469 Yeah, he's airborne.
3346552 3347905 - Can I have a sip?<br />- Do I pick up the flaps?
3347929 3349931 Don't touch the flaps<br />under 400 feet.
3350097 3351766 Decrease your pitch<br />to get to 120.
3351933 3352934 All right.
3355520 3357772 - Private auction, old timer.<br />- I've gotta get in there.
3357939 3360441 No password, no entry.<br />I don't make the rules.
3363277 3364379 And, uh,<br />what is the current bid?
3364403 3366405 - The bid is 50,000.<br />- Then I bid 55.
3366489 3368032 Who'll give me 60?
3368115 3369659 - 60.<br />- 60. 65?
3369742 3371077 65. 70?
3371160 3372495 - 75.<br />- 75. 80?
3372578 3373579 - 80.<br />- 85.
3373663 3374872 How about 90?
3381629 3383881 - This auction is private.<br />- This auction's over.
3384298 3385633 Au contraire,<br />it's hardly begun.
3385716 3387176 - 100.<br />- 100,000.
3387343 3388886 I like the hat, by the way.
3388970 3390447 Makes you look<br />at least two years younger.
3390471 3391639 Thanks.
3391722 3392783 - 110, bravo.<br />- I told you that
3392807 3394887 - this auction is over.<br />- Excuse me, who is this man?
3394934 3396453 - I'm her godfather.<br />- He's mildly related.
3396477 3398396 And she's up past her bedtime.
3398563 3399915 - Come on, Wombat.<br />- I wouldn't do that.
3399939 3401583 You want to explain it<br />to the cops at the bar?
3401607 3402942 The ones I paid off?
3403484 3405069 You're out of your depth,<br />Jonesy.
3405236 3406713 - "Jonesy"?<br />- He thinks I'm a criminal.
3406737 3408489 He's the one<br />wanted for murder.
3408656 3410700 Nice big picture<br />in the New York Herald. 130?
3410866 3412451 I didn't kill anyone.
3412535 3413595 No entry,<br />it's a private auction.
3413619 3414829 And you know it,<br />Helena.
3415329 3418499 But whoever did<br />was looking for this.
3419166 3421043 What you've got here<br />is Pandora's Box.
3422295 3423504 No, actually.
3424380 3425840 It's my box.
3428467 3429468 You.
3431178 3432305 Have we met?
3432597 3433598 No.
3433681 3435099 My memory<br />is a little fuzzy,
3435182 3436892 but your face rings a bell.
3437476 3438519 Are you still a Nazi?
3442648 3444817 You're confused.<br />My name is Schmidt.
3445401 3447570 Professor Schmidt<br />of Alabama University.
3449280 3451574 Professor Schmidt. How nice<br />to meet you in person.
3451657 3453200 150.
3453284 3454511 After our conversation,<br />Miss Shaw,
3454535 3456535 I thought we'd come to<br />an agreement about the Dial.
3456579 3457580 Funny. The last time
3457663 3459016 I saw the other guy<br />who looks like you,
3459040 3460791 he was also after this.
3461375 3463055 Your numbers were light,<br />Professor Schmidt.
3463085 3465045 But good news is, you're here<br />now. The bid is 160.
3465087 3466922 You don't seem<br />to understand, Miss Shaw.
3467006 3468299 This relic is my property.
3468382 3470885 - It's not yours. You stole it.<br />- Then you stole it.
3471052 3472696 And then I stole it.<br />It's called capitalism.
3472720 3473763 The bid is 160.
3473846 3474847 - 160.<br />- 170?
3474930 3475991 You should've<br />stayed in New York.
3476015 3477075 - 170?<br />- You should've stayed
3477099 3479894 - out of Poland.<br />- 170. Anyone? Anyone?
3480061 3481354 Going, going...
3481729 3482730 Gone!
3483356 3484357 Stay away!
3486108 3487109 Get the Dial.
3491072 3492782 Stay away!
3502083 3503084 Oh, hello, Claude.
3503167 3504647 You should not<br />have come back, Helena.
3513511 3514929 Get back.
3525648 3526649 Teddy!
3541038 3542164 Rahim says you stay.
3553968 3554969 Thank you.
3568065 3569525 See you in the past,<br />Dr. Jones.
3596552 3597553 It's my cab!
3603142 3604310 Tell them to back off.
3604477 3605853 I just told them to shoot you.
3607938 3609148 All right, guys.
3610524 3611901 Put the guns down.
3612067 3613277 Put 'em down.
3615237 3616238 All right.
3617907 3619200 That's better.
3623078 3624705 Oh, dear.
3634757 3635883 Rahim.
3636967 3638469 You're in pajamas.
3638969 3640638 I was sleeping, Helena.
3640721 3641806 - Mm-hmm.<br />- Peacefully.
3641889 3642890 Oh.
3642973 3644809 My father woke me.
3644975 3647603 He told me you'd<br />returned to our hotel.
3649104 3651357 Then he handed me<br />this scimitar
3651524 3654360 and told me to come home<br />with your head.
3655069 3656111 Huh.
3656195 3657488 Does it have to be that bit?
3665246 3668040 I thought maybe you returned<br />because you loved me.
3668207 3669333 Rahim,
3670084 3671669 I had an item to sell.
3671836 3673712 Excuse me. The item<br />she's talking about
3673796 3674856 - actually belongs to me.<br />- No.
3674880 3676233 You do not need to intrude<br />in this conversation.
3676257 3677442 And some very bad people,<br />worse people...
3677466 3678735 You do not need to get<br />involved with my business.
3678759 3680278 - ...have run off with it.<br />- Is this your new man?
3680302 3682012 - No. No, no, no, no.<br />- It's complicated.
3683347 3684849 What exactly<br />do you owe this guy?
3685015 3687101 Just some bail money<br />and a lifetime of happiness.
3687268 3688936 I presume you sold the ring.
3689103 3690872 It didn't go for as much<br />as I thought it would.
3690896 3691939 I'll do it!
3692022 3693107 What are you... Hey!
3699446 3700948 You just got me killed!
3701115 3703701 Well, I'm not the one that's<br />engaged to a mobster!
3703868 3706787 I don't need morality lessons<br />from an aging grave robber!
3706954 3708163 I'm not a grave robber.
3708330 3710332 Your father and I<br />did important work together.
3713002 3714646 Don't tell me<br />all your escapades were noble,
3714670 3716297 selfless quests.<br />You did it for the buzz!
3719008 3720050 Oh, good work, Teddy!
3721552 3723220 - Move over, kid.<br />- Hey!
3733939 3735816 - Helena!<br />- Back up! Back up!
3753709 3754710 Not this way!
3754793 3756521 You don't know where you're<br />going, Indy! Listen to him.
3756545 3758065 - He knows this town!<br />- I know Tangier!
3762384 3763427 There he is!
3768557 3770684 Faster. Go faster!
3770851 3772770 Ten minutes<br />to the airport, boss.
3774772 3776106 I'm not sure<br />Professor Schmidt
3776190 3777550 is an actual professor,<br />by the way.
3777650 3778859 - He's a Nazi!<br />- Turn left!
3778943 3780486 Turn left! Turn left!
3780569 3781737 - Oh, no!<br />- No!
3796418 3798379 Helena! Don't do this!
3806345 3807888 - Hey, this way!<br />- That way!
3808847 3809848 No!
3810808 3812309 Helena!
3814478 3815479 No!
3825072 3826615 What the hell?
3833247 3834498 Helena!
3836458 3838335 Hey! Hey!
3838919 3840504 What the hell?
3843215 3844258 Come on!
3848053 3849888 Come on. Come on!
3883756 3885632 You think<br />he'd be proud of this?
3886550 3887551 Who?
3888886 3890012 Your father!
3890095 3893140 His only daughter selling<br />her soul for bail money!
3893307 3894826 Sounds quite cool<br />when you put it like that.
3894850 3896477 And it's not all bail money.
3896560 3897853 Some of it's gambling debt
3897936 3899080 - and some...<br />- Thank you, Teddy.
3899104 3900898 Helena! No!
3900981 3901982 Helena!
3903692 3905569 How did you end up like this?
3905736 3907071 Well, you mean resourceful?
3907237 3909573 Daring? Beautiful?<br />Self-sufficient?
3919416 3920959 Whoa!
3934890 3936350 Hold on!
3939436 3940437 Go this way!
3949822 3950823 There he is.
3962876 3964044 Stop!
3964128 3965921 - Hey! Hey!<br />- Stop!
3968966 3970259 Aah!
3978642 3979810 On the left!
3980936 3981937 Take the wheel, Teddy!
3984148 3985190 What are you doing?
3985357 3986900 Getting what's mine.
3987860 3988861 Helena!
3993073 3995200 Damn it! You crazy?
3996660 3999163 Hey! Helena!
4003125 4004751 - Take the gun!<br />- Miss Shaw.
4006170 4007838 Let go, Miss Shaw!
4030277 4031695 Let go.
4031778 4034156 Come on! Give me the Dial!
4034907 4036950 Helena!
4038327 4039786 Damn.
4046543 4047729 Turn back! They went that way!
4047753 4048754 He's gone!
4048837 4050672 - Move over!<br />- Hey!
4054092 4057054 I didn't come here to<br />rescue you from your fiancé!
4057137 4058138 Rescue me?
4063310 4064937 I just want the Dial back.
4084373 4085999 Put your hands<br />above your head.
4087125 4088605 Not the smoothest<br />break-up I ever had.
4088669 4089949 If your father<br />was still alive...
4090003 4091046 Well, he's not, Indy.
4091129 4092649 Hey, something's wrong<br />with the engine.
4092714 4093983 If only there'd been<br />someone there for me,
4094007 4095509 some father figure, someone
4095592 4097719 specifically anointed<br />for the job.
4097886 4099206 You have no idea<br />about the kind...
4099263 4100323 Don't beat yourself up<br />about it.
4100347 4102391 I mean,<br />what even is a godfather?
4103392 4105435 Anyway, family never<br />was your strong suit.
4106103 4108438 - What is the time, by the way?<br />- It's...
4108605 4109606 Hey, no fair.
4110315 4111358 Give me that back.
4111441 4112651 That was my father's watch!
4115070 4116071 Give it back to him.
4120534 4122094 You're gonna have<br />to leave town with me.
4122119 4123620 Rahim will be<br />looking for you too.
4123787 4125056 They'll go to<br />Tangier airport first,
4125080 4126140 so we'll need to catch a train
4126164 4127404 and get a plane<br />from Casablanca.
4128208 4130419 Whoa. What was that?
4134298 4135424 Ah.
4135507 4136508 Damn.
4138927 4140012 Yeah.
4140095 4141221 I know, sir.
4143432 4144433 Yes...
4145684 4146685 Copy.
4151773 4153066 They pulled the plug.
4153150 4154526 You got them scared.
4154901 4156101 Because they don't understand.
4156153 4157738 No. Because your associates
4157821 4159156 killed three<br />American civilians
4159323 4161575 and blew up<br />a nationally televised parade.
4161742 4162909 Because you stood up
4162993 4164703 the President<br />of the United States,
4164870 4166038 ran to Morocco,
4166204 4168582 and created an incident that<br />required military extraction!
4170709 4172478 Then take me to DC,<br />and I will explain it all.
4172502 4173920 They want you to vanish.
4174087 4176214 We have half the Dial now.
4176381 4177941 They were just trying<br />to keep you happy,
4178717 4180385 letting you chase that thing.
4180552 4181595 They never cared about it.
4181678 4182763 They will, Miss Mason,
4182846 4184473 when they understand<br />what it can do.
4184639 4185766 You put them<br />on the moon.
4186475 4187726 They got what they wanted.
4189019 4190937 All right, buckle up.<br />We're landing in Spain.
4191563 4193565 C-9 transport will take you<br />from there to Maxwell.
4193732 4195192 I'm not going back to Alabama!
4195359 4197611 All we need is a vessel to<br />take us to the Mediterranean.
4198278 4199756 The Grafikos<br />will take us to the other...
4199780 4201865 Please, Miss Mason. Please.
4202032 4203075 Let go of me, Schmidt.
4203241 4204868 I'm asking you personally.
4205786 4207204 You're a piece of work, Doc.
4208747 4209748 Hey!
4237776 4239277 Schmidt...
4240195 4241822 My name is Voller.
4244616 4245992 Jurgen Voller.
4259256 4261049 That's a Sea Stallion.
4261216 4262634 American helicopter.
4263635 4265345 Did you know<br />the Wright Brothers?
4265804 4267264 - What?<br />- The Wright Brothers.
4267431 4268515 Orville and Wilbur.
4268682 4270934 They invented the airplane,<br />and they lived in Indiana.
4271101 4272644 Wilbur was born in Indiana.
4272811 4275230 I'm not from Indiana, Teddy.
4275313 4277941 And the Wright Brothers were<br />born during the Civil War.
4278108 4280235 Oh, I thought maybe you went<br />to school with them.
4281653 4284114 Oh, come on, Indy.<br />That was funny.
4284281 4285574 - "Funny"?<br />- Mm-hmm.
4286241 4287534 I'm stuck in Tangier
4287617 4289953 with a broken tuk-tuk<br />and two thieves.
4290120 4291329 I'm wanted for murder.
4291413 4293415 Nazis have<br />half of Archimedes' Dial
4293582 4295000 and your father's notebooks.
4296209 4297377 I have a copy.
4298211 4299671 Dad's notebooks.<br />I made a copy.
4299754 4301673 Where?
4301756 4303717 You memorized five notebooks?
4303884 4305093 Seven. And of course not.
4305260 4306887 Half of them were<br />as dull as ditch water.
4307762 4310182 Just the really<br />important bits.
4311057 4312058 Like what?
4312517 4313677 The location of the Grafikos.
4313810 4315520 Nobody knows<br />where the Grafikos is.
4315687 4317022 - Dad did.<br />- No, he didn't.
4317189 4318389 - Yes, he did.<br />- No, he didn't.
4318523 4320150 - Yes, he did.<br />- What's a Grafikos?
4320317 4321752 It's directions<br />to the rest of the Dial.
4321776 4323337 Ask her if she knows<br />what language it's in.
4323361 4325363 Ah! It isn't in a language.<br />It's in a code.
4325530 4326740 What code?
4326907 4328366 Archimedes used two codes.
4328533 4330076 Linear B and Polybius Square.
4330243 4331870 So, even if you find<br />the Grafikos,
4331953 4333580 without me, you can't read it.
4333663 4335415 Please.
4335582 4337417 Dad taught me Polybius<br />when I was nine.
4337584 4339304 Used to leave little notes<br />around the house.
4339336 4340337 "Tidy your room."
4340420 4341713 "Stay away from my brandy."
4342839 4343882 What if it's Linear B?
4344841 4346218 50 quid it's Polybius.
4347260 4348386 Give me that.
4348470 4349471 Hey.
4349888 4351097 That won't work.
4351264 4353545 Moroccan chewing gum's made<br />from the sap of the Manilkara.
4353683 4354976 Heat resistant.
4356478 4357687 Try and start it.
4362609 4363777 - Start it.<br />- I am.
4365320 4367447 Huh? Huh?
4368156 4369741 - Huh?<br />- It won't hold.
4369908 4371826 It'll get us<br />to the train station.
4371993 4373119 "Us"?
4373286 4374496 - You going home?<br />- No.
4374663 4376456 I'm going to Casablanca.
4376623 4378375 Then I'm gonna hop a plane<br />to the Aegean.
4378458 4379459 Just like you.
4379876 4381562 What makes you think<br />we're going to the Aegean?
4381586 4384673 You gotta get to the Grafikos<br />before the Nazis.
4384839 4386925 Archimedes was<br />surrounded by Romans.
4387634 4388843 Where else would it be?
4389010 4390011 The Aegean is huge, Indy.
4390178 4391378 And you don't<br />have coordinates.
4391471 4393014 And you don't have a boat.
4395934 4398353 I've got an old friend<br />in Greece.
4398520 4399896 An expert diver.
4400063 4401898 With a big, beautiful boat
4402065 4404109 that'll get us there<br />before they will.
4404985 4407028 You need me,
4407195 4408405 and you know it.
4458538 4459789 Renny!
4461875 4462917 Indy?
4463752 4464794 Indy!
4470258 4472218 So, that's the expert diver?
4472385 4474596 Spain's greatest frogman.
4476765 4478391 Hey!
4478558 4480644 So, Spain's greatest frogman<br />has a shit boat
4480727 4482020 and only one good frog leg?
4482187 4483229 Stop it.
4487025 4488234 You got<br />a different boat.
4488318 4489527 Stop it.
4503792 4504834 We're going here.
4506461 4508922 Where they found the first<br />part of the Antikythera.
4509839 4511007 But...
4512342 4513635 We're going deeper.
4515220 4517222 Dad tracked down<br />the old sponge diver
4517305 4518932 who found the Dial.
4519099 4520266 He told him
4520433 4523395 that the wrecked Roman ship<br />broke up under the sea
4523561 4524688 70 feet below.
4524854 4527816 Filled with the skeletons<br />of over 100 centurions.
4528983 4530151 That's where they found it.
4530902 4534823 But he said that most<br />of the ship had broken off
4534989 4536741 and sunk to the ocean floor.
4537701 4539285 Too deep for sponge divers.
4540328 4543164 So, Dad started wondering<br />why a Roman warship
4543331 4546710 would sail out of Syracuse<br />with 100 centurions on board.
4550422 4553800 They weren't taking<br />half a Dial for a joyride.
4557637 4559222 They had the Grafikos...
4562100 4564269 and they were looking<br />for the rest of the Dial.
4567564 4569190 Your dad was a genius.
4569816 4570859 Yeah.
4572277 4573319 He was.
4593173 4594174 Seven of spades.
4597469 4598553 How do you do that?
4598720 4600138 Wow.
4600221 4601431 Do it again.
4605435 4607312 Pick a card, Dr. Jones.
4614819 4615945 Seven of spades!
4618072 4619115 She's magic.
4619282 4620450 Trick deck.
4620617 4621618 No.
4622786 4624204 I force the card.
4624370 4625663 I offer the mark,
4625830 4626998 you,
4627165 4628166 the feeling of a choice,
4628333 4630543 but ultimately, I make you<br />pick the card I want.
4632670 4633838 "The mark."
4636883 4638802 Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day.
4638885 4640720 I have to check the lines.
4646768 4647852 Good night.
4650980 4654108 You remember seeing any dates<br />in your father's notebooks?
4655443 4656820 Dates?
4656903 4658279 What dates?
4659197 4660198 These dates.
4663910 4666371 Written over and over again<br />in this letter.
4667789 4669624 August 20th, 1969.
4669791 4671334 That's three days from now.
4671501 4673753 And the same date in 1939.
4673920 4676339 Two weeks before<br />Hitler invades Poland.
4678174 4679759 Wait.
4680552 4682887 Now you believe the Dial<br />has magical powers?
4684180 4686224 I don't believe in magic,<br />Wombat.
4688101 4690478 But a few times in my life,<br />I've seen things.
4693606 4695358 Things I can't explain.
4696693 4699070 And I've come to believe<br />it's not so much
4699237 4701364 what you believe.
4701531 4703783 It's how hard you believe it.
4706911 4708246 I've seen things too, Indy.
4709163 4711708 The only thing<br />worth believing in, ever,
4711875 4713543 is cash.
4715837 4716921 Right.
4722719 4724039 What if you could<br />go back in time?
4726180 4727223 What would you do?
4728600 4730018 Witness the Trojan War?
4731311 4732645 Check in on Cleopatra?
4736274 4738401 I'd stop my son<br />from enlisting.
4741571 4743281 Did he sign up to please you?
4744365 4746576 No, he signed up<br />to piss me off.
4750246 4751748 How would you<br />have stopped him?
4756628 4758463 I'd tell him<br />he was gonna die.
4765511 4767388 I'd tell him<br />that his mother would...
4770016 4771851 find no end to her grief.
4773686 4775438 And that his father<br />would be...
4778274 4780193 helpless to console her.
4783488 4785990 And that the loss would put<br />an end to their marriage.
4800004 4801214 You're still wearing the ring.
4820984 4822235 Mm.
4823903 4825321 Promising.
4834038 4835456 More promising.
4841254 4842338 Hello.
4844549 4846551 Get your gear on.<br />They're waiting.
4851180 4852265 Hey.
4853266 4854267 Come here.
4855101 4856477 Okay.
4856561 4857621 I'm gonna show you something.
4857645 4860648 Gosh, this looks important.
4862817 4863818 Around the rope...
4863901 4866029 Now, we are going deep.
4866195 4869032 Descend fast, and breathe<br />through these hoses.
4869198 4870241 Okay?
4870324 4872035 Ah, stay separate.
4872201 4874162 No crisscross. All right?
4874328 4875496 We cannot stay long.
4875663 4879000 I have a method that<br />usually prevents the bends.
4880001 4881127 - Usually?<br />- Yeah.
4881210 4882420 I call it "the bounce."
4882587 4883588 You know, fast down,
4883755 4885673 three minutes on the bottom,<br />and then up.
4885840 4886883 Three minutes!
4887050 4888885 No one more second.
4889552 4891804 - Three minutes.<br />- Yeah, that's right.
4891971 4893811 - Where is my lighter?<br />- I don't know, capitán.
4894182 4895975 We have to go.
4898311 4899771 Uh, quick question.
4899937 4901272 What's that?
4901439 4902815 - They're sharks?<br />- No.
4902899 4905276 No, no. No sharks here. Eels.
4906360 4908654 - Eels?<br />- Anguilas.
4908738 4909739 Most are small.
4909906 4911491 Sometimes they are big.<br />Two meters.
4911657 4913701 But if you see them,<br />stay still.
4913868 4917080 They bite you,<br />they lock the jaw. Yeah.
4917246 4918664 They look like snakes.
4919373 4920374 No, they don't.
4920458 4922627 Private Brandy<br />reporting for duty.
4923127 4924128 You're not coming, Teddy?
4924879 4926005 I can't swim.
4926172 4927298 Lucky him.
4927465 4928758 Everyone can swim.
4930635 4932512 Reach and pull.<br />Reach and pull.
4934555 4935640 All right.<br />You stay here
4935723 4937016 with Hector<br />and watch our lines.
4940019 4941938 It is time, camarada.
5050296 5051297 Two minutes?
5184555 5185556 Hey.
5217421 5218422 Hurry up!
5233479 5234980 Helena!
5243739 5244740 Come on.
5244907 5246450 That's it. That's it.<br />That's it.
5247284 5248494 That's it.
5271851 5273018 Who are these people?
5275271 5276272 Nazis.
5276355 5278816 First, you return my Dial,<br />Dr. Jones,
5278983 5282111 and now,<br />you bring me the Grafikos.
5283028 5285197 I'm very happy you're not<br />wasting in retirement.
5285573 5287950 I should have retired you<br />when I had the chance.
5288117 5289243 Where are your sponsors?
5289410 5290995 I'm on my own now.
5291162 5292830 Things move forward,<br />Dr. Jones.
5292913 5293914 And sometimes...
5295791 5297585 they go backward.
5300838 5303090 Now, let's get comfortable<br />and have a little talk.
5330159 5331535 What language is that?
5331702 5333287 It's not a language.
5334538 5335623 It's a code.
5336457 5337458 Polybius.
5338292 5339585 You owe me 50 quid.
5341921 5343714 Not familiar<br />with Polybius cipher?
5343881 5344882 No.
5345633 5347051 But it appears you are.
5351430 5352640 Read it, please.
5360773 5361774 No.
5367530 5368531 Indy...
5379625 5380918 Feeling helpful now?
5384171 5385172 I am.
5388342 5389593 I know this stuff backwards.
5389760 5390844 No!
5392429 5393430 Sorry, Indy.
5393847 5395224 I don't do noble death.
5395891 5396976 Just
5397142 5398561 cold, hard maths.
5399103 5400943 I crack the code,<br />help you find the other half.
5402356 5403983 One hundred grand. Cash.
5404066 5405150 Helena...
5405818 5406819 Take it or leave it.
5408320 5409363 You have a deal.
5422960 5424670 He'll never pay you.
5426213 5427573 I think<br />you will find this is worth
5427631 5429091 more than your asking price.
5438601 5440102 - Teddy.<br />- Helena,
5440269 5441437 don't do this.
5446859 5448277 Let's see what we've got here.
5450446 5451822 "My Makhana..."
5452323 5453324 that's "machine"...
5454575 5458120 "lies with me,<br />in the city I left.
5458287 5460664 "Where wolves<br />teach men to walk.
5460831 5464960 "Under one of nine, I lie."
5467796 5469506 Only one thing<br />lies anywhere forever.
5469673 5472384 The dead. So, if the Dial lies<br />with him, then...
5474261 5475763 then this is directions<br />to his tomb.
5476263 5477598 The Tomb of Archimedes?
5479016 5480809 Undiscovered<br />for two millennia.
5483896 5485981 "The city I left."
5486607 5488651 Archimedes lived two places<br />his entire life,
5488734 5490069 so he only left one.
5490944 5492946 Anyone? At the back?
5493822 5495366 Come on, Indy.<br />Everyone knows this.
5495532 5497368 - Even this clown.<br />- Alexandria.
5498035 5499870 Full marks.
5500329 5502498 Now, "wolf"<br />in Greek is "lycos."
5502581 5504917 Root of the word<br />"lycaeum" or "school."
5505084 5507711 And the Doric<br />for "walking" is...
5508962 5509963 "peripatio."
5511256 5514009 Which also happens to be<br />the word for...
5515344 5516595 Aw.
5519264 5521225 I thought you were<br />a bright spark.
5523811 5526939 "Peripatio" means "walking,"
5527106 5529525 but it also means "counting."
5529692 5532820 So, "Where wolves<br />teach men to walk"
5533570 5535864 - could be...<br />- The School of Mathematics.
5537199 5538784 Is correct.
5538951 5540494 Now, the next bit is easy.
5541787 5543372 "Beneath one of nine"?
5544540 5545874 There are nine Muses.
5546041 5547167 The Museon.
5547334 5549795 The Greek word for the<br />Great Library of Alexandria.
5549878 5551004 Which, as we all know,
5551088 5553757 has nine statues<br />supporting its roof.
5553924 5554925 May I?
5556093 5557219 Thank you.
5558387 5561140 The nine Muses,<br />in reverse order,
5562599 5564101 are Calliope,
5564852 5565853 Urania,
5567438 5568480 Polymnia,
5569440 5570983 - Erato...<br />- Polymnia.
5571191 5573569 ...and Meli whasisname,
5573944 5574945 that other one,
5575696 5576697 Thalia,
5577448 5578657 Euteroe,
5578824 5580909 but the first is...
5581160 5582161 Clio.
5583996 5585164 The Muse of history and time.
5585330 5586540 That Archimedes,
5586707 5588017 - what a clever bugger.<br />- The entrance
5588041 5590169 to the tomb is by<br />the School of Mathematics,
5590335 5592045 under a statue of Clio,
5592212 5594965 in the ruins of the Great<br />Library of Alexandria.
5595132 5596425 Gold star for Dr. Brains.
5597801 5598802 Teddy!
5608729 5610314 The Grafikos, get it!
5637966 5640677 I have said it before,<br />and I will say it again!
5640844 5643472 When you're<br />in a tight spot, dynamite.
5645224 5646767 My friend was just murdered.
5652272 5653273 Sorry.
5653440 5655192 You told them everything.
5656902 5657986 Word for word.
5658612 5660531 But Archimedes<br />didn't make it that easy.
5661323 5663242 The tomb isn't in Alexandria.
5672292 5673293 Go!
5676755 5677756 So, what do you see?
5678423 5680217 Polybius square.
5680759 5681885 Made of?
5684429 5685639 Wax and wood.
5687266 5688517 Anything else?
5691979 5692980 It's heavy.
5696024 5697150 Too heavy.
5699278 5700404 Give me that.
5740611 5742321 This is solid gold?
5742487 5743697 Ancient gold.
5745198 5746199 From the Nile.
5747868 5748869 Hold it, Teddy.
5760380 5761465 Sell this thing
5761632 5763300 and we are out of the hole<br />and then some.
5763383 5764384 I have just the customer.
5764551 5765928 Cranky, old Duchess<br />in Gibraltar...
5766011 5767971 This is going in a museum.
5770849 5772142 Take the wheel, Teddy.
5779024 5780025 What does it say?
5782152 5785030 "Search where Dionysius
5785822 5788575 "hears each whisper
5789409 5791453 "like a hurricane."
5794289 5795707 The Ear.
5796416 5798210 The cave of Dionysius.
5799044 5800045 Where is that?
5801505 5802547 In Sicily.
5804049 5806134 - How much fuel have we got?<br />- It's full.
5815143 5816144 They're heading west.
5817521 5818522 Not east.
5847467 5849594 - I want the papaya.<br />- How much is it?
5853056 5854057 Take this.
5856810 5858979 Look at that kid<br />with the straw hat.
5859271 5861064 This way.
5864651 5865652 Hey.
5866695 5869156 What do you think?
5874953 5876204 What are we doing?
5877831 5879499 Waiting for closing time<br />at the caves.
5879666 5881168 It's crawling with tourists.
5881334 5883754 Okay, so he's, like,<br />running the show now?
5885130 5886548 He's not running<br />the show, Teddy.
5887924 5891053 I just thought we were in this<br />for all the wrong reasons.
5891636 5892804 We are.
5896266 5897267 Most assuredly.
5897350 5900103 You know he's never gonna<br />let us sell any of that stuff.
5901646 5903273 I'm still in charge, Teddy.
5903356 5904399 Helena,<br />get over here!
5904483 5905484 Give me a hand!
5911406 5912532 Oh, you splurged.
5913867 5914910 Here's your backpack.
5914993 5916036 Where's the kid?
5929966 5931551 Hey, watch it!
5931635 5932886 What's wrong<br />with you?
5961414 5962582 Hello.
5964000 5965001 Hey.
5967754 5969005 Let me go!
5970298 5971341 Let me go!
5979141 5981893 Get off me! Let me go!
5985021 5986231 Hey, hey, hey!
5997075 5998160 Helena!
5999536 6000954 They've got Teddy.
6003081 6004666 They took him<br />up the hill somewhere.
6013550 6015552 Hey. Hey! Hey!
6024769 6025929 What are they<br />gonna do to him?
6026021 6028690 He knows about the Ear,<br />what the Grafikos says.
6030066 6031526 They're not gonna hurt him.
6031693 6032861 They're gonna use him
6033612 6035864 to get the other half<br />of the Dial.
6035947 6036990 We gotta get there first.
6050170 6054216 Colonizing queens<br />built many cities in Sicily.
6054382 6055884 - The temple...<br />- Let's go.
6056551 6059095 ...is the oldest<br />of the Greek temples.
6060180 6061556 The cave's over there.
6071942 6073693 Could we go<br />a little faster, please?
6082911 6084371 The Ear of Dionysius.
6092087 6093088 Wow.
6107310 6109020 "Search where Dionysius hears
6109104 6110814 "each whisper<br />like a hurricane."
6112023 6113024 That's some echo.
6114776 6117362 Keep making noise till we<br />find out where it's loudest.
6134796 6135964 Stop.
6143555 6144681 This is it.
6149644 6151146 Greek pediment.
6151813 6152814 An entrance.
6154232 6155233 Used to be.
6158528 6159529 A crescent.
6162407 6163491 Just like on the Grafikos.
6171082 6172917 I think there's<br />an opening up there.
6179549 6180550 You okay up there?
6181718 6182886 Yes.
6185388 6186431 You're not moving.
6188933 6190143 I'm thinking.
6192979 6193980 About?
6195148 6198068 About what the hell I'm doing<br />up here, 40 feet in the air,
6198401 6199986 with crap shoulders,
6200153 6201946 crumbling vertebrae,
6202113 6204616 a plate in one leg,<br />screws in the other.
6204783 6206034 Yeah, I get it. I get it.
6206659 6207786 No, you don't get it.
6208620 6209829 You're half my age.
6210872 6213541 You haven't been forced<br />to drink the blood of Kali.
6213708 6214959 No. Fair enough.
6215794 6217545 Or been tortured with voodoo.
6218922 6219923 And I'm just guessing,
6220006 6221806 but I don't think<br />you've been shot nine times,
6221841 6224302 including once by your father.
6226054 6227389 Dad shot you?
6228098 6229265 Don't talk to me.
6229432 6230632 Just go ahead.<br />I'll follow you.
6239359 6241945 No, no, no. We are close.<br />We are close.
6242112 6243113 Look around you.
6243279 6244839 - We are close.<br />- The Cave of Dionysius.
6244948 6247826 No, no, no. The cave<br />is closed for renovation.
6248827 6249828 Oh.
6249911 6250954 Let me ask again.
6251037 6252956 Where is<br />the Cave of Dionysius?
6272600 6274769 What's the matter?<br />You worried about the kid?
6276062 6277730 Are you sure<br />they won't hurt him?
6277897 6279107 He'll be fine.
6279274 6280316 He's smart.
6282193 6283570 Where'd you find him?
6284362 6287407 He, uh... He tried to steal<br />my purse outside a casino
6287490 6289951 in Marrakesh when he was 10.
6290118 6291953 I hit him repeatedly<br />with my car door,
6292120 6294622 but he didn't let go<br />and neither did I.
6294789 6296332 So, been together ever since.
6297459 6299419 Thought you were<br />all about the money.
6300545 6301546 I am.
6304632 6306468 Nobody memorizes every page
6306551 6308678 of their<br />dead father's notebooks
6308845 6309929 for the money.
6316561 6318021 Herr Voller!
6328198 6329574 They went that way.
6339918 6341669 Why?
6344881 6346716 Come on, come on.
6348593 6350386 Let's go.
6355099 6356100 Oh, my...
6359145 6360647 Oh, my God!
6361481 6362815 Oh, my God!
6363024 6364400 - Oh, God!<br />- No, no.
6365318 6366694 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
6371241 6372867 Are they off me? Get 'em off!
6372951 6374619 - No, no. Wait.<br />- Get 'em off!
6387674 6388758 What is that?
6391719 6393221 Methane.
6394264 6395473 Don't breathe.
6395640 6396641 Don't breathe?
6400353 6401729 We've gotta get outta here.
6410572 6411573 Athena.
6413324 6414617 Goddess of war.
6417495 6418705 And reason.
6423001 6424377 "Under the moon...
6426671 6428673 "life lies at her feet."
6436431 6437765 Water displacement.
6438558 6439892 Get in the pool!
6440059 6442061 Why?<br />Help me open the door.
6442228 6443855 Well, they didn't<br />get out the doors!
6443938 6444939 Get in the pool!
6445982 6447859 Okay, I'm getting in the pool.
6448026 6449152 Help me.
6451571 6453906 Archimedes was fascinated
6455408 6457368 by water displacement!
6471215 6472216 Whoa!
6498368 6500662 Hey! Get back here! Klaber!
6514884 6516052 You don't need to do that.
6542120 6543162 Hey!
6544539 6546290 Give me that!
6547083 6548793 No!
6555341 6556634 Leave them.
6557343 6558970 I said leave them.
6583411 6584954 Reach and pull.
6585121 6586706 Reach and pull.
6586873 6589041 Reach and pull.
6617487 6619030 Archimedes' tomb.
6647975 6649268 Grab that corner.
6695606 6696607 Indy.
6698901 6700278 This frieze...
6702947 6704198 It's a phoenix.
6704365 6705366 A common icon.
6705533 6707118 No. Look,<br />it isn't.
6708703 6710413 This phoenix has propellers.
6719297 6720756 What's this doing here?
6729557 6732560 Clocks won't be invented<br />for 1,000 years,
6733227 6734687 much less watches.
6737231 6738441 Archimedes used it.
6741986 6743362 Dad was right.
6744030 6745031 It works.
6745114 6746741 Of course it works,<br />Miss Shaw.
6749452 6750703 Mathematics works.
6751829 6754832 As it conquered space,<br />it will conquer time.
6762715 6764634 You've already<br />lost your son, Dr. Jones.
6764800 6765801 Your wife is gone.
6765885 6767803 Do you really<br />want to lose your godchild?
6770890 6771974 For what?
6772391 6774560 A world that no longer cares<br />about men like us.
6785905 6786906 Thank you.
6825611 6826988 History's greatest moment.
6834078 6835371 Its end.
6843045 6844046 Throw me the gun!
6854432 6856684 - Get him outta here.<br />- Teddy.
6857727 6858853 Teddy! Teddy!
6859020 6860062 Come on! Go!
6860146 6861147 This way. Come on.
6865234 6866777 Go!
6870364 6871365 Indy!
6873367 6874535 Go!
6874702 6875953 Go!
6876120 6877204 Stop!
6880583 6882001 Now what?
6883627 6884628 Bring him.
6892720 6893721 Helena, come on!
6893888 6895181 Teddy, we can't<br />just leave him.
6895264 6896599 We're not! Follow me!
6898559 6899560 Come on!
6903481 6904565 Come on.
6918746 6920706 Teddy. Come on.<br />We've got a car.
6925169 6926587 Ah, crap.
6932802 6933844 Stay there.
6952738 6953739 Hop on.
6957368 6960287 The first hemisphere<br />sets the destination.
6961789 6965376 The second calculates<br />the location of the fissure
6966627 6968462 in Alexandrine coordinates.
6969046 6971924 Have Messner transpose this<br />to longitude and latitude,
6972967 6974844 and transmit way points<br />to the pilots.
6986981 6988482 Shortcut.
6992778 6995739 You got coordinates for 37.07.
6995823 6997158 So, who is it?
6997908 6999160 Churchill?
7000494 7001495 Ike?
7003831 7006333 Who are you gonna kill<br />to win the war?
7007168 7010045 In a few minutes,<br />with the help of Archimedes,
7010212 7012089 we shall fly<br />into the eye of this storm
7012882 7015134 and cross into<br />Sicilian airspace
7015301 7018804 on August 20th, 1939.
7019555 7021390 We will head north<br />over friendly skies
7021473 7023100 with enough fuel<br />to reach Munich.
7024393 7026020 My quarry<br />will be waiting for me
7026562 7029023 at 16 Prinzregentenplatz
7029398 7031609 for an update<br />on his V-1 rocket.
7038616 7042578 What kind of Nazi<br />kills the Führer?
7044205 7046874 The kind that believes<br />in victory, Dr. Jones.
7052129 7055966 Hitler lit a fire that could<br />have burned 1,000 years.
7056133 7057635 I saw every mistake.
7058427 7059720 Every blunder.
7059887 7061555 And I will correct them all.
7061722 7064350 History is a long list<br />of losses, Dr. Jones.
7065392 7066644 It's just a question of whose.
7079323 7080616 Stop!
7153314 7154315 Teddy.
7156150 7157510 You think you can fly<br />one of those?
7159153 7160154 A Nord?
7162865 7163866 Sure.
7164616 7165743 It's not a ringing response.
7165909 7167536 Well, I haven't flown a Nord.
7167703 7169246 You've never flown any plane.
7170456 7172249 I'll get it started.
7172416 7173667 No, Teddy.
7174835 7175836 Crap.
7203238 7204823 Fasten<br />your seat belt, Dr. Jones.
7204990 7206283 There might be<br />some turbulence.
7207534 7209745 You're German, Voller.
7209912 7211914 Don't try and be funny.
7235312 7237147 Come on, big talker.
7251578 7252955 Okay.
7269805 7271390 Okay. Okay.
7271557 7274101 Gauges green. Power full.
7274768 7277271 And when I reach 85, I rotate.
7315017 7316435 Okay, wings down.
7318520 7320522 Okay, 84 miles an hour.
7320981 7322065 Rotate.
7389841 7391176 Time to destination?
7392386 7393929 60 seconds.
7399268 7400727 Continental drift.
7404147 7405357 Continental drift!
7407109 7409695 Archimedes didn't know<br />about continental drift.
7410529 7412698 He couldn't have!
7412781 7414700 It hadn't been observed yet.
7415701 7417494 You're off target.
7417953 7419830 Your coordinates<br />are based on markers
7420581 7423792 that have been moving<br />for 2,000 years!
7423959 7426795 You could be off<br />by 10 degrees, by...
7442352 7443937 30 seconds.
7445105 7446106 Herr Voller...
7446189 7448233 Your calculations are wrong!
7449484 7451236 - Herr Voller...<br />- Will you shut up?
7451320 7452321 I'm thinking!
7455282 7456282 20 seconds.
7458994 7460078 Hold the flight path!
7462080 7463373 15 seconds.
7466918 7468962 I don't know<br />where we're going, Jürgen.
7469046 7470047 10 seconds.
7470172 7471172 9!
7471214 7472758 But it sure as hell
7473175 7474635 - 7!<br />- ...ain't 1939!
7474801 7475427 6!
7475594 7476594 Turn around!
7477721 7478721 Abort!
7478930 7479930 Turn around!
7480641 7481641 ABORT!!!
7481767 7483727 We're being pulled in!
7493737 7495072 What are you doing?!
7495280 7496280 This is my plane!
7496448 7497783 You're flying my plane!
7522599 7523767 We're going to DIE!!!
7525102 7526812 We need to pull up!
7548667 7549835 Restart engines!
7578530 7579698 That's Sicily.
7579781 7580991 1939.
7582743 7584161 I did it.
7584327 7585829 I did it, Dr. Jones!
7585996 7587706 Setting coordinates for Munich.
7594671 7596715 Yesterday<br />belongs to us, Dr. Jones.
7621615 7623784 Those are Roman triremes.
7652020 7653230 Keep it in the air!
7673500 7674084 Master...
7674334 7676753 The Romans are getting closer.
7678505 7679505 They have dragons!
7684553 7685929 Amazing.
7692602 7693603 Whoa!
7694896 7695897 Open the door!
7700861 7701862 What are you doing?
7702821 7704531 What are you doing,<br />you idiots?
7704698 7706491 They think we're a monster!
7707033 7708034 Aah!
7712956 7714457 You have<br />to turn around.
7714624 7716543 This is the Siege of Syracuse.
7717669 7719004 214 BC.
7719170 7720380 You got the wrong war.
7724134 7725134 Master...
7728388 7729639 Don't ride out there, Master!
7730223 7731433 The dragons!!
7741693 7745196 We must take down their dragons!
7752203 7753288 Boss!
7753371 7754371 Change course!
7754456 7755832 The portal closes in minutes!
7756249 7757249 I have to go back!
7757626 7758752 I can't be here!
7758960 7760045 I CAN'T STAY HERE!
7760211 7761671 The plane won't make it!!
7791368 7792369 Get out of the way!
7798708 7800835 How do you like that,<br />you savages?
7803880 7806633 Sorry, pal, but you're a Nazi!
7816685 7818770 What are you doing here?
7818937 7820480 Rescuing you!
7831116 7832909 Get him off!
7834285 7835370 Indy!
7841001 7842210 Parachute!
7845005 7846172 I got a parachute!
7847674 7849092 Hang on!
7852095 7853179 Let go!
7855515 7856891 Give me the parachute!
7862981 7865108 Grab it. Hang on!
7866651 7868403 Indy!
7895764 7897223 We're losing altitude!
7898475 7899475 We're going down!
7901311 7902896 I've lost control!
7921122 7923583 Hey,<br />those are my friends.
7923750 7925794 Those are my friends.<br />We need to help them!
7926961 7928546 Those are my friends!
7990441 7991818 Eureka.
8009002 8010003 He's trying to land.
8010086 8012046 Come on, Indy. Help me.
8012797 8014841 Get up. Yeah.
8015008 8017302 We need to get you<br />out of here. Okay.
8019220 8020513 Help me. Sit up, okay?
8021389 8022640 Sit up. You need to help me.
8022807 8024684 I know it hurts,<br />but we gotta get you back.
8024851 8027562 This is incredible, Wombat.
8028104 8030064 Incredible.
8031608 8033318 Yeah, it very well is.
8033484 8035069 But we have to<br />get you out of here.
8037197 8038323 My God.
8039991 8041868 We're witnessing history.
8048958 8050752 Reverse these numbers.
8050919 8052003 They'll get you home.
8053671 8054672 What?
8057592 8058801 I'm going to stay.
8059552 8061554 No. You're not serious.
8064390 8065433 Wow, you are serious.
8069520 8071147 Indy, you've been shot.
8071231 8072232 You're bleeding.
8072607 8074150 You can't stay here.
8074234 8075235 Yes, I can.
8075902 8076945 But for what? For...
8077028 8080573 For a long, painful death<br />with poultice and leeches?
8081616 8083743 I've imagined this, Wombat.
8084827 8086663 Studied it.
8086829 8088873 - All my life.<br />- Yeah.
8089040 8092043 And if you stay here,<br />you will muck it all up.
8092126 8093127 And die.
8093878 8095505 Please, get up.
8097257 8098424 Helena!
8098758 8099759 I did it!
8099926 8102262 Bravo, Teddy! Three cheers!
8102428 8104055 Okay. Indy, we've gotta go.<br />Get up.
8104138 8105658 I need to get you<br />into that plane, okay?
8105682 8106683 - We need to.<br />- No. No.
8106849 8109185 Get up. You can... We can!
8121656 8122656 Master!
8125159 8126953 We have to leave, Master.
8128579 8129580 It's him.
8138548 8140591 He's asking<br />how far we've come.
8144012 8146764 Two thousand years.
8147390 8148558 We've come...
8149142 8152145 two thousand years.
8154480 8157608 But we didn't expect to meet...
8158151 8160653 the great...
8161195 8163239 Archimedes.
8168911 8169911 You...
8171039 8172373 were always...
8173041 8174292 going to...
8174876 8176461 meet me.
8177211 8179047 That dial<br />is a forced deck.
8179130 8180590 It doesn't take us<br />anywhere but here.
8180757 8182050 He built it to get help.
8182216 8184761 Well, we just scared off<br />the entire Roman Navy,
8184844 8186030 so I think<br />we've helped enough.
8186054 8187680 Apologies, Archimedes.
8187889 8189223 I'm a fan...
8189474 8192185 - but we need to leave. He's hurt.<br />- Helena...
8192810 8193871 He can't<br />keep that, by the way.
8193895 8194955 He needs to build his own one.
8194979 8196647 Helena, we need to go!
8197106 8199233 Indy, the window is closing!
8199400 8200526 We cannot get stuck here!
8202028 8202653 I want...
8202862 8203946 to stay...
8204322 8206074 with you.
8206240 8208201 No, no, no!<br />Do not say yes!
8208785 8211037 You are a brilliant man...
8211287 8213289 a wise man...
8213831 8215083 a genius...
8215166 8216167 Helena...
8216334 8218669 a hero to your people.
8219379 8222924 But he can't help you.
8224092 8225259 This is your time.
8225343 8226677 This is your time.
8226761 8228721 He must be in his own time -
8228805 8230056 He needs to be in his.
8230139 8232433 His work is not done.<br />He needs to go home.
8232517 8234185 There is medicine at home.
8234268 8236145 He cannot die here. He can't.
8237814 8240650 Helena, get on the plane.
8243236 8244320 I'll be all right.
8246155 8247490 No, you won't.
8250451 8252203 I need to do this.
8253287 8254288 Me too.
8308801 8309802 Good morning.
8314682 8316058 How's the shoulder?
8318728 8321230 Better than my jaw.
8324859 8325860 Right.
8327862 8329363 You should've<br />let me stay.
8330239 8331449 I couldn't do that.
8340458 8341459 Why not?
8343336 8345880 Well, for starters, you'd have<br />changed the course of history.
8350218 8352011 That's supposed to be<br />a bad thing?
8356140 8357934 You're meant to be here, Indy.
8361729 8362730 Here.
8367860 8368986 For who?
8396305 8397890 Marion.
8399141 8400184 Hey.
8419453 8420454 Teddy.
8422081 8423082 Marion.
8425793 8426794 What are you doing?
8428337 8429505 Putting groceries away.
8431799 8434510 There wasn't a scrap of food<br />in this place.
8435428 8437430 No. Really.
8442226 8444437 Someone told me you were back.
8451902 8453529 Are you back, Indy?
8455156 8456866 It was explosives,
8457033 8459160 and Indy was running,<br />Marion was running,
8459327 8461996 and suddenly<br />the plane exploded.
8465708 8467752 Indy, you're up and about.
8468961 8470338 Yes, I am.
8471464 8472465 Yes.
8473090 8475134 Why don't we go<br />and get some ice cream, Kids?
8475301 8476636 But Marion<br />just bought some.
8476719 8477803 Oh,<br />I know a better place.
8477970 8480181 You can never have too much<br />ice cream, can you?
8483893 8484894 See you later.
8488481 8491400 A British<br />tar is a soaring soul
8491567 8494403 As free as a mountain bird
8494570 8496405 His energetic fist
8496572 8498991 Should be ready to resist...
8500868 8502161 That looks bad.
8503663 8504914 Does it hurt?
8507458 8508918 Everything hurts.
8511796 8513422 I know how that feels.
8519512 8522139 Well, where doesn't it hurt?
8530731 8531732 Here.
8532525 8533776 It doesn't hurt here.
8542034 8543577 And here.
8567184 8569562 Jabari, Alia,<br />slow down!
8569729 8571856 Helena! Hurry up!
8572022 8574692 I scream, you scream...
8574859 8576986 Everybody, slow down.
8577153 8579155 - I scream, you scream<br />-KIDS: I scream, I scream
8579321 8581031 We all scream for ice cream!
8581198 8583284 Slow down.
