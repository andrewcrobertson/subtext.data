2095301 2097803 There were irregularities<br />in their rotations.

4325529 4326738 What code?
4326905 4328364 Archimedes used two codes.

4519097 4520264 He told him

4534988 4536739 and sunk to the ocean floor.
4537699 4539283 Too deep for sponge divers.
4540326 4543162 So, Dad started wondering<br />why a Roman warship

5450444 5451820 "My Makhana..."”
5452321 5453322 that's "machine"...
5454573 5458118 "lies with me,<br />in the city I left.
5458285 5460662 "Where wolves<br />teach men to walk.
5460829 5464958 "Under one of nine, I lie."
5467795 5469505 Only one thing<br />lies anywhere forever.
5469672 5472383 The dead. So, if the Dial lies<br />with him, then...
5474259 5475760 then this is directions<br />to his tomb.
5476261 5477595 The Tomb of Archimedes?
5479014 5480807 Undiscovered<br />for two millennia.
5483894 5485979 "The city I left."
5486605 5488648 Archimedes lived two places<br />his entire life,
5488732 5490066 so he only left one.
5490943 5492945 Anyone? At the back?
5493821 5495364 Come on, Indy.<br />Everyone knows this.

5500327 5502495 Now, "wolf"<br />in Greek is “lycos.”
5502579 5504914 Root of the word<br />"lycaeum” or "school."
5505082 5507709 And the Doric<br />for "walking" is...
5508961 5509962 "peripatio.”
5511255 5514007 Which also happens to be<br />the word for...
5515342 5516593 Aw.
5519263 5521223 I thought you were<br />a bright spark.
5523809 5526937 "Peripatio” means "walking,"
5527104 5529523 but it also means "counting.”
5529690 5532818 So, "Where wolves<br />teach men to walk"
5533569 5535862 -could be...<br />-The School of Mathematics.
5537197 5538781 Is correct.
5538949 5540492 Now, the next bit is easy.
5541785 5543369 "Beneath one of nine"?
5544538 5545872 There are nine Muses.
5546040 5547166 The Museon.
5547332 5549792 The Greek word for the<br />Great Library of Alexandria.
5549877 5551003 Which, as we all know,
