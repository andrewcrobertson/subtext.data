45839 46923 On your feet!
68027 69237 An American, Colonel.
69529 71531 He was at the gate,<br />impersonating an officer.
78079 79205 You were alone?
80832 83752 Spy, you were alone?
83835 85336 I like to be alone.
86713 88381 What did you come here for?
89257 91718 You got a lot of nice stuff.
91885 93178 Other people's stuff.
94929 97015 To the victor<br />belongs the spoils.
98266 99434 To the victor?
100435 101895 Berlin's in rubble.
101978 103730 The Führer's in hiding.
104939 106649 You lost.
110570 112030 Take him upstairs.
112614 114574 What? What? Hey!
114741 115825 Hey, wait a second. Guys!
115992 117285 A moment. Please!
118077 119579 Stop!<br />I must speak to the commander.
119871 121748 Colonel. I found it!
123833 125210 Do as he says. Open it.
130590 131591 Doctor.
139599 141601 The Lance of Longinus.
143144 145438 The blade that drew Christ's blood.
146314 147315 The Holy Lance.
157867 160036 Double the guard.<br />This is the prize the Führer seeks.
160203 161079 Colonel, we need to talk.
161246 162413 No time, Doctor.
162664 164040 The train to Berlin is waiting.
165542 166292 Search the woods!
166668 167377 Take the dogs.
168545 169921 Do you think that spy was alone?
170547 172048 Go! Go! Go! We're moving out!
172340 173091 On the double!
199075 200159 Looks like they're leaving
200243 201536 without you guys.
202829 204956 Tell us your story, or die.
205748 207083 Story...
207959 209794 Okay, okay.
209961 211713 Well...
211796 213256 It all started
213965 218011 once upon a time,<br />when this village
218094 222724 of stupid blue-eyed boys<br />decided to join hands together
222807 224893 and follow this sweaty<br />little pied piper
224976 226728 named Adolf...
325910 327996 This man was with the American.
329747 330832 This is the American's bag.
332709 333668 What have I done?
338256 339590 Bring him to my carriage.
347473 350268 Careful. This is the Führer's<br />special relic!
368202 369537 Heil Hitler!
379839 381132 Stay seated.
382008 383342 So...
386220 388139 You are a birdwatcher?
391809 393686 Yes. Because of the bombing,
393978 396606 the wagtails are following<br />a completely different trajectory.
400568 402278 We caught your accomplice.
403488 404989 The American.
470930 472181 Oh, my!
497790 499000 Get off of me!
527278 528487 There's one reason
528571 530072 you're still alive,<br />birdwatcher.
532617 534160 Who sent you?
534327 535494 What was your mission?
535661 537663 Please, Colonel, no.<br />I beg you.
537830 540124 My name is Basil Shaw.
541375 543336 I'm a professor at Oxford.
543419 544837 An archeologist.
552345 553429 There you are.
557600 559560 There is a problem.
560728 562021 I must speak to the Colonel.
562521 563522 It's urgent.
566609 568569 I have a daughter. I beg you.
569237 571948 I guarantee you will never see<br />your child again, Mr. Shaw.
573991 578246 Unless you explain<br />why your accomplice had this.
587546 588798 Sieg heil!
600810 603020 We were told<br />that the Lance of Longinus
603104 604939 could be found<br />at the fortress.
605856 607275 We were looking for it.
607775 608776 Why?
610361 611362 Because of its power?
612530 615199 It has no power.
617868 620496 My friend and I<br />were trying to save history.
623124 624583 I must speak with the Colonel.
625876 626919 It's about the Lance.
673674 675051 I only had a moment to look at it.
675259 676969 Of course,<br />my training is in physics...
677470 679430 For God's sake, spit it out!
681515 682224 The Lance...
684935 686645 It's a fake.
687271 688064 It's a fake.
688522 689648 A fake?
691901 693444 The blade is an alloy.
693611 694945 Fifty years old,
695154 697281 the engravings recent,<br />it's a replica.
697490 698491 We're dead.
701118 702244 Twelfth century.
702328 703537 Thirteenth century.
704288 705831 Ramesses II.
707249 708959 None of this stuff is fake.
711796 713381 I gotta stop this train.
713714 715049 There is another relic on this train.
716217 717635 One with real power.
718094 719220 What are you talking about?
721263 722181 The Antikythera.
722890 723557 The Antikythera?!
723808 725810 Enough about that old dial!
726060 728229 Colonel, the Führer has lost the war...
728646 730022 and his mind!
732358 733567 Let me explain.
735569 738030 The Antikythera's power<br />is not supernatural.
738489 740366 It is mathematics.
742076 743577 Whoever harnesses it...
745663 747164 will not be King...
747915 748916 nor Emperor...
750292 751502 or Führer.
755005 756799 He will be God.
775317 776861 Too many Nazis.
780698 783325 And how do you propose<br />we tell him this?
783993 784702 My Führer,
785369 787413 I'm sorry the Lance of Christ is fake.
787663 788831 But here is...
790249 793002 half of something you've never heard of.
794545 795504 Tell me,
795963 797465 have you ever met Hitler?!
800050 801135 A saboteur aboard.
801343 802636 And Hitler's Lance is gone.
842927 843928 Sieg heil!
844011 845221 That way!
848891 850184 What are you doing here?!
857566 858817 What the hell?
859818 861111 Indy?
861195 862196 Baz?
862530 863531 You're alive!
864240 865241 So far.
866116 868327 I thought I told you<br />to stay in the woods, Baz.
868494 870454 What sort of a man<br />hides in a hedge
870538 872540 while his friend<br />is facing death?
885761 889515 This lot are carting off<br />half the world's antiquities.
889682 892726 I was gonna stop 'em,<br />but now I've gotta rescue you.
893352 894812 Did you at least<br />find the Lance?
895020 896021 At least?
896105 897481 Well, have you got it?
897565 899400 - It's a fake.<br />- What?
899858 901402 A reproduction.
904238 904905 Who are you?
909618 910619 Indy?
919545 920838 The Antikythera.
922006 923674 Archimedes' Dial.
925217 926218 Bring it.
943944 945070 Hurry up, Baz.
947990 949366 Give me that.
949533 950659 Come on.
965299 966884 Get up, Baz.
967051 968260 Follow me.
968927 970220 Towards the gun?
970387 971680 Away from the Nazis!
972097 974058 Those are Nazis!
974600 976602 Get down! Down! Down!
1025859 1027027 This way. Come on!
1027611 1028612 I can't do that!
1028779 1030698 You wanna stop<br />for a little lie-down?
1034493 1035869 They have the Antikythera!
1036245 1038288 Easy.
1069194 1070195 Tunnel!
1080998 1082541 Got you! No!
1122956 1124208 Indy!
1132382 1133467 Get the gun!
1142643 1144061 Shoot him!
1146230 1148065 Not me!
1148440 1150192 Sorry.
1169503 1171505 To the victor go the spoils.
1202494 1204204 Drop the gun.
1206957 1208500 Give me the Antikythera.
1219553 1220971 Indy!
1231773 1232774 Hey!
1235861 1238196 - Here!<br />- They can't hear you, Baz.
1238739 1240115 We gotta jump!
1240282 1241617 What about my dicky knee?
1248582 1249583 Baz!
1250500 1251501 Baz!
1253337 1254379 Baz!
1255714 1257382 - Indy!<br />- Baz!
1262679 1264306 Go! Move! Move it!
1265933 1268810 Bit rum to go home<br />empty-handed after all that.
1269394 1270604 Empty-handed?
1270687 1271897 Not exactly.
1274900 1276026 Archimedes' Dial.
1276193 1277235 Well, half of it.
1277402 1279613 Come on, Baz. Let's get home.

1457415 1459251 All you really<br />need to remember
1459417 1463004 is that Assyrian ceramics<br />of this period are characterized
1463171 1467134 by this complex<br />blue-line pattern.
1467300 1468301 Okay?
1469386 1472764 I assigned pages 131<br />through 171
1472931 1474558 in Winford for today.
1474724 1476226 Anybody do the reading?
1478520 1479521 Anyone?
1482315 1484359 This is on the test.
1484526 1485735 Okay.
1486945 1488947 Guess I'll spoon-feed it<br />to you.
1491825 1494452 In 213 BC,
1494619 1496621 Roman forces led by Marcellus
1496788 1499624 laid siege<br />to the city of Syracuse.
1499791 1501459 Syracuse.
1502919 1505505 Not the Syracuse<br />in New York, Tonya.
1505672 1507257 The one in Sicily.
1508049 1510427 Amongst the defenders<br />of the city
1510594 1513680 was its most famous resident,<br />who was...
1515891 1517601 Come on, guys.<br />This is on the final.
1518310 1519895 Archimedes.
1520770 1521813 Archimedes.
1521980 1523315 Archimedes, who was a...
1523481 1524608 A mathematician.
1524774 1525942 A mathematician.
1526109 1528695 But more than that,<br />an inventor,
1528862 1531364 a brilliant engineer
1531531 1532949 who conceived of a way
1533033 1535827 to harness the energy<br />of the Mediterranean sun
1535911 1538747 on concave mirrors<br />and focus it
1538914 1541583 on attacking Roman warships<br />and set them on fire.
1541750 1545212 Who devised giant iron claws
1545378 1547964 that could snatch hostiles<br />from the sea.
1550550 1553428 But how do we know<br />it really happened?
1554554 1558558 What physical, irrefutable<br />archeological evidence
1558725 1562062 - is there of these inventions?<br />- The Antikythera.
1563438 1565607 - The Antikythera.<br />- For starters.
1565774 1567776 They're here!<br />They're downtown!
1569736 1571071 The astronauts.
1571238 1573657 Giant parade<br />this morning will be seen
1573740 1575450 by about<br />two and a half million people
1575533 1576868 lining the sidewalks...
1579913 1581331 He's coming.<br />He's come. See?
1581498 1582916 Oh, here he comes.
1583875 1584876 Hide the cake.
1586586 1588672 - Surprise.<br />- Surprise!
1592801 1595971 For over a decade now,<br />our colleague Dr. Jones
1596054 1598640 has been a loyal servant<br />of Hunter.
1600058 1601643 A token of our gratitude.
1614322 1616199 Thanks for putting up with me.
1630630 1631715 Here.
1640181 1642392 Astronauts Neil Armstrong,<br />Mike Collins,
1642475 1645353 and Buzz Aldrin will not be<br />able to avoid the spotlight.
1645520 1647439 At 11:00 a.m.<br />Eastern Daylight Time,
1647522 1649232 a grateful nation<br />will pay homage
1649399 1652027 with a ticker-tape parade<br />through New York and Chicago,
1652193 1653695 climaxed by a dinner<br />in Los Angeles...
1653862 1655196 What would the ancients say?
1655655 1657449 Neil, Buzz, and Mike...
1657615 1660368 If they knew<br />we walked on the moon?
1660535 1662078 Speaking as an ancient,
1662245 1664706 going to the moon<br />is like going to Reno.
1664873 1666166 Middle of nowhere
1667375 1668835 and no blackjack.
1669878 1671504 You don't recognize me,<br />do you?
1673840 1675884 Whatever I did, I apologize.
1676843 1677886 It's Helena.
1679471 1680513 Helena Shaw.
1682390 1683641 Wombat?
1683725 1685352 I haven't heard that<br />in a while.
1686061 1687645 - You got tall.<br />- I did.
1687812 1689105 It's fair to say.
1691232 1692317 I'm celebrating.
1693443 1695653 I'm retiring.
1696154 1697655 Well, in that case,<br />what are we drinking?
1703078 1704829 Room service for Mr. Schmidt.
1717342 1718385 Put that away.
1718468 1721012 I was asking how you broke<br />your ankle.
1721096 1723098 - None of your business.<br />- Are you Mr. Schmidt?
1723264 1725392 Doctor Schmidt.<br />He's in there.
1725558 1727060 And he don't eat anything<br />on wheels,
1727143 1728353 so put it on a table.
1729813 1731106 When I was a little boy,
1731606 1732774 I always imagined
1732941 1736653 that one day<br />man would walk on the moon.
1737195 1738321 And by golly...
1744953 1746663 Quite a celebration<br />out there, hmm?
1750083 1751543 The man you're servin',
1751709 1754003 he's the one who put<br />those astronauts on the moon.
1754170 1755213 Built the rockets<br />they rode in.
1756631 1757882 Congratulations.
1758133 1759134 Where are you from?
1760135 1761136 The Bronx, sir.
1761219 1763179 No, no. I mean originally,<br />your people.
1763346 1764347 Do you know?
1768977 1770687 I was born<br />by Yankee Stadium, sir.
1773273 1775108 And you fought<br />for your country?
1776067 1777485 320th Battalion.
1777652 1780029 Set up balloons to stop<br />the planes bombing Normandy.
1785535 1787370 And are you enjoying<br />your victory?
1795170 1796254 Will there be<br />anything else?
1798798 1800008 You didn't win the war.
1801676 1802802 Hitler lost it.
1808433 1809517 Yeah.
1810560 1813229 My field agent,<br />she found Shaw.
1814230 1815440 Yeah, I'm comin'.
1815607 1816608 Let's go, Hauke.
1819944 1821196 Where are we here?
1822280 1823781 Oxford. In the garden.
1826075 1827368 He was an original.
1829787 1831206 I just graduated.
1831372 1832373 In Archeology.
1833333 1835460 Archeology.
1835627 1837170 Apple didn't fall far.
1837337 1840048 Well, now I'm researching<br />a doctorate.
1841257 1842258 What's your subject?
1843051 1845053 The Archimedes Dial.
1845720 1847138 The Antikythera.
1850099 1851434 What do you know about that?
1851976 1853311 Well, for starters,
1853478 1856856 in 1902, Greek sponge divers<br />found a wrecked Roman warship,
1857023 1858399 huge, off the coast of Greece.
1859025 1860735 Below deck, sealed in wax,
1860902 1862445 was a clock-like mechanism,
1862612 1865406 finely tooled,<br />purpose unknown.
1865573 1867450 Nothing approximating<br />its complexity
1867534 1869536 appears in the world<br />for 1,000 years.
1870703 1872830 - You've done your homework.<br />- Well, not me.
1872997 1874415 Dad. He had<br />all these journals,
1874499 1876000 reams of notes about it.
1876167 1878002 He was obsessed till the end.
1881673 1883841 He told me you found it<br />on a Nazi plunder train.
1885301 1888388 And then lost it in a river<br />in the French Alps.
1890431 1892350 Well, that was a long time ago.
1892517 1893977 And it was only half the Dial.
1894060 1895186 - Archimedes...<br />- Archimedes broke the Dial...
1895270 1896813 - disassembled it.<br />- in two, and then hid
1896980 1898982 the two halves from the Romans<br />during the siege of Syracuse.
1899148 1900358 I know. Look.
1901442 1903319 You don't remember the last<br />time I saw you, do you?
1904988 1906114 Remember what?
1906197 1907198 These are the Alps.
1908658 1910243 Yeah, I see.
1910410 1912161 And this is the route<br />that your train took
1912245 1913288 from the Nazi stronghold
1913371 1914372 - in '44.<br />- Right.
1914539 1916332 It went through<br />this mountain pass,
1916499 1918001 and then here.
1918167 1920003 Here, it's the only river<br />on the route.
1920086 1921629 - Right.<br />- Under a bridge.
1921796 1923172 It's down there.<br />It's got to be.
1923339 1925758 - And nobody knows except us.<br />- Us?
1926050 1927552 Well, I mean, you.
1927719 1929262 And me. So, yeah.
1929429 1931264 - Us.<br />- Us.
1932265 1934767 And what were you<br />thinking exactly?
1936227 1937312 Well, that maybe...
1939147 1940690 we could go there.
1940857 1941899 And?
1942066 1943151 And find it. And...
1944068 1945695 And I'd become...
1947322 1948489 famous.
1948656 1950950 Oh, well, not famous.<br />Renowned. Feted.
1951534 1953328 A feted archeologist.
1953494 1955204 And you, a final triumph!
1955288 1956414 Indiana Jones!
1956497 1958541 Out with a bang!<br />Back in the saddle!
1961586 1963004 I'm not selling this, am I?
1965506 1966716 Wombat...
1968843 1970678 why are you chasing the thing
1972430 1974515 that drove your father crazy?
1980480 1981898 Wouldn't you?
2000124 2001125 I got it.
2001209 2002210 Parade's comin' soon.
2003252 2004253 So, what we got?
2006005 2008383 She's in there, third floor,<br />with an old guy.
2008549 2009676 Who is he, a Russian?
2009842 2011761 No, a professor.<br />Dr. Henry Jones.
2012845 2013846 Klaber!
2014347 2016432 Klaber, get back here!<br />You're not an agent!
2016599 2017892 God damn it! Go.
2018059 2020645 I'll get support up here<br />and pull a file on Jones.
2041290 2042542 This way.
2078703 2081789 Basil became obsessed<br />by this German theory.
2083332 2084709 Conjecture, really.
2087253 2088880 Archimedes had figured out
2088963 2091966 that the movements<br />of the moon and planets
2092842 2094051 weren't perfect.
2095303 2097805 There were irregularities<br />in their rotations.
2098973 2101267 He thought these<br />irregularities might
2101434 2104812 explain fluctuations<br />in temperature, tides.
2106939 2108232 Storms, even.
2109609 2112487 So, he set about building<br />a device to predict them.
2114197 2115990 But then, he stumbled upon
2116073 2118117 a method to predict<br />even larger
2118868 2119869 disturbances.
2121746 2123164 Larger disturbances?
2123790 2126000 Your father<br />thought this thing could
2126709 2128961 predict fissures in time.
2145978 2147480 Hauke, if you don't...
2149899 2152109 Found 'em.
2159659 2160743 Hello.
2161786 2163996 Are you looking for...
2164163 2165331 Dr. Jones?
2169001 2170253 Excuse me, can I help you?
2170837 2171838 No, thank you.
2171921 2173631 Just a routine investigation,<br />ma'am.
2174715 2177218 Are you the police?
2177301 2178719 It'll just be a few moments.
2178886 2180596 - Professor Plimpton.<br />- Ma'am.
2180680 2181681 - Professor Plimpton!<br />- Ma'am!
2186394 2187395 Drop your weapon.
2187770 2188771 What the hell are you doin'?
2190064 2192233 What the doctor tells me,<br />Miss Mason.
2192316 2193317 Mandy?
2197947 2199991 Yeah, no witnesses.
2204370 2206455 Jesus. What the hell?
2206747 2208124 Your father wrote<br />so many letters
2208207 2210042 about the Dial,<br />I stopped reading 'em.
2213170 2214171 You really don't remember
2214255 2215882 the last time<br />I was at your house?
2217842 2219719 I took that from him then.
2221345 2222930 I thought he'd stopped<br />thinking about it.
2223014 2224015 But your father was convinced
2224098 2227101 this thing was real<br />and dangerous.
2227268 2229228 Do not shoot.
2229645 2233065 He was terrified that if somebody found<br />this legendary tablet,
2233232 2234358 the Grafikos...
2234525 2235526 The tablet<br />containing directions
2235610 2236694 to the rest of the Dial.
2236861 2237987 And if they found<br />the Grafikos,
2238154 2239614 they might acquire<br />the other half of the Dial
2239697 2240698 and put the two together.
2242366 2243576 I knew<br />you wouldn't destroy it.
2247204 2249040 How did you know<br />he asked me to destroy it?
2249916 2251918 - What?<br />- You do remember that night.
2252668 2254587 I was 12 years old, Indy.
2254670 2256088 You knew we didn't drop it<br />in a river.
2256923 2258841 - Baz didn't tell you that.<br />- See, listen.
2258925 2260176 - I didn't...<br />- No, he never lied.
2260718 2261969 - No...<br />- What was all that crap
2262053 2263095 - about the map?<br />- You...
2263262 2264305 No, you've had<br />too many whiskeys.
2265181 2266182 What are you doing, Wombat?
2266265 2267600 Stay where you are.
2268809 2269810 Don't move.
2270561 2272063 - Who are these people?<br />- We need to get out of here.
2272146 2273147 Are they with you?
2273230 2274482 Not an inch, Miss Shaw.
2275691 2276692 Miss Shaw, stop!
2280363 2281364 Helena!
2286160 2287161 Stop!
2289121 2290122 Sorry.
2290206 2293167 - Helena!<br />- Dr. Jones. It's over.
2293334 2294543 Who are you people?
2294710 2295795 What do you want?
2297630 2298631 Stop!
2300716 2301717 Helena Shaw!
2301801 2303260 She's on the roof.<br />Find another way up.
2303344 2304428 Dr. Jones!
2304887 2306263 Dr. Jones,<br />we're not gonna hurt you.
2332790 2334083 Move.<br />We gotta follow 'em.
2334166 2335292 Go. Hurry up.
2362862 2363863 Fan out!
2376667 2378169 All right, let's go.<br />Move, move, move! Pack it up!
2378252 2379253 Come on,<br />get everything.
2379420 2380546 Found her!
2408991 2411285 - Operator.<br />- I need the police.
2411452 2413746 Hunter College.<br />People are dead.
2413829 2414997 - Please...<br />- Hang up, fella.
2420878 2421962 Stand up.
2427426 2428511 Okay, okay.
2452868 2454328 She's gone. You blew it,
2454495 2455746 you trigger-happy cracker.
2455913 2458374 - She had it in her hand.<br />- We got the professor.
2461961 2463129 Here's the file on Jones.
2463212 2464213 Yes.
2482481 2483524 Who are you?
2483691 2485151 That's my question.
2495661 2497121 You're CIA.
2497288 2499039 Oh, not me, man.
2499206 2501167 I don't take government jobs.
2501333 2502418 Okay.
2503711 2505880 How are you acquainted<br />with Miss Shaw?
2506255 2507506 She's my goddaughter.
2508257 2509884 I haven't seen her<br />in 18 years.
2510050 2511135 Why did you<br />meet with her today?
2511218 2512219 To give her the Dial?
2513596 2516056 Lady, it's an ancient<br />hunk of gears.
2517016 2518058 Half a hunk.
2518142 2519810 Oh, it's a lot more than that.
2522813 2524064 Where do you think<br />you're going?
2524231 2525608 I got a parade going on.
2525774 2527234 And a demonstration<br />coming down here.
2527401 2528444 Hey! Hey, hey!
2529111 2530154 - Hey...<br />- Shut up.
2530321 2532740 I can't go this way.<br />Gotta go back.
2537745 2539496 Hell no!<br />What is wrong with you, man?
2539663 2541290 Damn it! Let's go on foot.
2541457 2542541 You heard her.
2544210 2545294 What the hell<br />were you thinking?
2545377 2546670 - Walk! Come on.<br />- What is your problem?
2546754 2547755 You don't look<br />when you're backin' up?
2547838 2549381 - Take care of that guy.<br />- Who's gonna pay for that?
2549465 2550591 Easy, fella. Easy.
2550674 2551675 Keep movin'.
2551759 2553510 Can't you see my cab?<br />It's yellow.
2553594 2555179 No, you're gonna have to pay<br />for this bodywork, man.
2555262 2556263 I don't...
2558140 2560434 Peace now! Peace now!
2561852 2564688 Stop the war!<br />Stop the fighting!
2564855 2566607 - Where are we going, Mason?<br />- This way.
2568651 2570236 - Hell no, we won't go.<br />- Shut up.
2570402 2571820 - Hell no, we won't go!<br />- Hell no!
2572154 2574698 - Hell no, we won't go!<br />- Hell no, we won't go!
2574782 2575783 We won't go!
2575950 2578327 - Hell no, we won't go!<br />- Hell no, we won't go!
2578911 2580329 - Hell no...<br />- Shut up!
2580496 2581497 Hell yeah!
2581789 2583666 Hell no, we won't go!
2583749 2585584 Hell no, we won't go!
2585668 2589129 Hell no, we won't go!<br />Hell no, we won't go!
2589213 2591465 Hell no, we won't go!<br />Hell no, we won't go!
2591548 2592549 Hell no...
2592967 2596512 Hell no, we won't go!<br />Hell no, we won't go!
2603477 2604770 Hey!
2605229 2607231 Officer! Help me!
2607982 2609566 Officer,<br />there was a shooting...
2609650 2611485 - All right, all right.<br />- This morning at Hunter.
2611652 2613404 People are dead. God damn it.
2613487 2615197 Some rogue maniacs<br />broke in and...
2615281 2616907 Sir, you need to calm it down.
2617074 2618284 Please listen to me.
2618450 2620577 There was a shooting<br />this morning, and the...
2620744 2624164 They're in a Con Ed van<br />right around the corner!
2626750 2628377 Hey! What do you think<br />you're doing?
2640556 2641890 - Watch out!<br />- What's he doin'?
2691106 2692941 Move, out the way!
2700282 2701533 Watch out!
2703452 2704620 Move! Quickly!
2718884 2720302 Move! Move!
2730896 2732231 Go, go, go!
2752876 2754962 Come on.<br />That's ridiculous.
2755045 2756547 - It's a horse.<br />- Come on.
2759049 2760884 - Hey, mister.<br />- Move! Out of the way!
2761218 2763011 - Hold my horse.<br />- Move! Move!
2763095 2764096 Transfer is available
2764179 2766265 for IND Queens Boulevard.
2775691 2778694 Next stop, 59th,<br />Lexington Avenue.
2780571 2782865 Subway is faster.
2783365 2785117 People tend<br />to romanticize science,
2785200 2787161 when it is, in fact,<br />quite cold.
2787327 2788829 So, what's next,<br />Dr. Schmidt?
2789955 2791039 Mars?
2791832 2793250 No, we've conquered space.
2795085 2796795 I'm moving<br />to the next frontier.
2798255 2800674 What's beyond space?
2804303 2806221 You might wanna<br />get that suit pressed,
2806305 2807306 Dr. Schmidt.
2807931 2809558 We leave for the airport<br />in an hour.
2809933 2811018 He's gonna meet the President.
2811101 2812686 If the President objects<br />to a few creases,
2812769 2815105 perhaps he should find himself<br />another physicist.
2816106 2817941 - Can I use that?<br />- No.
2818317 2819401 Yes.
2819485 2821528 Baxter.
2825699 2826825 It's for you, Doctor.
2830579 2832706 I may wanna leave a bit later<br />for Los Angeles.
2832789 2835042 I'm expecting<br />a delivery shortly.
2838212 2839213 Speak.
2839296 2840797 Your goons made a mess.
2840964 2842132 Did they?
2842299 2844718 Miss Shaw met<br />with a professor. Jones.
2845344 2847095 She acquired the device<br />from him.
2848013 2849097 Then we lost her.
2850766 2852434 Dr. Jones got away as well.
2852851 2854019 Is that so?
2854186 2855521 Most unfortunate.
2855896 2857356 I gotta clean things<br />up here, Doctor.
2857439 2858440 And as a representative
2858524 2859983 of the United States<br />government,
2860067 2861777 I urge you to cooperate.
2861860 2863153 Get on that plane<br />to Los Angeles,
2864071 2865322 and get your medal<br />from the President.
2872955 2874039 Hello?
2874540 2876708 Call our friends<br />and secure a private charter.
2878126 2879127 To Morocco.
2879211 2880379 Yes, sir.
2881296 2882548 The university murders
2882631 2884591 took place at the height<br />of the parade.
2884675 2885759 Police are searching
2885842 2888095 for retired professor<br />Dr. Henry Jones.
2888262 2891265 A colleague told ABC that<br />Jones recently lost his son
2891431 2893433 and was in the middle<br />of a divorce.
2895644 2898855 This guy,<br />he looks like you.
2899815 2902192 Nah. No.
2904152 2906154 - It is you.<br />- No, no, no. Hey.
2906238 2907864 - Go home, pal. You're drunk.<br />- This is the guy!
2907948 2909283 - Hey!<br />- It's the killer!
2911952 2913370 Sorry I'm late, Indy.
2913537 2914955 Bridge traffic.
2925841 2928010 Boy, am I glad<br />to see you, Sallah.
2928844 2930846 I wish I could say the same,<br />old friend.
2934141 2936059 Quickly, Indy. Inside.
2939855 2942149 Your goddaughter, Helena,
2942316 2944985 was arrested in Tangier<br />last year
2945068 2947904 for auctioning contraband.
2950365 2951450 There's more.
2952492 2955912 She was bailed out<br />by Aziz Rahim.
2956663 2959583 Aziz Rahim is the son<br />of Big Rahim,
2959666 2962419 a well-known Moroccan mobster.
2963962 2967633 Big Rahim<br />owns the Hotel Atlantique
2967799 2970385 in Tangier, and this week,
2970552 2974681 the hotel is hosting<br />its annual auction
2974848 2976725 of stolen antiquities.
2977893 2980395 All the big players<br />are already there.
2980562 2982356 Alia, Jabari.
2982522 2984775 This is the great man<br />who brought our family
2984858 2986693 to America during the war.
2986860 2989237 Quick, when was<br />the Suez Crisis?
2989321 2991782 1956.
2992240 2993617 Very impressive, Jabari.
2993784 2996203 My grandchildren watch<br />too much TV,
2996370 2998914 but they know their history.
2999081 3003210 They understand what it is<br />to be American and Egyptian.
3004086 3006254 I need a ride<br />to the airport, Sallah.
3007339 3009841 If you run, the police will<br />assume that you're guilty.
3010550 3011885 Without Helena or the Dial,
3011968 3013887 I'm gonna get framed<br />for murder.
3015055 3016682 Have you thought<br />about calling Marion?
3017766 3019101 She doesn't wanna talk to me.
3025273 3026483 Welcome to New York's
3026566 3028860 John F. Kennedy<br />International Airport.
3029695 3031988 The upper level is<br />for Pan American Airlines...
3032155 3033990 I took something else<br />from your apartment.
3034157 3035367 It was under the bed.
3040580 3041623 Thanks, Sallah.
3043875 3045669 I also brought my passport.
3047713 3048922 I could help you.
3049089 3050090 In Tangier?
3050173 3051800 Wherever chance takes us.
3052718 3053802 Indy, I...
3054720 3056179 I miss the desert.
3056763 3058056 I miss the sea.
3059599 3061393 And I miss waking up<br />every morning
3061560 3062978 wondering what<br />wonderful adventure
3063061 3064688 the new day will bring to us.
3065647 3067649 This is not<br />an adventure, Sallah.
3069109 3071695 Those days have come and gone.
3071862 3072904 Perhaps.
3073071 3074406 Perhaps not.
3078869 3081288 Give 'em hell, Indiana Jones!
3093091 3094176 Champagne?
3094551 3096428 We've got four more hours<br />to Tangier.
3104186 3105604 Your scotch, sir.
3106229 3107230 Thanks.
3114154 3115530 Basil. Come on, Baz!
3115697 3117449 - Open the door!<br />- No!
3117616 3119117 - Stay out, Indy!<br />- Open the door.
3122329 3124206 The Germans were right, Indy.
3124289 3126666 - What?<br />- It's too big. It's too much.
3126833 3128502 Hey, Ba... Hey, hey! Hey, Baz!
3128585 3129586 - Give me...<br />- No.
3129669 3130670 What are you doing?
3130754 3131963 You've listened<br />to nothing that I said.
3132047 3133840 I don't understand it, Baz!
3134174 3136134 Well, I was trying to<br />explain it to you downstairs.
3136218 3137511 You've just<br />ignored everything.
3137594 3138595 You're terrifying<br />your daughter.
3140764 3142849 Indy, Archimedes
3143016 3145227 discovered<br />a temporal meteorology.
3145435 3148063 Archimedes was<br />a mathematician, Baz,
3148230 3149439 not a magician.
3149606 3152067 He could predict<br />fissures in time.
3152234 3153777 Fissures in time?
3154152 3157197 - Baz, you can't prove that!<br />- Well, not yet.
3157364 3159241 Proving it<br />is what makes it science!
3174506 3175715 Oh, Baz.
3177425 3178969 I never should've<br />given you the thing.
3179219 3181179 It... It belongs in a museum.
3182097 3183807 Give it to me. Please.
3187394 3188770 If I give you this,
3189980 3191439 it must be destroyed.
3192941 3194025 I will.
3196653 3198071 I'll destroy it, Baz.
3200574 3201575 Promise.
3207706 3209207 I'm sorry about this.
3209374 3210584 It's all my fault.
3212794 3214254 - Are you gonna be here?<br />- Yes, sir.
3214337 3216423 Okay. I've gotta catch<br />an airplane.
3216590 3219384 If anyone finds the Grafikos,<br />they'll have both halves.
3219467 3220802 Some things<br />should stay buried.
3220886 3221887 I know, Baz.
3221970 3223179 It's vital<br />that you destroy it.
3223263 3224681 - I will, Baz.<br />- Do you understand?
3224764 3226391 - I'll destroy it. Yes.<br />- Say you will, Indy.
3226474 3227475 I will... Yes.
3227559 3229185 You promised me.<br />Remember that.
3229269 3230312 I will... I promise.
3230395 3231438 There's a reason,
3231521 3234107 a reason that Archimedes<br />broke it in two.
3234274 3235984 I know, Baz.
3236151 3238278 Indy.
3239029 3240322 Thanks, Wombat.
3240488 3242449 He's gonna be all right<br />in a few days.
3244534 3245952 I'll call you<br />as soon as I land.
3250957 3252375 Ladies and gentlemen,
3252459 3254920 we are 20 minutes<br />from landing in Tangier.
3288703 3290080 - Stop drinking!<br />- What are you doing?
3290163 3291831 No more champagne!<br />How many more...
3291915 3292958 I'm staying.
3293041 3294501 Go home. Go home!
3310016 3311101 Rahim.
3311184 3313520 Miss Shaw, she's here.
3317774 3318942 Forged in bronze.
3319025 3320068 Nearly complete.
3320151 3321861 It is an astrological clock.
3322445 3324656 Dating third century BC
3324823 3328743 and built<br />by Archimedes himself.
3330787 3332205 All right,<br />let's start at 20,000.
3332288 3333456 20,000, thank you very much.
3333623 3334958 30. 30.
3335125 3337794 Gauges green, power full,
3337961 3340296 and when I reach 85, I rotate.
3340880 3341881 What next?
3341965 3343258 Louis, help him! He's so cute.
3343341 3345385 - Pull back on the yoke.<br />- I did, man. I'm airborne.
3345468 3346469 Yeah, he's airborne.
3346553 3347846 - Can I have a sip?<br />- Do I pick up the flaps?
3347929 3349931 Don't touch the flaps<br />under 400 feet.
3350098 3351766 Decrease your pitch<br />to get to 120.
3351933 3352934 All right.
3355520 3357772 - Private auction, old timer.<br />- I've gotta get in there.
3357939 3360442 No password, no entry.<br />I don't make the rules.
3363278 3364320 And what is the current bid?
3364404 3366406 - The bid is 50,000.<br />- Then I bid 55.
3366489 3368033 Who'll give me 60?
3368116 3369659 - 60.<br />- 60. 65?
3369743 3371077 65. 70?
3371161 3372495 - 75.<br />- 75. 80?
3372579 3373580 - 80.<br />- 85.
3373663 3374873 How about 90?
3381629 3383882 - This auction is private.<br />- This auction's over.
3384299 3385633 Au contraire,<br />it's hardly begun.
3385717 3387177 - 100.<br />- 100,000.
3387343 3388887 I like the hat, by the way.
3388970 3390305 Makes you look<br />at least two years younger.
3390472 3391639 Thanks.
3391723 3392724 - 110, bravo.<br />- I told you that
3392807 3394768 - this auction is over.<br />- Excuse me, who is this man?
3394934 3396394 - I'm her godfather.<br />- He's mildly related.
3396478 3398396 And she's up past her bedtime.
3398563 3399773 - Come on, Wombat.<br />- I wouldn't do that.
3399939 3401441 You want to explain it<br />to the cops at the bar?
3401608 3402942 The ones I paid off?
3403485 3405070 You're out of your depth,<br />Jonesy.
3405236 3406654 - Jonesy?<br />- He thinks I'm a criminal.
3406738 3408490 He's the one<br />wanted for murder.
3408656 3410700 Nice big picture<br />in the New York Herald. 130?
3410867 3412452 I didn't kill anyone.
3412535 3413536 No entry,<br />it's a private auction.
3413620 3414829 And you know it,<br />Helena.
3415330 3418500 But whoever did<br />was looking for this.
3419167 3421044 What you've got here<br />is Pandora's Box.
3422295 3423505 No, actually.
3424380 3425840 It's my box.
3428468 3429469 You.
3431179 3432305 Have we met?
3432597 3433598 No.
3433681 3435100 My memory<br />is a little fuzzy,
3435183 3436893 but your face rings a bell.
3437477 3438520 Are you still a Nazi?
3442649 3444818 You're confused.<br />My name is Schmidt.
3445401 3447570 Professor Schmidt<br />of Alabama University.
3449280 3451574 Professor Schmidt. How nice<br />to meet you in person.
3451658 3453201 150.
3453284 3454369 After our conversation,<br />Miss Shaw,
3454536 3456496 I thought we'd come to<br />an agreement about the Dial.
3456579 3457580 Funny. The last time
3457664 3458957 I saw the other guy<br />who looks like you,
3459040 3460792 he was also after this.
3461376 3463002 Your numbers were light,<br />Professor Schmidt.
3463086 3465004 But good news is, you're here<br />now. The bid is 160.
3465088 3466923 You don't seem<br />to understand, Miss Shaw.
3467006 3468299 This relic is my property.
3468383 3470885 - It's not yours. You stole it.<br />- Then you stole it.
3471052 3472637 And then I stole it.<br />It's called capitalism.
3472720 3473763 The bid is 160.
3473847 3474848 - 160.<br />- 170?
3474931 3475932 You should've<br />stayed in New York.
3476015 3477016 - 170?<br />- You should've stayed
3477100 3479894 - out of Poland.<br />- 170. Anyone? Anyone?
3480061 3481354 Going, going...
3481729 3482730 Gone!
3483356 3484357 Stay away!
3486109 3487110 Get the Dial.
3491072 3492782 Stay away!
3502083 3503084 Oh, hello, Claude.
3503168 3504544 You should not<br />have come back, Helena.
3513511 3514929 Get back.
3525648 3526649 Teddy!
3541039 3542165 Rahim says you stay.
3553968 3554969 Thank you.
3568066 3569525 See you in the past,<br />Dr. Jones.
3596552 3597553 It's my cab!
3603142 3604310 Tell them to back off.
3604477 3605853 I just told them to shoot you.
3607939 3609148 All right, guys.
3610525 3611901 Put the guns down.
3612068 3613278 Put 'em down.
3615238 3616239 All right.
3617907 3619200 That's better.
3623079 3624706 Oh, dear.
3634757 3635883 Rahim.
3636968 3638469 You're in pajamas.
3638970 3640638 I was sleeping, Helena.
3640722 3641806 Peacefully.
3642974 3644809 My father woke me.
3644976 3647603 He told me you'd<br />returned to our hotel.
3649105 3651357 Then he handed me<br />this scimitar
3651524 3654360 and told me to come home<br />with your head.
3656195 3657488 Does it have to be that bit?
3665246 3668041 I thought maybe you returned<br />because you loved me.
3668207 3669334 Rahim,
3670084 3671669 I had an item to sell.
3671836 3673713 Excuse me. The item<br />she's talking about
3673796 3674797 - actually belongs to me.<br />- No.
3674881 3676174 You do not need to intrude<br />in this conversation.
3676257 3677383 And some very bad people,<br />worse people...
3677467 3678676 You do not need to get<br />involved with my business.
3678760 3680219 - Have run off with it.<br />- Is this your new man?
3680303 3682013 - No. No, no, no, no.<br />- It's complicated.
3683348 3684849 What exactly<br />do you owe this guy?
3685016 3687101 Just some bail money<br />and a lifetime of happiness.
3687268 3688936 I presume you sold the ring.
3689103 3690438 It didn't go for as much<br />as I thought it would.
3690897 3691939 I'll do it!
3692023 3693107 What are you... Hey!
3699447 3700948 You just got me killed!
3701115 3703701 Well, I'm not the one that's<br />engaged to a mobster!
3703868 3706788 I don't need morality lessons<br />from an aging grave robber!
3706954 3708164 I'm not a grave robber.
3708331 3710333 Your father and I<br />did important work together.
3713002 3714587 Don't tell me<br />all your escapades were noble,
3714670 3716297 selfless quests.<br />You did it for the buzz!
3719008 3720051 Oh, good work, Teddy!
3721552 3723221 - Move over, kid.<br />- Hey!
3733940 3735817 - Helena!<br />- Back up! Back up!
3753709 3754710 Not this way!
3754794 3756462 You don't know where you're<br />going, Indy! Listen to him.
3756546 3757880 - He knows this town!<br />- I know Tangier!
3762385 3763428 There he is!
3768558 3770685 Faster. Go faster!
3770852 3772770 Ten minutes<br />to the airport, boss.
3774772 3776107 I'm not sure<br />Professor Schmidt
3776190 3777483 is an actual professor,<br />by the way.
3777650 3778860 - He's a Nazi!<br />- Turn left!
3778943 3780486 Turn left! Turn left!
3780570 3781737 - Oh, no!<br />- No!
3796419 3798379 Helena! Don't do this!
3806345 3807889 - Hey, this way!<br />- That way!
3808848 3809849 No!
3810808 3812310 Helena!
3814479 3815480 No!
3825072 3826616 What the hell?
3833247 3834499 Helena!
3836459 3838336 Hey! Hey!
3838920 3840505 What the hell?
3843216 3844258 Come on!
3848054 3849889 Come on. Come on!
3883756 3885633 You think<br />he'd be proud of this?
3886551 3887552 Who?
3888886 3890012 Your father!
3890096 3893140 His only daughter selling<br />her soul for bail money!
3893307 3894767 Sounds quite cool<br />when you put it like that.
3894850 3896477 And it's not all bail money.
3896561 3897853 Some of it's gambling debt
3897937 3899021 - and some...<br />- Thank you, Teddy.
3899105 3900898 Helena! No!
3900982 3901983 Helena!
3903693 3905570 How did you end up like this?
3905736 3907071 Well, you mean resourceful?
3907238 3909574 Daring? Beautiful?<br />Self-sufficient?
3934890 3936350 Hold on!
3939437 3940438 Go this way!
3949822 3950823 There he is.
3962877 3964045 Stop!
3964128 3965921 - Hey! Hey!<br />- Stop!
3978643 3979810 On the left!
3980936 3981937 Take the wheel, Teddy!
3984148 3985191 What are you doing?
3985358 3986901 Getting what's mine.
3987860 3988861 Helena!
3993074 3995201 Damn it! You crazy?
3996661 3999163 Hey! Helena!
4003125 4004752 - Take the gun!<br />- Miss Shaw.
4006170 4007838 Let go, Miss Shaw!
4030277 4031696 Let go.
4031779 4034156 Come on! Give me the Dial!
4034907 4036951 Helena!
4038327 4039787 Damn.
4046544 4047670 Turn back! They went that way!
4047753 4048754 He's gone!
4048838 4050673 - Move over!<br />- Hey!
4054093 4057054 I didn't come here to<br />rescue you from your fiancé!
4057138 4058139 Rescue me?
4063310 4064937 I just want the Dial back.
4084373 4086000 Put your hands<br />above your head.
4087126 4088586 Not the smoothest<br />break-up I ever had.
4088669 4089920 If your father<br />was still alive...
4090004 4091046 Well, he's not, Indy.
4091130 4092631 Hey, something's wrong<br />with the engine.
4092715 4093924 If only there'd been<br />someone there for me,
4094008 4095509 some father figure, someone
4095593 4097720 specifically anointed<br />for the job.
4097887 4099180 You have no idea<br />about the kind...
4099263 4100264 Don't beat yourself up<br />about it.
4100347 4102391 I mean,<br />what even is a godfather?
4103392 4105436 Anyway, family never<br />was your strong suit.
4106103 4108439 - What is the time, by the way?<br />- It's...
4108606 4109607 Hey, no fair.
4110316 4111358 Give me that back.
4111442 4112651 That was my father's watch!
4115070 4116071 Give it back to him.
4120534 4121952 You're gonna have<br />to leave town with me.
4122119 4123621 Rahim will be<br />looking for you too.
4123788 4124997 They'll go to<br />Tangier airport first,
4125080 4126081 so we'll need to catch a train
4126165 4127333 and get a plane<br />from Casablanca.
4128209 4130419 What was that?
4135508 4136509 Damn.
4138928 4140012 Yeah.
4140095 4141222 I know, sir.
4143432 4144433 Yes...
4145684 4146685 Copy.
4151774 4153067 They pulled the plug.
4153150 4154527 You got them scared.
4154902 4156070 Because they don't understand.
4156153 4157738 No. Because your associates
4157822 4159156 killed three<br />American civilians
4159323 4161575 and blew up<br />a nationally televised parade.
4161742 4162910 Because you stood up
4162993 4164703 the President<br />of the United States,
4164870 4166038 ran to Morocco,
4166205 4168582 and created an incident that<br />required military extraction!
4170709 4172419 Then take me to DC,<br />and I will explain it all.
4172503 4173921 They want you to vanish.
4174088 4176215 We have half the Dial now.
4176382 4177716 They were just trying<br />to keep you happy,
4178717 4180386 letting you chase that thing.
4180553 4181595 They never cared about it.
4181679 4182763 They will, Miss Mason,
4182847 4184473 when they understand<br />what it can do.
4184640 4185766 You put them on the moon.
4186475 4187726 They got what they wanted.
4189019 4190938 All right, buckle up.<br />We're landing in Spain.
4191564 4193566 C-9 transport will take you<br />from there to Maxwell.
4193732 4195192 I'm not going back to Alabama!
4195359 4197611 All we need is a vessel to<br />take us to the Mediterranean.
4198279 4199697 The Grafikos<br />will take us to the other...
4199780 4201866 Please, Miss Mason. Please.
4202032 4203075 Let go of me, Schmidt.
4203242 4204869 I'm asking you personally.
4205786 4207204 You're a piece of work, Doc.
4208747 4209748 Hey!
4237776 4239278 Schmidt...
4240195 4241822 My name is Voller.
4244617 4245993 Jürgen Voller.
4259256 4261050 That's a Sea Stallion.
4261216 4262635 American helicopter.
4263636 4265346 Did you know<br />the Wright Brothers?
4265804 4267264 - What?<br />- The Wright Brothers.
4267431 4268515 Orville and Wilbur.
4268682 4270935 They invented the airplane,<br />and they lived in Indiana.
4271101 4272645 Wilbur was born in Indiana.
4272811 4275230 I'm not from Indiana, Teddy.
4275314 4277942 And the Wright Brothers were<br />born during the Civil War.
4278108 4280235 Oh, I thought maybe you went<br />to school with them.
4281654 4284114 Oh, come on, Indy.<br />That was funny.
4284281 4285574 Funny?
4286241 4287534 I'm stuck in Tangier
4287618 4289954 with a broken tuk-tuk<br />and two thieves.
4290120 4291330 I'm wanted for murder.
4291413 4293415 Nazis have<br />half of Archimedes' Dial
4293582 4295000 and your father's notebooks.
4296210 4297378 I have a copy.
4298212 4299672 Dad's notebooks.<br />I made a copy.
4299755 4301674 Where?
4301757 4303717 You memorized five notebooks?
4303884 4305094 Seven. And of course not.
4305260 4306887 Half of them were<br />as dull as ditchwater.
4307763 4310182 Just the really<br />important bits.
4311058 4312059 Like what?
4312518 4313644 The location of the Grafikos.
4313811 4315521 Nobody knows<br />where the Grafikos is.
4315688 4317022 - Dad did.<br />- No, he didn't.
4317189 4318357 - Yes, he did.<br />- No, he didn't.
4318524 4320150 - Yes, he did.<br />- What's a Grafikos?
4320317 4321610 It's directions<br />to the rest of the Dial.
4321777 4323278 Ask her if she knows<br />what language it's in.
4323362 4325364 It isn't in a language.<br />It's in a code.
4325531 4326740 What code?
4326907 4328367 Archimedes used two codes.
4328534 4330077 Linear B and Polybius Square.
4330244 4331870 So, even if you find<br />the Grafikos,
4331954 4333580 without me, you can't read it.
4333664 4335416 Please.
4335582 4337418 Dad taught me Polybius<br />when I was nine.
4337584 4339253 Used to leave little notes<br />around the house.
4339336 4340337 Tidy your room.
4340421 4341714 Stay away from my brandy.
4342840 4343882 What if it's Linear B?
4344842 4346218 50 quid it's Polybius.
4347261 4348387 Give me that.
4348470 4349471 Hey.
4349888 4351098 That won't work.
4351265 4353517 Moroccan chewing gum's made<br />from the sap of the Manilkara.
4353684 4354977 Heat resistant.
4356478 4357688 Try and start it.
4362609 4363777 - Start it.<br />- I am.
4368157 4369742 It won't hold.
4369908 4371827 It'll get us<br />to the train station.
4371994 4373120 Us?
4373287 4374496 - You goin' home?<br />- No.
4374663 4376457 I'm going to Casablanca.
4376623 4378375 Then I'm gonna hop a plane<br />to the Aegean.
4378459 4379460 Just like you.
4379877 4381420 What makes you think<br />we're going to the Aegean?
4381587 4384673 You gotta get to the Grafikos<br />before the Nazis.
4384840 4386925 Archimedes was<br />surrounded by Romans.
4387634 4388844 Where else would it be?
4389011 4390012 The Aegean is huge, Indy.
4390179 4391305 And you don't<br />have coordinates.
4391472 4393015 And you don't have a boat.
4395934 4398353 I've got an old friend<br />in Greece.
4398520 4399897 An expert diver.
4400064 4401899 With a big, beautiful boat
4402066 4404109 that'll get us there<br />before they will.
4404985 4407029 You need me,
4407196 4408405 and you know it.
4458539 4459790 Renny!
4461875 4462918 Indy?
4463752 4464795 Indy!
4470259 4472219 So, that's the expert diver?
4472386 4474596 Spain's greatest frogman.
4476765 4478392 Hey!
4478559 4480644 So, Spain's greatest frogman<br />has a shit boat
4480727 4482020 and only one good frog leg?
4482187 4483230 Stop it.
4487025 4488235 You got<br />a different boat.
4488318 4489528 Stop it.
4503792 4504835 We're going here.
4506461 4508922 Where they found the first<br />part of the Antikythera.
4509840 4511008 But...
4512342 4513635 we're going deeper.
4515220 4517222 Dad tracked down<br />the old sponge diver
4517306 4518932 who found the Dial.
4519099 4520267 He told him
4520434 4523395 that the wrecked Roman ship<br />broke up under the sea
4523562 4524688 70 feet below.
4524855 4527816 Filled with the skeletons<br />of over 100 centurions.
4528984 4530152 That's where they found it.
4530903 4534823 But he said that most<br />of the ship had broken off
4534990 4536742 and sunk to the ocean floor.
4537701 4539286 Too deep for sponge divers.
4540329 4543165 So, Dad started wondering<br />why a Roman warship
4543332 4546710 would sail out of Syracuse<br />with 100 centurions on board.
4550422 4553800 They weren't taking<br />half a Dial for a joyride.
4557638 4559223 They had the Grafikos...
4562100 4564269 and they were looking<br />for the rest of the Dial.
4567564 4569191 Your dad was a genius.
4569816 4570859 Yeah.
4572277 4573320 He was.
4593173 4594174 Seven of spades.
4597469 4598553 How do you do that?
4600222 4601431 Do it again.
4605435 4607312 Pick a card, Dr. Jones.
4614820 4615946 Seven of spades!
4618073 4619116 She's magic.
4619283 4620450 Trick deck.
4620617 4621618 No.
4622786 4624204 I force the card.
4624371 4625664 I offer the mark,
4625831 4626999 you,
4627165 4628166 the feeling of a choice,
4628333 4630544 but ultimately, I make you<br />pick the card I want.
4632671 4633839 The mark.
4636883 4638802 Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day.
4638885 4640721 I have to check the lines.
4646768 4647853 Good night.
4650981 4654109 You remember seeing any dates<br />in your father's notebooks?
4655444 4656820 Dates?
4656903 4658280 What dates?
4659197 4660198 These dates.
4663910 4666371 Written over and over again<br />in this letter.
4667789 4669624 August 20th, 1969.
4669791 4671335 That's three days from now.
4671501 4673754 And the same date in 1939.
4673920 4676340 Two weeks before<br />Hitler invades Poland.
4678175 4679760 Wait.
4680552 4682888 Now you believe the Dial<br />has magical powers?
4684181 4686224 I don't believe in magic,<br />Wombat.
4688101 4690479 But a few times in my life,<br />I've seen things.
4693607 4695359 Things I can't explain.
4696693 4699071 And I've come to believe<br />it's not so much
4699237 4701365 what you believe.
4701531 4703784 It's how hard you believe it.
4706912 4708246 I've seen things too, Indy.
4709164 4711708 The only thing<br />worth believing in, ever,
4711875 4713543 is cash.
4715837 4716922 Right.
4722719 4723845 What if you could<br />go back in time?
4726181 4727224 What would you do?
4728600 4730018 Witness the Trojan War?
4731311 4732646 Check in on Cleopatra?
4736274 4738402 I'd stop my son<br />from enlisting.
4741571 4743281 Did he sign up to please you?
4744366 4746576 No, he signed up<br />to piss me off.
4750247 4751748 How would you<br />have stopped him?
4756628 4758463 I'd tell him<br />he was gonna die.
4765512 4767389 I'd tell him<br />that his mother would...
4770016 4771852 find no end to her grief.
4773687 4775439 And that his father<br />would be...
4778275 4780193 helpless to console her.
4783488 4785991 And that the loss would put<br />an end to their marriage.
4800005 4801214 You're still wearing the ring.
4823904 4825322 Promising.
4834039 4835457 More promising.
4841254 4842339 Hello.
4844549 4846551 Get your gear on.<br />They're waiting.
4851181 4852265 Hey.
4853266 4854267 Come here.
4855101 4856478 Okay.
4856561 4857562 I'm gonna show you something.
4857646 4860649 Gosh, this looks important.
4862817 4863818 Around the rope...
4863902 4866029 Now, we are going deep.
4866196 4869032 Descend fast, and breathe<br />through these hoses.
4869199 4870242 Okay?
4870325 4872035 Ah, stay separate.
4872202 4874162 No crisscross. All right?
4874329 4875497 We cannot stay long.
4875664 4879000 I have a method that<br />usually prevents the bends.
4880001 4881127 - Usually?<br />- Yeah.
4881211 4882420 I call it the bounce.
4882587 4883588 You know, fast down,
4883755 4885674 three minutes on the bottom,<br />and then up.
4885840 4886883 Three minutes!
4887050 4888885 No one more second.
4889553 4891805 - Three minutes.<br />- Yeah, that's right.
4891972 4893807 - Where is my lighter?<br />- I don't know, capitán.
4894182 4895976 We have to go.
4898311 4899771 Quick question.
4899938 4901273 What's that?
4901439 4902816 - They're sharks?<br />- No.
4902899 4905277 No, no. No sharks here. Eels.
4906361 4908655 - Eels?<br />- Anguilas.
4908738 4909739 Most are small.
4909906 4911491 Sometimes they are big.<br />Two meters.
4911658 4913702 But if you see them,<br />stay still.
4913868 4917080 They bite you,<br />they lock the jaw. Yeah.
4917247 4918665 They look like snakes.
4919374 4920375 No, they don't.
4920458 4922627 Private Brandy<br />reporting for duty.
4923128 4924129 You're not coming, Teddy?
4924879 4926006 I can't swim.
4926172 4927299 Lucky him.
4927465 4928758 Everyone can swim.
4930635 4932512 Reach and pull.<br />Reach and pull.
4934556 4935640 All right.<br />You stay here
4935724 4937017 with Hector<br />and watch our lines.
4940020 4941938 It is time, camarada.
5050296 5051297 Two minutes?
5184556 5185557 Hey.
5217422 5218423 Hurry up!
5233479 5234981 Helena!
5243740 5244741 Come on.
5244908 5246451 That's it. That's it.<br />That's it.
5247285 5248494 That's it.
5271851 5273019 Who are these people?
5275271 5276272 Nazis.
5276356 5278816 First, you return my Dial,<br />Dr. Jones,
5278983 5282111 and now,<br />you bring me the Grafikos.
5283029 5285198 I'm very happy you're not<br />wasting in retirement.
5285573 5287951 I should have retired you<br />when I had the chance.
5288117 5289243 Where are your sponsors?
5289410 5290995 I'm on my own now.
5291162 5292830 Things move forward,<br />Dr. Jones.
5292914 5293915 And sometimes...
5295792 5297585 they go backward.
5300838 5303091 Now, let's get comfortable<br />and have a little talk.
5330159 5331536 What language is that?
5331703 5333287 It's not a language.
5334539 5335623 It's a code.
5336457 5337458 Polybius.
5338292 5339585 You owe me 50 quid.
5341921 5343715 Not familiar<br />with Polybius cipher?
5343881 5344882 No.
5345633 5347051 But it appears you are.
5351431 5352640 Read it, please.
5360773 5361774 No.
5367530 5368531 Indy...
5379625 5380918 Feeling helpful now?
5384172 5385173 I am.
5388342 5389594 I know this stuff backwards.
5389761 5390845 No!
5392430 5393431 Sorry, Indy.
5393848 5395224 I don't do noble death.
5395892 5396976 Just
5397143 5398561 cold, hard maths.
5399103 5400938 I crack the code,<br />help you find the other half.
5402356 5403983 One hundred grand. Cash.
5404067 5405151 Helena...
5405818 5406819 Take it or leave it.
5408321 5409363 You have a deal.
5422960 5424670 He'll never pay you.
5426214 5427548 I think<br />you will find this is worth
5427632 5429092 more than your asking price.
5438601 5440103 - Teddy.<br />- Helena,
5440269 5441437 don't do this.
5446859 5448277 Let's see what we've got here.
5450446 5451823 My Makhana...
5452323 5453324 that's machine...
5454575 5458121 lies with me,<br />in the city I left.
5458287 5460665 Where wolves<br />teach men to walk.
5460832 5464961 Under one of nine, I lie.
5467797 5469507 Only one thing<br />lies anywhere forever.
5469674 5472385 The dead. So, if the Dial lies<br />with him, then...
5474262 5475763 then this is directions<br />to his tomb.
5476264 5477598 The Tomb of Archimedes?
5479016 5480810 Undiscovered<br />for two millennia.
5483896 5485982 The city I left.
5486607 5488651 Archimedes lived two places<br />his entire life,
5488734 5490069 so he only left one.
5490945 5492947 Anyone? At the back?
5493823 5495366 Come on, Indy.<br />Everyone knows this.
5495533 5497368 - Even this clown.<br />- Alexandria.
5498035 5499871 Full marks.
5500329 5502498 Now, wolf<br />in Greek is lycos.
5502582 5504917 Root of the word<br />lycaeum or school.
5505084 5507712 And the Doric<br />for walking is...
5508963 5509964 peripatio.
5511257 5514010 Which also happens to be<br />the word for...
5519265 5521225 I thought you were<br />a bright spark.
5523811 5526939 Peripatio means walking,
5527106 5529525 but it also means counting.
5529692 5532820 So, where wolves<br />teach men to walk
5533571 5535865 - could be...<br />- The School of Mathematics.
5537200 5538784 Is correct.
5538951 5540494 Now, the next bit is easy.
5541787 5543372 Beneath one of nine?
5544540 5545875 There are nine Muses.
5546042 5547168 The Museon.
5547335 5549795 The Greek word for the<br />Great Library of Alexandria.
5549879 5551005 Which, as we all know,
5551088 5553758 has nine statues<br />supporting its roof.
5553925 5554926 May I?
5556093 5557220 Thank you.
5558387 5561140 The nine Muses,<br />in reverse order,
5562600 5564101 are Calliope,
5564852 5565853 Urania,
5567438 5568481 Polymnia,
5569440 5570983 - Erato...<br />- Polymnia.
5571192 5573569 And Meli whasisname,
5573945 5574946 that other one,
5575696 5576697 Thalia,
5577448 5578658 Euteroe,
5578824 5580910 but the first is...
5581160 5582161 Clio.
5583996 5585164 The Muse of history and time.
5585331 5586540 That Archimedes,
5586707 5587959 - what a clever bugger.<br />- The entrance
5588042 5590169 to the tomb is by<br />the School of Mathematics,
5590336 5592046 under a statue of Clio,
5592213 5594966 in the ruins of the Great<br />Library of Alexandria.
5595132 5596425 Gold star for Dr. Brains.
5597802 5598803 Teddy!
5608729 5610314 The Grafikos, get it!
5637967 5640678 I have said it before,<br />and I will say it again!
5640845 5643472 When you're<br />in a tight spot, dynamite.
5645224 5646767 My friend was just murdered.
5652273 5653274 Sorry.
5653441 5655192 You told them everything.
5656902 5657987 Word for word.
5658612 5660531 But Archimedes<br />didn't make it that easy.
5661324 5663242 The tomb isn't in Alexandria.
5672293 5673294 Go!
5676756 5677757 So, what do you see?
5678424 5680217 Polybius square.
5680760 5681886 Made of?
5684430 5685639 Wax and wood.
5687266 5688517 Anything else?
5691979 5692980 It's heavy.
5696025 5697151 Too heavy.
5699278 5700404 Give me that.
5740611 5742321 This is solid gold?
5742488 5743697 Ancient gold.
5745199 5746200 From the Nile.
5747868 5748869 Hold it, Teddy.
5760381 5761465 Sell this thing
5761632 5763300 and we are out of the hole<br />and then some.
5763384 5764385 I have just the customer.
5764552 5765928 Cranky, old Duchess<br />in Gibraltar...
5766011 5767972 This is going in a museum.
5770850 5772143 Take the wheel, Teddy.
5779024 5780025 What does it say?
5782153 5785030 Search where Dionysius
5785823 5788576 hears each whisper
5789410 5791454 like a hurricane.
5794290 5795708 The Ear.
5796417 5798210 The cave of Dionysius.
5799044 5800045 Where is that?
5801505 5802548 In Sicily.
5804049 5806135 - How much fuel have we got?<br />- It's full.
5815144 5816145 They're heading west.
5817521 5818522 Not east.
5847468 5849595 - I want the papaya.<br />- How much is it?
5853057 5854058 Take this.
5856810 5858979 Look at that kid<br />with the straw hat.
5859271 5861065 This way.
5864652 5865653 Hey.
5866695 5869156 What do you think?
5874954 5876205 What are we doing?
5877831 5879500 Waiting for closing time<br />at the caves.
5879667 5881168 It's crawling with tourists.
5881335 5883754 Okay, so he's, like,<br />running the show now?
5885130 5886549 He's not running<br />the show, Teddy.
5887925 5891053 I just thought we were in this<br />for all the wrong reasons.
5891637 5892805 We are.
5896267 5897268 Most assuredly.
5897351 5900104 You know he's never gonna<br />let us sell any of that stuff.
5901647 5903274 I'm still in charge, Teddy.
5903357 5904400 Helena, get over here!
5904483 5905484 Give me a hand!
5911407 5912533 Oh, you splurged.
5913867 5914910 Here's your backpack.
5914994 5916036 Where's the kid?
5929967 5931552 Hey, watch it!
5931635 5932886 What's wrong with you?
5961415 5962583 Hello.
5964001 5965002 Hey.
5967755 5969006 Let me go!
5970299 5971342 Let me go!
5979141 5981894 Get off me! Let me go!
5985022 5986231 Hey, hey, hey!
5997076 5998160 Helena!
5999536 6000954 They've got Teddy.
6003082 6004667 They took him<br />up the hill somewhere.
6013550 6015552 Hey. Hey! Hey!
6024770 6025854 What are they<br />gonna do to him?
6026021 6028691 He knows about the Ear,<br />what the Grafikos says.
6030067 6031527 They're not gonna hurt him.
6031694 6032861 They're gonna use him
6033612 6035864 to get the other half<br />of the Dial.
6035948 6036990 We gotta get there first.
6050170 6054216 Colonizing queens<br />built many cities in Sicily.
6054383 6055884 - The temple...<br />- Let's go.
6056552 6059096 Is the oldest<br />of the Greek temples.
6060180 6061557 The cave's over there.
6071942 6073694 Could we go<br />a little faster, please?
6082911 6084371 The Ear of Dionysius.
6107311 6109021 Search where Dionysius hears
6109104 6110814 each whisper<br />like a hurricane.
6112024 6113025 That's some echo.
6114777 6117362 Keep making noise till we<br />find out where it's loudest.
6134797 6135964 Stop.
6143555 6144681 This is it.
6149645 6151146 Greek pediment.
6151814 6152815 An entrance.
6154233 6155234 Used to be.
6158529 6159530 A crescent.
6162407 6163492 Just like on the Grafikos.
6171083 6172918 I think there's<br />an opening up there.
6179550 6180551 You okay up there?
6181718 6182886 Yes.
6185389 6186431 You're not moving.
6188934 6190143 I'm thinking.
6192980 6193981 About?
6195148 6198068 About what the hell I'm doing<br />up here, 40 feet in the air,
6198402 6199987 with crap shoulders,
6200153 6201947 crumbling vertebrae,
6202114 6204616 a plate in one leg,<br />screws in the other.
6204783 6206034 Yeah, I get it. I get it.
6206660 6207786 No, you don't get it.
6208620 6209830 You're half my age.
6210873 6213542 You haven't been forced<br />to drink the blood of Kali.
6213709 6214960 No. Fair enough.
6215794 6217546 Or been tortured with voodoo.
6218922 6219923 And I'm just guessing,
6220007 6221675 but I don't think<br />you've been shot nine times,
6221842 6224303 including once by your father.
6226054 6227389 Dad shot you?
6228098 6229266 Don't talk to me.
6229433 6230601 Just go ahead.<br />I'll follow you.
6239359 6241945 No, no, no. We are close.<br />We are close.
6242112 6243113 Look around you.
6243280 6244781 - We are close.<br />- The Cave of Dionysius.
6244948 6247826 No, no, no. The cave<br />is closed for renovation.
6249912 6250954 Let me ask again.
6251038 6252956 Where is<br />the Cave of Dionysius?
6272601 6274770 What's the matter?<br />You worried about the kid?
6276063 6277731 Are you sure<br />they won't hurt him?
6277898 6279107 He'll be fine.
6279274 6280317 He's smart.
6282194 6283570 Where'd you find him?
6284363 6287407 He... He tried to steal<br />my purse outside a casino
6287491 6289952 in Marrakesh when he was 10.
6290118 6291954 I hit him repeatedly<br />with my car door,
6292120 6294623 but he didn't let go<br />and neither did I.
6294790 6296333 So, been together ever since.
6297459 6299419 Thought you were<br />all about the money.
6300545 6301546 I am.
6304633 6306468 Nobody memorizes every page
6306551 6308679 of their<br />dead father's notebooks
6308845 6309930 for the money.
6316561 6318021 Herr Voller!
6328198 6329574 They went that way.
6339918 6341670 Why?
6344881 6346717 Come on, come on.
6348593 6350387 Let's go.
6355100 6356101 Oh, my...
6359146 6360647 Oh, my God!
6361481 6362816 Oh, my God!
6363025 6364401 - Oh, God!<br />- No, no.
6365318 6366695 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
6371241 6372868 Are they off me? Get 'em off!
6372951 6374619 - No, no. Wait.<br />- Get 'em off!
6387674 6388759 What is that?
6391720 6393221 Methane.
6394264 6395474 Don't breathe.
6395640 6396641 Don't breathe?
6400353 6401730 We've gotta get outta here.
6410572 6411573 Athena.
6413325 6414618 Goddess of war.
6417496 6418705 And reason.
6423001 6424377 Under the moon...
6426671 6428673 life lies at her feet.
6436431 6437766 Water displacement.
6438558 6439893 Get in the pool!
6440060 6442062 Why?<br />Help me open the door.
6442229 6443855 Well, they didn't<br />get out the doors!
6443939 6444940 Get in the pool!
6445982 6447859 Okay, I'm getting in the pool.
6448026 6449152 Help me.
6451571 6453907 Archimedes was fascinated
6455408 6457369 by water displacement!
6498368 6500662 Hey! Get back here! Klaber!
6514885 6516052 You don't need to do that.
6542120 6543163 Hey!
6544539 6546291 Give me that!
6547083 6548793 No!
6555342 6556635 Leave them.
6557344 6558970 I said leave them.
6583411 6584955 Reach and pull.
6585121 6586706 Reach and pull.
6586873 6589042 Reach and pull.
6617487 6619030 Archimedes' tomb.
6647976 6649269 Grab that corner.
6695607 6696608 Indy.
6698902 6700278 This frieze...
6702947 6704199 It's a phoenix.
6704366 6705367 A common icon.
6705533 6707118 No. Look, it isn't.
6708703 6710413 This phoenix has propellers.
6719297 6720757 What's this doing here?
6729557 6732560 Clocks won't be invented<br />for 1,000 years,
6733228 6734687 much less watches.
6737232 6738441 Archimedes used it.
6741986 6743363 Dad was right.
6744030 6745031 It works.
6745115 6746741 Of course it works,<br />Miss Shaw.
6749452 6750703 Mathematics works.
6751830 6754833 As it conquered space,<br />it will conquer time.
6762715 6764634 You've already<br />lost your son, Dr. Jones.
6764801 6765802 Your wife is gone.
6765885 6767804 Do you really<br />want to lose your godchild?
6770890 6771975 For what?
6772392 6774561 A world that no longer cares<br />about men like us.
6785905 6786906 Thank you.
6825612 6826988 History's greatest moment.
6834078 6835371 Its end.
6843046 6844047 Throw me the gun!
6854432 6856684 - Get him outta here.<br />- Teddy.
6857727 6858853 Teddy! Teddy!
6859020 6860063 Come on! Go!
6860146 6861147 This way. Come on.
6865235 6866778 Go!
6870365 6871366 Indy!
6873368 6874536 Go!
6874702 6875954 Go!
6876120 6877205 Stop!
6880583 6882001 Now what?
6883628 6884629 Bring him.
6892720 6893721 Helena, come on!
6893888 6895181 Teddy, we can't<br />just leave him.
6895265 6896599 We're not! Follow me!
6898560 6899561 Come on!
6903481 6904566 Come on.
6918746 6920707 Teddy. Come on.<br />We've got a car.
6925169 6926588 Ah, crap.
6932802 6933845 Stay there.
6952739 6953740 Hop on.
6957368 6960288 The first hemisphere<br />sets the destination.
6961789 6965376 The second calculates<br />the location of the fissure
6966628 6968463 in Alexandrine coordinates.
6969047 6971924 Have Messner transpose this<br />to longitude and latitude,
6972967 6974844 and transmit waypoints<br />to the pilots.
6986981 6988483 Shortcut.
6992779 6995740 You got coordinates for 37.07.
6995823 6997158 So, who is it?
6997909 6999160 Churchill?
7000495 7001496 Ike?
7003831 7006334 Who are you gonna kill<br />to win the war?
7007168 7010046 In a few minutes,<br />with the help of Archimedes,
7010213 7012090 we shall fly<br />into the eye of this storm
7012882 7015134 and cross into<br />Sicilian airspace
7015301 7018805 on August 20th, 1939.
7019555 7021391 We will head north<br />over friendly skies
7021474 7023101 with enough fuel<br />to reach Munich.
7024394 7026020 My quarry<br />will be waiting for me
7026562 7029023 at 16 Prinzregentenplatz
7029399 7031609 for an update<br />on his V-1 rocket.
7038616 7042578 What kind of Nazi<br />kills the Führer?
7044205 7046874 The kind that believes<br />in victory, Dr. Jones.
7052130 7055967 Hitler lit a fire that could<br />have burned 1,000 years.
7056134 7057635 I saw every mistake.
7058428 7059721 Every blunder.
7059887 7061556 And I will correct them all.
7061723 7064350 History is a long list<br />of losses, Dr. Jones.
7065393 7066644 It's just a question of whose.
7079323 7080616 Stop!
7153314 7154315 Teddy.
7156150 7157151 You think you can fly<br />one of those?
7159153 7160154 A Nord?
7162865 7163866 Sure.
7164617 7165743 It's not a ringing response.
7165910 7167537 Well, I haven't flown a Nord.
7167703 7169247 You've never flown any plane.
7170456 7172250 I'll get it started.
7172416 7173668 No, Teddy.
7174836 7175837 Crap.
7203239 7204824 Fasten your seat belt,<br />Dr. Jones.
7204991 7206284 There might be<br />some turbulence.
7207535 7209745 You're German, Voller.
7209912 7211914 Don't try and be funny.
7235313 7237148 Come on, big talker.
7251579 7252955 Okay.
7269805 7271390 Okay. Okay.
7271557 7274101 Gauges green. Power full.
7274769 7277271 And when I reach 85, I rotate.
7315017 7316435 Okay, wings down.
7318521 7320523 Okay, 84 miles an hour.
7320982 7322066 Rotate.
7389842 7391177 Time to destination?
7392386 7393929 60 seconds.
7399268 7400728 Continental drift.
7404148 7405357 Continental drift!
7407109 7409695 Archimedes didn't know<br />about continental drift.
7410529 7412698 He couldn't have!
7412782 7414700 It hadn't been observed yet.
7415701 7417495 You're off target.
7417953 7419830 Your coordinates<br />are based on markers
7420581 7423793 that have been moving<br />for 2,000 years!
7423959 7426796 You could be off<br />by 10 degrees, by...
7442353 7443938 30 seconds.
7445106 7446107 Herr Voller...
7446190 7448234 Your calculations are wrong!
7449485 7451237 - Herr Voller...<br />- Will you shut up?
7451320 7452321 I'm thinking!
7455282 7456200 20 seconds.
7458994 7460079 Hold the flight path!
7462081 7463374 15 seconds.
7466919 7468963 I don't know<br />where we're going, Jürgen.
7469046 7470047 10 seconds.
7470172 7471132 9!
7471215 7472758 But it sure as hell...
7473175 7474635 - 7!<br />- Ain't 1939!
7474802 7475427 6!
7475594 7476387 Turn around!
7477721 7478597 Abort!
7478931 7479682 Turn around!
7480641 7481308 Abort!
7481767 7483727 We're being pulled in!
7493737 7495072 What are you doing?!
7495281 7496115 This is my plane!
7496448 7497783 You're flying my plane!
7522600 7523767 We're going to die!
7525102 7526812 We need to pull up!
7548667 7549835 Restart engines!
7578530 7579698 That's Sicily.
7579782 7580991 1939.
7582743 7584161 I did it.
7584328 7585829 I did it, Dr. Jones!
7585996 7587706 Setting coordinates for Munich.
7594672 7596715 Yesterday belongs to us,<br />Dr. Jones.
7621615 7623784 Those are Roman triremes.
7652021 7653230 Keep it in the air!
7673500 7674084 Master...
7674335 7676754 The Romans are getting closer.
7678505 7679381 They have dragons!
7684553 7685929 Amazing.
7694897 7695898 Open the door!
7700861 7701862 What are you doing?
7702821 7704531 What are you doing,<br />you idiots?
7704698 7706492 They think we're a monster!
7712956 7714458 You have to turn around.
7714625 7716543 This is the Siege of Syracuse.
7717669 7719004 214 BC.
7719171 7720381 You got the wrong war.
7724134 7724843 Master...
7728389 7729640 Don't ride out there, Master!
7730224 7731433 The dragons!!
7741693 7745197 We must take down their dragons!
7752204 7753288 Boss!
7753372 7754206 Change course!
7754456 7755833 The portal closes in minutes!
7756250 7757167 I have to go back!
7757626 7758752 I can't be here!
7758961 7760045 I can't stay here!
7760212 7761672 The plane won't make it!
7791368 7792369 Get out of the way!
7798709 7800836 How do you like that,<br />you savages?
7803881 7806633 Sorry, pal, but you're a Nazi!
7816685 7818770 What are you doing here?
7818937 7820481 Rescuing you!
7831116 7832910 Get him off!
7834286 7835370 Indy!
7841001 7842211 Parachute!
7845005 7846173 I got a parachute!
7847674 7849092 Hang on!
7852095 7853180 Let go!
7855516 7856892 Give me the parachute!
7862981 7865108 Grab it. Hang on!
7866652 7868403 Indy!
7895764 7897224 We're losing altitude!
7898475 7899393 We're going down!
7901311 7902896 I've lost control!
7921123 7923584 Hey, those are my friends.
7923750 7925794 Those are my friends.<br />We need to help them!
7926962 7928547 Those are my friends!
7990442 7991818 Eureka.
8009002 8010003 He's trying to land.
8010087 8012047 Come on, Indy. Help me.
8012798 8014841 Get up. Yeah.
8015008 8017302 We need to get you<br />out of here. Okay.
8019221 8020514 Help me. Sit up, okay?
8021390 8022641 Sit up. You need to help me.
8022808 8024685 I know it hurts,<br />but we gotta get you back.
8024851 8027562 This is incredible, Wombat.
8028105 8030065 Incredible.
8031608 8033318 Yeah, it very well is.
8033485 8035070 But we have to<br />get you out of here.
8037197 8038323 My God.
8039991 8041868 We're witnessing history.
8048959 8050752 Reverse these numbers.
8050919 8052003 They'll get you home.
8053672 8054673 What?
8057592 8058802 I'm going to stay.
8059553 8061555 No. You're not serious.
8064391 8065434 Wow, you are serious.
8069521 8071148 Indy, you've been shot.
8071231 8072232 You're bleeding.
8072607 8074151 You can't stay here.
8074234 8075235 Yes, I can.
8075902 8076945 But for what? For...
8077028 8080574 For a long, painful death<br />with poultice and leeches?
8081616 8083744 I've imagined this, Wombat.
8084828 8086663 Studied it.
8086830 8088874 - All my life.<br />- Yeah.
8089040 8092043 And if you stay here,<br />you will muck it all up.
8092127 8093128 And die.
8093879 8095505 Please, get up.
8097257 8098425 Helena!
8098759 8099760 I did it!
8099926 8102262 Bravo, Teddy! Three cheers!
8102429 8104055 Okay. Indy, we've gotta go.<br />Get up.
8104139 8105599 I need to get you<br />into that plane, okay?
8105682 8106683 - We need to.<br />- No. No.
8106850 8109186 Get up. You can... We can!
8121656 8122282 Master!
8125160 8126953 We have to leave, Master.
8128580 8129581 It's him.
8138548 8140592 He's asking<br />how far we've come.
8144012 8146765 Two thousand years.
8147390 8148558 We've come...
8149142 8152145 two thousand years.
8154481 8157609 But we didn't expect to meet...
8158151 8160654 the great...
8161196 8163240 Archimedes.
8168912 8169830 You...
8171039 8172374 were always...
8173041 8174292 going to...
8174876 8176461 meet me.
8177212 8179047 That dial<br />is a forced deck.
8179130 8180590 It doesn't take us<br />anywhere but here.
8180757 8182050 He built it to get help.
8182217 8184761 Well, we just scared off<br />the entire Roman Navy,
8184845 8185846 so I think<br />we've helped enough.
8186054 8187681 Apologies, Archimedes.
8187889 8189224 I'm a fan...
8189474 8192185 - but we need to leave. He's hurt.<br />- Helena...
8192811 8193812 He can't keep that,<br />by the way.
8193895 8194896 He needs to build his own one.
8194980 8196648 Helena, we need to go!
8197107 8199234 Indy, the window is closing!
8199401 8200527 We cannot get stuck here!
8202028 8202654 I want...
8202863 8203947 to stay...
8204322 8206074 with you.
8206241 8208201 No, no, no!<br />Do not say yes!
8208785 8211037 You are a brilliant man...
8211288 8213290 a wise man...
8213832 8215083 a genius...
8215166 8216167 Helena...
8216334 8218670 a hero to your people.
8219379 8222924 But he can't help you.
8224092 8225260 This is your time.
8225343 8226678 This is your time.
8226761 8228722 He must be in his own time...
8228805 8230056 He needs to be in his.
8230140 8232434 His work is not done.<br />He needs to go home.
8232517 8234185 There is medicine at home.
8234269 8236146 He cannot die here. He can't.
8237814 8240650 Helena, get on the plane.
8243236 8244321 I'll be all right.
8246156 8247490 No, you won't.
8250452 8252203 I need to do this.
8253288 8254289 Me too.
8308802 8309803 Good morning.
8314683 8316059 How's the shoulder?
8318728 8321231 Better than my jaw.
8324859 8325860 Right.
8327862 8329364 You should've let me stay.
8330240 8331449 I couldn't do that.
8340458 8341459 Why not?
8343336 8345880 Well, for starters, you'd have<br />changed the course of history.
8350218 8352012 That's supposed to be<br />a bad thing?
8356141 8357934 You're meant to be here, Indy.
8361730 8362731 Here.
8367861 8368987 For who?
8396306 8397891 Marion.
8399142 8400185 Hey.
8419454 8420455 Teddy.
8422082 8423083 Marion.
8425794 8426795 What are you doing?
8428338 8429506 Putting groceries away.
8431800 8434511 There wasn't a scrap of food<br />in this place.
8435428 8437430 No. Really.
8442227 8444437 Someone told me you were back.
8451903 8453530 Are you back, Indy?
8455156 8456866 It was explosives,
8457033 8459160 and Indy was running,<br />Marion was running,
8459327 8461996 and suddenly<br />the plane exploded.
8465708 8467752 Indy, you're up and about.
8468962 8470338 Yes, I am.
8471464 8472465 Yes.
8473091 8475135 Why don't we go<br />and get some ice cream, kids?
8475301 8476636 But Marion<br />just bought some.
8476719 8477804 Oh, I know a better place.
8477971 8480181 You can never have too much<br />ice cream, can you?
8483893 8484894 See you later.
8488481 8491401 <i>A British tar is a soaring soul</i>
8491568 8494404 <i>As free as a mountain bird</i>
8494571 8496406 <i>His energetic fist</i>
8496573 8498992 <i>Should be ready to resist...</i>
8500869 8502162 That looks bad.
8503663 8504914 Does it hurt?
8507458 8508918 Everything hurts.
8511796 8513423 I know how that feels.
8519512 8522140 Well, where doesn't it hurt?
8530732 8531733 Here.
8532525 8533776 It doesn't hurt here.
8542035 8543578 And here.
8567185 8569562 Jabari, Alia, slow down!
8569729 8571856 Helena! Hurry up!
8572023 8574692 I scream, you scream...
8574859 8576986 Everybody, slow down.
8577153 8579155 - I scream, you scream...<br />- I scream, I scream...
8579322 8581032 We all scream for ice cream!
8581199 8583284 Slow down.
