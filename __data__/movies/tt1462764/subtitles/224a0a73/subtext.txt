2100302 2102805 There were irregularities<br />in their rotations.

4328361 4330363 Ah! It isn't in a language.<br />It's in a code.
4330530 4331740 What code?
4331907 4333366 Archimedes used two codes.
4333533 4335076 Linear B and Polybius Square.

4524099 4525266 He told him

5488896 5490981 "The city I left."
5491607 5493651 Archimedes lived two places<br />his entire life,
5493734 5495069 so he only left one.

5546787 5548372 "Beneath one of nine"?
5549540 5550874 There are nine Muses.
5551041 5552167 The <i>Museon.</i>
5552334 5554795 The Greek word for the<br />Great Library of Alexandria.
5554878 5556004 Which, as we all know,
