45836 46921 On your feet!
68025 69235 An American, Colonel.
69527 71529 He was at the gate,<br />impersonating an officer.

130588 131589 Doctor.
139597 141599 The Lance of Longinus.
143142 145436 The blade that drew Christ's blood.
146312 147563 The Holy Lance.

202827 204954 Tell us your story, or die.
205746 207081 Story. Erm...
207957 209792 Okay, okay.
209959 211711 Well...
211794 213254 it all started
213963 218008 once upon a time,<br />when this village
218092 222722 of stupid blue-eyed boys<br />decided to join hands together
222805 224890 and follow this sweaty<br />little pied piper
224974 226726 named Adolf...
325908 327993 This man<br />was with the American.
329745 330830 This is the American's bag.
332706 333666 What have | done?
338254 339588 Bring him to my carriage.
347471 350266 Careful.<br />This is the Fuhrer's special relic!
368200 369535 Heil Hitler!
379837 381130 Stay seated.
382006 383340 So...
386218 388137 you are a birdwatcher?
391807 393684 Yes. Because of the bombing,
393976 396604 the wagtails are following<br />a completely different trajectory.
400566 402276 We caught your accomplice.
403485 404987 The American.
470928 472179 Oh, my!
497788 498998 Get off of me!
527276 528485 There's one reason
528569 530070 you're still alive,<br />birdwatcher.
532614 534158 Who sent you?
534324 535492 What was your mission?
535659 537661 Please, Colonel, no.<br />| beg you.
537828 540122 My name is Basil Shaw.
541373 543333 I'm a professor at Oxford.
543417 544835 An archaeologist.
552342 553427 There you are.
557598 559558 There is a problem.
560726 562019 I must speak to the Colonel.
562519 563520 It's urgent.
566607 568567 | have a daughter. | beg you.
569234 571945 | guarantee you will never see<br />your child again, Mr Shaw.
573989 578243 Unless you explain<br />why your accomplice had this.
587544 588796 Sieg heil!
600808 603018 We were fold<br />that the Lance of Longinus
603102 604937 could be found<br />at the fortress.
605854 607272 We were looking for it.
607773 608774 Why?
610359 611360 Because of its power?
612528 615197 It has no power.
617866 620494 My friend and |<br />were trying to save history.
623122 624581 | must<br />speak with the Colonel.
625874 626917 It's about the Lance.
673672 675048 | only had a moment to look at it.
675257 676967 Of course, my training is in physics,
677467 679428 For God's sake, spit it out!
681513 682222 The Lance...
684933 686643 It's a fake.
687269 688061 It's a fake.
688520 689646 A fake?
691899 693442 The blade is an alloy.
693609 694943 Fifty years old,
695152 697279 the engravings recent. It's a replica.
697487 698488 We're dead.

702326 703535 Thirteenth century.
704286 705829 Ramesses II.
707247 708957 None of this stuff is fake.
711793 713378 | gotta stop this train.
713712 715047 There is another relic on this train.
716215 717633 One with real power.
718091 719218 What are you talking about?
721261 722179 The Antikythera.
722888 723555 The Antikythera?!
723805 725807 Enough about that old dial!
726058 728227 Colonel, the Fuhrer<br />has lost the war...
728644 730020 and his mind!
732356 733565 Let me explain.
735567 738028 The Antikythera's power<br />is not supernatural.
738487 740364 It is mathematics.
742074 743575 Whoever harnesses it...
745661 747162 will not be King...
747913 748914 nor Emperor...
750290 751500 or Fuhrer.
755003 756797 He will be God.

775315 776858 Too many Nazis.
780696 783323 And how do you propose<br />we tell him this?
783991 784700 My Fuhrer,
785367 787411 I'm sorry the Lance of Christ is fake.
787661 788829 But here is...
790247 793000 half of something you've never heard of.
794543 795502 Tell me,
795961 797462 have you ever MET HITLER?!!
800048 801133 A saboteur aboard.
801341 802634 And Hitler's Lance is gone.

1463169 1467131 by this complex<br />blue-line pattern.
1467298 1468299 Okay?

1484524 1485733 Okay.
1486943 1488945 Guess I'll spoon-feed it<br />to you.
1491823 1494450 In 213 BC,
1494617 1496619 Roman forces led by Marcellus
1496786 1499622 laid siege<br />to the city of Syracuse.
1499789 1501457 "Syracuse."
1502917 1505503 Not the Syracuse<br />in New York, Tonya.
1505670 1507255 The one in Sicily.
1508047 1510425 Amongst the defenders<br />of the city
1510591 1513678 was its most famous resident,<br />who was...

1523479 1524605 A mathematician.
1524772 1525940 A mathematician.
1526107 1528693 But more than that,<br />an inventor,
1528860 1531362 a brilliant engineer
1531529 1532947 who conceived of a way
1533031 1535825 to harness the energy<br />of the Mediterranean sun
1535908 1538745 on concave mirrors<br />and focus it
1538911 1541581 on attacking Roman warships<br />and set them on fire.
1541748 1545209 Who devised giant iron claws
1545376 1547962 that could snatch hostiles<br />from the sea.
1550548 1553426 But how do we know<br />it really happened?
1554552 1558556 What physical, irrefutable<br />archaeological evidence
1558723 1562060 -is there of these inventions?<br />-The Antikythera.
1563436 1565605 -The Antikythera.<br />-For starters.

1586584 1588669 - Surprise.<br />- Surprise!

1655653 1657446 Neil, Buzz, and Mike...
1657613 1660366 If they knew<br />we walked on the moon?
1660533 1662076 Speaking as an ancient,
1662243 1664704 going to the moon<br />is like going to Reno.
1664871 1666164 Middle of nowhere
1667373 1668833 and no blackjack.

1831370 1832371 In archaeology.
1833331 1835458 Archaeology. Wow.
1835624 1837168 Apple didn't fall far.
1837335 1840046 Well, now I'm researching<br />a doctorate.
1841255 1842256 What's your subject?
1843049 1845051 The Archimedes Dial.
1845718 1847136 The Antikythera.
1850097 1851432 What do you know about that?
1851974 1853309 Well, for starters,
1853476 1856854 in 1902, Greek sponge divers<br />found a wrecked Roman warship,
1857021 1858397 huge, off the coast of Greece.
1859023 1860733 Below deck, sealed in wax,
1860900 1862443 was a clock-like mechanism,
1862610 1865404 finely tooled,<br />purpose unknown.
1865571 1867448 Nothing approximating<br />its complexity
1867531 1869533 appears in the world<br />for 1,000 years.
1870701 1872828 -You've done your homework.<br />-Well, not me.
1872995 1874413 Dad. He had<br />all these journals,
1874497 1875998 reams of notes about it.
1876165 1878000 He was obsessed till the end.
1881670 1883839 He told me you found it<br />on a Nazi plunder train.
1885299 1888386 And then lost it in a river<br />in the French Alps.
1890429 1892348 Hmm. Well, that was a long time ago.
1892515 1893974 And it was only half the Dial.
1894058 1895184 -Archimedes...<br />-Archimedes broke the Dial...
1895267 1896811 -...disassembled it.<br />-...in two, and then hid
1896977 1898979 the two halves from the Romans<br />during the siege of Syracuse.
1899146 1900356 | know. Look.
1901440 1903317 You don't remember the last<br />time | saw you, do you?
1904985 1906112 Remember what?
1906195 1907196 These are the Alps.
1908656 1910241 Yeah, | see.
1910408 1912159 And this is the route<br />that your train took
1912243 1913285 from the Nazi stronghold
1913369 1914370 -in '44.<br />-Right.
1914537 1916330 It went through<br />this mountain pass,
1916497 1917998 and then here.
1918165 1920000 Here, it's the only river<br />on the route.
1920084 1921627 -Right.<br />-Under a bridge.
1921794 1923170 It's down there.<br />It's got to be.
1923337 1925756 -And nobody knows except us.<br />-“US“?
1926048 1927550 Well, | mean, you.
1927716 1929260 And me. So, yeah.
1929427 1931262 -Us.<br />-Us.
1932263 1934765 And what were you<br />thinking exactly?
1936225 1937309 Well, that maybe...
1939145 1940688 we could go there.
1940855 1941897 And?
1942064 1943149 And find it. And...
1944066 1945693 And I'd become...
1947319 1948487 famous.
1948654 1950948 Oh, well, not famous.<br />Renowned. Feted.
1951532 1953325 A feted archaeologist.
1953492 1955202 And you, a final triumph!
1955286 1956412 Indiana Jones!
1956495 1958539 Out with a bang!<br />Back in the saddle!
1961584 1963002 I'm not selling this, am 1?
1965504 1966714 Wombat...
1968841 1970676 why are you chasing the thing
1972428 1974513 that drove your father crazy?
1980478 1981896 Wouldn't you?
2000122 2001123 | got it.
2001207 2002208 Parade's comin' soon.
2003250 2004251 So, what we got?
2006003 2008380 She's in there, third floor,<br />with an old guy.
2008547 2009673 Who is he, a Russian?
2009840 2011759 No, a professor.<br />Dr Henry Jones.
2012843 2013844 Klaber!
2014345 2016430 Klaber, get back here!<br />You're not an agent!
2016597 2017890 God damn it! Go.
2018057 2020643 I'll get support up here<br />and pull a file on Jones.
2041288 2042540 This way.
2078701 2081787 Basil became obsessed<br />by this German theory.
2083330 2084707 Conjecture, really.
2087251 2088877 Archimedes had figured out
2088961 2091964 that the movements<br />of the moon and planets
2092840 2094049 weren't perfect.
2095301 2097803 There were irregularities<br />in their rotations.
2098971 2101265 He thought these<br />irregularities might
2101432 2104810 explain fluctuations<br />in temperature, tides.
2106937 2108230 Storms, even.
2109607 2112484 So, he set about building<br />a device to predict them.
2114194 2115988 But then, he stumbled upon
2116071 2118115 a method to predict<br />even larger
2118866 2119867 disturbances.
2121744 2123162 Larger disturbances?
2123787 2125998 Your father<br />thought this thing could
2126707 2128959 predict fissures in time.
2145976 2147478 Hauke, if you don't...
2149897 2152107 Found 'em.
2159657 2160741 Hello.
2161784 2163994 Are you looking for...
2164161 2165329 Dr Jones?
2168999 2170250 Excuse me, can | help you?
2170834 2171835 No, thank you.
2171919 2173629 Just a routine investigation,<br />ma'am.
2174713 2177216 Are you the police?
2177299 2178717 It'll just be a few moments.
2178884 2180594 -Professor Plimpton.<br />-Ma'am.
2180678 2181679 -Professor Plimpton!<br />-Ma'am!
2186392 2187393 Drop your weapon.
2187768 2188769 What the hell are you doin'?
2188852 2189978 Erm...
2190062 2192231 What the doctor tells me,<br />Miss Mason.
2192314 2193315 Mandy?
2197945 2199988 Yeah, no witnesses.
2204368 2206453 Jesus. What the hell?
2206745 2208122 Your father wrote<br />SO many letters
2208205 2210040 about the Dial,<br />| stopped reading 'em.
2213168 2214169 You really don't remember
2214253 2215879 the last time<br />| was at your house?
2217840 2219717 | took that from him then.
2221343 2222928 | thought he'd stopped<br />thinking about it.
2223011 2224012 But your father was convinced
2224096 2227099 this thing was real<br />and dangerous.
2227266 2229226 Do not shoot.
2229643 2233063 He was terrified that if somebody found<br />this legendary tablet,
2233230 2234356 the Grafikos...
2234523 2235524 The tablet<br />containing directions
2235607 2236692 to the rest of the Dial.
2236859 2237985 And if they found<br />the Grafikos,
2238152 2239611 they might acquire<br />the other half of the Dial
2239695 2240696 and put the two together.
2242364 2243574 | knew<br />you wouldn't destroy it.
2247202 2249037 How did you know<br />he asked me to destroy it?
2249913 2251915 -What?<br />-You do remember that night.
2252666 2254585 | was 12 years old, Indy.
2254668 2256086 You knew we didn't drop it<br />in ariver.
2256920 2258839 -Baz didn't tell you that.<br />-See, listen.
2258922 2260174 -1 didn't...<br />-No, he never lied.
2260716 2261967 -No...<br />-What was all that crap
2262050 2263093 -about the map?<br />-You...
2263260 2264303 No, you've had<br />too many whiskeys.
2265179 2266180 What are you doing, Wombat?
2266263 2267598 Stay where you are.
2268807 2269808 Don't move.
2270559 2272060 -Who are these people?<br />-We need to get out of here.
2272144 2273145 Are they with you?
2273228 2274480 Not an inch, Miss Shaw.
2275689 2276690 Miss Shaw, stop!
2280360 2281361 Helena!
2286158 2287159 Stop!
2289119 2290120 Sorry.
2290204 2293165 -Helena!<br />-Dr Jones. It's over.
2293332 2294541 Who are you people?
2294708 2295793 What do you want?
2297628 2298629 Stop!
2300714 2301715 Helena Shaw!
2301799 2303258 She's on the roof.<br />Find another way up.
2303342 2304426 Dr Jones!
2304885 2306261 Dr Jones,<br />we're not gonna hurt you.
2332788 2334081 Move.<br />We gotta follow 'em.
2334164 2335290 Go. Hurry up.
2362860 2363861 Fan out!
2376665 2378166 All right, let's go.<br />Move, move, move! Pack it up!
2378250 2379251 Come on,<br />get everything.
2379418 2380544 Found her!
2408989 2411283 - Operator-<br />-1 need the police.
2411450 2413744 Hunter College.<br />People are dead.
2413827 2414995 - Please...<br />- Hang up, fella.
2420876 2421960 Stand up.
2427424 2428508 Okay, okay.
2452866 2454326 She's gone. You blew it,
2454493 2455744 you trigger-happy cracker.
2455911 2458372 -She had it in her hand.<br />-We got the professor.
2461959 2463126 Here's the file on Jones.
2463210 2464211 Yes.
2482479 2483522 Who are you?
2483689 2485148 That's my question.
2495659 2497119 You're CIA.
2497285 2499037 Oh, not me, man.
2499204 2501164 | don't take government jobs.
2501331 2502416 Okay.
2503709 2505877 How are you acquainted<br />with Miss Shaw?
2506253 2507504 She's my goddaughter.
2508255 2509881 | haven't seen her<br />in 18 years.
2510048 2511133 Why did you<br />meet with her today?
2511216 2512217 To give her the Dial?
2513593 2516054 Lady, it's an ancient<br />hunk of gears.
2517014 2518056 Half a hunk.
2518140 2519808 Oh, it's a lot more than that.
2521560 2522728 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
2522811 2524062 Where do you think<br />you're going?
2524229 2525605 | got a parade going on.
2525772 2527232 And a demonstration<br />coming down here.
2527399 2528442 Hey! Hey, hey!
2529109 2530152 -Hey...<br />-Shut up.
2530318 2532738 | can't go this way.<br />Gotta go back.
2537743 2539494 Hell no!<br />What is wrong with you, man?
2539661 2541288 Damn it! Let's go on foot.
2541455 2542539 You heard her.
2544207 2545292 What the hell<br />were you thinking?
2545375 2546668 - Walk! Come on.<br />- What is your problem?
2546752 2547753 You don't look<br />when you're backin' up?
2547836 2549379 -Take care of that guy.<br />-Who's gonna pay for that?
2549463 2550589 Easy, fella. Easy.
2550672 2551673 Keep movin'.
2551757 2553508 Can't you see my cab?<br />It's yellow.
2553592 2555177 No, you're gonna have to pay<br />for this bodywork, man.
2555260 2556261 | don't...
2558138 2560432 Peace now!<br />Peace now!
2561850 2564686 Stop the war!<br />Stop the fighting!
2564853 2566605 -Where are we going, Mason?<br />-This way.
2568648 2570233 -Hell no, we won't go.<br />-Shut up.

2575947 2578325 -Hell no, we won't go!<br />-Hell no, we won't go!
2578909 2580327 -Hell no...<br />-Shut up!
2580494 2581495 Hell yeah!
2581787 2583663 Hell no, we won't go!

2589211 2591463 Hell no, we won't go!<br />Hell no, we won't go!
2591546 2592547 Hell no...
2592964 2596510 Hell no, we won't go!<br />Hell no, we won't go!
2603475 2604768 Hey!
2605227 2607229 Officer! Help me!
2607979 2609564 Officer,<br />there was a shooting...
2609648 2611483 -All right, all right.<br />-...this morning at Hunter.
2611650 2613401 People are dead. God damn it.
2613485 2615195 Some rogue maniacs<br />broke in and...
2615278 2616905 Sir, you need to calm it down.
2617072 2618281 Please listen to me.
2618448 2620575 There was a shooting<br />this morning, and the...
2620742 2624162 They're in a Con Ed van<br />right around the corner!
2626748 2628375 Hey! What do you think<br />you're doing?
2639469 2640470 Whoa!
2640554 2641888 -Watch out!<br />-What's he doin'?
2641972 2643056 Whoa!
2677632 2678633 Hyah! Hyah!
2691104 2692939 - Move, out the way!<br />- Whoa, whoa!
2694983 2696610 Hyah!
2700280 2701531 - Watch out!<br />- Hyah!
2701907 2703366 Whoa. Whoa.
2703450 2704618 Move! Quickly!
2709956 2711291 Hyah!
2718882 2720300 Move! Move!
2730894 2732229 Go, go, go!
2736733 2737734 Hyah!
2748620 2749829 Hyah!
2752874 2754960 Come on.<br />That's ridiculous.
2755043 2756544 - It's a horse.<br />- Come on.
2759047 2760882 - Hey, mister.<br />- Move! Out of the way!
2761216 2763009 -Hold my horse.<br />-Move! Move!
2763093 2764094 Transfer is available
2764177 2766263 for IND Queens Boulevard.
2775689 2778692 Next stop, 59th,<br />Lexington Avenue.
2780568 2782862 -Subway is faster.<br />-Oh!
2783363 2785115 People tend<br />to romanticise science,
2785198 2787158 when it is, in fact,<br />quite cold.
2787325 2788827 So, what's next,<br />Dr Schmidt?
2789953 2791037 Mars?
2791830 2793248 No, we've conquered space.
2795083 2796793 I'm moving<br />to the next frontier.
2798253 2800672 What's beyond space?
2804301 2806219 You might wanna<br />get that suit pressed,
2806303 2807304 Dr Schmidt.
2807929 2809556 We leave for the airport<br />in an hour.
2809931 2811016 He's gonna meet the President.
2811099 2812684 If the President objects<br />to a few creases,
2812767 2815103 perhaps he should find himself<br />another physicist.
2816104 2817939 - Can | use that?<br />- No.
2818315 2819399 Yes.
2819482 2821526 Baxter.
2825697 2826823 It's for you, Doctor.
2830577 2832704 | may wanna leave a bit later<br />for Los Angeles.
2832787 2835040 I'm expecting<br />a delivery shortly.
2838209 2839210 Speak.
2839294 2840795 Your goons made a mess.
2840962 2842130 Did they?
2842297 2844716 Miss Shaw met<br />with a professor. Jones.
2845342 2847093 She acquired the device<br />from him.
2848011 2849095 Then we lost her.
2850764 2852432 Dr Jones got away as well.
2852849 2854017 /s that so?
2854184 2855518 <i>Most unfortunate.</i>
2855894 2857354 | gotta clean things<br />up here, Doctor.
2857437 2858438 <i>And as a representative</i>
2858521 2859981 <i>of the United States<br />government,</i>
2860065 2861775 / urge you to cooperate.
2861858 2863151 <i>Get on that plane<br />to Los Angeles,</i>
2864069 2865320 and get your medal<br />from the President.
2872952 2874037 Hello?
2874537 2876706 Call our friends<br />and secure a private charter.
2878124 2879125 To Morocco.
2879209 2880377 Yes, sir.
2881294 2882545 The university murders
2882629 2884589 took place at the height<br />of the parade.
2884672 2885757 Police are searching
2885840 2888093 for retired professor<br />Dr Henry Jones.
2888259 2891262 A colleague told ABC that<br />Jones recently lost his son
2891429 2893431 and was in the middle<br />of a divorce.
2895642 2898853 This guy,<br />he looks like you.
2899813 2902190 Nah. No.
2904150 2906152 -It is you.<br />-No, no, no. Hey.
2906236 2907862 -Go home, pal. You're drunk.<br />-This is the guy!
2907946 2909280 - Hey!<br />- It's the killer!
2911950 2913368 Sorry I'm late, Indy.
2913535 2914953 Bridge traffic.
2925839 2928007 Boy, am | glad<br />to see you, Sallah.
2928842 2930844 | wish | could say the same,<br />old friend.
2934139 2936057 Quickly, Indy. Inside.
2939853 2942147 Your goddaughter, Helena,
2942313 2944983 was arrested in Tangier<br />last year
2945066 2947902 for auctioning contraband.
2950363 2951448 There's more.
2952490 2955910 She was bailed out<br />by Aziz Rahim.
2956661 2959581 Aziz Rahim is the son<br />of Big Rahim,
2959664 2962417 a well-known Moroccan mobster.
2963960 2967630 Big Rahim<br />owns the Hotel Atlantique
2967797 2970383 in Tangier, and this week,
2970550 2974679 the hotel is hosting<br />its annual auction
2974846 2976723 of stolen antiquities.
2977891 2980393 All the big players<br />are already there.
2980560 2982353 Alia, Jabari.
2982520 2984772 This is the great man<br />who brought our family
2984856 2986691 to America during the war.
2986858 2989235 Quick, when was<br />the Suez Crisis?
2989319 2991779 1956.
2992238 2993615 Very impressive, Jabari.
2993781 2996201 My grandchildren watch<br />too much TV,
2996367 2998912 but they know their history.
2999078 3003208 They understand what it is<br />to be American and Egyptian.
3004083 3006252 | need a ride<br />to the airport, Sallah.
3007337 3009839 If you run, the police will<br />assume that you're guilty.
3010548 3011883 Without Helena or the Dial,
3011966 3013885 I'm gonna get framed<br />for murder.
3015053 3016679 Have you thought<br />about calling Marion?
3017764 3019098 She doesn't wanna talk to me.
3025271 3026481 <i>Welcome to New York's</i>
3026564 3028858 John F. Kennedy<br />International Airport.
3029692 3031986 The upper level is<br />for Pan American Airlines...
3032153 3033988 | took something else<br />from your apartment.
3034155 3035365 It was under the bed.
3040578 3041621 Thanks, Sallah.
3043873 3045667 | also brought my passport.
3047710 3048920 | could help you.
3049087 3050088 In Tangier?
3050171 3051798 Wherever chance takes us.
3052715 3053800 Indy, I...
3054717 3056177 | miss the desert.
3056761 3058054 | miss the sea.
3059597 3061391 And | miss waking up<br />every morning
3061558 3062976 wondering what<br />wonderful adventure
3063059 3064686 the new day will bring to us.
3065645 3067647 This is not<br />an adventure, Sallah.
3069107 3071693 Those days have come and gone.
3071859 3072902 Perhaps.
3073069 3074404 Perhaps not.
3078866 3081286 Give 'em hell, Indiana Jones!
3093089 3094173 Champagne?
3094549 3096426 We've got four more hours<br />to Tangier.
3104183 3105602 Your scotch, sir.
3106227 3107228 Thanks.
3114152 3115528 Basil. Come on, Baz/
3115695 3117447 - Open the door!<br />- No/
3117614 3119115 -Stay out, Indy!<br />-Open the door.
3122327 3124203 The Germans were right, Indy.
3124287 3126664 - Huh? What?<br />- It's too big. It's too much.
3126831 3128499 Hey, Ba... Hey, hey! Hey, Baz!
3128583 3129584 -Give me...<br />-No.
3129667 3130668 What are you doing?
3130752 3131961 You've listened<br />to nothing that | said.
3132045 3133838 | don't understand it, Baz!
3134172 3136132 Well, | was trying to<br />explain it to you downstairs.
3136215 3137508 You've just<br />ignored everything.
3137592 3138593 You're terrifying<br />your daughter.
3140762 3142847 Indy, Archimedes
3143014 3145224 discovered<br />a temporal meteorology.
3145433 3148061 Archimedes was<br />a mathematician, Baz,
3148227 3149437 not a magician.
3149604 3152065 He could predict<br />fissures in time.
3152231 3153775 Fissures in time?
3154150 3157195 -Baz, you can't prove that!<br />-Well, not yet.
3157362 3159238 Proving it<br />is what makes it science!
3174504 3175713 Oh, Baz.
3177423 3178966 | never should've<br />given you the thing.
3179217 3181177 It... It belongs in a museum.
3182095 3183805 Give it to me. Please.
3187392 3188768 If | give you this,
3189977 3191437 it must be destroyed.
3192939 3194023 | will.
3196651 3198069 I'll destroy it, Baz.
3200571 3201572 Promise.
3207704 3209205 I'm sorry about this.
3209372 3210581 It's all my fault.
3212792 3214252 -Are you gonna be here?<br />-Yes, sir.
3214335 3216421 Okay. I've gotta catch<br />an aeroplane.
3216587 3219382 If anyone finds the Grafikos,<br />they'll have both halves.
3219465 3220800 Some things<br />should stay buried.
3220883 3221884 | know, Baz.
3221968 3223177 It's vital<br />that you destroy it.
3223261 3224679 - | will, Baz.<br />- Do you understand?
3224762 3226389 - I'll destroy it. Yes.<br />- Say you will, Indy.
3226472 3227473 | will... Yes.
3227557 3229183 You promised me.<br />Remember that.
3229267 3230309 | will... | promise.
3230393 3231436 There's a reason,
3231519 3234105 a reason that Archimedes<br />broke it in two.
3234272 3235982 | know, Baz.
3236149 3238276 -Indy.
3239026 3240319 Thanks, Wombat.
3240486 3242447 He's gonna be all right<br />in a few days.
3244532 3245950 I'll call you<br />as soon as | land.
3250955 3252373 Ladies and gentlemen,
3252457 3254917 <i>we are 20 minutes<br />from landing in Tangier.</i>
3288701 3290077 -Stop drinking!<br />-What are you doing?
3290161 3291829 No more champagne!<br />How many more...
3291913 3292955 I'm staying.
3293039 3294499 Go home. Go home!
3310014 3311098 Rahim.
3311182 3313518 Miss Shaw, she's here.
3317772 3318940 Forged in bronze.
3319023 3320066 Nearly complete.
3320149 3321859 It is an astrological clock.
3322443 3324654 Dating third century BC
3324821 3328741 and built<br />by Archimedes himself.
3330785 3332203 All right,<br />let's start at 20,000.
3332286 3333454 20,000, thank you very much.
3333621 3334956 30. 30.
3335122 3337792 Gauges green, power full,
3337959 3340294 and when | reach 85, | rotate.
3340878 3341879 What next?
3341963 3343256 Louis, help him! He's so cute.
3343339 3345383 -Pull back on the yoke.<br />- did, man. I'm airborne.
3345466 3346467 Yeah, he's airborne.
3346551 3347844 -Can | have a sip?<br />-Do | pick up the flaps?
3347927 3349929 Don't touch the flaps<br />under 400 feet.
3350096 3351764 Decrease your pitch<br />to get to 120.
3351931 3352932 All right.
3355518 3357770 -Private auction, old timer.<br />-I've gotta get in there.
3357937 3360439 No password, no entry.<br />| don't make the rules.
3363276 3364318 And, er,<br />what is the current bid?
3364402 3366404 -The bid is 50,000.<br />-Then | bid 55.
3366487 3368030 Who'll give me 607?
3368114 3369657 -60. 657
3369740 3371075 65. 707
3371158 3372493 - 75.<br />- 75. 807
3372577 3373578 -80.<br />-85.
3373661 3374871 How about 907
3381627 3383880 -This auction is private.<br />-This auction's over.
3384297 3385631 Au contlraire,<br />it's hardly begun.
3385715 3387174 - 100.<br />- 100,000.
3387341 3388885 | like the hat, by the way.
3388968 3390303 Makes you look<br />at least two years younger.
3390469 3391637 Thanks.
3391721 3392722 -110, bravo.<br />-1 told you that
3392805 3394765 -this auction is over.<br />-Excuse me, who is this man?
3394932 3396392 -I'm her godfather.<br />-He's mildly related.
3396475 3398394 And she's up past her bedtime.
3398561 3399770 -Come on, Wombat.<br />-1 wouldn't do that.
3399937 3401439 You want to explain it<br />to the cops at the bar?
3401606 3402940 The ones | paid off?
3403482 3405067 You're out of your depth,<br />Jonesy.
3405234 3406652 -"Jonesy"?<br />-He thinks I'm a criminal.
3406736 3408487 He's the one<br />wanted for murder.
3408654 3410698 Nice big picture<br />in the New York Herald. 1307
3410865 3412450 | didn't kill anyone.
3412533 3413534 No entry,<br />it's a private auction.
3413618 3414827 And you know it,<br />Helena.
3415328 3418497 But whoever did<br />was looking for this.
3419165 3421042 What you've got here<br />is Pandora's Box.
3422293 3423502 No, actually.
3424378 3425838 It's my box.
3428466 3429467 You.
3431177 3432303 Have we met?
3432595 3433596 No.
3433679 3435097 My memory<br />is a little fuzzy,
3435181 3436891 but your face rings a bell.
3437475 3438517 Are you still a Nazi?
3442647 3444815 You're confused.<br />My name is Schmidt.
3445399 3447568 Professor Schmidt<br />of Alabama University.
3449278 3451572 Professor Schmidt. How nice<br />to meet you in person.
3451656 3453199 150.
3453282 3454367 After our conversation,<br />Miss Shaw,
3454533 3456494 | thought we'd come to<br />an agreement about the Dial.
3456577 3457578 Funny. The last time
3457662 3458955 | saw the other guy<br />who looks like you,
3459038 3460790 he was also after this.
3461374 3463000 Your numbers were light,<br />Professor Schmidt.
3463084 3465002 But good news is, you're here<br />now. The bid is 160.
3465086 3466921 You don't seem<br />to understand, Miss Shaw.
3467004 3468297 This relic is my property.
3468381 3470883 -It's not yours. You stole it.<br />-Then you stole it.
3471050 3472635 And then | stole it.<br />It's called capitalism.
3472718 3473761 The bid is 160.
3473844 3474845 - 160.<br />- 170?
3474929 3475930 You should've<br />stayed in New York.
3476013 3477014 - 1707<br />-You should've stayed
3477098 3479892 - out of Poland.<br />- 170. Anyone? Anyone?
3480059 3481352 Going, going...
3481727 3482728 Gone!
3483354 3484355 Stay away!
3486107 3487108 Get the Dial.
3491070 3492780 Stay away!
3502081 3503082 Oh, hello, Claude.
3503165 3504542 You should not<br />have come back, Helena.
3513509 3514927 Get back.
3525646 3526647 Teddy!
3541037 3542163 Rahim says you stay.
3553966 3554967 Thank you.
3568064 3569523 See you in the past,<br />Dr Jones.
3596550 3597551 It's my cab!
3603140 3604308 Tell them to back off.
3604475 3605851 | just told them to shoot you.
3607937 3609146 All right, guys.
3610523 3611899 Put the guns down.
3612066 3613275 Put 'em down.
3615236 3616237 All right.
3617905 3619198 That's better.
3623077 3624703 Oh, dear.
3634755 3635881 Rahim.
3636966 3638467 You're in pyjamas.
3638968 3640636 | was sleeping, Helena.
3640719 3641804 - Mmm-hmm.<br />- Peacefully.
3641887 3642888 Oh.
3642972 3644807 My father woke me.
3644974 3647601 He told me you'd<br />returned to our hotel.
3649103 3651355 Then he handed me<br />this scimitar
3651522 3654358 and told me to come home<br />with your head.
3655067 3656110 Huh.
3656193 3657486 Does it have to be that bit?
3665244 3668038 | thought maybe you returned<br />because you loved me.
3668205 3669331 Rahim,
3670082 3671667 | had an item to sell.
3671834 3673711 Excuse me. The item<br />she's talking about
3673794 3674795 -actually belongs to me.<br />-No.
3674879 3676172 You do not need to intrude<br />in this conversation.
3676255 3677381 And some very bad people,<br />worse people...
3677464 3678674 You do not need to get<br />involved with my business.
3678757 3680217 -...have run off with it.<br />-Is this your new man?
3680301 3682011 -No. No, no, no, no.<br />-It's complicated.
3683345 3684847 What exactly<br />do you owe this guy?
3685014 3687099 Just some bail money<br />and a lifetime of happiness.
3687266 3688934 | presume you sold the ring.
3689101 3690436 It didn't go for as much<br />as | thought it would.
3690895 3691937 I'll do it!
3692021 3693105 What are you... Hey!
3699445 3700946 You just got me killed!
3701113 3703699 Well, I'm not the one that's<br />engaged to a mobster!
3703866 3706785 | don't need morality lessons<br />from an ageing grave robber!
3706952 3708162 I'm not a grave robber.
3708329 3710331 Your father and |<br />did important work together.
3713000 3714585 Don't tell me<br />all your escapades were noble,
3714668 3716295 selfless quests.<br />You did it for the buzz!
3719006 3720049 Oh, good work, Teddy!
3721550 3723219 -Move over, kid.<br />-Hey!
3733938 3735814 -Helena!<br />-Back up! Back up!
3753707 3754708 Not this way!
3754792 3756460 You don't know where you're<br />going, Indy! Listen to him.
3756543 3757878 -He knows this town!<br />-I know Tangier!
3762383 3763425 There he is!
3768555 3770683 Faster. Go faster!
3770849 3772768 Ten minutes<br />to the airport, boss.
3774770 3776105 I'm not sure<br />Professor Schmidt
3776188 3777481 is an actual professor,<br />by the way.
3777648 3778857 - He's a Nazi!<br />- Turn left!
3778941 3780484 Turn left! Turn left!
3780567 3781735 - Oh, no!<br />- No!
3796417 3798377 Helena! Don't do this!
3806343 3807886 - Hey, this way!<br />- That way!
3808846 3809847 No!
3810806 3812308 Helena!
3814476 3815477 No!
3825070 3826613 What the hell?
3833245 3834496 Helena!
3836457 3838334 Hey! Hey!
3838917 3840502 What the hell?
3843213 3844256 Come on!
3848052 3849887 Come on. Come on!
3883754 3885631 You think<br />he'd be proud of this?
3886548 3887549 Who?
3888884 3890010 Your father!
3890094 3893138 His only daughter selling<br />her soul for bail money!
3893305 3894765 Sounds quite cool<br />when you put it like that.
3894848 3896475 And it's not all bail money.
3896558 3897851 Some of it's gambling debt
3897935 3899019 -and some...<br />-Thank you, Teddy.
3899103 3900896 Helena! No!
3900979 3901980 Helena!
3903690 3905567 How did you end up like this?
3905734 3907069 Well, you mean resourceful?
3907236 3909571 Daring? Beautiful?<br />Self-sufficient?
3919415 3920958 Whoa!
3934888 3936348 Hold on!
3939435 3940436 Go this way!
3949820 3950821 There he is.
3962875 3964042 Stop!
3964126 3965919 - Hey! Hey!<br />- Stop!
3968964 3970257 Aah!
3978640 3979808 On the left!
3980934 3981935 Take the wheel, Teddy!
3984146 3985189 What are you doing?
3985355 3986899 Getting what's mine.
3987858 3988859 Helena!
3993071 3995199 Damn it! You crazy?
3996658 3999161 Hey! Helena!
4003123 4004750 - Take the gun!<br />- Miss Shaw.
4006168 4007836 Let go, Miss Shaw!
4030275 4031693 Let go.
4031777 4034154 Come on! Give me the Dial!
4034905 4036949 <i>Helena!</i>
4038325 4039785 Damn.
4046542 4047668 Turn back! They went that way!
4047751 4048752 He's gone!
4048835 4050671 - Move over!<br />- Hey!
4054091 4057052 | didn't come here to<br />rescue you from your fiancé!
4057135 4058136 Rescue me?
4063308 4064935 | just want the Dial back.
4084371 4085998 Put your hands<br />above your head.
4087124 4088584 Not the smoothest<br />break-up | ever had.
4088667 4089918 If your father<br />was still alive...
4090002 4091044 Well, he's not, Indy.
4091128 4092629 Hey, something's wrong<br />with the engine.
4092713 4093922 If only there'd been<br />someone there for me,
4094006 4095507 some father figure, someone
4095591 4097718 specifically anointed<br />for the job.
4097884 4099177 You have no idea<br />about the kind...
4099261 4100262 Don't beat yourself up<br />about it.
4100345 4102389 | mean,<br />what even is a godfather?
4103390 4105434 Anyway, family never<br />was your strong suit.
4106101 4108437 -What is the time, by the way?<br />-It's...
4108604 4109605 Hey, no fair.
4110314 4111356 Give me that back.
4111440 4112649 That was my father's watch!
4115068 4116069 Give it back to him.
4120532 4121950 You're gonna have<br />to leave town with me.
4122117 4123619 Rahim will be<br />looking for you too.
4123785 4124995 They'll go to<br />Tangier airport first,
4125078 4126079 so we'll need to catch a train
4126163 4127331 and get a plane<br />from Casablanca.
4128206 4130417 Whoa. What was that?
4134296 4135422 Ah.
4135505 4136506 Damn.
4138925 4140010 Yeah.
4140093 4141219 | know, sir.
4143430 4144431 Yes...
4145682 4146683 Copy.
4151772 4153065 They pulled the plug.
4153148 4154524 You got them scared.
4154900 4156068 Because they don't understand.
4156151 4157736 No. Because your associates
4157819 4159154 killed three<br />American civilians
4159321 4161573 and blew up<br />a nationally televised parade.
4161740 4162908 Because you stood up
4162991 4164701 the President<br />of the United States,
4164868 4166036 ran to Morocco,
4166203 4168580 and created an incident that<br />required military extraction!
4170707 4172417 Then take me to DC,<br />and | will explain it all.
4172501 4173919 They want you to vanish.
4174086 4176213 We have half the Dial now.
4176380 4177714 They were just trying<br />to keep you happy,
4178715 4180384 letting you chase that thing.
4180550 4181593 They never cared about it.
4181677 4182761 They will, Miss Mason,
4182844 4184471 when they understand<br />what it can do.
4184638 4185764 You put them<br />on the moon.
4186473 4187724 They got what they wanted.
4189017 4190936 All right, buckle up.<br />We're landing in Spain.
4191561 4193563 C-9 transport will take you<br />from there to Maxwell.
4193730 4195190 I'm not going back to Alabama!
4195357 4197609 All we need is a vessel to<br />take us to the Mediterranean.
4198276 4199695 The Grafikos<br />will take us to the other...
4199778 4201863 Please, Miss Mason. Please.
4202030 4203073 Let go of me, Schmidt.
4203240 4204866 I'm asking you personally.
4205784 4207202 You're a piece of work, Doc.
4208745 4209746 Hey!
4237774 4239276 Schmidt...
4240193 4241820 My name is Voller.
4244614 4245991 Jurgen Voller.
4259254 4261047 That's a Sea Stallion.
4261214 4262632 American helicopter.
4263633 4265343 Did you know<br />the Wright Brothers?
4265802 4267262 - What?<br />- The Wright Brothers.
4267429 4268513 Orville and Wilbur.
4268680 4270932 They invented the aeroplane,<br />and they lived in Indiana.
4271099 4272642 Wilbur was born in Indiana.
4272809 4275228 I'm not from Indiana, Teddy.
4275312 4277939 And the Wright Brothers were<br />born during the Civil War.
4278106 4280233 Oh, | thought maybe you went<br />to school with them.
4281651 4284112 Oh, come on, Indy.<br />That was funny.
4284279 4285572 -"Funny"?<br />-Mmm-hmm.
4286239 4287532 I'm stuck in Tangier
4287616 4289951 with a broken tuk-tuk<br />and two thieves.
4290118 4291328 I'm wanted for murder.
4291411 4293413 Nazis have<br />half of Archimedes' Dial
4293580 4294998 and your father's notebooks.
4296208 4297375 | have a copy.
4298210 4299669 Dad's notebooks.<br />| made a copy.
4299753 4301671 Where?
4301755 4303715 You memorised five notebooks?
4303882 4305091 Seven. And of course not.
4305258 4306885 Half of them were<br />as dull as ditchwater.
4307761 4310180 Just the really<br />important bits.
4311056 4312057 Like what?
4312516 4313642 The location of the Grafikos.
4313809 4315519 Nobody knows<br />where the Grafikos is.
4315685 4317020 -Dad did.<br />-No, he didn't.
4317187 4318355 -Yes, he did.<br />-No, he didn't.
4318522 4320148 -Yes, he did.<br />-What's a Grafikos?
4320315 4321608 It's directions<br />to the rest of the Dial.
4321775 4323276 Ask her if she knows<br />what language it's in.
4323360 4325362 Ah! It isn't in a language.<br />It's in a code.
4325529 4326738 What code?
4326905 4328365 Archimedes used two codes.
4328532 4330075 Linear B and Polybius Square.
4330242 4331868 So, even if you find<br />the Grafikos,
4331952 4333578 without me, you can't read it.
4333662 4335413 Please.
4335580 4337415 Dad taught me Polybius<br />when | was nine.
4337582 4339251 Used to leave little notes<br />around the house.
4339334 4340335 "Tidy your room."
4340418 4341711 "Stay away from my brandy."
4342838 4343880 What if it's Linear B?
4344840 4346216 50 quid it's Polybius.
4347259 4348385 Give me that.
4348468 4349469 Hey.
4349886 4351096 That won't work.
4351263 4353515 Moroccan chewing gum's made<br />from the sap of the Manilkara.
4353682 4354975 Heat resistant.
4356476 4357686 Try and start it.
4362607 4363775 -Start it.<br />-1 am.
4365318 4367445 Huh? Huh?
4368154 4369739 -Huh?<br />-t won't hold.
4369906 4371825 It'll get us<br />to the train station.
4371992 4373118 “US“?
4373285 4374494 - You goin' home?<br />- No.
4374661 4376454 I'm going to Casablanca.
4376621 4378373 Then I'm gonna hop a plane<br />to the Aegean.
4378456 4379457 Just like you.
4379875 4381418 What makes you think<br />we're going to the Aegean?
4381585 4384671 You gotta get to the Grafikos<br />before the Nazis.
4384838 4386923 Archimedes was<br />surrounded by Romans.
4387632 4388842 Where else would it be?
4389009 4390010 The Aegean is huge, Indy.
4390176 4391303 And you don't<br />have coordinates.
4391469 4393013 And you don't have a boat.
4395932 4398351 I've got an old friend<br />in Greece.
4398518 4399895 An expert diver.
4400061 4401897 With a big, beautiful boat
4402063 4404107 that'll get us there<br />before they will.
4404983 4407027 You need me,
4407193 4408403 and you know it.
4458536 4459788 Renny!
4461873 4462916 Indy?
4463750 4464793 Indy!
4470256 4472217 So, that's the expert diver?
4472384 4474594 Spain's greatest frogman.
4476763 4478390 Hey!
4478556 4480642 So, Spain's greatest frogman<br />has a shit boat
4480725 4482018 and only one good frog leg?
4482185 4483228 Stop it.
4487023 4488233 You got<br />a different boat.
4488316 4489526 Stop it.
4503790 4504833 We're going here.
4506459 4508920 Where they found the first<br />part of the Antikythera.
4509838 4511006 But...
4512340 4513633 we're going deeper.
4515218 4517220 Dad tracked down<br />the old sponge diver
4517303 4518930 who found the Dial.
4519097 4520265 He told him
4520432 4523393 that the wrecked Roman ship<br />broke up under the sea
4523560 4524686 70 feet below.
4524853 4527814 Filled with the skeletons<br />of over 100 centurions.
4528982 4530150 That's where they found it.
4530900 4534821 But he said that most<br />of the ship had broken off
4534988 4536740 and sunk to the ocean floor.
4537699 4539284 Too deep for sponge divers.
4540326 4543163 So, Dad started wondering<br />why a Roman warship
4543329 4546708 would sail out of Syracuse<br />with 100 centurions on board.
4550420 4553798 They weren't taking<br />half a Dial for a joyride.
4557635 4559220 They had the Grafikos...
4562098 4564267 and they were looking<br />for the rest of the Dial.
4567562 4569189 Your dad was a genius.
4569814 4570857 Yeah.
4572275 4573318 He was.
4593171 4594172 Seven of spades.
4597467 4598551 How do you do that?
4598718 4600136 Wow.
4600220 4601429 Do it again.
4605433 4607310 Pick a card, Dr Jones.
4614818 4615944 Seven of spades!
4618071 4619114 She's magic.
4619280 4620448 Trick deck.
4620615 4621616 No.
4622784 4624202 | force the card.
4624369 4625662 | offer the mark,
4625829 4626996 you,
4627163 4628164 the feeling of a choice,
4628331 4630542 but ultimately, | make you<br />pick the card | want.
4632669 4633837 "The mark."
4636881 4638800 Yeah. Tomorrow is a big day.
4638883 4640718 | have to check the lines.
4646766 4647851 Good night.
4650979 4654107 You remember seeing any dates<br />in your father's notebooks?
4655441 4656818 Dates?
4656901 4658278 What dates?
4659195 4660196 These dates.
4663908 4666369 Written over and over again<br />in this letter.
4667787 4669622 August 20th, 1969.
4669789 4671332 That's three days from now.
4671499 4673751 And the same date in 1939.
4673918 4676337 Two weeks before<br />Hitler invades Poland.
4678173 4679757 Wait.
4680550 4682886 Now you believe the Dial<br />has magical powers?
4684179 4686222 | don't believe in magic,<br />Wombat.
4688099 4690476 But a few times in my life,<br />I've seen things.
4693605 4695356 Things | can't explain.
4696691 4699068 And I've come to believe<br />it's not so much
4699235 4701362 what you believe.
4701529 4703781 It's how hard you believe it.
4706910 4708244 I've seen things too, Indy.
4709162 4711706 The only thing<br />worth believing in, ever,
4711873 4713541 is cash.
4715835 4716920 Right.
4722717 4723843 What if you could<br />go back in time?
4726179 4727222 What would you do?
4728598 4730016 Witness the Trojan War?
4731309 4732644 Check in on Cleopatra?
4736272 4738399 I'd stop my son<br />from enlisting.
4741569 4743279 Did he sign up to please you?
4744364 4746574 No, he signed up<br />to piss me off.
4750245 4751746 How would you<br />have stopped him?
4756626 4758461 I'd tell him<br />he was gonna die.
4765510 4767387 I'd tell him<br />that his mother would...
4770014 4771849 find no end to her grief.
4773685 4775436 And that his father<br />would be...
4778273 4780191 helpless to console her.
4783486 4785989 And that the loss would put<br />an end to their marriage.
4800003 4801212 You're still wearing the ring.
4820982 4822233 Mmm.
4823901 4825320 Promising.
4834037 4835455 More promising.
4841252 4842337 Hello.
4844547 4846549 Get your gear on.<br />They're waiting.
4851179 4852263 Hey.
4853264 4854265 Come here.
4855099 4856476 Okay.
4856559 4857560 I'm gonna show you something.
4857643 4860646 Gosh, this looks important.
4862815 4863816 Around the rope...
4863900 4866027 Now, we are going deep.
4866194 4869030 Descend fast, and breathe<br />through these hoses.
4869197 4870239 Okay?
4870323 4872033 Ah, stay separate.
4872200 4874160 No crisscross. All right?
4874327 4875495 We cannot stay long.
4875661 4878998 | have a method that<br />usually prevents the bends.
4879999 4881125 - Usually?<br />- Yeah.
4881209 4882418 | call it "the bounce."
4882585 4883586 You know, fast down,
4883753 4885671 three minutes on the bottom,<br />and then up.
4885838 4886881 Three minutes!
4887048 4888883 No one more second.
4889550 4891803 -Three minutes.<br />-Yeah, that's right.
4891969 4893805 -Where is my lighter?<br />-I don't know, capitan.
4894180 4895973 We have to go.
4898309 4899769 Er, quick question.
4899936 4901270 What's that?
4901437 4902814 -They're sharks?<br />-No.
4902897 4905274 No, no. No sharks here. Eels.
4906359 4908653 -Eels?<br />-Anguilas.
4908736 4909737 Most are small.
4909904 4911489 Sometimes they are big.<br />Two metres.
4911656 4913699 But if you see them,<br />stay still.
4913866 4917078 They bite you,<br />they lock the jaw. Yeah.
4917245 4918663 They look like snakes.
4919372 4920373 No, they don't.
4920456 4922625 Private Brandy<br />reporting for duty.
4923126 4924127 You're not coming, Teddy?
4924877 4926003 | can't swim.
4926170 4927296 Lucky him.
4927463 4928756 Everyone can swim.
4930633 4932510 Reach and pull.<br />Reach and pull.
4934554 4935638 All right.<br />You stay here
4935721 4937014 with Hector<br />and watch our lines.
4940017 4941936 It is time, camarada.
5050294 5051295 Two minutes?
5184553 5185554 Hey.
5217420 5218421 Hurry up!
5233477 5234979 Helena!
5243738 5244739 Come on.
5244905 5246449 That's it. That's it.<br />That's it.
5247283 5248492 That's it.
5271849 5273017 Who are these people?
5275269 5276270 Nazis.
5276353 5278814 First, you return my Dial,<br />Dr Jones,
5278981 5282109 and now,<br />you bring me the Grafikos.
5283027 5285196 I'm very happy you're not<br />wasting in retirement.
5285571 5287948 | should have retired you<br />when | had the chance.
5288115 5289241 Where are your sponsors?
5289408 5290993 I'm on my own now.
5291160 5292828 Things move forward,<br />Dr Jones.
5292912 5293913 And sometimes...
5295790 5297583 they go backward.
5300836 5303088 Now, let's get comfortable<br />and have a little talk.
5330157 5331534 What language is that?
5331700 5333285 It's not a language.
5334537 5335621 It's a code.
5336455 5337456 Polybius.
5338290 5339583 You owe me 50 quid.
5341919 5343712 Not familiar<br />with Polybius cipher?
5343879 5344880 No.
5345631 5347049 But it appears you are.
5351428 5352638 Read it, please.
5360771 5361772 No.
5367528 5368529 Indy...
5379623 5380916 Feeling helpful now?
5384169 5385170 | am.
5388340 5389592 | know this stuff backwards.
5389758 5390843 No!
5392428 5393429 Sorry, Indy.
5393846 5395222 | don't do noble death.
5395890 5396974 Just
5397141 5398559 cold, hard maths.
5399101 5400936 | crack the code,<br />help you find the other half.
5402354 5403981 One hundred grand. Cash.
5404064 5405149 Helena...
5405816 5406817 Take it or leave it.
5408319 5409361 You have a deal.
5422958 5424668 He'll never pay you.
5426211 5427546 I think<br />you will find this is worth
5427630 5429089 more than your asking price.
5438599 5440100 -Teddy.<br />-Helena,
5440267 5441435 don't do this.
5446857 5448275 Let's see what we've got here.
5450444 5451820 "My Makhana..."”
5452321 5453322 that's "machine"...
5454573 5458118 "lies with me,<br />in the city | left.
5458285 5460663 "Where wolves<br />teach men to walk.
5460829 5464959 "Under one of nine, | lie."
5467795 5469505 Only one thing<br />lies anywhere forever.
5469672 5472383 The dead. So, if the Dial lies<br />with him, then...
5474259 5475761 then this is directions<br />to his tomb.
5476261 5477596 The Tomb of Archimedes?
5479014 5480808 Undiscovered<br />for two millennia.
5483894 5485980 "The city | left."
5486605 5488649 Archimedes lived two places<br />his entire life,
5488732 5490067 so he only left one.
5490943 5492945 Anyone? At the back?
5493821 5495364 Come on, Indy.<br />Everyone knows this.
5495531 5497366 -Even this clown.<br />-Alexandria.
5498033 5499868 Full marks.
5500327 5502496 Now, "wolf"<br />in Greek is “/ycos.”
5502579 5504915 Root of the word<br />"lycaeum” or "school."
5505082 5507710 And the Doric<br />for "walking" is...
5508961 5509962 "peripatio.”
5511255 5514008 Which also happens to be<br />the word for...
5515342 5516593 Aw.
5519263 5521223 | thought you were<br />a bright spark.
5523809 5526937 "Peripatio” means "walking,"
5527104 5529523 but it also means "counting.”
5529690 5532818 So, "Where wolves<br />teach men to walk"
5533569 5535863 -could be...<br />-The School of Mathematics.
5537197 5538782 Is correct.
5538949 5540492 Now, the next bit is easy.
5541785 5543370 "Beneath one of nine"?
5544538 5545873 There are nine Muses.
5546040 5547166 The Museon.
5547332 5549793 The Greek word for the<br />Great Library of Alexandria.
5549877 5551003 Which, as we all know,
5551086 5553756 has nine statues<br />supporting its roof.
5553922 5554923 May 1?
5556091 5557217 Thank you.
5558385 5561138 The nine Muses,<br />in reverse order,
5562598 5564099 are Calliope,
5564850 5565851 Urania,
5567436 5568479 Polymnia,
5569438 5570981 -Erato...<br />-Polymnia.
5571190 5573567 ...and Meli whasisname,
5573942 5574943 that other one,
5575694 5576695 Thalia,
5577446 5578655 Euteroe,
5578822 5580908 but the first is...
5581158 5582159 Clio.
5583994 5585162 The Muse of history and time.
5585329 5586538 That Archimedes,
5586705 5587956 - what a clever bugger.<br />- The entrance
5588040 5590167 to the tomb is by<br />the School of Mathematics,
5590334 5592044 under a statue of Clio,
5592211 5594963 in the ruins of the Great<br />Library of Alexandria.
5595130 5596423 Gold star for Dr Brains.
5597800 5598801 Teddy!
5608727 5610312 The Grafikos, get it!
5637965 5640676 | have said it before,<br />and | will say it again!
5640843 5643470 When you're<br />in a tight spot, dynamite.
5645222 5646765 My friend was just murdered.
5652271 5653272 Sorry.
5653438 5655190 You told them everything.
5656900 5657985 Word for word.
5658610 5660529 But Archimedes<br />didn't make it that easy.
5661321 5663240 The tomb isn't in Alexandria.
5672291 5673292 Go!
5676753 5677754 So, what do you see?
5678422 5680215 Polybius square.
5680757 5681884 Made of?
5684428 5685637 Wax and wood.
5687264 5688515 Anything else?
5691977 5692978 It's heavy.
5696023 5697149 Too heavy.
5699276 5700402 Give me that.
5740609 5742319 This is solid gold?
5742486 5743695 Ancient gold.
5745197 5746198 From the Nile.
5747866 5748867 Hold it, Teddy.
5760379 5761463 Sell this thing
5761630 5763298 and we are out of the hole<br />and then some.
5763382 5764383 | have just the customer.
5764549 5765926 Cranky, old Duchess<br />in Gibraltar...
5766009 5767970 This is going in a museum.
5770847 5772140 Take the wheel, Teddy.
5779022 5780023 What does it say?
5782150 5785028 "Search where Dionysius
5785821 5788573 "hears each whisper
5789408 5791451 "like a hurricane."
5794288 5795706 The Ear.
5796415 5798208 The cave of Dionysius.
5799042 5800043 Where is that?
5801503 5802546 In Sicily.
5804047 5806133 - How much fuel have we got?<br />- It's full.
5815142 5816143 They're heading west.
5817519 5818520 Not east.
5847466 5849593 - | want the papaya.<br />- How much is it?
5853055 5854056 Take this.
5856808 5858977 Look at that kid<br />with the straw hat.
5859269 5861063 This way.
5864649 5865650 Hey.
5866693 5869154 What do you think?
5874951 5876203 What are we doing?
5877829 5879498 Waiting for closing time<br />at the caves.
5879664 5881166 It's crawling with tourists.
5881333 5883752 Okay, so he's, like,<br />running the show now?
5885128 5886546 He's not running<br />the show, Teddy.
5887923 5891051 | just thought we were in this<br />for all the wrong reasons.
5891635 5892803 We are.
5896264 5897265 Most assuredly.
5897349 5900102 You know he's never gonna<br />let us sell any of that stuff.
5901645 5903271 I'm still in charge, Teddy.
5903355 5904398 Helena,<br />get over here!
5904481 5905482 Give me a hand!
5911405 5912531 Oh, you splurged.
5913865 5914908 Here's your backpack.
5914991 5916034 Where's the kid?
5929965 5931550 Hey, watch it!
5931633 5932884 What's wrong<br />with you?
5961413 5962581 Hello.
5963999 5965000 Hey.
5967752 5969004 Let me go!
5970297 5971339 Let me go!
5979139 5981892 Get off me! Let me go!
5985020 5986229 Hey, hey, hey!
5997073 5998158 Helenal!
5999534 6000952 They've got Teddy.
6003079 6004664 They took him<br />up the hill somewhere.
6013548 6015550 Hey. Hey! Hey!
6024768 6025852 What are they<br />gonna do to him?
6026019 6028688 He knows about the Ear,<br />what the Grafikos says.
6030065 6031525 They're not gonna hurt him.
6031691 6032859 They're gonna use him
6033610 6035862 to get the other half<br />of the Dial.
6035946 6036988 We gotta get there first.
6050168 6054214 Colonising queens<br />built many cities in Sicily.
6054381 6055882 -The temple...<br />-Let's go.
6056550 6059094 ...is the oldest<br />of the Greek temples.
6060178 6061555 The cave's over there.
6071940 6073692 Could we go<br />a little faster, please?
6082909 6084369 The Ear of Dionysius.
6092085 6093086 Wow.
6107309 6109019 "Search where Dionysius hears
6109102 6110812 "each whisper<br />like a hurricane."
6112022 6113023 That's some echo.
6114774 6117360 Keep making noise till we<br />find out where it's loudest.
6134794 6135962 Stop.
6143553 6144679 This is it.
6149643 6151144 Greek pediment.
6151811 6152812 An entrance.
6154230 6155231 Used to be.
6158526 6159527 A crescent.
6162405 6163490 Just like on the Grafikos.
6171081 6172916 | think there's<br />an opening up there.
6179547 6180548 You okay up there?
6181716 6182884 Yes.
6185387 6186429 You're not moving.
6188932 6190141 I'm thinking.
6192977 6193978 About?
6195146 6198066 About what the hell I'm doing<br />up here, 40 feet in the air,
6198400 6199984 with crap shoulders,
6200151 6201945 crumbling vertebrae,
6202112 6204614 a plate in one leg,<br />screws in the other.
6204781 6206032 Yeah, | get it. | get it.
6206658 6207784 No, you don't get it.
6208618 6209828 You're half my age.
6210870 6213540 You haven't been forced<br />to drink the blood of Kali.
6213707 6214958 No. Fair enough.
6215792 6217544 Or been tortured with voodoo.
6218920 6219921 And I'm just guessing,
6220004 6221673 but | don't think<br />you've been shot nine times,
6221840 6224300 including once by your father.
6226052 6227387 Dad shot you?
6228096 6229264 Don't talk to me.
6229431 6230598 Just go ahead.<br />I'll follow you.
6239357 6241943 No, no, no. We are close.<br />We are close.
6242110 6243111 Look around you.
6243278 6244779 -We are close.<br />-The Cave of Dionysius.
6244946 6247824 No, no, no. The cave<br />is closed for renovation.
6248825 6249826 Oh.
6249909 6250952 Let me ask again.
6251035 6252954 Where is<br />the Cave of Dionysius?
6272599 6274768 What's the matter?<br />You worried about the kid?
6276060 6277729 Are you sure<br />they won't hurt him?
6277896 6279105 He'll be fine.
6279272 6280315 He's smart.
6282192 6283568 Where'd you find him?
6284360 6287405 He, er... He tried to steal<br />my purse outside a casino
6287489 6289949 in Marrakesh when he was 10.
6290116 6291951 | hit him repeatedly<br />with my car door,
6292118 6294621 but he didn't let go<br />and neither did |.
6294788 6296331 So, been together ever since.
6297457 6299417 Thought you were<br />all about the money.
6300543 6301544 | am.
6304631 6306466 Nobody memorises every page
6306549 6308676 of their<br />dead father's notebooks
6308843 6309928 for the money.
6316559 6318019 HerrVoller!
6328196 6329572 They went that way.
6339916 6341668 Why?
6344879 6346714 Come on, come on.
6348591 6350385 Let's go.
6355098 6356099 Oh, my...
6359143 6360645 Oh, my God!
6361479 6362814 Oh, my God!
6363022 6364399 - Oh, God!<br />- No, no.
6365316 6366693 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
6371239 6372866 Are they off me? Get 'em off!
6372949 6374617 -No, no. Wait.<br />-Get 'em off!
6387672 6388756 What is that?
6391718 6393219 Methane.
6394262 6395471 Don't breathe.
6395638 6396639 Don't breathe?
6400351 6401728 We've gotta get outta here.
6410570 6411571 Athena.
6413323 6414616 Goddess of war.
6417493 6418703 And reason.
6422999 6424375 "Under the moon...
6426669 6428671 "life lies at her feet."
6436429 6437764 Water displacement.
6438556 6439891 Get in the pool!
6440058 6442060 Why?<br />Help me open the door.
6442226 6443853 Well, they didn't<br />get out the doors!
6443937 6444938 Get in the pool!
6445980 6447857 Okay, I'm getting in the pool.
6448024 6449150 Help me.
6451569 6453905 Archimedes was fascinated
6455406 6457367 by water displacement!
6471214 6472215 Whoa!
6498366 6500660 Hey! Get back here! Klaber!
6514882 6516050 You don't need to do that.
6542118 6543161 Hey!
6544537 6546289 Give me that!
6547081 6548791 No!
6555339 6556632 Leave them.
6557341 6558968 | said leave them.
6583409 6584952 Reach and pull.
6585119 6586704 Reach and pull.
6586871 6589040 Reach and pull.
6617485 6619028 Archimedes' tomb.
6647974 6649267 Grab that corner.
6695605 6696606 Indy.
6698900 6700276 This frieze...
6702945 6704197 It's a phoenix.
6704363 6705364 A common icon.
6705531 6707116 No. Look,<br />it isn't.
6708701 6710411 This phoenix has propellers.
6719295 6720755 What's this doing here?
6729555 6732558 Clocks won't be invented<br />for 1,000 years,
6733226 6734685 much less watches.
6737230 6738439 Archimedes used it.
6741984 6743361 Dad was right.
6744028 6745029 It works.
6745112 6746739 Of course it works,<br />Miss Shaw.
6749450 6750701 Mathematics works.
6751827 6754830 As it conquered space,<br />it will conquer time.
6762713 6764632 You've already<br />lost your son, Dr Jones.
6764799 6765800 Your wife is gone.
6765883 6767802 Do you really<br />want to lose your godchild?
6770888 6771973 For what?
6772390 6774558 A world that no longer cares<br />about men like us.
6785903 6786904 Thank you.
6825609 6826986 History's greatest moment.
6834076 6835369 Its end.
6843044 6844045 Throw me the gun!
6854430 6856682 -Get him outta here.<br />-Teddy.
6857725 6858851 Teddy! Teddy!
6859018 6860061 Come on! Go!
6860144 6861145 This way. Come on.
6865232 6866776 <i>Go!</i>
6870363 6871364 Indy!
6873366 6874533 Go!
6874700 6875951 Go!
6876118 6877203 Stop!
6880581 6881999 Now what?
6883626 6884627 Bring him.
6892718 6893719 Helena, come on!
6893886 6895179 Teddy, we can't<br />just leave him.
6895262 6896597 We're not! Follow me!
6898557 6899558 Come on!
6903479 6904563 Come on.
6918744 6920704 Teddy. Come on.<br />We've got a car.
6925167 6926585 Ah, crap.
6932800 6933843 Stay there.
6952736 6953737 Hop on.
6957366 6960286 The first hemisphere<br />sets the destination.
6961787 6965374 The second calculates<br />the location of the fissure
6966625 6968461 in Alexandrine coordinates.
6969044 6971922 Have Messner transpose this<br />to longitude and latitude,
6972965 6974842 and transmit waypoints<br />to the pilots.
6986979 6988481 Shortcut.
6992776 6995738 You got coordinates for 37.07.
6995821 6997156 So, who is it?
6997907 6999158 Churchill?
7000493 7001494 Ike?
7003829 7006332 Who are you gonna kill<br />to win the war?
7007166 7010044 In a few minutes,<br />with the help of Archimedes,
7010211 7012087 we shall fly<br />into the eye of this storm
7012880 7015132 and cross into<br />Sicilian airspace
7015299 7018802 on August 20th, 1939.
7019553 7021388 We will head north<br />over friendly skies
7021472 7023098 with enough fuel<br />to reach Munich.
7024391 7026018 My quarry<br />will be waiting for me
7026560 7029021 at 16 Prinzregentenplatz
7029396 7031607 for an update<br />on his V-1 rocket.
7038614 7042576 What kind of Nazi<br />kills the Fuhrer?
7044203 7046872 The kind that believes<br />in victory, Dr Jones.
7052127 7055965 Hitler lit a fire that could<br />have burned 1,000 years.
7056131 7057633 | saw every mistake.
7058425 7059718 Every blunder.
7059885 7061554 And | will correct them all.
7061720 7064348 History is a long list<br />of losses, Dr Jones.
7065391 7066642 It's just a question of whose.
7079321 7080614 Stop!
