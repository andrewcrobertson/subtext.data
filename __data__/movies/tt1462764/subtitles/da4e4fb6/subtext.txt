2095302 2097805 There were irregularities<br />in their rotations.

4323361 4325363 Ah! It isn't in a language.<br />It's in a code.
4325530 4326740 What code?
4326907 4328366 Archimedes used two codes.
4328533 4330076 Linear B and Polybius Square.

5479016 5480809 Undiscovered<br />for two millennia.
5483896 5485981 "The city I left."
5486607 5488651 Archimedes lived two places<br />his entire life,
5488734 5490069 so he only left one.

5541787 5543372 "Beneath one of nine"?
5544540 5545874 There are nine Muses.
5546041 5547167 The <i>Museon.</i>
5547334 5549795 The Greek word for the<br />Great Library of Alexandria.
5549878 5551004 Which, as we all know,
