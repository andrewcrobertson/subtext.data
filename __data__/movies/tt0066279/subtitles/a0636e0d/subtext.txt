151257 153676 <i>We were not<br />the Railway Children to begin with.</i>
153801 156387 <i>I don't suppose we even thought<br />about railways</i>
156513 160225 <i>except as a means of getting<br />to the theatre and the zoo.</i>
160350 162727 <i>We were just ordinary<br />suburban children</i>
162852 165271 <i>and we lived<br />with Father and Mother</i>
165396 167857 <i>in an ordinary<br />red brick fronted villa</i>
167982 169943 <i>with coloured glass<br />in the front door...</i>
170068 171110 Come on.
171236 173821 <i>... a tiled passage<br />that was called a hall</i>
173947 177242 <i>and big fires<br />in big fireplaces.</i>
179077 180912 <i>We even had a gas fire<br />in the breakfast room</i>
182247 183581 <i>and a servant's bell board.</i>
186501 189295 <i>In fact,<br />every modern convenience.</i>
190588 192048 Chins up!
195093 196553 <i>There we three of us.</i>
196678 198263 Now let's arrange your pretty hair.
198388 199931 <i>That's me, I'm Roberta.</i>
200056 202725 <i>They call me Bobbie,<br />sometimes Lanky.</i>
202851 205186 <i>I'm the eldest, worst luck.</i>
206354 209357 <i>That's Phyllis, who means well.</i>
211234 214529 <i>And that's Peter,<br />who wants to be an engineer.</i>
215196 218032 And don't forget<br />to watch the dickey bird.
219951 221452 Watch the birdie.
233631 238094 <i>Mother did not spend all her time<br />paying dull calls to dull ladies</i>
238219 242223 <i>and sitting dully at home waiting<br />for dull ladies to pay calls on her.</i>
242974 245393 <i>She was always there,<br />with us.</i>
251608 254444 <i>We had a father<br />who was just perfect.</i>
256821 260533 Her light's growing dim<br />and if it goes out, then she's dead.
260658 263411 She says she would be get well again<br />if children believed in fairies.
263536 266247 - Do you believe in fairies?<br />- Yes.
266372 269167 That's not loud enough.<br />Do you believe in fairies?
269292 270627 Yes!
270752 273296 It's still not loud enough.<br />Do you believe in fairies?
273421 274756 YES!
274881 276382 Yes, I certainly do!
282597 284849 Mmm, it smells gorgeous.
284974 287852 It's fabulous,<br />absolutely fabulous.
293691 296569 Now altogether... one, two, three.
299072 300532 Well done!
304327 305828 Happy Christmas!
307205 308748 I love you.
309999 313169 <i>You will think that we ought<br />to have been very happy</i>
313294 316089 <i>and we were but we did not know<br />how happy</i>
316214 319425 <i>till the pretty life at Edgecombe Villa<br />was over and done with</i>
319551 322804 <i>and we had to live<br />a very different life indeed.</i>
322929 325139 Peter my boy, come here.
335567 338152 Dad... it's perfect.
338278 342031 It's more perfect<br />than any one could ever dream of.
343825 346286 Thank you, Dad.
347203 350665 <i>The dreadful change<br />came quite suddenly.</i>
367056 368516 You heaving brute!
369475 372770 <i>And that was the last we saw<br />of poor Potts.</i>
373855 376065 What a wreck!
376191 377775 - Is there any hope?<br />- Hope?
377859 381571 Of course, it'll want hope yes,<br />and a new valve.
381696 384032 I'll tell you what, I'll give up<br />Saturday afternoon to it.
384157 385617 Yes, and you can help me.
387452 389954 I hate doing a job like this<br />especially at Christmas.
390079 391581 Who on earth is that?
391706 395502 An Englishman's house is his castle, but<br />I wish they had moats and drawbridges!
396836 398254 Come in.
399506 400798 Yes?
400882 403426 Please, sir. There are two gentlemen<br />wish to see you.
403551 407055 I've shown them into the study, sir,<br />I hope that was all right?
408515 410308 Excuse me.
424948 427325 I wish we did have<br />a moat and drawbridge.
427450 428993 Then if we didn't want anyone to...
429118 432539 I've never heard anything<br />so preposterous. When? Who?
432664 434707 - Why's Daddy shouting?<br />- I don't know, dear.
434833 436167 Come in.
438002 439003 Yes, Ruth?
442048 443007 What is it?
443132 447637 Please, ma'am, the Master wants you<br />to just step into the study.
463278 468366 Look, I'm not going to say a thing!
470118 471911 Come in.
471995 473538 I will not!
545735 548029 All right, cabby,<br />Scotland Yard.
573179 574514 It's bed-time.
574639 576516 Ruth will put you to bed.
576641 580186 But you promised we could stay up late.<br />Daddy was going to play with us.
580311 583690 Father's been<br />called away... on business.
583815 585275 Go up at once darlings, please.
596536 598955 It wasn't bad news,<br />was it, Mummy?
599080 601666 Is anyone dead or...
601791 604294 Oh, no, nobody's dead.
604419 607046 I can't tell you anything about it tonight.<br />Up you go.
625356 629444 96... 97... 98... 99... 100.
638745 641122 Well, good night then.
646127 649130 Ruth!
649255 650715 What's up?
650840 653510 Ask me no questions<br />and I'll tell you no lies.
653635 655094 You'll know soon enough.
685166 687877 - Phyl?<br />- Yes.
688002 692298 If Mother doesn't want us to know<br />she's been crying then we won't know.
692423 695343 - That's all.<br />- All right.
703434 706521 She's gone into London,<br />that's all I know.
706646 709190 Now just you eat up.
710984 715572 Some dire calamity's happening,<br />I just know it.
732964 735758 Good evening, Mrs Waterbury.
744893 747020 - Good evening, ma'am.<br />- Good evening, Sally.
747145 751482 Oh, it's so cold!<br />Let's get to the fire, Peter, come on.
752567 755361 My darlings, those men last night<br />did bring very bad news
755486 757113 and Father will be away<br />for some time
757238 759365 Is it something to do<br />with the Government, Mummy?
759490 760700 Yes... yes, it is.
762660 764954 Now it's bed time, my darlings.
769626 773379 And don't worry.<br />It will all come right in the end.
773505 777509 Don't you worry either<br />because we'll be as good as gold.
784140 789062 Oh, we used to say life was so dull...<br />Nothing ever happened like in books.
789187 790605 Now something has happened.
790730 794901 Yes, it has<br />and it's made Mother unhappy.
796486 798738 Everything's horrid...
798863 800323 ...just horrid.
801241 803243 Stairs... stairs... stairs...
803326 806621 <i>Everything continued to be<br />perfectly horrid for some weeks.</i>
806746 808248 <i>Mother was nearly always out,</i>
808331 811501 <i>the between maid was sent away...</i>
818591 821177 <i>... and Aunt Emma<br />came on a visit.</i>
837569 841239 - Good afternoon, children.<br />- Good afternoon, Aunt Emma.
841322 844242 Your mother has sent for me<br />in her distress,
844325 847078 and I'm here for a while<br />but not for long.
847203 849330 I'm off to India as a governess
849455 852000 and as I shall be busy preparing<br />for my arduous journey,
852125 856087 I shall require you to be seen<br />and not heard.
856212 858339 Preferably to be not seen<br />and not heard.
858423 861634 Children should be kept<br />in their proper places.
861759 864095 - Do you understand?<br />- Yes, Aunt Emma.
864220 867432 - Yes, Aunt Emma.<br />- Excellent.
867557 869434 You may kiss me<br />if you wish.
876357 878776 # You can hear them sigh<br />and wish to die
878902 880695 # You can see them wink<br />the other eye
880820 884324 # At the man who broke<br />the Bank at Monte Carlo
884407 885408 Altogether now
885533 889370 # As I walked along the Bois Boulogne<br />with an inde... #
889454 893082 I have asked you not to use them utensils<br />in that manner.
893208 895126 I was up at four this morning<br />cleaning them
895251 897837 as if I haven't got enough to do<br />what with the between maid leaving
897962 901174 and now your aunt asking me<br />to heave bloomin' great boxes about
901299 902634 like I was a navvy or something.
902759 904802 - Ruth.<br />- Yes?
904928 908973 There's no need to be so rude.<br />Cook was just trying to cheer us up.
909098 911100 Come on, you two.
915563 917232 Well...
918733 922487 I'm very surprised at you, Cook.<br />Where's your dignity?
922612 924155 And take that silly hat off.
924280 925823 Get yourself dressed properly.
925949 927951 I don't know I seem to do<br />all the work round here.
930161 933039 We shouldn't really Peter,<br />she'll get soaked.
933164 935083 It's too late, she's coming.
936167 937961 Stairs... stairs... stairs...
938086 940004 I'll have fallen arches<br />before me holiday.
940129 942173 I hope you're undressed and ready,<br />master Peter.
942298 943675 I haven't got all night, you know.
943800 946261 - Yes, Ruth.<br />- Good...
950890 952934 You...!
978042 980503 - Oh! Stop it!<br />- You nasty little limb, you!
980628 983089 If you don't mend your ways
983214 987510 you'll go where your precious<br />father's gone, so I tell you straight.
987635 989888 Ruth!
995643 997187 Huh!
1016039 1018333 We're going to have to play<br />at being poor for a while.
1018458 1021920 We're moving to a darling little house<br />in the country, up in Yorkshire.
1022045 1024672 - What?<br />- I know you'll love it
1024797 1029594 - Is Aunt Emma coming?<br />- No, Peter, unfortunately not.
1033598 1036351 - Don't you want a 1st Class, madam?<br />- No, Second. Thank you.
1036476 1038269 Ah, looked like 1st Class quality to me.
1038394 1040438 - Are we on the right train for Yorkshire?<br />- Yes.
1040522 1041523 Thank you.
1081229 1083940 Ooh... careful.<br />Give that to me.
1090321 1094242 - I'll take that bag.<br />- Thank you so much.
1094367 1095869 - Goodbye.<br />- Thank you. Goodbye.
1097370 1098371 Excuse me.
1100748 1103334 We want to go to the house on the hill.<br />The Three Chimneys.
1103459 1106588 - Er, do you know the way?<br />- I daresay.
1106671 1110675 - Well, will you show us?<br />- I dare say.
1120602 1122145 - Phyllis, are you all right?<br />- Yes.
1122270 1124314 Can't we put just one box<br />on your cart?
1124439 1128776 You asked me to show you the way,<br />nothing was said about boxes.
1128902 1131112 Never mind, darlings.<br />It's only a few more yards.
1144626 1147003 I wonder why she didn't leave<br />the lights on.
1147128 1148463 Who is she?
1148588 1151758 Mrs Viney, The woman I engaged<br />to clean the place and to get the supper.
1151883 1154177 I expect Mrs Viney's gone home.
1154302 1156721 Your train was late, see.
1157388 1159182 But she's got the key.<br />What do we do?
1159307 1161643 She'll have left that<br />under the doorstep.
1161726 1165730 - We all do hereabouts.<br />- Well you might have said so.
1165855 1167315 You never asked, did you?
1167440 1169567 Nothing was said<br />about a door key.
1169651 1173404 - May I borrow your lamp, please?<br />- I daresay.
1175365 1179160 If you say "I daresay" once more,<br />I shall have hysterics, I daresay
1181287 1183665 Oh... there we are.
1199055 1200056 What's that?
1203476 1206229 It's only the rats.
1218366 1223830 God works in mysterious ways<br />his wonders to perform.
1232088 1234132 Ow!<br />Rats!
1234257 1238052 I wish we hadn't come.<br />Don't you worry, darlings.
1238178 1243016 I saw a paraffin lamp on the table,<br />we'll soon have some light.
1243141 1246936 Oh, those poor little mice,<br />they were so frightened.
1247061 1250064 I don't believe they were rats at all.
1250982 1254485 You've often said you wanted<br />something to happen, well now it has.
1254611 1256863 It's quite exciting, isn't it?
1256988 1259199 I told Mrs Viney to get<br />some meat and bread
1259365 1262660 and have some supper ready.<br />I wonder where...
1262744 1264746 Oh, I suppose she's laid it<br />in the dining room.
1264871 1267707 Come along darlings, up here.<br />Let's go and see.
1268750 1270210 Come along.
1273588 1277926 Oh darlings, mind the steps.<br />Mind how you go, Peter.
1288770 1290605 Oh, that beastly woman!
1290730 1292732 She's taken the money<br />and not left us any food.
1292815 1295944 Aren't we going to have<br />any supper tonight? I'm starving!
1296069 1298404 I know! There's some food<br />in the cases in the cellar.
1298530 1302367 Aunt Emma sent them on<br />ahead of us. Come along.
1303034 1304661 Mind the step.
1311209 1313169 Come along, Bobbie,<br />it's a real feast.
1313294 1315338 Sardines, biscuits, ginger.
1315463 1316881 Raisins...
1317006 1320218 No Phyl, no! You do not put<br />the marmalade spoon in to the sardines.
1320343 1322053 Oh, Mummy, it's gorgeous, Mummy.
1322178 1324722 Tell you what,<br />let's drink Aunt Emma's health.
1324806 1327433 - Good idea.<br />- Here's to Aunt Emma.
1327559 1329352 - To Aunt Emma.<br />- Aunt Emma.
1329477 1331688 And all who sail in her.
1339112 1341656 - Oh! What's that, Mummy?<br />- Pie.
1341781 1344450 - Pie?<br />- Apple Pie.
1344576 1347203 Apple pie for breakfast?<br />Then we're not poor after all.
1347328 1348997 This is the supper<br />we should have had.
1349122 1351749 I found it in that little room<br />that we thought was a cupboard,
1351833 1354878 so Mrs Viney wasn't so bad<br />after all.
1364262 1367724 - Good morning, can I help you?<br />- I expect so. Viney's the name.
1367849 1370059 Hilda Viney, ma'am... Missus.
1370185 1373313 Do come in.<br />We're just been talking about you.
1373438 1376983 Oh, I see you found your supper then.<br />Funny time to have it though.
1419025 1420735 It was like a great dragon<br />tearing by.
1420860 1423821 A dragon's house<br />looks like that tunnel.
1423905 1426074 I never thought we'd ever get so near<br />to a train as this.
1426199 1429369 - It's better than toy engines, isn't it?<br />- I don't know, it's different.
1429494 1432872 It seems so odd to see all of a train.<br />It's so tall.
1432956 1435333 I've always seen them cut<br />in half by platforms
1435458 1438419 I wonder if that train's going to London?<br />London is where Daddy is.
1438545 1440880 - We don't know that, Phyl.<br />- He might be.
1515246 1516331 How do you do?
1516456 1517457 - How do you do?<br />- Yes.
1517582 1520210 - Could I ask you two questions?<br />- Yes, well it depends what they are.
1520335 1522545 I can't spend all day conversationalising<br />with the junior public.
1522670 1524047 Now what are they?
1524172 1526341 What's the white mark<br />on the coal heap for?
1526466 1529052 That's to tell you how much coal there is<br />you see, in case anybody nicks it.
1529177 1530178 Second question, please.
1530303 1532138 Do you know anything<br />about engines?
1532263 1534015 Do I know anything about engines?<br />Why?
1534140 1536643 - Because I've got one.<br />- Er, what gauge?
1536768 1540146 I don't know anything about gauges,<br />but it's about this big.
1540271 1541272 Yes?
1541397 1543858 - It's brass and it blew up.<br />- It blew up.
1543983 1545985 Well just excuse me young man,<br />I've got a lot to do
1546069 1548446 cos the Station Master's<br />having his hair cut in Leeds, you see
1548571 1549948 and Perks must be about it.
1550031 1554118 - Perks? Who's Perks?<br />- Me, sir. I'm Perks.
1570885 1571970 Right on time.
1572053 1576850 - What is?<br />- This ere's the Scots Flyer.
1588069 1591072 Why is it going so slowly,<br />Mr Perks?
1592699 1597078 Why... well it's all up hill<br />to Scotland, isn't it?
1599664 1601624 That train's going to Scotland.
1601749 1603710 If Daddy's not in London,<br />he's in Scotland
1603835 1605253 and that train is going to Scotland.
1607213 1609257 Perhaps, Phyl.
1613928 1616973 I don't think we're going to enjoy<br />being poor, you know,
1617098 1619350 being cold and all that.
1620935 1624230 Phyllis, try to imagine it<br />as an adventure.
1624355 1627442 All sorts of things might happen.
1627567 1629485 Mother could write about it.
1629611 1632989 Write a book.<br />You never know.
1633114 1636326 We won't always be poor, Phyllis,<br />I'm sure.
1636451 1638745 All right. Good night.
1640705 1642207 Good night.
1645084 1647212 I'm still cold though.
1647337 1650089 ...lightly on the-cheek.
1651799 1656095 ...one of the men, in a bowler hat,<br />opened the door...
1656179 1660600 Father did not turn,<br />but left without a word.
1675031 1677659 Why don't we ask the next train<br />to take our love to Daddy?
1677784 1680578 Trains don't carry people's love,<br />they'd be above that.
1680703 1682288 Yes, they do if you tame them first.
1682413 1684249 I wonder why Daddy<br />hasn't written to us.
1684374 1687168 Mummy says he's too busy.<br />he'll write soon, she says.
1688503 1691130 Well, why don't we wave anyway?<br />Three waves won't matter.
1691214 1693091 We won't miss them.
1716489 1718074 Charming...
1718533 1720076 Charming!
1768208 1769667 About time they had it seen to.
1773463 1775548 The coal in the little shed<br />has held out well, Bobbie.
1775673 1778134 There was hardly any there yesterday<br />when I looked.
1778259 1779594 Well, we've only had one fire.
1779719 1784182 I know but I could swear there's more<br />than when we first came.
1784265 1809457 - That's silly.<br />- Course it's silly.
1809582 1812710 So it's you, Pete.
1812836 1815672 - It's you.<br />- It's me what?
1815797 1818174 It's you that's been putting<br />the coal in the shed.
1818299 1820093 But where from Pete,<br />for heaven's sake?
1820218 1822846 From the coal heap of course,<br />they've got stacks of it there.
1822971 1826808 But that's stealing!<br />Don't you remember your catechism?
1826933 1828726 "Thou shalt not steal sayest the Lord"
1828852 1831104 It wasn't stealing.<br />It was mining.
1831229 1833815 I took from the top.<br />That's mining, not stealing.
1833940 1835942 If it was, all the miners in the world<br />would be in jug.
1836067 1838611 Oh, Pete... Pete!
1838736 1840905 Oh Pete, Pete.
1841030 1842740 We'll have to take it all back.
1842866 1844701 - What?<br />- All of it.
1844826 1846452 - All of it.<br />- All of it!
1846578 1848037 All of it.
1849289 1852333 There can't be anything wrong in trying<br />to keep your own mother warm.
1852417 1853960 That can't be wrong.
1854085 1856337 It's all right Pete,<br />at least we can burn the evidence.
1866806 1868808 Mrs Viney, here we are.<br />I've got the buns for tea.
1868933 1871811 - Buns?<br />- Yes, Mummy sold a story and...
1871936 1873479 Mrs Viney, what's the matter?
1873605 1877275 It's your dear ma, master Peter,<br />she's... she's very poorly.
1877358 1879652 You'd better go back to the village<br />and get Dr Forrest.
1879777 1881613 Right.
1881738 1883615 Don't let her die, Mrs Viney.
1894125 1896085 Doctor Forrest!
1901799 1903801 Mother's very ill,<br />please come quickly,
1903927 1905762 Stay there, my boy.
1935875 1937710 Influenza.
1938378 1940171 But not serious.
1942090 1945677 Now my Lady Grave-airs,<br />I suppose you'll want to be head nurse?
1945802 1947512 - Of course, Doctor.<br />- Right.
1947637 1950139 Now we'll send down some medicine.<br />Keep a good fire going
1950265 1952058 and have some strong beef tea<br />ready to give her
1952183 1954102 the moment the fever goes down...
1954227 1956229 She can have the grapes now<br />and the soda water.
1956354 1958565 Oh, and you'd better get<br />a bottle of brandy.
1958690 1960692 You can go in now...
1961568 1963570 May I have the list?
1966906 1968908 Don't worry, funny face.
1969033 1972120 She's head nurse<br />but you can be Matron.
1972245 1973955 Oh, thank you.
1974080 1977458 Oh, what utter nonsense,<br />I can't afford all that.
1977584 1981254 I haven't an idea in my head<br />for a story
1981379 1984883 so there won't even be buns<br />for tea for some time.
1985008 1990096 Tell Mrs Viney to boil some scrag-end<br />of neck for your dinner tomorrow
1990221 1992390 then I'll have some of the broth.
1993766 1996102 But even if we never have<br />anything to eat at all
1996227 1998271 you can't afford all those other things.
1998396 2002525 Right. So we've got to think<br />of some other way.
2002650 2005028 Now everybody, think.
2005153 2007030 Just as hard as ever you can,
2007155 2008615 think!
2009699 2011701 - I, O, N.<br />- You sure?
2011826 2013286 Yes.
2014579 2016080 I...
2016789 2018291 O...
2021461 2024380 N.<br />There. Brilliant.
2024506 2026090 "Look out at the station. "
2026216 2028760 Definitely one of your best works,<br />Michael Angelo.
2060166 2063294 Oakworth Station!<br />Oakworth!
2064462 2066422 Oakworth!
2068675 2071094 Oakworth Station.
2075348 2077141 Oh, I thought I'd missed you.
2077267 2078977 You are the man who waves to us,<br />aren't you?
2079102 2080562 - Mind the doors, please.<br />- Aren't you?
2080687 2082814 - Yes my dear, I wave...<br />- Oh, will you take this, please.
2082939 2084941 We chose you because we thought<br />you had such a kind face.
2085066 2087944 Er, mind the doors please, Miss.<br />Sir. On the way, Mr, Mitchell.
2088069 2089571 Thank you, Mr Perks.
2161100 2162644 - Good evening.<br />- Good evening.
2162727 2163728 Good evening.
2163853 2168066 Oh dear!<br />Oh! Good evening.
2168191 2170527 The name's Perks.<br />I believe we've met.
2170652 2173446 Yes, you were busy�cause of<br />the Station Master being in Leeds.
2173571 2176241 Yes, even busier now<br />'cause he had a drop too much
2176366 2180662 down at the Britannia Arms and fell over<br />and broke his daft leg playing billiards.
2180745 2182455 - Of course it was his own fault.<br />- Why?
2182580 2184123 He should've used the rest.
2184249 2186084 He will do that<br />over the edge, you see.
2186209 2188503 The old gent asked me<br />to fetch this up straight away.
2188628 2189754 Thank you very much, Mr Perks.
2189879 2192757 I'm very sorry I haven't got two pence<br />to give you like Father does, but...
2192882 2197262 Hey! Just stop that, please.<br />I wasn't thinking about no tuppences.
2197387 2200682 I just came to say I was sorry<br />to hear your mama wasn't so well
2200765 2202642 and to ask how she finds herself<br />this evening.
2203643 2207188 Oh and I've er, I brought her<br />a bit of sweet briar.
2207313 2209232 It's very sweet to smell that is.
2209983 2211025 Tuppence indeed.
2211150 2213695 Thank you very much and I beg<br />your pardon about the twopence.
2213778 2215363 No offences, I'm sure.<br />No offence.
2215488 2217866 And just to show I'll er,<br />I'll have a look
2217991 2220201 at that blown up brass engine<br />of yourn, shall I?
2220326 2222120 - What?<br />- Yes.
2223705 2227208 Oh, can you manage?<br />Bit heavy... Here you are.
2228793 2230712 Oh. Is that it?
2232130 2237635 Bit of a mess, isn't it?<br />Still I'll er, I'll see what I can do.
2237719 2239721 - Good evening.<br />- Thank you, Mr Perks. Good night.
2250273 2253568 - Oh!<br />- Oh, look at that!
2254736 2256821 Oh, everything...
2259324 2261034 "Dear Roberta, Phyllis<br />and Peter,
2261159 2263203 "here are the things you want.
2263328 2265497 "Your mother will want to know<br />where they came from
2265622 2267207 "so please ask her to forgive me
2267332 2270418 "for taking the liberty<br />of allowing myself the great pleasure.
2270543 2274756 "Yours sincerely, G. P... Something. "<br />I can't read it.
2274839 2277425 I think we were right to ask him.
2277550 2279010 Right? Of course we're right.
2279135 2282096 I don't fancy telling Mother<br />the whole truth about this.
2282222 2284516 We shouldn't do that<br />until she's completely well.
2284641 2287018 And when she is, we'll be so happy<br />we shan't mind the fuss.
2287143 2289312 Oh, look at those roses!
2289437 2291814 I'll take them up to her.
2293816 2298196 - And the sweetbriar.<br />- Oh, thank you.
2298321 2300323 Cor, look!<br />I wonder what's in there.
2319551 2322554 So that's an end to it! Now listen.<br />It's true, we're poor,
2322679 2326349 but we shall have enough to live on<br />as long as I have ideas for stories.
2327475 2331604 But you mustn't go about telling people<br />of our affairs. It isn't right!
2331729 2336359 And you must never, never, never<br />ask strangers to give you things.
2336484 2337485 Always remember that.
2337610 2339362 - Yes, Mother.<br />- I shall write to your old gentleman
2339529 2341322 and I shall tell him<br />that I didn't approve.
2341447 2343575 I shall thank him too,<br />of course, for his kindness,
2343700 2347078 but it you that I don't approve of,<br />not the old gentleman.
2347203 2349664 He's been extremely kind.
2349789 2353751 You can give my letter to your Mr Perks<br />to give to him.
2355795 2358339 And we won't say any more about it.
2360175 2362260 Isn't she marvellous<br />when she's angry?
2382655 2383698 Hello, head-nurse.
2383823 2387994 That's funny, I was thinking about you.<br />I wanted to talk to you, Doctor.
2388119 2392207 - Your mother's not worse I hope?<br />- No, but...
2392332 2394876 Come on, we'll go for a ride.
2418900 2420360 This is great fun.
2420485 2423029 Come on, out with it, head-nurse.<br />What's the trouble?
2423154 2427242 It's rather hard, you see, to�out with it'<br />because of what Mother said.
2427367 2428868 What did Mother say?
2428952 2432038 She said I wasn't to go telling everyone<br />that we're poor.
2432163 2436543 - But you aren't everyone, are you?<br />- Not at all. Well?
2436668 2438920 Well, I know doctors<br />are very expensive
2439045 2442549 and Mrs Viney told me that her doctor<br />only cost her twopence a week
2442674 2445510 - because she belonged to a club.<br />- Yes.
2445635 2447595 Well, could we join<br />your club too, please?
2447720 2449764 The same as Mr Viney.
2449889 2451432 You aren't cross with me, are you?
2451558 2454936 Cross? How could I be?<br />You're a very sensible little woman.
2455019 2457647 Now don't you worry.<br />I'll make it all right with your mother,
2457772 2460441 even if I have to make<br />a special brand-new club just for her.
2464112 2465905 Thank you.
2472954 2475415 Bobbie, you're to tidy yourself up<br />in here.
2475540 2477083 Here's a new ribbon for you.
2478251 2480044 There, the surprise is ready.
2480170 2482338 When the bell rings again<br />you can come into the dining room.
2482463 2483965 Come on, Pete.
2489387 2491222 Of course.
2526925 2528801 Happy birthday.
2560917 2562919 Happy birthday, head-nurse.
2572512 2574806 Happy birthday, Miss Roberta.
2581896 2583857 My darling.
2593867 2595869 I helped to make it.
2601207 2604085 Happy birthday, Lanky.
2604169 2608590 # She was beautiful as a butterfly
2608715 2611050 # Proud as a queen
2611134 2614220 # Was pretty little Polly Perkins
2614345 2616931 # Of Paddington Green #
2618057 2620810 - Many happy returns.<br />- Thank you.
2622228 2624105 Lanky indeed!
2625190 2626691 Fatty.
2626816 2629736 - Hope you enjoy the cake.<br />- It's lovely. Thank you very much.
2629861 2633406 - Have a lovely party, my dear.<br />- Thank you for coming.
2634115 2636075 Thank you.
2640997 2643291 Wouldn't Daddy have loved this?
2652550 2654719 Thank you very much,<br />Mrs Waterbury.
2654844 2658306 Good night, good night.
2658431 2662685 Happy birthday!<br />Hey, happy birthday!
2715196 2717657 I hope Mother doesn't get too wet<br />in Wakefield.
2717782 2719576 We don't want her ill again.
2719701 2721202 It's like being in a besieged castle,
2721286 2725206 the arrows of the foe striking<br />against the battlements.
2725290 2728209 No, it's more<br />like a great big garden-squirt.
2728334 2730503 - You're a great big garden squirt<br />- Thank you.
2730628 2732755 Stop it you two!<br />There's a train coming.
2751858 2755153 Oakworth! Oakworth Station!<br />Oakworth!
2755236 2756696 Oakworth Station!
2756821 2758948 Come on. Don't mind the rain,<br />it's only a shower.
2759073 2760074 That's it, thank you.
2760825 2763912 Mind the doors, please.<br />Mind the doors now.
2764037 2765997 Mind the doors, come on.
2766122 2768500 Right away, Mr Mainprice
2770877 2773379 Mother should be on the next train<br />in about fifteen minutes.
2773505 2775840 That one was from London, I think.
2775965 2778218 Hey, there's something going<br />at the end of the station.
2778301 2779844 Yes, something's happened,<br />come on.
2779969 2782514 If you ask me this is a case<br />for the police courts.
2782639 2784641 No, the infirmary more like.
2784766 2787435 Let me pass please, will you?<br />I'll deal with this if you please.
2790313 2793233 - What's he say?<br />- Sounds like French to me.
2793316 2794984 I was in Calais once for a day.
2795109 2799113 - That's not French.<br />- Well what is it then if it's not French?
2799239 2801658 I don't know.<br />It's not French, I know that.
2804285 2807413 No, that's not French.<br />Nothing like it.
2807539 2811125 Try him with French if you know<br />so much then, clever dick.
2811251 2814462 Parlez vous fran�ais, Monsieur?
2814587 2818132 Ah, Dieu merci! Dieu merci!<br />Enfin un amis.
2818258 2821636 Mon petit vous ne soures jamais<br />combien je suis content.
2821761 2824305 - Now that's French.<br />- What's he say?
2824430 2825473 I don't know...
2825598 2827100 Yes, well all right everybody.
2827225 2829644 Keep moving along, please.<br />I'll deal with this. Move along. Thank you.
2831437 2833148 All right now, now, now...<br />Go on.
2833273 2835150 Take him into the waiting room.<br />Mother can talk French.
2835275 2836442 She's on the next train<br />from Wakefield.
2836568 2838611 Right. Come on.
2842031 2844826 He thinks you're a policeman.<br />He thinks you're going to shut him up.
2844951 2847287 I know he does.<br />Look at his eyes.
2847370 2850540 They're like a fox's eyes<br />when the beast is in a trap.
2852750 2856212 Vous attendre.<br />Ma mere parlez fran�ais.
2856337 2858339 Nous...
2858423 2863261 - What's "being kind"?<br />- Er, "bon" is good.
2863344 2866389 Nous sommes bon<br />pour vous, Monsieur.
2873563 2877775 Sorry, Malcolm. I'll see you down at<br />the Fleece later and I'll tell you all about it.
2880195 2883198 C'est bon.<br />Ma mere arrive, c'est bon.
2883323 2884532 Je vous aide.
2884657 2886618 Look I'm not sure<br />we oughtn't to send for police.
2886743 2888536 - Don't!<br />- Oh, don't. Wait till Mummy comes.
2888661 2890622 She speaks French beautifully.<br />You'd love to hear her.
2890747 2893249 I'm sure he hasn't done anything<br />like you're sent to prison for.
2893374 2896711 Yes, well he looks<br />without visible means to me.
2896836 2899380 Still I don't mind waiting<br />till your mama comes.
2899506 2902300 I'd like to know what country<br />has got the credit of him.
2902383 2904677 Look, I've got an idea.<br />Foreign stamps.
2904802 2906221 We'll show them these.
2906346 2911476 Regardes les stamps.<br />Quelle patrie?
2911601 2914395 Ah... Ruskie...
2915438 2917690 - Ruskie.<br />- My lord, he's Russian.
2917816 2919901 Yeah, I-I thought he was.
2927116 2928535 I'll wait here<br />till you bring Mummy in.
2928660 2930203 Not afraid?
2930328 2931663 No.
2934874 2938461 Oakworth Station! Mrs Waterbury,<br />I have something to tell you.
2938586 2941130 - Mummy, we found a Russian.<br />- There's a fellow in there, he's Russian.
2941256 2943174 Close the doors.<br />Right away, Guard!
2943299 2945093 You wouldn't hurt me, would you?
2948972 2952433 Hello, Bobbie.<br />Qui est vous?
2952559 2955854 Madame, je m'appelle Szczepansky.
2956604 2960066 Oh, it's all right.<br />Bobbie go and fetch Doctor Forrest.
2960191 2962443 - We'll take him home with us, Mr Perks.<br />- Thank you, Madam.
2962569 2965822 Come on, help him on the other side.<br />Don't worry.
2965947 2969784 Don't worry, she'll look after you.
2969909 2971286 I knew he was a Russian.
2974747 2975707 Doctor.
2976833 2980211 I need to tell you.<br />Mother's got a very shabby Russian.
2980336 2981796 Your mother's got<br />a very shabby what?
2981921 2985008 He'll have to join your club.<br />I'm certain he hasn't any money.
2985133 2987427 We found him at the station.
2987510 2989679 - Found him? Was he lost then?<br />- Yes, that's what he was.
2989804 2992265 He's been telling Mother<br />life story in French.
2992390 2994350 She said would you please<br />come directly.
2994475 2996060 He's got a nasty cough
2996186 2997604 and he's been crying.
2999314 3000440 Oh, don't smile.
3001316 3002317 Please don't.
3002442 3005153 You wouldn't if you'd seen him.
3005278 3007280 I've never seen a man cry before.
3007405 3010658 Haven't you?<br />I do it all the time.
3061584 3063086 Bobbie!
3063670 3067173 I know you said<br />we weren't to ask any questions
3067298 3070051 but Daddy isn't... isn't dead, is he?
3070176 3073721 Oh, my darling, no.
3073847 3076224 Bobbie, look at me.
3076349 3080061 Daddy was quite, quite well<br />when I heard from him last
3080186 3082313 and he'll come back to us<br />some day.
3089904 3091573 Do tell us about the Russian.
3092198 3096077 That can't make a long story, my darling,<br />because I'm very tired.
3096202 3099831 He's a very clever writer,<br />but in Russia one dare not say
3099956 3102500 anything about the rich people<br />doing wrong
3102584 3104377 or what ought to be done<br />for the poor.
3104502 3106337 If one does, one is sent to prison.
3106462 3109507 Well he wrote a book about it all
3109591 3112260 and he was three years in a dungeon.
3112385 3115597 No light, damp and dreadful.
3115680 3118057 Then they took him out<br />and they sent him to Siberia
3118183 3120518 and he was condemned<br />to stay there for life.
3120602 3124063 - For life? For writing a book?<br />- That's stupid.
3124189 3126483 Go on, Mama.
3126608 3129611 While he was at the mines,<br />some friends got a message to him
3129694 3133239 to say that his wife and children<br />had escaped to England.
3133364 3137869 So after many adventures he too escaped<br />and came here to look for them.
3137994 3141748 - Do you think he will find them?<br />- Oh, I do hope so.
3142582 3144959 I think my darlings, in your prayers<br />you might ask God
3145084 3148796 to show his pity<br />upon all prisoners and captives.
3149631 3152884 To show his pity<br />upon all prisoners and captives?
3154511 3157639 Yes, darling.<br />Upon all the prisoners and captives.
3169943 3171486 Merci.
3177408 3180286 He seemed pleased. I wish we could think<br />of other things to give him.
3180411 3181996 What about strawberries?
3182121 3185583 Perks promised me some<br />from his own garden ages ago.
3210692 3212110 Look at that tree over there!
3216698 3218199 Lor, it's moving!
3220493 3221786 So are the others...
3225957 3227959 It's magic.
3228084 3233464 What is it?
3237385 3241472 It's much too magic for me.<br />I don't like it, I'm going home.
3268166 3270460 Cor, that'll take some sweeping up.
3290897 3293024 Hey! The 11:29 down<br />hasn't gone by yet.
3293149 3295276 We must let them know at the station,<br />there'll be an accident.
3295401 3296653 - Let's run!<br />- No, come back.
3296778 3298613 It's too late, it's two miles away.
3298738 3302283 - We do something to the telegraph wires.<br />- But we don't know how.
3307372 3309999 If we only had something red, we could<br />go down on to the line and wave it.
3310124 3312752 But the train wouldn't see us till it came<br />round the corner. That's too late.
3312836 3314671 We could go round<br />and wave to the train.
3314796 3316339 We might wave anyway.
3316464 3319759 No. They'd only think it was us as usual,<br />we've waved so often before.
3319843 3321845 - Flannel petticoats!<br />- I beg your pardon?
3321970 3325139 - Flannel petticoats.<br />- Of course! Take them off.
3337485 3340405 - Now.<br />- You're not going to tear them, Pete?
3340530 3343408 - Oh, shut up<br />- Yes, tear them into little bit if you like.
3343533 3347412 If we can't stop the train,<br />there'll be an accident with people killed.
3347537 3349330 Now sticks, come on.
3372020 3375106 - I'll have two. It was my idea.<br />- They're our petticoats!
3375231 3378693 What's it matter who waves what<br />if we can only stop the train.
3383114 3384949 Stand firm and wave like mad.
3388453 3389871 Keep off the line, Bobbie.
3393208 3395460 They won't see us.<br />It's all no good.
3397253 3400173 - Stand off the line, Bobbie.<br />- It's all no good.
3400298 3405136 - Stand back!<br />- Not yet. Not yet!
3408181 3410058 - Stop!<br />- Stop!
3411893 3412894 Stop!
3424531 3426783 - Stand back.<br />- Stop!
3426908 3428868 Stop!
3428952 3430912 - Stop!<br />- Stop!
3430995 3434415 Stop.
3436626 3438461 Stop...
3439671 3441005 Stop.
3445593 3449180 Stop. There's been an earthquake.<br />Don't move you'll all be killed.
3449305 3454227 The trees are walking down the bank<br />and there's a mountain of great stones.
3469284 3472954 We'll have a look at this earthquake<br />then get back to the train.
3475665 3478001 Bobbie.
3478126 3481546 Ladies and gentlemen, I think<br />you'll agree with me that we have three
3481671 3487510 charming children here<br />who are indeed an example to us all.
3490972 3493224 All right chaps, this is it.
3493349 3495477 One, two, three.
3502859 3507614 ...I have learned<br />in the short time I have seen them
3507739 3510033 to look forward to knowing them better.
3510158 3512577 If I had to rename the Waterbury children,
3512702 3517248 I would call them<br />the Three Saviours of the Steel Road
3517373 3518791 or perhaps the Railway Children.
3518917 3523338 And now my dears, from the directors<br />of the Northern and Southern Railway
3523463 3528510 in grateful recognition<br />of a courageous and brave action
3528635 3530762 which averted an accident
3530887 3534516 on August 15th, 1905.
3534641 3536684 Oh, thank you.
3555787 3558331 It's your turn now.<br />Just begin with "Ladies and gentlemen".
3558456 3561918 - Oh, lor!<br />- No, "Ladies and gentlemen".
3562043 3564087 Ladies and gentlemen...
3565129 3566756 Ladies and gentlemen,
3566881 3570802 we shall treasure these watches<br />for the rest of our lives.
3570927 3573930 What I mean to say is,<br />thank you all very much indeed.
3578560 3580311 One, two.
3595827 3598371 You must be very proud,<br />Mrs Waterbury.
3598496 3601040 And er, this is from me.
3647545 3651299 It was a wonderful day, wasn't it?<br />The kind that very seldom happens.
3651424 3654969 But I did so want to talk to<br />the old gentleman about something else.
3655094 3656679 What did you want<br />to say to him?
3656804 3659599 I'll tell you,<br />I've written him a letter.
3662185 3665647 "My dearest old gentleman,<br />I want to ask you something, please.
3665772 3668858 "If you get out of the train<br />and go by the next it would do.
3668983 3672695 "I do not want you to give me anything -<br />Mother says we ought not to.
3672821 3677659 "Besides, we only want to talk to you<br />about a prisoner and captive.
3677784 3679202 "Your loving friend, Bobbie. "
3679327 3682288 Very good.<br />Yes, it is.
3694384 3699222 My heart's thumping like a steam engine,<br />right under my sash, too.
3699347 3701307 People's hearts<br />aren't under their sashes.
3701432 3702934 I don't care, mine is.
3703059 3706813 If you're going to talk like a poetry book,<br />my heart's in my mouth.
3706938 3709357 My heart's in my boots<br />if it comes to that.
3709482 3711860 - He'll think we're idiots.<br />- He won't be far wrong.
3711985 3714654 Oakworth!
3717574 3720410 - Morning, sir.<br />- Good morning, Perks.
3721327 3725331 - Hello. This is a very great pleasure.<br />- It was good of you to get out.
3725456 3728209 Er, may I extend a cordial invitation<br />to the use of my room, sir?
3728334 3729335 - Thank you.<br />- Right away, sir.
3729460 3731713 - Right away, Mr Mitchell.<br />- Thank you, Mr Perks.
3731838 3734507 If you'd care to follow me, sir<br />just along here.
3741472 3743725 - Nice and tidy for you sir.<br />- Ah, thank you, Perks.
3743850 3746895 - I'll leave you to it then, sir.<br />- Thank you.
3748855 3750356 Well?
3753026 3755987 Well?<br />What is it?
3758823 3761618 - Oh, please...<br />- Yes?
3761743 3764746 - What I mean to say is...<br />- Yes?
3764871 3769000 - I wish I might say something.<br />- I wish you would say something.
3769125 3772128 Well then... it's about our Russian.
3772837 3774547 - Captive.<br />- A captive.
3774672 3778092 We want more than anything in the world<br />to find his wife and children for him.
3778218 3779344 Only we don't know how.
3780178 3782972 - What did you say his name was?<br />- I'll write it for you.
3785642 3789020 Um, would you have a pencil<br />and the back of an envelope?
3789145 3791439 Here, write it here.
3797862 3802408 This is how you write it.<br />You say... Szczepansky.
3808748 3812377 That man?<br />Bless my soul...
3812502 3813837 I've read his book.
3813962 3818091 So your mother took him in<br />like the good Samaritan.
3818216 3821427 I'll tell you what, youngsters,<br />your mother must be a very good woman.
3822387 3824764 - Yes, she is.<br />- And you're a good man.
3824889 3827100 You flatter me.
3827225 3829853 Now am I to tell you<br />what I think of you?
3829978 3831521 - Oh, please don't.<br />- Why?
3833314 3835108 I don't know why exactly,
3835233 3837610 only if it's something horrid<br />I don't want you to.
3839195 3841656 And if it's something nice<br />I'd rather you didn't.
3841781 3845577 Then all I will say is that I'm very glad<br />you came to me about all this,
3845702 3847245 very glad indeed.
3847328 3850623 And I shouldn't be surprised<br />if I don't find out something very soon.
3850748 3852959 Well now tell me something<br />about yourselves.
3853918 3854919 Tea first.
3872645 3874230 Who on earth?
3876733 3878735 Let's go and see.
3882113 3884491 - Hello.<br />- Hello.
3884616 3886951 Hello.<br />Good news, my dears.
3887076 3889621 I've found your Russian friend's<br />wife and children.
3889746 3891539 - Oh!<br />- And I couldn't resist
3891664 3895293 the temptation of having the pleasure<br />of telling him
3895376 3897670 No, you tell him, my dear.
3899714 3902717 And the other two<br />will show me the way.
3907138 3911893 Mother, Mr Szczepansky's wife<br />and children have been found.
3920652 3923112 - Goodbye.<br />- Goodbye, sir.
3923238 3925156 Goodbye.
3927283 3929661 - Right away, Mr Mitchell.<br />- Thank you, Mr Perks.
3929786 3931079 Goodbye.
3933206 3934666 Excellent.
3939796 3942090 - Bye.<br />- Goodbye.
3960316 3964612 Ah! There, that's a likely<br />little brooch that.
3964737 3968283 I don't know as ever I seen a thing<br />more like a buttercup,
3968408 3970118 without it were a buttercup.
3970243 3972203 Mother gave it to me<br />for my birthday.
3972328 3975331 Oh, is that it?<br />I didn't see it close to.
3975456 3978585 It highly decorative that,<br />thank you.
3978710 3981796 - When's your birthday, Mr Perks?<br />- My birthday?
3981921 3984132 I gave up keeping my birthday<br />afore you lot were born.
3984257 3986593 But you must have been born<br />sometime, you know.
3986718 3990263 Even if it was 20 years ago<br />or 30 years ago or 60 or 70.
3990388 3993475 Yeah, well it weren't quite<br />so long as that.
3995518 3998104 If you really want to know,
3998229 4000773 it's my 42 years<br />come the 15th of this month.
4000899 4002025 Why don't you keep it then?
4002150 4004110 I've got other things to keep<br />besides birthdays.
4004235 4007071 Oh what?<br />Not secrets, Mr Perks.
4007197 4009824 No, the kids and bloomin' missus.
4018291 4021127 I've sold another story, darlings,<br />the one about the King of the Mussels
4021252 4022587 so there'll be buns for tea.
4022712 4024672 You can go and got them<br />the moment they're ready.
4024797 4029093 Would you mind if we didn't them tonight,<br />but on the 15th? That's next Thursday.
4029219 4031095 I don't mind, darling,<br />but why?
4032013 4034307 Well, it's Mr Perks' birthday,<br />he's 42.
4034432 4037435 He says he doesn't keep his birthday<br />any more, he's got other things to keep.
4037519 4041564 Not rabbits and secrets,<br />but the kids and the bloomin' missus.
4041689 4044567 - His wife and children, Bobbie.<br />- It's the same thing, isn't it?
4044692 4047403 Bloomin' missus is sort of a germ<br />of endearment, isn't it?
4047529 4049864 - Term of endearment, Phyl.<br />- Yes.
4049989 4052033 We thought we'd make<br />a nice birthday for him.
4052158 4053493 He's been very nice to us.
4053576 4056287 And we agreed that next bun day<br />we'd ask if we could.
4056412 4059415 It would be rather nice to write his name<br />on the buns in pink sugar, wouldn't it?
4059541 4063086 - Perks isn't a very pretty name.<br />- Albert's his other name, I asked once.
4063211 4064712 I think Albert's a pretty name.
4068216 4069926 What's the matter with that?
4072011 4074013 What about flowers?
4074139 4076641 He's got lots of flowers of his own,<br />hasn't he?
4076766 4079561 Yes, but it's always nice<br />to be given them.
4079644 4081563 Let's all just sit and think.
4081688 4086025 No one's to speak<br />until they've thought of something.
4092323 4093825 - I've got it.<br />- What?
4093950 4097162 - Perks is so nice to everyone, right?<br />- Right.
4097287 4100665 So there must be lots of people<br />who'd like to help make him a birthday.
4100790 4103418 Mother said<br />we weren't to ask people for things.
4103543 4105628 For ourselves, she meant,<br />not for other people.
4105753 4107463 I think we should ask Mummy first.
4107589 4110008 There's no harm in it,<br />it depends how you do it.
4110133 4113219 I only hope Mr Perks won't be offended<br />and think it's charity.
4113344 4115096 Poor people can be very proud,<br />you know.
4115221 4117974 It's not because he's poor,<br />it's because we're fond of him.
4118099 4120435 All right, I'll look out some things<br />that Phyllis has outgrown.
4120560 4123897 - Will that do?<br />- I'm sure he'd love that.
4124022 4126024 Come back tomorrow<br />and I'll see what I can do.
4126149 4127942 - Oh, thank you, goodbye.<br />- Goodbye.
4128067 4129194 Thank you, bye bye.
4129319 4131946 I've always liked Mrs Ransome.
4132071 4135074 - Oh, thank you.<br />- Of course.
4136784 4138620 Thank you very much.<br />Goodbye.
4138745 4140622 Bye!
4145168 4148379 <i>Some people were kind<br />and some were crusty</i>
4148505 4150340 <i>and some would give<br />some would not.</i>
4150465 4153176 It's Mr Perks' birthday on Thursday,<br />would you like to give him a present?
4153301 4157806 - No, I would not. I hate the man.<br />- Thank you!
4157931 4159390 That was pretty rude.
4159974 4164062 <i>It's rather difficult work<br />asking for things, even for other people.</i>
4164187 4166189 <i>as you've no doubt found<br />if you've ever tried it.</i>
4166314 4169359 Tobacco pipe,<br />half a pound of tea.
4169484 4173655 - Woollen scarf from the Drapers.<br />- A stuffed squirrel from Doctor Forrest.
4173780 4176866 There it is, you can have it<br />and good riddance to it.
4176991 4179035 - Oh!<br />- Thank you.
4182038 4184374 - Bye.<br />- Goodbye.
4189838 4192298 Thank you, Mr James,<br />he'll love that.
4192423 4194425 Goodbye.
4211192 4213278 Hello?
4213403 4216072 Hello, is anyone at home?
4216197 4218616 Me Mam's upstairs,<br />a- changing herself.
4218741 4220451 Mam, visitors!
4220577 4223705 Thank you Patrick,<br />just coming.
4225623 4227750 I'm a bit late changing, Miss,
4227876 4230295 owing to me having had<br />an extra clean up today
4230420 4233006 along with Perks happening to say<br />it's his birthday.
4233131 4235675 I don't know what put such an idea<br />into his head.
4235758 4237969 We keeps the children's birthdays,<br />of course,
4238094 4241431 but him and me... Well, we've no time<br />for suchlike as a general rule.
4241556 4244559 We know it was his birthday<br />and we've brought him some presents.
4244684 4247520 Oh, bring them in my dears.
4256488 4259491 Oh, don't, please don't,<br />Mrs Perks.
4259657 4260742 Whatever is the matter?
4260825 4263119 Do you mean to say<br />you don't like the things we brought?
4263244 4264329 Don't you like them?
4264454 4267874 Oh, there, there, don't mind me,<br />I'm all right.
4267999 4272378 Like them? Why it's a birthday<br />such as Perks never had,
4272504 4274172 not even when he were a boy.
4274297 4275798 Good, I'm glad you're pleased.
4275924 4277800 Could we wait and see<br />if Mr Perks is pleased too?
4277926 4279761 I won't say another word.
4279886 4282388 Could we have a plate for the buns,<br />Mrs Perks?
4282514 4284015 Oh, of course.
4284140 4286142 Fit for a prince, I'd say.
4286267 4290522 I never thought there'd be more for him,<br />except the ounce of his backie.
4290647 4294651 # I'm feeling right today
4294776 4297111 # Been a lovely day... #
4301491 4303993 Bless us, he's early.
4304118 4306162 Let's hide in there<br />and you tell him about it
4306287 4308456 but give him the tobacco first<br />as you got it for him.
4308581 4311209 When you've told him,<br />we'll shout "Many Happy Returns".
4315547 4317215 - How do.<br />- How do.
4318883 4320718 Hello, old woman.
4324806 4328268 - Well here's a pretty set out.<br />- It's your birthday tea, Bert.
4330395 4334566 And here's an ounce<br />of your extra particular.
4334691 4338319 Yes, she's a good old girl.
4338444 4341114 Eh, what's that pram doing here?<br />Hey, you're not...?
4344200 4347453 Well, what's all these bundles?<br />Eh?
4347579 4350206 And what's all this sweet stuff and...?
4351583 4354752 What's this squirrel<br />doing on the table, eh?
4355837 4359591 Oh, lor!<br />Whatever should we do?
4360383 4362844 I've forgotten to put the labels<br />on any of the things.
4362927 4365180 He won't know what's from whom.
4365305 4366639 He'll think it's all from us
4366764 4369851 and that we're trying to be grand and<br />charitable or something horrid like that.
4369976 4371019 Ssh, be quiet!
4371144 4373396 I don't care. I won't stand it.<br />I tell you straight.
4373521 4376191 But, it's them children<br />you make such a fuss about,
4376316 4377859 the children from the Three Chimneys.
4377942 4381404 I don't care,<br />not if it was angels from heaven.
4381529 4383615 We got on all right all these years<br />and no favours asked.
4383740 4386242 I'm not having these charity<br />goings-on at my time of life.
4386367 4387869 And don't you think it, Nell.
4387952 4390622 Ssh, Bert, shut your silly tongue,<br />for goodness sake.
4390747 4393917 All three of�em is in the other room<br />a- listening to every word you speaks.
4394042 4395960 I'll give them something to listen to.
4396085 4398296 I've spoke my mind to these afore<br />and I'll do it again. Come out.
4398421 4400256 Come on out!<br />Out here, come on.
4400381 4401966 No, not you lot, you stop in...
4402091 4404636 Sophie, look put some pants<br />on Benjamin, we've got company.
4408765 4411142 Right, you can tell me<br />what you mean by it.
4411267 4414604 Have I ever complained of being short<br />as you starts this charity with me?
4414729 4417106 We thought you'd be so pleased,<br />Mr Perks.
4417232 4419818 I'll never try and be kind to anyone else<br />as long as I live.
4419943 4422654 - No, I won't. Not never!<br />- We didn't mean any harm.
4422779 4424489 It isn't what you means<br />so much as what you does.
4424614 4427534 We thought you'd love it.<br />We always have things on our birthdays.
4427659 4429160 Oh ay, from your own relations,<br />that's different.
4429285 4430662 No, not just our relations.
4430787 4432288 They're from all sorts of people<br />in the village.
4432413 4434707 - And who put'em up to it, I'd like to know.<br />- We did.
4444884 4449013 So you've been telling the neighbours<br />that we can't make both ends meet.
4450140 4452892 Now you've disgraced us as deep<br />as you can in the neighbourhood,
4452976 4455812 you can take that pack of tricks<br />back where it came from.
4455937 4458523 I'm very much obliged, I'm sure.
4458648 4461484 I don't doubt that you meant it kind
4461609 4465530 but I'd rather not be acquainted with you<br />any longer, if it's all the same to you.
4468908 4471369 Look here.<br />We'll go if you like
4471494 4474164 and you needn't be friends with us<br />any more, but...
4474289 4477125 We'll always be friends with you,<br />even though you're nasty to us.
4477250 4481379 But before we go, let us show you<br />these labels to put on the things.
4481504 4482964 I don't want to see no labels
4483047 4485341 except proper luggage labels<br />in me own walk of life.
4485466 4488970 - Please let Bobbie show you the labels.<br />- All right, go on.
4489053 4491931 We wrote down everything<br />everybody said
4492015 4494517 when they gave us the things<br />with the people's names on.
4494642 4497645 Because Mother said<br />that we ought to be careful because...
4497770 4499439 Well I wrote down what she said<br />and you'll see.
4499606 4500607 That's from Mother.
4500732 4504027 She thought Mrs Perks might like<br />some of Phyllis' things.
4505111 4508072 "I can't do much... "
4512285 4516998 Well that's all right.<br />I mean, your ma's a born lady.
4517123 4519083 We'll keep the little frocks<br />and what-not, Nell.
4519209 4520293 Yes, Albert.
4520418 4524047 Then there's the perambulator<br />and the gooseberries and sweets.
4524172 4525548 They're from Mrs Ransome.
4525673 4529761 I can't send the pram back, Bert,<br />and I won't so don't ask me.
4529886 4531679 I'm not asking anything.
4531805 4534474 Then there's the shovel.<br />Mr James made that for you himself
4534599 4536476 and he says...
4536601 4538353 Oh, where is it?<br />Oh, yes, here.
4538478 4541272 - No er, you can read it.<br />- He says,
4541397 4545819 "You tell Mr Perks it is a pleasure<br />to make a little trifle for a man
4545944 4548029 "as is so much respected. "
4548154 4550198 He's a good chap, that.
4551199 4553076 He's a very good chap, that.
4553952 4555578 He's not bad at all, that chap.
4555703 4557831 And everybody who gave anything<br />said they liked you
4557956 4559916 and thought it was<br />a very good idea of ours.
4560041 4565588 And nobody said anything about charity<br />or anything horrid like that.
4565713 4568925 We thought that you'd love to know<br />how fond everybody is of you.
4570510 4573596 And I've never so unhappy<br />in all my born days.
4573721 4575181 Goodbye.<br />Come on.
4577142 4578143 Stop!
4581729 4585859 I take back every word I've said<br />contrary to what you'd wish.
4585984 4587610 - Nell?<br />- Yes, Albert.
4587735 4589154 Put the kettle on.
4589279 4591865 We'll take away the things<br />if you're unhappy with them.
4591990 4593116 I'm not unhappy about�em.
4594450 4596619 I don't know<br />if I was ever better pleased.
4596744 4600123 ...Not so much with the presents<br />though frankly they're an A. 1 collection
4600248 4602167 but the kind respect<br />of our neighbours.
4602292 4605628 - That's worth having, eh Nell?<br />- I think it's all worth having...
4605753 4608965 And you've made a most ridiculous fuss<br />about nothing, Bert, if you ask me.
4609090 4610466 No, I haven't.
4610592 4612886 If a man didn't respect himself,<br />no one wouldn't do it for him.
4613011 4615638 But everyone respects you.<br />They all said so.
4615763 4618224 We knew you'd like it<br />once you understood.
4620518 4624522 Well you'll stay to tea, I take it?
4624647 4626774 May the garland of friendship<br />be ever green.
4626900 4629652 May our garland of friendship<br />be ever green, Mr Perks.
4629777 4631905 Hear, hear!
4632030 4633990 Oh, well that's all right then, isn't it?
4634115 4637494 Let's have a look at them buns<br />you brought in. Where are they?
4637619 4639954 Who wrote that?<br />It's Albert.
4640079 4641664 Holy Mary, Mother of God
4641789 4645835 pray for us sinners now<br />and at the hour of our death. Amen.
4650516 4654478 Now go to sleep all of you<br />and not another word.
4660150 4663070 - Good night.<br />- Good night, Mum.
4663153 4666365 Yeah they're jolly good<br />little kids, those Waterburys.
4666490 4668867 Oh, they're all right,<br />bless their hearts.
4668992 4672037 It's you that's the aggravatingest old thing<br />that ever was.
4672162 4674373 - I was ashamed of you, I tell you.<br />- You needn't be.
4674498 4677626 I climbed down handsome<br />as soon as I understood it weren't charity.
4677751 4680379 Charity's one thing I never could abide,<br />and won't neither.
4680504 4683340 - Go to sleep, Albert.<br />- Yes, dear.
4684174 4686635 I tell you this though,
4686760 4689012 it isn't what you does<br />so much as what you means,
4689138 4690973 that's what I say.
4691098 4693934 - Now if it had been charity...<br />- Oh, drat charity, Bert.
4694059 4697938 Nobody won't offer you charity<br />however much you was to want it.
4698063 4701150 That were just friendliness,<br />that were.
4701233 4704987 I reckon it's what people call<br />loving kindness.
4705112 4708073 - Now go to sleep, Bert.<br />- Yes dear, good night.
4708198 4711368 Good night, Bert.<br />Happy Birthday.
4723672 4725215 Nell?
4727092 4730220 Oh, all right, Bert,<br />as it's your birthday.
4761251 4763295 Hello, my dears.
4763420 4765380 Hard at it, are yer?
4765506 4767883 Yeah. Well, er... Yeah.
4768008 4770010 One good turn deserves another,<br />that's what I always say.
4770177 4771428 Hello, Mr Perks,<br />how do mean?
4771553 4775599 Well I found these magazines, you see,<br />in the waiting room.
4775724 4777434 I was cleaning up.
4777559 4781063 They were in a cupboard and well<br />they're only collecting dust and...
4781188 4783607 Dust is, as you know, unhygienic.
4783732 4784733 - Hello.<br />- Hello.
4784858 4787194 I thought perhaps<br />you might like them.
4787277 4790697 There's a lot of pictures in�em.<br />and that,
4790823 4792825 and you can colour�em up<br />with chalks and that.
4792950 4794076 Anyway I don't want�em.
4794201 4795911 - You're a dear.<br />- Yes, you are.
4797246 4800499 - Hear, hear!<br />- Well, that's all right then.
4800624 4802918 I must be getting along.<br />I've got lots to do.
4803043 4804753 Perks must be about it.
4804878 4807589 Thank you.<br />That was very kind of him.
4809049 4810801 We'd better go inside,<br />it's going to rain.
4840622 4841582 Daddy...
4877075 4880037 - Where's Bobbie?<br />- I thought I heard her upstairs.
4880162 4884041 She knows it's tea time.<br />I wonder if she's all right.
4886752 4904228 Bobbie?
4907356 4908899 What is it darling?
4910943 4911985 Oh, Mummy!
4926416 4927960 You don't believe Daddy did it?
4928085 4930546 - No.<br />- Because it's not true.
4930671 4933966 They have shut him in prison,<br />but he's done nothing wrong.
4934091 4937177 He's good and honourable<br />and he belongs to us.
4938262 4941765 Will it make you very unhappy<br />if you tell me all about it?
4941890 4943350 I want to understand.
4949231 4952734 Do you remember the day<br />those two men took Daddy away?
4953694 4954695 Yes, I do.
4954820 4959074 Well they arrested him, charging him<br />with selling State secrets
4959199 4962202 with being, in fact,<br />a spy and a traitor.
4964163 4966999 How could anyone believe that?
4967124 4969334 How could anyone do such a thing?
4969459 4971170 Someone did.
4972254 4975674 Why didn't you tell someone,<br />a lawyer?
4976633 4980971 There wasn't anyone who could<br />hurt Daddy on purpose, was there?
4981096 4985017 I don't know.<br />It's all so complicated.
4985934 4989855 There was a man in the office<br />who was very envious of your father.
4989980 4992691 Daddy always said<br />he didn't quite trust him.
4993442 4995402 Why didn't you explain<br />all that to someone?
4995486 4997779 No one would listen.
4997905 5000782 Do you suppose<br />I haven't tried everything?
5000908 5004661 No, my darling,<br />what we have to do, you and I,
5004786 5008081 and Daddy, is to be brave.
5056213 5057506 Where have you been?
5058549 5060050 Where have I been?
5060175 5062177 Down to the station.<br />Don't ask why, it's a secret.
5062302 5063428 Oh, please yourself.
5063554 5066515 - There's a paper chase tomorrow.<br />- Oh, whoopee!
5066598 5068016 - Who?<br />- The grammar school boys.
5068142 5069059 Oh zippee!
5069184 5071228 Perks says we can see them<br />going along by the line.
5071353 5072688 Oh really?
5074064 5075816 What's a paper chase?
5092875 5094418 Let me pass please
5099256 5102176 Hey! That's against by-laws.
5102301 5105471 - I ought to report him.<br />- They're only having fun.
5105596 5109475 Passengers is forbidden to cross the line<br />on any pretence.
5109600 5112895 He ain't no passenger.<br />He's out of sight now, anyway.
5113020 5117524 What the eye don't see the heart need<br />take no notice of, that what I always say.
5118609 5120611 Come on then.
5121403 5123864 He's gone in the tunnel.
5123989 5125866 Oh, it is dark in here.
5133624 5135626 They don't know<br />what they're in for.
5135751 5137461 It isn't easy running in the dark.
5137586 5140464 They'll take a long time<br />going through, won't they?
5140589 5142299 Aye, they will that.
5150724 5153101 - They went that way.<br />- Oh thanks!
5154478 5157231 I know! Let's cut across to the top<br />and see them come out the other end.
5157356 5159441 - We'll be there before they are.<br />- Good idea.
5159566 5161026 Yes, good idea!
5199189 5203485 - This way!<br />- No, this way. Come on, quick.
5212327 5213704 There, that's all.
5213787 5215205 What should we do now?
5215330 5217416 Not yet,<br />there's one in a red jersey.
5217541 5219168 He hasn't come out yet.
5220210 5222171 Come on, let's go to the tunnel mouth
5222296 5225007 and perhaps we can see him<br />from the inside.
5236935 5238604 It's dark in there.
5238729 5241148 - Don't worry, Phyl. I'll protect you.<br />- I don't like it.
5242524 5245319 Still no sign of him. I reckon<br />he must have had an accident.
5245444 5248113 Let's go and rescue him.<br />Come on.
5248238 5250115 Come on, Phyl.<br />Keep close behind me.
5250240 5252242 If a train comes along<br />get flat against the tunnel wall
5252367 5254036 and hold your skirts against you.
5254161 5255496 I still don't like it.
5265756 5269218 - I want to go back.<br />- Ssh, don't be silly. What is that?
5269343 5270761 It's another earthquake!
5286777 5289613 - It's a train.<br />- Oh, let me go back!
5289780 5291865 Don't be a coward, it's quite safe.<br />Stand back.
5291990 5293826 Come in, come on.
5316098 5318350 It is a dragon.<br />I always thought it was.
5331572 5332739 Come on.
5332823 5335450 Supposing that boy<br />was caught underneath the train...
5335576 5337786 - Oh!<br />- We've got to go and see.
5337870 5340330 Can't we go and get someone<br />from the station?
5340455 5342624 - Phyl, you wait here.<br />- No.
5342749 5347546 Hello?
5349423 5351842 Hey you two, come quickly!
5353302 5356889 Oh, is that blood?<br />Is that red blood?
5357014 5360017 - Is he all killed?<br />- Phyllis, please.
5360142 5362853 Hurry up you two, get help.
5376158 5380037 "It was on a hot summer's afternoon... "
5380162 5385501 Oh, do come down, we've found a hound<br />in a red jersey and he's broken his leg.
5385626 5387711 They're bringing him here,<br />I've sent for Doctor Forrest.
5387836 5390506 But you should send for a vet,<br />I can't have a lame dog here.
5390631 5392633 Oh, he's not a dog, it's a boy.
5392758 5394760 Well then he ought to be taken<br />to his mother.
5394885 5397971 His mother's dead,<br />his father's in Northumberland.
5398096 5399973 Oh, Mother, you will be nice to him,<br />won't you?
5400098 5402434 I told him I was sure you'd want us<br />to have him here.
5402559 5405771 - You always want to help everybody.<br />- Come along.
5415656 5417449 I'm glad you brought him here.
5417574 5421078 - Let's get him to bed.<br />- It will hurt a bit, won't it?
5421203 5426500 I hope you don't think I'm a coward if<br />I faint again. I don't do this on purpose.
5426625 5428293 I don't want to cause you<br />any more trouble.
5428418 5432673 Don't you worry, you're the one<br />who's got the trouble.
5432798 5435467 We'd love to have you here,<br />wouldn't we, Bobbie?
5435592 5437010 Yes.
5440305 5443016 That will be Doctor Forrest.<br />I'll go.
5452943 5456446 - That's not the doctor.<br />- I know.
5456572 5458782 I know that voice though,<br />at least I think I do.
5458907 5463120 I thought I recognised it too.<br />It's not the doctor, that's for sure.
5466290 5469960 Could it be that Doctor Forrest<br />has been attacked by highwaymen
5470085 5472629 and left for dead and this is the man<br />they've telegraphed
5472754 5475299 - to take his place?<br />- Perhaps he's gone mad.
5475424 5478051 Perhaps he's caught something awful<br />from one of his patients
5478177 5479636 and that man's come to tell her.
5479761 5481805 Nonsense. Mother wouldn't take the man<br />up into Jim's bedroom.
5481930 5483432 Why should she?
5483557 5486435 Listen.<br />The door's opening.
5496612 5498280 Now they'll come down.
5498405 5500365 It's rude to listen like this.
5500491 5504328 It's not listening, nobody in their senses<br />would talk secrets on the stairs.
5504453 5506163 Bobbie?
5506288 5508999 A relative of Jim's has come,<br />he wants to see you.
5509082 5510000 Wash your hands and faces.
5510125 5512002 We'll be in the dining room<br />when you're ready.
5512085 5513086 Yes, Mama.
5515339 5518592 There now!<br />Fancy not thinking of that, hm?
5518717 5521970 - Any hot water, Mrs Viney?<br />- Righto love.
5527851 5530229 You all right?<br />There we are, that's it.
5533440 5535108 Well I never did!
5535234 5537736 This, my dears,<br />is Jim's grandfather.
5537861 5541073 Our own old gentleman!<br />I'm so awfully glad it's you.
5541198 5544034 When I just think of all<br />the old gentlemen there are in the world
5544117 5545869 it could have been anyone.
5545994 5547871 You're not going to take<br />Jim away though, are you?
5547996 5549081 Not at present.
5549206 5552251 Your mother has most kindly consented<br />to let him stay here.
5552376 5556713 I thought of sending a nurse but your<br />mother said she'd nurse him herself.
5556839 5559925 But we won't have anything to eat<br />if Mother doesn't write.
5560050 5561969 That's all right, Peter.
5562052 5563762 I see you trust your children.
5563887 5566849 - Of course.<br />- Then I may tell them our arrangement.
5566974 5568517 Sit down, my dears.
5570894 5575065 Your Mother, my dears, has consented<br />to give up her writing for a while
5575190 5577317 and to become<br />a matron of my hospital.
5577442 5580028 Does that mean we'll have to leave<br />Three Chimneys and the railways?
5580112 5582531 No, no, my darling. No.
5582656 5585242 The hospital is here.
5585367 5589997 The Three Chimneys Hospital<br />and my unlucky Jim is the only patient.
5590080 5593458 - Will Mother go on writing again?<br />- We shall see...
5593584 5595627 Perhaps something nice will happen<br />and she won't have to.
5595752 5597671 - But I like my writing.<br />- I know.
5597796 5601633 Don't be afraid I'm going to try<br />and interfere but one never know.
5601758 5604803 Very beautiful and wonderful things<br />do happen, don't they?
5604928 5609183 And we live most of our lives<br />in the hope of them.
5616482 5619818 I got your letter my dear,<br />but it wasn't needed.
5619943 5624323 When I read about your father's case<br />in the papers at the time I had my doubts.
5624448 5628243 And ever since I've known who you were,<br />I've been trying to find out things
5628368 5630537 and I have hopes.
5630662 5633832 - Oh...<br />- Yes, I may say, great hopes.
5633957 5636710 But keep your secret<br />for a little while longer.
5636835 5639922 Wouldn't do to upset your mother<br />with a false hope, would it?
5640047 5643091 But it isn't false.<br />I know you can do it.
5643175 5645886 I knew you could when I wrote.<br />It isn't false hope, is it?
5646011 5647596 No, my dear.
5647721 5651141 You don't believe Daddy did it?<br />Oh, say you don't believe he did.
5651266 5654853 My dear, I'm perfectly certain<br />he didn't.
5670202 5672621 <i>Life at Three Chimneys<br />was never quite the same again</i>
5672746 5674248 <i>after the old gentleman<br />came to see us.</i>
5676458 5678168 Oh, please Phyllis.
5678252 5680754 <i>The house became a hospital.</i>
5682714 5684883 I give you three guesses<br />who that is.
5687928 5691098 Is everything all right?<br />Good luck. I'll curtain up.
5692891 5693892 Have you...
5694017 5697938 Have you noticed<br />the ship is sinking?
5698063 5701316 Yes I know,<br />but don't blame me.
5703026 5706446 Oh, no!<br />Oh, no they'll all get so wet.
5707489 5710033 You'll need some light<br />on the subject.
5711702 5715289 As your solicitor<br />I must advise you.
5716790 5718917 Don't worry.
5719042 5722045 Don't worry,<br />I've managed to get most of the survivors.
5722171 5723672 Right, curtain down.
5723797 5726884 Thank you, good evening.
5734016 5736018 I hope you enjoyed it.
5745903 5748447 Children, will you please be quiet.
5748572 5750115 Oh, the blood!
5752034 5754119 - Oh, is it over?<br />- Oh, thank goodness.
5754244 5756455 - Oh, you are a good doctor.<br />- Can I have that please?
5756580 5758040 There we are. How's that?
5758790 5760334 - Cheerio.<br />- Bye.
5760459 5763670 <i>Jim's leg got better<br />and he went home.</i>
5763796 5766298 - Right away, Mr Mitchell.<br />- Thank you, Mr Perks.
5772262 5774264 Goodbye.<br />Goodbye.
5774348 5778435 - Goodbye.<br />- Bye, I'll write.
5780437 5784983 - Lor lummy, Pete!<br />- They'll have to marry now!
5785108 5786068 Lummy.
5790155 5793158 <i>We seemed to be hardly<br />Railway Children at all in those days</i>
5793283 5798080 <i>and as the days went on each of us<br />had an uneasy feeling about this</i>
5798205 5800207 <i>which Phyllis expressed one day.</i>
5800290 5804169 I wonder if the railway misses us.<br />We never go and see it now.
5804294 5805462 It seems ungrateful.
5805587 5808590 We loved it so when we hadn't<br />anyone to play with.
5808715 5811468 The thing I don't like is our having<br />stopped waving to the 9:15
5811593 5813554 and sending our love to Father by it.
5813679 5815973 Let's begin again tomorrow.
5829403 5831363 Hurry up, Fatty,<br />for goodness sake.
5831488 5833740 I can't, my bootlace is undone.
5833866 5837161 When you marry your laces<br />will come undone going up the aisle
5837286 5840289 and the man that you marry<br />will tumble over and smash his nose in.
5840372 5844918 I'd rather marry a man with<br />a smashed in nose than not marry at all.
5851216 5854511 - Take our love to Father!<br />- Take our love to Father!
5891048 5892549 Most extraordinary!
5892674 5896428 - Most extraordinary.<br />- Extraordinary indeed.
5897846 5901975 Now, Bobbie,<br />I wonder whether you could...
5903769 5905854 Don't you feel well?
5905979 5909942 I don't know.<br />I don't know how I feel...
5910067 5911819 Will you let me off lessons today?
5911944 5915906 I feel as if I want to be<br />quite alone, by myself.
5916031 5918075 Of course I'll let you off.
5924498 5928001 What is it?<br />You don't feel ill, do you?
5928127 5931004 No, not ill.
5931130 5934716 I've just got to be alone,<br />do you know?
5934842 5939304 Mm, sometimes Roberta,<br />you're so like me.
5945435 5947437 I'll be more alive in the garden.
5959074 5961451 - Morning, Miss, I'm sure.<br />- Good luck, Miss Roberta.
5961577 5963078 Thank you.
5964955 5968125 Hello. Look, if this is the train,<br />it'll be smart work.
5968250 5972504 Bless you. I seen it in the paper. I was<br />never so pleased in all my born days.
5972629 5975299 One I most have and no offence I know<br />on a day like this.
5976133 5978844 And one for luck.<br />You ain't offended, are you?
5978969 5982097 I haven't taken too great a liberty, have I,<br />on a day like this, you know.
5982222 5984975 - No, Mr Perks, of course it's not a liberty.<br />- No.
5985100 5988604 Dear Mr Perks, we love you quite as much<br />as if you were an uncle of our own
5988729 5990022 but on a day like what?
5990147 5993400 Well like this�ere. I told you,<br />I seen it in the papers, didn't I?
5993484 5995194 Saw what in the papers?
5995319 6005037 Oakworth!
6006497 6009208 Oakworth Station.
6009333 6012002 Oakworth. There we are.<br />Thank you, Madam.
6012127 6014588 Yes, thank you.<br />Quick as you can, please.
6015964 6018884 Oakworth Station.
6022179 6025432 - Right away, Mr Cryer.<br />- Thank you, Mr Perks.
6060926 6063762 Daddy, my Daddy!
6157898 6161777 <i>I think just now<br />we're not wanted there.</i>
6161902 6165072 <i>Not for a few minutes anyway.</i>
6165197 6169868 <i>I think it would best for us<br />to go quickly and quietly.</i>
6169993 6176166 <i>We'll go to the end of the field<br />among the thin gold spikes of grass.</i>
6176291 6181088 <i>We may just take one last look<br />over our shoulders, at the house</i>
6181213 6184466 <i>where neither we nor anyone else<br />is wanted now.</i>
6256747 6260125 - Bye.<br />- Bye, bye.
6260250 6262211 Hope you loved it.
6274056 6275766 Goodbye.
