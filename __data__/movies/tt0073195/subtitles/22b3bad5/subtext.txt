728312 731607 Martin, you're going to shut down<br />the beaches on your own authority?
731690 733401 What other authority<br />do I need?
733484 734902 Technically, you need<br />a civic ordinance
734985 736487 or a resolution<br />by a board of...
736612 737988 That's just going<br />by the book.
738114 739407 We're really<br />a little anxious
739490 742243 that you're rushing into<br />something serious here.
742326 744370 This is your first<br />summer, you know.
744453 746163 What does that mean?
746622 750209 I'm only trying to say that<br />Amity is a summer town.
750876 752837 We need summer dollars.
753045 754463 If they can't<br />swim here
754547 756382 they'll be glad to<br />swim at the beaches
756465 758717 of Cape Cod, the<br />Hamptons, Long Island.
758843 761137 That doesn't mean we serve<br />them a smorgasbord.
761220 764640 But we've never had that kind<br />of trouble in these waters.
764723 766559 What else could've<br />done that to that girl?
766642 767726 A boat propeller?
767852 771063 I think possibly,<br />yes, a boating accident.
771188 772731 That's not what you<br />told me on the phone.
772815 774275 I was wrong.
774358 776277 We'll have to<br />amend our reports.
776360 777361 And you'll<br />stand by that?
777445 779071 I'll stand by that.
779405 783868 Martin, a summer girl goes<br />swimming, swims out a little far.
784368 786495 She tires, fishing<br />boat comes along...
786579 787705 It's happened before.
787830 790249 I don't think you<br />appreciate the gut reaction
790332 791500 people have<br />to these things.
791584 794545 Larry, I appreciate it.<br />I'm just reacting to what I was told.
794670 797173 Martin,<br />it's all psychological.
797756 801552 You yell, "Barracuda!" and<br />everybody says, "Huh? What?"
803512 805389 You yell, "Shark!"...
806557 809685 we've got a panic on our<br />hands on the Fourth of July.

1440982 1442734 He's not on the ocean,<br />he is in a boat.
1442818 1444194 He won't go<br />in the water.
1444319 1448698 I don't think he'll go in the water<br />again, after what happened yesterday.

1452744 1455747 I don't want that to<br />happen, you know that.
1457207 1459126 I want him to read<br />the boating regulations,

1812812 1813938 What can we do<br />for you?
1814022 1816816 The best thing to do<br />is to see the remains

1904487 1906072 Thank you very much.
1908658 1911828 Partially denuded bone remaining.<br />This was no boat accident.
1911911 1913955 Did you notify<br />the Coast Guard about this?
1914038 1916833 No. It was only<br />local jurisdiction.
1920044 1923631 The left arm, head,<br />the shoulders, sternum
1923715 1925133 and portions of<br />the rib cage are intact.

1935602 1939522 <i>possibly longimanus<br />or lsurus glaucus.</i>
1940940 1944277 The enormous amount of tissue loss<br />prevents any detailed analysis
1944360 1947864 however, the attacking squalus<br />must be considerably larger
1948072 1950450 than any normal squalus<br />found in these waters.
1950533 1952827 Didn't you get out a boat<br />and check these waters?

2056681 2058141 I think it's a mako.
2058224 2059475 It's got a deep throat,<br />Frank.
2059559 2061602 Yeah, but what kind?<br />What kind of shark?

2071821 2073197 That is a big mouth.
2073990 2075241 You stuff your frigging<br />head in there, man,
2075324 2078327 and find out if<br />it's a man-eater.
2082498 2084834 All I'm saying is that<br />it may not be the shark.

2091674 2092633 Nice to meet you.
2092717 2094343 Terrific, huh, Mayor?
2095887 2098723 There are all kinds of<br />sharks in the waters.
2098806 2101017 Hammerheads, white<br />tips, blues, makos.
2101434 2104103 And the chances that these<br />bozos got the exact shark...
2104187 2106105 There are no other<br />sharks like this here.
2106189 2108107 It's 100-to-1.
2108691 2112820 I'm not saying that this is not the shark.<br />It probably is, Martin.
2112904 2115740 It's a man-eater.<br />It's extremely rare for these waters.
2115865 2118367 But the fact is, the bite<br />radius on this animal
2118451 2120912 is different than the<br />wounds on the victim.
2122371 2125082 I want to be sure.<br />You want to be sure.
2125166 2126709 We all want to<br />be sure, okay?
2126793 2128419 What I want to do<br />is very simple.
2128544 2131297 The digestive system of<br />this animal is very slow.
2131380 2132507 Let's cut it open.
2132590 2134509 Whatever it's eaten<br />in the last 24 hours
2134592 2136052 is bound to<br />still be in there.
2136135 2138095 And then we'll be sure.
2143893 2146145 It may be the only way<br />to confirm it.
2146229 2148564 Look, fellows,<br />let's be reasonable.
2149065 2151275 This is not<br />the time or the place
2151400 2154946 to perform some kind of a<br />half-assed autopsy on a fish.

2266599 2267850 VAUGHN:<br />All right, fellows
2267934 2269894 let's cut this ugly<br />son of a bitch down
2269977 2271896 before it stinks up<br />the whole island.

2352476 2353936 Give us a kiss.
2354020 2355146 VVhy?
2357732 2359483 Because I need it.
2360151 2361777 (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
2363779 2365448 Get out of here.
2366574 2367700 ELLEN: Can I help you?

2369452 2370995 I'm Matt Hooper.
2371078 2372538 Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.
2372621 2374123 Your husband's home?<br />Yes.
2374206 2375833 I'd really like<br />to talk to him.
2375916 2377501 Yes, so would I.
2378461 2380713 Come in.<br />Can I get you some coffee?
2380796 2382006 No. Nothing, thank you.
2382089 2383758 Oh, wine. How nice.
2402693 2404361 How was your day?
2405696 2407323 (BOTH LAUGHING)
2410242 2411452 Swell.
2414663 2417500 I got red and white.<br />I didn't know what you'd be serving.
2417583 2419043 Oh, that's nice.
2420336 2422296 Is anyone eating this?
2422379 2423589 No.
2431806 2434517 My husband tells me<br />you're in sharks.
2435434 2436560 (LAUGHS)
2437144 2440147 Excuse me. Yes.<br />I've never heard it quite put that way.
2440231 2441732 But yes, I am.
2442191 2443484 I love sharks.
2443567 2444610 You love sharks?
2444693 2446028 Yeah, I love them.
2446112 2448364 When I was 12 years old,<br />my father got me a boat
2448447 2450199 and I went fishing<br />off of Cape Cod.
2450282 2452451 I hooked a soup and<br />as I was reeling it in
2452535 2455371 I hooked a 4.5 foot<br />baby thresher shark
2455454 2457081 who proceeded<br />to eat my boat.
2458582 2462211 He ate my oar, hooks,<br />and my seat cushions.
2462294 2463671 He turned an inboard<br />into an outboard
2463754 2467091 scared me to death,<br />and I swam back to shore.
2467174 2469635 When I was on the beach,<br />I turned around
2469718 2471679 and actually saw my<br />boat being taken apart.
2471762 2474348 Ever since then, I have<br />been studying sharks
2474431 2478185 and that's why I know that I'm going<br />to go to the Institute tomorrow
2478269 2480855 and tell them that you still<br />have a shark problem here.
2480980 2482898 Why do you have to tell them that?<br />Sorry.
2482982 2484608 I'm sorry,<br />I thought that...
2484692 2485985 You told me<br />the shark was caught.
2486068 2488654 I heard it on the news.<br />I heard it on the Cape station.
2488737 2491323 They caught a shark,<br />not the shark.
2491824 2494410 Not the shark that<br />killed Chrissie Watkins.
2494618 2497288 And probably not the shark<br />that killed the little boy.
2497371 2500166 Which I wanted to prove today<br />by cutting the shark open...
2500249 2503335 You may want to let<br />that breathe... Nothing.
2519935 2523272 You know, you'll be<br />the only rational man
2523355 2525065 left on this island<br />after I leave tomorrow.
2525774 2527318 Where are you going?
2528611 2530362 <i>I am going<br />on the Aurora.</i>
2530446 2531864 The Aurora?<br />What is that?
2531947 2534867 It's a floating asylum<br />for shark addicts.
2534950 2536994 It's pure research,<br />18 months at sea.
2537411 2540956 Martin hates boats.<br />Martin hates water.
2541582 2545669 Martin sits in his car when we<br />go on the ferry to the mainland.
2545961 2547963 I guess it's<br />a childhood thing.
2548047 2549715 There's a clinical name<br />for it, isn't there?
2549798 2551258 Drowning.
2552009 2553969 Is it true that most<br />people get attacked
2554053 2556305 by sharks in<br />three feet of water
2556388 2558015 about 10 feet<br />from the beach?
2558098 2559183 Yeah.
2559767 2563312 And that before people started<br />to swim for recreation...
2563395 2566565 I mean, before sharks<br />knew what they were missing
2566649 2569944 that a lot of these<br />attacks weren't reported?
2570027 2571278 That's right.
2573364 2576158 Now this shark<br />that swims alone
2576283 2577451 what's it called?<br />Rogue.
2577534 2578953 Rogue, yeah.
2579411 2582498 This guy,<br />he keeps swimming around
2582581 2584375 in a place where<br />the feeding is good
2584458 2586335 until the food<br />supply is gone, right?
2586418 2587920 That's called<br />territoriality.
2588003 2591257 It's just a theory that<br />I happen to agree with.
2593842 2595427 Then why don't we<br />have one more drink
2595511 2598013 and go down<br />and cut that shark open?
2598514 2601225 Martin?<br />Can you do that?
2605062 2608065 I can do anything.<br />I'm the Chief of Police.

2651066 2652151 Just like I thought.
2652234 2653235 What?
2654236 2657573 Came up in the Gulf Stream,<br />from southern waters.
2662870 2664163 He didn't eat a car,<br />did he?
2664246 2665372 No.
2665706 2668459 Tiger shark's like a garbage can.<br />It'll eat anything.
2668542 2671503 Somebody probably<br />threw that in the river.
2671795 2673547 (PANTING)
2677801 2679178 That's it.
2681013 2684099 I've got to close the<br />beach, call the Mayor.
2684933 2687311 You got a bigger problem<br />than that, Martin.
2687394 2689938 You still got a hell<br />of a fish out there
2690022 2691815 with a mouth<br />about this big.
2696320 2698489 How do we confirm that<br />by morning?
2699323 2703327 If he is a rogue, and there's any<br />truth to territoriality at all
2703410 2705204 we got a good chance<br />of spotting him
2705287 2706997 between Cape Scott<br />and South Beach.
2707081 2708207 Where are you going?
2708290 2709708 To find him.<br />He's a night feeder.
2709833 2710834 On the water?
2710918 2712419 We're not gonna<br />find him on the land.
2712503 2713879 I'm not drunk enough<br />to go on a boat.
2713962 2715005 Yes, you are.
2715089 2716382 No, I'm not.<br />Yes, you are.
2716465 2717925 I can't do that.<br />Yes, you can.
2722679 2724181 (BOAT ENGINE WHIRRING)
2727101 2730729 I'm telling you, the crime rate<br />in New York will kill you.

2741365 2744368 But in Amity, one man<br />can make a difference.
2744868 2747079 In 25 years,<br />there's never been
2747162 2748831 a shooting or a murder<br />in this town.
2749706 2752209 No kidding?<br />Want a pretzel?
2752960 2754169 Where are we?
2754253 2757256 We're right in the stretch<br />where he's been feeding.
2759716 2761593 Can you get The <i>Late<br />Show</i> on this thing?
2761677 2763262 No, it's a closed<br />circuit TV system.
2763345 2765889 I have underwater<br />cameras fore-and-aft.
2766515 2768225 Who pays<br />for all this stuff?
2768308 2769726 The government?<br />The Institute?
2769810 2771854 This stuff costs<br />a lot of money.
2773397 2775774 I paid for this<br />mostly myself, actually.
2775858 2777651 You're kidding.<br />No.
2778318 2779987 You rich?<br />Yeah.
2780779 2782156 How much?
2782239 2783740 Personally,<br />or the whole family?
2785200 2789329 Doesn't make any sense.<br />They pay a guy like you to watch sharks?
2789746 2793208 Well, it doesn't<br />make sense for a guy
2793292 2794835 who hates the water to<br />live on an island either.
2795627 2798714 It's only an island if you<br />look at it from the water.
2798964 2800757 That makes<br />a lot of sense.

2809850 2811894 Well, it's a fish finder.

3022646 3024731 This is a great white,<br />Larry. A big one.
3024815 3027693 Any shark expert will tell you<br />it's a killer, a man-eater.
3027776 3030529 The situation is that<br />apparently a great white shark
3030612 3032906 has staked a claim in the<br />waters off Amity Island.
3032989 3036201 He'll continue to feed here as<br />long as there's food in the water.
3036284 3037869 There's no limit<br />to what he'll do.
3037953 3039329 We've had<br />three incidents.
3039413 3041832 Two people killed within a week.<br />It'll happen again.
3041915 3044000 It happened before.<br />The Jersey beach, 1916.
3044126 3046044 Five people were killed...<br />In one week.
3046128 3047379 Tell him<br />about the swimmers.
3047462 3050716 A shark is attracted to the exact<br />kind of splashing and activity
3050799 3053635 that occurs whenever human beings swim.<br />You can't avoid it.
3053719 3057389 Opening the beaches on the Fourth of<br />July is like ringing the dinner bell.
3057472 3058849 Look, Mr. Vaughn
3058932 3061643 I pulled a tooth<br />the size of a shot glass
3061727 3063270 out of the wrecked hull<br />of a boat out there.
3063353 3064855 It was the tooth<br />of a great white.
3064938 3066606 It was Gardner's boat,<br />all chewed up.
3066690 3068984 I helped tow it in.<br />You should've seen it!
3069067 3071820 Where is that tooth?<br />Did you see it, Brody?
3072195 3073822 I didn't see it.<br />He dropped it on the way in.
3073905 3075949 I had an accident.
3076116 3079286 And what did you say the<br />name of this shark is?
3080620 3083540 It's a Carcharodon carcharias.<br />It's a great white.
3083749 3085709 You don't<br />have the tooth?
3086960 3089796 Look, we depend on the summer<br />people for our very lives...
3089880 3092966 You won't have a summer unless<br />you deal with this problem!
3093049 3096219 We have to close the beach and<br />hire someone to kill the shark!
3096303 3098096 We have to tell<br />the Coast Guard.
3098180 3101141 You'll have to contact<br />the Shark Research Panel.
3101224 3103518 You'll have to ring<br />this entire harbor!
3103602 3105312 I don't think<br />either one of you
3105395 3107105 are familiar<br />with our problems!
3107189 3109399 I think that I am<br />familiar with the fact
3109483 3111651 that you'll ignore<br />this particular problem
3111735 3114070 until it swims up and<br />bites you in the ass!
3114154 3117157 Wait a second! There are two<br />ways to deal with this problem!
3117240 3120368 You either kill this animal<br />or cut off its food supply.

3133632 3135342 and hung up by<br />their Buster Browns.

3138553 3139763 who's lining up<br />to be a hot lunch.
3139846 3141139 I'm gonna see<br />you later, Brody.
3141223 3143308 Don't do this.<br />He's not...
3149940 3154778 What we are dealing with here is a<br />perfect engine, an eating machine.
3155362 3157072 It's really<br />a miracle of evolution.
3157155 3160992 All this machine does<br />is swim and eat
3161243 3163745 and make little sharks.<br />And that's all.
3163954 3166748 Why don't you take a long,<br />close look at this sign?
3166832 3169000 Those proportions<br />are correct.

4614361 4616405 What's he yanking on now?
4617281 4618865 Go on, try it.
4631461 4634548 I don't know, Chief, if he's<br />very smart or very dumb.
4641555 4642723 Jesus“.
4646435 4647894 He's gone under.
4648103 4651898 He's gone under the boat.<br />I think he's gone under the boat.
4652691 4654234 Yeah, it's too easy.
4654359 4657612 He is a smart, big fish.<br />He's gone under the boat.
4658113 4661366 Keep her steady, now.<br />I got something very big!
4661575 4662993 I don't think so.
4664161 4666121 Chief, put your gloves on.
4666705 4669291 You put your gloves on,<br />both of you!
4671960 4674004 Getting ready<br />to run out again.
4674755 4676381 Quint, let it go.
4676465 4679176 Maybe you're a big yahoo<br />in the lab,
4679259 4680552 but out here<br />you're just supercargo!
4680635 4683388 If you don't want to backstroke<br />home, you get down here!
4683472 4686391 You don't want to listen<br />to me, don't listen to me.
4686475 4687684 It's not a shark.
4687768 4689811 The wire's showing.
4689895 4691355 Unbuckle me.
4692272 4693857 Get the other side.
4693940 4695484 It's a tuna<br />or swordfish
4696234 4697903 wasting our time.
4698612 4700113 Take this rod.
4700197 4701865 Hooper, give the Chief<br />a hand, will you?
4701948 4702991 Right!
4703075 4704117 Oh, shit!
4714294 4717005 It may be a marlin<br />or a stingray
4717631 4719841 but it's definitely<br />a game fish.
4731603 4732979 Gaming fish?
4733688 4737067 Marlin, stingray bit<br />through this piano wire?
4737150 4738860 Don't you tell me<br />my business again.
4739152 4740153 You get back<br />on the bridge.
4740237 4742781 Quint, that doesn't<br />prove a damn thing.
4742864 4744991 It proves one thing,<br />Mr. Hooper.
4745075 4748245 You wealthy college boys don't<br />have the education enough
4748328 4750080 to admit<br />if you're wrong.

4783738 4787200 I'm not going to haul them<br />up like a lot of catfish.

5375997 5379876 I was coming back from the<br />island of Tinian to Leyte
5379959 5383087 just delivered the bomb,<br />the Hiroshima bomb.
5386257 5389010 1,100 men went<br />into the water.
5389093 5390928 Vessel went down<br />in 12 minutes.

5398478 5401355 You know how you know that when<br />you're in the water, Chief?
5401439 5404692 You tell by looking from<br />the dorsal to the tail.
5406277 5408154 Well, we didn't know.
5408529 5411657 Because our bomb mission<br />had been so secret
5412450 5414827 no distress signal<br />had been sent.
5415912 5417163 (CHUCKLES)
5421501 5424545 They didn't even list us<br />overdue for a week.
5426005 5429509 Very first light,<br />sharks come cruising
5430009 5432929 so we formed ourselves<br />into tight groups.
5433805 5436641 You know, kind of<br />like old squares
5436724 5438309 in a battle like<br />you see on a calendar
5438392 5441187 like the Battle of Waterloo.<br />The idea was...
5441270 5442897 the shark comes<br />to the nearest man
5442980 5445775 and he starts pounding,<br />hollering and screaming.
5445858 5448486 Sometimes the shark<br />would go away...
5449445 5451447 but sometimes<br />he wouldn't go away.
5451531 5455785 Sometimes that shark, he looks right<br />into you, right into your eyes.
5455952 5457161 (SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
5457245 5459872 You know, a thing<br />about a shark, he's got...
5460331 5464335 lifeless eyes.<br />Black eyes, like a doll's eyes.
5465962 5469465 When he comes at you, he<br />doesn't seem to be living
5469799 5474720 until he bites you.<br />Those black eyes roll over white and then...
5476222 5479725 Then you hear that terrible<br />high-pitched screaming.
5480143 5482061 The ocean turns red.
5482478 5486315 In spite of the pounding and the<br />hollering, they all come in.
5488025 5489735 They rip you<br />to pieces.
5489986 5492196 (GRAVE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
5494574 5497577 You know, by the end<br />of that first dawn...
5498744 5500371 we lost 100 men.
5501873 5504417 I don't know how many sharks.<br />Maybe 1,000.
5504542 5507587 I don't know how many men,<br />they averaged six an hour.
5508212 5511174 On Thursday morning, I bumped<br />into a friend of mine...
5511257 5513676 Herbie Robinson,<br />from Cleveland.
5514886 5517513 Baseball player,<br />bosun's mate.
5519599 5523644 I thought he was asleep.<br />Reached over to wake him up.
5525271 5529108 He bobbed up and down in the<br />water just like a kind of top.
5529775 5531068 Upended.
5535114 5537783 He'd been bitten in half,<br />below the waist.
5541621 5545708 Noon the fifth day,<br />a Lockheed Ventura saw us.
5545791 5548920 He swung in low and he saw us.<br />He was a young pilot.
5549003 5550213 Younger than Mr. Hooper.
5550296 5553132 He saw us and he came in low,<br />and three hours later...
5553257 5556719 a big fat PBY comes down<br />and starts to pick us up.
5556802 5559639 That was the time<br />I was most frightened.
5560306 5562141 Waiting for my turn.
5563517 5566270 I'll never put on<br />a life jacket again.
5567980 5570441 So, 1,100 men went<br />into the water
5571150 5573069 316 men come out.
5573152 5577114 The sharks took the rest,<br />June 29, 1945.

5849678 5852139 (SOMBER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
5860981 5864693 When he runs, you drop that<br />rope or you'll lose your hands.
5866028 5868197 I've seen fingers<br />torn out at the knuckles.
5868280 5870282 Whole sea's bones,<br />full of them.
5870366 5872284 Give it to me a minute.

5890970 5892429 Start the engine.
5894765 5896350 Where are you going?
5896433 5897977 I'm going to<br />make a phone call.
5904400 5906902 Hello, mayday, Orca.<br />Coast Guard?
5908237 5910739 Coast Guard, this is the Orca.<br />Do you read me?
5910823 5913325 Coast Guard, this is the Orca.<br />Do you...
5919415 5920958 Excuse me, Chief.
5921333 5924753 That's great!<br />That's just great!
5924837 5926505 Now, where the hell<br />are we, eh?
5927923 5931677 You're certifiable, Quint, you know that?<br />You're certifiable!
5932011 5933804 You're certifiable,<br />but I'll tell you this!
5933887 5935180 Boys,
5936849 5939518 I think he's come back<br />for his noon feeding.
5941020 5942813 Hook me up<br />another barrel.
5943355 5945357 (TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
5973427 5975262 Bring her around<br />after him.
5978682 5981018 (LIGHT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
5992112 5994573 Full throttle!<br />Get me right up alongside of him!
5994698 5997951 I can't rev it up that high,<br />it's not going to take it!
5998243 6001080 (ADVENTUROUS INSTRUMENTAL<br />MUSIC PLAYING)
6015678 6017262 Five degrees port.
6024144 6026105 All right,<br />hold your course.
6032444 6034363 Five degrees port now.
6037866 6039284 Hold your course.

6042287 6043455 QUINT: Watch my hand.
6044665 6048210 Be sure you watch<br />my hand! Follow me.
6049461 6052047 Lad, you watch him now!<br />Starboard!
6053298 6055134 Run him down, Hooper.
6062307 6063642 Hard aport.
6067479 6069148 Watch him. Starboard.
6079324 6081368 (TENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC<br />PLAYING)
6093964 6097301 I can't believe it.<br />Two barrels and he's going down again.
6102931 6104349 It's incredible.
6110397 6112316 They're up again!<br />Now what?
6121575 6123952 Why don't we lead<br />the shark into shore
6124036 6125829 instead of him<br />leading us out to sea?
6130292 6132002 Grab a couple of poles.
6134296 6136423 Hang on now,<br />we're going around.
6137216 6139718 Into starboard. Easy.
6140677 6142721 I'm going to<br />back her off now.
6142805 6144598 Watch those barrels, boys.<br />Watch them.
6149144 6151230 All right, gentlemen,<br />snag them.
6156485 6158862 Now then, tie them<br />to the stern cleats.
6162115 6164743 Brody, bring your end<br />around the cleat.
6165786 6169331 That's right, it'll lock itself off.<br />Give him room, Brody.
6170290 6171333 (GROANING)
6171416 6173126 Stay clear of the line!
6180884 6182594 Watch it. Stand clear.
6192729 6195232 Stand away from<br />those stern cleats!
6208370 6210455 Back home we got<br />a taxidermy man.
6210539 6211999 He's going to<br />have a heart attack
6212082 6214751 when he sees what I brought him.<br />(LAUGHS)
6220632 6223468 Throttle back.<br />You're losing a cleat.
6226179 6228849 My God, this one, too.<br />They're both going.
6229099 6231018 He's eating his way<br />through that line.
6231101 6232978 He's working his way<br />right up to us.
6233103 6235939 Quint!<br />Come on, Quint. Hurry!
6238483 6239776 Out of my way.
6244990 6245991 Watch it.
6250037 6252664 Untie this.<br />He'll pull out the transom.
6256501 6258462 Make it fast! We got<br />another line in him!
6258545 6260505 I can't,<br />it's trying to run!
6261882 6263592 BRODY: We better<br />get another line!
6263675 6265677 QUINT: Pull,<br />you son of a bitch!
6265969 6268180 I hope your back breaks!
6268263 6270140 Go ahead. Pull your<br />bloody heart out.
6270807 6272184 Tie him off!
6277356 6279691 It's impossible!
6280901 6282569 Boys, it's too tight!
6283028 6284821 HOOPER: He's pulling us!
6286740 6288659 We're breaking up<br />over here!

6311264 6313058 (HOOPER PANTING)
6324403 6326780 He can't stay down with<br />three barrels on him.
6326905 6329074 Not with three barrels,<br />he can't.
6329241 6330742 What about us?
6331284 6334955 Hooper, get the pump out of the<br />locker in front of you, will you?
6335414 6337165 We're going to sink,<br />aren't we?
6337249 6340210 Keep an eye on the barrels.<br />Pump it out, Chief.

6626538 6629916 What exactly can you do<br />with these things of yours?
6633753 6637841 I think I can pump 20 cc of<br />strychnine nitrate into him.
6638216 6640427 If I can get<br />close enough.
6642887 6645390 Get this little needle<br />through his skin?
6647183 6648768 No, I can't do that.
6650729 6652647 If I can get him<br />close to the cage,
6652731 6653898 I can get him<br />in the mouth.
6653982 6655525 That shark will rip<br />that cage to pieces.
