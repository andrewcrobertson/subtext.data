728312 731606 Martin, you're going to shut down<br />the beaches on your own authority?
731690 733399 What other authority do I need?
733483 734961 Technically, you<br />need a civic ordinance
734985 736485 or a resolution by a board of...
736612 737987 That's just going by the book.
738113 739405 We're really a little anxious
739489 742241 that you're rushing into<br />something serious here.
742326 744368 This is your first<br />summer, you know.
744453 746162 What does that mean?
746622 750207 I'm only trying to say that<br />Amity is a summer town.
750876 752835 We need summer dollars.
753045 754462 If they can't swim here
754546 756380 they'll be glad to<br />swim at the beaches
756465 758716 of Cape Cod, the<br />Hamptons, Long Island.
758842 761135 That doesn't mean we<br />serve them a smorgasbord.
761219 764639 But we've never had that<br />kind of trouble in these waters.
764723 766557 What else could've<br />done that to that girl?
766642 767725 A boat propeller?
767851 771062 I think possibly, yes,<br />a boating accident.
771188 772788 That's not what you<br />told me on the phone.
772814 774273 I was wrong.
774358 776275 We'll have to amend our reports.
776360 777360 And you'll stand by that?

790332 791499 people have to these things.
791583 794543 Larry, I appreciate it. I'm<br />just reacting to what I was told.

1297547 1299548 Gonna stay alive and ante up,
1299632 1303218 gonna play it cheap and be<br />on welfare the whole winter.
1304721 1307055 I don't want no volunteers.<br />I don't want no mates.
1307182 1310058 There's too many<br />captains on this island.
1310560 1312895 $10,000 for me, by myself.
1313730 1318400 For that, you get the head,<br />the tail, the whole damn thing.
1322363 1324740 Thank you very much, Mr. Quint.

1375333 1376625 Oh. Oh.
1378294 1382047 You know, Ellen, people don't<br />even know how old sharks are.
1382131 1385300 I mean, if they live 2,000,<br />3,000 years... They don't know.
1385426 1387594 Enough.
1387679 1389573 You're not going to even<br />be able to go to sleep tonight.

1410952 1413287 Mikey really loves his present.
1414622 1416123 Where is he?
1416207 1417332 Sitting in it.
1420503 1421837 Good God.
1425675 1427968 All right, Michael,<br />out of the boat!
1428970 1432180 Tied up to the jetties,<br />sitting in the boat.
1432265 1433724 I'm helping Michael.
1434142 1435434 Get out of that boat!
1435518 1438186 Hi, Dad. Just a<br />little longer. Please?
1438313 1439771 It's his birthday.
1439856 1440958 I don't want him on the ocean!
1440982 1442733 He's not on the<br />ocean, he is in a boat.
1442817 1444192 He won't go in the water.
1444319 1448697 I don't think he'll go in the water<br />again, after what happened yesterday.
1450074 1452409 All right, now don't say that.
1452744 1455746 I don't want that to<br />happen, you know that.
1457206 1459124 I want him to read<br />the boating regulations,
1459208 1462377 the rules, before he<br />goes out on his own.
1462545 1466840 Michael, did you hear your<br />father? Out of the water now!

1710668 1713545 You have to move out<br />or he can't get out at all.
1713963 1716923 Don't raise sail, you're going<br />to luff it. You got a paddle?
1717008 1718758 I got a paddle.<br />Scull it out of here.

1727476 1728727 Yeah, well that ain't safe.

1732481 1733542 Where are you going with that?
1733566 1735317 I'm going on the boat.

1808849 1810850 Oh. I'm glad to<br />meet you. Me, too.
1810935 1812727 I know you got a<br />lot on your hands.
1812812 1813937 What can we do for you?
1814021 1816815 The best thing to do<br />is to see the remains
1816899 1818502 of the first victim,<br />the girl on the beach.
1818526 1820151 Okay, fine. Just bear<br />with me, will you?
1820236 1821361 Sure.
1822863 1825865 Wait till we get them silly<br />bastards down in that rock pile.

1871704 1872889 And here's the way we have it.
1872913 1875498 "Probable boating accident."
1881338 1883048 The height and<br />weight of the victim
1883132 1886176 can only be estimated<br />from the partial remains.
1887261 1889304 (HOOPER BREATHING HEAVILY)
1891182 1893641 The torso has been<br />severed in mid-thorax.
1893726 1895226 There are no major<br />organs remaining.
1895311 1896895 May I have a glass of water?
1896979 1898188 The right arm has been severed
1898272 1901691 above the elbow with<br />massive tissue loss
1902026 1903818 in the upper musculature.
1904487 1906071 Thank you very much.
1908657 1911826 Partially denuded bone remaining.<br />This was no boat accident.
1911911 1913953 Did you notify the<br />Coast Guard about this?
1914038 1916831 No. It was only<br />local jurisdiction.
1920044 1923630 The left arm, head,<br />the shoulders, sternum
1923714 1925192 and portions of the<br />rib cage are intact.
1925216 1927842 Do not smoke in here.<br />Thank you very much.
1929345 1931262 This is what happens.
1932348 1935517 Indicates the non-frenzy<br />feeding of a large squalus
1935601 1939521 possibly longimanus<br /><i>or Isurus glaucus.</i>
1940940 1944275 The enormous amount of tissue<br />loss prevents any detailed analysis
1944360 1947862 however, the attacking squalus<br />must be considerably larger
1948072 1950448 than any normal squalus<br />found in these waters.
1950533 1952826 Didn't you get out a boat<br />and check these waters?
1952910 1953952 No.
1954036 1955703 Well, this is not<br />a boat accident.
1956038 1959582 And it wasn't any propeller.<br />It wasn't any coral reef.
1959959 1961960 And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.
1964922 1966381 It was a shark.

2051967 2053718 Larry, you won't believe it.
2053802 2055220 What kind of a shark is that?
2055304 2056471 I don't know.
2056680 2058139 I think it's a mako.
2058224 2059474 It's got a deep throat, Frank.
2059558 2061601 Yeah, but what kind?<br />What kind of shark?
2061685 2062810 Tiger shark.
2064730 2065855 A what?
2065981 2067440 We can start breathing again.
2067524 2068793 Is Ben getting<br />plenty of pictures?
2068817 2070026 Oh, you bet he is.
2070152 2071736 What is this bite radius crap?
2071820 2073196 That is a big mouth.
2073989 2075300 You stuff your frigging<br />head in there, man,
2075324 2078326 and find out if<br />it's a man-eater.
2082498 2084832 All I'm saying is that it<br />may not be the shark.
2084917 2086084 It's just a slight...
2086168 2089629 I want you to meet Matt. This<br />is Larry Vaughn, our mayor.
2089713 2091589 Matt's from the<br />Oceanographic Institute.
2091674 2092674 Nice to meet you.
2092716 2094342 Terrific, huh, Mayor?
2095886 2098721 There are all kinds of<br />sharks in the waters.
2098806 2101015 Hammerheads, white<br />tips, blues, makos.
2101433 2104102 And the chances that these<br />bozos got the exact shark...
2104186 2106104 There are no other<br />sharks like this here.
2106188 2108106 It's 100-to-1.
2108691 2112819 I'm not saying that this is not<br />the shark. It probably is, Martin.
2112903 2115738 It's a man-eater. It's<br />extremely rare for these waters.
2115864 2118366 But the fact is, the bite<br />radius on this animal
2118450 2120910 is different than the<br />wounds on the victim.
2122371 2125081 I want to be sure.<br />You want to be sure.
2125165 2126708 We all want to be sure, okay?
2126792 2128418 What I want to<br />do is very simple.
2128544 2131296 The digestive system of<br />this animal is very slow.
2131380 2132505 Let's cut it open.
2132589 2134507 Whatever it's eaten<br />in the last 24 hours
2134591 2136050 is bound to still be in there.
2136135 2138094 And then we'll be sure.
2143892 2146144 It may be the only<br />way to confirm it.
2146228 2148563 Look, fellows,<br />let's be reasonable.
2149064 2151274 This is not the<br />time or the place
2151400 2154944 to perform some kind of a<br />half-assed autopsy on a fish.
2155821 2159532 And I am not going to stand<br />here and see that thing cut open
2159616 2163494 and see that little Kintner<br />boy spill out all over the dock.

2352476 2353935 Give us a kiss.
2354019 2355144 Why?
2357731 2359482 Because I need it.
2360150 2361776 (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
2363779 2365446 Get out of here.
2366573 2367698 ELLEN: Can I help you?
2367783 2369427 HOOPER: The door was<br />open. Mind if I come in?
2369451 2370993 I'm Matt Hooper.
2371078 2372537 Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.
2372621 2374121 Your husband's home? Yes.
2374206 2375831 I'd really like to talk to him.
2375916 2377500 Yes, so would I.
2378460 2380711 Come in. Can I get<br />you some coffee?
2380796 2382004 No. Nothing, thank you.
2382089 2383756 Oh, wine. How nice.
2402693 2404360 How was your day?
2405696 2407321 (BOTH LAUGHING)
2410242 2411450 Swell.
2414663 2417498 I got red and white. I didn't<br />know what you'd be serving.
2417583 2419041 Oh, that's nice.
2420335 2422295 Is anyone eating this?
2422379 2423588 No.
2431805 2434515 My husband tells<br />me you're in sharks.
2435434 2436559 (LAUGHS)
2437144 2440146 Excuse me. Yes. I've never<br />heard it quite put that way.
2440230 2441731 But yes, I am.
2442190 2443482 I love sharks.
2443567 2444609 You love sharks?
2444693 2446027 Yeah, I love them.
2446111 2448362 When I was 12 years old,<br />my father got me a boat
2448447 2450197 and I went fishing<br />off of Cape Cod.
2450282 2452450 I hooked a scup and<br />as I was reeling it in
2452534 2455369 I hooked a 4.5 foot<br />baby thresher shark
2455454 2457079 who proceeded to eat my boat.
2458582 2462209 He ate my oar, hooks,<br />and my seat cushions.
2462294 2463730 He turned an inboard<br />into an outboard
2463754 2467089 scared me to death,<br />and I swam back to shore.
2467174 2469634 When I was on the<br />beach, I turned around
2469718 2471677 and actually saw my<br />boat being taken apart.
2471762 2474347 Ever since then, I have<br />been studying sharks
2474431 2478184 and that's why I know that I'm<br />going to go to the Institute tomorrow
2478268 2480853 and tell them that you still<br />have a shark problem here.
2480979 2482897 Why do you have to<br />tell them that? Sorry.
2482981 2484607 I'm sorry, I thought that...
2484691 2485983 You told me the<br />shark was caught.
2486068 2488653 I heard it on the news. I<br />heard it on the Cape station.
2488737 2491322 They caught a<br />shark, not the shark.
2491823 2494408 Not the shark that<br />killed Chrissie Watkins.
2494618 2497286 And probably not the<br />shark that killed the little boy.
2497371 2500164 Which I wanted to prove<br />today by cutting the shark open...
2500248 2503334 You may want to let<br />that breathe... Nothing.
2519935 2523270 You know, you'll be<br />the only rational man
2523355 2525064 left on this island<br />after I leave tomorrow.
2525774 2527316 Where are you going?
2528610 2530361 I am going on the Aurora.
2530445 2531862 The Aurora? What is that?
2531947 2534865 It's a floating asylum<br />for shark addicts.
2534950 2536992 It's pure research,<br />18 months at sea.
2537411 2540955 Martin hates boats.<br />Martin hates water.
2541581 2545668 Martin sits in his car when we<br />go on the ferry to the mainland.
2545961 2547962 I guess it's a childhood thing.
2548046 2549766 There's a clinical<br />name for it, isn't there?
2549798 2551257 Drowning.
2552008 2553968 Is it true that most<br />people get attacked
2554052 2556303 by sharks in three feet of water
2556388 2558013 about 10 feet from the beach?
2558098 2559181 Yeah.
2559766 2563310 And that before people<br />started to swim for recreation...
2563395 2566564 I mean, before sharks<br />knew what they were missing
2566648 2569942 that a lot of these<br />attacks weren't reported?
2570026 2571277 That's right.
2573363 2576157 Now this shark that swims alone
2576283 2577450 what's it called? Rogue.
2577534 2578951 Rogue, yeah.
2579411 2582496 This guy, he keeps<br />swimming around
2582581 2584373 in a place where<br />the feeding is good
2584458 2586333 until the food<br />supply is gone, right?
2586418 2587918 That's called territoriality.
2588003 2591255 It's just a theory that I<br />happen to agree with.
2593842 2595426 Then why don't we<br />have one more drink
2595510 2598012 and go down and<br />cut that shark open?
2598513 2601223 Martin? Can you do that?
2605061 2608063 I can do anything.<br />I'm the Chief of Police.

2649856 2650981 (EXCLAIMS)
2651066 2652149 Just like I thought.
2652234 2653234 What?
2654236 2657571 Came up in the Gulf<br />Stream, from southern waters.
2662869 2664161 He didn't eat a car, did he?
2664246 2665371 No.
2665705 2668457 Tiger shark's like a<br />garbage can. It'll eat anything.
2668542 2671502 Somebody probably<br />threw that in the river.
2671795 2673546 (PANTING)
2677801 2679176 That's it.
2681012 2684098 I've got to close the<br />beach, call the Mayor.
2684933 2687309 You got a bigger<br />problem than that, Martin.
2687394 2689937 You still got a hell<br />of a fish out there
2690021 2691814 with a mouth about this big.
2696319 2698487 How do we confirm<br />that by morning?
2699322 2703325 If he is a rogue, and there's<br />any truth to territoriality at all
2703410 2705202 we got a good<br />chance of spotting him
2705287 2706996 between Cape Scott<br />and South Beach.
2707080 2708205 Where are you going?
2708290 2709707 To find him. He's<br />a night feeder.
2709833 2710833 On the water?
2710917 2712418 We're not gonna<br />find him on the land.
2712502 2713938 I'm not drunk enough<br />to go on a boat.
2713962 2715004 Yes, you are.
2715088 2716380 No, I'm not. Yes, you are.
2716464 2717923 I can't do that. Yes, you can.
2722679 2724179 (BOAT ENGINE WHIRRING)
2727100 2730728 I'm telling you, the crime<br />rate in New York will kill you.
2730812 2734732 There's so many problems, you never<br />feel like you're accomplishing anything.
2734816 2737818 Violence, rip-offs, muggings.

2739154 2741280 You've got to walk<br />them to school.
2741364 2744366 But in Amity, one man<br />can make a difference.
2744868 2747077 In 25 years, there's never been
2747162 2748829 a shooting or a<br />murder in this town.
2749706 2752207 No kidding? Want a pretzel?
2752959 2754168 Where are we?
2754252 2757254 We're right in the stretch<br />where he's been feeding.
2759716 2761592 Can you get <i>The Late<br />Show</i> on this thing?
2761676 2763260 No, it's a closed<br />circuit TV system.
2763345 2765888 I have underwater<br />cameras fore-and-aft.
2766514 2768223 Who pays for all this stuff?
2768308 2769725 The government? The Institute?
2769809 2771852 This stuff costs a lot of money.
2773396 2775773 I paid for this mostly<br />myself, actually.
2775857 2777650 You're kidding. No.
2778318 2779985 You rich? Yeah.
2780779 2782154 How much?
2782238 2783739 Personally, or the whole family?
2785200 2789328 Doesn't make any sense. They<br />pay a guy like you to watch sharks?
2789746 2793207 Well, it doesn't<br />make sense for a guy
2793291 2795171 who hates the water to<br />live on an island either.
2795627 2798712 It's only an island if you<br />look at it from the water.
2798964 2800756 That makes a lot of sense.
2806721 2808472 BRODY: What is that thing doing?
2809849 2811892 Well, it's a fish finder.
2811977 2814061 It's probably just a school<br />of mackerel or something,

2816231 2818107 (RADAR BEEPING)
2818650 2820192 Wait a minute.
2824656 2826407 There's something<br />else out there.

3022645 3024730 This is a great white,<br />Larry. A big one.
3024814 3027691 Any shark expert will tell<br />you it's a killer, a man-eater.
3027775 3030527 The situation is that<br />apparently a great white shark
3030612 3032905 has staked a claim in<br />the waters off Amity Island.
3032989 3036200 He'll continue to feed here as<br />long as there's food in the water.
3036284 3037868 There's no limit<br />to what he'll do.
3037952 3039328 We've had three incidents.
3039412 3041830 Two people killed within<br />a week. It'll happen again.
3041915 3043999 It happened before.<br />The Jersey beach, 1916.
3044125 3046043 Five people were<br />killed... In one week.
3046127 3047377 Tell him about the swimmers.
3047462 3050714 A shark is attracted to the exact<br />kind of splashing and activity
3050798 3053634 that occurs whenever human<br />beings swim. You can't avoid it.
3053718 3057387 Opening the beaches on the Fourth<br />of July is like ringing the dinner bell.
3057472 3058847 Look, Mr. Vaughn
3058932 3061642 I pulled a tooth the<br />size of a shot glass
3061726 3063329 out of the wrecked<br />hull of a boat out there.
3063353 3064853 It was the tooth<br />of a great white.
3064938 3066605 It was Gardner's<br />boat, all chewed up.
3066689 3068982 I helped tow it in.<br />You should've seen it!
3069067 3071818 Where is that tooth?<br />Did you see it, Brody?
3072195 3073881 I didn't see it. He<br />dropped it on the way in.
3073905 3075948 I had an accident.
3076115 3079284 And what did you say<br />the name of this shark is?
3080620 3083538 <i>It's a Carcharodon<br />carcharias.</i> It's a great white.
3083748 3085707 You don't have the tooth?
3086960 3089795 Look, we depend on the<br />summer people for our very lives...
3089879 3092965 You won't have a summer<br />unless you deal with this problem!
3093049 3096218 We have to close the beach<br />and hire someone to kill the shark!
3096302 3098095 We have to tell the Coast Guard.
3098179 3101139 You'll have to contact<br />the Shark Research Panel.
3101224 3103517 You'll have to ring<br />this entire harbor!
3103601 3105310 I don't think either one of you
3105395 3107104 are familiar with our problems!
3107188 3109398 I think that I am<br />familiar with the fact
3109482 3111650 that you'll ignore<br />this particular problem
3111734 3114069 until it swims up and<br />bites you in the ass!
3114153 3117155 Wait a second ! There are two<br />ways to deal with this problem!
3117240 3120367 You either kill this animal<br />or cut off its food supply.
3120451 3122327 BRODY: We have<br />to close the beaches.
3122412 3123537 Brody?
3124122 3126164 Sick vandalism.
3126249 3130335 That is a deliberate mutilation<br />of a public service message.

3133631 3135340 and hung up by<br />their Buster Browns.

3138553 3139822 who's lining up<br />to be a hot lunch.
3139846 3141138 I'm gonna see you later, Brody.
3141222 3143307 Don't do this. He's not...
3149939 3154776 What we are dealing with here is a<br />perfect engine, an eating machine.
3155361 3157070 It's really a<br />miracle of evolution.
3157155 3160991 All this machine<br />does is swim and eat
3161242 3163744 and make little<br />sharks. And that's all.
3163953 3166747 Why don't you take a<br />long, close look at this sign?
3166831 3168999 Those proportions are correct.

4676464 4679174 Maybe you're a<br />big yahoo in the lab,
4679259 4680611 but out here you're<br />just supercargo!
4680635 4683387 If you don't want to backstroke<br />home, you get down here!
4683471 4686390 You don't want to listen<br />to me, don't listen to me.
4686474 4687683 It's not a shark.
4687767 4689810 The wire's showing.
4689894 4691353 Unbuckle me.
4692272 4693856 Get the other side.
4693940 4695482 It's a tuna or swordfish
4696234 4697901 wasting our time.
4698611 4700112 Take this rod.
4700196 4701864 Hooper, give the<br />Chief a hand, will you?
4701948 4702990 Right!
4703074 4704116 Oh, shit!
4714294 4717004 It may be a marlin or a stingray
4717630 4719840 but it's definitely a game fish.
4731603 4732978 Gaming fish?
4733688 4737065 Marlin, stingray bit<br />through this piano wire?
4737150 4738859 Don't you tell me<br />my business again.
4739152 4740212 You get back on the bridge.
4740236 4742779 Quint, that doesn't<br />prove a damn thing.
4742864 4744990 It proves one thing, Mr. Hooper.
4745074 4748243 You wealthy college boys<br />don't have the education enough
4748328 4750078 to admit if you're wrong.
4759464 4762215 What's the point?<br />Hooks and lines?
4764677 4767137 You lose one, you rig one.
4767931 4769514 (ENGINE REVVING)
4771643 4774311 Twelve minutes,<br />south-southeast, now! Full throttle!
4774395 4775896 Aye-aye, sir!
4778024 4781318 You see, what I do, Chief,<br />is I trick them to the surface.
4781736 4783445 And then I jab at them.
4783738 4787199 I'm not going to haul<br />them up like a lot of catfish.
4787492 4789117 Hooper, full throttle!
4789202 4791870 I don't have to take<br />this abuse much longer.
4792038 4794998 Your head's bleeding.<br />First aid there.
4823736 4826405 Start that chum<br />line again, will you?
4828574 4830701 Let Hooper take a turn.
4830785 4832703 Hooper drives the boat, Chief.
4848219 4850512 Stop playing with<br />yourself, Hooper.
4850596 4852264 Slow ahead, if you please.
4853099 4855183 You heard him. Slow ahead.
4863943 4865193 Slow ahead.
4865611 4869531 I can go slow ahead. Come on<br />down and chum some of this shit.

4934263 4935472 That's a 20-footer.

4947193 4948610 Gotta get to work.
4949153 4951446 How do we handle this?
4951531 4953698 Come up front,<br />Martin. I need you.
4955701 4957661 He's circling the boat.

4985731 4986971 Beyond the edge of the barrels.
4987024 4990068 Go to the end of the<br />barrels, further out.
4990194 4991736 Further out! Why?
4991821 4993572 Go further out! What for?
4993698 4995407 Will you go to the<br />end of the pulpit?
4995491 4996491 What?
4996576 4997719 Will you go to the<br />end of the pulpit?
4997743 5000662 I need something in the<br />foreground to give it some scale!

5002081 5003999 Your husband's<br />okay. He's fishing.
5004083 5005250 He just caught some stripers.
5005334 5009087 We'll bring them for dinner. We<br />ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out.
5009255 5010589 I'm not staying here!
5010673 5011673 I'm begging you!

5016095 5018263 (HEROIC INSTRUMENTAL<br />MUSIC PLAYING)
5020349 5022684 Chief, I want you<br />up on the bridge,
5022768 5024019 just take her forward, steady.
5024103 5025562 I've never steered<br />a boat in my life.
5025646 5028398 Just watch my<br />hand, take her steady.
5028900 5032360 Mr. Hooper, attach the end<br />of this line to the first keg.
5032570 5035447 I've got to get a good<br />shot at that porker's head.

5050963 5053256 He's coming.

5060806 5062224 Hurry up, will you?
5062308 5063475 Your turn, Quint.
5064143 5065685 Hooper, where are you?
5069649 5071650 Hurry it up now, tie it on.
5072860 5075403 He's coming straight for<br />us. Don't screw it up now.
5075488 5076988 Don't wait for me.
5079492 5082494 Come on, Hooper,<br />hurry it up! Tie it on!
5083329 5084663 Now.

5101055 5102491 QUINT: What were you<br />doing? You knew I had
5102515 5104933 to get a clean shot<br />right in the head.
5105017 5108645 All right, let's see how long<br />that barrel takes to bring him up.

5169457 5173460 We got one barrel on him. We<br />stay out here until we find him again.
5173586 5176212 We could radio in<br />and get a bigger boat...
5176464 5178506 (QUINT WHISTLING)
5201280 5203365 Don't you worry about it, Chief.
5204283 5207619 It won't be permanent. You<br />want to see something permanent?
5210414 5211831 (LAUGHS)
5214960 5217796 You want to feel<br />something permanent?
5218964 5222967 Just put your hand underneath<br />my cap. You feel that little lump?
5223052 5226221 Knocko Nolans, St.<br />Patty's Day, Boston.
5230559 5232227 I got that beat.
5240152 5243655 It's a moray eel. It bit<br />right through my wet suit.
5244740 5246741 Well, Hoop, now, listen
5246826 5250078 I don't know about that, but I<br />entered an arm-wrestling contest
5250162 5252914 in a bar in San<br />Francisco. See this?
5252998 5254541 I can't extend that.<br />You know why?
5254875 5256876 'Cause in the semi-final
5257044 5259879 celebrating my<br />third wife's demise,
5259964 5261923 big Chinese fellow,<br />he pulled me right over.
5262133 5263550 (LAUGHS)
5274854 5276354 Look at that.
5278023 5279566 That's a bull shark.
5280025 5282527 He scraped me when<br />I was taking samples.
5283362 5285363 I got something for you.
5286073 5289534 There's a thresher. You<br />see that? A thresher's tail.
5289702 5291744 Thresher? It's a shark.
5294707 5296791 You want a drink?<br />Drink to your leg?
5296876 5297876 I'll drink to your leg.
5297960 5300044 So we drink to our<br />legs. (LAUGHS)
5305259 5308553 I got <i>the crème de la<br />crème.</i> Right here. Hold on.
5309597 5311306 Here, you see that?
5311724 5313433 You're wearing a sweater.
5314226 5316561 Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit.

5331410 5332660 QUINT: What?
5332745 5334204 That one, there. On your arm.
5335581 5336873 Oh.
5336957 5338500 A tattoo. I got that removed.
5338584 5340293 Don't tell me.
5341128 5342462 "Mother." (LAUGHS)
5348093 5349469 What is it?
5354475 5357644 Mr. Hooper, that's<br /><i>the U.S.S. Indianapolis.</i>
5365194 5367153 You were <i>on the Indianapolis?</i>
5367321 5368613 What happened?
5370616 5374661 Japanese submarine slammed<br />two torpedoes into her side, Chief.
5375996 5379874 I was coming back from<br />the island of Tinian to Leyte
5379959 5383086 just delivered the bomb,<br />the Hiroshima bomb.
5386257 5389008 1 , 100 men went into the water.
5389093 5390927 Vessel went down in 12 minutes.
5393305 5396224 Didn't see the first shark<br />for about half an hour.
5396475 5398393 Tiger, 13-footer.
5398477 5401354 You know how you know that<br />when you're in the water, Chief?
5401438 5404691 You tell by looking<br />from the dorsal to the tail.
5406277 5408152 Well, we didn't know.
5408529 5411656 Because our bomb<br />mission had been so secret
5412449 5414826 no distress signal<br />had been sent.
5415911 5417161 (CHUCKLES)
5421500 5424544 They didn't even list<br />us overdue for a week.
5426005 5429507 Very first light,<br />sharks come cruising
5430009 5432927 so we formed ourselves<br />into tight groups.
5433804 5436639 You know, kind<br />of like old squares
5436724 5438308 in a battle like you<br />see on a calendar
5438392 5441185 like the Battle of<br />Waterloo. The idea was...
5441270 5442895 the shark comes<br />to the nearest man
5442980 5445773 and he starts pounding,<br />hollering and screaming.
5445858 5448484 Sometimes the<br />shark would go away...
5449445 5451446 but sometimes he<br />wouldn't go away.
5451530 5455783 Sometimes that shark, he looks<br />right into you, right into your eyes.
5455951 5457220 (SLOW INSTRUMENTAL<br />MUSIC PLAYING)
5457244 5459871 You know, a thing<br />about a shark, he's got...
5460331 5464334 lifeless eyes. Black<br />eyes, like a doll's eyes.
5465961 5469464 When he comes at you,<br />he doesn't seem to be living
5469798 5474719 until he bites you. Those black<br />eyes roll over white and then...
5476221 5479724 Then you hear that terrible<br />high-pitched screaming.
5480142 5482060 The ocean turns red.
5482478 5486314 In spite of the pounding and<br />the hollering, they all come in.
5488025 5489734 They rip you to pieces.
5489985 5492195 (GRAVE INSTRUMENTAL<br />MUSIC PLAYING)
5494573 5497575 You know, by the<br />end of that first dawn...
5498744 5500370 we lost 100 men.
5501872 5504415 I don't know how many<br />sharks. Maybe 1 ,000.
5504541 5507585 I don't know how many men,<br />they averaged six an hour.
5508212 5511172 On Thursday morning, I<br />bumped into a friend of mine...
5511256 5513675 Herbie Robinson, from Cleveland.
5514885 5517512 Baseball player, bosun's mate.
5519598 5523643 I thought he was asleep.<br />Reached over to wake him up.
5525270 5529107 He bobbed up and down in<br />the water just like a kind of top.
5529775 5531067 Upended.
5535114 5537782 He'd been bitten in<br />half, below the waist.
5541620 5545707 Noon the fifth day, a<br />Lockheed Ventura saw us.
5545791 5548918 He swung in low and he<br />saw us. He was a young pilot.
5549002 5550211 Younger than Mr. Hooper.
5550295 5553131 He saw us and he came in<br />low, and three hours later...
5553257 5556718 a big fat PBY comes down<br />and starts to pick us up.
5556802 5559637 That was the time I<br />was most frightened.
5560305 5562140 Waiting for my turn.
5563517 5566269 I'll never put on<br />a life jacket again.
5567980 5570440 So, 1 , 100 men<br />went into the water
5571150 5573067 316 men come out.
5573152 5577113 The sharks took the<br />rest, June 29, 1945.
5580075 5583828 Anyway, we delivered the bomb.

5927923 5931675 You're certifiable, Quint, you<br />know that? You're certifiable!
5932010 5933803 You're certifiable,<br />but I'll tell you this!
5933887 5935179 Boys,
5936848 5939517 I think he's come back<br />for his noon feeding.
5941019 5942812 Hook me up another barrel.
5943355 5945356 (TENSE INSTRUMENTAL<br />MUSIC PLAYING)
5973426 5975261 Bring her around after him.
5978682 5981016 (LIGHT INSTRUMENTAL<br />MUSIC PLAYING)
5992112 5994572 Full throttle! Get me<br />right up alongside of him!
5994698 5997950 I can't rev it up that high,<br />it's not going to take it!
5998243 6001078 (ADVENTUROUS<br />INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
6015677 6017261 Five degrees port.
6024144 6026103 All right, hold your course.
6032444 6034361 Five degrees port now.
6037866 6039283 Hold your course.
6040952 6042203 Fast fish.
6042287 6043454 QUINT: Watch my hand.
6044664 6048209 Be sure you watch<br />my hand ! Follow me.
6049461 6052046 Lad, you watch<br />him now! Starboard!
6053298 6055132 Run him down, Hooper.
6062307 6063641 Hard aport.
6067479 6069146 Watch him. Starboard.
6079324 6081367 (TENSE INSTRUMENTAL<br />MUSIC PLAYING)
6093964 6097299 I can't believe it. Two barrels<br />and he's going down again.
6102931 6104348 It's incredible.
6110397 6112314 They're up again ! Now what?
6121574 6123951 Why don't we lead<br />the shark into shore
6124035 6125828 instead of him<br />leading us out to sea?
6130292 6132001 Grab a couple of poles.
6134296 6136422 Hang on now, we're going around.
6137215 6139717 Into starboard. Easy.
6140677 6142720 I'm going to back her off now.
6142804 6144596 Watch those barrels,<br />boys. Watch them.
6149144 6151228 All right, gentlemen, snag them.
6156484 6158861 Now then, tie them<br />to the stern cleats.
6162115 6164742 Brody, bring your<br />end around the cleat.
6165785 6169330 That's right, it'll lock itself<br />off. Give him room, Brody.
6170290 6171332 (GROANING)
6171416 6173125 Stay clear of the line!
6180884 6182593 Watch it. Stand clear.
6192729 6195230 Stand away from<br />those stern cleats!
6208370 6210454 Back home we got<br />a taxidermy man.
6210538 6211997 He's going to<br />have a heart attack
6212082 6214750 when he sees what I<br />brought him. (LAUGHS)
6220632 6223467 Throttle back.<br />You're losing a cleat.
6226179 6228847 My God, this one,<br />too. They're both going.
6229099 6231016 He's eating his way<br />through that line.
6231101 6232976 He's working his<br />way right up to us.
6233103 6235938 Quint! Come on, Quint. Hurry!
6238483 6239775 Out of my way.
6244989 6245989 Watch it.
6250036 6252663 Untie this. He'll<br />pull out the transom.
6256501 6258460 Make it fast! We got<br />another line in him!
6258545 6260504 I can't, it's trying to run!
6261881 6263590 BRODY: We better<br />get another line!
6263675 6265676 QUINT: Pull, you son of a bitch!
6265969 6268178 I hope your back breaks!
6268263 6270139 Go ahead. Pull<br />your bloody heart out.
6270807 6272182 Tie him off!
6277355 6279690 It's impossible!
6280900 6282568 Boys, it's too tight!
6283027 6284820 HOOPER: He's pulling us!
6286739 6288657 We're breaking up over here!
6295248 6297541 We're breaking up! Cut it!
6298376 6299835 BRODY: Watch your hands!
6301212 6303255 HOOPER: Cut it<br />quick. I can't hold it!
6311264 6313056 (HOOPER PANTING)
6324402 6326778 He can't stay down<br />with three barrels on him.
6326905 6329072 Not with three<br />barrels, he can't.
6329240 6330741 What about us?
6331284 6334953 Hooper, get the pump out of<br />the locker in front of you, will you?
6335413 6337164 We're going to sink, aren't we?
6337248 6340209 Keep an eye on the<br />barrels. Pump it out, Chief.
6340585 6342628 (MENACING INSTRUMENTAL<br />MUSIC PLAYING)
6346716 6348258 HOOPER: Starting to go under.
6348426 6351887 He can't with three barrels<br />on him. Not with three he can't.
6386756 6388924 You ever have<br />one do this before?

6431759 6434261 I'm going to draw<br />him into the shallows.
6434345 6435614 Draw him into the shallow water.
6435638 6438432 I'm going to draw<br />him in and drown him.
6438683 6439891 We're heading in, Brody.
6439976 6441143 Thank Christ!
6448943 6450087 You ever had a<br />great white do that?

6626537 6629915 What exactly can you do<br />with these things of yours?
6633753 6637839 I think I can pump 20 cc of<br />strychnine nitrate into him.
6638216 6640425 If I can get close enough.
6642887 6645388 Get this little needle<br />through his skin?
6647183 6648767 No, I can't do that.
6650728 6652646 If I can get him<br />close to the cage,
6652730 6653897 I can get him in the mouth.
6653981 6655541 That shark will rip<br />that cage to pieces.
6655608 6658026 You got any better suggestions?
