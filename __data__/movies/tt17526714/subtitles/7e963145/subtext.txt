360483 361483 Oh, thank you.
362083 363068 Happy birthday.
363093 364093 Thank you.
384720 386326 I don't care if we need to see
386351 388653 every fucking young girl<br />in this fucking town
388978 390266 in the next few weeks.
390936 393251 Look, I'll make it simple.
393821 395279 We need her young.
395707 397374 We need her hot.
397879 399130 We need her now.
400583 403416 How the old bitch has been able<br />to stick around for this long...
403441 405671 That's the fucking mystery to me.
407004 409330 Oh, Oscar winner, my ass.
409791 411333 When was that back in the 30s?
411358 413618 What, for King Kong?
416798 421166 No, I don't give a<br />fuck what we promised her.
422000 423454 This is network TV,
423716 424927 not a fucking charity.
426366 428187 Find me somebody new.
429000 430000 Now.
431393 433524 Hey, did you know that a woman's
433556 436594 fertility starts to<br />decrease about the age of 25?
437153 438388 How old is Jennifer?
438824 440625 You better get busy.
477891 480569 It's like when you see<br />someone fart on screen.
485542 486802 People just love that.
487582 489228 I mean, that's just the way it is.
491291 492291 So you know what I mean?
492541 494022 People are just people.
494250 497792 And I have to give people what they want.
498111 499861 That's what keeps the shareholders happy.
500291 503350 And people always ask for something new.
504528 507512 Renewal is inevitable.
508865 511207 And at 50, well...
513225 514145 it stops.
515073 516323 What stops?
517209 518209 What?
518791 519791 What stops?
521745 524609 Um, you know, the um...
528001 528750 The um...

537292 538292 Harvey!
538791 541668 George, those ratings are insane!
542879 544295 You're a genius!
544375 546347 Oh, what a mess. You're a genius.
547854 549175 That's why you've been drinking.
549200 550200 Oh, that's hilarious.
599687 601645 Well, it's your lucky day, Miss Sparkle,
601670 603725 because we have<br />X-rayed you from head to toe,
603750 605786 and you don't have so<br />much as a cracked molar.
605958 608260 So, you are good to go.
609350 611650 Uh, vaccination, okay.
611875 613742 Not going on a vacation.
614916 616323 By the way, I just want to say:
616435 618903 my wife is a huge fan.
620991 621926 Um...
622545 624019 blood type...
624375 625959 Oh, hey, it's your birthday.

637125 639391 Oh, uh, that's an emergency, I'm sorry.
639416 640594 I, uh, have to....
640808 642335 Have a... um....
642927 643927 Bye.
651375 652375 One moment.
653634 655509 There's just one last exam to perform.
656001 657792 I thought he said I was good to go.
679572 680572 Is there a problem?
680750 681600 No, it's perfect.
682518 683392 You're a good candidate.
684457 686037 I mean, you're good to go.
690639 691639 I wish you the best.

762236 764828 Why don't we go out<br />maybe for a drink sometime
764852 766925 now that we're,<br />you know, reconnected?
767012 768012 Um...
768750 770416 Oh, of course, I'm stupid.
770441 771315 You're super busy.
771340 771767 You know what?
772079 774382 Why don't you give me your card?
774541 775822 I mean, you never know.
775858 777438 Um, sure, what I...
778438 779745 This'll do. Oh...
780338 781725 Don't look at my cholesterol levels.
781750 782750 They're a disaster.
786061 786996 Oh, God.

3773341 3774933 There's been a slight...
3775080 3777120 misuse of the substance.
3777746 3783609 A few extra hours<br />were accidentally used...
3783951 3785343 causing, um...
3786892 3788256 an alteration.
3789579 3791666 So I'm just looking for<br />the procedure to reverse it.

4261748 4263330 been really busy lately.
4264076 4265330 So listen...
4265615 4267668 I was thinking that...
4269651 4272500 maybe we could get<br />together and grab a drink.
4278286 4279286 Are you still there?
4280287 4282390 <i>Sorry, I-I'm in shock again.</i>
4285460 4288046 <i>I could book Luigi's, at eight?</i>
4288953 4290986 Eight at Luigi's it is.
4293025 4294665 I will see you tonight.
4295880 4296746 <i>Bye.</i>
4296934 4298360 Okay, bye.
4592021 4594814 <i>And we're back!<br />Welcome back to Who Knows!</i>
4594960 4596933 <i>Father Judy, are you ready?</i>
4596989 4598582 <i>Well now you've seen the scales.</i>
4598849 4601095 <i>Who Knows is the show<br />where you keep your eye on—</i>
4602960 4603854 Hi everybody.
4604210 4605067 Hi!
4605210 4606744 Okay, here we go everyone.
4606769 4607769 Clear the set please.
4607892 4609504 First positions, thank you.
4609555 4610555 Roll cameras.
4611375 4614666 And in three, two, one.
4617830 4620380 And squat, squat, squat.
4621750 4622750 Circle those hips.
4623750 4624750 Circle those hips.
4625500 4628065 Contract, contract, contract,
4628120 4630460 contract, contract, contract.
4631162 4632870 Head between your legs.
4638995 4639995 Cut.
4643971 4645941 I'm sorry, I thought I, uh...
4646552 4648366 thought I— I—
4649359 4650459 I just got distracted.
4651720 4653233 Not a problem, let's<br />get right back to it.
4653826 4654826 Back to one please.
4657981 4659469 Sorry, it's the control room now.
4659760 4662208 The director said he saw something<br />bizarre on the monitor.
4662299 4663659 Bring up the replay on camera two.
4663920 4664920 Camera two.
4676061 4677061 Forward.
4683275 4684395 Can I have my dressing gown?
4684593 4685580 Sorry, it's in your dressing room.
4685667 4686580 Well then go and get it.
4687767 4689122 Let's just take this frame by frame.
4703763 4704830 I need five minutes.
4823790 4825710 - <i>Yes.</i><br />- This balance is not working.
4826277 4828360 I barely have any time to enjoy myself
4828385 4831371 while she wastes seven days
4831396 4833164 stuffing her face in front of the TV.
4833189 4835225 <i>Remember there is no she and you.</i>
4835250 4836031 <i>You are—</i>
4838303 4840784 Hello, everybody.
4845460 4847042 What's happening?<br />Where is everybody?
4847238 4848522 The taping's been canceled.
4849900 4850765 What, why?
4850790 4851662 Sue.
4852416 4854176 Harvey wants to see you<br />in his office immediately.
4855363 4856363 Okay.
4856817 4857790 I'll go change and—
4857815 4859237 No, he said now.
4877009 4878302 I'll get right to the point.
4879593 4881602 We can't keep you on the morning show.
4882971 4884016 But why?
4884041 4885198 I just started.
4886001 4888086 Ratings are through the roof.
4889092 4890839 We started at 42.
4891626 4893040 Now we're up to like...
4894039 4895039 216.
4895174 4897580 It's phenomenal.
4898808 4900210 People love you.
4900666 4902355 They adore you.
4902380 4905325 They want more and more and more of you.
4905798 4907433 That is why we have decided...
4907887 4910392 that we want you to host...
4911391 4913201 the New Year's Eve show.
4914131 4915336 You mean the...
4915361 4916979 The network's biggest show.
4917283 4919525 50 million viewers live.
4919589 4921589 You can't go higher than that.
4924416 4925540 That's gonna be intense.
4925698 4928320 We only have a few<br />months to pull it off, so...
4928732 4930428 are you in?
4941530 4943584 If you don't open the<br />door when opportunity knocks,
4943608 4944835 you won't get another chance.
4946699 4948275 You of all people know this.
4961176 4963131 Just one more day and<br />then I have a whole week off.
4963156 4964080 We can switch.
4982349 4983861 We're doing the cover of Vogue.
4985564 4986564 Just one more day, okay?
5055045 5055830 <i>Yes.</i>
5056011 5057935 She didn't respect the balance.
5058558 5061170 She's stealing more<br />and more time from me,
5061394 5065145 completely without<br />consideration of the consequences.
5065292 5066670 She's a selfish bitch.
5067000 5068000 <i>Would you like to stop?</i>
5071050 5071750 Stop?
5072062 5073314 <i>You are the matrix.</i>
5073851 5075351 <i>If you are not satisfied,</i>
5075377 5077272 <i>you can put an end to the experience</i>
5077297 5079958 <i>and go back to being<br />just you on your own.</i>
5080395 5081395 <i>Would you like to stop?</i>
5084526 5086944 Will it go back to the way it was before?
5087143 5089349 <i>What has been<br />transferred won't come back,</i>
5089467 5091817 <i>but you can stop the<br />experience as of now.</i>
5091841 5093134 <i>Would you like to stop?</i>
5093426 5096165 <i>To go back to being just you on your own?</i>
5098902 5099902 No.
5102411 5103453 No, no, no.
5104080 5105179 I can't stop.
5107029 5107750 She just...
5109935 5110708 I...
5116330 5118497 The balance just needs to be respected.
5118666 5119666 <i>So respect it.</i>
5123580 5126400 Stop it, stop it,<br />stop it, stop it, stop it.
5135886 5137390 <i>You are the winner!</i>
5137885 5140875 <i>Well, Bob, congratulations,<br />you've won $25,000.</i>
5141186 5144433 <i>Now you have one final chance to<br />answer a simple question</i>
5144458 5148958 <i>in our big question<br />round and play for $250,000.</i>
5152291 5155855 <i>And you'll have just 45<br />seconds to come to a conclusion.</i>
5155880 5157890 <i>Answer correctly<br />as best you can...</i>
5213488 5215819 Just a little something to keep you busy.
5228386 5229386 Fuck.
5256513 5258909 Yes, ladies and gentlemen, she is here.
5259350 5262897 The superstar of the moment, Sue.
5263039 5263843 Are you ready?
5263868 5265957 Let's welcome her, Sue.
5267993 5273210 You popped up out of nowhere on<br />our screens like a tornado.
5273235 5276750 I don't think anybody was<br />really prepared for this whirlwind .
5283950 5287245 It all started with the morning show
5287383 5292275 and rumor has it that you are<br />up for Tom Grant's next movie.
5294597 5296014 Wait, just a moment.
5296769 5300565 I'm being told that you are going to host<br />the New Year's Eve show.
5300590 5301590 Can you confirm this?
5302290 5303239 Yes, that's right.
5303376 5304376 <i>"Yes, that's right."</i>
5307500 5310322 Oh my God, that is huge news.
5313584 5314935 Tell us a little bit about yourself.
5315052 5316019 Where are you from?
5316044 5317580 How did you get discovered?
5317759 5320887 I want— We want to know everything.
5323620 5326391 Well, I mean, there's...
5326416 5328120 really not very much to tell.
5328743 5331137 I'm just a girl from a...
5331563 5333666 very small town in Indiana.
5333916 5335476 I'm sure that<br />you've never heard of it.
5335798 5337890 In fact, it's not even a town.
5337915 5340326 I'm not sure you could<br />really even call it a village.
5341752 5343152 It's a farm, perhaps?
5350379 5352095 But ever since I can remember,
5352120 5355321 it has always been my<br />dream to be on screen.
5355891 5357990 This is my dream.
5358080 5360145 As a child, I used to<br />put on shows for my family.
5360596 5362077 Mm, your family.
5362608 5363710 How sweet.
5366670 5370185 So, everyone is aware...
5370210 5373445 that you replaced Elizabeth Sparkle.
5374628 5377753 And no doubt about it, you stepped in,
5377810 5379492 you turned up the volume,
5379517 5381546 and you rocked their world.
5381932 5383213 Were you a fan of her show?
5387830 5388841 Um...
5389780 5390855 Well...
5392266 5393827 Well, I can't, uh...
5394551 5398227 I can't really say that I<br />actually watched her show.
5399290 5402527 You do know that we're not exactly<br />from the same generation.
5403830 5406620 And you have to admit, it<br />was a bit old-fashioned.
5409624 5411028 Jurassic Fitness, really.
5411854 5413435 <i>"Jurassic Fitness"?</i>
5413460 5414420 It needed a change.
5416920 5418250 I'll fucking show you.
5419711 5421628 You wanna see<br />some Jurassic Fitness?
5424920 5425920 You want it?
5427039 5430147 Come on, come get your<br />fucking Jurassic Fitness!
5439250 5441580 But my mother was a huge fan of hers.
5443719 5445120 So, every morning...
5446047 5447080 rain or shine...
5448406 5449830 Sparkle Your Life was on TV.
5450880 5452213 So, in a way, I grew up with her.
5452936 5454186 Whether I liked it or not.
5455540 5458335 I guess that's why you could say<br />we have some sort of connection.
5458360 5460052 "Some sort of connection"?
5460268 5462893 You wouldn't exist without me.
5472984 5474338 Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
5474363 5478832 It is time, ladies and<br />gentlemen, for our final question.
5478862 5484201 The question that we ask each<br />and every one of our guests.
5484226 5485226 Okay.
5485386 5490170 Would you share one of your<br />little beauty secrets with us?
5491928 5496181 Just one little trick of yours that<br />helps you look so incredibly stunning.
5496206 5497128 I mean, look at you.
5497305 5499484 - I don't know, uh...<br />- Say it!
5499997 5500997 Say it!
5502327 5503838 - Let me think.<br />- Say it!
5504120 5506938 Tell them who your<br />little beauty secret is!
5506963 5509511 - I guess...<br />- Why don't we just show them right here.
5509750 5511377 Here's your little beauty secret.
5511483 5513210 I guess I just try to be myself.
5513515 5516330 To be sincere and<br />grateful for all that I have.
5516917 5519330 And to always remember<br />to lead with my heart.
5519517 5521475 Oh, I'm here at the sweetheart center.
5521500 5523030 We'll be back in a minute.
5531933 5536000 I just, oh, I try to be myself.
5537920 5538920 Stop it!
5539918 5540918 Stop it.
5541500 5543095 You're taking it from me.
5543506 5545135 That's your little secret.
5545828 5547094 Stop it!
5547420 5548250 Stop it!
5548375 5549725 Stop it! Stop it!
5549750 5550330 Stop it!
5550355 5561827 Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
5561852 5566457 You have to control yourself!
5586153 5587715 I can't go back to her.
5595920 5598405 Gross! Old! Fat!
5599670 5600670 Destructive!
5681314 5682314 Coming to bed?
5683776 5686223 Yes, I'll be right there.
5751302 5752067 <i>Yes.</i>
5752092 5753790 Hi, hi, this is emergency.
5753815 5755982 There's no more stabilizer fluid.
5758685 5759685 Hello?
5761293 5762791 It's fucking 503.
5762816 5763502 <i>Yes.</i>
5765067 5766277 I'm telling you, this is urgent.
5766302 5767723 There's no more stabilizer fluid.
5767820 5769298 <i>It means you've reached the end.</i>
5771811 5772968 What do you mean the end?
5773500 5774667 <i>You've drained it all out.</i>
5775142 5778041 <i>If you want more, you must<br />let the fluid regenerate.</i>
5778790 5779790 Tell me how to do it.
5779815 5782519 I need to stabilize myself right now.
5782861 5784386 <i>You simply have to switch.</i>
5787298 5788298 Excuse me?
5788546 5791416 <i>The switch reboots the<br />fluid secretion process</i>
5791441 5793796 <i>so you can continue to<br />enjoy the experience.</i>
5793821 5795799 No, no, no, no, no.
5796201 5797670 I can't switch, I can't.
5798351 5799480 Especially not now.
5799718 5801093 <i>There is no other option.</i>
5827993 5828993 Sue?
5841398 5842398 Babe?
5845573 5846573 Sue?
5847277 5848277 You all right?
5854290 5855666 Stressed out about tomorrow?
5861290 5862290 Babe?
5867500 5868120 Babe?
5876120 5878250 Sue? Is something wrong?
5883120 5885190 You a little cranky<br />because of your lady business?
5890118 5891118 Sue, open the door.
5892575 5893561 Come on, Sue.
5894048 5895836 It's not funny, I need to take a piss.
5897753 5899041 Sue, open the door.
5900000 5901445 Open the door, Sue, come on.
5920111 5921111 Sue!
5922763 5924290 Open the door! Come on!
5925601 5927367 Sue, open the door.
5927940 5929854 Sue, open the door!
5933280 5934559 What the fuck?
5935381 5937460 Get the fuck out!
5937713 5939855 Who's this? Who the fuck is this?
5939880 5941330 Leave me alone!
5950136 5952021 What the fuck?
6005112 6006132 <i>Yes.</i>
6009407 6011115 It's 503.
6012194 6013632 I want to stop.
6014030 6017367 <i>Are you sure? Once you<br />stop, you can't go back.</i>
6017510 6018920 I want to stop!
6019179 6021193 I want to fucking stop!
6021748 6023210 I want to stop!
6024201 6025201 <i>We'll deliver.</i>
6072469 6073330 Sue, I was—
6073355 6074057 Fuck off!
6155119 6156119 <i>Are you sure?</i>
6158612 6160645 <i>Once you stop, you can't go back.</i>
6161368 6163647 <i>You will simply remain on your own.</i>
6164625 6166913 <i>Just on your own.</i>
6168552 6172431 <i>Just on your own.</i>
6172456 6173945 Shut the fuck up!
6236152 6237152 Oh shit...
6238700 6239703 I can't...
6240436 6242156 I can't do this.
6245209 6246666 I need you.
6247374 6248421 Because...
6248654 6250440 I need myself.
6251660 6252673 We...
6253239 6257086 You gotta get ready.
6257110 6259397 It's our big night.
6260274 6262715 Come on. They're gonna love you so much.
6263920 6264710 Come on.
6266024 6266710 Come on.
6268395 6270207 You're the only lovable part of me.
6270232 6271814 You have to come back.
6272245 6273305 You have to come back!
6273330 6274120 Come back!
6290080 6291040 Okay. Okay.
6295387 6296250 Come on.
6298512 6299380 Come on.
6308858 6309580 Come on.
6475661 6476500 Oh, don't!
6672403 6674164 Got an hour and a half for makeup and hair.
6674189 6676341 Then we gotta get you in the fitting room,<br />get you your dress.
6676365 6678947 After that, we'll have one final test<br />on stage for lighting and sound.
6678972 6680633 Then we have a bit of downtime<br />before the show starts.
6680658 6681445 You got it?
6681711 6682964 You good?<br />Okay, let's go.
6691000 6692000 The dress!
6692403 6693403 Wonderful!
6694354 6695340 Perfect!
6703462 6705155 There you go...
6712380 6713380 It's good.
6714042 6715258 Can we get the dance lights?
