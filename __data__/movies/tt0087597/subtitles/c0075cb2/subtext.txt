174488 175478 Good morning.
175555 177455 It's 8:00 in wonderful<br />Coombs County,
177524 180755 where once again state police have refused<br />to confirm or deny
180827 184354 more of those mysterious lights in the sky<br />sightings by local residents.
184431 186832 Roving air reporters spoke<br />with Miss Josie Floss,
186900 188299 who made just<br />such a sighting.
188368 190928 I've seen those<br />lights with my own eyes.
191004 194304 And when I called the police,<br />they told me it was swamp gas.
196109 199272 Bullshit! Ain't no swamps<br />in Coombs County!
199346 201405 I tell you,<br />with them illegal aliens...
201481 203950 Gonna be a sparkling day.
204918 206317 Sparkling.
206420 210379 Makes me crazy! Clara!
211258 212783 Clara!
212859 215123 My electric's gone<br />out again, Clara!
215195 216663 I'm gonna miss my soaps!
216730 217754 Oh, stop your yakking.
217831 218889 Bill?
218965 221400 Bill, Elvira's<br />blacked out again.
221468 222663 Pass the word.
222736 223862 Have a nice day, honey.
223937 225405 Okay, thanks, Mrs. Boone.<br />You too.
226206 228265 Elvira's got no electric.
228342 231573 She can't see her soaps,<br />she'll hyperventilate.
231645 232976 Great day for a picnic,<br />Maggie!
233046 235037 Can't wait, Mr. Boone.<br />Catch yourself a big one!
235115 236105 If I can!
236183 238880 Granny, I fixed your lunch<br />and put it in the fridge.
238952 240010 Have fun, child.
240087 241179 Sure you're<br />gonna be okay?
241254 242244 I'll be fine, dear.
242322 244518 Now you just run along. Bye!
249730 250856 Hi, Mrs. Rogan.
250931 251989 Hi, Maggie.
252065 254261 Did you find that<br />picnic basket yet?
254334 255324 It's in the living room.
255402 257370 Oh, thanks.<br />Where's Alex?
257437 258734 Where else?
258805 260034 Right.
261341 262638 Louis.
265846 267177 Good morning,<br />space-son Louis.
267247 268510 Earthling.
268582 269913 Louis!
270050 271381 Jane!
271952 274353 Elvira's electric<br />is out again,
274421 277755 and she's gonna get hyper<br />if she can't see her soaps!
278825 281385 Granny, tell Elvira<br />that Alex will be over
281461 283953 to patch her electric<br />in time for the soaps.
284030 286397 I'll tell her, Jane.<br />Elvira!
286466 287934 - Louis!<br />- Elvira!
288001 289526 Louis!
289603 291071 Go tell Alex that I need him.
291138 292572 Beware, aliens.

412492 416451 go to the drive-in, get drunk<br />and throw up every Saturday night,

422035 424527 - Mr. Serioso.<br />- Alex!
424604 426038 Yeah?
426106 428268 Honey, Elvira's<br />electric is out.
429543 431534 Oh, Ma, that's gonna<br />take all day.
431611 433511 I was going to Silver Lake.
433580 437107 Honey, I know. I'm sorry.<br />I'm working lunch and dinner.
437183 439413 I'm gonna be<br />in town all day!
441655 444181 Oh, all right.<br />Okay, Ma. I'll do it.
444758 446283 Thanks, honey.
448528 450292 We're gonna be late.
453233 454632 Look. You...
454768 456167 You'd just better<br />go ahead without me.
456236 457726 No. Alex, I'll stay.
457804 459829 No. That's okay.<br />This'll take a while.
459973 461998 I'll catch up with you later.
462943 464104 Alex...
471384 472715 Bye-bye, Rogan!
472786 474083 See you, dude!
478158 480525 Alex, come help me!
482062 484895 Hey, Alex.<br />Could you give me a hand here?
488802 490531 Thanks, Alex!
510390 512415 What should<br />we do tonight?
513093 515027 I don't know.
515161 517095 How about cards?
517163 518995 Hey, that's a good idea.
519132 520964 But we played<br />cards last night.
522068 523297 Well...
524471 527372 The missus wants to go into town<br />tonight and go dancing.
558371 561705 The fish were really biting<br />down there at the stream.
562475 565206 It was pleasant<br />fishing today.
565945 568937 Yup. It's gonna be<br />pleasant tomorrow too.
570550 574145 Gonna be a pleasant summer<br />according to Farmer's Almanac.
574487 576478 Yeah. I love<br />the Farmer's Almanac.
576623 578614 I've been reading it<br />for years.
580727 582320 Greetings, Starfighter.
582395 584625 You have been recruited<br />by the Star League
584998 588332 to defend the Frontier against<br />Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada.
588535 590128 Yeah. Yeah.
590203 592604 Get ready.<br />Prepare for blastoff.
598378 601473 Prepare for target<br />light practice, Starfighter.
611191 612420 Oh, hi, Alex.
612492 613687 Hey, Otis.
617797 619595 Where's your Maggie?
621000 622525 Good question.
622602 624092 Out having a good time,<br />I guess.
624971 628271 And you never<br />have a good time.
628341 629638 Is that it?
629709 632644 Oh, sure. I love patching<br />30-year-old fuse panels
632712 634942 and plunging<br />people's toilets.
635715 637046 Otis, I never even<br />get a chance
637117 638676 to have a good<br />time around here.
640420 643947 Things change. Always do.
647327 649318 You'll get your chance.
649395 651625 Important thing is,<br />when it comes,
651698 655430 you got to grab it with both hands<br />and hold on tight.
659506 662669 Enemy squadrons in Sectors 3, 6, 7<br />closing fast.
672085 673177 Thanks, Jack.
673253 674277 You're welcome.
674354 675753 - Good night, Maggie.<br />- Good night.
709556 711547 Thought you were gonna<br />meet me at the lake.
711624 713092 What happened?
713660 715651 Same thing that always happens.<br />I couldn't get away.
719165 720724 Where's everybody else?
720867 722426 Oh, they went to a movie.
725171 728197 Old Jack Blake just happened<br />to be going your way, huh?
728274 730402 Enemy squadron in Sector 3.
732245 734270 He said it was<br />on his way home.
734347 736509 Blake lives on<br />the other side of town.
736783 738547 Come on, Alex.
739719 741881 I wanted to get back to you.
744524 745958 Okay?
751231 753791 Good show, Starfighter!<br />Way to go.
754968 756458 Alex, look!
757470 760269 Oh, my God.<br />What is that? 900,000!
765545 770312 900,000!<br />You gonna bust the record!
772418 777049 Hey! Hey! Listen up,<br />everybody!
777123 779717 Alex is going<br />for the record!
780860 782259 Record?
782395 783829 Take... Take a hand.
783897 786559 Got them!<br />Oh, he's gonna get that one!
790603 792093 You can do it!
793072 794267 Otis?
796843 799437 Otis, what are you yelling about?<br />What's wrong?
799512 801606 Come on! Come on!
801681 803547 He's going to<br />bust the record!
805184 806583 Hurry! Hurry!
806653 808883 Everyone get back!<br />Don't crowd him!
808955 810980 I said, get back!
819432 821730 Alex, you never<br />got this far before!
821801 823166 Go, Alex!
829008 830373 Good boy!
832312 834974 Ko-Dan command ship<br />entering kill zone.
835048 836174 Command ship!
836249 837444 Oh, command ship!
837517 839076 What's a command ship?
839152 841120 You can do it, Alex!<br />You can do it!
845525 848460 One more now. Come on!<br />That's the one!
848528 850792 That's the one we want!
859706 861606 Yeah! Yeah!
894307 896742 - Good night.<br />- Way to go, Alex!
896809 897833 Good night, kids.
897910 899400 Alex, you're something else.
899545 901035 You're wonderful, boy.
901114 902809 Thank you.
902949 904678 If I said it once,<br />I said it a thousand times.
904751 906276 That boy's gonna go places.
906352 907911 That's one smart boy.
922402 924029 Good night, Alex.
926439 928840 Good night, Alex?<br />Wait a second.
928908 931070 Maggie? Maggie?
932912 935506 Hold on a second.<br />Where are you going?
940286 941811 What's wrong?
943089 946184 Well, I guess<br />it just hit me.
946893 949328 You really are leaving<br />here, aren't you?
949395 951523 Of course, I'm leaving.<br />We're both gonna leave here.
951597 954066 - Both of us, Alex?<br />- Yeah.
954133 956397 We talked about this.
956469 957903 When I get to school,<br />I'm gonna find a place
957970 959369 and I'm gonna come<br />back and get you.
959439 960964 Well, what about Granny?
961908 963239 Granny?
965645 967579 Truth is, you're scared<br />of leaving this trailer park.
967647 970082 I'm not scared of leaving<br />this trailer park, Alex.
970149 972208 Hey. Listen.
974921 978516 Whatever happens,<br />it's you and me forever, right?
980226 981421 Right?
984063 986088 I love you so much, Alex.
986232 988257 I'll always love you, Maggs.
992405 994237 Diarrhea.
1009856 1013053 Maggie! Maggie!
1013759 1017491 Alex, I got to go in.<br />Good night.
1017563 1019497 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
1038751 1042312 Someday they're gonna say,<br />this is where it all began.
1042989 1044013 What?
1044090 1046388 Mom, I finally broke<br />the Starfighter record.
1046926 1049486 Oh, that's nice, dear.
1049629 1052189 Nice? It's stupendous!
1052265 1054529 Alex,
1054600 1057592 Mr. Brenner knew that you'd want<br />to see this as soon as possible,
1057670 1060298 so he brought it<br />by the diner and...
1060373 1062933 Well, I was so excited,<br />I opened it.
1063009 1064841 Oh, that's okay.<br />What is it?
1064911 1066709 It's about your loan.
1072385 1075844 You can still go to City College<br />with your friends.
1116662 1118596 Greetings, Starfighter.
1123169 1124193 Greetings, Starfighter.
1124270 1127103 You have been recruited<br />by the Star League to defend the Frontier.
1127173 1128334 You have been recruited...
1128407 1129533 Greetings, Starfighter.
1129609 1131008 You have been recruited...
1132178 1134169 You have been recruited...
1134547 1136572 You have been recruited...
1139051 1141383 Get ready.<br />Prepare for blastoff.
1185564 1187862 Hello. Excuse me, son.
1190136 1191729 Store's closed, mister.
1191804 1194466 I'm not here for cigarettes<br />or bubble gum, my boy.
1194540 1195871 Can you tell me<br />the name of the person
1195941 1197602 who broke the record<br />on that game over there?
1197677 1199611 Where I might find him?
1201147 1204117 Alex Rogan.<br />You're looking at him.
1204817 1207411 Alex Rogan.
1208187 1210281 - Who are you?<br />- Centauri's the name.
1210356 1212688 I invented Starfighter,<br />which is why I'm here.
1212758 1214123 - It is?<br />- It is.
1214193 1216753 We have to talk about a matter<br />of utmost importance.
1216829 1218524 Step into my office.
1218597 1220998 That's it. Come on now.
1221767 1223735 Nothing to be afraid of.
1228708 1231507 Oh, yes. Say hello<br />to my assistant, Beta.
1232411 1233674 Howdy.
1236849 1239978 I must congratulate you<br />on your virtuoso performance, my boy.
1240052 1241417 Centauri is impressed.
1241554 1242953 I've seen them come<br />and I've seen them go.
1243022 1245150 But you're the best, my boy.<br />Dazzling.
1245224 1247215 Light years ahead<br />of the competition.
1247360 1249385 Which is why<br />Centauri is here.
1250096 1252064 He's got a little<br />proposition for you.
1253099 1254328 Are you interested?
1255668 1256999 I guess.
1258804 1259999 Hey!
1266445 1267571 What are you doing?
1267646 1268704 Listen.
1268781 1270545 Centauri wants to<br />keep it for a surprise.
1270616 1274246 Trust me. Oh, you're<br />gonna love it. Love it!
1280559 1283927 The amusing thing about this,<br />it's all a big mistake.
1283996 1285589 That particular<br />Starfighter game
1285664 1287598 was supposed to be<br />delivered to Vegas,
1287666 1289566 not some flea-speck<br />trailer park
1289635 1291626 in the middle of tumbleweeds<br />and tarantulas.
1291704 1294696 So, it must be fate,<br />destiny, blind chance,
1294774 1296538 luck, even,<br />that brings us together.
1297309 1300404 And as the poet says,<br />the rest is history.
1310723 1313090 Where are you going?<br />Where are you taking me?
1313159 1316026 I told you. I wanna<br />save it for a surprise.
1316095 1320931 Hey. Are you the kind of kid<br />who reads the last page of a mystery first?
1321000 1323401 Who pesters the magician<br />to tell you his tricks?
1323469 1326063 Who sneaks downstairs to peek<br />at his Christmas presents?
1326138 1328402 No. Of course you're not!
1328474 1331273 That's why<br />I'm not gonna tell you.
1332611 1333601 Oh, God.
1335414 1338714 Besides, I just love<br />surprises, don't you?
1339785 1341310 Hey, look out!
1341687 1342711 - Stop!<br />- Oh, dear!
1342788 1344552 Hit the brakes! Hey...
1403816 1406217 Shifting into star drive<br />at Columba Zeta.
1406285 1407980 Hold tight.
1528040 1531340 Hey.<br />Hey, let me out of here!
1573185 1575745 There's a perfectly<br />logical explanation for all this.
1593772 1595706 Hey! Wait!<br />Where you going?
1610489 1613652 Hi! How are you?<br />What is this?
1614593 1616925 Listen. Do you speak<br />English? I'd...
1617563 1619122 This is nice but...
1632511 1634206 Centauri,<br />what's going on here?
1634279 1636475 He's just saying how delighted<br />he is that you're here.
1636548 1637674 And if there's<br />anything he can do
1637750 1639684 to make your stay more enjoyable,<br />just give him a ring.
1639752 1643052 My stay? What are you talking about?<br />Where are we?
1643122 1645147 Welcome to Rylos, my boy!
1646258 1647419 Rylos?
1648060 1650392 Wait a minute. You mean...<br />You mean like in a game?
1650462 1652430 Oh, he's quick.<br />He's quick. He's very quick.
1652498 1655627 He's speechless.<br />So long, Alex! Have fun!
1655701 1659035 May the luck of the Seven Pillars of Gulu<br />be with you at all times.
1659104 1662631 Oh, someday these cheapskates<br />will thank Centauri. Trust me.
1667412 1669312 Where the hell is June?
1674553 1676783 Yolanda, baby!
1687533 1688864 Hi, Maggs.
1689868 1691233 Hi, Louis.
1692070 1693196 Is he up?
1693272 1697300 Yeah. He's been up<br />all night moaning.
1702147 1703478 Alex?
1707519 1710011 Your mother told me<br />about the loan.
1710589 1712648 Is there anything I can do?
1719298 1722666 Listen. I'll be next door<br />if you need anything, okay?
1799478 1800604 Gunstars.
1802714 1804512 I got to be dreaming.
1809421 1810445 Yeah, right.
1818363 1820730 Listen, there's been<br />a big mistake.
1820799 1822699 Immediately after situation report.
1822768 1823860 Navigation...
1823936 1826303 Welcome to<br />Starfighter Command.
1826371 1827429 You speak English?
1827506 1830237 No. You hear English,<br />thanks to your translator device.
1830309 1831902 Hurry up.<br />We haven't got much time.
1831977 1834002 The briefing<br />begins immediately.
1834546 1836207 Join the other recruits.
1836281 1838079 Wait a minute!<br />Wait a minute!
1838317 1840217 Wait a minute!<br />What are you talking about, recruits?
1843522 1845286 I don't believe this.
1848427 1852660 Attention. Attention, please.<br />Ambassador Enduran has arrived
1852731 1856031 and will now address<br />Starfighter Command personnel.
1858971 1862874 As you all know, we have been<br />on a desperate quest...
1862941 1864705 Excuse me. Excuse me.
1864776 1865902 To find<br />Starfighters and navigators.
1869881 1873408 I should... I should<br />crush you to gorun dust!
1874186 1876985 I'm sorry...<br />It was an accident.
1877055 1878580 I didn't mean to<br />step on your...
1879391 1880756 Whatever that is.
1880826 1881918 Hideous creature.
1881994 1883484 If I may continue.
1884429 1885954 Our forces have...
1886031 1887521 You don't trifle<br />with a Bogati.
1887599 1889033 They love to fight.
1889101 1891297 That's why they're<br />perfect for this war.
1893271 1894295 Did you say war?
1894373 1895397 But of course!
1895474 1897704 Why else do you<br />think you're here?
1897776 1899801 You were recruited<br />by the Star League to defend...
1899878 1903644 To defend the Frontier against<br />Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada.
1906018 1911479 Eons ago, our ancestors created<br />our great Frontier,
1911556 1913820 a barrier of energy
1913892 1917055 encircling the peaceful<br />systems of the universe,
1917763 1921961 and forever shutting out<br />the scourge that lurks beyond.
1924202 1928764 Fellow Rylans,<br />because of a dark betrayal,
1928840 1930774 our Frontier<br />will soon collapse.
1933512 1938643 So we turn to you,<br />Starfighters and your navigators.
1938717 1942347 For of all the billions of creatures<br />in the Star League,
1942421 1945914 only you few were<br />found to possess the
1948060 1949186 gift.
1950729 1953824 You, and you alone,
1953899 1957631 stand between us<br />and the black terror of the Ko-Dan.
1959938 1961633 Victory or death!
1961773 1963468 Victory or death!
1963542 1966568 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1966645 1969478 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1969548 1972381 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1972451 1975113 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1975187 1977986 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1978056 1980991 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1981059 1984222 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1984696 1987757 Now, Starfighters, if you will<br />reach underneath your seats,
1987833 1991292 you will find a packet<br />which contains one hand...
1995173 1998143 This is a restricted area,<br />off-limits to...
2000979 2003949 My apologies, Starfighter.
2004015 2007383 Star Navigator First Class Grig<br />at your service, sir!
2009988 2013390 Hi. I'm Alex Rogan.<br />I was playing this game back home,
2013458 2014584 and this guy<br />came up to me.
2014659 2016525 Only he's not a guy.<br />He's an alien, right?
2016595 2019326 And I get into his car.<br />Only it's not a car. It's a spaceship.
2019397 2022833 And, there's been<br />a big mistake.
2022901 2024801 Am I to understand<br />you're actually declining
2024870 2027168 the honor of becoming<br />a Starfighter?
2027239 2028570 You got it.
2028640 2030005 Extraordinary!
2031009 2034775 For eons, all creatures have dreamt<br />of being Starfighters.
2035313 2037281 - Where you from?<br />- Earth.
2037349 2040546 And we're not at war with anybody,<br />except each other.
2040619 2044317 Earth? Earth isn't a formal member<br />of the Star League,
2044389 2046687 and isn't due to be approached<br />until it matures.
2046758 2049625 This is all<br />highly irregular.
2049694 2052026 Tell me.<br />Who recruited you?
2052097 2053326 Centauri.
2054065 2055123 There he is.<br />That's him!
2055200 2057635 Centauri.<br />I might have known.
2062274 2066006 Up to your old Excalibur<br />tricks again, eh, Centauri?
2066745 2068645 Did it ever occur to you<br />that it is against the law
2068713 2071341 to recruit from worlds<br />outside the Star League?
2071416 2073510 Earth's in danger too,<br />isn't it?
2073652 2075746 And, no, I did not<br />use the Excalibur test.
2075820 2077447 It was called<br />a video game.
2077522 2079081 What's all the brouhaha?
2079157 2081956 After all,<br />he does have the gift!
2082027 2084428 This may come as<br />a bit of a shock to you,
2084496 2086828 but he doesn't want<br />to be a Starfighter.
2087566 2090695 Doesn't want to be a...<br />Are you a coward?
2090769 2091759 Are you crazy?
2091836 2093429 You didn't tell me<br />about any of this!
2094139 2096130 Return the money, Centauri!
2096208 2099473 Return the money?<br />Are you delirious?
2099544 2101535 Do you know how long<br />it took to invent the games,
2101613 2102739 to merchandise them,
2102814 2105613 to get them into<br />the stores by Christmas?
2106151 2108142 It must be terribly<br />embarrassing for you,
2108220 2110154 and I do sympathize.<br />However...
2110222 2111712 But I saw him fight!
2111790 2113554 He could be the greatest<br />Starfighter ever!
2113625 2115389 That was a game, Centauri.
2115460 2116518 A game?
2117696 2120722 You may have thought it was a game,<br />but it was also a test.
2120799 2122494 A test!
2122567 2127061 Sent out across the universe to find<br />those with the gift to be Starfighters.
2127138 2130073 And here you are, my boy.<br />Here you are!
2130141 2131836 Right! Here I am,<br />about to be killed!
2131910 2132934 Killed.
2134679 2138013 You don't seriously<br />think it's dangerous, do you?
2138083 2140518 Don't be silly! Trust me!
2158770 2159896 Xur!
2160705 2161729 Xur!
2163008 2164237 Xur?
2165810 2170873 Yes, Father, your mighty Frontier<br />grows weaker by the moment.
2171983 2174918 Do not call me father!
2175654 2178055 You are no longer my son!
2178123 2181423 You're an outcast!<br />Why have you returned?
2181860 2184795 I have returned for<br />the good of all Rylans.
2184863 2188265 With an armada of Ko-Dan warships<br />behind you?
2188333 2191894 There are some Rylans<br />who would welcome me, Father.
2191970 2195804 Star League justice<br />put down your Xurian cult.
2195874 2198241 Your followers are<br />few and scattered.
2198310 2200438 Star League?
2200512 2204005 A refuge for weak worlds<br />not worthy to be our equals!
2204082 2206551 That is for the Rylans<br />to decide,
2206618 2210577 and not for a dangerous<br />and evil child such as yourself.
2212290 2217057 And yet, it is this child<br />who caught your master spy.
2246624 2248285 Hear me, Rylans!
2250161 2255429 When the green moon of Galan is eclipsed,<br />Ko-Dan Armada will invade,
2257135 2261800 and not even your mighty Starfighters<br />will be able to save you.
2261873 2265309 We shall see, Xur.<br />We shall see!
2278256 2279849 You still want to go?
2279924 2281483 And miss all the excitement?
2287432 2288558 Little brat.
2288633 2290965 I invent the game,<br />find the kid, drag him up there,
2291035 2293470 and he doesn't want<br />to be a Starfighter.
2293538 2294972 I give up!
2331443 2335539 Control, do you copy our star angle<br />difference from parking angle?
2336714 2341311 Delta beta two at six,<br />delta gamma three at five.
2346891 2349883 Emperor Xur ordered me<br />to bring his scepter.
2351930 2353557 Let him enter.
2353631 2356100 Target vector<br />remains on scope.
2370782 2374241 Just like your Ko-Dan emperor's,<br />isn't it, Commander Kril?
2374319 2380554 It takes more than a scepter to rule,<br />Xur, even on Rylos.
2383294 2384989 You're right, Kril.
2386831 2389323 It does take<br />more than a scepter.
2398109 2400578 How long must we<br />endure this fool?
2402547 2404413 We have a break<br />in the Frontier.
2404482 2406246 Fire the meteor gun!
2407852 2412016 My dear Ko-Dan friends!<br />Lest we forget,
2412090 2415958 it was your own emperor<br />who granted me command of this Armada.
2416027 2418928 For only I hold<br />the secret to the Frontier.
2419697 2422359 Only I know the location<br />of the Starfighter base.
2422433 2426131 And therefore, only I will give<br />the order to fire!
2430441 2432273 Forgive me, Xur.
2438750 2441185 You are forgiven,<br />Commander Kil.
2444756 2448215 Meteor gunner... fire.
2481259 2482556 Sergeant!
2484996 2488728 I have an unidentified<br />incoming object in Sector 31, sir.
2492937 2495599 They're headed for<br />the base! Alert!
2495673 2496868 We are under attack!
2496941 2499308 I repeat,<br />we are under attack!
2500378 2502847 Activate automatic<br />repulser guns.
2556934 2560063 Condition Red! Condition Red!
2569113 2571013 At last, it is done!
2572583 2574813 Soon the Frontier<br />will be down
2574952 2577216 and they will bow<br />to their new emperor!
2578222 2579849 Or I will darken<br />the sky with their ashes.
2579924 2581824 Commander,<br />the Xurian spy reports
2581893 2583827 that one Starfighter<br />has escaped.
2584729 2586094 Escaped?
2599043 2600272 You sure I can't<br />give you a hand?
2600344 2602403 You've done quite enough<br />already. Thank you.
2602480 2603641 Well...
2605450 2607384 It's only a few more<br />miles from here. I guess...
2607452 2609443 I guess I can walk it.
2609520 2612717 So long!<br />Bye, Centauri!
2624936 2626700 Oh, Alex!
2628673 2629765 Here!
2634245 2636270 Hey, listen. I can't take<br />a present from you, Centauri.
2637582 2638879 He reduces me<br />to poverty again
2638950 2640543 and he thinks I'm<br />giving him a present.
2640618 2641847 What a world this is.
2641986 2643249 What is it, then?
2643321 2645255 It's a second chance,<br />my boy!
2645323 2648691 If you change your mind,<br />just tap the communo-crystals.
2653264 2655733 - Keep it.<br />- Alex, Alex!
2655800 2658735 You're walking away<br />from history. History!
2658803 2662296 Did Chris Columbus say<br />he wanted to stay home? No!
2662373 2665001 What if the Wright Brothers<br />thought that only birds should fly?
2665076 2668876 And did Geloca think the Yulus<br />were too ugly to save?
2668946 2670414 Who's Geloca?
2672283 2673648 Never mind.
2675286 2676583 Listen, Centauri.<br />I'm not any of those guys.
2676654 2678144 I'm a kid from<br />a trailer park.
2678222 2681852 If that's what you think,<br />then that's all you'll ever be!
2712590 2714024 Hey, Maggie!
2715827 2717761 Listen to this.<br />You're not going to believe this.
2718663 2719755 I told you, Alex.
2719831 2720889 Me and my...<br />How did you put it?
2720965 2724401 Strange sexual urges,<br />aren't talking to you anymore.
2765243 2766301 Who's there!
2766377 2768675 You're gonna wake up Louis.
2777521 2779353 Hey, you look like me!
2779490 2781322 Of course I do.<br />I'm the beta unit.
2782360 2784556 What the hell's<br />a beta unit?
2784862 2790926 A beta unit is a simuloid,<br />an exact duplicate of you, only not as loud.
2793537 2794800 I was in the starcar,<br />remember?
2794872 2796135 We shook hands?
2796207 2798608 I became you, unfortunately.
2800411 2802709 Let me get this straight.<br />You're a robot?
2802947 2804972 I beg your pardon.
2805683 2809415 I'm a state-of-the-art,<br />top-of-the-line beta unit,
2809487 2813151 put here as a courtesy replacement<br />for while you're away.
2813224 2815022 Lucky me.
2815092 2816958 Wait a minute.<br />What are you doing back?
2817028 2818723 Are you kidding?<br />It's war up there!
2818796 2821857 Save the whales<br />and not the universe, huh?
2822600 2824466 Well, why don't you<br />go up there and fight?
2824535 2827061 Simuloids can't fight.<br />We're not allowed.
2827138 2829539 Well, tell them that<br />you're me! Pretend!
2829674 2832109 Be quiet, Alex.
2832176 2833837 Sorry, Louis.
2834946 2836243 Thanks for the lift!
2836314 2837713 Sure thing, buddy.<br />See you around!
2860338 2862204 Greetings, Starfighter.
2862273 2864640 You have been recruited<br />by the Star League
2864709 2867007 to defend the Frontier<br />against Xur and...
2887832 2889322 And, hey,<br />what did you do to Maggie?
2889400 2890834 Do to her?
2890901 2892335 We're sitting outside,<br />looking at the stars,
2892403 2894428 and she sticks her<br />tongue in my ear.
2895172 2897971 I screamed. I'll apologize<br />tomorrow, okay?
2898042 2899476 You're not gonna be here.
2899543 2901272 You're going back<br />with Centauri right now!
2901679 2902703 What's up, Alex?
2902780 2905875 Back to sleep, Louis,<br />or I'm telling Ma about your Playboys.
2908219 2909448 You're blowing it, Alex!
2914658 2916319 What the shit?
2916394 2919625 I said, back to sleep, Louis,<br />or I'm telling Ma about your Playboys!
2921732 2923427 Come in, Centauri.
2924435 2925425 Come on. Get back here.
2925503 2927267 And take your<br />Tonka toy with you.
2928139 2929903 Greetings, Starfighter.
2929974 2933274 You have been recruited by<br />the Star League to defend the Frontier
2933344 2936075 against Xur and<br />the Ko-Dan Armada.
2936981 2938676 Greetings, Starfighter.
2938749 2940148 You have been<br />recruited by the Star League
2940217 2942618 to defend the Frontier<br />against Xur...
2947358 2949918 Where are you?<br />Come on, where are you?
2949994 2951325 Centauri?
2952296 2954196 Greetings, Starfighter!
2955399 2956696 Centauri?
3018829 3020297 Oh, shit!
3020364 3022128 Come on, Alex.<br />Don't be such a wimp!
3039917 3041043 Centauri, look out!
3041118 3042279 What the...
3070381 3073180 Foul stench.<br />Dirty creatures.
3077755 3079382 Get a good look, Alex.
3079456 3082619 You can bet your asteroids<br />you'll be seeing more of them.
3082693 3083888 What?
3083961 3085395 This is a Zando-Zan.
3085763 3088755 An interstellar hitbeast,<br />compliments of Xur.
3089500 3091901 Xur? Why is he after me?
3091969 3094233 Somehow he found out<br />you're a Starfighter.
3094305 3097935 So you see, Alex, you got to go back.<br />You got no choice.
3098008 3099908 'Cause if you stay down here,<br />you're dog food.
3099977 3101638 Trust Centauri, my boy.
3101712 3105910 Because in two hours, this place<br />will be crawling with 10 Zando-Zans
3105983 3109920 with just one thought<br />on their microscopic little minds.
3109987 3111580 Kill Alex Rogan.
3111655 3113214 Kill Alex Rogan.
3113290 3114724 He's right, Alex.
3114792 3117454 At least up there you'll have<br />a fighting chance in a Gunstar.
3117528 3118620 Exactly.
3118696 3121688 Meanwhile, down here,<br />they'll be going after Beta.
3121765 3123290 - Beta.<br />- Beta?
3123367 3125301 Of course.<br />What do you think he's here for?
3125369 3128168 Wait a...<br />Wait a second here, Centauri.
3128239 3129468 Alex, look out!
3137381 3138780 Centauri!
3140084 3141142 Beta, get a doctor!
3141218 3143653 No. No native cures.<br />No witch doctors.
3144088 3146386 I'm fine. Just a scratch.
3149360 3152819 Now face it, Alex.<br />You're a born Starfighter.
3155432 3157025 Are you with me?
3166710 3168701 Okay, let's go, Centauri.
3171048 3172607 Good luck, Alex.
3175653 3177451 You too, Alex.
3200644 3202976 Centauri to<br />Starfighter Command.
3203547 3205413 Centauri to<br />Starfighter Command.
3205482 3207041 Come in, please.
3223834 3225359 Hey, Centauri.
3228439 3230237 Attention all personnel.
3230307 3232469 Starcar is approaching<br />Docking Bay 12.
3233877 3236175 Centauri! Centauri!
3241318 3243116 Hey, hit the brakes!
3248792 3250760 - Grig! Hey, Grig!<br />- Alex!
3250828 3252762 They got Centauri.<br />He's hurt!
3252830 3254491 He's right over here.
3266210 3268269 Ah, you see?
3269713 3271203 Centauri brought him back!
3271281 3273113 Yes, I see. Don't talk.
3273984 3275952 Does he have my money, Alex?
3276019 3278647 I have a fortune<br />for you, Centauri.
3278956 3280515 Now, please be still.
3281992 3285121 It's here. It's all here.<br />Piles and piles of it.
3286230 3287664 All for you.
3291068 3292331 At last.
3294772 3300302 Alex, I want you know, it was<br />for the greatest good I brought you back.
3302913 3306281 Of course, it...
3306950 3309248 It never hurts to be rich.
3319196 3323258 Until the next dimension,<br />old friend.
3325803 3327498 I'm sorry, Alex.
3328205 3329502 Centauri?
3335212 3336543 Centauri?
3338248 3341115 The Frontier could<br />collapse at any moment.
3341919 3343353 Alex!
3399943 3403607 Now I need an ear job.<br />Dying here. Dying.
3418562 3422226 Alex, what the hell's<br />going on?
3422299 3425496 Louis, you're having<br />a terrible nightmare.
3426303 3427429 Go back to sleep.
3432109 3433474 Louis!
3447157 3448647 Oh, no.
3458835 3462328 Am I to understand there's a beta unit<br />taking your place back home?
3462406 3463430 He's trying.
3463507 3466602 So it's safe to assume<br />that Xur thinks you're still on Earth.
3466677 3468475 Yeah.
3468545 3471276 That could work to our advantage,<br />theoretically.
3478288 3480655 Now you look human!
3483193 3484627 Is this my Gunstar?
3484695 3487164 This is a prototype,<br />different from the other ships.
3487230 3489028 She has a greater range,<br />more power,
3489099 3491227 and a slight<br />weapons modification.
3492436 3494131 And, of course,<br />she's got deflective plating,
3494204 3496639 so she can withstand<br />several direct hits.
3502012 3504208 From here, this is<br />where I navigate the ship,
3504281 3507273 maintain life support<br />and propulsion systems.
3508685 3509948 Okay. Where do I sit?
3510020 3512546 Way up there,<br />in the gunnery chair.
3515792 3517021 Hang on!
3517094 3518118 Okay.
3523367 3526132 Now, climb into<br />the gunnery chair.
3527371 3531035 Now, I'm moving you<br />into launch position.
3532542 3534374 There in front of you<br />are the two switches
3534444 3536742 for your heads-up display.<br />Turn them on.
3541251 3542446 While you're engaging<br />the enemy,
3542519 3546149 the screen will reflect<br />all battle instruments towards you.
3548091 3549081 Hey, where did it go?
3549159 3551753 It's still there,<br />suspended in a xenon mist.
3551828 3553762 But it's only visible<br />if you look dead ahead.
3553830 3555798 Got it.
3555966 3557934 The lever on your left<br />is the chair controller.
3558001 3561301 As you can see, all guns will track<br />with your every move.
3569012 3572141 Grasp the target control<br />with your right hand.
3572215 3575776 At your fingers is the weaponry,<br />the lasers, photon bolts...
3575852 3577013 Photon bolts and<br />the particle beams.
3577087 3578748 Wait a minute.<br />This is just like back home.
3579356 3580755 - What's this?<br />- Careful, careful.
3580824 3584124 That's Death Blossom,<br />a weapon of last resort.
3584194 3587357 Luckily, I was in here<br />working on it when the hangar went up.
3587431 3590492 Now, are you ready?<br />All systems, go!
3592602 3593899 Ignition!
3597874 3599740 When did the hangar go up?
3599810 3602745 I told you,<br />when Xur attacked.
3602913 3604108 And where were<br />the Starfighters?
3604181 3605307 In the hangar!
3605382 3607077 You mean they're dead?
3607150 3609209 Death is a primitive concept.
3610220 3615021 I prefer to think of them<br />as battling evil in another dimension.
3615092 3617789 In another dimension?<br />How many are left?
3617861 3619090 Including yourself?
3619563 3620792 Yeah.
3622065 3623328 One!
3624401 3625459 One?
3636747 3638044 Hold it.
3640884 3643683 There's no fleet,<br />no Starfighters, no plan?
3643754 3646121 - One ship, you, me, and that's it?<br />- Exactly!
3646189 3647315 Xur thinks<br />you're still on Earth.
3647390 3649518 Classic military strategy.<br />Surprise attack.
3649593 3650788 It'll be a slaughter!
3650861 3652260 That's the spirit.
3652329 3653763 No, my slaughter.
3653830 3655764 One ship against<br />the whole Armada?
3655832 3659200 Yes. One Gunstar<br />against the Armada.
3659269 3664105 I've always wanted to fight<br />a desperate battle against incredible odds.
3666843 3668072 Target lights, Alex.
3668145 3669271 Target lights?
3669346 3671075 Yes. You might want<br />to squeeze off
3671148 3672809 a few rounds while<br />you have the chance.
3672883 3674908 Just work the bugs<br />out of the system.
3674985 3677113 After all,<br />it is her maiden voyage.
3698575 3700737 Steady.<br />Don't fight the chair.
3700811 3702677 Take your time.<br />Watch your gun sights.
3702746 3704578 Lead your targets.
3704648 3706980 And above all, relax!
3707551 3710714 Terrific. I'm about to get killed<br />a million miles from nowhere
3710787 3713757 with a gung-ho iguana<br />who tells me, relax.
3716927 3718417 Interstellar!
3751261 3752456 Alex!
3753163 3754392 Sorry.
3757000 3759867 Okay, now, come on.<br />Ease it up.
3761771 3762966 Okay.
3764741 3767369 Oh, that's...<br />That's it. Easy.
3767911 3769709 Nice and easy. Yep.
3770447 3773781 A little bit more<br />and we'll get it in there, now.
3774985 3776146 Alex!
3777921 3780822 Sorry. Hi, Maggs.
3780891 3782086 Alex, are you all right?
3782158 3784422 Yeah. Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.
3785929 3788398 Come on. Try it again.
3789933 3791799 Did you smell anything?
3793470 3794528 Like what?
3794671 3795763 Like a Z...
3796873 3798204 Forget it.
3806182 3809914 I just wanted to say<br />I'm sorry for slapping you last night.
3811154 3813953 Oh, that's okay, Maggs.<br />I deserved it.
3814024 3815753 I'm sorry.
3815959 3820089 Well, maybe we can make it up to each other<br />tonight at Silver Lake?
3849326 3851795 The Armada will break<br />through the Frontier here,
3851861 3854296 and reach Rylos in 20 klicks.
3854364 3857129 Squadrons of deck fighters<br />will precede the mother ship.
3857200 3859032 Squadrons?<br />How many squadrons?
3859102 3861332 It isn't the number of squadrons<br />that concerns me.
3861404 3863270 It's this communication<br />turret that sends out
3863340 3864865 the commands to<br />the deck fighters,
3864941 3867171 which enables them to act as one<br />during the fight.
3867243 3869940 Wait a second. We knock out the turret<br />to get the fighters.
3870013 3872539 But to get the turret,<br />we have to get through the fighters.
3872615 3873980 We're dead.
3874050 3876917 I'll have it all figured out<br />by the time we reach the Frontier.
3880023 3881184 What's that?
3881257 3882315 The Frontier.
3891668 3893693 Now, that's strange.<br />What's a cargo ship
3893770 3895568 doing this close<br />to the Frontier?
3896473 3899170 Hail.<br />This is Gunstar One.
3903880 3905712 I repeat,<br />this is Gunstar One.
3905782 3907944 Identify yourself, please.
3910186 3911745 Alex, look out.
3914891 3916359 A Xurian ship!
3919029 3920190 Congratulations, Alex.
3920263 3922960 This is your<br />first live target.
3923166 3924361 Live?
3928071 3930870 Within range in five klicks.<br />Get ready!
3935678 3937339 I've blocked its<br />beam of frequency,
3937414 3939382 so it can't report<br />back to the Armada.
3940884 3942648 - Fire when ready!<br />- Grig, wait!
3952529 3955294 We mustn't lose them<br />in these caves, Alex! Fire!
3978588 3980022 Shoot, Alex!
3984627 3987494 Shoot!
3995138 3996299 You did it!
4003346 4005906 I did it? You did it!
4005982 4007347 You almost got me killed!
4010487 4012649 My deepest apologies, Alex.
4013423 4015790 I had hoped that by putting you<br />in the thick of battle,
4015859 4018294 a great Starfighter<br />would emerge.
4018461 4023729 But, alas. Perhaps there was never one<br />within you to begin with.
4026336 4028168 I shall take you home.
4029472 4032931 You still may live a long<br />and fruitful life back there.
4033710 4037044 That is, until the<br />Ko-Dan reach Earth.
4038381 4039371 But then again...
4054497 4057626 Hey, yo, Blake!<br />Make that sucker blast, man!
4057700 4060397 You got it, dude!<br />All right!
4066543 4069171 So Blake comes back in<br />to grab his pants, right?
4069245 4071009 Sees her old lady,<br />and says,
4071080 4074141 I hope this doesn't rule out<br />dinner on Tuesday night.
4075952 4077477 That's my man!
4081324 4083850 Alex, are you okay?
4085094 4087290 Yeah, sure. Why?
4088398 4091493 I don't know. You're<br />just acting spaced out.
4091568 4093036 You're...<br />You're not yourself.
4095004 4100101 Well, if you were me,<br />what would you be doing right now?
4103813 4107249 Well, for one thing,<br />I'd be trying to enjoy myself.
4107317 4111254 Leaning back.<br />Kidding around. Laughing.
4111321 4112516 Laughing?
4112589 4113954 Well, it's a start, Alex.
4114857 4116188 Laughing.
4161437 4164338 Nice place.<br />Reminds me of home.
4164407 4166205 This reminds you of home?
4166276 4167971 Oh, yes.
4173116 4179715 I live below ground with my wifeoid<br />and 6,000 little Griglings.
4187497 4190728 At least, until Xur<br />turns them into slaves.
4196039 4198303 Where does your kind live?
4198441 4200739 Oh, houses, mostly.
4201477 4205107 That's caves above ground.<br />See, here.
4205715 4208446 Here's my family.
4209052 4210542 See, that's...
4211154 4215216 That's my folks and my brother, Louis,<br />and that's Maggie.
4217427 4219555 We live in a mobile home.
4221331 4223732 That's a cave<br />that goes places.
4224033 4226195 Only we never went anyplace.
4228838 4232968 A mobile cave that never went anywhere.<br />Fascinating.
4233042 4236444 Yeah, but we have below-ground caves<br />near the trailer parks.
4236512 4239914 Me and my brother, Louis,<br />used to play hide-and-seek in them.
4242051 4244042 Hide-and-seek.
4244120 4245110 What is it, Alex?
4245188 4248818 Well, I was just thinking,<br />maybe we could hide here,
4248891 4253226 let the Armada pass by,<br />and then hit the turret from behind.
4253296 4255856 Then we might take<br />them by surprise.
4261037 4263267 Your plan might<br />really have worked.
4263339 4267242 What a pity there are no Starfighters<br />left to carry it out.
4267310 4268641 Yeah. Yeah.
4277687 4279246 A Xurian base!
4297740 4300368 Two more dead ahead!<br />Closing fast!
4324801 4327896 Earth course is logged<br />into navigational beams.
4329672 4330764 Grig?
4332575 4334168 What is it, Alex?
4339081 4341550 Maybe there is<br />a Starfighter left.
4389565 4390828 What's wrong?
4390900 4392493 Should I put my tongue<br />in your ear now?
4392969 4394664 Don't bother, Alex.
4395271 4396363 Well, it's just...
4396439 4398134 I'm kind of new at<br />these gland games.
4399775 4401743 What are you talking about?
4401811 4404746 It's like you're<br />a million miles away, Alex!
4414457 4417017 Wait. Darling.
4418127 4420357 Darling, forgive me.
4429505 4431337 Darling, forgive me.
4435578 4436909 Come on!
4437980 4440278 You're my Juliet. My Venus.
4444453 4448447 You're my Juliet. My Venus.
4451627 4453095 Alex!
4453162 4455130 All the other girls<br />meant nothing to me.
4455765 4458894 It was you, you, you.
4458968 4461130 Shut up and<br />talk dirty to me.
4463005 4468171 The other girls meant nothing to me.<br />It was you, you...
4470012 4471673 Should I talk<br />dirty to you now?
4472848 4474179 That does it.
4474250 4477220 Oh, God.<br />All right. I give up.
4477853 4479321 I'm not Alex Rogan.
4479388 4480856 What?
4480957 4482083 I'm a beta unit.
4482158 4483421 I'm an exact<br />duplicate of Alex.
4483693 4484854 He's up there<br />saving the universe,
4484927 4486725 while I'm down here<br />for target practice.
4489465 4490694 See?
4499542 4501476 Alex! Or whatever you are.<br />Wait. Wait.
4501544 4502568 What are you do...<br />Let me go.
4502645 4503635 If that Zando-Zan<br />reports back
4503713 4505841 that I'm not Alex,<br />Alex is in big trouble!
4505915 4507178 - You're staying here.<br />- No, I'm not.
4507249 4509843 I'm not staying anywhere<br />until I find out what's going on!
4512288 4515087 Hey, my truck!<br />Hey, hey, come back!
4517426 4519690 Scratch that paint,<br />and you're dead, Rogan!
4529972 4531440 Ready to invade, Commander.
4531507 4532531 Invade.
4532608 4535703 Commander, the Xurian ships<br />have not answered our invasion code.
4535778 4538145 The Frontier is down,<br />the moon is eclipsed,
4538214 4540546 the Starfighters are dead.<br />Invade!
4541484 4545352 All squadrons ahead,<br />half speed, with energy probes on.
4575985 4578818 Energy probe.<br />Shut down, Alex. Shut down.
4580056 4581387 Power off.
4598107 4600337 Alex? In space?
4603012 4605572 - Is this for real?<br />- Yes! That's what I'm trying to tell you!
4605648 4606877 It's all for real!
4606949 4608542 Well, then, don't talk.<br />Drive!
4621797 4624926 Commander Kril, we're getting a signal<br />on the alert frequency.
4625000 4626399 Acknowledge.
4629905 4631430 There it is. All right.
4631507 4633407 Now, when I give the signal,<br />we're gonna jump! Okay?
4633476 4635342 - What do you mean, jump?<br />- We're gonna ram him.
4635411 4636401 What?
4637513 4640141 Extermination Emissary<br />Zeta 6, one message.
4640216 4642116 Ready? Jump!
4642184 4643549 Alex!
4645221 4647155 The last Starfighter...
4649125 4651025 You owe me one, Alex.
4657366 4658527 Alex!
4661237 4663501 Transmission pulsars<br />have stopped, Commander.
4663572 4665404 The last Starfighter...
4665474 4667135 Is dead!
4668244 4670542 The last Starfighter is dead!
4671480 4674142 Nothing can stop us now.<br />Ahead full.
4674216 4676150 To Rylos!
4696272 4697762 The command ship!
4702578 4705047 There!<br />The turret at the far end!
4706816 4708045 I see it.
4711220 4712619 Good luck, Starfighter.
4713322 4715620 Thanks, Grig.<br />For everything.
4729238 4731104 I love you, Alex Rogan.

4748791 4750316 Let's do it.
4761237 4762796 Tracking alert.
4765908 4768434 Unidentified craft.<br />What is it?
4773315 4774749 Wait.
4774884 4776352 Gunstar!
4776819 4781052 So, the last Starfighter<br />is dead?
4782191 4785627 This has gone far enough.<br />Seize him!
4786428 4790023 How dare you?<br />I am the Emperor of Rylos!
4790099 4793000 I and I alone<br />command this entire op...
4793102 4795662 Release me! I command you!
4795738 4798503 You will pay for this<br />with your lives!
4799575 4801907 All guns fire!
4811086 4812986 There it is, the turret!
4813522 4814990 Alex, now!
4817126 4818150 Yeah!
4818227 4819251 Got it!
4820863 4822024 Hurry, Alex! Fire!
4822097 4823587 The Armada's almost to Rylos!
4843852 4846287 Escape pod activated.
4847957 4849789 Escape pod ignition.
4850726 4852592 The Gunstar is gone<br />from our sensors.
4852661 4854459 Alert wing commanders.
4855130 4857360 Communication turret<br />is destroyed.
4862504 4866031 All communication radar systems are out,<br />Wing Commander.
4866608 4869236 Proceed with<br />a visual attack formation.
4873048 4876985 Life support good.<br />Ammo packs at peak.
4877052 4878781 I think we've got<br />to use Death Blossom.
4878854 4880447 Remember,<br />Death Blossom delivers
4880522 4882752 only one massive volley<br />at close range.
4883525 4884959 Theoretically.
4885027 4886426 What do you mean,<br />theoretically?
4886495 4888589 After all,<br />D.B. has never been tested.
4888664 4891326 It might overload the systems.<br />Blow up the ship.
4891400 4892492 What are you worried about,<br />Grig?
4892568 4894297 Theoretically,<br />we should already be dead.
4896505 4899236 Open Death Blossom petals.<br />Switch is on.
4913789 4916417 Do not trigger D.B.<br />until we're within range.
4916558 4919186 Just use your lasers<br />until I give the signal.
4919261 4920319 Remember to lead...
4920396 4921830 I've been recruited<br />by the Star League
4921897 4923592 to defend the Frontier.
4923665 4924689 Now, are you ready?
4924767 4927395 This is it. Here we go.
4927536 4929231 Charge!
4958667 4960157 On your right!
4961737 4963205 Your left!
4964373 4965738 Evade!
4969578 4972013 Power packs are low!<br />We need time to recharge!
4974316 4976148 Laser power draining!
4984660 4987857 Grig, my weapons are gone!<br />Should I do it?
4987930 4988920 Easy, easy.
4988997 4990829 Wait till they're all<br />in Death Blossom range!
5000542 5001907 Fire!
5035277 5037336 We did it.
5037479 5039573 Yes, we actually did,<br />didn't we?
5043352 5045047 The command ship!
5045420 5046854 Commander, our guns are out.
5046922 5048583 Damage control<br />is repairing them.
5048657 5052116 Forget the guns!<br />Ramming speed!
5060936 5061994 Grig, we need power!
5062070 5063902 Death Blossom's<br />drained all power.
5064139 5067837 I'm working on it.<br />I'm trying to run boost.
5071313 5074112 All we have left is<br />life support power!
5080789 5082086 Grig!
5088297 5089628 All right!
5097239 5100971 Weapons on! We have them now!<br />Fire. Fire!
5123932 5125058 Damage report!
5126301 5129794 Guidance system out.<br />Auxiliary steering out.
5129871 5131305 Divert!
5132274 5133639 Divert!
5133709 5135143 She won't answer the helm!
5135210 5137577 We're locked into the moon's<br />gravitational pull!
5137646 5139171 What do we do?
5143018 5144110 We die.
5165641 5169100 On behalf of the Star League<br />and all citizens of Rylos,
5169177 5172374 I congratulate you on<br />your dazzling victory.
5172447 5174040 - Thank you.<br />- Thanks.
5174116 5177484 But as you know,<br />the Frontier is down,
5177552 5180021 Xur escaped,<br />and there is still danger.
5180088 5183217 So I was wondering<br />if you wouldn't be willing to stay on,
5183292 5185761 and rebuild<br />the Starfighter Legion.
5185827 5187352 Wait a minute.
5188163 5189756 Rebuild the Legion?
5189831 5191196 Yes.
5191533 5194935 Of course,<br />you'd have the help of an old friend.
5196104 5197833 An old friend? Who?
5214022 5216855 Centauri!<br />I thought you were dead!
5216925 5220418 Me die and miss all<br />the excitement? Oh, no.
5220495 5223055 I was merely dormant<br />while my body repaired itself.
5223131 5225099 Now, I won't bore<br />you with details.
5225167 5227966 Suffice it to say,<br />you're on Rylos, my boy.
5228036 5229435 Stop thinking human.
5229504 5231029 That's lesson number one.
5231106 5234542 Now, lesson number two,<br />you've got a good thing going here.
5234609 5237101 Keep smiling.<br />Don't blow it.
5237446 5241076 Lesson number three,<br />always trust Centauri.
5246088 5247954 Alex, they love you!
5252027 5255053 You see, all Rylos<br />is behind you.
5256431 5258024 You've got to stay, Alex!
5258100 5260068 You will stay, won't you?
5260135 5261569 Of course, he'll stay.
5262904 5265032 That's very reassuring,<br />Centauri.
5265107 5267599 Grig, I leave it in<br />your capable hands.
5269611 5271079 I'll stay.
5283759 5286854 Alex! Alex!
5300475 5301909 Greetings...
5303278 5304939 Greetings, Starfighter.
5305013 5306412 Bunny, have you<br />seen Alex?
5306481 5307812 Can't say that I have.
5307883 5311114 Well, ask Maggie.<br />She knows where he is.
5311186 5313120 She was with him.
5313188 5314587 Maggie, where's Alex?
5314656 5317250 Yeah, where's my truck?<br />Where's your boyfriend?
5317325 5319953 Mrs. Rogan, about Alex,<br />you see, he's...
5323231 5325598 - What is it? What's going on?<br />- I don't know.
5347722 5349315 Oh, my God!
5352327 5354625 All right!<br />We're being invaded!
5382090 5383387 Maggie.
5384493 5385824 Maggie.
5449057 5450183 Alex?
5450325 5451486 Hi, Maggs.
5452527 5453688 Alex,
5455764 5456788 is it you?
5456865 5459800 I mean, is it really you?
5464673 5465765 Look!
5467542 5468771 My God.
5469578 5470841 It is you.
5471446 5473915 It's Alex! Alex!
5473982 5475541 Alex, what is going on here?
5475617 5477085 What is this thing?
5485594 5487028 Is this your spaceship?
5487095 5488756 I don't know<br />what's gotten into him.
5488897 5490592 I don't understand that.
5490665 5492133 It's so strange!
5492200 5493634 Wait. Hold it.<br />Hold it, everybody.
5493702 5496728 Alex, what is all this?
5499207 5501266 I've been to<br />another planet, Ma.
5501343 5502435 Another planet?
5503612 5505740 Who was it helped<br />fix my antenna?
5505814 5506804 Yeah, who stole my truck?
5506881 5507871 And cut my electric?
5507949 5509974 And ruined my stove?
5510051 5512315 Oh, that was...<br />That was a beta unit.
5512387 5513445 Beta unit?
5513521 5514511 A robot.
5514589 5515920 Robot? What the...
5515991 5517220 Come on!
5517292 5518817 A monster!
5522864 5524332 A monster!
5524399 5526367 He got them chains on him.
5526501 5528492 All right! It's an alien!
5528570 5530095 Oh, no, wait!<br />Hey, hey!
5530171 5532196 Granny, put away that shotgun.<br />What's wrong with you?
5532273 5533672 This is my friend Grig.
5533742 5535107 I want you all to<br />meet my friend here.
5535176 5536166 You got to be kidding!
5536244 5538645 Grig, this is Mrs. Boone.
5540382 5541406 Hello.
5541483 5542541 Hello.
5542617 5543778 And this is Elvira.
5543852 5544910 Delighted.
5544986 5546351 Me too. How you doing?
5546421 5547616 I do well.
5547689 5548986 And this is Granny.
5549057 5550422 How do you do?
5550492 5552256 How do you do?
5552327 5553795 And this here's Otis.
5553862 5555261 A pleasure.
5555330 5557526 Any friend of Alex...
5558767 5560599 And this is Maggie.
5561770 5563738 A very large pleasure.
5564472 5565633 Hi.
5570011 5571877 You must be Louis!
5574649 5577141 I hear good things<br />about you.
5577218 5579482 Hear that, you slimes?<br />I'm famous.
5582257 5584624 And this is my mom.
5587629 5590428 You should be proud<br />of Alex, Mrs. Rogan.
5590965 5592228 You must all be<br />proud of him.
5592300 5596134 He saved the Star League<br />and hundreds of worlds, including Earth.
5596204 5598002 Oh, for heaven's sake!
5598139 5599971 Oh, my God!
5601776 5603835 Time to leave, Alex.
5603912 5605175 Alex?
5605680 5606841 I have to, Ma.
5606915 5608383 They need me up there.
5608450 5611215 Oh, Alex, I always knew<br />you'd leave someday,
5611286 5613118 but I never expected this.
5613188 5615384 Gee, can I go too, Alex?<br />Can I?
5615457 5618085 Sorry, squirt.<br />There's only enough room up there
5618159 5620821 for me, Grig, and Maggie.
5622497 5624158 - Me?<br />- Yeah.
5625734 5628032 Alex, I don't think I can...
5628103 5630595 What? Come here.<br />Come here.
5631406 5633170 Why else do you<br />think I came back?
5633241 5636233 - Well...<br />- Didn't we say we'd always be together?
5636311 5639838 Well, yeah, I mean,<br />together here or in the city.
5640348 5642043 But... But up there, Alex...
5642117 5643585 Maggs, you got to come.<br />You see, I'm not...
5643651 5645551 I don't know when<br />I'm gonna be back.
5646721 5648553 Don't you see? This is it.<br />This is our big chance.
5648623 5650921 It's like what Otis says,
5650992 5652619 when it comes,<br />you got to grab on
5652694 5654423 with both hands<br />and hold tight.
5657465 5659729 Well, what about<br />Granny, Alex?
5664873 5667638 You're right.<br />I'm scared of leaving here.
5668910 5670469 Why can't you just stay?
5670545 5674106 Maggie, I have to leave,<br />and I want you to come with me.
5678052 5680919 Alex! Hurry!
5684025 5685686 Well, I got to go.
5690398 5691559 Bye.
5695336 5697862 Alex, we can't hold off<br />their radar any longer.
5697939 5700067 Yeah, okay.<br />I got to go, Ma.
5700642 5701973 - Bye. Take it easy.<br />- Bye, darling.
5702043 5703511 So long. So long, everybody.
5703578 5704704 Bye, Alex!
5704779 5706042 Bye!
5706114 5709516 Bye, Alex. Bye, Alex!
5719427 5720588 Alex!
5721996 5723293 Granny...
5724532 5727968 Be sure and write,<br />or whatever it is they do up there.
5733141 5735303 Alex! Wait, Alex!
5753695 5754958 Get back! Come on!
5755029 5756258 Bye!
5756331 5757890 - Keep your distance!<br />- Watch what you're doing.
5757966 5759832 Keep your distance, now.
5759901 5762097 This baby really<br />packs a punch!
5763271 5764568 Bye.
5765139 5766163 Bye.
5766241 5768642 Look at him! Bye!
5768843 5770140 Bye.
5773114 5777745 Oh, go on. They're gonna be happy<br />up there! So long, Alex!
5779654 5781315 So long, Alex!
5784659 5786093 We're gonna be famous,<br />aren't we, Otis?
5786160 5787389 Yes, sir!
5787462 5791228 The whole world, the whole universe<br />is gonna know about it!
5791299 5792994 Starlite, Starbrite,
5793067 5796662 the place where Alex and<br />Maggie left for the stars!
5796738 5799036 Louis! Louis!
5799107 5800700 Greetings, Starfighter.
5800775 5802607 You have been recruited<br />by the Star League
5802677 5806204 to defend the Frontier against<br />Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada.
