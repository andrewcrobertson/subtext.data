173340 174340 MAN ON RADIO: Good morning.
174420 176300 It's 8:00 in wonderful<br />Coombs County,
176380 179590 where once again state police<br />have refused to confirm or deny
179680 183180 more of those mysterious "lights in<br />the sky" sightings by local residents.
183260 185680 Roving air reporters spoke<br />with Miss Josie Floss,
185770 187140 who made just<br />such a sighting.
187220 189770 JOSIE: I've seen those<br />lights with my own eyes.
189850 193150 And when I called the police,<br />they told me it was swamp gas.
194940 198110 Bullshit! Ain't no swamps<br />in Coombs County!
198190 200240 I tell you,<br />with them illegal aliens...
200320 202780 Gonna be a sparkling day.
203780 205160 Sparkling.
205280 209250 ELVIRA: [EXCLAIMING]<br />Makes me crazy! Clara!

215590 216590 Oh, stop your yakking.
216670 217710 CLARA: Bill?
217800 220220 Bill, Elvira's<br />blacked out again.

1190640 1193310 I'm not here for cigarettes<br />or bubble gum, my boy.
1193400 1194690 Can you tell me<br />the name of the person

1203660 1206280 Alex Rogan. Aha!
1207040 1209120 Who are you?<br />Centauri's the name.
1209200 1211540 I invented Starfighter,<br />which is why I'm here.
1211620 1212960 It is?<br />It is.
1213040 1215590 We have to talk about a<br />matter of utmost importance.
1215670 1217380 Step into my office.
1217460 1219840 That's it. Come on now.
1220630 1222590 Nothing to be afraid of.
1227560 1230350 Oh, yes. Say hello<br />to my assistant, Beta.
1231270 1232520 Howdy.
1234230 1235360 Ow!
1235690 1238820 I must congratulate you on your<br />virtuoso performance, my boy.

1244070 1246070 Light years ahead<br />of the competition.
1246200 1248240 Which is why<br />Centauri is here.
1248950 1250910 He's got a little<br />proposition for you.
1251960 1253160 Are you interested?
1254500 1255830 [CHUCKLES]<br />I guess.
1257670 1258840 [ENGINE SURGES]<br />Hey!

1266510 1267550 Listen.
1267640 1269390 Centauri wants to<br />keep it for a surprise.
1269470 1273140 Trust me. Oh, you're<br />gonna love it. Love it!
1277980 1279230 [CHUCKLES]
1279440 1282780 The amusing thing about this,<br />it's all a big mistake.
1282860 1284450 That particular<br />Starfighter game
1284530 1286450 was supposed to be<br />delivered to Vegas,
1286530 1288450 not some flea-speck<br />trailer park
1288530 1290490 in the middle of tumbleweeds<br />and tarantulas.

1312060 1314890 I told you. I wanna<br />save it for a surprise.
1314980 1319810 Hey. Are you the kind of kid who<br />reads the last page of a mystery first?
1319900 1322280 Who pesters the magician<br />to tell you his tricks?
1322360 1324940 Who sneaks downstairs to peek<br />at his Christmas presents?
1325030 1327280 No. Of course you're not!
1327360 1330160 [TAUNTINGLY] That's why<br />I'm not gonna tell you.
1331490 1332490 Oh, God.

1884880 1886380 You don't trifle<br />with a Bogati.
1886460 1887880 They love to fight.
1887970 1890130 That's why they're<br />perfect for this war.
1892140 1893140 Did you say "war"?
1893220 1894220 But of course!
1894310 1896560 Why else do you<br />think you're here?
1896640 1898640 You were recruited by<br />the Star League to defend...
1898730 1902480 "...to defend the Frontier against<br />Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada."
1904860 1910320 Eons ago, our ancestors<br />created our great Frontier,
1910400 1912660 a barrier of energy
1912740 1915910 encircling the peaceful<br />systems of the universe,
1916620 1920830 and forever shutting out<br />the scourge that lurks beyond.
1923040 1927590 Fellow Rylans,<br />because of a dark betrayal,
1927670 1929630 our Frontier<br />will soon collapse.
1929720 1931130 [ALL MURMURING]
1932340 1937470 So we turn to you,<br />Starfighters and your navigators.
1937560 1941190 For of all the billions of<br />creatures in the Star League,
1941270 1944770 only you few were<br />found to possess the
1946900 1948030 gift.
1949570 1952660 You, and you alone,
1952740 1956490 stand between us and the<br />black terror of the Ko-Dan.
1958790 1960500 Victory or death!
1960620 1962290 Victory or death!

1986690 1990150 you will find a packet<br />which contains one hand...

2008920 2012300 Hi. I'm Alex Rogan. I was<br />playing this game back home,
2012380 2013510 and this guy<br />came up to me.
2013590 2015420 Only he's not a guy.<br />He's an alien, right?
2015510 2018260 And I get into his car. Only<br />it's not a car. It's a spaceship.
2018340 2021760 And, there's been<br />a big mistake.
2021850 2023720 Am I to understand<br />you're actually declining
2023810 2026100 the honor of becoming<br />a Starfighter?
2026190 2027480 You got it.
2027560 2028940 Extraordinary!
2029940 2033690 For eons, all creatures have<br />dreamt of being Starfighters.
2034240 2036200 Where you from?<br />Earth.
2036280 2039450 And we're not at war with anybody,<br />except each other.
2039530 2043240 Earth? Earth isn't a formal<br />member of the Star League,
2043330 2045620 and isn't due to be<br />approached until it matures.
2045710 2048540 This is all<br />highly irregular.
2048620 2050960 Tell me.<br />Who recruited you?
2051040 2052250 Centauri.
2053000 2054050 There he is.<br />That's him!
2054130 2056550 Centauri.<br />I might have known.
2057970 2060220 [SINGING QUIETLY]
2061220 2064930 Up to your old Excalibur<br />tricks again, eh, Centauri?
2065680 2067560 Did it ever occur to you<br />that it is against the law
2067640 2070270 to recruit from worlds<br />outside the Star League?
2070350 2072440 Earth's in danger,<br />too, isn't it?
2072570 2074650 And, no, I did not<br />use the Excalibur test.
2074730 2076360 It was called<br />a video game.
2076440 2077990 What's all the brouhaha?
2078070 2080870 After all,<br />he does have the gift!
2080950 2083330 This may come as<br />a bit of a shock to you,
2083410 2085750 but he doesn't want<br />to be a Starfighter.
2086500 2089620 Doesn't want to be a...<br />Are you a coward?
2089710 2090670 Are you crazy?
2090750 2092380 You didn't tell me<br />about any of this!
2093090 2095050 Return the money, Centauri!
2095130 2098380 Return the money?<br />Are you delirious?
2098470 2100470 Do you know how long<br />it took to invent the games,
2100550 2101680 to merchandise them,
2101760 2104560 to get them into<br />the stores by Christmas?
2105100 2107060 It must be terribly<br />embarrassing for you,
2107140 2109060 and I do sympathize.<br />However...
2109140 2110640 But I saw him fight!
2110730 2112480 He could be the greatest<br />Starfighter ever!
2112560 2114320 That was a game, Centauri.
2114400 2115440 A game?
2115520 2116530 [SCOFFS]
2116610 2119650 You may have thought it was a game,<br />but it was also a test.
2119740 2121410 Aha! A test!
2121490 2125990 Sent out across the universe to find<br />those with the gift to be Starfighters.
2126080 2129000 And here you are, my boy.<br />Here you are!
2129080 2130750 Right! Here I am,<br />about to be killed!
2130830 2131870 Killed.
2131960 2133330 [LAUGHING]
2133630 2136920 You don't seriously think it's dangerous,<br />do you?
2137000 2139470 Don't be silly! Trust me!
2157690 2158820 Xur!
2159650 2160650 Xur!
2161950 2163160 Xur?
2164740 2169830 Yes, Father,<br />your mighty Frontier grows weaker by the moment.
2170910 2173830 Do not call me father!
2174580 2176960 You are no longer my son!
2177040 2180340 You're an outcast!<br />Why have you returned?
2180800 2183720 I have returned for<br />the good of all Rylans.
2183800 2187180 With an armada of Ko-Dan<br />warships behind you?
2187260 2190810 There are some Rylans<br />who would welcome me, Father.
2190890 2194730 Star League justice<br />put down your Xurian cult.
2194810 2197150 Your followers are<br />few and scattered.
2197230 2199360 Star League?
2199440 2202950 A refuge for weak worlds<br />not worthy to be our equals!
2203030 2205450 That is for the Rylans<br />to decide,
2205530 2209540 and not for a dangerous<br />and evil child such as yourself.
2211200 2216000 And yet, it is this child<br />who caught your master spy.
2225970 2227850 [SCREAMING]
2245570 2247240 Hear me, Rylans!
2249070 2254370 When the green moon of Galan is eclipsed,<br />Ko-Dan Armada will invade,
2256080 2260710 and not even your mighty<br />Starfighters will be able to save you.
2260790 2264260 We shall see, Xur.<br />We shall see!

2289950 2292370 and he doesn't want<br />to be a Starfighter.

2350840 2352470 Let him enter.
2352550 2355010 ROBOT: Target vector<br />remains on scope.
2369700 2373160 Just like your Ko-Dan emperor's,<br />isn't it, Commander Kril?
2373240 2379500 It takes more than a scepter to rule,<br />Xur, even on Rylos.
2382210 2383920 You're right, Kril.
2385750 2388260 It does take<br />more than a scepter.

2397060 2399520 How long must we<br />endure this fool?
2401480 2403310 We have a break<br />in the Frontier.

2406770 2410940 My dear Ko-Dan friends!<br />Lest we forget,
2411030 2414870 it was your own emperor who<br />granted me command of this Armada.
2414950 2417870 For only I hold<br />the secret to the Frontier.
2418620 2421290 Only I know the location<br />of the Starfighter base.
2421370 2425080 And therefore,<br />only I will give the order to fire!

2711790 2713210 Hey, Maggie!
2715000 2716960 Listen to this. You're<br />not going to believe this.
2717840 2718920 I told you, Alex.
2719010 2720050 Me and my...<br />How did you put it?
2720130 2723590 "Strange sexual urges,"<br />aren't talking to you anymore.

2764430 2765470 Who's there!
2765550 2767850 Shh! You're gonna<br />wake up Louis.
2776690 2778520 Hey, you look like me!
2778690 2780530 Of course I do.<br />I'm the beta unit.
2781530 2783740 What the hell's<br />a beta unit?
2784030 2790120 A beta unit is a simuloid,<br />an exact duplicate of you, only not as loud.
2791580 2792620 Huh?
2792710 2793960 I was in the starcar,<br />remember?
2794040 2795290 We shook hands?
2795370 2797790 I became you, unfortunately.
2799590 2801880 Let me get this straight.<br />You're a robot?
2802130 2804170 I beg your pardon.
2804880 2808600 I'm a state-of-the-art,<br />top-of-the-line beta unit,
2808680 2812310 put here as a courtesy<br />replacement for while you're away.
2812390 2814180 Lucky me.
2814270 2816150 Wait a minute.<br />What are you doing back?
2816230 2817900 Are you kidding?<br />It's war up there!
2817980 2821070 Oh. Save the whales<br />and not the universe, huh?
2821780 2823650 Well, why don't you<br />go up there and fight?
2823740 2826240 Simuloids can't fight.<br />We're not allowed.
2826320 2828740 Well, tell them that<br />you're me! Pretend!
2828870 2831290 Be quiet, Alex.
2831370 2833040 BOTH: Sorry, Louis.

2894350 2897140 I screamed. I'll apologize tomorrow,<br />okay?
2897230 2898640 You're not gonna be here.
2898730 2900480 You're going back<br />with Centauri right now!

3076950 3078570 Get a good look, Alex.
3078660 3081790 You can bet your asteroids<br />you'll be seeing more of them.
3081870 3083080 What?
3083160 3084580 This is a Zando-Zan.
3084960 3087960 An interstellar hitbeast,<br />compliments of Xur.
3088670 3091090 Xur? Why is he after me?
3091170 3093420 Somehow he found out<br />you're a Starfighter.
3093510 3097090 BETA: So you see, Alex,<br />you got to go back. You got no choice.
3097180 3099090 'Cause if you stay down here,<br />you're dog food.
3099180 3100800 Trust Centauri, my boy.
3100890 3105100 Because in two hours,<br />this place will be crawling with 10 Zando-Zans
3105180 3109100 with just one thought on<br />their microscopic little minds,
3109190 3110770 kill Alex Rogan.
3110860 3112400 Kill Alex Rogan.
3112480 3113900 BETA: He's right, Alex.
3113980 3116610 At least up there you'll have<br />a fighting chance in a Gunstar.
3116700 3117780 Exactly.
3117860 3120870 Meanwhile, down here,<br />they'll be going after Beta.

3431560 3432930 Louis!
3446610 3448110 Oh, no.
3458290 3461750 Am I to understand there's a beta<br />unit taking your place back home?
3461840 3462880 He's trying.
3462960 3466050 So it's safe to assume that<br />Xur thinks you're still on Earth.
3466130 3467880 Yeah.
3467970 3470720 That could work to our advantage,<br />theoretically.
3477730 3480100 Ah! Now you look human!
3482650 3484070 Is this my Gunstar?
3484150 3486570 This is a prototype,<br />different from the other ships.
3486650 3488450 She has a greater range,<br />more power,
3488530 3490660 and a slight<br />weapons modification.
3491870 3493580 And, of course,<br />she's got deflective plating,
3493660 3496080 so she can withstand<br />several direct hits.
3501460 3503630 From here, this is<br />where I navigate the ship,
3503710 3506710 maintain life support<br />and propulsion systems.
3508130 3509380 Okay. Where do I sit?
3509470 3512010 Way up there,<br />in the gunnery chair.
3515220 3516430 Hang on!
3516520 3517560 Okay.
3522810 3525570 Now, climb into<br />the gunnery chair.
3526820 3530490 Now, I'm moving you<br />into launch position.
3531990 3533780 There in front of you<br />are the two switches
3533870 3536200 for your heads-up display.<br />Turn them on.
3540710 3541870 While you're engaging<br />the enemy,
3541960 3545590 the screen will reflect all<br />battle instruments towards you.
3547700 3548660 Hey, where did it go?
3548740 3551330 It's still there,<br />suspended in a xenon mist.
3551410 3553330 But it's only visible<br />if you look dead ahead.
3553590 3555550 Ah. Got it.
3555720 3557680 The lever on your left<br />is the chair controller.
3557770 3561060 As you can see,<br />all guns will track with your every move.
3565520 3566650 [CHUCKLES]
3568780 3571900 Grasp the target control<br />with your right hand.
3571990 3575530 At your fingers is the weaponry,<br />the lasers, photon bolts...
3575620 3576780 Photon bolts and<br />the particle beams.
3576870 3578540 Wait a minute.<br />This is just like back home.
3579120 3580500 What's this?<br />Careful, careful,
3580580 3583870 that's Death Blossom,<br />a weapon of last resort.
3583960 3587130 Luckily, I was in here working on it<br />when the hangar went up.
3587210 3590260 Now, are you ready?<br />All systems, go!
3591260 3592300 [BEEPS]
3592580 3593880 Ignition!
3597840 3599720 When did the hangar go up?
3599800 3602720 I told you,<br />when Xur attacked.
3602890 3604050 And where were<br />the Starfighters?
3604140 3605260 In the hangar!
3605350 3607060 You mean they're dead?
3607140 3609180 Death is a primitive concept.
3610180 3614980 I prefer to think of them as<br />battling evil in another dimension.
3615060 3617730 In another dimension?<br />How many are left?
3617820 3619070 Including yourself?
3619530 3620780 Yeah.
3622030 3623320 One!
3624360 3625450 One?
3627120 3628200 [INAUDIBLE]
3636710 3638000 Hold it.
3640840 3643630 There's no fleet,<br />no Starfighters, no plan?
3643720 3646090 One ship, you, me,<br />and that's it? Exactly!
3646180 3647260 Xur thinks<br />you're still on Earth.
3647350 3649470 Classic military strategy.<br />Surprise attack.
3649560 3650770 It'll be a slaughter!
3650850 3652230 That's the spirit.
3652310 3653730 No, my slaughter.
3653810 3655730 One ship against<br />the whole Armada?
3655810 3659150 Yes. One Gunstar<br />against the Armada.
3659230 3664070 I've always wanted to fight a<br />desperate battle against incredible odds.
3666820 3668030 Target lights, Alex.
3668120 3669240 Target lights?
3669330 3671040 Yes. You might want<br />to squeeze off
3671120 3672790 a few rounds while<br />you have the chance.
3672870 3674870 Just work the bugs<br />out of the system.
3674960 3677080 After all,<br />it is her maiden voyage.
3698560 3700690 Steady.<br />Don't fight the chair.
3700770 3702520 Take your time.<br />Watch your gun sights.
3702530 3704330 Lead your targets.
3704410 3706750 And above all, relax!
3707330 3710460 Terrific. I'm about to get killed<br />a million miles from nowhere

3781950 3784200 Yeah. Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.
3785700 3788160 Come on. Try it again.
3789710 3791580 Did you smell anything?
3793250 3794290 Like what?
3794460 3795540 Like a Z...
3796630 3797960 Forget it.
3805970 3809680 I just wanted to say I'm sorry<br />for slapping you last night.
3810930 3813730 Oh, that's okay, Maggs.<br />I deserved it.
3813810 3815520 I'm sorry.
3815730 3819860 Well, maybe we can make it up to<br />each other tonight at Silver Lake?
3835880 3837290 [GROWLING]
3849100 3851560 The Armada will break<br />through the Frontier here,
3851640 3854060 and reach Rylos in 20 klicks.
3854140 3856900 Squadrons of deck fighters<br />will precede the mother ship.
3856980 3858770 Squadrons?<br />How many squadrons?
3858860 3861110 It isn't the number of<br />squadrons that concerns me.
3861190 3863030 It's this communication<br />turret that sends out
3863110 3864610 the commands to<br />the deck fighters,
3864700 3866950 which enables them to<br />act as one during the fight.
3867030 3869700 Wait a second. We knock<br />out the turret to get the fighters.
3869790 3872290 But to get the turret,<br />we have to get through the fighters.
3872370 3873750 We're dead.
3873830 3876670 I'll have it all figured out by<br />the time we reach the Frontier.
3876750 3878210 [ALARM BLARING]
3879800 3880960 What's that?
3881050 3882090 The Frontier.
3891430 3893480 Now, that's strange.<br />What's a cargo ship
3893560 3895350 doing this close<br />to the Frontier?
3896230 3898940 GRIG: Hail.<br />This is Gunstar One.
3903650 3905490 I repeat,<br />this is Gunstar One.
3905570 3907740 Identify yourself, please.
3909950 3911540 Alex, look out.

3935530 3937200 I've blocked its<br />beam of frequency,
3937320 3939290 so it can't report<br />back to the Armada.

3952380 3955220 We mustn't lose them in these caves, Alex! Fire!

4010260 4012430 My deepest apologies, Alex.
4013180 4015560 I had hoped that by putting<br />you in the thick of battle,

5588120 5590910 You should be proud<br />of Alex, Mrs. Rogan.
5591450 5592710 You must all be<br />proud of him.
5592790 5596580 He saved the Star League and hundreds of worlds,<br />including Earth.
5596670 5598460 ELVIRA:<br />Oh, for heaven's sake!
5598630 5600460 Oh, my God!
5602260 5604300 Time to leave, Alex.

5608930 5611680 Oh, Alex, I always knew<br />you'd leave someday,
5611770 5613560 but I never expected this.
5613640 5615850 Gee, can I go, too, Alex?<br />Can I?
5615940 5618560 Sorry,<br />squirt. There's only enough room up there
5618650 5621320 for me, Grig,<br />and Maggie.
5622990 5624650 Me?<br />Yeah.
5626200 5628490 Alex, I don't think I can...
5628570 5631080 What? Come here.<br />Come here.
5631870 5633620 Why else do you<br />think I came back?
5633700 5636710 Well... Didn't we say<br />we'd always be together?
5636790 5640340 Well, yeah, I mean,<br />together here or in the city.

5644130 5646010 I don't know when<br />I'm gonna be back.
5646090 5647090 [SIGHS]
5647180 5649010 Don't you see? This is it.<br />This is our big chance.
5649100 5651390 It's like what Otis says,
5651470 5653100 when it comes,<br />you got to grab on
5653180 5654890 with both hands<br />and hold tight.
5657940 5660190 Well, what about<br />Granny, Alex?
5665360 5668110 You're right. I'm<br />scared of leaving here.
5669370 5670950 Why can't you just stay?
5671030 5674580 Maggie, I have to leave,<br />and I want you to come with me.
