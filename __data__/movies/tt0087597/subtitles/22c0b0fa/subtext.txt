173100 174144 Good morning.
174244 176140 It's 8:00 in wonderful Coombs County,
176240 179240 where once again state police<br />have refused to confirm or deny
179340 181709 more of those mysterious<br />"lights in the sky" sightings
181810 182916 by local residents.
183016 185329 Roving air reporters spoke<br />with Miss Josie Floss,
185429 186989 who made just such a sighting.
187089 189706 I've seen those lights with my own eyes.
189806 191472 And when I called the police,
191573 193611 they told me it was swamp gas.
194805 197858 Bullshit! Ain't no swamps<br />in Coombs County!
197958 199985 I tell you,<br />with them illegal aliens...
200085 202646 Gonna be a sparkling day.
203507 205013 Sparkling.
206248 209311 Makes me crazy! Clara!
209907 211192 Clara!
211472 213907 My electrics gone out again, Clara!
214007 215450 I'm gonna miss my soaps!
215550 217361 - Oh, stop your yakking.<br />- Bill?
217561 220063 Bill, Elvira's blacked out again.
220163 221266 Pass the word.
221366 222566 Have a nice day, honey.
222666 224226 Okay, thanks, Mrs. Boone.<br />You, too.
224818 226745 Elvira's got no electric.
226845 229450 If she can't see her soaps,<br />she'll hyperventilate.
230240 231758 Great day for a picnic, Maggie!
231858 233784 Can't wait, Mr. Boone.<br />Catch yourself a big one!
233884 234986 If I can!
235086 236721 Granny, I fixed your lunch
236822 238567 - and put it in the fridge.<br />- Have fun, child.
238667 239715 Sure you're gonna be okay?
239815 241018 I'll be fine, dear.
241118 243328 Now you just run along. Bye!
248392 249501 Hi, Mrs. Rogan.
249601 250627 Hi, Maggie.
250727 252580 Did you find that picnic basket yet?
252880 253964 It's in the living room.
254064 255908 Oh, thanks.<br />Where's Alex?
256008 257214 Where else?
257584 258694 Right.
259837 261121 Louis.
264551 266269 Good morning, space-son Louis.
266500 268380 - Earthling.<br />- Louis!
269204 270408 Jane!
270672 272933 Elvira's electric is out again,
273033 275870 and she's gonna get hyper<br />if she can't see her soaps!
277254 280682 Granny,<br />tell Elvira that Alex will be over
280782 282626 to patch her electric in time for the soaps.
282726 284982 I'll tell her, Jane.<br />Elvira!
285087 286490 - Louis!<br />- Elvira!
286600 287705 Louis!
288115 289958 Go tell Alex that I need him.
290058 291360 Beware, aliens.
291460 293300 Louis Rogan, the cosmic cadet,
293400 296011 the space avenger, is on your case.

423125 424526 Yeah?
424686 427295 Honey, Elvira's electric is out.
428046 430132 Oh, Ma, that's gonna take all day.
430232 432092 I was going to Silver Lake.
432192 435879 Honey, I know. I'm sorry.<br />I'm working lunch and dinner.
435979 438061 I'm gonna be in town all day!
440283 442836 Oh, all right. Okay, Ma. I'll do it.
443370 444813 Thanks, honey.
447114 448917 We're gonna be late.
451887 453105 Look. You...
453440 454940 You'd better just go ahead without me.
455040 456299 No. Alex, I'll stay.
456425 458468 No. That's okay.<br />This'll take a while.
458893 460497 I'll catch up with you later.
461555 462723 Alex...
469980 471388 Bye-bye, Rogan!
471488 472691 See you, dude!
476678 479256 Alex, come help me!
480657 483543 Hey, Alex.<br />Could you give me a hand here?
487404 489206 Thanks, Alex!
508919 510721 What should we do tonight?
511688 513548 I don't know.
514274 515676 How about cards?
515776 517611 Hey, that's a good idea.
517736 519621 Yeah, but we played cards last night.
520697 521907 Well...
523004 525072 The missus wants to go into town tonight...
525173 526274 and go dancing.
556883 560290 The fish were really biting<br />down there at the stream.
561051 563854 It was pleasant fishing today.
564574 567577 Yup. It's gonna be pleasant tomorrow, too.
569162 572749 Gonna be a pleasant summer<br />according to Farmer's Almanac.
573083 575085 Yeah. Love the Farmer's Almanac.
575252 577254 I've been reading it for years.
579339 580900 Greetings, Starfighter.
581000 583500 You have been recruited by the Star League
583600 586937 to defend the Frontier against Xur<br />and the Ko-Dan Armada.
587138 588547 Yeah. Yeah.
588807 591226 Get ready.<br />Prepare for blastoff.
596982 599870 Prepare for target light practice, Starfighter.
609786 611021 Oh, hi, Alex.
611181 612289 Hey, Otis.
616418 618111 Where's your Maggie?
619509 620914 Good question.
621114 622916 Out having a good time, I guess.
624592 627070 And you never have a good time.
627170 628305 Is that it?
628405 631208 Oh, sure. I love patching<br />30-year-old fuse panels
631308 633460 and plunging people's toilets.
634311 635629 Otis, I never even get a chance
635729 637234 to have a good time around here.
639024 640633 Things change.
641084 642769 Always do.
645847 647891 You'll get your chance.
647991 650227 Important thing is, when it comes,
650327 652768 you got to grab it with both hands...
652869 654369 and hold on tight.
658126 660326 Enemy squadrons in Sectors 3, 6, 7,
660427 661496 closing fast.
670680 671848 Thanks, Jack.
671948 672974 You're welcome.
673074 674651 - Good night, Maggie.<br />- Good night.
708176 710120 Thought you were gonna<br />meet me at the lake.
710220 711421 What happened?
712263 714315 Same thing that always happens.<br />I couldn't get away.
717769 719254 Where's everybody else?
719679 721264 Oh, they went to a movie.
723775 726803 Old Jack Blake just happened<br />to be going your way, huh?
726903 728990 Enemy squadron in Sector 3.
730865 732851 He said it was on his way home.
732951 735120 Blake lives on the other side of town.
735412 737263 Come on, Alex.
738321 740290 I wanted to get back to you.
743288 744547 Okay?
749843 752349 Good show, Starfighter!<br />Way to go.
753596 755278 Alex, look!
756159 757583 Oh, my God. What is that?
757684 758893 900,000!
764149 766748 900,000!
766889 769095 You gonna bust the record!
771031 773128 Hey! Hey!
773229 775744 Listen up, everybody!
775844 778449 Alex is going for the record!
779406 780624 Record?
780725 782406 - Take... Take a hand.<br />- Let's go. Let's go.
782600 785170 Got them!<br />Oh, he's gonna get that one!
789215 790617 You can do it!
791676 792886 Otis?
794501 795771 It's so exciting.
795872 798241 Otis, what are you yelling about?<br />What's wrong?
798341 800410 Come on! Come on!
800510 802395 He's going to bust the record!
803913 805273 Hurry! Hurry!
805373 807667 Everyone get back!<br />Don't crowd him!
807807 809691 I said, get back!
818236 820613 Alex, you never got this far before!
820813 822090 Go, Alex!
822690 824190 Come on, Alex!
827800 829000 Good boy!
831024 833776 Ko-Dan command ship entering kill zone.
833876 834944 Command ship!
835044 836237 Oh, command ship!
836337 837864 What's a command ship?
837964 840044 You can do it, Alex!<br />You can do it!
844245 845845 One more. One more now.
845945 847345 Come on! That's the one!
847448 848950 That's the one we want!
858406 860413 - Yeah!<br />- Yeah!
893102 895605 - Good night.<br />- Way to go, Alex!
895705 896731 Good night, kids.
896831 898332 Alex, you're something else.
898438 899842 You're wonderful, boy.
899942 901450 - Thank you.<br />- If I said it once,
901550 903470 I said it a thousand times.
903571 906171 - That boy's gonna go places.<br />- That's one smart boy.
921254 922680 Good night, Alex.
925059 927670 "Good night, Alex" ?<br />Wait a second.
927770 929789 Maggie? Maggie?
931524 933530 Hold on a second.<br />Where are you going?
939007 940250 What's wrong?
941801 944887 Well, I guess it just hit me.
945596 947799 You really are leaving here, aren't you?
948000 950250 Of course, I'm leaving.<br />We're both gonna leave here.
950350 952154 - Both of us, Alex?<br />- Yeah.
952854 954859 We talked about this.
955189 956591 When I get to school,<br />I'm gonna find a place
956691 958051 and I'm gonna come back and get you.
958151 959694 Well, what about Granny?
960611 961846 Granny?
964265 966367 Truth is, you're scared<br />of leaving this trailer park.
966467 968870 I'm not scared of leaving<br />this trailer park, Alex.
968970 970613 Hey. Listen.
973524 977253 Whatever happens,<br />it's you and me forever, right?
978821 980031 Right?
982759 984827 I love you so much, Alex.
984927 987011 I'll always love you, Maggs.
991000 992935 Diarrhoea.
1008586 1009791 Maggie!
1010282 1011888 Maggie!
1012455 1014140 Alex, I got to go in.
1014941 1016142 Good night.
1016292 1017911 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
1037400 1040685 Someday they're gonna say,<br />"This is where it all began."
1041692 1042719 What?
1042819 1045413 Mom, I finally broke the Starfighter record.
1046655 1048199 That's nice, dear.
1048350 1049350 Nice?
1049475 1051024 It's stupendous!
1052000 1053100 Alex,
1053300 1056370 Mr. Brenner knew that you'd want<br />to see this as soon as possible,
1056470 1058581 so he brought it by the diner and...
1059085 1061312 Well, I was so excited,<br />I opened it.
1061712 1063831 Oh, that's okay.<br />What is it?
1063931 1065425 It's about your loan.
1071097 1074599 You can still go to City College<br />with your friends.
1115391 1116910 Greetings, Starfighter.
1121898 1122982 Greetings, Starfighter.
1123082 1125762 You have been recruited by the Star League<br />to defend the Frontier.
1125902 1127011 You have been recruited...
1127111 1128221 Greetings, Starfighter.
1128321 1129739 You have been recruited...
1130807 1132309 You have been recruited...
1133202 1134646 You have been recruited...
1137607 1139692 Get ready.<br />Prepare for blastoff.
1184293 1186587 Hello. Excuse me, son.
1188839 1190408 Store's closed, mister.
1190508 1193161 I'm not here for cigarettes<br />or bubble gum, my boy.
1193361 1194637 Can you tell me the name of the person
1194737 1196289 who broke the record<br />on that game over there?
1196389 1197807 Where I might find him?
1199850 1202852 Alex Rogan.<br />You're looking at him.
1203521 1205528 Alex Rogan...
1206899 1208968 - Who are you?<br />- Centauri's the name.
1209068 1211387 I invented Starfighter,<br />which is why I'm here.
1211487 1212805 - It is?<br />- It is.
1212905 1215563 We have to talk about a matter<br />of utmost importance.
1215663 1217066 Step into my office.
1217326 1219904 That's it. Come on now.
1220486 1222286 Nothing to be afraid of.
1227420 1230214 Oh, yes.<br />Say hello to my assistant, Beta.
1231202 1232403 Howdy.
1235553 1238664 I must congratulate you on your<br />virtuoso performance, my boy.
1238764 1240164 Centauri is impressed.
1240266 1241726 I've seen them come<br />and I've seen them go.
1241826 1243836 But you're the best, my boy.<br />Dazzling.
1243936 1245938 Light years ahead of the competition.
1246063 1248067 Which is why Centauri is here.
1248816 1250876 He's got a little proposition for you.
1251819 1253029 Are you interested?
1254363 1255598 I guess.
1257523 1258531 Hey!
1265166 1266375 What are you doing?
1266475 1267501 Listen.
1267601 1269337 Centauri wants to keep it for a surprise.
1269437 1270455 Trust me.
1270806 1273258 Oh, you're gonna love it.<br />Love it!
1279305 1282625 The amusing thing about this,<br />it's all a big mistake.
1282725 1284293 That particular Starfighter game
1284393 1286295 was supposed to be delivered to Vegas,
1286395 1288297 not some flea-speck trailer park
1288397 1290401 in the middle of tumbleweeds<br />and tarantulas.
1290501 1293427 So, it must be fate,<br />destiny, blind chance,
1293527 1295379 luck, even, that brings us together.
1296072 1299158 And as the poet says,<br />"The rest is history."
1309460 1311821 Where are you going?<br />Where are you taking me?
1311921 1314730 I told you.<br />I wanna save it for a surprise.
1314840 1319422 Hey. Are you the kind of kid who reads<br />the last page of a mystery first?
1319762 1322123 Who pesters the magician<br />to tell you his tricks?
1322223 1324792 Who sneaks downstairs to peek<br />at his Christmas presents?
1324892 1327098 No. Of course you're not!
1327228 1330122 ♪ That's why I'm not gonna tell you. ♪
1331407 1332508 Oh, God.
1334051 1335150 Besides,
1335251 1337846 I just love surprises, don't you?
1338531 1339974 Hey, look out!
1340429 1341434 - Stop!<br />- Oh, dear!
1341534 1343385 Hit the brakes! Hey...
1402553 1405014 Shifting into star drive at Columba Zeta.
1405114 1406324 Hold tight.
1526802 1530097 Hey.<br />Hey, let me out of here!
1571921 1574726 There's a perfectly logical explanation for all this.
1592534 1594223 Hey! Wait! Where you going?
1609218 1610904 Hi! How are you?
1611285 1612488 What is this?
1613247 1615253 Listen. Do you speak English? I'd...
1616308 1617851 This is nice but...
1631240 1632933 Centauri, what's going on here?
1633033 1635185 He's just saying how delighted he is<br />that you're here.
1635285 1636395 And if there's anything he can do
1636495 1638697 to make your stay more enjoyable,<br />just give him a ring.
1638797 1641775 My stay? What are you talking about?<br />Where are we?
1641875 1644019 Welcome to Rylos, my boy!
1645004 1646171 Rylos?
1646797 1647907 Wait a minute. You mean...
1648108 1649216 You mean like in a game?
1649316 1651260 Oh, he's quick.<br />He's quick. He's very quick.
1651360 1654330 He's speechless.<br />So long, Alex! Have fun!
1654430 1657750 May the luck of the Seven Pillars of Gulu<br />be with you at all times.
1657950 1661453 Oh, someday these cheapskates<br />will thank Centauri. Trust me.
1666100 1668118 Where the hell is June?
1673282 1675564 Yolanda, bébé!
1686200 1687604 Hi, Maggs.
1688530 1689935 Hi, Louis.
1690799 1691909 Is he up?
1692009 1696055 Yeah. He's been up<br />all night moaning.
1700893 1702227 Alex?
1706273 1708776 Your mother told me<br />about the loan.
1709318 1711403 Is there anything I can do?
1718035 1721413 Listen. I'll be next door<br />if you need anything, okay?
1798240 1799366 Gunstars.
1801451 1803245 I got to be dreaming.
1808125 1809168 Yeah, right.
1817092 1819411 Listen, there's been<br />a big mistake.
1819511 1821371 ...immediately<br />after situation report.
1821471 1822539 Navigation...
1822639 1825000 Welcome to<br />Starfighter Command.
1825100 1826126 You speak English?
1826226 1828921 No. You hear English, thanks<br />to your translator device.
1829021 1830589 Hurry up.<br />We haven't got much time.
1830689 1832733 The briefing<br />begins immediately.
1833275 1834885 Join the other recruits.
1834985 1836778 Wait a minute!<br />Wait a minute!
1837029 1838906 Wait a minute! What are you<br />talking about, recruits?
1842242 1843994 I don't believe this.
1847122 1851360 Attention. Attention, please.<br />Ambassador Enduran has arrived
1851460 1854755 and will now address<br />Starfighter Command personnel.
1857674 1859178 As you all know,
1859279 1861737 we have been on a desperate quest...
1861837 1863372 Excuse me. Excuse me.
1863472 1865078 ...to find Starfighters and navigators.
1868602 1872287 I should... I should crush you<br />to gorun dust!
1872898 1875376 I'm sorry...<br />It was an accident.
1875676 1877359 I didn't mean to<br />step on your...
1878111 1879429 Whatever that is.
1879529 1880597 Hideous creature.
1880697 1882299 If I may continue.
1883158 1884643 Our forces have...
1884743 1886228 You don't trifle with a Bogati.
1886328 1887729 They love to fight.
1887829 1890098 That's why they're perfect for this war.
1892000 1893085 Did you say "war"?
1893185 1894269 But of course!
1894369 1896405 Why else do you think you're here?
1896505 1898890 You were recruited by the Star League<br />to defend...
1898990 1902544 "...to defend the Frontier<br />against Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada."
1904721 1910169 Eons ago, our ancestors<br />created our great Frontier,
1910269 1912474 a barrier of energy
1912604 1916204 encircling the peaceful systems of the universe,
1916583 1920786 and forever shutting out<br />the scourge that lurks beyond.
1922806 1927286 Fellow Rylans,<br />because of a dark betrayal,
1927536 1929796 our Frontier will soon collapse.
1932207 1937321 So we turn to you, Starfighters<br />and your navigators.
1937421 1941033 For of all the billions of creatures<br />in the Star League,
1941133 1944636 only you few were found to possess the...
1946803 1947959 ...gift.
1949400 1952400 You, and you alone,
1952602 1956406 stand between us<br />and the black terror of the Ko-Dan.
1958650 1960460 Victory or death!
1960585 1962137 Victory or death!
1962287 1965315 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1965415 1968193 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1968293 1971113 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1971213 1973865 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1973965 1976702 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1976802 1979705 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1979805 1982974 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1983425 1986553 Now, Starfighters,<br />if you will reach underneath your seats,
1986653 1990215 you will find a packet<br />which contains one hand...
1993894 1996895 This is a restricted area, off-limits to...
1999691 2002491 My apologies, Starfighter.
2002736 2006073 Star Navigator First Class Grig,<br />at your service, sir!
2008800 2012062 Hi. I'm Alex Rogan.<br />I was playing this game back home,
2012162 2013272 and this guy came up to me.
2013372 2015190 Only he's not a guy.<br />He's an alien, right?
2015290 2018026 And I get into his car.<br />Only it's not a car, it's a spaceship.
2018126 2021530 And, there's been a big mistake.
2021630 2023490 Am I to understand<br />you're actually declining
2023590 2025967 the honour of becoming a Starfighter?
2026067 2027244 You got it.
2027344 2029150 Extraordinary!
2029721 2033475 For eons, all creatures have dreamt<br />of being Starfighters.
2034017 2036061 - Where you from?<br />- Earth.
2036161 2039361 And we're not at war with anybody,<br />except each other.
2039461 2040461 Earth?
2040864 2043210 Earth isn't a formal member<br />of the Star League,
2043310 2045487 and isn't due to be approached<br />until it matures.
2045587 2048107 This is all highly irregular.
2048407 2050726 Tell me.<br />Who recruited you?
2050826 2052035 Centauri.
2052786 2053912 There he is. That's him!
2054012 2056431 Centauri.<br />I might have known.
2061002 2064814 Up to your old Excalibur<br />tricks again, eh, Centauri?
2065465 2067526 Did it ever occur to you<br />that it is against the law
2067626 2070227 to recruit from worlds<br />outside the Star League?
2070327 2072132 Earth's in danger, too, isn't it?
2072247 2074516 And, no, I did not use the Excalibur test.
2074616 2076126 It was called a video game.
2076226 2077753 What's all the brouhaha?
2077853 2080860 After all, he does have the gift!
2080960 2082960 This may come as a bit of a shock to you,
2083291 2085527 but he doesn't want to be a Starfighter.
2086278 2087782 Doesn't want to be a...
2087983 2089389 Are you a coward?
2089489 2090632 Are you crazy?
2090732 2092539 You didn't tell me about any of this!
2092968 2095011 Return the money, Centauri!
2095111 2098148 Return the money?<br />Are you delirious?
2098248 2100333 Do you know how long it took<br />to invent the games,
2100433 2101543 to merchandise them,
2101643 2103747 to get them into the stores by Christmas?
2104980 2107023 It must be terribly embarrassing for you,
2107123 2108725 and I do sympathize.
2108825 2110510 - However...<br />- But I saw him fight!
2110610 2112445 He could be the greatest Starfighter ever!
2112545 2114181 That was a game, Centauri.
2114281 2115323 A game?
2116491 2119519 You may have thought it was a game,<br />but it was also a test.
2120219 2121271 A test!
2121371 2125779 Sent out across the universe<br />to find those with the gift to be Starfighters.
2125959 2128962 And here you are, my boy.<br />Here you are!
2129062 2130864 Right! Here I am,<br />about to be killed!
2130964 2131964 Killed.
2133508 2136086 You don't seriously think<br />it's dangerous, do you?
2136886 2139387 Don't be silly! Trust me!
2157500 2158700 Xur!
2159534 2160535 Xur!
2161828 2162938 Xur?
2164623 2169911 Yes, Father, your mighty Frontier<br />grows weaker by the moment.
2170795 2173715 Do not call me father!
2174466 2176826 You are no longer my son!
2176926 2180221 You're an outcast!<br />Why have you returned?
2180680 2183583 I have returned for the good of all Rylans.
2183683 2187045 With an armada of Ko-Dan warships<br />behind you?
2187145 2190674 There are some Rylans<br />who would welcome me, Father.
2190774 2194594 Star League justice<br />put down your Xurian cult.
2194694 2197013 Your followers are few and scattered.
2197113 2199224 Star League?
2199324 2202811 A refuge for weak worlds<br />not worthy to be our equals!
2202911 2205313 That is for the Rylans to decide,
2205413 2209417 and not for a dangerous and<br />evil child such as yourself.
2211086 2215882 And yet, it is this child<br />who caught your master spy.
2245453 2247122 Hear me, Rylans!
2248957 2251811 When the green moon of Galan is eclipsed,
2251912 2254454 Ko-Dan Armada will invade.
2255964 2258632 And not even your mighty Starfighters
2258733 2260577 will be able to save you.
2260677 2262333 We shall see, Xur.
2263034 2264279 We shall see!
2277168 2278637 You still want to go?
2278837 2280521 And miss all the excitement?
2286344 2287554 Little brat.
2287654 2289931 I invent the game, find the kid,<br />drag him up there,
2290031 2292233 and he doesn't wanna be a Starfighter.
2292400 2293900 I give up!
2330346 2334475 Control, do you copy our star<br />angle difference from parking angle?
2335643 2340331 Delta beta two at six,<br />delta gamma three at five.
2345820 2348823 Emperor Xur ordered me to bring his sceptre.
2350825 2352305 Let him enter.
2352535 2354996 Target vector remains on scope.
2369677 2373122 Just like your Ko-Dan emperor's,<br />isn't it, Commander Kril?
2373222 2377110 It takes more than a sceptre<br />to rule, Xur,
2377701 2379729 even on Rylos.
2382190 2383900 You're right, Kril.
2385735 2388317 It does take more than a sceptre.
2397038 2399499 How long must we endure this fool?
2401559 2403378 We have a break in the Frontier.
2403478 2405171 Fire the meteor gun!
2406756 2410810 My dear Ko-Dan friends!<br />Lest we forget,
2411010 2414831 it was your own emperor<br />who granted me command of this Armada.
2415031 2417920 For only I hold the secret to the Frontier.
2418601 2421554 Only I know the location<br />of the Starfighter base.
2421654 2425156 And therefore,<br />only I will give the order to fire!
2429362 2431247 Forgive me, Xur.
2437682 2439971 You are forgiven, Commander Kril.
2443668 2445076 Meteor gunner...
2446207 2447260 fire.
2480163 2481456 Sergeant!
2483816 2487628 I have an unidentified incoming object<br />in Sector 31, sir.
2491941 2493743 They're headed for the base!
2494244 2496145 Alert!<br />We are under attack!
2496245 2498422 I repeat,<br />we are under attack!
2499407 2501608 Activate automatic repulser guns.
2555963 2559091 Condition Red! Condition Red!
2568142 2570149 At last, it is done!
2571604 2573614 Soon the Frontier will be down
2573881 2576334 and they will bow to their new emperor!
2577235 2579045 Or I will darken the sky with their ashes.
2579145 2580905 Commander, the Xurian spy reports
2581005 2582893 that one Starfighter has escaped.
2583741 2585117 Escaped?
2597947 2599260 You sure I can't give you a hand?
2599360 2601369 You've done quite enough already.<br />Thank you.
2601509 2602677 Well...
2604470 2606372 It's only a few more miles from here.<br />I guess...
2606472 2608016 I guess I can walk it.
2608516 2609586 So long!
2610587 2611827 Bye, Centauri!
2623948 2625750 Oh, Alex!
2627702 2628786 Here!
2633149 2635433 Hey, listen.<br />I can't take a present from you, Centauri.
2636585 2637962 He reduces me to poverty again
2638062 2639530 and he thinks I'm giving him a present.
2639630 2640881 What a world this is.
2641007 2642241 What is it, then?
2642341 2644243 It's a second chance, my boy!
2644343 2647543 If you change your mind,<br />just tap the communo-crystals.
2652200 2654480 - Keep it<br />- Alex, Alex!
2654812 2657415 You're walking away from history.<br />History!
2657815 2661022 Did Chris Columbus say<br />he wanted to stay home? No!
2661402 2663971 What if the Wright Brothers thought<br />that only birds should fly?
2664071 2667600 And did Geloca think the Yulus<br />were too ugly to save?
2667950 2669410 Who's Geloca?
2671287 2672563 Never mind.
2674290 2675846 Listen, Centauri.<br />I'm not any of those guys.
2675946 2677351 I'm a kid from a trailer park.
2677451 2681010 If that's what you think,<br />then that's all you'll ever be!
2711519 2712937 Hey, Maggie!
2714830 2716891 Listen to this.<br />You're not going to believe this.
2717666 2718734 I told you, Alex.
2718834 2719860 Me and my...<br />How did you put it?
2719960 2723442 "Strange sexual urges,"<br />aren't talking to you anymore.
2764255 2765281 Who's there!
2766081 2768285 You're gonna wake up Louis.
2776517 2778352 Hey, you look like me!
2778589 2780674 Of course I do. I'm the beta unit.
2781285 2783166 What the hell's a beta unit?
2783858 2786859 A beta unit is a simuloid,
2787060 2788514 an exact duplicate of you,
2788616 2790217 only not as loud.
2792433 2793868 I was in the starcar, remember?
2793968 2795102 We shook hands?
2795202 2796626 I became you,
2796777 2798001 unfortunately.
2799415 2800500 Let me get this straight...
2800701 2802109 You're a robot?
2802209 2804013 I beg your pardon.
2804712 2808117 I'm a state-of-the-art,<br />top-of-the-line beta unit,
2808507 2811989 put here as a courtesy replacement<br />for while you're away.
2812219 2813696 Lucky me.
2814096 2816096 Wait a minute.<br />What are you doing back?
2816196 2817848 Are you kidding?<br />It's war up there!
2818608 2821115 Save the whales and not the universe, huh?
2821604 2823464 Well, why don't you go up there and fight?
2823564 2826053 Simuloids can't fight.<br />We're not allowed.
2826180 2828869 Well, tell them that you're me!<br />Pretend!
2829094 2831097 Be quiet, Alex.
2831197 2832485 Sorry, Louis.
2833849 2835226 Thanks for the lift!
2835326 2837134 Sure thing, buddy. See you around!
2859250 2861058 Greetings, Starfighter.
2861268 2863629 You have been recruited by the Star League
2863729 2865933 to defend the Frontier against Xur and...
2886835 2888520 And, hey, what did you do to Maggie?
2888620 2889822 Do to her?
2889922 2891323 We're sitting outside, looking at the stars,
2891423 2893507 and she sticks her tongue in my ear.
2894176 2895199 I screamed.
2895400 2897004 I'll apologize tomorrow, okay?
2897104 2898456 You're not gonna be here.
2898556 2900607 You're going back with Centauri,<br />right now!
2900708 2901908 What's up, Alex?
2902009 2904595 Back to sleep, Louis,<br />or I'm telling Ma about your Playboys.
2907201 2908752 You're blowing it, Alex!
2913654 2915306 What the shit?
2915406 2918989 I said, back to sleep, Louis,<br />or I'm telling Ma about your Playboys!
2920684 2922194 Come in, Centauri.
2923400 2924600 Come on. Get back here,
2924700 2926384 and take your Tonka toy with you.
2927220 2928820 Greetings, Starfighter.
2929003 2931225 You have been recruited<br />by the Star League
2931426 2933593 to defend the Frontier against Xur
2933694 2935242 and the Ko-Dan Armada.
2936010 2937661 Greetings, Starfighter.
2937861 2939421 You have been recruited by the Star League
2939521 2941810 to defend the Frontier against Xur...
2946453 2948723 Where are you?<br />Come on, where are you?
2949023 2950357 Centauri?
2951317 2953123 Greetings, Starfighter!
2954500 2955700 Centauri?
3017841 3019245 Oh, shit!
3019600 3021481 Come on, Alex.<br />Don't be such a wimp!
3039046 3040154 Centauri, look out!
3040354 3041421 What the...
3069403 3072407 Foul stench.<br />Dirty creatures.
3076885 3078435 Get a good look, Alex.
3078585 3081587 You can bet your asteroids<br />you'll be seeing more of them.
3081857 3082960 What?
3083190 3084808 This is a Zando-Zan.
3084983 3087986 An interstellar hitbeast,<br />compliments of Xur.
3088695 3091198 Xur? Why is he after me?
3091298 3093333 Somehow he found out you're a Starfighter.
3093603 3097104 So you see, Alex, you gotta go back.<br />You got no choice.
3097204 3099206 'Cause if you stay down here,<br />you're dog food.
3099306 3100816 Trust Centauri, my boy.
3100916 3102435 Because in two hours,
3102536 3105112 this place will be crawling with 10 Zando-Zans
3105212 3108916 with just one thought<br />on their microscopic little minds,
3109216 3110984 kill Alex Rogan.
3111084 3112411 Kill Alex Rogan.
3112511 3113912 He's right, Alex.
3114012 3116692 At least up there you have<br />a fighting chance in a Gunstar.
3116800 3117800 Exactly.
3117900 3120880 Meanwhile, down here,<br />they'll be going after Beta.
3120980 3122562 - Beta.<br />- Beta?
3122662 3124764 Of course.<br />What do you think he's here for?
3125064 3127264 Wait a...<br />Wait a second here, Centauri.
3127442 3128652 Alex, look out!
3136600 3137619 Centauri!
3139307 3140414 Beta, get a doctor!
3140514 3143014 No. No native cures.<br />No witch doctors.
3143281 3145681 I'm fine. It's... just a scratch.
3148588 3150182 Now face it, Alex.
3150400 3152250 You're a born Starfighter.
3154536 3155963 Are you with me?
3165950 3167830 Okay, let's go, Centauri.
3170277 3171680 Good luck, Alex.
3174805 3176805 You, too, Alex.
3199848 3202084 Centauri to Starfighter Command.
3202868 3204786 Centauri to Starfighter Command.
3204886 3206291 Come in, please.
3223050 3224450 Hey, Centauri.
3227600 3229400 Attention all personnel.
3229503 3231991 Starcar approaching Docking Bay 12.
3233100 3235393 Centauri! Centauri!
3240554 3242089 Hey, hit the brakes!
3242189 3244589 Starcar approaching Docking Bay 12.
3248021 3250023 - Grig! Hey, Grig!<br />- Alex!
3250123 3251925 They got Centauri. He's hurt!
3252400 3253650 He's right over here.
3265403 3267689 Ah, you see?
3268917 3270502 Centauri brought him back!
3270602 3272487 Yes, I see. Don't talk.
3273213 3275115 Does he have my money, Alex?
3275215 3278084 I have a fortune for you, Centauri.
3278206 3279809 Now, please be still.
3281221 3282868 It's here. It's all here.
3282969 3284549 Piles and piles of it.
3285403 3286803 All for you.
3290272 3291675 At last.
3293894 3295136 Alex,
3296607 3298607 I want you to know,<br />it was for the greatest good
3298707 3299907 I brought you back.
3302117 3303317 Of course,
3306163 3308456 it never hurts to be rich.
3318400 3320603 Until the next dimension,
3321309 3322790 old friend.
3325015 3326725 I'm sorry, Alex.
3327504 3328707 Centauri?
3334401 3335605 Centauri?
3337404 3339992 The Frontier could collapse at any moment.
3341104 3342564 Alex!
3399102 3400992 Now I need an ear job.
3401163 3402972 I'm dying here. Dying.
3417774 3418828 Alex,
3418929 3421329 what the hell's going on?
3421528 3422803 Louis,
3423004 3425278 you're having a terrible nightmare.
3425552 3426778 Go back to sleep.
3431329 3432406 Louis!
3446386 3448267 Oh, no.
3458064 3461569 Am I to understand there's a beta unit<br />taking your place back home?
3461669 3462696 He's trying.
3462796 3465805 So it's safe to assume that Xur<br />thinks you're still on Earth.
3465905 3467111 Yeah.
3467851 3469652 That could work to our advantage,
3469863 3470903 theoretically.
3478550 3480578 Now you look human!
3482522 3483923 Is this my Gunstar?
3484023 3486426 This is a prototype,<br />different from the other ships.
3486526 3488326 She has a greater range,<br />more power,
3488426 3490426 and a slight weapons modification.
3491739 3493543 And, of course,<br />she's got deflective plating,
3493643 3496162 so she can withstand several direct hits.
3501332 3503985 From here, this is<br />where I navigate the ship,
3504085 3506588 maintain life support<br />and propulsion systems.
3508200 3509640 Okay. So where do I sit?
3509740 3511985 Way up there, in the gunnery chair.
3515206 3516409 Hang on!
3516609 3517712 Okay.
3522887 3525770 Now, climb into the gunnery chair.
3526801 3527801 Now,
3528702 3530902 I'm moving you into launch position.
3532003 3533740 There in front of you are the two switches
3533840 3535341 for your heads-up display.
3535622 3536825 Turn them on.
3540680 3541960 While you're engaging the enemy,
3542060 3544460 the screen will reflect all battle instruments
3544560 3545560 towards you.
3547600 3548603 Hey, where did it go?
3548703 3551362 It's still there,<br />suspended in a xenon mist.
3551462 3553614 But it's only visible if you look dead ahead.
3554354 3555354 Got it.
3555490 3557490 The lever on your left is the chair controller.
3557600 3560800 As you can see, all guns will track<br />with your every move.
3568516 3571118 Grasp the target control with your right hand.
3571828 3573831 At your fingers is the weaponry,
3574032 3576707 - the lasers, photon bolts...<br />- Photon bolts and the particle beams.
3576807 3578616 Wait a minute.<br />This is just like back home!
3579050 3580450 - What's this?<br />- Careful, careful,
3580550 3583129 that's Death Blossom,<br />a weapon of last resort.
3583888 3586771 Luckily, I was in here working on it<br />when the hangar went up.
3587051 3588337 Now, are you ready?
3588588 3590476 All systems, go!
3592253 3593536 Ignition!
3597478 3599338 Wait a minute...<br />When did the hangar go up?
3599438 3600667 I told you,
3600868 3602425 when Xur attacked.
3602525 3603826 And where were the Starfighters?
3603926 3605026 In the hangar!
3605126 3606406 You mean they're dead?
3606800 3609400 Death is a primitive concept.
3609824 3612825 I prefer to think of them as<br />battling evil...
3613200 3614900 in another dimension.
3615004 3617456 In another dimension?<br />How many are left?
3617556 3618958 Including yourself?
3619266 3620468 Yeah!
3621769 3622862 One!
3624100 3625154 One?
3636400 3637403 Hold it.
3640509 3643317 There's no fleet,<br />no Starfighters, no plan?
3643457 3645818 - One ship, you, me, and that's it?<br />- Exactly!
3645918 3647026 Xur thinks you're still on Earth.
3647126 3649196 Classic military strategy.<br />Surprise attack.
3649296 3650449 It'll be a slaughter!
3650549 3651949 That's the spirit.
3652049 3653451 No, my slaughter.
3653551 3655353 One ship against the whole Armada?
3655453 3658273 Yes. One Gunstar against the Armada.
3658873 3661678 I've always wanted to fight<br />a desperate battle...
3661779 3663819 against incredible odds.
3666464 3667867 Target lights, Alex.
3667987 3669690 - Target lights?<br />- Yes.
3669791 3671506 You might want to squeeze off<br />a few rounds
3671606 3672611 while you have the chance.
3672711 3674511 Just work the bugs out of the system.
3674697 3676624 After all, it is her maiden voyage.
3698304 3700214 Steady.<br />Don't fight the chair.
3700514 3702475 Take your time.<br />Watch your gun sights.
3702575 3704051 Lead your targets.
3704351 3706377 And above all, relax!
3707271 3710383 Terrific. I'm about to get killed<br />a million miles from nowhere
3710483 3713386 with a gung-ho iguana<br />who tells me, "Relax."
3716555 3718157 Interstellar!
3750881 3752291 Alex!
3752808 3753860 Sorry.
3756595 3759595 Okay, now, come on.<br />Ease it up.
3761492 3762701 Okay.
3764453 3767253 Oh, that's... That's it. Easy.
3767523 3769326 Nice and easy. Yeah.
3770107 3773512 A little bit more<br />and we'll get it in there, now.
3774653 3775911 Alex!
3777533 3778587 Sorry.
3779108 3780314 Hi, Maggs.
3780504 3781787 Alex, are you all right?
3781887 3784290 Yeah. Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.
3785641 3788102 Come on. Let's try it again.
3789505 3791012 Did you smell anything?
3793150 3794233 Like what?
3794450 3795534 Like a Z...
3796509 3797543 Forget it.
3805801 3809603 I just wanted to say I'm sorry<br />for slapping you last night.
3810800 3813652 Oh, that's okay, Maggs.<br />I deserved it.
3813752 3814952 I'm sorry.
3815551 3819060 Well, maybe we can make it up to<br />each other tonight at Silver Lake?
3848938 3851382 The Armada will break<br />through the Frontier here,
3851482 3853564 and reach Rylos in 20 klicks.
3853950 3856750 Squadrons of deck fighters<br />will precede the mother ship.
3856851 3858707 Squadrons?<br />How many squadrons?
3858807 3861007 It isn't the number of squadrons<br />that concerns me.
3861108 3862908 It's this communication turret<br />that sends out
3863008 3864536 the commands to the deck fighters,
3864637 3866872 which enables them to act as one<br />during the fight.
3866972 3869525 Wait a second.<br />We knock out the turret to get the fighters.
3869625 3871831 But to get the turret,<br />we have to get through the fighters.
3872400 3873500 We're dead!
3873671 3876477 I'll have it all figured out<br />by the time we reach the Frontier.
3879625 3880726 What's that?
3881180 3882460 The Frontier.
3891200 3893400 That's strange.<br />What's a cargo ship
3893500 3895300 doing this close to the Frontier?
3896068 3898779 Hail.<br />This is Gunstar One.
3903502 3905411 I repeat, this is Gunstar One.
3905511 3907580 Identify yourself, please.
3909790 3910995 Alex, look out!
3914503 3915963 A Xurian ship!
3918582 3919884 Congratulations, Alex.
3919984 3922741 This is your first live target.
3922841 3923991 Live?
3927853 3930537 Within range in five klicks.<br />Get ready!
3935324 3936926 I've blocked its beam of frequency,
3937026 3938886 so it can't report back to the Armada.
3940487 3942341 - Fire when ready!<br />- Grig, wait!
3952124 3954629 We mustn't lose them in these caves, Alex!<br />Fire!
3978192 3979642 Shoot, Alex!
3984240 3987327 Shoot!
3994750 3995958 You did it!
4002867 4004083 I did it?
4004584 4005594 You did it!
4005694 4007201 You almost got me killed!
4010099 4012308 My deepest apologies, Alex.
4013018 4015419 I had hoped that by putting you<br />in the thick of battle,
4015520 4017720 a great Starfighter would emerge.
4018065 4020071 But, alas, perhaps...
4020862 4023445 there was never one within you<br />to begin with.
4025858 4027663 I shall take you home.
4029076 4032578 You still may live a long<br />and fruitful life back there.
4033320 4034572 That is,
4034773 4036827 until the Ko-Dan reach Earth.
4038002 4039202 But then again...
4054101 4057313 Hey, yo, Blake!<br />Make that sucker blast, man!
4057413 4060082 - You got it, dude!<br />- All right!
4066055 4068866 So Blake comes back in<br />to grab his pants, right?
4068966 4070601 Sees her old lady, and he says,
4070701 4073746 "I hope this doesn't rule out dinner<br />on Tuesday night."
4075501 4077082 That's my man!
4080909 4083564 Alex, are you okay?
4084715 4086925 Yeah, sure. Why?
4088010 4091210 I don't know.<br />You're just acting spaced out.
4091310 4092819 You're...<br />You're not yourself.
4094600 4097005 Well, if you were me,
4097846 4099980 what would you be doing right now?
4103282 4106285 Well, for one thing,<br />I'd be trying to enjoy myself.
4106945 4110749 Leaning back.<br />Kidding around. Laughing.
4110949 4112101 Laughing?
4112201 4114007 Well, it's a start, Alex.
4114453 4115738 Laughing...
4161141 4164002 Nice place.<br />Reminds me of home.
4164102 4165879 This reminds you of home?
4165979 4167989 Oh, yes.
4172819 4174837 I live below ground...
4175538 4177780 with my wifeoid and...
4177881 4179901 6,000 little Griglings.
4187100 4190503 At least,<br />until Xur turns them into slaves.
4195759 4197561 Where does your kind live?
4199100 4200600 Houses, mostly.
4201181 4203237 That's caves above ground.
4203638 4204920 See, here.
4205400 4206911 Here's my family.
4208772 4210174 See, that's...
4210857 4213374 That's my folks,<br />and my brother, Louis,
4213575 4215065 and that's Maggie.
4217155 4219183 Uh, we live in a mobile home.
4221034 4223653 That's a cave that goes places.
4223885 4226154 Only we never went any place.
4228502 4230791 A mobile cave that never went anywhere.
4231802 4233602 - Fascinating.<br />- Yeah,
4233706 4236216 but we have below-ground caves<br />near the trailer parks.
4236316 4239136 Me and my brother, Louis,<br />used to play hide-and-seek in 'em.
4241663 4243249 Hide-and-seek...
4243849 4244951 What is it, Alex?
4245051 4246251 Well, I was just thinking,
4246401 4248081 maybe we could hide here,
4248604 4250415 let the Armada pass by,
4250900 4253100 and then hit the turret from behind.
4253200 4255280 Then we might take them by surprise!
4260701 4262935 Your plan might really have worked.
4263085 4266689 What a pity there are no Starfighters left<br />to carry it out!
4267059 4268563 Yeah. Yeah.
4277402 4278957 A Xurian base!
4297604 4300232 Two more dead ahead!<br />Closing fast!
4324513 4327599 Earth course logged<br />into navigational beams.
4329393 4330477 Grig?
4332270 4333797 What is it, Alex?
4338777 4340779 Maybe there is a Starfighter left.
4389286 4390520 What's wrong?
4390650 4392455 Should I put my tongue in your ear now?
4392804 4394684 Don't bother, Alex.
4395000 4396068 Well, it's just...
4396168 4397976 I'm kind of new at these gland games.
4399504 4401406 What are you talking about?
4401506 4404068 It's like you're a million miles away, Alex!
4415086 4416890 Wait. Wait, Darling.
4417806 4420086 Darling, forgive me.
4429201 4431086 "Darling, forgive me."
4435350 4436735 Come on!
4437709 4439991 You're my Juliet. My Venus.
4444174 4445976 "You're my Juliet.
4446727 4448278 My Venus."
4451400 4452743 Alex!
4452891 4455351 All the other girls meant nothing to me.
4455477 4458688 It was you, you, you.
4458788 4460997 Shut up and talk dirty to me.
4462734 4464623 "The other girls meant nothing to me.
4464824 4468026 It was you, you, y..."
4469741 4471368 Should I talk dirty to you now?
4472627 4473854 That does it.
4474604 4475629 God.
4475880 4477455 All right. I give up.
4477582 4479084 I'm not Alex Rogan.
4479284 4480369 What?
4480669 4481878 I'm a beta unit.
4481978 4483379 I'm an exact duplicate of Alex.
4483480 4484740 See, he's up there saving the universe,
4484841 4486524 while I'm down here for target practice.
4489277 4490278 See?
4499281 4501383 Alex! Or whatever you are.<br />Wait. Wait.
4501483 4502487 What are you do...<br />Let me go.
4502587 4504491 If that Zando-Zan reports back<br />that I'm not Alex,
4504602 4505640 Alex is in big trouble!
4505740 4507045 - You're staying here.<br />- No, I'm not.
4507145 4508148 I'm not staying anywhere...
4508249 4509933 - until I find out what's going on!<br />- Oh, God!
4512092 4513382 Hey, my truck!
4513583 4515196 Hey, hey, come back!
4517222 4519516 Scratch that paint,<br />and you're dead, Rogan!
4529804 4532404 - Ready to invade, Commander.<br />- Invade.
4532504 4535573 Commander, the Xurian ships have<br />not answered our invasion code.
4535673 4538034 The Frontier is down,<br />the moon is eclipsed,
4538134 4540334 the Starfighters are dead.<br />Invade!
4541287 4543798 All squadrons ahead, half speed,
4543899 4545596 with energy probes on.
4575880 4576896 Energy probe.
4576997 4578616 Shut down, Alex. Shut down.
4580050 4581204 Power off.
4598027 4599030 Alex?
4599131 4600581 In space?
4602900 4604400 - Is this for real?<br />- Yes!
4604500 4605670 That's what I'm trying to tell you!
4605770 4606870 It's all for real!
4606970 4608774 Well, then, don't talk.<br />Drive!
4621718 4624829 Commander Kril, we're getting a signal<br />on the alert frequency.
4625029 4626306 Acknowledge.
4629800 4631400 There it is. All right.
4631500 4633600 When I give the signal,<br />we're gonna jump! Okay?
4633700 4635415 - What do you mean, "Jump" ?<br />- We're gonna ram him.
4635515 4636516 What?
4637442 4640242 Extermination Emissary Zeta 6,<br />one message.
4640342 4641344 Ready?
4641813 4643413 - Jump!<br />- Alex!
4645116 4647396 "The last Starfighter..."
4649100 4650900 You owe me one, Alex.
4657455 4658913 Alex!
4661252 4663458 Transmission pulsars<br />have stopped, Commander.
4663568 4665786 The last Starfighter...
4665886 4667175 ls dead!
4668250 4670756 The last Starfighter is dead!
4671502 4673182 Nothing can stop us now.
4673402 4674402 Ahead full.
4674555 4675814 To Rylos!
4696267 4697669 The command ship!
4702607 4705208 There!<br />The turret at the far end!
4706949 4708151 I see it.
4711250 4712937 Good luck, Starfighter.
4713500 4714703 Thanks, Grig,
4715080 4716280 for everything.
4729298 4731185 I love you, Alex Rogan.

4749000 4750201 Let's do it.
4761400 4763005 Tracking alert.
4766100 4768784 Unidentified craft.<br />What is it?
4773540 4774940 Wait.
4775287 4776767 Gunstar!
4777058 4781560 So, the last Starfighter is dead?
4782280 4784280 This has gone far enough.
4784401 4785608 Seize him!
4786601 4787801 How dare you?
4788002 4790141 I am the Emperor of Rylos!
4790311 4793114 I and I alone command this entire op...
4793414 4795641 Release me! I command you!
4795941 4798636 You will pay for this with your lives!
4799136 4802214 - Wait!<br />- All guns, fire!
4811550 4813059 There it is, the turret!
4813751 4815211 Alex, now!
4817318 4818322 Yes!
4818422 4819465 Got it!
4821092 4822400 Hurry, Alex! Fire!
4822501 4824203 The Armada's almost to Rylos!
4844173 4846492 Escape pod activated.
4848160 4850165 Escape pod ignition.
4850955 4852923 The Gunstar is gone from our sensors.
4853023 4854717 Alert wing commanders.
4855334 4857586 Communication turret is destroyed.
4862617 4866062 All communication radar systems<br />are out, Wing Commander.
4866804 4869404 Proceed with a visual attack formation.
4873209 4874715 Life support good.
4875526 4877131 Ammo packs at peak.
4877373 4878966 I think we've got to use Death Blossom.
4879066 4880635 Remember,<br />Death Blossom delivers
4880735 4883017 only one massive volley at close range.
4883738 4885039 Theoretically.
4885239 4886599 What do you mean, "Theoretically" ?
4886699 4888868 After all, D. B. has never been tested.
4888968 4890492 It might overload the systems.
4890592 4891592 Blow up the ship.
4891692 4892692 What are you worried about, Grig?
4892792 4894672 Theoretically,<br />we should already be dead.
4896709 4899262 Open Death Blossom petals.<br />Switch is on.
4914000 4916570 Do not trigger D. B. until we're within range.
4916671 4918982 Just use your lasers until I give the signal.
4919482 4920508 Remember to lead...
4920608 4922009 I've been recruited by the Star League
4922109 4923761 to defend the Frontier.
4923861 4924887 Now, are you ready?
4924987 4927615 This is it. Here we go.
4927740 4929540 Charge!
4958800 4960001 On your right!
4961941 4963141 Your left!
4964658 4965865 Evade!
4969780 4970980 Power packs are low!
4971080 4972580 We need time to recharge!
4974500 4976385 Laser power draining!
4984880 4986386 Grig, my weapons are gone!
4987387 4989118 - Should I do it?<br />- Easy, easy...
4989218 4991423 Wait till they're all in Death Blossom range!
5000651 5001851 Fire!
5035472 5036758 We did it.
5037683 5039970 Yes, we actually did, didn't we?
5043454 5044964 The command ship!
5045649 5047051 Commander, our guns are out.
5047151 5048761 Damage control is repairing them.
5048861 5050342 Forget the guns!
5050743 5052323 Ramming speed!
5061085 5062291 Grig, we need power!
5062391 5064226 Death Blossom's drained all power.
5064335 5065785 I'm working on it.
5065936 5068047 I'm trying to... to run boost.
5071508 5074345 All we have left is life support power!
5081000 5082100 Grig!
5088425 5089830 All right!
5097501 5099501 Weapons on! We have them now!
5099610 5101415 Fire. Fire!
5124244 5125870 Damage report!
5126522 5128026 Guidance system out.
5128387 5130267 Auxiliary steering out.
5130367 5131727 Divert!
5132686 5134004 Divert!
5134104 5135306 She won't answer the helm!
5135406 5137766 We're locked into the moon's<br />gravitational pull!
5138006 5139210 What do we do?
5143287 5144691 We die.
5165753 5169298 On behalf of the Star League<br />and all citizens of Rylos,
5169398 5172551 I congratulate you on your dazzling victory.
5172651 5174219 - Thank you.<br />- Thanks.
5174319 5177781 But as you know,<br />the Frontier is down,
5177881 5180284 Xur escaped,<br />and there is still danger.
5180384 5183395 So I was wondering<br />if you wouldn't be willing to stay on,
5183495 5185895 and rebuild the Starfighter Legion.
5186000 5187243 Wait a minute.
5188375 5190044 Rebuild the Legion?
5190164 5191420 Yes.
5191854 5195332 Of course, you'd have the help<br />of an old friend.
5196300 5197702 An old friend? Who?
5214234 5215454 Centauri!
5215800 5217040 I thought you were dead!
5217234 5219634 Me die and miss all the excitement?
5219735 5220735 Oh, no.
5220835 5223335 I was merely dormant<br />while my body repaired itself.
5223435 5225385 Now, I won't bore you with details.
5225485 5228263 Suffice it to say,<br />you're on Rylos, my boy.
5228368 5229868 Stop thinking human.
5230008 5231365 That's lesson number one.
5231515 5232781 Now, lesson number two,
5233082 5234882 you've got a good thing going here.
5234982 5237385 Keep smiling.<br />Don't blow it.
5237774 5239269 Lesson number three,
5239570 5241603 always trust Centauri.
5246448 5248335 Alex, they love you!
5252251 5255535 You see, all Rylos is behind you.
5256852 5258420 You've got to stay, Alex!
5258520 5260464 You will stay, won't you?
5260564 5262392 Of course, he'll stay.
5263307 5265527 That's very reassuring, Centauri.
5265627 5268130 Grig, I leave it in your capable hands.
5269882 5270991 I'll stay.
5284081 5285370 Alex!
5286121 5287407 Alex!
5300800 5301818 Greetings...
5303690 5305192 Greetings, Starfighter.
5305542 5306902 Bunny, have you seen Alex?
5307002 5308308 Can't say that I have.
5308408 5309809 Well, ask Maggie.
5310400 5311705 She knows where he is.
5311805 5313057 She was with him.
5313707 5315077 Maggie, where's Alex?
5315177 5317586 Yeah, where's my truck?<br />Where's your boyfriend?
5317800 5320808 Mrs. Rogan, about Alex,<br />you see, he's...
5323727 5324930 - What's going on?<br />- What is it?
5325031 5326214 I don't know.
5348251 5349836 Oh, my God!
5352800 5355200 All right!<br />We're being invaded!
5382609 5383612 Maggie.
5385000 5386085 Maggie.
5449501 5450687 Alex?
5450814 5452022 Hi, Maggs.
5453023 5454190 Alex,
5456260 5457260 is it you?
5457360 5458441 I mean,
5458682 5460362 is it really you?
5465200 5466205 Look!
5468000 5469300 My God!
5470081 5471374 It is you.
5471958 5474402 It's Alex! Alex!
5474502 5476129 Alex, what is going on here?
5476229 5477689 What is this thing?
5485496 5487499 I mean, is this your spaceship?
5487699 5489267 - I don't know what's gotten into him.<br />- It's a...
5489392 5491086 I don't understand that.
5491186 5492629 It's so strange!
5492729 5494230 Wait. Hold it.<br />Hold it, everybody.
5494330 5497233 Alex, what is all this?
5499736 5501763 I've been to another planet, Ma.
5501863 5503147 Another planet?
5504215 5506426 Who was it helped fix my antenna?
5506526 5508553 - Yeah, who stole my truck?<br />- And cut my electric?
5508653 5510580 And ruined my stove?
5510680 5512916 Oh, that was...<br />That was a beta unit.
5513016 5514042 Beta unit?
5514142 5515185 A robot.
5515285 5516693 A robot? What the...
5516793 5517996 Come on!
5518296 5519739 A monster!
5523305 5524808 A monster!
5525028 5526828 He got them chains on him.
5527113 5529099 All right! It's an alien!
5529199 5530784 Oh, no, no, wait!<br />Hey, hey!
5530884 5532769 Granny, put away that shotgun.<br />What's wrong with you?
5532869 5534370 - This is my friend Grig.<br />- Friend?
5534470 5536673 - I want you all to meet my friend here.<br />- You got to be kidding!
5536773 5539250 Grig, this is Mrs. Boone.
5540892 5542693 - Hello.<br />- Hello.
5543200 5544700 And this is Elvira.
5544800 5546009 - Delighted.<br />- Me, too.
5546144 5548201 - How you doing?<br />- I do well.
5548301 5549577 And this is Granny.
5549677 5550945 How do you do?
5551095 5552531 How do you do?
5552831 5554284 And this here's Otis.
5554474 5555674 A pleasure.
5555954 5557964 Any friend of Alex...
5559395 5561231 And... this is Maggie.
5562258 5564139 A very large pleasure.
5565000 5566068 Hi.
5570415 5572302 You must be Louis!
5575145 5577531 I hear good things about you.
5577631 5579135 Hear that, you slimes?
5579236 5580443 I'm famous.
5582800 5585258 And this is my Mom.
5588158 5590962 You should be proud of Alex, Mrs. Rogan.
5591400 5592800 You must all be proud of him.
5592900 5596700 He saved the Star League and<br />hundreds of worlds, including Earth.
5596808 5598601 Oh, for heaven's sake!
5598768 5600603 Oh, my God!
5602207 5604014 Time to leave, Alex.
5604424 5605675 Alex?
5606276 5607427 I have to, Ma.
5607527 5608970 They need me up there.
5609070 5611806 Oh, Alex, I always knew<br />you'd leave someday, but...
5611906 5613583 I never expected this.
5613683 5615887 Gee, can I go, too, Alex?<br />Can I?
5615987 5617024 Sorry, squirt.
5617225 5620083 There's only enough room up there<br />for me, Grig,
5620204 5621488 and Maggie.
5623006 5624694 - Me?<br />- Yeah.
5626237 5629316 - Alex, I don't think I can...<br />- What?
5629517 5631118 Come here. Come here.
5631800 5634300 - Why else do you think I came back?<br />- Well...
5634400 5636204 Didn't we say we'd always be together?
5636831 5640336 Well, yeah, I mean,<br />together here or in the city.
5640977 5642629 But... But up there, Alex...
5642729 5644129 Maggs, you got to come.<br />You see, I'm not...
5644230 5646030 I don't know when I'm gonna be back.
5647200 5649100 Don't you see? This is it.<br />This is our big chance.
5649200 5651078 It's like what Otis says,
5651613 5653223 when it comes, you got to grab on
5653323 5654833 with both hands and hold tight.
5658000 5659900 Well, what about Granny, Alex?
5665301 5668384 You're right.<br />I'm scared of leaving here.
5669405 5670914 Why can't you just stay?
5671074 5672902 Maggie, I have to leave,
5673003 5674889 and I want you to come with me.
5678501 5679957 Alex!
5680358 5681607 Hurry!
5684406 5685974 Well, I got to go.
5690857 5691965 Bye.
5695849 5698354 Alex, we can't hold off<br />their radar any longer.
5698455 5700364 Yeah, okay.<br />I got to go, Ma.
5701145 5702464 - Bye. Take it easy.<br />- Bye, darling.
5702564 5703964 So long. So long, everybody.
5704107 5705175 Bye, Alex!
5705275 5706609 - Bye!<br />- Bye!
5706709 5709129 - Bye, Alex.<br />- Bye, Alex!
5709529 5711029 Goodbye, Alex!
5719856 5721124 Alex!
5722400 5723693 Granny...
5724920 5726120 Be sure and write,
5726220 5728420 or whatever it is they do up there.
5733536 5735805 Alex! Wait, Alex!
5754198 5755433 Get back! Come on!
5755533 5756726 - Get back!<br />- Bye!
5756826 5758326 - Keep your distance!<br />- Watch what you're doing.
5758426 5760313 - Keep your distance, now.<br />- Otis! Mom!
5760413 5762822 This baby really packs a punch!
5763791 5765084 Bye.
5765658 5766663 Bye.
5766763 5769272 Look at him!<br />Bye!
5769539 5770673 Bye.
5773635 5776687 Oh, go on.<br />They're gonna be happy up there!
5776888 5778364 So long, Alex!
5780083 5781509 So long, Alex!
5785188 5786889 We're gonna be famous, aren't we, Otis?
