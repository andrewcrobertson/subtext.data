630495 633555 Oh, sure. I love patching 30-year-old fuse panels...
633664 636565 and plunging people�s toilets.
636667 639363 Otis, l-I never even get a chance<br />to have a good time around here.
641272 645208 Things change.<br />Always do.
648179 650170 You�ll get your chance!
650214 652614 Important thing is, when it comes...

1018682 1020673 - �Night.<br />- �Night.
1038135 1042401 Someday they�re gonna say,<br />��This is where it all began. ��
1044008 1047603 - What?<br />- Mom, I finally broke the Starfighter record.
1047711 1052944 - Oh, that�s nice, dear.<br />- Nice? It�s stupendous!
1053017 1055577 Uh, Alex...
1055619 1058611 Mr. Brenner knew that you�d want<br />to see this as soon as possible...
1058656 1060920 so he brought it by the diner and, uh...
1060958 1063927 Well, I was so excited, l-I opened it.
1063961 1067419 - Oh, that�s okay. What is it?<br />- It�s about your loan.
1073637 1078438 You can... still go to City College<br />with your friends.
1117414 1119348 Greetings, Starfighter.
1123854 1127813 Greetings, Starfighter. You have been recruited<br />by the Star League to defend the frontier.
1127858 1130520 - You have been recruited...<br />Greetings, Starfighter.
1130561 1132825 You have been recruited...
1132863 1135354 You have been recruited...
1135432 1137457 You have been recruited...
1140037 1144269 Get ready.<br />Prepare for blastoff.
1186617 1189415 Hello. Excuse me, son.
1191121 1194557 - Store�s closed, mister.<br />I'm not here for cigarettes or bubble gum, my boy
1194625 1198254 Can you tell me the name of the person who broke<br />the record on that game over there?
1198362 1200330 Where I might find him?
1201765 1205166 Alex Rogan.<br />You�re lookin� at him.
1205235 1208864 Alex Rogan. Aha-ha.
1208939 1210873 - Who are you?<br />- Centauri�s the name.
1210974 1214808 - I invented Starfighter, which is why I'm here.<br />- It is?
1214845 1218144 It is. We have to talk about a matter of<br />utmost importance. Step into my office.
1219483 1222543 That�s it.<br />Come on now.
1222653 1225645 Nothing to be afraid of.
1229093 1232756 Oh, yes. Say hello to my assistant, Beta.
1232863 1235764 - Howdy.
1235866 1240803 - Ow!<br />- I must congratulate you on<br />your virtuoso performance.
1240871 1243669 Centauri is impressed.<br />I've seen �em come and I've seen �em go.
1243774 1245799 But you�re the best, my boy.<br />Dazzling.
1245876 1248470 Light years ahead of the competition.
1248579 1250479 Which is why Centauri is here.
1250581 1254574 He�s got a little proposition for you.<br />Are ya interested?
1256520 1258488 - I guess.
1258589 1262855 - Hey!
1266330 1271233 - What are you doing?<br />- Listen. Centauri wants to keep it for a surprise.
1271335 1275135 Trust me. Oh, ho-ho-ho,<br />you�re gonna love it. Love it!
1280043 1284742 The amusing thing about this: It�s all a big mistake.
1284848 1287783 That particular Starfighter game was<br />supposed to be delivered to Vegas...
1287885 1292345 not some flea-speck trailer park in the<br />middle of tumbleweeds and tarantulas.
1292456 1294447 So it must be fate, destiny...
1294558 1297891 blind chance, luck even, that brings us together.
1297961 1301453 And as the poet says, ��The rest is history. ��
1310674 1314075 Where are you going?<br />Where are you taking me?
1314111 1316204 I told you.<br />I wanna save it for a surprise.
1316313 1321842 Hey. Are you the kind of kid who reads<br />the last page of a mystery first?
1321919 1324183 Who pesters the magician to tell you his tricks?
1324221 1327019 Who sneaks downstairs to peek<br />at his Christmas presents?
1327057 1329218 No. Of course you�re not!
1329326 1333023 That�s why<br />~ I'm not gonna tell you ~
1333130 1335963 Oh, God.
1336033 1339730 Besides, I just love surprises, don�t you?
1339837 1342032 Hey, look out!
1342139 1344733 - Stop! - Oh, dear!<br />- Hit the brakes!

1849012 1853312 Attention.<br />Attention please.<br />Ambassador Enduran has arrived...
1853383 1857479 and will now address<br />Starfighter Command personnel.
1859723 1864626 - As you all know, we have been on a desperate<br />quest... - Excuse me. Excuse me.
1864728 1867720 - To find Starfighters and navigators
1870867 1874735 I should... I should<br />crush you to gorun dust!
1874771 1876932 I'm sorry, uh-uh...<br />It was an accident.
1876973 1881239 L-l-I didn�t mean to step on your,<br />uh... whatever that is.
1881344 1884575 - Hideous creature.<br />- If I may continue.
1884647 1889949 - Our forces have...<br />- You don�t trifle with a Bogati. They love to fight.
1889986 1892352 That�s why they�re perfect for this war.
1894090 1896285 - Did you say ��war��?<br />- But of course!
1896359 1898327 Why else do you think you�re here?
1898361 1900761 You were recruited by the Star League to defend...
1900864 1904595 ��... to defend the frontier against Xur<br />and the Kodan Armada. ��
1904667 1906601 Oy, vey.
1906669 1912369 Eons ago, our ancestors<br />created our great frontier...
1912475 1917879 a barrier of energy encircling<br />the peaceful systems of the universe.
1917914 1922908 And forever shutting out<br />the scourge that lurks beyond.
1924554 1929514 Fellow Rylans, because of a dark betrayal...
1929626 1932618 - our frontier will soon collapse.
1934330 1939324 So we turn to you, Starfighters<br />and your navigators.
1939436 1943065 For of all the billions<br />of creatures in the Star League...
1943139 1948839 only you few were found to possess the, uh...
1948945 1950970 gift.
1951047 1954278 You, and you alone...
1954384 1958844 stand between us and<br />the black terror of the Kodan.
1958955 1964393 - Victory or death!<br />- Victory or death!
1964494 1967361 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1967397 1970298 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1970366 1973460 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1973570 1975868 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1975905 1978703 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1978808 1981902 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1981945 1985108 Victory or death!<br />Victory or death!
1985215 1988446 Now, Starfighters, if you will<br />reach underneath your seats...
1988551 1992954 - you will find a packet which<br />contains one hand trans...
1996025 2000189 This is a restricted area off-limits to...
2000230 2004360 My apologies, Starfighter.
2004467 2008028 Star Navigator First Class Grig<br />at your service, sir!
2010874 2015334 Hi. I'm Alex Rogan. I was playing this game<br />back home, and this guy came up to me.
2015378 2017346 Only he�s not a guy.<br />He�s an alien, right?
2017447 2020177 And I get into his car.<br />Only it�s not a car. It�s a spaceship.
2020283 2023582 And, uh...<br />There�s been a big mistake.
2023653 2027851 Am I to understand you�re actually declining<br />the honor of becoming a Starfighter?
2027957 2031791 - You got it.<br />- Extraordinary!
2031861 2035957 For eons, all creatures have<br />dreamt of being Starfighters.
2036065 2038090 - Where you from?<br />- Earth.
2038201 2041466 And we�re not at war with anybody<br />except each other.
2041571 2045029 Earth? Earth isn�t a formal member<br />of the Star League...
2045141 2047609 and isn�t due to be approached<br />until it matures.
2047644 2050511 This is all highly irregular.
2050547 2052811 Tell me.<br />Who recruited you?
2052916 2054850 Centauri.
2054951 2059752 - There he is. That�s him!<br />- Centauri. I might have known.
2059822 2062916 ~ Di-aye-diliddle-di-di<br />Dum, dum, diliddli... ~
2062959 2066759 Up to your old Excalibur tricks<br />again, eh, Centauri?
2066829 2069389 Did it ever occur to you<br />that it is against the law...
2069465 2072127 to recruit from worlds<br />outside the Star League?
2072235 2076729 Earth �s in danger too, isn�t it? And,<br />no, I didn�t use the Excalibur test.
2076773 2079936 It was called a video game.<br />What�s all the brouhaha?
2080043 2082739 After all, he does have the gift!
2082779 2087910 This may come as bit of a shock to you,<br />but he doesn�t want to be a Starfighter.
2088051 2091543 Doesn�t want to be a...<br />Are you a coward?
2091654 2094145 - Are you crazy?<br />- You didn�t tell me about any of this!
2094257 2096885 Return the money, Centauri!
2096993 2100360 Return the money?<br />Are you delirious?
2100463 2103591 You know how long it took to invent<br />the games, to merchandise them...
2103633 2106796 to get �em into the stores by Christmas?
2106903 2110839 It must be terribly embarrassing<br />for you, and I do sympathize. However...
2110907 2114343 But I saw him fight! He could be<br />the greatest Starfighter ever!
2114410 2118210 - That was a game, Centauri.<br />- A game?
2118247 2121512 You may have thought it was a game,<br />but it was also a test.
2121551 2125487 Aha! A test! Sent out across<br />the universe to find those...
2125521 2127819 with the gift to be Starfighters.
2127890 2130950 And here you are, my boy.<br />Here you are!
2131027 2135327 - Right! Here I am, about to be killed!<br />- Killed.
2135365 2138232 You don�t seriously think it�s<br />dangerous, do you?
2138334 2143465 - Don�t be silly! Trust me!
2159255 2161655 Xur!
2161724 2163624 Xur!
2163693 2166491 Xur?
2166596 2169588 Yes, Father, your mighty frontier...
2169699 2172600 grows weaker by the moment.
2172702 2176331 Do not call me father!
2176439 2178839 You are no longer my son!
2178908 2182605 You�re an outcast!<br />Why have you returned?
2182712 2185203 I have returned for the good of all Rylans.
2185314 2188715 With an armada of Kodan<br />warships behind you?
2188751 2192312 There are some Rylans<br />who would welcome me, Father.
2192422 2196415 Star League justice put<br />down your Xurian cult.
2196526 2201259 - Your followers are few and scattered.<br />- Star League?
2201364 2204333 A refuge for weak worlds<br />not worthy to be our equals!
2204434 2207369 That is for the Rylans to decide...
2207437 2211533 and not for a dangerous and evil child<br />such as yourself.
2211574 2214873 And yet it is this child...
2214977 2218640 who caught your master spy.
2246542 2250638 Hear me, Rylans!
2250713 2253944 When the green moon of Galan is eclipsed...
2254016 2257110 Kodan armada will invade.
2257153 2262147 And not even your mighty Starfighters<br />will be able to save you.
2262258 2264658 We shall see, Xur.
2264761 2266820 We shall see!
2277540 2280737 You still want to go?
2280843 2282708 And miss all the excitement?
2288484 2290816 Little brat. I invent<br />the game, find the kid...
2290887 2293685 drag him up there, and he<br />doesn�t want to be a Starfighter.
2293790 2297317 I give up!
2332528 2334519 Control, do you copy<br />our star angle difference...
2334630 2337622 from parking angle?
2337733 2342500 Delta beta two at six,<br />delta gamma three at five.
2347410 2350607 Emperor Xur ordered me<br />to bring his scepter.
2352381 2354474 Let him enter.
2354584 2357018 Target vector remains on scope.
2371200 2374692 Just like your Kodan emperor�s,<br />isn�t it, Commander Kril?
2374804 2379207 It takes more than<br />a scepter to rule, Xur...
2379308 2381503 even on Rylos.
2384213 2387011 You�re right, Kril.
2387116 2391815 It does take more than a scepter.
2398327 2402229 How long must we endure this fool?
2402265 2407430 - We have a break in the frontier.<br />- Fire the meteor gun!
2408771 2412229 My dear Kodan friends!<br />Lest we forget...
2412341 2416937 it was your own emperor who<br />granted me command of this armada.
2417046 2420538 For only I hold the secret to the frontier.
2420650 2423346 Only I know the location<br />of the Starfighter base.
2423386 2427652 And therefore, only I will<br />give the order to fire!
2431060 2433153 Forgive me, Xur.
2439502 2442665 You are forgiven, Commander Kril.
2445508 2449103 Meteor gunner... fire.
2481577 2483568 Sergeant!
2485982 2488974 I have an unidentified<br />incoming object in Sector 31, sir.
2493756 2497692 They�re headed for the base!<br />Alert! We are under attack!
2497760 2499887 I repeat:<br />We are under attack!
2501263 2503857 Activate automatic repulser guns.
2557186 2561054 Condition Red! Condition Red!
2570166 2573397 At last it is done!
2573469 2577872 Soon the frontier will be down<br />and they will bow to their new emperor!
2577907 2580899 Or I will darken the sky<br />with their ashes.
2580976 2584002 Commander, the Xurian spy reports that<br />one Starfighter has escaped.
2584113 2588447 Escaped?
2599462 2601362 You sure I can�t give you a hand?
2601464 2606128 - You�ve done quite enough already. Thank you.<br />- Well, uh...
2606235 2610171 It�s only a few more miles from here.<br />I guess... I guess I can walk it.
2610239 2613367 So long!<br />Bye, Centauri!
2625654 2628589 Oh, Alex!
2628691 2631057 Here!
2635064 2637055 Hey, listen. I can�t take<br />a present from you, Centauri.
2637166 2641660 Oh, ho-ho-ho... He reduces me to poverty<br />again and he thinks I'm giving him a present.
2641704 2643899 - What a world this is.<br />- What is it, then?
2644006 2645997 It�s a second chance, my boy!
2646108 2649407 If you change your mind,<br />just tap the communo-crystals.
2653749 2656309 - Keep it.<br />- Ahh, Alex, Alex!
2656418 2659546 You�re walking away<br />from history. History!
2659655 2663056 Did Chris Columbus say<br />he wanted to stay home? No!
2663159 2665753 What if the Wright Brothers<br />thought that only birds should fly?
2665861 2670924 - And did Geloca think the Yulus were too<br />ugly to save? - Who�s Geloca?
2672935 2675529 Never mind.
2675571 2677539 Listen, Centauri.<br />I'm not any of those guys.
2677640 2680541 - I'm a kid from a trailer park.<br />- If that�s what you think...
2680643 2684238 then that�s all you�ll ever be!
2713342 2716038 Hey, Maggie!
2716145 2718511 Listen to me. You�re not<br />going to believe this.
2718614 2721310 I told you, Alex. Me and my...<br />how did you put it...
2721417 2725649 strange sexual urges<br />aren�t talking to you anymore.
2765928 2769989 - Who�s there!<br />- Shh! You�re gonna wake up Louis.
2778207 2783008 - Hey, you look like me!<br />- �Course I do. I'm the beta unit.
2783112 2788914 - What the helI's a beta unit?<br />- A beta unit is a simuloid...
2789018 2792146 an exact duplicate of you,<br />only not as loud.
2792221 2796817 - Huh?<br />- I was in the starcar, remember?<br />We shook hands?
2796859 2800351 I became you... unfortunately.
2800462 2806128 - Let me get this straight. You�re a robot?<br />- I beg your pardon.
2806235 2809534 I'm a state-of-the-art,<br />top-of-the-line beta unit...
2809638 2812937 put here as a courtesy replacement<br />for while you�re away.
2812975 2815466 Lucky me.
2815577 2819536 - What are you doing back?<br />- Are you kidding? It�s war up there!
2819581 2823381 Oh. Save the whales and not the universe, huh?
2823419 2825478 Well, why don�t you go up there and fight?
2825521 2828217 Simuloids can�t fight.<br />We�re not allowed.
2828324 2831782 - Well, tell �em that you�re me! Pretend!<br />- Be quiet, Alex.
2831894 2835330 - Sorry, Louis.<br />- Sorry, Louis.
2835431 2839197 - Thanks for the lift!<br />- See you around!
2860556 2862717 Greetings, Starfighter.
2862758 2867752 You have been recruited by the Star League<br />to defend the frontier against Xur and...
2888584 2891610 - And, hey, what did you do to Maggie?<br />- Do to her?
2891720 2895918 We�re sittin� outside lookin� at the stars<br />and she sticks her tongue in my ear.
2896024 2898788 I screamed.<br />I'll apologize tomorrow, okay?
2898894 2902022 You�re not gonna be here. You�re<br />goin� back with Centauri right now!
2902097 2905589 - What�s up, Alex?<br />- Back to sleep or I'm tellin�<br />Ma about your Playboys.
2907803 2910294 - You�re blowin� it, Alex!
2915411 2918608 - What the shit?<br />- I said, back to sleep, Louis...
2918647 2922014 or I'm tellin� Ma about your Playboys!
2922050 2924848 Come in, Centauri.
2924953 2927922 Come on. Get back here.<br />And take your Tonka toy with ya.
2928023 2930719 Greetings, Starfighter!
2930826 2934262 You have been recruited by the Star<br />League to defend the frontier against...
2934329 2937423 Xur and the Kodan armada.
2937533 2939467 Gree... Greetings, Starfighter!
2939535 2943869 You have been recruited by the Star League<br />to defend the-the frontier against Xur...
2948177 2950475 Where are ya?<br />Come on, where are ya?
2950579 2953013 Centauri?
2953115 2956084 Greetings, Starfighter!
2956185 2958085 Centauri?
3019448 3021348 Oh, shit!
3021450 3023850 Come on, Alex.<br />Don�t be such a wimp!
3040569 3042469 - Centauri, look out!<br />- What the...
3069932 3075234 Whew! Foul stench!<br />Dirty creatures.
3078240 3080367 Get a good look, Alex.
3080442 3083172 You can bet your asteroids<br />you�ll be seeing more of them.
3083245 3086442 - What?<br />- This is a Zando-Zan.
3086548 3090040 An interstellar hitbeast,<br />compliments of Xur.
3090085 3092679 Xur? Why is he after me?
3092754 3094688 Somehow he found out you�re a Starfighter.
3094790 3098453 So you see, Alex,<br />you gotta go back. You got no choice.
3098560 3100755 �Cause if you stay<br />down here, you�re dog meat.
3100862 3103660 Trust Centauri, my boy.<br />Because in two hours...
3103699 3106463 this place will be crawling<br />with ten Zando-Zans...
3106568 3110470 with just one thought on their<br />microscopic little minds:
3110572 3114167 - Kill Alex Rogan.<br />- Kill Alex Rogan.
3114276 3118269 He�s right, Alex. At least up there<br />you�ll have a fighting chance in a Gunstar.
3118380 3121747 Exactly. Meanwhile, down here,<br />they�ll be going after Beta.
3121850 3124819 - Beta. - Beta?<br />- Of course.
3124853 3126821 What do you think he�s here for?
3126855 3128823 Wait a...<br />Wait a second here, Centauri.
3128857 3130825 Alex, look out!
3137366 3140335 Centauri!
3140369 3145033 - Beta, get a doctor!<br />- No. No native cures. No witch doctors.
3145073 3147132 I'm fine.<br />Just a scratch.
3148944 3154041 Now face it, Alex.<br />You�re a born Starfighter.
3155884 3158478 Are you with me?
3166895 3170854 Okay, let�s go, Centauri.
3171900 3174061 Good luck, Alex.
3175904 3179067 You too, Alex.
3200128 3203859 Centauri to Starfighter Command.
3203932 3208733 Centauri to Starfighter Command.<br />Come in, please.
3223485 3225385 Hey, Centauri.
3229357 3234158 All personnel.<br />Starcar is approaching Docking Gate 12.
3234262 3238392 Centauri! Centauri!
3242104 3244402 Hey, hit the brakes!
3249511 3251536 - Grig! Hey, Grig!<br />- Alex!
3251646 3253637 They got Centauri.<br />He�s hurt!
3253715 3255706 He�s right over here.
3266661 3269960 Ah, you see?
3270065 3274627 - Centauri brought him back!<br />- Yes, I see. Don�t talk.
3274669 3279572 - Does he have my money, Alex?<br />- I have a fortune for you, Centauri.
3279641 3282872 - Now, please be still.
3282944 3285936 It�s here. It�s all here.<br />Piles and piles of it.
3286047 3288948 All for you.
3289050 3291848 Ah.
3291887 3295345 At last.
3295390 3298757 Alex, I want you know...
3298860 3301727 it was for the greatest good<br />I brought you back.
3303598 3307728 �Course, it-it...
3307803 3313139 It never hurts to be rich.
3319948 3324851 Until the next dimension, old friend.
3326221 3328519 I'm sorry, Alex.
3328557 3330525 Centauri?
3335964 3338558 Centauri?
3338667 3342728 The frontier could collapse at any moment.
3342838 3345830 Alex!
3400128 3402596 Now I need an ear job.
3402631 3405225 Dyin� here. Dyin�.
3419247 3422273 Alex, what the helI's goin� on?
3422384 3427788 Louis, you�re having a terrible<br />nightmare. Go back to sleep.
3432093 3434288 Louis!
3447842 3449833 Oh, no.
3459521 3462354 Am I to understand there�s a beta unit<br />taking your place back home?
3462457 3465051 - He�s trying.<br />- So it�s safe to assume...
3465160 3467128 that Xur thinks you�re still on Earth.
3467228 3469662 Yeah.
3469731 3472427 That could work to our advantage...<br />theoretically.
3478440 3482069 Ah!<br />Now you look human!
3483878 3487712 - Is this my Gunstar?<br />- This is a prototype... different<br />from the other ships.
3487816 3492082 She has a greater range, more power,<br />and a slight weapons modification.
3492187 3494587 And of course, she�s got deflective plating...
3494689 3497624 so she can withstand several direct hits.
3500895 3503193 - From here...
3503298 3507496 this is where I navigate the ship, maintain<br />life support and propulsion systems.
3508703 3510603 Okay. Where do I sit?
3510705 3513435 - Way up there, in the gunnery chair.
3516211 3519806 - Hang on!<br />- Okay.
3524052 3527715 Now, climb into the gunnery chair.
3527756 3533126 Now, I'm moving you into launch position.
3533228 3537221 There in front of you are the two switches<br />for your heads-up display. Turn them on.
3541870 3546307 While you�re engaging the enemy, the screen will<br />reflect all battle instruments toward you.
3548977 3552071 - Hey, where did it go?<br />- It�s still there, suspended in a Xenon mist.
3552113 3556573 - But it�s only visible if you look dead ahead.<br />- Ah. Got it.
3556618 3559086 The lever on your left is the chair controller.
3559120 3561714 As you can see, all guns<br />will track with your every move.
3569798 3572392 Grasp the target control<br />with your right hand.
3572434 3576336 At your fingers is the weaponry:<br />The lasers, photon bolts...
3576404 3579396 Photon bolts and the particle beams.<br />Wait a minute. This is just like back home.
3579507 3584706 - What�s this?<br />- Careful, that�s Death Blossom,<br />a weapon of last resort.
3584813 3587805 Luckily, I was in here working on it<br />when the hangar went up.
3587849 3591307 Now, are you ready?<br />All systems... Go!
3592954 3595320 - Ignition!
3598526 3603020 - Wh-When... When did the hangar go up?<br />- I told you: When Xur attacked.
3603131 3605964 - And where were the Starfighters?<br />- In the hangar!
3606034 3610630 - You mean they�re dead?<br />- Death is a primitive concept.
3610738 3615835 I prefer to think of them<br />as battling evil in another dimension.
3615944 3618174 In another dimension?<br />How many are left?
3618246 3621340 - Including yourself?<br />- Yeah.
3622784 3625446 - One!<br />- One?
3637565 3639658 Hold it.
3641569 3644367 There�s no fleet, no Starfighters, no plan?
3644472 3646963 - One ship, you, me, and that�s it?<br />- Exactly!
3647075 3650374 Xur thinks you�re still on Earth. Classic<br />military strategy. Surprise attack.
3650478 3652912 - It�ll be a slaughter!<br />- That�s the spirit.
3652981 3656314 No, my slaughter.<br />One ship against the whole armada?
3656417 3660012 Yes. One Gunstar against the armada.
3660121 3665058 I've always wanted to fight a desperate<br />battle against incredible odds.
3667562 3670030 - Target lights, Alex.<br />- Target lights?
3670131 3673623 Yes. You might want to squeeze off<br />a few rounds while you have a chance.
3673735 3675635 Just work the bugs out of the system.
3675737 3678365 After all, it is her maiden voyage.
3698660 3701424 Steady.<br />Don�t fight the chair.
3701462 3705421 Take your time. Watch your gun sight.<br />Lead your targets.
3705466 3708094 And above all, relax!
3708203 3711468 Terrific. I'm about to get killed<br />a million miles from nowhere...
3711506 3714703 with a gung-ho iguana<br />who tells me, ��relax. ��
3717612 3720376 Interstellar!
3750945 3755143 - Alex!<br />- Sorry.
3757752 3760277 Okay, now, come on.<br />Ease it up.
3762557 3765549 Okay.
3765660 3768493 Oh, that�s... That�s it. Easy.
3768563 3771361 Nice and easy.<br />Yep.
3771466 3774993 - A little bit more and we�ll<br />get it in there, now.
3775103 3778072 - Alex!
3778106 3780802 Sorry.<br />Hi, Maggs.
3780908 3785208 - Alex, are you all right?<br />- Yeah. Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.
3786714 3788705 Come on.<br />Try it again.
3789917 3794013 Did you smell anything?
3794055 3797149 - Like what?<br />- Like a Z...
3797225 3799455 Forget it.
3806868 3810531 I just wanted to say<br />I'm sorry for slapping you last night.
3811939 3813907 Oh, that-that�s okay,<br />Maggs. Uh...
3813941 3816341 I deserved it.<br />I'm sorry.
3816444 3820141 Well, maybe we can make it up<br />to each other tonight at Silver Lake?
3849444 3852208 - The armada will break<br />through the frontier here...
3852246 3855044 and reach Rylos in 20 klicks.
3855116 3857516 Squadrons of deck fighters<br />will precede the mother ship.
3857618 3859552 Squadrons?<br />How many squadrons?
3859620 3861815 It isn�t the number of squadrons that concerns me.
3861923 3865324 It�s this communication turret that sends out<br />the commands to the deck fighters...
3865426 3867724 which enables them to act<br />as one during the fight.
3867762 3870731 Wait a second. We knock out<br />the turret to get the fighters.
3870765 3874064 But to get the turret, we have to<br />get through the fighters. We�re dead.
3874168 3877467 I'll have it all figured out<br />by the time we reach the frontier.
3880742 3883233 - What�s that?<br />- The frontier.
3892854 3896187 Strange. What�s a cargo ship doing<br />this close to the frontier?
3897358 3900191 Hail. This is Gunstar One.
3904232 3908601 I repeat, this is Gunstar One.<br />Identify yourself, please.
3911005 3912905 Alex, look out.
3915610 3917703 A Xurian ship!
3919814 3923545 Congratulations, Alex.<br />This is your first live target.
3923651 3925949 Live?
3929023 3931821 Within range in five klicks.<br />Get ready!
3936564 3939328 I've blocked its beam of frequency,<br />so it can�t report back to the armada.
3941469 3943334 - Fire when ready!<br />- Grig, wait!
3953347 3955645 We mustn�t lose them<br />in these caves, Alex! Fire!
3979207 3982108 Shoot, Alex!
3985146 3988309 Shoot!
3995923 3998357 You did it!
4003831 4008325 I did it? You did it!<br />You almost got me killed!
4009770 4013672 Uh... My deepest<br />apologies, Alex.
4013774 4019041 I had hoped that by putting you in the thick<br />of battle, a great Starfighter would emerge.
4019146 4024083 But alas. Perhaps... there was<br />never one within you to begin with.
4026687 4028587 I shall take you home.
4030224 4034183 You still may live<br />a long and fruitful life back there.
4034228 4038790 That is, until the Kodan reach Earth.
4038900 4040800 But then again...
4051646 4054911 ~ When it all goes wrong ~
4055016 4058247 Hey, yo, Blake!<br />Make that sucker blast, man!
4058319 4061254 - You got it, dude! All right!<br />- Whoo!
4061322 4065258 ~ You�ve seen things I never heard ~~
4067128 4069824 So Blake comes back in<br />to grab his pants, right?
4069931 4075062 Sees her old lady, and says, ��I hope this<br />doesn�t rule out dinner on Tuesday night. ��
4076837 4078737 That�s my man!
4081976 4084706 Alex, are you okay?
4084779 4088772 Hmm?<br />Yeah, sure. Why?
4088883 4093911 I don�t know. You�re just acting spaced<br />out. You�re... You�re not yourself.
4095790 4098918 Well, if you were me...
4098993 4101291 what would you be doing right now?
4104131 4107999 Well, for one thing,<br />I'd be trying to enjoy myself.
4108069 4110697 Leaning back.<br />Kidding around.
4110805 4113205 - Laughing.<br />- Laughing?
4113307 4115241 Well, it�s a start, Alex.
4115343 4118710 - Laughing.<br />~ There are things I'd like to say ~~
4162490 4164981 Nice place.<br />Reminds me of home.
4165026 4168894 - This reminds you of home?<br />- Oh, yes.
4173701 4176226 I live below ground...
4176303 4181002 with my wifeoid and 6,000 little Griglings.
4188015 4192008 At least, until Xur<br />turns them into slaves.
4197058 4201119 - Where does your kind live?<br />- Oh, uh, houses, mostly.
4202430 4204523 That�s caves above ground.
4204598 4208034 See, here.<br />Here�s my family.
4209837 4211828 See, that�s...
4211872 4214534 That�s my folks and my brother, Louis...
4214575 4216873 and that�s Maggie.
4218279 4220247 Uh, we live<br />in a mobile home.
4222149 4225175 That�s a cave that...<br />that goes places.
4225286 4227754 Only we never went anyplace.
4229857 4233850 A mobile cave that never went anywhere.<br />Fascinating.
4233961 4237954 Yeah, but we have below-ground caves<br />near the trailer parks.
4237998 4240967 Me and my brother, Louis,<br />used to play hide-and-seek in �em.
4242803 4244771 Hide-and-seek.
4244872 4247773 - What is it, Alex?<br />- Well, I was just thinkin�...
4247875 4249809 maybe we could hide here...
4249877 4254075 Let the armada pass by,<br />and then hit the turret from behind.
4254115 4256379 Then we might take them by surprise.
4262022 4264217 Your plan might really have worked.
4264325 4268159 What a pity there are no Starfighters<br />left to carry it out.
4268262 4271163 Yeah. Yeah.
4278773 4280638 A Xurian base!
4298659 4301355 Two more dead ahead!<br />Closing fast!
4325519 4328215 - Earth course is logged<br />into navigational beams.
4330591 4334550 - Grig?<br />- What is it, Alex?
4339834 4342064 Maybe there is a Starfighter left.
4381575 4384635 Ow!
4390618 4393416 What�s wrong? Should I<br />put my tongue in your ear now?
4393520 4396148 Don�t bother, Alex.
4396257 4399124 Well, it�s just... I'm kind of new<br />at these gland games.
4400628 4402721 What are you talking about?
4402830 4405355 It�s like you�re a million miles away, Alex!
4415542 4417942 Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />Wait. Darling.
4418045 4420946 Darling, forgive me.
4430157 4432648 Darling, forgive me.
4435696 4438256 Come on!
4438365 4441163 You�re my Juliet.<br />My Venus.
4445205 4449198 You�re my Juliet.<br />My Venus.
4452646 4456707 - Alex!<br />- All the other girls meant nothing to me.
4456750 4459810 It was you, you, you.
4459920 4463822 Shut up and talk dirty to me.
4463857 4466826 The other girls meant<br />nothing to me. It was you...
4466860 4469420 you, y...
4470965 4473126 - Should I talk dirty to you now?
4473233 4478535 - That does it.<br />- Oh, God. All right. I give up.
4478639 4481039 - I'm not Alex Rogan.<br />- What?
4481141 4484440 I'm a beta unit.<br />I'm an exact duplicate of Alex.
4484545 4487639 He�s up there saving the universe,<br />while I'm down here for target practice.
4489783 4492251 - See?
4498959 4502486 - Alex! Or whatever you are. Wait. Wait.
4502529 4505293 What are you d... Let me go. If that Zando-Zan<br />reports back that I'm not Alex...
4505332 4507300 Alex is in big trouble!
4507334 4510098 - You�re stayin� here.<br />- No, I'm not going anywhere until<br />I find out what�s going on!
4512606 4514631 Hey, my truck!
4514742 4517006 - Hey, hey, come back!
4518312 4520405 Scratch that paint, and you�re dead, Rogan!
4530424 4532517 Ready to invade, Commander.
4532626 4536653 - Invade.<br />- The Xurian ships have not<br />answered our invasion code.
4536730 4541064 The frontier is down, the moon is eclipsed,<br />the Starfighters are dead. Invade!
4542536 4546438 All squadrons ahead, half speed,<br />with energy probes on.
4577137 4579628 Energy probe.<br />Shut down, Alex. Shut down.
4579706 4582197 - Power off.
4599359 4602817 Alex? In space?
4602930 4606627 - Is this for real?<br />- Yes! That�s what I'm trying to tell you!
4606733 4610032 - It�s all for real!<br />- Well, then, don�t talk. Drive!
4622716 4625708 Commander Kril, we�re getting<br />a signal on the alert frequency.
4625819 4628686 - Acknowledge.
4631191 4634024 There it is. All right. Now, when<br />I give the signal, we�re gonna jump!
4634128 4637291 - What do you mean, ��jump��?<br />- We�re gonna ram him. - What?
4638499 4641297 Extermination Emissary<br />Zeta-six one message:
4641401 4643335 - Ready?<br />- Jump!
4643437 4646406 Alex!
4646507 4650307 - The last Starfighter...
4650410 4652901 You owe me one, Alex.
4658552 4662352 - Alex!
4662422 4664720 Transmission pulsars<br />have stopped, Commander.
4664758 4669320 - The last Starfighter...<br />- Is dead!
4669429 4672330 The last Starfighter<br />is dead!
4672432 4676459 Nothing can stop us now.<br />Ahead full. To Rylos!
4697090 4699320 The command ship!
4704231 4707200 There!<br />The turret at the far end!
4707301 4710293 I see it.
4712439 4717001 - Good luck, Starfighter.<br />- Thanks, Grig. For everything.
4730624 4733525 I love you,<br />Alex Rogan.
4733627 4736425 - Six.
4736463 4739125 - Heads up display. Check.<br />- Five.
4739233 4742760 - Lasers. Check. - Four.<br />- Particle beam. Check.
4742869 4745167 - Three.<br />- Proton bolts. Check.
4745272 4747672 - Two.<br />- Chair control. Check.
4747708 4750871 - One.<br />- Let�s do it.
4761288 4764086 - Tracking alert.
4766627 4769528 Unidentified craft.<br />What is it?
4774501 4777698 Wait. Gunstar!
4777738 4782107 So... the last Starfighter<br />is dead?
4784044 4786512 This has gone far enough.<br />Seize him!
4788015 4791314 How dare you?<br />I am the Emperor of Rylos!
4791418 4794353 I and I alone command this entire op...
4794454 4797150 Release me!<br />I command you!
4797224 4800216 You will pay for this with your lives!
4800327 4803228 All guns... fire!
4812673 4814937 There it is... the turret!
4814975 4818274 Alex, now!
4818378 4822041 - Yeah!<br />- Got it!
4822082 4825574 Hurry, Alex! Fire!<br />The armada�s almost to Rylos!
4843470 4847406 Hatchway to pod activated.
4849376 4851310 Escape pod ignition.
4851378 4855678 The Gunstar is gone from our sensors.<br />Alert wing commanders.
4855782 4858808 Communication turret is destroyed.
4863857 4866724 All communication radar systems<br />are out, Wing Commander.
4866827 4870422 Proceed with a visual attack formation.
4874534 4878368 - Life support good. Ammo packs at peak.
4878472 4880372 I think we�ve got to use Death Blossom.
4880474 4883932 Remember, Death Blossom delivers<br />only one massive volley at close range.
4884044 4887844 - Theoretically.<br />- What do you mean, ��Theoretically��?
4887881 4889872 After all, D.B.<br />Has never been tested.
4889950 4892748 It might overload the systems.<br />Blow up the ship.
4892786 4895482 What are you worried about?<br />Theoretically, we should already be dead.
4895589 4897750 - Hmm. Mmm.
4897791 4901056 Open Death Blossom petals.<br />Switch is on.
4915308 4917572 Do not trigger D.B.<br />Until we�re within range.
4917611 4920171 Just use your lasers until I give the signal.
4920280 4922714 - Remember...<br />- I've been recruited by the Star League...
4922816 4925011 to defend the frontier.
4925118 4928747 - Now, are you ready?<br />- This is it. Here we go.
4928822 4931620 Charge!
4960153 4962644 On your right!
4962756 4965657 Your left!
4965759 4968853 Evade!
4970864 4973389 Power packs are low!<br />We need time to recharge!
4975502 4978869 Laser power draining!
4985812 4989111 Grig, my weapons are gone!<br />Should I do it?
4989216 4993414 Easy, easy. Wait till they�re<br />all in Death Blossom range!
5002028 5003962 Fire!
5036663 5040895 - We did it.<br />- Yes, we actually did, didn�t we?
5044504 5046495 The command ship!
5046540 5049805 Our guns are out.<br />Damage control is repairing them.
5049910 5053607 Forget the guns!<br />Ramming speed!
5061655 5065113 - Grig, we need power!<br />- Death Blossom�s drained all power.
5065158 5069219 I'm working on it.<br />I'm trying to ram boost.
5072265 5075428 All we have left is life support power!
5081541 5085341 - Grig!
5089449 5092543 All right!
5098358 5102089 Weapons on! Target now! Fire. Fire!
5124517 5126815 Damage report!
5126920 5131118 Guidance system out.<br />Auxiliary steering out.
5131157 5134957 Divert!<br />Divert!
5135028 5138930 She won�t answer the helm! We�re locked<br />in the moon�s gravitational pull!
5139032 5141830 What do we do?
5142969 5145836 - We die.
5156249 5158149 Yahoo!
5167193 5170094 On behalf of the Star League<br />and all citizens of Rylos...
5170196 5173461 I congratulate you on your dazzling victory.
5173500 5175468 - Thank you.<br />- Thanks.
5175502 5178801 But as you know, the frontier is down...
5178905 5182136 Xur escaped, and there is still danger.
5182208 5184301 So I was wondering if you<br />wouldn�t be willing to stay on...
5184344 5187006 and rebuild the Starfighter Legion.
5187047 5189015 Wait a minute.
5189049 5192018 - Rebuild the Legion?<br />- Yes.
5192052 5197251 Of course, you�d have<br />the help of an old friend.
5197357 5199518 An old friend?<br />Who?
5215075 5217737 Centauri!<br />I thought you were dead!
5217844 5221780 Me die and miss all the excitement?<br />Oh, no.
5221815 5225979 I was merely dormant while my body repaired<br />itself. I won�t bore you with details.
5226086 5230614 Suffice it to say, you�re on Rylos,<br />my boy. Stop thinking human.
5230724 5234592 That�s lesson number one.<br />Now, lesson number two...
5234627 5238688 You�ve got a good thing going here.<br />Keep smiling. Don�t blow it.
5238798 5242325 Lesson number three...<br />Always trust Centauri.
5246906 5248999 Alex, they love you!
5253113 5257550 See? All Rylos is behind you.
5257650 5261347 - You�ve got to stay, Alex!<br />- You will stay, won�t you?
5261454 5264287 Of course he�ll stay.
5264324 5268920 That�s very reassuring, Centauri.<br />Grig, I leave it in your capable hands.
5271030 5273624 I'll stay.
5284811 5288269 Alex! Alex!
5301795 5306289 Greetings... Greetings, starfighter.
5306332 5309233 - Bunny, have you seen Alex?<br />- Can�t say that I have.
5309302 5313705 Well, ask Maggie. She knows<br />where he is. She was with him.
5313807 5316002 Maggie, where�s Alex?
5316042 5318306 Yeah, where�s my truck?<br />Where�s your boyfriend?
5318344 5322508 - Mrs. Rogan, about Alex: You see, he�s...
5324350 5326716 - What is it?<br />- What�s going on? I don�t know.
5349075 5351066 Oh, my God!
5352512 5355879 Whoo! All right!<br />We�re being invaded!
5383710 5386304 Maggie.
5386346 5388314 Maggie.
5450009 5453069 - Alex?<br />- Hi, Maggs.

5484744 5488646 - Is this a spaceship?
5488748 5491945 - I don�t know what�s gotten into him.<br />- I don�t understand that.
5492051 5495179 - It�s so strange!<br />- Wait. Hold it. Hold it, everybody.
5495254 5498553 Alex, what is all this?
5500760 5503058 I, uh... I've been<br />to another planet, Ma.
5503162 5507258 - Another planet?<br />- Who was it helped fix my antenna?
5507367 5509767 - Yeah, who stole my truck?<br />- And cut my electric?
5509869 5513703 - And ruined my stove?<br />- Oh, that was... That was a beta unit.
5513773 5516298 - Beta unit?<br />- A robot.
5516376 5518503 - Robot? What the...<br />- Come on!
5518611 5521102 - A monster!
5521180 5526049 - A monster! Hah!

5589115 5592209 You should be proud<br />of Alex, Mrs. Rogan.
5592318 5595151 You must all be proud of him.<br />He saved the Star League...
5595254 5597950 and hundreds of worlds, including Earth.
5598024 5601152 - Oh, for heaven�s sake!<br />- Oh, my God!
5603329 5605456 Time to leave, Alex.
5605565 5608534 - Alex?<br />- I have to, Ma.
5608634 5612092 - They need me up there.<br />- Oh, Alex, I always knew you�d leave someday...
5612138 5614629 but I never expected this.
5614740 5616970 Gee, can I go too, Alex?<br />Can I?
5617076 5619510 Sorry, squirt.<br />There�s only enough room up there...

5643603 5646731 Maggs, you gotta come. You see, I'm not...<br />I don�t know when I'm gonna be back.
5648307 5650275 Don�t you see? This is it.<br />This is our big chance.
5650309 5652539 It�s like what Otis says...
5652612 5655911 When it comes you gotta grab on<br />with both hands and hold tight.
5659051 5662851 Well, what about Granny, Alex?
5666425 5670191 You�re right.<br />I'm scared of leaving here.
5670229 5672197 Why can�t you just stay?
5672231 5675667 Maggie, I have to leave,<br />and I want you to come with me.

5800726 5804162 Greetings, Starfighter. You have been<br />recruited by the Star League...
5804230 5808030 to defend the frontier against Xur<br />and the Kodan Armada.
