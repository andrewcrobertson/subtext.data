2638428 2639725 He reduces me<br />to poverty again
2639804 2641397 and he thinks i'm<br />giving him a present.
2641472 2642735 What a world this is.
2642849 2644101 What is it, then?
2644183 2646106 It's a second chance,<br />my boy!
2646185 2649564 If you change your mind,<br />just tap the communo-crystals.
2654110 2656579 Keepit<br />Alex, Alex!
2656654 2659578 You're walking away<br />from history. History!
2659657 2663161 Did Chris Columbus say<br />he wanted to stay home? No!
2663244 2665838 What if the Wright Brothers thought<br />that only birds should fly?
2665913 2669713 And did Geloca think the Yulus<br />were too ugly to save?
2669792 2671260 Who's Geloca?
2673129 2674506 Never mind.
2676132 2677429 Listen, Centauri.<br />I'm not any of those guys.
2677508 2679021 I'm a kid from<br />a trailer park.

2780361 2782204 Of course I do.<br />I'm the beta unit.
2783197 2785416 What the hell's<br />a beta unit?
2785700 2791798 A beta unit is a simuloid, an exact<br />duplicate of you, only not as Ioud.
2793249 2794296 Huh?
2794375 2795627 I was in the starcar,<br />remember?
2795710 2796962 We shook hands?
2797044 2799467 I became you, unfortunately.
2801257 2803555 Let me get this straight.<br />You're a robot?

2817899 2819572 Are you kidding?<br />It's war up there!
2819650 2822745 Oh. Save the whales<br />and not the universe, huh?
2823446 2825323 Well, why don't you<br />go up there and fight?

3090337 3092760 Xur? Why is he after me?

3448028 3449541 Oh, no.
3459706 3463176 Am I to understand there's a beta<br />unit taking your place back home?
3463252 3464299 He's trying.
3464378 3467473 So it's safe to assume that Xur<br />thinks you're still on Earth.
3467548 3469300 Yeah.
3469383 3472136 That could work to our<br />advantage, theoretically.
3479143 3481521 Ah! Now you look human!
3484064 3485486 Is this my Gunstar?
3485566 3487989 This is a prototype, different<br />from the other ships.
3488068 3489866 She has a greater range,<br />more power,
3489945 3492073 and a slight<br />weapons modification.
3493282 3495000 And, of course,<br />she's got deflective plating,
3495075 3497498 so she can withstand<br />several direct hits.

3505127 3508131 maintain life support<br />and propulsion systems.
3509548 3510800 Okay. Where do I sit?

3533405 3535203 There in front of you<br />are the two switches
3535282 3537626 for your heads-up display.<br />Turn them on.
3542122 3543294 While you're engaging<br />the enemy,
3543373 3547003 the screen will reflect all<br />battle instruments towards you.
3548962 3549929 Hey, where did it go?
3550005 3552599 It's still there,<br />suspended in a xenon mist.
3552674 3554597 But it's only visible<br />if you look dead ahead.
3554676 3556644 Ah. Got it.
3556803 3558771 The lever on your left<br />is the chair controller.
3558847 3562147 As you can see, all guns will<br />track with your every move.
3566605 3567731 (CHUCKLES)
3569858 3572987 Grasp the target control<br />with your right hand.
3573070 3576620 At your fingers is the weaponry,<br />the Iasers, photon bolts...
3576698 3577870 Photon bolts and<br />the particle beams.
3577950 3579623 Wait a minute.<br />This is just like back home.
3580202 3581579 What's this?<br />Careful, careful,
3581662 3584962 that's Death Blossom,<br />a weapon of last resort.
3585040 3588214 Luckily, Iwas in here working<br />on it when the hangar went up.

3603767 3604939 And where were<br />the Starfighters?
3605018 3606144 In the hangar!
3606228 3607946 You mean they're dead?
3608021 3610069 Death is a primitive concept.
3611066 3615867 I prefer to think of them as<br />battling evil in another dimension.
3615946 3618620 In another dimension?<br />How many are left?
3618699 3619951 Including yourself?
3620409 3621661 Yeah.

3647060 3648152 Xur thinks<br />you're still on Earth.
3648228 3650356 Classic military strategy.<br />Surprise attack.
3650439 3651656 It'Il be a slaughter!
3651732 3653109 That's the spirit.
3653191 3654613 No, my slaughter.
3654693 3656616 One ship against<br />the whole Armada?
3656695 3660040 Yes. One Gunstar<br />against the Armada.
3660115 3664962 I've always wanted to fight a desperate<br />battle against incredible odds.
3667706 3668923 Target Iights, Alex.
3668999 3670125 Target Iights?
3670208 3671926 Yes. You might want<br />to squeeze off
3672002 3673675 a few rounds while<br />you have the chance.
3673754 3675756 Just work the bugs<br />out of the system.
3675839 3677967 After all,<br />it is her maiden voyage.
3699446 3701574 Steady.<br />Don't fight the chair.
3701656 3703533 Take your time.<br />Watch your gun sights.
3703617 3705415 Lead your targets.
3705494 3707838 And above all, relax!

3794332 3795379 Like what?
3795542 3796634 Like a Z...
3797711 3799054 Forget it.
3807053 3810774 I just wanted to say I'm sorry<br />for slapping you last night.
3812017 3814816 Oh, that's okay, Maggs.<br />I deserved it.

3850180 3852649 The Armada will break<br />through the Frontier here,

3855227 3857980 Squadrons of deck fighters<br />will precede the mother ship.
3858063 3859861 Squadrons?<br />How many squadrons?
3859940 3862193 It isn't the number of<br />squadrons that concerns me.
3862275 3864118 It's this communication<br />turret that sends out
3864194 3865696 the commands to<br />the deck fighters,
3865779 3868032 which enables them to act<br />as one during the fight.
3868114 3870788 Wait a second. We knock out the<br />turret to get the fighters.
3870867 3873370 But to get the turret, we have<br />to get through the fighters.
3873453 3874830 We're dead.

3924004 3925221 Live?

3936516 3938189 I've blocked its<br />beam of frequency,
3938268 3940236 so it can't report<br />back to the Armada.
3941730 3943528 Fire when ready!<br />Grig, wait!

4011341 4013514 My deepest apologies, Alex.
4014260 4016649 I had hoped that by putting<br />you in the thick of battle,
4016721 4019144 a great Starfighter<br />would emerge.
4019307 4024609 But, alas. Perhaps there was never<br />one within you to begin with.
4027190 4029033 Ishall take you home.
4030318 4033788 You still may live along<br />and fruitful life back there.
4034572 4037917 That is, until the<br />Ko-Dan reach Earth.
4039244 4040211 But then again...
