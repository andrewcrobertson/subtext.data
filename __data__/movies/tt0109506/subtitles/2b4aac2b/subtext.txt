56848 59920 People once believed<br />that when someone dies...
60143 64260 a crow carries their soul<br />to the land of the dead.
64522 67753 But sometimes,<br />something so bad happens...
67984 73011 that a terrible sadness is carried<br />with it and the soul can't rest.
73323 76235 Then, sometimes...<br />just sometimes...
76451 81240 the crow can bring that soul back<br />to put the wrong things right.
131547 133582 Hey, Sarge!
133757 135873 Yeah?
136051 140362 Shelly Webster and Eric Draven.<br />Wedding was tomorrow night.
140638 144677 Who the fuck gets married<br />on Halloween anyhow?
144935 148131 Nobody.
148354 151824 - Sir, we gotta move her.<br />- Do it.
152067 154979 - All right, guys, let's do it.<br />- Devil's fuckin' Night.
155195 158391 - What's the count so far?<br />- 143 fires.
158615 161288 - They're slacking off from last year.<br />- Three hours to go.
161493 166168 - Maybe they're just slow starters.<br />- Coming through!
169334 172530 Yeah, I remember.<br />But you guys just can't come in here<br />and take her away like this.
172754 177032 There are procedures to stick by.<br />You guys should have<br />cleared this with me first.
177300 179767 - Is this the victim?<br />- No, it's Amelia Earhart.
179969 182722 - We found her, Detective,<br />and you missed it.<br />- I don't care what her name is.
182930 185080 I didn't give the order<br />to move her.
185266 187984 Jesus, Albrecht. I can see why they<br />took away your gold shield.
188185 191973 Yeah, I wasn't a big enough asshole.<br />Come on. Let's go.
192231 195779 All right, clear out of here.
196026 198017 - Shelly?<br />- Stand back, kid.
200073 205192 - Where's Eric?<br />- Just don't worry about him.
205494 207564 Tell him to take care<br />of Sarah.
207747 210738 Look, I will. You just, uh,<br />lie back. Come on, come on.
221218 223288 - You Sarah?<br />- Yeah.
223471 227622 Yeah, look. Your sister...<br />she's gonna be okay.
227891 231803 She's not my sister.<br />Shelly just takes care of me.
232061 234734 She's my friend.<br />Her and Eric.
237943 241855 - You lied to her about Eric.<br />- Look, I had to.
242113 245469 And you're lying<br />to me about Shelly.
245701 247611 She's gonna die, isn't she?
250914 253303 Hey, uh...
256753 262190 Now, come on.<br />Come on, it's okay.
264552 266543 She's gonna be fine.
284948 289099 A building gets torched.<br />All that is left is ashes.
289368 291836 I used to think<br />that was true about everything...
292038 296235 families, friends, feelings.
296500 300254 But now I know that sometimes,<br />if love proves real...
300504 304622 two people who are meant to be<br />together... nothing can keep them apart.
332410 334605 Later.
343129 346165 What are you,<br />like the night watchman?
367653 369768 You know, what<br />this place needs...
369947 372825 is a good natural catastrophe.
373033 376991 - Earthquake, tornado, you know.<br />- No, no, no, no.
377245 380794 Mickey, come on, man. You... You got<br />to put the mustard underneath first.
381041 383236 Maybe a flood<br />like in the Bible.
383419 386330 Hey, hey, hey, let me do it.
386546 390425 There we go. All right.<br />How about some onions?
390676 393951 Come on. Come on, man.<br />Don't cheap out on me. Lots of onions.
394179 397410 - All right, here you go.<br />- Hey, all right.
397641 400154 Now we're talkin'.
400352 404630 Hey, it's the Sarah monster.
404898 408572 - How do you steer that thing<br />on a wet street?<br />- Pure talent. Hi.
408818 412208 See, now, Sarah, she's a genuine<br />hot dogger. You hungry?
412447 414517 - You buyin'?<br />- I'm buyin'.
414699 418214 - No onions though, okay?<br />- No onions?
418453 421525 They make you fart big time.
428004 430392 You know, Lake Erie<br />actually caught on fire once...
430589 433308 from all the crap<br />floating around in it.
434719 437551 I wish I could have seen that.
498614 501731 Fire it up! Yeah!
542241 545994 - Fire it up! We busted their machines!<br />- Shit!
569142 572373 Oh, oh, shit, guys.<br />T-Bird, cop car, cop car.
580153 582269 Bad people out<br />on the street tonight.
588412 590720 - Damn it!<br />- Oh, my God!<br />- What was that?
590913 592824 - You wait right here.<br />- Be careful.
592999 596309 Mickey, call it in for me!
678041 680077 Gabriel!
690344 693814 - Eric?<br />- Department of Housing!
694057 697890 Code violations?<br />Safety hazards?
698144 700214 Place looks fine to me.
700396 703069 Let's redecorate.
706735 708771 "Abashed, the devil stood...
708946 712460 and felt how awful goodness is.
712699 717090 Saw virtue in her shape, how lovely."<br />It's pornography.
718581 720696 Virtue?
723502 725254 Shelly?
727339 730251 - No! Eric!<br />- See ya!
730467 733061 No, no, no, no, me first.

739101 741535 - Shelly.<br />- Eric!
780975 783773 - Hey, that's good.<br />- That's good.
787273 791504 See if you can top that, man.<br />Can you top that?
791777 794530 Look at that.<br />Look at that.
794739 798890 Here's to Devil's Night,<br />my new favourite holiday.

1395286 1398641 - Is the man in?<br />- He's taking a meeting.
1428277 1430187 You're thinking<br />about the past.
1435242 1437311 Dad gave me this.
1437493 1441486 Fifth birthday.
1441748 1446218 He said childhood's over<br />the moment you know you're gonna die.
1459765 1462643 Is she asleep?

1521910 1524140 I told you to stay out of here.
1524329 1527843 So I guess you're not gonna be home<br />till a lot later, huh, Darla?
1528082 1531916 She's busy. Go play with<br />your dolls or something, okay?
1532170 1534479 I don't have any dolls.
1536632 1540830 - Get some food, huh?<br />- Somebody already bought me dinner.<br />The police.
1546684 1550233 "Somebody already bought me dinner.<br />The police."
1560406 1565116 Thirty, I go 40 dollars.<br />And 20 from 60...
1565411 1567719 Who the fuck is this now?
1567913 1571906 Hey! Piss off!<br />We're closed!
1574878 1578553 Go sleep it off<br />somewhere else, dusthead,<br />unless you want to get mutilated.
1584137 1586446 Always got to dick off.
1586640 1590427 Goddamn creatures of the night,<br />they never learn.
1592312 1593950 Hey! Hey!
1598902 1602451 "Suddenly I heard a tapping,<br />as if someone...
1602698 1605495 gently rapping,<br />rapping at my chamber door."
1608370 1610600 What are you talking about?
1610789 1613541 You heard me rapping, right?
1613750 1617709 You're trespassing,<br />and you owe me a fuckin' new door!
1620298 1623608 - I'm looking for something<br />in an engagement ring.<br />- Yeah?
1623843 1626993 - Gold.<br />- You're looking for a coroner,<br />shit-for-brains.
1631142 1632860 Oh, shit.
1633019 1636374 Oh, shit on me!
1636605 1639039 Shit on me.<br />Shit on me!
1646240 1648390 Mr Gideon.<br />You're not paying attention.
1653372 1656250 No! My hand!
1656459 1661293 I repeat,<br />a gold engagement ring, yes?
1661589 1665263 It was pawned here a year ago<br />by a customer of yours named Tin Tin.
1669179 1671693 He confided in me<br />before he ran out of breath.
1676812 1681931 - Who's this sack of shit?<br />- That's Tin Tin, one of<br />T-Bird's little helpers.
1682233 1685145 I think you can rule out<br />accidental death.
1685362 1688034 Don't any of your street demons<br />have real grown-up names?
1688239 1692118 This could be a turf hit, but it<br />doesn't look like your usual gang crap.
1692369 1696998 Oh, come on, Albrecht, spare me.<br />You're a beat cop now, so be a beat cop.
1697290 1699565 I'm supposed to thank you<br />for that, right?
1699751 1702901 Word to the wise:<br />Watch your fuckin' mouth.
1704255 1706530 What the hell<br />do you call that?
1708635 1713913 I call it blood, Detective. I suppose<br />you'll write it up as graffiti.
1714223 1716862 You can leave<br />my crime scene now, okay?
1724901 1727733 - Warmer?<br />- What are you doing?<br />- Don't you know this game?
1727945 1732143 What game are you talking about?<br />Okay, the rings.<br />I'll tell you about the rings!
1732408 1736958 They're in that-that metal box!<br />It's under the shelf there!
1737246 1742194 Take... Take the fucking rings out! You<br />can choke on them, you son of a bitch!
1746005 1748473 - Look, it goes up to the attic.<br />- Okay.
1757641 1759677 No, no.
1759851 1762809 No, no, no.
1765440 1769479 Oh, it's beautiful.<br />I don't believe it.
1773573 1775848 Shelly.
1784125 1786434 I love you.
1793552 1796349 - You have one chance to live.<br />- Look, man, take anything you want.
1796554 1800513 - Thank you.<br />- Take anything!
1800767 1804520 Now you're going to tell me<br />where to find the rest<br />of Tin Tin's little party pals.
1804770 1806681 The Pit. They all<br />hang out at the Pit.
1806856 1812487 All of T-Birds's little potato-heads<br />hang out there. And Funboy,<br />he lives there upstairs, all right?
1812820 1816574 - Funboy.<br />- Oh, baby, oh.
1816824 1819132 - Shit!<br />- A whole jolly club...
1819326 1821965 - Stop! Stop! Please!<br />- With jolly pirate nicknames!
1822163 1825234 - Stop! Jesus Christ in a taxicab!<br />- Hold still.
1827084 1830315 Each one of these is a life...
1830546 1832934 a life you helped destroy.
1833131 1835599 Look, I'm begging you, all right?<br />Don't kill me.
1837302 1839418 I'm not gonna kill you.
1839597 1843555 Your job will be to tell the rest of<br />them that death is coming for them...
1843809 1846004 tonight.
1852234 1856385 Tell them Eric Draven<br />sends his regards.
1858615 1862369 You walk outta here,<br />they're gonna erase your sorry ass.
1862619 1866452 You're nothing but street grease,<br />ya hear that... street grease,<br />you motherfucker!
1866706 1871301 - Is that gasoline I smell?<br />- No, man, no. No!
1871586 1874896 No! No!
1890730 1894039 It's on the house, kiddo,<br />you know that.
1894274 1896424 One root beer.
1898571 1901164 I can't do anything.
1901365 1905643 Your mom, technically,<br />she's off right now.
1905911 1907947 Yeah, way off.
1912668 1916501 Police! Don't move!<br />I said, "Don't move!"
1918465 1920535 I thought the police<br />always said, "Freeze."
1920718 1924471 I am the police and I say don't move,<br />Snow White. You move, you're dead.
1926056 1930174 And I say<br />I'm dead and I move.
1930436 1933154 Not one more step.<br />I'm serious.
1933355 1937507 Then shoot, if you will,<br />Officer Albrecht.
1937776 1942485 What are you, nuts?<br />Walking into a gun? You high?
1942781 1945500 - You don't remember me?<br />- What are you talking about?
1945701 1950330 How about Shelly?<br />Do you remember Shelly Webster?
1950622 1952692 Shelly Webster's dead,<br />my friend.
1952874 1957264 I want you to move over<br />to the kurb there. Go on,<br />real nice and easy. Come on. Move it!
1959047 1962197 Okay, we're gonna<br />wait here for backup.
1962425 1966703 - It's gettin' too friggin' weird for me.<br />- Oh, it gets better.
1966971 1969280 Do you know someone<br />named T-Bird?
1969474 1973864 He had a friend who shouldn't<br />have played with knives. Like the coat?
1974145 1976295 You're the guy<br />that murdered Tin Tin.
1976481 1980871 - Hey, check it out.<br />- He was already dead.
1981152 1983871 He died a year ago,<br />the moment he touched her.
1986281 1989353 They're all dead.<br />They just don't know it yet.
1990661 1992379 Get away from there!
1992537 1995973 Cops! Come on!<br />Get outta here!
1996208 1998563 Leave it, leave it! Run!
2004049 2007802 Oh, great, great.
2008053 2013207 Guy shows up looking like<br />a mime from hell and you<br />lose him right out in the open.
2013517 2019113 Well, at least he didn't do that walking<br />against the wind shit. I hate that.
2019439 2023192 - Little early for Devil's Night.<br />- What the hell is going on, man?
2024944 2027458 You are very restless.
2027656 2030534 Just wish I was a little<br />hungry again, that's all.
2030742 2035054 - Be careful of what you ask for.<br />- Yeah, you may get it, I know.
2046549 2049621 There are energies<br />aligning against you.
2049844 2052199 Seeing is believing,<br />isn't it?
2063774 2066004 Mmm, yummy.
2071490 2075244 Gideon's pawnshop just burned down<br />to the foundation.
2075495 2077724 Nobody cleared this<br />little event with me.
2077913 2079790 I didn't have nothing<br />to do with that.
2079957 2082312 Well, sure.<br />You must be awful disappointed.
2082501 2086539 I got trouble. One of<br />my crew got himself perished.
2086797 2088992 - Yeah, and who might that be?<br />- Tin Tin.
2089174 2093530 Somebody stuck his blades in all<br />his major organs in alphabetical order.
2093804 2099355 Gentlemen, by all means, I think we<br />ought to have an introspective moment<br />of silence for poor old Tin Tin.
2102437 2104746 You're working for me<br />tomorrow night, right?
2104940 2109615 - Whatever you say, I can do.<br />- Good. That's very reassuring.
2109903 2114498 I still ain't heard the story<br />on why Gideon's burned down.
2114782 2119572 Is that a natural catastrophe<br />or act of God or something?
2119871 2122942 Call it my need to know.
2154780 2157248 Let go, you creep!
2160702 2162374 Nah.
2162538 2165689 You need to slow down,<br />you dickhead!
2168043 2171718 - He couldn't have stopped.<br />- He was a buttface.<br />I could have made it.
2173924 2178951 - What are you supposed to be,<br />a clown or something?<br />- Sometimes.
2181098 2185807 It's more like surfing than skating.<br />I wish the rain would stop, just once.
2187145 2190535 - It can't rain all the time.<br />- Eric?
2207665 2212056 Don't thank me. Are we<br />fighting the good fight?
2212337 2216488 Double homicide a year ago.<br />No convictions.
2216758 2220876 Annie, look at that.
2221138 2225130 "We, the undersigned tenants<br />of 1929 Caulderon Court Apartments..."
2225391 2227666 - What is this, a petition?<br />- A big "kick me" sign...
2227852 2230763 for a very nice girl who found herself<br />a cause and the cause got her killed.
2230980 2233619 She was fighting tenant eviction<br />in that neighbourhood?
2233816 2238935 Miss Shelly Webster and her nice<br />rock-and-roll boyfriend, Eric Draven.
2239238 2243151 You know, the last time<br />you went snooping around on a case is<br />when you got put back on the beat.
2243409 2247242 - Yeah, I know.<br />Torres keeps reminding me.<br />- Oh, I bet he does.
2255295 2259049 You're going to wind up<br />working a school crosswalk.
2259300 2265249 - I'm cool.<br />- You didn't get that file from me,<br />okay? And don't tell me you owe me one.
2265598 2267633 Ah, I owe you one!
2267807 2269718 Yeah, right.
2269893 2271963 Damn.
2297503 2301178 Tomorrow night, we can...<br />we can get high...
2301424 2304973 and watch this whole fucking city<br />burn from that window.
2307680 2310956 <i>I am the park</i>
2311184 2314653 <i>I am glow</i>
2314895 2318774 <i>In the motherfuckin'dark</i>
2319025 2321060 <i>I am shocked</i>

2327408 2330160 <i>No more</i>
2330369 2332519 - There's a big fuckin' bird over there.<br />- <i>No more</i>
2332705 2334582 Huh?
2335832 2339666 - <i>No more</i><br />- It's a squab.
2339920 2343434 Come here, bird.<br />Hey, bird. Hey, bird.
2343673 2345903 Bird. B-B-Birdie.
2346093 2348561 Here, birdie, birdie, birdie,<br />birdie, birdie, birdie.
2348762 2351594 Come here, birdie, birdie, birdie,<br />birdie, birdie, birdie.

2361900 2364414 What the fuck?
2370951 2375262 No, man! Don't do that! You nearly<br />gave me a fucking heart attack!
2375538 2377608 Look at him.
2377791 2380510 Don't sweat it.
2381669 2385218 It's time for you to take<br />your bird and leave, freako.
2394015 2397927 Take your shot, Funboy.<br />You got me dead bang.
2400146 2405458 You are seriously fucked up.<br />Did you look in the mirror?
2405776 2408529 You need professional help.
2411449 2415566 Bingo!<br />He shoots. He scores.
2425880 2430350 - Jesus Christ!<br />- Jesus Christ?
2430634 2435184 Stop me if you heard this one.<br />Jesus Christ walks into a hotel.
2438183 2440617 Ow.
2440811 2444485 He hands the innkeeper<br />three nails and he asks...
2444731 2447086 Don't you ever fuckin' die?
2447276 2449392 "Can you put me up<br />for the night?"
2455033 2460060 - Does that hurt?<br />- Fuck. Yes, it fuckin' hurts.
2460371 2462327 Oh, God.
2462499 2465774 Look what you've done<br />to my sheets.
2490151 2492028 I've got a gun<br />in my pocket.
2495156 2497749 You're happy to see me,<br />aren't you?
2515634 2519342 Stay away!<br />Stay away from me!
2527395 2531024 Look.
2531275 2535552 Mother is the name for God<br />on the lips and hearts of all children.
2535820 2540371 Do you understand?<br />Morphine is bad for you.
2552003 2555632 Your daughter is out there<br />on the streets waiting for you.
2587788 2591417 If I wanted ice, I would have<br />asked for ice! Now fill it up!
2593336 2595929 Fill it up yourself,<br />macho man.
2596129 2598723 I really need this.
2605973 2609045 All right.
2609268 2612304 - You burn yourself playing with matches?<br />- Fuck off.
2612521 2615558 - You have an appointment.<br />- Well, shit on me.
2615774 2620130 - Drink up.<br />- This is a first.<br />Do I bow or do I curtsy?
2620403 2623395 Get my friend here<br />a glass of blood.
2623615 2627289 - Hey, hey, hon!<br />- Hey, good night, Darla.
2631832 2634868 You stay put right there.
2644427 2646463 Get away, steamhead.
2665781 2667658 Shh.
2678627 2682415 <i>Well, as you can see,</i><br /><i>I'm here on the corner of 27th Street</i><br /><i>and East Washington Place...</i>
2682673 2685949 <i>the site of last year's biggest</i><br /><i>Devil's Night conflagration.</i>
2686177 2689532 <i>It was exactly one year ago</i><br /><i>that the building you see</i><br /><i>across the street from me...</i>
2689763 2691879 <i>was totally demolished by fire.</i>
2692057 2696527 <i>The fire that was fought</i><br /><i>by seven fire companies, but cost</i><br /><i>the lives of two fire fighters.</i>
2696812 2701521 <i>In fact, if it weren't</i><br /><i>for the constant surveillance</i><br /><i>by the local police precincts...</i>
2701816 2704455 Freeze!
2704653 2708885 Jesus. Don't ever do that, man.
2709157 2712627 Fuck.
2712869 2715224 - Good likeness.<br />- I saw your body, man.
2715414 2718962 You... You died. You got buried.
2719208 2721597 You still have your hat on.
2724005 2726359 I gotta sit down.
2729803 2732032 Holy shit.
2733597 2736111 Say...
2736309 2740426 are you some kind of... of ghost?
2740688 2742565 Boo!
2750239 2754596 I don't know what I am. I need you<br />to tell me what happened to us.
2756829 2760708 Well, you took a six-story<br />swan dive out of a window.
2760958 2763915 She, ah, was beaten and raped.
2764127 2768518 Died at the hospital.<br />Hey, you asked, man.
2768799 2771073 I mean, come on.<br />Read the file.
2771259 2775013 Shelly Webster held on<br />for 30 hours in intensive care.
2775264 2778778 And her body finally<br />just gave it up.
2779017 2782293 I saw it, man.<br />I-I couldn't do jack for her.
2792947 2794778 - Hey.<br />- Don't touch me!
2798078 2800194 Hey.
2802123 2805195 - You okay?<br />- I saw her.
2807379 2812406 I saw her through your eyes.<br />You stayed with her the whole time.
2812717 2818268 Yeah, well, you got<br />to understand something, all right?
2818598 2822273 I was... I was hoping<br />she'd come out of it, you know.
2822519 2826227 Uh, give me something<br />I could work with.
2826480 2830996 Yeah. Look, I...
2831276 2833665 Why didn't you do<br />something about it?
2833863 2837014 You think any of those people<br />in that building... even the ones<br />who signed the petition...
2837241 2840550 would talk after<br />what happened to you?
2840786 2843858 I kept asking questions and...
2844081 2846640 finally got busted for sticking my nose<br />where it wasn't wanted.
2850754 2852631 This your wife?
2852798 2857109 Yeah, we, uh... Well, not any more.<br />We're getting a divorce.
2859138 2861970 It's funny.
2862182 2865618 Little things used to mean<br />so much to Shelly.
2865853 2868083 I used to think<br />they were kind of trivial.
2868272 2871581 Believe me,<br />nothing is trivial.
2882285 2886721 You shouldn't smoke these.<br />They'll kill you.
2891920 2894672 You gonna vanish<br />into thin air again?
2898635 2901023 I thought I'd use<br />your front door.
2904098 2909774 Look, man, um, I'm sorry<br />as hell for what happened<br />to you and your girlfriend.
2911564 2913794 Yeah.
2919488 2920967 Yeah.
2921991 2924504 I got stabbed!<br />I shot the son of a bitch!
2924702 2927216 I watched the bullet hole<br />close by itself.
2927413 2930802 And then my business<br />gets blown up real good.
2931041 2934113 - Other than that, my day sucked.<br />- Yeah.
2934336 2936770 I saw him too.<br />He had a guitar.
2936964 2941195 He winked at me before he jumped out<br />a fourth-floor window like he had wings.
2941468 2943663 He winked at ya?
2943846 2947633 Musicians.<br />What else did you see?
2947891 2950724 So far I haven't heard shit about what<br />you're going to do about all this crap!
2950936 2955804 I mean, what do I get? My livelihood,<br />it got flushed away and went swirling.
2958110 2960782 - You ain't lost everything.<br />- Yeah?
2960987 2965742 And maybe you're not<br />such a big shot either! Ow! Jesus!
2966034 2968752 Fair enough. Catch.
2971164 2974759 - Jesus.<br />- Say hello to the last fellow<br />who wouldn't cooperate with me.
2975002 2976912 What are you tellin' me, this...<br />You tellin' me this thing is real?
2977086 2980442 All the power in the world<br />resides in the eyes, fella.
2980673 2984551 Sometimes they're more useful<br />than the people who bear them.
2984802 2988795 You know, you're directly out of<br />your fucking mind! You know that!
2990725 2993761 Yeah. Eyes see.
2993978 2996811 It's one of the most important things<br />I learned from my sister.
2997023 2999820 Sister? She's supposed<br />to be your sister?
3000025 3003495 My father's daughter.<br />That's right.
3003738 3007047 What's the matter,<br />you don't see the resemblance?
3007282 3009955 Now, let's take it<br />from the top, friend.
3010161 3012675 And a lot of detail.<br />What do you say?
3012872 3016181 He had a bird with him.<br />Nearly pecked my face off.
3016417 3019773 He-He told me to tell T-Bird<br />that death was on its way.
3020004 3024201 Whatever the fuck that means.<br />And... Draven.
3024466 3026900 He said his name was Eric Draven.
3027094 3029130 Want to relax that thing now?
3029304 3033775 And this bird man,<br />he just happened to let you live, huh?
3034059 3037971 You sure you ain't making all of this up<br />just to save your own ass?
3038229 3040902 I ain't makin' all this up.
3041108 3045578 I ain't twisted<br />like you two fucks.
3047572 3049608 All right.
3054078 3059152 A boy and his bird.<br />Awful touching.
3059459 3061369 Yeah.
3069635 3072468 Oh, for fuck's sake, die, will ya?<br />Give me that thing.
3079562 3084032 - Thanks.<br />- Funboy said he saw a black bird too.
3084316 3086511 A big one.
3086694 3090447 Then he choked to death<br />on his own blood.
3090697 3094053 I'll have the janitor, uh,<br />come on up.
3157889 3162120 You again.<br />You lost or hungry?
3162393 3163951 Hi.
3167523 3171038 <i>It can't rain all the time...</i><br /><i>Can't rain all the time...</i>
3171277 3176748 <i>Can't rain all the time... Can't rain</i><br /><i>all the time... Can't rain all the time...</i>
3182788 3185222 I don't know how many times I gotta<br />tell you. We're in this together.
3185416 3189091 We ain't and one part falls<br />and it all falls.
3189336 3191486 - Do you know how long it took us<br />to put this together?<br />- Yeah, a long time.
3191672 3194744 That piece of rat shit made Tin Tin<br />into a fuckin' voodoo doll.
3194967 3197196 Tin Tin was a dick.
3197385 3200138 Tin Tin.
3200347 3204306 Fire it up! Fire it up!<br />Fire it up! Fire it up!
3204559 3206868 Fire it up!
3210149 3214983 - No Funboy.<br />- Probably still bangin' away on Darla.
3220575 3224454 Smokes and road beers.<br />Be quick.
3224704 3226899 I'm on it.
3256569 3259844 What the fuck are you<br />supposed to be, man?
3261824 3264133 I'm your passenger.
3271751 3273661 Drive.
3278841 3282674 What's all this happy horseshit?<br />Hey, T-Bird! T-Bird!
3288267 3291383 - Oh, shit.<br />- What the fuck's the matter with you?
3291603 3295391 Stupid asshair!<br />You hit my car!
3302573 3306804 What do you want, man?<br />Money? Drugs? I got it.
3308620 3311372 We could use you.<br />You did Tin Tin.
3311581 3314539 - This is business, right?<br />- Faster.
3317629 3319380 You got that cream stuff?
3321883 3324192 I hate this.<br />They can't even call it cream legally.
3325303 3327736 What in the crap...
3332352 3334945 Oh, look.<br />You're makin' us popular.
3335146 3337819 When they flash us like that,<br />they ain't friends.
3343529 3346407 <i>This is vehicle 38.</i><br /><i>We got us a big ol'red hot rod.</i>
3349035 3351104 Hey!
3352538 3357565 You got somethin' personal, amigo,<br />we can work it out, right? Huh?
3362465 3365900 Damn! Dead end!
3369179 3371534 Look out!
3374935 3377085 Oh, man, get out of the way!
3389282 3392354 Holy shit!<br />Goddam foreign cars!
3397081 3398594 Shit! Fuckin'...
3405798 3409347 Oh, I hate this.<br />This ain't good.
3410928 3413237 T-Bird, I got you, man!<br />I'm coming!
3414474 3416749 Shit!
3430364 3432673 Remember? Yeah, I remember everything.<br />But I don't know...
3432867 3436939 What? What? Huh? What?<br />What are you talkin' about?
3437204 3440833 No, no, no, no, no.<br />You mean that place downtown?
3441083 3443961 Yeah, I remember her. We needed to<br />put some fear into that little lady.
3444169 3447081 She wasn't going along with<br />our tenant relocation programme.
3447298 3452974 Then her idiot boyfriend shows up<br />and turns a simple sweep-and-clear<br />into a total cluster fuck.
3453304 3456261 Who gives a shit?<br />It's ancient history.
3456473 3459590 What? What do you want?<br />What is it? What?
3459810 3462802 Speak to me. Speak!
3464522 3467878 Did you send us these complaints?
3468110 3471261 Come here.<br />"Abashed the devil stood."
3471487 3474320 Does it get you sweaty?
3474532 3478764 I know you. I know you.<br />I knew I knew you.
3479036 3481391 I knew I knew you.
3481581 3483856 But you ain't you.<br />You can't be you.
3484042 3487477 We put you through the window.<br />There ain't no comin' back.
3487712 3490749 This is the really real world.<br />There ain't no comin' back.
3490965 3493240 We killed you dead.<br />There ain't no comin' back.
3496304 3497817 T-Bird...
3497972 3500805 There ain't no comin' back!<br />There ain't no comin' back!
3503561 3505711 T-Bird.
3508233 3513909 "Abashed the devil stood<br />and felt how awful goodness is."
3514238 3516957 He felt how awful goodness is.
3519243 3521632 He felt...
3532422 3535732 T-Bird. T-Bird!

3619883 3622795 Wait. You loved eggs.
3623012 3625081 Yeah, when I was five.
3625263 3628778 So what do you want now,<br />black coffee and cigarettes?
3629018 3632851 So what did you take<br />to become Mother of the Year?
3633104 3637336 Oh, it wasn't drugs.<br />Someone kind of woke me up.
3637609 3643126 - Who?<br />- Oh, it was nuts.
3643448 3648441 You're acting weird. Did you win<br />the lottery or something, Darla?
3651248 3656037 Oh, forget it. I never was<br />too good at this mommy shit.
3656336 3659533 Over easy.

3675230 3677538 Hey, Albrecht.
3680484 3683044 This is the third hit<br />in your hood in 24 hours.
3683237 3686273 We just fished this out of the river.<br />He's fused to his own car.
3686490 3690529 - We're gonna have to I.D. His teeth.<br />- His name is T-Bird.
3690787 3694415 Arson was his specialty. Looks like<br />he zigged when he should have zagged.
3694665 3699056 - Case closed.<br />- Bull-fuckin'-shit.
3699337 3701645 Come here.
3704967 3707322 You're holding out on me.
3707511 3711981 I got a goddam vigilante killer<br />knockin' off scumbags left and right,<br />and you're covering up for somebody.
3713726 3716603 Who's the cartoon character<br />in the painted face?
3716811 3718881 Hey, you're the detective.<br />Why don't you tell me?
3719064 3722101 Okay. Gideon's blows all to hell,<br />and you're having a chitchat<br />with some weirdo...
3722318 3725229 who winds up in T-Bird's car<br />when it zigs instead of zags.
3725445 3727834 Then you steal one of<br />my case files from homicide...
3728031 3730306 and you're saying this is just<br />a fuckin' automobile accident?
3730492 3732925 - Come on!<br />- Yeah. Good speech though.
3733119 3736714 I didn't want to interrupt you.<br />It sounded good. You know,<br />you gotta write that shit down.
3736957 3741825 All right, smart-ass. The captain's got<br />a little love note waiting for you.
3742128 3744562 Welcome to the first day<br />of the rest of your suspension.
3744756 3747315 Suspension? For what?
3747508 3749738 Misconduct.
3751972 3753882 Yeah, give me the lab.
3804606 3807165 - One for sorrow, two for joy...<br />- Come here.
3807358 3810077 And three for a girl<br />and four for a boy.
3815241 3816879 - Dancing...<br />- Here I am.
3850276 3852584 Eric?
3855072 3858826 Man, Sarah, you're going crazy.
3859077 3862148 Gabriel.
3862371 3864965 I thought you were dead.
3865166 3867475 You're not dead, are you?
3893360 3895669 I knew it was you.
3898115 3900423 Even with the make-up.
3905747 3908135 I remembered your song.
3908333 3911928 You said, "Can't rain all the time."
3912170 3914478 That is from your song, right?
3925767 3928361 Come on, Eric, I know you're here.
3930980 3933813 I miss you and Shelly.
3938237 3940705 Gets so lonely all by myself.
3944243 3948521 The hell with you.<br />I thought you cared.
3948789 3951586 Sarah, I do care.
3962302 3965658 That's him. That's him!<br />But he looked different.
3965890 3968005 He was all painted up white<br />like some kind of dead whore.
3968183 3971095 I seen him. T-Bird, he sent me in<br />for some road beers, right?
3971311 3973779 Then he took him away.<br />But I chased him down.
3973981 3976733 And he flash-fried T-Bird<br />to his fuckin' car!
3976942 3980218 Oh, T-Bird!<br />Here's to you, buddy.
3980445 3984232 Maybe we oughta just videotape this,<br />play it back in slow motion.
3985867 3990576 - Fire it up! Fire it up!<br />Fire it up! Fire it up!<br />- You see the grave?
3990872 3995468 - Empty.<br />- Fire it... Grave? What grave?
3995752 3998982 - What about my fuckin' grave?<br />- Three out of four.<br />- Oh, man!
3999213 4001886 He's working his way<br />back to this speed freak right here.
4002092 4004606 It's not fair.<br />It's Funboy's fault.
4004803 4008920 That boy was out of control. T-Bird,<br />he came in, he says, "Waste 'em both."
4009182 4012413 And now this ghost<br />gonna kill my ass next!
4015563 4019272 This ghost gonna kill my ass next.
4019526 4022198 - This ghost gonna kill m...<br />- Hey.
4022403 4024280 It ain't no ghost.
4026282 4029751 - They have all arrived.<br />- Watch him.
4029994 4032633 We might need him.
4032830 4035139 Ghost gonna kill my ass.
4048262 4052459 He like his plain or with onions?
4052724 4055716 Fine. Don't talk to me.
4055936 4060213 When someone's dead,<br />they can't come back, can they?
4060482 4062632 That's what I thought.
4062818 4065127 Are you referring<br />to anyone in particular?
4065321 4067550 You'll just think I'm nuts.
4067739 4071414 Yeah, well, then maybe<br />they'll have to lock us both up.
4071660 4073889 You see him too?
4074078 4077309 I saw somebody.
4077540 4080850 Maybe it was your fairy godfather.
4081086 4083394 Eric didn't come back for me.
4083588 4088742 He can't be my friend any more<br />because I'm... I'm alive.
4089051 4092327 You want a friend to walk you home?

4185563 4188679 Boys.
4188899 4191936 It seems our friend T-Bird<br />won't be joining us this evening...
4192153 4194872 on account of a slight case of death.
4195073 4197302 You wanna sit down?
4200328 4204479 Well, well, well.<br />Devil's Night is upon us again.
4204748 4209697 I thought we'd throw a little party,<br />start a bunch of fires,<br />make a little profit.
4210004 4212278 I like the pretty lights.
4214466 4219061 Problem is, it's all been done before.<br />You see what I'm sayin'?
4219346 4223134 - That's no reason to quit.<br />- Wrong.
4223392 4227907 Best reason to quit.<br />Only reason to quit.
4228188 4232500 A man has an idea.
4232776 4235050 The idea attracts others...
4235236 4237431 like-minded.
4237614 4242767 The idea expands.<br />The idea becomes an institution.
4244329 4246923 What was the idea?
4247124 4249478 See, that's what's<br />been bothering me, boys.
4249667 4252056 And I tell ya, when I used to think<br />about the idea itself...
4252253 4256212 it'd put a big old smile on my face.
4256466 4262938 You see, gentlemen,<br />greed is for amateurs.
4263306 4269653 Disorder, chaos, anarchy...<br />now, that's fun!
4270021 4273137 - What about Devil's Night?<br />- What about it?
4273357 4276474 I started the first fires<br />in this goddam city.
4276694 4279765 Before I knew it, every charlatan<br />and shitheel was imitating me.
4279988 4283663 Do you know what they got now?
4283909 4287787 Devil's Night greeting cards.
4288038 4290393 Isn't that precious?
4290583 4292858 Yeah.
4293044 4299562 The idea has become the institution,<br />boys. Time to move along.
4299925 4302233 You don't want us to do<br />"Light My Fire" time for the whole city?
4302427 4304736 No.
4304930 4308969 No, I want you to set a fire so goddam<br />big, the gods'll notice us again.
4309226 4310977 - That's what I'm sayin'.<br />- Right.
4311144 4314773 I want all of you boys to be able<br />to look me straight in the eye<br />one more time and say...
4315023 4317855 "Are we havin' fun or what?"
4318067 4320706 - Hey, you! What's your name? Skank!<br />- Huh? What?
4320904 4323941 - You don't feel that?<br />- I feel like a little worm<br />on a big fuckin' hook.
4325575 4327884 "I feel like a little worm<br />on a big fuckin' hook."
4328078 4332230 Well, boy, your mama<br />must be damn proud of you.
4335335 4337451 How the hell'd that thing<br />get in here?
4338964 4341352 Gentlemen.
4342800 4346031 Let me go! Let me go! I gotta go!
4350766 4357318 So you're him, huh?<br />The avenger. The killer of killers.
4357690 4362605 Nice outfit.<br />Not sure about the face though.
4362904 4365417 I just want him.
4365614 4368048 Well, you can't have him.
4368242 4370551 - Well...<br />- Let me go.
4372955 4376391 I see you have made your decision.
4376626 4380220 - Now let's see you enforce it.<br />- Aw, this is already<br />boring the shit out of me.
4380462 4383101 Kill him!
4388220 4390859 Ooh, that had to hurt.
4393642 4395791 Well, that's that.
4395977 4398172 That guy was crazy.
4404903 4407417 He's gone.
4409866 4412334 Oh, no!
4414746 4416384 Get him!
4433556 4436389 Right here! H-Here, help me!<br />Help me! He's tryin' to kill me!
4441272 4442944 Jesus Christ!
4458998 4461148 Hey!
4493948 4496587 You're all going to die.
4510798 4513517 Get the fuck outta here!
4549420 4552218 Guess it's not a good day<br />to be a bad guy, huh, Skank?
4552423 4558452 I'm not Skank.<br />There's Skank right there. Skank's dead.
4558804 4561364 That's right.
4568647 4573515 - What in the crap...<br />- Don't move! Hold it!
4573819 4577094 That's all she wrote.<br />Move and we shoot!
4585121 4589034 <i>You are surrounded by police units.</i><br /><i>Do not attempt to escape.</i>
4592670 4595628 <i>- Stop running immediately.</i><br />- Holy shit!
4595840 4598400 <i>... spread your arms and legs...</i>
4604057 4608652 <i>Stop immediately.</i><br /><i>Lie down, spread your arms and legs...</i>
4651770 4653999 Come on! Move it!
4659069 4661536 My advice: Next time duck.
4663698 4665928 So many cops, you'd think<br />they were giving away doughnuts.
4669537 4671255 Shit!
4676961 4679429 I knew you were going to do that.
4679631 4684545 Look at that out there. The whole<br />city oughta be in flames by now.
4684844 4687119 The sky oughta be red.
4687305 4691456 So that, I take it,<br />is the late, great Eric Draven.
4691725 4697163 He has power, but it is power<br />you can take from him.
4697482 4699199 I like him already.
4699358 4702350 The crow is his link...
4702570 4707199 between the land of the living<br />and the realm of the dead.
4707491 4711848 So kill the crow<br />and destroy the man.
4737979 4740334 I'm coming home, Shelly.
4788905 4792658 You're gonna say<br />I shouldn't be in the cemetery<br />in the middle of the night. Right?
4792908 4797504 - The safest place in the world to be.<br />- That's 'cause everybody's dead.
4797788 4800700 I knew you'd come here.
4800916 4803191 It's really late, Sarah.
4803377 4806413 You didn't say goodbye.
4806630 4810509 You're just gonna have to<br />forgive me for that.
4810759 4813067 And you're never coming back.
4821353 4824425 I gave this to Shelly once.
4828276 4831109 I think she'd like you to have it.
4835284 4838036 This way you'll always remember her.
4838244 4841361 I'll never take it off.
4858764 4862040 I'd better go sneak back in the house.
4869233 4871986 Bye.
4890754 4892984 Shh. Shh.
4894759 4897272 Shh. Take it easy, sweetheart.
4904352 4906706 Come on. Come on.
4920783 4924059 What is that, some sort of souvenir<br />there from your pal?
4926248 4928807 I'll just keep it for good luck.<br />What do you say? Hmm?
4935298 4938529 Her eyes are so innocent.
4950271 4953343 Eric! Eric, help! Eric!
4996399 4998594 Quick impression for you.
4998777 5002247 Caw! Caw! Bang!<br />Fuck, I'm dead!
5002489 5005685 Give me the girl,<br />and I'll let you walk out of here.
5007911 5012028 Well, well. Why don't you just give me<br />a minute to think about that, huh?
5021716 5023752 Nah. Fuck it.
5032310 5035028 Aw, fuck.
5041111 5044182 Well, well, well, it does seem to me<br />that our little life...
5044405 5047283 has undergone a rather significant<br />change in the past few minutes.
5047492 5050483 Now wouldn't you agree?
5053664 5056939 Well, for a ghost<br />you bleed just fine.
5060629 5062779 - It's still alive.<br />- Well, then kill it.
5064966 5067241 Bye-bye, birdie.
5111846 5113677 Aw, shit.
5113848 5117999 Well, I just came by<br />to pay my respects, and here you are<br />gettin' all shot up again.
5118269 5120737 - They've taken Sarah.<br />- How many?
5120938 5123247 Two more.
5123441 5126238 - I can handle it. Don't worry.<br />- I'm not worried.
5126443 5130197 Look, here's the plan. You stay in<br />front, and when they run out of ammo,<br />I'll arrest 'em.
5130448 5134076 That sounds like a great plan.<br />There's just one problem.
5136579 5139696 Oh, shit.<br />You're bleedin' all over the place.
5139916 5142429 I thought, you know,<br />you were invincible.
5142626 5145936 I was. I'm not any more.
5147340 5151298 Well, I guess you really will<br />need my help, won't you? Come on.
5156222 5158019 You take that.
5188171 5191481 - You were supposed to stay behind me.<br />- I think I messed up.
5215740 5221496 This is all the power you ever had.<br />Now it is mine.
5221829 5225537 Pity there is not more time...
5225791 5227543 for us.
5245728 5248480 Help me!<br />Eric, I'm scared!
5251316 5253625 Let me go!
5262869 5265747 Let her go!
5267332 5270448 You can have me.<br />I won't fight you.
5271878 5273994 - All right.<br />- No!
5320676 5322553 Eric!
5341696 5344449 - Sarah?<br />- Look out!
5350497 5352806 Eric!
5359714 5364070 You know, my daddy used to say,<br />"Every man's got a devil...
5364344 5366539 and you can't rest till you find him."
5366721 5372238 Whatever happened back there<br />with you and your girlfriend,<br />I cleared that building.
5372560 5375836 Hell, nothin' in this town<br />happens without my say-so.
5376064 5379180 So I'm sorry if I spoiled<br />your wedding plans there, friend.
5379400 5382278 But if it's any consolation to you...
5382487 5385558 you have put a smile on my face.
5385781 5390809 You got a lot of spirit, son.<br />I am gonna miss you.
5391120 5395397 I have something to give you.<br />I don't want it any more.

5405426 5407985 All at once!
5410013 5411890 All for you.
5436832 5438662 Yeah.
5446841 5449514 Go help him.
5453597 5457033 Are you alive?
5459145 5461453 God, I need a cigarette.
5467237 5470273 - Everybody else dead?<br />- You helped me.
5471741 5474050 What you kept in here saved me.
5474243 5477200 - Thanks.<br />- Don't mention it.
5477413 5480564 I've been meaning to<br />come to church anyway.
5485420 5488969 Oh, yuck.
5489216 5493128 I'm quitting as of now, if I live.
5502729 5505084 Stay with him until help comes.
5505274 5509186 He'll be okay, right?
5509444 5512277 Eric?
5513824 5516132 He does that a lot.
5532258 5534567 Shelly.
5552778 5555656 - At least it stopped raining, huh?<br />- It can't rain all the time.
5555865 5559904 No, I don't believe it.<br />This nightmare your fault, Albrecht?
5560160 5563072 - Look, you go on home. I'm okay.<br />- Okay.
5563289 5566679 - You wanna tell me what's going on?<br />- Your vigilante's up on the roof.
5568835 5572874 - You missed it.<br />- Get him out of here.
5637361 5639670 Thanks.
5644618 5647769 If the people we love<br />are stolen from us...
5647997 5652387 the way to have them live on<br />is to never stop loving them.
5652668 5655580 Buildings burn, people die...
5655796 5658105 but real love is forever.
