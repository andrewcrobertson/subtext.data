366616 368889 I think I see him!
383300 385152 This way!
488863 490739 - Five.<br />- Oh, great.
490740 492240 So you got an arrow<br />right in your chest.
492241 493776 - And you're out 10 melee rounds.<br />- Oh, no.
493777 495285 Don't worry about it,<br />Mike. I got resurrection.
495286 498831 I'm already one of the undead.<br />I can still throw death spells.
498832 501208 I'm just trying to help you out,<br />man. Don't be so cranky.
501209 503460 How about throwing a<br />spell over the pizza man?
503461 505838 Where's our pizza, man?
505839 508215 Well, I'm ready now to play.
508216 510342 I'm ready to play now, you guys.
510343 513762 We're in the middle, Elliott. You can't<br />just join any universe in the middle.
513763 515785 I got him! I got him!
516016 517641 What am I asking for?
520770 522438 - Yeah.<br />- Mike?
522439 524882 I know. It's not for us,<br />it's for his mother.
525775 527501 Mike?
528153 530279 - Papa-oom-mow-mow.<br />- You have to ask Steve. He's game master.
530280 532114 He has absolute power.
532115 535594 - Steve?<br />- Steve, can I play now?
535618 537286 Go wait for the pizza first.
537287 539038 - Then I'm in?<br />- Yeah, you're in.
539039 542609 Figure out your strategy.<br />You're playing after Greg.
543626 546003 Plenty of sausage and pepperonis.
546004 548447 Everything but the little fishies.
582832 584775 Harvey?
585293 587419 Harvey, is that you, boy?
593301 594676 Over here, you guys.
594677 597371 - Stop it.<br />- Sorry.
605939 607631 Harvey?
648565 650274 All's you can get is<br />those 40-year-olds.
650275 651942 How do you win this game anyway?
651943 654903 There's no winning. It's like<br />life. You don't win at life.
654904 655988 Money helps.
655989 659366 - Mom! Mom! There's something out...<br />- Where's the pizza?
659367 662870 Mom! Mom! There's something<br />out there! It's in the tool shed.
662871 665247 It threw the ball at me.
665248 667020 Quiet!
667417 669985 Nobody go out there.
673256 675382 Stop. Now, you guys<br />stay right here.
675383 678260 You stay here, Mom.<br />We'll check it out.
678261 680829 - And put those knives back!<br />- Come on, Mom!
681931 684249 It's okay, Elliott.
684642 687336 Let's go get the flashlight.
687937 690460 Hold it. Wait a minute.
691149 693609 Creeps. Creepy.
693610 695903 - What exactly did you see?<br />- It's dark out here.
695904 698598 In there.
699866 701809 It's scary.
704204 705621 Psst.
705622 707289 There's nothing in here.
707290 709082 The gate's open.
709083 711060 Look at these.
716507 718467 Coyote's come back again, Mom.
718468 720969 Okay, party's over.<br />Everybody, back inside now.
720970 722471 Get out. Hurry up.
722472 724431 Quick. Hurry up. Come on.
724432 726705 Tyler, give me that knife.
727810 730729 Oh, great. Nice one, Elliott.
730730 732147 It was an accident.
732148 735817 A pizza? Who said you<br />guys could order a pizza?
735818 737795 Him.
738029 740822 - In the house.<br />- You geek, man.
740823 743951 - But Mom, it was real. I swear.<br />- Douche bag.
743952 746600 No douche-bag<br />talk in my house.
811019 813667 Elliott, you're crazy.
940481 942298 Hello.
954328 956020 Hello?
1007548 1009716 What are you going<br />as for Halloween?
1009717 1011343 I'm not going to stupid Halloween.
1011344 1013595 Why don't you go as a goblin?
1013596 1014888 Shut up.
1014889 1017015 It's not that we don't<br />believe you, honey.
1017016 1019710 Well, it was real. I swear.
1021729 1023797 What are you going as, Gert?
1023856 1026675 I'm going as a cowgirl.
1026817 1029090 So what else is new?
1029612 1032572 - Maybe it was an iguana.<br />- It was no iguana.
1032573 1034074 Maybe a...
1034075 1035158 A...
1035159 1037744 You know how they say there<br />are alligators in the sewers?
1037745 1039955 Alligators in the sewers.
1039956 1043250 All we're trying to say is, maybe<br />you just probably imagined it.
1043251 1045126 I couldn't have imagined it.
1045127 1047212 Maybe it was a pervert or a<br />deformed kid or something.
1047213 1049565 A deformed kid.
1049757 1051883 Maybe an elf or a leprechaun.
1051884 1054177 It was nothing like that,<br />penis breath!
1054178 1056304 Elliott!
1056305 1058077 Sit down.
1061310 1063457 Dad would believe me.
1068234 1071212 Maybe you ought to call your<br />father and tell him about it.
1072238 1075011 I can't. He's in Mexico with Sally.
1085167 1088361 Where's Mexico?
1091799 1093616 Excuse me.
1098139 1100207 I'm going to kill you.
1102018 1104352 If you ever see it<br />again, whatever it is,
1104353 1106187 don't touch it. Just call me.
1106188 1108106 And we'll have somebody<br />come and take it away.
1108107 1110567 Like the dogcatcher?
1110568 1115639 They'll give it a lobotomy or do<br />experiments on it or something.
1116490 1118908 It's your turn to do<br />the dishes, fellas.
1118909 1121494 - I set and cleared.<br />- I set and cleared.
1121495 1123955 - I did breakfast.<br />- I did breakfast.
1127209 1128752 What's the matter, Mom?
1132089 1134532 He hates Mexico.
1134759 1139865 Damn it! Why don't you grow up? Think<br />how other people feel for a change.
1212336 1213461 Mom.
1213462 1215797 Mom. Mom!
1215798 1217524 Michael.
1222847 1224869 Michael. Mom.
1398272 1399873 Wow.
1541915 1544392 Okay, you're hot.
1544460 1546482 I'll be back.
1548422 1550673 Mary, can I back the car out?
1550674 1552901 Not one foot past the driveway.
1610901 1614721 You were outside last night waiting for<br />that thing to come back, weren't you?
1615989 1618717 Are you going to<br />live if I go to work?
1622621 1625690 Okay. No TV.
1634925 1636217 Come on.
1636218 1638386 Mommy, look what Michael did.
1638387 1639595 This and that...
1639596 1643325 I see them, Gert. And when<br />I catch him, I'll catch him.
1646395 1649089 Come on. Don't be afraid.
1649273 1652001 It's all right. Come on.
1652734 1654426 Come on.
1658949 1660846 Come on.
1661785 1665522 Come on.
1665914 1667857 Come on.
1675382 1677780 Do you talk?
1677801 1680369 You know, talk?
1681221 1683619 Me, human.
1683932 1685516 Boy.
1685517 1687209 Elliott.
1688395 1690479 Elliott.
1691690 1693633 Elliott.
1704661 1707538 Coke. See, we drink it.
1707539 1711814 It's a drink. You know, food?
1712211 1714629 These are toys.<br />These are little men.
1714630 1717006 This is Greedo.
1717007 1720176 And then, this is Hammerhead.
1720177 1723638 You see, this is Walrus Man.
1723639 1726867 And then this is Snaggletooth.
1727142 1731588 And this is Lando Calrissian. See?
1731980 1734148 And this is Boba Fett.
1734149 1737423 Look. They can even<br />have wars. Look at this.
1741698 1744346 And look. Fish.
1744618 1749894 The fish eat the fish food<br />and the shark eats the fish,
1750457 1753105 but nobody eats a shark.
1755003 1758339 See, this is Pez. Candy.
1758340 1760216 You see, you eat it.
1760217 1763427 You put the candy in here
1763428 1767431 and then when you lift up the head, the<br />candy comes out and you can eat it.
1767432 1769249 You want some?
1771812 1773688 This is a peanut.
1773689 1775022 You eat it.
1775023 1779298 But you can't eat this one<br />because this is fake.
1779361 1782113 This is money. You see?
1782114 1784782 We put the money in the peanut.
1784783 1786867 You see? Bank.
1786868 1788640 You see? And then,
1790038 1792081 this is a car.
1792082 1794650 This is what we get around in.
1794876 1797319 See? A car.
1800257 1803326 Hey! Hey! Wait a second.
1803552 1806530 No. You don't eat them.
1806805 1808702 Are you hungry?
1809725 1811793 I'm hungry.
1814688 1816335 Stay.
1819943 1822611 Stay. I'll be right here.
1824072 1827175 Okay? I'll be right here.
1827534 1829511 Harv!
1829911 1832138 He won't bite.
1834082 1835541 Come on, Harvey.
1842841 1844533 He'll like this.
1851641 1853288 This.
1854644 1856496 This.
1883799 1885742 Are you okay?
1888804 1891031 Too much excitement, huh?
1891348 1893120 Want a Coke?
1898397 1902775 <i>There are so many people to see</i>
1902776 1907738 <i>So many people you can check up<br />on and add to your collection</i>
1907739 1910157 <i>But they keep you hanging on</i>
1910158 1913160 Nothing but health shit.
1913161 1918267 <i>Add to your collection<br />But they keep you hanging on</i>
1923380 1924755 Mike, Mike, come in.
1924756 1926757 - How you feeling, faker?<br />- I'm feeling fine.
1926758 1928342 Look, I got something<br />really important...
1928343 1931679 Tyler said he got 69,000<br />on <i>Asteroids</i> yesterday.
1931680 1935033 - But he pulled the plug.<br />- Look, remember the goblin?
1935058 1936767 You're so lame, Elliott.
1936768 1939086 Come on, Michael. He came back.
1939813 1943566 He came back?
1943567 1944942 Oh, my God!
1944943 1947261 One thing.
1947654 1951591 I have absolute power.<br />Say it. Say it!
1951617 1953993 What have you got?<br />Is it the coyote?
1953994 1956688 No. Look...
1957998 1961125 Okay. Now, swear it.
1961126 1963669 The most excellent<br />promise you can make.
1963670 1967381 Swear as my only<br />brother on our lives.
1967382 1969341 Okay, don't get so heavy. I swear.
1969342 1972511 Okay. Stand over there.
1972512 1974326 And uh, you'd better take off...
1974352 1975836 - ...your shoulder pads.<br />- What?
1975862 1979481 You might scare him.<br />And close your eyes.
1979978 1981520 Don't push it, Elliott.
1981521 1984523 I'm not coming out there<br />until your eyes are closed.
1984524 1987172 Okay. They're closed.
1987235 1988903 Mom is going to kill you.
1991573 1995075 Okay. Swear it one more time.
1995076 1997903 - I have absolute power.<br />- You have absolute power.
1997904 1999681 Yes.
2009508 2013112 Elliott! Look what I made for you!
2018350 2021544 Stop! Stop!
2021895 2023395 Stop!
2029194 2030903 Kids, I'm home!
2030904 2032071 Guys?
2032072 2035366 - In the closet, fast.<br />- Anybody up there, kids?
2038453 2039954 Anybody home?
2039955 2042623 Hi, honey, how are you feel...
2042624 2045101 What happened in here?
2045794 2048442 Oh, you mean my room.
2049464 2051782 This is no room.
2051883 2053801 This is an accident.
2053802 2056345 I was reorganizing.
2056346 2057930 I can see that.
2057931 2060307 Put those shelves back<br />on the wall, dear.
2060308 2062226 Let's get the toys off the floor.
2062227 2065604 Make your bed since<br />you are not using it.
2065605 2067982 Well, you're feeling better, I see.
2067983 2071652 Will you guys keep an eye on Gertie<br />for me while I take a shower?
2071653 2073320 Absolutely.
2074906 2076632 Bye, Mom.
2086876 2088568 Elliott...
2088587 2090530 I'm keeping him.
2092841 2094943 What is it?
2095427 2098075 He won't hurt you, Gertie.
2098513 2101286 He won't hurt you, Gertie.
2101474 2103951 We're not going to hurt you.
2104519 2106937 Is he a boy or a girl?
2106938 2108915 He's a boy.
2111526 2114612 Was he wearing any clothes?
2114613 2116465 No.
2116573 2121349 But, look, you can't tell.<br />Not even Mom.
2121369 2122703 Why not?
2122704 2126274 Because grownups can't see him.
2126875 2129543 Only little kids can see him.
2129544 2131170 Give me a break.
2131171 2135007 Well, do you know<br />what's going to happen
2135008 2136985 if you do tell?
2139721 2141305 Do it, Mike. We have to.
2141306 2143057 No, please!
2143058 2145559 No! I'll do anything, please!
2145560 2148562 Gertie, help me! No, please!
2148563 2150230 Give it!
2150231 2152174 - Promise?<br />- Yes.
2152734 2154927 Do you promise?
2224139 2226140 What are you doing, Gert?
2226141 2229244 I'm going to play<br />in Elliott's room.
2230103 2232479 Okay. Don't let him torture you.
2232480 2234148 I won't, Mary.
2241072 2242448 Hello?
2242449 2244551 Jerry! Jerry!
2249956 2252604 Come on, come on. Hurry up.
2253084 2256233 Don't be pushy, pushy.
2259507 2261529 A plant for you.
2261843 2265012 Maybe he's some animal that<br />wasn't supposed to live.
2265013 2266805 You know, like those<br />rabbits we saw that time.
2266806 2268515 - Don't be lame.<br />- Green, orange, red.
2268516 2270350 Could be a monkey<br />or an orangutan...
2270351 2272019 A bald monkey?
2272020 2275464 Is he a pig? He sure eats like one.
2275565 2277963 You could make faces.
2278026 2283071 And make them mean and happy<br />and make them get sharp teeth.
2283072 2285174 We are here.
2285533 2288410 - We're here.<br />- No, use this.
2288411 2290496 You could make all sorts of things.
2290497 2293270 Okay. We're here.
2293374 2294666 We are here.
2294667 2296985 Where are you from?
2309182 2311099 I don't like his feet.
2311100 2313393 They're only feet,<br />you little twerp.
2313394 2316338 He's trying to tell us something.
2325573 2327265 Earth.
2328243 2330140 Home.
2330286 2331978 Home.
2332247 2333939 Home.
2370869 2372846 What's he doing?
2373580 2375682 What's happening?
2388261 2389908 Elliott.
2391973 2393745 Oh, no.
2407071 2408405 Elliott, what is it?
2408406 2410974 I don't know. Something scary.
2431137 2433660 - Got a pulse?<br />- No, boss.
2438227 2440545 Hold it. We got it right here.
2441522 2443248 Follow him.
2445526 2447628 You think this house?
2478059 2479393 Did you explain school to him?
2479394 2481895 How do you explain school<br />to higher intelligence?
2481896 2484064 Maybe he's not that smart.<br />Maybe he's a worker bee
2484065 2486400 - who only knows how to push buttons.<br />- He's too smart.
2486401 2489069 Okay, I just hope we don't<br />wake up on Mars or something,
2489070 2492264 surrounded by millions<br />of little squashy guys.
2499080 2500247 Hi, Elliott.
2500248 2502666 - Hey, Elliott, where's your goblin?<br />- Shut up.
2502667 2506195 - Did he come back?<br />- Well, did he?
2506237 2510590 Yeah, he came back. But he's<br />not a goblin. He's a spaceman.
2511876 2514094 As in extraterrestrial.
2514095 2515570 Where's he from? Uranus?
2515596 2517723 Get it? Your anus?
2517724 2520434 - He doesn't get it, Ty.<br />- Get it? Your anus?
2520435 2522602 - He doesn't get it.<br />- You're so immature.
2522603 2524271 And you're a sine supremus.
2524272 2527774 - Zero charisma.<br />- Sine supremus.
2527775 2529151 Shut up, Greg!
2529152 2531278 - Sine supremus.<br />- Zero charisma!
2531279 2533051 You wimp.
2542874 2544851 Let's go.
2547962 2551156 Come on. Get in the car.<br />We're gonna be late.
2594133 2598678 Okay, boys and girls, today we will<br />be doing the actual frog dissection
2598679 2601681 for which we've been preparing.
2601682 2606833 And you will find<br />many similarities.
2612652 2617803 As you get into the dissection, you<br />will discover that the anatomy...
2648062 2652212 The scalpel is very sharp.
2652400 2655652 Use discretion when<br />you are cutting.
2655653 2660679 There will be very little blood.<br />There may be a few body fluids.
2693357 2694958 Ugh.
2711959 2714961 As we get started with<br />the dissection...
2714962 2718429 - Ew!<br />- ...remember that the...
2718430 2721444 things that you are writing down...
2731812 2735815 One thing that you should be<br />looking for during the dissection
2735816 2740091 is to locate the heart and<br />notice that it is still beating.
2743574 2746451 I'm going to once more<br />emphasize the similarities
2746452 2749601 of those things which<br />we see in the...
2753626 2756604 Similarities with human anatomy...
2757380 2759130 First of all, here's the heart...
2765846 2771794 The intestines will be going<br />through their peristaltic action.
2772853 2776022 <i>X-W-V-U.</i>
2776023 2778900 <i>A-F-P.</i>
2778901 2782946 <i>That is incorrect. The correct<br />spelling of nuisance is</i>
2782947 2788804 N-U-I-S-A-N-C-E.
2795042 2796689 <i>They're pulling us up.</i>
2802425 2806803 Class, these are the cotton<br />balls with the chloroform.
2806804 2811808 And as soon as I get them all in, be<br />sure and put the lid on right away.
2811809 2813810 - Ew!<br />- That's it.
2813811 2816834 That will start them<br />going to sleep.
2820192 2823921 And they won't feel anything.<br />They won't be hurt.
2825740 2827967 It'll take a little while.
2828200 2831494 If you don't want to watch<br />them, you don't have to.
2850473 2852495 Say hi.
2853225 2855122 Can you talk?
2855227 2857249 Can you say hi?
2881962 2883088 <i>Hello.</i>
2883089 2884672 <i>Uncle Ralph!</i>
2884673 2887592 <i>It's Uncle Ralph, long<br />distance from California!</i>
2887593 2890345 <i>I'll talk fast. This call<br />must be expensive.</i>
2890346 2893681 <i>No, no, no, no. If I call anytime<br />on Saturday without an operator,</i>
2893682 2896434 <i>I can talk for five minutes<br />for 85 cents plus tax.</i>
2896435 2899062 <i>If I talk less, I pay less.</i>
2899063 2900855 <i>Let me talk to that little fella.</i>
2900856 2903066 <i>Lou, it's Uncle Ralph.</i>
2903067 2904964 <i>Hello, Uncle Ralph.</i>
2923504 2925105 Hmm.
2925589 2927532 Save him.
2934265 2937434 Run for your life! Back to the<br />river! Back to the forest!
2937435 2940937 Run! I want to save you!
2940938 2943540 Let's get out of here!
2945818 2947318 Get out!
2947319 2949637 I got to let him go!
2956370 2958768 You've got to save him!
2983355 2985023 Let me handle this!
2985024 2988735 Class. Let me handle this!<br />I can handle this.
2988736 2990588 Let me get this.
3043916 3046376 <i>Grandpa, what's wrong?</i>
3046377 3049629 <i>I'm afraid Betsy Sue isn't<br />going to run tomorrow.</i>
3049630 3052298 <i>Oh, no. Is it anything serious?</i>
3052299 3055527 Harvey, I'm home. Come here, boy.
3066689 3068106 Here he is.
3068107 3069816 Here's who?
3069817 3073152 The man from the moon, but I<br />think you've killed him already.
3073153 3076427 Honey, just as soon<br />as I unload the stuff, okay?
3082162 3084014 Med-bugs.
3085457 3087625 I want you to meet somebody.
3087626 3089961 This stuff has gone up<br />so much in one week.
3089962 3091504 I want you to meet somebody.
3091505 3095735 Okay, honey, as soon as I finish<br />putting all this stuff away, all right?
3097678 3099279 Oh!
3106020 3109043 Stupid ragu. I knew it<br />wouldn't come out.
3111150 3112817 - "B."<br />- "B."
3112818 3114965 What's with this?
3117906 3119678 Hello.
3120659 3122535 Yeah, this is she.
3122536 3123911 "Basket."
3123912 3125038 "Bandit."
3125039 3126581 "Ball."
3126582 3129480 "Basket. Bandit. Ball."
3129835 3131544 "Bugs."
3131545 3133271 "Bananas?
3133922 3136069 Intoxicated?
3140638 3143097 You sure you have<br />the right Elliott?
3143098 3145371 "B. B."
3145809 3148286 - "Biscuits."<br />- B.
3149146 3150438 <i>But "B" is for boy...</i>
3150439 3151814 B.
3151815 3154292 <i>with a baseball and bat.</i>
3155194 3157262 You said "B."
3157321 3159013 B.
3159073 3161846 You said "B." Good.
3162451 3164519 B.
3165037 3166954 Good.
3166955 3170767 Okay, I'll be right down.<br />Thank you. Ooh...
3171710 3174253 Gertie, I have to<br />go pick up Elliott.
3174254 3177340 - Will you be a good girl...<br />- Mommy, he can talk.
3177341 3181177 Of course he can talk. I'll be right<br />back in 10 minutes. Stay there.
3181178 3186224 <i>Ladies and gentlemen, little<br />Grover here will demonstrate</i>

3206286 3208934 You want to call somebody?
3209790 3212313 I am not paying for frogs.
3212376 3215399 Be good. Be good.
3216088 3218339 Stay here. Stay.
3218340 3222035 And don't tell anybody. Nobody.

3233564 3235481 Oh, God!
3235482 3237442 - Elliott.<br />- What?
3237443 3240486 Elliott.
3240487 3244323 I taught him how to<br />talk now. He can talk now.
3244324 3245450 Elliott!
3245451 3247827 Look what he brought<br />up here all by himself.
3247828 3248870 Elliott.
3248871 3250329 What's he need this stuff for?
3250330 3252648 Elliott. Elliott.
3253375 3254709 E.T. Can you say that?
3254710 3256794 Can you say E.T.?

3263302 3264677 Be good.
3264678 3266971 "Be good." I taught him that, too.
3266972 3268848 You should give him his dignity.
3268849 3271952 This is the most ridiculous<br />thing I've ever seen!
3272144 3274371 Phone.
3275230 3277023 Phone?
3277024 3280401 He said "phone"?
3280402 3284381 Can't you understand<br />English? He said "phone."

3374913 3376289 I guess we should just<br />grab anything that
3376290 3378791 looks like he could make<br />a machine out of.
3378792 3381127 What would make a radar?
3381128 3383796 How the hell do I know?<br />You're the genius here.
3383797 3386549 You have absolute power, remember?
3386550 3389323 "I found him. He belongs to me."
3402566 3404588 You know, Elliott,
3405319 3409640 - he doesn't look too good anymore.<br />- Don't say that! We're fine!
3409781 3412099 What's all this "we" stuff?
3412242 3415127 <i>You say "we" all the time<br />now. Really, Elliott...</i>
3415128 3417163 <i>- ...I think he may be getting sick.<br />- Look, he's fine.</i>

3436934 3440102 Remember when he used to<br />take us out to the ball games
3440103 3444128 and take us to the movies,<br />and we'd have popcorn fights?
3444775 3448299 <i>- We'll do that again, Elliott.<br />- Sure.</i>

3594049 3596322 He's putting it together now.
3596510 3599553 - I told you he was smart.<br />- I'm worried, Elliott.
3599554 3601305 He could blow up the whole house.
3601306 3602765 He knows what he's doing.
3602766 3605835 Listen to how he's breathing.
3605852 3608020 It's going to work.

3646351 3648102 Meet you at the lookout.
3648103 3651230 At the lookout. I'm not<br />stupid, you know.

4351931 4355308 My husband and I just<br />separated recently
4355309 4360230 and it hasn't been easy<br />on the children, but...
4360231 4363050 My father's in Mexico.
4369073 4371220 But run away, I...
4371534 4373535 Where would he have gone?
4373536 4374953 Elliott.
4374954 4377306 Oh, Elliott!
4378124 4381068 Don't ever do this again, Elliott!
4381961 4385235 Oh, my. You're so hot.
4385965 4388784 Run up and draw him<br />a bath. Quick, Gert.
4389260 4391783 Sorry I yelled at you.
4394599 4397517 Thanks very much<br />for all your trouble.
4397518 4399586 Is he here?
4401314 4404963 - You've got to find him, Mike.<br />- Where is he?
4405318 4407652 In the forest.
4407653 4409846 At the bald spot.
4410281 4412599 You've got to find him.
4462875 4464818 E.T.!
4467713 4469565 E.T.!
4471717 4473318 E.T.!
4511924 4515364 No!
4545291 4548189 Mom, would you come with me?
4548252 4549753 What is it?
4549754 4551838 Mary, just come with me.
4551839 4553798 Michael, what?
4553799 4557093 - Mom, remember the goblin?<br />- Michael, what are you talking about?
4557094 4559596 Just swear the most excellent<br />promise you can make.
4559597 4561574 Michael.
4567438 4569381 That's terrific.
4575279 4577973 Mom.
4582787 4584604 We're sick.
4587208 4589310 I think we're dying.
4592838 4595440 - Michael.<br />- Mom, it's okay.
4596801 4598343 Downstairs.
4598344 4601304 He's not going to hurt you, Mom.
4601305 4602639 He's not gonna hurt you.
4602640 4604224 Michael, get her downstairs.
4604225 4606184 It's the man from the moon.
4606185 4609413 The man from the moon!
4612274 4615276 You don't know him!<br />You don't know him!
4619907 4622117 We can't leave him alone.
4660781 4663509 This is my home!
4711957 4714059 Home.
4715211 4716903 Home.
4756752 4761323 <i>The collagen unit, report to<br />the blue level immediately.</i>
4793872 4796708 - Does he sleep at night?<br />- I don't know. I don't know.
4796709 4798936 What's the matter with Elliott?
4799336 4801629 Have you noticed any<br />surface sweating?
4801630 4802380 No.
4802381 4805425 - Has it lost any hair?<br />- He never had any hair.
4805426 4807343 - Are the children all right?<br />- Yes.
4807344 4810805 Did it ever build anything<br />or write anything down?
4810806 4811973 Uh... No.
4811974 4816249 Would you say it has the ability<br />to manipulate its own environment?
4816395 4820044 He's smart. He communicates<br />through Elliott.
4820065 4822567 Elliott thinks its thoughts.
4822568 4826889 No. Elliott feels his feelings.
4830451 4833369 We've identified his primary carrier<br />protein by electrophoresis.
4833370 4834620 It's definitely not albumin.
4834621 4837915 Testing shows no deficit.<br />Some F&F. HTS test...
4837916 4840001 EEG analysis shows<br />complete coherence
4840002 4842754 and synchronization of brainwave<br />activity between both subjects.
4842755 4844088 Skin biopsy reveals<br />9 millimetres of...
4844089 4845381 <i>Read isotonic.</i>
4845382 4848092 <i>Nitrates. 255 million equivalent.</i>
4848093 4850595 Better do IV and oral contrast.
4850596 4853765 If there's no response, let's<br />move to hypertonic saline.
4853766 4855183 We have meta-starch available.
4855184 4856642 Cut five per kilo.
4856643 4857810 CVP line could help.
4857811 4860789 I think you get more<br />information with this one gain.
4861899 4867005 You have no right to do this.<br />You're scaring him.
4867404 4869113 You're scaring him!
4869114 4870323 Respiratory rate, 12.
4870324 4872825 Good air entry but decreased<br />tidal volume on the boy.
4872826 4876662 Put him on O2 five litres by nasal cannula<br />and draw blood gas in 20 minutes.
4876663 4878790 Temperature's dropped from<br />20 to 17 degrees centigrade.
4878791 4880416 Get a hypothermia blanket...
4880417 4883065 Please leave him alone.
4883670 4886714 Can you leave him alone?<br />I can take care of him.
4886715 4889342 Get a Doppler-scope in here and<br />set me up for a 2D cardiac echo.
4889343 4892136 Skin is cool and diaphoretic.
4892137 4894806 He's not refusing at all.<br />He needs inotropic support.
4894807 4898877 PH is down to 7.03. He's<br />got metabolic acidosis.
4899478 4901312 It could be sepsis.
4901313 4903106 We've drawn two sets<br />of blood cultures.
4903107 4906927 He needs broad-spectrum coverage.<br />How about amp, gen, flagyl?
4914118 4916095 Elliott.
4918163 4920606 I've been to the forest.
4921166 4923484 He shouldn't talk now.
4923502 4926275 Well, he has to talk now, Major.
4928924 4932903 Elliott, that machine,<br />what does it do?
4934471 4937073 The communicator?
4938350 4941102 Is it still working?
4941103 4943455 It's doing something.
4944523 4946215 What?
4946692 4949215 I really shouldn't tell.
4949778 4954637 He came to me.
4955284 4958933 Elliott, he came to me, too.
4959538 4963642 I've been wishing for this<br />since I was 10 years old.
4963792 4966269 I don't want him to die.
4966587 4969736 What can we do that<br />we're not already doing?
4970174 4973493 He needs to go home.
4974595 4977323 He's calling his people
4978348 4981576 and I don't know where they are.
4982269 4984917 He needs to go home.
4985564 4990044 Elliott, I don't think that he<br />was left here intentionally.
4992488 4996058 But his being here<br />is a miracle, Elliott.
4996700 4998677 It's a miracle.
4999745 5003189 And you did the best<br />that anybody could do.
5006168 5008736 I'm glad he met you first.
5017596 5020290 - He's got DNA.<br />- Incredible.
5020599 5022016 - He's got DNA.<br />- What?
5022017 5024435 He doesn't have four nucleotides<br />like we do. He has six.
5024436 5027146 I've got de-synchronization of<br />the two brainwave activities.
5027147 5028964 What are they?
5030275 5031567 E.T.!
5031568 5035172 The boy's condition is stabilizing.<br />His blood pressure's coming back up.
5035948 5038346 E.T.
5039117 5041264 Elliott.
5041578 5043371 - He's speaking.<br />- He's talking.
5043372 5047476 E.T., stay with me.
5049294 5050419 Please.
5050420 5052296 Stay.
5052297 5054149 Together.
5054967 5057740 I'll be right here.
5057844 5060412 I'll be right here.
5062474 5065327 Stay.
5065602 5069502 Elliott.
5070023 5072250 Stay.
5073402 5076130 Stay.
5078657 5080759 Stay.
5081827 5083703 Stay.
5083704 5087164 The creature's pressure is bottoming out.<br />His complexes are slow and widening.
5087165 5089500 How's the boy?
5089501 5092775 He's converting back to<br />normal sinus rhythm.
5093338 5094337 They're separating.
5094338 5096716 - Yes, definitely separating.<br />- Boy and creature are separating.
5096717 5099623 - What does that mean?<br />- The boy's coming back.
5099624 5100678 We're losing E.T.
5100679 5104078 E.T., answer me, please.
5104141 5106914 - Everything is going to be fine.<br />- Please.
5106935 5108878 Just relax.
5175921 5177004 No!
5177005 5178839 E.T., don't go!
5178840 5182193 - No blood pressure.<br />- He's got no pulse or respiration.
5183762 5185846 We can't get a pulse or blood<br />pressure on the creature.
5185847 5188324 It doesn't look like<br />he's breathing.
5191478 5195189 Leave him alone!<br />You're killing him!
5195190 5196857 Leave him alone!
5196858 5198859 Let's move it!
5198860 5200736 Get the boy out of<br />here. Get him away.
5200737 5205137 Stop it! You're killing him!<br />You're killing him!
5206868 5210204 You're killing him!<br />You're killing him!
5210205 5213183 You're killing him! He came to me!
5213709 5215710 Any pulses? Any pulses?
5215711 5217984 - Okay, let's go.<br />- He came to me!
5223135 5225453 Minimal breath sounds.
5226513 5229536 Calm down. Calm down. Calm...
5230475 5234625 Let's try some bretylium. Can<br />we have some bretylium, please?
5235605 5236814 Getting a pulse?
5236815 5239588 Compressed air.<br />Compressed air's fine.
5240026 5241627 Thank you.
5241695 5242862 All IV push.
5242863 5244715 He's not ventilating.
5245323 5247324 His pupils are fixed and dilated.
5247325 5248451 How about some more drugs?
5248452 5249577 Quiet.
5249578 5251851 Defibrillate him.
5255041 5257835 - Everybody, stand clear.<br />- Clear.
5257836 5259211 We're losing him.
5259212 5261029 One more time.
5262466 5264425 Quiet.
5264426 5265926 - It's still v-fib.<br />- Okay, let's go.
5265927 5267949 Okay. Let's go. Let's go.
5269973 5271790 Quiet.
5274978 5276875 Elliott?
5278023 5279795 Mom.
5289701 5291035 Try calcium.
5291036 5293037 He needs some calcium in his body.
5293038 5295265 Let's continue CPR, please.
5310263 5312831 Would you people stand back?
5317604 5319956 Something's happening.
5320148 5322566 - Ooh, they're going to die.<br />- Shut up, Greg.
5322567 5324735 Something is definitely happening.
5324736 5327071 - Anybody have any ideas?<br />- EKG's flat.
5327072 5330221 - EKG's flat.<br />- Okay, I'm going to call it.
5331660 5333410 - I think he's dead.<br />- No. I don't know.
5333411 5335579 All right. I'm calling it.<br />What time do you have?
5335580 5336914 1536.
5336915 5339768 15 hours, 36 minutes.
5339918 5341861 Okay.
5341920 5344363 Let's pack him in ice.
5344589 5346862 Let's leave.
5412741 5414888 Is he dead, Mama?
5415493 5417766 I think so, sweetheart.
5417787 5420606 Can we wish for him to come back?
5421833 5423626 Yeah.
5423627 5425649 I wish.
5426004 5428106 I wish, too.
5437098 5441123 Come on, Gert. We'll wait for<br />Elliott in the front room.
5442687 5447650 Cardiac arrest was terminated<br />at 1500 hours and 36 minutes.
5447651 5453364 He received intravenous lidocaine,<br />intravenous epinephrine, a lidocaine drip,
5453365 5457868 2.7% sodium-chloride solution,<br />catheters from the "A" line.
5457869 5462331 And the intravenous line<br />should be sent for culture.
5462332 5468379 He was monitored with<br />an EEG and an EKG.
5468380 5470297 He was defibrillated...
5470298 5472633 They're going to have<br />to take him away now.
5472634 5475612 They're just gonna cut him all up.
5477555 5481250 Would you like to spend<br />some time alone with him?
5496157 5499510 Could we all step out<br />for a minute, please?
5553423 5556321 Look at what they've done to you.
5558636 5560658 I'm so sorry.
5566311 5568504 You must be dead
5570190 5574920 because I don't know how to feel.
5577989 5580842 I can't feel anything anymore.
5583578 5586431 You've gone someplace else now.
5594214 5597112 I'll believe in you all my life.
5598343 5600365 Every day.
5604682 5606499 E.T.,
5609062 5611209 I love you.
5642095 5644447 Oh, my God.
5650603 5653063 E.T. phone home.
5653064 5656733 Home. Phone home.
5656734 5658610 Phone home.
5658611 5660696 Does this mean they're coming?

5667912 5669371 Stay.

5688558 5691957 Elliott. Elliott. Elliott.
5694522 5696590 Elliott?
5705158 5707726 - Elliott?<br />- No.
5708119 5712314 - Elliott, why don't you come with me?<br />- No. No.
5713291 5715564 - It's all right.<br />- No, no.
5718213 5720631 It'll be all right.
5720632 5723451 Would you like the flowers?
5726804 5730140 He's alive! He's alive!
5743905 5746281 Are they gone, Mama?
5746282 5748575 - Who's gone, honey?<br />- The boys.
5748576 5750348 What boys?
5750370 5754270 I'm supposed to give you<br />this note when they're gone.
5755667 5757985 Give it to me now, Gertie.
5764968 5767286 Oh, my God.
5775687 5778164 Give me a hand with this.
5785655 5787864 - Where's your mask?<br />- It's back here.
5787865 5790388 - Well, get it on!<br />- I'm trying!
5796541 5799189 Hey, who are you?
5799294 5801521 I'm driving.
5802422 5804089 Open the door, son.
5804090 5806216 There's a guy out here.<br />What do I do?
5806217 5808990 What are you waiting for? Let's go!
5809220 5811388 Well, let's get out<br />of here, Michael!
5811389 5814808 I've never driven forward before!
5823026 5826069 Get the bikes. Meet us at the<br />playground at the top of the hill.
5826070 5827922 Let's do it!
5829115 5832844 Come on, Michael! Go, go, go!
5847925 5851261 We're all gonna die, and they're<br />never gonna give me my license.
5854098 5857809 - Where's the playground?<br />- It's near the preschool!
5857810 5860420 - Where's that?<br />- I don't know streets.
5860421 5862761 Mom always drives me.
5862982 5864900 Son of a bitch.
5890343 5893637 - Where are you going?<br />- To the spaceship.
5893638 5897682 - Spaceship?<br />- To the spaceship to the moon.
5897683 5899751 Quiet!
5900770 5902667 Oh, my God.
5903022 5905340 Stop the van!
5908486 5910884 Don't pull them off!
5923918 5925940 That did it!
5973718 5978664 Okay. He's a man from outer space<br />and we're taking him to his spaceship.
5978723 5981141 Well, can't he just beam up?
5981142 5983415 This is reality, Greg.
5985396 5986897 - Keep her back!<br />- No!
5986898 5990817 - Hold her back!<br />- No guns! They're children!
5990818 5993653 No! No! No!
5993654 5995405 - Where are they?<br />- No!
5995406 5997724 There's nobody here.
6004832 6006249 Where are we going?
6006250 6008168 To the forest!
6010922 6012819 Follow me!
6044872 6047224 We got them, at the<br />bottom of the hill.
6062848 6064516 This is Unit 302.
6064517 6068462 We've cut the kids off at the bottom<br />of the hill. Send backup units.
6092587 6094337 Let's split up.
6094338 6095939 Okay!
6103764 6105957 Hang on!
6126078 6129147 We made it! Oh, shit!
6154899 6157342 - Whoa!<br />- Whoa!
6168537 6171060 Tell me when it's over!
6223134 6224735 Ah.
