499198 501072 - Five.<br />- Great.
501158 503910 You got an arrow right in your chest.
503995 505904 Don't worry. I got resurrection.
505997 507539 I'm already one of the undead.
507623 509497 I can still throw death spells.
509584 511375 Just trying to help you out, man.
511461 513750 How about throwing a spell over the pizza man?
513838 515831 Where's our pizza, man?
516174 518500 I'm ready as of now to play.
518719 520758 I'm ready to play now, you guys.
520846 523966 We're in the middle, Elliott.<br />You can't join in the middle.
524058 525433 I got him!
526226 527721 What am I asking for?
527811 531097 Papa-oom-mow-mow.<br />Papa-oom-mow-mow.
531899 533014 Mike?
533192 535101 It's not for us, it's for his mother.
536195 537358 Mike?
538364 542362 Ask Steve. He's game master.<br />He has absolute power.
542452 543401 Steve?
543495 545452 Steve, can I play now?
545872 547497 Go wait for the pizza first.
547582 549242 Then I'm in?<br />You're in.
549334 552419 Figure out your strategy.<br />You're playing after Greg.
553964 556289 Plenty of sausage and pepperonis.
556383 558709 Everything but the little fishies.
593047 594506 Harvey?
595341 597417 Harvey, is that you, boy?
603642 605052 Over here, you guys.
605143 606887 Stop it.<br />Sorry.
616197 617228 Harvey?
658741 662241 All's you get is those 40-year-olds.<br />How do you win this game?
663079 665405 It's like life. You don't win at life.<br />Money helps.
666333 668575 Mom! There's something out...
668669 670211 Where's the pizza?
670295 673166 There's something out there!<br />In the toolshed.
673257 675546 It threw the ball at me.
675634 676832 Quiet!
677762 679801 Nobody go out there.
683518 685843 Stop. Now, you guys stay right here.
685937 688143 You stay here, Mom. We'll check it out.
688231 690473 And put those knives back!
692777 694188 It's okay, Elliott.
694279 696438 Let's go get the flashlight.
698200 700193 Hold it. Wait a minute.
701286 703493 Creeps. Creepy.
703581 705704 What exactly did you see?
706083 707162 In there.
709962 711421 It's scary.
715760 717338 There's nothing in here.
717429 718887 The gate's open.
719264 720758 Look at these.
726772 728681 Coyote's come back again, Mom.
728774 731395 Okay, party's over.<br />Everybody, back inside now.
731485 732860 Get out. Hurry up.
732945 734225 Quick. Hurry up.
734655 736447 Tyler, give me that knife.
738576 740782 Great. Nice one, Elliott.
740870 742364 It was an accident.
743247 746118 Who said you guys could order a pizza?
746209 747620 Him.
748336 750744 In the house.<br />You geek, man.
751006 752417 Mom, it was real.
753091 754170 Douche bag.
754259 757094 No douche-bag talk in my house.
821163 822788 Elliott, you're crazy.
950884 952342 Hello.
964606 965769 Hello?
1017871 1019994 What are you going as for Halloween?
1020082 1023581 - I'm not going to stupid Halloween.<br />- Go as a goblin.
1023836 1025164 Shut up.
1025254 1027412 It's not that we don't believe you, honey.
1027506 1029463 Well, it was real. I swear.
1032094 1034217 What are you going as, Gert?
1034305 1036677 I'm going as a cowgirl.
1036891 1039180 So what else is new?
1040019 1043020 - Maybe it was an iguana.<br />- It was no iguana.
1043106 1044565 Maybe a...
1045233 1048021 You know how they say<br />there are alligators in the sewers?
1048111 1050069 Alligators in the sewers.
1050280 1053649 All we're trying to say is,<br />maybe you imagined it.
1053742 1055367 I couldn't have.
1055452 1059581 - Maybe it was a pervert or a deformed kid.<br />- A deformed kid.
1060124 1062283 Maybe an elf or a leprechaun.
1062376 1064369 It was nothing like that, penis breath!
1064462 1066122 Elliott!
1066547 1068291 Sit down.
1071594 1073338 Dad would believe me.
1078560 1081894 Maybe you ought to call your father<br />and tell him about it.
1082439 1085275 I can't. He's in Mexico with Sally.
1096412 1098488 Where's Mexico?
1102002 1103330 Excuse me.
1108425 1110334 I'm going to kill you.
1112262 1115014 If you see it again, whatever it is,<br />don't touch it.
1115099 1118183 Just call me.<br />We'll have somebody take it away.
1118644 1120767 Like the dogcatcher?
1120855 1122764 They'll give it a lobotomy...
1122857 1125858 ...or do experiments on it or something.
1126653 1128895 Your turn to do the dishes.
1129072 1131361 - I set and cleared.<br />- I did.
1131449 1134450 I did breakfast.<br />I did breakfast.
1137623 1139331 What's the matter, Mom?
1142419 1144293 He hates Mexico.
1145130 1147456 Damn it! Why don't you grow up?
1147550 1150634 Think how other people feel for a change.
1222629 1223708 Ma...
1223797 1224828 Mom.
1224923 1226002 Mom.
1226091 1227289 Michael.
1232973 1234136 Michael.
1234225 1235423 Mom.
1408325 1409606 Wow!
1552186 1554095 Okay, you're hot.
1554772 1556314 I'll be back.
1558859 1562608 Mary, can I back the car out?<br />Not one foot past the driveway.
1621384 1625548 You were outside last night<br />waiting for that thing, weren't you?
1626389 1628761 Are you going to live if I go to work?
1632938 1634136 Okay.
1634439 1635815 No TV.
1645326 1646654 Come on.
1646744 1648535 Mommy, look what Michael did.
1648621 1649617 This and...

1694127 1695041 Boy.
1695796 1697041 Elliott.
1698632 1700708 Elliott.
1702094 1703553 Elliott.
1714983 1717521 Coke. See, we drink it.
1717610 1719520 It's a drink.
1719779 1721689 You know, food?
1722657 1725030 These are toys. Little men.
1725285 1727408 This is Greedo.
1727496 1730616 And then this is Hammerhead.
1730958 1733496 You see, this is Walrus Man.
1733586 1736836 And then this is Snaggletooth.
1737340 1739913 And this is Lando Calrissian.
1740301 1741464 See?
1742178 1744337 And this is Boba Fett.
1744514 1747183 Look. They can even have wars.
1752105 1754228 And look. Fish.
1754900 1757473 The fish eat the fish food...
1757903 1760192 ...and the shark eats the fish...
1760656 1762779 ...but nobody eats a shark.
1765119 1768535 See, this is Pez. Candy.
1768873 1770498 You see, you eat it.
1770583 1773454 You put the candy in here...
1773920 1777704 ...and when you lift the head,<br />the candy comes out and you can eat it.
1777799 1779258 You want some?
1782095 1783922 This is a peanut.
1784056 1785431 You eat it.
1785516 1789216 But you can't eat this one because this is fake.
1789561 1791768 This is money. You see?
1792440 1794978 We put the money in the peanut.
1795109 1797018 You see? Bank.
1797361 1798524 And then...
1800657 1802067 ...this is a car.
1802158 1805195 This is what we get around in.
1805412 1807321 See? A car.
1812169 1813628 Wait a second.
1813921 1816626 No. You don't eat them.
1817216 1818627 Are you hungry?

1865475 1866389 This.
1893922 1895464 Are you okay?
1898927 1900671 Too much excitement?
1901722 1902967 Want a Coke?
1906518 1908143 35 pounds.
1909605 1911183 35 pounds!
1912483 1913977 But you're so fat.
1917989 1919697 I wonder how tall you are.
1921534 1925615 I'm 4'6", you must be around...
1926289 1927784 ...3'...
1940805 1943972 This is where the water comes from. See?
1944225 1947143 This is hot and this is cold.
1947228 1950348 Now, it all comes from a big water tower.
1950774 1952813 It goes through pipes and sometimes...
1952901 1956602 ...dead bugs come through the pipes<br />and land in the bath.
1956947 1959616 It's real sick. Anyway, look.
1963579 1965737 Are you thirsty?
1973339 1975166 I'll get it.
1976926 1979678 Hi. Yeah, I'm fine.
1980263 1982801 Sure. Yeah, I still got a fever.
1983266 1986351 Yeah. No, get back.
1986728 1989813 I'm fine, Mom. Yeah.
1991150 1992395 Yeah.
1993318 1996403 No. Mom, I have to get in bed now.
1996488 1998197 Okay. Goodbye.
1999700 2001776 Mom, I'm sick.
2002203 2005619 Mom, I don't need to go to the doctor!
2006499 2010367 Mom, I only had a fever of 99 today.
2011421 2013248 Okay, and a half.
2015091 2017049 Okay, Mom. Okay, 'bye.
2018345 2021679 I've got to throw up. Mom, please.
2022349 2026347 I'm gonna throw up on the phone<br />if you don't let me go.
2027271 2030557 'Bye. Mom, I've got to throw up now.
2030816 2031848 Yeah...
2044039 2046411 You could drown in stuff like this.
2057261 2059420 Is this your idea of a good time?
2067230 2071098 "There are so many people to see
2071568 2075482 "So many people you can check upon<br />and add to your collection
2075572 2078407 "But they keep you hanging on
2078492 2080319 "Nothing but health shit
2081912 2086206 "Add to your collection<br />but they keep you hanging on"
2092090 2093335 Mike, come in.
2093424 2095998 How you feeling, faker?<br />I'm feeling fine.
2096094 2097636 I got something really important...
2097720 2100887 Tyler said he got 69,000 on Asteroids yesterday...
2100974 2103809 ...but he pulled the plug.<br />- Look, remember the goblin?
2103894 2105388 You're so lame, Elliott.
2105479 2107602 Come on, Michael. He came back.
2108190 2109732 He came back?
2110150 2112060 He came back?
2112152 2113730 My God!
2113821 2114983 One thing.
2116365 2118239 I have absolute power.
2118534 2119613 Say it.
2120411 2122902 - Say it!<br />- What have you got? Is it the coyote?
2122997 2125204 No. Look...
2126793 2129794 Okay. Now, swear it.
2129879 2132750 The most excellent promise you can make.
2132841 2135961 Swear as my only brother on our lives.
2136053 2138460 Don't get so heavy. I swear.
2138555 2141093 Okay. Stand over there.
2142184 2144426 You'd better take off<br />your shoulder pads.
2144520 2145800 You might scare him.
2145896 2147521 And close your eyes.
2148649 2150025 Don't push it, Elliott.
2150109 2153146 I'm not coming out there<br />until your eyes are closed.
2153279 2155355 Okay. They're closed.
2155907 2158315 Mom is going to kill you.
2160370 2163786 Okay. Swear it one more time.
2163915 2167332 - I have absolute power.<br />- You have absolute power.
2178139 2181674 Elliott! Look what I made for you!
2190694 2192105 Stop!
2197951 2199529 Kids, I'm home!
2199828 2200824 Guys?
2200913 2202288 In the closet, fast.
2202373 2204615 Anybody up there, kids?
2207086 2208284 Anybody home?
2208379 2210621 Hi, honey, how are you feel...
2211382 2213422 What happened in here?
2215136 2216678 You mean my room.
2218306 2219717 This is no room.
2220725 2222303 This is an accident.
2222561 2224553 I was reorganizing.
2224897 2226307 I can see that.
2226774 2229062 Put those shelves back on the wall.
2229151 2231144 Get the toys off the floor.
2231237 2233479 Make your bed since you are not using it.
2234782 2236656 You're feeling better, I see.
2236742 2240028 Will you guys watch Gertie for me<br />while I take a shower?
2240413 2241576 Absolutely.
2243374 2244573 'Bye, Mom.
2255596 2256710 Elliott...
2257347 2259340 I'm keeping him.
2261644 2263304 What is it?
2264188 2266810 He won't hurt you, Gertie.
2267400 2269689 He won't hurt you, Gertie.
2270069 2272027 We're not going to hurt you.
2273072 2275279 Is he a boy or a girl?
2275658 2276939 He's a boy.
2280414 2283035 Was he wearing any clothes?
2283375 2284406 No.
2285252 2288253 But, look, you can't tell.
2288339 2289963 Not even Mom.
2290049 2291294 Why not?
2291509 2294510 Because grownups can't see him.
2295471 2298342 Only little kids can see him.
2298599 2300224 Give me a break.
2301477 2305178 Well, do you know what's going<br />to happen if you do tell?
2308527 2310270 Do it, Mike. We have to.
2310362 2311773 No, please!
2312531 2314737 I'll do anything, please!
2314825 2317233 Help me! No, please!
2317369 2318401 Give it!
2319038 2320829 - Promise?<br />- Yes.
2321373 2322916 Do you promise?
2392991 2394699 What are you doing, Gert?
2395076 2397781 I'm going to play in Elliott's room.
2398914 2401037 Okay. Don't let him torture you.
2401124 2402916 I won't, Mary.
2409675 2410671 Hello?
2412094 2413553 Jerry!
2418810 2420933 Come on, come on. Hurry up.
2421855 2424560 Don't be pushy, pushy.
2428278 2429820 A plant for you.
2430530 2433235 Maybe he's some animal<br />that wasn't supposed to live.
2433325 2435033 Like those rabbits we saw that time.
2435119 2437195 Don't be lame.<br />Green, orange...
2437288 2439280 Could be a monkey or an orangutan.
2439373 2440784 A bald monkey?
2440875 2443876 Is he a pig? He sure eats like one.
2444420 2446164 You could make faces.
2446839 2449757 And make them mean and happy...
2449843 2451752 ...and make them get sharp teeth.
2451845 2453636 We are here.
2454472 2456761 We're here.<br />Use this.
2456850 2458890 You could make all sorts of things.
2459102 2461391 Okay. We're here.
2462106 2463137 We are here.
2463232 2464975 Where are you from?
2477914 2479823 I don't like his feet.
2479916 2482241 They're only feet, you little twerp.
2482335 2485087 He's trying to tell us something.
2494348 2495511 Earth.

2539437 2541015 What's he doing?
2542190 2543934 What's happening?
2557039 2558320 Elliott.
2561335 2562534 Oh, no.
2575726 2577101 Elliott, what is it?
2577185 2579225 I don't know. Something scary.
2599793 2600706 Got a pulse?
2600794 2601956 No, boss.
2605048 2608049 Hold it. We got it right here.
2610346 2611425 Follow him.
2611513 2612427 Okay.
2614308 2615968 You think it's this house?
2646467 2648045 Did you explain school to him?
2648135 2650508 How do you explain it<br />to higher intelligence?
2650596 2653170 Maybe he's not so smart.<br />Maybe he's a worker bee...
2653266 2655424 Who pushes buttons.<br />He's smart.
2655518 2657558 I hope we don't wake up on Mars...
2657812 2660648 ...surrounded by millions of little squashy guys.
2667656 2668819 Hi, Elliott.
2668907 2671233 - Elliott, where's your goblin?<br />- Shut up.
2671327 2672737 Did he come back?
2673078 2674324 Did he?
2674789 2676698 Yeah, he came back.
2676916 2679372 But he's not a goblin. He's a spaceman.
2680712 2682621 As in extraterrestrial.
2682714 2685881 Where's he from? Uranus? Get it? Your anus?
2686009 2689129 - He doesn't get it.<br />- Get it? Your anus?
2689221 2691260 - He doesn't get it.<br />- You're so immature.
2691348 2693008 And you're a sine supremus.
2693100 2694843 - Zero charisma.<br />- Sine supremus.
2694935 2696180 Zero charisma.
2696436 2697516 Shut up, Greg!
2697604 2699681 Sine supremus.<br />Zero charisma!
2699940 2701019 You wimp.
2711744 2713025 Let's go.
2716624 2719080 Come on. Get in the car. We'll be late.
2763007 2763956 Okay, boys and girls...
2764050 2767300 ...today we will be doing<br />the actual frog dissection...
2767386 2769545 ...for which we've been preparing.
2770473 2772549 And you will find...
2773059 2774803 ...many similarities.
2781193 2783482 As you get into the dissection...
2783570 2785943 ...you will discover that the anatomy...
2816647 2820146 The scalpel is very sharp.
2820985 2824069 Use discretion when you are cutting.
2824155 2825898 There will be very little blood.
2825990 2828944 There may be a few body fluids.
2880715 2884415 As we get started with the dissection...
2884927 2889554 ...remember that the things<br />you are writing down...
2900360 2904524 Some of the things that you should<br />look for during the dissection...
2904615 2908364 ...is to locate the heart<br />and notice that it is still beating.
2912248 2915119 I'm going to once more emphasize<br />the similarities...
2915209 2917582 ...of those things which we see...
2922467 2925041 Similarities with human anatomy.
2926138 2928889 First of all, here's the heart.
2934855 2939897 The intestines will be going<br />through their peristaltic action.
2941195 2944399 X- W-V-U...
2944615 2947107 ...A- F-P.
2947285 2948565 That is incorrect.
2948661 2950868 The correct spelling of nuisance...
2951039 2956959 ...is N-U-I-S-A-N-C-E.
2963802 2965427 They're pulling us up.
2971102 2974934 Class, these are the cotton balls<br />with the chloroform.
2975481 2979693 As soon as I get them all in,<br />put the lid on right away.
2980570 2981733 That's it.
2982697 2985367 That will start them going to sleep.
2988912 2992198 They won't feel anything. They won't be hurt.
2994585 2996376 It'll take a little while.
2996879 2999880 If you don't want to watch them,<br />you don't have to.
3019403 3020683 Say hi.
3021822 3023364 Can you talk?
3023824 3025402 Can you say hi?
3050644 3051759 Hello.
3051895 3053271 Uncle Ralph!
3053439 3056144 It's Uncle Ralph, long distance from California!
3056525 3058933 I'll talk fast. This call must be expensive.
3059278 3062232 No. If I call anytime on Saturday<br />without an operator...
3062323 3064779 ...it's five minutes for 85 cents plus tax.
3065034 3067490 If I talk less, I pay less.
3067579 3069370 Let me talk to that little fella.
3069456 3071781 Lou, it's Uncle Ralph.
3071875 3073832 Hello, Uncle Ralph.
3094274 3095768 Save him.
3102866 3106116 Run for your life! Back to the river!<br />Back to the forest!
3106203 3109738 Run! I want to save you!
3109957 3112033 Let's get out of here!
3114462 3115493 Get out!
3115963 3117956 I got to let him go!
3125056 3127013 You've got to save him!
3151960 3153751 Let me handle this!
3154712 3157286 Let me handle this! I can handle this.
3157382 3158757 Let me get this.
3212690 3214767 Sanford, what's wrong?
3215360 3218396 I'm afraid Betsy Sue<br />isn't going to run tomorrow.
3218613 3220855 No. Is it anything serious?
3220949 3224069 Harvey, I'm home. Come here, boy.
3235339 3236584 Here he is.
3236716 3237996 Here's who?
3238092 3241592 The man from the moon,<br />but I think you've killed him already.
3241679 3244680 As soon as I unload the stuff, okay?
3250939 3252315 Bugs.
3253942 3256101 I want you to meet somebody.
3256362 3258520 This stuff has gone up so much in one week.
3258614 3260488 I want you to meet somebody.
3260574 3263694 When I finish putting this stuff away, okay?
3275298 3277872 Stupid rag�. I knew it wouldn't come out.
3279886 3281511 "B."<br />"B."
3281597 3283423 What's with this?
3286602 3287847 Hello.
3289188 3290599 Yeah, this is she.
3291524 3292638 "Basket.
3292858 3293938 "Bandit.
3294026 3295224 "Ball.
3295319 3297727 "Basket. Bandit. Ball.
3298656 3299688 "Bugs.
3300158 3301320 "Bananas. "
3302702 3304362 Intoxicated?
3309334 3311660 You sure you have the right Elliott?
3311795 3312709 "B."
3312880 3313828 "B."
3314548 3316956 - "Biscuits. "<br />- "B."
3317801 3319130 But "B" is for boy...
3319220 3320251 "B."
3320346 3322255 ...with a baseball and bat.
3324100 3325724 You said "B."
3325852 3327262 "B."
3327645 3328974 You said "B."
3329063 3330226 Good.
3331107 3332649 "B."
3333777 3335235 "Good. "
3335570 3337693 I'll be right down. Thank you.
3340576 3342782 Gertie, I have to go pick up Elliott.
3342870 3345705 - Will you be a good girl...<br />- Mommy, he can talk.
3346081 3349367 Of course he can. I'll be back. Stay there.
3349960 3352084 Ladies and gentlemen...
3352171 3354579 ...little Grover here will demonstrate...
3354674 3358209 ...by chinning himself two times.
3358303 3359927 Two times?<br />Two times.
3360013 3361673 Can I start?<br />Go ahead.
3361931 3363260 Okay. Here we go.
3363516 3364631 Phone.

3366812 3367725 Phone.
3369856 3371565 Phone.
3374903 3377359 You want to call somebody?
3378449 3380905 I am not paying for frogs.
3381035 3383491 Be good. Be good.
3384872 3386580 Stay here. Stay.
3387208 3388584 Don't tell anybody.
3388668 3390577 Nobody.

3395759 3396624 Move.
3403142 3404091 God!
3404184 3406058 - Elliott.<br />- What?
3406395 3407593 Elliott.
3408063 3409178 Elliott.
3409357 3413189 I taught him how to talk. He can talk now.
3414153 3417107 Look what he brought up here all by himself.
3417657 3419780 What's he need this stuff for?
3419868 3420982 Elliott.
3422037 3423412 E.T. Can you say that?
3423496 3425205 Can you say E.T?
3425665 3427076 E.T.
3427417 3428746 E.T.
3429962 3431789 E.T.
3431922 3433085 Be good.
3433173 3435380 I taught him that, too.
3435718 3437461 You should give him his dignity.
3437553 3440803 This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen!
3441474 3442754 Phone.
3444143 3445554 Phone?
3445770 3447181 He said "phone"?
3447856 3448935 He said "phone"?
3449023 3450897 Can't you understand English?
3450984 3452526 He said "phone. "
3456490 3457818 Home.
3458116 3460904 You're right. That's E.T.'s home.
3469086 3471375 E. T...

3519848 3521508 Home.
3522893 3525301 Come on. I promise, Mom.<br />What book?
3525396 3526559 Any one you want.
3526647 3527845 Spiderman...
3528232 3530059 We'll just smile...
3530151 3533602 ...and try to get through the evening.<br />That's all I want to do.
3533905 3538033 We can't ask Cathy to trick-or-treat<br />in the same sheet she wore last year.
3538368 3541488 Now I wish I would've listened in science.
3542080 3543361 Think, Michael.
3543498 3546914 We should just grab anything<br />he could make a machine out of.
3547586 3549460 What would make a radar?
3549880 3552585 How the hell do I know?<br />You're the genius here.
3552758 3555130 You have absolute power, remember?
3555428 3558263 "I found him. He belongs to me. "
3571069 3572777 You know, Elliott...
3573864 3578027 ...he doesn't look too good anymore.<br />- Don't say that! We're fine!
3578660 3580452 What's all this "we" stuff?
3580704 3583030 You say "we" all the time.
3583165 3585739 Really, I think he's getting sick.<br />He's fine.
3585835 3588789 Okay, okay. Forget I mentioned it.
3589547 3591125 Grab that Fuzzbuster.
3600225 3601803 Dad's shirt.
3605939 3609190 Remember when he used to take us<br />out to the ball games...
3609276 3612728 ...and take us to the movies,<br />and we had popcorn fights?
3613572 3616609 We'll do that again, Elliott.<br />Sure.
3625293 3626787 Old Spice.
3626961 3628337 Sea Breeze.
3634136 3637552 "Peter says, 'The Redskins were defeated?
3637765 3640338 "'Wendy and the boys captured by the pirates?
3640434 3643056 "'I'll rescue her. I'll rescue her. '
3643521 3645348 "He leaps, first at his dagger...
3645439 3647598 "... then at his grindstone to sharpen it.
3647692 3650812 "But Tink rings out a warning cry.
3651863 3654532 "'Oh, that is just my medicine. '
3654616 3656739 "She says, 'Poisoned?
3657410 3658988 "'Who could've poisoned it? '
3659079 3663540 "'I promised Wendy to take it and I will,<br />as soon as I have sharpened my dagger. '
3663750 3665708 "Tinkerbell sees its red color...
3665878 3668665 "... and remembers the red in the pirate's eye...
3668756 3670464 "... nobly swallows the draft...
3670549 3672957 "... as Peter's hand is reaching for it.
3673427 3677128 "'Why, Tink, you have drunk my medicine. '
3677390 3680011 "She flutters strangely about the room...
3680101 3682639 "... answering him with a very faint tinkle. "
3682729 3685564 Ouch!
3689820 3691729 Ouch.
3703376 3706081 "She says she thinks<br />she could get well again...
3706170 3708246 "... if children believed in fairies.
3708339 3710628 "Do you believe? Say quick that you believe. "
3710717 3711831 I do!
3711926 3714299 "If you believe, clap your hands.
3714804 3717426 "Many clap, some don't, a few hiss.
3725566 3728567 "But Tink is saved. 'Thank you.
3729486 3732571 "'Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
3733115 3735523 "'And now to rescue Wendy. "'
3735827 3738282 Can you read it to me again?
3740790 3742035 "Peter says... "
3762980 3764890 He's putting it together now.
3765316 3768151 I told you he was smart.<br />I'm worried, Elliott.
3768236 3771522 He could blow up the house.<br />He knows what he's doing.
3771614 3773987 Listen to how he's breathing.
3774576 3776782 It's going to work.
3776870 3778946 What's he feeling now?
3779289 3781282 He's feeling everything.
3804774 3807479 You're going as a ghost. You promised.
3807611 3811146 I'm only pretending I'm going as a cowgirl.
3812115 3815200 Okay. Now, you know the plans by heart,<br />don't you?
3815327 3817071 Meet you at the lookout.
3817162 3819701 At the lookout. I'm not stupid, you know.
3819790 3823456 You won't get four blocks<br />in this neighborhood dressed like that.
3823544 3826380 I mean it. You are not going as a hippy!
3826464 3827662 All the guys are!
3827757 3829666 I'm not stupid, you know.
