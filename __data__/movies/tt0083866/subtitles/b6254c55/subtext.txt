2121452 2125289 - 'Cause, uh, grownups can't see him.
2125323 2128593 Only little kids can see him.
2128626 2130261 - Give me a break.
2130294 2133831 - Well, do you know what's going to happen
2133865 2135566 if you do tell?
2138436 2139971 Do it, Mike. We have to.
2140004 2142773 - Oh, no! Please, no!
2142807 2144709 Don't do anything, please!
2144742 2147712 Gertie, help me. Help me.
2147745 2149881 - Promise?
2149914 2151249 - Yes.
2151282 2153317 - Do you promise?
2157588 2160358 - ( groans )
2200331 2203367 ( keys jangle )
2222486 2224989 - What are you doing, Gert?
2225022 2228926 - I'm going to play in Elliott's room.
2228960 2231028 - Okay. Don't let him torture you.
2231062 2233264 - I won't, Mary.
2248546 2251782 - Come on. Come on, hurry up.
2251816 2254752 - Don't be pushy, pushy.
2258389 2259690 That's for you.
2259724 2263361 - Maybe he's some animal that wasn't supposed to live.
2263394 2264528 You know, like those rabbits we saw that time.
2264562 2265696 - Red, green, orange, red--
2265730 2266764 - Don't be lame.
2266797 2268933 - Could be a monkey or an orangutan or something.
2268966 2270534 - A bald monkey?
2270568 2273871 - Is he a pig? He sure eats like one.
2273904 2276540 You can make faces
2276574 2280478 and make them mean and happy
2280511 2282013 and make them get sharp teeth--
2282046 2283814 - We are here.
2283848 2285082 - And you can make 'em have their head cut off.
2285116 2286384 - We're here. - No, use this.
2289086 2291555 - Okay, we're here.
2291589 2294792 We are here. Where are you from?
2294825 2297395 - ( gurgles )
2308406 2309540 - I don't like his feet.
2309573 2311742 - They're only feet, you little twerp.
2311776 2313844 He's trying to tell us something.
2324155 2326991 Earth.
2327024 2328693 Home.
2328726 2330695 Home.
2330728 2332596 Home.
2332630 2333631 - ( grunts )
2369767 2371102 - What's he doing?
2371135 2374972 - What's happening?
2375005 2378409 ( rumbling )
2386083 2388519 - Elliott.
2389987 2392456 - Oh, wow.
2394692 2396427 Aah!
2404969 2407071 - Elliott, what is it?
2407104 2409573 - I don't know. Something scary.
2425055 2429026 ( keys jangle )
2429059 2431996 ( voices )
2462159 2465529 - ( coos )
2475773 2477975 - Did you explain school to him?
2478008 2480211 - How do you explain school to higher intelligence?
2480244 2481278 - Maybe he's not that smart.
2481312 2482346 Maybe he's like a worker bee
2482379 2484081 who only knows how to push buttons or something.
2484114 2485649 - He's smart.
2485683 2487651 - Okay. I just hope we don't wake up on Mars or something
2487685 2491555 surrounded by millions of little squashy guys.
2497328 2498562 - Hey, Elliott.
2498596 2500631 - Hey, Elliott. Where's your goblin?
2500664 2502900 - Shut up. - Did he come back?
2502933 2504768 Well, did he?
2504802 2508272 - Yeah, he came back, but he's not a goblin.
2508305 2509707 He's a spaceman.
2509740 2510341 - Ooh!
2510374 2512710 - As in extraterrestrial.
2512743 2514612 - Where's he from, Uranus?
2514645 2516313 Get it? Your anus?
2516347 2518983 - He doesn't get it, Ty. - Get it? Your anus?
2519016 2521185 - He doesn't get it. - You're so immature.
2521218 2522853 - You're such a cintus supremus.
2522887 2524922 - Zero charisma. - Cintus supremus.
2524955 2526290 - Zero charisma. - Cintus supremus.
2526323 2527658 - Shut up, Greg.
2527691 2529360 - Cintus supremus. - Zero charisma.
2529393 2531629 - You wimp!
2531662 2534732 ( shouting and laughing )
2541639 2543040 - Let's go.
2546410 2548812 Come on. Get in the car. We're gonna be late.
2552283 2554618 ( scraping )
2591288 2592256 - ( sighs )
2592289 2593324 - Okay, boys and girls.
2593357 2597194 Today we will be doing the actual frog dissection
2597227 2600264 for which we've been preparing,
2600297 2605135 and you will find many similarities...
2610908 2613677 As you get into the dissection,
2613711 2616180 you will discover that the anatomy...
2637201 2640204 ( growls )
2646477 2650414 - The scalpel is very sharp.
2650447 2654318 Use discretion when you are cutting.
2654351 2655886 There will be very little blood.
2655919 2659189 There may be a few body fluids.
2670434 2672036 - ( sniffs )
2685149 2687951 ( sneezes )
2691989 2693791 - Blech!
2705202 2706103 ( barks )
2710174 2712242 - As we get started with the dissection...
2712276 2713243 - ( belch )
2713277 2715045 - Eew.
2715079 2720117 - Remember that the things that you are writing down...
2728158 2730027 - ( belch )
2730060 2732863 - One thing that you should be looking for
2732896 2736133 during the dissection is to locate the heart
2736166 2739136 and notice that it is still beating.
2739169 2742406 - ( groans )
2742439 2743540 - I need to once more emphasize
2743574 2748112 the similarities of those things which we see in the...
2752483 2756053 Similarities to the human anatomy.
2756086 2760824 First of all, here's the heart, which is beating.
2764461 2767564 The intestines will be going through
2767598 2770934 their peristaltic action.
2770968 2777274 - Computer voice: S-W-V-U-A-F-P.
2777307 2778842 That is incorrect.
2778876 2787117 The correct spelling of nuisance is N-U-I-S-A-N-C-E.
2793590 2795092 - They're pulling us up.
2801064 2803467 - Now, class, these are the cotton balls
2803500 2804935 with the chloroform,
2804968 2807137 and as soon as I get them all in,
2807171 2809640 be sure and put the lid on right away.
2809673 2811975 That's it.
2812009 2814978 That will start them going to sleep.
2819049 2824121 They won't feel anything. They won't be hurt.
2824154 2826323 It'll take a little while.
2826356 2829860 If you don't want to watch them, you don't have to.
2848612 2851548 - Say hi.
2851582 2853517 Can you talk?
2853550 2856653 Can you say hi?
2856687 2858989 - ( groans )
2866163 2867264 ( belches )
2880310 2883280 - Hello? Uncle Ralph.
2883313 2886016 It's Uncle Ralph long distance from California.
2886049 2888685 Ooh, I'll talk fast. This call is expensive.
2888719 2890220 - Oh, no, no, no.
2890254 2892189 If I call anytime on Saturday without an operator,
2892222 2895192 I can go for five minutes for 85 cents plus tax.
2895225 2896960 If I talk less, I pay less.
2896994 2899696 Let me talk to that little fella, huh?
2899730 2901531 - Say hello to your Uncle Ralph.
2901565 2904101 - Hello, Uncle Ralph.
2922286 2923453 - ( grunts )
2923487 2926189 - Save him.

2934197 2937200 Down to the river. Down to the forest. Run!
2938368 2939703 I wanna save you.
2939736 2942105 Let's get out of here.
2944107 2948111 Get out. I gotta let him go.
2955385 2957421 You gotta save him.
2980744 2983146 - Let me handle this.
2983180 2986683 I can handle this. I can handle this.
2986717 2989086 I can get this.
2994391 2996593 - Aah!
3032896 3035499 ( TV plays )
3042506 3045208 - Francis, what's wrong?
3045242 3048178 - I'm afraid Betsy Sue isn't going to run tomorrow.
3048211 3050847 - Oh, no. Is it anything serious?
3050881 3053617 - Harvey, I'm home. Come here, boy.
3055819 3059089 - ( muttering )
3065328 3068265 - Here he is. - Here's who?
3068298 3069499 - The man from the moon.
3069533 3071468 But I think you killed him already.
3071501 3075138 - Honey, just as soon as I unload this stuff, okay?
3080444 3082112 - Med-bugs.
3083380 3085916 - I want you to meet somebody.
3085949 3088618 - This stuff has gone up so much in one week.
3088652 3090420 - I want you to meet somebody.
3090454 3091888 - Okay, honey. As soon as I get finished
3091922 3094124 putting all this stuff away, all right?
3104534 3107571 Stupid Ragu. I knew it wouldn't come out.
3109940 3111541 - B. - B is for basket.
3111575 3114478 ( telephone rings ) - What's up with this mess?
3114511 3116546 ( ring )
3116580 3118849 - Hello?
3118882 3121685 Yeah, this is she.
3121718 3124921 - Basket, bandit, ball.
3124955 3127858 Basket, bandit, ball.
3127891 3129593 - He was feeling a little ill yesterday.
3129626 3131828 - Bananas.
3131862 3134264 - Intoxicated?
3136533 3138935 ( sniffs )
3138969 3141738 You sure you have the right Elliott?
3141771 3145408 - B. B. Biscuits.
3145442 3147210 - B.

3235532 3236333 - What?
3236366 3239302 - Elliott. Elliott.
3239336 3241304 - I taught him how to talk.
3241338 3243306 Now he can talk now.
3243340 3244341 - Elliott.
3244374 3246443 - Look what he brought up here all by himself.
3246476 3248011 - Elliott, Elliott.
3248044 3249913 - What's he need this stuff for?
3249946 3250914 - Elliott.
3250947 3253717 - E.T. Can you say that?

3263426 3265495 - Be good. I taught him that, too.
3265528 3267430 - You should give him his dignity.
3267464 3269933 This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.
3269966 3273336 - Phone.
3273370 3277674 - Phone? He said phone?
3277707 3278975 He said phone?

3356653 3357520 - Football.
3357554 3359489 - Fine. We'll just put a smile on our faces
3359522 3360490 and try to get through the evening.
3360523 3361658 That's all I want to do.
3361691 3362759 - Okay. Make some of your garlic bread.
3362792 3363760 That's all I'm asking.
3363793 3365829 - I can't ask Kathy to go trick or treating
3365862 3367697 in the same old sheet she wore last year.
3367731 3372168 - Now I wish I would have listened in science.
3372202 3373536 Think, Michael.
3373570 3374771 - I guess we could just grab anything
3374804 3376973 that looks like he can make a machine out of.
3377006 3379542 - What would make a radar?
3379576 3382545 - How the hell do I know? You're the genius here.
3382579 3384981 You have absolute power, remember?
3385014 3387951 "I found him. He belongs to me."
3400597 3403199 You know, Elliott,
3403233 3405702 he doesn't look too good anymore.
3405735 3407971 - Don't say that. We're fine.
3408004 3410507 - What's all this "we" stuff?
3410540 3412776 You say "we" all the time now.
3412809 3414944 Really, Elliott, I think he might be getting kind of sick.
3414978 3416079 - Look, he's fine, Michael.
3416112 3419048 - Okay, okay. Forget I mentioned it.
3419082 3421551 Grab that fuzz buster.
3429959 3431728 - Dad's shirt.
3431761 3433062 - Yeah.
3435131 3438701 - Remember when he used to take us out to the ball games
3438735 3440970 and take us to the movies?
3441004 3443206 We'd have popcorn fights.
3443239 3445041 - We'll do that again, Elliott.
3445074 3447477 - Sure.
3448845 3449879 ( sniffs )
3453883 3454951 - ( sniffs )
3454984 3456753 Old Spice.
3456786 3458788 - Sea Breeze.
3463626 3467597 - "Peter says, The redskins were defeated?
3467630 3470533 "Wendy and the boys captured by the pirates?
3470567 3473069 "I'll rescue her. I'll rescue her.
3473102 3475238 "He leaps first at his dagger,
3475271 3477740 "and then at his grindstone to sharpen it.
3477774 3479275 "But Tink alights near the shed
3479309 3481244 "and rings out a warning cry.
3481277 3483880 "Oh, that is just my medicine.
3483913 3488751 "She says, poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?
3488785 3490620 "I promised Wendy I'd take it,
3490653 3493189 "and I will as soon as I have sharpened my dagger.
3493223 3495925 "Tink, who sees its red color
3495959 3498328 "and remembers the red in the pirate's eye,
3498361 3500163 "nobly swallows the draft
3500196 3503733 "as Peter's hand is reaching for it.
3503766 3507203 "Why, Tink, you have drunk my medicine.
3507237 3509873 "She flutters strangely about the room,
3509906 3512275 answering him now in a very faint tinkle."
3512308 3513776 - Ouch. Ouch.
3513810 3516980 - "It was poison and you drank it to save my life?
3517013 3519883 Tink, dear Tink!"
3519916 3521784 - Ouch.
3530693 3532896 - "She says...
3532929 3535798 "She say she thinks she could get well again
3535832 3538201 if children believed in fairies."
3538234 3540670 Do you believe in fairies? Say quick that you believe.
3540703 3542305 - I do, I do, I do.
3542338 3544741 - If you believe, clap your hands.
3544774 3546876 "Some clap, some don't. A few hiss.
3546910 3550580 And then perhaps a rush of Nanas to the nurseries..."
3555151 3559222 "But Tink is saved. Thank you.
3559255 3562392 "Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
3562425 3565228 And now to rescue Wendy."
3565261 3568298 - Can you read it to me again?
3568331 3571100 - ( snoring )
3571134 3572635 - "Peter says...
3592689 3594791 - He's putting it together now.
3594824 3596726 I told you he was smart.
3596759 3597927 - I'm worried, Elliott.
3597961 3599729 He could blow up the whole house.
3599762 3601331 - He knows what he's doing.
3601364 3602865 - Listen to how he's breathing.
3602899 3604334 - ( labored breathing )
3604367 3606235 - It's going to work.
3606269 3608404 - What's he feeling now?
3608438 3610907 - He's feeling everything.
3634764 3637433 - Now, you're going as a ghost. You promised.
3637467 3641170 - I'm only pretending I'm going as a cowgirl.
3641204 3644874 - Okay. Now you know the plans by heart, don't you?
3644907 3646776 - Meet you at the lookout.
3646809 3649445 At the lookout. I'm not stupid, you know.
3649479 3651914 - Listen, buster, you won't get four blocks
3651948 3653750 in this neighborhood dressed like that.
3653783 3655051 - Please? - No, and that is final.
3655084 3656719 You are not going as a terrorist.
3656753 3657720 - But all the guys are.
3657754 3659956 - I'm not stupid, you know.
3668064 3669165 - Ready?
3669198 3670800 - Ready.
3687950 3689252 - No, wait, Mom. Don't look.
3689285 3690787 - Okay.
3696392 3699762 - Okay, Mom, you can look now.
3699796 3702498 - ( screams and laughs )
3702532 3704100 Oh, that's great.
3704133 3706903 - ( grunts )
3706936 3708337 - Yes.
3708371 3711808 ( laughs )
3714243 3717046 - ( grunts ) Ooh.
3719315 3721184 Ouch...
3721217 3722852 - Stop that. No, don't.
3722885 3724821 - Ouch, ouch, ouch.
3724854 3727323 - It's a fake knife. It's fake.
3727356 3728958 - Ouch.
3728991 3730193 - Okay.
3736966 3740303 Oh, you look great.
3740336 3742138 - Thank you. - Thank you.

3826589 3831060 Home. Home. Home.
3833429 3836065 - Be back one hour after sunset, no later.
3836098 3839035 - I'll try as fast as I can, Mike.
3839068 3840436 You gotta cover me.
3843139 3844941 - ( grunts )
3844974 3847243 - Well? Come on, help me.
3847276 3849011 - We'll be waiting for you, Elliott.
3849045 3850880 Just come back for sure.
3877373 3879442 - It's too bumpy. We'll have to walk from here!
3879475 3883179 E.T.!
3893456 3896425 Not so high! Not so high!
3925321 3927490 ( laughs )
3934597 3936632 Don't crash, please?
3936666 3938301 - ( grunts )
3938334 3940036 - Whoa!
3997727 4002331 ( howling )
4020349 4024220 - I really can't believe you did this.
4026856 4029458 ( muttering )
4029492 4032094 Your father's gonna hear about this one.
4039435 4041337 ( sighs ) Mexico.
4055751 4058354 ( keys jangle )
4093756 4096358 - ( sighs )
4125554 4127623 - E.T., it's working.
4127656 4129525 - ( grunts )
4129558 4130926 - It's working!
4130960 4132828 - Home.
4132862 4135831 - You did it.
4135865 4137800 It's working.
4137833 4140703 - Home?
4140736 4144673 - E.T., it's working!
4168464 4171367 ( beeping )
4187883 4190653 - We have to go now, E.T.
4190686 4193656 We're so late already.
4193689 4196392 ( coughs )
4199929 4202498 We have to go home now, E.T.
4202531 4203766 - ( grunts )
4208571 4211340 - You should give 'em some time.
4213776 4215778 - Ouch.
4222518 4224486 - You could be happy here.
4224520 4226989 I could take care of you.
4227022 4228991 I wouldn't let anybody hurt you.
4229024 4231660 We could grow up together, E.T.
4237333 4240769 - Home.
4240803 4243539 Home.
4275704 4278574 ( moans )
4282678 4284847 Home.
4319148 4320749 - E.T.?
4323719 4325754 E.T.?
4332127 4334630 - How was he dressed when last seen?
4334663 4340169 - He was dressed as a hunchback.
4340202 4342871 - Hunchback.
4342905 4344173 Is there anything to indicate
4344206 4345641 that he might have run away?
4345674 4348644 Any family problems or recent arguments?
4350779 4353882 - Um, my husband and I just separated recently,
4353916 4359021 and it hasn't been easy on the children, but--
4359054 4361657 - My father's in Mexico.
4367529 4369531 - But run away?
4369565 4372034 Where would he have gone? ( crying )
4372067 4374002 - Elliott!
4374036 4375604 - Oh, Elliott!
4375637 4379575 Don't ever do this again, Elliott!
4381243 4383912 Oh, my, you're so hot.
4383946 4387049 Run up and draw him a bath quick, Gert.
4387082 4389885 I'm sorry I yelled at you.
4392588 4395457 Thanks very much for all your trouble.
4395491 4397893 - Is he here?
4399995 4402097 You've got to find him, Mike.
4402131 4404099 - Where is he?
4404133 4408504 - In the forest in the bald spot.
4408537 4410873 You've got to find him.
4461156 4462958 - E.T.!
4466295 4468497 E.T.!
4470899 4472000 E.T.!
4484913 4487115 ( thunder )
4510806 4512274 No!
4512307 4515110 - ( groans )
4521950 4524820 ( keys jangle )
4543805 4546341 - Mom? Would you come with me?
4546375 4548243 - What is it?
4548277 4550245 - Mary, just come with me.
4550279 4551880 - Michael, what?
4551914 4554082 - Mom, remember the goblin?
4554116 4555784 - Michael, what are you talking about?
4555817 4558120 - Just swear the most excellent promise you can make.
4558153 4559755 - Michael.
4566261 4567829 That's terrific.
4574069 4576872 - Mom.
4581009 4583612 - We're sick.
4585681 4588016 I think we're dying.
4591153 4592321 - Michael...
4592354 4593989 - Mom, it's okay.
4594022 4595090 - ( groans )
4595123 4596892 - Go downstairs.
4596925 4600195 - He's not gonna hurt you, Mom.
4600228 4601296 - He's not gonna hurt you.
4601330 4603265 - Michael, get her downstairs.
4603298 4605133 - It's the man from the moon.
4605167 4608670 It's the man from the moon.
4608704 4610272 - ( groans )
4610305 4612140 - You don't know him.
4612174 4614009 You don't know him.
4614042 4617346 - ( cries )
4617379 4620716 - We can't leave him alone.
4643238 4644840 - Aah!
4654249 4656852 ( train whistle blows )
4659488 4661857 - This is my home!
4678240 4681109 - ( shallow breathing )
4687215 4690118 ( footsteps )
4710405 4713975 - Home.
4714009 4715277 Home.
4739167 4742037 ( police radio )
4747209 4749177 ( keys jangle )
4792354 4794289 - I don't know. - Does he sleep at night?
4794322 4795457 - I don't know.
4795490 4796925 What's the matter with Elliott?
4796958 4799995 - Have you noticed any surface swelling?
4800028 4800996 - No.
4801029 4802464 - Has it lost any hair?
4802497 4804199 - He never had any hair.
4804232 4805634 - Are the children all right?
4805667 4809070 - Did it ever build anything or write anything down?
4809104 4810539 - Uh, no.
4810572 4812140 - You say it has the ability
4812174 4815043 to manipulate its own environment?
4815076 4818013 - He's smart. He communicates through Elliott.
4818046 4820949 - Elliott thinks its thoughts?
4820982 4825420 - No. Elliott feels his feelings.
4829524 4831626 - We've identified the primary carrier.
4831660 4833094 It's definitely not recognizable.
4833128 4835363 - Testing shows no deficits on FNF
4835397 4836965 and HPS testing.
4836998 4839367 EEG analysis shows complete coherent and synchronization
4839401 4841503 of brainwave activity from both subjects.
4841536 4843638 - Isotonic.
4843672 4847008 Nitrates, 255 mili-equivalents.
4852214 4853949 - We have medi-starts available.
4853982 4855250 - Step five for helo.
4855283 4856351 - CVC line can help.
4856384 4858620 - I think we'd get more information with a Swan-Ganz.
4858653 4860255 - Fine, but let's do another thorax.
4860288 4863692 - Oxygen saturation is 82% on room air.
4863725 4865694 - You're scaring him.
4865727 4868396 You're scaring him!
4868430 4871633 - Good air entry, but decreased tidal volume on the boy.
4871666 4874102 Put him on .025 liters by nasal cannula
4874135 4877205 and draw a blood gas in 20 minutes.
4877239 4879374 - Get a hypothermia blanket and some--
4879407 4882410 - Leave him alone.
4882444 4885280 Leave him alone. I can take care of him.
4885313 4886982 - Get a Doppler scope in here.
4887015 4888350 and set me up for a two deep cardiac echo.
4888383 4889184 - I'm seeing diaphoretic.
4889217 4890552 We should consider all shock ideology.
4890585 4892420 - He's not profusing at all.
4892454 4893555 He needs anatropic support.
4893588 4895557 pH is down to 7.03.
4895590 4897726 He's got a metabolic acidosis.
4897759 4899694 It could be sepsis.
4899728 4902230 - We've drawn two sets of blood cultures.
4902264 4905433 - He needs broad specular coverage.
4912741 4914409 - Elliott?
4916711 4919014 I've been to the forest.
4919047 4921349 - He shouldn't talk now.
4921383 4925020 - Well, he has to talk now, Major.
4927122 4931459 Elliott, that machine, what does it do?
4931493 4935330 - The communicator?
4937098 4940001 Is it still working?
4940035 4945440 - It's doing something. What?
4945473 4947642 - I really shouldn't tell.
4947676 4950712 He came to me.
4950745 4953214 He came to me.
4953248 4957285 - Elliott, he came to me, too.
4957319 4962490 I've been wishing for this since I was 10 years old.
4962524 4964492 I don't want him to die.
4964526 4968396 What can we do that we're not already doing?
4968430 4972500 - He needs to go home.
4972534 4977639 He's calling his people.
4977672 4981409 I don't know where they are.
4981443 4983812 He needs to go home.
4983845 4985714 - Elliott, I don't think
4985747 4991186 that he was left here intentionally,
4991219 4995490 but his being here is a miracle, Elliott.
4995523 4998226 It's a miracle.
4998259 5001629 And you did the best that anybody could do.
5004532 5008303 I'm glad he met you first.
5016211 5017412 - He's got DNA.
5017445 5019147 - Incredible.
5019180 5020548 - He's got DNA.
5020582 5021816 - He doesn't have four nucleotides like we do.
5021850 5023151 He has six.
5023184 5024219 - I've got desynchronization
5024252 5025453 of the two brainwave activity.
5029124 5030191 - E.T.!
5030225 5031393 - The boy's condition is stabilizing.
5031426 5033361 His blood pressure's coming back up.
5033395 5037298 - E.T.?
5037332 5039801 - Elliott?
5039834 5041569 - He's speaking!
5041603 5042570 - He's talking!
5042604 5047575 - E.T., stay with me.
5047609 5049177 Please.
5049210 5052781 - Stay together.
5052814 5056785 - I'll be right here.
5056818 5059854 I'll be right here.
5059888 5067362 - Stay, Elliott.
5068897 5071733 Stay.
5071766 5074536 Stay.
5076738 5080542 Stay.
5080575 5083178 Stay.
5083211 5084279 - The creature's pressure is bottoming out.
5084312 5085847 His complexes are slow and widening.
5085880 5088316 - How's the boy?
5088349 5090652 - He's converting back to normal sinus rhythm.
5091753 5092754 - They're separating.
5092787 5094189 - Yes, definitely separating.
5094222 5095490 - Boy and creature are completely separated.
5095523 5098226 - What does that mean? - The boy's coming back.
5098259 5099594 We're losing E.T.
5099627 5102764 - E.T., answer me, please.
5102797 5105366 - Everything's going to be fine.
5105400 5107402 - Please. - Just relax.
5174736 5176304 - No!
5176337 5177438 - E.T., don't go!
5177472 5178573 ( alarm sounds ) - No blood pressure!
5178606 5180475 - He's got no pulse or respiration.
5182577 5184312 We can't get a pulse or blood pressure on the creature.
5184345 5185313 - It doesn't look like he's breathing.
5185346 5186414 - We gotta get in there.
5186447 5187982 - You can't break a sterile field.
5188016 5189784 - Get back.
5189817 5191553 - Leave him alone!
5191586 5193888 - How's he doing? - You're killing him!
5193922 5195323 Leave him alone.
5195356 5197258 - Get him moving.
5197292 5199360 - Okay, let's get the boy out of here. Get him moving.
5199394 5201629 - Stop it! You're killing him!
5201663 5203498 You're killing him!
5203531 5205633 - Move the gurney over here. Let's go.
5205667 5206935 - You're killing him!
5206968 5210505 You're killing him! You're killing him!
5210538 5211539 He came to me.
5211573 5213341 - Let's ventilate him. Any pulses?
5213374 5214876 - No femoral pulse. - Any pulses?
5214909 5216744 - He came to me!
5216778 5219747 ( overlapping voices )
5228856 5230425 - Let's try some bretylium.
5230458 5232660 May we have some bretylium, please?
5234062 5235463 - Getting a pulse?
5235496 5237599 - Compressed air. Compressed air is fine.
5241836 5242837 - He's not ventilating!
5243972 5247375 His pupils are fixed and dilated.
5247408 5248843 - Quiet! Quiet!
5253948 5255617 - Everybody stand clear.
