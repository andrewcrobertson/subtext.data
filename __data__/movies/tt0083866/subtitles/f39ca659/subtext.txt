8304 9632 Ready?
9722 11097 Ready.
28282 30570 Wait, Mom. Don't look.<br />Okay.
36790 38747 Okay, Mom. You can look now.
43213 45087 That's great.
47008 48502 Stay here.
59062 60472 Ouch.
61105 62932 Stop that! No! Don't!
63024 64399 Ouch.
65151 67357 It's a fake knife. It's a fake.
67445 69402 Ouch.<br />Okay.
75327 76608 All right.
78497 80288 You look great!
80457 81951 - Thank you.<br />- Thank you.
82042 83750 Thank you.
92386 95221 Be back one hour after sundown. No later.
100560 101805 'Bye.
104814 106688 Gertie, come here. Come on.
129713 131256 Trick or treat?
136845 138387 Trick or treat?
163288 165576 Home. Home.
165665 168500 Home.
173589 176127 Be back one hour after sunset. No later.
176509 179178 I'll try as fast as I can, Mike.
179261 181337 You got to cover me.
184809 186931 Well, come on. Help me.
187061 190512 We'll be waiting for you, Elliott.<br />So come back for sure.
217340 220127 It's too bumpy. We'll have to walk from here!
220301 222258 E.T!
233731 236056 Not so high! Not so high!
274854 276348 Don't crash, please.
361438 363846 I really can't believe you did this.
370072 373275 Your father's going to hear<br />about this one.
380081 381540 Mexico.
428336 429368 Boo!
429921 431546 Trick or treat?
443726 445137 Bull's-eye.
449440 450685 Good shot.
451984 453443 Where's Elliott?
455780 458021 I'm asking you a question.
459700 463912 Anyways, why would Elliott go to the forest?
464413 467200 Why would he do such a thing?
468542 470084 Get in the car.
470919 472414 Get in the car, now.
518215 520124 E.T., it's working.
521719 523296 It's working!
523554 524799 Home.
526056 527515 You did it!
528517 529928 It's working!
530435 531846 Home.
533397 536267 E.T., it's working!
580401 582274 We have to go now, E.T.
583237 584945 We're so late already.
592329 594784 We have to go home now, E.T.
601171 603210 You should give them some time.
605925 607633 Ouch.
615143 616969 You could be happy here.
617103 619012 I could take care of you.
619188 621513 I wouldn't let anybody hurt you.
621607 623730 We could grow up together, E.T.
629573 631281 Home.
633118 634862 Home.
667986 669528 Home.
674909 676533 Home.
711236 712516 E.T?
716074 717272 E.T?
724499 726824 How was he dressed when last seen?
727668 729542 He was dressed as a...
730713 732124 ...hunchback.
732673 734049 Hunchback.
735051 737968 Is there anything to indicate<br />that he might have run away?
738054 740591 Any family problems or recent arguments?
743976 746846 My husband and I just separated recently...
747313 750812 ...and it hasn't been easy on the children,<br />but...
751233 753558 My father's in Mexico.
760033 761942 But run away, I...
762494 764368 Where would he have gone?
764538 765783 Elliott.
765872 767664 Oh, Elliott!
769042 771747 Don't ever do this again, Elliott!
774130 776253 Oh, my. You're so hot.
776925 779462 Run up and draw him a bath. Quick, Gert.
780261 782218 Sorry I yelled at you.
785641 788013 Thanks very much for all your trouble.
788686 790429 Is he here?
792773 795395 You've got to find him.<br />Where is he?
796318 797943 In the forest.
798612 800404 At the bald spot.
801156 802864 You've got to find him.
853666 854864 E.T!
858587 859785 E.T!
862800 864175 E.T!
902797 904077 No!
904382 905757 No!
936162 938618 Mom, would you come with me?
939165 940541 What is it?
940625 942416 Mary, just come with me.
942836 944413 Michael, what?
944879 947915 - Mom, remember the goblin?<br />- What are you talking about?
948007 950498 Swear the most excellent promise<br />you can make.
950593 951921 Michael.
958559 960053 That's terrific.
966650 968144 Mom.
974032 975657 We're sick.
978078 980201 I think we're dying.
983875 985951 Michael.<br />Mom, it's okay.
987838 989166 Downstairs.
989506 991629 He's not going to hurt you, Mom.
992300 993581 He won't hurt you.
993677 995384 Michael, get her downstairs.
995470 997178 It's the man from the moon.
997263 999256 The man from the moon!
1003186 1005937 You don't know him! You don't know him!
1010902 1012894 We can't leave him alone.
1051816 1054058 This is my home!
1102782 1104241 Home.
1106202 1107317 Home.
1147576 1151490 The Collagen Unit,<br />report to the Blue Level immediately.
1185404 1187313 Does he sleep?<br />I don't know.
1187406 1189446 What's the matter with Elliott?
1190242 1192816 Have you noticed any sweating?<br />No.
1193370 1196075 Has it lost hair?<br />He never had any hair.
1196331 1198158 Are the children all right?
1198250 1200871 Did it build or write anything?
1200961 1202455 No.
1202587 1206122 You say it has the ability<br />to manipulate its own environment?
1207426 1210379 He's smart.<br />He communicates through Elliott.
1210887 1213212 Elliott thinks its thoughts.
1213306 1216841 No. Elliott feels his feelings.
1221189 1223976 We've identified<br />his primary carrier protein.
1224067 1225609 It's definitely not albumin.
1225693 1228694 The testing shows no deficits<br />on FNF and HTS testing.
1228780 1232824 EEG analysis shows complete coherence<br />and synchronization of brainwave activity...
1232909 1234237 ...between subjects.
1241459 1244958 There's no response at 20 per kilo.<br />Let's move to hypertonic saline.
1245546 1247289 Cut five per kilo.
1252261 1254419 You have no right to do this.
1256181 1257675 You're scaring him.
1258308 1259553 You're scaring him!
1259643 1261054 Respiratory rate: 12.
1261144 1263931 Good air entry<br />but decreased tidal volume on the boy.
1264022 1267723 Put him on 025 liters by nasal cannula<br />and draw blood gas in 20 minutes.
1267817 1270106 Temperature's dropped<br />from 20 to 17 degrees.
1270195 1272520 Get a hypothermia blanket<br />and some rags.
1272614 1274238 Leave him alone.
1274324 1277989 Leave him alone. I can take care of him.
1278286 1280409 ...and set me up for a 2D cardiac echo.
1280496 1282489 Skin is cool and diaphoretic.
1282582 1285583 He's not refusing at all.<br />He needs anatropic support.
1285668 1287246 PH is down to 7.03.
1287336 1291500 He's got a metabolic acidosis. It could be sepsis.
1292216 1294588 We've drawn two sets of blood cultures.
1294677 1297168 He needs broad spectrum coverage.
1304937 1306265 Elliott.
1309066 1310975 I've been to the forest.
1312027 1313818 He shouldn't talk now.
1314446 1316984 Well, he has to talk now, Major.
1319618 1321491 Elliott, that machine...
1321912 1324034 ...what does it do?
1325540 1327616 The communicator?
1329294 1331619 Is it still working?
1332172 1334164 It's doing something.
1335258 1336800 What?
1337635 1339544 I really shouldn't tell.
1340513 1342506 He came to me.
1343015 1345008 He came to me.
1346102 1348937 Elliott, he came to me, too.
1350398 1353683 I've been wishing for this<br />since I was 10 years old.
1354485 1356608 I don't want him to die.
1357321 1360073 What can we do that we're not already doing?
1361033 1363738 He needs to go home.
1365454 1367696 He's calling his people...
1369791 1372163 ...and I don't know where they are.
1373211 1375334 He needs to go home.
1376381 1380165 Elliott, I don't think<br />that he was left here intentionally.
1383263 1386014 But his being here is a miracle, Elliott.
1387684 1389510 It's a miracle...
1390561 1393515 ...and you did the best that anybody could do.
1396901 1398940 I'm glad he met you first.
1408537 1409700 He's got DNA.
1411290 1412701 He's got DNA.<br />DNA?
1412791 1415543 He doesn't have four nucleotides like<br />we do. He has six.
1415627 1418747 I've got de-synchronization<br />of the two brain wave activities.
1421175 1422170 E.T!
1422259 1425710 The boy's condition is stabilizing.<br />Blood pressure's back up.
1426847 1428638 E.T.
1429975 1431599 Elliott.
1432310 1434184 He's speaking.<br />He's talking.
1434271 1435848 E. T...
1436523 1438100 ...stay with me.
1439943 1441188 Please.
1441277 1443069 Stay.
1443363 1444691 Together.
1446115 1448357 I'll be right here.
1448785 1450777 I'll be right here.
1453498 1455075 Stay...
1456459 1459294 ...Elliott.
1460838 1462416 Stay.
1464383 1465842 Stay.
1469555 1471013 Stay.
1473142 1474387 Stay.
1474643 1478012 The creature's pressure is bottoming out.<br />His complexes are slow.
1478105 1479729 How's the boy?
1480399 1483020 He's converting back to normal sinus rhythm.
1484778 1487814 They're separating.<br />Boy and creature are separating.
1487906 1491441 What does that mean?<br />Boy's coming back. We're losing E.T.
1491534 1494405 E.T., answer me, please.
1495830 1497408 Please.
1497832 1499113 Just relax.
1566691 1567805 No!
1567900 1569442 E.T., don't go!
1569777 1572897 - No blood pressure.<br />- He's got no pulse or respiration.
1574782 1579159 We can't get a pulse or blood pressure.<br />He's not breathing.
1582289 1585872 Leave him alone! You're killing him!
1586084 1587662 Leave him alone!
1587753 1589580 Let's move it!
1589838 1591878 Get the boy out.
1592049 1595500 Stop it! You're killing him!<br />You're killing him!
1597596 1600513 You're killing him! You're killing him!
1601057 1604391 You're killing him! He came to me!
1604477 1606102 Any pulses?
1606688 1608561 He came to me!
1614028 1615653 Minimal breath sounds.
1616072 1619571 Calm down. Calm.
1621244 1624410 Let's try some bretylium.<br />Can we have some bretylium?
1626207 1627749 Getting a pulse?
1627833 1630324 Compressed air. Compressed air's fine.
1635966 1639002 His pupils are fixed and dilated.
1639928 1641802 Defibrillate him.
1646476 1648848 Everybody, stand clear.<br />Clear.
1648937 1650645 We're losing him.
1653400 1654775 Quiet.
1655277 1657649 It's still defib.<br />Okay, let's go.
1657737 1659279 Let's go. Let's go.
1665829 1667157 Elliott?
1668915 1670160 Mom.
1684096 1685923 Let's continue CPR, please.
1701530 1703439 Would you people stand back?
1708537 1710280 Something's happening.
1711039 1713530 - They're going to die.<br />- Shut up, Greg.
1713625 1715534 Something is definitely happening.
1715627 1717454 Anybody have any ideas?
1717629 1720380 EKG's flat.<br />I'm going to call it.
1722717 1725006 - I think he's dead.<br />- No. I don't know.
1725094 1727799 I'm calling it. What time do you have?<br />15:36.
1728056 1730214 15 hours, 36 minutes.
1730808 1732267 Okay.
1732810 1734518 Let's pack him in ice.
1735688 1737348 Let's leave.
1803712 1805752 Is he dead, Mama?
1806215 1808041 I think so, sweetheart.
1808467 1811384 Can we wish for him to come back?
1812596 1814138 Yeah.
1814556 1816098 I wish.
1816850 1818428 I wish, too.
1827944 1831147 Come on, Gert.<br />We'll wait for Elliott in the front room.
1833741 1838035 Cardiac arrest was terminated<br />at 1500 hours and 36 minutes.
1838621 1840993 He received intravenous lidocaine...
1841082 1843833 ...intravenous epinephrine, a lidocaine drip...
1844335 1846873 ...2.7 percent sodium-chloride solution...
1847046 1849085 ...catheters from the "A" line.
1850716 1853088 The intravenous line should be sent for culture.
1853177 1855882 He was monitored with a...
1855971 1860882 ...EEG and an EKG, he was defibrillated...
1860976 1863681 They're going to have to take him away now.
1863771 1866178 They'll just cut him all up.
1868567 1871437 Would you like<br />to spend some time alone with him?
1886793 1889959 Could we all step out for a minute,<br />please?
1944182 1946554 Look at what they've done to you.
1949520 1951477 I'm so sorry.
1956819 1958776 You must be dead...
1960906 1962449 ...because...
1962533 1965368 ...I don't know how to feel.
1968831 1970989 I can't feel anything anymore.
1974336 1976708 You've gone someplace else now.
1985013 1987421 I'll believe in you all my life.
1989100 1990725 Every day.
1995523 1996804 E. T...
2000320 2001814 ...I love you.
2033560 2035304 Oh, my God.

2066968 2068759 Would you shut up?
2068844 2071133 Phone home. E.T. Phone home.

2075601 2077060 Phone home.

2078604 2079932 Elliott.
2081565 2082763 Stay.
2082858 2084269 Stay.
2099082 2102036 Elliott, why don't you come with me?<br />No.
2103712 2105585 No.
2109134 2110414 It's all right.
2111511 2113302 Would you like the flowers?
2117683 2120091 He's alive! He's alive!
2121896 2124138 He's glowing right here.
2134783 2136741 Are they gone, Mama?
2136869 2139490 - Who's gone, honey?<br />- The boys.
2139580 2140825 What boys?
2141415 2144499 I'm supposed to give you<br />this note when they're gone.
2146420 2148211 Give it to me now, Gertie.
2155762 2157387 Oh, my God.
2166439 2168348 Give me a hand with this.
2176532 2178691 - Where's your mask?<br />- Back here.
2178826 2180902 Well, get it on!<br />I'm trying!
2188544 2190038 Who are you?
2190129 2191753 I'm driving.
2193382 2194959 Open the door, son.
2195050 2199379 - There's a guy out here. What do I do?<br />- What are you waiting for? Let's go!
2200222 2202049 Let's get out of here!
2202266 2205136 I've never driven forward before!
2213777 2217359 Get the bikes. Meet us at the playground<br />at the top of the hill.
2217447 2218562 Let's do it!
2219699 2221241 Come on, Michael!
2238843 2242093 We'll all die, and they'll never give me my license.
2245057 2246516 Where's the playground?
2246600 2248474 It's near the preschool!
