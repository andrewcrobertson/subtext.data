135011 137888 You know<br />the first thing I thought
137889 139682 when I saw you?
140808 144687 I thought, "I want to make<br />a child with that person."
146772 149065 What if it's a her?
149066 151194 What would you call her?
152195 154321 Ragni, maybe.
154322 155906 Sorry?
155907 157532 Ragni.
157533 160827 Uh, let me think about<br />that for a second.
160828 163163 - Ragni.<br />- You hate it.
163164 164874 - Uh, boy's name?<br />- Texas.
166459 168126 You kidding me?
168127 170630 Texas is, like, a state,<br />you know? -I know.
171839 173673 There's about<br />three or four hours
173674 175008 till we reach the peak.
175009 176886 Ah, great.
183142 185852 Sweetie, can I just say<br />one last thing?
185853 188396 Then, I swear,<br />no more wedding talk.
188397 190857 - Of course.<br />- It's about the band.
190858 193443 But that is the one thing<br />you said I could handle myself,
193444 196029 and I've already made<br />my decision, Elsa.
196030 198073 Yeah, it's just that<br />I don't want
198074 200033 to use your brother's band.
200034 201618 - Why not?<br />- Honey...
201619 203078 He's super, super good.
203079 205038 - He works super hard.<br />- Yeah.
205039 206790 And-and he-he even takes<br />vocal lessons now.
206791 208375 Yeah, I know this.
208376 211169 I know this. It's just that,<br />um, well, Eric is no good.
211170 214839 I mean, he's, well,<br />terrible, actually.
214840 217301 His singing is like shit.
220763 223515 Hey. I mean, he has a nice b...
223516 225226 Olaf!
226018 228019 Olaf, I didn't mean to...<br />Oh, god.
228020 229604 Wait for me.
229605 231565 Why are you so sensitive?
237113 239073 Told you I could get us here.
245955 247872 It's beautiful.
247873 249833 Thank you. I love you.
262013 263513 Elsa.
263514 266559 - Look. Look.<br />- What is it? Hmm? Hmm?
267476 268936 - Look.
271522 273690 Quick, the camera.<br />Get the camera.
273691 276693 Oh, my, I've always wanted<br />to see a bear in real life.
276694 279362 First, humpbacks in Iceland,<br />and now this.
279363 281866 We have such good luck<br />in nature.
291125 292960 What do you see?
294378 295795 Hmm?
295796 298465 It's demented or something.
298466 299800 What?
303262 305013 Can I get the camera?<br />Give me the camera. -Yeah.
305014 307057 Demented?
307058 308600 I-I-I think we should leave it.
308601 310643 It's-it's something wrong<br />with it. Come on.
310644 312020 - Come on...<br />Ah!
312021 314482 Shh. Come on.<br />It's so cute.
315483 317984 Oh, there's nothing<br />to be afraid of, kristoffer.
317985 320404 I'm not afraid, Elsa.
321238 323866 Oh, sweetie, now, of course not.
326702 328162 Oh, fuck.
330081 331664 Don't panic.
331665 332832 What do we do?
332833 334376 "If it's black, fight back.
334377 336378 If it's brown, lay down."
336379 338046 But is it black or is it brown?
338047 339381 I mean, it looks brown to me.
339382 341174 We're in appalachia.<br />It's black.
341175 342884 - We have to fight it.<br />- How do you know?
342885 344929 You're not a bear expert.
346013 347555 Whatever you do, don't...
347556 349641 - Run! Where are we going?<br />- Oh-oh, no. Oh-oh, no.
349642 351562 - I said don't run! Stop! Stop!<br />- Uphill. Uphill.
353312 355021 Run!<br />- Where do we go?
355022 357399 - Run, Elsa! Run!<br />- Where do we go?
357400 359526 Oh, my god. Oh, my god!
359527 361736 - Run!
361737 363530 He's coming! Come on!
363531 365241 No! It's following...
371872 373665 Olaf! No!
373666 374917 God!
385177 386594 Help me!<br />- Come on! Come on!
386595 388556 Olaf!
412455 414123 This is drugs.
415458 417500 This is your brain on drugs.
417501 422172 It isn't glamorous<br />or cool or kid stuff.
422173 424424 The thrill can kill.
424425 429430 Smoking crack is like<br />putting a gun in your mouth...
431390 433642 And pulling the trigger.
436562 439689 Millions of dollars' worth of<br />cocaine dropped from the sky
439690 442775 early today onto a driveway<br />in Knoxville, Tennessee.
442776 444777 Kenley Jones reports tonight<br />it was found
444778 447280 on the body of a man<br />who fell to his death
447281 449283 when his parachute<br />failed to open.
450951 453870 The body of the heavily<br />armed parachutist was found
453871 456623 early this morning<br />by 85-year-old Fred Myers
456624 458625 and his neighbor, Ralph Johnson.
458626 460627 And you could see that<br />his main chute didn't open,
460628 462712 so I guess the loafers<br />was too much for him.
462713 465548 Police found more than<br />70 pounds of cocaine
465549 467634 wrapped in<br />football-size packages
467635 470679 in a duffel bag<br />the chutist was carrying.
475935 480105 Emergency chute deployed,<br />but didn't help much, I suppose.
480940 483149 Any narcotics found<br />with the plane wreckage?
483150 484817 Nothing.
484818 486945 Here's the I.D.
486946 488696 I know who that is.
488697 492242 Full name:<br />Andrew c. Thornton ii.
492243 494495 Man was out of his mind.
497039 499415 - What's the "c" stand for?<br />- Hmm?
499416 502670 You said "full name," but<br />you didn't say his full name.
506507 508675 Thornton was one of Syd<br />white's guys out of Missouri.
508676 511719 He's a known drug trafficker<br />with ties to Colombia.
511720 514681 Part of<br />the bluegrass conspiracy.
514682 518851 And there's more of this<br />out there.
518852 520896 They dumped it somewhere.
523440 525024 Hey, reba,<br />you have a dog, right?
525025 526859 Had.
526860 529571 Border collie. Barry.
529572 531990 Sorry for your loss.
531991 533992 Border collie, huh?
533993 536077 That's a cool dog.
536078 537412 Did he play fetch and stuff?
537413 538789 He loved fetch.
540708 542041 What?
542042 544002 Nothing. I just...
544003 546922 That's just awesome.
566025 567400 Damn it, Gabe.
567401 569153 Hi, daveed.
571071 573906 Uh, mind if I order first?
573907 575909 This won't take long.
581415 584168 Damn, I just bought these.
589548 592342 Hey, how's Gabe doing, anyway?
592343 594720 Did you hear about Thornton?
595471 596596 It's a tough way to go.
596597 598806 He only had 30 kilos on him.
598807 600768 Any idea where<br />we could find the rest?
601769 603269 Chattahoochee.
603270 604562 Georgia?
604563 606397 There's an area<br />called blood mountain.
606398 608274 When the plane's going down,
608275 610276 the pilots know<br />where to drop our load.
610277 611861 And then we just go and get it.
611862 615281 I don't need a bunch<br />of worried Colombians.
615282 617116 Now, I want you<br />to take Eddie with you.
617117 618493 Eddie's in mourning.
618494 620328 Joanie just died.
620329 621621 And he quit.
621622 623539 Joanie's the reason why he quit.
623540 625291 She's not here anymore.
625292 627460 The sooner he moves on,<br />the better.
627461 629671 Syd, I-I just don't...
629672 630880 Stop.
630881 633758 He won't even come<br />to get his goddamn son.
633759 637136 I am sick and tired<br />of watching my kid's kid.
637137 639556 Grandpa Syd, watch.
640641 642851 Yeah, that's great.
644853 647606 Got to go. Shift starts at 8:00.
648941 651276 Tomorrow's lunch is in<br />the fridge, and the chicken's...
653278 654862 Chicken's in the microwave.
654863 656740 Just hit "start."
657574 659659 Thought you were off tonight.
659660 661411 We talked about this, remember?
661412 662954 Me picking up some extra shifts?
662955 664497 You said you were okay with it.
664498 666207 I was okay with it<br />until I realized
666208 668167 why you want<br />those extra shifts...
668168 672506 So you could go and do overtime<br />with ray the pediatrician.
674049 676510 Gross, Dee Dee. Gross.
677678 680346 You know, he invited us<br />to go to Nashville
680347 681931 this weekend<br />to see his band play.
681932 684767 We were supposed to go paint<br />the waterfall this weekend.
684768 686644 I know, but it's gonna be fun.
686645 688187 We're gonna make<br />a whole weekend out of it.
688188 690106 It's Nashville.
690107 692818 He's a good guy, deirdra.
693902 695236 Just...
695237 696612 Give him a chance.
696613 698781 Please don't do that.
698782 700117 Do what?
701869 703870 You know what.
703871 706915 We'll paint the waterfall<br />another weekend, okay?
709042 711712 Close my door.
718886 721220 That's enough for today.
721221 723307 Wait, what?
724391 726310 Hey, Eddie.
727144 730689 They spelled her name wrong, daveed.
732149 734066 - It says "John."<br />- Oh.
734067 736402 - Says "John."<br />- Yeah.
736403 738571 - Her name is fucking Joan.<br />- Look, we...
738572 740740 - We could get it fixed.<br />- No.
740741 742742 I got to wait a week<br />for it to heal first.
742743 744911 I got seven more days of "John."
744912 746913 The chutist has been identified
746914 748706 as Andrew Thornton<br />of Paris, Kentucky.
748707 751042 - Wait, is that us?<br />- Hey.
751043 754879 Listen, Syd is worried<br />about you, all right?
754880 757466 Says you haven't seen Gabe<br />in weeks.
759468 762094 I'm so sad, man.
762095 764806 I'm so fucking sad.
764807 766642 Okay?
772564 775317 Can I get the, uh...<br />The penne, please?
776944 779111 Does it come with chicken,<br />or is it just, uh...
779112 781114 It's just plain.
792626 794377 I knew you'd be late.
794378 796587 It finally came in.<br />Check it out.
796588 798464 How many weeks' allowance<br />is that?
798465 800508 Like a thousand, but worth it.
800509 802343 - Can I use the toilet?<br />- Uh, no.
802344 804428 My mom is gonna be home soon.
804429 808599 And we got to go if we want<br />to get to the falls by lunch.
808600 810560 Why by lunch?
810561 812229 The light, Henry.
813355 815356 But I got to go pee.
815357 816774 Go outside.
816775 818651 Why do I skip school with you?
818652 821195 You're bossier than<br />the teachers.
821196 822780 Now, the adoption people...
822781 824949 I'm not sure who I talked to<br />over there...
824950 827159 Told me I was supposed to be<br />getting me a lab.
827160 830955 A fun one, a...<br />A man's-best-friend type.
830956 832665 I don't know<br />if there was an error,
832666 835501 because the one I got<br />is just kind of...
835502 837336 Bob?<br />- I don't know,
837337 838838 just kind of fancy.
838839 841549 Bob, captain says<br />it's time to go. -Got it.
841550 844052 Hey, look, I'm gonna<br />have to call you back.
845387 846929 Hey, reba.
846930 849182 You got plans for tonight?
850017 852810 Uh, Bob, you're a nice guy.
852811 855606 - I just don't...<br />- Mind looking after rosette?
856940 858524 - Oh.<br />- I have to go to Georgia
858525 859775 for the Thornton case,
859776 861485 and you said<br />you were good at dogs.
861486 863237 I said I had a dog.
863238 866032 You don't have jurisdiction<br />in Georgia.
866033 867742 A trucker overheard<br />a couple of guys
867743 869201 talking at a bar last night.
869202 872079 - I'll tell you in the car.<br />- No, no, no.
872080 873873 Pretty sure they're Syd's guys.
873874 876834 Oh, come on. You got to be<br />sort of good with them.
876835 879086 I only had her for a day.
879087 880630 Please?
880631 883216 Uh, I don't know if I could<br />trust anyone else around here.
885719 887053 Just go.
887054 888764 We'll be fine.
889556 891058 Thanks.
893101 895061 Can't believe<br />I left the backpack.
895062 896938 I can. I know the way.
896939 898773 School's gonna call, you know.
898774 900775 You know what? Let 'em.
900776 903235 And your mom's gonna be pissed.
903236 904779 So's your dad.
904780 906572 He doesn't care if I play hooky.
906573 908157 For a girl who likes<br />to be left alone,
908158 909909 you do a lot of shit<br />for attention.
909910 911577 Look, I'm not<br />ditching for attention.
911578 912912 I just want to paint<br />the waterfall.
912913 914246 Admit it.
914247 916249 You want her to find out<br />and worry about you.
946613 948907 - Jesus! Fuck!
949658 951033 Coral, it's sari.
951034 952660 Is Dee Dee over there?
952661 954620 School just called.

959334 961210 Yes, well, his daughter<br />just ditched school,
961211 964089 so can you please<br />just put him on?
965924 968134 Every time I call,<br />he's in the bathroom.
968135 970470 What the hell is wrong with him?
971388 973306 Never mind.

1104771 1106522 - Yeah, but...<br />- And animals.
1106523 1109817 Forest fires are the number one<br />cause of death for wildlife.
1109818 1111944 Yeah, and y-you should be<br />educating yourself
1111945 1114113 instead of endangering<br />the entire ecosystem.
1114114 1115865 Just get out of here.
1115866 1118450 - Get out.
1118451 1120579 Unbelievable.
1121997 1123873 You got a dusty beaver here, ranger.
1123874 1125959 Yeah, well, I'm working on that.
1148523 1151066 Hey, Henry!
1151067 1153944 It looks like the deer<br />on this sign are doing it!
1153945 1155488 Hold on.
1157115 1159701 Seriously, what the hell<br />are you even doing?
1160702 1162119 Marking our territory.
1162120 1163996 Ugh! Don't shit out here!
1163997 1167667 I'm not shitting.
1170337 1173422 Hey. Did your mom pack<br />double lunch for school again?
1173423 1176008 My dad didn't have a chance<br />to make any.
1176009 1177677 Hey, Henry.
1187687 1189564 Check it out.
1192901 1194610 It's drugs, I think.
1194611 1196237 It's drugs?
1196238 1198405 Remember that guy from assembly?
1198406 1201533 He showed us pictures of stuff<br />that looked just like this.
1201534 1203452 Yeah. The guy from Vietnam<br />with no legs.
1203453 1205079 No.
1205080 1207373 This is definitely cocaine.
1207374 1208874 Yeah. Of course.
1208875 1211710 I'm just not used to<br />seeing it like that.
1211711 1215799 You know, it's usually<br />more powdery on the streets.
1216967 1219051 When have you seen cocaine<br />on the streets?
1219052 1220386 When I do it.
1220387 1221512 Oh, yeah?
1221513 1222596 With who?
1222597 1224056 With faulk.
1224057 1225391 After church.
1225392 1227393 Faulk does not do cocaine<br />after church.
1227394 1229019 Are you friends with faulk?
1229020 1230187 No. He's a pervert.
1230188 1231647 Then you wouldn't know.
1231648 1232898 Liar.
1232899 1235150 You're just mad<br />you're never invited.
1235151 1237194 I don't care I'm not invited.
1237195 1239447 Sounds like you care.
1240407 1242242 Do some, then.
1243827 1245536 What?
1245537 1247663 You've done it before.<br />You can do it again.
1247664 1251583 Well, uh, we're exercising,<br />though. Shooting and stuff.
1251584 1254712 I mean, I can't do cocaine<br />while shooting and exercising.
1254713 1256297 That wouldn't be good.
1256298 1257589 Fine.
1257590 1259092 Knife me.
1267600 1270562 Okay, so how do I do it?
1271521 1272731 You eat it.
1273690 1274773 How much?
1274774 1277444 Like a tablespoon's worth.
1288538 1290080 Oh!
1290081 1293042 - Son of a bitch!
1293043 1296129 Oh, what the hell?
1297005 1298882 - Rookie.
1300884 1302551 You do it, then.
1302552 1304429 Ugh.
1317734 1320652 - Ah, shit!
1320653 1322488 What the hell?
1322489 1324866 This isn't as good<br />as the shit I normally do.
1327494 1329788 Ugh!
1331164 1333499 How much do you think<br />this stuff is worth?
1333500 1335459 Let's sell drugs together.
1335460 1338796 Yeah, we could sell them on<br />the street like you and faulk.
1338797 1341508 There's more.
1343676 1345011 Ow.
1346679 1349681 Something got into it.
1349682 1351141 A deer, maybe.
1351142 1353352 Could you imagine that?<br />Deer on cocaine?
1353353 1354853 It'd be like this.
1354854 1357648 Yeah, it'd be, like,<br />going into trees like... bang!
1357649 1359400 - Bang!<br />- Yep, and then it'd get stuck.
1359401 1361860 Yeah, and then it'd be so sad.
1361861 1365030 Hey, Dee Dee. Do you think<br />my dad has ever done cocaine?
1365031 1367992 Your dad has definitely<br />done cocaine.
1370662 1372539 My throat's really runny.
1375542 1377627 Stop that.
1389889 1392391 Did it do the cocaine?
1392392 1395228 Don't move a muscle.
1401443 1402985 Listen to me.
1402986 1406238 You were supposed to grab Eddie,<br />not run your mouth.
1406239 1408365 Now we have trouble.<br />You understand? -Got it.
1408366 1410534 - I'll take care of it.
1410535 1412703 Gabe, knock that off. Gabe.
1412704 1415038 Grandpa Syd!<br />Gabe, driving me nuts.

1464297 1466925 I'm sorry I didn't, you know...

1469844 1471678 No, I could've did more.
1471679 1472804 It's fine.
1472805 1473889 I should've been there.
1473890 1475224 I didn't need you there.
1475225 1476558 I don't hang out<br />with drug dealers anymore.
1476559 1478143 It's against my constitution.
1478144 1480103 I'm more than a drug dealer.

1494160 1496995 if we can call it that.

1502919 1504169 I know.
1504170 1506255 Maybe he gave her the cancer.
1506256 1507673 You can't give no one cancer.
1507674 1509341 Yes, you can. With stress.
1509342 1511385 Stop protecting him.

1541916 1543750 13, come through here?<br />My daughter...
1543751 1545794 You lost your daughter<br />in the park.
1545795 1548422 Well, she came here on her own,<br />heading to the waterfall.
1548423 1551508 Yeah. Hikers under 16 must be<br />accompanied by an adult.
1551509 1553343 Well, I didn't know<br />she was coming here.

1573823 1575365 Now, Peter,<br />the wildlife inspection
1575366 1576742 is a very important process.
1576743 1578285 We wouldn't want you distracted
1578286 1580245 by our little<br />damsel in distress here.
1580246 1581788 Nothing can distract me
1581789 1584416 from making sure<br />the entire biological community
1584417 1586209 is safe for all our friends.

1587837 1589796 - He means animals.<br />- I don't like that word.
1589797 1592257 He doesn't like<br />to call them animals.
1592258 1594677 Well, I won't be a burden.
1596429 1598431 I'll get my hat.
1599474 1600933 Okay.
1605229 1606813 Shoes okay for hiking?
1606814 1608732 Oh, yeah.<br />I-I think I'll be okay.
1608733 1610609 I have on boots.<br />- Yep.
1610610 1612277 Come on, Eddie.
1612278 1613987 I'm done playing this game.
1613988 1615238 You-you wanted...
1615239 1616823 You were the one<br />who wanted to play this.
1616824 1618784 You still have<br />three more questions.
1618785 1620953 Listen.<br />What?
1622664 1624206 I'm tired of playing<br />this fucking game.
1624207 1625957 No, you're not.<br />You just don't want to lose.
1625958 1628795 I'm-a go in here<br />and take a piss, all right?
1633549 1636385 I didn't know<br />rangers carried guns.
1636386 1638804 Park rangers are peace officers.
1638805 1641139 Which means we can shoot people.
1641140 1643600 Forest is a dangerous place.
1643601 1645852 That gang of pubes<br />are dangerous.
1645853 1647229 "Gang of pubes"?
1647230 1648606 Teens. Delinquents.
1650733 1653151 They've been attacking hikers.
1653152 1654653 They hurt anyone?
1654654 1656948 They cut them with a knife.
1658116 1660325 Call themselves the doochamps.
1660326 1662203 Watch your back.
1663329 1665831 Pop-art punks<br />pop up out of nowhere.
1665832 1668209 Out of nowhere.
1681472 1683141 Fuck is this?
1684517 1687227 He's afraid, buds.
1687228 1689020 Empty your pockets.
1689021 1690439 No.
1690440 1693025 Empty your pockets, please.
1694694 1697530 Since you asked so nicely.
1699574 1702325 You think this is a joke?
1702326 1703910 I do.
1703911 1705704 Get him, buds.
1705705 1707372 I'm shaking<br />a fucking knife, man. Come on.
1707373 1709207 Just stab him. -Come on, man.<br />It's a fucking knife!
1709208 1710793 - Go on!
1713838 1715714 Oh!
1715715 1717215 Come on, rocky. Come on, rocky.
1717216 1718801 - Come on, rocky.<br />- Ah! Banzai!
1720845 1723055 Give me this fucking board!
1724724 1726559 You're going down, man!
1733441 1735317 Submit! Submit!
1735318 1736736 What the...
1739572 1741239 Hold this!
1741240 1743701 Aah! Fucking skateboard!
1756088 1757548 Oh, my.
1771437 1773480 The fuck is wrong with y'all?!
1773481 1775107 Shit!
1776108 1777609 I love this road.
1777610 1779152 Ah, love it up there.
1779153 1781279 So, wait, where is it<br />that you wanted to go again?
1781280 1782781 What? The falls.
1782782 1784157 The secret falls. Right, well,<br />we can go up this way
1784158 1785784 - or take the loop.<br />I love the loop.
1785785 1787494 Well, you can see<br />the top of the...
1787495 1789454 This is a more direct...
1789455 1791331 All right. We're going this way.
1791332 1792999 Well, crap.
1793000 1795585 Told you she shouldn't<br />have come with us.
1795586 1797671 Just distracting you completely.
1797672 1799172 She can hear you.
1799173 1801759 I wanted to get up<br />to see the sunset.
1803010 1805303 - What's taking you so long?
1805304 1807265 What'd you do?
1817149 1819609 Please tell me<br />you found them like this.
1819610 1820652 They attacked me.
1820653 1821820 Are they dead?
1821821 1823196 Well, one might be.
1823197 1825700 The-the one that stabbed me<br />might be dead.
1827702 1830787 Jesus chr... they're kids.
1830788 1833123 I loved this fucking Jersey, man.
1833124 1834583 Okay, they're fine.
1834584 1836710 Thank god.
1836711 1838337 No fucking way.
1840381 1841674 Daveed?
1849307 1850515 What happened?
1850516 1851600 Hey.
1851601 1852851 - Wake up.
1852852 1854394 Where'd you find this?
1854395 1855854 Whoa.
1855855 1858481 Where is this energy<br />coming from, bud?
1858482 1860025 You tried to fucking kill me.
1860026 1862485 You got a foul mouth there, bud.
1862486 1864654 I tell him that all the time.
1864655 1866573 Where did you find this?
1866574 1868366 Up on the mountain.
1868367 1869451 Where's the rest of it?
1869452 1871328 I don't know.
1871329 1874998 Listen, I just took out<br />the three of you in 15 seconds.
1874999 1876541 What do you think I'll do<br />to just you
1876542 1878752 when you're already<br />on the floor?
1878753 1880795 Okay. Okay.
1880796 1883548 We stashed it under a gazebo.
1883549 1885425 Going back for it later tonight.
1885426 1887385 A gazebo?
1887386 1890555 It's a pavilion-type structure.
1890556 1892349 I know what the fuck<br />a gazebo is.
1892350 1894185 I didn't.
1895227 1897062 Are my buds dead?
1897063 1898730 - Show us where.<br />- Oh, god.
1898731 1900899 You know,<br />i-I'm feeling kind of tired.
1900900 1902400 I think I should rest.
1902401 1904402 Okay. Want a dirt nap?
1904403 1905820 Eddie, go get the gun.
1905821 1907238 It's in the glove.
1907239 1908573 I prefer we left guns<br />out of this.
1908574 1910533 Yeah. Same.
1910534 1913578 And I would prefer<br />not to be stabbed.
1913579 1916456 So, Eddie, please go get<br />the fucking gun.
1916457 1918250 Okay.
1919335 1920752 Okay.
1920753 1921920 All right, all right.
1921921 1923923 All right, I'm coming.
1924674 1926008 Relax.
1934850 1936936 It's getting real cold out.
1951909 1954495 Let's go.
1956956 1958623 So, where you guys from?
1958624 1960333 Shut up. Keep walking.
1960334 1962961 Gonna be a long hike<br />if we can't talk to each other.
1962962 1964963 It better not be a long hike.
1964964 1966297 Friend's<br />pretty serious, ain't he?
1966298 1967966 Well, I don't think<br />he's too happy
1967967 1969634 after getting stabbed<br />in the shoulder.
1969635 1971469 Well, it wasn't me.
1971470 1972971 Eh, I don't blame him, though.
1972972 1974472 Getting stabbed sucks.

2012219 2013846 Bye.
2015890 2017474 Look at this.
2017475 2018850 Oh, no.
2018851 2021102 Look at this mess.
2021103 2023146 People don't have any respect.
2023147 2025106 This is gonna end up<br />in scat, this plastic.
2025107 2026399 I... let me pick that up.
2026400 2028693 - All right. Thank you, ranger.<br />- Dee Dee!
2028694 2030653 That is sticking.<br />- I got some oil in the car.
2030654 2031863 Dee Dee! Henry!
2031864 2033364 'Cause if that stays open,
2033365 2035200 - critters can get in there.<br />- Oh, yeah, critters.
2035201 2037285 What kind of critters? Huh?
2037286 2038912 - Squirrels?<br />- Squirrels could get in there.
2038913 2041122 Chipmunks?<br />- Yeah, chipmunks get in there.
2041123 2042749 - Dee Dee!<br />Uh, skunks.
2042750 2044209 Raccoon, you know,<br />little burglar.
2044210 2046044 - That's right.<br />- Got his own little mask on.
2046045 2047045 Yeah, with their cute little<br />outfit. -I think they're cute.
2047046 2048505 Uh, skunks.
2048506 2049672 Skunks. Hmm.
2049673 2050799 - Possums.<br />Possums.
2050800 2051966 - Definitely possums.<br />- Possum.
2051967 2054052 - Uh...<br />- Hey, possum.
2054053 2056221 Mrs. Mckinndry!
2056222 2057597 Henry?
2057598 2059390 Here! Hello?
2059391 2060642 Henry?
2060643 2062228 Up here!
2064063 2066231 Hey. Whoa.<br />Oh.
2066232 2068191 Henry, what are you<br />doing up there?
2068192 2069275 No.
2069276 2071069 - No, that's not safe at all.<br />No.
2071070 2073238 It's too high.<br />You got to come down.
2073239 2074322 Get down here.
2074323 2077117 Don't be mad,<br />but we skipped school.
2077118 2078952 - No shit, Henry.<br />It's high.
2078953 2080495 But there was a bear.
2080496 2081830 A really terrible bear.
2081831 2083289 - A bear?<br />- Yeah, I know.
2083290 2085416 - It was fucked!<br />Hey!
2085417 2087210 That's inappropriate.
2087211 2090588 Sorry for cussing,<br />but it attacked me and Dee Dee.
2090589 2092048 It attacked you?
2092049 2094050 - Henry, where is Dee Dee?<br />No, no.
2094051 2096052 Bears are<br />very peaceful creatures.
2096053 2097762 You must have done something<br />to upset it.
2097763 2099722 - Yeah, did you feed it?<br />- What did you do?
2099723 2101808 Nothing! Y'all need to hide!
2101809 2104644 I'm telling you,<br />it's not just any bear!
2104645 2106688 You have to listen to me!
2106689 2108565 Henry, where is Dee Dee?
2108566 2110108 The monster took her.
2110109 2113444 Now, I'm not gonna<br />tell you again, little girl.
2113445 2115071 Get down here now.
2115072 2117615 - A...
2117616 2119742 - I...
2119743 2121453 Dee Dee!
2138470 2140514 Whoa!
2142474 2143766 Peter!
2143767 2145644 - No!<br />- Peter!
2149857 2152025 Oh! Oh, no!
2152026 2153860 It let me go! He ran off!
2153861 2157071 - Henry, jump down.<br />- It's too high.
2157072 2158531 Is it gone?
2158532 2160451 Do you see it?
2167875 2169250 Yeah.
2169251 2171544 Why are you shooting at me?
2171545 2172754 Get your ass down!
2172755 2174172 This is your fault.
2174173 2175716 Right behind you. I saw it.
2176926 2178177 Stay down.
2186894 2189021 What?
2206622 2208123 Help me!
2208916 2210793 Help!
2215089 2217882 Ranger! Ranger!
2217883 2219259 Did it get you?
2219260 2221803 That asshole!
2221804 2223096 I'm gonna get him.
2223097 2224640 I'm gonna get that asshole.
2227935 2229227 I'll get help.
2229228 2230728 Where are you going?
2230729 2232063 God almighty.
2232064 2234233 Hey. What...
2235734 2237236 Where is it?
2238821 2240447 Hey!
2242866 2244659 What should I do?
2244660 2246160 Motherfucker!
2246161 2247579 Come back! Help us!
2249873 2251833 Oh, fuck!
2257006 2258423 There's something wrong with it.
2258424 2260008 Yeah, I told you there was.
2260009 2262218 Why is it acting like this?
2262219 2264262 Did you feed it cocaine?
2264263 2266639 No. But you're safe.
2266640 2268599 Bears can't climb trees.
2268600 2269892 Of course they can!
2269893 2271854 Then why are you up here?
2297338 2300299 It's okay. It's okay.
2317608 2319360 Okay.
2335584 2336835 No.
2339254 2342090 Henry, climb. Henry, go.
2342091 2344509 Climb! Climb!<br />You got to get higher!
2344510 2346052 - Climb.<br />Go, Henry!
2346053 2347345 Go!
2347346 2349473 - Henry, move!<br />- Go higher!
2352017 2353351 Go up!
2353352 2355436 Henry, go!
2355437 2357314 Oh, god.
2359108 2360817 Go, Henry! No!<br />- Whoa!
2360818 2362026 No!
2362027 2364071 Oh, god. Henry!
2379002 2380963 Oh, god.
2382673 2384466 Oh, shit.
2388011 2390180 No, no, no, no!
2392724 2395309 Get off of me! No, no!
2395310 2397646 - Get off! Get off of me!
2403819 2405862 Henry, jump! Jump down!
2405863 2407948 - Move, Henry!
2414413 2416664 It's okay. It's okay.<br />You're doing great.
2416665 2419250 You're almost there.<br />Come on, baby.
2419251 2421586 - Come on. Let's go.
2421587 2423547 Come on.
2442232 2444735 Go. Hide. Come here. Come here.
2449406 2451408 That was so messed up.
2452284 2454827 That little man<br />was an expert on bears
2454828 2457788 but didn't know the bear<br />was the cocaine bear.
2457789 2459499 Wait. What did you say?
2459500 2460958 We found cocaine,<br />Mrs. Mckinndry.
2460959 2462793 There was cocaine in the forest,<br />and the bear ate it
2462794 2465296 and then went crazy<br />on me and Dee Dee
2465297 2467798 and now on that guy back there.
2467799 2469675 Did you hear him scream?
2469676 2471928 He's so dead.
2471929 2474430 I'd love to not remember that.
2474431 2476432 But it kind of seems like
2476433 2478977 the thing that stays<br />with a man forever.
2479937 2483147 Henry, when the bear<br />took Dee Dee, was she...
2483148 2485149 Alive? Yeah.
2485150 2486818 It chased her that way.
2487819 2489655 We got to go. Let's go.
2492324 2493991 He get at you, too?
2493992 2496827 - Fucking beast.<br />- Yeah, you can say that again.
2496828 2499623 - Call an ambulance.<br />- I already did.
2501875 2503417 Keep him awake.
2503418 2505879 Yeah, I've been trying.
2521228 2523396 You piles of shit!
2523397 2525982 - You're the doochamps!<br />- Hey, that's-that's not ours.
2525983 2527651 We found it.
2530320 2532573 "It's not ours."
2533448 2535032 I'm a park ranger.
2535033 2537201 - I'm not dumb.<br />- I know.
2537202 2538869 They say I can't keep<br />my park safe,
2538870 2541372 that I'm unfit<br />for the big leagues.
2541373 2543291 I'd have been<br />at yellowstone by now
2543292 2544375 if it weren't for you shits!
2544376 2545876 - Buds.<br />Huh?
2545877 2548754 There's someone outside.
2548755 2551549 It's him. Get to the door.<br />Get to the door.
2551550 2552758 - Yeah.
2552759 2556679 Now, uh, open it<br />when I-I count to three.
2556680 2558681 Wait, wait.<br />But you're gonna shoot him?
2558682 2560182 Hell yes, I'm gonna shoot him!
2560183 2561601 He took a bite out of my ass!
2561602 2564021 What the fuck is wrong<br />with this guy?
2565439 2567733 Now, open it when I say so.
2570068 2571570 Now.
2574239 2576450 That's a fucking bear.
2582289 2584458 What the fuck?!
2592257 2593424 I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.
2593425 2594759 - You're sorry?<br />- I'm sorry.
2594760 2597178 - Where'd the bear go?<br />- You killed him.
2597179 2598262 Where's the bear?!
2598263 2600014 - I don't know!<br />- Close the door!
2600015 2603809 - Close the motherfucking door.<br />- Jesus Christ.
2603810 2606063 Close the door.
2607314 2610150 Oh, god. I'm sorry, bud.
2615947 2619076 Keep your mouth shut.<br />Check over there.
2641807 2644226 Shh.
2647396 2649355 He's up there.
2649356 2650816 He's up there.
2681054 2684641 I got it. I got it.
2694818 2696527 Maybe the kid can help you.
2696528 2698696 Look, I'm done<br />playing this game.
2698697 2700531 - What game?<br />- 20 questions.
2700532 2703033 Daveed's so fucking cold.<br />It's unbelievable.
2703034 2705536 - What did he ask so far?<br />- He just keeps guessing.
2705537 2707663 Like, "is it a spider?
2707664 2709707 - Is it an arrow?"
2709708 2712085 What are you, new?
2713086 2715087 Hey, start broad,<br />then narrow it down.
2715088 2716380 Everybody knows that.
2716381 2718174 Look, are we close<br />to the gazebo?
2718175 2719759 Is that one of your questions?
2719760 2721469 Oh, is it bigger<br />than a bread box?
2721470 2723722 No, no, no. Daveed needs to ask.
2724598 2727058 Ask him if it's bigger<br />than a bread box.
2728226 2730771 Is it bigger than a bread box?
2732063 2733230 - Yes.<br />- Whoo!
2733231 2734565 Yeah!
2734566 2736358 Is it Abraham Lincoln?
2736359 2738527 What? No.
2738528 2741739 Broad, then narrow it down, man.
2741740 2743909 You have one question left.
2799589 2802675 Dee Dee! Dee Dee!
2802676 2804301 You sure this is the way?
2804302 2806388 Pretty sure.
2811685 2813477 Dee Dee! It's okay.
2813478 2815146 It's mama.
2816481 2818650 Oh.
2819484 2821360 Thank god.
2821361 2823320 - Ew! What the heck?
2823321 2825614 It's paint. It's just red paint.
2825615 2828158 It looks a lot like blood.<br />How can you be sure?
2828159 2830119 I'm a nurse, Henry.
2830120 2831830 Good point.
2832914 2834708 Come on.
2839045 2841006 Oh, smart girl.
2843008 2845259 Henry, come on.<br />She left us a trail.
2845260 2848512 Mrs. Mckinndry,<br />have you ever done cocaine?
2848513 2850180 What?
2850181 2852349 Why do you ask?
2852350 2854852 Just wondering if it has<br />long-term side effects...
2854853 2858105 For the bear, of course,<br />if it just did a little bit.
2858106 2861525 Well, it could create<br />a habit for the bear.
2861526 2864028 What if they never want<br />to do it again?
2864029 2866697 Oh, then it-it should be fine.
2866698 2869575 But mama bear and papa bear<br />would be very angry
2869576 2871827 because drugs...<br />Especially cocaine...
2871828 2873996 Are very, very bad.
2873997 2875748 What if they would<br />never find out?
2875749 2877374 Oh, Henry.
2877375 2879585 We always find out.

3242407 3246619 Like, what-what do you say to<br />a kid who just lost his mommy?
3247662 3250914 My mom is the reason<br />I'm the man I am today.
3250915 3252416 And what a man you are.
3252417 3254501 Attacking innocent people<br />for no reason.
3254502 3255752 Can you not?
3255753 3257921 I'm sorry. Just continue.
3257922 3259923 Well, when my daddy died,
3259924 3262259 my mama bought me<br />this pet lizard.
3262260 3264219 It was the coolest little thing.
3264220 3266388 It had all these<br />green scales on it.
3266389 3268807 She used to call it<br />a tiny dinosaur.
3268808 3270475 I thought that was so awesome.
3270476 3273186 I was real bad<br />at connecting with people,
3273187 3274896 but I practiced<br />conversation starters
3274897 3276690 on that lizard every day.
3276691 3279861 And then<br />that's how I met rocky and Joe.
3281279 3282779 That's my team, man.
3282780 3286200 We're planning on moving<br />to New York City together.
3286951 3290120 Those are my buds, man.
3290121 3292748 So I should get Gabe a lizard?
3292749 3295459 Well, you know what?
3295460 3299129 Lizards are good listeners, bud,
3299130 3301173 but people...
3301174 3303760 People are good at hearing.
3307597 3310974 That's the sweetest thing<br />I ever heard. Thank you.
3310975 3312601 - Can we...<br />- It's okay.
3312602 3314728 Y'all are hugging.
3314729 3317190 It's okay.
3319984 3321903 Where the fuck is the gazebo?
3395435 3399272 Can I say something without you<br />getting angry with me?
3400398 3402733 I'm already angry with you.
3406070 3407905 It's gone.
3408865 3410240 What the actual...
3410241 3411741 - No! Please, please!<br />- Daveed, stop.
3411742 3413285 No, no, no. The kid's<br />messing with us, Eddie.
3413286 3414661 No, no, no! I'm not!<br />I'm not! I'm not!
3414662 3416329 I-I promise.<br />I-I don't know where it went.
3416330 3417706 It's just gone.
3417707 3419875 Okay, well,<br />duffel bags don't have legs.
3419876 3422085 Since you're the only one<br />that knew where it was,
3422086 3424337 i'm-a give you one more chance.
3424338 3425964 Where's the ba...
3425965 3428926 Put the gun down<br />and move away from the teenager.
3430553 3435265 Drop the weapon and step away<br />about five to ten paces.
3435266 3437851 All right, listen.<br />Just calm down, all right?
3437852 3439270 I ain't fucking around.
3440021 3442440 Just do it.
3444108 3445776 Fuck.
3446652 3448862 - You don't want to do this.<br />- Shut up!
3448863 3451532 I'm coming down there.
3458289 3460458 Uh...
3462877 3466672 Uh...
3468299 3471009 - Uh...
3471010 3471969 Shh!
3471970 3473970 I'm just trying to...
3473971 3476097 Find a safe spot to hop down.
3476098 3477807 How did you get up there?
3477808 3480143 Well, I jumped from that tree<br />over there, but...
3480144 3481645 I hurt my hip a little.
3481646 3483355 I can try to catch you<br />if you want.
3483356 3486943 No, no!<br />You stay right where you are!
3488152 3489986 Let's, uh, see, uh...
3489987 3491280 Get it.
3493282 3495784 Fuck!
3495785 3497161 Fuck!
3498538 3500163 Well, you brought that<br />on yourself, kid.
3500164 3502999 Oh, yeah?<br />I shot my own fucking fingers?
3503000 3504543 I told you not to move.
3504544 3507629 How'd he take<br />those two fingers off?
3507630 3509674 They're not even<br />next to each other.
3511342 3513010 Fuck you!
3514303 3515845 Come out of there!
3515846 3517430 Shit! Come on out!
3517431 3519350 No fucking way!
3520977 3522728 God! Goddamn it!
3524021 3526022 You two, on your bellies.
3526023 3528067 Now! And no more moving.
3529360 3531152 Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!
3531153 3532445 Can you grab them for me?
3532446 3533863 Can I grab his fingers?
3533864 3535533 Okay. Get 'em. Get 'em.
3536742 3538578 Slow. Slow.
3541372 3542539 Easy.
3542540 3544083 Ugh, god.
3545835 3547544 All right.
3547545 3549170 Now, you get back on your belly.
3549171 3551048 I'll hold on to these.
3557096 3558764 Now, where you at?
3560141 3561892 Shit.
3563227 3564436 What?
3564437 3565980 Oh, no. The river.
3568190 3570066 Henry, look.
3570067 3572068 That's Dee Dee's sweater.
3572069 3574362 - Come on.<br />- So we're crossing?
3574363 3576156 We're on the right track.
3576157 3577867 I can feel it.
3593924 3595926 Mama?
3597094 3599304 Fuck.
3599305 3601139 Fuck, man.
3601140 3603601 My fucking Jersey, man.
3605645 3607771 How long are you gonna<br />keep us like this?
3607772 3609439 Until that guy in the gazebo
3609440 3611191 throws his weapon<br />into the woods.
3611192 3613151 Well, then we'll be here forever.
3613152 3615654 Hasn't Syd already<br />messed your life up enough?
3615655 3617530 We don't need to die<br />because of this.
3617531 3619532 Eddie, I got this.
3619533 3620784 Do you?
3620785 3623620 I have your fingers<br />in my pocket.
3623621 3625288 You're all gonna get arrested.
3625289 3627582 Drug sentences since Nixon<br />are fucked,
3627583 3630335 so get ready for ten to 15 years
3630336 3632420 of shitting<br />in front of your cellmate
3632421 3634130 and supervised shower time.
3634131 3636633 Detective, your honor, sir,<br />I'm not with them.
3636634 3638385 I've never even done coke.
3638386 3641471 I mean, maybe once.<br />Once... at a party once.
3641472 3643640 - I can't go to jail.<br />- You're not going to jail.
3643641 3645183 Just saying, I can't shit<br />in front of people.
3645184 3647143 I've never been able to shit<br />in front of people.
3647144 3649063 I like to shit in peace.
3654485 3656779 Nobody move.
3658239 3659531 It's a bear.
3659532 3661199 Yeah.
3661200 3662951 No, no.
3662952 3665830 I'm not falling<br />for none of your...
3688519 3689936 Oh, fuck.
3689937 3692188 Hey, y'all just stay still.<br />Don't move.
3692189 3693566 Just play dead.
3719550 3721051 Shh.
3747828 3748913 Oh, fuck.
3758088 3759255 Oh, man. You fucked.
3759256 3760381 Eddie, can you breathe?
3760382 3762342 What the fuck?
3762343 3763928 I think that's a yes.
3764762 3766513 Can someone do something?
3766514 3767931 Maybe your boy can do something.
3767932 3771768 Can you just, like... move it?
3771769 3774688 Oh, of course.<br />Why didn't I think of that?
3778400 3779984 Dee Dee!
3779985 3783113 Henry, stay close.<br />I haven't seen paint in a while.
3785449 3787116 Oh, god.
3787117 3789077 Look.
3789078 3790830 Hello.
3792164 3795583 - Is he okay?
3795584 3798461 Help me, please.
3798462 3800421 Does he have food?
3800422 3802799 Her name was Elsa,
3802800 3805219 and she was so beautiful.
3806554 3808388 Are-are you... are you hurt?
3808389 3810640 Were you attacked?
3810641 3812393 Devil bear.
3813352 3814602 My... I'm looking<br />for my daughter.
3814603 3815812 She was attacked<br />by the devil bear.
3815813 3817021 Have you seen her?
3817022 3818565 You have?
3818566 3820775 - Was she alive?<br />Yes.
3820776 3822318 Please, can you just point<br />to where she went?
3822319 3824237 Please, can you show me?<br />I'm looking for her.
3824238 3825280 I haven't...
3825281 3826824 Henry!
3839295 3843007 I'll show you. Come.
3848345 3850264 It's not moving.
3851640 3853600 I think it died.
3853601 3855685 It died on top of me?
3855686 3856936 Check its pulse.
3856937 3859522 Can you, like,<br />feel it breathing?
3859523 3861859 I'm not sure.
3863444 3866029 Uh, hey, guy?
3866030 3867155 Detective.
3867156 3868197 Can we call a truce
3868198 3870199 so I can see<br />if the bear is dead?
3870200 3871410 Yeah.
3876040 3877166 Fuck.
3881712 3883630 You okay?
3883631 3885883 What do you think?
3903275 3905068 S-Still breathing.
3905069 3907403 We should go.
3907404 3909781 He'll probably be all right.
3909782 3911866 What the hell, man?
3911867 3913242 He's gonna wake up eventually.
3913243 3915286 Well, that's exactly<br />what I'm afraid of.
3915287 3916579 "She."
3916580 3917914 What?
3917915 3919749 The bear is a girl.
3919750 3921292 Oh, yeah.<br />H-How do you know that?
3921293 3924380 Because its vagina is on my ear.
3926548 3928299 Oh, shit. She's moving.
3928300 3929717 She's awake.
3929718 3932095 Oh, shit.<br />Well, stay back. Stay back.
3932096 3934765 Okay.
3939645 3940645 Chill out. Just chill out!
3940646 3942605 Ooh. Homes, hey, hey.
3942606 3944316 - Stay back.
3948445 3949946 What the hell?
3949947 3952783 Okay. Okay.
3955327 3957955 No, no, no, no.<br />Don't eat that. Don't eat that.
3958664 3960623 I will be goddamned.
3960624 3962125 Should we shoot her?
3962126 3965587 No. Let's see what kind<br />of effect that has on it.
3967131 3969466 What the fuck?
3982146 3984814 - No, no, no, no, no, no!
3984815 3986733 - Eddie!<br />Daveed, help.
3986734 3989360 What is this?
3989361 3990820 - No, no.
3990821 3992572 - Ooh! Okay, I have...<br />What is it doing?
3992573 3994323 I-I don't like this.
3994324 3995742 Please stop.
3995743 3997828 - Just go limp! Slide down!<br />- I'm limp already.
3999580 4001789 - Shoot the bear! Shoot her!<br />Don't shoot!
4001790 4003958 No, no. Don't shoot.<br />Don't shoot.
4003959 4005084 Eddie, you got to fight back,<br />all right?
4005085 4006169 It's-it's playing with you.
4006170 4007670 I'd stay still if I were you.
4007671 4009881 Bud, just tap out, bud.<br />Bud, tap out!
4009882 4012300 Eddie, please don't die<br />like this. Eddie, please.
4012301 4013551 Daveed!
4013552 4015344 All we've been through! Come on!
4015345 4016679 Come on, help him!
4016680 4018681 Get lower. You're not listening!
4018682 4021017 - Eddie.
4021018 4022811 Oh, my god. He's gonna die.
4025147 4026355 No!
4026356 4028067 Hey, girl.
4036700 4038452 There you go, girl.
4039536 4041205 There you go.
4042790 4044707 There you go.
4044708 4048212 It's like cocaine Christmas.
4063227 4064393 Go!
4064394 4067314 Don't have to tell me twice.
4069733 4071400 Come on!
4071401 4072485 Daveed!
4072486 4074070 That bag's worth 14 million.
4074071 4077073 We had a truce, and a truce<br />is on god where I'm from.
4077074 4080701 Can't you see I'm trying<br />to help you, kid? Go!
4080702 4082411 I need that bag.
4082412 4084497 Leave it, man.<br />Let's just go home.
4084498 4087084 We're taking that bag<br />to Syd, Eddie.
4097136 4099096 Shot...
4100848 4103016 No. I didn't.
4107146 4109106 Run! Go, go!
4110816 4112568 Oh, shit!
4126832 4128457 Holy shit.
4128458 4130585 - Dad. What are you doing here?<br />Oh, shit.
4130586 4131794 Where's Gabe?
4131795 4133045 You didn't bring him here,<br />did you?
4133046 4134755 - Calm down.
4134756 4136841 He's safe at home watching TV.
4136842 4138759 What?<br />How long has he been alone?
4138760 4140344 You left him with me!
4140345 4143473 Do I look like<br />"daddy day care center" to you?
4144266 4146143 - Huh?
4146977 4149937 - The fuck happened to you?<br />- A lot.
4149938 4152523 - Did you get the coke?<br />- A little.
4152524 4154609 The bear ate most of it.
4154610 4156652 - What?<br />- The bear.
4156653 4158613 It fucking did cocaine.
4158614 4160114 A fucking...
4160115 4162450 A bear did cocaine, dad!
4162451 4163492 Fuck this!
4163493 4166621 Seriously,<br />fuck this entire journey.
4166622 4168539 Eddie, Eddie, just calm down.
4168540 4171542 Look at me. Look at me.
4171543 4173336 I'm on the hook here.
4173337 4178174 A lot of cocaine was lost<br />under my eye.
4178175 4180051 And the people that I deal with,
4180052 4182553 they don't care how,<br />just that it was.
4182554 4184472 And look at me.
4184473 4188017 They're gonna come after me,<br />my family
4188018 4191520 if I don't get them<br />every penny's worth.
4191521 4193439 You hear what I'm saying?
4193440 4196400 It's you and Gabe.
4196401 4198362 You understand?
4200280 4202783 We don't have a choice.
4204534 4207161 There's a bag<br />with the cop and the bear
4207162 4209289 over at the pavilion structure.
4211291 4212542 Come on.
4215796 4217714 Come on, son. Come on.
4225055 4227223 Who's there?
4227224 4229225 Easy.<br />Stay away.
4229226 4230851 Where's the duffel?
4230852 4232561 I gave it to the bear.
4232562 4234563 You gave it to the bear?
4234564 4236692 Yeah. The bear.
4237693 4239236 It loves coke.
4240153 4242113 Wh-which way did it go?
4242114 4244073 I'm not fucking around here.
4244074 4246575 Syd white.
4246576 4249120 Man, I've been following you<br />for years.
4249121 4250914 They all have.
4255752 4258421 Reba.
4258422 4261007 Oh, I always knew<br />you were my girl.
4261008 4262258 I got you now.
4262259 4264260 Be careful<br />when you cuff these guys.
4264261 4265846 They're kind of shifty.
4270934 4272685 What...
4272686 4274271 What are you doing?
4277024 4280151 - I'm sorry, Bob.<br />- I'm sorry, Bob.
4280152 4282028 You shot him?
4282029 4283154 I told you not to hurt him.
4283155 4284905 I don't work for you.
4284906 4286532 The department trusted you.
4286533 4290244 The state of Tennessee<br />trusted you.
4290245 4294957 The United States of America,<br />it trusted you.
4294958 4296625 I know.
4296626 4299086 - I trusted you with rosette.<br />- I know.
4299087 4301005 Who's rosette?
4301006 4302256 The dog in my car.
4302257 4303799 You left a dog in the car?
4303800 4305760 You left my son in Saint Louis.
4305761 4307637 How is she?
4315312 4317355 She being a good girl?
4317356 4319940 Yeah. She's such a good girl.
4319941 4321317 E-Enough.
4321318 4323444 Tell me which way the bear went,
4323445 4326072 or I'm gonna kill the dog<br />when I come down mountain.
4326073 4328574 Oh, no, no, please,<br />d-don't-don't do that.
4328575 4330868 I'd vote for not<br />killing the dog today,
4330869 4332745 but that's just me.
4332746 4334497 Well, what do you guys say?
4334498 4336833 What's so funny?
4339044 4341337 Apex predator,
4341338 4344674 high on cocaine,<br />and you're going towards it.
4351139 4353265 Dead north, man.
4353266 4355226 - Yes, we will.
4355227 4358062 Dead... dead north.
4358063 4359731 Let's go.
4401231 4403858 The devil bear is in there.
4403859 4406402 You can't go in there.
4406403 4408904 Do you have kids?
4408905 4410406 We would have.
4410407 4412158 I have to go find mine.
4412159 4414411 And his name would be Texas.
4415245 4416913 - Do you have a flashlight?<br />- Yeah.
4422586 4423670 Here.
4424546 4425921 Thank you.
4425922 4428591 Bye, lady and little man.
4428592 4430385 Bye, you both.
4432053 4434096 Okay.
4434097 4436349 Wait. What about me?
4457078 4459456 Watch where you step.
4461208 4463668 - I got you. Stay close.
4466004 4468298 What's that?
4473011 4474386 Don't move.
4474387 4476014 Stay still, Henry.
4482270 4484188 They look like polar bears.
4484189 4485564 Henry?
4485565 4486525 Dee Dee?
4486526 4487983 Dee Dee?<br />- Mama!
4487984 4489777 Don't move. I'm gonna get you<br />out of here, okay?
4489778 4491987 No, no. Them, they're...<br />They're harmless. -Dee Dee!
4491988 4494449 - Mama, I just...<br />- Baby!
4495242 4496408 Dee Dee, you're okay.
4496409 4497743 Are you hurt?
4497744 4499161 - It's just my leg.<br />- Your leg?
4499162 4500579 That looks really deep.
4500580 4502831 Here. Don't touch it.<br />- Ow! Ow! Henry!
4502832 4504291 Let's keep you warm.
4504292 4505834 Oh, my gosh.<br />You found my sweater.
4505835 4507127 You smart girl.
4507128 4508837 - You left us clues.<br />- Yeah.
4508838 4510214 We found you.
4510215 4511715 Put that on.
4511716 4514718 - Mom, I'm so sorry.<br />- Oh, I love you so much.
4514719 4516220 Oh, my god.
4516221 4517680 Mom, i'm-I'm so sorry.
4517681 4518931 - I'm sorry. I just...<br />- It's okay.
4518932 4519974 Henry told me everything.
4519975 4521517 Everything?
4521518 4522726 You mean that<br />you guys did drugs?
4522727 4524395 - You told her?<br />No.
4524396 4526355 I had a suspicion,<br />and you just confirmed it.
4526356 4528649 I'm just so glad I found you<br />and you're okay.
4528650 4532570 - Um, what was that?
4532571 4534656 Cocaine bear's back.
4535448 4537283 - Can you walk?<br />- Uh, a little.
4537284 4538784 Come on. Let's go, Henry.
4538785 4540077 Go that way.
4540078 4541329 Go ahead.
4543039 4545165 It's okay. Come on.
4545166 4547252 Look. It's a way out.
4550422 4552966 It's the falls.<br />Oh, wow.
4562517 4564977 Henry, stay away from the ledge!
4564978 4566938 Oh, god.
4615487 4617822 This is it.
4621117 4622743 Syd, let's cut our losses.
4622744 4625329 All right? Let's just deal<br />with the fallout.
4625330 4628208 You saw what that bear did<br />to that hiker.
4631670 4633713 What is that?
4635256 4636757 - Oh, fuck!
4636758 4639010 What the fuck? What the fuck?
4641179 4643014 Come on.
4648478 4650062 Eddie.
4650063 4652148 Take this.
4656945 4658822 Fuck.
4664911 4666913 Thank you.
4675588 4678465 Goddamn bear.
4678466 4680051 Eddie, put the rest in the bag.
4689519 4691353 You got what you wanted?
4691354 4692689 Let's go.
4695859 4699069 There's-there's a lot more<br />out there.
4699070 4702031 We got to keep looking, understand?
4704367 4706034 We're not whole yet.
4706035 4707996 I'm leaving, Syd.
4712083 4713543 Go.
4738067 4740069 Give me the bag.
4741529 4743864 When did you all get so soft?
4743865 4746993 All got sand in your pussies.
4749788 4752498 Mom! How are we gonna<br />get out of here?
4752499 4754541 It's a dead end. What do we do?
4754542 4756252 Stay away from the bears.
4759380 4761590 This way.
4761591 4763342 Come on. There's an opening.
4763343 4765427 Henry, come here.
4765428 4767889 Dee Dee, get in here.<br />Someone's coming.
4769557 4771643 He has a gun.

4787951 4790953 Syd, there's kids here.<br />Let's just go.
4790954 4793205 No, I'm not leaving<br />without that cocaine!
4793206 4796625 So somebody better bring it down<br />or somebody else is gonna die.
4796626 4798169 You understand?
4800630 4802005 Go.
4802006 4803967 Come on. Help him out!<br />- Yeah, yeah.

5149061 5151104 How'd you guess?
5151105 5153815 You're so fucking obvious.
5153816 5155775 I just didn't want to guess it
5155776 5157653 to have you crying on me<br />all day.
5167330 5169456 She's a nurse!
5169457 5171166 He-he got grazed by a bullet.
5171167 5172500 He's in shock.
5172501 5174212 Put pressure on him.
5232228 5234521 I've called backup.
5234522 5237066 Her name's rosette.<br />She doesn't like fetch.
5237858 5240026 You should get going.
5240027 5242238 Take care of yourself.
5247285 5250538 Hi. Hi.
5251831 5253582 Rosette.
5264844 5266261 Whose dog is this?
5266262 5267846 I think it's mine.
5267847 5269597 Mine and Gabe's.
5269598 5270932 Is it on cocaine?
5270933 5272852 No.
5274270 5276439 That's a good dog.
5278607 5280817 So we just grab Gabe<br />and go, right?
5280818 5282320 Yeah.
5286032 5287699 I knew you'd be okay.
5287700 5290118 You're the toughest person<br />I know.
5290119 5293079 I think you get that<br />from your mom.
5293080 5294456 I think you're right.
5294457 5296624 Thanks for coming to get me.
5296625 5298877 I'm your mom. I love you.
5298878 5301546 You, too, Henry.
5301547 5304049 Hey, I'm sorry I pushed ray<br />on you too soon.
5304050 5306802 No. You deserve to be happy.
5308054 5309679 Henry, let's walk over here.
5309680 5312057 - Stay away from that. Come on.<br />I want to look.
5312058 5313475 I also don't want to look.
5313476 5315185 Ugh.<br />Don't look.
5315186 5317479 - Let's just cruise on by.
5317480 5320065 Oh, here come the po-po.
5320066 5321441 Hey, mom.
5321442 5323693 I want to go to Nashville<br />with you and ray.
5323694 5326780 Maybe we can go after<br />me and Henry get out of rehab.
5326781 5328156 Rehab?
5328157 5329866 We're cokeheads now.
5329867 5331326 You know?
5331327 5332869 We got the bite,<br />and we're about that life,
5332870 5334287 - Mrs. Mckinndry.<br />Mm-hmm.
5334288 5336624 Yeah, you're<br />too grounded for rehab.
5352348 5353848 Rodney, are you getting it?
5353849 5355892 I swear to god, Carol.
5355893 5357477 Well, then zoom in.
5357478 5359688 - Is the red light on?<br />- No, I got it.
5360898 5362399 Oh, they're so cute.
5362400 5363983 Oh, this is gonna be good.
5363984 5365193 Wait.
5365194 5366861 Why are they looking<br />at us like that?
5366862 5368613 Oh.
