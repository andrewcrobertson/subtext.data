64664 66723 Yeah!
135101 137763 You know<br />the first thing I thought
137904 139668 when I saw you?
140907 144502 I thought, I want to make<br />a child with that person.
146746 149147 What if it's a her?
149249 150978 What would you call her?
152318 154252 Ragni, maybe.
154354 155788 Sorry?
155922 157583 Ragni.
157690 161183 Let me think about<br />that for a second.
161294 162819 - Ragni.<br />- You hate it.
163429 165363 - Boy's name?<br />- Texas.
166766 168291 You kidding me?
168368 170632 - Texas is, like, a state, you know?<br />- I know.
172272 173933 There's about<br />three or four hours
174007 174974 till we reach the peak.
175108 176166 Ah, great.
183383 185852 Sweetie, can I just say<br />one last thing?
185985 188545 Then, I swear,<br />no more wedding talk.
188688 191157 - Of course.<br />- It's about the band.
191291 193658 But that is the one thing<br />you said I could handle myself,
193793 196125 and I've already made<br />my decision, Elsa.
196229 198129 Yeah, it's just that<br />I don't want
198231 200131 to use your brother's band.
200233 201564 - Why not?<br />- Honey...
201701 203191 He's super, super good.
203336 205134 - He works super hard.<br />- Yeah.
205238 207297 And he even takes<br />vocal lessons now.
207373 208340 Yeah, I know this.
208408 211309 I know this. It's just that,<br />well, Eric is no good.
211411 214813 I mean, he's, well,<br />terrible, actually.
214914 217246 His singing is like shit.
220887 223413 Hey. I mean,<br />he has a nice b...
223556 224717 Olaf!
226192 228058 Olaf, I didn't mean to...<br />Oh, God.
228194 229559 Wait for me.
229696 231221 Why are you so sensitive?
237270 239170 Told you I could<br />get us here.
246079 247877 It's beautiful.
248014 249914 Thank you.<br />I love you.
262128 263357 Elsa.
263796 266458 - Look. Look.<br />- What is it?
267567 268932 Look.
271804 273898 Quick, the camera.<br />Get the camera.
274040 276941 Oh, my, I've always wanted<br />to see a bear in real life.
277076 279545 First, humpbacks in Iceland,<br />and now this.
279646 281876 We have such good luck<br />in nature.
291291 292952 What do you see?
295928 298329 It's demented or something.
298631 299564 What?
303503 305062 Can I get the camera?<br />Give me the camera.
305171 306798 Demented?
307240 308765 I think<br />we should leave it.
308908 310637 It's something wrong<br />with it. Come on.
310777 311767 Come on...
311844 314108 - Come on.<br />- It's so cute.
315682 318014 Oh, there's nothing<br />to be afraid of, Kristoffer.
318151 320347 I'm not afraid, Elsa.
321454 323855 Oh, sweetie, now,<br />of course not.
326993 327983 Oh, fuck.
330530 331520 Don't panic.
331664 332654 What do we do?
332765 334494 If it's black, fight back.
334634 336500 If it's brown, lay down.
336636 338104 But is it black<br />or is it brown?
338204 339501 I mean,<br />it looks brown to me.
339639 341266 We're in Appalachia.<br />It's black.
341374 342864 - We have to fight it.<br />- How do you know?
343009 344534 You're not a bear expert.
346179 347704 Whatever you do, don't...
347847 349713 - Run! Where are we going?<br />- Oh-oh, no. Oh-oh, no.
349816 351477 - I said don't run! Stop! Stop!<br />- Uphill. Uphill.
353519 355009 - Run!<br />- Where do we go?
355154 357555 - Run, Elsa! Run!<br />- Where do we go?
357690 359658 Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
359792 361692 Run!
361828 364024 He's coming! Come on!
364130 365325 No! It's following...
371971 373564 Olaf! No!
373706 374901 God!
385351 386512 - Help me!<br />- Come on! Come on!
386652 388416 Olaf!
412712 414180 This is drugs.
415715 417615 This is your brain on drugs.
418184 422212 It isn't glamorous<br />or cool or kid stuff.
422355 424551 The thrill can kill.
424690 429389 Smoking crack is like<br />putting a gun in your mouth...
431597 433622 and pulling the trigger.
436803 439966 Millions of dollars' worth of<br />cocaine dropped from the sky
440072 443303 early today onto a driveway<br />in Knoxville, Tennessee.
443409 444968 Kenley Jones reports tonight<br />it was found
445111 447307 on the body of a man<br />who fell to his death
447447 449313 when his parachute<br />failed to open.
451284 454083 The body of the heavily<br />armed parachutist was found
454220 456780 early this morning<br />by 85-year-old Fred Myers
456923 458789 and his neighbor,<br />Ralph Johnson.
458925 460791 And you could see that<br />his main chute didn't open,
460927 462895 so I guess the loafers<br />was too much for him.
462995 465726 Police found more than<br />70 pounds of cocaine
465832 468164 wrapped in<br />football-size packages
468267 470565 in a duffel bag<br />the chutist was carrying.
476943 480311 Emergency chute deployed,<br />but didn't help much, I suppose.
481180 483308 Any narcotics found<br />with the plane wreckage?
483416 484747 Nothing.
484851 486114 Here's the I.D.
487253 488914 I know who that is.
489021 492616 Full name,<br />Andrew C. Thornton II.
492692 494456 Man was out of his mind.
497196 499528 What's the "C" stand for?
499665 502657 You said full name, but<br />you didn't say his full name.
506772 508831 Thornton was one of Syd White's guys<br />out of Missouri.
508975 511945 He's a known drug trafficker<br />with ties to Colombia.
512044 514843 Part of the Bluegrass Conspiracy.
514981 518781 And there's more of this<br />out there.
518885 520819 They dumped it somewhere.
523856 525722 Hey, Reba,<br />you have a dog, right?
525825 526815 Had.
526959 529690 Border collie. Barry.
529829 531354 Sorry for your loss.
532064 533361 Border collie, huh?
534066 535329 That's a cool dog.
536202 537499 Did he play fetch and stuff?
537637 538695 He loved fetch.
540673 541640 What?
542174 543972 Nothing. I just...
544076 546170 That's just awesome.
566899 567923 Damn it, Gabe.
568034 569160 Hi, Daveed.
571170 573832 Mind if I order first?
573940 575704 This won't take long.
581581 584016 Damn, I just bought these.
589755 592349 Hey, how's Gabe doing,<br />anyway?
593092 594685 Did you hear about Thornton?
595695 596719 It's a tough way to go.
596862 599024 He only had 30 kilos on him.
599131 600724 Any idea where<br />we could find the rest?
602034 603263 Chattahoochee.
603402 604426 Georgia?
604537 606437 There's an area<br />called Blood Mountain.
606572 608267 When the plane's<br />going down,
608407 610273 the pilots know<br />where to drop our load.
610743 612040 And then we just go<br />and get it.
612545 615276 I don't need a bunch<br />of worried Colombians.
615414 617109 Now, I want you<br />to take Eddie with you.
617249 618580 Eddie's in mourning.
618718 620379 Joanie just died.
620486 621715 And he quit.
621821 623619 Joanie's the reason<br />why he quit.
623756 625281 She's not here anymore.
625424 627483 The sooner he moves on,<br />the better.
627627 629561 Syd, I just don't...
629662 630925 Stop.
630997 633898 He won't even come<br />to get his goddamn son.
634000 637129 I am sick and tired<br />of watching my kid's kid.
637269 639465 Grandpa Syd, watch.
640840 642501 Yeah, that's great.
645144 647511 Got to go.<br />Shift starts at 8:00.
649248 651512 Tomorrow's lunch is in the fridge,<br />and the chicken's...
654086 655850 Chicken's in the microwave.<br />Just hit start.
658190 659749 Thought you were off tonight.
660292 661657 We talked about this,<br />remember?
661761 663456 Me picking up<br />some extra shifts?
663529 664519 You said<br />you were okay with it.
664664 666792 I was okay with it<br />until I realized
666866 668459 why you want<br />those extra shifts.
668601 672367 So you could go and do overtime<br />with Ray the Pediatrician.
674140 676302 Gross, Dee Dee. Gross.
677877 680346 You know, he invited us<br />to go to Nashville
680479 682038 this weekend<br />to see his band play.
682548 684880 We were supposed to go paint<br />the waterfall this weekend.
685017 686678 I know,<br />but it's gonna be fun.
686819 688184 We're gonna make<br />a whole weekend out of it.
688320 690049 It's Nashville.
690856 692722 He's a good guy, Deirdra.
694293 695283 Just...
695394 696691 Give him a chance.
696829 698661 Please don't do that.
698998 700159 Do what?
701867 703562 You know what.
704837 706862 We'll paint the waterfall<br />another weekend, okay?
709075 711635 Close my door.
719151 721210 That's enough for today.
721721 723382 Wait, what?
724590 725921 Hey, Eddie.
727727 730162 They spelled<br />her name wrong, Daveed.
732565 734055 It says John.
734200 736430 - Says John.<br />- Yeah.
736569 738663 - Her name is fucking Joan.<br />- Look, we...
738771 740865 - We could get it fixed.<br />- No.
741006 742872 I got to wait a week<br />for it to heal first.
743008 745067 I got seven more days<br />of John.
745211 747077 The chutist<br />has been identified
747213 748840 as Andrew Thornton<br />of Paris, Kentucky.
749615 751242 - Wait, is that us?<br />- Hey.
751951 755012 Listen, Syd is worried<br />about you, all right?
755454 757513 Says you haven't seen Gabe<br />in weeks.
759625 762026 I'm so sad, man.
762128 764688 I'm so fucking sad.
764797 766060 Okay?
772772 775241 Can I get the...<br />the penne, please?
777209 779075 Does it come with chicken,<br />or is it just...
779211 780804 It's just plain.
792825 794384 I knew you'd be late.
794493 796587 It finally came in.<br />Check it out.
796729 798458 How many weeks' allowance<br />is that?
798597 800588 Like a thousand,<br />but worth it.
800666 802327 - Can I use the toilet?<br />- No.
802468 804664 My mom is gonna<br />be home soon.
804804 808297 And we got to go if we want<br />to get to the falls by lunch.
808774 810572 Why by lunch?
810676 812166 The light, Henry.
813479 815345 But I got to go pee.
815481 816846 Go outside.
816982 818780 Why do I skip school<br />with you?
818918 821148 You're bossier than<br />the teachers.
821787 822913 Now, the adoption people...
823022 825081 I'm not sure<br />who I talked to over there,
825191 827319 told me I was supposed to be<br />getting me a Lab.
827459 831089 A fun one...<br />a man's-best-friend type.
831197 832790 I don't know<br />if there was an error,
832932 835526 because the one I got<br />is just kind of...
835668 837329 - Bob?<br />- I don't know.
837469 838959 Just kind of fancy.
839104 841596 - Bob, Captain says it's time to go.<br />- Got it.
842208 843972 Hey, look, I'm gonna<br />have to call you back.
845511 846501 Hey, Reba.
847179 848840 You got plans for tonight?
850049 852848 Bob, you're a nice guy.
852985 855044 - I just don't...<br />- Mind looking after Rosette?
857189 858520 I have to go to Georgia
858657 859852 for the Thornton case,
859992 861482 and you said<br />you were good at dogs.
861627 863493 I said I had a dog.
863629 866189 You don't have jurisdiction<br />in Georgia.
866332 867822 A trucker overheard<br />a couple of guys
867967 869457 talking at a bar<br />last night.
870202 872227 - I'll tell you in the car.<br />- No, no, no.
872371 873964 Pretty sure<br />they're Syd's guys.
874073 876906 Oh, come on.<br />You got to be sort of good with them.
877042 879010 I only had her for a day.
879144 880543 Please?
880646 883206 I don't know if I could trust<br />anyone else around here.
885851 886909 Just go.
887052 888542 We'll be fine.
889922 890980 Thanks.
893425 895223 Can't believe<br />I left the backpack.
895361 897056 I can. I know the way.
897196 898857 School's gonna call, you know.
898998 900864 You know what?<br />Let 'em.
901000 902900 And your mom's<br />gonna be pissed.
903569 904832 So's your dad.
904937 906564 He doesn't care<br />if I play hooky.
907172 908367 For a girl who likes<br />to be left alone,
908507 909997 you do a lot of shit<br />for attention.
910109 911577 Look, I'm not<br />ditching for attention.
911710 913007 I just want to paint<br />the waterfall.
913112 914102 Admit it.
914213 916181 You want her to find out<br />and worry about you.
946779 948474 Jesus! Fuck!
949782 951147 Coral, it's Sari.
951283 952648 Is Dee Dee over there?
952785 953911 School just called.
954753 955811 No.
956155 958214 Yeah, well, can you just<br />put Elliot on?
959658 961387 Yes, well, his daughter<br />just ditched school,
961493 963621 so can you please<br />just put him on?
966165 968224 Every time I call,<br />he's in the bathroom.
968334 970132 What the hell<br />is wrong with him?
972271 973295 Never mind.
1017016 1018814 50 cents.
1026125 1027718 I'm not gonna see<br />that wrapper outside
1027860 1029726 - on the ground, now, am I?<br />- No, ma'am.
1029862 1032024 You one of those kids<br />caused me a bunch of shit?
1032164 1034189 - What?<br />- Empty your pockets.
1035000 1036559 Vest pocket. Come on.
1040539 1041836 Is that perfume?
1042307 1043638 That's none of<br />your business.
1043742 1046074 Well, it smells<br />really nice.
1046211 1048509 Yeah, well,<br />it's European.
1049748 1051375 Yeah, I'm expecting someone<br />in a minute.
1052084 1053245 Is it too much?
1053385 1054375 Not at all.
1054520 1055817 Smells expensive.
1055921 1058583 Well, it is.
1059425 1061154 You want a sucker?
1061260 1062352 Sure.
1063362 1064352 I like the green one.
1064496 1065725 This is a red one.
1066498 1068694 Yes, ma'am.
1070202 1072432 Oh, shit. He's here.
1082848 1084543 Am I in the right place?
1087286 1089254 Right.
1089354 1090788 Told you it was big.
1090923 1092413 Oh, it's big.
1093358 1094450 What's that smell?
1094593 1095958 It's European.
1098564 1100430 Someone been smoking?
1100566 1102193 He was.
1102301 1103359 - Can you believe it?<br />- What?
1103435 1105233 You know,<br />cigarettes kill people.
1105304 1106772 - Yeah, but...<br />- And animals.
1106905 1109897 Forest fires are the number one<br />cause of death for wildlife.
1110042 1111976 Yeah, and you should be<br />educating yourself
1112111 1114443 instead of endangering<br />the entire ecosystem.
1114546 1115877 Just get out of here.
1115981 1118416 Get out.
1119051 1120541 Unbelievable.
1122221 1123916 You got a dusty beaver here,<br />Ranger.
1124056 1125990 Yeah, well,<br />I'm working on that.
1148614 1149809 Hey, Henry!
1151283 1153980 It looks like the deer<br />on this sign are doing it!
1154119 1155484 Hold on.
1157322 1160292 Seriously, what the hell<br />are you even doing?
1160826 1162191 Marking our territory.
1162327 1164022 Don't shit out here!
1164630 1167031 I'm not shitting.
1170636 1173628 Hey. Did your mom pack<br />double lunch for school again?
1173772 1176104 My dad didn't have a chance<br />to make any.
1176675 1177665 Hey, Henry.
1187819 1189617 Check it out.
1193058 1194548 It's drugs, I think.
1194693 1196354 It's drugs?
1196495 1198554 Remember that guy<br />from assembly?
1198697 1201792 He showed us pictures of stuff<br />that looked just like this.
1201900 1203390 Yeah. The guy from Vietnam<br />with no legs.
1203535 1204730 No.
1205671 1207230 This is definitely cocaine.
1207372 1209204 Yeah. Of course.
1209308 1211970 I'm just not used to<br />seeing it like that.
1212578 1215912 You know, it's usually<br />more powdery on the streets.
1217182 1219082 When have you seen cocaine<br />on the streets?
1219218 1220310 When I do it.
1220419 1221409 Oh, yeah?
1221553 1222543 With who?
1222688 1224087 With Faulk.
1224523 1225547 After church.
1225691 1227523 Faulk does not<br />do cocaine after church.
1227659 1229058 Are you friends<br />with Faulk?
1229194 1230252 No. He's a pervert.
1230395 1231556 Then you wouldn't know.
1231897 1232887 Liar.
1232998 1235228 You're just mad<br />you're never invited.
1235367 1237267 I don't care<br />I'm not invited.
1237402 1239063 Sounds like you care.
1241039 1242097 Do some then.
1244376 1245741 What?
1245877 1247868 You've done it before.<br />You can do it again.
1248013 1251745 Well, we're exercising though.<br />Shooting and stuff.
1251883 1254682 I mean, I can't do cocaine<br />while shooting and exercising.
1254786 1256185 That wouldn't be good.
1256288 1257278 Fine.
1257689 1258884 Knife me.
1267699 1270430 Okay, so how do I do it?
1271570 1272731 You eat it.
1273772 1274739 How much?
1275240 1277402 Like a tablespoon's worth.
1290222 1293089 Son of a bitch!
1293792 1296056 Oh, what the hell?
1297162 1298891 Rookie.
1300966 1302456 You do it then.
1317849 1320580 Ah, shit!
1321119 1322644 What the hell?
1322788 1324813 This isn't as good<br />as the shit I normally do.
1331363 1333593 How much do you think<br />this stuff is worth?
1333699 1335633 Let's sell drugs together.
1335767 1338759 Yeah, we could sell them<br />on the street like you and Faulk.
1339471 1340700 There's more.
1346778 1348678 Something got into it.
1349681 1351171 A deer, maybe.
1351316 1354149 Could you imagine that?<br />Deer on cocaine?
1354219 1355516 It'd be like this.
1355620 1357816 Yeah, it'd be, like,<br />going into trees like, bang!
1357956 1359515 Bang!<br />Yep, and then it'd get stuck.
1359658 1361786 Yeah, and then<br />it'd be so sad.
1361860 1365057 Hey, Dee Dee. Do you think my dad<br />has ever done cocaine?
1365197 1367996 Your dad has definitely<br />done cocaine.
1370836 1372702 My throat's really runny.
1376408 1377637 Stop that.
1390222 1391986 Did it do the cocaine?
1392657 1395319 Don't move a muscle.
1401700 1403225 Listen to me.
1403368 1406338 You were supposed to grab Eddie,<br />not run your mouth.
1406438 1408429 - Now we have trouble. You understand?<br />- Got it.
1408573 1410701 I'll take care of it.
1410842 1412867 Gabe, knock that off.<br />Gabe.
1413011 1415036 - Grandpa Syd!<br />- Gabe, driving me nuts.
1415180 1416443 Little...
1416581 1417673 Fuck.
1446745 1448645 Joan loved this song.
1450615 1453915 She said he sang with the soul<br />of a thousand-year-old man.
1458156 1460056 Eddie, listen.
1460158 1463458 When Joanie died,
1464496 1466965 I'm sorry<br />I didn't, you know...
1468500 1469797 It's fine.
1469935 1471596 No, I could've did more.
1471736 1472760 It's fine.
1472904 1473837 I should've been there.
1473972 1475098 I didn't need you there.
1475173 1476663 I don't hang out<br />with drug dealers anymore.
1476808 1478173 It's against<br />my constitution.
1478643 1480111 I'm more than a drug dealer.
1480245 1482475 - No, you're not.<br />- Come on, Eddie.
1482614 1483809 We're friends, right?
1483949 1484916 No.
1485851 1486841 Fine.
1488186 1490177 I think he's happy<br />she's dead.
1490322 1491812 He's not happy she died.
1491957 1494153 Blamed her for me leaving<br />the family business,
1494292 1495760 if we can call it that.
1497095 1498187 Sometimes...
1499097 1501191 - I wonder if he did it to her.<br />- What?
1501333 1502858 No, Joanie died of cancer.
1503001 1504162 I know.
1504302 1506293 Maybe he gave her the cancer.
1506438 1507769 You can't give no one cancer.
1507873 1509432 Yes, you can. With stress.
1509541 1511305 Stop protecting him.
1511643 1513338 You know what?<br />Maybe I should turn this off.
1513478 1514468 No!
1523822 1525221 Okay.
1529294 1531820 Okay, so we start...
1531963 1533863 - Did you notice my nails?<br />- Those are beautiful.
1533999 1537060 - Thank you. We start...<br />- Excuse me. Is the ranger in?
1537202 1539296 I'm wearing the stuff.
1539404 1542135 Did either of you<br />see a girl,
1542240 1543901 13, come through here?<br />My daughter...
1544042 1545976 You lost your daughter<br />in the park.
1546077 1548546 Well, she came here on her own,<br />heading to the waterfall.
1548680 1551547 Yeah. Hikers under 16<br />must be accompanied by an adult.
1551683 1553378 Well, I didn't know<br />she was coming here.
1553518 1555179 You know, we get<br />a lot of runaways,
1555320 1558017 bad apples, youngsters<br />who aren't too happy
1558089 1559420 with the way<br />things are at home.
1559524 1560548 She's not a runaway.
1560659 1561854 She just came to paint the...
1561993 1563222 Can someone<br />just please point me
1563361 1564692 in the direction<br />of Blood Mountain?
1564829 1567264 This is Blood Mountain.
1567365 1568764 Sorry. I'm Peter.
1568867 1570335 This is Peter,<br />wildlife inspection rep.
1570402 1572496 We're about to<br />head up there ourselves.
1572604 1574003 Do you mind<br />if I tag along?
1574105 1575402 Now, Peter,<br />the wildlife inspection
1575540 1576905 is a very important process.
1577042 1578339 We wouldn't<br />want you distracted
1578443 1580775 by our little<br />damsel in distress here.
1580879 1581937 Nothing can distract me
1582080 1584447 from making sure<br />the entire biological community
1584583 1586608 is safe<br />for all our friends.
1586718 1587708 Friends?
1587786 1590016 He means animals.<br />I don't like that word.
1590121 1592283 He doesn't like<br />to call them animals.
1592424 1594119 Well, I won't be a burden.
1596595 1598120 I'll get my hat.
1599731 1600926 Okay.
1605370 1606963 Shoes okay for hiking?
1607105 1608869 Oh, yeah.<br />I think I'll be okay.
1608974 1610738 - I have on boots.<br />- Yep.
1610875 1612274 Come on, Eddie.
1612410 1613935 I'm done playing this game.
1614079 1615240 You wanted...
1615380 1616973 You were the one<br />who wanted to play this.
1617115 1618913 You still have<br />three more questions.
1619050 1620984 - Listen.<br />- What?
1622954 1624388 I'm tired of playing<br />this fucking game.
1624489 1626150 No, you're not.<br />You just don't want to lose.
1626291 1628760 I'm-a go in here and take a piss,<br />all right?
1633798 1636426 I didn't know<br />rangers carried guns.
1636568 1638969 Park rangers<br />are peace officers.
1639104 1641095 Which means<br />we can shoot people.
1641806 1643672 Forest is a dangerous place.
1643808 1645776 That gang of pubes<br />are dangerous.
1645910 1647241 Gang of pubes?
1647345 1648676 Teens. Delinquents.
1650982 1653110 They've been attacking hikers.
1653251 1654776 They hurt anyone?
1654919 1656683 They cut them with a knife.
1658189 1660317 Call themselves the Doochamps.
1660959 1662290 Watch your back.
1663461 1665987 Pop-art punks<br />pop up out of nowhere.
1666131 1667496 Out of nowhere.
1681946 1683141 Fuck is this?
1685316 1687216 He's afraid, buds.
1687352 1688945 Empty your pockets.
1689054 1690488 No.
1690622 1692954 Empty your pockets, please.
1695627 1697391 Since you asked so nicely.
1699798 1701391 You think this is a joke?
1702467 1703525 I do.
1703968 1705231 Get him, buds.
1706004 1707631 I'm shaking a fucking knife, man.<br />Come on.
1707739 1709229 - Just stab him.<br />- Come on, man. It's a fucking knife!
1709374 1710899 Go on!
1715914 1717211 Come on, Rocky.<br />Come on, Rocky.
1717348 1718907 - Come on, Rocky.<br />- Banzai!
1721086 1723054 Give me<br />this fucking board!
1724989 1726650 You're going down, man!
1733565 1735329 Submit! Submit!
1735433 1736559 What the...
1739771 1741239 Hold this!
1741372 1743602 Fucking skateboard!
1756221 1757586 Oh, my.
1771603 1773537 The fuck is wrong<br />with y'all?!
1773638 1775128 Shit!
1776141 1777700 I love this road.
1777809 1779402 Ah, love it up there.
1779544 1781239 So, wait, where is it<br />that you wanted to go again?
1781379 1782710 What? The falls.
1782781 1784408 The Secret Falls.<br />Right, well, we can go up this way
1784549 1785880 - or take the loop.<br />- I love the loop.
1785984 1788419 - Well, you can see the top of the...<br />- This is a more direct...
1789621 1791316 All right.<br />We're going this way.
1791456 1793117 Well, crap.
1793258 1795124 Told you she shouldn't<br />have come with us.
1795760 1797751 Just distracting you<br />completely.
1797829 1799319 She can hear you.
1799430 1801592 I wanted to get up<br />to see the sunset.
1803301 1805292 What's taking you so long?
1805436 1806767 What'd you do?
1817482 1819644 Please tell me<br />you found them like this.
1819784 1820751 They attacked me.
1820852 1821910 Are they dead?
1822020 1823181 Well, one might be.
1823288 1825154 The one that stabbed me<br />might be dead.
1828660 1830924 Jesus Chr... They're kids.
1831029 1833020 I loved<br />this fucking jersey, man.
1833164 1834632 Okay, they're fine.
1834766 1836097 Thank God.
1837268 1838360 No fucking way.
1840471 1841666 Daveed?
1849347 1850542 What happened?
1850682 1851649 Hey.
1851783 1852978 Wake up.
1853117 1854346 Where'd you find this?
1856054 1858489 Where is this energy<br />coming from, bud?
1858623 1860148 You tried to fucking kill me.
1860291 1862487 You got<br />a foul mouth there, bud.
1862627 1863992 I tell him that<br />all the time.
1864829 1866627 Where did you find this?
1866731 1868324 Up on the mountain.
1868466 1869399 Where's the rest of it?
1869968 1871527 I don't know.
1871669 1875128 Listen, I just took out<br />the three of you in 15 seconds.
1875240 1876833 What do you think<br />I'll do to just you
1876908 1878842 when you're already<br />on the floor?
1878977 1880206 Okay. Okay.
1881012 1883538 We stashed it<br />under a gazebo.
1883681 1885410 Going back for it<br />later tonight.
1886084 1887381 A gazebo?
1887518 1890544 It's a pavilion-type structure.
1890688 1892315 I know what the fuck<br />a gazebo is.
1892423 1893515 I didn't.
1895326 1897226 Are my buds dead?
1897362 1898761 - Show us where.<br />- Oh, God.
1898897 1900991 You know, I'm feeling<br />kind of tired.
1901099 1902396 I think I should rest.
1902533 1904399 Okay. Want a dirt nap?
1904535 1905900 Eddie, go get the gun.
1906037 1907061 It's in the glove.
1907171 1908605 I prefer we left guns<br />out of this.
1908740 1910538 Yeah. Same.
1910675 1913610 And I would prefer<br />not to be stabbed.
1913745 1916442 So, Eddie, please go get<br />the fucking gun.
1916581 1917673 Okay.
1919884 1920783 Okay.
1920919 1922011 All right, all right.
1922120 1923554 All right, I'm coming.
1924856 1925880 Relax.
1935233 1936792 It's getting real cold out.
1952116 1954141 Let's go.
1957221 1958655 So, where you guys from?
1958790 1960554 Shut up. Keep walking.
1960658 1963059 Gonna be a long hike<br />if we can't talk to each other.
1963161 1965061 It better<br />not be a long hike.
1965163 1966494 Friend's pretty serious,<br />ain't he?
1966631 1968065 Well, I don't think<br />he's too happy
1968166 1969656 after getting stabbed<br />in the shoulder.
1969801 1970893 Well, it wasn't me.
1971569 1973094 I don't blame him though.
1973237 1974466 Getting stabbed sucks.
1974605 1976004 Hey, shut the fuck up.
1992490 1994151 Yeah, Reba, it's Bob.
1994926 1996985 I was wondering<br />how Rosette is doing.
1997128 1999119 Realized I hadn't said<br />a proper goodbye.
2001099 2004592 I don't know if dogs think<br />about that sort of thing, but...
2005937 2007928 Anyway, I...
2010441 2012136 Thanks again for helping out.
2012276 2013368 Bye.
2016114 2017445 Look at this.
2017548 2018879 Oh, no.
2019017 2021213 Look at this mess.
2021352 2023218 People don't have<br />any respect.
2023354 2025220 This is gonna end up<br />in scat, this plastic.
2025356 2026619 I...<br />Let me pick that up.
2026724 2028886 - All right. Thank you, Ranger.<br />- Dee Dee!
2029027 2030654 That is sticking.<br />I got some oil in the car.
2030795 2031956 Dee Dee! Henry!
2032063 2033553 'Cause if that stays open,
2033698 2035325 - critters can get in there.<br />- Oh, yeah, critters.
2035466 2037457 What kind of critters?
2037568 2039036 - Squirrels?<br />- Squirrels could get in there.
2039170 2041229 - Chipmunks?<br />- Yeah, chipmunks get in there.
2041372 2042806 - Dee Dee!<br />- Skunks.
2042907 2044306 Raccoon, you know,<br />little burglar.
2044409 2046173 - That's right.<br />- Got his own little mask on.
2046310 2047209 - Yeah, with their cute little outfit.<br />- I think they're cute.
2047345 2048471 Skunks.
2048579 2049637 Skunks.
2049747 2050839 - Possums.<br />- Possums.
2050982 2052074 - Definitely possums.<br />- Possum.
2052216 2054184 Hey, possum.
2054318 2056377 Mrs. McKinndry!
2056487 2057579 Henry?
2057722 2059349 Here! Hello?
2059490 2060582 Henry?
2060725 2062090 Up here!
2064262 2066356 Hey.
2066497 2068329 Henry, what are you<br />doing up there?
2068399 2069389 No.
2069534 2071195 - No, that's not safe at all.<br />- No.
2071335 2073099 It's too high.<br />You got to come down.
2073237 2074227 Get down here.
2074338 2077239 Don't be mad,<br />but we skipped school.
2077375 2079036 - No shit, Henry.<br />- It's high.
2079177 2080440 But there was a bear.
2080578 2081875 A really terrible bear.
2082013 2083447 - A bear?<br />- Yeah, I know.
2083581 2085345 - It was fucked!<br />- Hey!
2085450 2087350 That's inappropriate.
2087452 2090581 Sorry for cussing,<br />but it attacked me and Dee Dee.
2090721 2092086 It attacked you?
2092223 2094123 - Henry, where is Dee Dee?<br />- No, no.
2094258 2096192 Bears are<br />very peaceful creatures.
2096294 2097853 You must have done something<br />to upset it.
2097962 2099726 - Yeah, did you feed it?<br />- What did you do?
2099864 2101855 Nothing!<br />Y'all need to hide!
2101966 2104628 I'm telling you,<br />it's not just any bear!
2104769 2106635 You have to<br />listen to me!
2106771 2108535 Henry, where is Dee Dee?
2108639 2110232 The monster took her.
2110374 2112968 Now, I'm not gonna<br />tell you again, little girl.
2113077 2115136 Get down here now.
2117648 2119742 I...
2120284 2121376 Dee Dee!
2142607 2143733 Peter!
2143841 2145605 - No!<br />- Peter!
2150014 2152073 Oh, no!
2152183 2154413 It let me go! He ran off!
2154485 2157147 - Henry, jump down.<br />- It's too high.
2157288 2158483 Is it gone?
2158623 2160113 Do you see it?
2168366 2169356 Yeah.
2169500 2171491 Why are you shooting at me?
2171636 2172762 Get your ass down!
2172870 2174269 This is your fault.
2174372 2175806 Right behind you. I saw it.
2177108 2178132 Stay down.
2187051 2188951 What?
2206671 2208036 Help me!
2209040 2210872 Help!
2215246 2217874 Ranger! Ranger!
2218015 2219380 Did it get you?
2219517 2221246 That asshole!
2221352 2223150 I'm gonna get him.
2223254 2224585 I'm gonna get that asshole.
2228092 2229355 I'll get help.
2229493 2230722 Where are you going?
2230861 2232158 God Almighty.
2232263 2234163 Hey. What...
2235866 2237061 Where is it?
2239003 2240437 Hey!
2243007 2244600 What should I do?
2244742 2246232 Motherfucker!
2246377 2247538 Come back! Help us!
2250014 2251846 Oh, fuck!
2257121 2258589 There's something wrong<br />with it.
2258723 2260020 Yeah, I told you there was.
2260124 2262286 Why is it<br />acting like this?
2262426 2264360 Did you feed it cocaine?
2264462 2266590 No. But you're safe.
2266731 2268529 Bears can't climb trees.
2268633 2269862 Of course they can!
2270401 2271869 Then why are you up here?
2297595 2300155 It's okay. It's okay.
2317615 2318810 Okay.
2335666 2336861 No.
2339470 2342132 Henry, climb. Henry, go.
2342273 2344537 Climb! Climb!<br />You got to get higher!
2344675 2346109 - Climb.<br />- Go, Henry!
2346210 2347439 Go!
2347545 2349445 - Henry, move!<br />- Go higher!
2352216 2353445 Go up!
2353551 2355315 Henry, go!
2355453 2357217 Oh, God.
2359290 2360815 Go, Henry! No!
2360958 2362016 No!
2362159 2364127 Oh, God. Henry!
2379143 2380907 Oh, God.
2383481 2384414 Oh, shit.
2388152 2390211 No, no, no, no!
2392757 2395385 Get off of me! No, no!
2395526 2397551 Get off! Get off of me!
2403901 2405835 Henry, jump! Jump down!
2405936 2407927 Move, Henry!
2414678 2416840 It's okay. It's okay.<br />You're doing great.
2416947 2419348 You're almost there.<br />Come on, baby.
2419450 2421441 Come on. Let's go.
2421585 2423519 Come on.
2442406 2444738 Go. Hide.<br />Come here. Come here.
2449480 2451278 That was so messed up.
2452450 2455044 That little man<br />was an expert on bears
2455152 2457746 but didn't know the bear<br />was the cocaine bear.
2457888 2459583 Wait. What did you say?
2459723 2461452 We found cocaine,<br />Mrs. McKinndry.
2461559 2462993 There was cocaine in the forest,<br />and the bear ate it
2463127 2465391 and then went crazy<br />on me and Dee Dee
2465496 2467658 and now on that guy<br />back there.
2467798 2469596 Did you hear him scream?
2469733 2471394 He's so dead.
2472570 2474504 I'd love to<br />not remember that.
2475306 2476501 But it kind of seems like
2476640 2479132 the thing that stays<br />with a man forever.
2480177 2483147 Henry, when the bear<br />took Dee Dee, was she...
2483280 2485146 Alive? Yeah.
2485282 2486841 It chased her that way.
2487852 2489820 We got to go. Let's go.
2493090 2494251 He get at you too?
2494358 2497020 - Fucking beast.<br />- Yeah, you can say that again.
2497161 2499493 - Call an ambulance.<br />- I already did.
2501999 2503489 Keep him awake.
2503634 2504999 Yeah, I've been trying.
2521352 2523514 You piles of shit!
2523654 2525952 - You're the Doochamps!<br />- Hey, that's not ours.
2526056 2527524 We found it.
2530494 2531962 It's not ours.
2533664 2535029 I'm a park ranger.
2535165 2537190 - I'm not dumb.<br />- I know.
2537334 2539735 They say I can't keep<br />my park safe,
2539837 2541464 that I'm unfit<br />for the big leagues.
2541572 2543336 I'd have been<br />at Yellowstone by now
2543474 2544498 if it weren't for you shits!
2544642 2545803 Buds.
2546577 2548306 There's someone outside.
2549079 2551639 It's him. Get to the door.<br />Get to the door.
2551749 2552910 Yeah.
2553050 2556850 Now, open it<br />when I count to three.
2557354 2558822 Wait, wait.<br />But you're gonna shoot him?
2558923 2560152 Hell yes,<br />I'm gonna shoot him!
2560257 2561747 He took a bite<br />out of my ass!
2562326 2564522 What the fuck is wrong<br />with this guy?
2565663 2567597 Now, open it when I say so.
2570935 2572198 Now.
2574371 2576362 That's a fucking bear.
2582413 2584245 What the fuck?
2592423 2593515 I didn't mean to.<br />I'm sorry.
2593624 2595422 - You're sorry?<br />- I'm sorry.
2595526 2597119 - Where'd the bear go?<br />- You killed him.
2597261 2598285 Where's the bear?
2598429 2600227 - I don't know!<br />- Close the door!
2600364 2604028 - Close the motherfucking door.<br />- Jesus Christ.
2604134 2605431 Close the door.
2607471 2610236 Oh, God. I'm sorry, bud.
2616280 2619045 Keep your mouth shut.<br />Check over there.
2647578 2649342 He's up there.
2649480 2650777 He's up there.
2681612 2684547 I got it. I got it.
2695125 2696524 Maybe the kid<br />can help you.
2696660 2698822 Look, I'm done<br />playing this game.
2698962 2700657 - What game?<br />- 20 questions.
2700798 2703199 Daveed's so fucking cold.<br />It's unbelievable.
2703333 2705631 - What did he ask so far?<br />- He just keeps guessing.
2705736 2707727 Like, is it a spider?
2707871 2709737 Is it an arrow?
2709873 2712001 What are you, new?
2713410 2715037 Hey, start broad,<br />then narrow it down.
2715179 2716476 Everybody knows that.
2716580 2718139 Look, are we close<br />to the gazebo?
2718248 2719841 Is that one of<br />your questions?
2719983 2721508 Oh, is it bigger<br />than a bread box?
2721652 2723086 No, no, no.<br />Daveed needs to ask.
2724822 2727052 Ask him if it's bigger<br />than a bread box.
2728258 2730727 Is it bigger<br />than a bread box?
2732096 2733222 Yes.
2733363 2734592 Yeah!
2734732 2736325 Is it Abraham Lincoln?
2736433 2738561 What? No.
2738702 2741831 Broad, then narrow<br />it down, man.
2741939 2743873 You have<br />one question left.
2799763 2802755 Dee Dee! Dee Dee!
2802900 2804299 You sure this is the way?
2804802 2806236 Pretty sure.
2811909 2813502 Dee Dee! It's okay.
2813644 2815134 It's Mama.
2820017 2821416 Thank God.
2821518 2823316 What the heck?
2823453 2825649 It's paint.<br />It's just red paint.
2825789 2828019 It looks a lot like blood.<br />How can you be sure?
2828158 2830024 I'm a nurse, Henry.
2830160 2831286 Good point.
2832930 2834193 Come on.
2839102 2840968 Oh, smart girl.
2843273 2845469 Henry, come on.<br />She left us a trail.
2845609 2848510 Mrs. McKinndry,<br />have you ever done cocaine?
2848645 2850044 What?
2850180 2852615 Why do you ask?
2852716 2854878 Just wondering if it has<br />long-term side effects,
2855018 2858283 for the bear, of course,<br />if it just did a little bit.
2858388 2861619 Well, it could create<br />a habit for the bear.
2861725 2864194 What if they never want<br />to do it again?
2864294 2866729 Oh, then it...<br />it should be fine.
2866864 2869629 But Mama Bear and Papa Bear<br />would be very angry
2869733 2871895 because drugs,<br />especially cocaine,
2872035 2874129 are very, very bad.
2874238 2875831 What if they would<br />never find out?
2875973 2877372 Oh, Henry.
2877507 2879635 We always find out.
2879743 2881472 Dee Dee!
2907104 2908401 Medic!
2908538 2909767 Just open it.
2909907 2911272 - Yeah, open it.<br />- You think?
2911408 2913433 Can you just push?<br />Harder.
2913577 2914772 - I'm doing it as hard as...<br />- Just let...
2914912 2916038 - All right. You go.<br />- Let me do it.
2916179 2917112 You go. Yeah.
2917247 2918339 Please, show me<br />how it's done.
2921351 2922750 Go ahead, Beth.<br />You're strong, right?
2922886 2924877 Oh, yes, I am.<br />Let me see.
2925022 2926922 What is that?
2927057 2928923 - See anything?<br />- Just, can you...
2929059 2930527 - Can you help? Can you help?<br />- Yeah.
2930627 2932186 What happened to feminism, huh?<br />Is that dead?
2932262 2933957 - Come on.<br />- Wait. Okay, wait, wait, wait.
2936733 2938223 Oh, fuck.
2938368 2939460 Come on.
2939603 2941264 God, I'm trying.
2941405 2942873 Come on, push.
2942973 2944270 I'm trying.
2944408 2946103 You said they called in<br />a concussion.
2948478 2949741 They did.
2954618 2955710 Jesus.
2955819 2957287 This guy's been shot.
2957421 2959116 Yeah. Obviously.
2961124 2962649 Holy shit.
2962793 2963885 It's the ranger.
2963994 2965291 Tom.
2965429 2967090 Come here.<br />She's got a gun.
2969166 2971100 Tom! Hello?
2973603 2976095 No, no. Put that down.<br />Put that down.
2976239 2977263 It's okay.
2977407 2979967 Did you shoot that guy?
2980110 2983080 B... B...
2983180 2984272 Buh?
2993323 2996418 B... B...
3008805 3010136 Beth?
3010273 3013004 It's okay.<br />It's okay. Calm.
3042239 3044037 Beth, we should go.
3045475 3046874 It's okay. It's okay.
3056019 3057009 Bear.
3058255 3059723 Bear.
3063093 3064754 Let's go.
3064895 3066693 Tom, get up!
3071501 3072991 Don't look back.<br />Don't look back.
3078708 3080676 Hang on. Push.
3085949 3087178 Oh, shit.
3087284 3089116 Sorry. Sorry.
3095692 3097057 Come on. Come on.
3097194 3098457 Anybody else surprised by
3098595 3099858 that rain this morning?<br />I know I was.
3099963 3101294 Leave him!
3119549 3121381 Our next story, the weather

3133296 3135731 Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
3135832 3138733 Jesus, Beth,<br />I wasn't even on yet.
3138835 3141133 What the fuck is wrong<br />with that bear?
3143406 3145306 What the hell<br />have you got a gun for?
3145442 3146807 Hey, move! Move!
3146943 3147910 Put that away!
3151581 3154107 Jesus Christ!<br />Shoot it! Shoot it!
3156019 3157350 - Oh, shit!<br />- Kill it!
3157487 3158579 Not the tree!
3158688 3160178 - The big fucking bear!<br />- Shut up!
3160323 3161813 Why is it chasing us?
3163293 3165318 Tom, try to shut<br />the fucking door!
3165462 3167760 Close the fucking door,<br />you dumbass!
3167864 3169332 Guys, you got to stop<br />yelling at me!
3172769 3174828 Oh, shit.
3177107 3179474 Beth, speed up!
3240270 3242602 I don't know<br />how to talk to him, you know.
3242739 3246698 Like, what do you say to<br />a kid who just lost his mommy?
3248011 3250912 My mom is the reason<br />I'm the man I am today.
3251414 3252575 And what a man you are.
3252716 3254411 Attacking innocent people<br />for no reason.
3254551 3255541 Can you not?
3255852 3257911 I'm sorry.<br />Just continue.
3258054 3259920 Well, when my daddy died,
3260056 3262388 my mama bought me<br />this pet lizard.
3262525 3264289 It was the coolest little thing.
3264427 3266521 It had all these<br />green scales on it.
3266630 3268792 She used to call it<br />a tiny dinosaur.
3268932 3270696 I thought<br />that was so awesome.
3271368 3273302 I was real bad<br />at connecting with people,
3273436 3275268 but I practiced<br />conversation starters
3275372 3276931 on that lizard every day.
3277073 3279872 And then that's how I met<br />Rocky and Joe.
3281478 3283037 That's my team, man.
3283146 3286116 We're planning on moving<br />to New York City together.
3287083 3290212 Those are my buds, man.
3290920 3292718 So I should<br />get Gabe a lizard?
3292822 3294984 Well, you know what?
3295659 3297821 Lizards are<br />good listeners, bud,
3299296 3300661 but people...
3301331 3303493 people are good at hearing.
3307904 3310965 That's the sweetest thing<br />I ever heard. Thank you.
3311107 3312802 - Can we...<br />- It's okay.
3312942 3314671 Y'all are hugging.
3314811 3316142 It's okay.
3320150 3321845 Where the fuck<br />is the gazebo?
3395692 3399185 Can I say something<br />without you getting angry with me?
3400663 3402722 I'm already<br />angry with you.
3406202 3407601 It's gone.
3409272 3410330 What the actual...
3410440 3411908 - No! Please, please!<br />- Daveed, stop.
3412041 3413372 No, no, no. The kid's<br />messing with us, Eddie.
3413510 3414739 No, no, no! I'm not!<br />I'm not! I'm not!
3414844 3416403 I promise.<br />I don't know where it went.
3416546 3417604 It's just gone.
3418014 3420073 Okay, well,<br />duffel bags don't have legs.
3420216 3422116 Since you're the only one<br />that knew where it was,
3422252 3424414 I'm-a give you<br />one more chance.
3424554 3426113 Where's the ba...
3426256 3429692 Put the gun down<br />and move away from the teenager.
3430794 3435356 Drop the weapon and step away<br />about five to ten paces.
3435465 3437797 All right, listen.<br />Just calm down, all right?

3446943 3448809 - You don't want to do this.<br />- Shut up!
3448945 3450276 I'm coming down there.
3472635 3473966 I'm just trying to...
3474103 3476071 find a safe spot to hop down.
3476172 3477606 How did you get up there?
3477674 3480166 Well, I jumped<br />from that tree over there, but...
3480310 3481800 I hurt my hip a little.
3481945 3483970 I can try to catch you<br />if you want.
3484080 3486412 No, no! You stay<br />right where you are!

3500330 3502992 Oh, yeah? I shot<br />my own fucking fingers?
3503132 3504657 I told you not to move.
3504801 3507771 How'd he take<br />those two fingers off?
3507871 3509532 They're not even<br />next to each other.
3511541 3512975 Fuck you!
3514477 3515774 Come out of there!

3531294 3532523 Can you grab them for me?
3532662 3533823 Can I grab his fingers?
3533963 3535397 Okay. Get 'em. Get 'em.
3537133 3538498 Slow. Slow.
3541538 3542664 Easy.
3542805 3544068 God.
3546643 3547633 All right.
3547744 3549178 Now, you get back<br />on your belly.
3549812 3551007 I'll hold on to these.
3557253 3558687 Now, where you at?

3568331 3569492 Henry, look.
3570600 3572068 That's Dee Dee's sweater.
3572201 3574363 - Come on.<br />- So we're crossing?
3574504 3576097 We're on<br />the right track.
3576239 3577434 I can feel it.
3593923 3595254 Mama?
3597193 3598183 Fuck.

3605735 3607703 How long are you gonna<br />keep us like this?
3607971 3609530 Until that guy<br />in the gazebo
3609639 3611198 throws his weapon<br />into the woods.
3611307 3612934 Well, then<br />we'll be here forever.
3613042 3615773 Hasn't Syd already<br />messed your life up enough?
3615912 3618108 We don't need to die<br />because of this.
3618214 3620911 - Eddie, I got this.<br />- Do you?
3621084 3623746 I have your fingers<br />in my pocket.
3623886 3625285 You're all gonna<br />get arrested.
3625421 3627651 Drug sentences since Nixon<br />are fucked,
3627790 3630384 so get ready<br />for 10 to 15 years
3630493 3632461 of shitting<br />in front of your cellmate

3634497 3637057 Detective, Your Honor, sir,<br />I'm not with them.
3637133 3638464 I've never<br />even done coke.
3638601 3641571 I mean, maybe once.<br />Once... at a party once.
3641671 3643799 - I can't go to jail.<br />- You're not going to jail.
3643940 3645430 Just saying, I can't shit<br />in front of people.
3645575 3647100 I've never been able to shit<br />in front of people.
3647243 3649007 I like to shit in peace.
3654984 3656645 Nobody move.
3658354 3659617 It's a bear.
3659756 3661155 Yeah.
3661290 3663122 No, no.
3663259 3665353 I'm not falling<br />for none of your...
3688651 3690141 Oh, fuck.
3690286 3692152 Hey, y'all just stay still.<br />Don't move.
3692288 3693483 Just play dead.
3747844 3748868 Oh, fuck.
3758121 3759247 Oh, man. You fucked.
3759388 3760446 Eddie, can you breathe?
3760556 3762354 What the fuck?
3762458 3763926 I think that's a yes.
3764961 3766520 Can someone do something?
3766629 3768063 Maybe your boy<br />can do something.
3768631 3771794 Can you just, like...<br />move it?
3771934 3774198 Oh, of course.<br />Why didn't I think of that?
3778541 3780134 Dee Dee!
3780743 3783144 Henry, stay close.<br />I haven't seen paint in a while.
3785581 3787049 Oh, God.
3787950 3788974 Look.
3789118 3790313 Hello.
3792488 3795617 Is he okay?
3795758 3798455 Help me, please.
3798594 3800062 Does he have food?
3800563 3802930 Her name was Elsa,
3803065 3805124 and she was so beautiful.
3807470 3808938 Are you...<br />Are you hurt?
3809005 3810666 Were you attacked?
3811274 3812435 Devil bear.
3813476 3814602 My... I'm looking<br />for my daughter.
3814744 3815836 She was attacked<br />by the devil bear.
3815978 3816945 Have you seen her?
3817446 3818607 You have?
3818748 3820307 - Was she alive?<br />- Yes.
3820983 3822508 Please, can you just point<br />to where she went?
3822652 3824177 Please, can you show me?<br />I'm looking for her.
3824320 3825253 I haven't...
3825354 3826321 Henry!
3839335 3840632 I'll show you.
3840970 3842802 I'll show you. Come.
3848711 3850179 It's not moving.
3852515 3853676 I think it died.
3853816 3855784 It died on top of me?
3855885 3857046 Check its pulse.
3857186 3859553 Can you, like,<br />feel it breathing?
3859689 3861054 I'm not sure.
3864126 3865890 Hey, guy?
3866028 3867052 Detective.
3867196 3868357 Can we call a truce
3868497 3870124 so I can see<br />if the bear is dead?
3870399 3871389 Yeah.
3876005 3877029 Fuck.
3881878 3883073 You okay?
3883813 3885008 What do you think?
3903366 3905232 Still breathing.
3905368 3906529 We should go.
3907436 3909871 He'll probably be all right.
3910006 3911940 What the hell, man?
3912074 3913405 He's gonna<br />wake up eventually.
3913542 3915271 Well, that's exactly<br />what I'm afraid of.
3915411 3916572 She.
3916712 3917702 What?
3918180 3919773 The bear is a girl.
3919916 3921509 Oh, yeah.<br />How do you know that?
3921617 3924416 Because its vagina<br />is on my ear.
3926622 3928249 Oh, shit.<br />She's moving.
3928391 3929756 She's awake.
3930426 3932019 - Oh, shit.<br />- Well, stay back. Stay back.
3932762 3934594 Okay.
3939602 3940694 Chill out.<br />Just chill out!
3940803 3942635 Homes, hey, hey.
3942772 3944365 Stay back.
3948577 3950067 What the hell?
3950212 3952613 Okay. Okay.
3955718 3957618 No, no, no, no.<br />Don't eat that. Don't eat that.
3958821 3960653 I will be goddamned.
3960790 3962258 Should we shoot her?
3962391 3965588 No. Let's see what kind<br />of effect that has on it.
3967396 3969455 What the fuck?
3982411 3984903 No, no, no, no, no, no!
3985014 3986778 - Eddie!<br />- Daveed, help.
3986916 3989317 What is this?
3989452 3990476 No, no.
3990586 3992577 - Okay, I have...<br />- What is it doing?
3992688 3994247 I don't like this.
3994357 3995483 Please stop.
3995591 3997855 - Just go limp! Slide down!<br />- I'm limp already.
3999962 4001828 - Shoot the bear! Shoot her!<br />- Don't shoot!
4001964 4004023 No, no. Don't shoot.<br />Don't shoot.
4004166 4005190 Eddie, you got to<br />fight back, all right?
4005334 4006301 It's playing with you.
4006435 4007698 I'd stay still<br />if I were you.
4007837 4009965 Bud, just tap out, bud.<br />Bud, tap out!
4010106 4012165 Eddie, please don't die<br />like this. Eddie, please.
4012308 4013537 Daveed!
4013676 4015508 All we've been through!<br />Come on!
4015611 4016669 Come on, help him!
4016812 4018712 Get lower.<br />You're not listening!
4018848 4021146 Eddie.
4021283 4022842 Oh, my God.<br />He's gonna die.
4025187 4026313 No!
4026455 4027650 Hey, girl.
4037199 4038462 There you go, girl.
4039869 4041030 There you go.
4042972 4044303 There you go.
4044874 4047571 It's like cocaine Christmas.
4063592 4064650 Go!
4064760 4067229 Don't have to tell me twice.
4070332 4071322 Come on!
4071434 4072424 Daveed!
4072568 4074229 That bag's<br />worth $14 million.
4074370 4077203 We had a truce, and a truce<br />is on God where I'm from.
4077907 4080706 Can't you see I'm trying<br />to help you, kid? Go!
4080843 4082607 I need that bag.
4082745 4084713 Leave it, man.<br />Let's just go home.
4084847 4086941 We're taking that bag<br />to Syd, Eddie.
4097293 4098920 Shot...
4101030 4102896 No. I didn't.
4107436 4109063 Run! Go, go!
4110973 4112031 Oh, shit!
4127156 4128715 Holy shit.
4128824 4131225 - Dad. What are you doing here?<br />- Oh, shit.
4131293 4133159 Where's Gabe?<br />You didn't bring him here, did you?
4133295 4134763 Calm down.
4134897 4136922 He's safe at home<br />watching TV.
4137066 4138761 What? How long<br />has he been alone?
4138901 4140494 You left him with me!
4140636 4143298 Do I look like<br />daddy day care center to you?
4147243 4149507 - The fuck happened to you?<br />- A lot.
4150112 4152479 - Did you get the coke?<br />- A little.
4152615 4154606 The bear ate most of it.
4154750 4156616 - What?<br />- The bear.
4156752 4158584 It fucking did cocaine.
4158687 4160177 A fucking...
4160322 4162313 A bear did cocaine, Dad!
4162458 4163653 Fuck this!
4163792 4166591 Seriously,<br />fuck this entire journey.
4166695 4168493 Eddie, Eddie,<br />just calm down.
4168631 4171100 Look at me. Look at me.
4171634 4173534 I'm on the hook here.
4173669 4178300 A lot of cocaine was lost<br />under my eye.
4178440 4180135 And the people<br />that I deal with,
4180276 4182506 they don't care how,<br />just that it was.
4183145 4184635 And look at me.
4184780 4188045 They're gonna come<br />after me, my family
4188184 4190983 if I don't get them<br />every penny's worth.
4191954 4193353 You hear what I'm saying?
4193856 4195290 It's you and Gabe.
4196692 4198126 You understand?
4200529 4202019 We don't have a choice.
4205301 4207668 There's a bag<br />with the cop and the bear
4207736 4209170 over at<br />the pavilion structure.
4211540 4212530 Come on.
4215911 4217379 Come on, son. Come on.
4225254 4226517 Who's there?
4227423 4229323 - Easy.<br />- Stay away.
4229425 4230859 Where's the duffel?
4230993 4232518 I gave it to the bear.
4232661 4234527 You gave it to the bear?
4234663 4236654 Yeah. The bear.
4237733 4239064 It loves coke.
4240369 4242167 Which way did it go?
4242271 4244171 I'm not<br />fucking around here.
4244273 4245832 Syd White.
4247209 4249200 Man, I've been<br />following you for years.
4249345 4250938 They all have.
4255851 4258548 Reba.
4258687 4261054 Oh, I always knew<br />you were my girl.
4261190 4262351 I got you now.
4262458 4264722 Be careful<br />when you cuff these guys.
4264793 4265885 They're kind of shifty.
4270566 4271692 What...
4273135 4274125 What are you doing?
4277206 4280232 - I'm sorry, Bob.<br />- I'm sorry, Bob.
4280376 4282037 You shot him?
4282144 4283236 I told you not to hurt him.
4283379 4284904 I don't work for you.
4285047 4286708 The department trusted you.
4287383 4289818 The state of Tennessee<br />trusted you.
4290486 4294980 The United States of America,<br />it trusted you.
4295658 4296819 I know.
4296959 4299121 - I trusted you with Rosette.<br />- I know.
4300062 4301052 Who's Rosette?
4301163 4302324 The dog in my car.
4302464 4303761 You left a dog in the car?
4303899 4305731 You left my son<br />in Saint Louis.
4305834 4307302 How is she?
4315577 4317511 She being a good girl?
4317646 4319978 Yeah.<br />She's such a good girl.
4320115 4321412 Enough.
4321517 4323576 Tell me which way<br />the bear went,
4323686 4326155 or I'm gonna kill the dog<br />when I come down mountain.
4326288 4328757 Oh, no, no, please,<br />don't do that.
4328857 4330848 I'd vote for not<br />killing the dog today,
4330993 4332688 but that's just me.
4332828 4334626 Well, what do you guys say?
4334763 4336754 What's so funny?
4339168 4341432 Apex predator,
4341537 4344632 high on cocaine,<br />and you're going towards it.
4351647 4353376 Dead north, man.
4353515 4355313 Yes, we will.
4355451 4358045 Dead... Dead north.
4358654 4359678 Let's go.
4401430 4403831 The devil bear is in there.
4403932 4406492 You can't go in there.
4407269 4408862 Do you have kids?
4409004 4410529 We would have.
4410672 4412197 I have to go find mine.
4412341 4414366 And his name would be Texas.
4415444 4416934 - Do you have a flashlight?<br />- Yeah.
4422618 4423676 Here.
4424887 4425877 Thank you.
4426021 4428456 Bye, lady and little man.
4428590 4429853 Bye, you both.
4432194 4433286 Okay.
4434229 4436254 Wait.<br />What about me?
4457619 4459212 Watch where you step.
4461390 4463654 I got you. Stay close.
4466562 4467586 What's that?
4473135 4474466 Don't move.
4474603 4476002 Stay still, Henry.
4482444 4484242 They look like<br />polar bears.
4484346 4486644 - Henry?<br />- Dee Dee?
4486782 4487977 - Dee Dee?<br />- Mama!
4488083 4489573 Don't move. I'm gonna get you<br />out of here, okay?
4489651 4491949 - No, no. Them, they're harmless.<br />- Dee Dee!
4492020 4493419 - Mama, I just...<br />- Baby!
4495457 4496515 Dee Dee, you're okay.
4496658 4497921 Are you hurt?
4498026 4499152 - It's just my leg.<br />- Your leg?
4499294 4500693 That locks really deep.
4500829 4502763 - Here. Don't touch it.<br />- Henry!
4502865 4504333 Let's keep you warm.
4504466 4505763 Oh, my gosh.<br />You found my sweater.
4506168 4507158 You smart girl.
4507302 4508792 - You left us clues.<br />- Yeah.
4508937 4510268 We found you.
4510372 4511840 Put that on.
4511974 4514636 - Mom, I'm so sorry.<br />- Oh, I love you so much.
4515277 4516267 Oh, my God.
4516378 4517846 Mom, I'm so sorry.
4517980 4519948 - I'm sorry. I just...<br />- It's okay. Henry told me everything.
4520616 4521606 Everything?
4521717 4522878 You mean that<br />you guys did drugs?
4523018 4524508 - You told her?<br />- No.
4524620 4526452 I had a suspicion,<br />and you just confirmed it.
4526522 4528820 I'm just so glad I found you<br />and you're okay.
4528957 4532689 What was that?
4533228 4534559 Cocaine bear's back.
4535697 4537290 - Can you walk?<br />- A little.
4537399 4538696 Come on.<br />Let's go, Henry.
4539368 4540858 Go that way.<br />Go ahead.
4543171 4545196 It's okay. Come on.
4545340 4546967 Look.<br />It's a way out.
4550579 4553014 It's the falls.
4562724 4564886 Henry, stay away<br />from the ledge!
4565027 4566392 Oh, God.
4616111 4617374 This is it.
4620816 4622545 Syd, let's cut our losses.
4623051 4625418 All right?<br />Let's just deal with the fallout.
4625954 4627945 You saw what that bear did<br />to that hiker.
4632427 4633656 What is that?
4635430 4636898 Oh, fuck!

5232427 5233690 I've called backup.
5234829 5236888 Her name's Rosette.<br />She doesn't like fetch.
5237999 5239194 You should get going.

5473234 5474292 Oh, my God.
