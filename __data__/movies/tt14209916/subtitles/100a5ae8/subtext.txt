60920 61920 Yeah!
127160 130800 You know the first thing I thought<br />when I saw you?
132600 136320 I thought, "I want to make<br />a child with that person."
138200 139880 What if it's a her?
140480 141560 What would you call her?
143600 145200 Ragni, maybe.
145480 146480 Sorry?
146800 147840 Ragni.
149600 151200 Let me think about that for a second.
152040 153040 - Ragni.<br />- You hate it.
154120 155920 - Boy's name?<br />- Texas.
157680 158680 You kidding me?
158880 160880 - Texas is, like, a state, you know?<br />- I know.
162560 165240 There's about three or four hours<br />till we reach the peak.
165320 166320 Ah, great.
173800 175680 Sweetie, can I just say<br />one last thing?
175760 178240 Then, I swear, no more wedding talk.
178320 179320 Of course.
179520 180640 It's about the band.
181080 183176 But that is the one thing<br />you said I could handle myself
183200 185000 and I've already made<br />my decision, Elsa.
185680 188760 Yeah, it's just that I don't want<br />to use your brother's band.
189600 190800 - Why not?<br />- Honey...
190960 192240 He's super, super good.
192640 194360 - He works super hard.<br />- Yeah.
194440 195536 And... and he... he even takes
195560 196896 - vocal lessons now.<br />- Yeah, I know this.
196920 199760 I know this. It's just that,<br />well, Eric is no good.
200000 203400 I mean, he's, well,<br />terrible, actually.
203480 205000 His singing is like shit.
209360 210400 Hey.
210600 211640 I mean, he has a nice b...
211920 212920 Olaf!
214280 216120 Olaf, I didn't mean to...<br />Oh, God.
216480 218920 Wait for me.<br />Why are you so sensitive?
224960 226520 Told you I could get us here.
233480 234680 It's beautiful.
235120 236640 Thank you. I love you.
249040 250040 Elsa.
250320 251520 - Look.<br />- What is it?
252040 253040 Look.
253840 254920 Look.
257880 259920 Quick, the camera. Get the camera.
260200 263160 Oh, my, I've always wanted<br />to see a bear in real life.
263240 265480 First, humpbacks in Iceland,<br />and now this.
265560 267560 We have such good luck in nature.
277320 278320 What do you see?
281760 283440 It's demented or something.
283800 284800 What?
288320 289376 - Can I get the camera?<br />- Yeah.
289400 290400 Give me the camera.
290480 291520 Demented?
292040 293520 I... I think we should leave it.
293600 295376 It's... it's something wrong<br />with it. Come on.
295400 296400 Come on.
296640 298520 - Come on.<br />- It's so cute.
300040 302400 Oh, there's nothing<br />to be afraid of, Kristoffer.
302560 304560 I'm not afraid, Elsa.
305640 307680 Oh, sweetie, now, of course not.
310920 311960 Oh, fuck.
314640 316120 - Don't panic.<br />- What do we do?
316200 319880 "If it's black, fight back.<br />If it's brown, lay down."
320360 321576 But is it black or is it brown?
321600 323456 - I mean, it looks brown to me.<br />- We're in Appalachia.
323480 324560 It's black.
324880 326336 - We have to fight it.<br />- How do you know?
326360 327680 You're not a bear expert.
329160 330920 Whatever you do, don't...
331000 332720 - Run! Where are we going?<br />- Oh, no...
332800 334520 - I said don't run! Stop...!<br />- Uphill...
336160 337640 - Run!<br />- Where do we go?
337720 340080 - Run, Elsa! Run!<br />- Where do we go?
340160 342080 Oh, my God...!
342160 343200 Run!
344520 347360 - Run! He's coming! Come on!<br />- It's following us! No!
353640 355120 Olaf! No!
355840 356840 God!
361200 362200 Olaf!
365520 367800 - Olaf! Help me!<br />- Come on...!
367880 369080 Olaf!
393640 394680 This is drugs.
396120 397800 This is your brain on drugs.
398440 402280 It isn't glamorous<br />or cool or kid stuff.
402600 404480 The thrill can kill.
404880 408680 Smoking crack is like<br />putting a gun in your mouth...
411360 413280 and pulling the trigger.
416480 419280 Millions of dollars' worth of cocaine<br />dropped from the sky
419360 422320 early today onto a driveway<br />in Knoxville, Tennessee.
422560 423680 Kenley Jones reports tonight
423760 426480 it was found on the body<br />of a man who fell to his death
426560 428320 when his parachute failed to open.
429800 432200 The body of<br />the heavily armed parachutist
432280 435560 was found early this morning<br />by 85-year-old Fred Myers
435640 437320 and his neighbor, Ralph Johnson.
437400 439296 And you could see that<br />his main chute didn't open
439320 441200 so I guess the loafers<br />was too much for him.
441480 444120 Police found more than<br />70 pounds of cocaine
444200 446280 wrapped in football-size packages
446360 448520 in a duffel bag<br />the chutist was carrying.
454720 457840 Emergency chute deployed,<br />but didn't help much, I suppose.
458840 460960 Any narcotics found<br />with the plane wreckage?
461040 462080 Nothing.
462360 463480 Here's the ID.
464600 466000 I know who that is.
466440 469760 Full name: Andrew C. Thornton II.
469840 471600 Man was out of his mind.
474120 475480 What's the "C" stand for?
476800 479320 You said "full name",<br />but you didn't say his full name.
483000 485480 Thornton was one of<br />Syd White's guys out of Missouri.
485800 488440 He's a known drug trafficker<br />with ties to Colombia.
488720 491040 {\an5}Part of the Bluegrass Conspiracy.
491400 494480 And there's more of this out there.
495080 496560 They dumped it somewhere.
499880 501360 Hey, Reba, you have a dog, right?
501680 503520 Had. Border collie.
504280 505280 Barry.
505560 506800 Sorry for your loss.
507720 508880 Border collie, huh?
509400 510520 That's a cool dog.
511400 512840 Did he play fetch and stuff?
512920 514080 He loved fetch.
515960 517000 What?
517280 518680 Nothing. I just...
519040 521000 That's just awesome.
540960 541960 Damn it, Gabe.
542040 543280 Hi, Daveed.
546400 547560 Mind if I order first?
547840 549200 This won't take long.
555200 557200 Damn, I just bought these.
563200 565480 Hey, how's Gabe doing, anyway?
566360 567600 Did you hear about Thornton?
568600 569680 It's a tough way to go.
569760 571440 He only had 30 kilos on him.
571520 573360 Any idea where<br />we could find the rest?
574760 576720 - Chattahoochee.<br />- Georgia?
576800 578960 There's an area<br />called Blood Mountain.
579120 580560 When the plane's going down
580640 582480 the pilots know<br />where to drop our load.
583160 584520 And then we just go and get it.
584800 587040 I don't need a bunch<br />of worried Colombians.
587320 589200 Now, I want you<br />to take Eddie with you.
589360 590680 Eddie's in mourning.
590760 592400 Joanie just died.
592480 593480 And he quit.
593560 595480 Joanie's the reason why he quit.
595560 597000 She's not here anymore.
597080 599160 The sooner he moves on, the better.
599240 600560 Syd, I... I just don't...
601400 602400 Stop.
602720 605200 He won't even come<br />to get his goddamn son.
605360 608360 I am sick and tired<br />of watching my kid's kid.
608440 610360 Grandpa Syd, watch.
612160 613360 Yeah, that's great.
616200 618000 {\an5}I got to go. Shift starts at eight.
620080 622320 Tomorrow's lunch is in the fridge,<br />and the chicken's...
624600 626360 Chicken's in the microwave.<br />Just hit "start".
628680 630000 Thought you were off tonight.
630640 633560 We talked about this, remember?<br />Me picking up some extra shifts?
633640 634776 You said you were okay with it.
634800 638160 I was okay with it until I realized<br />why you want those extra shifts
638240 642040 so you could go and do<br />overtime with Ray the Pediatrician.
643920 646040 Gross, Dee Dee. Gross.
647680 649200 You know, he invited us
649280 651600 to go to Nashville this weekend<br />to see his band play.
651920 654280 We were supposed to go paint<br />the waterfall this weekend.
654360 656000 I know, but it's gonna be fun.
656080 657736 We're gonna make<br />a whole weekend out of it.
657760 658800 It's Nashville.
659960 661680 He's a good guy, Deirdra.
663480 665600 - Just give him a chance.<br />- Give him a chance.
665840 667680 - Please don't do that.<br />- Please don't do that.
667800 668840 Do what?
670400 671800 You know what.
673360 675240 We'll paint the waterfall<br />another weekend, okay?
678040 679480 Close my door.
687120 688760 That's enough for today.
689520 690560 Wait, what?
692400 693400 Hey, Eddie.
695320 697320 They spelled her name wrong, Daveed.
699840 701280 It says "John".
701800 702880 Says "John."
703840 705920 - Her name is fucking Joan.<br />- Look, we...
706120 707440 - We could get it fixed.<br />- No.
707520 709400 I got to wait a week<br />for it to heal first.
709480 711800 I got seven more days of "John".
712000 713400 <i>The chutist has been identified</i>
713480 715520 <i>as Andrew Thornton<br />of Paris, Kentucky.</i>
716240 717840 - Wait, is that us?<br />- Hey.
718480 721160 Listen, Syd is worried<br />about you, all right?
721800 723680 Says you haven't seen Gabe in weeks.
725920 728120 I'm so sad, man.
728400 731600 I'm so fucking sad. Okay?
738400 740880 Can I get the... the penne, please?
742680 744336 Does it come with chicken,<br />or is it just...
744360 745680 It's just plain.
757800 758840 I knew you'd be late.
758920 760880 It finally came in. Check it out.
761760 763440 How many weeks' allowance is that?
763520 765360 Like a thousand, but worth it.
765440 766600 Can I use the toilet?
766680 769720 No. My mom is gonna be home soon.
769800 772240 And we got to go if we want<br />to get to the falls by lunch.
773160 774200 Why by lunch?
775000 776680 The light, Henry.
777400 778760 But I got to go pee.
779200 780200 Go outside.
781080 784880 Why do I skip school with you?<br />You're bossier than the teachers.
785400 786560 Now, the adoption people
786640 788400 I'm not sure<br />who I talked to over there
788480 790560 told me I was supposed<br />to be getting me a Lab.
791000 794400 A fun one, a...<br />a man's-best-friend type.
794840 796056 I don't know if there was an error
796080 798640 because the one I got<br />is just kind of...
798880 800640 - Bob?<br />- I don't know
800720 802080 just kind of fancy.
802160 804400 - Bob, Captain says it's time to go.<br />- Got it.
805080 806760 Hey, look, I'm gonna<br />have to call you back.
808120 809160 Hey, Reba.
809800 811200 You got plans for tonight?
813560 815160 Bob, you're a nice guy.
815240 817120 - I just don't...<br />- Mind looking after Rosette?
819680 822000 I have to go to Georgia<br />for the Thornton case
822080 823520 and you said you were good at dogs.
823600 825440 I said I had a dog.
825640 827880 You don't have jurisdiction<br />in Georgia.
828440 831200 A trucker overheard a couple of guys<br />talking at a bar last night.
831920 833040 I'll tell you in the car.
833120 834120 No...
834360 835840 Pretty sure they're Syd's guys.
835920 838000 Oh, come on. You got to be<br />sort of good with them.
838640 840200 I only had her for a day.
840400 841400 Please?
842280 844400 I don't know if I could trust<br />anyone else around here.
847320 849200 Just go. We'll be fine.
850840 851840 Thanks.
854360 856120 Can't believe I left the backpack.
856200 857720 I can. I know the way.
857800 859280 School's gonna call, you know.
859560 860760 You know what? Let 'em.
861400 863120 And your mom's gonna be pissed.
864040 865160 So is your dad.
865400 866800 He doesn't care if I play hooky.
867360 868736 For a girl who likes to be left alone
868760 870160 you do a lot of shit for attention.
870200 873056 Look, I'm not ditching for attention.<br />I just want to paint the waterfall.
873080 875680 Admit it. You want her<br />to find out and worry about you.
905920 906960 Jesus! Fuck!
908480 910680 Coral, it's Sari.<br />Is Dee Dee over there?
910960 912040 School just called.
913040 914080 No.
914520 916160 Yeah, well,<br />can you just put Elliot on?
917760 919440 Yes, well, his daughter<br />just ditched school
919520 921480 so can you please just put him on?
923960 926120 Every time I call,<br />he's in the bathroom.
926200 927760 What the hell is wrong with him?
929920 930920 Never mind.
973040 974080 50 cents.
981360 983960 I'm not gonna see that wrapper<br />outside on the ground, now, am I?
984040 985080 No, ma'am.
985160 987120 You one of those kids<br />caused me a bunch of shit?
987200 988200 What?
988280 989320 Empty your pockets.
990040 991600 Vest pocket. Come on.
995440 996600 Is that perfume?
997000 998320 That's none of your business.
998400 1000680 Well, it smells really nice.
1000760 1002960 Yeah, well, it's European.
1003040 1004040 Oh.
1004120 1005800 Yeah, I'm expecting someone<br />in a minute.
1006320 1008160 - Is it too much?<br />- Not at all.
1008640 1009920 Smells expensive.
1010680 1012160 Well, it is.
1013520 1014560 You want a sucker?
1015120 1016160 Sure.
1017120 1019200 - I like the green one.<br />- This is a red one.
1020200 1021200 Yes, ma'am.
1023440 1025680 Oh, shit. He's here.
1036200 1037960 Am I in the right place?
1040240 1041240 Oh!
1041720 1043200 Right. Told you it was big.
1043280 1044720 Oh, it's big.
1046320 1047320 What's that smell?
1047600 1048640 It's European.
1050800 1052240 Someone been smoking?
1053360 1054360 He was.
1054440 1055496 - Can you believe it?<br />- What?
1055520 1057240 You know, cigarettes kill people.
1057320 1058760 - Yeah, but...<br />- And animals.
1058840 1061800 Forest fires are the number one<br />cause of death for wildlife.
1061880 1063776 Yeah, and you... you should<br />be educating yourself
1063800 1066440 instead of endangering<br />the entire ecosystem.
1066520 1067520 Just get out of here.
1068640 1069680 Get out.
1070520 1072200 Unbelievable.
1073560 1075080 You got a dusty beaver here, Ranger.
1075160 1076560 Yeah, well, I'm working on that.
1098880 1100000 Hey, Henry!
1101440 1104000 It looks like the deer<br />on this sign are doing it!
1104520 1105520 Hold on.
1107480 1110000 Seriously, what the hell<br />are you even doing?
1110600 1112000 Marking our territory.
1112480 1113800 Don't shit out here!
1114120 1115560 I'm not shitting.
1120000 1122760 Hey. Did your mom pack<br />double lunch for school again?
1123240 1125280 My dad didn't have a chance<br />to make any.
1126080 1127120 Hey, Henry.
1136560 1137640 Check it out.
1141720 1143080 It's drugs, I think.
1143400 1144560 It's drugs?
1144760 1146680 Remember that guy from assembly?
1146960 1149760 He showed us pictures of stuff<br />that looked just like this.
1149840 1151480 Yeah. The guy from Vietnam<br />with no legs.
1151680 1152680 No.
1153560 1155120 This is definitely cocaine.
1155600 1159760 Yeah. Of course. I'm just<br />not used to seeing it like that.
1160280 1163200 You know, it's usually<br />more powdery on the streets.
1164280 1166560 When have you seen cocaine<br />on the streets?
1166640 1167720 When I do it.
1167800 1169640 Oh, yeah? With who?
1169720 1170840 With Faulk.
1171800 1172840 After church.
1172920 1174920 Faulk does not do cocaine<br />after church.
1175000 1176056 Are you friends with Faulk?
1176080 1177240 No. He's a pervert.
1177320 1178360 Then you wouldn't know.
1179040 1180640 - Liar.<br />- You're just mad
1180720 1181960 you're never invited.
1182040 1183760 I don't care I'm not invited.
1184400 1185600 Sounds like you care.
1187800 1188800 Do some, then.
1191000 1192040 What?
1192360 1194120 You've done it before.<br />You can do it again.
1194560 1197760 Well, we're exercising, though.<br />Shooting and stuff.
1197840 1200720 I mean, I can't do cocaine<br />while shooting and exercising.
1200880 1201880 That wouldn't be good.
1202120 1203120 Fine.
1203840 1204840 Knife me.
1213240 1215720 Okay, so how do I do it?
1216800 1217800 You eat it.
1219000 1220000 How much?
1220320 1222240 Like a tablespoon's worth.
1233680 1234760 Oh!
1235360 1237200 Son of a bitch!
1238080 1240200 Oh, what the hell?
1242440 1243440 Rookie.
1245200 1246240 You do it, then.
1262440 1263480 Shit!
1264400 1265880 What the hell?
1265960 1268040 This isn't as good<br />as the shit I normally do.
1274240 1276360 How much do you think<br />this stuff is worth?
1276640 1277880 Let's sell drugs together.
1277960 1280560 Yeah, we could sell them<br />on the street like you and Faulk.
1281760 1282880 There's more.
1285840 1286840 Ow.
1289120 1290640 Something got into it.
1292080 1293240 A deer, maybe.
1293360 1294480 Could you imagine that?
1294840 1296040 Deer on cocaine?
1296280 1297320 It'd be like this.
1297400 1299680 Yeah, it'd be, like,<br />going into trees like... bang!
1299760 1301400 - Bang!<br />- Yep, and then it'd get stuck.
1301480 1303280 Yeah, and then it'd be so sad.
1303360 1304360 Hey, Dee Dee.
1304440 1306560 Do you think<br />my dad has ever done cocaine?
1307000 1309200 Your dad has definitely done cocaine.
1312480 1313840 My throat's really runny.
1317320 1318320 Stop that.
1330680 1332000 Did it do the cocaine?
1332880 1335520 Don't move a muscle.
1342200 1346040 <i>Listen to me. You were supposed<br />to grab Eddie, not run your mouth.</i>
1346120 1347600 <i>Now we have trouble. You understand?</i>
1347680 1349480 Got it. I'll take care of it.
1350560 1352400 <i>Gabe, knock that off. Gabe.</i>
1352480 1353480 <i>Grandpa Syd!</i>
1353560 1355400 <i>Gabe, driving me nuts. Little...</i>
1356000 1357000 Fuck.
1385080 1386480 Joan loved this song.
1388320 1391360 She said he sang with the soul<br />of a thousand-year-old man.
1396400 1397800 Eddie, listen.
1399360 1400680 When Joanie died
1402000 1404200 I'm sorry I didn't, you know...
1405960 1406960 It's fine.
1407480 1409240 No, I could've did more.
1409320 1410920 - It's fine.<br />- I should've been there.
1411000 1412000 I didn't need you there.
1412080 1413736 I don't hang out<br />with drug dealers anymore.
1413760 1415080 It's against my constitution.
1415520 1417000 I'm more than a drug dealer.
1417200 1419120 - No, you're not.<br />- Come on, Eddie.
1419480 1420480 We're friends, right?
1420560 1421560 No.
1422400 1423400 Fine.
1424800 1426520 I think he's happy she's dead.
1426600 1427920 He's not happy she died.
1428040 1430200 Blamed her for me leaving<br />the family business
1430280 1431600 if we can call it that.
1433240 1434320 Sometimes...
1435000 1436640 I wonder if he did it to her.
1436720 1439000 What? No, Joanie died of cancer.
1439080 1440080 I know.
1440160 1441720 Maybe he gave her the cancer.
1441800 1443160 You can't give no one cancer.
1443240 1445040 Yes, you can. With stress.
1445120 1446520 Stop protecting him.
1447520 1448736 You know what?<br />Maybe I should turn this off.
1448760 1449760 No!
1458840 1459840 Okay.
1464000 1466160 Okay, so we start...
1466520 1468440 - Did you notice my nails?<br />- Those are beautiful.
1468480 1469816 - Thank you. We start...<br />- Excuse me.
1469840 1470960 Is the ranger in?
1471920 1473280 I'm wearing the stuff.
1473600 1477960 Oh. Did either of you see a girl,<br />13, come through here?
1478040 1479736 - My daughter...<br />- You lost your daughter in the park.
1479760 1482000 Well, she came here on her own,<br />heading to the waterfall.
1482080 1484960 Yeah. Hikers under 16<br />must be accompanied by an adult.
1485040 1487120 Well, I didn't know<br />she was coming here.
1487400 1490080 You know, we get<br />a lot of runaways, bad apples
1490160 1493040 youngsters who aren't too happy<br />with the way things are at home.
1493120 1495240 She's not a runaway.<br />She just came to paint the...
1495320 1498000 Can someone just please point me<br />in the direction of Blood Mountain?
1498880 1500280 This is Blood Mountain.
1500640 1502136 - Sorry. I'm... I'm Peter.<br />- Oh. This is Peter
1502160 1503360 wildlife inspection rep.
1503440 1505200 We're about<br />to head up there ourselves.
1505280 1506920 Oh. Do you mind if I tag along?
1507200 1509800 Now, Peter, the wildlife inspection<br />is a very important process.
1509880 1513520 We wouldn't want you distracted by<br />our little damsel in distress here.
1513600 1515400 Nothing can distract me<br />from making sure
1515480 1518960 the entire biological community<br />is safe for all our friends.
1519040 1520080 Friends?
1520160 1521920 - He means animals.<br />- I don't like that word.
1522320 1524200 He doesn't like to call them animals.
1524520 1526000 Well, I won't be a burden.
1528480 1529560 I'll get my hat.
1531440 1532440 Okay.
1537120 1538400 Shoes okay for hiking?
1538600 1540440 Oh, yeah. I think I'll be okay.
1540640 1542120 - I have on boots.<br />- Yep.
1543000 1545000 Come on, Eddie.<br />I'm done playing this game.
1545080 1547520 You... you wanted... You were<br />the one who wanted to play this.
1547960 1549640 You still have three more questions.
1550240 1551880 - Listen.<br />- What?
1553560 1554856 I'm tired of playing<br />this fucking game.
1554880 1556600 No, you're not.<br />You just don't want to lose.
1557040 1559200 I'm-a go in here<br />and take a piss, all right?
1564360 1566520 I didn't know rangers carried guns.
1566960 1568840 Park rangers are peace officers.
1569560 1571160 Which means we can shoot people.
1572000 1573520 Forest is a dangerous place.
1573720 1575760 That gang of pubes are dangerous.
1575960 1577120 "Gang of pubes"?
1577200 1578360 Teens. Delinquents.
1581160 1582840 They've been attacking hikers.
1583280 1584360 They hurt anyone?
1584560 1586040 They cut them with a knife.
1587680 1589520 Call themselves the Doochamps.
1590320 1591320 Watch your back.
1592600 1594680 Pop-art punks pop up out of nowhere.
1595280 1596480 Out of nowhere.
1610800 1611800 Fuck is this?
1613600 1615320 He's afraid, buds.
1615880 1617200 Empty your pockets.
1618400 1620880 - No.<br />- Empty your pockets, please.
1623440 1624880 Since you asked so nicely.
1626960 1628760 You think this is a joke?
1630120 1631160 I do.
1631480 1632560 Get him, buds.
1633360 1634656 I'm shaking a fucking knife,<br />man. Come on.
1634680 1636416 - Just stab him.<br />- Come on, man. It's a fucking knife!
1636440 1637440 Go on!
1643160 1645840 - Come on, Rocky...<br />- Ah! <i>Banzai</i>!
1647560 1649400 Give me this fucking board!
1651640 1652680 You're going down, man!
1660040 1661600 Submit...!
1661800 1662840 What the...
1666160 1667200 Hold this!
1668280 1669400 Fucking skateboard!
1681800 1683200 Oh, my.
1696560 1698240 The fuck is wrong with y'all?
1698320 1699720 Shit!
1701520 1702560 I love this road.
1702640 1703800 Ah, love it up there.
1703880 1705816 So, wait, where is it<br />that you wanted to go again?
1705840 1707120 What? The falls.
1707200 1708256 - The Secret Falls. Right, we can<br />- I thought...
1708280 1710400 - go up this way or take the loop.<br />- I love the loop.
1710480 1713000 - Well, you can see the top of the...<br />- This is a more direct...
1713840 1715120 All right. We're going this way.
1715600 1716680 Well, crap.
1717080 1718880 Told you she shouldn't<br />have come with us.
1719680 1721600 Just distracting you completely.
1721680 1722800 She can hear you.
1722880 1725080 I wanted to get up to see the sunset.
1726800 1728040 What's taking you so long?
1729120 1730160 What'd you do?
1740480 1742240 Please tell me<br />you found them like this.
1742480 1743480 They attacked me.
1743560 1745600 - Are they dead?<br />- Well, one might be.
1745680 1747440 The... the one that stabbed me<br />might be dead.
1750800 1753000 Jesus Chr... They're kids.
1753240 1755320 I loved this fucking jersey, man.
1755400 1756840 Okay, they're fine.
1757200 1758200 Thank God.
1759400 1760480 No fucking way.
1762440 1763480 Daveed?
1771280 1772800 - What happened?<br />- Hey.
1773360 1774400 Wake up.
1774480 1775680 Where'd you find this?
1777240 1779600 Where is this energy<br />coming from, bud?
1779680 1781000 You tried to fucking kill me.
1781480 1783200 You got a foul mouth there, bud.
1783280 1784680 I tell him that all the time.
1785760 1787920 Where did you find this?
1788160 1789160 Up on the mountain.
1789240 1790240 Where's the rest of it?
1790800 1791800 I don't know.
1791960 1795720 Listen, I just took out<br />the three of you in 15 seconds.
1795920 1798920 What do you think I'll do to just you<br />when you're already on the floor?
1799200 1800520 Okay...
1801360 1803320 We stashed it under a gazebo.
1804040 1805720 Going back for it later tonight.
1806280 1807320 A gazebo?
1807880 1810280 It's a pavilion-type structure.
1810360 1811920 I know what the fuck a gazebo is.
1812000 1813000 I didn't.
1814760 1816640 Are my buds dead?
1817120 1818720 - Show us where.<br />- Oh, God.
1818960 1822000 You know, I'm... I'm feeling<br />kind of tired. I think I should rest.
1822080 1823920 Okay. Want a dirt nap?
1824000 1825000 Eddie, go get the gun.
1825080 1826080 It's in the glove.
1826240 1827840 I prefer we left guns out of this.
1827920 1829680 Yeah. Same.
1829760 1832240 And I would prefer not to be stabbed.
1832840 1835600 So, Eddie, please go get<br />the fucking gun.
1835680 1836680 Okay.
1838960 1841760 Okay. All right... I'm coming.
1843320 1844360 Relax.
1853480 1854800 It's getting real cold out.
1870320 1871360 Let's go.
1874600 1875720 So, where you guys from?
1875800 1877360 Shut up. Keep walking.
1877760 1880240 Gonna be a long hike<br />if we can't talk to each other.
1880320 1881920 It better not be a long hike.
1882000 1883400 Friend's pretty serious, ain't he?
1883680 1884936 Well, I don't think he's too happy
1884960 1886336 after getting stabbed<br />in the shoulder.
1886360 1887360 Well, it wasn't me.
1888240 1889640 I don't blame him, though.
1889720 1890760 Getting stabbed sucks.
1890840 1892480 Hey, shut the fuck up.
1908240 1909440 Yeah, Reba, it's Bob.
1910480 1912240 I was wondering how Rosette is doing.
1912880 1915400 Realized I hadn't said<br />a proper goodbye. I...
1916520 1919360 I don't know if dogs think<br />about that sort of thing, but...
1921120 1922160 Anyway, I...
1925560 1926880 Thanks again for helping out.
1927240 1928240 Bye.
1931240 1932320 Look at this.
1932400 1934920 - Oh, no.<br />- Look at this mess.
1936080 1937680 People don't have any respect.
1937760 1939280 This is gonna end up in scat
1939360 1941120 - this plastic.<br />- I... Let me pick that up.
1941200 1942480 - Thank you, Ranger.<br />- Dee Dee!
1943200 1944200 That is sticking.
1944280 1945320 I got some oil in the car.
1945400 1947320 - Dee Dee! Henry!<br />- 'Cause if that stays open
1947400 1948560 critters can get in there.
1948640 1949680 Oh, yeah, critters.
1949760 1951320 What kind of critters? Huh?
1951400 1953280 - Squirrels?<br />- Squirrels could get in there.
1953360 1955360 - Chipmunks?<br />- Yeah, chipmunks get in there.
1955440 1956560 - Dee Dee!<br />- Skunks.
1956640 1957936 Raccoon, you know, little burglar.
1957960 1959936 - That's right. Yeah,<br />- Got his own little mask on.
1959960 1961176 - With their cute little outfit.<br />- I think they're cute.
1961200 1962800 - Skunks.<br />- Skunks.
1963160 1965360 - Possums.<br />- Possums. Definitely possums.
1965600 1966680 - Possum.<br />- Hey, possum.
1967560 1969000 Mrs. McKinndry!
1969720 1970720 Henry?
1970800 1972360 Here! Hello?
1972440 1974520 - Henry?<br />- Up here!
1977200 1978680 - Hey. Whoa.<br />- Oh.
1979160 1981360 Henry, what are you doing up there?
1981440 1983560 No... that's not safe at all.
1983640 1984680 - No.<br />- It's too high.
1984760 1986520 - You got to come down.<br />- Get down here.
1986600 1989720 Don't be mad, but we skipped school.
1989880 1991440 - No shit, Henry.<br />- It's high.
1991520 1992600 But there was a bear.
1992680 1994120 A really terrible bear.
1994200 1995600 - A bear?<br />- Yeah, I know.
1995680 1997400 - It was fucked!<br />- Hey!
1997720 1999160 That's inappropriate.
1999240 2002120 Sorry for cussing,<br />but it attacked me and Dee Dee.
2002200 2003560 It attacked you?
2003720 2005760 - Henry, where is Dee Dee?<br />- No...
2005840 2007640 Bears are very peaceful creatures.
2007720 2009360 You must have done something<br />to upset it.
2009440 2011120 - Yeah, did you feed it?<br />- What did you do?
2011200 2013360 Nothing! Y'all need to hide!
2013440 2015760 I'm telling you,<br />it's not just any bear!
2015960 2017800 You have to listen to me!
2017920 2019680 Henry, where is Dee Dee?
2019840 2021000 The monster took her.
2021600 2023680 Now, I'm not gonna<br />tell you again, little girl.
2023760 2025560 Get down here now.
2025800 2026800 A...
2028560 2029600 I...
2031200 2032200 Dee Dee!
2052400 2053400 Peter!
2053960 2055080 - Peter!<br />- No!
2059720 2061120 Oh! Oh, no!
2061800 2063680 It let me go! He ran off!
2063760 2065080 Henry, jump down.
2065160 2066200 It's too high.
2066680 2067680 Is it gone?
2067880 2068920 Do you see it?
2077000 2078000 Yeah.
2078080 2079920 Why are you shooting at me?
2080000 2081120 Get your ass down!
2081480 2082560 This is your fault.
2082640 2084000 Right behind you. I saw it.
2085160 2086200 Stay down.
2094920 2095920 What?
2113880 2115160 Help me!
2116720 2117720 Help!
2121800 2122920 Ranger!
2123560 2124560 Ranger!
2124640 2125680 Did it get you?
2126320 2127800 That asshole!
2127880 2128880 I'm gonna get him.
2129440 2130880 I'm gonna get that asshole.
2134160 2135200 I'll get help.
2135560 2136600 Where are you going?
2137000 2138080 God Almighty.
2138160 2139560 Hey. What...
2141920 2142920 Where is it?
2144960 2145960 Hey!
2148560 2149800 What should I do?
2150120 2151160 Motherfucker!
2151240 2152720 Come back! Help us!
2155520 2156920 Oh, fuck!
2162280 2163416 There's something wrong with it.
2163440 2164760 Yeah, I told you there was.
2165000 2166720 Why is it acting like this?
2167160 2168880 Did you feed it cocaine?
2169160 2171440 No. But you're safe.
2171520 2172880 Bears can't climb trees.
2173040 2174320 Of course they can!
2175080 2176280 Then, why are you up here?
2201240 2202800 It's okay...
2220080 2221080 Okay.
2237880 2238880 No.
2240920 2242040 Henry, climb.
2242280 2243320 Henry, go.
2243600 2244840 Climb...!
2244920 2245960 You got to get higher!
2246040 2247280 - Climb.<br />- Go, Henry!
2247680 2248680 Go!
2248840 2250400 - Henry, move!<br />- Go higher!
2253560 2255400 - Go up!<br />- Henry, go!
2256400 2258000 Oh, God.
2259760 2260840 Go, Henry! No!
2262080 2264360 No! Oh, God. Henry!
2279000 2280360 Oh, God.
2283000 2284040 Oh, shit.
2287720 2289800 No...!
2291800 2292920 Get off of me!
2293320 2294560 No...!
2294920 2296640 No! Get off of me!
2302960 2304760 Henry, jump! Jump down!
2305400 2306520 Move, Henry!
2313200 2315160 It's okay...<br />You're doing great.
2315320 2316880 You're almost there. Come on, baby.
2318360 2320360 Come on. Let's go. Come on.
2339960 2341880 Go. Hide. Come here...
2346920 2348200 That was so messed up.
2349200 2351320 That little man was<br />an expert on bears
2351760 2354440 but didn't know the bear<br />was the cocaine bear.
2354760 2356280 Wait. What did you say?
2356720 2358040 We found cocaine, Mrs. McKinndry.
2358080 2359576 There was cocaine in the forest,<br />and the bear ate it
2359600 2361520 and then went crazy on me and Dee Dee
2361600 2363520 and now on that guy back there.
2364160 2365640 Did you hear him scream?
2365800 2367200 He's so dead.
2368640 2370640 I'd love to not remember that.
2371400 2374640 But it kind of seems like the thing<br />that stays with a man forever.
2375640 2378800 Henry, when the bear<br />took Dee Dee, was she...
2378880 2380520 Alive? Yeah.
2380920 2382120 It chased her that way.
2383280 2384640 We got to go. Let's go.
2388640 2389640 He get at you, too?
2389720 2392000 - Fucking beast.<br />- Yeah, you can say that again.
2392320 2394200 - Call an ambulance.<br />- I already did.
2397040 2398040 Keep him awake.
2398120 2399320 Yeah, I've been trying.
2415240 2417480 You piles of shit!
2417560 2418560 You're the Doochamps!
2418640 2420040 Hey, that's... that's not ours.
2420120 2421160 We found it.
2424360 2425680 "It's not ours."
2426960 2428320 I'm a park ranger.
2428600 2429720 I'm not dumb.
2429800 2431480 - I know.<br />- They say
2431560 2434840 I can't keep my park safe,<br />that I'm unfit for the big leagues.
2434920 2437520 I'd have been at Yellowstone by now<br />if it weren't for you shits!
2437600 2438920 - Buds.<br />- Huh?
2439560 2441200 There's someone outside.
2441800 2444000 It's him. Get to the door...
2445320 2446320 Yeah.
2446400 2449560 Now, open it<br />when I... I count to three.
2450120 2451520 Wait...<br />But you're gonna shoot him?
2451600 2454240 Hell yes, I'm gonna shoot him!<br />He took a bite out of my ass!
2454560 2456800 What the fuck is wrong with this guy?
2457520 2459560 Now, open it when I say so.
2463000 2464000 Now.
2466600 2468200 That's a fucking bear.
2473960 2475760 What the fuck?
2483680 2484880 I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.
2484960 2486320 - You're sorry?<br />- I'm sorry.
2486400 2488120 - Where'd the bear go?<br />- You killed him.
2488200 2490040 - Where's the bear?<br />- I don't know!
2490120 2491120 Close the door!
2491200 2492600 Close the motherfucking door.
2493000 2494360 Jesus Christ.
2494440 2495560 Close the door.
2498040 2500640 Oh, God. I'm sorry, bud.
2506840 2509120 Keep your mouth shut.<br />Check over there.
2536520 2537560 He's up there.
2538640 2539680 He's up there.
2569240 2570280 I got it.
2571000 2572120 I got it.
2582080 2583360 Maybe the kid can help you.
2583440 2585400 Look, I'm done playing this game.
2585840 2587520 - What game?<br />- 20 questions.
2587600 2589840 Daveed's so fucking cold.<br />It's unbelievable.
2589920 2590920 What did he ask so far?
2591000 2592120 He just keeps guessing.
2592200 2595480 Like, "Is it a spider?<br />Is it an arrow?"
2596400 2598200 What are you, new?
2599560 2601480 Hey, start broad,<br />then narrow it down.
2601560 2602600 Everybody knows that.
2602800 2604200 Look, are we close to the gazebo?
2604280 2605840 Is that one of your questions?
2606240 2608800 - Oh, is it bigger than a bread box?<br />- No... Daveed needs to ask.
2610520 2612400 Ask him if it's bigger<br />than a bread box.
2613840 2616000 Is it bigger than a bread box?
2617600 2618600 Yes.
2618920 2619920 Yeah!
2620000 2621320 Is it Abraham Lincoln?
2621680 2623360 What? No.
2623880 2626520 Broad, then narrow it down, man.
2627280 2628800 You have one question left.
2682280 2683320 Dee Dee!
2684400 2685400 Dee Dee!
2685600 2686920 You sure this is the way?
2687360 2688400 Pretty sure.
2694120 2696200 Dee Dee! It's okay. It's Mama.
2702080 2703120 Thank God.
2703480 2705120 Ew! What the heck?
2705200 2707040 It's paint. It's just red paint.
2707400 2709800 It looks a lot like blood.<br />How can you be sure?
2709880 2711120 I'm a nurse, Henry.
2711640 2712680 Good point.
2714400 2715400 Come on.
2719600 2721520 Oh, smart girl.
2724120 2726280 Henry, come on. She left us a trail.
2726360 2729480 Mrs. McKinndry,<br />have you ever done cocaine?
2729560 2730560 What?
2731280 2732360 Why do you ask?
2732880 2735960 Just wondering<br />if it has long-term side effects
2736040 2739040 for the bear, of course,<br />if it just did a little bit.
2739120 2741480 Well, it could create a habit<br />for the bear.
2741760 2743800 What if they never want<br />to do it again?
2744120 2745680 Oh, then it... it should be fine.
2746960 2749520 But Mama Bear and Papa Bear<br />would be very angry
2749600 2753720 because drugs, especially cocaine,<br />are very, very bad.
2753800 2755400 What if they would never find out?
2755680 2756680 Oh, Henry.
2757120 2758560 We always find out.
2759160 2760160 Dee Dee!
2785840 2786880 Medic!
2787200 2789080 - Just open it.<br />- Yeah, open it. You think?
2789160 2790480 Can you just push? Harder.
2792000 2793056 - I'm doing it as hard as...<br />- Just let...
2793080 2794336 - All right. You go...<br />- Let me do it.
2794360 2795880 Yeah. Please, show me how it's done.
2798920 2800440 Go ahead, Beth. You're strong, right?
2800520 2802400 Oh, yes, I am. Let me see.
2803160 2804400 What is that?
2804920 2806600 - See anything?<br />- Just, can you...
2806680 2807720 - Can you help...?<br />- Yeah.
2807800 2809496 What happened to feminism, huh?<br />Is that dead?
2809520 2811160 - Come on.<br />- Wait. Okay, wait...
2813880 2815200 Oh, fuck.
2815920 2817520 - Come on.<br />- God, I'm trying.
2817600 2818800 Come on, push.
2819720 2820720 I'm trying.
2821080 2822800 You said they called in a concussion.
2825200 2826200 They did.
2831000 2832160 Jesus.
2832360 2833720 - This guy's been shot.<br />- Yeah.
2833880 2835000 Obviously.
2837600 2840000 Holy shit. It's the ranger.
2840080 2841080 Tom.
2841160 2842800 Come here. She's got a gun.
2845200 2846400 Tom! Hello?
2849400 2851200 No... Put that down...
2851840 2852840 It's okay.
2853120 2855040 - B...<br />- Did you shoot that guy?
2855560 2856560 B...
2857600 2859200 - B...<br />- "Buh"?
2868760 2870880 B... B...
2883400 2884400 Beth?
2884480 2885760 It's okay... Calm.
2915320 2916480 Beth, we should go.
2918040 2919440 It's okay...
2928560 2929560 Bear.
2931360 2932360 Bear.
2935120 2936120 Let's go.
2936720 2938000 Tom, get up!
2943360 2944400 Don't look back...
2949880 2951080 Hang on. Push.
2957000 2958040 Oh, shit.
2958680 2959720 Sorry...
2966760 2967760 Come on...
2967840 2970216 <i>Anybody else surprised by that rain<br />this morning? I know I was.</i>
2970240 2971520 Leave him!
2989760 2990880 <i>Our next story, the weather</i>
2990960 2992176 - <i>at the top of the hour, but first</i><br />- Go! Drive!
2992200 2995320 <i>More of your favorite hits<br />here on 103.7 BOB FM.</i>
2996520 2997520 Tom, get in!
2997600 2998600 Wait...!
2999120 3000160 - Wait!<br />- Oh, God.
3002400 3003400 Oh, shit!
3005520 3007480 Jesus, Beth, I wasn't even on yet!
3007560 3009200 What the fuck is wrong<br />with that bear?
3012280 3013840 What the hell have you got a gun for?
3013920 3015200 Hey, move! Move!
3015280 3016280 Put that away!
3020080 3022000 Jesus Christ! Shoot it...!
3024200 3025520 - Oh, shit!<br />- Kill it!
3025760 3027560 Not the tree! The big fucking bear!
3027640 3029440 - Shut up!<br />- Why is it chasing us?
3031160 3032960 Tom, try to shut the fucking door!
3033040 3035200 Close the fucking door, you dumbass!
3035280 3036760 Guys, you got to stop yelling at me!
3041440 3042440 Oh, shit.
3044880 3046120 Beth, speed up!
3063840 3065000 Oh, shit.
3105000 3107280 I don't know<br />how to talk to him, you know.
3107360 3111000 Like, what... what do you say<br />to a kid who just lost his mommy?
3112320 3115160 My mom is the reason<br />I'm the man I am today.
3115520 3116720 And what a man you are.
3116920 3118480 Attacking innocent people<br />for no reason.
3118520 3119520 Can you not?
3119760 3121920 I'm sorry. Just continue.
3122000 3125920 Well, when my daddy died,<br />my mama bought me this pet lizard.
3126000 3127760 It was the coolest little thing.
3127840 3129880 It had all these green scales on it.
3130160 3132560 She used to call it a tiny dinosaur.
3132640 3134120 I thought that was so awesome.
3134600 3136560 I was real bad<br />at connecting with people
3136640 3140040 but I practiced conversation starters<br />on that lizard every day.
3140800 3142920 And then that's how<br />I met Rocky and Joe.
3144320 3145680 That's my team, man.
3146240 3148920 We're planning on moving<br />to New York City together.
3150320 3152760 Those are my buds, man.
3153600 3155240 So I should get Gabe a lizard?
3155520 3157320 Well, you know what?
3158040 3160200 Lizards are good listeners, bud...
3161640 3162800 but people...
3163480 3165400 people are good at hearing.
3169600 3172400 That's the sweetest thing<br />I ever heard. Thank you.
3172920 3174160 - Can we...<br />- It's okay.
3174240 3175240 Y'all are hugging.
3176560 3177600 It's okay.
3181400 3182800 Where the fuck is the gazebo?
3253960 3257280 Can I say something<br />without you getting angry with me?
3258840 3260680 I'm already angry with you.
3264200 3265200 It's gone.
3266960 3268280 What the actual...
3268520 3269680 - Daveed, stop.<br />- No! Please!
3269760 3270760 - No...<br />- Please!
3270840 3272296 - The kid's messing with us, Eddie.<br />- No...! I'm not...!
3272320 3275000 I promise. I don't know<br />where it went. It's just gone.
3275640 3277320 Okay, well,<br />duffel bags don't have legs.
3277560 3279480 Since you're the only one<br />that knew where it was
3279680 3281600 I'm-a give you one more chance.
3281680 3283000 Where's the ba...
3283080 3286560 Put the gun down<br />and move away from the teenager.
3287400 3292040 Drop the weapon and step away<br />about five to ten paces.
3292160 3294400 All right, listen.<br />Just calm down, all right?
3294520 3295680 I ain't fucking around!
3296800 3297800 Just do it.
3300960 3301960 Fuck.
3303120 3304680 - You don't want to do this.<br />- Shut up!
3304920 3306200 I'm coming down there.
3327800 3331120 I'm just trying to find<br />a safe spot to hop down.
3331320 3332480 How did you get up there?
3332560 3334680 Well, I jumped from<br />that tree over there, but...
3335240 3336600 I hurt my hip a little.
3336680 3338480 I can try to catch you if you want.
3338560 3340560 No...! You stay right where you are!
3342960 3344360 Let's see...
3344440 3345440 Get it.
3347320 3348320 Fuck!
3350280 3351280 Fuck!
3352520 3354240 Well, you brought that<br />on yourself, kid.
3354360 3356800 Oh, yeah?<br />I shot my own fucking fingers?
3356880 3358480 I told you not to move!
3358640 3361160 How'd he take those two fingers off?
3361520 3363200 They're not even next to each other.
3365040 3366080 Fuck you!
3367800 3368800 Come out of there!
3369240 3370800 Shit! Come on out!
3370880 3372000 No fucking way!
3374120 3375840 God! Goddamn it!
3377200 3379040 You two, on your bellies.
3379480 3381240 Now! And no more moving.
3381800 3383400 Eddie...!
3384040 3385280 Can you grab them for me?
3385440 3386520 Can I grab his fingers?
3386680 3388040 Okay. Get 'em...
3389480 3391000 Slow...
3393800 3394800 Easy.
3395160 3396200 God.
3399320 3401160 - All right.<br />- Now, you get back on your belly.
3401800 3402920 I'll hold on to these.
3409280 3410360 Now, where you at?
3411800 3412800 Shit.
3414920 3415960 What?
3416040 3417320 Oh, no. The river.
3419600 3420640 Henry, look.
3421760 3423000 That's Dee Dee's sweater.
3423320 3425120 - Come on.<br />- So we're crossing?
3425480 3426640 We're on the right track.
3426960 3427960 I can feel it.
3444200 3445200 Mama?
3447160 3448200 Fuck.
3449320 3450520 Fuck, man.
3451040 3453080 My fucking jersey, man.
3455320 3457240 How long are you gonna<br />keep us like this?
3457520 3460720 Until that guy in the gazebo<br />throws his weapon into the woods.
3460960 3462360 Well, then we'll be here forever.
3462440 3464800 Hasn't Syd already<br />messed your life up enough?
3465280 3467240 We don't need to die because of this.
3467440 3468440 Eddie
3468720 3469880 - I got this.<br />- Do you?
3470480 3472240 I have your fingers in my pocket.
3472640 3474120 You're all gonna get arrested.
3474200 3476400 Drug sentences since Nixon are fucked
3476480 3481160 so get ready for ten to 15 years<br />of shitting in front of your cellmate
3481320 3482800 and supervised shower time.
3482920 3485400 Detective, Your Honor, sir,<br />I'm not with them.
3485480 3486680 I've never even done coke.
3486760 3488520 I mean, maybe once.
3488600 3490560 Once at a party once.<br />I can't go to jail.
3490640 3492256 - Just saying, I can't shit<br />- You're not going to jail.
3492280 3495080 In front of people. I've never<br />been able to shit in front of people.
3495320 3496680 I like to shit in peace.
3502520 3504200 Nobody move.
3506200 3507240 It's a bear.
3507640 3508640 Yeah.
3508880 3510000 No...
3510600 3512560 I'm not falling for none of your...
3535120 3537240 - Oh, fuck.<br />- Hey, y'all just stay still.
3537520 3538520 Don't move.
3538600 3539600 Just play dead.
3591680 3592680 Oh, fuck.
3601280 3602400 Oh, man. You fucked.
3602760 3603760 Eddie, can you breathe?
3604240 3605600 What the fuck?
3605760 3607160 I think that's a yes.
3607920 3609600 Can someone do something?
3609680 3611080 Maybe your boy can do something.
3611680 3614560 Can you just, like... move it?
3614640 3616880 Oh, of course.<br />Why didn't I think of that?
3621240 3622360 Dee Dee!
3623160 3625520 Henry, stay close.<br />I haven't seen paint in a while.
3628120 3629240 Oh, God.
3630280 3631280 Look.
3631440 3632440 Hello.
3634840 3636680 Is he okay?
3637520 3640120 Help me, please.
3640320 3641560 Does he have food?
3642160 3644120 Her name was Elsa
3644680 3647120 and she was so beautiful.
3648840 3650360 Are... are you... are you hurt?
3650440 3651520 Were you attacked?
3652560 3653600 Devil bear.
3654520 3655816 My... I'm looking for my daughter.
3655840 3658000 She was attacked by the devil bear.<br />Have you seen her?
3658520 3660120 You have? Was she alive?
3660200 3661240 Yes.
3661800 3663416 Please, can you just point<br />to where she went?
3663440 3665721 Please, can you show me?<br />I'm looking for her. I haven't...
3666080 3667120 Henry!
3679760 3682560 I'll show you... Come.
3688320 3689760 It's not moving.
3692080 3693240 I think it died.
3693320 3695240 It died on top of me?
3695320 3696440 Check its pulse.
3696680 3698520 Can you, like, feel it breathing?
3698880 3700200 I'm not sure.
3703840 3704840 Hey, guy?
3705040 3706080 Detective.
3706280 3709040 Can we call a truce<br />so I can see if the bear is dead?
3709400 3710400 Yeah.
3714680 3715680 Fuck.
3720400 3721440 You okay?
3721920 3723120 What do you think?
3740920 3742240 St... Still breathing.
3742760 3743920 We should go.
3744840 3746800 He'll probably be all right.
3747520 3749120 What the hell, man?
3749200 3750400 He's gonna wake up eventually.
3750480 3752160 Well, that's exactly<br />what I'm afraid of.
3752400 3753400 "She."
3753520 3754520 What?
3755040 3756320 The bear is a girl.
3756400 3758160 Oh, yeah.<br />How... How do you know that?
3758640 3760880 Because its vagina is on my ear.
3763520 3765080 Oh, shit. She's moving.
3765400 3766400 She's awake.
3766840 3768400 Oh, shit. Well, stay back...
3770240 3771240 Okay.
3775480 3776560 Chill out. Just chill out!
3777040 3778520 Homes, hey...
3778600 3779640 Stay back.
3784320 3785560 What the hell?
3786440 3788040 Okay...
3790920 3792520 No... Don't eat that.<br />Don't eat that.
3794120 3795840 I will be goddamned.
3796160 3797720 - Should we shoot her?<br />- No.
3798600 3800600 Let's see what kind of effect<br />that has on it.
3802720 3804240 What the fuck?
3817320 3818680 No...!
3819040 3820760 - Eddie!<br />- Daveed, help.
3822000 3823000 What is this?
3823640 3826320 - No... What is it doing?<br />- Okay, I have...
3826400 3827760 I... I don't like this.
3827840 3828840 Please stop.
3829200 3830600 Just go limp! Slide down!
3830680 3831680 I'm limp already.
3833600 3835360 - Shoot the bear! Shoot her!<br />- Don't shoot!
3835520 3837320 No... Don't shoot...
3837400 3839536 Eddie, you got to fight back,<br />alright? It's playing with you.
3839560 3840880 I'd stay still if I were you.
3840960 3843080 Bud, just tap out, bud.<br />Bud, tap out!
3843200 3845096 Eddie, please don't die like this.<br />Eddie, please.
3845120 3846160 Daveed!
3846600 3849480 All we've been through! Come on!<br />Come on, help him!
3849560 3851480 Get lower. You're not listening!
3852640 3853640 Eddie.
3854040 3855520 Oh, my God. He's gonna die.
3857640 3858640 No!
3858720 3859760 Hey, girl.
3869280 3870480 There you go, girl.
3871880 3872920 There you go.
3874760 3875800 There you go.
3876600 3879040 It's like cocaine Christmas.
3894560 3895560 Go!
3895880 3897480 Don't have to tell me twice.
3901200 3902920 Come on! Daveed!
3903080 3904720 That bag's worth 14 million.
3905000 3907600 We had a truce,<br />and a truce is on God where I'm from.
3908240 3910880 Can't you see I'm trying<br />to help you, kid? Go!
3910960 3912680 I need that bag.
3912760 3914560 Leave it, man. Let's just go home.
3915040 3916920 We're taking that bag to Syd, Eddie.
3926920 3927960 Shot...
3930520 3932120 No. I didn't.
3936440 3937960 Run! Go...!
3939640 3940640 Oh, shit.
3955840 3957000 Holy shit.
3957200 3958200 - Dad.<br />- Oh, shit.
3958280 3959280 What are you doing here?
3959640 3961336 Where's Gabe?<br />You didn't bring him here, did you?
3961360 3962400 Calm down.
3962480 3964560 He's safe at home watching TV.
3964640 3966600 What? How long has he been alone?
3966880 3968480 You left him with me!
3968640 3970920 Do I look like<br />"daddy day care center" to you?
3971960 3972960 Huh?
3974640 3975720 The fuck happened to you?
3976040 3977040 A lot.
3977360 3979240 - Did you get the coke?<br />- A little.
3979680 3981360 The bear ate most of it.
3981840 3983480 - What?<br />- The bear.
3983960 3985760 It fucking did cocaine.
3986040 3987040 A fucking...
3987120 3989480 A bear did cocaine, Dad!
3989560 3993280 Fuck this! Seriously,<br />fuck this entire journey.
3993600 3995200 Eddie... just calm down.
3995280 3997680 Look at me...
3998240 3999880 I'm on the hook here.
4000120 4004480 A lot of cocaine was lost<br />under my eye.
4004880 4006280 And the people that I deal with
4006360 4009040 they don't care how,<br />just that it was.
4009120 4010280 And look at me.
4010360 4013960 They're gonna come after me,<br />my family
4014040 4016680 if I don't get them<br />every penny's worth.
4017680 4019000 You hear what I'm saying?
4019320 4021000 It's you and Gabe.
4022160 4023400 You understand?
4025800 4027320 We don't have a choice.
4030400 4032640 There's a bag<br />with the cop and the bear
4032720 4034480 over at the pavilion structure.
4036760 4037760 Come on.
4040720 4041800 Come on, son. Come on.
4049400 4050480 Who's there?
4051880 4053400 - Easy.<br />- Stay away.
4053600 4054760 Where's the duffel?
4055080 4056520 I gave it to the bear.
4056920 4058360 You gave it to the bear?
4058440 4060200 Yeah. The bear.
4061600 4062880 It loves coke.
4064000 4065560 Which way did it go?
4065920 4067720 I'm not fucking around here.
4067800 4069200 Syd White.
4070560 4072720 Man, I've been following you<br />for years.
4072800 4074120 They all have.
4078720 4079720 Reba.
4081480 4083480 Oh, I always knew you were my girl.
4083800 4085040 I got you now.
4085360 4088480 Be careful when you cuff these guys.<br />They're kind of shifty.
4093080 4094080 What...
4095560 4096560 What are you doing?
4099400 4101760 - I'm sorry, Bob.<br />- I'm sorry, Bob.
4102480 4103560 You shot him?
4104040 4105240 I told you not to hurt him.
4105520 4106720 I don't work for you.
4106920 4108560 The department trusted you.
4109240 4111560 The state of Tennessee trusted you.
4111880 4116920 The United States of America,<br />it trusted you.
4117000 4119520 - I know.<br />- I trusted you with Rosette.
4119600 4120600 I know.
4121440 4122440 Who's Rosette?
4122520 4123560 The dog in my car.
4123640 4124720 You left a dog in the car?
4124800 4126600 You left my son in Saint Louis.
4127080 4128120 How is she?
4136440 4138040 She being a good girl?
4138120 4140400 Yeah. She's such a good girl.
4140840 4141840 En... Enough.
4141960 4143680 Tell me which way the bear went
4144120 4146360 or I'm gonna kill the dog<br />when I come down mountain.
4146440 4148880 Oh, no... please,<br />don't... don't do that.
4149080 4152200 I'd vote for not killing the dog<br />today, but that's just me.
4152800 4154000 Well, what do you guys say?
4155720 4156720 What's so funny?
4158960 4160560 Apex predator
4161160 4163880 high on cocaine,<br />and you're going towards it.
4170720 4172200 Dead north, man.
4173000 4174080 Yes, we will.
4174200 4177000 Dead... dead north.
4177560 4178560 Let's go!
4218600 4220840 The devil bear is in there.
4221080 4223200 You can't go in there.
4224120 4225360 Do you have kids?
4226040 4227160 We would have.
4227480 4228920 I have to go find mine.
4229000 4230920 And his name would be Texas.
4232200 4233560 - Do you have a flashlight?<br />- Yeah.
4238880 4239880 Here.
4240960 4242000 Thank you.
4242080 4244720 Bye, lady and little man.
4244800 4245880 Bye both.
4248080 4249080 Okay.
4249960 4251680 Wait. What about me?
4272320 4273600 Watch where you step.
4276120 4277880 I got you. Stay close.
4281000 4282000 What's that?
4287280 4288280 Don't move.
4288800 4290080 Stay still, Henry.
4296000 4297880 They look like polar bears.
4298160 4299160 Henry?
4300040 4301520 - Dee Dee?<br />- Mama!
4301600 4302856 Don't move. I'm gonna get you<br />out of here, okay?
4302880 4304040 No... Them, they're...
4304120 4305440 - they're harmless.<br />- Dee Dee!
4305520 4306640 - Mama, I just...<br />- Baby!
4308800 4310400 - Dee Dee, you're okay.<br />- Are you hurt?
4310480 4312120 - It's just my leg.<br />- Your leg?
4312200 4313280 That looks really deep.
4313360 4315400 - Here. Don't touch it.<br />- Ow...! Henry!
4315480 4316560 Let's keep you warm.
4317200 4318600 Oh, my gosh. You found my sweater.
4319120 4321040 You smart girl. You left us clues.
4321120 4322720 - Yeah.<br />- We found you.
4323320 4324320 Put that on.
4324520 4327120 - Mom, I'm so sorry.<br />- Oh, I love you so much.
4327760 4328760 Oh, my God.
4328840 4330760 - Mom, I'm so sorry...<br />- It's okay.
4330840 4332360 - I just...<br />- Henry told me everything.
4333120 4335040 - Everything?<br />- You mean that you guys did drugs?
4335120 4336560 - You told her?<br />- No.
4336640 4338400 I had a suspicion,<br />and you just confirmed it.
4338480 4340720 I'm just so glad I found you<br />and you're okay.
4342840 4344000 What was that?
4344840 4346120 Cocaine bear's back.
4347040 4348040 Can you walk?
4348520 4350080 - A little.<br />- Come on. Let's go, Henry.
4350800 4352200 Go that way. Go ahead.
4354400 4355560 It's okay. Come on.
4356680 4357880 Look. It's a way out.
4361400 4362480 It's the falls.
4362680 4363880 Oh, wow.
4373360 4375000 Henry, stay away from the ledge!
4375720 4376760 Oh, God.
4424400 4425480 This is it.
4428920 4430360 Syd, let's cut our losses.
4430960 4433320 All right? Let's just deal<br />with the fallout.
4433760 4435680 You saw what that bear did<br />to that hiker.
4440000 4441040 What is that?
4443160 4444680 - Oh, fuck!<br />- No!
4444760 4446360 - What the fuck? What the fuck?<br />- No!
4449000 4450000 Come on.
4455960 4456960 Eddie.
4457120 4458120 Take this.
4463680 4464680 Fuck.
4471200 4472200 Thank you.
4481640 4483280 Goddamn bear.
4484320 4485680 Eddie, put the rest in the bag.
4495240 4496480 You got what you wanted?
4496760 4497760 Let's go.
4501720 4503720 There's... there's a lot more<br />out there.
4504520 4506400 We got to keep looking, understand?
4509320 4510600 We're not whole yet.
4511360 4512360 I'm leaving, Syd.
4517040 4518040 Go.
4541480 4542640 Give me the bag.
4545040 4547000 When did you all get so soft?
4547560 4549880 All got sand in your pussies.
4552720 4555320 Mom! How are we gonna<br />get out of here?
4555840 4557320 It's a dead end. What do we do?
4557400 4558800 Stay away from the bears!
4561960 4563000 This way.
4564080 4565440 Come on. There's an opening.
4566080 4567120 Henry, come here.
4567520 4569400 Dee Dee, get in here.<br />Someone's coming.
4572920 4573920 He has a gun.
4578120 4579120 No!
4579640 4580640 Come on!

5015440 5016560 I've called backup.
5017440 5019560 Her name's Rosette.<br />She doesn't like fetch.
5020880 5022000 You should get going.
5022880 5024200 Take care of yourself.
5030200 5032760 Hi...
5034320 5035480 Rosette.
5047040 5048040 Whose dog is this?
5048320 5049400 I think it's mine.
5049960 5051200 Mine and Gabe's.
5051400 5052400 Is it on cocaine?
5052720 5053760 No.
5056040 5057240 That's a good dog.
5060080 5061880 So we just grab Gabe and go, right?
5061960 5063000 Yeah.
5067240 5070000 I knew you'd be okay.<br />You're the toughest person I know.
5071080 5072920 I think you get that from your mom.
5073840 5075000 I think you're right.
5075400 5076720 Thanks for coming to get me.

5093960 5096760 Don't look. Let's just cruise on by.
5097880 5099360 Oh, here come the po-po.
5100200 5102880 Hey, Mom. I want to go<br />to Nashville with you and Ray.

5109440 5111456 You know? We got the bite,<br />and we're about that life
5111480 5112600 Mrs. McKinndry.
5112880 5115120 Yeah, you're too grounded for rehab.
5131280 5133440 - Rodney, are you getting it?<br />- I swear to God, Carol.
5133760 5134880 Well, then zoom in.
5135720 5137640 - Is the red light on?<br />- No, I got it.

5241160 5242200 What's it eating?
5246520 5247520 Oh, my God.
5247720 5249200 They're weren't gonna<br />put 'em back on.
