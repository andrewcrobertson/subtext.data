134551 137428 You know<br />the first thing I thought
137429 139222 when I saw you?
140348 144227 I thought, "I want to make<br />a child with that person."
146312 148605 What if it's a her?
148606 150734 What would you call her?
151735 153861 Ragni, maybe.
153862 155446 Sorry?
155447 157072 Ragni.
157073 160367 Uh, let me think about<br />that for a second.
160368 162703 - Ragni.<br />- You hate it.
162704 164414 - Uh, boy's name?<br />- Texas.
165999 167666 You kidding me?
167667 170170 Texas is, like, a state,<br />you know? -I know.
171379 173213 There's about<br />three or four hours
173214 174548 till we reach the peak.
174549 176426 Ah, great.
182682 185392 Sweetie, can I just say<br />one last thing?
185393 187936 Then, I swear,<br />no more wedding talk.
187937 190397 - Of course.<br />- It's about the band.
190398 192983 But that is the one thing<br />you said I could handle myself,
192984 195569 and I've already made<br />my decision, Elsa.
195570 197613 Yeah, it's just that<br />I don't want
197614 199573 to use your brother's band.
199574 201158 - Why not?<br />- Honey...
201159 202618 He's super, super good.
202619 204578 - He works super hard.<br />- Yeah.
204579 206330 And-and he-he even takes<br />vocal lessons now.
206331 207915 Yeah, I know this.
207916 210709 I know this. It's just that,<br />um, well, Eric is no good.
210710 214379 I mean, he's, well,<br />terrible, actually.
214380 216841 His singing is like shit.
220303 223055 Hey. I mean, he has a nice b...
223056 224766 Olaf!
225558 227559 Olaf, I didn't mean to...<br />Oh, god.
227560 229144 Wait for me.
229145 231105 Why are you so sensitive?
236653 238613 Told you I could get us here.
245495 247412 It's beautiful.
247413 249373 Thank you. I love you.
261553 263053 Elsa.
263054 266099 - Look. Look.<br />- What is it? Hmm? Hmm?
267016 268476 - Look.
271062 273230 Quick, the camera.<br />Get the camera.
273231 276233 Oh, my, I've always wanted<br />to see a bear in real life.
276234 278902 First, humpbacks in Iceland,<br />and now this.
278903 281406 We have such good luck<br />in nature.
290665 292500 What do you see?
293918 295335 Hmm?
295336 298005 It's demented or something.
298006 299340 What?
302802 304553 Can I get the camera?<br />Give me the camera. -Yeah.
304554 306597 Demented?
306598 308140 I-I-I think we should leave it.
308141 310183 It's-it's something wrong<br />with it. Come on.
310184 311560 - Come on...<br />Ah!
311561 314022 Shh. Come on.<br />It's so cute.
315023 317524 Oh, there's nothing<br />to be afraid of, kristoffer.
317525 319944 I'm not afraid, Elsa.
320778 323406 Oh, sweetie, now, of course not.
326242 327702 Oh, fuck.
329621 331204 Don't panic.
331205 332372 What do we do?
332373 333916 "If it's black, fight back.
333917 335918 If it's brown, lay down."
335919 337586 But is it black or is it brown?
337587 338921 I mean, it looks brown to me.
338922 340714 We're in appalachia.<br />It's black.
340715 342424 - We have to fight it.<br />- How do you know?
342425 344469 You're not a bear expert.
345553 347095 Whatever you do, don't...
347096 349181 - Run! Where are we going?<br />- Oh-oh, no. Oh-oh, no.
349182 351102 - I said don't run! Stop! Stop!<br />- Uphill. Uphill.
352852 354561 Run!<br />- Where do we go?
354562 356939 - Run, Elsa! Run!<br />- Where do we go?
356940 359066 Oh, my god. Oh, my god!
359067 361276 - Run!
361277 363070 He's coming! Come on!
363071 364781 No! It's following...
371412 373205 Olaf! No!
373206 374457 God!
384717 386134 Help me!<br />- Come on! Come on!
386135 388096 Olaf!
411995 413663 This is drugs.
414998 417040 This is your brain on drugs.
417041 421712 It isn't glamorous<br />or cool or kid stuff.
421713 423964 The thrill can kill.
423965 428970 Smoking crack is like<br />putting a gun in your mouth...
430930 433182 And pulling the trigger.
436102 439229 Millions of dollars' worth of<br />cocaine dropped from the sky
439230 442315 early today onto a driveway<br />in Knoxville, Tennessee.
442316 444317 Kenley Jones reports tonight<br />it was found
444318 446820 on the body of a man<br />who fell to his death
446821 448823 when his parachute<br />failed to open.
450491 453410 The body of the heavily<br />armed parachutist was found
453411 456163 early this morning<br />by 85-year-old Fred Myers
456164 458165 and his neighbor, Ralph Johnson.
458166 460167 And you could see that<br />his main chute didn't open,
460168 462252 so I guess the loafers<br />was too much for him.
462253 465088 Police found more than<br />70 pounds of cocaine
465089 467174 wrapped in<br />football-size packages
467175 470219 in a duffel bag<br />the chutist was carrying.
475475 479645 Emergency chute deployed,<br />but didn't help much, I suppose.
480480 482689 Any narcotics found<br />with the plane wreckage?
482690 484357 Nothing.
484358 486485 Here's the I.D.
486486 488236 I know who that is.
488237 491782 Full name:<br />Andrew c. Thornton ii.
491783 494035 Man was out of his mind.
496579 498955 - What's the "c" stand for?<br />- Hmm?
498956 502210 You said "full name," but<br />you didn't say his full name.
506047 508215 Thornton was one of Syd<br />white's guys out of Missouri.
508216 511259 He's a known drug trafficker<br />with ties to Colombia.
511260 514221 Part of<br />the bluegrass conspiracy.
514222 518391 And there's more of this<br />out there.
518392 520436 They dumped it somewhere.
522980 524564 Hey, reba,<br />you have a dog, right?
524565 526399 Had.
526400 529111 Border collie. Barry.
529112 531530 Sorry for your loss.
531531 533532 Border collie, huh?
533533 535617 That's a cool dog.
535618 536952 Did he play fetch and stuff?
536953 538329 He loved fetch.
540248 541581 What?
541582 543542 Nothing. I just...
543543 546462 That's just awesome.
565565 566940 Damn it, Gabe.
566941 568693 Hi, daveed.
570611 573446 Uh, mind if I order first?
573447 575449 This won't take long.
580955 583708 Damn, I just bought these.
589088 591882 Hey, how's Gabe doing, anyway?
591883 594260 Did you hear about Thornton?
595011 596136 It's a tough way to go.
596137 598346 He only had 30 kilos on him.
598347 600308 Any idea where<br />we could find the rest?
601309 602809 Chattahoochee.
602810 604102 Georgia?
604103 605937 There's an area<br />called blood mountain.
605938 607814 When the plane's going down,
607815 609816 the pilots know<br />where to drop our load.
609817 611401 And then we just go and get it.
611402 614821 I don't need a bunch<br />of worried Colombians.
614822 616656 Now, I want you<br />to take Eddie with you.
616657 618033 Eddie's in mourning.
618034 619868 Joanie just died.
619869 621161 And he quit.
621162 623079 Joanie's the reason why he quit.
623080 624831 She's not here anymore.
624832 627000 The sooner he moves on,<br />the better.
627001 629211 Syd, I-I just don't...
629212 630420 Stop.
630421 633298 He won't even come<br />to get his goddamn son.
633299 636676 I am sick and tired<br />of watching my kid's kid.
636677 639096 Grandpa Syd, watch.
640181 642391 Yeah, that's great.
644393 647146 Got to go. Shift starts at 8:00.
648481 650816 Tomorrow's lunch is in<br />the fridge, and the chicken's...
652818 654402 Chicken's in the microwave.
654403 656280 Just hit "start."
657114 659199 Thought you were off tonight.
659200 660951 We talked about this, remember?
660952 662494 Me picking up some extra shifts?
662495 664037 You said you were okay with it.
664038 665747 I was okay with it<br />until I realized
665748 667707 why you want<br />those extra shifts...
667708 672046 So you could go and do overtime<br />with ray the pediatrician.
673589 676050 Gross, Dee Dee. Gross.
677218 679886 You know, he invited us<br />to go to Nashville
679887 681471 this weekend<br />to see his band play.
681472 684307 We were supposed to go paint<br />the waterfall this weekend.
684308 686184 I know, but it's gonna be fun.
686185 687727 We're gonna make<br />a whole weekend out of it.
687728 689646 It's Nashville.
689647 692358 He's a good guy, deirdra.
693442 694776 Just...
694777 696152 Give him a chance.
696153 698321 Please don't do that.
698322 699657 Do what?
701409 703410 You know what.
703411 706455 We'll paint the waterfall<br />another weekend, okay?
708582 711252 Close my door.
718426 720760 That's enough for today.
720761 722847 Wait, what?
723931 725850 Hey, Eddie.
726684 730229 They spelled her name wrong, daveed.
731689 733606 - It says "John."<br />- Oh.
733607 735942 - Says "John."<br />- Yeah.
735943 738111 - Her name is fucking Joan.<br />- Look, we...
738112 740280 - We could get it fixed.<br />- No.
740281 742282 I got to wait a week<br />for it to heal first.
742283 744451 I got seven more days of "John."
744452 746453 The chutist has been identified
746454 748246 as Andrew Thornton<br />of Paris, Kentucky.
748247 750582 - Wait, is that us?<br />- Hey.
750583 754419 Listen, Syd is worried<br />about you, all right?
754420 757006 Says you haven't seen Gabe<br />in weeks.
759008 761634 I'm so sad, man.
761635 764346 I'm so fucking sad.
764347 766182 Okay?
772104 774857 Can I get the, uh...<br />The penne, please?
776484 778651 Does it come with chicken,<br />or is it just, uh...
778652 780654 It's just plain.
792166 793917 I knew you'd be late.
793918 796127 It finally came in.<br />Check it out.
796128 798004 How many weeks' allowance<br />is that?
798005 800048 Like a thousand, but worth it.
800049 801883 - Can I use the toilet?<br />- Uh, no.
801884 803968 My mom is gonna be home soon.
803969 808139 And we got to go if we want<br />to get to the falls by lunch.
808140 810100 Why by lunch?
810101 811769 The light, Henry.
812895 814896 But I got to go pee.
814897 816314 Go outside.
816315 818191 Why do I skip school with you?
818192 820735 You're bossier than<br />the teachers.
820736 822320 Now, the adoption people...
822321 824489 I'm not sure who I talked to<br />over there...
824490 826699 Told me I was supposed to be<br />getting me a lab.
826700 830495 A fun one, a...<br />A man's-best-friend type.
830496 832205 I don't know<br />if there was an error,
832206 835041 because the one I got<br />is just kind of...
835042 836876 Bob?<br />- I don't know,
836877 838378 just kind of fancy.
838379 841089 Bob, captain says<br />it's time to go. -Got it.
841090 843592 Hey, look, I'm gonna<br />have to call you back.
844927 846469 Hey, reba.
846470 848722 You got plans for tonight?
849557 852350 Uh, Bob, you're a nice guy.
852351 855146 - I just don't...<br />- Mind looking after rosette?
856480 858064 - Oh.<br />- I have to go to Georgia
858065 859315 for the Thornton case,
859316 861025 and you said<br />you were good at dogs.
861026 862777 I said I had a dog.
862778 865572 You don't have jurisdiction<br />in Georgia.
865573 867282 A trucker overheard<br />a couple of guys
867283 868741 talking at a bar last night.
868742 871619 - I'll tell you in the car.<br />- No, no, no.
871620 873413 Pretty sure they're Syd's guys.
873414 876374 Oh, come on. You got to be<br />sort of good with them.
876375 878626 I only had her for a day.
878627 880170 Please?
880171 882756 Uh, I don't know if I could<br />trust anyone else around here.
885259 886593 Just go.
886594 888304 We'll be fine.
889096 890598 Thanks.
892641 894601 Can't believe<br />I left the backpack.
894602 896478 I can. I know the way.
896479 898313 School's gonna call, you know.
898314 900315 You know what? Let 'em.
900316 902775 And your mom's gonna be pissed.
902776 904319 So's your dad.
904320 906112 He doesn't care if I play hooky.
906113 907697 For a girl who likes<br />to be left alone,
907698 909449 you do a lot of shit<br />for attention.
909450 911117 Look, I'm not<br />ditching for attention.
911118 912452 I just want to paint<br />the waterfall.
912453 913786 Admit it.
913787 915789 You want her to find out<br />and worry about you.
946153 948447 - Jesus! Fuck!
949198 950573 Coral, it's sari.
950574 952200 Is Dee Dee over there?
952201 954160 School just called.
954161 955495 No.
955496 957831 Yeah, well, can you just<br />put Elliot on?
958874 960750 Yes, well, his daughter<br />just ditched school,
960751 963629 so can you please<br />just put him on?
965464 967674 Every time I call,<br />he's in the bathroom.
967675 970010 What the hell is wrong with him?
970928 972846 Never mind.

1024815 1027233 I'm not gonna see<br />that wrapper outside
1027234 1029068 - on the ground, now, am I?<br />- No, ma'am.
1029069 1031446 You one of those kids<br />caused me a bunch of shit?
1031447 1033615 - What?<br />- Empty your pockets.
1033616 1036076 Vest pocket. Come on.
1039913 1041331 Is that perfume?
1041332 1043207 That's none of your business.
1043208 1045543 Well, it smells really nice.
1045544 1048087 Yeah, well, it's European.
1048088 1049422 Oh.
1049423 1050965 Yeah, I'm expecting someone<br />in a minute.
1050966 1052884 Is it too much?
1052885 1053968 Not at all.
1053969 1055261 Smells expensive.
1055262 1058931 Well, it is.
1058932 1060767 You want a sucker?
1060768 1062644 Sure.
1062645 1063936 I like the green one.
1063937 1065605 This is a red one.
1065606 1068192 - Yes, ma'am.<br />- Uh-huh.
1069526 1071987 Oh, shit. He's here.
1082081 1084124 Am I in the right place?
1086627 1088628 Oh! Right.
1088629 1090296 Told you it was big.
1090297 1091965 Oh, it's big.
1092633 1094092 What's that smell?
1094093 1095469 It's European.
1098013 1100014 Someone been smoking?
1100015 1101641 Um, he was.
1101642 1102975 - Can you believe it?<br />- What?
1102976 1104310 You know,<br />cigarettes kill people.
1104311 1106062 - Yeah, but...<br />- And animals.
1106063 1109357 Forest fires are the number one<br />cause of death for wildlife.
1109358 1111484 Yeah, and y-you should be<br />educating yourself
1111485 1113653 instead of endangering<br />the entire ecosystem.
1113654 1115405 Just get out of here.
1115406 1117990 - Get out.
1117991 1120119 Unbelievable.
1121537 1123413 You got a dusty beaver here, ranger.
1123414 1125499 Yeah, well, I'm working on that.
1148063 1150606 Hey, Henry!
1150607 1153484 It looks like the deer<br />on this sign are doing it!
1153485 1155028 Hold on.
1156655 1159241 Seriously, what the hell<br />are you even doing?
1160242 1161659 Marking our territory.
1161660 1163536 Ugh! Don't shit out here!
1163537 1167207 I'm not shitting.
1169877 1172962 Hey. Did your mom pack<br />double lunch for school again?
1172963 1175548 My dad didn't have a chance<br />to make any.
1175549 1177217 Hey, Henry.
1187227 1189104 Check it out.
1192441 1194150 It's drugs, I think.
1194151 1195777 It's drugs?
1195778 1197945 Remember that guy from assembly?
1197946 1201073 He showed us pictures of stuff<br />that looked just like this.
1201074 1202992 Yeah. The guy from Vietnam<br />with no legs.
1202993 1204619 No.
1204620 1206913 This is definitely cocaine.
1206914 1208414 Yeah. Of course.
1208415 1211250 I'm just not used to<br />seeing it like that.
1211251 1215339 You know, it's usually<br />more powdery on the streets.
1216507 1218591 When have you seen cocaine<br />on the streets?
1218592 1219926 When I do it.
1219927 1221052 Oh, yeah?
1221053 1222136 With who?
1222137 1223596 With faulk.
1223597 1224931 After church.
1224932 1226933 Faulk does not do cocaine<br />after church.
1226934 1228559 Are you friends with faulk?
1228560 1229727 No. He's a pervert.
1229728 1231187 Then you wouldn't know.
1231188 1232438 Liar.
1232439 1234690 You're just mad<br />you're never invited.
1234691 1236734 I don't care I'm not invited.
1236735 1238987 Sounds like you care.
1239947 1241782 Do some, then.
1243367 1245076 What?
1245077 1247203 You've done it before.<br />You can do it again.
1247204 1251123 Well, uh, we're exercising,<br />though. Shooting and stuff.
1251124 1254252 I mean, I can't do cocaine<br />while shooting and exercising.
1254253 1255837 That wouldn't be good.
1255838 1257129 Fine.
1257130 1258632 Knife me.
1267140 1270102 Okay, so how do I do it?
1271061 1272271 You eat it.
1273230 1274313 How much?
1274314 1276984 Like a tablespoon's worth.
1288078 1289620 Oh!
1289621 1292582 - Son of a bitch!
1292583 1295669 Oh, what the hell?
1296545 1298422 - Rookie.
1300424 1302091 You do it, then.
1302092 1303969 Ugh.
1317274 1320192 - Ah, shit!
1320193 1322028 What the hell?
1322029 1324406 This isn't as good<br />as the shit I normally do.
1327034 1329328 Ugh!
1330704 1333039 How much do you think<br />this stuff is worth?
1333040 1334999 Let's sell drugs together.
1335000 1338336 Yeah, we could sell them on<br />the street like you and faulk.
1338337 1341048 There's more.
1343216 1344551 Ow.
1346219 1349221 Something got into it.
1349222 1350681 A deer, maybe.
1350682 1352892 Could you imagine that?<br />Deer on cocaine?
1352893 1354393 It'd be like this.
1354394 1357188 Yeah, it'd be, like,<br />going into trees like... bang!
1357189 1358940 - Bang!<br />- Yep, and then it'd get stuck.
1358941 1361400 Yeah, and then it'd be so sad.
1361401 1364570 Hey, Dee Dee. Do you think<br />my dad has ever done cocaine?
1364571 1367532 Your dad has definitely<br />done cocaine.
1370202 1372079 My throat's really runny.
1375082 1377167 Stop that.
1389429 1391931 Did it do the cocaine?
1391932 1394768 Don't move a muscle.
1400983 1402525 Listen to me.
1402526 1405778 You were supposed to grab Eddie,<br />not run your mouth.
1405779 1407905 Now we have trouble.<br />You understand? -Got it.
1407906 1410074 - I'll take care of it.
1410075 1412243 Gabe, knock that off. Gabe.
1412244 1414578 Grandpa Syd!<br />Gabe, driving me nuts.
1414579 1416122 Little...
1416123 1418041 Fuck.

1446028 1448280 Joan loved this song.
1449823 1453410 She said he sang with the soul<br />of a thousand-year-old man.
1457581 1459582 Um, Eddie, listen.
1459583 1463836 Uh, when joanie died,
1463837 1466465 I'm sorry I didn't, you know...
1467841 1469383 It's fine.
1469384 1471218 No, I could've did more.
1471219 1472344 It's fine.
1472345 1473429 I should've been there.
1473430 1474764 I didn't need you there.
1474765 1476098 I don't hang out<br />with drug dealers anymore.
1476099 1477683 It's against my constitution.
1477684 1479643 I'm more than a drug dealer.
1479644 1481937 - No, you're not.<br />- Come on, Eddie.
1481938 1483397 We're friends, right?
1483398 1484482 No.
1484483 1486401 Fine.
1487611 1489737 I think he's happy she's dead.
1489738 1491197 He's not happy she died.
1491198 1493699 Blamed her for me leaving<br />the family business,
1493700 1496535 if we can call it that.
1496536 1498329 Sometimes...
1498330 1500706 - I wonder if he did it to her.<br />- What?
1500707 1502458 No, joanie died of cancer.
1502459 1503709 I know.
1503710 1505795 Maybe he gave her the cancer.
1505796 1507213 You can't give no one cancer.
1507214 1508881 Yes, you can. With stress.
1508882 1510925 Stop protecting him.
1510926 1512843 You know what?<br />Maybe I should turn this off.

1536618 1538786 I'm wearing the stuff.
1538787 1541455 Oh. Did either of you<br />see a girl,
1541456 1543290 13, come through here?<br />My daughter...
1543291 1545334 You lost your daughter<br />in the park.
1545335 1547962 Well, she came here on her own,<br />heading to the waterfall.
1547963 1551048 Yeah. Hikers under 16 must be<br />accompanied by an adult.
1551049 1552883 Well, I didn't know<br />she was coming here.
1552884 1554510 You know, we get<br />a lot of runaways,
1554511 1556971 bad apples,<br />youngsters who aren't too happy
1556972 1558514 with the way things are at home.
1558515 1559849 She's not a runaway.
1559850 1561267 She just came to paint the...
1561268 1562768 Can someone just please point me
1562769 1564103 in the direction<br />of blood mountain?
1564104 1566147 This is blood mountain.
1566148 1567481 - Sorry. I-I'm Peter.<br />Oh.
1567482 1569066 This is Peter,<br />wildlife inspection rep.
1569067 1571944 We're about to head up there ourselves.
1571945 1573362 Oh. Do you mind if I tag along?
1573363 1574905 Now, Peter,<br />the wildlife inspection
1574906 1576282 is a very important process.
1576283 1577825 We wouldn't want you distracted
1577826 1579785 by our little<br />damsel in distress here.
1579786 1581328 Nothing can distract me
1581329 1583956 from making sure<br />the entire biological community
1583957 1585749 is safe for all our friends.
1585750 1587376 Friends?
1587377 1589336 - He means animals.<br />- I don't like that word.
1589337 1591797 He doesn't like<br />to call them animals.
1591798 1594217 Well, I won't be a burden.
1595969 1597971 I'll get my hat.
1599014 1600473 Okay.
1604769 1606353 Shoes okay for hiking?
1606354 1608272 Oh, yeah.<br />I-I think I'll be okay.
1608273 1610149 I have on boots.<br />- Yep.
1610150 1611817 Come on, Eddie.
1611818 1613527 I'm done playing this game.
1613528 1614778 You-you wanted...
1614779 1616363 You were the one<br />who wanted to play this.
1616364 1618324 You still have<br />three more questions.
1618325 1620493 Listen.<br />What?
1622204 1623746 I'm tired of playing<br />this fucking game.
1623747 1625497 No, you're not.<br />You just don't want to lose.
1625498 1628335 I'm-a go in here<br />and take a piss, all right?
1633089 1635925 I didn't know<br />rangers carried guns.
1635926 1638344 Park rangers are peace officers.
1638345 1640679 Which means we can shoot people.
1640680 1643140 Forest is a dangerous place.
1643141 1645392 That gang of pubes<br />are dangerous.
1645393 1646769 "Gang of pubes"?
1646770 1648146 Teens. Delinquents.
1650273 1652691 They've been attacking hikers.
1652692 1654193 They hurt anyone?
1654194 1656488 They cut them with a knife.
1657656 1659865 Call themselves the doochamps.
1659866 1661743 Watch your back.
1662869 1665371 Pop-art punks<br />pop up out of nowhere.
1665372 1667749 Out of nowhere.
1681012 1682681 Fuck is this?
1684057 1686767 He's afraid, buds.
1686768 1688560 Empty your pockets.
1688561 1689979 No.
1689980 1692565 Empty your pockets, please.
1694234 1697070 Since you asked so nicely.
1699114 1701865 You think this is a joke?
1701866 1703450 I do.
1703451 1705244 Get him, buds.
1705245 1706912 I'm shaking<br />a fucking knife, man. Come on.
1706913 1708747 Just stab him. -Come on, man.<br />It's a fucking knife!
1708748 1710333 - Go on!
1713378 1715254 Oh!
1715255 1716755 Come on, rocky. Come on, rocky.
1716756 1718341 - Come on, rocky.<br />- Ah! Banzai!
1720385 1722595 Give me this fucking board!
1724264 1726099 You're going down, man!
1732981 1734857 Submit! Submit!
1734858 1736276 What the...
1739112 1740779 Hold this!
1740780 1743241 Aah! Fucking skateboard!
1755628 1757088 Oh, my.
1770977 1773020 The fuck is wrong with y'all?!
1773021 1774647 Shit!
1775648 1777149 I love this road.
1777150 1778692 Ah, love it up there.
1778693 1780819 So, wait, where is it<br />that you wanted to go again?
1780820 1782321 What? The falls.
1782322 1783697 The secret falls. Right, well,<br />we can go up this way
1783698 1785324 - or take the loop.<br />I love the loop.
1785325 1787034 Well, you can see<br />the top of the...
1787035 1788994 This is a more direct...
1788995 1790871 All right. We're going this way.
1790872 1792539 Well, crap.
1792540 1795125 Told you she shouldn't<br />have come with us.
1795126 1797211 Just distracting you completely.
1797212 1798712 She can hear you.
1798713 1801299 I wanted to get up<br />to see the sunset.
1802550 1804843 - What's taking you so long?
1804844 1806805 What'd you do?
1816689 1819149 Please tell me<br />you found them like this.
1819150 1820192 They attacked me.
1820193 1821360 Are they dead?
1821361 1822736 Well, one might be.
1822737 1825240 The-the one that stabbed me<br />might be dead.
1827242 1830327 Jesus chr... they're kids.
1830328 1832663 I loved this fucking Jersey, man.
1832664 1834123 Okay, they're fine.
1834124 1836250 Thank god.
1836251 1837877 No fucking way.
1839921 1841214 Daveed?
1848847 1850055 What happened?
1850056 1851140 Hey.
1851141 1852391 - Wake up.
1852392 1853934 Where'd you find this?
1853935 1855394 Whoa.
1855395 1858021 Where is this energy<br />coming from, bud?
1858022 1859565 You tried to fucking kill me.
1859566 1862025 You got a foul mouth there, bud.
1862026 1864194 I tell him that all the time.
1864195 1866113 Where did you find this?
1866114 1867906 Up on the mountain.
1867907 1868991 Where's the rest of it?
1868992 1870868 I don't know.
1870869 1874538 Listen, I just took out<br />the three of you in 15 seconds.
1874539 1876081 What do you think I'll do<br />to just you
1876082 1878292 when you're already<br />on the floor?
1878293 1880335 Okay. Okay.
1880336 1883088 We stashed it under a gazebo.
1883089 1884965 Going back for it later tonight.
1884966 1886925 A gazebo?
1886926 1890095 It's a pavilion-type structure.
1890096 1891889 I know what the fuck<br />a gazebo is.
1891890 1893725 I didn't.
1894767 1896602 Are my buds dead?
1896603 1898270 - Show us where.<br />- Oh, god.
1898271 1900439 You know,<br />i-I'm feeling kind of tired.
1900440 1901940 I think I should rest.
1901941 1903942 Okay. Want a dirt nap?
1903943 1905360 Eddie, go get the gun.
1905361 1906778 It's in the glove.
1906779 1908113 I prefer we left guns<br />out of this.
1908114 1910073 Yeah. Same.
1910074 1913118 And I would prefer<br />not to be stabbed.
1913119 1915996 So, Eddie, please go get<br />the fucking gun.
1915997 1917790 Okay.
1918875 1920292 Okay.
1920293 1921460 All right, all right.
1921461 1923463 All right, I'm coming.
1924214 1925548 Relax.
1934390 1936476 It's getting real cold out.
1951449 1954035 Let's go.
1956496 1958163 So, where you guys from?
1958164 1959873 Shut up. Keep walking.
1959874 1962501 Gonna be a long hike<br />if we can't talk to each other.
1962502 1964503 It better not be a long hike.
1964504 1965837 Friend's<br />pretty serious, ain't he?
1965838 1967506 Well, I don't think<br />he's too happy
1967507 1969174 after getting stabbed<br />in the shoulder.
1969175 1971009 Well, it wasn't me.
1971010 1972511 Eh, I don't blame him, though.
1972512 1974012 Getting stabbed sucks.

1991698 1993574 Yeah, reba, it's Bob.
1993575 1996451 I was wondering<br />how rosette is doing.
1996452 1998745 Realized I hadn't said<br />a proper goodbye.
1998746 2000330 I...
2000331 2004043 I don't know if dogs think about<br />that sort of thing, but, uh...
2005295 2007797 Anyway, I...
2009716 2011758 Thanks again for helping out.
2011759 2013386 Bye.
2015430 2017014 Look at this.
2017015 2018390 Oh, no.
2018391 2020642 Look at this mess.
2020643 2022686 People don't have any respect.
2022687 2024646 This is gonna end up<br />in scat, this plastic.
2024647 2025939 I... let me pick that up.
2025940 2028233 - All right. Thank you, ranger.<br />- Dee Dee!
2028234 2030193 That is sticking.<br />- I got some oil in the car.
2030194 2031403 Dee Dee! Henry!
2031404 2032904 'Cause if that stays open,
2032905 2034740 - critters can get in there.<br />- Oh, yeah, critters.
2034741 2036825 What kind of critters? Huh?
2036826 2038452 - Squirrels?<br />- Squirrels could get in there.
2038453 2040662 Chipmunks?<br />- Yeah, chipmunks get in there.
2040663 2042289 - Dee Dee!<br />Uh, skunks.
2042290 2043749 Raccoon, you know,<br />little burglar.
2043750 2045584 - That's right.<br />- Got his own little mask on.
2045585 2046585 Yeah, with their cute little<br />outfit. -I think they're cute.
2046586 2048045 Uh, skunks.
2048046 2049212 Skunks. Hmm.
2049213 2050339 - Possums.<br />Possums.
2050340 2051506 - Definitely possums.<br />- Possum.
2051507 2053592 - Uh...<br />- Hey, possum.
2053593 2055761 Mrs. Mckinndry!
2055762 2057137 Henry?
2057138 2058930 Here! Hello?
2058931 2060182 Henry?
2060183 2061768 Up here!
2063603 2065771 Hey. Whoa.<br />Oh.
2065772 2067731 Henry, what are you<br />doing up there?
2067732 2068815 No.
2068816 2070609 - No, that's not safe at all.<br />No.
2070610 2072778 It's too high.<br />You got to come down.
2072779 2073862 Get down here.
2073863 2076657 Don't be mad,<br />but we skipped school.
2076658 2078492 - No shit, Henry.<br />It's high.
2078493 2080035 But there was a bear.
2080036 2081370 A really terrible bear.
2081371 2082829 - A bear?<br />- Yeah, I know.
2082830 2084956 - It was fucked!<br />Hey!
2084957 2086750 That's inappropriate.
2086751 2090128 Sorry for cussing,<br />but it attacked me and Dee Dee.
2090129 2091588 It attacked you?
2091589 2093590 - Henry, where is Dee Dee?<br />No, no.
2093591 2095592 Bears are<br />very peaceful creatures.
2095593 2097302 You must have done something<br />to upset it.
2097303 2099262 - Yeah, did you feed it?<br />- What did you do?
2099263 2101348 Nothing! Y'all need to hide!
2101349 2104184 I'm telling you,<br />it's not just any bear!
2104185 2106228 You have to listen to me!
2106229 2108105 Henry, where is Dee Dee?
2108106 2109648 The monster took her.
2109649 2112984 Now, I'm not gonna<br />tell you again, little girl.
2112985 2114611 Get down here now.
2114612 2117155 - A...
2117156 2119282 - I...
2119283 2120993 Dee Dee!
2138010 2140054 Whoa!
2142014 2143306 Peter!
2143307 2145184 - No!<br />- Peter!
2149397 2151565 Oh! Oh, no!
2151566 2153400 It let me go! He ran off!
2153401 2156611 - Henry, jump down.<br />- It's too high.
2156612 2158071 Is it gone?
2158072 2159991 Do you see it?
2167415 2168790 Yeah.
2168791 2171084 Why are you shooting at me?
2171085 2172294 Get your ass down!
2172295 2173712 This is your fault.
2173713 2175256 Right behind you. I saw it.
2176466 2177717 Stay down.
2186434 2188561 What?
2206162 2207663 Help me!
2208456 2210333 Help!
2214629 2217422 Ranger! Ranger!
2217423 2218799 Did it get you?
2218800 2221343 That asshole!
2221344 2222636 I'm gonna get him.
2222637 2224180 I'm gonna get that asshole.
2227475 2228767 I'll get help.
2228768 2230268 Where are you going?
2230269 2231603 God almighty.
2231604 2233773 Hey. What...
2235274 2236776 Where is it?
2238361 2239987 Hey!
2242406 2244199 What should I do?
2244200 2245700 Motherfucker!
2245701 2247119 Come back! Help us!
2249413 2251373 Oh, fuck!
2256546 2257963 There's something wrong with it.
2257964 2259548 Yeah, I told you there was.
2259549 2261758 Why is it acting like this?
2261759 2263802 Did you feed it cocaine?
2263803 2266179 No. But you're safe.
2266180 2268139 Bears can't climb trees.
2268140 2269432 Of course they can!
2269433 2271394 Then why are you up here?
2296878 2299839 It's okay. It's okay.
2317148 2318900 Okay.
2335124 2336375 No.
2338794 2341630 Henry, climb. Henry, go.
2341631 2344049 Climb! Climb!<br />You got to get higher!
2344050 2345592 - Climb.<br />Go, Henry!
2345593 2346885 Go!
2346886 2349013 - Henry, move!<br />- Go higher!
2351557 2352891 Go up!
2352892 2354976 Henry, go!
2354977 2356854 Oh, god.
2358648 2360357 Go, Henry! No!<br />- Whoa!
2360358 2361566 No!
2361567 2363611 Oh, god. Henry!
2378542 2380503 Oh, god.
2382213 2384006 Oh, shit.
2387551 2389720 No, no, no, no!
2392264 2394849 Get off of me! No, no!
2394850 2397186 - Get off! Get off of me!
2403359 2405402 Henry, jump! Jump down!
2405403 2407488 - Move, Henry!
2413953 2416204 It's okay. It's okay.<br />You're doing great.
2416205 2418790 You're almost there.<br />Come on, baby.
2418791 2421126 - Come on. Let's go.
2421127 2423087 Come on.
2441772 2444275 Go. Hide. Come here. Come here.
2448946 2450948 That was so messed up.
2451824 2454367 That little man<br />was an expert on bears
2454368 2457328 but didn't know the bear<br />was the cocaine bear.
2457329 2459039 Wait. What did you say?
2459040 2460498 We found cocaine,<br />Mrs. Mckinndry.
2460499 2462333 There was cocaine in the forest,<br />and the bear ate it
2462334 2464836 and then went crazy<br />on me and Dee Dee
2464837 2467338 and now on that guy back there.
2467339 2469215 Did you hear him scream?
2469216 2471468 He's so dead.
2471469 2473970 I'd love to not remember that.
2473971 2475972 But it kind of seems like
2475973 2478517 the thing that stays<br />with a man forever.
2479477 2482687 Henry, when the bear<br />took Dee Dee, was she...
2482688 2484689 Alive? Yeah.
2484690 2486358 It chased her that way.
2487359 2489195 We got to go. Let's go.
2491864 2493531 He get at you, too?
2493532 2496367 - Fucking beast.<br />- Yeah, you can say that again.
2496368 2499163 - Call an ambulance.<br />- I already did.
2501415 2502957 Keep him awake.
2502958 2505419 Yeah, I've been trying.
2520768 2522936 You piles of shit!
2522937 2525522 - You're the doochamps!<br />- Hey, that's-that's not ours.
2525523 2527191 We found it.
2529860 2532113 "It's not ours."
2532988 2534572 I'm a park ranger.
2534573 2536741 - I'm not dumb.<br />- I know.
2536742 2538409 They say I can't keep<br />my park safe,
2538410 2540912 that I'm unfit<br />for the big leagues.
2540913 2542831 I'd have been<br />at yellowstone by now
2542832 2543915 if it weren't for you shits!
2543916 2545416 - Buds.<br />Huh?
2545417 2548294 There's someone outside.
2548295 2551089 It's him. Get to the door.<br />Get to the door.
2551090 2552298 - Yeah.
2552299 2556219 Now, uh, open it<br />when I-I count to three.
2556220 2558221 Wait, wait.<br />But you're gonna shoot him?
2558222 2559722 Hell yes, I'm gonna shoot him!
2559723 2561141 He took a bite out of my ass!
2561142 2563561 What the fuck is wrong<br />with this guy?
2564979 2567273 Now, open it when I say so.
2569608 2571110 Now.
2573779 2575990 That's a fucking bear.
2581829 2583998 What the fuck?!
2591797 2592964 I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.
2592965 2594299 - You're sorry?<br />- I'm sorry.
2594300 2596718 - Where'd the bear go?<br />- You killed him.
2596719 2597802 Where's the bear?!
2597803 2599554 - I don't know!<br />- Close the door!
2599555 2603349 - Close the motherfucking door.<br />- Jesus Christ.
2603350 2605603 Close the door.
2606854 2609690 Oh, god. I'm sorry, bud.
2615487 2618616 Keep your mouth shut.<br />Check over there.
2641347 2643766 Shh.
2646936 2648895 He's up there.
2648896 2650356 He's up there.
2680594 2684181 I got it. I got it.
2694358 2696067 Maybe the kid can help you.
2696068 2698236 Look, I'm done<br />playing this game.
2698237 2700071 - What game?<br />- 20 questions.
2700072 2702573 Daveed's so fucking cold.<br />It's unbelievable.
2702574 2705076 - What did he ask so far?<br />- He just keeps guessing.
2705077 2707203 Like, "is it a spider?
2707204 2709247 - Is it an arrow?"
2709248 2711625 What are you, new?
2712626 2714627 Hey, start broad,<br />then narrow it down.
2714628 2715920 Everybody knows that.
2715921 2717714 Look, are we close<br />to the gazebo?
2717715 2719299 Is that one of your questions?
2719300 2721009 Oh, is it bigger<br />than a bread box?
2721010 2723262 No, no, no. Daveed needs to ask.
2724138 2726598 Ask him if it's bigger<br />than a bread box.
2727766 2730311 Is it bigger than a bread box?
2731603 2732770 - Yes.<br />- Whoo!
2732771 2734105 Yeah!
2734106 2735898 Is it Abraham Lincoln?
2735899 2738067 What? No.
2738068 2741279 Broad, then narrow it down, man.
2741280 2743449 You have one question left.
2799129 2802215 Dee Dee! Dee Dee!
2802216 2803841 You sure this is the way?
2803842 2805928 Pretty sure.
2811225 2813017 Dee Dee! It's okay.
2813018 2814686 It's mama.
2816021 2818190 Oh.
2819024 2820900 Thank god.
2820901 2822860 - Ew! What the heck?
2822861 2825154 It's paint. It's just red paint.
2825155 2827698 It looks a lot like blood.<br />How can you be sure?
2827699 2829659 I'm a nurse, Henry.
2829660 2831370 Good point.
2832454 2834248 Come on.
2838585 2840546 Oh, smart girl.
2842548 2844799 Henry, come on.<br />She left us a trail.
2844800 2848052 Mrs. Mckinndry,<br />have you ever done cocaine?
2848053 2849720 What?
2849721 2851889 Why do you ask?
2851890 2854392 Just wondering if it has<br />long-term side effects...
2854393 2857645 For the bear, of course,<br />if it just did a little bit.
2857646 2861065 Well, it could create<br />a habit for the bear.
2861066 2863568 What if they never want<br />to do it again?
2863569 2866237 Oh, then it-it should be fine.
2866238 2869115 But mama bear and papa bear<br />would be very angry
2869116 2871367 because drugs...<br />Especially cocaine...
2871368 2873536 Are very, very bad.
2873537 2875288 What if they would<br />never find out?
2875289 2876914 Oh, Henry.
2876915 2879125 We always find out.
2879126 2881002 Dee Dee!

2956870 2958539 Yeah. Obviously.

3239027 3241946 I don't know<br />how to talk to him, you know.
3241947 3246159 Like, what-what do you say to<br />a kid who just lost his mommy?
3247202 3250454 My mom is the reason<br />I'm the man I am today.
3250455 3251956 And what a man you are.
3251957 3254041 Attacking innocent people<br />for no reason.
3254042 3255292 Can you not?
3255293 3257461 I'm sorry. Just continue.
3257462 3259463 Well, when my daddy died,
3259464 3261799 my mama bought me<br />this pet lizard.
3261800 3263759 It was the coolest little thing.
3263760 3265928 It had all these<br />green scales on it.
3265929 3268347 She used to call it<br />a tiny dinosaur.
3268348 3270015 I thought that was so awesome.
3270016 3272726 I was real bad<br />at connecting with people,
3272727 3274436 but I practiced<br />conversation starters
3274437 3276230 on that lizard every day.
3276231 3279401 And then<br />that's how I met rocky and Joe.
3280819 3282319 That's my team, man.
3282320 3285740 We're planning on moving<br />to New York City together.
3286491 3289660 Those are my buds, man.
3289661 3292288 So I should get Gabe a lizard?
3292289 3294999 Well, you know what?
3295000 3298669 Lizards are good listeners, bud,
3298670 3300713 but people...
3300714 3303300 People are good at hearing.
3307137 3310514 That's the sweetest thing<br />I ever heard. Thank you.
3310515 3312141 - Can we...<br />- It's okay.
3312142 3314268 Y'all are hugging.
3314269 3316730 It's okay.
3319524 3321443 Where the fuck is the gazebo?
3394975 3398812 Can I say something without you<br />getting angry with me?
3399938 3402273 I'm already angry with you.
3405610 3407445 It's gone.
3408405 3409780 What the actual...
3409781 3411281 - No! Please, please!<br />- Daveed, stop.
3411282 3412825 No, no, no. The kid's<br />messing with us, Eddie.
3412826 3414201 No, no, no! I'm not!<br />I'm not! I'm not!
3414202 3415869 I-I promise.<br />I-I don't know where it went.
3415870 3417246 It's just gone.
3417247 3419415 Okay, well,<br />duffel bags don't have legs.
3419416 3421625 Since you're the only one<br />that knew where it was,
3421626 3423877 i'm-a give you one more chance.
3423878 3425504 Where's the ba...
3425505 3428466 Put the gun down<br />and move away from the teenager.
3430093 3434805 Drop the weapon and step away<br />about five to ten paces.
3434806 3437391 All right, listen.<br />Just calm down, all right?
3437392 3438810 I ain't fucking around.
3439561 3441980 Just do it.
3443648 3445316 Fuck.
3446192 3448402 - You don't want to do this.<br />- Shut up!
3448403 3451072 I'm coming down there.
3457829 3459998 Uh...
3462417 3466212 Uh...
3467839 3470549 - Uh...
3470550 3471509 Shh!
3471510 3473510 I'm just trying to...
3473511 3475637 Find a safe spot to hop down.
3475638 3477347 How did you get up there?
3477348 3479683 Well, I jumped from that tree<br />over there, but...
3479684 3481185 I hurt my hip a little.
3481186 3482895 I can try to catch you<br />if you want.
3482896 3486483 No, no!<br />You stay right where you are!
3487692 3489526 Let's, uh, see, uh...
3489527 3490820 Get it.
3492822 3495324 Fuck!
3495325 3496701 Fuck!
3498078 3499703 Well, you brought that<br />on yourself, kid.
3499704 3502539 Oh, yeah?<br />I shot my own fucking fingers?
3502540 3504083 I told you not to move.
3504084 3507169 How'd he take<br />those two fingers off?
3507170 3509214 They're not even<br />next to each other.
3510882 3512550 Fuck you!
3513843 3515385 Come out of there!
3515386 3516970 Shit! Come on out!
3516971 3518890 No fucking way!
3520517 3522268 God! Goddamn it!
3523561 3525562 You two, on your bellies.
3525563 3527607 Now! And no more moving.
3528900 3530692 Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!
3530693 3531985 Can you grab them for me?
3531986 3533403 Can I grab his fingers?
3533404 3535073 Okay. Get 'em. Get 'em.
3536282 3538118 Slow. Slow.
3540912 3542079 Easy.
3542080 3543623 Ugh, god.
3545375 3547084 All right.
3547085 3548710 Now, you get back on your belly.
3548711 3550588 I'll hold on to these.
3556636 3558304 Now, where you at?
3559681 3561432 Shit.
3562767 3563976 What?
3563977 3565520 Oh, no. The river.
3567730 3569606 Henry, look.
3569607 3571608 That's Dee Dee's sweater.
3571609 3573902 - Come on.<br />- So we're crossing?
3573903 3575696 We're on the right track.
3575697 3577407 I can feel it.
3593464 3595466 Mama?
3596634 3598844 Fuck.
3598845 3600679 Fuck, man.
3600680 3603141 My fucking Jersey, man.
3605185 3607311 How long are you gonna<br />keep us like this?
3607312 3608979 Until that guy in the gazebo
3608980 3610731 throws his weapon<br />into the woods.
3610732 3612691 Well, then we'll be here forever.
3612692 3615194 Hasn't Syd already<br />messed your life up enough?
3615195 3617070 We don't need to die<br />because of this.
3617071 3619072 Eddie, I got this.
3619073 3620324 Do you?
3620325 3623160 I have your fingers<br />in my pocket.
3623161 3624828 You're all gonna get arrested.
3624829 3627122 Drug sentences since Nixon<br />are fucked,
3627123 3629875 so get ready for ten to 15 years
3629876 3631960 of shitting<br />in front of your cellmate
3631961 3633670 and supervised shower time.
3633671 3636173 Detective, your honor, sir,<br />I'm not with them.
3636174 3637925 I've never even done coke.
3637926 3641011 I mean, maybe once.<br />Once... at a party once.
3641012 3643180 - I can't go to jail.<br />- You're not going to jail.
3643181 3644723 Just saying, I can't shit<br />in front of people.
3644724 3646683 I've never been able to shit<br />in front of people.
3646684 3648603 I like to shit in peace.
3654025 3656319 Nobody move.
3657779 3659071 It's a bear.
3659072 3660739 Yeah.
3660740 3662491 No, no.
3662492 3665370 I'm not falling<br />for none of your...
3688059 3689476 Oh, fuck.
3689477 3691728 Hey, y'all just stay still.<br />Don't move.
3691729 3693106 Just play dead.
3719090 3720591 Shh.
3747368 3748453 Oh, fuck.
3757628 3758795 Oh, man. You fucked.
3758796 3759921 Eddie, can you breathe?
3759922 3761882 What the fuck?
3761883 3763468 I think that's a yes.
3764302 3766053 Can someone do something?
3766054 3767471 Maybe your boy can do something.
3767472 3771308 Can you just, like... move it?
3771309 3774228 Oh, of course.<br />Why didn't I think of that?
3777940 3779524 Dee Dee!
3779525 3782653 Henry, stay close.<br />I haven't seen paint in a while.
3784989 3786656 Oh, god.
3786657 3788617 Look.
3788618 3790370 Hello.
3791704 3795123 - Is he okay?
3795124 3798001 Help me, please.
3798002 3799961 Does he have food?
3799962 3802339 Her name was Elsa,
3802340 3804759 and she was so beautiful.
3806094 3807928 Are-are you... are you hurt?
3807929 3810180 Were you attacked?
3810181 3811933 Devil bear.
3812892 3814142 My... I'm looking<br />for my daughter.
3814143 3815352 She was attacked<br />by the devil bear.
3815353 3816561 Have you seen her?
3816562 3818105 You have?
3818106 3820315 - Was she alive?<br />Yes.
3820316 3821858 Please, can you just point<br />to where she went?
3821859 3823777 Please, can you show me?<br />I'm looking for her.
3823778 3824820 I haven't...
3824821 3826364 Henry!
3838835 3842547 I'll show you. Come.
3847885 3849804 It's not moving.
3851180 3853140 I think it died.
3853141 3855225 It died on top of me?
3855226 3856476 Check its pulse.
3856477 3859062 Can you, like,<br />feel it breathing?
3859063 3861399 I'm not sure.
3862984 3865569 Uh, hey, guy?
3865570 3866695 Detective.
3866696 3867737 Can we call a truce
3867738 3869739 so I can see<br />if the bear is dead?
3869740 3870950 Yeah.
3875580 3876706 Fuck.
3881252 3883170 You okay?
3883171 3885423 What do you think?
3902815 3904608 S-Still breathing.
3904609 3906943 We should go.
3906944 3909321 He'll probably be all right.
3909322 3911406 What the hell, man?
3911407 3912782 He's gonna wake up eventually.
3912783 3914826 Well, that's exactly<br />what I'm afraid of.
3914827 3916119 "She."
3916120 3917454 What?
3917455 3919289 The bear is a girl.
3919290 3920832 Oh, yeah.<br />H-How do you know that?
3920833 3923920 Because its vagina is on my ear.
3926088 3927839 Oh, shit. She's moving.
3927840 3929257 She's awake.
3929258 3931635 Oh, shit.<br />Well, stay back. Stay back.
3931636 3934305 Okay.
3939185 3940185 Chill out. Just chill out!
3940186 3942145 Ooh. Homes, hey, hey.
3942146 3943856 - Stay back.
3947985 3949486 What the hell?
3949487 3952323 Okay. Okay.
3954867 3957495 No, no, no, no.<br />Don't eat that. Don't eat that.
3958204 3960163 I will be goddamned.
3960164 3961665 Should we shoot her?
3961666 3965127 No. Let's see what kind<br />of effect that has on it.
3966671 3969006 What the fuck?
3981686 3984354 - No, no, no, no, no, no!
3984355 3986273 - Eddie!<br />Daveed, help.
3986274 3988900 What is this?
3988901 3990360 - No, no.
3990361 3992112 - Ooh! Okay, I have...<br />What is it doing?
3992113 3993863 I-I don't like this.
3993864 3995282 Please stop.
3995283 3997368 - Just go limp! Slide down!<br />- I'm limp already.
3999120 4001329 - Shoot the bear! Shoot her!<br />Don't shoot!
4001330 4003498 No, no. Don't shoot.<br />Don't shoot.
4003499 4004624 Eddie, you got to fight back,<br />all right?
4004625 4005709 It's-it's playing with you.
4005710 4007210 I'd stay still if I were you.
4007211 4009421 Bud, just tap out, bud.<br />Bud, tap out!
4009422 4011840 Eddie, please don't die<br />like this. Eddie, please.
4011841 4013091 Daveed!
4013092 4014884 All we've been through! Come on!
4014885 4016219 Come on, help him!
4016220 4018221 Get lower. You're not listening!
4018222 4020557 - Eddie.
4020558 4022351 Oh, my god. He's gonna die.
4024687 4025895 No!
4025896 4027607 Hey, girl.
4036240 4037992 There you go, girl.
4039076 4040745 There you go.
4042330 4044247 There you go.
4044248 4047752 It's like cocaine Christmas.
4062767 4063933 Go!
4063934 4066854 Don't have to tell me twice.
4069273 4070940 Come on!
4070941 4072025 Daveed!
4072026 4073610 That bag's worth 14 million.
4073611 4076613 We had a truce, and a truce<br />is on god where I'm from.
4076614 4080241 Can't you see I'm trying<br />to help you, kid? Go!
4080242 4081951 I need that bag.
4081952 4084037 Leave it, man.<br />Let's just go home.
4084038 4086624 We're taking that bag<br />to Syd, Eddie.
4096676 4098636 Shot...
4100388 4102556 No. I didn't.
4106686 4108646 Run! Go, go!
4110356 4112108 Oh, shit!
4126372 4127997 Holy shit.
4127998 4130125 - Dad. What are you doing here?<br />Oh, shit.
4130126 4131334 Where's Gabe?
4131335 4132585 You didn't bring him here,<br />did you?
4132586 4134295 - Calm down.
4134296 4136381 He's safe at home watching TV.
4136382 4138299 What?<br />How long has he been alone?
4138300 4139884 You left him with me!
4139885 4143013 Do I look like<br />"daddy day care center" to you?
4143806 4145683 - Huh?
4146517 4149477 - The fuck happened to you?<br />- A lot.
4149478 4152063 - Did you get the coke?<br />- A little.
4152064 4154149 The bear ate most of it.
4154150 4156192 - What?<br />- The bear.
4156193 4158153 It fucking did cocaine.
4158154 4159654 A fucking...
4159655 4161990 A bear did cocaine, dad!
4161991 4163032 Fuck this!
4163033 4166161 Seriously,<br />fuck this entire journey.
4166162 4168079 Eddie, Eddie, just calm down.
4168080 4171082 Look at me. Look at me.
4171083 4172876 I'm on the hook here.
4172877 4177714 A lot of cocaine was lost<br />under my eye.
4177715 4179591 And the people that I deal with,
4179592 4182093 they don't care how,<br />just that it was.
4182094 4184012 And look at me.
4184013 4187557 They're gonna come after me,<br />my family
4187558 4191060 if I don't get them<br />every penny's worth.
4191061 4192979 You hear what I'm saying?
4192980 4195940 It's you and Gabe.
4195941 4197902 You understand?
4199820 4202323 We don't have a choice.
4204074 4206701 There's a bag<br />with the cop and the bear
4206702 4208829 over at the pavilion structure.
4210831 4212082 Come on.
4215336 4217254 Come on, son. Come on.
4224595 4226763 Who's there?
4226764 4228765 Easy.<br />Stay away.
4228766 4230391 Where's the duffel?
4230392 4232101 I gave it to the bear.
4232102 4234103 You gave it to the bear?
4234104 4236232 Yeah. The bear.
4237233 4238776 It loves coke.
4239693 4241653 Wh-which way did it go?
4241654 4243613 I'm not fucking around here.
4243614 4246115 Syd white.
4246116 4248660 Man, I've been following you<br />for years.
4248661 4250454 They all have.
4255292 4257961 Reba.
4257962 4260547 Oh, I always knew<br />you were my girl.
4260548 4261798 I got you now.
4261799 4263800 Be careful<br />when you cuff these guys.
4263801 4265386 They're kind of shifty.
4270474 4272225 What...
4272226 4273811 What are you doing?
4276564 4279691 - I'm sorry, Bob.<br />- I'm sorry, Bob.
4279692 4281568 You shot him?
4281569 4282694 I told you not to hurt him.
4282695 4284445 I don't work for you.
4284446 4286072 The department trusted you.
4286073 4289784 The state of Tennessee<br />trusted you.
4289785 4294497 The United States of America,<br />it trusted you.
4294498 4296165 I know.
4296166 4298626 - I trusted you with rosette.<br />- I know.
4298627 4300545 Who's rosette?
4300546 4301796 The dog in my car.
4301797 4303339 You left a dog in the car?
4303340 4305300 You left my son in Saint Louis.
4305301 4307177 How is she?
4314852 4316895 She being a good girl?
4316896 4319480 Yeah. She's such a good girl.
4319481 4320857 E-Enough.
4320858 4322984 Tell me which way the bear went,
4322985 4325612 or I'm gonna kill the dog<br />when I come down mountain.
4325613 4328114 Oh, no, no, please,<br />d-don't-don't do that.
4328115 4330408 I'd vote for not<br />killing the dog today,
4330409 4332285 but that's just me.
4332286 4334037 Well, what do you guys say?
4334038 4336373 What's so funny?
4338584 4340877 Apex predator,
4340878 4344214 high on cocaine,<br />and you're going towards it.
4350679 4352805 Dead north, man.
4352806 4354766 - Yes, we will.
4354767 4357602 Dead... dead north.
4357603 4359271 Let's go.
4400771 4403398 The devil bear is in there.
4403399 4405942 You can't go in there.
4405943 4408444 Do you have kids?
4408445 4409946 We would have.
4409947 4411698 I have to go find mine.
4411699 4413951 And his name would be Texas.
4414785 4416453 - Do you have a flashlight?<br />- Yeah.
4422126 4423210 Here.
4424086 4425461 Thank you.
4425462 4428131 Bye, lady and little man.
4428132 4429925 Bye, you both.
4431593 4433636 Okay.
4433637 4435889 Wait. What about me?
4456618 4458996 Watch where you step.
4460748 4463208 - I got you. Stay close.
4465544 4467838 What's that?
4472551 4473926 Don't move.
4473927 4475554 Stay still, Henry.
4481810 4483728 They look like polar bears.
4483729 4485104 Henry?
4485105 4486065 Dee Dee?
4486066 4487523 Dee Dee?<br />- Mama!
4487524 4489317 Don't move. I'm gonna get you<br />out of here, okay?
4489318 4491527 No, no. Them, they're...<br />They're harmless. -Dee Dee!
4491528 4493989 - Mama, I just...<br />- Baby!
4494782 4495948 Dee Dee, you're okay.
4495949 4497283 Are you hurt?
4497284 4498701 - It's just my leg.<br />- Your leg?
4498702 4500119 That looks really deep.
4500120 4502371 Here. Don't touch it.<br />- Ow! Ow! Henry!
4502372 4503831 Let's keep you warm.
4503832 4505374 Oh, my gosh.<br />You found my sweater.
4505375 4506667 You smart girl.
4506668 4508377 - You left us clues.<br />- Yeah.
4508378 4509754 We found you.
4509755 4511255 Put that on.
4511256 4514258 - Mom, I'm so sorry.<br />- Oh, I love you so much.
4514259 4515760 Oh, my god.
4515761 4517220 Mom, i'm-I'm so sorry.
4517221 4518471 - I'm sorry. I just...<br />- It's okay.
4518472 4519514 Henry told me everything.
4519515 4521057 Everything?
4521058 4522266 You mean that<br />you guys did drugs?
4522267 4523935 - You told her?<br />No.
4523936 4525895 I had a suspicion,<br />and you just confirmed it.
4525896 4528189 I'm just so glad I found you<br />and you're okay.
4528190 4532110 - Um, what was that?
4532111 4534196 Cocaine bear's back.
4534988 4536823 - Can you walk?<br />- Uh, a little.
4536824 4538324 Come on. Let's go, Henry.
4538325 4539617 Go that way.
4539618 4540869 Go ahead.
4542579 4544705 It's okay. Come on.
4544706 4546792 Look. It's a way out.
4549962 4552506 It's the falls.<br />Oh, wow.
4562057 4564517 Henry, stay away from the ledge!
4564518 4566478 Oh, god.
4615027 4617362 This is it.
4620657 4622283 Syd, let's cut our losses.
4622284 4624869 All right? Let's just deal<br />with the fallout.
4624870 4627748 You saw what that bear did<br />to that hiker.
4631210 4633253 What is that?
4634796 4636297 - Oh, fuck!
4636298 4638550 What the fuck? What the fuck?
4640719 4642554 Come on.
4648018 4649602 Eddie.
4649603 4651688 Take this.
4656485 4658362 Fuck.
4664451 4666453 Thank you.
4675128 4678005 Goddamn bear.
4678006 4679591 Eddie, put the rest in the bag.
4689059 4690893 You got what you wanted?
4690894 4692229 Let's go.
4695399 4698609 There's-there's a lot more<br />out there.
4698610 4701571 We got to keep looking, understand?
4703907 4705574 We're not whole yet.
4705575 4707536 I'm leaving, Syd.
4711623 4713083 Go.
4737607 4739609 Give me the bag.
4741069 4743404 When did you all get so soft?
4743405 4746533 All got sand in your pussies.
4749328 4752038 Mom! How are we gonna<br />get out of here?
4752039 4754081 It's a dead end. What do we do?
4754082 4755792 Stay away from the bears.
4758920 4761130 This way.
4761131 4762882 Come on. There's an opening.
4762883 4764967 Henry, come here.
4764968 4767429 Dee Dee, get in here.<br />Someone's coming.
4769097 4771183 He has a gun.

4787491 4790493 Syd, there's kids here.<br />Let's just go.
4790494 4792745 No, I'm not leaving<br />without that cocaine!
4792746 4796165 So somebody better bring it down<br />or somebody else is gonna die.
4796166 4797709 You understand?
4800170 4801545 Go.
4801546 4803507 Come on. Help him out!<br />- Yeah, yeah.

4817062 4819230 W-We're not gonna say anything,<br />but we're going home.
4819231 4820774 Nobody's going anywhere!
4822317 4824235 - Dad.<br />- Shut up, Eddie.

5118363 5120739 I need you to know,<br />what I said earlier...
5120740 5122908 You're more than a drug dealer,<br />all right?
5122909 5124743 You're my friend.<br />You're my best friend.
5124744 5127122 - All right?<br />- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
5128289 5130708 Hey, hey, I...
5130709 5132876 I got my last question.
5132877 5134169 What?
5134170 5135671 It's 20 questions.
5135672 5137506 I got my last one.
5137507 5140218 What? All right. Sure.
5142429 5144638 Is it joanie?
5144639 5146181 It's joanie, right?
5146182 5147851 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.
5148601 5150644 How'd you guess?
5150645 5153355 You're so fucking obvious.
5153356 5155315 I just didn't want to guess it
5155316 5157193 to have you crying on me<br />all day.
5166870 5168996 She's a nurse!
5168997 5170706 He-he got grazed by a bullet.
5170707 5172040 He's in shock.
5172041 5173752 Put pressure on him.
5231768 5234061 I've called backup.
5234062 5236606 Her name's rosette.<br />She doesn't like fetch.
5237398 5239566 You should get going.
5239567 5241778 Take care of yourself.
5246825 5250078 Hi. Hi.
5251371 5253122 Rosette.
5264384 5265801 Whose dog is this?
5265802 5267386 I think it's mine.
5267387 5269137 Mine and Gabe's.
5269138 5270472 Is it on cocaine?
5270473 5272392 No.
5273810 5275979 That's a good dog.
5278147 5280357 So we just grab Gabe<br />and go, right?
5280358 5281860 Yeah.
5285572 5287239 I knew you'd be okay.
5287240 5289658 You're the toughest person<br />I know.
5289659 5292619 I think you get that<br />from your mom.
5292620 5293996 I think you're right.
5293997 5296164 Thanks for coming to get me.
5296165 5298417 I'm your mom. I love you.
5298418 5301086 You, too, Henry.
5301087 5303589 Hey, I'm sorry I pushed ray<br />on you too soon.
5303590 5306342 No. You deserve to be happy.
5307594 5309219 Henry, let's walk over here.
5309220 5311597 - Stay away from that. Come on.<br />I want to look.
5311598 5313015 I also don't want to look.
5313016 5314725 Ugh.<br />Don't look.
5314726 5317019 - Let's just cruise on by.
5317020 5319605 Oh, here come the po-po.
5319606 5320981 Hey, mom.
5320982 5323233 I want to go to Nashville<br />with you and ray.
5323234 5326320 Maybe we can go after<br />me and Henry get out of rehab.
5326321 5327696 Rehab?
5327697 5329406 We're cokeheads now.
5329407 5330866 You know?
5330867 5332409 We got the bite,<br />and we're about that life,
5332410 5333827 - Mrs. Mckinndry.<br />Mm-hmm.
5333828 5336164 Yeah, you're<br />too grounded for rehab.
5351888 5353388 Rodney, are you getting it?
5353389 5355432 I swear to god, Carol.
5355433 5357017 Well, then zoom in.
5357018 5359228 - Is the red light on?<br />- No, I got it.
5360438 5361939 Oh, they're so cute.
5361940 5363523 Oh, this is gonna be good.
5363524 5364733 Wait.
5364734 5366401 Why are they looking<br />at us like that?
5366402 5368153 Oh.
5368154 5369696 Oh, shit.
