239000 242000 I can't make it down the mountain.
242000 247000 You got a big day today. You better put on a heavy face.
269000 272000 Let's go, Arthur.
272000 273000 Come on, Fleck.
273000 276000 If only you're fancy lawyer, blame him and leave your late.
276000 279000 She knows what you like me, right?
279000 282000 Take Fleck, you got a joke for us today?
282000 286000 Yeah, it's been a while, hasn't it?
286000 289000 I'm sorry.
289000 291000 I'm sorry.
291000 293000 I'm sorry.
293000 295000 I'm sorry.
296000 298000 Let's go!
298000 300000 Back to fuck up, Kevin.
300000 301000 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
301000 303000 From the line.
303000 306000 Fleck, you.
306000 308000 I'm sorry.
308000 310000 I'm sorry.
310000 312000 I'm sorry.
312000 314000 I'm sorry.
314000 316000 I'm sorry.
316000 317000 I'm sorry.
317000 319000 I'm sorry.
319000 321000 I'm sorry.
321000 324000 Fleck, you got a joke for me.
325000 327000 Go.
334000 337000 All the kids done since he got here is fucking smile.
337000 339000 Today, all of a sudden he bites Moran.
339000 344000 Because nobody likes Moran, he was a guy for a stay for like eight years before he got here.
344000 347000 He's still a fucking tent.
348000 353000 Fleck, you got a joke for us today?
353000 355000 I already asked.
355000 358000 I got a joke for you.
358000 363000 Why didn't you tell me the dog was Patrick?
363000 366000 Clean yourself up.
366000 370000 You like that one, Arthur?
370000 372000 Let's go.
372000 375000 Why didn't you tell me the dog?
375000 379000 Why didn't you tell me the dog was a cat?
405000 407000 Why?
407000 409000 I'm sorry.
409000 411000 I'm sorry.
411000 413000 I'm sorry.
413000 434000 I'm sorry.
434000 438000 The other half lives.
438000 444000 Could have been all yours if you hadn't killed Findings, no.
444000 460000 I love the show and it's portfolio.
460000 461000 I'm gonna get it.
461000 462000 Moira.
463000 464000 Hey.
478000 479000 Come on.
486000 488000 Jesus Christ, you couldn't get him a fucking umbrella.
489000 490000 Get her on there.
495000 497000 Today we're meeting with Dr. Beatty.
497000 498000 Remember her.
499000 501000 She's gonna be videotaping you this time
501000 504000 so we can show it at your competency hearing next week.
505000 507000 And if they find you competent,
507000 509000 and they will, they always do.
509000 511000 Then we're going to trial.
512000 515000 You need to be in an actual hospital
515000 517000 with actual doctors.
518000 520000 Not as department of corrections.
520000 521000 Bullshit.
521000 522000 Those thugs.
524000 526000 Dr. Beatty thinks
526000 528000 that with everything that happened to you
528000 529000 in your childhood,
529000 531000 it caused a split.
533000 536000 This fragmentation in you
536000 538000 to help me cope with your pain.
539000 541000 She believes you have another person
541000 543000 living inside of you.
543000 545000 And it was this other person
545000 548000 who committed those crimes.
550000 552000 Do you understand what that means, Arthur?
556000 558000 I'll be asking you a few questions today,
558000 559000 Arthur, okay?
561000 565000 Maybe you don't remember some things
565000 568000 or you're confused about what you did.
569000 571000 I'm here to help you try and sort out what happened.
576000 580000 Arthur, I'm not here only to help with your defense.
583000 585000 I'm here for you.
585000 587000 But for me to do my job,
587000 590000 I need you to be candid with me.
590000 592000 Does that make sense?
595000 597000 Can I have a cigarette?
597000 599000 Of course he can.
606000 608000 Can I have a cigarette?
619000 620000 Who?
626000 627000 Yeah!
635000 638000 Let's start with the first incident, okay?
639000 644000 The three men who have costed you on the subway will bully you.
644000 649000 Did you feel like they triggered something painful from your past, your childhood?
650000 652000 Do you remember any of what happened?
656000 660000 Did you black out, see bright lights?
666000 668000 Okay.
671000 673000 How about Marie Franklin?
675000 678000 What if anything do you remember about that night?
685000 686000 The music.
688000 689000 That's good?
690000 691000 After that is good?
691000 694000 Can I tell you what I remember about that night?
695000 696000 I remember.
697000 700000 You came out just as Joker.
701000 704000 And I remember Joker dancing to that music.
707000 708000 Right?
711000 712000 I really like his band.
713000 716000 My mom and I used to watch it.
717000 718000 They show together.
718000 719000 They show together.
720000 722000 She like Marie Franklin as well.
724000 728000 They stole a handsome look at those bare-wood ones here.
731000 733000 Is that your mother's voice?
734000 737000 Do you often hear her voice in your head?
738000 740000 I was alright.
742000 745000 Did it change at all after she died?
746000 748000 What does that mean?
749000 750000 Did you...
752000 754000 This other part of you...
755000 756000 Joker...
757000 759000 Did it come out more after she died?
760000 762000 You lived together, right? In a one-bedroom apartment?
768000 770000 Maybe I could talk to Joker about it.
772000 774000 Would he like to talk to me?
775000 776000 I don't know.
801000 802000 Hey Arthur!
803000 804000 Arthur!
806000 808000 The guard said, you wanted to show me how to kiss.
811000 813000 They said Joker's a really good kisser.
814000 816000 Nobody's ever gave me a kiss before.
831000 833000 You know, Ricky knows no one in.
834000 836000 No hesitation.
840000 842000 I gotta be honest with you Arthur.
843000 845000 I wouldn't have took you for a hopeless romantic.
846000 847000 Let's go!
847000 849000 You chose it. Line up back to him.
850000 851000 You're a really serious...
852000 853000 I haven't been serious.
854000 855000 In the Bible.
856000 857000 It wasn't that hard either.
858000 860000 And since they made that TV movie about you,
861000 863000 everybody's still a thing here to star.
865000 866000 How about you Arthur?
867000 869000 Do you still think you're a star?
871000 873000 I bet you do, don't you?
876000 878000 I said that's life.
879000 880000 Not right now, sir.
882000 883000 That's a million.
884000 885000 That's life.
886000 887000 That's a lot of people say.
913000 914000 I'm a king.
915000 917000 I've been up and down and over and out.
918000 919000 And I know one thing.
920000 925000 Each time I find myself in flames, I know my face.
926000 932000 I just take myself up and get back in the race.
933000 935000 And I'm funny, and I'm funny.
936000 939000 And I can't deny it.
940000 942000 Many times I thought I'd come now.
943000 945000 But my heart was fine.
946000 950000 But if there's no winch, it'd come to see a drive.
953000 959000 I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball.
960000 964000 In my...
974000 976000 I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball.
982000 983000 Let's go.
988000 989000 Let's go.
995000 996000 You are the...
997000 998000 Shut down at the cannon this morning.
999000 1000000 I'll let these things...
1000000 1001000 Let's go.
1003000 1005000 Oh, when the saints go marching in...
1012000 1019000 I wanna be in that number when the men are at the party day.
1020000 1023000 This is a time when the men are happy.
1024000 1026000 We're singing together again.
1027000 1029000 We're singing together.
1031000 1033000 Hold it, hold it, hold it.
1035000 1037000 A group I want you to welcome Arthur to play.
1039000 1042000 Now I know it's odd to have an inmate from E-Warden here,
1043000 1047000 but I've been assured he's been a model patient without any incidents.
1049000 1052000 I know this might feel strange, Mr. Flick, a new environment.
1053000 1056000 You see, we use music in this class to make us whole,
1057000 1060000 to balance the conflicting forces, the...
1061000 1063000 the fractures within ourselves.
1064000 1069000 All I ask is that you sing, if and when you're ready to sing.
1071000 1072000 Okay, let's go.
1082000 1083000 I'm on this radio.
1084000 1085000 I can't wait.
1085000 1086000 I know it's...
1089000 1090000 Is it really you?
1091000 1092000 Yeah?
1092000 1093000 Yeah, I want to go.
1093000 1094000 Yeah, I can't sing.
1096000 1100000 I got the world on a string, second on a rainbow.
1101000 1104000 Got this string around my finger.
1107000 1109000 And then we'll sleep.
1113000 1114000 Arthur.
1114000 1115000 I know.
1121000 1123000 So what's a nice guy located in a place like this?
1124000 1125000 I can't find people.
1126000 1127000 More in my financial television.
1129000 1130000 What about you?
1132000 1134000 I set fire to my parents apartment building.
1138000 1139000 Actually...
1140000 1141000 I'm six.
1142000 1144000 No, we must probably come in my mother.
1147000 1148000 I should have done that.
1149000 1151000 My mother had me committed.
1152000 1153000 She says I'm psychotic.
1156000 1160000 You know, most of us, that TV movie they made about you like 20 times.
1161000 1162000 Yeah.
1162000 1163000 Really bad?
1164000 1165000 Don't want to let me watch it.
1166000 1167000 It was good.
1169000 1170000 It was really good.
1171000 1173000 I grew up in the same neighborhood.
1173000 1176000 Me and my friends used to take that staircase to school every day.
1177000 1179000 My parents didn't give a fuck about me either.
1179000 1181000 My father beat the shit out of me.
1185000 1186000 Well, guess what?
1186000 1187000 Knock knock.
1188000 1189000 Sorry, kid.
1189000 1191000 Your dad was killing a car accident.
1195000 1196000 Sorry.
1197000 1198000 I'm sorry.
1200000 1201000 Oh, my God.
1203000 1205000 If only those friends could see me now.
1209000 1210000 When I first saw Joker,
1211000 1213000 when I saw you and Murray Franklin,
1214000 1216000 the whole time I was watching, I kept thinking,
1217000 1220000 I hope this guy blows his brains out.
1225000 1226000 And then you did.
1230000 1232000 And for once in my life,
1233000 1235000 I didn't feel so alone anymore.
1240000 1242000 Forget your troubles.
1242000 1243000 Come on.
1243000 1244000 Get happy.
1246000 1249000 Better chase all your cares than play.
1250000 1252000 See, hallelujah.
1252000 1253000 Come on.
1253000 1254000 Get happy.
1255000 1257000 And before the judgment.
1261000 1263000 Son, you're shining.
1263000 1264000 Come on.
1264000 1265000 Get happy.
1267000 1270000 Lord, he's waiting to take your hand.
1271000 1273000 Sing hallelujah.
1273000 1274000 Come on.
1274000 1275000 Get happy.
1285000 1286000 Hey, Jackie.
1287000 1290000 You wanna know what I've ever read most from being on Murray Franklin show?
1291000 1292000 What's that?
1293000 1296000 That I didn't shoot first to let him ask me questions later.
1299000 1300000 That a joke, Arthur.
1302000 1303000 Yeah.
1308000 1310000 How long it took was you getting a little old-fashioned?
1311000 1312000 Thanks, pal.
1317000 1318000 That's good to medication.
1320000 1323000 Not guilty by reason of insanity makes no sense in this case.
1324000 1325000 And his...
1326000 1327000 A flag.
1327000 1328000 He acts violent.
1328000 1329000 You're in the noise.
1329000 1330000 I'm in the noise.
1330000 1331000 I'm in our city.
1331000 1332000 But I'm in our city.
1332000 1333000 I'm in the noise.
1333000 1334000 I'm in the noise.
1334000 1335000 I'm in the noise.
1335000 1336000 I'm in the noise.
1336000 1337000 I'm in the noise.
1337000 1338000 I'm in the noise.
1339000 1340000 I'm in our city.
1340000 1341000 But all over the country.
1341000 1342000 I'm in the noise.
1342000 1343000 Our friends are million people.
1343000 1345000 Judge says he's confident to stand trial.
1345000 1346000 I'm still in the noise.
1346000 1347000 He's fucking new.
1350000 1351000 These people...
1352000 1355000 They believe Arthur Fleck to be some kind of...
1356000 1357000 Marvin.
1357000 1358000 Well, he's not.
1359000 1362000 Arthur Fleck is a monster for you exactly what he was doing.
1363000 1366000 And our office will be seeking the death penalty.
1366000 1367000 Thank you.
1367000 1368000 Thank you.
1368000 1369000 Oh, that's...
1369000 1370000 Yes, sir.
1370000 1372000 You hear that, Fleck?
1372000 1373000 The death penalty.
1373000 1375000 They're gonna fry you out of here.
1376000 1377000 How does that feel?
1383000 1386000 For once in my life,
1388000 1391000 I have someone who needs me.
1392000 1396000 Someone I've needed so long.
1399000 1401000 For once,
1401000 1403000 I'm afraid
1403000 1407000 I can go where life leads me.
1408000 1412000 Somehow, I'll know I'll be strong.
1414000 1417000 For once I can touch
1418000 1421000 For my heart used to dream of
1423000 1425000 Long before I knew
1427000 1431000 Someone more like you
1432000 1435000 Make my dreams come true
1437000 1439000 For once in my life,
1439000 1441000 I won't let sorrow hurt me
1441000 1444000 Not like it's hurt me before
1445000 1448000 For once I have someone
1448000 1450000 I know will desert me
1450000 1453000 And I'm not alone anymore
1455000 1458000 For once I can say this is mine
1458000 1459000 You can't take it
1459000 1462000 Long as I know I've got love
1462000 1464000 I can take it
1464000 1466000 For once in my life,
1466000 1469000 I've got someone who needs me.
1475000 1479000 For once I can say this is mine
1479000 1481000 You can't take it
1481000 1484000 Long as I know I've got love
1484000 1486000 I can make it
1486000 1488000 For once in my life,
1488000 1491000 I've got someone who needs me.
1491000 1494000 For once I can say this is mine
1494000 1495000 You can't take it
1495000 1498000 Long as I know I've got love
1498000 1499000 I can make it
1499000 1501000 For once in my life,
1501000 1503000 I've got someone
1504000 1506000 Who wants in my life,
1506000 1510000 I've got someone who wants in my life
1512000 1513000 I'm entering Arthur
1513000 1514000 How's it make you feel?
1514000 1515000 You scared?
1515000 1516000 No.
1516000 1518000 Stay.
1518000 1519000 No.
1519000 1521000 We died, don't you?
1525000 1527000 Ha ha ha ha ha
1527000 1529000 Ha ha ha ha
1529000 1531000 Ha ha ha ha
1532000 1536000 Ha ha ha
1552000 1556000 Ha ha ha ha
1556000 1559000 Ha ha ha
1559000 1577000 No, you cannot give any statements to the press, even if Kellerman asked you to.
1577000 1579000 You know they've been out there all week.
1579000 1583000 This evening, they want to talk to me.
1583000 1589000 I told you before, I forgot that an exclusive interview next month, right before trial.
1589000 1594000 Okay, but, but Kellerman asked me to make a statement now.
1594000 1597000 He was letting me go to this meeting night. You're like an old person.
1597000 1599000 What are you telling me you have?
1599000 1600000 Come on, last time.
1600000 1603000 Okay, um, yeah, I'm sorry, after that.
1603000 1604000 I told you.
1604000 1606000 Okay, let's move it.
1606000 1608000 Hang on, Frank. He's signing my book.
1609000 1612000 Like a quick Arthur, I don't want to miss the beginning.
1612000 1616000 But, in court, the fortune when they rise in the house.
1621000 1623000 Easy now.
1634000 1635000 Let's go.
1639000 1646000 I'm using the whole musical. I'm sick of these articles and barriers between the musical and the drama.
1646000 1650000 Well, then you certainly don't need me.
1650000 1654000 Yes, we do, because you can be greater than you ever were.
1654000 1658000 We are going to make her explode on the fear to seem like a skyrocket,
1658000 1663000 not just in the old tray barf with the top hat diet tails, but a great asset to the degree of his power.
1663000 1665000 Then you've told me a hundred.
1666000 1667000 I'm not kidding.
1668000 1669000 Don't you?
1669000 1671000 I know that.
1671000 1674000 Everything's going to work out.
1674000 1675000 Shh.
1675000 1678000 Well, what do you think I am? What do you think they are?
1678000 1680000 What do you think they're the other? Is it all entertainment?
1680000 1681000 Believe me.
1681000 1686000 There is no difference between the magic rhythms of Bill Robinson's immortal feet you said before.
1686000 1687000 All right, all right.
1687000 1690000 Well, what did Bill Robinson do? He doubts him the stairs, didn't he?
1690000 1694000 Now, I happened to play either, but the King of the same stairs was the difference when all the ideas were.
1694000 1698000 Show me the laws, let those comic and burn, let's deny, show you, let's entertain her.
1698000 1699000 We're all, and uh...
1699000 1700000 Aah!
1700000 1702000 Look at this song.
1703000 1709000 Everything that happens in life can happen in a show.
1709000 1717000 You can make a laugh, you can make a cry, anything, anything can go.
1717000 1747000 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
1748000 1770000 Once MedUSHED And the H ASAP smiteenerrrrah
1770000 1772000 Let's go!
1772000 1774000 Yeah!
1774000 1776000 Let's go!
1776000 1778000 Yeah!
1778000 1796000 They could see me now, that little king of mine.
1796000 1800000 Ohhhhhh!
1800000 1808000 I'm looking at your smile and it's a healthy sign.
1808000 1818000 I'd like the stumble bones to see for a friend.
1818000 1824000 The kind of tough, poor, first free,
1824000 1828000 I'm going to show you how you do it.
1835000 1837000 I can't believe that.
1837000 1839000 I told you when we get out of here.
1839000 1842000 That crazy.
1842000 1846000 All I can say is, wow, just look at where I am.
1846000 1851000 Tonight I landed in pop, right in my car, love jam.
1851000 1854000 What I said, I'm the only gal.
1854000 1858000 I'll never believe it if my friends could save me.
1858000 1860000 Oh, fuck!
1864000 1866000 God, this is me.
1872000 1875000 Susan, this is our family now, won't it?
1882000 1887000 If they could see me now, that little dusty group.
1887000 1892000 Chicks around this million dollar to give to a Roman elbow
1892000 1899000 and the cream of the prop to ever send their ain't no one at the time.
1912000 1915000 I'm going to think the same as that,
1915000 1917000 which I must say is,
1917000 1919000 each to pick an unknown gal,
1919000 1921000 which I'll look down at me,
1921000 1923000 but I'll still go well,
1923000 1927000 calling gal, no, never believe it if my friends could save me,
1927000 1929000 if my friends could save me,
1929000 1933000 if they all could go to jail.
1933000 1935000 Oh!
1935000 1937000 Get the fuck off!
1937000 1939000 No!
1939000 1941000 No!
1941000 1943000 No!
1947000 1949000 That's all.
1953000 1955000 That's the bottom of the left.
1959000 1962000 I want to play games on my watch, Arthur.
1962000 1965000 Who weeks is all of you?
1966000 1968000 Oh!
1971000 1973000 Julia, stay.
1995000 2021000 MUSIC
2022000 2024000 Take my hand
2024000 2026000 Stay here, my friend.
2026000 2030000 I'll find my way back to you.
2030000 2036000 Here and all, I know somehow
2036000 2040000 we tell a story that's true.
2044000 2048000 In our minds, we'd be just fine
2048000 2052000 if it were only us two.
2054000 2060000 There might say that we're crazy,
2062000 2070000 but I'm just still alive with you.
2075000 2077000 There's my guy.
2078000 2082000 I'm in a row right here.
2082000 2084000 Yeah.
2084000 2088000 One of the cards let me in.
2088000 2091000 I'd do anything for you,
2091000 2094000 but we don't have a lot of time.
2094000 2096000 Come here.
2096000 2097000 Come here.
2097000 2099000 Can you get up?
2099000 2103000 Come into the light.
2108000 2111000 They're sending me home.
2111000 2113000 Why?
2113000 2117000 They're saying you're a bad influence on me.
2117000 2120000 Good.
2120000 2123000 This is going to be good for us.
2123000 2126000 Now I can be at your trial every day.
2126000 2129000 I can see you every day until you get up.
2129000 2131000 No, no, no.
2131000 2133000 I'm not.
2134000 2136000 I'm not.
2138000 2141000 We're going to build a map.
2144000 2146000 Wait a minute.
2158000 2161000 You're perfect.
2161000 2164000 I want to see the room.
2164000 2167000 I'm not.
2188000 2191000 Look what they did here.
2225000 2228000 It's just us now.
2242000 2245000 You need to start taking your medication.
2245000 2247000 I'm over to you.
2254000 2257000 I'm over here.
2267000 2269000 Keep going.
2269000 2271000 Here.
2284000 2287000 I'm over here.
2307000 2310000 What are you going to ask me about?
2310000 2313000 Besides, no.
2313000 2320000 Hopefully about your life and your conditions are really like in this place.
2320000 2323000 I'd ask you about me.
2323000 2328000 She's been out there giving a lot of interviews about you and about herself.
2328000 2330000 Good.
2330000 2332000 I love her.
2332000 2335000 She gets me.
2338000 2342000 Arthur, this is a chance for you to show a different side.
2342000 2345000 Show a different side of yourself.
2345000 2348000 The public can see who you really are.
2348000 2350000 I don't think you should smoke.
2350000 2353000 I think it makes you a cavalier.
2353000 2359000 We need to use this time to show people that you're human.
2359000 2363000 They need to understand you are sick, delusional.
2363000 2368000 You're not joker or girth or fleck.
2368000 2370000 Hmm?
2370000 2372000 Don't worry.
2372000 2374000 You're going to be great.
2376000 2378000 Arthur!
2382000 2384000 Are you okay?
2384000 2388000 It's not too late to cancel.
2392000 2397000 So, uh, you want me to call you Arthur or the joker?
2397000 2402000 Mr. Myers, you know we have an agreement you can't call him joker, it's Arthur.
2402000 2405000 Arthur, fleck.
2405000 2407000 Are you ready, buddy?
2407000 2410000 She has to leave now.
2410000 2413000 You can watch from behind the glass, but you can't be in here.
2413000 2415000 Brain's up.
2418000 2424000 Well, Patty, um...
2424000 2426000 I was going through a lot back then.
2426000 2430000 Um, I don't really remember much from that night.
2430000 2434000 Uh, blacked out, saw bright lights.
2434000 2439000 I was having a hard time knowing the difference between what was real or not.
2439000 2440000 Oh, please?
2440000 2442000 You did it on live TV pal.
2442000 2445000 It wasn't getting any more real than that.
2445000 2451000 How do you all remember from that night is I was going to kill myself on television.
2452000 2458000 I thought Murray was playing a part in my show, but he was a bad actor.
2458000 2460000 So he got what he deserved.
2460000 2463000 The last joke, if we can call it a joke.
2463000 2466000 You get what you bleeping deserve, that's what you said.
2466000 2468000 That's not funny, that's not funny.
2468000 2472000 You're right, I thought it's a little better one.
2473000 2475000 You're trying to be funny now?
2475000 2477000 Yeah.
2478000 2481000 Do you deserve to die?
2481000 2483000 The DA is calling for the death penalty.
2483000 2487000 You just said that you wanted to kill yourself on TV, so tell us.
2487000 2490000 You still want to die?
2490000 2495000 Well, at the time it certainly could have had these dreams for a little bit.
2495000 2498000 Um, but that's not me anymore.
2498000 2500000 That's not...
2500000 2502000 That's not who I am?
2502000 2503000 That wasn't really you.
2503000 2504000 No, that's not...
2504000 2505000 That's funny, that's straight.
2505000 2506000 That's not what I'm saying.
2506000 2508000 Your defense is...
2508000 2510000 It was the Joker who did it.
2510000 2511000 An insanity.
2511000 2513000 Okay, I don't know what other defense...
2513000 2518000 This alternate personality, this killer clown in you killed Murray.
2518000 2520000 Who am I speaking to now?
2520000 2522000 Which one of you is here?
2522000 2527000 The poor, low IQ author Fleck, or the Joker who go to the bunch of no-bit punks?
2527000 2529000 Do you really care?
2529000 2531000 You don't.
2531000 2534000 You just like Murray, you just like everyone.
2534000 2535000 You just...
2535000 2537000 You want sensationalism, you don't care about...
2537000 2541000 You just want something about my mistakes, and what's about the things that I did in the past,
2541000 2542000 what about who I am now?
2542000 2546000 Not how I'm different now.
2546000 2551000 That's what we should be talking about, Patty.
2551000 2553000 Okay, okay.
2553000 2554000 We should take a break.
2554000 2556000 We're not taking a break.
2556000 2557000 Come on.
2557000 2559000 Okay, so...
2559000 2561000 Tell us.
2561000 2564000 What's changed, Arthur?
2564000 2568000 I'll tell you what's changed, Patty.
2568000 2571000 I'm not alone anymore.
2571000 2573000 Right.
2573000 2577000 The girl who was singing, the night you tried to escape.
2577000 2579000 I wanted to try to escape.
2579000 2582000 Miss Harley Quenzel.
2582000 2585000 You two put on quite a performance that time.
2585000 2588000 Oh...
2588000 2591000 She didn't really sign through, isn't she?
2591000 2593000 You told me.
2593000 2596000 I mean, don't you think it's all...
2596000 2599000 I don't think it's a little too much.
2599000 2603000 A little much.
2605000 2611000 She's a fool, and I won't hide in her head.
2612000 2618000 But a fool can have her trust.
2618000 2626000 I'm in love, and don't ask her with.
2626000 2632000 I thought they'd been on.
2633000 2639000 Those the same old sad sensation.
2639000 2646000 Really, I've not slept a wink.
2646000 2649000 Since this half-punt.
2649000 2658000 In the torsion, put me on the blink.
2662000 2672000 I'm wild again.
2672000 2677000 Be wild again.
2677000 2681000 A semperine when we're in,
2681000 2684000 child again.
2684000 2687000 He wished...
2688000 2695000 Father, and be wilder.
2695000 2702000 Have I?
2702000 2709000 That's my heart, but what of it?
2709000 2712000 She is cool.
2712000 2716000 I agree.
2718000 2723000 She can love, and I love it.
2723000 2730000 Oh, wrong, wrong love, song.
2733000 2737000 I'll sing to her.
2737000 2740000 Things spring to her.
2740000 2744000 And long for the day,
2744000 2749000 that I cling to her.
2749000 2753000 Be wild.
2753000 2759000 I'll ever have you well knew.
2759000 2764000 Hey!
2764000 2767000 You're not mine.
2768000 2774000 We'll be back with more of Arthur Fleck.
2774000 2779000 And from what was was her son?
2784000 2787000 The murder trial of Arthur Fleck will begin today.
2787000 2790000 Assistant DA Harvey Dent is preparing his opening remarks
2790000 2793000 in what some are calling the trial of the century.
2793000 2796000 And once the protests, please will be on high alert,
2796000 2801000 to closing surrounding streets and setting up barricades for crowds that can reach in the thousands.
2801000 2805000 And be asking me, this is what you can when there's a complete breakdown in social services,
2805000 2808000 and don't get me started on this media frenzy.
2808000 2810000 All right, Denise, you're on the air.
2810000 2811000 Thank you for taking my call.
2811000 2813000 Enough is enough.
2813000 2815000 This idiot doesn't deserve a trial.
2815000 2817000 He should be sent straight to the chair.
2817000 2819000 An example should be made out of.
2819000 2821000 And we have a problem with you, too.
2822000 2828000 Good evening.
2828000 2842000 Home?
2842000 2846000 But away from her.
2846000 2848000 Oh
2876000 2878000 Oh
2906000 2908000 Oh
2936000 2938000 Oh
2944000 2946000 Listen
2950000 2952000 Okay
2957000 2959000 There is
2960000 2962000 Hey, shut the fuck up
2962000 2964000 I
2992000 2996000 Court is now in session the honorable judge Herman Rothwax is decided
3000000 3003000 Morning ladies and gentlemen, please be seated
3006000 3008000 William please invite the jury in
3017000 3019000 Are you all right mr. Flack
3020000 3026000 Everything okay? Here's your majesty. I'm just looking for someone
3029000 3031000 Please mr. Flack sit down I
3034000 3036000 Realize there's a lot going on
3036000 3038000 But this is still a court of law
3039000 3045000 Any and all outbursts will not be tolerated and applies to everyone in this courtroom
3045000 3052000 Cindy please call the case the people of the state of New York versus Arthur Flick case number GC
3075000 3077000 Oh
3082000 3084000 Walling down
3091000 3093000 actor
3093000 3097000 Where the hell would this mean?
3097000 3101000 That's entertainment
3105000 3112000 The lights on the lady and ties on the bride
3112000 3117000 With the guy on the side or the fold
3117000 3122000 Where she gives it a role
3122000 3130000 It's my view that there is absolutely no evidence that Arthur Fleck suffers from multiple personality disorder
3130000 3140000 Or that he ever behaved in the role of joker as a separate personality dissociated from himself
3140000 3145000 Doctor? In your opinion, concerning the work he did on this case
3145000 3150000 Do you believe Mr. Fleck suffers from a mental disease or defect?
3150000 3158000 No. In my opinion, he's not psychotic or unable to test reality
3158000 3161000 I think he was sane when you committed these crimes
3161000 3167000 In fact, I believe he fakes his mental illness
3167000 3171000 Why?
3171000 3178000 And if he's, uh, faking it, as you say
3178000 3183000 Then what is your opinion on the defendant's mental condition?
3183000 3192000 I believe he has four relatively minor and quite common mental disorders that involve long standing sadness
3192000 3196000 Narcissistic self-centeredness, friendlessness
3196000 3199000 And indifference to the feelings of others
3199000 3202000 This is a very disturbed individual
3202000 3206000 But I can't give you any kind of psychiatric defense
3206000 3210000 For you. Thank you, Dr. Love
3210000 3214000 Nothing further, Your Honor
3214000 3219000 Your witness, Ms. Stewart?
3219000 3222000 Dr. Lou, good morning
3222000 3224000 Good morning
3224000 3227000 How long did you interview Arthur Fleck for?
3227000 3229000 About two hours
3229000 3231000 About two hours
3231000 3234000 It's actually 89 minutes
3234000 3239000 Tell me, how can you say for certain that Arthur isn't mentally ill?
3239000 3250000 How can you be so sure after just 89 minutes that this joker isn't a distinctly separate and split personality from him?
3250000 3252000 That that's not who he is
3252000 3260000 Well, I also reviewed all the test results, psychological tests, neurological and medical tests
3260000 3264000 And in my view, it's just a performance
3264000 3269000 Did you read the records from the Department of Social Services
3269000 3277000 That show that when Arthur was seven years old, they returned him to his abuser's home
3277000 3279000 His mother's home
3279000 3282000 I did, yes
3282000 3286000 And when you interviewed him for 89 minutes
3286000 3298000 Did you ask him why social services didn't believe the horrific stories a seven year old boy told him about the physical and sexual of abuse he suffered?
3298000 3299000 Yeah
3299000 3303000 Applause
3303000 3310000 Applause
3310000 3313000 Applause
3313000 3316000 Applause
3316000 3320000 Applause
3320000 3321000 Yeah
3321000 3325000 Applause
3325000 3328000 Applause
3329000 3336000 No, I didn't ask him about that
3336000 3353000 So you want us to believe that after spending just 89 minutes with Arthur Fleck and reading through his records and tests from the same government agencies that abandoned him
3353000 3363000 You want us to believe that you can say with absolute certainty that Arthur doesn't suffer from any serious mental illness
3363000 3373000 That he didn't need to retreat into fantasy and create another identity to protect that scared, vulnerable
3373000 3378000 Seven year old boy from all the trauma and abuse he suffered
3378000 3383000 And that that identity didn't come out again
3383000 3390000 When he was attacked and tormented by three drunk bullies on the subway
3390000 3393000 Applause
3393000 3399000 After I woke up this morning, I thought, Murray, Murray, Murray
3399000 3403000 And then there's Murray, funny, right?
3403000 3407000 Then I remember Sophie, I had enough of it
3407000 3411000 Your Honor, again, my client's personal diary is privileged
3411000 3420000 Overroaled, again, as long as Mrs. Kane limits her comments to Mr. Fleck's personal private jokes to remember my quiet
3420000 3425000 These are your words, she's reading
3425000 3429000 And it's up to the jury to determine what to make of them
3429000 3433000 Please proceed
3433000 3439000 Mrs. Kane, please continue reading from the highlighted portion
3439000 3445000 Then I remember Sophie had another dream about her, forgot it
3445000 3450000 I almost never dreamed, what do I got to do to remember?
3450000 3455000 That's Sophie Dumont, Mr. Fleck's neighbor whom he was obsessed with
3455000 3459000 What was that date? November 17
3459000 3468000 Well, the record show, November 17th is the date of Mr. Fleck stabbed Randall Kleinman Hoffer to death
3468000 3475000 The very same day that he shot and killed Murray Frank
3475000 3482000 Now, I know it's not your area of expertise, but you have read all of Mr. Fleck's journal before, correct?
3482000 3484000 Yes, I have
3484000 3490000 And, in your opinion, does this sound like a different voice?
3490000 3496000 Like a different personality, wrote this?
3496000 3499000 No, it sounds like Arthur
3499000 3501000 Go on
3501000 3505000 He often wrote about his fantasies
3505000 3511000 And the women he had imaginary relationships with
3511000 3514000 And of course his jokes
3514000 3522000 There are always a lot of these unfunny jokes
3522000 3527000 There's justice, so I don't think she's even qualified to do that
3527000 3529000 You know, you're making him out to be a fucking idiot in there
3530000 3532000 He's never gonna get out if he keep this shit up
3532000 3535000 Ask her why she has me sitting so far away from him
3535000 3537000 Let's not do this here
3537000 3539000 Do you see all those people out front?
3539000 3541000 Who do you think they're here for?
3541000 3543000 How many T-shirts is Arthur Glenn on?
3543000 3545000 How many signs?
3545000 3550000 It's the tale of the century and she doesn't even know who her own client is
3550000 3552000 Can you see how sick he is?
3552000 3554000 How much help he needs?
3554000 3556000 He's not sick
3557000 3559000 He's perfect
3559000 3562000 You don't really think he's just gonna walk out of here, do you?
3562000 3565000 Yeah, he's gonna walk right out of here
3565000 3567000 With me by his side
3567000 3569000 And they want
3570000 3572000 And then we're gonna build him out
3572000 3574000 A what?
3574000 3575000 And a little help
3575000 3577000 What does that mean?
3581000 3583000 You're not listening
3583000 3584000 We can win in this case
3584000 3586000 And she's gonna fuck it all up
3586000 3588000 No, you're not listening
3588000 3590000 Please look now for me
3591000 3593000 She had a chance what I've been through
3593000 3595000 What are you talking about?
3595000 3597000 We're from the same neighborhood
3597000 3600000 She lost her father, you know
3600000 3602000 Her mom was awful to her
3602000 3603000 She had a commitment
3603000 3606000 So just give her a break
3607000 3610000 Okay, leave care of us about you, sure
3610000 3611000 I know
3612000 3614000 She didn't grow up in your neighborhood
3614000 3617000 She lives on the Upper West Side with her parents
3617000 3619000 Her father is not dead
3619000 3621000 He's a doctor
3621000 3624000 She voluntarily committed herself to the hospital
3624000 3626000 And then just checked herself out
3626000 3627000 When she wanted to
3627000 3629000 She didn't check herself out
3629000 3630000 Arthur
3630000 3633000 I was a bad influence on her, so they separated us
3635000 3639000 Did she mention she went to grad school for psychiatry?
3640000 3642000 You wouldn't get it
3642000 3643000 My point is
3643000 3646000 She's playing you for a fool
3647000 3649000 I'm sorry, I just
3650000 3652000 I know what it's like to love somebody
3652000 3655000 But I don't think he can believe a word she says
3663000 3665000 From MTV Studios
3666000 3668000 It's the
3668000 3669000 It's the
3669000 3670000 The
3670000 3674000 The
3680000 3682000 There's a light
3684000 3686000 I'm turning on a light
3687000 3689000 There's never a shot on me
3690000 3693000 All of the holes I've to be
3694000 3696000 Living with you
3697000 3699000 Living with you
3700000 3702000 There's a way
3704000 3706000 Everybody says
3706000 3710000 To do each and every little thing
3712000 3714000 What the dust brings
3715000 3717000 If I ain't got you
3718000 3720000 If I ain't got you
3721000 3725000 Oh you don't know what it's like
3726000 3730000 Baby you don't know what it's like
3731000 3733000 To love somebody
3734000 3736000 To love somebody
3736000 3738000 The way I love you
3739000 3742000 Baby baby baby baby baby
3742000 3745000 You don't know what it's like
3746000 3749000 Baby you don't know what
3751000 3753000 What happened?
3754000 3756000 Well you weren't even looking at me anymore
3756000 3758000 You were making it all about yourself
3759000 3763000 And the song is about loving me
3764000 3767000 Now look who's making it all about themselves
3768000 3770000 So you're saying it's not about us?
3771000 3772000 It is
3772000 3774000 But we're singing for them
3774000 3776000 That's why we're here honey
3777000 3779000 As I got the speech suspicion
3779000 3781000 That we're not giving the people what they want
3782000 3783000 It's okay baby
3783000 3784000 You're right
3786000 3788000 Let's give the people what they want
3790000 3791000 Use it
3791000 3792000 Let's take a moment to
3799000 3801000 As the honeymoon over
3804000 3806000 First night
3806000 3807000 Everything went back
3807000 3809000 If you knew what it is
3809000 3810000 Just talk to me
3811000 3812000 It's chiels
3812000 3813000 I can't look for anything
3814000 3815000 I'm in the back
3815000 3817000 I've always Braised
3817000 3818000 You don't know what to do
3818000 3819000 �
3819000 3820000 Just though
3823000 3825000 Pause
3826000 3829000 Okay
3829000 3830000 Look
3830000 3832000 I love you.
3832000 3837000 A couple of weeks back on TV and already acting like you're on the joint.
3837000 3840000 What the fuck are you two doing sitting on our bleachers?
3840000 3841000 We said they're your bleachers.
3841000 3844000 Rippy, what the fuck has gotten it to you?
3844000 3845000 You heard me.
3845000 3846000 Up.
3846000 3848000 Just so I just saw you in front.
3848000 3851000 A little lady friend.
3851000 3853000 I'm not a lady.
3853000 3854000 I'm a lady.
3854000 3855000 I'm a lady.
3855000 3856000 I'm a lady.
3856000 3857000 I'm a lady.
3857000 3858000 I'm a lady.
3858000 3861000 A little lady friend.
3861000 3863000 All right, enough. Get up, both of you.
3863000 3865000 In fact, get a visit.
3865000 3871000 You're acting like I tell you.
3871000 3873000 Moving.
3873000 3878000 Every day of the casual.
3878000 3887000 You're a fucking wack job, flack.
3887000 3889000 I'm a wack job.
3889000 3892000 I'm a wack job.
3892000 3895000 I'm a wack job.
3895000 3898000 I'm a wack job.
3898000 3901000 I'm a wack job.
3901000 3905000 I'm a wack job.
3905000 3906000 Hey.
3906000 3908000 Five minutes.
3912000 3915000 How you holding up?
3915000 3922000 Everything okay?
3922000 3929000 Did you, did you hide in me?
3929000 3934000 Sure.
3934000 3938000 I mean, everybody lies a little.
3938000 3941000 I'm a wack job.
3942000 3945000 I mean, everybody lies a little.
3945000 3951000 Maybe not from the same neighborhood as me.
3951000 3954000 Dad's a doctor.
3954000 3957000 You rich?
3957000 3960000 I just wanted you to like me.
3966000 3969000 You really checked yourself in here?
3969000 3972000 Yeah.
3972000 3979000 That's crazy.
3979000 3983000 Just because you wanted to meet me?
3983000 3986000 Just to meet you.
3989000 3992000 And you could just really let her.
3992000 3996000 Then said what? I'm nobody.
3996000 4002000 I've been done anything with my life like you have.
4002000 4007000 You really watched that TV movie made about me 20 times?
4007000 4013000 Probably more like four or five.
4013000 4016000 It wasn't actually good or do you lie about that too?
4016000 4019000 It was great.
4020000 4025000 My lawyer says you're playing me for a four.
4025000 4028000 You're in a four.
4028000 4031000 Can't you say what she's doing?
4031000 4035000 They're laughing at you in there.
4035000 4040000 She doesn't care about you.
4040000 4048000 I do.
4049000 4054000 Do you know I moved into your old apartment building to make us a home for when you get up?
4054000 4057000 Did you learn to tell you that?
4057000 4060000 You did?
4060000 4065000 I don't want to live there.
4065000 4069000 I'm pregnant.
4073000 4076000 What?
4078000 4089000 Why do birds suddenly appear?
4089000 4096000 Every time you are near.
4096000 4099000 Just like me.
4099000 4107000 They love to be close to you.
4107000 4115000 Why do stars fall down from the sky?
4115000 4121000 Every time you walk by.
4121000 4124000 Just like me.
4124000 4131000 They long to be close to you.
4132000 4144000 On the day that you were born, the angels got together and decided to make a dream come true.
4144000 4156000 So they sprinkled mondust in your hair, cold and starlight in your eyes of moon.
4156000 4169000 That is why all the girls in town follow you all around.
4169000 4172000 Just like me.
4172000 4179000 They long to be close to you.
4186000 4207000 Just like me.
4207000 4225000 They long to be close to you.
4225000 4230000 Did you think he was going to hurt you or your daughter?
4230000 4231000 I did.
4231000 4234000 Yes.
4234000 4237000 You believe he was dangerous?
4237000 4241000 He broke into my apartment.
4241000 4244000 You call it police?
4244000 4247000 No.
4247000 4257000 His mother told me that he had problems his whole life, but that he wouldn't hurt a fly.
4257000 4264000 And was the man who broke into your apartment that night?
4264000 4271000 Was he different in any way from the Arthur Fleck you and you?
4271000 4273000 I didn't really know him.
4273000 4278000 I saw him in the lobby, the elevator a few times.
4278000 4284000 Like I said, I knew his mother a little bit. She was really sweet to my daughter.
4284000 4290000 I missed your mond. Why is it that you didn't want to come here and testify today?
4290000 4294000 Why did you initially ignore our subpoenas?
4294000 4301000 Well, after Arthur did what he did, the press wanted to talk to me about it.
4301000 4307000 And then I was a character in that awful TV movie they made.
4307000 4313000 And then all these people, some foreigners I guess, like the people outside started showing up at my work.
4313000 4320000 And harassing me, blaming me for what happened to Arthur.
4320000 4325000 So I was afraid for my safety, for my daughter's safety, we moved out of the city.
4325000 4328000 Well, then why did you finally decide to comply?
4328000 4332000 I should have called the police that night.
4332000 4336000 Then maybe all those people wouldn't have been.
4336000 4340000 Maybe they wouldn't be dead now if I did.
4340000 4344000 Thank you. No more questions?
4344000 4347000 Your witness, Miss Stewart.
4347000 4356000 Miss Duman, what happened after you asked Arthur to leave your apartment bed?
4356000 4361000 He told me he was having a bad day. The name he left.
4361000 4366000 So, he never heard or even threatened your daughter?
4366000 4372000 No. And did you watch him on TV on Marie Franklin the following week?
4372000 4374000 He did.
4374000 4379000 And did that seem like the same man who was sitting in your apartment that night?
4379000 4383000 Did he sound the same or even look the same?
4383000 4388000 No, I mean, he was wearing clown makeup.
4388000 4393000 And while Arthur's mother was being so sweet to your daughter,
4393000 4397000 what was she telling you about her own son?
4403000 4411000 She told me that there was something wrong with Arthur, and that he lived in a fantasy world and that he had this laugh.
4411000 4413000 She told you it was a dumb laugh.
4413000 4418000 That's what she called it. His dumb laugh.
4418000 4420000 Yes.
4420000 4423000 What else did she tell you?
4423000 4431000 That she made up a story when he was a kid, so that he would feel better about it.
4431000 4435000 So that he would stop crying so that he wouldn't kill himself.
4435000 4441000 What was the story that he was put on this earth to bring joy?
4441000 4445000 Something like that. So I should call him happy.
4445000 4452000 And she couldn't believe that he faced his whole life around this made up story.
4452000 4457000 He was a straight clown and he wanted to be comedian.
4457000 4461000 She made fun of him for doing that.
4461000 4464000 She just thought it was ridiculous that he thought he'd make people laugh.
4464000 4467000 And she said Arthur was funny at all.
4468000 4472000 But she told you that he had been giving out a test to teach us all about it.
4479000 4483000 It's always the token.
4484000 4491000 In her pack, there's always a lonely cloud.
4492000 4499000 The poor laughing through the folds on his back.
4499000 4505000 And everyone laughs when he's down.
4505000 4512000 There's always the fun about him again.
4512000 4519000 But he's only funny by mistake.
4520000 4524000 And everyone looks at him.
4524000 4526000 Just the same.
4526000 4531000 They don't see his lonely heartbreak.
4541000 4548000 They don't care as long as they're just a fool.
4549000 4554000 As foolish as he can be.
4555000 4562000 There's always a joke about that's the rule.
4562000 4568000 But fate feels better than I seem.
4572000 4576000 The joke for me.
4579000 4586000 They don't care as long as they're just a fool.
4586000 4591000 As foolish as he can be.
4591000 4596000 There's always a joke about that's the rule.
4596000 4601000 But fate feels better than I seem.
4602000 4607000 The joke for me.
4607000 4611000 The joke for me.
4611000 4616000 The joke for me.
4632000 4636000 The joke for me.
4636000 4641000 The joke for me.
4641000 4646000 As me.
4648000 4649000 Yeah.
4649000 4652000 That he had never had a girlfriend.
4652000 4656000 And he thought he was probably his first ever.
4656000 4659000 I can't do this anymore.
4659000 4661000 Don't you want to be a pooch eventually?
4661000 4662000 No, you may not.
4662000 4664000 I want to borrow my lawyer.
4664000 4665000 Excuse me.
4665000 4667000 I'd like to represent myself.
4667000 4668000 You're fired.
4668000 4670000 Arson, let me do this.
4670000 4671000 This is fail.
4671000 4674000 You don't even believe in fail.
4674000 4676000 I'm sorry.
4676000 4677000 David.
4677000 4678000 David.
4678000 4679000 I'm sorry.
4679000 4680000 David.
4680000 4681000 David.
4681000 4682000 I'm sorry.
4682000 4683000 I'm sorry.
4683000 4684000 I'm sorry.
4684000 4685000 I'm sorry.
4685000 4686000 I'm sorry.
4686000 4687000 I'm sorry.
4687000 4689000 I'm sorry.
4689000 4693000 I'm sorry.
4693000 4695000 David.
4697000 4699000 It's great.
4699000 4701000 Thank you.
4705000 4707000 Hey, go touchy.
4707000 4710000 I'm so fucking proud of you.
4710000 4719000 You should see it out there. They're all going crazy for you.
4719000 4724000 You did it.
4724000 4731000 I know. We've asked you to read a walk or something.
4731000 4735000 You know I never went to a first school.
4735000 4745000 I said no touching.
4745000 4752000 You can do anything you want. You're Joker.
4765000 4775000 You're a good guy.
4775000 4780000 Good evening. It's 40 degrees at 6 o'clock on this Wednesday, November 8.
4780000 4783000 I'm Stan L. Brooks and here's what's happening.
4783000 4787000 Chocking developments at the trial of Arthur Fleck downtown today.
4787000 4791000 Fleck the accused killer, also known as Joker, interrupted testimony
4791000 4794000 in the court.
4794000 4797000 Then he kissed her goodbye.
4797000 4801000 Afterward Fleck was extensively questioned by Judge Herman Rothwax.
4801000 4807000 The right of self representation is not a license to abuse the dignity of the courtroom.
4807000 4810000 You can hear all your emotions, Mr. Fleck.
4810000 4815000 Judge Rothwax reluctantly approved Fleck's request to represent himself.
4815000 4819000 As long as he agreed to stand by counsel, a decision that both Fleck's now
4819000 4823000 and his report and assistant DA Harvey Dent disagree with.
4823000 4829000 It's really tragic. Arthur believes he has all of these supporters, but they don't care about him.
4829000 4832000 They care about Joker.
4832000 4836000 He is not dealing with reality. He's mentally ill.
4836000 4840000 It just convinced him it got him, but would have won this case.
4840000 4843000 Fleck knows what he's doing. He knows he's losing.
4843000 4845000 We can't look at it.
4845000 4846000 He's a kid.
4846000 4848000 It's almost like Arthur's flying.
4848000 4853000 He has a little bit of a try on the most of the month, but he's weird.
4853000 4856000 Very weird.
4856000 4860000 Hey, sit down.
4860000 4863000 Sit down.
4863000 4867000 Hey, hey, hey.
4867000 4869000 Hey, hey, hey.
4869000 4870000 Hey, hey, hey.
4870000 4873000 Oh, when they say take a fuck out, record.
4873000 4877000 Oh, when they say take a fuck out, record.
4877000 4881000 Oh, when they say take a fuck out, record.
4881000 4885000 I'm gonna have to get in a hot, win the same thing.
4885000 4889000 I'm gonna have to get out.
4889000 4892000 Get out.
4892000 4894000 All right, so's over.
4894000 4896000 Hell, no.
4896000 4899000 And the same thing for our game.
4899000 4901000 One, two, three.
4901000 4903000 So far, it's the same.
4903000 4905000 One, two, three.
4905000 4907000 One, two, three.
4907000 4910000 Oh, my God, the same thing for our game.
4910000 4913000 And the same.
4913000 4915000 One, two, three.
4915000 4918000 No, no, no, no.
4918000 4921000 No, no, no, no.
4921000 4924000 No, no, no, no, no.
4924000 4926000 No, no, no.
4926000 4943000 After reviewing all the case law that offers precedent, Jensen versus Superior Court being
4943000 4950000 the most relevant, I've reluctantly decided that Mr. Fleck does have the right as an
4950000 4956000 attorney to dress himself how he likes as long as he doesn't cause disorder or
4956000 4962000 interfere with the functioning of the court. I will not allow this proceeding to become
4962000 4968000 as unruly as it is outside and I will not let you turn this into any more of a
4968000 4977000 circus than you already have. Mr. Dent, call your next witness.
4977000 4982000 The state calls Gary Puddles.
4982000 4988000 Beleth, you please escort Mr. Puddles to the stat.
5018000 5045000 Please raise your right hand. You solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give
5045000 5052000 is the whole truth and nothing but the truth to help you God.
5052000 5058000 Good morning Mr. Puddles. Thank you for being here.
5058000 5068000 It's one last question sir. The person who you saw stabbed Randall Kleinman Hoffer to death.
5068000 5073000 Are they in this courtroom here today? Yes.
5073000 5080000 Can you point them out to all of us and describe this clothing?
5080000 5087000 You said right there at the table wearing a red suit and clown makeup.
5087000 5093000 May the record reflect the identification of the accused, Your Honor.
5093000 5099000 Yes it will. Nothing further, Your Honor.
5099000 5103000 Your witness Mr. Flack.
5109000 5117000 Mr. Puddles. Gary Puddles?
5117000 5123000 Tell me sir, is that your God given name?
5123000 5124000 Yes.
5124000 5130000 Hey, Billy, your last name is Puddles.
5130000 5136000 Why sounds like a joke.
5136000 5138000 Well it's not.
5138000 5143000 You expect us to believe that your last name is Puddles. Puddles?
5143000 5146000 Mr. Flack, where is this going?
5146000 5151000 As I said, I'm not going to let you turn my courtroom into a circus.
5151000 5157000 Okay, but with all the respect your holding on, you think it's a little late?
5157000 5160000 Don't try my patience.
5162000 5165000 Mr. Puddles.
5165000 5175000 This afternoon you testified that you saw me stab Mr. Kleinmanman Hoff in the neck a couple of tops. Correct?
5176000 5180000 Kleinman Hoff, yes, I saw you.
5180000 5185000 Mm, and what else did you see that day?
5185000 5194000 You're stabbing him in the eye and blessing his head into the wall many, many times.
5194000 5200000 Yes, but Randall was a bit of a bully wasn't he?
5200000 5203000 Didn't this end, Don?
5204000 5206000 No.
5206000 5208000 Never mind.
5208000 5213000 Gary, did you catch my ass on the lorry-freitling show later that time?
5213000 5215000 No, I didn't.
5215000 5216000 No?
5216000 5220000 But I remind you that you were under oath.
5220000 5224000 I was locked up at the police station in an interview room.
5224000 5228000 So I thought you might come and kill me.
5228000 5232000 I was there, they went there, they kept me there all night.
5233000 5236000 Isn't that cone beaming, Mr. Puddles?
5236000 5237000 You didn't see the show?
5237000 5238000 You didn't see anything?
5238000 5240000 I had to say, I can't believe it.
5240000 5245000 Mr. Fleck, okay.
5245000 5250000 When you were in my mama's apartment, God rest your soul.
5250000 5260000 When as you say you saw me, bass Mr. Kleinman, whatever's heading to the wall many, many times,
5260000 5263000 did I seem crazy to you?
5263000 5274000 Did I seem like a different person or was I the same old joker that I own?
5274000 5278000 Oh, so don't do this to yourself, it isn't you.
5278000 5280000 It isn't me.
5280000 5282000 So you don't think this is me?
5282000 5287000 Or maybe, maybe it can really was.
5288000 5290000 But I'm inside of it.
5290000 5294000 So maybe you want a million, maybe no one was.
5294000 5298000 Because nobody knew I existed.
5298000 5304000 But look around, look at all these people, everyone outside, these cameras.
5304000 5309000 Who do you think they see, Mr. Puddles?
5309000 5311000 Joker.
5312000 5324000 Oh, sweet child, what you are proving here today is that you are no different than any of those people that underestimated me.
5324000 5333000 From Murray Franklin to those goddamn fat stupid girls in awesome, I think that they could treat me like trash.
5333000 5339000 But I will no longer allow you or you or you or any of you to keep me down.
5340000 5342000 I am free!
5346000 5349000 Why are you doing this to me, Arthur?
5349000 5350000 What?
5350000 5352000 Gary, I like you.
5352000 5355000 I told you I wouldn't hurt you and I didn't.
5355000 5357000 Not hurt me.
5357000 5361000 I couldn't go back to work.
5361000 5363000 I still can't sleep.
5363000 5366000 I'm scared all the time.
5366000 5369000 I never used to be scared.
5369000 5371000 I'm scared right now, here.
5371000 5375000 It's you in front of me.
5375000 5378000 I couldn't do anything that day.
5378000 5382000 I felt so small.
5382000 5387000 It was reminding me how powerless I really am.
5387000 5390000 Oh, you got a flare for the dramatic.
5390000 5394000 You're tugging at my heartstrings, little Gary.
5397000 5400000 No more questions, Harlan?
5400000 5404000 Do you know what that feels like, Arthur?
5404000 5409000 You were the only one at work who never made fun of me.
5409000 5414000 You were the only one who was nice to me.
5414000 5421000 I said, no more questions, Harlan.
5421000 5424000 Very well, Mr. Post.
5424000 5427000 I never thanked you for your testimony.
5427000 5430000 Please step down, you're excused.
5430000 5448000 Mr. Dent, call your next witness.
5448000 5451000 We're not calling anymore witnesses, your Honor.
5451000 5453000 That is the state's case.
5453000 5455000 The state rest.
5455000 5457000 Very well.
5457000 5459000 All right, Mr. Fleck.
5459000 5465000 At this point, you may mount your defense.
5465000 5468000 The defense rest is very, Your Honor.
5468000 5470000 Are you?
5470000 5474000 Mr. Fleck, you don't want to put on any defense.
5474000 5477000 No, Your Honor, the defense rest.
5477000 5480000 No, no, no, no, no. That's all, folks.
5480000 5482000 All right, all right.
5482000 5484000 All right.
5484000 5490000 That's enough. This is the court of law.
5490000 5493000 Both sides having rested.
5493000 5497000 This court will recess until tomorrow morning at 9.30.
5497000 5499000 Man, I'm too short of it.
5499000 5500000 What about the idiot?
5500000 5502000 You're gonna fight with your myself.
5502000 5504000 They gotta stop it?
5504000 5505000 No, they don't get down everywhere!
5505000 5510000 And they'll stop it here once a year?
5510000 5512000 They got in there, right back?
5512000 5514000 They don't get down away.
5514000 5515000 That's enough.
5515000 5517000 It's really when they chain up your defense.
5517000 5518000 What's with this role?
5518000 5520000 Be careful, you just don't get up there.
5520000 5522000 No, I want to increase the force faster.
5522000 5523000 I want to make a difference.
5523000 5525000 Now, for six.
5525000 5527000 You press the cover.
5527000 5530000 Well, you know that every stop DNA is going to Mauiplier now.
5530000 5531000 We're gonna move forward.
5531000 5539000 They start, oh, I will
5539000 5544000 Gonna build a mountain
5544000 5550000 Gonna build a night
5552000 5557000 I don't know how we're gonna do it
5557000 5562000 Only know I could not try
5566000 5568000 Gonna build a so heavy
5568000 5570000 From a little hell
5570000 5573000 Gonna build a so heavy
5573000 5575000 And I know long way out

6001000 6005000 thin
6005000 6023000 I've got the world on a stream, said no in a rainbow,
6023000 6029000 thought that string around my finger,
6029000 6038000 what a world, what a life I'm in love.
6038000 6045000 I've got a song that I sing, I can make the rainbow,
6045000 6058000 anytime I move my finger, lucky me, can't you see I'm in love?
6058000 6069000 Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold that string,
6069000 6082000 I'd be a silly, so I'm sore, if I should ever let it go.
6082000 6089000 I've got the world on a stream, in love, said no in a rainbow,
6089000 6098000 thought that string around my finger, what a world.
6098000 6105000 Yeah, there ain't no other girl that I need.
6105000 6118000 Roll, roll, roll, roll, light, hey, now I'm falling down.
6118000 6122000 Mr. Plight, your closing statement.
6128000 6155000 A word of caution, this is not a comedy club, you are not on stage.
6155000 6180000 Excuse me.
6180000 6201000 You need a short recess, sir.
6201000 6226000 I'm not on stage, I'm not on stage, I'm not on stage,
6226000 6233000 I can't do this anymore, because I can't be, are you want me to be?
6233000 6245000 It was all just a fantasy.
6245000 6258000 There is no joke of it, it's just me.
6258000 6269000 I killed six people, I wish I didn't, but I did.
6269000 6287000 Nobody knows, but I also killed my mother, but I'm tall over her face, and smother her dead.
6287000 6297000 I just want to blow it all up, and start a new life.
6317000 6338000 Not, not, who's there?
6338000 6343000 What the fuck?
6343000 6348000 All right, there's a fuck, who?
6348000 6365000 He is probably leaving left to death a beam, and left your reporter, and which case you can just fuck off. Thanks.
6365000 6370000 Hi, it's me, Arthur.
6370000 6382000 The jury's already come back with a verdict, to about less than an hour, so, you know,
6382000 6389000 I didn't let me call you to see if you'd come back, because I want you here.
6389000 6396000 And then we need to go.
6396000 6418000 If you go away from a sunny day, and you might as well take us on away, all the birds that flew, and the bright blue sky,
6418000 6432000 when our love was new, and our hearts were bright, and the day was young, and then I was long,
6432000 6439000 and I'm a little bit stressed still, but the night bright's on.
6440000 6459000 If you go away, but if you stay, I'll make you a day like no day has been, or we'll be again, or out of the rain,
6459000 6473000 we'll sail on your touch, I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much, and if you go, go I won't cry,
6474000 6494000 all the good is gone, and the world could find you away, and get the power of going.
6494000 6500000 And so we will now take as we wait to hear the word and do a trial of our peace, and I think it will be the first time.
6500000 6519000 If you go away, as I know you are, there'll be nothing left, and the world will all be lost, just to empty,
6519000 6531000 all of these days, at the empty home, I'll sail on your face,
6531000 6545000 I'll live in the shadow of your dark, I'll talk it, I'll get me, not inside.
6549000 6554000 Go away.
6554000 6563000 As a reminder, regardless of the verdict, I will not tolerate any outbursts of any kind.
6563000 6569000 For a person, you may begin.
6569000 6578000 In the matter of the people of the state of New York versus author flick, case number GC07193.
6578000 6591000 As to count one, we the jury find author flick guilty as charged with murder in the first degree against Maurice Franklin, so say we all.
6591000 6604000 As to count two, we the jury find author flick guilty as charged with murder in the second degree against Randall Klimann Hopper, so say we all.
6604000 6617000 As to count three, we the jury find author flick guilty as charged with murder in the second degree against Randall Klimann Hopper, so say we all.
6617000 6621000 Go away.
6621000 6625000 Stand down.
6625000 6627000 Hey, let's get them out of here.

7142000 7145000 That's not true.
7145000 7150000 In all that we had dreamed,
7150000 7160000 That's entertainment.
7160000 7163000 Goodbye, Arthur.
7180000 7183000 Don't you?
7183000 7186000 Is it not?
7186000 7190000 Come, my little bit of a brainer.
7190000 7194000 I will end you.
7195000 7198000 Don't you? Is it not?
7198000 7200000 Come, my little bit of a brainer.
7200000 7203000 I will end you.
7203000 7208000 Oh, I'm all going to do.
7208000 7213000 It is true.
7213000 7216000 Thank you.
7216000 7219000 Thank you.
7219000 7222000 Oh, my God.
7222000 7225000 I'm coming.
7225000 7230000 Nice shot, Arthur.
7230000 7232000 What? Let's go.
7232000 7235000 We got a visitor.
7235000 7240000 No phone.
7240000 7243000 No phone.
7243000 7248000 No phone.
7249000 7254000 Let's go.
7254000 7259000 Hey, Arthur.
7259000 7264000 Hold up.
7264000 7268000 Can I tell you a joke I came up with?
7268000 7271000 Is it quick?
7271000 7275000 Yeah, I can make it quick.
7275000 7281000 So, a psychopath walks into a bar and sees this famous clown sitting there, all alone.
7281000 7283000 Totally drunk, it's pathetic.
7283000 7286000 I can't believe you're here, he says.
7286000 7288000 What a disappointment.
7288000 7292000 I used to watch you on TV.
7292000 7294000 What can I get you?
7294000 7297000 And this clown turns and says,
7297000 7302000 Well, if you're buying you can get me anything.
7302000 7303000 Perfect.
7303000 7308000 Psychopath says, how about I get you what you fucking deserve?
