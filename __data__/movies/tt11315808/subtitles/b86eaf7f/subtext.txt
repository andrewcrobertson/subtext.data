448049 451886 This guy's dog dies, right?<br />And he really loved this dog.
452720 457124 So, he goes down to the church,<br />and he asks Father Mulcahy
457158 459827 if he'd perform<br />a funeral for him. Right?
460127 463564 And Mulcahy says, "Oh, no.<br />[stammering] I'm sorry my son,
463597 466801 we can't have a service<br />for an animal in our church.
466834 468669 Uh, but, I bet if you go down
468703 470871 -to the veterinarian in town..."<br />-[barber] Fuck.
470905 472239 [Jackie] "...he can do it<br />for you. You see?"
472273 474041 [barber] Goddamn it, Arthur.
474075 476577 [Jackie] Uh, so the guy says,<br />"Oh, thanks very much, Father."
476610 479246 And he says,<br />"Do you think two grand
479280 481182 would be enough<br />to cover the service?"
482750 484618 Father Mulcahy looks at him...
485686 488589 "Why didn't you tell me<br />the dog was Catholic?"
488956 491692 [all laughing]
491726 492927 [razor clattering]

645813 646847 Remember her?
648215 650017 She's gonna be<br />videotaping you this time,
650050 653220 so we can show it at your<br />competency hearing next week.
653254 655856 -[guards chuckling faintly]<br />-And if they find you competent,
655890 657892 and they will, they always do,
657925 659793 then we're going to trial.
661028 666033 You need to be in an actual<br />hospital with actual doctors.
667234 669403 Not this<br />Department of Corrections...
669436 671672 bullshit with these thugs.
673941 676477 Dr. Beatty thinks<br />that with everything
676511 678946 that happened to you<br />in your childhood,
678979 681048 it caused a split...
682750 686120 -this fragmentation in you...<br />-[thunder rumbling]
686153 688022 ...to help you cope<br />with your pain.
688889 693427 She believes you have another<br />person living inside of you.
693460 698365 And it was this other person<br />who committed those crimes.
700434 702870 Do you understand<br />what that means, Arthur?

783350 784852 [Arthur] Mm...
789223 790057 Okay.
794028 795496 How about Murray Franklin?
797998 799900 What, if anything, do you<br />remember about that night?
807374 808475 <i>The music.</i>
811445 813914 [Dr. Beatty] <i>That's good.</i><br /><i>Arthur, that is good.</i>
816584 818485 Can I tell you what I remember<br />about that night?
820254 824224 I remember you came out<br />dressed as Joker.
825926 829897 And I remember Joker<br />was dancing to that music.
830632 831566 <i>Right?</i>
834301 836103 <i>I really liked his band.</i>
838072 842343 <i>My mom and I u-- used</i><br /><i>to watch the show together.</i>

854988 856290 Is that your mother's voice?
857024 858325 [Arthur] Mm.

863364 864666 [thunder rumbles faintly]
864699 866333 [chuckles weakly]
866367 868603 [Dr. Beatty] Did it change<br />at all after she died?
869704 871171 What does that mean?
871673 872906 Did you...
874709 876477 this other part of you...
877945 879413 Joker...
880147 882617 Did it come out more<br />after she died?
882650 885352 You lived together, right?<br />In a one-bedroom apartment?
888656 891258 [cigarette crackling faintly]
891291 893427 Maybe I could talk to Joker<br />about it.
895396 896930 Would he like to talk to me?

973808 975342 Why not.
975375 976778 Oh, no, no, no.<br />What are you doing?
976811 979046 He doesn't get a cigarette<br />unless he tells a joke.
979079 981114 No, come on. He still<br />makes us laugh, doesn't he?
981148 983116 [younger guard scoffs] Barely.

992125 994995 I got you in.<br />We're going next week.
995462 997231 [younger guard] Bullshit.
997264 999767 -The fuck you do that for?<br />-Eh, eh. No, no.

1006674 1008510 Yeah.
1008543 1011044 He knows he can get<br />some good press for it.
1011078 1013247 Plus, I told him<br />I'd go along with him.

1314447 1316851 I set fire to my parents'<br />apartment building.

1320855 1321889 Actually...
1323658 1324725 ...it was six.
1326093 1328062 Nobody knows,<br />but also I killed my mother.
1328095 1329664 [chuckles lightly]
1331431 1332800 I should have done that.
1333601 1335536 My mother had me committed.
1335837 1337505 She says I'm psychotic.
1340575 1342375 You know, I must've watched<br />that TV movie

1347982 1349817 They won't let me watch it.
1349851 1350918 It was good.
1352186 1353754 It was really good.
1354589 1356524 I grew up<br />in the same neighborhood.
1356557 1358425 Me and my friends<br />used to take that staircase
1358458 1360127 to school every day.
1360995 1363164 My parents didn't<br />give a fuck about me either.
1363197 1365099 My father beat the shit<br />out of me.
1368669 1370437 Well, guess what?
1370470 1371939 "Knock, knock."

2516684 2519186 and what the conditions<br />are really like in this place.

2526627 2527695 And about herself.
2528362 2529663 Good.

2535870 2538072 Two minutes. Paddy's ready.
2539006 2540241 Arthur.
2541510 2544145 This is a chance for you to show<br />a different side of yourself.
2545212 2548916 So the public can see<br />who you really are.
2548949 2550217 And I don't think<br />you should smoke.
2550251 2552686 I think it makes you<br />look cavalier.
2552720 2553687 Okay.
2553721 2555823 We need to use this time
2555856 2558659 to show people<br />that you're human.
2559727 2562997 They need to understand<br />you were sick. Delusional.
2563030 2564365 Mm-hm.
2564398 2568302 You're not Joker.<br />You're Arthur Fleck.

2591125 2592893 [lighter clicks]
2592927 2598099 So, uh... you want me<br />to call you Arthur or The Joker?
2598132 2600101 Mr. Meyers,<br />you know we have an agreement.
2600134 2601969 You can't call him "Joker."
2602002 2604205 It's Arthur. Arthur Fleck.

2657191 2659360 <i>is sitting down</i><br /><i>for his first interview</i>
2659393 2662363 <i>since that infamous night</i><br /><i>on</i> Murray Franklin.
2662396 2665933 <i>And yes, we all know</i><br /><i>how that turned out.</i>
2665966 2667334 [sharp laugh]
2669270 2671739 -[Arthur clears throat]<br />-Arthur Fleck, welcome.
2672239 2673374 Hello.
2674576 2678212 Take me back to that night<br />onstage with Murray Franklin.
2679113 2682116 What was going<br />through your mind...
2682149 2684685 when you pulled out that gun<br />and blew his brains out?
2688455 2691258 Well, Paddy, um...
2694862 2697965 I was going through a lot<br />back then. Um...
2697998 2702069 I don't really remember much<br />from that night. I, uh...
2702102 2705005 blacked out,<br />I saw bright lights.
2705039 2707441 <i>I was having a hard time</i>
2707474 2710044 <i>knowing the difference</i><br /><i>between what was real or not.</i>
2710077 2711212 [Paddy] <i>Oh, please.</i>
2711245 2713480 You did it on live TV, pal.
2713515 2714982 Doesn't get any more real<br />than that.
2716417 2718219 Paddy, all I remember<br />from that night
2718252 2720387 is I was gonna kill myself.
2720421 2722056 On television.
2722990 2725826 I thought Murray<br />was playing a part in my show.
2726927 2728495 But he was a bad actor.
2728530 2730898 So he got what he deserved.
2731265 2733867 Your last joke,<br />if we can call it a joke,
2733901 2735537 "You get<br />what you bleeping deserve."
2735570 2736837 That's what you said.
2736870 2739440 That's not fun,<br />that's not funny.
2739473 2742476 You're right, I...<br />I should have told a better one.
2744311 2745879 You're trying to be funny now?
2746447 2747281 No.
2749917 2752820 Do you deserve to die?
2753153 2755022 The DA is calling<br />for the death penalty.
2755055 2757358 You just said that you wanted<br />to kill yourself on TV.
2757391 2758359 So, tell us...
2759561 2761529 ...you still wanna die?
2762997 2766267 Well, at the time, it certainly<br />seemed a lot easier than living.
2766967 2770237 Um, but that's...<br />that's not me anymore.
2770271 2771305 That's not...
2772574 2773807 That's not who I am.
2773841 2774975 That wasn't really you.
2775009 2776143 [stammering]<br />No, that's not right.
2776176 2777444 Let me get this straight.
2777478 2779547 -That's not what I meant.<br />-So your defense is,
2779581 2781516 "It was The Joker who did it."
2781549 2783350 -An insanity defense.<br />-Okay, I don't--
2783384 2784885 I don't know about a defense.
2784918 2787221 That this alternate personality,
2787254 2790491 this killer clown in you<br />killed Murray.
2790525 2793394 Who am I speaking to now?<br />Which one of you is here?
2793427 2796463 The poor, low IQ Arthur Fleck?
2796497 2798932 Or The Joker, who goaded<br />a bunch of no-good punks--
2798966 2800501 Do you really care?
2801368 2802504 You don't.
2803538 2805339 You're just like Murray.
2805372 2807975 You're just like everyone.<br />You want sensationalism.
2808008 2809209 You don't care about...
2809243 2811378 You just wanna talk<br />about my mistakes.
2811412 2812980 You wanna talk about the things<br />that I did in the past.
2813013 2814315 Not about who I am now.
2814348 2816450 Not how I'm different now.
2818252 2821288 That's what we should be<br />talking about, Paddy.
2822956 2824425 Okay, okay.
2825527 2827562 -We should take a break.<br />-We're not taking a break.
2827595 2828829 [Paddy] <i>All right.</i>
2829830 2835570 Okay, so, tell us...<br />what's changed, Arthur?
2836571 2839340 Well, I'll tell you<br />what's changed, Paddy.
2840441 2842544 I'm not alone anymore.
2843678 2845379 Right.
2845412 2849249 The girl who was singing.<br />The night you tried to escape.

2855089 2857291 You two put on<br />quite a performance that night.
2857324 2858459 [Arthur] Aww...

2863598 2865099 You tell me.
2865533 2867401 I mean,<br />don't you think it's all...

3405606 3409644 It's my view that there is<br />absolutely no evidence
3409677 3413214 that Arthur Fleck suffers from<br />multiple personality disorder.
3413247 3417919 Or that he ever behaved<br />in the role of "Joker,"
3417952 3422924 as a separate personality<br />dissociated from himself.
3423691 3425793 [Dent] Doctor, in your opinion,
3425826 3428596 concerning the work<br />you did on this case,
3428629 3433734 do you believe Mr. Fleck suffers<br />from a mental disease or defect?
3433768 3436504 [doctor] No. In my opinion,
3436537 3441509 he's not psychotic<br />or unable to test reality.
3441542 3444512 I think he was sane<br />when he committed these crimes.
3444912 3448916 In fact, I believe he fakes<br />his mental illness.
3448950 3450918 [people murmuring]
3450952 3452019 [judge] Quiet.
3452620 3454822 [gavel rapping]
3455256 3457825 And... if he's, uh...
3459260 3461494 ...faking it, as you say,
3462563 3463965 then what is your opinion
3463998 3467535 on the defendant's<br />mental condition?
3467568 3470071 I believe he has<br />four relatively minor
3470104 3472974 and quite common<br />mental disorders
3473007 3476744 that involve<br />long-standing sadness,
3476777 3480982 narcissistic self-centeredness,<br />friendlessness,
3481015 3483784 an indifference<br />to the feelings of others.
3483818 3486287 This is<br />a very disturbed individual.
3486320 3491525 But I can't give you any kind<br />of psychiatric defense for him.
3491826 3493594 Thank you, Doctor Liu.
3494996 3496263 Nothing further, Your Honor.
3498299 3499967 [judge]<br />Your witness, Ms. Stewart.
3500735 3501535 Thank you.
3504105 3506841 Doctor Liu, good morning.
3506874 3507908 [doctor] Morning.
3509577 3511278 How long did you interview<br />Arthur Fleck for?
3511712 3513047 About two hours.
3513080 3514615 About two hours.
3515783 3517585 It was actually 89 minutes.
3518786 3521822 Tell me,<br />how can you say for certain,
3521856 3524058 that Arthur isn't mentally ill?
3524859 3528129 How can you be so sure<br />after just 89 minutes,
3528162 3530698 that this "Joker"
3530731 3534902 isn't a distinctly separate<br />and split personality from him?
3534935 3537271 That that's not who he is.
3537304 3540808 Well, I also reviewed<br />all the test results.
3540841 3545713 Psychological tests,<br />neurological and medical tests.
3545746 3548816 And in my view,<br />it's just a performance.
3548849 3549984 [crowd murmurs]
3550017 3551585 [Ms. Stewart]<br />Did you read the records
3551619 3553721 from the<br />Department of Social Services...
3554922 3558793 ...that show that when Arthur<br />was seven years old,
3558826 3560895 they returned him<br />to his abuser's home?
3562897 3565199 -His mother's home.<br />-[pen scratching]
3565232 3567234 [doctor] I did, yes.
3568302 3571305 [Ms. Stewart] And when you<br />interviewed him for 89 minutes,
3572273 3575076 did you ask him<br />why Social Services
3575109 3577745 didn't believe<br />the horrific stories
3577778 3580748 a seven-year-old boy told them
3580781 3583651 about the physical<br />and sexual abuse he suffered?
3583684 3585186 [faint, echoing laughter]
3588022 3591058 No, I...<br />I didn't ask him about that.
3591092 3592927 [Ms. Stewart] Hmm.
3592960 3595796 So you want us to believe,
3596797 3602069 that after spending just<br />89 minutes with Arthur Fleck,
3602103 3606273 and reading through<br />his records and tests
3606307 3609944 from the same government<br />agencies that abandoned him,
3609977 3611779 you want us to believe
3611812 3615249 that you can say<br />with absolute certainty
3615282 3619887 that Arthur doesn't suffer<br />from any serious mental illness?
3620855 3624125 That he didn't need<br />to retreat into fantasy
3624158 3626827 and create another identity
3626861 3632933 to protect that scared,<br />vulnerable, seven-year-old boy
3632967 3635970 from all the trauma and abuse<br />he suffered?
3636971 3640674 And that that identity<br />didn't come out again,
3640875 3643878 when he was<br />attacked and tormented
3643911 3647148 by three drunk bullies<br />on the subway?
3647481 3649450 [three loud, echoing gunshots]
3649483 3651418 [gun clicking]
3651452 3653387 <i>"After I woke up this morning,</i>

3673841 3675242 to Mr. Fleck's journals--
3675276 3676911 But these are my own<br />personal private jokes.
3676944 3678045 They weren't meant<br />to be read out loud.
3678078 3679780 -Mr. Fleck. Quiet!<br />-[gavel bangs]
3679813 3681282 [faint feedback squeal]
3681315 3684118 [judge] These are your words<br />she's reading.
3684151 3685286 And it's up to the jury
3685319 3687054 to determine<br />what to make of them.
3689790 3690991 Please proceed.
3692527 3694461 Ms. Kane,<br />please continue reading
3694495 3697164 from the, uh...<br />the highlighted portion.
3698232 3700267 "Then I remember Sophie.
3700868 3703137 Had another dream about her.<br />Forgot it.
3704338 3706473 <i>I almost never dream.</i>
3706508 3709043 What do I gotta do to remember?"
3709076 3711478 [Dent] That's Sophie Dumond,<br />Mr. Fleck's neighbor,
3711513 3713847 whom he was obsessed with.
3713881 3714715 What was that date?
3715517 3717151 November 17.
3718419 3720754 Let the record show,
3720788 3723857 November 17th<br />is the day that Mr. Fleck
3723891 3726493 stabbed Randall Kleinmanhoffer<br />to death.
3727494 3733467 The very same day that he shot<br />and killed Murray Franklin.
3734501 3738806 Now, I know it's not<br />your area of expertise,
3738839 3740040 but you have read all of
3740074 3742076 Mr. Fleck's journal before,<br />correct?
3742109 3743410 [Mrs. Kane] Yes, I have.
3743444 3746247 And in your opinion,
3746280 3749817 does this sound<br />like a different voice?
3750851 3755189 Like a different, uh...<br />personality wrote this?
3756991 3758392 No, it sounds like Arthur.
3759326 3761128 [Dent] Go on.
3761161 3764131 He often wrote about<br />his fantasies.
3765966 3771071 And... the... women he had<br />imaginary relationships with.
3772339 3775442 <i>And of course, his jokes.</i>
3775476 3779880 <i>There were always</i><br /><i>a lot of... these...</i>
3779913 3782116 <i>these unfunny jokes.</i>
3782149 3784218 -[crowd laughing]<br />-[gavel banging]
3784251 3785486 [Ms. Stewart]<br />She's just a social worker.
3785520 3787354 I don't think<br />she's even qualified--
3787388 3789356 You know, you're making him out<br />to be a fucking idiot in there.
3789390 3790858 [reporters clamoring]
3790891 3793260 He's never gonna get out<br />if you keep this shit up.
3793294 3795829 Ask her why she has me<br />sitting so far away from him.
3796430 3798232 Let's not do this here. Please?
3798265 3800134 Do you see<br />all those people out front?
3800167 3801869 Who do you think<br />they're here for?
3801902 3803837 How many T-shirts<br />is Arthur Fleck on?
3804905 3806508 How many signs?
3806541 3808008 It's the Trial of the Century
3808042 3810512 and she doesn't even know<br />who her own client is.
3810545 3813113 -What do you mean by that?<br />-Can't you see how sick he is?
3813147 3815049 How much help he needs?
3815617 3817217 He's not sick.
3818586 3820354 He's perfect.
3820387 3821922 You don't really think<br />he's just gonna
3821955 3823924 walk out of here, do you?
3823957 3825926 [Lee] Yeah, he's gonna walk<br />right outta here.
3826427 3828896 -With me by his side.<br />-[reporter] And then what?
3830164 3832166 [reporter 2]<br />Any further statements?
3832199 3834134 And then we're gonna<br />build a mountain.
3834168 3836538 -[reporter 3] A what?<br />-From a little hill.
3836571 3839340 -[reporters clamoring]<br />-What does that even mean?
3839373 3840874 -Are you going to get married?<br />-Move!
3843143 3844512 [Ms. Stewart]<br />You're not listening.
3844546 3847081 We can win this case,<br />and she's gonna fuck it all up.
3847114 3849416 No, you're not listening.
3849450 3851185 Lee's looking out for me.
3851218 3853253 [helicopter whirring outside]
3853287 3855422 She understands<br />what I've been through.
3855456 3857157 What are you talking about?
3857592 3860127 We're from<br />the same neighborhood.
3860160 3864331 She lost her father. You know...<br />her mom was awful to her.
3864365 3865966 She had her committed.
3865999 3868335 So just give her a break.
3869671 3872306 Okay, Lee cares about you, sure.
3872339 3873907 I know.
3874408 3876477 But she didn't grow up<br />in your neighborhood.
3876511 3879581 She lives on the Upper West Side<br />with her parents.
3879614 3882916 Her father is not dead,<br />he's a doctor.
3883450 3885252 She voluntarily<br />committed herself
3885285 3886453 to the hospital,
3886487 3888288 and then just<br />checked herself out
3888322 3889456 when she wanted to.
3889490 3891325 She didn't check herself out.
3891358 3893093 Arthur.
3893127 3895530 I was a bad influence on her,<br />so they separated us.
3898332 3901435 Did she mention she went<br />to grad school for psychiatry?
3901468 3904506 [giggling] You wouldn't get it.
3905339 3909076 My point is she's playing you<br />for a fool.
3910512 3912146 I'm sorry, I just--
3913581 3916150 I know what it's like<br />to love somebody.
3916183 3918586 But I don't think you can<br />believe a word she says.

4108576 4112179 Couple of weeks back on TV<br />and already acting<br />like you own the joint.
4112212 4114549 What the fuck are you two doing<br />sitting on our bleachers?
4114582 4116483 Who said they're your bleachers?
4116517 4118886 Ricky, what the fuck<br />has gotten into you?
4119654 4121656 [bearded guard]<br />You heard me. Up.
4122356 4123891 Guess who I just saw out front?
4125693 4127194 Your little lady friend.
4128696 4130732 All right, enough.<br />Get up, both of you.
4130765 4132900 [younger guard]<br />Hey, Fleck, you got a visitor.
4136436 4138205 See, Arthur? What'd I tell ya?
4140207 4141341 [older guard] Move it!
4141375 4142910 [mimics gunshots]

4174942 4176243 [younger guard] Five minutes.
4181248 4182517 How are you holding up?
4183751 4185687 [sighs]
4190323 4191859 [lighter clicks]
4194428 4196229 Is everything okay?
4202870 4205205 Did you-- Did you lie to me?
4209010 4210645 Sure.
4211411 4213280 I mean, everybody lies a little.
4217552 4220420 And you're not from<br />the same neighborhood as me?
4220454 4222590 [chuckling] And your...<br />your dad's a doctor?
4223691 4224792 You're rich?
4226928 4228830 I just wanted you to like me.
4235570 4237471 Did you really<br />check yourself in here?
4238940 4240407 [chuckling] Yeah.
4241509 4243343 [giggling]
4244746 4246413 That's crazy.
4248816 4252520 Just... because you wanted<br />to meet me?
4253320 4254689 Just to meet you.
4259326 4261596 You could have just<br />wrote me a letter.
4261629 4262964 [chuckles]
4262997 4266266 And said what? I'm nobody.
4266934 4269137 I haven't done anything<br />with my life like you have.
4273007 4274709 Did you really watch<br />that TV movie
4274742 4276811 they made about me 20 times?
4276844 4279747 Um... probably more like<br />four or five.
4279781 4281314 [chuckles]
4284819 4286821 Was it actually good,<br />or did you lie about that too?
4287121 4288723 It was great.
4293795 4295563 [murmurs, exhales]
4296597 4300601 My lawyer... says you're<br />playing me for a fool.
4301869 4303571 I'm no fool.
4305106 4307440 Can't you see what she's doing?
4307942 4309710 They're laughing at you<br />in there.
4312513 4314515 She doesn't care about you.
4316517 4317718 I do.
4320054 4322590 Do you know I moved<br />into your old apartment building
4322623 4325492 to make us a home<br />for when you get out?
4325526 4327662 -Did your lawyer tell you that?<br />-[picks up cigarettes]
4328428 4331032 -You did?<br />-[lighter clicks]
4331065 4332934 -I don't want to live there.<br />-[chuckles]
4337772 4338940 I'm pregnant.

4502870 4504271 [woman] I did, yes.
4507608 4508843 You believed he was dangerous.
4510945 4512847 [woman] Well,<br />he broke into my apartment.
4514715 4515950 You call the police?
4517351 4518519 No.
4520221 4523057 His mother told me, uh...
4523090 4525793 that he'd had problems<br />his whole life, but that he...
4525826 4527628 wouldn't hurt a fly.
4527661 4529296 -[dry chuckle]<br />-[scattered laughter]
4530264 4531665 And...
4532833 4537304 ...was the man who broke<br />into your apartment that night,
4537905 4543177 was he different in any way<br />from the Arthur Fleck you knew?
4544612 4546313 I didn't really know him.
4547148 4550818 I saw him in the lobby,<br />the elevator a few times.
4552286 4553988 Like I said,<br />I knew his mother a little bit.
4554021 4556257 She was really sweet<br />to my daughter.
4557691 4559060 [Dent] And Ms. Dumond,
4560394 4562730 why is it that you didn't want<br />to come here and testify today?
4563731 4567001 And why did you initially<br />ignore our subpoenas?
4567701 4570971 Well,<br />after Arthur did what he did,
4572306 4574308 the press wanted<br />to talk to me about it.
4575376 4577244 And then I was a character
4577278 4580247 in that awful TV movie<br />they made, and...
4581082 4582016 -[whispers] It was awful?<br />-Then all these people...
4582049 4583617 No.
4583651 4586120 ...supporters, I guess,<br />like the people outside,
4586153 4590257 started showing up<br />at my work and harassing me,
4590758 4592660 blaming me for what happened<br />to Arthur.
4594829 4597264 So I was afraid for my safety<br />and for my daughter's safety.
4597298 4598833 We moved out of the city.
4599266 4602803 Well, then why did you<br />finally decide to comply?
4602837 4604705 Because I should have<br />called the police that night.
4607174 4608909 Then maybe all those people<br />wouldn't have been...
4611078 4612947 Maybe they wouldn't be<br />dead now if I did.
4614849 4617218 Thank you. No more questions.
4618853 4620688 [judge]<br />Your witness, Ms. Stewart.
4623224 4624291 [Ms. Stewart] Ms. Dumond.
4626460 4628929 What happened<br />after you asked Arthur
4628963 4631232 to leave your apartment<br />that night?
4631265 4635236 He told me he was having<br />a bad day. And then he left.
4635269 4637905 So, he never hurt<br />or even threatened
4637938 4639340 you or your daughter?
4641108 4642243 [Sophie] No.
4643777 4646347 And did you watch him on TV<br />on <i>Murray Franklin</i><br />the following week?
4647014 4648282 [Sophie] I did.
4648849 4651218 [Ms. Stewart] And did that seem<br />like the same man
4651252 4653320 who was sitting<br />in your apartment that night?
4654021 4657858 Did he sound the same<br />or even look the same?
4658292 4661028 No, I mean, he was...<br />he was wearing clown make-up.
4661061 4662796 [laughter]
4662830 4665266 [Ms. Stewart]<br />And while Arthur's mother
4665299 4668469 was being so sweet<br />to your daughter,
4668502 4670704 what was she telling you<br />about her own son?
4674942 4676277 Um...
4678279 4680848 She told me that there was<br />something wrong with Arthur,
4680881 4683284 and that he lived<br />in a fantasy world
4683317 4686353 and that he had this laugh.
4686387 4688822 [Ms. Stewart] She told you<br />it was a "dumb laugh."
4688856 4691025 <i>That's what she called it.</i>
4691058 4693127 <i>"His dumb laugh."</i>
4693160 4694828 [Sophie] Yes.
4695763 4697097 [Ms. Stewart]<br />What else did she tell you?
4699099 4703337 That she made up a story,<br />when he was a kid.
4704305 4706508 So that he would feel<br />better about it.
4706541 4707975 So that he would stop crying,
4708008 4709944 so that he wouldn't<br />kill himself.
4710878 4712213 What was the story?
4713013 4715983 [Sophie] That he was put<br />on this earth to bring joy.
4717451 4719453 Something like that.<br />It's why she called him "Happy."
4720287 4721222 [Ms. Stewart] And?
4721255 4723991 [Sophie] And she...
4724024 4726060 couldn't believe that<br />he based his whole life
4726093 4728128 around this made-up story.
4728162 4731198 He was a street clown,<br />and he wanted to be a comedian.
4731232 4732967 [laughter]
4733000 4736136 [Ms. Stewart]<br />She made fun of him<br />for doing that?
4736170 4738072 [Sophie] She just thought<br />it was ridiculous
4738105 4739406 that he thought<br />he could make people laugh.
4739440 4741475 I mean, she said Arthur<br />wasn't funny at all.
4741509 4743877 -[laughter]<br />-[voices fading]
4743911 4745212 [Ms. Stewart] <i>Did she tell you</i><br /><i>that he had been</i>

5352653 5354387 are they in this courtroom<br />here today?
5354421 5355523 Yes.
5356090 5357925 Can you point him out<br />to all of us?
5358458 5362029 And... describe his clothing?
5363931 5366601 He's... He's sitting right there<br />at the table.

5406607 5407474 Yes.
5408009 5409409 Really?
5409977 5412980 [normal voice] Really?<br />Your last name is Puddles?
5413915 5415616 [scoffing chuckle]
5415650 5419452 [Southern accent]<br />Why, it sounds like a... a joke.
5420054 5420855 Well, it's not.
5422990 5425893 [normal voice]<br />You expect us to believe<br />that your last name is Puddles?
5425927 5427228 -Puddles?<br />-[laughter]
5427261 5430131 Mr. Fleck, where is this going?
5430164 5434101 As I said, I'm not gonna let you<br />turn my courtroom into a circus.
5434135 5435670 Okay.
5435703 5438873 But, um, with all due respect,<br />Your Honor,
5438906 5440942 don't you think<br />it's a little late for that?

5442877 5444779 [clears throat]
5445846 5448516 [Southern accent] Mr. Puddles...
5449250 5452553 earlier this afternoon<br />you testified
5452586 5455790 that you saw me stab<br />Mr. Kliman Manhoff
5455823 5459060 in the neck a couple of times.<br />Correct?
5459927 5460861 Kleinmanhoffer.
5461796 5463998 Yes, I saw you.
5464031 5465633 Mm.
5465666 5468936 And what else<br />did you see that day?
5470538 5473541 [voice shaking]<br />You stabbing him in the eye,
5473574 5476010 and bashing his head<br />into the wall,
5476043 5478746 many, many times.
5479213 5483718 Yes, but, uh, Randall<br />was a bit of a bully, wasn't he?
5484785 5486821 He didn't deserve to die.
5488889 5490825 -I don't know.<br />-[scattered chuckling]
5490858 5492226 Eh, never mind.
5492259 5495129 Gary, did you catch my act
5495162 5497598 on <i>The Murray Franklin Show</i><br />later that night?
5497965 5499266 No, I didn't.
5499300 5500167 No?
5501202 5505006 Might I remind you<br />that you are under oath?
5505039 5507041 I was locked up<br />at the police station.
5507074 5508743 In an interview room.
5509710 5511979 'Cause they thought<br />you might come and kill me.
5513314 5514749 I was the only witness.
5514782 5516650 They kept me in there all night.
5517885 5521055 Isn't that convenient,<br />Mr. Puddles?
5521088 5524025 That you didn't see the show,<br />you didn't see anything<br />I had to say,
5524058 5525593 [normal voice]<br />I can't believe it!
5525893 5526894 Mr. Fleck.
5527228 5528796 Okay. [clears throat]
5530664 5533267 [Southern accent]<br />Uh, when you were<br />in my mama's apartment,
5533300 5535269 God rest her soul,
5535302 5539740 when, as you say, you saw me<br />bash Mr. Klannonmen--
5539774 5544311 whatever's-- head into the wall,<br />"many, many times,"
5546047 5547748 did I seem crazy to you?
5549050 5552887 Did I seem<br />like a different person?
5552920 5559727 Or was I the same old Joker<br />that I always been?
5561195 5564665 Arthur, don't do this<br />to yourself, it isn't you.
5564999 5568636 [imitating accent] It isn't me?<br />So you don't think this is me?
5568669 5572239 Well, maybe... maybe...<br />you don't know who I really was.
5575109 5576744 I never saw that side of you.
5576777 5578345 [Southern accent]<br />Well, maybe you weren't looking.
5579146 5580915 Maybe no one was.
5580948 5584852 Because nobody knew I existed.
5584885 5587354 But look around,<br />look at all these people.
5587388 5591092 Everyone outside. These cameras.
5591125 5594161 Who do you think they see,<br />Mr. Puddles?
5595229 5597031 [sniffling] Joker.
5599834 5601869 Oh, sweet child,
5602937 5607875 what you have proven here today,<br />is that you are no different
5607908 5611011 than any of those people<br />that underestimated me.

5621355 5623390 <i>or you, or you,</i>

5636337 5637171 What?
5638105 5639673 Gary, I like you.
5640241 5642943 I told you I wouldn't hurt you,<br />and I didn't.
5642977 5644345 Not hurt me?
5644378 5646147 [crying softly]
5646180 5648149 I couldn't go back to work.
5649016 5653020 I still can't sleep,<br />and I'm scared all the time.
5654155 5656090 I never used to be scared.
5657158 5660895 I'm scared right now, here.<br />With you in front of me.
5663164 5666000 I couldn't do anything that day.
5666867 5669303 I felt so small.
5670404 5673674 [sniffles] I was reminded<br />how powerless I really am.
5675376 5678379 [Southern accent] Oh... you got<br />a flair for the dramatic.
