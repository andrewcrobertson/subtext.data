186150 187150 Who am I?
187509 189017 You sure you wanna know?
189529 192181 The story of my life is not<br />for the faint of heart.
192949 195422 If somebody said it was<br />a happy little tale...
195785 199984 if somebody told you I was just your<br />average guy, not a care in the world...
200415 201664 somebody lied.
203084 204281 But let me assure you,
204305 206671 this like any story worth telling...
206838 208214 is all about a girl.
209006 209911 That girl.
209935 211496 The girl next door.
211796 213437 Mary Jane Watson.
213761 216627 The woman I've loved since<br />before I even liked girls.
216931 219259 I'd like to tell you that's me next to her.
219851 221468 Aw, heck, I'd even take him.
223187 223925 Hey!
224069 225226 Stop the bus!
226774 227774 That's me.
228151 230027 Tell him to stop! Please!
230194 231194 Stop!
231510 233602 Hey! Stop the bus!
233781 234644 Stop the bus!
234668 237070 He's been chasing us<br />since Woodhaven Boulevard.
237285 238536 Catch a cab, Parker!
242999 244555 Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.
251215 252467 What a geek!
253176 254581 Don't even think about it.
254605 256652 You're so lame, Parker.
257555 259307 Would you date him?
277033 278631 Midtown High seniors.
279410 280690 No wandering.
281123 282583 Proceed direct. Knock it off.
283372 286419 Remember, it is a privilege to be here.
287251 290546 We're guests of Columbia<br />University's Science Department.
290571 292188 So behave accordingly.
293090 295511 Let's not have a repeat<br />of our trip to the planetarium.
296344 297970 Come on, people, stay together.
298137 300394 Proceed up the steps<br />and into the building.
302225 304504 Where were you?<br />Checking out the library.
305436 307373 Looking at the books.<br />Yeah, right.
310029 312109 Charles, can we drive<br />around the corner, please?
312276 313276 Why?
313778 315571 The entrance is right there.
315738 319450 Dad, these are public-school kids.<br />I'm not showing up in the Rolls.
319617 322199 What, you want me to trade in<br />my car for a Jetta...
322224 325264 because you flunked out of every<br />private school I sent you to?
325289 326319 It wasn't for me.
326445 327601 Of course it was.
328935 330770 Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
330795 332359 I'm not ashamed of who I am.
333506 334506 It's just...
334924 335951 Just what, Harry?
336634 337634 Forget it.
340911 341911 Pete!
342890 344559 Hi, Harry.<br />Hey, man. What's up?
344725 345725 Harry.
346269 347465 Won't you be needing this?
347918 348918 Thanks, Dad.
349565 351816 Peter, may I introduce<br />my father, Norman Osborn.
352167 353597 I've heard so much about you.
353710 355056 Great honor to meet you, sir.
355080 357170 Harry says you're a science whiz.
357321 357976 You know,
358000 360157 I'm something of a scientist myself.
360324 363494 I read all your research on nanotechnology.<br />Really brilliant.
363661 364774 And you understood it?
364798 366747 Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
366914 367914 Impressive.
368217 369959 Your parents must be very proud.
370133 371926 I live with my aunt and uncle.<br />They are.
372172 374758 Hey, you two! Let's move!
375089 376119 Nice to meet you.
376682 377830 Hope to see you again.<br />Yeah.
381095 382500 He doesn't seem so bad.
382681 384189 Not if you're a genius.
384640 386241 I think he wants to adopt you.
386892 388715 There are over 32,000,
388739 391436 known species of spiders in the world.
391814 393595 They're in the order Araneae,
393836 395585 divided into three suborders.
395783 396814 That's amazing!
397069 401157 This is the most advanced electron<br />microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.
401324 402381 It's unreal.
403534 404522 Arachnids,
404546 406006 from all three groups possess,
406031 409428 varying strengths which help<br />them in their constant search for food.
409915 410820 For example,
410844 412447 the Delena spider,
412613 414149 family Sparassidae...
414629 415867 has the ability,
416016 418089 to jump to catch its prey.
418966 420121 For the school paper?
425222 426586 Next we have,
426768 428129 the net web spider,
428550 430269 family Filistatidae...
430542 432182 genus Kukulcania.
432521 434928 It spins an intricate funnel shaped web
435442 437427 whose strands have a tensile strength,
437694 440475 proportionately equal to a type<br />of high tension wire
440500 442291 used in bridge building.
442823 444533 Leave him alone.<br />Or what?
444700 446976 Or his father will fire your father.
448079 449359 What's Daddy gonna do?
449383 450414 Sue me?
450581 452071 What is going on?
452784 454948 The next person who talks<br />will fail this course.
455261 456261 I kid you not.
456545 457916 This grass spider...<br />Let's go.
458018 460036 Hunts using a set of reflexes
460060 462853 with nerve conduction velocity so fast,
463094 466555 that some researchers believe<br />that it almost borders on precognition.
466763 468765 An early awareness of danger.<br />Those guys are jerks.
469099 470892 A spider-sense.
471518 472981 Hey, look at that spider.
473251 476989 Some spiders change colors<br />to blend into their environment.
478025 479519 It's a defense mechanism.
480110 481110 Peter,
481379 483404 what makes you think<br />I would want to know that?
483572 484457 Who wouldn't?
484534 486980 Over five painstaking years,
487004 489158 Columbia's genetic research facility...
489183 490400 You gonna talk to her now?
490424 493504 No. Come on. You talk to her.
493586 495504 Armed with these DNA blueprints...
495626 498478 we have now begun what<br />was once thought impossible.
498506 499617 Disgusting.
500100 501990 Yeah, hateful little things.
502382 503758 I love them!
504301 505319 Yeah, me too.
506929 507929 You know,
508271 510232 spiders can change their color...
510607 512756 to blend into their environment.
513302 514302 Really?
514978 517260 Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
518700 519449 Cool.<br />Yeah.
519474 522520 Transfer RNA to encode<br />an entirely new genome
522861 525988 combining the genetic information<br />rom all three spiders
526156 526811 into these,
526835 530327 15 genetically designed super-spiders.
530720 531829 There's 14.
532955 533955 I beg your pardon?
534498 535498 One's missing.
535979 536979 Yeah.
539962 542588 I guess the researchers<br />are working on that one.
543183 546518 Do you know that this is<br />the largest electron microscope
546543 547927 on the Eastern Seaboard?
548011 551315 You were talking throughout<br />that woman's entire presentation.
552224 553975 Let's go talk about how we listen.
558063 558760 Now,
558969 561641 I don't know what it's like<br />at those fancy private schools...
562359 564359 but at Midtown High...<br />112.5.
570594 571594 Hey.
572874 574067 Could I take your picture?
574091 575820 I need one with a student in it.
576537 577821 Sure, yeah.
577845 578988 Great.<br />Where do you want me?
579606 580606 Over here?
580794 582128 Yeah. Yeah that's great.
582546 583817 Don't make me look ugly.
584776 586105 That's impossible.
593963 594963 Perfect.
602691 604087 Is that good?<br />Great.
609781 610781 That's great.
616747 618234 MJ, let's go!
620292 621292 Wait.
621445 622445 Thanks!
636350 637350 Parker,
637968 638968 let's do it.
655827 657525 We solved the horizon glide,
657681 659288 and the multi-G balance issues.
659456 661572 I've already seen the glider.
662417 664314 That's not what I'm here for.
664669 666590 General Slocum,<br />good to see you again.
668173 670341 Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.
670490 671289 Norman.
671383 672394 Mr. Osborn.
672594 676138 Always a pleasure to have our board<br />of directors pay us a little visit.
676348 679767 I want to see the progress report<br />on human performance enhancers.
679935 682692 We tried vapor inhalation<br />with rogue subjects,
682783 684438 they showed an 800% increase in strength!
684488 686364 800%? That's excellent.<br />Any side effects?
686650 687770 In one trial, yes.
687795 688723 It was an aberration.
688747 690591 All the tests since<br />then have been successful.
690737 692936 And in the trial that went wrong,<br />what happened?
692960 694287 What were the side effects?
694587 695587 Violence,
695779 696810 aggression...
697661 698810 and insanity.
699079 700193 And what do you recommend?
700217 701724 That was only one test.
702082 703821 With the exception of Dr. Stromm,
703845 706014 our entire staff certifies the product
706086 707533 ready for human testing.
707806 708991 Dr. Stromm?
710340 712613 We need to take the whole line<br />back to formula.
715262 716459 Back to formula?
716483 717504 Dr. Osborn.
718849 720229 I'm gonna be frank with you.
720934 722966 I never supported your program.
723284 725440 We have my predecessor<br />to thank for that.
725939 726511 Norman,
726535 728834 the general gave<br />the go-ahead to Quest Aerospace
728859 731377 to build a prototype<br />of their exoskeleton design.
732112 733393 They test in two weeks.
733417 736771 And if your so-called performance<br />enhancers have not had a...
736795 739721 successful human trial by that date,
740537 741859 I'm gonna pull your funding.
742328 743750 I'm going to give it to them.
746506 748023 Gentlemen. Ladies.
753467 755540 And the Lord said, Let there be light.
755564 756708 And voil√†!
757271 758342 There is light.
759139 761302 Forty soft, glowing watts of it.
761391 763798 Good boy. God will be thrilled.
764001 765425 Just don't fall on your ass.
766563 768597 I'm already on my ass, May.
769207 772098 When the plant's senior electrician<br />is laid off after...
772358 775226 after 35 years,<br />what else would you call it?
775250 776832 I am on my ass.
776857 778482 Hand me that dish. The green one.
779169 782138 The corporation is<br />downsizing the people and...
782537 783911 upsizing their profits.
784664 786982 Ben, you'll get<br />another job somewhere.
788712 789712 Well...
789966 791589 let's look in the paper and see.
792631 794832 There are the want ads.<br />What do we got here?
795490 796645 Computer...
797427 798985 Computer salesman,
799009 801338 computer engineer, computer analyst.
801363 804454 My Lord, even the computers<br />need analysts these days.
805393 806924 May, I'm 68 years old.
806948 810689 I'm too old for computers and<br />besides, I have a family to provide for.
810899 812095 I love you.
812328 813776 And Peter loves you.
814027 817279 You're the most responsible man<br />I've ever known.
817531 819187 We've been down-and-out before.
819211 821047 But somehow, we survived.
821399 822399 Yeah.
823078 824108 Hi, sweetie.
824132 825132 You're just...
825555 827373 Just in time for dinner.
827582 828279 Hey.
828303 830125 How you doing, buddy?<br />How was the field trip?
830293 832285 I don't feel well.<br />I'm gonna go to sleep.
833116 834167 You won't have a bite?
834192 835730 No thanks. Had a bite.
836114 838341 Did, did you get some pictures, Peter?
839383 841364 I gotta crash. Everything's fine.
843473 844535 What's that all about?
866329 868539 In this recombination lab,
868707 873335 we use synthesized transfer RNA<br />to encode an entirely new genome
873545 876732 combining the genetic<br />information from all three spiders
876798 881107 into these 15 genetically<br />designed super-spiders.
896067 897265 Dr. Osborn, please.
897629 899785 The performance enhancers aren't ready.
900196 902453 The data just doesn't justify this test.
903700 905439 Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
905852 907203 We can't do this.
907537 909255 Don't be a coward.
910206 912791 Risks are part of laboratory science.
913001 914107 Let me reschedule,
914431 916712 with a proper medical staff<br />and a volunteer.
916805 919078 I mean if you just give me two weeks.<br />Two weeks?
919571 920525 In two weeks,
920550 923785 we'll have lost the contract<br />to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.
924094 925001 Sometimes,
925025 926746 you gotta do things yourself.
927140 929005 Get me the Promachloraperazine.
929305 930084 For what?
930109 933077 It begins catalyzation, when<br />the vapor hits the bloodstream.
936650 938406 40,000 years of evolution
938431 941859 and we've barely even tapped<br />the vastness of human potential.
956499 957617 That's cold.
1016146 1017146 Norman?
1021651 1022651 Norman!
1024018 1025018 Norman!
1033530 1034530 My God.
1036499 1037499 Oh my God!
1038100 1039100 Norman?
1040295 1042045 My God, Norman!
1044531 1045531 Norman!
1058813 1060272 Back to formula?
1094948 1095948 Weird.
1107487 1108862 Peter?<br />Yeah?
1109072 1110330 Are you alright?
1112742 1113742 I'm fine.
1114911 1116787 Any better this morning?<br />Any change?
1116955 1117955 Change?
1119332 1120332 Yep.
1120696 1121392 Big change.
1121417 1122656 Well, hurry up.
1122843 1124075 You're gonna be late.
1124216 1125216 Right.
1143815 1144815 Ok.
1149237 1150601 Goodness me!
1150625 1151625 Jeez.
1152273 1153843 I thought you were sick.
1154242 1155576 I got better.<br />You see?
1155601 1156565 Bye, guys.
1156589 1158793 You haven't eaten anything.<br />Have you got your lunch money?
1158817 1159524 Yeah, I got it.
1159549 1162655 Hey, Michelangelo, don't forget, we're<br />painting the kitchen right after school.
1162679 1164323 You got it?<br />Sure thing, Uncle Ben.
1164784 1165784 Don't start without me.
1165809 1167174 And don't start up with me.
1169507 1170507 Teenagers.
1170737 1172744 Raging hormones.<br />They never change.
1174565 1175945 Mary jane talk to me!
1175970 1177526 You're trash!<br />You're always gonna be trash!
1177550 1178463 Just like her!
1178488 1180370 I have to go to school.<br />Who's stopping you?
1199287 1200287 Hi, MJ.
1201831 1202831 Hey, MJ.
1203583 1205573 I don't know if you realize this,<br />but we've...
1206505 1209378 we've been neighbors since I was 6,<br />and I was wondering if maybe...
1210208 1211816 we could get together sometime?<br />Hey M.J?
1211841 1213036 I got the car. Hop in.
1213061 1214301 Maybe do something fun?<br />Hi guys!
1214755 1216301 Or I don't know.<br />Come on.
1216326 1219077 I thought it'd be time<br />to get to know each other.
1220475 1221475 Or not.
1227190 1229119 Sorry Parker, the bus is full!<br />Hey!
1230104 1231104 Hey!
1231277 1233252 Stop the bus!<br />Catch a cab!
1234279 1235341 Tell him to stop.
1236699 1238131 Check him out!<br />Dork!
1261182 1262182 Dad!
1262892 1263339 Dad!
1263464 1264464 Are you alright?
1265603 1266603 Harry.
1270233 1271754 What are you doing on the floor?
1272293 1273332 I don't know.
1274570 1275887 Have you been there all night?
1278908 1280158 Last night I was...
1282495 1283495 What?
1284998 1286865 I don't remember.<br />Mr. Osborn?
1286916 1288990 Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.
1289460 1290741 Sorry, my father's not feeling well.
1290765 1291992 Mr. Osborn...
1292419 1293654 Dr. Stromm is dead.
1293897 1294897 What?
1294986 1296872 They found his body<br />this morning in the lab.
1297530 1298727 He's been murdered, sir.
1298865 1300042 What are you talking about?
1300264 1301889 And the flight suit and the glider...
1302390 1303170 What about it?
1303194 1304474 It's been stolen, sir.
1330418 1331645 Great reflexes!
1333046 1333701 Thanks.
1333725 1334871 No problem.
1336299 1337299 Hey you...
1337377 1338289 have blue eyes.
1338313 1340218 I... I didn't notice without your glasses.
1340970 1342400 You just get contacts?
1349395 1350395 Well,
1350477 1351477 see you.
1393356 1394428 What happened?
1395035 1396121 He's freaking weird.
1397318 1398693 Did you see that?
1400279 1401279 Parker?
1433855 1435895 It's a fight!<br />Think you're pretty funny, don't you freak?
1435919 1437513 Flash, it was just an accident.
1437537 1439502 My fist breaking your<br />teeth, that's the accident.
1439527 1440933 Come on Flash, stop.
1440957 1442237 I don't wanna fight you, Flash.
1442262 1443685 I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.
1443951 1444964 Kick his ass.
1465094 1466136 Help him, Harry.
1471100 1472291 How'd he do that?
1473603 1474603 Which one?
1475104 1476104 He's all yours, man.
1491996 1493359 Flash, get up!
1495333 1497383 Jesus Parker, you are a freak.
1499045 1501107 Peter, that was amazing.
1502798 1504329 I'm out of here. Come on.
1507837 1508837 Peter.
1609809 1610809 Go, web!
1612616 1613616 Fly.
1615828 1617184 Up, up and away, web.
1619516 1620516 Shazam!
1621339 1621989 Go!
1622165 1622673 Go!
1622918 1623946 Go, web, go!
1657870 1658932 Tallyho.
1703541 1705961 Is she back with the beer yet?<br />What?
1706335 1707585 Come here, bring me some beer!
1707795 1709117 Get up off your ass!
1709141 1710338 I paid for beer...
1710363 1711863 Stop yelling!<br />Stop it!
1712033 1713413 You're as stupid as your mother.
1713437 1714437 Get away from me!
1714677 1716261 You are drunk, do you know that?
1716429 1718139 Where's she going?<br />Where you going?
1718164 1719164 Where you going?
1719280 1720504 Stop, look!
1720528 1721838 These dishes are not done.
1721862 1723393 Somebody's gotta do the dishes!
1723602 1725342 Why don't you do them?
1725366 1727750 Get in here little girl<br />and you do the dishes, now!
1727805 1730992 You do them. They're yours, anyway.<br />I'm going out!
1731444 1732641 Were you listening to that?
1732665 1733665 No.
1734280 1736019 Well I heard, but I was just...
1736175 1737664 taking out the trash.
1737700 1739178 I guess you can always hear us.
1739681 1740299 Well,
1740682 1742108 everybody shouts.
1743285 1744535 Your aunt and uncle don't.
1745207 1747590 They can scream<br />pretty good sometimes.
1749712 1750356 Listen,
1750725 1752160 MJ, about today
1753014 1754150 at school with Flash...
1754175 1755615 You really freaked us out.
1756010 1757010 I'm sorry.
1757178 1758178 Is he ok?
1758554 1761133 He's just happy you didn't give him<br />a black eye for graduation.
1765603 1767329 So where are you going<br />after you graduate?
1770930 1771930 I...
1773569 1775336 I wanna move into the city.
1776780 1778061 And hopefully...
1778523 1779730 get a job as a...
1780366 1781366 photographer.
1781814 1783374 Work my way through college.
1785581 1786581 What about you?
1787082 1788465 Headed for the city too.
1789793 1791637 Can't wait to get out of here.
1793214 1794214 I wanna...
1795966 1796966 What?
1800304 1801304 No, come on.
1801954 1802954 Try me.
1803474 1804474 I wanna...
1806101 1807101 Act...
1808604 1809604 on stage.
1810606 1811606 Really?
1812816 1814184 That's perfect.
1815277 1817886 You were awesome<br />in all the school plays.
1818155 1818852 Really?
1818876 1819876 Yeah.
1820658 1823660 I cried like a baby<br />when you played Cinderella.
1824111 1825690 Peter, that was first grade.
1826713 1827713 Well...
1828764 1829807 even so.
1831377 1832580 Sometimes...
1834129 1835166 you know people.
1836966 1837996 You can just...
1838441 1839597 see what's coming.
1843639 1845292 What do you see coming for you?
1848798 1849885 I don't know.
1852982 1854012 Whatever it is,
1854887 1856768 it's something I never felt before.
1861169 1862169 And...
1862591 1863700 what for me?
1864123 1865123 For you?
1866993 1868568 You're gonna light up Broadway.
1871333 1872333 You know,
1876953 1878631 you're taller than you look.
1879842 1880842 I hunch.
1883637 1884637 Don't.
1888684 1889684 Hey, MJ!
1889894 1892246 Come take a ride<br />in my new birthday present.
1893314 1894314 Come on!
1895357 1896363 I gotta go.
1897599 1898599 Bye.
1899695 1902363 My God, it's gorgeous!<br />Yeah, right?
1902531 1904138 Look at it!<br />Hop in.
1904700 1906671 Oh my God! What a cool car!
1907202 1908202 Pretty tight?
1909204 1911027 Wait untill you hear the sound system.
1911051 1913100 Hey, don't scratch the leather.
1915044 1916044 Cool car.
2006699 2007699 Peter?
2009263 2011490 What's... What's going on in there?
2011515 2012545 I'm exercising.
2012569 2013855 I'm not dressed, Aunt May.
2014207 2014923 Well,
2015206 2017277 you're acting so strangely, Peter.
2018272 2019706 Ok. Thanks.
2051180 2052252 Something's bothering him.
2052502 2054515 Maybe he's too embarrassed<br />to tell me what it is.
2054683 2055803 Maybe I'm too embarrassed...
2056274 2057470 to ask him.
2058145 2059720 I just don't know anymore.
2060606 2063017 I'm going to the downtown library.<br />I'll see you later.
2063042 2063888 Yeah, wait Pete.
2063912 2065557 I'll drive you there, buddy.
2065581 2066602 No, I'll take the train.
2066627 2068059 No, no, no. I need the exercise.<br />Go on.
2068083 2069346 Go, go, go, go.
2080983 2082574 Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.<br />No, wait a minute.
2082598 2084443 Peter we need... we need to talk.
2084838 2086036 We can talk later.
2086405 2087663 Well, we can talk now.
2088608 2089631 If you let me.
2090093 2092303 What do we have to talk about?<br />Why now?
2092471 2094489 Because we haven't talked<br />at all for so long
2094514 2096739 your Aunt May and I don't<br />even know who you are anymore.
2096778 2098396 You shirk your chores.
2098771 2101842 You have all those weird experiments<br />in your room.
2102412 2105693 You start fights at school, you know.<br />I didn't start that fight, I told you that.
2106040 2107515 Well, you sure as hell finished it.
2107857 2109621 What was I supposed to do, run away?<br />No.
2109646 2111552 No, you're not supposed<br />to run away, but...
2112574 2113438 Pete, look.
2113462 2114355 You're changing.
2114379 2117161 I know, I went through exactly<br />the same thing at your age.
2117329 2118708 No. Not exactly.
2119187 2120187 Peter...
2120707 2123200 these are the years<br />when a man changes
2123428 2126576 into the man he's gonna<br />become the rest of his life.
2127927 2130220 Just be careful who you change into.
2132386 2134333 This guy, Flash Thompson.
2134651 2136889 He probably deserved what happened.
2137432 2139565 But just because you can beat him up,
2140602 2142047 doesn't give you the right to.
2143430 2144430 Remember,
2144734 2145970 with great power,
2146266 2148422 comes great responsibility.
2149361 2152268 Are you afraid that I'm gonna<br />turn into some kind of criminal?
2152743 2154275 Quit worrying about me, ok?
2154300 2155480 Something's different.
2155504 2156648 I'll figure it out.
2156672 2158226 Stop lecturing me, please.
2158250 2160527 I don't mean to lecture,<br />I don't mean to preach.
2161063 2162599 And I know I'm not your father...
2162624 2164281 Then stop pretending to be!
2169548 2170548 Right.
2173760 2175171 I'll pick you up here at 10.
2207085 2214163 Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
2217106 2218877 One, two, three.
2219167 2220785 That's it!<br />Who's the man?
2220981 2225270 Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
2225687 2227897 Ladies and gentlemen...
2228065 2232610 Give it up for Bone Saw McGraw!
2235697 2238566 For $3000,
2239534 2242652 is there no one here<br />man enough to stay in the ring
2242677 2247730 for three minutes<br />with this titan of testosterone?
2250793 2251957 Who?
2253089 2254316 I know who.
2255050 2259845 The Flying Dutchman!
2260313 2261313 Next.
2262474 2264849 There's no featherweight<br />division here, small fry.
2265197 2265849 . Next.
2265936 2267169 No, no. Sign me up.
2268188 2269188 Ok.
2269763 2271792 You understand<br />the NYWL is not responsible
2271817 2273283 for any injury you may and
2273307 2275903 probably will sustain while<br />participating in said event?
2276071 2278352 And you are indeed participating<br />under your own free will?
2278490 2279490 Yes.
2279741 2280939 Down the hall to the ramp.
2280963 2282190 May God be with you.
2282780 2283780 Next.
2286123 2288091 Told you! Told you!
2288583 2290692 Winner!
2290717 2292052 Next victim!
2293672 2296137 Are you ready for more?
2297676 2301262 Bone Saw is ready!
2303682 2308082 Will the next victim please<br />enter the arena at this time?
2308562 2311761 If he can withstand just three minutes<br />in the cage
2311785 2316391 with Bone Saw McGraw,<br />the sum of $3000
2316415 2317903 will be paid to...
2318780 2319780 What's your name, kid?
2320126 2321368 The Human Spider.
2322367 2324744 The Human Spider, that's it?<br />That's the best you got?
2324911 2325525 Yeah.
2325549 2326801 That sucks.
2327205 2331709 The sum of $3000 will be paid to...
2331877 2333074 the terrifying,
2333098 2335129 the deadly,
2335380 2338847 the amazing Spider-Man!
2340969 2343596 My name's The Human Spider.<br />I don't care, get out there.
2343621 2346336 No, he got my name wrong.<br />Get out there, you moron.
2348979 2352200 Bone Saw will eat you up<br />and spit you out, little man.
2352225 2354106 I hope you brought<br />your mommy with you.
2354131 2357269 We'll break you!<br />You'll need someone to cry to.
2359112 2363638 I'm gonna rip all eight of your<br />feeble legs off one by one!
2364743 2366786 Oh my God!
2366995 2368034 My legs!
2368789 2371023 God. I can't feel my legs.
2371492 2379492 Kill! Kill! Kill!
2383512 2384720 Cage!
2394064 2395523 Hello? Guys?
2396566 2401529 Will the guards please lock<br />the cage doors at this time?
2402239 2403239 Hey, listen.
2403520 2406293 This is some kind of mistake.<br />I didn't sign up for a cage match!
2406702 2407398 Hey!
2407670 2409150 Unlock the thing!
2409377 2410444 Take the chain off!
2410483 2411991 Hey, freak show!
2412415 2414295 You're going, nowhere.
2415210 2417132 I got you for three minutes.
2417691 2419984 Three minutes of playtime.
2426680 2429798 What are you doing up there?<br />Staying away from you.
2430350 2431589 That's a cute outfit.
2431613 2432935 Did your husband give it to you?
2440068 2441127 Finish him off!
2448785 2449879 Smash him!
2457502 2459105 Hit him!<br />Harder!
2461256 2463128 Kick his spider ass!
2465594 2466760 Hit him!
2480192 2481984 One, two, three!
2482194 2483266 That's it! That's it!
2484287 2485239 Winner!
2485264 2487687 Ladies and gentlemen, give it up<br />for the new champion,
2487765 2490405 Spider-Man!
2491119 2495811 Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!
2496146 2498704 Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!
2507636 2508779 Now get out of here.
2510931 2512128 A hundred bucks?
2512152 2513766 The ad said 3000.
2513975 2515731 Well, check it again, webhead.
2516519 2517925 It said three grand,
2518183 2520276 for three minutes.<br />And you pinned him in two.
2520607 2523581 For that, I give you 100<br />and you're lucky to get that.
2524152 2525527 I need that money.
2525987 2528278 I missed the part<br />where that's my problem.
2537165 2538738 Hey, what the hell?
2538887 2540254 Put the money in the bag.
2542219 2543219 Hurry up!
2550011 2552262 Hey! He stole the gate!
2552451 2553754 Stop that guy!
2554734 2556867 Stop him! He's got my money!
2557269 2558269 Thanks.
2559688 2561969 What the hell's the matter with you?<br />You let him go!
2562357 2564566 Cut him off in the lobby<br />and call the cops!
2564734 2566599 You could've taken that guy apart.
2566623 2568779 Now he's gonna get away<br />with my money.
2568947 2570958 I missed the part<br />where that's my problem.
2590719 2592359 Sir, you gotta get back.<br />Get back.
2592425 2594206 I can't see anything.<br />What happened?
2594889 2596047 Old dude, man.
2596474 2598099 Come on folks. Keep moving, please.
2598419 2599981 Please, keep moving. Let's go!
2600812 2603226 What happened?<br />Someone got hurt.
2606026 2606764 Excuse me.
2606788 2608599 Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
2608623 2609623 Stay back.
2609738 2611572 Hey, stay back! Stay back!<br />That's my uncle!
2613742 2614689 What happened?
2614713 2616187 Carjacker. He's been shot.
2616314 2618514 But we just called the paramedics.<br />They're on their way.
2620248 2621248 Uncle Ben?
2622542 2623542 Uncle Ben.
2627797 2628797 Uncle Ben?
2632761 2633761 Peter.
2635138 2636364 I'm here, Uncle Ben.
2642562 2643562 Peter.
2665752 2667158 They got the shooter.
2667182 2668924 He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.
2669005 2670703 We got three cars in pursuit.
2670953 2673351 Alright. Folks come on.<br />Come up. Move back.
2830833 2832834 Get a unit to the rear!
2835797 2837339 I got the back!
2850270 2851410 Who's there?
2877880 2878786 Don't hurt me.
2878810 2879995 Just give me a chance.
2880019 2881200 Just give me a chance!
2881269 2882373 What about my uncle?
2882397 2883874 Did you give him a chance?
2884301 2885301 Did you?
2885760 2886760 Answer me!
2890685 2892401 Stop that guy!
2897358 2898358 Thanks.
2909120 2910120 See you.
2931893 2932715 Freeze!
2932739 2934963 We've got the place<br />completely surrounded.
2977855 2979214 No. My God.
2982402 2984136 No.<br />My God. No!
2994455 2995527 Good evening General.
2996097 2997097 Good to see you.
2998209 3001086 Our exoskeleton's got<br />real firepower, General Slocum.
3001254 3005293 Well, if it does what you say it can,<br />I'll sign that contract tomorrow.
3007885 3010978 He's clear, let's go!<br />I assume you're confident about this test?
3011003 3011794 Absolutely.
3011818 3013470 Captain Curtis is our top pilot.
3014142 3016665 Now, what about<br />your commitment to OSCORP?
3017061 3020852 Nothing would please me more than<br />to put Norman Osborn out of business.
3023317 3024515 Preflight complete.
3025125 3026125 Mark.
3030491 3033233 We are picking up an<br />unidentified object, closing fast.
3033286 3034369 What the hell is that?
3034537 3035537 Can you see anything?
3036497 3037497 Oh my God!
3048134 3048956 Say chess.
3048980 3050277 Chess!
3051512 3052512 Peter!
3053598 3054378 Darling.
3054402 3057517 I'm so proud of you.<br />You looked so handsome up there.
3057685 3058340 Pete?
3058364 3061772 Good news. My father got the place<br />in New York, so we're all set this fall.
3061939 3063523 That's great.<br />You made it.
3066110 3068382 It's not the first time<br />I've been proven wrong.
3071032 3072741 Congratulations.<br />Thanks, Dad.
3073701 3075357 Peter, the science award.
3075561 3076596 That's terrific.
3076621 3077621 Yeah.
3080875 3083293 I know this has been<br />a difficult time for you
3084420 3086668 but I want you to try to enjoy this day.
3087882 3088996 Commencement.
3089592 3090956 The end of one thing.
3091739 3093121 The start of something new.
3095556 3096962 I don't want to be with you anymore.
3096986 3098720 Here's your ring.
3100102 3101477 You know what? Whatever.
3102522 3103522 Your loss.
3104690 3106096 You're like a brother to Harry.
3106484 3107727 That makes you family.
3108480 3110350 And if you ever need anything just...
3110530 3111530 give me a call.
3124790 3125790 Can I...
3126128 3127422 Can I fix you something?
3128548 3129548 No, thanks.
3174802 3176335 I missed him a lot today.
3179520 3180520 I know.
3182852 3183961 I miss him too.
3186439 3188148 But he was there.
3191944 3194393 I can't help thinking about...
3195551 3197293 the last thing I said to him.
3197372 3199481 He tried to tell me something<br />important,
3199988 3201777 and I threw it in his face.
3204123 3205511 You loved him
3207877 3209341 and he loved you.
3211005 3213599 He never doubted<br />the man you'd grow into.
3214842 3217115 How you were meant for great things.
3218846 3220348 You won't disappoint him.
3254715 3255913 With great power...
3256574 3258550 comes great responsibility.
3259053 3260250 Remember that, Pete.
3260696 3261847 Remember that.
3272274 3273307 Hurry up!
3285913 3286994 This is not a man.
3287019 3289619 My brother saw him building a<br />nest in the Lincoln Center Fountain.
3289834 3291114 I think he's human,
3291138 3293115 I think he's a man.<br />Could be a woman.
3297038 3297871 Bobby.
3297895 3299247 Get a load of this!
3303143 3305019 He throws up his hands,<br />ropes come out,
3305266 3307366 and he climbs up<br />the ropes like a spider web.
3307601 3309508 I see the web and it's his signature,
3309532 3311872 and I know Spider-Man was here.
3311897 3313345 The guy protects us, you know?
3313369 3314524 He protects the people.
3314692 3317444 Some kind of freakyloo or something.<br />Wackadoo.
3317611 3319612 He stinks and I don't like him.
3320364 3321434 Don't move, lady!
3330041 3331154 Guy with eight hands.
3331683 3332792 Sounds hot.
3332861 3334987 He has those tights<br />and that tight little...
3351062 3352634 Who is Spider-Man?
3352658 3354356 He's a criminal, that's who he is!
3354982 3355846 A vigilante.
3355870 3357014 A public menace.
3357038 3358772 What's he doing on my front page?
3358952 3361248 Mr. Jameson, your wife's on line one.<br />She needs to know if you...
3361272 3362716 Mr. Jameson, there's a page six problem.
3362740 3364389 We have a page one problem. Shut up.
3364520 3366062 Well?<br />He's news.
3366577 3369139 They're really important clients.<br />They can't wait. They're about to.
3369163 3371570 He pulled six people off that subway car.
3371594 3373249 Sure, from a wreck he probably caused.
3373417 3375228 Something goes wrong<br />and this creepy crawler is there.
3375252 3377587 Look at that. He's fleeing the scene!<br />What's that tell ya?
3377755 3380507 He's not fleeing, he's probably<br />going to save somebody else.
3380535 3381817 He's a hero!
3381842 3383002 Then why does he wear a mask?
3383776 3384786 What's he got to hide?
3384845 3387807 She just needs to know if you want the<br />chintz or the chenille in the dining room.
3387831 3388879 Whichever one's cheaper.
3388903 3390534 Mr. Jameson, it's like this.
3390684 3392151 We double-booked page six.
3392186 3394522 See, so both Macy's and Conway's<br />both have three quarters...
3394546 3396511 We sold out four printings.
3397382 3398125 Sold out?
3398150 3399400 Every copy.
3399914 3402487 Tomorrow morning, Spider-Man,<br />page one with a decent picture this time.
3402511 3404254 Move Conway to page 7.<br />There's a problem with page 7...
3404278 3406843 And make it page eight, get him<br />10 percent off. Make it five percent.
3406867 3408284 That can't be done.<br />Get outta here!
3408744 3410796 The problem is,<br />we don't have a decent picture.
3410821 3413675 Eddie's been on it for weeks,<br />we can barely get a glimpse of him.
3414058 3415237 What is he, shy?
3416043 3419923 If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a<br />thong, we can surely get a picture with this weirdo.
3420104 3421286 Put an ad on the front page.
3421388 3423135 Cash money for a picture of Spider-Man.
3423801 3425082 He doesn't wanna be famous?
3425635 3427262 I'll make him infamous!
3438482 3439482 Hey!
3439733 3440733 Buzz off.
3441861 3443391 MJ, it's me, Peter.
3443415 3444415 Hi!
3444463 3445463 Hey.
3446532 3447700 What are you doing around here?
3447724 3450188 I'm begging for a job.<br />How about you?
3451912 3453360 I'm headed to an audition.
3453384 3454384 An audition?
3454719 3455820 So you're acting now?
3455939 3456939 Yeah.
3457203 3458323 I work steady.
3458797 3460920 In fact, I just got off a job.
3461182 3462349 That's great, MJ!
3462840 3463870 You're doing it!
3464058 3465737 You're living your dream!<br />Hey, glamour girl!
3465761 3467844 Yeah.<br />Your drawer was short $6!
3468012 3469167 Next time that happens,
3469191 3470638 I'mma take it out of your check.
3471724 3473213 Excuse me, Miss Watson?
3473464 3474631 I'm talking to you!
3474655 3475655 Hey!
3475728 3477948 Yes, Enrique! Ok? I get you.
3477973 3479636 Well, it better not happen<br />no more, you hear me?
3479660 3481268 Don't roll your eyes at me.
3489283 3490292 Some dream?
3491869 3493744 It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
3494663 3495735 Don't tell Harry.
3495837 3496947 Don't tell Harry?
3497875 3499406 Aren't you guys living together?
3499751 3501299 We're going out. Didn't he tell you?
3502880 3503924 Yeah. Right.
3504715 3507800 I think he'd hate the idea<br />of my waiting tables.
3507968 3509583 He'd think it was low or something.
3509885 3510917 It's not low.
3511267 3512388 You have a job.
3512723 3513894 You know Harry...
3514777 3517060 doesn't live on a little place<br />I like to call Earth.
3518562 3520402 No, I guess not.
3525486 3526674 Thanks, Pete.
3528489 3529892 We should catch up sometime.
3534518 3536127 Let's get some lunch some evening.
3538415 3539571 Well I...
3539758 3542805 I'll come by and have some of your<br />Moondance coffee some day.
3543128 3544409 And I won't tell Harry.
3544433 3545838 No, don't tell Harry.
3546014 3547014 I won't!
3549426 3550799 I won't tell Harry.
3562481 3564293 Timing's perfect. Hey.
3565150 3566431 Five new contracts.
3566455 3567551 It'll be great.
3570799 3573306 Storming Norman's<br />making his weekly inspection.
3574201 3575962 Spent half of it on the phone.
3576974 3579361 Look, man, I'm glad you're here.<br />I need your help.
3579385 3580769 I'm really lost here.
3582583 3583605 Are you alright?
3585269 3586451 You look like you just got,
3586475 3588316 second place in the science fair.
3588488 3589597 No I...
3591074 3593845 I was late for work<br />and Dr. Connors fired me.
3593942 3595003 You were late again?
3596223 3597223 I don't get it.
3597956 3599356 Wait, where do you go all the time?
3600352 3601352 Around.
3601887 3602887 Peter Parker.
3603814 3605553 Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
3605789 3606528 Who's that?
3606553 3608651 This mystery girl Harry's been dating.<br />Dad.
3609945 3611612 When do I get to meet her?<br />Dad.
3611959 3613911 Well sorry, Harry hasn't mentioned her.
3617953 3619859 Hey Pete, you're probably looking for a...
3620068 3621257 a job now, right?
3621415 3622985 Dad, maybe you can help him out.
3624418 3627575 No I... I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.<br />It's no problem.
3627700 3628856 I'll make a few calls.
3628881 3630412 No, I couldn't accept it, sir.
3630436 3633176 I like to earn what I get.<br />I can find my own work.
3633385 3634385 I respect that.
3635865 3637807 You want to make<br />it on your own steam.
3638557 3639627 That's great.
3640768 3642557 What other skills do you have, Parker?
3643312 3645685 I was thinking of something in photography.
3648400 3649400 Hello.
3651570 3652570 Let's go!
3652739 3653739 Move it!
3655032 3656070 Watch the street!
3672132 3673132 Cheese!
3682434 3683435 They're crap.
3683936 3684936 Crap.
3684974 3686607 Crap. Megacrap.
3687106 3688636 I'll give you $200 for all of them.
3688845 3690301 That seems a little low.
3690484 3691731 Take them somewhere else, then.
3692403 3695203 Sir, your wife says the tile you<br />ordered for the foyer is out of stock.
3695473 3696913 Tell her we'll just put a rug there.
3697116 3697937 Sit down.
3697961 3698961 Give me that.
3700661 3701733 Give you 300.
3701757 3703204 That's the standard freelance fee.
3703372 3705320 Tear up page one.<br />Run that photo instead.
3705344 3706104 Headline?
3706142 3708031 Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?
3708055 3709436 Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos.
3709461 3710283 Menace?
3710307 3712648 He was protecting that armoured...<br />Tell you what, Atticus.
3712673 3714287 You take the pictures,<br />I'll make up the headlines. Ok?
3714311 3715485 Alright? That ok with you?
3715629 3717040 Yes, sir.<br />Goody.
3718011 3719292 Give this to the girl up front.
3719316 3720675 She'll see you get paid.
3721710 3722837 I'd like a job, sir.
3722861 3724589 No jobs. Freelance.
3724805 3726534 Best thing in the world for a kid your age.
3726812 3729515 You bring me some more shots<br />of that newspaper-selling clown,
3729540 3730980 maybe I'll take them off your hands.
3731316 3732597 But I never said you have a job.
3733226 3734226 Meat.
3734445 3735934 I'll send you a nice box<br />of Christmas meat,
3735958 3737227 best I can do. Get outta here.
3737251 3738739 Bring me more photos.
3740325 3741670 Hi.<br />Hi.
3741743 3744154 Mr. Jameson told me<br />to give that to you.
3746248 3747779 Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
3747803 3748919 Thank you.
3749918 3751294 I'm Peter Parker.
3753797 3755091 I'm a photographer.
3756758 3757758 Yes.
3757810 3759062 I can see that.
3767019 3768647 As of today,
3769021 3770468 OSCORP lndustries,
3770624 3773156 has surpassed Quest Aerospace
3773275 3776554 as the principal supplier<br />to the United States military.
3777863 3780116 In short, ladies and gentlemen<br />of the board...
3780866 3782188 costs are down,
3782725 3783890 revenues are up,
3784286 3785316 and our stock,
3785577 3786904 has never been higher.
3787289 3788653 Wonderful news Norman.
3788677 3789677 Wonderful.
3789858 3791778 In fact, it's the reason<br />for selling the company.
3792794 3793459 What?
3793581 3796703 Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing<br />in the wake of the bombing.
3797355 3798355 Expanding.
3799384 3801761 They made a tender offer<br />we can't ignore.
3802304 3803471 Why wasn't I told?
3803639 3806087 Last thing they want<br />is a power struggle,
3806426 3807879 with entrenched management.
3808278 3810184 The deal is off if you come with it.
3810479 3813364 The board expects<br />your resignation in 30 days.
3814184 3816144 You can't do this to me.
3819088 3821012 I started this company.
3822574 3824777 You know how much I sacrificed?
3828830 3829830 Max.
3829968 3831296 Please.<br />Norman,
3831678 3833741 the board is unanimous.
3834836 3838100 We're announcing the sale<br />after the World Unity Festival.
3839007 3840053 I'm sorry.
3841510 3842905 You're out, Norman.
3853522 3854646 Am I?
3859236 3862279 Welcome to OSCORP lndustries<br />Unity Day Festival!
3862322 3864986 Let's hear it for Macy Gray.
3902195 3903195 MJ,
3904163 3905698 why didn't you wear the black dress?
3906742 3908815 Just, I wanted to impress my father.
3909225 3910411 He loves black.
3910579 3912944 Well, maybe he'll be impressed<br />no matter what.
3913927 3915199 You think I'm pretty.
3915667 3917075 I think you're beautiful.
3930849 3932046 MJ, would you do me a favor?
3932070 3934312 I... forgot my drink inside.<br />Come on.
3944321 3945685 Hi, Mr. Fargas.
3945709 3946709 Harry.
3947532 3949105 Have you seen my father around?
3950047 3952875 Well, I'm not sure if he's coming today.
3964716 3965747 What is that?
3966130 3967483 Must be new this year.
3972513 3973513 What is that?
3973594 3974677 That's our glider!
3985932 3987391 What the hell was that?
4015726 4017143 Code three! Code three!

4057017 4058047 Mary Jane!
4058071 4059071 Harry!
4062230 4063970 Hello, my dear.

4079509 4080509 Billy!
4083919 4085845 Somebody help him!
4086463 4087713 No!
4089508 4090508 Mommy!
4093053 4094167 Hold it right there!
4094191 4095420 I surrender.
4095526 4096377 Boy.
4096402 4097402 Hold it right there!
4104271 4105272 Impressive.

4130536 4131662 Help!
4131686 4133125 Someone please help me!
4158243 4159243 Hold on!
4160954 4161954 Watch out!
4171089 4172662 We'll meet again,
4173014 4174557 Spider-Man!
4176469 4177581 Hold on, Mary Jane!
4220388 4221043 Well,
4221208 4222622 beats taking the subway.
4223266 4225528 Don't mind us.<br />She just needs to use the elevator.
4226451 4227451 Wait.
4227979 4228979 Who are you?
4229397 4230761 You know who I am.
4230933 4231933 I do?
4232145 4233894 Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
4246539 4247539 Incredible?
4248582 4249936 What do you mean he's incredible?
4251640 4253200 No. Alright, wait.
4253224 4254616 Stay there. I'm gonna come over.
4255924 4257138 No, I'm gonna come o...
4257926 4258998 Alright. Fine.
4259022 4261006 Fine, will you call me in the morning,<br />and, and...
4261554 4263170 we'll go and have breakfast and...
4264269 4265936 I wanna buy you something.
4267268 4269298 Because I want to.<br />It'll make you feel better.
4271523 4272523 Ok.
4272774 4273774 And...
4274036 4275297 what do you mean, incredible?
4278029 4279018 Alright. I'm sorry.
4279042 4280042 Sleep tight.
4280573 4281877 Don't let the bedbugs...
4288081 4289278 She's alright.<br />She's...
4289302 4290823 just a little rattled.
4292486 4295283 Look Pete, I should have<br />told you about us.
4297757 4299540 But you should know<br />I'm crazy about her.
4300552 4302334 It's just you know,<br />you never made a move.
4304681 4305681 You're right.
4307100 4308100 I didn't.
4312542 4314240 I'm gonna get some rest.
4316276 4317990 I'm gonna stay up for a while.
4319612 4320834 What was that thing?
4321948 4322948 I don't know.
4324701 4326864 Whatever it is,<br />somebody has to stop it.
4343970 4345134 Somebody there?
4345889 4347524 Somebody?
4349267 4350313 Who said that?
4351478 4354164 Don't play the innocent with me.
4357275 4359320 You've known all along.
4363948 4365080 Where are you?
4365492 4369166 Follow the cold shiver<br />running down your spine.
4376419 4377431 I'm right here.
4380006 4381196 I don't understand.
4383009 4385978 Did you think it was coincidence?
4386429 4390158 So many good things,<br />all happening for you.
4390234 4391756 All for you,
4392189 4393431 Norman.
4396356 4397356 What do you want?
4398316 4400228 To say what you won't.
4400652 4402754 To do what you can't.
4403363 4404769 To remove...
4405058 4407129 those in your way.
4411913 4413112 The board members.
4415569 4416569 You killed them.
4416709 4418108 We killed them.
4418670 4419670 We?
4419838 4420877 Remember?
4421548 4424216 Your little accident in the laboratory.
4426219 4427845 The performance enhancers.
4428012 4428918 Bingo.
4428942 4429942 Me!
4430570 4432625 Your greatest creation.
4433560 4436850 Bringing you what you've always wanted.
4437522 4440522 Power, beyond your wildest dreams.
4440547 4442491 And it's only the beginning.
4444571 4446101 There's only one...
4447016 4448500 who can stop us.
4449701 4452602 Or imagine if he joined us.
4458001 4459031 Spider-Man.
4459615 4461086 And the Green Goblin.
4461254 4462743 The Green Goblin. You like that?
4462767 4464207 Made it up myself.<br />Mr. Jameson.
4464522 4466371 These weirdos all gotta have a name now.
4466396 4467746 Mr. Jameson, Spider-Ma...
4467771 4468771 Hoffman!<br />Yeah?
4470867 4472837 Call the patent office,<br />copyright the name Green Goblin,
4472861 4474621 I want a quarter every<br />time somebody says it.
4474684 4476070 How about Green Meanie?
4476892 4478843 Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.
4478867 4480249 He was trying to save it. That's slander.
4480273 4482125 It is not. I resent that.
4482609 4483848 Slander is spoken.
4484020 4485153 In print, it's libel.
4485820 4487676 You don't trust anybody,<br />that's your problem.
4487906 4489106 I trust my barber.
4490525 4492151 What are you, his lawyer?<br />Get outta here.
4492202 4494328 Let him sue me,<br />get rich like a normal person.
4494495 4495775 That's what made this country...
4504464 4505494 Jameson,
4505518 4507075 you slime.
4507589 4511166 Who's the photographer<br />who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?
4511304 4513404 I don't know who he is.<br />His stuff comes in the mail.
4513429 4515224 You're lying!<br />I swear.
4515336 4517693 He's the one who can bring me to him.
4517718 4518966 I don't know who he is.
4518990 4520624 You are useless.
4520649 4522374 Set him down tough guy.
4523191 4524617 Speak of the devil!
4524641 4526932 Spider-Man, I knew you two<br />were in this together!
4526956 4527593 I...
4527812 4530601 Hey kiddo, let Mom and Dad<br />talk for a minute, will you?
4530626 4533086 Sleep...
4547715 4549455 Wake up little spider.
4550199 4551199 Wake up.
4551886 4552886 No,
4553221 4554752 you're not dead...
4555088 4556088 yet.
4556516 4558486 Just paralyzed...
4558851 4560236 temporarily.
4561813 4564563 You're an amazing creature, Spider-Man.
4565288 4567861 You and I are not so different.
4568415 4569558 I'm not like you.
4570484 4571751 You're a murderer.
4572031 4573031 Well,
4573368 4574571 to each his own.
4575076 4576607 I chose my path,
4576631 4578201 you chose the way of the hero.
4578705 4581111 And they found you amusing<br />for a while,
4581443 4583021 the people of this city.
4583543 4586535 But the one thing they love<br />more than a hero...
4587005 4588744 is to see a hero fail,
4588768 4589578 fall,
4589602 4590602 die trying.
4591082 4593457 In spite of everything you've done for<br />them,
4593481 4595124 eventually, they will hate you.
4595430 4596430 Why bother?
4597170 4598671 Because it's right.
4599099 4600834 Here's the real truth.
4601894 4604521 There are eight million<br />people in this city.
4605232 4609401 And those teeming masses<br />exist for the sole purpose
4609763 4613572 of lifting the few exceptional<br />people onto their shoulders.
4614068 4615068 You, me,
4615632 4617031 we're exceptional.
4617910 4622581 I could squash you<br />like a bug right now.
4622790 4624697 But I'm offering you a choice.
4625604 4626601 Join me.
4626627 4630016 Imagine what we could<br />accomplish together.
4630423 4632524 What we could create.
4633760 4635392 Or we could destroy.
4636049 4639357 Because the deaths of countless<br />innocents in selfish
4639381 4642220 battle again and again and<br />again until we're both dead.
4642793 4644605 Is that what you want?
4646981 4648879 Think about it, hero.
4661829 4664403 In spite of everything<br />you've done for them,
4664427 4666465 eventually they will hate you.
4676302 4677302 Hey!
4677470 4678375 It's me again.
4678399 4679165 Hey!
4679347 4680509 How was your audition?
4680973 4682004 How'd you know?
4682028 4683571 The hot line. Your mom
4684143 4685680 told my aunt, told me.
4686562 4687981 So you just came by?
4688106 4689553 I was in the neighborhood.
4689577 4691262 Needed to see a friendly face.
4691901 4695612 I took two buses and a cab<br />to get in the neighborhood, but...
4696739 4697807 So how'd it go?
4700410 4702532 They said I needed acting lessons.
4703106 4705333 A soap opera told me<br />I needed acting lessons.
4707083 4708614 Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
4709115 4711158 The sky's the limit, up to $7
4711713 4712952 84 cents.
4713756 4715333 I'd like a cheeseburger.
4716622 4718707 But, I'm going out to dinner with Harry.
4720179 4721179 Come with us.
4721764 4722764 No, thanks.
4723504 4724680 How's it going with...
4726436 4727285 Never mind.
4727310 4728882 That's none of my business.
4729439 4730439 It's not?
4732358 4733577 Why so interested?
4734694 4735694 I'm not.
4736446 4737446 You're not?
4739449 4740938 Well, why would I be?
4741100 4742100 I don't know.
4742382 4743639 Why would you be?
4746122 4747207 I, that's a...
4748454 4749637 I don't know.
4752637 4754082 Sorry you won't come with us.
4757823 4759082 I better run, tiger.
4768125 4769265 Hey, check it out, man.
4770505 4771505 Come on, man.
4775735 4777679 Hey, where you going, baby?<br />Come on!
4796740 4797779 Get off me!
4831452 4832452 Wait!
4837964 4840003 You have a knack<br />for getting in trouble.
4840508 4842456 You have a knack for saving my life.
4843096 4844995 I think I have a superhero stalker.
4845096 4846775 I was in the neighborhood.
4848849 4849849 You are...
4850132 4851132 amazing.
4852436 4853872 Some people don't think so.
4856232 4857232 But you are.
4857788 4859234 Nice to have a fan.
4859986 4861953 Do I get to say thank you this time?
4864073 4865073 Wait.
4934255 4936216 I have to get in there! My baby's in there!
4936241 4937551 My baby's in there! Let me go!
4937575 4939176 I can't let you in there,<br />the roof's about to collapse!
4939200 4940846 Please save my baby!<br />I can't let you in there,
4940870 4942836 Somebody save my baby!<br />The roof's about to collapse!
4942860 4944194 Look! Up there!
4950868 4952661 Save my baby, please!
4976352 4977352 No!
4985236 4986600 It's ok. Your baby's fine.
4987079 4988290 My baby!
4990282 4991897 God bless you, Spider-Man.
4992368 4993321 Bless you.
4993346 4995161 There he's! Don't let him get away!
4995371 4996777 Hold it! Hold it right there!
4997056 4998689 You're under arrest. I'm taking you in.
4998736 5000885 My God, there's<br />somebody still up there!
5003295 5004295 I'm going.
5006590 5008163 I'll be here when you get back.
5008187 5009634 Not coming back, chief.
5010052 5011177 Go! Go!
5020104 5021135 Where are you?
5023822 5025127 Where are you?
5030823 5032112 I'm gonna get you out of here!
5035786 5036786 It's ok.
5044336 5046532 You're pathetically predictable.
5047174 5048775 Like a moth to the flame.
5049884 5052343 What about my generous proposal?
5053387 5054543 Are you in
5054567 5055876 or are you out?
5056432 5058004 It's you who's out, Gobby.
5058296 5059296 Out of your mind.
5059513 5060817 Wrong answer.
5062772 5063772 Great.
5102937 5105136 No one says no to me!
5113072 5115020 MJ, will you stop goofing around?
5115044 5116491 Harry, relax.
5119204 5120245 He's here.
5121038 5122038 Are you ready?
5122389 5123389 Yeah.
5124109 5125447 Aunt May.
5125580 5126886 I'm sorry I'm late.
5127253 5128366 Work was murder.
5129038 5130523 I picked up a fruitcake.
5130548 5131722 Why thank you Mr. Osborn.
5131747 5133028 We're so glad you could come.<br />You look great.
5133052 5134052 Thanks.
5134218 5136169 Who is this lovely young lady?
5137096 5139294 MJ, I'd like you to meet<br />my father, Norman Osborn.
5139318 5141021 Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.
5141046 5142380 Hi.<br />How do you do?
5142404 5144325 I've been looking forward to meeting you.
5144478 5145842 Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
5145866 5148189 Now, where is Peter?
5148568 5150776 He'd better have remembered<br />that cranberry sauce.
5156453 5157229 That's...
5157422 5158883 weird, I didn't know he was here.
5163080 5164080 Peter?
5169314 5170314 Peter?
5172631 5173719 Is that you?
5177774 5178774 Pete?
5179805 5181169 How strange.
5181194 5182625 There's nobody here.
5190441 5191930 Bit of a slob, isn't he?
5192016 5194148 All brilliant men are.
5227659 5228675 Hey, everyone.
5229386 5230177 Peter!
5230202 5232150 Peter!<br />Sorry I'm late, it's a jungle out there.
5232175 5234841 Had to beat an old lady with<br />a stick to get these cranberries.
5236612 5237642 Thank you.
5237666 5239447 Now then, everybody sit down
5239685 5241269 and we can say grace.
5242675 5243675 Parker.
5244745 5246496 Here we go.
5253462 5254576 There we are.
5254600 5256165 It looks delicious.
5256298 5257298 Norman.
5259593 5261016 Will you do the honors?
5273565 5274846 Why Peter,
5274955 5276546 you're bleeding.
5279538 5280538 Yeah.
5280759 5282645 I stepped off a kerb and...
5283087 5284993 got clipped<br />by one of those bike messengers.
5285129 5286540 Well, let me see.
5286912 5288496 Oh my goodness.
5288664 5290982 That looks awful.<br />No, it's nothing.
5291250 5292864 I'll get the first-aid kit.
5292958 5294561 Then we'll say grace.
5294586 5297369 This is the boys' first Thanksgiving<br />in this apartment
5297393 5299918 and we<br />are going to do things properly.
5300843 5302881 How did you say that happened?
5304346 5305439 Bike messenger.
5306265 5307478 Knocked me down.
5313605 5315303 If you'll excuse me I've...
5315506 5317355 got to be going.<br />Wh... Why?
5318193 5319307 Something...
5319708 5321419 has come to my attention.
5321780 5322780 Are you alright?
5323161 5324646 I'm fine, just fine.
5324670 5327005 Thank you, Mrs. Parker.<br />Everyone.
5327369 5328441 Enjoy the fruitcake.
5328621 5329621 Dad!
5331076 5332076 Dad!
5332193 5333193 What are you doing?
5333474 5336013 I plan this whole thing so you can<br />meet MJ and now you have to leave?
5336037 5337044 I've got to go.
5338085 5339577 This girl is important to me.
5339601 5341998 Harry, please. Look at her.
5342360 5346225 Do you think a woman like that's sniffing<br />around because she likes your personality?
5346472 5347472 What are you saying?
5347970 5349512 Your mother was beautiful too.
5349537 5350704 They're all beautiful.
5350976 5355063 Until they're snarling after your trust<br />fund like a pack of ravening wolves.
5355272 5356564 You're wrong about her, Dad.
5357066 5360234 A word to the not-so-wise<br />about your little girlfriend.
5360444 5363112 Do what you need to with her,<br />then broom her fast.
5374750 5376515 Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.
5377461 5378461 You heard?
5379000 5380232 Everyone heard that creep.
5380318 5382036 That creep is my father.
5382060 5384481 Alright, If I'm lucky, I'll<br />become half of what he is.
5384760 5387200 So just keep your mouth shut<br />about stuff you don't understand!
5387225 5389114 Harry Osborn!
5389764 5391045 I'm sorry, Aunt May.
5394856 5398192 Spider-Man is all but invincible.
5398524 5399762 But Parker,
5400435 5402014 we can destroy him.
5402301 5403301 I can't.
5403362 5406190 Betrayal must not be countenanced.
5406615 5407395 Parker...
5407419 5408866 must be educated.
5411674 5412513 What do I do?
5412538 5416345 Instruct him in the matters<br />of loss and pain.
5416792 5418031 Make him suffer.
5418126 5420118 Make him wish he were dead.
5420525 5421379 Yes?
5421547 5423464 And then grant his wish.
5424704 5425704 But how?
5425884 5430179 The cunning warrior attacks<br />neither body nor mind.
5430389 5431556 Tell me how!
5431723 5433891 The heart, Osborn.
5434143 5437186 First, we attack his heart.
5439064 5442674 Give us this day our daily bread,<br />and forgive us our trespasses
5442947 5445760 as we forgive those who<br />trespassed against us.
5446029 5449057 Lead us not into temptation,<br />but deliver us...
5457754 5460297 Deliver us!
5460483 5461668 Finish it!
5462004 5463034 Finish it!
5463059 5465434 From evil!
5475601 5476851 Get the BP.
5477190 5478190 Aunt May!
5478354 5479425 Is she gonna be ok?
5479449 5481290 What happened? What happened?<br />Yes, she's going to be ok.
5481314 5482361 Look, you're going to have to leave.
5482385 5483263 Right now.<br />What happened?
5483380 5484552 Those eyes!
5484632 5487095 Those horrible yellow eyes!
5493368 5494727 He knows who I am.
5539873 5540873 I'm sorry.
5545170 5546349 Will she be ok?
5546374 5547716 She's gonna be fine.
5547741 5549396 She's been sleeping all day.
5551468 5552540 Thanks for coming.
5553134 5554163 Of course.
5558392 5559392 How are you?
5559686 5561427 You ok about the other night?
5561452 5562452 Yeah, I'm fine. I...
5563170 5565121 I just felt bad<br />about leaving Aunt May.
5565399 5566512 Have you talked to Harry?
5566865 5567865 He called me.
5569006 5570361 I haven't called him back.
5573073 5574200 The fact is...
5576341 5577774 I'm in love with somebody else.
5578091 5578786 You are?
5578891 5580184 At least, I think I am.
5582833 5584848 It's not the right time to talk about it.<br />No, no.
5584873 5585873 Go on.
5586044 5588270 Would I know his name, this guy?
5589809 5591863 You'll think I'm a stupid<br />little girl with a crush.
5592551 5593574 Trust me.
5594177 5595254 It's funny.
5597431 5599295 He's saved my life twice,
5599319 5601054 and I've never even seen his face.
5602281 5603281 Him.
5603828 5604938 You're laughing at me.<br />No. No.
5604962 5606302 No, I understand.
5606812 5608249 He is extremely cool.
5608274 5611195 But do you think it's true, all the<br />terrible things they say about him?
5611220 5612183 No, no.
5612207 5615140 Not Spider-Man,<br />not a chance in the world.
5615907 5617131 I know him a little bit.
5617743 5620139 I'm sort of his<br />unofficial photographer.
5620829 5622402 Has he mentioned me?
5623188 5624188 Yeah.
5624291 5625372 What'd he say?
5626405 5627405 I said...
5628754 5630283 He asked me...
5631332 5632660 what I thought about you.
5634293 5635441 And what did you say?
5636720 5637720 I said...
5640176 5642171 Spider-Man. I said...
5643575 5645559 The great thing about MJ...
5646385 5647385 Is...
5648690 5649690 When you...
5650062 5651346 look in her eyes,
5654488 5656416 and she's looking back in yours,
5658700 5659856 everything...
5660325 5661325 feels...
5662913 5664246 Not quite normal.
5665999 5667217 Because you feel...
5668335 5669467 stronger...
5671505 5672535 and weaker...
5673264 5674576 at the same time.
5676199 5677631 You feel excited...
5679296 5680701 and at the same time...
5681848 5682958 Terrified.
5685811 5687383 The truth is you...
5687891 5689934 you don't know what you feel,
5691525 5694122 except you know what<br />kind of man you want to be.
5697864 5699294 It's as if you've...
5700367 5701367 reached...
5701723 5703137 the unreachable...
5705122 5706746 and you weren't ready for it.
5711294 5712465 You said that?
5713839 5715708 Well, something like that.
5746339 5747339 Hey.
5760469 5761469 Dad?
5767309 5768765 Dad, is that you?
5775984 5776984 What is it?
5779910 5781310 Well, you were right about MJ.
5782175 5783667 You're right about everything.
5785884 5787261 She's in love with Peter.
5788747 5789747 Parker?
5790168 5790609 Yeah.
5790879 5792512 And how does he feel about her?
5795253 5797456 He's loved her since the 4th grade.
5798757 5800413 He pretends like he doesn't, but...
5800811 5802654 there's no one Peter cares for more.
5806932 5808022 I'm so sorry.
5811144 5813330 I haven't always been<br />there for you, have I?
5816358 5818723 You're busy.<br />You're an important man. I...
5818747 5819747 I understand.
5819778 5821217 That's no excuse.
5822493 5823865 I'm proud of you.
5824908 5828418 I've lost sight of that somewhere.<br />But I'm gonna make it up to you, Harry.
5829955 5833348 I'm going to rectify certain inequities.
5847347 5849027 Wake up, little spider.
5849236 5850277 Wake up.
5852143 5853519 Go home, dear.
5853851 5855185 You look awful.
5855480 5857773 And you look beautiful.<br />Well, thank you.
5857983 5859358 I don't like to leave you here.
5859383 5860858 But I'm safe here.
5861444 5862808 Can I do anything for you?
5862832 5864154 You do too much.
5864322 5865478 College, a job,
5865693 5868530 all this time with me.<br />You're not Superman, you know.
5870620 5872343 A smile. Finally.
5872398 5875741 Haven't seen one of those on your<br />face since Mary Jane was here.
5875810 5876810 Hey.
5876861 5878872 You were supposed to be asleep.
5880028 5884379 You know, you were about 6 years old<br />when MJ's family moved in next door.
5885135 5886707 And when she got out of the car,
5886861 5889096 and you saw her for the first time,
5889264 5891879 you grabbed me and said,<br />Aunt May,
5891903 5893089 Aunt May,
5893759 5895415 is that an angel?
5895812 5897009 Gee, did I say that?
5897454 5898884 You sure did.
5901988 5902442 Well,
5902946 5904259 Harry's in love with her.
5904988 5906394 She's still his girl.
5906901 5908511 Well, isn't that up to her?
5908950 5910856 She doesn't really know who I am.
5911495 5913167 Because you won't let her.
5913747 5916175 You're so mysterious all the time.
5917125 5918125 Tell me,
5918331 5920025 would it be so dangerous
5920050 5923316 to let Mary Jane know<br />how much you care?
5924466 5926967 Everybody else knows.
5930013 5931263 I'll be right back.
5931931 5932931 But...
5940565 5942003 Come on, pick up.
5942617 5943617 Hi...<br />Hey MJ!
5943642 5944992 Sing your song at the beep.
5947072 5948516 MJ, it's Peter. You there?
5949258 5950258 Hello?
5950516 5951516 You there?
5952744 5954628 Well, I'm just calling<br />to check up on you.
5954652 5956398 Will you call me when you get in, ok?
5957297 5958297 Alright, well...
5959000 5960000 Don't...
5960992 5962530 Don't go up any dark alleys.
5963505 5964505 Hello?
5967786 5970426 Can Spider-Man come out to play?
5971346 5972549 Where is she?
6019484 6021151 What is that?<br />That's cool!
6047005 6048714 Goblin, what have you done?
6091020 6092079 Spider-Man!
6092306 6095150 This is why only fools are heroes.
6095470 6097180 Because you never know,
6097263 6101360 when some lunatic will come<br />along with a sadistic choice.
6103144 6105633 Let die the woman you love?
6110109 6111109 Or...
6112277 6114859 Suffer the little children.
6117465 6118272 Spider-Man!
6118296 6119543 Save us!
6120578 6122075 Save us!
6123081 6125666 Make your choice, Spider-Man.
6125875 6129136 And see how a hero is rewarded.
6129349 6130605 Don't do it, Goblin!
6131673 6134068 We are who we choose to be.
6134609 6135944 Now, choose!
6135969 6137023 No!
6166291 6167655 Everybody stay still!
6177385 6178553 Ahoy up there!
6178957 6181875 We're gonna bring<br />the barge right under you.
6189532 6190532 He's coming back!
6190907 6191907 Listen.
6192094 6193442 I need you to climb down.
6193467 6194306 I can't.
6194330 6195330 Yes, you can!
6200199 6201730 MJ, you can do it.
6201933 6202933 You have to!
6203293 6204293 Trust me.
6206497 6207611 Hold on tight
6208215 6209215 and go quickly.
6214672 6215672 Hurry!
6215929 6217024 I can't. I can't do it!
6217049 6218422 Hang on, Mary Jane!
6247038 6249186 He's not gonna make it.<br />He's gonna make it!
6259550 6261411 It's time to die.
6269769 6272587 Come on up here, tough guy!<br />I got a little something for ya!
6272612 6273860 We ought to kick your freaking ass!
6273884 6275095 Leave Spider-Man alone!
6275119 6277279 You gonna pick on a guy trying<br />to save a bunch of kids?
6277860 6279605 Yeah, I got something for your ass!
6279630 6281506 You mess with Spidey,<br />you mess with New York!
6281531 6283991 You mess with one of us,<br />you mess with all of us!
6297588 6299038 Spider-Man, watch out!
6331247 6333576 Misery, misery, misery.
6333601 6335209 That's what you've chosen.
6336419 6338224 I offered you friendship,
6339111 6340987 and you spat in my face.
6392183 6395308 You've spun your last web, Spider-Man.
6396020 6399665 Had you not been so selfish,<br />your little girlfriend's death
6399690 6401233 would have been quick and painless.
6401258 6404275 But now that<br />you've really pissed me off,
6405029 6406768 I'm gonna finish her,
6407221 6410091 nice and slow.
6414497 6416074 MJ and I...
6417375 6420473 We're gonna have a hell of a time.
6474386 6475676 Peter, stop!
6476184 6477184 Stop!
6477226 6478324 It's me.
6487612 6488784 Mr. Osborn.
6489136 6490558 Peter, thank God for you.
6491355 6493325 You killed those people<br />on that balcony.
6493417 6495800 The Goblin killed!<br />I had nothing to do with it!
6496175 6498284 Don't, don't let him take me again.
6498664 6500707 I beg you. Protect me.
6500875 6503017 You tried to kill Aunt May.
6503042 6504419 You tried to kill Mary Jane.
6504629 6505676 But not you.
6506797 6508328 I tried to stop it,
6508793 6510567 but I couldn't stop it.
6510968 6512457 I would never hurt you.
6513262 6514699 I knew from the beginning...
6515389 6517613 If anything ever happened to me...
6517983 6520293 It was you that I could count on.
6520811 6524147 You, Peter Parker,<br />would save me and so you have.
6524732 6525979 Thank God for you.
6527568 6528745 Give me your hand.
6530154 6531226 Believe in me...
6531609 6533232 as I believed in you.
6534694 6536536 I've been like a father to you.
6539330 6540997 Be a son to me now.
6542792 6544113 I have a father.
6545419 6547379 His name was Ben Parker.
6549799 6551799 Godspeed Spider-Man.<br />What?
6570194 6571194 Peter...
6574031 6575323 Don't tell Harry.
6607565 6608670 What have you done?
6609442 6610619 What have you done?
6634300 6635300 Hey.
6639180 6640507 I'm so sorry, Harry.
6642141 6644093 I know what it's like to lose a father.
6647438 6648635 I didn't lose him.
6648659 6650148 He was stolen from me.
6652318 6653968 One day, Spider-Man will pay.
6656489 6658897 I swear on my father's grave,<br />Spider-Man will pay.
6664622 6666171 Thank God for you, Peter.
6667166 6668687 You're the only family I have.
6694041 6695538 No matter what I do,
6696479 6698396 no matter how hard I try,
6700214 6701562 the ones I love
6702248 6704217 will always be the ones who pay.
6714880 6716771 You must miss him so much.
6718175 6720208 It's been so hard without him.
6724140 6726193 There's something<br />I've been wanting to tell you.
6728740 6730069 When I was up there,
6731425 6732945 and I thought I was gonna die...
6735776 6738218 There was only one person<br />who I was thinking of.
6740906 6743179 And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.
6745522 6746897 It was you Pete.
6748873 6750139 I kept thinking,
6751417 6753374 I hope I make it through this,
6755421 6758555 so I could see Peter Parker's<br />face one more time.
6761177 6762177 Really?
6763053 6764584 There's only one man,
6765576 6767685 who's always been there for me...
6770102 6771584 Who makes me feel...
6772521 6774981 like I'm more than I ever<br />thought I could be.
6778360 6779552 That I'm just...
6780696 6781696 Me.
6783282 6784383 And that's ok.
6787166 6788166 The truth is,
6790998 6791998 I love you.
6794877 6796476 I love you so much, Peter.
6817525 6818721 All I wanted,
6819009 6821298 was to tell<br />her how much I loved her...
6822488 6823488 I can't.
6826534 6827601 You can't what?
6829203 6830249 Tell you...
6832373 6833903 Everything. I mean...
6834952 6836626 there's so much to tell.
6837795 6838795 Yeah.
