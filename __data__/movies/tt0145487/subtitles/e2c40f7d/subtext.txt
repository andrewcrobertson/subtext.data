230106 231982 Tell him to stop! Please!
232149 232993 Stop!
233465 235557 Hey! Stop the bus!
235736 236599 Stop the bus!
236623 239025 He's been chasing us<br />since Woodhaven Boulevard.
239240 240491 Catch a cab, Parker!
244954 246510 Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.
253170 254422 What a geek!
255131 256536 Don't even think about it.
256560 258607 You're so lame, Parker.
259510 261262 Would you date him?
278988 280586 Midtown High seniors.
281365 282645 No wandering.
283078 284538 Proceed direct. Knock it off.
285327 288374 Remember, it is a privilege to be here.
289206 292501 We're guests of Columbia<br />University's Science Department.
292526 294143 So behave accordingly.
295045 297466 Let's not have a repeat<br />of our trip to the planetarium.
298299 299925 Come on, people, stay together.
300092 302349 Proceed up the steps<br />and into the building.
304180 306459 Where were you?<br />Checking out the library.
307391 309328 Looking at the books.<br />Yeah, right.
311984 314064 Charles, can we drive<br />around the corner, please?
314231 314906 Why?
315733 317526 The entrance is right there.
317693 321405 Dad, these are public-school kids.<br />I'm not showing up in the Rolls.
321572 324154 What, you want me to trade in<br />my car for a Jetta...
324179 327219 because you flunked out of every<br />private school I sent you to?
327244 328274 It wasn't for me.
328400 329556 Of course it was.
330890 332725 Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
332750 334314 I'm not ashamed of who I am.
335461 336336 It's just...
336879 337906 Just what, Harry?
338589 339507 Forget it.
342866 343773 Pete!
344845 346514 Hi, Harry.<br />Hey, man. What's up?
346680 347436 Harry.
348224 349420 Won't you be needing this?
349873 350863 Thanks, Dad.
351520 353771 Peter, may I introduce<br />my father, Norman Osborn.
354122 355552 I've heard so much about you.
355665 357011 Great honor to meet you, sir.
357035 359125 Harry says you're a science whiz.
359276 359931 You know,
359955 362112 I'm something of a scientist myself.
362279 365449 I read all your research on nanotechnology.<br />Really brilliant.
365616 366729 And you understood it?
366753 368702 Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
368869 369816 Impressive.
370172 371914 Your parents must be very proud.
372088 373881 I live with my aunt and uncle.<br />They are.
374127 376713 Hey, you two! Let's move!
377044 378074 Nice to meet you.
378637 379785 Hope to see you again.<br />Yeah.
383050 384455 He doesn't seem so bad.
384636 386144 Not if you're a genius.
386595 388196 I think he wants to adopt you.
388847 390670 There are over 32,000,
390694 393391 known species of spiders in the world.
393769 395550 They're in the order <i>Araneae,</i>
395791 397540 divided into three suborders.
397738 398769 That's amazing!
399024 403112 This is the most advanced electron<br />microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.
403279 404336 It's unreal.
405489 406477 Arachnids,
406501 407961 from all three groups possess,
407986 411383 varying strengths which help<br />them in their constant search for food.
411870 412775 For example,
412799 414402 the Delena spider,
414568 416104 family <i>Sparassidae</i>...
416584 417822 has the ability,
417971 420044 to jump to catch its prey.
420921 422076 For the school paper?
427177 428541 Next we have,
428723 430084 the net web spider,
430505 432224 family <i>Filistatidae</i>...
432497 434137 genus <i>Kukulcania</i>.
434476 436883 It spins an intricate funnel shaped web
437397 439382 whose strands have a tensile strength,
439649 442430 proportionately equal to a type<br />of high tension wire
442455 444246 used in bridge building.
444778 446488 Leave him alone.<br />Or what?
446655 448931 Or his father will fire your father.
450034 451314 What's Daddy gonna do?
451338 452369 Sue me?
452536 454026 What is going on?
454739 456903 The next person who talks<br />will fail this course.
457216 458114 I kid you not.
458500 459871 This grass spider...<br />Let's go.
459973 461991 Hunts using a set of reflexes
462015 464808 with nerve conduction velocity so fast,
465049 468510 that some researchers believe<br />that it almost borders on precognition.
468718 470720 An early awareness of danger.<br />Those guys are jerks.
471054 472847 A spider-sense.
473473 474936 Hey, look at that spider.
475206 478944 Some spiders change colors<br />to blend into their environment.
479980 481474 It's a defense mechanism.
482065 483012 Peter,
483334 485359 what makes you think<br />I would want to know that?
485527 486412 Who wouldn't?
486489 488935 Over five painstaking years,
488959 491113 Columbia's genetic research facility...
491138 492355 You gonna talk to her now?
492379 495459 No. Come on. You talk to her.
495541 497459 Armed with these DNA blueprints...
497581 500433 we have now begun what<br />was once thought impossible.
500461 501572 Disgusting.
502055 503945 Yeah, hateful little things.
504337 505713 I love them!
506256 507274 Yeah, me too.
508884 509789 You know,
510226 512187 spiders can change their color...
512562 514711 to blend into their environment.
515257 516171 Really?
516933 519215 Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
520655 521404 Cool.<br />Yeah.
521429 524475 Transfer RNA to encode<br />an entirely new genome
524816 527943 combining the genetic information<br />rom all three spiders
528111 528766 into these,
528790 532282 15 genetically designed super-spiders.
532675 533784 There's 14.
534910 535846 I beg your pardon?
536453 537442 One's missing.
537934 538544 Yeah.
541917 544543 I guess the researchers<br />are working on that one.
545138 548473 Do you know that this is<br />the largest electron microscope
548498 549882 on the Eastern Seaboard?
549966 553270 You were talking throughout<br />that woman's entire presentation.
554179 555930 Let's go talk about how we listen.
560018 560715 Now,
560924 563596 I don't know what it's like<br />at those fancy private schools...
564314 566314 but at Midtown High...<br />112.5
572549 573229 Hey.
574829 576022 Could I take your picture?
576046 577775 I need one with a student in it.
578492 579776 Sure, yeah.
579800 580943 Great.<br />Where do you want me?
581561 582537 Over here?
582749 584083 Yeah. Yeah that's great.
584501 585772 Don't make me look ugly.
586731 588060 That's impossible.
595918 596754 Perfect.
604646 606042 Is that good?<br />Great.
611736 612682 That's great.
618702 620189 MJ, let's go!
622247 622777 Wait.
623400 624150 Thanks!
638305 639043 Parker,
639923 640626 let's do it.
657782 659480 We solved the horizon glide,
659636 661243 and the multi-G balance issues.
661411 663527 I've already seen the glider.
664372 666269 That's not what I'm here for.
666624 668545 General Slocum,<br />good to see you again.
670128 672296 Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.
672445 673244 Norman.
673338 674349 Mr. Osborn.
674549 678093 Always a pleasure to have our board<br />of directors pay us a little visit.
678303 681722 I want to see the progress report<br />on human performance enhancers.
681890 684647 We tried vapor inhalation<br />with rogue subjects,
684738 686393 they showed an 800% increase in strength!
686443 688319 800%? That's excellent.<br />Any side effects?
688605 689725 In one trial, yes.
689750 690678 It was an aberration.
690702 692546 All the tests since<br />then have been successful.
692692 694891 And in the trial that went wrong,<br />what happened?
694915 696242 What were the side effects?
696542 697351 Violence,
697734 698765 aggression...
699616 700765 and insanity.
701034 702148 And what do you recommend?
702172 703679 That was only one test.
704037 705776 With the exception of Dr. Stromm,
705800 707969 our entire staff certifies the product
708041 709488 ready for human testing.
709761 710946 Dr. Stromm?
712295 714568 We need to take the whole line<br />back to formula.
717217 718414 Back to formula?
718438 719459 Dr. Osborn.
720804 722184 I'm gonna be frank with you.
722889 724921 I never supported your program.
725239 727395 We have my predecessor<br />to thank for that.
727894 728466 Norman,
728490 730789 the general gave<br />the go-ahead to Quest Aerospace
730814 733332 to build a prototype<br />of their exoskeleton design.
734067 735348 They test in two weeks.
735372 738726 And if your so-called performance<br />enhancers have not had a...
738750 741676 successful human trial by that date,
742492 743814 I'm gonna pull your funding.
744283 745705 I'm going to give it to them.
748461 749978 Gentlemen. Ladies.
755422 757495 And the Lord said, Let there be light.
757519 758663 And voilà!
759226 760297 There is light.
761094 763257 Forty soft, glowing watts of it.
763346 765753 Good boy. God will be thrilled.
765956 767380 Just don't fall on your ass.
768518 770552 I'm already on my ass, May.
771162 774053 When the plant's senior electrician<br />is laid off after...
774313 777181 after 35 years,<br />what else would you call it?
777205 778787 I am on my ass.
778812 780437 Hand me that dish. The green one.
781124 784093 The corporation is<br />downsizing the people and...
784492 785866 upsizing their profits.
786619 788937 Ben, you'll get<br />another job somewhere.
790667 791362 Well...
791921 793544 let's look in the paper and see.
794586 796787 There are the want ads.<br />What do we got here?
797445 798600 Computer...
799382 800940 Computer salesman,
800964 803293 computer engineer, computer analyst.
803318 806409 My Lord, even the computers<br />need analysts these days.
807348 808879 May, I'm 68 years old.
808903 812644 I'm too old for computers and<br />besides, I have a family to provide for.
812854 814050 I love you.
814283 815731 And Peter loves you.
815982 819234 You're the most responsible man<br />I've ever known.
819486 821142 We've been down-and-out before.
821166 823002 But somehow, we survived.
823354 824080 Yeah.
825033 826063 Hi, sweetie.
826087 826897 You're just...
827510 829328 Just in time for dinner.
829537 830234 Hey.
830258 832080 How you doing, buddy?<br />How was the field trip?
832248 834240 I don't feel well.<br />I'm gonna go to sleep.
835071 836122 You won't have a bite?
836147 837685 No thanks. Had a bite.
838069 840296 Did, did you get some pictures, Peter?
841338 843319 I gotta crash. Everything's fine.
845428 846490 What's that all about?
868284 870494 <i>In this recombination lab,</i>
870662 875290 <i>we use synthesized transfer RNA<br />to encode an entirely new genome</i>
875500 878687 <i>combining the genetic<br />information from all three spiders</i>
878753 883062 <i>into these 15 genetically<br />designed super-spiders.</i>
898022 899220 Dr. Osborn, please.
899584 901740 The performance enhancers aren't ready.
902151 904408 The data just doesn't justify this test.
905655 907394 Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
907807 909158 We can't do this.
909492 911210 Don't be a coward.
912161 914746 Risks are part of laboratory science.
914956 916062 Let me reschedule,
916386 918667 with a proper medical staff<br />and a volunteer.
918760 921033 I mean if you just give me two weeks.<br />Two weeks?
921526 922480 In two weeks,
922505 925740 we'll have lost the contract<br />to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.
926049 926956 Sometimes,
926980 928701 you gotta do things yourself.
929095 930960 Get me the Promachloraperazine.
931260 932039 For what?
932064 935032 It begins catalyzation, when<br />the vapor hits the bloodstream.
938605 940361 40,000 years of evolution
940386 943814 and we've barely even tapped<br />the vastness of human potential.
958454 959572 That's cold.
1018101 1019101 Norman?
1023606 1024550 Norman!
1025973 1026738 Norman!
1035485 1036485 My God.
1038454 1039276 Oh my God!
1040055 1040789 Norman?
1042250 1044000 My God, Norman!
1046486 1047392 Norman!
1060768 1062227 Back to formula?
1096903 1097591 Weird.
1109442 1110817 Peter?<br />Yeah?
1111027 1112285 Are you alright?
1114697 1115689 I'm fine.
1116866 1118742 Any better this morning?<br />Any change?
1118910 1119861 Change?
1121287 1122067 Yep.
1122651 1123347 Big change.
1123372 1124611 Well, hurry up.
1124798 1126030 You're gonna be late.
1126171 1126930 Right.
1145770 1146609 Ok.
1151192 1152556 Goodness me!
1152580 1153390 Jeez.
1154228 1155798 I thought you were sick.
1156197 1157531 I got better.<br />You see?
1157556 1158520 Bye, guys.
1158544 1160747 You haven't eaten anything.<br />Have you got your lunch money?
1160772 1161479 Yeah, I got it.
1161504 1164610 Hey, Michelangelo, don't forget, we're<br />painting the kitchen right after school.
1164634 1166278 You got it?<br />Sure thing, Uncle Ben.
1166739 1167739 Don't start without me.
1167764 1169129 And don't start up with me.
1171462 1172409 Teenagers.
1172692 1174699 Raging hormones.<br />They never change.
1176520 1177900 Mary jane talk to me!
1177925 1179480 You're trash!<br />You're always gonna be trash!
1179505 1180418 Just like her!
1180443 1182325 I have to go to school.<br />Who's stopping you?
1201242 1201963 Hi, MJ.
1203786 1204663 Hey, MJ.
1205538 1207528 I don't know if you realize this,<br />but we've...
1208460 1211333 we've been neighbors since I was 6,<br />and I was wondering if maybe...
1212163 1213771 we could get together sometime?<br />Hey M.J?
1213796 1214991 I got the car. Hop in.
1215016 1216161 Maybe do something fun?<br />Hi guys!
1216710 1218256 Or I don't know.<br />Come on.
1218281 1221032 I thought it'd be time<br />to get to know each other.
1222430 1223319 Or not.
1229145 1231074 Sorry Parker, the bus is full!<br />Hey!
1232059 1232622 Hey!
1233232 1235207 Stop the bus!<br />Catch a cab!
1236234 1237296 Tell him to stop.
1238654 1240086 Check him out!<br />Dork!
1263137 1263754 Dad!
1264847 1265294 Dad!
1265419 1266340 Are you alright?
1267558 1268301 Harry.
1272188 1273709 What are you doing on the floor?
1274248 1275287 I don't know.
1276525 1277842 Have you been there all night?
1280863 1282113 Last night I was...
1284450 1285164 What?
1286953 1288820 I don't remember.<br />Mr. Osborn?
1288871 1290945 Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.
1291415 1292696 Sorry, my father's not feeling well.
1292720 1293947 Mr. Osborn...
1294374 1295609 Dr. Stromm is dead.
1295852 1296571 What?
1296941 1298827 They found his body<br />this morning in the lab.
1299485 1300682 He's been murdered, sir.
1300820 1301997 What are you talking about?
1302219 1303844 And the flight suit and the glider...
1304345 1305125 What about it?
1305149 1306429 It's been stolen, sir.
1332373 1333600 Great reflexes!
1335001 1335656 Thanks.
1335680 1336826 No problem.
1338254 1339117 Hey you...
1339332 1340244 have blue eyes.
1340268 1342173 I... Ididn't notice without your glasses.
1342925 1344355 You just get contacts?
1351350 1352214 Well,
1352432 1353287 see you.
1395311 1396383 What happened?
1396990 1398076 He's freaking weird.
1399273 1400648 Did you see that?
1402234 1403171 Parker?
1435810 1437849 It's a fight!<br />Think you're pretty funny, don't you freak?
1437874 1439468 Flash, it was just an accident.
1439492 1441457 My fist breaking your<br />teeth, that's the accident.
1441482 1442888 Come on Flash, stop.
1442912 1444192 I don't wanna fight you, Flash.
1444217 1445640 I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.
1445906 1446919 Kick his ass.
1467049 1468091 Help him, Harry.
1473055 1474246 How'd he do that?
1475558 1476410 Which one?
1477059 1478003 He's all yours, man.
1493951 1495314 Flash, get up!
1497288 1499338 Jesus Parker, you are a freak.
1501000 1503062 Peter, that was amazing.
1504753 1506284 I'm out of here. Come on.
1509792 1510714 Peter.
1611764 1612420 Go, web!
1614571 1615490 Fly.
1617783 1619139 Up, up and away, web.
1621471 1622284 Shazam!
1623294 1623944 Go!
1624120 1624628 Go!
1624873 1625901 Go, web, go!
1659825 1660887 Tallyho.
1705496 1707916 Is she back with the beer yet?<br />What?
1708290 1709540 Come here, bring me some beer!
1709750 1711072 Get up off your ass!
1711096 1712293 I paid for beer...
1712318 1713818 Stop yelling!<br />Stop it!
1713988 1715368 You're as stupid as your mother.
1715392 1716323 Get away from me!
1716632 1718216 You are drunk, do you know that?
1718384 1720094 Where's she going?<br />Where you going?
1720119 1720853 Where you going?
1721235 1722459 Stop, look!
1722483 1723793 These dishes are not done.
1723817 1725348 Somebody's gotta do the dishes!
1725557 1727297 Why don't you do them?
1727321 1729705 Get in here little girl<br />and you do the dishes, now!
1729760 1732947 You do them. They're yours, anyway.<br />I'm going out!
1733399 1734596 Were you listening to that?
1734620 1735445 No.
1736235 1737974 Well I heard, but I was just...
1738130 1739619 taking out the trash.
1739655 1741133 I guess you can always hear us.
1741636 1742254 Well,
1742637 1744063 everybody shouts.
1745240 1746490 Your aunt and uncle don't.
1747162 1749545 They can scream<br />pretty good sometimes.
1751667 1752311 Listen,
1752680 1754115 MJ, about today
1754969 1756105 at school with Flash...
1756130 1757570 You really freaked us out.
1757965 1758828 I'm sorry.
1759133 1760039 Is he ok?
1760509 1763088 He's just happy you didn't give him<br />a black eye for graduation.
1767558 1769284 So where are you going<br />after you graduate?
1772885 1773698 I...
1775524 1777291 I wanna move into the city.
1778735 1780016 And hopefully...
1780478 1781685 get a job as a...
1782321 1783306 photographer.
1783769 1785329 Work my way through college.
1787536 1788392 What about you?
1789037 1790420 Headed for the city too.
1791748 1793592 Can't wait to get out of here.
1795169 1795896 I wanna...
1797921 1798685 What?
1802259 1803081 No, come on.
1803909 1804621 Try me.
1805429 1806332 I wanna...
1808056 1808762 Act...
1810559 1811491 on stage.
1812561 1813358 Really?
1814771 1816139 That's perfect.
1817232 1819841 You were awesome<br />in all the school plays.
1820110 1820807 Really?
1820831 1821716 Yeah.
1822613 1825615 I cried like a baby<br />when you played Cinderella.
1826066 1827645 Peter, that was first grade.
1828668 1829348 Well...
1830719 1831762 even so.
1833332 1834535 Sometimes...
1836084 1837121 you know people.
1838921 1839951 You can just...
1840396 1841552 see what's coming.
1845594 1847247 What do you see coming for you?
1850753 1851840 I don't know.
1854937 1855967 Whatever it is,
1856842 1858723 it's something I never felt before.
1863124 1863683 And...
1864546 1865655 what for me?
1866078 1867030 For you?
1868948 1870523 You're gonna light up Broadway.
1873288 1874000 You know,
1878908 1880586 you're taller than you look.
1881797 1882610 I hunch.
1885592 1886219 Don't.
1890639 1891461 Hey, MJ!
1891849 1894201 Come take a ride<br />in my new birthday present.
1895269 1896115 Come on!
1897312 1898318 I gotta go.
1899554 1900241 Bye.
1901650 1904318 My God, it's gorgeous!<br />Yeah, right?
1904486 1906093 Look at it!<br />Hop in.
1906655 1908626 Oh my God! What a cool car!
1909157 1910110 Pretty tight?
1911159 1912982 Wait untill you hear the sound system.
1913006 1915055 Hey, don't scratch the leather.
1916999 1917952 Cool car.
2008654 2009474 Peter?
2011218 2013445 What's... What's going on in there?
2013470 2014500 I'm exercising.
2014524 2015810 I'm not dressed, Aunt May.
2016162 2016878 Well,
2017161 2019232 you're acting so strangely, Peter.
2020227 2021661 Ok. Thanks.
2053135 2054207 Something's bothering him.
2054457 2056470 Maybe he's too embarrassed<br />to tell me what it is.
2056638 2057752 Maybe I'm too embarrassed...
2058229 2059425 to ask him.
2060100 2061675 I just don't know anymore.
2062561 2064972 I'm going to the downtown library.<br />I'll see you later.
2064997 2065843 Yeah, wait Pete.
2065867 2067512 I'll drive you there, buddy.
2067536 2068557 No, I'll take the train.
2068582 2070014 No, no, no. I need the exercise.<br />Go on.
2070038 2071301 Go, go, go, go.
2082938 2084529 Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.<br />No, wait a minute.
2084553 2086398 Peter we need... we need to talk.
2086793 2087991 We can talk later.
2088360 2089618 Well, we can talk now.
2090563 2091586 If you let me.
2092048 2094258 What do we have to talk about?<br />Why now?
2094426 2096444 Because we haven't talked<br />at all for so long
2096469 2098694 your Aunt May and I don't<br />even know who you are anymore.
2098733 2100351 You shirk your chores.
2100726 2103797 You have all those weird experiments<br />in your room.
2104367 2107648 You start fights at school, you know.<br />I didn't start that fight, I told you that.
2107995 2109470 Well, you sure as hell finished it.
2109812 2111576 What was I supposed to do, run away?<br />No.
2111601 2113507 No, you're not supposed<br />to run away, but...
2114529 2115393 Pete, look.
2115417 2116310 You're changing.
2116334 2119116 I know, I went through exactly<br />the same thing at your age.
2119284 2120663 No. Not exactly.
2121142 2122093 Peter...
2122662 2125155 these are the years<br />when a man changes
2125383 2128531 into the man he's gonna<br />become the rest of his life.
2129882 2132175 Just be careful who you change into.
2134341 2136288 This guy, Flash Thompson.
2136606 2138844 He probably deserved what happened.
2139387 2141520 But just because you can beat him up,
2142557 2144002 doesn't give you the right to.
2145385 2146215 Remember,
2146689 2147925 with great power,
2148221 2150377 comes great responsibility.
2151316 2154223 Are you afraid that I'm gonna<br />turn into some kind of criminal?
2154698 2156230 Quit worrying about me, ok?
2156255 2157435 Something's different.
2157459 2158603 I'll figure it out.
2158627 2160204 Stop lecturing me, please.
2160205 2162482 I don't mean to lecture,<br />I don't mean to preach.
2163018 2164554 And I know I'm not your father...
2164579 2166236 Then stop pretending to be!
2171503 2172212 Right.
2175715 2177126 I'll pick you up here at 10.
2209040 2216118 Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
2219061 2220832 One, two, three.

2241489 2244607 is there no one here<br />man enough to stay in the ring
2244632 2249685 for three minutes<br />with this titan of testosterone?
2252748 2253912 Who?
2255044 2256271 I know who.
2257005 2261800 The Flying Dutchman!
2262268 2263145 Next.
2264429 2266804 There's no featherweight<br />division here, small fry
2267152 2267804 . Next.
2267891 2269124 No, no. Sign me up.
2270143 2270913 Ok.
2271718 2273747 You understand<br />the NYWL is not responsible
2273772 2275238 for any injury you may and
2275262 2277858 probably will sustain while<br />participating in said event?
2278026 2280277 And you are indeed participating<br />under your own free will?
2280445 2281070 Yes.
2281696 2282894 Down the hall to the ramp.
2282918 2284145 May God be with you.
2284735 2285491 Next.
2288078 2290046 Told you! Told you!

2299631 2303217 Bone Saw is ready!
2305637 2310037 Will the next victim please<br />enter the arena at this time?
2310517 2313716 If he can withstand just three minutes<br />in the cage
2313740 2318346 with Bone Saw McGraw,<br />the sum of $3000
2318370 2319858 will be paid to...
2320735 2321682 What's your name, kid?
2322081 2323323 The Human Spider.
2324322 2326699 The Human Spider, that's it?<br />That's the best you got?
2326866 2327480 Yeah.
2327504 2328756 That sucks.
2329160 2333664 The sum of $3000 will be paid to...
2333832 2335029 the terrifying,
2335053 2337084 the deadly,
2337335 2340802 the amazing Spider-Man!
2342924 2345551 My name's The Human Spider.<br />I don't care, get out there.
2345576 2348291 No, he got my name wrong.<br />Get out there, you moron.
2350934 2354155 Bone Saw will eat you up<br />and spit you out, little man.
2354180 2356061 I hope you brought<br />your mommy with you.
2356086 2359224 We'll break you!<br />You'll need someone to cry to.
2361067 2365593 I'm gonna rip all eight of your<br />feeble legs off one by one!
2366698 2368741 Oh my God!
2368950 2369989 My legs!
2370744 2372978 God. I can't feel my legs.

2385467 2386675 Cage!
2396019 2397478 Hello? Guys?
2398521 2403484 Will the guards please lock<br />the cage doors at this time?
2404194 2405099 Hey, listen.
2405475 2408248 This is some kind of mistake.<br />I didn't sign up for a cage match!
2408657 2409353 Hey!
2409625 2411105 Unlock the thing!
2411332 2412399 Take the chain off!
2412438 2413946 Hey, freak show!

2417165 2419087 I got you for three minutes.
2419646 2421939 Three minutes of playtime.
2428635 2431753 What are you doing up there?<br />Staying away from you.
2432305 2433544 That's a cute outfit.
2433568 2434890 Did your husband give it to you?
2442023 2443082 Finish him off!

2498101 2500659 Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!
2509591 2510734 Now get out of here.
2512886 2514083 A hundred bucks?
2514107 2515721 The ad said 3000.
2515930 2517686 Well, check it again, webhead.
2518474 2519880 It said three grand,
2520138 2522231 for three minutes.<br />And you pinned him in two.
2522562 2525536 For that, I give you 100<br />and you're lucky to get that.
2526107 2527482 I need that money.
2527942 2530233 I missed the part<br />where that's my problem.
2539120 2540693 Hey, what the hell?
2540842 2542209 Put the money in the bag.
2544174 2545139 Hurry up!
2551966 2554217 Hey! He stole the gate!
2554406 2555709 Stop that guy!
2556689 2558822 Stop him! He's got my money!
2559224 2560197 Thanks.
2561643 2563924 What the hell's the matter with you?<br />You let him go!
2564312 2566521 Cut him off in the lobby<br />and call the cops!
2566689 2568554 You could've taken that guy apart.
2568578 2570734 Now he's gonna get away<br />with my money.
2570902 2572913 I missed the part<br />where that's my problem.
2592674 2594314 Sir, you gotta get back.<br />Get back.
2594380 2596161 I can't see anything.<br />What happened?
2596844 2598002 Old dude, man.
2598429 2600054 Come on folks. Keep moving, please.
2600374 2601936 Please, keep moving. Let's go!
2602767 2605181 What happened?<br />Someone got hurt.
2607981 2608719 Excuse me.
2608743 2610554 Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
2610578 2611297 Stay back.
2611693 2613527 Hey, stay back! Stay back!<br />That's my uncle!
2615697 2616644 What happened?
2616668 2618142 Carjacker. He's been shot.
2618269 2620316 But we just called the paramedics.<br />They're on their way.
2622203 2623152 Uncle Ben?
2624497 2625379 Uncle Ben.
2629752 2630700 Uncle Ben?
2634716 2635405 Peter.
2637093 2638319 I'm here, Uncle Ben.
2644517 2645381 Peter.
2667707 2669113 They got the shooter.
2669137 2670879 He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.
2670960 2672658 We got three cars in pursuit.
2672908 2675306 Alright. Folks come on.<br />Come up. Move back.
2832788 2834789 Get a unit to the rear!
2837752 2839294 I got the back!
2852225 2853365 Who's there?
2879835 2880741 Don't hurt me.
2880765 2881950 Just give me a chance.
2881974 2883155 Just give me a chance!
2883224 2884328 What about my uncle?
2884352 2885829 Did you give him a chance?
2886256 2887053 Did you?
2887715 2888622 Answer me!
2892640 2894356 <i>Stop that guy!</i>
2899313 2900074 <i>Thanks.</i>
2911075 2911925 See you.
2933848 2934670 <i>Freeze!</i>
2934694 2936918 <i>We've got the place<br />completely surrounded.</i>
2979810 2981169 No. My God.
2984357 2986091 No.<br />My God. No!
2996410 2997482 Good evening General.
2998052 2998995 Good to see you.
3000164 3003041 Our exoskeleton's got<br />real firepower, General Slocum.
3003209 3007248 Well, if it does what you say it can,<br />I'll sign that contract tomorrow.
3009840 3012933 He's clear, let's go!<br />I assume you're confident about this test?
3012958 3013749 Absolutely.
3013773 3015425 Captain Curtis is our top pilot.
3016097 3018620 Now, what about<br />your commitment to OSCORP?
3019016 3022807 Nothing would please me more than<br />to put Norman Osborn out of business.
3025272 3026470 <i>Preflight complete.</i>
3027080 3027756 Mark.
3032446 3035188 <i>We are picking up an<br />unidentified object, closing fast.</i>
3035241 3036324 What the hell is that?
3036492 3037477 <i>Can you see anything?</i>
3038452 3039349 Oh my God!
3050089 3050911 Say chess.
3050935 3052232 Chess!
3053467 3054451 Peter!
3055553 3056333 Darling.
3056357 3059472 I'm so proud of you.<br />You looked so handsome up there.
3059640 3060295 Pete?
3060319 3063727 Good news. My father got the place<br />in New York, so we're all set this fall.
3063894 3065478 That's great.<br />You made it.
3068065 3070337 It's not the first time<br />I've been proven wrong.
3072987 3074696 Congratulations.<br />Thanks, Dad.
3075656 3077312 Peter, the science award.
3077516 3078551 That's terrific.
3078576 3079187 Yeah.
3082830 3085248 I know this has been<br />a difficult time for you
3086375 3088623 but I want you to try to enjoy this day.
3089837 3090951 Commencement.
3091547 3092911 The end of one thing.
3093694 3095076 The start of something new.
3097511 3098917 I don't want to be with you anymore.
3098941 3100675 Here's your ring.
3102057 3103432 You know what? Whatever.
3104477 3105455 Your loss.
3106645 3108051 You're like a brother to Harry.
3108439 3109682 That makes you family.
3110435 3112305 And if you ever need anything just...
3112485 3113427 give me a call.
3126745 3127440 Can I...
3128083 3129377 Can I fix you something?
3130503 3131432 No, thanks.
3176757 3178290 I missed him a lot today.
3181475 3182275 I know.
3184807 3185916 I miss him too.
3188394 3190103 But he was there.
3193899 3196348 I can't help thinking about...
3197506 3199248 the last thing I said to him.
3199327 3201436 He tried to tell me something<br />important,
3201943 3203732 and I threw it in his face.
3206078 3207466 You loved him
3209832 3211296 and he loved you.
3212960 3215554 He never doubted<br />the man you'd grow into.
3216797 3219070 How you were meant for great things.
3220801 3222303 You won't disappoint him.
3256670 3257868 <i>With great power...</i>
3258529 3260505 <i>comes great responsibility.</i>
3261008 3262205 <i>Remember that, Pete.</i>
3262651 3263802 <i>Remember that.</i>
3274229 3275262 Hurry up!
3287868 3288949 This is not a man.
3288974 3291547 My brother saw him building a<br />nest in the Lincoln Center Fountain.
3291789 3293069 I think he's human,
3293093 3295070 I think he's a man.<br />Could be a woman.
3298993 3299826 Bobby.
3299850 3301202 Get a load of this!
3305098 3306974 He throws up his hands,<br />ropes come out,
3307221 3309321 and he climbs up<br />the ropes like a spider web.
3309556 3311463 I see the web and it's his signature,
3311487 3313827 and I know Spider-Man was here.
3313852 3315300 The guy protects us, you know?
3315324 3316479 He protects the people.
3316647 3319399 Some kind of freakyloo or something.<br />Wackadoo.
3319566 3321567 He stinks and I don't like him.
3322319 3323389 Don't move, lady!
3331996 3333109 Guy with eight hands.
3333638 3334747 Sounds hot.
3334816 3336942 He has those tights<br />and that tight little...
3336967 3338615 <i>♪ Dresses like a spider, ♪</i>
3338639 3340302 <i>♪ he looks like a bug ♪</i>
3340796 3344326 <i>♪ But we should all<br />just give him one big hug ♪</i>

3353017 3354589 Who is Spider-Man?
3354613 3356311 He's a criminal, that's who he is!
3356937 3357801 A vigilante.
3357825 3358969 A public menace.
3358993 3360727 What's he doing on my front page?
3360907 3363202 Mr. Jameson, your wife's on line one.<br />She needs to know if you...
3363227 3364644 Mr. Jameson, there's a page six problem.
3364695 3366344 We have a page one problem. Shut up.
3366475 3368017 Well?<br />He's news.
3368532 3371089 They're really important clients.<br />They can't wait. They're about to.
3371118 3373525 He pulled six people off that subway car.
3373549 3375204 Sure, from a wreck he probably caused.
3375372 3377182 Something goes wrong<br />and this creepy crawler is there.
3377207 3379542 Look at that. He's fleeing the scene!<br />What's that tell ya?
3379710 3382462 He's not fleeing, he's probably<br />going to save somebody else.
3382490 3383772 He's a hero!
3383797 3384953 Then why does he wear a mask?
3385731 3386741 What's he got to hide?
3386800 3389761 She just needs to know if you want<br />the chintz or the chenille in the dining room.
3389786 3390834 Whichever one's cheaper.
3390858 3392489 Mr. Jameson, it's like this.
3392639 3394106 We double-booked page six.
3394141 3396476 See, so both Macy's and Conway's<br />both have three quarters...
3396501 3398466 We sold out four printings.
3399337 3400080 Sold out?
3400105 3401355 Every copy.
3401869 3404441 Tomorrow morning, Spider-Man,<br />page one with a decent picture this time.
3404466 3406208 Move Conway to page 7.<br />There's a problem with page 7...
3406233 3408786 And make it page eight, get him<br />10 percent off. Make it five percent.
3408822 3410239 That can't be done.<br />Get outta here!
3410699 3412751 The problem is,<br />we don't have a decent picture.
3412776 3415630 Eddie's been on it for weeks,<br />we can barely get a glimpse of him.
3416013 3417192 What is he, shy?
3417998 3421582 If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong,<br />we can surely get a picture with this weirdo.
3422059 3423241 Put an ad on the front page.
3423343 3425090 Cash money for a picture of Spider-Man.
3425756 3427037 He doesn't wanna be famous?
3427590 3429217 I'll make him infamous!
3440437 3441160 Hey!
3441688 3442652 Buzz off.
3443816 3445346 MJ, it's me, Peter.
3445370 3446245 Hi!
3446418 3447074 Hey.
3448487 3449655 What are you doing around here?
3449679 3452143 I'm begging for a job.<br />How about you?
3453867 3455315 I'm headed to an audition.
3455339 3456274 An audition?
3456674 3457775 So you're acting now?
3457894 3458728 Yeah.
3459158 3460278 I work steady.
3460752 3462875 In fact, I just got off a job.
3463137 3464304 That's great, MJ!
3464795 3465825 You're doing it!
3466013 3467638 You're living your dream!<br />Hey, glamour girl!
3467716 3469799 Yeah.<br />Your drawer was short $6!
3469967 3471122 Next time that happens,
3471146 3472593 I'mma take it out of your check.
3473679 3475168 Excuse me, Miss Watson?
3475419 3476586 I'm talking to you!
3476610 3477387 Hey!
3477683 3479903 Yes, Enrique! Ok? I get you.
3479928 3481591 Well, it better not happen<br />no more, you hear me?
3481615 3483223 Don't roll your eyes at me.
3491238 3492247 Some dream?
3493824 3495699 It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
3496618 3497690 Don't tell Harry.
3497792 3498902 Don't tell Harry?
3499830 3501361 Aren't you guys living together?
3501706 3503254 We're going out. Didn't he tell you?
3504835 3505879 Yeah. Right.
3506670 3509755 I think he'd hate the idea<br />of my waiting tables.
3509923 3511538 He'd think it was low or something.
3511840 3512872 It's not low.
3513222 3514343 You have a job.
3514678 3515849 You know Harry...
3516732 3519015 doesn't live on a little place<br />I like to call Earth.
3520517 3522357 No, I guess not.
3527441 3528629 Thanks, Pete.
3530444 3531847 We should catch up sometime.
3536473 3538082 Let's get some lunch some evening.
3540370 3541526 Well I...
3541713 3544760 I'll come by and have some of your<br />Moondance coffee some day.
3545083 3546364 And I won't tell Harry.
3546388 3547793 No, don't tell Harry.
3547969 3548659 I won't!
3551381 3552754 I won't tell Harry.
3564436 3566248 Timing's perfect. Hey.
3567105 3568386 Five new contracts.
3568410 3569506 It'll be great.
3572754 3575261 Storming Norman's<br />making his weekly inspection.
3576156 3577917 Spent half of it on the phone.
3578929 3581316 Look, man, I'm glad you're here.<br />I need your help.
3581340 3582724 I'm really lost here.
3584538 3585560 Are you alright?
3587224 3588406 You look like you just got,
3588430 3590271 second place in the science fair.
3590443 3591552 No I...
3593029 3595800 I was late for work<br />and Dr. Connors fired me.
3595897 3596958 You were late again?
3598178 3599000 I don't get it.
3599911 3601224 Wait, where do you go all the time?
3602307 3603137 Around.
3603842 3604778 Peter Parker.
3605769 3607508 Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
3607744 3608483 Who's that?
3608508 3610606 This mystery girl Harry's been dating.<br />Dad.
3611900 3613567 When do I get to meet her?<br />Dad.
3613914 3615866 Well sorry, Harry hasn't mentioned her.
3619908 3621814 Hey Pete, you're probably looking for a...
3622023 3623212 a job now, right?
3623370 3624940 Dad, maybe you can help him out.
3626373 3629530 No I... I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.<br />It's no problem.
3629655 3630811 I'll make a few calls.
3630836 3632367 No, I couldn't accept it, sir.
3632391 3635131 I like to earn what I get.<br />I can find my own work.
3635340 3636270 I respect that.
3637820 3639762 You want to make<br />it on your own steam.
3640512 3641582 That's great.
3642723 3644512 What other skills do you have, Parker?
3645267 3647640 I was thinking of something in photography.
3650355 3651285 Hello.
3653525 3654389 Let's go!
3654694 3655556 Move it!
3656987 3658025 Watch the street!
3674087 3674913 Cheese!
3684389 3685390 They're crap.
3685891 3686504 Crap.
3686929 3688562 Crap. Megacrap.
3689061 3690591 I'll give you $200 for all of them.
3690800 3692256 That seems a little low.
3692439 3693686 Take them somewhere else, then.
3694358 3697037 <i>Sir, your wife says the tile you<br />ordered for the foyer is out of stock.</i>
3697428 3698834 Tell her we'll just put a rug there.
3699071 3699892 Sit down.
3699916 3700733 Give me that.
3702616 3703688 Give you 300.
3703712 3705159 That's the standard freelance fee.

3728767 3731470 You bring me some more shots<br />of that newspaper-selling clown,

3742280 3743625 Hi.<br />Hi.
3743698 3746109 Mr. Jameson told me<br />to give that to you.
3748203 3749734 Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
3749758 3750874 Thank you.
3751873 3753249 I'm Peter Parker.
3755752 3757046 I'm a photographer.
3758713 3759577 Yes.
3759765 3761017 I can see that.
3768974 3770602 As of today,
3770976 3772423 OSCORP lndustries,
3772579 3775111 has surpassed Quest Aerospace
3775230 3778509 as the principal supplier<br />to the United States military.
3779818 3782071 In short, ladies and gentlemen<br />of the board...
3782821 3784143 costs are down,
3784680 3785845 revenues are up,
3786241 3787271 and our stock,
3787532 3788859 has never been higher.
3789244 3790608 Wonderful news Norman.
3790632 3791442 Wonderful.
3791813 3793664 In fact, it's the reason<br />for selling the company.
3794749 3795414 What?
3795536 3798658 Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing<br />in the wake of the bombing.
3799310 3800224 Expanding.
3801339 3803716 They made a tender offer<br />we can't ignore.
3804259 3805426 Why wasn't I told?
3805594 3808042 Last thing they want<br />is a power struggle,
3808381 3809834 with entrenched management.
3810233 3812139 The deal is off if you come with it.
3812434 3815319 The board expects<br />your resignation in 30 days.
3816139 3818099 You can't do this to me.
3821043 3822967 I started this company.
3824529 3826732 You know how much I sacrificed?
3830785 3831600 Max.
3831923 3833251 Please.<br />Norman,
3833633 3835696 the board is unanimous.
3836791 3840055 We're announcing the sale<br />after the World Unity Festival.
3840962 3842008 I'm sorry.
3843465 3844860 You're out, Norman.
3855477 3856601 Am I?
3861191 3864234 <i>Welcome to OSCORP lndustries<br />Unity Day Festival!</i>

3906118 3907653 why didn't you wear the black dress?
3908697 3910770 Just, I wanted to impress my father.
3911180 3912366 He loves black.
3912534 3914899 Well, maybe he'll be impressed<br />no matter what.
3915882 3917154 You think I'm pretty.
3917622 3919030 I think you're beautiful.
3932804 3934001 MJ, would you do me a favor?
3934025 3936267 I... forgot my drink inside.<br />Come on.
3946276 3947640 Hi, Mr. Fargas.
3947664 3948596 Harry.
3949487 3951060 Have you seen my father around?
3952002 3954830 Well, I'm not sure if he's coming today.
3966671 3967702 What is that?
3968085 3969438 Must be new this year.
3974468 3975304 What is that?
3975549 3976632 That's our glider!
3987887 3989346 What the hell was that?
4017681 4019098 Code three! Code three!
4035115 4037499 Oh my God! Harry!<br />MJ!
4043248 4045724 Harry! Help me! Harry!
4052268 4054019 Out, am I?
4058972 4060002 Mary Jane!
4060026 4061003 Harry!
4064185 4065925 Hello, my dear.
4067063 4068258 It's Spider-Man!
4080410 4081440 Come on, move, kid.
4081464 4082369 Billy!
4085874 4087800 Somebody help him!
4088418 4089668 No!
4091463 4092393 Mommy!
4095008 4096122 Hold it right there!
4096146 4097375 I surrender.
4097481 4098332 Boy.
4098357 4099270 Hold it right there!
4106226 4107227 Impressive.
4131377 4132467 Mary Jane!
4132491 4133617 Help!
4133641 4135080 Someone please help me!
4160198 4160867 Hold on!
4162909 4163578 Watch out!
4173044 4174617 We'll meet again,
4174969 4176512 Spider-Man!
4178424 4179536 Hold on, Mary Jane!
4222343 4222998 Well,
4223163 4224577 beats taking the subway.
4225221 4227483 Don't mind us.<br />She just needs to use the elevator.
4228406 4229186 Wait.
4229934 4230874 Who are you?
4231352 4232716 You know who I am.
4232888 4233842 I do?
4234100 4235849 Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
4248494 4249400 Incredible?
4250537 4251891 What do you mean he's incredible?
4253595 4255155 No. Alright, wait.
4255179 4256571 Stay there. I'm gonna come over.
4257879 4259093 No, I'm gonna come o...
4259881 4260953 Alright. Fine.
4260977 4262961 Fine, will you call me in the morning,<br />and, and...
4263509 4265125 we'll go and have breakfast and...
4266224 4267891 I wanna buy you something.
4269223 4271253 Because I want to.<br />It'll make you feel better.
4273478 4273966 Ok.
4274729 4275342 And...
4275991 4277252 what do you mean, incredible?
4279984 4280973 Alright. I'm sorry.
4280997 4281736 Sleep tight.
4282528 4283832 Don't let the bedbugs...
4290036 4291233 She's alright.<br />She's...
4291257 4292778 just a little rattled.
4294441 4297238 Look Pete, I should have<br />told you about us.
4299712 4301495 But you should know<br />I'm crazy about her.
4302507 4304289 It's just you know,<br />you never made a move.
4306636 4307468 You're right.
4309055 4310039 I didn't.
4314497 4316195 I'm gonna get some rest.
4318231 4319945 I'm gonna stay up for a while.
4321567 4322789 What was that thing?
4323903 4324858 I don't know.
4326656 4328819 Whatever it is,<br />somebody has to stop it.
4345925 4347089 Somebody there?
4347844 4349479 <i>Somebody?</i>
4351222 4352268 Who said that?
4353433 4356119 <i>Don't play the innocent with me.</i>
4359230 4361275 <i>You've known all along.</i>
4365903 4367035 Where are you?
4367447 4371121 <i>Follow the cold shiver<br />running down your spine.</i>
4378374 4379386 <i>I'm right here.</i>
4381961 4383151 I don't understand.
4384964 4387933 Did you think it was coincidence?
4388384 4392113 So many good things,<br />all happening for you.
4392189 4393711 All for you,
4394144 4395386 Norman.
4398311 4399308 What do you want?
4400271 4402183 To say what you won't.
4402607 4404709 To do what you can't.
4405318 4406724 To remove...
4407013 4409084 those in your way.
4413868 4415067 The board members.
4417524 4418461 You killed them.
4418664 4420063 We killed them.
4420625 4421430 We?
4421793 4422832 Remember?
4423503 4426171 Your little accident in the laboratory.
4428174 4429800 The performance enhancers.
4429967 4430873 Bingo.
4430897 4431707 Me!
4432525 4434580 Your greatest creation.
4435515 4438805 Bringing you what you've always wanted.
4439477 4442477 Power, beyond your wildest dreams.
4442502 4444446 And it's only the beginning.
4446526 4448056 There's only one...
4448971 4450455 who can stop us.
4451656 4454557 Or imagine if he joined us.
4459956 4460986 Spider-Man.
4461570 4463041 And the Green Goblin.
4463209 4464698 The Green Goblin. You like that?
4464722 4466162 Made it up myself.<br />Mr. Jameson.
4466477 4468326 These weirdos all gotta have a name now.
4468351 4469701 Mr. Jameson, Spider-Ma...
4469726 4470630 Hoffman!<br />Yeah?
4472822 4474792 Call the patent office,<br />copyright the name Green Goblin,
4474816 4476533 I want a quarter every<br />time somebody says it.
4476639 4478025 How about Green Meanie?
4478847 4480798 Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.
4480822 4482203 He was trying to save it. That's slander.
4482228 4484080 It is not. I resent that.
4484564 4485803 Slander is spoken.
4485975 4487108 In print, it's libel.
4487775 4489631 You don't trust anybody, that's your problem.
4489861 4491061 I trust my barber.
4492480 4494106 What are you, his lawyer?<br />Get outta here.
4494157 4496283 Let him sue me,<br />get rich like a normal person.
4496450 4497691 That's what made this country...
4506419 4507449 Jameson,
4507473 4509030 you slime.
4509544 4513121 Who's the photographer<br />who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?
4513259 4515359 I don't know who he is.<br />His stuff comes in the mail.
4515384 4517179 You're lying!<br />I swear.
4517291 4519648 He's the one who can bring me to him.
4519673 4520921 I don't know who he is.
4520945 4522579 You are useless.
4522604 4524329 Set him down tough guy.
4525146 4526572 Speak of the devil!
4526596 4528887 Spider-Man, I knew you two<br />were in this together!
4528911 4529548 I...
4529767 4532556 Hey kiddo, let Mom and Dad<br />talk for a minute, will you?
4532581 4535041 Sleep...
4549670 4551410 <i>Wake up little spider.</i>
4552154 4553060 <i>Wake up.</i>
4553841 4554788 <i>No,</i>
4555176 4556707 <i>you're not dead...</i>
4557043 4557988 <i>yet.</i>
4558471 4560441 <i>Just paralyzed...</i>
4560806 4562191 <i>temporarily.</i>
4563768 4566518 You're an amazing creature, Spider-Man.
4567243 4569816 You and I are not so different.
4570370 4571513 I'm not like you.
4572439 4573706 You're a murderer.
4573986 4574641 Well,
4575323 4576526 to each his own.
4577031 4578562 I chose my path,
4578586 4580156 you chose the way of the hero.
4580660 4583066 And they found you amusing<br />for a while,
4583398 4584976 the people of this city.
4585498 4588490 But the one thing they love<br />more than a hero...
4588960 4590699 is to see a hero fail,
4590723 4591533 fall,
4591557 4592545 die trying.
4593037 4595412 In spite of everything you've done for<br />them,
4595436 4597079 eventually, they will hate you.
4597385 4598385 Why bother?
4599125 4600626 Because it's right.
4601054 4602789 Here's the real truth.
4603849 4606476 There are eight million people in this city.
4607187 4611356 And those teeming masses<br />exist for the sole purpose
4611718 4615527 of lifting the few exceptional<br />people onto their shoulders.
4616023 4616960 You, me,
4617587 4618986 we're exceptional.
4619865 4624536 I could squash you<br />like a bug right now.
4624745 4626652 But I'm offering you a choice.
4627559 4628556 Join me.
4628582 4631971 Imagine what we could<br />accomplish together.
4632378 4634479 What we could create.
4635715 4637347 Or we could destroy.
4638004 4641312 Because the deaths of countless<br />innocents in selfish
4641336 4644175 battle again and again and<br />again until we're both dead.
4644748 4646560 Is that what you want?
4648936 4650834 Think about it, hero.
4663784 4666358 <i>In spite of everything<br />you've done for them,</i>
4666382 4668420 <i>eventually they will hate you.</i>
4678257 4679013 Hey!
4679425 4680330 It's me again.
4680354 4681120 Hey!
4681302 4682464 How was your audition?
4682928 4683959 How'd you know?
4683983 4685526 The hot line. Your mom
4686098 4687635 told my aunt, told me.
4688517 4689936 So you just came by?
4690061 4691508 I was in the neighborhood.
4691532 4693217 Needed to see a friendly face.
4693856 4697567 I took two buses and a cab<br />to get in the neighborhood, but...
4698694 4699762 So how'd it go?
4702365 4704487 They said I needed acting lessons.
4705061 4707288 A soap opera told me<br />I needed acting lessons.
4709038 4710569 Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
4711070 4713113 The sky's the limit, up to $7
4713668 4714907 84 cents.
4715711 4717288 I'd like a cheeseburger.
4718577 4720662 But, I'm going out to dinner with Harry.
4722134 4723061 Come with us.
4723719 4724666 No, thanks.
4725459 4726635 How's it going with...
4728391 4729240 Never mind.
4729265 4730837 That's none of my business.
4731394 4732341 It's not?
4734313 4735532 Why so interested?
4736649 4737524 I'm not.
4738401 4739290 You're not?
4741404 4742893 Well, why would I be?
4743055 4743993 I don't know.
4744337 4745594 Why would you be?
4748077 4749162 I, that's a...
4750409 4751592 I don't know.
4754592 4756037 Sorry you won't come with us.
4759778 4761037 I better run, tiger.
4770080 4771220 Hey, check it out, man.
4772460 4773236 Come on, man.
4777690 4779634 Hey, where you going, baby?<br />Come on!
4798695 4799734 Get off me!
4833407 4834180 Wait!
4839919 4841958 You have a knack<br />for getting in trouble.
4842463 4844411 You have a knack for saving my life.
4845051 4846950 I think I have a superhero stalker.
4847051 4848730 I was in the neighborhood.
4850804 4851626 You are...
4852087 4853054 amazing.
4854391 4855827 Some people don't think so.
4858187 4859134 But you are.
4859743 4861189 Nice to have a fan.
4861941 4863908 Do I get to say thank you this time?
4866028 4866783 Wait.
4936210 4938171 I have to get in there! My baby's in there!
4938196 4939506 My baby's in there! Let me go!
4939530 4941130 I can't let you in there,<br />the roof's about to collapse!
4941155 4942801 Please save my baby!<br />I can't let you in there,
4942825 4944530 Somebody save my baby!<br />The roof's about to collapse!
4944815 4946149 Look! Up there!
4952823 4954616 Save my baby, please!
4978307 4979246 No!
4987191 4988555 It's ok. Your baby's fine.
4989034 4990245 My baby!
4992237 4993852 God bless you, Spider-Man.
4994323 4995276 Bless you.
4995301 4997116 There he's! Don't let him get away!
4997326 4998732 Hold it! Hold it right there!
4999011 5000644 You're under arrest. I'm taking you in.
5000691 5002840 My God, there's<br />somebody still up there!
5005250 5006250 I'm going.
5008545 5010118 I'll be here when you get back.
5010142 5011589 Not coming back, chief.
5012007 5013132 Go! Go!
5022059 5023090 Where are you?
5025777 5027082 Where are you?
5032778 5034067 I'm gonna get you out of here!
5037741 5038637 It's ok.
5046291 5048487 You're pathetically predictable.
5049129 5050730 Like a moth to the flame.
5051839 5054298 What about my generous proposal?
5055342 5056498 Are you in
5056522 5057831 or are you out?
5058387 5059959 It's you who's out, Gobby.
5060251 5061240 Out of your mind.
5061468 5062772 Wrong answer.
5064727 5065531 Great.
5104892 5107091 No one says no to me!
5115027 5116975 MJ, will you stop goofing around?
5116999 5118446 Harry, relax.
5121159 5122200 He's here.
5122993 5123940 Are you ready?
5124344 5125118 Yeah.
5126064 5127402 Aunt May.
5127535 5128841 I'm sorry I'm late.
5129208 5130321 Work was murder.
5130993 5132478 I picked up a fruitcake.
5132503 5133677 Why thank you Mr. Osborn.
5133702 5134982 We're so glad you could come.<br />You look great.
5135007 5135600 Thanks.
5136173 5138124 Who is this lovely young lady?
5139051 5141249 MJ, I'd like you to meet<br />my father, Norman Osborn.
5141273 5142976 Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.
5143001 5144335 Hi.<br />How do you do?
5144359 5146280 I've been looking forward to meeting you.
5146433 5147797 Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
5147821 5150144 Now, where is Peter?
5150523 5152731 He'd better have remembered<br />that cranberry sauce.
5158408 5159184 That's...
5159377 5160838 weird, I didn't know he was here.
5165035 5165886 Peter?
5171269 5172215 Peter?
5174586 5175674 Is that you?
5179729 5180432 Pete?
5181760 5183124 How strange.
5183149 5184580 There's nobody here.
5192396 5193885 Bit of a slob, isn't he?
5193971 5196103 All brilliant men are.
5229614 5230630 Hey, everyone.
5231341 5232132 Peter!
5232157 5234105 Peter!<br />Sorry I'm late, it's a jungle out there.
5234130 5236796 Had to beat an old lady with<br />a stick to get these cranberries.
5238567 5239597 Thank you.
5239621 5241402 Now then, everybody sit down
5241640 5243224 and we can say grace.
5244630 5245488 Parker.
5246700 5248451 Here we go.
5255417 5256531 There we are.
5256555 5258120 It looks delicious.
5258253 5259245 Norman.
5261548 5262971 Will you do the honors?
5275520 5276801 Why Peter,
5276910 5278501 you're bleeding.
5281493 5282360 Yeah.
5282714 5284600 I stepped off a kerb and...
5285042 5286948 got clipped<br />by one of those bike messengers.
5287084 5288495 Well, let me see.
5288867 5290451 Oh my goodness.
5290619 5292937 That looks awful.<br />No, it's nothing.
5293205 5294819 I'll get the first-aid kit.
5294913 5296516 Then we'll say grace.
5296541 5299324 This is the boys' first Thanksgiving<br />in this apartment
5299348 5301873 and we<br />are going to do things properly.
5302798 5304836 How did you say that happened?
5306301 5307394 Bike messenger.
5308220 5309433 Knocked me down.
5315560 5317258 If you'll excuse me I've...
5317461 5319310 got to be going.<br />Wh... Why?
5320148 5321262 Something...
5321663 5323374 has come to my attention.
5323735 5324702 Are you alright?
5325116 5326601 I'm fine, just fine.
5326625 5328960 Thank you, Mrs. Parker.<br />Everyone.
5329324 5330396 Enjoy the fruitcake.
5330576 5331398 Dad!
5333031 5333828 Dad!
5334148 5335117 What are you doing?
5335429 5337967 I plan this whole thing so you can<br />meet MJ and now you have to leave?
5337992 5338999 I've got to go.
5340040 5341532 This girl is important to me.
5341556 5343953 Harry, please. Look at her.
5344315 5348180 Do you think a woman like that's sniffing<br />around because she likes your personality?
5348427 5349374 What are you saying?
5349925 5351467 Your mother was beautiful too.
5351492 5352659 They're all beautiful.
5352931 5357018 Until they're snarling after your trust<br />fund like a pack of ravening wolves.
5357227 5358519 You're wrong about her, Dad.
5359021 5362189 A word to the not-so-wise<br />about your little girlfriend.
5362399 5365067 Do what you need to with her,<br />then broom her fast.
5376705 5378470 Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.
5379416 5380238 You heard?
5380955 5382187 Everyone heard that creep.
5382273 5383991 That creep is my father.
5384015 5386436 Alright, If I'm lucky, I'll<br />become half of what he is.
5386715 5389155 So just keep your mouth shut<br />about stuff you don't understand!
5389180 5391069 Harry Osborn!
5391719 5393000 I'm sorry, Aunt May.
5396811 5400147 <i>Spider-Man is all but invincible.</i>
5400479 5401717 <i>But Parker,</i>
5402390 5403969 <i>we can destroy him.</i>
5404256 5405193 I can't.
5405317 5408145 <i>Betrayal must not be countenanced.</i>
5408570 5409350 <i>Parker...</i>
5409374 5410821 <i>must be educated.</i>
5413629 5414468 What do I do?
5414493 5418300 <i>Instruct him in the matters<br />of loss and pain.</i>
5418747 5419986 <i>Make him suffer.</i>
5420081 5422073 <i>Make him wish he were dead.</i>
5422480 5423334 Yes?
5423502 5425419 <i>And then grant his wish.</i>
5426659 5427630 But how?
5427839 5432134 <i>The cunning warrior attacks<br />neither body nor mind.</i>
5432344 5433511 Tell me how!
5433678 5435846 <i>The heart, Osborn.</i>
5436098 5439141 <i>First, we attack his heart.</i>
5441019 5444629 Give us this day our daily bread,<br />and forgive us our trespasses
5444902 5447715 as we forgive those who<br />trespassed against us.
5447984 5451012 Lead us not into temptation,<br />but deliver us...
5459709 5462252 Deliver us!
5462438 5463623 Finish it!
5463959 5464989 Finish it!
5465014 5467389 From evil!
5477556 5478806 Get the BP.
5479145 5479962 Aunt May!
5480309 5481380 Is she gonna be ok?
5481404 5482980 What happened? What happened?<br />Yes, she's going to be ok.
5483269 5484315 Look, you're going to have to leave.
5484340 5485218 Right now.<br />What happened?
5485335 5486507 Those eyes!
5486587 5489050 Those horrible yellow eyes!
5495323 5496682 He knows who I am.
5541828 5542828 I'm sorry.
5547125 5548304 Will she be ok?
5548329 5549671 She's gonna be fine.
5549696 5551351 She's been sleeping all day.
5553423 5554495 Thanks for coming.
5555089 5556118 Of course.
5560347 5561252 How are you?
5561641 5563382 You ok about the other night?
5563407 5564380 Yeah, I'm fine. I...
5565125 5567076 I just felt bad<br />about leaving Aunt May.
5567354 5568467 Have you talked to Harry?
5568820 5569726 He called me.
5570961 5572316 I haven't called him back.
5575028 5576155 The fact is...
5578296 5579729 I'm in love with somebody else.
5580046 5580741 You are?
5580846 5582139 At least, I think I am.
5584788 5586803 It's not the right time to talk about it.<br />No, no.
5586828 5587691 Go on.
5587999 5590225 Would I know his name, this guy?
5591764 5593818 You'll think I'm a stupid<br />little girl with a crush.
5594506 5595529 Trust me.
5596132 5597209 It's funny.
5599386 5601250 He's saved my life twice,
5601274 5603009 and I've never even seen his face.
5604236 5604962 Him.
5605783 5606892 You're laughing at me.<br />No. No.
5606917 5608257 No, I understand.
5608767 5610204 He is extremely cool.
5610229 5613150 But do you think it's true, all the<br />terrible things they say about him?
5613175 5614138 No, no.
5614162 5617095 Not Spider-Man,<br />not a chance in the world.
5617862 5619086 I know him a little bit.
5619698 5622094 I'm sort of his<br />unofficial photographer.
5622784 5624357 Has he mentioned me?
5625143 5625896 Yeah.
5626246 5627327 What'd he say?
5628360 5629319 I said...
5630709 5632238 He asked me...
5633287 5634615 what I thought about you.
5636248 5637396 And what did you say?
5638675 5639664 I said...
5642131 5644126 Spider-Man. I said...
5645530 5647514 The great thing about MJ...
5648340 5649202 Is...
5650645 5651509 When you...
5652017 5653301 look in her eyes,
5656443 5658371 and she's looking back in yours,
5660655 5661811 everything...
5662280 5663240 feels...
5664868 5666201 Not quite normal.
5667954 5669172 Because you feel...
5670290 5671422 stronger...
5673460 5674490 and weaker...
5675219 5676531 at the same time.
5678154 5679586 You feel excited...
5681251 5682656 and at the same time...
5683803 5684913 Terrified.
5687766 5689338 The truth is you...
5689846 5691889 you don't know what you feel,
5693480 5696077 except you know what<br />kind of man you want to be.
5699819 5701249 It's as if you've...
5702322 5703060 reached...
5703678 5705092 the unreachable...
5707077 5708701 and you weren't ready for it.
5713249 5714420 You said that?
5715794 5717663 Well, something like that.
5748294 5749128 Hey.
5762424 5763424 Dad?
5769264 5770720 Dad, is that you?
5777939 5778878 What is it?
5781865 5783265 Well, you were right about MJ.
5784130 5785622 You're right about everything.
5787839 5789216 She's in love with Peter.
5790702 5791607 Parker?
5792123 5792564 Yeah.
5792834 5794467 And how does he feel about her?
5797208 5799411 He's loved her since the 4th grade.
5800712 5802368 He pretends like he doesn't, but...
5802766 5804609 there's no one Peter cares for more.
5808887 5809977 I'm so sorry.
5813099 5815285 I haven't always been there for you, have I?
5818313 5820678 You're busy.<br />You're an important man. I...
5820702 5821523 I understand.
5821733 5823172 That's no excuse.
5824448 5825820 I'm proud of you.
5826863 5830373 I've lost sight of that somewhere.<br />But I'm gonna make it up to you, Harry.
5831910 5835303 I'm going to rectify certain inequities.
5849302 5850982 Wake up, little spider.
5851191 5852232 Wake up.
5854098 5855474 Go home, dear.
5855806 5857140 You look awful.
5857435 5859728 And you look beautiful.<br />Well, thank you.
5859938 5861313 I don't like to leave you here.
5861338 5862813 But I'm safe here.
5863399 5864763 Can I do anything for you?
5864787 5866109 You do too much.
5866277 5867433 College, a job,
5867648 5870485 all this time with me.<br />You're not Superman, you know.
5872575 5874298 A smile. Finally.
5874353 5877696 Haven't seen one of those on your<br />face since Mary Jane was here.
5877765 5878402 Hey.
5878816 5880827 You were supposed to be asleep.
5881983 5886334 You know, you were about 6 years old<br />when MJ's family moved in next door.
5887090 5888662 And when she got out of the car,
5888816 5891051 and you saw her for the first time,
5891219 5893834 you grabbed me and said,<br />Aunt May,
5893858 5895044 Aunt May,
5895714 5897370 is that an angel?
5897767 5898964 Gee, did I say that?
5899409 5900839 You sure did.
5903943 5904397 Well,
5904901 5906214 Harry's in love with her.
5906943 5908349 She's still his girl.
5908856 5910466 Well, isn't that up to her?
5910905 5912811 She doesn't really know who I am.
5913450 5915122 Because you won't let her.
5915702 5918130 You're so mysterious all the time.
5919080 5919818 Tell me,
5920286 5921980 would it be so dangerous
5922005 5925271 to let Mary Jane know<br />how much you care?
5926421 5928922 Everybody else knows.
5931968 5933218 I'll be right back.
5933886 5934770 But...
5942520 5943958 Come on, pick up.
5944572 5945572 <i>Hi...</i><br />Hey MJ!
5945597 5946947 Sing your song at the beep.
5949027 5950471 MJ, it's Peter. You there?
5951213 5951934 Hello?
5952471 5953338 You there?
5954699 5956583 Well, I'm just calling<br />to check up on you.
5956607 5958353 Will you call me when you get in, ok?
5959252 5960228 Alright, well...
5960955 5961774 Don't...
5962947 5964485 Don't go up any dark alleys.
5965460 5966032 Hello?
5969741 5972381 Can Spider-Man come out to play?
5973301 5974504 Where is she?
6021439 6023106 What is that?<br />That's cool!

6048960 6050669 Goblin, what have you done?
6092975 6094034 Spider-Man!
6094261 6097105 This is why only fools are heroes.
6097425 6099135 Because you never know,
6099218 6103315 when some lunatic will come<br />along with a sadistic choice.
6105099 6107588 Let die the woman you love?
6112064 6113053 Or...
6114232 6116814 Suffer the little children.
6119420 6120227 Spider-Man!
6120251 6121498 Save us!
6122533 6124030 Save us!
6125036 6127621 Make your choice, Spider-Man.
6127830 6131091 And see how a hero is rewarded.
6131304 6132560 Don't do it, Goblin!
6133628 6136023 We are who we choose to be.
6136564 6137899 Now, choose!
6137924 6138978 No!
6168246 6169610 Everybody stay still!
6179340 6180508 Ahoy up there!
6180912 6183830 We're gonna bring<br />the barge right under you.
6191487 6192424 He's coming back!
6192862 6193550 Listen.
6194049 6195397 I need you to climb down.
6195422 6196261 I can't.
6196285 6197236 Yes, you can!
6202154 6203685 MJ, you can do it.
6203888 6204841 You have to!
6205248 6206177 Trust me.
6208452 6209566 Hold on tight
6210170 6211155 and go quickly.
6216627 6217366 Hurry!
6217884 6218979 I can't. I can't do it!
6219004 6220377 Hang on, Mary Jane!
6248993 6251141 He's not gonna make it.<br />He's gonna make it!
6261505 6263366 It's time to die.
6271724 6274542 Come on up here, tough guy!<br />I got a little something for ya!
6274567 6275814 We ought to kick your freaking ass!
6275839 6277050 Leave Spider-Man alone!
6277074 6279216 You gonna pick on a guy trying<br />to save a bunch of kids?
6279815 6281560 Yeah, I got something for your ass!
6281585 6283461 You mess with Spidey,<br />you mess with New York!
6283486 6285946 You mess with one of us,<br />you mess with all of us!
6299543 6300993 Spider-Man, watch out!
6333202 6335531 Misery, misery, misery.
6335556 6337164 That's what you've chosen.
6338374 6340179 I offered you friendship,
6341066 6342942 and you spat in my face.
6394138 6397263 You've spun your last web, Spider-Man.
6397975 6401620 Had you not been so selfish,<br />your little girlfriend's death
6401645 6403188 would have been quick and painless.
6403213 6406230 But now that<br />you've really pissed me off,
6406984 6408723 I'm gonna finish her,
6409176 6412046 nice and slow.
6416452 6418029 MJ and I...
6419330 6422428 We're gonna have a hell of a time.
6476341 6477631 Peter, stop!
6478139 6478877 Stop!
6479181 6480279 It's me.
6489567 6490739 Mr. Osborn.
6491091 6492513 Peter, thank God for you.
6493310 6495280 You killed those people<br />on that balcony.
6495372 6497755 The Goblin killed!<br />I had nothing to do with it!
6498130 6500239 Don't, don't let him take me again.
6500619 6502662 I beg you. Protect me.
6502830 6504972 You tried to kill Aunt May.
6504997 6506374 You tried to kill Mary Jane.
6506584 6507631 But not you.
6508752 6510283 I tried to stop it,
6510748 6512522 but I couldn't stop it.
6512923 6514412 I would never hurt you.
6515217 6516654 I knew from the beginning...
6517344 6519568 If anything ever happened to me...
6519938 6522248 It was you that I could count on.
6522766 6526102 You, Peter Parker,<br />would save me and so you have.
6526687 6527934 Thank God for you.
6529523 6530700 Give me your hand.
6532109 6533181 Believe in me...
6533564 6535187 as I believed in you.
6536649 6538491 I've been like a father to you.
6541285 6542952 Be a son to me now.
6544747 6546068 I have a father.
6547374 6549334 His name was Ben Parker.
6551754 6553754 Godspeed Spider-Man.<br />What?
6572149 6573064 Peter...
6575986 6577278 Don't tell Harry.
6609520 6610625 What have you done?
6611397 6612574 What have you done?
6636255 6637080 Hey.
6641135 6642462 I'm so sorry, Harry.
6644096 6646048 I know what it's like to lose a father.
6649393 6650590 I didn't lose him.
6650614 6652103 He was stolen from me.
6654273 6655923 One day, Spider-Man will pay.
6658444 6660852 I swear on my father's grave,<br />Spider-Man will pay.
6666577 6668126 Thank God for you, Peter.
6669121 6670642 You're the only family I have.

6716835 6718726 You must miss him so much.
6720130 6722163 It's been so hard without him.
6726095 6728148 There's something<br />I've been wanting to tell you.
6730695 6732024 When I was up there,
6733380 6734900 and I thought I was gonna die...
6737731 6740173 There was only one person<br />who I was thinking of.
6742861 6745134 And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.
6747477 6748852 It was you Pete.
6750828 6752094 I kept thinking,
6753372 6755329 I hope I make it through this,
6757376 6760510 so I could see Peter Parker's<br />face one more time.
6763132 6764041 Really?
6765008 6766539 There's only one man,
6767531 6769640 who's always been there for me...
6772057 6773539 Who makes me feel...
6774476 6776936 like I'm more than I ever<br />thought I could be.
6780315 6781507 That I'm just...
6782651 6783611 Me.
6785237 6786338 And that's ok.
6789121 6790111 The truth is,
6792953 6793892 I love you.
6796832 6798431 I love you so much, Peter.

6820964 6823253 <font color="#80ffff"><i>was to tell<br />her how much I loved her...</i></font>
6824443 6825440 I can't.
6828489 6829556 You can't what?
6831158 6832204 Tell you...
6834328 6835858 Everything. I mean...
6836907 6838581 there's so much to tell.
6839750 6840738 Yeah.
6841611 6843345 There's so much to tell.
6844478 6845821 I want you to know...
6846965 6849344 that I will always be there for you.
6849999 6852782 I will always be there<br />to take care of you.
6854806 6856274 I promise you that.
6860103 6862000 I will always be your friend.
6865317 6866633 Only a friend...
6868070 6869156 Peter Parker?
6871782 6873523 That's all I have to give.
