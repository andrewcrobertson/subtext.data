8009 11095 Hello, this is J.K. Simmons.
11262 13890 Actually, this is J.K. Simmons<br />and that is Tobey Maguire.
14056 15766 Tobey Maguire.
15933 20188 Gonna watch Spider-Man<br />and talk to you guys.
20354 23983 Yeah. And that was<br />the Columbia lady shedding light.
24609 26402 Very cool logo.
26569 30281 Marvel Comics. I thought it was<br />part of the movie when I first saw it.
30448 33075 It's just the Marvel logo.
40291 42668 And very cool Danny Elf man...
42835 44128 - Score.<br />- ...theme here, yeah.
44295 45755 Yeah.
51093 52803 I remember sitting at the premier...
52970 56807 ...really remember<br />just right off the bat just being...
56974 58851 ...sucked right in.
59018 61395 Oh, yeah. It was so exciting too.
61562 64857 The energy and anticipation<br />of the film was just insane.
65024 66067 - Yeah.<br />- It was...
66234 68778 I was like on the edge<br />of my seat and...
68945 73157 ...I couldn't wait to see<br />how people responded.
88506 90925 - "J.K. Simmons."<br />- Hey, I heard of him.
91092 92426 Yeah.
92593 95054 I've worked with him before actually.
95221 97390 - Right, there's a little trivia fact.<br />- Sure.
97556 99850 <i>Cider House Rules.</i>
101018 104522 - Played Charlize's pops, right?<br />- Yeah.
104689 105940 I can't remember his name.
106107 107942 - The lobster man. Ray.<br />- Right.
108109 110403 Ray, the lobster man.
122790 126711 I gotta say, I had a great time<br />on this film...
127003 129338 ...and it comes from Sam.<br />Sam Raimi.
129505 131048 Absolutely. Yeah.
131215 132591 He was...
132758 134927 It was hard for me<br />to get this job actually.
135094 139181 The studio was hesitant<br />to hire me...
139348 142601 ...as this is a huge investment<br />for them...
142768 146022 ...and, you know, I guess people<br />are used to seeing me...
146188 147898 ...in art-house films...
148065 152778 ...playing more passive,<br />less heroic characters...
152945 155906 ...very introspective, and...
157241 158451 They didn't...
158617 160536 They said,<br />"Well, we like him as an actor.
160703 162872 We're not sure if he's right<br />for this role."
163039 165833 And Sam Raimi really fought for me.
166000 168461 And it was hard.<br />I had to fight with him...
168627 171464 ...but he was so supportive<br />and so passionate...
171630 173549 ...about having me in the movie.
173716 178179 You know, I went through<br />two screen tests...
178346 180056 ...for the film.
181599 184477 And then off to the races...
184643 187938 ...but it was good<br />because I really felt...
188105 189357 ...like a partner with Sam.
189523 192109 - Yeah.<br />- So it was a good way to go into it.
192276 196113 And then just having a ball with Sam<br />making the movie.
196280 198074 He's so much fun, so funny.
198240 200409 Yeah, yeah, he's great. He's...
200576 203788 I described him once as being like...
203954 206791 ...a really, really smart 9-year-old boy.
206957 210211 Because he's got a lot of<br />that kind of fun about him.
210378 213964 Fun, silly energy, but very smart<br />and very collaborative.
214131 215132 Yeah.
215299 217635 There's Kirsten Dunst,<br />who I flew out to Germany...
217802 219470 ...when I had strep throat.
219637 221722 We had read tons of girls<br />and we were like...
221889 224058 ...four weeks before<br />we started shooting.
224225 226519 And, you know,<br />that's a short amount of time...
226685 229230 ...for this kind of film,<br />where they have all these...
229397 232316 I mean, she didn't have<br />a superhero costume...
232483 234527 ...but, you know,<br />they need preparation time.
234693 235820 Right.
235986 238697 And I didn't wanna go.
238864 241075 And I said to Sam...
241242 243494 Didn't wanna spend eight hours<br />on a plane with strep?
243661 246205 Yeah, I didn't. Well, actually<br />I had to go to New York.
246372 248624 <i>From LA. To New York...</i>
249083 252628 No, L.A. to Germany for...
253087 255714 ...17 hours, be in Germany, Berlin...
255881 257633 ...then go to New York<br />for two days...
257800 259969 ...and come home.<br />And I called my doctor...
260136 264682 ...and said, "Can you give me a note<br />so I can call Sam...
264849 268102 ...or give the note that I can't go<br />to Sam?" And I called...
268269 270312 "Dear Mr. Raimi, Tobey is too sick..."
270479 274942 And I called Sam and I said, you know,<br />"My doctor doesn't think I should go."
275693 278320 Sam said, "Tobey...
278487 280990 ...I've gotta tell my kids that...
281157 283117 ...Daddy can't be with them<br />this weekend...
283284 287204 ...and I really don't wanna do that.<br />This is about sacrifice.
287371 290708 And pack your bags<br />because you're coming to Germany."
290875 294879 So off we went,<br />and thank God, because that was it.
295045 297506 I mean, I'm not gonna say,<br />you know...
297882 300551 We basically all knew<br />right as it was happening...
300718 302386 - Yeah, yeah.<br />- ...that she was it.
302553 304388 She was so...
305598 309977 There were a lot of wonderful names<br />and ideas that came up for casting...
310144 314064 ...but then, yeah, when I met Kirsten<br />and saw her doing it, there's just...
314231 316609 Nobody could have been any better.
316775 318360 For the role, yeah, exactly.
318527 321405 ...Public-school kids.<br />I'm not showing up in the Rolls.
321572 323908 What, you want me<br />to trade in my car for a Jetta...
324074 326494 ...because you flunked out<br />of every private school...
326660 328204 And these guys...
328746 331832 Willem and James Franco.
332666 334710 One of the great things<br />that you notice...
334877 336712 ...in the very first scene is that...
336879 339423 ...you see actors playing<br />father and son all the time...
339590 341675 ...that there's no way<br />they could be related.
341842 343427 And these guys, you know...
343594 346055 ...not only are they both<br />good actors...
346222 347389 ...but they actually...
347556 349266 - Look like...<br />- They could be related.
349433 350434 Exactly.
351560 353354 Good job.
353896 357107 There I am, looking like a nerd.
357900 358943 It's perfect.
359276 361320 So was that a big stretch,<br />the nerd thing?
361487 365616 Well, it is a big stretch,<br />but people don't realize that.
365783 368118 Only my friends realize that.
368869 372122 Impressive.<br />Your parents must be very proud.
372289 374124 I live with my aunt and uncle.<br />They are.
374291 376293 It was great working with Willem.<br />I like...
376460 379797 I think I threw <i>in the DVD<br />of Last Temptation of Christ...</i>
379964 382341 ...the night before I started<br />working with him.
382508 385886 You know, I said, "I'm going to work<br />with Jesus Christ tomorrow."
386053 387429 Right.
389557 391517 He had just gotten done...<br />The vampire...
391684 394311 - What <i>was the vampire movie?<br />- Shadow of the Vampire.</i>
394478 397690 That was just out when we...<br />When I started working with him.
397856 399149 Yup.
399316 401944 This is the most advanced electron<br />microscope...
402152 404738 Peter Parker,<br />impressed with things...
404905 407241 ...that most teenagers<br />couldn't care less about.
407408 409243 That's what most teenagers<br />care about.
409410 410911 Yeah, exactly.
412037 417501 For example, the Delena spider,<br />family Sparassidae, has the ability...
418168 420838 This is very typical...
422089 424842 ...you know, sweet, smart,<br />underdog character...
425009 426719 ...and getting picked on here.
426885 428679 - Right. And big, mean Joe.<br />- Right.
428846 430764 Flash Thompson.
431265 434018 That's the other thing about this,<br />I had such a good time...
434184 435978 ...because everybody in the film...
436145 439481 ...like these guys, were great<br />and they were a lot of fun.
439648 443068 And I just say, that all comes<br />from Sam again, in my opinion.
443235 444320 Yeah. Yeah.
444486 447281 I was gonna say... This is<br />the Sam Raimi butt-kissing hour...
447448 448532 ...but it's really true.
448699 451577 You know, he does<br />a great job of hiring...
451744 455039 ...not only people who are gonna be<br />really good at their job...
455205 459043 ...but people that, you know,<br />you can spend a few months with...
459209 461837 ...and really collaborate with<br />and have a good time with.
462004 466216 The whole process before we started<br />shooting, for a couple months...
466383 469470 I mean, I trained physically<br />for four or five months...
469637 472139 ...but the whole process<br />of getting in a room...
472306 475142 ...with the different actors<br />and Sam...
475309 478729 And we would go through,<br />scene by scene...
478896 481940 ...and break down the scenes<br />and what they meant...
482107 485736 ...for our characters,<br />and what place they had in the film...
485903 488155 ...and in our characters' arcs...
488322 491533 ...was a great process because<br />it gets us all on the same page...
491700 495079 ...and we're all going in to make<br />the same movie with the same tone.
495245 498123 And we all felt like...
498290 501210 ...we were partners<br />in making the film.
501377 505756 We were filmmakers and not just<br />hired puppets to come in and...
505923 508550 - Come in and say the lines. Yeah.<br />- Right.
508717 511762 So that's always nice<br />because I can see my...
511929 514973 You know, my handprint<br />on the movie here and there...
515140 518811 ...beyond just my performance,<br />which is a lot of fun.
519144 520771 Yeah, it was really a very...
520938 524942 Especially considering the big-budget,<br />blockbuster nature of it...
525109 530114 ...it was a very collaborative,<br />supportive, fun kind of project.
530280 532700 ...Genetically designed super-spiders.
532950 534451 There's 14.
534910 536286 I beg your pardon?
536453 538997 - One's missing.<br />- Yeah.
541917 544545 I guess the researchers<br />are working on that one.
545921 548674 There's James snaking my girl.
549967 554012 You were talking throughout<br />that woman's entire presentation.
554179 555931 Let's go talk about how we listen.
561437 562646 - Come on, go for it.<br />- Yeah.
564940 566692 Getting the nerve.
566859 569445 I think that's a moment<br />that we can all identify with...
569611 571989 - ...from adolescent days or beyond.<br />- Absolutely.
572156 575659 Well, I do wanna say that<br />this is acting for me at this point.
578579 580164 - Sure.<br />- Great.
580330 582541 Where do you want me? Over here?
582750 584084 Yeah, that's great.
584501 586170 Don't make me look ugly.
586336 588714 She's great. She's just so natural.
588881 593510 So believable and solid,<br />but fun and funny.
593761 596847 Something I love is,<br />she doesn't work with vanity...
597014 599600 ...and she's not...<br />She doesn't really care, you know.
599767 602478 She's not, like, cautious or vain...
602644 606148 ...or looking at herself, self-conscious.<br />She just goes for it and...
606315 608650 ...is there<br />to have a good time and...
610611 611612 Oh, here's the one.
611779 615115 Here's the little guy<br />that sets the whole mess in motion.
615282 617201 What is in this thing?
617367 619161 What is in that little guy?
619953 621872 By the way, that wasn't my hand.
622039 623373 That was not my thumbnail.
623540 626210 And I know I'm blowing<br />the magic of movies there...
626376 628629 ...but that was not my thumbnail.
631340 633300 So a hand model got a day at work?
633467 634885 I don't know who that was.
635052 637888 - That was probably Sam. Yeah.<br />- Sam Raimi.
638055 639139 Now see that thumbnail?
639306 641642 - Oh, that's not...?<br />- That's mine.
641809 643894 How strange.
652110 653278 "New species."
653445 657491 OSCORP, the empire of evil.
657783 661245 We solved the horizon glide<br />and the multi-G balance issues.
662955 664957 I feel bad things for this guy.
665123 667751 Something's gonna happen.
670128 672297 Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.
672548 674383 - Norman.<br />- Mr. Osborn.
674550 678095 Always a pleasure to have<br />our board of directors visit.
678303 681723 I want to see the progress report<br />on human performance enhancers.
681890 686395 We tried vapor inhalation with rats.<br />Their strength increased by 800%.
686562 688438 - Excellent.<br />- Any side effects?
688605 689690 In one trial, yes.
689857 692526 An aberration. All the tests since<br />have been successful.
692776 694778 In Mr. Osborn's defense, you know...
694945 697281 ...this guy could be<br />a little more understanding...
697447 698907 ...a little more compassionate.
699074 701451 They're working on<br />some pretty serious stuff.
702995 705247 The military is known<br />for their compassion...
705414 707666 - ...and understanding.<br />- Absolutely.
707833 709418 Very empathetic.
711336 712462 Let's talk it out.
712629 715173 We need to take the whole line<br />back to formula.
717217 719636 - Back to formula?<br />- Dr. Osborn.
720804 722639 I'll be frank with you.
722890 727728 I never supported your program. We<br />have my predecessor to thank for that.
727895 730647 The general has approved<br />Quest Aerospace...
730814 733734 ...to build a prototype<br />of their exoskeleton design.
734067 737654 - They test in two weeks.<br />- And if your performance enhancers...
737821 741867 ...have not had a successful<br />human trial by that date...
742034 743493 ...I'm gonna pull your funding.
743660 745829 One of the conversations<br />I had with Sam early on...
745996 749082 ...before I even knew<br />if I wanted to do the film...
749249 752127 ...was, you know,<br />what's the tone of this film gonna be?
752294 753337 Is it gonna...?
753503 756131 Are we gonna try to make it<br />as believable as possible...
756298 759676 ...and have the fantasy<br />come out of characters...
759843 762512 ...that are grounded<br />and based in a reality...
762679 764264 ...or is it just gonna be...
764431 767184 ...you know,<br />a big, fun comic-book movie?
767351 769353 I said,<br />"Because I'd be interested in it...
769519 773482 ...if it was coming out<br />of real characters and truth."
773649 775859 And that's where<br />he was coming from.
776026 779696 And he was describing<br />the tone of it to me and...
782366 785869 Well, Sam was a big Spider-Man fan<br />as a kid too.
786036 787245 I don't know if you were.
787412 791458 I was not, but Sam apparently was<br />a gigantic Spider-Man fan...
791625 793502 ...with the thing hanging above...
793669 796713 ...like a poster or a painting<br />hanging above his bed...
796880 797965 ...and he read.
798131 802386 But I went back and read about<br />the first four years of issues...
802552 806223 - ...which is the period that Sam read.<br />- Yeah.
806390 808809 You know, the early stuff.
808976 811728 Basically, that's sort of<br />what the film covers too.
811895 814439 - Yeah.<br />- The creation of Spider-Man...
814606 818068 - ...and the beginning of...<br />- The origin story.
820028 821738 I hear there might be a sequel.
821905 823907 - Really?<br />- Yes.
824700 827536 When are they<br />talking about making that?
827703 829246 Some time in the spring, I think.
829413 832374 I hear, like, late March<br />they're gonna go into production.
832541 836294 I guess we're hearing<br />the same vague rumors then, yeah.
836461 840340 I think every other May, there'll be<br />a new Spider-Man movie for...
840507 842384 That's the idea.
842551 845345 For the next couple decades<br />or so.
846638 849766 I'm gonna have to, you know...
849933 853353 They'll have to recast me<br />as Uncle Ben one of these days.
853520 856732 Now, I do wanna say,<br />this effect, which was brilliant...
856898 859609 I do wanna clarify<br />that this is not my body...
859776 861611 ...the skinny dude.
861778 863905 They had me walk...
864698 868285 Or they had the kid walk<br />and then I had to match his walk.
868452 872164 <i>...This recombination lab,<br />we use synthesized...</i>
872372 874291 And they somehow<br />put my head on his body.
874458 875667 It was pretty clever.
875834 879129 <i>...combining the genetic<br />information from all three spiders...</i>
879963 881590 My nose looks pretty...
881757 884092 - Nostrils are pretty clear.<br />- Always a nice shot.
884259 886845 - Yeah.<br />- Is that your skull there in that shot?
887012 890140 That's not my actual skull.
891308 893518 Something's happening.
893977 896730 Seems like more than a dream.
896897 899941 Yeah, all those effects<br />were just genius.
900150 902652 I guess they spent<br />a little time on that...
902819 905655 - ...after we got done with our jobs.<br />- Oh, yeah.
905822 909242 Now, I'm asking you for the last time.<br />We can't do this.
909493 912954 A lot of the questions that I find<br />that I get from people in the street...
913121 915082 ...always have to do with the...
915248 918335 Not always, sometimes have to do<br />with the technical aspects of it.
918502 920921 And often people are asking me,<br />like I have a clue:
921088 923799 "How did they do that thing<br />with the...?" You know.
923965 926551 - I'm not sure. Right.<br />- I just, you know...
927719 931848 ...say my lines and try not to waste<br />anybody's time too much.
932015 935268 It begins catalyzation when the vapor<br />hits the bloodstream.
935435 938522 It's amazing how long it takes<br />to do all that stuff too.
938688 940273 40,000 years of evolution...
940440 944194 ...and we've barely tapped<br />the vastness of human potential.
945112 947906 This is a pretty interesting idea<br />for a villain actually...
948073 950617 ...you know,<br />human performance enhancers.
950784 954204 Yeah. It certainly resonates...
954371 957207 ...in a lot of different aspects<br />of real life.
958041 959376 Oh, that's cold.
960627 963964 A guy facing losing his company<br />and everything he's built...
964131 967300 ...and all his work<br />that he cares personally about...
967467 971596 These are some of the things that I,<br />you know...
973014 975892 That I thought would be tricky...
976059 979020 ...things to handle<br />that were handled pretty well.
979187 982691 Because that's where you can<br />really lose me in a film like this.
983316 988905 Being like a big action-y,<br />superhero film, you know.
990532 992367 Right, what are the themes<br />that it's...?
992534 994661 - What's it about besides...?<br />- Right.
994828 997497 It's not just like,<br />"Oh, a superhero, supervillain"...
997664 1002252 ...but there's personal stuff<br />going on for these characters.
1012721 1016057 That's one of the things you always<br />look for, or at least I do, that...
1016224 1020395 Especially playing a bad guy.<br />You know, is he just, you know...
1020562 1023190 ...a two-dimensional,<br />quote, unquote, bad guy or is he...
1023356 1026818 ...a human being that could be...?<br />Who's coming from somewhere?
1026985 1029446 Yeah, nothing interesting<br />about the other...
1029613 1032032 And Willem, obviously,<br />I mean, you know...
1032199 1033450 He does...
1033617 1036411 You wonder if, does he<br />make parts really fascinating...
1036578 1038121 ...or, you know, is he...
1038288 1041458 - Or is it written like that? Right.<br />- ...drawn to only the really...
1041625 1042959 ...quirky, interesting parts?
1043126 1045462 - Probably a little bit of both, you know.<br />- Yeah.
1046338 1048131 It's always...
1050717 1052761 ...hard for me<br />to go beyond the material.
1052928 1055931 I've just been fortunate,<br />I think and...
1056097 1059809 Selective and fortunate<br />to work on good things.
1060852 1063146 Yeah, that's really it.<br />It's both of those.
1063313 1066858 Yeah, and this was what<br />I love so much. It's like...
1067025 1068652 ...a bunch of art-house people...
1068818 1072197 - ...making a big movie, you know?<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1081498 1083416 A little late for school.
1084668 1086503 I'm 27 now but...
1086670 1088588 This was a great touch,<br />with the glasses.
1088755 1090382 - This is great.<br />- I don't remember...
1090548 1093551 ...if that's directly from the script,<br />or if that was...
1093718 1096638 I don't recall. Yeah.
1097097 1100016 But there were a lot of those<br />really nice little touches.
1100183 1103853 And the "Oh, by the way,<br />what the hell is my head on top of?"
1104020 1106815 - Tobey's been doing his sit-ups.<br />- Yeah.
1107691 1112654 That was five months of six days<br />a week, four hours a day...
1112821 1116700 - ...nutritionists, trainers...<br />- Right, for about eight seconds of...
1116866 1118743 - Right.<br />- Plus all the stunts and stuff...
1118910 1120829 ...and looking good in the suit but...
1120996 1125250 This is the thing that I think...
1125417 1127544 ...helps you buy it<br />for the rest of the movie.
1127711 1129212 Yeah, yeah.
1137971 1140640 I also did yoga for flexibility...
1140807 1143727 ...and martial arts and gymnastics.
1143893 1145895 What martial arts?
1146062 1147397 - Tae Kwon do or...?<br />- No.
1147564 1151651 This guy, Steven Ho,<br />who was my martial arts trainer...
1151818 1154404 - That was fun, that little stunt there.<br />- Yeah.
1154571 1156531 Yeah, now that was...<br />There was no effect.
1156698 1158116 - No effect.<br />- You did the deal?
1158283 1159909 They had a little lip for me to...
1160076 1163580 The top hand,<br />I had a little lip to grab onto...
1163747 1165332 ...and, yeah, just did it.
1165498 1167876 - It was simple but fun.<br />- Yeah. No, that was great.
1168043 1171921 And there were obviously a lot of<br />stunts and things that were done...
1172088 1175425 ...digitally and all that, but I thought<br />that was a great little moment.
1175592 1176885 Well, we discussed it too...
1177052 1180430 ...because we were talking about<br />maybe doing a flip or this or that...
1180597 1183475 ...and I said, "You know,<br />let's just do something...
1183641 1185185 ...that comes out of his energy."
1185352 1188021 The discussion wasn't just me,<br />but the discussion was:
1188188 1192192 "Let's do something that comes<br />out of his newfound energy...
1192359 1194361 - ...that wasn't too elaborate."<br />- Right.
1194527 1198031 And also if they caught him doing it,<br />it would be strange, but...
1198198 1201076 ...not like "Oh, you did<br />a double flip off of the staircase."
1201242 1203453 - Like, "What's up?"<br />- Yeah, yeah.
1203787 1205288 Hey, M.J.
1205455 1208124 This is a part we really wanted to...<br />Not this scene...
1208291 1210043 ...but this section of the movie...
1210210 1214798 ...just build it slowly, the discovery...
1214964 1217467 ...confusion...
1217634 1220136 ...fear and then acceptance...
1220303 1223640 - ...of his newfound powers.<br />- Oh, of the powers, yeah.
1225475 1227394 Probably my favorite part<br />of the film.
1227560 1229020 Yeah, this is a great sequence.
1229187 1232649 And actually, you know,<br />when I first saw it, I was...
1234067 1238196 ...unclear about when you slap<br />the side of the bus right there...
1238363 1241991 ...and it comes off in your hand.<br />I thought, "Oh, why did that...?"
1242367 1244244 It wasn't until a minute later,<br />I went:
1244411 1247080 - "Oh, because of the spiderweb."<br />- Yeah.
1247247 1250708 The little hairs that come out<br />of the...
1251334 1253837 But he doesn't know<br />what's going on there.
1254712 1259843 He being me playing him in there.
1264264 1268017 There's a really great pace<br />to the movie too.
1269394 1271312 Putting the different elements<br />together...
1271479 1275191 ...putting the different plots<br />together. You know, the way...
1275358 1276860 ...Sam and the editors out...
1277026 1281948 ...between your plot<br />and Willem's plot here...
1282282 1285827 ...and ultimately, the newspaper office<br />and all the other fun places.
1285994 1289372 There's a great piece they put in there<br />with that little scary moment.
1289539 1291332 - The whole theater jumped.<br />- Yeah.
1291624 1292834 But I agree with you.
1293001 1297922 But this is all really just setup<br />to getting...
1298089 1302719 ...to your character,<br />J. Jonah Jameson.
1302886 1304971 To the real central character<br />in the film.
1305138 1307432 This is just...
1307599 1311144 ...you know, all back-story,<br />so they can see what is really...
1311311 1314063 That's one of the things<br />that was so remarkable to me...
1314230 1317025 ...about how well done<br />this film is, is that...
1317192 1320028 ...there was so much exposition.
1320403 1323573 You know, really meeting<br />all these characters for the first time...
1323740 1327202 ...and really taking time<br />to get to know them.
1327368 1330747 - Oh, this was very cool too.<br />- Yeah, I love this stunt. It was fun.
1330914 1333875 I heard that took you three takes<br />to get all those things right.
1334042 1335084 You know what?
1335251 1340006 They were gonna do that digitally<br />and...
1340423 1342217 Someone came up with the idea...
1342383 1345261 ...of standing above the camera<br />and dropping all that stuff...
1345428 1347430 ...and hoping it landed right.
1347597 1349849 And I think we saved them<br />a bunch of money.
1350016 1351601 - Are you kidding me?<br />- Swear to God.
1351768 1355104 - I had no idea.<br />- We gave it a shot, you know.
1355772 1357524 I held the tray<br />and he dropped stuff...
1357690 1361027 ...and I had to move the tray around<br />and it just landed so we could...
1361486 1363446 I had assumed that<br />that was done digitally.
1363613 1365156 No.
1366074 1367700 It was not.
1370119 1375041 Because I'm a Method actor,<br />I actually have webbing in my wrist.
1375208 1377460 - You had that surgically implanted?<br />- Yes.
1377627 1380088 - You're intense, man.<br />- Yeah, very.
1380255 1385134 No, they had his...<br />Well, that's real but some of the...
1394978 1397397 This was a very funny sequence.<br />And then the...
1397564 1400233 - Yeah, the tray trailing behind you.<br />- Yeah.
1402235 1403903 Parker?
1408658 1411744 - A little prop acting there.<br />- Yeah.
1411911 1413538 It worked.
1420962 1422380 This was a sequence that...
1422547 1425341 ...I had no idea<br />what it was gonna end up like...
1425508 1427510 ...but the idea of it...
1428136 1429387 - ...sounded cool.<br />- Yeah.
1429554 1433141 The first time we really see<br />the Spidey-sense.
1435810 1438104 - It's a fight!<br />- Think you're pretty funny, freak?
1438271 1441316 There was so many<br />of those specialty shots and...
1441482 1444193 - Come on, Flash, stop.<br />- I don't wanna fight you, Flash.
1444360 1446821 - I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.<br />- Kick his ass.
1467050 1468092 Help him, Harry.
1473056 1474557 How'd he do that?
1474891 1477894 So did you work on that stuff,<br />that triple backward flip there?
1478061 1481939 I actually did and I...
1482440 1484901 I can't say that I did it as well<br />as the stuntman...
1485068 1487028 ...or anything like that...
1487195 1491199 ...but I was working<br />with my gymnastics coach...
1491366 1494661 ...and getting in the harness<br />and doing double backflips.
1495411 1499040 I never did a triple,<br />but I did some double backflips.
1501000 1502418 And I could pull them.
1502585 1505546 Sometimes the landings<br />weren't really smooth.
1505713 1507757 - You didn't stick the landing?<br />- Yeah.
1532699 1534784 One thing that worked well<br />about the movie...
1534951 1537203 ...but about this sequence is...
1537995 1540707 ...real Spider-Man fans who had...
1542417 1545628 ...all the knowledge about<br />the intricate details of this...
1545795 1548715 ...really appreciated<br />the attention to detail.
1548881 1550717 And people who didn't know<br />Spider-Man...
1550883 1552802 ...who were just going<br />to see a movie...
1552969 1554929 ...didn't feel they were<br />out of the loop.
1555096 1558808 - Yup.<br />- Because it all developed so well.
1558975 1562019 - Yeah. This is fun.<br />- This is great.
1562186 1564564 Yeah, I went to this...
1565148 1567734 ...convention, a sci-fi convention...
1567900 1570695 ...and people were so excited<br />when we showed them...
1570862 1573322 ...the scene in the cafeteria.
1573489 1575074 And they couldn't be more jazzed.
1575241 1579537 And, you know, like you said,<br />we were making the film for...
1579704 1582123 ...people who really knew<br />the comic book...
1582290 1584667 ...as well as people<br />who had no idea.
1584834 1586586 Right.
1589797 1592675 This was fun. I was actually...
1594302 1595762 Well, there I was on the roof...
1595928 1598681 ...and they had me on a wire<br />jumping down.
1599182 1601350 But the other stuff,<br />jumping from buildings...
1601517 1603186 ...I was in a parking lot...
1603352 1606105 ...with this huge green screen<br />behind me...
1606272 1609150 ...and a rig above me<br />that had wires hooked up.
1609317 1611778 And I was running<br />and they would yank me up about...
1611944 1612987 Go, web!
1613529 1614655 This was Sam's idea.
1614822 1618201 Just completely his idea.<br />And I was like, "Sam, are you sure?
1618868 1623206 You know, if it's not good,<br />please don't leave it in the movie.
1623372 1626042 Because I'm really putting myself<br />out there."
1626417 1629045 Everybody that works with Sam<br />has a few of those moments.
1629212 1631005 - Right.<br />- "You really want me to...?
1631172 1632632 Well, okay."
1632799 1634884 I just went for it and...
1635051 1638012 Yeah, it's great. This is one<br />of the big laughs in the movie.
1638179 1639722 Yeah, it was fun.
1640556 1644352 It was good. And that's why<br />I like working with people...
1644519 1647188 ...who I feel like I trust.<br />You know, I like their films.
1647355 1649315 I appreciate them as a filmmaker.
1649482 1652151 So then it gives me more freedom<br />to try things.
1652318 1655905 It's so important not to have that voice<br />in the back of your head warning you:
1656072 1658282 - Right.<br />- "You can't really trust this guy.
1658449 1660910 - You're gonna look like an idiot."<br />- Yeah.
1661077 1663996 So I've been very fortunate<br />during my whole career.
1664163 1665289 And with Sam it's great.
1665456 1667917 And I'm very excited<br />that he's doing the next one.
1668084 1669252 Yeah.
1673714 1675758 - I'll say that hurt.<br />- Yeah?
1675925 1677468 That hurt.
1677635 1681097 Some things actually hurt<br />on this movie.
1684433 1689605 And I will say that the stuntmen<br />who were doubling me...
1691065 1695027 ...some of the real Spider-men...
1695194 1699574 ...probably had a few... Or did have a<br />few more bumps and bruises than I did.
1699740 1701367 - Yeah.<br />- But I got my share too.
1701534 1703870 And they did a great job...
1704036 1707081 ...and not only<br />did the more risky things...
1707248 1711294 ...but also helped me choreograph<br />some of the moves when I was doing it.
1711460 1714422 Yeah. That's another<br />part of what's collaborative about it.
1714589 1717091 It's not like,<br />"Tobey's gonna go sit in his trailer...
1717258 1718801 ...while the stuntman comes in."
1718968 1721304 - Right.<br />- You guys worked together...
1722138 1725141 ...on making that transition smooth.
1725558 1728853 - Why don't you do them?<br />- Get in here and do the dishes.
1732356 1734317 Was this in Queens? This location?
1736444 1738362 I think so.
1738529 1741198 It was somewhere in New York.<br />They put you in a vehicle...
1741365 1742950 ...and took you there and...
1743117 1744702 - Yeah.<br />- It was across a bridge.
1744869 1745912 Yeah.
1746078 1749081 I know there was a Laundromat<br />down the street.
1749832 1752001 Did you get a little laundry done<br />between shots?
1752168 1754545 No, but I sat in there,<br />watched a basketball game.
1754712 1756839 - Yeah?<br />- I did, yeah.
1757006 1759550 I, of course, live in New York,<br />and all of my scenes...
1759717 1762345 ...which were to take place<br />in New York were shot in L.A.
1762511 1764972 In Los Angeles. Of course.
1765139 1767183 Yeah. Do you like Los Angeles?
1768851 1770186 I do not like Los Angeles.
1770353 1773189 You do not like Los Angeles.
1773356 1774357 I love New York.
1774523 1777735 My wife and I discuss moving out<br />to the West Coast once in a while...
1777902 1779820 - ...because her family is out here.<br />- Yeah.
1779987 1783199 And I've steadfastly resisted<br />thus far...
1783366 1785284 ...but we'll see. You know.
1785451 1788329 - You have to spend time in both.<br />- Yeah, you do.
1788496 1791582 Not to get too specific,<br />but you live in Manhattan?
1791749 1793501 Lived in Manhattan for a long time...
1793668 1796754 ...and then when our family grew,<br />we moved out to the burbs.
1796921 1799298 I see. Very good.
1799465 1803344 I love visiting New York.
1805429 1806931 I wanna...
1808057 1809392 ...act...
1810559 1812061 ...on-stage.
1812561 1814230 This is really the scene where...
1814397 1819735 I think Kirsten's character<br />is really a good character...
1819902 1821612 ...and she has a really good arc.
1821779 1825574 And that she's a little bit of a typical...<br />I don't wanna say "typical."
1825741 1827618 She's got the thing I can relate to...
1827785 1831288 ...which is being in school<br />and really wanting to be popular.
1831455 1834750 - Wanting to belong to the cool group.<br />- Right.
1834917 1838337 And she gets involved with people<br />maybe for the wrong reasons.
1838504 1843259 And she hasn't thus far,<br />in her home life or in school...
1843426 1846429 ...felt like anybody<br />has appreciated her...
1846595 1847763 ...or understood her...
1847930 1850599 ...or she's felt like she could<br />open up or trust anyone.
1850766 1852560 And Peter...
1854854 1859108 ...you know, is a pretty open kid.
1859275 1862278 And really<br />has been infatuated with her...
1862445 1863863 ...since he was 6 years old...
1864030 1867033 ...so to have the opportunity<br />to be one-on-one like this...
1867199 1870453 . and look at her and say,<br />"I'm here to listen and understand...
1870619 1872163 ...and care.
1872329 1873873 And whatever your troubles are...
1874040 1876250 ...you can share them with me<br />and trust me."
1876417 1879628 And he's very supportive<br />and encouraging.
1879795 1884175 It's so great also in a quote-unquote<br />action movie, a superhero movie...
1884341 1887428 ...to actually have<br />extended scenes like this...
1887595 1891182 ...that are really about the interaction<br />between these two kids...
1891348 1895811 ...and not just there to set up<br />the next car chase or whatever.
1895978 1897521 In so many movies today...
1897688 1901108 ...it's like your longest scene...
1901275 1904945 ...is 30 seconds or something,<br />you know.
1905112 1907114 You're doing<br />a one-and-a-half page scene...
1907281 1909658 ...and it's your big scene, you know.
1909825 1913329 I actually have to memorize<br />a couple of lines for...
1917750 1921003 Yeah, this and the scene later<br />in the hospital.
1921170 1924256 A lot of nice little scenes<br />with you and Kirsten.
1924423 1926509 And the rain of course.
1926675 1928010 Yeah.
1940356 1943192 And this was derived...
1943359 1946570 ...from the actual comic books.
1946737 1950991 - Him doing the wrestling match.<br />- Right.
1954078 1956205 Of course, this is you<br />doing all the artwork?
1956372 1959416 The drawing. Oh, yes, of course.
1960334 1963546 No. And to be honest with you,<br />I'm not even sure who...
1963712 1965089 - That same hand guy.<br />- Right.
1965256 1967007 - The same guy that got bit.<br />- Same guy.
1967174 1968717 You know...
1981772 1984567 This is a real credit to Sam<br />and the editors I think.
1984733 1989530 Because this is obviously<br />something they put together that...
1989697 1992074 - ...goes into his mind and...<br />- Right.
1992241 1993909 ...you know, becomes whimsical...
1994076 1997246 ...but it's supported with what's<br />going on with the character.
1997872 2000249 That's the kind of thing,<br />when you're shooting it...
2000416 2003836 ...it's one of those tedious days<br />where, "Now we're gonna do a shot...
2004003 2007923 - ...of you looking at your notebook."<br />- Right. Exactly.
2009258 2011760 And it all gets put together<br />and it's all worth it.
2014763 2016599 And Rosemary Harris,<br />who is so wonderful.
2016765 2018809 Oh, I love her.
2018976 2020352 She's great.
2020519 2023480 I've actually done a couple movies<br />that she was in...
2023647 2026901 ...with Sam directing,<br />and never worked with her, you know.
2027067 2030446 - Never had a scene with her.<br />- Yeah, she was in The <i>Gift.</i>
2030613 2032448 Something else or it was just The <i>Gift?</i>
2032615 2036035 That's the only other time<br />that I've been in a film with her.
2037077 2038871 And here's an example of...
2039038 2041290 ...another character<br />who's really progressed...
2041457 2043751 ...in terms of the superhero<br />and supervillain...
2043918 2046086 ...at a similar rate.
2046253 2049965 - Yeah, right.<br />- Which is what you were talking about.
2053135 2056472 Something's bothering him. Maybe<br />he's too embarrassed to tell me.
2056639 2059308 Maybe I'm too embarrassed<br />to ask him.
2060100 2062144 I just don't know anymore.
2063187 2067191 Cliff was very much into the part...
2067358 2072321 ...and it's a very important part<br />as Uncle Ben for Peter Parker.
2073447 2074990 And...
2076116 2078953 He just worked really hard<br />and would come up with...
2079119 2082081 He would write stuff<br />to either support scenes...
2082248 2085960 ...or as alternative dialogue...
2086126 2089171 ...and it was great.<br />He's a really poetic guy.
2090631 2094260 And he's a father himself,<br />so he was...
2094426 2096303 Because we haven't talked<br />for so long...
2096512 2098472 He seems like he would be<br />a cool dad.
2098639 2101517 You shirk your chores.<br />You have all those...
2101684 2105437 Yeah, this is such a pivotal scene<br />in the movie.
2105604 2109358 If you don't love this guy<br />and appreciate what he's saying...
2109525 2112361 ...and buy into this whole thing,<br />then...
2112528 2114863 I mean, this becomes<br />Peter's motivation, really...
2115030 2117199 ...for who Spider-Man is.
2117658 2119410 Yeah, and like you say, it's also...
2119576 2121328 I mean if you're a Spider-Man fan...
2121495 2124039 Oh, sorry. That was<br />one of the great jokes too.
2124206 2126875 "I know, I know. I know the changes<br />you're going through."
2127042 2128877 Yeah, yeah, kind of.
2129044 2133590 He says, "I went through exactly..."<br />No, not exactly.
2133757 2136010 - A little different.<br />- Right.
2137344 2140848 But if you're a Spider-Man fan,<br />then you see all this stuff coming.
2141015 2143809 You know what the guy's<br />gotta say in this scene.
2143976 2147688 But I think that's what's so great,<br />is it really felt like...
2147855 2150941 ...organic and natural and...
2151358 2154028 Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?
2154778 2156322 And I'm gonna go ahead and say...
2156488 2161243 ...that was also<br />Sam's great choice in casting...
2161410 2166665 ...in particular the guy who plays<br />Peter Parker-slash-Spider-Man.
2167249 2168500 Indeed.
2168667 2170919 - Just kidding.<br />- That's one of the things...
2171086 2173881 ...that Sam does so well, you know.
2174048 2176216 Get the right people<br />for the right parts.
2184224 2186935 Little red sweatshirt coming out<br />of the back of the jeans.
2187102 2190564 Little subtle touch<br />that probably most people...
2190731 2191982 ...didn't see there.
2192149 2194777 Yeah, I'd be among<br />those most people that missed that.
2194943 2197196 Including you, yeah.
2208374 2210751 This was the first...
2212628 2215547 ...big sequence we shot. We shot<br />some stuff in my bedroom first.
2215714 2218050 And then came...
2218217 2220469 The shirt-off scene<br />was the first day of work.
2220636 2221720 - Oh, really?<br />- Yeah.
2221887 2223555 But then this was like...
2223722 2225599 ...the next couple weeks<br />or something.
2225766 2227726 Or next 10 days.<br />And we had a huge crowd...
2227893 2231146 ...and it was fun working with...
2231480 2234608 ..."Macho Man" Randy Savage.
2234775 2236443 Because he knows<br />how to work crowds.
2236610 2239696 And these are extras<br />who signed up and were excited...
2239863 2243033 ...but after four or five days<br />of sitting around...
2243200 2246829 ...with their brown paper-bag lunches,<br />it's like...
2246995 2249998 - The novelty kind of wears off.<br />- Yeah, the novelty wears off.
2250165 2252668 And he would perform for them...
2252835 2254795 ...and he would get me in<br />on the action.
2254962 2258257 He would whisper things to me,<br />"Okay, now do this and do that."
2258424 2261051 - And I would, you know...<br />- You would do it, of course...
2261218 2263345 - ...because you're not stupid.<br />- Right.
2263512 2266974 And the guy's arm<br />is bigger than my chest.
2267891 2269726 No, no. Sign me up.
2270018 2272020 - This is a funny character here too.<br />- Yeah.
2272187 2275357 ...Understand the NYWL is not<br />responsible for any injury you may and...
2275524 2277818 "Probably Will." Yeah.
2277985 2280237 And you're participating<br />under your own free will?
2280446 2281530 Yes.
2281697 2285492 Down the hall to the ramp.<br />May God be with you. Next.
2288078 2290330 Told you! Told you!
2290539 2292332 Winner!
2292541 2293750 Next victim!
2298338 2301216 Yeah, I think this is the first part<br />of the movie where...
2301383 2303218 ...I'm covering<br />my 4-year-old's eyes...
2303385 2305304 - ...when we were watching it.<br />- Oh, yeah.
2306180 2308307 I'm surprised sometimes<br />that people are like:
2308474 2310893 "Oh, yeah, my 3-year-old<br />loved the movie."
2311059 2314438 - I'm like, "Really? Okay."<br />- Yeah.
2314605 2317733 One of the nice things<br />about the flavor of the movie...
2317900 2321570 Certainly that last sequence with<br />you and Willem gets pretty intense...
2321737 2324698 ...but it's not too scary...
2324865 2328952 ...for a 9-, or 10-, or 11-<br />or 12-year-old.
2329119 2332664 No, my little guy has actually<br />only seen a few selected scenes.
2332831 2335959 - Portions of it.<br />- But I gotta tell you, in all honesty...
2336126 2337878 - ...he's a huge Spider-Man fan.<br />- Yeah?
2338045 2340797 He's jumping off the bunk bed<br />just like Spider-Man!
2340964 2342925 - He was Spider-Man for Halloween.<br />- Oh, yes.
2343091 2344927 Completely uncoerced, I promise.
2345469 2347429 This is Sam Raimi here<br />I'm talking to.
2347596 2349765 - That's his hand. That's Sam.<br />- Okay, all right.
2349932 2352100 That's his Alfred Hitchcock<br />appearance.
2352267 2353310 - Exactly.<br />- Excellent.
2353477 2354770 I did not know that either.
2354937 2357397 We were all encouraging him,<br />"You have to do it."
2357564 2360567 He was throwing stuff at me.<br />He loves to get involved like that.
2360734 2363195 He was one of the people<br />throwing popcorn.
2363362 2366782 And later he throws rocks at me<br />and all kinds of stuff.
2366949 2368742 Fake rocks, but...
2368909 2371954 And he would tell people, "Really,<br />no, throw it right in his face."
2372120 2374122 And I love that Bruce Campbell...
2374289 2375624 ...who is...
2375791 2379086 Who Sam has worked with<br />numerous times...
2379253 2381922 ...is the guy<br />who introduces Spider-Man...
2382089 2383632 ...and gives Spider-Man his name.
2383799 2387636 A little good piece of history<br />for them, you know?
2388887 2391807 Bruce told me,<br />he was one of the first to warn me:
2391974 2395018 "Listen, Sam likes to get involved.
2395185 2397437 He likes to throw things at you."<br />He was, like...
2397604 2400899 He kept prodding him with a stick<br />in one of the <i>Evil</i> Dead movies.
2401066 2402901 - There's Bruce right there.<br />- Yeah.
2404194 2408490 This is some kind of mistake.<br />I didn't sign up for a cage match!
2410617 2414246 He doesn't really know what the extent<br />of his powers are right now, you know?
2414413 2417749 He just wants the girl. He wants<br />to make the three grand to buy the car.
2417916 2420711 Basically everybody's motivation<br />at that age, pretty much.
2420877 2422754 - At that age?<br />- Yeah, okay, sorry.
2422921 2425591 - Does it change?<br />- I forget, you're still a young pup.
2425757 2427593 I'm 27. Does it change?
2427759 2429177 You tell me because I know...
2429344 2432389 - ...you're a couple years older.<br />- No, it doesn't change.
2432556 2434933 - When the kids come along...<br />- Right.
2435434 2438645 ...it's slightly different. But I'm 47<br />and I still try and impress...
2438812 2441023 - ...my wife once in a while.<br />- There you go.
2442983 2444693 How long did<br />this whole sequence take?
2445485 2449865 I don't recall exactly.<br />I feel like it was like a week or so.
2451783 2457039 And this was a chair<br />made of a different material...
2457205 2461209 ...but was like an aluminum.<br />So it was still a metal.
2461376 2463045 - They would...<br />- And he was still...
2463211 2465255 - ...wailing on you.<br />- He would bang you...
2465422 2468216 ...but it didn't really...<br />He would just kind of pop it.
2468383 2471011 - Like he hits and then pulls back.<br />- Yeah.
2471887 2474473 But I always like<br />a little contact because...
2474640 2476808 ...it gives me something to react to.
2477684 2481063 Oh, yeah, there's nothing worse<br />than a stunt fight where there's...
2481229 2482731 You're really having to fake it.
2482898 2484900 There's one thing worse,<br />getting hurt badly.
2485067 2486526 -Right.
2486693 2490447 And those bars had some kind of<br />metal inside of them...
2490614 2494242 ...and were just padded.<br />But I think, you know...
2494660 2498580 I think he was feeling<br />a little bruised up after that stuff.
2498747 2501917 See, that's such a great shot there.
2502084 2505921 And Sam stays on your eyes maybe<br />twice as long as a lot of guys would.
2506088 2509424 - Yeah.<br />- But it's all worth it.
2509591 2511259 Now get out of here.
2512886 2515722 A hundred bucks'?<br />The ad said 3000.
2515931 2518308 Well, check it again, webhead.
2518475 2522354 It said three grand for three minutes.<br />You pinned him in two.
2522562 2525941 For that, I give you 100.<br />You're lucky to get that.
2526108 2527484 I need that money.
2527943 2531029 I missed the part<br />where that's my problem.
2539121 2542457 - Hey, what the hell...?<br />- Put the money in the bag.
2544292 2545627 Hurry UP!
2551967 2554052 Hey! He stole the gate!
2554219 2556179 Stop that guy!
2556471 2559015 Stop him! He's got my money!
2559224 2560475 Thanks.
2561643 2564146 What's the hell's the matter with you?<br />You let him go!
2564312 2566523 Cut him off in the lobby<br />and call the cops!
2566690 2570736 You could've taken that guy apart.<br />Now he'll get away with my money.
2570902 2573155 I missed the part<br />where that's my problem.
2575282 2577743 A little vindictive there.
2578660 2580912 Pleased with himself.
2587085 2590213 Now, that's where people who<br />don't know the plot of Spider-Man...
2590380 2592048 ...are thinking:
2592215 2595594 "Yeah, okay, that was kind of glib<br />and kind of clever.
2595761 2598889 But I'm not sure if I'm liking<br />what this guy's doing right there."
2599055 2601391 Yeah. Well, that's<br />what I like about it too.
2601558 2605687 It's, again, different layers<br />to a character.
2605854 2607022 He's not just...
2607189 2610066 You know, he's a normal person<br />who makes mistakes.
2610233 2613528 Right. Yeah, yeah.<br />He makes bad choices and is not...
2614780 2615822 This is just...
2615989 2618366 - What happened?<br />- Carjacker. He's been shot.
2618575 2621995 We just called the paramedics.<br />They're on their way.
2622204 2623580 Uncle Ben?
2624498 2625999 Uncle Ben.
2629753 2631087 Uncle Ben?
2634716 2636218 Peter.
2637093 2638887 I'm here, Uncle Ben.
2644518 2645727 Peter.
2667707 2670752 They got the shooter.<br />He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.
2670961 2675674 We got three cars in pursuit.<br />All right, folks. Come on, move back.
2681012 2684015 - That's a great transition.<br />- Yeah.
2713795 2715755 - No.<br />- Yeah, how was that...
2715922 2718425 ...wall-climbing effect done?
2718592 2722429 That would be John Dykstra<br />and his team of magicians...
2722596 2724431 ...animating...
2724973 2726641 Animating that sequence.
2727434 2730061 Which I'm not sure<br />why it was animated exactly.
2730228 2732689 I feel like it could have...
2733189 2737652 But some of this stuff is<br />pretty amazing that they did. It's...
2738111 2741448 This was green screen,<br />they shot me.
2741615 2747662 And then they probably shot some<br />kind of plate shot for this.
2747829 2749748 I don't even remember<br />how we did all this.
2749915 2752042 You're going between<br />live-action and animation.
2752208 2754419 - Yeah. Exactly.<br />- And it's really... You know...
2754586 2759674 ...I've never been a huge fan<br />of the computer animation...
2759841 2762469 ...but it really... It's getting...
2762969 2765096 - It's getting pretty good now.<br />- Yeah.
2765263 2768683 Really, it's pretty seamless<br />in this movie.
2768850 2773021 It's certainly the best<br />that I've seen in any of...
2773188 2775398 ...the movies I've seen<br />with computer animation.
2775565 2778193 It's pretty great. You're<br />dealing with the progression...
2778360 2780695 - ...of how good Peter is here.<br />- Right.
2780862 2784783 Because, you know,<br />he's a little awkward and his...
2786076 2791623 The way his body moves around.<br />And he slowly gets the hang of it.
2794501 2798129 And part of this,<br />I was actually on a car.
2798838 2802050 And Michael Papa john was actually<br />shooting live rounds at you or...?
2803051 2806054 They weren't live rounds, no.<br />They were...
2807430 2808848 I'm not sure exactly.
2812268 2814854 That would be animated.
2815230 2816898 You didn't do that jump?
2817065 2818775 No.
2819776 2822904 But then I was there<br />on the car moving.
2829911 2831579 That stuff was a lot of fun for me.
2831746 2836376 Very different stuff for me,<br />different than anything I'd ever done.
2836543 2839921 And it was fun to do that.
2840088 2844426 I think that's one of the things that<br />almost every actor I've worked with...
2844592 2848596 You know, there's... Again we<br />hearken back to that 9-year-old boy...
2848763 2851850 ...part of you. Just to be running<br />around, jumping on stuff.
2852017 2855562 And doing action sequences<br />and fights.
2855729 2860233 You know, that's part of the fantasy<br />about being in the movies...
2860400 2862902 - ...that you had when you were a kid.<br />- Exactly.
2863069 2866489 To be, like, stimulated creatively<br />as an adult...
2866656 2869451 ...and get to play as a child<br />in the playground, like:
2869617 2872787 "Oh, I get to be<br />in a superhero movie, you know?
2872954 2874414 Oh, that's cool."
2874581 2878084 You know, and do,<br />like, action sequences.
2879836 2882964 Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.<br />Give me a chance!
2883131 2887635 What about my uncle?<br />Did you give him a chance? Did you?
2888887 2892724 And here he realizes that<br />he is responsible or feels responsible...
2892891 2896269 - ...for his uncle's death.<br />- Right.
2897270 2900315 His actions have come back<br />to haunt him.
2911076 2912160 See you.
2933848 2937310 <i>Freeze! We've got the place<br />completely surrounded.</i>
2959582 2965839 They actually built the falcon thing<br />I'm sitting on in a studio...
2966005 2969050 ...and the rest was a plate shot.
2969217 2971219 Like green screen.
2979811 2982397 Oh, no. My God.
2985775 2988278 This is a scene where<br />you don't get in on Rosemary...
2988444 2991322 ...but I came in and she just like...
2992115 2995827 You know? She blew me away. I came<br />in, I didn't even have to do anything.
2995994 2999622 Just look at her and just, you know,<br />I was falling to pieces watching her.
2999789 3005628 And that's one of those scenes,<br />it's so effective and... In a way...
3005795 3009632 ...when I'm doing a scene like that,<br />I'm like, "Yeah, but let's see our faces.
3009799 3012927 Let's see the emotion that we're..."<br />But, you know, we've seen that.
3013094 3016389 We saw that in Uncle Ben's<br />death scene with you...
3016556 3020101 ...and it's so interesting<br />to have that...
3020268 3022312 - ...further-away perspective...<br />- Yeah.
3022478 3024647 ...on that gut-wrenching<br />emotional moment.
3024814 3027150 It is interesting that she's...<br />Despite the fact...
3027317 3029402 ...the camera's on her back<br />the whole time...
3029569 3031779 - ...and it's, you know, 30 feet away...<br />- Yeah.
3031946 3034490 ...she knows... Well, obviously,<br />she's a great actress.
3034657 3037202 She's working just as hard<br />as if it were a close-up.
3037368 3039787 - Absolutely.<br />- That's what makes that scene work.
3039954 3042624 If you two just hit your marks,<br />went where you were told...
3042790 3047879 ...because it's a long shot,<br />then it wouldn't be effective.
3048671 3051299 - That was another great little transition.<br />- Yeah.
3052634 3058473 "Chess." That's what we said there.<br />"Chess." Oh, man.
3061309 3063728 It's not quite the same<br />without Uncle Ben.
3065104 3068608 I think it's about a month later...
3069442 3071486 ...after his death.
3075073 3076824 And this triangle is interesting...
3076991 3080453 ...because you have<br />James and his father...
3080620 3084165 ...and, you know...
3085250 3091172 James, who's Harry Osborn, isn't<br />quite what Norman wants in a son.
3091339 3095218 - Right.<br />- And my character, Peter, is more...
3095843 3099347 You know, a science whiz<br />who really appreciates his work...
3103309 3108022 ...and is driven and wants to do<br />things for himself.
3108940 3113319 It creates some jealousy for Harry.
3113486 3118491 But I really crave that father figure<br />and that mentor.
3118658 3122036 To get close to somebody like that<br />who has the kind of accomplishments...
3122203 3125039 ...he has in science<br />is amazing for Peter's character.
3125206 3126666 Right.
3128710 3130795 And this is after.
3135049 3138136 It's an empty house<br />without Uncle Ben.
3176758 3178968 I missed him a lot today.
3181554 3183056 I know.
3183639 3186976 Acting's funny,<br />because this is one of those scenes...
3187143 3191189 ...that's kind of a tough scene,<br />for me anyways.
3191898 3194317 And we did it a few times...
3194942 3200573 ...and, you know, just one time<br />I got hooked into it and it felt right.
3201115 3203284 - And the other times didn't. You know?<br />- Yeah.
3203451 3207747 They say, you know, it's like<br />lightening in a bottle or something.
3207914 3211459 You're just there to... Turn the camera<br />on, you hope to catch the moments.
3211626 3212668 Right.
3212835 3217465 And a lot of the other time... A lot of<br />the other takes here, I felt like I was...
3218883 3224722 You know, I wasn't connected to it,<br />or I was pushing or it felt okay.
3227934 3230019 This one... And I don't know how it...
3230186 3232522 I'm not talking about<br />how it comes off to people...
3232688 3236901 ...but for me, it felt honest.
3238319 3239320 Well, and that's a...
3240446 3243449 Right there is one of the differences<br />between working on stage...
3243616 3247078 ...and working in the movies,<br />you know, because you do get...
3247245 3248704 You get the opportunity to...
3248871 3251165 - Do it more than once.<br />- ...have a few sort of:
3251332 3254502 "Well, that one was okay.<br />Let's try it again." And...
3255420 3259006 It's also always good<br />to have the other actor in the scene...
3260091 3264053 ...you know, really working with you<br />and connecting with you...
3264220 3266514 - ...and helping to bring that out.<br />- I need that.
3266681 3270268 I mean, I... I'm not... I'm not good...
3270435 3272854 I mean, I won't say "not good"...
3274689 3278359 ...but for me, I feed so much<br />off of the other actor, you know?
3278526 3279986 Yeah.
3281154 3283531 And just the sort of,<br />the crying thing itself.
3283698 3286409 I mean, there are a lot of tricks<br />that you can use...
3286576 3288578 ...to have water<br />coming out of your eyes...
3288744 3292498 - ...but if it's not connected...<br />- Right.
3292665 3295877 ...and coming from<br />somewhere inside...
3296043 3299672 ...at least I think... You know, I think<br />you can always tell the difference.
3299839 3303926 Yeah. Well, actually,<br />I don't wanna get into that...
3304093 3307763 ...but there's<br />Sean Peon's performance...
3307930 3310975 <i>...in Dead Man Walking.</i>
3311142 3314061 There's a whole sequence<br />where he's not really shedding tears...
3314228 3318566 ...but he's, like, shaking,<br />almost like convulsing with emotion.
3318733 3320651 There's no tears<br />coming out of his eyes...
3320818 3323321 ...but he's... I mean,<br />I'm so there with his character.
3323488 3326449 He's working so hard to not<br />have the tears come out of his eyes.
3326616 3328326 - Unbelievable.<br />- Yeah, yeah.
3328493 3331412 - Yeah, he can act a little bit.<br />- Yeah, he's all right.
3331579 3334749 So all this stuff when, you know,<br />Spider-Man's doing his thing...
3334916 3339879 Now, that's Lucy. That was just<br />Lucy Lawless who plays Xena...
3340046 3342632 ...which Sam is involved<br />in the TV show.
3342798 3346052 So she made a little cameo<br />that probably most people...
3346219 3348346 Did not know that either.<br />Quite the makeup job.
3348513 3350348 Yeah, exactly.
3350515 3356354 Those were the Twin Towers reflected<br />in his eye there for a second.
3358231 3361943 - Now the movie gets going here.<br />- Thank God!
3362109 3364862 Like a breath of fresh air.
3366572 3369075 Really uptight fresh air.
3370618 3373287 Great head of hair<br />on the guy though.
3374455 3378417 This is what's fun too<br />about being an actor. It's like...
3378793 3382630 ...of course, I know it's you, but<br />you're disappearing into a character.
3382797 3385424 It's a really definitive character...
3385591 3389595 ...both in his look and in his attitude,<br />you know?
3389762 3394100 It's like, people... I would tell people,<br />"Oh, yeah. That's J.K. Simmons.
3394267 3396811 He was in this and that."<br />"Really? That's the same guy?
3396978 3399772 Get out of here." You know.
3399981 3401232 Every copy.
3401774 3407655 That's the fun part of being the<br />semi-anonymous character actor...
3407822 3412451 ...to be different all the time.<br />And that, of course, is...
3412618 3414495 - ...Ted Raimi...<br />- Right.
3414662 3418124 ...being abused by his boss,<br />as he is abused by his older brother...
3418291 3420042 ...the director.
3421002 3422044 Very much so.
3422211 3425423 Put an ad on the front page:<br />"Cash for a picture of Spider-Man."
3425756 3429218 He doesn't wanna be famous?<br />I'll make him infamous!
3431804 3436684 There's the Moondance Diner.
3436851 3439395 A landmark downtown.
3441397 3445985 Peter Parker is seeing Mary Jane<br />for the first time since graduation.
3448487 3451866 - What are you doing around here?<br />- Begging for a job. How about you?
3452867 3455202 These are of course,<br />all extras that you see...
3455369 3458789 ...despite how crowded<br />New York can be.
3461375 3464211 At least in the local area there.
3464378 3466213 Right. So you have...
3467381 3470343 ...hundreds of people<br />working crowd control et cetera...
3470509 3472553 ...in New York's finest<br />and everybody else...
3473054 3476057 ...cordoning off the area,<br />keeping...
3476807 3478726 ...the fans and the curious onlookers...
3478893 3482063 <i>wand the photographers,<br />at cetera, away.</i>
3482229 3484523 Yeah. With people it's kind of fun...
3484690 3488527 ...you know, because they're excited<br />about what we're doing...
3488694 3491572 ...and so I kind of like that.
3491739 3497161 It took me a little getting used to<br />having several photographers...
3498245 3501582 ...in your eyeline as you're shooting<br />something, just clicking away.
3501916 3504293 - That's nice.<br />- It was disconcerting at first...
3504460 3506420 ...but then I got used to it.
3506587 3509256 And they try to strike deals<br />with you too, you know:
3509423 3512093 "Give me a couple good shots<br />and I'll leave you alone."
3512259 3514387 - Yeah? Great.<br />- Yeah.
3516263 3519016 Yeah, and then once you do that<br />for one guy, then you...
3519183 3521644 Then they're calling all their buddies.
3521811 3524730 Getting on the paparazzi hotline.
3524897 3526649 But...
3528609 3534281 There's Peter being, in her eyes,<br />supportive and understanding...
3534448 3536450 ...unlike other people in her life.
3536617 3538494 Let's get some lunch some evening.
3538786 3540538 And him...
3543290 3546836 ...still being affected<br />and infatuated by her...
3547628 3550005 ...but just finding out<br />that he's been deceived...
3550172 3554051 ...by his roommate-slash-best friend,<br />Harry Osborn.
3564437 3566897 Timing's perfect. Hey.
3567106 3570401 Five new contracts. It'll be great.
3572528 3575197 Storming Norman's<br />making his weekly inspection.
3575448 3578492 Better than the average<br />two broke, out-of-work guys'...
3578659 3580745 - Apartment?<br />- ...Manhattan apartment. Yeah.
3580911 3583581 Well, there was actually<br />big discussions about that...
3583748 3588669 ...and how to do it,<br />and it was basically decided that...
3588836 3590796 ...Norman probably owned<br />the building.
3590963 3594216 - Right.<br />- And gave the apartment...
3594592 3599346 ...to his son.<br />And I kept talking to them about...
3600222 3604685 You know, and they agreed that it<br />should be somewhat modest in size...
3604852 3607897 ...inside, despite its size.<br />Because it's obviously...
3608063 3610816 - ...a pretty nice place for Manhattan.<br />- Yeah.
3610983 3613944 I don't think<br />I could afford that apartment.
3614111 3616572 - Well, not before Spider-Man.<br />- Right.
3616739 3619450 - Maybe after the sequel.<br />- Yeah, yeah.
3619909 3623162 Pete, you're probably looking<br />for a job now, right?
3623370 3626207 Dad, maybe you can help him out.
3626373 3630711 - No, I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.<br />- It's no problem. I'll make a few calls.
3630878 3635174 No, I couldn't accept it, sir.<br />I like to earn what I get. I'll find work.
3635341 3637009 I respect that.
3637718 3639845 You want to make it<br />on your own steam.
3640513 3641847 That's great.
3642723 3645059 What other skills do you have,<br />Parker?
3645267 3647228 I was thinking about photography.
3650356 3651607 Hello.
3653526 3655820 Let's go! Move it!
3656987 3658656 Watch the street!
3659281 3661784 - And this was on the backlot.<br />- I was just gonna say...
3661951 3665538 ...we didn't block off the New York<br />streets for this sequence, but...
3666372 3668666 ...a good re-creation.
3671252 3674255 And then all the stuff<br />in the Spider-Man suit...
3674421 3677716 ...I had to go back<br />and loop everything.
3677883 3681262 You know, go in the studio<br />with just a microphone...
3681679 3684557 ...and say lines to pictures and stuff.
3685891 3688853 Crap, crap. Megacrap.
3689019 3690771 I'll give you $200 for all of them.
3690938 3693649 I was disappointed at the premiere,<br />they laughed so hard...
3693816 3696902 ...at the first "crap,"<br />that they missed "mega crap."
3697069 3698112 That's it.
3698279 3701073 Obviously a very supportive<br />audience there that night.
3702616 3705160 Give you 300.<br />That's the standard freelance fee.
3705327 3707663 - Tear up page one. Run that photo.<br />- Headline?
3707955 3711250 "Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?<br />Exclusive <i>Daily Bugle</i> Photos."
3711750 3716130 I went and spent couple days hanging<br />around at the New York Post...
3716297 3722303 ...soaked up the atmosphere, got the<br />sense of the big-city newspaper office...
3722469 3725472 ...and what it's like.<br />And that line about...
3725639 3728601 ...how much I'll give you<br />for the photos was actually...
3729935 3734607 ...one of the little details<br />that I gleaned during that process.
3734773 3738110 - In terms of what standard fees...?<br />- What's really the going rate for...?
3738277 3740738 And how'd we do?<br />Is it pretty realistic?
3740905 3741947 - We changed it.<br />- Right.
3742114 3745576 Because I think it had originally<br />been something different in the script.
3745743 3751707 And here's Elizabeth Banks,<br />plays Betty Brant...
3752791 3754960 ...a classic...
3756253 3761008 ...Spider-Man relationship<br />between him and her.
3762968 3764970 I'm working with her<br />again in a movie now.
3765137 3766180 - Oh, yeah?<br />- Yeah.
3766347 3770809 - Now, will she be back in sequels?<br />- I haven't seen the script...
3770976 3775189 ...but I imagine. I mean, she works at<br />the Bugle, so she'll at least be there.
3775356 3777107 Whether there's<br />any future with them...
3777274 3782571 ...I don't know. There's certainly...<br />Stuff goes on with them in the comics.
3782738 3786533 Right. Maybe in the seventh<br />or eighth sequel, we'll get to that.
3786700 3788369 Yes.
3790204 3794208 I'm basically planning on semi-retiring.<br />I'll do a Spider-Man every two years.
3794375 3796502 - And that's it.<br />- Hope that'll pay the mortgage.
3796669 3798295 Do a little theater here and there.
3798462 3799505 - Sure.<br />- Yeah, why not?
3799672 3804134 And my kids can go to a state school.<br />You know, I'll be taking it easy.
3805052 3808055 And they pull the company<br />out from under him.
3808389 3809723 ...With entrenched management.
3809890 3812267 The deal is off if you come with it.
3812434 3815854 The board expects your resignation<br />in 30 days.
3816063 3818023 You can't do this to me.
3821193 3823487 I started this company.
3824530 3826949 You know how much I sacrificed?!
3828158 3829868 He's starting to crack up a little.
3830035 3832705 A little Mr. Hyde coming out there<br />in Dr. Jekyll.
3832871 3836333 Norman, the board is unanimous.
3836792 3840796 We're announcing the sale<br />after the World Unity Festival.
3840963 3842464 I'm sorry.
3843465 3845592 You're out, Norman.
3847803 3853225 I have a feeling these OSCORP guys<br />are gonna meet an unhappy ending.
3853392 3856353 Something dark<br />is looming in the future.
3856520 3859273 They gave him<br />a little too much information.
3859440 3863444 They're gonna announce it<br />right after the Unity Fest.
3863610 3867948 And here we are in Times Square,<br />Southern California.
3869116 3870659 Yes.
3871660 3875247 And Peter has his first<br />non-Spider-Man assignment.
3878584 3880669 Macy Gray.
3882588 3885549 Coincidentally,<br />a Columbia recording artist.
3885716 3887176 Really?
3887342 3889845 - Strange how that happens.<br />- Yes.
3890012 3893265 Funny enough, I was promoting<br />Spider-Man in Europe...
3894308 3897394 ...and she was touring in Europe<br />and I bumped into her...
3897561 3901815 ...in three different countries<br />while I was promoting Spider-Man...
3901982 3906904 ...and I hung out with her a little bit.<br />And my friend played in front of her.
3907071 3909656 A buddy of mine who's a musician...
3910324 3913535 ...was, you know, just playing<br />the guitar and singing.
3913702 3916663 She was like, "Why don't you<br />come up and open for me?"
3916830 3920459 - Get out of here.<br />- He went up. Swear to God. In England.
3920626 3923003 I forgot the theater,<br />but it was like 5000 people...
3923170 3926924 ...and he walks out on the stage,<br />just him and his plug-in acoustic...
3927091 3930135 ...and he played a Beatles song...
3930302 3931345 ...which I won't hum.
3932805 3936058 M.J., would you do me a favor?<br />I forgot my drink inside.
3939812 3943357 A little Spidey-sense. Something...
3946819 3948445 What could go wrong<br />in Times Square?
3948612 3949613 Right.
3949780 3954701 - Have you seen my father around?<br />- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.
3957663 3959832 Oh, I think he's coming.
3966672 3969174 - What is that?<br />- Must be new this year.
3974054 3975305 What is that?
3975472 3976557 That's our glider!
3986275 3988235 One of the times<br />when Sam is at his best...
3988402 3991697 ...Sam Raimi, is doing the scenes<br />with lots of extras...
3991864 3996493 ...when he comes out<br />to inspire them...
3997828 4000581 ...and try to get the reactions<br />that he's looking for...
4000747 4005002 ...out of groups of 10, or 20,<br />or 100 or 4000 people.
4005544 4007421 This was such a big job for him too.
4007588 4012509 He was directing, like, three or four<br />units at a time sometimes, you know.
4012676 4014428 It was unbelievable.
4017181 4020893 This shot I like, coming up of the...
4021059 4024938 - There's Stan. There. Stan the man.<br />- That was Stan Lee. Right there.
4033322 4038368 Peter risking his secret identity<br />to save a couple people.
4042956 4046460 - A little bit of a Superman shot.<br />- The Clark Kent moment there, yeah.
4046627 4049546 - Why I loved it though, it was good.<br />- A little homage.
4049713 4052549 I was a big Superman fan as a kid.
4053675 4056470 Well, you know, I was that age.
4059264 4061058 Very tasteful deaths.
4064186 4066063 Hello, my dear.
4067064 4068899 It's Spider-Man!
4069608 4073403 That was Laura Ziskin's daughter.<br />Our producer.
4076823 4081870 Willem basically was insisting<br />on doing almost everything himself.
4082037 4083330 Yeah?
4083789 4085666 And part of the reason was...
4087125 4090420 ...because he's so specific with<br />his physicality of the character.
4090587 4093131 And the stuntmen were great, but...
4094424 4098136 ...you know, Willem did it the way<br />Willem did it, you know.
4098303 4101348 He really acts<br />with every ounce of his body.
4102391 4105936 And he's very in shape.<br />He's a seasoned yogi...
4106103 4107980 ...and has a lot of control...
4108939 4110357 ...of his body...
4110857 4115237 ...even though he hit me and<br />kicked me many times for real.
4115404 4118073 Well, he probably meant to.
4118240 4121660 Yeah. I think so. It was fun.
4121827 4123370 But, you know, I'm like...
4124371 4130043 ...the younger actor<br />working with the guy I admire...
4130210 4134047 ...and I'm holding up<br />on my punches, you know.
4157154 4163243 Now, both you and Willem had the<br />constraint of working in those outfits...
4163410 4166580 ...which obviously were<br />hot and uncomfortable...
4166747 4170751 - ...and limited your visibility, et cetera.<br />- Yeah.
4171376 4176089 Well, Willem's was<br />actually fairly heavy, his suit.
4178216 4181636 So I know... He had this, like,<br />special chair between takes...
4181803 4184598 ...so he could relieve<br />some of the weight of the suit.
4184765 4186558 Mine was not that heavy...
4187351 4191646 ...but it's a one-piece that I couldn't<br />get in and out of myself...
4191813 4193690 ...and my lenses would fog up<br />a little...
4193857 4197444 - ...so the vision would be restricted.<br />- Yeah.
4198362 4201031 If I ever had to use the restroom<br />or get a sip of water...
4201198 4203575 ...it was, like, a 30-minute process.
4203742 4205786 And the zippers broke all the time.
4205952 4208330 They weren't even gonna<br />put zippers on it...
4208497 4210665 ...and I insisted.
4212376 4216463 There were gonna be zippers, but they<br />weren't gonna put the little handles on.
4216630 4220175 They did, but they broke anyways.<br />They ended up stitching me in the suit.
4220342 4224471 Sewing the suit up<br />at least 60 percent of the time.
4225138 4227849 Don't mind us.<br />She just needs to use the elevator.
4228392 4231853 So not a lot of potty breaks on days<br />you were in the Spider-Man garb?
4232020 4233313 No.
4234398 4236775 But I think it's...<br />I mean, we went through...
4236942 4241655 I went through, like, 30 different<br />fittings and I went through...
4242989 4247494 You know, where they cast my body,<br />which was very uncomfortable...
4247661 4253125 ...because the guys who did it<br />did not tell me that the plaster cast...
4253291 4256169 ...would rip hairs out of my body.
4256336 4259840 Sounds like you got a plaster cast and<br />a free body-waxing at the same time.
4260006 4264344 It was fabulous. And it was<br />some of the most excruciating pain...
4264511 4266138 ...I've ever been through.
4266304 4268723 See, and people think<br />it's all glamour and parties.
4268890 4274396 Then I had to stand nearly naked in<br />front of dozens of people all the time.
4274563 4277858 - They'd take photos, computer scans.<br />- Staring at the intricate details.
4278024 4279901 Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
4280861 4283488 Luckily I had been working out<br />for many months...
4283655 4287659 ...so, you know,<br />I was the newly buffed Tobey.
4289161 4292956 And then they played with<br />the different graphics on the suit.
4293290 4298712 Three-dimensional webbing versus<br />webbing that was just in the design.
4298879 4301506 And finally we came up with...
4301673 4305844 And face mask versus not<br />a face mask versus helmet, versus...
4306011 4309514 ...just the material. And it was<br />some kind of a spandex y material...
4309681 4310724 ...Lycra or something.
4311475 4314060 And it was pretty...
4315979 4322402 You know, it was pretty good<br />for movement. It was...
4322569 4326406 They designed it, because Spider-Man<br />is such an agile character...
4326573 4329451 ...so you could move around,<br />and do flips and run around.
4329618 4331286 - Right.<br />- You know.
4331453 4336166 It wasn't as bad as what I heard<br />that the Batman suit was.
4336333 4339085 - Apparently, that was...<br />- Not fun to move in?
4339252 4340670 Not fun, yeah.
4340837 4342923 This wasn't so bad.
4345967 4347677 He's hearing voices.
4347844 4349888 <i>Somebody.</i>
4351223 4352766 Who said that?
4353433 4356770 <i>Don't play the innocent with me.</i>
4359231 4361900 <i>You've known all along.</i>
4365904 4367280 Where are you?
4367447 4371576 <i>Follow the cold shiver<br />running down your spine.</i>
4371743 4374621 Willem would, like,<br />basically never be in his trailer.
4374788 4380460 He just always wanted to be in on<br />the action wandering around the set.
4380961 4383004 It was good to see.
4383171 4386091 He was so involved and invested.
4386258 4389844 And I really think<br />that's what makes this movie fly...
4390303 4392013 ...for me, is that...
4393598 4397644 ...people are trying to give real<br />performances within the comic book...
4397811 4400313 - ...fantasy world.<br />- Right.
4400480 4403650 To say what you won't. To do what...
4403858 4408029 Yeah, he's a hard-working guy,<br />pays a lot of attention to detail.
4409739 4412951 I read an article<br />that was interesting about...
4414035 4418415 You know, and I don't wanna...<br />I'm going to generalize a little...
4418582 4420250 ...but how younger actors...
4420625 4421626 We?
4422752 4425547 ...don't use their bodies<br />as much nowadays.
4425714 4429801 That it's a lot about head acting.
4432012 4434472 And it was theorizing that...
4435348 4438893 ...because people came out<br />of the theater much more...
4439060 4443690 ...years ago, whereas a lot of people<br />are just going straight into film...
4443857 4447527 Right, where it's all about close-ups<br />and subtlety, yeah.
4447694 4448862 In theater you're there.
4449029 4452532 Your whole body, people<br />are watching all of you all the time.
4452699 4456286 So I think that's why Willem's<br />such a great choice, is that...
4456453 4458788 ...he really physicalizes<br />his character.
4459664 4462334 That was pretty maniacal.
4462500 4464586 - The old Flatiron there.<br />- Yup.
4464753 4467881 - Here we are back there.<br />- Back in Los Angeles.
4468048 4471051 Yeah, back in Los Angeles-slash-L.A.-<br />-slash-New York.
4471217 4473178 We were in Manhattan<br />three shots ago.
4473345 4474721 Now we're in L.A.
4476640 4477807 How about "Green Meanie"?
4479184 4482062 Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.<br />That's slander.
4482228 4484564 It is not. I resent that.
4484898 4486566 No reasoning with J. Jonah.
4486733 4491279 Do you know what? I really love<br />what was done with your character.
4491446 4493990 I don't know where it came from,<br />exactly“.
4495742 4499412 ...but in this scene,<br />there's some real...
4499788 4503667 ...redemptive quality about J. Jonah<br />because he's kind of a hard-ass...
4503833 4507337 - ...and whatnot, but...<br />- That was very important to me.
4507504 4510590 Sam and I actually met a lot<br />during preproduction...
4510757 4513093 ...and talked about the script...
4514010 4516805 ...and trying not to make this guy<br />two-dimensional either.
4516971 4518765 Here he is risking his own life to...
4518932 4524521 He's protecting Peter Parker, which<br />I think is pretty courageous, you know.
4524688 4529818 He's like... Oh, he's not such<br />a bad guy, he's got some courage.
4531861 4536282 Yeah, he's just got a little burr under<br />his saddle about old Spider-Man.
4536449 4540620 In the comic books,<br />there was something about him.
4540787 4544541 He had, like, a big admission<br />where he says...
4545375 4548294 Someone was questioning him<br />or he has some confessional...
4548461 4551297 ...where he says<br />he doesn't like Spider-Man...
4551464 4556469 ...because Spider-Man is so altruistic<br />and it's unrealistic or something.
4556636 4560140 - And how can anybody be that good?<br />- Right.
4560306 4562809 And it made him<br />feel less about himself.
4562976 4565854 Right, exactly.<br />He's both suspicious and envious.
4566020 4567230 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.
4567397 4569774 You and I are not so different.
4570316 4572360 I'm not like you.
4572736 4575989 This was a good choice,<br />to be able to see...
4576156 4579033 - See the eyes.<br />- ...Willem's eyes in this outfit.
4579200 4583621 Well, and how to carry a film<br />and keep an audience interested...
4583788 4586082 ...in characters where<br />you can't see them ever?
4586249 4587292 Yeah, yeah.
4587459 4591296 And I thought the eyes were good,<br />to see Willem's eyes.
4591463 4595216 And Sam and I talked a lot about<br />how to keep people...
4595383 4598511 ...with Peter Parker<br />even when he was in the mask.
4599262 4604601 And, you know, it was challenging,<br />but I guess you just...
4605143 4610815 We tried to do it with physicality<br />and a little bit of dialogue.
4610982 4616446 Sometimes he talks to himself<br />to keep people involved.
4617197 4622368 But this is the villain<br />spouting his philosophies.
4622535 4625121 - The bad guy credo here.<br />- Yeah.
4625288 4630794 A little bit of the, like Darth Vader,<br />"Join me."
4632378 4635131 What we could create.
4635715 4640595 Kind of an antagonistic<br />buddy scene here.
4640970 4646976 That's, again, one of the admirable<br />qualities about Peter Parker, is that...
4647560 4650271 ...he doesn't... Not only does<br />he not go to the dark side...
4650438 4653525 ...in a big way, but he doesn't<br />take advantage of his abilities...
4653691 4658905 ...even in small ways for<br />his own gain, really, like he could.
4659072 4663368 Right. And I think that came out<br />of the wrestling situation...
4663535 4669457 ...when, you know,<br />vindictively he let that guy go...
4669624 4673920 ...and then felt responsible<br />for his uncle's death.
4675296 4677090 The responsibility.
4677257 4679259 Here we are on the backlot again.
4679425 4680927 - It's me again.<br />- Hey!
4681302 4682720 How was your audition?
4683638 4686099 I have a feeling it's gonna rain.
4686266 4688059 - You do?<br />- I could feel it in the air.
4688226 4689853 You know what?
4690687 4694274 I underst... My senses are tingling.
4694440 4697569 ...Took two buses and a cab<br />to get in the neighborhood, but...
4698695 4700196 So how'd it go?
4702282 4706911 Kirsten, she's so great because<br />she's so beautiful, but so real.
4707078 4709873 So beautiful in a<br />sort of unglamorous...
4710039 4714377 - ...actual girl next door, you know.<br />- Definitely.
4714544 4716129 Well, that's the thing.
4716296 4721134 She is gorgeous and sexy,<br />but not self-conscious at all.
4721301 4725763 Very confident and self-assured...
4725930 4728308 ...and, you know, isn't afraid.
4728474 4730894 Never mind.<br />That's none of my business.
4731394 4732896 It's not?
4734314 4735982 Why so interested?
4736649 4738151 I'm not.
4738401 4739777 You're not?
4740320 4744157 This is some of the most fun I had,<br />is doing my scenes with her.
4745116 4748661 She just gives you so much.<br />It's amazing because...
4748912 4750914 I'm trying to think. I think she was 18...
4751080 4755335 ...when we started the picture and<br />then turned 19 during production.
4755501 4758087 That's what amazing too.<br />She's been around for so long.
4758254 4761215 - Not unlike her co-star, actually.<br />- Right.
4761382 4765428 Somebody that has...<br />You know, when I was your age...
4765595 4768097 ...I think I was doing summer stock<br />in Montana.
4768264 4772393 But people like you and Kirsten,<br />who started at such a young age...
4772560 4775438 - I think she even younger than you.<br />- Yeah. I can't remember...
4775605 4778733 ...but 3, or 5, or 6,<br />somewhere really young.
4778900 4782695 - And I started when I was, like, 13.<br />- Yeah, you were an old guy.
4782862 4786115 - You were almost growed up.<br />- Yeah. That's right.
4790870 4795041 This is similar to the screen test<br />that I did.
4798836 4800296 Get off me!
4806552 4809222 Very professional stuntmen.<br />She was never in danger.
4809389 4811557 Although this was one<br />of her favorite scenes...
4811724 4814060 ...because she got to<br />kick some butt.
4829409 4832453 This is a fun shot here.<br />I had to run...
4832620 4836499 ...in here and I jumped up<br />in this little trapdoor they had.
4836666 4838292 Then they shut the door<br />behind me...
4838459 4841504 ...spin around,<br />and a double dropped down...
4841671 4842714 ...all in one shot.
4842880 4845800 Then it's me. And then they cut<br />and come in closer, and it's me.
4845967 4850304 And Kirsten... This is our<br />big kiss moment coming up.
4850471 4852724 The much talked about<br />upside-down kiss.
4852890 4854642 When we shot her<br />close-up coverage...
4854809 4856936 ...it was before...<br />I was actually standing...
4857103 4859272 ...right side up for part of it.
4861357 4864110 And she leans off camera...
4864777 4866404 ...when he comes up.
4866571 4870366 And she planted one on me.
4871117 4873953 - It really is a tough business, isn't it?<br />- Yeah, it was tough.
4874120 4875872 I will say<br />that was the enjoyable one.
4876039 4879375 When I was actually upside down,<br />I couldn't breathe.
4880460 4883629 - Water was pouring down.<br />- See the veins popping out of his neck.
4883796 4886049 I mean, it couldn't have been<br />more uncomfortable.
4886215 4888718 I literally couldn't breathe.<br />I apologized to Kirsten:
4888885 4891429 "Listen, I'm gonna have to<br />suck air out of the side...
4891596 4895808 ...of our mouths."<br />Because right there...
4895975 4899228 ...the mask is rolled up<br />to my nose and the mask is wet...
4899395 4903566 ...so it's no longer breathable at all. I<br />could only breathe through my mouth...
4903733 4907528 ...and then I was kissing her,<br />so there was nowhere to breathe.
4907695 4911449 It was unbearable. And it was,<br />like, 4:30, 5 in the morning.
4911616 4912992 Of course, yeah.
4915161 4918498 - Good shot. Oh, yeah, definitely.<br />- Worth it though, great shot.
4918664 4920583 Absolutely.
4925004 4926339 Now, this is not the backlot.
4926506 4930676 No. And this was New York,<br />as well.
4935556 4940436 Yeah. Again, this is a scene that we've<br />seen versions of this a million times.
4940603 4944023 And maybe it's just because<br />I'm a dad now but, you know...
4944190 4948528 And I apologize for not knowing<br />this actress's name but she's...
4948694 4951531 ...a New York actress that,<br />you know, works all the time.
4951697 4954617 She's great. And I've seen her<br />in a couple other things too.
4954784 4957954 She's like one of those people,<br />you know.
4958121 4964127 You're in the business, you're privy<br />to watching people's careers grow.
4964293 4966379 And she was so good.
4966546 4969715 And then I saw her in<br />a couple other movies or TV shows...
4970007 4972593 ...I'm not sure what,<br />and I went, "Wow."
4972760 4975972 I bet she's gonna do<br />really, really well.
4978307 4979475 No!
4987191 4991195 - It's okay. Your baby's fine.<br />- Oh, my baby!
4992238 4995158 God bless you, Spider-Man.<br />Bless you.
4997076 4999579 - Spider-Man is wanted.<br />- Right.
5000246 5002874 A lot of these guys<br />that play New York's finest...
5003040 5005084 ...and/or New York's bravest...
5005251 5007920 ...in these movies<br />actually are New York cops...
5008087 5009881 ...or New York firefighters.
5011924 5013634 I don't know<br />either one of these guys.
5013801 5015928 - I don't know if they are.<br />- Yeah, I'm not sure.
5016095 5021726 But, yeah, we have a combination<br />of actors and the real deal.
5022059 5023769 Where are you?
5025813 5027398 Where are you?
5029525 5032820 Of course all of my dialogue<br />is looped.
5034447 5038784 That's a whole different challenge,<br />being in the recording studio...
5038951 5042788 ...five months later<br />and having to try and re-create...
5042955 5046125 ...the same level of involvement.
5046292 5050463 You're pathetically predictable.<br />Like a moth to the flame.
5050671 5054926 You end up doing that in just about<br />every movie you do, even if it's just...
5055092 5057428 ...sitting around a table talking,<br />there's always...
5057595 5060973 For one reason or another, there's<br />always some re-recording to do.
5061140 5064310 Yeah, you always do it,<br />but this was very heavy.
5064727 5066229 Oh, great.
5067939 5069315 Yeah.
5069815 5072151 This was a cool shot.
5073277 5075529 How'd you get your body<br />to do that in slow motion?
5075696 5077740 - You're amazing.<br />- Oh, thanks.
5077907 5080910 - Yeah, in all of that fire too.<br />- Yeah.
5086958 5088960 To be honest with you...
5089126 5093798 ...a lot of times in the movie, I can't<br />tell when it's me or a stuntman. I swear.
5094674 5096968 Because a lot of times,<br />we would both do things.
5097134 5098761 - Right.<br />- You know, because...
5100179 5102265 ...we wanted it to be me<br />and sometimes...
5102431 5106185 ...there were things I couldn't do<br />as well as the stuntman...
5106352 5108312 - ...and we would both try it.<br />- Yeah.
5110231 5113526 And at first, you know,<br />I would be all gung ho and say:
5113693 5115152 "I wanna do it! I wanna do it!"
5115319 5118447 And they would be...<br />You know, Sam and Laura...
5119657 5121534 ...would discourage me, you know:
5121701 5125371 "We don't really need you<br />to do this one and it's dangerous."
5125538 5128040 And by the end of the film<br />I was like:
5128207 5132295 - "No, just let him do it." You know?<br />- Yeah, "Bring in the double."
5132461 5135965 - Well, it was a long shoot for you.<br />- It was a very long shoot, yeah.
5138592 5142305 And I'll say, another person<br />behind the scenes...
5143514 5146225 ...who really cares<br />about the character...
5146976 5149395 ...and had a lot of great input<br />was Avi Arad...
5149562 5154233 ...who's the head of... I believe<br />he's the head of Marvel Entertainment.
5154400 5156861 I mean, I don't know his actual title.
5157570 5160323 But, you know, these characters<br />are his babies.
5160823 5166287 And he just did a fine job<br />working with everybody on this movie.
5166454 5170416 And he's gotta be one of the most<br />prolific producers in Hollywood now...
5170583 5173002 ...with all of his Marvel movies.<br />It's unbelievable.
5173169 5176505 And he's... The thing about Marvel...
5177006 5179091 ...characters...
5179925 5183095 ...is that they are relatable,<br />they are human. They're not...
5183262 5185681 ...you know, perfect heroes...
5185848 5188517 ...and just evil villains.
5188684 5190770 This was actually<br />one of the hardest stunts...
5190936 5192938 ...just being up on that wall.
5193105 5195775 As hard as that... On the ceiling.<br />As hard as that...
5195941 5198110 And bleeding, always a drag<br />when they cut you...
5198277 5200571 - ...and you have to bleed.<br />- Right, of course.
5200738 5204325 Then you gotta rehydrate and you can't<br />take a potty break because of the suit.
5221801 5225137 - Great shot here too.<br />- Yeah.
5229475 5232103 - Hey, everyone.<br />- Oh, Peter!
5232269 5235981 Sorry I'm late, it's a jungle out there.<br />I had to beat an old lady with a stick...
5236148 5239026 Yeah, now, was that in the script,<br />or was that...?
5239527 5243906 I can't remember. I think it might have<br />been something Sam came up with.
5244073 5248035 It was really loose. You know,<br />going into this film, I'm thinking...
5248202 5250287 ...you know, super big budget...
5251539 5253999 ...you know, potential franchise...
5254500 5258754 ...movie series for the studio.
5258921 5262842 It's gonna be really a lot of chefs<br />in the kitchen.
5263008 5269014 But they really gave us a tremendous<br />amount of freedom to play around.
5269181 5271016 That's what was great<br />about this film.
5271183 5275938 You know, I really went in going,<br />"Okay, be prepared for anything."
5276105 5279358 Because I hadn't done a film like this.<br />But it was the most freedom...
5279525 5281902 ...I think I'd had on any film...
5282069 5283529 ...which was pretty great.
5283696 5286949 I stepped off a curb and got clipped<br />by one of those bike messengers.
5287116 5288659 Well, let me see.
5288868 5290453 Oh, my goodness.
5290619 5294707 We discussed doing a Spidey-sense<br />moment here at the table.
5294874 5297710 But despite our budget,<br />we couldn't afford it.
5299628 5301380 That's the amazing thing<br />about movies.
5301547 5303883 No matter what the budget is,<br />it's never enough.
5304049 5305885 There's a top to it.
5306051 5311140 Whether you're on a 5-million-dollar...<br />I've been on $400,000 movies.
5311307 5315394 And this one that, you know, they<br />won't even tell you how much it cost.
5315561 5317271 And it's never enough.
5317438 5319732 - I've got to go.<br />- Why?
5320149 5323527 Something<br />has come to my attention.
5323736 5324987 Are you all right?
5325571 5331368 He has just discovered the identity<br />of Spider-Man.
5333037 5336582 I planned this so you'd meet M.J...
5336874 5339585 Well, I guess that's it, then.<br />Spider-Man's gonna be outed.
5339793 5341337 Yeah.
5341504 5344006 That's it. And here's...
5344590 5348177 ...Harry Osborn<br />getting a little insensitive too.
5349261 5354475 Yeah, it's hard to confront<br />the old dad figure too much here.
5354642 5357019 - Yeah.<br />- He sort of loses his backbone.
5357228 5358521 You're wrong about her, Dad.
5359021 5362191 A word to the not-so-wise<br />about your little girlfriend:
5362399 5365069 Do what you need to with her,<br />then broom her fast.
5376705 5379208 Thanks for sticking up for me,<br />Harry.
5379416 5382378 - You heard?<br />- Everyone heard that creep.
5382586 5386465 That creep is my father.<br />With luck, I'll be half of what he is.
5386715 5389051 Shut up about stuff<br />you don't understand!
5389218 5390886 Harry Osborn!
5391971 5394014 I'm sorry, Aunt May.
5396976 5400312 <i>Spider-Man is all but invincible.</i>
5400479 5403649 <i>But Parker, we can destroy him.</i>
5403816 5408279 Getting advice from himself.<br />"Attack the heart."
5408571 5410823 <i>Parker must be educated.</i>
5412992 5414285 What do I do?
5414827 5419415 I think it's the merging of<br />the characters within himself. He's...
5422042 5423335 Yes?
5423502 5428674 He's starting to accept his... The evil<br />side is his more dominant side now.
5428841 5432011 <i>...Warrior attacks<br />neither body nor mind.</i>
5432344 5433512 Tell me how!
5433679 5435848 <i>The heart, Osborn.</i>
5436098 5439143 <i>First, we attack his heart.</i>
5442938 5445190 In this scene, Aunt May.
5445357 5447735 ...And forgive us our trespasses...
5448569 5452740 Yeah, it's a great... The characters,<br />both Aunt May and Uncle Ben have...
5452906 5456368 ...a great combination<br />of wisdom and innocence.
5456535 5457953 Yeah, absolutely.
5458787 5462249 And Uncle Ben is really kept alive...
5463208 5468255 ...throughout the movie and throughout<br />the comic books he was too.
5473594 5475763 Two milligrams IV.
5477556 5478807 Get the BP.
5479224 5482811 Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?<br />What happened?
5483020 5484355 You have to leave.
5484521 5486231 - What happened?<br />- Those eyes!
5486440 5490486 Those horrible yellow eyes!
5495324 5497868 He knows who I am.
5499620 5501789 Peter gets caught up.
5507419 5511590 Feeling responsible once again<br />for a loved one.
5511757 5515761 That was a great little shot there<br />of you actually saying the line:
5515928 5518472 "He knows who I am."<br />Because it was so important...
5518639 5521767 ...to make that... Most people probably<br />would have understood that...
5521934 5525604 ...with just what you were doing<br />with your face...
5525771 5529900 ...but I'm sure Sam felt it was<br />important to make it very clear.
5530067 5533987 And it was good, I think,<br />not to bring back in the voice-over...
5534154 5536156 ...idea too much<br />throughout the movie.
5536323 5538951 To just use that<br />as a kind of a bookend device.
5539118 5545416 Yeah. There was a lot of discussion<br />about when Peter should realize...
5546792 5552089 ...that Norman figured it out.
5553424 5556176 - Thanks for coming.<br />- Of course.
5560347 5563267 How are you?<br />You okay about the other night?
5563434 5567104 Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad<br />about leaving Aunt May.
5567354 5570315 - Have you talked to Harry?<br />- He called me.
5570774 5572943 I haven't called him back.
5575320 5579658 Yeah, and here again in the middle of<br />this quote-unquote action movie...
5579825 5584246 ...you know, we have a really nice<br />extended scene here...
5586957 5589334 ...about the characters...
5589752 5592671 ...and what's going on in their lives.
5592838 5595591 There's so many different...
5596133 5597384 It's funny.
5597551 5599803 ...you know...
5599970 5602765 ...stories going on within this.
5602931 5608687 And it's actually a pretty complex,<br />epic sort of film.
5610272 5613567 But do you think it's true, all the<br />terrible things they say about him?
5613734 5617070 That nice little shot of Aunt May<br />actually being awake now.
5617237 5619782 - Yeah, eavesdropping.<br />- Listening in to the whole thing.
5619948 5622409 I'm sort of his unofficial<br />photographer.
5622701 5624745 Which would be kind of skeevy...
5624953 5627664 ...if it wasn't somebody<br />as sweet as Aunt May.
5629416 5630501 Here's...
5632211 5637549 ...Peter getting himself<br />in a little bit of a pickle. Going into...
5637716 5640135 Speaking in third person<br />of his alter ego.
5640302 5645015 This is really one of the great romantic<br />little speeches here, though.
5645182 5646934 - It's really nice.<br />- Yeah, it was nice.
5647100 5648936 We did a lot of work on the dialogue.
5649102 5651730 It was very...
5652397 5654066 ...tricky.
5656443 5659655 ...And she's looking back in yours...
5660155 5662658 There it is. When you have...
5663158 5667120 ...someone great to work with like<br />Kirsten, it makes it so much easier.
5667287 5669706 Right. Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's...
5669873 5673085 You're doing all the talking,<br />but it's so much a two-person scene.
5673252 5675796 - Yeah. Yeah.<br />- She contributes so much to it.
5675963 5680300 You can see her, like, progressively<br />opening and getting touched.
5680467 5682219 And then that...
5683554 5686932 ...feeds me and informs my stuff.
5687766 5692062 The truth is, you don't know<br />what you feel...
5693480 5697109 ...except you know what kind of man<br />you want to be.
5699820 5701697 It's as if you've...
5702322 5705492 ...reached the unreachable...
5707077 5709788 ...and you weren't ready for it."
5713250 5715002 You said that?
5715794 5718130 Well, something like that.
5718797 5720465 There's the little comic relief.
5720632 5724428 Yeah, little backpedal. "Yeah, you<br />know, something like that. Whatever."
5727723 5731476 It's great working with actors too,<br />and it's not always the case, where...
5731643 5735147 Obviously, when this scene is shot,<br />they point the camera on you...
5735314 5738150 ...and do the whole scene,<br />then they turn everything around...
5738317 5741653 ...take their four hours to light it,<br />and they point the camera on her.
5742613 5744489 But often times,<br />or at least sometimes...
5744656 5747743 ...you work with other actors who,<br />when the camera's not on them...
5747910 5750787 ...they kind of show up<br />and sit there and aren't really...
5750954 5753874 ...contributing much<br />to what you're doing.
5754041 5757711 But it's obvious that you guys<br />were working for each other a lot.
5757878 5760797 Well, I've heard a lot of stories<br />about that kind of thing.
5760964 5765636 And I've been fortunate enough not to<br />have had to experience it too much.
5767262 5772184 Yeah, it's not... I mean, only<br />a few times that I've felt that way...
5772351 5774978 ...about another actor.
5776521 5778607 Nobody in this movie.
5778774 5780442 No.
5781652 5783445 Well, you were right about M.J.
5783737 5786531 - Except for maybe Ted Raimi.<br />- Yeah, that guy. I don't know.
5786698 5788575 - How did he get the job?<br />- I don't know.
5788742 5792496 - What was the deal there?<br />- It was just a good audition, I think.
5792663 5794623 And how does he feel about her?
5797209 5799753 He's loved her since the 4th grade.
5800712 5805968 He pretends like he doesn't, but<br />there's no one Peter cares for more.
5807427 5811223 A little bonding moment<br />for father and son.
5811390 5812891 Yeah, they keep trying.
5813058 5816019 I haven't always been there for you,<br />Havel?
5818313 5821525 You're busy. You're an important man.<br />I understand.
5821733 5823527 That's no excuse.
5824528 5826321 I'm proud of you.
5826863 5831743 I've lost sight of that somewhere.<br />But I'll make it up to you.
5831910 5835247 I'm going to rectify<br />certain inequities.
5849302 5851096 <i>Wake up, little spider.</i>
5851263 5852764 Wake up.
5854099 5855684 Go home, dear.
5855892 5857227 You look awful.
5857436 5859730 - And you look beautiful.<br />- Well, thank you.
5859938 5863233 - I don't like to leave you here.<br />- But I'm safe here.
5863400 5866111 - Can I do anything for you?<br />- You do too much.
5866278 5871825 College, a job, all this time with me.<br />You're not Superman, you know.
5872576 5874327 A smile. Finally.
5874494 5877748 Haven't seen one of those on<br />your face since Mary Jane was here.
5877914 5881293 Hey.<br />You were supposed to be asleep.
5882085 5886882 You know, you were about 6 years old<br />when M.J.'s family moved in next door.
5887090 5891053 And when she got out of the car,<br />and you saw her for the first time...
5891219 5894639 It reminded me when she said<br />"you're not Superman" of the trailer.
5894806 5899311 I think the people who cut the trailer<br />in the Marketing Department...
5899478 5903440 ...did such a good job, because<br />obviously the awareness was...
5903607 5905358 ...very high.
5905525 5909154 But they also did a good job<br />of not giving away the entire movie.
5909321 5912616 Yes, which is a real pet peeve of mine.<br />It was a really good trailer.
5912783 5916578 - It was a good trailer.<br />- It gave you a real sense of it without...
5917204 5918914 Not giving away the whole thing, yeah.
5919081 5921833 Tell me, would it be so dangerous...
5922042 5926004 ...to let Mary Jane know<br />how much you care?
5926421 5928924 Everybody else knows.
5931968 5933220 I'll be right back.
5933887 5935180 But...
5942521 5944523 Come on, pick up.
5944689 5947984 <i>- Hey, M.J...<br />- Sing your song at the beep.</i>
5949069 5950737 By the machine.
5951363 5954199 Hello? You there?
5954699 5959204 I'm just calling to check up on you.<br />Will you call me when you get in?
5959371 5960789 All right, well...
5960956 5962249 Don't...
5963041 5965252 Don't go up any dark alleys.
5965460 5966962 Hello?
5969381 5973093 <i>Can Spider-Man come out to play?</i>
5973301 5975053 Where is she?
5980976 5984062 Well, she's on top<br />of the Brooklyn Bridge.
5993071 5996324 Was it the Brooklyn Bridge?
5996992 5999369 I think so.<br />Now, a lot of this was done...
5999536 6001746 ...on the sound stage<br />or in green screen...
6001913 6006084 - ...but you did some on location too?<br />- Yes. Yeah.
6019931 6023935 If that's the tram, I guess it's probably<br />the 59th Street Bridge, isn't it?
6024102 6027355 I don't think it's the Brooklyn Bridge.<br />Is there a Queensboro Bridge?
6027522 6029816 The Queensboro Bridge<br />is the 59th Street Bridge.
6029983 6031568 There you go.
6043872 6045957 This is a very cruel choice...
6046124 6050629 ...that the Goblin<br />proposes to Spider-Man.
6052130 6053965 In a moment.
6056134 6059638 Now, this whole sequence<br />is so complicated with...
6059804 6062724 ...you know, sound stage,<br />green screen...
6062891 6065852 ...shooting it<br />on actually the location...
6066019 6069814 ...and then the animation.
6077280 6079783 Yeah, filmmaking has changed<br />and evolved a little bit.
6079950 6082077 It's not pointing<br />the camera at actors anymore.
6082244 6083578 No.
6093004 6094673 Yeah, this was great.
6094839 6099010 Contrast that with the first sequence<br />where he's chasing the carjacker...
6099177 6102180 ...and trying to get a handle<br />on his abilities...
6102347 6104933 ...and now he's completely<br />in command.
6105100 6107686 Let die the woman you love...
6112065 6117153 ...or suffer the little children.
6117779 6119197 Kirsten...
6119364 6121700 You know, Sam asked Kirsten,<br />he said:
6121866 6123868 "There's a lot of stunts and wire work.
6124035 6126788 And are you in shape and prepared...
6126955 6130625 ...to do this and get beat up a little?"<br />She was like, "Yeah. No problem."
6130792 6133461 And I'm thinking, "Come on,<br />I'm playing Spider-Man.
6133628 6135672 What does this girl gotta do?"<br />You know?
6135839 6139009 And I think that she probably...
6139634 6142554 ...had to do as much, if not more.<br />I love that shot.
6142721 6144514 - Yeah. Yeah.<br />- So cool.
6144681 6146558 She had to do as much,<br />if not more...
6149060 6151104 ...stunt stuff...
6151271 6154024 ...stunt work than I did.
6164326 6167871 This was a bit<br />of an excruciating sequence.
6168246 6171875 We're on a sound stage,<br />hanging from wires all day long.
6172042 6174919 - Holding a 6-inch ram in one arm.<br />- Yeah, of course.
6175086 6176796 - Right.<br />- That'll wear you out.
6176963 6179924 The secret there<br />is the core strength.
6180842 6183762 We're gonna bring the barge<br />right under you.
6191269 6195398 - He's coming back!<br />- Listen. I need you to climb down.
6195565 6197067 - I can't.<br />- Yes, you can!
6202155 6205200 M.J., you can do it. You have to.
6205367 6206951 Trust me.
6207619 6212207 That's another real acting challenge.<br />You know, we were talking about...
6212374 6215126 ...the whole crying scene,<br />emotional scenes.
6215293 6218338 You know, to do this<br />damsel-in-distress thing...
6218505 6223176 ...you know, that Kirsten does here<br />and maintain that level of panic...
6224302 6227305 ...you know, for what<br />I'm sure was a few days...
6227472 6229849 - ...of shooting this sequence.<br />- Oh, yeah.
6230016 6235647 Then also at Times Square on the<br />balcony, she had to do all that stuff.
6239401 6241986 That's another great shot here.
6248993 6251621 - He's not gonna make it.<br />- He's gonna make it!
6253832 6256543 We had all the people...
6257335 6261172 ...doubting Spider-Man<br />with J. Jonah's...
6262424 6263925 - ...headlines.<br />- Right.
6264092 6267470 You know, they're not sure where<br />Spider-Man's coming from, if he's...
6268596 6270432 ...a good guy or a bad guy.
6271558 6273768 That really always continues<br />to be the story...
6273935 6275603 ...of Peter Parker and Spider-Man.
6275770 6279858 He's never universally acclaimed<br />like Superman...
6280024 6282861 ...or some other superheroes.<br />There's always...
6283486 6285947 ...a significant group of people that...
6286739 6289951 But here's a moment<br />where he gets some support...
6290118 6294289 ...which is encouragement for him<br />that he's on the right path.
6294456 6296833 Because it makes<br />him question himself earlier.
6299544 6301337 Spider-Man, watch out!
6307760 6311222 - But the moment of victory is short.<br />- Yeah.
6317479 6320440 Now, this is the sequence<br />where I got beat up the most.
6320607 6321858 Yeah, this...
6323401 6326404 That's a cool effect.
6332327 6336748 This is where Willem was not<br />entirely pulling his punches...
6336915 6338082 ...coming up here.
6338875 6342378 When did you shoot this? Toward the<br />end that you shot this sequence or...?
6343213 6347091 We came back to it a couple times,<br />but I do believe it was towards the end.
6347759 6351304 And it was really dusty<br />and smoky and...
6351471 6354933 As you see, they had to put lots<br />of blood and sweat all over me...
6355099 6357101 ...and I'm in the suit. And dirt.
6357268 6359395 Yeah, that's another element<br />that adds to...
6361272 6363107 - ...a long day.<br />- Yeah.
6363274 6365193 Then I had to get beat up a lot.
6368112 6371282 Then I'd have to go back and do<br />looping and make all these little...
6373618 6377121 ...noises. Try to vary<br />the grunts and efforts.
6379624 6384254 And that right there is where I got<br />some nice little bruises on my ribs.
6385171 6388132 I had to throw myself into bricks.
6388299 6391135 Many times.
6395723 6397809 He might be done for.
6398476 6400812 Yup. No sequels.
6401479 6403314 Spider-Man's gonna buy it.
6403481 6406776 But now that you've really<br />pissed me off...
6407485 6410196 He makes the mistake...
6410572 6413992 ...talking about torturing<br />the woman he loves.
6416452 6418496 M.J. and I...
6419330 6422625 ...we're gonna have a hell of a time.
6424002 6427797 In classic WWF style.<br />Just when you thought he was down.
6429007 6430842 Don't count him out.
6431009 6432510 An extra reserve.
6438308 6442186 It's great that you both have your eyes<br />to work with in this sequence too.
6442353 6443855 Yeah.
6476429 6477972 Peter, stop!
6478139 6480600 Stop! It's me.
6489567 6490985 Mr. Osborn.
6491194 6492779 Peter, thank God for you.
6492987 6495281 You killed those people<br />on that balcony.
6495490 6498534 The Goblin killed!<br />I had nothing to do with it!
6498701 6501913 Don't let him take me again.<br />I beg you. Protect me.
6502163 6503289 Don't trust him.
6503456 6506292 You tried to kill Aunt May.<br />You tried to kill Mary Jane.
6506584 6508086 But not you.
6509212 6512965 This is great, because as an audience,<br />you're going back and forth here.
6513132 6515343 Oh, now you know.<br />He's definitely, you know...
6515510 6521683 - Right.<br />- ...still in the Mr. Hyde persona.
6522934 6525645 It's fully taken him.
6526688 6528523 Thank God for you.
6529524 6530942 Give me your hand.
6532110 6535530 Believe in me<br />as I believed in you.
6536948 6539742 I've been like a father to you.
6541285 6542954 Be a son to me now.
6543955 6546416 Uncle Ben lives.
6547375 6549877 His name was Ben Parker.
6551754 6553214 Godspeed, Spider-Man.
6555883 6557969 Thank God for that Spidey-sense.
6571649 6572692 Peter...
6572900 6575611 - That's gonna leave a mark.<br />- Yeah.
6575987 6577280 Don't tell Harry.
6578156 6582577 That's a nice moment<br />before he dies.
6582744 6585496 "Don't tell Harry." He does care.
6593004 6596090 - Spidey misunderstood once again.<br />- Right.
6596257 6599343 He's trying to do a good deed...
6599510 6606100 ...hiding the Green Goblin alter ego.
6606976 6613691 Harry sees Spider-Man and thinks<br />he's responsible for his father's death.
6636255 6637757 Hey-
6641135 6643179 I'm so sorry, Harry.
6644096 6647225 I know what it's like<br />to lose a father.
6650353 6652605 Now, was this shot in the fall?
6654899 6657902 No. It was...
6658069 6660530 I swear on my father's grave,<br />Spider-Man will pay.
6660738 6662740 I'm gonna say it was...
6664575 6667662 ...early spring in New York.
6669121 6671582 You're the only family I have.
6677922 6679590 Maybe late winter.
6685096 6688683 A little extra guilt for Peter Parker.
6688850 6693145 And a little suggestion<br />of what may be to come...
6693312 6695773 ...for Harry's character.
6696107 6698401 <i>No matter what I</i> do...
6698568 6701696 <i>...no matter how hard I try...</i>
6702280 6706117 <i>...the ones I love will always<br />be the ones who pay.</i>
6718045 6720923 So they're gonna live<br />happily ever after, right?
6721090 6723134 Yes, finally. After...
6723301 6726512 Have a big kiss and<br />they'll walk off hand in hand.
6726971 6728931 As any big...
6730099 6732560 ...superhero Hollywood movie<br />should be...
6732727 6735104 ...there should<br />be a happy ending, right?
6736355 6740484 Finally, after all this time.
6740651 6743321 All these challenges...
6743487 6745281 ...tragedy...
6747575 6749911 ...Peter Parker gets<br />what he wants most.
6750828 6752705 I kept thinking:
6753664 6757627 The true caring and love<br />of Mary Jane Watson.
6757793 6760004 Yeah, sorry. Not gonna happen.
6763090 6766260 For the first time in movie history...
6766427 6769180 ...I get to say no to a girl.
6772058 6774018 ...Who makes me feel...
6774477 6778189 ...like I'm more than I ever<br />thought I could be.
6780316 6781984 That I'm just...
6782652 6784153 ...me.
6785237 6787156 And that's okay.
6789325 6790826 The truth is...
6791869 6796707 This is a great arc for her character,<br />that she's really...
6796874 6801212 ...grown up and settled into herself,<br />and learned what's important...
6801379 6803839 ...and set her priorities straight...
6806801 6809971 ...though she had to<br />go through a lot to get there.
6813891 6815393 Peter is tortured.
6819563 6823526 <i>All I wanted was to tell her<br />how much I loved her.</i>
6823734 6825695 Intoxicated.
6828489 6830032 You can't what?
6831158 6832618 Tell you...
6834328 6838582 ...everything.<br />I mean, there's so much to tell.
6839917 6842211 One of those tough scenes,<br />there's so much wind...
6842378 6843921 ...I had to loop the whole thing.
6844088 6846340 - Oh, really?<br />- Yeah.
6846966 6849635 ...That I will always be there<br />for you.
6849844 6853806 I will always be there<br />to take care of you.
6854807 6856809 I promise you that.
6860104 6862398 I will always be your friend.
6865317 6867194 Only a friend...
6868070 6869613 ...Peter Parker?
6871782 6874618 That's all I have to give.
6886464 6888632 People had really emotional<br />reactions to this.
6888799 6891969 They'd get pissed off like,<br />"Why? What happened?
6892136 6895306 I don't understand.<br />Why didn't they get together?"
6895473 6897767 It's pretty emotionally mature...
6898893 6902688 ...of Peter there, even though<br />it might be a little extreme.
6902855 6905733 Well, that's as close<br />as he comes to... You know...
6905900 6908194 ...it's still very real,<br />but it's very noble.
6908360 6912406 - Yeah.<br />- Very self-sacrificing.
6913574 6915910 "It is my curse."
6917161 6919080 <i>Who am I?</i>
6919455 6920831 <i>I'm Spider-Man.</i>
6921832 6924418 Oh, you're Spider-Man?
6924585 6928464 And she touched her lips there,<br />like maybe she...
6928631 6931759 - Right. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />- Maybe she knows something.
6931926 6935930 I think we wanted to leave it<br />ambiguous, like...
6936097 6938641 Something was...
6938808 6941852 - We're not sure if she knew or not.<br />- Yeah.
6942019 6944563 This is one of the coolest...
6945689 6949944 - ...sequences, I think. What a shot.<br />- Yeah.
6950861 6955366 All in all, I'm gonna say<br />it was pretty cool to play Spider-Man.
6955533 6958953 - It was kind of a fun movie.<br />- It was fun.
6959120 6961705 A lot of work, but a lot of fun.
6962915 6966836 And seeing it again,<br />which I haven't in a little while...
6967002 6970714 ...getting a little nostalgic<br />and looking forward...
6971674 6974093 - ...to revving the engine back up...<br />- Yeah, yeah.
6974260 6976554 ...next year. Going back to work.
6976720 6979306 Back into training and...
6979890 6982351 There's Lucy Lawless.<br />Punk-rock girl, Lucy Lawless.
6982518 6984019 Oh, yeah.
6986188 6988232 The stunt guys did such a great job.
6988399 6992278 I mean, I was literally putting my life<br />in these guys' hands...
6992444 6997366 ...because they do all the wire rigging<br />and I'd be hanging 100 feet in the air.
6997533 7002454 And if they screwed up, you know,<br />I could be seriously injured or die.
7002621 7008377 Yeah, it was nice to have confidence<br />in those guys too.
7008544 7014258 Actually, for two days I was strung up<br />on one of those rigs...
7014425 7018762 - ...just in the set there. Yeah, yeah.<br />- In the office with the Goblin, yeah.
7022558 7026353 Well, there you have it.<br />Are you off back to New York?
7026520 7027938 I am indeed.
7028105 7031984 And maybe J. Jonah Jameson<br />will get...
7032151 7035112 ...some New York exterior scenes<br />in the sequel so I can...
7035279 7036947 That'd be nice. We should call Sam.
7037114 7039950 ...ride my bike to work<br />instead of flying out to L.A.
7040117 7044788 I would like to spend<br />some more time in Manhattan.
7045289 7048209 Yeah, well let's talk<br />to Laura and Sam.
7048375 7050419 - Perfect.<br />- See what we can figure out.
7050586 7054215 You know, now that<br />we're in a successful franchise...
7054381 7058594 ...maybe we can yield some<br />of our weight around and...
7061263 7067144 Well, thank you guys for<br />hearing us talk about our movie.
