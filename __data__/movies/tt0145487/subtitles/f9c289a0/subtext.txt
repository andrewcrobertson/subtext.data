191483 194736 <i>The story of my life<br />is not for the faint of heart.</i>
194903 197531 <i>If somebody said<br />it was a happy little tale...</i>
197739 202202 <i>...if somebody told you I was just your<br />average guy, not a care in the world...</i>
202369 204162 <i>...somebody lied.</i>
205038 208625 <i>But let me assure you, this,<br />like any story worth telling...</i>
208792 210210 <i>...is all about a girl.</i>
211086 215549 <i>That girl. The girl next door.<br />Mary Jane Watson.</i>
215716 218802 <i>The woman I've loved<br />since before I even liked girls.</i>
218969 221638 <i>I'd like to tell you that's me<br />next to her.</i>
221805 223807 <i>Aw, heck, I'd even take him.</i>
225225 227728 Hey! Stop the bus!
228729 229929 <i>That's me.</i>
230105 231982 Tell him to stop! Please!
232190 233400 Stop!
233608 235819 Hey! Stop the bus!
235986 239072 Stop! He's been chasing us<br />since Woodhaven Boulevard.
239239 240490 Catch a cab, Parker!
244953 247748 Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.
253170 254463 What a geek!
255130 259342 - Don't even think about it.<br />- You're so lame, Parker.
259509 261094 Would you date him?
278987 281198 Midtown High seniors.
281364 285076 No wandering. Proceed direct...<br />Knock it off.
285368 288830 Remember, it is a privilege<br />to be here.
289206 292459 We're guests of Columbia University's<br />Science Department.
292667 294878 So behave accordingly.
295045 298089 Let's not have a repeat<br />of our trip to the planetarium.
298298 299925 Come on, people, stay together.
300091 303011 Proceed up the steps<br />and into the building.
304179 307224 - Where were you?<br />- Checking out the library.
307390 309935 - Looking at the books.<br />- Yeah, right.
311686 314064 Charles, can we drive<br />around the corner, please?
314231 315524 Why?
315732 317526 The entrance is right there.
317692 321404 Dad, these are public-school kids.<br />I'm not showing up in the Rolls.
321571 323907 What, you want me<br />to trade in my car for a Jetta...
324074 327077 ...because you flunked out<br />of every private school I sent you to?
327244 330247 - It wasn't for me.<br />- Of course it was.
330747 332582 Don't ever be ashamed<br />of who you are.
332749 335252 I'm not ashamed of who I am.
335460 336753 It's just...
336920 338380 Just what, Harry?
338588 340090 Forget it.
343093 344427 Pete!
344845 346513 - Hi, Harry.<br />- Hey, man. What's up?
346680 348056 Harry.
348223 350433 - Won't you be needing this?<br />- Thanks, Dad.
351393 353770 Peter, may I introduce my father,<br />Norman Osborn.
353937 355355 I've heard so much about you.
355522 359025 - Great honour to meet you, sir.<br />- Harry says you're a science whiz.
359276 362112 You know,<br />I'm something of a scientist myself.
362279 365448 I read all your research<br />on nanotechnology. Really brilliant.
365615 368660 - And you understood it?<br />- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
368869 372122 Impressive.<br />Your parents must be very proud.
372289 374124 I live with my aunt and uncle.<br />They are.
374291 376877 Hey, you two! Let's move!
377043 380714 - Nice to meet you.<br />- Hope to see you again.
383049 386553 - He doesn't seem so bad.<br />- Not if you're a genius.
386720 388680 I think he wants to adopt you.
388847 393560 There are over 32,000 known species<br />of spider in the world.
393768 397564 They're in the order Araneae,<br />divided into three suborders.
397772 398972 That's amazing!
399024 402944 This is the most advanced electron<br />microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.
403278 405322 It's unreal.
405488 408283 Arachnids from all three<br />groups possess...
408491 411745 ...varying strengths to help them<br />search for food.
412037 416416 For example, the Delena spider,<br />family Sparassidae...
416583 420754 ...has the ability to jump<br />to catch its prey.
420921 422672 For the school paper?
427177 432182 Next, we have the net web spider,<br />family Filistatidae...
432390 434267 ...genus Kukulcania.
434517 438855 Spins a funnel-shaped web whose<br />strands have a tensile strength...
439022 444319 ...proportionately equal to the<br />high-tension wires used in bridges.
444778 446446 - Leave him alone.<br />- Or what?
446613 449616 Or his father will fire your father.
450033 452369 What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?
452535 455038 What is going on?
455205 458291 The next person who talks<br />will fail this course. I kid you not.
458500 460502 - This spider...<br />- Let's go.
460669 464839 ...hunts using reflexes with<br />nerve-conduction velocity so fast...
465048 468551 ...that some researchers believe<br />it borders on precognition.
468718 470887 - An early awareness of danger.<br />- Jerks.
471054 472847 A spider-sense.
473473 475141 Hey, look at that spider.
475308 479729 Some spiders change colours<br />to blend into their environment.
479980 481898 It's a defence mechanism.
482065 485360 Peter, what makes you think<br />I would want to know that?
485527 486736 Who wouldn't?
486903 490740 Over five painstaking years,<br />Columbia's genetic research facility...
490907 495286 - You gonna talk to her now?<br />- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.
495495 497414 Armed with these DNA blueprints...
497580 500250 ...we have now begun<br />what was once thought impossible.
500458 504129 - Disgusting.<br />- Yeah, hateful little things.
504337 505714 I love them!
506256 507924 Yeah, me too.
508883 512762 You know, spiders can change<br />their colour...
512929 516766 - ...to blend into their environment.<br />- Really?
516933 521146 - Yeah, it's a defence mechanism.<br />- Cool.
521312 524649 ...Transfer RNA<br />to encode an entirely new genome...
524816 527944 ...combining the genetic<br />information from all three spiders...
528111 532782 ...into these 15 genetically<br />designed super-spiders.
532949 534451 There's 14.
534909 536286 I beg your pardon?
536453 538997 - One's missing.<br />- Yeah.
541916 544544 I guess the researchers<br />are working on that one.
545045 548381 Do you know that this is the largest<br />electron microscope...
548548 549799 ...on the Eastern Seaboard?
549966 554012 You were talking throughout<br />that woman's entire presentation.
554179 555930 Let's go talk about how we listen.
560018 564105 Now, I don't know what it's like<br />at those fancy private schools...
564314 566191 ...but at Midtown High...
574657 578411 Could I take your picture?<br />I need one with a student in it.
578578 580163 - Sure.<br />- Great.
580330 582540 Where do you want me? Over here?
582749 584084 Yeah, that's great.
584501 586169 Don't make me look ugly.
586544 588379 That's impossible.
595637 596888 Perfect.
604646 606189 - Is that good?<br />- Great.
611736 613113 That's great.
618701 620703 M.J., let's go!
622247 624833 Wait. Thanks!
638304 641057 Parker, let's do it.
657782 661244 We solved the horizon glide<br />and the multi-G balance issues.
661411 663955 I've already seen the glider.
664372 666416 That's not what I'm here for.
666624 669294 General Slocum,<br />good to see you again.
670128 672297 Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.
672547 674382 - Norman.<br />- Mr. Osborn.
674549 678094 Always a pleasure to have<br />our board of directors visit.
678303 681723 I want to see the progress report<br />on human performance enhancers.
681890 686394 We tried vapour inhalation with rats.<br />Their strength increased by 800%.
686561 688438 - Excellent.<br />- Any side effects?
688605 689805 In one trial, yes.
689856 692525 An aberration. All the tests since<br />have been successful.
692692 696446 In the trial that went wrong,<br />what were the side effects?
696613 698948 Violence, aggression...
699616 700867 ...and insanity.
701034 703786 - What do you recommend?<br />- That was only one test.
704037 707874 Except for Dr. Stromm, our entire<br />staff certifies the product...
708041 710960 - ...ready for human testing.<br />- Dr. Stromm?
712295 715965 We need to take the whole line<br />back to formula.
717217 719636 - Back to formula?<br />- Dr. Osborn.
720803 722639 I'll be frank with you.
722889 727727 I never supported your programme. We<br />have my predecessor to thank for that.
727894 730647 The general has approved<br />Quest Aerospace...
730813 733733 ...to build a prototype<br />of their exoskeleton design.
734067 737654 - They test in two weeks.<br />- And if your performance enhancers...
737820 742242 ...have not had a successful<br />human trial by that date...
742492 746871 ...I'm gonna pull your funding.<br />I'm going to give it to them.
748665 750333 Gentlemen. Ladies.
755421 760843 And the Lord said, "Let there be light."<br />And voile! There is light.
761094 763179 Forty soft, glowing watts of it.
763346 768184 Good boy. God will be thrilled.<br />Just don't fall on your ass.
768518 770937 I'm already on my ass, May.
771104 775608 When the plant's senior electrician<br />is laid off after 35 years...
775775 778486 ...what else would you call it?<br />I am on my ass.
778695 781030 Hand me that dish. The green one.
781281 784033 The corporation is downsizing<br />the people...
784492 786369 ...and upsizing their profits.
786619 789539 Oh, Ben, you'll get another job<br />somewhere.
790581 793459 Well... Well, let's look<br />in the paper and see.
794585 797380 There are the want ads.<br />What do we got here?
797547 799173 Computer...
799382 803136 Computer salesman, computer<br />engineer, computer analyst.
803303 807056 My Lord, even the computers<br />need analysts these days.
807348 812645 I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and<br />besides, I have a family to provide for.
812854 815732 I love you. And Peter loves you.
815982 819235 You're the most responsible man<br />I've ever known.
819485 823906 We've been down-and-out before.<br />But somehow, we survive.
825033 829329 Hi, sweetie. You're just...<br />Just in time for dinner.
829537 832081 Hey. How you doing, buddy?<br />How was the field trip?
832248 835084 I don't feel well.<br />I'm gonna go to sleep.
835251 837754 - You won't have a bite?<br />- No thanks. Had a bite.
837920 840340 Did you get some pictures, Peter?
841174 844010 I gotta crash. Everything's fine.
845428 847013 What's that all about?
868284 870495 <i>In this recombination lab...</i>
870661 875291 <i>...we use synthesized transfer RNA<br />to encode an entirely new genome...</i>
875500 878544 <i>...combining the genetic<br />information from all three spiders...</i>
878753 883549 <i>...into these 15 genetically<br />designed super-spiders.</i>
898022 901984 Dr. Osborn, please. The<br />performance enhancers aren't ready.
902151 905488 The data just doesn't justify<br />this test.
905655 909325 Now, I'm asking you for the last time.<br />We can't do this.
909492 911702 Don't be a coward.
912161 914747 Risks are part of laboratory science.
914956 918668 Let me reschedule, with a proper<br />medical staff and a volunteer.
918876 922338 - Just give me two weeks.<br />- Two weeks? In two weeks...
922505 926008 ...we'll have lost the contract<br />to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.
926175 928928 Sometimes you gotta<br />do things yourself.
929095 931764 - Get me the Promachloraperazine.<br />- For what?
931931 935685 It begins catalyzation when the vapour<br />hits the bloodstream.
938604 940273 40,000 years of evolution...
940440 944193 ...and we've barely tapped<br />the vastness of human potential.
958040 959375 Oh, that's cold.
1018100 1019300 Norman?
1023606 1024899 Norman!
1026067 1027443 Norman!
1035618 1036953 Oh, my God.
1038454 1041582 Oh, my God! Norman?
1042250 1044377 Oh, my God! Norman!
1060518 1061978 Back to formula?
1097013 1098514 Weird.
1109442 1110818 - Peter?<br />- Yeah?
1111027 1112778 Are you all right?
1114697 1116324 I'm fine.
1116866 1118743 Any better this morning?<br />Any change?
1118909 1120286 Change?
1121287 1123205 Yep. Big change.
1123372 1127376 - Well, hurry up. You'll be late.<br />- Right.
1145770 1147146 Okay.
1151192 1155655 - Goodness me!<br />- Jeez. I thought you were sick.
1156197 1157531 - I got better.<br />- You see?
1157698 1161077 - Bye, guys.<br />- Have you got your lunch money?
1161243 1164914 Hey, Michelangelo, don't forget,<br />we're painting the kitchen after school.
1165081 1167875 Sure thing, Uncle Ben.<br />Don't start without me.
1168084 1170169 And don't start up with me.
1171462 1175424 Teenagers. Raging hormones.<br />They never change.
1176384 1180096 You're trash!<br />You're always gonna be trash!
1180262 1183849 - I have to go to school.<br />- Who's stopping you?
1201242 1202910 Hi, M.J.
1203786 1205287 Hey, M.J.
1205538 1210084 I don't know if you realise this, but<br />we've been neighbours since I was 6.
1210251 1213587 And I was wondering<br />if we could get together sometime?
1213796 1215339 I got the car. Hop in.
1215506 1218134 Do something fun?<br />Or, I don't know.
1218300 1221053 I thought it'd be time<br />to get to know each other.
1222430 1223681 Or not.
1229145 1231856 Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!
1233232 1235943 - Stop the bus!<br />- Catch a cab!
1236360 1237987 Tell him to stop.
1238654 1240656 - Check him out!<br />- Dork!
1263137 1264388 Dad!
1264847 1266724 Dad, are you all right?
1267558 1268851 Harry.
1272188 1274190 What are you doing on the floor?
1274356 1275691 I don't know.
1276525 1278861 Have you been there all night?
1280863 1282114 Last night I was...
1284450 1285701 What?
1286952 1288704 - I don't remember.<br />- Mr. Osborn?
1288871 1291248 Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.
1291415 1295795 - My father's not feeling well.<br />- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.
1295899 1297099 What?
1297129 1300716 They found his body in the lab.<br />He's been murdered, sir.
1300883 1304178 - What are you talking about?<br />- And the flight suit and the glider...
1304345 1306430 - What about it?<br />- It's been stolen, sir.
1331372 1334124 Wow! Great reflexes!
1335000 1337169 - Thanks.<br />- No problem.
1338254 1342174 Hey, you have blue eyes.<br />I didn't notice without your glasses.
1342925 1344593 You just get contacts?
1351350 1353519 Well, see you.
1395311 1398814 - What happened?<br />- He's freaking weird.
1399273 1400649 Did you see that?
1402234 1403903 Parker?
1435809 1438103 - It's a fight!<br />- Think you're pretty funny, freak?
1438270 1441315 - Flash, it was an accident.<br />- So is my breaking your teeth.
1441482 1444193 - Come on, Flash, stop.<br />- I don't wanna fight you, Flash.
1444360 1446820 - I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.<br />- Kick his ass.
1467049 1468249 Help him, Harry.
1473055 1474556 How'd he do that?
1475557 1476892 Which one?
1477059 1478435 He's all yours, man.
1493951 1495661 Flash, get up!
1497287 1500416 Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.
1501000 1503836 Peter, that was... That was amazing.
1504753 1506755 I'm out of here. Come on.
1611944 1613144 Go, web!
1614571 1616198 Fly.
1617783 1619868 Up, up and away, web.
1621370 1622871 Shazam!
1623372 1624706 Go! GO!
1624873 1626708 Go, web, go!
1659825 1661577 Tallyho.
1705495 1708123 - Is she back with the beer yet?<br />- What?
1708290 1709541 Bring me some beer.
1709750 1712294 - Get up off your ass.<br />- I paid for beer...
1712461 1713962 - Stop yelling.<br />- Stop it!
1714129 1716465 You're as stupid as your mother.<br />Get away from me!
1716632 1718217 You are drunk, do you know that?
1718383 1720928 Where's she going?<br />Where you going?
1722012 1725349 These dishes are not done.<br />Somebody's gotta do the dishes.
1725557 1728852 - Why don't you do them?<br />- Get in here and do the dishes.
1729061 1733190 - You do them. They're yours, anyway.<br />- I'm going out!
1733398 1735901 - Were you listening to that?<br />- No.
1736235 1739488 Well, I heard, but I was<br />just taking out the trash.
1739655 1742407 I guess you can always hear us.
1742574 1744868 Everybody shouts.
1745077 1746328 Your aunt and uncle don't.
1747162 1750290 Oh, they can scream<br />pretty good sometimes.
1751667 1755879 Listen, M.J., about today<br />at school with Flash...
1756129 1757756 You really freaked us out.
1757965 1760217 I'm sorry. Is he okay?
1760509 1764471 He's just happy you didn't give him<br />a black eye for graduation.
1767557 1770769 So where are you going<br />after you graduate?
1775524 1777818 I wanna move into the city.
1778735 1783532 And hopefully get a job<br />as a photographer.
1783699 1786535 Work my way through college.
1787536 1788870 What about you?
1789037 1791039 Headed for the city too.
1791748 1794001 Can't wait to get out of here.
1795168 1796670 I wanna...
1797921 1799423 What?
1802259 1804428 No, come on. Try me.
1805429 1806930 I wanna...
1808056 1809391 ...act...
1810559 1812060 ...on-stage.
1812561 1814396 Really?
1814771 1816940 Oh, that's perfect.
1817232 1819776 You were awesome<br />in all the school plays.
1820110 1821945 - Really?<br />- Yeah.
1822612 1825615 I cried like a baby<br />when you played Cinderella.
1826074 1828285 Peter, that was first grade.
1828785 1830287 Well...
1830829 1832331 ...even so.
1833332 1835250 Sometimes...
1836084 1837753 ...you know people.
1838920 1842507 You can just see what's coming.
1845594 1848347 What do you see coming for you?
1850932 1852601 I don't know.
1854936 1859608 Whatever it is, it's something<br />I never felt before.
1863195 1866114 And what for me?
1866281 1867616 For you?
1869034 1871787 You're gonna light up Broadway.
1873288 1874623 You know...
1879002 1881630 ...you're taller than you look.
1881797 1883340 I hunch.
1885592 1887094 Don't.
1890639 1894309 Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride<br />in my new birthday present.
1895268 1896561 Come on.
1897312 1898980 I gotta go.
1899773 1900982 Bye.
1901650 1904319 - Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!<br />- Yeah, right?
1904486 1906488 - Look at it!<br />- Hop in.
1906655 1908907 Oh, my God! What a cool car!
1909157 1910742 Pretty tight, huh?
1911159 1915497 Wait till you hear the sound system.<br />Hey, don't scratch the leather.
1916998 1918500 Cool car.
2011218 2013261 What's going on in there?
2013470 2016097 I'm exercising.<br />I'm not dressed, Aunt May.
2016264 2019935 Well, you're acting<br />so strangely, Peter.
2020227 2022312 Okay. Thanks.
2053134 2056471 Something's bothering him. Maybe<br />he's too embarrassed to tell me.
2056638 2059307 Maybe I'm too embarrassed<br />to ask him.
2060100 2062143 I just don't know anymore.
2062561 2064896 I'm going to the library.<br />I'll see you later.
2065063 2068692 - Wait, Pete. I'll drive you there, buddy.<br />- I'll take the train.
2068858 2072112 No, I need the exercise.<br />Go on. Go, go.
2083164 2086626 - Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.<br />- Wait a minute, we need to talk.
2086793 2091172 - We can talk later.<br />- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.
2092048 2094259 What do we have to talk about?<br />Why now?
2094426 2096303 Because we haven't talked<br />for so long...
2096469 2098471 ...May and I<br />don't know who you are anymore.
2098638 2103685 You shirk your chores. You have all<br />those weird experiments in your room.
2103852 2107981 - You start fights at school...<br />- I didn't start that fight, I told you that.
2108189 2111151 - You sure as hell finished it.<br />- Was I supposed to run away'?
2111359 2114362 No, you're not supposed<br />to run away, but...
2114529 2119075 Pete, you're changing. I went through<br />exactly the same thing at your age.
2119284 2120827 No. Not exactly.
2120994 2122194 Peter...
2122662 2125373 ...these are the years<br />when a man changes...
2125540 2129544 ...into the man he's gonna become<br />the rest of his life.
2129711 2132005 Just be careful<br />who you change into.
2134341 2138845 This guy, Flash Thompson,<br />he probably deserved what happened.
2139387 2142098 But just because you can<br />beat him up...
2142557 2144809 ...doesn't give you the right to.
2145477 2150732 Remember, with great power<br />comes great responsibility.
2151316 2156321 Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?<br />Quit worrying about me, okay?
2156488 2159908 Something's different.<br />I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing me.
2160200 2164412 I don't mean to lecture or preach.<br />And I know I'm not your father...
2164579 2167415 Then stop pretending to be!
2171503 2172754 Right.
2175715 2177676 I'll pick you up here at 10.
2209040 2214754 <i>Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!</i>
2219467 2223513 - One, two, three. That's it!<br />- Who's the man?
2227642 2229853 Ladies and gentlemen...
2230019 2234566 ...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.
2237652 2241322 For $3000..
2241489 2245118 ...is there no one here man enough<br />to stay in the ring...
2245285 2249998 ...for three minutes<br />with this titan of testosterone?
2252584 2254669 Who?
2254919 2256796 I know who.
2257005 2261801 The Flying Dutchman!
2262135 2263595 Next.
2264429 2267724 There's no featherweight<br />division here, small fry. Next.
2267891 2269726 No, no. Sign me up.
2270143 2273563 Okay. You understand the NYWL<br />is not responsible...
2273772 2277859 ...for any injury you may and probably<br />will sustain in said event?
2278026 2280278 And you're participating<br />under your own free will?
2280445 2281645 Yes.
2281696 2285492 Down the hall to the ramp.<br />May God be with you. Next.
2288077 2290330 Told you! Told you!
2290538 2292332 Winner!
2292540 2293750 Next victim!
2295627 2298505 Are you ready for more?
2299631 2303218 Bone Saw is ready!
2305637 2310308 Will the next victim please<br />enter the arena at this time?
2310517 2315230 If he can withstand just three minutes<br />in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...
2315480 2319859 ...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...
2320735 2323738 - What's your name, kid?<br />- The Human Spider.
2324322 2326699 That's it? That's the best you got?
2326866 2328993 - Yeah.<br />- Oh, that sucks.
2329160 2333665 The sum of $3000 will be paid to...
2333832 2337085 ...the terrifying, the deadly...
2337335 2340547 ...the amazing Spider-Man!
2342924 2345552 - It's "The Human Spider."<br />- I don't care, get out there.
2345718 2348763 - No, he got my name wrong.<br />- Get out there, you moron.
2351224 2353810 Bone Saw will eat you up<br />and spit you out.
2354060 2356062 I hope you brought your mommy.
2356271 2359774 - We'll break you!<br />- You'll need someone to cry to.
2361067 2366197 I'm gonna rip all eight of your<br />feeble legs off one by one.
2366698 2368741 Oh, my God!
2368950 2370577 Oh, my legs!
2370743 2373371 Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.
2373538 2375540 Kill! Kill! Kill!
2383756 2385300 Kill! Kill! Kill!
2385466 2386676 Cage!
2396019 2397478 Hello? Guys?
2398521 2403484 Will the guards please lock<br />the cage doors at this time?
2404193 2408489 This is some kind of mistake.<br />I didn't sign up for a cage match!
2409657 2412160 Unlock the thing!<br />Take the chain off!
2412368 2414162 Hey, freak show!
2414370 2416998 You're going nowhere.
2417165 2419542 I got you for three minutes.
2419709 2422003 Three minutes of playtime.
2428635 2431429 - What are you doing up there?<br />- Staying away from you.
2432305 2434891 That's a cute outfit.<br />Did your husband give it to you?
2442023 2443566 Finish him off!
2450740 2452283 Smash him!
2459457 2461209 - Hit him!<br />- Harder!
2463211 2465546 Kick his spider ass!
2467548 2468748 Hit him!
2482146 2483940 One, two, three!
2484148 2486943 That's it! That's it! Winner!
2487110 2492198 Ladies and gentlemen, give it up<br />for the new champion, Spider-Man!
2493074 2496744 <i>Spider-Man! Spider-Man!<br />Spider-Man!</i>
2509590 2511259 Now get out of here.
2512885 2515722 A hundred bucks'?<br />The ad said 3000.
2515930 2518307 Well, check it again, webhead.
2518474 2522353 It said three grand for three minutes.<br />You pinned him in two.
2522562 2525940 For that, I give you 100.<br />You're lucky to get that.
2526107 2527483 I need that money.
2527942 2531029 I missed the part<br />where that's my problem.
2539120 2542457 - Hey, what the hell...?<br />- Put the money in the bag.
2544292 2545626 Hurry up!
2551966 2554052 Hey! He stole the gate!
2554218 2556179 Stop that guy!
2556471 2559015 Stop him! He's got my money!
2559223 2560475 Thanks.
2561642 2564145 What's the hell's the matter with you?<br />You let him go!
2564312 2566522 Cut him off in the lobby<br />and call the cops!
2566689 2570735 You could've taken that guy apart.<br />Now he'll get away with my money.
2570902 2573154 I missed the part<br />where that's my problem.
2592673 2595593 - Sir, you gotta get back.<br />- I can't see. What happened?
2596844 2598221 Old dude, man.
2598429 2602600 Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.<br />Keep moving. Let's go!
2602767 2605603 - What happened?<br />- Someone got hurt.
2607980 2611192 - Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.<br />- Stay back.
2611692 2613528 - Stay back!<br />- That's my uncle!
2615696 2618407 - What happened?<br />- Carjacker. He's been shot.
2618574 2621994 We just called the paramedics.<br />They're on their way.
2622203 2623579 Uncle Ben?
2624497 2625998 Uncle Ben.
2629752 2631087 Uncle Ben?
2634715 2636217 Peter.
2637093 2638886 I'm here, Uncle Ben.
2644517 2645726 Peter.
2667707 2670751 They got the shooter.<br />He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.
2670960 2675673 We got three cars in pursuit.<br />All right, folks. Come on, move back.
2832788 2834790 Get a unit to the rear!
2837752 2839295 I got the back!
2852224 2853601 Who's there?
2879835 2882963 Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.<br />Give me a chance!
2883130 2887635 What about my uncle?<br />Did you give him a chance? Did you?
2887802 2889303 Answer me!
2892640 2893974 <i>Stop that guy!</i>
2899438 2901148 <i>Thanks.</i>
2911075 2912275 See you.
2933848 2937309 <i>Freeze! We've got the place<br />completely surrounded.</i>
2979810 2982396 Oh, no. My God.
2984356 2988068 Oh, no. Oh, my God. No!
2996410 2999371 - Good evening.<br />- General. Good to see you.
3000164 3003042 Our exoskeleton's got<br />real firepower, general.
3003209 3008380 Well, if it does what you say it can,<br />I'll sign that contract tomorrow.
3009590 3012885 - He's clear, let's go!<br />- You're confident about this test?
3013093 3015346 Absolutely.<br />Captain Curtis is our top pilot.
3016096 3018849 Now, what about your commitment<br />to OSCORP?
3019016 3022937 Nothing would please me more than to<br />put Norman Osborn out of business.
3025272 3028317 Preflight complete. Mark.
3032446 3035074 <i>We are picking up<br />an unidentified object, closing fast.</i>
3035241 3036441 What the hell is that?
3036492 3037993 <i>Can you see anything?</i>
3038452 3039828 Oh, my God!
3050089 3052967 - Say "chess."<br />- Chess!
3053467 3055344 Peter!
3055553 3059473 Darling, I'm so proud of you.<br />You looked so handsome up there.
3059640 3063727 Pete? Good news. Dad got the place<br />in New York, so we're all set this fall.
3063894 3065479 - That's great.<br />- You made it.
3068065 3071569 It's not the first time<br />I've been proven wrong.
3072987 3075155 - Congratulations.<br />- Thanks, Dad.
3075656 3078200 Peter, the science award.<br />That's terrific.
3078576 3079868 Yeah.
3082830 3086208 I know this has been<br />a difficult time for you...
3086375 3089628 ...but I want you to try<br />to enjoy this day.
3089837 3091380 Commencement:
3091547 3095676 The end of one thing,<br />the start of something new.
3097511 3101181 I don't want to be with you anymore.<br />Here's your ring.
3102057 3103934 You know what? Whatever.
3104476 3105936 Your loss.
3106645 3110190 You're like a brother to Harry.<br />That makes you family.
3110357 3113319 And if you ever need anything,<br />just give me a call.
3128083 3130336 Can I fix you something?
3130502 3132004 No, thanks.
3176757 3178967 I missed him a lot today.
3181553 3183055 I know.
3184807 3186642 I miss him too.
3188394 3190729 But he was there.
3193899 3199113 I can't help thinking about<br />the last thing I said to him.
3199405 3204326 He tried to tell me something<br />important, and I threw it in his face.
3206078 3208163 You loved him...
3209832 3212084 ...and he loved you.
3212960 3216630 He never doubted<br />the man you'd grow into.
3216797 3220259 How you were meant<br />for great things.
3220801 3223137 You won't disappoint him.
3256670 3260841 <i>With great power<br />comes great responsibility.</i>
3261008 3264219 <i>Remember that, Pete.<br />Remember that.</i>
3274229 3275522 Hurry up!
3287868 3291622 He's not a man. My brother saw him<br />building a nest in Lincoln Center.
3291789 3295000 I think he's human, a man.<br />Could be a woman.
3299087 3301840 Bobby. Get a load of this!
3305177 3307054 He throws up his hands,<br />ropes come out...
3307221 3309264 ...and he climbs up them<br />like a spider web.
3309556 3313685 I see the web, his signature,<br />and I know Spider-Man was here.
3313852 3316480 The guy protects us,<br />protects the people.
3316647 3319399 Some kind of freakyloo<br />or something. Wackadoo.
3319566 3321568 He stinks and I don't like him.
3322319 3323904 Don't move, lady!
3331995 3334748 Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.
3334957 3337084 He has those tights<br />and that tight little...
3337251 3340587 <i>Dresses like a spider<br />He looks like a bug</i>
3340796 3344550 <i>But we should all just give him<br />One big hug</i>
3344758 3349346 <i>Look out<br />Here comes the Spider-Man</i>
3353016 3356770 "Who is Spider-Man?"<br />He's a criminal, that's who he is.
3356937 3360816 A vigilante, a public menace.<br />Why's he on my front page?
3361024 3362943 <i>Mr. Jameson, your wife needs...</i>
3363110 3364528 There's a page six problem.
3364695 3366613 We have a page one problem.<br />Shut up.
3366780 3368323 - Well?<br />- He's news.
3368532 3370951 - The clients can't wait.<br />- They're about to.
3371118 3375205 - He pulled six people off a subway.<br />- From a wreck he probably caused.
3375372 3377040 Something goes wrong<br />and he's there.
3377207 3379543 Look! He's fleeing the scene.<br />What's that tell you?
3379710 3382462 He's not fleeing, he's probably<br />going to save somebody else.
3382567 3383767 He's a hero!
3383797 3386633 Then why does he wear a mask?<br />What's he got to hide?
3386800 3389761 She needs to know if you want<br />chintz or chenille in the dining room.
3389928 3392472 - Whichever one's cheaper.<br />- Mr. Jameson, it's like this:
3392639 3393974 We double-booked page six.
3394141 3396476 So Macy's and Conway's both have<br />three quarters...
3396643 3399813 - We sold out four printings.<br />- Sold out?
3399980 3401231 Every copy.
3401815 3404318 Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one,<br />with a decent picture.
3404484 3406153 - Conway to page 7.<br />- That's a problem.
3406320 3408655 Page eight, give him 10 percent off.<br />Five percent.
3408822 3410532 - That can't be done.<br />- Get out of here!
3410699 3412618 We don't have a decent picture.
3412784 3415537 Eddie's been on it for weeks,<br />but we can barely see him.
3415704 3417831 Aw, what is he, shy?
3417998 3422002 If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts<br />in a thong, we can get this weirdo.
3422169 3425589 Put an ad on the front page:<br />"Cash for a picture of Spider-Man."
3425756 3429217 He doesn't wanna be famous?<br />I'll make him infamous!
3440437 3441637 Hey!
3441688 3443106 Buzz off.
3443815 3446777 - M.J., it's me, Peter.<br />- Hi!
3448487 3453367 - What are you doing around here?<br />- Begging for a job. How about you?
3453867 3457579 - I'm headed to an audition.<br />- An audition? So you're acting?
3457746 3458946 Yeah.
3458997 3462876 I work steady.<br />In fact, I just got off a job.
3463043 3464243 That's great.
3464795 3468006 - You're doing it. Living your dream.<br />- Glamour girl!
3468173 3469800 Your drawer was short $6!
3469967 3472594 Next time that happens,<br />I'll take it out of your cheque.
3473679 3477474 Excuse me, Miss Watson?<br />I'm talking to you! Hey!
3477683 3479977 Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.
3480143 3484272 It better not happen no more.<br />Don't roll your eyes at me.
3491238 3492948 Some dream, huh?
3493824 3496451 It's nothing to be<br />embarrassed about.
3496618 3499413 - Don't tell Harry.<br />- Don't tell Harry?
3499830 3504418 Don't you guys live together?<br />We're going out. Didn't he tell you?
3504835 3506420 Oh, yeah. Right.
3506670 3509756 I think he'd hate the idea<br />of my waiting tables.
3509923 3514344 - He'd think it was low or something.<br />- It's not low. You have a job.
3514678 3519016 You know, Harry doesn't live on<br />a little place I like to call Earth.
3520517 3522436 No, I guess not.
3527441 3529026 Thanks, Pete.
3530444 3532362 We should catch up sometime.
3536575 3539119 Let's get some lunch some evening.
3540370 3544875 I'll come by and have some of your<br />Moondance coffee some day.
3545083 3547794 - And I won't tell Harry.<br />- No, don't tell Harry.
3547961 3549212 I won't.
3551381 3553133 I won't tell Harry.
3564436 3566897 Timing's perfect. Hey.
3567105 3570400 Five new contracts. It'll be great.
3572527 3575197 Storming Norman's<br />making his weekly inspection.
3576031 3578283 Spent half of it on the phone.
3578867 3583580 Look, man, I'm glad you're here.<br />I need your help. I'm really lost here.
3584414 3585707 Are you all right?
3587042 3591588 You look like you just got<br />second place in the science fair.
3592881 3595801 I was late for work<br />and Dr. Connors fired me.
3595967 3597552 You were late again?
3598178 3600931 I don't get it.<br />Where do you go all the time?
3602307 3603558 Around.
3603725 3605435 Peter Parker.
3605769 3608271 - Maybe you'll tell me who she is.<br />- Who's that?
3608438 3611525 - This mystery girl Harry's been dating.<br />- Dad.
3611900 3613568 - When do I get to meet her?<br />- Dad.
3613735 3617030 Well, sorry.<br />Harry hasn't mentioned her.
3619908 3623161 Pete, you're probably looking<br />for a job now, right?
3623370 3626206 Dad, maybe you can help him out.
3626373 3630710 - No, I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.<br />- It's no problem. I'll make a few calls.
3630877 3635173 No, I couldn't accept it, sir.<br />I like to earn what I get. I'll find work.
3635340 3637008 I respect that.
3637717 3639845 You want to make it<br />on your own steam.
3640512 3641847 That's great.
3642722 3645058 What other skills do you have,<br />Parker?
3645267 3647227 I was thinking about photography.
3650355 3651606 Hello.
3653525 3655819 Let's go! Move it!
3656987 3658655 Watch the street!
3674087 3675463 Cheese!
3684389 3685682 They're crap.
3685891 3688852 Crap, crap. Megacrap.
3689060 3692230 - I'll give you $200 for all of them.<br />- That seems a little low.
3692439 3694191 Take them somewhere else, then.
3694357 3696902 <i>Your wife says the tile for the foyer<br />is out of stock.</i>
3697068 3698695 Tell her we'll put a rug there.
3699070 3701031 Sit down. Give me that.
3702616 3705160 Give you 300.<br />That's the standard freelance fee.
3705327 3707662 - Tear up page one. Run that photo.<br />- Headline?
3707954 3711249 <i>"Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?<br />Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos."</i>
3711416 3713251 Menace? He was protecting<br />that armoured...
3713398 3714598 Tell you what, Atticus.
3714628 3717339 You take the pictures,<br />I'll make up the headlines. Okay?
3717505 3719507 - Yes, sir.<br />- Goody.
3719966 3723470 Give this to the girl up front.<br />She'll see you get paid.
3723970 3726723 - I'd like a job, sir.<br />- No jobs. Freelance.
3726932 3728558 Best thing for a kid your age.
3728767 3733063 You bring me more shots<br />of that clown, maybe I'll buy them.
3733271 3736233 But I never said you have a job.<br />Meat.
3736399 3740695 I'll send you a box of Christmas<br />meat. Bring me more photos.
3742280 3743490 - Hi.<br />- Hi.
3743698 3747118 Mr. Jameson told me<br />to give that to you.
3748203 3751331 - Welcome to the <i>Daily Bugle</i>.<br />- Thank you.
3751873 3753250 I'm Peter Parker.
3755752 3757921 I'm a photographer.
3758713 3761258 Yes. I can see that.
3768974 3770809 As of today...
3770976 3774980 ...OSCORP Industries has surpassed<br />Quest Aerospace...
3775230 3779651 ...as the principal supplier<br />to the United States military.
3779818 3782654 In short, ladies and gentlemen<br />of the board...
3782821 3785991 ...costs are down,<br />revenues are up...
3786241 3789077 ...and our stock<br />has never been higher.
3789244 3793665 Wonderful news, Norman.<br />That's why we're selling the company.
3794729 3795929 What?
3795959 3801131 Quest is recapitalizing in the wake<br />of the bombing. Expanding.
3801339 3804092 They made a tender offer<br />we can't ignore.
3804259 3805459 Why wasn't I told?
3805593 3809681 They don't want a power struggle<br />with entrenched management.
3809973 3812267 The deal is off if you come with it.
3812434 3815854 The board expects your resignation<br />in 30 days.
3816062 3818023 You can't do this to me.
3821192 3823486 I started this company.
3824529 3826948 You know how much I sacrificed?!
3830785 3836249 - Oh, Max. Please.<br />- Norman, the board is unanimous.
3836791 3840795 We're announcing the sale<br />after the World Unity Festival.
3840962 3842464 I'm sorry.
3843465 3845592 You're out, Norman.
3855477 3856978 Am I?
3861066 3864110 <i>Welcome to OSCORP Industries<br />Unity Day Festival.</i>
3864277 3867697 <i>Let's hear it for Macy Gray.</i>
3904150 3907654 M.J., why didn't you wear<br />the black dress?
3908696 3912367 Just, I wanted to impress my father.<br />He loves black.
3912534 3917038 Well, maybe he'll be impressed<br />no matter what. You think I'm pretty.
3917622 3919999 I think you're beautiful.
3932804 3936057 M.J., would you do me a favour?<br />I forgot my drink inside.
3946276 3948403 - Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.<br />- Oh, Harry.
3949487 3954659 - Have you seen my father around?<br />- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.
3966671 3969174 - What is that?<br />- Must be new this year.
3974053 3975305 What is that?
3975472 3976672 That's our glider!
3987817 3989277 What the hell was that?
4017680 4019098 Code three!
4035114 4037283 - Oh, my God! Harry!<br />- M.J.!
4043248 4046709 Harry! Help me! Harry!
4052674 4054425 Out, am I?
4058972 4061057 - Mary Jane!<br />- Harry!
4064185 4066062 Hello, my dear.
4067063 4068898 It's Spider-Man!
4080410 4082370 - Come on, move, kid.<br />- Billy!
4085873 4088209 Somebody help him!
4088418 4089669 No!
4091462 4093006 Mommy!
4095008 4096968 - Hold it!<br />- I surrender.
4097552 4100054 - Oh, boy.<br />- Hold it right there!
4105852 4107103 Impressive.
4131377 4134839 - Mary Jane!<br />- Help! Someone please help me!
4160198 4161398 Hold on!
4162909 4164109 Watch out!
4173044 4176839 We'll meet again, Spider-Man!
4178424 4180343 Hold on, Mary Jane!
4222343 4225012 Well, beats taking the subway.
4225221 4228433 Don't mind us.<br />She just needs to use the elevator.
4228641 4229841 Wait.
4229934 4231185 Who are you?
4231352 4233938 - You know who I am.<br />- I do?
4234147 4236149 Your friendly neighbourhood<br />Spider-Man.
4248494 4252373 Incredible?<br />What do you mean he's incredible?
4253541 4257211 No. All right, wait.<br />Stay there. I'm gonna come over.
4257879 4259547 No, I'm gonna come...
4259881 4263301 All right. Fine.<br />Will you call me in the morning?
4263509 4266471 And we'll go and have breakfast<br />and...
4266637 4268931 ...I wanna buy you something.
4269098 4272435 Because I want to.<br />It'll make you feel better.
4273478 4277148 Okay. And what do you mean,<br />incredible?
4279984 4282361 All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.
4282528 4284280 Don't let the bedbugs...
4290036 4292997 She's all right.<br />She's just a little rattled.
4294707 4298336 Look, Pete, I should have<br />told you about us.
4299712 4302340 But you should know<br />I'm crazy about her.
4302507 4305551 It's just, you know,<br />you never made a move.
4306636 4308137 You're right.
4309055 4310556 I didn't.
4314560 4316979 I'm gonna get some rest.
4318231 4320483 I'm gonna stay up for a while.
4321567 4323319 What was that thing?
4323903 4325321 I don't know.
4326656 4330034 Whatever it is,<br />somebody has to stop it.
4345925 4347593 Somebody there?
4347844 4349887 <i>Somebody.</i>
4351222 4352765 Who said that?
4353432 4356769 <i>Don't play the innocent with me.</i>
4359230 4361899 <i>You've known all along.</i>
4365903 4367280 Where are you?
4367446 4371576 <i>Follow the cold shiver<br />running down your spine.</i>
4378374 4380209 <i>I'm right here.</i>
4381961 4383963 I don't understand.
4384964 4388134 Did you think it was coincidence?
4388384 4391929 So many good things,<br />all happening for you.
4392096 4395766 All for you. Norman.
4398311 4399729 What do you want'?
4400271 4402315 To say what you won't.
4402607 4405151 To do what you can't.
4405318 4409906 To remove those in your way.
4413868 4415828 The board members.
4417121 4418497 You killed them.
4418664 4420291 We killed them.
4420562 4421762 We?
4421792 4423336 Remember?
4423502 4426172 Your little accident<br />in the laboratory.
4428174 4429800 The performance enhancers.
4429967 4435014 Bingo. Me!<br />Your greatest creation.
4435514 4439310 Bringing you<br />what you've always wanted:
4439477 4442355 Power beyond your wildest dreams.
4442521 4445024 And it's only the beginning.
4446525 4450863 There's only one who can stop us.
4451656 4455159 Or imagine if he joined us.
4459956 4463042 Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.
4463209 4466545 The Green Goblin. You like that?<br />Made it up myself.
4466712 4468339 These weirdos<br />all gotta have a name.
4468506 4469715 Mr. Jameson, Spider...
4469882 4471550 - Hoffman!<br />- Yeah?
4472760 4476472 Copyright the name "Green Goblin."<br />I want a quarter every time it's said.
4476639 4477839 How about "Green Meanie"?
4479183 4482061 Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.<br />That's slander.
4482228 4484563 It is not. I resent that.
4484814 4487566 Slander is spoken.<br />In print, it's libel.
4487775 4489402 You don't trust anybody.
4489860 4491612 I trust my barber.
4492363 4493990 What are you, his lawyer? Get out.
4494156 4496283 Let him sue me,<br />get rich like a normal person.
4496450 4498202 That's what made this country...
4506419 4509547 Jameson, you slime.
4509755 4513050 Who's the photographer<br />who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?
4513259 4515094 I don't know.<br />His stuff comes by mail.
4515261 4517179 - You're lying!<br />- I swear.
4517346 4519348 He's the one<br />who can bring me to him.
4519515 4522435 - I don't know who he is.<br />- You are useless.
4522643 4524895 Set him down, tough guy.
4525146 4529150 - Speak of the devil.<br />- I knew you two were in this together!
4529608 4532528 Hey, kiddo, let Mom and Dad<br />talk for a minute, will you?
4532737 4535197 Sleep...
4549670 4553674 Wake up, little spider. Wake up.
4553841 4558262 No, you're not dead yet.
4558471 4560639 Just paralyzed...
4560806 4562767 ...temporarily.
4563768 4566854 You're an amazing creature,<br />Spider-Man.
4567063 4569732 You and I are not so different.
4570441 4573778 I'm not like you. You're a murderer.
4573986 4576864 Well, to each his own.
4577031 4579992 I chose my path,<br />you chose the way of the hero.
4580659 4585289 And they found you amusing<br />for a while, the people of this city.
4585498 4588751 But the one thing they love<br />more than a hero...
4588959 4592546 ...is to see a hero fail,<br />fall, die trying.
4592713 4597343 In spite of everything you've done for<br />them, eventually, they will hate you.
4597489 4598689 Why bother?
4598719 4603432 - Because it's right.<br />- Here's the real truth.
4603849 4606852 There are eight million people<br />in this city.
4607061 4611357 And those teeming masses exist<br />for the sole purpose...
4611565 4615528 ...of lifting the few exceptional<br />people onto their shoulders.
4615694 4617113 You, me...
4617696 4619615 ...we're exceptional.
4619865 4624537 I could squash you like a bug<br />right now.
4624745 4628374 But I'm offering you a choice.<br />Join me.
4628582 4632169 Imagine what we could<br />accomplish together.
4632378 4635131 What we could create.
4635714 4637716 Or we could destroy.
4637883 4641846 Cause the deaths of countless<br />innocents in selfish battle...
4642054 4644473 ...again and again and again until<br />we're both dead.
4644640 4646934 Is that what you want?
4648936 4651814 Think about it, hero.
4663784 4669123 <i>In spite of everything you've done for<br />them, eventually, they will hate you.</i>
4678195 4679395 Hey!
4679425 4680926 - It's me again.<br />- Hey!
4681302 4682720 How was your audition?
4682928 4685931 - How'd you know?<br />- The hot line. Your morn...
4686098 4688058 ...told my aunt, told me.
4688517 4689852 So you just came by?
4690060 4693689 I was in the neighbourhood.<br />Needed to see a friendly face.
4693856 4697568 I took two buses and a cab<br />to get in the neighbourhood, but...
4698694 4700196 So how'd it go?
4702364 4704950 They said I needed acting lessons.
4705117 4708871 A soap opera told me<br />I needed acting lessons.
4709038 4714376 Let me buy you a cheeseburger.<br />The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.
4715711 4717796 I'd like a cheeseburger.
4718255 4721717 Oh, but I'm going out to dinner<br />with Harry.
4722134 4723552 Come with us.
4723719 4726472 No, thanks. How's it going with...?
4728390 4730893 Never mind.<br />That's none of my business.
4731393 4732895 It's not?
4734313 4735981 Why so interested?
4736649 4738150 I'm not.
4738400 4739777 You're not?
4741403 4744156 - Well, why would I be?<br />- I don't know.
4744406 4746200 Why would you be?
4748077 4750412 I, that's a...
4750621 4752122 I don't know.
4754333 4757169 Sorry you won't come with us.
4759630 4761590 I better run, tiger.
4770307 4772309 Hey, check it out, man.
4772476 4774144 Come on, man.
4777690 4780943 Hey, where you going, baby?<br />Come on!
4798836 4800296 Get off me!
4833579 4835080 Wait!
4839918 4842296 You have a knack<br />for getting in trouble.
4842463 4846842 You have a knack for saving my life.<br />I think I have a superhero stalker.
4847051 4848927 I was in the neighbourhood.
4850804 4853432 You are amazing.
4854391 4857102 Some people don't think so.
4858187 4861190 - But you are.<br />- Nice to have a fan.
4861940 4865152 Do I get to say thank you this time?
4866028 4867529 Wait.
4936515 4938684 Let me in! My baby's in there!
4938851 4940936 - Let me go!<br />- The roof's collapsing!
4941103 4944606 - Somebody save my baby!<br />- The roof's about to collapse!
4944815 4946150 Look! Up there!
4952823 4954616 Save my baby, please!
4978307 4979507 No!
4987191 4991195 - It's okay. Your baby's fine.<br />- Oh, my baby!
4992237 4995157 God bless you, Spider-Man.<br />Bless you.
4995407 4997117 Don't let him get away!
4997326 5000579 Hold it! You're under arrest.<br />I'm taking you in.
5000746 5002998 Oh, my God, there's somebody<br />still up there!
5005250 5006450 I'm going.
5008545 5011590 - I'll be here when you get back.<br />- Not coming back, chief.
5012007 5013207 Go! Go!
5022059 5023769 Where are you?
5025812 5027397 Where are you?
5032778 5035155 I'm gonna get you out of here!
5037741 5039243 It's okay.
5046291 5048877 You're pathetically predictable.
5049044 5050963 Like a moth to the flame.
5051838 5054299 What about my generous proposal?
5055342 5058178 Are you in or are you out?
5058387 5060973 It's you who's out, Gobby.<br />Out of your mind.
5061265 5063392 Wrong answer.
5064726 5066228 Oh, great.
5104891 5107686 No one says no to me!
5115027 5118447 - M.J., will you stop goofing around?<br />- Harry, relax.
5120949 5122200 He's here.
5122993 5125621 - Are you ready?<br />- Yeah.
5126330 5128999 Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.
5129207 5132294 Work was murder.<br />I picked up a fruitcake.
5132502 5135839 Thank you, Mr. Osborn.<br />We're so glad you could come.
5136173 5138884 Who is this lovely young lady?
5139051 5143347 I'd like you to meet my father.<br />Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.
5143555 5146224 I've been looking forward<br />to meeting you.
5146433 5150145 - Happy Thanksgiving, sir.<br />- Now, where is Peter?
5150312 5152689 He'd better have remembered<br />that cranberry sauce.
5158487 5162032 Oh, that's weird.<br />I didn't know he was here.
5165035 5166536 Peter?
5171249 5172834 Peter?
5174586 5176296 Is that you?
5181760 5185931 How strange. There's nobody here.
5192396 5196900 - Bit of a slob, isn't he?<br />- All brilliant men are.
5229474 5232102 - Hey, everyone.<br />- Oh, Peter!
5232269 5234104 Sorry I'm late,<br />it's a jungle out there.
5234271 5238108 I had to beat an old lady with a stick<br />to get these cranberries.
5238567 5241403 Thank you.<br />Now then, everybody sit down...
5241570 5243155 ...and we can say grace.
5244740 5246324 Parker.
5246700 5248452 Here we go.
5255417 5257753 - There we are.<br />- It looks delicious.
5258253 5259755 Norman.
5261548 5263842 Will you do the honours?
5275520 5278774 Why, Peter, you're bleeding.
5280525 5282360 Oh, yeah...
5282527 5286948 I stepped off a kerb and got clipped<br />by one of those bike messengers.
5287115 5288658 Well, let me see.
5288867 5290452 Oh, my goodness.
5290619 5293038 - Oh, that looks awful.<br />- No, it's nothing.
5293205 5296333 I'll get the first-aid kit.<br />Then we'll say grace.
5296541 5301838 This is the boys' first Thanksgiving<br />here, and we'll do things properly.
5302798 5305884 How did you say that happened?
5306301 5308011 Bike messenger.
5308220 5310180 Knocked me down.
5315560 5319314 - If you'll excuse me, I've got to go.<br />- Why?
5320148 5323527 Something<br />has come to my attention.
5323735 5324986 Are you all right?
5325195 5328698 I'm fine, just fine.<br />Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.
5329324 5331701 - Enjoy the fruitcake.<br />- Dad!
5333870 5337666 I planned this so you'd meet M.J.,<br />and now you have to leave?
5337874 5339584 I've got to go.
5339876 5344005 - This girl is important to me.<br />- Harry, please. Look at her.
5344214 5348176 Think she's sniffing around<br />because she likes your personality?
5348426 5351429 - What are you saying?<br />- Your mother was beautiful too.
5351596 5352796 They're all beautiful.
5352931 5357018 Until they're snarling after your trust<br />fund like a pack of ravening wolves.
5357227 5358520 You're wrong about her, Dad.
5359020 5362190 A word to the not-so-wise<br />about your little girlfriend:
5362399 5365068 Do what you need to with her,<br />then broom her fast.
5376705 5379207 Thanks for sticking up for me,<br />Harry.
5379416 5382377 - You heard?<br />- Everyone heard that creep.
5382586 5386464 That creep is my father.<br />With luck, I'll be half of what he is.
5386715 5389050 Shut up about stuff<br />you don't understand!
5389217 5390886 Harry Osborn!
5391970 5394014 I'm sorry, Aunt May.
5396975 5400312 <i>Spider-Man is all but invincible.</i>
5400478 5403648 <i>But Parker, we can destroy him.</i>
5403815 5405150 I can't.
5405317 5408320 <i>Betrayal<br />must not be countenanced.</i>
5408570 5410822 <i>Parker must be educated.</i>
5412991 5414284 What do I do?
5414492 5418580 <i>Instruct him in the matters<br />of loss and pain.</i>
5418747 5421791 <i>Make him suffer.<br />Make him wish he were dead.</i>
5422042 5423335 Yes?
5423501 5425420 <i>And then grant his wish.</i>
5426338 5427631 But how?
5427839 5432135 <i>The cunning warrior attacks<br />neither body nor mind.</i>
5432344 5433544 Tell me how!
5433678 5435847 <i>The heart, Osborn.</i>
5436097 5439142 <i>First, we attack his heart.</i>
5441019 5444522 Give us this day our daily bread,<br />and forgive us our trespasses...
5444731 5447692 ...as we forgive those<br />who trespass against us.
5447984 5450946 Lead us not into temptation,<br />but deliver us...
5459537 5462082 Deliver us!
5462290 5463667 Finish it!
5463959 5467879 - Finish it!<br />- From evil!
5473593 5475762 Two milligrams IV.
5477555 5478807 Get the BP.
5479224 5482811 Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?<br />What happened?
5483019 5484354 You have to leave.
5484521 5486231 - What happened?<br />- Those eyes!
5486439 5490485 Those horrible yellow eyes!
5495323 5497867 He knows who I am.
5541828 5543413 I'm sorry.
5547125 5549586 - Will she be okay?<br />- She's gonna be fine.
5549753 5552422 She's been sleeping all day.
5553423 5556176 - Thanks for coming.<br />- Of course.
5560346 5563266 How are you?<br />You okay about the other night?
5563433 5567103 Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad<br />about leaving Aunt May.
5567353 5570315 - Have you talked to Harry?<br />- He called me.
5570774 5572942 I haven't called him back.
5575028 5576738 The fact is...
5577906 5580742 - ...I'm in love with somebody else.<br />- You are?
5580909 5582118 At least I think I am.
5584788 5587832 - It's not the right time to talk about it.<br />- No. Go on.
5587999 5591252 Would I know his name, this guy?
5591461 5594339 You'll think I'm a stupid little girl<br />with a crush.
5594506 5595882 Trust me.
5596132 5597383 It's funny.
5599385 5602764 He's saved my life twice,<br />and I've never even seen his face.
5603515 5606893 - Oh. Him.<br />- You're laughing at me.
5607102 5610063 No, I understand.<br />He is extremely cool.
5610271 5613566 But do you think it's true, all the<br />terrible things they say about him?
5613733 5617654 No, no. Not Spider-Man,<br />not a chance in the world.
5617862 5619489 I know him a little bit.
5619697 5622575 I'm sort of his unofficial<br />photographer.
5622784 5625912 - Has he mentioned me?<br />- Yeah.
5626246 5627705 What'd he say?
5628289 5629624 I said...
5630708 5635004 He asked me<br />what I thought about you.
5635922 5637966 And what did you say?
5638675 5642762 I said, "Spider-Man."
5643096 5647976 I said, "The great thing about M.J...
5648184 5649727 ...is...
5650645 5653898 ...when you look in her eyes...
5656442 5659654 ...and she's looking back in yours...
5660655 5663658 ...everything feels...
5664868 5666703 ...not quite normal.
5667954 5669747 Because you feel...
5670290 5671916 ...stronger...
5673459 5677088 ...and weaker at the same time.
5678131 5680258 You feel excited...
5681134 5683178 ...and at the same time...
5683803 5685430 ...terrified.
5687765 5692061 The truth is, you don't know<br />what you feel...
5693479 5697108 ...except you know what kind of man<br />you want to be.
5699819 5701696 It's as if you've...
5702322 5705491 ...reached the unreachable...
5707076 5709787 ...and you weren't ready for it."
5713249 5715001 You said that?
5715793 5718129 Well, something like that.
5762423 5763925 Dad?
5769264 5771349 Dad, is that you?
5777939 5779440 What is it?
5781693 5786698 Well, you were right about M.J.<br />You're right about everything.
5787699 5790410 She's in love with Peter.
5790702 5792495 - Parker?<br />- Yeah.
5792662 5794622 And how does he feel about her?
5797208 5799752 He's loved her since the 4th grade.
5800712 5805967 He pretends like he doesn't, but<br />there's no one Peter cares for more.
5808886 5810638 I'm so sorry.
5813099 5816561 I haven't always been there for you,<br />have I?
5818313 5821524 You're busy. You're an important man.<br />I understand.
5821733 5823526 That's no excuse.
5824527 5826321 I'm proud of you.
5826863 5831743 I've lost sight of that somewhere.<br />But I'll make it up to you.
5831909 5835246 I'm going to rectify<br />certain inequities.
5849302 5851095 <i>Wake up, little spider.</i>
5851262 5852764 Wake up.
5854098 5855683 Go home, dear.
5855892 5857226 You look awful.
5857435 5859729 - And you look beautiful.<br />- Well, thank you.
5859937 5863232 - I don't like to leave you here.<br />- But I'm safe here.
5863399 5866110 - Can I do anything for you?<br />- You do too much.
5866277 5871824 College, a job, all this time with me.<br />You're not Superman, you know.
5872575 5874327 A smile. Finally.
5874494 5877747 Haven't seen one of those on<br />your face since Mary Jane was here.
5877914 5881292 Hey.<br />You were supposed to be asleep.
5882085 5886881 You know, you were about 6 years old<br />when M.J.'s family moved in next door.
5887090 5891052 And when she got out of the car,<br />and you saw her for the first time...
5891219 5897558 ...you grabbed me and said,<br />"Aunt May, is that an angel?"
5897767 5901312 - Gee, did I say that?<br />- You sure did.
5903981 5906734 Well, Harry's in love with her.
5906943 5910696 - She's still his girl.<br />- Well, isn't that up to her?
5910905 5915493 - She doesn't really know who I am.<br />- Because you won't let her.
5915701 5918830 You're so mysterious all the time.
5919080 5921833 Tell me, would it be so dangerous...
5922041 5926003 ...to let Mary Jane know<br />how much you care?
5926421 5928923 Everybody else knows.
5931968 5933219 I'll be right back.
5933886 5935179 But...
5942520 5944522 Come on, pick up.
5944689 5947984 <i>- Hey, M.J...<br />- Sing your song at the beep.</i>
5949026 5951070 M.J., it's Peter. You there?
5951362 5954198 Hello? You there?
5954699 5959203 I'm just calling to check up on you.<br />Will you call me when you get in?
5959370 5960788 All right, well...
5960955 5962248 Don't...
5963040 5965251 Don't go up any dark alleys.
5965460 5966961 Hello?
5969380 5973092 <i>Can Spider-Man come out to play?</i>
5973301 5975052 Where is she?
6021307 6022975 - What is that?<br />- That's cool!
6023184 6027813 <i>The itsy-bitsy spider<br />Went up the water spout</i>
6027980 6032151 <i>Down came the goblin<br />And took the spider out</i>
6048960 6050670 Goblin, what have you done?
6093170 6097008 Spider-Man!<br />This is why only fools are heroes.
6097425 6099010 Because you never know...
6099218 6104015 ...when some lunatic will come along<br />with a sadistic choice:
6105099 6107685 Let die the woman you love...
6112064 6117153 ...or suffer the little children.
6119530 6121991 - Spider-Man!<br />- Save us!
6122533 6124785 Save us!
6125036 6127622 Make your choice, Spider-Man...
6127830 6131208 ...and see how a hero is rewarded.
6131375 6133461 Don't do it, Goblin!
6133628 6136547 We are who we choose to be.
6136797 6139550 - Now, choose!<br />- No!
6168245 6169830 Everybody stay still!
6179340 6180675 Ahoy up there!
6180841 6183761 We're gonna bring the barge<br />right under you.
6191268 6195398 - He's coming back!<br />- Listen. I need you to climb down.
6195564 6197066 - I can't.<br />- Yes, you can!
6202154 6205199 M.J., you can do it. You have to.
6205366 6206951 Trust me.
6208452 6212289 Hold on tight and go quickly.
6216627 6218671 - Hurry!<br />- I can't. I can't do it.
6218879 6220548 Hang on, Mary Jane!
6248993 6251620 - He's not gonna make it.<br />- He's gonna make it!
6261505 6264717 It's time to die.
6271724 6274185 Come on up here, tough guy,<br />I got something for you!
6274351 6275561 We ought to kick your ass!
6275770 6279148 Leave Spider-Man alone! You're<br />gonna pick on a guy saving kids?
6279815 6281275 I got something for your ass!
6281442 6283319 Mess with Spidey,<br />you mess with New York!
6283486 6285946 You mess with one of us,<br />you mess with all of us!
6299543 6301337 Spider-Man, watch out!
6333202 6337456 Misery, misery, misery.<br />That's what you've chosen.
6338374 6341001 I offered you friendship...
6341168 6343045 ...and you spat in my face.
6394138 6397808 You've spun your last web,<br />Spider-Man.
6397975 6401312 Had you not been so selfish,<br />your little girlfriend's death...
6401478 6403188 ...would have been quick<br />and painless.
6403355 6406734 But now that you've really<br />pissed me off...
6406984 6411864 ...I'm gonna finish her<br />nice and slow.
6416452 6418495 M.J. and I...
6419330 6422625 ...we're gonna have a hell of a time.
6476428 6477972 Peter, stop!
6478138 6480599 Stop! It's me.
6489566 6490985 Mr. Osborn.
6491193 6492778 Peter, thank God for you.
6492987 6495280 You killed those people<br />on that balcony.
6495489 6498534 The Goblin killed!<br />I had nothing to do with it!
6498701 6500452 Don't let him take me again.
6500619 6502663 I beg you. Protect me.
6502830 6506375 You tried to kill Aunt May.<br />You tried to kill Mary Jane.
6506583 6508085 But not you.
6508752 6512715 I tried to stop it.<br />But I couldn't stop it.
6512923 6515009 I would never hurt you.
6515217 6517136 I knew from the beginning...
6517344 6520264 ...if anything ever happened to me...
6520431 6522599 ...it was you I could count on.
6522766 6526103 You, Peter Parker, would save me,<br />and so you have.
6526687 6528522 Thank God for you.
6529523 6530941 Give me your hand.
6532109 6535529 Believe in me<br />as I believed in you.
6536947 6539742 I've been like a father to you.
6541285 6542953 Be a son to me now.
6544747 6546623 I have a father.
6547374 6549877 His name was Ben Parker.
6551754 6553213 Godspeed, Spider-Man.
6572149 6573650 Peter.
6575986 6577279 Don't tell Harry.
6609520 6611230 What have you done?
6611396 6612981 What have you done?!
6636255 6637756 Hey.
6641135 6643178 I'm so sorry, Harry.
6644096 6647224 I know what it's like<br />to lose a father.
6649393 6652688 I didn't lose him.<br />He was stolen from me.
6654273 6656567 One day Spider-Man will pay.
6658443 6661572 I swear on my father's grave,<br />Spider-Man will pay.
6666577 6668412 Thank God for you, Peter.
6669121 6671582 You're the only family I have.
6696106 6698400 <i>No matter what I do...</i>
6698567 6701695 <i>...no matter how hard I try...</i>
6702279 6706116 <i>...the ones I love will always<br />be the ones who pay.</i>
6716835 6719171 You must miss him so much.
6720130 6723175 It's been so hard without him.
6726094 6728972 There's something<br />I've been wanting to tell you.
6730766 6732601 When I was up there...
6733310 6736104 ...and I thought I was gonna die...
6737731 6740484 ...there was only one person<br />who I was thinking of.
6742861 6746073 And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.
6747532 6749493 It was you, Pete.
6750827 6752704 I kept thinking:
6753121 6755916 "I hope I make it through this...
6757376 6761755 ...so I can see Peter Parker's face<br />one more time."
6763131 6764633 Really?
6765008 6770806 There's only one man<br />who's always been there for me...
6772057 6774017 ...who makes me feel...
6774476 6778188 ...like I'm more than I ever<br />thought I could be.
6780315 6781984 That I'm just...
6782651 6784152 ...me.
6785237 6787155 And that's okay.
6789324 6790826 The truth is...
6792953 6794746 ...I love you.
6796832 6798792 I love you so much, Peter.
6819479 6824276 <i>All I wanted was to tell her<br />how much I loved her.</i>
6824443 6826361 I can't.
6828488 6830032 You can't what?
6831158 6832617 Tell you...
6834328 6838582 ...everything.<br />I mean, there's so much to tell.
6839750 6843670 Yeah. There's so much to tell.
6844588 6846590 I want you to know...
6846965 6849634 ...that I will always be there<br />for you.
6849843 6853805 I will always be there<br />to take care of you.
6854806 6856808 I promise you that.
6860103 6862397 I will always be your friend.
6865317 6867194 Only a friend...
6868070 6869613 ...Peter Parker?
6871782 6874618 That's all I have to give.
6900977 6903647 <i>Whatever life holds in store<br />for me...</i>
6903814 6906691 <i>...I will never forget these words:</i>
6906900 6911947 <i>"With great power<br />comes great responsibility."</i>
6912114 6914366 <i>This is my gift.</i>
6914533 6916660 <i>My curse.</i>
6917160 6919079 <i>Who am I?</i>
6919454 6920831 <i>I'm Spider-Man.</i>
