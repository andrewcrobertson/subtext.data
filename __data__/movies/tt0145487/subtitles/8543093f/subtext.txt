285369 288831 Remember, it is a privilege<br />to be here.
289206 292459 We're guests of Columbia<br />University's Science Department.
292668 294878 So behave accordingly.
295045 298090 Let's not have a repeat<br />of our trip to the planetarium.
298298 299925 Come on, people, stay together.
300092 303011 Proceed up the steps<br />and into the building.
304179 307224 M.J.: Where were you?<br />GIRL: Checking out the library.
307391 309935 Looking at the books.<br />Yeah, right.
311687 314064 HARRY: Charles, can we drive<br />around the corner, please?
314231 315524 Why?
315732 317526 The entrance is right there.
317693 321405 Dad, these are public-school kids. I'm not<br />showing up for the field trip in the Rolls.
321572 323907 What, you want me<br />to trade in my car for a Jetta
324074 327077 because you flunkecl out of every<br />private school I ever sent you to?
327244 330247 - It wasn't for me.<br />- Of course it was.
330747 332583 Don't ever be ashamed<br />of who you are.
332749 335252 I'm not ashamed of who I am.
335460 336753 It's just.
336920 338380 Just what, Harry?
338589 340090 Forget it.
343093 344428 Pete!
344845 346513 - Hi, Harry.<br />- Hey, man. What's up?
346680 348056 NORMAN:<br />Harry.
348223 350434 - Won't you be needing this?<br />- Thanks, Dad.
351393 353770 Peter, may I introduce my<br />father, Norman Osborn.
353937 355355 PETER: I've heard so much about you.
355522 359026 Great honor to meet you, sir.<br />Harry says you're a science whiz.
359276 362112 You know,<br />I'm something of a scientist myself.
362279 365449 I read all your research on nanotechnology.<br />Really brilliant.
365616 368660 - And you understood it?<br />- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
368869 372122 Impressive.<br />Your parents must be very proud.
372289 374124 I live with my aunt and uncle.<br />They are proud.
374291 376877 TEACHER:<br />Hey, you two! Let's move!
377044 380714 - Nice to meet you.<br />- Hope to see you again.
383050 386553 - He doesn't seem so bad.<br />- Yeah, not if you're a genius.
386720 388680 I think he wants to adopt you.
388847 389473 GUIDE: There are over 32,000 known<br />species of spider in the world.
389474 393560 GUIDE: There are over 32,000 known<br />species of spider in the world.
393769 396480 They're in the order <i>Araneae</i>,<br />divided into three suborders.
396647 398857 PETER:<br />Wow. That's amazing.
399024 402945 This is the most advanced electron<br />microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.
403278 405322 - It's unreal.<br />- Wow.
405489 408283 GUIDE: Arachnids from all<br />three groups possess
408492 411745 varying strengths which help them<br />in their constant search for food.
412037 416416 For example, the Delena spider,<br />family <i>Sparassidae</i>,
416583 420754 has the ability to jump<br />to catch its prey.
420921 423507 - For the school paper?<br />- Mm-hm.
425634 427010 (CAMERA CLICKS)
427177 432182 Next, we have the net web spider,<br />family <i>Filistatidae</i>,
432391 434267 genus <i>Kukulcania.</i>
434518 438855 It spins an intricate funnel-shaped web<br />whose strands have a tensile strength
439022 444319 proportionately equal to the type of<br />high-tension wires used in bridges.
444778 446446 - Leave him alone.<br />- Or what?
446613 448448 Or his father<br />will fire your father.
448615 449616 (GUYS LAUGH)
450033 452369 What's Daddy gonna do?<br />Sue me?
452536 455038 What is going on?
455205 458291 The next person who talks will<br />fail this course. I kid you not.
458500 460502 GUIDE: This spider<br />- Let's go.
460669 464840 hunts using a set of reflexes with<br />nerve-conduction velocity so fast
465048 468552 that some researchers believe<br />it borders on precognition.
468719 470887 - An early awareness of danger.<br />- Those guys are jerks.
471054 472848 A spider-sense.
473473 475142 Hey, look at that spider.
475308 479730 Some spiders change colors<br />to blend into their environment.
479980 481898 It's a defense mechanism.
482065 485360 Peter, what makes you think<br />I would want to know that?
485527 486737 Who wouldn't?
486903 490741 GUIDE: Over five painstaking years,<br />Columbia's genetic research facility.
490907 495287 HARRY: You gonna talk to her now?<br />PETER: Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.
495495 497414 GUIDE:<br />Armed with these DNA blueprints
497581 500250 we have now begun<br />what was once thought impossible.
500459 504129 - Disgusting.<br />- Yeah, hateful little things.
504337 505714 I love them.
506256 507924 Yeah, me too.
508884 512763 You know, spiders<br />can change their color
512929 516767 - to blend into their environment.<br />- Really?
516933 521146 - Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.<br />- Cool.
521313 524649 GUIDE: ...transfer RNA to<br />encode an entirely new genome
524816 527944 combining the genetic<br />information from all three spiders
528111 532783 into these 15 genetically<br />designed super-spiders.
532949 534451 There's 14.
534910 536286 GUIDE:<br />I beg your pardon?
536453 538997 M.J.: One's missing.<br />HARRY: Yeah.
541917 544544 GUIDE: I guess the researchers<br />are working on that one.
545045 548381 Do you know that this is the<br />largest electron microscope
548548 549800 on the Eastern Seaboard?
549966 554012 You were talking throughout that<br />woman's entire presentation.
554179 555931 Let's go talk about<br />how we listen.
560018 562895 TEACHER: Now, I don't know what it's<br />like at those fancy private schools,
562896 564106 TEACHER: Now, I don't know what it's<br />like at those fancy private schools,
564314 566191 but at Midtown High...
572531 573990 Hey.
574658 578411 PETER: Could I take your picture?<br />I need one with a student in it.
578578 580163 M.J.: Sure. Yeah.<br />PETER: Great.
580330 582541 Where do you want me?<br />Over here?
582749 584084 Yeah, that's great.
584501 586169 Don't make me look ugly.
586545 588380 That's impossible.
593510 595262 (CAMERA CLICKS)
595637 596888 Perfect.
597180 598723 (CAMERA CLICKING)
602352 603854 (CAMERA CLICKS)
604646 606189 - Is that good?<br />- Great.
607899 609442 (CAMERA CLICKS)
611736 613113 That's great.
618702 620704 GIRL:<br />M.J., let's go!
622247 624833 Wait. Thanks!
626376 627794 Ah!
638305 641057 TEACHER:<br />Parker, let's do it.
657782 661244 We solved the horizon glide<br />and the multi-G balance issues.
661411 663955 I've already seen the glider.
664372 666416 That's not what I'm here for.
666625 669294 General Slocum,<br />good to see you again.
670128 672297 Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.
672547 674382 - Norman.<br />- Mr. Osborn.
674549 678094 Always a pleasure to have our board<br />of directors pay us a little visit.
678303 681723 I want to see the progress report<br />on human performance enhancers.
681890 686394 We tried vapor inhalation with rodent<br />subjects. Their strength increased by 800%.
686561 688438 - FARGAS: That's excellent.<br />- Any side effects?
688605 689689 In one trial, yes.
689856 692525 It was an aberration. All the tests<br />since then have been successful.
692692 696446 And in the trial that went wrong, what<br />happened? What were the side effects?
696613 698949 Violence, aggression...
699616 700867 and insanity.
701034 703787 - What do you recommend?<br />- That was only one test.
704037 707874 Except for Dr. Stromm,<br />our entire staff certifies the product
708041 710961 - ready for human testing.<br />- Dr. Stromm?
712295 715966 We need to take the whole line<br />back to formula.
717217 719636 - Back to formula?<br />- Dr. Osborn.
720804 722639 I'll be frank with you.
722889 727727 I never supported your program. We<br />have my predecessor to thank for that.
727894 730647 Norman, the general gave<br />the go-ahead to Quest Aerospace
730814 733733 to build a prototype<br />of their exoskeleton design.
734067 737654 - They test in two weeks.<br />- And if your performance enhancers
737821 742242 have not had a successful<br />human trial by that date,
742492 746871 I'm gonna pull your funding.<br />I'm going to give it to them.
748665 750333 Gentlemen. Ladies.
755422 760844 And the Lord said, "Let there be light."<br />And voilà! There is light.
761094 763179 Forty soft, glowing watts of it.
763346 768184 Good boy. God will be thrilled.<br />Just don't fall on your ass.
768518 770937 I'm already on my ass, May.
771104 775608 When the plant's senior electrician<br />is laid off after 35 years,
775775 778486 what else would you call it?<br />I am on my ass.
778695 781031 Hand me that dish.<br />The green one.
781281 784034 The corporation is<br />downsizing the people
784492 786369 and upsizing their profits.
786619 789539 Oh, Ben, you'll get<br />another job somewhere.
790582 793460 Well. Well, let's look<br />in the paper and see.
794586 797380 There are the want ads.<br />What do we got here?
797547 799174 Computer.
799382 803136 Computer salesman, computer<br />engineer, computer analyst.
803303 807057 My Lord, even the computers<br />need analysts these days.
807349 812645 May, I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and<br />besides, I have a family to provide for.
812854 815732 I love you.<br />And Peter loves you.
815982 819235 You're the most responsible man<br />I've ever known.
819486 822739 We've been down-and-out before.<br />But somehow, we survive.
822906 823907 Yeah.
825033 829329 MAY: Hi, sweetie. You're just...<br />Just in time for dinner.
829537 832082 Hey. How you doing, buddy?<br />How was the field trip?
832248 835085 PETER: I don't feel well.<br />I'm gonna go to sleep.
835251 837754 - You won't have a bite?<br />- No thanks. Had a bite.
837921 840340 Did you get some<br />pictures, Peter?
840507 844010 Uh... I gotta crash.<br />Everything's fine.
845428 847013 What's that all about?
868284 870495 GUIDE:<br /><i>In this recombination lab</i>

898022 901985 STROMM: Dr. Osborn, please. The<br />performance enhancers aren't ready.
902152 905488 The data just doesn't<br />justify this test.
905655 909325 Now, I'm asking you for the last time.<br />We can't do this.
909492 911703 NORMAN: Don't be a coward.
912162 914747 Risks are part of laboratory science.
914956 918668 Let me reschedule, with a proper<br />medical staff and a volunteer.
918877 922338 - Just give me two weeks.<br />- Two weeks? In two weeks,
922505 926009 we'll have lost the contract to<br />Quest and OSCORP will be dead.
926176 928928 Sometimes you gotta<br />do things yourself.
929095 931764 - Get me the Promachloraperazine.<br />- For what?
931931 935685 It begins oatalyzation when the<br />vapor hits the bloodstream.
938605 940273 40,000 years of evolution
940440 944194 and we've barely even tapped<br />the vastness of human potential.

2056638 2059308 Maybe I'm too embarrassed<br />to ask him.
2060100 2062144 I just don't know anymore.
2062561 2064896 I'm going to the downtown library.<br />I'll see you later.

2086793 2091173 - We can talk later.<br />- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.
2092049 2094259 What do we have<br />to talk about? Why now?
2094426 2096303 Because we haven't talked<br />at all for so long.
2096470 2098472 Your Aunt May and I don't<br />know who you are anymore.
2098639 2103685 You shirk your chores. You have all<br />those weird experiments in your room.
2103852 2107981 - You start fights at school...<br />- I didn't start that fight, I told you that.
2108190 2111151 - You sure as hell finished it.<br />- Was I supposed to run away?
2111360 2114363 No, you're not supposed<br />to run away, but...
2114529 2119076 Pete, look, you're changing. I know. I went<br />through exactly the same thing at your age.
2119284 2120827 No. Not exactly.

2125540 2129544 into the man he's gonna become<br />the rest of his life.

2134341 2138845 This guy, Flash Thompson,<br />he probably deserved what happened.
2139388 2142099 But just because you can<br />beat him up
2142557 2144810 doesn't give you the right to.
2145477 2150732 Remember, with great power<br />comes great responsibility.
2151316 2156321 Are you afraid that I'm gonna turn into some<br />kind of criminal? Quit worrying about me, okay?
2156488 2159908 Somethings different. I'll figure it out.<br />Stop lecturing me. Please.
2160200 2164413 I don't mean to lecture and I don't mean to<br />preach. And I know I'm not your father...
2164579 2167416 Then stop pretending to be!

3050089 3052967 MAN: Say "chess."<br />ALL: Chess!
3053467 3054468 MAY:<br />Peter.
3055553 3059473 Darling, I'm so proud of you.<br />You looked so handsome up there.
3059640 3063728 Pete? Good news. My father got the place<br />in New York, so we're all set this fall.
3063894 3065479 - That's great.<br />- NORMAN: You made it.
3068065 3071569 It's not the first time<br />I've been proven wrong.
3072987 3075156 - Congratulations.<br />- Thanks, Dad.
3075656 3078200 Peter, the science award.<br />That's terrific.
3078576 3079869 Yeah.
3082830 3086208 I know this has been<br />a difficult time for you,
3086375 3089629 but I want you to try<br />to enjoy this day.
3089837 3091380 Commencement:
3091547 3095676 The end of one thing,<br />the start of something new.
3097511 3101182 I don't want to be with you anymore.<br />Here's your ring.
3102058 3103934 You know what?<br />Whatever.
3104477 3105936 Your loss.
3106646 3110191 NORMAN: You're like a brother to Harry.<br />That makes you family.
3110358 3113319 And if you ever need anything,<br />just give me a call.
3126791 3129418 Can I...?<br />Can I fix you something?
3130503 3132004 No, thanks.
3176757 3178968 I missed him a lot today.
3181554 3183055 I know.
3184807 3186642 I miss him too.
3188394 3190730 But he was there.
3193899 3199113 I can't help thinking about<br />the last thing I said to him.
3199405 3204326 He tried to tell me something<br />important, and I threw it in his face.
3206078 3208164 You loved him...
3209832 3212084 and he loved you.
3212960 3216630 He never doubted<br />the man you'd grow into.
3216797 3220259 How you were meant<br />for great things.
3220801 3223137 You won't disappoint him.
3256670 3260841 BEN: <i>With great power comes<br />great responsibility.</i>
3261008 3264220 <i>Remember that, Pete.<br />Remember that.</i>
3274230 3275523 ROBBER:<br />Hurry up!
3287868 3289995 This is not a man.<br />My brother saw him
3290162 3291622 building a nest in<br />the Lincoln Center fountain.
3291789 3295000 I think he's human. I think he's a man.<br />Could be a woman.

3296836 3298546 (SIREN WAILING)
3299088 3301841 Bobby. Get a load of this!
3305177 3307054 He throws up his hands,<br />ropes come out
3307221 3309265 and he climbs up the ropes<br />like a spider web.
3309557 3313686 WOMAN: I see the web, and it's his<br />signature, and I know Spider-Man was here.
3313853 3316480 MAN: The guy protects us. You<br />know, he protects the people.
3316647 3319400 Some kind of freakyloo<br />or something. Wackadoo.
3319567 3321569 He stinks and I don't like him.
3322319 3323904 MAN:<br />Don't move, lady!
3331996 3334748 Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.
3334957 3337084 He has those tights<br />and that tight little...

3353017 3356770 JAMESON: "Who is Spider-Man?" He's<br />a criminal, that's who he is.
3356937 3359982 A vigilante, a public menace.<br />Why's he on my front page?
3360149 3361233 (INTERCOM BUZZES)
3361400 3362943 WOMAN: <i>Mr. Jameson, your<br />wife is on line one.</i>
3363110 3364528 There's a page six problem.
3364695 3366614 We have a page one problem.<br />Shut up.
3366780 3368324 - Well?<br />- He's news.
3368532 3370951 The clients can't wait.<br />They're about to.
3371118 3375205 - He pulled six people off a subway.<br />- From a wreck he probably caused.
3375372 3377041 Something goes wrong<br />and this creepy crawler is there.
3377207 3379543 Look at that. He's fleeing the scene.<br />What's that tell you?
3379710 3382463 ROBBIE: He's not fleeing, he's<br />probably going to save somebody else.
3382630 3383631 He's a hero!
3383797 3386634 Then why does he wear a mask?<br />Hm? What's he got to hide?
3386800 3389762 She needs to know if you want<br />chintz or chenille in the dining room.
3389929 3392473 - Whichever one's cheaper.<br />- Mr. Jameson, it's like this:
3392640 3393974 We double-booked page six.
3394141 3396477 See, so both Macy's and Conway's<br />both have three quarters...
3396644 3399813 ROBBIE: We sold out four printings.<br />JAMESON: Sold out?
3399980 3401231 Every copy.
3401815 3404318 Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one,<br />with a decent picture this time.
3404485 3406153 - Move Conway to page seven.<br />- That's a problem.
3406320 3408656 Make it page eight, give him<br />10 percent off. Five percent.
3408822 3410532 - That can't be done.<br />- Get out of here!
3410699 3412618 Problem is, we don't<br />have a decent picture.
3412785 3415537 Eddie's been on it for weeks. We<br />can barely get a glimpse of him.
3415704 3417831 Aw, what is he, shy?
3417998 3422002 If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a<br />thong, we can get a picture of this weirdo.
3422169 3425589 Put an ad on the front page:<br />"Cash for a picture of Spider-Man."
3425756 3429218 He doesn't wanna be famous?<br />I'll make him infamous!
3440437 3441522 PETER:<br />Hey!
3441689 3443107 Buzz off.
3443816 3446777 M.J.: it's me, Peter.<br />PETER: Hi.
3448487 3453367 - What are you doing around here?<br />- Begging for a job. How about you?
3453867 3457579 - I'm headed to an audition.<br />- An audition? So you're acting now?
3457746 3458789 Yeah.
3458998 3462876 I work steady.<br />In fact, I just got off a job.
3463043 3464211 That's great, M.J.
3464795 3468007 PETER: You're doing it. Living your dream.<br />MAN: Glamour girl!
3468173 3469800 Your drawer was short $6.
3469967 3472594 MAN: Next time that happens,<br />I'll take it out of your check.
3473679 3477474 Excuse me, Miss Watson?<br />I'm talking to you! Hey!
3477683 3479977 Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.
3480144 3484273 It better not happen no more, you hear me?<br />Don't roll your eyes at me.
3491238 3492948 Some dream, huh?
3493824 3496452 That's nothing to be<br />embarrassed about.
3496618 3499413 - Don't tell Harry.<br />- Don't tell Harry?
3499830 3504418 Are you guys living together? We're<br />going out. Didn't he tell you?
3504835 3506420 Oh, yeah. Right.
3506670 3509757 I think he'd hate the idea<br />of my waiting tables.
3509923 3514344 - He'd think it was low or something.<br />- It's not low. You have a job.
3514678 3519016 You know, Harry, he doesn't live on a<br />little place I like to call Earth.
3520517 3522436 No, I guess not.
3527441 3529026 Thanks, Pete.
3530444 3532362 We should catch up sometime.
3536575 3539119 Let's get some lunch<br />some evening.
3539286 3544875 Uh... Well, I'll come by and have some<br />of your Moondance coffee some clay.
3545084 3547795 - And I won't tell Harry.<br />- No, don't tell Harry.
3547961 3549213 I won't.
3551381 3553133 I won't tell Harry.
3564436 3566897 Timing's perfect.<br />Hey.

3572528 3575197 Storming Norman's<br />making his weekly inspection.
3576031 3578283 Spent half of it on the phone.
3578867 3583580 Look, man, I'm glad you're here. I<br />need your help. I'm really lost here.
3584414 3585707 Are you all right?
3587042 3590420 You look like you just got<br />second place in the science fair.
3590587 3592005 No, I, uh...
3592881 3595801 I was late for work<br />and Dr. Connors fired me.
3595968 3597553 You were late again?
3598178 3600931 I don't get it.<br />Where do you go all the time?
3602307 3603559 Around.
3603725 3605435 NORMAN:<br />Peter Parker.
3605769 3608272 - Maybe you'll tell me who she is.<br />- Who's that?
3608438 3611525 - This mystery girl Harry's been dating.<br />- Dad.
3611900 3613569 - When do I get to meet her?<br />- Dad.
3613735 3617030 Well, sorry.<br />Harry hasn't mentioned her.
3619908 3623162 Hey, Pete, you're probably looking<br />for a job now, right?
3623370 3626206 Dad, maybe you can help him out.
3626373 3630711 - No, I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.<br />- It's no problem. I'll make a few calls.
3630878 3635174 No, I couldn't accept it, sir. I like<br />to earn what I get. I'll find work.
3635340 3637009 I respect that.
3637718 3639845 You want to make it<br />on your own steam.
3640512 3641847 That's great.
3642723 3645058 What other skills do you have,<br />Parker?
3645267 3647853 I was thinking about something<br />in photography.

3685891 3688852 Crap, crap. Megacrap.
3689061 3692231 - I'll give you $200 for all of them.<br />- That seems a little low.
3692439 3693440 Take them somewhere else, then.

3728767 3733063 You bring me more shots of that newspaper-selling<br />clown, maybe I'll take them off your hands.

3794750 3795751 NORMAN: What?
3795959 3801131 Yes. Quest is recapitalizing in the<br />wake of the bombing. Expanding.
3801340 3804092 They made a tender offer<br />we can't ignore.
3804259 3805427 Why wasn't I told?
3805594 3809681 The last thing they want is a power<br />struggle with entrenched management.
3809973 3812267 FARGAS:<br />The deal is off if you come with it.
3812434 3815854 The board expects your resignation<br />in 30 days.
3816063 3818023 NORMAN: You can't do this to me.

4585498 4588751 But the one thing they love<br />more than a hero
4588960 4592547 is to see a hero fail,<br />fall, die trying.
4592713 4597343 In spite of everything you've done for<br />them, eventually, they will hate you.
4597510 4598511 Why bother?

4611566 4615528 of lifting the few exceptional<br />people onto their shoulders.

4637884 4641846 Cause the deaths of countless<br />innocents in selfish battle
4642054 4644473 again and again and again until<br />we're both dead.

5580909 5582119 At least I think I am.
5584788 5587833 - It's not the right time to talk about it.<br />- No, no. Go on.
5587999 5591253 Would I know his name, this guy?
5591461 5594339 You'll think I'm a stupid<br />little girl with a crush.
5594506 5595882 Trust me.
5596133 5597384 It's funny.
5599386 5602764 He's saved my life twice,<br />and I've never even seen his face.
5603515 5606893 - Oh. Him.<br />- You're laughing at me.
5607102 5610063 No, I understand.<br />He is extremely cool.
5610272 5613567 But do you think it's true, all the<br />terrible things they say about him?
5613733 5617654 No, no. Not Spider-Man,<br />not a chance in the world.
5617863 5619489 I know him a little bit.
5619698 5622576 I'm sort of his unofficial<br />photographer.
5622784 5625912 - Has he mentioned me?<br />- Yeah.
5626246 5627497 What'd he say?
5627664 5629624 Uh... I said.
5630709 5635005 He asked me<br />what I thought about you.
5635922 5637966 And what did you say?
5638675 5642762 I said, "Spider-Man..."
5643096 5647976 I said,<br />"The great thing about M.J
5648185 5649728 is...
5650645 5653899 when you look in her eyes...
5656443 5659654 and she's looking back in yours...
5660655 5663658 everything feels...
5664868 5666703 not quite normal.
5667954 5669748 Because you feel...
5670290 5671917 stronger...
5673460 5677088 and weaker at the same time.
5678131 5680258 You feel excited...
5681134 5683178 and at the same time...
5683803 5685430 terrified.
5687766 5692062 The truth is, you don't know<br />what you feel...
5693480 5697108 except you know what kind<br />of man you want to be.
5699819 5701696 It's as if you've...
5702322 5705492 reached the unreachable...
5707077 5709788 and you weren't ready for it."
5713250 5715001 You said that?
5715794 5718129 Well, something like that.

5781693 5786698 Well, you were right about M.J.<br />You're right about everything.
5787699 5790410 She's in love with Peter.
5790702 5792495 Parker?<br />Yeah.
5792662 5794622 And how does he feel about her?
5797208 5799753 He's loved her since<br />the 4th grade.
5800712 5805967 He pretends like he doesn't, but<br />there's no one Peter cares for more.
5807594 5810638 Oh. I'm so sorry.
5813099 5816561 I haven't always been there<br />for you, have I?
5818313 5821524 You're busy. You're an important man.<br />I understand.

5880625 5881918 (CHUCKLES)
5882085 5886881 You know, you were about 6 years old<br />when M.J.'s family moved in next door.
5887090 5891052 And when she got out of the car,<br />and you saw her for the first time,
5891219 5897559 you grabbed me and said, "Aunt May.<br />Aunt May, is that an angel?"
5897767 5901312 - Gee, did I say that?<br />- You sure did.
5903982 5906734 Well, Harry's in love with her.
5906943 5910697 - She's still his girl.<br />- Well, isn't that up to her?
5910905 5915493 - She doesn't really know who I am.<br />- Because you won't let her.
5915702 5918830 You're so mysterious all the time.
5919080 5921833 Tell me, would it be<br />so dangerous
5922041 5926004 to let Mary Jane know<br />how much you care?

6747533 6749493 It was you, Pete.

6757376 6761755 so I can see Peter Parker's face<br />one more time."

6774476 6778188 like I'm more than I ever<br />thought I could be.
6780316 6781984 That I'm just...
6782651 6784153 me.
6785237 6787156 And that's okay.

6824443 6826362 I can't.
6828489 6830032 You can't what?
6831158 6832618 Tell you...
6834328 6838582 everything. I mean,<br />there's so much to tell.
6839750 6843670 Yeah. There's so much to tell.
