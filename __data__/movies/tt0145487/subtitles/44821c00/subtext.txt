185564 186563 Who am I?
186922 188428 You sure you wanna know?
188940 191589 The story of my life is not<br />for the faint of heart.
192356 194827 If somebody said it was<br />a happy little tale...
195189 199384 if somebody told you I was just your<br />average guy, not a care in the world...
199815 201063 somebody lied.
202481 203677 But let me assure you,
203701 206065 this like any story worth telling...
206231 207606 is all about a girl.
208397 209301 That girl.
209325 210885 The girl next door.
211184 212824 Mary Jane Watson.
213147 216011 The woman I've loved since<br />before I even liked girls.
216314 218640 I'd like to tell you that's me next to her.
219231 220847 Aw, heck, I'd even take him.
222564 223301 Hey!
223445 224601 Stop the bus!
226147 227146 That's me.
227523 229397 Tell him to stop! Please!
229564 230563 Stop!
230879 232969 Hey! Stop the bus!
233147 234010 Stop the bus!
234034 236433 He's been chasing us<br />since Woodhaven Boulevard.
236648 237898 Catch a cab, Parker!
242356 243911 Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.
250564 251815 What a geek!
252523 253927 Don't even think about it.
253951 255996 You're so lame, Parker.
256898 258648 Would you date him?
276356 277953 Midtown High seniors.
278731 280010 No wandering.
280442 281901 Proceed direct. Knock it off.
282689 285733 Remember, it is a privilege to be here.
286564 289856 We're guests of Columbia<br />University's Science Department.
289881 291496 So behave accordingly.
292397 294816 Let's not have a repeat<br />of our trip to the planetarium.
295648 297272 Come on, people, stay together.
297439 299694 Proceed up the steps<br />and into the building.
301523 303800 Where were you?<br />Checking out the library.
304731 306666 Looking at the books.<br />Yeah, right.
309319 311397 Charles, can we drive<br />around the corner, please?
311564 312563 Why?
313065 314856 The entrance is right there.
315023 318731 Dad, these are public-school kids.<br />I'm not showing up in the Rolls.
318898 321477 What, you want me to trade in<br />my car for a Jetta...
321502 324539 because you flunked out of every<br />private school I sent you to?
324564 325593 It wasn't for me.
325719 326874 Of course it was.
328206 330040 Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
330065 331627 I'm not ashamed of who I am.
332773 333772 It's just...
334189 335215 Just what, Harry?
335898 336897 Forget it.
340170 341169 Pete!
342147 343815 Hi, Harry.<br />Hey, man. What's up?
343981 344980 Harry.
345523 346718 Won't you be needing this?
347170 348169 Thanks, Dad.
348816 351065 Peter, may I introduce<br />my father, Norman Osborn.
351415 352844 I've heard so much about you.
352957 354301 Great honor to meet you, sir.
354325 356413 Harry says you're a science whiz.
356564 357218 You know,
357242 359397 I'm something of a scientist myself.
359564 362731 I read all your research on nanotechnology.<br />Really brilliant.
362898 364010 And you understood it?
364034 365981 Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
366147 367146 Impressive.
367449 369189 Your parents must be very proud.
369363 371154 I live with my aunt and uncle.<br />They are.
371400 373984 Hey, you two! Let's move!
374314 375343 Nice to meet you.
375906 377053 Hope to see you again.<br />Yeah.
380314 381718 He doesn't seem so bad.
381899 383405 Not if you're a genius.
383856 385455 I think he wants to adopt you.
386105 387927 There are over 32,000,
387951 390645 known species of spiders in the world.
391023 392802 They're in the order Araneae,
393043 394790 divided into three suborders.
394988 396018 That's amazing!
396272 400356 This is the most advanced electron<br />microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.
400523 401579 It's unreal.
402731 403718 Arachnids,
403742 405200 from all three groups possess,
405225 408619 varying strengths which help<br />them in their constant search for food.
409105 410010 For example,
410034 411635 the Delena spider,
411801 413335 family Sparassidae...
413815 415052 has the ability,
415200 417271 to jump to catch its prey.
418147 419301 For the school paper?
424397 425760 Next we have,
425942 427301 the net web spider,
427722 429439 family Filistatidae...
429712 431350 genus Kukulcania.
431689 434094 It spins an intricate funnel shaped web
434607 436590 whose strands have a tensile strength,
436857 439635 proportionately equal to a type<br />of high tension wire
439660 441449 used in bridge building.
441981 443689 Leave him alone.<br />Or what?
443856 446129 Or his father will fire your father.
447231 448510 What's Daddy gonna do?
448534 449564 Sue me?
449731 451219 What is going on?
451932 454094 The next person who talks<br />will fail this course.
454406 455405 I kid you not.
455689 457059 This grass spider...<br />Let's go.
457160 459176 Hunts using a set of reflexes
459200 461991 with nerve conduction velocity so fast,
462231 465689 that some researchers believe<br />that it almost borders on precognition.
465897 467897 An early awareness of danger.<br />Those guys are jerks.
468230 470022 A spider-sense.
470647 472108 Hey, look at that spider.
472378 476112 Some spiders change colors<br />to blend into their environment.
477147 478640 It's a defense mechanism.
479230 480229 Peter,
480498 482521 what makes you think<br />I would want to know that?
482689 483573 Who wouldn't?
483650 486094 Over five painstaking years,
486117 488269 Columbia's genetic research facility...
488294 489510 You gonna talk to her now?
489534 492611 No. Come on. You talk to her.
492693 494609 Armed with these DNA blueprints...
494731 497580 we have now begun what<br />was once thought impossible.
497608 498718 Disgusting.
499200 501089 Yeah, hateful little things.
501480 502855 I love them!
503397 504414 Yeah, me too.
506023 507022 You know,
507363 509322 spiders can change their color...
509697 511844 to blend into their environment.
512389 513388 Really?
514064 516343 Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
517782 518530 Cool.<br />Yeah.
518555 521598 Transfer RNA to encode<br />an entirely new genome
521939 525063 combining the genetic information<br />rom all three spiders
525230 525885 into these,
525909 529397 15 genetically designed super-spiders.
529790 530898 There's 14.
532023 533022 I beg your pardon?
533564 534563 One's missing.
535044 536043 Yeah.
539023 541646 I guess the researchers<br />are working on that one.
542240 545572 Do you know that this is<br />the largest electron microscope
545597 546980 on the Eastern Seaboard?
547064 550364 You were talking throughout<br />that woman's entire presentation.
551272 553022 Let's go talk about how we listen.
557105 557802 Now,
558011 560680 I don't know what it's like<br />at those fancy private schools...
561397 563395 but at Midtown High...<br />112.5.
569624 570623 Hey.
571902 573094 Could I take your picture?
573117 574845 I need one with a student in it.
575561 576844 Sure, yeah.
576868 578010 Great.<br />Where do you want me?
578627 579626 Over here?
579814 581146 Yeah. Yeah that's great.
581564 582834 Don't make me look ugly.
583792 585119 That's impossible.
592970 593969 Perfect.
601689 603084 Is that good?<br />Great.
608772 609771 That's great.
615731 617216 MJ, let's go!
619272 620271 Wait.
620424 621423 Thanks!
635314 636313 Parker,
636931 637930 let's do it.
654772 656468 We solved the horizon glide,
656624 658229 and the multi-G balance issues.
658397 660511 I've already seen the glider.
661355 663250 That's not what I'm here for.
663605 665524 General Slocum,<br />good to see you again.
667105 669271 Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.
669420 670218 Norman.
670312 671322 Mr. Osborn.
671522 675063 Always a pleasure to have our board<br />of directors pay us a little visit.
675272 678688 I want to see the progress report<br />on human performance enhancers.
678856 681610 We tried vapor inhalation<br />with rogue subjects,
681701 683354 they showed an 800% increase in strength!
683404 685278 800%? That's excellent.<br />Any side effects?
685564 686683 In one trial, yes.
686708 687635 It was an aberration.
687659 689501 All the tests since<br />then have been successful.
689647 691844 And in the trial that went wrong,<br />what happened?
691868 693193 What were the side effects?
693493 694492 Violence,
694684 695714 aggression...
696564 697712 and insanity.
697981 699094 And what do you recommend?
699117 700623 That was only one test.
700981 702718 With the exception of Dr. Stromm,
702742 704909 our entire staff certifies the product
704981 706426 ready for human testing.
706699 707883 Dr. Stromm?
709230 711501 We need to take the whole line<br />back to formula.
714147 715343 Back to formula?
715367 716387 Dr. Osborn.
717731 719109 I'm gonna be frank with you.
719814 721844 I never supported your program.
722161 724315 We have my predecessor<br />to thank for that.
724814 725385 Norman,
725409 727706 the general gave<br />the go-ahead to Quest Aerospace
727731 730246 to build a prototype<br />of their exoskeleton design.
730981 732260 They test in two weeks.
732284 735635 And if your so-called performance<br />enhancers have not had a...
735659 738582 successful human trial by that date,
739397 740718 I'm gonna pull your funding.
741186 742607 I'm going to give it to them.
745360 746876 Gentlemen. Ladies.
752314 754385 And the Lord said, Let there be light.
754409 755552 And voil√†!
756114 757184 There is light.
757981 760141 Forty soft, glowing watts of it.
760230 762635 Good boy. God will be thrilled.
762838 764260 Just don't fall on your ass.
765397 767429 I'm already on my ass, May.
768039 770927 When the plant's senior electrician<br />is laid off after...
771186 774052 after 35 years,<br />what else would you call it?
774076 775656 I am on my ass.
775681 777304 Hand me that dish. The green one.
777991 780957 The corporation is<br />downsizing the people and...
781355 782728 upsizing their profits.
783480 785796 Ben, you'll get<br />another job somewhere.
787524 788523 Well...
788777 790398 let's look in the paper and see.
791439 793638 There are the want ads.<br />What do we got here?
794295 795449 Computer...
796230 797787 Computer salesman,
797811 800137 computer engineer, computer analyst.
800162 803250 My Lord, even the computers<br />need analysts these days.
804188 805718 May, I'm 68 years old.
805742 809479 I'm too old for computers and<br />besides, I have a family to provide for.
809689 810884 I love you.
811116 812563 And Peter loves you.
812814 816063 You're the most responsible man<br />I've ever known.
816314 817969 We've been down-and-out before.
817993 819827 But somehow, we survived.
820178 821177 Yeah.
821856 822885 Hi, sweetie.
822909 823908 You're just...
824330 826146 Just in time for dinner.
826355 827052 Hey.
827076 828896 How you doing, buddy?<br />How was the field trip?
829064 831054 I don't feel well.<br />I'm gonna go to sleep.
831884 832934 You won't have a bite?
832959 834495 No thanks. Had a bite.
834879 837103 Did, did you get some pictures, Peter?
838144 840123 I gotta crash. Everything's fine.
842230 843291 What's that all about?
865064 867271 In this recombination lab,
867439 872063 we use synthesized transfer RNA<br />to encode an entirely new genome
872272 875456 combining the genetic<br />information from all three spiders
875522 879827 into these 15 genetically<br />designed super-spiders.
894772 895969 Dr. Osborn, please.
896332 898486 The performance enhancers aren't ready.
898897 901151 The data just doesn't justify this test.
902397 904134 Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
904547 905897 We can't do this.
906230 907947 Don't be a coward.
908897 911479 Risks are part of laboratory science.
911689 912794 Let me reschedule,
913117 915396 with a proper medical staff<br />and a volunteer.
915489 917760 I mean if you just give me two weeks.<br />Two weeks?
918252 919205 In two weeks,
919230 922462 we'll have lost the contract<br />to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.
922771 923677 Sometimes,
923701 925420 you gotta do things yourself.
925814 927677 Get me the Promachloraperazine.
927977 928755 For what?
928780 931745 It begins catalyzation, when<br />the vapor hits the bloodstream.
935314 937069 40,000 years of evolution
937094 940518 and we've barely even tapped<br />the vastness of human potential.
955143 956260 That's cold.
1014731 1015730 Norman?
1020230 1021229 Norman!
1022595 1023594 Norman!
1032098 1033097 My God.
1035064 1036063 Oh my God!
1036663 1037662 Norman?
1038856 1040604 My God, Norman!
1043088 1044087 Norman!
1057355 1058813 Back to formula?
1093454 1094453 Weird.
1105981 1107354 Peter?<br />Yeah?
1107564 1108821 Are you alright?
1111230 1112229 I'm fine.
1113397 1115271 Any better this morning?<br />Any change?
1115439 1116438 Change?
1117814 1118813 Yep.
1119176 1119872 Big change.
1119897 1121134 Well, hurry up.
1121321 1122552 You're gonna be late.
1122693 1123692 Right.
1142272 1143271 Ok.
1147689 1149052 Goodness me!
1149076 1150075 Jeez.
1150722 1152290 I thought you were sick.
1152689 1154022 I got better.<br />You see?
1154047 1155010 Bye, guys.
1155034 1157235 You haven't eaten anything.<br />Have you got your lunch money?
1157259 1157966 Yeah, I got it.
1157991 1161094 Hey, Michelangelo, don't forget, we're<br />painting the kitchen right after school.
1161117 1162760 You got it?<br />Sure thing, Uncle Ben.
1163220 1164219 Don't start without me.
1164244 1165608 And don't start up with me.
1167939 1168938 Teenagers.
1169167 1171172 Raging hormones.<br />They never change.
1172992 1174370 Mary jane talk to me!
1174395 1175950 You're trash!<br />You're always gonna be trash!
1175974 1176886 Just like her!
1176911 1178791 I have to go to school.<br />Who's stopping you?
1197689 1198688 Hi, MJ.
1200230 1201229 Hey, MJ.
1201981 1203969 I don't know if you realize this,<br />but we've...
1204900 1207770 we've been neighbors since I was 6,<br />and I was wondering if maybe...
1208599 1210205 we could get together sometime?<br />Hey M.J?
1210230 1211424 I got the car. Hop in.
1211449 1212688 Maybe do something fun?<br />Hi guys!
1213141 1214686 Or I don't know.<br />Come on.
1214711 1217459 I thought it'd be time<br />to get to know each other.
1218856 1219855 Or not.
1225564 1227491 Sorry Parker, the bus is full!<br />Hey!
1228475 1229474 Hey!
1229647 1231620 Stop the bus!<br />Catch a cab!
1232646 1233707 Tell him to stop.
1235064 1236494 Check him out!<br />Dork!
1259522 1260521 Dad!
1261230 1261677 Dad!
1261802 1262801 Are you alright?
1263939 1264938 Harry.
1268564 1270084 What are you doing on the floor?
1270622 1271660 I don't know.
1272897 1274212 Have you been there all night?
1277230 1278479 Last night I was...
1280814 1281813 What?
1283314 1285179 I don't remember.<br />Mr. Osborn?
1285230 1287302 Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.
1287772 1289052 Sorry, my father's not feeling well.
1289076 1290301 Mr. Osborn...
1290728 1291962 Dr. Stromm is dead.
1292204 1293203 What?
1293292 1295176 They found his body<br />this morning in the lab.
1295834 1297030 He's been murdered, sir.
1297167 1298343 What are you talking about?
1298565 1300188 And the flight suit and the glider...
1300689 1301468 What about it?
1301492 1302771 It's been stolen, sir.
1328689 1329915 Great reflexes!
1331314 1331969 Thanks.
1331993 1333137 No problem.
1334564 1335563 Hey you...
1335641 1336552 have blue eyes.
1336576 1338479 I... I didn't notice without your glasses.
1339230 1340659 You just get contacts?
1347647 1348646 Well,
1348728 1349727 see you.
1391564 1392635 What happened?
1393241 1394326 He's freaking weird.
1395522 1396896 Did you see that?
1398480 1399479 Parker?
1432023 1434061 It's a fight!<br />Think you're pretty funny, don't you freak?
1434085 1435677 Flash, it was just an accident.
1435701 1437664 My fist breaking your<br />teeth, that's the accident.
1437689 1439094 Come on Flash, stop.
1439117 1440396 I don't wanna fight you, Flash.
1440421 1441843 I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.
1442108 1443120 Kick his ass.
1463230 1464271 Help him, Harry.
1469230 1470420 How'd he do that?
1471731 1472730 Which one?
1473230 1474229 He's all yours, man.
1490105 1491467 Flash, get up!
1493439 1495487 Jesus Parker, you are a freak.
1497147 1499207 Peter, that was amazing.
1500897 1502426 I'm out of here. Come on.
1505931 1506930 Peter.
1607801 1608800 Go, web!
1610605 1611604 Fly.
1613814 1615168 Up, up and away, web.
1617498 1618497 Shazam!
1619319 1619969 Go!
1620144 1620652 Go!
1620897 1621924 Go, web, go!
1655814 1656875 Tallyho.
1701439 1703857 Is she back with the beer yet?<br />What?
1704230 1705479 Come here, bring me some beer!
1705689 1707010 Get up off your ass!
1707034 1708229 I paid for beer...
1708254 1709753 Stop yelling!<br />Stop it!
1709923 1711301 You're as stupid as your mother.
1711325 1712324 Get away from me!
1712564 1714146 You are drunk, do you know that?
1714314 1716023 Where's she going?<br />Where you going?
1716048 1717047 Where you going?
1717162 1718385 Stop, look!
1718409 1719718 These dishes are not done.
1719742 1721271 Somebody's gotta do the dishes!
1721480 1723218 Why don't you do them?
1723242 1725624 Get in here little girl<br />and you do the dishes, now!
1725679 1728863 You do them. They're yours, anyway.<br />I'm going out!
1729314 1730510 Were you listening to that?
1730534 1731533 No.
1732147 1733885 Well I heard, but I was just...
1734041 1735528 taking out the trash.
1735564 1737041 I guess you can always hear us.
1737543 1738160 Well,
1738543 1739968 everybody shouts.
1741143 1742392 Your aunt and uncle don't.
1743064 1745444 They can scream<br />pretty good sometimes.
1747564 1748207 Listen,
1748576 1750010 MJ, about today
1750863 1751998 at school with Flash...
1752023 1753461 You really freaked us out.
1753856 1754855 I'm sorry.
1755023 1756022 Is he ok?
1756397 1758974 He's just happy you didn't give him<br />a black eye for graduation.
1763439 1765163 So where are you going<br />after you graduate?
1768761 1769760 I...
1771397 1773162 I wanna move into the city.
1774605 1775885 And hopefully...
1776346 1777552 get a job as a...
1778187 1779186 photographer.
1779634 1781192 Work my way through college.
1783397 1784396 What about you?
1784897 1786278 Headed for the city too.
1787605 1789447 Can't wait to get out of here.
1791023 1792022 I wanna...
1793772 1794771 What?
1798105 1799104 No, come on.
1799754 1800753 Try me.
1801272 1802271 I wanna...
1803897 1804896 Act...
1806397 1807396 on stage.
1808397 1809396 Really?
1810605 1811972 That's perfect.
1813064 1815670 You were awesome<br />in all the school plays.
1815939 1816635 Really?
1816659 1817658 Yeah.
1818439 1821438 I cried like a baby<br />when you played Cinderella.
1821889 1823466 Peter, that was first grade.
1824488 1825487 Well...
1826537 1827579 even so.
1829147 1830349 Sometimes...
1831897 1832933 you know people.
1834731 1835760 You can just...
1836204 1837359 see what's coming.
1841397 1843049 What do you see coming for you?
1846551 1847637 I don't know.
1850731 1851760 Whatever it is,
1852634 1854513 it's something I never felt before.
1858910 1859909 And...
1860330 1861438 what for me?
1861861 1862860 For you?
1864728 1866301 You're gonna light up Broadway.
1869064 1870063 You know,
1874678 1876354 you're taller than you look.
1877564 1878563 I hunch.
1881355 1882354 Don't.
1886397 1887396 Hey, MJ!
1887606 1889956 Come take a ride<br />in my new birthday present.
1891023 1892022 Come on!
1893064 1894069 I gotta go.
1895303 1896302 Bye.
1897397 1900063 My God, it's gorgeous!<br />Yeah, right?
1900230 1901836 Look at it!<br />Hop in.
1902397 1904366 Oh my God! What a cool car!
1904897 1905896 Pretty tight?
1906897 1908718 Wait untill you hear the sound system.
1908742 1910789 Hey, don't scratch the leather.
1912731 1913730 Cool car.
2004294 2005293 Peter?
2006856 2009081 What's... What's going on in there?
2009105 2010134 I'm exercising.
2010158 2011443 I'm not dressed, Aunt May.
2011795 2012510 Well,
2012793 2014862 you're acting so strangely, Peter.
2015856 2017288 Ok. Thanks.
2048731 2049802 Something's bothering him.
2050052 2052063 Maybe he's too embarrassed<br />to tell me what it is.
2052230 2053349 Maybe I'm too embarrassed...
2053820 2055015 to ask him.
2055689 2057262 I just don't know anymore.
2058147 2060556 I'm going to the downtown library.<br />I'll see you later.
2060581 2061426 Yeah, wait Pete.
2061450 2063094 I'll drive you there, buddy.
2063117 2064137 No, I'll take the train.
2064162 2065593 No, no, no. I need the exercise.<br />Go on.
2065617 2066879 Go, go, go, go.
2078504 2080094 Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.<br />No, wait a minute.
2080117 2081961 Peter we need... we need to talk.
2082355 2083552 We can talk later.
2083921 2085177 Well, we can talk now.
2086121 2087143 If you let me.
2087605 2089813 What do we have to talk about?<br />Why now?
2089981 2091997 Because we haven't talked<br />at all for so long
2092022 2094244 your Aunt May and I don't<br />even know who you are anymore.
2094283 2095900 You shirk your chores.
2096274 2099342 You have all those weird experiments<br />in your room.
2099912 2103189 You start fights at school, you know.<br />I didn't start that fight, I told you that.
2103536 2105010 Well, you sure as hell finished it.
2105351 2107113 What was I supposed to do, run away?<br />No.
2107138 2109043 No, you're not supposed<br />to run away, but...
2110064 2110927 Pete, look.
2110951 2111843 You're changing.
2111867 2114646 I know, I went through exactly<br />the same thing at your age.
2114814 2116191 No. Not exactly.
2116670 2117669 Peter...
2118188 2120679 these are the years<br />when a man changes
2120907 2124052 into the man he's gonna<br />become the rest of his life.
2125401 2127692 Just be careful who you change into.
2129856 2131801 This guy, Flash Thompson.
2132118 2134354 He probably deserved what happened.
2134897 2137028 But just because you can beat him up,
2138064 2139507 doesn't give you the right to.
2140889 2141888 Remember,
2142191 2143426 with great power,
2143722 2145876 comes great responsibility.
2146814 2149718 Are you afraid that I'm gonna<br />turn into some kind of criminal?
2150192 2151723 Quit worrying about me, ok?
2151748 2152927 Something's different.
2152951 2154094 I'll figure it out.
2154117 2155670 Stop lecturing me, please.
2155694 2157969 I don't mean to lecture,<br />I don't mean to preach.
2158504 2160039 And I know I'm not your father...
2160064 2161719 Then stop pretending to be!
2166981 2167980 Right.
2171188 2172598 I'll pick you up here at 10.
2204480 2211551 Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
2214491 2216260 One, two, three.
2216550 2218166 That's it!<br />Who's the man?
2218362 2222647 Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
2223064 2225271 Ladies and gentlemen...
2225439 2229980 Give it up for Bone Saw McGraw!
2233064 2235930 For $3000,
2236897 2240012 is there no one here<br />man enough to stay in the ring
2240037 2245085 for three minutes<br />with this titan of testosterone?
2248144 2249307 Who?
2250438 2251664 I know who.
2252397 2257187 The Flying Dutchman!
2257655 2258654 Next.
2259814 2262186 There's no featherweight<br />division here, small fry.
2262534 2263185 . Next.
2263272 2264504 No, no. Sign me up.
2265522 2266521 Ok.
2267096 2269122 You understand<br />the NYWL is not responsible
2269147 2270612 for any injury you may and
2270636 2273229 probably will sustain while<br />participating in said event?
2273397 2275676 And you are indeed participating<br />under your own free will?
2275814 2276813 Yes.
2277064 2278260 Down the hall to the ramp.
2278284 2279510 May God be with you.
2280100 2281099 Next.
2283439 2285405 Told you! Told you!
2285897 2288004 Winner!
2288029 2289362 Next victim!
2290981 2293443 Are you ready for more?
2294981 2298563 Bone Saw is ready!
2300981 2305376 Will the next victim please<br />enter the arena at this time?
2305856 2309052 If he can withstand just three minutes<br />in the cage
2309076 2313677 with Bone Saw McGraw,<br />the sum of $3000
2313701 2315187 will be paid to...
2316064 2317063 What's your name, kid?
2317408 2318649 The Human Spider.
2319647 2322022 The Human Spider, that's it?<br />That's the best you got?
2322188 2322802 Yeah.
2322826 2324077 That sucks.
2324480 2328980 The sum of $3000 will be paid to...
2329147 2330343 the terrifying,
2330367 2332396 the deadly,
2332647 2336110 the amazing Spider-Man!
2338230 2340855 My name's The Human Spider.<br />I don't care, get out there.
2340880 2343592 No, he got my name wrong.<br />Get out there, you moron.
2346232 2349450 Bone Saw will eat you up<br />and spit you out, little man.
2349475 2351354 I hope you brought<br />your mommy with you.
2351379 2354514 We'll break you!<br />You'll need someone to cry to.
2356355 2360877 I'm gonna rip all eight of your<br />feeble legs off one by one!
2361981 2364022 Oh my God!
2364230 2365268 My legs!
2366023 2368254 God. I can't feel my legs.
2368723 2376715 Kill! Kill! Kill!
2380731 2381938 Cage!
2391272 2392730 Hello? Guys?
2393772 2398730 Will the guards please lock<br />the cage doors at this time?
2399439 2400438 Hey, listen.
2400719 2403489 This is some kind of mistake.<br />I didn't sign up for a cage match!
2403898 2404593 Hey!
2404865 2406343 Unlock the thing!
2406570 2407636 Take the chain off!
2407675 2409181 Hey, freak show!
2409605 2411483 You're going, nowhere.
2412397 2414317 I got you for three minutes.
2414876 2417166 Three minutes of playtime.
2423856 2426971 What are you doing up there?<br />Staying away from you.
2427522 2428760 That's a cute outfit.
2428784 2430104 Did your husband give it to you?
2437230 2438288 Finish him off!
2445939 2447032 Smash him!
2454647 2456248 Hit him!<br />Harder!
2458397 2460267 Kick his spider ass!
2462731 2463896 Hit him!
2477314 2479104 One, two, three!
2479314 2480385 That's it! That's it!
2481405 2482356 Winner!
2482381 2484802 Ladies and gentlemen, give it up<br />for the new champion,
2484880 2487517 Spider-Man!
2488230 2492918 Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!
2493252 2495808 Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!
2504731 2505873 Now get out of here.
2508023 2509218 A hundred bucks?
2509242 2510855 The ad said 3000.
2511064 2512818 Well, check it again, webhead.
2513605 2515010 It said three grand,
2515267 2517358 for three minutes.<br />And you pinned him in two.
2517689 2520660 For that, I give you 100<br />and you're lucky to get that.
2521230 2522604 I need that money.
2523064 2525352 I missed the part<br />where that's my problem.
2534230 2535802 Hey, what the hell?
2535951 2537316 Put the money in the bag.
2539279 2540278 Hurry up!
2547064 2549312 Hey! He stole the gate!
2549501 2550803 Stop that guy!
2551782 2553913 Stop him! He's got my money!
2554314 2555313 Thanks.
2556731 2559010 What the hell's the matter with you?<br />You let him go!
2559397 2561604 Cut him off in the lobby<br />and call the cops!
2561772 2563635 You could've taken that guy apart.
2563659 2565813 Now he's gonna get away<br />with my money.
2565981 2567990 I missed the part<br />where that's my problem.
2587731 2589369 Sir, you gotta get back.<br />Get back.
2589435 2591214 I can't see anything.<br />What happened?
2591897 2593054 Old dude, man.
2593480 2595103 Come on folks. Keep moving, please.
2595423 2596984 Please, keep moving. Let's go!
2597814 2600225 What happened?<br />Someone got hurt.
2603023 2603760 Excuse me.
2603784 2605593 Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
2605617 2606616 Stay back.
2606731 2608563 Hey, stay back! Stay back!<br />That's my uncle!
2610731 2611677 What happened?
2611701 2613173 Carjacker. He's been shot.
2613300 2615498 But we just called the paramedics.<br />They're on their way.
2617230 2618229 Uncle Ben?
2619522 2620521 Uncle Ben.
2624772 2625771 Uncle Ben?
2629731 2630730 Peter.
2632105 2633330 I'm here, Uncle Ben.
2639522 2640521 Peter.
2662689 2664094 They got the shooter.
2664117 2665858 He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.
2665939 2667635 We got three cars in pursuit.
2667885 2670280 Alright. Folks come on.<br />Come up. Move back.
2827605 2829604 Get a unit to the rear!
2832564 2834104 I got the back!
2847023 2848161 Who's there?
2874605 2875510 Don't hurt me.
2875534 2876718 Just give me a chance.
2876742 2877922 Just give me a chance!
2877991 2879094 What about my uncle?
2879117 2880593 Did you give him a chance?
2881020 2882019 Did you?
2882477 2883476 Answer me!
2887397 2889111 Stop that guy!
2894064 2895063 Thanks.
2905814 2906813 See you.
2928564 2929385 Freeze!
2929409 2931631 We've got the place<br />completely surrounded.
2974480 2975838 No. My God.
2979023 2980755 No.<br />My God. No!
2991064 2992134 Good evening General.
2992704 2993703 Good to see you.
2994814 2997688 Our exoskeleton's got<br />real firepower, General Slocum.
2997856 3001891 Well, if it does what you say it can,<br />I'll sign that contract tomorrow.
3004480 3007570 He's clear, let's go!<br />I assume you're confident about this test?
3007595 3008385 Absolutely.
3008409 3010060 Captain Curtis is our top pilot.
3010731 3013251 Now, what about<br />your commitment to OSCORP?
3013647 3017434 Nothing would please me more than<br />to put Norman Osborn out of business.
3019897 3021094 Preflight complete.
3021703 3022702 Mark.
3027064 3029803 We are picking up an<br />unidentified object, closing fast.
3029856 3030938 What the hell is that?
3031105 3032104 Can you see anything?
3033064 3034063 Oh my God!
3044689 3045510 Say chess.
3045534 3046830 Chess!
3048064 3049063 Peter!
3050147 3050927 Darling.
3050951 3054063 I'm so proud of you.<br />You looked so handsome up there.
3054230 3054885 Pete?
3054909 3058313 Good news. My father got the place<br />in New York, so we're all set this fall.
3058480 3060063 That's great.<br />You made it.
3062647 3064917 It's not the first time<br />I've been proven wrong.
3067564 3069271 Congratulations.<br />Thanks, Dad.
3070230 3071885 Peter, the science award.
3072089 3073122 That's terrific.
3073147 3074146 Yeah.
3077397 3079813 I know this has been<br />a difficult time for you
3080939 3083184 but I want you to try to enjoy this day.
3084397 3085510 Commencement.
3086105 3087468 The end of one thing.
3088250 3089631 The start of something new.
3092064 3093468 I don't want to be with you anymore.
3093492 3095224 Here's your ring.
3096605 3097979 You know what? Whatever.
3099023 3100022 Your loss.
3101188 3102593 You're like a brother to Harry.
3102981 3104222 That makes you family.
3104975 3106843 And if you ever need anything just...
3107023 3108022 give me a call.
3121268 3122267 Can I...
3122605 3123898 Can I fix you something?
3125023 3126022 No, thanks.
3171230 3172762 I missed him a lot today.
3175944 3176943 I know.
3179272 3180380 I miss him too.
3182856 3184563 But he was there.
3188355 3190802 I can't help thinking about...
3191959 3193699 the last thing I said to him.
3193778 3195885 He tried to tell me something<br />important,
3196391 3198178 and I threw it in his face.
3200522 3201909 You loved him
3204272 3205735 and he loved you.
3207397 3209989 He never doubted<br />the man you'd grow into.
3211230 3213501 How you were meant for great things.
3215230 3216731 You won't disappoint him.
3251064 3252260 With great power...
3252921 3254895 comes great responsibility.
3255397 3256593 Remember that, Pete.
3257039 3258188 Remember that.
3268605 3269637 Hurry up!
3282230 3283310 This is not a man.
3283335 3285933 My brother saw him building a<br />nest in the Lincoln Center Fountain.
3286147 3287426 I think he's human,
3287450 3289425 I think he's a man.<br />Could be a woman.
3293344 3294176 Bobby.
3294200 3295551 Get a load of this!
3299443 3301317 He throws up his hands,<br />ropes come out,
3301564 3303662 and he climbs up<br />the ropes like a spider web.
3303897 3305802 I see the web and it's his signature,
3305826 3308163 and I know Spider-Man was here.
3308188 3309635 The guy protects us, you know?
3309659 3310813 He protects the people.
3310981 3313730 Some kind of freakyloo or something.<br />Wackadoo.
3313897 3315896 He stinks and I don't like him.
3316647 3317716 Don't move, lady!
3326314 3327426 Guy with eight hands.
3327955 3329063 Sounds hot.
3329131 3331255 He has those tights<br />and that tight little...
3347314 3348885 Who is Spider-Man?
3348909 3350605 He's a criminal, that's who he is!
3351230 3352094 A vigilante.
3352117 3353260 A public menace.
3353284 3355017 What's he doing on my front page?
3355196 3357490 Mr. Jameson, your wife's on line one.<br />She needs to know if you...
3357514 3358957 Mr. Jameson, there's a page six problem.
3358981 3360628 We have a page one problem. Shut up.
3360759 3362299 Well?<br />He's news.
3362814 3365373 They're really important clients.<br />They can't wait. They're about to.
3365397 3367802 He pulled six people off that subway car.
3367826 3369479 Sure, from a wreck he probably caused.
3369647 3371456 Something goes wrong<br />and this creepy crawler is there.
3371480 3373813 Look at that. He's fleeing the scene!<br />What's that tell ya?
3373981 3376730 He's not fleeing, he's probably<br />going to save somebody else.
3376758 3378039 He's a hero!
3378064 3379222 Then why does he wear a mask?
3379996 3381005 What's he got to hide?
3381064 3384023 She just needs to know if you want the<br />chintz or the chenille in the dining room.
3384047 3385094 Whichever one's cheaper.
3385117 3386747 Mr. Jameson, it's like this.
3386897 3388362 We double-booked page six.
3388397 3390731 See, so both Macy's and Conway's<br />both have three quarters...
3390755 3392718 We sold out four printings.
3393588 3394330 Sold out?
3394355 3395604 Every copy.
3396117 3398688 Tomorrow morning, Spider-Man,<br />page one with a decent picture this time.
3398712 3400453 Move Conway to page 7.<br />There's a problem with page 7...
3400477 3403040 And make it page eight, get him<br />10 percent off. Make it five percent.
3403064 3404479 That can't be done.<br />Get outta here!
3404939 3406989 The problem is,<br />we don't have a decent picture.
3407014 3409865 Eddie's been on it for weeks,<br />we can barely get a glimpse of him.
3410247 3411425 What is he, shy?
3412230 3416106 If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a<br />thong, we can surely get a picture with this weirdo.
3416287 3417468 Put an ad on the front page.
3417570 3419315 Cash money for a picture of Spider-Man.
3419981 3421260 He doesn't wanna be famous?
3421813 3423438 I'll make him infamous!
3434647 3435646 Hey!
3435897 3436896 Buzz off.
3438023 3439551 MJ, it's me, Peter.
3439575 3440574 Hi!
3440622 3441621 Hey.
3442689 3443856 What are you doing around here?
3443880 3446341 I'm begging for a job.<br />How about you?
3448064 3449510 I'm headed to an audition.
3449534 3450533 An audition?
3450868 3451968 So you're acting now?
3452087 3453086 Yeah.
3453349 3454468 I work steady.
3454942 3457063 In fact, I just got off a job.
3457324 3458490 That's great, MJ!
3458981 3460010 You're doing it!
3460197 3461875 You're living your dream!<br />Hey, glamour girl!
3461899 3463980 Yeah.<br />Your drawer was short $6!
3464147 3465301 Next time that happens,
3465325 3466771 I'mma take it out of your check.
3467856 3469343 Excuse me, Miss Watson?
3469594 3470760 I'm talking to you!
3470784 3471783 Hey!
3471856 3474074 Yes, Enrique! Ok? I get you.
3474099 3475760 Well, it better not happen<br />no more, you hear me?
3475784 3477390 Don't roll your eyes at me.
3485397 3486405 Some dream?
3487981 3489854 It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
3490772 3491843 Don't tell Harry.
3491945 3493054 Don't tell Harry?
3493981 3495510 Aren't you guys living together?
3495855 3497401 We're going out. Didn't he tell you?
3498981 3500024 Yeah. Right.
3500814 3503896 I think he'd hate the idea<br />of my waiting tables.
3504064 3505677 He'd think it was low or something.
3505979 3507010 It's not low.
3507359 3508479 You have a job.
3508814 3509984 You know Harry...
3510866 3513146 doesn't live on a little place<br />I like to call Earth.
3514647 3516485 No, I guess not.
3521564 3522751 Thanks, Pete.
3524564 3525966 We should catch up sometime.
3530587 3532194 Let's get some lunch some evening.
3534480 3535635 Well I...
3535822 3538866 I'll come by and have some of your<br />Moondance coffee some day.
3539188 3540468 And I won't tell Harry.
3540492 3541896 No, don't tell Harry.
3542072 3543071 I won't!
3545480 3546852 I won't tell Harry.
3558522 3560332 Timing's perfect. Hey.
3561188 3562468 Five new contracts.
3562492 3563587 It'll be great.
3566832 3569336 Storming Norman's<br />making his weekly inspection.
3570230 3571990 Spent half of it on the phone.
3573001 3575385 Look, man, I'm glad you're here.<br />I need your help.
3575409 3576792 I'm really lost here.
3578604 3579625 Are you alright?
3581287 3582468 You look like you just got,
3582492 3584331 second place in the science fair.
3584503 3585611 No I...
3587087 3589855 I was late for work<br />and Dr. Connors fired me.
3589952 3591012 You were late again?
3592230 3593229 I don't get it.
3593962 3595360 Wait, where do you go all the time?
3596355 3597354 Around.
3597889 3598888 Peter Parker.
3599814 3601551 Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
3601787 3602525 Who's that?
3602550 3604646 This mystery girl Harry's been dating.<br />Dad.
3605939 3607604 When do I get to meet her?<br />Dad.
3607951 3609901 Well sorry, Harry hasn't mentioned her.
3613939 3615843 Hey Pete, you're probably looking for a...
3616052 3617239 a job now, right?
3617397 3618966 Dad, maybe you can help him out.
3620397 3623551 No I... I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.<br />It's no problem.
3623676 3624831 I'll make a few calls.
3624856 3626385 No, I couldn't accept it, sir.
3626409 3629146 I like to earn what I get.<br />I can find my own work.
3629355 3630354 I respect that.
3631833 3633773 You want to make<br />it on your own steam.
3634522 3635591 That's great.
3636731 3638518 What other skills do you have, Parker?
3639272 3641643 I was thinking of something in photography.
3644355 3645354 Hello.
3647522 3648521 Let's go!
3648690 3649689 Move it!
3650981 3652018 Watch the street!
3668064 3669063 Cheese!
3678355 3679355 They're crap.
3679856 3680855 Crap.
3680893 3682524 Crap. Megacrap.
3683023 3684551 I'll give you $200 for all of them.
3684760 3686214 That seems a little low.
3686397 3687643 Take them somewhere else, then.
3688314 3691111 Sir, your wife says the tile you<br />ordered for the foyer is out of stock.
3691381 3692820 Tell her we'll just put a rug there.
3693023 3693843 Sit down.
3693867 3694866 Give me that.
3696564 3697635 Give you 300.
3697659 3699104 That's the standard freelance fee.
3699272 3701218 Tear up page one.<br />Run that photo instead.
3701242 3702002 Headline?
3702040 3703927 Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?
3703951 3705330 Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos.
3705355 3706176 Menace?
3706200 3708539 He was protecting that armoured...<br />Tell you what, Atticus.
3708564 3710176 You take the pictures,<br />I'll make up the headlines. Ok?
3710200 3711373 Alright? That ok with you?
3711517 3712927 Yes, sir.<br />Goody.
3713897 3715176 Give this to the girl up front.
3715200 3716558 She'll see you get paid.
3717592 3718718 I'd like a job, sir.
3718742 3720468 No jobs. Freelance.
3720684 3722411 Best thing in the world for a kid your age.
3722689 3725389 You bring me some more shots<br />of that newspaper-selling clown,
3725414 3726853 maybe I'll take them off your hands.
3727188 3728468 But I never said you have a job.
3729097 3730096 Meat.
3730314 3731802 I'll send you a nice box<br />of Christmas meat,
3731826 3733094 best I can do. Get outta here.
3733117 3734604 Bring me more photos.
3736188 3737532 Hi.<br />Hi.
3737605 3740014 Mr. Jameson told me<br />to give that to you.
3742105 3743635 Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
3743659 3744774 Thank you.
3745772 3747146 I'm Peter Parker.
3749647 3750940 I'm a photographer.
3752605 3753604 Yes.
3753656 3754907 I can see that.
3762856 3764482 As of today,
3764856 3766301 OSCORP lndustries,
3766457 3768987 has surpassed Quest Aerospace
3769105 3772381 as the principal supplier<br />to the United States military.
3773689 3775940 In short, ladies and gentlemen<br />of the board...
3776689 3778010 costs are down,
3778546 3779710 revenues are up,
3780105 3781134 and our stock,
3781395 3782721 has never been higher.
3783105 3784468 Wonderful news Norman.
3784492 3785491 Wonderful.
3785672 3787590 In fact, it's the reason<br />for selling the company.
3788605 3789269 What?
3789391 3792510 Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing<br />in the wake of the bombing.
3793161 3794160 Expanding.
3795188 3797563 They made a tender offer<br />we can't ignore.
3798105 3799271 Why wasn't I told?
3799439 3801885 Last thing they want<br />is a power struggle,
3802223 3803675 with entrenched management.
3804074 3805978 The deal is off if you come with it.
3806272 3809154 The board expects<br />your resignation in 30 days.
3809974 3811932 You can't do this to me.
3814873 3816795 I started this company.
3818355 3820556 You know how much I sacrificed?
3824605 3825604 Max.
3825742 3827069 Please.<br />Norman,
3827450 3829511 the board is unanimous.
3830605 3833866 We're announcing the sale<br />after the World Unity Festival.
3834772 3835817 I'm sorry.
3837272 3838666 You're out, Norman.
3849272 3850395 Am I?
3854981 3858021 Welcome to OSCORP lndustries<br />Unity Day Festival!
3858064 3860725 Let's hear it for Macy Gray.
3897897 3898896 MJ,
3899863 3901396 why didn't you wear the black dress?
3902439 3904510 Just, I wanted to impress my father.
3904920 3906104 He loves black.
3906272 3908635 Well, maybe he'll be impressed<br />no matter what.
3909617 3910888 You think I'm pretty.
3911355 3912762 I think you're beautiful.
3926522 3927718 MJ, would you do me a favor?
3927742 3929982 I... forgot my drink inside.<br />Come on.
3939981 3941343 Hi, Mr. Fargas.
3941367 3942366 Harry.
3943188 3944760 Have you seen my father around?
3945701 3948526 Well, I'm not sure if he's coming today.
3960355 3961385 What is that?
3961768 3963119 Must be new this year.
3968144 3969143 What is that?
3969224 3970306 That's our glider!
3981550 3983008 What the hell was that?
4011314 4012730 Code three! Code three!
4028731 4031112 Oh my God! Harry!<br />MJ!
4036856 4039329 Harry! Help me! Harry!
4045867 4047616 Out, am I?
4052564 4053593 Mary Jane!
4053617 4054616 Harry!
4057772 4059510 Hello, my dear.
4060647 4061841 It's Spider-Man!
4073981 4075010 Come on, move, kid.
4075034 4076033 Billy!
4079439 4081363 Somebody help him!
4081981 4083229 No!
4085023 4086022 Mommy!
4088564 4089677 Hold it right there!
4089701 4090929 I surrender.
4091035 4091885 Boy.
4091910 4092909 Hold it right there!
4099771 4100771 Impressive.
4124897 4125986 Mary Jane!
4126010 4127134 Help!
4127158 4128596 Someone please help me!
4153689 4154688 Hold on!
4156397 4157396 Watch out!
4166522 4168094 We'll meet again,
4168445 4169987 Spider-Man!
4171897 4173008 Hold on, Mary Jane!
4215772 4216426 Well,
4216591 4218004 beats taking the subway.
4218647 4220907 Don't mind us.<br />She just needs to use the elevator.
4221829 4222828 Wait.
4223355 4224354 Who are you?
4224772 4226134 You know who I am.
4226306 4227305 I do?
4227517 4229264 Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
4241897 4242896 Incredible?
4243938 4245290 What do you mean he's incredible?
4246993 4248551 No. Alright, wait.
4248575 4249966 Stay there. I'm gonna come over.
4251272 4252485 No, I'm gonna come o...
4253272 4254343 Alright. Fine.
4254367 4256349 Fine, will you call me in the morning,<br />and, and...
4256897 4258511 we'll go and have breakfast and...
4259609 4261274 I wanna buy you something.
4262605 4264633 Because I want to.<br />It'll make you feel better.
4266856 4267855 Ok.
4268105 4269104 And...
4269366 4270626 what do you mean, incredible?
4273355 4274343 Alright. I'm sorry.
4274367 4275366 Sleep tight.
4275897 4277199 Don't let the bedbugs...
4283397 4284593 She's alright.<br />She's...
4284617 4286136 just a little rattled.
4287798 4290592 Look Pete, I should have<br />told you about us.
4293064 4294845 But you should know<br />I'm crazy about her.
4295856 4297636 It's just you know,<br />you never made a move.
4299981 4300980 You're right.
4302397 4303396 I didn't.
4307834 4309530 I'm gonna get some rest.
4311564 4313276 I'm gonna stay up for a while.
4314897 4316117 What was that thing?
4317230 4318229 I don't know.
4319981 4322141 Whatever it is,<br />somebody has to stop it.
4339230 4340393 Somebody there?
4341147 4342781 Somebody?
4344522 4345567 Who said that?
4346731 4349414 Don't play the innocent with me.
4352522 4354565 You've known all along.
4359188 4360319 Where are you?
4360731 4364401 Follow the cold shiver<br />running down your spine.
4371647 4372658 I'm right here.
4375230 4376419 I don't understand.
4378230 4381196 Did you think it was coincidence?
4381647 4385372 So many good things,<br />all happening for you.
4385448 4386969 All for you,
4387401 4388642 Norman.
4391564 4392563 What do you want?
4393522 4395432 To say what you won't.
4395856 4397956 To do what you can't.
4398564 4399969 To remove...
4400257 4402326 those in your way.
4407105 4408303 The board members.
4410758 4411757 You killed them.
4411897 4413294 We killed them.
4413856 4414855 We?
4415023 4416061 Remember?
4416731 4419396 Your little accident in the laboratory.
4421397 4423022 The performance enhancers.
4423188 4424094 Bingo.
4424117 4425116 Me!
4425744 4427797 Your greatest creation.
4428731 4432018 Bringing you what you've always wanted.
4432689 4435686 Power, beyond your wildest dreams.
4435711 4437653 And it's only the beginning.
4439731 4441259 There's only one...
4442173 4443656 who can stop us.
4444856 4447754 Or imagine if he joined us.
4453147 4454176 Spider-Man.
4454760 4456229 And the Green Goblin.
4456397 4457885 The Green Goblin. You like that?
4457909 4459347 Made it up myself.<br />Mr. Jameson.
4459662 4461509 These weirdos all gotta have a name now.
4461534 4462883 Mr. Jameson, Spider-Ma...
4462908 4463907 Hoffman!<br />Yeah?
4466001 4467969 Call the patent office,<br />copyright the name Green Goblin,
4467993 4469751 I want a quarter every<br />time somebody says it.
4469814 4471198 How about Green Meanie?
4472020 4473969 Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.
4473993 4475373 He was trying to save it. That's slander.
4475397 4477247 It is not. I resent that.
4477731 4478969 Slander is spoken.
4479140 4480272 In print, it's libel.
4480939 4482793 You don't trust anybody,<br />that's your problem.
4483023 4484221 I trust my barber.
4485639 4487263 What are you, his lawyer?<br />Get outta here.
4487314 4489438 Let him sue me,<br />get rich like a normal person.
4489605 4490884 That's what made this country...
4499564 4500593 Jameson,
4500617 4502172 you slime.
4502686 4506259 Who's the photographer<br />who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?
4506397 4508495 I don't know who he is.<br />His stuff comes in the mail.
4508520 4510313 You're lying!<br />I swear.
4510425 4512780 He's the one who can bring me to him.
4512805 4514052 I don't know who he is.
4514076 4515708 You are useless.
4515733 4517456 Set him down tough guy.
4518272 4519697 Speak of the devil!
4519721 4522010 Spider-Man, I knew you two<br />were in this together!
4522034 4522670 I...
4522889 4525675 Hey kiddo, let Mom and Dad<br />talk for a minute, will you?
4525700 4528157 Sleep...
4542772 4544510 Wake up little spider.
4545253 4546252 Wake up.
4546939 4547938 No,
4548272 4549802 you're not dead...
4550137 4551136 yet.
4551564 4553532 Just paralyzed...
4553897 4555280 temporarily.
4556856 4559603 You're an amazing creature, Spider-Man.
4560327 4562898 You and I are not so different.
4563451 4564593 I'm not like you.
4565518 4566784 You're a murderer.
4567064 4568063 Well,
4568399 4569601 to each his own.
4570105 4571635 I chose my path,
4571659 4573227 you chose the way of the hero.
4573731 4576134 And they found you amusing<br />for a while,
4576466 4578043 the people of this city.
4578564 4581553 But the one thing they love<br />more than a hero...
4582023 4583760 is to see a hero fail,
4583784 4584593 fall,
4584617 4585616 die trying.
4586096 4588468 In spite of everything you've done for<br />them,
4588492 4590133 eventually, they will hate you.
4590439 4591438 Why bother?
4592177 4593677 Because it's right.
4594104 4595838 Here's the real truth.
4596897 4599521 There are eight million<br />people in this city.
4600231 4604396 And those teeming masses<br />exist for the sole purpose
4604758 4608563 of lifting the few exceptional<br />people onto their shoulders.
4609059 4610058 You, me,
4610621 4612019 we're exceptional.
4612897 4617563 I could squash you<br />like a bug right now.
4617772 4619677 But I'm offering you a choice.
4620583 4621579 Join me.
4621605 4624991 Imagine what we could<br />accomplish together.
4625397 4627496 What we could create.
4628731 4630361 Or we could destroy.
4631018 4634322 Because the deaths of countless<br />innocents in selfish
4634346 4637182 battle again and again and<br />again until we're both dead.
4637755 4639565 Is that what you want?
4641939 4643835 Think about it, hero.
4656772 4659343 In spite of everything<br />you've done for them,
4659367 4661403 eventually they will hate you.
4671230 4672229 Hey!
4672397 4673301 It's me again.
4673325 4674091 Hey!
4674272 4675433 How was your audition?
4675897 4676927 How'd you know?
4676951 4678492 The hot line. Your mom
4679064 4680599 told my aunt, told me.
4681480 4682898 So you just came by?
4683023 4684468 I was in the neighborhood.
4684492 4686175 Needed to see a friendly face.
4686814 4690521 I took two buses and a cab<br />to get in the neighborhood, but...
4691647 4692714 So how'd it go?
4695314 4697434 They said I needed acting lessons.
4698008 4700232 A soap opera told me<br />I needed acting lessons.
4701981 4703510 Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
4704011 4706052 The sky's the limit, up to $7
4706606 4707844 84 cents.
4708647 4710222 I'd like a cheeseburger.
4711510 4713593 But, I'm going out to dinner with Harry.
4715064 4716063 Come with us.
4716647 4717646 No, thanks.
4718385 4719560 How's it going with...
4721314 4722162 Never mind.
4722187 4723758 That's none of my business.
4724314 4725313 It's not?
4727230 4728448 Why so interested?
4729564 4730563 I'm not.
4731314 4732313 You're not?
4734314 4735802 Well, why would I be?
4735964 4736963 I don't know.
4737244 4738500 Why would you be?
4740981 4742065 I, that's a...
4743310 4744492 I don't know.
4747489 4748933 Sorry you won't come with us.
4752670 4753928 I better run, tiger.
4762962 4764100 Hey, check it out, man.
4765339 4766338 Come on, man.
4770564 4772506 Hey, where you going, baby?<br />Come on!
4791548 4792586 Get off me!
4826225 4827224 Wait!
4832731 4834768 You have a knack<br />for getting in trouble.
4835272 4837218 You have a knack for saving my life.
4837858 4839755 I think I have a superhero stalker.
4839856 4841533 I was in the neighborhood.
4843605 4844604 You are...
4844887 4845886 amazing.
4847188 4848623 Some people don't think so.
4850981 4851980 But you are.
4852535 4853980 Nice to have a fan.
4854731 4856696 Do I get to say thank you this time?
4858814 4859813 Wait.
4928926 4930885 I have to get in there! My baby's in there!
4930910 4932218 My baby's in there! Let me go!
4932242 4933842 I can't let you in there,<br />the roof's about to collapse!
4933866 4935510 Please save my baby!<br />I can't let you in there,
4935534 4937498 Somebody save my baby!<br />The roof's about to collapse!
4937522 4938855 Look! Up there!
4945522 4947313 Save my baby, please!
4970981 4971980 No!
4979856 4981218 It's ok. Your baby's fine.
4981697 4982907 My baby!
4984897 4986510 God bless you, Spider-Man.
4986981 4987933 Bless you.
4987958 4989771 There he's! Don't let him get away!
4989981 4991385 Hold it! Hold it right there!
4991664 4993295 You're under arrest. I'm taking you in.
4993342 4995489 My God, there's<br />somebody still up there!
4997897 4998896 I'm going.
5001188 5002760 I'll be here when you get back.
5002784 5004229 Not coming back, chief.
5004647 5005771 Go! Go!
5014689 5015719 Where are you?
5018403 5019707 Where are you?
5025397 5026685 I'm gonna get you out of here!
5030355 5031354 It's ok.
5038897 5041091 You're pathetically predictable.
5041732 5043331 Like a moth to the flame.
5044439 5046896 What about my generous proposal?
5047939 5049094 Are you in
5049117 5050425 or are you out?
5050981 5052551 It's you who's out, Gobby.
5052843 5053842 Out of your mind.
5054059 5055361 Wrong answer.
5057314 5058313 Great.
5097439 5099636 No one says no to me!
5107564 5109510 MJ, will you stop goofing around?
5109534 5110980 Harry, relax.
5113690 5114730 He's here.
5115522 5116521 Are you ready?
5116872 5117871 Yeah.
5118590 5119927 Aunt May.
5120060 5121364 I'm sorry I'm late.
5121731 5122843 Work was murder.
5123514 5124998 I picked up a fruitcake.
5125023 5126195 Why thank you Mr. Osborn.
5126220 5127500 We're so glad you could come.<br />You look great.
5127524 5128523 Thanks.
5128689 5130638 Who is this lovely young lady?
5131564 5133760 MJ, I'd like you to meet<br />my father, Norman Osborn.
5133784 5135485 Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.
5135510 5136843 Hi.<br />How do you do?
5136867 5138786 I've been looking forward to meeting you.
5138939 5140301 Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
5140325 5142646 Now, where is Peter?
5143025 5145230 He'd better have remembered<br />that cranberry sauce.
5150902 5151677 That's...
5151870 5153329 weird, I didn't know he was here.
5157522 5158521 Peter?
5163750 5164749 Peter?
5167064 5168150 Is that you?
5172201 5173200 Pete?
5174230 5175593 How strange.
5175618 5177048 There's nobody here.
5184856 5186343 Bit of a slob, isn't he?
5186429 5188559 All brilliant men are.
5222037 5223052 Hey, everyone.
5223762 5224552 Peter!
5224577 5226523 Peter!<br />Sorry I'm late, it's a jungle out there.
5226548 5229211 Had to beat an old lady with<br />a stick to get these cranberries.
5230981 5232010 Thank you.
5232034 5233813 Now then, everybody sit down
5234051 5235633 and we can say grace.
5237038 5238037 Parker.
5239105 5240855 Here we go.
5247814 5248927 There we are.
5248951 5250514 It looks delicious.
5250647 5251646 Norman.
5253939 5255360 Will you do the honors?
5267897 5269176 Why Peter,
5269285 5270875 you're bleeding.
5273864 5274863 Yeah.
5275084 5276968 I stepped off a kerb and...
5277409 5279313 got clipped<br />by one of those bike messengers.
5279449 5280859 Well, let me see.
5281230 5282813 Oh my goodness.
5282981 5285296 That looks awful.<br />No, it's nothing.
5285564 5287176 I'll get the first-aid kit.
5287270 5288872 Then we'll say grace.
5288897 5291677 This is the boys' first Thanksgiving<br />in this apartment
5291701 5294223 and we<br />are going to do things properly.
5295147 5297183 How did you say that happened?
5298647 5299739 Bike messenger.
5300564 5301776 Knocked me down.
5307897 5309593 If you'll excuse me I've...
5309796 5311643 got to be going.<br />Wh... Why?
5312480 5313593 Something...
5313994 5315703 has come to my attention.
5316064 5317063 Are you alright?
5317443 5318927 I'm fine, just fine.
5318951 5321283 Thank you, Mrs. Parker.<br />Everyone.
5321647 5322718 Enjoy the fruitcake.
5322898 5323897 Dad!
5325350 5326349 Dad!
5326466 5327465 What are you doing?
5327746 5330282 I plan this whole thing so you can<br />meet MJ and now you have to leave?
5330306 5331312 I've got to go.
5332352 5333843 This girl is important to me.
5333867 5336261 Harry, please. Look at her.
5336623 5340484 Do you think a woman like that's sniffing<br />around because she likes your personality?
5340731 5341730 What are you saying?
5342227 5343768 Your mother was beautiful too.
5343793 5344959 They're all beautiful.
5345230 5349313 Until they're snarling after your trust<br />fund like a pack of ravening wolves.
5349522 5350813 You're wrong about her, Dad.
5351314 5354479 A word to the not-so-wise<br />about your little girlfriend.
5354689 5357354 Do what you need to with her,<br />then broom her fast.
5368981 5370744 Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.
5371689 5372688 You heard?
5373226 5374457 Everyone heard that creep.
5374543 5376259 That creep is my father.
5376283 5378702 Alright, If I'm lucky, I'll<br />become half of what he is.
5378981 5381418 So just keep your mouth shut<br />about stuff you don't understand!
5381443 5383330 Harry Osborn!
5383980 5385259 I'm sorry, Aunt May.
5389067 5392399 Spider-Man is all but invincible.
5392731 5393968 But Parker,
5394640 5396217 we can destroy him.
5396504 5397503 I can't.
5397564 5400389 Betrayal must not be countenanced.
5400814 5401593 Parker...
5401617 5403063 must be educated.
5405868 5406706 What do I do?
5406731 5410534 Instruct him in the matters<br />of loss and pain.
5410981 5412218 Make him suffer.
5412313 5414303 Make him wish he were dead.
5414710 5415563 Yes?
5415731 5417646 And then grant his wish.
5418885 5419884 But how?
5420064 5424354 The cunning warrior attacks<br />neither body nor mind.
5424564 5425730 Tell me how!
5425897 5428063 The heart, Osborn.
5428314 5431354 First, we attack his heart.
5433230 5436837 Give us this day our daily bread,<br />and forgive us our trespasses
5437109 5439920 as we forgive those who<br />trespassed against us.
5440188 5443213 Lead us not into temptation,<br />but deliver us...
5451902 5454442 Deliver us!
5454628 5455812 Finish it!
5456147 5457176 Finish it!
5457201 5459574 From evil!
5469731 5470980 Get the BP.
5471318 5472317 Aunt May!
5472481 5473551 Is she gonna be ok?
5473575 5475414 What happened? What happened?<br />Yes, she's going to be ok.
5475438 5476484 Look, you're going to have to leave.
5476508 5477385 Right now.<br />What happened?
5477502 5478673 Those eyes!
5478753 5481213 Those horrible yellow eyes!
5487480 5488838 He knows who I am.
5533939 5534938 I'm sorry.
5539230 5540408 Will she be ok?
5540433 5541774 She's gonna be fine.
5541799 5543452 She's been sleeping all day.
5545522 5546593 Thanks for coming.
5547186 5548214 Of course.
5552439 5553438 How are you?
5553732 5555471 You ok about the other night?
5555496 5556495 Yeah, I'm fine. I...
5557212 5559161 I just felt bad<br />about leaving Aunt May.
5559439 5560551 Have you talked to Harry?
5560904 5561903 He called me.
5563043 5564396 I haven't called him back.
5567105 5568231 The fact is...
5570370 5571802 I'm in love with somebody else.
5572118 5572813 You are?
5572918 5574209 At least, I think I am.
5576856 5578869 It's not the right time to talk about it.<br />No, no.
5578894 5579893 Go on.
5580064 5582287 Would I know his name, this guy?
5583825 5585877 You'll think I'm a stupid<br />little girl with a crush.
5586564 5587586 Trust me.
5588188 5589264 It's funny.
5591439 5593301 He's saved my life twice,
5593325 5595059 and I've never even seen his face.
5596284 5597283 Him.
5597830 5598939 You're laughing at me.<br />No. No.
5598963 5600301 No, I understand.
5600811 5602246 He is extremely cool.
5602271 5605189 But do you think it's true, all the<br />terrible things they say about him?
5605214 5606176 No, no.
5606200 5609130 Not Spider-Man,<br />not a chance in the world.
5609897 5611119 I know him a little bit.
5611731 5614124 I'm sort of his<br />unofficial photographer.
5614814 5616385 Has he mentioned me?
5617170 5618169 Yeah.
5618272 5619352 What'd he say?
5620384 5621383 I said...
5622731 5624258 He asked me...
5625306 5626633 what I thought about you.
5628264 5629411 And what did you say?
5630689 5631688 I said...
5634141 5636134 Spider-Man. I said...
5637537 5639519 The great thing about MJ...
5640344 5641343 Is...
5642647 5643646 When you...
5644018 5645300 look in her eyes,
5648439 5650365 and she's looking back in yours,
5652647 5653802 everything...
5654270 5655269 feels...
5656856 5658187 Not quite normal.
5659939 5661155 Because you feel...
5662272 5663403 stronger...
5665439 5666468 and weaker...
5667196 5668507 at the same time.
5670128 5671559 You feel excited...
5673222 5674626 and at the same time...
5675772 5676881 Terrified.
5679731 5681301 The truth is you...
5681809 5683850 you don't know what you feel,
5685439 5688034 except you know what<br />kind of man you want to be.
5691772 5693200 It's as if you've...
5694272 5695271 reached...
5695627 5697040 the unreachable...
5699023 5700645 and you weren't ready for it.
5705188 5706358 You said that?
5707731 5709598 Well, something like that.
5740198 5741197 Hey.
5754314 5755313 Dad?
5761147 5762602 Dad, is that you?
5769814 5770813 What is it?
5773736 5775134 Well, you were right about MJ.
5775999 5777489 You're right about everything.
5779704 5781080 She's in love with Peter.
5782564 5783563 Parker?
5783984 5784424 Yeah.
5784694 5786325 And how does he feel about her?
5789064 5791264 He's loved her since the 4th grade.
5792564 5794218 He pretends like he doesn't, but...
5794616 5796457 there's no one Peter cares for more.
5800731 5801820 I'm so sorry.
5804939 5807122 I haven't always been<br />there for you, have I?
5810147 5812510 You're busy.<br />You're an important man. I...
5812534 5813533 I understand.
5813564 5815002 That's no excuse.
5816276 5817647 I'm proud of you.
5818689 5822195 I've lost sight of that somewhere.<br />But I'm gonna make it up to you, Harry.
5823731 5827120 I'm going to rectify certain inequities.
5841105 5842784 Wake up, little spider.
5842993 5844033 Wake up.
5845897 5847271 Go home, dear.
5847603 5848936 You look awful.
5849230 5851521 And you look beautiful.<br />Well, thank you.
5851731 5853104 I don't like to leave you here.
5853129 5854603 But I'm safe here.
5855188 5856551 Can I do anything for you?
5856575 5857896 You do too much.
5858064 5859218 College, a job,
5859433 5862267 all this time with me.<br />You're not Superman, you know.
5864355 5866077 A smile. Finally.
5866131 5869471 Haven't seen one of those on your<br />face since Mary Jane was here.
5869540 5870539 Hey.
5870590 5872599 You were supposed to be asleep.
5873754 5878100 You know, you were about 6 years old<br />when MJ's family moved in next door.
5878856 5880426 And when she got out of the car,
5880580 5882813 and you saw her for the first time,
5882981 5885593 you grabbed me and said,<br />Aunt May,
5885617 5886802 Aunt May,
5887471 5889125 is that an angel?
5889522 5890718 Gee, did I say that?
5891162 5892591 You sure did.
5895692 5896145 Well,
5896649 5897961 Harry's in love with her.
5898689 5900094 She's still his girl.
5900600 5902208 Well, isn't that up to her?
5902647 5904551 She doesn't really know who I am.
5905189 5906860 Because you won't let her.
5907439 5909865 You're so mysterious all the time.
5910814 5911813 Tell me,
5912019 5913711 would it be so dangerous
5913736 5916999 to let Mary Jane know<br />how much you care?
5918147 5920646 Everybody else knows.
5923689 5924938 I'll be right back.
5925605 5926604 But...
5934230 5935667 Come on, pick up.
5936280 5937279 Hi...<br />Hey MJ!
5937304 5938653 Sing your song at the beep.
5940731 5942173 MJ, it's Peter. You there?
5942915 5943914 Hello?
5944171 5945170 You there?
5946397 5948279 Well, I'm just calling<br />to check up on you.
5948303 5950048 Will you call me when you get in, ok?
5950946 5951945 Alright, well...
5952647 5953646 Don't...
5954637 5956173 Don't go up any dark alleys.
5957147 5958146 Hello?
5961424 5964062 Can Spider-Man come out to play?
5964981 5966182 Where is she?
6013071 6014736 What is that?<br />That's cool!
6040564 6042271 Goblin, what have you done?
6084535 6085593 Spider-Man!
6085820 6088661 This is why only fools are heroes.
6088981 6090689 Because you never know,
6090772 6094865 when some lunatic will come<br />along with a sadistic choice.
6096647 6099133 Let die the woman you love?
6103605 6104604 Or...
6105771 6108350 Suffer the little children.
6110954 6111760 Spider-Man!
6111784 6113030 Save us!
6114064 6115559 Save us!
6116564 6119146 Make your choice, Spider-Man.
6119355 6122613 And see how a hero is rewarded.
6122826 6124081 Don't do it, Goblin!
6125147 6127540 We are who we choose to be.
6128081 6129414 Now, choose!
6129439 6130492 No!
6159731 6161094 Everybody stay still!
6170814 6171981 Ahoy up there!
6172384 6175299 We're gonna bring<br />the barge right under you.
6182949 6183948 He's coming back!
6184322 6185321 Listen.
6185508 6186855 I need you to climb down.
6186880 6187718 I can't.
6187742 6188741 Yes, you can!
6193605 6195134 MJ, you can do it.
6195337 6196336 You have to!
6196696 6197695 Trust me.
6199897 6201010 Hold on tight
6201613 6202612 and go quickly.
6208064 6209063 Hurry!
6209319 6210413 I can't. I can't do it!
6210438 6211810 Hang on, Mary Jane!
6240397 6242543 He's not gonna make it.<br />He's gonna make it!
6252897 6254756 It's time to die.
6263105 6265921 Come on up here, tough guy!<br />I got a little something for ya!
6265946 6267192 We ought to kick your freaking ass!
6267216 6268426 Leave Spider-Man alone!
6268450 6270608 You gonna pick on a guy trying<br />to save a bunch of kids?
6271188 6272932 Yeah, I got something for your ass!
6272957 6274831 You mess with Spidey,<br />you mess with New York!
6274856 6277313 You mess with one of us,<br />you mess with all of us!
6290897 6292345 Spider-Man, watch out!
6324522 6326849 Misery, misery, misery.
6326874 6328480 That's what you've chosen.
6329689 6331492 I offered you friendship,
6332378 6334252 and you spat in my face.
6385397 6388519 You've spun your last web, Spider-Man.
6389230 6392872 Had you not been so selfish,<br />your little girlfriend's death
6392897 6394438 would have been quick and painless.
6394463 6397477 But now that<br />you've really pissed me off,
6398230 6399968 I'm gonna finish her,
6400420 6403287 nice and slow.
6407689 6409264 MJ and I...
6410564 6413659 We're gonna have a hell of a time.
6467518 6468807 Peter, stop!
6469314 6470313 Stop!
6470355 6471452 It's me.
6480731 6481902 Mr. Osborn.
6482253 6483674 Peter, thank God for you.
6484470 6486438 You killed those people<br />on that balcony.
6486530 6488911 The Goblin killed!<br />I had nothing to do with it!
6489285 6491392 Don't, don't let him take me again.
6491772 6493813 I beg you. Protect me.
6493981 6496120 You tried to kill Aunt May.
6496145 6497521 You tried to kill Mary Jane.
6497731 6498777 But not you.
6499897 6501426 I tried to stop it,
6501891 6503663 but I couldn't stop it.
6504064 6505551 I would never hurt you.
6506355 6507791 I knew from the beginning...
6508480 6510702 If anything ever happened to me...
6511072 6513379 It was you that I could count on.
6513897 6517229 You, Peter Parker,<br />would save me and so you have.
6517814 6519060 Thank God for you.
6520647 6521823 Give me your hand.
6523230 6524301 Believe in me...
6524684 6526305 as I believed in you.
6527766 6529606 I've been like a father to you.
6532397 6534063 Be a son to me now.
6535856 6537175 I have a father.
6538480 6540438 His name was Ben Parker.
6542856 6544854 Godspeed Spider-Man.<br />What?
6563230 6564229 Peter...
6567064 6568354 Don't tell Harry.
6600564 6601668 What have you done?
6602439 6603615 What have you done?
6627272 6628271 Hey.
6632147 6633473 I'm so sorry, Harry.
6635105 6637056 I know what it's like to lose a father.
6640397 6641593 I didn't lose him.
6641617 6643104 He was stolen from me.
6645272 6646921 One day, Spider-Man will pay.
6649439 6651845 I swear on my father's grave,<br />Spider-Man will pay.
6657564 6659111 Thank God for you, Peter.
6660105 6661625 You're the only family I have.
6686954 6688449 No matter what I do,
6689389 6691304 no matter how hard I try,
6693120 6694467 the ones I love
6695152 6697119 will always be the ones who pay.
6707772 6709661 You must miss him so much.
6711064 6713095 It's been so hard without him.
6717023 6719074 There's something<br />I've been wanting to tell you.
6721618 6722946 When I was up there,
6724300 6725819 and I thought I was gonna die...
6728647 6731087 There was only one person<br />who I was thinking of.
6733772 6736043 And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.
6738383 6739757 It was you Pete.
6741731 6742996 I kept thinking,
6744272 6746227 I hope I make it through this,
6748272 6751403 so I could see Peter Parker's<br />face one more time.
6754023 6755022 Really?
6755897 6757426 There's only one man,
6758417 6760524 who's always been there for me...
6762939 6764419 Who makes me feel...
6765355 6767813 like I'm more than I ever<br />thought I could be.
6771188 6772379 That I'm just...
6773522 6774521 Me.
6776105 6777205 And that's ok.
6779986 6780985 The truth is,
6783814 6784813 I love you.
6787689 6789286 I love you so much, Peter.
6810314 6811509 All I wanted,
6811797 6814084 was to tell<br />her how much I loved her...
6815272 6816271 I can't.
6819314 6820380 You can't what?
6821981 6823026 Tell you...
6825147 6826676 Everything. I mean...
6827724 6829396 there's so much to tell.
6830564 6831563 Yeah.
