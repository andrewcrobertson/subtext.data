188105 191274 Who am l?<br />You sure you wanna know?
191483 194735 The story of my life<br />is not for the faint of heart.
194903 197530 If somebody said<br />it was a happy little tale...
197739 202201 ...if somebody told you I was just your<br />average guy, not a care in the world...
202369 204161 ...somebody lied.
205038 208624 But let me assure you, this,<br />like any story worth telling...
208792 210209 ...is all about a girl.
211086 215548 That girl. The girl next door.<br />Mary Jane Watson.
215716 218801 The woman I've loved<br />since before I even liked girls.
218969 221637 I'd like to tell you that's me<br />next to her.
221805 223806 Aw, heck, l'd even take him.
225225 227727 Hey! Stop the bus!
228729 229896 That's me.
230105 231981 Tell him to stop! Please!
232190 233399 Stop!
233609 235818 Hey! Stop the bus!
235986 239071 Stop! He's been chasing us<br />since Woodhaven Boulevard.
239239 240489 Catch a cab, Parker!
244953 247747 Thank you. l'm sorry l'm late.
253170 254462 What a geek!
255130 259342 -Don't even think about it.<br />-You're so lame, Parker.
259509 261093 Would you date him?
278987 281197 Midtown High seniors.
281365 285076 No wandering. Proceed direct--<br />Knock it off.
285369 288829 Remember, it is a privilege<br />to be here.
289206 292458 We're guests of Columbia University's<br />Science Department.
292668 294877 So behave accordingly.
295045 298089 Let's not have a repeat<br />of our trip to the planetarium.
298298 299924 Come on, people, stay together.
300092 303010 Proceed up the steps<br />and into the building.
304179 307223 -Where were you?<br />-Checking out the library.
307391 309934 -Looking at the books.<br />-Yeah, right.
311687 314063 Charles, can we drive<br />around the corner, please?
314231 315523 Why?
315732 317525 The entrance is right there.
317693 321404 Dad, these are public-school kids.<br />I'm not showing up in the Rolls.
321571 323906 What, you want me<br />to trade in my car for a Jetta...
324074 327076 ...because you flunked out<br />of every private school I sent you to?
327244 330246 -It wasn't for me.<br />-Of course it was.
330747 332581 Don't ever be ashamed<br />of who you are.
332749 335251 I'm not ashamed of who I am.
335460 336752 It's just....
336920 338379 Just what, Harry?
338588 340089 Forget it.
343093 344427 Pete!
344845 346512 -Hi, Harry.<br />-Hey, man. What's up?
346680 348055 Harry.
348223 350433 -Won't you be needing this?<br />-Thanks, Dad.
351393 353769 Peter, may I introduce my father,<br />Norman Osborn.
353937 355354 I've heard so much about you.
355522 359025 -Great honour to meet you, sir.<br />-Harry says you're a science whiz.
359276 362111 You know,<br />I'm something of a scientist myself.
362279 365448 I read all your research<br />on nanotechnology. Really brilliant.
365615 368659 -And you understood it?<br />-Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
368869 372121 Impressive.<br />Your parents must be very proud.
372289 374123 I live with my aunt and uncle.<br />They are.
374291 376876 Hey, you two! Let's move!
377044 380713 -Nice to meet you.<br />-Hope to see you again.
383050 386552 -He doesn't seem so bad.<br />-Not if you're a genius.
386720 388679 I think he wants to adopt you.
388847 393559 There are over 32,000 known species<br />of spider in the world.
393769 397563 They're in the order Araneae,<br />divided into three suborders.
397773 398856 That's amazing!
399024 402943 This is the most advanced electron<br />microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.
403278 405321 It's unreal.
405489 408282 Arachnids from all three<br />groups possess...
408492 411744 ...varying strengths to help them<br />search for food.
412037 416415 For example, the Delena spider,<br />family Sparassidae...
416583 420753 ...has the ability to jump<br />to catch its prey.
420921 422671 For the school paper?
427177 432181 Next, we have the net web spider,<br />family Filistatidae...
432390 434266 ...genus Kukulcania.
434518 438854 Spins a funnel-shaped web whose<br />strands have a tensile strength...
439022 444318 ...proportionately equal to the<br />high-tension wires used in bridges.
444778 446445 -Leave him alone.<br />-Or what?
446613 449615 Or his father will fire your father.
450033 452368 What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?
452536 455037 What is going on?
455205 458290 The next person who talks<br />will fail this course. I kid you not.
458500 460501 -This spider...<br />-Let's go.
460669 464839 ...hunts using reflexes with<br />nerve-conduction velocity so fast...
465048 468551 ...that some researchers believe<br />it borders on precognition.
468718 470886 -An early awareness of danger.<br />-Jerks.
471054 472847 A spider-sense.
473473 475141 Hey, look at that spider.
475308 479728 Some spiders change colours<br />to blend into their environment.
479980 481897 It's a defence mechanism.
482065 485359 Peter, what makes you think<br />I would want to know that?
485527 486735 Who wouldn't?
486903 490739 Over five painstaking years,<br />Columbia's genetic research facility....
490907 495286 -You gonna talk to her now?<br />-Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.
495495 497413 Armed with these DNA blueprints...
497581 500249 ...we have now begun<br />what was once thought impossible.
500458 504128 -Disgusting.<br />-Yeah, hateful little things.
504337 505713 I love them!
506256 507923 Yeah, me too.
508884 512761 You know, spiders can change<br />their colour...
512929 516765 -...to blend into their environment.<br />-Really?
516933 521145 -Yeah, it's a defence mechanism.<br />-Cool.
521313 524648 --transfer RNA<br />to encode an entirely new genome...
524816 527943 ...combining the genetic<br />information from all three spiders...
528111 532781 ...into these 15 genetically<br />designed super-spiders.
532949 534450 There's 14.
534910 536285 I beg your pardon?
536453 538996 -One's missing.<br />-Yeah.
541917 544543 I guess the researchers<br />are working on that one.
545045 548380 Do you know that this is the largest<br />electron microscope...
548548 549798 ...on the Eastern Seaboard?
549966 554011 You were talking throughout<br />that woman's entire presentation.
554179 555930 Let's go talk about how we listen.
560018 564104 Now, I don't know what it's like<br />at those fancy private schools...
564314 566190 ...but at Midtown High....
574658 578410 Could I take your picture?<br />I need one with a student in it.
578578 580162 -Sure.<br />-Great.
580330 582539 Where do you want me?<br />Over here?
582749 584083 Yeah, that's great.
584501 586168 Don't make me look ugly.
586544 588379 That's impossible.
595637 596887 Perfect.
604646 606188 -Is that good?<br />-Great.
611736 613112 That's great.
618702 620703 M.J., let's go!
622247 624832 Wait. Thanks!
638305 641056 Parker, let's do it.
657782 661243 We solved the horizon glide<br />and the multi-G balance issues.
661411 663954 I've already seen the glider.
664372 666415 That's not what I'm here for.
666624 669293 General Slocum,<br />good to see you again.
670128 672296 Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.
672547 674381 -Norman.<br />-Mr. Osborn.
674549 678093 Always a pleasure to have<br />our board of directors visit.
678303 681722 I want to see the progress report<br />on human performance enhancers.
681890 686393 We tried vapour inhalation with rats.<br />Their strength increased by 800%.
686561 688437 -Excellent.<br />-Any side effects?
688605 689688 In one trial, yes.
689856 692524 An aberration. All the tests since<br />have been successful.
692692 696445 In the trial that went wrong,<br />what were the side effects?
696613 698947 Violence, aggression...
699616 700866 ...and insanity.
701034 703786 -What do you recommend?<br />-That was only one test.
704037 707873 Except for Dr. Stromm,<br />our entire staff certifies the product...
708041 710959 -...ready for human testing.<br />-Dr. Stromm?
712295 715964 We need to take the whole line<br />back to formula.
717217 719635 -Back to formula?<br />-Dr. Osborn.
720804 722638 I'll be frank with you.
722889 727726 I never supported your programme. We<br />have my predecessor to thank for that.
727894 730646 The general has approved<br />Quest Aerospace...
730814 733732 ...to build a prototype<br />of their exoskeleton design.
734067 737653 -They test in two weeks.<br />-And if your performance enhancers...
737821 742241 ...have not had a successful<br />human trial by that date...
742492 746870 ...I'm gonna pull your funding.<br />I'm going to give it to them.
748665 750332 Gentlemen. Ladies.
755422 760843 And the Lord said, "Let there be light."<br />And voil√†! There is light.
761094 763178 Forty soft, glowing watts of it.
763346 768183 Good boy. God will be thrilled.<br />Just don't fall on your ass.
768518 770936 I'm already on my ass, May.
771104 775607 When the plant's senior electrician<br />is laid off after 35 years...
775775 778485 ...what else would you call it?<br />I am on my ass.
778695 781029 Hand me that dish. The green one.
781281 784032 The corporation is downsizing<br />the people...
784492 786368 ...and upsizing their profits.
786619 789538 Oh, Ben, you'll get another job<br />somewhere.
790582 793459 Well.... Well, let's look<br />in the paper and see.
794586 797379 There are the want ads.<br />What do we got here?
797547 799173 Computer....
799382 803135 Computer salesman, computer<br />engineer, computer analyst.
803303 807055 My Lord, even the computers<br />need analysts these days.
807348 812644 I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and<br />besides, I have a family to provide for.
812854 815731 I love you. And Peter loves you.
815982 819234 You're the most responsible man<br />I've ever known.
819486 823906 We've been down-and-out before.<br />But somehow, we survive.
825033 829328 Hi, sweetie. You're just--<br />Just in time for dinner.
829537 832080 Hey. How you doing, buddy?<br />How was the field trip?
832248 835083 I don't feel well.<br />I'm gonna go to sleep.
835251 837753 -You won't have a bite?<br />-No thanks. Had a bite.
837921 840339 Did you get some pictures, Peter?
841174 844009 I gotta crash. Everything's fine.
845428 847012 What's that all about?
868284 870494 In this recombination lab...
870662 875290 ...we use synthesized transfer RNA<br />to encode an entirely new genome...
875500 878544 ...combining the genetic<br />information from all three spiders...
878753 883549 ...into these 15 genetically<br />designed super-spiders.
898022 901984 Dr. Osborn, please. The<br />performance enhancers aren't ready.
902151 905487 The data just doesn't justify<br />this test.
905655 909324 Now, l'm asking you for the last time.<br />We can't do this.
909492 911702 Don't be a coward.
912161 914746 Risks are part of laboratory science.
914956 918667 Let me reschedule, with a proper<br />medical staff and a volunteer.
918876 922337 -Just give me two weeks.<br />-Two weeks? ln two weeks...
922505 926008 ...we'll have lost the contract<br />to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.
926175 928927 Sometimes you gotta<br />do things yourself.
929095 931763 -Get me the Promachloraperazine.<br />-For what?
931931 935684 It begins catalyzation when the vapour<br />hits the bloodstream.
938605 940272 40,000 years of evolution...
940440 944192 ...and we've barely tapped<br />the vastness of human potential.
958041 959374 Oh, that's cold.
1018101 1019101 Norman?
1023606 1027442 Norman!
1035618 1036952 Oh, my God.
1038454 1041581 Oh, my God! Norman?
1042250 1044376 Oh, my God! Norman!
1060518 1061977 Back to formula?
1097013 1098513 Weird.
1109442 1110817 -Peter?<br />-Yeah?
1111027 1112778 Are you all right?
1114697 1116323 I'm fine.
1116866 1118742 Any better this morning?<br />Any change?
1118910 1120285 Change?
1121287 1123205 Yep. Big change.
1123372 1127375 -Well, hurry up. You'll be late.<br />-Right.
1145770 1147145 Okay.
1151192 1155654 -Goodness me!<br />-Jeez. I thought you were sick.
1156197 1157531 -I got better.<br />-You see?
1157698 1161076 -Bye, guys.<br />-Have you got your lunch money?
1161244 1164913 Hey, Michelangelo, don't forget,<br />we're painting the kitchen after school.
1165081 1167874 Sure thing, Uncle Ben.<br />Don't start without me.
1168084 1170168 And don't start up with me.
1171462 1175423 Teenagers. Raging hormones.<br />They never change.
1176384 1180095 You're trash!<br />You're always gonna be trash!
1180263 1183849 -I have to go to school.<br />-Who's stopping you?
1201242 1202909 Hi, M.J.
1203786 1205287 Hey, M.J.
1205538 1210083 I don't know if you realise this, but<br />we've been neighbours since I was 6.
1210251 1213587 And I was wondering<br />if we could get together sometime?
1213796 1215338 I got the car. Hop in.
1215506 1218133 Do something fun?<br />Or, I don't know.
1218301 1221052 I thought it'd be time<br />to get to know each other.
1222430 1223680 Or not.
1229145 1231855 Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!
1233232 1235942 -Stop the bus!<br />-Catch a cab!
1236360 1237986 Tell him to stop.
1238654 1240655 -Check him out!<br />-Dork!
1263137 1264387 Dad!
1264847 1266723 Dad, are you all right?
1267558 1268850 Harry.
1272188 1274189 What are you doing on the floor?
1274357 1275690 I don't know.
1276525 1278860 Have you been there all night?
1280863 1282113 Last night I was--
1284450 1285700 What?
1286953 1288703 -I don't remember.<br />-Mr. Osborn?
1288871 1291247 Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.
1291415 1295794 -My father's not feeling well.<br />-Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.
1295962 1296962 What?
1297129 1300715 They found his body in the lab.<br />He's been murdered, sir.
1300883 1304177 -What are you talking about?<br />-And the flight suit and the glider....
1304345 1306429 -What about it?<br />-It's been stolen, sir.
1331372 1334124 Wow! Great reflexes!
1335001 1337168 -Thanks.<br />-No problem.
1338254 1342173 Hey, you have blue eyes.<br />I didn't notice without your glasses.
1342925 1344592 You just get contacts?
1351350 1353518 Well, see you.
1395311 1398813 -What happened?<br />-He's freaking weird.
1399273 1400648 Did you see that?
1402234 1403902 Parker?
1435810 1438103 -It's a fight!<br />-Think you're pretty funny, freak?
1438270 1441314 -Flash, it was an accident.<br />-So is my breaking your teeth.
1441482 1444192 -Come on, Flash, stop.<br />-I don't wanna fight you, Flash.
1444360 1446820 -I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.<br />-Kick his ass.
1467049 1468091 Help him, Harry.
1473055 1474556 How'd he do that?
1475558 1476891 Which one?
1477059 1478434 He's all yours, man.
1493951 1495660 Flash, get up!
1497288 1500415 Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.
1501000 1503835 Peter, that was-- That was amazing.
1504753 1506754 I'm out of here. Come on.
1611944 1612986 Go, web!
1614571 1616197 Fly.
1617783 1619867 Up, up and away, web.
1621370 1622870 Shazam!
1623372 1624706 Go! Go!
1624873 1626708 Go, web, go!
1659825 1661576 Tallyho.
1705496 1708122 -Is she back with the beer yet?<br />-What?
1708290 1709540 Bring me some beer.
1709750 1712293 -Get up off your ass.<br />-I paid for beer--
1712461 1713961 -Stop yelling.<br />-Stop it!
1714129 1716464 You're as stupid as your mother.<br />Get away from me!
1716632 1718216 You are drunk, do you know that?
1718384 1720927 Where's she going?<br />Where you going?
1722012 1725348 These dishes are not done.<br />Somebody's gotta do the dishes.
1725557 1728851 -Why don't you do them?<br />-Get in here and do the dishes.
1729061 1733189 -You do them. They're yours, anyway.<br />-I'm going out!
1733399 1735900 -Were you listening to that?<br />-No.
1736235 1739487 Well, I heard, but I was<br />just taking out the trash.
1739655 1742407 I guess you can always hear us.
1742574 1744867 Everybody shouts.
1745077 1746327 Your aunt and uncle don't.
1747162 1750289 Oh, they can scream<br />pretty good sometimes.
1751667 1755878 Listen, M.J., about today<br />at school with Flash--
1756130 1757755 You really freaked us out.
1757965 1760216 I'm sorry. ls he okay?
1760509 1764470 He's just happy you didn't give him<br />a black eye for graduation.
1767558 1770768 So where are you going<br />after you graduate?
1775524 1777817 I wanna move into the city.
1778735 1783531 And hopefully get a job<br />as a photographer.
1783699 1786534 Work my way through college.
1787536 1788870 What about you?
1789037 1791038 Headed for the city too.
1791748 1794000 Can't wait to get out of here.
1795169 1796669 I wanna....
1797921 1799422 What?
1802259 1804427 No, come on. Try me.
1805429 1806929 I wanna...
1808056 1809390 ...act...
1810559 1812059 ...on-stage.
1812561 1814395 Really?
1814771 1816939 Oh, that's perfect.
1817232 1819775 You were awesome<br />in all the school plays.
1820110 1821944 -Really?<br />-Yeah.
1822613 1825615 I cried like a baby<br />when you played Cinderella.
1826074 1828284 Peter, that was first grade.
1828785 1830286 Well...
1830829 1832330 ...even so.
1833332 1835249 Sometimes...
1836084 1837752 ...you know people.
1838921 1842507 You can just see what's coming.
1845594 1848346 What do you see coming for you?
1850933 1852600 I don't know.
1854937 1859607 Whatever it is, it's something<br />I never felt before.
1863195 1866113 And what for me?
1866281 1867615 For you?
1869034 1871786 You're gonna light up Broadway.
1873288 1874622 You know...
1879002 1881629 ...you're taller than you look.
1881797 1883339 I hunch.
1885592 1887093 Don't.
1890639 1894308 Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride<br />in my new birthday present.
1895269 1896561 Come on.
1897312 1898980 I gotta go.
1899773 1900982 Bye.
1901650 1904318 -Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!<br />-Yeah, right?
1904486 1906487 -Look at it!<br />-Hop in.
1906655 1908906 Oh, my God! What a cool car!
1909157 1910741 Pretty tight, huh?
1911159 1915496 Wait till you hear the sound system.<br />Hey, don't scratch the leather.
1916999 1918499 Cool car.
2011218 2013260 What's going on in there?
2013470 2016097 I'm exercising.<br />I'm not dressed, Aunt May.
2016264 2019934 Well, you're acting<br />so strangely, Peter.
2020227 2022311 Okay. Thanks.
2053135 2056470 Something's bothering him. Maybe<br />he's too embarrassed to tell me.
2056638 2059306 Maybe I'm too embarrassed<br />to ask him.
2060100 2062143 I just don't know anymore.
2062561 2064895 I'm going to the library.<br />I'll see you later.
2065063 2068691 -Wait, Pete. I'll drive you there, buddy.<br />-I'll take the train.
2068859 2072111 No, I need the exercise.<br />Go on. Go, go.
2083165 2086625 -Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.<br />-Wait a minute, we need to talk.
2086793 2091172 -We can talk later.<br />-Well, we can talk now. If you let me.
2092048 2094258 What do we have to talk about?<br />Why now?
2094426 2096302 Because we haven't talked<br />for so long...
2096470 2098471 ...May and I<br />don't know who you are anymore.
2098638 2103684 You shirk your chores. You have all<br />those weird experiments in your room.
2103852 2107980 -You start fights at school--<br />-I didn't start that fight, I told you that.
2108190 2111150 -You sure as hell finished it.<br />-Was I supposed to run away?
2111359 2114361 No, you're not supposed<br />to run away, but....
2114529 2119074 Pete, you're changing. I went through<br />exactly the same thing at your age.
2119284 2120826 No. Not exactly.
2120994 2122119 Peter...
2122662 2125372 ...these are the years<br />when a man changes...
2125540 2129543 ...into the man he's gonna become<br />the rest of his life.
2129711 2132004 Just be careful<br />who you change into.
2134341 2138844 This guy, Flash Thompson,<br />he probably deserved what happened.
2139387 2142097 But just because you can<br />beat him up...
2142557 2144809 ...doesn't give you the right to.
2145477 2150731 Remember, with great power<br />comes great responsibility.
2151316 2156320 Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?<br />Quit worrying about me, okay?
2156488 2159907 Something's different.<br />I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing me.
2160200 2164411 I don't mean to lecture or preach.<br />And I know l'm not your father--
2164579 2167414 Then stop pretending to be!
2171503 2172753 Right.
2175715 2177675 I'll pick you up here at 10.
2209040 2214753 Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
2219467 2223512 -One, two, three. That's it!<br />-Who's the man?
2227642 2229852 Ladies and gentlemen...
2230020 2234565 ...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.
2237652 2241322 For $3000...
2241489 2245117 ...is there no one here man enough<br />to stay in the ring...
2245285 2249997 ...for three minutes<br />with this titan of testosterone?
2252584 2254668 Who?
2254920 2256795 I know who.
2257005 2261800 The Flying Dutchman!
2262135 2263594 Next.
2264429 2267723 There's no featherweight<br />division here, small fry. Next.
2267891 2269725 No, no. Sign me up.
2270143 2273562 Okay. You understand the NYWL<br />is not responsible...
2273772 2277858 ...for any injury you may and probably<br />will sustain in said event?
2278026 2280277 And you're participating<br />under your own free will?
2280445 2281528 Yes.
2281696 2285491 Down the hall to the ramp.<br />May God be with you. Next.
2288078 2290329 Told you! Told you!
2290538 2292331 Winner!
2292540 2293749 Next victim!
2295627 2298504 Are you ready for more?
2299631 2303217 Bone Saw is ready!
2305637 2310307 Will the next victim please<br />enter the arena at this time?
2310517 2315229 If he can withstand just three minutes<br />in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...
2315480 2319858 ...the sum of $3000 will be paid to--
2320735 2323737 -What's your name, kid?<br />-The Human Spider.
2324322 2326699 That's it? That's the best you got?
2326866 2328993 -Yeah.<br />-Oh, that sucks.
2329160 2333664 The sum of $3000 will be paid to...
2333832 2337084 ...the terrifying, the deadly...
2337335 2340546 ...the amazing Spider-Man!
2342924 2345551 -It's "The Human Spider."<br />-I don't care, get out there.
2345719 2348762 -No, he got my name wrong.<br />-Get out there, you moron.
2351224 2353809 Bone Saw will eat you up<br />and spit you out.
2354060 2356061 I hope you brought your mommy.
2356271 2359773 -We'll break you!<br />-You'll need someone to cry to.
2361067 2366196 I'm gonna rip all eight of your<br />feeble legs off one by one.
2366698 2368741 Oh, my God!
2368950 2370576 Oh, my legs!
2370744 2373370 Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.
2373538 2385299 Kill! Kill! Kill!
2385467 2386675 Cage!
2396019 2397478 Hello? Guys?
2398521 2403484 Will the guards please lock<br />the cage doors at this time?
2404194 2408489 This is some kind of mistake.<br />I didn't sign up for a cage match!
2409657 2412159 Unlock the thing!<br />Take the chain off!
2412368 2414161 Hey, freak show!
2414370 2416997 You're going nowhere.
2417165 2419541 I got you for three minutes.
2419709 2422002 Three minutes of playtime.
2428635 2431428 -What are you doing up there?<br />-Staying away from you.
2432305 2434890 That's a cute outfit.<br />Did your husband give it to you?
2442023 2443565 Finish him off!
2450740 2452282 Smash him!
2459457 2461208 -Hit him!<br />-Harder!
2463211 2465546 Kick his spider ass!
2467549 2468715 Hit him!
2482147 2483939 One, two, three!
2484149 2486942 That's it! That's it!<br />Winner!
2487110 2492197 Ladies and gentlemen, give it up<br />for the new champion, Spider-Man!
2493074 2496743 Spider-Man! Spider-Man!<br />Spider-Man!
2509591 2511258 Now get out of here.
2512886 2515721 A hundred bucks?<br />The ad said 3000.
2515930 2518307 Well, check it again, webhead.
2518474 2522352 It said three grand for three minutes.<br />You pinned him in two.
2522562 2525939 For that, I give you 100.<br />You're lucky to get that.
2526107 2527482 I need that money.
2527942 2531028 I missed the part<br />where that's my problem.
2539120 2542456 -Hey, what the hell--?<br />-Put the money in the bag.
2544292 2545626 Hurry up!
2551966 2554051 Hey! He stole the gate!
2554219 2556178 Stop that guy!
2556471 2559014 Stop him! He's got my money!
2559224 2560474 Thanks.
2561643 2564144 What's the hell's the matter with you?<br />You let him go!
2564312 2566521 Cut him off in the lobby<br />and call the cops!
2566689 2570734 You could've taken that guy apart.<br />Now he'll get away with my money.
2570902 2573153 I missed the part<br />where that's my problem.
2592674 2595592 -Sir, you gotta get back.<br />-I can't see. What happened?
2596844 2598220 Old dude, man.
2598429 2602599 Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.<br />Keep moving. Let's go!
2602767 2605602 -What happened?<br />-Someone got hurt.
2607981 2611191 -Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.<br />-Stay back.
2611693 2613527 -Stay back!<br />-That's my uncle!
2615697 2618407 -What happened?<br />-Carjacker. He's been shot.
2618574 2621994 We just called the paramedics.<br />They're on their way.
2622203 2623578 Uncle Ben?
2624497 2625998 Uncle Ben.
2629752 2631086 Uncle Ben?
2634716 2636216 Peter.
2637093 2638885 I'm here, Uncle Ben.
2644517 2645726 Peter.
2667707 2670751 They got the shooter.<br />He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.
2670960 2675672 We got three cars in pursuit.<br />All right, folks. Come on, move back.
2832788 2834789 Get a unit to the rear!
2837752 2839294 I got the back!
2852225 2853600 Who's there?
2879835 2882963 Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.<br />Give me a chance!
2883130 2887634 What about my uncle?<br />Did you give him a chance? Did you?
2887802 2889302 Answer me!
2892640 2893974 Stop that guy!
2899438 2901147 Thanks.
2911075 2912158 See you.
2933848 2937309 Freeze! We've got the place<br />completely surrounded.
2979810 2982395 Oh, no. My God.
2984357 2988068 Oh, no.<br />Oh, my God. No!
2996410 2999371 -Good evening.<br />-General. Good to see you.
3000164 3003041 Our exoskeleton's got<br />real firepower, general.
3003209 3008380 Well, if it does what you say it can,<br />I'll sign that contract tomorrow.
3009590 3012884 -He's clear, let's go!<br />-You're confident about this test?
3013094 3015345 Absolutely.<br />Captain Curtis is our top pilot.
3016097 3018848 Now, what about your commitment<br />to OSCORP?
3019016 3022936 Nothing would please me more than to<br />put Norman Osborn out of business.
3025272 3028316 Preflight complete. Mark.
3032446 3035073 We are picking up<br />an unidentified object, closing fast.
3035241 3036324 What the hell is that?
3036492 3037992 Can you see anything?
3038452 3039828 Oh, my God!
3050089 3052966 -Say "chess."<br />-Chess!
3053467 3055343 Peter!
3055553 3059472 Darling, I'm so proud of you.<br />You looked so handsome up there.
3059640 3063727 Pete? Good news. Dad got the place<br />in New York, so we're all set this fall.
3063894 3065478 -That's great.<br />-You made it.
3068065 3071568 It's not the first time<br />I've been proven wrong.
3072987 3075155 -Congratulations.<br />-Thanks, Dad.
3075656 3078199 Peter, the science award.<br />That's terrific.
3078576 3079868 Yeah.
3082830 3086207 I know this has been<br />a difficult time for you...
3086375 3089627 ...but I want you to try<br />to enjoy this day.
3089837 3091379 Commencement:
3091547 3095675 The end of one thing,<br />the start of something new.
3097511 3101181 I don't want to be with you anymore.<br />Here's your ring.
3102057 3103933 You know what? Whatever.
3104477 3105935 Your loss.
3106645 3110190 You're like a brother to Harry.<br />That makes you family.
3110357 3113318 And if you ever need anything,<br />just give me a call.
3128083 3130335 Can I fix you something?
3130503 3132003 No, thanks.
3176757 3178967 I missed him a lot today.
3181554 3183054 I know.
3184807 3186641 I miss him too.
3188394 3190728 But he was there.
3193899 3199112 I can't help thinking about<br />the last thing I said to him.
3199405 3204325 He tried to tell me something<br />important, and I threw it in his face.
3206078 3208162 You loved him...
3209832 3212083 ...and he loved you.
3212960 3216629 He never doubted<br />the man you'd grow into.
3216797 3220258 How you were meant<br />for great things.
3220801 3223136 You won't disappoint him.
3256670 3260840 With great power<br />comes great responsibility.
3261008 3264218 Remember that, Pete.<br />Remember that.
3274229 3275521 Hurry up!
3287868 3291621 He's not a man. My brother saw him<br />building a nest in Lincoln Center.
3291789 3294999 I think he's human, a man.<br />Could be a woman.
3299088 3301839 Bobby. Get a load of this!
3305177 3307053 He throws up his hands,<br />ropes come out...
3307221 3309263 ...and he climbs up them<br />like a spider web.
3309556 3313685 I see the web, his signature,<br />and I know Spider-Man was here.
3313852 3316479 The guy protects us,<br />protects the people.
3316647 3319399 Some kind of freakyloo<br />or something. Wackadoo.
3319566 3321567 He stinks and I don't like him.
3322319 3323903 Don't move, lady!
3331996 3334747 Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.
3334957 3337083 He has those tights<br />and that tight little--
3337251 3340586 Dresses like a spider<br />He looks like a bug
3340796 3344549 But we should all just give him<br />One big hug
3344758 3349345 Look out<br />Here comes the Spider-Man
3353017 3356769 "Who is Spider-Man?"<br />He's a criminal, that's who he is.
3356937 3360815 A vigilante, a public menace.<br />Why's he on my front page?
3361025 3362942 Mr. Jameson, your wife needs--
3363110 3364527 There's a page six problem.
3364695 3366612 We have a page one problem.<br />Shut up.
3366780 3368322 -Well?<br />-He's news.
3368532 3370950 -The clients can't wait.<br />-They're about to.
3371118 3375204 -He pulled six people off a subway.<br />-From a wreck he probably caused.
3375372 3377040 Something goes wrong<br />and he's there.
3377207 3379542 Look! He's fleeing the scene.<br />What's that tell you?
3379710 3382462 He's not fleeing, he's probably<br />going to save somebody else.
3382629 3383629 He's a hero!
3383797 3386632 Then why does he wear a mask?<br />What's he got to hide?
3386800 3389761 She needs to know if you want<br />chintz or chenille in the dining room.
3389928 3392472 -Whichever one's cheaper.<br />-Mr. Jameson, it's like this:
3392639 3393973 We double-booked page six.
3394141 3396476 So Macy's and Conway's both have<br />three quarters--
3396643 3399812 -We sold out four printings.<br />-Sold out?
3399980 3401230 Every copy.
3401815 3404317 Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one,<br />with a decent picture.
3404485 3406152 -Conway to page 7.<br />-That's a problem.
3406320 3408654 Page eight, give him 10 percent off.<br />Five percent.
3408822 3410531 -That can't be done.<br />-Get out of here!
3410699 3412617 We don't have a decent picture.
3412785 3415536 Eddie's been on it for weeks,<br />but we can barely see him.
3415704 3417830 Aw, what is he, shy?
3417998 3422001 If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts<br />in a thong, we can get this weirdo.
3422169 3425588 Put an ad on the front page:<br />"Cash for a picture of Spider-Man."
3425756 3429217 He doesn't wanna be famous?<br />I'll make him infamous!
3440437 3441521 Hey!
3441688 3443106 Buzz off.
3443816 3446776 -M.J., it's me, Peter.<br />-Hi!
3448487 3453366 -What are you doing around here?<br />-Begging for a job. How about you?
3453867 3457578 -I'm headed to an audition.<br />-An audition? So you're acting?
3457746 3458788 Yeah.
3458997 3462875 I work steady.<br />In fact, I just got off a job.
3463043 3464210 That's great.
3464795 3468005 -You're doing it. Living your dream.<br />-Glamour girl!
3468173 3469799 Your drawer was short $6!
3469967 3472593 Next time that happens,<br />I'll take it out of your cheque.
3473679 3477473 Excuse me, Miss Watson?<br />I'm talking to you! Hey!
3477683 3479976 Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.
3480144 3484272 It better not happen no more.<br />Don't roll your eyes at me.
3491238 3492947 Some dream, huh?
3493824 3496450 It's nothing to be<br />embarrassed about.
3496618 3499412 -Don't tell Harry.<br />-Don't tell Harry?
3499830 3504417 Don't you guys live together?<br />We're going out. Didn't he tell you?
3504835 3506419 Oh, yeah. Right.
3506670 3509755 I think he'd hate the idea<br />of my waiting tables.
3509923 3514343 -He'd think it was low or something.<br />-It's not low. You have a job.
3514678 3519015 You know, Harry doesn't live on<br />a little place I like to call Earth.
3520517 3522435 No, I guess not.
3527441 3529025 Thanks, Pete.
3530444 3532361 We should catch up sometime.
3536575 3539118 Let's get some lunch some evening.
3540370 3544874 I'll come by and have some of your<br />Moondance coffee some day.
3545083 3547793 -And I won't tell Harry.<br />-No, don't tell Harry.
3547961 3549212 I won't.
3551381 3553132 I won't tell Harry.
3564436 3566896 Timing's perfect. Hey.
3567105 3570399 Five new contracts. It'll be great.
3572527 3575196 Storming Norman's<br />making his weekly inspection.
3576031 3578282 Spent half of it on the phone.
3578867 3583579 Look, man, l'm glad you're here.<br />I need your help. I'm really lost here.
3584414 3585706 Are you all right?
3587042 3591587 You look like you just got<br />second place in the science fair.
3592881 3595800 I was late for work<br />and Dr. Connors fired me.
3595968 3597551 You were late again?
3598178 3600930 I don't get it.<br />Where do you go all the time?
3602307 3603557 Around.
3603725 3605434 Peter Parker.
3605769 3608271 -Maybe you'll tell me who she is.<br />-Who's that?
3608438 3611524 -This mystery girl Harry's been dating.<br />-Dad.
3611900 3613567 -When do I get to meet her?<br />-Dad.
3613735 3617029 Well, sorry.<br />Harry hasn't mentioned her.
3619908 3623160 Pete, you're probably looking<br />for a job now, right?
3623370 3626205 Dad, maybe you can help him out.
3626373 3630710 -No, I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.<br />-It's no problem. I'll make a few calls.
3630877 3635172 No, I couldn't accept it, sir.<br />I like to earn what I get. I'll find work.
3635340 3637008 I respect that.
3637718 3639844 You want to make it<br />on your own steam.
3640512 3641846 That's great.
3642723 3645057 What other skills do you have,<br />Parker?
3645267 3647226 I was thinking about photography.
3650355 3651605 Hello.
3653525 3655818 Let's go! Move it!
3656987 3658654 Watch the street!
3674087 3675463 Cheese!
3684389 3685681 They're crap.
3685891 3688851 Crap, crap. Megacrap.
3689061 3692229 -I'll give you $200 for all of them.<br />-That seems a little low.
3692439 3694190 Take them somewhere else, then.
3694358 3696901 Your wife says the tile for the foyer<br />is out of stock.
3697069 3698694 Tell her we'll put a rug there.
3699071 3701030 Sit down. Give me that.
3702616 3705159 Give you 300.<br />That's the standard freelance fee.
3705327 3707661 -Tear up page one. Run that photo.<br />-Headline?
3707954 3711248 "Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?<br />Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos."
3711416 3713250 Menace? He was protecting<br />that armoured--
3713418 3714460 Tell you what, Atticus.
3714628 3717338 You take the pictures,<br />I'll make up the headlines. Okay?
3717506 3719507 -Yes, sir.<br />-Goody.
3719966 3723469 Give this to the girl up front.<br />She'll see you get paid.
3723970 3726722 -I'd like a job, sir.<br />-No jobs. Freelance.
3726932 3728557 Best thing for a kid your age.
3728767 3733062 You bring me more shots<br />of that clown, maybe I'll buy them.
3733271 3736232 But I never said you have a job.<br />Meat.
3736400 3740694 I'll send you a box of Christmas<br />meat. Bring me more photos.
3742280 3743489 -Hi.<br />-Hi.
3743698 3747118 Mr. Jameson told me<br />to give that to you.
3748203 3751330 -Welcome to the Daily Bugle.<br />-Thank you.
3751873 3753249 I'm Peter Parker.
3755752 3757920 I'm a photographer.
3758713 3761257 Yes. I can see that.
3768974 3770808 As of today...
3770976 3774979 ...OSCORP lndustries has surpassed<br />Quest Aerospace...
3775230 3779650 ...as the principal supplier<br />to the United States military.
3779818 3782653 In short, ladies and gentlemen<br />of the board...
3782821 3785990 ...costs are down,<br />revenues are up...
3786241 3789076 ...and our stock<br />has never been higher.
3789244 3793664 Wonderful news, Norman.<br />That's why we're selling the company.
3794749 3795749 What?
3795959 3801130 Quest is recapitalizing in the wake<br />of the bombing. Expanding.
3801339 3804091 They made a tender offer<br />we can't ignore.
3804259 3805426 Why wasn't I told?
3805594 3809680 They don't want a power struggle<br />with entrenched management.
3809973 3812266 The deal is off if you come with it.
3812434 3815853 The board expects your resignation<br />in 30 days.
3816062 3818022 You can't do this to me.
3821193 3823486 I started this company.
3824529 3826947 You know how much I sacrificed?!
3830785 3836248 -Oh, Max. Please.<br />-Norman, the board is unanimous.
3836791 3840794 We're announcing the sale<br />after the World Unity Festival.
3840962 3842463 I'm sorry.
3843465 3845591 You're out, Norman.
3855477 3856977 Am l?
3861066 3864109 Welcome to OSCORP lndustries<br />Unity Day Festival.
3864277 3867696 Let's hear it for Macy Gray.
3904150 3907653 M.J., why didn't you wear<br />the black dress?
3908697 3912366 Just, I wanted to impress my father.<br />He loves black.
3912534 3917037 Well, maybe he'll be impressed<br />no matter what. You think l'm pretty.
3917622 3919999 I think you're beautiful.
3932804 3936056 M.J., would you do me a favour?<br />I forgot my drink inside.
3946276 3948402 -Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.<br />-Oh, Harry.
3949487 3954658 -Have you seen my father around?<br />-Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.
3966671 3969173 -What is that?<br />-Must be new this year.
3974054 3975304 What is that?
3975472 3976555 That's our glider!
3987817 3989276 What the hell was that?
4017681 4019098 Code three!
4035115 4037282 -Oh, my God! Harry!<br />-M.J.!
4043248 4046709 Harry! Help me! Harry!
4052674 4054425 Out, am l?
4058972 4061056 -Mary Jane!<br />-Harry!
4064185 4066061 Hello, my dear.
4067063 4068897 It's Spider-Man!
4080410 4082369 -Come on, move, kid.<br />-Billy!
4085874 4088208 Somebody help him!
4088418 4089668 No!
4091463 4093005 Mommy!
4095008 4096967 -Hold it!<br />-I surrender.
4097552 4100053 -Oh, boy.<br />-Hold it right there!
4105852 4107102 Impressive.
4131377 4134838 -Mary Jane!<br />-Help! Someone please help me!
4160198 4161240 Hold on!
4162909 4163909 Watch out!
4173044 4176839 We'll meet again, Spider-Man!
4178424 4180342 Hold on, Mary Jane!
4222343 4225012 Well, beats taking the subway.
4225221 4228432 Don't mind us.<br />She just needs to use the elevator.
4228641 4229766 Wait.
4229934 4231184 Who are you?
4231352 4233937 -You know who I am.<br />-I do?
4234147 4236148 Your friendly neighbourhood<br />Spider-Man.
4248494 4252372 Incredible?<br />What do you mean he's incredible?
4253541 4257210 No. All right, wait.<br />Stay there. I'm gonna come over.
4257879 4259546 No, I'm gonna come--
4259881 4263300 All right. Fine.<br />Will you call me in the morning?
4263509 4266470 And we'll go and have breakfast<br />and...
4266638 4268931 ...I wanna buy you something.
4269098 4272434 Because I want to.<br />It'll make you feel better.
4273478 4277147 Okay. And what do you mean,<br />incredible?
4279984 4282361 All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.
4282528 4284279 Don't let the bedbugs--
4290036 4292996 She's all right.<br />She's just a little rattled.
4294707 4298335 Look, Pete, I should have<br />told you about us.
4299712 4302339 But you should know<br />I'm crazy about her.
4302507 4305550 It's just, you know,<br />you never made a move.
4306636 4308136 You're right.
4309055 4310555 I didn't.
4314560 4316979 I'm gonna get some rest.
4318231 4320482 I'm gonna stay up for a while.
4321567 4323318 What was that thing?
4323903 4325320 I don't know.
4326656 4330033 Whatever it is,<br />somebody has to stop it.
4345925 4347592 Somebody there?
4347844 4349886 Somebody.
4351222 4352764 Who said that?
4353433 4356768 Don't play the innocent with me.
4359230 4361898 You've known all along.
4365903 4367279 Where are you?
4367447 4371575 Follow the cold shiver<br />running down your spine.
4378374 4380208 I'm right here.
4381961 4383962 I don't understand.
4384964 4388133 Did you think it was coincidence?
4388384 4391928 So many good things,<br />all happening for you.
4392096 4395766 All for you. Norman.
4398311 4399728 What do you want?
4400271 4402314 To say what you won't.
4402607 4405150 To do what you can't.
4405318 4409905 To remove those in your way.
4413868 4415827 The board members.
4417121 4418497 You killed them.
4418664 4420290 We killed them.
4420625 4421625 We?
4421793 4423335 Remember?
4423503 4426171 Your little accident<br />in the laboratory.
4428174 4429800 The performance enhancers.
4429967 4435013 Bingo. Me!<br />Your greatest creation.
4435515 4439309 Bringing you<br />what you've always wanted:
4439477 4442354 Power beyond your wildest dreams.
4442522 4445023 And it's only the beginning.
4446526 4450862 There's only one who can stop us.
4451656 4455158 Or imagine if he joined us.
4459956 4463041 Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.
4463209 4466545 The Green Goblin. You like that?<br />Made it up myself.
4466712 4468338 These weirdos<br />all gotta have a name.
4468506 4469714 Mr. Jameson, Spider--
4469882 4471550 -Hoffman!<br />-Yeah?
4472760 4476471 Copyright the name "Green Goblin."<br />I want a quarter every time it's said.
4476639 4477806 How about "Green Meanie"?
4479183 4482060 Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.<br />That's slander.
4482228 4484563 It is not. I resent that.
4484814 4487566 Slander is spoken.<br />In print, it's libel.
4487775 4489401 You don't trust anybody.
4489861 4491611 I trust my barber.
4492363 4493989 What are you, his lawyer? Get out.
4494157 4496283 Let him sue me,<br />get rich like a normal person.
4496450 4498201 That's what made this country--
4506419 4509546 Jameson, you slime.
4509755 4513049 Who's the photographer<br />who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?
4513259 4515093 I don't know.<br />His stuff comes by mail.
4515261 4517179 -You're lying!<br />-I swear.
4517346 4519347 He's the one<br />who can bring me to him.
4519515 4522434 -I don't know who he is.<br />-You are useless.
4522643 4524895 Set him down, tough guy.
4525146 4529149 -Speak of the devil.<br />-I knew you two were in this together!
4529609 4532527 Hey, kiddo, let Mom and Dad<br />talk for a minute, will you?
4532737 4535197 Sleep....
4549670 4553673 Wake up, little spider. Wake up.
4553841 4558261 No, you're not dead yet.
4558471 4560639 Just paralyzed...
4560806 4562766 ...temporarily.
4563768 4566853 You're an amazing creature,<br />Spider-Man.
4567063 4569731 You and I are not so different.
4570441 4573777 I'm not like you. You're a murderer.
4573986 4576863 Well, to each his own.
4577031 4579991 I chose my path,<br />you chose the way of the hero.
4580660 4585288 And they found you amusing<br />for a while, the people of this city.
4585498 4588750 But the one thing they love<br />more than a hero...
4588960 4592545 ...is to see a hero fail,<br />fall, die trying.
4592713 4597342 In spite of everything you've done for<br />them, eventually, they will hate you.
4597510 4598510 Why bother?
4598719 4603431 -Because it's right.<br />-Here's the real truth.
4603849 4606851 There are eight million people<br />in this city.
4607061 4611356 And those teeming masses exist<br />for the sole purpose...
4611565 4615527 ...of lifting the few exceptional<br />people onto their shoulders.
4615695 4617112 You, me...
4617697 4619614 ...we're exceptional.
4619865 4624536 I could squash you like a bug<br />right now.
4624745 4628373 But l'm offering you a choice.<br />Join me.
4628582 4632168 Imagine what we could<br />accomplish together.
4632378 4635130 What we could create.
4635715 4637716 Or we could destroy.
4637883 4641845 Cause the deaths of countless<br />innocents in selfish battle...
4642054 4644472 ...again and again and again until<br />we're both dead.
4644640 4646933 Is that what you want?
4648936 4651813 Think about it, hero.
4663784 4669122 In spite of everything you've done for<br />them, eventually, they will hate you.
4678257 4679257 Hey!
4679425 4680925 -It's me again.<br />-Hey!
4681302 4682719 How was your audition?
4682928 4685930 -How'd you know?<br />-The hot line. Your mom...
4686098 4688058 ...told my aunt, told me.
4688517 4689851 So you just came by?
4690061 4693688 I was in the neighbourhood.<br />Needed to see a friendly face.
4693856 4697567 I took two buses and a cab<br />to get in the neighbourhood, but....
4698694 4700195 So how'd it go?
4702365 4704949 They said I needed acting lessons.
4705117 4708870 A soap opera told me<br />I needed acting lessons.
4709038 4714376 Let me buy you a cheeseburger.<br />The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.
4715711 4717796 I'd like a cheeseburger.
4718255 4721716 Oh, but l'm going out to dinner<br />with Harry.
4722134 4723551 Come with us.
4723719 4726471 No, thanks. How's it going with...?
4728391 4730892 Never mind.<br />That's none of my business.
4731394 4732894 It's not?
4734313 4735980 Why so interested?
4736649 4738149 I'm not.
4738401 4739776 You're not?
4741404 4744155 -Well, why would I be?<br />-I don't know.
4744407 4746199 Why would you be?
4748077 4750412 I, that's a--
4750621 4752122 I don't know.
4754333 4757168 Sorry you won't come with us.
4759630 4761589 I better run, tiger.
4770307 4772308 Hey, check it out, man.
4772476 4774144 Come on, man.
4777690 4780942 Hey, where you going, baby?<br />Come on!
4798836 4800295 Get off me!
4833579 4835079 Wait!
4839919 4842295 You have a knack<br />for getting in trouble.
4842463 4846841 You have a knack for saving my life.<br />I think I have a superhero stalker.
4847051 4848927 I was in the neighbourhood.
4850804 4853431 You are amazing.
4854391 4857101 Some people don't think so.
4858187 4861189 -But you are.<br />-Nice to have a fan.
4861941 4865151 Do I get to say thank you this time?
4866028 4867529 Wait.
4936515 4938683 Let me in! My baby's in there!
4938851 4940935 -Let me go!<br />-The roof's collapsing!
4941103 4944606 -Somebody save my baby!<br />-The roof's about to collapse!
4944815 4946149 Look! Up there!
4952823 4954616 Save my baby, please!
4978307 4979474 No!
4987191 4991194 -It's okay. Your baby's fine.<br />-Oh, my baby!
4992237 4995156 God bless you, Spider-Man.<br />Bless you.
4995407 4997116 Don't let him get away!
4997326 5000578 Hold it! You're under arrest.<br />I'm taking you in.
5000746 5002997 Oh, my God, there's somebody<br />still up there!
5005250 5006250 I'm going.
5008545 5011589 -I'll be here when you get back.<br />-Not coming back, chief.
5012007 5013132 Go! Go!
5022059 5027397 Where are you?
5032778 5035154 I'm gonna get you out of here!
5037741 5039242 It's okay.
5046291 5048876 You're pathetically predictable.
5049044 5050962 Like a moth to the flame.
5051839 5054298 What about my generous proposal?
5055342 5058177 Are you in or are you out?
5058387 5060972 It's you who's out, Gobby.<br />Out of your mind.
5061265 5063391 Wrong answer.
5064727 5066227 Oh, great.
5104892 5107685 No one says no to me!
5115027 5118446 -M.J., will you stop goofing around?<br />-Harry, relax.
5120949 5122200 He's here.
5122993 5125620 -Are you ready?<br />-Yeah.
5126330 5128998 Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.
5129208 5132293 Work was murder.<br />I picked up a fruitcake.
5132503 5135838 Thank you, Mr. Osborn.<br />We're so glad you could come.
5136173 5138883 Who is this lovely young lady?
5139051 5143346 I'd like you to meet my father.<br />Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.
5143555 5146224 I've been looking forward<br />to meeting you.
5146433 5150144 -Happy Thanksgiving, sir.<br />-Now, where is Peter?
5150312 5152688 He'd better have remembered<br />that cranberry sauce.
5158487 5162031 Oh, that's weird.<br />I didn't know he was here.
5165035 5172834 Peter?
5174586 5176295 Is that you?
5181760 5185930 How strange. There's nobody here.
5192396 5196899 -Bit of a slob, isn't he?<br />-All brilliant men are.
5229474 5232101 -Hey, everyone.<br />-Oh, Peter!
5232269 5234103 Sorry I'm late,<br />it's a jungle out there.
5234271 5238107 I had to beat an old lady with a stick<br />to get these cranberries.
5238567 5241402 Thank you.<br />Now then, everybody sit down...
5241570 5243154 ...and we can say grace.
5244740 5246324 Parker.
5246700 5248451 Here we go.
5255417 5257752 -There we are.<br />-It looks delicious.
5258253 5259754 Norman.
5261548 5263841 Will you do the honours?
5275520 5278773 Why, Peter, you're bleeding.
5280525 5282360 Oh, yeah....
5282527 5286948 I stepped off a kerb and got clipped<br />by one of those bike messengers.
5287115 5288658 Well, let me see.
5288867 5290451 Oh, my goodness.
5290619 5293037 -Oh, that looks awful.<br />-No, it's nothing.
5293205 5296332 I'll get the first-aid kit.<br />Then we'll say grace.
5296541 5301837 This is the boys' first Thanksgiving<br />here, and we'll do things properly.
5302798 5305883 How did you say that happened?
5306301 5308010 Bike messenger.
5308220 5310179 Knocked me down.
5315560 5319313 -If you'll excuse me, l've got to go.<br />-Why?
5320148 5323526 Something<br />has come to my attention.
5323735 5324986 Are you all right?
5325195 5328698 I'm fine, just fine.<br />Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.
5329324 5331701 -Enjoy the fruitcake.<br />-Dad!
5333870 5337665 I planned this so you'd meet M.J.,<br />and now you have to leave?
5337874 5339583 I've got to go.
5339876 5344005 -This girl is important to me.<br />-Harry, please. Look at her.
5344214 5348175 Think she's sniffing around<br />because she likes your personality?
5348427 5351429 -What are you saying?<br />-Your mother was beautiful too.
5351596 5352763 They're all beautiful.
5352931 5357018 Until they're snarling after your trust<br />fund like a pack of ravening wolves.
5357227 5358519 You're wrong about her, Dad.
5359021 5362189 A word to the not-so-wise<br />about your little girlfriend:
5362399 5365067 Do what you need to with her,<br />then broom her fast.
5376705 5379206 Thanks for sticking up for me,<br />Harry.
5379416 5382376 -You heard?<br />-Everyone heard that creep.
5382586 5386464 That creep is my father.<br />With luck, I'll be half of what he is.
5386715 5389050 Shut up about stuff<br />you don't understand!
5389217 5390885 Harry Osborn!
5391970 5394013 I'm sorry, Aunt May.
5396975 5400311 Spider-Man is all but invincible.
5400479 5403647 But Parker, we can destroy him.
5403815 5405149 I can't.
5405317 5408319 Betrayal<br />must not be countenanced.
5408570 5410821 Parker must be educated.
5412991 5414283 What do I do?
5414493 5418579 Instruct him in the matters<br />of loss and pain.
5418747 5421791 Make him suffer.<br />Make him wish he were dead.
5422042 5423334 Yes?
5423502 5425419 And then grant his wish.
5426338 5427630 But how?
5427839 5432134 The cunning warrior attacks<br />neither body nor mind.
5432344 5433511 Tell me how!
5433678 5435846 The heart, Osborn.
5436098 5439141 First, we attack his heart.
5441019 5444522 Give us this day our daily bread,<br />and forgive us our trespasses...
5444731 5447691 ...as we forgive those<br />who trespass against us.
5447984 5450945 Lead us not into temptation,<br />but deliver us--
5459538 5462081 Deliver us!
5462290 5463666 Finish it!
5463959 5467878 -Finish it!<br />-From evil!
5473593 5475761 Two milligrams lV.
5477556 5478806 Get the BP.
5479224 5482810 Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?<br />What happened?
5483019 5484353 You have to leave.
5484521 5486230 -What happened?<br />-Those eyes!
5486439 5490484 Those horrible yellow eyes!
5495323 5497867 He knows who I am.
5541828 5543412 I'm sorry.
5547125 5549585 -Will she be okay?<br />-She's gonna be fine.
5549753 5552421 She's been sleeping all day.
5553423 5556175 -Thanks for coming.<br />-Of course.
5560347 5563265 How are you?<br />You okay about the other night?
5563433 5567102 Yeah, l'm fine. I just felt bad<br />about leaving Aunt May.
5567354 5570314 -Have you talked to Harry?<br />-He called me.
5570774 5572942 I haven't called him back.
5575028 5576737 The fact is...
5577906 5580741 -...I'm in love with somebody else.<br />-You are?
5580909 5582117 At least I think I am.
5584788 5587831 -It's not the right time to talk about it.<br />-No. Go on.
5587999 5591252 Would I know his name, this guy?
5591461 5594338 You'll think I'm a stupid little girl<br />with a crush.
5594506 5595881 Trust me.
5596132 5597383 It's funny.
5599386 5602763 He's saved my life twice,<br />and I've never even seen his face.
5603515 5606892 -Oh. Him.<br />-You're laughing at me.
5607102 5610062 No, I understand.<br />He is extremely cool.
5610272 5613565 But do you think it's true, all the<br />terrible things they say about him?
5613733 5617653 No, no. Not Spider-Man,<br />not a chance in the world.
5617862 5619488 I know him a little bit.
5619698 5622574 I'm sort of his unofficial<br />photographer.
5622784 5625911 -Has he mentioned me?<br />-Yeah.
5626246 5627705 What'd he say?
5628290 5629623 I said....
5630709 5635004 He asked me<br />what I thought about you.
5635922 5637965 And what did you say?
5638675 5642761 I said, "Spider-Man."
5643096 5647975 I said, "The great thing about M.J...
5650645 5653897 ...when you look in her eyes...
5656443 5659653 ...and she's looking back in yours...
5660655 5663657 ...everything feels...
5664868 5666702 ...not quite normal.
5667954 5669747 Because you feel...
5670290 5671915 ...stronger...
5673460 5677087 ...and weaker at the same time.
5678131 5680257 You feel excited...
5681134 5683177 ...and at the same time...
5683803 5685429 ...terrified.
5687766 5692061 The truth is, you don't know<br />what you feel...
5693480 5697107 ...except you know what kind of man<br />you want to be.
5699819 5701695 It's as if you've...
5702322 5705491 ...reached the unreachable...
5707077 5709787 ...and you weren't ready for it."
5713249 5715000 You said that?
5715794 5718128 Well, something like that.
5762424 5763924 Dad?
5769264 5771348 Dad, is that you?
5777939 5779440 What is it?
5781693 5786697 Well, you were right about M.J.<br />You're right about everything.
5787699 5790409 She's in love with Peter.
5790702 5792494 -Parker?<br />-Yeah.
5792662 5794621 And how does he feel about her?
5797208 5799751 He's loved her since the 4th grade.
5800712 5805966 He pretends like he doesn't, but<br />there's no one Peter cares for more.
5808887 5810637 I'm so sorry.
5813099 5816560 I haven't always been there for you,<br />have I?
5818313 5821523 You're busy. You're an important man.<br />I understand.
5821733 5823525 That's no excuse.
5824527 5826320 I'm proud of you.
5826863 5831742 I've lost sight of that somewhere.<br />But I'll make it up to you.
5831910 5835245 I'm going to rectify<br />certain inequities.
5849302 5851094 Wake up, little spider.
5851262 5852763 Wake up.
5854098 5855682 Go home, dear.
5855892 5857226 You look awful.
5857435 5859728 -And you look beautiful.<br />-Well, thank you.
5859938 5863232 -I don't like to leave you here.<br />-But l'm safe here.
5863399 5866109 -Can I do anything for you?<br />-You do too much.
5866277 5871823 College, a job, all this time with me.<br />You're not Superman, you know.
5872575 5874326 A smile. Finally.
5874494 5877746 Haven't seen one of those on<br />your face since Mary Jane was here.
5877914 5881291 Hey.<br />You were supposed to be asleep.
5882085 5886880 You know, you were about 6 years old<br />when M.J.'s family moved in next door.
5887090 5891051 And when she got out of the car,<br />and you saw her for the first time...
5891219 5897558 ...you grabbed me and said,<br />"Aunt May, is that an angel?"
5897767 5901311 -Gee, did I say that?<br />-You sure did.
5903982 5906733 Well, Harry's in love with her.
5906943 5910696 -She's still his girl.<br />-Well, isn't that up to her?
5910905 5915492 -She doesn't really know who I am.<br />-Because you won't let her.
5915702 5918829 You're so mysterious all the time.
5919080 5921832 Tell me, would it be so dangerous...
5922041 5926003 ...to let Mary Jane know<br />how much you care?
5926421 5928922 Everybody else knows.
5931968 5933218 I'll be right back.
5933886 5935178 But....
5942520 5944521 Come on, pick up.
5944689 5947983 -Hey, M.J.--<br />-Sing your song at the beep.
5949027 5951069 M.J., it's Peter. You there?
5951362 5954197 Hello? You there?
5954699 5959202 I'm just calling to check up on you.<br />Will you call me when you get in?
5959370 5960787 All right, well....
5960955 5962247 Don't....
5963041 5965250 Don't go up any dark alleys.
5965460 5966960 Hello?
5969380 5973091 Can Spider-Man come out to play?
5973301 5975052 Where is she?
6021307 6022974 -What is that?<br />-That's cool!
6023184 6027813 The itsy-bitsy spider<br />Went up the water spout
6027980 6032150 Down came the goblin<br />And took the spider out
6048960 6050669 Goblin, what have you done?
6093171 6097007 Spider-Man!<br />This is why only fools are heroes.
6097425 6099009 Because you never know...
6099218 6104014 ...when some lunatic will come along<br />with a sadistic choice:
6105099 6107684 Let die the woman you love...
6112064 6117152 ...or suffer the little children.
6119530 6121990 -Spider-Man!<br />-Save us!
6122533 6124785 Save us!
6125036 6127621 Make your choice, Spider-Man...
6127830 6131208 ...and see how a hero is rewarded.
6131375 6133460 Don't do it, Goblin!
6133628 6136546 We are who we choose to be.
6136798 6139549 -Now, choose!<br />-No!
6168246 6169830 Everybody stay still!
6179340 6180674 Ahoy up there!
6180842 6183760 We're gonna bring the barge<br />right under you.
6191269 6195397 -He's coming back!<br />-Listen. I need you to climb down.
6195565 6197065 -I can't.<br />-Yes, you can!
6202154 6205198 M.J., you can do it. You have to.
6205366 6206950 Trust me.
6208452 6212289 Hold on tight and go quickly.
6216627 6218670 -Hurry!<br />-I can't. I can't do it.
6218880 6220547 Hang on, Mary Jane!
6248993 6251620 -He's not gonna make it.<br />-He's gonna make it!
6261505 6264716 It's time to die.
6271724 6274184 Come on up here, tough guy,<br />I got something for you!
6274352 6275560 We ought to kick your ass!
6275770 6279147 Leave Spider-Man alone! You're<br />gonna pick on a guy saving kids?
6279815 6281274 I got something for your ass!
6281442 6283318 Mess with Spidey,<br />you mess with New York!
6283486 6285946 You mess with one of us,<br />you mess with all of us!
6299543 6301336 Spider-Man, watch out!
6333202 6337455 Misery, misery, misery.<br />That's what you've chosen.
6338374 6341001 I offered you friendship...
6341168 6343044 ...and you spat in my face.
6394138 6397807 You've spun your last web,<br />Spider-Man.
6397975 6401311 Had you not been so selfish,<br />your little girlfriend's death...
6401479 6403188 ...would have been quick<br />and painless.
6403355 6406733 But now that you've really<br />pissed me off...
6406984 6411863 ...I'm gonna finish her<br />nice and slow.
6416452 6418495 M.J. and I...
6419330 6422624 ...we're gonna have a hell of a time.
6476428 6477971 Peter, stop!
6478139 6480598 Stop! It's me.
6489567 6490984 Mr. Osborn.
6491193 6492777 Peter, thank God for you.
6492987 6495280 You killed those people<br />on that balcony.
6495489 6498533 The Goblin killed!<br />I had nothing to do with it!
6498701 6500451 Don't let him take me again.
6500619 6502662 I beg you. Protect me.
6502830 6506374 You tried to kill Aunt May.<br />You tried to kill Mary Jane.
6506584 6508084 But not you.
6508752 6512714 I tried to stop it.<br />But I couldn't stop it.
6512923 6515008 I would never hurt you.
6515217 6517135 I knew from the beginning...
6517344 6520263 ...if anything ever happened to me...
6520431 6522599 ...it was you I could count on.
6522766 6526102 You, Peter Parker, would save me,<br />and so you have.
6526687 6528521 Thank God for you.
6529523 6530940 Give me your hand.
6532109 6535528 Believe in me<br />as I believed in you.
6536947 6539741 I've been like a father to you.
6541285 6542952 Be a son to me now.
6544747 6546623 I have a father.
6547374 6549876 His name was Ben Parker.
6551754 6553213 Godspeed, Spider-Man.
6572149 6573650 Peter.
6575986 6577278 Don't tell Harry.
6609520 6611229 What have you done?
6611397 6612981 What have you done?!
6636255 6637755 Hey.
6641135 6643177 I'm so sorry, Harry.
6644096 6647223 I know what it's like<br />to lose a father.
6649393 6652687 I didn't lose him.<br />He was stolen from me.
6654273 6656566 One day Spider-Man will pay.
6658444 6661571 I swear on my father's grave,<br />Spider-Man will pay.
6666577 6668411 Thank God for you, Peter.
6669121 6671581 You're the only family I have.
6696106 6698399 No matter what I do...
6698567 6701694 ...no matter how hard I try...
6702279 6706115 ...the ones I love will always<br />be the ones who pay.
6716835 6719170 You must miss him so much.
6720130 6723174 It's been so hard without him.
6726095 6728971 There's something<br />I've been wanting to tell you.
6730766 6732600 When I was up there...
6733310 6736104 ...and I thought I was gonna die...
6737731 6740483 ...there was only one person<br />who I was thinking of.
6742861 6746072 And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.
6747533 6749492 It was you, Pete.
6750828 6752703 I kept thinking:
6753122 6755915 "l hope I make it through this...
6757376 6761754 ...so I can see Peter Parker's face<br />one more time."
6763132 6764632 Really?
6765008 6770805 There's only one man<br />who's always been there for me...
6772057 6774016 ...who makes me feel...
6774476 6778187 ...like l'm more than I ever<br />thought I could be.
6780315 6781983 That I'm just...
6782651 6784152 ...me.
6785237 6787155 And that's okay.
6789324 6790825 The truth is...
6792953 6794745 ...I love you.
6796832 6798791 I love you so much, Peter.
6819480 6824275 All I wanted was to tell her<br />how much I loved her.
6824443 6826360 I can't.
6828489 6830031 You can't what?
6831158 6832617 Tell you...
6834328 6838581 ...everything.<br />I mean, there's so much to tell.
6839750 6843669 Yeah. There's so much to tell.
6844588 6846589 I want you to know...
6846965 6849634 ...that I will always be there<br />for you.
6849843 6853804 I will always be there<br />to take care of you.
6854806 6856807 I promise you that.
6860103 6862396 I will always be your friend.
6865317 6867193 Only a friend...
6868070 6869612 ...Peter Parker?
6871782 6874617 That's all I have to give.
6900978 6903646 Whatever life holds in store<br />for me...
6903814 6906691 ...l will never forget these words:
6906900 6911946 "With great power<br />comes great responsibility."
6912114 6914365 This is my gift.
6914533 6916659 My curse.
6917160 6919078 Who am l?
6919454 6920830 I'm Spider-Man.
