2295 3838 Hello, my name is Sam Raimi.
4005 8259 I'm the director of Spider-Man,<br />which you paid too much money to see.
8426 14432 With me is my good friend and<br />co-producer, Grant Curtis.
14599 19729 And I'm Laura Ziskin, and I'm here at<br />the Sony Studios with Kirsten Dunst.
19896 23941 We're gonna talk about Spider-Man.<br />We're at Sony, where we spent...
24108 27737 ...most of last year<br />making the Spider-Man movie.
27904 34535 Kyle Cooper, who did the titles to the<br />movie, created this logo for Marvel...
34702 37038 ...which has gotten an ovation<br />in the theaters.
37205 42251 The first time we showed the movie,<br />people clapped for that Marvel logo.
53346 58226 We're recording this from ADR <i>2</i><br />on the Columbia Pictures lot...
58392 62271 ...which is next to the scoring stage.<br />It's a black box.
62438 65316 Do a lot of voice work for pictures.
65483 69320 Grant, what are your thoughts<br />about this opening title sequence?
69487 75326 Beautiful title sequence designed by<br />Kyle Cooper and Imaginary Forces.
75493 77328 Very well done.
77495 82625 He worked tirelessly with a great team<br />of artists creating this. It took months.
82792 87588 Return trips to the editing room, back<br />into his world, and back to editing room.
87755 93177 A lot of artists and technicians spent<br />a lot of time crafting this sequence.
93344 96472 We didn't want to show<br />Spider-Man early in the movie...
96639 98975 ...because it was his origin story.
99141 102520 But we wanted to give<br />the audience a taste of him.
102687 107358 So we tried to design with Kyle<br />and his team some sequence...
107525 110027 ...that would give the audience...
110194 114115 ...the flavor of the character<br />without actually...
114282 118286 ...spoiling the big reveal<br />of Spider-Man before it was due.
118452 121163 I think this is one of the best<br />title sequences...
121330 124875 ...I've ever seen in my entire life,<br />of any film.
125459 129463 When I first came on the movie,<br />Sam said the way he likes to work...
129630 133801 ...is to have two editors.<br />They each work individually.
133968 140057 And then he sees both of their cuts and<br />both of their materials, scene for scene.
140224 144061 And then at the end<br />of the first cutting process...
144228 147148 ...he'll screen the two movies<br />back to back, the two cuts.
147315 151319 Then, in his words, he then<br />likes to "mush them together."
151527 152695 I can tell.
152862 157575 I think it's such a smart idea to have<br />those two different perspectives.
160244 163706 It's a great honor to have a chance<br />to make Spider-Man...
163873 168419 ...and work briefly with Stan Lee.<br />He's one of my childhood heroes.
168586 173341 He created some of the greatest<br />fiction characters...
173507 176218 ...in American comic book history.
176385 180431 That was my favorite day on the set,<br />when he came by. That was bizarre.
180598 183434 - What was that like?<br />- It was just...
183601 188564 You guys were in watching dailies,<br />and I waited outside for Stan.
188731 191567 He showed up while you guys<br />were in dailies.
191734 193944 The whole crew had broken for lunch.
194111 198032 And I just showed Stan around<br />the Times Square set out in Downey.
198199 202620 And it was very bizarre introducing<br />the creator of Spider-Man...
202787 206707 ...to the world of Spider-Man<br />on the film set.
206874 209710 He just walked around<br />with a big smile on his face.
209877 211962 He was thoroughly pleased.
212129 215132 - Was it what he had hoped it would be?<br />- It was, and more.
215299 217802 I mean, he could tell that...
218010 222098 ...everybody was putting 100 percent<br />effort into making his vision...
222264 224433 ...and your vision come through<br />on screen.
224600 227561 He knew it was being<br />well taken care of.
228771 229939 <i>That's me.</i>
230147 232024 Tell him to stop! Please!
232233 233442 Stop!
233651 235820 Hey! Stop the bus!
236028 239448 Stop! He's been chasing us<br />since Woodhaven Boulevard.
239615 242660 This was shot in Queens, New York.
242827 246455 On the right is my brother<br />and his family...
246622 251168 - ...walking, as cameos.<br />- That was Ivan? Oh, my gosh.
251335 254463 And little Max and Sophie and Kyle.
254672 259343 One of the very first storyboards<br />that I saw in the movie...
259593 263681 ...was the design of the scene<br />of Peter chasing the bus.
263848 270312 And of the sort of, shall we say,<br />portly young man eating the doughnut.
270563 274942 It was really fun to see it<br />come to life because it's exactly...
275192 280197 ...as he storyboarded it, brought to life<br />by these lovely performances...
280448 283993 ...and the music and everything.<br />It's fun.
284160 289874 I came into the movie<br />in July of...
290082 292501 What year are we in? 2000.
292710 296505 And Sony had already made<br />a decision to make the film.
296714 299175 They were in the early stages<br />of preproduction.
299341 303012 Nobody had been...<br />The movie hadn't been cast yet...
303220 307725 ...and the script was in a state of flux.<br />That was when I came on to it.
307892 313022 Avi Arad, the executive producer,<br />has been with it for many years.
313189 316901 And it's sort of folklore now<br />about how long it's taken...
317067 321238 ...to bring Spider-Man to the screen.<br />I guess 18 years or so...
321405 325242 ...from when they first made<br />a decision to try to make the movie.
325409 329580 And we have all sort of only<br />half-jokingly said...
329747 332666 ...it was a good thing<br />it took this long to get made...
332833 336712 ...because the technology<br />didn't really exist...
336921 342676 ...to have Spider-Man do the things<br />that the fans would expect him to do.
343636 347389 It was exciting to shoot this<br />at Columbia University in New York.
348057 350434 The light kept changing<br />when we were shooting.
350726 355356 Caused tremendous amounts<br />of problems for Don Burgess...
355564 357441 ...and the gaffers, grips.
357650 359902 Willem did a wonderful job<br />in this picture.
360069 364573 He is both warm and intelligent,<br />sweet in this scene.
364782 367618 That was necessary<br />because we really needed Peter...
367785 372164 ...to look up to the character<br />of Norman Osborn.
372373 376710 In some ways, Norman was supposed to<br />be Pete's surrogate father in the piece.
376877 380130 So Willem Dafoe had to have<br />those qualities.
380297 383676 At the same time, he had to be<br />incredibly physically adept...
383842 386262 ...to be able to ride<br />that goblin glider...
386428 389390 ...in that incredible suit.
389598 394061 It was like riding a mechanical bull<br />from those bars in the Southwest.
394228 398399 Took an incredible amount<br />of muscle ability and coordination.
398566 402319 The third thing we needed for that actor<br />to pull this role off...
402486 407658 ...was, he had to have a great deal<br />of menace to threaten Spider-Man.
407825 411495 Willem pulled all three<br />of those qualities together...
411662 414957 ...and delivered quite well<br />in his performance.
415207 418586 This scene inside was,<br />of course, shot...
418752 423007 ...months and months<br />before in a location in Los Angeles.
423173 428220 - Right near USC, right?<br />- Right. In the Natural History Museum.
430097 434518 This was during night shooting. I was<br />so tired because we worked all night.
434727 438856 It was split days. This was probably at 2<br />in the morning when we were doing this.
439106 441275 It was because of the museum...
441734 448532 ...and when we could have control of<br />certain parts of it. We had to be at night.
448741 452453 And these were the days<br />when we had the spider guy.
452620 455998 - Oh, right.<br />- Steve Kutcher, who was...
456165 459043 - The spider wrangler.<br />- ...wrangling the spiders.
459209 460252 Let's go.
460419 464590 ...Hunts using reflexes with<br />nerve-conduction velocity so fast...
464757 468510 I had a great team<br />of second unit directors...
468719 472181 ...who put together a lot<br />of the pieces of these spiders for me.
472348 476477 Doug Lefter did an excellent job. He was<br />one of my chief storyboard artists...
476685 480898 ...and great second unit directors,<br />and so was Jeff Lynch.
481065 483317 He shot some of those spiders.
483484 486236 And then we also had John Dykstra...
486403 490699 ...who did additional second unit<br />photography as a director.
490908 494244 Dick Buckley did an excellent<br />job shooting on this picture.
494411 497247 Delivered some great footage<br />for that montage...
497414 499416 ...of people speaking<br />about Spider-Man...
499583 504046 ...in the second act. He shot a lot<br />of that stuff. Most of that stuff.
504213 509009 Sam was very fixed on what<br />the spider would look like...
509176 511512 ...that would bite Peter.
511679 517434 And we were shooting in the winter,<br />and spiders are summer critters.
517601 522523 So the spider wrangler had to go to New<br />Zealand and Australia to get spiders.
522690 527277 He came in the first day to see us<br />with this box full of spiders.
527444 531949 And we all sat there slightly repulsed<br />and slightly mesmerized...
532116 534743 ...as he played with his spiders.
536120 537913 Neil did a beautiful job.
538080 541291 And his team created things<br />like this web.
541458 546296 Did a beautiful job out of monofilament<br />and, I think, a hot glue gun.
548757 555264 He worked closely with our special<br />effects house and John Frazier...
555431 557975 ...making all those webs.
558851 562146 I think she's so charming,<br />along with Tobey, in this scene.
562312 565399 They really give a lot of themselves.<br />He's so afraid to ask.
565566 569361 He knows it's his chance,<br />and he can't let it pass him by.
574658 578454 Could I take your picture?<br />I need one with a student in it.
578620 580080 - Sure. Yeah.<br />- Great.
580289 582583 Where do you want me? Over here?
582791 584126 Yeah, that's great.
584501 586170 Don't make me look ugly.
586587 588422 That's impossible.
595679 596930 Perfect.
604688 606190 - Is that good?<br />- Great.
611779 613155 That's great.
616492 619161 I didn't really know a ton<br />about Mary Jane.
619411 622790 I had seen more Gwen Stacy,<br />for some odd reason.
622956 626877 When I first met Sam, I was just<br />flipping through the comics.
627044 630130 I saw her and I was like,<br />"All right, I'm blond. Makes sense."
630297 633300 I didn't know a lot about<br />Mary Jane and Peter's relationship.
633509 637513 But of course I did lots of research<br />after I got the role.
638055 643352 A lot of that is the real spider. A black<br />widow with a "dress" put over it.
643519 647064 A little shell snapped over the abdomen<br />of the spider...
647231 651527 ...so we could paint the shell<br />without harming the actual spider.
651735 656406 But sometimes that spider is created<br />with the help of John Dykstra...
656573 661245 ...and his incredible CGI team<br />of artists and technicians.
661453 666500 And I thought they did a great job<br />matching the real spider.
666667 669336 General Slocum,<br />good to see you again.
670170 672339 Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.
672589 674424 - Norman.<br />- Mr. Osborn.
674591 678095 Always a pleasure to have<br />our board of directors visit.
678345 681765 I want to see the progress report<br />on human performance enhancers.
682975 687396 Neil Spisak did a lot of research<br />on putting together this lab.
687563 691233 What his research told him was<br />these projects come and go...
691400 694778 ...so quickly that everything<br />was gonna be on wheels.
695237 698907 Nothing permanent. Everything<br />Jerry-rigged and brought in on carts...
699575 701451 ...and rolling platforms.
701618 706039 I thought that was so unlike what I had<br />seen in the movies, and so dead on.
706206 708125 ...Our entire staff certifies<br />the product...
708292 711003 - ...ready for human testing.<br />- Dr. Stromm?
712296 716008 We need to take the whole line<br />back to formula.
717259 719636 - Back to formula?<br />- Dr. Osborn.
720804 722639 I'll be frank with you.
722931 727769 I never supported your program. We<br />have my predecessor to thank for that.
727936 730647 The general has approved<br />Quest Aerospace...
730814 733775 ...to build a prototype<br />of their exoskeleton design.
734109 737988 - They test in two weeks.<br />- And if your performance enhancers...
738155 742284 ...have not had a successful<br />human trial by that date...
742534 746914 ...I'm gonna pull your funding.<br />I'm going to give it to them.
748665 750334 Gentlemen. Ladies.
755464 760844 And the Lord said, "Let there be light."<br />And voile! There is light.
761970 766183 I love Cliff Robertson.<br />He's an old-school gentleman.
766350 771605 Great actor, and he's got<br />a really good soul, that fellow.
771772 776777 He really brought a lot of life<br />to a part...
776944 780364 ...that was just a very simple role.
780530 784117 He infused it with a great deal<br />of warmth and love...
784326 786536 ...and that's what it's all about.
786703 791291 He really made me miss him<br />when he was gone in the story.
791458 793502 Well, let's look in the paper and see.
794628 797381 There are the want ads.<br />What do we got here?
797589 799216 Computer...
799383 803178 Computer salesman, computer<br />engineer, computer analyst.
803345 807099 My Lord, even the computers<br />need analysts these days.
807391 810727 I'm 68. I'm too old for computers,<br />and besides, I...
810894 814231 This moment when May says to him...<br />Comforts him.
814398 817401 He realizes in the performance<br />that she's right here.
817567 819820 Listen. Watch him listen to her.
819987 823907 We've been down-and-out before.<br />But somehow, we survive.
825075 827035 Hi, sweetie. You're just...
827202 830872 He really is in the moment. He takes in<br />what the other actors say...
831039 834584 ...and reacts to it in a realistic way.
835252 838505 Rosemary gives him great stuff<br />to act off of. She was great.
838672 844052 - Did you get some pictures, Peter?<br />- I gotta crash. Everything's fine.
845429 847055 What's that all about?
852769 854021 We like this scene.
854187 857232 That's the computerized body<br />on Tobey.
857399 861236 - Don't give away the secrets.<br />- Same with the buff one. Just joking.
861403 865699 We did have the body double<br />for Tobey when he was skinny.
865866 869286 - Sam will get mad at me for telling this.<br />- Oh, well.
869453 871955 He didn't think the guy<br />was skinny enough.
872164 877127 - He said, "I want somebody skinnier."<br />- Then his head would look huge.
877294 879463 Our editor,<br />Bob Murawski did a great job...
879629 881715 ...putting this<br />dream sequence together.
881882 887929 We really didn't have the money left to<br />do what we wanted to do, so it was cut.
888096 891808 But Bob scrapped together pieces...
891975 894936 ...from titles, stock footage...
895103 899983 ...that was used in Darkman,<br />an old picture I worked on with Bob...
900192 904071 ...and some new graphics and even<br />a shot from an old Italian horror picture.
904237 907407 - Which shot was that?<br />- The eyeball with the spider on it.
907574 913080 I don't know if it's a Lucio Fulci<br />picture, or some other film.
913246 915165 But that's where that's from.
915332 918752 Let me reschedule, with a proper<br />medical staff and a volunteer.
918919 921338 - Just give me two weeks.<br />- Two weeks?
921505 925258 In two weeks we'll have lost<br />the contract to Quest...
925425 929679 There's so much going on with<br />John Frazier's mechanical effects.
929846 934267 All the precision timing he's got going<br />with the computers...
934476 937687 ...and this table bed<br />and the doors shutting.
937854 943985 It's really a beautiful work of art he put<br />together to make all this look so great.
958041 959376 Oh, that's cold.
998498 1001501 We really wanted to get<br />this green gas, but...
1001668 1005755 Every time we did a test with the green<br />smoke, it was terribly toxic.
1005922 1009593 Every combination we used<br />with mechanical effects.
1009759 1013680 Finally, at the last minute,<br />we had to just use the white...
1013847 1017267 ...I think, liquid nitrogen...
1017517 1022522 ...and then colorize it. Colorize it<br />as a postproduction effect.
1023607 1024941 Norman!
1026109 1027652 Norman!
1035619 1036953 Oh, my God.
1038455 1039915 Oh, my God.
1040081 1041082 Norman?
1041249 1045462 That was a hard surface to light<br />because it has so many angles of glass.
1046922 1049883 Kept seeing a lot of reflections.
1056264 1059601 - This scene makes everybody jump.<br />- Yes.
1059768 1061978 - It's scary.<br />- It is scary.
1062562 1064564 That looks so good.
1064731 1068485 Great stunt pulled off by<br />Jeff Habberstad and his guys...
1068652 1071363 ...going through that window.
1071947 1074574 This was really fun.<br />This was something we tested...
1074741 1080622 ...early on with this giant pair<br />of glasses in front of the camera. Yeah.
1082499 1087629 Basically Tobey had a large pair<br />of glasses that he would hold up.
1087796 1091508 And then the cameraman would<br />rack focus and go back, blurring it...
1091675 1095845 ...as the lenses came into frame<br />to pull off the illusion of out of focus.
1096012 1098181 His eyes being out of focus.
1102894 1108525 Now something you maybe don't notice,<br />but look really closely at his wallpaper.
1108775 1114489 Can you tell what the design is on the<br />wallpaper? It's little spider webs. Yeah.
1114698 1116324 I'm fine.
1118410 1121913 - You can't really tell. But it's there.<br />- You can't really tell.
1122080 1124749 Neil Spisak,<br />who designed the production...
1124916 1127127 ...it's his little secret.
1137053 1142309 This was all done on a set. The entire<br />house on the Columbia Pictures lot.
1142475 1144060 This bedroom.
1145770 1147147 Okay.
1151234 1155155 Jeff designed that for us.<br />Our stunt coordinator.
1155322 1159909 The distance between the rail and the<br />wall so Tobey could learn that stunt...
1160076 1162746 ...of running along the wall.
1165540 1167876 Neil did a great job with their house.
1168084 1172213 Every time I see this I think I'm<br />walking in my grandparents' house.
1173173 1176092 Neil and his art director<br />really studied the homes...
1176259 1178553 ...in Queens<br />where this exterior was shot.
1178762 1184267 And really patterned it precisely<br />after the interior decors...
1184476 1188897 ...and the ad-on front porch made<br />into an entry hall, all those details.
1189064 1191775 The cracking plaster...
1191941 1196488 The mix of wallpaper and paint...
1197030 1200450 ...from different eras<br />where the front was added on.
1201284 1202952 Hi, M.J.
1203787 1205288 Hey, M.J.
1205580 1208792 I don't know if you realize this,<br />but we've been neighbors...
1209000 1211628 Our prop guy was driving this bus.
1211795 1213213 Yeah. Martin.
1213380 1217133 He's a brilliant prop guy, but...
1217300 1222764 Let's just leave it at that.<br />I never heard such grinding of gears.
1226559 1231272 This was actually originally planned<br />to be a more elaborate scene...
1231439 1236820 ...where he more than just...
1237028 1240448 Than sticking to the banner.
1240615 1244744 He was then gonna leap<br />out of the way of a truck.
1244911 1249624 But we ended up cutting it<br />both for budgetary and time purposes.
1249791 1252001 - It's better subtle, though.<br />- It worked.
1252168 1256047 It would've been too much<br />with him jumping the bus too.
1261469 1264597 Osborn's mansion was also designed<br />and shot...
1264764 1268518 ...here on the Columbia Pictures lot<br />in Culver City.
1268685 1270770 This interior.
1272063 1276192 Danny Elf man saw this place<br />and said, "I want to live there."
1276359 1280697 I thought, "That's the villain's home.<br />You don't wanna live there."
1280864 1283825 He loved the design<br />of this particular room.
1284033 1287954 In this room you'll see a wide variety<br />of masks Karen O'Hara...
1288121 1291499 ...our set decorator,<br />went to great pains to get.
1291666 1295378 Some are quite valuable,<br />and they're all quite beautiful.
1295587 1299215 They did a really great job<br />with the background stuff...
1299466 1304345 ...telling the story of his love<br />of masks and tribal masks.
1305722 1309184 That's Bill Paxton's dad there.<br />I love that guy.
1309350 1313521 - John Paxton.<br />- He's great. He's in <i>A Simple</i> Plan too.
1314230 1318318 He argues with Bill about feed,<br />for the day of the month.
1318485 1321488 That's right. He's really funny<br />in that picture.
1328912 1333374 Not CGI, by the way. That little<br />catch thing. That's all Tobey.
1333541 1337378 - That's real.<br />- Which is pretty impressive.
1337629 1342759 And they put sticky glue stuff<br />to stick his hand to the tray too.
1342926 1347430 - Many takes of those items falling.<br />- Yeah, yeah, there was.
1347639 1351267 This was actually a scene that...
1351434 1354938 We had the scene and what<br />subsequently transpires...
1355104 1359567 ...but the studio had asked us<br />to actually cut the tray part.
1359734 1363029 Because we'd originally had two days<br />scheduled for the scene.
1363196 1368785 And then in the, you know,<br />the vicissitudes of production...
1368952 1371538 ...we had to cut some time.<br />They wanted us to cut a day.
1371704 1374958 So we made it that we would<br />shoot it in one day.
1375166 1378962 That part was gonna have to go,<br />but Sam and I really wanted it.
1379254 1382382 So we said, "Well, we're gonna<br />do it anyway."
1382590 1385927 So we did shoot this scene<br />in one extremely long day.
1386094 1389222 Remember how long?<br />It was, like, a 16-hour day.
1389389 1392934 - But thank God we did it.<br />- Because people love that.
1393101 1397313 It's used as a clip whenever<br />we do publicity. People love that scene.
1397480 1401818 It's so cute because he's learning<br />his powers and he saves her.
1402277 1403945 Parker?
1411953 1416958 This school was also built by Neil on<br />a stage here at Columbia. I love this set.
1417458 1420962 This 1952 school hall.
1429470 1433349 That sequence of the spidey-sense<br />was something...
1433516 1437186 ...we began designing<br />actually kind of late.
1437353 1441316 We were in production already. The<br />shot was one of the last things finished.
1441524 1444736 It wasn't the absolute last.<br />The absolute last thing finished...
1444902 1446821 ...was the very last shot of the movie.
1447030 1451993 Which took 18 months from the time<br />we started talking about it...
1452201 1458124 It was the last thing that came in.<br />But this was also... Came in quite late.
1458291 1463338 John composited all these pieces.<br />Shot the fist. Shot the background.
1463504 1468051 He really did an excellent job<br />putting these effects together for us.
1470637 1476309 I loved your idea there of showing<br />Peter's POV while in mid-backstand.
1476893 1481356 - Looking up at M.J. is a great shot.<br />- You know who... That was...
1482315 1485860 ...Don Burgess' idea:<br />"Let's pick up a piece...
1486027 1489781 ...of Peter's point of view."<br />I thought that was a great idea.
1490990 1494661 Joe, who plays Flash,<br />he was an unconventional choice...
1494911 1497997 ...because he didn't look like<br />the Flash in the comic book.
1498164 1501834 But we just liked him.<br />Thought he had a great quality.
1504504 1507757 Watching Tobey think on screen.
1509217 1511594 He's got so much going on.
1516307 1519727 I love, in that sequence, how he's<br />coming to realize his powers...
1519894 1522730 ...but he doesn't quite know<br />what's happening.
1522897 1525358 But he's kind of secretly thrilled.
1525525 1528611 Once he finally delivers<br />that knockout punch...
1528820 1535034 ...he's stunned, and he transitions<br />into, like, "Oh, yeah."
1535201 1539080 And then this fear starts<br />to creep over him.
1539414 1543960 This change is happening to him,<br />and that sort of overwhelms him...
1544544 1548005 ...and the confusion of that drives him<br />out. He plays it all silently.
1548172 1549674 Yeah, he's great.
1556931 1559726 I want more wall-climbing<br />in the sequel.
1559892 1562437 - I know. I love this.<br />- Climbing is the best part.
1562603 1564439 I get excited every time.
1564605 1570069 Like when Uncle Ben is killed, and he's<br />hopping and climbing. It's so exciting.
1570236 1572321 It's hot.
1573239 1576576 I have a funny story, actually...
1576743 1581164 ...about the wall-climbing<br />that comes later. I'll tell it later.
1591340 1595094 Tobey was on a treadmill<br />to do those few runs.
1595303 1600767 This was a really complicated business,<br />to get this sequence.
1601017 1606189 Isn't it sad? It's so much work and<br />nobody realizes it, for split seconds.
1606355 1611778 - It's better they don't know.<br />- But they'll appreciate it on the DVD.
1611986 1613029 Go, web!
1613196 1616991 - I love this. This is hilarious.<br />- This is really cute.
1617825 1619911 Up, up and away, web.
1621662 1626793 This is Tobey improvising,<br />with much encouragement from Sam.
1627460 1632131 Tobey can be so funny.<br />He's really funny.
1632340 1637178 He's really a great Peter Parker.<br />He's really amazing.
1637345 1639013 Amazing.
1642683 1647814 This was hard because it was<br />the first place where we see the webs.
1647980 1651400 And among the many challenges<br />of the movie...
1651567 1655947 ...certainly making something<br />that looks like a web...
1656155 1661410 ...that a human-sized Spider-Man<br />could swing from was a big challenge.
1661577 1667250 And a combination of, obviously,<br />practical webs and CG.
1668751 1670920 - This is really funny.<br />- I know.
1673172 1677218 I love that the next shot's like,<br />running home. It's like such a little boy.
1677385 1680888 Like, "I'm hurt. I'm hurting.<br />I'm running home."
1685434 1687770 We painted an image on the wall...
1687937 1691858 ...and we'd had various ideas<br />for what that should be.
1692024 1694777 Then Neil came up with this notion...
1694986 1699907 ...that it's for a talk radio...
1700074 1704245 Drive-time radio show, and it's<br />the spider on the windshield.
1704412 1708082 - As Kirsten pointed out.<br />- Well, no, it just came to me.
1708291 1711752 I was like, "Oh, my God,<br />it's brilliant."
1712461 1713963 - Stop yelling.<br />- Stop it!
1714797 1716382 Little known fact:
1716549 1721220 The woman who plays<br />Mary Jane's mother is...
1721387 1725099 ...my co-producer<br />Ian Bryce's wife.
1725266 1728436 She is also an actress<br />in her own right.
1728603 1734317 She loved wearing those leopard... She<br />got the sleaziest outfits. I loved it.
1735610 1739780 This scene was shot at 6 a.m.,<br />the night before I turned 19.
1739947 1743826 - On Kirsten's birthday.<br />- It was on my birthday.
1744035 1747121 We shot in the morning,<br />which was your birthday.
1747288 1751250 - And we celebrated.<br />- I got a cake. But it tasted like...
1751417 1754086 It was cool.<br />It was like a breakfast cake.
1754253 1758466 Like strawberry jam and bagel.<br />I don't know. It was good.
1758633 1761177 - We were fighting the sun.<br />- Yes.
1761427 1764972 And birds. Listen closely,<br />you can hear the birds.
1765181 1767850 - Just on Tobey, though.<br />- The sunrise birds.
1768059 1771312 I got to sync mine. You can<br />see my long underwear in this shot.
1771520 1774148 And you were wearing<br />your own coat.
1774315 1777526 We were gonna shoot the scene<br />without the coat...
1777693 1782949 ...but it was freezing. And that was<br />your coat that we all loved.
1786202 1792208 I think this scene was shot on<br />Kirsten's 18th birthday. Is that right?
1792375 1795378 - I think so.<br />- I remember there was a big cake.
1795586 1799215 At the end of the night.<br />Our last night in New York.
1799382 1801509 Very cold.
1802301 1807848 It's true. The whole crew had hoods on,<br />and scarves, gloves and hats, and...
1808015 1809350 ...act...
1810518 1812019 ...on stage.
1812603 1813646 Really?
1813896 1819151 She does a beautiful job here opening<br />up a little window of her soul to Peter.
1821153 1825408 Maybe the first time M.J.'s ever<br />really done that to somebody.
1826117 1828327 Peter, that was first grade.
1828828 1830329 Well...
1830871 1832373 ...even SO.
1833374 1835251 Sometimes...
1836127 1837753 ...you know people.
1838254 1840589 I remember with a lot of the scenes...
1840756 1842216 In this case...
1842383 1847013 ...Tobey and I had to keep cutting<br />down the dialogue, cutting it down...
1847221 1852059 ...to just find the minimum<br />that we could say.
1852226 1855354 Although David Koepp did a great job<br />writing it.
1855521 1860359 And then Alvin Sargent did<br />a beautiful job polishing it.
1860568 1863362 When we got there, we just realized...
1863529 1867408 ...less had to be said<br />to make it work.
1868951 1873456 That garage back there became<br />your guys' office between takes.
1873622 1876292 The next-door garage,<br />the door would come up...
1876459 1880296 ...and you guys would work out<br />of the office. Or out of the garage.
1881797 1882965 I hunch.
1883132 1886302 We were racing against the sun<br />this night, I remember.
1886469 1890973 Mostly because of that last-minute<br />edit session...
1891140 1894101 - ...before the performance.<br />- Yeah.
1896187 1899607 - Okay, Grant, what kind of car is that?<br />- It's a Dodge Viper.
1899815 1903736 Is it really? Not a Viper. I thought<br />it was a lower-end version.
1903903 1907281 No, it's not a Viper. It's a Dodge...<br />Great.
1907990 1909909 Yeah, thank you.
1911660 1914455 What is that thing?
1915998 1919794 It's pretty. Our transportation<br />coordinator, Randy Peters...
1919960 1924840 ...let me drive it home one night<br />when we had one in Los Angeles.
1931847 1934350 I think it's a Dodge Prowler.
1934934 1937853 - Is that it?<br />- I think you're right.
1941524 1947988 It's a brilliant idea of Stan Lee's<br />originally to have Peter...
1948155 1952368 ...enter a wrestling match where<br />those colorful costumes are a must...
1952535 1954870 ...to develop the Spider-Man costume.
1955037 1959625 That was a smart way to have him<br />originally come up with an outfit.
1959792 1966382 This was one of the Marvel artists who<br />we got to do some of the sketches...
1966549 1971053 ...so that the design of the costume<br />would look like...
1971262 1975724 ...the comic book's<br />for the comic book aficionados.
1976350 1980896 Jeff Lynch shot a lot of the drawing<br />of the costume for me.
1981063 1986819 And that artist did a lot of the actual<br />illustration, like you suggested.
1987570 1991365 Remember, Kirsten, we had this scene<br />of you dancing in the window.
1991532 1993200 That was too provocative.
1993367 1997246 Initially this took place<br />over a number of days.
1997413 1999415 So at one point in the scene...
1999582 2003252 ...Peter looks out his window<br />and Mary Jane's dancing.
2003419 2005921 I was first dancing in my underwear.
2006088 2009091 - Then in a leopard thong. Not really.<br />- We covered you up.
2009300 2012595 Then I wore pajama pants<br />because it was a little too much.
2012803 2017141 - Now I see the spider webs, kind of.<br />- See the spider webs?
2018309 2021103 - I love this, when he's lying.<br />- This is hilarious.
2021270 2024565 "Okay, thanks." Like such a little boy.<br />So cute.
2024732 2026233 - Tobey ad-libbed.<br />- Cute.
2026400 2029111 That came out of the scene with her.
2029278 2033699 - I love that. I love the webs.<br />- Yeah. That looks cool.
2035201 2037369 Meanwhile...
2053135 2056472 Something's bothering him. Maybe<br />he's too embarrassed to tell me.
2056639 2059350 Maybe I'm too embarrassed<br />to ask him.
2060142 2062144 I just don't know anymore.
2062603 2065147 I'm going to the library.<br />See you later.
2065356 2068734 - Wait, Pete. I'll drive you there, buddy.<br />- I'll take the train.
2068901 2070653 No, I need the exercise.<br />Go on. Go, go.
2070861 2074990 He needs the exercise.<br />That's a funny line.
2078327 2080621 There's the car, Sam.
2083165 2087127 It's an 88 Oldsmobile Delta.<br />1973?
2087294 2091173 It's a, yeah, 1973 Delta 88 Oldsmobile.
2091423 2093676 Kids, it's currently for sale.
2093884 2097805 If you'd like to own a piece of<br />the Spider-Man movie, just contact me.
2097972 2100307 There's a little problem<br />with the radiator.
2100474 2103352 But otherwise I would recommend it<br />to compliment...
2103519 2108023 ...any connoisseur's<br />motion-picture-prop movie collection.
2108190 2110943 No collection is complete without it.
2111402 2114363 No, you're not supposed<br />to run away, but...
2114530 2119118 Pete, you're changing. I went through<br />exactly the same thing at your age.
2119326 2121328 No, not exactly.
2121662 2125374 Peter, these are the years<br />when a man changes...
2125541 2129545 ...into the man he's gonna become<br />the rest of his life.
2129712 2132840 Just be careful who you change into.
2134383 2138887 This guy Flash Thompson,<br />he probably deserved what happened.
2139346 2141390 Cliff made this scene work...
2141557 2145477 ...beautifully. It's one of my favorite<br />scenes in the picture.
2145644 2150733 Remember, with great power<br />comes great responsibility.
2151358 2156363 Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?<br />Quit worrying about me, okay?
2156530 2158741 Something's different.<br />I'll figure it out.
2158907 2165331 I kept Cliff up till like 2 in morning the<br />previous night, recutting this scene.
2165497 2168083 Trying to make the dialogue play,<br />rewriting it.
2168250 2171253 He was exhausted<br />because it was a 6 a.m. call.
2171462 2174340 So he had three and a half hours<br />of sleep.
2174506 2177551 Yeah, he did a great job that night.
2177718 2183515 I love that Danny played the theme here<br />too. It's such an interesting impulse.
2184224 2188896 He had two themes going,<br />Peter's theme and Spider-Man's theme.
2189063 2194276 And they would each derive from<br />the other. But I love that he played...
2194443 2196904 ...that right there.
2206413 2207873 This was pretty funny.
2208040 2214755 That's Bone Saw. That's Randy Savage,<br />and he's, obviously, a wrestler.
2215297 2220260 And when he came to audition for us,<br />I just fell in love with his voice.
2220427 2223555 Like, amazing, that voice.
2227267 2232064 Remember when Randy Savage<br />met with you for the first time on this?
2232231 2234608 I can't remember our first meeting.
2234817 2237027 You were asking him<br />what type of moves...
2237194 2239321 ...he thought<br />would be good on-screen.
2239488 2243200 I'll never forget, he grabbed<br />Ian Bryce, our producer...
2243367 2247079 ...his head, shoved them between his<br />legs, demonstrated a pile driver on Ian.
2247246 2249415 I thought he was gonna kill Ian.
2249581 2254795 Ian's face was turning red,<br />and Randy just kept working him over.
2255045 2256672 I felt so sorry for Ian.
2256839 2259299 There's my buddy, Bruce Campbell.
2259508 2262594 I love the fact that he would<br />do this for me. Be in this picture.
2262761 2265305 I only wish I could've punished him<br />in some way.
2265472 2268767 The audience enjoys Bruce's<br />performances in films relative to...
2268934 2273981 ...the amount of punishment<br />he endures in the picture.
2274148 2277443 - Remember that young lady's name?<br />- Octavia Spencer.
2277609 2279862 The check-in lady.<br />Is that who you're asking?
2280028 2284783 - Yeah, she did a great job.<br />- She was Francine Maisler's assistant.
2284950 2288871 Sometimes. She comes in and<br />helps. She did a really good job for us.
2289079 2291832 We had footage of those women<br />beating up that wrestler.
2291999 2295461 Kicking him in the face and stomach<br />once he was down.
2295669 2299298 But we just didn't have time<br />to incorporate everything in the picture.
2299465 2304636 I love Bruce's Cadillac medallion<br />that they put on him.
2304803 2308056 James Acheson gave him. Yes.
2310559 2315230 If he can withstand just three minutes<br />in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...
2315522 2319902 ...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...
2320736 2323739 - What's your name, kid?<br />- The Human Spider.
2324364 2326658 That's it? That's the best you got?
2326825 2329411 Bruce is so great.
2331663 2335250 You probably won't admit to it,<br />but if you look closely...
2335417 2340547 ...I think I remember who pushed<br />Spider-Man onto the platform that day.
2340839 2343425 - I think that's Sam Raimi.<br />- Just the hand.
2343634 2345761 I love shoving Spider-Man around.
2345928 2348764 - No, he got my name wrong.<br />- Get out there, you moron.
2349223 2353018 That was our PA, Rhys, who shoved<br />him out, but that was your hand.
2353185 2356688 I think I remember who was throwing<br />the popcorn at Tobey here as well.
2356855 2358732 - How dare you?<br />- Yeah, well...
2360067 2361902 You're not as nice<br />as everybody says.
2362069 2364112 Somebody's gotta tell<br />the truth someday.
2364279 2368242 - It was a pleasure working with you.<br />- Yeah. Thank you, sir.
2368951 2370619 Oh, my legs.
2370786 2373413 Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.
2373789 2378043 That's something...<br />That line came from a real story.
2378210 2382256 Rob Taperd once was driving from<br />Detroit, and he had just...
2382422 2384758 My partner, good friend...
2384925 2388053 ...and he was going past<br />an automobile accident...
2388220 2392099 ...and they were pulling some guy out,<br />and that was what he was screaming:
2392266 2395310 "My legs! Oh, God,<br />I can't feel my legs."
2395477 2397980 - As horrible as it was...<br />- How twisted.
2398188 2400816 That's why it's in the picture.
2400983 2405404 Really wanted to give Peter Parker<br />a taste of what was to come.
2405571 2408490 This is some kind of mistake.<br />I didn't sign up for a cage match!
2409700 2412327 Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!
2412494 2417165 Mark Andrews, our storyboard artist,<br />contributed an incredible amount...
2417332 2422087 ...to this whole fight scene. A lot<br />of the ideas in this scene are his...
2422337 2427467 ...and it's guided by his brilliance<br />and his great storyboarding.
2428635 2431471 - Remember Mark?<br />- Oh, yeah. Great guy. He's an animal.
2431638 2436602 He could just crank those out.<br />He had such great ideas too.
2438270 2442482 A lot of these fighting moves were<br />developed by Jeff Habberstad...
2442983 2448155 ...and others by Chris, our stuntman.
2448322 2452117 Chris Daniels did a lot of great work.<br />Great spidey-pose reference.
2452284 2456038 He did a lot of homework.<br />He really knows his Spider-Man poses.
2456246 2459291 Some of the ideas came<br />from watching those wrestling videos.
2459499 2463045 Like beating him up with the chair.
2463253 2465380 Randy had a lot of input on all this.
2465547 2468675 Wasn't this one of the first sequences<br />we filmed...
2468884 2471011 ...with the wrestling arena?
2471219 2473889 Yes, it was. I remember they had a big<br />press conference...
2474139 2476808 - ...and it took place in this arena.<br />- Yeah.
2477017 2478894 Right, Ian scheduled it early.
2479061 2483982 We had to film it to make way for the<br />balcony sequence in Times Square.
2484191 2487986 It was filmed on the same stage.<br />We had to film here and get out.
2488153 2492157 All of those guys in the crowd did<br />an incredible job, all the extras.
2492324 2496495 They put so much energy<br />into the screaming and the jumping.
2496662 2499581 I could tell they loved Spider-Man.<br />That's why they were there.
2499790 2501833 We got a better performances...
2502000 2505671 ...than usual<br />because they're such fans of the comic.
2505837 2510884 Cash Oshman was the extras casting<br />director and he did a good job...
2511051 2512928 ...of giving us a lot of great people.
2513095 2516098 A hundred bucks?<br />The ad said $3000.
2516306 2520394 I like Neil's set in this room<br />and the hallway, and the sound job.
2520560 2527025 They work to tell the story that this is<br />some subterranean area of the arena.
2527693 2530112 Which is a hard thing to communicate.
2530278 2532989 The promoter is played<br />by Larry Joshua...
2533156 2535742 ...one of my favorite character actors.
2537452 2543291 This is such a pivotal scene, and so<br />much right out of the comic book...
2543458 2548213 ...and something we felt<br />we had to really do in a way...
2548422 2550632 - ...that fans would recognize it.<br />- Right.
2552134 2557264 It's obviously the scene<br />upon which the whole story turns.
2557431 2559057 He's got my money!
2559266 2560892 Thanks.
2561893 2564646 What the hell's the matter with you?<br />You let him go!
2565647 2569151 Look at the rake to this ceiling.<br />That's what I was referring to...
2569317 2572154 ...when I mentioned Neil designed this<br />to seem like...
2572320 2575073 ...it was underneath the stadium.
2575240 2577242 I love Tobey's face here.
2577409 2580328 He's a sinner.<br />He's let pride and anger rule.
2580495 2583832 You won't see that look<br />anywhere else in the picture.
2583999 2590088 He's full of himself, feels his own<br />bitter justice has been served.
2590255 2592507 The guy deserved it.
2595135 2600140 It's a sin he'll end up paying for<br />the rest of his life.
2602809 2605645 - What happened?<br />- Someone got hurt.
2608023 2611193 - Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.<br />- Stay back.
2611693 2613528 - Stay back!<br />- That's my uncle!
2615697 2618325 - What happened?<br />- Carjacker. He's been shot.
2618492 2622037 We just called the paramedics.<br />They're on their way.
2622204 2623622 Uncle Ben?
2624164 2626833 Cliff Robertson was a real sport<br />in shooting this.
2627000 2630128 It's probably 3:00 in the morning,<br />it was freezing cold...
2630295 2633006 ...and we'd say,<br />"Get Cliff on the ground."
2633173 2636676 He'd just throw himself right<br />down on the cold concrete.
2636885 2639721 No screaming for a furni-pad<br />or any of that nonsense.
2639888 2645352 He'd throw himself down and<br />wait for the camera crew to set up.
2645519 2647938 He's a real professional.
2655862 2661243 It was written originally<br />that Cliff was already expired...
2661409 2663829 ...when Tobey's character<br />came up to him.
2663995 2667916 It was his idea. He said,<br />"Why don't we just have me alive...
2668083 2672546 ...to make contact with Peter<br />one last time?" It's a great idea.
2675674 2680595 That alley he just ran in was the same<br />alley that he climbed up the wall in.
2680762 2684474 We shot one in the day<br />and this at night, obviously.
2685267 2687269 Downtown Los Angeles.
2689187 2691690 - I love this.<br />- I have a funny story about this.
2691857 2697863 We did a test of CG Spidey<br />climbing up the wall...
2698029 2703451 ...which was a very early iteration<br />of this scene right here.
2704035 2707789 I took the test, I called Amy Pascal<br />and John Calley and I said:
2707956 2712294 "We put Tobey in the suit and we<br />tested him climbing up.
2712502 2715630 We put a wall on its side<br />and tested him climbing up the wall."
2715797 2719467 We were in pre-production. I was<br />trying to get more money for the movie.
2719634 2723597 I called them into the screening room<br />and they came down and watched it.
2723763 2727809 It was CG, but I said it was Tobey<br />in the suit. They went nuts.
2727976 2731146 They said, "Oh, my God, it's amazing!<br />He looks so incredible"
2731646 2733732 Then we laughed.
2734649 2739279 This was a composite of Tobey's real<br />face put into the CGI Spider-Man.
2739446 2741531 That was a very tricky move.
2756463 2760967 I enjoy watching him struggling with<br />swinging. He's never done it before.
2761134 2764471 I love the subtlety that you<br />and John Dykstra put together in here...
2764638 2767182 ...of him twisting and turning<br />on one of these shots...
2767349 2771061 ...showing him struggling<br />with his gift and curse.
2771853 2774940 Arthur Coburn, was insistent,<br />one of my editors...
2775148 2780946 ...that we had to track his progression,<br />as far as his development of grace.
2781112 2785533 He had to be as awkward as possible<br />in this early sequence to sell it.
2785700 2788370 - And I thought that was a great idea.<br />- Yeah, it was.
2797003 2799506 I shot this sequence<br />with our second unit...
2799673 2802092 ...director of photography,<br />Chris Faloona.
2805345 2809599 He did a lot of great second unit work<br />for us. Chris is a garner.
2809808 2812143 So happy to be going with him.
2829995 2833164 This is a beautiful set built by Neil.
2836418 2841673 It's supposed to be the interior<br />of the abandoned part...
2841840 2844426 ...of the New York<br />Port Authority Building.
2844676 2848263 Where the old ferry<br />used to arrive every day.
2852267 2853601 Who's there?
2879878 2882964 Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.<br />Give me a chance!
2883173 2887635 What about my uncle?<br />Did you give him a chance? Did you?
2887802 2889304 Answer me!
2892682 2893975 <i>Stop that guy!</i>
2897312 2900106 - Great moment.<br />- It's very powerful.
2900482 2903985 Again, this moment<br />is so much a trigger...
2904194 2910450 ...and so integral to what made<br />the whole story work in the comic book.
2910617 2916081 There's this whole notion that<br />Spider-Man doesn't ever kill anybody.
2916247 2921169 But he has to be responsible for this<br />guy's death, so the guy actually trips.
2921336 2927217 But the whole, sort of,<br />ethic of Spider-Man is...
2927425 2931846 - ...he defends people, but he doesn't...<br />- Kill them.
2932597 2937310 Even, of course, with the Goblin,<br />who's responsible for his own death.
2938937 2942315 He just has a lot of good luck<br />in that way.
2953118 2955495 This was an image that we loved.
2955662 2959124 Which was also an early image<br />Sam had...
2959290 2962877 ...of Peter on one of the eagles<br />in the Chrysler Building.
2963044 2967382 If you know New York, you'll know that<br />skyline is something that we made up...
2967549 2970218 ...which was something we did often<br />in the movie.
2970385 2976391 We took architecture that we liked and<br />manipulated it in the CG world.
2976558 2982063 So you know it's New York,<br />but no street is exactly photo-real.
2982897 2987235 That's why I...<br />New York has never been shot this way.
2987402 2990363 It's so inventive and beautiful<br />and romantic, in a way...
2990530 2993074 ...when he swings through the city.
2996411 2999414 - Good evening.<br />- General. Good to see you.
3000206 3003084 Our exoskeleton's got<br />real firepower, general.
3003251 3008673 Well, if it does what you say it can,<br />I'll sign that contract tomorrow.
3009382 3012927 - He's clear, let's go!<br />- You're confident about this test?
3013094 3015388 Absolutely.<br />Captain Curtis is our top pilot.
3016097 3018892 Now, what about<br />your commitment to OSCORP?
3019767 3020977 This entire sequence...
3021144 3024939 ...starting with that "Quest Aerospace"<br />stenciled on the crate...
3025106 3030737 ...all the way through the explosions of<br />the bunkers was shot by John Dykstra...
3030904 3032697 ...my second unit director.
3032864 3035700 <i>We are picking up<br />an unidentified object, closing fast.</i>
3036117 3039829 - Your favorite transition is coming.<br />- Yeah.
3047921 3050798 - That's really fun.<br />- It's so cool. I love it.
3050965 3052050 "Chess!"
3052217 3054469 Sam just makes this such a great...
3054636 3059474 We have some action, then you come to<br />the more humanistic things.
3059641 3063144 It's just so great how he balances<br />all of that out.
3063353 3065480 The audience is never scared...
3065647 3069734 ...because right after comes<br />a happy thing or sweet thing.
3069901 3073488 It's just a great mixture of action<br />to the story line.
3074072 3075490 It just blends very nicely.
3075657 3078159 Peter, the science award.<br />That's terrific.
3078576 3079869 Yeah.
3081162 3083081 I don't know if I should tell this.
3083248 3088169 This scene was shot on the Sony lot<br />in front of the executive building...
3088336 3091839 ...because we only had half a day<br />to shoot the scene...
3092006 3094759 ...so we didn't have time<br />to go to a location.
3094926 3099389 So we dressed up the front<br />of the building...
3099597 3103101 ...and wouldn't let the executives<br />get into their office on that morning.
3103268 3106980 I love it. Now when I walk<br />on the Sony lot, it's like:
3107146 3110775 "That was our school in Spider-Man."<br />It'll always be there.
3110984 3116030 It makes for a great tour spot<br />on the Sony tour.
3116197 3117448 That's true.
3128126 3130378 Can I fix you something?
3130545 3131963 No, thanks.
3132130 3134048 - I love Rosemary.<br />- She's amazing.
3134215 3135883 Yeah, she's amazing.
3136050 3140138 She's so beautiful, I think.<br />She's magnificent-looking.
3141180 3144892 She's funny, because she really didn't<br />know anything about Spider-Man.
3145059 3147186 She worked with Sam on The <i>Gift.</i>
3147395 3151065 I knew her through mutual friends<br />but had never worked with her.
3151232 3155236 She had no idea<br />what she was getting into.
3155445 3158990 Now she goes places and<br />she's recognized as Aunt May.
3159157 3162702 - She has a whole new following.<br />- That's so funny. Fan following, yeah.
3163077 3165747 - This is a great scene.<br />- Yeah.
3168416 3172253 I remember right before<br />the camera rolled, I told Tobey:
3172420 3176257 "Your name is not gonna be<br />above the title."
3176758 3179010 I missed him a lot today.
3181596 3183097 I know.
3184849 3186684 I miss him too.
3188436 3190772 But he was there.
3193941 3199113 I can't help thinking about<br />the last thing I said to him.
3199447 3204369 He tried to tell me something important,<br />and I threw it in his face.
3206120 3208206 You loved him...
3209874 3212126 ...and he loved you.
3213002 3216631 He never doubted<br />the man you'd grow into.
3216798 3220301 How you were meant for great things.
3220802 3223137 You won't disappoint him.
3250081 3252291 I love Danny's score right here.
3253668 3256295 It really takes you into the moment.
3256671 3260842 <i>With great power<br />comes great responsibility.</i>
3261050 3264262 <i>Remember that, Pete. Remember that.</i>
3271811 3275982 That shot was shot with an Earl Wiggins<br />cam in Downtown L.A...
3276149 3278359 ...with a New York background.
3279527 3280862 Great shot.
3284699 3288369 Doug Lefter shot this scene for me,<br />the whole robbery.
3288953 3294041 These snippets were shot by<br />Dick Buckley, second unit director.
3294500 3297044 I love that dog.
3297211 3299839 We called her "the dog walker."
3306554 3309557 These guys I actually found<br />on a construction site.
3309724 3313853 We were shooting the scene in front<br />of the library with Uncle Ben...
3314020 3318191 ...and we were trying to get<br />real faces, great faces.
3318357 3322195 I found these guys<br />in this construction site.
3323029 3326908 They couldn't believe it. "What do you<br />mean? We're gonna be in a movie?"
3327074 3331496 It's always better to get real people.
3331871 3333748 Guy with eight hands.
3333915 3336918 Lucy Lawless, a friend of Sam's.
3338211 3340087 - This guy I love.<br />- Yeah, he was funny.
3340254 3342882 Doesn't he look like Owen Wilson?
3343049 3344884 - Kind of?<br />- A little bit.
3346385 3350056 - He doesn't have Owen's great nose.<br />- No.
3353100 3356270 "Who is Spider-Man?"<br />He's a criminal, that's who he is.
3356437 3359607 - I love him. He's so good.<br />- He's fantastic.
3359774 3364195 J.K. had worked with Sam in The Gift...
3364362 3367907 ...and he came to see us in New York<br />and it was like meeting you.
3368074 3372078 It was like, "This guy has to play<br />this part." Born to play the part.
3372245 3375122 Once we got the hair...<br />It's the thing about hair.
3375289 3378292 Once we got the hair, he was Jameson.
3378793 3381712 And Sam's brother's in this scene also.
3382880 3387969 Like the Delta 88 and Bruce Campbell,<br />Ted Raimi is in all Sam Raimi movies.
3388135 3389804 He's hilarious.
3391931 3395101 - There's Sam's brother.<br />- There's Ted.
3396686 3399814 - We sold out four printings.<br />- Sold out?
3399981 3401232 Every COPY-
3401816 3404318 Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one,<br />with a decent picture.
3404485 3406153 - Conway to page 7.<br />- That's a problem.
3406320 3408656 Page eight, give him 10 percent off.<br />Five percent.
3408823 3410491 - That can't be done.<br />- Get out!
3410825 3414453 - He's so good.<br />- Sam loves to work with him.
3414620 3418666 It's such a big brother-little brother<br />relationship. He likes to torture him.
3418833 3424505 He makes him do 12 takes.<br />He's really kind of sadistic.
3425798 3429260 He doesn't want to be famous?<br />I'll make him infamous!
3432847 3437518 There's a famous New York extra,<br />radio man, that goes sneaking by there.
3437727 3441939 - Do you remember him?<br />- Sure do. Radio man. He's a classic.
3443232 3446360 He was in For Love of the <i>Game</i><br />but he found the cutting room floor.
3446527 3449614 But he did a great job for us<br />in that one too.
3449864 3451866 Begging for a job. How about you?
3452992 3456954 Every time I see these two together,<br />they make a connection for me.
3457121 3461792 She gives a bit of herself in everything<br />she does. She's very generous.
3461959 3463502 I just got off a job.
3463669 3467256 She's great at playing layers<br />and levels of things.
3467465 3469842 She's so embarrassed.<br />Doesn't want Peter to know.
3470009 3472553 I see she's not a very good liar<br />in this scene.
3473721 3475681 Excuse me, Miss Watson?
3475848 3477558 Busted.
3477725 3480019 Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.
3480186 3482146 It better not happen no more.
3482313 3485483 Pete even feels worse than she does<br />about the whole thing.
3486067 3487568 He's very empathetic.
3488152 3491530 - There's the button.<br />- "Try my cream pie."
3493866 3496494 It's nothing to be<br />embarrassed about.
3497203 3501582 - Makes me want to go to New York.<br />- Yeah. That was a beautiful day too.
3501791 3504377 We're going out. Didn't he tell you?
3504877 3506420 Oh, yeah. Right.
3506754 3509090 I think he'd hate the idea...
3509298 3510841 There's paparazzi guys too.
3511008 3514387 Tobey pisses off the paparazzi guys.<br />They're nicer to me.
3514595 3518683 - Do they go away when you tell them?<br />- They're just, like, nicer to me.
3519225 3523729 The more you act like,<br />"Don't take my picture," the more...
3523896 3527024 - Just wave and they go away.<br />- Give them a moment.
3527191 3531696 But Tobey likes messing with them<br />a little bit more.
3532029 3535241 They were in his eye line.<br />They stayed out of mine...
3535408 3540371 ...but throughout his eye line they were<br />always taking his pictures and stuff.
3540538 3544959 I'll come by and have some of your<br />Moondance coffee someday.
3545126 3547795 - And I won't tell Harry.<br />- No, don't tell Harry.
3547962 3549255 I won't.
3551424 3553134 I won't tell Harry.
3559098 3562977 I love that location,<br />it's right across from NYU.
3563144 3566313 It was an amazing apartment,<br />where the exterior was shot.
3566480 3571110 - This was a set that Neil designed.<br />- Yeah, this is an amazing apartment.
3571277 3574488 Where do you get this apartment<br />in New York? I'd love to live here.
3574655 3576824 Daddy got it for him. Daddy.
3578492 3580828 They even have a nice balcony.
3582663 3585166 I remember when we worked<br />on this set...
3585374 3589837 ...Tobey had a lot of good notes<br />for myself and Neil Spisak...
3590004 3595301 ...about the reality of the size of the<br />loft that these two would really have.
3595468 3598012 And the style of the furnishings.
3598262 3603392 He had a more realistic take and guided<br />us from a character point of view...
3603601 3606020 ...which is so important<br />in making a picture...
3606187 3611108 ...to listen to actors and believe they<br />have the best take on who they are...
3611275 3615446 ...and what they know about<br />their world, to listen to that.
3618908 3623204 See I love this intrigue,<br />this set up of the triangle.
3623412 3625456 Sam had said, even early on...
3625623 3631003 <i>"mat he wanted 'Ms 90210 or Melrose<br />Place... I don't watch those shows.</i>
3631170 3632338 Very soap Opera-Y-
3632546 3637009 He wanted these, kind of,<br />teenage relationships...
3638511 3643390 ...to be moving in a parallel line<br />with the superhero story.
3643641 3647686 - I believe it. I see that kind of behavior.<br />- There's tension.
3647853 3650397 Yeah. Seems really real to me.
3650564 3652024 Hello.
3653567 3655861 Let's go! Move it!
3657029 3658697 Watch the street!
3662409 3665538 That was me in the suit<br />during this fight scene.
3665746 3668791 - That was you? You're very acrobatic.<br />- You know...
3669166 3671669 You're multi-talented.<br />I saw Bring <i>It</i> On.
3671877 3673921 I know you can do those jumps.
3674088 3675506 Cheese!
3677258 3680553 Neil Spisak and his team came up<br />with these pictures.
3680719 3683514 They're very difficult because<br />Spider-Man can't be doing any...
3683681 3686600 ...of the things in reality<br />that are needed in these pictures.
3686767 3688894 We can't do it with an actor.
3689103 3692773 So we had to stage backgrounds<br />and separate foreground elements...
3692982 3697611 ...and do a lot of composites<br />and then clean up in a digital state.
3697778 3702449 It was a big deal to come up with<br />those pictures Peter supposedly took.
3702616 3705202 Give you 300.<br />That's the standard freelance fee.
3706745 3710124 There's a slight old-fashioned quality<br />to the whole film.
3710291 3713586 It feels like a '50s comic book,<br />even with what we wear.
3713752 3716797 I told Jim I really wanted to wear<br />a trench coat in the film...
3716964 3722803 ...because it signified for me that classic<br />"girl-in-the-comic-book" kind of look.
3723470 3726765 I'm pleased about that, that what<br />we captured looks like a comic book.
3726974 3731020 Yeah, and it has an old-school<br />feel to it, the movie, a little bit.
3732313 3736317 I was so happy that Elizabeth Banks<br />took the job of Betty Brant...
3736483 3738819 ...in the reception area here.
3739570 3741614 With a talented actress like that...
3741780 3744325 ...I was able to have these actors<br />make a moment...
3744491 3747411 ...when there was really<br />nothing there.
3748329 3751749 Bill Nunn did a great job<br />as Robbie Robertson, as well.
3751916 3753292 I'm Peter Parker.
3755794 3757963 I'm a photographer.
3758756 3761300 Yes. I can see that.
3765012 3767056 He strikes out everywhere.
3767514 3771518 Yeah, he strikes out, but at<br />the same time, I see on his face...
3771685 3776482 ...that as lame as he is, he's actually<br />achieved one of his dreams.
3776649 3779652 - So he feels a sense of fulfillment.<br />- Yeah.
3779860 3782696 In short, ladies and gentlemen<br />of the board...
3782863 3786033 ...costs are down, revenues are up...
3786867 3789286 Neil designed this set<br />on the Warner Bros. lot.
3789453 3794500 It's one of his best accomplishments,<br />it's really beautifully detailed.
3794667 3796460 He created depressions...
3796627 3801131 ...in the walls where<br />he'd hide these fluorescent tubes.
3801340 3805469 Quite beautiful, giving it a lot of<br />dimensionality.
3805636 3809723 They don't want a power struggle<br />with entrenched management.
3810015 3812309 The deal is off if you come with it.
3812476 3815896 The board expects your resignation<br />in 30 days.
3816105 3818065 You can't do this to me.
3821235 3823529 I started this company.
3824571 3826991 You know how much I sacrificed?!
3830828 3836250 - Oh, Max. Please.<br />- Norman, the board is unanimous.
3836834 3840838 We're announcing the sale<br />after the World Unity Festival.
3841005 3842506 I'm sorry.
3843507 3845634 You're out, Norman.
3853434 3856228 There's the Goblin theme.
3861108 3864278 <i>Welcome to OSCORP Industries<br />Unity Day Festival.</i>
3865863 3867781 What a complicated shot that is there.
3867948 3871535 You've got Downey,<br />you've got New York background plates.
3871702 3875247 You've got pieces shot<br />on the stages here at Sony.
3875539 3880669 Very complex. It took us a long time<br />to design that shot.
3880961 3884590 And a lot of these shots here<br />in the Times Square sequence.
3884965 3890220 Neil did a great job with Don Burgess<br />and John Dykstra and his team...
3890387 3895642 ...just seamlessly tying<br />a lot of locations together.
3895809 3900314 Don Burgess had a difficult job in<br />shooting all these different elements...
3900481 3903275 - ...to fit together, lighting-wise.<br />- Yeah.
3904985 3907696 That is obviously a stage shot here...
3907905 3912910 ...but the last shot of Parker<br />was shot on the streets of Downey.
3913077 3918332 He had a lot of New York photography<br />and it all had to blend seamlessly.
3921502 3924338 Remember this drama<br />of trying to find the dress?
3924505 3927174 - I love that dress.<br />- Yeah, it's good.
3927341 3931345 It makes sense too, because<br />it's not an expensive dress, you know.
3931512 3932596 Great choice.
3932846 3936100 M.J., would you do me a favor?<br />I forgot my drink inside.
3939686 3942147 I also like that line where he says:
3942314 3946527 "Why didn't you wear the black dress?<br />My father loves black."
3946735 3948445 It is a funny line.
3949530 3954701 - Have you seen my father around?<br />- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.
3954868 3960040 This was, without question, the most<br />complicated thing we did in the movie.
3960207 3962543 Even more complicated than the end.
3962751 3964336 We would have these meetings.
3964503 3968048 We would have these weekly<br />or bi-weekly, or sometimes daily...
3968215 3970217 ...what we called<br />"Times Square meetings."
3970384 3972886 Starting from when we made<br />the decision...
3973053 3975305 ...to set this scene in Times Square.
3975514 3979810 The logistics of how to do it<br />and how to get the shots.
3980018 3984982 The building where you guys are on<br />the balcony is a building Neil made up.
3985149 3989736 It doesn't really exist in Times Square,<br />but we had to fit it in geographically.
3989903 3994908 And there were plates that were shot<br />for this stuff up in the sky.
3995075 3999037 And then there was a gigantic set<br />built in Downey.
3999204 4005002 So even though<br />it's a five-minute sequence...
4005210 4009673 ...in terms of the resources<br />and the shooting time...
4009882 4015804 ...we probably shot, between the set<br />and the location, three weeks maybe.
4016013 4018432 - Close to a month.<br />- It was a big deal.
4020434 4022728 There was Stan Lee.<br />There's Stan Lee.
4023437 4028400 - Laura's daughter is coming in soon.<br />- My daughter. The stuntman who fell...
4028609 4031737 ...was a guy who played Spider-Man<br />on the TV show.
4032529 4034948 Remember that?<br />Here we go, Kirsten.
4035115 4038452 Here starts the screaming match.<br />Hold your ears.
4038619 4040037 "Oh, God!"
4040204 4043790 I kept telling Sam...<br />I love that shot.
4044833 4048462 Girls in movies who scream<br />really annoy me.
4048629 4051924 At the end, I got a little annoyed<br />by my screaming.
4052132 4054259 At the end of the movie.
4058305 4061808 I love that.<br />That's one of my favorite things.
4062643 4067981 The pumpkin bomb was kind of fun<br />because the Goblin was full of...
4068148 4070567 - There's my daughter.<br />- Yeah. Hi, Julie.
4072653 4074947 The Goblin has this bag of tricks...
4075155 4077491 ...and when we were sitting<br />and thinking about it:
4077658 4082412 "What would a pumpkin bomb look like?<br />Who would think of such a thing?"
4083580 4087501 This kid's stupid. I know he's<br />in shock, but move, already!
4087668 4090879 Wouldn't your mother go in<br />and move you?
4091088 4094466 - She couldn't get to him.<br />- Oh, yeah, whatever.
4095008 4097010 - Hold it!<br />- I surrender.
4097177 4100180 Willem demanded to do<br />all his own fighting.
4100931 4105102 He felt that the character<br />had to be consistent...
4105310 4109481 ...and that it would show if he<br />let stuntmen do his work.
4109648 4111483 It wouldn't sell.
4112526 4116863 Not that the quality would be poor,<br />but it wouldn't be the same character...
4117030 4119908 ...that he'd created and seen through<br />from beginning to end.
4121118 4123912 In this strafing run,<br />this is him on the glider right there.
4124121 4127332 That's right, that behind shot.<br />Shot by Max Kleven.
4127499 4132212 It's really a good... Well-designed<br />glider gag that Max came up with...
4132796 4136717 ...hanging off of the camera car,<br />on a Ubangi on wires.
4136925 4138885 It worked beautifully.
4143849 4149021 The storyboard artists, mostly Doug<br />Lefter, did a great job designing all this.
4149229 4153066 He had help from Neil Spisak<br />and the production department...
4153317 4155652 ...with balloons and the set.
4155861 4157904 Also,<br />Jeff Lynch and Dave Stephan...
4158071 4160699 ...contributed a tremendous amount<br />to this.
4161908 4165412 But my hat's off to Doug.<br />He's such a great visualist.
4168874 4170709 This sequence is complicated.
4170917 4176256 Andrew Jimenez really added a lot<br />with his skills...
4176465 4178342 ...working this whole sequence out.
4178508 4182095 Karen Goulekas contributed quite a bit<br />on the picture.
4182346 4187517 John Dykstra and the animation team<br />made each and every shot come to life.
4187684 4191772 But it couldn't have been put together<br />unless we had Bob Murawski...
4191938 4196777 ...who worked the pieces as the editor<br />and made them all come together.
4197235 4200155 That was a great swinging shot<br />by our stuntman.
4200322 4205118 Jeff Habberstad put together this shot<br />over the blue sky over the ocean...
4205285 4208288 ...because there're no<br />green screens that big.
4208497 4212542 They shot that out at the ocean.<br />It's a beautiful swing.
4215754 4221718 Neil Spisak really came up with a<br />beautifully romantic location here...
4221927 4224638 ...for the moment between<br />Peter and Mary Jane.
4224805 4228517 He did his homework. Many<br />New Yorkers don't know this exists...
4229101 4232270 ...on top of the Rockefeller Center<br />roof garden.
4232646 4236775 It is such a beautiful place up there,<br />with the church in the background.
4247035 4249454 Starting to swing a little better.
4251456 4257671 I love when he swings off and yells.<br />It's like the high of public service.
4257838 4262426 You've done your best to help others<br />and that's what he's celebrating.
4262592 4264344 That's really why it's so effective.
4264511 4267347 And he runs along that building.<br />I love that moment.
4267514 4270851 The fellas in the animation department<br />came up with that.
4271059 4274688 I think it was Anthony,<br />our animation director.
4274855 4277190 And what do you mean,<br />incredible?
4280026 4282362 All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.
4282571 4284322 Don't let the bedbugs...
4285991 4288660 Alvin Sargent wrote that scene.<br />It's one of my favorites.
4288869 4292956 So funny, with James Franco<br />on the phone with M.J.
4293165 4297127 You just imagine, obviously,<br />the other side of the conversation.
4298211 4300964 And then, after being dumped on...
4301131 4306011 ...he hangs up the phone and he says,<br />"She's just a little rattled."
4306386 4309055 What else would he be thinking?
4309222 4310724 I didn't.
4314603 4317022 I'm gonna get some rest.
4318231 4320525 I'm gonna stay up for a while.
4321610 4323361 What was that thing?
4323904 4325238 I don't know.
4326698 4330076 Whatever it is,<br />somebody has to stop it.
4330744 4332996 That moment was important to me...
4333163 4339252 ...because it was Peter Parker stepping<br />up to the responsibility of Spider-Man.
4345926 4347636 Somebody there?
4347886 4349930 <i>Somebody.</i>
4351264 4352766 Who said that?
4353183 4357062 This sequence with Willem takes you<br />to depths of the insanity...
4357270 4362359 ...that his character is starting<br />to plummet down into.
4364528 4366821 I love the device you came up with...
4366988 4371034 ...with the mirror showing<br />his two different personalities...
4371201 4373787 ...and interacting with his<br />two different personalities.
4373954 4376540 You know, that was in the script.
4377040 4379960 It was all made to work...
4380126 4384256 ...just only through Willem Dafoe's<br />performance.
4384965 4388176 Did you think it was coincidence?
4388426 4391972 So many good things,<br />all happening for you.
4392138 4395809 All for you. Norman.
4398311 4399771 What do you want?
4400313 4402315 To say what you won't.
4402649 4405151 To do what you can't.
4405318 4409948 To remove those in your way.
4413910 4415829 The board members.
4417163 4418498 You killed them.
4418707 4420250 We killed them.
4420584 4421626 We?
4421835 4425088 Remember?<br />Your little accident...
4425255 4427924 It's this lesson you learn<br />all the time...
4428091 4432596 ...about how much you need<br />to communicate, for the story...
4432762 4437934 ...what's going on, and how much<br />an actor brings to the storytelling.
4438101 4442355 Initially written, it was a three<br />and a half page scene, or something.
4442522 4447027 And the revelation as we went along<br />in the process was...
4447235 4450864 ...you could get everything you had<br />to get from a storytelling standpoint...
4451364 4456036 ...as well as the emotional stuff<br />that was going on with the character...
4456244 4458455 ...much more economically.
4459873 4463043 Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.
4463335 4466546 The Green Goblin. You like that?<br />Made it up myself.
4466755 4469716 - These weirdos all got to have a name.<br />- Mr. Jameson, Spider...
4469883 4471551 - Hoffman!<br />- Yeah?
4472802 4476556 Copyright the name "Green Goblin."<br />I want a quarter every time it's said.
4476765 4479059 How about "Green Meanie"?
4479225 4482062 Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.<br />That's slander.
4482270 4484564 It is not. I resent that.
4484856 4487567 Slander is spoken.<br />In print, it's libel.
4487776 4489402 You don't trust anybody.
4489903 4491655 I trust my barber.
4492322 4493990 What are you, his lawyer? Get out.
4494199 4498912 Let him sue. Get rich like a normal<br />person. That's what made this country...
4504084 4508088 I remember shooting that scene with<br />the cigar flying back into the window.
4508254 4514511 Usually it missed the table, sometimes<br />it landed in J.K.'s lap, burning him.
4514678 4518431 It's a dangerous scene, to have<br />that hot thing flying in from behind.
4518598 4520600 One of my favorites to shoot.
4520767 4522102 You are useless.
4522268 4526231 Jane Alexander did such a great job<br />with his hair.
4526398 4530026 It's so J. Jonah Jameson. He's great.
4530443 4532570 ...let Mom and Dad<br />talk for a minute.
4532779 4535240 Sleep...
4549713 4553717 Wake up, little spider. Wake up.
4553883 4558304 No, you're not dead yet.
4558471 4560640 Just paralyzed...
4560849 4562809 ...temporarily.
4563810 4566896 You're an amazing creature,<br />Spider-Man.
4567105 4569774 You and I are not so different.
4570483 4573820 I'm not like you. You're a murderer.
4573987 4576906 Well, to each his own.
4577073 4579993 I chose my path,<br />you chose the way of the hero.
4580660 4585331 And they found you amusing<br />for a while, the people of this city.
4585498 4588793 But the one thing they love<br />more than a hero...
4589002 4592589 ...is to see a hero fail,<br />fall, die trying.
4592756 4597302 In spite of everything you've done for<br />them, eventually, they will hate you.
4597510 4598511 Why bother?
4598762 4603475 - Because it's right.<br />- Here's the real truth.
4603892 4606895 There are eight million people<br />in this city.
4607187 4611649 This whole notion of trying to see,<br />at least see the eyes...
4611816 4616529 ...even though we couldn't see<br />any of Tobey's features...
4616696 4620825 The genius of what Sam did<br />in the end of the movie was find a way...
4621034 4626206 ...to reveal Tobey's face<br />in the final scenes.
4626414 4629375 Because as you can see,<br />looking at this...
4629542 4635048 ...you're limited in how you can act<br />behind those masks.
4635715 4637717 Or we could destroy.
4637926 4641888 Cause the deaths of countless<br />innocents in selfish battle...
4642055 4646976 ...again and again and again until<br />we're both dead. Is that what you want?
4647185 4651898 Great animation from the fellas at SPI.<br />I love him leaping on that glider.
4652065 4656236 He seems like he's gotta balance<br />himself for a brief moment.
4656486 4661074 He gotta grab a hold of the front of<br />the glider to stabilize himself.
4661241 4663243 - Seems very real to me.<br />- Yeah.
4663827 4669165 <i>In spite of everything you've done for<br />them, eventually, they will hate you.</i>
4676589 4680260 This was also shot<br />on the Warner Bros. back lot.
4681177 4682387 How was your audition?
4682554 4685098 The sound man gave me<br />an ugly choice. He said:
4685265 4689853 "You can have oars in the background,<br />or you can have your sound."
4690061 4691938 Horrible thing to say.
4693690 4698611 They made so much noise going over<br />those wet city streets, those cabs.
4699070 4702115 Motion picture cabs are always<br />in terrible shape.
4702282 4706286 Loud engines, terribly in need<br />of a tune up.
4707787 4713543 This is my favorite scene between<br />the two of them. I really, really enjoy it.
4715461 4716880 I'd like a cheeseburger.
4717046 4720049 Alvin Sargent wrote this.<br />Did a beautiful job with it too.
4720216 4721968 He did a great job.
4722135 4723595 Come with us.
4723761 4726514 No, thanks. How's it going with...?
4728433 4730935 Never mind.<br />That's none of my business.
4731436 4732937 It's not?
4734314 4736024 Why so interested?
4736316 4739402 Avi Arad had a great idea during<br />this scene.
4739569 4743656 He said, "Maybe this is the point<br />where she can finally say 'Tiger."'
4743948 4750455 Which is what all the fans know is one<br />of Mary Jane's favorite taglines.
4750622 4752123 I don't know.
4752332 4756753 So Kirsten then said, "Why don't I say it<br />just as I leave, at the very end?"
4757003 4762050 So together, they satisfied that one<br />of one thousand fan requirements.
4762300 4764928 It's a great little punctuation mark.
4770350 4772352 Hey, check it out, man.
4772518 4774187 Come on, man.
4774479 4778107 This scene was further torturing<br />of Kirsten...
4778316 4782695 ...in very, very cold weather<br />and freezing cold water.
4783446 4785198 This wasn't a fun scene.
4785490 4787825 Although I did like<br />to do my little butt-kicking.
4787992 4789202 You did.
4790995 4794374 See, the sidewalks are higher<br />on the back lot...
4794666 4797794 ...so the water floods in the street.
4798044 4801130 You're up to water on your ankle.
4803299 4806678 This was tough because we were<br />all bundled up in front of heaters...
4807095 4811683 - ...and you were out there for hours.<br />- Freezing my booty off.
4813351 4816396 And trying to be romantic<br />at the same time.
4818231 4822902 When we were doing the close-up<br />dialogue without the looping...
4823152 4826489 ...I was screaming at him.<br />I was like, "You're amazing!"
4826739 4831494 Because we couldn't hear each other<br />because the rain was so loud.
4834205 4837583 There was a secret door built<br />into the side of that wall...
4837834 4842422 ...so that Tobey could escape into it and<br />the stuntman could then come down.
4842714 4844674 Although, this is Tobey here.
4845008 4850263 But the first time you saw Spider-Man<br />descend was the stuntman.
4850847 4852223 Does she know or doesn't she?
4852390 4854851 You have that moment<br />where maybe you know it's him?
4855059 4856561 Here? No. That's at the end.
4856769 4860106 But when he says,<br />"I was in the neighborhood."
4860356 4863401 No? That's what I always think<br />because he said to you earlier on:
4863568 4864902 "I was in the neighborhood."
4865153 4869115 No, I don't think M.J.'s that bright.<br />Or Kirsten.
4869282 4873453 No, no, I just...<br />I wouldn't give anything away there.
4873745 4876956 There was this wonderful image<br />in the comic book of him...
4877165 4881127 ...with his, you know,<br />mask half off like that.
4881294 4885465 It was something that Sam had<br />in his head very early on...
4885715 4889677 ...to have this upside-down kiss<br />which is so...
4889927 4896392 I know it was painful, but it really<br />is his signature moment of the movie.
4896601 4901773 Our mixers, Greg Russell and Kevin<br />O'Connell did a great job mixing this.
4901981 4905443 This scene, they handled<br />just beautifully, like the old movies.
4905693 4909989 They let the rain all drop away,<br />brought up Danny Elf man's score.
4910239 4913618 They let the audience soar<br />with the emotion of the thing...
4913785 4916829 ...pushing away the reality<br />of the moment.
4935515 4937850 Let me in! My baby's in there!
4938017 4941604 This was a great piece<br />of location work in New York.
4941813 4944607 I was very impressed<br />that they let us...
4944816 4949112 ...blaze that building<br />as large as we needed to.
4949320 4952532 We owe a great debt<br />to the city of New York for that.
4952865 4955618 John Fedynich, he was our New York<br />location manager.
4955868 4961332 He did a lot of great work securing<br />the permits and permission to do that.
4961541 4966045 When he swings into that window,<br />the one piece of animation I love...
4966337 4970675 ...is when the animator lets his web<br />get caught in the updraft of the heat.
4970883 4976639 And it just floats upward in a moment,<br />right before the cut.
4976848 4981352 It really captured<br />the lightness of the web.
4987233 4991237 - It's okay. Your baby's fine.<br />- Oh, my baby!
4992280 4994699 God bless you, Spider-Man.
4994907 4998077 The blanket has no dirt<br />on it or anything.
4998369 5000580 Now, come on, you guys.
5000788 5004083 Oh, my God, there's somebody<br />still up there!
5005334 5007503 I'm going.
5008588 5011591 - I'll be here when you get back.<br />- Not coming back, chief.
5012049 5013176 Go! GO!
5019265 5024187 This scene that John Frazier and his<br />team of fire experts put together...
5024395 5028191 ...I was really impressed by.<br />The amount of fire.
5028441 5031736 The fact that they pulled it off<br />so safely was incredible.
5032445 5033863 I'm gonna get you out of here!
5034030 5036908 Initially, we thought the suits<br />were flammable.
5037116 5042371 We did all of this experimenting<br />with fire retardant. Scary.
5042580 5044457 That's so scary, that...
5045750 5049212 The action in this sequence<br />is amazing, I think.
5049378 5050963 Like a moth to the flame.
5051881 5054342 What about my generous proposal?
5055384 5058221 Are you in or are you out?
5058429 5060973 It's you who's out, Gobby.<br />Out of your mind.
5061474 5065269 That's such a cheese line,<br />but really cute.
5065603 5069440 "It's you who's out, Gobby.<br />Out of your mind."
5070066 5075363 That's one of my favorite piece of<br />animation. The fluidity of movement.
5075613 5078824 They really captured the awkwardness<br />of the human form...
5078991 5080910 ...and its grace at the same time.
5081244 5083871 I was always impressed by it.
5084413 5087959 I love the weapons, though.<br />This was another challenge.
5088125 5091504 We'd had this notion about<br />what Sam called "razorbats."
5091671 5098803 You know, the pumpkin bomb turns into<br />these flying boomerang-knife things.
5099011 5101347 Scary.
5102098 5104767 Great sound design in here as well.
5106310 5109272 Steve Flick did a great job in putting<br />these sounds together...
5109438 5112191 ...with his team of effects cutters.
5115027 5118489 - M.J., will you stop goofing around?<br />- Harry, relax.
5120992 5122201 He's here.
5123035 5125454 - Are you ready?<br />- Yeah.
5126372 5129041 Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.
5129208 5132336 Work was murder.<br />I picked up a fruitcake.
5132545 5135965 Thank you, Mr. Osborn.<br />We're so glad you could come.
5136215 5138884 Who is this lovely young lady?
5139051 5143389 I'd like you to meet my father.<br />Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.
5143556 5146225 I've been looking forward<br />to meeting you.
5146475 5150187 - Happy Thanksgiving, sir.<br />- Now, where is Peter?
5150354 5152732 He'd better have remembered<br />that cranberry sauce.
5158487 5162074 Oh, that's weird.<br />I didn't know he was here.
5165077 5166579 Peter?
5171250 5172835 Peter?
5174754 5178924 The Spider-Man mask wasn't made<br />to come off so easily.
5179091 5182178 James Acheson had to design one<br />just for that shot...
5182345 5184680 ...that could be pulled off in an instant.
5184930 5187433 He knew it would never hold up<br />to scrutiny...
5187600 5191604 ...so he made certain exactly what the<br />shot would be and designed it for that.
5192438 5196901 - Bit of a slob, isn't he?<br />- All brilliant men are.
5198778 5201614 - We actually put Tobey up there.<br />- You did?
5201906 5203741 You bet.
5210206 5214210 One of my favorite shots coming up<br />here. He looks up. He's not there.
5214460 5220549 We come back down, he's already<br />a step ahead of us, furious about it.
5229517 5232144 - Hey, everyone.<br />- Oh, Peter!
5232311 5234063 Sorry I'm late,<br />it's a jungle out there.
5234230 5238150 Had to beat an old lady with a stick<br />to get these cranberries.
5238609 5241445 Thank you.<br />Now then, everybody sit down...
5241612 5243155 ...and we can say grace.
5244740 5246325 Parker.
5247952 5251288 I remember the turkey in this scene<br />had been sitting around for two days.
5251497 5255251 Put off this terrible,<br />rotting, horrible odor.
5255459 5259964 People had to pretend that it<br />was a delicious-looking thing.
5260172 5262133 In fact, it was nauseating.
5262341 5266554 Created an awful stench<br />that turned your stomach.
5275563 5278816 Why, Peter, you're bleeding.
5281652 5286991 I stepped off a curb and got clipped<br />by one of those bike messengers.
5287158 5288701 Well, let me see.
5288868 5290369 Oh, my goodness.
5290661 5293038 - That looks awful.<br />- No, it's nothing.
5293205 5296375 I'll get the first-aid kit.<br />Then we'll say grace.
5296584 5301881 This is the boys' first Thanksgiving<br />here, and we'll do things properly.
5302840 5305885 How did you say that happened?
5306343 5308053 Bike messenger.
5308220 5310222 Knocked me down.
5315603 5319231 - If you'll excuse me, I've got to go.<br />- Why?
5320191 5323569 Something has come to my attention.
5323736 5327406 - Are you all right?<br />- I'm fine, just fine.
5327656 5330201 This sequence is<br />such good moviemaking.
5330409 5333704 It's so entertaining,<br />such good, concise storytelling.
5333913 5337708 It's such a pivotal moment<br />in the movie...
5338834 5344006 ...where everything comes together<br />and all the conflicts are...
5344256 5348010 All the rest of the movie<br />is set in motion.
5350054 5352806 Your mother was beautiful too.<br />They're all beautiful.
5352973 5357061 Until they're snarling after your trust<br />fund like a pack of ravening wolves.
5357269 5358521 You're wrong about her, Dad.
5359063 5362274 A word to the not-so-wise<br />about your little girlfriend:
5362441 5366278 Do what you need to with her,<br />then broom her fast.
5373702 5378457 In that moment with Mary Jane Watson,<br />I love where Kirsten is hurt...
5378707 5382378 ...then she pulls it together<br />and you see some anger come out.
5382586 5386465 And then she decides she's not<br />gonna take it and she stands up.
5386632 5389051 Shut up about stuff<br />you don't understand!
5389218 5394682 I love watching her go through<br />those moments. That thought process.
5396976 5400312 <i>Spider-Man is all but invincible.</i>
5400479 5403649 <i>But Parker, we can destroy him.</i>
5403816 5405150 I can't.
5405317 5408320 <i>Betrayal must not be countenanced.</i>
5408612 5410823 <i>Parker must be educated.</i>
5412992 5414326 What do I do?
5414493 5418622 <i>Instruct him in the matters<br />of loss and pain.</i>
5418789 5421834 <i>Make him suffer.<br />Make him wish he were dead.</i>
5422084 5423335 Yes?
5423502 5425462 <i>And then grant his wish.</i>
5426338 5427673 But how?
5427840 5432177 <i>The cunning warrior attacks<br />neither body nor mind.</i>
5432344 5433512 Tell me how!
5433721 5435848 <i>The heart, Osborn.</i>
5436140 5439184 <i>First, we attack his heart.</i>
5441020 5444523 Give us this day our daily bread,<br />and forgive us our trespasses...
5444773 5447735 ...as we forgive those<br />who trespass against us.
5447985 5451822 Lead us not into temptation,<br />but deliver us...
5453866 5456368 Rosemary was a real sport<br />to go through this...
5456535 5460664 ...tremendous physical challenge,<br />being thrown about that room.
5460873 5465544 With the fans hitting her hard and all<br />the debris flying about around her.
5465836 5468547 I thought the CGI artist<br />did a great job...
5468797 5471884 ...taking John Frazier's<br />explosion on set...
5472134 5477014 ...composting it with her, then creating<br />CG debris elements that flew past her...
5477264 5480351 ...that really put her<br />in an explosion sandwich...
5480559 5483062 ...and sold the fact<br />that she was there.
5483228 5484396 You have to leave.
5484563 5486273 - What happened?<br />- Those eyes!
5486482 5489068 Those horrible yellow eyes!
5489360 5494406 The thing about the eyes, that scene<br />was the first day we had the suit...
5494698 5497660 ...and we didn't have eyes<br />for the mask.
5497910 5499912 We'd never seen them.
5500162 5503874 We were shooting the scene, and we<br />were literally running back and forth...
5504083 5508837 ...to the truck figuring out<br />how opaque should they be, how yellow.
5509046 5512091 And those eyes,<br />when we first did them...
5512341 5516762 ...to get them to look right on camera,<br />you couldn't see through them.
5517179 5519682 This was originally three shots.
5519890 5522851 Don Burgess,<br />when we were shooting it...
5523060 5526313 ...had the idea to put it all together<br />as one, which was a good idea.
5526480 5532194 It was Parker, the hands, the picture,<br />another angle of Parker, and his aunt.
5532403 5536949 Maybe it was five or six shots.<br />He put it all together with one move.
5537199 5539451 It turned out to be<br />the best thing for it...
5539743 5545124 ...because it had a grace in it<br />that cutting would have broken up.
5547126 5549628 - Will she be okay?<br />- She'll be fine.
5549795 5552464 She's been sleeping all day.
5553465 5556218 - Thanks for coming.<br />- Of course.
5560389 5563308 How are you?<br />You okay about the other night?
5563475 5567146 Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad<br />about leaving Aunt May.
5567396 5570357 - Have you talked to Harry?<br />- He called me.
5570816 5572985 I haven't called him back.
5575070 5576780 The fact is...
5577948 5580743 - ...I'm in love with somebody else.<br />- You are?
5580951 5584747 Alvin Sargent did such a beautiful job<br />writing this speech by Peter.
5584955 5589585 It's so heartfelt<br />and it really gives you a glimpse...
5589793 5593797 ...into the depths of his soul<br />and his feelings for her.
5594506 5595924 Trust me.
5596175 5597426 It's funny.
5599428 5603348 He's saved my life twice,<br />and I've never even seen his face.
5603515 5606935 - Oh. Him.<br />- You're laughing at me.
5607144 5610105 No, I understand.<br />He is extremely cool.
5610314 5613525 But do you think it's true, all the<br />terrible things they say about him?
5613692 5617696 No, no. Not Spider-Man,<br />not a chance in the world.
5617905 5619531 I know him a little bit.
5619698 5622618 I'm sort of his unofficial<br />photographer.
5622826 5625954 - Has he mentioned me?<br />- Yeah.
5626288 5627706 What'd he say?
5628332 5629666 I said...
5630709 5635047 He asked me what I thought about you.
5635547 5638175 One of my girlfriends<br />who saw this scene said:
5638383 5645140 "This is the speech every girl wants<br />a boy to make to her."
5645390 5652064 This is one of the many moments when<br />what we saw in that room in Berlin...
5652356 5655984 ...is what happened in this scene<br />that made it worked so great.
5656235 5659988 - Yeah, Tobey was easy to work off of.<br />- Yeah.
5660697 5665327 Everything feels not quite normal.
5665577 5671500 Both Arthur Coburn and Bob Murawski<br />did a great job with this picture.
5671750 5674878 One of Bob's talents,<br />which you see in this scene...
5675087 5679258 ...is his sense of performance<br />and take selections.
5679550 5682177 He really has a great talent<br />to be able...
5682427 5685889 ...to be able to go in and watch all<br />the performances again and again...
5686056 5690269 ...and choose what I think<br />is the best of the best.
5690561 5694606 That really plays in the moment...
5694857 5697776 ...and cut them against each other.
5699862 5701989 It's as if you've...
5702197 5705075 ...reached the unreachable.
5705284 5709246 His style of dress<br />is another thing entirely.
5713292 5715043 You said that?
5715794 5718130 Well, something like that.
5739818 5742446 That was Harry's first day on the set.
5742613 5745574 For some reason<br />he came in with black hair.
5745824 5747284 It was the weirdest thing.
5747534 5752539 We'd already figured out he was gonna<br />match his hair color to Willem Dafoe's.
5752789 5756126 He steps in to shoot,<br />and he's got black hair.
5762174 5764509 It gets a laugh in the theater,<br />this scene.
5764676 5767971 He's like, "Dad? Is that you?"<br />It's the most ridiculous...
5768180 5772976 But the laugh altogether<br />is such a signature of the character.
5774603 5777272 That's one of my funniest moments<br />in the picture.
5777522 5781860 He comes in and hears the rantings<br />and ravings of his father.
5782110 5783862 It's based on, for me...
5784112 5788617 I would come home and hear my mother<br />upstairs saying things...
5788825 5794623 ...that she should have said to others,<br />but didn't have the guts. "Mom?"
5797209 5799795 He's loved her since the 4th grade.
5800712 5806009 He pretends like he doesn't, but<br />there's no one Peter cares for more.
5808887 5810681 I'm so sorry.
5813141 5816603 I haven't always been there for you,<br />Havel?
5818230 5820107 You're busy.
5820357 5822359 This was filmed in a great location<br />in L.A.
5822609 5826363 It was a huge mansion up<br />in the Hollywood Hills.
5826613 5831076 That's right. And Neil Spisak demanded<br />that we not shoot here.
5831326 5835622 He'd learned that they had shot<br />a scene from Batman here.
5835831 5840127 He demanded that I not photograph it<br />any way similar to Batman.
5840377 5843422 He made sure to decorate it<br />a very different way.
5843672 5846049 But I don't think anyone knows that.
5846258 5850846 At least they didn't until this moment,<br />when you happened to tell the viewers.
5851054 5854850 Bob came up with the idea<br />of putting that scare in at that moment.
5855100 5858645 - Actually, it may have been Paul's idea.<br />- Paul Hart, assistant editor.
5858895 5861690 Paul's idea to put a good scare,<br />jolt moment in there.
5861940 5864860 He did it as a joke.<br />Like many things...
5865110 5869781 ...I realize some of the assistant's jokes<br />were better than my editor's great ideas.
5870032 5872784 So we took that...
5873035 5876955 ...and Bob transformed it<br />into a full-fledged scare.
5879041 5881293 You were supposed to be asleep.
5882169 5886923 You know, you were about 6 years old<br />when M.J.'s family moved in next door.
5887132 5891136 And when she got out of the car,<br />and you saw her for the first time...
5891720 5893930 This was a great scene<br />that David Koepp wrote.
5894097 5897559 Reminds us of Peter's warmth<br />for Mary Jane ever since he was a child.
5897809 5900729 Helps set up the ending of the piece.
5900979 5903273 When he finally walks away from her.
5903440 5906443 You're reminded<br />just how much she means to him.
5906693 5910739 - She's still his girl.<br />- Well, isn't that up to her?
5910947 5915494 - She doesn't really know who I am.<br />- Because you won't let her.
5915744 5918830 You're so mysterious all the time.
5919122 5921833 Tell me, would it be so dangerous...
5922084 5926004 ...to let Mary Jane know<br />how much you care?
5926505 5928924 Everybody else knows.
5931843 5933136 I'll be right back.
5933845 5935138 But...
5942479 5944481 Come on, pick up.
5944648 5947943 <i>- Hey, M.J.<br />- Hi. Sing your song at the beep.</i>
5948985 5951029 M.J., it's Peter. You there?
5951321 5954157 Hello? You there?
5954658 5959162 I'm just calling to check up on you.<br />Will you call me when you get in?
5959329 5960747 All right, well...
5961164 5962207 Don't...
5962999 5965210 Don't go up any dark alleys.
5965377 5966378 Hello?
5966545 5968463 That laugh.
5970507 5972843 Such a great cackle.
5973051 5975554 Where is she?
5980392 5984771 We actually played around with a lot<br />of different locations for this ending.
5985021 5987566 We knew we wanted to be up high.
5987816 5993822 That seemed like a requirement of the<br />storytelling. The Goblin who flies...
5994072 5998160 ...and Spider-Man who swings,<br />and all that.
5998410 6003081 Then it hit us that<br />the 59th Street Bridge was the place.
6003290 6007502 Little did we know how difficult<br />it would be to execute.
6007752 6010213 Like the Times Square sequence...
6010422 6015177 ...we couldn't actually go up there<br />and shoot on top of that bridge.
6016595 6020807 When we screened the movie<br />for the studio for the first time...
6021016 6026271 ...they watched a sequence of M.J. on<br />the bridge, but there was no bridge.
6026521 6028607 And Spider-Man rescued her...
6028773 6032027 ...but for half of the sequence,<br />there was no Spider-Man.
6032235 6036406 And we were trying to say:<br />"No, no, trust us. It's gonna be okay."
6048919 6050629 Goblin, what have you done?
6055425 6060055 I read about 400 kids<br />for those 10 kids in the tram.
6060305 6064601 I know you did. You were<br />in the casting room with them forever.
6064809 6066937 I spent about four days...
6067145 6070315 ...with 9-year-olds screaming<br />at me and crying for me.
6070482 6073401 It was painful.<br />But they all did a great job...
6073652 6078782 ...and it's really tough. They go<br />through a lot of emotions there.
6092671 6094256 Spider-Man!
6094506 6099010 For all the amount of hanging and<br />dropping I did, it doesn't look painful.
6099261 6102180 - It doesn't? It looks like that to me.<br />- Really? I did a lot?
6102514 6106309 But I was up there<br />for two weeks straight doing stuff.
6106518 6109312 Yeah, you were hanging and falling,<br />hanging and falling.
6109521 6112607 When you auditioned, Sam said:
6112774 6115318 "Are you in good shape?"<br />You made a muscle.
6115527 6120282 - You don't have a lot of muscle.<br />- I don't have any. I'm like, "Yeah, Sam.
6120490 6123201 Sure, whatever you want."
6124411 6128206 This bridge sequence is one of<br />the hardest scenes that I've ever done.
6128415 6131376 To think about how<br />the real bridge worked...
6131626 6134879 ...and blocking the characters<br />on the real structure...
6135046 6139050 ...verses the set pieces Neil<br />and his team built on stages...
6139301 6142220 ...verses the CGI bridge<br />that had to be made...
6142470 6144139 ...and the cheats that had to be made...
6144306 6146558 ...relative to the real bridge<br />and the set pieces.
6146975 6152564 The under-bridge sets that went with<br />it. There was so much to keep in mind.
6152814 6157569 - It got very difficult, I remember.<br />- More so than Times Square sequence?
6157819 6161072 For me, it was, because I couldn't<br />walk the bridge.
6161323 6166202 These places didn't exist so that you<br />could scout and know personally.
6166453 6170915 A lot of it had to be kept in the mind<br />or just done through photographs.
6171082 6175045 So much dimensionality to it.<br />People moving from point A to point B.
6175211 6177881 I don't just mean left and right<br />or backwards and forward...
6178048 6179257 ...but up and down.
6179424 6181760 Under, over, around the bridge.
6181968 6185055 You have to have a sense of it<br />in your mind to make the scene work.
6185221 6187390 So it was a real brain twister.
6187557 6190560 And always trying to keep in mind<br />where you are geographically...
6190769 6193730 ...compared to Manhattan<br />and Roosevelt Island...
6193897 6195982 ...to keep the continuity correct.
6196191 6198068 That's right.
6201571 6203823 Dan Sweetman,<br />a great storyboard artist...
6203990 6209287 ...came in the second half of editing<br />and helped me re-work this sequence...
6209496 6212916 ...based on original work that<br />Jeff Lynch, storyboard artist, had done.
6213124 6216002 Actually, before that,<br />based on work that I'd done...
6216252 6219798 ...with another storyboard artist,<br />Mark Andrews.
6220090 6223301 Everybody really contributed<br />to this sequence.
6223510 6227013 Along with all the people<br />at Sony Pictures Imageworks.
6227180 6231226 Contributed incredible amount<br />under John Dykstra's supervision.
6236648 6240402 That's some more great animation<br />right there.
6245740 6248326 What's the groaning cow there?
6248576 6251621 That's the sound of strain on the...
6252163 6255458 Slowed down to 72 frames a second...
6255667 6260171 ...the sound of thousands of pounds<br />of torque on this steel cable.
6262424 6265844 Tobey's brothers are in the tram too,<br />one of them was.
6266136 6269347 And John Dykstra,<br />visual effects supervisor...
6269597 6272183 ...his daughter was one<br />of the tram kids.
6272350 6278773 John (Sally's stepson is one of the<br />tram kids. Everybody got in the act.
6279816 6281359 I got something for your ass!
6281526 6283319 You mess with Spidey,<br />you mess with New York!
6283528 6286448 You mess with one of us,<br />you mess with all of us.
6286614 6288867 Took a long time to reset<br />and do those shots.
6289033 6293455 All the prop guys and crew members<br />running around picking up rubber pipes.
6293621 6295373 A rubber chicken<br />was slipped in there.
6295540 6298501 But it took a long time<br />to reload all the New Yorkers...
6298710 6302338 - ...with objects to pelt Willem with.<br />- Yeah.
6302547 6308803 It's tough. You've got 150 extras that<br />you've treated badly for two days...
6309012 6313558 ...then you give them objects to throw<br />at you. It's a dangerous job.
6318354 6321107 This was a set constructed<br />by Neil and his team...
6321316 6324611 ...that we referred to<br />as the "hulking ruin."
6324819 6328615 A lot of beautiful<br />design work done in here.
6333244 6337499 Misery, misery, misery.<br />That's what you've chosen.
6338333 6341586 And this, to a large degree,<br />actually exists.
6341836 6346257 It's an old abandoned<br />smallpox hospital on Roosevelt Island.
6346508 6348676 But Neil did take his cue...
6348927 6352472 ...from the actual hospital<br />that's there. It's interesting.
6356267 6359854 I thought the mixers did<br />a beautiful job in here.
6366736 6368821 Tobey did a great job looping too.
6368988 6371282 He had to come up<br />with 16 different ways to grunt.
6371449 6372575 Yeah, he did.
6379374 6381793 Peter Menzies came up with the web...
6381960 6385380 ...Peter uses to stop the Goblin<br />the last second.
6385588 6390760 He was my second unit director<br />of photography just for this sequence.
6394180 6397809 You've spun your last web, Spider-Man.
6397976 6401312 Had you not been so selfish,<br />your girlfriend's death...
6401479 6403147 ...would have been quick<br />and painless.
6403314 6406776 But now that you've really<br />pissed me off...
6406985 6411906 ...I'm gonna finish her<br />nice and slow.
6416828 6419789 Sam came in one day and said,<br />"I want him to have a trident."
6419998 6422625 I don't know where that came from.
6422834 6425837 - With electric prods on the end.<br />- Right.
6427213 6430842 Get him, Spidey.<br />Your will is stronger than his.
6431843 6433761 Kick his buttocks.
6437682 6443855 Kim Kahana did great stunt here.<br />We let this wall fall down on him.
6447692 6453114 Willem did do almost all of his own<br />stunts, but that one was done by Kim.
6453948 6459662 Sam, I'm curious, is that arm coming out<br />of the rubble a wink to <i>Evil Dead?</i>
6459871 6463875 No, it's just a tribute to those old<br />Universal horror pictures.
6470840 6473384 The monster awakens.
6474802 6477555 The guys at A.D.I.,<br />Amalgamated Dynamics...
6477764 6482060 ...did a great job with Willem's mask<br />right there, letting us beat it up.
6482310 6485021 - They really did.<br />- Yeah.
6489567 6491069 Mr. Osborn.
6491277 6492737 Thank God for you.
6492904 6496699 Great work on Spider-Man's costume<br />in various stages.
6496908 6501829 We had meetings about getting him<br />to the stage where you see him here.
6502080 6507210 And a lot of great work done<br />by Jim Acheson and Lisa Tomczeszyn...
6507418 6511589 ...and his team of artists over there<br />in costume shop.
6511798 6516844 Jim had a mockup of the Spider-Man<br />outfit on a dummy he kept in a truck.
6517095 6519222 He'd follow me around,<br />location to location...
6519430 6523184 ...lifting the truck's tailgate, saying:<br />"How about this, Sam?"
6523434 6527021 He'd take a razorblade to it and slice<br />away more pieces and more pieces.
6527271 6530108 He really worked long<br />and hard on that.
6530400 6534237 - The battle-ravaged Spider-Man look.<br />- Yeah.
6537532 6540910 It was difficult because<br />the whole costume works on tension...
6541119 6544247 ...as Jim painstakingly told me<br />again and again.
6544455 6549460 You could only remove certain pieces<br />and still have it hold together properly.
6550461 6554966 Yeah, for the rain sequence,<br />you had to ruin one of our costumes...
6555216 6560471 ...to make the head removable<br />and peeled up like that, and build...
6561139 6562974 ...a special helmet.
6563141 6567979 This shot of Willem coming up<br />was actually shot later. This one.
6568229 6571482 He was already on another show.<br />He had to wear a wig.
6571733 6575611 He's more like the David Bowie<br />of Green Goblins.
6575987 6577864 Don't tell Harry.
6584996 6588458 The reason we re-did that shot<br />because we wanted him to say:
6588666 6590501 - "Don't tell Harry."<br />- Yeah.
6590752 6595590 Rather than it being an act of kindness<br />that Peter performs not tell Harry...
6595840 6600344 ...we wanted him to fulfill<br />the last wish of Norman Osborn...
6600511 6604515 ...this man who had been<br />the surrogate father to him.
6605933 6610271 So that he'd have an obligation,<br />a friendship...
6610521 6615359 ...to perform these last acts,<br />to keep this dark secret.
6628790 6631834 Remember?<br />This was our first day in New York.
6632043 6635046 It was so cold and so windy.
6635296 6640384 Again, we had one day to shoot<br />this critical end scene in the movie.
6640551 6643805 But it was literally...<br />It must have been like 20 degrees.
6643971 6645932 I know what it's like<br />to lose a father.
6646098 6650019 The fellow playing the priest<br />kept asking me for a line.
6650228 6654148 I said, "I can't give it to you.<br />You're just a background player."
6654357 6658236 He had 10 different ideas of how<br />he could have a speaking part in this.
6658402 6661155 I swear on my father's grave,<br />Spider-Man will pay.
6661322 6665201 I really like James Franco's<br />performance in this scene.
6665409 6667745 I feel he's becoming his father.
6667995 6672333 Finally walking to that car that he was<br />so embarrassed of in the first scene.
6672583 6677088 He's very understated.<br />He's just brilliant in this last part.
6677255 6683094 You can feel the evil brewing<br />inside him, and the hatred.
6686597 6691269 That's a great shot.<br />He's almost walking to his destiny.
6696107 6698442 <i>No matter what I</i> do...
6698609 6701737 <i>...no matter how hard I try...</i>
6702280 6706117 <i>...the ones I love will always<br />be the ones who pay.</i>
6716878 6719213 You must miss him so much.
6720131 6723217 It's been so hard without him.
6726137 6729015 There's something<br />I've been wanting to tell you.
6730808 6732602 When I was up there...
6733311 6736147 ...and I thought I was gonna die...
6737773 6741611 ...there was only one person<br />who I was thinking of.
6742904 6746115 And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.
6747241 6750328 There's many questions<br />when you go to shoot a scene.
6750536 6755333 I remember Tobey and Kirsten,<br />they brought so much to this scene.
6755583 6761339 But one question was, they weren't<br />sure we should do the kiss at the end.
6763007 6767678 I really appreciate them going for it,<br />giving it a shot.
6767970 6771349 Because it turned out...<br />And you never know it at the time...
6771557 6774310 ...but it wouldn't have even worked<br />without it.
6777438 6781859 We developed a great deal of trust<br />throughout the making of the movie.
6782026 6785947 They were willing to try things.<br />They learn to trust you...
6786197 6789200 ...that if it doesn't work,<br />you won't keep it in the picture.
6789367 6792870 Laura was a big advocate of it too.<br />I thank her for that. Our producer.
6793037 6794664 I love you.
6795498 6799502 You had a great collaboration<br />with these two. They're gifted...
6799710 6802630 ...well beyond their years.
6811514 6815393 Tobey did this scene.<br />Tobey screen-tested for the job.
6815643 6819313 He did a version of this scene<br />which was the thing...
6819522 6822108 The studio executives were in tears<br />when they saw it.
6822316 6827863 That's when they said they knew he<br />was the perfect choice for the movie.
6828531 6830074 You can't what?
6831200 6832660 Tell you...
6834370 6838708 ...everything.<br />I mean, there's so much to tell.
6839709 6842253 Yeah. There's so much to tell.
6842420 6845756 Sam, if you were 19,<br />would you walk away?
6846007 6849552 I can't remember<br />what it was like being 19.
6849885 6853848 I will always be there<br />to take care of you.
6854849 6856851 I promise you that.
6860146 6862440 I will always be your friend.
6865359 6867236 Only a friend...
6868112 6869655 ...Peter Parker?
6871782 6874660 That's all I have to give.
6887214 6890301 This scene was a great combination...
6890593 6896474 ...of David Koepp, Alvin Sargent,<br />great input from the producers...
6897475 6899226 ...and, of course, the actors.
6899477 6903314 Laura did a lot of great work<br />on that scene.
6903814 6906734 <i>I will never forget these words...</i>
6906984 6910488 As I watch him at the end here,<br />I really feel he has matured...
6910780 6916494 ...grown into the person<br />that his uncle thought he could be.
6917203 6919121 <i>Who am I?</i>
6919497 6921207 <i>I'm Spider-Man.</i>
6921457 6924752 This is the shot...<br />This shot was actually...
6925002 6928798 ...literally conceived 18 months<br />before we delivered the movie.
6929006 6932009 They started working on the shot<br />and it was the last thing...
6932301 6934011 ...that came into the last shot.
6934178 6937348 It went into the film<br />just as we were finishing the dub.
6937515 6941310 - It's an absolutely amazing shot.<br />- Yeah, it is.
6943521 6947525 This is Sam Raimi, on behalf<br />of the cast and crew and everybody...
6947733 6949944 ...thank you for watching the movie<br />with us.
