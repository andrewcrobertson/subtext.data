186886 190223 Who am I?<br />You sure you wanna know?
190390 193593 The story of my life<br />is not for the faint of heart.
193726 196429 If somebody said<br />it was a happy little tale...
196596 200967 ...if somebody told you I was just your<br />average guy, not a care in the world...
201301 202936 ...somebody lied.
203836 207507 But let me assure you, this,<br />like any story worth telling...
207640 208975 ...is all about a girl.
209876 214447 That girl. The girl next door.<br />Mary Jane Watson.
214581 217650 The woman I've loved<br />since before I even liked girls.
217784 220520 I'd like to tell you that's me<br />next to her.
220653 222655 Aw, heck, I'd even take him.
223990 226593 Hey! Stop the bus!
227594 228728 That's me.
228895 230797 Tell him to stop! Please!
230964 232332 Stop!
232498 234667 Hey! Stop the bus!
234801 237870 Stop! He's been chasing us<br />since Woodhaven Boulevard.
238004 239405 Catch a cab, Parker!
243776 246613 Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.
251951 253386 What a geek!
253920 258291 -Don't even think about it.<br />-You're so lame, Parker.
258424 259892 Would you date him?
277810 279979 Midtown High seniors.
280313 283883 No wandering. Proceed direct--<br />Knock it off.
284317 287687 Remember, it is a privilege<br />to be here.
287987 291391 We're guests of Columbia University's<br />Science Department.
291591 293760 So behave accordingly.
293893 296929 Let's not have a repeat<br />of our trip to the planetarium.
297297 298798 Come on, people, stay together.
298931 301868 Proceed up the steps<br />and into the building.
303002 306039 -Where were you?<br />-Checking out the library.
306372 308808 -Looking at the books.<br />-Yeah, right.
310610 312912 Charles, can we drive<br />around the corner, please?
313046 314480 Why?
314647 316482 The entrance is right there.
316616 320386 Dad, these are public-school kids.<br />I'm not showing up in the Rolls.
320520 322789 What, you want me<br />to trade in my car for a Jetta...
322922 325925 ...because you flunked out<br />of every private school I sent you to?
326059 329062 -It wasn't for me.<br />-Of course it was.
329662 331531 Don't ever be ashamed<br />of who you are.
331664 334067 I'm not ashamed of who I am.
334434 335668 It's just....
335802 337370 Just what, Harry?
337537 338938 Forget it.
341941 343409 Pete!
343743 345478 -Hi, Harry.<br />-Hey, man. What's up?
345611 346913 Harry.
347046 349415 -Won't you be needing this?<br />-Thanks, Dad.
350383 352685 Peter, may I introduce my father,<br />Norman Osborn.
352819 354353 I've heard so much about you.
354487 357890 -Great honor to meet you, sir.<br />-Harry says you're a science whiz.
358091 360960 You know,<br />I'm something of a scientist myself.
361094 364430 I read all your research<br />on nanotechnology. Really brilliant.
364564 367600 -And you understood it?<br />-Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
367767 370970 Impressive.<br />Your parents must be very proud.
371104 372972 I live with my aunt and uncle.<br />They are.
373106 375775 Hey, you two! Let's move!
375908 379645 -Nice to meet you.<br />-Hope to see you again.
381914 385518 -He doesn't seem so bad.<br />-Not if you're a genius.
385651 387620 I think he wants to adopt you.
387754 392525 There are over 32,000 known species<br />of spider in the world.
392692 396529 They're in the order Araneae,<br />divided into three suborders.
396696 397764 That's amazing!
397897 401834 This is the most advanced electron<br />microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.
402101 404137 It's unreal.
404470 407106 Arachnids from all three<br />groups possess...
407473 410676 ...varying strengths to help them<br />search for food.
410910 415414 For example, the Delena spider,<br />family Sparassidae...
415548 419685 ...has the ability to jump<br />to catch its prey.
419819 421621 For the school paper?
426025 431030 Next, we have the net web spider,<br />family Filistatidae...
431197 433099 ...genus Kukulcania.
433499 437770 Spins a funnel-shaped web whose<br />strands have a tensile strength...
437904 443142 ...proportionately equal to the<br />high-tension wires used in bridges.
443709 445445 -Leave him alone.<br />-Or what?
445578 448581 Or his father will fire your father.
448915 451184 What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?
451517 453920 What is going on?
454053 457123 The next person who talks<br />will fail this course. I kid you not.
457490 459492 -This spider...<br />-Let's go.
459625 463763 ...hunts using reflexes with<br />nerve-conduction velocity so fast...
463930 467533 ...that some researchers believe<br />it borders on precognition.
467667 469802 -An early awareness of danger.<br />-Jerks.
469936 471771 A spider-sense.
472472 474006 Hey, look at that spider.
474140 478678 Some spiders change colors<br />to blend into their environment.
478878 480813 It's a defense mechanism.
480947 484183 Peter, what makes you think<br />I would want to know that?
484517 485685 Who wouldn't?
485818 489689 Over five painstaking years,<br />Columbia's genetic research facility....
489822 494126 -You gonna talk to her now?<br />-Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.
494494 496229 Armed with these DNA blueprints...
496562 499098 ...we have now begun<br />what was once thought impossible.
499265 503002 -Disgusting.<br />-Yeah, hateful little things.
503169 504670 I love them!
505104 506839 Yeah, me too.
507807 511711 You know, spiders can change<br />their color...
511844 515715 -...to blend into their environment.<br />-Really?
515848 520019 -Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.<br />-Cool.
520152 523623 --transfer RNA<br />to encode an entirely new genome...
523756 526859 ...combining the genetic<br />information from all three spiders...
526993 531731 ...into these 15 genetically<br />designed super-spiders.
531864 533266 There's 14.
533833 535134 I beg your pardon?
535268 537904 -One's missing.<br />-Yeah.
540840 543543 I guess the researchers<br />are working on that one.
543943 547213 Do you know that this is the largest<br />electron microscope...
547547 548748 ...on the Eastern Seaboard?
548881 552919 You were talking throughout<br />that woman's entire presentation.
553052 554854 Let's go talk about how we listen.
558925 562995 Now, I don't know what it's like<br />at those fancy private schools...
563162 565064 ...but at Midtown High....
573639 577243 Could I take your picture?<br />I need one with a student in it.
577577 579045 -Sure.<br />-Great.
579178 581347 Where do you want me?<br />Over here?
581714 582982 Yeah, that's great.
583316 585051 Don't make me look ugly.
585351 587219 That's impossible.
594627 595828 Perfect.
603636 605071 -Is that good?<br />-Great.
610710 612011 That's great.
617683 619685 M.J., let's go!
621120 623789 Wait. Thanks!
637169 639972 Parker, let's do it.
656756 660126 We solved the horizon glide<br />and the multi-G balance issues.
660259 662895 I've already seen the glider.
663229 665264 That's not what I'm here for.
665431 668167 General Slocum,<br />good to see you again.
669035 671170 Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.
671303 673239 -Norman.<br />-Mr. Osborn.
673372 677009 Always a pleasure to have<br />our board of directors visit.
677176 680713 I want to see the progress report<br />on human performance enhancers.
680846 685251 We tried vapor inhalation with rats.<br />Their strength increased by 800%.
685384 687286 -Excellent.<br />-Any side effects?
687420 688687 In one trial, yes.
688821 691357 An aberration. All the tests since<br />have been successful.
691690 695294 In the trial that went wrong,<br />what were the side effects?
695428 697897 Violence, aggression...
698431 699832 ...and insanity.
699965 702768 -What do you recommend?<br />-That was only one test.
702968 706839 Except for Dr. Stromm,<br />our entire staff certifies the product...
706972 709909 -...ready for human testing.<br />-Dr. Stromm?
711177 714914 We need to take the whole line<br />back to formula.
716115 718451 -Back to formula?<br />-Dr. Osborn.
719785 721454 I'll be frank with you.
721787 726725 I never supported your program. We<br />have my predecessor to thank for that.
726859 729462 The general has approved<br />Quest Aerospace...
729795 732731 ...to build a prototype<br />of their exoskeleton design.
732865 736469 -They test in two weeks.<br />-And if your performance enhancers...
736802 741140 ...have not had a successful<br />human trial by that date...
741340 745845 ...I'm gonna pull your funding.<br />I'm going to give it to them.
747480 749215 Gentlemen. Ladies.
754286 759825 And the Lord said, "Let there be light."<br />And voil√†! There is light.
760025 762094 Forty soft, glowing watts of it.
762228 767099 Good boy. God will be thrilled.<br />Just don't fall on your ass.
767366 769902 I'm already on my ass, May.
770035 774440 When the plant's senior electrician<br />is laid off after 35 years...
774773 777343 ...what else would you call it?<br />I am on my ass.
777510 779979 Hand me that dish. The green one.
780179 782982 The corporation is downsizing<br />the people...
783349 785251 ...and upsizing their profits.
785451 788387 Oh, Ben, you'll get another job<br />somewhere.
789421 792324 Well.... Well, let's look<br />in the paper and see.
793425 796262 There are the want ads.<br />What do we got here?
796395 798097 Computer....
798264 802067 Computer salesman, computer<br />engineer, computer analyst.
802201 806005 My Lord, even the computers<br />need analysts these days.
806238 811477 I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and<br />besides, I have a family to provide for.
811844 814547 I love you. And Peter loves you.
814947 818150 You're the most responsible man<br />I've ever known.
818350 822888 We've been down-and-out before.<br />But somehow, we survive.
823989 828227 Hi, sweetie. You're just--<br />Just in time for dinner.
828394 831030 Hey. How you doing, buddy?<br />How was the field trip?
831163 834033 I don't feel well.<br />I'm gonna go to sleep.
834166 836569 -You won't have a bite?<br />-No, thanks. Had a bite.
836902 839238 Did you get some pictures, Peter?
840105 842975 I gotta crash. Everything's fine.
844310 845978 What's that all about?
867199 869368 In this recombination lab...
869501 874206 ...we use synthesized transfer RNA<br />to encode an entirely new genome...
874373 877409 ...combining the genetic<br />information from all three spiders...
877576 882414 ...into these 15 genetically<br />designed super-spiders.
896996 900966 Dr. Osborn, please. The<br />performance enhancers aren't ready.
901100 904370 The data just doesn't justify<br />this test.
904503 908240 Now, I'm asking you for the last time.<br />We can't do this.
908374 910542 Don't be a coward.
911110 913579 Risks are part of laboratory science.
913946 917516 Let me reschedule, with a proper<br />medical staff and a volunteer.
917683 921253 -Just give me two weeks.<br />-Two weeks? In two weeks...
921387 924990 ...we'll have lost the contract<br />to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.
925124 927927 Sometimes you gotta<br />do things yourself.
928060 930596 -Get me the Promachloraperazine.<br />-For what?
930930 934533 It begins catalyzation when the vapor<br />hits the bloodstream.
937469 939204 Forty thousand years of evolution...
939338 943142 ...and we've barely tapped<br />the vastness of human potential.
957022 958290 Oh, that's cold.
1017049 1018083 Norman?
1022488 1023722 Norman!
1025057 1026358 Norman!
1034500 1035768 Oh, my God.
1037369 1040472 Oh, my God! Norman?
1041206 1043308 Oh, my God! Norman!
1059425 1060793 Back to formula?
1095828 1097429 Weird.
1108373 1109675 -Peter?<br />-Yeah?
1109842 1111643 Are you all right?
1113579 1115280 I'm fine.
1115714 1117616 Any better this morning?<br />Any change?
1117749 1119251 Change?
1120252 1122187 Yep. Big change.
1122321 1126325 -Well, hurry up. You'll be late.<br />-Right.
1144643 1146145 Okay.
1150182 1154553 -Goodness me!<br />-Jeez. I thought you were sick.
1155187 1156455 -I got better.<br />-You see?
1156588 1159892 -Bye, guys.<br />-Have you got your lunch money?
1160225 1163762 Hey, Michelangelo, don't forget,<br />we're painting the kitchen after school.
1163896 1166732 Sure thing, Uncle Ben.<br />Don't start without me.
1166899 1169168 And don't start up with me.
1170402 1174373 Teenagers. Raging hormones.<br />They never change.
1175340 1178911 You're trash!<br />You're always gonna be trash!
1179244 1182714 -I have to go to school.<br />-Who's stopping you?
1200232 1201767 Hi, M.J.
1202668 1204269 Hey, M.J.
1204469 1208907 I don't know if you realize this, but<br />we've been neighbors since I was 6.
1209241 1212511 And I was wondering<br />if we could get together sometime?
1212678 1214313 I got the car. Hop in.
1214446 1216949 Do something fun?<br />Or, I don't know.
1217282 1219885 I thought it'd be time<br />to get to know each other.
1221386 1222588 Or not.
1227960 1230729 Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!
1232231 1234800 -Stop the bus!<br />-Catch a cab!
1235334 1236835 Tell him to stop.
1237569 1239571 -Check him out!<br />-Dork!
1261960 1263362 Dad!
1263729 1265631 Dad, are you all right?
1266498 1267733 Harry.
1271003 1273005 What are you doing on the floor?
1273338 1274606 I don't know.
1275474 1277743 Have you been there all night?
1279745 1280946 Last night I was--
1283415 1284616 What?
1285817 1287619 -I don't remember.<br />-Mr. Osborn?
1287753 1290055 Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.
1290389 1294660 -My father's not feeling well.<br />-Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.
1294793 1295827 What?
1295961 1299631 They found his body in the lab.<br />He's been murdered, sir.
1299765 1303001 -What are you talking about?<br />-And the flight suit and the glider....
1303335 1305404 -What about it?<br />-It's been stolen, sir.
1330362 1332964 Wow! Great reflexes!
1333865 1336001 -Thanks.<br />-No problem.
1337069 1341006 Hey, you have blue eyes.<br />I didn't notice without your glasses.
1341807 1343542 You just get contacts?
1350348 1352484 Well, see you.
1394126 1397729 -What happened?<br />-He's freaking weird.
1398096 1399598 Did you see that?
1401066 1402801 Parker?
1434733 1436968 -It's a fight!<br />-Think you're pretty funny, freak?
1437102 1440138 -Flash, it was an accident.<br />-So is my breaking your teeth.
1440472 1443041 -Come on, Flash, stop.<br />-I don't wanna fight you, Flash.
1443175 1445744 -I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.<br />-Kick his ass.
1465931 1466965 Help him, Harry.
1471937 1473538 How'd he do that?
1474539 1475807 Which one?
1475941 1477242 He's all yours, man.
1492657 1494626 Flash, get up!
1496127 1499231 Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.
1499898 1502667 Peter, that was-- That was amazing.
1503702 1505704 I'm out of here. Come on.
1610875 1611910 Go, web!
1613378 1615080 Fly.
1616748 1618817 Up, up and away, web.
1620218 1621820 Shazam!
1622220 1623688 Go! Go!
1623822 1625690 Go, web, go!
1658790 1660392 Tallyho.
1704335 1707038 -Is she back with the beer yet?<br />-What?
1707172 1708373 Bring me some beer.
1708740 1711176 -Get up off your ass.<br />-I paid for beer--
1711309 1712911 -Stop yelling.<br />-Stop it!
1713044 1715313 You're as stupid as your mother.<br />Get away from me!
1715447 1717115 You are drunk, do you know that?
1717248 1719884 Where's she going?<br />Where you going?
1720952 1724222 These dishes are not done.<br />Somebody's gotta do the dishes.
1724389 1727826 -Why don't you do them?<br />-Get in here and do the dishes.
1727992 1732097 -You do them. They're yours, anyway.<br />-I'm going out!
1732263 1734866 -Were you listening to that?<br />-No.
1735133 1738336 Well, I heard, but I was<br />just taking out the trash.
1738470 1741272 I guess you can always hear us.
1741406 1743842 Everybody shouts.
1744008 1745210 Your aunt and uncle don't.
1746077 1749080 Oh, they can scream<br />pretty good sometimes.
1750482 1754853 Listen, M.J., about today<br />at school with Flash--
1755053 1756755 You really freaked us out.
1756888 1759124 I'm sorry. Is he okay?
1759357 1763328 He's just happy you didn't give him<br />a black eye for graduation.
1766397 1769768 So where are you going<br />after you graduate?
1774372 1776808 I wanna move into the city.
1777542 1782380 And hopefully get a job<br />as a photographer.
1782514 1785383 Work my way through college.
1786384 1787852 What about you?
1787986 1789988 Headed for the city too.
1790555 1792957 Can't wait to get out of here.
1794092 1795493 I wanna....
1796895 1798296 What?
1801166 1803301 No, come on. Try me.
1804302 1805904 I wanna...
1807005 1808273 ...act...
1809407 1811009 ...on-stage.
1811409 1813278 Really?
1813578 1815914 Oh, that's perfect.
1816147 1818583 You were awesome<br />in all the school plays.
1819050 1820919 -Really?<br />-Yeah.
1821452 1824455 I cried like a baby<br />when you played Cinderella.
1825023 1827192 Peter, that was first grade.
1827592 1829194 Well...
1829828 1831229 ...even so.
1832230 1834165 Sometimes...
1835033 1836568 ...you know people.
1837902 1841372 You can just see what's coming.
1844442 1847245 What do you see coming for you?
1849914 1851449 I don't know.
1853918 1858456 Whatever it is, it's something<br />I never felt before.
1862126 1865063 And what for me?
1865196 1866464 For you?
1867999 1870602 You're gonna light up Broadway.
1872203 1873471 You know...
1877976 1880478 ...you're taller than you look.
1880612 1882247 I hunch.
1884449 1886050 Don't.
1889487 1893124 Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride<br />in my new birthday present.
1894192 1895426 Come on.
1896227 1897962 I gotta go.
1898596 1899964 Bye.
1900498 1903234 -Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!<br />-Yeah, right?
1903368 1905370 -Look at it!<br />-Hop in.
1905503 1907906 Oh, my God! What a cool car!
1908106 1909574 Pretty tight, huh?
1910108 1914379 Wait till you hear the sound system.<br />Hey, don't scratch the leather.
1915980 1917382 Cool car.
2010174 2012210 What's going on in there?
2012377 2015079 I'm exercising.<br />I'm not dressed, Aunt May.
2015213 2018750 Well, you're acting<br />so strangely, Peter.
2019183 2021252 Okay. Thanks.
2052116 2055386 Something's bothering him. Maybe<br />he's too embarrassed to tell me.
2055520 2058256 Maybe I'm too embarrassed<br />to ask him.
2059090 2061125 I just don't know anymore.
2061459 2063728 I'm going to the library.<br />I'll see you later.
2064062 2067565 -Wait, Pete. I'll drive you there, buddy.<br />-I'll take the train.
2067698 2071102 No, I need the exercise.<br />Go on. Go, go.
2082146 2085516 -Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.<br />-Wait a minute, we need to talk.
2085650 2090154 -We can talk later.<br />-Well, we can talk now. If you let me.
2090855 2093224 What do we have to talk about?<br />Why now?
2093357 2095259 Because we haven't talked<br />for so long...
2095393 2097395 ...May and I<br />don't know who you are anymore.
2097528 2102567 You shirk your chores. You have all<br />those weird experiments in your room.
2102700 2106804 -You start fights at school--<br />-I didn't start that fight, I told you that.
2107171 2110141 -You sure as hell finished it.<br />-Was I supposed to run away?
2110308 2113311 No, you're not supposed<br />to run away, but....
2113444 2117882 Pete, you're changing. I went through<br />exactly the same thing at your age.
2118249 2119684 No. Not exactly.
2119817 2121119 Peter...
2121552 2124322 ...these are the years<br />when a man changes...
2124455 2128459 ...into the man he's gonna become<br />the rest of his life.
2128593 2130828 Just be careful<br />who you change into.
2133297 2137702 This guy, Flash Thompson,<br />he probably deserved what happened.
2138336 2140905 But just because you can<br />beat him up...
2141472 2143674 ...doesn't give you the right to.
2144408 2149614 Remember, with great power<br />comes great responsibility.
2150281 2155286 Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?<br />Quit worrying about me, okay?
2155419 2158756 Something's different.<br />I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing me.
2159190 2163361 I don't mean to lecture or preach.<br />And I know I'm not your father--
2163494 2166364 Then stop pretending to be!
2170434 2171636 Right.
2174605 2176574 I'll pick you up here at 10.
2207872 2213644 Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
2218482 2222453 -One, two, three. That's it!<br />-Who's the man?
2226557 2228726 Ladies and gentlemen...
2228859 2233497 ...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.
2236567 2240304 For $3000...
2240438 2243941 ...is there no one here man enough<br />to stay in the ring...
2244275 2248846 ...for three minutes<br />with this titan of testosterone?
2251515 2253584 Who?
2253784 2255686 I know who.
2255853 2260691 The Flying Dutchman!
2260958 2262526 Next.
2263394 2266631 There's no featherweight<br />division here, small fry. Next.
2266764 2268633 No, no. Sign me up.
2268966 2272503 Okay. You understand the NYWL<br />is not responsible...
2272670 2276707 ...for any injury you may and probably<br />will sustain in said event?
2276841 2279277 And you're participating<br />under your own free will?
2279410 2280478 Yes.
2280611 2284448 Down the hall to the ramp.<br />May God be with you. Next.
2286917 2289320 Told you! Told you!
2289487 2291322 Winner!
2291489 2292657 Next victim!
2294558 2297461 Are you ready for more?
2298562 2302033 Bone Saw is ready!
2304568 2309307 Will the next victim please<br />enter the arena at this time?
2309473 2314045 If he can withstand just three minutes<br />in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...
2314445 2318749 ...the sum of $3000 will be paid to--
2319650 2322653 -What's your name, kid?<br />-The Human Spider.
2323321 2325623 That's it? That's the best you got?
2325756 2327858 -Yeah.<br />-Oh, that sucks.
2327992 2332596 The sum of $3000 will be paid to...
2332730 2335933 ...the terrifying, the deadly...
2336334 2339503 ...the amazing Spider-Man!
2341806 2344508 -It's "The Human Spider."<br />-I don't care, get out there.
2344642 2347678 -No, he got my name wrong.<br />-Get out there, you moron.
2350047 2352717 Bone Saw will eat you up<br />and spit you out.
2352850 2354919 I hope you brought your mommy.
2355086 2358689 -We'll break you!<br />-You'll need someone to cry to.
2359924 2365029 I'm gonna rip all eight of your<br />feeble legs off one by one.
2365629 2367665 Oh, my God!
2367832 2369533 Oh, my legs!
2369667 2372370 Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.
2372503 2374505 Kill! Kill! Kill!
2382680 2384115 Kill! Kill! Kill!
2384448 2385616 Cage!
2394892 2396460 Hello? Guys?
2397495 2402466 Will the guards please lock<br />the cage doors at this time?
2403033 2407471 This is some kind of mistake.<br />I didn't sign up for a cage match!
2408606 2411008 Unlock the thing!<br />Take the chain off!
2411175 2413010 Hey, freak show!
2413177 2415880 You're going nowhere.
2416013 2418516 I got you for three minutes.
2418649 2420885 Three minutes of playtime.
2427591 2430428 -What are you doing up there?<br />-Staying away from you.
2431128 2433798 That's a cute outfit.<br />Did your husband give it to you?
2440905 2442540 Finish him off!
2449680 2451115 Smash him!
2458456 2460057 -Hit him!<br />-Harder!
2462059 2464528 Kick his spider ass!
2466530 2467665 Hit him!
2481011 2482847 One, two, three!
2483013 2485850 That's it! That's it!<br />Winner!
2485983 2491055 Ladies and gentlemen, give it up<br />for the new champion, Spider-Man!
2491956 2495693 Spider-Man! Spider-Man!<br />Spider-Man!
2508572 2510107 Now get out of here.
2511809 2514678 A hundred bucks?<br />The ad said 3000.
2514845 2517147 Well, check it again, webhead.
2517281 2521185 It said three grand for three minutes.<br />You pinned him in two.
2521552 2524855 For that, I give you 100.<br />You're lucky to get that.
2524989 2526290 I need that money.
2526857 2529927 I missed the part<br />where that's my problem.
2538002 2541272 -Hey, what the hell--?<br />-Put the money in the bag.
2543140 2544608 Hurry up!
2550881 2552950 Hey! He stole the gate!
2553083 2555052 Stop that guy!
2555286 2557922 Stop him! He's got my money!
2558088 2559290 Thanks.
2560624 2563027 What's the hell's the matter with you?<br />You let him go!
2563160 2565329 Cut him off in the lobby<br />and call the cops!
2565663 2569700 You could've taken that guy apart.<br />Now he'll get away with my money.
2569833 2572036 I missed the part<br />where that's my problem.
2591655 2594592 -Sir, you gotta get back.<br />-I can't see. What happened?
2595793 2597094 Old dude, man.
2597261 2601599 Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.<br />Keep moving. Let's go!
2601732 2604602 -What happened?<br />-Someone got hurt.
2606904 2610074 -Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.<br />-Stay back.
2610674 2612343 -Stay back!<br />-That's my uncle!
2614678 2617247 -What happened?<br />-Carjacker. He's been shot.
2617381 2620918 We just called the paramedics.<br />They're on their way.
2621085 2622386 Uncle Ben?
2623320 2624922 Uncle Ben.
2628726 2629994 Uncle Ben?
2633697 2635099 Peter.
2636000 2637835 I'm here, Uncle Ben.
2643340 2644708 Peter.
2666697 2669733 They got the shooter.<br />He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.
2669900 2674672 We got three cars in pursuit.<br />All right, folks. Come on, move back.
2831595 2833597 Get a unit to the rear!
2836567 2838202 I got the back!
2851148 2852449 Who's there?
2878642 2881945 Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.<br />Give me a chance!
2882079 2886483 What about my uncle?<br />Did you give him a chance? Did you?
2886617 2888218 Answer me!
2891488 2892956 Stop that guy!
2898328 2900097 Thanks.
2910040 2911108 See you.
2932663 2936233 Freeze! We've got the place<br />completely surrounded.
2978642 2981311 Oh, no. My God.
2983280 2987050 Oh, no.<br />Oh, my God. No!
2995325 2998295 -Good evening.<br />-General. Good to see you.
2999129 3002032 Our exoskeleton's got<br />real firepower, general.
3002165 3007304 Well, if it does what you say it can,<br />I'll sign that contract tomorrow.
3008472 3011708 -He's clear, let's go!<br />-You're confident about this test?
3012075 3014277 Absolutely.<br />Captain Curtis is our top pilot.
3015078 3017681 Now, what about your commitment<br />to OSCORP?
3018014 3021752 Nothing would please me more than to<br />put Norman Osborn out of business.
3024221 3027257 Preflight complete. Mark.
3031361 3034064 We are picking up<br />an unidentified object, closing fast.
3034197 3035265 What the hell is that?
3035399 3036800 Can you see anything?
3037367 3038668 Oh, my God!
3049079 3051782 -Say "chess."<br />-Chess!
3052382 3054284 Peter!
3054451 3058388 Darling, I'm so proud of you.<br />You looked so handsome up there.
3058522 3062592 Pete? Good news. Dad got the place<br />in New York, so we're all set this fall.
3062726 3064394 -That's great.<br />-You made it.
3067063 3070467 It's not the first time<br />I've been proven wrong.
3071802 3074137 -Congratulations.<br />-Thanks, Dad.
3074538 3077073 Peter, the science award.<br />That's terrific.
3077474 3078708 Yeah.
3081678 3085182 I know this has been<br />a difficult time for you...
3085315 3088518 ...but I want you to try<br />to enjoy this day.
3088685 3090320 Commencement:
3090454 3094558 The end of one thing,<br />the start of something new.
3096426 3100163 I don't want to be with you anymore.<br />Here's your ring.
3100864 3102766 You know what? Whatever.
3103400 3104768 Your loss.
3105535 3109172 You're like a brother to Harry.<br />That makes you family.
3109306 3112275 And if you ever need anything,<br />just give me a call.
3126890 3129292 Can I fix you something?
3129426 3130827 No, thanks.
3175639 3177807 I missed him a lot today.
3180477 3181878 I know.
3183680 3185549 I miss him too.
3187350 3189619 But he was there.
3192756 3197928 I can't help thinking about<br />the last thing I said to him.
3198361 3203300 He tried to tell me something<br />important, and I threw it in his face.
3204901 3206970 You loved him...
3208705 3210907 ...and he loved you.
3211808 3215545 He never doubted<br />the man you'd grow into.
3215679 3219249 How you were meant<br />for great things.
3219683 3221952 You won't disappoint him.
3255585 3259723 With great power<br />comes great responsibility.
3259856 3263026 Remember that, Pete.<br />Remember that.
3273036 3274471 Hurry up!
3286750 3290553 He's not a man. My brother saw him<br />building a nest in Lincoln Center.
3290687 3293857 I think he's human, a man.<br />Could be a woman.
3297927 3300730 Bobby. Get a load of this!
3304000 3305902 He throws up his hands,<br />ropes come out...
3306036 3308071 ...and he climbs up them<br />like a spider web.
3308505 3312609 I see the web, his signature,<br />and I know Spider-Man was here.
3312742 3315445 The guy protects us,<br />protects the people.
3315578 3318381 Some kind of freaky-loo<br />or something. Wackadoo.
3318515 3320517 He stinks and I don't like him.
3321317 3322786 Don't move, lady!
3330860 3333663 Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.
3333830 3335932 He has those tights<br />and that tight little--
3336066 3339536 Dresses like a spider<br />He looks like a bug
3339703 3343506 But we should all just give him<br />One big hug
3343673 3348344 Look out<br />Here comes the Spider-Man
3351881 3355685 "Who is Spider-Man?"<br />He's a criminal, that's who he is.
3355819 3359723 A vigilante, a public menace.<br />Why's he on my front page?
3359889 3361825 Mr. Jameson, your wife needs--
3361958 3363493 There's a page-six problem.
3363626 3365562 We have a page-one problem.<br />Shut up.
3365695 3367130 -Well?<br />-He's news.
3367497 3369833 -The clients can't wait.<br />-They're about to.
3369966 3373970 -He pulled six people off a subway.<br />-From a wreck he probably caused.
3374104 3375839 Something goes wrong<br />and he's there.
3375972 3378441 Look! He's fleeing the scene.<br />What's that tell you?
3378575 3381411 He's not fleeing, he's probably<br />going to save somebody else.
3381544 3382579 He's a hero!
3382712 3385582 Then why does he wear a mask?<br />What's he got to hide?
3385715 3388818 She needs to know if you want<br />chintz or chenille in the dining room.
3388952 3391454 -Whichever is cheaper.<br />-Mr. Jameson, it's like this:
3391588 3392856 We double-booked page six.
3392989 3395458 So Macy's and Conway's both have<br />three quarters--
3395592 3398728 -We sold out four printings.<br />-Sold out?
3398862 3400063 Every copy.
3400730 3403133 Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one,<br />with a decent picture.
3403466 3405001 -Conway to page 7.<br />-That's a problem.
3405135 3407604 Page eight, give him 10 percent off.<br />Five percent.
3407737 3409506 -That can't be done.<br />-Get out of here!
3409639 3411574 We don't have a decent picture.
3411708 3414511 Eddie's been on it for weeks,<br />but we can barely see him.
3414644 3416746 Aw, what is he, shy?
3416880 3420884 If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts<br />in a thong, we can get this weirdo.
3421017 3424554 Put an ad on the front page:<br />"Cash for a picture of Spider-Man."
3424687 3428057 He doesn't wanna be famous?<br />I'll make him infamous!
3439436 3440503 Hey!
3440637 3441971 Buzz off.
3442739 3445708 -M.J., it's me, Peter.<br />-Hi!
3447477 3452182 -What are you doing around here?<br />-Begging for a job. How about you?
3452782 3456553 -I'm headed to an audition.<br />-An audition? So you're acting?
3456686 3457720 Yeah.
3457887 3461791 I work steady.<br />In fact, I just got off a job.
3461925 3463059 That's great.
3463726 3466896 -You're doing it. Living your dream.<br />-Glamour girl!
3467030 3468731 Your drawer was short $6!
3468865 3471568 Next time that happens,<br />I'll take it out of your check.
3472635 3476473 Excuse me, Miss Watson?<br />I'm talking to you! Hey!
3476639 3478875 Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.
3479008 3483112 It better not happen no more.<br />Don't roll your eyes at me.
3490086 3491855 Some dream, huh?
3492755 3495258 It's nothing to be<br />embarrassed about.
3495592 3498228 -Don't tell Harry.<br />-Don't tell Harry?
3498761 3503233 Don't you guys live together?<br />We're going out. Didn't he tell you?
3503766 3505235 Oh, yeah. Right.
3505635 3508705 I think he'd hate the idea<br />of my waiting tables.
3508838 3513176 -He'd think it was low or something.<br />-It's not low. You have a job.
3513643 3517914 You know, Harry doesn't live on<br />a little place I like to call Earth.
3519516 3521251 No, I guess not.
3526256 3527924 Thanks, Pete.
3529259 3531194 We should catch up sometime.
3535565 3538001 Let's get some lunch some evening.
3539202 3543806 I'll come by and have some of your<br />Moondance coffee someday.
3543973 3546743 -And I won't tell Harry.<br />-No, don't tell Harry.
3546876 3548077 I won't.
3550213 3552015 I won't tell Harry.
3563259 3565828 Timing's perfect. Hey.
3565995 3569232 Five new contracts. It'll be great.
3571334 3574070 Storming Norman's<br />making his weekly inspection.
3574938 3577140 Spent half of it on the phone.
3577807 3582579 Look, man, I'm glad you're here.<br />I need your help. I'm really lost here.
3583246 3584681 Are you all right?
3585949 3590587 You look like you just got<br />second place in the science fair.
3591821 3594757 I was late for work<br />and Dr. Connors fired me.
3594891 3596359 You were late again?
3597060 3599862 I don't get it.<br />Where do you go all the time?
3601164 3602365 Around.
3602699 3604267 Peter Parker.
3604734 3607136 -Maybe you'll tell me who she is.<br />-Who's that?
3607270 3610340 -This mystery girl Harry's been dating.<br />-Dad.
3610840 3612375 -When do I get to meet her?<br />-Dad.
3612709 3615945 Well, sorry.<br />Harry hasn't mentioned her.
3618848 3622051 Pete, you're probably looking<br />for a job now, right?
3622218 3625088 Dad, maybe you can help him out.
3625221 3629692 -No, I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.<br />-It's no problem. I'll make a few calls.
3629826 3634063 No, I couldn't accept it, sir.<br />I like to earn what I get. I'll find work.
3634197 3635932 I respect that.
3636699 3638801 You want to make it<br />on your own steam.
3639335 3640803 That's great.
3641704 3643973 What other skills do you have,<br />Parker?
3644140 3646109 I was thinking about photography.
3649212 3650413 Hello.
3652348 3654784 Let's go! Move it!
3655918 3657654 Watch the street!
3673002 3674303 Cheese!
3683246 3684681 They're crap.
3684847 3687817 Crap, crap. Megacrap.
3687984 3691120 -I'll give you $200 for all of them.<br />-That seems a little low.
3691287 3693089 Take them somewhere else, then.
3693222 3695858 Your wife says the tile for the foyer<br />is out of stock.
3695992 3697694 Tell her we'll put a rug there.
3697994 3699962 Sit down. Give me that.
3701431 3704067 Give you 300.<br />That's the standard freelance fee.
3704200 3706469 -Tear up page one. Run that photo.<br />-Headline?
3706903 3710139 "Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?<br />Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos."
3710273 3712141 Menace? He was protecting<br />that armored--
3712275 3713309 Tell you what, Atticus.
3713443 3716212 You take the pictures,<br />I'll make up the headlines. Okay?
3716345 3718347 -Yes, sir.<br />-Goody.
3718915 3722318 Give this to the girl up front.<br />She'll see you get paid.
3722919 3725722 -I'd like a job, sir.<br />-No jobs. Freelance.
3725888 3727390 Best thing for a kid your age.
3727757 3731994 You bring me more shots<br />of that clown, maybe I'll buy them.
3732161 3735131 But I never said you have a job.<br />Meat.
3735264 3739502 I'll send you a box of Christmas<br />meat. Bring me more photos.
3741170 3742338 -Hi.<br />-Hi.
3742505 3746042 Mr. Jameson told me<br />to give that to you.
3747110 3750213 -Welcome to the Daily Bugle.<br />-Thank you.
3750847 3752148 I'm Peter Parker.
3754751 3756886 I'm a photographer.
3757520 3760156 Yes. I can see that.
3767930 3769799 As of today...
3769932 3773936 ...OSCORP Industries has surpassed<br />Quest Aerospace...
3774137 3778474 ...as the principal supplier<br />to the United States military.
3778808 3781477 In short, ladies and gentlemen<br />of the board...
3781811 3784947 ...costs are down,<br />revenues are up...
3785148 3788017 ...and our stock<br />has never been higher.
3788151 3792488 Wonderful news, Norman.<br />That's why we're selling the company.
3793523 3794557 What?
3794924 3800062 Quest is recapitalizing in the wake<br />of the bombing. Expanding.
3800229 3803032 They made a tender offer<br />we can't ignore.
3803166 3804300 Why wasn't I told?
3804433 3808504 They don't want a power struggle<br />with entrenched management.
3808938 3811174 The deal is off if you come with it.
3811307 3814844 The board expects your resignation<br />in 30 days.
3815011 3816979 You can't do this to me.
3820116 3822351 I started this company.
3823386 3825922 You know how much I sacrificed?!
3829592 3835164 -Oh, Max. Please.<br />-Norman, the board is unanimous.
3835598 3839602 We're announcing the sale<br />after the World Unity Festival.
3839936 3841337 I'm sorry.
3842338 3844440 You're out, Norman.
3854350 3855952 Am I?
3860022 3863059 Welcome to OSCORP Industries<br />Unity Day Festival.
3863192 3866529 Let's hear it for Macy Gray.
3903099 3906502 M.J., why didn't you wear<br />the black dress?
3907536 3911274 Just, I wanted to impress my father.<br />He loves black.
3911407 3916012 Well, maybe he'll be impressed<br />no matter what. You think I'm pretty.
3916479 3918981 I think you're beautiful.
3931627 3935031 M.J., would you do me a favor?<br />I forgot my drink inside.
3945207 3947310 -Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.<br />-Oh, Harry.
3948377 3953516 -Have you seen my father around?<br />-Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.
3965528 3968130 -What is that?<br />-Must be new this year.
3973035 3974236 What is that?
3974370 3975438 That's our glider!
3986649 3988217 What the hell was that?
4016545 4018080 Code three!
4034096 4036232 -Oh, my God! Harry!<br />-M.J.!
4042204 4045574 Harry! Help me! Harry!
4051547 4053349 Out, am I?
4057787 4060056 -Mary Jane!<br />-Harry!
4063159 4065061 Hello, my dear.
4066062 4067730 It's Spider-Man!
4079341 4081310 -Come on, move, kid.<br />-Billy!
4084713 4087183 Somebody help him!
4087349 4088551 No!
4090386 4092088 Mommy!
4093823 4095791 -Hold it!<br />-I surrender.
4096459 4098861 -Oh, boy.<br />-Hold it right there!
4104700 4106102 Impressive.
4130326 4133696 -Mary Jane!<br />-Help! Someone please help me!
4159188 4160222 Hold on!
4161757 4162758 Watch out!
4171867 4175704 We'll meet again, Spider-Man!
4177373 4179308 Hold on, Mary Jane!
4221317 4223852 Well, beats taking the subway.
4224220 4227389 Don't mind us.<br />She just needs to use the elevator.
4227556 4228657 Wait.
4228791 4229992 Who are you?
4230326 4232795 -You know who I am.<br />-I do?
4232962 4235631 Your friendly neighborhood<br />Spider-Man.
4247443 4251347 Incredible?<br />What do you mean he's incredible?
4252481 4256018 No. All right, wait.<br />Stay there. I'm gonna come over.
4256752 4258487 No, I'm gonna come--
4258754 4262291 All right. Fine.<br />Will you call me in the morning?
4262458 4265427 And we'll go and have breakfast<br />and...
4265561 4267796 ...I wanna buy you something.
4267930 4271400 Because I want to.<br />It'll make you feel better.
4272434 4275971 Okay. And what do you mean,<br />incredible?
4278841 4281343 All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.
4281477 4283279 Don't let the bedbugs--
4288884 4291854 She's all right.<br />She's just a little rattled.
4293622 4297326 Look, Pete, I should have<br />told you about us.
4298627 4301330 But you should know<br />I'm crazy about her.
4301463 4304500 It's just, you know,<br />you never made a move.
4305567 4306969 You're right.
4307903 4309505 I didn't.
4313509 4315844 I'm gonna get some rest.
4317046 4319448 I'm gonna stay up for a while.
4320516 4322318 What was that thing?
4322785 4324320 I don't know.
4325587 4328891 Whatever it is,<br />somebody has to stop it.
4344807 4346542 Somebody there?
4346742 4348777 Somebody.
4350045 4351680 Who said that?
4352414 4355684 Don't play the innocent with me.
4358053 4360789 You've known all along.
4364793 4366095 Where are you?
4366428 4370532 Follow the cold shiver<br />running down your spine.
4377373 4379041 I'm right here.
4380843 4382845 I don't understand.
4383846 4386982 Did you think it was coincidence?
4387383 4390819 So many good things,<br />all happening for you.
4390953 4394690 All for you. Norman.
4397126 4398660 What do you want?
4399094 4401130 To say what you won't.
4401563 4403999 To do what you can't.
4404133 4408804 To remove those in your way.
4412775 4414743 The board members.
4415978 4417479 You killed them.
4417613 4419114 We killed them.
4419448 4420582 We?
4420716 4422151 Remember?
4422484 4425020 Your little accident<br />in the laboratory.
4427022 4428724 The performance enhancers.
4428857 4433896 Bingo. Me!<br />Your greatest creation.
4434496 4438133 Bringing you<br />what you've always wanted:
4438467 4441170 Power beyond your wildest dreams.
4441503 4443906 And it's only the beginning.
4445507 4449778 There's only one who can stop us.
4450612 4453916 Or imagine if he joined us.
4458854 4461924 Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.
4462057 4465527 The Green Goblin. You like that?<br />Made it up myself.
4465661 4467162 These weirdos<br />all gotta have a name.
4467496 4468664 Mr. Jameson, Spider--
4468797 4470532 -Hoffman!<br />-Yeah?
4471700 4475471 Copyright the name "Green Goblin."<br />I want a quarter every time it's said.
4475604 4476738 How about "Green Meanie"?
4478040 4480943 Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.<br />That's slander.
4481076 4483545 It is not. I resent that.
4483745 4486548 Slander is spoken.<br />In print, it's libel.
4486715 4488217 You don't trust anybody.
4488784 4490586 I trust my barber.
4491186 4492888 What are you, his lawyer? Get out.
4493021 4495224 Let him sue me,<br />get rich like a normal person.
4495557 4497059 That's what made this country--
4505234 4508537 Jameson, you slime.
4508704 4511940 Who's the photographer<br />who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?
4512107 4513976 I don't know.<br />His stuff comes by mail.
4514109 4516044 -You're lying!<br />-I swear.
4516178 4518180 He's the one<br />who can bring me to him.
4518514 4521250 -I don't know who he is.<br />-You are useless.
4521617 4523819 Set him down, tough guy.
4524019 4528023 -Speak of the devil.<br />-I knew you two were in this together!
4528590 4531527 Hey, kiddo, let Mom and Dad<br />talk for a minute, will you?
4531693 4534062 Sleep....
4548644 4552648 Wake up, little spider. Wake up.
4552781 4557119 No, you're not dead yet.
4557286 4559621 Just paralyzed...
4559755 4561723 ...temporarily.
4562724 4565794 You're an amazing creature,<br />Spider-Man.
4565961 4568697 You and I are not so different.
4569264 4572734 I'm not like you. You're a murderer.
4572901 4575804 Well, to each his own.
4575938 4578907 I chose my path,<br />you chose the way of the hero.
4579641 4584146 And they found you amusing<br />for a while, the people of this city.
4584313 4587716 But the one thing they love<br />more than a hero...
4587883 4591353 ...is to see a hero fail,<br />fall, die trying.
4591687 4596158 In spite of everything you've done for<br />them, eventually, they will hate you.
4596291 4597326 Why bother?
4597693 4602264 -Because it's right.<br />-Here's the real truth.
4602798 4605801 There are eight million people<br />in this city.
4605968 4610205 And those teeming masses exist<br />for the sole purpose...
4610372 4614343 ...of lifting the few exceptional<br />people onto their shoulders.
4614676 4616011 You, me...
4616678 4618614 ...we're exceptional.
4618814 4623352 I could squash you like a bug<br />right now.
4623719 4627222 But I'm offering you a choice.<br />Join me.
4627389 4631059 Imagine what we could<br />accomplish together.
4631226 4634029 What we could create.
4634696 4636698 Or we could destroy.
4636832 4640802 Cause the deaths of countless<br />innocents in selfish battle...
4640969 4643305 ...again and again and again until<br />we're both dead.
4643639 4645874 Is that what you want?
4647876 4650779 Think about it, hero.
4662758 4668030 In spite of everything you've done for<br />them, eventually, they will hate you.
4677105 4678140 Hey!
4678273 4679875 -It's me again.<br />-Hey!
4680175 4681710 How was your audition?
4681877 4684880 -How'd you know?<br />-The hot line. Your mom...
4685013 4686982 ...told my aunt, told me.
4687349 4688817 So you just came by?
4688984 4692688 I was in the neighborhood.<br />Needed to see a friendly face.
4692821 4696391 I took two buses and a cab<br />to get in the neighborhood, but....
4697693 4699094 So how'd it go?
4701229 4703899 They said I needed acting lessons.
4704032 4707836 A soap opera told me<br />I needed acting lessons.
4707969 4713241 Let me buy you a cheeseburger.<br />The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.
4714710 4716778 I'd like a cheeseburger.
4717145 4720716 Oh, but I'm going out to dinner<br />with Harry.
4721049 4722384 Come with us.
4722718 4725320 No, thanks. How's it going with...?
4727255 4729858 Never mind.<br />That's none of my business.
4730258 4731860 It's not?
4733195 4734930 Why so interested?
4735464 4737065 I'm not.
4737265 4738767 You're not?
4740268 4743071 -Well, why would I be?<br />-I don't know.
4743271 4745107 Why would you be?
4747008 4749277 I, that's a--
4749444 4751046 I don't know.
4753215 4756084 Sorry you won't come with us.
4758453 4760422 I better run, tiger.
4769197 4771199 Hey, check it out, man.
4771333 4773068 Come on, man.
4776505 4779908 Hey, where you going, baby?<br />Come on!
4797826 4799194 Get off me!
4832427 4834029 Wait!
4838900 4841203 You have a knack<br />for getting in trouble.
4841336 4845841 You have a knack for saving my life.<br />I think I have a superhero stalker.
4846007 4847909 I was in the neighborhood.
4849611 4852314 You are amazing.
4853281 4856051 Some people don't think so.
4857118 4860121 -But you are.<br />-Nice to have a fan.
4860922 4864092 Do I get to say thank you this time?
4865360 4866394 Wait.
4935397 4937532 Let me in! My baby's in there!
4937666 4939935 -Let me go!<br />-The roof's collapsing!
4940068 4943471 -Somebody save my baby!<br />-The roof's about to collapse!
4943638 4945106 Look! Up there!
4951947 4953481 Save my baby, please!
4977238 4978373 No!
4986147 4990151 -It's okay. Your baby's fine.<br />-Oh, my baby!
4991186 4994122 God bless you, Spider-Man.<br />Bless you.
4994255 4996091 Don't let him get away!
4996257 4999461 Hold it! You're under arrest.<br />I'm taking you in.
4999594 5001997 Oh, my God, there's somebody<br />still up there!
5004232 5005266 I'm going.
5007435 5010472 -I'll be here when you get back.<br />-Not coming back, chief.
5011006 5012107 Go! Go!
5021049 5022617 Where are you?
5024652 5026321 Where are you?
5031626 5034129 I'm gonna get you out of here!
5036598 5038199 It's okay.
5045240 5047709 You're pathetically predictable.
5048043 5049778 Like a moth to the flame.
5050678 5053248 What about my generous proposal?
5054282 5057152 Are you in, or are you out?
5057318 5059788 It's you who's out, Gobby.<br />Out of your mind.
5060221 5062323 Wrong answer.
5063591 5065193 Oh, great.
5103731 5106568 No one says no to me!
5113842 5117378 -M.J., will you stop goofing around?<br />-Harry, relax.
5119781 5121182 He's here.
5121816 5124519 -Are you ready?<br />-Yeah.
5125286 5127822 Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.
5128189 5131259 Work was murder.<br />I picked up a fruitcake.
5131426 5134762 Thank you, Mr. Osborn.<br />We're so glad you could come.
5135163 5137732 Who is this lovely young lady?
5137866 5142303 I'd like you to meet my father.<br />Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.
5142470 5145206 I've been looking forward<br />to meeting you.
5145373 5149144 -Happy Thanksgiving, sir.<br />-Now, where is Peter?
5149277 5151579 He'd better have remembered<br />that cranberry sauce.
5157418 5160855 Oh, that's weird.<br />I didn't know he was here.
5163858 5165460 Peter?
5170231 5171699 Peter?
5173501 5175270 Is that you?
5180642 5184779 How strange. There's nobody here.
5191352 5195757 -Bit of a slob, isn't he?<br />-All brilliant men are.
5228423 5230925 -Hey, everyone.<br />-Oh, Peter!
5231259 5232927 Sorry I'm late,<br />it's a jungle out there.
5233261 5236931 I had to beat an old lady with a stick<br />to get these cranberries.
5237498 5240368 Thank you.<br />Now then, everybody sit down...
5240501 5241970 ...and we can say grace.
5243638 5245306 Parker.
5245607 5247408 Here we go.
5254382 5256651 -There we are.<br />-It looks delicious.
5257252 5258653 Norman.
5260488 5262724 Will you do the honors?
5274469 5277672 Why, Peter, you're bleeding.
5279474 5281342 Oh, yeah....
5281476 5285813 I stepped off a curb and got clipped<br />by one of those bike messengers.
5285947 5287582 Well, let me see.
5287749 5289417 Oh, my goodness.
5289550 5291886 -Oh, that looks awful.<br />-No, it's nothing.
5292020 5295323 I'll get the first-aid kit.<br />Then we'll say grace.
5295490 5300728 This is the boys' first Thanksgiving<br />here, and we'll do things properly.
5301696 5304766 How did you say that happened?
5305300 5306868 Bike messenger.
5307035 5309003 Knocked me down.
5314509 5318313 -If you'll excuse me, I've got to go.<br />-Why?
5318980 5322483 Something<br />has come to my attention.
5322650 5323851 Are you all right?
5324018 5327622 I'm fine, just fine.<br />Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.
5328323 5330625 -Enjoy the fruitcake.<br />-Dad!
5332760 5336597 I planned this so you'd meet M.J.,<br />and now you have to leave?
5336764 5338533 I've got to go.
5338766 5342870 -This girl is important to me.<br />-Harry, please. Look at her.
5343037 5347008 Think she's sniffing around<br />because she likes your personality?
5347408 5350411 -What are you saying?<br />-Your mother was beautiful too.
5350545 5351679 They're all beautiful.
5351813 5355883 Until they're snarling after your trust<br />fund like a pack of ravening wolves.
5356050 5357485 You're wrong about her, Dad.
5357885 5361022 A word to the not-so-wise<br />about your little girlfriend:
5361389 5363925 Do what you need to with her,<br />then broom her fast.
5375636 5378039 Thanks for sticking up for me,<br />Harry.
5378406 5381375 -You heard?<br />-Everyone heard that creep.
5381542 5385446 That creep is my father.<br />With luck, I'll be half of what he is.
5385646 5387915 Shut up about stuff<br />you don't understand!
5388049 5389784 Harry Osborn!
5390852 5392887 I'm sorry, Aunt May.
5395857 5399127 Spider-Man is all but invincible.
5399460 5402597 But Parker, we can destroy him.
5402730 5403998 I can't.
5404132 5407135 Betrayal<br />must not be countenanced.
5407535 5409737 Parker must be educated.
5412140 5413141 What do I do?
5413474 5417545 Instruct him in the matters<br />of loss and pain.
5417678 5420715 Make him suffer.<br />Make him wish he were dead.
5420915 5422150 Yes?
5422483 5424418 And then grant his wish.
5425153 5426587 But how?
5426754 5430992 The cunning warrior attacks<br />neither body nor mind.
5431159 5432493 Tell me how!
5432627 5434762 The heart, Osborn.
5434962 5437999 First, we attack his heart.
5439901 5443504 Give us this day our daily bread,<br />and forgive us our trespasses...
5443671 5446641 ...as we forgive those<br />who trespass against us.
5446941 5449844 Lead us not into temptation,<br />but deliver us--
5458519 5460955 Deliver us!
5461122 5462623 Finish it!
5462857 5466794 -Finish it!<br />-From evil!
5472900 5474702 Two milligrams IV.
5476537 5477738 Get the BP.
5478072 5481742 Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?<br />What happened?
5481909 5483177 You have to leave.
5483511 5485079 -What happened?<br />-Those eyes!
5485246 5489483 Those horrible yellow eyes!
5494155 5496791 He knows who I am.
5540768 5542236 I'm sorry.
5546007 5548576 -Will she be okay?<br />-She's gonna be fine.
5548709 5551245 She's been sleeping all day.
5552246 5555049 -Thanks for coming.<br />-Of course.
5559186 5562123 How are you?<br />You okay about the other night?
5562256 5565993 Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad<br />about leaving Aunt May.
5566193 5569163 -Have you talked to Harry?<br />-He called me.
5569730 5571866 I haven't called him back.
5573935 5575703 The fact is...
5576837 5579707 -...I'm in love with somebody else.<br />-You are?
5579840 5581008 At least I think I am.
5583744 5586781 -It's not the right time to talk about it.<br />-No. Go on.
5586914 5590117 Would I know his name, this guy?
5590284 5593187 You'll think I'm a stupid little girl<br />with a crush.
5593321 5594822 Trust me.
5595022 5596223 It's funny.
5598225 5601729 He's saved my life twice,<br />and I've never even seen his face.
5602330 5605833 -Oh. Him.<br />-You're laughing at me.
5606000 5608970 No, I understand.<br />He is extremely cool.
5609136 5612373 But do you think it's true, all the<br />terrible things they say about him?
5612707 5616644 No, no. Not Spider-Man,<br />not a chance in the world.
5616811 5618312 I know him a little bit.
5618679 5621382 I'm sort of his unofficial<br />photographer.
5621749 5624852 -Has he mentioned me?<br />-Yeah.
5625119 5626687 What'd he say?
5627154 5628622 I said....
5629690 5633928 He asked me<br />what I thought about you.
5634862 5636897 And what did you say?
5637665 5641736 I said, "Spider-Man."
5642003 5646907 I said, "The great thing about M.J...
5647074 5648709 ...is...
5649643 5652847 ...when you look in her eyes...
5655282 5658652 ...and she's looking back in yours...
5659653 5662656 ...everything feels...
5663824 5665693 ...not quite normal.
5666894 5668729 Because you feel...
5669163 5670865 ...stronger...
5672299 5676003 ...and weaker at the same time.
5677038 5679140 You feel excited...
5680041 5682076 ...and at the same time...
5682777 5684278 ...terrified.
5686747 5690985 The truth is, you don't know<br />what you feel...
5692319 5696023 ...except you know what kind of man<br />you want to be.
5698793 5700694 It's as if you've...
5701195 5704331 ...reached the unreachable...
5706000 5708769 ...and you weren't ready for it."
5712139 5713941 You said that?
5714775 5717044 Well, something like that.
5761288 5762890 Dad?
5768162 5770231 Dad, is that you?
5776904 5778305 What is it?
5780508 5785513 Well, you were right about M.J.<br />You're right about everything.
5786514 5789283 She's in love with Peter.
5789517 5791352 -Parker?<br />-Yeah.
5791485 5793454 And how does he feel about her?
5796123 5798559 He's loved her since the 4th grade.
5799527 5804932 He pretends like he doesn't, but<br />there's no one Peter cares for more.
5807868 5809470 I'm so sorry.
5812039 5815409 I haven't always been there for you,<br />have I?
5817211 5820347 You're busy. You're an important man.<br />I understand.
5820481 5822383 That's no excuse.
5823384 5825219 I'm proud of you.
5825853 5830558 I've lost sight of that somewhere.<br />But I'll make it up to you.
5830891 5834161 I'm going to rectify<br />certain inequities.
5848209 5850044 Wake up, little spider.
5850177 5851579 Wake up.
5853047 5854515 Go home, dear.
5854882 5856150 You look awful.
5856317 5858519 -And you look beautiful.<br />-Well, thank you.
5858852 5862156 -I don't like to leave you here.<br />-But I'm safe here.
5862289 5865059 -Can I do anything for you?<br />-You do too much.
5865192 5870631 College, a job, all this time with me.<br />You're not Superman, you know.
5871432 5873234 A smile. Finally.
5873367 5876570 Haven't seen one of those on<br />your face since Mary Jane was here.
5876904 5880207 Hey.<br />You were supposed to be asleep.
5881041 5885879 You know, you were about 6 years old<br />when M.J.'s family moved in next door.
5886046 5890017 And when she got out of the car,<br />and you saw her for the first time...
5890150 5896423 ...you grabbed me and said,<br />"Aunt May, is that an angel?"
5896590 5900227 -Gee, did I say that?<br />-You sure did.
5902963 5905566 Well, Harry's in love with her.
5905933 5909536 -She's still his girl.<br />-Well, isn't that up to her?
5909903 5914375 -She doesn't really know who I am.<br />-Because you won't let her.
5914541 5917645 You're so mysterious all the time.
5918045 5920648 Tell me, would it be so dangerous...
5921015 5924985 ...to let Mary Jane know<br />how much you care?
5925319 5927921 Everybody else knows.
5930958 5932092 I'll be right back.
5932693 5934128 But....
5941402 5943404 Come on, pick up.
5943537 5946974 -Hey, M.J.--<br />-Hi, it's me. Sing your song at the beep.
5948008 5950044 M.J., it's Peter. You there?
5950277 5953147 Hello? You there?
5953547 5958152 I'm just calling to check up on you.<br />Will you call me when you get in?
5958285 5959620 All right, well....
5959953 5961188 Don't....
5962022 5964191 Don't go up any dark alleys.
5964358 5965959 Hello?
5968295 5972066 Can Spider-Man come out to play?
5972232 5974034 Where is she?
6020247 6021782 -What is that?<br />-That's cool!
6022116 6026653 The itsy-bitsy spider<br />Went up the water spout
6026787 6031125 Down came the goblin<br />And took the spider out
6047775 6049543 Goblin, what have you done?
6092152 6095823 Spider-Man!<br />This is why only fools are heroes.
6096356 6097825 Because you never know...
6098192 6102830 ...when some lunatic will come along<br />with a sadistic choice:
6104097 6106567 Let die the woman you love...
6110871 6116143 ...or suffer the little children.
6118445 6120814 -Spider-Man!<br />-Save us!
6121448 6123650 Save us!
6123851 6126520 Make your choice, Spider-Man...
6126687 6130190 ...and see how a hero is rewarded.
6130324 6132392 Don't do it, Goblin!
6132526 6135462 We are who we choose to be.
6135662 6138465 -Now, choose!<br />-No!
6167227 6168695 Everybody stay still!
6178305 6179573 Ahoy up there!
6179706 6182643 We're gonna bring the barge<br />right under you.
6190250 6194354 -He's coming back!<br />-Listen. I need you to climb down.
6194488 6195889 -I can't.<br />-Yes, you can!
6200961 6204197 M.J., you can do it. You have to.
6204331 6205799 Trust me.
6207401 6211271 Hold on tight and go quickly.
6215542 6217578 -Hurry!<br />-I can't. I can't do it.
6217744 6219479 Hang on, Mary Jane!
6247841 6250544 -He's not gonna make it.<br />-He's gonna make it!
6260454 6263624 It's time to die.
6270631 6273000 Come on up here, tough guy,<br />I got something for you!
6273333 6274501 We ought to kick your ass!
6274668 6277971 Leave Spider-Man alone! You're<br />gonna pick on a guy saving kids?
6278705 6280273 I got something for your ass!
6280407 6282309 Mess with Spidey,<br />you mess with New York!
6282442 6284811 You mess with one of us,<br />you mess with all of us!
6298492 6300327 Spider-Man, watch out!
6332025 6336430 Misery, misery, misery.<br />That's what you've chosen.
6337364 6339866 I offered you friendship...
6340000 6341902 ...and you spat in my face.
6392986 6396723 You've spun your last web,<br />Spider-Man.
6396857 6400127 Had you not been so selfish,<br />your little girlfriend's death...
6400460 6402028 ...would have been quick<br />and painless.
6402162 6405665 But now that you've really<br />pissed me off...
6405866 6410771 ...I'm gonna finish her<br />nice and slow.
6415442 6417477 M.J. and I...
6418145 6421581 ...we're gonna have a hell of a time.
6475235 6476870 Peter, stop!
6477003 6479573 Stop! It's me.
6488548 6489916 Mr. Osborn.
6490050 6491718 Peter, thank God for you.
6491885 6494120 You killed those people<br />on that balcony.
6494487 6497524 The Goblin killed!<br />I had nothing to do with it!
6497657 6499259 Don't let him take me again.
6499593 6501628 I beg you. Protect me.
6501761 6505198 You tried to kill Aunt May.<br />You tried to kill Mary Jane.
6505565 6506967 But not you.
6507701 6511671 I tried to stop it.<br />But I couldn't stop it.
6511838 6513907 I would never hurt you.
6514074 6516009 I knew from the beginning...
6516176 6519112 ...if anything ever happened to me...
6519246 6521581 ...it was you I could count on.
6521715 6524985 You, Peter Parker, would save me,<br />and so you have.
6525652 6527520 Thank God for you.
6528521 6529856 Give me your hand.
6530991 6534527 Believe in me,<br />as I believed in you.
6535862 6538698 I've been like a father to you.
6540133 6541868 Be a son to me now.
6543703 6545605 I have a father.
6546206 6548808 His name was Ben Parker.
6550710 6552078 Godspeed, Spider-Man.
6571031 6572632 Peter.
6574901 6576136 Don't tell Harry.
6608335 6610103 What have you done?
6610236 6611905 What have you done?!
6635128 6636730 Hey.
6640033 6642068 I'm so sorry, Harry.
6643003 6646106 I know what it's like<br />to lose a father.
6648241 6651678 I didn't lose him.<br />He was stolen from me.
6653146 6655382 One day Spider-Man will pay.
6657283 6660387 I swear on my father's grave,<br />Spider-Man will pay.
6665392 6667260 Thank God for you, Peter.
6668028 6670397 You're the only family I have.
6695021 6697257 No matter what I do...
6697390 6700693 ...no matter how hard I try...
6701161 6705031 ...the ones I love will always<br />be the ones who pay.
6715875 6718078 You must miss him so much.
6719045 6722082 It's been so hard without him.
6725018 6727921 There's something<br />I've been wanting to tell you.
6729756 6731424 When I was up there...
6732192 6735028 ...and I thought I was gonna die...
6736729 6739332 ...there was only one person<br />who I was thinking of.
6741835 6745004 And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.
6746372 6748341 It was you, Pete.
6749809 6751511 I kept thinking:
6752045 6754881 "I hope I make it through this...
6756249 6760753 ...so I can see Peter Parker's face<br />one more time."
6762055 6763456 Really?
6763957 6769796 There's only one man<br />who's always been there for me...
6770997 6772966 ...who makes me feel...
6773333 6777103 ...like I'm more than I ever<br />thought I could be.
6779205 6780940 That I'm just...
6781474 6783076 ...me.
6784144 6786079 And that's okay.
6788214 6789816 The truth is...
6791918 6793553 ...I love you.
6795822 6797790 I love you so much, Peter.
6818344 6823183 All I wanted was to tell her<br />how much I loved her.
6823316 6825318 I can't.
6827353 6828988 You can't what?
6830089 6831457 Tell you...
6833226 6837497 ...everything.<br />I mean, there's so much to tell.
6838565 6842502 Yeah. There's so much to tell.
6843436 6845438 I want you to know...
6845939 6848474 ...that I will always be there<br />for you.
6848841 6852612 I will always be there<br />to take care of you.
6853613 6855615 I promise you that.
6859052 6861287 I will always be your friend.
6864224 6866125 Only a friend...
6867026 6868461 ...Peter Parker?
6870597 6873466 That's all I have to give.
6899959 6902495 Whatever life holds in store<br />for me...
6902629 6905531 ...I will never forget these words:
6905899 6910937 "With great power<br />comes great responsibility."
6911070 6913273 This is my gift.
6913406 6915508 My curse.
6916109 6918044 Who am I?
6918344 6919646 I'm Spider-Man.
