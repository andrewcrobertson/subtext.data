17852 19437 I'm John Dykstra.
19645 23524 Here today with me are Scott Stokdyk<br />and Anthony LaMolinara.
23691 25776 Anthony was director of animation.
25943 30198 Scott's the visual effects supervisor<br />for SPI. Imageworks.
30448 34577 And I am the visual effects designer.
37788 41334 This title sequence was done<br />by Imaginary Forces.
50384 55264 The important part of the relationship<br />between the people in visual effects...
55431 60436 ...and the people who were doing the<br />title sequence was obviously the web.
60686 66067 We worked with them to come up with<br />a web that gave the impression...
66317 70363 ...of the web that's in the movie,<br />but keep the stylized quality...
70529 75409 ...that our director wanted to have<br />for the title sequence.
105189 108734 Some of the volumes<br />that you see here...
108901 112697 ...the Spider-Man character, the hand,<br />the Goblin's face...
112947 118536 ...was interpreted from the geometry<br />that we used for our virtual character.
118786 122206 They simplified it and put it<br />into the sequence.
122373 125793 They were trying for<br />something that wasn't real.
126002 130631 They wanted a stylized version<br />of the web and the characters.
130798 131924 They succeeded.
132091 136053 - So we shared. There you are.<br />- Yeah, there I am. That's me.
136220 139473 - "Visual effects designed by."<br />- Yeah.
141642 145396 We shared a couple models,<br />passed some models over.
154864 157825 I hope we get to do the next one.
159243 162830 - The next set of titles.<br />- The next opening sequence.
169045 173674 It's interesting, because<br />it's this sort of period graphic...
173841 180097 ...that goes on the front of a movie<br />that is fairly starkly real.
187313 192902 If we did these as photo-realistic<br />webs for this whole sequence...
193069 196280 ...it would have taken months.
198199 203788 This is the transition from<br />our stylized web into the real web.
203996 206499 The opening scene of the film.
206749 210169 The background for this<br />was shot in New York...
210378 215174 ...and they overlaid the synthetic web<br />from the title sequence...
215341 219637 ...across the cross-dissolve<br />to create the opening sequence.
220638 222848 Originally, wasn't it...
223015 228396 ...a cross-dissolve behind her head,<br />where the bus materialized?
228646 234110 There were a couple of different ideas<br />of introducing the opening sequence...
234276 237988 ...introducing Mary Jane,<br />whom the story is about...
238155 241867 ...as is said in the monologue.
242118 243702 But this was the...
244370 248791 This was chosen as the best means<br />to make that transition...
249041 254964 ...because it didn't leave us looking<br />at her for a huge amount of time.
255131 259343 - Don't even think about it.<br />- You're so lame, Parker.
265558 269270 That's a good look for Tobey<br />with those glasses.
272064 274483 And like that.
277445 279613 We shot all of this stuff...
279780 284535 Throughout the film, we used<br />live-action locations in New York.
286036 292001 In some cases we shot in Los Angeles<br />to be substituted for New York.
292668 297423 And sometimes we created components<br />completely synthetically...
297631 301844 ...that are added into both locations<br />in Los Angeles and New York...
302094 305764 ...to create our version<br />of New York City.
311687 315524 - Can we drive around the corner?<br />- Why?
315733 317526 The entrance is right there.
317693 321405 Dad, this is public school.<br />I can't show up in a Rolls.
321614 323949 I should trade my car for a Jetta...
324200 327661 Lot of setup here. Lot of exposition.
328370 331790 One of the things<br />that we're gonna talk about...
332333 337254 Working with Sam was terrific.<br />He's a very collaborative director.
337421 340382 Using his version of the script...
341050 345387 ...the script that he approved<br />and interpreted to us...
345596 350726 ...we started creating the preliminary<br />visual effects for this movie.
351185 357399 Sam not only welcomed...
357566 360486 ...contributions from people<br />on the crew...
360653 362071 ...he encouraged it.
362488 366992 He was the arbiter of all the stuff<br />used in the film, as the director...
367243 373624 ...but everybody got the feeling that<br />they had a vested interest in this...
373874 377920 ...in some very small part<br />as a filmmaker...
378087 382258 ...as well as whatever<br />their particular job was.
382424 385844 I think that comes through<br />in the sense of this movie.
386095 389348 I think it trickled on down<br />through the whole crew.
389557 394478 Our CG supervisors, Ken Hahn,<br />Peter Nofz and Dan Eaton...
394728 400442 ...they at different points had input<br />into the process, which was nice.
403279 405239 It's unreal.
405406 409201 Getting close to our first<br />effects shot. Any minute now.
409410 410869 The atomic spider.
411287 414915 One of the things about this story<br />is it's a period piece.
415124 419837 In the original origin, the character's<br />bitten by an irradiated spider.
420045 423465 We now know, if you get bitten<br />by an irradiated spider...
423674 427094 ...you'll probably get<br />radiation poisoning.
427261 432266 But in those days it imbued the<br />character with superhuman capabilities.
432516 438856 Rather than use a sort of old saw<br />for this superhero transition...
439064 442443 ...Sam brought the story<br />into a contemporary vein...
442693 448490 ...by using the DNA basis.
448699 453120 Genetics, this genome-splicing<br />capability...
453287 458334 ...as the component to cause<br />the transition from our normal kid...
458584 462546 ...to the superhero character,<br />Spider-Man.
462755 468469 That contemporary science brings<br />the film into a contemporary sense.
470137 473849 When she describes the characteristics<br />of all these spiders...
474016 477811 ...we think about what Spider-Man<br />will do with those powers.
478062 482608 It'll be a spider<br />trapped in a man's body...
483734 486737 ...dying to get out.
486945 490658 Over five painstaking years,<br />Columbia's research facility...
490866 494662 - You gonna talk to her now?<br />- Oh, no. Come on.
494828 497414 That's part of how<br />Spider-Man moves.
497665 501669 His molecular structure<br />has been changed after this bite...
501919 507466 ...so that he no longer moves according<br />to the physical rules we know...
507716 512721 ...with human bodies, but something<br />combined between human and spider.
514139 518143 - Like a Spider-Man?<br />- Just like that.
518310 522690 One of the things I point out<br />in the live-action material:
522940 525567 The personality of these characters...
525734 530197 ...both Tobey and Willem...
530364 534702 ...they are the basis...
534910 538997 ...for our hero and our villain.
539164 542876 Their postures, positions<br />and body language...
543085 546755 ...are an important part<br />of defining them as a character.
546922 551218 Keeping an eye on that, trying to<br />integrate that into the characters...
551468 554847 ...once they are masked<br />and dressed in costume...
555097 559560 ...was a very important part of<br />making the character seem...
559727 563522 ...like he was an extension<br />of the actor...
563689 566817 ...as we have seen him<br />without the costume.
571488 574491 Here's Tobey getting ready<br />to take his photo.
574742 578746 You did a lot of photography<br />a long time ago, didn't you, John?
578912 581039 Oh, yeah. That was me, actually.
581290 585419 I got bitten by a spider.<br />It bit me in my visual-effects lobe.
585586 588630 Trying to get the girls<br />by taking their picture.
588881 593469 I did fashion photography when<br />I was in college. It was terrific.
594303 597723 You do a headsheet.
597931 601518 - There's our first effects shot.<br />- There you go.
601727 605230 - The beautiful crawling spider.<br />- That pesky spider.
606315 611069 A close-up is coming up,<br />which was a lot harder on many levels.
611278 613781 That was a real spider, and...
615741 616784 Stand by.
617034 620662 This guy let the spider crawl<br />on his hand. It isn't Tobey.
620871 623373 The guy who did the spider shot quit.
623582 626835 This bite is so short.<br />It was a much longer shot...
627044 630672 ...and we just see a little snippet<br />of the actual bite.
631340 636220 It actually sits on his hand<br />and grinds into his fangs for a while.
638305 641058 Parker, let's do it.
641391 647981 To get that close-up of that hand<br />that the close-up spider was on...
648190 653320 - John, you want to talk about that?<br />- Yes, I'd be pleased to.
653487 654947 First matte painting.
655197 660828 The close-up of the hand was done<br />with a very special piece of optics...
660994 663914 ...designed for photo-microscopy...
664122 667042 ...which is microscopic photography.
667292 671046 We used special strobe lights<br />to illuminate the hand...
671296 676844 ...to give us enough brightness to make<br />the entire hand be in relative focus.
677094 682182 It was recorded at high speed to out<br />down on the quivering of the hand...
682391 684893 ...so we could put<br />our CG spider on there.
685143 687688 I talked over the guy<br />landing the glider.
687855 690941 We were just looking<br />at our first effects.
691149 694736 There's a practical glider,<br />but we added effects.
694945 698866 We added heat distortion,<br />thrusters coming out the bottom...
700951 702870 And heat distortion.
703120 705539 One thing that's interesting:
705747 709376 Sam's concept for this movie<br />was for it to be real.
709585 712963 It's not Metropolis. It's not Gotham.<br />It's New York...
713213 717759 ...right down to the pigeon droppings<br />and the rust underneath the pipes.
718010 724600 Throughout the film,<br />he'd ask us to pursue...
724766 730272 ...a very "real" effect<br />in all of these environments.
730439 733692 The toughest thing to do<br />when we made virtual versions...
733901 739114 ...of the characters and the objects<br />was putting in high-frequency noise.
739323 744119 By that, I mean the dirt and debris...
744745 746872 ...that populates our real life.
747080 750459 Dust bunnies under the bed,<br />stains on the wall...
750709 753337 ...the pigeon droppings<br />on the windowsill.
753503 758216 That's tough for a computer to do<br />because it's random, a chaotic event.
758467 763805 So although we were successful...
764056 766433 Scott can talk about<br />the procedures...
766683 772272 ...but we had our artists go back in<br />and add dirt to many sequences...
772481 779154 ...to give you the visual cues that<br />this is real, not computer-generated.
780238 785827 A lot of texture work on this movie.<br />Many thousand textures.
786036 789498 We figured out there were<br />62,000 textures painted.
789748 793460 A texture is a...?
793835 798882 It's basically just a color map<br />that's mapped onto objects...
799132 802636 ...and represents its texture,<br />if you will.
802803 805806 It represents its look...
806223 809309 Like taking the textures<br />from Tobey's face...
809476 813647 ...and laying them on<br />the model of Tobey's face...
813814 818193 ...to achieve the look and try<br />to make it look realistic.
818360 823865 - The texture is basically a photograph.<br />- Starts out as a photograph.
824199 827786 A photograph of the surface<br />you want to reproduce...
827953 831373 ...in the computer environment.
831581 833333 The artists add to it...
833500 837129 ...and then that photograph<br />could be shrink-wrapped...
837295 841717 ...or vacuum-formed onto the shape,<br />which we call the geometry...
841883 845387 ...of the person or the object<br />that we're creating.
845637 848849 Since the photograph contains<br />all of that detail...
849099 851643 ...you get that in your<br />representation.
851810 855147 This is not Tobey Maguire's body.
857107 858775 But he'd love to have it.
858942 862195 It was Tobey's head<br />mapped onto that body.
862362 867367 It was a big tracking job.<br />And color-correction job too.
868285 870495 <i>In this recombination lab...</i>
874916 879546 We did some digital color-timing<br />on many of these sequences.
879713 885886 When you take original photography<br />and bring it into the computer...
886344 889556 ...you have to make adjustments<br />to the color...
889723 893643 ...to make sure when you take it<br />out of the computer...
893894 897189 ...it will look like<br />the original photography.
897355 901985 This is a nice matte painting.<br />The OSCORP image.
902194 904905 Done by Ivo,<br />one of our matte painters.
905155 911703 The image from the computer<br />needs to cut back into the movie...
911953 914081 ...adjacent to original negatives.
914331 920545 Rather than make it significantly<br />different from the original photography...
920712 924591 ...we try and make it match<br />the original photography...
924758 928970 ...so when they do color correction,<br />everything falls into place.
929137 935477 But in many sequences, especially<br />with cross-dissolves and fades...
935727 939564 ...you have scene-to-scene<br />color timing that's critical.
939815 943527 So we did an awful lot<br />of digital color adjustment...
943777 948115 ...throughout those montage sequences.
948323 952452 I was wrong before. Ivo,<br />the head of our matte department...
952661 956081 ...painted the daytime<br />OSCORP lab exterior...
956248 959334 ...and Dave Bleisch<br />painted the nighttime version.
961419 968260 Norman Osborn is put into this thing,<br />this dramatic moment...
968426 971930 ...and he goes, "It's cold!"<br />when he straps him in.
972097 975517 I think that's pretty interesting.
976101 980021 We're coming up to the green gas<br />modification shots.
980188 985902 They didn't want to shoot with<br />toxic green gas, for some reason.
986111 987612 I don't understand it.
987779 992492 So our friends at Digiscope<br />did a handful of shots...
992659 996872 ...maybe 10 to 15 color-correction<br />shots on the gas.
1009050 1013138 Started out as white smoke<br />and got turned into green.
1017851 1019102 Norman?
1020020 1023690 One of the things Anthony<br />talked about earlier was...
1023857 1028570 ...characters going from being<br />human to superhuman.
1028778 1032532 One of the things that people<br />talked about...
1032699 1037579 ...was whether or not we used<br />motion capture for our characters.
1038288 1041750 Although I have an opinion,<br />Anthony's might differ.
1041917 1045420 I think motion capture's<br />an interesting technique...
1045629 1051301 ...to get the detail that defines<br />a person's body language.
1051551 1056848 Motion capture is essentially a series<br />of measurement points attached...
1057057 1058808 ...to a person's body.
1059017 1062354 You have that person<br />go through a series of moves...
1062562 1065148 ...and then you record those points.
1065357 1070695 It allows you to then animate a<br />synthetic version of that character.
1070904 1076910 When we did our motion capture,<br />we got great high-frequency detail...
1077077 1080330 ...in terms of defining<br />a character's personality.
1080580 1085543 But if you have a character<br />jump off a three-foot-high box...
1085794 1088672 ...that high-frequency detail<br />gives away...
1088838 1091841 ...that all he did was jump off a box.
1092092 1098473 So the animators have to expand<br />the personality of this leap...
1098640 1101768 ...into something for a 100-foot fall.
1101935 1108525 Although the motion capture for<br />high-frequency detail was very good...
1108733 1110860 ...that same detail was a giveaway...
1111069 1115198 ...when we made him<br />do superhuman things.
1115365 1119286 That's Tobey's real body, by the way.
1119536 1121162 Superhuman.
1121329 1127002 As a result, the principal characters,<br />Goblin and Spider-Man...
1127252 1130005 ...were key-frame animated...
1130171 1132757 To use the high-frequency detail...
1132924 1135176 ...we had to do so much adjustment...
1135343 1141182 ...it would take longer to do it that<br />way than to animate it from the top.
1145020 1148398 Another thing about motion capture...
1148565 1152319 ...as the technology exists right now,<br />it is cumbersome.
1152485 1156156 You have to dress up in a Lycra suit...
1156323 1159909 ...and have these big, reflective balls<br />stuck all over you.
1160118 1163580 You can't go outside a 30-by-30 area.
1163872 1167834 There's a lot of new technology<br />that's being developed.
1168043 1171921 Hopefully, it'll be<br />a little less restrictive...
1172088 1175383 ...in how you capture the data,<br />and the setup for it.
1175633 1180513 Not that it'll necessarily influence<br />our choice of doing motion capture.
1180764 1185810 I always tell people how pissed off<br />the gorilla got in Hollow Man...
1186061 1190982 - ...when we stuck those balls on him.<br />- And shaved him. Or her.
1191149 1195320 We missed it. There were two<br />beautiful wire removals there.
1195487 1199366 Him flying out, the doctor flying out,<br />and Willem flying out.
1199532 1201743 As far as motion capture goes...
1201910 1206915 ...even if, say, a guy from<br />Cirque du Soleil...
1207123 1210001 ...could swing down<br />between the buildings...
1210210 1214714 ...the technology's not there<br />to capture that in that distance.
1214964 1219761 Yeah, it's too big. When you compress<br />that action into a small space...
1219928 1222639 ...it looks compressed<br />into a small space.
1222806 1227352 So the accuracy of the capture<br />is also a curse.
1227560 1232524 If you don't use a real actor you can tell<br />just because of the way he moves.
1233775 1236194 Anything Spider-Man would do...
1236361 1239864 ...shooting a web one way,<br />then changing directions...
1240031 1241825 The G-force on his body...
1242075 1247038 ...if it didn't rip his arm out,<br />would rip his whole body in half.
1247247 1250333 It's impossible for a person to do...
1250500 1255255 ...and therefore impossible<br />for a real person to fake.
1256256 1259717 Tobey looking at his hands<br />is a precursor...
1259884 1263179 ...to the close-up of his hands<br />that comes up.
1264848 1266724 Dad, are you all right?
1267767 1271813 - Dad's been out for a fun night.<br />- Exactly.
1272021 1276401 A couple of other things,<br />just definitions.
1276568 1283074 One, we decided that the Spider-Man<br />character wanted to be...
1283241 1286828 ...a mechanism by which<br />the audience experiences...
1286995 1290540 ...what it's like to swing<br />between buildings.
1290748 1294961 At the end of the film,<br />Sam wanted the audience...
1295170 1297589 ...to feel they had been Spider-Man.
1298006 1303553 The animators worked with a camera<br />as well as the character...
1303720 1308016 ...much like a skydiving team works.
1308224 1312145 The guy doing the performance<br />is photographed...
1312312 1315607 ...by his partner,<br />the skydiving photographer.
1315773 1318651 We're gonna see some webs<br />in a minute.
1319235 1322572 Lot of web shots.<br />One of our guys...
1322822 1327160 This is a mechanical rig,<br />where he catches all this stuff.
1327410 1329245 Yeah. He actually did that.
1331206 1336711 Pretty good. Take 156.
1338213 1339923 At any rate...
1340507 1344511 ...we decided that Spider-Man,<br />when he swung through the city...
1344719 1347305 ...would have his own<br />cameraman with him.
1347722 1350975 The cameraman had the same<br />abilities as Spider-Man...
1351184 1353436 ...and was able to operate the camera.
1353728 1359526 The cameraman gets better over the<br />course of the film as does Spider-Man.
1359817 1363071 He gets more adept<br />at doing the photography.
1363279 1367075 That's another way we added<br />this sense of reality to things.
1367325 1371496 This is a practical...<br />The first one's a practical web.
1373581 1376209 That's a real one, and then this...
1376417 1378169 That last one's a CG.
1379128 1383800 The first one was our effects shot.<br />That's practical, and then...
1384008 1386636 I can't even tell anymore.
1386803 1389722 Our guy, Theo,<br />set up this great web system...
1390515 1394769 ...including the dynamics and shading,<br />just to be multipurposed.
1394978 1400650 To work for small webs, and to work<br />for the large-scale webs he swings on.
1400858 1405822 This fight scene coming up,<br />as well as Wirework that's in this...
1405989 1409367 There is a wire attached,<br />lifting him up in the air...
1409534 1414914 ...or supporting him so he can<br />lean back and not lose his balance.
1415123 1419961 A lot of these shots were speeded up<br />in certain sections of this shot...
1420128 1422797 ...to give them more force,<br />like the punch.
1422964 1424882 John should talk about this.
1425049 1426884 Well, this is spider sense.
1427051 1431180 It's made up of all of the components<br />that you want to see...
1431347 1434100 ...when you think about<br />what Spider-Man can do.
1434267 1438062 It's expanded time.<br />Why don't you talk about the fight?
1439105 1444193 We took part of the punch and sped<br />it up so that there's more force...
1444402 1448281 ...and slowed it down at the right<br />moment so it's not so obvious.
1448489 1452702 And the one long shot where we see<br />that arm just glide by him...
1452910 1455872 ...and Tobey sees everything<br />in slow motion.
1456039 1458625 That's another idea<br />of the spider sense.
1458791 1462670 He's in one temporal realm,<br />they're all in a different one.
1464922 1468009 And here, for example,<br />when he grabs Flash's arm.
1468217 1472263 It's speeded up, then back<br />to real speed as he holds it...
1472430 1475391 ...and then it's speeded up again<br />for the punch.
1475642 1476893 Which one?
1477935 1484567 There were so many shots that were<br />sped up and slowed down.
1486653 1489822 Both Stan and Bob<br />liked experimenting with that.
1490031 1493493 - We tried a little bit of it too.<br />- All right.
1493993 1497705 Spider sense, by its very definition,<br />is time expansion.
1497872 1502543 Spider-Man slows everything down to<br />inspect all these potential threats.
1502710 1508216 The beginning of this, where you saw<br />the fly being inspected...
1508383 1511552 ...were events that he had<br />no control over.
1511761 1516015 His spider sense, which is newly<br />developed, checked out all this stuff.
1516182 1518643 It gives you a sense<br />of his ineptitude.
1518851 1522730 Next is a sequence where you see<br />his first experimentation...
1522897 1525483 ...with his newfound powers.
1525650 1530363 That's the spider's<br />genetic modification to his wrist.
1530988 1534742 It's not exactly where<br />the spinneret ought to be, but...
1535326 1539038 We figured putting it in<br />the right place might be a mistake.
1539414 1542750 There's the big microscopic hair shot.
1542917 1547088 - This is how he climbs up the wall.<br />- That was Theo's shot too.
1547255 1551926 A lot of tight tracking work<br />to get those to work too.
1552093 1556472 Here are our first real<br />digital environment shots, actually.
1556639 1561561 They're extension shots.<br />That's a fake alley floor there.
1561728 1563312 And there.
1565690 1571070 When we look up on the side,<br />it's all building extensions.
1572155 1575867 This was the beginning of<br />the personality for this camera.
1576033 1582081 The idea that the camera actually rose<br />with him, kind of stayed with him.
1582290 1587712 Keeping the camera with the character,<br />as opposed to watching him from afar.
1591340 1593342 Most of this is Wirework.
1593885 1595970 It's our video-game shots.
1596137 1599390 We were going to use a stuntman,<br />but they decided...
1599557 1605646 ...that it was not practical to do.<br />It was a little too dangerous.
1605855 1608858 Here's the first webs that he shoots.
1609025 1611736 He's figuring how<br />to control his webs...
1611944 1616949 ...and how to dictate where they go.
1617784 1619869 Up, up and away, web.
1621412 1625333 So the web, this is Theo's work...
1625500 1628503 ...has a huge range of personalities.
1628711 1633800 It comes out of his wrist, it's<br />thin and willowy in some cases.
1633966 1636260 It's big and strong in others.
1636427 1640014 It has to spread into an actual<br />spider web in some cases...
1640223 1644310 ...and in other cases it's a lump<br />on somebody's face.
1644519 1647897 An enormous effort went into<br />defining the web.
1648064 1653361 If you think about real webs, the<br />biggest problem is, they're invisible.
1653528 1656989 If bugs could see the webs,<br />they wouldn't fly into them.
1657156 1662245 We knew that, in order to meet<br />the expectations of an audience...
1662453 1666040 ...who knows of spider webs<br />as just glints...
1666249 1671420 ...we had to figure out a way to make<br />the web like a spider web...
1671629 1676259 ...in that it had what we called a<br />sundog defining it by highlight...
1676425 1680847 ...and keep enough volume<br />to feel it was strong enough...
1681013 1684684 ...to do whatever it was<br />we were asking the web to do.
1684892 1689146 There are a number of practical webs<br />intercut with our CG ones.
1689313 1693192 The web had to be flexible<br />enough to look practical...
1693359 1696028 ...or go away from that<br />when we needed to.
1696195 1700950 That last shot where he was swinging<br />on the web and hits the wall...
1701534 1708040 We'll see him almost do the same thing<br />when he's in his homemade spidey suit.
1708249 1711711 Then he just misses it<br />at the last moment.
1711878 1713880 Gotten a little better.
1714088 1716007 We've got this character arc.
1716173 1720052 He's not so facile<br />when he first gains that capability.
1720219 1723723 Over the course of the film,<br />he gets better and better.
1723890 1728895 You see that happen. Also, the way<br />he is followed through the film...
1729061 1732607 The camera work also gets<br />better and better.
1732773 1737737 So everybody's kind of got this same<br />learning curve.
1739655 1742408 I guess you can always hear us.
1742575 1744869 Everybody shouts.
1745286 1746621 Your aunt and uncle don't.
1746787 1749457 When we were shooting this stuff...
1749624 1753461 ...you see these scenes that last<br />two or three minutes...
1753628 1757673 ...yet it takes an entire night<br />to shoot this stuff.
1757882 1761177 This was a situation where<br />color correction was used.
1761761 1766599 Over the course of the evening,<br />we went from dusk to night to dawn.
1766766 1768893 And it wasn't shot in continuity.
1769060 1772438 In some cases,<br />they're taking light out of a scene.
1772605 1778486 In other cases, they're adding light<br />to make it all consistent throughout.
1781614 1785242 A difficult problem<br />when he was on the roof...
1785451 1791165 ...is that the actual size it needs<br />to be to see it in the distance...
1791332 1795670 ...is gigantic as opposed to<br />what it really would be.
1795836 1799215 Yet I buy it when I see it on screen.
1799382 1802426 The illusion in the service<br />of the story.
1802969 1807431 It's cinemagraphic license,<br />making the web change size.
1807598 1811227 Also, depending on the background...
1811394 1815690 ...we had to do different things<br />if it went over a bright sky.
1815856 1818901 The whiter specular hits<br />wouldn't show up as much.
1819068 1824657 You had to get some dark in there,<br />and sundogs running down too.
1824824 1831080 The web had several different states.<br />It's liquid when shot from his wrist.
1831247 1834709 As it attached to things,<br />it did a catalyzation...
1834875 1839922 ...which was a change of state,<br />like water becoming ice.
1840089 1845761 When it changed state, there was a<br />difference to the visual personality.
1845928 1850808 You can see when it strikes a building<br />when he swings through the city...
1850975 1856647 ...the web has a transition that occurs<br />once it's stuck to a surface.
1856814 1862153 He also seems, through some<br />psycho-physio process...
1862319 1865990 ...to make the web come out and have<br />different consistencies.
1866157 1871704 One time it would be hard as steel,<br />another it would be elastic...
1871871 1876167 ...and he could pull on it and<br />pop himself up to a building.
1880129 1883549 Just like a mutant spider could,<br />I'm sure.
1884216 1886135 Absolutely.
1890639 1894185 Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride<br />in my new birthday present.
1895269 1896562 Come on.
1897646 1898981 I gotta go.
1900066 1905279 Something I'd like to do in the sequel<br />is put Tobey's idiosyncrasies...
1905446 1909408 ...into the digital actor.
1910076 1914705 There's another alleyway.<br />Lots of alleyways in this movie.
1917249 1918501 Cool car.
1926842 1930721 John was talking about the performance<br />of the digital actor.
1930888 1933766 In this film, we're almost<br />working backward.
1933933 1938479 Usually you work<br />from the facial expression down...
1938646 1942024 ...as far as the hierarchy<br />of what gives the expression.
1942191 1945569 In this case,<br />there is no facial expression.
1945736 1951117 Spider-Man maybe has a jaw moving.<br />Goblin has nothing.
1951283 1953702 It's a very big challenge...
1953869 1957706 ...to try to let this digital actor...
1957873 1961127 ...emote from body movement.
1962419 1967466 Goblin is certainly more complex<br />than Spider-Man...
1967633 1973264 ...with his Shakespearean moves<br />and psychotic personality...
1973430 1977143 ...that goes from kind to sadistic.
1977309 1982106 That was a very big challenge,<br />something we'll develop more next time.
1982273 1988195 The interesting thing about<br />the personality of this character...
1988362 1992408 Sam asked, and maybe<br />you can give input...
1992575 1997663 ...that we use some of the classic<br />Spider-Man poses...
1997872 2001709 ...to brand this character<br />from the comic books.
2001917 2006130 I know the animators<br />had that stuff as reference.
2006297 2010885 Do you have a sense of<br />how you integrated that stuff?
2011051 2014513 Certainly, we worked<br />from all of the comics...
2014680 2021061 ...then tried to figure out what pose<br />works best in a given situation.
2021228 2024648 If he's perched,<br />waiting for something.
2024815 2027943 In the last swing,<br />there are a lot of...
2028110 2032364 ...typical key Spider-Man poses.
2032531 2035075 When his hands are raised<br />over his head...
2035242 2039580 ...his wrists are arched and<br />his fingers are in a formation.
2039747 2043667 That's a good example of these poses.
2043834 2047630 It comes from the storyboard artist<br />and animators...
2047796 2051091 ...on up through me, you, Sam...
2051258 2055971 ...and everybody else who's<br />watching this film on a daily basis.
2056222 2061143 The other interesting thing...<br />You talked about Willem Dafoe.
2061310 2067441 When we started defining what the<br />Goblin would be like as a character...
2067608 2071654 ...we started with this conveyance,<br />the Goblin glider.
2071820 2077660 We built a simulator,<br />a motion base with a glider attached.
2077826 2081247 It boiled down to something<br />like a mechanical bull...
2081413 2085376 ...only you had to stand on it.<br />It was an ankle-breaker.
2085542 2088921 We worked with the stunt people<br />to figure out a way...
2089088 2094218 ...to come up with something<br />to give them a timing choreography...
2094426 2097096 ...so when it moved,<br />they'd anticipate it...
2097263 2103519 ...and position themselves to look<br />as if they're affecting the machine.
2103686 2108607 Interestingly, we weren't successful<br />with the stunt people...
2108774 2115364 ...but when Willem Dafoe showed up<br />and started to define the character...
2115531 2121453 ...they stuck him on the machine,<br />and within 15 minutes of riding...
2121620 2127459 ...he didn't put new moves in,<br />he's just reacting to the machine...
2127626 2133257 ...he managed to come up with<br />these terrific moves for the Goblin.
2133424 2138137 I don't know how you feel about it,<br />Anthony, but for me...
2138304 2142224 ...when I saw him on the machine,<br />I was encouraged...
2142391 2147021 ...as to how well the character<br />was going to work on the glider.
2147187 2150190 That was the first experience...
2150357 2153986 ...of seeing the actor<br />define the character for us...
2154194 2157031 - ...to bring to the screen.<br />- Go ahead.
2157197 2161493 This sequence is interesting<br />for color correction...
2161660 2166415 ...because their skin tones<br />were so different.
2166582 2170502 Ben had a more ruddy,<br />reddish complexion.
2170669 2176175 Tobey leaned toward olive tones and<br />went green, if you weren't careful.
2176967 2181513 Especially in two-shots, where they're<br />together. This was tricky.
2184850 2187519 I remember when Willem came in.
2187686 2192232 The pumpkin bombs<br />pop out of the glider...
2192399 2197780 ...and when he had his mask on,<br />he couldn't see where they came from.
2197988 2203202 He had to learn how to catch the bombs<br />just by feel...
2203369 2206246 ...or having his hand<br />in the right place.
2206830 2212419 He ended up doing the work<br />that a stuntman would normally do.
2213587 2219301 He dedicated himself to creating<br />body-language personality for Goblin.
2219510 2225682 He was so studious in terms<br />of his positions in every situation...
2225849 2229853 ...as to whether or not it was<br />appropriate for the Goblin.
2234108 2238821 A lot of effects guys tried to go in<br />and be extras in the movie.
2239029 2242408 One guy, Jeff Wolverton,<br />made it into this match...
2242574 2245077 ...holding a Bone Saw sign.
2245411 2249998 - Is that him in the bikini?<br />- Yeah, that's him on the left.
2252793 2258132 I haven't spotted him, but I'm going<br />to go frame-by-frame on the DVD.
2260926 2263345 It's the guy trying to pitch a film.
2263512 2268183 The thing I didn't realize the first<br />couple times I saw this movie...
2268350 2272438 ...is that it's Bruce Campbell<br />in a cameo as the announcer.
2272604 2277943 Bruce is the hero from Sam's movies.
2278152 2281280 And you're participating<br />under your own free will?
2281447 2285492 Down the hall to the ramp.<br />May God be with you. Next.
2288370 2293750 Here's a case where it's<br />a reverse of the norm.
2293959 2299506 Usually, they couldn't do what<br />they needed to do with a stuntman...
2299673 2301884 ...so we did it digitally.
2302050 2304136 In this sequence...
2304303 2310267 ...they did most everything<br />with the actor or a stuntman.
2310476 2314271 Wouldn't you like to have<br />done Bone Saw CG, though?
2314438 2316064 That would've been fun.
2316231 2319818 $3000 will be paid to...
2320736 2323739 - What's your name, kid?<br />- The Human Spider.
2324323 2326700 That's it? That's the best you got?
2326867 2328994 - Yeah.<br />- Oh, that sucks.
2329161 2333665 The sum of $3000 will be paid to...
2333832 2336293 ...the terrifying, the deadly...
2336460 2339630 There's some web work<br />coming up in this sequence...
2339796 2343008 ...and it's more of an<br />elastic-type web.
2343175 2346470 Anthony mentioned<br />the different characteristics.
2346637 2349723 In this sequence, Tobey uses...
2349973 2355187 ...that web as just a very springy<br />substance to help him do some flips.
2355395 2357356 Almost like bungee cord.
2358899 2365072 This is another place, although<br />they did this actual work on-stage...
2365239 2371078 ...this is another case where<br />the Cirque du Soleil performers...
2371245 2373539 ...or performances were used.
2373705 2379044 The idea of the multiple webs<br />sort of like some of the stuff...
2379253 2385259 ...that they do on multiple bungee<br />cords in Cirque du Soleil performances.
2385467 2386677 Cage!
2388845 2391807 There were some speed up<br />of some shots in here too.
2391974 2395727 Some skip-framing,<br />or different software sometimes...
2395894 2399565 ...to speed it up and make it<br />look a little smoother.
2399773 2403485 ...Please lock<br />the cage doors at this time.
2404194 2408490 This is some kind of mistake.<br />I didn't sign up for a cage match!
2409658 2412160 Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!
2412369 2414162 Hey, freak show!
2414371 2416999 You're going nowhere.
2417165 2419543 I got you for three minutes.
2419710 2422004 Three minutes of playtime.
2426592 2429678 When we did tests<br />of our homemade costume...
2429886 2433348 ...we used some of this photography...
2433557 2437102 ...to check how our CG version<br />costume would light.
2437311 2440397 We really liked the dramatic<br />lighting here.
2440606 2445027 And it made for a good color<br />comparison kind of check.
2450741 2452284 Smash him!
2454119 2455996 One of the things that...
2457664 2463003 Back to this Green Goblin thing<br />we were talking about before...
2463211 2466590 One thing we did to make<br />the Green Goblin feel...
2466798 2469593 ...as if he were a<br />contemporary character...
2469801 2473138 ...is the motions of him<br />on his glider.
2473347 2477851 Rather than looking like he's<br />standing on top of a small airplane...
2478060 2480479 ...and flying straight and level...
2480687 2483982 ...we gave him the sense of motion<br />you get...
2484191 2488487 ...from skateboarding and<br />surfing and snowboarding.
2488654 2493158 That kind of finesse that the<br />characters have in movement...
2493325 2499289 ...you see in sports to bring this<br />into a contemporary vein as well.
2499456 2503710 Yeah, the Goblin's glider<br />is sort of like his pet.
2503877 2509216 Some kind of pet<br />that he can call at will...
2509383 2514805 ...and watches out for him,<br />and comes back to him.
2514971 2519267 We had to give the feeling<br />like he controlled it...
2519434 2524356 ...not completely by body movement.<br />A thought process was going on...
2524523 2530987 ...as if he had to just lean and it<br />knew where to go, as opposed to...
2531196 2534199 ...just pushing it around by leaning.
2534366 2539287 It was partially the understanding<br />of the Goblin and him as one.
2539454 2542457 - What the hell...?<br />- Put the money in the bag.
2544292 2545627 Hurry UP!
2551967 2554052 Hey! He stole the gate!
2554219 2556179 Stop that guy!
2556471 2559015 Stop him! He's got my money!
2559182 2563186 I like this costume.<br />It had interesting detail work...
2563353 2565647 ...when we made our CG version.
2565814 2569025 One of the first things we did<br />were the shoes...
2569192 2572112 ...which you don't really see here.
2572279 2577159 But he had these red Nike sneakers<br />we sort of did on a turntable...
2577325 2580495 ...flying around a screen<br />to try to balance...
2580662 2584458 ...how the colors and lighting<br />looked on it.
2584624 2587627 The interesting thing about<br />a movie like this...
2587794 2591882 ...because it took two years,<br />we had to make promises...
2592048 2597554 ...we weren't certain that we could<br />fulfill at the beginning of this film.
2597721 2601391 As any film of this scope,<br />it's a living document.
2601558 2604978 It has to be able to change<br />over the course of time.
2605145 2608982 The homemade costume<br />was something...
2609149 2611860 ...that evolved over the course<br />of time.
2612027 2615655 The homemade costume wasn't<br />in the first script...
2615822 2619242 ...certainly not as it ended up<br />being in the film.
2620202 2623497 And this is something<br />that we had to embrace.
2623705 2627125 It was different than<br />our hero character costume:
2627292 2631630 It's baggy and floppy and has folds<br />and the wind affects it.
2631797 2634132 So it was actually more challenging...
2634299 2638678 ...than the more polished,<br />finished version of Spider-Man.
2638845 2642641 Definitely. We had to build<br />an extra layer, basically...
2642808 2646937 ...on top of our slick costume<br />and do a cloth simulation.
2647103 2650565 John Lee did that and had to add in...
2650774 2654694 ...all the effects where he's flying<br />and get those ripples...
2654903 2657739 ...and the Wind's amplitude<br />and frequency...
2657906 2660367 ...to just give him a sense of motion.
2663328 2666665 Multilayers of wrinkles,<br />wrinkling in there.
2666832 2671586 You can see on this sweatshirt<br />how many wrinkles and folds there are.
2671753 2675006 This is a little thicker<br />than our costume...
2675173 2679010 ...but those kind of details<br />really give it realism.
2679177 2683765 The guys who did the cloth came up<br />with a garment workers' stamp...
2683932 2688061 - ...they put on dailies.<br />- Migrant textile workers of Imageworks.
2688228 2691731 An interesting thing about<br />this cloth:
2691898 2697487 When you make these costumes, you<br />end up using the same techniques...
2697654 2699573 ...real patternmakers use.
2699739 2705328 So this cloth you see here was<br />fitted to the body of the character.
2705495 2711877 If it doesn't fit right in the chest,<br />it might come back and take a pleat.
2712043 2713962 We re-tailor it, basically.
2714129 2718133 And it's actually tailoring<br />the way a real tailor works.
2718300 2721469 That wall crawl is a great shot<br />by Spencer Cook.
2721636 2725432 It shows what we came to<br />for the character's movement.
2725682 2729311 First we tried suspending<br />him from a track...
2729519 2735483 ...and let him crawl along the surface,<br />A stuntman or Tobey.
2735650 2740322 But there's no way you can<br />get the correct weight distribution.
2740488 2744034 You lift one hand,<br />they've got two feet and one arm...
2744200 2747954 ...the way that pulls on the body,<br />it didn't look right.
2748163 2751416 Here's the shot<br />when he just misses the wall.
2751583 2753293 The camera follows him.
2753460 2756212 In one of those shots we had a bus...
2756421 2760425 ...and on top there's lettering.<br />We put "PT13" on there.
2760592 2766556 PT13 was just one of our first building<br />tests. It was an homage to that.
2766765 2771019 The thing about this fabric<br />in this sequence...
2771227 2774898 I think I heard you<br />talking about this, Anthony.
2775106 2777567 The fabric enhances<br />the sense of motion.
2777734 2781029 The idea that it's fluttering<br />helps the animators...
2781196 2783907 ...keep a sense of motion<br />in the character.
2784074 2787452 The fabric gives an impression<br />of the wind moving.
2787619 2791623 It makes the animation...<br />It complements it.
2791831 2794709 It makes you aware of<br />how much clothing...
2794876 2799381 ...is what tells you the kind<br />of movement a person is making.
2800215 2806012 There was a huge section of CG<br />buildings earlier in this sequence.
2806221 2811559 A lot of work went into it by Ken Hahn,<br />Francisco, Laurence, Dan Abrams...
2811726 2814813 ...a bunch of really great lighters.
2815021 2817232 We did a couple of things here.
2817399 2821778 One of them is this business<br />of adding New York...
2823154 2827450 ...into Los Angeles and adding<br />New York into New York.
2827617 2831955 The buildings you see in some<br />of these sequences are from L.A...
2832122 2834708 ...and some are from New York.
2834916 2838253 And there are buildings<br />that have been added...
2838420 2840964 ...so you're gonna see more of that.
2841131 2846386 Here's the first animated shot in the<br />film. This shadow across the ceiling.
2846553 2850265 - That was the very first shot.<br />- One of our first finals.
2850432 2852934 Not that one. That's a live action.
2853101 2855520 This one.
2857689 2860025 He's animated, funny enough.
2860191 2863028 The rolling bear animation.
2863194 2866489 We did quite a few different<br />versions of that.
2874539 2878043 That must have been an<br />interesting thing to animate.
2878251 2883590 Indirect animation. You animate the<br />character and then cast his shadow.
2883757 2886885 Because you've got to go<br />by silhouettes.
2887052 2892140 What looks right from one angle<br />doesn't look right from another.
2892640 2893975 <i>Stop that guy!</i>
2894809 2898229 You had a version of the character<br />you were using...
2898396 2904027 ...and he was in an impossible pose<br />to make a feasible-looking shadow.
2904194 2907280 It wasn't our final<br />physiquing on the character...
2907739 2912077 ...so his shape wasn't perfect.<br />You had to manipulate that a bit.
2917707 2922003 That was some of Koji's<br />earliest physiquing there.
2922170 2924756 Part of an eight-month process.
2924923 2929636 "Physiquing" being the creation<br />of the model of the character.
2929803 2935517 Actually, the Goblin and Spider-Man<br />were set up by two different people...
2935725 2939020 ...and set up in different ways.
2939687 2945443 Koji's version, Koji Morihiro,<br />set up Spider-Man.
2945610 2950031 He approaches it differently...
2950198 2954661 ...than JJ Blumenkrantz<br />did on Goblin.
2955370 2959541 One of our guys, Alberto,<br />helped set up the Goblin system...
2959707 2965213 ...which was based on an underlying<br />skeleton and muscle system.
2965380 2971553 The Goblin also had, in addition<br />to having a skin over Willem's skin...
2971719 2976683 ...it had a hard exoskeleton<br />that had a little bit of flux in it...
2976850 2979102 ...but basically, like, slid...
2979269 2983940 ...slid up and down<br />his arms and his chest.
2984107 2988528 So it had to be a different technique<br />than our Spider-Man.
2988695 2993533 The definition of the physical form<br />of the peoples' bodies...
2993700 2996286 ...also included a muscle system.
2996452 3000415 So when they flexed,<br />you could see a change displacement...
3000582 3003376 ...in the forms of their body.
3003543 3007547 The legs, the contours of their thighs<br />and chests and arms.
3007714 3012886 There was also breathing. Anthony had<br />access to breathing controls.
3013094 3017265 Those are the kinds of subtle details<br />that tell the audience...
3017432 3022854 ...that this is a live character,<br />as opposed to a CG simulation.
3023062 3026274 A lot of that work was based on<br />reference footage...
3026482 3030028 ...we took of the actors and stunt<br />doubles at the start.
3030195 3033781 We put them through calisthenics<br />and range-of-motion tests...
3033948 3039120 ...and basically took up days of their<br />time to get all of that set up work.
3039287 3043750 But it paid off. I mean, just having<br />video reference...
3043958 3047712 ...of how the quads flex,<br />and the deltoids and biceps.
3047879 3052175 All through the body,<br />how muscles distort their volumes.
3052342 3055428 It was really useful.
3056137 3061100 And it had to be there because when<br />he's in that custom-made costume...
3061309 3066314 ...that's the only real feeling you get<br />of this character being alive.
3066481 3070360 Because the suit is tight,<br />there's no clothing to flow...
3070526 3073488 ...and give the sense<br />of movement.
3073696 3080203 So it's more difficult to bring<br />the character to life in that costume.
3083373 3087752 I keep thinking of that shot<br />in the fire building later...
3087919 3091130 ...where Spencer animated him landing.
3091297 3096886 It's just such a nice, subtle flex<br />in his quads on his legs as he lands.
3097053 3103059 It didn't make the out, but it gave a<br />sense of the weight of the landing.
3103434 3108022 When we first started doing the work<br />on this movie...
3108231 3111442 ...we did a test as a proof of concept.
3111609 3116614 And we used a model of a body that<br />came from another environment.
3116781 3121411 It wasn't the real character, but we<br />put a Spider-Man costume on him...
3121577 3127292 ...and had him climb up the side<br />of a set piece, a piece of set wall.
3127458 3132130 And when we did the test, we shot<br />the set wall with a camera move...
3132297 3135049 ...with a stuntman crawling<br />on his belly...
3135216 3139095 ...using a rig we'd designed<br />to let him slide on the surface.
3139262 3142265 The mechanical effects guys<br />put that together.
3142432 3146269 Then we shot the same camera move<br />without the character.
3148479 3153067 Then we took the version of the wall<br />without the character on it...
3153234 3159741 ...and created a CGI version using<br />this existing model of this person.
3159907 3163536 Then Anthony and the guys...<br />Did Spencer animate that?
3163703 3165538 - That first test?<br />- Yeah.
3165705 3169917 Anyway, so we took this in<br />and showed it to them.
3170084 3174005 I don't know who the lighters were.<br />It was our first...
3174172 3176924 That was a long time ago.
3177091 3181804 - I think Greg Anderson was involved.<br />- So we gave it our best shot.
3181971 3186142 This was before we'd worked out<br />how we were going to do this.
3186309 3191230 We took it in, and the producer,<br />sort of as a tongue-in-cheek joke...
3191397 3196402 ...told the executives<br />who were watching the film:
3196569 3199405 "So here's Tobey<br />climbing up the wall."
3199572 3202784 And they ran film.<br />The executives watched it.
3202950 3205828 The lights come up,<br />and they smile and say:
3205995 3211042 "It's great-looking, but that couldn't<br />have been Tobey. It's a stuntman."
3212043 3218049 So they had mistaken the animated,<br />computer-generated character...
3218216 3220968 ...that animators had put<br />on the wall...
3221135 3226933 ...and that SPI had lit and composited,<br />for a real image.
3227100 3233564 So we knew we had a shot at being<br />successful when they decided...
3233731 3238069 ...our first test was indistinguishable<br />from a real human being.
3238236 3240530 You look back on those tests now...
3240696 3245576 ...and Spider-Man looks nothing like<br />he does now in terms of his costume...
3245910 3249664 ...and even some<br />of his body language.
3250039 3253334 On every movie we do a test on,<br />you look back...
3253501 3257505 ...and that test looks so different<br />than the final product.
3257672 3260591 We were trying to arrive<br />in these tests...
3260758 3264971 ...at the proper movement for him<br />to be a mix of man and spider.
3265138 3271394 That anecdote of Laura Ziskin<br />watching the screening and saying:
3271561 3276315 "Wow. You know, this character<br />looks like a man...
3276482 3278901 ...but, well, like a spider."
3279068 3282113 Everybody said:<br />"That's exactly what it is."
3282280 3287577 And then we knew we had more or less<br />what we needed to sell this character.
3287743 3292790 A couple of shots ago, the camera<br />swinging through the city, shot in L.A.
3292957 3297378 That was where a couple of us<br />got a cameo. We were in on Sunday.
3297545 3300756 On the street corner.<br />And Sam's there waving.
3300923 3303968 And Bob, the editor, and you and I.
3304135 3306762 But you'd never find it on the DVD.
3306929 3312310 In trying to give this the feeling of<br />a camera flying through the street...
3312477 3316439 ...there were amplitude<br />and frequency controls...
3316647 3320526 ...so as the camera accelerated<br />into the skyscrapers...
3320693 3325573 ...into these canyons,<br />the camera would shake...
3325740 3329202 ...as if it were being shaken<br />by wind buffeting.
3329410 3332747 As it came up, it would slow<br />down and steady out...
3332914 3337001 ...and then hang in the air<br />to give the feeling of an operator...
3337210 3340588 ...following along with Spider-Man.
3340796 3344008 <i>But we should all just give him<br />One big hug</i>
3344175 3350932 On this montage sequence they cut in<br />some of our very early shots...
3351140 3356395 ...from the original teaser trailers<br />and in the early trailers.
3356562 3361484 If we tried to follow along with<br />the character, that didn't work.
3361651 3366155 You had to let him go away,<br />then come back to the camera.
3366364 3369158 And let the character work the frame...
3369325 3372328 ...while depending on<br />where he was headed.
3372495 3378584 Work it from bottom left<br />to upper right, or opposite.
3378793 3382630 Give this feeling of an operator<br />behind this camera...
3382838 3385132 ...following this digital actor.
3385299 3386634 What's he got to hide?
3386801 3389845 She needs to know<br />if you want chintz or chenille.
3390012 3392473 - Whichever's cheaper.<br />- It's like this.
3392640 3395601 We double-booked page six.<br />Macy's and Conway's both have...
3395768 3401148 I was trying to figure out what was on<br />that TV. What movie we're showing...
3401357 3404986 They switched there,<br />but it was some old horror film.
3405194 3407029 Some monster, big monster.
3407196 3409824 Sam loves sneaking little things in.
3409991 3412868 He would never give away<br />his secrets.
3413035 3416622 I'm sure you have to watch it<br />many times to find that.
3416789 3420167 Some creature coming out of the water.
3420334 3424547 Aren't those, like, oil-spill victims?
3425756 3429218 He doesn't want to be famous?<br />I'll make him infamous!
3429385 3433472 The interior of that office<br />existed in three places.
3433639 3436392 It was built on the stage once...
3436559 3440938 ...then it was photographed<br />in a location in downtown L.A.
3441147 3446694 Then it was rebuilt in another piece<br />shot yet again on a separate stage.
3446861 3450781 That sets up the interesting<br />problem that there was...
3450948 3456203 ...after Goblin comes crashing through<br />into Jameson's office...
3456412 3460750 ...and then Spider-Man comes down<br />outside the window...
3460916 3464170 ...and the Goblin knocks him out.
3464378 3467214 When he falls down<br />the side of the building...
3467423 3470593 Because of the lights<br />for the shots to match...
3470760 3475014 ...we had to do a matte painting<br />of the building, right?
3475181 3477475 I'm talking to you! Hey!
3477683 3479977 Yes, Enrique, okay? I get you!
3480144 3484273 It better not happen no more.<br />Don't roll your eyes at me.
3484440 3488194 The process is interesting.<br />You shoot all this material...
3488361 3490780 ...and they edit the thing together.
3490946 3494909 There's times when complete<br />sequences get left out.
3495117 3498037 And you end up with a sequence shot...
3498496 3502416 ...for a particular time of day<br />used at a different time.
3502583 3508005 Or a shot even where a shot that was<br />made with the sun in one direction...
3508214 3512760 ...cut with the sun in another<br />direction, or perhaps the sun gone.
3512927 3517598 Those are things now, although they've<br />always been a part of it...
3517765 3520893 ...those are things now<br />that we are using...
3521060 3524689 ...digital color timing and techniques<br />to smooth out...
3524855 3530111 ...so they don't create as big<br />a disconnect for the audience.
3530319 3534949 The trick is to get people<br />to not be aware of being in a theatre.
3535116 3539161 The one thing we would never do<br />though, is flip a shot.
3540996 3543082 Are you being facetious?
3543290 3548462 You're still sensitive about<br />your Times Square shot they flipped.
3548629 3552174 The whole process,<br />every studio, every group...
3552341 3557138 ...every visual effects house<br />has a different approach...
3557304 3562017 ...to how they're going<br />to work together.
3562184 3566188 Even within a certain house,<br />you'll find that every group...
3566355 3571527 ...certainly every effects designer, is<br />gonna have a different way of working.
3571694 3577533 On this, we were all together.<br />All departments saw dailies together.
3577700 3581829 And I think that was healthy<br />because everybody contributes.
3581996 3588085 It may hurt to hear what they have<br />to say, but it usually makes it better.
3588252 3591005 We would separate animation dailies...
3591172 3596677 ...where we were blocking out the shots<br />with lighting and compositing dailies.
3597094 3603517 John, Anthony and I, and some<br />supervisors would sit in all of them.
3603726 3605436 Peter Parker.
3605770 3607855 Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
3608022 3611442 It's interesting,<br />we've had stuff to say...
3611650 3615154 ...about the first part,<br />but it hasn't been intense.
3615321 3620034 I guess it's the same kind<br />of distribution a lot of films have.
3620201 3624872 But there was an effort in this to<br />focus on the people at the beginning...
3625039 3628417 ...to establish these characters<br />and create empathy...
3628626 3635132 ...before we got too carried away<br />with the visual theatrics.
3635841 3639804 If it ended now, you wouldn't<br />call it an effects film.
3640012 3641305 It would just be...
3641472 3645810 No, and I'd still be wondering what<br />happened at the beginning.
3645976 3648020 ...About photography.
3650356 3651607 Hello.
3653526 3654610 Let's go!
3654777 3658697 This was interesting.<br />This was a fascinating sequence.
3661408 3664995 It became evident that the character...
3665162 3669750 ...in this custom-made costume,<br />when he would be animated...
3669959 3674839 ...the best explanation we could<br />come up with was that as light...
3675047 3679260 ...arced across his skin, backlight,<br />it caused him to speed up.
3679426 3684598 So we went through several speed<br />changes in that sequence.
3684765 3686559 It's funny.
3686725 3690479 All three of us have seen this<br />several times now.
3690688 3693440 But shots like those<br />you're talking about...
3693607 3696861 ...we've seen hundreds<br />and hundreds of times.
3697069 3701031 We see them at artists' workstations<br />when they're first being made.
3701240 3707663 We see them in dailies on a loop,<br />maybe 30, 40 times a day.
3707872 3711834 Then we see them on film,<br />just looped over and over again.
3712001 3715504 So we've seen this film many,<br />many times over.
3717172 3721010 The little shot where Spider-Man's<br />on the ground...
3721176 3724638 ...and he's kicking the bank robber...
3724805 3728559 ...and then flips over the top of him.
3728767 3733856 We went through so many different<br />versions of this because...
3734023 3738611 ...as in a lot of shots, some shots<br />we'll see later, it's the same thing.
3738777 3741280 This character is a superhuman...
3741447 3745910 ...but we still wanted him<br />to be a thinking character.
3746076 3750623 So if everything's too<br />well-choreographed...
3750789 3753250 ...it can have a false look to it.
3753667 3757630 As if the character weren't thinking<br />on his feet at that moment.
3757796 3763594 It can look scripted, as it were.<br />Contrived.
3769725 3774063 Interesting thing about this character,<br />something Sam said consistently:
3774229 3776732 "I want to know what he's thinking."
3776899 3780319 When you have a character<br />who has a face...
3780486 3784698 ...the idea of establishing<br />his thoughts is much easier...
3784865 3789995 ...than with a character who is only<br />using his body because he's masked.
3790162 3793666 That's the interesting thing<br />about animation in this film.
3793874 3798170 From my point of view, you have<br />a sense of what he's thinking...
3798337 3801840 ...just based on the way<br />his body's moving.
3802007 3808055 The actors actually dealt with the<br />same issues as our animators.
3808263 3811225 Acting with the body<br />instead of the face.
3811392 3815479 We both kind of had to come<br />to our solutions separately.
3816063 3818023 You can't do this to me.
3821193 3823487 I started this company.
3824530 3826949 You know how much I sacrificed?!
3828158 3832621 Here's Willem Dafoe<br />in his psycho routine again.
3834581 3838335 No effects used to enhance his<br />expressions there.
3841964 3846051 The character's physicality is part of<br />what made the Goblin successful.
3846218 3851682 Not only in the virtual character,<br />but in the actor himself.
3851849 3858313 He's never static. There's always<br />something going on with him.
3858897 3861483 I know it's an acting issue...
3861650 3864570 ...but Tobey's very quiet as an actor.
3864737 3866864 He moves his body much less.
3867031 3871702 All those board members we just saw<br />we had to make digital versions of...
3871869 3875205 ...to mess with later in this<br />Times Square sequence.
3875414 3880002 This was one of the first sequences<br />we got live-action photography on.
3880169 3882129 It was the first sequence.
3882296 3884715 This is where we cut our teeth.
3884882 3888677 This is where we worked out<br />how we'd achieve these events.
3888844 3891764 This is exciting.<br />I animated that balloon.
3891930 3894641 That was Anthony's personal animation.
3894808 3898562 What did that take,<br />three or four weeks to do, Anthony?
3899396 3902441 That was the first time.<br />We did it again.
3902608 3907321 The tough thing about this sequence<br />is it's a daylight exterior.
3907488 3911658 Without getting into specifics,<br />this was shot in New York.
3911825 3917039 Portions of it were shot in New York,<br />portions of it were shot on a stage.
3917247 3922836 Portions of it were shot in Downey,<br />portions were computer-generated.
3923003 3926882 It's not necessarily<br />the same piece all the time.
3927049 3929927 When you watch the sequence<br />you can see...
3930094 3934056 ...that we had to create everything<br />from very small-scale...
3934223 3941105 ...to very large-scale components<br />to make this sequence complete.
3941355 3946276 There's no other way we could do it,<br />aside from shutting down Times Square.
3946443 3949780 They talked to us...<br />We talked to them, excuse me.
3949947 3954660 We talked to them about shutting down<br />Times Square for the weekend.
3954868 3956912 They weren't going for it.
3957871 3961542 The animation on the balloons<br />in there is dynamics...
3961708 3965045 ...which is a method of...
3965254 3969174 ...how the energy would flow<br />through an object...
3969383 3973512 ...if it were animated<br />or hit with energy.
3973679 3979768 So in this case, the balloons<br />are hit with air, or an object.
3979977 3985357 Dan Kramer did a nice job making these<br />balloons look natural for their size...
3985524 3987651 ...and the way it would move.
3987943 3991780 The balloons helped tie<br />different environments together.
3991947 3995576 They gave good foreground objects<br />and bridged the gap...
3995742 3998370 ...between the different photography.
3999788 4006253 We have our somewhat controversial<br />sign replacements in this sequence.
4007004 4010799 One thing the balloon did,<br />in foreground and middle ground...
4011008 4015762 If you look at Times Square,<br />we were on Dick Clark's balcony...
4015971 4019808 ...the one he stands on<br />during the New Year's celebration.
4020017 4022686 Then the people were below us.
4022895 4026481 If you stand and look down,<br />everything's in the distance.
4026690 4030068 You don't have much of a sense<br />of perspective or scale.
4030694 4035782 Putting the balloons into the sequence<br />gave us some middle-ground elements...
4035949 4040954 ...which allowed us to show not only<br />the scale of the environment...
4041121 4044166 ...but also to keep the screen<br />alive with movement.
4044333 4048420 Because as the camera moves,<br />you can see that the balloons...
4048629 4051215 ...give a sense of foreground<br />and background...
4051423 4054801 ...which you wouldn't have<br />if it wasn't for them.
4054968 4059681 These are a series of multi-purpose<br />pumpkin bombs.
4063477 4064895 Another CG creation.
4065062 4069691 I'm sure everybody noticed a couple of<br />minutes ago the Stan Lee cameos.
4069900 4074905 Originally he was selling<br />sunglasses at a stand.
4075113 4077783 He had a couple funny lines,<br />but they got cut.
4077950 4082371 One of his lines was,<br />"Yeah, they use these in X-Men."
4083538 4087125 - There's your cameo.<br />- I ran by in front of the kid.
4087292 4091964 Shot at the very end of production.
4092172 4096969 There was a case of the glider<br />coming back to the Goblin...
4097177 4102766 ...waiting on him for when he needs<br />to jump back on, like a cowboy's horse.
4105269 4110315 A lot of these ground shots of Goblin<br />we used as lighting reference...
4110524 4114653 ...when we were developing our Goblin<br />CG model, and its lighting model.
4114820 4116154 There he is.
4116321 4120075 This was shot by<br />Pedram Goshtasbpour...
4121827 4126498 It cuts together with live action,<br />goes back and forth between the two.
4129126 4132170 Watch Goblin spin out.
4133505 4137301 - He stalled.<br />- Kicking off a wave on a surfboard.
4140470 4146810 Interestingly, the people in the street<br />are made of digital characters...
4147019 4148979 ...generated in the computer...
4149187 4151606 ...people from Downey,<br />who were shot...
4151815 4154693 I think we had 5000 people one day.
4154901 4158322 Another day we had 1000,<br />then it got down to 250.
4158488 4160032 People got tired of coming.
4160240 4163869 And the crowds in the streets<br />are all made up...
4165579 4169541 ...of separate pieces<br />that are all sewn together...
4169750 4175797 ...to create much more scope<br />than we actually had to photograph.
4175964 4180719 This is Peter Nofz's sequence,<br />as a CG supervisor.
4180886 4185682 He coordinated the set up of a bunch<br />of these different systems...
4185891 4189311 ...including our crowd system<br />and the character setup.
4189519 4191813 He got a taste of every pipeline.
4191980 4195776 Our building pipeline,<br />our painted tile pipeline.
4195942 4200364 We stitched together photography<br />that John shot in New York.
4200530 4201698 It came together.
4201865 4208622 Just for the sense of description,<br />when Scott talks about a pipeline...
4208789 4215003 ...it's the process characters and<br />environments go through to be finished.
4215170 4219508 Once principle photography is done,<br />if that's a component of a shot...
4219674 4224137 ...let's say a background plate,<br />in the case of this New York piece...
4224304 4227474 ...then all of the pieces<br />begin to come together.
4227641 4232521 Those pieces may take five weeks<br />to assemble, or a week to assemble.
4232687 4235732 We call the length of time<br />that it takes...
4235941 4241613 ...to go from the beginning components<br />to its completion a "pipeline."
4241822 4246910 In some cases the pipeline<br />is tied to a character.
4247077 4250789 In other cases, it's tied<br />to the complexity of the shot.
4250956 4255836 The last shot in the movie<br />took six months, I believe.
4256002 4260674 - Yeah, six to eight months.<br />- That's not a pure pipeline...
4260841 4264428 ...but it gives you a sense<br />of how long it takes.
4264594 4270100 We had to decide what we were actually<br />going to do fairly early on...
4270267 4275230 ...to get the shots done by the time<br />the film was in the theatres.
4278900 4282195 By the time we got<br />into really finishing...
4282362 4285740 ...or getting close to finishing<br />the last swing shot...
4285907 4289286 ...everybody wanted to do<br />more shots like it.
4289453 4293582 We just knew we didn't have the time<br />in the schedule to do more.
4293748 4295542 Well, you use every moment.
4295709 4298795 I have yet to work on a movie<br />where we said:
4298962 4301465 "We're done. We'll take the week off."
4301673 4306928 You always work until,<br />as Sam said for this movie...
4307095 4310682 ...I believe he's quoting someone<br />else but he says:
4310891 4314603 "They will pry the film<br />from his cold, dead hands."
4314853 4318690 That's pretty much the way<br />these movies always are.
4318857 4324613 The whole process,<br />from script to storyboard artists...
4324779 4327115 ...to Sam, and then over to us...
4327282 4332037 ...then going through you, John,<br />then filtering through other people.
4332204 4337667 Going from me to the animators, and<br />then back in the other direction again.
4337834 4341046 It goes back and forth<br />through this hierarchy...
4341213 4345675 ...and you arrive at something<br />until Sam finally agrees upon it.
4345842 4349513 But everybody has their input<br />into these things.
4349679 4353808 And different people input<br />on many different things.
4353975 4357020 The lighter can comment<br />about the animation.
4357229 4361775 An animator might comment<br />about the lighting.
4362317 4363777 It works a little...
4363944 4367072 - Is that a sore spot?<br />- No. Not at all.
4367239 4372452 Anthony and I always argue<br />a little bit in jest, in dailies.
4372619 4376790 - But we won't do that now.<br />- Oh, I'll miss it.
4376998 4381878 I was gonna say, the pre-visualization<br />that Anthony was talking about...
4382045 4387425 ...it's different for live-action shots<br />and an all-CG shot.
4387592 4392931 For live-action photography,<br />a lot of it was used to hash out...
4393098 4397894 ...where the camera should be<br />and what lens would be used...
4398061 4401398 ...and to block out<br />for the day of the shooting.
4401565 4407946 In the case of all-CG shots,<br />it was actually much easier, in a way.
4408113 4412492 The animators were really blocking out<br />the shot in that case.
4412659 4417122 It just went from pre-vis<br />to finishing animation stages...
4417289 4423211 ...straight into lighting without a<br />photography section in that path.
4423378 4426131 We talked about pre-visualization...
4426506 4430510 ...which is the geometry of a set<br />or a location...
4430677 4433680 ...and simple geometry<br />of the characters...
4433847 4438184 ...with a virtual camera that can be<br />positioned to create shots.
4438351 4443982 We did pre-visualization on shots that<br />were live-action pieces, as well...
4444149 4448320 ...so that when we showed up on-stage<br />to do the photography...
4448486 4452449 ...we could tell the director of<br />photography the focal lengths...
4452616 4456745 ...and the distance from the camera<br />to the subject.
4456911 4463001 That was a place to begin.<br />Pre-visualization isn't cast in stone.
4463209 4466504 It's always, again, a living document.
4466713 4469716 But it gave everyone<br />an exhibit to work with...
4470258 4473803 ...to determine the needs of a shot<br />on a given day.
4473970 4478975 It makes you more efficient.<br />You put more of your money on screen...
4479184 4484564 ...instead of putting the money into<br />doing fix-its or changing your mind.
4484773 4486775 Pre-visualization was good.
4486941 4492906 John Schmidt was great about working<br />out those things for shoot days.
4493114 4495867 He also made printouts for them.
4496076 4500330 He went through a ream of paper<br />making printouts used for shooting.
4500497 4503625 Here comes the Goblin.
4507504 4511383 We worked with the mechanical guys<br />and the stunts guys.
4511549 4515095 In many cases, the Goblin was there<br />on a practical glider.
4515553 4521059 Sometimes it was Willem on the glider,<br />sometimes it was a stuntperson.
4521559 4524896 We had to communicate<br />on an ongoing basis.
4525313 4530360 We used the pre-visualization as the<br />exhibit that we discussed together.
4530527 4535031 It allowed us to bring the proper tools<br />for the day's photography...
4535198 4539703 ...as well as the postproduction work<br />that had to be done in visual effects.
4540245 4542455 Another shot by Koji Morihiro...
4542622 4548545 ...the guy who actually made the set up<br />for Spider-Man animation.
4548712 4550630 Jeff Stern lit that shot.
4550797 4554884 When I saw that lighting,<br />it was such a nice golden-hour look.
4555051 4558638 It influenced how we ended up<br />on that sequence.
4558805 4562142 This is a great sequence<br />to get a feeling...
4562308 4566438 ...for the psychotic behavior<br />that Goblin has...
4566604 4568732 ...and what I looked to...
4568898 4573778 ...to give different facets of<br />his behavior in the performance.
4573987 4576865 Well, to each his own.
4577031 4579993 I chose my path,<br />you chose the way of the hero.
4584539 4588209 This was also the sequence<br />shot on-stage...
4588376 4593506 ...and we decided that the backing<br />didn't have the right contrast level.
4593673 4598052 As a post process, we did some<br />adjustments on the background.
4598219 4600096 Put some steam in.
4600305 4604184 The other interesting thing,<br />because of dialogue changes...
4604350 4608438 ...we obscured the Goblin's mouth<br />in some of these shots...
4608605 4611775 ...so the lip-synch wouldn't be off.
4612358 4615820 We did a lot of editorial tinkering<br />with this shot...
4615987 4619866 ...during the process of making it.
4621117 4625997 We went through a lot of different<br />versions of his performance in this.
4626164 4630126 When the glider comes in,<br />he jumps on it and flies away.
4630293 4635256 In his speech, we tried to get across<br />in his body what Sam wanted him to say.
4635423 4637592 We had different versions.
4637759 4641846 One time, we were repeating<br />what he was doing to his head.
4642388 4647811 There's something coming up where<br />he puts his fingers to his head.
4647977 4649729 Well, that's cut out.
4649896 4656110 But he flies away, and gives<br />this Shakespearean gesture to him.
4661157 4666246 For characters, the actors,<br />Willem Dafoe and Tobey Maguire...
4666412 4669582 ...one who's very still,<br />one who's animated...
4669749 4673169 ...once we put the costumes on...
4673336 4679259 ...the somewhat melodramatic motions<br />become totally acceptable.
4679467 4685056 You don't balk at them, because they<br />replace the business of the guy's face.
4685223 4689811 It's very interesting that some of the<br />motions and positions...
4690019 4694732 ...that the characters get into<br />when they're masked seem extreme...
4694899 4698611 ...but don't seem extreme<br />in the context of the story.
4698778 4700280 So how'd it go?
4702448 4704450 They said I needed acting lessons.
4704701 4707328 A soap opera told me<br />I needed acting lessons.
4707537 4712792 There's a lot of little wire removal<br />and some composite shots...
4713001 4716379 ...Imageworks didn't do.<br />We worked with vendors.
4716629 4720091 CIS, Post Logic, Digiscope<br />did a lot of the work...
4720300 4723011 ...coming up in the next<br />rain sequence.
4723177 4726472 What's interesting<br />about contemporary filmmaking...
4726639 4730810 ...is it used to be you couldn't<br />remove wires or posts.
4731019 4735940 So production had to be very careful<br />about what they put into a scene.
4736149 4741613 Although, I'd like to say this<br />production wasn't bad that way.
4741863 4747785 On films I've worked on, they've left<br />the food truck in the background.
4747952 4750997 Because it was quicker<br />to shoot the scene...
4751205 4754500 ...and have the truck<br />removed in postproduction.
4754751 4759714 And the whole business of wires now,<br />and posts to support people...
4759923 4766012 ...to make them fly and do other things<br />is rampant. Every other shot...
4766262 4768473 ...in action sequences...
4768681 4772644 ...often times have support rods,<br />or tubes...
4772894 4778983 ...or cranes, or people's hands, that<br />you end up going back to paint out.
4779233 4784238 It's one of the things digital imagery<br />has provided to the filmmakers.
4784405 4788409 You can take eyes from one take<br />and a mouth from another...
4788576 4792580 ...and paint them together<br />to make another shot.
4793706 4797126 Pixel Magic was our<br />other vendor, I forgot to mention.
4797293 4801089 Now it doesn't necessarily mean<br />that you should do that.
4801965 4805051 We had many<br />wire removal and fix it shots...
4805259 4810264 ...they all just blend together.<br />I can't remember where they all are.
4826030 4829200 Tobey's fighting style<br />is not martial arts.
4829409 4834330 It's a cross, as Anthony was calling<br />it, between human and superhuman.
4834539 4838960 He throws conventional boxing-type<br />punches, but he also uses...
4839210 4841504 ...almost Judo-type moves.
4841754 4846801 It's kind of an interesting mix<br />of a collage of fighting styles...
4847010 4852306 ...which, I think, gives him<br />a personality all his own.
4852515 4856310 I love the shot in that sequence<br />where he's all wet.
4856561 4861149 It's just so unmotivated if you look<br />at this shot out of context.
4861357 4864068 I felt sorry for Tobey in this shot.
4864277 4867947 Because I was there<br />when they shot it...
4868156 4874245 ...it's difficult for me to see it as<br />romantic. His sinuses were full of water.
4874412 4880043 He was breathing out of his mouth,<br />through the wet fabric.
4912658 4916245 Boy, that spider web<br />does some interesting stuff.
4916496 4919457 - You just press a button...<br />- And up you go.
4919707 4923419 In those shots, even though<br />you don't see anything...
4923669 4928841 ...we've done a little extra movement<br />around and overriding post move...
4929092 4933012 ...to just reframe or add extra<br />motion into those shots.
4933221 4937225 And there, this is kind<br />of the first of our daytime...
4937433 4940770 ...CG buildings in the<br />background of some shots.
4940937 4943856 Except for Times Square.
4944023 4948820 Nice work on the webs where they<br />waft in the wind after he goes...
4948986 4951364 ...to get back into the window.
4952698 4957370 That shot came together pretty fast<br />at the end of the show.
4958121 4961749 That was a kind of last minute<br />pull-together shot.
4973010 4978182 Okay, this fire sequence contains<br />components shot in New York.
4978391 4982812 This piece, for instance,<br />is located in New York, as is that.
4983020 4985606 Once we go inside, we're on a set...
4985815 4989443 ...that was built once<br />in a parking lot in Downey...
4989652 4994490 ...then again, to shoot subsequent<br />components of the shot...
4994657 4998286 ...in a parking lot in Culver City.
4998494 5000997 It all goes together very nicely.
5001205 5007461 This is an example of integrating this<br />character seamlessly into a scene.
5007712 5013092 I think this is a terrific shot<br />that is in this sequence...
5013301 5015011 ...which we'll point out.
5015219 5019682 It was a great transition<br />between real and digital actors.
5019891 5023853 That was a great shot by Ken Morris,<br />coming in the window.
5024061 5029400 That web, animated by Todd Boyce, was<br />a web that Sam kept coming back to...
5029650 5034155 ...as a reference of a floating web<br />where it wafted into the air.
5034363 5039160 He liked that quality. We tried<br />to get that in some other shots.
5041204 5047835 The actors were actually in this set<br />as it was on fire, wearing Lycra...
5048044 5054258 ...which is flammable. You can imagine<br />how excited they were about that.
5054467 5059388 I don't know whether Willem talked<br />about this or Tobey...
5059597 5064435 ...but it was quite hot on that set.<br />If you were gonna be on the set...
5064685 5069398 ...you wore a complete firefighters'<br />uniform, including a respirator.
5069607 5073361 This is Spencer Cook<br />in a really beautiful shot...
5073611 5078616 ...where all the elements come together<br />very well. People thought this...
5078783 5080284 ...was a real actor.
5080451 5085164 Greg Anderson did a great job lighting<br />that and Greg Derochie...
5085331 5087124 ...compositing it.
5087333 5092129 Jeff Lin doing this work,<br />Torn Gurney doing this work.
5092838 5095549 Razorbats exploding.
5095883 5099971 I thought it was a very well<br />choreographed sequence too.
5104892 5107687 No one says no to me!
5112984 5118906 I think the transitions Sam uses<br />are somewhat dated...
5119115 5123953 ...but they're interesting. It gives<br />a certain personality to the film.
5124203 5128833 The flame transitions. There's other<br />places where he's used wipes...
5129041 5132253 ...and interesting kinds<br />of fades and things.
5132503 5135923 Thank you, Mr. Osborn.<br />We're so glad you could come.
5136173 5138884 Who is this lovely young lady?
5139051 5141345 M.J., I'd like you to meet my father...
5141554 5145308 We worked on this movie<br />through the transition...
5145516 5149520 ...of the September 11th<br />disaster in New York.
5149770 5155109 I was gonna mention it earlier,<br />we didn't remove...
5156068 5160281 ...the World Trade Centre<br />from any of our shots.
5160489 5164994 The only shot that had<br />the World Trade Centre in it...
5165161 5167204 ...was the one in the trailer.
5167413 5172043 They chose to not use it because<br />the Trade Centre was featured...
5172293 5175796 ...so they felt that<br />that was too painful.
5176047 5182136 John, when you shot the footage<br />after September 11th for the top...
5182303 5186974 ...of the buildings in the last swing,<br />the Twin Towers weren't there.
5187141 5192688 To make it consistent, Dan Eaton<br />actually put those towers in there.
5192938 5195983 And this our famous blood shot.
5196192 5199320 So this was a bone of contention.
5201197 5205409 This is a shot Anthony teased me<br />about looking like ketchup.
5205659 5209830 I still, to this day,<br />don't think it looks like ketchup.
5210039 5215378 I think that the shot wouldn't have<br />worked unless it looked like ketchup.
5215961 5221717 Well, I was hoping for some kind of<br />big conflict. I guess that was quick.
5221967 5227723 I tease Scott, but it had to be thick.<br />Real blood would splatter horizontally.
5227973 5232686 Yeah, I was ready to jab Anthony<br />and get some blood experiments...
5232895 5236023 ...to really test<br />what it would look like.
5238567 5241404 Thank you.<br />Now then, everybody sit down...
5241570 5243155 ...and we can say grace.
5246700 5248452 Here we go.
5255459 5256627 There we are.
5256794 5262842 So New York City, real New York City<br />with all the bits and pieces...
5263050 5266720 We started using a technique<br />called photogrametry...
5266971 5270850 ...where we were gonna create<br />large chunks of the city...
5271058 5276939 ...based on multiple-positioned<br />camera photographs of New York.
5277189 5282570 It turned out that that technique<br />didn't provide us enough resolution.
5282820 5286490 Meaning that the buildings<br />we created that way...
5286740 5292955 ...didn't have enough detail in them<br />for the camera to get close to them.
5293164 5296292 We then decided instead<br />of doing that...
5296500 5299420 ...to use conventional...
5300337 5302756 ...surveyors' instruments...
5303007 5308095 ...to create a mathematical model<br />of buildings in much higher detail...
5308345 5314643 ...and use still photographs of the<br />surfaces of those buildings to be...
5314810 5317688 ...stretched back<br />onto that geometry.
5317938 5322985 We had the shape of the building and<br />we had a picture of the surfaces...
5323152 5327448 ...on the building. We placed<br />those surfaces onto the building.
5327615 5330284 It's called mapping.
5330534 5334997 And as you look at this...<br />As we continues through this...
5335206 5340336 ...you're gonna see extensive<br />use of this technique.
5340586 5345966 We had buildings in the middle ground,<br />foreground, and in the distance.
5346217 5352806 Some were in original photography<br />and some were added in after the fact.
5353015 5356977 The other weakness<br />photogrametry had was you tend...
5357186 5360314 ...to get the built<br />in lighting of the day...
5360523 5363484 ...so it depends on<br />how overcast it is...
5363692 5367905 ...the sun's angle, what time of day.<br />You don't have leeway.
5368113 5371992 Our buildings had to hold up<br />for different sun angles...
5372243 5374328 ...and different times of day.
5374578 5381085 So our main texture painter guy,<br />Carey, ended up taking all the photos.
5381335 5387216 They painted out a lot of detail that<br />we'd add back in later with lighting.
5387424 5390219 Also, paint the edges<br />so we could tile...
5390427 5394640 ...and reuse some of that photography<br />to extend buildings.
5394848 5399228 Talk about the tiles. That's an<br />important thing that we used.
5399478 5403607 - The tiles in terms of...<br />- Just how we did it.
5404900 5408779 We started out making<br />this whole building system.
5408988 5413409 We knew we would have complex<br />scenes that had a lot of geometry.
5413659 5416745 We made our buildings<br />as building blocks.
5416996 5421792 We used a system that Steve LeVietes<br />created in Houdini software...
5421959 5427590 ...to easily instance pieces<br />and assemble them all together.
5428215 5432094 Also there was a notion that<br />when we took these photos...
5432303 5434847 ...they had to seam up on the edges.
5435014 5439852 If you look at real buildings,<br />there's lots of variation in color...
5440060 5443105 ...and lighting across<br />these buildings.
5443314 5448110 Our texture painters had to balance<br />those out of the textures...
5448319 5453616 ...make them so they could seam up<br />together and work generically.
5453824 5458662 The beautiful thing about the<br />tiles is, you get this hemisphere...
5458912 5461165 ...which functions as a plate.
5461415 5466754 But a normal plate, you've gotta work<br />within what the camera has shot.
5466962 5471342 When you have this hemisphere<br />of tiles stitched together...
5471592 5474470 ...you can move<br />the camera all around...
5474720 5479391 ...and create your own camera move<br />within this background.
5479642 5482186 Our pan and tile system...
5482394 5487399 ...which was another technique we used<br />to put behind our CG buildings.
5487608 5492988 The camera sits in one place.<br />You take a shot and then tilt up.
5493155 5497117 Take one to the right and left,<br />until you have these...
5497284 5503666 ...photos that define or capture<br />the panorama before you.
5503916 5509755 If you look at David Hockney's art,<br />you see some of this kind of tiling.
5510005 5514718 We did it in a much more precise<br />fashion, but far less artistic.
5514927 5519139 It's a lot of single images<br />which are combined together...
5519390 5522893 ...to create a much larger image<br />at high resolution.
5523143 5528524 That allows you to move in closer<br />and further away and to pan...
5528691 5535155 ...and move up and down<br />on this big domed projection.
5535364 5540619 It's a technique that's been<br />getting more and more...
5540869 5544123 ...in use over the last couple<br />of years.
5544331 5549002 Many years ago, you'd have<br />to assemble it in 3-D and render out.
5549253 5552464 Nowadays, at Imageworks,<br />we've got a system...
5552715 5559346 ...where we do it in our last<br />compositing stage so it's much faster.
5562850 5568564 One of the interesting things about<br />visual effects in movies is that...
5568772 5575195 ...you start out with scripts that have<br />more stuff than you can afford to do.
5575404 5580409 Using resource as a definition<br />of time and money.
5580617 5585330 You always have twice the material<br />as you have the resource to do.
5585497 5589543 Throughout the creation of the film,<br />you have to go back...
5589710 5595048 ...and constantly be on top of deciding<br />where you'll put the resource.
5595299 5601472 We knew we had to create a virtual<br />version of the Spider-Man character...
5601638 5604224 ...a virtual version of the Goblin...
5604391 5607895 ...and a virtual version of<br />portions of New York...
5608061 5612524 ...to allow us to do the kinds of<br />camera moves that we wanted...
5612733 5618530 ...because they weren't allowing<br />anybody to swing through the streets.
5618697 5622993 So those were our primary<br />allocations of resource.
5623202 5628457 Then as the script developed,<br />as we worked on the movie...
5628707 5631168 ...the story became clearer to us.
5631418 5636965 We then had to re-evaluate where we<br />were putting our efforts or resource.
5637216 5642721 And one of the things that was...<br />We also knew we had to do the web.
5642930 5646350 The web was a component<br />of resource allocation.
5646600 5649561 But as we continued<br />through the process...
5649728 5653732 ...we had to re-evaluate<br />what was being put into the film.
5653899 5657986 We'd get new sequences they<br />wanted to make a story point.
5658195 5664243 Then that sequence would be evaluated,<br />then abandoned because of expense.
5664451 5668872 And that was going on<br />for the live-action stuff as well.
5669122 5672167 It requires that you be very flexible.
5672376 5677631 You have to be willing to abandon<br />a scene that you like that you've...
5677798 5682427 ...spent months developing since<br />it no longer applies in the story.
5682678 5687224 That's the hardest thing in doing<br />visual effects and filmmaking...
5687474 5690936 ...is giving away your "babies,"<br />so to speak...
5691144 5694940 ...in pursuit of a more<br />effective storytelling.
5695190 5698652 You also have to be willing to meet...
5698861 5703490 ...an impossible challenge at the last<br />moment. When we did this film...
5703740 5707619 ...it wasn't unusual<br />in the last two or three weeks...
5707870 5713250 ...for the director and editor to<br />come up with a shot that required...
5713417 5715377 ...some heroic performance.
5715586 5720507 We talked about one of the shots<br />earlier which was Spider-Man...
5720674 5724386 ...swinging through buildings<br />on his way to the fire.
5724595 5728682 That shot came out<br />through animation, lighting...
5728932 5734396 ...and compositing in record time.<br />You have to be light on your feet...
5734605 5740986 ...and willing to pursue the end<br />goal of the story, first and foremost.
5741194 5746783 Seems like on every film,<br />you always promise something...
5746992 5750621 ...that you have no idea<br />whether or not you can do.
5750787 5752039 You have to.
5752205 5756835 And that's generally how new ways<br />of doing things are created.
5757044 5760589 What's interesting<br />is that Sam's very pragmatic.
5760797 5765385 He chose, in many cases,<br />to use practical effects...
5765594 5768347 ...meaning mechanical<br />effects or stunts.
5768597 5772059 Other filmmakers I've<br />worked with have defaulted...
5772267 5774853 ...to a digital solution immediately.
5775020 5780692 He'd explore more traditional methods<br />extensively before allocating...
5780859 5786406 ...that visual effects resource<br />to a single shot or a sequence.
5786573 5792454 And I think that that shows up<br />in his understanding of this story.
5792663 5797084 He knows where he wants<br />to put the money, the resource...
5797292 5800420 ...in terms of the telling<br />of the story.
5803507 5807344 Just another note,<br />there's a sort of different class...
5807594 5811473 ...of shot that's<br />become more popular recently...
5811723 5816687 ...and that's these product placement<br />or product replacement shots.
5816895 5822109 We went through a sequence earlier<br />where he's shooting at a can.
5822317 5827155 - Of course, we replaced products.<br />- Three different kinds of cans.
5827364 5830117 We went through different<br />types of cans.
5830325 5836498 There's a critical phone call shot<br />coming up where Tobey's on the phone...
5836707 5841294 ...and it was a brand of payphone<br />nobody wanted to see in the shot.
5841545 5845257 So we had one of our<br />vendors take it out.
5845507 5851930 So there's a lot of attention to those<br />sort of details that happens nowadays.
5854975 5859688 I think people must think<br />that people will want to...
5859855 5863859 ...drink and eat the same<br />things that Spider-Man does.
5864026 5866653 - I think so.<br />- I do.
5866820 5872200 I personally eat almost every sugared<br />cereal that has his picture on it.
5872451 5876121 How do you think<br />he makes all that web?
5878999 5881293 You were supposed to be asleep.
5882127 5886882 You know, you were about 6 years old<br />when M.J.'s family moved in next door.
5887090 5891094 When she got out of the car,<br />and you saw her for the first time...
5891303 5897476 ...you grabbed me and said,<br />"Aunt May, is that an angel?"
5897642 5901021 - Did I say that?<br />- You sure did.
5901188 5903023 Now it'll get fast and furious.
5903273 5907694 This last portion of the movie goes<br />at about 100 miles an hour.
5907944 5910655 We'll never be able<br />to talk fast enough.
5910864 5915452 We should go through all the methods<br />that we were thinking of.
5915702 5920499 There's a moment<br />when he has to jettison...
5920707 5923668 ...himself to the<br />Queensborough Bridge...
5923877 5928882 ...and he attaches his webs<br />to the top of these flagpoles...
5929091 5933095 ...pulls himself backward<br />and then lets go and springs off.
5933303 5938058 We went through several ideas<br />on how to get him over there.
5938308 5940811 From cannons to clock springs, to...
5941019 5945273 So much of this next<br />sequence is all virtual sets.
5945440 5949111 It gave us flexibility<br />to explore ideas like that.
5949319 5952364 The thing that's interesting<br />to me is that...
5952614 5956827 ...we paid very little attention<br />to physics.
5957452 5960205 The truth is,<br />I'm a stickler for physics.
5960455 5965168 I like to make stuff kind of stay<br />within the practical world.
5965418 5969131 That probably is a disadvantage.
5969339 5972467 Actually, it's probably<br />a good balance...
5972717 5976138 ...because Sam<br />and the writers' penchant...
5976304 5982060 ...is for writing stuff that's so<br />fantastic that you might not buy it.
5982310 5986898 So I temper that particular tendency<br />on their part by going:
5987149 5990026 "Physically, this couldn't happen."
5990277 5995407 So the sequences that you see here,<br />swing from one end of the pole...
5995615 5999619 ...to the other. Things that<br />are practical and that aren't.
5999828 6005625 But the truth is, it all goes together<br />in a way where you're not aware of it.
6005834 6011339 I think that the willing suspension<br />of disbelief has been achieved here.
6011548 6016511 In a couple of these shots,<br />Anthony and I also got little cameos.
6016761 6021683 - We're people on the ground...<br />- That's my daughter right there.
6022517 6023977 That's Chloe.
6024186 6029191 That was a shot by Brad Booker<br />of him looking into the tram.
6029399 6032903 It was a shot done early on<br />and Sam liked...
6033111 6035447 ...the acting from the Goblin.
6035697 6040577 Lit by Kevin Hahn. It was one<br />of our first lighting jobs on Goblin.
6040785 6045916 This is an integration of all manner<br />of mechanical effects too.
6046166 6049878 We photographed explosions<br />against black so we could...
6050045 6052547 ...combine them in those images.
6052756 6054299 There are miniatures...
6054507 6060055 ...combined with computer generated<br />cables and cable cars and people.
6060305 6065518 This is a real potpourri<br />of the visual effects techniques.
6065769 6069272 We shot from the top<br />of the Queensborough Bridge.
6069481 6073652 We were gonna climb to the top<br />of the bridge and photograph...
6073860 6080075 Here's Anthony's shot of him being<br />shot to the bridge with the flagpoles.
6080283 6085914 Chris Williams, Ken Morissey,<br />Bill Diaz did this great shot of him.
6086164 6091419 <i>And then James Pam's does the shot<br />where he comes over the top here.</i>
6091670 6096132 This is a real great shot in the film.<br />It was a beautiful shot.
6097175 6100762 So this is again...<br />Mechanical effects boys...
6101012 6106851 ...had to provide wind, explosions,<br />fog, smoke and all kinds of things.
6107060 6112190 So it's another case where departments<br />had to collaborate extensively.
6112399 6116569 We did lots of photography<br />on Roosevelt Island in New York.
6116820 6122409 It was exciting to have our own<br />Roosevelt Island tram car.
6122617 6128915 We rented it. We could make it go back<br />and forth, wherever we wanted to.
6129165 6131793 What pre-visualization<br />did for us is...
6131960 6137215 ...when you've a sequence where points<br />of view aren't on the same level...
6137382 6142220 ...you have to establish the camera's<br />angle relative to the live action.
6142429 6145140 Pre-visualization allowed us to say:
6145348 6151438 The camera needs to be 40 feet below<br />the subject on a 15 millimeter lens.
6151688 6157485 Those kinds of details allowed us to<br />photograph our characters...
6157652 6161072 ...in some cases,<br />against green screen...
6161281 6167829 ...then put them into a photography<br />of the real bridge or a CGI bridge.
6168038 6170957 Ken Hahn is the CG<br />supervisor of this...
6171124 6176796 ...and did a great job pulling together<br />all the green screen and CG elements...
6177005 6181718 ...and putting up with listening<br />to me talk about the black levels...
6181926 6185388 ...and different variations<br />across the images.
6185805 6192020 This is a difficult area, to keep the<br />character doing the same thing...
6192187 6198026 ...all the time so there's a continuity<br />of what he does in the physical world.
6198234 6202614 You have a temptation to make<br />the character do something human...
6202822 6206076 ...and you can't<br />let yourself fall into that.
6206326 6212332 Just like before when he was shooting<br />web and going through the bridge.
6212540 6217337 He comes up, flies over the top<br />and I had him landing so hard...
6217504 6220423 ...in this big follow through.
6220632 6224803 Sam said, "He can't do that."<br />I said, "He has to do that."
6225011 6231476 I thought about it and he was right.<br />He's not a person, he's Spider-Man.
6238566 6242237 As opposed to this,<br />which a person could easily do.
6245657 6248827 Lots of pieces went<br />into this sequence.
6249035 6255083 The toughest part is you're working<br />with a large set piece, this bridge.
6255333 6261756 You get close to the characters, it's<br />hard to see the bridge and vice versa.
6261965 6268638 So this was a real tour de force<br />of editing and design of sequence...
6268847 6273393 ...to integrate the pieces so you<br />had a sense of the environment...
6273601 6279858 ...but were still close enough to the<br />characters to read their emotions.
6282777 6288116 It was interesting to just set up all<br />the lighting of our virtual sets...
6288324 6292662 ...and matched pieces. Sometimes<br />it worked, sometimes it didn't.
6292871 6299252 We just dialed in different fall offs<br />and bright and dark areas for shots.
6299544 6301337 Spider-Man, watch out!
6314058 6319147 Interesting thing about this,<br />this is our "hulking ruin" sequence.
6319355 6323067 Spider-Man gets pretty beat up<br />in this sequence.
6323318 6328573 We made a full CG version<br />of Spider-Man completely beat up.
6328781 6331409 One of our guys<br />painted beautiful maps.
6331659 6335163 It's this pristine CG model<br />that looks fabulous.
6335371 6340168 And by the end of the cut that<br />they made, it was no longer in there.
6340335 6344380 I hope in the sequel, there's<br />an area where he's beat up...
6344589 6349719 ...pretty similarly to this so we can<br />use that model. I'm sure we won't.
6350720 6354974 That was the shot that,<br />because of the rating system...
6355183 6358478 He had a mouthful of blood<br />spewing out...
6358686 6363399 ...and to get the rating down<br />to PG-13, we had to turn that blood...
6363608 6366444 ...from red to clear to be spit.
6366694 6373076 We had to take out a bit so it didn't<br />look like he was spewing a fountain.
6373910 6377121 This was an interesting solution<br />with the web.
6377330 6379999 This is of course a new kind of web...
6380250 6386005 ...but also had to look like the real<br />web because it was already shot.
6388091 6391761 Todd Boyce spent a lot of time<br />weaving that pattern...
6391928 6395598 ...making it match the next shot.
6399686 6404983 This sequence really got out down.<br />At one point, it went on for days.
6405191 6408152 The thing that happens<br />is these sequences...
6408403 6414158 ...end up being distillations<br />of much, much larger vintages.
6414367 6417537 The Razorbats used to be<br />in this sequence.
6417787 6422584 There were Razorbats and even another<br />kind of thing at some point.
6422792 6427505 In this sequence, there were flocks<br />of them all over the place.
6429591 6432510 But again,<br />I think that the distillation...
6432677 6436514 ...really focuses on the<br />development of the characters.
6436681 6441060 That's the saving grace of this<br />movie. You pay more attention...
6441227 6445231 ...to the people involved<br />than you do to the...
6445398 6448610 - Action.<br />- Action, yeah.
6451112 6456826 This is definitely an homage to<br />some of Sam's earlier movies.
6456993 6459662 <i>Army</i> of Darkness or whatever.
6468630 6471257 A lot of speed up on this thing.
6473593 6475511 Did that wall move or no?
6477597 6481267 - Can't give away all the secrets.<br />- I'm sorry.
6484187 6487774 Again the spider sense<br />comes into play here.
6487940 6493988 The spider sense thing was a huge<br />combination of many elements.
6494155 6498284 It's a beautiful digital blade<br />that comes out of this.
6500995 6503539 It comes out of the glider.
6505458 6508753 It's photography<br />done on the set, paintwork...
6508920 6512090 ...some CG components<br />that were generated...
6512256 6518137 ...in three dimensions and painted and<br />added. The glider is a virtual...
6518304 6521808 ...version of the glider,<br />a CGI version...
6521974 6524936 ...and that's combined with our...
6525520 6529357 ...actually live actor<br />in the foreground.
6529524 6530942 Give me your hand.
6531234 6535988 For the spider sense shot coming up,<br />Dan Kramer did a great job...
6536155 6540034 ...because we shot different ideas,<br />motion control...
6540201 6545415 ...and the end result ended up being<br />a combination of some of those ideas.
6545581 6550294 So we had to piece together<br />different photography in.
6551754 6553214 Godspeed, Spider-Man.
6555133 6556634 That shot right there.
6568813 6573359 We also, actually, had to try<br />to give a character to the glider...
6573526 6578072 ...to have it and a certain feeling,<br />as silly as that may sound.
6578239 6583327 Well, it's back to<br />your faithful servant, the glider...
6583494 6588374 ...hanging out,<br />waiting to take care...
6588541 6589834 ...of the threat.
6590001 6595590 And of course that sequence was cut<br />down to get into the PG-13 rating.
6595757 6599385 Some of our work was<br />cut out of there as well.
6606350 6611230 I'm sure in the director's cut, the<br />R-rated version, that'll show up.
6611397 6612982 What have you done?!
6618988 6623701 A lot of these shots have to be<br />leading towards sequels to come.
6623868 6626829 Setting up some of the situations.
6630666 6634003 So this is the set-up<br />before the final shot...
6634170 6638007 ...in which Sam had a small request...
6638174 6642345 ...that the animation<br />in this last shot...
6642512 6645431 ...be more incredible,<br />more astounding.
6645598 6651145 The all time, best animated shot in<br />history. That was all he asked for.
6651312 6657735 We went away and tried to do that.<br />This went through many generations.
6658319 6661614 But it was interesting to see...
6661823 6666118 ...as we got down I think John<br />has said before, what is it?
6666285 6670957 Ninety percent of your time you<br />spend getting ready for the shot...
6671123 6676045 ...and 10 percent getting it done.
6679131 6682260 All the camera moves<br />and the animation.
6682468 6685763 There were minute adjustments<br />on these things.
6685930 6690059 One frame of a change<br />of a move where the camera...
6690226 6693062 ...would come close to a<br />building or move.
6693229 6698401 It really got down to a beautiful shot<br />that I think is well remembered...
6698568 6701320 ...in great animation<br />by Peter Giliberti.
6701487 6705241 Lighting and compositing-wise<br />it came down to the wire.
6705408 6710288 Like, our artists Marc Rienzo,<br />Jeff Stern, Dan Abrams...
6710454 6714375 ...Laurence, Dan Eaton<br />all these guys in the last week...
6714542 6718337 ...working around the clock,<br />sleeping under their desks.
6718504 6722383 It's funny, the president<br />of our company, Tim Sarnoff...
6722550 6726971 ...had to come and force these guys<br />to go home and walk them out.
6727138 6730766 We had people drive them home<br />so they wouldn't crash.
6730933 6734520 That's how dedicated<br />they were to this last shot.
6734687 6737815 It took about seven months<br />for this last shot.
6737982 6740484 When you watch this shot...
6740651 6746991 ...I mean, if you've seen the movie in<br />a theatre where it's on a big screen...
6747158 6752997 ...it actually succeeds in getting you<br />to sort of be physically involved...
6753164 6758669 ...in swinging through the city.<br />In terms of a storytelling component...
6758836 6763507 ...it gives you a sense of what<br />it's like to be Spider-Man.
6763674 6768012 Not the irony where he has<br />to deny the woman of his dreams...
6768179 6771974 ...but where you understand<br />why he goes forward.
6772141 6776604 Why he sees some<br />kind of real future...
6776771 6781567 ...in the business of being responsible<br />for this power he wields.
6781734 6785112 It comes along<br />with some great fun too.
6785279 6789200 And I think that this shot<br />embodies all of those things.
6789408 6795039 It embodies the best of the work<br />of the visual effects in the movie.
6796874 6798793 I love you so much, Peter.
6819522 6824276 <i>All I wanted was to tell her<br />how much I loved her.</i>
6824443 6826362 I can't...
6828489 6830032 You can't what?
6831158 6832618 Tell you...
6834328 6838666 ...everything.<br />I mean, there's so much to tell.
6839750 6843671 Yeah. There's so much to tell.
6844588 6846549 I want you to know...
6846966 6849635 ...that I will always be there<br />for you.
6849844 6853806 I will always be there<br />to take care of you.
6854807 6856809 I promise you that.
6860104 6862398 I will always be your friend.
6865317 6867194 Only a friend...
6868070 6869613 ...Peter Parker?
6871782 6874618 That's all I have to give.
6900978 6903647 <i>Whatever life holds in store for</i> me...
6903814 6906692 <i>...I will never forget these words:</i>
6906901 6911947 <i>"With great power<br />comes great responsibility."</i>
6912114 6916327 In the performance of the character,<br />in the beginning...
6916494 6921707 ...he's not sure what move to make,<br />where to shoot his web...
6921874 6926087 ...how to move around it.<br />And through the film he develops.
6926253 6931008 Whereas in this shot, you feel<br />that he knows where he's going...
6931175 6936680 ...and exactly what he's doing and<br />he's in control of his movement.
6940309 6946857 I think a lot of the photography ended<br />up helping us out in the last shot.
6947024 6952655 The photography that we got on that<br />Sunday in downtown L.A. swinging...
6952822 6956033 ...through the cars<br />and everything built off of that.
6956200 6961080 And that stuff you got in New York<br />for the tiles. The sort of...
6961247 6965626 ...golden-hour looking tiles that we<br />processed and pushed more.
6966293 6972383 That sort of grounded it and gave us a<br />base to build our virtual environment.
6975803 6981267 Also we had good success<br />with finishing the buildings off...
6981433 6985980 ...and figuring out how to use them<br />in the lighting...
6986147 6991777 ...environment to make them feel<br />more real. So when you...
6992236 6995865 ...get to the point of watching...
6996031 6999702 ...what he's doing and what's<br />happening around him...
6999910 7001704 ...it's very spectacular.
7001871 7004790 The composition,<br />the choice of buildings...
7004957 7009336 ...the color compositing.<br />Even if it were something that were...
7009503 7013382 ...done for real and wasn't put<br />together as elements...
7013549 7018470 ...it would be<br />a very successful shot.
