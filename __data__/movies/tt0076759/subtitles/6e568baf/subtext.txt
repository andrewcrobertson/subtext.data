152315 154465 ""Attention all crew.... Battle stations.""
154795 156945 ""Attention all crew.... Battle stations.""
163195 164628 Did you hear that?
164915 166395 They shut down the main reactor.
166395 167748 We'll be destroyed for sure.
168155 169224 This is madness.
179155 180190 We're doomed.
183075 184952 There'll be no escape this time.
187755 188744 What"s that?
285035 287105 R2-D2, where are you?
303195 304035 At last!
304035 305150 Where have you been?
305635 307035 They"re heading in this direction.
307035 308184 What are we going to do?
308235 310155 We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel...
310155 312032 smashed into who knows what!
313075 315464 Wait a minute. Where are you going?
327075 330033 The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
330435 332551 Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
332995 335668 What have you done with those plans?
335915 338110 We intercepted no transmissions.
338155 340066 This is a consular ship.
340115 342115 We're on a diplomatic mission.
342115 344151 lf this is a consular ship...
344195 346231 where is the ambassador?
350075 353112 Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those<br />plans...
353155 356113 and bring me the passengers! l want them alive!
368115 369992 There's one. Set for stun.
375075 376986 She'll be all right.
377035 378229 lnform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
380075 383075 Hey! You're not permitted in there. lt"s restricted.
383075 385225 You'll be deactivated for sure.
386195 387992 Don"t you call me a mindless philosopher...
388035 389075 you overweight glob of grease!
389075 390224 Now come out before somebody sees you.
393075 394986 Secret mission? What plans?
395035 396070 What are you talking about?
396275 397867 l'm not getting in there.
400795 402706 l'm going to regret this.
409675 410744 There goes another one.
410875 412866 Hold your fire. There"s no life forms.
413035 414150 lt must have short-circuited.
414195 418234 That"s funny. The damage doesn"t look as bad from out<br />here.
419955 422071 Are you sure this thing is safe?
422635 423624 Oh.
440155 442755 Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.
442755 445115 The lmperial Senate will not sit still for this.
445115 448515 -When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...<br />- Don"t act so surprised, Your Highness.
448515 451234 You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
451275 454155 Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel<br />spies.
454155 456828 l want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
457275 458875 l don"t know what you're talking about.
458875 462345 l'm a member of the lmperial Senate on a diplomatic<br />mission to Alderaan.
462395 464909 You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor.
465035 466150 Take her away!
470675 472035 Holding her is dangerous.
472035 473355 lf word of this gets out...
473355 475346 it could generate sympathyfor the rebellion in the senate.
475635 478468 l've traced the rebel spies to her.
478515 481075 Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.
481235 483032 She'll die before she'll tell you anything.
483075 484155 Leave that to me.
484155 486032 Send a distress signal...
486075 487875 and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed.
487875 488751 Lord Vader,
488795 491025 the battle station plans are not aboard this ship...
491075 492667 and no transmissions were made.
492955 495025 An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting...
495075 496190 but no life forms were aboard.
496755 499110 She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.
499155 503075 Send a detachment down to retrieve them... See to it<br />personally, Commander.
503075 505191 There'll be no one to stop us this time.
505235 506224 Yes, sir.
520355 522107 How did we get into this mess?
522155 525033 l really don't know how.
525075 526995 We seem to be made to suffer.
526995 528064 lt's our lot in life.
530635 533103 l've got to rest before l fall apart.
533155 535111 My joints are almostfrozen.
540995 543145 What a desolate place this is!
547195 549115 Where do you think you're going?
549115 551026 Well, l'm not going that way.
551075 552190 lt's much too rocky.
553115 555026 This way is much easier.
555075 557031 What makes you think there are settlements over there?
559435 560504 Don"t gettechnical with me.
561835 564224 What mission? What are you talking about?
566195 568311 l've just about had enough of you.
569115 570184 Go thatway.
570275 574195 You'll be malfunctioning within a day you nearsighted<br />scrap pile.
574195 576151 And don't let me catch you following me begging for<br />help...
576195 577264 because you won"t get it.
591155 592304 No more adventures.
592915 594109 l'm not going thatway.
627155 628224 That malfunctioning little twerp.
628275 630275 This is all his fault.
630275 632315 He tricked me into going this way...
632315 634271 but he'll do no better.
637435 639312 Wait! What's that?
639355 640424 Atransport.
640955 642070 l'm saved!
642395 644315 Over here!
644315 645304 Hey!
645355 647275 Hey!
647275 650392 Help! Please help!
851435 853232 R2?
856355 859427 R2-D2, it is you! lt is you!
891355 893152 Someone was in the pod.
893195 895311 The tracks go off in this direction.
895795 897751 Look, sir, droids.
911755 913075 We stopped.
913075 914793 Wake up! Wake up!
921235 922873 We're doomed.
930755 932746 Do you think they"ll melt us down?
945395 947306 Don"t shoot! Don't shoot!
947355 948195 Will this never end?
948195 948513 Will this never end?
987355 989195 Yeh, all right, fine. Let's go.
989195 991186 Luke! Luke!
995355 998075 Luke, tell Uncle if he gets a translator...
998075 999508 be sure it speaks Bocce.
999555 1002388 Doesn't look like we have much of a choice, but l"ll remind<br />him.
1012635 1014546 Yeah, we'll take that red one.
1014955 1016513 No, not that one.
1018155 1019075 You!
1019075 1021355 l suppose you're programmed for etiquette and protocol.
1021355 1023550 Protocol? Why, it's my primaryfunction, sir.
1023635 1025353 l am well-versed in all the customs...
1025395 1027272 l have no need for a protocol droid.
1027315 1028430 Of course you haven"t, sir.
1028475 1029510 Not in an environment such as this.
1030275 1031344 That is why l have been programmed...
1031395 1033386 What l really need is a droid who understands...
1033435 1035346 the binary language of moisture vaporators.
1035395 1038432 Vaporators? Sir, my first job was programming binary load<br />lifters...
1038475 1040355 very similar to your vaporators in most respects.
1040355 1041424 Can you speak Bocce?
1041515 1043635 Of course l can, sir. lt's like a second language to me...
1043635 1045595 - l'm as fluent in....<br />-Yeah, all right. Shut up. l"ll take this one.
1045595 1046311 Shutting up sir.
1046675 1047710 Luke!
1049675 1051675 Take these two over to the garage, will you?
1051675 1052710 l want them cleaned up before dinner.
1052755 1053744 But l was going into Tosche Station...
1053795 1055592 to pick up some power converters.
1055635 1056715 You can waste time with your friends...
1056715 1058035 when your chores are done.
1058035 1059991 Now come on. Get to it.
1060595 1062631 All right. Come on.
1064995 1066951 And the red one. Come on.
1068035 1070105 Well, come on, red. Let's go.
1088635 1089635 Uncle Owen!
1089635 1090704 Yeah?
1090755 1093675 This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.
1093675 1095745 Hey, what are you trying to push on us?
1098595 1099710 Excuse me, sir...
1099755 1103543 but that R2 unit is in prime condition, a real bargain.
1103595 1105631 Uncle Owen, what aboutthat one?
1105675 1106744 What about that blue one?
1106795 1108228 We'll take that one.
1109275 1111743 l'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.
1111795 1113706 He really is in first-class condition.
1113755 1114790 l've worked with him before.
1115235 1115747 Here he comes.
1119675 1120744 O.K. Let's go.
1121555 1122755 Now, don"t you forget this.
1122755 1124666 Why l should stick my neck out for you...
1124715 1126671 is quite beyond my capacity.
1132555 1133749 Thank the maker!
1133795 1135751 This oil bath is going to feel so good.
1136915 1139275 l've got such a bad case of dust contamination...
1139275 1140674 l can barely move.
1140715 1141704 lt just isn't fair.
1141755 1143635 Oh, Biggs is right.
1143635 1145715 l'm never gonna get out of here.
1145715 1147715 ls there anything l might do to help?
1147715 1150035 No. Not unless you can alter time...
1150035 1152675 speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock.
1152675 1153994 l don't think so, sir.
1154115 1154915 l'm only a droid...
1154915 1156792 and not very knowledgeable about such things...
1156995 1158713 not on this planet, anyway.
1158755 1162543 As a matter offact, l'm not even sure which planet l"m on.
1162595 1164665 Well, if there's a bright center to the universe...
1164715 1166467 you're on the planet that it"s farthest from.
1166795 1167784 l see, sir.
1168595 1169744 You can call me Luke.
1170275 1171344 l see, Sir Luke.
1171715 1172431 Ha ha.
1172715 1173431 No,just Luke.
1173635 1173953 Oh.
1174835 1177668 And l am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.
1177715 1179785 And this is my counterpart... R2-D2.
1180555 1181590 Hello.
1182675 1184715 You got a lot of carbon scoring here.
1184715 1186706 Looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
1186755 1188075 With all we've been through...
1188075 1190275 sometimes l'm amazed we're in as good condition as we<br />are...
1190275 1191715 what with the rebellion and all.
1191715 1193671 You know ofthe rebellion against the Empire?!
1193715 1195275 That"s how we came to be in your service...
1195275 1196628 if you take my meaning, sir.
1197195 1198355 Have you been in many battles?
1198355 1199475 Several, l think.
1199475 1201591 Actually, there"s not much to tell.
1201635 1203395 l'm not much more than an interpreter...
1203395 1204794 and not very good attelling stories.
1204955 1207635 Well, not at making them interesting, anyway.
1207635 1209635 Well, my little friend...
1209635 1212075 you got something jammed in here real good.
1212075 1213667 Were you on a Starcruiser or...
1213715 1216752 Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
1217275 1218503 What's this?
1218835 1220791 ""What is what''? He asked you a question.
1221075 1222269 What is that?
1222315 1223395 Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1223395 1225431 You're my only hope.
1229235 1230715 Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1230715 1232273 You're my only hope.
1234835 1237303 Oh. He says it"s nothing, sir, merely a malfunction.
1237355 1239311 Old data. Pay it no mind.
1239355 1241425 Who is she? She's beautiful.
1241475 1244512 l'm afraid l'm not quite sure, sir.
1245275 1247345 l think she was a passenger on our last voyage.
1247395 1249315 A person of some importance, l believe.
1249315 1250355 Our captain was attached...
1250355 1251390 ls there any more to this recording?
1253395 1254464 Behave yourself, R2.
1254515 1256426 You're going to get us into trouble.
1256475 1259353 lt's all right. You can trust him. He's our new master.
1262275 1265347 He says that he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi...
1265395 1266464 a resident of these parts...
1266875 1268433 and it's a private message for him.
1268475 1270431 Quite frankly, sir, l don't know what he"s talking about.
1270475 1272431 Our last master was Captain Antilles.
1272475 1274306 But with all we"ve been through...
1274355 1277313 this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
1277355 1280347 Obi-Wan Kenobi. l wonder ifhe means old Ben Kenobi.
1280395 1283035 l beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking<br />about?
1283035 1285275 Well, l don't know anyone named Obi-Wan...
1285275 1288355 but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.
1288355 1290266 He's kind of a strange old hermit.
1290315 1291384 Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1291435 1293266 l wonder who she is.
1293315 1294304 Sounds like she"s in trouble.
1294355 1296311 l better play back the whole thing.
1298675 1300715 He says the restraining bolt...
1300715 1303355 has short-circuited his recording system.
1303355 1305435 He suggests that if you remove the bolt...
1305435 1307471 he might be able to play back the entire recording.
1308275 1310311 Oh, yeah. Well...
1310355 1312425 l guess you're too small to run away on me...
1312475 1313510 if l take this off.
1314275 1315264 OK...
1317395 1319351 There you go.
1320435 1322035 Wait a minute. Where'd she go?
1322035 1324105 Bring her back. Play back the entire message.
1324275 1325264 ""What message''?
1325875 1327308 The one you've just been playing!
1327355 1329346 The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards.
1329675 1331347 Luke! Luke!
1331795 1332864 All right, l'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
1333635 1334750 l'm sorry, sir...
1334795 1337355 but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
1337355 1338715 Here. See what you can do with him.
1338715 1340194 l'll be right back.
1342995 1346146 Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
1346755 1348746 No, l don'tthink he likes you at all.
1349515 1351551 No, l don't like you, either.
1359595 1362715 You know, l think that R2 unit we bought might have been<br />stolen.
1362715 1364355 What makes you think that?
1364355 1367153 Well, l stumbled across a recording while l was cleaning<br />him.
1367195 1370153 He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1371435 1373555 l thought he might have meant old Ben.
1373555 1374704 Do you know what he's talking about?
1374835 1375790 Mm-mm.
1376355 1378664 l wonder if he's related to Ben.
1379075 1380190 Thatwizard's just a crazy old man.
1381675 1384035 Tomorrow, l want you to take that R2 unit to Anchorhead...
1384035 1385673 and have its memory erased.
1385715 1387671 That"ll be the end of it. lt belongs to us now.
1389235 1391703 But what ifthis Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
1392235 1393224 He won't.
1393995 1396065 l don"t think he exists any more.
1396115 1398151 He died about the same time as your father.
1398195 1399230 He knew my father?
1400035 1401184 l told you to forget it.
1401755 1405668 Your only concern is to prepare those new droids for<br />tomorrow.
1405715 1409195 ln the morning, l want them up there on the south ridge<br />working on those condensers.
1409195 1410184 Yes, sir.
1411475 1413545 l think those new droids are gonna work out fine.
1414155 1417306 ln fact, l, uh, was also thinking about our agreement...
1417355 1420347 about me staying on another season?
1421395 1423075 And if these new droids do work out...
1423075 1425225 l want to transmit my application to the academythis year.
1425475 1427635 You mean the next semester before the harvest?
1427635 1429595 Sure. There's more than enough droids.
1429595 1431586 Harvest is when l need you the most.
1431635 1433591 lt's only one season more.
1433635 1435475 This year we"ll make enough on the harvest...
1435475 1436955 that l"ll be able to hire more hands...
1436955 1439628 and then you can go to the academy next year.
1439675 1441586 You must understand l need you here, Luke.
1441635 1443555 But it"s a whole "nother year!
1443555 1444675 Look, it's only one more season.
1444675 1446666 Yeah, that's what you said when Biggs and Tank left.
1446715 1447431 Where are you going?
1447955 1449354 Looks like l'm going nowhere.
1449395 1451306 l have to go finish cleaning those droids.
1451355 1453315 Owen, he can't stay here forever.
1453315 1454384 Most of his friends have gone.
1454435 1456435 lt means so much to him.
1456435 1458346 l'll make it up to him next year.
1458395 1459384 l promise.
1460315 1462465 Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
1462515 1464471 He has too much of his father in him.
1464515 1466506 That"s what l'm afraid of.
1512395 1514315 Ooh!
1514315 1515435 What are you doing hiding back there?
1515435 1518472 lt wasn"t myfault, sir. Please don"t deactivate me.
1518515 1521427 l told him notto go, but he"s faulty, malfunctioning.
1521475 1523352 Kept babbling on about his mission.
1523395 1524510 Oh, no.
1532395 1535353 That R2 unit has always been a problem.
1535395 1537465 These astrodroids are getting quite out of hand.
1537515 1539471 Even l can"t understand their logic attimes.
1539515 1541346 How could l be so stupid?
1541395 1542430 He's nowhere in sight.
1542955 1543990 Blast it!
1544315 1546395 Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
1546395 1548067 lt's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around.
1548115 1549715 We'll have to wait until morning.
1549715 1551387 Luke! l'm shutting the power down.
1551435 1553515 All right! l'll be there in a few minutes.
1553515 1555395 Boy, am l gonna get it.
1555395 1558355 You know, that little droid's going to cause me a lotta<br />trouble.
1558355 1560425 Oh, he excels at that, sir.
1561435 1562550 Come on.
1570315 1571350 Luke?
1572835 1573824 Luke!
1575315 1576384 Luke!
1582155 1584315 Have you seen Luke this morning?
1584315 1586306 He said he had some things to do before he started today...
1586355 1587390 so he left early.
1587475 1589155 Did he take those two new droids with him?
1589155 1590383 l think so.
1590435 1593315 Well, he better have those units in the south range...
1593315 1595431 repaired by midday, or there"ll be hell to pay.
1595475 1597386 Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner.
1597435 1598555 Dead ahead.
1598555 1600750 lt might be our little R2 unit. Hit the accelerator!
1622915 1625827 Hey, whoa! Justwhere do you think you're going?
1626195 1628311 Master Luke is your rightful owner now.
1628355 1631313 We'll have no more ofthis Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.
1631995 1633474 And don"t talk to me of your mission, either.
1633515 1635312 You're fortunate he doesn't blast you...
1635355 1636424 into a million pieces right here!
1636475 1638466 No. lt"s all right, but l think we'd better go.
1640075 1642035 What's wrong with him now?
1642035 1644390 There are several creatures approaching from the<br />southeast.
1645235 1647669 Sandpeople, or worse.
1648395 1650355 Come on. Let's go have a look.
1650355 1651390 Come on!
1653795 1656435 Well, there are two Banthas down there...
1656435 1658426 but l don't see any... Wait a second.
1659115 1660184 They"re Sandpeople, all right.
1660315 1662465 l can see one of them now.
1733435 1735312 Hello, there.
1737395 1740432 Come here, my little friend. Don"t be afraid.
1742435 1744471 Oh, don"t worry. He'll be all right.
1750395 1753307 Rest easy, son. You"ve had a busy day.
1753355 1756506 You're fortunate to be all in one piece.
1759355 1760390 Ben?
1760435 1762315 Ben Kenobi?
1762315 1764315 Boy, am l glad to see you.
1764315 1767307 TheJundland Wastes are notto be traveled lightly.
1769315 1771306 Tell me, young Luke...
1771355 1773550 what brings you out this far?
1774315 1775464 This little droid.
1777475 1779355 l think he"s searching for his former master...
1779355 1782427 but l've never seen such devotion in a droid before.
1782475 1784435 He claims to be the property...
1784435 1786312 of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1786355 1787390 ls he a relative of yours?
1787435 1789471 Do you know who he's talking about?
1790475 1792466 Obi-Wan Kenobi?
1794075 1796066 Obi-Wan.
1796115 1801030 Now, that's a name l've not heard in a long time.
1801075 1803145 A long time.
1803195 1805475 l think my uncle knows him.
1805475 1807113 He said he was dead.
1807155 1809066 Oh, he's not dead.
1809115 1810104 Not yet.
1810155 1811475 You know him?
1811475 1814945 Well, of course l know him. He"s me.
1816955 1820152 l haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan...
1820195 1822515 since, oh, before you were born.
1822515 1824426 Well, then the droid does belong to you.
1824475 1826591 l don"t seem to remember ever owning a droid.
1828555 1829590 Very interesting.
1831435 1833630 l think we better get indoors.
1834395 1836515 The Sandpeople are easily startled...
1836515 1839587 but they'll soon be back, and in greater numbers.
1842515 1843584 3PO.
1852595 1855507 Where am l? l must have taken a bad step.
1856595 1858472 Can you stand?
1858515 1859630 We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.
1860435 1862505 l don"t think l can make it. You go on, Master Luke.
1862555 1865433 There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.
1865475 1866544 l'm done for.
1867315 1868464 No, you're not.
1868515 1869504 What kind of talk is that?
1869555 1871432 Quickly. They're on the move.
1879835 1883032 Now let's see ifwe can't figure out what you are, my little<br />friend...
1883075 1885035 and where you come from.
1885035 1886946 l saw part of a message he was...
1886995 1888951 l seem to have found it.
1888995 1892954 General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the<br />Clone Wars.
1892995 1894835 Now he begs you to help him...
1894835 1896871 in his struggle against the Empire.
1896915 1899835 l regret that l am unable to present myfather's requestto<br />you in person.
1899835 1901835 But my ship has fallen under attack...
1901835 1903871 and l am afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has<br />failed.
1903915 1905835 l have placed information...
1905835 1906984 vital to the survival of the rebellion...
1907035 1908946 into the memory systems of this R2 unit.
1908995 1910906 Myfather will know how to retrieve it.
1910955 1912832 You must see this droid...
1912875 1914995 safely delivered to him on Alderaan.
1914995 1916906 This is our most desperate hour.
1916955 1920914 Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
1928595 1930395 You fought in the Clone Wars?
1930395 1933915 Yes. l was once a Jedi knight the same as your father.
1933915 1935871 No, myfather didn"t fight in the wars.
1935915 1937826 He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
1937875 1939786 That's what your uncle told you.
1939835 1941746 He didn't hold with your father"s ideals.
1941795 1945629 Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten<br />involved.
1945955 1947104 l wish l'd known him.
1947155 1950113 He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...
1950875 1952635 and a cunning warrior.
1952635 1953954 l understand you"ve become...
1953995 1956111 quite a good pilot yourself.
1956915 1959035 And he was a good friend.
1959035 1959115 And he was a good friend.
1959115 1961151 Which reminds me...
1961915 1964065 l have something here for you.
1966075 1968075 Your father wanted you to have this...
1968075 1972114 when you were old enough. But your uncle wouldn't allow<br />it.
1972155 1974032 He feared you mightfollow old Obi-Wan...
1974075 1976031 on some damn-fool idealistic crusade...
1976075 1977986 like your father did.
1978035 1979475 Sir, if you'll not be needing me...
1979475 1980435 l'll close down for a while.
1980435 1981584 Sure. Go ahead.
1984715 1985555 What is it?
1985555 1987705 lt's your father"s lightsaber.
1988235 1990829 This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.
1991195 1994595 Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.
1994595 2000545 An elegantweapon for a more civilized age.
2000595 2002631 For over a thousand generations...
2002675 2004586 theJedi knights were the guardians...
2004635 2007627 of peace and justice in the old Republic...
2008875 2010995 before the dark times...
2010995 2012872 before the Empire.
2015115 2017185 How did my father die?
2018915 2021873 A young Jedi named Darth Vader...
2021915 2024907 who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil...
2024955 2028914 helped the Empire hunt down and destroy theJedi knights.
2030035 2032913 He betrayed and murdered your father.
2032955 2036868 Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
2036915 2041067 Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
2041875 2042944 The Force?
2043795 2046835 Now the Force is what gives a Jedi his power.
2046835 2050075 lt's an energyfield created by all living things.
2050075 2052031 lt surrounds us and penetrates us...
2052075 2054031 it binds the galaxytogether.
2056555 2058625 You must learn the ways of the Force...
2058675 2060711 if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
2060755 2063553 Alderaan? l"m not going to Alderaan.
2063595 2064715 l've got to get home.
2064715 2066546 lt's late. l'm in for it as it is.
2066595 2068755 l need your help, Luke. She needs your help.
2068755 2071747 l'm getting too old for this sort ofthing.
2075755 2077552 l can't get involved.
2077995 2079394 l've got work to do.
2079715 2082548 lt's not that l like the Empire. l hate it...
2082595 2085587 but there's nothing l can do about it right now.
2085635 2087626 lt's all such a long way from here.
2087675 2089631 That"s your uncle talking.
2089675 2090710 Boy, my uncle.
2091435 2093395 How am l ever gonna explain this?
2093395 2095545 Learn about the Force, Luke.
2101395 2103750 Look, l can take you as far as Anchorhead.
2104315 2107751 You can get a transportthere to Mos Eisley or wherever<br />you're going.
2108515 2111712 You must do what you feel is right, of course.
2140475 2142431 Until this battle station is fully operational...
2142475 2143544 we are vulnerable.
2143595 2145586 The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
2145635 2147591 They"re more dangerous than you realize.
2147635 2150433 Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander...
2150475 2152466 not to this battle station.
2152515 2156075 The rebellion will continue to gain a support in the<br />lmperial Senate...
2156075 2159624 The lmperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to<br />us.
2159995 2161508 l have just received word...
2161555 2164435 that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently.
2164435 2166551 The last remnants of the old Republic...
2166595 2168315 have been swept away.
2168315 2169589 -The senate dissolved?<br />-That"s impossible.
2169635 2172435 How will the emperor maintain control withoutthe<br />bureaucracy?
2172435 2175313 The regional governors now have direct control...
2175435 2176584 over their territories.
2176635 2180594 Fear will keep the local systems in line...
2180635 2182432 fear of this battle station.
2182475 2184435 And what of the rebellion?
2184435 2185629 lf the rebels have obtained...
2185675 2187472 a complete technical readout of this station...
2187515 2189392 it is possible, however unlikely...
2189435 2191471 that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
2191875 2195504 The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
2195555 2197625 Any attack made bythe rebels against this station...
2197915 2199473 would be a useless gesture...
2199515 2201595 no matter what technical data they've obtained.
2201595 2205474 This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.
2205515 2207551 l suggest we use it.
2207595 2209435 Don"t be too proud...
2209435 2211471 of this technological terror you"ve constructed.
2211515 2214552 The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant...
2214595 2216631 next to the power of the Force.
2217435 2220472 Don"t tryto frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord<br />Vader.
2220515 2223473 Your sad devotion to that ancient religion...
2223515 2225585 hasn't helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes...
2225635 2227591 or given you clairvoyance enough...
2227635 2229626 to find the rebels' hidden fortre...
2236195 2239107 l find your lack of faith disturbing.
2240475 2242591 Enough of this. Vader, release him.
2242635 2244512 As you wish.
2246515 2248506 This bickering is pointless.
2249155 2253433 Now Lord Vader will provide us with the location ofthe<br />rebel fortress...
2253475 2255625 by the time this station is operational.
2255995 2257955 We will then crush the rebellion...
2257955 2259024 with one swift stroke.
2266075 2268115 lt looks like the Sandpeople did this, all right.
2268115 2269628 Look. There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.
2269675 2271427 lt's just, l've never heard ofthem...
2271475 2272430 hitting anything this big before.
2272475 2273464 They didn't...
2273515 2275585 but we are meant to think they did.
2275635 2277546 These tracks are side-by-side.
2277595 2279631 Sandpeople always ride single file...
2280035 2281593 to hide their numbers.
2281635 2284433 These are the sameJawas that sold us R2 and 3PO.
2284475 2287555 And these blast points, too accurate...
2287555 2288624 for Sandpeople.
2289435 2292472 Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
2292515 2295507 But why would imperial troops wantto slaughter Jawas?
2299635 2301626 lf they traced the robots here...
2301875 2303475 they may have learned who they sold them to...
2303475 2305466 and that would lead them back... home!
2305515 2306630 Wait, Luke!
2307395 2308595 lt's too dangerous!
2331595 2333426 Uncle Owen!
2333475 2335545 Aunt Beru!
2335595 2336630 Uncle Owen!
2385115 2386104 And now, Your Highness...
2386235 2388146 we will discuss the location...
2388315 2390351 of your hidden rebel base.
2431515 2434195 There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been<br />there.
2434195 2436026 You'd have been killed, too...
2436795 2440635 and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.
2440635 2443388 l want to come with you to Alderaan.
2443435 2444584 There's nothing for me here now.
2445315 2447195 l want to learn the ways of the Force...
2447195 2449106 and become a Jedi like my father.
2463475 2465625 Mos Eisley spaceport.
2466435 2471435 You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and<br />villainy.
2471435 2473426 We must be cautious.
2502315 2504306 How long have you had these droids?
2504355 2505795 Aboutthree or four seasons.
2505795 2507467 They"re up for sale if you wantthem.
2507635 2509546 Let me see your identification.
2509595 2512632 You don"t need to see his identification.
2512675 2515473 We don"t need to see his identification.
2515515 2517551 These aren"t the droids you"re looking for.
2517595 2520507 These aren"t the droids we're looking for.
2520555 2522625 He can go about his business.
2522675 2524595 You can go about your business.
2524595 2525550 Move along.
2526275 2527310 Move along.
2527595 2528630 Move along.
2544115 2548035 l can't abide thoseJawas. Disgusting creatures!
2548035 2550595 Go on, go on.
2551475 2553511 l can't understand how we got by those troops.
2553555 2554635 l thought we were dead.
2554635 2557547 The Force can have a strong influence...
2557595 2558664 on the weak-minded.
2561675 2563555 Do you really think we're gonna find a pilot here...
2563555 2564670 that"ll take us to Alderaan?
2565475 2567675 Most of the best freighter pilots are to be found here...
2567675 2569506 only watch your step.
2569555 2571466 This place can be a little rough.
2571515 2573506 l'm ready for anything.
2576595 2578472 Come along, R2.
2626555 2629555 Hey! We don't serve their kind here.
2629555 2630555 What?
2630555 2632432 Your droids, they'll have to wait outside.
2632475 2633515 We don't want them here.
2633515 2634550 Why don't you wait out by the speeder?
2634595 2635595 We don't want any trouble.
2635595 2637551 l heartily agree with you, sir.
2645595 2646635 Uh...
2646635 2648466 l'll have one of those.
2682275 2683628 He doesn't like you.
2683675 2685586 l'm sorry.
2686395 2688465 l don't like you, either.
2688515 2690115 You just watch yourself.
2690115 2691514 We're wanted men.
2691555 2694395 l have the death sentence on 12 systems.
2694395 2696226 l'll be careful then.
2696275 2697315 You'll be dead!
2697315 2699271 This little one's not worth the effort.
2699915 2701951 Come, let me get you something.
2704595 2706870 No blasters!! No blasters!!
2707795 2709786 Aah!
2727355 2728424 l'm all right.
2731115 2733151 Chewbacca here is first mate...
2733195 2736153 on a ship that might suit us.
2739155 2742227 l don"t like the look ofthis.
2755435 2759394 Han Solo. l'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.
2759435 2762472 Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the<br />Alderaan system.
2762515 2764551 Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.
2765035 2768595 Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
2768595 2770235 Should l have?
2770235 2773227 lt's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than 12<br />parsecs.
2775195 2777231 l've outrun imperial starships.
2777275 2779231 Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.
2779275 2781266 l'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.
2783235 2785271 She's fast enough for you, old man.
2785315 2787192 What's the cargo?
2787235 2790227 Only passengers... myself, the boy...
2790435 2791914 two droids...
2792155 2794350 and no questions asked.
2795115 2797345 What is it, some kind of local trouble?
2798115 2800355 Let's just say we'd like to avoid...
2800355 2802346 any imperial entanglements.
2803995 2806987 Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?
2807115 2809151 And it's gonna cost you something extra.
2810275 2812231 10,000, all in advance.
2813795 2815194 10,000?
2815915 2818355 We could almost buy our own ship for that!
2818355 2821153 But who's gonna fly it, kid, you?
2821195 2823186 You bet l could. l"m not such a bad pilot myself.
2823235 2825271 We don"t have to sit here and listen...
2825315 2828307 We can pay you 2,000 now...
2828355 2831313 plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.
2831355 2833266 Seventeen, huh?
2835275 2839188 O.K. You guys got yourselves a ship.
2839235 2840270 We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
2840315 2841304 Docking Bay 94.
2841355 2843152 Ninety-four.
2844315 2846355 Looks like somebody"s beginning to take an interest...
2846355 2848505 in your handiwork.
2849235 2851226 All right. We'll check it out.
2862315 2863515 17,000!
2863515 2865312 Those guys must really be desperate.
2865355 2867311 This could really save my neck.
2867355 2869789 Get back to the ship, get her ready.
2870275 2871635 You'll have to sell your speeder.
2871635 2874388 That's alright. l don't think l'll be coming back to this<br />planet anyway.
2877275 2878395 Yes, Greedo.
2878395 2880515 As a matter offact, l was just going to see your boss.
2880515 2883109 Tell Jabba that l've got his money.
2895355 2898108 Yeah, butthis time l've got the money.
2901835 2903675 l don"t have it with me.
2903675 2904312 Tell Jabba...
2912155 2914155 Even l get boarded sometimes.
2914155 2915634 Do you think l had a choice?
2920195 2922186 Over my dead body.
2927475 2929943 Yes, l'll bet you have.
2942155 2943349 Sorry aboutthe mess.
2952315 2956149 Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.
2956195 2959153 lt'll be some time before we can extract any information<br />from her.
2959195 2961151 The final checkout is completed.
2961195 2962315 All systems are operational.
2962315 2964271 What course shall we set?
2964315 2966192 Perhaps she would respond...
2966235 2968195 to an alternative form of persuasion.
2968195 2969264 What do you mean?
2969315 2971271 l think it is time we demonstrated...
2971315 2973192 the full power of this station.
2973235 2974350 Set your course for Alderaan.
2974475 2975544 With pleasure.
2976235 2978271 Lock the door, R2.
2979755 2983509 Alright. Check that side of the street.
2986315 2989307 lt's secure. Move on to the next one.
2994875 2997025 l would much rather have gone with Master Luke...
2997155 2998224 than stay here with you.
2998275 3000311 l don"t know what all this trouble is about...
3000355 3002232 but l'm sure it must be your fault.
3002995 3004314 You watch your language.
3006315 3009307 All right. Give it to me. l"ll take it.
3009355 3010795 Look at this.
3010795 3013235 Ever since the XP-38 came out, they just aren't in demand.
3013235 3014350 lt'll be enough.
3030995 3032951 lf the ship's as fast as he's boasting...
3032995 3034713 we ought to do well.
3042915 3046146 Be careful R2.
3054875 3056786 What a piece of junk!
3056835 3058871 She'll make.5 past light speed.
3058915 3060315 She may not look like much...
3060315 3061907 but she's got it where it counts, kid.
3062075 3064828 l've made a lot of special modifications myself.
3064875 3067708 But we"re a little rushed, so if you'll just get on board...
3067755 3070030 we'll get outta here.
3073675 3074710 Hello, sir.
3082915 3084746 Which way?
3085915 3088713 All right, men, load your weapons.
3089835 3092713 Stop that ship! Blast them!
3100795 3101944 Chewie, get us out ofhere!
3103835 3107794 Oh, my. l'd forgotten how much l hate space travel.
3125435 3126915 Looks like an imperial cruiser.
3126915 3128314 Our passengers must be hotter than l thought.
3128355 3129435 Try and hold 'em off.
3129435 3130993 Angle the deflector shields while l make the calculations...
3131035 3131990 for the jump to light speed.
3141955 3143832 Stay sharp. There's two more comin" in.
3143875 3145395 They"re gonna try and cut us off.
3145395 3147351 Why don't you outrun "em? l thought you said this thing<br />was fast!
3147395 3148987 Watch your mouth, kid, or you're gonna find yourself<br />floating home.
3149035 3150832 We'll be safe enough...
3150875 3152831 once we make the jump to hyperspace.
3152875 3154786 Besides, l know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 'em.
3158795 3159989 Here's where the fun begins.
3160395 3162435 How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
3162435 3164869 lt'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the<br />navicomputer.
3164915 3166826 Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining?
3166875 3169867 Traveling through hyperspace ain"t like dustin' crops, boy!
3169915 3170904 Without precise calculations...
3170955 3171944 we'd fly rightthrough a star...
3171995 3173826 or bounce too close to a supernova...
3173875 3175831 and that would end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
3175875 3176875 What's that flashing?
3176875 3177830 We're losing a deflector shield.
3177875 3178955 Go strap yourselves in.
3178955 3180911 l'm gonna make the jump to light speed.
3201635 3203671 We've entered the Alderaan system.
3204475 3205510 Governor Tarkin.
3205555 3206624 l should have expected...
3206675 3208586 to find you holding Vader's leash.
3208635 3210512 l recognized your foul stench...
3210555 3212511 when l was brought on board.
3213155 3215350 Charming to the last.
3215595 3217435 You don't know how hard l found it...
3217435 3219275 signing the order to terminate your life.
3219275 3220915 l'm surprised you had the courage...
3220915 3222675 to take the responsibility yourself.
3222675 3224870 Princess Leia, before your execution...
3225675 3226835 l would like you to be my guest...
3226835 3230669 at a ceremony that will make this battle station<br />operational.
3230715 3233715 No star system will dare oppose the emperor now.
3233715 3235785 The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin...
3235835 3238755 the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
3238755 3241713 Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.
3241755 3243825 ln a way, you have determined...
3243875 3246787 the choice of the planetthat will be destroyed first.
3246835 3248746 Since you are reluctant...
3248795 3251755 to provide us with the location of the rebel base...
3251755 3254713 l have chosen to test this station's destructive power...
3254755 3257713 on your home planet of Alderaan.
3257755 3259235 No! Alderaan is peaceful.
3259235 3260715 We have no weapons. You can't possibly...
3260715 3262512 You would prefer another target? A militarytarget?
3262675 3264791 Then name the system.
3266755 3269792 l grow tired of asking this, so it will be the last time.
3270635 3273513 Where is the rebel base?
3276475 3277828 Dantooine.
3277875 3279715 They"re on Dantooine.
3279715 3281395 There. You see, Lord Vader?
3281395 3283670 She can be reasonable.
3283715 3284864 Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.
3285675 3286744 What?
3286795 3287875 You're far too trusting.
3287875 3289755 Dantooine is too remote...
3289755 3291871 to make an effective demonstration, but don't worry.
3291915 3294827 We will deal with your rebel friends soon enough.
3294875 3295864 No!
3297675 3299666 Commence primary ignition.
3321475 3324795 Are you all right? What's wrong?
3324795 3326875 l felt a great disturbance in the Force...
3326875 3328752 as if millions of voices...
3328795 3330751 suddenly cried out in terror...
3330795 3331910 and were suddenly silenced.
3332675 3334825 l fear something terrible has happened.
3335995 3338828 You'd better get on with your exercises.
3340835 3343713 Well, you can forget your troubles with those imperial<br />slugs.
3343755 3345711 l told you l'd outrun them.
3348915 3351668 Don"t everybody thank me at once.
3351715 3355788 Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about 0200 hours.
3362355 3364266 Now be careful, R2.
3372955 3375753 He made a fair move. Screaming about it can't help you.
3375795 3378707 Let him have it. lt's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
3378755 3380791 But, sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
3380835 3383793 That"s 'cause a droid don"t pull people's arms out oftheir<br />sockets...
3383835 3385666 when they lose.
3385715 3387671 Wookiees are known to do that.
3388875 3391708 l see your point, sir.
3391755 3392824 l suggest a new strategy, R2.
3392875 3394706 Let the Wookiee win.
3411755 3415748 Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
3415795 3417795 You mean it controls your actions?
3417795 3420753 Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
3424835 3427835 Hokey religions and ancientweapons are no match...
3427835 3429746 for a good blaster at your side, kid.
3429795 3431831 You don't believe in the Force, do you?
3431875 3434867 Kid, l've flown from one side of this galaxyto the other.
3434915 3436792 l've seen a lot of strange stuff...
3436835 3438871 but l've never seen anything to make me believe...
3438915 3441995 there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
3441995 3445954 There's no mystical energyfield controls my destiny.
3445995 3449075 lt's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
3449075 3452909 l suggest you try it again, Luke.
3452955 3455867 This time, let go your conscious self...
3457115 3459106 and act on instinct.
3459915 3462955 With the blast shield down, l can't even see.
3462955 3464024 How am l supposed to fight?
3464075 3465075 Your eyes can deceive you.
3465075 3466110 Don"t trustthem.
3475115 3477913 Stretch out with your feelings.
3491875 3493866 You see? You can do it.
3493915 3495075 l call it luck.
3495075 3497953 ln my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
3497995 3500075 Look, good against remotes is one thing.
3500075 3503033 Good against the living, that's something else.
3504315 3506033 Looks like we"re coming up on Alderaan.
3509075 3510110 You know, l did feel something.
3510915 3511955 l could almost see the remote.
3511955 3512944 That's good.
3512995 3515873 You've taken your first step into a larger world.
3520795 3521784 Yes?
3522195 3524755 Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.
3524795 3526706 They found the remains of a rebel base...
3526755 3528835 but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.
3528835 3531952 They are now conducting an extensive search ofthe<br />surrounding systems.
3532715 3534945 She lied. She lied to us!
3535715 3537865 l told you she would never...
3537915 3539951 consciously betray the rebellion.
3540755 3541949 Terminate her immediately.
3545235 3546355 Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.
3546355 3547868 Cut in the sublight engines.
3550595 3552074 Whatthe...
3554795 3556875 We've come out ofhyperspace into a meteor shower.
3556875 3557910 Some kind of asteroid collision.
3557955 3559593 lt's not on any of the charts.
3559635 3560750 What"s going on?
3560795 3562831 Our position"s correct, except no Alderaan.
3562875 3563910 What do you mean? Where is it?
3563955 3565755 That"s what l'm trying to tell you, kid.
3565755 3566824 lt ain'tthere. lt's been totally blown away.
3566875 3567830 What? How?
3567875 3569752 Destroyed by the Empire.
3569795 3571831 The entire starfleet couldn"t destroy the whole planet.
3571915 3574270 lt would take 1,000 ships with more firepower than l've...
3575355 3576875 There's another ship coming in.
3576875 3577864 Maybe they know what happened.
3577915 3578950 lt's an imperial fighter.
3580835 3581824 lt followed us!
3581875 3583875 No. lt"s a short-range fighter.
3583875 3585866 There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come<br />from?
3588915 3590835 lt sure is leaving in a big hurry.
3590835 3591835 lf they identify us, we're in big trouble.
3591835 3592824 Not if l can help it.
3592875 3593875 Chewie, jam its transmissions.
3593875 3594830 lt would be as well to let it go.
3594875 3595830 lt's too far out of range.
3595875 3596910 Not for long.
3599875 3603875 Afighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its<br />own.
3603875 3606753 He must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or<br />something.
3606795 3607955 Well, he ain't gonna be around long enough...
3607955 3609229 to tell anybody about us.
3611835 3613746 Look at him. He's heading for that small moon.
3613795 3615911 l think l can get him before he gets there. He's almost in<br />range.
3617795 3619786 That's no moon.
3619835 3620904 lt's a space station.
3620955 3622866 lt's too big to be a space station.
3625915 3628748 l have a very bad feeling about this.
3628795 3629944 Turn the ship around.
3630755 3632746 Yeah. l think you're right. Full reverse!
3632795 3634831 Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
3638835 3640905 Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power!
3643755 3644915 Why are we still moving towards it?!
3644915 3646875 We're caught in a tractor beam. lt's pulling us in!
3646875 3648795 There's got to be something you can do!
3648795 3649864 There's nothing l can do about it, kid.
3649915 3650950 l'm at full power. l'm gonna have to shut down.
3651755 3652824 They"re not gonna get me without a fight.
3656955 3658752 You can'twin...
3658795 3660786 but there are alternatives to fighting.
3676755 3678791 Clear Bay 327.
3678835 3680871 We are opening the magnetic field.
3694875 3695910 To your stations!
3695955 3697752 Come with me.
3700955 3702832 Close all outboard shields.
3702875 3704831 Close all outboard shields.
3705915 3706904 Yes?
3706955 3708786 We've captured a freighter...
3708835 3709870 entering the remains ofthe Alderaan system.
3709915 3711826 lts markings match those of a ship...
3711875 3713955 that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
3713955 3717425 They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the<br />princess.
3717555 3720467 She may yet be of some use to us.
3725595 3728871 Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9. Release charge.
3730795 3732786 316, report to control.
3735795 3737751 There's no one on board, sir.
3737795 3739945 According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after<br />take-off.
3740715 3741909 lt must be a decoy, sir.
3741955 3743786 Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
3743835 3744790 Did you find any droids?
3744835 3745795 No, sir.
3745795 3747751 lf there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.
3747795 3748910 Send a scanning crew aboard.
3748955 3750866 l want every part of this ship checked.
3750915 3751870 Yes, sir.
3751915 3753755 l sense something...
3753755 3756713 a presence l've not felt since...
3758875 3760755 Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.
3760755 3761904 l want every part of this ship checked.
3770875 3772831 There's no one here.
3780915 3782871 Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
3782915 3784746 l use them for smuggling.
3784795 3785910 l never thought l'd be smuggling myself in 'em.
3785955 3787752 This is ridiculous.
3787795 3788830 Even ifl could take off...
3788875 3789944 l'd never get past the tractor beam.
3790755 3791824 Leave that to me.
3791875 3794753 Damn fool, l knew that you were gonna say that.
3794795 3795875 Who's the more foolish...
3795875 3797866 the fool or the fool who follows him?
3806715 3807784 The ship's all yours.
3807835 3809791 lf the scanners pick up anything...
3809835 3811746 report it immediately.
3811795 3813706 All right, let's go.
3827835 3828904 Hey, down there!
3830875 3832866 Could you give us a hand with this?
3840915 3840995 TK-421, why aren't you at your post?
3840995 3843873 TK-421, why aren't you at your post?
3843915 3845951 TK-421, do you copy?
3857915 3859826 Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
3859875 3861831 l'll see what l can do.
3877755 3879955 You know, between his howling and your blasting<br />everything in sight...
3879955 3882395 it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
3882395 3883635 Well bring them on!
3883635 3885785 l'd prefer a straightfight to all this sneakin" around.
3885835 3887791 We've found the computer outlet, sir.
3887835 3890713 Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire imperial<br />network.
3899915 3902835 He says he's found the main controls...
3902835 3904905 to the power beam that's holding the ship here.
3904955 3906946 He'll try to make the precise location appear on the<br />monitor.
3907755 3909871 The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor...
3909915 3911746 in seven locations.
3911795 3912864 A power loss at one ofthe terminals...
3912915 3915793 will allow the ship to leave.
3917075 3918755 l don"t think you boys can help.
3918755 3919904 l must go alone.
3919955 3921832 Whatever you say.
3921875 3923795 l've done more than l bargained for on this trip already.
3923795 3924910 l want to go with you.
3924955 3927708 Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids.
3927755 3928870 They must be delivered safely...
3928915 3931873 or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.
3931915 3935874 Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.
3938915 3942828 The Force will be with you always.
3951875 3953706 Boy, you said it, Chewie.
3953755 3956827 Where did you dig up that old fossil?
3956875 3958786 Ben is a great man.
3958835 3960955 Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
3960955 3962786 l didn't hear you give any ideas.
3962835 3963870 Well, anything's better than just hangin" around...
3963915 3964955 waiting for 'em to pick us up.
3964955 3965944 Who do you think...
3967235 3968304 What is it?
3968875 3970831 l'm afraid l'm not quite sure, sir.
3970875 3972945 He says ''l've found her'" and keeps repeating "'She's here.""
3973715 3975865 Well, who... who has he found?
3975915 3976870 Princess Leia.
3976915 3978195 The princess? She"s here?!
3978195 3979035 Princess?
3979035 3979995 Where? Where is she?
3979995 3981951 Princess? What"s going on?
3986875 3989912 Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.
3993915 3996755 l'm afraid she"s scheduled to be terminated.
3996755 3997710 Oh, no!
3998795 3999830 We've got to do something!
3999875 4001395 What are you talking about?
4001395 4002475 The droids belong to her.
4002475 4003385 She's the one in the message.
4003435 4004470 We got to help her.
4004515 4005504 Now look, don't get any funny ideas.
4005555 4007307 The old man wants us to wait right here.
4007355 4008424 But he didn"t know she was here.
4008475 4010466 lf we could just find a way back into that detention block.
4010515 4011470 l'm not going anywhere.
4011515 4012504 They"re going to execute her.
4012555 4014386 Look, a few minutes ago, you said...
4014435 4015390 you didn'twantto just wait here to be captured.
4015435 4016424 Now all you wantto do is stay?
4016475 4018352 Marching into the detention area...
4018395 4019384 is not what l had in mind.
4019435 4020424 But they're gonna kill her!
4020475 4022352 Better her than me.
4029515 4030550 She's rich.
4033435 4034470 Rich?
4034515 4036346 Mm-hmm. Rich, powerful.
4036395 4039353 Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
4039395 4040430 What?
4040475 4041915 Well, more well than you can imagine.
4041915 4043835 l don"t know. l can imagine quite a bit.
4043835 4044790 You'll get it.
4044875 4045864 l better.
4045955 4047104 You will.
4047635 4049785 All right, kid. You better be right about this.
4049835 4050506 All right.
4050555 4051465 What's your plan?
4051515 4052550 Um...
4052995 4055145 3PO, hand me those binders there, will you?
4056515 4057231 O.K.
4058515 4060506 Now... l'm gonna putthese on you.
4061955 4065152 O.K. Han, you... you put those on.
4065675 4066505 Don"t worry, Chewie.
4066555 4068386 l think l know what he has in mind.
4068435 4071347 Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking...
4071395 4073545 but what should R2 and l do ifwe're discovered here?
4074355 4075424 Lock the door.
4075475 4077511 And hope they don't have blasters.
4077555 4079432 That isn"t very reassuring.
4098875 4101105 517 to scanner control.
4101235 4103510 517 to scanner control.
4106955 4108911 316, report to control.
4112395 4114511 53 to upper bay door.
4114555 4117388 53 to upper bay door.
4129155 4131305 l can't see a thing in this helmet.
4160355 4162471 This is not gonna work.
4162515 4163504 Why didn"t you say so before?
4163555 4165511 l did say so before.
4180395 4183432 Where are you taking this... thing?
4183475 4186353 Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.
4186915 4188667 l wasn't notified.
4188955 4190946 l'll have to clear it.
4197235 4198270 Look out! He's loose!
4198315 4199270 He'll tear us all apart!
4199315 4200350 l'll get him!
4223035 4223751 Look out!
4233435 4236233 We gotta find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
4236275 4237344 Here it is... 2187.
4237395 4240228 You go and get her. l"ll hold them here.
4242475 4245273 Uh... Uh, everything"s under control.
4245315 4246350 Situation normal.
4246395 4247430 What happened?
4247475 4250273 Had a slight weapons malfunction...
4250315 4252306 but, uh, everything"s perfectly all right now.
4252355 4255267 We're fine... We"re all fine here now. Thank you.
4255315 4256304 How are you?
4256355 4258311 We're sending a squad up.
4258355 4259424 Uh, negative, negative!
4259475 4262308 We have a... a reactor leak here, uh, now.
4262355 4263344 Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
4263395 4265306 Uh, large leak, very dangerous.
4265355 4268233 Who is this? What's your operating number?
4268275 4269310 Uh...
4270355 4272075 Boring conversation anyway.
4272075 4274987 Luke! We're gonna have company!
4287315 4289385 Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
4289435 4290390 Huh?
4290435 4292266 Oh, the uniform.
4293435 4295426 l'm Luke Skywalker. l'm here to rescue you.
4295475 4296635 You're who?
4296635 4298353 l'm here to rescue you. l've got your R2 unit.
4298395 4299384 l'm here with Ben Kenobi.
4299435 4300435 Ben Kenobi?! Where is he?
4300435 4301424 Come on!
4303395 4305226 He is here.
4305275 4307311 Obi-Wan Kenobi?
4307355 4308390 What makes you think so?
4308435 4310635 Atremor in the Force.
4310635 4312307 The lasttime l felt it...
4312355 4314346 was in the presence of my old master.
4314395 4317228 Surely he must be dead by now.
4317275 4319425 Don"t underestimate the Force.
4320235 4321429 TheJedi are extinct.
4321475 4324228 Their fire has gone out of the universe.
4324275 4327312 You, myfriend, are all that's left of their religion.
4327355 4329232 Yes.
4329275 4330230 We have an emergency alert...
4330275 4332391 in Detention Block AA-23.
4332435 4333424 The princess?
4334235 4335270 Put all sections on alert.
4335315 4336430 Obi-Wan is here.
4336475 4338431 The Force is with him.
4338475 4339464 lf you're right...
4339955 4341434 he must not be allowed to escape.
4341835 4343314 Escape is not his plan.
4343355 4345266 l must face him alone.
4354075 4356066 Get behind me! Get behind me!
4366355 4367344 Watch your left.
4367395 4369272 They went down the cell bay.
4371395 4373226 Can't get out thatway.
4373275 4374390 Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
4374435 4377745 Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
4379275 4380344 C-3PO, C-3PO!
4380395 4381430 Yes, sir?
4381475 4383352 Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?
4383395 4385306 We've been cut off!
4387355 4389346 What was that? l didn't copy.
4389395 4392432 l said all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.
4392915 4395195 The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out.
4395195 4397390 All other information on your level is restricted.
4397435 4398834 Open up in there!
4398955 4400183 Open up in there!
4401275 4402424 Oh, no!
4402675 4404506 There isn't any other way out!
4409435 4411471 l can't hold them off forever! Now what?!
4412035 4413388 This is some rescue!
4413435 4415312 You came in here, and you didn"t have a plan for getting<br />out?
4415355 4417311 He's the brains, sweetheart!
4417355 4418390 Well, l didn't...
4420315 4421270 What the hell are you doing?
4421315 4423351 Somebody has to save our skins.
4425435 4427312 lnto the garbage chute, fly boy.
4434235 4435384 Get in there!
4436675 4438347 Get in there, you big furry oaf!
4438395 4439384 l don"t care what you smell.
4440035 4442344 Get in there, and don't worry about it.
4445235 4446350 Wonderful girl!
4448075 4449195 Either l'm going to kill her...
4449195 4450708 or l"m beginning to like her.
4452995 4454394 Get in there!
4462275 4462355 Ah!
4462355 4463265 Ah!
4466115 4469266 The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.
4469875 4472947 What an incredible smell you've discovered!
4475515 4477312 Let's get out of here.
4477355 4478390 Get awayfrom there.
4479035 4479990 No, wait!
4485835 4487268 Will you forget it?! l already tried it!
4487315 4488384 lt's magnetically sealed.
4488435 4490426 Putthat thing away! You're gonna get us all killed!
4490835 4492393 Absolutely, Your Worship.
4492435 4495233 Look, l had everything under control till you led us down<br />here!
4495275 4496390 Ya know, it's not gonna take 'em long...
4496435 4497835 to figure out what happened to us!
4497835 4499188 lt could be worse.
4503675 4504710 lt's worse.
4505035 4506354 There's something alive in here.
4506395 4507430 That's your imagination.
4508635 4510387 Something just moved past my leg.
4512315 4514306 Look! Did you see that?
4514355 4515265 What?
4535435 4536345 Kid!
4536395 4537350 Luke!
4538395 4539350 Luke!
4541275 4542310 Luke!
4548235 4551307 Luke! Luke, grab hold of this!
4551355 4553391 Blast it! My gun's jammed.
4553715 4554909 Where?
4555075 4556349 Anywhere!
4563955 4564910 Luke, Luke!
4587435 4589312 Help him!
4589355 4590344 What happened?
4590395 4591384 l don"t know.
4591435 4593426 lt just let go of me and disappeared.
4599475 4603354 l got a bad feeling aboutthis.
4607435 4608390 The walls are moving!
4608435 4609635 Don"t just stand there!
4609635 4612354 Try and brace itwith something.
4618955 4620434 Help me!
4632475 4633464 Wait a minute!
4636795 4638274 3PO!
4638315 4640351 Come in, 3PO!
4640395 4642272 3PO!
4642315 4644226 Where could he be?
4648355 4650311 Take over. See to him.
4652395 4654386 Look, there.
4656235 4657304 They"re madmen.
4657355 4658390 They"re heading for the prison level.
4658435 4660266 lf you hurry, you might catch them.
4660315 4661430 Follow me.
4665435 4667391 You stand guard.
4672035 4673104 Come on.
4676635 4677704 Oh!
4680915 4684305 All this excitement has overrun the circuits in my<br />counterpart here.
4684355 4687427 lf you don"t mind, l'd like to take him down to<br />maintenance.
4687475 4689306 All right.
4700435 4701390 3PO!
4701435 4703232 Come in, 3PO!
4703275 4704344 3PO!
4704395 4706226 Get on top!
4706275 4707264 l can't.
4707315 4710227 Where could he be?! 3PO!
4710275 4712266 3PO, will you come in!
4712315 4713350 They aren't here.
4713395 4714430 Something must have happened to them.
4715235 4716304 See ifthey've been captured.
4716355 4717310 Hurry.
4721075 4724033 One thing's for sure we're all gonna be a lot thinner.
4726315 4727555 Get on top of it.
4727555 4728670 l'm trying.
4734275 4735469 Thank goodness they haven"tfound them.
4736235 4737224 Where could they be?
4739355 4740470 ""Use the comlink''?
4741235 4743385 Oh, my. l forgot. l turned it off.
4746315 4748385 Are you there, sir?
4748435 4750346 3PO!
4750395 4751384 We've had some problems.
4751435 4752424 Will you shut up and listen to me?!
4753235 4754384 Shut down all the garbage mashers...
4754435 4755390 on the detention level, will ya?!
4755435 4756955 Do you copy!?
4756955 4759628 Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level!
4760475 4763308 Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level!
4763355 4765232 No! Shut them all down. Hurry!
4765715 4766431 Oh no.
4777115 4777467 What?
4778235 4779350 Ha ha!
4781355 4783346 Listen to them. They're dying, R2!
4783395 4785272 Curse my metal body!
4785315 4789228 l wasn't fast enough. lt's all my fault! My poor master.
4789275 4790390 We're all right! You did great!
4790435 4793233 Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch...
4793275 4795266 on unit number... Where are we?
4795315 4798352 3263827!
4841275 4844233 lf we can just avoid any more female advice...
4844275 4846266 we ought to be able to get outta here.
4846315 4847384 Well, let"s get moving.
4849075 4850394 Where are you going?
4850435 4851424 Aw...
4851475 4853306 No, wait! They"ll hear!
4854355 4856266 Come here, you big coward.
4856315 4857304 Chewie, come here.
4857355 4858390 Listen...
4858435 4861313 l don"t know who you are or where you came from...
4861355 4864267 but from now on, you do as l tell you, OK?
4864315 4866271 Look, Your Worshipfulness...
4866315 4868226 let's get one thing straight.
4868275 4870425 l take orders from just one person... me.
4871235 4872463 lt's a wonder you"re still alive.
4873235 4876272 Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
4876315 4879307 No reward is worth this.
4888235 4890226 Give me regular reports, please.
4890275 4891264 Right.
4893315 4894384 Do you know what's going on?
4894435 4896346 Maybe it"s another drill.
4901275 4902913 You seen that new VT-16?
4903235 4905271 Yeah. Some of the other guys were telling me about it.
4905315 4907306 They say it's... it's quite a thing to see...
4907355 4908549 What was that?
4909395 4911226 Ah, it's nothing. Outgassing.
4911275 4912264 Don"t worry about it.
4917355 4918310 There she is.
4918355 4919344 C-3PO? Do you copy?
4919395 4920384 Yes, sir.
4920435 4922346 -Are you safe?<br />- For the moment.
4922395 4924431 We're in the main hangar across from the ship.
4926435 4928312 We're right above you. Stand by.
4928355 4930232 You came in thatthing?
4930275 4931264 You're braver than l thought.
4931315 4932350 Nice! Come on.
4936395 4937305 lt's them!
4937355 4938344 Blast them!
4939355 4940344 Get back to the ship!
4940395 4942226 Where are you going? Come back!
4942275 4943230 He certainly has courage.
4943275 4944344 What good will it do us...
4944395 4946386 if he gets himself killed? Come on.
4946435 4950269 Aah!
4951395 4953431 Aah!
4969115 4970343 Whoop!
4970395 4973273 l think we took a wrong turn.
4977315 4978270 There's no lock.
4982235 4983270 That oughta hold them for a while.
4983315 4984430 Quick! We've got to get across.
4984475 4986352 Find the controls that extend the bridge.
4986395 4988226 l think ljust blasted it.
4988275 4989424 They"re coming through!
5011115 5012070 Here, hold this.
5028355 5029344 Here they come.
5040315 5041794 For luck.
5047155 5049305 We think they may be splitting up.
5049355 5052392 They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.
5065395 5066384 Where could they be?
5071315 5073271 Close the blast doors!
5080315 5082306 Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors!
5096955 5098991 l've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
5099035 5101026 We meet again at last.
5102275 5104515 The circle is now complete.
5104515 5106585 When l left you, l was but the learner.
5106635 5108591 Now l am the master.
5108635 5111593 Only a master of evil, Darth.
5132155 5134385 You should not have come back.
5134835 5136188 You can'twin, Darth.
5136475 5137995 lf you strike me down...
5137995 5141783 l shall become more powerful than you can possibly<br />imagine.
5163155 5165146 Your powers are weak, old man.
5173115 5175993 Didn't we just leave this party?
5177355 5178310 What kept you?
5178355 5179310 We, uh, ran into some old friends.
5179355 5180344 The ship all right?
5180395 5182306 lt seems OK, if we can get to it.
5182355 5184391 ljust hope the old man got the tractor beam out of<br />commission.
5198435 5199914 Look!
5202395 5204351 Come on, R2, we're going.
5206035 5207263 Now"s our chance! Go!
5210475 5211430 Ben?
5231235 5233112 No!
5240875 5241515 Come on!
5241515 5243073 Luke, come on!
5243115 5244184 Come on!
5244235 5245224 Luke, it's too late!
5245875 5247467 Blast the door, kid!
5256315 5259068 Run, Luke, run!
5261115 5263265 l hope that old man got that tractor beam out of<br />commission...
5263315 5266148 or this is gonna be a real short trip. O.K. Hit it!
5295995 5297986 We're coming up on their sentry ships.
5298035 5299184 Hold them off.
5299235 5303114 Angle the deflector shields while l charge up the main<br />guns.
5310195 5312265 l can't believe he"s gone.
5316195 5318265 There wasn't anything you could have done.
5318315 5321227 Come on, buddy. We"re not out of this yet.
5336595 5339553 You in, kid? OK, stay sharp.
5349515 5350504 Here they come.
5369555 5371466 They"re coming in too fast!
5377155 5378554 We've lost the lateral controls!
5378595 5380631 Don"t worry. She'll hold together.
5382515 5384471 Hear me, baby? Hold together.
5400555 5401510 Ha ha!
5405555 5407386 Got him! l got him!
5407435 5409471 Great, kid! Don"t get cocky.
5410555 5412432 There's still two more of them out there!
5444595 5446426 That's it! We did it!
5446475 5448466 We did it!
5448515 5450585 Help! l think l'm melting! This is all your fault!
5458515 5459550 Are they away?
5459595 5462587 They"ve just made the jump into hyperspace.
5462635 5467390 You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their<br />ship?
5467435 5469595 l'm taking an awful risk, Vader.
5469595 5471395 This had better work.
5475635 5478115 Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?
5478115 5481073 You know, sometimes l amaze even myself.
5481115 5483151 That doesn't sound too hard.
5483195 5484992 They let us go.
5485035 5486070 lt's the only explanation...
5486115 5487235 for the ease of our escape.
5487235 5488675 Easy? You call that easy?
5488675 5490028 They"re tracking us.
5490075 5491190 Not this ship, sister.
5491995 5495112 At least the information in R2 is still intact.
5495155 5497032 What's so important? What's he carrying?
5497075 5499987 The technical readouts ofthat battle station.
5500035 5502151 l only hope that when the data's analyzed...
5502195 5504026 a weakness can be found.
5504075 5505190 lt's not over yet.
5505235 5507112 lt is for me, sister.
5507155 5509066 Look, l ain"t in this for your revolution...
5509115 5511026 and l'm not in it for you, Princess.
5511075 5512110 l expect to be well paid.
5512155 5513144 l'm in it for the money.
5513195 5515151 You needn't worry about your reward.
5515195 5517072 lf money is all that you love...
5517115 5519185 then that"s what you"ll receive.
5521195 5523151 Your friend is quite a mercenary.
5523195 5525186 l wonder if he really cares about anything...
5525995 5527110 or anybody.
5527155 5528986 l care.
5535075 5537145 So...
5537195 5539026 what do you think of her, Han?
5539075 5540986 l'm trying not to, kid.
5541875 5542864 Good.
5546115 5549027 Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
5551075 5552144 l don't know. What do you think?
5552195 5554026 You think a princess and a guy like me...
5554075 5555986 No!
5602115 5603070 You're safe.
5603115 5604150 When we heard about Alderaan...
5604195 5605184 we feared the worst.
5605235 5607146 We have no time for sorrows, Commander.
5607195 5609106 You must use the information in this R2 unit...
5609155 5610110 to help plan the attack.
5610155 5611224 lt's our only hope.
5631755 5632435 Yes.
5632435 5634266 We're approaching the planet Yavin.
5634315 5636715 The rebel base is on a moon on the far side.
5636715 5638995 We are preparing to orbit the planet.
5638995 5639552 We are preparing to orbit the planet.
5646835 5648791 The battle station is heavily shielded...
5648835 5650746 and carries a firepower...
5650795 5652751 greater than half the starfleet.
5652795 5656834 lts defenses are designed around a direct large-scale<br />assault.
5656875 5661869 A small, one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the<br />outer defense.
5661915 5663906 Pardon me for asking, sir...
5663955 5666867 but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?
5666915 5670749 Well the Empire doesn't consider a small, one-man<br />fighter...
5670795 5671784 to be any threat...
5671835 5673951 or they'd have a tighter defense.
5674755 5676985 An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia...
5677755 5680792 has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
5680835 5682951 The approach will not be easy.
5683755 5686747 You're required to maneuver straight down this trench...
5686795 5689832 and skim the surface to this point.
5689875 5692753 The target area is only 2 meters wide.
5692795 5694786 lt's a small thermal exhaust port...
5694835 5696905 right below the main port.
5696955 5699947 The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.
5700755 5702871 A precise hit will start a chain reaction...
5702915 5704906 which should destroythe station.
5704955 5708834 Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.
5708875 5709910 The shaft is ray-shielded...
5709955 5711832 so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
5711875 5713945 That"s impossible, even for a computer.
5714235 5717830 But it"s not impossible. l used to bull's-eye womp rats in<br />my T-16 back home.
5717875 5719911 They"re not much bigger than 2 meters.
5719955 5723743 Then man your ships, and maythe Force be with you.
5730955 5733788 Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.
5733835 5735746 The moon with the rebel base...
5735795 5737831 will be in range in 30 minutes.
5737875 5739911 This will be a day long remembered.
5739955 5742788 lt has seen the end ofKenobi...
5742835 5746908 and will soon see the end of the rebellion.
5750755 5753144 All flight crews, man your stations.
5753835 5756793 All flight crews, man your stations.
5758875 5761833 So... you got your reward and you're just leaving, then?
5761875 5762990 That's right. Yeah.
5763755 5766906 l got some old debts l got to pay off with this stuff.
5766955 5768832 And even if l didn't...
5768875 5771753 you don't think l'd be fool enough to stick around here, do<br />ya?
5771795 5772910 Why don't you come with us?
5772955 5774866 You're pretty good in a fight. We could use ya.
5774915 5777873 Come on. Why don't you take a look around?
5777915 5778950 You know what"s about to happen...
5778995 5780792 what they're up against.
5780835 5781824 They could use a good pilot like you.
5781875 5782990 You're turning your back on them.
5783755 5785825 What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
5785875 5787786 Besides, attacking that battle station...
5787835 5788824 ain"t my idea of courage.
5788875 5791787 lt's more like... suicide.
5792875 5793830 All right.
5793875 5795911 Take care of yourself, Han.
5795955 5798788 l guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
5798835 5799904 Hey, Luke.
5802955 5805753 Maythe Force be with you.
5811835 5812870 What are you looking at?
5812915 5814826 l know what l"m doing.
5818915 5821304 All pilots to your stations.
5821995 5823951 All pilots to your stations.
5829635 5830829 What's wrong?
5830875 5831944 Oh, it's Han.
5832275 5834743 l don"t know. l really thought he'd change his mind.
5834795 5835910 He's got to follow his own path.
5835955 5837911 No one can choose itfor him.
5838955 5841913 l only wish Ben were here.
5848915 5850315 Open main launch tubes.
5850315 5850872 Open main launch tubes.
5851915 5853826 Main launch tubes opening, sir.
5853915 5854870 Hey, Luke!
5855235 5855906 Biggs!
5855955 5857832 l don"t believe it. How are you?
5857875 5858830 -Great.<br />-How'd you get here?
5858875 5859830 Hey, you coming up with us?
5859875 5860910 l'll be right up there with you...
5860955 5862115 and have l got stories to tell you.
5862115 5862706 Skywalker....
5864315 5866395 Are you sure you can handle this ship?
5866395 5868829 Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot...
5868875 5870752 in the outer-rim territories.
5870795 5871784 You'll do all right.
5871835 5872870 Thank you, sir. l'll try.
5872915 5874315 l gotta get aboard.
5874315 5875873 We'll hear all your stories when we get back, all right?
5875915 5876870 All right.
5876915 5877904 Hey, Biggs.
5877955 5879752 l told you l'd make it someday.
5879795 5880750 lt'll be like old times, Luke.
5880795 5881944 They"ll never stop us.
5884955 5886866 Hey, this R2 unit of yours seems a bit beat up.
5886915 5887870 You want a new one?
5887915 5889792 Not on your life.
5889835 5890904 That little droid and l have been through a lot together.
5890955 5891910 You OK, R2?
5893875 5894830 Good.
5895955 5898947 Gold squadron, begin take-off procedure.
5899635 5901865 Hang on tight, R2. You"ve got to come back.
5903915 5905906 You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
5952755 5956748 Luke, the Force will be with you.
5966795 5967864 Standby alert.
5967915 5969906 Death Star approaching.
5969955 5972947 Estimated time to firing range, 15 minutes.
5985875 5986910 All wings report in.
5986955 5987865 Red 10 standing by.
5987915 5988904 Red Seven standing by.
5988955 5989944 Red Three standing by.
5989995 5991747 Red Six standing by.
5991795 5992864 Red Nine standing by.
5992915 5993870 Red Two standing by.
5993915 5994904 Red 11 standing by.
5994955 5996866 Red Five standing by.
5997955 5999911 Lock S-foils in attack position.
6003955 6005866 We're passing through the magnetic field.
6005915 6006950 Hold tight.
6006995 6009987 Switch your deflectors on. Double front.
6012955 6014866 Look at the size of that thing!
6014915 6017748 Cut the chatter, Red Two. Accelerate to attack speed.
6020835 6021824 This is it, boys.
6021875 6023752 Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
6023795 6024784 l copy, Gold Leader.
6024835 6025950 We're starting for the target shaft now.
6025995 6026950 We're in position.
6027315 6028748 l'm going to cut across the axis...
6028795 6029784 and try and draw their fire.
6043435 6044914 Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.
6044955 6046786 l see it. Stay low.
6054715 6055784 This is Red Five. l'm going in.
6059475 6060794 Luke, pull up!
6061955 6062944 Are you all right?
6062995 6064747 l got a little cooked, but l'm O.K.
6069915 6071792 We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader...
6071835 6072824 but they're so small...
6072875 6073864 they're evading our turbolasers.
6073915 6075871 We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.
6075915 6077871 Getthe crews to their fighters.
6080475 6082750 Watch yourself. There's a lot of fire coming...
6082795 6084751 from the right side of that deflection tower.
6084795 6085750 l'm on it.
6085795 6087751 l'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
6087795 6088830 l'm right with you, Red Three.
6094875 6095910 l've got a problem here.
6096395 6096907 Eject.
6096955 6097910 l can hold it.
