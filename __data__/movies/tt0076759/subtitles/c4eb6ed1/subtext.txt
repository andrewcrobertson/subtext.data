13182 16019 GEORGE LUCAS:<br /><i>My original inspiration on this film...</i>
16102 19564 <i>was really to use mythological motifs...</i>
19647 21399 <i>to create a whole new...</i>
21941 23610 <i>kind of myth...</i>
23902 25653 <i>that was very updated<br />and contemporary.</i>
25904 29157 <i>So I used the Saturday matinee serial<br />as my vessel...</i>
29240 33453 <i>to put this barrel<br />of mythological motifs together.</i>
41128 44256 GARY KURTZ:<br /><i>I first met George</i>
44340 46091 <i>actually through Francis Coppola.</i>
46175 49595 <i>Francis and I go way back<br />to the Roger Corman days.</i>
49678 53140 <i>We worked on several Roger Corman<br />low-budget pictures together.</i>
53224 56310 <i>We went out to Mill Valley<br />to meet George, who was editing</i> THX...
56393 59063 <i>because George was going to<br />direct</i> Apocalypse.
59146 61899 <i>And then a few months later,<br />we realized that Columbia</i>
61982 63317 <i>really was not interested...</i>
63400 67948 <i>in doing a film about the Vietnam War<br />while the war was still going on.</i>
68031 71117 <i>So the project kind of<br />got put on the back burner,</i>
71201 74329 <i>and George talked about<br />his rock-and-roll musical,</i>
74412 76248 <i>which eventually became</i><br />American Graffiti.
76331 78458 <i>We made that for Universal.</i>
78542 83296 <i>And all during this time,<br />he was talking about Flash Gordon...</i>
83380 86967 <i>and the fact that he would like to do<br />a Flash Gordon kind of</i>
87050 89469 <i>1930s space opera.</i>
89553 95977 <i>And after</i> American Graffiti<br /><i>did pretty well at the box office,</i>
96060 98187 <i>we made the rounds of the studios.</i>
98271 104485 <i>In the late '70s, science fiction seemed<br />to be all about apocalyptic societies...</i>
104569 108322 <i>and death and destruction<br />and not very inspiring.</i>
108406 112535 <i>Plus the fact that</i> 2001,<br /><i>which had come out in 1968...</i>
113077 115204 <i>was a big critical, cult hit...</i>
115288 117206 <i>but not very financially successful.</i>
117290 119292 <i>So we were fighting an uphill battle</i>
119375 121711 <i>with a science fiction project,<br />completely.</i>
137102 139313 LUCAS: <i>The opening shot<br />we shot several times.</i>
139396 142065 <i>The model that was built<br />was a little bit on the small side.</i>
142149 144151 <i>So it was very hard to get the shot<br />that I wanted,</i>
144234 146361 <i>which was this huge, huge ship<br />going over...</i>
147696 149282 <i>that just went on for miles.</i>
149365 151552 <i>And normally if you were doing that,<br />you would build a model</i>
151576 153703 <i>that was 10 or 12 feet long.</i>
153786 155246 [DENNIS MUREN SPEAKING]
155330 157248 <i>This opening shot<br />was shot by Richard Edlund.</i>
157332 159372 <i>The model was made by<br />the crack ILM model shop team.</i>
159417 162104 <i>They had a whole bunch of guys under<br />the supervision of Grant McCune.</i>
162128 164631 <i>And this model is really<br />only about three feet long.</i>
164714 168217 <i>But Richard came up with a way<br />to make it look much, much longer.</i>
168301 170553 <i>The model is<br />almost touching the camera,</i>
170637 172555 <i>and the camera<br />is moving over the model.</i>
172639 175308 <i>It's all upside down,<br />and it just looks massive.</i>
175391 177394 [RICHARD EDLUND SPEAKING]
177478 179438 <i>I went to see the movie<br />at the Chinese Theater.</i>
179521 181625 <i>And with that shot-<br />which I always felt, by the way...</i>
181649 185194 <i>was one of the most important shots<br />in the movie for the visual effects.</i>
185277 188530 <i>Because if the audience bought<br />that shot, you had them.</i>
188614 192034 <i>And if you failed with that shot,<br />you lost them.</i>
192117 195788 <i>And with Johnny Williams's music,<br />which was a masterstroke...</i>
196080 200209 <i>I sat back in awe<br />of the material that we had done.</i>
201210 203253 MUREN: <i>The opening there<br />that the ship's going into</i>
203379 205215 <i>is only about four or five inches long.</i>
205298 207443 <i>And the ship that's going into it,<br />photographed separately,</i>
207467 208843 <i>is six feet long.</i>
214683 216184 [BEN BURTT SPEAKING]
216267 217644 <i>My involvement began...</i>
217727 219938 <i>nine months before<br />they actually went into</i>
220021 222440 <i>the shooting of the film, in 1975.</i>
222524 225402 <i>I was just graduating<br />from USC film school</i>
225485 228238 <i>when I got a call from Gary Kurtz.</i>
228321 232076 <i>They were looking for someone<br />to go out and gather sound effects...</i>
232159 236414 <i>that they could use as a library<br />of material for the production.</i>
236497 239166 <i>So it was a very unusual circumstance.</i>
239250 243087 <i>The habit in Hollywood<br />was not to bring sound people-</i>
243170 245548 <i>sound editors or sound mixers-</i>
245631 250886 <i>onto a production until the picture<br />had actually been finished in editing.</i>
251137 252888 <i>But George wanted something different.</i>
253139 256308 <i>He wanted a very customized,<br />very special soundtrack.</i>
256392 258520 <i>Not the kind of track that you'd get...</i>
258603 262482 <i>by just pulling effects<br />from a library of prerecorded sound.</i>
262566 265902 <i>He wanted someone to go out<br />and gather and develop</i>
265986 267654 <i>specific sounds for the film.</i>
268905 270657 <i>Once I read the script,</i>
270741 273410 <i>I realized there were<br />hundreds of items in the film,</i>
273493 276163 <i>everything from<br />ambiances to weapons...</i>
276246 279875 <i>to alien voices to the voice of R2-D2.</i>
280167 283170 <i>And I asked George Lucas whether<br />he wanted me</i>
283295 285256 <i>to gather sounds<br />for everything in the script.</i>
285339 290178 <i>And they said, "Sure, go ahead." And<br />they sent me a Nagra tape recorder-</i>
290261 293181 <i>it's a portable tape recorder-<br />along with a few microphones.</i>
293639 295558 <i>And I was just turned loose to go out</i>
295641 299270 <i>and gather sound by myself<br />for about a year.</i>
303858 305902 <i>Most of the spaceships,<br />like the Blockade Runner</i>
305985 307445 <i>at the beginning of the film-</i>
307528 310364 <i>It turned out that<br />using World War II warbirds</i>
310448 312409 <i>and slowing the sound down a lot...</i>
312493 316413 <i>gave a visceral, pass-by quality<br />which worked well.</i>
316497 319541 <i>And sometimes I would add<br />an explosion or a thunderclap...</i>
319625 322711 <i>or even an animal roar, like a lion,</i>
322795 326340 <i>underneath the sound of<br />the airplane pass-by...</i>
326423 329343 <i>to give it an additional characteristic.</i>
330844 333806 CARRIE FISHER:<br /><i>The lip gloss that I had on,</i>
333889 335766 <i>that I magically had-</i>
335849 339479 <i>Through every battle,<br />the gloss was there.</i>
339562 341981 <i>I'm anti-gloss now, but it's too late.</i>
354410 356496 MARK HAMILL:<br /><i>I said to him, "Are you gonna</i>"
356579 357848 <i>cut to two people on the ship...</i>
357872 359499 <i>when Vader first appears...</i>
359582 360935 <i>and say, 'Oh, it's the Dark Lord<br />of the Sith.</i>
360959 362502 <i>"He's this, that and the other'?"</i>
362585 364212 <i>"He said," No, he's all in black.</i>
364295 367633 <i>We'll do a sting of scary music,<br />and everybody will know."</i>
367716 370427 <i>And I think that was<br />one of the best things they did...</i>
370511 374890 <i>was let the audience bring to it<br />what they want to bring to it...</i>
374974 379895 <i>rather than us laying out every<br />aspect of what we were trying to do.</i>
383732 385776 RALPH McQUARRIE: <i>For R2, I was looking</i>
385860 387278 <i>for something different...</i>
387361 391574 <i>than the little robots that were done<br />for</i> Silent Running...
391657 393910 <i>that Doug Trumbull had done.</i>
393994 397038 <i>They were square,<br />and I knew that our robots</i>
397122 399958 <i>would be compared to their robots.</i>
400792 402669 <i>Because George had talked<br />about them.</i>
402752 405839 <i>He'd said, "Well, you know<br />the little robots in</i> Silent Running <i>?"</i>
405922 409676 <i>He wanted a little worker robot<br />like that for R2-D2.</i>
409759 414389 <i>And I thought, instead of a box,<br />I'll make him a can-</i>
414472 417392 <i>a cylinder with a dome on top.</i>
417475 421480 <i>That was my first thought,<br />just strictly in the sense...</i>
421564 425693 <i>that I didn't want him<br />to look like the</i> Silent Running <i>robots.</i>
425776 430531 <i>They had two legs, so I thought<br />we could give R2 three legs.</i>
431616 435494 <i>The first one I did,<br />I think he had a spherical bottom,</i>
435578 437413 <i>like a ball bearing<br />that would roll around.</i>
437496 440541 <i>He had gyroscopes in him<br />so he didn't fall over.</i>
440625 442811 <i>And he just leaned into<br />whatever direction he wanted to do...</i>
442835 446631 <i>and spun his single wheel,<br />which was really a sphere.</i>
446714 448675 <i>Which sounded pretty interesting...</i>
449134 451803 <i>but very difficult to do in reality.</i>
451887 456516 <i>And I put little panels on him<br />and places for arms to come out.</i>
456600 459353 <i>I knew he had to have<br />a lot of little gadgets,</i>
459436 462439 <i>that he was kinda like<br />a Swiss Army knife.</i>
462522 464107 <i>And he had to have lights,</i>
464232 465984 <i>and he had to have<br />lenses to see through.</i>
466985 470364 <i>He had to have color<br />to distinguish him from another robot.</i>
470447 472407 <i>So I found places to put blue.</i>
488424 490093 FISHER:<br /><i>I hated that hairstyle.</i>
490343 494472 <i>But I thought they were gonna fire me<br />and bring in Jodie Foster...</i>
494555 496599 <i>and just let me be killed in a stunt.</i>
496683 498893 <i>So when I came in<br />with the terrible hairstyle...</i>
498977 501854 <i>and he said,<br />"It's good. What do you think of it?"</i>
501938 503983 <i>I said, "Fantastic."</i>
505442 508070 <i>It doesn't matter<br />that they changed my hairstyle.</i>
508153 512908 <i>That first one-<br />It's inflammable. It's indestructible.</i>
512992 518831 <i>That's the hairstyle that will follow me,<br />well, to everyone's grave.</i>
522626 525587 LUCAS: <i>Part of being a successful<br />filmmaker is that you get an idea,</i>
525671 528382 <i>you fall in love with the idea,<br />and you're very tenacious</i>
528465 530051 <i>about making sure it gets done.</i>
530135 532137 <i>And you will get it done<br />no matter what happens...</i>
532387 535265 <i>and no matter what circumstances<br />you have to do it under.</i>
535724 538518 <i>It was partially an experiment in<br />making a Hollywood-style movie.</i>
538601 540061 <i>I'd never done it before.</i>
540145 542665 <i>I'd been an independent filmmaker<br />and made movies on the streets,</i>
542689 544399 <i>with a really small crew.</i>
544482 546651 <i>I'd sort of become interested in the idea</i>
546735 548528 <i>of what it was like<br />to actually have sets...</i>
548611 551906 <i>and to shoot on a sound stage<br />and do something that was a fantasy...</i>
551990 553742 <i>that didn't have any basis in reality.</i>
553825 555869 <i>And then I had a lot<br />of other motivations of</i>
555952 558539 <i>wanting to tell a young person's movie,</i>
558622 562585 <i>to base it on mythology and to do<br />things very, very old-fashioned.</i>
562668 566047 <i>It's an old-fashioned movie<br />based on an old-fashioned idea.</i>
578601 581103 ROBERT WATTS:<br /><i>It seemed like an interesting film.</i>
581187 583668 <i>I had read the script.<br />It sounded like nothing I'd done before.</i>
583732 586485 <i>I'd touched science fiction because I did</i>
586568 589613 2001: A Space Odyssey<br /><i>with Stanley Kubrick.</i>
589696 591490 <i>But this was very different...</i>
591573 593408 <i>because it didn't obey<br />the rules of space</i>
593492 596912 <i>that we had been<br />so rigid about in</i> 2001.
596995 600207 LUCAS: <i>The most successful science<br />fiction film up to that point was</i> 2001.
600499 605212 <i>And successful then was that it made<br />about $24 million or something like that.</i>
605504 609466 <i>Most hit science fiction films<br />would make about $16 million,</i>
609549 612095 <i>which was the</i> Planet of the Apes <i>films<br />and that sort of thing.</i>
612178 614764 <i>But most science fiction films<br />would make under $10 million.</i>
614847 617642 <i>There was no reason to think<br />that it would do any different.</i>
621229 623022 ANTHONY DANIELS:<br /><i>One of the reasons that</i>
623106 625149 <i>George wanted to see me<br />all those years ago...</i>
625233 627819 <i>to get inside a metal suit<br />that had yet to be built...</i>
627902 630863 <i>was that then, as hopefully now,<br />I have quite a slender frame.</i>
630947 632824 <i>I have to work on it more these days.</i>
632907 634826 <i>But that was one of the criteria,</i>
634909 637036 <i>because otherwise the suit<br />would end up being huge...</i>
637120 639206 <i>if it went on a regular-sized person.</i>
639289 642543 <i>And the other qualification,<br />apart from being an actor,</i>
642626 646004 <i>was that I'd, for a long time,<br />especially when I was at drama school,</i>
646088 650926 <i>developed an interest in the art of<br />mime, which is so boring on its own.</i>
651009 653971 <i>But what it is is kind of bodily control<br />and technique.</i>
654054 658559 <i>And George got that that was<br />the sort of person you might need...</i>
658642 660769 <i>to create this type of role.</i>
675160 679706 <i>And then with 3PO, eventually the mime<br />and the acting and the voice...</i>
679789 681791 <i>all came together<br />in a kind of weird...</i>
682250 683835 <i>configuration.</i>
683918 685128 NORMAN REYNOLDS:<br /><i>With R2-D2,</i>
685211 686588 <i>we actually had that made...</i>
686671 688882 <i>by a small company<br />at Shepperton Studios.</i>
688965 694013 <i>And he arrived white with blue panels,<br />and the aluminum panels.</i>
694096 696599 <i>We were all very proud of him.<br />It really looked wonderful.</i>
696682 698601 <i>And George said we have to make him-</i>
698684 701937 <i>something like, make him live<br />or make him real or something,</i>
702021 703898 <i>and we have to age him.</i>
703981 706621 <i>That's what we did. The paint<br />department and the prop department...</i>
706692 708569 <i>sort of beat him up really.</i>
708652 711572 <i>And he said, "That's how it should be.<br />That's how it should be."</i>
711655 713616 <i>And that set the trend for the movie.</i>
713699 717620 <i>And all of that really was,<br />I have to say, entirely down to George.</i>
717703 721750 <i>'Cause that's the way that he envisaged<br />the movie looking really.</i>
722626 724419 KENNY BAKER:<br /><i>My agent said to me,</i>
724502 726296 <i>"There's a guy in town called Lucas,</i>
726379 729132 <i>and he's looking for somebody<br />to go inside a robot."</i>
729216 733303 <i>They've made the prototype already,<br />and they couldn't find anyone...</i>
733386 736806 <i>that would fit inside it to make it move.</i>
736890 739893 <i>And they couldn't use kids 'cause it<br />was quite a heavy machine, you know.</i>
739976 742395 <i>Weighed about 80 pounds at least.</i>
742646 744246 <i>"They want you to go down there<br />and see."</i>
744314 746274 <i>I didn't know what it was all about,<br />to be honest.</i>
746316 748903 <i>"They want you to go down<br />to the special effects department...</i>
748986 751239 <i>in Harlesden-northwest London."</i>
751322 753157 <i>I think that's where I first saw it.</i>
753241 755868 <i>I went down there,<br />and I just walked into this room</i>
755952 757745 <i>and they all went,<br />"Yes. He'll do."</i>
766837 771759 FISHER:<br /><i>So sometimes that was a human-</i>
774012 778684 <i>Kenny Baker-<br />and sometimes it was whatever it was.</i>
782104 785190 WATTS: Norman <i>Reynolds, who was<br />the art director under John Barry-</i>
785274 789695 <i>was later to become the designer on</i><br />The Empire Strikes Back-
789778 794700 <i>personally had to come to Tunisia<br />'cause he had overseen C-3PO...</i>
794783 796285 <i>and it was ready the first day.</i>
796368 799454 <i>R2-D2 didn't really function that well.</i>
799705 802166 <i>He could run along<br />in the three-legged position,</i>
802250 805211 <i>but he couldn't turn his head<br />at the same time.</i>
806212 808423 BAKER:<br /><i>They developed this with a third leg.</i>
808715 814012 <i>It worked up to a point, but it just<br />sort of sat back and took off smoothly,</i>
814095 817015 <i>whereas I'm always jiggling around<br />in my robot.</i>
817890 820351 <i>It's the same size as me really.<br />The problem was the feet.</i>
820435 821894 <i>That was the problem.</i>
821978 823313 <i>I could get into it. That's easy.</i>
823396 826149 <i>You just take off the head<br />like a boiled egg...</i>
826232 827817 <i>and then just drop me in.</i>
827900 829945 <i>I couldn't get in myself.</i>
830029 834074 <i>Just lower me down slowly.<br />I'd try and work my feet into the feet...</i>
834158 836243 <i>at an angle of 45 degrees,</i>
836327 839288 <i>and then flat feet,<br />which was very uncomfortable.</i>
841498 844877 BURTT: <i>A lot of the attempts<br />at doing R2-D2's voice,</i>
844960 847087 <i>the outtakes, so to speak,<br />ended up being the voices</i>
847171 848881 <i>of other robots in the film.</i>
848964 850716 <i>The binocular robot.</i>
850799 854261 <i>The various other R2 units<br />on board the sandcrawler.</i>
854345 858016 <i>So most of the material that I generated<br />got used somewhere in the film.</i>
858099 861770 <i>It just became robots<br />of less importance.</i>
867317 869986 BAKER:<br /><i>There were sharp edges everywhere.</i>
870070 873823 <i>And nuts and bolts and things<br />sticking out everywhere.</i>
873907 877285 <i>It was very uncomfortable,<br />very claustrophobic.</i>
877369 879746 <i>There were wires everywhere.</i>
879829 881414 <i>And they said,<br />"Can you move the head?"</i>
881498 886170 <i>The head was on ball bearings-<br />on a track of ball bearings.</i>
886253 889340 <i>I used to grab whatever<br />I could grab a hold of...</i>
889423 891425 <i>and turn it physically<br />that way and that way.</i>
891509 896389 <i>Not very far. Because if I went too far,<br />the wires would go around my neck.</i>
908526 910570 BURTT: <i>The Jawa voices<br />and their development...</i>
910821 916243 <i>became the prototype for how we would<br />develop languages and alien voices...</i>
916326 919287 <i>for those characters in the films<br />that were not electronic...</i>
919371 922791 <i>but they spoke<br />an actual organic tongue.</i>
922874 928004 <i>And I listened to a lot of language tapes<br />from around the world.</i>
928088 932426 <i>And out of that<br />came samples of languages,</i>
932509 935011 <i>real languages, which sounded<br />very exotic</i>
935095 937974 <i>and they weren't recognizable<br />as something familiar.</i>
938057 940643 <i>But like any real language,<br />they come with their...</i>
941185 945022 <i>unique historic<br />and cultural details...</i>
945106 948067 <i>that are usually developed<br />over a long period of time.</i>
949026 952447 <i>I was listening to a lot<br />of different African languages,</i>
952530 955241 <i>and Zulu came up in a recording.</i>
955324 958911 <i>And in listening to it, I thought<br />that this might be a good basis...</i>
958995 962081 <i>for the Jawa language for a start.</i>
994949 1000663 <i>And we located a man who spoke Zulu<br />in the Los Angeles area...</i>
1000914 1002415 <i>and brought him into the studio.</i>
1002499 1007420 <i>I did a whole recording session with<br />him, had him try out different voices.</i>
1007504 1010924 <i>He was not an actor,<br />but he was directable,</i>
1011007 1015220 <i>and he knew his native tongue<br />very well.</i>
1015303 1019558 <i>I ended up having him tell me stories,<br />and I had conversation with him,</i>
1019642 1025189 <i>and I got him to give me a range<br />of emotional responses-</i>
1025272 1029443 <i>to ask questions, to make declarations,</i>
1029527 1031487 <i>to give me different phrases.</i>
1031570 1036575 <i>And out of that, I extracted<br />from those recordings bits and pieces.</i>
1036659 1040913 <i>And once I got the Jawa sounds<br />under development...</i>
1040996 1046461 <i>I was then able to take them further<br />by imitating the Zulu myself...</i>
1046545 1049381 <i>and getting another friend<br />named Rick Victor together,</i>
1049464 1051216 <i>and we actually went out into the rocks.</i>
1051299 1053260 <i>We went out to Vasquez Rocks,</i>
1053343 1056346 <i>a famous location<br />north of Los Angeles...</i>
1056429 1059266 <i>where we could get<br />good echoes and reflections.</i>
1063687 1068066 <i>We went out into the rocks<br />and did other recordings of Jawas...</i>
1068149 1071236 <i>so that they actually sounded like<br />they were really outside.</i>
1071319 1074198 <i>By blending the studio recordings<br />in Zulu...</i>
1074282 1080204 <i>with the manufactured<br />double-talk Zulu done in the studio...</i>
1080288 1083666 <i>as well as on exterior locations,</i>
1083749 1089171 <i>we were able to fabricate<br />a little culture of Jawa voices.</i>
1094594 1097972 LUCAS:<br /><i>This scene here, buying the droids,</i>
1098055 1102603 <i>was actually the first scene we shot<br />when we shot the movie.</i>
1111695 1115157 DANIELS: <i>We sat there, George and I,<br />on the second interview,</i>
1115240 1116700 <i>and we talked about robots.</i>
1116783 1122080 <i>We talked about how the suit might be.</i>
1122164 1124124 <i>And it was gonna be pretty much...</i>
1124207 1127170 <i>as much as Ralph McQuarrie's painting<br />could be made physically.</i>
1127253 1130131 <i>It meant I immediately<br />had to go to Elstree Studios.</i>
1130214 1136137 <i>A room covered in polythene,<br />and two workmen in overalls...</i>
1136220 1138640 <i>and buckets, bags of plaster.</i>
1138723 1142101 <i>And I stood there with no clothes on...</i>
1142185 1145521 <i>being slapped with buckets<br />of plaster of Paris.</i>
1145605 1149400 <i>Truly one of the most<br />disgusting experiences of my life.</i>
1149484 1152153 <i>It took days to get it out of my system.</i>
1152236 1158243 <i>And what resulted then was this<br />absolutely appalling copy of my body.</i>
1159453 1162456 <i>It was revolting. I just looked awful.</i>
1162539 1165584 <i>'Cause you don't get to<br />stand outside yourself that often.</i>
1165668 1168837 <i>It kind of hung around the studio<br />for a while, to my chagrin.</i>
1169088 1171715 <i>I was like, "Please, don't look."</i><br />[CHUCKLES]
1171799 1175094 <i>The process continued<br />from this body cast.</i>
1175177 1177030 <i>This is where it began to get<br />really kind of nice,</i>
1177054 1179098 <i>because the sculptor, Liz Moore,</i>
1179181 1180599 <i>began to create in clay-</i>
1181142 1182782 <i>using my body as the matrix, if you like-</i>
1182811 1187440 <i>created the shape that was eventually<br />gonna become 3PO as you recognize it.</i>
1187524 1190151 <i>And she was just terrific.</i>
1193113 1195365 <i>One day I walked in,<br />and there were these row of heads,</i>
1195448 1198201 <i>like some kind of terrible<br />execution scene.</i>
1198284 1200203 <i>All sorts of different things.</i>
1200286 1202872 <i>Liz had used all her art<br />to bring this character alive.</i>
1203123 1206084 <i>And George said,<br />"Which one do you like?"</i>
1206167 1210548 <i>And the one I didn't like-<br />you know, that one-</i>
1210631 1213175 <i>George said,<br />"Oh, that's the one I chose."</i>
1214343 1219515 <i>And the terrible, terrible truth was that<br />eventually, before it ever got filmed,</i>
1219598 1223853 <i>Liz was killed in a car crash<br />and never saw her creation.</i>
1224145 1226480 <i>I kind of hope there's<br />some great screening room</i>
1226647 1228691 <i>in the sky where she's saying<br />"I did that."</i>
1245167 1246710 WATTS:<br /><i>It was a scramble.</i>
1246793 1252632 <i>C-3PO was finally put together<br />for the very first time...</i>
1252716 1255343 <i>the day before we started shooting.</i>
1255427 1257846 <i>If you like, almost that morning.</i>
1257929 1261516 DANIELS: <i>And the night before, far<br />from having rehearsals and cameras...</i>
1261600 1263686 <i>and everything to help me,</i>
1263770 1268900 <i>I was sitting on the edge of my bed<br />in this, I have to say, scuzzy hotel.</i>
1270693 1273571 <i>There were no other hotels.<br />They only did scuzzy back then.</i>
1273654 1278826 <i>Okay. Alec Guinness was in another<br />hotel, which was meant to be grand...</i>
1278910 1280578 <i>but I think was more scuzzy.</i>
1280661 1282806 <i>'Cause he was the one who<br />ended up with food poisoning,</i>
1282830 1285124 <i>so I think, hey-</i> [CHUCKLES]
1285208 1288461 <i>And I'm sitting on the edge of my bed<br />with Maxie, my dresser.</i>
1288544 1290756 <i>Maxie was from props.</i>
1291632 1295219 <i>So right at the beginning,<br />I began to get the idea...</i>
1295302 1297846 <i>that maybe I wasn't quite an actor,<br />mm-hmm-</i>
1297930 1299765 <i>or at least that was the way<br />I was viewed-</i>
1299848 1304978 <i>that this costume could not be run<br />by somebody from wardrobe.</i>
1305270 1308607 <i>Wardrobe don't do heavy metal.<br />They don't do fiberglass.</i>
1308690 1310609 <i>They don't do aluminum.</i>
1310692 1312861 <i>They do silk. They do cotton.</i>
1312945 1316615 <i>But there we were that night<br />sitting on my bed, Maxie and me,</i>
1316699 1319577 <i>gluing the hands together.</i>
1326000 1327961 BURTT: <i>A lot of the electronic<br />backgrounds</i>
1328044 1329629 <i>that are used throughout the film-</i>
1329712 1333341 <i>the telemetry,<br />the radio sounds you hear low level,</i>
1333424 1336636 <i>which make this place seem alive<br />and kind of futuristic-</i>
1336719 1339556 <i>came from recordings<br />off an old shortwave radio...</i>
1339639 1343768 <i>that belonged to my grandfather,<br />built in the 1930s.</i>
1343853 1347273 <i>It seems as though it received sound<br />that nobody else could get.</i>
1347356 1349692 <i>And I used to dial around<br />and be fascinated</i>
1349775 1352820 <i>by all the electronic noise and signals...</i>
1352903 1355865 <i>that seemed to be coming from space<br />or somewhere in the atmosphere.</i>
1355948 1359326 <i>And I had recorded<br />some of the shortwave sounds</i>
1359410 1361495 <i>as a teenager and saved the tapes.</i>
1361579 1364832 <i>And when it came to developing<br />a lot of the ambiances for</i> Star Wars,
1364915 1367960 <i>I went back through those old<br />shortwave radio recordings...</i>
1368043 1371548 <i>and pulled out<br />little snippets of sound here and there...</i>
1371631 1374593 <i>and ran it at different speeds<br />and put it through echo chambers...</i>
1374676 1377679 <i>and had a lot of fun building<br />the telemetry backgrounds...</i>
1377762 1380473 <i>which are part<br />of the fabric of</i> Star Wars.
1384394 1387814 HAMILL:<br /><i>I understood who Luke had to be...</i>
1387898 1391818 <i>mostly when I wanted to edge my way<br />into Han Solo territory...</i>
1391902 1394613 <i>and be a little more cynical<br />or jaundiced.</i>
1394696 1399327 <i>I had to be the one<br />that was most sincere.</i>
1399410 1402496 <i>It was tough.<br />I enjoy being a straight man.</i>
1402580 1406918 <i>And I always felt like, "Well, if I don't<br />set the robots up right, they're not"-</i>
1407001 1411297 <i>It's the old George Burns syndrome.<br />Gracie gets all the laughs.</i>
1411380 1413661 <i>But that didn't mean<br />that I didn't want some of the jokes.</i>
1418387 1421349 KURTZ:<br /><i>The script took many, many forms.</i>
1421432 1423476 <i>Originally we were looking for</i>
1423559 1427022 <i>a straightforward kind of<br />adventure scenario,</i>
1427105 1430025 <i>loosely based on some of<br />Kurosawa's approach,</i>
1430108 1432736 <i>like</i> The Hidden Fortress,<br /><i>which we actually tried to buy</i>
1432861 1434738 <i>the rights to at one time.</i>
1434821 1438992 <i>We also tried to buy the rights<br />to Flash Gordon as a comic strip.</i>
1439076 1442120 <i>And both of them were unavailable<br />either because of cost...</i>
1442371 1447793 <i>or because they just didn't want<br />anybody else to do a film on them.</i>
1449503 1454884 <i>But the script shifted up and back...</i>
1454968 1457679 <i>in terms of complications,<br />in terms of characters...</i>
1457762 1459889 <i>in terms of how<br />the basic story worked...</i>
1459973 1464394 <i>and whether or not it was a kind of</i><br />Hidden Fortress-<i>like adventure...</i>
1464477 1467397 <i>of taking the princess<br />across hostile territory,</i>
1467480 1469774 <i>which is what</i><br />Hidden Fortress <i>is all about...</i>
1469857 1472193 <i>or more complicated than that and one</i>
1472276 1475530 <i>that involved<br />several different kinds of worlds.</i>
1475613 1478950 <i>And, in the end,<br />it seemed to settle down...</i>
1479033 1483998 <i>to a very straightforward,<br />almost western-like adventure...</i>
1484581 1488419 <i>with a coming-of-age story<br />and very archetypal characters.</i>
1488502 1494633 <i>And it seemed to gestate into that<br />through all of the various drafts. And-</i>
1494717 1499763 <i>We also realized that<br />the original outline, as it developed,</i>
1499847 1503809 <i>was way too complicated-too long<br />a time span, too many characters.</i>
1503892 1506020 <i>It couldn't be made into one film.</i>
1506103 1509607 <i>So we picked a section<br />out of the middle...</i>
1509691 1512444 <i>that looked like<br />it could be made into a single film.</i>
1530962 1533048 WATTS:<br /><i>The very last day we were there-</i>
1533590 1536427 <i>the last shot we did<br />is the shot of Luke Skywalker...</i>
1536510 1538679 <i>looking up at the two suns setting.</i>
1538763 1542600 <i>There was one in there, and good old<br />ILM, they did the second one.</i>
1542683 1545102 <i>And we stood there,<br />and I watched the shot</i>
1545186 1547480 <i>as the sun went down, and we got it.</i>
1547563 1550149 <i>And the minute the sun dropped,<br />it started raining.</i>
1550232 1551650 <i>And I said, "Get off" -</i>
1551734 1553986 <i>We had to get off the salt flat<br />or we'd get stuck.</i>
1554070 1557156 <i>'Cause the crust breaks,<br />and it turns into grease.</i>
1557239 1560117 <i>We got everybody off,<br />but we left...</i>
1560201 1564206 <i>a Tunisian army six-wheel drive crane<br />that was totally ploughed in.</i>
1564498 1566875 <i>We couldn't get it out.<br />And another vehicle.</i>
1566958 1569586 <i>But we got everything<br />we needed for shooting out.</i>
1569669 1572172 <i>It was like that<br />all the way down the line.</i>
1579971 1583809 BURTT: <i>I had a space gun as a child,<br />and it made a little buzzing sound.</i>
1583892 1585769 <i>I loved it. And I always<br />associated that sound</i>
1585852 1588481 <i>with spacemen and science fiction.</i>
1588564 1589774 <i>And I recorded that sound</i>
1589857 1592026 <i>and used it for<br />the restraining bolt buzzer...</i>
1592110 1594612 <i>that Luke uses to locate 3PO.</i>
1608042 1611587 HAMILL: <i>Why I love 3PO so much<br />is he's like Luke's only friend.</i>
1611671 1613756 <i>If people read the novelization-</i>
1613840 1615968 <i>I don't know if the original screenplay<br />is available-</i>
1616051 1619638 <i>you see what I thought<br />was important to the character,</i>
1619721 1623517 <i>which has never been put back<br />in any of the restored versions.</i>
1623600 1627688 <i>You see Luke at his local hangout...</i>
1627771 1629731 <i>with people his own age...</i>
1629815 1632985 <i>to show where he stands,<br />you know, socially.</i>
1633068 1635654 <i>And he's not admired.</i>
1635737 1637217 <i>I guess they think he's a good pilot.</i>
1637281 1640117 <i>But it wasn't like<br />his character was popular,</i>
1640200 1643746 <i>or the in guy, or even had a girlfriend.</i>
1643830 1647834 <i>They all ridicule his aspirations...</i>
1647917 1650003 <i>and his starry-eyed attitude.</i>
1650086 1652922 <i>He's apolitical at that point.<br />He just wants to get out of the house.</i>
1653006 1654924 <i>Everybody can relate to that.</i>
1667854 1669480 PETER DIAMOND:<br /><i>We started rehearsals</i>
1669607 1671168 <i>about six weeks<br />before we started shooting.</i>
1671192 1674236 <i>I met Mark Hamill,<br />who came over to play Luke Skywalker.</i>
1674320 1677990 <i>Liked him. Got on immensely.<br />Keen looking and agile young man...</i>
1678073 1680075 <i>who wanted to do as<br />much as he could himself.</i>
1680159 1682745 <i>In fact, there were times<br />when I had to keep him back...</i>
1682828 1685206 <i>because he was<br />too enthusiastic actually.</i>
1686832 1691295 <i>I was the only stunt person<br />on the picture in Tunisia.</i>
1691378 1694048 <i>I got my break through George,</i>
1694131 1698220 <i>because one particular sequence,<br />Luke Skywalker had to be attacked...</i>
1698303 1701348 <i>by a Tusken Raider,<br />or a Sand Person, as it was.</i>
1701598 1704309 <i>So I took Luke up into the mountains...</i>
1704392 1706853 <i>to rehearse a sequence<br />where we were going to shoot it.</i>
1707687 1712025 <i>Now, George gave me carte blanche<br />to use any weapon I liked.</i>
1712108 1715654 <i>And I picked up what<br />I called a gaderffii stick,</i>
1715737 1717197 <i>which came from the prop shop.</i>
1717322 1719866 <i>And the reason I chose it-<br />I was in the British Army.</i>
1719950 1721826 <i>So I was used to rifle and bayonet.</i>
1721910 1724789 <i>I realized this weapon I could use<br />like a rifle and a bayonet.</i>
1724872 1727041 <i>So that's what I rehearsed the fight with.</i>
1727750 1730920 <i>Anyway, come the day of the shooting-<br />and I'd rehearsed Mark-</i>
1732713 1735132 <i>I said to George,<br />"George, who is the stunt person</i>
1735216 1736842 <i>who is going to do the fight?"</i>
1736926 1739679 <i>I said, "'Cause we don't have<br />any stunt people apart from me."</i>
1739762 1742723 <i>And he said, "Well, you better<br />play it then." Simple as that.</i>
1743766 1745142 <i>That is me.</i>
1745977 1748229 <i>And that is the Tusken Raider.</i>
1754069 1756154 EDLUND:<br /><i>I had a real good sense...</i>
1756238 1758782 <i>that this movie was gonna be a hit.</i>
1758907 1763704 <i>I mean,<br />but when George cast Alec Guinness,</i>
1763787 1767833 <i>I was totally convinced that this movie<br />was gonna be a blockbuster.</i>
1767916 1773213 <i>Because Alec Guinness could pull off<br />"Trust in the Force, Luke," you know.</i>
1773297 1778093 <i>Those lines under a lesser actor<br />would have fallen flat.</i>
1778176 1780364 BAKER: <i>I was very surprised<br />when Alec Guinness was in it.</i>
1780388 1782223 <i>You always think of Alec Guinness</i>
1782307 1785101 <i>as a Shakespearean<br />type of actor, don't you?</i>
1785184 1789939 <i>Sort of deep, hard, long speeches,<br />and goodness knows what else.</i>
1790023 1792483 <i>When he took this role,<br />I thought it must be a good movie,</i>
1792734 1794819 <i>'cause if he's in it,<br />he must know what he's doing.</i>
1797322 1799741 ALEC GUINNESS:<br /><i>I was in Hollywood...</i>
1799824 1802952 <i>making a movie called</i><br />Murder by Death...
1803036 1808208 <i>with David Niven and Peter Sellers<br />and various friends of mine.</i>
1808292 1813130 <i>And on my second from last day,<br />a script arrived on my dressing table.</i>
1814131 1817384 <i>I saw it was gonna be<br />directed by George Lucas.</i>
1817468 1820012 <i>George Lucas I knew about because</i>
1820095 1822931 of American Graffiti,<br /><i>which I admired very much.</i>
1823891 1825476 <i>And so I was immediately excited.</i>
1825726 1827406 <i>When I opened it<br />and I saw science fiction,</i>
1827478 1830522 <i>I thought, "Oh, Lord.<br />I've never done a science fiction."</i>
1830773 1833443 <i>I've seen one or two<br />and quite enjoyed them...</i>
1833526 1835737 <i>but always thought<br />they were a bit cardboard</i>
1835820 1838198 <i>from an actor's point of view.</i>
1839032 1841701 <i>But because of Lucas<br />I started reading it,</i>
1841826 1844162 <i>and then I found myself involved.</i>
1844245 1849292 <i>There was an excitement in the script.<br />I wanted to turn each page...</i>
1849376 1851836 <i>to know what happened next.</i>
1851920 1854130 <i>Very much so<br />I wanted to know the story line.</i>
1854214 1857842 <i>But I also wanted to know<br />each little incident,</i>
1857926 1860012 <i>how it was concluded.</i>
1860096 1863265 <i>I found a carrying forward.</i>
1863349 1866477 <i>I mean, like reading a novel<br />which you don't want to put down.</i>
1902514 1907310 HAMILL: <i>He loved the idea of playing<br />a mentor or wizard in a morality play...</i>
1908562 1910605 <i>where good and evil<br />are so clearly defined,</i>
1910856 1913275 <i>and that's what appealed to him.</i>
1913943 1918865 GUINNESS:<br /><i>It's a sort of a cross-a sort of wise man,</i>
1918948 1920616 <i>some warrior in outer space</i>
1920700 1923035 <i>at some time or other<br />who's been on the run...</i>
1923119 1927957 <i>and then hiding in the desert<br />from his enemies,</i>
1928040 1934630 <i>but has a lot of knowledge about life<br />and about space presumably.</i>
1934922 1938509 <i>A sort of mystical character in a way...</i>
1938593 1944349 <i>who's raked into the story<br />to assist the young people.</i>
1945100 1949897 <i>I think he's meant to suggest<br />a kind of jump ahead in his imagination,</i>
1949980 1953025 <i>or in his awareness<br />of what's going to happen.</i>
1955068 1956862 HAMILL:<br /><i>But he had a great sense of humor.</i>
1956945 1962159 <i>And I've told this story,<br />but I kept referring to him as Sir Alec.</i>
1962242 1966371 <i>And he tapped me twice and then gave<br />me a pretty good</i>- [THUMPS]
1966455 1967623 <i>I said, "Wh-Wh-What?"</i>
1967873 1969459 <i>He said, "I want to be<br />known by my name,</i>
1969542 1971461 <i>not my accolade."</i>
1972670 1975548 <i>To which I replied, "What<br />do you want me to call you-Big Al?"</i>
1975632 1980053 <i>He loved that sort of stuff.<br />He loves American irreverence.</i>
1984682 1989938 <i>He'd come to our defense in terms<br />of defending the sort of American way...</i>
1990021 1994234 <i>because we stereotypically<br />have poor grammar.</i>
1995235 1998155 <i>We were watching that documentary<br />about Monty Python,</i>
1998239 2000658 <i>and Graham Chapman<br />was talking about Terry Gilliam.</i>
2000908 2002511 <i>"He said," We were flying over<br />the Great Lakes,</i>
2002535 2004453 <i>and Terry being an American"-</i>
2004537 2008040 <i>he says parenthetically-<br />"his comment was,</i>
2008123 2011210 <i>'Hey, you guys,<br />a whole bunch of water."</i>
2011293 2015548 <i>And Graham's comment was,<br />"He tends to say 'bunch' a lot...</i>
2015631 2018259 <i>when in fact he means 'a lot' a lot,"</i>
2018342 2023306 <i>in that kind of snotty way where<br />you want to smack him.</i> [CHUCKLES]
2023390 2028144 <i>And yet Alec would point out how that<br />was perfectly acceptable to use,</i>
2028228 2030689 <i>even though he wasn't<br />referring to bananas.</i>
2045620 2047497 <i>George himself called it<br />the most expensive</i>
2047581 2049332 <i>low-budget movie ever made,</i>
2049416 2053504 <i>and it seemed facetious at the time,<br />but you could see that he meant it in-</i>
2053588 2057216 <i>or at least I took in the sense<br />that every dollar</i>
2057300 2060052 <i>is going to wind up on the screen.</i>
2060469 2062629 <i>But I probably suffered<br />from what George suffered from.</i>
2062680 2065349 <i>Because when you read it-</i>
2065433 2071147 <i>There's no budgetary limitations<br />on your imagination,</i>
2071230 2073608 <i>so you imagine it, you know,</i>
2074609 2080324 <i>far more opulent and grandiose<br />than what you're able to achieve.</i>
2081033 2085329 <i>And there were times where I thought,<br />"Oh, that's kind of disappointing."</i>
2085787 2088248 <i>But you have to keep the faith.</i>
2088332 2090375 <i>Because even though<br />the lightsabers looked</i>
2090459 2092586 <i>kind of chintzy<br />when we were shooting them,</i>
2093920 2095547 <i>in post-production, they were able to</i>
2095631 2097424 <i>give them the look<br />that they needed to have.</i>
2097549 2103138 <i>And, of course, the great Ben Burtt's<br />sound effects sell it really well.</i>
2106267 2110730 <i>The handle was from an antique<br />camera that would do the flash powder,</i>
2110813 2116569 <i>but the effect of the lightsaber<br />was basically a rotating pole...</i>
2116653 2121449 <i>that had movie screen material<br />applied to it...</i>
2121532 2125620 <i>so that it would reflect its light source<br />back at many times the intensity.</i>
2127163 2129499 <i>So there were baby pin spots<br />directed at it,</i>
2129582 2131752 <i>and they shot it<br />through angled green glass.</i>
2131835 2133545 <i>I mean, this is to my memory.</i>
2133629 2135464 <i>I didn't think it looked all that hot,</i>
2135547 2137567 <i>but then they said, "Come around<br />and look through the lens."</i>
2137591 2140678 <i>And it did look great.<br />It was movie screen material.</i>
2140761 2147393 <i>It had, you know, all that reflective<br />sandpaper-looking surface to it.</i>
2147476 2151313 <i>And the problem was that when you<br />moved it out of a certain area,</i>
2151397 2154608 <i>it went from glowing and looking<br />great through the angled green glass</i>
2154692 2156568 <i>to just a rotating pole.</i>
2156652 2158530 <i>Because I'd hold my hand still.</i>
2158613 2161491 <i>I had the battery pack with the wires<br />running down my arm.</i>
2161574 2163868 <i>Everybody would stop,<br />and they'd run in</i>
2163952 2167455 <i>and they'd put the pole<br />onto the handle,</i>
2167539 2170625 <i>and I'd click it on, and it would rotate.</i>
2170709 2174337 <i>I thought it would be the handles<br />and they'd put in cartoon blades later.</i>
2174421 2177799 <i>But if you were sword-fighting, you<br />wouldn't know when to stop your hand.</i>
2177882 2180427 <i>You needed something to strike.</i>
2181720 2186267 KURTZ: <i>The concept of the Force<br />was an important one in the story,</i>
2186350 2192231 <i>and the difficulty is trying to create<br />a religious-spiritual concept...</i>
2192314 2196444 <i>that works in a very simple way<br />without heavy exposition...</i>
2196527 2199739 <i>or without it seeming<br />to pull down the story.</i>
2204660 2206454 <i>In the end-</i>
2206537 2210499 <i>I had studied Hinduism, Buddhism<br />and many of the Eastern religions,</i>
2210583 2214671 <i>and so I felt that that was the way<br />to go with the Force.</i>
2215213 2219176 <i>It's a very simple approach<br />and still very powerful.</i>
2219259 2221595 <i>The connection with the universe<br />was kind of...</i>
2221678 2225348 <i>blending that with<br />Native American spiritual teachings...</i>
2225432 2228769 <i>which believe that everything<br />is tied to a kind of universal energy...</i>
2228852 2230562 <i>that they call the Great Mystery.</i>
2231480 2234191 <i>And it just seemed to fit<br />because of the way</i>
2234274 2236485 <i>the character needed to talk about it...</i>
2236568 2239529 <i>and the way, in Luke's case,<br />tap into it at the end,</i>
2239613 2243910 <i>and yet not be so complicated that<br />the audience would turn off about it.</i>
2244160 2246037 <i>Even if they didn't get it,<br />it wouldn't matter</i>
2246120 2248790 <i>because it all worked<br />anyway on the surface.</i>
2249791 2252543 LUCAS: <i>Vader would have become<br />infinitely more powerful...</i>
2252627 2255880 <i>if he hadn't ended up in his suit<br />and being half man and half machine,</i>
2255963 2258007 <i>which diminishes his powers<br />considerably</i>
2258090 2260218 <i>over the powers the Emperor has.</i>
2260301 2265723 <i>And I wanted that relationship of Vader<br />kind of being reduced to-</i>
2265807 2269603 <i>I mean, "assistant" is too low a word,<br />but he's a henchman,</i>
2269686 2272815 <i>which is the impression you have<br />when you saw the first movie by itself.</i>
2272898 2274375 <i>But if you reflect on it a little bit,</i>
2274399 2276485 <i>you realize that<br />that's actually not the way it is.</i>
2276568 2278987 <i>The fact that he basically<br />takes orders from Tarkin,</i>
2279071 2282199 <i>who isn't an equal to him at all.</i>
2282282 2285786 <i>He's way below him really,<br />but he doesn't have much choice...</i>
2285869 2289540 <i>because he's hobbled<br />by his infirmities...</i>
2289623 2293544 <i>and the new order<br />which he has become a part of.</i>
2308810 2311831 BURTT: <i>There's a few different effects<br />associated with Vader using the Force.</i>
2311855 2315859 <i>We always put in a deep low-frequency<br />kind of earthquake rumble...</i>
2315942 2320446 <i>which could be amped up as Vader<br />tightened the Force on someone.</i>
2331667 2333895 <i>The deep rumbles came from<br />a number of different sources.</i>
2333919 2337464 <i>Some of it was just some thunder<br />that was slowed way down...</i>
2337548 2339466 <i>and the high frequencies rolled off.</i>
2339550 2343846 <i>Some of it was the slowed-down<br />sound of a missile launch,</i>
2344722 2346098 <i>and some of it was...</i>
2346640 2347975 <i>from the Fox library actually.</i>
2348058 2352355 <i>It was some earthquake material made<br />for</i> Journey to the Center of the Earth.
2352439 2357527 Star Wars <i>being a Fox film<br />allowed us to, if we wanted to,</i>
2357611 2361281 <i>to use some sound effects<br />from their old classic library.</i>
2361364 2363575 <i>And being a real fan<br />of the old sound effects,</i>
2363658 2366828 <i>I did pull a few things<br />and use them here and there.</i>
2366912 2369039 <i>But most of the effort was put into</i>
2369122 2371750 <i>customizing original sounds<br />for the movie.</i>
2379634 2382637 <i>One day-maybe I was bored-<br />I took my microphone,</i>
2382720 2385765 <i>and I put it inside the pipe that's part</i>
2385848 2389352 <i>of the suction device<br />on a vacuum cleaner.</i>
2389435 2391187 <i>And I held it out the window</i>
2391270 2393856 <i>and I just pointed it at<br />the Los Angeles freeway.</i>
2393940 2396400 <i>The roar of the freeway<br />as it went through</i>
2396484 2399362 <i>this metal pipe<br />and into the microphone...</i>
2399445 2404368 <i>had a funny kind of phasing<br />or slight echoing to it,</i>
2404451 2406745 <i>and that became the sound<br />of the force field</i>
2406828 2409581 <i>of the landspeeder<br />as it hovers in space.</i>
2409665 2413752 <i>It became the basis actually for all<br />the kind of levitation force fields...</i>
2413835 2418548 <i>which are used in many</i> Star Wars<br /><i>speeders and other vehicles.</i>
2426056 2431020 <i>There's a line in the film that Luke uses.<br />He says, "Sand People. Or worse."</i>
2431104 2434399 <i>And for some reason somewhere<br />along the way in post-production,</i>
2434482 2439070 <i>the picture editing department began to<br />say to any sound editor that showed up,</i>
2439153 2441990 <i>"Oh, sound people. Or worse."</i>
2442073 2444784 <i>At first, it was a little bit of a mockery,</i>
2444867 2448663 <i>but we began to take<br />that mockery serious,</i>
2448746 2452458 <i>and we had a T-shirt made up that said<br />"Sound people... or worse,"</i>
2452542 2454794 <i>which had a picture<br />of a Tusken Raider on it.</i>
2454877 2457297 <i>And instead of holding his gaffi stick,<br />he had</i>
2457381 2459925 <i>a fish pole with<br />a microphone on the end of it.</i>
2460009 2463095 <i>And so it became a badge of honor<br />to be a sound person.</i>
2476025 2480904 FISHER:<br /><i>Ah. My little cell away from home.</i>
2480988 2485577 <i>I look a little frightened, with my feet<br />that don't touch the floor.</i>
2486703 2491416 <i>The dental thing was ominous, though,<br />the little dental robot.</i>
2491499 2493084 <i>Yeah. I knew right then.</i>
2493168 2495920 <i>"Is it safe?"</i><br />[CHUCKLES]
2497589 2502761 <i>In the original script,<br />I was tortured by Darth Vader,</i>
2503261 2505096 <i>who, naturally,<br />turns out to be my father,</i>
2505180 2508016 <i>by being hung upside down<br />under the Death Star somewhere</i>
2508099 2510060 <i>with yellow eyes.</i>
2510185 2513647 <i>And then the Wookiee carries me<br />through subterranean vats</i>
2513731 2515649 <i>of water or something.</i>
2515733 2519028 <i>And I thought,<br />"Well, who doesn't want to do that?"</i>
2524533 2529205 GUINNESS: <i>We did location work<br />in Tunisia on the edge of the Sahara...</i>
2529497 2534543 <i>on some of these extraordinary salt<br />flats, which stretch for a hundred miles.</i>
2534627 2536128 <i>Well, they virtually-</i>
2536212 2539174 <i>I mean, have you ever gone to the<br />Sahara? It stretches for 3, 000 miles.</i>
2540467 2547057 <i>And there's a great feeling<br />of strange, flat space.</i>
2547140 2550060 <i>But it's genuine space.<br />It's real and gritty.</i>
2550143 2551978 <i>And also shots...</i>
2552604 2555023 <i>in canyons in the sandstone hills,</i>
2555107 2557901 <i>which are very dramatic to look at.</i>
2557984 2564241 <i>But you feel it's real. It's not, um-<br />It's not some made-up world.</i>
2587640 2589767 BURTT: <i>Probably the focal point<br />for alien voices</i>
2589851 2592186 <i>in the film is in<br />the Mos Eisley cantina,</i>
2592270 2596024 <i>which was a real exciting sequence<br />for sound because-</i>
2597025 2599653 <i>I had very primitive equipment<br />back then</i>
2599736 2601738 <i>that I could use to change<br />the pitch of a voice-</i>
2601822 2604074 <i>make it very low or make it very high.</i>
2604158 2606410 <i>Of course, everything was mechanical<br />in those days</i>
2606493 2608829 <i>in terms of how we dealt with sound.</i>
2608912 2611039 <i>If I wanted a voice to change,<br />I could speed</i>
2611123 2614042 <i>the motors up which<br />ran the tape recorder...</i>
2614126 2617171 <i>and the voice would run faster<br />and be higher pitched.</i>
2617921 2620633 KURTZ: <i>One of the hardest shots<br />we had was the landspeeder...</i>
2620717 2624012 <i>where it drives up<br />to the front of the cantina.</i>
2624846 2627724 <i>We shot that shot<br />using the VistaVision camera...</i>
2627807 2631811 <i>with the actors on board<br />the landspeeder.</i>
2631895 2635940 <i>And the wheels on the landspeeder,<br />it just sort of drove over there.</i>
2636024 2639694 <i>And what we wanted was it to hover<br />and sort of float over there.</i>
2640195 2642989 <i>So we shot the shot again<br />with a motion control camera...</i>
2643072 2647077 <i>without anything in it except the extras-<br />no vehicle whatsoever.</i>
2647161 2650372 <i>And the idea was to put<br />the vehicle in later.</i>
2651123 2654710 <i>And we never did get<br />that shot exactly right.</i>
2654793 2658881 <i>We tried it at ILM<br />at least five different times.</i>
2658964 2661675 <i>And then I sent it out to Disney to try...</i>
2661759 2665095 <i>and two other visual effects houses<br />outside</i>
2665179 2668724 <i>to try to get the matching of the shot.</i>
2668807 2672895 <i>And in the original release of</i> Star Wars,<br /><i>that shot doesn't look very good.</i>
2672978 2675023 <i>It's one of the worst shots<br />in the whole film.</i>
2675106 2678109 <i>It's dirty, and it's full of specks<br />and all kinds of things.</i>
2678860 2681404 <i>It was cleaned up<br />in the Special Edition a bit,</i>
2681655 2684866 <i>but it should have been<br />a really easy shot to do.</i>
2684950 2686534 <i>We had a lot of other much more</i>
2686618 2688870 <i>complicated shots<br />that seemed to work fine.</i>
2688954 2692207 <i>I suppose the big difference between<br />that work in the optical medium then...</i>
2692749 2697254 <i>and digital work now<br />is one of what you can see.</i>
2697337 2700674 <i>We had to wait a long time<br />to see anything.</i>
2702927 2704637 STUART FREEBORN:<br /><i>I was in my workshop,</i>
2704720 2706264 <i>and this young boy came in.</i>
2706347 2709016 <i>He looked about 23 years old.<br />That's all.</i>
2709100 2711310 <i>And he said,<br />"My name is George Lucas."</i>
2711394 2713437 <i>I'd never heard of George Lucas<br />at that point.</i>
2713688 2717233 <i>And he said,<br />"I've seen what you did on</i> 2001,"
2717316 2721362 <i>and I would like you therefore<br />to do the work on this film...</i>
2721445 2723364 <i>"and make the creatures for me."</i>
2723447 2727076 <i>I said, "Oh, that's interesting."<br />He said, "Would you want to do it?"</i>
2727159 2731081 <i>I said, "Well, look, I never do a film<br />unless I've read the script first."</i>
2731164 2733375 <i>And he said, "Right."<br />And he got his little case.</i>
2733458 2736420 <i>He produced the script straightaway.<br />I said, "Right."</i>
2736712 2740674 <i>He said, "Well, take it home, read it.<br />That's my number. Let me know."</i>
2740757 2746179 <i>I read it, and I phoned him and I said,<br />"I'd love to do it." And that was it.</i>
2758276 2761863 LUCAS:<br /><i>It's about the prejudice against droids,</i>
2761946 2765241 <i>which is again symbolic<br />of people intolerant</i>
2765325 2769078 <i>of things that aren't similar<br />to themselves.</i>
2770038 2772040 <i>In this case, life-forms.</i>
2772123 2775168 <i>Obviously there was a wide variety<br />of life-forms in this movie-</i>
2775251 2777170 <i>and this scene in particular-</i>
2777253 2780089 <i>who are very, very different<br />and very odd.</i>
2785387 2788474 <i>But they're prejudiced basically<br />against non-life-forms.</i>
2788724 2791226 <i>So at least one of the ideas here is</i>
2791310 2793979 <i>we've gotten to the point<br />of accepting life-forms,</i>
2794063 2795856 <i>no matter how different they look.</i>
2795939 2798359 <i>They're all part of the same life process.</i>
2803530 2805467 DIAMOND: <i>In Tunisia,<br />while we were shooting there,</i>
2805491 2807117 <i>I obviously spent time with George</i>
2807201 2808994 <i>and had dinner with him<br />a couple of times.</i>
2809913 2813083 <i>I'm always interested in how producers<br />get the finance to do pictures.</i>
2813166 2815377 <i>Whether this is a true story or not,<br />I don't know.</i>
2815460 2817379 <i>All I can tell you is what he told me.</i>
2817462 2821216 <i>I said, "How did you get the finance<br />to make</i> Star Wars?"
2821299 2823718 <i>He said, "Well, I obviously tried<br />a lot of the majors,</i>
2823802 2825345 <i>and they weren't interested."</i>
2825970 2828348 <i>But he said, "I took it to a major,</i>
2828431 2830016 <i>and they'd had a reasonable success</i>
2830100 2832477 <i>with a picture called<br />the</i> Planet of the Apes."
2832560 2835313 <i>So, he said, "I can only assume<br />they saw the big monkey...</i>
2835397 2837983 <i>and thought they'd had one monkey<br />make some money for them,</i>
2838067 2839878 <i>"they might make some money<br />with this other monkey."</i>
2839902 2843114 <i>So that's how he got the money-<br />if that's right-to make the picture.</i>
2845991 2847618 PETER MAYHEW: <i>My name had</i>
2847701 2849578 <i>been put forward through<br />the art department,</i>
2849870 2852289 <i>because they were looking for<br />a big person</i>
2852373 2855126 <i>to do this particular character.</i>
2855209 2858212 <i>She said,<br />"Well, it's what we call a Wookiee.</i>
2858295 2861924 <i>It's a great big, hairy creature."</i>
2862007 2867472 <i>When you look at the costume, it has<br />a bear's body and a dog's head on it.</i>
2867556 2871435 <i>If a bear's not on four legs,<br />it walks around on two legs.</i>
2871518 2873103 <i>Therefore, because it's got a big body,</i>
2873562 2877190 <i>the knees bend slightly.</i>
2877274 2880444 <i>Therefore, that is the way<br />the Wookiee walks.</i>
2888535 2890537 HARRISON FORD:<br /><i>I always thought,</i>
2890620 2892999 <i>when we were making it,<br />that it had two strengths.</i>
2893082 2897336 <i>One was the strength<br />of its unoriginal elements,</i>
2897420 2901466 <i>that is to say,<br />the story of the three characters-</i>
2901549 2908431 <i>the story of a boy's gaining manhood<br />and his relationship with his father.</i>
2909182 2911642 <i>That story seemed quite simple<br />and straightforward...</i>
2911893 2915897 <i>and a story that I'd heard before<br />and that I knew was an effective story.</i>
2917064 2919067 <i>Then there was the other element,</i>
2919151 2922029 <i>which was that we were doing<br />a kind of comedy</i>
2922112 2925449 <i>with a kind of bizarre reality to it.</i>
2930662 2936043 <i>There's a visual uniqueness<br />that's part of the fabric of</i> Star Wars.
2936126 2938670 <i>We're seeing things<br />we've never seen before...</i>
2938962 2942216 <i>that might not be accepted,<br />but I thought would be...</i>
2942299 2944259 <i>on the strength of the power</i>
2944343 2946971 <i>of that human story<br />that underlied everything.</i>
2960652 2962445 LUCAS: <i>I think ultimately<br />I'm more interested</i>
2962529 2964280 <i>in getting good actors in my movie.</i>
2964364 2966157 <i>I'm really interested in the acting.</i>
2966241 2968159 <i>A movie star is basically a trademark.</i>
2968243 2970203 <i>It's somebody that you put in the movie</i>
2970286 2972455 <i>because, when you sell it<br />to the theaters...</i>
2972539 2975143 <i>or you sell it to the audience,<br />you say, "That's a Tom Cruise movie."</i>
2975167 2977044 <i>I understand. I know Tom Cruise.</i>
2977127 2980464 <i>It's like Coca-Cola, you know.<br />Oh, yeah. Okay, I'll buy that product.</i>
2980548 2982925 <i>That's what it really<br />comes down to in the end.</i>
2983008 2987054 <i>I don't particularly subscribe<br />to that marketing theory.</i>
2987137 2992351 <i>I basically think if the material is good<br />and it's a very good story,</i>
2992434 2994687 <i>then the audience will find it.</i>
2994937 2996855 <i>And still, I would say,<br />most people in Hollywood</i>
2996939 2998482 <i>would think I'm extremely naive.</i>
2999943 3003071 <i>I've made movies without movie stars,<br />and they've been dismal failures.</i>
3003154 3006741 <i>But, you know, it's more I think<br />the fact that it was not a movie</i>
3006825 3009035 <i>that anybody wanted to see.</i>
3009119 3011389 <i>It wasn't something<br />that sort of sparked their imagination,</i>
3011413 3014332 <i>or it wasn't the kind of thing<br />that was appropriate</i>
3014416 3016209 <i>at that particular time in the culture.</i>
3020130 3023383 KURTZ: <i>The choice of cast<br />was very much a combination...</i>
3023466 3030182 <i>of what the script really called for<br />and the economics of the film.</i>
3031267 3033603 <i>I've never been a big believer in putting</i>
3033686 3036105 <i>established stars<br />in a kind of fantasy situation...</i>
3036188 3038691 <i>where you have to believe<br />their character</i>
3038774 3041235 <i>is totally different from who they are.</i>
3041319 3045156 <i>So we were in total agreement<br />about the fact of using unknowns</i>
3045239 3047658 <i>for the young people, definitely.</i>
3047742 3050995 FISHER:<br /><i>The last line of the script was...</i>
3051078 3055417 <i>"The princess walks up<br />to the end of a huge hallway..."</i>
3055500 3056793 <i>And all the troops are lined up.</i>
3057544 3060088 <i>"She is staggeringly beautiful."</i>
3060172 3066011 <i>And I crossed out the "L-Y" and the<br />"beautiful" and felt more comfortable.</i>
3066094 3071558 <i>But honestly, she was a "chip on<br />both shoulders" kind of a princess.</i>
3071642 3074394 <i>And George cast people-</i>
3074853 3077731 <i>I think he said this at the time-<br />one of his few talking jags</i>
3077814 3079691 <i>that lasted 30 seconds-</i>
3079775 3082445 <i>that he cast people with<br />big personalities.</i>
3082528 3085281 <i>So that was the three of us.</i>
3093706 3096292 LUCAS: <i>A very important aspect<br />of making a movie...</i>
3096376 3099045 <i>is you gotta make people believe in</i>
3099128 3101714 <i>the characters and the story<br />and the situation,</i>
3101798 3105218 <i>which in a movie like this<br />is next to impossible.</i>
3105301 3107595 <i>'Cause obviously everything<br />here is fake.</i>
3107679 3109640 <i>Everything is fake, you know-</i>
3109723 3112184 <i>all the sets and the characters<br />and the worlds.</i>
3112267 3114269 <i>I wanted to make it<br />as realistic as possible...</i>
3114353 3117106 <i>so you believe this could actually<br />have existed someplace-</i>
3117189 3119733 <i>a big challenge, especially<br />since it's got a light tone to it.</i>
3119817 3123070 <i>This is not a serious movie.<br />It's a kind of light-hearted movie.</i>
3123153 3125322 <i>And to give it some kind<br />of a grounding...</i>
3125406 3129076 <i>so you can believe in the story<br />and believe in the characters...</i>
3129159 3131704 <i>and get wrapped up<br />in the drama of it all.</i>
3133288 3135124 BURTT: <i>There was never an attempt</i>
3135207 3137502 <i>to create a definitive,<br />complete language...</i>
3137585 3142424 <i>with all of the verb conjugations<br />or the things that you'd really imagine.</i>
3142507 3145677 <i>The goal in all<br />of these developments of sound...</i>
3145760 3149764 <i>is always to create the impression<br />that there's a real language.</i>
3149848 3152100 <i>We don't understand it,<br />but it sounds intelligent,</i>
3153727 3156163 <i>and it sounds like it has enough culture<br />and background to it to be plausible.</i>
3156187 3161526 <i>I never rigorously insisted on one word<br />having a particular meaning.</i>
3162652 3166824 <i>Jabba the Hutt or other speakers<br />might use the word</i> "boska"
3166907 3170202 <i>in several different contexts.</i>
3170286 3173289 <i>So there was never an attempt<br />to be too rigid about it.</i>
3173372 3175666 <i>It was always an attempt<br />to come up with</i>
3175750 3177710 <i>the right impression at the right time...</i>
3177793 3184550 <i>and to keep it consistent in the kind of<br />vowels and the rhythm of the speech...</i>
3184633 3187928 <i>so that it sounded<br />like it was a real language.</i>
3197355 3200400 MUREN: <i>The animation for this<br />sequence and the Jabba creature...</i>
3200484 3204154 <i>was based on Phil Tippett's<br />designs on</i> Jedi.
3204237 3208533 <i>And they were done during<br />the newer version of the show...</i>
3208617 3210702 <i>that was done just a few years ago.</i>
3210786 3214331 <i>George found the plates that he'd shot,<br />and it was quite a bit of work</i>
3214414 3216416 <i>putting Jabba into this.</i>
3216500 3218341 <i>There was a lot of<br />reconstruction of the plates</i>
3218419 3220880 <i>to move him over, move Han over,</i>
3220963 3222882 <i>get him in the right place,</i>
3222965 3224842 <i>get the backgrounds to work<br />and everything,</i>
3224926 3227929 <i>and to have this big character in there<br />that was a lot bigger I believe...</i>
3228221 3230473 <i>than George's original idea for it.</i>
3230556 3233643 <i>We had to redo the plates<br />to accommodate</i>
3233726 3236395 <i>the space of the new big, slobby Jabba.</i>
3238564 3241901 <i>And it was pretty cute, you know.<br />A lot of real interesting ideas here.</i>
3241984 3245364 <i>Close contact with Jabba-<br />sort of walk around and look at him.</i>
3245447 3247767 <i>It was pretty bold stuff,<br />but I think it's foreshadowing...</i>
3247825 3251620 <i>what George was ready to do<br />on the first three</i> Star Wars <i>movies.</i>
3251703 3252996 <i>He was just testing ILM out...</i>
3253539 3254748 <i>to see if we could do it.</i>
3257960 3260379 PAUL HIRSCH:<br /><i>I remember when Luke sees...</i>
3260462 3262381 <i>the</i> Millennium Falcon <i>for the first time.</i>
3262464 3265509 <i>He goes with Han Solo to the hangar<br />where it is in Mos Eisley,</i>
3265592 3267970 <i>and the camera pans over,<br />and then we cut.</i>
3268262 3271222 <i>And I said to George, "I think we ought<br />to hold that shot a little longer."</i>
3271516 3273935 <i>He said, "You can't."<br />I said, "What do you mean you can't?"</i>
3274018 3277522 <i>He said, "Well, that's the last frame."<br />I said, "Well, you hardly get to see it."</i>
3277605 3280984 <i>He said, "Well, that's it.<br />That's all we have."</i>
3286573 3288950 <i>I've often thought movies are somehow</i>
3289033 3292954 <i>very similar<br />to the set of a street in a western,</i>
3293037 3294789 <i>where you see the facade<br />and the window</i>
3294873 3296666 <i>of the saloon and the swinging doors.</i>
3296749 3299295 <i>And if you go behind,<br />it's just a flat piece of wood</i>
3299378 3301380 <i>held up by a few two-by-fours.</i>
3301463 3303924 <i>And if you looked at the extension<br />of every shot in</i> Star Wars,
3304008 3306051 <i>you'd see everything<br />would come apart.</i>
3306343 3309471 <i>The only things that are there<br />is what's presentable.</i>
3309555 3312516 <i>Everything behind the scenes<br />is a mess.</i>
3316020 3319565 WATTS: <i>George had us look<br />at a series of films when we started,</i>
3319648 3323819 <i>and those films were</i> 2001,<br /><i>naturally enough,</i>
3323903 3326740 Silent Running,<br /><i>another outer space movie.</i>
3326823 3329993 <i>The two other films<br />were Fellini's</i> Satyricon...
3330076 3333496 <i>and Sergio Leone's</i><br />Once Upon a Time in the West,
3333580 3336833 <i>which sound like odd movies<br />to put into this thing.</i>
3336917 3339669 <i>But they were to do with the look<br />he wanted, the style of things.</i>
3339753 3344466 <i>So in</i> Star Wars, <i>you know,<br />the spaceships were a bit rough.</i>
3344549 3346760 <i>The</i> Millennium Falcon<br /><i>is like a second-hand car.</i>
3346843 3348970 <i>You're never sure<br />if it's going to start or not.</i>
3349054 3351431 <i>That was great,<br />because we're not used to that.</i>
3355811 3360358 BURTT: <i>The jump to hyperspace<br />was an explosive sound.</i>
3360441 3361984 <i>There really were two sounds.</i>
3362068 3365279 <i>The first thing was a generator start,<br />which is kind of a quick-changing pitch</i>
3365363 3366822 <i>of an engine.</i>
3366906 3370493 <i>It was actually an electronic motor<br />I recorded in an elevator shaft.</i>
3370576 3372745 <i>It was the motor<br />which starts an elevator up and down.</i>
3372828 3376082 <i>And that was combined<br />with an explosion</i>
3376165 3379835 <i>which was really just<br />a piece of a thunderclap.</i>
3379919 3383382 <i>The actual sharp beginning<br />of the thunderclap was cut off,</i>
3383465 3390138 <i>and then the more mid-range<br />explosive part of the clap...</i>
3390430 3393850 <i>was used for that moment that<br />they actually break out into hyperspace.</i>
3394685 3397104 MUREN: <i>So now we're about to<br />introduce the hyperspace idea.</i>
3397396 3399523 <i>This is something that<br />Richard pioneered</i>
3399606 3401650 <i>with his experience at Bob Abel-</i>
3401733 3404653 <i>that he had been working at before,<br />doing television commercials</i>
3404736 3406363 <i>with streak photography-</i>
3406446 3409575 <i>to give it a sense of<br />sort of a rubber band effect to things,</i>
3409659 3411077 <i>and this came out really well.</i>
3411160 3413705 <i>You're going so fast<br />that everything just sort of stretches,</i>
3413788 3417625 <i>and you're catapulted out<br />into another place in the universe.</i>
3434476 3437479 FISHER:<br /><i>Oh, this is the first scene I ever shot.</i>
3450200 3453287 <i>Peter Cushing-<br />he smelled like lavender,</i>
3453370 3458042 <i>but he has an extraordinary face.</i>
3459043 3462589 <i>I basically just started talking like him,</i>
3462672 3465884 <i>so I may have patterned<br />my performance after his.</i>
3474559 3476936 <i>He wore these little gloves.</i>
3477020 3480774 <i>I think he wore the little gloves<br />'cause he smoked cigarettes.</i>
3480857 3485570 <i>Then this is the scene<br />where they blow up my planet,</i>
3485653 3490534 <i>and what I looked at<br />was a board with a circle on it...</i>
3490618 3494246 <i>with a guy drinking tea<br />looking like he couldn't wait for lunch.</i>
3499460 3502755 <i>So when I looked terrified at this thing<br />that's going to blow up,</i>
3502838 3507343 <i>it's one of those things-<br />a flag that, you know,</i>
3507426 3510137 <i>they put in front of a light with a circle.</i>
3510221 3514809 <i>Now that was where<br />the little man was drinking tea.</i>
3521566 3525112 FORD:<br /><i>Her personality was very useful</i>
3525195 3527864 <i>in describing the character she plays.</i>
3528532 3533078 <i>Princess Leia<br />was not a huge stretch for Carrie,</i>
3533161 3538166 <i>who was a kind of Hollywood princess<br />growing up with her mom and dad.</i>
3538250 3543631 <i>But her wit is really<br />a display of her intelligence.</i>
3543714 3546509 <i>She really understands<br />what it was that we were doing,</i>
3546592 3548719 <i>and I thought she was very effective.</i>
3563151 3565444 PHIL TIPPETT:<br /><i>George was putting together</i>
3565528 3567280 <i>some insert material that he needed.</i>
3567572 3570284 <i>And through Rick Baker,<br />Jon Berg and myself-</i>
3570576 3573620 <i>and Laine Liska and Doug Beswick<br />and a couple of other guys, Rob Bottin-</i>
3573704 3579293 <i>set up this rubber shop mostly over<br />a bunch of masks that Rick had.</i>
3579543 3581879 <i>And Jon Berg and I-<br />Actually, all the people on the crew</i>
3581962 3583672 <i>were stop-motion animators.</i>
3583755 3587551 <i>And I had some stuff<br />that somehow George had seen,</i>
3587634 3591180 <i>and he was also interested in us doing<br />this little chess sequence as well.</i>
3592014 3595809 <i>He was initially thinking about doing it<br />with live actors and masks,</i>
3595934 3597788 <i>but I think it was because</i><br />Westworld <i>had come out.</i>
3597812 3599412 <i>There was something<br />very similar to that,</i>
3599647 3601900 <i>so he thought the stop-motion<br />animation</i>
3601983 3604235 <i>would be a fun way<br />of making it different.</i>
3607655 3610074 <i>These little characters were articulated.</i>
3610158 3611993 <i>All the joints were articulated<br />so they could</i>
3612076 3613953 <i>be moved one single frame at a time.</i>
3614037 3617999 <i>And then one frame of 35-millimeter<br />motion picture film was exposed.</i>
3618082 3620335 <i>And it was all set up by Dennis Muren</i>
3620418 3623004 <i>on a completely black set<br />to a lineup clip.</i>
3623087 3626717 <i>He would put a little lineup clip<br />in the camera of the background...</i>
3626800 3629303 <i>that George shot on location of C-3PO</i>
3629386 3631972 <i>and the Wookiee<br />looking at this chessboard.</i>
3632056 3635035 <i>The camera was at the right height<br />and the right angle with the right lens...</i>
3635059 3637728 <i>looking at this thing,<br />and it was just all against black.</i>
3637853 3641023 <i>And we plotted<br />where the little creatures would go...</i>
3641106 3644693 <i>and animated the scenes for the frame<br />lengths that were necessary.</i>
3644777 3647112 <i>There weren't more than<br />a hundred frames</i>
3647196 3649281 <i>or something like that-four seconds.</i>
3649365 3653286 <i>And once that was shot,<br />then they took that optically,</i>
3653370 3656331 <i>and they added some distortion,<br />like whatever they did to the-</i>
3656414 3658291 <i>some video-type distortion...</i>
3658375 3662629 <i>to indicate that it was some kind<br />of a holographic type of effect.</i>
3662712 3667259 <i>And then they did a very simple double<br />exposure and printed it into the scene.</i>
3668009 3670387 <i>Right from that moment, we just knew.</i>
3670637 3673390 <i>We were all big fans<br />of</i> THX <i>and</i> American Graffiti.
3673640 3678144 <i>George was the first real director<br />that was doing sci-fi stuff...</i>
3678228 3679855 <i>and the first one-</i>
3679939 3683985 <i>We'd all tried to get work<br />on theatrical features,</i>
3684068 3687822 <i>but in Hollywood at that time,<br />the unions were really clamped down,</i>
3687905 3689258 <i>and they were only making things like</i>
3689282 3690717 The Poseidon Adventure<br /><i>and</i> Earthquake...
3690741 3692785 <i>and these big disaster pictures.</i>
3692868 3695288 <i>There was no place for things<br />like stop-motion animation...</i>
3695371 3697957 <i>and, other than Whitlock,<br />matte paintings.</i>
3698040 3701043 <i>So there was nothing really happening.</i>
3701127 3703296 <i>George just made it happen...</i>
3703379 3707217 <i>because he knew all these techniques<br />and just recycled them.</i>
3707301 3710887 <i>Studied how you put these kind of films<br />together and revitalized it...</i>
3710971 3713223 <i>and found all these guys that had been</i>
3713307 3715934 <i>doing all this junk in their garage<br />for years...</i>
3716018 3719187 <i>and gave them an opportunity to do it,<br />and it was terrific.</i>
3719271 3722107 <i>You knew from the minute<br />you were looking at the stuff</i>
3722190 3723817 <i>it was really gonna be cool and fun.</i>
3738291 3741127 BURTT: <i>To produce the sound<br />of the moving lightsabers...</i>
3741210 3744005 <i>I took the steady recording<br />of the hum and buzz...</i>
3744088 3746299 <i>and played it over<br />a speaker in a room...</i>
3746382 3749927 <i>and then rerecorded that sound<br />with another microphone.</i>
3750011 3753389 <i>I could take that microphone<br />and wave it around in the air,</i>
3753473 3756225 <i>and it would produce<br />what's called a Doppler effect-</i>
3756309 3758061 <i>that is a pitch shift...</i>
3758144 3761231 <i>because the sound is moving<br />relative to the microphone.</i>
3761315 3765277 <i>By doing that, I was able to take<br />the steady sound of a lightsaber...</i>
3766153 3770449 <i>and give it a sense of movement-<br />of coming to and fro or back and forth.</i>
3770532 3772951 <i>If you did it very quickly<br />in front of the speaker...</i>
3773035 3775537 <i>it would make the sound seem like</i>
3775621 3778415 <i>it was whizzing toward<br />someone in a fight.</i>
3779083 3782002 <i>It was a matter of not only<br />creating the sound</i>
3782086 3784880 <i>but also creating movement<br />of the sound,</i>
3784963 3787634 <i>which gave the lightsabers a basis...</i>
3787884 3791638 <i>for their noise and their credibility.</i>
3792972 3794516 MUREN:<br /><i>These little objects here...</i>
3794599 3798019 <i>we shot also motion control<br />with a camera just moving past them.</i>
3798103 3799396 <i>Probably shot about 10 of them</i>
3799479 3801159 <i>and used them over and<br />over and over again.</i>
3801231 3803459 <i>Looked like there were a few dozen<br />going past the camera...</i>
3803483 3807153 <i>as they slow down<br />from going into hyperspace.</i>
3815162 3818332 LUCAS: <i>He has a very good<br />navicomputer on the ship.</i>
3818416 3822586 <i>There's a thing there where Obi-Wan<br />Kenobi looks at him very skeptically,</i>
3822670 3825548 <i>which is one,<br />if you didn't know anything,</i>
3825631 3828551 <i>you'd just say,<br />"What is this clown talking about?"</i>
3828634 3831053 <i>But what he was really looking at is,<br />"I don't believe this.</i>
3831137 3835141 <i>I don't believe he has a navicomputer<br />that can do that, but okay."</i>
3835224 3836976 <i>He's a braggart.</i>
3837059 3840146 <i>Either way he's a braggart.</i><br />[CHUCKLES]
3840229 3842983 <i>I think it's sort of hotrod thinking.</i>
3843066 3846987 <i>It also comes from driving race cars.</i>
3847070 3849739 <i>Trying to take a windy course<br />and turn it into a straight line...</i>
3849990 3852033 <i>is all you spend your time doing.</i>
3852117 3854744 <i>The fastest car is the one<br />that can get the best line.</i>
3855036 3857539 <i>It doesn't necessarily<br />have the fastest engine.</i>
3864421 3865839 MUREN:<br /><i>These TIE ships were</i>
3865922 3867562 <i>really a very, very<br />fun thing in the show.</i>
3867591 3870386 <i>The design was strikingly original.</i>
3870470 3872972 <i>It was one of the things<br />that I loved working on.</i>
3873055 3877435 <i>Being real models, they were<br />probably about 18 inches wide.</i>
3877518 3879187 <i>Each wing was probably about</i>
3879270 3881355 <i>15 inches square<br />or something like that.</i>
3881439 3884484 <i>They were supported by a pole<br />and shot against a blue screen...</i>
3884567 3888529 <i>and attached to a motor<br />that we could move it around...</i>
3888613 3890156 <i>as well as moving the camera around,</i>
3890239 3892033 <i>move the camera toward it<br />and away from it.</i>
3892116 3896747 <i>That's how we shot all the models<br />for the first three</i> Star Wars <i>films.</i>
3901752 3903670 WATTS: Blue <i>screen's<br />very common in England.</i>
3903754 3907799 <i>We were supposed to do front<br />projection for the interior of the cockpit,</i>
3908050 3910344 <i>and that is part of what happened</i>
3910427 3912763 <i>and in actuality was<br />a blessing in disguise.</i>
3913013 3916266 <i>Originally,<br />ILM was to supply us with plates...</i>
3916350 3920229 <i>for all the interior cockpit</i><br />Millennium Falcon-<i> all of that.</i>
3920312 3922147 <i>We got the first one.</i>
3922231 3925568 <i>It was a plate that went pfft-took<br />about three seconds and then froze.</i>
3925652 3927403 <i>Can't use this.</i>
3927487 3931407 <i>It's not possible 'cause the actors<br />have to react to what's on.</i>
3932283 3934327 <i>So we went blue screen,</i>
3934410 3937539 <i>which we did forever afterwards<br />because it was found then...</i>
3937622 3940667 <i>that it's much easier,<br />more economic for ILM...</i>
3940750 3943711 <i>to create the image<br />to the scene as shot...</i>
3943795 3947507 <i>rather than have the actors react<br />to something that ILM's created.</i>
3947590 3950553 <i>Plates don't really work<br />because if you do a car plate...</i>
3950636 3952429 <i>you go out and shoot miles of it.</i>
3952513 3954431 <i>You got lots of run-in and run-out.</i>
3954515 3956600 <i>There it would pop up and be gone.</i>
3956684 3959436 <i>That's the only one we ever got.<br />We never did it.</i>
3959520 3962273 <i>We switched to blue screen.</i>
3967570 3970322 REYNOLDS: <i>With the</i><br />Millennium Falcon, <i>I can say...</i>
3970406 3975202 <i>that we had people going around<br />to salvage dumps...</i>
3975286 3977247 <i>collecting lorry loads<br />of rubbish actually,</i>
3977706 3980083 <i>truckloads of rubbish...</i>
3980166 3981751 <i>and bringing it to the studio.</i>
3981835 3985547 <i>That really made up the exterior<br />of the</i> Millennium Falcon.
3985630 3991094 <i>Because they're mostly bits<br />from cars and scrapyards.</i>
3991177 3993805 <i>We let them into the underside<br />of the</i> Millennium Falcon...
3993888 3996850 <i>and all over the thing, really,<br />and the controls even.</i>
3997100 3999644 <i>There are all sorts of things<br />that are really just junk...</i>
3999728 4003481 <i>that were sprayed and polished<br />and painted different colors.</i>
4003565 4006569 <i>We used a huge, huge amount.</i>
4006652 4009655 <i>And airplane parts.<br />We went to airplane breakers</i>
4009739 4011115 <i>and all sorts of places.</i>
4011198 4012700 <i>It literally was junk.</i>
4012783 4014744 <i>So if you look carefully at</i> Star Wars...
4014827 4017330 <i>there's a huge, huge amount of stuff<br />like that in it.</i>
4017413 4020708 <i>I think we actually-</i>
4022251 4025421 <i>A number of films have done that<br />in recent years.</i>
4025504 4030426 <i>I think it's true to say<br />that we did that in</i> Star Wars.
4030509 4033347 <i>A lot of people have picked up<br />on that actually.</i>
4065421 4070218 LUCAS: <i>I like to create a movie<br />that has the odor of the past.</i>
4071386 4074305 REYNOLDS: <i>I remember<br />one set we used loading pallets-</i>
4074389 4079185 <i>things that people use in warehouses<br />for moving stuff around.</i>
4079268 4083981 <i>We used that<br />and lit underneath it for the floors.</i>
4084232 4087486 <i>Things of that sort really<br />saved our bacon.</i>
4087569 4092574 <i>It really helped to do things<br />quickly and economically.</i>
4097996 4102751 <i>I think that George sees,<br />you know, if it's possible...</i>
4103210 4105546 <i>to do the shot with<br />plasticine and string,</i>
4105629 4107339 <i>I think that's what he would do.</i>
4107423 4110676 <i>If there's a way of doing<br />something cheaply...</i>
4110759 4113972 <i>to achieve a luxurious look,</i>
4114264 4116850 <i>then that's what George would go for.</i>
4116933 4119519 <i>That's really-</i>
4119602 4123523 <i>I think the moment you stop shooting,<br />if the set falls down,</i>
4123606 4127610 <i>then it succeeded<br />in what you set out to do...</i>
4127694 4130447 <i>because you've achieved<br />that atmosphere.</i>
4130530 4134409 <i>You've fooled people into believing...</i>
4134492 4136995 <i>it's some lavish environment...</i>
4137245 4141542 <i>that actually ideally only exists<br />for the duration of shooting.</i>
4149550 4153554 BURTT: <i>My first assignment was<br />to develop the voice of Chewbacca.</i>
4153637 4155639 <i>They wanted to have samples of what</i>
4155723 4157933 <i>Chewbacca might sound like<br />prior to shooting...</i>
4158017 4161812 <i>because it would be an aid<br />in the actual directing of the film.</i>
4161896 4164064 <i>It would help the actor, Peter Mayhew,</i>
4164148 4166358 <i>to actually perform<br />the voice of Chewbacca...</i>
4166442 4168653 <i>if we knew what Chewie<br />would sound like.</i>
4168737 4173366 <i>Peter Mayhew, once he got<br />really familiar with the sounds,</i>
4173450 4175827 <i>in fact,<br />in some of the later</i> Star Wars <i>films...</i>
4175911 4178455 <i>would actually make<br />the Chewbacca sounds himself.</i>
4178538 4180373 <i>He got pretty good at imitating it.</i>
4180457 4185003 <i>We never used his voice<br />for the actual track of the final movie,</i>
4185086 4190675 <i>but he picked up on the technique<br />and the voice texture of it...</i>
4190759 4193470 <i>and did a good imitation.</i>
4193553 4195848 MAYHEW:<br /><i>You have to make noises...</i>
4195932 4200436 <i>to get the reactions<br />from the other actors.</i>
4200520 4204816 <i>You can't stand there in a Wookiee suit<br />doing nothing,</i>
4204899 4206818 <i>so your body language is working.</i>
4206901 4212865 <i>You're also listening for the lines<br />that are coming off...</i>
4212949 4216869 <i>that you have worked out<br />what your reaction is going to be.</i>
4216953 4218412 Argh argh argh!
4218496 4219956 You said it, Chewie.
4220748 4225045 <i>When you've got polystyrene<br />close to your skin...</i>
4225128 4229883 <i>and there are holes in the mask<br />which allow sound out,</i>
4229967 4232845 <i>you've got to make fairly big noises.</i>
4233637 4236473 BURTT: <i>One of the other jobs<br />I had on</i> Star Wars-
4236557 4238934 <i>I did a lot of the photography<br />and creation...</i>
4239017 4241937 <i>of the little images<br />that go on people's viewscreens.</i>
4242020 4243605 <i>Because I had come out of USC</i>
4243689 4245858 <i>and had a background<br />in basic film-making,</i>
4245941 4247568 <i>I was sometimes<br />given assignments when</i>
4247651 4249696 <i>there was something<br />to be done right away.</i>
4249779 4254409 <i>I was, in some sense, a utility<br />production assistant at that time.</i>
4254492 4257871 <i>I got sent around to do<br />a lot of different jobs-</i>
4257954 4261875 <i>gather costumes,<br />take people out for hairdo tests,</i>
4261958 4264460 <i>purchase equipment.</i>
4264544 4266588 <i>Various miscellaneous jobs.</i>
4266671 4271551 <i>One of them, I got involved in the<br />actual photography and the creation...</i>
4271634 4275555 <i>of many of the little visuals<br />you see on the viewscreens-</i>
4275638 4279018 <i>the targeting devices<br />on board the X-wing fighters,</i>
4279101 4284440 <i>the little displays on the Death Star<br />that are inset into the control panels.</i>
4284523 4287401 <i>Many of these<br />were tiny rear-projection units-</i>
4287484 4291405 <i>That is, there's a tiny<br />16-millimeter movie projector...</i>
4291488 4294742 <i>built into the console<br />or behind the wall of the set...</i>
4294825 4298037 <i>projecting<br />a previously photographed movie...</i>
4298120 4302082 <i>of a computer graphic<br />or of a diagram or something...</i>
4302166 4304085 <i>into these little screens.</i>
4304169 4307672 <i>At the time, computer graphics<br />were virtually unknown.</i>
4307756 4309925 <i>We used them in a very primitive state</i>
4310008 4313219 <i>to create some of the video graphics<br />in the film.</i>
4313511 4316890 <i>The most notable example<br />is the Death Star battle plans...</i>
4316973 4320685 <i>which are displayed<br />by General Dodonna in the film.</i>
4320769 4325565 <i>It was a product of a very early piece<br />of computer animation which was done-</i>
4325649 4328652 <i>perhaps the first thing of its kind-<br />for the</i> Star Wars <i>movie...</i>
4328735 4330947 <i>and for future films in general.</i>
4334909 4337220 <i>In most film production,<br />you don't have all the time you want.</i>
4337244 4338913 <i>Sometimes the easiest thing to do,</i>
4338996 4340836 <i>and the only choice,<br />is to just do it yourself.</i>
4340915 4342792 <i>So a lot of the voices that get thrown in-</i>
4342875 4345628 <i>little incidental sounds like the mouse<br />robot going down the hallway-</i>
4345711 4349632 <i>was really just myself<br />doing funny little vocalizations...</i>
4349715 4353135 <i>and speeding the tape up and running it<br />backwards and so on to produce...</i>
4353594 4355221 <i>little tiny robot voices.</i>
4366775 4368615 FISHER:<br /><i>Somebody came on the set at this point.</i>
4368694 4371029 <i>George was very, very quiet-</i>
4371113 4374241 <i>so quiet that we had a journalist<br />visit the set...</i>
4374491 4377577 <i>and after three days<br />he asked which one was the director.</i>
4379788 4381790 <i>But he talks more now, George.</i>
4382958 4386087 LUCAS: <i>There's another story<br />going on here where Vader senses...</i>
4386170 4391551 <i>that Obi-Wan is on the Death Star.</i>
4391634 4394679 <i>One of the fun things for me<br />about this movie...</i>
4394762 4398266 <i>was that I was making Episode IV,</i>
4398558 4401686 <i>which is why I was so adamant<br />about having that on the film.</i>
4401769 4404272 <i>There's a lot of backstory that just-</i>
4404564 4406524 <i>It's interesting the film<br />was successful as it is,</i>
4406566 4409068 <i>and I hardly told any of the story.</i>
4409152 4413866 <i>But the other backstory is they had<br />this whole confrontation thing...</i>
4413949 4416201 <i>and Obi-Wan almost killed him.</i>
4416285 4417911 <i>He put him in the suit and everything,</i>
4417995 4419835 <i>and now they're<br />confronting each other again...</i>
4419872 4421999 <i>after all these years.</i>
4433677 4436180 THX <i>is very similar,<br />in a way, to this film...</i>
4436263 4439976 <i>in that it's the idea of throwing you<br />into a completely alien environment...</i>
4440060 4442979 <i>and not explaining anything<br />about how it works.</i>
4443354 4449110 <i>And I felt good about the way<br />it worked out in that movie,</i>
4449194 4452155 <i>and that gave me the confidence<br />to go on and continue to do it.</i>
4452238 4453448 <i>Sometimes I guess it works...</i>
4453907 4455241 <i>and sometimes it doesn't,</i>
4455325 4458244 <i>but it needs to be more about the story.</i>
4458328 4460622 <i>As I say, it's like going<br />through hyperspace.</i>
4460705 4463708 <i>You're getting from point A to point B.<br />That's the real issue.</i>
4463792 4466754 <i>And you're doing it because<br />you don't want to waste time,</i>
4466837 4469590 <i>and you want to be able to get<br />characters back and forth...</i>
4469673 4471842 <i>from halfway across the galaxy<br />in a few minutes.</i>
4472676 4475221 <i>You don't want to have to dwell on-</i>
4475304 4479183 <i>You either use the cinematic device<br />of chopping out all the travel,</i>
4480017 4483062 <i>or in science fiction...</i>
4483145 4488067 <i>you have a chance to invent some kind<br />of bogus technology that does it for you.</i>
4490820 4492589 <i>In this particular case,<br />in a lot of science fiction,</i>
4492613 4494366 <i>a lot of the technology isn't very bogus.</i>
4494616 4497828 <i>It's actually real.<br />Just nobody knows much about it.</i>
4499287 4500372 <i>You know, I mean-</i>
4500622 4504918 <i>And every year<br />there's more and more proof...</i>
4505001 4507921 <i>about traveling faster<br />than the speed of light...</i>
4508004 4511383 <i>and things that 20 years ago<br />were thought to be impossible.</i>
4519099 4522228 FISHER: <i>It was very hot for everybody<br />in these outfits.</i>
4526858 4532113 <i>When they said "cut" after each scene,</i>
4532196 4537076 <i>the first AD would always shout,<br />"Off with their heads,"</i>
4537160 4542748 <i>which would apply to stormtroopers,<br />Wookiees, robots.</i>
4542832 4547713 <i>At a certain point,<br />I would have liked it to apply to me,</i>
4547796 4549840 <i>but it was an amazing-</i>
4549923 4553760 <i>Very much so with the Ewoks,<br />who used to pass out with regularity.</i>
4556972 4560309 <i>Tony had this little board<br />he used to lay on...</i>
4561059 4563770 <i>because they couldn't<br />really take his outfit off.</i>
4563854 4565939 <i>It would take nine years,</i>
4566023 4568025 <i>so, "Head off."</i>
4568775 4571445 <i>People would bring him<br />a drink with a straw.</i>
4572446 4574949 <i>But fainting-</i>
4575033 4578453 <i>It was shot in the summer, I think.</i>
4579704 4583208 <i>I was lucky when you think<br />all I lacked was a bra.</i>
4597805 4600117 LUCAS: <i>With Darth Vader,<br />we had somebody who was very large,</i>
4600141 4604063 <i>and therefore it was much more difficult<br />for us to find somebody...</i>
4604146 4607066 <i>who could put a voice to that<br />because he didn't move around a lot.</i>
4607149 4609151 <i>The suit was very restrictive.</i>
4609235 4612029 <i>It was very hard for him to get<br />any kind of articulate gestures out...</i>
4612112 4614823 <i>that made sense in terms of acting.</i>
4628379 4631091 BURTT: <i>When you work on a film<br />like this in post-production...</i>
4631174 4634552 <i>you see often the dailies<br />or the film before it's edited together,</i>
4634970 4636846 <i>and you see outtakes and other shots.</i>
4636930 4640392 <i>When the stormtroopers<br />blow through the wall...</i>
4647065 4651194 <i>to come into the detention area<br />to get Han and Chewie,</i>
4651278 4654072 <i>there was another take where<br />the explosion on the set was so big...</i>
4654155 4658411 <i>that it actually blew out the set wall<br />on either side of the door,</i>
4658494 4662373 <i>exposing ordinary wooden<br />two-by-fours and studs in the wall.</i>
4662456 4664583 <i>But the stormtroopers,<br />being who they are,</i>
4664834 4667253 <i>they came charging through the holes<br />between the studs.</i>
4667336 4668730 <i>They came through<br />the wall everywhere.</i>
4668754 4670214 <i>Some of them tripped<br />and fell down.</i>
4670298 4673342 <i>Others fell on top of them.<br />They were relentless.</i>
4673426 4676095 <i>Even though the door hadn't opened,<br />but the wall had opened.</i>
4679056 4681559 HAMILL:<br /><i>It seemed to be a science fiction film</i>
4681642 4683603 <i>that had a sense of humor.</i>
4683854 4687399 <i>It was really funny-<br />robots arguing over whose fault it was.</i>
4687482 4690235 <i>It really reminded me of a fairy tale.</i>
4690319 4694114 <i>There was a farm boy and a princess.</i>
4694197 4697200 FISHER:<br /><i>I'm a very ungrateful hostage.</i>
4698201 4699953 This is some rescue! You came in here,
4700037 4701717 and you didn't have<br />a plan for getting out?
4701872 4703874 He's the brains, sweetheart!
4703957 4708837 LUCAS: <i>You actually believe<br />that she's a force to be reckoned with,</i>
4708920 4711424 <i>even against somebody<br />like Harrison Ford.</i>
4712050 4714302 FISHER:<br /><i>Grimacing.</i>
4716137 4719307 <i>I had to finally take gun lessons...</i>
4720308 4724228 <i>because I wasn't supposed to grimace<br />when I shot a gun...</i>
4724312 4729275 <i>because that would imply<br />that I was not familiar with the action,</i>
4729359 4731569 <i>which I wasn't.</i>
4731652 4734072 <i>So I took gun lessons<br />from the same guy...</i>
4734155 4738202 <i>that taught Robert De Niro<br />for</i> Taxi Driver.
4738285 4742122 <i>I grew to be very proud of my targets.</i>
4742206 4744208 <i>You shoot at targets.</i>
4744291 4746460 <i>I would take them home<br />to my then husband:</i>
4746543 4750130 <i>"Look how well I did<br />with my shotgun today."</i>
4750589 4753217 <i>But this is the movie where I grimace.</i>
4754343 4757221 <i>Mark is grimacing too.<br />I don't know why I had to-</i>
4757304 4759890 <i>I hope he had to<br />have those lessons too.</i>
4764896 4768650 <i>By the end, I was dreaming<br />in squibs and explosives.</i>
4769984 4773488 <i>In the trash compactor,<br />I think we all have wet suits on,</i>
4773571 4776408 <i>so maybe that starts soon.</i>
4777409 4779119 <i>That's so exciting.</i>
4779953 4781871 <i>Sometimes you can see<br />the two little dots</i>
4781955 4784666 <i>in the back of Chewbacca's throat.</i>
4786126 4788336 <i>I used to say<br />that maybe we could do a sequel...</i>
4788420 4792258 <i>where there was just shopping<br />and facials and stuff.</i>
4805813 4807565 HAMILL:<br /><i>People don't know that.</i>
4807648 4809108 <i>Did you know that was a dianoga?</i>
4809233 4811152 <i>I still think-Pardon me, George-</i>
4811235 4815531 [SINGING] <i>Could this be dianoga poo-poo?<br />Was a wonderful ad-lib...</i>
4815614 4817634 <i>because there's all this stuff<br />floating around in the water.</i>
4817658 4819161 [CHUCKLES]
4819411 4823039 <i>He looked at me<br />like I had just shot his pet dog...</i>
4823123 4824666 <i>and put his foot on my chest</i>
4824749 4827461 <i>and pushed me back<br />into the trash compactor.</i>
4827544 4829087 <i>I had to go back-</i>
4829171 4833049 <i>You have to keep getting changed<br />and your hair blown dry.</i>
4833133 4836428 <i>I'm sure he's in the zone<br />and he's seeing what he wants to do...</i>
4836511 4839681 <i>and we're just actors<br />trying to stave off boredom...</i>
4839764 4844311 <i>because we've been<br />in the trash compactor all morning.</i>
4849025 4852987 LUCAS: <i>Another thing I like about<br />this scene is that Chewie panics.</i>
4853070 4855072 <i>He doesn't like it here.</i>
4859202 4860995 <i>We didn't get a chance<br />really for Chewie...</i>
4861078 4863122 <i>to express himself<br />very much in the movie</i>
4863206 4865124 <i>in terms of his emotional feelings.</i>
4865208 4866685 <i>He usually goes along<br />with the program.</i>
4866709 4869629 <i>But this is the one place where he<br />doesn't go along with the program.</i>
4869712 4872340 <i>He just doesn't like it, wants to get out.</i>
4875344 4878305 <i>He's not always a brave Wookiee,<br />and I like that in him.</i>
4881433 4883101 McQUARRIE:<br /><i>Chewbacca was another guy...</i>
4883185 4888357 <i>who was kind of based on an illustration<br />from a science fiction novel of the past.</i>
4888440 4890192 <i>George had a Xerox copy...</i>
4890651 4894071 <i>of this thing<br />which showed a tall, hairy figure.</i>
4894154 4898450 <i>I did some sketches,<br />sort of variations on that theme.</i>
4898534 4902789 <i>George was talking about<br />a lemur look for him, big lemur eyes.</i>
4904165 4907001 <i>I did some real big ape like,</i>
4907085 4910129 <i>huge, muscular<br />sort of superhero figure...</i>
4910213 4913132 <i>with this lemur face<br />with a flak jacket on...</i>
4913216 4915593 <i>and all kinds of bandoliers<br />of ammunition</i>
4915677 4918054 <i>and so forth strapped around him.</i>
4918137 4920598 <i>The person that actually modeled him...</i>
4920682 4924060 <i>and who had done<br />the ape figures for</i> 2001...
4924143 4926104 <i>actually did him.</i>
4927481 4930276 LUCAS: <i>In all these films<br />I had limited resources,</i>
4930359 4933362 <i>so in this particular film<br />I was very careful.</i>
4933445 4936073 <i>The costumes are extremely simple.</i>
4936156 4938742 <i>The bad guys<br />all wear sort of gray uniforms,</i>
4938826 4941537 <i>and the most complicated fashion<br />statement</i>
4941620 4944290 <i>is Princess Leia's white dress.</i>
4957762 4960390 <i>The ancillary market<br />didn't exist at this point.</i>
4960473 4963476 <i>You showed it in a movie theater,<br />you hoped to make your money back,</i>
4963560 4967856 <i>and then your big chance at picking up<br />extra money was to sell it to television.</i>
4968565 4970275 <i>That was it.</i>
4970358 4972402 <i>There wasn't anything after that.</i>
4973695 4977198 <i>So the risk was quite big<br />on everybody's part.</i>
4978867 4981912 KURTZ: <i>The biggest thing<br />that people now don't realize...</i>
4982204 4987752 <i>is that actually $10 million in 1977<br />was a low-budget movie.</i>
4987835 4989587 <i>And, um-</i>
4989670 4993257 <i>Even if you were doing a comedy,<br />let alone a visual effects movie.</i>
4993341 4996802 <i>So in the day of $200 million movies,</i>
4996886 5001599 <i>getting that done for that money<br />and into the cinema on time,</i>
5001682 5005853 <i>given the whole series of problems we<br />had and how little money there was,</i>
5005936 5009274 <i>was probably one of the things<br />I'm most proud of.</i>
5019910 5023664 DANIELS: <i>Since most of my scenes<br />were alone with R2-D2,</i>
5023747 5026333 <i>who's totally silent throughout filming,</i>
5026416 5028960 <i>I was talking to myself...</i>
5029211 5031838 <i>and I would write out his dialogue<br />in the sense of...</i>
5033632 5036969 <i>"I mustn't go crazy here. I must know<br />what I'm saying and he's saying to me."</i>
5037220 5039198 <i>But I did spend days and days alone<br />and days and days</i>
5039222 5040890 <i>becoming more and more of a prop.</i>
5040973 5047313 <i>Eventually, there was<br />some kind of party at Elstree,</i>
5047397 5052193 <i>and I got some matches printed up<br />as a kind of joke,</i>
5052276 5054529 <i>but not really a joke.</i>
5054612 5059617 <i>And they just had the simple words<br />"3PO is human."</i>
5059701 5062745 <i>A simple message, but straight<br />from the heart-mine, not his.</i>
5062829 5065207 <i>What happened was<br />for days afterwards,</i>
5065290 5067459 <i>people would come up to me and say,</i>
5067543 5069896 <i>"Tone, you got any more of those books<br />of matches 'cause they're"</i>
5069920 5071588 <i>really neat and everything...</i>
5071672 5073632 <i>"and it'd be nice to have one<br />as a souvenir."</i>
5073716 5076969 <i>Then they'd go away,<br />and the next day...</i>
5077219 5079888 <i>totally forgotten the message.</i><br />[CHUCKLES]
5088689 5091250 HAMILL: <i>Just the fact that we were<br />traveling around in spaceships</i>
5091276 5092861 <i>made it science fiction,</i>
5092944 5094755 <i>but when people thought<br />of science fiction then,</i>
5094779 5097699 <i>I guess they were thinking<br />more along the lines</i> of 2001...
5097782 5099451 <i>or</i> Planet of the Apes.
5099534 5101035 <i>This one was hilarious...</i>
5101494 5103371 <i>and reminded me</i><br />of Wizard of Oz <i>really,</i>
5103455 5106458 <i>in terms of a young person<br />being swept away on a big adventure.</i>
5106541 5108918 <i>And it seemed like<br />the cinematic equivalent...</i>
5109002 5111337 <i>of what Frank Baum did in his books,</i>
5111421 5116634 <i>in that it was the environment<br />that was the leading character really,</i>
5116718 5120055 <i>so that once the story of Luke was over,</i>
5120306 5122433 <i>there were many more stories to tell.</i>
5123058 5124769 MUREN:<br /><i>This is a matte painting that</i>
5124852 5127021 <i>was used to extend the shaft there.</i>
5127271 5128814 <i>It's actually on a sound stage.</i>
5128898 5132818 <i>Just a little part in the frame<br />is all that was built,</i>
5132902 5136530 <i>and the rest was all painted<br />on a piece of glass and added later on.</i>
5137698 5141076 <i>There are, in this sequence though,<br />some photo cutouts in that...</i>
5141368 5145499 <i>or painted flats in the background...</i>
5145582 5149544 <i>that we didn't do, but it's an idea<br />of a big, full-sized matte painting.</i>
5150796 5154800 <i>They get back to-When they're<br />walking around that thing again.</i>
5159513 5161097 <i>There were such wonderful artists</i>
5161181 5163058 <i>in England where they<br />made these movies.</i>
5163308 5165852 <i>They worked<br />the old apprentice program...</i>
5165936 5168063 <i>where they worked for years and years<br />under someone</i>
5168146 5170440 <i>before they became skilled enough...</i>
5170524 5173694 <i>to do the work on their own.</i>
5173778 5177824 <i>They started with theatrical<br />backgrounds hundreds of years ago...</i>
5177907 5181452 <i>and trickeries and everything<br />for stage sets.</i>
5181536 5184789 <i>That same craftsmanship<br />has worked its way into the movies.</i>
5184872 5187750 <i>A lot of the sets you see<br />in the</i> Star Wars <i>films...</i>
5187834 5191879 <i>and in a lot of other British films<br />that were made around that time...</i>
5191963 5196008 <i>are full of backgrounds that look like<br />they're sets, but they're paintings-</i>
5196092 5198469 <i>little parts of them<br />where they could get away with it.</i>
5198553 5202474 <i>It saves enormous amounts of money<br />and adds a lot of scope to the films.</i>
5202558 5209481 <i>The sets-A lot of the set makers<br />could also make the rock formations.</i>
5210649 5214027 <i>All were just very, very skilled people.</i>
5215529 5218740 <i>This whole British attitude-certainly<br />George had an awful lot to do with it,</i>
5218824 5222953 <i>but the technicians there<br />and set makers and all...</i>
5223370 5225455 <i>are just so good.</i>
5229711 5232922 KURTZ: <i>The British crew<br />was quite bemused by this project.</i>
5233006 5236634 <i>I think they felt it was<br />an unknown quantity.</i>
5236718 5239929 <i>They couldn't see from the script<br />how it could possibly work.</i>
5240013 5241907 <i>We were talking about only<br />the live-action scenes.</i>
5241931 5243826 <i>They didn't know anything<br />about the visual effects.</i>
5243850 5246811 <i>They hadn't seen any drawings or<br />anything except for the art department.</i>
5246895 5249606 <i>So it's, I suppose,<br />somewhat natural that</i>
5249689 5251858 <i>there might be a lot of head scratching.</i>
5251941 5254737 <i>George had come out<br />of five guys and a camera...</i>
5254820 5256739 <i>and everybody did everything...</i>
5256822 5260743 <i>to this system where every department<br />was very carefully defined...</i>
5260826 5263078 <i>and there wasn't any crossover.</i>
5263162 5265080 LUCAS:<br /><i>I was an American director.</i>
5265164 5269043 <i>I was very young<br />and I had a beard and long hair.</i>
5269793 5272087 <i>So I had a bunch of strikes against me.</i>
5273213 5275966 <i>British crews aren't<br />very forgiving anyway.</i>
5276050 5278528 <i>They're very professional, they're very<br />good, and they're very talented,</i>
5278552 5282182 <i>but they definitely look<br />at the pecking order...</i>
5282474 5284314 <i>very different than we do<br />in the United States.</i>
5287604 5290023 <i>At 5:30 we had to stop,</i>
5290106 5292984 <i>unless we were in the middle of a shot.</i>
5293068 5297155 <i>I could ask the crew for an extra<br />15 minutes, and they'd vote on it.</i>
5297238 5299240 <i>But they always voted me down.</i>
5299491 5302118 <i>So I knew I wasn't gonna get<br />my extra 15 minutes.</i>
5302202 5304120 <i>Wherever I was at 5:30,<br />I had to stop.</i>
5304204 5309961 <i>There was one time in Obi-Wan<br />Kenobi's house where it was 5:00.</i>
5310044 5311796 <i>I had to shoot this scene.</i>
5311879 5315007 <i>So what I did is made<br />a very elaborate dolly shot...</i>
5315091 5317093 <i>that had the wide shot,<br />the medium shot,</i>
5317176 5319095 <i>the close-ups and everything<br />in this one shot...</i>
5319178 5321889 <i>and ended up shooting until about 7:00.</i>
5321973 5324684 <i>The crew was completely furious<br />with me.</i>
5324767 5326686 <i>But I did get the day's work done.</i>
5326769 5329122 <i>In a normal crew, in a normal situation,<br />you simply ask them,</i>
5329146 5331315 <i>"We're in trouble.<br />We have to get off this set.</i>
5331399 5332984 <i>I need the extra time to do this."</i>
5333067 5334861 <i>They give it to you.</i>
5338949 5341159 FISHER:<br /><i>This was right in the beginning also.</i>
5341243 5345163 <i>This is where I thought they'll just<br />let me splat against the wall...</i>
5345247 5348083 <i>and bring in Jodie Foster<br />'cause I didn't lose the weight.</i>
5348166 5352045 <i>Oh. And I also said, like at the time<br />Johnny Carson was still on,</i>
5352129 5354923 <i>and I would say, "Here they come!"...</i>
5355007 5357009 <i>about the stormtroopers.</i>
5357843 5360512 <i>See? Look at the big grimacing<br />with the lower teeth.</i>
5360595 5363641 <i>This was not my favorite moment.</i><br />[CHUCKLES]
5363725 5367812 <i>My expectation was<br />splat, bring in the new girl.</i>
5367895 5370940 <i>A lot of this kind of acting<br />is sort of reacting.</i>
5371024 5375862 <i>I mean, you're in these sort of very-</i>
5376904 5380825 <i>There's squibs going off,<br />and you're running around...</i>
5380908 5383953 <i>and you're yelling at people a lot,</i>
5385705 5391837 <i>so there's no time<br />for really any moments.</i>
5392838 5397009 <i>There was a moment<br />that I finally had in</i> Empire, <i>I think,</i>
5397468 5401555 <i>and in the third one with the Ewok.</i>
5401638 5404933 <i>But you never slow up long enough<br />to be able to make...</i>
5405768 5408937 <i>what I believe I'd call choices<br />or anything like that.</i>
5410773 5413150 BURTT: <i>Here's a jump cut.<br />See right there?</i>
5413317 5415527 <i>That's a jump cut on Alec Guinness.</i>
5415611 5417197 <i>He held the handle.</i>
5417280 5419616 <i>The technician put the stick in it<br />and then walked away...</i>
5419699 5421701 <i>and they cut those frames out.</i>
5421785 5425330 <i>He jumps just a little bit in order to get<br />that rod in there for the front projection.</i>
5429667 5432337 DIAMOND: <i>The hardest thing<br />for me on the first fights-</i>
5432587 5435840 <i>Darth Vader was a very heavy man.</i>
5435924 5438635 <i>Obi-Wan Kenobi was a gentleman...</i>
5438718 5441805 <i>who had done some<br />fencing in the theater.</i>
5441888 5443933 <i>I'm the only man who would wish I could</i>
5444016 5446727 <i>reshoot the first fight when<br />you first saw it...</i>
5446811 5448729 <i>because I had to teach them<br />to stop before</i>
5448813 5450898 <i>they touched, 'cause<br />the blades were breaking.</i>
5450981 5453192 <i>We broke so many blades...</i>
5453275 5456862 <i>because Dave was heavy and strong.</i>
5456946 5459365 <i>He couldn't really pull it enough.</i>
5459615 5461784 <i>If we could reshoot it again,<br />I would love to do it,</i>
5461867 5465996 <i>'cause I really could do it properly this<br />time because we learned from that.</i>
5466080 5467998 <i>Then the next fight,<br />the next two pictures,</i>
5468082 5471294 <i>that provided you had material<br />which didn't snap,</i>
5471378 5474005 <i>you could get better action,<br />better fights.</i>
5474089 5476550 <i>So we ended up with<br />what I call fishing rods</i>
5476633 5478635 <i>'cause they're made of carbon fiber.</i>
5478718 5480720 <i>It literally was a fishing rod.</i>
5480804 5482722 <i>We didn't have to rotate it.</i>
5482806 5486184 <i>The other thing on</i> Empire,<br /><i>we were told we couldn't fight</i>
5486268 5488770 <i>behind stairs and things like that...</i>
5488854 5492774 <i>because they lost the line<br />for doing the animation.</i>
5492858 5494693 <i>So we were very careful.</i>
5494776 5497380 <i>Everything was in front of the buildings<br />and in front of the metalwork</i>
5497404 5499240 <i>and in front of it.</i>
5499323 5502243 <i>But then we discovered,<br />when we did</i> Return of the Jedi,
5502326 5505204 <i>that it was possible now<br />to go behind all this thing...</i>
5505288 5507248 <i>and still keep the line for the blades.</i>
5507331 5511127 <i>But it was trial and error<br />in the first instance.</i>
5519302 5521762 LUCAS: <i>The idea that you could learn</i>
5521846 5524182 <i>how to become one<br />with the Force at will,</i>
5524265 5526310 <i>which means<br />to give up your corporeal body...</i>
5526393 5530814 <i>and become part of an energy field<br />just by willing it to happen,</i>
5530898 5533275 <i>came out of a Buddhist idea.</i>
5533358 5536862 <i>Basically it worked<br />for the plot device here.</i>
5536945 5541241 <i>The whole subtext of the Force...</i>
5541325 5545495 <i>and the ability to join the Force<br />grew out of that reality,</i>
5545746 5547623 <i>which is a subtext<br />that is one of those things</i>
5547706 5549708 <i>that's kind of confusing<br />to a lot of people.</i>
5552837 5555465 <i>One of the issues that's<br />in the backstory...</i>
5555715 5560303 <i>is the idea that the Force surrounds you<br />and is part of you...</i>
5560386 5563473 <i>and when you die,<br />you become one with the Force.</i>
5563765 5566893 <i>But it's an energy field,<br />so you just become energy,</i>
5566976 5570313 <i>and you don't have your individuality<br />or personality any more.</i>
5570396 5573024 <i>You're just energy,<br />and the energy comes and goes.</i>
5573107 5576945 <i>It's partly generated by life<br />and partly influenced by life.</i>
5587748 5591752 <i>The one who ultimately finds out<br />the way to do it is Qui-Gon Jinn.</i>
5591835 5594755 <i>He teaches Yoda.<br />Yoda teaches Obi-Wan.</i>
5594838 5597800 <i>And then Obi-Wan and Yoda<br />together at the end...</i>
5597883 5601428 <i>help the old<br />Anakin Skywalker come back...</i>
5601512 5604181 <i>and keep his individuality<br />while he was part of the Force.</i>
5604890 5607370 MUREN: <i>The Death Star model<br />was probably about three feet wide.</i>
5607394 5610438 <i>Most of the planets<br />that are in the show though...</i>
5610522 5613167 <i>are paintings or photographs of little<br />balls that have been painted...</i>
5613191 5616069 <i>and stuck onto black cards<br />with stars painted on them.</i>
5616152 5618196 <i>But the Death Star<br />was an actual model we made,</i>
5618280 5620865 <i>'cause we had so many shots<br />where you were approaching it...</i>
5620949 5623159 <i>and the sun is viewed<br />in different angles on it...</i>
5623243 5625120 <i>that we wanted to be able<br />to move in on it</i>
5625203 5627205 <i>and give a sense<br />of perspective changes...</i>
5627289 5629082 <i>that you wouldn't get<br />from still photographs.</i>
5631167 5633921 FISHER:<br /><i>God knows what this is,</i>
5634005 5637008 <i>but I think I'm kind of maternal<br />toward him.</i>
5643597 5649103 <i>But I think, too, they based the rest<br />of the relationships in two and three...</i>
5649186 5651939 <i>on how we behaved together<br />in this movie.</i>
5653316 5655109 MUREN: <i>It was really difficult<br />for all of us</i>
5655192 5657028 <i>to understand what<br />George was talking about...</i>
5657111 5660114 <i>when he was saying<br />that these TIE ships should fly fast.</i>
5660197 5663368 <i>'Cause fast to us meant three or four<br />seconds to go through the shot,</i>
5663452 5665954 <i>and George wanted it to go through<br />in half a second.</i>
5666038 5668516 <i>So very quickly, boom, you just<br />see a glimpse of this racing through.</i>
5668540 5671043 <i>One way we accomplished<br />the sense of speed</i>
5671126 5673378 <i>was to move the background<br />instead of the model.</i>
5673462 5675964 <i>So there's times when you see<br />the TIE ships slowly moving by,</i>
5676048 5677650 <i>but the stars are racing by<br />in the background,</i>
5677674 5679343 <i>and that gave that<br />same sense of speed.</i>
5679426 5680987 <i>The advantage was<br />it gave a sense of speed</i>
5681011 5682530 <i>when you could see<br />the shape of the TIE ship.</i>
5682554 5685223 <i>The other way,<br />all we had were a bunch of blurs.</i>
5685974 5689562 KURTZ: <i>One of the other areas<br />that we had a very hard time with...</i>
5689645 5693608 <i>was the explosions that were<br />supposed to be in outer space,</i>
5693900 5697153 <i>which would mean that<br />all of the explosive material</i>
5697236 5699155 <i>would go out in all directions.</i>
5699238 5702408 <i>We needed to find some way<br />of doing these explosions...</i>
5702492 5707205 <i>where the stuff didn't look like it all<br />fell down on the ground with gravity.</i>
5707288 5714253 <i>So we found a facility which had<br />a 50-foot height to the rafters.</i>
5714337 5716173 <i>We put the camera on the floor,</i>
5716256 5718300 <i>shooting straight up<br />through a piece of glass-</i>
5718384 5720427 <i>a high-speed camera-<br />and then put</i>
5720511 5722554 <i>the explosive charges<br />up in the rafters...</i>
5722638 5725391 <i>so that they would blow out<br />in all directions.</i>
5725474 5730187 <i>We spent days shooting explosions<br />of all kinds and sizes...</i>
5730270 5733065 <i>just to see if it would work.</i>
5733148 5735150 <i>In the end, that did work.</i>
5740948 5743284 RICHARD CHEW:<br /><i>When I was assigned...</i>
5743368 5745537 <i>the sequence that we called<br />the gun port sequence,</i>
5745620 5752085 <i>because all I had was blue screen<br />material of our actors on their set,</i>
5752168 5755380 <i>the best way for George<br />to convey to me what he was after...</i>
5755463 5757441 <i>was what he had put together<br />of the newsreel footage...</i>
5757465 5760468 <i>of dogfights from World War II,<br />because it's so kinetic.</i>
5760552 5764431 <i>You have to see it in order to<br />understand what he was after.</i>
5764514 5768435 <i>You don't get that idea at all<br />from the script of what it would be.</i>
5768518 5772940 <i>It was just the movement of it<br />that led me to understand,</i>
5773023 5779321 <i>"Oh, okay. What you're after<br />is really leading the eye from cut to cut."</i>
5781574 5783784 LUCAS: <i>To do a storyboard didn't<br />tell you very much.</i>
5783868 5785411 <i>It was a very static thing.</i>
5785494 5788372 <i>It just has the guy in the foreground<br />as the ship goes through,</i>
5788456 5792626 <i>but I had to be able to say, "Look.<br />This is what I want it to do in time."</i>
5792710 5796046 <i>I couldn't really be sloppy about,<br />you know-</i>
5796130 5799509 <i>"Oh, shoot that for a couple seconds."</i>
5799593 5800760 <i>I had to say...</i>
5801219 5803472 <i>exactly how many frames<br />it was gonna be...</i>
5803555 5805474 <i>and then how it fit into the next shot...</i>
5805557 5808477 <i>and how each shot fit together<br />and then how that all played.</i>
5809603 5812230 <i>It was designed more<br />as an editorial exercise</i>
5812314 5815567 <i>than as a static shot-by-shot exercise.</i>
5815650 5820113 <i>It was more about the flow of the motion<br />than what the individual shots were,</i>
5820197 5823618 <i>and I was able to achieve that<br />by cutting together...</i>
5823701 5827622 <i>lots of old documentary footage<br />and stuff to have movement.</i>
5827705 5830249 <i>I'm sure it had been done before.</i>
5830333 5833544 <i>In animation they call it a leica reel,</i>
5833628 5838049 <i>which is they take their storyboards,<br />and they cut them together.</i>
5838132 5840635 <i>Sometimes they do little bits<br />of animation that go in there...</i>
5840718 5843137 <i>to get a sense of how<br />everything is working.</i>
5843513 5847391 <i>So it isn't completely unknown<br />in the animation world.</i>
5849227 5852439 <i>Now we can do it<br />with digital visualization process...</i>
5852523 5856068 <i>by which we can use<br />computer animation to shoot a scene.</i>
5856151 5858654 <i>But in those days<br />I either did it with old footage-</i>
5858737 5860322 <i>We did some animation.</i>
5860405 5864201 <i>We did little tiny models<br />that we shot on video sometimes.</i>
5864284 5866164 <i>There's lots of different ways<br />to accomplish it,</i>
5866245 5868705 <i>but it does limit how you can tell a story,</i>
5868789 5871375 <i>whereas now that we're doing<br />everything completely animated,</i>
5871458 5874044 <i>I can pretty much shoot<br />anything any way I want.</i>
5874127 5876838 <i>I'm not limited to chases and things.</i>
5877089 5879551 <i>Like the snow battle in the second film...</i>
5879634 5883555 <i>where it's just so specific that there is<br />no footage that exists that's like that.</i>
5886474 5887642 MUREN:<br /><i>Most of the planets...</i>
5888059 5891187 <i>in the original</i> Star Wars <i>film<br />were paintings...</i>
5891271 5893356 <i>that were done on sheets of glass</i>
5893439 5895525 <i>by Harrison Ellenshaw<br />or Ralph McQuarrie.</i>
5895608 5900363 <i>Then when we redid<br />the film many years later on,</i>
5900446 5902046 <i>we did some with<br />computer-graphic planets</i>
5902115 5903635 <i>to get a little bit of motion on them.</i>
5908747 5911500 <i>This is Lorne Peterson<br />down in Guatemala.</i>
5912334 5916338 <i>He was down there<br />with a camera crew and shot that.</i>
5916422 5918549 <i>He was one of our model makers,<br />and it's pretty funny:</i>
5918632 5921552 <i>He probably made the model<br />that he's shooting at there.</i>
5924346 5926765 <i>The way it kind of worked is,<br />at this time,</i>
5926849 5928601 <i>I was shooting the night shift.</i>
5928684 5932439 <i>We only had one real flexible camera<br />we could shoot with.</i>
5932522 5935275 <i>Richard was shooting in the daytime,<br />I was shooting at nighttime,</i>
5935358 5938737 <i>so we could use the camera<br />24 hours a day.</i>
5938820 5942032 <i>He'd come in and give me<br />two or three different storyboards-</i>
5942115 5944242 <i>George would personally-</i>
5944326 5947537 <i>"and say," We're gonna try to shoot<br />this element and this element...</i>
5947621 5949748 <i>and this TIE ship and this one.</i>
5949831 5951750 <i>"How many do you think<br />you can get tonight?"</i>
5951833 5954794 <i>I'd do what I could, maybe get two<br />or three of them in one night.</i>
5954878 5956880 <i>Other times I may only get one a night.</i>
5957756 5961177 <i>That was sort of how we worked it-<br />working directly with him.</i>
5961260 5965181 <i>He would describe what he wanted<br />and then go off,</i>
5965264 5967558 <i>and I'd be on my own to shoot the shots</i>
5967642 5969769 <i>and give the performance<br />that he was after.</i>
5970394 5973189 <i>Later on, it would go to<br />the optical department,</i>
5973272 5975399 <i>and they would combine<br />all the elements together,</i>
5975483 5978361 <i>and if it was all done right,<br />it looked pretty amazingly real.</i>
5985409 5988413 EDLUND: <i>We were kind of like<br />a weird fraternity</i>
5988497 5990374 <i>of robotic photography nuts.</i>
5990457 5996963 <i>We had lots of ideas of how to do<br />weird kinds of photography...</i>
5997214 6003762 <i>using high technology and<br />surplus equipment to strap together...</i>
6003845 6007974 <i>to make different kind of images.</i>
6008225 6011478 Star Wars <i>came along<br />at just the perfect time for us.</i>
6011561 6014857 McQUARRIE: <i>We would go to<br />meetings-Joe Johnston and I-</i>
6014941 6020405 <i>and look at drawings<br />and talk about what to do next.</i>
6020488 6024117 <i>Joe would bring in something,<br />and I would say,</i>
6024200 6026661 <i>"Oh, I think that's great, but" -</i>
6027995 6030164 <i>I'd make a drawing of it myself,</i>
6030248 6033584 <i>and Joe would do<br />the same with my things.</i>
6033668 6036003 <i>He took the sandcrawler, for instance,</i>
6036087 6039465 <i>and made it a more boxy,<br />taller thing than I had,</i>
6039549 6041301 <i>which I think worked fine.</i>
6041385 6042803 <i>I liked it.</i>
6044555 6050227 <i>I would take his drawings of the X-wing<br />and put my own look to them-</i>
6050310 6053856 <i>a little more streamlined,<br />a little more sport car-like.</i>
6054481 6057901 <i>I kind of thought we were all<br />working on the same movie,</i>
6057985 6059945 <i>and we just had fun-</i>
6060028 6063323 <i>whatever occurred to us we should do.</i>
6087849 6092604 FORD: <i>I always thought the character<br />Luke Skywalker was George.</i>
6093563 6095566 <i>George growing up.</i>
6095649 6101280 <i>George facing a conflict<br />and the need to prove himself.</i>
6101363 6104867 <i>And he did.</i>
6106660 6107953 <i>Powerfully.</i>
6108037 6110790 <i>You'd see the character<br />of Luke Skywalker</i>
6110873 6114460 <i>change from one film to the next...</i>
6114543 6118631 <i>and develop in much the same way<br />George was developing.</i>
6129476 6132354 LUCAS: <i>There was no special effects<br />companies in those days,</i>
6132437 6135023 <i>and the studio's special effects<br />department had been disbanded.</i>
6135106 6137234 <i>There were a few matte painters<br />still left,</i>
6137317 6140445 <i>but basically there was no industry.</i>
6140529 6143114 <i>Part of that was because<br />of the expense,</i>
6143406 6146409 <i>and part of it was that<br />the American taste-</i>
6146493 6150081 <i>the culture had gone toward<br />very realistic looking films in the '50s.</i>
6150373 6154043 <i>Very psychologically-driven,<br />contemporary movies.</i>
6154126 6157588 <i>But as a result,<br />special effects just disappeared.</i>
6158714 6162760 <i>So trying to start that all over again<br />was a very, very big challenge.</i>
6163678 6166389 <i>I knew cinema, so I knew<br />kind of how to do everything,</i>
6166472 6170393 <i>but the intricacies...</i>
6170476 6173563 <i>and the overwhelming challenge<br />I wasn't really aware of.</i>
6173646 6175898 <i>I was pretty naive at that point.</i>
6175982 6178485 <i>In the beginning, I was gonna<br />do it for three million dollars.</i>
6178569 6181530 <i>When I got the script, it moved to 10.</i>
6181613 6185033 <i>"I said," I'll hire a bunch of people...</i>
6185158 6187953 <i>and we'll put them together and make<br />a group and make the movie."</i>
6189997 6192541 <i>I knew there were<br />very few people out there.</i>
6192624 6195836 <i>So I went around to the commercial<br />companies and everything...</i>
6195919 6198088 <i>and picked the few people that had</i>
6198171 6201508 <i>any experience at all<br />doing special effects.</i>
6201592 6203845 <i>We built a company up out of it.</i>
6203928 6207473 <i>I think the average age at that point<br />was about 23, 24 years old,</i>
6207557 6209475 <i>when they were all kids out of college.</i>
6209559 6211477 JOHN DYKSTRA: <i>When Gary and</i>
6211561 6213313 <i>George and I spoke the first time...</i>
6213396 6214939 <i>about this</i> Star Wars <i>story,</i>
6215023 6219652 <i>we talked about how the camera<br />would be in motion with the aircraft,</i>
6219736 6222655 <i>much like gun cameras were<br />in the Second World War.</i>
6222739 6224866 <i>So that was really the conceit:</i>
6224949 6227619 <i>How do we get these images on film...</i>
6227702 6229412 <i>that make the audience feel as though</i>
6229495 6231916 <i>they're a participant<br />on an individual basis?</i>
6232666 6235544 KURTZ: <i>No one had ever tried to do<br />the visual effects side</i>
6235628 6237087 <i>the way we were proposing it.</i>
6237171 6240716 <i>We approached the visual effects<br />as a grand experiment, saying,</i>
6240799 6242760 <i>"Can we do this with<br />a lot of people who work"</i>
6242843 6244929 <i>on architectural models<br />and in commercials...</i>
6245012 6247139 <i>and have never made<br />feature films before?</i>
6247222 6250476 <i>"But we can approach everything<br />in a new and unique way."</i>
6250559 6252645 <i>Even though each<br />of the techniques that we used</i>
6252728 6254730 <i>was not new-<br />it had been used by somebody-</i>
6254813 6257776 <i>but we just combined them in a way<br />that hadn't been used before.</i>
6258902 6262614 <i>We realized, because there were<br />hundreds of individual shots,</i>
6262697 6264950 <i>that we would never<br />have time or the money</i>
6265033 6267619 <i>to do them all in the traditional way.</i>
6267702 6270956 <i>So we would have to,<br />in effect, "library" things.</i>
6271039 6274793 <i>We'd shoot elements<br />and put them away in the library...</i>
6274876 6276962 <i>and use them for as many shots<br />as we could.</i>
6277045 6280256 <i>A lot of the shots, for instance,<br />of the X-wing fighters flying,</i>
6281049 6283134 <i>we would shoot a fighter on the stand,</i>
6283218 6286514 <i>and the only computer aspect<br />to the whole thing was...</i>
6287473 6290726 <i>controlling servo motors-<br />that it would remember what it did.</i>
6290810 6294063 <i>We went back to the idea<br />of the operators using a joystick...</i>
6294146 6297608 <i>and actually<br />driving the shot mechanically by hand,</i>
6297692 6301529 <i>but the computer remembered<br />what happened-those servo motors.</i>
6301612 6303692 <i>So we could duplicate it<br />again and again and again...</i>
6303948 6305658 <i>for the different passes.</i>
6305741 6308911 <i>And that was the breakthrough<br />in that technique,</i>
6308995 6312040 <i>because we could<br />do one pass lit normally,</i>
6312124 6315502 <i>and we could do one pass<br />lit for another shot,</i>
6315585 6317504 <i>and we can do<br />another pass for the engines-</i>
6317587 6319589 <i>if you saw the engines glowing.</i>
6320716 6324136 MUREN: <i>We were learning<br />to maneuver them around...</i>
6324219 6326763 <i>and shoot at a very, very slow speed...</i>
6326847 6329224 <i>that when you projected it back<br />at a faster speed,</i>
6329307 6332561 <i>it looked like the spaceships<br />were racing by at a fast speed.</i>
6332644 6334604 <i>But actually, it might take two minutes</i>
6334688 6336732 <i>for the camera and model<br />to run very slowly.</i>
6336815 6339610 <i>But when you projected it back,<br />the shot goes by in two seconds.</i>
6347577 6349912 <i>This is the X-wings opening up,</i>
6349996 6352832 <i>which I remember<br />very clearly shooting in '76,</i>
6352915 6354709 <i>but now redoing them.</i>
6354792 6357229 <i>They were a little funny<br />when we did them the first time around.</i>
6357253 6361007 <i>They sort of jumped and weren't quite<br />as realistic looking as this stuff is.</i>
6361090 6363968 <i>Now we start the big final battle-<br />the final space battle.</i>
6364052 6366893 <i>Most of the shots at the beginning here-<br />actually during the battle too-</i>
6366930 6369683 <i>were redone to make the shots better</i>
6369767 6373270 <i>than what we'd originally done<br />in '76, '77.</i>
6373353 6376565 <i>They were done with computer<br />graphics, the way we do things now.</i>
6376648 6379359 <i>The close-ups are all<br />the original photography.</i>
6379610 6382321 <i>In certain cases<br />the background ships are all new.</i>
6384114 6385824 <i>A lot of the backgrounds<br />in the sequence</i>
6385908 6387826 <i>are the original backgrounds<br />that we did-</i>
6388660 6390871 <i>that were actually photographs of</i>
6390954 6394000 <i>the Death Star pieces<br />that we had made...</i>
6394084 6398296 <i>and photographed and then replicated<br />in 8-by-10 photos...</i>
6398379 6401007 <i>and stuck them<br />onto a big hemisphere...</i>
6401091 6404094 <i>probably about six or eight feet across<br />and then rephotographed that.</i>
6404177 6406721 <i>These pieces were modularly made.</i>
6406805 6409099 <i>They were all about one foot square...</i>
6409182 6410826 <i>and probably about six or eight<br />different designs,</i>
6410850 6412227 <i>and we made hundreds of them.</i>
6412310 6414938 <i>When you put them all together,<br />like a checkerboard,</i>
6415063 6416606 <i>and get back and look at it,</i>
6416689 6418775 <i>it looks like this massive set<br />of buildings</i>
6418858 6420653 <i>and structures<br />and you don't know what.</i>
6420736 6423781 <i>But they're really very few<br />number of different pieces...</i>
6423864 6426700 <i>just copied over and over<br />and over again.</i>
6428702 6430621 <i>The set is pretty small.</i>
6430704 6434959 <i>Most of these explosions that you see<br />are done on this little miniature set...</i>
6435042 6439380 <i>with the little Death Star pieces<br />that are in a tiny little scale.</i>
6442675 6444426 <i>The pieces are about a foot square...</i>
6444718 6448056 <i>that are probably representing<br />200 or 300 feet-each square.</i>
6448140 6449933 <i>Some of the explosions in them are</i>
6450016 6451852 <i>looking nowadays<br />a little bit out of scale.</i>
6451935 6454229 <i>But at the time<br />there was no other way we could do it,</i>
6454312 6457274 <i>or no time or no money<br />to do anything on a bigger scale.</i>
6470745 6473832 <i>It all somehow magically happens.</i>
6473915 6479130 <i>With a lot of struggling and planning<br />and some sort of magic power...</i>
6479213 6482175 <i>that people turn on themselves<br />or something near the end,</i>
6482258 6484594 <i>the work in the last two months</i>
6484677 6487054 <i>really can happen<br />at an incredible speed,</i>
6487138 6490099 <i>and the quality can be really great also.</i>
6490183 6494353 <i>It all did come together, and the show<br />got done on time and in the theaters.</i>
6497148 6499859 BURTT: <i>Of course, there were many<br />new ships that needed sounds.</i>
6499942 6503197 <i>The Y-wing fighters<br />have a kind of howling sound</i>
6503280 6506366 <i>as you are flying<br />in the cockpit with them.</i>
6509912 6513373 <i>That howling is actually wind<br />recorded atop a mountain.</i>
6513457 6516251 <i>When I was up trying to record<br />guy wires for lasers,</i>
6516335 6519338 <i>the wind was blowing so hard<br />through one set of guy wires...</i>
6519421 6521965 <i>that it actually<br />was producing a musical note.</i>
6522049 6524301 <i>It was almost a musical chord.</i>
6524384 6526637 <i>It was used principally<br />for the background sounds</i>
6526720 6529432 <i>of the pilots in the Y-wing fighters.</i>
6539192 6542362 LUCAS: <i>The thing of cleaning up<br />the film and everything-</i>
6542987 6545448 <i>you do have, with modern technology,</i>
6545531 6548201 <i>a chance to fix some of<br />the technical problems</i>
6548326 6550787 <i>that existed in some of these shots-</i>
6550870 6555124 <i>matte lines and things that<br />you couldn't deal with in the end.</i>
6555208 6560339 <i>When you're making something<br />and it's flawed, you want to fix it.</i>
6566011 6569181 <i>I don't know an artist around<br />that doesn't go back</i>
6569265 6571976 <i>and touch their work up years later...</i>
6572059 6574144 <i>if they have the opportunity-<br />especially painters.</i>
6574228 6576897 <i>And, of course, theater is that way.</i>
6576981 6579608 <i>Most people go back<br />and either rewrite stuff</i>
6579692 6582444 <i>or repaint stuff or fix it a little bit.</i>
6582528 6583655 <i>The issues are ultimately,</i>
6584114 6586783 <i>in terms of society,</i>
6586866 6590954 <i>whether it's okay for other people to go<br />in and start changing things...</i>
6591037 6593415 <i>and still put that artist's name on it.</i>
6593498 6595292 <i>You know, say it's a George Lucas film</i>
6595375 6597144 <i>when somebody else<br />has gone in and recut it...</i>
6597168 6599296 <i>and changed it<br />and put different music on it.</i>
6599963 6603925 <i>That's a big issue now.</i>
6604009 6606428 <i>Personally I think that as long as<br />the artist can</i>
6606511 6608930 <i>continue to have the enthusiasm<br />to refine the work,</i>
6609014 6610975 <i>they should do it.</i>
6611058 6613311 <i>But I don't think<br />that studios or other people...</i>
6613394 6615372 <i>should be allowed<br />to go and tamper with something...</i>
6615396 6617315 <i>just 'cause they want to<br />put it on television...</i>
6617398 6619598 <i>or they want to take it<br />from black and white to color...</i>
6619859 6621939 <i>or they want to have<br />a more contemporary score on it.</i>
6626324 6628409 MUREN:<br /><i>This trench was probably about</i>
6628492 6629928 <i>three feet tall and about two feet wide,</i>
6629952 6635291 <i>and the Dykstraflex camera we had<br />could just barely go between the walls,</i>
6635374 6638086 <i>but it cranked away at about<br />one frame of film a second.</i>
6638170 6641590 <i>So at 24 frames a second it would<br />look like it's going very, very fast,</i>
6641882 6643592 <i>even though it was only<br />moving probably</i>
6643675 6645510 <i>about a foot a second down the track.</i>
6645594 6647929 <i>The track we were shooting on<br />was 40 feet,</i>
6648013 6651016 <i>and I believe we had about<br />40 or 50 feet of trench made,</i>
6651099 6654269 <i>and at the end of it, we had<br />a photograph of that same trench...</i>
6654353 6656480 <i>that was shot from the outside of it...</i>
6656563 6658482 <i>that we blew up<br />and put down at the end</i>
6658565 6660525 <i>so it looked like it went on farther,</i>
6660609 6662986 <i>but you're just seeing<br />a photograph at the end.</i>
6663403 6665907 <i>We originally tried doing it<br />with a mirror down there,</i>
6665990 6668010 <i>but it revealed the camera<br />and all sorts of other things,</i>
6668034 6670286 <i>so we had to go with a photo.</i>
6694686 6699566 <i>This is one of my favorite shots here-<br />the three ships going in to a pattern.</i>
6699650 6701777 <i>That's actually the original scene</i>
6701860 6703580 <i>from the original film,<br />has not been redone.</i>
6704488 6707449 <i>That was just a really nice animatic<br />that George had for that shot.</i>
6707533 6711286 <i>I think I got all those elements in<br />one night, which was quite a night.</i>
6717709 6720672 <i>There are so many tricks going on<br />to be able to get these shots to work.</i>
6720964 6724467 <i>You can see sometimes<br />the perspectives aren't quite lining up.</i>
6724551 6727512 <i>Ships are coming<br />a little bit too low or too high,</i>
6727595 6731558 <i>but it really adds a lot<br />to the reality of the sequence.</i>
6731641 6733685 <i>It's sort of a chaotic look to it...</i>
6733977 6736396 <i>that you wouldn't get if you planned<br />everything out too much.</i>
6736479 6739482 <i>That's something George had<br />talked to us about intentionally.</i>
6739566 6741985 <i>My background on it<br />was to really figure things out,</i>
6742068 6747032 <i>and he said, "No, just do what you can,<br />and we'll piece it together later on."</i>
6747116 6749261 <i>That was absolutely the right approach,<br />and that's the approach</i>
6749285 6750995 <i>that I've certainly taken since-</i>
6751078 6752663 <i>I learned from him-is not to-</i>
6752746 6757418 <i>not to get too worried<br />and stop progress...</i>
6757501 6759295 <i>in trying to figure things out in advance.</i>
6759962 6762965 <i>Get in and sort of put it together.<br />Work on it a little bit.</i>
6763048 6765301 <i>If you like it, trust your instincts,<br />move ahead,</i>
6765384 6768053 <i>shoot the next part, same thing,<br />shoot the next part.</i>
6768137 6770806 <i>You end up with something that looks</i>
6770890 6774311 <i>a lot more natural<br />and organic and grown...</i>
6774394 6777439 <i>than something that's preplanned...</i>
6777522 6781109 <i>because a lot of this stuff<br />is just too complicated to figure out.</i>
6781193 6783445 <i>For example,<br />the background star fields-</i>
6783528 6787491 <i>we didn't analyze how fast the stars<br />should be going by in the background.</i>
6787574 6789493 <i>We shot a number of them<br />just whipping by</i>
6789576 6791995 <i>at three or four different speeds,</i>
6792078 6795081 <i>and then we would combine it<br />with the foreground...</i>
6795165 6797667 <i>and just pick the speed<br />that looked best for that moment...</i>
6797751 6801631 <i>and looked best in telling the story.</i>
6806719 6811682 <i>So, what you end up with then<br />is a chance to cheat reality,</i>
6811766 6814977 <i>and this whole film,<br />this whole battle sequence,</i>
6815061 6816771 <i>is a cheat on reality.</i>
6817063 6822693 <i>These ships that appear to be peeling<br />off and diving down and doing things,</i>
6822777 6826489 <i>if you actually had three ships up there<br />doing that for real,</i>
6826572 6829284 <i>they would really have to be<br />much farther apart from each other,</i>
6829368 6831662 <i>and the shot would not be<br />nearly as dramatic</i>
6831745 6834456 <i>as it is when you<br />put these shots together.</i>
6834540 6837709 LUCAS:<br /><i>These shots of the cannons...</i>
6837793 6841088 <i>shooting at the ships in the Death Star-<br />that was one of the first shots.</i>
6841171 6843799 <i>That was</i> the <i>first shot<br />that came out of ILM.</i>
6846593 6853350 <i>There was a drama here when<br />I came back from shooting in August.</i>
6853433 6856354 <i>And they showed me<br />about seven shots,</i>
6856437 6859190 <i>and I only approved that one shot,</i>
6859274 6862235 <i>'cause the others were not very good.</i>
6862318 6864737 <i>I sent them back<br />to do it all over again.</i>
6866197 6870285 <i>So, ultimately, it wasn't very happy,</i>
6870368 6872328 <i>especially when we had<br />about 400 shots to do...</i>
6872412 6874706 <i>and only about<br />three or four months to do them in.</i>
6875790 6879377 <i>Nobody had ever done<br />more than 50 shots in a movie.</i>
6880545 6884341 <i>In terms of movies, they'd never had<br />more than 50 special effects shots.</i>
6884967 6886635 <i>We were trying to do something</i>
6886719 6888387 <i>that would normally<br />take five years to do,</i>
6888470 6890723 <i>and we were trying to do it<br />in a few months.</i>
6900899 6903777 MUREN: <i>What we've got here<br />is some sort of animated film</i>
6903861 6905738 <i>that's done with models,</i>
6905821 6908616 <i>and the designs<br />are not so much from reality.</i>
6908699 6911411 <i>The designs are from George and us...</i>
6911494 6914539 <i>that are contributing<br />our sort of aesthetics to it,</i>
6914623 6917792 <i>to try to make it look exciting<br />and really neat to look at.</i>
6924883 6927427 LUCAS: <i>When you're interacting<br />with a real world-</i>
6927510 6929304 <i>Even though everything is fake,</i>
6929387 6932807 <i>still the technology is the real world<br />that you're interacting with.</i>
6932891 6934851 <i>When it says you can't go there,</i>
6934976 6937104 <i>you have to figure out<br />another way to get there,</i>
6937188 6939357 <i>because the story point is to get there.</i>
6939774 6942860 <i>The problem you have<br />is how do we accomplish that?</i>
6946447 6948699 MUREN: <i>It was difficult<br />with R2-D2 on the back</i>
6948783 6950284 <i>of the X-wing through<br />all the shows,</i>
6950368 6951911 <i>'cause R2 is blue,</i>
6952203 6954413 <i>and shooting against a blue screen,</i>
6954497 6957166 <i>which we had to do on<br />those cockpit shots...</i>
6957249 6959585 <i>meant that the blue sort of disappears.</i>
6959669 6963172 <i>If you look at R2<br />when he's going through the trench,</i>
6963255 6965509 <i>his blue color is gone.</i>
6966843 6969054 <i>In the background though,<br />when you see him behind Luke,</i>
6969137 6970597 <i>the blue color is back.</i>
6971598 6973183 <i>That's something we could do later on,</i>
6973266 6975066 <i>but we couldn't do it<br />when we did these films-</i>
6975227 6976937 <i>shooting blue in front of blue.</i>
6978480 6981191 HIRSCH: <i>I remember the last change<br />we made in the film.</i>
6981274 6983360 <i>It was quite late in the whole process.</i>
6983443 6984903 <i>George came in and said,</i>
6984986 6986673 <i>"I want to add a couple of shots<br />to the final reel."</i>
6986697 6989324 <i>I said, "What's that?"<br />He said, "I want Vader to get away."</i>
6989408 6992662 <i>So, there were shots<br />inside Vader's cockpit...</i>
6992745 6996624 <i>that were done with a camera<br />mounted on a circular track.</i>
6996708 7000670 <i>The film shot from this camera<br />would show Vader sitting in the seat,</i>
7000753 7003297 <i>and Vader's image would spin.</i>
7003381 7006592 <i>So we found a piece of the shot<br />where Vader was spinning,</i>
7006676 7011264 <i>'cause they had shot the spinning thing<br />for when his ship went out of control.</i>
7011347 7013891 <i>They wanted to show<br />that he had lost control of the ship,</i>
7013975 7015768 <i>and they spun<br />the camera around him.</i>
7015852 7017854 <i>We found the daily,<br />and we looked at it,</i>
7017938 7021024 <i>and there was a part<br />where the camera started into motion.</i>
7021316 7025612 <i>It started out head-on on Vader<br />and then started to spin.</i>
7026280 7029491 <i>We took the film, we ran it backwards<br />so that the ship seemed to settle.</i>
7029575 7032369 <i>He seemed to be able<br />to get control of the ship.</i>
7032453 7039418 <i>Then we cut to an exterior shot<br />that they hadn't shot anything for.</i>
7039501 7043380 <i>So we took one of the elements<br />of an earlier shot...</i>
7043464 7045633 <i>of Vader's ship,<br />accompanied by his two wingmen.</i>
7045717 7047594 <i>We eliminated the wingmen.</i>
7047677 7050805 <i>We changed the background<br />to just be a star field,</i>
7050889 7055018 <i>and we created this moment where,<br />after the explosion of the Death Star,</i>
7055310 7059397 <i>Vader gets control of the ship<br />and sails off into space.</i>
7059481 7061274 <i>I said to George,</i>
7061357 7063443 <i>"Doesn't this smack<br />too much of a sequel?</i>
7063526 7065945 <i>Isn't this kind of"-</i>
7066029 7068364 <i>Today you'd say cheesy.<br />I forget what word I used.</i>
7068823 7071201 <i>"This looks like<br />you're setting up a sequel."</i>
7071284 7074038 <i>He said, "I don't care. I'm doing it."</i>
7074663 7078501 <i>So I think George<br />had a sense at that point that...</i>
7078959 7081796 <i>there might be more films in the offing.</i>
7085633 7087819 BURTT: <i>The first film was like<br />going to the amusement park</i>
7087843 7089303 <i>for the first time for many people.</i>
7089386 7092681 <i>It was full of so many surprises.<br />That was part of the success of it.</i>
7092765 7095434 <i>It surprised you at every level,</i>
7095518 7100524 <i>and it awakened the producers of films<br />and the public...</i>
7100607 7105320 <i>as to the value that a stereo,<br />high-quality soundtrack could have...</i>
7105403 7107864 <i>on the impact of a motion picture.</i>
7107948 7109407 <i>And it set in motion...</i>
7109908 7112744 <i>a chain of events<br />which led to...</i>
7112828 7115330 <i>a real upgrading<br />of theater systems around the country...</i>
7115413 7117999 <i>and higher expectations<br />on the part of the audience...</i>
7118083 7120627 <i>as to what they would hear<br />when they go into a film.</i>
7121670 7125841 Star Wars <i>kind of opened up<br />that world creatively for us.</i>
7125924 7129136 <i>We stumbled into it at the time.</i>
7129387 7133099 <i>It was the vision of Gary Kurtz<br />and George Lucas,</i>
7133349 7135518 <i>who wanted to give<br />the film a grand scale.</i>
7135601 7141566 <i>They're the ones that were champions<br />of the cause to do the film in stereo...</i>
7141649 7145987 <i>and release it that way as widely<br />as they could across the country,</i>
7146070 7150408 <i>and it really opened the door creatively<br />for many films to follow.</i>
7152994 7154705 MUREN:<br /><i>When I first saw the film,</i>
7154788 7157100 <i>I sort of couldn't connect with it<br />because I knew it too well.</i>
7157124 7160502 <i>I knew every little flaw, but the audience<br />around me was going crazy.</i>
7160586 7162963 <i>They really, really were<br />just amazed by it.</i>
7163046 7165507 <i>And I came out afterwards,<br />and we were talking about it,</i>
7165591 7168552 <i>and people were saying "This is<br />gonna be the biggest thing of all time."</i>
7168635 7171096 <i>As we were doing it,<br />some people thought so,</i>
7171179 7174850 <i>but mainly there was one guy there<br />who was a driver working for us-</i>
7174933 7175934 <i>a young guy-</i>
7176018 7177370 <i>and he was going around<br />saying all the time,</i>
7177394 7178454 <i>"This is gonna be a huge hit.</i>
7178478 7180439 <i>This is gonna be<br />the most amazing film ever."</i>
7180522 7182233 <i>He was absolutely right. He saw it.</i>
7182317 7183997 <i>And from that initial screening<br />that I saw-</i>
7184068 7186905 <i>Apparently this happened everywhere,<br />when they had early screenings-</i>
7186988 7188948 <i>the people were going crazy.</i>
7189032 7192118 MAYHEW:<br /><i>Poor old Chewie don't get nothing.</i>
7192201 7197707 <i>But thinking about it<br />and looking at it over the years,</i>
7197790 7202086 <i>Chewie does get<br />the final line in the movie,</i>
7202170 7205548 <i>because just before<br />the credits come up,</i>
7206007 7208928 <i>there is a big Wookiee growl.</i>
7209011 7212097 <i>You've gotta listen for it, but it's there.</i>
7212181 7215059 Argh!
7217645 7220940 KURTZ: <i>The credit issue was<br />I suppose a big one in the '70s,</i>
7221023 7224693 <i>where most of the credits for films<br />were at the beginning.</i>
7225069 7231951 <i>All of the labor union contracts<br />required that for the big roles.</i>
7233160 7236623 <i>We felt that it was best<br />in this kind of story,</i>
7236706 7239876 <i>if we were going to have the roller<br />that we had indicating the story,</i>
7239960 7243004 <i>that we wanted just to have<br />the title and the roller...</i>
7243088 7245090 <i>and get into the story<br />as quickly as possible...</i>
7245173 7249052 <i>so that we didn't have to build<br />a musical sequence for the credits...</i>
7249135 7252597 <i>or worry about a credit sequence.</i>
7252681 7257602 <i>Some films can do it really effectively,<br />like they did with the</i> Pink Panther <i>films,</i>
7257686 7259604 <i>where you have an animated sequence,</i>
7259688 7262274 <i>and you make another mini movie<br />out of the credit sequence.</i>
7262525 7265152 <i>You can do very well with that,<br />but we didn't want to do that.</i>
7265236 7266821 <i>We felt the end was the best.</i>
7266904 7272535 <i>So we had to negotiate with everybody<br />whether or not that was okay.</i>
7272618 7274161 <i>Of course, the other big thing...</i>
7274245 7276497 <i>was whether or not<br />we could actually credit</i>
7276580 7278499 <i>the people that we wanted to credit,</i>
7278582 7282128 <i>because up till that time, Fox's rule,<br />and most of the other major studios,</i>
7282211 7285131 <i>was that only<br />heads of departments got credit,</i>
7285715 7287901 <i>which limited the amount of credits<br />that you could give,</i>
7287925 7290178 <i>and the rest of the people<br />didn't get any credit.</i>
7290262 7294850 <i>My attitude was,<br />"You're talking about a roll at the end.</i>"
7295600 7299062 <i>Why not allow us to<br />put these other names on there?</i>
7299146 7302649 <i>Everybody contributed really a lot<br />of effort to this,</i>
7302816 7304484 <i>"and we'd like to credit them."</i>
7304568 7309281 <i>So we ended up with I think a four-<br />and-a-half-minute end credit roller,</i>
7309531 7312701 <i>which the studio was aghast at.</i>
7312784 7315287 <i>They said,<br />"We've never done this before."</i>
7315996 7318791 <i>We had to get special<br />dispensation to do it.</i>
7319584 7323838 <i>Now the credits run to 10, 12 minutes.</i>
7323921 7328551 <i>I'm afraid I have to accept the<br />responsibility for starting that trend.</i>
7328634 7330887 <i>But putting them at the end anyway</i>
7330970 7332890 <i>I think is a really good idea<br />for a lot of films,</i>
7332972 7336726 <i>because it allows you to get right into<br />what's going on...</i>
7336809 7339312 <i>and not have to worry about<br />a credit sequence.</i>
7342315 7346820 FISHER: <i>There was this<br />sort of weird electric kind of reaction.</i>
7346904 7348822 <i>I didn't quite know what to think.</i>
7348906 7350991 <i>One had never seen anything like it...</i>
7351075 7355204 <i>in terms of the spacecraft thing going-</i>
7357081 7363003 <i>And it wasn't-You know, I had never<br />had any kind of urgency:</i>
7363087 7366757 <i>"We need more films<br />where there's a spacecraft going"-</i>
7366840 7369301 [CHUCKLES] <i>You know,<br />that had never been my thing, but-</i>
7370845 7376768 <i>I knew there was this odd<br />kind of big reaction to it, and...</i>
7376851 7381397 <i>it was a little bit baffling.</i>
7383900 7387278 LUCAS: <i>The entire film was shot<br />in I think about 70 days.</i>
7388696 7391991 <i>To do a film this complex in 70 days...</i>
7392075 7395036 <i>is sort of like doing</i><br />American Graffiti <i>in 30.</i>
7396246 7399250 <i>You know, it's just you don't have really<br />much time to do anything.</i>
7400042 7402229 Star Wars <i>is one of those things that<br />happens to you in life</i>
7402253 7404130 <i>that you don't expect.</i>
7405005 7407258 <i>But it ended up taking over my life.</i>
7407341 7411220 <i>And I ended up spending<br />the next 30 years making these films.</i>
7411303 7413639 <i>I mean, I love the films,</i>
7413722 7416308 <i>but it's quite a bit of commitment<br />to your life, I'll tell you,</i>
7416392 7418644 <i>when you get down to<br />the day-to-day struggle.</i>
7418727 7421772 HAMILL: <i>I had a friend that was<br />working at the L.A. Art Museum.</i>
7421856 7424191 <i>"I said," Look up the grosses...</i>
7424275 7427737 <i>of all the most successful fantasy<br />and science fiction films</i>
7427821 7430323 <i>"of the last 20 years or so."</i>
7430407 7433368 <i>I remember my assessment was-</i>
7433994 7438081 <i>'Cause there was a contingency plan<br />that if the first one were successful...</i>
7438165 7440167 <i>that we would do a second and a third.</i>
7441418 7444963 <i>I said, "This is gonna be easily<br />as popular as</i> Planet of the Apes."
7445046 7446965 <i>That's what I thought.</i>
7447048 7449968 <i>So I thought it was, you know,<br />a real winner.</i>
7450051 7455474 <i>I didn't really think in terms of budget<br />and how much it had to gross.</i>
7455725 7457476 <i>That wasn't my main interest.</i>
7457727 7459687 <i>It was just the quality of it,</i>
7459770 7464358 <i>and if they pull it off,<br />it could develop a real cult following.</i>
7464442 7466277 [CHUCKLES]<br /><i>Little did I know.</i>
