167834 169634 Did you hear that?
169900 173101 They shut down the main reactor.<br />We’ll be destroyed for sure.
173201 175001 This is madness.
184717 186517 We’re doomed.
188100 191100 There’ll be no escape<br />for the princess this time.
193626 195726 What’s that?
297500 300000 R2-D2, where are you?
316615 318818 At last! Where have you been?
318918 321820 They’re heading in this direction.<br />What are we going to do?
321920 326421 We’ll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel,<br />or smashed into who knows what!
326759 329259 Wait a minute.<br />Where are you going?
341674 344700 The Death Star plans<br />are not in the main computer.
344977 347713 Where are those transmissions<br />you intercepted?
347813 353019 - What have you done with those plans?<br />- We intercepted no transmissions.
353119 357090 This is a consular ship.<br />We’re on a diplomatic mission.
357190 361789 If this is a consular ship,<br />where is the ambassador?
365231 369132 Commander, tear this ship apart<br />until you’ve found those plans...
369232 372232 and bring me the passengers!<br />I want them alive!
384517 386517 There’s one. Set for stun.
391857 395000 She’ll be all right.<br />Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
397060 399560 Hey! You’re not permitted in there.<br />It’s restricted.
399762 402262 You’ll be deactivated for sure.
403336 406738 Don’t you call me a mindless philosopher,<br />you overweight glob of grease!
406838 408938 Now come out before somebody sees you.
410076 415677 “Secret mission”? What plans? What are you<br />talking about? I’m not getting in there.
418383 420383 I’m going to regret this.
427326 429427 - There goes another one.<br />- Hold your fire.
429527 432465 There’s no life forms.<br />It must have short-circuited.
432565 436065 That’s funny. The damage<br />doesn’t look as bad from out here.
438100 440300 Are you sure this thing is safe?
441007 442507 Oh.
459224 461825 Darth Vader.<br />Only you could be so bold.
461925 463651 The Imperial Senate<br />will not sit still for this.
463675 465436 When they hear you’ve<br />attacked a diplomatic -
465465 469666 Don’t act so surprised, Your Highness.<br />You weren’t on any mercy mission this time.
469967 473740 Several transmissions were<br />beamed to this ship by rebel spies.
473840 476709 I want to know what happened<br />to the plans they sent you.
476809 478610 I don’t know what you’re talking about.
478710 481914 I’m a member of the Imperial Senate<br />on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.
482014 484884 You are part of the Rebel Alliance<br />and a traitor.
484984 486984 Take her away!
491223 493524 Holding her is dangerous.<br />If word of this gets out...
493624 496227 it could generate sympathy<br />for the rebellion in the Senate.
496595 498450 I’ve traced the rebel spies to her.
498474 501728 Now she is my only link<br />to finding their secret base.
501801 503692 She’ll die before<br />she’ll tell you anything.
503716 504716 Leave that to me.
505402 509409 Send a distress signal and then inform<br />the Senate that all aboard were killed.
509509 512801 Lord Vader, the battle station plans<br />are not aboard this ship...
512901 514707 and no transmissions were made.
514807 518308 An escape pod was jettisoned during the<br />fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
518408 520849 She must have hidden the plans<br />in the escape pod.
520949 524791 Send a detachment down to retrieve them.<br />See to it personally, Commander.
524891 528600 - There’ll be no one to stop us this time.<br />- Yes, sir.
543200 545277 How did we get into this mess?
545377 547741 I really don’t know how.
548413 551313 We seem to be made to suffer.<br />It’s our lot in life.
554452 557852 I’ve got to rest before I fall apart.<br />My joints are almost frozen.
565163 567663 What a desolate place this is!
571600 573339 Where do you think you’re going?
573439 575440 Well, I’m not going that way.
575540 578540 It’s much too rocky.<br />This way is much easier.
579477 582477 What makes you think<br />there are settlements over there?
584078 585978 Don’t get technical with me.
586979 588884 What mission? What are you talking about?
591456 593756 I’ve just about had enough of you.
594026 598597 Go that way. You’ll be malfunctioning<br />within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile.
599298 603100 And don’t let me catch you following me<br />begging for help, because you won’t get it.
617230 620230 No more adventures.<br />I’m not going that way.
655000 658701 That malfunctioning little twerp.<br />This is all his fault.
658801 662702 He tricked me into going this way,<br />but he’ll do no better.
666765 671203 Wait! What’s that?<br />A transport! I’m saved!
671303 674803 Over here!<br />Hey! Hey!
676075 679602 Help! Please help!
889854 891354 R2?
894392 897592 R2-D2, it is you! It is you!
915814 919814 Someone was in the pod.<br />The tracks go off in this direction.
920019 921987 Look, sir. Droids.
933666 935666 Wake up! Wake up!
942373 944373 We’re doomed.
952383 955083 Do you think they’ll melt us down?
966999 968999 Don’t shoot!<br />Don’t shoot!
969568 971568 Will this never end?
1011400 1013045 All right, fine. Let’s go.
1013145 1015306 Luke! Luke!
1018950 1023650 Luke, tell Uncle if he gets a translator,<br />be sure it speaks Bocce.
1023922 1027322 Doesn’t look like we have much<br />of a choice, but I’ll remind him.
1037768 1040768 Yeah, we’ll take that red one.<br />No, not that one.
1044009 1046709 You, I suppose you’re programmed<br />for etiquette and protocol.
1046810 1050549 Protocol? Why, it’s my primary function,<br />sir. I am well-versed in all the customs-
1050649 1053551 - I have no need for a protocol droid.<br />- Of course you haven’t, sir.
1053651 1056555 Not in an environment such as this.<br />That is why I have been programmed-
1056655 1058894 What I really need is a<br />droid who understands
1058918 1061857 the binary language<br />of moisture vaporators.
1062056 1064403 Vaporators? Sir, my first job<br />was programming binary load lifters...
1064427 1067028 very similar to your vaporators<br />in most respects.
1067128 1068976 - Can you speak Bocce?<br />- Of course I can, sir. It’s like
1069000 1071167 - a second language to me. I’m as fluent-<br />- Yeah, all right. Shut up.
1071191 1073100 I’ll take this one. Luke!
1076000 1079187 Take these two over to the garage, will<br />you? I want them cleaned up before dinner.
1079211 1081723 But I was going into Tosche Station<br />to pick up some power converters.
1081747 1084648 You can waste time with your friends<br />when your chores are done.
1084748 1089180 - Now come on. Get to it.<br />- All right. Come on.
1091890 1093949 And the red one. Come on.
1095194 1097662 Well, come on, red. Let’s go.
1116680 1118580 - Uncle Owen!<br />- Yeah?
1118717 1121481 This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.
1121853 1124199 Hey, what are you trying to push on us?
1127291 1131523 Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit<br />is in prime condition, a real bargain.
1132097 1134499 Uncle Owen, what about that one?
1134599 1137902 What about that blue one?<br />We’ll take that one.
1138303 1139232 Yeah, take this away.
1139256 1141305 You’ll be very pleased<br />with that one, sir.
1141405 1144305 He really is in first-class condition.<br />I’ve worked with him before.
1144405 1146205 Here he comes.
1149247 1151149 Okay, let’s go.
1151249 1153962 Now, don’t you forget this.<br />Why I should stick my neck out for you...
1153986 1155986 is quite beyond my capacity.
1162427 1166129 Thank the maker!<br />This oil bath is going to feel so good.
1167330 1170600 I’ve got such a bad case<br />of dust contamination, I can barely move.
1170802 1175841 It just isn’t fair. Oh, Biggs is right.<br />I’m never gonna get out of here.
1175941 1180142 - Is there anything I might do to help?<br />- No. Not unless you can alter time,
1180242 1183242 speed up the harvest,<br />or teleport me off this rock.
1183448 1184533 I don’t think so, sir.
1184557 1187686 I’m only a droid, and not very<br />knowledgeable about such things.
1187786 1189419 Not on this planet, anyway.
1189443 1193025 As a matter of fact, I’m not<br />even sure which planet I’m on.
1193125 1195635 Well, if there’s a bright<br />center to the universe,
1195659 1198063 you’re on the planet<br />that it’s farthest from.
1198163 1201166 - I see, sir.<br />- You can call me Luke.
1201266 1203266 I see, Sir Luke.
1204031 1205532 Just Luke.
1205632 1211132 Oh. And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.<br />And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.
1212709 1214209 Hello.
1215379 1218699 You got a lot of carbon scoring here. Looks<br />like you boys have seen a lot of action.
1218750 1221101 With all we’ve been through,<br />sometimes I’m amazed...
1221201 1224076 we’re in as good condition as we are,<br />what with the rebellion and all.
1224100 1225900 You know of the rebellion<br />against the Empire?!
1225924 1229124 That’s how we came to be in your service,<br />if you take my meaning, sir.
1229825 1231926 - Have you been in many battles?<br />- Several, I think.
1232026 1235801 Actually, there’s not much to tell.<br />I’m not much more than an interpreter
1235901 1240169 and not very good at telling stories. Well,<br />not at making them interesting, anyway.
1241239 1245174 Well, my little friend, you got something<br />jammed in here real good.
1245444 1247244 Were you on a Starcruiser or-
1247545 1250748 <i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br />You’re my only hope.</i>
1250849 1252449 What’s this?
1252550 1255521 “What is what”? He asked you a question.<br />What is that?
1255621 1259316 <i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br />You’re my only hope.</i>
1263061 1266593 <i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br />You’re my only hope.</i>
1269000 1273505 Oh. He says it’s nothing, sir. Merely<br />a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.
1273605 1276008 Who is she?<br />She’s beautiful.
1276108 1279478 I’m afraid I’m not quite sure, sir.
1279578 1281980 I think she was a passenger<br />on our last voyage.
1282080 1285283 A person of some importances, I believe.<br />Our captain was attached to-
1285383 1287483 Is there any more to this recording?
1288785 1291657 Behave yourself, R2.<br />You’re going to get us into trouble.
1291757 1294799 It’s all right. You can trust him.<br />He’s our new master.
1297996 1300732 He says that he’s the property<br />of Obi-Wan Kenobi...
1300832 1304236 a resident of these parts,<br />and it’s a private message for him.
1304336 1306381 Quite frankly, sir, I don’t know what<br />he’s talking about.
1306405 1309901 Our last master was Captain Antilles.<br />But with all we’ve been through...
1310001 1312201 this little R2 unit has<br />become a bit eccentric.
1313645 1316381 Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br />I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.
1316481 1319151 I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know<br />what he’s talking about?
1319251 1323999 Well, I don’t know anyone named Obi-Wan,<br />but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.
1324800 1327000 He’s kind of a strange old hermit.
1327593 1330762 I wonder who she is.<br />Sounds like she’s in trouble.
1330862 1332862 I better play back the whole thing.
1336666 1339866 He says the restraining bolt<br />has short-circuited his recording system.
1340305 1342501 He suggests that if you remove the bolt...
1342601 1344744 he might be able to play back<br />the entire recording.
1344844 1347546 Hm? Oh, yeah. Well...
1347646 1350082 I guess you’re too small<br />to run away on me...
1350182 1352282 if I take this off. Okay...
1355420 1357220 There you go.
1358700 1361782 Wait a minute. Where’d she go? Bring<br />her back. Play back the entire message.
1362383 1365385 “What message”?<br />The one you’ve just been playing!
1365485 1367445 The one you’re carrying<br />inside your rusty innards.
1367500 1369626 Luke! Luke!
1370101 1372106 All right, I’ll be right<br />there, Aunt Beru.
1372130 1373201 I’m sorry, sir...
1373301 1375641 but he appears to have<br />picked up a slight flutter.
1375741 1379170 Here. See what you can do with him.<br />I’ll be right back.
1381901 1384501 Just you reconsider<br />playing that message for him.
1385800 1388000 No, I don’t think he likes you at all.
1388620 1390920 No, I don’t like you, either.
1399229 1402065 You know, I think that R2 unit<br />we bought might have been stolen.
1402165 1403768 What makes you think that?
1403868 1405880 Well, I stumbled across a recording<br />while I was cleaning him.
1405904 1408873 He says he belongs to someone<br />called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1411609 1415411 I thought he might have meant old Ben.<br />Do you know what he’s talking about?
1417247 1421981 - I wonder if he’s related to Ben.<br />- That wizard’s just a crazy old man.
1422452 1426080 Tomorrow, I want you to take that R2 unit<br />to Anchorhead and have its memory erased.
1426258 1429860 That’ll be the end of it.<br />It belongs to us now.
1430161 1433201 But what if this Obi-Wan<br />comes looking for him?
1433301 1438701 He won’t. I don’t think he exists anymore.<br />He died about the same time as your father.
1439270 1442070 - He knew my father?<br />- I told you to forget it.
1443440 1446200 Your only concern is to prepare<br />those new droids for tomorrow.
1446600 1448881 In the morning, I want them<br />up there on the south ridge...
1448949 1452049 - working on those condensers.<br />- Yes, sir.
1453684 1455887 I think those new droids<br />are gonna work out fine.
1455987 1459424 In fact, I, uh, was also thinking<br />about our agreement...
1459524 1463401 about me staying on another season?
1463501 1466700 And if these new droids do work out,<br />I want to transmit my application...
1466800 1468777 - to the academy this year.<br />- You mean the next semester...
1468801 1472001 - before the harvest?<br />- Sure. There’s more than enough droids.
1472101 1475301 Harvest is when I need you the most.<br />It’s only one season more.
1476400 1478108 This year we’ll make<br />enough on the harvest
1478132 1480301 that I’ll be able to hire<br />some more hands, and then
1480401 1484882 you can go to the academy next year.<br />You must understand I need you here, Luke.
1484982 1487719 - But it’s a whole ’nother year!<br />- Look, it’s only one more season.
1487819 1490220 Yeah, that’s what you said<br />when Biggs and Tank left.
1490320 1492721 - Where are you going?<br />- Looks like I’m going nowhere.
1492821 1494501 I have to go finish cleaning those droids.
1494600 1497959 Owen, he can’t stay here forever.<br />Most of his friends have gone.
1498460 1499980 It means so much to him.
1500004 1503057 I’ll make it up to him next year.<br />I promise.
1504834 1508697 Luke’s just not a farmer, Owen.<br />He has too much of his father in him.
1509073 1511573 That’s what I’m afraid of.
1560158 1562059 What are you doing hiding back there?
1562159 1564996 It wasn’t my fault, sir.<br />Please don’t deactivate me.
1565096 1568197 I told him not to go,<br />but he’s faulty, malfunctioning.
1568297 1571801 - Kept babbling on about his mission.<br />- Oh, no.
1580144 1583045 That R2 unit has always been a problem.
1583145 1585101 These astrodroids are getting<br />quite out of hand.
1585201 1587500 Even I can’t understand<br />their logic at times.
1587600 1591313 How could I be so stupid?<br />He’s nowhere in sight. Blast it!
1591589 1593597 Pardon me, sir, but<br />couldn’t we go after him?
1593621 1597200 It’s too dangerous with all the Sand People<br />around. We’ll have to wait until morning.
1597300 1599500 Luke! I’m shutting the power down.
1599600 1603124 All right! I’ll be there in a few minutes.<br />Boy, am I gonna get it.
1604201 1606147 You know, that little droid’s gonna<br />cause me a lot of trouble.
1606171 1608571 Oh, he excels at that, sir.
1619500 1621500 Luke?<br />Luke! Luke!
1631395 1632998 Have you seen Luke this morning?
1633098 1636501 He said he had some things to do<br />before he started today, so he left early.
1636601 1638634 Did he take those two<br />new droids with him?
1638658 1640000 I think so.
1640300 1642377 Well, he better have those units<br />in the south range...
1642401 1644941 repaired by midday,<br />or there’ll be hell to pay.
1646143 1648513 Lookit, there’s a droid on the scanner.<br />Dead ahead.
1648613 1651741 It might be our little R2 unit.<br />Hit the accelerator!
1674037 1675970 Hey, whoa! Just where do<br />you think you’re going?
1677271 1679501 Master Luke is your rightful owner now.
1679601 1683101 We’ll have no more of this<br />Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.
1683300 1684959 And don’t talk to me<br />of your mission, either.
1684983 1687871 You’re fortunate he doesn’t blast<br />you into a million pieces right here!
1687895 1690046 No. It’s all right, but I<br />think we’d better go.
1692046 1693625 What’s wrong with him now?
1693725 1696525 There are several creatures<br />approaching from the southeast.
1696926 1699126 Sand People, or worse.
1700765 1703865 Come on, let’s go have a look.<br />Come on!
1706170 1708271 Well, there are two Banthas down there...
1708371 1710664 but I don’t see any...<br />Wait a second.
1711742 1714973 They’re Sand People, all right.<br />I can see one of them now.
1789553 1791353 Hello, there.
1793391 1796190 Come here, my little friend.<br />Don’t be afraid.
1798729 1801029 Oh, don’t worry.<br />He’ll be all right.
1806938 1809371 Rest easy, son.<br />You’ve had a busy day.
1809940 1813171 You’re fortunate to be all in one piece.
1816547 1818605 Ben?<br />Ben Kenobi?
1819183 1821185 Boy, am I glad to see you.
1821285 1824285 The Jundland Wastes<br />are not to be traveled lightly.
1827200 1831100 Tell me, young Luke,<br />what brings you out this far?
1831801 1833901 This little droid.
1834933 1836575 I think he’s searching<br />for his former master,
1836599 1840001 but I’ve never seen such<br />devotion in a droid before.
1841000 1843767 He claims to be the property<br />of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1844142 1847577 Is he a relative of yours?<br />Do you know who he’s talking about?
1848245 1852145 Obi-Wan Kenobi?<br />Obi-Wan.
1854751 1858645 Now, that’s a name<br />I’ve not heard in a long time.
1859323 1861223 A long time.
1862226 1865219 I think my uncle knows him.<br />He said he was dead.
1865596 1868392 Oh, he’s not dead.<br />Not yet.
1868966 1872936 - You know him?<br />- Well, of course I know him. He’s me.
1875973 1878877 I haven’t gone by the name of Obi-Wan...
1878977 1881445 since, oh, before you were born.
1881812 1883614 Well, then the droid does belong to you.
1883714 1886110 I don’t seem to remember<br />ever owning a droid.
1888519 1890619 Very interesting.
1891700 1896961 I think we’d better get indoors.<br />The Sand People are easily startled...
1897061 1899662 but they’ll soon be back,<br />and in greater numbers.
1902467 1904467 3PO.
1913511 1916211 Where am I?<br />I must have taken a bad step.
1917915 1920794 Can you stand? We’ve got to get out of here<br />before the Sand People return.
1920818 1923321 I don’t think I can make it.<br />You go on, Master Luke.
1923421 1926124 There’s no sense in you risking yourself<br />on my account.
1926224 1928324 I’m done for.
1929300 1931014 No, you’re not. What<br />kind of talk is that?
1931038 1932457 Quickly. They’re on the move.
1937935 1941472 No, my father didn’t fight in the wars.<br />He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
1941572 1943341 That’s what your uncle told you.
1943441 1946453 He didn’t hold with your father’s ideals.<br />Thought he should have stayed here...
1946477 1948342 and not gotten involved.
1949013 1953384 - You fought in the Clone Wars?<br />- Yes. I was once a Jedi knight...
1953484 1955584 the same as your father.
1957855 1959316 I wish I’d known him.
1959340 1962555 He was the best<br />starpilot in the galaxy.
1963100 1964929 And a cunning warrior.
1965029 1968594 I understand you’ve become<br />quite a good pilot yourself.
1969900 1973864 And he was a good friend.<br />Which reminds me...
1975200 1977300 I have something here for you.
1979600 1982700 Your father wanted you to have this<br />when you were old enough...
1982800 1985350 but your uncle wouldn’t allow it.
1985450 1989720 He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan<br />on some damn-fool idealistic crusade...
1989820 1991589 like your father did.
1991689 1994068 Sir, if you’ll not be needing me,<br />I’ll close down for a while.
1994092 1996092 Sure. Go ahead.
1998700 2001895 - What is it?<br />- Your father’s lightsaber.
2002666 2005236 This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.
2005336 2009240 Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.
2009340 2015245 An elegant weapon<br />for a more civilized age.
2016313 2019550 For over a thousand generations,<br />the Jedi knights were the guardians...
2019650 2022744 of peace and justice<br />in the old Republic...
2023520 2027384 before the dark times...<br />before the Empire.
2030800 2033100 How did my father die?
2034831 2037200 A young Jedi named Darth Vader...
2037401 2039964 who was a pupil of mine<br />until he turned to evil...
2040938 2044099 helped the Empire hunt down<br />and destroy the Jedi knights.
2045943 2048543 He betrayed and murdered your father.
2049879 2052479 Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
2053817 2057354 Vader was seduced<br />by the dark side of the Force.
2058322 2060022 The Force?
2060657 2063000 The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.
2063460 2066131 It’s an energy field created<br />by all living things.
2066231 2070792 It surrounds us, penetrates us,<br />it binds the galaxy together.
2078208 2081372 Now let’s see if we can’t figure out<br />what you are, my little friend...
2081646 2083880 and where you come from.
2083981 2087085 - I saw part of a message he w-<br />- I seem to have found it.
2087185 2091451 <i>General Kenobi, years ago<br />you served my father in the Clone Wars.</i>
2091922 2095092 <i>Now he begs you to help him<br />in his struggle against the Empire.</i>
2095259 2098196 <i>I regret that I am unable to present<br />my father’s request to you in person.</i>
2098296 2100064 <i>But my ship has fallen under attack...</i>
2100164 2103100 <i>and I am afraid my mission<br />to bring you to Alderaan has failed.</i>
2103200 2106104 <i>I have placed information<br />vital to the survival of the rebellion...</i>
2106204 2110004 <i>into the memory systems of this R2 unit.<br />My father will know how to retrieve it.</i>
2110574 2114437 <i>You must see this droid<br />safely delivered to him on Alderaan.</i>
2114812 2117012 <i>This is our most desperate hour.</i>
2117313 2120375 <i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br />You’re my only hope.</i>
2135499 2139431 You must learn the ways of the Force<br />if you’re to come with me to Alderaan.
2140504 2142904 Alderaan?<br />I’m not going to Alderaan.
2143073 2145509 I’ve got to get home. It’s late.<br />I’m in for it as it is.
2145609 2148009 I need your help, Luke.<br />She needs your help.
2148579 2151107 I’m getting too old for this sort of thing.
2156186 2159486 I can’t get involved.<br />I’ve got work to do.
2160157 2162222 It’s not that I like the Empire.<br />I hate it, but
2162246 2164657 there’s nothing I<br />can do about it right now.
2166196 2170400 - It’s all such a long way from here.<br />- That’s your uncle talking.
2170500 2173395 My uncle.<br />How am I ever gonna explain this?
2173971 2176171 Learn about the Force, Luke.
2182513 2185000 Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
2185182 2189109 You can get a transport there to<br />Mos Eisley or wherever you’re going.
2189886 2192713 You must do what you feel<br />is right, of course.
2200798 2204067 Until this battle station<br />is fully operational, we are vulnerable.
2204435 2208295 The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.<br />They’re more dangerous than you realize.
2208972 2213103 Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander...<br />not to this battle station.
2213477 2217315 The rebellion will continue to gain support<br />in the Imperial Senate-
2217415 2221119 The Imperial Senate will no longer<br />be of any concern to us.
2221219 2225314 I have just received word that the Emperor<br />has dissolved the council permanently.
2225689 2229627 The last remnants of the old Republic<br />have been swept away.
2229727 2231427 That’s impossible.
2231695 2234264 How will the Emperor maintain control<br />without the bureaucracy?
2234364 2238564 The regional governors now have<br />direct control over their territories.
2239336 2242697 Fear will keep the local systems in line...
2242973 2246144 - fear of this battle station.<br />- And what of the rebellion?
2246244 2249547 If the rebels have obtained a complete<br />technical readout of this station...
2249647 2253781 it is possible, however unlikely, that<br />they might find a weakness and exploit it.
2254551 2258117 The plans you refer to will<br />soon be back in our hands.
2258489 2260625 Any attack made by the rebels<br />against this station...
2260725 2264551 would be a useless gesture, no matter<br />what technical data they’ve obtained.
2264829 2268292 This station is now the ultimate power<br />in the universe.
2269066 2270966 I suggest we use it.
2271368 2274601 Don’t be too proud of this<br />technological terror you’ve constructed.
2275372 2278375 The ability to destroy a<br />planet is insignificant...
2278475 2280444 next to the power of the Force.
2280544 2284002 Don’t try to frighten us with<br />your sorcerer’s ways, Lord Vader.
2284481 2286951 Your sad devotion<br />to that ancient religion...
2287051 2289642 has not helped you conjure up<br />the stolen data tapes...
2290220 2294052 or given you clairvoyance enough<br />to find the rebels’ hidden fortr-
2300664 2302864 I find your lack of faith disturbing.
2304969 2307397 Enough of this.<br />Vader, release him.
2307671 2309371 As you wish.
2311442 2313442 This bickering is pointless.
2314711 2318182 Lord Vader will provide us with<br />the location of the rebel fortress...
2318282 2321118 by the time this station is operational.
2321218 2325121 We will then crush the rebellion<br />with one swift stroke.
2332096 2333974 It looks like the Sand People<br />did this, all right.
2333998 2335733 Look. There’s gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.
2335833 2338378 It’s just, I’ve never heard of them<br />hitting anything this big before.
2338402 2341772 They didn’t...<br />but we are meant to think they did.
2341872 2346043 These tracks are side-by-side.<br />Sand People always ride single file...
2346143 2348045 to hide their numbers.
2348145 2350881 These are the same Jawas<br />that sold us R2 and 3PO.
2350981 2355379 And these blast points,<br />too accurate for Sand People.
2355953 2359082 Only Imperial stormtroopers<br />are so precise.
2359856 2362356 But why would Imperial troops<br />want to slaughter Jawas?
2367864 2370477 If they traced the robots here, they<br />may have learned who they sold them to...
2370501 2372701 and that would lead them back... home!
2373436 2376405 Wait, Luke!<br />It’s too dangerous!
2400664 2404168 Uncle Owen!<br />Aunt Beru!
2404268 2406368 Uncle Owen!
2455218 2460520 And now, Your Highness, we will discuss<br />the location of your hidden rebel base.
2503666 2506736 There’s nothing you could<br />have done, Luke, had you been there.
2506836 2511400 You’d have been killed, too, and the droids<br />would now be in the hands of the Empire.
2513275 2515475 I want to come with you to Alderaan.
2516079 2519383 There’s nothing for me here now.<br />I want to learn the ways of the Force...
2519483 2521883 and become a Jedi like my father.
2536933 2539200 Mos Eisley spaceport.
2539469 2544436 You will never find a more<br />wretched hive of scum and villainy.
2545208 2547108 We must be cautious.
2563326 2565638 - How long have you had these droids?<br />- About three or four seasons.
2565662 2568162 They’re up for sale if you want them.
2568831 2572767 - Let me see your identification.<br />- You don’t need to see his identification.
2573836 2575544 We don’t need to<br />see his identification.
2575568 2577672 These aren’t the<br />droids you’re looking for.
2578941 2581110 These aren’t the droids we’re looking for.
2581210 2583410 He can go about his business.
2584247 2586773 - You can go about your business.<br />- Move along.
2587850 2589850 Move along.<br />Move along.
2600897 2603633 I can’t abide those Jawas.<br />Disgusting creatures!
2605001 2606901 Go on, go on.
2608338 2611508 I can’t understand how we got by<br />those troops. I thought we were dead.
2611608 2615812 The Force can have a strong influence<br />on the weak-minded.
2619600 2622628 Do you really think we’re gonna find<br />a pilot here that’ll take us to Alderaan?
2622652 2625189 Most of the best freighter pilots<br />are to be found here...
2625289 2628553 only watch your step.<br />This place can be a little rough.
2629226 2631226 I’m ready for anything.
2634831 2636731 Come along, R2.
2687216 2690421 - Hey! We don’t serve their kind here.<br />- What?
2690521 2693790 Your droids, they’ll have to wait outside.<br />We don’t want them here.
2693890 2696302 Why don’t you wait out by the speeder?<br />We don’t want any trouble.
2696326 2698226 I heartily agree with you, sir.
2707871 2709571 I’ll have one of those.
2744974 2747941 - He doesn’t like you.<br />- I’m sorry.
2749011 2751111 I don’t like you, either.
2751514 2757217 You just watch yourself. We’re wanted men.<br />I have the death sentence on 12 systems.
2757587 2759389 I’ll be careful.
2759489 2762858 - You’ll be dead!<br />- This little one’s not worth the effort.
2763200 2765400 Come, let me get you something.
2768400 2770200 No blasters! No blasters!
2792355 2794055 I’m all right.
2795700 2799753 Chewbacca here is first mate<br />on a ship that might suit us.
2804699 2806799 I don’t like the look of this.
2821551 2824851 Han Solo. I’m captain<br />of the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>.
2825122 2828522 Chewie here tells me you’re looking<br />for passage to the Alderaan system.
2828692 2831000 Yes, indeed, if it’s a fast ship.
2831194 2834670 Fast ship? You’ve never heard<br />of the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>?
2835097 2836500 Should I have?
2836600 2839463 It’s the ship that made the Kessel run<br />in less than 12 parsecs.
2841471 2845843 I’ve outrun Imperial starships.<br />Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.
2845943 2848543 I’m talking about<br />the big Corellian ships now.
2850080 2852500 She’s fast enough for you, old man.
2853200 2855500 - What’s the cargo?<br />- Only passengers...
2856051 2858811 Myself, the boy, two droids...
2859989 2862089 and no questions asked.
2863459 2865462 What is it, some kind of local trouble?
2865562 2867750 Let’s just say we’d like to avoid...
2867850 2870266 any Imperial entanglements.
2871834 2874134 Well, that’s the real trick, isn’t it?
2875104 2877604 And it’s gonna cost you something extra.
2878408 2880708 Ten thousand, all in advance.
2881845 2883745 Ten thousand?
2884480 2886980 We could almost buy our own ship for that!
2887150 2890201 - But who’s gonna fly it, kid, you?<br />- You bet I could.
2890301 2893989 I’m not such a bad pilot myself.<br />We don’t have to sit here and listen...
2894957 2897161 We can pay you two thousand now...
2897261 2900321 plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
2901397 2903097 Seventeen, huh?
2906234 2908538 Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.
2908638 2911200 We’ll leave as soon as you’re ready.<br />Docking Bay 94.
2911300 2913000 Ninety-four.
2913977 2918582 Looks like somebody’s beginning to<br />take an interest in your handiwork.
2918682 2920809 All right. We’ll check it out.
2932895 2934896 Seventeen thousand!
2934996 2937901 Those guys must really be desperate.<br />This could really save my neck.
2938001 2940671 Get back to the ship, get it ready.
2940771 2942339 You’ll have to sell your speeder.
2942439 2946012 That’s okay. I’m never coming back<br />to this planet again.
2948781 2951485 Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,<br />I was just going to see your boss.
2951585 2953485 Tell Jabba that I’ve got his money.
2967300 2969569 Yeah, but this time I’ve got the money.
2973839 2976139 I don’t have it with me. Tell Jabba-
2986201 2988512 Even I get boarded sometimes.<br />Do you think I had a choice?
2993192 2994660 Over my dead body.
3000433 3002333 Yes, I’ll bet you have.
3016015 3018015 Sorry about the mess.
3026692 3029663 Her resistance to the mind probe<br />is considerable.
3029763 3032857 It’ll be some time before we can<br />extract any information from her.
3033332 3035268 The final checkout is completed.
3035368 3038537 All systems are operational.<br />What course shall we set?
3039405 3042775 Perhaps she would respond<br />to an alternative form of persuasion.
3042875 3044277 What do you mean?
3044377 3047614 I think it is time we demonstrated<br />the full power of this station.
3047714 3050100 - Set your course for Alderaan.<br />- With pleasure.
3051250 3053250 Lock the door, R2.
3055687 3057987 Alright, check this side of the street.
3061761 3064224 The door’s locked.<br />Move on to the next one.
3071300 3074807 I would much rather have gone<br />with Master Luke than stay here with you.
3074907 3078099 I don’t know what all this trouble is<br />about, but I’m sure it must be your fault.
3078800 3081612 You watch your language.
3082815 3085652 All right. Give it to me.<br />I’ll take it.
3085752 3089356 Look at this. Ever since the XP-38<br />came out, they just aren’t in demand.
3089456 3091256 It’ll be enough.
3108575 3112075 If the ship’s as fast as he’s boasting,<br />we ought to do well.
3134800 3136402 What a piece of junk!
3136502 3138632 She’ll make .5 past light speed.
3138905 3141941 She may not look like much,<br />but she’s got it where it counts, kid.
3142041 3144744 I’ve made a lot of<br />special modifications myself.
3144844 3148937 But we’re a little rushed, so if you’ll<br />just get on board we’ll get outta here.
3154120 3156020 Hello, sir.
3164230 3166030 Which way?
3167066 3169266 All right, men, load your weapons.
3171370 3173570 Stop that ship!<br />Blast them!
3183182 3185382 Chewie, get us out of here!
3186819 3190185 Oh, my. I’d forgotten how much<br />I hate space travel.
3205572 3207006 Looks like an Imperial cruiser.
3207106 3209618 Our passengers must be hotter<br />than I thought. Try and hold ’em off.
3209642 3211735 Angle the deflector shields<br />while I make the calculations
3211759 3213643 for the jump to light speed.
3223489 3226369 Stay sharp. There’s two more coming in.<br />They’re gonna try and cut us off.
3226426 3228337 Why don’t you outrun ’em?<br />I thought you said this thing was fast!
3228361 3230972 Watch your mouth, kid, or you’re<br />gonna find yourself floating home.
3230996 3233900 We’ll be safe enough once we<br />make the jump to hyperspace.
3234000 3236200 Besides, I know a few maneuvers.<br />We’ll lose ’em.
3240673 3242133 Here’s where the fun begins.
3242233 3244313 How long before you can make<br />the jump to light speed?
3244377 3247089 It’ll take a few moments to get<br />the coordinates from the navicomputer.
3247113 3248948 Are you kidding?<br />At the rate they’re gaining?
3249048 3251818 Traveling through hyperspace<br />ain’t like dustin’ crops, boy!
3251918 3254296 Without precise calculations,<br />we’d fly right through a star...
3254320 3255864 or bounce too close to a supernova...
3255888 3258357 and that would end your trip<br />real quick, wouldn’t it?
3258457 3260758 - What’s that flashing?<br />- We’re losing a deflector shield.
3260858 3263658 Go strap yourselves in.<br />I’m gonna make the jump to light speed.
3285050 3287250 We’ve entered the Alderaan system.
3287819 3291757 Governor Tarkin. I should have expected<br />to find you holding Vader’s leash.
3292224 3295484 I recognized your foul stench<br />when I was brought on board.
3297096 3298896 Charming to the last.
3299731 3303736 You don’t know how hard I found it,<br />signing the order to terminate your life.
3303836 3307173 I’m surprised you had the courage<br />to take the responsibility yourself.
3307273 3311411 Princess Leia, before your execution,<br />I would like you to be my guest...
3311511 3315140 at a ceremony that will make<br />this battle station operational.
3315514 3318342 No star system will dare<br />oppose the Emperor now.
3318818 3321053 The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin...
3321153 3323723 the more star systems<br />will slip through your fingers.
3323823 3326815 Not after we demonstrate<br />the power of this station.
3327093 3332262 In a way, you have determined the choice<br />of the planet that will be destroyed first.
3333132 3337437 Since you are reluctant to provide us<br />with the location of the rebel base...
3337537 3340240 I have chosen to test this station’s<br />destructive power...
3340340 3343409 on your home planet of Alderaan.
3343509 3346145 No! Alderaan is peaceful.<br />We have no weapons. You can’t possibly-
3346245 3350972 You would prefer another target?<br />A military target? Then name the system.
3353085 3356286 I grow tired of asking this,<br />so it will be the last time.
3357056 3359156 Where is the rebel base?
3363162 3364962 Dantooine.
3365564 3368401 - They’re on Dantooine.<br />- There. You see, Lord Vader?
3368501 3372999 She can be reasonable. Continue with<br />the operation. You may fire when ready.
3373200 3375408 - What?<br />- You’re far too trusting.
3375508 3379512 Dantooine is too remote to make an<br />effective demonstration, but don’t worry.
3379612 3382515 We will deal with your rebel friends<br />soon enough.
3382615 3384115 No!
3385751 3387751 Commence primary ignition.
3410676 3413577 Are you all right?<br />What’s wrong?
3413946 3416249 I felt a great disturbance in the Force...
3416349 3419652 as if millions of voices<br />suddenly cried out in terror...
3419752 3424219 and were suddenly silenced.<br />I fear something terrible has happened.
3426091 3428691 You’d better get on with your exercises.
3430963 3433464 Well, you can forget your troubles<br />with those Imperial slugs.
3433564 3435764 I told you I’d outrun them.
3439205 3441298 Don’t everybody thank me at once.
3441974 3445868 Anyway, we should be at Alderaan<br />about 0200 hours.
3453352 3455183 Now be careful, R2.
3464864 3467364 He made a fair move.<br />Screaming about it can’t help you.
3467565 3469769 Let him have it. It’s not wise<br />to upset a Wookiee.
3469869 3472069 But, sir, nobody worries<br />about upsetting a droid.
3472438 3475199 That’s ’cause a droid don’t pull<br />people’s arms out of their sockets...
3475274 3478868 when they lose.<br />Wookiees are known to do that.
3481413 3483105 I see your point, sir.
3483205 3486307 I suggest a new strategy, R2.<br />Let the Wookiee win.
3505003 3508435 Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force<br />flowing through him.
3509508 3511127 You mean it<br />controls your actions?
3511151 3513511 Partially, but it also<br />obeys your commands.
3519050 3521120 Hokey religions and<br />ancient weapons are no match...
3521220 3522949 for a good blaster at your side, kid.
3524022 3526324 You don’t believe in the Force, do you?
3526424 3528705 Kid, I’ve flown from<br />one side of this galaxy to the other.
3528794 3531901 I’ve seen a lot of strange stuff,<br />but I’ve never seen anything...
3532001 3536391 to make me believe there’s one<br />all-powerful force controlling everything.
3537069 3540606 There’s no mystical<br />energy field controls my destiny.
3540706 3543901 It’s all a lot of simple<br />tricks and nonsense.
3544001 3547501 I suggest you try it again, Luke.
3547980 3550715 This time, let go your conscious self...
3552852 3554813 and act on instinct.
3556087 3558224 With the blast shield down,<br />I can’t even see.
3558324 3559925 How am I supposed to fight?
3560025 3562825 Your eyes can deceive you.<br />Don’t trust them.
3571737 3573837 Stretch out with your feelings.
3588487 3592117 - You see? You can do it.<br />- I call it luck.
3592291 3594853 In my experience,<br />there’s no such thing as luck.
3595427 3597613 Look, good against<br />remotes is one thing.
3597637 3600331 Good against the living,<br />that’s something else.
3601850 3604034 Looks like we’re coming up on Alderaan.
3606806 3609608 You know, I did feel something.<br />I could almost see the remote.
3609708 3614242 That’s good. You’ve taken<br />your first step into a larger world.
3619384 3622755 - Yes?<br />- Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.
3622855 3624757 They found the remains of a rebel base...
3624857 3627257 but they estimate that it has<br />been deserted for some time.
3627326 3630887 They are now conducting an extensive<br />search of the surrounding systems.
3631963 3633989 She lied. She lied to us!
3634566 3638966 I told you she would never<br />consciously betray the rebellion.
3639405 3641807 Terminate her... immediately.
3644610 3647510 Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.<br />Cut in the sublight engines.
3650115 3651715 What the...?
3654753 3656631 We’ve come out of hyperspace<br />into a meteor shower.
3656655 3659500 Some kind of asteroid collision.<br />It’s not on any of the charts.
3659624 3660425 What’s going on?
3660449 3662825 Our position’s correct,<br />except no Alderaan.
3663095 3665434 - What do you mean? Where is it?<br />- That’s what I’m trying to tell you, kid.
3665458 3667108 It ain’t there. It’s been<br />totally blown away.
3667132 3669835 - What? How?<br />- Destroyed by the Empire.
3669935 3672095 The entire starfleet couldn’t destroy<br />the whole planet.
3672137 3674537 It would take a thousand ships<br />with more firepower than I’ve-
3675999 3677476 There’s another ship coming in.
3677576 3680600 - Maybe they know what happened.<br />- It’s an Imperial fighter.
3682000 3684783 - It followed us!<br />- No. It’s a short-range fighter.
3684883 3687883 There aren’t any bases around here.<br />Where did it come from?
3690155 3693001 It sure is leaving in a big hurry.<br />If they identify us, we’re in big trouble.
3693025 3695126 Not if I can help it.<br />Chewie, jam its transmissions.
3695226 3697404 It would be as well to let it go.<br />It’s too far out of range.
3697428 3699228 Not for long.
3702500 3705698 A fighter that size couldn’t get<br />this deep into space on its own.
3705971 3708507 He must have gotten lost,<br />been part of a convoy or something.
3708607 3711402 Well, he ain’t gonna be around<br />long enough to tell anybody about us.
3713879 3715523 Look at him.<br />He’s heading for that small moon.
3715547 3718448 I think I can get him before<br />he gets there. He’s almost in range.
3720018 3722054 That’s no moon.
3722154 3725553 - It’s a space station.<br />- It’s too big to be a space station.
3728861 3731296 I have a very bad feeling about this.
3731396 3733165 Turn the ship around.
3733265 3737762 Yeah. I think you’re right. Full reverse!<br />Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
3742507 3744475 Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power!
3746845 3748580 Why are we still moving towards it?!
3748680 3750558 We’re caught in a tractor beam.<br />It’s pulling us in!
3750582 3753528 - There’s got to be something you can do!<br />- There’s nothing I can do about it, kid.
3753552 3755564 I’m full power. I’m<br />gonna have to shut down.
3755588 3757552 They’re not gonna<br />get me without a fight.
3761226 3764789 You can’t win, but there are<br />alternatives to fighting.
3781413 3783549 <i>Clear Bay 327.</i>
3783649 3786049 <i>We’re opening the magnetic field.</i>
3800632 3803298 To your stations!<br />Come with me.
3807206 3810831 <i>Close all outboard shields.<br />Close all outboard shields.</i>
3812577 3814680 - Yes?<br />- <i>We’ve captured a freighter...</i>
3814780 3816981 <i>entering the remains<br />of the Alderaan system.</i>
3817081 3820686 <i>Its markings match those of a ship<br />that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.</i>
3820786 3824323 They must be trying to return<br />the stolen plans to the princess.
3824423 3827392 She may yet be of some use to us.
3832364 3836057 <i>Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9.<br />Release charge.</i>
3837903 3840030 <i>316, report to control.</i>
3843675 3845376 There’s no one on board, sir.
3845476 3848476 According to the log, the crew<br />abandoned ship right after takeoff.
3848678 3851526 It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the<br />escape pods have been jettisoned.
3851550 3853485 - Did you find any droids?<br />- No, sir.
3853585 3855496 If there were any on board,<br />they must also have jettisoned.
3855520 3858957 Send a scanning crew aboard.<br />I want every part of this ship checked.
3859057 3860458 Yes, sir.
3860558 3864652 I sense something...<br />a presence I’ve not felt since...
3867299 3869135 Get me a scanning crew<br />in here on the double.
3869159 3871399 I want every part<br />of this ship checked.
3890455 3892391 Boy, it’s lucky you had these compartments.
3892491 3895690 I use them for smuggling. I never<br />thought I’d be smuggling myself in ’em.
3895961 3898497 This is ridiculous.<br />Even if I could take off...
3898597 3901466 - I’d never get past the tractor beam.<br />- Leave that to me.
3901566 3904436 Damn fool, I knew<br />that you were gonna say that.
3904536 3907996 Who’s the more foolish, the fool<br />or the fool who follows him?
3917548 3922186 The ship’s all yours. If the scanners<br />pick up anything, report it immediately.
3923054 3924754 All right, let’s go.
3939004 3940704 Hey, down there!
3942841 3944841 Could you give us a hand with this?
3953418 3956044 TK-421, why aren’t you at your post?
3956621 3958721 TK-421, do you copy?
3971102 3974502 Take over. We’ve got a bad<br />transmitter. I’ll see what I can do.
3991522 3993835 You know, between his howling<br />and your blasting everything in sight...
3993859 3996179 it’s a wonder the whole station<br />doesn’t know we’re here.
3996228 3999364 Bring ’em on! I’d prefer a straight fight<br />to all this sneakin’ around.
3999464 4001200 We’ve found the computer outlet, sir.
4001300 4004398 Plug in. He should be able to interpret<br />the entire Imperial network.
4015579 4019351 He says he’s found the main controls to the<br />power beam that’s holding the ship here.
4019451 4022046 He’ll try to make the precise location<br />appear on the monitor.
4032262 4035434 I don’t think you boys can help.<br />I must go alone.
4035534 4039004 Whatever you say. I’ve done more than<br />I bargained for on this trip already.
4039104 4040372 I want to go with you.
4040472 4042775 Be patient, Luke.<br />Stay and watch over the droids.
4042875 4045076 - But he can-<br />- They must be delivered safely...
4045176 4048179 or other star systems will suffer<br />the same fate as Alderaan.
4048279 4051975 Your destiny lies along<br />a different path from mine.
4055653 4058987 The Force will be with you...<br />always.
4068329 4073490 You said it, Chewie.<br />Where did you dig up that old fossil?
4074300 4075903 Ben is a great man.
4076003 4079043 - Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.<br />- I didn’t hear you give any ideas.
4079107 4081753 Well, anything’s better than just hangin’<br />around waiting for ’em to pick us up.
4081777 4083677 Who do you think-
4084545 4087716 - What is it?<br />- I’m afraid I’m not quite sure, sir.
4087816 4090585 He says “I’ve found her”<br />and keeps repeating “She’s here.”
4090685 4093421 Well, who... who has he found?
4093521 4095857 - Princess Leia.<br />- The princess? She’s here?!
4095957 4097788 - Princess?!<br />- Where? Where is she?
4097888 4099888 Princess?!<br />What’s going on?
4104832 4108290 Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.
4112873 4115743 I’m afraid she’s<br />scheduled to be terminated.
4115843 4118346 Oh, no! We’ve got to do something!
4118446 4120982 - What are you talking about?<br />- The droids belong to her.
4121082 4123085 She’s the one in the message.<br />We gotta help her.
4123185 4126063 Now look, don’t get any funny ideas.<br />The old man wants us to wait right here.
4126087 4129458 But he didn’t know she was here. Just<br />find a way back into that detention block.
4129558 4131994 - I’m not going anywhere.<br />- They’re going to execute her.
4132094 4134472 Look, a few minutes ago, you said<br />you didn’t want to just wait here to be captured.
4134496 4136001 Now, all you want to do is stay?
4136101 4138409 Marching into the detention area<br />is not what I had in mind.
4138433 4141962 - But they’re gonna kill her!<br />- Better her than me!
4149777 4151677 She’s rich.
4153815 4156384 - Rich?<br />- Mm-hmm. Rich, powerful.
4156484 4159554 Listen, if you were to rescue her,<br />the reward would be...
4159654 4162590 - What?<br />- Well, more wealth than you can imagine.
4162690 4165691 - I don’t know, I can imagine quite a bit.<br />- You’ll get it.
4165791 4167991 - I better.<br />- You will.
4168500 4170598 All right, kid.<br />You better be right about this.
4170698 4172499 - All right.<br />- What’s your plan?
4172599 4173970 Uh...
4174070 4176570 3PO, hand me those binders there,<br />will you?
4177939 4179941 Okay...
4180041 4182271 Now... I’m gonna put these on you.
4184101 4187415 Okay Han, you... you put those on.
4187515 4190175 Don’t worry, Chewie.<br />I think I know what he has in mind.
4190651 4192754 Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking...
4192854 4195990 but what should R2 and I do<br />if we’re discovered here?
4196090 4199557 - Lock the door.<br />- And hope they don’t have blasters.
4199657 4201657 That isn’t very reassuring.
4222016 4226016 <i>517 to scanner control.<br />517 to scanner control.</i>

4289417 4291708 I did say so before.

4309804 4312604 Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.
4314040 4317804 I wasn’t notified.<br />I’ll have to clear it.
4324418 4326587 - Look out! He’s loose!<br />- He’ll tear us all apart!
4326687 4328287 I’ll get him!
4351246 4352946 Look out!
4362590 4365059 We gotta find out which cell<br />this princess of yours is in.
4365159 4369255 Here it is... 2187. You go and get her.<br />I’ll hold them here.

4376604 4381676 Uh, had a slight weapons malfunction, but,<br />uh, everything’s perfectly all right now.
4381776 4386247 We’re fine... We’re all fine here now.<br />Thank you. How are you?
4386347 4387849 <i>We’re sending a squad up.</i>

4425086 4427321 I’m Luke Skywalker.<br />I’m here to rescue you.
4427421 4429022 - You’re who?<br />- I’m here to rescue you.
4429122 4431025 I’ve got your R2 unit.<br />I’m here with Ben Kenobi.
4431125 4433682 - Ben Kenobi?! Where is he?<br />- Come on!
4435329 4439367 - He is here.<br />- Obi-Wan Kenobi?
4439467 4442771 - What makes you think so?<br />- A tremor in the Force.
4442871 4446874 The last time I felt it was<br />in the presence of my old master.
4446974 4449443 Surely he must be dead by now.
4449543 4452413 Don’t underestimate the Force.
4452513 4456751 The Jedi are extinct.<br />Their fire has gone out of the universe.
4456851 4460288 You, my friend, are all that’s left<br />of their religion.
4460388 4461847 Yes.
4461947 4465547 <i>We have an emergency alert<br />in Detention Block AA-23.</i>
4465893 4468462 The princess?<br />Put all sections on alert.
4468562 4472166 Obi-Wan is here.<br />The Force is with him.
4472266 4474836 If you’re right, he must not be<br />allowed to escape.
4474936 4478766 Escape is not his plan.<br />I must face him alone.
4487981 4489781 Get behind me!<br />Get behind me!
4501028 4503787 Watch your left.<br />They went down the cell bay.
4506167 4507568 Can’t get out that way.
4507668 4509445 Looks like you managed to cut off<br />our only escape route.
4509469 4512669 Maybe you’d like it back in your cell,<br />Your Highness.
4514208 4516644 - C-3PO, C-3PO!<br />- <i>Yes, sir?</i>
4516744 4520244 Are there any other ways out of<br />the cell bay? We’ve been cut off!
4522850 4525086 What was that?<br />I didn’t copy.
4525186 4528522 I said all systems have been alerted<br />to your presence, sir.
4528622 4530723 The main entrance seems<br />to be the only way in or out.
4530823 4533127 All other information<br />on your level is restricted.
4533227 4535627 Open up in there! Open up in there!
4537100 4538650 Oh, no!
4538800 4540900 There isn’t any other way out!
4545907 4547976 I can’t hold them off forever!<br />Now what?!
4548076 4551813 This is some rescue! You came in here,<br />and you didn’t have a plan for getting out?
4551913 4555442 - He’s the brains, sweetheart!<br />- Well, I didn’t...
4556818 4560653 - What the hell are you doing?<br />- Somebody has to save our skins.
4562457 4565057 Into the garbage chute, flyboy.
4571632 4573432 Get in there!
4574034 4577364 Get in there, you big furry oaf!<br />I don’t care what you smell.
4577938 4580305 Get in there, and don’t worry about it.
4582943 4585043 Wonderful girl!
4586114 4589745 Either I’m going to kill her,<br />or I’m beginning to like her.
4590852 4592752 Get in there!
4605399 4608197 The garbage chute was<br />a really wonderful idea.
4608969 4611864 What an incredible smell<br />you’ve discovered!
4614442 4616277 Let’s get out of here.
4616377 4619111 - Get away from there.<br />- No, wait!
4625086 4627955 Will you forget it? I already tried it!<br />It’s magnetically sealed.
4628055 4630524 Put that thing away!<br />You’re gonna get us all killed!
4630624 4632150 Absolutely, Your Worship.
4632250 4635096 Look, I had everything under control<br />till you led us down here!
4635196 4637708 You know, it’s not gonna take ’em long<br />to figure out what happened to us!
4637732 4639732 It could be worse.
4644071 4646574 - It’s worse.<br />- There’s something alive in here.
4646674 4651409 - That’s your imagination.<br />- Something just moved past my leg.
4652680 4654680 Look! Did you see that?
4655149 4656749 What?
4676204 4679104 Kid! Luke!
4683010 4684510 Luke!
4689150 4693546 Luke! Luke, grab hold of this!
4693921 4696023 Blast it, will you?<br />My gun’s jammed.
4696123 4699182 - Where?<br />- Anywhere!
4706701 4708301 Luke, Luke!
4731392 4734128 Help him!<br />What happened?
4734228 4738161 I don’t know. It just let go of me<br />and disappeared.
4744138 4746638 I got a bad feeling about this.
4750400 4752981 The walls are moving!
4753081 4756381 Don’t just stand there!<br />Try and brace it with something.
4764092 4765992 Help me!
4778739 4780539 Wait a minute!
4782676 4786847 3PO!<br />Come in, 3PO!
4786947 4790414 <i>3PO!<br />Where could he be?</i>
4794800 4797080 Take over. See to him.
4798093 4801084 Look, there.
4802930 4804631 They’re madmen!
4804731 4807410 They’re heading for the prison level.<br />If you hurry, you might catch them.
4807434 4809234 Follow me.
4812640 4814640 You stand guard.
4819446 4821746 Come on.
4824451 4825651 Oh!
4828723 4832060 All this excitement has overrun<br />the circuits in my counterpart here.
4832160 4835227 If you don’t mind, I’d like to take him<br />down to maintenance.
4835327 4837827 All right.
4848910 4851979 3PO!<br />Come in, 3PO!
4852079 4853514 3PO!
4853614 4856083 - Get on top!<br />- I can’t!
4856183 4861480 Where could he be?! 3PO!<br />3PO, will you come in!
4861755 4864124 They aren’t here. Something<br />must have happened to them.
4864224 4866917 See if they’ve been captured.<br />Hurry!
4870664 4873499 One thing’s for sure.<br />We’re all gonna be a lot thinner.
4876036 4879036 - Get on top of it.<br />- I’m trying.
4884211 4887404 Thank goodness they haven’t found them!<br />Where could they be?
4888000 4891152 Use the comlink?
4891252 4894316 Oh, my. I forgot.<br />I turned it off.
4897990 4899427 Are you there, sir?
4899527 4900995 3PO?!
4901095 4903897 - We’ve had some problems.<br />- <i>Will you shut up and listen to me?!</i>
4903997 4906900 Shut down all the garbage mashers<br />on the detention level, will ya?!
4907000 4910000 Do you copy!? Shut down all the garbage<br />mashers on the detention level!
4911972 4914542 <i>Shut down all the garbage mashers<br />on the detention level!</i>
4914642 4917142 No! Shut them all down.<br />Hurry!
4929123 4931681 What?
4933494 4936095 Listen to them.<br />They’re dying, R2!
4936195 4941202 Curse my metal body! I wasn’t fast enough.<br />It’s all my fault! My poor master.
4941302 4946003 We’re all right! You did great! Hey!<br />Open the pressure maintenance hatch...
4946103 4950906 on unit number... where are we?<br />3263827!
4996889 4998890 If we can just avoid<br />any more female advice,
4998914 5000728 we ought to be able<br />to get outta here.
5000828 5003931 Well, let’s get moving.
5004031 5005765 Where are you going?
5006266 5008634 No, wait! They’ll hear!
5010037 5012538 Come here, you big coward.<br />Chewie, come here.
5012638 5014039 Listen...
5014139 5017003 I don’t know who you are<br />or where you came from...
5017103 5020046 but from now on, you do<br />as I tell you, okay?
5020813 5023751 Look, Your Worshipfulness,<br />let’s get one thing straight.
5023851 5026987 I take orders from just one person... me!
5027087 5029123 It’s a wonder you’re still alive.
5029223 5032393 Will somebody get this big<br />walking carpet out of my way?
5032493 5034993 No reward is worth this!
5044805 5048233 - Give me regular reports, please.<br />- Right.
5050310 5053310 - Do you know what’s going on?<br />- Maybe it’s another drill.
5058451 5060354 You seen that new VT-16?
5060454 5062623 Yeah. Some of the other guys<br />were telling me about it.
5062723 5064625 They say it’s... it’s quite a thing to see.
5064725 5067227 What was that?
5067327 5069985 Ah, it’s nothing. Outgassing.<br />Don’t worry about it.
5075335 5077738 - There she is.<br />- C-3PO? Do you copy?
5077838 5079239 <i>Yes, sir.</i>
5079339 5080901 - Are you safe?<br />- <i>For the moment.</i>
5081001 5083340 We’re in the main hangar<br />across from the ship.
5085312 5088515 - We’re right above you. Stand by.<br />- You came in that thing?!
5088615 5091314 - You’re braver than I thought!<br />- Nice! Come on.
5095489 5097184 It’s them!<br />Blast them!
5098525 5101094 - Get back to the ship!<br />- Where are you going? Come back!
5101194 5102124 He certainly has courage.
5102148 5104171 What good will it do us<br />if he gets himself killed?
5104195 5105695 Come on.
5130390 5133190 I think we took a wrong turn.
5137698 5139398 There’s no lock!
5142869 5145706 - That oughta hold them for a while.<br />- Quick! We’ve got to get across.
5145806 5149076 - Find the controls that extend the bridge.<br />- I think I just blasted it.
5149176 5151076 They’re coming through!
5172933 5174833 Here, hold this.
5191218 5192918 Here they come.
5203529 5205229 For luck.
5211003 5216003 We think they may be splitting up.<br />They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.
5230023 5232023 Where could they be?
5244700 5247002 Open the blast doors!<br />Open the blast doors!
5265559 5269919 I’ve been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.<br />We meet again at last.
5270996 5273100 The circle is now complete.
5273200 5277671 When I left you, I was but the learner.<br />Now I am the master.
5277771 5280471 Only a master of evil, Darth.
5299793 5302562 Your powers are weak, old man.
5302662 5306299 You can’t win, Darth.<br />If you strike me down...
5306399 5309800 I shall become more powerful<br />than you can possibly imagine.
5316976 5319274 You should not have come back.
5344838 5347768 Didn’t we just leave this party?
5349242 5351645 - What kept you?<br />- We, uh, ran into some old friends.
5351745 5354247 - The ship all right?<br />- It seems okay, if we can get to it.
5354347 5357147 I just hope the old man got<br />the tractor beam out of commission.
5371264 5372764 Look!
5375602 5378102 Come on, R2, we’re going.
5379039 5381039 Now’s our chance! Go!
5384277 5385777 Ben?
5400394 5401894 No!
5410504 5413504 - Come on!<br />- Come on! Come on!
5414008 5417508 - Luke, it’s too late!<br />- Blast the door, kid!
5426900 5429320 <i>Run, Luke, run!</i>
5432058 5434204 I hope that old man got that<br />tractor beam out of commission...
5434228 5437356 or this is gonna be a real short trip.<br />Okay, hit it!
5468394 5470998 We’re coming up on their sentry ships.<br />Hold them off.
5471098 5473898 Angle the deflector shields<br />while I charge up the main guns.
5482943 5485043 I can’t believe he’s gone.
5489081 5490981 There wasn’t anything<br />you could have done.
5491450 5493919 Come on, buddy.<br />We’re not out of this yet.
5510303 5513063 You in, kid?<br />Okay, stay sharp.
5523617 5525417 Here they come.
5542600 5544600 They’re coming in too fast!
5552479 5556745 - We’ve lost the lateral controls!<br />- Don’t worry. She’ll hold together.
5558251 5560251 Hear me, baby?<br />Hold together.
5581975 5586175 - Got him! I got him!<br />- Great, kid! Don’t get cocky.
5587414 5589377 There’s still two more of them out there!
5622883 5626583 - That’s it! We did it!<br />- We did it!
5626753 5629613 Help! I think I’m melting!<br />This is all your fault!
5637130 5638732 Are they away?
5638832 5641902 They’ve just made the jump<br />into hyperspace.
5642002 5646202 You’re sure the homing beacon<br />is secure aboard their ship?
5646339 5650939 I’m taking an awful risk, Vader.<br />This had better work.
5651377 5653680 Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?
5653780 5657217 You know, sometimes<br />I amaze even myself.
5657317 5659486 That doesn’t sound too hard.
5659586 5663400 They let us go. It’s the only explanation<br />for the ease of our escape.
5663500 5666159 - Easy? You call that easy?<br />- They’re tracking us.
5666259 5668327 Not this ship, sister.
5669228 5671831 At least the information in<br />R2 is still intact.
5671931 5674138 What’s so important?<br />What’s he carrying?
5674162 5676802 The technical readouts<br />of that battle station.
5677770 5680974 I only hope that when the data’s analyzed,<br />a weakness can be found.
5681074 5684244 - It’s not over yet.<br />- It is for me, sister.
5684344 5687715 Look, I ain’t in this for your revolution,<br />and I’m not in it for you, Princess.
5687815 5690750 I expect to be well paid.<br />I’m in it for the money.
5690850 5692753 You needn’t worry about your reward.
5692853 5696253 If money is all that you love,<br />then that’s what you’ll receive.
5699159 5703230 Your friend is quite a mercenary. I<br />wonder if he really cares about anything...
5703330 5705365 or anybody.
5705465 5707065 I care!
5713473 5715173 So...
5715800 5719610 - What do you think of her, Han?<br />- I’m trying not to, kid.
5720379 5721979 Good.
5725084 5728053 Still, she’s got a lot of spirit.
5729856 5732893 I don’t know. What do you think?<br />You think a princess and a guy like me-
5732993 5734793 No.
5781341 5784544 You’re safe. When we heard about Alderaan,<br />we feared the worst.
5784644 5788348 We have no time for sorrows, Commander. You<br />must use the information in this R2 unit...
5788448 5791306 to help plan the attack.<br />It’s our only hope.
5812839 5815542 - Yes.<br />- <i>We’re approaching the planet Yavin.</i>
5815642 5820571 <i>The rebel base is on a moon on the far<br />side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.</i>
5828755 5832926 The battle station is heavily shielded,<br />and carries a firepower...
5833026 5835261 greater than half the starfleet.
5835361 5839699 Its defenses are designed around<br />a direct large-scale assault.
5839799 5845101 A small, one-man fighter should be able<br />to penetrate the outer defense.
5846471 5850210 Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good<br />are snub fighters going to be against that?
5850310 5853747 Well, the Empire doesn’t consider<br />a small, one-man fighter...
5853847 5857347 to be any threat,<br />or they’d have a tighter defense.
5857751 5861020 An analysis of the plans<br />provided by Princess Leia...
5861120 5864619 has demonstrated a weakness<br />in the battle station.
5864991 5867427 The approach will not be easy.
5867527 5870697 You’re required to maneuver<br />straight down this trench...
5870797 5873597 and skim the surface to this point.
5873967 5876970 The target area is only two meters wide.
5877070 5881874 It’s a small thermal exhaust port<br />right below the main port.
5881974 5885111 The shaft leads directly<br />to the reactor system.
5885211 5890216 A precise hit will start a chain reaction,<br />which should destroy the station.
5890316 5893920 Only a precise hit will<br />set up a chain reaction.
5894020 5897190 The shaft is ray-shielded,<br />so you’ll have to use proton torpedoes.
5897290 5900359 - That’s impossible, even for a computer.<br />- It’s not impossible.
5900459 5902996 I used to bull’s-eye womp rats<br />in my T-16 back home.
5903096 5905196 They’re not much bigger than two meters.
5905598 5909334 Then man your ships,<br />and may the Force be with you.
5917043 5919834 <i>Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.</i>
5920312 5924283 <i>The moon with the rebel base<br />will be in range in 30 minutes.</i>
5924383 5928955 This will be a day long remembered.<br />It has seen the end of Kenobi...
5929055 5933555 and will soon see the end<br />of the rebellion.
5937230 5940230 <i>All flight crews, man your stations.</i>
5940900 5943900 <i>All flight crews, man your stations.</i>
5946205 5949108 So... you got your reward<br />and you’re just leaving, then?
5949208 5951008 That’s right. Yeah.
5952177 5954847 I got some old debts I got<br />to pay off with this stuff.
5954947 5956588 And even if I didn’t, you<br />don’t think I’d be fool enough
5956612 5959047 to stick around here, do you?
5959418 5963022 Why don’t you come with us? You’re<br />pretty good in a fight. We could use you.
5963122 5966025 Come on. Why don’t you<br />take a look around?
5966125 5968461 You know what’s about to happen,<br />what they’re up against.
5968561 5971764 They could use a good pilot like you.<br />You’re turning your back on them.
5971864 5974267 What good’s a reward<br />if you ain’t around to use it?
5974367 5977137 Besides, attacking that battle station<br />ain’t my idea of courage.
5977237 5980267 It’s more like... suicide.
5981707 5984611 All right.<br />Take care of yourself, Han.
5984711 5987680 I guess that’s what<br />you’re best at, isn’t it?
5987780 5989480 Hey, Luke.
5992218 5994852 May the Force be with you.
6001094 6004525 What are you looking at?<br />I know what I’m doing.
6008611 6013611 <i>All pilots to your stations.<br />All pilots to your stations.</i>
6019688 6021688 - What’s wrong?<br />- Oh, it’s Han.
6022089 6024893 I don’t know. I really thought<br />he’d change his mind.
6024994 6028796 He’s got to follow his own path.<br />No one can choose it for him.
6029464 6031964 I only wish Ben were here.
6040009 6042300 <i>Open main launch tubes.</i>
6043913 6046780 <i>Main launch tubes opening, sir.</i>
6051821 6055157 Hey, this R2 unit of yours seems a bit<br />beat up. You want a new one?
6055257 6058217 Not on your life. That little droid and I<br />have been through a lot together.
6058294 6060194 You okay, R2?
6060896 6062396 Good.
6063232 6066232 <i>Gold squadron, begin takeoff procedure.</i>
6066636 6069300 Hang on tight, R2.<br />You’ve got to come back.
6071441 6073665 You wouldn’t want my life<br />to get boring, would you?
6122291 6126291 <i>Luke, the Force will be with you.</i>

6175678 6178058 <i>We’re passing through<br />their magnetic field.</i>
6178082 6178981 Hold tight.
6179081 6182746 <i>Switch your deflectors on.<br />Double front.</i>
6185221 6188022 - Look at the size of that thing!<br />- <i>Cut the chatter, Red Two.</i>
6188122 6190217 Accelerate to attack speed.
6192995 6195732 - This is it, boys.<br />- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
6195832 6198868 - I copy, Gold Leader.<br />- We’re starting for the target shaft now.
6198968 6202864 We’re in position. I’m going to cut across<br />the axis and try and draw their fire.
6216886 6220286 <i>- Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.<br />- I see it. Stay low.</i>
6227596 6229896 This is Red Five. I’m going in.
6233702 6235602 <i>Luke, pull up!</i>
6236405 6239137 - Are you all right?<br />- I got a little cooked, but I’m okay.
6244713 6246482 We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader...
6246582 6248660 but they’re so small,<br />they’re evading our turbolasers.
6248684 6252784 We’ll have to destroy them ship to ship.<br />Get the crews to their fighters.
6255191 6256305 Watch yourself.
6256329 6259695 There’s a lot of fire coming from<br />the right side of that deflection tower.
6259795 6262532 - I’m on it.<br />- I’m going in. Cover me, Porkins.
6262632 6264932 I’m right with you, Red Three.
6270206 6272006 I’ve got a problem here.
6272200 6273801 - Eject!<br />- I can hold it.
6273901 6276301 - Pull up!<br />- No, no, I’m all-
6280216 6283216 <i>The rebel base will be in firing range<br />in seven minutes.</i>
6287022 6290222 <i>Luke, trust your feelings.</i>
6297733 6301570 Squad leaders, we’ve<br />picked up a new group of signals.
6301670 6303439 Enemy fighters coming your way.
6303539 6305307 My scope’s negative.<br />I don’t see anything.
6305407 6307864 - Pick up your visual scanning.<br />- Here they come.
6310500 6312800 Watch it. You’ve got one on your tail.
6317653 6319253 I’m hit!
6319989 6323088 - You’ve picked one up! Watch it!<br />- I can’t see it!
6324627 6326927 He’s on me tight.<br />I can’t shake him!
6328163 6330063 I’ll be right there.
6342210 6346103 Several fighters have broken off<br />from the main group. Come with me.
6349051 6351553 <i>Pull in! Luke, pull in!</i>
6351653 6355453 Watch your back, Luke. Watch your back.<br />Fighters above you, coming in.
6361030 6363732 I’m hit, but not bad.<br />R2, see what you can do with it.
6363832 6366032 Hang on back there.
6366435 6368704 <i>Red Six, can you see Red Five?</i>
6368804 6371573 <i>There’s a heavy fire zone...<br />Red Five, where are you?</i>
6371673 6373373 I can’t shake him!
6376700 6378669 I’m on him, Luke. Hold on.
6381417 6383544 Blast it, Biggs! Where are you?
6390559 6392995 - Thanks, Wedge.<br />- <i>Good shooting, Wedge.</i>
6393095 6396556 Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.<br />We’re starting our attack run.
6397967 6400767 <i>I copy, Gold Leader.<br />Move into position.</i>
6402871 6405240 Stay in attack formation.
6405340 6408441 The exhaust port is marked and locked in.
6413883 6416883 <i>Switch all power to<br />front deflector screens.</i>
6416986 6419986 <i>Switch all power to<br />front deflector screens.</i>
6424900 6426896 How many guns do you think, Gold Five?
6426996 6430032 <i>Say about 20 guns. Some on the surface,<br />some on the towers.</i>
6430132 6433132 <i>Death Star will be in<br />range in five minutes.</i>
6435170 6437370 Switch to targeting computer.
6440676 6443135 Computer locked.<br />Getting a signal.
6445147 6447638 The guns!<br />They’ve stopped!
6448800 6451501 Stabilize your rear deflectors.<br />Watch for enemy fighters.
6451601 6454418 They’re coming in!<br />Three marks at 210.
6456091 6459591 - I’ll take them myself. Cover me.<br />- Yes, sir.
6473776 6476412 - It’s no good. I can’t maneuver.<br />- Stay on target.
6476512 6478905 - We’re too close.<br />- Stay on target.
6480382 6482082 Loosen up!
6484220 6487089 Gold Five to Red Leader,<br />lost Tiree, lost Hutch.
6487189 6489946 - I copy, Gold Leader.<br />- They came from behind.
6495800 6498634 We’ve analyzed their attack, sir,<br />and there is a danger.
6498734 6500570 Should I have your ship standing by?
6500670 6506070 Evacuate? In our moment of triumph?<br />I think you overestimate their chances.
6506608 6509238 <i>Rebel base, three minutes and closing.</i>
6509711 6513315 Red boys, this is Red Leader.<br />Rendezvous at mark 6.1.
6513415 6517086 <i>- This is Red Two flying toward you.<br />- Red Three standing by.</i>
6517186 6518887 Red Leader, this is Base One.
6518987 6521391 <i>Keep half your group out of range<br />for the next run.</i>
6521491 6524160 <i>Copy, Base One. Luke,<br />take Red Two and Three.</i>
6524260 6527560 Hold up here and wait for<br />my signal to start your run.
6536404 6538204 This is it!
6541900 6544000 We should be able to see it by now.
6545500 6547978 Keep your eyes open for those fighters.
6549218 6551830 There’s too much interference. Red Five,<br />can you see them from where you are?
6551854 6555278 - No sign of any... Wait. Coming in .35.<br />- I see them.
6556292 6558092 I’m in range.
6558661 6560561 Target’s coming up.
6563065 6565400 Just hold them off for a few seconds.
6565800 6568032 Close up formation.
6569371 6571566 Almost there.
6580000 6581085 You’d better let her loose.
6581109 6583901 - They’re right behind me.<br />- Almost there.
6584700 6586600 I can’t hold them.
6594700 6596400 It’s away!
6599900 6601337 <i>- It’s a hit!<br />- Negative.</i>
6601437 6603906 Negative.<br />It didn’t go in.
6604006 6606968 <i>It just impacted on the surface.</i>
6612748 6617186 Red Leader, we’re right above you.<br />Turn to .05. We’ll cover for you.
6617286 6620586 Stay there. I just lost<br />my starboard engine.
6620989 6623453 Get set up for your attack run.
6636238 6639374 <i>Rebel base, one minute and closing.</i>
6639474 6643045 <i>Biggs, Wedge, let’s close it up.<br />We’re going in full throttle.</i>
6643145 6645099 That ought to keep<br />those fighters off our back.
6645123 6646849 Right with you, boss.
6646949 6649451 Luke, at that speed, will you be able<br />to pull out in time?
6649551 6651876 It’ll be just like Beggar’s<br />Canyon back home.
6658600 6660830 We’ll stay back far enough to cover you.
6660930 6663599 <i>My scope shows the tower,<br />but I can’t see the exhaust port.</i>
6663699 6666099 Are you sure the computer can hit it?
6668537 6670776 Watch yourself. Increase<br />speed, full throttle.
6670800 6672139 What about that tower?
6672239 6675070 You worry about those fighters!<br />I’ll worry about the tower!
6680949 6684800 R2, that stabilizer’s broken loose again.<br />See if you can’t lock it down.
6693862 6695992 Fighters coming in .3.
6704405 6706175 I’m hit!<br />I can’t stay with you!
6706275 6708510 Get clear, Wedge.<br />You can’t do any more good back there.
6708610 6710210 Sorry.
6710779 6713013 Let him go.<br />Stay on the leader.
6715284 6718284 Hurry, Luke. They’re coming in much faster<br />this time. We can’t hold them.
6721800 6723900 R2, try and increase the power.
6730065 6732865 <i>Hurry up, Luke!<br />Wait! Quick!</i>
6740109 6743000 <i>Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.</i>
6743145 6745045 I’m on the leader.
6747716 6749415 Hang on, R2.
6764899 6767299 <i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>
6770138 6772163 <i>Let go, Luke.</i>
6773842 6776178 The Force is strong with this one.
6776278 6778378 <i>Luke, trust me.</i>
6783518 6784919 <i>His computer’s off.</i>
6785019 6787590 <i>Luke, you switched off your<br />targeting computer! What’s wrong?</i>
6787690 6789690 <i>Nothing. I’m all right.</i>
6803438 6805038 <i>I’ve lost R2!</i>
6806141 6808141 <i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>
6808477 6810477 <i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>
6811513 6815513 - <i>Rebel base in range.</i><br />- You may fire when ready.
6816051 6818051 <i>Commence primary ignition.</i>
6831700 6833561 I have you now.
6835300 6837000 - What?<br />- Yahoo!
6839241 6840941 Look out!
6846815 6850148 You’re all clear, kid!<br />Now let’s blow this thing and go home!
6856658 6858258 <i>Stand by.</i>
6861429 6863029 <i>Stand by.</i>
6873008 6875408 Great shot, kid!<br />That was one in a million!
6876311 6880511 <i>Remember, the Force<br />will be with you always.</i>
6900034 6901534 Luke!
6904873 6906274 Hey! Hey!
6906374 6908043 I knew you’d come back.<br />I just knew it.
6908143 6910255 Well, I wasn’t going to let you get<br />all the credit and take all the reward.
6910279 6913279 Hey, I knew there was<br />more to you than money.
6913848 6917448 - Oh, no!<br />- Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?
6917886 6920789 Say something.<br />You can repair him, can’t you?
6920889 6924259 - We’ll get to work on him right away.<br />- You must repair him.
6924359 6927361 Sir, if any of my circuits or gears<br />will help, I’ll gladly donate them.
6927362 6929462 He’ll be all right.
