465465 469666 Don’t act so surprised, Your Highness.<br />You weren’t on any mercy mission this time.
469967 473740 Several transmissions were<br />beamed to this ship by rebel spies.
473840 476709 I want to know what happened<br />to the plans they sent you.

491223 493524 Holding her is dangerous.<br />If word of this gets out...
493624 496227 it could generate sympathy<br />for the rebellion in the Senate.

498760 501628 Now she is my only link<br />to finding their secret base.
501901 503616 She’ll die before she’ll tell you anything.
503640 504701 Leave that to me.
505402 509309 Send a distress signal and then inform<br />the Senate that all aboard were killed.
509409 512401 Lord Vader, the battle station plans<br />are not aboard this ship...
512501 514407 and no transmissions were made.
514507 518108 An escape pod was jettisoned during the<br />fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
518708 521049 She must have hidden the plans<br />in the escape pod.
521149 524791 Send a detachment down to retrieve them.<br />See to it personally, Commander.

1023922 1027322 Doesn’t look like we have much<br />of a choice, but I’ll remind him.
1037768 1040768 Yeah, we’ll take that red one.<br />No, not that one.
1043909 1046709 You, I suppose you’re programmed<br />for etiquette and protocol.
1046810 1050649 Protocol? Why, it’s my primary function,<br />sir. I am well-versed in all the customs—
1050749 1053551 - I have no need for a protocol droid.<br />- Of course you haven’t, sir.
1053651 1056655 Not in an environment such as this.<br />That is why I have been programmed—
1056755 1061056 What I really need is a droid who understands<br />the binary language of moisture vaporators.
1061156 1064327 Vaporators? Sir, my first job<br />was programming binary load lifters...
1064427 1066828 very similar to your vaporators<br />in most respects.
1066928 1068976 - Can you speak Bocce?<br />- Of course I can, sir. It’s like
1069000 1070057 a second language to me.

1175941 1180142 - Is there anything I might do to help?<br />- No. Not unless you can alter time...
1180242 1183242 speed up the harvest,<br />or teleport me off this rock.
1183448 1184463 I don’t think so, sir.
1184487 1187686 I’m only a droid, and<br />not very knowledgeable about such things
1187986 1189218 not on this planet, anyway.
1189242 1193025 As a matter of fact, I’m not<br />even sure which planet I’m on.

1195665 1198063 you’re on the planet<br />that it’s farthest from.

1221201 1224076 we’re in as good condition as we are,<br />what with the rebellion and all.
1224100 1225900 You know of the rebellion<br />against the Empire?!
1225924 1229124 That’s how we came to be in your service,<br />if you take my meaning, sir.
1229825 1231926 - Have you been in many battles?<br />- Several, I think.
1232026 1235801 Actually, there’s not much to tell.<br />I’m not much more than an interpreter...
1235901 1240169 and not very good at telling stories. Well,<br />not at making them interesting, anyway.
1241239 1245174 Well, my little friend, you’ve got<br />something jammed in here real good.
1245444 1247244 Were you on a Starcruiser or—
1247545 1250748 <i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br />You’re my only hope.</i>
1250849 1252450 What’s this? [ R2-D2 BEEPS ]
1252550 1255521 “What is what?” He asked you a question.<br />What is that?

1266800 1270201 [ R2-D2 BEEPS ]<br />Oh. He says it’s nothing, sir.
1270301 1273505 Merely a malfunction.<br />Old data. Pay it no mind.
1273705 1276008 Who is she? She’s beautiful.
1276108 1279478 I’m afraid I’m not quite sure, sir.
1279578 1281980 I think she was a passenger<br />on our last voyage.
1282080 1285283 A person of some importances, I believe.<br />Our captain was attached to—
1285383 1288685 Is there any more to this recording?<br />[ R2-D2 BEEPS AND WHISTLES ]
1288785 1291657 Behave yourself, R2.<br />You’re going to get us into trouble.
1291857 1294700 It’s all right. You can trust him.<br />He’s our new master.
1294800 1296800 [ R2-D2 CHATTERS RAPIDLY ]<br /><i>You’re my only hope.</i>
1297996 1300732 He says that he’s the property<br />of Obi-Wan Kenobi...
1300832 1304236 a resident of these parts,<br />and it’s a private message for him.
1304336 1306381 Quite frankly, sir, I don’t know what<br />he’s talking about.
1306405 1309901 Our last master was Captain Antilles.<br />But with all we’ve been through...
1310001 1313245 this little R2 unit has become a bit<br />eccentric. [ R2-D2 SPUTTERS RUDELY ]
1313645 1316381 Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br />I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.
1316681 1319201 I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know<br />what he’s talking about?
1319251 1324700 Well, I don’t know anyone named Obi-Wan,<br />but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.
1324800 1327000 He’s kind of a strange old hermit.
1327593 1330762 I wonder who she is.<br />Sounds like she’s in trouble.
1330862 1334503 I better play back the whole thing.<br />[ R2-D2 BEEPS ]
1336466 1339666 He says the restraining bolt<br />has short-circuited his recording system.
1340305 1342501 He suggests that if you remove the bolt...
1342601 1344744 he might be able to play back<br />the entire recording.
1344844 1347546 Hm? Oh, yeah. Well...
1347646 1350082 I guess you’re too small<br />to run away on me...
1350182 1352282 if I take this off. Okay...
1355420 1357220 There you go.
1358700 1361700 Wait a minute. Where’d she go? Bring<br />her back. Play back the entire message.
1361783 1363484 [ R2-D2 SPUTTERS ]<br />“What message?”
1363584 1365385 The one you’ve just been playing!
1365485 1367445 The one you’re carrying<br />inside your rusty innards.
1367700 1369626 AUNT BERU: Luke! Luke!
1370101 1371984 All right, I’ll be right there, Aunt Beru.
1372008 1375641 I’m sorry, sir but he appears<br />to have picked up a slight flutter.
1375741 1379170 Here. See what you can do with him.<br />I’ll be right back.
1379800 1381600 [ R2-D2 HUMS SHEEPISHLY ]
1381901 1384402 Just you reconsider<br />playing that message for him.
1384502 1385950 [ R2-D2 BEEPS QUESTIONINGLY ]
1386050 1388920 No, I don’t think he likes you at all.<br />[ R2-D2 WHISTLES ]
1389020 1392186 No, I don’t like you, either.<br />[ R2-D2 HUMS SADLY ]
1399329 1402065 You know, I think that R2 unit<br />we bought might have been stolen.
1402165 1403768 What makes you think that?
1403868 1405880 Well, I stumbled across a recording<br />while I was cleaning him.
1405904 1408873 He says he belongs to someone<br />called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1411609 1415411 I thought he might have meant old Ben.<br />Do you know what he’s talking about?
1417547 1421981 - I wonder if he’s related to Ben.<br />- That wizard’s just a crazy old man.
1422452 1426080 Tomorrow, I want you to take that R2 unit<br />to Anchorhead and have its memory erased.
1426258 1429460 That’ll be the end of it.<br />It belongs to us now.
1430161 1433201 But what if this Obi-Wan<br />comes looking for him?
1433301 1438701 He won’t. I don’t think he exists anymore.<br />He died about the same time as your father.
1439270 1442070 - He knew my father?<br />- I told you to forget it.
1443440 1446200 Your only concern is to prepare<br />those new droids for tomorrow.
1446700 1448925 In the morning, I want them<br />up there on the south ridge...
1448949 1452049 - working on those condensers.<br />- Yes, sir.
1453684 1455887 I think those new droids<br />are gonna work out fine.
1455987 1459424 In fact, I, uh, was also thinking<br />about our agreement...
1459524 1463401 about me staying on another season...
1463801 1465876 and if these new droids do work out,<br />I want to transmit my application...
1465900 1468701 - to the academy this year.<br />- You mean the next semester...
1468801 1472001 - before the harvest?<br />- Sure. There’s more than enough droids.
1472101 1475301 Harvest is when I need you the most.<br />It’s only one season more.
1476400 1478882 This year we’ll make enough on the harvest
