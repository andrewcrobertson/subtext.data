159028 160859 Did you hear that?
160988 162546 They shut down the main reactor.
162668 164126 We'll be destroyed for sure.
164248 165124 This is madness.
175008 176157 We're doomed.
178588 183059 There'll be no escape<br />for the princess this time.
183988 185023 What's that?
283468 285777 R2-D2, where are you?
301228 302263 At last!
302388 304060 Where have you been?
304188 305303 They're heading in this direction.
305428 307146 What are we going to do?
307268 308940 We'll be sent to<br />the spice mines of Kessel ...
309068 310467 smashed into who knows what!
311708 314381 Wait a minute.<br />Where are you going?
325748 328581 ~ The Death Star plans<br />are not in the main computer. ~
328708 331222 Where are those transmissions<br />you intercepted?
331348 334021 What have you done with those plans?
334148 336867 We intercepted no transmissions.
336988 338660 This is a consular ship.
338788 340779 We're on a diplomatic mission.
340908 343024 If this is a consular ship ...
343148 345264 where is the ambassador?
348628 351859 Commander, tear this ship apart<br />until you've found those plans ...
351988 354866 and bring me the passengers!<br />I want them alive!
366908 368387 There's one. Set for stun.
373668 375420 She'll be all right.
375548 377345 Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
377468 380460 Hey! You're not permitted in there.<br />It's restricted.
380588 383227 You'll be deactivated for sure.
385148 386422 Don't you call me<br />a mindless philosopher ...
386548 387617 you overweight glob of grease!
387748 389306 Now come out before<br />somebody sees you.
391628 393380 Secret mission?<br />What plans?
393508 394736 What are you talking about?
394868 396267 I'm not getting in there.
398908 400705 I'm going to regret this.
407868 409187 There goes another one.
409308 411344 Hold your fire.<br />There's no life forms.
411468 413060 It must have short-circuited.
413188 417340 That's funny. The damage<br />doesn't look as bad from out here.
417468 419265 Are you sure this thing is safe?
421308 422343 Oh.
437628 441064 Darth Vader.<br />Only you could be so bold.
441188 443418 The Imperial Senate will<br />not sit still for this.
443548 444617 When they hear you've<br />attacked a diplomatic ...
444748 446147 Don't act so surprised,<br />Your Highness.
446268 448623 You weren't on any<br />mercy mission this time.
448748 452661 Several transmissions were<br />beamed to this ship by rebel spies.
452788 455507 I want to know what happened<br />to the plans they sent you.
455628 457266 I don't know what<br />you're talking about.
457388 459026 I'm a member of the Imperial Senate ...
459148 460501 on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.
460628 463347 You are part of the Rebel Alliance<br />and a traitor.
463468 464981 Take her away!
468868 470460 Holding her is dangerous.
470588 472067 If word of this gets out ...
472188 473906 it could generate sympathy<br />for the rebellion in the senate.
474028 476496 I've traced the rebel spies to her.
476628 479188 Now she is my only link<br />to finding their secret base.
479308 481583 She'll die before<br />she'll tell you anything.
481708 482936 Leave that to me.
483068 484581 Send a distress signal ...
484708 486858 and then inform the senate<br />that all aboard were killed.
486988 488307 Lord Vader,<br />the battle station plans ...
488428 489543 are not aboard this ship ...
489668 491021 and no transmissions were made.
491148 493537 An escape pod was jettisoned<br />during the fighting ...
493668 495147 but no life forms were aboard.
495268 497907 She must have hidden<br />the plans in the escape pod.
498028 501623 Send a detachment down to retrieve<br />them ... See to it personally, Commander.
501748 504137 There'll be no one<br />to stop us this time.
504268 505303 Yes, sir.
517708 520905 How did we get into this mess?
521028 523588 I really don't know how.
523708 525221 We seem to be made to suffer.
525348 526622 It's our lot in life.
528748 531820 I've got to rest before I fall apart.
531948 533825 My joints are almost frozen.
539428 542022 What a desolate place this is!
546188 547780 Where do you think you're going?
547908 549500 Well, I'm not going that way.
549628 551141 It's much too rocky.
551268 553020 This way is much easier.
553148 554979 What makes you think ...
555108 556905 there are settlements over there?
558428 559827 Don't get technical with me.
559948 563065 What mission?<br />What are you talking about?
564908 567342 I've just about had enough of you.
567468 568787 Go that way.
568908 570705 You'll be malfunctioning within a day ...
570828 572341 you nearsighted scrap pile.
572468 574698 And don't let me catch you<br />following me begging for help ...
574828 576227 because you won't get it.
589748 591340 No more adventures.
591468 593345 I'm not going that way.
625668 626987 That malfunctioning little twerp.
627108 629099 This is all his fault.
629228 631788 He tricked me into going this way ...
631908 633705 but he'll do no better.
637308 638866 Wait! What's that?
638988 640307 A transport.
640428 642020 I'm saved!
642148 643786 Over here!
643908 644897 Hey!
645028 646620 Hey!
646748 650104 Help! Please help!
851308 852582 R2?
855948 859338 R2-D2, it is you! It is you!
892148 893376 Someone was in the pod.
893508 896068 The tracks go off in this direction.
896188 898019 Look, sir, droids.
912068 913581 We stopped.
913708 915300 Wake up! Wake up!
921108 922905 We're doomed.
930428 932419 Do you think they'll melt us down?
945748 947545 Don't shoot!<br />Don't shoot!
947668 949226 Will this never end?
988508 989827 All right, fine. Let's go.
989948 991984 Luke! Luke!
995228 998265 Luke, tell Uncle<br />if he gets a translator ...
998388 1000060 be sure it speaks Bocce.
1000188 1002577 Doesn't look like we have much<br />of a choice, but I'll remind him.
1012068 1014582 Yeah, we'll take that red one.
1014708 1016664 No, not that one.
1019548 1021857 I suppose you're programmed<br />for etiquette and protocol.
1021988 1023307 Protocol? Why, it's<br />my primary function, sir.
1023428 1025783 I am well-versed in all the customs ...
1025908 1027466 I have no need for a protocol droid.
1027588 1029067 Of course you haven't, sir.
1029188 1030337 Not in an environment such as this.
1030468 1031696 That is why I have<br />been programmed ...
1031828 1033864 What I really need is<br />a droid who understands ...
1033988 1035785 the binary language<br />of moisture vaporators.
1035908 1039059 Vaporators? Sir, my first job<br />was programming binary load lifters ...
1039188 1039828 very similar to your vaporators<br />in most respects.
1039863 1040385 very similar to your vaporators<br />in most respects.
1040508 1042066 Can you speak Bocce?
1042188 1044622 Of course I can, sir.<br />It's like a second language to me ...
1044748 1045976 Yeah, all right. Shut up.<br />I'll take this one.
1046108 1047336 Luke!
1049828 1051819 Take these two over<br />to the garage, will you?
1051948 1053063 I want them cleaned up before dinner.
1053188 1054177 But I was going into Tosche Station ...
1054308 1055627 to pick up some power converters.
1055748 1057147 You can waste time<br />with your friends ...
1057268 1058667 when your chores are done.
1058788 1060665 Now come on. Get to it.
1060788 1062824 All right. Come on.
1065468 1067379 And the red one. Come on.
1068628 1070937 Well, come on, red. Let's go.
1088628 1089617 Uncle Owen!
1089748 1091067 Yeah?
1091188 1093782 This R2 unit has<br />a bad motivator. Look.
1093908 1096183 Hey, what are you<br />trying to push on us?
1098468 1099981 Excuse me, sir ...
1100108 1103418 but that R2 unit is in prime condition,<br />a real bargain.
1103548 1105743 Uncle Owen, what about that one?
1105868 1107142 What about that blue one?
1107268 1109498 We'll take that one.
1109628 1110777 Take this away.
1110908 1112182 You'll be very pleased<br />with that one, sir.
1112308 1114026 He really is in first-class condition.
1114148 1115297 I've worked with him before.
1115428 1116224 Here he comes.
1119908 1121227 O.K. Let's go.
1121348 1123100 Now, don't you forget this.
1123228 1124900 Why I should stick<br />my neck out for you ...
1125028 1126859 is quite beyond my capacity.
1132428 1134146 Thank the maker!
1134268 1136179 This oil bath is going to feel so good.
1136308 1139778 I've got such a bad case<br />of dust contamination ...
1139908 1140897 I can barely move.
1141028 1142017 It just isn't fair.
1142148 1143627 Oh, Biggs is right.
1143748 1145943 I'm never gonna get out of here.
1146068 1147945 Is there anything I might do to help?
1148068 1150377 No. Not unless you can alter time ...
1150508 1152783 speed up the harvest,<br />or teleport me off this rock.
1152908 1154421 I don't think so, sir.
1154548 1155822 I'm only a droid ...
1155948 1157301 and not very knowledgeable<br />about such things ...
1157428 1159066 not on this planet, anyway.
1159188 1162419 As a matter of fact,<br />I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
1162548 1164823 Well, if there's<br />a bright center to the universe ...
1164948 1167257 you're on the planet<br />that it's farthest from.
1167388 1168457 I see, sir.
1168588 1170226 You can call me Luke.
1170348 1171667 I see, Sir Luke.
1171788 1172937 Ha ha.
1173068 1174262 Just Luke.
1174388 1177903 Oh ... And I am C-3PO,<br />human-cyborg relations.
1178028 1180303 This is my counterpart ... R2-D2.
1180428 1181577 Hello.
1182828 1184944 You got a lot of carbon scoring.
1185068 1187024 Looks like you boys have<br />seen a lot of action.
1187148 1188706 With all we've been through ...
1188828 1190500 sometimes I'm amazed we're in<br />as good condition as we are ...
1190628 1191947 what with the rebellion and all.
1192068 1193865 You know of the rebellion<br />against the Empire?!
1193988 1195944 That's how we came<br />to be in your service ...
1196068 1197387 if you take my meaning, sir.
1197508 1198577 Have you been in many battles?
1198708 1199936 Several, I think.
1200068 1201501 Actually, there's not much to tell.
1201628 1203380 I'm not much more<br />than an interpreter ...
1203508 1205260 and not very good at telling stories.
1205388 1207618 Well, not at making them<br />interesting, anyway.
1207748 1209625 Well, my little friend ...
1209748 1212421 you got something jammed<br />in here real good.
1212548 1213867 Were you on a Starcruiser or ...
1213988 1217219 Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br />You're my only hope.
1217348 1219304 What's this?
1219428 1221339 "What is what"?<br />He asked you a question.
1221468 1222378 What is that?
1222508 1223827 Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1223948 1225984 You're my only hope.
1229628 1231186 Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1231308 1232946 You're my only hope.
1234548 1237187 He says it's nothing, sir,<br />merely a malfunction.
1237308 1239617 Old data. Pay it no mind.
1239748 1242023 Who is she?<br />She's beautiful.
1242148 1245345 I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
1245468 1247743 I think she was a passenger<br />on our last voyage.
1247868 1249506 A person of some importance, I believe.
1249628 1250663 Our captain was attached ...
1250788 1251903 Is there any more<br />to this recording?
1253868 1255187 Behave yourself, R2.
1255308 1257026 You're going to get us into trouble.
1257148 1259787 It's all right. You can trust him.<br />He's our new master.
1262468 1265699 He says that he's the property<br />of Obi-Wan Kenobi ...
1265828 1267227 a resident of these parts ...
1267348 1269066 and it's a private message for him.
1269188 1271065 Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what<br />he's talking about.
1271188 1273065 Our last master<br />was Captain Antilles.
1273188 1274587 But with all<br />we've been through ...
1274708 1277620 this little R2 unit has<br />become a bit eccentric.
1277748 1280740 Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br />I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.
1280868 1283382 I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know<br />what he's talking about?
1283508 1285305 I don't know any Obi-Wan ...
1285428 1288659 but old Ben lives out<br />beyond the Dune Sea.
1288788 1290460 He's kind of a strange old hermit.
1290588 1291941 Help me,<br />Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1292068 1293467 I wonder who she is.
1293588 1294577 Sounds like she's in trouble.
1294708 1296505 I better play back the whole thing.
1298308 1300424 He says the restraining bolt ...
1300548 1303108 has short-circuited<br />his recording system.
1303228 1305901 He suggests that if you remove the bolt ...
1306028 1308223 he might be able to play<br />back the entire recording.
1308348 1310623 Oh, yeah. Well ...
1310748 1313057 I guess you're too small<br />to run away on me ...
1313188 1314337 if I take this off.
1314468 1315423 OK ...
1317908 1319739 There you go.
1319868 1321779 Wait a minute.<br />Where'd she go?
1321908 1324263 Bring her back.<br />Play back the entire message.
1324388 1325423 "What message"?
1325548 1327618 The one you've just been playing!
1327748 1329659 The one you're carrying<br />inside your rusty innards.
1329788 1331779 Luke! Luke!
1331908 1333261 All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
1333388 1334787 I'm sorry, sir ...
1334908 1337581 but he appears to have<br />picked up a slight flutter.
1337708 1339266 Here. See what you can do with him.
1339388 1340946 I'll be right back.
1342548 1346177 Just you reconsider playing<br />that message for him.
1347508 1349624 No, I don't think he likes you at all.
1349748 1351978 No, I don't like you, either.
1358308 1361459 You know, I think that R2 unit<br />we bought might have been stolen.
1361588 1364056 What makes you think that?
1364188 1366497 Well, I stumbled across a recording<br />while I was cleaning him.
1366628 1369461 He says he belongs to someone<br />called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1371308 1373583 I thought he might have meant old Ben.
1373708 1375061 Do you know what<br />he's talking about?
1375188 1376143 Mm-mm.
1376268 1379226 I wonder if he's related to Ben.
1379428 1381020 That wizard's just a crazy old man.
1381148 1384379 Tomorrow, I want you to take<br />that R2 unit to Anchorhead ...
1384508 1385907 and have its memory erased.
1386028 1387905 That'll be the end of it.<br />It belongs to us now.
1389588 1392102 But what if this Obi-Wan<br />comes looking for him?
1392228 1393217 He won't.
1393348 1395623 I don't think he exists any more.
1395748 1398023 He died about the same time<br />as your father.
1398148 1399342 He knew my father?
1399468 1401106 I told you to forget it.
1401228 1405426 Your only concern is to prepare<br />those new droids for tomorrow.
1405548 1407379 In the morning, I want them<br />up there on the south ridge ...
1407508 1409260 working on those condensers.
1409388 1410377 Yes, sir.
1411908 1414217 I think those new droids<br />are gonna work out fine.
1414348 1417897 In fact, I, uh, was also thinking<br />about our agreement ...
1418028 1421100 about me staying on another season?
1421228 1423298 And if these new droids<br />do work out ...
1423428 1425259 I want to transmit my application<br />to the academy this year.
1425388 1428027 You mean the next semester<br />before the harvest?
1428148 1429866 Sure. There's more<br />than enough droids.
1429988 1431899 Harvest is when I need you the most.
1432028 1433939 It's only one season more.
1434068 1435581 This year we'll make<br />enough on the harvest ...
1435708 1437221 that I'll be able<br />to hire more hands ...
1437348 1440146 and then you can go<br />to the academy next year.
1440268 1441906 You must understand<br />I need you here, Luke.
1442028 1443700 But it's a whole 'nother year!
1443828 1445181 Look, it's only one more season.
1445308 1447299 Yeah, that's what you said<br />when Biggs and Tank left.
1447428 1448304 Where are you going?
1448428 1449577 Looks like I'm going nowhere.
1449708 1451426 I have to go finish<br />cleaning those droids.
1451548 1453379 Owen, he can't stay here forever.
1453508 1454736 Most of his friends have gone.
1454868 1456859 It means so much to him.
1456988 1458660 I'll make it up to him next year.
1458788 1459743 I promise.
1459868 1463099 Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
1463228 1465139 He has too much of his father in him.
1465268 1467224 That's what I'm afraid of.
1512748 1514386 Ooh!
1514508 1515861 What are you doing<br />hiding back there?
1515988 1519139 It wasn't my fault, sir.<br />Please don't deactivate me.
1519268 1521987 I told him not to go,<br />but he's faulty, malfunctioning.
1522108 1523587 Kept babbling on about his mission.
1523708 1525266 Oh, no.
1532748 1535581 That R2 unit has always<br />been a problem.
1535708 1538097 These astrodroids<br />are getting quite out of hand.
1538228 1540105 Even I can't understand<br />their logic at times.
1540228 1541627 How could I be so stupid?
1541748 1542863 He's nowhere in sight.
1542988 1544262 Blast it!
1544388 1546697 Pardon me, sir,<br />but couldn't we go after him?
1546828 1548420 It's too dangerous<br />with all the Sandpeople around.
1548548 1550504 We'll have to wait until morning.
1550628 1551777 Luke! I'm shutting the power down.
1551908 1554183 All right!<br />I'll be there in a few minutes.
1554308 1555707 Boy, am I gonna get it.
1555828 1558547 That little droid's going to<br />cause me a lotta trouble.
1558668 1560898 Oh, he excels at that, sir.
1561948 1563347 Come on.
1570508 1571657 Luke?
1572868 1573983 Luke!
1575428 1576702 Luke!
1582188 1584383 Have you seen Luke this morning?
1584508 1586419 He said he had some things to do<br />before he started today ...
1586548 1587776 so he left early.
1587908 1589261 Did he take those<br />two new droids with him?
1589388 1590787 I think so.
1590908 1593376 Well, he better have those units<br />in the south range ...
1593508 1595863 repaired by midday,<br />or there'll be hell to pay.
1596068 1597786 Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner.
1597908 1599341 Dead ahead.
1599468 1602346 It might be our little R2 unit.<br />Hit the accelerator!
1622708 1625381 Hey, whoa! Where do<br />you think you're going?
1626748 1628420 Master Luke is your rightful owner now.
1628548 1631426 We'll have no more<br />of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.
1632948 1634142 And don't talk to me<br />of your mission, either.
1634268 1635462 You're fortunate he doesn't blast you ...
1635588 1636941 into a million pieces right here!
1637068 1639059 No. It's all right,<br />but I think we'd better go.
1640708 1642539 What's wrong with him now?
1642668 1644818 There are several creatures<br />approaching from the southeast.
1644948 1648623 Sandpeople, or worse.
1648748 1650545 Come on.<br />Let's go have a look.
1650668 1651703 Come on!
1653708 1656859 Well, there are<br />two Banthas down there ...
1656988 1658865 but I don't see any ...<br />Wait a second.
1658988 1660307 They're Sandpeople, all right.
1660428 1663067 I can see one of them now.
1733868 1735426 Hello, there.
1737748 1740865 Come here, my little friend.<br />Don't be afraid.
1742868 1745143 Oh, don't worry.<br />He'll be all right.
1750828 1753501 Rest easy, son.<br />You've had a busy day.
1753628 1757223 You're fortunate<br />to be all in one piece.
1759588 1760816 Ben?
1760948 1762381 Ben Kenobi?
1762508 1764385 Boy, am I glad to see you.
1764508 1767386 The Jundland Wastes are not<br />to be traveled lightly.
1769468 1771459 Tell me, young Luke ...
1771588 1774341 what brings you out this far?
1774468 1776060 This little droid.
1778068 1779547 I think he's searching<br />for his former master ...
1779668 1782899 but I've never seen such devotion<br />in a droid before.
1783028 1784859 He claims to be the property ...
1784988 1786501 of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1786628 1787743 Is he a relative of yours?
1787868 1790143 Do you know who<br />he's talking about?
1790268 1792304 Obi-Wan Kenobi?
1793828 1795898 Obi-Wan.
1796028 1800738 Now, that's a name<br />I've not heard in a long time.
1800868 1803177 A long time.
1803308 1805503 I think my uncle knows him.
1805628 1807061 He said he was dead.
1807188 1808906 Oh, he's not dead.
1809028 1810097 Not yet.
1810228 1811581 You know him?
1811708 1814461 Well, of course I know him.<br />He's me.
1816468 1820177 I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan ...
1820308 1822617 since, oh, before you were born.
1822748 1824466 Well, then the droid<br />does belong to you.
1824588 1827182 I don't seem to remember<br />ever owning a droid.
1828908 1830057 Very interesting.
1831548 1834267 I think we better get indoors.
1834388 1836743 The Sandpeople are easily startled ...
1836868 1840099 but they'll soon be back,<br />and in greater numbers.
1842828 1844181 3PO.
1853148 1855742 Where am I?<br />I must have taken a bad step.
1857188 1858701 Can you stand?
1858828 1860307 We've got to get out of here before<br />the Sandpeople return.
1860428 1862817 I don't think I can make it.<br />You go on, Master Luke.
1862948 1865508 There's no sense in you risking yourself<br />on my account.
1865628 1866947 I'm done for.
1867068 1868740 No, you're not.
1868868 1869857 What kind of talk is that?
1869988 1871546 Quickly. They're on the move.
1876188 1878144 No, my father didn't<br />fight in the wars.
1878268 1879940 He was a navigator<br />on a spice freighter.
1880068 1881820 That's what your uncle told you.
1881948 1883666 He didn't hold<br />with your father's ideals.
1883788 1884903 Thought he should<br />have stayed here ...
1885028 1886780 and not gotten involved.
1886908 1888739 You fought in the Clone Wars?
1888868 1891621 Yes. I was once a Jedi knight ...
1891748 1892976 the same as your father.
1895468 1897140 I wish I'd known him.
1897268 1900897 He was the best starpilot in the galaxy ...
1901028 1902507 and a cunning warrior.
1902628 1903504 I understand you've become ...
1903628 1906222 quite a good pilot yourself.
1906348 1909101 And he was a good friend.
1909228 1911264 Which reminds me ...
1911388 1913982 I have something here for you.
1916068 1918787 Your father wanted you to have this ...
1918908 1920227 when you were old enough ...
1920348 1922304 but your uncle<br />wouldn't allow it.
1922428 1923907 He feared you might<br />follow old Obi-Wan ...
1924028 1925905 on some damn-fool<br />idealistic crusade ...
1926028 1927700 like your father did.
1927828 1929546 Sir, if you'll not be needing me ...
1929668 1930578 I'll close down for a while.
1930708 1932300 Sure. Go ahead.
1933628 1935380 What is it?
1935508 1938147 It's your father's lightsaber.
1938268 1941385 This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.
1941508 1944978 Not as clumsy or random<br />as a blaster.
1945108 1950944 An elegant weapon<br />for a more civilized age.
1951068 1953184 For over a thousand generations ...
1953308 1955105 the Jedi knights were the guardians ...
1955228 1958140 of peace and justice<br />in the old Republic ...
1958268 1960941 before the dark times ...
1961068 1962581 before the Empire.
1965028 1967337 How did my father die?
1968628 1971540 A young Jedi named Darth Vader ...
1971668 1974660 who was a pupil of mine<br />until he turned to evil ...
1974788 1978622 helped the Empire hunt down<br />and destroy the Jedi knights.
1980148 1982662 He betrayed and<br />murdered your father.
1982788 1986542 Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
1986668 1991344 Vader was seduced<br />by the dark side of the Force.
1991468 1992901 The Force?
1993028 1996259 The Force is what gives<br />a Jedi his power.
1996388 2000267 It's an energy field created<br />by all living things.
2000388 2002140 It surrounds us, penetrates us ...
2002268 2004224 it binds the galaxy together.
2010428 2014341 Now let's see if we can't figure out<br />what you are, my little friend ...
2014468 2016299 and where you come from.
2016428 2017941 I saw part of a message he was ...
2018068 2019979 I seem to have found it.
2020108 2024021 General Kenobi, years ago<br />you served my father in the Clone Wars.
2024148 2025422 Now he begs you to help him ...
2025548 2027664 in his struggle against the Empire.
2027788 2030427 I regret that I am unable to present<br />my father's request to you in person.
2030548 2032425 But my ship has fallen under attack ...
2032548 2034664 and I am afraid my mission<br />to bring you to Alderaan has failed.
2034788 2036426 I have placed information ...
2036548 2038106 vital to the survival<br />of the rebellion ...
2038228 2039980 into the memory systems<br />of this R2 unit.
2040108 2041826 My father will know<br />how to retrieve it.
2041948 2043506 You must see this droid ...
2043628 2046062 safely delivered to him on Alderaan.
2046188 2047826 This is our most desperate hour.
2047948 2051861 Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br />You're my only hope.
2065388 2067822 You must learn<br />the ways of the Force ...
2067948 2070064 if you're to come<br />with me to Alderaan.
2070188 2072497 Alderaan?<br />I'm not going to Alderaan.
2072628 2074027 I've got to get home.
2074148 2075422 It's late.<br />I'm in for it as it is.
2075548 2078187 I need your help, Luke.<br />She needs your help.
2078308 2081300 I'm getting too old<br />for this sort of thing.
2085188 2086507 I can't get involved.
2086628 2088903 I've got work to do.
2089028 2091462 It's not that I like the Empire.<br />I hate it ...
2091588 2094660 but there's nothing<br />I can do about it right now.
2094788 2096824 It's all such a long way from here.
2096948 2098825 That's your uncle talking.
2098948 2100097 My uncle.
2100228 2102617 How am I ever gonna explain this?
2102748 2104420 Learn about the Force, Luke.
2111108 2113258 Look, I can take you<br />as far as Anchorhead.
2113388 2117222 You can get a transport there to<br />Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
2117348 2121136 You must do what you feel<br />is right, of course.
2128588 2130544 Until this battle station<br />is fully operational ...
2130668 2132021 we are vulnerable.
2132148 2134104 The Rebel Alliance<br />is too well equipped.
2134228 2136105 They're more dangerous<br />than you realize.
2136228 2138503 Dangerous to<br />your starfleet, Commander ...
2138628 2140698 not to this battle station.
2140828 2143422 The rebellion will<br />continue to gain support ...
2143548 2145140 in the Imperial Senate ...
2145268 2148260 The Imperial Senate will no longer<br />be of any concern to us.
2148388 2149867 I have just received word ...
2149988 2152422 that the emperor has<br />dissolved the council permanently.
2152548 2154982 The last remnants<br />of the old Republic ...
2155108 2156461 have been swept away.
2156588 2158180 That's impossible.
2158308 2160458 How will the emperor maintain control<br />without the bureaucracy?
2160588 2163341 The regional governors<br />now have direct control ...
2163468 2165106 over their territories.
2165228 2169107 Fear will keep<br />the local systems in line ...
2169228 2170547 fear of this battle station.
2170668 2172420 And what of the rebellion?
2172548 2174345 If the rebels have obtained ...
2174468 2175662 a complete technical readout<br />of this station ...
2175788 2177380 it is possible, however unlikely ...
2177508 2179703 that they might find a weakness<br />and exploit it.
2179828 2183867 The plans you refer to will<br />soon be back in our hands.
2183988 2186297 Any attack made by the rebels<br />against this station ...
2186428 2187702 would be a useless gesture ...
2187828 2190058 no matter what technical data<br />they've obtained.
2190188 2193624 This station is now the ultimate power<br />in the universe.
2193748 2195943 I suggest we use it.
2196068 2197421 Don't be too proud ...
2197548 2199664 of this technological terror<br />you've constructed.
2199788 2203019 The ability to destroy<br />a planet is insignificant ...
2203148 2205298 next to the power of the Force.
2205428 2208704 Don't try to frighten us with<br />your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
2208828 2211626 Your sad devotion<br />to that ancient religion ...
2211748 2214103 hasn't helped you conjure up<br />the stolen data tapes ...
2214228 2216105 or given you<br />clairvoyance enough ...
2216228 2218344 to find the rebels'<br />hidden fortre ...
2224068 2226787 I find your lack<br />of faith disturbing.
2228668 2231136 Enough of this.<br />Vader, release him.
2231268 2232781 As you wish.
2234868 2236824 This bickering is pointless.
2236948 2241499 Lord Vader will provide us with<br />the location of the rebel fortress ...
2241628 2244301 by the time this station<br />is operational.
2244428 2246658 We will then crush the rebellion ...
2246788 2248141 with one swift stroke.
2254668 2256579 It looks like the Sandpeople<br />did this, all right.
2256708 2258346 Look. There's gaffi sticks,<br />Bantha tracks.
2258468 2259457 It's just, I've never heard of them ...
2259588 2260498 hitting anything this big before.
2260628 2261617 They didn't ...
2261748 2264103 but we are meant to think they did.
2264228 2266025 These tracks are side-by-side.
2266148 2268218 Sandpeople always ride single file ...
2268348 2270145 to hide their numbers.
2270268 2272463 These are the same Jawas<br />that sold us R2 and 3PO.
2272588 2275898 And these blast points,<br />too accurate ...
2276028 2277302 for Sandpeople.
2277428 2280704 Only imperial stormtroopers<br />are so precise.
2280828 2283865 But why would imperial troops<br />want to slaughter Jawas?
2288228 2290298 If they traced the robots here ...
2290428 2291577 they may have learned<br />who they sold them to ...
2291708 2293619 and that would lead<br />them back ... home!
2293748 2295227 Wait, Luke!
2295348 2297225 It's too dangerous!
2320068 2321501 Uncle Owen!
2321628 2323937 Aunt Beru!
2324068 2325342 Uncle Owen!
2372468 2373787 And now, Your Highness ...
2373908 2375705 we will discuss the location ...
2375828 2377978 of your hidden rebel base.
2419028 2420825 There's nothing you could<br />have done, Luke ...
2420948 2422427 had you been there.
2422548 2424186 You'd have been killed, too ...
2424308 2427744 and the droids would now be<br />in the hands of the Empire.
2427868 2431383 I want to come<br />with you to Alderaan.
2431508 2433180 There's nothing for me here now.
2433308 2435424 I want to learn<br />the ways of the Force ...
2435548 2436981 and become a Jedi<br />like my father.
2451588 2454307 Mos Eisley spaceport.
2454428 2459422 You will never find a more<br />wretched hive of scum and villainy.
2459548 2461425 We must be cautious.
2501188 2503304 How long have you<br />had these droids?
2503428 2504577 Three or four seasons.
2504708 2505936 They're up for sale<br />if you want them.
2506068 2507820 Let me see your identification.
2507948 2511099 You don't need to see<br />his identification.
2511228 2513458 We don't need to see<br />his identification.
2513588 2515818 These aren't the droids<br />you're looking for.
2515948 2518701 These aren't the droids<br />we're looking for.
2518828 2521103 He can go about his business.
2521228 2523503 You can go about your business.
2523628 2524538 Move along.
2524668 2525817 Move along.
2525948 2527063 Move along.
2541828 2545537 I can't abide those Jawas.<br />Disgusting creatures!
2545668 2548023 Go on, go on.
2549508 2551624 I can't understand how<br />we got by those troops.
2551748 2553067 I thought we were dead.
2553188 2555782 The Force can have<br />a strong influence ...
2555908 2557307 on the weak-minded.
2560228 2561741 Do you really think we're<br />gonna find a pilot here ...
2561868 2563347 that'll take us to Alderaan?
2563468 2566266 Most of the best freighter pilots<br />are to be found here ...
2566388 2567707 only watch your step.
2567828 2569466 This place can be a little rough.
2569588 2571579 I'm ready for anything.
2574948 2576427 Come along, R2.
2624828 2627740 Hey! We don't serve their kind here.
2627868 2628744 What?
2628868 2630381 Your droids,<br />they'll have to wait outside.
2630508 2631577 We don't want them here.
2631708 2632777 Why don't you wait<br />out by the speeder?
2632908 2633897 We don't want any trouble.
2634028 2635825 I heartily agree with you, sir.
2643948 2645063 Uh ...
2645188 2646416 I'll have one of those.
2680508 2682146 He doesn't like you.
2682268 2683940 I'm sorry.
2684068 2686536 I don't like you, either.
2686668 2688386 You just watch yourself.
2688508 2689623 We're wanted men.
2689748 2692865 I have the death sentence on 12 systems.
2692988 2694387 I'll be careful.
2694508 2695657 You'll be dead!
2695788 2697585 This little one's not worth the effort.
2697708 2699858 Come, let me get you something.
2706228 2708344 Aah!
2725828 2727261 I'm all right.
2728388 2730663 Chewbacca here is first mate ...
2730788 2733666 on a ship that might suit us.
2736548 2739858 I don't like the look of this.
2753748 2757627 Han Solo. I'm captain<br />of the Millennium Falcon.
2757748 2760945 Chewie here tells me you're looking<br />for passage to the Alderaan system.
2761068 2763263 Yes, indeed,<br />if it's a fast ship.
2763388 2766141 Fast ship? You've never heard<br />of the Millennium Falcon?
2766268 2768623 Should I have?
2768748 2771820 It's the ship that made the Kessel run<br />in less than 12 parsecs.
2773668 2775784 I've outrun imperial starships.
2775908 2777864 Not the local bulk cruisers,<br />mind you.
2777988 2780024 I'm talking about<br />the big Corellian ships now.
2781788 2783983 She's fast enough for you,<br />old man.
2784108 2785666 What's the cargo?
2785788 2788746 Only passengers ...<br />myself, the boy ...
2788868 2790301 two droids ...
2790428 2793226 and no questions asked.
2793348 2796226 What is it, some kind<br />of local trouble?
2796348 2799306 Let's just say we'd like to avoid ...
2799428 2801259 any imperial entanglements.
2801388 2804983 Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?
2805108 2807303 And it's gonna cost you<br />something extra.
2809028 2810746 10,000, all in advance.
2812348 2813576 10,000?
2813708 2817303 We could almost<br />buy our own ship for that!
2817428 2819544 But who's gonna fly it,<br />kid, you?
2819668 2821624 You bet I could.<br />I'm not such a bad pilot myself.
2821748 2824023 We don't have<br />to sit here and listen ...
2824148 2827106 We can pay you 2,000 now ...
2827228 2830106 plus 15 when<br />we reach Alderaan.
2830228 2832025 Seventeen, huh?
2833908 2837696 O.K. You guys got<br />yourselves a ship.
2837828 2839022 We'll leave as soon<br />as you're ready.
2839148 2840183 Docking Bay 94.
2840308 2841423 Ninety-four.
2843068 2845218 Looks like somebody's<br />beginning to take an interest ...
2845348 2847623 in your handiwork.
2847748 2849784 All right.<br />We'll check it out.
2861188 2862507 17,000!
2862628 2864107 Those guys must really<br />be desperate.
2864228 2866184 This could really save my neck.
2866308 2868822 Get back to the ship,<br />get it ready.
2868948 2870461 You'll have to sell your speeder.
2870588 2873785 That's O.K. I'm never coming back<br />to this planet again.
2876468 2878140 Yes, Greedo.
2878268 2879383 As a matter of fact,<br />I was just going to see your boss.
2879508 2881385 Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
2894308 2896378 Yeah, but this time I've got the money.
2900028 2902462 I don't have it with me.
2902588 2903179 Tell Jabba ...
2910868 2912426 Even I get boarded sometimes.
2912548 2914504 Do you think I had a choice?
2918668 2920624 Over my dead body.
2925988 2927216 I'll bet you have.
2940468 2942265 Sorry about the mess.
2951108 2954498 Her resistance to the mind probe<br />is considerable.
2954628 2957540 It'll be some time before we can<br />extract any information from her.
2957668 2959465 The final checkout is completed.
2959588 2961067 All systems are operational.
2961188 2962985 What course shall we set?
2963108 2964666 Perhaps she would respond ...
2964788 2966585 to an alternative<br />form of persuasion.
2966708 2968027 What do you mean?
2968148 2969945 I think it is time<br />we demonstrated ...
2970068 2971706 the full power of this station.
2971828 2973261 Set your course for Alderaan.
2973388 2974707 With pleasure.
2974828 2977023 Lock the door, R2.
2978228 2981379 Check this side of the street.
2984628 2987665 The door's locked.<br />Move on to the next.
2992588 2995307 I would much rather have<br />gone with Master Luke ...
2995428 2996827 than stay here with you.
2996948 2999143 I don't know what<br />all this trouble is about ...
2999268 3000860 but I'm sure<br />it must be your fault.
3001948 3003142 You watch your language.
3005108 3008100 All right. Give it to me.<br />I'll take it.
3008228 3009707 Look at this.
3009828 3011739 Ever since the XP-38 came out,<br />they just aren't in demand.
3011868 3013267 It'll be enough.
3035828 3037307 Right here, Jabba.
3038708 3040141 I've been waitin' for you.
3043228 3045219 You didn't think<br />I was gonna run, did you?
3056428 3058988 Look, Jabba, next time you want to<br />talk to me, come see me yourself.
3059108 3060336 Don't send one of these twerps.
3074068 3077140 Look, Jabba,<br />even I get boarded sometimes.
3078308 3080583 You think I had a choice?
3080708 3082380 But I got a nice, easy charter.
3082508 3084703 I'll pay ya back,<br />plus a little extra.
3084828 3086659 I just need a little more time.
3094628 3096459 Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.
3107708 3110222 Jabba ... you're a wonderful human being.
3118668 3120624 If the ship's as fast as he's boasting ...
3120748 3122022 we ought to do well.
3145028 3146825 What a piece of junk!
3146948 3149064 She'll make.5 past light speed.
3149188 3150587 She may not look like much ...
3150708 3152266 but she's got it<br />where it counts, kid.
3152388 3154948 I've made a lot of<br />special modifications myself.
3155068 3157423 But we're a little rushed,<br />so if you'll just get on board ...
3157548 3158901 we'll get outta here.
3163348 3164497 Hello, sir.
3173268 3174621 Which way?
3176188 3178418 All right, men,<br />load your weapons.
3179908 3182422 Stop that ship!<br />Blast them!
3191348 3192986 Chewie, get us out of here!
3194628 3198462 Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much<br />I hate space travel.
3216548 3217822 Looks like an imperial cruiser.
3217948 3218858 Our passengers must be hotter<br />than I thought.
3218988 3220501 Try and hold 'em off.
3220628 3222186 Angle the deflector shields<br />while I make the calculations ...
3222308 3223138 for the jump to light speed.
3232988 3234626 Stay sharp.<br />There's two more comin' in.
3234748 3236420 They're gonna try<br />and cut us off.
3236548 3238266 Why don't you outrun 'em?<br />I thought you said this thing was fast!
3238388 3240185 Watch your mouth, kid, or you're<br />gonna find yourself floating home.
3240308 3241582 We'll be safe enough ...
3241708 3243539 once we make the jump<br />to hyperspace.
3243668 3245465 Besides, I know a few maneuvers.<br />We'll lose 'em.
3249428 3251259 Here's where the fun begins.
3251388 3253140 How long before you can make<br />the jump to light speed?
3253268 3255828 It'll take a few moments to get<br />the coordinates from the navicomputer.
3255948 3257586 Are you kidding?<br />At the rate they're gaining?
3257708 3260745 Traveling through hyperspace<br />ain't like dustin' crops, boy!
3260868 3261857 Without precise calculations ...
3261988 3263023 we'd fly right through a star ...
3263148 3264547 or bounce too close<br />to a supernova ...
3264668 3266579 and that would end your trip<br />real quick, wouldn't it?
3266708 3267663 What's that flashing?
3267788 3268538 We're losing a deflector shield.
3268668 3269987 Go strap yourselves in.
3270108 3271860 I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.
3292028 3294303 We've entered the Alderaan system.
3294428 3295577 Governor Tarkin.
3295708 3297061 I should have expected ...
3297188 3298985 to find you holding Vader's leash.
3299108 3300587 I recognized your foul stench ...
3300708 3302585 when I was brought on board.
3303708 3305824 Charming to the last.
3305948 3308462 You don't know<br />how hard I found it ...
3308588 3310465 signing the order<br />to terminate your life.
3310588 3311703 I'm surprised you had the courage ...
3311828 3313227 to take the responsibility yourself.
3313348 3316260 Princess Leia,<br />before your execution ...
3316388 3317980 I would like you to be my guest ...
3318108 3321418 at a ceremony that will make<br />this battle station operational.
3321548 3324506 No star system will dare<br />oppose the emperor now.
3324628 3326937 The more you tighten<br />your grip, Tarkin ...
3327068 3329662 the more star systems<br />will slip through your fingers.
3329788 3332621 Not after we demonstrate<br />the power of this station.
3332748 3335023 In a way,<br />you have determined ...
3335148 3337867 the choice of the planet<br />that will be destroyed first.
3337988 3339740 Since you are reluctant ...
3339868 3342666 to provide us with the location<br />of the rebel base ...
3342788 3345541 I have chosen to test this station's<br />destructive power ...
3345668 3348546 on your home planet of Alderaan.
3348668 3349783 No! Alderaan is peaceful.
3349908 3351307 We have no weapons.<br />You can't possibly ...
3351428 3353339 You would prefer another target?<br />A military target?
3353468 3355857 Then name the system.
3357668 3360865 I grow tired of asking this,<br />so it will be the last time.
3360988 3363548 Where is the rebel base?
3366948 3369018 Dantooine.
3369148 3370501 They're on Dantooine.
3370628 3372903 There. You see, Lord Vader?
3373028 3374381 She can be reasonable.
3374508 3376226 Continue with the operation.<br />You may fire when ready.
3376348 3377747 What?
3377868 3379142 You're far too trusting.
3379268 3380667 Dantooine is too remote ...
3380788 3383177 to make an effective demonstration,<br />but don't worry.
3383308 3386061 We will deal with your rebel friends<br />soon enough.
3386188 3387223 No!
3388428 3390464 Commence primary ignition.
3412628 3415825 Are you all right?<br />What's wrong?
3415948 3418223 I felt a great disturbance<br />in the Force ...
3418348 3419781 as if millions of voices ...
3419908 3421705 suddenly cried out in terror ...
3421828 3423307 and were suddenly silenced.
3423428 3426067 I fear something terrible<br />has happened.
3427428 3429988 You'd better get on<br />with your exercises.
3431988 3434582 Well, you can forget your troubles<br />with those imperial slugs.
3434708 3436585 I told you I'd outrun them.
3440468 3442424 Don't everybody thank me at once.
3442548 3446826 Anyway, we should be at Alderaan<br />about 02:00 hours.
3454028 3455746 Now be careful, R2.
3463468 3464947 Argh!
3465068 3466740 He made a fair move.<br />Screaming about it can't help you.
3466868 3469541 Let him have it. It's not wise<br />to upset a Wookiee.
3469668 3471898 But, sir, nobody worries<br />about upsetting a droid.
3472028 3474940 That's 'cause a droid don't pull<br />people's arms out of their sockets ...
3475068 3476387 when they lose.
3476508 3478464 Wookiees are known to do that.
3478588 3480146 Grrr ...
3480268 3482623 I see your point, sir.
3482748 3484067 I suggest a new strategy, R2.
3484188 3485587 Let the Wookiee win.
3485708 3488097 Argh!
3502788 3506781 Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force<br />flowing through him.
3506908 3508819 You mean it controls your actions?
3508948 3511746 Partially, but it also<br />obeys your commands.
3516068 3518980 Hokey religions and<br />ancient weapons are no match ...
3519108 3520700 for a good blaster<br />at your side, kid.
3520828 3523023 You don't believe<br />in the Force, do you?
3523148 3526265 Kid, I've flown from<br />one side of this galaxy to the other.
3526388 3527867 I've seen a lot of strange stuff ...
3527988 3530183 but I've never seen anything<br />to make me believe ...
3530308 3533618 there's one all-powerful force<br />controlling everything.
3533748 3537661 There's no mystical<br />energy field controls my destiny.
3537788 3541576 It's all a lot of<br />simple tricks and nonsense.
3541708 3544461 I suggest you try it again, Luke.
3544588 3547386 This time, let go<br />your conscious self ...
3549268 3551304 and act on instinct.
3551428 3554579 With the blast shield down,<br />I can't even see.
3554708 3556027 How am I supposed to fight?
3556148 3557058 Your eyes can deceive you.
3557188 3558223 Don't trust them.
3567268 3569463 Stretch out with your feelings.
3583348 3585384 You see? You can do it.
3585508 3587066 I call it luck.
3587188 3589656 In my experience,<br />there's no such thing as luck.
3589788 3592063 Look, good against remotes<br />is one thing.
3592188 3594941 Good against the living,<br />that's something else.
3596348 3597906 Looks like we're coming<br />up on Alderaan.
3601108 3602336 You know, I did feel something.
3602468 3603583 I could almost see the remote.
3603708 3604584 That's good.
3604708 3606460 You've taken your first step ...
3606588 3608306 into a larger world.
3612588 3613657 Yes?
3613788 3616461 Our scout ships have<br />reached Dantooine.
3616588 3618385 They found the remains<br />of a rebel base ...
3618508 3620738 but they estimate that it has<br />been deserted for some time.
3620868 3624258 They are now conducting an extensive<br />search of the surrounding systems.
3624388 3627221 She lied. She lied to us!
3627348 3629942 I told you she would never ...
3630068 3632343 consciously betray the rebellion.
3632468 3634345 Terminate her immediately.
3637388 3638457 Stand by, Chewie.<br />Here we go.
3638588 3639907 Cut in the sublight engines.
3642108 3643666 What the ...
3644708 3646505 Arrghh arrgh!
3646628 3648903 We've come out of hyperspace<br />into a meteor shower.
3649028 3650177 Some kind of asteroid collision.
3650308 3651184 It's not on any of the charts.
3651308 3652502 What's going on?
3652628 3654778 Our position's correct,<br />except no Alderaan.
3654908 3656102 What do you mean?<br />Where is it?
3656228 3657422 That's what I'm trying<br />to tell you, kid.
3657548 3658867 It ain't there. It's<br />been totally blown away.
3658988 3659864 What? How?
3659988 3661546 Destroyed by the Empire.
3661668 3663863 The entire starfleet couldn't destroy<br />the whole planet.
3663988 3665262 It would take 1,000 ships<br />with more firepower than ...
3667188 3668906 There's another ship coming in.
3669028 3669938 Maybe they know what happened.
3670068 3671217 It's an imperial fighter.
3672828 3673863 It followed us!
3673988 3675899 No. It's a short-range fighter.
3676028 3677939 There aren't any bases around here.<br />Where did it come from?
3681068 3682740 It sure is leaving in a big hurry.
3682868 3683744 If they identify us,<br />we're in big trouble.
3683868 3684778 Not if I can help it.
3684908 3685897 Chewie, jam its transmissions.
3686028 3686858 It would be as well to let it go.
3686988 3687864 It's too far out of range.
3687988 3689137 Not for long.
3691948 3695907 A fighter that size couldn't get<br />this deep into space on its own.
3696028 3698542 He must have gotten lost,<br />been part of a convoy or something.
3698668 3700226 Well, he ain't gonna<br />be around long enough ...
3700348 3701417 to tell anybody about us.
3703828 3705546 Look at him.<br />He's heading for that small moon.
3705668 3708182 I think I can get him before<br />he gets there. He's almost in range.
3709708 3711619 That's no moon.
3711748 3713147 It's a space station.
3713268 3714986 It's too big to be a space station.
3718188 3720497 I have a very bad feeling about this.
3720628 3722300 Turn the ship around.
3722428 3724498 Yeah. I think you're right.<br />Full reverse!
3724628 3726744 Chewie, lock in<br />the auxiliary power.
3730788 3733143 Chewie, lock in<br />the auxiliary power!
3735428 3737066 Why are we still<br />moving towards it?!
3737188 3738906 We're caught in a tractor beam.<br />It's pulling us in!
3739028 3740586 There's got to be<br />something you can do!
3740708 3742027 There's nothing<br />I can do about it, kid.
3742148 3743297 I'm at full power.<br />I'm gonna have to shut down.
3743428 3744861 They're not gonna<br />get me without a fight.
3749228 3750456 You can't win ...
3750588 3752624 but there are alternatives<br />to fighting.
3768548 3770618 Clear Bay 327.
3770748 3772978 We are opening<br />the magnetic field.
3787028 3788177 To your stations!
3788308 3789536 Come with me.
3793308 3794787 ~ Close all outboard shields. ~
3794908 3796785 ~ Close all outboard shields. ~
3798188 3799177 Yes?
3799308 3800661 ~ We've captured a freighter  ... ~
3800788 3802016 ~ entering the remains<br />of the Alderaan system. ~
3802148 3803786 ~ Its markings match<br />those of a ship  ... ~
3803908 3806217 ~ that blasted its way<br />out of Mos Eisley. ~
3806348 3809704 They must be trying to return<br />the stolen plans to the princess.
3809828 3812626 She may yet be of some use to us.
3817188 3820976 ~ Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9.<br />Release charge. ~
3822708 3824664 ~ 316, report to control. ~
3827628 3829505 There's no one on board, sir.
3829628 3832222 According to the log, the crew<br />abandoned ship right after take-off.
3832348 3834145 It must be a decoy, sir.
3834268 3835667 Several of the escape pods<br />have been jettisoned.
3835788 3836618 Did you find any droids?
3836748 3837578 No, sir.
3837708 3839539 If there were any on board,<br />they must also have jettisoned.
3839668 3841101 Send a scanning crew aboard.
3841228 3842946 I want every part<br />of this ship checked.
3843068 3843978 Yes, sir.
3844108 3845427 I sense something ...
3845548 3848381 a presence I've not felt since ...
3850948 3852427 Get me a scanning crew in here<br />on the double.
3852548 3854186 I want every part<br />of this ship checked.
3862908 3864785 There's no one here.
3873188 3874985 Boy, it's lucky you had<br />these compartments.
3875108 3876461 I use them for smuggling.
3876588 3878146 I never thought I'd<br />be smuggling myself in 'em.
3878268 3879542 This is ridiculous.
3879668 3880862 Even if I could take off ...
3880988 3882307 I'd never get past<br />the tractor beam.
3882428 3883781 Leave that to me.
3883908 3886547 Damn fool, I knew<br />that you were gonna say that.
3886668 3887896 Who's the more foolish ...
3888028 3889939 the fool or the fool<br />who follows him?
3890068 3891467 Argh!
3898388 3899707 The ship's all yours.
3899828 3901625 If the scanners pick up anything ...
3901748 3903545 report it immediately.
3903668 3905386 All right, let's go.
3919748 3921067 Hey, down there!
3923028 3924984 Could you give us a hand<br />with this?
3933188 3936021 TK-421, why aren't you<br />at your post?
3936148 3938343 TK-421, do you copy?
3950108 3951860 Take over.<br />We've got a bad transmitter.
3951988 3953740 I'll see what I can do.
3956348 3958179 Grrr!
3969428 3972306 Between his howling and your blasting<br />everything in sight ...
3972428 3974862 it's a wonder the whole station<br />doesn't know we're here.
3974988 3976421 Bring them on!
3976548 3977617 I'd prefer a straight fight<br />to all this sneakin' around.
3977748 3979625 We've found the computer outlet, sir.
3979748 3982387 Plug in. He should be able to interpret<br />the entire imperial network.
3992188 3994748 He says he's found<br />the main controls ...
3994868 3997143 to the power beam that's<br />holding the ship here.
3997268 3999304 He'll try to make the precise location<br />appear on the monitor.
3999428 4001988 The tractor beam is coupled<br />to the main reactor ...
4002108 4003461 in seven locations.
4003588 4005021 A power loss<br />at one of the terminals ...
4005148 4007582 will allow the ship to leave.
4007708 4010427 I don't think you boys can help.
4010548 4012186 I must go alone.
4012308 4013821 Whatever you say.
4013948 4015586 I've done more than I bargained for<br />on this trip already.
4015708 4017107 I want to go with you.
4017228 4019378 Be patient, Luke.<br />Stay and watch over the droids.
4019508 4021021 They must be delivered safely ...
4021148 4024026 or other star systems will suffer<br />the same fate as Alderaan.
4024148 4028027 Your destiny lies along<br />a different path from mine.
4031108 4034737 The Force will be with you always.
4041848 4043804 Argh argh argh!
4043928 4045407 You said it, Chewie.
4045528 4048804 Where did you dig up<br />that old fossil?
4048928 4050725 Ben is a great man.
4050848 4053237 Yeah, great at getting us<br />into trouble.
4053368 4054642 I didn't hear you give any ideas.
4054768 4056042 Well, anything's better<br />than just hangin' around ...
4056168 4057283 waiting for 'em to pick us up.
4057408 4058238 Who do you think ...
4059488 4060807 What is it?
4060928 4062884 I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
4063008 4065238 He says "I've found her"<br />and keeps repeating "She's here."
4065368 4067962 Well, who ... who has he found?
4068088 4068964 Princess Leia.
4069088 4070680 The princess?<br />She's here?!
4070808 4071684 Princess?
4071808 4073002 Where? Where is she?
4073128 4074322 Princess? What's going on?
4078888 4082198 Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.
4086168 4089365 I'm afraid she's scheduled<br />to be terminated.
4089488 4090443 Oh, no!
4090568 4091887 We've got to do something!
4092008 4093487 What are you talking about?
4093608 4094757 The droids belong to her.
4094888 4095718 She's the one in the message.
4095848 4096917 We got to help her.
4097048 4098197 Now look, don't get<br />any funny ideas.
4098328 4099397 The old man wants us<br />to wait right here.
4099528 4100847 But he didn't know<br />she was here.
4100968 4102959 Just find a way back into that<br />detention block.
4103088 4103998 I'm not going anywhere.
4104128 4105163 They're going to execute her.
4105288 4106687 Look, a few minutes ago, you said ...
4106808 4107718 you didn't want to just wait here<br />to be captured.
4107848 4108803 Now all you want to do is stay?
4108928 4110520 Marching into the detention area ...
4110648 4111717 is not what I had in mind.
4111848 4112837 But they're gonna kill her!
4112968 4114526 Better her than me.
4122048 4123242 She's rich.
4123368 4125677 Argh!
4125808 4126923 Rich?
4127048 4128561 Mm-hmm. Rich, powerful.
4128688 4131566 Listen, if you were to rescue her,<br />the reward would be ...
4131688 4132803 What?
4132928 4134281 Well, more well<br />than you can imagine.
4134408 4136683 I don't know.<br />I can imagine quite a bit.
4136808 4137797 You'll get it.
4137928 4138917 I better.
4139048 4140401 You will.
4140528 4141961 All right, kid.<br />You better be right about this.
4142088 4143077 All right.
4143208 4144038 What's your plan?
4144168 4145396 Um ...
4145528 4148918 3PO, hand me those binders there,<br />will you?
4149048 4150925 O.K.
4151048 4153084 Now ... I'm gonna<br />put these on you.
4153208 4154163 Grrr!
4154288 4158042 O.K. Han, you ... you put those on.
4158168 4159203 Don't worry, Chewie.
4159328 4160727 I think I know<br />what he has in mind.
4160848 4163521 Master Luke, sir,<br />pardon me for asking ...
4163648 4166287 but what should R2 and I do<br />if we're discovered here?
4166448 4167847 Lock the door.
4167968 4170084 And hope they don't have blasters.
4170208 4171846 That isn't very reassuring.
4177368 4178357 Grrr!
4191528 4192847 ~ 517 to scanner control. ~
4192968 4196119 ~ 517 to scanner control. ~
4199528 4201484 ~ 316, report to control. ~
4204648 4207082 ~ 53 to upper bay door. ~
4207208 4209722 ~ 53 to upper bay door. ~
4221248 4223398 I can't see a thing<br />in this helmet.
4252408 4254922 This is not gonna work.
4255048 4256117 Why didn't you say so before?
4256248 4258125 I did say so before.
4272568 4275765 Where are you taking this ... thing?
4275888 4278482 Prisoner transfer<br />from Cell Block 1138.
4278608 4280997 I wasn't notified.
4281128 4283164 I'll have to clear it.
4288088 4289237 Argh!
4289368 4290596 Look out! He's loose!
4290728 4291558 He'll tear us all apart!
4291688 4292916 I'll get him!
4315248 4316203 Look out!
4322208 4323038 Arrgh!
4326128 4328483 We gotta find out which cell<br />this princess of yours is in.
4328608 4329927 Here it is ... 2187.
4330048 4332482 You go and get her.<br />I'll hold them here.
4335328 4337603 Uh ... Uh, everything's<br />under control.
4337728 4338877 Situation normal.
4339008 4340157 What happened?
4340288 4342563 Had a slight weapons malfunction ...
4342688 4344804 but, uh, everything's<br />perfectly all right now.
4344928 4347567 We're fine ... We're all fine<br />here now. Thank you.
4347688 4348803 How are you?
4348928 4350725 We're sending a squad up.
4350848 4352167 Uh, negative, negative!
4352288 4354756 We have a ... a reactor leak<br />here, uh, now.
4354888 4355877 Give us a few minutes<br />to lock it down.
4356008 4357760 Uh, large leak, very dangerous.
4357888 4360482 Who is this? What's your<br />operating number?
4360608 4361677 Uh ...
4362848 4363963 Boring conversation anyway.
4364088 4366807 Luke! We're gonna have company!
4379648 4382037 Aren't you a little short<br />for a stormtrooper?
4382168 4382998 Huh?
4383128 4384607 Oh, the uniform.
4386248 4388159 I'm Luke Skywalker.<br />I'm here to rescue you.
4388288 4389641 You're who?
4389768 4390837 I'm here to rescue you.<br />I've got your R2 unit.
4390968 4392003 I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
4392128 4393243 Ben Kenobi?!<br />Where is he?
4393368 4394278 Come on!
4396088 4397362 He is here.
4397488 4399718 Obi-Wan Kenobi?
4399848 4400997 What makes you think so?
4401128 4403562 A tremor in the Force.
4403688 4404757 The last time I felt it ...
4404888 4406924 was in the presence<br />of my old master.
4407048 4409403 Surely he must be dead by now.
4409528 4412247 Don't underestimate the Force.
4412368 4414165 The Jedi are extinct.
4414288 4416404 Their fire has gone out of the universe.
4416528 4419804 You, my friend, are all that's left<br />of their religion.
4419928 4421361 Yes.
4421488 4422443 We have an emergency alert ...
4422568 4425082 in Detention Block AA-23.
4425208 4426277 The princess?
4426408 4427636 Put all sections on alert.
4427768 4429167 Obi-Wan is here.
4429288 4431199 The Force is with him.
4431328 4432317 If you're right ...
4432448 4434245 he must not be<br />allowed to escape.
4434368 4435801 Escape is not his plan.
4435928 4437520 I must face him alone.
4443728 4445798 Argh!
4445928 4447919 Get behind me!<br />Get behind me!
4458888 4459923 Watch your left.
4460048 4461527 They went down the cell bay.
4463968 4465481 Can't get out that way.
4465608 4467121 Looks like you managed to cut off<br />our only escape route.
4467248 4471400 Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,<br />Your Highness.
4471528 4472847 C-3PO, C-3PO!
4472968 4474162 Yes, sir?
4474288 4475926 Are there any other ways<br />out of the cell bay?
4476048 4477686 We've been cut off!
4479808 4481924 What was that?<br />I didn't copy.
4482048 4485245 I said all systems have been alerted<br />to your presence, sir.
4485368 4487086 The main entrance seems<br />to be the only way in or out.
4487208 4490041 All other information<br />on your level is restricted.
4490168 4491601 Open up in there!
4491728 4493480 Open up in there!
4493608 4495200 Oh, no!
4495328 4496807 There isn't any other way out!
4498888 4500606 Argh!
4502208 4504324 I can't hold them off forever!<br />Now what?!
4504448 4506086 This is some rescue!
4506208 4507800 You came in here, and you didn't<br />have a plan for getting out?
4507928 4509805 He's the brains, sweetheart!
4509928 4511043 Well, I didn't ...
4512648 4513603 What the hell are you doing?
4513728 4515958 Somebody has to save our skins.
4518208 4519800 Into the garbage chute, fly boy.
4526408 4528000 - Get in there!<br />- Arrgh!
4528128 4530847 Get in there, you big furry oaf!
4530968 4532083 I don't care what you smell.
4532208 4534881 Get in there, and<br />don't worry about it.
4537448 4538847 Wonderful girl!
4540888 4541764 Either I'm going to kill her ...
4541888 4543958 or I'm beginning to like her.
4545448 4548042 Get in there!
4550888 4552844 Aah!
4554608 4555643 Ah!
4555768 4557201 Argh!
4559008 4561647 The garbage chute was<br />a really wonderful idea.
4561768 4565124 What an incredible smell<br />you've discovered!
4567648 4569798 Let's get out of here.
4569928 4571122 Get away from there.
4571248 4572158 No, wait!
4578648 4579524 Will you forget it?!<br />I already tried it!
4579648 4581081 It's magnetically sealed.
4581208 4583164 Put that thing away!<br />You're gonna get us all killed!
4583288 4585119 Absolutely, Your Worship.
4585248 4587443 Look, I had everything under control<br />till you led us down here!
4587568 4589001 Ya know, it's not<br />gonna take 'em long ...
4589128 4590561 to figure out<br />what happened to us!
4590688 4592485 It could be worse.
4592608 4593518 Woorr!
4596088 4597282 It's worse.
4597408 4598841 There's something alive in here.
4598968 4600287 That's your imagination.
4600408 4603081 Something just moved past my leg.
4604728 4606684 Look! Did you see that?
4606808 4607638 What?
4607768 4609406 Grrr!
4627168 4627998 Woorr!
4628128 4628958 Kid!
4629088 4629918 Luke!
4630048 4631401 Luke!
4631528 4632438 Luke!
4633608 4634677 Luke!
4638248 4639203 Aah!
4639328 4640238 Woorr!
4640368 4643724 Luke! Luke, grab hold of this!
4643848 4646157 Blast it!<br />My gun's jammed.
4646288 4647846 Where?
4647968 4648878 Anywhere!
4656448 4657403 Luke, Luke!
4680168 4681726 Help him!
4681848 4682883 What happened?
4683008 4684043 I don't know.
4684168 4686284 It just let go of me<br />and disappeared.
4692328 4695877 I got a bad feeling about this.
4696008 4698124 Grrr!
4700168 4700998 The walls are moving!
4701128 4702356 Don't just stand there!
4702488 4704843 Try and brace it with something.
4709768 4711645 Grrr!
4711768 4713167 Help me!
4725328 4726317 Wait a minute!
4729008 4730600 3PO!
4730728 4732958 Come in, 3PO!
4733088 4734521 3PO!
4734648 4736400 Where could he be?
4740928 4742805 Take over. See to him.
4745048 4747118 Look, there.
4748448 4749767 They're madmen.
4749888 4751082 They're heading for the prison level.
4751208 4752641 If you hurry, you might catch them.
4752768 4754167 Follow me.
4758128 4760084 You stand guard.
4763808 4765207 Come on.
4768768 4770167 Oh!
4773568 4776799 All this excitement has overrun<br />the circuits in my counterpart here.
4776928 4780204 If you don't mind, I'd like to take him<br />down to maintenance.
4780328 4781727 All right.
4793208 4794038 3PO!
4794168 4795442 Come in, 3PO!
4795568 4796921 3PO!
4797048 4798367 Get on top!
4798488 4799557 I can't.
4799688 4802441 Where could he be?! 3PO!
4802568 4804524 3PO, will you come in!
4804648 4805967 They aren't here.
4806088 4807237 Something must have<br />happened to them.
4807368 4808687 See if they've been captured.
4808808 4809763 Hurry.
4813088 4814601 One thing's for sure ...
4814728 4816081 we're all gonna be a lot thinner.
4818728 4820639 Get on top of it.
4820768 4821803 I'm trying.
4826568 4828320 Thank goodness they haven't found them.
4828448 4829403 Where could they be?
4831848 4833327 "Use the comlink"?
4833448 4836008 Oh, my. I forgot.<br />I turned it off.
4838648 4841116 Are you there, sir?
4841248 4842920 3PO!
4843048 4844037 We've had some problems.
4844168 4845237 Will you shut up<br />and listen to me?!
4845368 4847086 Shut down all<br />the garbage mashers ...
4847208 4848084 on the detention level, will ya?!
4848208 4849766 Do you copy!?
4849888 4853164 Shut down all the garbage mashers<br />on the detention level!
4853288 4855722 Shut down all the garbage mashers<br />on the detention level!
4855848 4857486 No! Shut them all down. Hurry!
4869448 4870324 What?
4870448 4871881 Ha ha!
4873928 4875919 Listen to them.<br />They're dying, R2!
4876048 4877561 Curse my metal body!
4877688 4881397 I wasn't fast enough.<br />It's all my fault! My poor master.
4881528 4883007 We're all right! You did great!
4883128 4885437 Hey! Open the pressure<br />maintenance hatch ...
4885568 4887604 on unit number ...<br />Where are we?
4887728 4890925 3263827!
4933488 4936366 If we can just avoid<br />any more female advice ...
4936488 4938604 we ought to be able<br />to get outta here.
4938728 4940127 Well, let's get moving.
4940248 4941158 Grrr!
4941288 4943085 Where are you going?
4943208 4944197 Aw ...
4944328 4945681 No, wait! They'll hear!
4946888 4948640 Come here, you big coward.
4948768 4949678 Chewie, come here.
4949808 4951082 Listen ...
4951208 4953676 I don't know who you are<br />or where you came from ...
4953808 4956606 but from now on, you do<br />as I tell you, OK?
4956728 4958559 Look, Your Worshipfulness ...
4958688 4960485 let's get one thing straight.
4960608 4963281 I take orders from<br />just one person ... me.
4963408 4965319 It's a wonder you're still alive.
4965448 4968565 Will somebody get this big<br />walking carpet out of my way?
4968688 4971680 No reward is worth this.
4980408 4982478 Give me regular reports, please.
4982608 4983643 Right.
4985768 4987087 Do you know what's going on?
4987208 4988880 Maybe it's another drill.
4992608 4995281 You seen that new VT-16?
4995408 4997638 Yeah. Some of the other guys<br />were telling me about it.
4997768 4999759 They say it's ... it's quite a thing to see ...
4999888 5001879 What was that?
5002008 5003487 Ah, it's nothing. Outgassing.
5003608 5004518 Don't worry about it.
5009848 5010678 There she is.
5010808 5011957 C-3PO? Do you copy?
5012088 5012998 Yes, sir.
5013128 5014959 - Are you safe?<br />- For the moment.
5015088 5017283 We're in the main hangar<br />across from the ship.
5019248 5020761 We're right above you.<br />Stand by.
5020888 5022480 You came in that thing?
5022608 5023597 You're braver than I thought.
5023728 5024956 Nice! Come on.
5028968 5029798 It's them!
5029928 5030838 Blast them!
5031928 5032883 Get back to the ship!
5033008 5034361 Where are you going?<br />Come back!
5034488 5035443 He certainly has courage.
5035568 5036842 What good will it do us ...
5036968 5039038 if he gets himself killed?<br />Come on.
5039168 5042604 Aah!
5044048 5046198 Aah!
5061808 5062877 Whoop!
5063008 5065522 I think we took a wrong turn.
5069648 5070558 There's no lock.
5074448 5075642 That oughta hold them<br />for a while.
5075768 5077167 Quick! We've got to get across.
5077288 5078926 Find the controls<br />that extend the bridge.
5079048 5080367 I think I just blasted it.
5080488 5082206 They're coming through!
5103648 5104603 Here, hold this.
5120808 5121877 Here they come.
5131648 5133366 For luck.
5139008 5141806 We think they may be splitting up.
5141928 5145045 They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.
5158048 5159083 Where could they be?
5163768 5165565 Close the blast doors!
5172648 5174764 Open the blast doors!<br />Open the blast doors!
5192408 5194683 I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
5194808 5196241 We meet again at last.
5196368 5199326 The circle is now complete.
5199448 5201803 When I left you,<br />I was but the learner.
5201928 5203884 Now I am the master.
5204008 5206806 Only a master of evil, Darth.
5225408 5227558 Your powers are weak, old man.
5227688 5229201 You can't win, Darth.
5229328 5231205 If you strike me down ...
5231328 5234525 I shall become more powerful<br />than you can possibly imagine.
5240968 5243607 You should not have come back.
5268328 5270888 Didn't we just leave this party?
5272568 5273557 What kept you?
5273688 5274564 We, uh, ran into some old friends.
5274688 5275677 The ship all right?
5275808 5277446 It seems OK,<br />if we can get to it.
5277568 5279286 I just hope the old man got<br />the tractor beam out of commission.
5293208 5294357 Look!
5297848 5299600 Come on, R2, we're going.
5301408 5302397 Now's our chance! Go!
5306128 5307038 Ben?
5321968 5323606 No!
5331368 5332198 Come on!
5332328 5333397 Come on!
5333528 5334927 Come on!
5335048 5336117 Luke, it's too late!
5336248 5337920 Blast the door, kid!
5347288 5349438 • Run, Luke, run! •
5351488 5354207 I hope that old man got that<br />tractor beam out of commission ...
5354328 5356796 or this is gonna be a real short trip.<br />O.K. Hit it!
5366848 5368645 Aargh!
5386128 5388198 We're coming up<br />on their sentry ships.
5388328 5389920 Hold them off.
5390048 5393563 Angle the deflector shields<br />while I charge up the main guns.
5400848 5403203 I can't believe he's gone.
5405768 5408123 There wasn't anything<br />you could have done.
5408248 5411001 Come on, buddy.<br />We're not out of this yet.
5426528 5429406 You in, kid?<br />OK, stay sharp.
5439848 5440917 Here they come.
5458208 5459960 They're coming in too fast!
5467648 5469047 We've lost the lateral controls!
5469168 5471318 Don't worry.<br />She'll hold together.
5472808 5474685 Hear me, baby?<br />Hold together.
5491048 5491958 Ha ha!
5495968 5497447 Got him! I got him!
5497568 5499718 Great, kid!<br />Don't get cocky.
5501088 5502646 There's still two more<br />of them out there!
5535168 5536521 That's it! We did it!
5536648 5538684 We did it!
5538808 5541163 Help! I think I'm melting!<br />This is all your fault!
5548808 5550127 Are they away?
5550248 5553160 They've just made the jump<br />into hyperspace.
5553288 5557440 You're sure the homing beacon<br />is secure aboard their ship?
5557568 5560128 I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.
5560248 5561920 This had better work.
5562128 5564688 Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?
5564808 5567766 You know, sometimes<br />I amaze even myself.
5567888 5570038 That doesn't sound too hard.
5570168 5571396 They let us go.
5571528 5572722 It's the only explanation ...
5572848 5574327 for the ease of our escape.
5574448 5575483 Easy? You call that easy?
5575608 5576518 They're tracking us.
5576648 5578240 Not this ship, sister.
5578368 5581883 At least the information<br />in R2 is still intact.
5582008 5583566 What's so important?<br />What's he carrying?
5583688 5586441 The technical readouts<br />of that battle station.
5586568 5589002 I only hope that<br />when the data's analyzed ...
5589128 5590641 a weakness can be found.
5590768 5592201 It's not over yet.
5592328 5593966 It is for me, sister.
5594088 5595726 Look, I ain't in this<br />for your revolution ...
5595848 5597600 and I'm not in it for you, Princess.
5597728 5598877 I expect to be well paid.
5599008 5600123 I'm in it for the money.
5600248 5602125 You needn't worry<br />about your reward.
5602248 5603761 If money is all that you love ...
5603888 5606243 then that's what you'll receive.
5608208 5610039 Your friend is quite a mercenary.
5610168 5612284 I wonder if he really cares<br />about anything ...
5612408 5613841 or anybody.
5613968 5615367 I care.
5621648 5624037 So ...
5624168 5625601 what do you think of her, Han?
5625728 5627480 I'm trying not to, kid.
5627608 5629564 Good.
5632808 5635641 Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
5637688 5639007 I don't know.<br />What do you think?
5639128 5640561 You think a princess<br />and a guy like me ...
5640688 5642360 No!
5686728 5687638 You're safe.
5687768 5688962 When we heard about Alderaan ...
5689088 5690203 we feared the worst.
5690328 5691920 We have no time<br />for sorrows, Commander.
5692048 5693766 You must use the information<br />in this R2 unit ...
5693888 5694764 to help plan the attack.
5694888 5696287 It's our only hope.
5717208 5718402 Yes.
5718528 5719881 We're approaching the planet Yavin.
5720008 5721805 The rebel base is on a moon<br />on the far side.
5721928 5724362 We are preparing<br />to orbit the planet.
5732688 5734644 The battle station<br />is heavily shielded ...
5734768 5736486 and carries a firepower ...
5736608 5738439 greater than half the starfleet.
5738568 5742686 Its defenses are designed around<br />a direct large-scale assault.
5742808 5747836 A small, one-man fighter should be able<br />to penetrate the outer defense.
5747968 5750084 Pardon me for asking, sir ...
5750208 5752961 but what good are snub fighters<br />going to be against that?
5753088 5756444 The Empire doesn't consider<br />a small, one-man fighter ...
5756568 5757523 to be any threat ...
5757648 5760287 or they'd have a tighter defense.
5760408 5763320 An analysis of the plans<br />provided by Princess Leia ...
5763448 5766565 has demonstrated a weakness<br />in the battle station.
5766688 5769282 The approach will not be easy.
5769408 5772400 You're required to maneuver<br />straight down this trench ...
5772528 5775725 and skim the surface<br />to this point.
5775848 5778442 The target area<br />is only 2 meters wide.
5778568 5780604 It's a small thermal exhaust port ...
5780728 5783117 right below the main port.
5783248 5786240 The shaft leads directly<br />to the reactor system.
5786368 5788882 A precise hit will start<br />a chain reaction ...
5789008 5791124 which should destroy the station.
5791248 5794684 Only a precise hit will<br />set up a chain reaction.
5794808 5796036 The shaft is ray-shielded ...
5796168 5797806 so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
5797928 5800283 That's impossible,<br />even for a computer.
5800408 5803684 It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye<br />womp rats in my T-16 back home.
5803808 5806083 They're not much bigger<br />than 2 meters.
5806208 5809439 Then man your ships,<br />and may the Force be with you.
5817168 5819523 ~ Orbiting the planet<br />at maximum velocity. ~
5819648 5821479 ~ The moon with the rebel base  ... ~
5821608 5823803 ~ will be in range in 30 minutes. ~
5823928 5826123 This will be a day long remembered.
5826248 5828557 It has seen the end of Kenobi ...
5828688 5833045 and will soon see the end<br />of the rebellion.
5836448 5839645 All flight crews, man your stations.
5839768 5842521 All flight crews, man your stations.
5844848 5847806 So ... you got your reward<br />and you're just leaving, then?
5847928 5849327 That's right. Yeah.
5849448 5852997 I got some old debts I got<br />to pay off with this stuff.
5853128 5854766 And even if I didn't ...
5854888 5857402 you don't think I'd be fool enough<br />to stick around here, do ya?
5857528 5859086 Why don't you come with us?
5859208 5860960 You're pretty good in a fight.<br />We could use ya.
5861088 5863841 Come on. Why don't you<br />take a look around?
5863968 5865196 You know what's about to happen ...
5865328 5866556 what they're up against.
5866688 5867803 They could use<br />a good pilot like you.
5867928 5869327 You're turning<br />your back on them.
5869448 5871723 What good's a reward<br />if you ain't around to use it?
5871848 5873645 Besides, attacking<br />that battle station ...
5873768 5874757 ain't my idea of courage.
5874888 5877561 It's more like ... suicide.
5878888 5879764 All right.
5879888 5882038 Take care of yourself, Han.
5882168 5884602 I guess that's what<br />you're best at, isn't it?
5884728 5886002 Hey, Luke.
5889168 5891477 May the Force be with you.
5894328 5895238 Argh!
5895368 5897563 Argh!
5897688 5898916 What are you looking at?
5899048 5900766 I know what I'm doing.
5905008 5908284 All pilots to your stations.
5908408 5910285 All pilots to your stations.
5915328 5916681 What's wrong?
5916808 5918241 Oh, it's Han.
5918368 5920484 I don't know.<br />I really thought he'd change his mind.
5920608 5922121 He's got to follow his own path.
5922248 5924000 No one can choose it for him.
5924128 5928041 I only wish Ben were here.
5935088 5936965 Open main launch tubes.
5938008 5939805 Main launch tubes opening, sir.
5940008 5940884 Hey, Luke!
5941008 5941997 Biggs!
5942128 5943766 I don't believe it.<br />How are you?
5943888 5944718 Great.
5944848 5945803 Hey, coming up?
5945928 5947122 I'll be right up there with you ...
5947248 5948840 and have I got stories to tell you.
5948968 5952085 Are you sure<br />you can handle this ship?
5952208 5954768 Sir, Luke is<br />the best bush pilot ...
5954888 5956446 in the outer-rim territories.
5956568 5957603 You'll do all right.
5957728 5958956 Thank you, sir. I'll try.
5959088 5960601 I gotta get aboard.
5960728 5961877 We'll hear all your stories when<br />we get back, all right?
5962008 5962884 All right.
5963008 5963997 Hey, Biggs.
5964128 5965447 I told you I'd make it someday.
5965568 5966398 It'll be like old times, Luke.
5966528 5968166 They'll never stop us.
5971208 5972846 Hey, this R2 unit of yours<br />seems a bit beat up.
5972968 5973957 You want a new one?
5974088 5975646 Not on your life.
5975768 5977087 That little droid and I have<br />been through a lot together.
5977208 5978118 You OK, R2?
5979808 5982003 Good.
5982128 5985279 Gold squadron,<br />begin take-off procedure.
5985408 5987876 Hang on tight, R2.<br />You've got to come back.
5990088 5991999 You wouldn't want my life<br />to get boring, would you?
6038408 6042401 • Luke, the Force will be with you. •

6090168 6091965 We're passing through<br />the magnetic field.
6092088 6093203 Hold tight.
6093328 6096320 Switch your deflectors on.<br />Double front.
6099208 6100880 Look at the size of that thing!
6101008 6103476 Cut the chatter, Red Two.<br />Accelerate to attack speed.
6106768 6107723 This is it, boys.
6107848 6109361 Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
6109488 6110603 I copy, Gold Leader.
6110728 6112161 We're starting for<br />the target shaft now.
6112288 6113243 We're in position.
6113368 6114403 I'm going to cut across the axis ...
6114528 6115643 and try and draw their fire.
6129488 6131046 Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.
6131168 6132601 I see it. Stay low.
6139768 6141201 This is Red Five. I'm going in.
6145528 6146563 Luke, pull up!
6148208 6149197 Are you all right?
6149328 6150397 I got a little cooked, but I'm O.K.
6156088 6157646 We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader ...
6157768 6158723 but they're so small ...
6158848 6159963 they're evading our turbolasers.
6160088 6161840 We'll have to destroy<br />them ship to ship.
6161968 6163879 Get the crews to their fighters.
6166408 6168478 Watch yourself.<br />There's a lot of fire coming ...
6168608 6170405 from the right side<br />of that deflection tower.
6170528 6171483 I'm on it.
6171608 6173439 I'm going in.<br />Cover me, Porkins.
6173568 6174762 I'm right with you,<br />Red Three.
6180928 6182122 I've got a problem here.
6182248 6183044 Eject.
6183168 6184044 I can hold it.
6184168 6184998 Pull up!
6185128 6187722 No, I'm all ... Aah!
6190128 6192119 ~ The rebel base<br />will be in firing range ... ~
6192248 6193681 ~ in seven minutes. ~
6196648 6199367 • Luke, trust your feelings. •
6206848 6210682 Squad leaders, we've<br />picked up a new group of signals.
6210808 6212366 Enemy fighters coming your way.
6212488 6214080 My scope's negative.<br />I don't see anything.
6214208 6215277 Pick up your visual scanning.
6215408 6216318 Here they come.
6219448 6221086 Watch it. You've got one<br />on your tail.
6226248 6227158 I'm hit!
6228488 6229523 You've picked one up!<br />Watch it!
6229648 6230922 I can't see it!
6232808 6234446 He's on me tight.<br />I can't shake him!
6236128 6237038 I'll be right there.
6248728 6250525 Several fighters have broken off ...
6250648 6253003 from the main group.<br />Come with me.
6255848 6258237 Fall in! Fall in!
6258368 6259278 Watch your back, Luke.
6259408 6260318 Watch your back.
6260448 6261642 Fighters above you, coming in.
6267728 6268763 I'm hit, but not bad.
6268888 6270207 R2, see what you can do with it.
6270328 6272398 Hang on back there.
6272528 6274962 Red Six, can you see Red Five?
6275088 6276521 There's a heavy fire zone.
6276648 6277444 Red Five, where are you?
6277568 6278921 I can't shake him!
6282848 6284247 I'm on him, Luke. Hold on.
6287368 6288926 Blast it, Biggs! Where are you?
6295688 6296677 Thanks, Wedge.
6296808 6298958 Good shooting,<br />Wedge. Red Leader ...
6299088 6300203 this is Gold Leader.
6300328 6301397 We're starting our attack run.
6303168 6305523 I copy, Gold Leader.<br />Move into position.
6307768 6309918 Stay in attack formation.
6310048 6312801 The exhaust port<br />is marked and locked in.
6318408 6319557 Switch all power ...
6319688 6322043 to front deflector screen.
6322168 6323567 Switch all power ...
6323688 6325519 to front deflector screen.
6329128 6330766 How many guns do you think,<br />Gold Five?
6330888 6332003 Say about 20 guns ...
6332128 6333959 some on the surface,<br />some on the towers.
6334088 6336807 ~ Death Star will be in range<br />in five minutes. ~
6338848 6341726 Switch to targeting computer.
6344128 6346039 Computer locked. Getting a signal.
6348008 6350363 The guns! They've stopped!
6352008 6353327 Stabilize your rear deflectors.
6353448 6355086 Watch for enemy fighters.
6355208 6356880 They're coming in!<br />Three marks at 210.
6358808 6360844 I'll take them myself.<br />Cover me.
6360968 6362196 Yes, sir.
6376168 6377157 It's no good.<br />I can't maneuver.
6377288 6378277 Stay on target.
6378408 6379238 We're too close.
6379368 6380357 Stay on target.
6382088 6382998 Loosen up!
6385968 6388607 Gold Five to Red Leader,<br />lost Tiree, lost Hutch.
6388728 6389922 I copy, Gold Leader.
6390048 6390958 They came from behind.
6395488 6397285 We've analyzed their attack, sir ...
6397408 6399683 and there is a danger.
6399808 6402117 Should I have your<br />ship standing by?
6402248 6405001 Evacuate in our moment of triumph?
6405128 6406766 I think you overestimate<br />their chances.
6406888 6409448 ~ Rebel base, three minutes<br />and closing. ~
6409568 6411923 Red boys, this is Red Leader.
6412048 6413367 Rendezvous at mark 6.1.
6413488 6415558 This is Red Two flying toward you.
6415688 6417485 Red Three standing by.
6417608 6419087 Red Leader, this is Base One.
6419208 6420607 Keep half your group<br />out of range ...
6420728 6421956 for the next run.
6422088 6424363 Copy, Base One. Luke,<br />take Red Two and Three.
6424488 6427639 Hold up here and wait for<br />my signal to start your run.
6435168 6436886 This is it!
6441288 6443279 We should be able to see it by now.
6444928 6446600 Keep your eyes open<br />for those fighters.
6448248 6449476 There's too much interference.
6449608 6450643 Red Five, can you see them<br />from where you are?
6450768 6452565 No sign of any ...<br />Wait. Coming in.35.
6452688 6453598 I see them.
6455088 6456123 I'm in range.
6457368 6458278 Target's coming up.
6461488 6463524 Just hold them off<br />for a few seconds.
6463648 6465843 Close up formation.
6467168 6469238 Almost there.
6477968 6479799 You'd better let her loose.<br />They're right behind me.
6480008 6481077 Almost there.
6482448 6484006 I can't hold them.
6485248 6486840 Aah!
6491928 6493327 It's away!
6497008 6498441 It's a hit!
6498568 6500524 Negative, negative.<br />It didn't go in.
6500648 6503162 It just impacted on the surface.
6509448 6510961 Red Leader, we're right above you.
6511088 6513283 Turn to .05.<br />We'll cover for you.
6513408 6516718 Stay there. I just lost<br />my starboard engine.
6516848 6518998 Get set up for your attack run.
6523448 6525006 Aah!
6531288 6534280 ~ Rebel base,<br />one minute and closing. ~
6534408 6536524 Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.
6536648 6538366 We're going in full throttle.
6538488 6539807 That ought to keep those<br />fighters off our back.
6540008 6541919 Right with you, boss.
6542048 6544198 Luke, at that speed, will you be able<br />to pull out in time?
6544328 6546239 It'll be just like<br />Beggars Canyon back home.
6553288 6555404 We'll stay back<br />far enough to cover you.
6555528 6556517 My scope shows the tower ...
6556648 6557967 but I can't see the exhaust port.
6558088 6559487 Are you sure<br />the computer can hit it?
6562808 6564719 Watch yourself.<br />Increase speed, full throttle.
6564848 6566042 What about that tower?
6566168 6567237 You worry about those fighters!
6567368 6568483 I'll worry about the tower!
6573888 6576721 R2, that stabilizer's<br />broken loose again.
6576848 6578076 See if you can't lock it down.
6586448 6588564 Fighters coming in.3.
6596288 6598597 I'm hit!<br />I can't stay with you!
6598728 6600958 Get clear, Wedge.<br />You can't do any more good back there.
6601088 6601998 Sorry.
6603208 6604880 Let him go.<br />Stay on the leader.
6607768 6609167 Hurry, Luke. They're coming in<br />much faster this time.
6609288 6610403 We can't hold them.
6613888 6615162 R2, try and increase the power.
6621648 6622763 Hurry up, Luke!
6622888 6624321 Quick! Quick!
6631568 6633957 ~ Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing. ~
6634088 6635123 I'm on the leader.
6638488 6639807 Hang on, R2.
6654728 6656923 • Use the Force, Luke. •
6659688 6661599 • Let go, Luke. •
6663648 6665843 The Force is strong with this one.
6665968 6667481 • Luke, trust me. •
6672808 6674082 His computer's off.
6674208 6676005 Luke, you switched off<br />your targeting computer!
6676128 6677641 What's wrong?
6677768 6679326 Nothing. I'm all right.
6691728 6692877 I've lost R2!
6694408 6697127 ~ The Death Star<br />has cleared the planet. ~
6697248 6699921 ~ The Death Star<br />has cleared the planet. ~
6700048 6701606 ~ Rebel base in range. ~
6701728 6704083 You may fire when ready.
6704208 6706324 ~ Commence primary ignition. ~
6718928 6720486 I have you now.
6722728 6723763 What?
6723888 6724798 Yahoo!
6726568 6727842 Look out!
6733728 6736401 You're all clear, kid!<br />Now let's blow this thing and go home!
6742968 6744321 ~ Stand by. ~
6747248 6748647 ~ Stand by. ~
6758848 6759678 Great shot, kid!
6759808 6761878 That was one in a million!
6762008 6766320 • Remember, the Force<br />will be with you — always. •
6784008 6785407 Luke!
6789208 6790527 Hey! Hey!
6790648 6792320 I knew you'd come back.<br />I just knew it.
6792448 6793676 Well, I wasn't going to let you<br />get all the credit ...
6793808 6795036 and take all the reward.
6795168 6797602 Hey, I knew there was<br />more to you than money.
6797728 6798843 Oh, no!
6798968 6801277 Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?
6801408 6804639 Say something.<br />You can repair him, can't you?
6804768 6806486 We'll get to work<br />on him right away.
6806608 6807882 You must repair him.
6808008 6809805 Sir, if any of my circuits<br />or gears will help ...
6809928 6810758 I'll gladly donate them.
6810888 6811957 He'll be all right.
6845048 6846527 Argh!
6906488 6908956 Argh!
6915488 6918207 Argh!
