20400 25200 A long time ago in a galaxy far,<br />far awayâ€¦.
27640 34160 STAR<br />WARS
38680 45600 Episode IV<br />A NEW HOPE
46920 50640 It is a period of civil war.
50720 54920 Rebel spaceships, striking<br />from a hidden base, have won
55000 60160 their first victory against<br />the evil Galactic Empire.
60240 65280 During the battle, Rebel<br />spies managed to steal secret
65360 69440 plans to the Empire's<br />ultimate weapon, the DEATH
69520 72960 STAR, an armored space<br />station with enough power to
73040 76040 destroy an entire planet.
76120 79280 Pursued by the Empire's<br />sinister agents, Princess
79360 83920 Leia races home aboard her<br />starship, custodian of the
84000 87360 stolen plans that can save<br />her people and restore
87440 93720 freedom to the galaxy....
166640 168480 Did you hear that?
168560 171840 They shut down the main reactor.<br />We'll be destroyed for sure.
171920 173040 This is madness.
183520 185320 We're doomed.
187040 189120 There'll be no escape<br />for the princess this time.
192240 193720 What's that?
296400 298880 R2-D2, where are you?
315240 317800 At last. Where have you been?
317920 321040 They're heading in this direction.<br />What are we going to do?
321120 325640 We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines<br />or smashed into who knows what.
325760 328320 Wait a minute. Where are you going?
340760 343360 The Death Star plans<br />are not in the main computer.
343880 346080 Where are those transmissions<br />you intercepted?
346600 349200 What have you done with those plans?
349280 351680 We intercepted no transmissions.
352080 356200 This is a consular ship.<br />We're on a diplomatic mission.
356280 360640 If this is a consular ship,<br />where is the ambassador?
364280 367760 Commander, tear this ship apart<br />until you've found those plans!
367840 370640 And bring me the passengers!<br />I want them alive!
383360 384800 There's one. Set for stun.
390640 391960 She'll be all right.
392040 394160 Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
395680 398440 Hey. You're not permitted in there.<br />It's restricted.
398520 400160 You'll be deactivated for sure.
402280 404960 Don't call me a mindless philosopher,<br />you overweight glob of grease.
405040 406560 Come out, before somebody sees you.
409000 411240 Secret mission? What plans?
411320 413920 What are you talking about?<br />I'm not getting in there.
417160 418480 I'm going to regret this.
426680 430080 -There goes another one.<br />-Hold your fire. There's no life-forms.
430160 431480 It must have short-circuited.
431560 435520 That's funny. The damage<br />doesn't look as bad from out here.
437160 439160 Are you sure this thing is safe?
458080 460680 Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.
460760 463000 The Imperial Senate<br />will not sit still for this.
463080 464400 When they hear<br />you've attacked a diplomatic...
464480 466560 Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.
466640 468880 You weren't on<br />any mercy mission this time.
468960 472720 Several transmissions were beamed<br />to this ship by rebel spies.
472800 475800 I want to know what happened<br />to the plans they sent you.
475880 477720 I don't know what you're talking about.
477800 480880 I'm a member of the Imperial Senate<br />on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.
480960 483840 You are part of the Rebel Alliance<br />and a traitor.
484400 486400 Take her away!
490120 491520 Holding her is dangerous.
491600 495160 If word of this gets out, it could generate<br />sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.
495240 497920 I have traced the rebel spies to her.
498000 500760 Now she is my only link<br />to finding their secret base.
500840 502560 She'll die before she'll tell you anything.
502640 504320 Leave that to me.
504400 507920 Send a distress signal, and then inform<br />the senate that all aboard were killed.
508000 511200 Lord Vader, the battle station plans<br />are not aboard this ship
511280 512760 and no transmissions were made.
513200 515400 An escape pod was jettisoned<br />during the fighting,
515480 516880 but no life-forms were aboard.
517600 520080 She must have hidden<br />the plans in the escape pod.
520200 521760 Send a detachment<br />down to retrieve them.
521840 523800 See to it personally, Commander.
523880 525800 There'll be no one to stop us this time.
525920 527480 Yes, sir.
542120 544120 How did we get into this mess?
544200 546640 I really don't know how.
547160 551120 We seem to be made to suffer.<br />It's our lot in life.
553200 557440 I've got to rest before I fall apart.<br />My joints are almost frozen.
563720 565880 What a desolate place this is.
570520 572160 Where do you think you're going?
572240 573680 Well, I'm not going that way.
574440 576440 It's much too rocky.
576520 578440 This way is much easier.
578520 580960 What makes you think<br />there are settlements over there?
582920 584440 Don't get technical with me.
585720 587840 What mission?<br />What are you talking about?
590000 592920 I've just about had enough of you.
593000 594240 Go that way.
594360 598000 You'll be malfunctioning within a day,<br />you nearsighted scrap pile.
598080 600000 And don't let me catch you<br />following me, begging for help
600080 602000 because you won't get it.
616000 617520 No more adventures.
617600 619680 I'm not going that way.
653680 656680 That malfunctioning little twerp.<br />This is all his fault.
657680 659800 He tricked me into going this way,
659880 661800 but he'll do no better.
665400 667280 Wait. What's that?
667360 670200 A transport. I'm saved.
670280 672000 Over here!
672080 674680 Hey! Hey!
674760 678240 Help! Please help!
889280 890280 R2?
893920 897760 R2-D2, it is you! It is you!
931280 935280 Someone was in the pod.<br />The tracks go off in this direction.
935360 937280 Look, sir. Droids.
952040 953280 We stopped.
953360 955120 Wake up. Wake up!
962040 963680 We're doomed.
971960 972960 Do you think they'll melt us down?
986800 989000 Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
989080 991200 Will this never end?
1030560 1033400 -Fine. Let's go.<br />-Luke!
1033480 1035000 Luke!
1038520 1043560 Luke, tell your uncle if he gets<br />a translator, be sure it speaks Bocce.
1043640 1046080 Doesn't look like we have much choice,<br />but I'll remind him.
1057200 1059400 Yeah, we'll take that red one.
1059480 1061440 No, not that one.
1063240 1066280 You. I suppose you're programmed<br />for etiquette and protocol.
1066360 1070320 Protocol? It's my primary function, sir.<br />I am well-versed in all the customs...
1070400 1073760 -I have no need for a protocol droid.<br />-Of course you haven't, sir.
1073880 1076560 Not in an environment such as this.<br />That's why I have been programmed...
1076640 1080680 I need a droid who understands the<br />binary language of moisture vaporators.
1080760 1084080 Vaporators? Sir, my first job<br />was programming binary load lifters,
1084160 1086280 very similar to your vaporators<br />in most respects.
1086360 1090000 -Can you speak Bocce?<br />-Of course. It's like a second language.
1090080 1092240 -All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.<br />-Shutting up, sir.
1092320 1093520 Luke!
1095800 1098640 Take these two to the garage.<br />I want them cleaned up before dinner.
1098720 1101640 But I was going into Tosche Station<br />to pick up some power converters.
1101720 1103960 You can waste time with your friends<br />when your chores are done.
1104080 1105800 Now come on. Get to it.
1107680 1108960 All right. Come on.
1111640 1114080 And the red one. Come on.
1114800 1116800 Come on, red. Let's go.
1136440 1138440 -Uncle Owen.<br />-Yeah?
1138520 1141240 This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.
1141600 1143680 Hey, what are you trying to push on us?
1146680 1151640 Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit<br />is in prime condition, a real bargain.
1151720 1154320 Uncle Owen, what about that one?
1154400 1157760 What about that blue one?<br />We'll take that one.
1157880 1158880 Take this away.
1158960 1160480 You'll be pleased with that one, sir.
1160560 1164000 He really is in first-class condition.<br />I've worked with him before.
1164080 1165520 Here he comes.
1168800 1170520 Okay. Let's go.
1170600 1172040 Don't you forget this.
1172120 1175640 Why I should stick my neck out for you<br />is quite beyond my capacity.
1181800 1185120 Thank the maker.<br />This oil bath is going to feel so good.
1186560 1190200 I've got such a bad case of<br />dust contamination, I can barely move.
1190280 1191840 It just isn't fair.
1191920 1195080 Biggs is right.<br />I'm never gonna get out of here.
1195160 1197360 Is there anything I might do to help?
1197440 1200880 No, not unless you can alter time,<br />speed up the harvest,
1200960 1202400 or teleport me off this rock.
1202480 1204040 I don't think so, sir.
1204120 1207200 I'm only a droid and not very<br />knowledgeable about such things.
1207280 1209200 Not on this planet, anyway.
1209280 1212720 As a matter of fact,<br />I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
1212800 1214880 Well, if there's a bright center<br />to the universe,
1214960 1217200 you're on the planet<br />that it's farthest from.
1217280 1219720 I see, sir.
1219800 1222640 -You can call me Luke.<br />-I see, Sir Luke.
1223760 1225240 Just Luke.
1225880 1229120 And I am C-3PO,<br />human-cyborg relations.
1229200 1231800 And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.
1231880 1233200 Hello.
1234520 1236520 You got a lot of carbon scoring here.
1236600 1238160 Looks like you boys<br />have seen a lot of action.
1238240 1239400 With all we've been through,
1239480 1241680 sometimes I'm amazed<br />we're in as good condition as we are,
1241760 1243440 what with the rebellion and all.
1243520 1245320 You know of the rebellion<br />against the Empire?
1245400 1246800 That's how we came to be<br />in your service,
1246880 1249000 if you take my meaning, sir.
1249080 1251440 -Have you been in many battles?<br />-Several, I think.
1251520 1253440 There's not much to tell.
1253560 1257160 I'm not much more than an interpreter<br />and not very good at telling stories.
1257240 1260360 Well, not at making them<br />interesting, anyway.
1260440 1262360 Well, my little friend,
1262440 1264520 you got something jammed<br />in here real good.
1264600 1266080 Were you on a Starcruiser or...
1266920 1270000 <i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i><br /><i>You're my only hope.</i>
1270080 1271800 What's this?
1271880 1274960 "What is what"?<br />He asked you a question. What is that?
1275080 1279040 <i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i><br /><i>You're my only hope.</i>
1282400 1286320 <i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i><br /><i>You're my only hope.</i>
1288840 1290840 He says it's nothing, sir,<br />merely a malfunction.
1290920 1293000 Old data. Pay it no mind.
1293080 1295520 Who is she? She's beautiful.
1295600 1298960 I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
1299040 1301280 I think she was a passenger<br />on our last voyage.
1301360 1303520 A person of some importance, I believe.
1303600 1305800 -Our captain was...<br />-Is there any more to this recording?
1307960 1311160 Behave yourself, R2.<br />You're going to get us into trouble.
1311240 1314000 It's all right. You can trust him.<br />He's our new master.
1314120 1315720 <i>You're my only hope.</i>
1317120 1320200 He says he's the property<br />of Obi-Wan Kenobi,
1320280 1321760 a resident of these parts,
1321880 1323560 and it's a private message for him.
1323640 1325760 Frankly, I don't know<br />what he's talking about.
1325840 1327840 Our last master was Captain Antilles.
1327920 1332480 But with all we've been through,<br />this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
1333040 1335960 Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br />I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.
1336040 1338600 I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know<br />what he's talking about?
1338680 1341120 I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan,
1341880 1344040 but old Ben lives out<br />beyond the Dune Sea.
1344120 1345960 He's kind of a strange old hermit.
1347120 1349120 I wonder who she is.
1349240 1352280 Sounds like she's in trouble.<br />I better play back the whole thing.
1355760 1359200 He says the restraining bolt has<br />short-circuited his recording system.
1359600 1361640 He suggests that if you remove the bolt,
1361720 1364640 he might be able to play back<br />the entire recording.
1364720 1367080 Oh, yeah. Well...
1367160 1370720 I guess you're too small<br />to run away on me if I take this off.
1370800 1371960 Okay.
1374720 1376320 There you go.
1378000 1381600 Where'd she go? Bring her back.<br />Play back the entire message.
1381680 1382640 "What message"?
1383440 1384880 The one you've just been playing.
1384960 1387080 The one you're carrying<br />inside your rusty innards.
1387160 1389560 Luke! Luke!
1389640 1391840 I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
1391920 1395120 I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have<br />picked up a slight flutter.
1395200 1398640 Here. See what you can do with him.<br />I'll be right back.
1401280 1404120 Just you reconsider<br />playing that message for him.
1405280 1407640 No, I don't think he likes you at all.
1407760 1410000 No, I don't like you either.
1418840 1421600 I think that R2 unit<br />might have been stolen.
1421680 1422800 What makes you think that?
1422880 1425480 I stumbled across a recording<br />while I was cleaning him.
1425560 1428320 He says he belongs to someone<br />called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1430880 1434240 I thought he might have meant old Ben.<br />Do you know what he's talking about?
1436960 1438520 I wonder if he's related to Ben.
1438600 1440400 That wizard's just a crazy old man.
1442000 1443640 Tomorrow, take that R2 unit<br />to Anchorhead
1443720 1445360 and have its memory erased.
1445440 1447600 That'll be the end of it.<br />It belongs to us now.
1449360 1452400 But what if this Obi-Wan<br />comes looking for him?
1452480 1454240 He won't.
1454320 1456320 I don't think he exists anymore.
1456400 1458160 He died about the same time<br />as your father.
1458600 1461280 -He knew my father?<br />-I told you to forget it.
1462400 1466000 Your only concern is to prepare<br />those new droids for tomorrow.
1466080 1467680 In the morning,<br />I want them on the south ridge,
1467760 1469840 working on those condensers.
1469920 1471400 Yes, sir.
1472760 1475320 I think those new droids<br />are gonna work out fine.
1475400 1478960 In fact, I was also thinking<br />about our agreement,
1479040 1480800 about me staying on another season.
1483200 1486520 If these new droids work out,<br />I want to apply to the academy this year.
1487440 1489400 You mean the next semester<br />before the harvest?
1489480 1491400 Sure. There's more than enough droids.
1491480 1493520 Harvest is when I need you the most.
1493600 1495560 It's only one season more.
1495680 1498840 This year we'll make enough<br />on the harvest to hire more hands
1498920 1501200 and then you can go<br />to the academy next year.
1502160 1504160 You must understand<br />I need you here, Luke.
1504240 1507200 -But it's a whole 'nother year.<br />-It's only one more season.
1507280 1509360 That's what you said<br />when Biggs and Tank left.
1509440 1511880 -Where are you going?<br />-Looks like I'm going nowhere.
1511960 1513880 I have to go finish<br />cleaning those droids.
1513960 1517560 Owen, he can't stay here forever.<br />Most of his friends have gone.
1517640 1519880 It means so much to him.
1519960 1522480 I'll make it up to him next year.<br />I promise.
1524160 1528160 Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.<br />He has too much of his father in him.
1528600 1530400 That's what I'm afraid of.
1579600 1582760 -What are you doing hiding back there?<br />-It wasn't my fault, sir.
1582840 1584640 Please don't deactivate me.
1584720 1587440 I told him not to go,<br />but he's faulty, malfunctioning.
1587560 1590760 -Kept babbling on about his mission.<br />-Oh, no.
1599200 1601600 That R2 unit has<br />always been a problem.
1602000 1604280 These astro droids<br />are getting quite out of hand.
1604360 1606560 Even I can't understand<br />their logic at times.
1606640 1609360 How could I be so stupid?<br />He's nowhere in sight.
1609840 1610880 Blast it!
1610960 1613200 Pardon me, sir,<br />but couldn't we go after him?
1613280 1614800 It's too dangerous<br />with the Sandpeople around.
1614880 1616440 We'll have to wait till morning.
1616520 1618520 Luke, I'm shutting the power down.
1618600 1621160 I'll be there in a few minutes.
1621240 1623640 Boy, am I gonna get it.
1623720 1625840 That little droid's gonna cause me<br />a lot of trouble.
1625920 1627880 He excels at that, sir.
1628960 1630480 Come on.
1650560 1652480 Have you seen Luke this morning?
1652560 1656000 He said he had things to do before<br />he started today, so he left early.
1656080 1659760 -Did he take those new droids with him?<br />-I think so.
1659840 1662640 He better have those units in<br />the south range repaired by midday
1662760 1664400 or there'll be hell to pay.
1665400 1668000 There's a droid on the scanner.<br />Dead ahead.
1668080 1671080 It might be our little R2 unit.<br />Hit the accelerator.
1693920 1696400 Where do you think you're going?
1696480 1698400 Master Luke is your rightful owner now.
1698480 1701440 We'll have no more<br />of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.
1702720 1704360 Don't talk to me of your mission either.
1704440 1707520 You're fortunate he doesn't blast you<br />into a million pieces right here.
1707640 1710480 No. It's all right,<br />but I think we'd better go.
1711120 1712320 What's wrong with him now?
1713160 1715560 There are several creatures<br />approaching from the southeast.
1716120 1718600 Sandpeople. Or worse.
1719960 1721600 Come on. Let's go have a look.
1721680 1722760 Come on.
1725480 1729280 Well, there are two Banthas down there,<br />but I don't see any...
1729360 1731160 Wait a second.
1731240 1733640 They're Sandpeople, all right.<br />I can see one of them now.
1808720 1809880 Hello there.
1812560 1816240 Come here, my little friend.<br />Don't be afraid.
1818440 1820080 Don't worry. He'll be all right.
1826240 1828800 Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day.
1829600 1832480 You're fortunate to be all in one piece.
1835800 1838080 Ben? Ben Kenobi?
1838160 1840160 Boy, am I glad to see you.
1840240 1843280 The Jundland Wastes<br />are not to be traveled lightly.
1846480 1850640 Tell me, young Luke,<br />what brings you out this far?
1850720 1852240 This little droid.
1854360 1856000 I think he's searching<br />for his former master,
1856080 1858240 but I've never seen<br />such devotion in a droid before.
1860200 1863320 He claims to be the property<br />of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
1863400 1866000 Is he a relative of yours?<br />Do you know who he's talking about?
1867520 1869160 Obi-Wan Kenobi?
1871600 1873520 Obi-Wan.
1874000 1878200 Now, that's a name<br />I've not heard in a long time.
1878800 1880640 A long time.
1881800 1884720 I think my uncle knows him.<br />He said he was dead.
1884800 1886680 He's not dead.
1886760 1887840 Not yet.
1888240 1891480 -You know him?<br />-Of course I know him.
1891560 1892880 He's me.
1895040 1898360 I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan
1898440 1901080 since before you were born.
1901160 1902800 Then the droid does belong to you.
1903200 1905520 I don't seem to remember<br />ever owning a droid.
1907760 1909520 Very interesting.
1910880 1913400 I think we better get indoors.
1913480 1916200 The Sandpeople are easily startled,
1916280 1919080 but they'll soon be back,<br />and in greater numbers.
1922040 1923360 3PO.
1932720 1935400 Where am I?<br />I must have taken a bad step.
1937360 1940120 Can you stand? We've gotta get out<br />of here before the Sandpeople return.
1940200 1942960 I don't think I can make it.<br />You go on, Master Luke.
1943040 1947120 There's no sense in you risking yourself<br />on my account. I'm done for.
1948080 1950040 No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?
1950120 1952040 Quickly. They're on the move.
1957280 1960720 My father didn't fight in the wars.<br />He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
1960800 1964560 That's what your uncle told you.<br />He didn't hold with your father's ideals.
1964640 1967720 Thought he should have stayed here<br />and not gotten involved.
1968440 1970800 -You fought in the Clone Wars?<br />-Yes.
1971280 1974920 I was once a Jedi knight,<br />the same as your father.
1977320 1978680 I wish I'd known him.
1978760 1981480 He was the best starpilot in the galaxy
1982560 1984440 and a cunning warrior.
1984520 1987400 I understand you've become<br />quite a good pilot yourself.
1989280 1991600 And he was a good friend.
1992280 1993360 Which reminds me...
1994440 1996440 I have something here for you.
1998560 2001160 Your father wanted you to have this<br />when you were old enough,
2001680 2003800 but your uncle wouldn't allow it.
2004760 2006920 He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan
2007000 2010480 on some damn-fool idealistic crusade,<br />like your father did.
2010920 2013480 Sir, if you'll not be needing me,<br />I'll close down for a while.
2013560 2015120 Sure. Go ahead.
2017800 2021200 -What is it?<br />-Your father's lightsaber.
2022000 2023600 This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.
2024640 2027800 Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.
2028480 2030800 An elegant weapon
2030880 2033840 for a more civilized age.
2035680 2038120 For over a thousand generations,<br />the Jedi knights
2038200 2042240 were the guardians of<br />peace and justice in the old Republic
2042760 2045160 before the dark times,
2045240 2046840 before the Empire.
2050000 2051720 How did my father die?
2054160 2056760 A young Jedi named Darth Vader,
2056840 2059360 who was a pupil of mine<br />until he turned to evil
2060200 2063520 helped the Empire hunt down<br />and destroy the Jedi knights.
2065320 2067720 He betrayed and murdered your father.
2069480 2071840 Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
2073040 2076800 Vader was seduced<br />by the dark side of the Force.
2077560 2079680 The Force?
2079760 2082800 The Force is<br />what gives a Jedi his power.
2082880 2085400 It's an energy field<br />created by all living things.
2085520 2088080 It surrounds us and penetrates us.
2088160 2090240 It binds the galaxy together.
2097200 2099840 Let's see if we can't figure out<br />what you are, my little friend,
2101040 2103200 and where you come from.
2103280 2106440 -I saw part of a message...<br />-I seem to have found it.
2106520 2110880 <i>General Kenobi, years ago you served</i><br /><i>my father in the Clone Wars.</i>
2111240 2114400 <i>Now he begs you to help him</i><br /><i>in his struggle against the Empire.</i>
2114480 2117840 <i>I regret that I am unable to present</i><br /><i>my father's request in person.</i>
2117920 2119560 <i>But my ship has fallen under attack</i>
2119680 2122040 <i>and I'm afraid my mission</i><br /><i>to bring you to Alderaan has failed.</i>
2122120 2125520 <i>I have placed information</i><br /><i>vital to the survival of the rebellion</i>
2125600 2127800 <i>into the memory systems</i><br /><i>of this R2 unit.</i>
2127880 2129440 <i>My father will know how to retrieve it.</i>
2130200 2133960 <i>You must see this droid</i><br /><i>safely delivered to him on Alderaan.</i>
2134040 2135720 <i>This is our most desperate hour.</i>
2136480 2139800 <i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i><br /><i>You're my only hope.</i>
2154800 2158920 You must learn the ways of the Force<br />if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
2159680 2161040 Alderaan?
2161120 2162360 I'm not going to Alderaan.
2162440 2164840 I've gotta get home.<br />It's late. I'm in for it as it is.
2164920 2167360 I need your help, Luke.<br />She needs your help.
2167880 2170560 I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
2175160 2178520 I can't get involved. I've got work to do.
2179360 2181200 It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it.
2181320 2183840 But there's nothing<br />I can do about it right now.
2185360 2189120 -It's all such a long way from here.<br />-That's your uncle talking.
2189200 2192880 Oh, boy. My uncle.<br />How am I ever gonna explain this?
2192960 2194680 Learn about the Force, Luke.
2201800 2204560 I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
2204640 2208000 You can get a transport there<br />to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
2209280 2212280 You must do what you feel<br />is right, of course.
2219880 2223520 Until this battle station is fully<br />operational, we are vulnerable.
2223600 2226040 The Rebel Alliance<br />is too well equipped.
2226160 2227800 They're more dangerous<br />than you realize.
2227880 2230720 Dangerous to your starfleet,<br />Commander,
2230800 2232600 not to this battle station.
2232680 2236240 The rebellion will continue to<br />gain support in the Imperial Senate...
2236320 2240680 The Imperial Senate will no longer<br />be of any concern to us.
2240800 2244920 I've just received word that the emperor<br />has dissolved the council permanently.
2245000 2249040 The last remnants of the old Republic<br />have been swept away.
2249120 2250760 That's impossible.
2250840 2253520 How will the emperor maintain control<br />without the bureaucracy?
2253600 2258400 The regional governors now have<br />direct control over their territories.
2258480 2262240 Fear will keep the local systems in line.
2262320 2264440 Fear of this battle station.
2264520 2265640 And what of the rebellion?
2265720 2268920 If the rebels have obtained a complete<br />technical readout of this station,
2269000 2270960 it is possible, however unlikely,
2271040 2273200 that they might find a weakness<br />and exploit it.
2273760 2277560 The plans you refer to<br />will soon be back in our hands.
2277640 2281920 Any attack by the rebels against this<br />station would be a useless gesture,
2282000 2284080 no matter what technical data<br />they've obtained.
2284160 2287800 This station is now<br />the ultimate power in the universe.
2288440 2290160 I suggest we use it.
2290240 2294480 Don't be too proud of this<br />technological terror you've constructed.
2294560 2297960 The ability to destroy a planet<br />is insignificant
2298040 2299920 next to the power of the Force.
2300000 2303480 Don't try to frighten us with<br />your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
2303560 2306440 Your sad devotion<br />to that ancient religion
2306520 2309040 has not helped you conjure up<br />the stolen data tapes
2309600 2312560 or given you clairvoyance enough<br />to find the rebels' hidden fortress...
2320200 2322800 I find your lack of faith disturbing.
2324280 2326920 Enough of this. Vader, release him.
2327000 2328440 As you wish.
2330840 2332800 This bickering is pointless.
2333920 2337680 Lord Vader will provide us with<br />the location of the rebel fortress
2337760 2340400 by the time this station is operational.
2340480 2344520 We will then crush the rebellion<br />with one swift stroke.
2351440 2355200 It looks like the Sandpeople did this.<br />There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.
2355280 2357600 I've just never heard of them<br />hitting anything this big before.
2357680 2361040 They didn't, but we are<br />meant to think they did.
2361120 2363040 These tracks are side-by-side.
2363120 2367280 Sandpeople always ride single file<br />to hide their numbers.
2367360 2370240 These are the same Jawas<br />that sold us R2 and 3PO.
2370320 2375120 And these blast points,<br />too accurate for Sandpeople.
2375200 2379120 Only imperial stormtroopers<br />are so precise.
2379200 2381800 But why would imperial troops<br />want to slaughter Jawas?
2387160 2388560 If they traced the robots here,
2388640 2389920 they may have learned<br />who they sold them to
2390000 2392440 and that would lead them back home.
2392520 2393680 Wait, Luke.
2393760 2395760 It's too dangerous.
2419800 2421720 Uncle Owen.
2421800 2423680 Aunt Beru.
2423760 2425080 Uncle Owen.
2475360 2480920 Now, Your Highness, we will discuss<br />the location of your hidden rebel base.
2523920 2526240 There's nothing you could have done,<br />had you been there.
2527120 2529080 You'd have been killed too,
2529160 2531920 and the droids would now be<br />in the hands of the Empire.
2533600 2536280 I want to come with you to Alderaan.
2536360 2538400 There's nothing for me here now.
2538480 2541440 I want to learn the ways of the Force<br />and become a Jedi like my father.
2557200 2559600 Mos Eisley spaceport.
2559680 2565280 You will never find a more wretched<br />hive of scum and villainy.
2565360 2566840 We must be cautious.
2608200 2610160 How long have you had these droids?
2610240 2613360 -Three or four seasons.<br />-They're up for sale if you want them.
2614000 2615400 Let me see your identification.
2616040 2619040 You don't need to see his identification.
2619120 2621240 We don't need to see his identification.
2621320 2624160 These aren't the droids<br />you're looking for.
2624240 2625920 These aren't the droids<br />we're looking for.
2627040 2629440 He can go about his business.
2629520 2632720 -You can go about your business.<br />-Move along.
2633040 2635680 Move along. Move along.
2651720 2654920 I can't abide those Jawas.<br />Disgusting creatures.
2655920 2657840 Go on, go on.
2659200 2661040 I can't understand<br />how we got by those troops.
2661120 2662440 I thought we were dead.
2662520 2666880 The Force can have a strong influence<br />on the weak-minded.
2670240 2673480 You really think we're gonna find<br />a pilot here to take us to Alderaan?
2673560 2676320 Most of the best freighter pilots<br />are to be found here.
2676440 2680240 Only watch your step,<br />this place can be a little rough.
2680320 2682000 I'm ready for anything.
2685800 2687720 Come along, R2.
2737840 2741400 -Hey. We don't serve their kind here.<br />-What?
2741480 2744480 Your droids, they'll have to wait outside.<br />We don't want them here.
2745040 2746960 Wait out by the speeder.<br />We don't want any trouble.
2747040 2749000 I heartily agree with you, sir.
2758640 2760120 I'll have one of those.
2796040 2798920 -He doesn't like you.<br />-I'm sorry.
2800040 2803680 I don't like you either.<br />You just watch yourself.
2803760 2808360 We're wanted men. I have the<br />death sentence on 12 systems.
2808440 2811240 -I'll be careful then.<br />-You'll be dead!
2811320 2813280 This little one's not worth the effort.
2814440 2815600 Come, let me get you something.
2843200 2844960 I'm all right.
2846520 2851120 Chewbacca here is first mate<br />on a ship that might suit us.
2855520 2857560 I don't like the look of this.
2872360 2875960 Han Solo. I'm captain<br />of the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>
2876040 2879280 Chewie here tells me you're looking<br />for passage to the Alderaan system.
2879360 2881800 Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.
2881880 2886120 Fast ship? You've never heard of<br />the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>
2886240 2887320 Should I have?
2887400 2890560 It's the ship that made the Kessel run<br />in less than 12 parsecs.
2892600 2894800 I've outrun imperial starships.
2894880 2896880 Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.
2896960 2899160 I'm talking about<br />the big Corellian ships now.
2901000 2904000 She's fast enough for you, old man.
2904080 2907000 -What's the cargo?<br />-Only passengers.
2907080 2909880 Myself, the boy, two droids...
2911000 2912960 And no questions asked.
2914400 2916120 Is it some kind of local trouble?
2916480 2921320 Let's just say we'd like to avoid<br />any imperial entanglements.
2922760 2926000 Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?
2926080 2927680 And it's gonna cost you<br />something extra.
2929400 2931200 Ten thousand, all in advance.
2932840 2934200 Ten thousand?
2935520 2936920 We could almost<br />buy our own ship for that.
2938200 2940400 But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?
2940480 2942560 You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot.
2942640 2945160 We don't have to sit here and listen...
2945720 2948040 We can pay you 2,000 now,
2948120 2951360 plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.
2952320 2953520 Seventeen?
2957000 2959360 Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.
2959440 2962240 We'll leave as soon as you're ready.<br />Docking Bay 94.
2962320 2963880 Ninety-four.
2964720 2968840 Looks like somebody's beginning<br />to take an interest in your handiwork.
2970080 2971920 All right. We'll check it out.
2983720 2987360 Seventeen thousand. Those guys<br />must really be desperate.
2987440 2991840 This could really save my neck.<br />Get back to the ship, get it ready.
2991920 2994120 -You'll have to sell your speeder.<br />-That's okay.
2994200 2996920 I'm never coming back<br />to this planet again.
2997520 2999400 Going somewhere, Solo?
2999480 3002760 Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,<br />I was just going to see your boss.
3002840 3005040 Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
3005120 3006840 It's too late.
3006920 3009720 You should have paid him<br />when you had the chance.
3009800 3012520 Jabba's put a price<br />on your head so large
3012600 3015280 every bounty hunter in the galaxy<br />will be looking for you.
3016280 3018240 I'm lucky I found you first.
3018320 3020600 Yeah, but this time I've got the money.
3020680 3024160 If you give it to me,<br />I might forget I found you.
3024680 3027600 I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...
3027680 3029160 Jabba's through with you.
3030520 3032840 He has no time for smugglers
3032920 3035560 who drop their shipments<br />at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
3035680 3039600 Even I get boarded sometimes.<br />Do you think I had a choice?
3039680 3043680 You can tell that to Jabba.<br />He may only take your ship.
3044480 3045920 Over my dead body.
3046000 3047200 That's the idea.
3047280 3051280 I've been looking forward<br />to this for a long time.
3051400 3052680 I'll bet you have.
3066680 3068760 Sorry about the mess.
3077680 3080880 Her resistance to the mind probe<br />is considerable.
3080960 3084280 It'll be some time before we can<br />extract any information from her.
3084360 3087960 The final checkout is completed.<br />All systems are operational.
3088040 3090280 What course shall we set?
3090400 3094120 Perhaps she would respond<br />to an alternative form of persuasion.
3094200 3095520 What do you mean?
3095600 3098560 I think it is time we demonstrated<br />the full power of this station.
3098640 3101120 -Set your course for Alderaan.<br />-With pleasure.
3102280 3104320 Lock the door, R2.
3106400 3108400 Check this side of the street.
3112560 3115240 The door's locked.<br />Move on to the next one.
3122080 3124760 I would much rather have gone with<br />Master Luke than stay here with you.
3125520 3129080 I don't know what this trouble is about,<br />but I'm sure it must be your fault.
3129600 3131240 You watch your language.
3133760 3136680 All right. Give it to me. I'll take it.
3136760 3140360 Look at this. Ever since the XP-38<br />came out, they just aren't in demand.
3140440 3142440 It'll be enough.
3160800 3165080 Solo! Come out of there, Solo!
3165160 3167160 Right here, Jabba.
3168560 3169960 I've been waitin' for you.
3170400 3173000 Have you now.
3173880 3176600 You didn't think I was gonna run,<br />did you?
3176680 3181120 Han, my boy, you disappoint me.
3181200 3183320 Why haven't you paid me
3183400 3186800 and why did you fry poor Greedo?
3186880 3189640 Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me,<br />come see me yourself.
3189720 3191240 Don't send one of these twerps.
3191320 3194800 Han, I can't make exceptions.
3194880 3197760 What if everyone who smuggled for me
3197880 3200480 dropped their cargo at the first sign
3200560 3203240 of an imperial starship?
3203320 3205400 It's not good business.
3205480 3208920 Look, Jabba,<br />even I get boarded sometimes.
3209760 3212280 You think I had a choice?
3212360 3214280 But I got a nice, easy charter.
3214400 3218440 I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.<br />I just need a little more time.
3218520 3224080 Han, my boy, you're the best.
3224160 3226600 So, for an extra twenty percent...
3226680 3228840 Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.
3228920 3230840 Okay, fifteen percent.
3230920 3233120 But if you fail me again,
3233200 3236120 I'll put a price on your head so big
3236200 3240440 you won't be able to<br />go near a civilized system.
3240520 3243280 Jabba, you're a<br />wonderful human being.
3244760 3245920 Come on!
3252200 3255880 If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,<br />we ought to do well.
3279560 3281240 What a piece of junk.
3281320 3283840 She'll make .5 past light speed.
3283920 3286720 She may not look like much,<br />but she's got it where it counts, kid.
3286800 3289760 I've made a lot of special<br />modifications myself.
3289840 3293760 But we're a little rushed, so if you'll<br />just get on board, we'll get outta here.
3298920 3300440 Hello, sir.
3308920 3310160 Which way?
3312000 3314000 All right, men, load your weapons.
3316280 3318240 Stop that ship. Blast them.
3328040 3330040 Chewie, get us out of here!
3331440 3335040 Oh, my. I'd forgotten<br />how much I hate space travel.
3354000 3355280 Looks like an imperial cruiser.
3355360 3357080 Our passengers<br />are hotter than I thought.
3357160 3358760 Hold 'em off. Angle the deflector shields
3358840 3360760 while I make the calculations<br />for the jump to light speed.
3371520 3374400 Stay sharp. There's two more comin' in.<br />They're gonna try and cut us off.
3374480 3376600 Why don't you outrun 'em?<br />You said this thing was fast.
3376680 3378600 Watch your mouth or you're gonna<br />find yourself floating home.
3379200 3382040 We'll be safe enough<br />once we make the jump to hyperspace.
3382120 3384000 Besides, I know a few maneuvers.<br />We'll lose 'em.
3388960 3390160 Here's where the fun begins.
3390280 3392040 How long before you can<br />jump to light speed?
3392680 3395040 It'll take a few moments to get<br />the coordinates from the navicomputer.
3395120 3396720 Are you kidding?<br />At the rate they're gaining?
3397240 3399800 Traveling through hyperspace<br />ain't like dustin' crops, boy.
3399920 3402400 Without precise calculations,<br />we'd fly right through a star
3402480 3406400 or bounce too close to a supernova,<br />and that would end your trip real quick.
3406480 3408640 -What's that flashing?<br />-We're losing a deflector shield.
3408720 3411680 Go strap yourselves in.<br />I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.
3433120 3435800 We've entered the Alderaan system.
3435880 3437240 Governor Tarkin.
3437320 3439920 I should have expected<br />to find you holding Vader's leash.
3440280 3443640 I recognized your foul stench<br />when I was brought on board.
3445240 3447120 Charming to the last.
3447960 3449760 You don't know how hard I found it
3449880 3451760 signing the order to terminate your life.
3451840 3454800 I'm surprised you had the courage<br />to take the responsibility yourself.
3455160 3457960 Princess Leia, before your execution,
3458040 3460480 I would like you to be my guest<br />at a ceremony
3460560 3463520 that will make<br />this battle station operational.
3463600 3466840 No star system will dare<br />oppose the emperor now.
3466920 3469200 The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin,
3469280 3471880 the more star systems<br />will slip through your fingers.
3471960 3475280 Not after we demonstrate<br />the power of this station.
3475360 3478800 In a way, you have determined<br />the choice of the planet
3478880 3481040 that'll be destroyed first.
3481120 3485640 Since you are reluctant to provide us<br />with the location of the rebel base,
3485720 3488520 I have chosen to test<br />this station's destructive power
3488600 3491600 on your home planet of Alderaan.
3491680 3494360 No. Alderaan is peaceful.<br />We have no weapons.
3494440 3496880 You would prefer another target?<br />A military target?
3496960 3499120 Then name the system.
3501080 3504480 I grow tired of asking this,<br />so it will be the last time.
3505200 3507160 Where is the rebel base?
3511280 3512840 Dantooine.
3513720 3514840 They're on Dantooine.
3514920 3518360 There. You see, Lord Vader?<br />She can be reasonable.
3518440 3521200 Continue with the operation.<br />You may fire when ready.
3521280 3523520 -What?<br />-You're far too trusting.
3523840 3526440 Dantooine is too remote<br />to make an effective demonstration.
3526520 3530560 But don't worry. We will deal with<br />your rebel friends soon enough.
3533840 3535200 Commence primary ignition.
3558520 3561040 Are you all right? What's wrong?
3562080 3564560 I felt a great disturbance in the Force
3564640 3567720 as if millions of voices suddenly<br />cried out in terror
3567800 3570200 and were suddenly silenced.
3570280 3572360 I fear something terrible has happened.
3574040 3576280 You'd better get on with your exercises.
3579080 3581680 You can forget your troubles<br />with those imperial slugs.
3581760 3584160 I told you I'd outrun them.
3587720 3589440 Don't everybody thank me at once.
3590240 3593680 Anyway, we should be at Alderaan<br />about 0200 hours.
3601480 3603480 Now be careful, R2.
3612800 3615440 He made a fair move.<br />Screaming about it can't help you.
3615520 3617800 Let him have it.<br />It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
3617880 3620160 But, sir, nobody worries<br />about upsetting a droid.
3620520 3622760 That's 'cause a droid<br />don't pull people's arms
3622840 3624840 out of their sockets when they lose.
3625280 3627520 Wookiees are known to do that.
3629440 3631080 I see your point, sir.
3631160 3634400 I suggest a new strategy, R2.<br />Let the Wookiee win.
3652880 3656520 Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force<br />flowing through him.
3657280 3659600 -You mean it controls your actions?<br />-Partially.
3659680 3661600 But it also obeys your commands.
3667080 3668840 Hokey religions and ancient weapons
3668920 3671120 are no match<br />for a blaster at your side, kid.
3672040 3673520 You don't believe in the Force, do you?
3674560 3677040 Kid, I've flown from one side<br />of this galaxy to the other.
3677120 3678720 I've seen a lot of strange stuff,
3678800 3681040 but I've never seen anything<br />to make me believe
3681120 3684560 there's one all-powerful force<br />controlling everything.
3685120 3688800 There's no mystical energy field<br />controls my destiny.
3688880 3691840 It's all a lot of<br />simple tricks and nonsense.
3691920 3694800 I suggest you try it again, Luke.
3696360 3699040 This time, let go your conscious self
3701080 3703320 and act on instinct.
3704320 3707840 With the blast shield down, I can't see.<br />How am I supposed to fight?
3707920 3710080 Your eyes can deceive you.<br />Don't trust them.
3719920 3721880 Stretch out with your feelings.
3736520 3738480 You see? You can do it.
3739120 3740280 I call it luck.
3740360 3742960 In my experience,<br />there's no such thing as luck.
3743480 3745600 Good against remotes is one thing.
3745720 3748880 Good against the living,<br />that's something else.
3749880 3751520 We're coming up on Alderaan.
3755000 3757800 I did feel something.<br />I could almost see the remote.
3757880 3762640 That's good. You've taken<br />your first step into a larger world.
3767320 3769120 Yes?
3769200 3770920 Our scout ships<br />have reached Dantooine.
3771040 3772880 They found the remains of a rebel base,
3772960 3775400 but they estimate that<br />it has been deserted for some time.
3775480 3779160 They are now conducting an extensive<br />search of the surrounding systems.
3779840 3782400 She lied. She lied to us.
3782480 3786160 I told you she would never<br />consciously betray the rebellion.
3787680 3789840 Terminate her immediately.
3792680 3795200 Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.<br />Cut in the sublight engines.
3798000 3799160 What the...
3802760 3804520 We've come out of hyperspace<br />into a meteor shower,
3804600 3806000 some kind of asteroid collision.
3806360 3808480 -It's not on any of the charts.<br />-What's going on?
3808560 3810840 Our position's correct,<br />except no Alderaan.
3811280 3813360 -Where is it?<br />-That's what I'm trying to tell you.
3813440 3815160 It ain't there. It's been blown away.
3815240 3817920 -What? How?<br />-Destroyed by the Empire.
3818040 3820200 The entire starfleet<br />couldn't destroy the whole planet.
3820280 3823240 It'd take a thousand ships<br />with more firepower than I've...
3824360 3826720 -There's another ship coming in.<br />-Maybe they know what happened.
3826800 3828120 It's an imperial fighter.
3830160 3833080 -It followed us.<br />-No. It's a short-range fighter.
3833160 3834960 There aren't any bases around here.<br />Where did it come from?
3838200 3840960 Sure is leaving in a hurry.<br />If they identify us, we're in trouble.
3841040 3843200 Not if I can help it.<br />Chewie, jam its transmissions.
3843280 3846720 -Let it go. It's too far out of range.<br />-Not for long.
3850480 3853800 A fighter that size couldn't get<br />this deep into space on its own.
3853880 3856760 He must have gotten lost,<br />been part of a convoy or something.
3856840 3859400 He ain't gonna be around<br />long enough to tell anybody about us.
3862040 3863880 He's heading for that small moon.
3863960 3866520 I can get him before he gets there.<br />He's almost in range.
3868080 3870160 That's no moon.
3870240 3873600 -It's a space station.<br />-It's too big to be a space station.
3876960 3879440 I have a very bad feeling about this.
3879520 3881360 Turn the ship around.
3881440 3884000 Yeah. I think you're right. Full reverse.
3884080 3885760 Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
3890600 3892760 Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
3895120 3896680 Why are we still moving towards it?
3896760 3898600 We're caught in a tractor beam.<br />It's pulling us in.
3898680 3900240 There's gotta be something you can do.
3900320 3903200 There's nothing I can do.<br />I'm at full power. I have to shut down.
3903280 3904800 They're not gonna<br />get me without a fight.
3909440 3912880 You can't win,<br />but there are alternatives to fighting.
3929520 3931640 <i>Clear Bay 327.</i>
3931720 3934080 <i>We are opening the magnetic field.</i>
3948720 3951040 To your stations. Come with me.
3955480 3959120 <i>Close all outboard shields.</i><br /><i>Close all outboard shields.</i>
3960480 3961520 Yes?
3961600 3964600 <i>We've captured a freighter entering</i><br /><i>the remains of the Alderaan system.</i>
3964680 3968640 <i>Its markings match those of a ship</i><br /><i>that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.</i>
3968720 3972440 They must be trying to return<br />the stolen plans to the princess.
3972520 3975520 She may yet be of some use to us.
3980440 3984400 <i>Unlock one, five, seven and nine.</i><br /><i>Release charge.</i>
3991920 3993080 There's no one on board, sir.
3993160 3995920 According to the log, the crew<br />abandoned ship right after takeoff.
3996640 3999680 It must be a decoy. Several escape<br />pods have been jettisoned.
3999760 4001640 -Did you find any droids?<br />-No, sir.
4001720 4003600 If there were any,<br />they must also have jettisoned.
4003680 4007200 Send a scanning crew aboard.<br />I want every part of this ship checked.
4007280 4008440 Yes, sir.
4008520 4010080 I sense something,
4010160 4013000 a presence I've not felt since...
4015400 4018800 Get me a scanning crew in here.<br />I want every part of this ship checked.
4027560 4029560 There's no one here.
4038800 4040800 Boy, it's lucky you have<br />these compartments.
4040880 4043960 I use them for smuggling. I never<br />thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.
4044040 4045240 This is ridiculous.
4045320 4048080 Even if I could take off,<br />I'd never get past the tractor beam.
4048160 4049280 Leave that to me.
4049360 4052600 Damn fool.<br />I knew you were gonna say that.
4052680 4056320 Who's the more foolish,<br />the fool or the fool who follows him?
4065600 4070160 The ship's all yours. If the scanners<br />pick up anything, report it immediately.
4071040 4073000 All right. Let's go.
4087240 4089240 Hey, down there.
4091000 4093000 Could you give us a hand with this?
4101400 4104640 TK-421, why aren't you at your post?
4104720 4106720 TK-421, do you copy?
4119160 4122360 Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.<br />I'll see what I can do.
4139720 4141720 Between his howling<br />and your blasting everything,
4141800 4144080 it's a wonder the whole station<br />doesn't know we're here.
4144160 4147480 Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight<br />to sneakin' around.
4147560 4149320 We've found the computer outlet, sir.
4149400 4152440 Plug in. He should be able to<br />interpret the entire imperial network.
4163840 4167200 He's found the controls to the power<br />beam that's holding the ship here.
4167280 4169880 He'll try to make the precise location<br />appear on the monitor.
4170560 4174480 The tractor beam is coupled<br />to the main reactor in seven locations.
4174560 4177880 A power loss at one of the terminals<br />will allow the ship to leave.
4180320 4183560 I don't think you boys can help.<br />I must go alone.
4183640 4187160 Whatever you say. I've done more than<br />I bargained for on this trip already.
4187240 4191280 -I want to go with you.<br />-Be patient, Luke. Watch the droids.
4191360 4192760 They must be delivered safely
4192880 4196560 or other star systems will suffer<br />the same fate as Alderaan.
4196640 4199960 Your destiny lies along<br />a different path from mine.
4203600 4205400 The Force will be with you...
4205800 4207200 Always.
4216320 4218640 You said it, Chewie.
4218720 4221120 Where did you dig up that old fossil?
4222400 4223880 Ben is a great man.
4223960 4227040 -Great at getting us into trouble.<br />-I didn't hear you give any ideas.
4227160 4230000 Anything's better than just hangin'<br />around waiting for 'em to pick us up.
4230080 4231600 Who do you think...
4232440 4235680 -What is it?<br />-I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
4235760 4238640 He says, "I've found her,"<br />and keeps repeating, "She's here."
4238720 4241240 Who? Who has he found?
4241320 4243960 -Princess Leia.<br />-The princess? She's here?
4244040 4245720 -Princess?<br />-Where is she?
4245800 4247720 Princess? What's going on?
4253120 4255920 Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.
4260720 4263400 I'm afraid she's scheduled<br />to be terminated.
4263480 4266480 Oh, no. We've gotta do something.
4266560 4269040 -What are you talking about?<br />-The droids belong to her.
4269160 4271040 She's the one in the message.<br />We gotta help her.
4271160 4274040 Don't get any funny ideas.<br />The old man wants us to wait here.
4274120 4277400 He didn't know she was here.<br />Find a way into that detention block.
4277480 4280360 -I'm not going anywhere.<br />-They're gonna execute her.
4280440 4283840 You said you didn't want to just wait<br />to be captured. Now you want to stay?
4283920 4286760 Marching into the detention area<br />is not what I had in mind.
4286840 4289680 -But they're gonna kill her.<br />-Better her than me.
4297600 4298760 She's rich.
4301920 4303400 Rich?
4303480 4307760 Rich, powerful. If you were to<br />rescue her, the reward would be...
4307840 4310400 -What?<br />-Well, more well than you can imagine.
4310480 4312600 I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit.
4312680 4314600 -You'll get it.<br />-I better.
4314680 4316440 You will.
4316520 4318760 All right, kid.<br />You better be right about this.
4318880 4320800 -All right.<br />-What's your plan?
4321840 4324320 3PO, hand me those binders there,<br />will you?
4325880 4327280 Okay.
4327960 4329960 Now, I'm gonna put these on you.
4331360 4334600 Okay, Han, you put those on.
4335400 4337800 Don't worry, Chewie.<br />I think I know what he has in mind.
4338840 4340680 Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking,
4340760 4343600 but what should R2 and I do<br />if we're discovered here?
4344360 4347640 -Lock the door.<br />-And hope they don't have blasters.
4347720 4349720 That isn't very reassuring.
4370000 4374640 <i>517 to scan control.</i><br /><i>517 to scan control.</i>
4401200 4403520 I can't see a thing in this helmet.
4434760 4437520 -This is not gonna work.<br />-Why didn't you say so before?
4437600 4439560 I did say so before.
4454520 4457800 Where are you taking this thing?
4457880 4460640 Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.
4461920 4463880 I wasn't notified.
4463960 4465920 I'll have to clear it.
4472440 4474960 -Look out! He's loose!<br />-He'll tear us all apart!
4499280 4500280 Look out.
4510480 4512960 We gotta find out which cell<br />this princess of yours is in.
4513040 4515280 Here it is. 2187. You go and get her.
4515360 4517320 I'll hold them here.
4521640 4523840 Everything's under control.<br />Situation normal.
4523920 4525040 <i>What happened?</i>
4525120 4527160 Had a slight weapons malfunction,
4527240 4529640 but everything's perfectly all right now.
4529720 4532960 We're fine. We're all fine here now.<br />Thank you.
4533040 4535680 -How are you?<br /><i>-We're sending a squad up.</i>
4536640 4540040 Negative, negative.<br />We have a reactor leak here now.
4540120 4543880 Give us a few minutes to lock it down.<br />Large leak, very dangerous.
4543960 4547040 <i>Who is this?</i><br /><i>What's your operating number?</i>
4548920 4552640 Boring conversation anyway.<br />Luke, we're gonna have company!
4566680 4568640 Aren't you a little short<br />for a stormtrooper?
4569760 4571280 Oh, the uniform.
4573160 4575160 I'm Luke Skywalker.<br />I'm here to rescue you.
4575240 4576240 You're who?
4576320 4578080 I'm here to rescue you.<br />I've got your R2 unit.
4578160 4580160 -I'm here with Ben Kenobi.<br />-Ben Kenobi? Where is he?
4580240 4581480 Come on.
4583280 4587160 -He is here.<br />-Obi-Wan Kenobi?
4587240 4590600 -What makes you think so?<br />-A tremor in the Force.
4590680 4594680 The last time I felt it<br />was in the presence of my old master.
4594760 4597080 Surely he must be dead by now.
4597200 4599960 Don't underestimate the Force.
4600600 4604680 The Jedi are extinct.<br />Their fire has gone out of the universe.
4604760 4608080 You, my friend, are all that's left<br />of their religion.
4608160 4609360 Yes.
4609440 4612960 <i>We have an emergency alert</i><br /><i>in Detention Block AA-23.</i>
4613680 4616360 The princess? Put all sections on alert.
4616440 4619960 Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.
4620040 4622880 If you're right,<br />he must not be allowed to escape.
4622960 4626480 Escape is not his plan.<br />I must face him alone.
4635960 4637560 Get behind me. Get behind me.
4649120 4651440 Watch your left.<br />They went down the cell bay.
4654480 4657400 -Can't get out that way.<br />-You cut off our only escape route.
4657480 4660480 Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,<br />Your Highness.
4662520 4664760 -C-3PO. C-3PO.<br /><i>-Yes, sir?</i>
4664840 4668320 Are there any other ways out of<br />the cell bay? We've been cut off.
4670760 4672840 What was that? I didn't copy.
4672920 4676320 I said all systems have been<br />alerted to your presence, sir.
4676400 4678920 The main entrance<br />seems to be the only way in or out.
4679000 4681280 All other information on your level<br />is restricted.
4681360 4684360 Open up in there. Open up in there.
4685200 4686640 Oh, no.
4686720 4688360 There isn't any other way out.
4693840 4696200 I can't hold them off forever. Now what?
4696280 4697320 This is some rescue.
4697680 4699760 When you came in here,<br />didn't you have a plan for getting out?
4699880 4701880 He's the brains, sweetheart.
4701960 4703560 Well, I didn't...
4705000 4708200 -What the hell are you doing?<br />-Somebody has to save our skins.
4710400 4712200 Into the garbage chute, flyboy.
4719760 4720800 Get in there!
4721960 4724960 Get in there, you big furry oaf.<br />I don't care what you smell.
4726040 4728320 Get in there, and don't worry about it.
4731040 4732080 Wonderful girl.
4734240 4736240 Either I'm gonna kill her,<br />or I'm beginning to like her.
4738920 4739920 Get in there.
4753520 4757000 The garbage chute was<br />a really wonderful idea.
4757080 4759520 What an incredible smell<br />you've discovered.
4762560 4764400 Let's get out of here.
4764480 4766920 -Get away from there.<br />-No, wait.
4773560 4775920 Forget it! I already tried it!<br />It's magnetically sealed.
4776040 4778360 Put that thing away!<br />You're gonna get us all killed!
4778440 4780160 Absolutely, Your Worship.
4780240 4782680 Look, I had everything under control<br />till you led us down here.
4783400 4785800 It's not gonna take 'em long<br />to figure out what happened to us.
4785880 4787160 It could be worse.
4792000 4793080 It's worse.
4793160 4796160 -There's something alive in here.<br />-That's your imagination.
4797120 4798920 Something just moved past my leg.
4800800 4803800 -Look. Did you see that?<br />-What?
4825480 4827200 Kid! Luke!
4839800 4841560 Grab hold of this!
4841880 4844000 Blast it! My gun's jammed.
4844080 4846840 -Where?<br />-Anywhere!
4879440 4881080 Help him!
4881160 4883160 -What happened?<br />-I don't know.
4883240 4886080 It just let go of me and disappeared.
4892080 4894520 I got a bad feeling about this.
4900240 4903400 -The walls are moving!<br />-Try and brace it with something.
4912080 4913600 Help me.
4926520 4928320 Wait a minute.
4930680 4933880 3PO! Come in, 3PO!
4934680 4936160 <i>3PO!</i>
4936240 4938320 <i>Where could he be?</i>
4942480 4944640 Take over. See to him.
4947120 4948600 Look, there.
4951040 4953400 They're madmen.<br />They're heading for the prison level.
4953480 4955400 If you hurry, you might catch them.
4955480 4957000 Follow me.
4960720 4962760 You stand guard.
4967480 4968800 Come on.
4976720 4979880 All this excitement has overrun<br />the circuits in my counterpart here.
4980000 4983120 If you don't mind, I'd like to<br />take him down to maintenance.
4983200 4984720 All right.
4996920 4999720 3PO. Come in, 3PO.
4999800 5001200 3PO.
5001280 5004000 -Get on top.<br />-I can't.
5004080 5005960 Where could he be? 3PO.
5007360 5009200 3PO, will you come in?
5009920 5012240 They aren't here. Something must have<br />happened to them.
5012320 5014880 See if they've been captured. Hurry.
5018720 5021640 One thing's for sure.<br />We're all gonna be a lot thinner.
5024080 5026880 -Get on top of it.<br />-I'm trying.
5032240 5036160 Thank goodness they haven't<br />found them. Where could they be?
5037560 5040280 "Use the comlink"? Oh, my.
5040360 5041920 I forgot. I turned it off.
5046160 5048920 -Are you there, sir?<br />-3PO?
5049240 5051920 -We've had some problems.<br /><i>-Shut up and listen to me.</i>
5052000 5055760 <i>Shut down all the garbage mashers</i><br /><i>on the detention level. Do you copy?</i>
5055840 5058800 Shut down all the garbage mashers<br />on the detention level!
5059920 5062600 <i>Shut down all the garbage mashers</i><br /><i>on the detention level!</i>
5062680 5065440 No, shut them all down. Hurry! Oh, no.
5077080 5078560 What?
5079600 5081400 You did great, 3PO!
5081920 5083880 Listen to them. They're dying, R2.
5083960 5086120 Curse my metal body.<br />I wasn't fast enough.
5086200 5089280 It's all my fault. My poor master.
5089360 5090960 We're all right. You did great!
5091960 5094320 Hey! Open the pressure<br />maintenance hatch
5094400 5095800 on unit number... Where are we?
5096320 5099200 <i>3263827.</i>
5145280 5148720 If we can avoid any more female advice,<br />we oughta be able to get out of here.
5148800 5150480 Let's get moving.
5152240 5154360 Where you goin'?
5154440 5156240 Wait! They'll hear!
5158080 5159440 Come here, you big coward.
5159520 5161200 -Chewie, come here.<br />-Listen.
5162080 5164840 I don't know who you are<br />or where you came from,
5164920 5167760 but from now on,<br />you do as I tell you, okay?
5168640 5171600 Look, Your Worshipfulness,<br />let's get one thing straight.
5171680 5174960 I take orders from just one person. Me.
5175040 5176960 It's a wonder you're still alive.
5177040 5180280 Will somebody get<br />this big walking carpet out of my way?
5180360 5182600 No reward is worth this.
5192800 5194760 Give me regular reports, please.
5194880 5195960 Right.
5198120 5201400 -Do you know what's going on?<br />-Maybe it's another drill.
5206400 5208440 You seen that new VT-16?
5208560 5210480 Yeah. Some of the other guys<br />were telling me about it.
5210560 5212800 They say it's quite a thing to see.
5212880 5215080 What was that?
5215160 5218440 It's nothing. Outgassing.<br />Don't worry about it.
5223440 5225560 -There she is.<br />-C-3PO, do you copy?
5225640 5226640 <i>Yes, sir.</i>
5226720 5228600 -Are you safe?<br /><i>-For the moment.</i>
5229120 5230960 We're in the main hangar<br />across from the ship.
5233320 5234640 We're right above you. Stand by.
5235160 5237720 You came in that thing?<br />You're braver than I thought.
5237840 5239840 Nice. Come on.
5243480 5244880 It's them. Blast them.
5246640 5247680 Get back to the ship!
5247760 5249960 -Where are you going?<br />-He certainly has courage.
5250040 5253160 What good will it do us<br />if he gets himself killed? Come on.
5278640 5280640 I think we took a wrong turn.
5285560 5286640 There's no lock.
5290880 5293560 -That oughta hold them for a while.<br />-Quick. We've got to get across.
5293640 5296960 -Find the controls to extend the bridge.<br />-I think I just blasted it.
5297040 5298680 They're coming through.
5321040 5322680 Here, hold this.
5339440 5340600 Here they come.
5351440 5352960 For luck.
5359120 5363840 We think they may be splitting up.<br />They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.
5377960 5379960 Where could they be?
5384080 5385640 Close the blast doors.
5392800 5395240 Open the blast doors.<br />Open the blast doors.
5413520 5419040 I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.<br />We meet again at last.
5419120 5420840 The circle is now complete.
5421160 5423120 When I left you, I was but the learner.
5423200 5425600 Now I am the master.
5425680 5428000 Only a master of evil, Darth.
5448000 5450280 Your powers are weak, old man.
5450960 5454120 You can't win, Darth.<br />If you strike me down,
5454200 5457600 I shall become more powerful<br />than you can possibly imagine.
5464920 5467000 You should not have come back.
5492720 5494360 Didn't we just leave this party?
5497120 5499640 -What kept you?<br />-We ran into some old friends.
5499720 5502040 -The ship all right?<br />-Seems okay, if we can get to it.
5502120 5504080 I hope the old man got<br />the tractor beam down.
5519440 5520640 Look.
5523600 5525560 Come on, R2. We're going.
5527240 5528320 Now's our chance. Go!
5558480 5559640 Come on!
5560600 5562200 Come on!
5562280 5565360 -Luke, it's too late!<br />-Blast the door, kid!
5575040 5576520 <i>Run, Luke, run.</i>
5580480 5582160 I hope that old man got<br />the tractor beam down,
5582240 5584080 or this is gonna be a short trip. Hit it!
5616520 5618440 We're coming up on their sentry ships.
5618520 5620120 Hold them off.<br />Angle the deflector shields
5620200 5622040 while I charge up the main guns.
5631080 5633080 I can't believe he's gone.
5637040 5638520 There wasn't anything<br />you could have done.
5639560 5641520 Come on, buddy.<br />We're not out of this yet.
5658360 5660760 You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp.
5671600 5672720 Here they come.
5690720 5692560 They're coming in too fast!
5700560 5704400 -We've lost the lateral controls.<br />-Don't worry. She'll hold together.
5706080 5708000 Hear me, baby? Hold together.
5730000 5731840 Got him. I got him!
5731920 5734120 Great, kid. Don't get cocky.
5735320 5737120 There's still two more.
5770960 5773800 -That's it. We did it.<br />-We did it.
5774760 5777320 Help. I think I'm melting.<br />This is all your fault.
5785320 5786800 Are they away?
5786880 5789800 They've just made the jump<br />into hyperspace.
5789880 5793280 You're sure the homing beacon<br />is secure aboard their ship?
5794480 5797080 I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.
5797160 5798800 This had better work.
5799600 5801840 Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?
5801920 5804960 You know,<br />sometimes I amaze even myself.
5805320 5807480 That doesn't sound too hard.
5807560 5811520 They let us go. It's the only<br />explanation for the ease of our escape.
5811600 5814400 -You call that easy?<br />-They're tracking us.
5814480 5815880 Not this ship, sister.
5817200 5819920 At least the information in R2<br />is still intact.
5820000 5822280 What's so important?<br />What's he carrying?
5822360 5825480 The technical readouts<br />of that battle station.
5825560 5828880 I only hope that when the data's<br />analyzed a weakness can be found.
5828960 5832320 -It's not over yet.<br />-It is for me, sister.
5832400 5835960 I ain't in this for your revolution,<br />and I'm not in it for you, Princess.
5836040 5838920 I expect to be well paid.<br />I'm in it for the money.
5839000 5841040 You needn't worry about your reward.
5841120 5844040 If money is all that you love,<br />then that's what you'll receive.
5847200 5849200 Your friend is quite a mercenary.
5849280 5852480 I wonder if he really cares<br />about anything or anybody.
5853720 5855240 I care.
5861680 5863320 So...
5863880 5865600 What do you think of her, Han?
5865680 5867280 I'm trying not to, kid.
5868400 5869400 Good.
5873320 5875680 Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
5878320 5880920 What do you think? You think<br />a princess and a guy like me...
5881000 5882000 No.
5929440 5932480 You're safe. When we heard about<br />Alderaan, we feared the worst.
5932560 5934480 We have no time for sorrows,<br />Commander.
5934560 5937600 You must use the information<br />in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.
5937680 5939640 It's our only hope.
5960760 5963440 -Yes.<br /><i>-We're approaching the planet Yavin.</i>
5963560 5965880 <i>The rebel base is on a moon</i><br /><i>on the far side.</i>
5965960 5967960 <i>We are preparing to orbit the planet.</i>
5976960 5979040 The battle station is heavily shielded
5979160 5982600 and carries a firepower<br />greater than half the starfleet.
5983320 5987400 Its defenses are designed around<br />a direct large-scale assault.
5988040 5992720 A small, one-man fighter should be able<br />to penetrate the outer defense.
5994480 5995600 Pardon me for asking, sir,
5995720 5998320 but what good are snub fighters<br />against that?
5998400 6003000 The Empire doesn't consider a small,<br />one-man fighter to be any threat
6003080 6005800 or they'd have a tighter defense.
6005880 6009160 An analysis of the plans<br />provided by Princess Leia
6009240 6012360 has demonstrated a weakness<br />in the battle station.
6013200 6015200 The approach will not be easy.
6015800 6018400 You're required to maneuver<br />straight down this trench
6018480 6021120 and skim the surface to this point.
6021920 6024760 The target area is only two meters wide.
6024840 6028440 It's a small thermal exhaust port<br />right below the main port.
6030000 6032880 The shaft leads directly<br />to the reactor system.
6032960 6035680 A precise hit will start a chain reaction
6035800 6038040 which should destroy the station.
6038120 6041640 Only a precise hit will<br />set up a chain reaction.
6041720 6044880 The shaft is ray-shielded,<br />so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
6045360 6047120 That's impossible, even for a computer.
6047200 6051040 No, it's not. I used to bull's-eye<br />womp rats in my T-16 back home.
6051120 6053560 They're not much bigger<br />than two meters.
6053640 6056760 Then man your ships,<br />and may the Force be with you.
6065040 6067600 <i>Orbiting the planet</i><br /><i>at maximum velocity.</i>
6068280 6072200 <i>The moon with the rebel base</i><br /><i>will be in range in 30 minutes.</i>
6072280 6074720 This will be a day long remembered.
6074840 6076800 It has seen the end of Kenobi
6076880 6079960 and will soon see<br />the end of the rebellion.
6085200 6088480 <i>All flight crews, man your stations.</i>
6093920 6097040 So, you got your reward<br />and you're just leaving, then?
6097120 6099120 That's right. Yeah.
6100240 6102840 I got some old debts<br />I gotta pay off with this stuff.
6102920 6104760 Even if I didn't,<br />you don't think I'd be fool enough
6104840 6107040 to stick around here, do ya?
6107600 6109000 Why don't you come with us?
6109080 6110880 You're pretty good in a fight.<br />We could use ya.
6111000 6113840 Come on.<br />Why don't you take a look around?
6113920 6116600 You know what's about to happen,<br />what they're up against.
6116720 6119480 They could use a good pilot like you.<br />You're turning your back on them.
6120080 6122000 What good's a reward<br />if you ain't around to use it?
6122480 6125280 Besides, attacking that battle station<br />ain't my idea of courage.
6125360 6128000 It's more like suicide.
6129840 6132680 All right.<br />Well, take care of yourself, Han.
6132760 6135400 I guess that's what you're best at,<br />isn't it?
6135760 6136840 Hey, Luke.
6140160 6142520 May the Force be with you.
6149040 6152640 What are you looking at?<br />I know what I'm doing.
6156640 6159120 <i>All pilots to your stations.</i>
6167760 6170320 -What's wrong?<br />-It's Han.
6170400 6172880 I don't know.<br />I really thought he'd change his mind.
6172960 6176520 He's got to follow his own path.<br />No one can choose it for him.
6177520 6180320 I only wish Ben were here.
6188000 6190880 <i>Open main launch tubes.</i>
6190960 6192880 <i>Main launch tubes opening, sir.</i>
6193000 6194680 Hey, Luke!
6194760 6197960 -Biggs!<br />-I don't believe it. How are ya?
6198040 6200120 -Coming up?<br />-I'll be up there with you.
6200200 6202760 -Have I got stories to tell you.<br />-Skywalker.
6204320 6205840 Are you sure you can handle this ship?
6205920 6209720 Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot<br />in the outer-rim territories.
6210320 6212880 -You'll do all right.<br />-Thank you, sir. I'll try.
6212960 6216880 Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your<br />stories when we get back, all right?
6216960 6219680 Hey, Biggs.<br />I told you I'd make it someday.
6219760 6222760 It'll be like old times, Luke.<br />They'll never stop us.
6225640 6228600 This R2 unit of yours seems<br />a bit beat up. You want a new one?
6229160 6231800 Not on your life. That droid and I<br />have been through a lot.
6231880 6232960 You okay, R2?
6234560 6236000 Good.
6237040 6240400 <i>Gold squadron,</i><br /><i>begin takeoff procedure.</i>
6240480 6243440 Hang on tight, R2.<br />You've got to come back.
6245320 6247320 You wouldn't want my life<br />to get boring, would you?
6296160 6299160 <i>Luke, the Force will be with you.</i>
6310920 6314240 <i>Standby alert. Death Star approaching.</i>
6314320 6317480 <i>Estimated time to firing range,</i><br /><i>15 minutes.</i>
6330560 6332880 -All wings report in.<br />-Red 10 standing by.
6332960 6335200 <i>-Red Seven standing by.</i><br />-Red Three standing by.
6335280 6338040 -Red Six standing by.<br /><i>-Red Nine standing by.</i>
6338120 6340120 -Red Two standing by.<br /><i>-Red 11 standing by.</i>
6340200 6342160 Red Five standing by.
6343520 6345440 Lock S-foils in attack position.
6349680 6351720 <i>We're passing</i><br /><i>through the magnetic field.</i>
6351800 6354600 Hold tight. Switch your deflectors on.
6354680 6356120 <i>Double front.</i>
6359120 6360640 Look at the size of that thing.
6360720 6363560 Cut the chatter, Red Two.<br />Accelerate to attack speed.
6367000 6369800 -This is it, boys.<br />-Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
6369880 6372760 <i>-I copy, Gold Leader.</i><br />-We're starting for the target shaft.
6372840 6376280 We're in position. I'm going to cut<br />across the axis and draw their fire.
6390680 6393960 <i>-Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.</i><br /><i>-I see it. Stay low.</i>
6401400 6403000 This is Red Five. I'm going in.
6407480 6408480 <i>Luke, pull up!</i>
6410400 6412480 -You all right?<br />-A little cooked, but I'm okay.
6418480 6422400 We count 30 rebel ships, but they're so<br />small they're evading our turbolasers.
6422520 6424440 We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.
6424520 6426600 Get the crews to their fighters.
6429160 6431000 Watch yourself. There's a lot of fire
6431080 6433360 coming from<br />the right side of that deflection tower.
6433440 6434440 I'm on it.
6434520 6437920 -I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.<br />-Right with you, Red Three.
6444280 6446120 I've got a problem here.
6446200 6447600 -Eject.<br />-I can hold it.
6447680 6449880 -Pull up!<br />-No, I'm all right...
6454040 6457680 <i>The rebel base will be in firing range</i><br /><i>in seven minutes.</i>
6460880 6463760 <i>Luke, trust your feelings.</i>
6471680 6473320 Squad leaders,
6473400 6475520 we've picked up a new group of signals.
6475600 6477200 Enemy fighters coming your way.
6477280 6478960 My scope's negative.<br />I don't see anything.
6479040 6481240 -Pick up your visual scanning.<br /><i>-Here they come.</i>
6484480 6486240 You've got one on your tail.
6491560 6492600 I'm hit!
6493920 6496400 -You've picked one up. Watch it.<br />-I can't see it.
6498400 6500160 He's on me tight. I can't shake him.
6502080 6504160 I'll be right there.
6516080 6519520 Several fighters have broken off<br />from the main group. Come with me.
6522960 6526120 <i>-Fall in. Fall in.</i><br /><i>-Watch your back, Luke.</i>
6526760 6528400 <i>Fighters above you, coming in.</i>
6534800 6537520 I'm hit, but not bad.<br />R2, see what you can do with it.
6537600 6539800 <i>Hang on back there.</i>
6540360 6542560 <i>Red Six, can you see Red Five?</i>
6542640 6545040 <i>There's a heavy fire zone.</i><br /><i>Red Five, where are you?</i>
6545440 6546880 I can't shake him.
6550560 6552120 I'm on him, Luke.
6555320 6556960 Blast it, Biggs. Where are you?
6564200 6566760 <i>-Thanks, Wedge.</i><br /><i>-Good shooting, Wedge.</i>
6566840 6570000 <i>Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.</i><br /><i>We're starting our attack run.</i>
6571840 6574160 <i>I copy, Gold Leader.</i><br /><i>Move into position.</i>
6576560 6578920 Stay in attack formation.
6579000 6581840 <i>The exhaust port</i><br /><i>is marked and locked in.</i>
6587680 6590840 Switch all power<br />to front deflector screen.
6590920 6594160 Switch all power<br />to front deflector screen.
6598840 6600640 How many guns do you think,<br />Gold Five?
6600720 6603960 <i>Say about 20 guns, some on</i><br /><i>the surface, some on the towers.</i>
6604080 6606840 <i>Death Star will be in range</i><br /><i>in five minutes.</i>
6609040 6612040 Switch to targeting computer.
6614520 6616520 Computer's locked. Getting a signal.
6618880 6621040 The guns. They've stopped.
6622720 6625520 Stabilize your rear deflectors.<br />Watch for enemy fighters.
6625600 6627800 <i>They're coming in. Three marks at 210.</i>
6630040 6631960 I'll take them myself. Cover me.
6632040 6633360 Yes, sir.
6647840 6650360 -It's no good. I can't maneuver.<br />-Stay on target.
6650440 6652320 -We're too close.<br />-Stay on target.
6654120 6655120 Loosen up!
6658080 6660960 Gold Five to Red Leader,<br />lost Tiree, lost Hutch.
6661040 6663400 -I copy, Gold Leader.<br />-They came from behind.
6669760 6672400 We've analyzed their attack, sir,<br />and there is a danger.
6672480 6674400 Should I have your ship standing by?
6674480 6677360 Evacuate? In our moment of triumph?
6677440 6679920 I think you overestimate their chances.
6680600 6682640 <i>Rebel base, three minutes and closing.</i>
6683640 6685280 Red boys, this is Red Leader.
6685360 6687040 <i>Rendezvous at mark 6.1.</i>
6687160 6690960 <i>-This is Red Two flying toward you.</i><br /><i>-Red Three standing by.</i>
6691040 6692720 Red Leader, this is Base One.
6692800 6695480 <i>Keep half your group out of range</i><br /><i>for the next run.</i>
6695560 6698200 <i>Copy, Base One.</i><br /><i>Luke, take Red Two and Three.</i>
6698280 6701600 Hold up here and wait for<br />my signal to start your run.
6710240 6711520 This is it.
6715840 6716920 We should be able to see it by now.
6719640 6721400 Keep your eyes open for those fighters.
6723200 6725600 There's too much interference.<br />Red Five, can you see them?
6725680 6728680 -No sign of any... Wait. Coming in .35.<br />-I see them.
6730200 6731320 I'm in range.
6732560 6733560 Target's coming up.
6736880 6739040 Just hold them off for a few seconds.
6739880 6741480 Close up formation.
6743200 6744840 Almost there.
6754040 6757360 -Let her loose. They're right behind me.<br />-Almost there.
6758720 6760400 I can't hold them.
6768360 6769400 It's away!
6773840 6775480 <i>-It's a hit!</i><br /><i>-Negative.</i>
6775560 6777640 Negative. It didn't go in.
6777720 6780400 <i>It just impacted on the surface.</i>
6786880 6787960 <i>Red Leader, we're right above you.</i>
6788040 6790800 Turn to .05. We'll cover for you.
6790880 6793800 <i>Stay there. I just lost</i><br /><i>my starboard engine.</i>
6794600 6796880 Get set up for your attack run.
6810240 6812800 <i>Rebel base, one minute and closing.</i>
6813560 6815160 <i>Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.</i>
6815240 6818600 <i>We're going in full throttle. That ought</i><br /><i>to keep those fighters off our back.</i>
6818680 6819680 Right with you, boss.
6820920 6823200 At that speed,<br />will you be able to pull out in time?
6823280 6825280 It'll be just like<br />Beggars Canyon back home.
6832640 6834920 We'll stay back far enough to cover you.
6835000 6837560 <i>My scope shows the tower,</i><br /><i>but I can't see the exhaust port.</i>
6837640 6839080 Are you sure the computer can hit it?
6842600 6844600 Watch yourself.<br />Increase speed, full throttle.
6844680 6845960 What about that tower?
6846040 6848480 You worry about those fighters.<br />I'll worry about the tower.
6854840 6858480 R2, that stabilizer's broken loose<br />again. See if you can't lock it down.
6867640 6869440 <i>Fighters coming in .3.</i>
6878320 6880880 <i>-I'm hit. I can't stay with you.</i><br /><i>-Get clear, Wedge.</i>
6880960 6882120 You can't do any more good back there.
6882200 6883480 Sorry.
6884520 6886480 Let him go. Stay on the leader.
6889400 6891640 Hurry, Luke.<br />They're coming in much faster this time.
6895800 6897040 R2, try and increase the power.
6903840 6905160 <i>Hurry up, Luke. Quick.</i>
6906040 6907200 Quick.
6914200 6916800 <i>Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.</i>
6916880 6918000 I'm on the leader.
6921440 6922920 Hang on, R2.
6938760 6941360 <i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>
6944120 6946160 <i>Let go, Luke.</i>
6947840 6950040 The Force is strong with this one.
6950120 6952080 <i>Luke, trust me.</i>
6957240 6959080 <i>His computer's off.</i>
6959160 6961280 <i>You switched off your</i><br /><i>targeting computer. What's wrong?</i>
6961360 6964040 <i>Nothing. I'm all right.</i>
6977240 6978480 <i>I've lost R2.</i>
6979920 6982200 <i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>
6982280 6984600 <i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>
6985640 6987280 <i>Rebel base in range.</i>
6987360 6989280 You may fire when ready.
6990000 6991440 <i>Commence primary ignition.</i>
7005440 7006840 I have you now.
7009280 7010480 What?
7013080 7014120 Look out.
7020760 7023600 You're all clear, kid.<br />Now let's blow this thing and go home.
7030440 7032080 <i>Stand by.</i>
7035440 7037160 <i>Stand by.</i>
7046960 7048880 Great shot, kid!<br />That was one in a million!
7050320 7054800 <i>Remember, the Force</i><br /><i>will be with you always.</i>
7080400 7082040 I just knew you'd come back.
7082120 7084680 I wasn't gonna let you get all<br />the credit and take all the reward.
7084760 7087080 I knew there was more to you<br />than money.
7087600 7088680 Oh, no.
7088760 7091200 Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?
7091880 7094760 Say something.<br />You can repair him, can't you?
7094840 7098080 -We'll get to work on him right away.<br />-You must repair him.
7098160 7101120 Sir, if any of my circuits or gears<br />will help, I'll gladly donate them.
7101200 7103200 He'll be all right.
