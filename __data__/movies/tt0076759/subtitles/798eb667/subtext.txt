116520 122397 On Star Wars, I came in as a camera<br />assistant with Dennis and we really had
122421 127420 our hands in a lot of different sequences.<br />I think we shot probably the
127620 132080 majority of the motion control spaceship<br />shots. There's a small attack of the TIE
132205 135760 fighters at the beginning of the film,<br />attacking the Millennium Falcon. We did a
135810 141017 lot of that. The opening of the show,<br />I believe we did a couple of those shots
141041 145560 with the cruiser. We also did the<br />sequence with the blockade runner at the
145710 149797 start of the film where the pod ejects.<br />We did a lot of that. Originally, I think
149821 154137 the blockade runner was going to be<br />used as the ship in the opening shot, as the
154161 158000 big ship. Oh that's incorrect.<br />The blockade runner was going to be used
158200 161920 as the Millennium Falcon. That was the<br />original design, and then they changed it
162120 167820 for, thank goodness, for design reasons.<br />A lot of the original ship designs were
168815 170420 done by Colin Cantwell.
171090 173921 There's some models<br />somewhere in the archives of
173945 176740 these very rough prototypes<br />that were designed.
177920 180675 And at that point,<br />like I was saying, the blockade
180699 183200 runner was going to be<br />the Millennium Falcon.
183960 186540 And probably for reasons only George knows,<br />and
186564 189500 maybe Joe Johnston,<br />as they were designing the ships,
190120 194780 they decided to use it because its design<br />wasn't as interesting as maybe they wanted
194930 198480 because the Millennium Falcon<br />was sort of a star itself in the film.
199080 201491 They wanted something with more personality,<br />and
201515 203900 so they came up with<br />what you see in the movie.
205520 209456 And I have recollections<br />of shooting multitudes of
209480 213520 wedges on the back of the<br />blockade runner's rockets
213795 216840 for color diffusions to get<br />just the right glow to them.
216900 218840 The same with all the<br />spaceships in the film.
219510 224900 We shot a lot of the blockade runner<br />on what was called the Rama camera,
225000 228460 which only had a motion<br />control track of perhaps 15 feet.
228655 234220 And the camera was this<br />refurbished old Technicolor camera.
234320 236680 It was a huge, heavy monstrosity.
237670 242217 And so the shots that didn't have a<br />tremendous amount of choreography to them
242241 245900 or had to have the ships do a lot of<br />eccentric motion were done on the Rama camera.
247480 251180 I remember being electrocuted on<br />that camera once, standing on the railing,
252410 255940 and I grabbed a 10K light<br />that wasn't wired correctly
256040 258456 and got zapped off the rails onto the floor.
258480 259580 That was good.
297525 299190 R2-D2, where are you?
316000 318040 At last! Where have you been?
318950 320416 They're heading in this direction.
320855 321580 What are we going to do?
321855 325045 We'll be sent to the spice mines of<br />Kessel or smashed into who knows what.
326590 328120 Wait a minute. Where are you going?
336660 344160 The Death Star plans are<br />not in the main computer.
344620 347477 Where are those<br />transmissions you intercepted?
347501 349660 What have you done with those plans?
350455 351920 We intercepted no transmissions.
352780 354280 This is a consular ship.
355380 357040 We're on a diplomatic mission.
357270 361080 If this is a consular ship,<br />where is the ambassador?
365080 368280 Commander, tear this ship apart<br />until you've found those plans,
368580 370640 and bring me the passengers.<br />I want them alive.
384235 385540 There's one. Set for stun.
391960 394680 She'll be all right.<br />Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
396480 398722 Hey, you're not permitted in there.<br />It's restricted.
399340 400780 You'll be deactivated for sure.
403200 406116 Don't you call me a mindless philosopher,<br />you overweight glob of grease.
406140 407778 Now come out before somebody sees you.
410150 413160 Secret mission? What plans?<br />What are you talking about?
413510 414610 I'm not getting in there.
418350 419450 I'm going to regret this.
427390 430330 There goes another one.<br />Hold your fire. There's no life forms.
431250 432457 And lots of short-circuited.
432850 435394 That's funny. The damage<br />doesn't look as bad from out here.
437870 439390 Are you sure this thing is safe?
440790 441890 No.
459195 461570 Darth Vader, only you could be so bold.
462205 464211 The Imperial Senate<br />will not sit still for this.
464235 467586 When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...<br />You're not so surprised, Your Highness.
467610 469910 You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
470160 473110 Several transmissions were<br />beamed to the ship by rebel spies.
473910 476550 I want to know what happened<br />to the plans they sent you.
477140 478822 I don't know what you're talking about.
478905 482250 I'm a member of the Imperial Senate<br />on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.
482450 485890 You are part of a rebel alliance<br />and a traitor. Take her away.
490870 491550 Hold her.
491690 492150 Holding her is dangerous.
492680 496215 Word of this gets out, it could generate<br />sympathy for the rebellion in the Senate.
496425 498590 I have traced the rebel spies to her.
499110 501650 Now she is my only link<br />to finding their secret base.
501910 503706 She'll die before she'll tell you anything.
503730 504830 Leave that to me.
505050 508810 Send a distress signal and then inform<br />the Senate that all aboard were killed.
509050 512010 Lord Vader, the battle station<br />plans are not aboard this ship.
512590 513927 And no transmissions were made.
514410 516523 An escape pod was<br />jettisoned during the fighting.
516770 518064 But no life forms were aboard.
518700 520813 She must have hidden<br />the plans in the escape pod.
521240 522826 Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
522850 524230 See to it personally, Commander.
524810 526621 There will be no one to stop us this time.
526790 527890 Yes, sir.
536870 540940 Tatooine was defined as a<br />total desert over its whole surface.
542710 546360 And you look for ways<br />to make it otherworldly.
547850 551317 And in a sense, when you start to<br />dream up something otherworldly,
551341 556000 you usually come up against the<br />fact that you find things on Earth
556200 560300 that are more otherworldly looking<br />than the stuff that you can make up.
561610 565460 George mentioned that he<br />loved the robot from Metropolis.
566700 571480 And he thought that the 3PO should<br />basically be like the robot from Metropolis,
571950 576540 with the exception that he have a<br />male body instead of a female body.
577450 581380 And I looked at the robot from Metropolis,<br />and I liked it.
582150 584577 Also,<br />I had feelings that it would be interesting
584601 591800 if he was more of a<br />sort of Ernst Trova figure.
592460 595897 Ernst Trova, back in those days in the 60s,
595921 600917 was doing these beautiful sculptures<br />and drawings of a kind of robot figure
600941 605314 that was gold and smooth<br />and very elegant and
605338 609240 balanced and classic<br />sort of sculptural thing.
609640 614160 And I saw him moving as a<br />sort of ballerina-like ballet dancer,
614400 616820 sort of very elegant and graceful,
617500 619613 which I thought would<br />be interesting for a robot,
620750 624220 because all the robots we've seen<br />move kind of like Frankenstein's monster,
624590 626580 you know, clump, clump, clump,
627440 630800 and big feet and arms<br />outstretched and so forth.
631910 636920 And I thought, gee, this robot could<br />be a really elegant dancer-like guy,
637520 638900 you know, it would be wonderful.
639640 643240 The images originally were of<br />this very smooth and elegant figure,
644370 646540 which I kind of liked, but I was wrong,
647135 650780 because he wouldn't have had the<br />personality that he needed to have.
651450 655020 There's something about those big<br />round eyes, which I hadn't conceived of,
655930 661060 and the whole cut of him that has a<br />sort of comical something about him,
661230 663360 a sort of astonished look that he has.
663580 665089 The whole thing worked beautifully,
665650 668260 and really John Barry<br />is responsible for that.
669640 670804 He's the guy that fixed it.
671400 672500 Over here!
673810 677497 Well, for R2,<br />I was looking for something different
677521 681080 than the little robots that<br />were done for Silent Running
682160 683367 that Doug Trumbull had done.
684380 685160 They were square,
685440 689680 and I knew that our robots<br />would be compared to their robots.
691200 693096 Because George had talked about them,<br />you know,
693120 695880 he'd said, well, you know the<br />little robots in Silent Running,
696500 699320 we wanted a little worker<br />robot like that for R2-D2.
700340 703380 And I thought, well,<br />I'll make him, instead of a box,
703540 707140 I'll make him a can, you know,<br />a cylinder with a dome on top.
708005 711717 That was my first thought,<br />just strictly in the sense
711741 715080 that I didn't want him to look<br />like the Silent Running robots.
716520 720280 They had two legs,<br />so I thought we could give R2 three legs.
722090 725240 The first one I did,<br />I think he had a spherical bottom.
725690 727816 It was like a ball bearing<br />that would roll around.
727840 728777 He could go any direction.
728801 731880 He had gyroscopes in him<br />so that he didn't fall over,
732060 734417 and he just leaned into<br />whatever direction he wanted to do
734441 737560 and spun his single wheel,<br />which is really a sphere,
737800 742360 which sounded pretty interesting,<br />but very difficult to do in reality.
743435 748080 And I put little panels on him<br />and places for arms to come out.
748140 751280 I knew he had to have a<br />lot of little gadgets that...
751680 753793 He was kind of like a Swiss Army knife,<br />you know.
754490 757397 And he had to have lights and he<br />had to have lenses to see through.
757421 761300 He had to have color to<br />distinguish him from another robot,
761480 763680 so I found places to put blue.
1244870 1247689 It's funny that that,<br />you know, the hologram
1247713 1250620 that R2-D2 spits out<br />and shows Princess Leia.
1251130 1253840 Something like that gets a<br />lot of reaction and feedback.
1253900 1257480 Because you say it's,<br />you imply it's a hologram in the film.
1258010 1260860 All it was,<br />was a shot of Carrie against Black.
1261890 1264175 And then that was<br />re-photographed off of a TV screen.
1264510 1266960 With a lot of static<br />and roll bars and things.
1267110 1268404 And just matted into the shot.
1268780 1271755 And people, a lot of people, I think,<br />thought it was a real hologram.
1645360 1646930 We shot the land speeder
1647080 1648227 for some of the shots.
1648251 1651867 I can remember the Tuscan<br />raiders running up to edges of cliffs
1651891 1655810 and we would shoot these little<br />models racing down in the distance.
1656710 1658823 A lot of people had their<br />hands in that sequence.
1658880 1660070 There's a shot where
1661710 1663004 it's racing across the desert.
1663110 1666610 A lot of that stuff was done<br />on location with simple tricks
1666785 1669113 with putting mirrors on the<br />bottom of the land speeder
1669840 1671110 and just letting that work.
1671230 1672394 And it worked out terrific.
1672680 1674879 And what we would do is<br />add perhaps a little shadow
1675890 1678261 under it to give the impression<br />it was above the ground.
1678650 1682450 A lot of the shots of it flying or where it's<br />parked outside I think Dennis and I shot.
1683560 1685730 At a certain point in the schedule
1686225 1688208 Dennis and I wound up<br />going on the night shift
1688990 1690881 because there was only<br />so much equipment to use.
1690905 1694610 So Richard and Doug Smith and some of<br />the other guys were using it in the daytime.
1694750 1696173 We would come in around 3 o'clock
1696850 1698963 and take over so we could<br />use the same equipment.
1699170 1701230 And I think we would work till like
1701430 1703350 3 or 4 in the morning every night.
1935860 1939854 You know I tried in my<br />going through mythology
1939878 1943460 to distill down into<br />certain basic ideas.
1944425 1947197 Things that seem to exist<br />in a great deal of mythology.
1947221 1952720 Again to try to find themes and ideas<br />that continue over a great amount of time.
1954100 1957360 And across a wide spectrum of cultures.
1958120 1959414 The force is a result of that.
1959830 1963622 It's a force of the way that many<br />people view the great mysteries
1963646 1967580 of is there other realities at work<br />other than one we can perceive.
1969390 1972520 I think that the force represents life.
1973525 1975594 I mean another way to<br />describe it is life force.
1975860 1977020 It's the spirit of life.
1977220 1978956 Rather than physical manifestation of it.
1978980 1981567 The father wanted you to have<br />this when you were old enough.
1982100 1984728 What Luke is doing in the<br />beginning of Star Wars is
1984752 1987820 defining his own responsibility<br />for his place in the world.
1988150 1993160 He thinks that his responsibility is with<br />his aunt and uncle and to do his chores.
1993620 1996925 And his ultimate responsibility<br />is much larger than that
1996949 2000100 because it deals with a<br />much larger base of humanity.
2000760 2002040 Larger more cosmic issues.
2002265 2007160 He is unwilling to look up and see<br />those as something that relate to him.
2007920 2012360 He is much more looking at the ground<br />and plotting along in his everyday life.
2015960 2019894 So it's that awakening first of<br />all that is performed by the insider
2019918 2023760 and magic of Obi-Wan that sends<br />him on the path to self-discovery.
2438850 2439800 Darth Vader was a little different.
2439900 2441625 We had somebody who was just very large.
2441700 2444785 And therefore,<br />it was much more difficult for us to
2444809 2448040 find somebody who could<br />take and put a voice to that.
2449625 2450776 Because he didn't move around a lot.
2450800 2452500 The suit was very restrictive.
2453645 2456431 And it was very hard for him<br />to get any kind of articulate
2456455 2458780 gestures out that made<br />sense in terms of acting.
2822460 2825370 Well, Chewbacca was another guy<br />who was kind of based
2825394 2830490 on an illustration from a science fiction<br />novel of the past.
2831750 2835398 George had a Xerox copy of<br />this thing which showed a tall,
2835422 2840490 hairy figure<br />carrying a weapon, I think.
2841120 2844770 And I did some sketches,<br />sort of variations on that theme.
2845500 2849170 George was talking about a lemur look,<br />big lemur eyes.
2850940 2852040 And I did some
2852450 2853830 real big ape-like
2854640 2860207 huge muscular sort of superhero figure<br />with this lemur face with a flak jacket on
2860231 2864791 and all kinds of bandoleers of ammunition<br />and so forth strapped around him.
2865370 2868910 And those kind of served<br />to stand for what I did.
2869170 2871270 The person that actually modeled him
2871870 2874811 and who had done<br />the ape figures for 2001
2876660 2880570 actually did him and gave him<br />the personality that he finally had.
3213885 3216970 The hyperspace stuff,<br />I can recall when the...
3217630 3220210 The Millennium Falcon<br />blasts into the hyperspace,
3221450 3224750 doing a lot of tests on<br />the star field with Dennis,
3224880 3227370 just trying to see what we<br />could do to streak the stars,
3227580 3230070 and I think that the shot<br />in the movie is a test.
3230710 3233026 I don't think we ever thought<br />we were doing the real shot,
3233050 3236197 and we got an element that looked<br />interesting, so they put that in there,
3236350 3237450 and that's what it was.
3238175 3240306 And it works out great<br />because of the way it's cut.
3240330 3242507 I mean, it's a beautiful<br />sequence where you go from...
3242531 3245070 It blasts off, and then you cut to Alderaan.
3245860 3247227 That's all I really recall.
3247251 3249650 It wasn't that complicated for us.
3249710 3251166 I mean, it was a very simple shot.
3251190 3254870 It was a blue screen of the interior of<br />the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon
3256070 3257510 and a star field.
3257910 3261110 Two elements not too hard<br />once we got the look down,
3261210 3263797 which, like I say,<br />probably happened faster than we thought.
3643950 3646814 The illustrations that I did<br />of the Death Star kind of
3646838 3649620 went through a transformation<br />as we talked about it.
3649780 3653657 My concept for the Death<br />Star would be a sphere about...
3653681 3656640 Well, first of all,<br />the sphere concept with George...
3657190 3658290 He wanted a sphere.
3659530 3660960 He'd seen something or...
3661440 3664900 For some reason, for him, a sphere<br />was the correct shape for the Death Star.
3665060 3671380 I had other ideas, but mine looked sort<br />of like a big photo enlarger or something.
3671860 3675660 I thought more of a cannon,<br />a sort of thing that would focus energy.
3676265 3681437 And I put that big sort of antenna<br />dish on the side of the Death Star
3681461 3689337 to suggest some kind of energy-focused thing<br />that would serve to be the Star Destroyer.
3689361 3689537 You know?
3689561 3693400 The cannon or whatever you<br />call it that would destroy a star,
3693600 3698580 which is what the Death Star had to do,<br />I understood, vaguely.
3701145 3703996 People who were going to actually<br />have to do these effects on the surface,
3704020 3707380 we were going to have to<br />fly down and skim the surface.
3708200 3711120 And if the surface had to be curved,
3712115 3715081 it was going to cause<br />great difficulties in running a
3715105 3719420 camera through this curve to<br />keep that going as a motion.
3720010 3726437 It was deemed advisable and, in fact, necessary<br />to conceive of a Death Star big enough
3726461 3731020 so that the horizon would be,<br />in effect, flat like we have on Earth.
3731100 3736060 The horizon actually curves, but it's so<br />subtle that it looks like a straight line.
3736590 3737780 That was a necessary thing.
3737960 3739736 So I thought, well, boy,<br />this thing's got to be...
3739760 3741676 I've tried to figure out<br />how big it would be.
3741700 3744420 I've forgotten now what we<br />came up with for dimensions.
3745770 3747200 But it was really immense.
3748220 3749517 So it was like that.
3749541 3750748 It was like flying a planet.
3751880 3754857 Those are the shots of the Death<br />Star when you see it off in the distance
3754881 3757037 and they're looking at it<br />and they're approaching.
3757910 3760560 What it was,<br />it was a big painted Plexiglas half dome.
3761430 3763576 And we just scraped the Plexiglas,<br />the paint off of it,
3763600 3766097 so you could see through it<br />and put some material behind it
3766121 3769357 that would make it sort of translucent<br />and put some lights behind it
3769381 3771376 so it looked like there were little<br />lights that were out of the city,
3771400 3775140 but you were really just sort of looking<br />through a hole and some paint on it.
3775510 3777407 And it was really...<br />that stuff was done very
3777447 3780240 quickly,<br />very low budget considering everything.
3780400 3782210 We'd have to get<br />like three or four of the
3782234 3784200 shots of the Death Star<br />approaching at night.
3784690 3786429 I was shooting mostly<br />at night time when it was
3786453 3788393 very quiet and I could<br />get a lot of work done.
3788815 3792380 And I was working a lot of long<br />hours to get that show done on time.
3792420 3794274 We didn't know if we were going to make it.
5494670 5496505 It was really<br />difficult for all of us to
5496529 5498737 understand what George<br />was talking about when he
5498761 5501517 was saying that these<br />TIE ships should fly fast.
5501541 5504320 Because fast to us meant<br />it would spend three or
5504470 5508027 four seconds to go through the shot and<br />George wanted to go through in half a second.
5508051 5509676 So very quickly,<br />boom, you just see it.
5509700 5511552 You see a glimpse<br />of this racing through.
5511576 5514457 Boom, you see a glimpse of that<br />and we just had to go faster and
5514481 5518312 faster on our programming to<br />get something that George wanted.
5518336 5520397 One way we<br />accomplished the sense
5520421 5522631 of speed was to move the<br />background instead of the model.
5522655 5524177 So there's times when<br />you see the model
5524201 5526303 slowly moving,<br />the TIE ship slowly moving by, but
5526327 5528496 the stars are racing,<br />racing by in the background.
5528520 5530556 That gave that same sense<br />of speed. The advantage
5530580 5533244 of it was it gave a sense of speed<br />when you could see the model.
5533268 5535006 You could see the<br />shape of the TIE ship.
5535030 5537124 The other way,<br />all we had were a bunch of blurs.
5740380 5742039 We shot a lot of the matte paintings,<br />also,
5742063 5744720 that were used at<br />Ralph McQuarrie did a tremendous
5774720 5777476 The first shot that way, a lot of the<br />Death Star shots were done that way.
5777500 5780764 All the Death Stars,<br />except for the real close-up stuff,
5780788 5783900 which Dennis and I shot a lot of,<br />were all paintings.
5784200 5786271 As you got into the<br />closer aerial shots of
5786295 5788540 it,<br />then we went to several different models.
5788620 5791981 One was a large pie-shaped model,<br />probably 14 feet
5792005 5795637 deep, made up of photographs<br />of the larger scale model
5795661 5799340 that was the same scale of the trench<br />that we fly through at the end of the movie.
5800270 5802399 And essentially it was<br />just 8 by 10 black and
5802423 5804720 whites cut out that I<br />would do some marks a lot,
5804880 5807163 little colors and stuff to<br />make it look like what the
5807187 5809406 Death Star should look<br />like based on Rouse designs.
6008610 6010546 The scenes that we call<br />the Armada sequences,
6010570 6012705 when the spaceships are<br />attacking the Death Star,
6013265 6015574 was pretty elaborate,<br />because there were so many
6015598 6017980 ships that had to fly<br />together and choreographed.
6018250 6021920 And then when the X-wings open, each<br />one of the four ships opens their X-wings,
6021960 6024686 that had to be designed so it<br />looked like there was a purpose to it,
6024710 6026840 that they weren't all just<br />randomly crazy pilots.
6026900 6029400 They were all, like,<br />trying to do... work together on this.
6029580 6031016 That was one of the<br />more difficult sequences,
6031040 6034618 because of all the different choreographies<br />of the ships that had to work together.
6034830 6038564 You know, especially the peel-off shot, where<br />one ship after another does a 180-degree
6038588 6040420 flip and dives down<br />to the Death Star.
6040580 6044120 It was one of the more complex<br />motion control moves that I'd ever done.
6147340 6150142 The impression of speed,<br />it's funny if you look at Star Wars now,
6150500 6153227 it seems kind of slow and<br />lethargic compared to each film
6153251 6157090 George kept speeding up the cuts,<br />speeding up the motion of the ships.
6157980 6161490 But for Star Wars, up until that time,<br />nothing had looked that way before.
6162590 6165270 And I think a lot of it came<br />from George using that rough cut,
6165660 6168030 using real footage, documentary footage,
6168920 6171090 and doing cuts like he would in a real film.
6171310 6173638 And some of the cuts we<br />shot were like 12 frames long.
6174670 6179850 And the ships, just for the tempo,<br />George kept everything speeded up.
6179930 6182466 We would shoot the ships so they<br />would blur against the background.
6182490 6184818 That's one of the reasons<br />for doing it motion control.
6185080 6187828 Like one frame every second,<br />something like
6187868 6190010 that,<br />will blur the ships to a certain extent.
6190200 6194090 The background of the trench we shot at,<br />I don't know what the shutter angle was,
6194270 6196370 it was probably something around 250 or 300,
6196690 6198930 to blur it out as it came by camera.
6199185 6201830 So everything had this<br />tremendous sense of motion
6202155 6203880 that kept building through the sequence.
6204110 6206270 And the blur was very important.
6206370 6209630 The streaks from the light<br />passes were very important.
6210240 6211922 The action of the camera was important.
6212055 6213561 It's not just completely locked off,
6213585 6216470 it's doing some barrel rolls and<br />things as the ships fly around.
6217970 6223430 And once we were more adept at that, in<br />each film we kept expanding on those skills.
6224750 6227070 And essentially they're<br />seeing a lot of fast cuts.
6227290 6230670 Again,<br />the sound and the music are very important.
6231290 6235610 Just that tempo that George was building,<br />using these fast, speeded up images,
6235750 6239070 instead of holding lovingly<br />on every effect shot,
6239630 6242205 but hurting the movie,<br />he was just cutting stuff very quick.
6242670 6244027 And we would spend weeks shooting
6244051 6247470 what would amount to about<br />a half a second worth of film,
6247940 6250139 just to get all those pieces<br />he wanted in the shot.
6299600 6302260 When you see some of the<br />X-Wings and TIE ships blow up,
6302900 6306240 one of the simpler techniques<br />was to shoot a TIE ship,
6306420 6308188 for instance, flying against blue screen.
6309120 6311580 Then you would take that element,
6311800 6314128 and at a certain point where<br />you wanted it to explode,
6315110 6317180 you would, basically what we would do is
6317380 6320697 we'd put a piece of acetate over the<br />Moviola and sketch out where the ship was,
6320721 6324420 And then we could base all of our<br />sizes and how to scale everything to that.
6324970 6327522 Then we would take what<br />we called stock explosions,
6327546 6329920 which were explosions<br />shot against blue screen,
6330285 6332656 which was a mistake,<br />but we didn't know it at the time,
6332900 6335401 and shot against black,<br />which was really the way to do it.
6336020 6338146 Again,<br />because some of the edge characteristics
6338170 6340320 against the blue turned<br />out to be very bizarre,
6340480 6345120 and the color saturation went crazy when we<br />tried to use those explosions against blue.
6345220 6346660 It lost a lot of its vibrancy.
6347710 6349940 Then you would just<br />basically take that TIE
6349964 6352480 ship and print the<br />explosion right on top of it,
6352800 6354566 so you're not really blowing the ship up,<br />you're
6354590 6357694 just swooping the explosion on top<br />of your model so you don't destroy it.
6358020 6360089 We did shoot a lot of models blowing up,<br />though.
6360630 6361924 Some of them we actually used.
6362500 6364345 A lot of them we didn't<br />because we weren't
6364369 6366460 shooting quite fast enough<br />speed on the camera.
6367660 6371380 And on the surface of the Death Star,<br />we had some larger pyro things set up,
6371940 6375088 and actually I think<br />Richard was flying this big
6375112 6376661 VistaVision high-speed<br />camera I've never seen before.
6376685 6379832 And he was flying across the model<br />on a cable and setting off explosions.
6380730 6382834 And every once in a while,<br />that camera running
6382858 6384800 at maybe 200 frames<br />a second would jam up.
6385550 6388463 And I've got a photograph at<br />home showing what a beautiful
6388487 6391120 design that is inside a<br />magazine when it goes crazy.
6391180 6394960 I mean, it's just crammed inside a<br />magazine and almost blew the camera apart.
6396390 6399456 The explosions really covered a lot<br />of different ground, supering them on,
6399480 6402400 blowing up real ships<br />against black and against blue.
6537570 6541290 Let's take some of the TIE ship<br />battles at the end of the movie,
6541410 6543590 everyone attacking the<br />X-Wings in the trench.
6544290 6546770 What goes into a shot like<br />that from the very beginning,
6547730 6549455 you, first of all, you have your script.
6549480 6552650 George has a certain<br />requirement that that scene has.
6553780 6557930 You storyboard out the designs of<br />what those shots should look like.
6558530 6563730 What was interesting on Star Wars is that<br />George cut for many of the battle sequences,
6563870 6566090 including the end of the movie, old,
6567320 6571070 bits of film from black and<br />white World War Two films.
6571760 6574590 There's shots like<br />cannons and guns going off.
6574725 6577675 So you see like a black<br />sky and suddenly there's a
6577699 6580170 tremendous explosion<br />where a cannon has gone off.
6580390 6584890 And so we would use those timings for<br />the laser cannons firing down the trench.
6585650 6589970 So once we have the timing, which is roughly<br />again set up by that black and white footage
6590870 6594549 and George's storyboard and just talking to<br />George and what he wants, then we would...
6596130 6600130 set up, say it would have<br />a couple of tie ships in it.
6600770 6604210 And the tie ships are models about,<br />they're varied in scale,
6604470 6606626 but I think the models we<br />used then were probably,
6608330 6611390 I don't know,<br />about 14 or 16 inches high, I believe,
6611620 6615330 for the tie ships and the X-wings<br />were only about two feet long,
6615430 6617499 I believe, foot and a half,<br />something like that.
6618225 6620246 And we would set those<br />up in front of a blue screen,
6620270 6624450 which was a back-lit colored screen,<br />back-lit with fluorescent lights.
6625110 6626066 I can remember speaking to George,
6626090 6629350 spending many nights having<br />to be inside the blue screen
6630370 6633967 and moving the fluorescents,<br />turning them around 180 degrees
6633991 6638430 because after they were on a while,<br />they would polarize essentially and go out.
6638920 6640731 And you had to keep switching them around.
6641620 6642720 So that was a lot of fun.
6643100 6647230 And we would set up a shot, break it<br />down into all the different pieces necessary
6647255 6651710 so we would know, okay, we need<br />a background of the trench, let's say.
6651790 6653901 So that has to be shot<br />with the big trench model
6653925 6655948 we had on stage with<br />the motion control camera.
6656090 6658970 And the camera would move down the trench,
6659520 6663070 probably shooting about a frame a<br />second for the depth of field required.
6664390 6667810 And that would be our background<br />plate we would base everything else on.
6669350 6671894 Into that, we probably needed<br />some stars in the background.
6671920 6673510 So we had a star field set up,
6674160 6676410 which was essentially<br />Plexiglas sprayed black
6677110 6679750 with little pinpricks in it,<br />back-lit with white light
6680000 6681725 so you'd see all the little star shapes.
6682205 6683367 That was shot on the Rama camera.
6683391 6688110 And that would be matched<br />into the background of the trench.
6690200 6693250 And on top of that,<br />once we had some of the background pieces,
6693370 6694922 which usually is the best way to go,
6695510 6698150 because you have to<br />plot in your lighting tricks
6699080 6701550 and your choreography into<br />what the background's doing.
6701690 6705670 So then on top of the background,<br />we would shoot our blue screen X-wings
6706195 6709050 doing what they had to do,<br />which was essentially a two-foot model.
6709710 6711463 If we were looking at the back of it,<br />we would
6711487 6713047 have a pipe coming<br />out of the nose of it,
6713071 6716510 which was a removable nose<br />stuck in what was called a blue pylon,
6717550 6722830 which was essentially a mechanical<br />device that could roll the ship and move it,
6723020 6725987 call it a yaw,<br />which was essentially rotated a little bit
6726011 6729150 based on what we did on the motion<br />control camera using the joystick.
6730700 6732406 And we would shoot blue<br />screen elements with that.
6732430 6733536 We would do lighting tricks.
6733560 6736467 We would flag lights off<br />of the X-wing to look like
6736491 6738610 it was going in and out<br />of shadow on the trench.
6739490 6742710 We would shoot the rocket passes<br />separately so that we could add diffusion.
6743620 6745187 You can't use diffusions against blue screen
6745211 6749647 because it corrupts the<br />soft line of the diffused areas
6749671 6752470 and makes it a hard-edged,<br />staccato-looking, ugly line.
6752685 6754453 So that all had to be shot against black,
6754830 6756339 separate from the blue screen pass,
6757440 6760470 to give it that nice, soft-edged<br />look that the rockets wanted to have.
6761260 6762986 And that's how all these shots broke down.
6763010 6765590 So you'd have a light shot of the X-wing,
6766110 6769226 then you would shut off the blue screen<br />and do all your light passes separately,
6769250 6771287 which can consist of<br />a lot of different passes
6771311 6773847 for all the different<br />diffusions and exposures
6773871 6775854 you want to use for<br />how the light should look.
6777120 6779667 Then the TIE ships<br />would be also shot against
6779691 6781671 blue screen with<br />different lighting effects.
6782310 6785421 As you're shooting them,<br />you would shoot a piece
6785445 6789390 of film roughly designed<br />as much as you can get it
6789565 6790887 the first go-around on the camera
6790911 6793799 with using the joystick and the<br />computerized motion control camera.
6794790 6796690 You would load up with something called RAR,
6797030 6801110 which is Rapid Access Recovery Film,<br />which is some military term
6801310 6804567 for some black and white stock<br />that can easily be developed
6804591 6808330 in just a few minutes in a PROSTAR machine,<br />it's called.
6808980 6809930 So you take the black and white film,
6810070 6812935 go into the PROSTAR,<br />develop it, look at it on a Moviola,
6813960 6816470 and if the action was what you wanted,
6816530 6818436 then you could go ahead<br />and shoot all your color passes.
6818460 6820146 If it wasn't right,<br />you would have to go back
6820170 6823231 and start correcting it so it would<br />work in with the rest of the ships.
6823730 6826450 And you could bi-pack two<br />or three of these elements
6826625 6830860 on a Moviola, which were built<br />specifically for us, eight perf Moviolas,
6830920 6833076 because we shot everything<br />eight perf for quality.
6833590 6836250 And you could basically see how the action
6837110 6839090 related to the other ships in the shot,
6839255 6840807 so everything was working correctly.
6841910 6843746 And if you tried bi-packing more than that,
6843770 6846443 it usually would shred all your<br />film and you could start over.
6847030 6848798 And that's sort of how it all broke down.
6864190 6866760 A large Death Star model<br />blowing it up in bits and pieces,
6866900 6868577 and then finally the<br />big explosion at the end
6868601 6872280 was a large explosion against black,<br />shot zero gravity,
6872420 6874619 which essentially is a<br />camera shooting straight up,
6875090 6877957 so when the explosion goes off,<br />you don't have a sense of the sparks
6877981 6883000 and debris falling down towards,<br />you know, gravity towards the ground,
6883080 6886480 so it all spreads out evenly around<br />the lens, shot at very high speed.
6887390 6891107 And that was again supered on top of the<br />Death Star instead of blowing it up for real.
6894210 6896177 Most of the final composites of the scenes
6896201 6898777 were done at the very<br />end of the entire schedule
6898801 6902380 and came out, I think,<br />in just a matter of a few weeks
6902580 6903680 at the end of the show.
6903850 6905804 So we really didn't have<br />any idea how the shots
6905828 6908047 were looking until virtually<br />when the film was done.
6908610 6911197 And what we saw in the theatre<br />sure didn't seem anything like
6911221 6913277 what we'd worked on,<br />because it had a great score
6913301 6917486 and everything was just working on it, and<br />it was like seeing a whole different movie.
6918020 6920380 I recognized the shots,<br />but couldn't relate to it.
6920460 6921100 It was a real...
6921200 6921896 I'm not sure.
6921920 6922300 It was an odd feeling.
6922650 6924633 Also,<br />I was sick with pneumonia when I saw it,
6924860 6926024 so I was kind of in a daze.
6926400 6927720 And I think if I hadn't been,
6927840 6929565 I may have been a little more up for it.
6931625 6932725 When Star Wars came out,
6933130 6935917 that feeling that Dennis<br />and I had while working on it
6935941 6939480 with seeing the rough cuts<br />and seeing some of the...
6939730 6942780 I mean, some of our work<br />looked like junk that we were doing,
6943120 6945491 that we didn't know if we<br />had time to refine it or not.
6946580 6947860 So the day finally comes.
6948780 6951108 It's the premiere of Star<br />Wars at the Academy Theatre,
6951640 6954399 for the crew, and George and<br />every one of the actors were there.
6955085 6957973 Dennis and I were sitting next to<br />each other, and Phil and the gang,
6958000 6960440 and it starts to come up,
6960555 6961892 and we just look at each other,
6962430 6963240 and we still didn't know.
6963360 6966000 We had no idea what we were about to see,
6966060 6968456 and we just sat there,<br />and we were a little worried that...
6968480 6970006 Well, it shows how stupid we were, I guess,
6970030 6973720 but we just hoped all that effort<br />had been put to some good use.
6973920 6975903 And then it started off,<br />and what was great is
6976190 6979617 George ran the Duck Dodgers'<br />Chuck Jones cartoon first,
6979641 6982300 and so everyone was having<br />a great time and laughing,
6983250 6985500 and the film came on,<br />and when that film was over,
6987260 6990420 everyone, I can only describe<br />it as everyone was in shock.
6991080 6993880 Everyone was stunned, absolutely speechless.
6995480 6996580 Lights came up.
6996940 7000300 None of us had a clue that we had<br />been involved with something like that.
7001050 7004740 We were very excited about<br />having been a part of such a thing,
7005510 7007716 especially excited because<br />we didn't know it was that thing.
7007740 7009680 I don't think anyone<br />knew it was what it was.
7009940 7013220 I don't even know if George knew<br />the reaction anyone would have on it.
7014050 7016080 It was really exciting. It was great.
7016310 7018140 I've never experienced something like it.
7018200 7019836 I mean,<br />that was the first feature I ever worked on,
7019860 7021900 and it was the greatest sensation,<br />seeing that.
7022730 7024584 It was amazing. I mean, everyone came away,
7024980 7027056 everyone who saw the film<br />came away with the same thing,
7027080 7030737 because George utilized<br />visuals and sound effects
7030761 7033280 and the music in a way<br />that had never been done,
7033820 7037080 but aspects of it had been<br />done 30 or 40 years earlier,
7037140 7040620 and some of that great old-fashioned<br />dynamics of that kind of movie-making,
7041120 7042700 people hadn't seen in a long time,
7043490 7045689 and that's part I think,<br />of the appeal of the film.
7045750 7048640 It's sort of a lot of old-fashioned moments
7049970 7051953 designed into the science<br />fiction environment,
7052535 7055340 done with impeccable tastes and panache,
7055500 7057182 and he just carried it out beautifully.
