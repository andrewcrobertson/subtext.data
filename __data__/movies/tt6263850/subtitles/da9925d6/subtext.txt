1412687 1415558 Can you imagine<br />if you were the Anchor Being?
1415558 1417626 - [Deadpool, dully] Yeah.<br />- [laughs] Oh!
1417626 1421201 - Yeah.<br />- No, it isn’t you, Mr. Wilson.
1421201 1422334 Your Anchor Being died
1422334 1425568 in an act<br />of self-sacrifice so epic
1425568 1428142 that it sent shivers<br />down the Timeline.
1428142 1432146 I am referring,<br />of course, to...
1432773 1437250 Logan. The Wolverine.
1439483 1442882 [weakly] Don’t be<br />what they made you.

1458865 1460372 Of course.
1460603 1462033 Logan.
1463034 1464244 [Deadpool groans]
1464244 1465509 [yelling] Logan?
1465509 1467412 The guy with forks for hands?
1467412 1469975 - That Wolverine?<br />- [device beeps]
1469975 1471680 Yeah, I got it.<br />You can turn your
1471680 1474122 retro graphics of death<br />off now. Make it stop.
1474122 1475849 We’re not doing it,<br />Mr. Wilson.
1475849 1477884 We certainly can’t stop it.
1478951 1480018 [Deadpool]<br />How long have we got?
1480018 1482724 In most cases,<br />couple thousand years.
1482724 1483989 - Well, sweet.<br />- Well, most cases
1483989 1486497 aren’t fast enough.<br />Not for me.
1486497 1487663 [Deadpool]<br />What does that mean?
1487663 1489698 It means<br />that I have been tasked
1489698 1492569 with overseeing<br />the end of your universe.
1492569 1493339 And regardless of what
1493339 1495671 the pencil pushers upstairs<br />would prefer,
1495671 1496243 I will not
1496243 1499807 waste my life watching it die<br />slowly of natural causes.
1499807 1502040 We used to just prune<br />these things. Simple.
1502040 1504042 Elegant. Efficient.<br />But I’m told the TVA
1504042 1506484 doesn’t like to do that<br />anymore. Well, I do.
1506484 1508453 And no matter what<br />my so-called superiors say,
1508453 1511522 the multiverse does not<br />need a babysitter.
1511522 1513194 We need a mercy killer.
1513194 1514855 And in this instance,
1514855 1518859 I am the mercy killer. Ha!
1519662 1521169 [chuckles]

1527967 1530739 Once completed,<br />it will allow me to destroy
1530739 1532741 the spacetime matrix<br />of your universe.
1532741 1535546 You see, I don’t want<br />to work for the TVA.
1535546 1536778 I want to be the TVA.
1536778 1539946 And the first step involves<br />showing this organization
1539946 1541717 how much more efficient<br />it can become.
1541717 1543851 To wit, I will be<br />giving your universe
1543851 1545952 a swift and compassionate end.
1545952 1547459 And don’t worry, your friends<br />won’t feel a thing.
1547459 1551661 It’ll be over just like this.<br />"Oh, what’s that?" [groans]

1570878 1573078 Look, Mr. Wilson,<br />you have two choices.
1573078 1574618 You can either rejoin<br />your loved ones
1574618 1576884 and collectively cease<br />to exist in,
1576884 1579788 I’d say, 72 hours. Or...
1579788 1582054 you join the Sacred Timeline.
1582054 1585057 And you end your days<br />of insignificance
1585057 1587433 and mediocrity.

1997744 2001176 some things are just<br />beyond forgiveness.
2003046 2003541 Okay.
2003541 2006786 How do I... How do I make<br />this right? I’ll do anything.
2006786 2009613 I gave you<br />a chance at greatness.
2009613 2012451 Because my superiors<br />deemed you "special."
2012451 2014255 Clearly not special<br />in a good way.

2017522 2018666 With Thor. He holds me.
2018666 2020030 But I did my duty.
2020030 2022197 I gave you the opportunity<br />to be somebody.
2022197 2023968 And instead of<br />accepting my offering
2023968 2027037 with humility and gratitude,<br />you broke my nose.
2027037 2027774 [sighs] It looks great.
2027774 2029776 And you decimated<br />dozens of my men
2029776 2031107 with the exhumed corpse<br />of a hero.

2893606 2894871 or my friend here<br />is gonna sing
2894871 2897170 the entire second act<br />of Music Man
2897170 2898974 with zero warm-up.
2898974 2900008 Where’d you get the chair?
2900008 2901108 [Cassandra Nova]<br />Well, once in a while,
2901108 2903506 I do get a Charles<br />through here.
2903506 2904782 Never mine, though.
2904782 2907587 No. He didn’t care to find me.
2907587 2910986 [Deadpool groans] Gen Z<br />and their trauma-bragging!
2910986 2914561 Can’t you just stuff it down,<br />turn it into accomplishment
2914561 2916156 or cancer like the rest of us?
2916156 2918092 But I’m not like<br />the rest of you.
2918092 2919698 Except maybe the Wolverine.
2919698 2922833 Now, we could be<br />truly terrifying together.
2922833 2923999 You’re that scary, huh?
2923999 2926067 The TVA certainly thought so.
2926067 2928806 They sent me here<br />before I could walk.
2928806 2930577 And you know,<br />it’s the best thing
2930577 2932612 that ever happened to me.
2932612 2933206 I love it here.
2933206 2934372 [Deadpool] You live<br />in a garbage dump.
2934372 2938145 I think we both know who lives<br />in the garbage dump.
2938145 2939619 The Void is a paradise.
2939619 2943722 I can wield my power here<br />without shame.
2943722 2946153 Unfortunately I had<br />no Charles Xavier
2946153 2948155 to teach me temperance.
2948155 2950157 What about your Charles?
2950157 2951994 Did he protect you?
2951994 2953996 Did he make you feel safe?
2953996 2955965 We’re mutants.<br />We’re never safe.
2955965 2959133 - [roars]<br />- [Cassandra whoops]
2959133 2960805 [chuckles]
2960805 2962268 [whoops]
2963841 2965073 [Deadpool] Whoa, whoa,<br />whoa, whoa, whoa!
2965073 2966877 I don’t...<br />I don’t want the smoke.
2966877 2968043 I don’t have<br />any beef with you.
2968043 2969880 I just want<br />to save my friends.
2969880 2970815 I just... I want to go home.
2970815 2972982 Well, the thing is,<br />I could get you home.
2972982 2974687 - Good.<br />- But I don’t want to.
2974687 2977921 [Deadpool] Not good.<br />[groaning]
2979483 2981584 What do you want, Wade Wilson?
2981584 2984730 [Deadpool straining] Your...<br />fingers are inside me,
2984730 2985489 but not in a good way.
2985489 2988833 My brother could enter<br />one’s mind with a thought.
2988833 2991000 I have to get my hands dirty.
2991000 2994300 - [Deadpool groaning]<br />- [shushing]
2994465 2996302 I’ve got you.
2997809 3000042 [whispers] I’ve got you...
3001406 3003683 [Wade, muffled]<br />What do you mean?
3004079 3007654 I can’t... I can’t reach you.<br />You’re not here.
3007654 3008688 I’m right here.
3008688 3011856 - No, you’re not. I can’t...<br />- I’m right here.
3011856 3015090 Then show me.<br />You got to do something.
3015761 3016520 Show you what?
3016520 3020326 Show me you care about<br />something bigger than you.
3020326 3025562 Ever since they turned you<br />down, you took a knee.
3025562 3028334 Baby, you never got back up.
3029467 3031568 I know you’re<br />going through something.
3031568 3033845 Let me go through it with you.
3033845 3037717 - Your crazy matches my crazy.<br />- Your crazy matches my crazy.
3040280 3042084 Where’d you go?
3042084 3044185 [Wade] Oh, my God.
3044614 3046484 [♪ melancholy music playing]
3046484 3048860 You just say it. Okay?
3048860 3049894 Say, "I don’t want you.
3049894 3051830 "I don’t want to be with you."
3051830 3053590 Go ahead. Say it.<br />Say... Say, "I don’t..."
3053590 3054932 Say it.<br />You don’t wanna be with me.
3054932 3056769 Tell me that<br />and I’ll walk away.
3056769 3057660 Say, "I don’t want you."
3057660 3060938 [♪ melancholy music continues]
3064238 3065668 [sighs] Fuck...
3065668 3069111 You’ll never fucking matter.
3072576 3073643 What?
3073643 3076756 - You’ll never fucking matter.<br />- Fucking matter.
3076756 3080056 [♪ melancholy music continues]
3082322 3085490 - [Vanessa] You’ll...<br />- [Cassandra] You’ll...
3085490 3087360 - never...<br />- never...
3087360 3088658 - fucking...<br />- fucking...
3088658 3092332 - matter.<br />- matter...
3093399 3094906 [Deadpool]<br />She never said that.
3094906 3095808 - [Cassandra] No.<br />- [groans]
3095808 3098173 [in mocking tone]<br />But I bet she thought it.
3098173 3098910 [Deadpool splutters]
3098910 3101638 [Deadpool groans]<br />You are so mean!
3101638 3103079 My brain could taste<br />your fingers,
3103079 3104751 and they tasted like hate!
3104751 3107952 And where in God’s name<br />is the intimacy coordinator?
3107952 3110757 You’re so lost, Mr. Wilson.
3110757 3113991 And long before you came here.
3114717 3115454 This is Baby Knife.
3115454 3117093 She’s gonna fuck you<br />in the face now.
3117093 3117863 If you want to kill me,
3117863 3120129 it’s going to take<br />more than a little blade.
3120129 3121658 [Deadpool] How about six?
3121658 3125838 [laughs mockingly]<br />My boy’s wicked strong.
3125838 3127565 That’s my big boy.
3127565 3129237 Yes, you are.
3129237 3130909 [groans]
3131173 3132779 [laughs]
3134671 3135980 [Cassandra]<br />Well, this has been fun.
3135980 3138576 But the big guy needs to eat,<br />and the rent is due.
3138576 3141315 - [eerie roar]<br />- [thunder roaring]
3142448 3143515 By the way,
3143515 3145022 you’re the rent.
3145022 3147717 [rumbling]
3155032 3156759 [roars]
3159432 3161137 [henchmen screaming]

3168078 3169915 [Deadpool] Coming!
3179155 3182323 [engine sputtering<br />in distance]
3183995 3186657 - [distant scream]<br />- [engine bursts]
3186657 3187999 [grunting]
3187999 3189198 [both groan]
3189198 3189968 What you thinkin’ ’bout?
3189968 3191563 - Get the fuck off of me!<br />- Shh, shh, shh.
3191563 3193697 - [strains] Almost done.<br />- Almost done what?
3193697 3195908 Getting my knife out<br />of your buttocks,
3195908 3197668 - pervert!<br />- Aah! Fuck!
3197668 3199406 Get your mind out of my pants!
3199406 3202574 - I’m telling Blake.<br />- New rules.
3202574 3203179 I talk now.
3203179 3204950 That’s gonna be very hard<br />on the audience.
3204950 3207513 Shut the fuck up!
3207513 3208283 Let me fuckin’ think.
3208283 3211319 Now we gotta get back<br />to Paradox, right?
3212815 3213585 Right?
3213585 3216489 Je m’excuse. Am I allowed<br />to speak now or--
3216489 3219393 Just nod, asshole.
3220625 3221131 Right.
3221131 3222462 Then we find the others<br />that poor kid, Johnny,
3222462 3223903 was talking about<br />before you got him killed!
3223903 3225795 [Deadpool] "Poor kid."<br />He’s, like, 50!
3225795 3226829 Yeah, if there’s<br />a chance they know
3226829 3228402 how to get out of here,<br />we find ’em.
3228402 3230734 And make those TVA fuckers<br />fix my shit
3230734 3232076 like you fucking promised!
3232076 3233836 [Deadpool] I smell quest.
3233836 3235838 [sniffing]
3236542 3238115 I smell food.
3239842 3244924 So what made you finally wear<br />an honest-to-God costume?
3245386 3247421 Mine’s red<br />so they can’t see me bleed.
3247421 3250556 But I could see how<br />yellow would be useful too.
3250556 3252789 Have you been checked<br />for ADHD?
3252789 3253757 Mm-mm.
3253757 3255693 But I’ve had several STDs,
3255693 3258432 which were probably caused<br />by ADHD.
3258432 3259939 Fuck!
3260071 3262007 What are you looking for?
3262007 3263976 Oh. Thank fuck.
3263976 3265945 No, no, no, no, no.<br />That’s rubbing alcohol.
3265945 3267705 You don’t want to drink--<br />Oh, yeah.
3267705 3269839 There you go. Fuck that liver.
3269839 3270675 [exhales]
3270675 3273282 - Good. Okay.<br />- [sighs]
3273645 3275416 What the fuck are those?
3275647 3276120 Oh.
3276120 3278122 Back in civilian life,<br />I wear a toupee,
3278122 3280157 but nobody knows. [chuckles]
3280157 3281928 [laughing]
3282522 3284656 Everybody knows.
3286097 3287461 Wanna talk about<br />what’s haunting you,
3287461 3290266 or should we wait<br />for a third act flashback?
3290266 3293038 Ah... Go fuck yourself.
3295766 3297306 You know...
3297834 3301211 in my world, you’re...<br />[clears throat]
3301739 3303015 You’re well regarded.
3303015 3305281 Yeah, well, not in mine.
3305281 3307679 They don’t like me much<br />in mine either.
3307679 3308614 You don’t say.
3308614 3311683 I wanted to be something,<br />you know. I...
3311683 3313553 Shit, I wanted<br />to be an Avenger.
3313553 3315489 - Fuck the Avengers.<br />- Yeah.
3315489 3319097 I didn’t make the cut, though.<br />Same with the X-Men...
3320164 3321033 When my girlfriend left me,
3321033 3323596 - and I just--<br />- You had a girlfriend?
3323596 3325070 Yeah.
3325070 3326038 Vanessa.
3326038 3328403 When we met, she was a dancer.
3328898 3330768 We had a whole life.
3331472 3332803 It was good.
3332803 3335839 But, oh, boy, I just... Mwah.
3336213 3338710 Fucked that right up.
3339018 3339942 But you,
3339942 3340877 you were an X-Man.
3340877 3344023 Fuck that.<br />You were the X-Man. You...
3345189 3347092 The Wolverine.
3348621 3351030 He was a hero in my world.
3352229 3353956 Yeah, well...
3354429 3356266 he ain’t shit in mine.
3360567 3364307 You said, "Logan was a hero."<br />What happened?
3364802 3366210 He died.
3366474 3366936 How?
3366936 3369873 Well, technically,<br />you were chest-fucked<br />by a tree, but,
3369873 3371776 really, you just<br />ran out of batteries
3371776 3373877 - trying to save someone.<br />- Who?
3373877 3376088 The shitheels<br />that grew her in a lab
3376088 3378387 called her "X-23." But...
3378519 3379619 she was just a kid.
3379619 3383788 A younger, daintier,<br />somehow meaner version of you.
3383788 3385757 You died trying to save her.
3385757 3386725 It was beautiful.
3386725 3389662 Look, mijo,<br />I know you’re hurtin’.
3389662 3391928 My blind, elderly,<br />African-American roommate,
3391928 3395437 Blind Al, always says that<br />pain teaches us who we are.
3395437 3397472 Sometimes we need to listen<br />to that pain
3397472 3398374 instead of running from it.
3398374 3399738 - Holy shit.<br />- Yeah, she’s wise.
3399738 3403005 No, no, no. That’s her name?<br />You call her "Blind Al"?
3403005 3404710 Well, she’s blind.

3575551 3578488 You’re gonna have to<br />give me my dog back, though.
3578488 3579621 [Deadpool] I know. Listen.
3579621 3580721 - [Dogpool whimpers]<br />- Yes, child.
3580721 3583460 If you ever wanna give her up,<br />or if she needs a new home,
3583460 3585858 or if something<br />should happen to you,
3585858 3586595 I’d love to be her papa.
3586595 3589400 [laughs] What would<br />ever happen to me?
3589400 3591303 [Deadpool] Lots of stuff.
3594130 3595472 - Jesus.<br />- [Deadpool] No!
3595472 3596704 We’re running away. [grunts]
3596704 3598904 - [Wolverine] Give me that.<br />- The corn was too dense, girl!

3632938 3634742 First thing I did<br />when I flamed out,
3634742 3635941 - I took mine off.<br />- Drop it.
3635941 3636843 [Deadpool] It’s not that ugly.

4079483 4080891 just really,<br />really want them to,

4084620 4088096 You know, we never had<br />a Wolverine up in here.
4088096 4088866 But I can tell you now,
4088866 4090769 it’s just a common courtesy<br />to ask
4090769 4092496 before you drink up<br />all of my liquor.
4092496 4095070 Well, it’s a good thing<br />I don’t give a fuck.

4105476 4106543 Well, now that<br />that’s settled, look,
4106543 4107786 we came a long way<br />to find you three.

4110052 4111680 Hey, wait. Is it Magneto?
4111680 4113990 Dear sweet God in heaven,<br />let it be Magneto,
4113990 4115057 - because with him--<br />- He’s dead.

4116927 4119028 It’s like Pinocchio jammed<br />his face in my ass

4133779 4135077 So who brought us here?

4152798 4155361 She’s the one<br />I told you about.
4158628 4161169 Hey, how did you all get stuck<br />in The Void?
4161169 4162698 There was a knock at the door.
4162698 4164909 - TVA sent me here.<br />- Me, too.
4164909 4165767 Well, maybe I was born here.
4165767 4167109 It’s... It’s hard<br />to know for sure.
4167109 4170475 TVA decided<br />our universe was dying.
4170475 4173819 And I never even got a chance<br />to fight for it.
4175381 4177680 [Elektra] People like us<br />don’t go quietly.
4177680 4179858 TVA knows that,<br />so they took us out.
4179858 4182388 [smooches]<br />The answer is yes. I’m in.
4182388 4184159 - In what?<br />- [Deadpool] A team.
4184159 4186491 Me, you, you, and me.<br />All of us together.
4186491 4187789 Let’s get the fuck<br />out of this place.
4187789 4189758 Don’t listen to him.<br />He’s a fucking liar!
4189758 4191727 [Deadpool]<br />It was an educated wish!
4191727 4194169 - Ha!<br />- [Deadpool] Look.
4194532 4196468 We’ve been inside<br />Cassandra’s lair.
4196468 4199075 The only way out of The Void<br />is through her.
4199075 4201044 She can get us home.<br />She told us.
4201044 4203475 Wait a minute,<br />you’ve been inside?
4203475 4205114 - And you made it out alive?<br />- Bullshit.
4205114 4207017 - Nobody’s ever done that.<br />- [Deadpool] We did.
4207017 4210581 Every time one of us<br />has gone up against her,
4210581 4211153 they die.
4211153 4213859 The Punisher, the Quicksilver,<br />the Daredevil.
4213859 4215652 [Deadpool] Daredevil?<br />I’m so sorry.
4215652 4218028 - It’s fine.<br />- [Deadpool] Okay.
4218820 4222527 Even that sweet, baby angel,<br />Johnny Storm.
4222527 4224133 He up and gone missing like,
4224133 4225937 what, two days ago?
4225937 4227796 [Deadpool] Ugh. That’s so sad.
4227796 4231206 Wherever this Johnny fella is,<br />I’m sure he’s thriving.
4231206 4231943 [Wolverine chuckles]
4231943 4234770 Look, there’s...<br />there’s strength in numbers.
4234770 4235441 All right? Us...
4235441 4236508 plus, you guys.<br />We can put Cassandra
4236508 4238983 over our knee and force her<br />to let us out of The Void.
4238983 4240743 I know what it means<br />to feel self-doubt.
4240743 4241986 - I don’t feel that at all.<br />- I’m good.
4241986 4244384 [Deadpool] Gnawing at your gut<br />like a coked-up tapeworm.
4244384 4246056 It’s like you’re holding up<br />a mirror to my soul.
4246056 4247926 [Deadpool] You guys<br />may not have been able
4247926 4249686 to save your universes.
4249686 4251589 But you can avenge them.
4251589 4253195 It’s what Johnny<br />would have wanted.
4253195 4256902 Wait. You knew Johnny?
4257034 4257969 [chuckles] Oh, yeah.
4257969 4259597 Dickhead here talked him<br />into a team-up,
4259597 4262435 and Johnny came down with<br />a little case of the deads.
4262435 4263667 [Deadpool] No, no, no.<br />We don’t know that.
4263667 4266043 It was just a flesh wound.<br />He may have survived.
4266043 4268837 If he survived that,<br />he is prayin’ for death.
4268837 4270509 [Deadpool] Thank you,<br />Doctor Wolverine!
4270509 4272918 - Spill it!<br />- What’d you do to Johnny, huh?

4273985 4276713 [Deadpool] Okay. Okay.<br />Hey, hey, hey.
4276713 4277285 Look.
4277285 4279683 He ran his fat-ass mouth<br />about Cassandra.
4279683 4281058 Then she zip-zapped his skin,
4281058 4283027 leaving his organs to splash<br />crudely onto the ground
4283027 4286657 while the soil<br />greedily drank his blood.<br />It was horrible.

4287790 4291332 Look, he died before he could<br />make a difference. But...
4291332 4292795 - [laughs]<br />- Look, maybe you couldn’t
4292795 4293939 save your worlds, but...
4293939 4296535 but Jesus Christ,<br />you can save mine!
4296535 4298801 I don’t give a shit<br />about your world, but
4298801 4302112 if these two made it out of<br />there alive, maybe together,
4302112 4303806 we can get back in<br />and take her down.
4303806 4306875 Where I come from,<br />we call that suicide, Chere.
4306875 4309152 [Deadpool] If we can block<br />her psychic powers,
4309152 4311220 we can get a leg up.<br />I know it.
4311220 4312958 Now, I know Magneto’s dead.
4312958 4315356 But I’d venture to guess<br />that his helmet is lying
4315356 4317655 - around here somewhere--<br />- Cassandra melted the helmet.
4317655 4318964 - [Deadpool] Fuck!<br />- After she killed him.
4318964 4320823 - [Deadpool] Fuck!<br />- She don’t play.
4320823 4322396 She knows that helmet<br />was the only way
4322396 4323859 to protect anyone<br />from her powers.
4323859 4326202 The only other helmet that<br />strong is Juggernaut’s,
4326202 4327071 but he works for Cassandra.
4327071 4328435 [Deadpool]<br />Juggernaut’s helmet.<br />That’s it.
4328435 4330371 Yeah, and we done be knowing<br />that lid ain’t comin’ off
4330371 4331977 without that dome<br />gonna come off wit’it.
4331977 4333473 [Deadpool] I’m so sorry, beautiful.

4336179 4340711 I feel like we are missing<br />critical exposition here.
4340711 4344814 I’m sick of this shit.<br />I’m sick of hiding.

4438149 4440217 You might not know it,<br />but apparently,
4440217 4442285 I’m the worst Logan.
4443121 4446014 I got to have a life<br />because of you.
4447983 4450656 I got to grow up<br />because of you.
4452020 4453098 A lot of kids did.
4453098 4456365 A lot of kids didn’t grow up<br />because of me.
4457762 4460171 Trust me, kid, I’m no hero.
4460732 4462701 That suit says different.
4462701 4465737 - Yeah. Do you like it?<br />- Mm.
4466606 4469312 Scott used to beg me<br />to wear it.
4470808 4474185 So did Jean, Storm, Beast.
4475714 4476946 All of them.
4476946 4480818 They wanted me to be part<br />of the team, but I wouldn’t.
4480818 4485394 Told ’em they all look<br />fucking ridiculous. I mean...
4485922 4489959 I couldn’t have ’em thinkin’<br />I wanted to be there.
4494436 4497065 And then one day,<br />while I was off on my own,
4497065 4498869 the humans came...
4498869 4500970 and went mutant hunting.
4501542 4502807 I can guess the rest.
4502807 4504644 No, no, let me...
4505216 4507075 Let me say it. I...
4509044 4510881 I need to say it.
4512080 4515523 By the time I stumbled home<br />shitfaced from the bar,
4515523 4517360 it was too late.
4520121 4522827 They were dead. Every...<br />[stifling sob]

4605844 4606878 Good. All right. Phew.

5276954 5278021 if he knew where you were,
5278021 5280815 he would’ve torn a hole<br />in the fucking universe
5280815 5282685 to bring you home.
5285820 5287426 This is my home.
5287426 5290858 Well, then at least<br />let us save his.

6770875 6771645 Because I was assured
6771645 6774043 that she was safely held<br />in The Void. But no,
6774043 6775979 she was here.<br />And she fondled my brain.
6775979 6778718 - How did you let this happen?<br />- You weren’t involved at all?
6778718 6781787 In stopping her, yes!<br />Yes, I was.
6781787 6782722 But not nearly enough.
6782722 6786429 Not as much as the men<br />who went down there after her.
6786759 6788222 My men.
6788497 6790026 My friends.
6790763 6791390 I warned them.
6791390 6793194 That they would be completely<br />obliterated if they went.
6793194 6795768 But they went anyway. Like...
6796868 6797968 Like heroes.
6797968 6799739 [♪ somber music playing]
6799739 6802302 Because that’s who they were.
6803974 6806746 They just did<br />what they had to do.
6806845 6809749 With no concern<br />for their own safety.
6811916 6815689 The fact that we are<br />all still standing here
6815689 6819418 is a testament<br />to their heroism.
6821992 6823763 Anyway, there’s nothing<br />you or I can do
6823763 6825666 to bring them back now.
6826161 6828834 [Deadpool] He has risen,<br />baby girl.

6926932 6929363 I wanna show you something.
6929902 6930496 Something huge.
6930496 6933708 [Deadpool] That’s what<br />Scoutmaster Kevin used to say.
6934676 6935974 Do you see that?
6935974 6938680 Your universe is regenerating.
6938845 6940506 Whatever you did here,
6940506 6942684 you not only saved your world.
6942684 6946182 You spared your timeline<br />from extinction.
6947513 6948118 I’d rest up.
6948118 6950725 I have a feeling your work<br />is only just getting started.

6953552 6954421 Wait! Um...
6954421 6958293 We couldn’t have made it out<br />of The Void without some help
6958293 6961901 from some people<br />that the world kind of...
6961901 6962495 kind of forgot.
6962495 6965740 Is there any way that<br />you could maybe find a way
6965740 6967742 to bring them home?
6968677 6969469 I’ll see what I can do.
6969469 6972142 [Deadpool] And, um,<br />I promised my friend here
6972142 6975508 that the TVA could undo<br />some pretty awful shit
6975508 6976146 in his timeline.
6976146 6977917 What would you say to that?
6977917 6978852 Change the past?
6978852 6981118 [Deadpool] Well, he did<br />help me save the world.
6981118 6984759 And his past made him<br />the man who did it.
6984759 6988158 There’s nothing to fix,<br />Mr. Wilson.

7611550 7613750 you’re either food for Alioth
