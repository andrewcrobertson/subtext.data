35473 39522 <i>That logo music just gets you pumped.<br />Right?</i>
39689 42402 <i>I'm sorry. I just, I'm excited<br />to be here. It's been a while.</i>
42569 45407 <i>You know, for a long time,<br />I wasn't sure I'd ever be back.</i>
45574 46533 <i>Disney bought Fox...</i>
46701 49455 <i>there was a whole boring rights issue,<br />blabbity-blabbity-blah.</i>
49621 52376 <i>But then, it turned out, they wanted me.</i>
52543 54964 <i>The one guy<br />who shouldn't even have his own movie...</i>
55130 56717 <i>much less a franchise.</i>
57259 59387 <i>Marvel's so stupid.</i>
60139 62142 <i>Look, we know the title of this thing. So...</i>
62309 63644 <i>I know what you're wondering.</i>
63812 67651 <i>How are we gonna do this<br />without dishonoring Logan's memory?</i>
68277 69488 <i>And I'll tell you how.</i>
70615 71449 <i>We're not.</i>
73452 75456 <i>I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.</i>
75623 77877 <i>Wolverine is not dead.</i>
78043 81007 <i>Sure, it made for a perfect ending<br />to a very sad story.</i>
81215 84345 <i>But that's not how<br />regenerative healing factors work.</i>
84513 87893 <i>You think I wanna be out here<br />in beautiful downtown North Dakota...</i>
88059 90898 <i>digging up the one and only Wolverine?<br />No, thank you.</i>
91357 93694 <i>But the fate of my entire world is at stake.</i>
93861 98577 <i>He may not be living his best life,<br />but he sure as hell ain't dead.</i>
104086 105087 Bingo.
105881 106882 Yahtzee.
110180 113059 Yes, yes, yes.
116648 117650 Damn it!
118735 121364 Son of a bitch!
123159 124244 You...
126707 129962 Christ. Motherfucker!
130128 131673 My world is fuck...
132842 134135 That was weird.
134636 136013 I'm much calmer now.
137265 140104 Look, I'm not a man of science.
140270 142899 But you seem incredibly passed away.
146697 148242 But it's good to see ya.
148408 151330 I gotta be honest,<br />I've always wanted to ride with you, Log.
151497 156463 You and me getting into it.<br />Deadpool and Wolverine just fuckin' shit up.
156631 159802 Can you imagine the fun, the chaos...
159969 160929 the residuals?
162140 163182 "G'day, mate.
163350 165019 "There's nothing that'll<br />bring me back to life faster...
165186 167649 "than a big bag of Marvel cash."
169443 170486 Me too, Hugh.
171237 173449 But, no. No, no, no.
175036 179793 You had to get all noble and die for real.<br />Goddamn it!
181504 183591 I could really use your help right now.
194693 195527 Wait!
196696 198324 I'm warning you, I'm not alone.
198490 199951 Wade Winston Wilson...
200703 203415 you are under arrest<br />by the Time Variance Authority...
203582 205418 for too many crimes to list.
205586 206420 Come out...
206587 207923 and we'll extend you the courtesy...
208090 210176 - of taking you in one piece.<br />- Death by day-player.
210343 211261 Last chance.
211679 214475 Throw out your weapons<br />and come out peacefully.
215101 216937 I'm not gonna give you my weapons...
217105 219149 but I promise not to use them.
220193 222822 There are two hundred and six bones<br />in the human body.
222989 225159 Two hundred and seven<br />if I'm watching <i>Gossip Girl.</i>
226119 228081 Here we go. Maximum effort.
235426 238180 Okay, peanut.<br />Guess we're getting that team up after all.
308295 310132 Maradona from outside the box!
310591 312677 {\an8}Goal!
360380 361632 Come on, big fella.
400780 403200 I am soaking wet right now.
406497 408501 <i>To be clear, I'm not proud of any of this.</i>
408668 412549 <i>The wanton violence,<br />the whiff of necrophilia. It isn't who I am.</i>
412716 414052 <i>It isn't who I wanna be.</i>
414218 415470 <i>Who I wanna be?</i>
415637 417223 <i>Well, to help you understand that...</i>
417390 418434 <i>I've gotta take you back.</i>
418600 421189 <i>A little joyride I took<br />through space and time...</i>
421355 423901 <i>to the day that changed everything.</i>
436046 437674 {\an8}I can't believe I'm finally here.
437841 440386 {\an8}I've waited for this moment for so long.
441722 443851 Thank you, sir, for seeing me.
444935 446813 I firmly believe...
446981 448274 that my services could be of...
448441 451196 great use to your organization.<br />Now I know...
451363 453658 I was caught smashturbating<br />in the lobby of Stark Tower...
453825 455035 - but I can assure you that...<br />- Smashturbating?
455202 456454 I'm sorry, what, what was that?
456622 459835 No, I'm sorry.<br />That, that's when you get those toy...
460002 462672 Hulk hands, right? And then you just,<br />you look down, and you just...
464009 466596 you brace yourself,<br />and you ravage the midsection.
466763 468266 - Pinch the... Yeah. Okay.<br />- I get it. Okay, thank you.
468432 470310 - The picture's painted.<br />- You get the gist.
470477 472648 What exactly brings you here today?
472814 475527 Why am I... Wow. Okay.
475694 477572 I care.
477822 480285 I know I turn everything into a joke,<br />but I...
482372 485001 I care, and I, I wanna use that feeling...
486045 487923 for something important.
488339 489676 I, I wanna matter.
492596 494308 I need to show my girl that I matter.
495685 496687 And...
497396 499400 you know,<br />I feel like I'm wasting the good stuff here.
499567 501486 - Is the man not gonna be joining us?<br />- The man?
501653 503782 Yeah. I should save this if he's gonna...
504325 506203 As, as far as you're concerned right now,<br />I'm the man.
506369 507496 - No.<br />- The man is me.
507913 510876 I am the man in this circumstance.
511712 513673 He doesn't do this kind of thing anymore.
513840 514675 - Cameos?<br />- Meetings.
514842 516384 - Meetings.<br />- Entry-level meetings.
516553 517346 Entry-level?
517511 519349 Aren't you the chauffeur...
519514 521518 - maybe?<br />- I... Common misconception.
521686 524773 - Okay.<br />- I did begin my career as Mr. Stark's driver.
524941 525943 - Okay.<br />- Quickly pivoted to...
526110 527487 - Chauffeur.<br />- ...the Head of Security.
527654 529491 The Head of... Of course, yes, yes, yes.
529657 532537 And why I am vetting your résumé.
532704 534790 You seem to have left out<br />whether or not you had...
534958 536460 any experience as a member of a team.
536627 538839 Could you maybe<br />add a little bit of perspective there?
539006 541176 No, yes, of course. I was Special Forces...
541343 543847 - Okay.<br />- but I was... Mainly, I was team leader...
544015 545099 founder, really, of X-Force.
545267 547186 Sadly, they,<br />they all perished in action though.
547353 548647 How exactly did that happen?
548813 550691 Well, the police say gravity, but if...
550859 551693 Just between us...
551860 553446 - they didn't test well in the focus group.<br />- I see.
553613 555366 - Particularly Cable.<br />- X-Force.
555533 557411 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look,<br />I can see this isn't going well.
557578 558955 Please stop writing. Look, I, I...
559122 560958 I'm just... I wanna be an Avenger.
562711 564464 I wanna be an Avenger.
566384 567761 Why do you wanna be an Avenger?
568304 571267 Look around you. I mean, they're the,<br />they're the best of the best.
571434 573228 And, and what they do matters.
573396 575649 I need to be an Avenger.
575942 579531 Sir, my girl has kinda had it with my shtick,<br />and I, if I don't, you know...
579698 582327 turn things around<br />and do something with my gifts...
582494 584038 I don't think it's gonna<br />really work out for me...
584205 585457 and I wouldn't blame her.
586876 590882 Avengers are a very unique group<br />of superheroes...
591133 592259 that stand for something...
592427 595014 more than just fighting and wearing costumes.
595181 598103 I mean, people look up to us.<br />Kids look up to us.
598269 599480 - They...<br />- I'm sorry. "Us?"
599647 601399 I wasn't aware that you were an Avenger.
602193 603653 - Avengers-adjacent, technically.<br />- Oh, wow.
603820 606867 What's your superpower?<br />Is it parallel parking? I am so sorry.
607368 608620 That was cruel.
608787 610915 I lash out when I'm nervous.<br />Won't happen again.
611082 612376 - Let's cut to the chase.<br />- Please.
612543 613879 You just said moments ago...
614045 617969 that you wanted to be an Avenger<br />because you need it.
618469 619721 Yes, sir, I do.
619889 622726 But the Avengers don't do the job because<br />they need it.
622894 624813 They do the job because people need them.
626024 627442 Do you see the distinction?
629237 630697 Yes, sir.
631533 633074 Please, Mr. Hogan.
633241 636491 I don't wanna spend the rest of my life<br />like an annoying one-trick pony.
639366 640366 All right.
641408 642991 Oh, my God, you're standing.
643158 644491 Yeah, now's the time that we stand.
644658 645491 Damn it.
645658 647116 Now, the problem might be that you're...
647283 649533 reaching a little, little too high.
649699 652116 Aim for the middle, and you'll never miss.
652283 654449 Right? I think you got a good heart.<br />I believe what you're saying.
655366 658491 But not everybody's the world-saving type.<br />I'm not, and I'm happy.
659199 660908 Right? I found my place.
661741 662991 Find your place.
664199 665574 - All right? Get back out there.<br />- Mm-hmm.
666283 669158 - We'll keep an eye on you. Good luck.<br />- Okay.
672699 674616 Fetch the car. I wanna hit Shake Shack.
675074 676824 Rejection makes me hungy.
677658 679199 - Really? No?<br />- No, no. Please.
679366 681949 - Yeah, no, no, no. Okay, thank you.<br />- Oh, okay.
684158 687241 <i>You know what they say.<br />When one door closes...</i>
688574 689616 <i>your locker at work opens.</i>
699949 702991 Now let's go sell some certified<br />pre-owned vehicles, motherfu...
705449 708408 Technically, the,<br />the Carnival's not a minivan.
709658 710658 It's an MPV.
710824 712408 So how does the Kia compare to...
712574 713866 - the Honda Odyssey?<br />- The Odyssey?
714033 716574 That's a great question.<br />It doesn't fucking suck.
717241 719449 You know, you can answer<br />the question without swearing.
719616 721533 I'm sorry, Tammy, I don't, I don't have kids.
722241 723824 Not that I haven't dreamt of that...
723991 726033 but I don't have a lot of vaginal sex.
729533 730908 {\an8}You'll get 'em next time, pal.
731074 733533 And look,<br />you can always go back to superhero-ing.
733699 735574 I mean,<br />I know I'd like to see you back in the suit.
736283 738699 I don't keep it in my locker<br />so that I can wear it.
739116 741616 I keep it in my locker in case<br />we need to saddle up again.
741783 744658 Hey, hey, hey. What?<br />What is that doing in there?
744991 745824 I'm done.
747533 748533 I'm done.
749533 751533 And I'm fine with being done.
751699 753199 Look, is sales the best match?
753366 754199 Probably not.
754366 757741 Is this the life that<br />I always imagined for myself? Fuck no.
758699 761324 But this is the right fit for me,<br />Sugar Bear, it is.
761616 763033 Okay, Mr. Wilson.
763408 767158 I'm just saying, once a month,<br />we could go on a little mission.
767324 769824 We're human beings. We crave purpose.
769991 771658 After all, we're Deadpool.
771824 775783 Please stop saying that. We're not Deadpool.<br />I'm not even Deadpool anymore.
776741 779574 Well, if you're gonna have a midlife crisis,<br />go big.
779741 780741 A few years ago...
780908 783908 a friend of mine got his nipples pierced<br />with a titanium chain...
784074 787033 that goes down<br />and attaches to his Van Johnson.
791074 794199 Are, are you feeling grumplestiltskin<br />'cause it's your birthday?
796199 797033 What?
798033 798866 No.
800033 800866 No.
804491 806241 Surprise!
806533 808908 Hey, you guys are lucky I'm not armed.
809574 810741 Get in here.
810908 813158 If this were six years ago,<br />you'd all be dead.
813324 816116 So then, he gets out of the cab,<br />and you will not believe it.
816283 818616 - I turn around, and what do I find?<br />- AirPods.
818783 820074 - His AirPods. Come on.<br />- His AirPods!
820241 821158 Crazy story.
821324 823699 - Every time. Come on.<br />- Every single time.
825783 827199 Make any sales today?
827366 828741 You know I didn't.
828908 832033 Did you sell any dreamcatchers on Etsy<br />or whatever it is that you do?
832199 833658 Our rent's due in three days, Wade.
833824 835074 I can't keep carrying you.
835241 836866 Relax. I have the money.
837033 840449 I sold some old blood pressure medication<br />I found lying around.
840824 842199 You tryin' to kill me, motherfucker?
842366 844491 I'm not the one dousing everything in salt, motherfucker.
844658 846699 I pray every day that...
846866 848533 fire finds your body...
848699 850074 and finishes the job...
850241 852699 - God didn't have the nuts to do.<br />- That's hurtful.
852866 855699 If you could hear the look on my face,<br />you'd smell how sad I am.
855866 856991 You watched anything good?
857158 858741 <i>Great British Bake Off.</i>
858908 860199 Oh, goddamn.
860366 862699 That show stood between me and suicide<br />for ten years.
862866 865241 Those are my feelings<br />on abortion, religious freedom...
865408 867491 animal rights, privacy rights, vaccines...
867658 869866 free-market capitalism,<br />global climate change.
870033 872158 Yeah, duh-duh-duh.<br />No, no speaking lines, Buck.
872741 873699 Hi, Yukio.
873866 874783 Hi, Wade.
874949 876658 Nice fake o'clock shadow.
877616 880907 It's a summer balayage. From the French.
881073 884240 It's meant to mimic the<br />natural highlights of the sun.
884407 886115 - It's a toupée.<br />- It's a hair system.
886282 889531 - I love your hair system, Wade.<br />- Thank you.
889947 891531 Wanna do some cocaine?
891697 894656 Hey, cocaine is the one thing<br />that Feige said is off limits.
894822 897488 - What about Bolivian marching powder?<br />- They know all the slang terms.
897655 898613 They have a list.
898780 900446 - Even snowboarding?<br />- Even disco dust.
900613 902198 - White girl interrupted?<br />- Even Forrest Bump.
902365 904242 - Booger sugar?<br />- I wouldn't even try powdered gonuts.
904409 907871 - You wanna build a snowman?<br />- Yes. But I can't.
909414 910248 Pull here.
910916 911917 - Here?<br />- Yeah.
913294 914795 - What happened?<br />- That's the fun part.
916213 917339 Thanks for coming.
917506 918424 Yeah.
918590 919591 How's work?
919884 921093 Oh, I got a promotion.
922094 922970 No way.
923137 926349 Yeah. It's mind-numbing middle management,<br />but I'm happy.
926516 927559 That's great.
929519 930854 - You seeing anyone?<br />- How about you?
932522 933356 Yeah.
933857 936402 A guy from work. Dermot.
936569 937611 Dermot.
937778 939113 - He's kind.<br />- Good.
939280 940781 Likes to go hiking.
940949 942325 Hasn't gotten me shot yet.
942491 944619 Well, it's early days.
948748 950500 What about you? You seeing anyone?
951543 954880 No, no, I live in a one-bedroom apartment.<br />I share a bed with Blind Al.
956549 959802 - Okay. All right.<br />- All right.
961471 964724 <i>Happy birthday to you</i>
964891 966434 - Speech! Speech!<br />- Yes!
966601 968394 All right. Okay, okay, okay.
969354 970356 Birthdays.
970522 973192 Boy, every spin around the moon<br />is a new adventure indeed.
973359 975402 - Sun, dumbass.<br />- Okay, round-earther.
977071 978990 - Where was I?<br />- The adventure of life.
979156 980157 Right.
980324 981784 It's been a challenging few years.
981951 983828 Haven't seen you guys in a while.
983995 986081 Been through a lot, change of life.
986248 988166 - Menopause?<br />- Bitch, are you improv-ing?
988333 989918 - Mm-mm.<br />- Sorry.
990878 992254 I'm sorry that you had to see that, Yukio.
992421 993506 It's okay.
995799 996842 But I'm happy.
997260 998511 You know, and that's, that's...
998677 1001472 because of each and every one of you.
1001848 1003307 I guess, what I'm trying to say is...
1003475 1004851 how proud I am, how grateful I am...
1005018 1006270 to be standing in a room...
1006436 1009106 with every single person I love.
1014695 1016322 I'm the luckiest man alive.
1018824 1019909 Make a wish, buddy.
1020076 1021411 Ten-four, good buddy.
1022620 1023747 Going down.
1030129 1031004 Wade Wilson?
1031171 1034091 Oh, yeah. Dancers.<br />Dopinder must have ordered you.
1034591 1035926 Are those supposed to be cop costumes?
1036301 1037261 Never mind.
1037928 1041266 Take your clothes off but leave the helmets.<br />And this isn't <i>Pretty Woman.</i>
1042225 1043518 We're kissing. All right?
1043684 1045311 What song do you guys normally dance to?
1046687 1049525 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
1049817 1051026 Is that supposed to be scary?
1051193 1054822 Pegging isn't new for me, friendo.<br />But it is for Disney.
1055239 1056074 Ah, ta, ta, ta!
1056365 1060203 Okay, I've never been a natural bottom,<br />so we're gonna take things real slow.
1060369 1062246 And I want some crazy eye contact.
1062414 1063457 Not you.<br />You.
1063915 1065709 Can't see your eyes through the mask,<br />but I can feel them.
1065875 1067461 We're gonna move on down the hallway...
1067627 1070798 so we can spare a cleanup on aisle asshole.<br />How does everyone feel about this plan?
1070965 1073926 - I don't like you.<br />- Yes. Let's hold on to that attitude.
1074093 1075803 And we're gonna do it angry.
1093948 1095116 Mr. Wilson...
1097034 1099912 you appear to have soiled yourself<br />while unconscious.
1100079 1102332 I wasn't unconscious. Who are you?
1102665 1104459 I go by the name of Paradox.
1104626 1108046 Mr. Paradox.<br />And you're sitting here at the TVA.
1108213 1110216 The Time Variance Authority.
1110383 1112635 We're really a watchdog organization...
1112801 1116514 except we're more lighthearted<br />than that sounds with a sort of...
1116681 1118767 throwback, ironic twist.
1118933 1123147 And we're in charge of defending<br />what's known as the Sacred Timeline.
1123313 1126483 Holy fuck. That is a shit-ton of exposition<br />for a threequel.
1126650 1128527 Is this because I used Cable's time machine?
1128694 1131321 Brought a couple of people back to life,<br />then I destroyed it.
1131489 1132865 - That was a long time ago.<br />- Yes...
1133032 1135701 we're aware of your abuse of your timeline.
1135868 1137996 And you were so abusive of it.
1138789 1140666 No, it has nothing to do with that.
1140832 1141917 Walk with me.
1147798 1152011 I brought you here, Mr. Wilson,<br />to tell you that you're special.
1152762 1155640 In fact,<br />you've been chosen for a higher purpose...
1155807 1157517 a purpose unclear even to me.
1157934 1159978 But one that could...
1160145 1163065 save the entire Sacred Timeline...
1163231 1165818 from a possibly grisly fate<br />sometime in the future...
1165984 1170281 which may very well need to be... avenged.
1170573 1171950 This Sacred Timeline...
1173034 1174953 I assume I'm going to marvel...
1175453 1176496 at how...
1177163 1178915 cinematic it feels?
1179082 1181084 Gratuitous cameos...
1181251 1183087 indiscriminate use of Variants,<br />the whole package?
1183253 1185380 Well, you tell me.
1192180 1193013 Cap!
1200271 1202774 You are no longer lost, Wade.
1202941 1205402 You can be a hero among heroes.
1205945 1208114 We've been surveilling you for quite a while.
1208280 1211033 - Subway station.<br />- A TVA outpost, yes.
1212243 1213370 - And what is that?<br />- Hmm?
1216414 1217790 Is that me? Is that Thor?
1219292 1220502 Is he crying?
1220668 1222461 Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
1222628 1223962 That happens in the distant future.
1224129 1226338 - Why is Thor crying? Quick! Tell me.<br />- Do not speak to her.
1226505 1227339 Stop that. Eyes on me.
1227506 1229715 I brought you here<br />to offer you an opportunity.
1229882 1233134 The opportunity you sought years ago,<br />but for which you were not ready.
1233300 1234926 We believe you're ready now.
1235093 1236969 Ready for a chance to leave your timeline...
1237136 1239471 and join the greatest universe of all.
1239638 1241180 I am about to give you the thing<br />you've always wanted.
1241347 1242890 Oh, I smell what you're steppin' in.
1243056 1245474 The power in the Marvel Universe<br />is about to change forever.
1247850 1249518 I am the Messiah...
1251310 1253479 I am...
1255062 1256313 Marvel Jesus.
1257731 1260441 Can you excuse me for just a moment?<br />I'm just gonna go over here.
1263860 1265235 Suck it, Fox!
1265402 1266694 I'm going to Disneyland.
1267236 1268112 Get fucked!
1271864 1273823 - Where do I sign?<br />- Oh, there's no need for paperwork.
1273990 1276200 Good. Not to brag, but I do not read.
1276367 1279285 - Oh.<br />- There is one thing I will need, though.
1283788 1285872 Oh, fuck off!
1286039 1287998 Adorn me, Beardo.
1308635 1309594 Fuckin' A!
1310636 1312470 It's perfect! FYI...
1312637 1315472 your tailor is a predator,<br />but I love it. Snug.
1315639 1320017 No camel toe.<br />New car smell and adamantium katanas?
1320392 1321851 You shouldn't have.
1322185 1324311 Go ahead. Take it in.
1324477 1326979 And yes, your underwear is getting tighter.
1327146 1328772 That guy knows what I'm talking about.
1328939 1330440 His clothes says middle management...
1330606 1333066 but his eyes say fuck-y fuck-y.
1333232 1334900 Yes. You look very nice.
1335067 1338110 "Nice?" Your buddy here is ready to<br />throw it all away for me.
1338277 1339486 - You callin' your wife?<br />- HR.
1339653 1340821 Does your wife work in HR?
1340987 1343072 I'm really glad you're taking this so well.
1343405 1345198 Oh. I'm taking it well.
1345364 1348325 I have never had a problem<br />traveling for work. That said...
1348491 1349659 we should talk vacation days.
1350034 1352452 I'm more of a<br />one-week-on-one-week-off kind of guy.
1352618 1353953 I think it's what they do in Denmark.
1354119 1356580 You know, you'll never see a<br />Danish flag on the moon, but...
1356746 1357830 goddamn it, they're happy.
1357996 1360498 Now, let's power up your little<br />Amazon Fire phone there...
1360665 1363875 and zip me back home so I can let my friends<br />know that they've been upgraded...
1364042 1365084 to disciples.
1365251 1368252 Yeah. I don't think you... quite understand.
1369087 1373297 You will not be returning to your home<br />because there will be no home to return to.
1373464 1374298 Come again?
1374465 1375506 This time in my ears.
1379884 1382803 This is your universe, Mr. Wilson.
1383428 1384679 That...
1384846 1388931 is what happens when a universe<br />loses their Anchor Being.
1389098 1391182 See how it decays from the inside?
1391349 1394017 - This is how a reality dies.<br />- What's an Anchor Being?
1394184 1397519 An Anchor Being is an entity of<br />such vital importance that when they die...
1397686 1401188 their whole world<br />slowly withers out of existence.
1401355 1403982 You've just won the lottery<br />because I didn't die.
1404148 1405858 It was just a little midlife crisis.<br />I'm better now.
1406024 1407442 Oh, no, no, no.
1412152 1414863 - Oh, my God.<br />- Oh, I love to laugh.
1415029 1417740 Can you imagine if you were the Anchor Being?
1419699 1422200 - Yeah.<br />- No, it isn't you, Mr. Wilson.
1423034 1427328 Your Anchor Being died<br />in an act of self-sacrifice so epic...
1427745 1429871 that it sent shivers down the Timeline.
1430247 1433081 I am referring, of course, to...
1434499 1438209 Logan. The Wolverine.
1441753 1444088 <i>Don't be what they made you.</i>
1454469 1456637 <i>So this is what it feels like...</i>
1458471 1459471 Logan.
1460389 1461390 Of course.
1462140 1462973 Logan.
1465892 1467184 Logan?
1467351 1469310 The guy with forks for hands?
1469477 1470728 That Wolverine?
1472104 1476148 Yeah, I got it. You can turn your retro<br />graphics of death off now. Make it stop.
1476314 1478774 We're not doing it, Mr. Wilson.<br />We certainly can't stop it.
1481192 1482151 How long have we got?
1482317 1484653 In most cases, couple thousand years.
1484819 1486820 - Well, sweet.<br />- Well, most cases aren't fast enough.
1486987 1487946 Not for me.
1488530 1489531 What does that mean?
1489697 1491782 It means that I have been tasked...
1491948 1494199 with overseeing the end of your universe.
1494366 1496993 And regardless of what the<br />pencil pushers upstairs would prefer...
1497160 1498286 I will not...
1498744 1502038 waste my life watching it die slowly<br />of natural causes.
1502204 1504372 We used to just prune these things. Simple.
1504539 1506248 Elegant. Efficient. But I'm told the TVA...
1506415 1508667 doesn't like to do that anymore.<br />Well I do.
1508833 1511168 And no matter what my so-called<br />superiors say, the multiverse...
1511334 1513002 does not need a babysitter.
1513169 1514961 We need a mercy killer.
1515128 1516546 And in this instance...
1516712 1519131 I am the mercy killer.
1524216 1526135 What in the MacGuffin is that?
1526302 1528469 That's a Time Ripper, Mr. Wilson.
1528636 1530179 An accelerant.
1530345 1534933 Once completed, it will allow me to destroy<br />the spacetime matrix of your universe.
1535099 1537101 You see, I don't want to work for the TVA.
1537268 1539353 I want to be the TVA.
1539520 1542064 And the first step involves<br />showing this organization...
1542230 1543898 how much more efficient it can become.
1544065 1548360 To wit, I will be giving your universe<br />a swift and compassionate end.
1548527 1549945 And don't worry,<br />your friends won't feel a thing.
1550111 1551905 It'll be over just like this.<br />"Oh, what's that?"
1553281 1554365 Trust me.
1567084 1569252 You're gonna Old Yeller my fucking universe?
1569419 1571629 Mm... In your parlance, yes.
1571796 1572838 Two in the heart, one in the head.
1573255 1575215 Look, Mr. Wilson, you have two choices.
1575382 1578593 You can either rejoin your loved ones<br />and collectively cease to exist in...
1578759 1581596 I'd say, seventy-two hours. Or...
1581762 1584306 you join the Sacred Timeline.
1584473 1586725 And you end your days of<br />insignificance...
1586891 1588809 and mediocrity.
1588976 1589893 Wade.
1590603 1592312 Wade, you can finally...
1592479 1594897 finally, matter.
1604655 1606699 That's all I've ever really wanted.
1606866 1608117 I know.
1608742 1609743 I know.
1610702 1614205 And you know I'm,<br />I'm nothing if not morally flexible.
1616707 1617665 Yep, yep.
1620001 1621002 I'll do it.
1621168 1623587 Wise choice.<br />The Sacred Timeline's happy to have you.
1623754 1625589 I was actually talking about<br />finding the Wolverine...
1625756 1626840 and breaking your fucking nose.
1640684 1643020 Find him. Find him!
1643186 1644937 <i>And boy, did he ever.</i>
1646814 1648232 <i>Which brings us back to this.</i>
1650401 1652360 <i>The desecration of the sacred corpse.</i>
1656697 1657907 Oh, my God!
1659324 1661951 Oh! My own fucking arm!
1666079 1667164 Now we're talkin'!
1667289 1668581 Not like this!
1668748 1670708 No, dear God! No!
1670875 1673044 I'm sorry! Wolverine-ing is hard!
1673210 1674211 Make it stop!
1674378 1676129 Mangold tried.
1678381 1680341 You sick fuck!
1680508 1681676 Logan was a hero.
1681967 1684761 And the only thing worth a shit<br />to ever come out of Canada.
1692726 1697021 Get my country's name<br />out of your fuckin' mouth.
1698147 1699731 And my sword. Give me that.
1703193 1705486 Oh, I gotta find me another Logan.
1705945 1707237 An alive one.
1707488 1709656 Don't get up, guys. I'll see myself out.
1717245 1718080 Logan!
1721833 1723459 I'm gonna need you to come with me.
1724751 1725752 Who's asking?
1727921 1729965 Oh, look at this little Hairy Lou Retton.
1730131 1731716 Did you stick the landing, little guy?
1732383 1733217 Yes, you did!
1733383 1735302 Comic accurate short king.
1735469 1737554 Such a cute wittle Wolvie.
1737721 1739430 Cue the fuckin' montage, baby.
1740056 1743100 Ahoy! Everything seems to be on fire.
1743266 1744351 You have a dragon?
1745102 1748020 You have Anchor Being written all over...
1757362 1758362 Patch!
1760405 1761656 Now we're talkin'.
1762282 1763575 Oh, yeah.
1764200 1766119 That's the whole goddamn package right there.
1767119 1768203 Howdy!
1768370 1770872 I'm just... I'm auditioning Anchor Beings.
1771039 1773583 Oh. Yeah, that's gonna need some coconut oil.
1777961 1779796 What in the fuck?
1780213 1781714 Are you okay?
1782215 1783257 Oh, yes, yes.
1783424 1785259 Classic John Byrne brown and tan.
1785425 1787386 Now, you fought the Hulk in this outfit. No?
1790263 1791972 I'm Marvel Jesus, you dull creature,<br />and I will not...
1802856 1805400 It's not you. We're just going<br />in a different direction.
1808694 1810821 You know, from behind,<br />you look a little bit like Henry...
1810988 1812197 Oh, my fuck!
1812531 1815241 The Cavillrine. The legends are true.
1815909 1818661 And may I say, sir,<br />on behalf of all humanity...
1818827 1820537 this just feels right.
1820703 1823790 We will treat you so much better<br />than those shit fucks down the street.
1823956 1824999 You were just leavin'.
1825166 1827334 No, sir.<br />Not while the fate of my universe is at...
1832213 1833631 This one looks promising.
1833798 1834632 Down you go.
1836425 1837259 Again.
1838385 1840344 I told you. You're not welcome here.
1840511 1841929 You're not welcome anywhere.
1842096 1843306 Now get the fuck out of my bar.
1843472 1845933 Just give me one more drink<br />and then I'll leave.
1846099 1847725 That's not how it works.
1847892 1850144 It does now. Leave the bottle.
1850311 1851145 I know you, bub?
1851312 1853397 Nope. But I know you.
1853814 1855190 Everybody knows me.
1856774 1857942 I'm the Wolverine.
1858108 1859902 Yes, you are.
1860069 1862362 And I'm gonna need you<br />to come with me right now.
1863780 1865156 Look, lady, I'm not interested.
1865323 1868033 - Really gettin' into your cups here.<br />- Why would I go with you?
1869242 1871078 Because, unfortunately...
1871244 1872162 I need you...
1872329 1876416 and even more unfortunately,<br />my entire world needs you.
1877250 1878711 You two gonna fuck or fight?
1882673 1883882 You gonna take that from him?
1884257 1885092 Yep.
1885968 1887010 I can tell you have a sort of...
1887177 1889638 don't-get-too-close-I'll-only-<br />break-your-heart vibe going here...
1889805 1892057 but every other Wolverine<br />would've really hurt me by now.
1892225 1895103 And, I'm sort of on the tick-tick.<br />So upsy-daisy. Here we go.
1895269 1897480 - Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey!<br />- Up you go. I got you, big guy.
1900899 1902026 Whiskey dick of the claws.
1902193 1904653 - It's quite common in Wolverines over forty.<br />- You don't want this.
1904821 1907365 You're right. I don't.<br />And you don't want this.
1907531 1910159 Unless you wanna take a deep breath<br />through your fuckin' forehead...
1910326 1912203 I suggest you reconsider.
1912370 1913454 Let's go, peanut.
1918001 1919836 Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
1920545 1921380 Watch this.
1922506 1924549 All right. That... Whoa.
1925216 1926050 Easy.
1929846 1930680 Good God.
1931431 1933183 Thirsty little honey badger, aren't ya?
1934351 1935894 It's okay. Keep goin'.
1936061 1937897 Audiences are accustomed to long run times.
1943944 1945404 Guess you'll have to do.
1945863 1946864 Okay, here we...
1948073 1950409 Oh! Look at those jammies.
1950826 1954079 That only took twenty fucking years.
1954497 1956457 One Anchor Being coming right up!
1956624 1958709 On your left, baby girl.
1959001 1962338 This Logan has the same<br />he-can-do-anything-even-musicals look.
1962505 1963506 And bonus...
1963673 1964965 he's actually wearing a costume...
1965133 1966842 like he's not embarrassed to be in<br />a superhero movie for once.
1967009 1968344 I don't understand.
1968511 1969929 You said my universe is dying...
1970096 1972515 because this sack of nuts<br />got himself killed.
1972682 1975226 - Well, problem solved.<br />- My God.
1975393 1979397 You actually think<br />you can replace an Anchor Being...
1979564 1980982 with this?
1981817 1984861 I wouldn't have accepted any other Wolverine<br />BT dubs. But you...
1985028 1988448 have outdone yourself<br />and brought me the worst Wolverine!
1988615 1989575 What do you mean, the worst one?
1989741 1990701 Mr. Wilson.
1991367 1994496 This Wolverine let down his entire world.
1995372 1997249 He's the stuff of legend,<br />but not in a good way.
1997624 1998917 And what he did...
1999084 2000294 well...
2000461 2002588 some things are just beyond forgiveness.
2005174 2006008 Okay.
2006175 2008844 How do I... How do I make this right?<br />I'll do anything.
2009345 2012306 I gave you a chance at greatness.
2012473 2014767 Because my superiors deemed you special.
2014934 2016435 Clearly not special in a good way.
2016602 2019438 Apparently you have some<br />important future purpose to serve.
2019605 2020732 With Thor. He holds me.
2020898 2024861 But, I did my duty.<br />I gave you the opportunity to be somebody.
2025027 2028239 And instead of accepting my offering<br />with humility and gratitude...
2028406 2029240 you broke my nose.
2029616 2032159 - It looks great.<br />- And you decimated dozens of my men...
2032327 2033953 with the exhumed corpse of a hero.
2034120 2036164 Dishonoring not only his remains<br />but his memory.
2036331 2037374 What are you, the Internet?
2037540 2039709 Your world is dying!
2039876 2040877 Thank you very much.
2041378 2042504 And there's no stopping it.
2044797 2046299 The humane thing to do...
2046466 2047342 is to make it quick.
2047509 2050220 Is the thought of vaporizing my universe<br />making you peckish?
2050387 2051429 I'm eating my feelings.
2051596 2054642 I'm about to lose everything that I've<br />ever cared about because that hairy...
2054808 2056559 thundercunt from down undercunt...
2056727 2059772 finally dies<br />and he's standing right behind me, isn't he?
2060481 2061774 Welcome to the MCU, by the way.
2062399 2063817 You're joining at a bit of a low point.
2064652 2066570 As for you, I wanna talk to your boss.
2066737 2069907 I want you to get him on the phone<br />and you tell him, her, or them...
2070073 2072201 that Marvel H. Christ isn't playing.
2077581 2078541 Holy shit.
2079417 2083212 I just heard a symphony<br />of buttholes clenching all at once.
2083379 2084255 You're off grid.
2084422 2086758 Your bosses don't know what you sick fucks<br />are doing down here.
2086925 2089969 Well, I'll tell you what.<br />I have a black belt in Karen...
2090136 2091429 And I'm gonna go upstairs...
2091595 2093557 and I'm gonna tell 'em all about<br />you and your...
2094683 2096309 Silence is nice, isn't it?
2096476 2097477 Where the fuck did he go?
2097644 2099353 To the trash heap. You'll fit right in.
2102607 2103442 That was close.
2124964 2126841 Don't just stand there, you ape.
2127466 2128508 Give me a hand up.
2130302 2132179 Nope. I'm actually okay.<br />Thank you very much...
2134724 2135558 Where the hell are we?
2135725 2138268 I don't know. Looks kind of Mad Max-y.
2138436 2140313 But that would be IP infringement, right?
2140480 2141647 Fucking jokes.
2145025 2146402 Fuck! Fuck.
2146569 2147903 Were you even listening back there?
2148071 2150740 If we don't make it back to that<br />Mr. Paradox asshole...
2151074 2152242 everyone I know is gonna die.
2152408 2154077 Not my fuckin' problem.
2154244 2155453 Oh, is that all you got?
2156496 2158498 Is that what you said<br />when your world went to shit?
2160959 2161793 Come again?
2161960 2163336 Yeah, I heard all about you.
2163879 2165922 How you screwed up everything.
2166089 2168759 You should be thankin' me<br />for pulling you out of that bed you shit in.
2169468 2171177 You back-stabbing son of a bitch!
2177226 2178644 Are you ready to be calm now?
2185776 2188279 Rest in pieces, Fox.
2203044 2204546 I don't want to fight you, peanut.
2205755 2207214 Doesn't matter what you did.
2207507 2208550 I just need your help.
2210427 2212011 I don't fuckin' care.
2214431 2215265 Uh-oh.
2220770 2223148 Fuck. This is gonna hurt.
2227319 2228653 All right.
2228987 2229822 Fuck it.
2230739 2232615 Let's give the people what they came for.
2233408 2235160 Let's fuckin' go.
2236328 2238330 Get your special sock out, nerds.
2238496 2240332 It's gonna get good.
2293387 2294388 Gotcha!
2300978 2301812 Baby Knife!
2306734 2308527 Let's see you grow your fuckin' head back.
2308694 2310738 Wait, wait, wait! I can fix it! I can fix it.
2310905 2312698 - Fix what?<br />- Whatever it is that you did.
2313616 2314992 Whatever made you so bad.
2315493 2319289 Those, those pricks in the TVA.<br />You heard him.
2320540 2321791 They have the power to end my universe...
2321957 2325044 but they also have the power to change yours.
2326754 2327838 We get back there...
2328005 2331051 and we can fix your world. Together.
2332385 2333469 I promise.
2334971 2336222 They can fix it.
2337348 2338599 Hey!
2338767 2340769 We fight each other, we lose.
2340936 2342187 Dear God, it's him.
2342353 2344355 - Who?<br />- The one.
2344690 2347067 The superhero equivalent<br />to comfort food, or Molly.
2347651 2350987 White guys' answer to all the<br />disappointments. And another A-lister.
2351655 2353031 Fair warning, gorgeous.
2353198 2355158 You're going to encounter<br />some indelicate language...
2355326 2357661 a smidge of ass play,<br />but we've been prohibited...
2357828 2359205 from using cocaine. On camera.
2359371 2360206 They're coming.
2360456 2361957 Who's "they?"
2368547 2369966 Oh, they're driving angry.
2375805 2377849 Now that's a superhero landing.
2384814 2386065 I got this.
2409757 2410590 Stay close.
2411216 2412092 Aye, aye, Cap'n.
2413677 2414637 You got this.
2416972 2420392 Cassandra is gonna be giddy<br />when she sees what we caught.
2421435 2422436 You can't run.
2422603 2423812 Everybody knows that.
2423979 2426106 You see anyone runnin', dick for brains?
2427232 2428901 You're not gonna love what happens next.
2429067 2430528 Oh. Oh, my God.
2430986 2431820 Oh, my God.
2431987 2434198 - Oh, my God, he's gonna say it.<br />- Ah! Fuck.
2434365 2436492 - Oh, my God! He's gonna say it!<br />- Say what?
2436659 2437660 Avengers, assemble...
2437826 2439078 - Flame on!<br />- I'm sorry, what now?
2462226 2463061 Fuck!
2467899 2468983 We don't know that guy.
2469151 2470026 We thought we did.
2470277 2471695 I know you.
2472446 2473280 Holy...
2475824 2476866 Sabretooth.
2477576 2478410 Your brother.
2479328 2481288 Ready to die?
2481455 2483708 Wait, wait, wait!<br />Time!
2484416 2485960 You look ridiculous.
2486210 2488713 People have waited decades for this fight.
2488879 2490548 It's not gonna be easy.<br />Baby Knife.
2490715 2492467 Shoot the double, you take him down.
2492633 2494635 Side control, then full mount...
2494802 2497763 and you ground and pound<br />till he makes no sound because he's dead.
2497930 2498764 Shut the fuck up!
2498931 2499890 Oh, my God!
2500057 2501684 Okay. Good luck. I'm a huge fan.
2514739 2515824 What is it, girl?
2515991 2517117 Is there trouble at the well?
2523331 2524249 Big trouble.
2524415 2526001 Behold!
2526167 2529045 The head of your precious queen...
2529212 2530213 Furiosa!
2531382 2533049 I have the Wolverine!
2533216 2536303 I alone control her!
2536470 2538389 You come for me...
2538889 2541267 you come for her.
2543018 2546647 So sorry. I know it's pronounced "him."<br />I'm gender blind. It's my cross to bear.
2546813 2547773 Who's next?
2548149 2549191 Toad!
2549358 2550234 You're up.
2557992 2560036 - Uh-oh. Oh, holy...<br />- Fuck.
2570963 2572924 God of Thunder.
2576844 2578138 How long was I asleep?
2578305 2580098 Not all of you was asleep.
2580265 2581641 Don't bother.
2581808 2583601 They're very thorough.
2584061 2586104 If you know where we are, start talking.
2586855 2587856 You're in The Void.
2588481 2589775 Think of it as purgatory.
2590650 2593070 Reed called it a metaphysical junkyard.
2593236 2596364 Where anything useless goes<br />before it gets annihilated forever.
2596907 2600911 And where the TVA sends people that don't<br />play nice with the rest of the multiverse.
2601078 2602496 - Like you?<br />- And you.
2602663 2604039 What does the annihilating?
2604623 2605458 Alioth.
2605624 2609295 Alioth is in this thing?<br />From <i>Loki,</i> season one, episode five?
2609462 2611380 Everyone here is on the run from Alioth.
2612047 2613507 Most don't make it.
2613674 2614967 There's a resistance, though.
2615759 2618512 Other people like us that managed to survive.
2618846 2622683 They're hidin' out in the borderlands,<br />trying to find a way the fuck outta here.
2622851 2624185 Then that's where we go.
2624352 2626062 "We?" Us? A team?
2626229 2628022 The answer is yes.<br />Shake on it.
2628773 2630024 Fuck! You nicked it.
2630191 2632026 Just got the tip with<br />your little steak knife.
2632193 2634153 These "others" can help us<br />get back to the TVA.
2634320 2635238 Make 'em fix things.
2637532 2638533 Something funny, bub?
2639158 2640869 She might have somethin' to say about that.
2641035 2641995 Who's "she?"
2643288 2644373 In The Void...
2644623 2646291 you're either food for Alioth...
2647083 2649128 or you work for her.
2721535 2723495 Huh. Paul Rudd finally aged.
2724621 2725998 You must be this year's Juggernaut.
2726373 2727917 - Thank you.<br />- I'd keep your voices down.
2728084 2729210 She don't like the chatter.
2729376 2730627 She's gonna love you.
2746769 2748187 Is it... Is that Charles?
2748480 2750648 Hey... Hey, Chuck! It's us!
2750815 2751983 That's not Chuck.
2752149 2753276 Ah, shit.
2754736 2756196 Oh, ableism. Great.
2756363 2758781 That's not gonna go over well<br />with the woke mob.
2758948 2760408 A Wolverine.
2760908 2763203 I wondered when I'd get one of you.
2763954 2765122 You're one of Xavier's.
2765288 2766748 You-You know him? You know Chuck?
2766915 2768000 Oh, I knew him.
2768291 2769793 We shared a womb.
2770002 2773505 Tried to strangle the sly little fellow<br />with my umbilical cord.
2773672 2776675 Amen. I've never loved roommates.<br />Mine's blind.
2777009 2778385 Except she can see cocaine.
2778636 2780137 For some... reason.
2780303 2783015 You want to chime in, Your Majesty?<br />I'm dying here.
2783181 2784307 Who are you?
2784475 2787185 Charles Xavier's twin, Cassandra Nova.
2787520 2788896 - Bullshit!<br />- I was an anal birth.
2789772 2790981 You two are cute.
2791899 2793234 I have a good feeling about this.
2796279 2797405 And I've been trying to catch...
2797571 2799282 this little firefly for years.
2800074 2801659 Haven't I, Johnny?
2801826 2805038 Aw... You picked the wrong time<br />to make new friends.
2805204 2807540 Oh, Johnny told us all about you.
2807707 2809000 - Maybe shut up now.<br />- Yeah, maybe don't...
2809167 2810251 We're just talkin' here.
2810418 2813588 Yeah, Johnny told us<br />you're a psychotic megalomaniacal asshole.
2813755 2814506 His words, not mine.
2814673 2817050 Hellbent on domination and pain.
2818259 2820219 - You said all that about me?<br />- No!
2820387 2823723 - No! I don't... I didn't say any of that!<br />- Sticks and stones, Johnny!
2825350 2827352 Don't let her intimidate you.
2827519 2829104 It's like you said in the convoy.
2829271 2832107 This finger-lickin' dead-inside<br />pixie slab of...
2832274 2833984 third rate dime-store nut-milk...
2834151 2835945 can eat your delicious cinnamon ring...
2836111 2838113 - and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.<br />- Okay.
2838280 2840115 I have never said any of those words...
2840282 2842326 - in my entire life!<br />- Ha! The modesty.
2842492 2845370 People think I'm a shit talker.<br />But this guy...
2845746 2846581 Next level.
2846747 2848666 What? This... I... We...
2848833 2850250 I don't even know what half of that means!
2850417 2852920 - This... I... What? This...<br />- My hat's off to you, sir. Truly.
2853087 2854296 I didn't... He's... That's...
2855089 2856173 I don't...
2861721 2862638 Not my favorite Chris.
2862805 2865308 You stupid piece of shit.<br />You just got him fucking killed!
2865475 2867227 Hey! We're all grieving!
2867393 2869437 PS, do you know what<br />he was doing to the budget?
2872148 2873984 Alioth is hungry.
2874901 2876486 There's been some kind of mistake.
2876652 2878363 Big yellow is a back up Anchor Being...
2878529 2880949 and I'm Marvel Jesus. MJ, if you're nasty.
2881116 2882158 This may be hard to hear...
2882325 2884995 but there's another British villain<br />who's gonna destroy my universe...
2885161 2886162 and I'm gonna stop him.
2886329 2889207 Oh, honey, you don't really strike me as<br />the world-saving type.
2891752 2892711 Did I hit a nerve?
2893795 2895088 I didn't want it to come to this.
2895964 2896882 Either you help us...
2897048 2900010 or my friend here is gonna sing<br />the entire second act of <i>Music Man...</i>
2900177 2901345 with zero warm-up.
2902221 2903430 Where'd you get the chair?
2903597 2906100 Well, once in a while,<br />I do get a Charles through here.
2906517 2907894 Never mine, though.
2908060 2911230 No. He didn't care to find me.
2912398 2914901 Gen Z and their trauma-bragging!
2915067 2917612 Can't you just stuff it down,<br />turn it into accomplishment...
2917779 2919405 or cancer like the rest of us?
2919572 2921240 But I'm not like the rest of you.
2921407 2923159 Except maybe the Wolverine.
2923325 2925787 Now, we could be truly terrifying together.
2925953 2927204 You're that scary, huh?
2927372 2929206 The TVA certainly thought so.
2929791 2931918 They sent me here before I could walk.
2932377 2935046 And you know, it's the best thing<br />that ever happened to me.
2935505 2936423 I love it here.
2936589 2938050 You live in a garbage dump.
2938216 2940969 I think we both know who lives<br />in the garbage dump.
2941344 2942804 The Void is a paradise.
2943138 2946975 I can wield my power here without shame.
2947350 2950645 Unfortunately I had no Charles Xavier<br />to teach me temperance.
2951354 2953190 What about your Charles?
2953356 2954482 Did he protect you?
2955275 2957360 Did he make you feel safe?
2957528 2959447 We're mutants. We're never safe.
2967663 2969748 Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br />I don't... I don't want the smoke.
2970416 2973043 I don't have any beef with you.<br />I just want to save my friends.
2973211 2974545 I just... I want to go home.
2974712 2976380 Well, the thing is, I could get you home.
2976547 2978132 - Good.<br />- But I don't want to.
2978299 2979592 Not good.
2982761 2985056 What do you want, Wade Wilson?
2985556 2988935 Your... fingers are inside me,<br />but not in a good way.
2989102 2992063 My brother could<br />enter one's mind with a thought.
2992230 2994566 I have to get my hands dirty.
2997444 2998778 I've got you.
3001197 3002324 <i>I've got you...</i>
3004951 3005869 <i>What do you mean?</i>
3008037 3010457 I can't, I can't reach you. You're not here.
3010624 3012042 I'm right here.
3012501 3015337 - No, you're not. I can't...<br />- I'm right here.
3015504 3017506 Then show me. You got to do something.
3018924 3019800 Show you what?
3020384 3023137 Show me you care about<br />something bigger than you.
3024263 3028058 <i>Ever since they turned you down,<br />you took a knee.</i>
3028893 3030853 Baby, you never got back up.
3033063 3036651 I know you're going through something.<br />Let me go through it with you.
3038068 3040070 - Your crazy matches my crazy.<br />- Your crazy matches my crazy.
3043699 3044700 Where'd you go?
3045326 3046661 Oh, my God.
3049664 3051332 <i>You just say it. Okay?</i>
3052375 3053209 <i>Say, "I don't want you.</i>
3053376 3054669 <i>"I don't want to be with you."</i>
3055837 3057172 <i>Go ahead. Say it. Say, say, "I don't..."</i>
3057338 3058423 Say it. You don't wanna be with me.
3058882 3061217 <i>Tell me that and I'll walk away.<br />Say, "I don't want you."</i>
3068058 3068892 Fuck...
3069059 3071603 You'll never fucking matter.
3075482 3077193 What?
3077568 3080321 - You'll never fucking matter.<br />- Fucking matter.
3086785 3088662 - <i>You'll...</i><br />- <i>You'll...</i>
3088830 3090206 - never...<br />- <i>never...</i>
3090790 3091958 - fucking...<br />- <i>fucking...</i>
3092124 3094919 - matter.<br />- <i>matter...</i>
3096963 3098339 She never said that.
3098505 3099465 No.
3099632 3101509 But I bet she thought it.
3103636 3105262 You are so mean!
3105430 3108057 My brain could taste your fingers,<br />and they tasted like hate!
3108766 3111269 And where in God's name<br />is the intimacy coordinator?
3111436 3113688 You're so lost, Mr. Wilson.
3114231 3116483 And long before you came here.
3117984 3120403 This is Baby Knife.<br />She's gonna fuck you in the face now.
3120653 3123615 If you want to kill me,<br />it's going to take more than a little blade.
3123907 3124782 How about six?
3126785 3128620 My boy's wicked strong.
3129121 3130663 That's my big boy.
3130956 3132290 Yes, you are.
3138130 3139715 Well, this has been fun.
3140132 3142300 But the big guy needs to eat<br />and the rent is due.
3145721 3146555 By the way...
3146722 3148140 you're the rent.
3168327 3170163 Come on! Fuck!
3170329 3171414 You comin' or what?
3171581 3172456 Coming!
3192686 3193687 What you thinkin' 'bout?
3193853 3194897 Get the fuck off of me!
3195439 3196315 Almost done.
3196481 3197566 Almost done what?
3197732 3200110 Getting my knife out of your buttocks,<br />pervert!
3200277 3201195 Fuck!
3201361 3203072 Get your mind out of my pants!
3203238 3204073 I'm telling Blake.
3204239 3205282 New rules.
3205825 3206659 I talk now.
3206826 3210245 - That's gonna be very hard on the audience.<br />- Shut the fuck up!
3210996 3211872 Let me fuckin' think.
3212164 3213999 Now we gotta get back to Paradox, right?
3216085 3216919 Right?
3218796 3222091 - Am I allowed to speak now or...<br />- Just nod, asshole.
3223718 3224635 Right.
3224802 3227638 Then we find the others that poor kid, Johnny<br />was talking about before you got him killed!
3227805 3229432 "Poor kid." He's like fifty!
3229599 3232102 Yeah, if there's a chance they know<br />how to get out of here, we find 'em.
3232268 3235646 And make those TVA fuckers fix my shit<br />like you fucking promised!
3235814 3237023 I smell quest.
3239776 3240777 I smell food.
3244197 3247534 So what made you finally wear an<br />honest-to-God costume?
3249244 3251330 Mine's red so they can't see me bleed.
3251497 3254165 But I could see how<br />yellow would be useful too.
3254333 3255876 Have you been checked for ADHD?
3256042 3257085 Mm-mm.
3257336 3259463 But I've had several STDs, which...
3259630 3261340 were probably caused by ADHD.
3261507 3262299 Fuck!
3263759 3264718 What are you looking for?
3266012 3267013 Thank fuck.
3268055 3269849 No, no, no. That's rubbing alcohol.
3270016 3272601 You don't want to drink...<br />Oh, yeah. There you go. Fuck that liver.
3274311 3276022 Good. Okay.
3277064 3278190 What the fuck are those?
3279859 3282654 Back in civilian life, I wear a toupee,<br />but nobody knows.
3285740 3287241 Everybody knows.
3290036 3291746 Wanna talk about what's haunting you, or...
3291913 3293831 should we wait for a third act flashback?
3294499 3295750 Go fuck yourself.
3299087 3299921 You know...
3301798 3303216 in my world, you're...
3305260 3306511 You're well regarded.
3306804 3308096 Yeah, well, not in mine.
3309306 3312517 - They don't like me much in mine either.<br />- You don't say.
3312768 3314394 I wanted to be something, you know. I...
3315478 3317147 Shit, I wanted to be an Avenger.
3317397 3319232 - Fuck the Avengers.<br />- Yeah.
3319733 3321819 I didn't make the cut, though.<br />Same with the X-Men...
3323946 3324947 When my girlfriend left me...
3325113 3326240 - and then I just...<br />- You had a girlfriend?
3326782 3327825 Yeah.
3328326 3329160 Vanessa.
3329827 3331245 When we met, she was a dancer.
3332455 3333456 We had a whole life.
3334748 3335749 It was good.
3336542 3337919 But, oh, boy, I just...
3339879 3341380 Fucked that right up.
3342256 3343299 But you.
3343466 3344592 You were an X-Man.
3344926 3346761 Fuck that. You were the X-Man. You...
3348680 3349848 The Wolverine.
3352225 3353768 He was a hero in my world.
3355687 3356521 Yeah, well...
3357939 3359107 he ain't shit in mine.
3364654 3367157 You said, "Logan was a hero."<br />What happened?
3368032 3368867 He died.
3369618 3370452 How?
3371328 3373830 Well, technically,<br />you were chest-fucked by a tree, but...
3373998 3376583 really, you just ran out of batteries<br />trying to save someone.
3376750 3377584 Who?
3377960 3381255 The shitheels that grew her in a lab<br />called her "X-23." But...
3382006 3383132 she was just a kid.
3383924 3387344 A younger, daintier,<br />somehow meaner version of you.
3387512 3388888 You died trying to save her.
3389263 3390097 It was beautiful.
3390848 3393142 Look, <i>mijo,</i> I know you're hurtin'.
3393893 3397522 My blind, elderly, African-American roommate,<br />Blind Al, always says that...
3397688 3399357 pain teaches us who we are.
3399524 3402067 Sometimes we need to listen to that pain<br />instead of running from it.
3402235 3403903 - Holy shit.<br />- Yeah, she's wise.
3404070 3406447 No, no, no. That's her name?<br />You call her "Blind Al?"
3406614 3407615 Well, she's blind.
3445279 3446530 Look at you!
3446697 3447698 She's coming with us.
3447865 3449741 - No, she's not. Fuck no!<br />- Oh, yes, she is.
3449909 3451828 - Oh, yes...<br />- Sorry!
3452203 3453579 Sorry about that!
3453996 3455122 Come here, girl!
3456082 3457291 Who are you?
3457458 3458751 Oh, I'm Deadpool.
3458918 3460211 And I guess you're Deadpool too.
3460377 3462379 But in here, everybody calls me "Nicepool."
3462797 3465758 Oh, my goodness. Wait till you see Ladypool.<br />She is gorgeous.
3465925 3467302 She just had a baby too. And...
3468052 3468886 Can't even tell.
3469053 3470388 I don't think you're supposed to say that.
3470555 3471389 That's okay.
3472056 3473558 I identify as a feminist.
3473725 3474601 Right.
3476394 3479397 Are those gold-plated,<br />...50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros?
3479564 3480690 'Course.
3481066 3482234 To match my ear huggie.
3482400 3483276 Can I have 'em?
3484236 3485570 Over my dead body.
3485904 3486780 You're fun.
3486947 3491284 And I guess you've already met Mary Puppins.<br />AKA Dogpool.
3491451 3492494 Careful where you put your hands.
3492661 3495497 She's ninety percent g-spot,<br />and she'll let you know it.
3495664 3499084 You let this little flirt out of your sight<br />for one second and...
3499251 3501294 she starts shopping for a new papa.
3501462 3505924 If you can't be a responsible pet owner, then<br />maybe you don't deserve this little unicorn.
3506217 3507885 Guilty on all charges, Your Honor.
3508427 3509428 Shan't happen again.
3509595 3510929 Why are you so nice?
3511097 3512473 Oh, it costs nothing to be kind.
3512640 3514392 Shutting the fuck up is also free.
3515059 3515935 This is Logan.
3516102 3518855 He's usually shirtless,<br />but he's let himself go since the divorce.
3520189 3521732 Where's your mask?
3524443 3525278 Come on, guys.
3526946 3528031 Ugh, this guy.
3528197 3529699 We're looking for a group of survivors.
3529866 3530700 Oh, they're out there.
3530867 3534245 Yeah, but merc to merc, you better hope<br />that you don't run into the Deadpool corps.
3534412 3535371 Yeah, they're crazy.
3535539 3538500 They will chop you up into a thousand pieces<br />and hide you all over The Void.
3538667 3540502 If they could only process<br />their childhood trauma...
3540669 3542254 they'd go on one heck of a healing journey.
3542421 3543422 Look, we're headed for the borderlands.
3543588 3544548 You know where it is?
3544839 3549053 Yeah, that... That's twelve klicks due west.<br />I can lend you my ride, if you like.
3549219 3550929 It would be my honor.
3554599 3556643 No, no, no. Absolutely not.
3556811 3558687 Uh-uh. What the...<br />No! No!
3558854 3559772 Just get in the car.
3559939 3561023 This isn't a car.
3561190 3563400 This is a Honda fuckin' Odyssey.
3563567 3565444 Throttle response sucks a cock.
3565611 3566737 Dated infotainment system.
3566904 3569532 When Honda saw that untreated chlamydia<br />was makin' a comeback...
3569699 3572493 they invented the Honda Odyssey to compete.
3572660 3575371 Get in the fucking car.
3575705 3577498 She'll get you there safe and sound.
3577665 3579124 Old Betsy always does.
3580000 3581919 You're gonna have to<br />give me my dog back, though.
3582295 3584797 I know. Listen. Yes, child.
3584964 3587425 If you ever wanna give her up,<br />or if she needs a new home...
3587592 3589469 or if something<br />should happen to you...
3589635 3590846 I'd love to be her papa.
3591554 3593181 What would ever happen to me?
3593348 3594390 Lots of stuff.
3598103 3600355 - Jesus.<br />- No! We're running away.
3601397 3603108 - Give me that.<br />- The corn was too dense, girl!
3603274 3604109 - There.<br />- Come here!
3604275 3605527 - Fuck!<br />- Hello!
3607821 3608822 Bye.
3634641 3635642 Okay, I'm just gonna ask...
3636017 3637184 What's with the suit?
3637351 3638811 First thing I did when I flamed out...
3638978 3639979 - I took mine off.<br />- Drop it.
3640146 3641105 It's not that ugly.
3641272 3642857 - Stop talking about my suit.<br />- Did you make it yourself?
3643024 3644442 - Been there.<br />- Quit. Now.
3644609 3647695 The X-Men make you wear it?<br />Those sons of fuckin' bitches.
3647862 3649364 They are not your friends,<br />I'll tell you that.
3649531 3650532 Friends don't let friends...
3650698 3653576 leave the house lookin' like they<br />fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams.
3653743 3654827 Shut the fuck up about this, or...
3654994 3657205 Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />Watch your frown lines, angel baby.
3657372 3659541 - I'm just trying to bond a little bit.<br />- Yeah, well, then talk about somethin' else.
3659707 3660625 Fine.
3667800 3668842 Stop it.
3670552 3671386 If they can fix your world...
3671553 3673180 what's the first thing you're gonna do<br />when you get out of here?
3673346 3676475 Get some rubbing alcohol shots,<br />maybe a wiper fluid chaser?
3676642 3677560 What did you say?
3677726 3679352 I said when you get back,<br />what's the first thing you're gonna do?
3679520 3680854 No, no, no. Before that.
3682105 3683774 If... they can fix your world?
3687903 3689363 What do you mean, "if?"
3690198 3691031 - I mean...<br />- You lied to me.
3691199 3693742 You don't have a fucking clue<br />if they can help me fix things, do you?
3693909 3694994 No. I, I mean...
3695661 3698456 Fuck! Fuck! I didn't lie!
3698622 3701292 - You lied!<br />- No! I made an educated wish!
3703169 3704128 Because I need you.
3705463 3708466 This. This is why. Right here.
3709508 3711010 'Cause if we don't do something, they die.
3711427 3713346 I don't know anything about saving worlds.
3713513 3715056 And why would I even care?
3715223 3718142 Because my entire world<br />is right here in this picture.
3718602 3720604 It's only nine people...
3720770 3722814 and I have no idea how to save it alone.
3723940 3726025 I know how to fuck people up for money.<br />But you...
3726193 3727777 you know how to save 'em!
3729029 3730239 At least the other Wolverine did.
3731490 3733909 Fuck! I guess I'm stuck with the worst one.
3734076 3736328 Did you say you made...
3736495 3739790 an educated fucking wish?
3739957 3742084 They call me "The Merc with the Mouth."
3742251 3746130 They don't call me "Truthful Timmy,<br />the Blowjob Queen of Saskatoon."
3750009 3750926 One more word.
3752219 3753679 Please give me one.
3757308 3758476 Gubernatorial.
3759227 3760228 Oh, fuck!
3761854 3763273 You know what? You're a fucking joke.
3765066 3766484 No wonder the Avengers didn't take you.
3766651 3768778 Or the X-Men.<br />And they'll take fucking anyone.
3769279 3770655 I mean, you are...
3770821 3774367 a ridiculous, immature, half-wit moron.
3774993 3776703 I have never met...
3776870 3778079 a sadder...
3778246 3780624 more attention-starved,<br />jabbering little prick...
3780791 3784210 in my entire life. And that says a lot,<br />'cause I've been alive...
3784377 3788214 for more than two hundred fuckin' years,<br />and I'll tell you...
3788382 3792594 that bald chick was right about one thing.<br />You will never save the world!
3792761 3795264 You couldn't even save a relationship...
3795431 3797308 with a goddamn stripper!
3797474 3799935 And motherfucker,<br />I wish I could say you'd die alone...
3800102 3803022 but it's one of God's best jokes<br />that you can't die...
3803189 3804690 except that's on all of us!
3808778 3811238 Oh, you got nothing to say, Mouth?
3819914 3821583 I'm gonna fight you now.
3823793 3825044 Oh, are you?
3835763 3837765 Mm. Not talkin' now, are ya?
3844439 3845482 You dirty bitch.
3861206 3862040 Whoo!
3878641 3879851 No, no, no!
3898703 3899538 Baby Knife!
3903292 3906378 I take it all back.<br />The Honda Odyssey fucks hard.
3906795 3908255 Too bad you don't, needle dick.
3908422 3909631 Oh, we're just gettin' started, bub.
3914219 3915470 Oh, you... Fuck!
3968442 3969275 Thor!
3972363 3973280 Where are we?
3973447 3976074 No clue, but... I like it here.
3984250 3986085 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
4035177 4036094 Okay.
4037012 4039848 Look at you... all. You must be the others.
4040558 4041392 Terrific.
4041725 4045062 So just to refresh, you are...
4045229 4047606 - Wonder... Elektra? Yes. Who could forget?<br />- Elektra.
4048441 4053154 And you. I was not expecting to see you here.<br />I thought you were, you know...
4053321 4054280 retired.
4055531 4056365 Retarded?
4057867 4058827 "Retired."
4058993 4061204 I'm already in The Void.<br />I'm not trying to get canceled again.
4061370 4062121 I don't like you.
4062288 4063122 You never did.
4064833 4068545 And who's this succulent reminder<br />of my own inadequacies?
4068712 4069796 Look at you.
4070463 4072549 You look like the<br />superhero version of Hawkeye.
4073174 4075969 The name's Remy LeBeau, <i>Le Diable Blanc.</i>
4076678 4077637 But you can call me the Gambit.
4077804 4080557 It's been a while since I've seen<br /><i>Sling Blade</i>. Hit me again.
4081641 4082601 They call me the Gambit.
4082767 4085229 Do they? Are you sure you didn't just<br />really, really want them to...
4085395 4086521 but it never quite worked out?
4089399 4091693 You know,<br />we never had a Wolverine up in here.
4092486 4095447 But I can tell you now,<br />it's just a common courtesy to ask...
4095614 4097282 before you drink up all of my liquor.
4097574 4099618 Well, it's a good thing I don't give a fuck.
4102830 4103663 Fuck.
4106791 4107917 So embarrassing.
4110129 4112797 Well, now that that's settled, look,<br />we came a long way to find you three.
4112965 4113758 There's four of us.
4113923 4115800 There's four... Hey, wait. Is it Magneto?
4116636 4118971 Dear sweet God in heaven,<br />let it be Magneto...
4119139 4120014 - because with him...<br />- He's dead.
4120180 4122057 Fuck!<br />Now Disney gets cheap?
4122225 4125353 It's like Pinocchio jammed his face in my ass<br />and started lying like crazy.
4125520 4126604 Ooh, you nasty!
4128773 4131484 Not a single word. What do you do exactly?
4131651 4134237 Charge the playing cards<br />and make 'em go boom!
4134404 4136364 Your power's close up magic. That's good.
4136531 4137948 We're not totally fucked at all.
4138116 4139618 So who brought us here?
4139785 4140701 That would be me.
4151046 4151880 Don't make me regret it.
4154132 4157052 Holy shit. Logan. That's her.<br />That's X-23.
4157553 4159055 She's the one I told you about.
4163599 4165686 Hey, how did you all get stuck in The Void?
4165852 4167228 There was a knock at the door.
4167396 4169315 - TVA sent me here.<br />- Me, too.
4169480 4171650 Well, maybe I was born here.<br />It's, it's hard to know for sure.
4171983 4174195 TVA decided our universe was dying.
4175486 4177363 And I never even got a chance<br />to fight for it.
4180201 4182286 People like us don't go quietly.
4182454 4184288 TVA knows that, so they took us out.
4184996 4186998 The answer is yes. I'm in.
4187166 4188585 - In what?<br />- A team.
4189251 4191128 Me, you, you, and me. All of us together.
4191296 4192379 Let's get the fuck out of this place.
4192547 4195967 - Don't listen to him. He's a fucking liar!<br />- It was an educated wish!
4197009 4197844 Look.
4199387 4201056 We've been inside Cassandra's lair.
4201389 4203934 The only way out of The Void<br />is through her.
4204101 4205853 She can get us home. She told us.
4206019 4207562 Wait a minute, you've been inside?
4208355 4210148 - And you made it out alive?<br />- Bullshit.
4210315 4211900 - Nobody's ever done that.<br />- We did.
4212067 4214319 Every time one of us<br />has gone up against her...
4214737 4215571 they die.
4216029 4218741 The Punisher, The Quicksilver, The Daredevil.
4218907 4220242 Daredevil? I'm so sorry.
4220409 4221577 - It's fine.<br />- Okay.
4223871 4226332 Even that sweet, baby angel, Johnny Storm.
4227082 4228626 He up and gone missing like...
4228917 4229918 what, two days ago?
4230628 4232338 Ugh. That's so sad.
4233047 4235799 Wherever this Johnny fella is,<br />I'm sure he's thriving.
4236968 4240054 Look, there's, there's strength in numbers.<br />All right? Us...
4240221 4241597 plus, you guys. We can put Cassandra...
4241765 4243892 over our knee and force her<br />to let us out of The Void.
4244058 4245644 I know what it means to feel self-doubt.
4245810 4247228 - I don't feel that at all.<br />- I'm good.
4247395 4249313 Gnawing at your gut like a coked-up tapeworm.
4249480 4251149 It's like you're<br />holding up a mirror to my soul.
4251315 4253943 You guys may not have been able to<br />save your universes.
4254110 4255570 But you can avenge them.
4256363 4257739 It's what Johnny would have wanted.
4257906 4260575 Wait. You knew Johnny?
4261576 4262744 Oh, yeah.
4262911 4264746 Dickhead here talked him into a team up...
4264913 4267291 and Johnny came down<br />with a little case of the deads.
4267457 4268708 No, no, no. We don't know that.
4268875 4271003 It was just a flesh wound.<br />He may have survived.
4271170 4273755 If he survived that, he is prayin' for death.
4273923 4276216 - Thank you, Doctor Wolverine!<br />- Spill it!
4276383 4277592 What'd you do to Johnny, huh?
4277760 4278969 Talk or I'm gonna start dealin'.
4279136 4280345 Okay. Okay. Hey, hey, hey.
4281013 4281847 Look.
4282014 4284308 He ran his fat-ass mouth about Cassandra.
4284474 4286185 Then she zip-zapped his skin...
4286351 4288395 leaving his organs to<br />splash crudely onto the ground...
4288563 4291106 while the soil greedily drank his blood.<br />It was horrible.
4291273 4292608 He was like a brother to me.
4293233 4296237 Look, he died<br />before he could make a difference. But...
4296404 4298739 Look, maybe you couldn't save your worlds,<br />but...
4298906 4301451 but Jesus Christ, you can save mine!
4301617 4304079 I don't give a shit about your world, but...
4304245 4307165 if these two made it out of there alive,<br />maybe together...
4307332 4308959 we can get back in.<br />And take her down.
4309125 4311669 Where I come from,<br />we call that suicide, <i>Chère.</i>
4312128 4315841 If we can block her psychic powers,<br />we can get a leg up. I know it.
4316007 4317550 Now I know Magneto's dead.
4318093 4320011 But I'd venture to guess that his helmet...
4320178 4322556 - is lying around here somewhere...<br />- Cassandra melted the helmet.
4322723 4323849 - Fuck!<br />- After she killed him.
4324015 4324933 Fuck!
4325100 4325892 She don't play.
4326059 4328979 She knows that helmet was the only way<br />to protect anyone from her powers.
4329145 4331482 The only other helmet that strong is<br />Juggernaut's, but...
4331648 4333734 - he works for Cassandra.<br />- Juggernaut's helmet. That's it.
4333900 4335444 Yeah, and we done be knowing<br />that lid ain't comin' off...
4335611 4337904 - without that dome gonna come off wit'it.<br />- I'm so sorry, beautiful.
4338072 4341408 I want this to be gentle.<br />Who is your dialect coach? The Minions?
4341575 4344411 I feel like<br />we are missing critical exposition here.
4345913 4348624 I'm sick of this shit.<br />I'm sick of hiding.
4349917 4351836 Let's face it, our worlds forgot about us.
4352003 4353630 Or never learned about us.
4353796 4355089 The heroes we were.
4355256 4356382 Lives we saved.
4356549 4358009 Or wanted to save.
4358175 4359844 Maybe these two are our chance.
4361471 4362555 To be remembered.
4363014 4364098 The way we deserve.
4365266 4366225 Yes.
4366393 4367310 An ending.
4368185 4369312 - Legacy.<br />- Yes!
4369479 4371063 Yes! Let this man cook.
4371231 4372482 This is what I'm talking about.
4372649 4374484 Big slow-motion fights, sad music.
4374651 4377612 Everybody working together. Who knows if you<br />live or die? That sorta thing.
4377779 4379781 - Who's ready?<br />- I was born ready.
4379948 4380949 Yes!<br />Gambit?
4381116 4384036 I ain't know my daddy,<br />but I'm sure I shot out of his dick ready.
4384202 4385954 Jesus Christ, that is graphic.
4386121 4387998 Yeah. He was layin' them buttery nuts<br />all up in my mama...
4388165 4389958 and I shot out there and I said,<br />"What's up, Doc?"
4390793 4394004 Johnny must have loved you.<br />X-23, what's it gonna be?
4394880 4395881 The name's Laura.
4396048 4398926 - Let's fucking go.<br />- Let's fucking go!
4399092 4400719 - It's on like chicken and corn.<br />- Yeah!
4400886 4402805 - We're doing this.<br />- You're all fuckin' dead.
4402971 4405015 My God! Read the room.
4416152 4419072 Hey, hey. I'm not lookin' for company.<br />Get out of here.
4421282 4422325 You remind me of him.
4422951 4424410 Angry. Drunk. Mean...
4424786 4426746 - Sounds like a great guy...<br />- Wasn't finished.
4428748 4430249 Showed up when it mattered the most.
4432544 4434128 Couldn't help it.
4437549 4438508 You might not know it, but...
4439968 4441094 you're a good man, Logan.
4443430 4446141 You might not know it, but apparently,<br />I'm the worst Logan.
4448352 4449979 I got to have a life because of you.
4453107 4454524 I got to grow up because of you.
4456777 4457862 A lot of kids did.
4458528 4460447 A lot of kids didn't grow up because of me.
4462700 4464201 Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.
4465620 4467079 That suit says different.
4467747 4468998 Yeah. Do you like it?
4471751 4473378 Scott used to beg me to wear it.
4475713 4478216 So did Jean, Storm, Beast.
4480343 4481344 All of them.
4482637 4485848 They wanted me to be part of the team,<br />but I wouldn't.
4486349 4489477 Told 'em they all look fucking ridiculous.<br />I mean...
4491521 4493982 I couldn't have 'em thinkin'<br />I wanted to be there.
4499821 4502824 And then one day, while I was off on my own,<br />the humans came...
4503700 4504993 and went mutant hunting.
4506327 4507413 I can guess the rest.
4507579 4508414 No, no, let me...
4510123 4511082 Let me say it. I...
4513877 4514836 I need to say it.
4517714 4520842 By the time I stumbled home<br />shitfaced from the bar, it was too late.
4525472 4526473 They were dead. Every...
4533189 4536150 This suit's all I got to remind me of<br />who they were.
4538152 4539028 And what I did.
4552334 4553793 We're headed to Cassandra's at sunup.
4554836 4556629 Have fun. Not my fight.
4560133 4561509 We won't pull this off without you.
4568809 4571937 Hey. Whoever you think I am,<br />you got the wrong guy.
4574898 4576024 You were always the wrong guy.
4602260 4603094 What?
4603261 4604721 Alioth didn't get them.
4605680 4607891 Cassandra wanted to<br />play with them herself first.
4608057 4608892 <i>They got away.</i>
4609058 4610685 - Did they find the others?<br />- No.
4610852 4612061 Good. All right. Phew.
4612228 4613271 <i>The others found them.</i>
4613438 4616065 Oh, very cute. Well done, Pyro.<br />Classic bait and switch.
4616232 4617692 - <i>You really got me there.</i><br />- Relax.
4618652 4620945 If they come after Nova, she'll handle it.
4621112 4623157 Cassandra is a lunatic wild card.
4623323 4624949 Why do you think we put her there<br />in the first place?
4625534 4627494 Thank God she's never chosen<br />to leave The Void.
4627661 4630205 The Time Ripper is hours away<br />from completion.
4630372 4631498 I cannot take any chances.
4631665 4632707 Well, maybe not.
4632875 4633959 <i>But I can.</i>
4634126 4635085 For a price.
4635252 4636711 <i>Why do you have to<br />say it in that silly voice?</i>
4636879 4637963 It's so icky.
4638130 4638964 <i>You want it done or not?</i>
4639131 4639965 All right. Your price.
4640132 4641383 <i>Take her out.</i>
4642051 4643594 Ugh. Mutants.
4665825 4666910 Ooh! Look at that there!
4667077 4669787 You see them biggum hands come closed.<br />Ain't not a wonna gettin' up inside there.
4669955 4671206 I think what Gambit's<br />trying to say is...
4671372 4674084 getting Juggernaut's helmet<br />ain't gonna be easy.
4674250 4675877 I'm just making stuff up at this...
4676044 4677754 - Yeah. Tilt up to Blade.<br />- Gun!
4682509 4683719 Where'd he get that little beauty?
4684177 4686262 That's Punisher's AT4.
4686430 4688432 Which Punisher?<br />There's been like five of them.
4688599 4689891 There's only been one Blade...
4690476 4692394 and there's only ever gonna be one Blade.
4696440 4697608 Incoming!
4764385 4766554 Ooh, this is gonna be good.
4766720 4768972 You know how long I've been waiting for this?
4769140 4771309 Whoo!<br />I'm about to make a name for myself here.
4771475 4773311 I don't think you guys walk away from this.
4773477 4775479 You just make sure<br />people know what happened here today.
4775646 4777606 And when you get out of here,<br />you have a drink for me, yeah?
4777773 4780109 You just stay on our six and get inside.
4780276 4782195 We'll make sure you get the package.
4782696 4783988 And we'll get our ending.
4854185 4855228 And boom!
4886969 4889096 Some motherfuckers still trying<br />to ice skate uphill.
4896145 4898064 You two escaping, I could live with.
4898440 4901108 But coming back? Willingly?
4902735 4904487 Boys are so silly.
4904654 4905780 I just need to get home.
4905947 4908241 Well, that's not on the menu, I'm afraid.
4908408 4911661 It's death or enslavement.<br />À la carte, of course.
4911828 4912829 Upsy-daisy.
4918668 4919544 Finally...
4919711 4921588 it's nice to give someone else<br />a chance to talk.
4921754 4923173 Not my strong suit.
4941484 4942693 You shouldn't have done that.
4966300 4968720 You are an interesting one, aren't you?
4969303 4973266 I do feel like<br />you get lost behind all of his...
4975602 4978104 Deadpools are<br />a dime a dozen here in The Void.
4979063 4980440 But you...
4980940 4983943 What's going on in here?
4997499 4998625 Interesting...
4999794 5001712 Not what I expected back here.
5002797 5004006 Behind the anger.
5008135 5009053 You're hiding.
5009387 5010220 From them.
5011431 5013098 From all the ones you let down.
5015768 5016977 So much pain.
5019564 5020440 I walked away.
5021857 5023401 They called after me and I...
5023568 5025361 I walked away.
5025528 5027155 I always do.
5027322 5029032 - <i>Logan!</i><br />- I know.
5030450 5031743 That's not all you did.
5031910 5033328 Is it?
5036873 5038249 You found them.
5039250 5040251 The X-Men.
5045674 5046675 Dead.
5049428 5050637 Piled like wood.
5052348 5053515 <i>What did you do?</i>
5056227 5057436 I started killing.
5058229 5060731 And I couldn't stop. I didn't wanna stop.
5062024 5064861 <i>All those bad men.</i>
5068614 5070199 It's not just the bad ones.
5071868 5073035 My little animal.
5075913 5078708 And I turned the whole world<br />against the X-Men.
5079083 5080084 Blade!
5085673 5086883 Just once...
5088843 5091388 I wanna be the man<br />that Charles thought I was.
5092597 5093723 Logan...
5095308 5098979 in The Void you can be what you are.
5101398 5102858 I just wanna be free.
5103650 5105110 I can set you free.
5116747 5121877 I can silence all those voices.
5128717 5129718 I've got you.
5132346 5133347 I've got you.
5134098 5134933 No.
5136392 5137435 I got you.
5146110 5147737 Get it off!
5147904 5151032 You're gonna send us home,<br />or I'm gonna twist your fucking head off.
5151199 5152283 Why are you laughing?
5152951 5156746 I can't send you home<br />unless you get this thing off my head.
5157331 5158457 And as soon as you do that...
5158623 5161501 I'm going to boil your brains<br />on an atomic level whilst...
5161668 5164254 flicking my bean to the Enya box set.
5164421 5165464 There's an Enya box set?
5165630 5166881 Either you kill me...
5167049 5168175 or I kill you.
5169259 5170802 Both wonderful options.
5171345 5172179 You want me to do it?
5172637 5173513 No, I'll do it.
5173680 5175725 I have her neck right here.<br />It's really no problem.
5175891 5176600 You'll screw it up.
5176767 5179311 Oh, come on, Mr. PG-13,<br />except the last one!
5180187 5181271 What the fuck?
5183608 5185860 You have no idea what it's like!
5186026 5188946 Day after day. Shovel the shit.
5189113 5190448 Fetch the meats.
5190615 5192575 I have spent my entire...
5195578 5197079 Not everyone gets a speech.
5199039 5200041 She's gonna die.
5200208 5201667 Okay. Hey, hey. If I take this helmet off...
5201834 5203628 - do you promise you won't kill us?<br />- Fuck!
5203794 5204629 I promise...
5204795 5206589 I will kill you first thing.
5206756 5208008 Why are you like this?
5208174 5209425 I wish I knew.
5209592 5210468 Take it off.
5210635 5211511 - What?<br />- Take it off.
5211677 5212512 - Why?<br />- Just take it off.
5212679 5215431 - This is our only chance to fix our shit!<br />- Take it off!
5217350 5218602 I am wearing this suit.
5219811 5221938 And that means a lot of things,<br />but most of all...
5223440 5224566 it means I'm an X-Man.
5225692 5227110 And I know your brother.
5229446 5230947 As much as I want to fucking kill you...
5231114 5233617 every bone in my body<br />wants to fucking kill you...
5233784 5236787 he would not let me stand here<br />and watch you die!
5239248 5240457 Take your hands off.
5242126 5243377 This is for him.
5245296 5246547 This is for Charles.
5257183 5259811 Hey, no, no, no!<br />Don't you dare do me like Johnny!
5266150 5267235 My brother loved you.
5269112 5270197 He loved all of us.
5273283 5274367 Must be nice.
5275493 5276786 He would've loved you, too.
5279664 5280833 If he knew about you...
5282625 5284127 if he knew where you were...
5284294 5287339 he would've torn a hole in the fucking<br />universe to bring you home.
5291176 5292260 This is my home.
5293345 5295598 Well, then at least let us save his.
5299768 5301270 You want to hear something crazy?
5303231 5306109 An amateur magician<br />rolled through here a while back.
5307025 5308486 I killed him, of course.
5309195 5311447 Wore his skin around for four days.
5312490 5313324 But...
5313491 5314909 I found this...
5315076 5316911 little trinket...
5317078 5319205 on his lovely fingers.
5319372 5320539 Strange!
5323627 5325754 - Marvel sparkle circle.<br />- What is that?
5326671 5328590 This is your way home.
5328757 5332218 I do owe you for saving my life.<br />But let's keep things interesting.
5332386 5335680 I'd say you have about four seconds<br />before you're Alioth's food.
5340560 5341395 Race ya.
5425064 5426648 {\an8}And as I said<br />we've got a standard three-year...
5426816 5428109 {\an8}bumper to bumper warranty.
5428275 5430027 Glad you gave us a second chance.
5430194 5433740 And don't worry. Wade and I are a team,<br />so I'll see he gets half the commission...
5436325 5438536 That feels like a Kia.
5438703 5440330 It's a fucking Kia Carnival, isn't it?
5442206 5445042 Holy shit. That's Deadpool.
5445210 5446336 And that's Wolverine.
5446503 5447587 You're damn straight it is.
5447754 5448671 Fox killed him.
5448838 5451383 Disney brought him back. They're going<br />to make him do this 'til he's 90.
5451924 5452884 Let's go.
5453676 5454761 I'll clock you out!
5455137 5456346 Forever!
5457055 5458056 Forever.
5465438 5466649 Wakey-wakey.
5466815 5467816 God?
5469568 5472279 Now you put all these bullets in my belly...
5472988 5474532 and I'm gonna find out why.
5476950 5478327 I'll just say it.
5479036 5480829 You don't have to stick your fingers in me.
5480996 5483249 Jesus, just ask sometimes.
5483624 5484667 Fine.
5485876 5486877 Really?
5487545 5488796 Hands in pockets.
5490339 5491507 Guy named Paradox.
5492425 5493676 He said he'd get me out of The Void.
5493843 5495636 All I know is he works for the TVA.
5495804 5496805 The TVA.
5496971 5498014 We had an agreement.
5498306 5499849 I don't think this guy cares.
5501142 5502185 He will.
5502686 5503728 Hey, people!
5504062 5506189 How much longer<br />before the Time Ripper is active?
5506355 5508191 We're running the final safety checks.
5508357 5510318 Okay. All right.<br />Thanks for all your hard work, Ralph.
5510485 5511861 - Take your time.<br />- Really?
5512028 5513572 No, you drooling boob!
5513738 5514823 No! We have company.
5514989 5517992 Cancel the safety checks.<br />We need to be live now!
5518327 5519786 I hate you so much.
5521996 5522997 No! Stop!
5523165 5524749 Piss off! You're too late.
5524916 5526668 - You're fuckin' done.<br />- Why was Thor crying?
5526835 5527836 How dare you!
5528003 5530172 No one comes back from The Void.
5530339 5531799 Tell that to Cassandra Nova.
5540641 5542434 Paradox.<br />We have a problem.
5545521 5546731 Paradox.
5549066 5551527 Well, you are doughier than<br />you looked in Pyro's head.
5551694 5552862 You tried to kill me.
5553028 5554029 I literally have no...
5554989 5558659 <i>You come for the king,<br />you better kill the king.</i>
5559577 5561955 Welcome to the skull fuck club, Paradox.
5562122 5564249 You know she doesn't wash that hand.
5566001 5567127 What's this?
5568461 5569796 A Time Ripper?
5569963 5571673 - Naughty boy.<br />- Oh, no. We're on it.
5571840 5573466 We're gonna head down<br />and dismantle that thing now.
5573634 5575927 We got ya, boo.<br />You just keep playing those keys.
5576094 5577596 I don't want to destroy it.
5578263 5579598 I want to use it.
5580140 5582643 Now, shoo.<br />Mummy and Daddy are having a conversation.
5589358 5591152 You know, the funny thing is...
5591318 5592778 I was happy in The Void.
5593820 5596740 You sent your trash to me.<br />Alioth and I cleaned it up.
5596907 5598867 Everyone was happy.
5599743 5602830 And then you had to go<br />and piss on my side of the fence.
5602997 5605166 And so now the fence must come down.
5605875 5607710 I'm going to use your little Time Ripper.
5607877 5610462 And I'm going to destroy this universe...
5610630 5613340 and the next and the next and the next...
5613508 5617094 until all that's left is The Void.
5617261 5619138 And I get to play God.
5619681 5620682 Come on.
5621140 5623976 Now you're going to show me how<br />to use this fancy gadget of yours.
5624143 5627522 And don't worry, I've called some friends<br />to make sure we're not disturbed.
5631109 5633653 Sorry to bother, madam,<br />but there's something you need to see.
5634196 5638200 We're getting indications of an unsanctioned<br />Time Ripper activating on Earth-10005.
5640493 5641703 Whose district is that?
5642079 5642996 Paradox.
5655050 5657260 Well, thank you so much<br />for your help, darling.
5657428 5659847 God. Good to get out of that head.
5660013 5661515 What a mess!
5668856 5669690 Stop!
5670191 5672193 Let's give it a beat for the extras to clear.
5672360 5674403 Go, go, go!<br />Oh, my God!
5679200 5681870 - Oh. My. God.<br />- Fuck.
5689628 5691004 It's her!
5692255 5693382 Come on, girl!
5700805 5702015 Come on, girl!
5716781 5717907 That's my girl!
5718073 5721368 We don't have to be apart ever, ever again.<br />Never, ever...
5721536 5722620 - Sorry!<br />- Fuck!
5723746 5725540 What's Café Gratitude doing here?
5725706 5726957 Sorry about that.
5727124 5730461 Tremble not, sweet Mary Puppins.<br />I'll handle him.
5731086 5732129 Come here, girl.<br />Papa's here.
5732297 5734715 Hey, do not insult<br />this animal's autonomy.
5735425 5737468 She can decide who her papa is.
5737635 5738678 What's it gonna be, girl, huh?
5738844 5741347 Original recipe or Van Milder here?
5741973 5744851 That's funny.<br />I can gently tap the fourth wall too.
5745351 5746519 <i>The Proposal.</i>
5748271 5749272 The fuck was that?
5749439 5751607 - Bitch, you think that's what I do?<br />- Both of you shut up.
5753109 5754110 You smell somethin'?
5754277 5755111 Yeah, you.
5755987 5757573 A lot of you.
5772754 5775006 Told you there were<br />a lot of Deadpools over there.
5786560 5787729 That's bad.
5810252 5811419 I take it they're not friendly.
5811586 5812462 Goodness, no.
5812629 5814672 Sorry about this, boys.<br />Mission over.
5814839 5817509 Cause of death,<br />one hundred kill-thirsty Deadpools.
5817675 5818760 They're dumb.
5818927 5820678 But they can fight.<br />Not me, though.
5820846 5823056 Would love to get in the mix<br />but I have low bone density...
5823223 5824725 and I have to keep my face safe.
5825684 5826685 - Hold, please.<br />- Oh, God.
5826852 5828061 All right. Look.
5828729 5829730 Guys!
5830939 5832691 Deadpool Prime here.
5832858 5834317 - Our fight isn't with you...<br />- Hey!
5834485 5838113 When I want your opinion,<br />I'll take Wolverine's dick out of your mouth.
5838281 5839865 That's Kidpool.<br />She's the dirtiest.
5840032 5841284 Can we just be done?
5841450 5842993 We're just getting started.
5843161 5846455 No, no, no. With the whole multiverse thing.
5847373 5848374 It's not great.
5848541 5850001 It's just been miss...
5850459 5851961 after miss...
5852128 5853838 after miss.
5854213 5856549 Look, <i>The Wizard of Oz</i><br />did the multiverse first...
5856715 5859010 and they did it best.<br />The gays knew it.
5859468 5860720 But we didn't listen.
5860887 5863640 Let's just take the L and move on.
5863807 5866142 I think it's been steadily great<br />since <i>Endgame.</i>
5866309 5867769 What are you talking about?
5867936 5869396 The multiverse is over.
5869563 5872441 Cassandy gonna destroy<br />the fuck outta every timeline.
5872607 5874901 - Y'all can't do shit about it.<br />- Do you not get it?
5875068 5877279 If we don't go down to the subway<br />and stop her, we all die.
5877446 5879698 Say, the boss lady don't want<br />no disturbances.
5879864 5882576 You wanna get down to the subway,<br />you gotta go through us.
5882742 5883702 Uzi time, baby.
5883994 5884995 Uzi time, baby.
5885162 5886163 Look alive!
5895630 5897299 - I think I'm hit.<br />- No shit.
5897466 5898383 You did that on purpose.
5898550 5900094 I did no such thing!
5900260 5901261 Listen to me, gorgeous.
5901428 5902680 How long does it take for you to regenerate?
5902847 5904098 Regenerate?
5910313 5912106 You really are God's perfect idiot,<br />aren't you?
5912273 5913649 - I'm okay.<br />- How dare you!
5913816 5915735 You insensitive son of a bitch!
5915901 5917820 How was I supposed to know<br />he doesn't regenerate?
5917987 5919114 I'm not a medicine woman.
5919572 5920823 Look. A donut cart.
5920991 5922075 - They're practically hospitals.<br />- What?
5922242 5924077 - They sell portable triage units.<br />- They don't.
5924244 5925786 - I'm gonna get you to safety.<br />- He's not.
5925954 5927122 Deep breath.
5935505 5937508 Hey, why are we stopping?
5937674 5938884 I'm just catching my breath.
5939050 5941637 What, are your legs on vacation?<br />You're dead weight!
5941803 5943389 That's because I'm paralyzed.
5943555 5945557 We all have problems.<br />Listen to me.
5945724 5946725 You're gonna live.
5947851 5949102 Look at me, Nicepool.
5953065 5954233 You're gonna live.
5954941 5956193 Say it!
5956735 5958070 I'm gonna live.
5958362 5960406 Say it with me.<br />You're gonna live.
5960572 5962741 I'm gonna live!
5964076 5966120 Say it louder!
5966287 5967454 I'm gonna live...
5976380 5977382 Hold your fire!
5979717 5981010 Sweet little puppy.
5991854 5994316 God damn it!<br />I don't think he's gonna make it.
5994482 5996568 God, he loved his face.
5996734 5999112 I can taste his final thought.
5999279 6000823 He was so afraid.
6000989 6001949 But he died a hero.
6002115 6004034 He died from murder, you dumb fuck.
6004201 6005994 And all I have to remember him by...
6006912 6010583 are these two gold-plated,<br />...50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros.
6011041 6012000 This is for him.
6012626 6013794 Are you ready?
6014378 6016129 I get to kill a hundred yous?
6016297 6017506 Fuck yeah, I'm ready.
6018591 6019883 Hey, you don't want to see this, bub.
6020050 6021344 That's a good girl.
6058298 6059674 Holy shit.
6059841 6061926 You save the good stuff<br />for special occasions?
6062094 6063345 Killing mostly.
6063512 6065847 What's the wind resistance<br />on those blowjob handles?
6067141 6070394 I'm sorry.<br />I'm just a catty bitch when I'm jealous.
6070560 6071812 All right, let's do this.
6072187 6073397 Maximum effort.
6113104 6114189 You're dead.
6140091 6141342 Motherfucker.
6142259 6143886 I wish I were deaf.
6163740 6165575 I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die.
6165742 6166784 I don't wanna...
6180465 6181633 Come on.
6181800 6182801 I blew it.
6182968 6185012 After all that, the only thing<br />they're gonna remember...
6185178 6186889 is that God awful dismount!
6191727 6193228 What you laughing at,<br />you little fucker?
6193562 6194688 Uh-oh.
6194855 6195898 Uh-oh.
6200110 6201695 I guess these ones regenerate.
6203822 6206200 Come on. We don't have time for this.
6206367 6207410 Deadpools!
6207576 6208661 Stand down.
6219172 6220674 This Deadpool's with me.
6220840 6222050 Oh, no.
6222216 6223426 Holy shit.
6223593 6224803 That's fuckin' Peter!
6228014 6229849 Wait, you...<br />You guys know Peter?
6230016 6232143 You kidding me? Every Deadpool has a Peter.
6232311 6235897 Shit. Peter's a goddamn legend<br />in every Deadpool's world.
6236064 6237149 Peter<i>-san.</i>
6245532 6247617 Peter. Peter. Peter.
6253665 6255209 Enjoy my Peter.
6282778 6285240 Oh, now you're here.<br />Oh, well, you're too late. It's all over.
6285406 6286241 Not yet, it's not.
6286407 6288076 Whoa. No, no, no. We're very close.
6288243 6289577 Homestretch, folks. Promise.
6289745 6291246 Quick, let's up the stakes.
6291412 6292748 If she steals the Time Ripper's energy...
6292914 6295375 she has the power to<br />shred the fabric of all realities...
6295542 6297168 until there is nothing left but The Void.
6297335 6298294 How do we shut it down?
6298712 6299630 I don't know.
6301382 6302466 How about now?
6302633 6303967 The mask is really intimidating, huh?
6304134 6306136 It's like Batman,<br />except he can move his neck.
6306303 6307721 Okay, look, look, look.
6309181 6311558 The Ripper is fed from<br />a secure chamber below ground.
6311725 6315854 It is powered by twin matter and anti-matter<br />feeds converging inside the device.
6316022 6317148 <i>Now, Cassandra Nova...</i>
6317314 6319483 <i>is redirecting the Ripper's power<br />to eliminate all timelines...</i>
6319650 6320651 starting with this one.
6320818 6322153 Theoretically, you could stop her...
6322319 6324155 by short-circuiting the feeds<br />in the chamber below.
6324321 6326699 One of you were to create a<br />circuit between the two feeds...
6326866 6330077 then the released power<br />would destroy the machine.
6330244 6332038 - But, well, but...<br />- Come on, man.
6332204 6334206 If you're not gonna swallow, spit it out.
6334373 6337419 Whoever formed the bridge<br />would be annihilated.
6337585 6339211 - I could live with that.<br />- Yeah, I could live with that, too, actually.
6339379 6341088 You know, we survive anything.<br />We're like cockroaches.
6341256 6342173 Not this time.
6342340 6345009 This is matter and anti-matter.
6345177 6347095 They do not play nicely with each other.
6347262 6350015 When they mix in your body<br />you will be atomized.
6350598 6352600 Trust the laws of physics<br />if you don't trust me.
6352767 6354811 Even if you lived long enough to<br />make the circuit...
6354978 6357522 you will die down there.
6382881 6384217 Hold off. Hold.
6384383 6385884 You heard that asshole upstairs.
6386052 6390098 Even if we pull this off,<br />we're dead. Permanently.
6390723 6391765 That's why it's got to be me.
6391933 6392766 What?
6396687 6397521 Look, man...
6398773 6400524 you didn't ask for any of this.
6400984 6402110 You were right.
6402443 6403361 I lied.
6404320 6406030 I lied right to your face...
6406197 6408074 just to get you to help me. And you did.
6408992 6410452 You didn't lie.
6412454 6413830 You made an educated wish.
6416916 6417751 Come on.
6419169 6420920 You got a whole world to go back to.
6422589 6423423 I got nothin'.
6425759 6426593 I got nothin'.
6431849 6432682 Give me this.
6439857 6441066 Hey.
6445571 6447407 I waited a long time for this team up.
6449700 6450660 You know something?
6452703 6454205 You were the best Wolverine.
6463089 6464883 Say hi to your friends for me.
6476978 6478063 No!
6478229 6479189 Open the door!
6479355 6481983 I can't hear you over all the<br />noble sacrifice.
6482150 6483276 Why are you fucking doing this?
6483444 6486572 Because I'm Marvel Jesus.
6488282 6489283 Or Spock.
6490534 6491535 Hard to say.
6496165 6496999 Wade!
6497749 6499710 You fucking idiot!
6504882 6506008 Sorry, I'm just stalling.
6506175 6508469 I think I'm nervous about dying.
6509303 6510429 This should be me.
6511138 6512807 Say hi to my friends for me, peanut.
6512974 6513975 Wade!
6514141 6516185 You want to be an annoying prick,<br />do it this side!
6516352 6518396 You're gonna die in there,<br />you dumb fuck!
6525403 6527072 Hey! You don't need to do this.
6527489 6529116 I'm not doing it 'cause I need it.
6530158 6532160 I'm doing it because they do.
6543130 6544381 No!
6573744 6575246 He's not gonna make it.
6583963 6585048 It's over.
6652576 6653910 <i>The Wolverine.</i>
6654995 6656788 <i>He's a hero in my world.</i>
6659082 6661585 <i>Whoever you think I am,<br />you got the wrong guy.</i>
6663128 6664880 <i>You were always the wrong guy...</i>
6666423 6668049 <i>till you weren't.</i>
6670094 6671595 <i>Wade.</i>
6673514 6678102 <i>Wade. You can finally, finally, matter.</i>
6694160 6695161 Vanessa.
6697622 6699457 <i>I wanna see Vanessa.</i>
6705755 6709968 For the first time in my life,<br />I am proud to wear this suit.
6711178 6712845 <i>It means I'm an X-Man.</i>
6715348 6716934 I am the X-Man.
6761020 6762564 Paradox.
6764398 6765567 You've been busy.
6765984 6767026 Well, somebody had to be.
6767193 6769153 We had some<br />strange readings from this location.
6769321 6772115 You wouldn't know anything about an<br />unsanctioned Time Ripper, would you?
6773157 6776286 No. No. I wouldn't know anything about an<br />unsanctioned Time Ripper.
6776453 6777954 Maybe you should ask Cassandra Nova.
6778122 6779038 Because I was assured...
6779206 6781708 that she was safely held in The Void.<br />But no...
6781875 6783919 she was here.<br />And she fondled my brain.
6784086 6785004 How did you let this happen?
6785170 6786046 You weren't involved at all?
6786213 6788715 In stopping her, yes!<br />Yes. I was.
6788883 6790425 But, not nearly enough.
6790592 6792803 Not as much as the men<br />who went down there after her.
6793470 6794554 My men.
6795305 6796306 My friends.
6797725 6798684 I warned them.
6798851 6802021 That they would be completely obliterated<br />if they went. But they went anyway. Like...
6803814 6804899 Like heroes.
6807026 6808694 Because that's who they were.
6811572 6812990 They just did what they had to do.
6814409 6815993 With no concern for their own safety.
6819247 6825837 The fact that we are all still standing here<br />is a testament to their heroism.
6829549 6831927 Anyway, there's nothing you or I can do<br />to bring them back now.
6833762 6835764 He has risen, baby girl.
6835931 6836723 Fuck!
6856243 6857453 Found your new Anchor Being.
6857954 6859914 And we're doing just fine, you piece of shit.
6860331 6861415 Mm. Mm-hmm.
6861791 6863250 Fine indeed.
6863417 6867421 All right. Put your greasy tits away,<br />you preening slut.
6868297 6869674 I don't understand.
6869841 6871008 How are you two still alive?
6871175 6873260 You were right.<br />One of us would have been killed.
6873428 6876389 But you put<br />a Deadpool and a Wolverine together...
6876556 6878641 make 'em hold hands<br />while listening to Madonna...
6878808 6880893 indestructible, motherfucker.
6881394 6883605 Let's get this Deadpool Variant<br />back to The Void.
6883771 6885607 - Wait, hold on. What?<br />- Nope. Actually...
6885773 6887317 This one's homegrown, like me.
6887484 6888568 He belongs here.
6889027 6889944 And you are?
6890112 6892655 Peterpool. But you can call me Peter.
6894282 6895325 And I hope that you do.
6901832 6903250 What the fuck is happening here?
6903416 6905085 You are under judgment...
6905252 6907129 for operating an unsanctioned Time Ripper.
6907295 6908380 - Take him.<br />- I was just doing what...
6908547 6909923 you don't have the guts to do.
6910716 6912926 Get your insolent hands off me!
6913093 6913927 Get off!
6915178 6916847 I'm grateful, gentlemen.
6917681 6918766 Let's hold the bows.
6918932 6921352 You led an<br />Omega-level mutant to this timeline.
6921519 6923104 - You're welcome.<br />- And you...
6923271 6925148 - shouldn't even be near this timeline.<br />- He's welcome.
6925439 6928692 And you look damn good in that suit.
6928859 6929861 I'm so sorry.
6934365 6937994 I wanna show you something.<br />Something huge.
6938161 6940079 That's what Scoutmaster Kevin used to say.
6941706 6942707 Do you see that?
6943457 6945209 Your universe is regenerating.
6946127 6947462 Whatever you did here...
6947879 6949756 you not only saved your world.
6950299 6952676 You spared your timeline from extinction.
6954511 6955595 I'd rest up.
6955970 6958348 I have a feeling your work<br />is only just getting started.
6958515 6960059 Till you're 90.
6960225 6961060 Wait!
6962519 6965230 We couldn't have made it out of The Void<br />without some help...
6966065 6969944 from some people that the world<br />kind of forgot.
6970444 6973823 Is there any way that you could maybe find<br />a way to bring them home?
6975908 6976992 I'll see what I can do.
6977743 6979620 And I promised my friend here...
6980037 6983583 that the TVA could undo some<br />pretty awful shit in his timeline.
6983749 6984709 What would you say to that?
6985042 6986085 Change the past?
6986711 6988671 Well, he did help me save the world.
6989004 6991341 And his past made him the man who did it.
6992425 6994677 There's nothing to fix, Mr. Wilson.
6996137 6997180 Logan.
7000683 7001476 Shawarma?
7001642 7002477 - I could eat.<br />- Yeah.
7012320 7014615 You know, the Avengers discovered shawarma.
7015616 7017242 They'd be lucky to have you.
7024625 7026627 - Oh.<br />- Oh, come on.
7026793 7027836 Fuck off!
7029004 7033717 Come here, my little cunchkin.<br />Yes, it's you. You're a survivor.
7035136 7036929 Oh, all is right in the world.
7038222 7039223 Yes, it is.
7041017 7042184 So what are you gonna do next?
7043811 7045813 I'll figure it out. I always do.
7046689 7047523 All right.
7048858 7050109 So I'll probably see you around?
7055156 7055990 Probably not.
7059494 7060328 See you, bub.
7070088 7071089 Logan.
7077679 7079347 Al. I'm back.
7079932 7081183 About damn time.
7081558 7082392 You holdin'?
7082559 7084311 I'm all outta devil's dandruff...
7084477 7087189 - and I'm shaking like an angry vibrator.<br />- Thank you, Al.
7087355 7088231 We have company.
7089107 7090609 Althea, this is...
7091360 7092403 This is Logan.
7092570 7093612 Nice to meet you, Logan.
7093779 7094613 Nice to meet you, too.
7094780 7098326 And this little ancient anal shit-knot is<br />Mary Puppins.
7098492 7100786 Or as I like to call her, Dogpool.
7100953 7102621 You want to treat yourself<br />to a little stroke?
7104290 7107335 - Get the tongue. There it is.<br />- Oh, my God! Motherfucker!
7107501 7111214 Right? It's like an armadillo<br />fucked a gremlin, angrily...
7111380 7112673 in a bed of gonorrhea...
7112841 7115218 - Wow.<br />- ...and didn't stop till the sun came up.
7116510 7118096 <i>Everyone wants to matter.</i>
7119013 7121641 <i>Turns out that<br />you don't need to be Marvel Jesus to do it.</i>
7122476 7124728 <i>You just need to<br />open your eyes and look around.</i>
7125437 7126438 <i>And if you're lucky...</i>
7127439 7128857 <i>you'll find a few friends.</i>
7129316 7130442 <i>Old friends...</i>
7131443 7133152 <i>and some new ones too.</i>
7137866 7139826 Give me the fucking dog. Talk to the girl.
7150295 7151421 Well, hi.
7151588 7152422 Hi.
7155259 7156260 You've been busy.
7159346 7160848 I did it for you.
7162892 7165185 And even if you don't want me,<br />I did it for you.
7174612 7175613 <i>It turns out...</i>
7176322 7177698 <i>I am the world-saving type.</i>
7178658 7180660 <i>Just look around this table<br />if you want proof.</i>
7181661 7182620 <i>And the best part?</i>
7183579 7185331 <i>Sometimes the people we save...</i>
7186374 7188543 <i>well, they save us right back.</i>
7228042 7230169 <i>You're not the only one with gifts.</i>
7230336 7231504 What is this place?
7260533 7261368 Nice suit.
7261534 7262410 Zip it, Stan Lee.
7271337 7273881 {\an8}I really like the,<br />the art in the Deadpool comics.
7274047 7276300 <i>You know, I just always felt a<br />kind of a kinship to him.</i>
7276467 7279178 And I just thought,<br />I'd like to play that guy someday.
7307999 7310502 I was there for three weeks<br />before I shot a single thing.
7310919 7312462 {\an8}At our first day of shooting...
7313004 7314506 <i>I was so nervous, man.</i>
7315089 7317176 Everyone was sort of going,<br />"Who's this guy?"
7317342 7319178 <i>You know, there was a lot of that and...</i>
7319344 7322806 you know, "Is he gonna deliver or not?"<br />You can feel all that kind of pressure.
7324141 7327394 It's always the suit's fault.<br />Never the actor.
7336195 7337572 - This is...<br />- The only way.
7346997 7348916 So this is what it feels like.
7351461 7353088 And there's the lights.
7353254 7354505 For medical research.
7355131 7357050 - Bye-bye, video.<br />- Bye.
7611103 7614982 I'm tired of these absolutely vile rumors<br />that I got Johnny killed.
7616066 7617109 Let's look at the tape.
7618318 7619527 <i>In The Void...</i>
7619695 7621488 <i>you're either food for Alioth...</i>
7621655 7622781 or you work for her.
7625951 7626869 Go on, Johnny.
7627411 7628537 And I'll tell you who "her" is.
7629037 7629913 Cassandra Nova.
7630080 7632249 A megalomaniacal, psychotic asshole.
7632416 7636128 A finger licking dead-inside pixie slab of<br />third rate dime-store nut-milk.
7636295 7637838 - And I'll tell you what she can do.<br />- I'm listening.
7638005 7641550 She can lick my goddamn cinnamon ring clean<br />and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.
7641717 7643927 In fact, I don't give a shit if she removes<br />all my skin and...
7644095 7645972 pops me like some nightmarish blood balloon.
7646139 7649100 If the last thing I do in this godforsaken<br />cum-gutter existence...
7649267 7652020 is light that fuck-box on fire,<br />I still won't die happy.
7652186 7653938 Holy shit, girl. You crazy.
7654105 7655732 That's right, Wade.<br />I won't be happy until...
7655899 7659653 I've urinated on her freshly barbecued corpse<br />and husk-fucked the charred remains...
7659819 7661571 while gargling Juggernaut's juggernuts.
7661738 7663114 - Wow!<br />- And you can quote me.
7663281 7664115 'Kay.
7664866 7666159 Got you, fuckface.
