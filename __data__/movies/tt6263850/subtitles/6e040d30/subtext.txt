1396537 1397737 that when they die,
1397771 1401107 their whole world slowly<br />withers out of existence.
1401141 1403977 You've just won the lottery<br />because I didn't die.
1404010 1405846 It was just a little midlife<br />crisis. I'm better now.
1405880 1408249 Oh, no, no, no. [laughing]
1410417 1412053 [Deadpool laughs along]
1412086 1414889 - Oh, my God.<br />- Oh, I love to laugh.
1414922 1417625 Can you imagine<br />if you were the Anchor Being?
1417658 1419759 - [Deadpool, dully] Yeah.<br />- [laughs] Oh!
1419793 1422330 - Yeah.<br />- No, it isn't you, Mr. Wilson.
1422996 1424464 Your Anchor Being died
1424498 1427734 in an act<br />of self-sacrifice so epic
1427767 1430137 that it sent shivers<br />down the Timeline.
1430171 1433240 I am referring, of course, to...
1434574 1438345 Logan. The Wolverine.
1441781 1444251 [weakly] <i>Don't be<br />what they made you.</i>

1458565 1459766 [Deadpool] Logan.
1460500 1461502 Of course.
1462168 1463169 Logan.
1464803 1465873 [Deadpool groans]
1465906 1467441 [yelling] Logan?
1467475 1469443 The guy with forks for hands?
1469477 1472046 - That Wolverine?<br />- [device beeps]
1472079 1473880 Yeah, I got it.<br />You can turn your
1473914 1476217 retro graphics of death<br />off now. Make it stop.
1476250 1477752 We're not doing it,<br />Mr. Wilson.
1477784 1479020 We certainly can't stop it.
1481088 1482122 [Deadpool]<br />How long have we got?
1482155 1484824 In most cases,<br />couple thousand years.
1484858 1486127 - Well, sweet.<br />- Well, most cases
1486160 1488596 aren't fast enough.<br />Not for me.
1488629 1489730 [Deadpool]<br />What does that mean?
1489764 1491931 It means that I have been tasked
1491965 1494401 with overseeing<br />the end of your universe.
1494434 1495368 And regardless of what
1495402 1497305 the pencil pushers upstairs<br />would prefer,
1497338 1498572 I will not
1498605 1502142 waste my life watching it die<br />slowly of natural causes.
1502175 1504311 We used to just prune<br />these things. Simple.
1504344 1506314 Elegant. Efficient.<br />But I'm told the TVA
1506347 1508849 doesn't like to do that<br />anymore. Well, I do.
1508883 1510685 And no matter what<br />my so-called superiors say,
1510718 1513321 the multiverse does not<br />need a babysitter.
1513354 1515021 We need a mercy killer.
1515056 1516757 And in this instance,
1516791 1520061 I am the mercy killer. Ha!
1521361 1522362 [chuckles]
1523430 1524331 [device beeps]
1524364 1526232 [Deadpool] What in<br />the MacGuffin is that?
1526266 1528602 [Mr. Paradox] That's<br />a Time Ripper, Mr. Wilson.
1528636 1530270 An accelerant.
1530303 1533006 Once completed,<br />it will allow me to destroy
1533039 1535075 the spacetime matrix<br />of your universe.
1535108 1537411 You see, I don't want<br />to work for the TVA.
1537445 1539313 I want to be the TVA.
1539347 1542083 And the first step involves<br />showing this organization
1542116 1543984 how much more efficient<br />it can become.
1544018 1545852 To wit, I will be<br />giving your universe
1545885 1548421 a swift and compassionate end.
1548455 1550057 And don't worry, your friends<br />won't feel a thing.
1550091 1552859 It'll be over just like this.<br />"Oh, what's that?" [groans]
1553461 1554527 Trust me.
1567107 1569542 You're gonna Old Yeller<br />my fucking universe?

1573246 1575316 Look, Mr. Wilson,<br />you have two choices.
1575349 1576851 You can either rejoin<br />your loved ones
1576883 1578753 and collectively cease<br />to exist in,
1578786 1581822 I'd say, 72 hours. Or...
1581856 1584391 you join the Sacred Timeline.
1584424 1586828 And you end your days<br />of insignificance
1586861 1589096 and mediocrity.
1589130 1590698 Wade.
1590731 1592600 Wade, you can finally,

1608850 1610785 I know.
1610819 1612987 And you know I'm...<br />I'm nothing if not

1616790 1617991 Yep, yep.

1954594 1956830 One Anchor Being<br />coming right up!
1956864 1959133 On your left, baby girl.
1959166 1960266 This Logan has the same
1960299 1962535 he-can-do-anything-<br />even-musicals look.
1962568 1964637 And bonus, he's actually<br />wearing a costume
1964670 1965906 like he's not embarrassed to be
1965939 1967306 in a superhero movie for once.
1967340 1968976 I don't understand.
1969009 1970210 You said my universe is dying
1970244 1972678 because this sack of nuts<br />got himself killed.
1972712 1975348 - Well, problem solved.<br />- My God.
1975381 1979786 You actually think you can<br />replace an Anchor Being
1979820 1981788 with this?
1981823 1984390 I wouldn't have accepted<br />any other Wolverine, BT dubs.
1984423 1986424 But you have outdone yourself
1986458 1988662 and brought me<br />the worst Wolverine!
1988695 1989930 What do you mean, the worst one?
1989963 1991431 Mr. Wilson.
1991464 1995434 This Wolverine let down<br />his entire world.
1995468 1997838 He's the stuff of legend,<br />but not in a good way.
1997871 1999107 And what he did,
1999140 2000506 well,
2000540 2002842 some things are just<br />beyond forgiveness.
2005145 2006478 Okay.
2006511 2009415 How do I... How do I make<br />this right? I'll do anything.
2009448 2012417 I gave you<br />a chance at greatness.
2012451 2015054 Because my superiors<br />deemed you "special."
2015087 2016556 Clearly not special<br />in a good way.
2016589 2017624 Apparently you have some
2017658 2019827 important future purpose<br />to serve.
2019860 2020961 With Thor. He holds me.
2020994 2022795 But I did my duty.
2022830 2024865 I gave you the opportunity<br />to be somebody.
2024898 2026867 And instead of<br />accepting my offering
2026900 2029368 with humility and gratitude,<br />you broke my nose.
2029402 2030436 [sighs] It looks great.
2030469 2032405 And you decimated<br />dozens of my men
2032438 2034041 with the exhumed corpse<br />of a hero.
2034074 2036409 Dishonoring not only<br />his remains but his memory.
2036442 2037777 What are you, the Internet?
2037811 2040047 Your world is dying!
2040080 2041447 Thank you very much.

2046551 2047619 is to make it quick.

2052059 2053659 I'm about to lose everything<br />that I've ever cared about

2056897 2057831 finally dies,
2057864 2060467 and he's standing<br />right behind me, isn't he?
2060499 2062468 Welcome to the MCU, by the way.
2062501 2064670 You're joining at a bit<br />of a low point.
2064704 2066738 As for you,<br />I wanna talk to your boss.
2066771 2068175 I want you to get him<br />on the phone

2882287 2883990 but there's<br />another British villain
2884023 2885124 who's gonna destroy my universe,
2885158 2886291 and I'm gonna stop him.
2886324 2887828 Oh, honey,<br />you don't really strike me
2887861 2889494 as the world-saving type.
2890429 2891864 [thunder rumbling in distance]
2891898 2893732 Did I hit a nerve?
2893765 2895467 [Deadpool] I didn't want it<br />to come to this.
2896101 2897136 Either you help us
2897170 2898503 or my friend here is gonna sing
2898537 2900338 the entire second act<br />of <i>Music Man</i>
2900372 2901606 with zero warm-up.
2902307 2903575 Where'd you get the chair?
2903608 2904642 [Cassandra Nova]<br />Well, once in a while,
2904675 2906712 I do get a Charles through here.
2906745 2908147 Never mine, though.
2908181 2911349 No. He didn't care to find me.
2911383 2914954 [Deadpool groans] Gen Z<br />and their trauma-bragging!
2914987 2917924 Can't you just stuff it down,<br />turn it into accomplishment
2917957 2919558 or cancer like the rest of us?
2919591 2921426 But I'm not like<br />the rest of you.
2921460 2923395 Except maybe the Wolverine.
2923428 2926065 Now, we could be<br />truly terrifying together.
2926099 2927399 You're that scary, huh?
2927432 2929736 The TVA certainly thought so.
2929769 2932404 They sent me here<br />before I could walk.
2932437 2933906 And you know,<br />it's the best thing
2933940 2935707 that ever happened to me.
2935741 2936608 I love it here.
2936641 2937977 [Deadpool] You live<br />in a garbage dump.
2938010 2941379 I think we both know who lives<br />in the garbage dump.
2941413 2943248 The Void is a paradise.
2943281 2947385 I can wield my power here<br />without shame.
2947419 2949387 Unfortunately I had<br />no Charles Xavier
2949421 2951389 to teach me temperance.
2951423 2953391 What about your Charles?
2953425 2954726 Did he protect you?
2955359 2957529 Did he make you feel safe?
2957562 2959499 We're mutants.<br />We're never safe.
2959532 2961934 - [roars]<br />- [Cassandra whoops]
2962268 2963468 [chuckles]
2963836 2964904 [whoops]
2967605 2968640 [Deadpool] Whoa, whoa,<br />whoa, whoa, whoa!
2968673 2970442 I don't...<br />I don't want the smoke.
2970475 2971643 I don't have any beef with you.
2971676 2973278 I just want to save my friends.
2973311 2974578 I just... I want to go home.
2974612 2976447 Well, the thing is,<br />I could get you home.
2976480 2978251 - Good.<br />- But I don't want to.
2978283 2980553 [Deadpool] Not good.<br />[groaning]
2982955 2985490 What do you want, Wade Wilson?
2985524 2988026 [Deadpool straining] Your...<br />fingers are inside me,
2988060 2989295 but not in a good way.
2989328 2992297 My brother could enter<br />one's mind with a thought.
2992330 2994632 I have to get my hands dirty.
2994665 2996969 - [Deadpool groaning]<br />- [shushing]
2997702 2998972 I've got you.
3001306 3002707 [whispers] <i>I've got you...</i>
3005110 3006344 [Wade, muffled]<br /><i>What do you mean?</i>
3007979 3010817 I can't... I can't reach you.<br />You're not here.
3010850 3012517 I'm right here.
3012551 3015520 - No, you're not. I can't...<br />- I'm right here.
3015554 3017756 Then show me.<br />You got to do something.
3018991 3020425 Show you what?
3020458 3024328 Show me you care about<br />something bigger than you.
3024361 3028400 <i>Ever since they turned you<br />down, you took a knee.</i>
3029067 3031037 Baby, you never got back up.
3033206 3035074 I know you're<br />going through something.
3035107 3037977 Let me go through it with you.
3038010 3040412 - Your crazy matches my crazy.<br />- Your crazy matches my crazy.
3043515 3044917 Where'd you go?
3045416 3046886 [Wade] Oh, my God.
3048253 3049856 [♪ melancholy music playing]

3053358 3055793 <i>"I don't want to be with you."</i>
3055827 3057296 <i>Go ahead. Say it.<br />Say... Say, "I don't..."</i>
3057330 3058762 Say it.<br />You don't wanna be with me.
3058796 3060266 <i>Tell me that and I'll walk away.</i>
3060299 3061334 <i>Say, "I don't want you."</i>

3075747 3077582 What?
3077616 3080418 - You'll never fucking matter.<br />- Fucking matter.
3080452 3082788 [♪ melancholy music continues]
3086359 3088994 - [Vanessa] <i>You'll...</i><br />- [Cassandra] <i>You'll...</i>

3097136 3098470 [Deadpool]<br />She never said that.
3098503 3099603 - [Cassandra] No.<br />- [groans]
3099637 3101573 [in mocking tone]<br />But I bet she thought it.
3101606 3102641 [Deadpool splutters]
3102674 3105410 [Deadpool groans]<br />You are so mean!
3105443 3106577 My brain could taste<br />your fingers,
3106610 3108747 and they tasted like hate!
3108780 3111484 And where in God's name<br />is the intimacy coordinator?
3111517 3114321 You're so lost, Mr. Wilson.
3114353 3116755 And long before you came here.
3118157 3119191 This is Baby Knife.
3119225 3120491 She's gonna fuck you<br />in the face now.
3120524 3121793 If you want to kill me,
3121827 3123695 it's going to take<br />more than a little blade.
3123728 3125530 [Deadpool] How about six?
3125563 3129234 [laughs mockingly]<br />My boy's wicked strong.
3129267 3130903 That's my big boy.
3130936 3132405 Yes, you are.
3132437 3133705 [groans]
3134373 3135573 [laughs]
3138476 3140045 [Cassandra]<br />Well, this has been fun.

3205978 3206846 I talk now.
3206879 3208414 That's gonna be very hard<br />on the audience.
3208447 3211050 Shut the fuck up!
3211083 3212084 Let me fuckin' think.
3212118 3214186 Now we gotta get back<br />to Paradox, right?
3216122 3217722 Right?
3217756 3219959 <i>Je m'excuse.</i> Am I allowed<br />to speak now or...
3219992 3222260 Just nod, asshole.
3223963 3224964 Right.
3224997 3226531 Then we find the others<br />that poor kid, Johnny,
3226564 3227799 was talking about<br />before you got him killed!
3227833 3229634 [Deadpool] "Poor kid."<br />He's, like, 50!
3229667 3230701 Yeah, if there's<br />a chance they know
3230734 3232370 how to get out of here,<br />we find 'em.
3232404 3234373 And make those TVA fuckers<br />fix my shit
3234407 3235707 like you fucking promised!
3235740 3237209 [Deadpool] I smell quest.
3237243 3238743 [sniffing]
3240012 3241013 I smell food.
3244150 3247820 So what made you finally wear<br />an honest-to-God costume?
3249388 3251555 Mine's red<br />so they can't see me bleed.
3251588 3254427 But I could see how<br />yellow would be useful too.
3254460 3256095 Have you been checked for ADHD?
3256128 3257430 Mm-mm.
3257463 3259563 But I've had several STDs,
3259596 3261766 which were probably caused<br />by ADHD.
3261800 3262868 Fuck!
3263767 3265371 What are you looking for?
3265404 3266972 Oh. Thank fuck.
3268040 3269908 No, no, no, no, no.<br />That's rubbing alcohol.
3269941 3271444 You don't want to drink...<br />Oh, yeah.

3273279 3274312 [exhales]
3274345 3276215 - Good. Okay.<br />- [sighs]
3277249 3278350 What the fuck are those?
3278984 3279852 Oh.
3279885 3281821 Back in civilian life,<br />I wear a toupee,

3290028 3291596 Wanna talk about<br />what's haunting you,
3291629 3293865 or should we wait<br />for a third act flashback?
3293898 3296001 Ah... Go fuck yourself.
3299271 3300272 You know...
3301841 3304175 in my world, you're...<br />[clears throat]
3305411 3306611 You're well regarded.
3306644 3308280 Yeah, well, not in mine.
3309247 3311182 They don't like me much<br />in mine either.
3311216 3312617 You don't say.
3312650 3314718 I wanted to be something,<br />you know. I...
3315588 3317323 Shit, I wanted to be an Avenger.
3317356 3319756 - Fuck the Avengers.<br />- Yeah.
3319790 3322061 I didn't make the cut, though.<br />Same with the X-Men...
3323996 3325063 When my girlfriend left me,
3325096 3326665 - and I just...<br />- You had a girlfriend?
3327032 3328067 Yeah.
3328466 3329835 Vanessa.
3329869 3331402 When we met, she was a dancer.
3332571 3333770 We had a whole life.
3335006 3336609 It was good.
3336641 3338844 But, oh, boy, I just... Mwah.
3339911 3341712 Fucked that right up.
3342413 3343548 But you,
3343581 3344917 you were an X-Man.
3344950 3347019 Fuck that.<br />You were the X-Man. You...
3348753 3350089 The Wolverine.
3352390 3354025 He was a hero in my world.
3355792 3356996 Yeah, well...
3358163 3359298 he ain't shit in mine.
3364735 3367339 You said, "Logan was a hero."<br />What happened?
3368240 3369241 He died.
3369909 3371242 How?
3371276 3373878 Well, technically, you were<br />chest-fucked by a tree, but,
3373912 3375679 really, you just<br />ran out of batteries
3375712 3377950 - trying to save someone.<br />- Who?
3377983 3379852 The shitheels<br />that grew her in a lab
3379885 3381420 called her "X-23." But...
3382221 3383922 she was just a kid.
3383955 3387593 A younger, daintier,<br />somehow meaner version of you.
3387626 3389395 You died trying to save her.
3389428 3390896 It was beautiful.
3390930 3393899 Look, <i>mijo,</i><br />I know you're hurtin'.
3393933 3396334 My blind, elderly,<br />African-American roommate,
3396367 3399605 Blind Al, always says that<br />pain teaches us who we are.
3399638 3401307 Sometimes we need to listen<br />to that pain
3401340 3402374 instead of running from it.
3402408 3404042 - Holy shit.<br />- Yeah, she's wise.
3404075 3406678 No, no, no. That's her name?<br />You call her "Blind Al"?
3406710 3407913 Well, she's blind.

3582488 3583822 [Deadpool] I know. Listen.
3583856 3585356 - [Dogpool whimpers]<br />- Yes, child.

3587725 3589727 or if something<br />should happen to you,

3638976 3640044 - I took mine off.<br />- Drop it.

4067305 4068873 of my own inadequacies?
4068907 4070473 Look at you.

4073278 4076647 The name's Remy LeBeau,<br /><i>Le Diable Blanc.</i>
4076680 4078083 But you can call me the Gambit.

4084223 4085422 just really,<br />really want them to,
4085456 4086825 but it never quite worked out?
4087958 4089426 [speaks indistinctly]
4089460 4091897 You know, we never had<br />a Wolverine up in here.
4092563 4093564 But I can tell you now,
4093597 4095599 it's just a common courtesy<br />to ask
4095633 4097369 before you drink up<br />all of my liquor.

4111383 4112782 we came a long way<br />to find you three.

4157594 4159197 She's the one I told you about.
4163634 4165803 Hey, how did you all get stuck<br />in The Void?
4165837 4167439 There was a knock at the door.
4167471 4169506 - TVA sent me here.<br />- Me, too.
4169540 4170607 Well, maybe I was born here.
4170641 4171909 It's... It's hard<br />to know for sure.
4171942 4175512 TVA decided<br />our universe was dying.
4175546 4177648 And I never even got a chance<br />to fight for it.
4180318 4182485 [Elektra] People like us<br />don't go quietly.
4182518 4184723 TVA knows that,<br />so they took us out.
4184756 4187158 [smooches]<br />The answer is yes. I'm in.
4187192 4189127 - In what?<br />- [Deadpool] A team.
4189159 4191363 Me, you, you, and me.<br />All of us together.
4191396 4192795 Let's get the fuck<br />out of this place.
4192830 4194564 Don't listen to him.<br />He's a fucking liar!
4194598 4196401 [Deadpool]<br />It was an educated wish!
4196434 4198036 - Ha!<br />- [Deadpool] Look.
4199471 4201438 We've been inside<br />Cassandra's lair.
4201472 4203908 The only way out of The Void<br />is through her.
4203942 4205844 She can get us home.<br />She told us.
4205877 4208412 Wait a minute,<br />you've been inside?
4208445 4210180 - And you made it out alive?<br />- Bullshit.
4210214 4211982 - Nobody's ever done that.<br />- [Deadpool] We did.
4212016 4214617 Every time one of us<br />has gone up against her,
4214952 4215954 they die.
4215987 4218756 The Punisher, the Quicksilver,<br />the Daredevil.
4218789 4220458 [Deadpool] Daredevil?<br />I'm so sorry.
4220492 4221892 - It's fine.<br />- [Deadpool] Okay.
4223862 4227198 Even that sweet, baby angel,<br />Johnny Storm.
4227232 4228665 He up and gone missing like,
4228699 4230634 what, two days ago?
4230667 4232970 [Deadpool] Ugh. That's so sad.
4233003 4235739 Wherever this Johnny fella is,<br />I'm sure he's thriving.
4235773 4236908 [Wolverine chuckles]
4236941 4239177 Look, there's...<br />there's strength in numbers.
4239210 4240311 All right? Us...
4240345 4241677 plus, you guys.<br />We can put Cassandra
4241711 4243982 over our knee and force her<br />to let us out of The Void.
4244015 4245682 I know what it means<br />to feel self-doubt.
4245716 4247252 - I don't feel that at all.<br />- I'm good.

4249552 4251089 It's like you're holding up<br />a mirror to my soul.

4252489 4254224 to save your universes.
4254258 4256429 But you can avenge them.
4256461 4257761 It's what Johnny<br />would have wanted.
4257795 4260831 Wait. You knew Johnny?
4261632 4262866 [chuckles] Oh, yeah.
4262900 4264868 Dickhead here talked him<br />into a team-up,
4264902 4267505 and Johnny came down with<br />a little case of the deads.
4267539 4268840 [Deadpool] No, no, no.<br />We don't know that.
4268873 4271076 It was just a flesh wound.<br />He may have survived.
4271109 4273878 If he survived that,<br />he is prayin' for death.
4273912 4275547 [Deadpool] Thank you,<br />Doctor Wolverine!
4275579 4277748 - Spill it!<br />- What'd you do to Johnny, huh?
4277781 4278950 Talk or I'm gonna start dealin'.
4278983 4280651 [Deadpool] Okay. Okay.<br />Hey, hey, hey.
4281118 4281952 Look.
4281985 4284421 He ran his fat-ass mouth<br />about Cassandra.
4284455 4286223 Then she zip-zapped his skin,
4286256 4288393 leaving his organs to splash<br />crudely onto the ground
4288426 4291362 while the soil greedily drank<br />his blood. It was horrible.
4291396 4293163 He was like a brother to me.
4293197 4296333 Look, he died before he could<br />make a difference. But...
4296366 4297402 - [laughs]<br />- Look, maybe you couldn't
4297435 4298870 save your worlds, but...
4298903 4301638 but Jesus Christ,<br />you can save mine!
4301672 4304141 I don't give a shit<br />about your world, but
4304174 4307113 if these two made it out of<br />there alive, maybe together,
4307145 4309047 we can get back in<br />and take her down.
4309080 4312050 Where I come from,<br />we call that suicide, <i>Chere.</i>
4312083 4314052 [Deadpool] If we can block<br />her psychic powers,
4314085 4315953 we can get a leg up.<br />I know it.
4315986 4318022 Now, I know Magneto's dead.
4318056 4320657 But I'd venture to guess<br />that his helmet is lying
4320691 4322726 - around here somewhere...<br />- Cassandra melted the helmet.
4322759 4323927 - [Deadpool] Fuck!<br />- After she killed him.
4323961 4325929 - [Deadpool] Fuck!<br />- She don't play.
4325963 4327397 She knows that helmet<br />was the only way
4327431 4329066 to protect anyone<br />from her powers.
4329100 4330968 The only other helmet that<br />strong is Juggernaut's,
4331002 4332237 but he works for Cassandra.
4332270 4333769 [Deadpool] Juggernaut's<br />helmet. That's it.
4333803 4335472 Yeah, and we done be knowing<br />that lid ain't comin' off
4335506 4336907 without that dome<br />gonna come off wit'it.
4336940 4338209 [Deadpool] I'm so sorry,<br />beautiful.

4345916 4348887 I'm sick of this shit.<br />I'm sick of hiding.

4443281 4444949 You might not know it,<br />but apparently,
4444983 4446383 I'm the worst Logan.
4448218 4450121 I got to have a life<br />because of you.
4453024 4454758 I got to grow up because of you.
4456759 4458328 A lot of kids did.

4465636 4467704 That suit says different.
4467738 4469873 - Yeah. Do you like it?<br />- Mm.
4471743 4473443 Scott used to beg me to wear it.

4480384 4482420 All of them.
4482453 4486190 They wanted me to be part<br />of the team, but I wouldn't.

4491362 4494131 I couldn't have 'em thinkin'<br />I wanted to be there.
4499802 4501839 And then one day,<br />while I was off on my own,
4501873 4503140 the humans came...
4503708 4505143 and went mutant hunting.

5203506 5204639 - Fuck!<br />- [Cassandra] I promise...
5204673 5206342 I will kill you first thing.
5206376 5208245 [Deadpool] Oh!<br />Why are you like this?

5219789 5222091 And that means a lot of<br />things, but most of all...
5223494 5224793 it means I'm an X-Man.

5229500 5230900 As much as I want<br />to fucking kill you,

5271007 5272008 Hmm.
5273377 5274643 Must be nice.

5282651 5284054 if he knew where you were,
5284087 5286355 he would've torn a hole<br />in the fucking universe
5286389 5287622 to bring you home.
5291294 5292362 This is my home.
5293430 5295832 Well, then at least<br />let us save his.

5303140 5306242 An amateur magician rolled<br />through here a while back.
5307176 5309079 I killed him, of course.
5309113 5311714 Wore his skin around<br />for four days.

6767268 6769137 We had some strange readings<br />from this location.
