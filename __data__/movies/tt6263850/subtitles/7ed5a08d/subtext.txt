1395340 1396539 that when they die,
1396573 1399906 their whole world slowly<br />withers out of existence.
1399940 1402773 You've just won the lottery<br />because I didn't die.
1402806 1404640 It was just a little midlife<br />crisis. I'm better now.
1404674 1407040 Oh, no, no, no. [laughing]
1409206 1410840 [Deadpool laughs along]
1410873 1413673 - Oh, my God.<br />- Oh, I love to laugh.
1413706 1416406 Can you imagine<br />if you were the Anchor Being?
1416439 1418538 - [Deadpool, dully] Yeah.<br />- [laughs] Oh!
1418572 1421106 - Yeah.<br />- No, it isn't you, Mr. Wilson.
1421772 1423238 Your Anchor Being died
1423272 1426505 in an act<br />of self-sacrifice so epic
1426538 1428905 that it sent shivers<br />down the Timeline.
1428939 1432005 I am referring, of course, to...
1433338 1437105 Logan. The Wolverine.

1460903 1461903 Logan.
1463535 1464604 [Deadpool groans]
1464637 1466170 [yelling] Logan?
1466204 1468170 The guy with forks for hands?
1468204 1470770 - That Wolverine?<br />- [device beeps]
1470803 1472603 Yeah, I got it.<br />You can turn your
1472636 1474937 retro graphics of death<br />off now. Make it stop.
1474970 1476470 We're not doing it,<br />Mr. Wilson.
1476502 1477737 We certainly can't stop it.
1479803 1480836 [Deadpool]<br />How long have we got?
1480869 1483535 In most cases,<br />couple thousand years.
1483569 1484837 - Well, sweet.<br />- Well, most cases
1484870 1487303 aren't fast enough.<br />Not for me.
1487336 1488436 [Deadpool]<br />What does that mean?
1488470 1490635 It means that I have been tasked
1490669 1493102 with overseeing<br />the end of your universe.
1493135 1494068 And regardless of what
1494102 1496003 the pencil pushers upstairs<br />would prefer,
1496036 1497269 I will not
1497302 1500835 waste my life watching it die<br />slowly of natural causes.
1500868 1503002 We used to just prune<br />these things. Simple.
1503035 1505003 Elegant. Efficient.<br />But I'm told the TVA
1505036 1507535 doesn't like to do that<br />anymore. Well, I do.
1507569 1509369 And no matter what<br />my so-called superiors say,
1509402 1512002 the multiverse does not<br />need a babysitter.
1512035 1513701 We need a mercy killer.
1513735 1515435 And in this instance,
1515469 1518735 I am the mercy killer. Ha!
1520034 1521034 [chuckles]
1522101 1523001 [device beeps]
1523034 1524900 [Deadpool] What in<br />the MacGuffin is that?
1524934 1527267 [Mr. Paradox] That's<br />a Time Ripper, Mr. Wilson.
1527301 1528934 An accelerant.
1528967 1531667 Once completed,<br />it will allow me to destroy
1531700 1533734 the spacetime matrix<br />of your universe.
1533767 1536067 You see, I don't want<br />to work for the TVA.
1536101 1537967 I want to be the TVA.
1538001 1540734 And the first step involves<br />showing this organization
1540767 1542633 how much more efficient<br />it can become.
1542667 1544499 To wit, I will be<br />giving your universe
1544532 1547066 a swift and compassionate end.
1547100 1548700 And don't worry, your friends<br />won't feel a thing.
1548734 1551499 It'll be over just like this.<br />"Oh, what's that?" [groans]

1571865 1573932 Look, Mr. Wilson,<br />you have two choices.
1573965 1575466 You can either rejoin<br />your loved ones
1575498 1577366 and collectively cease<br />to exist in,
1577399 1580432 I'd say, 72 hours. Or...
1580466 1582998 you join the Sacred Timeline.
1583031 1585432 And you end your days<br />of insignificance
1585465 1587698 and mediocrity.

1589331 1591198 Wade, you can finally,

1960780 1962846 And bonus, he's actually<br />wearing a costume

1973579 1977980 You actually think you can<br />replace an Anchor Being

1980014 1982579 I wouldn't have accepted<br />any other Wolverine, BT dubs.

1984645 1986846 and brought me<br />the worst Wolverine!

1996046 1997280 And what he did,
1997313 1998678 well,
1998712 2001012 some things are just<br />beyond forgiveness.
2003312 2004644 Okay.
2004677 2007578 How do I... How do I make<br />this right? I'll do anything.
2007611 2010577 I gave you<br />a chance at greatness.
2010610 2013211 Because my superiors<br />deemed you "special."
2013244 2014711 Clearly not special<br />in a good way.
2014744 2015778 Apparently you have some
2015812 2017979 important future purpose<br />to serve.
2018012 2019112 With Thor. He holds me.
2019145 2020944 But I did my duty.
2020979 2023011 I gave you the opportunity<br />to be somebody.
2023044 2025011 And instead of<br />accepting my offering
2025044 2027510 with humility and gratitude,<br />you broke my nose.
2027544 2028577 [sighs] It looks great.
2028610 2030544 And you decimated<br />dozens of my men
2030577 2032178 with the exhumed corpse<br />of a hero.
2032211 2034543 Dishonoring not only<br />his remains but his memory.
2034576 2035910 What are you, the Internet?
2035944 2038178 Your world is dying!
2038211 2039576 Thank you very much.

2879537 2881238 but there's<br />another British villain
2881271 2882371 who's gonna destroy my universe,
2882405 2883537 and I'm gonna stop him.
2883570 2885072 Oh, honey,<br />you don't really strike me
2885105 2886737 as the world-saving type.
2887671 2889104 [thunder rumbling in distance]
2889138 2890970 Did I hit a nerve?
2891003 2892703 [Deadpool] I didn't want it<br />to come to this.
2893337 2894371 Either you help us
2894405 2895736 or my friend here is gonna sing
2895770 2897569 the entire second act<br />of <i>Music Man</i>
2897603 2898836 with zero warm-up.
2899536 2900803 Where'd you get the chair?
2900836 2901869 [Cassandra Nova]<br />Well, once in a while,
2901902 2903937 I do get a Charles through here.
2903970 2905370 Never mine, though.
2905404 2908569 No. He didn't care to find me.
2908603 2912170 [Deadpool groans] Gen Z<br />and their trauma-bragging!
2912203 2915137 Can't you just stuff it down,<br />turn it into accomplishment
2915170 2916769 or cancer like the rest of us?
2916802 2918635 But I'm not like<br />the rest of you.
2918669 2920602 Except maybe the Wolverine.
2920635 2923269 Now, we could be<br />truly terrifying together.
2923303 2924602 You're that scary, huh?
2924635 2926936 The TVA certainly thought so.
2926969 2929602 They sent me here<br />before I could walk.
2929635 2931102 And you know,<br />it's the best thing
2931136 2932901 that ever happened to me.
2932935 2933801 I love it here.
2933834 2935169 [Deadpool] You live<br />in a garbage dump.
2935202 2938567 I think we both know who lives<br />in the garbage dump.
2938601 2940434 The Void is a paradise.
2940467 2944567 I can wield my power here<br />without shame.
2944601 2946567 Unfortunately I had<br />no Charles Xavier
2946601 2948567 to teach me temperance.
2948601 2950567 What about your Charles?
2950601 2951900 Did he protect you?
2952533 2954700 Did he make you feel safe?
2954733 2956668 We're mutants.<br />We're never safe.
2956701 2959101 - [roars]<br />- [Cassandra whoops]
2959434 2960633 [chuckles]
2961001 2962068 [whoops]
2964766 2965800 [Deadpool] Whoa, whoa,<br />whoa, whoa, whoa!
2965833 2967600 I don't...<br />I don't want the smoke.
2967633 2968800 I don't have any beef with you.
2968833 2970433 I just want to save my friends.
2970466 2971732 I just... I want to go home.
2971766 2973599 Well, the thing is,<br />I could get you home.
2973632 2975401 - Good.<br />- But I don't want to.
2975433 2977700 [Deadpool] Not good.<br />[groaning]
2980100 2982632 What do you want, Wade Wilson?
2982666 2985166 [Deadpool straining] Your...<br />fingers are inside me,
2985199 2986433 but not in a good way.
2986466 2989432 My brother could enter<br />one's mind with a thought.
2989465 2991765 I have to get my hands dirty.
2991798 2994099 - [Deadpool groaning]<br />- [shushing]
2994831 2996100 I've got you.
2998432 2999831 [whispers] <i>I've got you...</i>
3002232 3003464 [Wade, muffled]<br /><i>What do you mean?</i>
3005098 3007933 I can't... I can't reach you.<br />You're not here.
3007966 3009631 I'm right here.
3009665 3012631 - No, you're not. I can't...<br />- I'm right here.
3012665 3014864 Then show me.<br />You got to do something.
3016098 3017531 Show you what?
3017564 3021430 Show me you care about<br />something bigger than you.
3021463 3025497 <i>Ever since they turned you<br />down, you took a knee.</i>
3026164 3028132 Baby, you never got back up.
3030298 3032164 I know you're<br />going through something.
3032197 3035064 Let me go through it with you.
3035097 3037497 - Your crazy matches my crazy.<br />- Your crazy matches my crazy.
3040597 3041997 Where'd you go?
3042496 3043964 [Wade] Oh, my God.

3074662 3077461 - You'll never fucking matter.<br />- Fucking matter.
3077495 3079828 [♪ melancholy music continues]

3095527 3096626 - [Cassandra] No.<br />- [groans]
3096660 3098594 [in mocking tone]<br />But I bet she thought it.
3098627 3099661 [Deadpool splutters]
3099694 3102427 [Deadpool groans]<br />You are so mean!
3102460 3103593 My brain could taste<br />your fingers,
3103626 3105760 and they tasted like hate!
3105793 3108494 And where in God's name<br />is the intimacy coordinator?
3108527 3111328 You're so lost, Mr. Wilson.
3111360 3113760 And long before you came here.
3115160 3116193 This is Baby Knife.
3116227 3117492 She's gonna fuck you<br />in the face now.
3117525 3118793 If you want to kill me,
3118827 3120693 it's going to take<br />more than a little blade.
3120726 3122526 [Deadpool] How about six?
3122559 3126226 [laughs mockingly]<br />My boy's wicked strong.
3126259 3127893 That's my big boy.
3127926 3129394 Yes, you are.

3205356 3207956 Shut the fuck up!
3207989 3208989 Let me fuckin' think.
3209023 3211089 Now we gotta get back<br />to Paradox, right?

3224722 3226521 [Deadpool] "Poor kid."<br />He's, like, 50!
3226554 3227587 Yeah, if there's<br />a chance they know
3227620 3229254 how to get out of here,<br />we find 'em.
3229288 3231255 And make those TVA fuckers<br />fix my shit

3232621 3234088 [Deadpool] I smell quest.
3234122 3235620 [sniffing]
3236888 3237888 I smell food.
3241022 3244688 So what made you finally wear<br />an honest-to-God costume?
3246254 3248419 Mine's red<br />so they can't see me bleed.
3248452 3251288 But I could see how<br />yellow would be useful too.
3251321 3252954 Have you been checked for ADHD?
3252987 3254288 Mm-mm.
3254321 3256419 But I've had several STDs,
3256452 3258619 which were probably caused<br />by ADHD.
3258653 3259720 Fuck!
3260618 3262221 What are you looking for?
3262254 3263820 Oh. Thank fuck.

3290718 3292819 Ah... Go fuck yourself.
3296085 3297085 You know...
3298652 3300984 in my world, you're...<br />[clears throat]
3302219 3303417 You're well regarded.
3303450 3305085 Yeah, well, not in mine.
3306051 3307984 They don't like me much<br />in mine either.
3308018 3309417 You don't say.
3309450 3311516 I wanted to be something,<br />you know. I...
3312385 3314118 Shit, I wanted to be an Avenger.
3314151 3316549 - Fuck the Avengers.<br />- Yeah.
3316583 3318851 I didn't make the cut, though.<br />Same with the X-Men...
3320784 3321850 When my girlfriend left me,
3321883 3323450 - and I just...<br />- You had a girlfriend?
3323817 3324851 Yeah.
3325250 3326617 Vanessa.
3326651 3328183 When we met, she was a dancer.
3329350 3330548 We had a whole life.
3331783 3333384 It was good.
3333416 3335617 But, oh, boy, I just... Mwah.
3336683 3338482 Fucked that right up.
3339182 3340316 But you,
3340349 3341683 you were an X-Man.
3341716 3343783 Fuck that.<br />You were the X-Man. You...
3345515 3346850 The Wolverine.
3349149 3350782 He was a hero in my world.
3352547 3353750 Yeah, well...
3354916 3356049 he ain't shit in mine.
3361481 3364082 You said, "Logan was a hero."<br />What happened?
3364982 3365982 He died.
3366649 3367981 How?
3368015 3370614 Well, technically, you were<br />chest-fucked by a tree, but,
3370648 3372413 really, you just<br />ran out of batteries
3372446 3374682 - trying to save someone.<br />- Who?
3374715 3376582 The shitheels<br />that grew her in a lab
3376615 3378148 called her "X-23." But...
3378948 3380648 she was just a kid.
3380681 3384315 A younger, daintier,<br />somehow meaner version of you.
3384348 3386115 You died trying to save her.
3386148 3387614 It was beautiful.

3390648 3393047 My blind, elderly,<br />African-American roommate,

3396347 3398014 Sometimes we need to listen<br />to that pain
3398047 3399080 instead of running from it.
3399114 3400747 - Holy shit.<br />- Yeah, she's wise.
3400780 3403380 No, no, no. That's her name?<br />You call her "Blind Al"?

3579006 3580339 [Deadpool] I know. Listen.
3580373 3581871 - [Dogpool whimpers]<br />- Yes, child.

3584238 3586237 or if something<br />should happen to you,

4080216 4081414 just really,<br />really want them to,

4083948 4085414 [speaks indistinctly]
4085448 4087882 You know, we never had<br />a Wolverine up in here.
4088548 4089548 But I can tell you now,
4089581 4091581 it's just a common courtesy<br />to ask
4091615 4093349 before you drink up<br />all of my liquor.

4159544 4161711 Hey, how did you all get stuck<br />in The Void?
4161745 4163345 There was a knock at the door.
4163377 4165410 - TVA sent me here.<br />- Me, too.
4165444 4166510 Well, maybe I was born here.
4166544 4167811 It's... It's hard<br />to know for sure.
4167844 4171410 TVA decided<br />our universe was dying.
4171444 4173544 And I never even got a chance<br />to fight for it.
4176211 4178376 [Elektra] People like us<br />don't go quietly.
4178409 4180611 TVA knows that,<br />so they took us out.
4180644 4183044 [smooches]<br />The answer is yes. I'm in.
4183078 4185011 - In what?<br />- [Deadpool] A team.
4185043 4187244 Me, you, you, and me.<br />All of us together.
4187277 4188675 Let's get the fuck<br />out of this place.
4188710 4190442 Don't listen to him.<br />He's a fucking liar!
4190476 4192277 [Deadpool]<br />It was an educated wish!
4192310 4193910 - Ha!<br />- [Deadpool] Look.
4195344 4197309 We've been inside<br />Cassandra's lair.
4197343 4199776 The only way out of The Void<br />is through her.
4199810 4201710 She can get us home.<br />She told us.
4201743 4204276 Wait a minute,<br />you've been inside?
4204309 4206042 - And you made it out alive?<br />- Bullshit.
4206076 4207842 - Nobody's ever done that.<br />- [Deadpool] We did.
4207876 4210474 Every time one of us<br />has gone up against her,
4210809 4211810 they die.
4211843 4214609 The Punisher, the Quicksilver,<br />the Daredevil.
4214642 4216309 [Deadpool] Daredevil?<br />I'm so sorry.
4216343 4217742 - It's fine.<br />- [Deadpool] Okay.
4219709 4223042 Even that sweet, baby angel,<br />Johnny Storm.
4223076 4224507 He up and gone missing like,
4224541 4226474 what, two days ago?
4226507 4228808 [Deadpool] Ugh. That's so sad.
4228841 4231574 Wherever this Johnny fella is,<br />I'm sure he's thriving.

4232775 4235008 Look, there's...<br />there's strength in numbers.
4235041 4236141 All right? Us...
4236175 4237506 plus, you guys.<br />We can put Cassandra
4237540 4239808 over our knee and force her<br />to let us out of The Void.
4239841 4241507 I know what it means<br />to feel self-doubt.
4241541 4243075 - I don't feel that at all.<br />- I'm good.

4245373 4246908 It's like you're holding up<br />a mirror to my soul.

4248307 4250040 to save your universes.
4250074 4252242 But you can avenge them.
4252274 4253573 It's what Johnny<br />would have wanted.
4253607 4256640 Wait. You knew Johnny?
4257440 4258673 [chuckles] Oh, yeah.
4258707 4260673 Dickhead here talked him<br />into a team-up,
4260707 4263307 and Johnny came down with<br />a little case of the deads.
4263341 4264640 [Deadpool] No, no, no.<br />We don't know that.
4264673 4266874 It was just a flesh wound.<br />He may have survived.
4266907 4269673 If he survived that,<br />he is prayin' for death.
4269707 4271340 [Deadpool] Thank you,<br />Doctor Wolverine!
4271372 4273539 - Spill it!<br />- What'd you do to Johnny, huh?

4274773 4276439 [Deadpool] Okay. Okay.<br />Hey, hey, hey.
4276906 4277739 Look.
4277772 4280205 He ran his fat-ass mouth<br />about Cassandra.
4280239 4282005 Then she zip-zapped his skin,
4282038 4284173 leaving his organs to splash<br />crudely onto the ground
4284206 4287139 while the soil greedily drank<br />his blood. It was horrible.
4287173 4288938 He was like a brother to me.
4288972 4292105 Look, he died before he could<br />make a difference. But...
4292138 4293173 - [laughs]<br />- Look, maybe you couldn't
4293206 4294639 save your worlds, but...
4294672 4297404 but Jesus Christ,<br />you can save mine!
4297438 4299905 I don't give a shit<br />about your world, but
4299938 4302873 if these two made it out of<br />there alive, maybe together,
4302905 4304805 we can get back in<br />and take her down.
4304838 4307805 Where I come from,<br />we call that suicide, <i>Chere.</i>
4307838 4309805 [Deadpool] If we can block<br />her psychic powers,
4309838 4311704 we can get a leg up.<br />I know it.
4311737 4313771 Now, I know Magneto's dead.
4313805 4316403 But I'd venture to guess<br />that his helmet is lying
4316437 4318470 - around here somewhere...<br />- Cassandra melted the helmet.
4318503 4319670 - [Deadpool] Fuck!<br />- After she killed him.
4319704 4321670 - [Deadpool] Fuck!<br />- She don't play.
4321704 4323136 She knows that helmet<br />was the only way
4323170 4324804 to protect anyone<br />from her powers.
4324837 4326704 The only other helmet that<br />strong is Juggernaut's,
4326737 4327971 but he works for Cassandra.
4328004 4329502 [Deadpool] Juggernaut's<br />helmet. That's it.
4329536 4331203 Yeah, and we done be knowing<br />that lid ain't comin' off

5278826 5281092 he would've torn a hole<br />in the fucking universe

6760456 6762323 We had some strange readings<br />from this location.
