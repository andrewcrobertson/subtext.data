35458 39500 <i>That logo music just gets you pumped.<br />Right?</i>
39667 42375 <i>I'm sorry. I just, I'm excited<br />to be here. It's been a while.</i>
42542 45375 <i>You know, for a long time,<br />I wasn't sure I'd ever be back.</i>
45542 46500 <i>Disney bought Fox...</i>
46667 49417 <i>there was a whole boring rights issue,<br />blabbity-blabbity-blah.</i>
49583 52333 <i>But then, it turned out, they wanted me.</i>
52500 54917 <i>The one guy<br />who shouldn't even have his own movie...</i>
55083 56667 <i>much less a franchise.</i>
57208 59333 <i>Marvel's so stupid.</i>
60083 62083 <i>Look, we know the title of this thing. So...</i>
62250 63583 <i>I know what you're wondering.</i>
63750 67583 <i>How are we gonna do this<br />without dishonoring Logan's memory?</i>
68208 69417 <i>And I'll tell you how.</i>
70542 71375 <i>We're not.</i>
73375 75375 <i>I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.</i>
75542 77792 <i>Wolverine is not dead.</i>
77958 80917 <i>Sure, it made for a perfect ending<br />to a very sad story.</i>
81125 84250 <i>But that's not how<br />regenerative healing factors work.</i>
84417 87792 <i>You think I wanna be out here<br />in beautiful downtown North Dakota...</i>
87958 90792 <i>digging up the one and only Wolverine?<br />No, thank you.</i>
91250 93583 <i>But the fate of my entire world is at stake.</i>
93750 98458 <i>He may not be living his best life,<br />but he sure as hell ain't dead.</i>
103958 104958 Bingo.
105750 106750 Yahtzee.
110042 112917 Yes, yes, yes.
116500 117500 Damn it!
118583 121208 Son of a bitch!
123000 124083 You...
126542 129792 Christ. Motherfucker!
129958 131500 My world is fuck...
132667 133958 That was weird.
134458 135833 I'm much calmer now.
137083 139917 Look, I'm not a man of science.
140083 142708 But you seem incredibly passed away.
146500 148042 But it's good to see ya.
148208 151125 I gotta be honest,<br />I've always wanted to ride with you, Log.
151292 156250 You and me getting into it.<br />Deadpool and Wolverine just fuckin' shit up.
156417 159583 Can you imagine the fun, the chaos...
159750 160708 the residuals?
161917 162958 "G'day, mate.
163125 164792 "There's nothing that'll<br />bring me back to life faster...
164958 167417 "than a big bag of Marvel cash."
169208 170250 Me too, Hugh.
171000 173208 But, no. No, no, no.
174792 179542 You had to get all noble and die for real.<br />Goddamn it!
181250 183333 I could really use your help right now.
194417 195250 Wait!
196417 198042 I'm warning you, I'm not alone.
198208 199667 Wade Winston Wilson...
200417 203125 you are under arrest<br />by the Time Variance Authority...
203292 205125 for too many crimes to list.
205292 206125 Come out...
206292 207625 and we'll extend you the courtesy...
207792 209875 - of taking you in one piece.<br />- Death by day-player.
210042 210958 Last chance.
211375 214167 Throw out your weapons<br />and come out peacefully.
214792 216625 I'm not gonna give you my weapons...
216792 218833 but I promise not to use them.
219875 222500 There are two hundred and six bones<br />in the human body.
222667 224833 Two hundred and seven<br />if I'm watching <i>Gossip Girl.</i>
225792 227750 Here we go. Maximum effort.
235083 237833 Okay, peanut.<br />Guess we're getting that team up after all.
307833 309667 Maradona from outside the box!
310125 312208 {\an8}Goal!
359833 361083 Come on, big fella.
400167 402583 I am soaking wet right now.
405875 407875 <i>To be clear, I'm not proud of any of this.</i>
408042 411917 <i>The wanton violence,<br />the whiff of necrophilia. It isn't who I am.</i>
412083 413417 <i>It isn't who I wanna be.</i>
413583 414833 <i>Who I wanna be?</i>
415000 416583 <i>Well, to help you understand that...</i>
416750 417792 <i>I've gotta take you back.</i>
417958 420542 <i>A little joyride I took<br />through space and time...</i>
420708 423250 <i>to the day that changed everything.</i>
435375 437000 {\an8}I can't believe I'm finally here.
437167 439708 {\an8}I've waited for this moment for so long.
441042 443167 Thank you, sir, for seeing me.
444250 446125 I firmly believe...
446292 447583 that my services could be of...
447750 450500 great use to your organization.<br />Now I know...
450667 452958 I was caught smashturbating<br />in the lobby of Stark Tower...
453125 454333 - but I can assure you that...<br />- Smashturbating?
454500 455750 I'm sorry, what, what was that?
455917 459125 No, I'm sorry.<br />That, that's when you get those toy...
459292 461958 Hulk hands, right? And then you just,<br />you look down, and you just...
463292 465875 you brace yourself,<br />and you ravage the midsection.
466042 467542 - Pinch the... Yeah. Okay.<br />- I get it. Okay, thank you.
467708 469583 - The picture's painted.<br />- You get the gist.
469750 471917 What exactly brings you here today?
472083 474792 Why am I... Wow. Okay.
474958 476833 I care.
477083 479542 I know I turn everything into a joke,<br />but I...
481625 484250 I care, and I, I wanna use that feeling...
485292 487167 for something important.
487583 488917 I, I wanna matter.
491833 493542 I need to show my girl that I matter.
494917 495917 And...
496625 498625 you know,<br />I feel like I'm wasting the good stuff here.
498792 500708 - Is the man not gonna be joining us?<br />- The man?
500875 503000 Yeah. I should save this if he's gonna...
503542 505417 As, as far as you're concerned right now,<br />I'm the man.
505583 506708 - No.<br />- The man is me.
507125 510083 I am the man in this circumstance.
510917 512875 He doesn't do this kind of thing anymore.
513042 513875 - Cameos?<br />- Meetings.
514042 515582 - Meetings.<br />- Entry-level meetings.
515750 516542 Entry-level?
516707 518542 Aren't you the chauffeur...
518707 520707 - maybe?<br />- I... Common misconception.
520875 523957 - Okay.<br />- I did begin my career as Mr. Stark's driver.
524125 525125 - Okay.<br />- Quickly pivoted to...
525292 526667 - Chauffeur.<br />- ...the Head of Security.
526833 528667 The Head of... Of course, yes, yes, yes.
528833 531708 And why I am vetting your résumé.
531875 533958 You seem to have left out<br />whether or not you had...
534125 535625 any experience as a member of a team.
535792 538000 Could you maybe<br />add a little bit of perspective there?
538167 540333 No, yes, of course. I was Special Forces...
540500 543000 - Okay.<br />- but I was... Mainly, I was team leader...
543167 544250 founder, really, of X-Force.
544417 546333 Sadly, they,<br />they all perished in action though.
546500 547792 How exactly did that happen?
547958 549833 Well, the police say gravity, but if...
550000 550833 Just between us...
551000 552583 - they didn't test well in the focus group.<br />- I see.
552750 554500 - Particularly Cable.<br />- X-Force.
554667 556542 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look,<br />I can see this isn't going well.
556708 558083 Please stop writing. Look, I, I...
558250 560083 I'm just... I wanna be an Avenger.
561833 563583 I wanna be an Avenger.
565500 566875 Why do you wanna be an Avenger?
567417 570375 Look around you. I mean, they're the,<br />they're the best of the best.
570542 572333 And, and what they do matters.
572500 574750 I need to be an Avenger.
575042 578625 Sir, my girl has kinda had it with my shtick,<br />and I, if I don't, you know...
578792 581417 turn things around<br />and do something with my gifts...
581583 583125 I don't think it's gonna<br />really work out for me...
583292 584542 and I wouldn't blame her.
585958 589958 Avengers are a very unique group<br />of superheroes...
590208 591333 that stand for something...
591500 594083 more than just fighting and wearing costumes.
594250 597167 I mean, people look up to us.<br />Kids look up to us.
597333 598542 - They...<br />- I'm sorry. "Us?"
598708 600458 I wasn't aware that you were an Avenger.
601250 602708 - Avengers-adjacent, technically.<br />- Oh, wow.
602875 605917 What's your superpower?<br />Is it parallel parking? I am so sorry.
606417 607667 That was cruel.
607833 609958 I lash out when I'm nervous.<br />Won't happen again.
610125 611417 - Let's cut to the chase.<br />- Please.
611583 612917 You just said moments ago...
613083 617000 that you wanted to be an Avenger<br />because you need it.
617500 618750 Yes, sir, I do.
618917 621750 But the Avengers don't do the job because<br />they need it.
621917 623833 They do the job because people need them.
625042 626458 Do you see the distinction?
628250 629708 Yes, sir.
630542 632083 Please, Mr. Hogan.
632250 635500 I don't wanna spend the rest of my life<br />like an annoying one-trick pony.
638375 639375 All right.
640417 642000 Oh, my God, you're standing.
642167 643500 Yeah, now's the time that we stand.
643667 644500 Damn it.
644667 646125 Now, the problem might be that you're...
646292 648542 reaching a little, little too high.
648708 651125 Aim for the middle, and you'll never miss.
651292 653458 Right? I think you got a good heart.<br />I believe what you're saying.
654375 657500 But not everybody's the world-saving type.<br />I'm not, and I'm happy.
658208 659917 Right? I found my place.
660750 662000 Find your place.
663208 664583 - All right? Get back out there.<br />- Mm-hmm.
665292 668167 - We'll keep an eye on you. Good luck.<br />- Okay.
671708 673625 Fetch the car. I wanna hit Shake Shack.
674083 675833 Rejection makes me hungy.
676667 678208 - Really? No?<br />- No, no. Please.
678375 680958 - Yeah, no, no, no. Okay, thank you.<br />- Oh, okay.
683167 686250 <i>You know what they say.<br />When one door closes...</i>
687583 688625 <i>your locker at work opens.</i>
698958 702000 Now let's go sell some certified<br />pre-owned vehicles, motherfu...
704458 707417 Technically, the,<br />the Carnival's not a minivan.
708667 709667 It's an MPV.
709833 711417 So how does the Kia compare to...
711583 712875 - the Honda Odyssey?<br />- The Odyssey?
713042 715583 That's a great question.<br />It doesn't fucking suck.
716250 718458 You know, you can answer<br />the question without swearing.
718625 720542 I'm sorry, Tammy, I don't, I don't have kids.
721250 722833 Not that I haven't dreamt of that...
723000 725042 but I don't have a lot of vaginal sex.
728542 729917 {\an8}You'll get 'em next time, pal.
730083 732542 And look,<br />you can always go back to superhero-ing.
732708 734583 I mean,<br />I know I'd like to see you back in the suit.
735292 737708 I don't keep it in my locker<br />so that I can wear it.
738125 740625 I keep it in my locker in case<br />we need to saddle up again.
740792 743667 Hey, hey, hey. What?<br />What is that doing in there?
744000 744833 I'm done.
746542 747542 I'm done.
748542 750542 And I'm fine with being done.
750708 752208 Look, is sales the best match?
752375 753208 Probably not.
753375 756750 Is this the life that<br />I always imagined for myself? Fuck no.
757708 760333 But this is the right fit for me,<br />Sugar Bear, it is.
760625 762042 Okay, Mr. Wilson.
762417 766167 I'm just saying, once a month,<br />we could go on a little mission.
766333 768833 We're human beings. We crave purpose.
769000 770667 After all, we're Deadpool.
770833 774792 Please stop saying that. We're not Deadpool.<br />I'm not even Deadpool anymore.
775750 778583 Well, if you're gonna have a midlife crisis,<br />go big.
778750 779750 A few years ago...
779917 782917 a friend of mine got his nipples pierced<br />with a titanium chain...
783083 786042 that goes down<br />and attaches to his Van Johnson.
790083 793208 Are, are you feeling grumplestiltskin<br />'cause it's your birthday?
795208 796042 What?
797042 797875 No.
799042 799875 No.
803500 805250 Surprise!
805542 807917 Hey, you guys are lucky I'm not armed.
808583 809750 Get in here.
809917 812167 If this were six years ago,<br />you'd all be dead.
812333 815125 So then, he gets out of the cab,<br />and you will not believe it.
815292 817625 - I turn around, and what do I find?<br />- AirPods.
817792 819083 - His AirPods. Come on.<br />- His AirPods!
819250 820167 Crazy story.
820333 822708 - Every time. Come on.<br />- Every single time.
824792 826208 Make any sales today?
826375 827750 You know I didn't.
827917 831042 Did you sell any dreamcatchers on Etsy<br />or whatever it is that you do?
831208 832667 Our rent's due in three days, Wade.
832833 834083 I can't keep carrying you.
834250 835875 Relax. I have the money.
836042 839458 I sold some old blood pressure medication<br />I found lying around.
839833 841208 You tryin' to kill me, motherfucker?
841375 843500 I'm not the one dousing everything in salt, motherfucker.
843667 845708 I pray every day that...
845875 847542 fire finds your body...
847708 849083 and finishes the job...
849250 851708 - God didn't have the nuts to do.<br />- That's hurtful.
851875 854708 If you could hear the look on my face,<br />you'd smell how sad I am.
854875 856000 You watched anything good?
856167 857750 <i>Great British Bake Off.</i>
857917 859208 Oh, goddamn.
859375 861708 That show stood between me and suicide<br />for ten years.
861875 864250 Those are my feelings<br />on abortion, religious freedom...
864417 866500 animal rights, privacy rights, vaccines...
866667 868875 free-market capitalism,<br />global climate change.
869042 871167 Yeah, duh-duh-duh.<br />No, no speaking lines, Buck.
871750 872708 Hi, Yukio.
872875 873792 Hi, Wade.
873958 875667 Nice fake o'clock shadow.
876625 879917 It's a summer balayage. From the French.
880083 883250 It's meant to mimic the<br />natural highlights of the sun.
883417 885125 - It's a toupée.<br />- It's a hair system.
885292 888542 - I love your hair system, Wade.<br />- Thank you.
888958 890542 Wanna do some cocaine?
890708 893667 Hey, cocaine is the one thing<br />that Feige said is off limits.
893833 896500 - What about Bolivian marching powder?<br />- They know all the slang terms.
896667 897625 They have a list.
897792 899458 - Even snowboarding?<br />- Even disco dust.
899625 901208 - White girl interrupted?<br />- Even Forrest Bump.
901375 903250 - Booger sugar?<br />- I wouldn't even try powdered gonuts.
903417 906875 - You wanna build a snowman?<br />- Yes. But I can't.
908417 909250 Pull here.
909917 910917 - Here?<br />- Yeah.
912292 913792 - What happened?<br />- That's the fun part.
915208 916333 Thanks for coming.
916500 917417 Yeah.
917583 918583 How's work?
918875 920083 Oh, I got a promotion.
921083 921958 No way.
922125 925333 Yeah. It's mind-numbing middle management,<br />but I'm happy.
925500 926542 That's great.
928500 929833 - You seeing anyone?<br />- How about you?
931500 932333 Yeah.
932833 935375 A guy from work. Dermot.
935542 936583 Dermot.
936750 938083 - He's kind.<br />- Good.
938250 939750 Likes to go hiking.
939917 941292 Hasn't gotten me shot yet.
941458 943583 Well, it's early days.
947708 949458 What about you? You seeing anyone?
950500 953833 No, no, I live in a one-bedroom apartment.<br />I share a bed with Blind Al.
955500 958750 - Okay. All right.<br />- All right.
960417 963667 <i>Happy birthday to you</i>
963833 965375 - Speech! Speech!<br />- Yes!
965542 967333 All right. Okay, okay, okay.
968292 969292 Birthdays.
969458 972125 Boy, every spin around the moon<br />is a new adventure indeed.
972292 974333 - Sun, dumbass.<br />- Okay, round-earther.
976000 977917 - Where was I?<br />- The adventure of life.
978083 979083 Right.
979250 980708 It's been a challenging few years.
980875 982750 Haven't seen you guys in a while.
982917 985000 Been through a lot, change of life.
985167 987083 - Menopause?<br />- Bitch, are you improv-ing?
987250 988833 - Mm-mm.<br />- Sorry.
989792 991167 I'm sorry that you had to see that, Yukio.
991333 992417 It's okay.
994708 995750 But I'm happy.
996167 997417 You know, and that's, that's...
997583 1000375 because of each and every one of you.
1000750 1002208 I guess, what I'm trying to say is...
1002375 1003750 how proud I am, how grateful I am...
1003917 1005167 to be standing in a room...
1005333 1008000 with every single person I love.
1013583 1015208 I'm the luckiest man alive.
1017708 1018792 Make a wish, buddy.
1018958 1020292 Ten-four, good buddy.
1021500 1022625 Going down.
1029000 1029875 Wade Wilson?
1030041 1032958 Oh, yeah. Dancers.<br />Dopinder must have ordered you.
1033458 1034791 Are those supposed to be cop costumes?
1035166 1036125 Never mind.
1036791 1040125 Take your clothes off but leave the helmets.<br />And this isn't <i>Pretty Woman.</i>
1041083 1042375 We're kissing. All right?
1042541 1044166 What song do you guys normally dance to?
1045541 1048375 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
1048667 1049875 Is that supposed to be scary?
1050042 1053667 Pegging isn't new for me, friendo.<br />But it is for Disney.
1054083 1054917 Ah, ta, ta, ta!
1055208 1059042 Okay, I've never been a natural bottom,<br />so we're gonna take things real slow.
1059208 1061083 And I want some crazy eye contact.
1061250 1062292 Not you.<br />You.
1062750 1064542 Can't see your eyes through the mask,<br />but I can feel them.
1064708 1066292 We're gonna move on down the hallway...
1066458 1069625 so we can spare a cleanup on aisle asshole.<br />How does everyone feel about this plan?
1069792 1072750 - I don't like you.<br />- Yes. Let's hold on to that attitude.
1072917 1074625 And we're gonna do it angry.
1092750 1093917 Mr. Wilson...
1095833 1098708 you appear to have soiled yourself<br />while unconscious.
1098875 1101125 I wasn't unconscious. Who are you?
1101458 1103250 I go by the name of Paradox.
1103417 1106833 Mr. Paradox.<br />And you're sitting here at the TVA.
1107000 1109000 The Time Variance Authority.
1109167 1111417 We're really a watchdog organization...
1111583 1115292 except we're more lighthearted<br />than that sounds with a sort of...
1115458 1117542 throwback, ironic twist.
1117708 1121917 And we're in charge of defending<br />what's known as the Sacred Timeline.
1122083 1125250 Holy fuck. That is a shit-ton of exposition<br />for a threequel.
1125417 1127292 Is this because I used Cable's time machine?
1127458 1130083 Brought a couple of people back to life,<br />then I destroyed it.
1130250 1131625 - That was a long time ago.<br />- Yes...
1131792 1134458 we're aware of your abuse of your timeline.
1134625 1136750 And you were so abusive of it.
1137542 1139417 No, it has nothing to do with that.
1139583 1140667 Walk with me.
1146542 1150750 I brought you here, Mr. Wilson,<br />to tell you that you're special.
1151500 1154375 In fact,<br />you've been chosen for a higher purpose...
1154542 1156250 a purpose unclear even to me.
1156667 1158708 But one that could...
1158875 1161792 save the entire Sacred Timeline...
1161958 1164542 from a possibly grisly fate<br />sometime in the future...
1164708 1169000 which may very well need to be... avenged.
1169292 1170667 This Sacred Timeline...
1171750 1173667 I assume I'm going to marvel...
1174167 1175208 at how...
1175875 1177625 cinematic it feels?
1177792 1179792 Gratuitous cameos...
1179958 1181792 indiscriminate use of Variants,<br />the whole package?
1181958 1184083 Well, you tell me.
1190875 1191708 Cap!
1198958 1201458 You are no longer lost, Wade.
1201625 1204083 You can be a hero among heroes.
1204625 1206792 We've been surveilling you for quite a while.
1206958 1209708 - Subway station.<br />- A TVA outpost, yes.
1210917 1212042 - And what is that?<br />- Hmm?
1215083 1216458 Is that me? Is that Thor?
1217958 1219167 Is he crying?
1219333 1221125 Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
1221292 1222625 That happens in the distant future.
1222792 1225000 - Why is Thor crying? Quick! Tell me.<br />- Do not speak to her.
1225167 1226000 Stop that. Eyes on me.
1226167 1228375 I brought you here<br />to offer you an opportunity.
1228542 1231792 The opportunity you sought years ago,<br />but for which you were not ready.
1231958 1233583 We believe you're ready now.
1233750 1235625 Ready for a chance to leave your timeline...
1235792 1238125 and join the greatest universe of all.
1238292 1239833 I am about to give you the thing<br />you've always wanted.
1240000 1241542 Oh, I smell what you're steppin' in.
1241708 1244125 The power in the Marvel Universe<br />is about to change forever.
1246500 1248167 I am the Messiah...
1249958 1252125 I am...
1253708 1254958 Marvel Jesus.
1256375 1259083 Can you excuse me for just a moment?<br />I'm just gonna go over here.
1262500 1263875 Suck it, Fox!
1264042 1265333 I'm going to Disneyland.
1265875 1266750 Get fucked!
1270500 1272458 - Where do I sign?<br />- Oh, there's no need for paperwork.
1272625 1274833 Good. Not to brag, but I do not read.
1275000 1277917 - Oh.<br />- There is one thing I will need, though.
1282417 1284500 Oh, fuck off!
1284667 1286625 Adorn me, Beardo.
1307250 1308208 Fuckin' A!
1309250 1311083 It's perfect! FYI...
1311250 1314083 your tailor is a predator,<br />but I love it. Snug.
1314250 1318625 No camel toe.<br />New car smell and adamantium katanas?
1319000 1320458 You shouldn't have.
1320792 1322917 Go ahead. Take it in.
1323083 1325583 And yes, your underwear is getting tighter.
1325750 1327375 That guy knows what I'm talking about.
1327542 1329042 His clothes says middle management...
1329208 1331667 but his eyes say fuck-y fuck-y.
1331833 1333500 Yes. You look very nice.
1333667 1336708 "Nice?" Your buddy here is ready to<br />throw it all away for me.
1336875 1338083 - You callin' your wife?<br />- HR.
1338250 1339417 Does your wife work in HR?
1339583 1341667 I'm really glad you're taking this so well.
1342000 1343792 Oh. I'm taking it well.
1343958 1346917 I have never had a problem<br />traveling for work. That said...
1347083 1348250 we should talk vacation days.
1348625 1351042 I'm more of a<br />one-week-on-one-week-off kind of guy.
1351208 1352542 I think it's what they do in Denmark.
1352708 1355167 You know, you'll never see a<br />Danish flag on the moon, but...
1355333 1356417 goddamn it, they're happy.
1356583 1359083 Now, let's power up your little<br />Amazon Fire phone there...
1359250 1362458 and zip me back home so I can let my friends<br />know that they've been upgraded...
1362625 1363667 to disciples.
1363833 1366833 Yeah. I don't think you... quite understand.
1367667 1371875 You will not be returning to your home<br />because there will be no home to return to.
1372042 1372875 Come again?
1373042 1374083 This time in my ears.
1378458 1381375 This is your universe, Mr. Wilson.
1382000 1383250 That...
1383417 1387500 is what happens when a universe<br />loses their Anchor Being.
1387667 1389750 See how it decays from the inside?
1389917 1392583 - This is how a reality dies.<br />- What's an Anchor Being?
1392750 1396083 An Anchor Being is an entity of<br />such vital importance that when they die...
1396250 1399750 their whole world<br />slowly withers out of existence.
1399917 1402542 You've just won the lottery<br />because I didn't die.
1402708 1404417 It was just a little midlife crisis.<br />I'm better now.
1404583 1406000 Oh, no, no, no.
1410708 1413417 - Oh, my God.<br />- Oh, I love to laugh.
1413583 1416292 Can you imagine if you were the Anchor Being?
1418250 1420750 - Yeah.<br />- No, it isn't you, Mr. Wilson.
1421583 1425875 Your Anchor Being died<br />in an act of self-sacrifice so epic...
1426292 1428417 that it sent shivers down the Timeline.
1428792 1431625 I am referring, of course, to...
1433042 1436750 Logan. The Wolverine.
1440292 1442625 <i>Don't be what they made you.</i>
1453000 1455167 <i>So this is what it feels like...</i>
1457000 1458000 Logan.
1458917 1459917 Of course.
1460667 1461500 Logan.
1464417 1465708 Logan?
1465875 1467833 The guy with forks for hands?
1468000 1469250 That Wolverine?
1470625 1474667 Yeah, I got it. You can turn your retro<br />graphics of death off now. Make it stop.
1474833 1477292 We're not doing it, Mr. Wilson.<br />We certainly can't stop it.
1479708 1480667 How long have we got?
1480833 1483167 In most cases, couple thousand years.
1483333 1485333 - Well, sweet.<br />- Well, most cases aren't fast enough.
1485500 1486458 Not for me.
1487042 1488042 What does that mean?
1488208 1490292 It means that I have been tasked...
1490458 1492708 with overseeing the end of your universe.
1492875 1495500 And regardless of what the<br />pencil pushers upstairs would prefer...
1495667 1496792 I will not...
1497250 1500542 waste my life watching it die slowly<br />of natural causes.
1500708 1502875 We used to just prune these things. Simple.
1503042 1504750 Elegant. Efficient. But I'm told the TVA...
1504917 1507167 doesn't like to do that anymore.<br />Well I do.
1507333 1509667 And no matter what my so-called<br />superiors say, the multiverse...
1509833 1511500 does not need a babysitter.
1511667 1513458 We need a mercy killer.
1513625 1515042 And in this instance...
1515208 1517625 I am the mercy killer.
1522708 1524625 What in the MacGuffin is that?
1524792 1526958 That's a Time Ripper, Mr. Wilson.
1527125 1528667 An accelerant.
1528833 1533417 Once completed, it will allow me to destroy<br />the spacetime matrix of your universe.
1533583 1535583 You see, I don't want to work for the TVA.
1535750 1537833 I want to be the TVA.
1538000 1540542 And the first step involves<br />showing this organization...
1540708 1542375 how much more efficient it can become.
1542542 1546833 To wit, I will be giving your universe<br />a swift and compassionate end.
1547000 1548417 And don't worry,<br />your friends won't feel a thing.
1548583 1550375 It'll be over just like this.<br />"Oh, what's that?"
1551750 1552833 Trust me.
1565542 1567708 You're gonna Old Yeller my fucking universe?
1567875 1570083 Mm... In your parlance, yes.
1570250 1571292 Two in the heart, one in the head.
1571708 1573667 Look, Mr. Wilson, you have two choices.
1573833 1577042 You can either rejoin your loved ones<br />and collectively cease to exist in...
1577208 1580042 I'd say, seventy-two hours. Or...
1580208 1582750 you join the Sacred Timeline.
1582917 1585167 And you end your days of<br />insignificance...
1585333 1587250 and mediocrity.
1587417 1588333 Wade.
1589042 1590750 Wade, you can finally...
1590917 1593333 finally, matter.
1603083 1605125 That's all I've ever really wanted.
1605292 1606542 I know.
1607167 1608167 I know.
1609125 1612625 And you know I'm,<br />I'm nothing if not morally flexible.
1615125 1616083 Yep, yep.
1618417 1619417 I'll do it.
1619583 1622000 Wise choice.<br />The Sacred Timeline's happy to have you.
1622167 1624000 I was actually talking about<br />finding the Wolverine...
1624167 1625250 and breaking your fucking nose.
1639083 1641417 Find him. Find him!
1641583 1643333 <i>And boy, did he ever.</i>
1645208 1646625 <i>Which brings us back to this.</i>
1648792 1650750 <i>The desecration of the sacred corpse.</i>
1655083 1656292 Oh, my God!
1657708 1660333 Oh! My own fucking arm!
1664458 1665542 Now we're talkin'!
1665667 1666958 Not like this!
1667125 1669083 No, dear God! No!
1669250 1671417 I'm sorry! Wolverine-ing is hard!
1671583 1672583 Make it stop!
1672750 1674500 Mangold tried.
1676750 1678708 You sick fuck!
1678875 1680042 Logan was a hero.
1680333 1683125 And the only thing worth a shit<br />to ever come out of Canada.
1691083 1695375 Get my country's name<br />out of your fuckin' mouth.
1696500 1698083 And my sword. Give me that.
1701542 1703833 Oh, I gotta find me another Logan.
1704292 1705583 An alive one.
1705833 1708000 Don't get up, guys. I'll see myself out.
1715583 1716417 Logan!
1720167 1721792 I'm gonna need you to come with me.
1723083 1724083 Who's asking?
1726250 1728292 Oh, look at this little Hairy Lou Retton.
1728458 1730042 Did you stick the landing, little guy?
1730708 1731542 Yes, you did!
1731708 1733625 Comic accurate short king.
1733792 1735875 Such a cute wittle Wolvie.
1736042 1737750 Cue the fuckin' montage, baby.
1738375 1741417 Ahoy! Everything seems to be on fire.
1741583 1742667 You have a dragon?
1743417 1746333 You have Anchor Being written all over...
1755667 1756667 Patch!
1758708 1759958 Now we're talkin'.
1760583 1761875 Oh, yeah.
1762500 1764417 That's the whole goddamn package right there.
1765417 1766500 Howdy!
1766667 1769167 I'm just... I'm auditioning Anchor Beings.
1769333 1771875 Oh. Yeah, that's gonna need some coconut oil.
1776250 1778083 What in the fuck?
1778500 1780000 Are you okay?
1780500 1781542 Oh, yes, yes.
1781708 1783542 Classic John Byrne brown and tan.
1783708 1785667 Now, you fought the Hulk in this outfit. No?
1788542 1790250 I'm Marvel Jesus, you dull creature,<br />and I will not...
1801125 1803667 It's not you. We're just going<br />in a different direction.
1806958 1809083 You know, from behind,<br />you look a little bit like Henry...
1809250 1810458 Oh, my fuck!
1810792 1813500 The Cavillrine. The legends are true.
1814167 1816917 And may I say, sir,<br />on behalf of all humanity...
1817083 1818792 this just feels right.
1818958 1822042 We will treat you so much better<br />than those shit fucks down the street.
1822208 1823250 You were just leavin'.
1823417 1825583 No, sir.<br />Not while the fate of my universe is at...
1830458 1831875 This one looks promising.
1832042 1832875 Down you go.
1834667 1835500 Again.
1836625 1838583 I told you. You're not welcome here.
1838750 1840167 You're not welcome anywhere.
1840333 1841542 Now get the fuck out of my bar.
1841708 1844167 Just give me one more drink<br />and then I'll leave.
1844333 1845958 That's not how it works.
1846125 1848375 It does now. Leave the bottle.
1848542 1849375 I know you, bub?
1849542 1851625 Nope. But I know you.
1852042 1853417 Everybody knows me.
1855000 1856167 I'm the Wolverine.
1856333 1858125 Yes, you are.
1858292 1860583 And I'm gonna need you<br />to come with me right now.
1862000 1863375 Look, lady, I'm not interested.
1863542 1866250 - Really gettin' into your cups here.<br />- Why would I go with you?
1867458 1869292 Because, unfortunately...
1869458 1870375 I need you...
1870542 1874625 and even more unfortunately,<br />my entire world needs you.
1875458 1876917 You two gonna fuck or fight?
1880875 1882083 You gonna take that from him?
1882458 1883292 Yep.
1884167 1885208 I can tell you have a sort of...
1885375 1887833 don't-get-too-close-I'll-only-<br />break-your-heart vibe going here...
1888000 1890250 but every other Wolverine<br />would've really hurt me by now.
1890417 1893292 And, I'm sort of on the tick-tick.<br />So upsy-daisy. Here we go.
1893458 1895667 - Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey!<br />- Up you go. I got you, big guy.
1899083 1900208 Whiskey dick of the claws.
1900375 1902833 - It's quite common in Wolverines over forty.<br />- You don't want this.
1903000 1905542 You're right. I don't.<br />And you don't want this.
1905708 1908333 Unless you wanna take a deep breath<br />through your fuckin' forehead...
1908500 1910375 I suggest you reconsider.
1910542 1911625 Let's go, peanut.
1916167 1918000 Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
1918708 1919542 Watch this.
1920667 1922708 All right. That... Whoa.
1923375 1924208 Easy.
1928000 1928833 Good God.
1929583 1931333 Thirsty little honey badger, aren't ya?
1932500 1934042 It's okay. Keep goin'.
1934208 1936042 Audiences are accustomed to long run times.
1942083 1943542 Guess you'll have to do.
1944000 1945000 Okay, here we...
1946208 1948542 Oh! Look at those jammies.
1948958 1952208 That only took twenty fucking years.
1952625 1954583 One Anchor Being coming right up!
1954750 1956833 On your left, baby girl.
1957125 1960458 This Logan has the same<br />he-can-do-anything-even-musicals look.
1960625 1961625 And bonus...
1961792 1963083 he's actually wearing a costume...
1963250 1964958 like he's not embarrassed to be in<br />a superhero movie for once.
1965125 1966458 I don't understand.
1966625 1968042 You said my universe is dying...
1968208 1970625 because this sack of nuts<br />got himself killed.
1970792 1973333 - Well, problem solved.<br />- My God.
1973500 1977500 You actually think<br />you can replace an Anchor Being...
1977667 1979083 with this?
1979917 1982958 I wouldn't have accepted any other Wolverine<br />BT dubs. But you...
1983125 1986542 have outdone yourself<br />and brought me the worst Wolverine!
1986708 1987667 What do you mean, the worst one?
1987833 1988792 Mr. Wilson.
1989458 1992583 This Wolverine let down his entire world.
1993458 1995333 He's the stuff of legend,<br />but not in a good way.
1995708 1997000 And what he did...
1997167 1998375 well...
1998542 2000667 some things are just beyond forgiveness.
2003250 2004083 Okay.
2004250 2006917 How do I... How do I make this right?<br />I'll do anything.
2007417 2010375 I gave you a chance at greatness.
2010542 2012833 Because my superiors deemed you special.
2013000 2014500 Clearly not special in a good way.
2014667 2017500 Apparently you have some<br />important future purpose to serve.
2017667 2018792 With Thor. He holds me.
2018958 2022917 But, I did my duty.<br />I gave you the opportunity to be somebody.
2023083 2026292 And instead of accepting my offering<br />with humility and gratitude...
2026458 2027292 you broke my nose.
2027667 2030208 - It looks great.<br />- And you decimated dozens of my men...
2030375 2032000 with the exhumed corpse of a hero.
2032167 2034208 Dishonoring not only his remains<br />but his memory.
2034375 2035417 What are you, the Internet?
2035583 2037750 Your world is dying!
2037917 2038917 Thank you very much.
2039417 2040542 And there's no stopping it.
2042833 2044333 The humane thing to do...
2044500 2045375 is to make it quick.
2045542 2048250 Is the thought of vaporizing my universe<br />making you peckish?
2048417 2049458 I'm eating my feelings.
2049625 2052667 I'm about to lose everything that I've<br />ever cared about because that hairy...
2052833 2054583 thundercunt from down undercunt...
2054750 2057792 finally dies<br />and he's standing right behind me, isn't he?
2058500 2059792 Welcome to the MCU, by the way.
2060417 2061833 You're joining at a bit of a low point.
2062667 2064583 As for you, I wanna talk to your boss.
2064750 2067917 I want you to get him on the phone<br />and you tell him, her, or them...
2068083 2070208 that Marvel H. Christ isn't playing.
2075583 2076542 Holy shit.
2077417 2081208 I just heard a symphony<br />of buttholes clenching all at once.
2081375 2082250 You're off grid.
2082417 2084750 Your bosses don't know what you sick fucks<br />are doing down here.
2084917 2087958 Well, I'll tell you what.<br />I have a black belt in Karen...
2088125 2089417 And I'm gonna go upstairs...
2089583 2091542 and I'm gonna tell 'em all about<br />you and your...
2092667 2094292 Silence is nice, isn't it?
2094458 2095458 Where the fuck did he go?
2095625 2097333 To the trash heap. You'll fit right in.
2100583 2101417 That was close.
2122917 2124792 Don't just stand there, you ape.
2125417 2126458 Give me a hand up.
2128250 2130125 Nope. I'm actually okay.<br />Thank you very much...
2132667 2133500 Where the hell are we?
2133667 2136208 I don't know. Looks kind of Mad Max-y.
2136375 2138250 But that would be IP infringement, right?
2138417 2139583 Fucking jokes.
2142958 2144333 Fuck! Fuck.
2144500 2145833 Were you even listening back there?
2146000 2148667 If we don't make it back to that<br />Mr. Paradox asshole...
2149000 2150167 everyone I know is gonna die.
2150333 2152000 Not my fuckin' problem.
2152167 2153375 Oh, is that all you got?
2154417 2156417 Is that what you said<br />when your world went to shit?
2158875 2159708 Come again?
2159875 2161250 Yeah, I heard all about you.
2161792 2163833 How you screwed up everything.
2164000 2166667 You should be thankin' me<br />for pulling you out of that bed you shit in.
2167375 2169083 You back-stabbing son of a bitch!
2175125 2176542 Are you ready to be calm now?
2183667 2186167 Rest in pieces, Fox.
2200917 2202417 I don't want to fight you, peanut.
2203625 2205083 Doesn't matter what you did.
2205375 2206417 I just need your help.
2208292 2209875 I don't fuckin' care.
2212292 2213125 Uh-oh.
2218625 2221000 Fuck. This is gonna hurt.
2225167 2226500 All right.
2226833 2227667 Fuck it.
2228583 2230458 Let's give the people what they came for.
2231250 2233000 Let's fuckin' go.
2234167 2236167 Get your special sock out, nerds.
2236333 2238167 It's gonna get good.
2291167 2292167 Gotcha!
2298750 2299583 Baby Knife!
2304500 2306292 Let's see you grow your fuckin' head back.
2306458 2308500 Wait, wait, wait! I can fix it! I can fix it.
2308667 2310458 - Fix what?<br />- Whatever it is that you did.
2311375 2312750 Whatever made you so bad.
2313250 2317042 Those, those pricks in the TVA.<br />You heard him.
2318292 2319542 They have the power to end my universe...
2319708 2322792 but they also have the power to change yours.
2324500 2325583 We get back there...
2325750 2328792 and we can fix your world. Together.
2330125 2331208 I promise.
2332708 2333958 They can fix it.
2335083 2336333 Hey!
2336500 2338500 We fight each other, we lose.
2338667 2339917 Dear God, it's him.
2340083 2342083 - Who?<br />- The one.
2342417 2344792 The superhero equivalent<br />to comfort food, or Molly.
2345375 2348708 White guys' answer to all the<br />disappointments. And another A-lister.
2349375 2350750 Fair warning, gorgeous.
2350917 2352875 You're going to encounter<br />some indelicate language...
2353042 2355375 a smidge of ass play,<br />but we've been prohibited...
2355542 2356917 from using cocaine. On camera.
2357083 2357917 They're coming.
2358167 2359667 Who's "they?"
2366250 2367667 Oh, they're driving angry.
2373500 2375542 Now that's a superhero landing.
2382500 2383750 I got this.
2407417 2408250 Stay close.
2408875 2409750 Aye, aye, Cap'n.
2411333 2412292 You got this.
2414625 2418042 Cassandra is gonna be giddy<br />when she sees what we caught.
2419083 2420083 You can't run.
2420250 2421458 Everybody knows that.
2421625 2423750 You see anyone runnin', dick for brains?
2424875 2426542 You're not gonna love what happens next.
2426708 2428167 Oh. Oh, my God.
2428625 2429458 Oh, my God.
2429625 2431833 - Oh, my God, he's gonna say it.<br />- Ah! Fuck.
2432000 2434125 - Oh, my God! He's gonna say it!<br />- Say what?
2434292 2435292 Avengers, assemble...
2435458 2436708 - Flame on!<br />- I'm sorry, what now?
2459833 2460667 Fuck!
2465500 2466583 We don't know that guy.
2466750 2467625 We thought we did.
2467875 2469292 I know you.
2470042 2470875 Holy...
2473417 2474458 Sabretooth.
2475167 2476000 Your brother.
2476917 2478875 Ready to die?
2479042 2481292 Wait, wait, wait!<br />Time!
2482000 2483542 You look ridiculous.
2483792 2486292 People have waited decades for this fight.
2486458 2488125 It's not gonna be easy.<br />Baby Knife.
2488292 2490042 Shoot the double, you take him down.
2490208 2492208 Side control, then full mount...
2492375 2495333 and you ground and pound<br />till he makes no sound because he's dead.
2495500 2496333 Shut the fuck up!
2496500 2497458 Oh, my God!
2497625 2499250 Okay. Good luck. I'm a huge fan.
2512292 2513375 What is it, girl?
2513542 2514667 Is there trouble at the well?
2520875 2521792 Big trouble.
2521958 2523542 Behold!
2523708 2526583 The head of your precious queen...
2526750 2527750 Furiosa!
2528917 2530583 I have the Wolverine!
2530750 2533833 I alone control her!
2534000 2535917 You come for me...
2536417 2538792 you come for her.
2540542 2544167 So sorry. I know it's pronounced "him."<br />I'm gender blind. It's my cross to bear.
2544333 2545292 Who's next?
2545667 2546708 Toad!
2546875 2547750 You're up.
2555500 2557542 - Uh-oh. Oh, holy...<br />- Fuck.
2568458 2570417 God of Thunder.
2574333 2575625 How long was I asleep?
2575792 2577583 Not all of you was asleep.
2577750 2579125 Don't bother.
2579292 2581083 They're very thorough.
2581542 2583583 If you know where we are, start talking.
2584333 2585333 You're in The Void.
2585958 2587250 Think of it as purgatory.
2588125 2590542 Reed called it a metaphysical junkyard.
2590708 2593833 Where anything useless goes<br />before it gets annihilated forever.
2594375 2598375 And where the TVA sends people that don't<br />play nice with the rest of the multiverse.
2598542 2599958 - Like you?<br />- And you.
2600125 2601500 What does the annihilating?
2602083 2602917 Alioth.
2603083 2606750 Alioth is in this thing?<br />From <i>Loki,</i> season one, episode five?
2606917 2608833 Everyone here is on the run from Alioth.
2609500 2610958 Most don't make it.
2611125 2612417 There's a resistance, though.
2613208 2615958 Other people like us that managed to survive.
2616292 2620125 They're hidin' out in the borderlands,<br />trying to find a way the fuck outta here.
2620292 2621625 Then that's where we go.
2621792 2623500 "We?" Us? A team?
2623667 2625458 The answer is yes.<br />Shake on it.
2626208 2627458 Fuck! You nicked it.
2627625 2629458 Just got the tip with<br />your little steak knife.
2629625 2631583 These "others" can help us<br />get back to the TVA.
2631750 2632667 Make 'em fix things.
2634958 2635958 Something funny, bub?
2636583 2638292 She might have somethin' to say about that.
2638458 2639417 Who's "she?"
2640708 2641792 In The Void...
2642042 2643708 you're either food for Alioth...
2644500 2646542 or you work for her.
2718875 2720833 Huh. Paul Rudd finally aged.
2721958 2723333 You must be this year's Juggernaut.
2723708 2725250 - Thank you.<br />- I'd keep your voices down.
2725417 2726542 She don't like the chatter.
2726708 2727958 She's gonna love you.
2744083 2745500 Is it... Is that Charles?
2745792 2747958 Hey... Hey, Chuck! It's us!
2748125 2749292 That's not Chuck.
2749458 2750583 Ah, shit.
2752042 2753500 Oh, ableism. Great.
2753667 2756083 That's not gonna go over well<br />with the woke mob.
2756250 2757708 A Wolverine.
2758208 2760500 I wondered when I'd get one of you.
2761250 2762417 You're one of Xavier's.
2762583 2764042 You-You know him? You know Chuck?
2764208 2765292 Oh, I knew him.
2765583 2767083 We shared a womb.
2767292 2770792 Tried to strangle the sly little fellow<br />with my umbilical cord.
2770958 2773958 Amen. I've never loved roommates.<br />Mine's blind.
2774292 2775667 Except she can see cocaine.
2775917 2777417 For some... reason.
2777583 2780292 You want to chime in, Your Majesty?<br />I'm dying here.
2780458 2781583 Who are you?
2781750 2784458 Charles Xavier's twin, Cassandra Nova.
2784792 2786167 - Bullshit!<br />- I was an anal birth.
2787042 2788250 You two are cute.
2789167 2790500 I have a good feeling about this.
2793542 2794667 And I've been trying to catch...
2794833 2796542 this little firefly for years.
2797333 2798917 Haven't I, Johnny?
2799083 2802292 Aw... You picked the wrong time<br />to make new friends.
2802458 2804792 Oh, Johnny told us all about you.
2804958 2806250 - Maybe shut up now.<br />- Yeah, maybe don't...
2806417 2807500 We're just talkin' here.
2807667 2810833 Yeah, Johnny told us<br />you're a psychotic megalomaniacal asshole.
2811000 2811750 His words, not mine.
2811917 2814292 Hellbent on domination and pain.
2815500 2817458 - You said all that about me?<br />- No!
2817625 2820958 - No! I don't... I didn't say any of that!<br />- Sticks and stones, Johnny!
2822583 2824583 Don't let her intimidate you.
2824750 2826333 It's like you said in the convoy.
2826500 2829333 This finger-lickin' dead-inside<br />pixie slab of...
2829500 2831208 third rate dime-store nut-milk...
2831375 2833167 can eat your delicious cinnamon ring...
2833333 2835333 - and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.<br />- Okay.
2835500 2837333 I have never said any of those words...
2837500 2839542 - in my entire life!<br />- Ha! The modesty.
2839708 2842583 People think I'm a shit talker.<br />But this guy...
2842958 2843792 Next level.
2843958 2845875 What? This... I... We...
2846042 2847458 I don't even know what half of that means!
2847625 2850125 - This... I... What? This...<br />- My hat's off to you, sir. Truly.
2850292 2851500 I didn't... He's... That's...
2852292 2853375 I don't...
2858917 2859833 Not my favorite Chris.
2860000 2862500 You stupid piece of shit.<br />You just got him fucking killed!
2862667 2864417 Hey! We're all grieving!
2864583 2866625 PS, do you know what<br />he was doing to the budget?
2869333 2871167 Alioth is hungry.
2872083 2873667 There's been some kind of mistake.
2873833 2875542 Big yellow is a back up Anchor Being...
2875708 2878125 and I'm Marvel Jesus. MJ, if you're nasty.
2878292 2879333 This may be hard to hear...
2879500 2882167 but there's another British villain<br />who's gonna destroy my universe...
2882333 2883333 and I'm gonna stop him.
2883500 2886375 Oh, honey, you don't really strike me as<br />the world-saving type.
2888917 2889875 Did I hit a nerve?
2890958 2892250 I didn't want it to come to this.
2893125 2894042 Either you help us...
2894208 2897167 or my friend here is gonna sing<br />the entire second act of <i>Music Man...</i>
2897333 2898500 with zero warm-up.
2899375 2900583 Where'd you get the chair?
2900750 2903250 Well, once in a while,<br />I do get a Charles through here.
2903667 2905042 Never mine, though.
2905208 2908375 No. He didn't care to find me.
2909542 2912042 Gen Z and their trauma-bragging!
2912208 2914750 Can't you just stuff it down,<br />turn it into accomplishment...
2914917 2916542 or cancer like the rest of us?
2916708 2918375 But I'm not like the rest of you.
2918542 2920292 Except maybe the Wolverine.
2920458 2922917 Now, we could be truly terrifying together.
2923083 2924333 You're that scary, huh?
2924500 2926333 The TVA certainly thought so.
2926917 2929042 They sent me here before I could walk.
2929500 2932167 And you know, it's the best thing<br />that ever happened to me.
2932625 2933542 I love it here.
2933708 2935167 You live in a garbage dump.
2935333 2938083 I think we both know who lives<br />in the garbage dump.
2938458 2939917 The Void is a paradise.
2940250 2944083 I can wield my power here without shame.
2944458 2947750 Unfortunately I had no Charles Xavier<br />to teach me temperance.
2948458 2950292 What about your Charles?
2950458 2951583 Did he protect you?
2952375 2954458 Did he make you feel safe?
2954625 2956542 We're mutants. We're never safe.
2964750 2966833 Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br />I don't... I don't want the smoke.
2967500 2970125 I don't have any beef with you.<br />I just want to save my friends.
2970292 2971625 I just... I want to go home.
2971792 2973458 Well, the thing is, I could get you home.
2973625 2975208 - Good.<br />- But I don't want to.
2975375 2976667 Not good.
2979833 2982125 What do you want, Wade Wilson?
2982625 2986000 Your... fingers are inside me,<br />but not in a good way.
2986167 2989125 My brother could<br />enter one's mind with a thought.
2989292 2991625 I have to get my hands dirty.
2994500 2995833 I've got you.
2998250 2999375 <i>I've got you...</i>
3002000 3002917 <i>What do you mean?</i>
3005083 3007500 I can't, I can't reach you. You're not here.
3007667 3009083 I'm right here.
3009542 3012375 - No, you're not. I can't...<br />- I'm right here.
3012542 3014542 Then show me. You got to do something.
3015958 3016833 Show you what?
3017417 3020167 Show me you care about<br />something bigger than you.
3021292 3025083 <i>Ever since they turned you down,<br />you took a knee.</i>
3025917 3027875 Baby, you never got back up.
3030083 3033667 I know you're going through something.<br />Let me go through it with you.
3035083 3037083 - Your crazy matches my crazy.<br />- Your crazy matches my crazy.
3040708 3041708 Where'd you go?
3042333 3043667 Oh, my God.
3046667 3048333 <i>You just say it. Okay?</i>
3049375 3050208 <i>Say, "I don't want you.</i>
3050375 3051667 <i>"I don't want to be with you."</i>
3052833 3054167 <i>Go ahead. Say it. Say, say, "I don't..."</i>
3054333 3055417 Say it. You don't wanna be with me.
3055875 3058208 <i>Tell me that and I'll walk away.<br />Say, "I don't want you."</i>
3065042 3065875 Fuck...
3066042 3068583 You'll never fucking matter.
3072458 3074167 What?
3074542 3077292 - You'll never fucking matter.<br />- Fucking matter.
3083750 3085625 - <i>You'll...</i><br />- <i>You'll...</i>
3085792 3087167 - never...<br />- <i>never...</i>
3087750 3088917 - fucking...<br />- <i>fucking...</i>
3089083 3091875 - matter.<br />- <i>matter...</i>
3093917 3095292 She never said that.
3095458 3096417 No.
3096583 3098458 But I bet she thought it.
3100583 3102208 You are so mean!
3102375 3105000 My brain could taste your fingers,<br />and they tasted like hate!
3105708 3108208 And where in God's name<br />is the intimacy coordinator?
3108375 3110625 You're so lost, Mr. Wilson.
3111167 3113417 And long before you came here.
3114917 3117333 This is Baby Knife.<br />She's gonna fuck you in the face now.
3117583 3120542 If you want to kill me,<br />it's going to take more than a little blade.
3120833 3121708 How about six?
3123708 3125542 My boy's wicked strong.
3126042 3127583 That's my big boy.
3127875 3129208 Yes, you are.
3135042 3136625 Well, this has been fun.
3137042 3139208 But the big guy needs to eat<br />and the rent is due.
3142625 3143458 By the way...
3143625 3145042 you're the rent.
3165208 3167042 Come on! Fuck!
3167208 3168292 You comin' or what?
3168458 3169333 Coming!
3189542 3190542 What you thinkin' 'bout?
3190708 3191750 Get the fuck off of me!
3192292 3193167 Almost done.
3193333 3194417 Almost done what?
3194583 3196958 Getting my knife out of your buttocks,<br />pervert!
3197125 3198042 Fuck!
3198208 3199917 Get your mind out of my pants!
3200083 3200917 I'm telling Blake.
3201083 3202125 New rules.
3202667 3203500 I talk now.
3203667 3207083 - That's gonna be very hard on the audience.<br />- Shut the fuck up!
3207833 3208708 Let me fuckin' think.
3209000 3210833 Now we gotta get back to Paradox, right?
3212917 3213750 Right?
3215625 3218917 - Am I allowed to speak now or...<br />- Just nod, asshole.
3220542 3221458 Right.
3221625 3224458 Then we find the others that poor kid, Johnny<br />was talking about before you got him killed!
3224625 3226250 "Poor kid." He's like fifty!
3226417 3228917 Yeah, if there's a chance they know<br />how to get out of here, we find 'em.
3229083 3232458 And make those TVA fuckers fix my shit<br />like you fucking promised!
3232625 3233833 I smell quest.
3236583 3237583 I smell food.
3241000 3244333 So what made you finally wear an<br />honest-to-God costume?
3246042 3248125 Mine's red so they can't see me bleed.
3248292 3250958 But I could see how<br />yellow would be useful too.
3251125 3252667 Have you been checked for ADHD?
3252833 3253875 Mm-mm.
3254125 3256250 But I've had several STDs, which...
3256417 3258125 were probably caused by ADHD.
3258292 3259083 Fuck!
3260542 3261500 What are you looking for?
3262792 3263792 Thank fuck.
3264833 3266625 No, no, no. That's rubbing alcohol.
3266792 3269375 You don't want to drink...<br />Oh, yeah. There you go. Fuck that liver.
3271083 3272792 Good. Okay.
3273833 3274958 What the fuck are those?
3276625 3279417 Back in civilian life, I wear a toupee,<br />but nobody knows.
3282500 3284000 Everybody knows.
3286792 3288500 Wanna talk about what's haunting you, or...
3288667 3290583 should we wait for a third act flashback?
3291250 3292500 Go fuck yourself.
3295833 3296667 You know...
3298542 3299958 in my world, you're...
3302000 3303250 You're well regarded.
3303542 3304833 Yeah, well, not in mine.
3306042 3309250 - They don't like me much in mine either.<br />- You don't say.
3309500 3311125 I wanted to be something, you know. I...
3312208 3313875 Shit, I wanted to be an Avenger.
3314125 3315958 - Fuck the Avengers.<br />- Yeah.
3316458 3318542 I didn't make the cut, though.<br />Same with the X-Men...
3320667 3321667 When my girlfriend left me...
3321833 3322958 - and then I just...<br />- You had a girlfriend?
3323500 3324542 Yeah.
3325042 3325875 Vanessa.
3326542 3327958 When we met, she was a dancer.
3329167 3330167 We had a whole life.
3331458 3332458 It was good.
3333250 3334625 But, oh, boy, I just...
3336583 3338083 Fucked that right up.
3338958 3340000 But you.
3340167 3341292 You were an X-Man.
3341625 3343458 Fuck that. You were the X-Man. You...
3345375 3346542 The Wolverine.
3348917 3350458 He was a hero in my world.
3352375 3353208 Yeah, well...
3354625 3355792 he ain't shit in mine.
3361333 3363833 You said, "Logan was a hero."<br />What happened?
3364708 3365542 He died.
3366292 3367125 How?
3368000 3370500 Well, technically,<br />you were chest-fucked by a tree, but...
3370667 3373250 really, you just ran out of batteries<br />trying to save someone.
3373417 3374250 Who?
3374625 3377917 The shitheels that grew her in a lab<br />called her "X-23." But...
3378667 3379792 she was just a kid.
3380583 3384000 A younger, daintier,<br />somehow meaner version of you.
3384167 3385542 You died trying to save her.
3385917 3386750 It was beautiful.
3387500 3389792 Look, <i>mijo,</i> I know you're hurtin'.
3390542 3394167 My blind, elderly, African-American roommate,<br />Blind Al, always says that...
3394333 3396000 pain teaches us who we are.
3396167 3398708 Sometimes we need to listen to that pain<br />instead of running from it.
3398875 3400542 - Holy shit.<br />- Yeah, she's wise.
3400708 3403083 No, no, no. That's her name?<br />You call her "Blind Al?"
3403250 3404250 Well, she's blind.
3441875 3443125 Look at you!
3443292 3444292 She's coming with us.
3444458 3446333 - No, she's not. Fuck no!<br />- Oh, yes, she is.
3446500 3448417 - Oh, yes...<br />- Sorry!
3448792 3450167 Sorry about that!
3450583 3451708 Come here, girl!
3452667 3453875 Who are you?
3454042 3455333 Oh, I'm Deadpool.
3455500 3456792 And I guess you're Deadpool too.
3456958 3458958 But in here, everybody calls me "Nicepool."
3459375 3462333 Oh, my goodness. Wait till you see Ladypool.<br />She is gorgeous.
3462500 3463875 She just had a baby too. And...
3464625 3465458 Can't even tell.
3465625 3466958 I don't think you're supposed to say that.
3467125 3467958 That's okay.
3468625 3470125 I identify as a feminist.
3470292 3471167 Right.
3472958 3475958 Are those gold-plated,<br />...50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros?
3476125 3477250 'Course.
3477625 3478792 To match my ear huggie.
3478958 3479833 Can I have 'em?
3480792 3482125 Over my dead body.
3482458 3483333 You're fun.
3483500 3487833 And I guess you've already met Mary Puppins.<br />AKA Dogpool.
3488000 3489042 Careful where you put your hands.
3489208 3492042 She's ninety percent g-spot,<br />and she'll let you know it.
3492208 3495625 You let this little flirt out of your sight<br />for one second and...
3495792 3497833 she starts shopping for a new papa.
3498000 3502458 If you can't be a responsible pet owner, then<br />maybe you don't deserve this little unicorn.
3502750 3504417 Guilty on all charges, Your Honor.
3504958 3505958 Shan't happen again.
3506125 3507458 Why are you so nice?
3507625 3509000 Oh, it costs nothing to be kind.
3509167 3510917 Shutting the fuck up is also free.
3511583 3512458 This is Logan.
3512625 3515375 He's usually shirtless,<br />but he's let himself go since the divorce.
3516708 3518250 Where's your mask?
3520958 3521792 Come on, guys.
3523458 3524542 Ugh, this guy.
3524708 3526208 We're looking for a group of survivors.
3526375 3527208 Oh, they're out there.
3527375 3530750 Yeah, but merc to merc, you better hope<br />that you don't run into the Deadpool corps.
3530917 3531875 Yeah, they're crazy.
3532042 3535000 They will chop you up into a thousand pieces<br />and hide you all over The Void.
3535167 3537000 If they could only process<br />their childhood trauma...
3537167 3538750 they'd go on one heck of a healing journey.
3538917 3539917 Look, we're headed for the borderlands.
3540083 3541042 You know where it is?
3541333 3545542 Yeah, that... That's twelve klicks due west.<br />I can lend you my ride, if you like.
3545708 3547417 It would be my honor.
3551083 3553125 No, no, no. Absolutely not.
3553292 3555167 Uh-uh. What the...<br />No! No!
3555333 3556250 Just get in the car.
3556417 3557500 This isn't a car.
3557667 3559875 This is a Honda fuckin' Odyssey.
3560042 3561917 Throttle response sucks a cock.
3562083 3563208 Dated infotainment system.
3563375 3566000 When Honda saw that untreated chlamydia<br />was makin' a comeback...
3566167 3568958 they invented the Honda Odyssey to compete.
3569125 3571833 Get in the fucking car.
3572167 3573958 She'll get you there safe and sound.
3574125 3575583 Old Betsy always does.
3576458 3578375 You're gonna have to<br />give me my dog back, though.
3578750 3581250 I know. Listen. Yes, child.
3581417 3583875 If you ever wanna give her up,<br />or if she needs a new home...
3584042 3585917 or if something<br />should happen to you...
3586083 3587292 I'd love to be her papa.
3588000 3589625 What would ever happen to me?
3589792 3590833 Lots of stuff.
3594542 3596792 - Jesus.<br />- No! We're running away.
3597833 3599542 - Give me that.<br />- The corn was too dense, girl!
3599708 3600542 - There.<br />- Come here!
3600708 3601958 - Fuck!<br />- Hello!
3604250 3605250 Bye.
3631042 3632042 Okay, I'm just gonna ask...
3632417 3633583 What's with the suit?
3633750 3635208 First thing I did when I flamed out...
3635375 3636375 - I took mine off.<br />- Drop it.
3636542 3637500 It's not that ugly.
3637667 3639250 - Stop talking about my suit.<br />- Did you make it yourself?
3639417 3640833 - Been there.<br />- Quit. Now.
3641000 3644083 The X-Men make you wear it?<br />Those sons of fuckin' bitches.
3644250 3645750 They are not your friends,<br />I'll tell you that.
3645917 3646917 Friends don't let friends...
3647083 3649958 leave the house lookin' like they<br />fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams.
3650125 3651208 Shut the fuck up about this, or...
3651375 3653583 Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />Watch your frown lines, angel baby.
3653750 3655917 - I'm just trying to bond a little bit.<br />- Yeah, well, then talk about somethin' else.
3656083 3657000 Fine.
3664167 3665208 Stop it.
3666917 3667750 If they can fix your world...
3667917 3669542 what's the first thing you're gonna do<br />when you get out of here?
3669708 3672833 Get some rubbing alcohol shots,<br />maybe a wiper fluid chaser?
3673000 3673917 What did you say?
3674083 3675708 I said when you get back,<br />what's the first thing you're gonna do?
3675875 3677208 No, no, no. Before that.
3678458 3680125 If... they can fix your world?
3684250 3685708 What do you mean, "if?"
3686542 3687375 - I mean...<br />- You lied to me.
3687542 3690083 You don't have a fucking clue<br />if they can help me fix things, do you?
3690250 3691333 No. I, I mean...
3692000 3694792 Fuck! Fuck! I didn't lie!
3694958 3697625 - You lied!<br />- No! I made an educated wish!
3699500 3700458 Because I need you.
3701792 3704792 This. This is why. Right here.
3705833 3707333 'Cause if we don't do something, they die.
3707750 3709667 I don't know anything about saving worlds.
3709833 3711375 And why would I even care?
3711542 3714458 Because my entire world<br />is right here in this picture.
3714917 3716917 It's only nine people...
3717083 3719125 and I have no idea how to save it alone.
3720250 3722333 I know how to fuck people up for money.<br />But you...
3722500 3724083 you know how to save 'em!
3725333 3726542 At least the other Wolverine did.
3727792 3730208 Fuck! I guess I'm stuck with the worst one.
3730375 3732625 Did you say you made...
3732792 3736083 an educated fucking wish?
3736250 3738375 They call me "The Merc with the Mouth."
3738542 3742417 They don't call me "Truthful Timmy,<br />the Blowjob Queen of Saskatoon."
3746292 3747208 One more word.
3748500 3749958 Please give me one.
3753583 3754750 Gubernatorial.
3755500 3756500 Oh, fuck!
3758125 3759542 You know what? You're a fucking joke.
3761333 3762750 No wonder the Avengers didn't take you.
3762917 3765042 Or the X-Men.<br />And they'll take fucking anyone.
3765542 3766917 I mean, you are...
3767083 3770625 a ridiculous, immature, half-wit moron.
3771250 3772958 I have never met...
3773125 3774333 a sadder...
3774500 3776875 more attention-starved,<br />jabbering little prick...
3777042 3780458 in my entire life. And that says a lot,<br />'cause I've been alive...
3780625 3784458 for more than two hundred fuckin' years,<br />and I'll tell you...
3784625 3788833 that bald chick was right about one thing.<br />You will never save the world!
3789000 3791500 You couldn't even save a relationship...
3791667 3793542 with a goddamn stripper!
3793708 3796167 And motherfucker,<br />I wish I could say you'd die alone...
3796333 3799250 but it's one of God's best jokes<br />that you can't die...
3799417 3800917 except that's on all of us!
3805000 3807458 Oh, you got nothing to say, Mouth?
3816125 3817792 I'm gonna fight you now.
3820000 3821250 Oh, are you?
3831958 3833958 Mm. Not talkin' now, are ya?
3840625 3841667 You dirty bitch.
3857375 3858208 Whoo!
3874792 3876000 No, no, no!
3894833 3895667 Baby Knife!
3899417 3902500 I take it all back.<br />The Honda Odyssey fucks hard.
3902917 3904375 Too bad you don't, needle dick.
3904542 3905750 Oh, we're just gettin' started, bub.
3910333 3911583 Oh, you... Fuck!
3964500 3965333 Thor!
3968417 3969333 Where are we?
3969500 3972125 No clue, but... I like it here.
3980292 3982125 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
4031167 4032083 Okay.
4033000 4035833 Look at you... all. You must be the others.
4036542 4037375 Terrific.
4037708 4041042 So just to refresh, you are...
4041208 4043583 - Wonder... Elektra? Yes. Who could forget?<br />- Elektra.
4044417 4049125 And you. I was not expecting to see you here.<br />I thought you were, you know...
4049292 4050250 retired.
4051500 4052333 Retarded?
4053833 4054792 "Retired."
4054958 4057167 I'm already in The Void.<br />I'm not trying to get canceled again.
4057333 4058083 I don't like you.
4058250 4059083 You never did.
4060792 4064500 And who's this succulent reminder<br />of my own inadequacies?
4064667 4065750 Look at you.
4066417 4068500 You look like the<br />superhero version of Hawkeye.
4069125 4071917 The name's Remy LeBeau, <i>Le Diable Blanc.</i>
4072625 4073583 But you can call me the Gambit.
4073750 4076500 It's been a while since I've seen<br /><i>Sling Blade</i>. Hit me again.
4077583 4078542 They call me the Gambit.
4078708 4081167 Do they? Are you sure you didn't just<br />really, really want them to...
4081333 4082458 but it never quite worked out?
4085333 4087625 You know,<br />we never had a Wolverine up in here.
4088417 4091375 But I can tell you now,<br />it's just a common courtesy to ask...
4091542 4093208 before you drink up all of my liquor.
4093500 4095542 Well, it's a good thing I don't give a fuck.
4098750 4099582 Fuck.
4102707 4103832 So embarrassing.
4106042 4108707 Well, now that that's settled, look,<br />we came a long way to find you three.
4108875 4109667 There's four of us.
4109832 4111707 There's four... Hey, wait. Is it Magneto?
4112542 4114875 Dear sweet God in heaven,<br />let it be Magneto...
4115042 4115917 - because with him...<br />- He's dead.
4116082 4117957 Fuck!<br />Now Disney gets cheap?
4118125 4121250 It's like Pinocchio jammed his face in my ass<br />and started lying like crazy.
4121417 4122500 Ooh, you nasty!
4124667 4127375 Not a single word. What do you do exactly?
4127542 4130125 Charge the playing cards<br />and make 'em go boom!
4130292 4132250 Your power's close up magic. That's good.
4132417 4133832 We're not totally fucked at all.
4134000 4135500 So who brought us here?
4135667 4136582 That would be me.
4146917 4147750 Don't make me regret it.
4150000 4152917 Holy shit. Logan. That's her.<br />That's X-23.
4153417 4154917 She's the one I told you about.
4159457 4161542 Hey, how did you all get stuck in The Void?
4161707 4163082 There was a knock at the door.
4163250 4165167 - TVA sent me here.<br />- Me, too.
4165332 4167500 Well, maybe I was born here.<br />It's, it's hard to know for sure.
4167832 4170042 TVA decided our universe was dying.
4171332 4173207 And I never even got a chance<br />to fight for it.
4176042 4178125 People like us don't go quietly.
4178292 4180125 TVA knows that, so they took us out.
4180832 4182832 The answer is yes. I'm in.
4183000 4184417 - In what?<br />- A team.
4185082 4186957 Me, you, you, and me. All of us together.
4187125 4188207 Let's get the fuck out of this place.
4188375 4191792 - Don't listen to him. He's a fucking liar!<br />- It was an educated wish!
4192832 4193667 Look.
4195208 4196875 We've been inside Cassandra's lair.
4197208 4199750 The only way out of The Void<br />is through her.
4199917 4201667 She can get us home. She told us.
4201833 4203375 Wait a minute, you've been inside?
4204167 4205958 - And you made it out alive?<br />- Bullshit.
4206125 4207708 - Nobody's ever done that.<br />- We did.
4207875 4210125 Every time one of us<br />has gone up against her...
4210542 4211375 they die.
4211833 4214542 The Punisher, The Quicksilver, The Daredevil.
4214708 4216042 Daredevil? I'm so sorry.
4216208 4217375 - It's fine.<br />- Okay.
4219667 4222125 Even that sweet, baby angel, Johnny Storm.
4222875 4224417 He up and gone missing like...
4224708 4225708 what, two days ago?
4226417 4228125 Ugh. That's so sad.
4228833 4231583 Wherever this Johnny fella is,<br />I'm sure he's thriving.
4232750 4235833 Look, there's, there's strength in numbers.<br />All right? Us...
4236000 4237375 plus, you guys. We can put Cassandra...
4237542 4239667 over our knee and force her<br />to let us out of The Void.
4239833 4241417 I know what it means to feel self-doubt.
4241583 4243000 - I don't feel that at all.<br />- I'm good.
4243167 4245083 Gnawing at your gut like a coked-up tapeworm.
4245250 4246917 It's like you're<br />holding up a mirror to my soul.
4247083 4249708 You guys may not have been able to<br />save your universes.
4249875 4251333 But you can avenge them.
4252125 4253500 It's what Johnny would have wanted.
4253667 4256333 Wait. You knew Johnny?
4257333 4258500 Oh, yeah.
4258667 4260500 Dickhead here talked him into a team up...
4260667 4263042 and Johnny came down<br />with a little case of the deads.
4263208 4264458 No, no, no. We don't know that.
4264625 4266750 It was just a flesh wound.<br />He may have survived.
4266917 4269500 If he survived that, he is prayin' for death.
4269667 4271958 - Thank you, Doctor Wolverine!<br />- Spill it!
4272125 4273333 What'd you do to Johnny, huh?
4273500 4274708 Talk or I'm gonna start dealin'.
4274875 4276083 Okay. Okay. Hey, hey, hey.
4276750 4277583 Look.
4277750 4280042 He ran his fat-ass mouth about Cassandra.
4280208 4281917 Then she zip-zapped his skin...
4282083 4284125 leaving his organs to<br />splash crudely onto the ground...
4284292 4286833 while the soil greedily drank his blood.<br />It was horrible.
4287000 4288333 He was like a brother to me.
4288958 4291958 Look, he died<br />before he could make a difference. But...
4292125 4294458 Look, maybe you couldn't save your worlds,<br />but...
4294625 4297167 but Jesus Christ, you can save mine!
4297333 4299792 I don't give a shit about your world, but...
4299958 4302875 if these two made it out of there alive,<br />maybe together...
4303042 4304667 we can get back in.<br />And take her down.
4304833 4307375 Where I come from,<br />we call that suicide, <i>Chère.</i>
4307833 4311542 If we can block her psychic powers,<br />we can get a leg up. I know it.
4311708 4313250 Now I know Magneto's dead.
4313792 4315708 But I'd venture to guess that his helmet...
4315875 4318250 - is lying around here somewhere...<br />- Cassandra melted the helmet.
4318417 4319542 - Fuck!<br />- After she killed him.
4319708 4320625 Fuck!
4320792 4321583 She don't play.
4321750 4324667 She knows that helmet was the only way<br />to protect anyone from her powers.
4324833 4327167 The only other helmet that strong is<br />Juggernaut's, but...
4327333 4329417 - he works for Cassandra.<br />- Juggernaut's helmet. That's it.
4329583 4331125 Yeah, and we done be knowing<br />that lid ain't comin' off...
4331292 4333583 - without that dome gonna come off wit'it.<br />- I'm so sorry, beautiful.
4333750 4337083 I want this to be gentle.<br />Who is your dialect coach? The Minions?
4337250 4340083 I feel like<br />we are missing critical exposition here.
4341583 4344292 I'm sick of this shit.<br />I'm sick of hiding.
4345583 4347500 Let's face it, our worlds forgot about us.
4347667 4349292 Or never learned about us.
4349458 4350750 The heroes we were.
4350917 4352042 Lives we saved.
4352208 4353667 Or wanted to save.
4353833 4355500 Maybe these two are our chance.
4357125 4358208 To be remembered.
4358667 4359750 The way we deserve.
4360917 4361875 Yes.
4362042 4362958 An ending.
4363833 4364958 - Legacy.<br />- Yes!
4365125 4366708 Yes! Let this man cook.
4366875 4368125 This is what I'm talking about.
4368292 4370125 Big slow-motion fights, sad music.
4370292 4373250 Everybody working together. Who knows if you<br />live or die? That sorta thing.
4373417 4375417 - Who's ready?<br />- I was born ready.
4375583 4376583 Yes!<br />Gambit?
4376750 4379667 I ain't know my daddy,<br />but I'm sure I shot out of his dick ready.
4379833 4381583 Jesus Christ, that is graphic.
4381750 4383625 Yeah. He was layin' them buttery nuts<br />all up in my mama...
4383792 4385583 and I shot out there and I said,<br />"What's up, Doc?"
4386417 4389625 Johnny must have loved you.<br />X-23, what's it gonna be?
4390500 4391500 The name's Laura.
4391667 4394542 - Let's fucking go.<br />- Let's fucking go!
4394708 4396333 - It's on like chicken and corn.<br />- Yeah!
4396500 4398417 - We're doing this.<br />- You're all fuckin' dead.
4398583 4400625 My God! Read the room.
4411750 4414667 Hey, hey. I'm not lookin' for company.<br />Get out of here.
4416875 4417917 You remind me of him.
4418542 4420000 Angry. Drunk. Mean...
4420375 4422333 - Sounds like a great guy...<br />- Wasn't finished.
4424333 4425833 Showed up when it mattered the most.
4428125 4429708 Couldn't help it.
4433125 4434083 You might not know it, but...
4435542 4436667 you're a good man, Logan.
4439000 4441708 You might not know it, but apparently,<br />I'm the worst Logan.
4443917 4445542 I got to have a life because of you.
4448667 4450083 I got to grow up because of you.
4452333 4453417 A lot of kids did.
4454083 4456000 A lot of kids didn't grow up because of me.
4458250 4459750 Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.
4461167 4462625 That suit says different.
4463292 4464542 Yeah. Do you like it?
4467292 4468917 Scott used to beg me to wear it.
4471250 4473750 So did Jean, Storm, Beast.
4475875 4476875 All of them.
4478167 4481375 They wanted me to be part of the team,<br />but I wouldn't.
4481875 4485000 Told 'em they all look fucking ridiculous.<br />I mean...
4487042 4489500 I couldn't have 'em thinkin'<br />I wanted to be there.
4495333 4498333 And then one day, while I was off on my own,<br />the humans came...
4499208 4500500 and went mutant hunting.
4501833 4502917 I can guess the rest.
4503083 4503917 No, no, let me...
4505625 4506583 Let me say it. I...
4509375 4510333 I need to say it.
4513208 4516333 By the time I stumbled home<br />shitfaced from the bar, it was too late.
4520958 4521958 They were dead. Every...
4528667 4531625 This suit's all I got to remind me of<br />who they were.
4533625 4534500 And what I did.
4547792 4549250 We're headed to Cassandra's at sunup.
4550292 4552083 Have fun. Not my fight.
4555583 4556958 We won't pull this off without you.
4564250 4567375 Hey. Whoever you think I am,<br />you got the wrong guy.
4570333 4571458 You were always the wrong guy.
4597667 4598500 What?
4598667 4600125 Alioth didn't get them.
4601083 4603292 Cassandra wanted to<br />play with them herself first.
4603458 4604292 <i>They got away.</i>
4604458 4606083 - Did they find the others?<br />- No.
4606250 4607458 Good. All right. Phew.
4607625 4608667 <i>The others found them.</i>
4608833 4611458 Oh, very cute. Well done, Pyro.<br />Classic bait and switch.
4611625 4613083 - <i>You really got me there.</i><br />- Relax.
4614042 4616333 If they come after Nova, she'll handle it.
4616500 4618542 Cassandra is a lunatic wild card.
4618708 4620333 Why do you think we put her there<br />in the first place?
4620917 4622875 Thank God she's never chosen<br />to leave The Void.
4623042 4625583 The Time Ripper is hours away<br />from completion.
4625750 4626875 I cannot take any chances.
4627042 4628083 Well, maybe not.
4628250 4629333 <i>But I can.</i>
4629500 4630458 For a price.
4630625 4632083 <i>Why do you have to<br />say it in that silly voice?</i>
4632250 4633333 It's so icky.
4633500 4634333 <i>You want it done or not?</i>
4634500 4635333 All right. Your price.
4635500 4636750 <i>Take her out.</i>
4637417 4638958 Ugh. Mutants.
4661167 4662250 Ooh! Look at that there!
4662417 4665125 You see them biggum hands come closed.<br />Ain't not a wonna gettin' up inside there.
4665292 4666542 I think what Gambit's<br />trying to say is...
4666708 4669417 getting Juggernaut's helmet<br />ain't gonna be easy.
4669583 4671208 I'm just making stuff up at this...
4671375 4673083 - Yeah. Tilt up to Blade.<br />- Gun!
4677833 4679042 Where'd he get that little beauty?
4679500 4681583 That's Punisher's AT4.
4681750 4683750 Which Punisher?<br />There's been like five of them.
4683917 4685208 There's only been one Blade...
4685792 4687708 and there's only ever gonna be one Blade.
4691750 4692917 Incoming!
4759625 4761792 Ooh, this is gonna be good.
4761958 4764208 You know how long I've been waiting for this?
4764375 4766542 Whoo!<br />I'm about to make a name for myself here.
4766708 4768542 I don't think you guys walk away from this.
4768708 4770708 You just make sure<br />people know what happened here today.
4770875 4772833 And when you get out of here,<br />you have a drink for me, yeah?
4773000 4775333 You just stay on our six and get inside.
4775500 4777417 We'll make sure you get the package.
4777917 4779208 And we'll get our ending.
4849333 4850375 And boom!
4882083 4884208 Some motherfuckers still trying<br />to ice skate uphill.
4891250 4893167 You two escaping, I could live with.
4893542 4896208 But coming back? Willingly?
4897833 4899583 Boys are so silly.
4899750 4900875 I just need to get home.
4901042 4903333 Well, that's not on the menu, I'm afraid.
4903500 4906750 It's death or enslavement.<br />À la carte, of course.
4906917 4907917 Upsy-daisy.
4913750 4914625 Finally...
4914792 4916667 it's nice to give someone else<br />a chance to talk.
4916833 4918250 Not my strong suit.
4936542 4937750 You shouldn't have done that.
4961333 4963750 You are an interesting one, aren't you?
4964333 4968292 I do feel like<br />you get lost behind all of his...
4970625 4973125 Deadpools are<br />a dime a dozen here in The Void.
4974083 4975458 But you...
4975958 4978958 What's going on in here?
4992500 4993625 Interesting...
4994792 4996708 Not what I expected back here.
4997792 4999000 Behind the anger.
5003125 5004042 You're hiding.
5004375 5005208 From them.
5006417 5008083 From all the ones you let down.
5010750 5011958 So much pain.
5014542 5015417 I walked away.
5016833 5018375 They called after me and I...
5018542 5020333 I walked away.
5020500 5022125 I always do.
5022292 5024000 - <i>Logan!</i><br />- I know.
5025417 5026708 That's not all you did.
5026875 5028292 Is it?
5031833 5033208 You found them.
5034208 5035208 The X-Men.
5040625 5041625 Dead.
5044375 5045583 Piled like wood.
5047292 5048458 <i>What did you do?</i>
5051167 5052375 I started killing.
5053167 5055667 And I couldn't stop. I didn't wanna stop.
5056958 5059792 <i>All those bad men.</i>
5063542 5065125 It's not just the bad ones.
5066792 5067958 My little animal.
5070833 5073625 And I turned the whole world<br />against the X-Men.
5074000 5075000 Blade!
5080583 5081792 Just once...
5083750 5086292 I wanna be the man<br />that Charles thought I was.
5087500 5088625 Logan...
5090208 5093875 in The Void you can be what you are.
5096292 5097750 I just wanna be free.
5098542 5100000 I can set you free.
5111625 5116750 I can silence all those voices.
5123583 5124583 I've got you.
5127208 5128208 I've got you.
5128958 5129792 No.
5131250 5132292 I got you.
5140958 5142583 Get it off!
5142750 5145875 You're gonna send us home,<br />or I'm gonna twist your fucking head off.
5146042 5147125 Why are you laughing?
5147792 5151583 I can't send you home<br />unless you get this thing off my head.
5152167 5153292 And as soon as you do that...
5153458 5156333 I'm going to boil your brains<br />on an atomic level whilst...
5156500 5159083 flicking my bean to the Enya box set.
5159250 5160292 There's an Enya box set?
5160458 5161708 Either you kill me...
5161875 5163000 or I kill you.
5164083 5165625 Both wonderful options.
5166167 5167000 You want me to do it?
5167458 5168333 No, I'll do it.
5168500 5170542 I have her neck right here.<br />It's really no problem.
5170708 5171417 You'll screw it up.
5171583 5174125 Oh, come on, Mr. PG-13,<br />except the last one!
5175000 5176083 What the fuck?
5178417 5180667 You have no idea what it's like!
5180833 5183750 Day after day. Shovel the shit.
5183917 5185250 Fetch the meats.
5185417 5187375 I have spent my entire...
5190375 5191875 Not everyone gets a speech.
5193833 5194833 She's gonna die.
5195000 5196458 Okay. Hey, hey. If I take this helmet off...
5196625 5198417 - do you promise you won't kill us?<br />- Fuck!
5198583 5199417 I promise...
5199583 5201375 I will kill you first thing.
5201542 5202792 Why are you like this?
5202958 5204208 I wish I knew.
5204375 5205250 Take it off.
5205417 5206292 - What?<br />- Take it off.
5206458 5207292 - Why?<br />- Just take it off.
5207458 5210208 - This is our only chance to fix our shit!<br />- Take it off!
5212125 5213375 I am wearing this suit.
5214583 5216708 And that means a lot of things,<br />but most of all...
5218208 5219333 it means I'm an X-Man.
5220458 5221875 And I know your brother.
5224208 5225708 As much as I want to fucking kill you...
5225875 5228375 every bone in my body<br />wants to fucking kill you...
5228542 5231542 he would not let me stand here<br />and watch you die!
5234000 5235208 Take your hands off.
5236875 5238125 This is for him.
5240042 5241292 This is for Charles.
5251917 5254542 Hey, no, no, no!<br />Don't you dare do me like Johnny!
5260875 5261958 My brother loved you.
5263833 5264917 He loved all of us.
5268000 5269083 Must be nice.
5270208 5271500 He would've loved you, too.
5274375 5275542 If he knew about you...
5277333 5278833 if he knew where you were...
5279000 5282042 he would've torn a hole in the fucking<br />universe to bring you home.
5285875 5286958 This is my home.
5288042 5290292 Well, then at least let us save his.
5294458 5295958 You want to hear something crazy?
5297917 5300792 An amateur magician<br />rolled through here a while back.
5301708 5303167 I killed him, of course.
5303875 5306125 Wore his skin around for four days.
5307167 5308000 But...
5308167 5309583 I found this...
5309750 5311583 little trinket...
5311750 5313875 on his lovely fingers.
5314042 5315208 Strange!
5318292 5320417 - Marvel sparkle circle.<br />- What is that?
5321333 5323250 This is your way home.
5323417 5326875 I do owe you for saving my life.<br />But let's keep things interesting.
5327042 5330333 I'd say you have about four seconds<br />before you're Alioth's food.
5335208 5336042 Race ya.
5419625 5421208 {\an8}And as I said<br />we've got a standard three-year...
5421375 5422667 {\an8}bumper to bumper warranty.
5422833 5424583 Glad you gave us a second chance.
5424750 5428292 And don't worry. Wade and I are a team,<br />so I'll see he gets half the commission...
5430875 5433083 That feels like a Kia.
5433250 5434875 It's a fucking Kia Carnival, isn't it?
5436750 5439583 Holy shit. That's Deadpool.
5439750 5440875 And that's Wolverine.
5441042 5442125 You're damn straight it is.
5442292 5443208 Fox killed him.
5443375 5445917 Disney brought him back. They're going<br />to make him do this 'til he's 90.
5446458 5447417 Let's go.
5448208 5449292 I'll clock you out!
5449667 5450875 Forever!
5451583 5452583 Forever.
5459958 5461167 Wakey-wakey.
5461333 5462333 God?
5464083 5466792 Now you put all these bullets in my belly...
5467500 5469042 and I'm gonna find out why.
5471458 5472833 I'll just say it.
5473542 5475333 You don't have to stick your fingers in me.
5475500 5477750 Jesus, just ask sometimes.
5478125 5479167 Fine.
5480375 5481375 Really?
5482042 5483292 Hands in pockets.
5484833 5486000 Guy named Paradox.
5486917 5488167 He said he'd get me out of The Void.
5488333 5490125 All I know is he works for the TVA.
5490292 5491292 The TVA.
5491458 5492500 We had an agreement.
5492792 5494333 I don't think this guy cares.
5495625 5496667 He will.
5497167 5498208 Hey, people!
5498542 5500667 How much longer<br />before the Time Ripper is active?
5500833 5502667 We're running the final safety checks.
5502833 5504792 Okay. All right.<br />Thanks for all your hard work, Ralph.
5504958 5506333 - Take your time.<br />- Really?
5506500 5508042 No, you drooling boob!
5508208 5509292 No! We have company.
5509458 5512458 Cancel the safety checks.<br />We need to be live now!
5512792 5514250 I hate you so much.
5516458 5517458 No! Stop!
5517625 5519208 Piss off! You're too late.
5519375 5521125 - You're fuckin' done.<br />- Why was Thor crying?
5521292 5522292 How dare you!
5522458 5524625 No one comes back from The Void.
5524792 5526250 Tell that to Cassandra Nova.
5535083 5536875 Paradox.<br />We have a problem.
5539958 5541167 Paradox.
5543500 5545958 Well, you are doughier than<br />you looked in Pyro's head.
5546125 5547292 You tried to kill me.
5547458 5548458 I literally have no...
5549417 5553083 <i>You come for the king,<br />you better kill the king.</i>
5554000 5556375 Welcome to the skull fuck club, Paradox.
5556542 5558667 You know she doesn't wash that hand.
5560417 5561542 What's this?
5562875 5564208 A Time Ripper?
5564375 5566083 - Naughty boy.<br />- Oh, no. We're on it.
5566250 5567875 We're gonna head down<br />and dismantle that thing now.
5568042 5570333 We got ya, boo.<br />You just keep playing those keys.
5570500 5572000 I don't want to destroy it.
5572667 5574000 I want to use it.
5574542 5577042 Now, shoo.<br />Mummy and Daddy are having a conversation.
5583750 5585542 You know, the funny thing is...
5585708 5587167 I was happy in The Void.
5588208 5591125 You sent your trash to me.<br />Alioth and I cleaned it up.
5591292 5593250 Everyone was happy.
5594125 5597208 And then you had to go<br />and piss on my side of the fence.
5597375 5599542 And so now the fence must come down.
5600250 5602083 I'm going to use your little Time Ripper.
5602250 5604833 And I'm going to destroy this universe...
5605000 5607708 and the next and the next and the next...
5607875 5611458 until all that's left is The Void.
5611625 5613500 And I get to play God.
5614042 5615042 Come on.
5615500 5618333 Now you're going to show me how<br />to use this fancy gadget of yours.
5618500 5621875 And don't worry, I've called some friends<br />to make sure we're not disturbed.
5625458 5628000 Sorry to bother, madam,<br />but there's something you need to see.
5628542 5632542 We're getting indications of an unsanctioned<br />Time Ripper activating on Earth-10005.
5634833 5636042 Whose district is that?
5636417 5637333 Paradox.
5649375 5651583 Well, thank you so much<br />for your help, darling.
5651750 5654167 God. Good to get out of that head.
5654333 5655833 What a mess!
5663167 5664000 Stop!
5664500 5666500 Let's give it a beat for the extras to clear.
5666667 5668708 Go, go, go!<br />Oh, my God!
5673500 5676167 - Oh. My. God.<br />- Fuck.
5683917 5685292 It's her!
5686542 5687667 Come on, girl!
5695083 5696292 Come on, girl!
5711042 5712167 That's my girl!
5712333 5715625 We don't have to be apart ever, ever again.<br />Never, ever...
5715792 5716875 - Sorry!<br />- Fuck!
5718000 5719792 What's Café Gratitude doing here?
5719958 5721208 Sorry about that.
5721375 5724708 Tremble not, sweet Mary Puppins.<br />I'll handle him.
5725333 5726375 Come here, girl.<br />Papa's here.
5726542 5728958 Hey, do not insult<br />this animal's autonomy.
5729667 5731708 She can decide who her papa is.
5731875 5732917 What's it gonna be, girl, huh?
5733083 5735583 Original recipe or Van Milder here?
5736208 5739083 That's funny.<br />I can gently tap the fourth wall too.
5739583 5740750 <i>The Proposal.</i>
5742500 5743500 The fuck was that?
5743667 5745833 - Bitch, you think that's what I do?<br />- Both of you shut up.
5747333 5748333 You smell somethin'?
5748500 5749333 Yeah, you.
5750208 5751792 A lot of you.
5766958 5769208 Told you there were<br />a lot of Deadpools over there.
5780750 5781917 That's bad.
5804417 5805583 I take it they're not friendly.
5805750 5806625 Goodness, no.
5806792 5808833 Sorry about this, boys.<br />Mission over.
5809000 5811667 Cause of death,<br />one hundred kill-thirsty Deadpools.
5811833 5812917 They're dumb.
5813083 5814833 But they can fight.<br />Not me, though.
5815000 5817208 Would love to get in the mix<br />but I have low bone density...
5817375 5818875 and I have to keep my face safe.
5819833 5820833 - Hold, please.<br />- Oh, God.
5821000 5822208 All right. Look.
5822875 5823875 Guys!
5825083 5826833 Deadpool Prime here.
5827000 5828458 - Our fight isn't with you...<br />- Hey!
5828625 5832250 When I want your opinion,<br />I'll take Wolverine's dick out of your mouth.
5832417 5834000 That's Kidpool.<br />She's the dirtiest.
5834167 5835417 Can we just be done?
5835583 5837125 We're just getting started.
5837292 5840583 No, no, no. With the whole multiverse thing.
5841500 5842500 It's not great.
5842667 5844125 It's just been miss...
5844583 5846083 after miss...
5846250 5847958 after miss.
5848333 5850667 Look, <i>The Wizard of Oz</i><br />did the multiverse first...
5850833 5853125 and they did it best.<br />The gays knew it.
5853583 5854833 But we didn't listen.
5855000 5857750 Let's just take the L and move on.
5857917 5860250 I think it's been steadily great<br />since <i>Endgame.</i>
5860417 5861875 What are you talking about?
5862042 5863500 The multiverse is over.
5863667 5866542 Cassandy gonna destroy<br />the fuck outta every timeline.
5866708 5869000 - Y'all can't do shit about it.<br />- Do you not get it?
5869167 5871375 If we don't go down to the subway<br />and stop her, we all die.
5871542 5873792 Say, the boss lady don't want<br />no disturbances.
5873958 5876667 You wanna get down to the subway,<br />you gotta go through us.
5876833 5877792 Uzi time, baby.
5878083 5879083 Uzi time, baby.
5879250 5880250 Look alive!
5889708 5891375 - I think I'm hit.<br />- No shit.
5891542 5892458 You did that on purpose.
5892625 5894167 I did no such thing!
5894333 5895333 Listen to me, gorgeous.
5895500 5896750 How long does it take for you to regenerate?
5896917 5898167 Regenerate?
5904375 5906167 You really are God's perfect idiot,<br />aren't you?
5906333 5907708 - I'm okay.<br />- How dare you!
5907875 5909792 You insensitive son of a bitch!
5909958 5911875 How was I supposed to know<br />he doesn't regenerate?
5912042 5913167 I'm not a medicine woman.
5913625 5914875 Look. A donut cart.
5915042 5916125 - They're practically hospitals.<br />- What?
5916292 5918125 - They sell portable triage units.<br />- They don't.
5918292 5919833 - I'm gonna get you to safety.<br />- He's not.
5920000 5921167 Deep breath.
5929542 5931542 Hey, why are we stopping?
5931708 5932917 I'm just catching my breath.
5933083 5935667 What, are your legs on vacation?<br />You're dead weight!
5935833 5937417 That's because I'm paralyzed.
5937583 5939583 We all have problems.<br />Listen to me.
5939750 5940750 You're gonna live.
5941875 5943125 Look at me, Nicepool.
5947083 5948250 You're gonna live.
5948958 5950208 Say it!
5950750 5952083 I'm gonna live.
5952375 5954417 Say it with me.<br />You're gonna live.
5954583 5956750 I'm gonna live!
5958083 5960125 Say it louder!
5960292 5961458 I'm gonna live...
5970375 5971375 Hold your fire!
5973708 5975000 Sweet little puppy.
5985833 5988292 God damn it!<br />I don't think he's gonna make it.
5988458 5990542 God, he loved his face.
5990708 5993083 I can taste his final thought.
5993250 5994792 He was so afraid.
5994958 5995917 But he died a hero.
5996083 5998000 He died from murder, you dumb fuck.
5998167 5999958 And all I have to remember him by...
6000875 6004542 are these two gold-plated,<br />...50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros.
6005000 6005958 This is for him.
6006583 6007750 Are you ready?
6008333 6010083 I get to kill a hundred yous?
6010250 6011458 Fuck yeah, I'm ready.
6012542 6013833 Hey, you don't want to see this, bub.
6014000 6015292 That's a good girl.
6052208 6053583 Holy shit.
6053750 6055833 You save the good stuff<br />for special occasions?
6056000 6057250 Killing mostly.
6057417 6059750 What's the wind resistance<br />on those blowjob handles?
6061042 6064292 I'm sorry.<br />I'm just a catty bitch when I'm jealous.
6064458 6065708 All right, let's do this.
6066083 6067292 Maximum effort.
6106958 6108042 You're dead.
6133917 6135167 Motherfucker.
6136083 6137708 I wish I were deaf.
6157542 6159375 I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die.
6159542 6160583 I don't wanna...
6174250 6175417 Come on.
6175583 6176583 I blew it.
6176750 6178792 After all that, the only thing<br />they're gonna remember...
6178958 6180667 is that God awful dismount!
6185500 6187000 What you laughing at,<br />you little fucker?
6187333 6188458 Uh-oh.
6188625 6189667 Uh-oh.
6193875 6195458 I guess these ones regenerate.
6197583 6199958 Come on. We don't have time for this.
6200125 6201167 Deadpools!
6201333 6202417 Stand down.
6212917 6214417 This Deadpool's with me.
6214583 6215792 Oh, no.
6215958 6217167 Holy shit.
6217333 6218542 That's fuckin' Peter!
6221750 6223583 Wait, you...<br />You guys know Peter?
6223750 6225875 You kidding me? Every Deadpool has a Peter.
6226042 6229625 Shit. Peter's a goddamn legend<br />in every Deadpool's world.
6229792 6230875 Peter<i>-san.</i>
6239250 6241333 Peter. Peter. Peter.
6247375 6248917 Enjoy my Peter.
6276458 6278917 Oh, now you're here.<br />Oh, well, you're too late. It's all over.
6279083 6279917 Not yet, it's not.
6280083 6281750 Whoa. No, no, no. We're very close.
6281917 6283250 Homestretch, folks. Promise.
6283417 6284917 Quick, let's up the stakes.
6285083 6286417 If she steals the Time Ripper's energy...
6286583 6289042 she has the power to<br />shred the fabric of all realities...
6289208 6290833 until there is nothing left but The Void.
6291000 6291958 How do we shut it down?
6292375 6293292 I don't know.
6295042 6296125 How about now?
6296292 6297625 The mask is really intimidating, huh?
6297792 6299792 It's like Batman,<br />except he can move his neck.
6299958 6301375 Okay, look, look, look.
6302833 6305208 The Ripper is fed from<br />a secure chamber below ground.
6305375 6309500 It is powered by twin matter and anti-matter<br />feeds converging inside the device.
6309667 6310792 <i>Now, Cassandra Nova...</i>
6310958 6313125 <i>is redirecting the Ripper's power<br />to eliminate all timelines...</i>
6313292 6314292 starting with this one.
6314458 6315792 Theoretically, you could stop her...
6315958 6317792 by short-circuiting the feeds<br />in the chamber below.
6317958 6320333 One of you were to create a<br />circuit between the two feeds...
6320500 6323708 then the released power<br />would destroy the machine.
6323875 6325667 - But, well, but...<br />- Come on, man.
6325833 6327833 If you're not gonna swallow, spit it out.
6328000 6331042 Whoever formed the bridge<br />would be annihilated.
6331208 6332833 - I could live with that.<br />- Yeah, I could live with that, too, actually.
6333000 6334708 You know, we survive anything.<br />We're like cockroaches.
6334875 6335792 Not this time.
6335958 6338625 This is matter and anti-matter.
6338792 6340708 They do not play nicely with each other.
6340875 6343625 When they mix in your body<br />you will be atomized.
6344208 6346208 Trust the laws of physics<br />if you don't trust me.
6346375 6348417 Even if you lived long enough to<br />make the circuit...
6348583 6351125 you will die down there.
6376458 6377792 Hold off. Hold.
6377958 6379458 You heard that asshole upstairs.
6379625 6383667 Even if we pull this off,<br />we're dead. Permanently.
6384292 6385333 That's why it's got to be me.
6385500 6386333 What?
6390250 6391083 Look, man...
6392333 6394083 you didn't ask for any of this.
6394542 6395667 You were right.
6396000 6396917 I lied.
6397875 6399583 I lied right to your face...
6399750 6401625 just to get you to help me. And you did.
6402542 6404000 You didn't lie.
6406000 6407375 You made an educated wish.
6410458 6411292 Come on.
6412708 6414458 You got a whole world to go back to.
6416125 6416958 I got nothin'.
6419292 6420125 I got nothin'.
6425375 6426208 Give me this.
6433375 6434583 Hey.
6439083 6440917 I waited a long time for this team up.
6443208 6444167 You know something?
6446208 6447708 You were the best Wolverine.
6456583 6458375 Say hi to your friends for me.
6470458 6471542 No!
6471708 6472667 Open the door!
6472833 6475458 I can't hear you over all the<br />noble sacrifice.
6475625 6476750 Why are you fucking doing this?
6476917 6480042 Because I'm Marvel Jesus.
6481750 6482750 Or Spock.
6484000 6485000 Hard to say.
6489625 6490458 Wade!
6491208 6493167 You fucking idiot!
6498333 6499458 Sorry, I'm just stalling.
6499625 6501917 I think I'm nervous about dying.
6502750 6503875 This should be me.
6504583 6506250 Say hi to my friends for me, peanut.
6506417 6507417 Wade!
6507583 6509625 You want to be an annoying prick,<br />do it this side!
6509792 6511833 You're gonna die in there,<br />you dumb fuck!
6518833 6520500 Hey! You don't need to do this.
6520917 6522542 I'm not doing it 'cause I need it.
6523583 6525583 I'm doing it because they do.
6536542 6537792 No!
6567125 6568625 He's not gonna make it.
6577333 6578417 It's over.
6645875 6647208 <i>The Wolverine.</i>
6648292 6650083 <i>He's a hero in my world.</i>
6652375 6654875 <i>Whoever you think I am,<br />you got the wrong guy.</i>
6656417 6658167 <i>You were always the wrong guy...</i>
6659708 6661333 <i>till you weren't.</i>
6663375 6664875 <i>Wade.</i>
6666792 6671375 <i>Wade. You can finally, finally, matter.</i>
6687417 6688417 Vanessa.
6690875 6692708 <i>I wanna see Vanessa.</i>
6699000 6703208 For the first time in my life,<br />I am proud to wear this suit.
6704417 6706083 <i>It means I'm an X-Man.</i>
6708583 6710167 I am the X-Man.
6754208 6755750 Paradox.
6757583 6758750 You've been busy.
6759167 6760208 Well, somebody had to be.
6760375 6762333 We had some<br />strange readings from this location.
6762500 6765292 You wouldn't know anything about an<br />unsanctioned Time Ripper, would you?
6766333 6769458 No. No. I wouldn't know anything about an<br />unsanctioned Time Ripper.
6769625 6771125 Maybe you should ask Cassandra Nova.
6771292 6772208 Because I was assured...
6772375 6774875 that she was safely held in The Void.<br />But no...
6775042 6777083 she was here.<br />And she fondled my brain.
6777250 6778167 How did you let this happen?
6778333 6779208 You weren't involved at all?
6779375 6781875 In stopping her, yes!<br />Yes. I was.
6782042 6783583 But, not nearly enough.
6783750 6785958 Not as much as the men<br />who went down there after her.
6786625 6787708 My men.
6788458 6789458 My friends.
6790875 6791833 I warned them.
6792000 6795167 That they would be completely obliterated<br />if they went. But they went anyway. Like...
6796958 6798042 Like heroes.
6800167 6801833 Because that's who they were.
6804708 6806125 They just did what they had to do.
6807542 6809125 With no concern for their own safety.
6812375 6818958 The fact that we are all still standing here<br />is a testament to their heroism.
6822667 6825042 Anyway, there's nothing you or I can do<br />to bring them back now.
6826875 6828875 He has risen, baby girl.
6829042 6829833 Fuck!
6849333 6850542 Found your new Anchor Being.
6851042 6853000 And we're doing just fine, you piece of shit.
6853417 6854500 Mm. Mm-hmm.
6854875 6856333 Fine indeed.
6856500 6860500 All right. Put your greasy tits away,<br />you preening slut.
6861375 6862750 I don't understand.
6862917 6864083 How are you two still alive?
6864250 6866333 You were right.<br />One of us would have been killed.
6866500 6869458 But you put<br />a Deadpool and a Wolverine together...
6869625 6871708 make 'em hold hands<br />while listening to Madonna...
6871875 6873958 indestructible, motherfucker.
6874458 6876667 Let's get this Deadpool Variant<br />back to The Void.
6876833 6878667 - Wait, hold on. What?<br />- Nope. Actually...
6878833 6880375 This one's homegrown, like me.
6880542 6881625 He belongs here.
6882083 6883000 And you are?
6883167 6885708 Peterpool. But you can call me Peter.
6887333 6888375 And I hope that you do.
6894875 6896292 What the fuck is happening here?
6896458 6898125 You are under judgment...
6898292 6900167 for operating an unsanctioned Time Ripper.
6900333 6901417 - Take him.<br />- I was just doing what...
6901583 6902958 you don't have the guts to do.
6903750 6905958 Get your insolent hands off me!
6906125 6906958 Get off!
6908208 6909875 I'm grateful, gentlemen.
6910708 6911792 Let's hold the bows.
6911958 6914375 You led an<br />Omega-level mutant to this timeline.
6914542 6916125 - You're welcome.<br />- And you...
6916292 6918167 - shouldn't even be near this timeline.<br />- He's welcome.
6918458 6921708 And you look damn good in that suit.
6921875 6922875 I'm so sorry.
6927375 6931000 I wanna show you something.<br />Something huge.
6931167 6933083 That's what Scoutmaster Kevin used to say.
6934708 6935708 Do you see that?
6936458 6938208 Your universe is regenerating.
6939125 6940458 Whatever you did here...
6940875 6942750 you not only saved your world.
6943292 6945667 You spared your timeline from extinction.
6947500 6948583 I'd rest up.
6948958 6951333 I have a feeling your work<br />is only just getting started.
6951500 6953042 Till you're 90.
6953208 6954042 Wait!
6955500 6958208 We couldn't have made it out of The Void<br />without some help...
6959042 6962917 from some people that the world<br />kind of forgot.
6963417 6966792 Is there any way that you could maybe find<br />a way to bring them home?
6968875 6969958 I'll see what I can do.
6970708 6972583 And I promised my friend here...
6973000 6976542 that the TVA could undo some<br />pretty awful shit in his timeline.
6976708 6977667 What would you say to that?
6978000 6979042 Change the past?
6979667 6981625 Well, he did help me save the world.
6981958 6984292 And his past made him the man who did it.
6985375 6987625 There's nothing to fix, Mr. Wilson.
6989083 6990125 Logan.
6993625 6994417 Shawarma?
6994583 6995417 - I could eat.<br />- Yeah.
7005250 7007542 You know, the Avengers discovered shawarma.
7008542 7010167 They'd be lucky to have you.
7017542 7019542 - Oh.<br />- Oh, come on.
7019708 7020750 Fuck off!
7021917 7026625 Come here, my little cunchkin.<br />Yes, it's you. You're a survivor.
7028042 7029833 Oh, all is right in the world.
7031125 7032125 Yes, it is.
7033917 7035083 So what are you gonna do next?
7036708 7038708 I'll figure it out. I always do.
7039583 7040417 All right.
7041750 7043000 So I'll probably see you around?
7048042 7048875 Probably not.
7052375 7053208 See you, bub.
7062958 7063958 Logan.
7070542 7072208 Al. I'm back.
7072792 7074042 About damn time.
7074417 7075250 You holdin'?
7075417 7077167 I'm all outta devil's dandruff...
7077333 7080042 - and I'm shaking like an angry vibrator.<br />- Thank you, Al.
7080208 7081083 We have company.
7081958 7083458 Althea, this is...
7084208 7085250 This is Logan.
7085417 7086458 Nice to meet you, Logan.
7086625 7087458 Nice to meet you, too.
7087625 7091167 And this little ancient anal shit-knot is<br />Mary Puppins.
7091333 7093625 Or as I like to call her, Dogpool.
7093792 7095458 You want to treat yourself<br />to a little stroke?
7097125 7100167 - Get the tongue. There it is.<br />- Oh, my God! Motherfucker!
7100333 7104042 Right? It's like an armadillo<br />fucked a gremlin, angrily...
7104208 7105500 in a bed of gonorrhea...
7105667 7108042 - Wow.<br />- ...and didn't stop till the sun came up.
7109333 7110917 <i>Everyone wants to matter.</i>
7111833 7114458 <i>Turns out that<br />you don't need to be Marvel Jesus to do it.</i>
7115292 7117542 <i>You just need to<br />open your eyes and look around.</i>
7118250 7119250 <i>And if you're lucky...</i>
7120250 7121667 <i>you'll find a few friends.</i>
7122125 7123250 <i>Old friends...</i>
7124250 7125958 <i>and some new ones too.</i>
7130667 7132625 Give me the fucking dog. Talk to the girl.
7143083 7144208 Well, hi.
7144375 7145208 Hi.
7148042 7149042 You've been busy.
7152125 7153625 I did it for you.
7155667 7157958 And even if you don't want me,<br />I did it for you.
7167375 7168375 <i>It turns out...</i>
7169083 7170458 <i>I am the world-saving type.</i>
7171417 7173417 <i>Just look around this table<br />if you want proof.</i>
7174417 7175375 <i>And the best part?</i>
7176333 7178083 <i>Sometimes the people we save...</i>
7179125 7181292 <i>well, they save us right back.</i>
7220750 7222875 <i>You're not the only one with gifts.</i>
7223042 7224208 What is this place?
7253208 7254042 Nice suit.
7254208 7255083 Zip it, Stan Lee.
7264000 7266542 {\an8}I really like the,<br />the art in the Deadpool comics.
7266708 7268958 <i>You know, I just always felt a<br />kind of a kinship to him.</i>
7269125 7271833 And I just thought,<br />I'd like to play that guy someday.
7300625 7303125 I was there for three weeks<br />before I shot a single thing.
7303542 7305083 {\an8}At our first day of shooting...
7305625 7307125 <i>I was so nervous, man.</i>
7307708 7309792 Everyone was sort of going,<br />"Who's this guy?"
7309958 7311792 <i>You know, there was a lot of that and...</i>
7311958 7315417 you know, "Is he gonna deliver or not?"<br />You can feel all that kind of pressure.
7316750 7320000 It's always the suit's fault.<br />Never the actor.
7328792 7330167 - This is...<br />- The only way.
7339583 7341500 So this is what it feels like.
7344042 7345667 And there's the lights.
7345833 7347083 For medical research.
7347708 7349625 - Bye-bye, video.<br />- Bye.
7603417 7607292 I'm tired of these absolutely vile rumors<br />that I got Johnny killed.
7608375 7609417 Let's look at the tape.
7610625 7611833 <i>In The Void...</i>
7612000 7613792 <i>you're either food for Alioth...</i>
7613958 7615083 or you work for her.
7618250 7619167 Go on, Johnny.
7619708 7620833 And I'll tell you who "her" is.
7621333 7622208 Cassandra Nova.
7622375 7624542 A megalomaniacal, psychotic asshole.
7624708 7628417 A finger licking dead-inside pixie slab of<br />third rate dime-store nut-milk.
7628583 7630125 - And I'll tell you what she can do.<br />- I'm listening.
7630292 7633833 She can lick my goddamn cinnamon ring clean<br />and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.
7634000 7636208 In fact, I don't give a shit if she removes<br />all my skin and...
7636375 7638250 pops me like some nightmarish blood balloon.
7638417 7641375 If the last thing I do in this godforsaken<br />cum-gutter existence...
7641542 7644292 is light that fuck-box on fire,<br />I still won't die happy.
7644458 7646208 Holy shit, girl. You crazy.
7646375 7648000 That's right, Wade.<br />I won't be happy until...
7648167 7651917 I've urinated on her freshly barbecued corpse<br />and husk-fucked the charred remains...
7652083 7653833 while gargling Juggernaut's juggernuts.
7654000 7655375 - Wow!<br />- And you can quote me.
7655542 7656375 'Kay.
7657125 7658417 Got you, fuckface.
