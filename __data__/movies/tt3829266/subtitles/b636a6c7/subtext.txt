152252 153686 Do you got eyes on the hostages?
153953 155355 Still negative.
155855 157790 DUPREE (on radio): 20 bucks says they don't show.
158091 159759 You two morons really making bets
159792 162595 on whether a drug cartel has executed these hostages?
162629 163329 DUPREE: Abso-fucking-lutely.
163763 164964 HAINES: I believe that was implied. Yeah.
164998 166799 Just checking. I'm in for 20.
185418 186886 (indistinct chatter)

322055 323856 Don't know. Comm's not fucking working.
324824 325992 Give me the pack.
331698 332832 It's evidence.
332865 334767 Ain't nobody gonna believe this one.
340106 341674 The fuck is that, Cap?
343643 345078 It's above our pay grade.
346446 348548 -(radio beeps) -Haines! Come in. Over.
348981 350049 (grunts)

497964 498965 Go!
499165 500800 SOLDIER: Eyes up! Come on!
501334 503302 I want the passenger. I want the pod.
503336 504270 If it's not from here...
504303 505671 -You want it. -...I want it.

517750 518784 (clears throat)
524223 525291 (speaks Spanish)

551350 552351 (gasps)
558057 560393 I need you to mail this for me.
560426 562361 You send it to this address.
562662 565731 Mail what's in the pack, not the backpack.
566132 567199 Ahora. Go!
571671 574006 (sirens blaring in distance)

591824 592825 Bye, Mom!
616849 618084 (exclaims)
620853 623222 -(laughs) Do it, man. -No, you do it.
623255 624290 Okay.

648114 649782 Hey, EJ, you hungry?
649815 652184 I'm hungry for an ass-burger.
652218 653719 Mmm. Sounds delicious.
653986 656122 A nice, big, juicy ass-burger.
656155 658224 -EJ: Oh, yeah. -(whimpering)
660192 661761 The hell are you doing?
663095 664997 -DEREK: He's a goner. -All right.

725257 726392 (door closes)

743909 744944 Hi, there.
745211 747279 Does, uh, Quinn McKenna live here?
747747 750483 His post office box payments are past due.
752318 753552 Department of Defense.
754186 756021 He works for the government, does he?
756856 759458 MOS-1-1-B-3-V-W-3.
760426 761927 Military designation.
762261 764430 -Ah. -He kills people...
766065 767366 so you can be a mailman.
781080 782148 Dr. Brackett?
789321 792191 I understand you enjoy stargazing?
795027 796428 My men will take care of your dog.
796462 797596 Will you come with me, please?
809375 810409 What am I looking at?
812144 814246 It's exactly what you think it is. Yeah.
816649 818450 They've been here before.
818484 820619 '87. '97.
823022 826425 Lately, the visits are increasing in frequency.
837236 840306 EMILY: Rory, I'm home! Hey, I got you something.
841473 842474 Hey.
846078 848080 Did you do one of these after school?
848380 849582 I did all of them.
850416 852084 Oh. Okay.
852651 856055 Well, I got you two options.
857223 858324 We have...
859191 861160 pirate, or...
863529 864563 Frankenstein.
867166 868968 Frankenstein, you know, green skin?
869468 871303 Threw a girl to see if she would float?
873405 874506 No. Okay.
874540 876909 Well, let's go with pirate. Yeah?
877409 878444 This is dumb.
880012 881513 The guys will...
882481 884049 They will still be able to see.
885351 886385 See what?
887353 888387 That it's me.
891056 893125 PSYCHOLOGIST: You were once quoted as saying,
893325 895194 "I dropped from my mother's womb...
895427 897196 I hit the floor...
897563 899031 and I started crawling
899064 901433 through hostile territory toward my grave."
901467 903335 (laughing)
903602 904670 QUINN: About right, yeah.
904703 906739 -That's badass. -It's pretty morbid.
906772 908040 It's pretty dark.
908707 911477 What's with the polygraph?
911510 912945 I thought this was a psych eval.
913245 915314 We need to know if you pose a threat.
915347 916482 Oh, I'm a sniper.
917149 919418 Isn't posing a threat kind of the fucking point?
920085 923322 You spend most of your time now in-country...
923656 925624 estranged from your wife and son?
929061 930296 (sighs)
931597 933098 Look, I get it.
933699 937069 Something went down in Mexico and nobody wants any witnesses.
937102 938037 Excuse me?
938337 940572 You're not here to find out if I'm crazy.
941073 943375 You wanna make sure the label sticks.
943409 944977 So, you feel you're being railroaded?
945210 947413 I can see the tracks on the floor!
949148 950749 I don't see tracks on the floor, for the record.
951016 952718 You feel like you're a stranger
952751 954286 on your own planet, don't you, Captain?
956055 958157 Like an alien, you mean?
961460 963095 That's what you wanted.
965431 966732 Do I get a cookie now?
967533 968667 He saw something.
968701 970002 -Oh, yeah. -Yeah.
1015481 1016782 Wow!
1029528 1030596 Ow.
1038904 1040139 (beeps)
1050783 1053552 (device trilling)
1058757 1060392 (exhales deeply)
1061693 1063829 You shove me again, I'm gonna break your neck.
1064696 1066165 Did I say that out loud?
1070502 1072137 -(Quinn clears throat) -McKenna.
1074840 1076141 OFFICER: Last one.
1076175 1077576 Thanks for your kindness. Thank you.
1083415 1084550 (sighs)
1086785 1088153 (keys jangling)
1095427 1096428 Oh, yeah?
1099264 1100299 (Baxley mumbles)
1101433 1102901 (clicks and sniffs)
1103836 1104870 You all right over there?
1104903 1106905 No, don't worry about him. He's just got Tourettes.
1106939 1108907 -He can't control it. -Fuck you, Coyle.
1108941 1110476 You get used to it, bro.
1115747 1117449 Welcome to Group Two.
1117483 1118817 Oh, yeah? What's that?
1118851 1119952 Like a unit?
1119985 1121687 No, group. Group Two.
1121920 1123655 Group therapy, room two.
1124823 1126191 Oh.
1126225 1127759 -McKenna. -Nebraska Williams.
1127793 1128894 That's your real name?
1128927 1129761 Gaylord.
1129995 1132164 -That's a good call, then. -Yeah, I thought so.
1132364 1133599 (chuckles)
1133632 1134867 Where did you serve?
1135334 1137469 Operation Enduring Freedom, '03.
1138003 1140739 Went for the Taliban, stayed for the opium.
1141707 1142808 (laughing)
1144810 1147246 That's Coyle. Friendly fire incident.
1147546 1150215 Got turned around, fired at one of his own vehicles.
1151383 1152584 Now, he tells jokes.
1152618 1153719 (Coyle clears throat)
1153752 1155854 -(thuds) -(grunts) That's Lynch.
1156221 1158490 Got a medal for blowing up half a mountain in Mosul.
1158991 1160392 Entropy.
1161026 1162427 That's my game.
1162861 1164630 Things like to fall apart
1164663 1166698 and I... make it happen.
1167866 1169701 Just... Just like that.
1169735 1171937 -(gasping) -Ooh! Wow! Oh.
1173038 1174840 -Hey. -Hey. Don't.
1176842 1177843 Don't.
1178110 1179444 That's Nettles.
1179711 1181780 (stutters) Okay, I'm Nettles.
1182080 1183882 Did three tours flying Hueys.
1183916 1186318 He loves his Bible. Hey, Netty?
1186351 1187853 Is it end times yet?
1187886 1189087 Yeah, laugh all you want.
1189121 1191490 But when you're standing at attention before your Maker...
1191523 1193525 I always stand at attention before I make her.
1193559 1195327 -(whistles) -(laughter)
1195360 1196795 God makes shitty people.
1197529 1198597 Yeah.
1198630 1200832 I mean, why do you think people make war?
1200866 1202434 Why, Baxley? Why do we make war?
1202467 1204770 -Come on, Baxley! -Because fuck-cock-cock!
1204803 1206772 -Because we fuck cock-cock? -Yes, we fuck cocks.
1206805 1208006 That's it, because we fuck cocks,
1208040 1209474 that's why. We get upset.
1209775 1211944 How'd you snag a ticket on this shitmobile?
1212477 1214279 Put a bullet in a CO.
1215314 1216682 Any particular reason?
1218483 1219651 He was an asshole.
1242774 1244009 Keep your head down.
1252584 1253719 Here, throw this on.
1258690 1259925 (bell rings)
1262027 1263829 Is it just your imagination?
1264162 1267432 Or is this haunted room actually stretching?
1268900 1270068 Every fucking time?
1271103 1272504 (elevator dings)
1272838 1274673 AUTOMATED VOICE: Your attention, please.
1274706 1278377 The GRC meeting has been moved to section 3, room A.
1278410 1280479 Aha! There you are!
1281747 1284349 Welcome. I'm Sean Keyes.
1284883 1286852 Wow. I heard you basically wrote the book
1286885 1288420 on evolutionary biology.
1288453 1289988 Um, I'm sorry, can I just...
1290222 1291490 Is that...?
1294126 1295694 Oh, my God!
1297162 1299731 (chuckles nervously) Holy shit.
1300132 1301767 That's alien technology.
1304036 1305737 This is what you brought me here to see?
1306538 1308040 KEYES: Well, yeah.
1308674 1311510 Can I... Can I see this? Can I get into this?
1311810 1312811 Doc.
1313612 1314780 Let's go.
1314813 1316882 (indistinct PA announcement)
1327592 1329361 -TRAEGER: Everything good? -Yes, sir.
1330529 1331697 TRAEGER: What is it?
1333699 1334766 Dr. Brackett.
1335267 1337035 Would you like to meet a Predator?
1337836 1339137 (chuckles) Come on.
1347779 1349081 WOMAN (on PA): Please observe
1349114 1350949 decontamination protocol.
1351516 1353652 KEYES: So, how'd they rope you into this?
1353952 1356121 I wrote a letter to the president when I was six.
1356154 1357656 Told him how much I loved animals,
1357689 1359124 and that if NASA ever found a space animal,
1359358 1360726 they should call me.
1361093 1363795 Couple years ago, I was put on a short list
1363829 1365630 for a paper I wrote on hybrid strains.
1365864 1369167 Computer cross-referenced the letter, and... here I am.
1370936 1372471 (machine whirring)
1376975 1378110 Dr. Brackett.
1379177 1380746 Thanks for coming.
1380779 1382013 I'm sure you have questions.
1382280 1384883 -Oh. Just two, actually. -Okay.
1385283 1386852 Why do you call it "the Predator"?
1387686 1389054 It's a nickname.
1389688 1392657 You know, the data suggests that it tracks its prey.
1392858 1394126 Exploits weakness.
1394359 1395894 Seems to...
1396561 1397629 well, enjoy it.
1397863 1399131 Like a game.
1399164 1401166 That's not a predator, that's a sports hunter.
1401199 1402467 Sorry?
1402501 1404703 A predator kills its prey to survive.
1404736 1408607 I mean, what you're describing is more like a bass fisherman.
1408640 1410609 Well, we took a vote. Predator's cooler, right?
1410642 1412544 -SAPIR: Fuck yeah. -Fuck yeah.
1412778 1414679 Found his escape pod in Mexico.
1414713 1416448 Still looking for the ship he came in.
1417149 1418683 He's heavily sedated.
1424556 1426758 You are one beautiful motherfucker.
1427592 1430595 I'm gonna guess your second question is, why are you here?
1432798 1435867 Our test results yielded something a little... odd.
1437736 1439171 (scoffs) Is this a joke?
1439704 1442073 KEYES: We ran the genome sequence ten times.
1442107 1444009 This specimen has...
1444042 1445777 -Human DNA? -Yeah.
1445811 1446611 Yeah.
1446845 1449781 Look, we know about spontaneous speciation.
1449815 1451249 Mostly plants and insects, but...
1451283 1454019 But some mammals, sheep, goats, uh...
1454052 1454753 Yeah.
1455053 1456788 KEYES: The red wolf is known to be a hybrid
1456822 1457856 between the coyote and the grey wolf...
1457889 1460559 Or possibly some form of recombinant technology...
1460592 1462828 Guys, guys, guys. I get it, I get it.
1463462 1465497 You wanna know if someone fucked an alien?
1467799 1468834 Yeah.
1471203 1473738 Okay, it's got some kind of atmospheric mask,
1473772 1474473 biohelmet, and...
1474940 1477042 What are these? Like, some kind of wrist gauntlets?
1477075 1478109 Exactly.
1478677 1480979 So, where's the helmet and the other gauntlet?
1481012 1482013 We've looked, believe me.
1484749 1485784 Who is this?
1486585 1488587 He made first contact with the Predator.
1488787 1490255 Great. I'd like to talk to him.
1490755 1493692 Well, he's being evaluated, so...
1496995 1498063 Okay.

2511375 2513177 -He said... pushy. -What the fuck?
2513210 2514912 Which is also fucking rude.
2514945 2516347 He doesn't mean your pussy in particular.
2516380 2517915 You're insane, right?
2517948 2519250 -Are you fucking insane? -COYLE: Probably.
2519283 2520084 Well, what's it gonna be?
2520518 2522052 -BAXLEY: He's fucking crazy. -NETTLES: Fuck you, Baxley.
2522086 2523120 BAXLEY: I feel fine.
2523621 2524955 CASEY: They were gonna shoot me?
2525656 2526657 Why?
2527091 2530661 Uh, maybe 'cause of this?
2535666 2536934 Well, I guess I'm in.
2538235 2539870 Stay the fuck away from me.
2543274 2544642 What the fuck is this?
2545743 2547044 What is this?
2547077 2549613 -What is that? Like a unicorn? -NETTLES: A unicorn.
2549647 2550915 -It's a unicorn. -A unicorn.
2551148 2552816 I made a unicorn...
2552850 2554618 I'm sorry, it's a piece of shit.
2554652 2557288 So, what's the upside to me staying here with you guys?
2557321 2559089 Uh, maybe staying alive?
2559123 2560391 We are soldiers.
2560424 2561825 We're the good guys, okay?
2561859 2563160 CASEY: Well, that's debatable.
2563193 2567231 I read your file. The guys in Mexico it killed?
2567264 2568299 They yours?
2568732 2570301 They're gonna need a patsy for that.
2570334 2571669 You're looking at him.
2571869 2572836 Yeah, I figured.
2573070 2575706 Ex-sniper with PTSD? That's actually kind of perfect.
2575739 2576941 How about you telling us
2577174 2578976 what you were doing in a secret base.
2579009 2581879 Surrounded by trained soldiers. Mercs.
2583147 2587051 I'm a biologist, and they have me on call in case there's...
2589019 2590087 contact.
2591755 2592923 What did I tell you?
2592957 2594825 End days. End days.
2594858 2596260 Nettles, if you don't stop with this Bible shit,
2596293 2597695 I'm gonna set you on fire.
2597728 2599096 Guys, if we wanna keep breathing,
2599129 2600898 we need to find this thing.
2600931 2601999 Expose it.
2602633 2604134 It's called the Predator.
2604535 2606203 It hunts people for sport.
2606236 2608439 Technically, that's not a predator. That's like...
2608472 2609740 Thank you.
2609773 2611175 -It's a hunter. -I said the same thing.
2611208 2612876 NETTLES: A sportsman, or a hunter, or a fisherman.
2612910 2613711 COYLE: Well, look at you...
2614144 2616113 I was there when it escaped. It's looking for something.
2616614 2618682 Equipment. Weapons.
2621218 2622419 I took its gear.
2623487 2624688 What?
2624722 2625889 You took something from the thing?
2625923 2627758 -What? -So, I'd have evidence.
2629226 2630861 I think I know where it's going.
2634798 2636233 (whirring)
2662426 2663727 (growls)
2664361 2665462 What?
2676140 2678308 (indistinct chattering)
2684148 2685783 (door opens)
2689186 2691021 Oh, hi, honey, you're home.
2691588 2694024 -I'm looking for a package. -A package?
2694058 2695059 Rory!
2695259 2696994 Hey! This is not your house anymore!
2697027 2698262 QUINN: Rory!
2698295 2700964 Hey, buddy. Where are ya?
2701331 2702866 He's not here.
2703133 2704401 What do you mean, he's not here?
2705969 2707104 Oh, shit!
2707137 2709039 What? So we ordered some video games.
2709073 2711041 No! No! No!
2711075 2713277 The whole fucking reason I sent it to a P.O. box,
2713310 2714978 was so I didn't put you in danger.
2715446 2716780 Goddamn it, we need to find him.
2716814 2717948 Wait, Quinn, you're scaring me now.
2718215 2719516 (footsteps)
2721018 2722886 (indistinct chatter)
2728092 2729226 I specifically said
2729259 2731128 no first-person shooter. No combat games.
2731161 2732896 Did you ever think that maybe he plays them
2732930 2733997 to connect with his father?
2734031 2735299 Oh, my God. We're doing this again.
2735332 2737034 Hey! Can you stop taking all my...
2739203 2740537 Who are these people in my house?
2740571 2742873 Emily, loonies. Loonies, Emily.
2742906 2744241 Good evening.
2744274 2745843 Uh, the brushstrokes on this
2745876 2747444 are really dynamic. It's a wonderful piece.
2747478 2749146 Okay, you need to put that down.
2749179 2751081 What exactly is she doing with her right hand?
2751115 2752516 They're my unit. They're soldiers.
2752549 2754985 Marines. There's his unit. (laughing)
2755219 2756453 Hi. You seem like a really nice...
2756487 2758288 Oh, no, don't touch me. No.
2758322 2760457 Hang on. Back up. Your unit?
2760491 2762426 What happened to Haines and Dupree?
2763927 2764728 They're dead.
2765229 2767064 And the thing that killed them is out there looking for Rory.
2767097 2768332 What are you talking about?
2768365 2769433 There's something out there.
2770167 2772369 It tore my friends apart. What is it?
2772402 2773137 (Coyle stuttering)
2773570 2775572 Like, it's a creature. Seriously, it's not a person.
2775606 2776507 Like from the Bible.
2776774 2778375 -Revelations. -From the Bible?
2778408 2780377 That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
2780410 2781311 It's a space alien.
2781812 2783347 Know who Whoopi Goldberg is?
2783580 2785115 It's like an alien Whoopi Goldberg.
2786116 2787251 Oh, shit!
2787918 2788886 Shit.
2788919 2790187 I want a grid search.
2790220 2791288 Three teams.
2791655 2793023 (men exclaiming)
2793056 2793991 Hey!
2794792 2796960 -No. -No, no, I'm coming with you.
2796994 2798195 QUINN: No, nix that.
2798228 2799429 (gun cocking)
2799463 2801031 (Quinn clears throat)
2802533 2803967 Is there a problem?
2805235 2807137 Thing is, we're kind of moving targets.
2807171 2809506 Yeah, in case you haven't noticed, we're fugitives.
2809540 2811441 Yeah. Plus, like where are we gonna get our meds and stuff?
2811475 2813177 I get it. Fine, stay here and watch TV.
2813210 2816313 You know what? If you try to split? Or draw the Feds?
2816346 2817581 Or if you jeopardize my son
2817614 2819950 by your half-assed yardbird bullshit...
2819983 2821418 I will come back here, and I will happily
2821451 2823220 kill every single fucking one of you.
2829293 2831128 WILLIAMS: Come on, brothers. Let's go.
2831628 2833030 (door closes)
2834031 2835032 Seriously?
2835499 2836967 It's not our fight.
2842005 2843607 Is your husband the man I think he is?
2844675 2845909 Excuse me?
2846643 2848145 Tell me about your husband, please?
2850214 2852115 He's a security counter-sniper.
2852149 2853417 -Mmm. -Army Rangers.
2854585 2855452 He supervised
2855752 2858522 23 close precision engagements across five continents
2858555 2861024 and he has 13 confirmed kills.
2861458 2864294 And he is one of only 14 captains in the armed forces,
2864328 2866196 to ever receive a Distinguished Service Medal
2866230 2867331 and the Silver Star.
2868565 2870200 So, he might be a lousy husband,
2870234 2871602 but he is a good soldier.
2873704 2876573 Well, sounds like he can probably take care of himself.
2876607 2878208 -Yeah. -Jesus Christ.
2878242 2879343 That's what I thought.
2880310 2881478 Fucking pussies.
2883347 2885215 (door opens and closes)
2885249 2886383 Where you going, Nettles?
2888352 2890954 I didn't like your speech. It didn't really inspire me.
2891521 2894391 But... he called me a pussy
2894424 2896393 and nobody calls me a pussy, so...
2896426 2898028 -Fuck off, pussy. -Okay...
2898061 2899263 (clears throat)
2902199 2904234 Come on, Bax, let's go. Let's get some.
2904268 2906603 Before these army fuckers screw up the whole thing.
2911074 2912209 Come on, what are you doing? Let's move.
2912242 2913210 Hey!
2913243 2914278 You too, lucky charms.
2914311 2915379 LYNCH: Coyle, you wanker.
2917614 2919016 I'd like to watch TV
2919049 2920317 -with you sometime. -Okay.
2920350 2921451 I liked your speech.
2921485 2922686 BAXLEY: I liked the couch.
2924721 2926657 Whoa, what's happening? What?
2927157 2929426 Well, we're finding my son, that's what.
2930127 2931995 All right, when all this is over...
2932029 2934097 Fuck me in the face with an aardvark.
2934131 2935232 (groaning)
2937234 2938335 I just want to be famous.
2938368 2939102 LYNCH: Ostensibly,
2939403 2941071 if Forrest Gump just read the side of the box,
2941104 2942572 it would tell him exactly what he would get.
2942606 2944207 COYLE: You're using "ostensibly" incorrectly.
2944241 2945309 Is this for me?
2945342 2946743 This is like the reverse of a clown car.
2947077 2948345 All right, Nebraska,
2948378 2949579 let's find some wheels, nothing flashy.
2949613 2950647 Copy.

3461658 3462926 COYLE: What's the big one?
3462959 3464861 What's the big one, Doc? Is that like the male?
3465094 3466663 He didn't even give a shit about us.
3466696 3467764 Just wanted to kill that thing.
3471167 3472902 You saw that, right?
3472936 3475271 Guys! Did you see that? He--
3475305 3477874 He grew an exoskeleton under his fucking skin.
3480577 3482078 What, are they hunting each other now?
3490787 3491888 (speaking alien language)
3502131 3503900 (sirens wailing)
3515612 3517280 MAN: We're still sorting through it right now.
3521918 3522919 (cell phone vibrates)
3526155 3527957 -QUINN: Hey, it's me. -Tell me he's okay.
3527991 3529759 He's fine. I'm going to bring him back.
3529792 3530960 It's okay, don't say anything, just be safe.
3530994 3532929 MAN: Hey, no! Don't do that!
3533162 3535665 -What? Hello? -(line disconnects)
3540036 3541271 MAN: Damn it.
3541304 3543273 You guys fucked with the wrong family.
3544240 3545275 (sighs)
3545909 3548645 -How tall? -Witnesses say 11 feet.
3548678 3550013 TRAEGER: That's pretty fucking tall.
3550280 3551314 Okay.
3554684 3556653 -Fucked that nigga up. -Sir?
3557654 3558721 Nothing.
3560356 3561858 I'd be careful with that, sir.
3562692 3563927 (breathes deeply)
3563960 3565128 You know what I think?
3565161 3567597 I think this one went rogue. A runner.
3567864 3569232 Hmm. And the big one?
3569265 3570400 He's a tracker.
3570433 3571868 Sent to take that one out.
3572535 3574771 Some kind of interstellar cops and robbers.
3575204 3577340 Now he's going after that missing ship.
3577740 3579275 And whatever's on board.
3579909 3582178 I want that fucking ship.
3582211 3583346 We're in the ballpark.
3583746 3585281 Captain McKenna's son?
3585582 3586883 Mother confirms.
3587116 3588885 He has the operating system.
3588918 3590853 -Get the fuck out of here. -Thought it was a video game.
3590887 3592355 So, we find the kid, we find the ship.
3592388 3594324 What the fuck we still standing here for?
3594657 3596259 You don't want to know what that one is?
3596292 3598127 I know what it is. Our big boy's a hunter.
3598161 3599395 He brought his dogs with him.
3604200 3605668 No, it had to be like
3605702 3607270 a government experiment or some shit.
3608137 3609372 Like a robot, or whatever.
3609405 3611107 Nettles, are you fucking retarded, man?
3611140 3612942 Use another word, would ya?
3612976 3614978 Yeah, man. Show a little sensitivity.
3615011 3616279 His son's retarded.
3616713 3618181 BAXLEY: Here you go.
3618214 3619282 Here you go.
3619682 3621250 He does this from time to time.
3622085 3623119 Just give him a minute.
3623786 3625154 Hey, Lynch.
3626289 3628024 What's the deal with these two?
3628057 3629859 Coyle lit up one of his own vehicles?
3629892 3632395 Back in '09, yeah. It was bad business. Six dead.
3632662 3634030 What, no survivors?
3634063 3635765 Yeah, there was one.
3640737 3642005 It's fucking romantic.
3642438 3644307 Are you kidding me, they're friends?
3644340 3645141 Picture it.
3645408 3647343 Military inquiries, sitting outside courtroom,
3647377 3649145 waiting to go in, side by side,
3649178 3651047 -day after fucking day. -After fucking day.
3651381 3652382 Unbelievable.
3652415 3653816 It's the loonies.
3663059 3664127 QUINN: All right, kid.
3664761 3666129 I've talked to your mother.
3666863 3667964 She's doing fine.
3668831 3670166 Mom says you're a killer.
3671834 3674037 -Well, I'm a soldier. -(Williams clears throat)
3674404 3675838 What's the difference?
3679208 3680476 Well, when you like it,
3680910 3682345 that's when you're a killer.
3685114 3686449 -(sniffles) -Are you good?
3689152 3690386 Sorry I never grew up.
3691954 3694223 You know... the way you wanted.
3700396 3701431 Tell you a secret.
3704000 3705068 Truth is, kid,
3706436 3708071 I never grew up the way I wanted.
3711307 3714110 (sighs) Are we gonna get killed?
3714143 3715244 (grunts softly)
3718181 3719182 Nope.
3720817 3722452 Come on. (clears throat) Get up.
3722652 3724954 I'm single. I don't know if you knew that.
3725254 3727023 No, I could tell that you're single.
3727690 3730226 We got so much stuff in common, you know...
3730693 3733296 You like music, I like music. You like music, right?
3733329 3735198 -Shit. -What?
3736332 3737900 This is more than spinal fluid.
3737934 3738901 What does that mean?
3739202 3740236 If I'm right,
3741537 3743539 they're trying to upgrade themselves.
3743573 3745074 McKenna, I got something.
3745608 3747110 I think I know what they're up to
3747143 3748144 on Predator World these days.
3748377 3751547 You see this? They found this in the Predator's plexus.
3751748 3753082 So, remember how I told you
3753116 3754450 how they take people's spines, right?
3754984 3756519 Yeah, for trophies.
3756552 3759122 Yes! Yes! From the strongest, smartest,
3759155 3762125 most dangerous species on every planet they visit.
3762158 3763326 Collecting survival traits
3763359 3764861 from the most high-end specimens.
3765228 3767230 I think they're attempting hybridization.
3768898 3770366 You're just pulling this out of your ass.
3770399 3772335 Did you not see the new Predator?
3774170 3775304 It's evolving.
3775772 3777039 Or being upgraded.
3784547 3785948 QUINN: That little boy
3785982 3788084 managed to figure out alien technology.
3789318 3791187 You know, a lot of experts say that
3791220 3793322 being on the spectrum isn't really a disorder.
3793890 3796225 It's actually the next step in the evolutionary chain.
3796659 3798161 NETTLES: Hey, yo! What the fuck?
3798194 3799362 Get the fuck away from me!
3799395 3801564 Yo! Casey! (whistling)
3802498 3804000 QUINN: Casey, get inside.
3804634 3805434 Casey!
3805735 3808371 Hey, hey, hey! Calm down! Calm down! Calm down!
3808404 3809906 Casey! Look.
3809939 3812108 I think this thing's been following us, all right?
3812141 3814877 -Move, Netty! -Hey, hey, hey!
3814911 3816445 -Space dog! -Move, Netty!
3816479 3817914 (whimpers)
3820550 3821617 Fuck that.
3821651 3823252 Hey! You had your fucking chance.
3823286 3824387 (creature whines)
3824420 3827323 Look, I'm just saying, what the fuck is it gonna do?
3827356 3829258 You know, maybe we can use it, or something?
3829292 3831294 Okay, what are we doing? What are we doing with it?
3831327 3833529 We're gonna study it. That's what we're gonna do with it.
3833563 3835131 What's to learn? Except Williams sucks
3835164 3836532 at shooting shit in the head.
3836566 3838434 Williams, you lobotomized him. (chuckles)
3838467 3840970 Okay, new rule. No one shoots my fucking dog.
3841003 3842038 (creature growls)
3842071 3843206 BAXLEY: There it is. It's official.
3843239 3844874 You were right, we can use this.
3849045 3850046 BAXLEY: Shit.
3850479 3851881 COYLE: Netty, what is that?
3854317 3855184 WILLIAMS: Everybody, tighten up.
3855451 3857253 -Little man, come here. -NETTLES: That's an EC-130.
3857286 3858387 That's not civilian.
3858421 3859222 Hey, hey, hey!
3859555 3862024 You are not starting a firefight with my kid here.
3862058 3862892 WILLIAMS: There you go.
3863259 3866062 Do you wanna help? Go get a helicopter and some pyro.
3866095 3867930 All right! On me!
3868130 3869065 Now go!
3869098 3871534 -Casey! I'll be right back! -No, you won't.
3871567 3873402 Hold on. Hey. See this?
3873436 3875571 Come on. Let's go! Let's go! Come on!
3875771 3877473 -Fetch! -(creature huffing)
3881544 3882912 (coughing)
3901130 3902164 Where is it?
3902365 3903366 Where's what?
3904600 3905635 The device.
3905968 3908437 It goes, right in here.
3910206 3911274 (grunting)
3914243 3916312 Okay, so, the first Predator, Thing One.
3916545 3918481 Why'd he come here? To Earth?
3918748 3920983 The "Thing One", as you called him,
3921017 3923219 arrived in a hijacked spacecraft.
3923653 3925321 We think there's something on it.
3925655 3927323 Something he didn't want his enemies to have.
3927890 3929191 CASEY: Wait, enemies?
3929492 3931694 Other Predators. Like that big one.
3931727 3934497 So, he brought some what? Gift for the human race?
3934530 3936132 I'll help you find it. We can analyze it...
3936165 3937400 Shut the fuck up!
3941270 3942505 Why are they here?
3944707 3947343 You remember a few years back when Hostess went bust?
3947877 3949979 There was a run on Twinkies?
3950212 3952114 Snapped up from coast-to-coast.
3952148 3953649 Get 'em while they still last.
3954517 3955518 Remember?
3956519 3960022 How long before climate change renders this planet unlivable?
3961357 3962525 Two generations?
3963559 3964527 One?
3964560 3966629 CASEY: That's why their visits are increasing?
3966662 3967797 They're trying to snap up
3967830 3969398 all of our best DNA before we're gone.
3969665 3973035 Adapt themselves with it and then move in.
3973536 3976305 We're an endangered species, and they know it.
3976339 3978040 They thrive in a hothouse environment.
3978341 3980209 Maybe they want to move into ours.
3981143 3982345 And that dead Predator
3982378 3984146 was bringing us a way to stop them.
3985548 3986482 (grunts)
3986515 3989185 You've hidden this thing before in the mail.
3989218 3990186 (groans)
3990453 3992054 So, where is it this time?
3992088 3993422 Your mother's ass.
3993789 3995491 Wait, did I say that out loud?
3996225 3997460 (grunts)
3999395 4002398 Hey! Hey! Hey! No, no, no. That is not for you.
4002431 4003232 That is my son's,
4003532 4005101 and you are violating his privacy reading that.
4005134 4006268 You both need to leave right now.
4006469 4008371 Ma'am, I don't wanna restrain you.
4008637 4010573 Really? Well, why don't you try?
4011841 4013609 (objects clattering)
4015745 4018080 (footsteps running)
4024520 4025821 (snarling)
4030326 4031394 (yells)
4032561 4033662 (gunshots)
4033896 4035598 (snarling)
4039568 4042238 (low growling)
4050413 4052581 (speaking alien language)
4062892 4064593 CRYPTOGRAPHER: You haven't found the spacecraft?
4064627 4066429 Why are we trying to crack the entry code?
4066462 4068497 SAPIR: Because when we do find it, wouldn't it be great
4068531 4069665 if we could get into the fucking thing?
4069698 4070833 What's that?
4071667 4072768 A map.
4073202 4074003 A map to what?
4074537 4076572 CRYPTOGRAPHER: ...give us a clue of where this place is,
4076772 4078474 maybe we can try to get into it.
4078507 4080443 But if you don't give us anything, we can't get in!
4088884 4089885 (grunts)
4092321 4093489 (whimpering)
4093689 4095891 Hey, Rory, I'm Will.
4096559 4097626 How you doing?
4098027 4100162 I understand you know where the spaceship is.
4113976 4115177 Golf tomorrow?
4115478 4116545 Why not?
4117113 4119315 You two never read my file, did ya?
4119815 4120716 What makes you say that?
4120983 4123486 'Cause you two morons are making plans for tomorrow.
4123886 4124954 (laughing)
4124987 4126288 The worst part is,
4126489 4128557 you're making me lie to my son.
4129959 4131627 What lie did you tell him, hmm?
4132928 4134463 That I won't enjoy this.
4135831 4137333 (grunting)
4138868 4139902 (screams)
4139935 4141537 (mouthing)
4143372 4144740 -(gun cocking) -Hey, please, don't.
4145574 4147676 Look, I don't know what they told you...
4147710 4149979 Can you just wait for a second? Just wait!
4150012 4151547 No, no, no!
4151981 4153182 No.
4153382 4154817 (grunting softly)
4158387 4160222 -Jeez! -(yipping)
4160256 4161323 Oh, my God.
4166529 4167530 (retches)
4173269 4174470 (both grunting)
4188317 4189318 (gasping)
4193722 4195224 (grunting)
4198594 4199628 Nebraska!
4199828 4201664 -Yeah? -You just kill somebody?
4201697 4202798 Well, he ain't well.
4202831 4204033 Untie my friend.
4204066 4205568 They got Rory. We gotta move.
4206035 4207469 Shit, they rough you up?
4207770 4209572 Did worse on myself, back in the day.
4209605 4211006 (grunting)
4211040 4212675 What do you want to do with this guy?
4215611 4217346 Sorry, buddy, that was a dumb question.
4217379 4218514 Yeah, that was a dumb question.
4219481 4220849 (panting)
4226455 4227590 (low growling)
4231727 4232728 QUINN: Casey!
4235798 4237800 Can I interest you in getting the fuck out of here?
4238434 4240436 "Getting the fuck out of here" is my middle name.
4241103 4242771 And I thought Gaylord was bad.
4242805 4243839 (Quinn groans)
4243872 4245274 (stomach grumbling)
4245708 4247476 What? What's wrong?
4248077 4249678 (toilet flushing)
4250813 4252681 Whew! All right.
4252881 4254950 Hey! Just let me unpack this.
4254984 4256719 You're saying my son's headed towards a spaceship
4256752 4257987 and so is a 10-foot alien.
4258020 4259488 Uh, 11, actually.
4259521 4260789 Used to be a contractor.
4261023 4262691 This thing is a hybrid? What does that mean?
4262725 4264793 Meaning it's the Chinese menu of DNA.
4264827 4266829 Comprised of the deadliest species in the entire...
4266862 4268063 In the entire universe, yeah?
4268097 4269665 -Galaxy. -What?
4269698 4271734 Galaxy. 250 billion stars.
4271767 4273435 Why go universe? Just saying.
4273902 4275437 (helicopter whirring)
4287516 4289485 Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ!
4289518 4290552 That's what you asked for?
4290586 4291587 Yeah, that'll do.
4293088 4294456 Saddle up!
4298060 4299561 COYLE: It's the best we could do, man.
4302698 4303732 WILLIAMS: Go ahead. Go!
4303766 4305034 That's it? Another one.
4305067 4306368 QUINN: The other one!
4306402 4307770 Come on. Let's go get my kid.
4311173 4313542 Figured something out. I think we're gonna die.
4314410 4316612 We're gonna go hunt and fight the what, the army?
4316645 4317880 COYLE: We're not gonna fight the army...
4317913 4319648 BAXLEY: And some fucking people from space!
4319682 4321050 You wanna talk survival, huh?
4321684 4322751 Fine!
4322785 4324887 You, yesterday, you were on a prison bus
4324920 4326088 barking to yourself,
4326121 4327956 now you got a gun in your hand.
4327990 4329358 Who's a survivor now?
4331060 4332594 We put bullets in our head
4332628 4333996 and walk to the fucking hospital.
4334663 4335731 We're soldiers!
4337433 4338701 Nettles, what's our 20?
4339168 4340903 I can follow your boy's chopper.
4340936 4342137 I locked into its frequency.
4356652 4357753 SOLDIER: Fence is hot!
4374970 4376538 (indistinct radio chatter)
4377840 4379007 What do you say, buddy?
4379775 4381443 You think you can get us in there?
4382144 4384113 Because I'm not sure that you can.
4384546 4385981 Nice reverse psychology.
4386482 4387916 I can do that, too.
4388117 4389485 Don't go fuck yourself.
4390719 4391820 (laughs)
4392821 4394189 TRAEGER: That's good. Come on.
4394590 4396925 Good. Almost up and running. Five minutes.
4396959 4397993 TRAEGER: Right on.
4398026 4399528 It's a translator unit, Rory.
4399795 4400929 Been trying to figure out
4400963 4402197 what these bird-chirping motherfuckers
4402231 4403732 been saying since '87.
4403766 4405534 Gave the Harvard School of Linguistics
4405567 4406835 a billion-dollar grant.
4406869 4409037 Voila. Watch your step, come on.
4421583 4423886 Goddamn, kid, I don't know where you get it from.
4425087 4426922 (trilling)
4451313 4453248 TRAEGER: Put the translator into the mainframe.
4453282 4454616 Download everything.
4461557 4462758 SAPIR: What the hell's inside there?
4462991 4464660 It's property of Project Stargazer.
4464693 4466728 That's what the fuck it is. (laughs)
4468764 4470232 OFFICER (on comms): Code three. Code three.
4470265 4471767 We have motion at the south fence line.
4472134 4473602 Send a fireteam to check it out.
4473869 4475971 That's my dad. He's gonna come save me now.
4476605 4477639 Oh, is he?
4478874 4480175 Is that what he's gonna do?
4480776 4482211 I'll tell you what, buddy...
4483345 4484746 if it is your daddy,
4485080 4486915 and I truly hope that it is...
4487449 4489318 he's gotta be just about
4489351 4492688 the dumbest motherfucker I've ever met. (laughing)
4494857 4498060 I mean, a Ranger sniper tripping wire sensors?
4498093 4499294 He's gotta be...
4501029 4502297 creating a diversion.
4502331 4503832 It's a fucking diversion.
4504199 4505234 (grunts)
4505267 4506702 Oh, shit!
4506735 4508003 Wow. Howdy.
4508237 4510005 What, are you gonna kill us with a fucking tranq gun?
4510572 4512274 You took my boy, so yeah.
4513041 4514042 Told you.
4514977 4515978 Take this, son.
4516411 4519014 You outta your mind? We literally have you surrounded.
4519047 4520582 That's why you're coming with me.
4520616 4522050 I just want the boy. Nobody's got to die.
4522084 4522985 Dad?
4525654 4527022 From here forward.
4527055 4528624 Don't look at the dead guy.
4542905 4544172 (grunting)
4549111 4550345 That was pretty good.
4550379 4551713 You all right? Did I get you?
4551747 4552748 No, I'm good.
4553682 4554816 Welcome back.
4554850 4555951 Fuck you. I never left.
4558954 4559922 You open your mouth,
4559955 4561957 I'm gonna blow your brains right through it.
4561990 4563125 Come on, just get behind me.
4563525 4565227 SOLDIER (on radio): All units. They got Traeger.
4565260 4566295 They got Traeger.
4567930 4569064 (softly) Let's go. Let's go.
4569598 4571333 Just tell them to put the guns down.
4581143 4582177 Tell them!
4584146 4585681 If Captain McKenna doesn't lower his weapon
4585714 4586481 in the next 10 seconds...
4586748 4588717 shoot the kid's knees out. That work for you?
4588750 4590018 Oh, that's a really bad idea.
4590285 4592721 My guys got this place covered on every angle.
4592754 4594289 That's a funny story. See, I don't give a shit.
4594323 4595257 10.
4596725 4597759 Nine.
4598327 4599328 Eight.
4600829 4601830 Seven.
4602364 4604299 Come on, you just give the fucking word, man.
4604333 4605367 TRAEGER: Six. Five.

4733695 4734996 Hey, McKenna.
4735197 4737933 Be reasonable. There's six of you, seven of us.
4738567 4739835 (grunts)
4740035 4741136 Fuck!
4741169 4742537 Who taught you math?
4742771 4744973 You ain't the only fucking sniper, white boy.
4746942 4749044 You can walk away from this, Captain.
4749611 4751213 I just want the ship.
4751246 4753415 -Dad, he's lying. -Yeah.
4753448 4755884 McKenna! I don't like this.
4756251 4757452 What's he doing in there?
4759488 4760922 (predator warbling)
4762190 4764392 -(loud warbling) -(feedback whines)
4766161 4768230 (all groan)
4769364 4771066 It's using the translator.
4773268 4775237 PREDATOR (over speaker): Hello. I have enjoyed
4775437 4777005 watching you kill each other.
4777405 4779841 I came here to destroy this vessel.
4780142 4781910 You cannot have it.
4781943 4784079 What you can do is run.
4784613 4787549 I detect one among you who is a true warrior.
4787916 4790018 The one called McKenna.
4792053 4793288 He will be your leader.
4794089 4795290 He will be my prize.
4795624 4797492 I offer time advantage.
4798460 4799461 Go.
4799828 4801429 What the fuck is time advantage?
4801463 4802531 Like a head start?
4803598 4805934 (alarm sounding)
4806234 4807602 I'm gonna wake up on a bus.
4808570 4810005 I'm gonna wake up on a bus.
4812974 4813975 Hey!
4814309 4815343 I'm coming out!

4827022 4828456 -Baxley! -Shit!
4828490 4830058 Watch where the fuck you're throwing, dickhead.
4830525 4832027 -(vehicle engine stalling) -Will do.
4832828 4835197 Okay, so we split up. 12 different directions.
4835230 4837098 -McKenna's the one he wants. -TRAEGER: No, no, no!
4837132 4839367 We stay together, or it'll take us one by one.
4839401 4841002 He's right. It's their MO.
4841036 4843004 -Grow a dick, will you? -SOLDIER: Nothing's starting!
4843038 4845106 Son of a bitch. He must have hacked the vehicles.
4845307 4847475 If we can get to the helicopter, go two klicks north.
4847509 4848310 -Got you. -Hey?
4848610 4850612 When this is over, you and me, we're gonna dance.
4850645 4851980 I got my shoes all picked out.
4852013 4853014 All right.
4859187 4861056 (soft growling)

4919347 4921983 Hey. On Halloween, this blew up a whole house.
4922017 4923585 -How do you shoot it? -You don't.
4923618 4925654 It just fires by itself when it's being attacked.
4925687 4927255 Seriously? Oh, shit.
4929024 4930458 (man coughing)
4931660 4933495 (faint rustling)

5003431 5005200 Let's find it and trap the motherfucker.
5005233 5007535 You guys go set it up. We'll lure him in.

5729924 5731525 I see you saw Lynch's card.
5734161 5736130 Baxley had this the whole time.
5739467 5740935 Nebraska's bad habit.
5742436 5743504 Son...

5747308 5748509 Just us.
5749143 5751078 What do you say we put them to rest?
5789150 5792253 (indistinct announcement over PA)
5795055 5796257 Captain McKenna.
5799260 5800394 Hiroshi Yamada.
5800427 5802296 -Sir. -First things first.
5802496 5804598 I want to say thank you for having such a great kid.
5804632 5805499 He loves it here.
5805733 5807968 Yeah, he's something else. What do we got, Doctor?
5808002 5810070 Well, I assume that you know by now,
5810371 5813040 but the first Predator, it didn't come here to hunt us.
5813274 5815176 -He brought something. -Exactly.
5815209 5816544 Now, you want to hear the good news?
5817978 5819180 The cargo survived.
5820147 5821649 With some sort of fail-safe.
5821682 5823918 Before the upgrade Predator blew up the ship,
5824151 5825352 a pod escaped.
5825386 5826954 Jettisoned. Saved itself.
5828022 5831492 It seems that our boy wasn't taking any chances.
5831926 5834228 He wanted us to have this.
5834261 5835529 (door sliding open)
5838032 5840034 (indistinct announcement)
5847975 5849977 What is it again you do here, exactly?
5850544 5853314 He's the world's number one authority on cybernetics.
5855416 5856884 QUINN: Hey, kiddo.
5859153 5860287 RORY: Pretty cool, huh?
5860321 5861622 Pretty cool. You got your own desk.
5861655 5863157 I'll make sure to tell Mom.
5864425 5868095 So, this is his gift to humankind?
5874401 5877471 (static interference)
5882176 5884111 -(electricity crackling) -(woman screams)

5890851 5892286 (indistinct shouting)
5895289 5897091 Dad, the pod sent me a message.
5899460 5901595 -Rory, what's in that pod? -Don't know!
5903230 5904665 Oh, wow... Oh, shit!
5904698 5906467 -It's got a name! -Name? What name?
5906800 5908702 I guess you'd call it,
5908736 5910271 the Predator Killer.
5910604 5912506 -QUINN: Get him out of here! -Come with me. Let's go.
5914208 5916010 SOLDIER 1: Get back. Clear the area.
5916043 5917077 SOLDIER 2: Eyes on it.
5943771 5946073 (device trilling)
5949109 5951312 Whatever it is, it appears to be dormant.
5951779 5954248 -I assume it needs to be... -(women gasp)
5954281 5956650 SOLDIER: Eyes on. Keep your weapons trained.
5956984 5959486 (gasps) Get it off! Get it off me!
5959753 5961755 (screaming)
5992553 5994054 What the hell is that?
5994421 5996090 That's my new suit, bubba.
5998425 6000260 I hope they got it in a 42 long.
