150984 152194 HAINES (on radio):<br />Picket One, copy.
152236 153779 Do you got eyes<br />on the hostages?
154112 155364 Still negative.
155989 157908 DUPREE (on radio): 20 bucks<br />says they don't show.
158283 159868 You two morons<br />really making bets
159910 162663 on whether a drug cartel<br />has executed these hostages?
162704 163622 DUPREE: Abso-fucking-lutely.
163664 165123 HAINES: I believe<br />that was implied. Yeah.
165165 166917 Just checking. I'm in for 20.

331748 332916 It's evidence.
332958 334835 Ain't nobody<br />gonna believe this one.

524358 525442 (speaks Spanish)

533742 534952 And I have money.
534993 537371 (speaks Spanish) Why should I<br />help a man with a gun, eh?

551510 552511 (gasps)
558141 560561 I need you<br />to mail this for me.

616867 618160 (exclaims)
620871 623332 -(laughs) Do it, man.<br />-No, you do it.

648190 649775 Hey, EJ, you hungry?
649816 652277 I'm hungry for an ass-burger.
652319 653695 Mmm. Sounds delicious.
654029 656198 A nice, big, juicy ass-burger.
656240 658325 -EJ: Oh, yeah.<br />-(whimpering)
660285 661745 The hell are you doing?
663163 665040 -DEREK: He's a goner.<br />-All right.

743911 744953 Hi, there.
745287 747372 Does, uh, Quinn McKenna<br />live here?
747956 750626 His post office box payments<br />are past due.
752419 753712 Department of Defense.
754505 756048 He works for the government,<br />does he?
756840 759593 MOS-1-1-B-3-V-W-3.
760552 761929 Military designation.
762346 764556 -Ah.<br />-He kills people...
766099 767476 so you can be a mailman.
774650 776610 (dogs barking)
781114 782199 Dr. Brackett?
789414 792251 I understand<br />you enjoy stargazing?
795045 796547 My men<br />will take care of your dog.
796588 797756 Will you come with me, please?
809476 810519 What am I looking at?
812187 814314 It's exactly<br />what you think it is. Yeah.
816817 818569 They've been here before.
818610 820779 '87. '97.
823031 826535 Lately, the visits<br />are increasing in frequency.
837296 840382 EMILY: Rory, I'm home!<br />Hey, I got you something.
841592 842593 Hey.
846096 848098 Did you do<br />one of these after school?
848473 849725 I did all of them.
850517 852102 Oh. Okay.
852811 856064 Well, I got you two options.
857274 858400 We have...
859234 861195 pirate, or...
863655 864698 Frankenstein.
867201 868952 Frankenstein,<br />you know, green skin?
869578 871371 Threw a girl<br />to see if she would float?
873498 874625 No. Okay.
874666 876877 Well, let's go with pirate.<br />Yeah?
877503 878545 This is dumb.
880005 881632 The guys will...
882591 884051 They will still<br />be able to see.
885427 886470 See what?
887429 888472 That it's me.
891058 893143 PSYCHOLOGIST: You were once<br />quoted as saying,
893185 895229 "I dropped<br />from my mother's womb...
895521 897231 I hit the floor...
897689 899024 and I started crawling
899066 901527 through hostile territory<br />toward my grave."
901568 903403 (laughing)
903737 904821 QUINN: About right, yeah.
904863 906907 -That's badass.<br />-It's pretty morbid.
906949 908033 It's pretty dark.
908867 911578 What's with the polygraph?
911620 912913 I thought<br />this was a psych eval.
913288 915374 We need to know<br />if you pose a threat.
915415 916583 Oh, I'm a sniper.
917417 919503 Isn't posing a threat<br />kind of the fucking point?
920337 923382 You spend most of your time<br />now in-country...
923799 925759 estranged from your wife<br />and son?
929054 930347 (sighs)
931723 933100 Look, I get it.
933851 937020 Something went down in Mexico<br />and nobody wants any witnesses.
937062 937938 Excuse me?
938397 940691 You're not here<br />to find out if I'm crazy.
941316 943443 You wanna make sure<br />the label sticks.
943485 944945 So, you feel<br />you're being railroaded?
945237 947489 I can see the tracks<br />on the floor!
949157 950909 I don't see tracks<br />on the floor, for the record.
951243 952870 You feel<br />like you're a stranger
952911 954329 on your own planet,<br />don't you, Captain?
956039 958166 Like an alien, you mean?
961545 963088 That's what you wanted.
965507 966884 Do I get a cookie now?
967634 968802 He saw something.
968844 969928 -Oh, yeah.<br />-Yeah.
1015557 1016934 Wow!
1029613 1030696 Ow.
1039080 1040123 (beeps)
1050926 1053637 (device trilling)
1058892 1060435 (exhales deeply)
1061812 1063981 You shove me again,<br />I'm gonna break your neck.
1064815 1066149 Did I say that out loud?
1070571 1072114 -(Quinn clears throat)<br />-McKenna.
1074992 1076118 OFFICER: Last one.
1076159 1077661 Thanks for your kindness.<br />Thank you.
1083458 1084626 (sighs)
1086920 1088130 (keys jangling)
1095470 1096471 Oh, yeah?
1099266 1100309 (Baxley mumbles)
1101476 1103061 (clicks and sniffs)
1103979 1105189 You all right over there?
1105230 1107065 No, don't worry about him.<br />He's just got Tourettes.
1107107 1109067 -He can't control it.<br />-Fuck you, Coyle.
1109109 1110527 You get used to it, bro.
1115866 1117492 Welcome to Group Two.
1117534 1118952 Oh, yeah? What's that?
1118994 1120120 Like a unit?
1120162 1121788 No, group. Group Two.
1122080 1123749 Group therapy, room two.
1124958 1126168 Oh.
1126210 1127878 -McKenna.<br />-Nebraska Williams.
1127920 1129046 That's your real name?
1129087 1130255 Gaylord.
1130297 1132132 -That's a good call, then.<br />-Yeah, I thought so.
1132382 1133675 (chuckles)
1133717 1135010 Where did you serve?
1135594 1137513 Operation<br />Enduring Freedom, '03.
1138180 1140849 Went for the Taliban,<br />stayed for the opium.
1141808 1142935 (laughing)
1144937 1147231 That's Coyle.<br />Friendly fire incident.
1147606 1150192 Got turned around, fired<br />at one of his own vehicles.
1151401 1152653 Now, he tells jokes.
1152694 1153820 (Coyle clears throat)
1153862 1155989 -(thuds)<br />-(grunts) That's Lynch.
1156448 1158534 Got a medal for blowing up<br />half a mountain in Mosul.
1159159 1160410 Entropy.
1161203 1162454 That's my game.
1162996 1164706 Things like to fall apart
1164748 1166792 and I... make it happen.
1168001 1169795 Just... Just like that.
1169837 1172089 -(gasping)<br />-Ooh! Wow! Oh.
1173215 1174967 -Hey.<br />-Hey. Don't.
1176969 1177970 Don't.
1178303 1179471 That's Nettles.
1179805 1181890 (stutters) Okay, I'm Nettles.
1182266 1184017 Did three tours flying Hueys.
1184059 1186311 He loves his Bible.<br />Hey, Netty?
1186353 1187980 Is it end times yet?
1188021 1189481 Yeah, laugh all you want.
1189523 1191525 But when you're standing at<br />attention before your Maker...
1191567 1193569 I always stand at attention<br />before I make her.
1193610 1195320 -(whistles)<br />-(laughter)
1195362 1196905 God makes shitty people.
1197573 1198657 Yeah.
1198699 1200951 I mean, why do you think<br />people make war?
1200993 1202452 Why, Baxley?<br />Why do we make war?
1202494 1204872 -Come on, Baxley!<br />-Because fuck-cock-cock!
1204913 1206874 -Because we fuck cock-cock?<br />-Yes, we fuck cocks.
1206915 1208166 That's it,<br />because we fuck cocks,
1208208 1209501 that's why. We get upset.
1209877 1212087 How'd you snag a ticket<br />on this shitmobile?
1212754 1214256 Put a bullet in a CO.
1215299 1216758 Any particular reason?
1218510 1219720 He was an asshole.
1242868 1244161 Keep your head down.
1252628 1253795 Here, throw this on.
1258759 1260052 (bell rings)
1262179 1263931 Is it just your imagination?
1264348 1267434 Or is this haunted room<br />actually stretching?
1269019 1270229 Every fucking time?
1271271 1272523 (elevator dings)
1272940 1274733 AUTOMATED VOICE:<br />Your attention, please.
1274775 1278362 The GRC meeting has been moved<br />to section 3, room A.
1278403 1280489 Aha! There you are!
1281823 1284326 Welcome.<br />I'm Sean Keyes.
1284993 1286954 Wow. I heard you basically<br />wrote the book
1286995 1288413 on evolutionary biology.
1288455 1290123 Um, I'm sorry, can I just...
1290415 1291500 Is that...?
1294294 1295754 Oh, my God!
1297339 1299800 (chuckles nervously)<br />Holy shit.
1300300 1301844 That's alien technology.
1304179 1305806 This is what<br />you brought me here to see?
1306557 1308183 KEYES: Well, yeah.
1308976 1311520 Can I... Can I see this?<br />Can I get into this?
1311895 1312896 Doc.
1313647 1314857 Let's go.
1314898 1316984 (indistinct PA announcement)
1327619 1329329 -TRAEGER: Everything good?<br />-Yes, sir.
1330539 1331748 TRAEGER: What is it?
1333750 1334835 Dr. Brackett.
1335460 1337171 Would you like<br />to meet a Predator?
1337921 1339298 (chuckles) Come on.
1347848 1349224 WOMAN (on PA):<br />Please observe
1349266 1351059 decontamination protocol.
1351768 1353687 KEYES: So, how'd they<br />rope you into this?
1354062 1356273 I wrote a letter to<br />the president when I was six.
1356315 1357691 Told him how much<br />I loved animals,
1357733 1359276 and that if NASA<br />ever found a space animal,
1359568 1360777 they should call me.
1361236 1363864 Couple years ago,<br />I was put on a short list
1363906 1365657 for a paper<br />I wrote on hybrid strains.
1365949 1369328 Computer cross-referenced<br />the letter, and... here I am.
1371038 1372456 (machine whirring)
1377085 1378253 Dr. Brackett.
1379338 1380797 Thanks for coming.
1380839 1382132 I'm sure you have questions.
1382466 1384968 -Oh. Just two, actually.<br />-Okay.
1385469 1386929 Why do you call it<br />"the Predator"?
1387721 1389181 It's a nickname.
1389973 1392684 You know, the data suggests<br />that it tracks its prey.
1392935 1394269 Exploits weakness.
1394561 1395979 Seems to...
1396563 1397648 well, enjoy it.
1397940 1399274 Like a game.
1399316 1401276 That's not a predator,<br />that's a sports hunter.
1401318 1402194 Sorry?
1402486 1404738 A predator<br />kills its prey to survive.
1404780 1408617 I mean, what you're describing<br />is more like a bass fisherman.
1408659 1410619 Well, we took a vote.<br />Predator's cooler, right?
1410661 1412538 -SAPIR: Fuck yeah.<br />-Fuck yeah.
1412829 1414706 Found his escape pod<br />in Mexico.
1414748 1416416 Still looking<br />for the ship he came in.
1417292 1418710 He's heavily sedated.
1424550 1426802 You are<br />one beautiful motherfucker.
1427845 1430597 I'm gonna guess your second<br />question is, why are you here?
1432850 1435936 Our test results yielded<br />something a little... odd.
1437771 1439314 (scoffs) Is this a joke?
1439982 1442067 KEYES: We ran the genome<br />sequence ten times.
1442568 1444111 This specimen has...
1444152 1445821 -Human DNA?<br />-Yeah.
1445863 1446905 Yeah.
1446947 1449825 Look, we know<br />about spontaneous speciation.
1449867 1451410 Mostly plants and insects,<br />but...
1451451 1454121 But some mammals,<br />sheep, goats, uh...
1454162 1455122 Yeah.
1455163 1456832 KEYES: The red wolf<br />is known to be a hybrid
1456874 1458166 between the coyote<br />and the grey wolf...
1458208 1460544 Or possibly some form of<br />recombinant technology...

2463297 2464423 I should have bet you<br />that time!
2464464 2465757 -I like her.<br />-NETTLES: I like her.
2465799 2467176 I like her. I like her a lot.
2467217 2468594 QUINN: Give me that,<br />ding-dong.
2468635 2471388 COYLE: Oh, shit! Attagirl.
2471680 2474766 What? You're a scientist, huh?<br />What they got you working on?
2475642 2477686 You're not gonna last a day<br />out there!
2479938 2481607 What, you think you're special?
2482191 2484484 Back at the dam, they were gonna<br />put a bullet in your head.
2485068 2486320 They were gonna shoot her?
2486361 2487362 Yes.
2487988 2489281 Oh, I'm sorry.
2489781 2491825 Get out of the way.<br />See you around.
2494161 2495662 (stutters) Eat your pussy.
2496246 2497456 Wait, what?
2497497 2498832 How you doing?
2498874 2500334 No, you just said,<br />"Eat your pussy."
2500375 2501335 Hey...
2501376 2503086 -How you doing?<br />-No, you said, "Eat my pussy."
2503128 2504379 What the fuck<br />is wrong with him?
2504421 2506048 -I said you're pushy.<br />-He said you're pushy.
2506089 2507132 No, you said,<br />"Eat your pussy."
2507174 2508842 No. I said,<br />"Sheesh! You're pushy!"
2508884 2510135 CASEY: No, you said,<br />"Eat my pussy."
2510177 2511512 No, that's what he said,<br />I heard it.
2511553 2513305 -He said... pushy.<br />-What the fuck?
2513347 2514973 Which is also fucking rude.
2515015 2516517 He doesn't mean your pussy<br />in particular.
2516558 2517976 You're insane, right?
2518018 2519394 -Are you fucking insane?<br />-COYLE: Probably.
2519436 2520521 Well, what's it gonna be?
2520562 2522147 -BAXLEY: He's fucking crazy.<br />-NETTLES: Fuck you, Baxley.
2522189 2523232 BAXLEY: I feel fine.
2523857 2525025 CASEY: They were gonna<br />shoot me?
2525651 2526652 Why?
2527194 2530656 Uh, maybe 'cause of this?
2535661 2536995 Well, I guess I'm in.
2538372 2539915 Stay the fuck away from me.
2543418 2544628 What the fuck is this?
2545754 2547130 What is this?
2547172 2549591 -What is that? Like a unicorn?<br />-NETTLES: A unicorn.
2549633 2550968 -It's a unicorn.<br />-A unicorn.
2551260 2552845 I made a unicorn...
2552886 2554596 I'm sorry,<br />it's a piece of shit.
2554638 2557432 So, what's the upside to me<br />staying here with you guys?
2557474 2559184 Uh, maybe staying alive?
2559226 2560561 We are soldiers.
2560602 2561854 We're the good guys, okay?
2561895 2563272 CASEY: Well, that's debatable.
2563313 2567359 I read your file.<br />The guys in Mexico it killed?
2567401 2568443 They yours?
2568986 2570445 They're gonna need<br />a patsy for that.
2570487 2571655 You're looking at him.
2571905 2573240 Yeah, I figured.
2573282 2575701 Ex-sniper with PTSD? That's<br />actually kind of perfect.
2575742 2576994 How about you telling us
2577286 2579037 what you were doing<br />in a secret base.
2579079 2581915 Surrounded by<br />trained soldiers. Mercs.
2583500 2587129 I'm a biologist, and they have<br />me on call in case there's...
2589089 2590174 contact.
2591758 2592968 What did I tell you?
2593010 2594845 End days. End days.
2594887 2596388 Nettles, if you don't stop<br />with this Bible shit,
2596430 2597681 I'm gonna set you on fire.
2597723 2599183 Guys, if we wanna<br />keep breathing,
2599224 2600934 we need to find this thing.
2600976 2602060 Expose it.
2602853 2604229 It's called the Predator.
2604730 2606315 It hunts people for sport.
2606356 2608609 Technically, that's not<br />a predator. That's like...
2608650 2609735 Thank you.
2609776 2611278 -It's a hunter.<br />-I said the same thing.
2611320 2612905 NETTLES: A sportsman,<br />or a hunter, or a fisherman.
2612946 2614031 COYLE: Well, look at you...
2614072 2616200 I was there when it escaped.<br />It's looking for something.
2616825 2618660 Equipment. Weapons.
2621330 2622581 I took its gear.
2623665 2624666 What?
2624708 2625918 You took something<br />from the thing?
2625959 2627753 -What?<br />-So, I'd have evidence.
2629338 2630881 I think I know<br />where it's going.
2634801 2636345 (whirring)
2662579 2663705 (growls)
2664498 2665624 What?
2676218 2678428 (indistinct chattering)
2684226 2685769 (door opens)
2689273 2691066 Oh, hi, honey, you're home.
2691775 2694069 -I'm looking for a package.<br />-A package?
2694111 2695112 Rory!
2695362 2697030 Hey! This is<br />not your house anymore!
2697072 2698365 QUINN: Rory!
2698407 2700993 Hey, buddy. Where are ya?
2701451 2702870 He's not here.
2703203 2704538 What do you mean,<br />he's not here?
2705998 2707165 Oh, shit!
2707207 2709084 What? So we<br />ordered some video games.
2709126 2711086 No! No! No!
2711128 2713380 The whole fucking reason<br />I sent it to a P.O. box,
2713422 2715007 was so<br />I didn't put you in danger.
2715591 2716758 Goddamn it,<br />we need to find him.
2716800 2717968 Wait, Quinn,<br />you're scaring me now.
2718302 2719678 (footsteps)
2721054 2722890 (indistinct chatter)
2728145 2729313 I specifically said
2729354 2731190 no first-person shooter.<br />No combat games.
2731231 2732900 Did you ever think that<br />maybe he plays them
2732941 2734026 to connect with his father?
2734067 2735402 Oh, my God.<br />We're doing this again.
2735444 2737070 Hey! Can you<br />stop taking all my...
2739281 2740699 Who are these people<br />in my house?
2740741 2742868 Emily, loonies.<br />Loonies, Emily.
2742910 2744328 Good evening.
2744369 2745829 Uh, the brushstrokes on this
2745871 2747581 are really dynamic.<br />It's a wonderful piece.
2747623 2749208 Okay, you need<br />to put that down.
2749249 2751126 What exactly is she doing<br />with her right hand?
2751168 2752669 They're my unit.<br />They're soldiers.
2752711 2755005 Marines. There's his unit.<br />(laughing)
2755297 2756590 Hi. You seem like<br />a really nice...
2756632 2758383 Oh, no, don't touch me. No.
2758425 2760594 Hang on. Back up.<br />Your unit?
2760636 2762554 What happened<br />to Haines and Dupree?
2763931 2764973 They're dead.
2765015 2767100 And the thing that killed them<br />is out there looking for Rory.
2767142 2768435 What are you talking about?
2768477 2769561 There's something out there.
2770479 2772481 It tore my friends apart.<br />What is it?
2772523 2773482 (Coyle stuttering)
2773524 2775734 Like, it's a creature.<br />Seriously, it's not a person.
2775776 2776652 Like from the Bible.
2776985 2778487 -Revelations.<br />-From the Bible?
2778529 2780489 That's the most ridiculous<br />thing I've ever heard.
2780531 2781406 It's a space alien.
2782032 2783450 Know who Whoopi Goldberg is?
2783742 2785160 It's like<br />an alien Whoopi Goldberg.
2786161 2787329 Oh, shit!
2787913 2788872 Shit.
2788914 2790249 I want a grid search.
2790290 2791375 Three teams.
2791834 2793043 (men exclaiming)
2793085 2794002 Hey!
2795003 2796964 -No.<br />-No, no, I'm coming with you.
2797005 2798257 QUINN: No, nix that.
2798298 2799550 (gun cocking)
2799591 2801051 (Quinn clears throat)
2802678 2803971 Is there a problem?
2805305 2807182 Thing is, we're<br />kind of moving targets.
2807224 2809643 Yeah, in case you haven't<br />noticed, we're fugitives.
2809685 2811562 Yeah. Plus, like where are we<br />gonna get our meds and stuff?
2811603 2813230 I get it. Fine,<br />stay here and watch TV.
2813272 2816400 You know what? If you try<br />to split? Or draw the Feds?
2816441 2817734 Or if you jeopardize my son
2817776 2819945 by your half-assed<br />yardbird bullshit...
2819987 2821530 I will come back here,<br />and I will happily
2821572 2823282 kill every single<br />fucking one of you.
2829371 2831164 WILLIAMS: Come on,<br />brothers. Let's go.
2831790 2833041 (door closes)
2834042 2835043 Seriously?
2835627 2836962 It's not our fight.
2842009 2843760 Is your husband<br />the man I think he is?
2844845 2845888 Excuse me?
2846805 2848182 Tell me<br />about your husband, please?
2850267 2852144 He's a security<br />counter-sniper.
2852186 2853520 -Mmm.<br />-Army Rangers.
2854730 2855856 He supervised
2855898 2858650 23 close precision engagements<br />across five continents
2858692 2861028 and he has 13 confirmed kills.
2861570 2864364 And he is one of only 14<br />captains in the armed forces,
2864406 2866241 to ever receive<br />a Distinguished Service Medal
2866283 2867409 and the Silver Star.
2868702 2870245 So, he might be<br />a lousy husband,
2870287 2871747 but he is a good soldier.
2873874 2876710 Well, sounds like he can<br />probably take care of himself.
2876752 2878253 -Yeah.<br />-Jesus Christ.
2878295 2879421 That's what I thought.
2880380 2881590 Fucking pussies.
2883425 2885260 (door opens and closes)
2885302 2886470 Where you going, Nettles?
2888430 2890933 I didn't like your speech.<br />It didn't really inspire me.
2891642 2894478 But... he called me a pussy
2894520 2896480 and nobody<br />calls me a pussy, so...
2896522 2898023 -Fuck off, pussy.<br />-Okay...
2898065 2899316 (clears throat)
2902236 2904279 Come on, Bax, let's go.<br />Let's get some.
2904321 2906740 Before these army fuckers<br />screw up the whole thing.
2911078 2912162 Come on, what are you doing?<br />Let's move.
2912204 2913247 Hey!
2913288 2914331 You too, lucky charms.
2914373 2915457 LYNCH: Coyle, you wanker.
2917751 2919002 I'd like to watch TV
2919044 2920379 -with you sometime.<br />-Okay.
2920420 2921547 I liked your speech.
2921588 2922840 BAXLEY: I liked the couch.
2924883 2926802 Whoa, what's happening? What?
2927427 2929513 Well, we're finding my son,<br />that's what.
2930389 2931974 All right,<br />when all this is over...
2932015 2934101 Fuck me in the face<br />with an aardvark.
2934142 2935269 (groaning)
2937271 2938397 I just want to be famous.
2938438 2939398 LYNCH: Ostensibly,
2939439 2941066 if Forrest Gump<br />just read the side of the box,
2941108 2942568 it would tell him exactly<br />what he would get.
2942609 2944236 COYLE: You're using<br />"ostensibly" incorrectly.
2944278 2945362 Is this for me?
2945404 2946905 This is like the reverse<br />of a clown car.
2947322 2948323 All right, Nebraska,
2948365 2949700 let's find some wheels,<br />nothing flashy.
2949741 2950784 Copy.
2950826 2953537 All right. Find my son.
2953829 2955247 Casey, you're with me.
2955747 2956665 Let's go.
2958041 2959376 DEREK: Hey, ass-burger.
2962880 2964339 What are you supposed to be?
2964381 2965591 RORY: Leave me alone.
2965632 2968552 EJ: Or what? You'll wash our<br />hands five hundred times?
2968594 2969720 (snickers)
2970512 2971722 (doorbell rings)
2972055 2973390 RORY: Trick or treat?
2978520 2979938 EJ: What's the matter, dude?
2980272 2981481 (chuckles)
2981523 2983150 Here's a treat,<br />you little shit.
2983609 2984818 -Oh!<br />-(laughs)
2985402 2986570 (helmet whirring)

3012596 3014056 (whimpering)
3021188 3022731 OFFICER (on radio):<br />I got a male juvenile.
3022773 3024316 10 to 12 years old.
3024358 3025609 Metal cast on his arm.
3025651 3026777 Yo, McKenna, do you hear that?
3026818 3028195 OFFICER:<br />Ran right in front of my car.
3029112 3030322 Moving east on Woodruff.
3030364 3032449 Repeat, moving<br />east on Woodruff.
3035911 3037913 (sirens wailing in distance)
3038789 3040541 (panting)
3040874 3042668 Nebraska, you got wheels?
3042709 3044628 WILLIAMS: Yeah, I got wheels.<br />Something flashy.
3046213 3048799 Listen, the kid's spooked,<br />he's rabbiting.
3048841 3051552 Where's he headed?<br />Where's some place he knows?
3055013 3056306 (faint growl)

3146438 3147648 BAXLEY: Oh, shit!

3182349 3183934 BAXLEY: Williams!<br />Get the fuck out of there!
3183976 3185310 (indistinct shouting)
3185769 3187688 COYLE: What are you doing?<br />Get out of there!
3188272 3189439 Oh, shit!
3189690 3191024 (whining)
3193986 3195320 Oh. Okay.
3204413 3206999 WILLIAMS: Doc, the dreads.<br />What's that all about?
3207040 3209585 CASEY: I don't know.<br />Maybe, like, sensor receptors.
3209626 3210794 Kind of like cat whiskers.
3211712 3213839 Whoa! What the--<br />I'm getting a sample.
3213881 3215174 It's a fucking space dog.
3216633 3217676 You okay? Huh?
3218635 3219678 (grunts)
3220470 3222055 What, is your mom<br />cutting your hair now?
3222097 3223140 CASEY: You kidding me?<br />This is

3224683 3225726 All I wanted<br />was a little sample.
3225767 3226685 Please shut up.
3226727 3227853 All I wanted was<br />a goddamn fucking sample.

3914289 3916375 Okay, so, the first Predator,<br />Thing One.
3916667 3918585 Why'd he come here? To Earth?
3918919 3920963 The "Thing One",<br />as you called him,
3921004 3923257 arrived in<br />a hijacked spacecraft.
3923799 3925384 We think there's<br />something on it.
3925801 3927386 Something he didn't want<br />his enemies to have.
3928095 3929221 CASEY: Wait, enemies?
3929596 3931849 Other Predators.<br />Like that big one.
3931890 3934601 So, he brought some what?<br />Gift for the human race?
3934643 3936144 I'll help you find it.<br />We can analyze it...
3936186 3937479 Shut the fuck up!
3941316 3942609 Why are they here?
3944862 3947406 You remember a few years back<br />when Hostess went bust?
3948073 3949950 There was a run on Twinkies?
3950242 3952119 Snapped up<br />from coast-to-coast.
3952160 3953787 Get 'em while they still last.
3954621 3955622 Remember?
3956874 3960002 How long before climate change<br />renders this planet unlivable?
3961420 3962629 Two generations?
3963672 3964840 One?
3964882 3966758 CASEY: That's why their visits<br />are increasing?
3966800 3967968 They're trying to snap up
3968010 3969469 all of our best DNA<br />before we're gone.
3969803 3973015 Adapt themselves with it<br />and then move in.
3973640 3976351 We're an endangered species,<br />and they know it.
3976393 3978020 They thrive<br />in a hothouse environment.
3978395 3980230 Maybe they want<br />to move into ours.
3981148 3982399 And that dead Predator
3982441 3984151 was bringing us<br />a way to stop them.
3985652 3986695 (grunts)
3986737 3989198 You've hidden this thing<br />before in the mail.

3992075 3993493 Your mother's ass.
3993952 3995579 Wait, did I say that out loud?
3996246 3997539 (grunts)
3999458 4002461 Hey! Hey! Hey! No, no, no.<br />That is not for you.
4002503 4003545 That is my son's,

4064731 4066483 Why are we trying<br />to crack the entry code?
4066525 4068485 SAPIR: Because when we do<br />find it, wouldn't it be great
4068527 4069778 if we could<br />get into the fucking thing?
4069820 4070988 What's that?
4071780 4072906 A map.
4073448 4074616 A map to what?

4076910 4078537 maybe we can try<br />to get into it.

4093802 4096054 Hey, Rory, I'm Will.
4096638 4097723 How you doing?

4114156 4115157 Golf tomorrow?
4115532 4116617 Why not?
4117326 4119328 You two never read<br />my file, did ya?
4119953 4121205 What makes you say that?
4121246 4123540 'Cause you two morons<br />are making plans for tomorrow.
4124041 4125125 (laughing)
4125167 4126292 The worst part is,
4126542 4128629 you're making me lie to my son.
4130130 4131715 What lie did you<br />tell him, hmm?
4133091 4134510 That I won't enjoy this.
4135969 4137345 (grunting)
4139014 4140057 (screams)
4140098 4141600 (mouthing)
4143393 4144853 -(gun cocking)<br />-Hey, please, don't.
4145895 4147773 Look, I don't know<br />what they told you...
4147814 4150149 Can you just wait<br />for a second? Just wait!
4150192 4151609 No, no, no!
4152152 4153153 No.
4153403 4154947 (grunting softly)
4158408 4160202 -Jeez!<br />-(yipping)
4160243 4161328 Oh, my God.
4166582 4167584 (retches)
4173256 4174508 (both grunting)
4188313 4189314 (gasping)
4193819 4195195 (grunting)
4198657 4199700 Nebraska!
4199950 4201743 -Yeah?<br />-You just kill somebody?
4201785 4202911 Well, he ain't well.
4202953 4204204 Untie my friend.
4204246 4205622 They got Rory. We gotta move.
4206206 4207499 Shit, they rough you up?
4207875 4209626 Did worse on myself,<br />back in the day.
4209668 4211170 (grunting)
4211211 4212754 What do you want to do<br />with this guy?
4215674 4217342 Sorry, buddy,<br />that was a dumb question.
4217384 4218552 Yeah, that was<br />a dumb question.
4219511 4220971 (panting)
4226476 4227644 (low growling)
4231815 4232816 QUINN: Casey!
4235903 4237905 Can I interest you in getting<br />the fuck out of here?
4238697 4240449 "Getting the fuck out of here"<br />is my middle name.
4241283 4242868 And I thought Gaylord was bad.
4242910 4243952 (Quinn groans)
4243994 4245245 (stomach grumbling)
4245787 4247497 What? What's wrong?
4248248 4249750 (toilet flushing)
4250918 4252753 Whew! All right.
4253003 4255088 Hey! Just let me unpack this.
4255130 4256798 You're saying my son's headed<br />towards a spaceship
4256840 4258133 and so is a 10-foot alien.
4258175 4259510 Uh, 11, actually.
4259551 4260886 Used to be a contractor.
4261178 4262763 This thing is a hybrid?<br />What does that mean?
4262804 4264890 Meaning it's the Chinese menu<br />of DNA.
4264932 4266934 Comprised of the deadliest<br />species in the entire...
4266975 4268227 In the entire universe, yeah?
4268268 4269728 -Galaxy.<br />-What?
4269770 4271813 Galaxy. 250 billion stars.
4271855 4273440 Why go universe? Just saying.
4274024 4275442 (helicopter whirring)
4287538 4289498 Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ!
4289540 4290582 That's what you asked for?
4290624 4291625 Yeah, that'll do.
4293252 4294461 Saddle up!
4298215 4299591 COYLE: It's the best<br />we could do, man.
4302761 4303804 WILLIAMS: Go ahead. Go!
4303846 4305180 That's it? Another one.
4305222 4306348 QUINN: The other one!
4306390 4307850 Come on.<br />Let's go get my kid.
4311353 4313564 Figured something out.<br />I think we're gonna die.
4314648 4316650 We're gonna go hunt and fight<br />the what, the army?
4316692 4317985 COYLE: We're not gonna<br />fight the army...
4318026 4319695 BAXLEY: And some<br />fucking people from space!
4319736 4321196 You wanna talk survival, huh?
4321738 4322823 Fine!
4322865 4324992 You, yesterday,<br />you were on a prison bus
4325033 4326243 barking to yourself,
4326285 4328078 now you got a gun<br />in your hand.
4328120 4329329 Who's a survivor now?
4331206 4332624 We put bullets in our head
4332666 4334126 and walk<br />to the fucking hospital.
4334710 4335794 We're soldiers!
4337421 4338755 Nettles, what's our 20?
4339339 4341008 I can follow<br />your boy's chopper.
4341049 4342301 I locked into its frequency.
4356690 4357816 SOLDIER: Fence is hot!
4375083 4376543 (indistinct radio chatter)
4377920 4379129 What do you say, buddy?
4380088 4381423 You think you can get us<br />in there?
4382299 4384259 Because I'm not sure<br />that you can.
4384801 4386094 Nice reverse psychology.
4386720 4388013 I can do that, too.
4388263 4389473 Don't go fuck yourself.
4390766 4391892 (laughs)
4392893 4394353 TRAEGER: That's good. Come on.
4394853 4397022 Good. Almost up and running.<br />Five minutes.
4397064 4398106 TRAEGER: Right on.
4398148 4399525 It's a translator unit, Rory.
4399858 4401026 Been trying to figure out
4401068 4402361 what these<br />bird-chirping motherfuckers
4402402 4403779 been saying since '87.
4403820 4405531 Gave the Harvard School<br />of Linguistics
4405572 4406907 a billion-dollar grant.
4406949 4409159 Voila. Watch your step,<br />come on.
4421588 4423966 Goddamn, kid, I don't know<br />where you get it from.
4425217 4427010 (trilling)
4451493 4453412 TRAEGER: Put the translator<br />into the mainframe.
4453453 4454621 Download everything.
4461545 4462796 SAPIR: What the hell's<br />inside there?
4463088 4464673 It's property<br />of Project Stargazer.
4464715 4466758 That's what the fuck it is.<br />(laughs)
4468802 4470387 OFFICER (on comms):<br />Code three. Code three.
4470429 4471805 We have motion<br />at the south fence line.
4472264 4473599 Send a fireteam<br />to check it out.
4473932 4476059 That's my dad.<br />He's gonna come save me now.
4476602 4477644 Oh, is he?
4478937 4480314 Is that what he's gonna do?
4481064 4482357 I'll tell you what, buddy...
4483525 4484776 if it is your daddy,
4485194 4486987 and I truly hope that it is...
4487654 4489489 he's gotta be just about
4489531 4492701 the dumbest motherfucker<br />I've ever met. (laughing)
4494912 4498165 I mean, a Ranger sniper<br />tripping wire sensors?
4498207 4499458 He's gotta be...
4501126 4502461 creating a diversion.
4502503 4503879 It's a fucking diversion.
4504338 4505380 (grunts)
4505422 4506715 Oh, shit!
4506757 4508091 Wow. Howdy.
4508342 4510093 What, are you gonna kill us<br />with a fucking tranq gun?
4510802 4512429 You took my boy, so yeah.
4513138 4514139 Told you.
4515057 4516058 Take this, son.
4516600 4519102 You outta your mind? We<br />literally have you surrounded.
4519144 4520562 That's why<br />you're coming with me.
4520604 4522147 I just want the boy.<br />Nobody's got to die.
4522189 4523065 Dad?
4525651 4527110 From here forward.
4527152 4528612 Don't look at the dead guy.
4542960 4544294 (grunting)
4549216 4550509 That was pretty good.
4550551 4551718 You all right? Did I get you?
4551760 4552761 No, I'm good.
4553679 4554847 Welcome back.
4554888 4556014 Fuck you. I never left.
4559017 4560185 You open your mouth,
4560227 4562020 I'm gonna blow your brains<br />right through it.
4562062 4563230 Come on, just get behind me.
4563730 4565357 SOLDIER (on radio):<br />All units. They got Traeger.
4565399 4566441 They got Traeger.
4567985 4569152 (softly) Let's go. Let's go.
4569820 4571488 Just tell them<br />to put the guns down.
4581248 4582291 Tell them!
4584209 4585669 If Captain McKenna<br />doesn't lower his weapon
4585711 4586670 in the next 10 seconds...
4587004 4588714 shoot the kid's knees out.<br />That work for you?
4588755 4590090 Oh, that's a really bad idea.
4590424 4592718 My guys got this place covered<br />on every angle.
4592759 4594428 That's a funny story.<br />See, I don't give a shit.
4594469 4595387 10.
4596722 4597764 Nine.
4598473 4599474 Eight.
4600851 4601852 Seven.
4602519 4604438 Come on, you just give<br />the fucking word, man.
4604479 4605522 TRAEGER: Six. Five.
4605564 4607024 (predator clicking)

4616033 4617701 (yelling)
4620829 4622247 -(distant yelling)<br />-Oh, shit!
4622706 4623999 (grunting)
4624041 4625125 Come on, son!
4626251 4627711 (indistinct shouting)
4627753 4628795 Take them down!
4634927 4636053 Get down, sir.
4636094 4637596 Let's go, son. Go!
4637638 4638805 SOLDIER: Come on. Come on.
4644770 4646396 Okay, take this. (spits)
4647814 4648857 You wanna vanish,
4648899 4650442 you really vanish, son,<br />you understand?
4650817 4653111 All right, we're going home.<br />I promise you.
4658408 4659660 (predator growls)
4662996 4663997 It's here.
4670712 4672214 -(predator growls)<br />-No! No! No!
4678387 4679847 SOLDIER 2: Come on,<br />go around the end there!
4680264 4681431 Stay on him!<br />Stay on him!
4681807 4683100 Move, move, move!
4683141 4684518 -You got him?<br />-SOLDIER 3: Yeah!
4696071 4697656 -(explosion)<br />-QUINN: Stay back.
4697698 4698866 Get down! Get down!
4701410 4705289 SOLDIER 4: Cease fire!<br />Cease fire! Cease fire!
4714590 4716800 (low growling)
4717301 4719136 (both panting quietly)
4732065 4733442 -COYLE: Huh?<br />-All right.
4733942 4735027 Hey, McKenna.
4735277 4737946 Be reasonable. There's six<br />of you, seven of us.
4738739 4739823 (grunts)
4740073 4741200 Fuck!
4741241 4742701 Who taught you math?
4742993 4744995 You ain't the only<br />fucking sniper, white boy.
4746955 4749082 You can walk away<br />from this, Captain.
4749791 4751293 I just want the ship.
4751335 4753545 -Dad, he's lying.<br />-Yeah.
4753587 4755881 McKenna! I don't like this.
4756340 4757591 What's he doing in there?
4759635 4760928 (predator warbling)
4762262 4764515 -(loud warbling)<br />-(feedback whines)
4766225 4768310 (all groan)
4769478 4771104 It's using the translator.
4773357 4775317 PREDATOR (over speaker):<br />Hello. I have enjoyed
4775567 4777027 watching you kill each other.
4777528 4779821 I came here<br />to destroy this vessel.
4780197 4781907 You cannot have it.
4781949 4784117 What you can do is run.
4784785 4787704 I detect one among you<br />who is a true warrior.
4788163 4790040 The one called McKenna.
4792084 4793377 He will be your leader.
4794127 4795379 He will be my prize.
4795796 4797631 I offer time advantage.
4798590 4799591 Go.
4800050 4801552 What the fuck<br />is time advantage?
4801593 4802678 Like a head start?
4803762 4805931 (alarm sounding)
4806306 4807766 I'm gonna wake up on a bus.
4808725 4810018 I'm gonna wake up on a bus.
4812980 4813981 Hey!
4814398 4815440 I'm coming out!
4825117 4826118 We're in.
4827035 4828579 -Baxley!<br />-Shit!
4828620 4830706 Watch where the fuck you're<br />throwing, dickhead.
4830747 4832124 -(vehicle engine stalling)<br />-Will do.
4833041 4835252 Okay, so we split up.<br />12 different directions.
4835294 4837129 -McKenna's the one he wants.<br />-TRAEGER: No, no, no!
4837171 4839464 We stay together,<br />or it'll take us one by one.
4839506 4841008 He's right. It's their MO.
4841049 4843010 -Grow a dick, will you?<br />-SOLDIER: Nothing's starting!
4843051 4845137 Son of a bitch. He must have<br />hacked the vehicles.
4845387 4847598 If we can get to the helicopter,<br />go two klicks north.
4847639 4848682 -Got you.<br />-Hey?
4848724 4850767 When this is over, you and me,<br />we're gonna dance.
4850809 4851977 I got my shoes all picked out.
4852019 4853020 All right.
4859067 4860861 (soft growling)
4861111 4862946 -Fuck.<br />-No, no, no! Don't.
4863864 4865741 Here, boy. Fetch.
4866950 4868410 -(creature barks)<br />-Here, boy. (whistles)
4868452 4869453 Here you go.
4872414 4873874 That was a valuable weapon.
4875959 4877669 Let's go.<br />He'll be coming for us.
4878629 4880339 (alarm blaring)
4904488 4905906 (warbling)
4906198 4907199 (device beeps)
4916416 4917751 Give me the goody bag.
4919419 4921964 Hey. On Halloween,<br />this blew up a whole house.
4922005 4923715 -How do you shoot it?<br />-You don't.
4923757 4925801 It just fires by itself<br />when it's being attacked.
4925843 4927302 Seriously? Oh, shit.
4929012 4930556 (man coughing)
4931807 4933600 (faint rustling)
4935769 4937145 I heard something.
4937187 4939314 TRAEGER: Hey, man.<br />That's Predator technology.
4940524 4941692 Fuck.
4941733 4943318 That-- It's gonna come back.
4943360 4945112 You got, uh, a catcher<br />on the wrist.
4945821 4946947 That's gonna come back.
4948448 4949449 No!
4950492 4952369 -(screaming)<br />-Quiet. Quiet.
4953370 4955080 -Let me see. Let me see.<br />-My fucking hand.
4955122 4956498 -Shit.<br />-My fucking hand.
4958876 4959960 Gotta be quiet.
4965215 4966258 (screaming)
4970637 4972097 (predator warbles)
4978812 4979938 Moving!
4996079 4998165 No, no, no!<br />This way. This way. This way.
4999541 5000876 There's a clearing up ahead.
5001335 5003462 Lynch left some pyro up there.<br />To cover our retreat.
5003504 5005214 Let's find it<br />and trap the motherfucker.
5005255 5007633 You guys go set it up.<br />We'll lure him in.
5008008 5009593 -Who?<br />-You and me.
5009635 5010636 Yeah? All right.
5010969 5012471 -Yeah.<br />-Let's go.
5013514 5014515 Come on.
5016433 5017976 Can I talk to you<br />for a second?
5018018 5019269 What's this "we" shit?
5019311 5020646 What, are you gonna<br />live forever, Coyle?
5020687 5022231 -Just calm down.<br />-COYLE: Calm down?
5022272 5025150 Me, calm down?<br />Yeah, okay, thanks, twitchy.
5025192 5027194 Move, move, move!<br />Up here. Up, up, up.
5044878 5046296 (owl hooting)
5049424 5051218 -(indistinct animal croaking)<br />-Shit!
5054012 5055097 Okay, fuck this.
5056431 5057850 Hey! Asshole!
5058350 5059393 What the fuck was that?
5059726 5061103 COYLE: It's a chance for you<br />to survive.
5061979 5063063 Go! I got this.
5063438 5065232 That's the stupidest fucking<br />thing I've ever heard.
5071697 5073323 Come and get us, asshole!

5804805 5805889 He loves it here.
5806181 5807975 Yeah, he's something else.<br />What do we got, Doctor?
5808016 5810102 Well, I assume<br />that you know by now,
5810477 5813063 but the first Predator,<br />it didn't come here to hunt us.
5813355 5815232 -He brought something.<br />-Exactly.
5815274 5816692 Now, you want<br />to hear the good news?
5817985 5819236 The cargo survived.
5820195 5821822 With some sort of fail-safe.
5821864 5823907 Before the upgrade Predator<br />blew up the ship,
5824199 5825450 a pod escaped.
5825492 5826952 Jettisoned.<br />Saved itself.
5828287 5831623 It seems that our boy<br />wasn't taking any chances.

5899566 5901735 -Rory, what's in that pod?<br />-Don't know!
5903278 5904821 Oh, wow... Oh, shit!

5908909 5910327 the Predator Killer.
5910744 5912621 -QUINN: Get him out of here!<br />-Come with me. Let's go.

5949116 5951368 Whatever it is,<br />it appears to be dormant.
5951952 5954288 -I assume it needs to be...<br />-(women gasp)
5954329 5956790 SOLDIER: Eyes on.<br />Keep your weapons trained.
5957207 5959585 (gasps) Get it off!<br />Get it off me!
5959918 5961920 (screaming)
5992659 5994036 What the hell is that?
5994494 5996079 That's my new suit, bubba.
5998498 6000292 I hope they got it<br />in a 42 long.
