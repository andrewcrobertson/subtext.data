158283 159742 You two morons<br />really making bets
159909 162620 on whether a drug cartel<br />has executed these hostages?

745286 747371 Does, uh, Quinn McKenna<br />live here?

752418 753711 Department of Defense.

760551 761927 Military designation.
762344 764555 -Ah.<br />-He kills people...
766098 767475 so you can be a mailman.
774648 776609 (dogs barking)
781113 782198 Dr. Brackett?
789413 792249 I understand<br />you enjoy stargazing?
795044 796462 My men<br />will take care of your dog.
796587 797755 Will you come with me, please?
809475 810518 What am I looking at?
812186 814313 It's exactly<br />what you think it is. Yeah.
816816 818400 They've been here before.
818609 820778 '87. '97.
823030 826534 Lately, the visits<br />are increasing in frequency.
837294 840381 EMILY: Rory, I'm home!<br />Hey, I got you something.
841590 842591 Hey.
846095 848097 Did you do<br />one of these after school?
848472 849723 I did all of them.
850516 852101 Oh. Okay.
852810 856063 Well, I got you two options.
857273 858399 We have...
859233 861193 pirate, or...
863654 864697 Frankenstein.
867199 868951 Frankenstein,<br />you know, green skin?
869577 871370 Threw a girl<br />to see if she would float?
873497 874498 No. Okay.
874665 876876 Well, let's go with pirate.<br />Yeah?
877501 878544 This is dumb.
880004 881630 The guys will...
882590 884049 They will still<br />be able to see.
885426 886468 See what?
887428 888470 That it's me.
891056 893100 PSYCHOLOGIST: You were once<br />quoted as saying,
893183 895227 "I dropped<br />from my mother's womb...
895519 897229 I hit the floor...
897688 898981 and I started crawling
899064 901400 through hostile territory<br />toward my grave."
901567 903402 (laughing)
903736 904778 QUINN: <i>About right, yeah.</i>
904862 906780 -That's badass.<br />-It's pretty morbid.
906947 908032 It's pretty dark.
908866 911535 What's with the polygraph?
911619 912912 I thought<br />this was a psych eval.
913287 915247 We need to know<br />if you pose a threat.
915414 916582 Oh, I'm a sniper.
917416 919501 Isn't posing a threat<br />kind of the fucking point?
920336 923380 You spend most of your time<br />now in-country...
923797 925758 estranged from your wife<br />and son?
929053 930346 (sighs)
931722 933098 Look, I get it.
933849 936894 Something went down in Mexico<br />and nobody wants any witnesses.
937061 937937 Excuse me?
938395 940689 You're not here<br />to find out if I'm crazy.
941315 943275 You wanna make sure<br />the label sticks.
943484 944944 So, you feel<br />you're being railroaded?
945235 947488 I can see the tracks<br />on the floor!
949156 950908 I don't see tracks<br />on the floor, for the record.
951241 952826 You feel<br />like you're a stranger
952910 954328 on your own planet,<br />don't you, Captain?
956038 958165 Like an alien, you mean?
961543 963087 That's what you wanted.
965506 966882 <i>Do I get a cookie now?</i>
967633 968759 He saw something.
968842 969927 -Oh, yeah.<br />-Yeah.
1015556 1016932 Wow!
1029611 1030696 Ow.

1050924 1053635 (device trilling)
1058891 1060434 (exhales deeply)
1061810 1063979 You shove me again,<br />I'm gonna break your neck.
1064813 1066148 Did I say that out loud?
1070569 1072112 -(Quinn clears throat)<br />-McKenna.
1074990 1075991 OFFICER: Last one.
1076158 1077659 Thanks for your kindness.<br />Thank you.
1083457 1084625 (sighs)
1086919 1088128 (keys jangling)
1095469 1096470 Oh, yeah?
1099264 1100307 (Baxley mumbles)
1101475 1103060 (clicks and sniffs)
1103977 1105104 You all right over there?
1105229 1106939 No, don't worry about him.<br />He's just got Tourettes.
1107106 1108941 -He can't control it.<br />-Fuck you, Coyle.
1109108 1110526 You get used to it, bro.
1115864 1117366 Welcome to Group Two.
1117533 1118826 Oh, yeah? What's that?
1118992 1119993 Like a unit?
1120160 1121787 No, group. Group Two.
1122079 1123747 Group therapy, room two.
1124957 1125999 Oh.
1126208 1127751 -McKenna.<br />-Nebraska Williams.
1127918 1128919 That's your real name?
1129086 1130129 Gaylord.
1130295 1132131 -That's a good call, then.<br />-Yeah, I thought so.
1132381 1133632 (chuckles)
1133715 1135008 Where did you serve?
1135592 1137511 Operation<br />Enduring Freedom, '03.
1138178 1140848 Went for the Taliban,<br />stayed for the opium.
1141807 1142933 (laughing)
1144935 1147229 That's Coyle.<br />Friendly fire incident.
1147604 1150190 Got turned around, fired<br />at one of his own vehicles.
1151400 1152609 Now, he tells jokes.
1152693 1153777 (Coyle clears throat)
1153861 1155988 -(thuds)<br />-(grunts) That's Lynch.
1156446 1158532 Got a medal for blowing up<br />half a mountain in Mosul.
1159158 1160409 Entropy.
1161201 1162452 That's my game.
1162995 1164621 Things like to fall apart
1164746 1166790 and I... make it happen.
1168000 1169668 Just... Just like that.
1169835 1172087 -(gasping)<br />-Ooh! Wow! Oh.
1173213 1174965 -Hey.<br />-Hey. Don't.
1176967 1177968 Don't.
1178302 1179469 That's Nettles.
1179803 1181889 (stutters) Okay, I'm Nettles.
1182264 1183891 Did three tours flying Hueys.
1184057 1186185 He loves his Bible.<br />Hey, Netty?
1186351 1187853 Is it end times yet?
1188020 1189396 Yeah, laugh all you want.
1189521 1191481 But when you're standing at<br />attention before your Maker...
1191565 1193400 I always stand at attention<br />before I make her.
1193609 1195194 -(whistles)<br />-(laughter)
1195360 1196904 God makes shitty people.
1197571 1198572 Yeah.
1198697 1200824 I mean, why do you think<br />people make war?
1200991 1202326 Why, Baxley?<br />Why do we make war?
1202492 1204745 -Come on, Baxley!<br />-Because fuck-cock-cock!
1204912 1206830 -Because we fuck cock-cock?<br />-Yes, we fuck cocks.
1206914 1208123 That's it,<br />because we fuck cocks,
1208207 1209499 that's why. We get upset.
1209875 1212085 How'd you snag a ticket<br />on this shitmobile?
1212753 1214254 Put a bullet in a CO.
1215297 1216757 Any particular reason?
1218508 1219718 He was an asshole.
1242866 1244159 Keep your head down.
1252626 1253794 Here, throw this on.
1258757 1260050 (bell rings)
1262177 1263929 Is it just your imagination?
1264346 1267432 Or is this haunted room<br />actually stretching?
1269017 1270227 Every fucking time?
1271270 1272521 (elevator dings)
1272938 1274606 AUTOMATED VOICE:<br /><i>Your attention, please.</i>
1274773 1278235 <i>The GRC meeting has been moved</i><br /><i>to section 3, room A.</i>
1278402 1280487 Aha! There you are!
1281822 1284324 Welcome.<br />I'm Sean Keyes.
1284992 1286910 Wow. I heard you basically<br />wrote the book
1286994 1288287 on evolutionary biology.
1288453 1290122 Um, I'm sorry, can I just...
1290414 1291498 Is that...?
1294293 1295752 Oh, my God!
1297337 1299798 (chuckles nervously)<br />Holy shit.
1300299 1301842 That's alien technology.
1304177 1305804 This is what<br />you brought me here to see?
1306555 1308181 KEYES: Well, yeah.
1308974 1311518 Can I... Can I see this?<br />Can I get into this?
1311893 1312894 Doc.
1313645 1314688 Let's go.
1314896 1316982 (indistinct PA announcement)
1327617 1329328 -TRAEGER: <i>Everything good?</i><br /><i>-Yes, sir.</i>
1330537 1331747 TRAEGER: <i>What is it?</i>
1333749 1334833 <i>Dr. Brackett.</i>
1335459 1337169 <i>Would you like</i><br /><i>to meet a Predator?</i>
1337919 1339296 (chuckles) <i>Come on.</i>
1347846 1349139 WOMAN (on PA):<br /><i>Please observe</i>
1349264 1351058 <i>decontamination protocol.</i>
1351767 1353685 KEYES: So, how'd they<br />rope you into this?
1354061 1356146 I wrote a letter to<br />the president when I was six.
1356313 1357647 Told him how much<br />I loved animals,
1357731 1359274 and that if NASA<br />ever found a space animal,
1359566 1360776 they should call me.
1361234 1363737 Couple years ago,<br />I was put on a short list
1363904 1365655 for a paper<br />I wrote on hybrid strains.
1365947 1369326 Computer cross-referenced<br />the letter, and... here I am.
1371036 1372454 (machine whirring)
1377084 1378251 Dr. Brackett.
1379336 1380670 Thanks for coming.
1380837 1382130 I'm sure you have questions.
1382464 1384966 -Oh. Just two, actually.<br />-Okay.
1385467 1386927 Why do you call it<br />"the Predator"?
1387719 1389179 It's a nickname.
1389971 1392682 You know, the data suggests<br />that it tracks its prey.
1392933 1394267 Exploits weakness.
1394559 1395977 Seems to...
1396561 1397646 well, enjoy it.
1397938 1399147 Like a game.
1399314 1401233 That's not a predator,<br />that's a sports hunter.
1401316 1402192 Sorry?
1402484 1404611 A predator<br />kills its prey to survive.
1404778 1408490 I mean, what you're describing<br />is more like a bass fisherman.
1408657 1410534 Well, we took a vote.<br />Predator's cooler, right?
1410659 1412536 -SAPIR: Fuck yeah.<br />-Fuck yeah.
1412828 1414579 Found his escape pod<br />in Mexico.
1414746 1416415 Still looking<br />for the ship he came in.
1417290 1418708 He's heavily sedated.
1424548 1426800 You are<br />one beautiful motherfucker.
1427843 1430595 I'm gonna guess your second<br />question is, why are you here?
1432848 1435934 Our test results yielded<br />something a little... odd.
1437769 1439312 (scoffs) Is this a joke?
1439980 1442065 KEYES: We ran the genome<br />sequence ten times.
1442566 1443984 This specimen has...
1444151 1445652 -Human DNA?<br />-Yeah.
1445861 1446862 Yeah.
1446945 1449781 Look, we know<br />about spontaneous speciation.
1449865 1451283 Mostly plants and insects,<br />but...
1451450 1454077 But some mammals,<br />sheep, goats, uh...
1454161 1455036 Yeah.
1455162 1456746 KEYES: The red wolf<br />is known to be a hybrid

2456036 2457538 WILLIAMS: Oh, she pulled...
2457621 2460708 Oh! Shit, I told you<br />she'd pull the trigger!
2460791 2462001 I should have bet you<br />that time!
2462084 2463210 WILLIAMS: I like her.<br />I like her.
2463294 2464378 I should have bet you<br />that time!
2464462 2465671 -I like her.<br />-NETTLES: I like her.
2465796 2467047 I like her. I like her a lot.
2467214 2468466 QUINN: Give me that,<br />ding-dong.
2468632 2471385 COYLE: Oh, shit! Attagirl.
2471677 2474763 What? You're a scientist, huh?<br />What they got you working on?
2475639 2477683 You're not gonna last a day<br />out there!
2479935 2481604 What, you think you're special?
2482188 2484482 Back at the dam, they were gonna<br />put a bullet in your head.
2485065 2486192 They were gonna shoot her?
2486358 2487359 Yes.
2487985 2489278 Oh, I'm sorry.
2489778 2491822 Get out of the way.<br />See you around.
2494158 2495659 (stutters) Eat your pussy.
2496243 2497328 Wait, what?
2497495 2498704 How you doing?
2498871 2500206 No, you just said,<br />"Eat your pussy."
2500372 2501290 Hey...
2501373 2503042 -How you doing?<br />-No, you said, "Eat my pussy."
2503125 2504210 What the fuck<br />is wrong with him?
2504418 2506003 -I said you're pushy.<br />-He said you're pushy.
2506086 2507087 No, you said,<br />"Eat your pussy."
2507171 2508756 No. I said,<br />"Sheesh! You're pushy!"
2508881 2510090 CASEY: No, you said,<br />"Eat my pussy."
2510174 2511467 No, that's what he said,<br />I heard it.
2511550 2513177 -He said... pushy.<br />-What the fuck?
2513344 2514929 Which is also fucking rude.
2515012 2516388 He doesn't mean your pussy<br />in particular.
2516555 2517932 You're insane, right?
2518015 2519266 -Are you fucking insane?<br />-COYLE: Probably.
2519433 2520434 Well, what's it gonna be?
2520559 2522102 -BAXLEY: He's fucking crazy.<br />-NETTLES: Fuck you, Baxley.
2522186 2523229 BAXLEY: I feel fine.
2523854 2525022 CASEY: They were gonna<br />shoot me?
2525648 2526649 Why?
2527191 2530653 Uh, maybe 'cause of this?
2535658 2536992 Well, I guess I'm in.
2538369 2539912 Stay the fuck away from me.
2543415 2544625 What the fuck is this?
2545751 2546961 What is this?
2547169 2549463 -What is that? Like a unicorn?<br />-NETTLES: A unicorn.
2549630 2550965 -It's a unicorn.<br />-A unicorn.
2551257 2552758 I made a unicorn...
2552883 2554468 I'm sorry,<br />it's a piece of shit.
2554635 2557304 So, what's the upside to me<br />staying here with you guys?
2557471 2559056 Uh, maybe staying alive?
2559223 2560474 We are soldiers.
2560599 2561767 We're the good guys, okay?
2561892 2563185 CASEY: Well, that's debatable.
2563310 2567273 I read your file.<br />The guys in Mexico it killed?
2567398 2568440 They yours?
2568983 2570401 They're gonna need<br />a patsy for that.
2570484 2571652 You're looking at him.
2571902 2573112 Yeah, I figured.
2573279 2575573 Ex-sniper with PTSD? That's<br />actually kind of perfect.
2575739 2576991 How about you telling us
2577283 2578909 what you were doing<br />in a secret base.
2579076 2581912 Surrounded by<br />trained soldiers. Mercs.
2583497 2587126 I'm a biologist, and they have<br />me on call in case there's...
2589086 2590170 contact.
2591755 2592840 What did I tell you?
2593007 2594675 End days. End days.
2594883 2596302 Nettles, if you don't stop<br />with this Bible shit,
2596427 2597553 I'm gonna set you on fire.
2597720 2599138 Guys, if we wanna<br />keep breathing,
2599221 2600764 we need to find this thing.
2600973 2602057 Expose it.
2602850 2604226 It's called the Predator.
2604727 2606228 It hunts people for sport.
2606353 2608564 Technically, that's not<br />a predator. That's like...
2608647 2609648 Thank you.
2609773 2611191 -It's a hunter.<br />-I said the same thing.
2611317 2612860 NETTLES: A sportsman,<br />or a hunter, or a fisherman.
2612943 2613944 COYLE: Well, look at you...
2614069 2616196 I was there when it escaped.<br />It's looking for something.
2616822 2618657 Equipment. Weapons.
2621327 2622578 I took its gear.
2623662 2624538 What?
2624705 2625873 You took something<br />from the thing?
2625956 2627750 -What?<br />-So, I'd have evidence.
2629335 2630878 I think I know<br />where it's going.
2634798 2636342 (whirring)
2662576 2663702 (growls)
2664495 2665621 What?
2676215 2678425 (indistinct chattering)
2684223 2685766 (door opens)
2689269 2691063 Oh, hi, honey, you're home.
2691772 2693941 -I'm looking for a package.<br />-A package?
2694108 2695109 Rory!
2695359 2696902 Hey! This is<br />not your house anymore!
2697069 2698237 QUINN: Rory!
2698404 2700989 Hey, buddy. Where are ya?
2701448 2702866 He's not here.
2703200 2704535 What do you mean,<br />he's not here?
2705994 2707037 Oh, shit!
2707204 2708956 What? So we<br />ordered some video games.
2709123 2710958 No! No! No!
2711125 2713252 The whole fucking reason<br />I sent it to a P.O. box,
2713419 2715003 was so<br />I didn't put you in danger.
2715587 2716714 Goddamn it,<br />we need to find him.
2716797 2717965 Wait, Quinn,<br />you're scaring me now.
2718298 2719675 (footsteps)
2721051 2722886 (indistinct chatter)
2728142 2729268 I specifically said
2729351 2731061 no first-person shooter.<br />No combat games.
2731228 2732855 Did you ever think that<br />maybe he plays them
2732938 2733981 to connect with his father?
2734064 2735274 Oh, my God.<br />We're doing this again.
2735441 2737067 Hey! Can you<br />stop taking all my...
2739278 2740654 Who are these people<br />in my house?
2740738 2742740 Emily, loonies.<br />Loonies, Emily.
2742906 2744199 Good evening.
2744366 2745784 Uh, the brushstrokes on this
2745868 2747453 are really dynamic.<br />It's a wonderful piece.
2747619 2749079 Okay, you need<br />to put that down.
2749246 2751039 What exactly is she doing<br />with her right hand?
2751165 2752499 They're my unit.<br />They're soldiers.
2752708 2755002 Marines. There's his unit.<br />(laughing)
2755294 2756503 Hi. You seem like<br />a really nice...
2756628 2758255 Oh, no, don't touch me. No.
2758422 2760549 Hang on. Back up.<br />Your unit?
2760632 2762551 What happened<br />to Haines and Dupree?
2763927 2764928 They're dead.
2765012 2766972 And the thing that killed them<br />is out there looking for Rory.
2767139 2768390 What are you talking about?
2768474 2769558 There's something out there.
2770476 2772436 It tore my friends apart.<br />What is it?
2772519 2773437 (Coyle stuttering)
2773520 2775606 Like, it's a creature.<br />Seriously, it's not a person.
2775773 2776648 Like from the Bible.
2776982 2778442 -Revelations.<br />-From the Bible?
2778525 2780402 That's the most ridiculous<br />thing I've ever heard.
2780527 2781403 It's a space alien.
2782029 2783447 Know who Whoopi Goldberg is?
2783739 2785157 It's like<br />an alien Whoopi Goldberg.
2786158 2787326 Oh, shit!
2787910 2788827 Shit.
2788911 2790120 I want a grid search.
2790287 2791371 Three teams.
2791830 2792915 (men exclaiming)
2793081 2793999 Hey!
2795000 2796835 -No.<br />-No, no, I'm coming with you.
2797002 2798212 QUINN: No, nix that.
2798295 2799463 (gun cocking)
2799588 2801048 (Quinn clears throat)
2802674 2803967 Is there a problem?
2805302 2807054 Thing is, we're<br />kind of moving targets.
2807221 2809556 Yeah, in case you haven't<br />noticed, we're fugitives.
2809681 2811517 Yeah. Plus, like where are we<br />gonna get our meds and stuff?
2811600 2813101 I get it. Fine,<br />stay here and watch TV.
2813268 2816271 You know what? If you try<br />to split? Or draw the Feds?
2816438 2817606 Or if you jeopardize my son
2817773 2819858 by your half-assed<br />yardbird bullshit...
2819983 2821485 I will come back here,<br />and I will happily
2821568 2823278 kill every single<br />fucking one of you.
2829368 2831161 WILLIAMS: Come on,<br />brothers. Let's go.
2831787 2833038 (door closes)
2834039 2835040 Seriously?
2835624 2836959 It's not our fight.
2842005 2843757 Is your husband<br />the man I think he is?
2844842 2845884 Excuse me?
2846802 2848178 Tell me<br />about your husband, please?
2850264 2852099 He's a security<br />counter-sniper.
2852182 2853517 -Mmm.<br />-Army Rangers.
2854726 2855811 He supervised
2855894 2858522 23 close precision engagements<br />across five continents
2858689 2861024 and he has 13 confirmed kills.
2861567 2864278 And he is one of only 14<br />captains in the armed forces,
2864403 2866196 to ever receive<br />a Distinguished Service Medal
2866280 2867406 and the Silver Star.
2868699 2870200 So, he might be<br />a lousy husband,
2870284 2871743 but he is a good soldier.
2873871 2876582 Well, sounds like he can<br />probably take care of himself.
2876748 2878125 -Yeah.<br />-Jesus Christ.
2878292 2879418 That's what I thought.
2880377 2881587 Fucking pussies.
2883422 2885173 (door opens and closes)
2885299 2886466 Where you going, Nettles?
2888427 2890929 I didn't like your speech.<br />It didn't really inspire me.
2891638 2894349 But... he called me a pussy
2894516 2896393 and nobody<br />calls me a pussy, so...
2896518 2897978 -Fuck off, pussy.<br />-Okay...
2898061 2899313 (clears throat)
2902232 2904192 Come on, Bax, let's go.<br />Let's get some.
2904318 2906737 Before these army fuckers<br />screw up the whole thing.
2911074 2912117 Come on, what are you doing?<br />Let's move.
2912200 2913118 Hey!
2913285 2914286 You too, lucky charms.
2914369 2915454 LYNCH: Coyle, you wanker.
2917748 2918957 I'd like to watch TV
2919041 2920250 -with you sometime.<br />-Okay.
2920417 2921418 I liked your speech.
2921585 2922836 BAXLEY: I liked the couch.
2924880 2926798 Whoa, what's happening? What?
2927424 2929509 Well, we're finding my son,<br />that's what.
2930385 2931803 All right,<br />when all this is over...
2932012 2934056 Fuck me in the face<br />with an aardvark.
2934139 2935265 (groaning)
2937267 2938352 I just want to be famous.
2938435 2939353 LYNCH: Ostensibly,
2939436 2941021 if Forrest Gump<br />just read the side of the box,
2941104 2942522 it would tell him exactly<br />what he would get.
2942606 2944191 COYLE: You're using<br />"ostensibly" incorrectly.
2944274 2945275 Is this for me?
2945400 2946902 This is like the reverse<br />of a clown car.
2947319 2948278 All right, Nebraska,
2948362 2949655 let's find some wheels,<br />nothing flashy.
2949738 2950739 Copy.
2950822 2953533 All right. Find my son.
2953825 2955243 Casey, you're with me.
2955744 2956662 Let's go.
2958038 2959373 DEREK: Hey, ass-burger.
2962876 2964211 What are you supposed to be?
2964378 2965462 RORY: Leave me alone.
2965629 2968507 EJ: Or what? You'll wash our<br />hands five hundred times?
2968590 2969716 (snickers)
2970509 2971718 (doorbell rings)
2972052 2973387 RORY: Trick or treat?
2978517 2979935 EJ: What's the matter, dude?
2980268 2981395 (chuckles)
2981520 2983146 Here's a treat,<br />you little shit.

3046209 3048670 Listen, the kid's spooked,<br />he's rabbiting.

3193982 3195317 Oh. Okay.
3204409 3206870 WILLIAMS: Doc, the dreads.<br />What's that all about?
3207037 3209456 CASEY: I don't know.<br />Maybe, like, sensor receptors.
3209623 3210790 Kind of like cat whiskers.
3211708 3213710 Whoa! What the--<br />I'm getting a sample.
3213877 3215170 It's a fucking space dog.
3216630 3217672 You okay? Huh?

3224679 3225680 All I wanted<br />was a little sample.
3225764 3226640 Please shut up.

3961415 3962625 Two generations?
3963668 3964710 One?
3964877 3966712 CASEY: That's why their visits<br />are increasing?
3966796 3967922 They're trying to snap up
3968005 3969465 all of our best DNA<br />before we're gone.
3969799 3973010 Adapt themselves with it<br />and then move in.
3973636 3976222 We're an endangered species,<br />and they know it.
3976389 3978015 They thrive<br />in a hothouse environment.
3978391 3980226 Maybe they want<br />to move into ours.
3981143 3982353 And that dead Predator

4073444 4074445 A map to what?
4074653 4076655 CRYPTOGRAPHER:<i> ...give us</i><br /><i>a clue of where this place is,</i>
4076906 4078365 <i>maybe we can try</i><br /><i>to get into it.</i>
4078574 4080493 <i>But if you don't give us</i><br /><i>anything, we can't get in!</i>
4089043 4090044 (grunts)
4092338 4093547 (whimpering)
4093798 4096050 Hey, Rory, I'm Will.
4096634 4097718 How you doing?
4098219 4100137 I understand you know<br />where the spaceship is.
4114151 4115152 Golf tomorrow?
4115528 4116612 Why not?
4117321 4119323 You two never read<br />my file, did ya?
4119949 4121075 What makes you say that?
4121242 4123536 'Cause you two morons<br />are making plans for tomorrow.
4124036 4125079 (laughing)
4125162 4126288 The worst part is,
4126539 4128624 you're making me lie to my son.
4130126 4131710 What lie did you<br />tell him, hmm?
4133087 4134505 That I won't enjoy this.
4135965 4137341 (grunting)
4139009 4140010 (screams)
4140094 4141595 (mouthing)
4143389 4144849 -(gun cocking)<br />-Hey, please, don't.
4145891 4147643 Look, I don't know<br />what they told you...
4147810 4149979 Can you just wait<br />for a second? Just wait!
4150187 4151605 No, no, no!
4152148 4153149 No.
4153399 4154942 (grunting softly)
4158404 4160156 -Jeez!<br />-(yipping)
4160239 4161323 Oh, my God.
4166579 4167580 (retches)
4173252 4174503 (both grunting)
4188309 4189310 (gasping)
4193814 4195191 (grunting)
4198652 4199695 Nebraska!
4199945 4201655 -Yeah?<br />-You just kill somebody?
4201780 4202781 Well, he ain't well.
4202948 4204074 Untie my friend.
4204241 4205618 They got Rory. We gotta move.
4206202 4207494 Shit, they rough you up?
4207870 4209580 Did worse on myself,<br />back in the day.
4209663 4211081 (grunting)
4211207 4212750 What do you want to do<br />with this guy?
4215669 4217213 Sorry, buddy,<br />that was a dumb question.
4217379 4218547 Yeah, that was<br />a dumb question.
4219506 4220966 (panting)
4226472 4227640 (low growling)
4231810 4232811 QUINN: Casey!
4235898 4237900 Can I interest you in getting<br />the fuck out of here?
4238692 4240444 "Getting the fuck out of here"<br />is my middle name.
4241278 4242821 And I thought Gaylord was bad.
4242905 4243906 (Quinn groans)
4243989 4245241 (stomach grumbling)
4245783 4247493 What? What's wrong?
4248244 4249745 (toilet flushing)
4250913 4252748 Whew! All right.
4252998 4254959 Hey! Just let me unpack this.
4255125 4256752 You're saying my son's headed<br />towards a spaceship
4256835 4258003 and so is a 10-foot alien.
4258170 4259380 Uh, 11, actually.
4259546 4260881 Used to be a contractor.
4261173 4262633 This thing is a hybrid?<br />What does that mean?
4262800 4264760 Meaning it's the Chinese menu<br />of DNA.
4264927 4266804 Comprised of the deadliest<br />species in the entire...
4266971 4268097 In the entire universe, yeah?
4268264 4269556 -Galaxy.<br />-What?
4269765 4271725 Galaxy. 250 billion stars.
4271850 4273435 Why go universe? Just saying.
4274019 4275437 (helicopter whirring)
4287533 4289410 Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ!
4289535 4290536 That's what you asked for?
4290619 4291620 Yeah, that'll do.
4293247 4294456 Saddle up!
4298210 4299586 COYLE: It's the best<br />we could do, man.
4302756 4303757 WILLIAMS: Go ahead. Go!
4303841 4305050 That's it? Another one.
4305217 4306218 QUINN: The other one!
4306385 4307845 Come on.<br />Let's go get my kid.
4311348 4313559 Figured something out.<br />I think we're gonna die.
4314643 4316520 We're gonna go hunt and fight<br />the what, the army?
4316687 4317938 COYLE: We're not gonna<br />fight the army...
4318022 4319648 BAXLEY: And some<br />fucking people from space!
4319732 4321191 You wanna talk survival, huh?
4321734 4322735 Fine!
4322860 4324945 You, yesterday,<br />you were on a prison bus
4325029 4326155 barking to yourself,
4326280 4327906 now you got a gun<br />in your hand.
4328115 4329325 Who's a survivor now?
4331201 4332578 We put bullets in our head
4332661 4334121 and walk<br />to the fucking hospital.
4334705 4335789 We're soldiers!
4337416 4338751 Nettles, what's our 20?
4339335 4340961 I can follow<br />your boy's chopper.
4341045 4342296 I locked into its frequency.
4356685 4357811 SOLDIER: Fence is hot!
4375079 4376538 (indistinct radio chatter)
4377915 4379124 What do you say, buddy?
4380084 4381418 You think you can get us<br />in there?
4382294 4384254 Because I'm not sure<br />that you can.
4384797 4386090 Nice reverse psychology.
4386715 4388008 I can do that, too.
4388258 4389468 Don't go fuck yourself.
4390761 4391887 (laughs)
4392888 4394348 TRAEGER: That's good. Come on.
4394848 4396975 Good. Almost up and running.<br />Five minutes.
4397059 4398060 TRAEGER: Right on.
4398143 4399520 It's a translator unit, Rory.
4399853 4400896 Been trying to figure out
4401063 4402314 what these<br />bird-chirping motherfuckers
4402398 4403649 been saying since '87.
4403816 4405484 Gave the Harvard School<br />of Linguistics
4405567 4406777 a billion-dollar grant.
4406944 4409154 Voila. Watch your step,<br />come on.
4421583 4423961 Goddamn, kid, I don't know<br />where you get it from.
4425212 4427005 (trilling)
4451488 4453365 TRAEGER: Put the translator<br />into the mainframe.
4453449 4454616 Download everything.
4461540 4462791 SAPIR: What the hell's<br />inside there?
4463083 4464626 It's property<br />of Project Stargazer.
4464710 4466753 That's what the fuck it is.<br />(laughs)
4468797 4470340 OFFICER (on comms):<br /><i>Code three. Code three.</i>
4470424 4471800 <i>We have motion</i><br /><i>at the south fence line.</i>
4472259 4473594 Send a fireteam<br />to check it out.
4473927 4476054 That's my dad.<br />He's gonna come save me now.
4476597 4477639 Oh, is he?
4478932 4480309 Is that what he's gonna do?
4481059 4482352 I'll tell you what, buddy...
4483520 4484771 if it is your daddy,
4485189 4486982 and I truly hope that it is...
4487649 4489443 he's gotta be just about
4489526 4492696 the dumbest motherfucker<br />I've ever met. (laughing)
4494907 4497993 I mean, a Ranger sniper<br />tripping wire sensors?
4498202 4499453 He's gotta be...
4501121 4502331 creating a diversion.
4502498 4503874 It's a fucking diversion.
4504333 4505334 (grunts)
4505417 4506543 Oh, shit!
4506752 4508086 Wow. Howdy.
4508337 4510088 What, are you gonna kill us<br />with a fucking tranq gun?
4510797 4512424 You took my boy, so yeah.
4513133 4514134 Told you.
4515052 4516053 Take this, son.
4516595 4519014 You outta your mind? We<br />literally have you surrounded.
4519139 4520516 That's why<br />you're coming with me.
4520599 4522100 I just want the boy.<br />Nobody's got to die.
4522184 4523060 Dad?
4525646 4526980 From here forward.
4527147 4528607 Don't look at the dead guy.
4542955 4544289 (grunting)
4549211 4550420 That was pretty good.
4550546 4551672 You all right? Did I get you?
4551755 4552756 No, I'm good.
4553674 4554758 Welcome back.
4554883 4556009 Fuck you. I never left.
4559012 4560055 You open your mouth,
4560222 4561890 I'm gonna blow your brains<br />right through it.
4562057 4563225 Come on, just get behind me.
4563725 4565310 SOLDIER (on radio):<br /><i>All units. They got Traeger.</i>
4565394 4566436 <i>They got Traeger.</i>
4567980 4569147 (softly) Let's go. Let's go.
4569815 4571483 Just tell them<br />to put the guns down.
4581243 4582286 Tell them!
4584204 4585622 If Captain McKenna<br />doesn't lower his weapon
4585706 4586665 in the next 10 seconds...
4586999 4588584 shoot the kid's knees out.<br />That work for you?
4588750 4590085 Oh, that's a really bad idea.
4590419 4592588 My guys got this place covered<br />on every angle.
4592754 4594339 That's a funny story.<br />See, I don't give a shit.
4594464 4595382 10.
4596717 4597759 Nine.
4598468 4599469 Eight.
4600846 4601847 Seven.
4602514 4604391 Come on, you just give<br />the fucking word, man.
4604474 4605475 TRAEGER: Six. Five.

4622701 4623910 (grunting)
4624036 4625120 Come on, son!
4626246 4627664 (indistinct shouting)
4627748 4628790 Take them down!
4634921 4635922 Get down, sir.
4636089 4637507 Let's go, son. Go!
4637633 4638800 SOLDIER: Come on. Come on.
4644765 4646391 Okay, take this. (spits)
4647809 4648810 You wanna vanish,
4648894 4650437 you really vanish, son,<br />you understand?
4650812 4653106 All right, we're going home.<br />I promise you.
4658403 4659655 (predator growls)
4662991 4663992 It's here.
4670707 4672209 -(predator growls)<br />-No! No! No!
4678382 4679841 SOLDIER 2: Come on,<br />go around the end there!
4680258 4681426 Stay on him!<br />Stay on him!
4681802 4682928 Move, move, move!
4683136 4684513 -You got him?<br />-SOLDIER 3: Yeah!

4714584 4716795 (low growling)
4717295 4719131 (both panting quietly)
4732060 4733437 -COYLE: Huh?<br />-All right.
4733937 4735021 Hey, McKenna.
4735272 4737941 Be reasonable. There's six<br />of you, seven of us.
4738734 4739818 (grunts)
4740068 4741069 Fuck!
4741236 4742696 Who taught you math?
4742988 4744990 You ain't the only<br />fucking sniper, white boy.
4746950 4749077 You can walk away<br />from this, Captain.
4749786 4751163 I just want the ship.
4751329 4753415 -Dad, he's lying.<br />-Yeah.
4753582 4755876 McKenna! I don't like this.
4756334 4757586 What's he doing in there?
4759629 4760922 (predator warbling)
4762257 4764509 -(loud warbling)<br />-(feedback whines)
4766219 4768305 (all groan)
4769473 4771099 It's using the translator.
4773351 4775312 PREDATOR (over speaker):<br /><i>Hello. I have enjoyed</i>
4775562 4777022 <i>watching you kill each other.</i>
4777522 4779816 <i>I came here</i><br /><i>to destroy this vessel.</i>
4780192 4781777 <i>You cannot have it.</i>
4781943 4784112 <i>What you can do is run.</i>
4784780 4787699 <i>I detect one among you</i><br /><i>who is a true warrior.</i>
4788158 4790035 <i>The one called McKenna.</i>

4800045 4801505 What the fuck<br />is time advantage?
4801588 4802672 Like a head start?
4803757 4805926 (alarm sounding)
4806301 4807761 I'm gonna wake up on a bus.
4808720 4810013 I'm gonna wake up on a bus.
4812974 4813975 Hey!
4814392 4815435 I'm coming out!
4825111 4826112 We're in.
4827030 4828406 -Baxley!<br />-Shit!
4828615 4830659 Watch where the fuck you're<br />throwing, dickhead.
4830742 4832118 -(vehicle engine stalling)<br />-Will do.
4833036 4835205 Okay, so we split up.<br />12 different directions.
4835288 4836957 -McKenna's the one he wants.<br />-TRAEGER: No, no, no!
4837165 4839417 We stay together,<br />or it'll take us one by one.
4839501 4840877 He's right. It's their MO.
4841044 4842921 -Grow a dick, will you?<br />-SOLDIER: Nothing's starting!
4843046 4845131 Son of a bitch. He must have<br />hacked the vehicles.
4845382 4847551 If we can get to the helicopter,<br />go two klicks north.
4847634 4848635 -Got you.<br />-Hey?
4848718 4850720 When this is over, you and me,<br />we're gonna dance.
4850804 4851930 I got my shoes all picked out.
4852013 4853014 All right.
4859062 4860856 (soft growling)
4861106 4862941 -Fuck.<br />-No, no, no! Don't.
4863859 4865735 Here, boy. Fetch.
4866945 4868280 -(creature barks)<br />-Here, boy. (whistles)
4868446 4869447 Here you go.
4872409 4873869 That was a valuable weapon.
4875954 4877664 Let's go.<br />He'll be coming for us.
4878623 4880333 (alarm blaring)
4904482 4905901 (warbling)
4906192 4907193 (device beeps)
4916411 4917746 Give me the goody bag.
4919414 4921833 Hey. On Halloween,<br />this blew up a whole house.
4922000 4923585 -How do you shoot it?<br />-You don't.
4923752 4925670 It just fires by itself<br />when it's being attacked.
4925837 4927297 Seriously? Oh, shit.
4929007 4930550 (man coughing)
4931801 4933595 (faint rustling)
4935764 4937015 I heard something.
4937182 4939309 TRAEGER: Hey, man.<br />That's Predator technology.
4940518 4941519 Fuck.
4941728 4943229 That-- It's gonna come back.
4943355 4945106 You got, uh, a catcher<br />on the wrist.
4945815 4946942 That's gonna come back.
4948443 4949444 No!
4950487 4952364 -(screaming)<br />-Quiet. Quiet.
4953365 4954950 -Let me see. Let me see.<br />-My fucking hand.
4955116 4956493 -Shit.<br />-My fucking hand.
4958870 4959955 Gotta be quiet.
4965210 4966252 (screaming)
4970632 4972092 (predator warbles)
4978807 4979933 Moving!
4996074 4998159 No, no, no!<br />This way. This way. This way.
4999536 5000870 There's a clearing up ahead.
5001329 5003331 Lynch left some pyro up there.<br />To cover our retreat.
5003498 5005083 Let's find it<br />and trap the motherfucker.
5005250 5007627 You guys go set it up.<br />We'll lure him in.
5008003 5009546 -Who?<br />-You and me.
5009629 5010630 Yeah? All right.
5010964 5012465 -Yeah.<br />-Let's go.
5013508 5014509 Come on.
5016428 5017929 Can I talk to you<br />for a second?
5018013 5019097 What's this "we" shit?
5019305 5020598 What, are you gonna<br />live forever, Coyle?
5020682 5022100 -Just calm down.<br />-COYLE: Calm down?
5022267 5025061 Me, calm down?<br />Yeah, okay, thanks, twitchy.
5025186 5027188 Move, move, move!<br />Up here. Up, up, up.
