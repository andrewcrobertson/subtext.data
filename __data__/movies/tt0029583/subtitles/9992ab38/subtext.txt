165007 167217 Let me see thy face.
169845 172347 What wouldst thou know,<br />my Queen?
173057 175225 Magic Mirror on the wall,
175685 178395 who is the fairest one of all?
179563 182983 Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.
183067 187195 But hold, a lovely maid I see.
188280 191574 Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.
192743 197622 Alas, she is more fair than thee.
197707 201751 Alas for her! Reveal her name.
202545 204796 Lips red as the rose.
205423 207882 Hair black as ebony.
207967 210427 Skin white as snow.
211929 213430 Snow White!
248632 250633 Want to know a secret?
250760 252510 Promise not to tell?
252845 257307 <i>We are standing by a wishing well</i>

321163 324874 <i>- Today<br />- Today</i>
325709 327544 Hello.
327670 329712 Did I frighten you?
330506 332882 Wait! Wait, please.
333592 335510 Don't run away.
336220 339222 <i>Now that I've found you</i>
339348 343601 <i>Hear what I have to say</i>
344436 347105 <i>One song</i>
347189 350775 <i>I have but one song</i>
351569 356239 <i>One song only for you</i>
358409 364372 <i>One heart tenderly beating</i>
364874 368293 <i>Ever entreating</i>
368711 372797 <i>Constant and true</i>
373465 376384 <i>One love</i>
376468 380263 <i>That has possessed me</i>
380890 383766 <i>One love</i>
383893 388438 <i>Thrilling me through</i>
388564 391941 <i>One song</i>
392067 396321 <i>My heart keeps singing</i>
396405 399949 <i>Of one love</i>
400784 405955 <i>Only for you</i>
420512 422972 Take her far into the forest.
423599 426309 Find some secluded glade
426435 428937 where she can pick wildflowers.
429313 431147 Yes, Your Majesty.
431273 435026 And there, my faithful Huntsman,
435653 437487 you will kill her!
437613 440114 But, Your Majesty,<br />the little Princess!
440199 441699 Silence!
442284 445995 You know the penalty if you fail.
447122 449624 Yes, Your Majesty.
450376 452794 But to make doubly sure
453462 455546 you do not fail,
456966 460843 bring back her heart in this.
469687 473356 <i>One song, I have but one song</i>
488372 490081 Hello there.
490332 492041 What's the matter?
492668 494836 Where's your mama and papa?
495337 497505 Why, I believe you're lost.
498173 500049 Oh, please don't cry.
505514 507515 Come on, perk up.
508183 510184 Won't you smile for me?
510686 512228 That's better.
513397 515773 Your mama and papa can't be far.
517943 519610 There they are!
521613 523364 Can you fly?
524408 527243 Good-bye. Good-bye!
535377 537378 I can't, I can't do it.
538213 542467 Forgive me.<br />I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.
542885 544344 I don't understand!
544428 547055 She's mad, jealous of you!<br />She'll stop at nothing!
547139 549474 - But, but who?<br />- The Queen.
549558 550558 - The Queen?<br />- Now, quick, child, run.
551727 553061 Run away, hide!
553145 556147 In the woods! Anywhere!<br />Never come back!
556231 560109 Now, go. Go! Go!
560652 564322 Run! Run! Hide!
687446 689530 Please don't run away.
690532 692283 I won't hurt you.
694703 697872 I'm awfully sorry.<br />I didn't mean to frighten you.
698373 701417 But you don't know<br />what I've been through.
701543 704212 And all because I was afraid.
704963 707882 I'm so ashamed of the fuss<br />I've made.
709801 712470 What do you do<br />when things go wrong?
714473 716891 You sing a song!
745837 749882 <i>With a smile and a song</i>
749967 753386 <i>Life is just like a bright,<br />sunny day</i>
753470 756806 <i>Your cares fade away</i>
757140 760601 <i>And your heart is young</i>
762980 766816 <i>With a smile and a song</i>
766942 770403 <i>All the world seems to waken anew</i>
770487 773656 <i>Rejoicing with you</i>
773782 776993 <i>As the song is sung</i>
779329 781872 <i>There's no use in grumbling</i>
781957 785334 <i>When raindrops come tumbling</i>
785836 789964 <i>Remember you're the one</i>
790507 795970 <i>Who can fill the world with sunshine</i>
796555 799682 <i>When you smile and you sing</i>
801143 804520 <i>Everything is in tune and it's spring</i>
804646 808024 <i>And life flows along</i>
808317 813195 <i>With a smile and a song</i>
818327 820786 I really feel quite happy now.
820871 823247 I'm sure I'll get along somehow.
823665 826167 Everything's going to be all right.
827336 830504 But I do need a place<br />to sleep at night.
831757 834342 I can't sleep in the ground<br />like you
835052 837345 or in a tree the way you do.
838180 842016 And I'm sure no nest would possibly<br />be big enough for me.
843268 845686 Maybe you know where I can stay.
846188 848189 In the woods somewhere?
849107 850441 You do?
851610 853611 Will you take me there?
898907 900616 Oh, it's adorable!
902077 904161 Just like a doll's house.
918427 920010 I like it here.
931648 934775 Ooh, it's dark inside.
945370 947455 Guess there's no one home.
951042 952501 Hello?
953128 954628 May I come in?
983200 985242 What a cute little chair!
987829 990331 Why, there's seven little chairs!
990665 992917 Must be seven little children.
993502 997546 And from the look of this table,<br />seven untidy little children.
1000592 1003552 A pickaxe. A stocking too!
1008225 1009892 And a shoe!
1015065 1017650 And just look at that fireplace.
1017734 1019610 It's covered with dust.
1026910 1029411 And look, cobwebs everywhere!
1030038 1032373 My, my, my!
1032457 1034708 What a pile of dirty dishes!
1037254 1039421 And just look at that broom!
1042384 1045052 Why, they've never swept this room.
1045929 1048389 You'd think their mother would...
1048932 1051058 Maybe they have no mother.
1052227 1053978 Then they're orphans.
1054729 1056438 That's too bad.
1057941 1059275 I know!
1059401 1061902 We'll clean the house<br />and surprise them.
1061987 1064405 Then maybe they'll let me stay.
1070912 1073080 Now, you wash the dishes.
1073456 1075416 You tidy up the room.
1076084 1078377 You clean the fireplace.
1078461 1080462 And I will use the broom.
1087345 1089847 <i>Just whistle while you work</i>
1092267 1096979 <i>And cheerfully together<br />we can tidy up the place</i>
1097105 1099315 <i>So hum a merry tune</i>
1101526 1106322 <i>It won't take long when there's a song<br />to help you set the pace</i>
1106448 1108657 <i>And as you sweep the room</i>
1108783 1110868 <i>Imagine that the broom</i>
1110952 1116165 <i>Is someone that you love and soon<br />you'll find you're dancing to the tune</i>
1116291 1120127 Oh, no, no, no, no!<br />Put them in the tub.
1120211 1122671 <i>When hearts are high the time will fly</i>
1122797 1125007 <i>So whistle while you work</i>
1134517 1136352 Not under the rug.
1266024 1268609 <i>So whistle while you work</i>
1293301 1295594 <i>We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig</i>

1304896 1307106 <i>If ya dig, dig, dig<br />with a shovel or a pick</i>
1307190 1309525 <i>- In a mine<br />- In a mine</i>

1311986 1316657 <i>- Where a million diamonds<br />- Shine</i>
1316741 1318826 <i>We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig</i>

1326000 1328377 <i>We dig up diamonds by the score</i>
1328503 1330629 <i>A thousand rubies,<br />sometimes more</i>
1330713 1332923 <i>Though we don't know<br />what we dig 'em for</i>

1480321 1482531 Oh, what adorable little beds!
1484575 1487828 And look,<br />they have their names carved on them.
1488371 1490872 Doc, Happy,
1490999 1492666 Sneezy, Dopey...
1493209 1495502 What funny names for children!
1495878 1499298 Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.

1601109 1602776 Jiminy Crickets!
1603611 1605362 - The door is open.<br />- The chimney's smoking.
1605446 1606947 - Something's in there.<br />- Maybe a ghost.
1607073 1608615 - Or a goblin.<br />- A demon.
1608741 1610117 Or a dragon.
1610660 1613662 Mark my words,<br />there's trouble a-brewin'.
1614330 1617165 Felt it coming all day.<br />My corns hurt.
1618126 1619960 - Gosh!<br />- That's a bad sign.
1620086 1622087 - What'll we do?<br />- Let's sneak up on it.

1721521 1724272 Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.
1724398 1727567 Why, why, why, why,<br />the whole place is clean!
1728236 1730445 There's dirty work afoot.
1731697 1733573 Sink's empty.
1733699 1736576 Hey, someone stole our dishes!
1737203 1740288 They ain't stole.<br />They're hid in the cupboard.
1742458 1744376 My cup's been washed.
1745086 1746711 Sugar's gone.
1749048 1750924 Something's cooking.
1751926 1753593 Smells good!
1753719 1756888 Don't touch it, you fools!<br />Might be poison.
1760643 1763144 See? It's witches' brew.
1764647 1767607 Look what's happened<br />to our stable... Table.
1768651 1770110 Flowers!

2098731 2100440 Well...
2101275 2104944 - What is it?<br />- Why, it... It's a girl!
2106488 2108781 She's mighty purdy.
2108908 2113453 She's beautiful, just like a angel.
2114413 2116956 Angel, hah! She's a female!
2117082 2120960 And all females is poison!<br />They're full of wicked wiles.
2122254 2124130 What are wicked wiles?
2124256 2126633 I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.
2128135 2130136 Not so loud. You'll wake her up.
2130262 2133306 Let her wake up!<br />She don't belong here nohow.
2133599 2134849 - Look out.<br />- She's movin'.
2134975 2137018 - She's wakin' up.<br />- What'll we do?
2137144 2138478 Hide.
2142316 2144484 Oh, dear.
2146153 2148655 I wonder if the children are...
2159375 2162001 Why, why, you're little men!
2167508 2169342 How do you do?
2173639 2177517 - I said, how do you do?<br />- How do you do what?
2177851 2180895 Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad!
2181689 2184649 Now, don't tell me who you are.<br />Let me guess.
2185651 2187652 I know, you're Doc.

2219268 2222729 - Yes, and you must be...<br />- Happy, ma'am. That's me.
2222855 2225690 And this is Dopey. He don't talk none.
2225774 2229402 - You mean he can't talk?<br />- He don't know. He never tried.
2229528 2231904 Oh, that's too bad.
2237619 2239704 You must be Grumpy.
2240581 2242457 Oh, yes! Yes!
2243250 2245918 Hah! We know who we are.
2246045 2249255 Ask her who she is<br />and what she's a-doin' here.
2249381 2252133 Yeah!<br />What are you and who are you doin'?
2252259 2255344 What are you... Who are you, my dear?

2280329 2284123 - Who's... Gutter...<br />- Shut up and tell her to get out!
2284792 2286709 Please don't send me away!
2286794 2288878 - If you do, she'll kill me.<br />- Kill you?
2288962 2290129 - Who will?<br />- Yes, who?
2290255 2292215 - My stepmother, the Queen.<br />- The Queen?

2293967 2297011 - She's mighty mean!<br />- She's an old witch!
2297137 2298679 I'm warnin' ya.
2299139 2300598 If the Queen finds her here,
2300682 2304143 she'll swoop down<br />and wreak her vengeance on us!
2304686 2306813 But she doesn't know where I am!
2306939 2309816 She don't, eh? She knows everything.
2310442 2312485 She's full of black magic.
2312986 2315655 She can even make herself invisible.
2317783 2320493 Might be in this room right now.
2325124 2327333 Oh, she'll never find me here.
2327793 2330962 And if you let me stay,<br />I'll keep house for you.
2331046 2333673 I'll wash and sew<br />and sweep and cook and...

2389730 2391397 Just a minute.
2392774 2396444 Supper's not quite ready.<br />You'll just have time to wash.
2397404 2399363 Wash? Wash?
2399448 2403034 - Wash? Wash? Wash?<br />- Hah! Knew there was a catch to it.
2405537 2408706 - Why wash?<br />- What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.
2408790 2410791 'Tain't New Year's.
2411585 2414003 Oh, perhaps you have washed.
2414087 2415713 Perhaps we...

2473772 2475606 Worse than I thought!
2479653 2481279 How shocking!
2483824 2486367 Goodness me, this will never do.
2488328 2492498 March straight outside and wash,<br />or you'll not get a bite to eat.
2528076 2530995 Well, aren't you going to wash?
2532998 2535875 What's the matter?<br />Cat got your tongue?
2546720 2548721 Did you hurt yourself?
2560776 2562735 Hah, women!

2641815 2644358 <i>You may be cold<br />and wet when you're done</i>
2644484 2647319 <i>But you gotta admit<br />it's good and clean fun</i>
2647446 2650281 <i>So splash all you like,<br />'tain't any trick</i>
2650365 2653784 <i>As soon as you're through<br />you'll feel mighty slick</i>

2678059 2682521 and smellin' ya up with<br />that stuff called perfoom.
2708882 2712343 A fine bunch of water lilies<br />you turned out to be.
2713762 2717431 I'd like to see anybody<br />make me wash if I didn't wanna.
2749422 2750881 Get him!

2821786 2824330 <i>Now, scrub good and hard,<br />it can't be denied</i>

2849314 2851190 Smells like a petunia.
2851983 2853651 He sure is cute!
2854736 2857029 You'll pay dearly for this!
2857364 2858864 Supper!
2860200 2862993 - Supper!<br />- Food. Hooray!
2884849 2887476 Magic Mirror on the wall,
2887560 2890896 who now is the fairest one of all?
2891940 2894858 Over the seven jeweled hills
2894943 2897486 beyond the seventh fall,
2897570 2900072 in the cottage of the seven dwarfs
2900532 2904868 dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.
2905787 2909998 Snow White lies dead in the forest.
2910083 2912751 The Huntsman has brought me proof.
2913753 2916255 Behold her heart.
2917257 2919758 Snow White still lives,
2919884 2921969 the fairest in the land.
2922762 2926807 'Tis the heart of a pig<br />you hold in your hand.
2927642 2929435 The heart of a pig!
2930103 2932104 Then I've been tricked!
2955462 2957504 The heart of a pig!
2958339 2960132 The blundering fool!
2960842 2963927 I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage
2964012 2966930 in a disguise so complete
2967015 2970476 no one will ever suspect.
2972479 2977691 Now, a formula to transform<br />my beauty into ugliness,
2978359 2982154 change my queenly raiment<br />to a peddler's cloak.
2984199 2986992 Mummy dust to make me old.
2988328 2991455 To shroud my clothes,<br />the black of night.
2995460 3000214 To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.
3007722 3011683 To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.
3015688 3017856 A blast of wind
3018650 3021401 to fan my hate!
3022904 3025155 A thunderbolt
3027033 3029201 to mix it well.
3030912 3032246 Now,
3033248 3036375 begin thy magic spell.
3059732 3061066 Look!
3062026 3063402 My hands!
3069409 3070742 My voice!
3072579 3073954 My voice.
3078126 3081086 A perfect disguise.
3085425 3087092 And now...
3088595 3091096 A special sort of death
3091723 3093765 for one so fair.
3094767 3096435 What shall it be?
3099439 3101648 A poisoned apple!
3101983 3104484 Sleeping Death.
3165838 3167798 <i>I'd like to dance and tap my feet</i>
3167882 3169800 <i>But they won't keep in rhythm</i>
3169884 3173929 <i>You see, I washed 'em both today<br />and I can't do nothin' with 'em</i>
3174013 3177933 <i>Ho-hum, the tune is dumb,<br />the words don't mean a thing</i>
3178017 3181687 <i>Isn't this a silly song<br />for anyone to sing?</i>
3194075 3195367 I...
3201499 3203583 Oh, gosh!
3208506 3212342 <i>I chased a polecat up a tree,<br />way out upon a limb</i>
3212427 3216555 <i>And when he got the best of me,<br />I got the worst of him</i>
3216681 3220559 <i>Ho-hum, the tune is dumb,<br />the words don't mean a thing</i>
3220685 3224438 <i>Isn't this a silly song<br />for anyone to sing?</i>
3294884 3297552 Watch out. Be ca... Watch... Watch...
3297678 3299638 Watch... Watch...
3302725 3304059 Thanks.
3348688 3352607 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
3352692 3354568 Hey! Hey!
3362743 3364202 Hooray!
3403242 3404993 That was fun!
3405077 3406828 Now you do something.
3406913 3408538 Well, what shall I do?
3409081 3412167 - Tell us a story.<br />- Yes, tell us a story.
3412251 3415253 - A true story.<br />- A love story.
3415755 3419341 Well, once there was a princess.
3419759 3422010 Was the princess you?
3422094 3425180 - And she fell in love.<br />- Was it hard to do?
3425264 3427474 Oh, it was very easy.
3427600 3430810 Anyone could see that the Prince<br />was charming.
3431437 3433021 The only one for me.
3433105 3435690 Was he strong and handsome?
3435775 3437525 Was he big and tall?
3437610 3441363 There's nobody like him<br />anywhere at all.
3441447 3443490 Did he say he loved ya?
3443616 3445617 Did he steal a kiss?
3445701 3448870 <i>He was so romantic</i>
3449705 3453875 <i>I could not resist</i>
3463386 3469140 <i>Some day my prince will come</i>
3470059 3474980 <i>Some day we'll meet again</i>
3475690 3481653 <i>And away to his castle we'll go</i>
3482530 3486032 <i>To be happy forever</i>
3486158 3488243 <i>I know</i>
3492206 3497585 <i>Some day when spring is here</i>
3498504 3503758 <i>We'll find our love anew</i>
3504593 3509431 <i>And the birds will sing</i>
3510516 3515270 <i>And wedding bells will ring</i>
3516772 3522193 <i>Some day when my dreams</i>
3522862 3526239 <i>Come true</i>
3538878 3540837 Oh, my goodness!
3540921 3542839 It's past bedtime.
3542923 3544924 Go right upstairs to bed.
3547261 3549554 Wait! Hold on there, men!
3551307 3555643 The Princess will sleep<br />in our beds upstairs.
3555728 3557270 But where will you sleep?
3557396 3562150 Oh, we'll be quite comfortable<br />down here in... in...
3562234 3563401 In a pig's eye!
3563486 3566654 In a pig's eye... Sty.<br />No, no! I mean...
3566739 3569449 We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?
3569992 3572619 Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.
3572745 3575622 Now don't you worry about us.
3575748 3580752 - We'll be all right, ma'am.<br />- Go right on up now, my dear.
3580836 3583088 Well, if you insist.
3585091 3586633 Good night.
3586759 3588593 Good night, Princess.
3591806 3593556 You're sure you'll be comfortable?
3593641 3596935 Oh, yes. Very comfortable.
3598020 3600021 Well, pleasant dreams.
3600940 3603024 Pleasant dreams.
3608197 3609239 Let go!
3609323 3611157 - I saw it first!<br />- Now, men, don't get excited.
3611283 3613576 Remember, share.<br />It's share and share alike.
3613661 3615995 Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!
3630302 3633847 Bless the seven little men<br />who have been so kind to me.
3634723 3638393 And... And may my dreams come true.
3638978 3640145 Amen.
3641647 3644566 Oh, yes!<br />And please make Grumpy like me.
3645734 3647402 Women!
3653325 3655743 A fine kettle of fish!
3759932 3762517 Dip the apple in the brew.
3763352 3766980 Let the Sleeping Death seep through!
3777783 3780702 Look! On the skin!
3781287 3784872 The symbol of what lies within.
3785624 3790211 Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.
3790629 3793047 To make her hunger for a bite.
3796343 3797969 Have a bite?
3801140 3803182 It's not for you.
3803642 3805560 It's for Snow White.
3806687 3809314 When she breaks the tender peel
3809815 3812150 to taste the apple in my hand,
3812526 3815987 her breath will still,<br />her blood congeal.
3816572 3819907 Then I'll be fairest in the land!
3822703 3824162 But wait!
3825748 3828082 There may be an antidote.
3828167 3830335 Nothing must be overlooked.
3832755 3835089 Oh, here it is!
3845517 3847935 Love's First Kiss.
3849938 3851773 No fear of that.
3852274 3854734 The dwarfs will think she's dead.
3855361 3858363 She'll be buried alive!
3869792 3872418 Buried alive!

4110824 4113951 The little men will be away
4114077 4116579 and she'll be all alone
4117122 4120625 with a harmless old peddler woman.
4122920 4126130 A harmless old peddler woman!
4136266 4141020 <i>Some day my prince will come</i>
4141813 4146776 <i>Some day we'll meet again</i>
4146860 4151697 <i>And away to his castle we'll go</i>

4194741 4197076 All alone, my pet?
4198370 4200705 Why, why, yes, I am. But...
4200831 4204417 The, the little men are not here?
4205419 4207545 No, they're not, but...
4211008 4212717 Making pies?
4213927 4215678 Yes, gooseberry pies.
4215762 4218014 It's apple pies
4218098 4221392 that make the menfolks' mouths water.
4222394 4226772 Pies made from apples like these.
4229276 4231861 - Oh, they do look delicious.<br />- Yes!
4231945 4235406 But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.
4239953 4241787 Like to try one?
4244124 4247293 Go on. Go on, have a bite.
4254926 4257636 Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away!
4257763 4260598 Shame on you,<br />frightening a poor old lady.
4262225 4264310 Oh, I thought I'd lost it.
4266396 4269106 There, there. I'm sorry.
4269608 4272109 Oh! My heart!
4272819 4275154 Oh, my... My poor heart.
4276073 4279116 Take me into the house and let me rest.
4279785 4282328 A drink of water, please.
4313151 4314318 <i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>
4314444 4318656 <i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho,<br />it's off to work we go</i>
4321368 4322993 <i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>
4337717 4339385 Hey, look!
4344391 4347643 - Stop that!<br />- Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!
4347727 4349562 Go on! Get outta here!
4354526 4356735 What ails these crazy birds?
4357529 4358988 They've gone plumb daffy.
4359072 4360906 Yeah, they've...
4366496 4370833 And because you've been<br />so good to poor old Granny,
4371418 4374044 I'll share a secret with you.
4374588 4376714 This is no ordinary apple.
4377215 4379425 It's a magic wishing apple.
4380552 4382261 A wishing apple?
4382387 4383721 Yes!
4384222 4388767 One bite and all your dreams<br />will come true.
4389227 4391854 - Really?<br />- Yes, girlie.
4393106 4395024 Now, make a wish
4395734 4397443 and take a bite.
4397903 4400196 - Go on, get!<br />- These pesky critters won't stop.
4400280 4401947 - 'Tain't natural.<br />- There's something wrong.
4402073 4404909 They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.
4405410 4408787 Maybe the old Queen's<br />got Snow White.
4408914 4410581 - The Queen!<br />- Snow White!
4410707 4413083 The Queen'll kill her!<br />We gotta save her!
4413210 4415628 Yes! Yes!<br />We, we, we gotta save her!
4415754 4417171 - She'll kill her!<br />- What'll we do?
4417255 4419465 Yes, yes, what'll we do?
4419591 4422801 Come on! Giddap!
4432229 4434730 Wait for me! Wait for...
4448954 4453165 There must be something<br />your little heart desires.
4454125 4456627 Perhaps there's someone you love.
4457254 4459213 Well, there is someone.
4459297 4461674 I thought so. I thought so!
4463176 4466553 Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.
4466638 4469515 Now, take the apple, dearie,
4469641 4471183 and make a wish.
4473645 4476105 I wish... I wish...
4476189 4478482 That's it, go on! Go on.
4492205 4495207 And that he will carry me away<br />to his castle
4496501 4499586 where we will live happily ever after.
4499671 4502631 Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.
4507053 4509305 Don't let the wish grow cold!
4511057 4514059 Oh, I feel strange.
4515020 4519148 Her breath will still.
4520317 4523527 Her blood congeal.
4534205 4537875 Now I'll be fairest in the land!
4546259 4548052 Hurry, hurry.
4553892 4555517 There she goes!
4575455 4576914 After her!
4606277 4609113 I'm trapped! What will I do?
4609948 4612366 The meddling little fools!
4617288 4621208 I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.
