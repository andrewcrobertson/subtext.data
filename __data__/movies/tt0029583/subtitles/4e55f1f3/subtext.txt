151902 154737 Slave in the Magic Mirror,
155280 158282 come from the farthest space.
159076 161744 Through wind and darkness, I summon thee.
162955 164163 Speak!
165707 167917 Let me see thy face.
170546 173047 What wouldst thou know, my Queen?
173757 175925 Magic Mirror on the wall,
176385 179095 who is the fairest one of all?
180264 183683 Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.
183767 187895 But hold, a lovely maid I see.
188981 192275 Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.
193443 198322 Alas, she is more fair than thee.
198407 202451 Alas for her! Reveal her name.
203245 205496 Lips red as the rose.
206123 208583 Hair black as ebony.
208667 211127 Skin white as snow.
212629 214130 Snow White!
249333 250416 Want to know a secret?
251627 253210 Promise not to tell?
253545 258007 <i>We are standing by a wishing well</i>
259468 262136 <i>Make a wish into the well</i>
262220 264847 <i>That's all you have to do</i>
264973 268017 <i>And if you hear it echoing</i>
268143 271520 <i>Your wish will soon come true</i>
272564 276359 <i>I'm wishing</i>
276485 279195 <i>For the one I love</i>
279321 282657 <i>To find me</i>
282741 285368 <i>Today</i>
285827 289038 <i>I'm hoping</i>
289498 292208 <i>And I'm dreaming of</i>
292334 295586 <i>The nice things</i>
295671 298547 <i>He'll say</i>
311895 315356 <i>I'm wishing</i>
315440 318234 <i>For the one I love</i>
318360 321737 <i>To find me</i>
321863 325574 - <i>Today</i><br />- <i>Today</i>
326410 328244 - Oh!<br />- Hello.
328370 330413 - Oh.<br />- Did I frighten you?
331206 333582 Wait! Wait, please.
334292 336210 Don't run away.
336920 339922 <i>Now that I've found you</i>
340048 344301 <i>Hear what I have to say</i>
345137 347805 <i>One song</i>
347889 351475 <i>I have but one song</i>
352269 356939 <i>One song only for you</i>
359109 365072 <i>One heart tenderly beating</i>
365574 368993 <i>Ever entreating</i>
369411 373497 <i>Constant and true</i>
374166 377084 <i>One love</i>
377169 380963 <i>That has possessed me</i>
381590 384467 <i>One love</i>
384593 389138 <i>Thrilling me through</i>
389264 392641 <i>One song</i>
392768 397021 <i>My heart keeps singing</i>
397105 400649 <i>Of one love</i>
401485 406655 <i>Only for you</i>
421213 423672 Take her far into the forest.
424299 427009 Find some secluded glade
427135 429637 where she can pick wildflowers.
430013 431847 Yes, Your Majesty.
431973 435726 And there, my faithful huntsman,
436353 438187 you will kill her!
438313 440815 But, Your Majesty, the little princess!
440899 442399 Silence!
442984 446695 You know the penalty if you fail.
447823 450324 Yes, Your Majesty.
451076 453494 But to make doubly sure
454162 456247 you do not fail,
457666 461544 bring back her heart in this.
470387 474056 <i>One song<br />I have but one song</i>
489072 490781 Hello there.
491032 492741 What's the matter?
493368 495536 Where's your mama and papa?
496037 498205 Why, I believe you're lost.
499457 500749 Oh, please don't cry.
506256 508215 Come on, perk up.
508884 510718 Won't you smile for me?
510802 512928 That's better.
514097 516473 Your mama and papa can't be far.
518643 520311 There they are!
522314 524064 Can you fly?
525108 527943 Goodbye. Goodbye!
536077 538078 I can't. I can't do it.
538914 543167 Forgive me.<br />I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.
543585 545044 I don't understand!
545128 547755 She's mad, jealous of you!<br />She'll stop at nothing!
547839 550132 - But who?<br />- The queen.
550258 551258 - The queen?<br />- Now, quick, child, run.
552427 553761 Run away, hide!
553845 556847 In the woods! Anywhere! Never come back!
556932 560809 Now, go. Go! Go!
561353 565022 Run! Run! Hide!
682724 684058 Oh!
688146 690230 Please don't run away.
691232 692983 I won't hurt you.
695403 698572 I'm awfully sorry.<br />I didn't mean to frighten you.
699074 702117 But you don't know what I've been through.
702243 704912 And all because I was afraid.
705663 708582 I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.
710502 713003 What do you do when things go wrong?
715173 717591 Oh! You sing a song!
746538 750582 <i>With a smile and a song</i>
750667 754086 <i>Life is just like a bright, sunny day</i>
754170 757506 <i>Your cares fade away</i>
757841 760175 <i>And your heart is young</i>
763680 767516 <i>With a smile and a song</i>
767642 771103 <i>All the world seems to waken anew</i>
771187 774356 <i>Rejoicing with you</i>
774482 777693 <i>As the song is sung</i>
780029 781363 <i>There's no use in grumbling</i>
782657 786034 <i>When raindrops come tumbling</i>
786536 790664 <i>Remember you're the one</i>
791207 796670 <i>Who can fill the world with sunshine</i>
797255 800382 <i>When you smile and you sing</i>
801843 805220 <i>Everything is in tune and it's spring</i>
805346 807639 <i>And life flows along</i>
809017 813896 <i>With a smile and a song</i>
819027 821487 I really feel quite happy now.
821571 823947 I'm sure I'll get along somehow.
824365 826867 Everything's going to be all right.
828036 831205 But I do need a place to sleep at night.
831706 835042 I can't sleep in the ground like you
835752 838045 or in a tree the way you do.
838880 842716 And I'm sure no nest would<br />possibly be big enough for me.
843968 846386 Maybe you know where I can stay.
846888 848013 In the woods somewhere?
849724 850807 You do?
852393 854311 Will you take me there?
899607 901316 Oh, it's adorable!
902777 904861 Just like a doll's house.
919127 920711 I like it here.
932348 935475 It's dark inside.
946070 948155 Guess there's no one home.
951743 953201 Hello?
953828 955329 May I come in?
979270 980437 Oh!
983900 985942 What a cute little chair!
988529 991031 Why, there's seven little chairs!
991366 993617 Must be seven little children.
994202 998246 And from the look of this table,<br />seven untidy little children.
1001292 1004252 A pickaxe. A stocking, too!
1008925 1010300 And a shoe!
1015765 1018350 And just look at that fireplace.
1018434 1020310 It's covered with dust.
1027610 1030112 And look, cobwebs everywhere!
1030738 1033073 My, my, my!
1033157 1035409 What a pile of dirty dishes!
1037120 1040122 And just look at that broom!
1043084 1045752 Why, they've never swept this room.
1046629 1048213 You'd think their mother would...
1049632 1051758 Maybe they have no mother.
1052927 1054678 Then they're orphans.
1055430 1057139 That's too bad.
1058641 1059975 I know!
1060101 1062602 We'll clean the house and surprise them.
1062687 1064646 Then maybe they'll let me stay.
1071612 1073780 Now, you wash the dishes.
1074157 1076116 You tidy up the room.
1076784 1079077 You clean the fireplace.
1079162 1081163 And I will use the broom.
1088045 1090547 <i>Just whistle while you work</i>
1092967 1097679 <i>And cheerfully together<br />We can tidy up the place</i>
1097805 1099890 <i>So, hum a merry tune</i>
1102226 1107022 <i>It won't take long when there's a song<br />To help you set the pace</i>
1107148 1109357 <i>And as you sweep the room</i>
1109484 1111568 <i>Imagine that the broom</i>
1111652 1116865 <i>Is someone that you love and soon<br />You'll find you're dancing to the tune</i>
1116991 1120827 Oh! No, no, no. Put them in the tub.
1120912 1123371 <i>When hearts are high<br />The time will fly</i>
1123498 1125707 <i>So, whistle while you work</i>
1135259 1137052 Not under the rug.
1266724 1268934 <i>So, whistle while you work</i>
1294001 1296294 <i>We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig</i>
1296379 1298546 <i>In our mine the whole day through</i>
1298673 1303259 <i>To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig<br />Is what we like to do</i>
1303344 1305512 <i>It ain't no trick to get rich quick</i>
1305596 1307806 <i>If ya dig, dig, dig<br />With a shovel or a pick</i>
1307890 1312560 <i>In a mine</i>
1312687 1317232 - <i>Where a million diamonds</i><br />- <i>Shine</i>
1317358 1318358 <i>We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig</i>
1319610 1320735 <i>From early morn 'til night</i>
1321946 1326449 <i>We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig<br />Up everything in sight</i>
1327702 1329077 <i>We dig up diamonds by the score</i>
1329203 1331287 <i>A thousand rubies<br />Sometimes more</i>
1332540 1333623 <i>Though we don't know what we dig 'em for</i>

1481021 1483231 Oh, what adorable little beds!
1485276 1488528 And look, they have their names<br />carved on them.
1489071 1491573 Doc, Happy,
1491699 1493074 Sneezy, Dopey.
1493200 1496202 What funny names for children!
1496579 1499998 Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.
1501375 1504002 I'm a little sleepy myself.

1592800 1595969 Our house! The lit's light.<br />The light's lit.
1601809 1603476 Jiminy Crickets!
1604311 1606062 - The door is open.<br />- The chimney's smoking.
1606146 1607647 - Something's in there.<br />- Maybe a ghost.
1607773 1609315 - Or a goblin.<br />- A demon.
1609441 1610817 Or a dragon.
1611360 1614362 Mark my words, there's trouble a-brewin'.
1615030 1617865 Felt it coming all day. My corns hurt.
1618826 1620660 - Gosh!<br />- That's a bad sign.
1620786 1622787 - What'll we do?<br />- Let's sneak up on it.
1622871 1625623 Yes. We'll squeak up. Sneak up.
1625708 1628167 Come on, hen. Men. Follow me.
1676383 1679427 Careful, men. Search every cook and nanny.
1679553 1681888 Hook and granny. Crooked fan.
1682014 1683723 Search everywhere.
1704578 1705787 Quiet.

1717424 1719258 Chair's been dusted!
1719593 1722095 Our window's been washed.
1722221 1724972 Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.
1725099 1728267 Why, why, why, why,<br />the whole place is clean!
1728936 1731145 There's dirty work afoot.
1732398 1734273 Sink's empty.
1734400 1737276 Hey, someone stole our dishes!
1737903 1740988 They ain't stole.<br />They're hid in the cupboard.
1743158 1745076 My cup's been washed.
1745786 1747412 Sugar's gone.
1749748 1751124 Something's cooking.
1752626 1754293 Smells good!
1754420 1757463 Don't touch it, you fools!<br />Might be poison.
1761343 1763845 See? It's witches' brew.
1765347 1768307 Look what's happened to our stable. Table.
1768976 1770017 Flowers!
1771270 1773771 Look, goldenrod.
1773856 1777483 Don't do it. Take them away.<br />My nose! My hay fever!
1777776 1781654 You know I can't stand it.<br />I can't... I can't... I...

1811143 1814562 When you gotta, you gotta. I gotta.
1815856 1817148 It's coming.
1820194 1821444 - Don't let him.<br />- Stop him.
1824031 1825615 - No, tie it tight.<br />- Don't let go.
1825699 1827074 - Hold him tight.<br />- I'll tie it.
1827201 1828618 Make a hard knot.
1828702 1830786 There, that will hold him.
1832206 1833873 Thanks!
1833999 1837210 Quiet, you fool!<br />You want to get us all killed?
1843050 1845718 - What's that?<br />- That's it.
1845844 1849555 - Sounded close.<br />- It's in this room right now.
1872037 1875414 - It's up there.<br />- Yeah. In the bedroom.
1877376 1880753 One of us has gotta go down<br />and chase it up.
1880921 1882964 Up. Down.
1901149 1902942 Here, take it.
1904278 1905945 Don't be nervous.

2000749 2002750 Don't let it get away!
2006046 2008839 Hold on there. It's only Dopey.
2008924 2010758 - Did you see it?<br />- How big is it?
2010884 2013386 - Was it a dragon?<br />- Has it got horns?
2013512 2015680 - Was it breathing fire?<br />- Was it droolin'?
2015764 2017390 What was it doin'?
2021728 2025106 He says it's a monster asleep in our beds!
2025899 2027149 - Let's attack.<br />- While it's sleeping.
2027234 2028275 Yeah, while it's sleeping.
2028402 2030736 - Hurry, men. It's now or never!<br />- Off with its head.
2030862 2032363 - Break its bones.<br />- Chop it to pieces.
2032447 2034198 We'll kill it dead.
2061268 2063018 - Jiminy Crickets!<br />- Gosh!
2063103 2064937 - Gee!<br />- What a monster!
2065063 2066564 It covers three beds.
2067274 2069275 Let's kill it before it wakes up.
2069401 2070985 Which end do we kill?
2099431 2101140 Well...
2101975 2105644 - What is it?<br />- Why, it's a girl!
2107189 2109482 She's mighty purdy.
2109608 2114153 She's beautiful, just like a angel.

2117783 2121660 And all females is poison!<br />They're full of wicked wiles.
2122954 2124830 What are wicked wiles?
2124956 2127124 I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.
2128835 2130586 Not so loud. You'll wake her up.

2305387 2307513 But she doesn't know where I am.
2307639 2310516 She don't, eh? She knows everything.
2311142 2313185 She's full of black magic.
2313687 2316355 She can even make herself invisible.
2318483 2321193 Might be in this room right now.
2325824 2328033 Oh, she'll never find me here.

2885550 2888176 Magic Mirror on the wall,
2888261 2891596 who now is the fairest one of all?
2892640 2895559 Over the seven jeweled hills
2895643 2898186 beyond the seventh fall,
2898271 2900772 in the cottage of the seven dwarfs
2901232 2905569 dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.
2906487 2910699 Snow White lies dead in the forest.
2910783 2913451 The huntsman has brought me proof.
2914453 2916955 Behold her heart.
2917957 2920458 Snow White still lives,
2920585 2922669 the fairest in the land.
2923462 2927507 'Tis the heart of a pig<br />you hold in your hand.
2928342 2930135 The heart of a pig!
2930803 2932804 Then I've been tricked!
2956162 2958204 The heart of a pig!
2959040 2960832 The blundering fool!
2961542 2964628 I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage
2964712 2967631 in a disguise so complete
2967715 2971176 no one will ever suspect.
2973179 2978391 Now, a formula to transform<br />my beauty into ugliness,
2979060 2982854 change my queenly raiment<br />to a peddler's cloak.
2984857 2987692 Mummy Dust to make me old.
2989028 2992155 To shroud my clothes, the black of night.
2996160 3000664 To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.
3008422 3012384 To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.
3016389 3018556 A blast of wind
3019350 3022102 to fan my hate!
3023604 3025814 A thunderbolt
3027733 3029901 to mix it well.
3031612 3032946 Now,
3033948 3037075 begin thy magic spell.
3060433 3061766 Look!
3062727 3064102 My hands!
3070109 3071443 My voice!
3073279 3074362 My voice.
3078826 3081745 A perfect disguise.
3086125 3087792 And now,
3089295 3091796 a special sort of death
3092423 3094466 for one so fair.
3095468 3097135 What shall it be?
3097678 3098845 Ah!
3100139 3102348 A poisoned apple!
3102683 3105185 Sleeping Death.
3166539 3168498 <i>I'd like to dance and tap my feet</i>
3168582 3170500 <i>But they won't keep in rhythm</i>
3170584 3174629 <i>You see, I washed 'em both today<br />And I can't do nothin' with 'em</i>
3174713 3178633 <i>Ho-hum, the tune is dumb<br />The words don't mean a thing</i>
3178717 3182387 <i>Isn't this a silly song<br />For anyone to sing?</i>
3194567 3195608 <i>I...</i>
3202199 3204284 Oh, gosh!
3209206 3213042 <i>I chased a polecat up a tree<br />Way out upon a limb</i>
3213127 3216045 <i>And when he got the best of me<br />I got the worst of him</i>
3217381 3221259 <i>Ho-hum, the tune is dumb<br />The words don't mean a thing</i>
3221385 3224262 <i>Isn't this a silly song<br />For anyone to sing?</i>
3295584 3298252 Watch out. Be care... Watch... Watch...
3298379 3300338 Watch... Watch...
3303425 3304759 Thanks.
3349388 3353307 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
3353392 3355268 Hey! Hey!
3363444 3364902 Hooray!
3403942 3405693 That was fun!
3405778 3407528 Now you do something.
3407613 3409238 Well, what shall I do?
3409782 3412867 - Tell us a story.<br />- Yes, tell us a story.
3412951 3415953 - A true story.<br />- A love story.
3416455 3420041 Well, once there was a princess.
3420459 3422710 Was the princess you?
3422795 3425880 - And she fell in love.<br />- Was it hard to do?
3425964 3428174 Oh, it was very easy.
3428300 3431511 Anyone could see<br />that the prince was charming.
3432137 3433721 The only one for me.
3433806 3436390 Was he strong and handsome?
3436475 3438226 Was he big and tall?
3438310 3442063 There's nobody like him anywhere at all.
3442147 3444190 Did he say he loved ya?
3444316 3446317 Did he steal a kiss?
3446401 3449570 <i>He was so romantic</i>
3450405 3454575 <i>I could not resist</i>
3464086 3469841 <i>Some day my prince will come</i>
3470759 3475680 <i>Some day we'll meet again</i>
3476390 3482353 <i>And away to his castle we'll go</i>
3483230 3486732 <i>To be happy forever</i>
3486859 3488943 <i>I know</i>
3490028 3492238 Mush!
3492906 3498286 <i>Some day when spring is here</i>
3499204 3504458 <i>We'll find our love anew</i>
3505294 3510131 <i>And the birds will sing</i>
3511216 3515970 <i>And wedding bells will ring</i>
3517472 3522894 <i>Some day when my dreams</i>
3523562 3526939 <i>Come true</i>
3539578 3541537 Oh, my goodness!
3541622 3543539 It's past bedtime.
3543624 3545625 Go right upstairs to bed.
3547961 3550254 Wait! Hold on there, men!
3552007 3556344 The princess will sleep<br />in our beds upstairs.
3556428 3557970 But where will you sleep?
3558096 3562850 Oh, we'll be quite comfortable<br />down here in...
3562935 3564101 In a pig's eye!
3564186 3567355 In a pig's eye. Sty. No, no! I mean...
3567439 3570149 We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?
3570692 3573319 Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.
3573445 3576322 Now don't you worry about us.
3576448 3581452 - We'll be all right, ma'am.<br />- Go right on up now, my dear.
3581536 3583788 Well, if you insist.
3585791 3587333 Good night.
3587459 3589293 Good night, Princess.
3592506 3594257 You're sure you'll be comfortable?
3594341 3597635 Oh, yes. Very comfortable.
3598720 3600721 Well, pleasant dreams.
3601640 3603724 Pleasant dreams.
3608897 3609939 Let go!
3610023 3611857 - I saw it first!<br />- Now, men, don't get excited.
3611984 3614277 Remember, share.<br />It's share and share alike.
3614361 3616696 Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!
3631003 3634547 Bless the seven little men<br />who have been so kind to me.
3635424 3639093 And may my dreams come true.
3639678 3640845 Amen.
3642347 3645266 Oh, yes! And please make Grumpy like me.
3646435 3648102 Women!
3654026 3656444 A fine kettle of fish!
3760632 3763217 Dip the apple in the brew.
3764052 3767680 Let the Sleeping Death seep through!
3778483 3781402 Look! On the skin!
3781987 3785573 The symbol of what lies within.
3786324 3790911 Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.
3791329 3793747 To make her hunger for a bite.
3797043 3798669 Have a bite?
3801840 3803883 It's not for you.
3804342 3806260 It's for Snow White.
3807387 3810014 When she breaks the tender peel
3810515 3812850 to taste the apple in my hand,
3813226 3816687 her breath will still, her blood congeal.
3817272 3820441 Then I'll be fairest in the land!
3823403 3824862 But wait!
3826448 3828782 There may be an antidote.
3828867 3831035 Nothing must be overlooked.
3833455 3836040 Oh, here it is!
3846218 3848636 "Love's First Kiss."
3848803 3850054 Bah!
3850639 3852473 No fear of that.
3852974 3855434 The dwarfs will think she's dead.
3856061 3859063 She'll be buried alive!
3870492 3873118 Buried alive!
3884839 3886173 Thirsty?
3886800 3887841 Have a drink!
3948862 3950571 Now, don't forget, my dear.
3950655 3953324 The old queen's a sly one,
3953825 3955451 full of witchcraft.
3955535 3957745 So, beware of strangers.
3958246 3960914 Don't worry. I'll be all right.
3963335 3964418 See you tonight.

4098970 4100679 Goodbye, Grumpy!
4111524 4114651 The little men will be away
4114778 4117279 and she'll be all alone
4117822 4121325 with a harmless old peddler woman.
4123620 4126830 A harmless old peddler woman!
4136966 4141720 <i>Some day my prince will come</i>
4142514 4147476 <i>Some day we'll meet again</i>
4147560 4152397 <i>And away to his castle we'll go</i>
4153358 4157569 <i>To be happy forever I know</i>
4160365 4165160 <i>Some day when spring is here</i>
4165912 4170082 <i>We'll find our love anew</i>
4170708 4174753 <i>And the birds will sing</i>
4175713 4180092 <i>And wedding bells will ring</i>
4180510 4184763 <i>Some day when my dreams</i>
4185098 4187599 <i>Come true</i>
4195441 4197776 All alone, my pet?
4199070 4201405 Why, yes, I am. But...
4201531 4205117 The little men are not here?
4206119 4208203 No, they're not, but...
4211749 4213417 Making pies?
4214627 4216378 Yes, gooseberry pies.
4216462 4218714 It's apple pies
4218798 4222092 that make the menfolks' mouths water.
4223094 4227472 Pies made from apples like these.
4229976 4232561 - Oh, they do look delicious.<br />- Yes!
4232645 4236106 But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.
4240653 4241862 Like to try one?
4244824 4247993 Go on. Go on, have a bite.
4255627 4258337 Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away!
4258463 4261298 Shame on you, frightening a poor old lady.
4262967 4265010 Oh, I thought I'd lost it.
4267096 4269806 There, there. I'm sorry.
4270308 4272809 Oh! My heart!
4273519 4275854 Oh, my poor heart.
4276773 4279816 Take me into the house and let me rest.
4280485 4283028 A drink of water, please.
4313851 4315018 <i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>
4315144 4319356 <i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho<br />It's off to work we go</i>
4322068 4323694 <i>Heigh-ho, heigh-ho</i>
4338376 4339418 Hey, look!
4345091 4348343 - Stop that!<br />- Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!
4348428 4350262 Go on! Get outta here!
4355226 4357436 What ails these crazy birds?
4358229 4359688 They've gone plumb daffy.
4359772 4360939 Yeah, they've...
4367196 4371533 And because you've been so good<br />to poor old Granny,
4372118 4374745 I'll share a secret with you.
4375288 4377414 This is no ordinary apple.
4377915 4380125 It's a magic wishing apple.
4381252 4382961 A wishing apple?
4383087 4384421 Yes!
4384922 4389468 One bite and all your dreams<br />will come true.
4389927 4392554 - Really?<br />- Yes, girlie.
4393806 4395724 Now, make a wish
4396434 4398143 and take a bite.
4398603 4400896 - Go on, get!<br />- These pesky critters won't stop.
4400980 4402647 - 'Tain't natural.<br />- There's something wrong.
4402774 4405609 They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.
4406110 4409488 Maybe the old queen's got Snow White.
4409614 4411281 - The queen!<br />- Snow White!
4411407 4413784 The queen'll kill her! We gotta save her!
4413910 4416328 Yes! Yes! We gotta save her!
4416454 4417871 - She'll kill her!<br />- What'll we do?
4417955 4420165 Yes, yes, what'll we do?
4420291 4423502 Come on! Giddap!
4432929 4435430 Wait for me! Wait for...
4449654 4453865 There must be something<br />your little heart desires.
4454826 4457327 Perhaps there's someone you love.
4457954 4459913 Well, there is someone.
4459997 4462290 I thought so. I thought so!
4463876 4467254 Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.
4467338 4470215 Now, take the apple, dearie,
4470341 4471883 and make a wish.
4474345 4476805 I wish... I wish...
4476889 4479182 That's it, go on! Go on.
4492905 4495907 ...and that he will<br />carry me away to his castle
4497201 4500287 where we will live happily ever after.
4500371 4503331 Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.
4507753 4510005 Don't let the wish grow cold!
4511757 4514759 Oh, I feel strange.
4515720 4519848 Her breath will still.
4521017 4524227 Her blood congeal.
4534906 4538241 Now I'll be fairest in the land!
4546959 4548752 Hurry, hurry.
4554592 4556218 There she goes!
4576155 4577614 After her!
4606978 4609813 I'm trapped! What will I do?
4610648 4613066 The meddling little fools!
4617989 4621908 I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.
4621993 4625745 I'll fix ya! I'll crush your bones!
