151109 153945 Slave in the Magic Mirror,
154488 157491 come from the farthest space.
158283 160952 Through wind and darkness,<br />I summon thee.
162162 163372 Speak!
164915 167125 Let me see thy face.
169753 172255 What wouldst thou know, my Queen?
172964 175133 Magic Mirror on the wall,
175592 178303 who is the fairest one of all?
179471 182891 Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.
182974 187104 But hold, a lovely maid I see.
188188 191483 Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.
192651 197531 Alas, she is more fair than thee.
197614 201660 Alas for her! Reveal her name.
202452 204705 Lips red as the rose.
205330 207791 Hair black as ebony.
207874 210335 Skin white as snow.
211837 213338 Snow White!
248540 249624 Want to know a secret?
250834 252419 Promise not to tell?
252753 257215 We are standing<br />by a wishing well
258675 261344 Make a wish into the well
261428 264055 That's all you have to do
264181 267225 And if you hear it echoing
267350 270729 Your wish will soon come true
271772 275567 - I'm wishing<br />- I'm wishing
275692 278403 For the one I love
278528 281865 - To find me<br />- To find me
281948 284576 - Today<br />- Today
285035 288246 - I'm hoping<br />- I'm hoping
288705 291416 And I'm dreaming of
291541 294795 - The nice things<br />- The nice things
294878 297756 - He'll say<br />- He'll say
311102 314564 - I'm wishing<br />- I'm wishing
314648 317442 For the one I love
317567 320946 - To find me<br />- To find me
321071 324783 - Today<br />- Today
325617 327452 - Oh!<br />- Hello.
327577 329621 - Oh.<br />- Did I frighten you?
330413 332791 Wait! Wait, please.
333500 335418 Don't run away.
336127 339130 Now that I've found you
339256 343510 Hear what I have to say
344344 347013 One song
347097 350684 I have but one song
351476 356147 One song only for you
358316 364281 One heart tenderly beating
364781 368201 Ever entreating
368618 372706 Constant and true
373373 376293 One love
376376 380171 That has possessed me
380797 383675 One love
383800 388346 Thrilling me through
388471 391850 One song
391975 396229 My heart keeps singing
396313 399858 Of one love
400692 405864 Only for you
420420 422881 Take her far into the forest.
423506 426217 Find some secluded glade
426343 428845 where she can pick wildflowers.
429220 431056 Yes, Your Majesty.
431181 434935 And there, my faithful Huntsman,
435560 437395 you will kill her!
437520 440023 But, Your Majesty, the little Princess!
440106 441608 Silence!
442192 445904 You know the penalty if you fail.
447030 449532 Yes, Your Majesty.
450283 452702 But to make doubly sure
453370 455455 you do not fail,
456873 460752 bring back her heart in this.
469594 473264 One song,<br />I have but one song
488279 489990 Hello there.
490240 491950 What's the matter?
492575 494744 Where's your mama and papa?
495245 497414 Why, I believe you're lost.
498665 499958 Oh, please don't cry.
505463 507424 Come on, perk up.
508091 509926 Won't you smile for me?
510010 512137 That's better.
513304 515682 Your mama and papa can't be far.
517851 519519 There they are!
521521 523273 Can you fly?
524315 527152 Good-bye. Good-bye!
535285 537287 I can't, I can't do it.
538121 542375 Forgive me.<br />I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.
542792 544252 I don't understand!
544335 546963 She's mad, jealous of you!<br />She'll stop at nothing!
547047 549340 - But, but who?<br />- The Queen.
549466 550467 - The Queen?<br />- Now, quick, child, run.
551634 552969 Run away, hide!
553053 556056 In the woods! Anywhere!<br />Never come back!
556139 560018 Now, go. Go! Go!
560560 564230 Run! Run! Hide!
681931 683266 Oh!
687353 689439 Please don't run away.
690440 692192 I won't hurt you.
694611 697780 I'm awfully sorry.<br />I didn't mean to frighten you.
698281 701326 But you don't know<br />what I've been through.
701451 704120 And all because I was afraid.
704871 707790 I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.
709709 712212 What do you do<br />when things go wrong?
714380 716799 Oh! You sing a song!
745745 749791 With a smile and a song
749874 753294 Life is just like a bright, sunny day
753378 756714 Your cares fade away
757048 759384 And your heart is young
762887 766724 With a smile and a song
766849 770311 All the world seems to waken anew
770395 773564 Rejoicing with you
773690 776901 As the song is sung
779237 780571 There's no use in grumbling
781864 785243 When raindrops come tumbling
785743 789872 Remember you're the one
790415 795878 Who can fill the world with sunshine
796462 799590 When you smile and you sing
801050 804429 Everything is in tune and it's spring
804554 806848 And life flows along
808224 813104 With a smile and a song
818234 820695 I really feel quite happy now.
820778 823156 I'm sure I'll get along somehow.
823573 826075 Everything's going to be all right.
827243 830413 But I do need a place to sleep at night.
830913 834250 I can't sleep<br />in the ground like you
834959 837253 or in a tree the way you do.
838087 841924 And I'm sure no nest would possibly<br />be big enough for me.
843176 845595 Maybe you know where I can stay.
846095 847221 In the woods somewhere?
848931 850016 You do?
851601 853519 Will you take me there?
898815 900525 Oh, it's adorable!
901984 904070 Just like a doll's house.
918334 919919 I like it here.
931556 934684 Ooh, it's dark inside.
945278 947363 Guess there's no one home.
950950 952410 Hello?
953035 954537 May I come in?
957373 958458 Shh!
978478 979645 Oh!
983107 985151 What a cute little chair!
987737 990239 Why, there's seven little chairs!
990573 992825 Must be seven little children.
993409 997455 And from the look of this table,<br />seven untidy little children.
1000500 1003461 A pickaxe. A stocking, too!
1008132 1009509 And a shoe!
1014972 1017558 And just look at that fireplace.
1017642 1019519 It's covered with dust.
1026817 1029320 And look, cobwebs everywhere!
1029946 1032281 My, my, my!
1032365 1034617 What a pile of dirty dishes!
1036327 1039330 And just look at that broom!
1042291 1044961 Why, they've never swept this room.
1045836 1047421 You'd think their mother would...
1048839 1050967 Maybe they have no mother.
1052134 1053886 Then they're orphans.
1054637 1056347 That's too bad.
1057848 1059183 I know!
1059308 1061811 We'll clean the house<br />and surprise them.
1061894 1063854 Then maybe they'll let me stay.
1070820 1072989 Now, you wash the dishes.
1073364 1075324 You tidy up the room.
1075992 1078286 You clean the fireplace.
1078369 1080371 And I will use the broom.
1087253 1089755 Just whistle while you work
1092174 1096887 And cheerfully together<br />we can tidy up the place
1097013 1099098 So hum a merry tune
1101434 1106230 It won't take long when there's a song<br />to help you set the pace
1106355 1108566 And as you sweep the room
1108691 1110776 Imagine that the broom
1110860 1116073 Is someone that you love and soon<br />you'll find you're dancing to the tune
1116198 1120036 Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub.
1120119 1122580 When hearts are high the time will fly
1122705 1124915 So whistle while you work
1133215 1134383 Uh-uh, uh-uh!
1134467 1136260 Not under the rug.
1265931 1268142 So whistle while you work
1293209 1295503 We dig, dig, dig,<br />dig, dig, dig, dig
1295586 1297755 In our mine the whole day through
1297880 1302468 To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig<br />is what we like to do
1302551 1304720 It ain't no trick to get rich quick
1304804 1307014 If ya dig, dig, dig<br />with a shovel or a pick
1307097 1309433 - In a mine<br />- In a mine
1309558 1311769 - In a mine<br />- In a mine
1311894 1316440 Where a million diamonds<br />- Shine
1316565 1317566 We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
1318818 1319944 From early morn ‘til night
1321153 1325658 We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig<br />up everything in sight
1326909 1328285 We dig up diamonds by the score
1328410 1330496 A thousand rubies<br />Sometimes more
1331747 1332832 Though we don't know<br />what we dig ‘em for
1332915 1335167 We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig

1733607 1736485 Hey, someone stole our dishes!

1742366 1744284 My cup's been washed.
1744993 1746620 Sugar's gone.
1748956 1750332 Something's cooking.

3431345 3432930 The only one for me.
3433013 3435599 Was he strong and handsome?
3435682 3437434 Was he big and tall?
3437517 3441271 There's nobody like him<br />anywhere at all.
3441355 3443398 Did he say he loved ya?
3443523 3445525 Did he steal a kiss?
3445609 3448779 He was so romantic
3449613 3453784 I could not resist
3463293 3469049 Some day my prince will come

3510424 3515178 And wedding bells will ring

3796251 3797877 Have a bite?
3801047 3803091 It's not for you.
3803550 3805468 It's for Snow White.
3806594 3809222 When she breaks the tender peel
3809723 3812058 to taste the apple in my hand,
3812434 3815895 her breath will still, her blood congeal.
3816479 3819649 Then I'll be fairest in the land!
3822610 3824070 But wait!
3825655 3827991 There may be an antidote.
3828074 3830243 Nothing must be overlooked.
3832662 3835248 Oh, here it is!
3845425 3847844 "Love's First Kiss."
3848011 3849262 Bah!
3849846 3851681 No fear of that.
3852182 3854642 The dwarfs will think she's dead.
3855268 3858271 She'll be buried alive!
3869699 3872327 Buried alive!
3884047 3885382 Thirsty?
3886007 3887050 Have a drink!
3948069 3949779 Now, don't forget, my dear.
3949863 3952532 The... The old Queen's a sly one,
3953032 3954659 full of witchcraft.
3954742 3956953 So beware of strangers.
3957454 3960123 Don't worry. I'll be all right.
3962542 3963626 See you tonight.
3965795 3969132 Uh, yes. We... Well, c'mon, men.
3973636 3975305 Be awful careful
3975805 3979142 ‘cause if anything'd happen to you, I, I...
3979225 3983396 - Good-bye.<br />- Oh, gosh!
3984772 3987400 Hah! Disgustin'!
3988234 3991112 And be sure to watch out...<br />Towa... Towa...
3991237 3992739 Towa...
3993114 3994574 Watch out.
3995992 3997285 Thanks.
4026314 4028816 Well... All right.
4031444 4033738 But that's the last... Wha...
4035281 4037325 Oh, go on. Run along.
4038993 4041204 Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
4041287 4043164 It's off to work we go
4045792 4046793 Heigh-ho
4046918 4049003 Good-bye! Good-bye!
4050630 4054926 Now I'm warnin' ya.<br />Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house.
4055510 4058263 Why, Grumpy, you do care.
4082495 4083830 Hah!
4098177 4099887 Good-bye, Grumpy!
4110732 4113860 The little men will be away
4113985 4116487 and she'll be all alone
4117030 4120533 with a harmless old peddler woman.
4122827 4126039 A harmless old peddler woman!
4136174 4140928 Some day<br />my prince will come
4141721 4146684 Some day we'll meet again
4146768 4151606 And away to his castle we'll go
4152565 4156778 To be happy forever I know
4159572 4164369 Some day when spring is here
4165119 4169290 We'll find our love anew
4169916 4173961 And the birds will sing
4174921 4179300 And wedding bells will ring
4179717 4183971 Some day when my dreams
4184305 4186808 Come true
4194649 4196984 All alone, my pet?
4198277 4200613 Why, why, yes, I am. But...
4200738 4204325 The, the little men are not here?
4205326 4207412 No, they're not, but...
4207495 4208955 Mmm-hmm.
4210957 4212625 Making pies?
4213835 4215586 Yes, gooseberry pies.
4215670 4217922 It's apple pies
4218005 4221300 that make the menfolks' mouths water.
4222301 4226681 Pies made from apples like these.
4229183 4231769 - Oh, they do look delicious.<br />- Yes!
4231853 4235314 But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.
4239861 4241070 Like to try one?
4242321 4243364 Hmm?
4244031 4247201 Go on. Go on, have a bite.
4254834 4257545 Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away!
4257670 4260506 Shame on you,<br />frightening a poor old lady.
4262175 4264218 Oh, I thought I'd lost it.
4266304 4269015 There, there. I'm sorry.
4269515 4272018 Oh! My heart!
4272727 4275062 Oh, my... My poor heart.
4275980 4279025 Take me into the house and let me rest.
4279692 4282236 A drink of water, please.
4313059 4314227 Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
4314352 4318564 Heigh-ho, heigh-ho<br />It's off to work we go
4321275 4322902 Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
4337583 4338626 Hey, look!
4344298 4347552 - Stop that!<br />- Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!
4347635 4349470 Go on! Get outta here!
4354433 4356644 What ails these crazy birds?
4357436 4358896 They've gone plumb daffy.
4358980 4360147 Yeah, they've...
4366404 4370741 And because you've been<br />so good to poor old Granny,
4371325 4373953 I'll share a secret with you.
4374495 4376622 This is no ordinary apple.
4377123 4379333 It's a magic wishing apple.
4380459 4382169 A wishing apple?
4382295 4383629 Yes!
4384130 4388676 One bite and all your dreams<br />will come true.
4389135 4391762 - Really?<br />- Yes, girlie.
4393014 4394932 Now, make a wish
4395641 4397351 and take a bite.
4397810 4400104 - Go on, get!<br />- These pesky critters won't stop.
4400187 4401856 - 'Tain't natural.<br />There's something wrong.
4401981 4404817 They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.
4405318 4408696 Maybe the old Queen's<br />got Snow White.
4408821 4410489 - The Queen!<br />Snow White!
4410615 4412992 The Queen'll kill her!<br />We gotta save her!
4413117 4415536 Yes! Yes! We, we, we gotta save her!
4415661 4417079 - She'll kill her!<br />- What'll we do?
4417163 4419373 Yes, yes, what'll we do?
4419498 4422710 Come on! Giddap!
4432136 4434639 Wait for me! Wait for...
4448861 4453074 There must be something<br />your little heart desires.
4454033 4456535 Perhaps there's someone you love.
4457161 4459121 Well, there is someone.
4459205 4461499 I thought so. I thought so!
4463084 4466462 Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.
4466545 4469423 Now, take the apple, dearie,
4469548 4471092 and make a wish.
4473552 4476013 I wish... I wish...
4476097 4478391 That's it, go on! Go on.
4492113 4495116 And that he will carry me away<br />to his castle
4496409 4499495 where we will live happily ever after.
4499578 4502540 Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.
4506961 4509213 Don't let the wish grow cold!
4510965 4513968 On, I feel strange.
4514927 4519056 - Her breath will still.<br />- Oh. Oh.
4520224 4523436 - Her blood congeal.<br />- Oh.
4534113 4537450 Now I'll be fairest in the land!
4546167 4547960 Hurry, hurry.
4553799 4555426 There she goes!
4575362 4576822 After her!
4606185 4609021 I'm trapped! What will I do?
4609855 4612274 The meddling little fools!
4617196 4621117 I'll fix ya. I'll fix ya.
4621200 4624954 I'll fix ya! I'll crush your bones!
4626372 4627456 Look out!
4756001 4757836 One song
4757920 4759588 One song
4759672 4764176 I have but one song
4764301 4766845 - One song<br />- One song
4766971 4771684 - Only for you<br />- For you
4771809 4774770 One heart
4774853 4778524 Tenderly beating
4778857 4782361 Ever entreating
4782945 4788367 - Constant and true<br />- So true
4788450 4791787 - One love<br />- One love
4791870 4795874 That has possessed me
4796500 4799461 - One love<br />- One love
4799545 4804800 - Thrilling me through<br />- So frue
4804883 4808053 - One song<br />- One song
4808178 4812683 - My heart keeps singing<br />- Keeps singing
4813559 4818063 - Of one love<br />- One love
4818689 4824570 Only for you...
4851096 4856685 And away<br />to his castle you'll go
4857770 4862775 To be happy forever we know
4901146 4902606 Good-bye.
4905984 4907736 Good-bye, Grumpy.
4908445 4909988 Good-bye.
4917329 4918997 Oh, Dopey.
4923001 4924628 Good-bye!
4940853 4946108 Some day when spring is here
4946984 4951864 We'll find our love anew
4951989 4956118 And the birds will sing
4956201 4959955 And wedding bells will ring
4961165 4965127 Some day when my dreams
4965210 4968505 Come true!
