28654 30239 [PJ] <i>Tonight is</i><br /><i>the fucking night, okay?</i>
30322 33868 We've looked like shit for<br />years, and we are developing.
33951 35828 I would say I'm actually<br />mostly developed.
35911 39039 We're finally hot.<br />At least, according to me.
39123 40499 We're getting out there.
40583 42042 We're getting in the cooch,<br />my girl.
42126 44754 We are getting in the puss<br />and we're gettin' wet.
44837 46422 Man, speak for yourself.
46505 48549 Nobody's gonna wanna<br />fuck me this year,
48632 51069 just like nobody wanted to fuck<br />me last year or the year before.
51093 53471 Okay, well, I'm gonna talk<br />to Brittany.
53554 54555 I think that it's time.
54638 55765 Oh, really? It's time?
55848 58017 There wasn't time<br />in the last 11 years
58100 59619 we've all been going<br />to school together?
59643 60853 I've been building tension.
60936 62289 You know,<br />you could say hi to Isabel.
62313 63355 Yeah, okay.
63439 64857 And just what would I say?
64940 68319 Like, "Hey, girl, what's up?<br />How's your boyfriend?
68402 70154 How's his penis?
70237 73157 Still awesome and big and throbbing<br />and, uh, like a male penis?"
73240 74880 They could have broken up,<br />you never know.
74950 76660 The fair is like<br />a completely fresh start.
76744 79330 I'm not doin' that with<br />Isabel, you know what I mean?
79413 82583 Like, I'm... I'm... I'm playin'<br />the long game with her, okay?
82666 84585 -Mmm. -Here's how<br />it's gonna shake out.
84668 86879 I don't speak to the bitch<br />for years.
86962 90090 Bam! It's the 20th<br />high school reunion.
90174 91550 I show up, I'm in a little suit
91634 93636 like the lesbian I am,<br />you know what I mean?
93719 94845 It's probably white, okay?
94929 97348 She looks at me,<br />I look back at her.
97431 99433 What the fuck happened to her?
99517 101977 She's washed up.
102061 103938 I mean Jeff has run her ragged.
104021 107066 That's when my ass<br />swoops in, okay?
107149 110653 That made me so sad.<br />What? Okay.
110736 112154 Josie, tick-tock.
112238 114299 We're not gonna be sexy<br />little high schoolers forever.
114323 116200 Soon we're gonna be old hags<br />in college.
116283 118452 Do you wanna be the only<br />girl virgin at Sarah Lawrence?
118536 119537 Yeah, honestly, maybe.
119620 121121 I might have a good shot<br />that way.
121205 124500 I don't need this negative,<br />really sad attitude. Please.
125626 127253 What the fuck are you wearing?
129421 131590 It's really not too late<br />to turn around, you know?
131674 133384 I think you wanna be here.
133467 134802 Who said that?
134885 136363 - Where'd you get that idea?<br />- I'm just feeling...
136387 139473 You're getting nervous because<br />of how excited you are.
139557 141976 - No. No, no.<br />- Yeah, yeah.
142059 143912 Oh, and we're crossing.<br />And we're getting in there.
143936 146146 No, I can't, I'm sorry.<br />Ahhh! Fuck, my arm!
146230 147499 There's nothing wrong<br />with your arm.
147523 149024 You have Munchausen's.
149108 150734 Look, just follow my lead.
150818 152111 - Hello, ladies.<br />- [girl 1] Oh.
152194 153505 [girl 2 chuckles] Oh.<br />You know what?
153529 154756 - Just keep going.<br />- [PJ] How was your summer?
154780 156490 - Good to see you.<br />- Okay, you know what?
156574 157950 Uh, it's not gonna happen, okay?
158033 159952 This school has such<br />a gay problem.
160035 162538 Okay, no.<br />No one hates us for being gay.
162621 166125 Everyone hates us for being<br />gay, untalented, and ugly.
166208 168043 Like, look at Matthieu.
168127 169837 [boy] Rock on, man. Killin' it.
169920 172131 I love what you're doing<br />with the school play.
172214 173894 - Thanks, bitch.<br />- [Matthieu and boy chuckle]
174967 177136 - Fuck!<br />- Yeah.
177219 178697 Knocks it out of the park,<br />every year.
178721 180598 - Every show.<br />- Yeah.
180681 182933 - [Isabel giggles]<br />- [PJ] Ooh. Popcorn.
183017 184059 Don't mind if I do.
186312 188272 - [gentle music playing]<br />- [laughing]
195696 197990 - Hey, guys.<br />- Hi, Hazel.
198073 200326 Oh, hey, Hazel.<br />How was your summer?
200409 202536 Were you with your uncle<br />at the slop farm?
202620 204901 If you mean volunteering at<br />the National Meat Association,
205998 207374 yeah, it was good.
207458 208792 What are you guys doing here?
208876 209936 You guys never come to the fair.
209960 211170 What happened to your arm?
211253 213547 Oh, my God,<br />she ate shit is what happened.
213631 215031 She ate literal shit?<br />What the fuck?
215090 217176 - Mmm.<br />- Or did you get beat up again?
217259 218886 [Josie] No, I just tripped<br />and I...
218969 220888 Or were you jumped?<br />Was it spy camp?
220971 222431 Did you go to juvie?
222514 224117 - Yeah, we went to juvie.<br />- [man] <i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

244036 245412 - [crowd cheers]<br />- [PJ groans]
245496 247015 [PJ] I just don't get why girls<br />like guys like that.
247039 249750 It's like they're like dogs,<br />or pigs, or is there a...
249833 251210 What's the grossest animal?
252628 254296 [girl 5] Jeff,<br />come sign my tits!
254380 256465 - [whistle blows]<br />- [girl 6] Eat my pussy!

263555 265683 Gimme that.<br />Josie, take this. Take this.
265766 267184 - Take this.<br />- [Josie] No.
267267 268686 Really quick.<br />This is the moment.
268769 270562 Stop yelling at me!
270646 272206 Could you give that back<br />really quickly?
272648 273983 - Hey, Brittany.<br />- PJ.
274066 276694 [PJ] I am loving all the...
276777 278445 holes in your pants.
278529 279571 Thanks.
279655 281573 You look like<br />a little Dutch boy.
281657 282700 [PJ] Thank you.
282783 285035 So, Britt...<br />Can I call you Britt?
285119 287079 I prefer if you just<br />called me my name.
287162 289581 - Britt-a-nay. Um, but...<br />- [Brittany] No, not that.
289665 291208 [PJ] Brittany.
291291 292769 Are you thinking of riding the<br />Ferris wheel at all tonight?
292793 295212 I wasn't. I'm going<br />on the puke and duke.
295295 296296 I need to pull trig.
296380 297798 - No, you don't.<br />- Yeah, I do.
297881 299067 I'm gonna say something crazy.
299091 302636 I think you could eat food,
302720 305222 digest it, let it marinate,<br />poop it out.
305305 306557 Mmm, gross.
306640 308225 Maybe this?<br />You want a bite of this?
308308 310578 -[Brittany] Oh, no. -Yeah, this<br />is fucking disgusting. Ugh.
310602 312396 You want a hot dog?<br />We could go get hot dogs.
312479 313689 Oh, I don't know.
313772 315125 Yeah, we could get the bun<br />and the ketchup.
315149 317192 - No bun. No.<br />- You gotta get the bun.
317276 319028 - Yes, you could.<br />- No.
319111 321071 No bun. [clears throat] Okay.
321155 323365 Um, Isabel.
323449 325659 Josie was just saying<br />something similar to me.
325743 326827 I don't think so.
326910 328495 [PJ] I think so.<br />It was really good.
328579 329955 It was super funny.
331623 333500 [PJ clears throat]
333584 337463 You're just so...<br />You're skinny too, as well.
339131 340966 I'm Josie, by the way,<br />good evening.
341050 342718 Yeah, you're skinny...
342801 344237 You're real skinny minnie,<br />aren't ya?
344261 346180 You probably should eat.
346263 348658 They're gonna send you to the<br />hospital with how skinny you are.
348682 351101 Uh-oh, call the doctor.<br />Skinny girl, I see.
353437 354914 Okay, do you guys want<br />any of our tickets?
354938 356023 Yeah, yeah. Thank you.
357524 360778 [groans] Fuck! Fuck!
360861 362780 I don't want to say it,<br />but we're fucked.
362863 364323 You know what? I'm good.
364406 366325 'Cause it's not gonna happen<br />for me.
366408 367785 If it's not happening here,
367868 370537 then it's definitely not<br />happening at Emerson, okay?
370621 372748 I'm done trying to sow<br />my damn oats.
372831 374833 - No.<br />- I'm packing up my vagina
374917 376418 and I'm fucking Matthieu.
376502 377878 That's the only hope for me.
377961 379421 - No.<br />- It's me and Matthieu, man.
379505 380839 And 'cause he's gay<br />and fearless,
380923 382692 he's probably gonna fuck me<br />without protection.
382716 383842 Then I'm gonna get pregnant.
383926 384986 We're going to have<br />to join a church.
385010 386220 He'll be the gay pastor.
386303 387805 My whole life's fucked!
387888 389640 And yeah, sure,<br />his sermons are good,
389723 391391 but everybody knows he's fruity.
391475 393811 Everybody knows<br />he's fucking fruity!
393894 396522 By the way, our son, Hezekiah,<br />hates us
396605 398190 'cause he knows<br />we're both closeted,
398273 400393 but we try to make it work<br />for him, but he's not happy.
400442 401777 And yeah, guess what?
401860 404613 The deacon's fucking<br />the evangelist, man!
404696 406990 He's fucking the evangelist!
407074 409910 [crying] I don't wanna<br />live like that.
409993 412746 Will you come and visit us<br />on Sundays?
412830 416625 Please, will you come<br />and visit us on Sundays?
416708 419545 - [Jeff] Isabel.<br />- [Isabel] Leave me alone!
419628 420980 - Stop following me.<br />- Wait, shut up.
421004 422172 - What?<br />- Look.
422256 424049 - [Isabel] Don't touch me.<br />- Isabel, baby.
424133 425467 My teeny, tiny baby girl.
425551 427636 Why do you always have<br />to flirt with other women?
427719 429888 It doesn't count<br />if they're not in high school.
429972 431223 Especially Mrs. Reilly!
431306 433225 - Josie, offer her a ride.<br />- I don't think so.
433308 434309 Yes, come on.
434393 435853 Irish Catholic.
435936 437330 - And I'm regular Christian!<br />- [groaning in frustration]
437354 439082 - [PJ] Josie, ask her. Come on.<br />- [Josie] PJ, stop.
439106 440899 [Jeff grunts]<br />You're hurting my head.
440983 443360 You're attacking me,<br />and it's giving me a migraine.
443443 445797 And it's giving me PTSD about all<br />the other times I've had migraines.
445821 447656 - Just do it now.<br />- No.
447739 450379 -Just go fucking ask her. -No.<br />Isabel, would you like a safety ride?
450409 451410 Isabel.
452870 454246 - Oh, no.<br />- Oh, my God.
454329 455723 - [Jeff] Isabel...<br />- [Isabel breathes heavily]
455747 457166 Get out of the car.
457249 458500 You can't tell me what to do.
458584 460377 - Yeah, no, he can't.<br />- [Jeff] Okay,
460460 463422 I'm sorry that I looked<br />at Mrs. Reilly
463505 465549 and lightly grazed<br />her left tit, all right?
465632 467801 - Move, you prick!<br />- [groans]
467885 469845 Uh, excuse me,<br />she said, "Move, prick."
469928 471072 Don't talk to me,<br />you ugly bitch, okay?
471096 473765 I do not talk to girls<br />in overalls.
473849 476018 -Hey. -Okay, I might be ugly,<br />but these aren't overalls.
476101 478520 Isabel, get out<br />of the freaking car! Get out!
478604 480189 Get out! Come on.
480272 481416 -I feel like we should just drive.<br />-Drive.
481440 482649 - Drive.<br />- Let's just go.
482733 484294 Please. You're being<br />really mean right now.
484318 485569 - He'll move.<br />- He's not moving.
485652 486695 [Isabel] He's gonna move.
486778 488173 - [PJ] We're about to drive.<br />- Isabel.
488197 490115 - Drive. He'll move.<br />- [PJ] Just drive. Josie, go.
490199 492576 - Three, two one...<br />- Pedal to the metal. Drive!

505923 507341 Jeff!
507424 508693 -[Jeff groaning] -[Josie] Are you...<br />Are you okay?

511678 513180 You're not alone.<br />You're not alone.

519144 520371 - Man down! Man down!<br />- [Jeff] You!
520395 521647 [PJ] Oh, my God.
521730 523416 - I'm... I'm blacking out.<br />- No, stay with me.
523440 524650 [PJ] We should go. Let's go.
524733 526109 - Let's go.<br />- Yeah. Okay.
526193 527694 Let's just kind of peel on out.
527778 529255 - [Josie] Fine.<br />- What did you do to him?
529279 531114 Buckle it for me. Fuck!
531198 533450 - [Jeff wailing]<br />- You fucking cowards!
533533 534618 You better fucking run!
535744 538497 [Jeff] I don't understand.<br />What the fuck? [sobs]

637262 638990 - I hope you broke a bone.<br />- If you need a shoulder
639014 640557 or anything, just let me know...
640640 642160 I heard you did something to<br />him, I just don't know what.
642184 643411 and I'll totally let you<br />lean on me.
643435 645395 No, but like honestly,<br />how did you do it?
645479 647105 Oh, my God.<br />Annie, they went to juvie.
647189 648231 That's how, okay?
648315 650067 [Jeff] Hey. Hey. Hey, you.
650150 651610 Overall bitch.
651693 653445 This is you.
653528 655405 - [students gasp]<br />- God damn it, Jeff.
655489 656907 What the fuck?
656990 659368 Hey, you couldn't make<br />that analogy with your fists?
659451 660786 [PA chimes]
660869 663246 [over PA] <i>Hello,</i><br /><i>this is Principal Meyers</i>
663330 665165 <i>with an important<br />Huntington update.</i>
665248 666792 <i>So, listen to this girl.</i>
666875 669878 [Shelly] <i>Last night,</i><br /><i>outside the fair,</i>
669961 671671 <i>a Huntington player<br />followed me home,</i>

674966 677886 <i>And now my face<br />is totally fucked.</i>
677969 680055 [Sylvie] Fuck.
680138 681866 [Principal Meyers] <i>We haven't faced the<br />violence of Huntington for 20 years.</i>
681890 683475 <i>They think they can get<br />in our heads</i>
683558 685685 <i>by picking on our weak<br />and defenseless.</i>
685769 687622 <i>Well, we can't let them<br />break our spirit, folks.</i>
687646 689272 <i>Keep your heads in the game.</i>
689356 690357 They're gonna pork us!
690440 691775 - We're fucked!<br />- I'm screwed.
691858 693169 Hey. Hey, calm down<br />just a little bit.
693193 694793 [sarcastically]<br />Oh, great. More violence.
694861 695922 Just what this school needs.
695946 697280 [bell rings]
697364 698615 Seriously, that's...<br />that's it?
698698 700659 - That's class?<br />- Latte. [snaps fingers]
700742 701743 Get my shit.
701827 703620 [PJ] Solid class.
703703 704955 [Hazel groans]
705038 706164 [Isabel] Hey.
707582 710168 Josie, right?
710252 713630 I heard you, like, beat up<br />my boyfriend last night?
714423 717676 Um, weren't you there?
717759 719636 I heard you guys ate<br />literal shit
719719 722013 - and killed girls in juvie.<br />- [PJ] Really?
722097 724474 Um, what did you think<br />about that?
724558 726077 - [PA chimes]<br />- [Principal Meyers] <i>Excuse me.</i>
726101 728728 <i>Could the ugly, untalented gays</i>
728812 730689 <i>please report<br />to the principal's office?</i>
730772 732691 Guess that's you guys.
732774 735318 Hello, Principal Meyers. First of<br />all, I want to say, God bless...
735402 737946 - Shut up. You know why you're here.<br />- I don't, actually...
738029 739656 For committing a crime<br />against Jeff.
739739 742117 Our quarterback<br />and the most good-looking,
742200 744953 all-American, red-blooded, muscular<br />man this town has ever seen.
745036 746097 Sir, please, look in the mirror.
746121 747706 - Shush.<br />- Okay.
747789 752127 The homecoming game with<br />Huntington is nearly a month away.
752210 753563 Do you know how long we've<br />been working toward this?
753587 755255 - Yes.<br />- Yes. It's everywhere.
755338 756607 - [Josie] Twenty years.<br />- [PJ] Couldn't be clearer.
756631 757692 [Josie] I think I can explain.
757716 758967 I can explain.
759050 761011 Jeff is psychotic,<br />and he tried to murder us.
761094 762512 [Principal Meyers] Ha! Sure.
762596 764973 You're all victims, and girls<br />are always right. Right?
765056 766308 Yeah, actually.
766391 768393 How come you can't buck up
768477 771104 and learn to protect yourselves<br />without running somebody over?
771188 774274 Maybe it's because we're small<br />and he's giant.
774357 777027 So, we needed to use<br />a little machinery.
777110 778612 Did you ever think of that, sir?
778695 780840 - Can we just explain ourselves?<br />- Maybe I should buy a gun.
780864 783116 Okay. What? What? Don't buy a gun.<br />Nobody said buy a gun.
783200 785118 -Can we just calm down, everybody.<br />-Zip it.
785202 786828 - You know what?<br />- What?
786912 789372 - I'm gonna expel you both.<br />- No!
789456 790957 - No! No!<br />- [Principal Meyers] Yes! Yes!
791041 794461 You have to understand that<br />this was a misunderstanding.
794544 797672 - Really?<br />- We were just practicing...
799466 800800 for...
805722 806762 for our self-defense club.
809184 810894 Self-defense... What is that?
810977 813355 - [Josie] Uh...<br />- Is it like a fight club?
813438 815398 - Well, here's the thing...<br />- Yes! Yes!
815482 817359 - Uh...<br />- Yes! Yes!
817442 818693 A fight club.
818777 821196 Where we fuckin' beat<br />each other up and shit.
821279 822280 - No, we don't.<br />- Yes.
822364 823657 No, we don't. Shut up.
823740 825176 Okay, you know what?<br />I don't care. Fuck it!
825200 826552 - I don't care.<br />- You're over it, okay.
826576 828537 Yeah. You can beat the shit<br />out of each other
828620 830330 while you perform<br /><i>The Vagina Monologues.</i>
830413 833041 Just stay in your lane until<br />you're munching beaver at Wesleyan.
833124 834876 Yes, sir.
834960 837271 [Hazel] I can't believe they're<br />letting you guys start a fight club.
837295 839589 No, they're... they're not.<br />We are not.
839673 841150 What are you talking about?<br />We're gonna do it.
841174 842175 We're doing it.
842259 844094 PJ, I wasn't being serious.
844177 847681 Josie, did you see the way that Isabel<br />and Brittany were looking at us?
847764 850475 -[Josie groans] -Also, you<br />heard the announcements.
850559 851685 Girls are terrified.
851768 853395 It's perfect. They need this.
853478 856022 Okay, no. They need,<br />like, mace, maybe.
856106 859234 We can't do that, okay?<br />We'd be misleading them.
859317 860545 Guys do that all the time, okay?
860569 861712 That's the point of feminism.
861736 863029 That's not the point<br />of feminism.
863113 864906 You also don't care<br />about feminism.
864990 866230 Your favorite show is <i>Entourage.</i>
866283 867742 You're missing the point!
867826 869804 I don't really think I am.<br />We don't know how to fight.
869828 871347 You guys probably<br />fought girls in juvie.
871371 873081 No, we were lying about that,<br />obviously.
873164 874583 - [grunts frustratedly]<br />- About juvie?
874666 876477 - [PJ] Yeah, I mean, what?<br />- Why would you lie to me?
876501 877895 You were the one who said<br />we went to juvie.
877919 879254 I just didn't correct you.
879337 881548 Listen, self-defense<br />is instinctual common sense.
881631 883871 You try to punch me in the<br />face, I stop it from happening.
883925 886011 Whatever. I don't care.<br />It's easy.
886094 888263 Look, this is how we do this.
888346 889681 Okay, we start with Taekwondo.
889764 891057 Which I've got covered.
891141 893184 And then you guys can move<br />on to air punches.
893268 894269 [PJ] Hub-bub-bub-bub.
894352 895854 Who do we know?<br />Who do we know?
895937 897105 I'll bring Stella-Rebecca.
897188 898708 [Josie and PJ]<br />You know Stella-Rebecca?
898732 900452 Stella-Rebecca who models<br />at car conventions
900483 902587 - in Chicago on the weekends?<br />- Yeah, we're family friends.
902611 904696 Okay, great.<br />Well, then bring her.
904779 905780 [Josie sighs]
905864 907532 - Josie.<br />- What?
907616 909034 - We're doing this.<br />- No.
909117 910744 Yeah. Listen to me.
910827 912555 We teach a bunch of girls<br />how to defend themselves
912579 915498 against the evil,<br />Huntington killers.
915582 917167 They are grateful to us.
917250 919711 We build a community, we bond,
919794 921963 we share, we connect.
922047 924966 We're punching each other,<br />adrenaline is flowing.
925050 926426 Next thing you know,
926509 928237 Isabel and Brittany<br />are kissing us on the mouths.
928261 929621 - [player 1] Jeffrey!<br />- [PJ] Josie...
930680 932766 Isabel knew your name.
932849 934851 - [player 2] Back from the dead.<br />- If we do this...
934934 937062 - Mmm-hmm.<br />- Very big "if,"
937145 938688 we just run the risk of becoming
938772 940666 even bigger losers<br />than we already are right now.
940690 943010 And I hate to break it to you,<br />but we're pretty big losers.
943068 945320 And that is the beauty.<br />That is the beauty of this.
945403 947989 Because we are literally<br />at the bottom.
948073 949193 We're the lowest of the low.
949240 950700 - Okay.<br />- We have nowhere to go but up.
950784 953828 Listen, I think this is<br />a good idea, okay?
953912 956498 There's a serious lack of female<br />solidarity at this school.
956581 958708 Not the point, Hazel.<br />Not the point.
958792 961211 Yeah, I mean, we just felt like
961294 963838 there's a serious lack of female<br />solidarity at this school.
965048 967717 Anyways, totally come by.<br />See you later.
969010 970762 What's your plan here?
970845 972472 I don't need a plan.
972555 974599 My mom has a business.<br />All we have to do is yell.
975684 977060 [upbeat electronic<br />music playing]
978186 979354 [PJ sighs]
980814 981940 Okay.
982023 983149 What's up, lads?
984317 985402 What the fuck?
985485 987487 - These girls are ugly.<br />- [Josie] Okay.
987570 988988 Where is Stella?
989072 990615 She was booked<br />for a car convention.
990699 992242 What? It's a Monday.
992325 993910 [Josie] Um, maybe we should go
993993 995179 - before someone cool shows up?<br />- [door opens]
995203 996705 Before I die? Pick one.
996788 999290 [Sylvie] Hey, Hazel.<br />Thanks for the invite.
999374 1001251 I love David Fincher.
1001334 1003795 - [sighs] Oh, my God. Well...<br />- See?
1003878 1006798 I guess Sylvie's cute<br />if she lost her braces
1006881 1008383 and stopped huffing paint.
1008466 1010218 [Josie] She'll never stop<br />huffing paint.
1010301 1011445 [Hazel] So, I thought<br />we'd start...
1011469 1012470 Um...
1013430 1014431 - Okay.<br />- Sorry.
1015473 1016683 [PJ] All right.
1016766 1019936 Listen up, you cunt-sucking<br />pieces of shit.
1020019 1021688 Welcome to our fucking<br />fight club.
1021771 1023523 Um, it's a self-defense club.
1023606 1024858 It's not really, "Fight."
1024941 1028445 So, as we know,<br />Huntington is on the prowl,
1028528 1030155 and they're picking on the weak
1030238 1032824 and defenseless,<br />meaning all of you.
1032907 1035535 So, we're gonna teach you<br />how to not take shit.
1035618 1037704 We're gonna start<br />with dropkicks,
1037787 1039998 tackling, little bit<br />of knife play.
1040081 1041666 Then, punch-bucket,
1041750 1043668 which is when we throw you<br />in a bucket
1043752 1045837 and we punch you<br />until you bleed.
1045920 1049883 Before that, perhaps stretches,<br />icebreakers, and trust falls.
1049966 1051152 Is that what happened<br />to you in juvie?
1051176 1053219 - Mmm. No. No.<br />- No.
1053303 1055305 Juvie was way crazier.
1055388 1057390 One time, this girl's<br />punching me in the rain.
1057474 1059517 Fall to my knees. It's muddy.
1059601 1062353 I get up. I'm blind.
1062437 1064731 Punch her right<br />in the middle of her face.
1065690 1066691 Broke her fuckin' nose.
1067567 1068568 Josie?
1068651 1069736 Care to share?
1072238 1073364 Yeah, all right.
1074908 1076201 Juvie was insane.
1076284 1079537 Once a girl tried to kill me<br />with rat poison,
1079621 1082457 so I took her outside and I<br />punched her till she died.
1084501 1085877 So, you killed a girl?
1085960 1087754 Uh, no.
1087837 1090924 Because the ambulance came<br />and revived her
1091007 1093259 and we actually had a really<br />productive conversation
1093343 1095220 when she came back<br />to life, so...
1095303 1098056 Um, since Josie<br />literally killed a girl...
1098139 1099849 She came back to life.
1099933 1102519 Mmm. But I remember her being dead<br />for at least a couple minutes.
1102602 1104521 Josie is gonna start<br />by showing you all
1104604 1106689 how to effectively throw<br />a solid punch.
1106773 1108066 Josie, if you'll step forward.
1109067 1110443 No, I don't wanna do that.
1110527 1112505 - What's the problem?<br />- There's no problem. I just...
1112529 1114030 No, I'm just not gonna do it.
1114113 1115615 Come on, they wanna see<br />the punch.
1115698 1117843 - They don't wanna see it.<br />- They wanna see. Look at them.
1117867 1119118 They wanna see the punch.
1119202 1120203 Who am I gonna punch?
1120286 1121579 Punch me. Just punch me.
1121663 1123248 - Punch you?<br />- Yeah, come on.
1123331 1124332 I can punch you.
1124415 1125834 Yeah. I know how<br />to take a punch.
1125917 1127237 Something people<br />would always say,
1127293 1128395 "PJ knows how<br />to take a punch."
1128419 1129587 - Come on up.<br />- [Josie grunts]
1129671 1131840 Oh! [groans, thuds]
1132674 1133675 Oh, fuck!
1135134 1136970 - [Josie sighs]<br />- [PJ breathing heavily]
1141015 1142368 Will there an advisor<br />for this club?
1142392 1144060 Because we'll be suspended<br />if there isn't.
1144143 1146145 Who is gonna be dumb enough<br />to endorse a club
1146229 1148147 where we punch each other<br />in the face?
1149482 1152110 The Holocaust. It happened.
1153319 1154863 Yes, it did.
1154946 1157949 But how? The seeds were sown<br />in the <i>Treaty of Versailles,</i>
1158032 1160869 which y'all are gonna reenact while<br />I do some little reading over here.
1160952 1162787 [PJ] I mean, he's perfect.
1163621 1164873 [Josie] No.
1164956 1166165 - What?<br />- No.
1166249 1167750 Please.
1167834 1169562 Dude, we're not fucking doing this.<br />I broke your nose.
1169586 1171438 Yeah, and I've never had so many<br />girls look at me in my life.
1171462 1172672 Fuck! When did you show up?
1172755 1174173 Hey, guys. [chuckles]
1174257 1176718 I just wanted to say thank you<br />so much for last night.
1176801 1179762 It was just so great,<br />and I was thinking,
1179846 1181615 like, if Huntington and me were<br />in an alleyway
1181639 1184684 and they were coming at me with,<br />like, swords and, like, knives
1184767 1186477 and, like, guns and stuff,
1186561 1189689 and you taught me how to punch<br />like that, then I wouldn't die.
1189772 1192191 - That's so great, Sylvie.<br />- Okay.
1192275 1193443 But, unfortunately,
1193526 1195166 Josie doesn't want<br />to do the club anymore.
1195236 1196946 What? Why?
1197030 1198031 I don't know.
1198114 1199824 Why? It was just<br />so empowering.
1199908 1201117 What was empowering?
1201200 1204078 - Oh, my God, hi. Um...<br />- [players groaning]
1204162 1206331 Just, we have a fight club.<br />It was our fight club
1206414 1209459 for, um, female solidarity<br />at this school, which we lack.
1209542 1211961 - [bell rings]<br />- Isabel, let's go.
1216549 1219052 [Isabel giggles] Hi, boo-boo.
1219135 1220511 - I'm so strong.<br />- [Isabel giggles]
1220595 1222555 [whimsical music playing]
1224140 1225141 I mean...
1226100 1227477 [chuckling mischievously]
1229395 1232607 - [PJ] Mr. G, G-man, G-dog.<br />- [Josie sighs]
1232690 1234108 Great class today.
1234192 1236110 Hey, uh, girl.
1236194 1237612 Thanks for coming in today.
1237695 1239906 We have to come in.<br />It's class.
1239989 1242116 Try telling Dimitri Walker that.
1242200 1245453 Little motherfucker came the first<br />week and I ain't seen him since.
1245536 1247038 Dimitri Walker committed suicide
1247121 1248790 the first week of school,<br />Mr. G.
1248873 1251292 [chuckles] Sure, he did.
1251376 1255713 Anyways, um, we were wondering if<br />you wanted to be our club advisor.
1255797 1257924 - What kind of club is that?<br />- [PJ] It's a women's club.
1258007 1259801 We talk about women's issues.
1260802 1262971 For example, periods,
1263763 1265098 declining egg count,
1265181 1266265 skirts...
1266349 1267517 Skirts?
1267600 1270395 But long ones.<br />Long denim skirts.
1270478 1273690 Feminism is what she's saying.<br />Feminism as a... as a whole.
1273773 1275775 Why don't you just ask<br />one of the female teachers?
1275858 1277419 Mmm. Thought about that,<br />but we hate them.
1277443 1278361 - Makes sense.<br />- [PJ] Yeah.
1278444 1280113 Listen. I'm kind of,
1280196 1282365 you know, retiling the bathroom.
1282448 1285034 - [PJ] Mmm-hmm.<br />- Uh, I gotta be at the co-op.
1285118 1288037 And I'm also dealing with<br />some relationship drama, so...
1288121 1289831 Back to the club,
1289914 1291767 maybe this will be a great way<br />to take your mind off of stuff.
1291791 1293418 [Josie] Can I be honest?<br />You're a man
1293501 1295044 who's not coping<br />with what's going on.
1295128 1296504 - Yeah.<br />- You know what?
1296587 1299132 My mom did say I need<br />to pick up a hobby.
1299215 1300341 And here's one thing
1300425 1301735 - my mom's always said to me.<br />- [PJ] Mmm.
1301759 1304804 Sometimes, when you have<br />a new hobby,
1304887 1306431 - don't show up.<br />- Yeah.
1306514 1308766 [Josie] It's, like, you can be<br />our club advisor,
1308850 1310685 -but you don't even come<br />to the dang club. -No.
1310768 1312812 By the way,<br />great way to be an ally.
1312895 1314123 That's my favorite way<br />to be an ally.
1314147 1316232 You just say<br />you're doing something
1316315 1317984 and then you don't do<br />any of those things.
1318067 1320212 You know what I mean? You say,<br />"I support women." You don't.
1320236 1321779 Don't come. Yeah.
1321863 1325575 You know what? I'll sign off<br />on your period club.
1326409 1327618 - Amazing.<br />- What?
1327702 1328870 - Yeah.<br />- Really?
1328953 1330163 - Okay.<br />- [PJ] So cool.
1330913 1331914 [grunts]
1336002 1338046 How many girls go<br />to this school, again?
1338129 1341799 Oh, my God, and again,<br />they're all sixes at best.
1341883 1343051 Hey, guys.
1344552 1346846 [PJ] Mmm. Well, at least<br />Stella-Rebecca is here.
1346929 1349974 Are you stressed?<br />Because I'm stressed.
1350058 1352018 [Mr. G] Hey, ladies.
1352101 1354103 Let's get it popping<br />in this motherfucker.
1355146 1356314 All right. Um...
1357607 1358608 Hello, everybody.
1359275 1360693 Okay, excuse me.
1360777 1362153 Sorry, I feel... Sorry.
1362236 1363446 Um...
1363529 1365031 [loud thumping]
1366824 1368618 Everybody, shut the fuck up!
1376626 1379253 This isn't a little<br />hangout, okay?
1380588 1383758 Oh, it's not a sleepover,<br />playtime.
1383841 1388179 There are serious rules that<br />we need to establish, 'kay?
1389972 1391057 First...
1392391 1393392 listen.
1393893 1394894 Second,
1395978 1398648 be on time.
1399690 1401275 Yeah.
1401359 1403039 Except for you.<br />You come whenever you want.
1404695 1406197 What time is it?
1406280 1407990 - [Annie] 3:30.<br />- 3:30!
1408074 1410618 Club starts at 3:15.
1411869 1413204 Not 3:16.
1414163 1416874 [scoffs] Not 3:17,
1416958 1421420 but the doors close at 3:15.
1421504 1423172 No exceptions.
1424173 1425883 I don't care if you're like...
1425967 1428719 -[door opens] -"Oh, but I had<br />to go to extra help for math
1428803 1432515 because I... I need<br />to get a full ride
1432598 1434058 because my mom<br />lives in a trailer
1434142 1436310 and she loves her boyfriend<br />more than me."
1436394 1438479 La, la, la. Blah, blah, blah.
1438563 1440106 Shut up, okay?
1440189 1443693 My dad left me,<br />and I'm incredibly punctual.
1450575 1452660 Um, hey, guys. Come on in.
1452743 1453953 Nice.
1454036 1455913 [PJ] Uh, we're just getting<br />started here.
1455997 1457540 So, um...
1459292 1461353 Today I think we're gonna<br />start with some body contact.
1461377 1463045 We're gonna do wrestling.
1463129 1465339 I think I need a volunteer.
1465423 1467091 Brittany, you're close to me.<br />You wanna...
1467175 1469177 I'm sorry. I thought<br />we weren't allowed to be late.
1469260 1471620 - That's not true. It's about...<br />- Oh, that's about next week.
1471679 1472990 - Yeah, next week.<br />- So, the rules for next week.
1473014 1474348 Don't be late.
1474432 1475659 - But this week is good...<br />- [PJ] Yeah. No worries.
1475683 1476910 if you're late.<br />Take it easy.
1476934 1478120 Okay, I'm sorry.<br />I just want to make sure.
1478144 1480062 This is a self-defense<br />class, right?
1480146 1481373 Where we can learn<br />to protect ourselves
1481397 1482940 against, like, football players.
1483024 1486027 And Huntington? 'Cause, um,<br />they're gonna pork us.
1486110 1488446 [chuckles nervously, sighs]<br />They're gonna pork us.
1488529 1490531 I thought we were fighting<br />each other for money.
1490615 1491949 There's a cash prize, right?
1492033 1493913 [Isabel] I thought this was<br />to be part of, like,
1493993 1496245 a local underprivileged<br />female community.
1498164 1500124 My identity is completely<br />attached to hers,
1500208 1502752 so I just kind of go<br />wherever she goes.
1502835 1503979 Everyone's here<br />for a good reason.
1504003 1505463 So, uh, you know, like...
1505546 1509050 - Why are we nitpicking reasons?<br />- Yeah. How about this?
1509133 1511052 - Let's jump in. Right?<br />- Yeah. For sure.
1511135 1512470 - Love that.<br />- [PJ] Yeah.
1512553 1514513 - I'll go.<br />- Great. Yeah.
1518601 1521312 - [Annie grunts]<br />- Hey, hey, hey, hey. hey.
1521395 1522647 I don't know about this shit.
1522730 1525066 What the hell?<br />You didn't even warn me.
1525149 1527151 Okay, we didn't get<br />warnings at juvie.
1527235 1528629 - Look.<br />- [Josie] We can take it slower.
1528653 1530013 - [PJ] Okay.<br />- Maybe, yeah, try that.
1530071 1531614 Take that route.<br />Little slower.
1531697 1534158 Look. You just use your natural<br />instincts, just come at me.
1534242 1535368 Whatever you want, 'kay?
1536494 1537578 - [PJ grunts]<br />- Oh, fuck.
1537662 1538913 - [girls gasp]<br />- [PJ] Okay.
1538996 1541540 That's great.<br />I say that we go again.
1541624 1543209 - Oh!<br />- [Annie] Ow, fuck! My back.
1543292 1545294 Oh, shit.<br />Man, we gotta shut this down.
1545378 1546939 We don't have to shut it down.<br />She's fine.
1546963 1548565 - Are you fine? Are you okay?<br />- Yeah, she's okay.
1548589 1550424 - She's totally fine.<br />- Shut this shit down.
1550508 1552426 - [Josie] No, wait, Mr. G.<br />- Shut this shit down.
1552510 1553904 No, don't blow the whistle.<br />Don't blow the whistle.
1553928 1555763 I know that,
1555846 1558641 you know, this is<br />a little messy right now
1558724 1560685 but, like, the only way
1560768 1564063 that we can learn how to defend<br />ourselves is by teaching each other.
1565690 1567441 Huntington is coming.
1567525 1569151 [inspirational music playing]
1569235 1570319 We need this.
1571862 1574865 I know that things<br />might seem scary,
1574949 1577034 but that's okay, because...
1579078 1580121 because...
1580204 1583207 Because you're gonna<br />be fucking pros.
1583291 1584875 - Is what I was gonna say. Yes.<br />- Yeah.
1584959 1586294 - Right?<br />- [Josie] Yes.
1586377 1588546 Crystal, I'm thinking of you.
1588629 1591507 You are never gonna get<br />assaulted on your birthday again.
1591590 1593259 - Lucky number seven, okay?<br />- Mmm-hmm.
1593342 1596804 And I... I'm gonna finally<br />reverse-stalk my stalker.
1596887 1598389 Yeah, absolutely.
1598472 1599557 [Sylvie] And for me,
1599640 1601392 I'll be able to kill my stepdad.
1602768 1603853 - Awesome.<br />- Okay.
1603936 1605247 [PJ] And if you believe<br />in yourselves
1605271 1607481 and you believe in us<br />and then you trust us,
1607565 1609567 I'm like,<br />"Let's fucking do this!"
1609650 1611027 - Yeah!<br />- [Josie] Yeah?
1611110 1613154 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah. Okay.
1613237 1614613 So good.
1614697 1617116 - [girls cheering]<br />- [Sylvie] Yeah! Yes!
1617199 1618451 - Yeah!<br />- [Sylvie yells] Yeah!
1620119 1623289 Yes! Yes, queen, slay!
1623372 1625416 Yes! Yes!

1629920 1631297 ["Pain" by<br />King Princess playing]
1631380 1632381 Cool.
1633591 1635384 - [Josie] Yeah?<br />- Yeah. I'm just gonna go.
1635468 1636594 Yeah, for sure.

1803093 1804853 we can actually take on<br />Huntington, you guys.
1804929 1807598 No, if we keep it up,<br />we can put our fingers
1807681 1809475 inside of each other. Grow up.
1809558 1810601 All right.
1810684 1812186 You know, PJ,
1812269 1814122 I feel like people are<br />actually liking more than just
1814146 1816106 the hitting and the tackling<br />part of the club.
1816190 1818484 Yeah, I know.<br />We're empowering them. Duh.
1818567 1821403 No, I mean, seriously, to<br />have a safe space like this,
1821487 1822988 it means a lot to people,
1823072 1825449 and I think that if we took<br />some time to spend a meeting
1825533 1827201 and actually get<br />to know these girls,
1827284 1829703 like, it would be<br />really important,
1829787 1831872 instead of just, like,<br />sweating on them and...
1835125 1839547 Hazel, that is a genuinely<br />brilliant idea.
1839630 1841131 -Yeah. -I love talking<br />about my trauma.
1841215 1845344 I literally jack off<br />after every single
1845427 1846637 - therapy session.<br />- What?
1846720 1849431 It just makes girls<br />weirdly horny. It does.
1849515 1850742 - Don't say "girls." It's you.<br /><i>- Bonjour.</i>
1850766 1852810 - [Josie groans]<br />- I just wanted to say
1852893 1855062 I'm loving what I'm hearing<br />about the club.
1855145 1856564 It seems so supportive of women.
1857481 1858774 Especially the hot ones.
1858857 1860609 Yeah, well,<br />all women are hot to me.
1860693 1862570 Listen, it's really cute<br />and everything,
1862653 1867575 but we're getting a little<br />close to the game now and, um...
1867658 1868909 I'm just a bit concerned
1868993 1871036 it might be taking away<br />attention from our team.
1871120 1875374 I think that's, like,<br />literally impossible to do.
1877543 1878544 Okay.
1882172 1884925 [Josie] So, we know<br />that the club has been a place
1885009 1886969 where we can feel<br />empowered physically,
1887052 1889763 but we also thought it could be
1889847 1892433 a safe space and a place<br />where we can open up
1892516 1893892 and talk about our feelings.
1895728 1897646 Okay, so who's been raped?
1898731 1899971 Just, you know, raise your hand.
1902109 1903736 Gray area stuff counts too.
1909408 1911869 Everybody knows the situation<br />with my stepdad.
1913912 1919001 He's just obsessed<br />with Friday movie nights.
1919084 1922838 I mean, God, I get it,<br />you're my new stepdad, but...
1923631 1924632 fuck, whatever.
1924715 1926258 You know?
1926342 1928594 Every time I call the police<br />about my stalker,
1928677 1930804 they tell me to fill out<br />an online form.
1930888 1932890 And then the form<br />tells me to call,
1932973 1936185 so I call and then they say they can't<br />get involved until he tries to kill me.
1936268 1937668 And he keeps saying<br />he's going to...
1938520 1939605 but that doesn't count.
1939688 1941690 So, it's just, like, annoying.
1941774 1943067 Been there.
1944193 1945527 We've all been there.
1945611 1948322 Well, I've been assaulted,<br />like, a million times,
1948405 1950616 but I'm more annoyed
1950699 1954912 that everyone knows me for<br />being beautiful and popular
1954995 1957998 and no one knows that I'm<br />actually smart and super driven.
1958082 1961919 Like, I literally own a jewelry<br />business and no one talks about it!
1963629 1965005 See?
1965089 1967633 [Hazel] Well, ever since<br />my parents' divorce,
1967716 1970594 my mom has been doing this,<br />like, midlife crisis.
1970678 1973263 I don't know how that's really<br />sitting with me, you know?
1973347 1975182 It's been really, really dark.
1975265 1977243 This has just been really<br />meaningful to me to, like,
1977267 1981689 get to know some new people who<br />actually want to, like, get to know me.
1981772 1984412 -I want to bring it back to Brittany<br />for one second. -I can go next,
1985025 1986235 if that's okay.
1988320 1992241 I don't really like talking<br />about juvie
1992324 1995160 and everything that happened<br />this summer, um...
1995244 1998330 You know, obviously, we get<br />a lot of props or whatever
1998414 1999774 'cause people think<br />it's so badass.
2000999 2003627 But, really wasn't.
2003711 2008298 I mean, unless you consider getting<br />hazed horrifically every single night,
2008382 2010634 like, badass. I mean, um,
2010718 2014012 obviously, you know,<br />we had to survive the Tributes
2014096 2016098 and, you know,<br />I did have to, like,
2016181 2018142 fight people basically<br />every single night.
2018225 2021353 People were betting on us<br />and we were given, like,
2021437 2024815 shivs and rusty pocket knives<br />and splintered wood
2024898 2027151 and, um, pipes as well.
2027234 2030362 And, um, we had to just, like, fight<br />people, sometimes to the death.
2030446 2032197 Um, and I still hear<br />their screams at night,
2032281 2035492 um, and that guilt probably will,<br />like, always shackle me forever.
2037286 2040664 I realize now, I don't have<br />to be that person anymore.
2040748 2043500 Like, I don't have<br />to just let things
2043584 2047087 happen to me 'cause of you guys.
2047171 2050090 And, um, I am,<br />like, really grateful
2050174 2052676 for what the club<br />has become and...
2052760 2054386 Um...
2054470 2056930 Just especially, you know, from<br />where we started and, uh...
2058807 2060058 Yeah, sorry.
2060142 2061745 [chuckles] I feel like<br />I kinda killed the vibe.
2061769 2062936 I've never really,
2063020 2066356 I guess, said that<br />to anyone before. Sorry.
2066440 2068108 People wanna, like,<br />wrap up maybe or...
2068192 2069568 I'm going through a divorce.
2070944 2073739 Whoo! That shit felt<br />good to say.
2073822 2075240 Ooh, I'll tell y'all,
2075324 2077326 men... men need therapy.
2078243 2079995 [softly] Yeah.
2080078 2082873 [in normal voice] I think that's<br />a good place to maybe wrap up.
2093342 2094343 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
2095219 2096220 Um...
2097554 2099014 Thank you, um, for that.
2101433 2102434 Um...
2104144 2107105 I don't know<br />what you're doing tomorrow,
2107189 2111485 but I was going to study for Mr. G's<br />women murdered in history test,
2111568 2113821 if you wanna...
2117324 2118367 Yeah.
2119409 2120661 Yeah, okay, sure.
2122120 2124456 [man and woman<br />moaning in pleasure]
2124540 2125541 Mom?
2128544 2129670 [woman giggles]
2130838 2132339 [man groans]
2132422 2133632 Mom?
2137678 2139096 Oh, hi, honey.
2139179 2140722 What are you doing home<br />so early?
2143058 2145519 [grunts, groans]
2145602 2146603 Uh...
2147354 2148480 Are you kidding me?
2149481 2152150 I had a long day. [chuckles]
2153652 2155252 [Jeff] Mrs. Callahan,<br />can I have a snack?
2157781 2159301 [Stella-Rebecca]<br />First club fundraiser.
2159366 2161952 I'm so excited.<br />Great turnout, right?
2162035 2164371 Hello, ladies.
2164454 2165932 [Stella-Rebecca]<br />Hi, Bill, Bob, Fred...
2165956 2168059 I don't know why anyone<br />wants my old, dirty underwear.
2168083 2169626 It's so weird. [chuckles]
2169710 2172212 Hey, Britt, uh, don't let 'em<br />touch in between your toes.
2172296 2173463 Thanks, PJ.
2173547 2175173 - [Hazel groaning]<br />- Ah. We're havin' fun.
2175257 2176758 We're selling panties.
2176842 2179094 You know, Brittany said she'd<br />make me a custom bracelet.
2180804 2181805 Very nice.
2181889 2183181 [PJ] Do you wanna,<br />um, celebrate?
2183265 2185025 We could get some chicken<br />on a stick tonight.
2185976 2188979 Um, I can't. Uh...
2190230 2192733 Isabel and I have plans, so...
2192816 2194026 [Hazel continues groaning]
2194109 2195944 You're hanging out with Isabel?
2196028 2197195 Yep.
2197279 2199448 [PJ] Fuck, you're fast.<br />Oh, my God, okay.
2199531 2201283 I have to keep up.
2201366 2202618 Hazel, what is wrong?
2202701 2203994 Are you constipated<br />or something?
2204077 2205329 [Hazel] I'm fucking tired.
2205412 2207664 My mom was up all night<br />fucking the meathead.
2207748 2209625 What meathead?<br />Hi. Underwear, cars.
2209708 2211043 - Thanks.<br />- You know, like, the guy.
2211126 2212544 He's like the crybaby.
2214796 2215964 With the balls?
2216048 2218300 He catches them<br />and he... he throws them?
2220093 2222054 He's like the main guy.
2223221 2224222 [sputters] Jeff?
2225265 2226534 Is your mom hooking up<br />with Jeff?
2226558 2229061 I just thought Jeff might be<br />her safe word.
2229144 2230729 Jeff is his name, you idiot.
2230812 2232856 Just get the hot people<br />confused, Jesus.
2232940 2234358 [Stella-Rebecca yelps]
2234441 2235525 I'm good. [chuckles]
2235609 2237235 [PJ] Looking good, Stella!
2237319 2238528 [Isabel laughs]
2238612 2239732 [PJ] Are you gonna tell her?
2242699 2245035 [Tim] Yeah, they said<br />they were in juvie this summer.
2245118 2247371 Okay, are you sure<br />they're not in the system?
2249539 2251619 But isn't every kid from<br />Rockbridge Falls sent there?
2251667 2252668 [player] Hit me! Ow!
2254461 2256380 Okay, yeah, Essex County.<br />Any others?
2258590 2259675 Got it. Thank you.
2259758 2261385 - [players shouting]<br />- [sighs]
2265013 2266139 [whistle blows]
2267182 2268266 Jeff!
2268350 2271144 [easygoing music playing]
2272562 2274064 [Josie laughing]
2274147 2277609 No, yeah, but I thought<br />she was maybe dead.
2277693 2279319 - Not good.<br />- That's not the best.
2279403 2282406 - No. No, not great.<br />- That's not a great thing.
2282489 2283949 [Josie and Isabel laughing]
2288245 2289788 I wanted to...
2289871 2292457 I wanted to tell you<br />that, um, I'm...
2292541 2294334 I'm very glad<br />that I joined the club.
2295836 2296837 Me too.
2298755 2301216 I think it's really impressive
2301299 2304428 that you and PJ went through<br />everything that you did
2304511 2307889 and now have decided<br />to help the rest of us.
2307973 2310308 I mean even that story<br />you told the other day.
2311560 2313603 You're really, really brave.
2313687 2315022 No. [chuckles]
2315105 2316440 No. No, no.
2316523 2319776 Yes. I mean you almost<br />killed a girl. [chuckles]
2319860 2320861 You're...
2321987 2322988 Yeah, you're...
2324197 2325574 really, really brave.
2329077 2330078 What?
2335125 2336710 Actually, Isabel, uh...
2338045 2339713 - There's, um...<br />- Yeah?
2339796 2342257 There's something<br />you maybe should know.
2342340 2343508 Uh...
2345385 2347721 I mean it's pretty insane.
2347804 2349556 Okay. [chuckles]<br />What... what is it?
2351558 2352559 I just, I...
2355979 2357522 I heard Jeff is cheating on you.
2357606 2358926 - [music stops]<br />- [glasses clinking]
2361777 2363737 Wait... [laughing]
2366990 2368158 Wait, what? [chuckles]
2368241 2371453 I... I... Sorry, I think I...<br />I heard...
2371536 2376541 Um, what? Um...<br />Who... who told you that?
2376625 2381421 Hazel told me that, uh,<br />he and Mrs. Callahan
2381505 2385133 are at it, pretty much,<br />like, every night,
2385217 2388011 - like, constantly.<br />- [Josie and Isabel laughing]
2388095 2392140 I mean, just at it with each<br />other, which is pretty fucked up.
2392224 2395227 Um, even though I guess<br />it's, technically, it's legal,
2395310 2397229 it's still just<br />pretty nasty, uh...
2397312 2398855 [cries] Oh.
2398939 2400398 [sobbing]
2409783 2411201 Thanks.
2411284 2412953 [Jeff whistles]
2413036 2416164 [Jeff in sing-song voice] Jeff so hungy.<br />Hungy hungy, hungy.
2416248 2417791 Jeff so hungy.
2417874 2418959 [in normal voice] Swoosh!
2419876 2421920 [smacks lips, sniffs]
2422796 2424005 [grunts]
2424089 2425423 What the fuck is this?
2425507 2426587 Is there pineapple in this?
2427342 2428885 We talked about this, Janice.
2428969 2430209 Jeffrey's allergic to pineapple.
2433557 2434558 Eat a bag of dicks.
2438353 2439896 [sighs]
2439980 2442261 Well, I wasn't going to do it,<br />but this is the last straw.
2446653 2447696 How was last night?
2453493 2456913 Uh, bad, probably, I would say.
2456997 2458081 Wait, really?
2458165 2460125 [dramatic electronic<br />music playing]
2463086 2465046 She's walking really fast.
2465922 2467382 [Isabel breathing heavily]
2467465 2468884 She usually walks a lot slower.
2471511 2473722 Hi.
2473805 2475285 Are you having sex<br />with Mrs. Callahan?
2477726 2480437 Baby, you look so beautiful.
2480520 2482606 Like, so fucking hot.<br />How... how are you?
2482689 2484983 Bad. Are you having sex<br />with her?
2485066 2486610 [sputters] I'm... I'm...
2487944 2489654 helping her with her taxes.
2489738 2491156 Aren't you<br />in eighth grade algebra?
2491239 2493116 [chuckles] I can't answer<br />that question
2493200 2494552 because I... I don't know<br />how to read.
2494576 2495785 She's asking you to your face!
2495869 2497329 Fuck, that usually works.
2497412 2500165 [sighs] Are you cheating<br />on me again?
2500248 2503376 Baby, no! No!
2503460 2504753 No, why would...<br />why would I do...
2504836 2507380 That was one time<br />with your sister, just once,
2507464 2508673 two, four times.
2508757 2511593 No, I would never cheat<br />on you again, okay?
2511676 2514679 I promise you<br />I am not sleeping with her.
2514763 2516181 I literally saw you yesterday.
2516264 2517807 Shut up, nerd!<br />I fucked your mom!
2517891 2519851 - [Tim groans]<br />- [Isabel] Mmm. Mmm.
2520769 2521937 Wait.
2522020 2524731 - [chuckles] Yeah, we're done.<br />- Isabel...
2524814 2526775 [dramatic electronic<br />music playing]
2528443 2530153 I'm getting revenge.
2530237 2531964 I'm gonna fuck up some football players.<br />And I'm buyin' a gun.
2531988 2533740 Hell yeah.<br />I'll get my stepdad's.
2533823 2535200 What about, like, egging?
2535283 2536636 Yeah, so we can make 'em<br />not refrigerated and smelly?
2536660 2537845 Ooh, we could cook 'em<br />and be like...
2537869 2539120 - "You're cooked."<br />- Yes. Yeah.
2539204 2540324 Or what about, like, a bomb?
2542707 2545001 Like a...<br />like a super small bomb.
2545085 2546503 I mean, they're super easy<br />to make,
2546586 2548213 and I can just put it<br />under his car,
2548296 2549416 and it can be a distraction.
2551174 2553885 Yeah, Hazel, let's do terrorism.

2626249 2627917 [Sylvie] Nice! Nice!
2628001 2630462 I think I'mma help Isabel<br />keep watch, so...
2631629 2633256 Okay, well,<br />don't get distracted,
2633340 2636051 'cause we could be fined,<br />like, $2 for this, so...
2639596 2641014 Thought you might want<br />some company.
2643183 2644851 - Thank you.<br />- Yeah.
2647854 2649522 It's nice everybody's here,<br />like...
2650565 2651566 vandalizing...
2652442 2653443 Jeff's house.
2656321 2657530 It is nice.

2667415 2671461 But I did kind of miss<br />when he would touch my hair

2675256 2679052 "Shiny, shiny, shiny."<br />You know?
2679135 2682597 I wanted to tell you<br />this before, but...
2683932 2686101 I really appreciated<br />you fighting
2686184 2688853 and speaking loudly<br />at my boyfriend.

2753793 2754836 [PJ] Oh, my God.
2755545 2756546 What the fuck?
2757297 2759048 [Hazel] Holy shit.
2759132 2760300 [girls shouting]
2763428 2764929 [PJ] Oh, fuck, there's no door!
2767140 2768183 [girls shouting]
2772937 2774665 -[Sylvie] Annie, Annie, back up!<br />-[Annie] I'm going, I'm going!
2774689 2775708 Stop fucking yelling at me!
2775732 2776566 - I'm going!<br />- [Brittany] Fuck.
2776649 2777859 [tires screech]
2777942 2780862 <i>♪ A total eclipse<br />Of the heart ♪</i>
2782780 2784908 [Jeff screams] Oh, fuck!
2786034 2787553 Can you listen to me for,<br />like, once...
2787577 2789704 Ted! Ted-ay! Theodore!
2789787 2792081 - THEODORE: You're awesome!<br />- No, you're awesome.
2792165 2793642 Great. What are we supposed<br />to do now?
2793666 2795793 Relax. No one knows it's us.
2795877 2796878 [Tim] Hey, guys.
2797879 2799005 Great show last night.
2800215 2801799 I don't know what<br />you're talking about.
2801883 2803843 Oh, you don't.<br />No, it's really all good.
2803927 2806054 Jeffrey needed a new car,<br />anyway, so...
2807555 2808556 don't worry about it.
2809307 2810767 [foreboding music playing]
2812352 2813436 What's wrong, Josie?
2814938 2815939 You seem a little off.
2823488 2825907 Your club is over.
2826824 2827825 You understand?
2830870 2831913 Good.
2833331 2834600 [PJ] All right, well,<br />some of us clearly
2834624 2836167 have a different definition<br />of egging,
2836251 2839128 but if we keep our mouths<br />shut, stay calm, we'll be fine.
2839212 2840772 They're gonna shut us down,<br />aren't they?
2841214 2842340 What?
2842423 2844008 No. We don't know that.
2844092 2845736 -What... Why... -[Brittany]<br />Principal Meyers will believe
2845760 2847428 whatever Jeff and Tim say.
2847512 2849232 I don't really see how<br />we recover from this.
2850265 2851349 [Sylvie sighs] Man...
2852350 2853351 Fuck.
2853434 2855019 You know, it's been real, guys.
2855103 2857230 Okay, let's not jump<br />to conclusions
2857313 2859440 with the goodbyes and...
2859524 2861276 I'm gonna miss you guys so much.
2862986 2864880 [Sylvie] And like, at least<br />we went out with a bang.
2864904 2866614 I mean, that was fucking insane!
2866698 2867782 [girls laugh]
2867865 2869576 There was just, like,<br />fire everywhere.
2869659 2871578 [PJ] Wait. Stop.
2871661 2873871 We don't... Wait, no,<br />we don't know that for sure.
2873955 2877959 PJ, don't be sad it's over.<br />Be happy it happened.
2878042 2880670 [PJ] All right, can everyone<br />calm the fuck down, please?
2880753 2883339 The club is not over,<br />Josie, right?
2884757 2885758 [Isabel] No matter what,
2886759 2888428 this club has brought me<br />so much.
2888511 2889512 I feel...
2890847 2894684 so much more powerful and, um...
2895643 2896644 protected.
2897770 2898896 - Me too.<br />- [PJ chuckles]
2898980 2900398 - Great.<br />- [Hazel] Oh, my God, PJ.
2900481 2902233 Okay, I'm sorry<br />that you didn't get
2902317 2903377 what you wanted<br />out of this group,
2903401 2905278 but I think the rest of us did.
2905361 2906863 Oh. Good for fucking you,<br />Hazel.
2906946 2909198 I'm glad that you finally<br />wrote one email.
2909282 2910950 - Accomplished a lot.<br />- I actually did.
2911034 2913036 I practically ran this club<br />for you and Josie.
2913119 2914746 Hey, let's calm down, maybe.
2914829 2917141 You really think that you're the<br />reason that we have this club?
2917165 2918333 The reason? No.
2918416 2919560 But I can tell everyone that<br />if you want.
2919584 2921961 Hazel. Uh, hey,<br />let's calm down, right?
2922045 2923546 You're really ungrateful.
2923630 2925649 You're so lucky that we even<br />let you be a part of this.
2925673 2927383 PJ, you're a liar.
2930470 2931596 [PJ scoffs]
2931679 2934098 Yeah, well, you have no friends,
2934182 2936392 and a skank as a mom, so...
2950490 2951949 - [Josie] Hazel.<br />- [PJ scoffs]
2957705 2958706 [door closes]
2961793 2962794 [Brittany] PJ...
2964754 2966194 This doesn't mean<br />it wasn't worth it.
2971844 2973221 [mellow music playing]
2974514 2975640 [students chattering]
2975723 2976974 [crying]
2985692 2986776 Hazel.
2986859 2987860 [door closes]
2990405 2991531 Whoa.
2995535 2996536 I love God.
2997412 2998871 - Yes, same.<br />- [chuckles]
3008005 3009590 Yeah.
3009674 3011801 Oh, my God, I always<br />wanted one of these.
3013720 3017390 But my mom says they hide your<br />figure and make you look ugly.
3017473 3019517 Um, you can borrow it<br />if you want.
3019600 3021352 Like, as a joke or...
3022478 3023563 whatever.
3023646 3024731 Thanks.
3024814 3025815 [Josie] Yeah.
3032655 3034449 [Isabel] Wow, you and PJ
3034532 3036409 really have been<br />friends forever.
3036492 3039162 Oh, I mean,<br />since the first grade, so...
3040580 3043040 We had the same<br />babysitter, Rhodes.
3043124 3045877 PJ called her Gay Yoda, but I<br />think she's kind of like a mentor.
3048254 3049714 [Josie clears throat]
3049797 3052842 Yeah, but you guys, like,<br />could not be more different.
3053593 3054844 She's so, like...
3056262 3057263 like...
3058014 3059515 [chuckles] You know?
3059599 3060839 - [chuckles] Yeah.<br />- And you're...
3061559 3062560 You're so, like...
3064771 3066063 [both chuckle]
3069609 3071444 - You know what I mean?<br />- No, yeah, I know.
3075531 3076532 Josie...
3077116 3078284 [gentle music playing]
3110733 3111734 [grunts softly]
3120034 3121577 [Isabel breathing heavily]
3124747 3127124 [PJ] I'm tryna help<br />your jewelry business grow.
3127208 3128793 - [Brittany] Really?<br />- [PJ] Yeah.
3128876 3131276 I don't know if I can hire you<br />because you're like a convict.
3134173 3135508 Wow.
3135591 3139345 This is, um, a total shithole.
3139428 3140508 [Brittany chuckles lightly]
3145059 3146185 Kind of a mess. Sorry.
3150189 3152817 Well, I hear that<br />if you hire a convict,
3152900 3154151 they give you a tax break.
3156571 3158030 [Brittany groans]
3158114 3160199 I fucking hate Mr. G.
3160283 3162493 Everything he says<br />is so pathetic.
3162577 3164704 Oh, yeah. I mean,
3164787 3167206 I feel like he, like,<br />jerks off to a poster
3167290 3170293 of the 1999 Rockbridge team<br />every single night, so...
3170376 3172295 Literally the peak<br />of his existence.
3179385 3180386 [Brittany sighs]
3183431 3185683 Like, what is the point<br />of this assignment?
3186976 3191272 Who is bell hooks<br />and why do we care?
3191355 3193733 Oh, sorry, I'm just trying to,<br />like, study over here.
3194859 3195985 [whispering] Watch out.
3206370 3207371 What?
3208414 3210416 Uh, nothing, I'm just...
3212001 3214754 I'm just concerned<br />'cause I'm, like...
3214837 3219383 Your wrists are so small, and the<br />pen is so heavy that I'm like,
3219467 3221802 - "Is she getting exhausted?"<br />- Mmm.
3221886 3223766 I'm surprised you can even see<br />what you're doing
3223804 3225014 with all the surface area
3225097 3226457 - that yours are taking up.<br />- [gasps]
3227224 3228351 Wow.
3228434 3229786 Must be a struggle<br />for you to write.
3229810 3231312 Okay, does this hurt?
3231395 3233332 Actually, yeah, that does hurt<br />my tiny, delicate wrists.
3233356 3235076 Yeah, that was<br />the lightest tap of all time.
3235107 3236543 - Can you feel that?<br />- Can't even feel that.
3236567 3238527 - Can't feel anything.<br />- Just like muscles in there.
3247328 3248329 Um...
3248913 3249914 Uh...
3252083 3254377 PJ, I'm... I'm straight.
3259799 3260800 Oh.
3263511 3264595 Um...
3267306 3270142 Yeah. Um...
3270226 3273270 -I'm... I'm sorry if you misread anything.<br />-No, that's all...
3273354 3276190 It's all good. I shouldn't<br />have assumed anything.
3281320 3282321 [drums playing]
3293290 3294917 [sighs] Um...
3296210 3297503 I wanted to tell you something.
3298421 3300256 What?
3300339 3302925 Like, something that happened<br />last night.
3304593 3305720 What happened?
3307346 3308431 [softly] With Isabel.
3312768 3313769 Wait.
3317231 3318232 Wait, seriously?
3319066 3320151 [spectators cheering]
3323029 3324655 That's... that's amazing.<br />That's...
3325614 3326991 [all cheering]
3327074 3328576 [Jeff] <i>Everybody,</i>
3328659 3331328 <i>- even the fucking losers...</i><br />- Even the fucking losers!
3331412 3334165 <i>make some noise!</i>
3334248 3336125 [spectators cheering]
3339170 3340713 I thought you were<br />super Christian.
3340796 3343841 I know. I just like getting<br />caught up in the festivities.
3343924 3345694 <i>All right, uh, so we're gonna<br />do the pep rally.</i>
3345718 3347219 <i>First up, cheerleaders.</i>
3347303 3348554 [cheerleaders cheering]

3376207 3377208 Oh.
3377750 3379710 <i>How many of you</i>
3379794 3383714 <i>know about that little girl<br />fight club that could?</i>
3383798 3385549 [scattered clapping]
3385633 3387093 Ay, there go my girls.
3387176 3391347 <i>Well, do we have<br />a surprise for you.</i>
3391430 3394683 <i>We're gonna bring...<br />Where is she?</i>
3394767 3396936 [snaps fingers] <i>Hazel down.</i>
3398104 3400481 <i>One of the founding members.</i>
3400564 3402817 <i>To show us everything<br />the club's taught her</i>
3402900 3405319 <i>in a fun little challenge.</i>
3405402 3406862 [girls cheering]
3406946 3409657 - [girl 1] Let's go, Hazel!<br />- [girl 2] Go, Hazel!
3409740 3412451 - What is this?<br />- I... I don't know.
3413786 3414954 [exhales]
3415037 3417998 [Tim] <i>Hazel will be</i><br /><i>fighting Tucker,</i>
3418916 3420751 <i>the school's number one boxer.</i>
3421585 3422586 [Tucker screams]
3423129 3424922 [growling]
3425005 3426006 [neck cracks]
3427883 3430094 Wait, I thought I was gonna be<br />fighting PJ?
3430177 3433097 <i>I know what you're thinking,<br />but don't be alarmed.</i>
3433180 3434890 <i>Girls can do anything<br />guys can do, right?</i>
3434974 3436225 Yeah, kick his ass!
3437893 3438894 <i>Ready?</i>
3439562 3440855 - Fuck.<br /><i>- Go.</i>

3450614 3452408 [yells]
3452491 3453492 [spectators clamoring]
3456120 3457520 - [Hazel shouts]<br />- [Annie] Oh, my God.
3459456 3461083 [coughing]
3461167 3462477 - You got this, Hazel.<br />- [girl 3] Come on, Hazel!
3462501 3464461 - You got it.<br />- [grunts]

3476432 3477433 [Tucker grunting]
3478934 3479977 Shit.
3481979 3483522 Whoo! Get him!
3484315 3485816 [grunting]
3487026 3488027 [Tucker exclaims, laughs]
3490279 3491363 [Hazel screams]
3497119 3498638 -[girl 4] The fuck are you doing?<br />-Is she, like,
3498662 3499830 sort of winning or...
3499914 3502833 [both screaming]
3502917 3504668 No, leave the skin<br />on his face, will you?
3505836 3507838 - [grunts]<br />- Fuck.
3507922 3509423 [PJ] Oh. Oh, my God.
3509506 3511133 <i>I know what you're thinking.</i>
3511217 3515554 <i>You may be wondering how a<br />girl under the training of...</i>
3516555 3519808 <i>of two juvie convicted killers</i>
3519892 3523354 <i>can't even stand up for herself<br />against a regular old guy.</i>
3523437 3525147 [Tucker yells]
3525231 3527608 [Tim] <i>Well, truth is, they...</i>
3530611 3531904 <i>they didn't go to juvie.</i>
3531987 3532988 [Jeff gasps]
3533072 3534073 <i>No.</i>
3534156 3535157 [Isabel laughs]
3536533 3538013 [Tim] <i>There's no record</i><br /><i>of them there.</i>
3539536 3540663 <i>And according to Hazel...</i>
3540746 3541747 [coughs]
3543040 3544541 <i>they never fought<br />anyone at all.</i>
3544625 3546543 <i>And you know what else?</i>
3546627 3550130 <i>They didn't start the club<br />to empower women.</i>
3551674 3554218 <i>They did it<br />to fuck cheerleaders.</i>
3554301 3555302 [Tim scoffs]
3557721 3559223 <i>What is wrong with you?</i>
3561809 3563435 <i>It is such a shame.</i>
3565646 3567940 <i>We were really rooting<br />for you girls.</i>
3568023 3569817 - [footsteps stomping]<br />- [Tucker yells]
3569900 3571485 - Oh, my God.<br />- Oh, my God.
3571568 3573153 [Tim] <i>Okay.</i>
3573237 3575406 <i>- Thank you for attending...</i><br />- [Stella-Rebecca] Hazel!
3575489 3577050 <i>- today's pep rally. Go Vikings! Fuck<br />Huntington! </i>-[Stella-Rebecca] Is she okay?
3577074 3578450 - Hazel!<br />- [Tim] <i>Whoo!</i>
3578534 3580119 - [Jeff] Yes!<br />- [Tim chuckles] <i>Yes!</i>
3581912 3583539 [foreboding music playing]
3588627 3589712 Is that true?
3590587 3592256 That's why you started this?
3592339 3594925 No, no, no.<br />[breathing heavily]
3595009 3596635 Not... not entirely.
3596719 3598345 Not entire... Okay.
3598429 3601348 Listen guys.<br />It doesn't matter...
3601432 3603934 the reason that we started<br />this, right? Like...
3604852 3606312 The point of the club
3606395 3610232 is that we all learn<br />from each other, right?
3610316 3613360 And... and we had a great time<br />doing it and...
3613444 3614796 I thought this club<br />was for sisterhood,
3614820 3617197 but it was for your own<br />selfish interests?
3617281 3618907 This is the second wave<br />all over again.
3624913 3626332 Isabel, please, please, wait.
3626415 3628792 PJ made me do this.<br />I didn't want to.
3628876 3630076 I would never want to do this.
3633589 3635149 [voice breaking]<br />You're pathetic, Josie.
3646894 3648334 [PJ] Mr. G,<br />we're really sorry, we...
3648395 3649563 All right, look.
3649646 3651940 You know what?<br />I'm not a fuckin' idiot.
3652024 3653233 I just look like this.
3653317 3655486 I wasn't doin' this shit<br />as a distraction.
3655569 3658405 I actually was doin' this shit<br />'cause I actually liked y'all group
3658489 3659656 and what y'all stood for.
3659740 3662326 - Wait, we can explain.<br />- I trusted you two
3662409 3664661 and y'all exploited<br />my solidarity.
3664745 3667498 I played the role<br />of an amazin' ally.
3667581 3668874 Is this about the time I said
3668957 3670959 Amelia Earhart was a fake hero?
3671710 3673420 Because it's true.
3673504 3676673 Many a guy fly planes<br />without crashing,
3676757 3677957 but you never hear about them.
3678550 3680094 And then it's like,
3680177 3682471 [in high-pitched voice] "Oh,<br />it's so hard to be a girl."
3682554 3684139 "We, like, make less money."
3684223 3686183 "We had to lose<br />our last names."
3686266 3687643 "I love you."
3687726 3689662 "I want to be with you<br />for the rest of our lives."
3689686 3693232 "Oh, I love the mint green<br />backsplash in the kitchen."
3693315 3694584 [in normal voice]<br />And all of a sudden,
3694608 3696402 you leave me<br />for a motherfucker named Tony
3696485 3699279 and suddenly, the fucking<br />kitchen is lime green.
3699363 3700739 I think...
3700823 3703242 Yeah, I think that moved<br />away from us.
3703325 3705744 Oh, you look confused, like<br />how I'm confused right now,
3705828 3708497 on how you created a fucking<br />fight club to get some cooch.
3708580 3711750 And for what? Y'all ain't even<br />know how to work that thing.
3711834 3713710 And I know y'all ain't<br />tickling the pearl,
3713794 3715021 you know what I'm talking about?
3715045 3716272 You know what I mean?<br />Caressing the back
3716296 3718173 of that neck and all type of...
3718257 3721137 Sorry, I just don't know if you're<br />supposed to be talking to us like that.
3721218 3722719 Just, like, as a teacher...
3722803 3724388 Man, I knew women were evil.
3724471 3727433 Motherfuckers always tellin'<br />me like, "No, that's not true."
3728475 3730477 But time and time again...<br />[scoffs]
3732020 3733021 [exhales]
3733730 3735607 [PJ sighs]
3735691 3738068 -[door opens] -Women ain't<br />nothing but the fuckin' devil.
3738152 3741363 [door shuts]<br />I can't fuckin' believe Hazel.
3741447 3744575 Okay, well, you were pretty<br />horrible to her yesterday.
3746034 3750497 I'm sorry, what?<br />This is... this is my fault?
3750581 3753834 I'm not the one who put Isabel<br />on a rampage.
3753917 3756128 Sorry, what does that have<br />to do with anything?
3756211 3758672 If Isabel wasn't so desperate<br />to get revenge,
3758755 3760382 then we wouldn't have<br />blown up Jeff's car
3760466 3762176 and then he wouldn't be so upset
3762259 3764571 and then whatever the fuck just<br />happened would not have happened.
3764595 3767556 Okay, so all of the blame<br />just goes on me then?
3767639 3770142 Like, none of this can<br />be traced back to you at all?
3770225 3773145 Well, I mean, yeah, it was your<br />idea to start the whole club.
3774521 3776899 I didn't want to do this<br />from the beginning.
3776982 3778984 You know that.
3779067 3782070 I just followed your lead<br />like an idiot.
3782154 3784907 You followed my lead when<br />you created that insane story
3784990 3788660 about girls betting on you to<br />fight other girls with shivs.
3788744 3791538 You're just mad<br />because I did this.
3791622 3794625 I... I... I got to be<br />with Isabel on my own.
3794708 3796084 Without you.
3796168 3797896 No, you never would<br />have talked to her without me,
3797920 3799379 - ever.<br />- [chuckles]
3799463 3801048 I'm the one who made it<br />happen for you.
3801131 3806053 You know what's so funny about<br />this whole fucking thing,
3806136 3807387 all your little schemes,
3807471 3810432 all your,<br />"Oh, we'll have our year
3810516 3813727 and we'll fuck so many<br />girls," and whatever?
3813810 3818190 Is that you're the only one<br />who didn't do anything.
3818273 3820567 Yeah, well, that's 'cause<br />Brittany's straight, so...
3820651 3822236 Yeah, no, shit, she's straight.
3822319 3823779 Does it even matter?
3823862 3826990 Do you even care?<br />Do you actually like her?
3827074 3829451 Do you care about anyone<br />other than yourself?
3829535 3830869 Just find some other girl
3830953 3833121 to fucking jack off to<br />and do nothing about.
3839169 3840379 Cool. Yeah, I will.

4005502 4007629 Why... why... why you look<br />like a scared puppy?
4009715 4011258 [Josie] Hey, Rhodes.
4011341 4012718 Do you have a minute to talk?
4013844 4015470 If you don't wanna<br />borrow firearms,
4015554 4017264 - then why are you here?<br />- Um...
4018140 4019474 - Like, for advice?<br />- [sighs]
4019558 4021476 I'm not your Gay Yoda, Josie.
4021560 4022728 You're too old for this shit.
4022811 4023979 [sighs]
4024062 4026189 Girl, when I was in high school,
4026273 4028859 people found out I was gay,<br />nobody wanted to be my friend.
4028942 4030152 And back then it was worse
4030235 4033029 because they hated you<br />just for being gay.
4033113 4035157 [both] Not for being<br />gay and untalented.
4035240 4037033 Mmm.
4037117 4038910 Sorry, people didn't know<br />you were gay?
4038994 4040954 Girl, I wore a weave<br />back then, okay?
4041663 4042873 And I used to say,
4042956 4044308 [in high-pitched voice]<br />"Hey, girl. Hey..."
4044332 4045727 [in normal voice]<br />Look, that's not the point.
4045751 4046752 You want some advice?
4046835 4048628 Invest in yourself,
4048712 4050472 teach people to fear you<br />instead of love you.
4050505 4053592 I don't wanna, like, deny<br />your advice, obviously.
4053675 4054926 I just, um...
4055010 4057262 PJ and I are actually<br />in a fight right now.
4057345 4058680 - So, like...<br />- [coughing]
4058764 4060432 Like, that's the advice<br />that I need.
4060515 4063643 I never had many friends,<br />and that's... that's sad.
4063727 4066062 And as I've gotten old<br />in this world,
4066146 4067814 it's just gotten more sad.
4069816 4071693 Okay, um...
4071777 4073570 I think I'm just gonna go<br />to the game
4073653 4075572 and then work it out<br />with PJ there.
4075655 4076740 I wouldn't do that.
4076823 4077908 Why not?
4077991 4079951 - It's with Huntington, right?<br />- Yeah.
4080035 4083079 Well, I'm guessing they've been fucking<br />people up for the past month, right?
4083163 4085665 - Yeah.<br />- So, they're violent.
4085749 4087185 What do you think's<br />gonna happen tonight?
4087209 4089044 I don't know. Football?
4090086 4092172 - Game? Tackle?<br />- [groans]
4092255 4093340 Oh, girl.
4094716 4096968 There is a 50-year rivalry<br />going on.
4097052 4099012 They always fuck up<br />some unlucky player.
4100472 4101932 How you don't know...
4102015 4104768 In '77, they burned him<br />at a stake with his dog.
4104851 4107938 In '92, they drowned him<br />in a giant kiddie pool.
4108021 4111066 And in '03, they pulled<br />his body apart with horses.
4111149 4112442 It's called quartering.
4112526 4113985 I know... I know<br />what it's called.
4114069 4116112 So, tonight, I'm stayin' inside
4116196 4117656 and double boltin' those doors.

4162284 4164077 Why are you breathing so heavy?
4164160 4166663 Okay. I know we're not<br />in a great place right now...
4166746 4169040 Yeah, because I'm pissed.<br />I'm fuckin' pissed.
4169124 4171418 Okay, well, I just still think<br />we need to talk

4173420 4175547 Yeah, cool, well,<br />I don't wanna hear it, so...
4175630 4177632 Okay, maybe you<br />should reconsider

4180302 4182596 She said this Huntington shit's<br />way darker than we thought.
4182679 4185390 Apparently, every time<br />Huntington plays Rockbridge,
4185473 4187601 they try to kill a player<br />and his pets.
4187684 4188894 The pets?
4188977 4190896 It's bloodlust, man.<br />That's not the point.
4190979 4192147 Sounds like I should get
4192230 4193291 -the fuck out of here now.<br />Okay? -No.
4193315 4194691 PJ, seriously, come on.
4194774 4196210 We need to get<br />the club back together,
4196234 4198820 so we can save them.<br />[inhales, coughs]
4198904 4199946 What?
4201740 4204451 Sorry, you're saying<br />you want me and then you
4204534 4206995 and then all of the girls<br />that fuckin' hate us

4213418 4215021 Okay, well, obviously, why<br />would you lay it out like that?
4215045 4216129 Because it sounds insane.
4216212 4218006 'Cause it is.<br />Why would we do that?
4218089 4221176 Because we made these girls trust<br />us and then we humiliated them.
4222677 4225764 They deserve a shot<br />at showing everybody
4225847 4227390 what they know,<br />what they learned,
4227474 4228892 how fucking cool they are.
4230060 4231728 Let's do this for the club.

4270976 4275271 Okay, first off, PJ has<br />something to say to Hazel, so...
4275355 4278108 The apology. Do the apology.<br />Do the apology, instead.
4278191 4279734 Okay.
4279818 4282278 I'm sorry that I called<br />your mom a skank.
4284489 4287117 And I'm sorry
4287200 4290996 for saying that you have<br />no friends really loud
4291079 4292914 in front of all of your friends.
4292998 4296543 And I'm sorry for being an<br />asshole a lot of the time.
4297919 4300505 Most of the... All of the time.
4300588 4304009 And I do think that it's nice<br />you always take notes
4304092 4308388 and then you type them up<br />and email them to everyone...
4311266 4312767 and I really appreciate it.
4316354 4317355 Do you forgive me?
4319733 4321484 Yes.
4321568 4323129 [Josie] I don't want to<br />interrupt this gorgeous moment
4323153 4324863 but we don't have time now

4329242 4330535 someone on this team tonight.
4330618 4331679 What are you even<br />talking about, Josie?
4331703 4332996 Nobody's even over there.
4333079 4334914 [Josie] Oh, my God,<br />nobody is even over there.
4334998 4336666 Well, that is obviously<br />a red flag.
4336750 4339085 Are we not reading that<br />as a red flag? That's crazy.
4339169 4341212 - What?<br />- [Josie] Please, Annie.
4341296 4342776 Even though<br />you're a Black Republican,

4345175 4347153 I mean, obviously I know that.<br />You think I don't know that?
4347177 4349095 [Josie] Then help us<br />figure this out.
4349179 4351765 We need to stop the game.<br />We need to save them.
