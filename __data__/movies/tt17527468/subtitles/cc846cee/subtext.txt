28650 30180 <i>Tonight is<br />the fucking night, okay?</i>
30380 33810 We've looked like shit for<br />years, and we are developing.
34000 35770 I would say I'm actually<br />mostly developed.
35960 38980 We're finally hot.<br />At least, according to me.
39180 40440 We're getting out there.
40640 42040 We're getting in the cooch,<br />my girl.
42180 44690 We are getting in the puss<br />and we're gettin' wet.
44890 46360 Man, speak for yourself.
46560 48490 Nobody's gonna wanna<br />fuck me this year,
48690 51126 just like nobody wanted to fuck<br />me last year or the year before.
51150 53410 Okay, well, I'm gonna talk<br />to Brittany.
53610 54610 I think that it's time.
54690 55700 Oh, really? It's time?
55900 57950 There wasn't time<br />in the last 11 years
58150 59676 we've all been going<br />to school together?
59700 60790 I've been building tension.
60990 62346 You know,<br />you could say hi to Isabel.
62370 63370 Yeah, okay.
63490 64790 And just what would I say?
64990 68260 Like, "Hey, girl, what's up?<br />How's your boyfriend?
68460 70090 How's his penis?
70290 73090 Still awesome and big and<br />throbbing and, uh, like a male penis?"
73290 74930 They could have broken up,<br />you never know.
75000 76640 The fair is like<br />a completely fresh start.
76800 79270 I'm not doin' that with<br />Isabel, you know what I mean?
79470 82520 Like, I'm... I'm... I'm playin'<br />the long game with her, okay?
82720 84520 - Mmm.<br />- Here's how it's gonna shake out.
84720 86820 I don't speak to the bitch<br />for years.
87020 90030 Bam! It's the 20th<br />high school reunion.
90230 91490 I show up, I'm in a little suit
91690 93570 like the lesbian I am,<br />you know what I mean?
93770 94810 It's probably white, okay?
94980 97290 She looks at me,<br />I look back at her.
97480 99370 What the fuck happened to her?
99570 101910 She's washed up.
102110 103880 I mean Jeff has run her ragged.
104070 107000 That's when my ass<br />swoops in, okay?
107200 110590 That made me so sad.<br />What? Okay.
110790 112090 Josie, tick-tock.
112290 114356 We're not gonna be sexy<br />little high schoolers forever.
114380 116140 Soon we're gonna be old hags<br />in college.
116340 118500 Do you wanna be the only<br />girl virgin at Sarah Lawrence?
118590 119590 Yeah, honestly, maybe.
119670 121060 I might have a good shot<br />that way.
121260 124500 I don't need this negative,<br />really sad attitude. Please.
125620 127250 What the fuck are you wearing?
129420 131530 It's really not too late<br />to turn around, you know?
131730 133320 I think you wanna be here.
133520 134740 Who said that?
134940 136416 - Where'd you get that idea?<br />- I'm just feeling...
136440 139410 You're getting nervous because<br />of how excited you are.
139610 141910 - No. No, no.<br />- Yeah, yeah.
142110 143966 Oh, and we're crossing.<br />And we're getting in there.
143990 146080 No, I can't, I'm sorry.<br />Ahhh! Fuck, my arm!
146280 147556 There's nothing wrong<br />with your arm.
147580 148960 You have Munchausen's.
149160 150670 Look, just follow my lead.
150870 152050 - Hello, ladies.<br />- Oh.
152250 153380 Oh.<br />You know what?
153580 154806 - Just keep going.<br />- How was your summer?
154830 156430 - Good to see you.<br />- Okay, you know what?
156630 157910 Uh, it's not gonna happen, okay?
158090 159890 This school has such<br />a gay problem.
160090 162480 Okay, no.<br />No one hates us for being gay.
162670 166060 Everyone hates us for being<br />gay, untalented, and ugly.
166260 167980 Like, look at Matthieu.
168180 169770 Rock on, man. Killin' it.
169970 172070 I love what you're doing<br />with the school play.
172270 173880 Thanks, bitch.
174960 177070 - Fuck!<br />- Yeah.
177270 178746 Knocks it out of the park,<br />every year.
178770 180540 - Every show.<br />- Yeah.
180730 182870 Ooh. Popcorn.
183070 184070 Don't mind if I do.
195690 197930 - Hey, guys.<br />- Hi, Hazel.
198130 200260 Oh, hey, Hazel.<br />How was your summer?
200460 202470 Were you with your uncle<br />at the slop farm?
202670 204951 If you mean volunteering at<br />the National Meat Association,
205990 207310 yeah, it was good.
207510 208730 What are you guys doing here?
208930 209986 You guys never come to the fair.
210010 211110 What happened to your arm?
211310 213480 Oh, my God,<br />she ate shit is what happened.
213680 215080 She ate literal shit?<br />What the fuck?
215140 217110 - Mmm.<br />- Or did you get beat up again?
217310 218820 No, I just tripped and I...
219020 220830 Or were you jumped?<br />Was it spy camp?
221020 222370 Did you go to juvie?
222570 224166 <i>- Yeah, we went to juvie.<br />- Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
224190 225716 <i>- Oh, my God, it was juvie?<br />- ...It's time to get ready,</i>
225740 229210 <i>get wild, and get horny<br />for our very own Vikings!</i>
229410 231040 Oh, my God, what did you do?
231240 233630 <i>And the man<br />who will lead us to victory</i>
233830 235720 <i>against the evil, maniacal,</i>
235910 238090 <i>shit-eating Huntington Ferrets,</i>
238290 240510 <i>let's hear it for Jeff!</i>
240710 242180 Jeff! Have my babies!
242380 243890 Jeff, fill me with your seed!
245550 247066 I just don't get why girls<br />like guys like that.
247090 249690 It's like they're like dogs,<br />or pigs, or is there a...
249890 251210 What's the grossest animal?
252620 254230 Jeff, come sign my tits!
254430 256460 Eat my pussy!
258340 259340 That's right.
261050 263410 Oh, fuck. Uh, Hazel.
263610 265620 Gimme that.<br />Josie, take this. Take this.
265820 267120 - Take this.<br />- No.
267320 268620 Really quick.<br />This is the moment.
268820 270500 Stop yelling at me!
270700 272260 Could you give that back<br />really quickly?
272640 273920 Hey, Brittany.
274120 276630 I am loving all the...
276830 278380 holes in your pants.
278580 279580 Thanks.
279710 281510 You look like<br />a little Dutch boy.
281710 282710 Thank you.
282840 284970 So, Britt...<br />Can I call you Britt?
285170 287020 I prefer if you just<br />called me my name.
287220 289520 - Britt-a-nay. Um, but...<br />- No, not that.
289720 291150 Brittany.
291340 292826 Are you thinking of riding<br />the Ferris wheel at all tonight?
292850 295150 I wasn't. I'm going<br />on the puke and duke.
295350 296350 I need to pull trig.
296430 297740 - No, you don't.<br />- Yeah, I do.
297930 299116 I'm gonna say something crazy.
299140 302570 I think you could eat food,
302770 305160 digest it, let it marinate,<br />poop it out.
305360 306490 Mmm, gross.
306690 308160 Maybe this?<br />You want a bite of this?
308360 310460 - Oh, no.<br />- Yeah, this is fucking disgusting. Ugh.
310660 312420 You want a hot dog?<br />We could go get hot dogs.
312530 313630 Oh, I don't know.
313830 315176 Yeah, we could get the bun<br />and the ketchup.
315200 317130 - No bun. No.<br />- You gotta get the bun.
317330 318970 - Yes, you could.<br />- No.
319160 321010 No bun. Okay.
321210 323300 Um, Isabel.
323500 325600 Josie was just saying<br />something similar to me.
325800 326800 I don't think so.
326960 328430 I think so.<br />It was really good.
328630 329950 It was super funny.
333640 337460 You're just so...<br />You're skinny too, as well.
339130 340900 I'm Josie, by the way,<br />good evening.
341100 342660 Yeah, you're skinny...
342850 344286 You're real skinny minnie,<br />aren't ya?
344310 346120 You probably should eat.
346320 348716 They're gonna send you to the<br />hospital with how skinny you are.
348740 351100 Uh-oh, call the doctor.<br />Skinny girl, I see.
353430 354966 Okay, do you guys want<br />any of our tickets?
354990 356020 Yeah, yeah. Thank you.
357520 360720 Fuck! Fuck!
360910 362720 I don't want to say it,<br />but we're fucked.
362920 364260 You know what? I'm good.
364460 366260 'Cause it's not gonna happen<br />for me.
366460 367720 If it's not happening here,
367920 370470 then it's definitely not<br />happening at Emerson, okay?
370670 372690 I'm done trying to sow<br />my damn oats.
372880 374770 - No.<br />- I'm packing up my vagina
374970 376360 and I'm fucking Matthieu.
376560 377820 That's the only hope for me.
378010 379360 - No.<br />- It's me and Matthieu, man.
379560 380840 And 'cause he's gay<br />and fearless,
380980 382746 he's probably gonna fuck me<br />without protection.
382770 383890 Then I'm gonna get pregnant.
383980 385036 We're going to have<br />to join a church.
385060 386160 He'll be the gay pastor.
386360 387740 My whole life's fucked!
387940 389580 And yeah, sure,<br />his sermons are good,
389780 391330 but everybody knows he's fruity.
391530 393750 Everybody knows<br />he's fucking fruity!
393950 396460 By the way, our son, Hezekiah,<br />hates us
396660 398130 'cause he knows<br />we're both closeted,
398330 400476 but we try to make it work<br />for him, but he's not happy.
400500 401710 And yeah, guess what?
401910 404550 The deacon's fucking<br />the evangelist, man!
404750 406930 He's fucking the evangelist!
407130 409850 I don't wanna live like that.
410050 412680 Will you come and visit us<br />on Sundays?
412880 416560 Please, will you come<br />and visit us on Sundays?
416760 419480 - Isabel.<br />- Leave me alone!
419680 421036 - Stop following me.<br />- Wait, shut up.
421060 422110 - What?<br />- Look.
422310 423990 - Don't touch me.<br />- Isabel, baby.
424190 425400 My teeny, tiny baby girl.
425600 427570 Why do you always have<br />to flirt with other women?
427770 429830 It doesn't count<br />if they're not in high school.
430030 431160 Especially Mrs. Reilly!
431360 433160 - Josie, offer her a ride.<br />- I don't think so.
433360 434360 Yes, come on.
434450 435790 ...Irish Catholic.
435990 437210 And I'm regular Christian!
437410 438960 - Josie, ask her. Come on.<br />- PJ, stop.
439160 440840 You're hurting my head.
441040 443300 You're attacking me,<br />and it's giving me a migraine.
443500 445846 And it's giving me PTSD about all<br />the other times I've had migraines.
445870 447590 - Just do it now.<br />- No.
447790 450376 - Just go fucking ask her.<br />- No. Isabel, would you like a safety ride?
450400 451410 Isabel.
452870 454180 - Oh, no.<br />- Oh, my God.
454380 455600 Isabel...
455800 457100 Get out of the car.
457300 458460 You can't tell me what to do.
458640 460310 - Yeah, no, he can't.<br />- Okay,
460510 463360 I'm sorry that I looked<br />at Mrs. Reilly
463560 465490 and lightly grazed<br />her left tit, all right?
465690 467740 Move, you prick!
467940 469780 Uh, excuse me,<br />she said, "Move, prick."
469980 471126 Don't talk to me,<br />you ugly bitch, okay?
471150 473700 I do not talk to girls<br />in overalls.
473900 476126 - Hey.<br />- Okay, I might be ugly, but these aren't overalls.
476150 478460 Isabel, get out<br />of the freaking car! Get out!
478660 480130 Get out! Come on.
480330 481466 - I feel like we should just drive.<br />- Drive.
481490 482590 - Drive.<br />- Let's just go.
482790 484346 Please. You're being<br />really mean right now.
484370 485610 - He'll move.<br />- He's not moving.
485710 486710 He's gonna move.
486830 488110 - We're about to drive.<br />- Isabel.
488250 490050 - Drive. He'll move.<br />- Just drive. Josie, go.
490250 492510 - Three, two one...<br />- Pedal to the metal. Drive!
501750 503360 - Oh, my God!<br />- Oh, my God!
503560 504630 Jeff?
505920 507280 Jeff!
507480 508570 - Are you...<br />- Are you okay?
508770 509916 When people move cars,<br />don't people move?
509940 511530 Jeffrey, I'm coming!<br />I'm coming!
511730 513120 You're not alone.<br />You're not alone.
513320 515660 - Back up! Back up!<br />- We didn't even do anything.
515860 519000 No, come here.
519200 520280 - Man down! Man down!<br />- You!
520450 521580 Oh, my God.
521780 523466 - I'm... I'm blacking out.<br />- No, stay with me.
523490 524590 We should go. Let's go.
524790 526050 - Let's go.<br />- Yeah. Okay.
526250 527630 Let's just kind of peel on out.
527830 529130 - Fine.<br />- What did you do to him?
529330 531050 Buckle it for me. Fuck!
531250 533390 You fucking cowards!
533590 534610 You better fucking run!
535740 538430 - I don't understand.<br />- What the fuck?
538630 541690 They're not gonna<br />get away with this!
545330 546360 <i>{\an8}Attention.</i>
546560 548280 <i>The library is out of use again.</i>
548480 550400 <i>Huntington shot up<br />our remaining books,</i>

554360 557080 Oh, Brittany was just so cute<br />last night.
557280 561250 Like, "No, I can't eat<br />a hot dog.
561450 564080 I know I won't even digest it.
564280 565280 I have to throw up."
565450 567300 And I was, like,<br />"You can have it."
567500 569420 She's like, "No, not, just...
569620 571020 Maybe, but not the bun."
572190 574030 Oh, it was just really sweet.
574950 575950 You had to be there.
576090 577090 I was there.
578200 579230 Are you serious?
579420 580940 I got "faggot number two"<br />this time?
581130 582600 You're the sidekick, not me.
582800 584650 'Sup, Ted? How's the family?
584850 586670 Sick. Yeah, you know<br />what to do.
587620 589280 Thanks.
589480 591956 Do you feel like people are<br />looking at us? Like, more than usual?
591980 593460 I don't know.<br />Did you period yourself?
593650 595720 Mmm... Mmm-mmm. Hey, Sylvie.
597090 598370 Hi.
600700 602160 Holy shit. Are you guys okay?
602360 603710 What? Yeah.
603910 605466 - Why wouldn't we be okay?<br />- All right, kiddos.
605490 607250 Welcome back to class.
607450 609130 Hey! The prep club worked hard<br />on those.
609330 610420 That belongs to the school.
610620 612300 Oh, cool.<br />So, does your vagina.
612500 613550 Nice try, PJ,
613750 615470 but my vagina belongs<br />to the government.
615670 617470 All right, check it out.
617670 620256 - Today I got a special lesson for all of you.<br />- Josie, so, how'd you do it?
620280 621280 Do what?
624540 626060 Holy shit. Is he okay?
626260 627460 Hey, you good, man?
629670 630780 What the fuck?
630980 633070 - Yeah, okay, so...<br />- What the fuck?
633270 634326 Meanwhile, back at the ranch...
634350 635570 Okay, so, did he fight back?
635770 637296 No, literally, how did it go?<br />Did he fight back?
637320 639046 - I hope you broke a bone.<br />- If you need a shoulder
639070 640490 or anything, just let me know...
640690 642216 I heard you did something<br />to him, I just don't know what.
642240 643466 ...and I'll totally let you<br />lean on me.
643490 645330 No, but like honestly,<br />how did you do it?
645530 647040 Oh, my God.<br />Annie, they went to juvie.
647240 648240 That's how, okay?
648370 650000 Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

678020 679990 Fuck.
680190 681916 <i>We haven't faced the violence<br />of Huntington for 20 years.</i>
681940 683410 <i>They think they can get<br />in our heads</i>
683610 685620 <i>by picking on our weak<br />and defenseless.</i>
685820 687676 <i>Well, we can't let them<br />break our spirit, folks.</i>
687700 689210 <i>Keep your heads in the game.</i>
689410 690410 They're gonna pork us!
690490 691710 - We're fucked!<br />- I'm screwed.
691910 693226 Hey. Hey, calm down<br />just a little bit.
693250 694720 Oh, great. More violence.
694910 696030 Just what this school needs.
697420 698620 Seriously, that's...<br />that's it?
698750 700600 - That's class?<br />- Latte.
700800 701800 Get my shit.
701880 703560 Solid class.
705090 706160 Hey.
707580 710110 Josie, right?
710310 713630 I heard you, like, beat up<br />my boyfriend last night?
714420 717610 Um, weren't you there?
717810 719570 I heard you guys ate<br />literal shit
719770 721950 - and killed girls in juvie.<br />- Really?
722150 724410 Um, what did you think<br />about that?
724610 725950 <i>Excuse me.</i>
726150 728670 <i>Could the ugly, untalented gays</i>
728870 730630 <i>please report<br />to the principal's office?</i>
730830 732630 Guess that's you guys.
732830 735430 Hello, Principal Meyers. First<br />of all, I want to say, God bless...
735460 737880 - Shut up. You know why you're here.<br />- I don't, actually...
738080 739590 For committing a crime<br />against Jeff.
739790 742050 Our quarterback<br />and the most good-looking,
742250 744890 all-American, red-blooded,<br />muscular man this town has ever seen.
745090 746146 Sir, please, look in the mirror.
746170 747640 - Shush.<br />- Okay.
747840 752060 The homecoming game with<br />Huntington is nearly a month away.
752260 753616 Do you know how long we've<br />been working toward this?
753640 755190 - Yes.<br />- Yes. It's everywhere.
755390 756656 - Twenty years.<br />- Couldn't be clearer.
756680 757680 I think I can explain.
757770 758900 I can explain.
759100 760950 Jeff is psychotic,<br />and he tried to murder us.
761150 762450 Ha! Sure.
762650 764910 You're all victims, and girls<br />are always right. Right?
765110 766250 Yeah, actually.
766440 768330 How come you can't buck up
768530 771040 and learn to protect yourselves<br />without running somebody over?
771240 774210 Maybe it's because we're small<br />and he's giant.
774410 776960 So, we needed to use<br />a little machinery.
777160 778550 Did you ever think of that, sir?
778750 780896 - Can we just explain ourselves?<br />- Maybe I should buy a gun.
780920 783160 Okay. What? What? Don't buy<br />a gun. Nobody said buy a gun.
783250 785060 - Can we just calm down, everybody.<br />- Zip it.
785260 786770 - You know what?<br />- What?
786970 789310 - I'm gonna expel you both.<br />- No!
789510 790890 - No! No!<br />- Yes! Yes!
791090 794400 You have to understand that<br />this was a misunderstanding.
794600 797670 - Really?<br />- We were just practicing...
799460 800800 for...
805720 806760 for our self-defense club.
809180 810830 Self-defense... What is that?
811030 813290 - Uh...<br />- Is it like a fight club?
813490 815340 - Well, here's the thing...<br />- Yes! Yes!
815540 817300 - Uh...<br />- Yes! Yes!
817500 818630 A fight club.
818830 821130 Where we fuckin' beat<br />each other up and shit.
821330 822330 - No, we don't.<br />- Yes.
822420 823590 No, we don't. Shut up.
823790 825226 Okay, you know what?<br />I don't care. Fuck it!
825250 826606 - I don't care.<br />- You're over it, okay.
826630 828470 Yeah. You can beat the shit<br />out of each other
828670 830270 <i>while you perform<br />The Vagina Monologues.</i>
830470 832990 Just stay in your lane until you're<br />munching beaver at Wesleyan.
833180 834810 Yes, sir.
835010 837326 I can't believe they're letting<br />you guys start a fight club.
837350 839530 No, they're... they're not.<br />We are not.
839730 841206 What are you talking about?<br />We're gonna do it.
841230 842230 We're doing it.
842310 844030 PJ, I wasn't being serious.
844230 847620 Josie, did you see the way that<br />Isabel and Brittany were looking at us?
847820 850410 Also, you heard<br />the announcements.
850610 851620 Girls are terrified.
851820 853330 It's perfect. They need this.
853530 855960 Okay, no. They need,<br />like, mace, maybe.
856160 859170 We can't do that, okay?<br />We'd be misleading them.
859370 860596 Guys do that all the time, okay?
860620 861766 That's the point of feminism.
861790 863070 That's not the point<br />of feminism.
863170 864840 You also don't care<br />about feminism.
865040 866316 <i>Your favorite show is Entourage.</i>
866340 867680 You're missing the point!
867880 869856 I don't really think I am.<br />We don't know how to fight.
869880 871396 You guys probably<br />fought girls in juvie.
871420 873020 No, we were lying about that,<br />obviously.
873220 874520 About juvie?
874720 876526 - Yeah, I mean, what?<br />- Why would you lie to me?
876550 877946 You were the one who said<br />we went to juvie.
877970 879190 I just didn't correct you.
879390 881490 Listen, self-defense<br />is instinctual common sense.
881680 883956 You try to punch me in the<br />face, I stop it from happening.
883980 885950 Whatever. I don't care.<br />It's easy.
886150 888200 Look, this is how we do this.
888400 889620 Okay, we start with Taekwondo.
889820 890990 Which I've got covered.
891190 893120 And then you guys can move<br />on to air punches.
893320 894320 Hub-bub-bub-bub.
894410 895790 Who do we know?<br />Who do we know?
895990 897040 I'll bring Stella-Rebecca.
897240 898590 You know Stella-Rebecca?
898790 900510 Stella-Rebecca who models<br />at car conventions
900540 902636 - in Chicago on the weekends?<br />- Yeah, we're family friends.
902660 904630 Okay, great.<br />Well, then bring her.
905920 907470 - Josie.<br />- What?
907670 908970 - We're doing this.<br />- No.
909170 910680 Yeah. Listen to me.
910880 912606 We teach a bunch of girls<br />how to defend themselves
912630 915440 against the evil,<br />Huntington killers.
915640 917100 They are grateful to us.
917300 919650 We build a community, we bond,
919850 921900 we share, we connect.
922100 924900 We're punching each other,<br />adrenaline is flowing.
925100 926360 Next thing you know,
926560 928286 Isabel and Brittany<br />are kissing us on the mouths.
928310 929590 - Jeffrey!<br />- Josie...
930680 932700 Isabel knew your name.
932900 934790 - Back from the dead.<br />- If we do this...
934990 937000 - Mmm-hmm.<br />- Very big "if,"
937200 938630 we just run the risk of becoming
938830 940716 even bigger losers<br />than we already are right now.
940740 943060 And I hate to break it to you,<br />but we're pretty big losers.
943120 945260 And that is the beauty.<br />That is the beauty of this.
945460 947930 Because we are literally<br />at the bottom.
948130 949250 We're the lowest of the low.
949290 950810 - Okay.<br />- We have nowhere to go but up.
950840 953770 Listen, I think this is<br />a good idea, okay?
953970 956440 There's a serious lack of<br />female solidarity at this school.
956630 958650 Not the point, Hazel.<br />Not the point.
958850 961150 Yeah, I mean, we just felt like
961350 963830 there's a serious lack of<br />female solidarity at this school.
965040 967710 Anyways, totally come by.<br />See you later.
969010 970700 What's your plan here?
970900 972410 I don't need a plan.
972610 974590 My mom has a business.<br />All we have to do is yell.
980810 981880 Okay.
982080 983140 What's up, lads?
984310 985340 What the fuck?
985540 987420 - These girls are ugly.<br />- Okay.
987620 988930 Where is Stella?
989130 990550 She was booked<br />for a car convention.
990750 992180 What? It's a Monday.
992380 993850 Um, maybe we should go
994050 995210 before someone cool shows up?
995260 996640 Before I die? Pick one.
996840 999230 Hey, Hazel.<br />Thanks for the invite.
999430 1001190 I love David Fincher.
1001390 1003730 - Oh, my God. Well...<br />- See?
1003930 1006740 I guess Sylvie's cute<br />if she lost her braces
1006930 1008320 and stopped huffing paint.
1008520 1010160 She'll never stop huffing paint.
1010350 1011430 So, I thought we'd start...
1011520 1012520 Um...
1013430 1014430 - Okay.<br />- Sorry.
1015470 1016620 All right.
1016820 1019870 Listen up, you<br />cunt-sucking pieces of shit.
1020070 1021630 Welcome to our fucking<br />fight club.
1021820 1023460 Um, it's a self-defense club.
1023660 1024800 It's not really, "Fight."
1024990 1028380 So, as we know,<br />Huntington is on the prowl,
1028580 1030090 and they're picking on the weak
1030290 1032760 and defenseless,<br />meaning all of you.
1032960 1035470 So, we're gonna teach you<br />how to not take shit.
1035670 1037640 We're gonna start<br />with dropkicks,
1037840 1039940 tackling, little bit<br />of knife play.
1040130 1041600 Then, punch-bucket,
1041800 1043610 which is when we throw you<br />in a bucket
1043810 1045770 and we punch you<br />until you bleed.
1045970 1049820 Before that, perhaps stretches,<br />icebreakers, and trust falls.
1050020 1051206 Is that what happened<br />to you in juvie?
1051230 1053160 - Mmm. No. No.<br />- No.
1053360 1055240 Juvie was way crazier.
1055440 1057330 One time, this girl's<br />punching me in the rain.
1057530 1059450 Fall to my knees. It's muddy.
1059650 1062290 I get up. I'm blind.
1062490 1064730 Punch her right<br />in the middle of her face.
1065690 1066690 Broke her fuckin' nose.
1067560 1068560 Josie?
1068700 1069730 Care to share?
1072230 1073360 Yeah, all right.
1074900 1076140 Juvie was insane.
1076340 1079470 Once a girl tried to kill me<br />with rat poison,
1079670 1082450 so I took her outside and<br />I punched her till she died.
1084500 1085810 So, you killed a girl?
1086010 1087690 Uh, no.
1087890 1090860 Because the ambulance came<br />and revived her
1091060 1093200 and we actually had a really<br />productive conversation
1093400 1095160 when she came back<br />to life, so...
1095360 1097990 Um, since Josie<br />literally killed a girl...
1098190 1099790 She came back to life.
1099990 1102550 Mmm. But I remember her being<br />dead for at least a couple minutes.
1102660 1104460 Josie is gonna start<br />by showing you all
1104660 1106630 how to effectively throw<br />a solid punch.
1106830 1108060 Josie, if you'll step forward.
1109060 1110380 No, I don't wanna do that.
1110580 1112556 - What's the problem?<br />- There's no problem. I just...
1112580 1113970 No, I'm just not gonna do it.
1114170 1115550 Come on, they wanna see<br />the punch.
1115750 1117896 - They don't wanna see it.<br />- They wanna see. Look at them.
1117920 1119060 They wanna see the punch.
1119260 1120260 Who am I gonna punch?
1120340 1121520 Punch me. Just punch me.
1121720 1123190 - Punch you?<br />- Yeah, come on.
1123380 1124380 I can punch you.
1124470 1125770 Yeah. I know how<br />to take a punch.
1125970 1127290 Something people<br />would always say,
1127350 1128446 "PJ knows how<br />to take a punch."
1128470 1129520 Come on up.
1129720 1131840 Oh!
1132670 1133670 Oh, fuck!
1141010 1142410 Will there an advisor<br />for this club?
1142450 1144090 Because we'll be suspended<br />if there isn't.
1144200 1146080 Who is gonna be dumb enough<br />to endorse a club
1146280 1148140 where we punch each other<br />in the face?
1149480 1152110 The Holocaust. It happened.
1153310 1154800 Yes, it did.
1155000 1157890 <i>But how? The seeds were sown<br />in the Treaty of Versailles,</i>
1158090 1160890 which y'all are gonna reenact while<br />I do some little reading over here.
1161010 1162780 I mean, he's perfect.
1163620 1164810 No.
1165010 1166100 - What?<br />- No.
1166300 1167690 Please.
1167890 1169616 Dude, we're not fucking<br />doing this. I broke your nose.
1169640 1171496 Yeah, and I've never had so<br />many girls look at me in my life.
1171520 1172610 Fuck! When did you show up?
1172810 1174110 Hey, guys.
1174310 1176660 I just wanted to say thank you<br />so much for last night.
1176850 1179700 It was just so great,<br />and I was thinking,
1179900 1181666 like, if Huntington and me were<br />in an alleyway
1181690 1184620 and they were coming at me<br />with, like, swords and, like, knives
1184820 1186410 and, like, guns and stuff,
1186610 1189630 and you taught me how to<br />punch like that, then I wouldn't die.
1189830 1192130 - That's so great, Sylvie.<br />- Okay.
1192330 1193380 But, unfortunately,
1193580 1195220 Josie doesn't want<br />to do the club anymore.
1195290 1196880 What? Why?
1197080 1198080 I don't know.
1198170 1199760 Why? It was just<br />so empowering.
1199960 1201050 What was empowering?
1201250 1204020 Oh, my God, hi. Um...
1204220 1206270 Just, we have a fight club.<br />It was our fight club
1206470 1209400 for, um, female solidarity<br />at this school, which we lack.
1209600 1211960 Isabel, let's go.
1216540 1218990 Hi, boo-boo.
1219190 1220450 I'm so strong.
1224140 1225140 I mean...
1229390 1232540 Mr. G, G-man, G-dog.
1232740 1234050 Great class today.
1234250 1236050 Hey, uh, girl.
1236250 1237550 Thanks for coming in today.
1237750 1239840 We have to come in.<br />It's class.
1240040 1242050 Try telling Dimitri Walker that.
1242250 1245390 Little motherfucker came the first<br />week and I ain't seen him since.
1245590 1246980 Dimitri Walker committed suicide
1247170 1248730 the first week of school,<br />Mr. G.
1248930 1251230 Sure, he did.
1251430 1255650 Anyways, um, we were wondering<br />if you wanted to be our club advisor.
1255850 1257860 - What kind of club is that?<br />- It's a women's club.
1258060 1259800 We talk about women's issues.
1260800 1262970 For example, periods,
1263760 1265040 declining egg count,
1265230 1266230 skirts...
1266400 1267450 Skirts?
1267650 1270330 But long ones.<br />Long denim skirts.
1270530 1273630 Feminism is what she's saying.<br />Feminism as a... as a whole.
1273830 1275790 Why don't you just ask<br />one of the female teachers?
1275910 1277476 Mmm. Thought about that,<br />but we hate them.
1277500 1278300 - Makes sense.<br />- Yeah.
1278500 1280050 Listen. I'm kind of,
1280250 1282300 you know, retiling the bathroom.
1282500 1284970 - Mmm-hmm.<br />- Uh, I gotta be at the co-op.
1285170 1287970 And I'm also dealing with<br />some relationship drama, so...
1288170 1289770 Back to the club,
1289970 1291816 maybe this will be a great<br />way to take your mind off of stuff.
1291840 1293360 Can I be honest?<br />You're a man
1293550 1295030 who's not coping<br />with what's going on.
1295180 1296440 - Yeah.<br />- You know what?
1296640 1299070 My mom did say I need<br />to pick up a hobby.
1299270 1300280 And here's one thing
1300480 1301786 - my mom's always said to me.<br />- Mmm.
1301810 1304740 Sometimes, when you have<br />a new hobby,
1304940 1306370 - don't show up.<br />- Yeah.
1306570 1308700 It's, like, you can be<br />our club advisor,
1308900 1310796 - but you don't even come to the dang club.<br />- No.
1310820 1312750 By the way,<br />great way to be an ally.
1312950 1314176 That's my favorite way<br />to be an ally.
1314200 1316170 You just say<br />you're doing something
1316370 1318010 and then you don't do<br />any of those things.
1318120 1320266 You know what I mean? You<br />say, "I support women." You don't.
1320290 1321720 Don't come. Yeah.
1321920 1325570 You know what? I'll sign off<br />on your period club.
1326400 1327560 - Amazing.<br />- What?
1327760 1328810 - Yeah.<br />- Really?
1329010 1330160 - Okay.<br />- So cool.
1336000 1337980 How many girls go<br />to this school, again?
1338180 1341740 Oh, my God, and again,<br />they're all sixes at best.
1341940 1343050 Hey, guys.
1344550 1346780 Mmm. Well, at least<br />Stella-Rebecca is here.
1346980 1349910 Are you stressed?<br />Because I'm stressed.
1350110 1351960 Hey, ladies.
1352150 1354100 Let's get it popping<br />in this motherfucker.
1355140 1356310 All right. Um...
1357600 1358600 Hello, everybody.
1359270 1360630 Okay, excuse me.
1360830 1362090 Sorry, I feel... Sorry.
1362290 1363380 Um...
1366820 1368610 Everybody, shut the fuck up!
1376620 1379250 This isn't a little<br />hangout, okay?
1380580 1383700 Oh, it's not a sleepover,<br />playtime.
1383890 1388170 There are serious rules that<br />we need to establish, 'kay?
1389970 1391050 First...
1392390 1393390 listen.
1393890 1394890 Second,
1395970 1398640 be on time.
1399690 1401210 Yeah.
1401410 1403090 Except for you.<br />You come whenever you want.
1404690 1406130 What time is it?
1406330 1407930 - 3:30.<br />- 3:30!
1408130 1410610 Club starts at 3:15.
1411860 1413200 Not 3:16.
1414160 1416810 Not 3:17,
1417010 1421360 but the doors close at 3:15.
1421560 1423170 No exceptions.
1424170 1425820 I don't care if you're like...
1426020 1428660 "Oh, but I had to go<br />to extra help for math
1428860 1432450 because I... I need<br />to get a full ride
1432650 1434000 because my mom<br />lives in a trailer
1434200 1436250 and she loves her boyfriend<br />more than me."
1436450 1438420 La, la, la. Blah, blah, blah.
1438620 1440040 Shut up, okay?
1440240 1443690 My dad left me,<br />and I'm incredibly punctual.
1450570 1452600 Um, hey, guys. Come on in.
1452800 1453890 Nice.
1454090 1455850 Uh, we're just getting<br />started here.
1456050 1457540 So, um...
1459290 1461406 Today I think we're gonna<br />start with some body contact.
1461430 1462980 We're gonna do wrestling.
1463180 1465280 I think I need a volunteer.
1465480 1467120 Brittany, you're close to me.<br />You wanna...
1467230 1469230 I'm sorry. I thought<br />we weren't allowed to be late.
1469310 1471706 - That's not true. It's about...<br />- Oh, that's about next week.
1471730 1473046 - Yeah, next week.<br />- So, the rules for next week.
1473070 1474290 Don't be late.
1474490 1475716 - But this week is good...<br />- Yeah. No worries.
1475740 1476966 ...if you're late.<br />Take it easy.
1476990 1478176 Okay, I'm sorry.<br />I just want to make sure.
1478200 1480000 This is a self-defense<br />class, right?
1480200 1481426 Where we can learn<br />to protect ourselves
1481450 1482880 against, like, football players.
1483080 1485960 And Huntington? 'Cause, um,<br />they're gonna pork us.
1486160 1488380 They're gonna pork us.
1488580 1490470 I thought we were fighting<br />each other for money.
1490670 1491890 There's a cash prize, right?
1492090 1493850 I thought this was<br />to be part of, like,
1494050 1496240 a local underprivileged<br />female community.
1498160 1500060 My identity is completely<br />attached to hers,
1500260 1502690 so I just kind of go<br />wherever she goes.
1502890 1504036 Everyone's here<br />for a good reason.
1504060 1505400 So, uh, you know, like...
1505600 1508990 - Why are we nitpicking reasons?<br />- Yeah. How about this?
1509190 1510990 - Let's jump in. Right?<br />- Yeah. For sure.
1511190 1512410 - Love that.<br />- Yeah.
1512610 1514510 - I'll go.<br />- Great. Yeah.
1518600 1521250 Hey, hey, hey, hey. hey.
1521450 1522610 I don't know about this shit.
1522780 1525000 What the hell?<br />You didn't even warn me.
1525200 1527090 Okay, we didn't get<br />warnings at juvie.
1527290 1528530 - Look.<br />- We can take it slower.
1528710 1529950 - Okay.<br />- Maybe, yeah, try that.
1530120 1531550 Take that route.<br />Little slower.
1531750 1534100 Look. You just use your<br />natural instincts, just come at me.
1534300 1535360 Whatever you want, 'kay?
1536490 1537520 Oh, fuck.
1537720 1538850 Okay.
1539050 1541480 That's great.<br />I say that we go again.
1541680 1543150 - Oh!<br />- Ow, fuck! My back.
1543350 1545230 Oh, shit.<br />Man, we gotta shut this down.
1545430 1546996 We don't have to shut it down.<br />She's fine.
1547020 1548616 - Are you fine? Are you okay?<br />- Yeah, she's okay.
1548640 1550360 - She's totally fine.<br />- Shut this shit down.
1550560 1552360 - No, wait, Mr. G.<br />- Shut this shit down.
1552560 1553956 No, don't blow the whistle.<br />Don't blow the whistle.
1553980 1555700 I know that,
1555900 1558580 you know, this is<br />a little messy right now
1558780 1560620 but, like, the only way
1560820 1564060 that we can learn how to defend<br />ourselves is by teaching each other.
1565690 1567380 Huntington is coming.
1569290 1570310 We need this.
1571860 1574800 I know that things<br />might seem scary,
1575000 1577030 but that's okay, because...
1579070 1580070 because...
1580260 1583140 Because you're gonna<br />be fucking pros.
1583340 1584860 - Is what I was gonna say. Yes.<br />- Yeah.
1585010 1586230 - Right?<br />- Yes.
1586430 1588480 Crystal, I'm thinking of you.
1588680 1591440 You are never gonna get<br />assaulted on your birthday again.
1591640 1593200 - Lucky number seven, okay?<br />- Mmm-hmm.
1593400 1596740 And I... I'm gonna finally<br />reverse-stalk my stalker.
1596940 1598330 Yeah, absolutely.
1598530 1599530 And for me,
1599690 1601390 I'll be able<br />to kill my step dad.
1602760 1603790 - Awesome.<br />- Okay.
1603990 1605270 And if you believe in yourselves
1605320 1607420 and you believe in us<br />and then you trust us,
1607620 1609500 I'm like,<br />"Let's fucking do this!"
1609700 1610960 - Yeah!<br />- Yeah?
1611160 1613090 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah. Okay.
1613290 1614550 So good.
1614750 1617050 Yeah! Yes!
1617250 1618450 - Yeah!<br />- Yeah!
1620110 1623230 Yes! Yes, queen, slay!
1623430 1625350 Yes! Yes!
1625550 1628690 Slay! Yeah!
1631430 1632430 Cool.
1633590 1635320 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah. I'm just gonna go.
1635520 1636530 Yeah, for sure.

1798270 1800240 You little bitch,<br />it's actually working.
1800440 1801490 I told you.
1801690 1803126 I know. I feel like<br />if we keep it up,
1803150 1804910 we can actually take on<br />Huntington, you guys.
1804980 1807540 No, if we keep it up,<br />we can put our fingers
1807730 1809410 inside of each other. Grow up.
1809610 1810610 All right.
1810740 1812120 You know, PJ,
1812320 1814176 I feel like people are<br />actually liking more than just
1814200 1816040 the hitting and the tackling<br />part of the club.
1816240 1818420 Yeah, I know.<br />We're empowering them. Duh.
1818620 1821340 No, I mean, seriously, to<br />have a safe space like this,
1821540 1822930 it means a lot to people,
1823130 1825390 and I think that if we took<br />some time to spend a meeting
1825590 1827140 and actually get<br />to know these girls,
1827340 1829640 like, it would be<br />really important,
1829840 1831870 instead of just, like,<br />sweating on them and...
1835120 1839480 Hazel, that is a genuinely<br />brilliant idea.
1839680 1841246 - Yeah.<br />- I love talking about my trauma.
1841270 1845280 I literally jack off<br />after every single
1845480 1846570 - therapy session.<br />- What?
1846770 1849370 It just makes girls<br />weirdly horny. It does.
1849570 1850796 <i>- Don't say "girls." It's you.<br />- Bonjour.</i>
1850820 1852750 I just wanted to say
1852950 1855000 I'm loving what I'm hearing<br />about the club.
1855200 1856560 It seems so supportive of women.
1857480 1858710 Especially the hot ones.
1858910 1860550 Yeah, well,<br />all women are hot to me.
1860750 1862510 Listen, it's really cute<br />and everything,
1862710 1867510 but we're getting a little close<br />to the game now and, um...
1867710 1868850 I'm just a bit concerned
1869050 1870970 it might be taking away<br />attention from our team.
1871170 1875370 I think that's, like,<br />literally impossible to do.
1877540 1878540 Okay.
1882170 1884860 So, we know<br />that the club has been a place
1885060 1886910 where we can feel<br />empowered physically,
1887110 1889700 but we also thought it could be
1889900 1892370 a safe space and a place<br />where we can open up
1892570 1893890 and talk about our feelings.
1895720 1897640 Okay, so who's been raped?
1898730 1900010 Just, you know, raise your hand.
1902100 1903730 Gray area stuff counts too.
1909400 1911860 Everybody knows the situation<br />with my step dad.
1913910 1918940 He's just obsessed<br />with Friday movie nights.
1919140 1922830 I mean, God, I get it,<br />you're my new step dad, but...
1923630 1924630 fuck, whatever.
1924770 1926200 You know?
1926400 1928530 Every time I call the police<br />about my stalker,
1928730 1930740 they tell me to fill out<br />an online form.
1930940 1932830 And then the form<br />tells me to call,
1933030 1936120 so I call and then they say they can't<br />get involved until he tries to kill me.
1936320 1937720 And he keeps saying<br />he's going to...
1938520 1939540 but that doesn't count.
1939740 1941630 So, it's just, like, annoying.
1941830 1943060 Been there.
1944190 1945460 We've all been there.
1945660 1948260 Well, I've been assaulted,<br />like, a million times,
1948460 1950550 but I'm more annoyed
1950750 1954850 that everyone knows me for<br />being beautiful and popular
1955050 1957940 and no one knows that I'm<br />actually smart and super driven.
1958140 1961910 Like, I literally own a jewelry<br />business and no one talks about it!
1963620 1964940 See?
1965140 1967570 Well, ever since<br />my parents' divorce,
1967770 1970530 my mom has been doing this,<br />like, midlife crisis.
1970730 1973200 I don't know how that's really<br />sitting with me, you know?
1973400 1975120 It's been really, really dark.
1975320 1977296 This has just been really<br />meaningful to me to, like,
1977320 1981630 get to know some new people who<br />actually want to, like, get to know me.
1981830 1984591 - I want to bring it back to Brittany for one second.<br />- I can go next,
1985020 1986230 if that's okay.
1988320 1992180 I don't really like talking<br />about juvie
1992380 1995100 and everything that happened<br />this summer, um...
1995300 1998270 You know, obviously, we<br />get a lot of props or whatever
1998470 1999870 'cause people think<br />it's so bad ass.
2000990 2003560 But, really wasn't.
2003760 2008240 I mean, unless you consider getting<br />hazed horrifically every single night,
2008440 2010570 like, bad ass. I mean, um,
2010770 2013950 obviously, you know,<br />we had to survive the Tributes
2014150 2016040 and, you know,<br />I did have to, like,
2016230 2018080 fight people basically<br />every single night.
2018280 2021290 People were betting on us<br />and we were given, like,
2021490 2024750 shivs and rusty pocket knives<br />and splintered wood
2024950 2027090 and, um, pipes as well.
2027290 2030300 And, um, we had to just, like,<br />fight people, sometimes to the death.
2030500 2032220 Um, and I still hear<br />their screams at night,
2032330 2035490 um, and that guilt probably will,<br />like, always shackle me forever.
2037280 2040600 I realize now, I don't have<br />to be that person anymore.
2040800 2043440 Like, I don't have<br />to just let things
2043640 2047020 happen to me 'cause of you guys.
2047220 2050030 And, um, I am,<br />like, really grateful
2050230 2052610 for what the club<br />has become and...
2052810 2054320 Um...
2054520 2056930 Just especially, you know,<br />from where we started and, uh...
2058800 2060000 Yeah, sorry.
2060200 2061620 I feel like<br />I kinda killed the vibe.
2061820 2062870 I've never really,
2063070 2066290 I guess, said that<br />to anyone before. Sorry.
2066490 2068050 People wanna, like,<br />wrap up maybe or...
2068250 2069560 I'm going through a divorce.
2070940 2073680 Whoo! That shit felt<br />good to say.
2073880 2075180 Ooh, I'll tell y'all,
2075380 2077320 men... men need therapy.
2078240 2079930 Yeah.
2080130 2082870 I think that's a good place<br />to maybe wrap up.
2093340 2094340 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
2095210 2096220 Um...
2097550 2099010 Thank you, um, for that.
2101430 2102430 Um...
2104140 2107040 I don't know<br />what you're doing tomorrow,
2107240 2111420 but I was going to study for Mr. G's<br />women murdered in history test,
2111620 2113820 if you wanna...
2117320 2118360 Yeah.
2119400 2120660 Yeah, okay, sure.
2124590 2125590 Mom?
2132480 2133630 Mom?
2137670 2139030 Oh, hi, honey.
2139230 2140720 What are you doing home<br />so early?
2145660 2146660 Uh...
2147350 2148480 Are you kidding me?
2149480 2152150 I had a long day.
2153650 2155190 Mrs. Callahan,<br />can I have a snack?
2157780 2159220 First club fundraiser.
2159420 2161890 I'm so excited.<br />Great turnout, right?
2162090 2164310 Hello, ladies.
2164510 2165810 Hi, Bill, Bob, Fred...
2166010 2168116 I don't know why anyone<br />wants my old, dirty underwear.
2168140 2169560 It's so weird.
2169760 2172150 Hey, Britt, uh, don't let 'em<br />touch in between your toes.
2172350 2173400 Thanks, PJ.
2173600 2175110 Ah. We're havin' fun.
2175310 2176700 We're selling panties.
2176900 2179100 You know, Brittany said she'd<br />make me a custom bracelet.
2180800 2181800 Very nice.
2181940 2183120 Do you wanna, um, celebrate?
2183320 2185080 We could get some chicken<br />on a stick tonight.
2185970 2188970 Um, I can't. Uh...
2190230 2192670 Isabel and I have plans, so...
2194160 2195880 You're hanging out with Isabel?
2196080 2197130 Yep.
2197330 2199390 Fuck, you're fast.<br />Oh, my God, okay.
2199580 2201220 I have to keep up.
2201420 2202560 Hazel, what is wrong?
2202750 2204030 Are you constipated<br />or something?
2204130 2205270 I'm fucking tired.
2205470 2207600 My mom was up all night<br />fucking the meat head.
2207800 2209560 What meat head?<br />Hi. Underwear, cars.
2209760 2211156 - Thanks.<br />- You know, like, the guy.
2211180 2212540 He's like the crybaby.
2214790 2215900 With the balls?
2216100 2218300 He catches them<br />and he... he throws them?
2220090 2222050 He's like the main guy.
2223220 2224220 Jeff?
2225260 2226540 Is your mom hooking up<br />with Jeff?
2226610 2229000 I just thought Jeff might be<br />her safe word.
2229200 2230670 Jeff is his name, you idiot.
2230870 2232790 Just get the hot people<br />confused, Jesus.
2234490 2235490 I'm good.
2235660 2237170 Looking good, Stella!
2238670 2239670 Are you gonna tell her?
2242690 2244970 Yeah, they said<br />they were in juvie this summer.
2245170 2247370 Okay, are you sure<br />they're not in the system?
2249530 2251650 But isn't every kid from<br />Rock bridge Falls sent there?
2251720 2252720 Hit me! Ow!
2254460 2256380 Okay, yeah, Essex County.<br />Any others?
2258590 2259610 Got it. Thank you.
2267180 2268200 Jeff!
2274200 2277550 No, yeah, but I thought<br />she was maybe dead.
2277750 2279260 - Not good.<br />- That's not the best.
2279460 2282340 - No. No, not great.<br />- That's not a great thing.
2288240 2289730 I wanted to...
2289920 2292390 I wanted to tell you<br />that, um, I'm...
2292590 2294330 I'm very glad<br />that I joined the club.
2295830 2296830 Me too.
2298750 2301150 I think it's really impressive
2301350 2304370 that you and PJ went through<br />everything that you did
2304560 2307830 and now have decided<br />to help the rest of us.
2308030 2310300 I mean even that story<br />you told the other day.
2311560 2313540 You're really, really brave.
2313740 2314960 No.
2315160 2316380 No. No, no.
2316580 2319710 Yes. I mean you almost<br />killed a girl.
2319910 2320910 You're...
2321980 2322980 Yeah, you're...
2324190 2325570 really, really brave.
2329070 2330070 What?
2335120 2336710 Actually, Isabel, uh...
2338040 2339650 - There's, um...<br />- Yeah?
2339850 2342190 There's something<br />you maybe should know.
2342390 2343500 Uh...
2345380 2347660 I mean it's pretty insane.
2347860 2349550 Okay.<br />What... what is it?
2351550 2352550 I just, I...
2355970 2357460 I heard Jeff is cheating on you.
2361770 2363730 Wait...
2366990 2368100 Wait, what?
2368290 2371390 I... I... Sorry, I think I...<br />I heard...
2371590 2376480 Um, what? Um...<br />Who... who told you that?
2376680 2381360 Hazel told me that, uh,<br />he and Mrs. Callahan
2381560 2385070 are at it, pretty much,<br />like, every night,
2385270 2387950 like, constantly.
2388150 2392080 I mean, just at it with each<br />other, which is pretty fucked up.
2392280 2395160 Um, even though I guess<br />it's, technically, it's legal,
2395360 2397170 it's still just<br />pretty nasty, uh...
2397370 2398790 Oh.
2409780 2411140 Thanks.
2413090 2416100 Jeff so hungy.<br />Hungy hungy, hungy.
2416300 2417730 Jeff so hungy.
2417930 2418950 Swoosh!
2424140 2425360 What the fuck is this?
2425560 2426640 Is there pineapple in this?
2427340 2428820 We talked about this, Janice.
2429020 2430300 Jeffrey's allergic to pineapple.
2433550 2434550 Eat a bag of dicks.
2440030 2442311 Well, I wasn't going to do it,<br />but this is the last straw.
2446650 2447690 How was last night?
2453490 2456850 Uh, bad, probably, I would say.
2457050 2458050 Wait, really?
2463080 2465040 She's walking really fast.
2467520 2468880 She usually walks a lot slower.
2471510 2473660 Hi.
2473860 2475340 Are you having sex<br />with Mrs. Callahan?
2477720 2480370 Baby, you look so beautiful.
2480570 2482540 Like, so fucking hot.<br />How... how are you?
2482740 2484920 Bad. Are you having sex<br />with her?
2485120 2486610 I'm... I'm...
2487940 2489590 helping her with her taxes.
2489790 2491150 Aren't you<br />in eighth grade algebra?
2491290 2493050 I can't answer that question
2493250 2494606 because I... I don't know<br />how to read.
2494630 2495830 She's asking you to your face!
2495920 2497270 Fuck, that usually works.
2497470 2500100 Are you cheating on me again?
2500300 2503310 Baby, no! No!
2503510 2504830 No, why would...<br />why would I do...
2504890 2507320 That was one time<br />with your sister, just once,
2507520 2508610 two, four times.
2508810 2511530 No, I would never cheat<br />on you again, okay?
2511730 2514620 I promise you<br />I am not sleeping with her.
2514820 2516120 I literally saw you yesterday.
2516320 2517740 Shut up, nerd!<br />I fucked your mom!
2517940 2519850 Mmm. Mmm.
2520760 2521870 Wait.
2522070 2524670 - Yeah, we're done.<br />- Isabel...
2528440 2530090 I'm getting revenge.
2530290 2532016 I'm gonna fuck up some football<br />players. And I'm buyin' a gun.
2532040 2533680 Hell yeah.<br />I'll get my step dad's.
2533880 2535140 What about, like, egging?
2535340 2536686 Yeah, so we can make 'em<br />not refrigerated and smelly?
2536710 2537896 Ooh, we could cook 'em<br />and be like...
2537920 2539120 - "You're cooked."<br />- Yes. Yeah.
2539260 2540380 Or what about, like, a bomb?
2542700 2544940 Like a...<br />like a super small bomb.
2545140 2546500 I mean, they're super easy<br />to make,
2546640 2548150 and I can just put it<br />under his car,
2548350 2549470 and it can be a distraction.
2551170 2553880 Yeah, Hazel, let's do terrorism.

2633390 2636050 'cause we could be fined,<br />like, $2 for this, so...

2647850 2649520 It's nice everybody's here,<br />like...
2650560 2651560 vandalizing...
2652440 2653440 Jeff's house.

2665240 2667270 I mean,<br />I think it's for the best.
2667470 2671400 But I did kind of miss<br />when he would touch my hair
2671600 2673670 and go, like,
2675250 2678990 "Shiny, shiny, shiny."<br />You know?
2679190 2682590 I wanted to tell you<br />this before, but...
2683930 2686040 I really appreciated<br />you fighting
2686240 2688850 and speaking loudly<br />at my boyfriend.
2689770 2691130 I really value
2691330 2693980 when people use violence<br />and raise their voices for me.
2696020 2698020 It's actually one<br />of my love languages.

2704210 2706780 everything is, like,<br />really fucked up and...
2708580 2711450 you still probably miss Jeff,<br />which I get,
2712330 2713820 but I just think
2714020 2717420 you deserve way better, Isabel.

2792220 2793696 Great. What are we supposed<br />to do now?
2793720 2795730 Relax. No one knows it's us.
2795930 2796930 Hey, guys.
2797870 2799000 Great show last night.
2800210 2801740 I don't know what<br />you're talking about.
2801940 2803780 Oh, you don't.<br />No, it's really all good.
2803980 2806050 Jeffrey needed a new car,<br />anyway, so...
2807550 2808550 don't worry about it.
2812350 2813430 What's wrong, Josie?
2814930 2815930 You seem a little off.
2823480 2825900 Your club is over.
2826820 2827820 You understand?
2830870 2831910 Good.
2833330 2834656 All right, well,<br />some of us clearly
2834680 2836160 have a different definition<br />of egging,
2836300 2839070 but if we keep our mouths<br />shut, stay calm, we'll be fine.
2839270 2840830 They're gonna shut us down,<br />aren't they?
2841210 2842280 What?
2842480 2843950 No. We don't know that.
2844150 2845786 - What... Why...<br />- Principal Meyers will believe
2845810 2847370 whatever Jeff and Tim say.
2847570 2849290 I don't really see how<br />we recover from this.
2850260 2851340 Man...
2852350 2853350 Fuck.
2853490 2854960 You know, it's been real, guys.
2855160 2857170 Okay, let's not jump<br />to conclusions
2857370 2859380 with the goodbyes and...
2859580 2861270 I'm gonna miss you guys so much.
2862980 2864760 And like, at least<br />we went out with a bang.
2864960 2866550 I mean, that was fucking insane!
2867920 2869510 There was just, like,<br />fire everywhere.
2869710 2871520 Wait. Stop.
2871710 2873810 We don't... Wait, no,<br />we don't know that for sure.
2874010 2877900 PJ, don't be sad it's over.<br />Be happy it happened.
2878100 2880610 All right, can everyone<br />calm the fuck down, please?
2880810 2883330 The club is not over,<br />Josie, right?
2884750 2885750 No matter what,
2886750 2888370 this club has brought me<br />so much.
2888560 2889560 I feel...
2890840 2894680 so much more powerful and, um...
2895640 2896640 protected.
2897770 2898830 Me too.
2899030 2900340 - Great.<br />- Oh, my God, PJ.
2900530 2902170 Okay, I'm sorry<br />that you didn't get
2902370 2903426 what you wanted<br />out of this group,
2903450 2905220 but I think the rest of us did.
2905410 2906800 Oh. Good for fucking you,<br />Hazel.
2907000 2909140 I'm glad that you finally<br />wrote one email.
2909340 2910890 - Accomplished a lot.<br />- I actually did.
2911090 2912970 I practically ran this club<br />for you and Josie.
2913170 2914680 Hey, let's calm down, maybe.
2914880 2917196 You really think that you're the<br />reason that we have this club?
2917220 2918270 The reason? No.
2918470 2919616 But I can tell everyone that<br />if you want.
2919640 2921900 Hazel. Uh, hey,<br />let's calm down, right?
2922100 2923480 You're really ungrateful.
2923680 2925706 You're so lucky that we<br />even let you be a part of this.
2925730 2927380 PJ, you're a liar.
2931730 2934040 Yeah, well, you have no friends,
2934240 2936390 and a skank as a mom, so...
2950490 2951940 Hazel.
2964750 2966190 This doesn't mean<br />it wasn't worth it.
2985690 2986710 Hazel.
2990400 2991530 Whoa.
2995530 2996530 I love God.
2997410 2998870 Yes, same.
3008000 3009530 Yeah.
3009730 3011800 Oh, my God, I always<br />wanted one of these.
3013720 3017330 But my mom says they hide<br />your figure and make you look ugly.
3017530 3019450 Um, you can borrow it<br />if you want.
3019650 3021350 Like, as a joke or...
3022470 3023500 whatever.
3023700 3024700 Thanks.
3024870 3025870 Yeah.
3032650 3034390 Wow, you and PJ
3034590 3036350 really have been<br />friends forever.
3036550 3039160 Oh, I mean,<br />since the first grade, so...
3040580 3042980 We had the same<br />babysitter, Rhodes.
3043180 3045870 PJ called her Gay Yoda, but I<br />think she's kind of like a mentor.
3049850 3052840 Yeah, but you guys, like,<br />could not be more different.
3053590 3054840 She's so, like...
3056260 3057260 like...
3058010 3059450 You know?
3059650 3060650 - Yeah.<br />- And you're...
3061550 3062560 You're so, like...
3069600 3071440 - You know what I mean?<br />- No, yeah, I know.
3075530 3076530 Josie...
3124740 3127060 I'm tryna help<br />your jewelry business grow.
3127260 3128730 - Really?<br />- Yeah.
3128930 3131330 I don't know if I can hire you<br />because you're like a convict.
3134170 3135450 Wow.
3135640 3139280 This is, um, a total shithole.
3145050 3146180 Kind of a mess. Sorry.
3150180 3152750 Well, I hear that<br />if you hire a convict,
3152950 3154150 they give you a tax break.
3158170 3160140 I fucking hate Mr. G.
3160340 3162430 Everything he says<br />is so pathetic.
3162630 3164640 Oh, yeah. I mean,
3164840 3167140 I feel like he, like,<br />jerks off to a poster
3167340 3170230 of the 1999 Rock bridge team<br />every single night, so...
3170430 3172290 Literally the peak<br />of his existence.
3183430 3185680 Like, what is the point<br />of this assignment?
3186970 3191210 Who is bell hooks<br />and why do we care?
3191410 3193730 Oh, sorry, I'm just trying to,<br />like, study over here.
3194850 3195980 Watch out.
3206370 3207370 What?
3208410 3210410 Uh, nothing, I'm just...
3212000 3214690 I'm just concerned<br />'cause I'm, like...
3214890 3219320 Your wrists are so small, and<br />the pen is so heavy that I'm like,
3219520 3221740 - "Is she getting exhausted?"<br />- Mmm.
3221940 3223820 I'm surprised you can even see<br />what you're doing
3223860 3224950 with all the surface area
3225150 3226180 that yours are taking up.
3227220 3228290 Wow.
3228490 3229836 Must be a struggle<br />for you to write.
3229860 3231250 Okay, does this hurt?
3231450 3233386 Actually, yeah, that does hurt<br />my tiny, delicate wrists.
3233410 3235130 Yeah, that was<br />the lightest tap of all time.
3235160 3236596 - Can you feel that?<br />- Can't even feel that.
3236620 3238660 - Can't feel anything.<br />- Just like muscles in there.
3247320 3248320 Um...
3248910 3249910 Uh...
3252080 3254370 PJ, I'm... I'm straight.
3259790 3260800 Oh.
3263510 3264590 Um...
3267300 3270080 Yeah. Um...
3270280 3273210 - I'm... I'm sorry if you misread anything.<br />- No, that's all...
3273410 3276190 It's all good. I shouldn't<br />have assumed anything.
3293290 3294910 Um...
3296210 3297500 I wanted to tell you something.
3298420 3300190 What?
3300390 3302920 Like, something that happened<br />last night.
3304590 3305720 What happened?
3307340 3308430 With Isabel.
3312760 3313760 Wait.
3317230 3318230 Wait, seriously?
3323020 3324650 That's... that's amazing.<br />That's...
3327130 3328510 <i>Everybody,</i>
3328710 3331270 <i>- even the fucking losers...<br />- Even the fucking losers!</i>
3331470 3334100 <i>...make some noise!</i>
3339170 3340650 I thought you were<br />super Christian.
3340850 3343780 I know. I just like getting<br />caught up in the festivities.
3343980 3345746 <i>All right, uh, so we're gonna<br />do the pep rally.</i>
3345770 3347160 <i>First up, cheerleaders.</i>
3361400 3362730 Football!
3365650 3368390 <i>Whoo! Yeah,<br />thank you, ladies. Ooh!</i>
3368590 3370930 <i>Thank you all for joining us<br />here today, folks.</i>
3371130 3372970 <i>There's been some</i>
3373170 3376060 <i>exciting stuff happening<br />at Rock bridge Falls recently.</i>
3376260 3377260 Oh.
3377750 3379650 <i>How many of you</i>
3379850 3383650 <i>know about that little girl<br />fight club that could?</i>
3385690 3387030 Ay, there go my girls.
3387230 3391280 <i>Well, do we have<br />a surprise for you.</i>
3391480 3394620 <i>We're gonna bring...<br />Where is she?</i>
3394820 3396930 <i>Hazel down.</i>
3398100 3400420 <i>One of the founding members.</i>
3400620 3402750 <i>To show us everything<br />the club's taught her</i>
3402950 3405260 <i>in a fun little challenge.</i>
3407000 3409590 - Let's go, Hazel!<br />- Go, Hazel!
3409790 3412450 - What is this?<br />- I... I don't know.
3415090 3417990 <i>Hazel will be fighting Tucker,</i>
3418910 3420750 <i>the school's number one boxer.</i>
3427880 3430030 Wait, I thought I was gonna be<br />fighting PJ?
3430230 3433030 <i>I know what you're thinking,<br />but don't be alarmed.</i>
3433230 3434830 <i>Girls can do anything<br />guys can do, right?</i>
3435030 3436220 Yeah, kick his ass!
3437890 3438890 <i>Ready?</i>
3439560 3440790 <i>- Fuck.<br />- Go.</i>
3456120 3457200 Oh, my God.
3461220 3462526 - You got this, Hazel.<br />- Come on, Hazel!
3462550 3464460 You got it.
3478930 3479970 Shit.
3481970 3483520 Whoo! Get him!
3497110 3498696 - The fuck are you doing?<br />- Is she, like,
3498720 3499770 sort of winning or...
3502970 3504660 No, leave the skin<br />on his face, will you?
3505830 3507780 Fuck.
3507980 3509360 Oh. Oh, my God.
3509560 3511070 <i>I know what you're thinking.</i>
3511270 3515550 <i>You may be wondering how<br />a girl under the training of...</i>
3516550 3519750 <i>of two juvie convicted killers</i>
3519950 3523290 <i>can't even stand up for<br />herself against a regular old guy.</i>
3525280 3527600 <i>Well, truth is, they...</i>
3530610 3531840 <i>they didn't go to juvie.</i>
3533130 3534130 <i>No.</i>
3536530 3537810 <i>There's no record of them there.</i>
3539530 3540600 <i>And according to Hazel...</i>
3543040 3544480 <i>...they never fought<br />anyone at all.</i>
3544680 3546480 <i>And you know what else?</i>
3546680 3550130 <i>They didn't start the club<br />to empower women.</i>
3551670 3554160 <i>They did it<br />to fuck cheerleaders.</i>
3557720 3559220 <i>What is wrong with you?</i>
3561800 3563430 <i>It is such a shame.</i>
3565640 3567880 <i>We were really rooting<br />for you girls.</i>
3569950 3571420 - Oh, my God.<br />- Oh, my God.
3571620 3573090 <i>Okay.</i>
3573290 3575340 <i>- Thank you for attending...<br />- Hazel!</i>
3575540 3577106 <i>- ...today's pep rally. Go Vikings! Fuck Huntington!<br />- Is she okay?</i>
3577130 3578390 <i>- Hazel!<br />- Whoo!</i>
3578590 3580110 <i>- Yes!<br />- Yes!</i>
3588620 3589710 Is that true?
3590580 3592190 That's why you started this?
3592390 3594860 No, no, no.
3595060 3596570 Not... not entirely.
3596770 3598280 Not entire... Okay.
3598480 3601290 Listen guys.<br />It doesn't matter...
3601490 3603930 the reason that we started<br />this, right? Like...
3604850 3606250 The point of the club
3606450 3610170 is that we all learn<br />from each other, right?
3610370 3613300 And... and we had a great time<br />doing it and...
3613500 3614846 I thought this club<br />was for sisterhood,
3614870 3617130 but it was for your own<br />selfish interests?
3617330 3618900 This is the second wave<br />all over again.
3624910 3626270 Isabel, please, please, wait.
3626470 3628730 PJ made me do this.<br />I didn't want to.
3628930 3630130 I would never want to do this.
3633580 3635130 You're pathetic, Josie.
3646890 3648250 Mr. G,<br />we're really sorry, we...
3648450 3649500 All right, look.
3649700 3651880 You know what?<br />I'm not a fuckin' idiot.
3652080 3653170 I just look like this.
3653370 3655420 I wasn't doin' this shit<br />as a distraction.
3655620 3658340 I actually was doin' this shit<br />'cause I actually liked y'all group
3658540 3659590 and what y'all stood for.
3659790 3662260 - Wait, we can explain.<br />- I trusted you two
3662460 3664600 and y'all exploited<br />my solidarity.
3664800 3667440 I played the role<br />of an amazin' ally.
3667630 3668810 Is this about the time I said
3669010 3670950 Amelia Earhart was a fake hero?
3671710 3673360 Because it's true.
3673560 3676610 Many a guy fly planes<br />without crashing,
3676810 3678010 but you never hear about them.
3678550 3680030 And then it's like,
3680230 3682410 "Oh, it's so hard<br />to be a girl."
3682610 3684080 "We, like, make less money."
3684280 3686120 "We had to lose<br />our last names."
3686320 3687580 "I love you."
3687780 3689716 "I want to be with you<br />for the rest of our lives."
3689740 3693170 "Oh, I love the mint green<br />back splash in the kitchen."
3693370 3694460 And all of a sudden,
3694660 3696340 you leave me<br />for a motherfucker named Tony
3696540 3699220 and suddenly, the fucking<br />kitchen is lime green.
3699420 3700680 I think...
3700880 3703180 Yeah, I think that moved<br />away from us.
3703380 3705680 Oh, you look confused, like<br />how I'm confused right now,
3705880 3708430 on how you created a fucking<br />fight club to get some cooch.
3708630 3711690 And for what? Y'all ain't even<br />know how to work that thing.
3711890 3713650 And I know y'all ain't<br />tickling the pearl,
3713850 3715076 you know what I'm talking about?
3715100 3716326 You know what I mean?<br />Caressing the back
3716350 3718110 of that neck and all type of...
3718310 3721230 Sorry, I just don't know if you're<br />supposed to be talking to us like that.
3721270 3722660 Just, like, as a teacher...
3722860 3724330 Man, I knew women were evil.
3724520 3727430 Motherfuckers always tellin'<br />me like, "No, that's not true."
3728470 3730470 But time and time again...
3735740 3738010 Women ain't nothing<br />but the fuckin' devil.
3738210 3741300 I can't fuckin' believe Hazel.
3741500 3744570 Okay, well, you were pretty<br />horrible to her yesterday.
3746030 3750430 I'm sorry, what?<br />This is... this is my fault?
3750630 3753770 I'm not the one who put Isabel<br />on a rampage.
3753970 3756070 Sorry, what does that have<br />to do with anything?
3756260 3758610 If Isabel wasn't so desperate<br />to get revenge,
3758810 3760410 then we wouldn't have<br />blown up Jeff's car
3760520 3762110 and then he wouldn't be so upset
3762310 3764626 and then whatever the fuck just<br />happened would not have happened.
3764650 3767490 Okay, so all of the blame<br />just goes on me then?
3767690 3770080 Like, none of this can<br />be traced back to you at all?
3770280 3773140 Well, I mean, yeah, it was<br />your idea to start the whole club.
3774520 3776840 I didn't want to do this<br />from the beginning.
3777040 3778920 You know that.
3779120 3782010 I just followed your lead<br />like an idiot.
3782210 3784840 You followed my lead when<br />you created that insane story
3785040 3788600 about girls betting on you<br />to fight other girls with shivs.
3788800 3791480 You're just mad<br />because I did this.
3791680 3794560 I... I... I got to be<br />with Isabel on my own.
3794760 3796020 Without you.
3796220 3797946 No, you never would<br />have talked to her without me,
3797970 3799320 ever.
3799520 3801040 I'm the one who made it<br />happen for you.
3801180 3805990 You know what's so funny<br />about this whole fucking thing,
3806190 3807320 all your little schemes,
3807520 3810370 all your,<br />"Oh, we'll have our year
3810570 3813660 and we'll fuck so many<br />girls," and whatever?
3813860 3818130 Is that you're the only one<br />who didn't do anything.
3818330 3820500 Yeah, well, that's 'cause<br />Brittany's straight, so...
3820700 3822170 Yeah, no, shit, she's straight.
3822370 3823720 Does it even matter?
3823920 3826930 Do you even care?<br />Do you actually like her?
3827130 3829390 Do you care about anyone<br />other than yourself?
3829590 3830810 Just find some other girl
3831010 3833120 to fucking jack off to<br />and do nothing about.
3839160 3840370 Cool. Yeah, I will.

4000620 4002160 Josie, what the hell?
4005500 4007620 Why... why... why you look<br />like a scared puppy?
4009710 4011200 Hey, Rhodes.
4011390 4012710 Do you have a minute to talk?
4013840 4015410 If you don't wanna<br />borrow firearms,
4015610 4017260 - then why are you here?<br />- Um...
4018140 4019410 Like, for advice?
4019610 4021410 I'm not your Gay Yoda, Josie.
4021610 4022770 You're too old for this shit.
4024120 4026130 Girl, when I was in high school,
4026330 4028800 people found out I was gay,<br />nobody wanted to be my friend.
4029000 4030090 And back then it was worse
4030290 4032970 because they hated you<br />just for being gay.
4033170 4035090 Not for being<br />gay and untalented.
4035290 4036970 Mmm.
4037170 4038850 Sorry, people didn't know<br />you were gay?
4039050 4040950 Girl, I wore a weave<br />back then, okay?
4041660 4042810 And I used to say,
4043010 4044190 "Hey, girl. Hey..."
4044390 4045600 Look, that's not the point.
4045800 4046800 You want some advice?
4046890 4048570 Invest in yourself,
4048770 4050530 teach people to fear you<br />instead of love you.
4050560 4053530 I don't wanna, like, deny<br />your advice, obviously.
4053730 4054860 I just, um...
4055060 4057200 PJ and I are actually<br />in a fight right now.
4057400 4058620 So, like...
4058820 4060370 Like, that's the advice<br />that I need.
4060570 4063580 I never had many friends,<br />and that's... that's sad.
4063780 4066000 And as I've gotten old<br />in this world,
4066200 4067810 it's just gotten more sad.
4069810 4071630 Okay, um...
4071830 4073510 I think I'm just gonna go<br />to the game
4073710 4075510 and then work it out<br />with PJ there.
4075710 4076710 I wouldn't do that.
4076880 4077880 Why not?
4078040 4079890 - It's with Huntington, right?<br />- Yeah.
4080090 4083090 Well, I'm guessing they've been fucking<br />people up for the past month, right?
4083220 4085600 - Yeah.<br />- So, they're violent.
4085800 4087236 What do you think's<br />gonna happen tonight?
4087260 4089040 I don't know. Football?
4090080 4092110 Game? Tackle?
4092310 4093340 Oh, girl.
4094710 4096910 There is a 50-year rivalry<br />going on.
4097110 4099010 They always fuck up<br />some unlucky player.
4100470 4101870 How you don't know...
4102070 4104710 In '77, they burned him<br />at a stake with his dog.
4104900 4107880 In '92, they drowned him<br />in a giant kiddie pool.
4108070 4111000 And in '03, they pulled<br />his body apart with horses.
4111200 4112380 It's called quartering.
4112580 4113920 I know... I know<br />what it's called.
4114120 4116050 So, tonight, I'm stayin' inside
4116250 4117590 and double boltin' those doors.
4122380 4124560 If you ever grab a...<br />Nah, I don't care.
4124760 4127690 I didn't understand a word<br />of that, I'm so sorry.

4132640 4136840 <i>♪ Everything went wrong<br />No matter what I did or said ♪</i>
4138090 4139530 <i>♪ Everyone I talk to... ♪</i>
4153810 4156610 Just go. Go, just, go.<br />I don't wanna go.
4158280 4159970 Oh, my God.
4160170 4162140 - Hey.<br />- How did you find me?
4162340 4164010 Why are you breathing so heavy?
4164210 4166600 Okay. I know we're not<br />in a great place right now...
4166800 4168980 Yeah, because I'm pissed.<br />I'm fuckin' pissed.
4169180 4171360 Okay, well, I just still think<br />we need to talk
4171550 4173270 about everything<br />that's, like, going on.
4173470 4175480 Yeah, cool, well,<br />I don't wanna hear it, so...
4175680 4177570 Okay, maybe you<br />should reconsider
4177770 4180160 because I saw Rhodes,<br />she says hi, by the way.
4180360 4182680 She said this Huntington shit's<br />way darker than we thought.
4182730 4185330 Apparently, every time<br />Huntington plays Rock bridge,
4185530 4187540 they try to kill a player<br />and his pets.
4187740 4188830 The pets?
4189030 4190830 It's bloodlust, man.<br />That's not the point.
4191030 4192080 Sounds like I should get
4192280 4193346 - the fuck out of here now. Okay?<br />- No.
4193370 4194630 PJ, seriously, come on.
4194830 4196266 We need to get<br />the club back together,
4196290 4198760 so we can save them.
4198960 4199960 What?
4201740 4204390 Sorry, you're saying<br />you want me and then you
4204590 4206930 and then all of the girls<br />that fuckin' hate us
4207130 4210140 to get together and save<br />some fucking football player,
4210340 4211560 who we hate?
4211760 4213270 Circle of bad vibes.
4213470 4215076 Okay, well, obviously, why<br />would you lay it out like that?
4215100 4216100 Because it sounds insane.
4216270 4217940 'Cause it is.<br />Why would we do that?
4218140 4221170 Because we made these girls<br />trust us and then we humiliated them.
4222670 4225700 They deserve a shot<br />at showing everybody
4225900 4227330 what they know,<br />what they learned,
4227530 4228890 how fucking cool they are.
4230060 4231720 Let's do this for the club.
4233060 4234060 What do you say?
4235310 4237250 Can we save the damn day?
4240150 4241510 Wow.
4241710 4242710 Pulling out the necklace
4242830 4244740 - in the final fuckin' hour.<br />- Well...
4247240 4248240 Yeah.
4250280 4252480 Mmm. Nice.
4252680 4255860 <i>Rock bridge, this is the<br />most important day of your life.</i>
4256060 4258940 <i>Forget your wedding,<br />forget your funeral,</i>
4259140 4260690 <i>fuck your bar mitzvah.</i>
4260890 4262610 <i>This is what matters.</i>

4265770 4268930 <i>- Let's go, Vikings!<br />- We're almost there.</i>
4270970 4275210 Okay, first off, PJ has<br />something to say to Hazel, so...
4275410 4278050 The apology. Do the apology.<br />Do the apology, instead.
4278240 4279670 Okay.
4279870 4282270 I'm sorry that I called<br />your mom a skank.
4284480 4287050 And I'm sorry
4287250 4290930 for saying that you have<br />no friends really loud
4291130 4292850 in front of all of your friends.
4293050 4296540 And I'm sorry for being<br />an asshole a lot of the time.
4297910 4300440 Most of the... All of the time.
4300640 4303950 And I do think that it's nice<br />you always take notes
4304150 4308380 and then you type them up<br />and email them to everyone...
4311260 4312760 and I really appreciate it.
4316350 4317350 Do you forgive me?
4319730 4321420 Yes.
4321620 4323186 I don't want to interrupt<br />this gorgeous moment
4323210 4324800 but we don't have time now
4325000 4327430 because I got information from<br />a very confidential source
4327630 4329100 that Huntington<br />is trying to kill
4329300 4330470 someone on this team tonight.
4330670 4331736 What are you even<br />talking about, Josie?
4331760 4332930 Nobody's even over there.
4333130 4334850 Oh, my God,<br />nobody is even over there.
4335050 4336600 Well, that is obviously<br />a red flag.
4336800 4339020 Are we not reading that<br />as a red flag? That's crazy.
4339220 4341150 - What?<br />- Please, Annie.
4341350 4342830 Even though<br />you're a Black Republican,
4342890 4345030 you are the smartest<br />out of all of us, okay?
4345230 4347206 I mean, obviously I know that.<br />You think I don't know that?
4347230 4349030 Then help us figure this out.
4349230 4351700 We need to stop the game.<br />We need to save them.
4351900 4354100 Wait, wait, hang on.<br />Hazel...
4355510 4356970 we need a distraction.

4376380 4377690 but the club needs you.
4377890 4379010 To what? Have sex with them?
4379140 4381230 Guys, we really,<br />really need you. We do.
4381430 4383030 In your fucking dreams, PJ.
4383220 4384790 Which you don't deserve to have.

4588640 4590070 Fuck, I'm thinking really quick.
4590260 4591996 What if it's in their mouths<br />and they're swishing it around
4592020 4593900 and then they're gonna<br />spit it out mid-game?
4594100 4595360 - What?<br />- I hate to say it,
4595560 4597036 but it might have something<br />to do with their semen.
4597060 4599410 Obviously, it does not.<br />What is wrong with you?
4599610 4600910 They kissed on the mouth.
4601110 4603290 - With tongue.<br />- As a distraction,
4603490 4605960 and we can do it again<br />if people are asking.
4606160 4607960 - Wait, when was this?<br />- The bomb didn't work,
4608160 4609560 and there was no<br />other distractions!
4609740 4611216 - Yeah, there was...<br />- And because we were...
4611240 4612960 - They're gonna spray the field.<br />- What?
4613160 4614840 - Okay, we're gonna have to run.<br />- - No!

4882180 4883180 Really proud of you.
4884420 4886040 I'm proud of us.
4890880 4892340 I do wanna say, um,
4893380 4895410 I feel like you killed that guy.
4895610 4897080 Oh, yeah. I mean, we killed...
4897280 4898280 I think we killed...
4898360 4900120 - You killed that guy...<br />- No.
4900320 4902880 - Yeah, he's dead. That's dead.<br />- No. Oh, my God.
4903080 4904560 Yeah, we killed a couple.<br />We killed...
4905350 4906420 we killed a lot of guys.
4906620 4908186 I... Let's just...<br />We'll process it later.
4908210 4909210 - Much later.<br />- Later.
4909330 4910740 - Yeah.<br />- Um...
4911820 4912900 Do you wanna...
4914160 4915200 Yeah.
4921620 4923820 I just wanna say I'm sorry.
4924010 4926400 You don't have to forgive me<br />at all or anything.
4926600 4930070 But I, like, really want<br />you to know how sorry I am.
4930270 4933280 I was kind of insane,
4933480 4936660 and the sheer amount<br />of lies I told is...
4936860 4938370 is shocking,
4938570 4939970 and it doesn't excuse<br />what I did.
4941100 4942810 But I really liked<br />getting to know you.
4944560 4948170 And I still really like you.
4948370 4950850 - I just...<br />- You know, you didn't have to start, like, a whole
4951440 4953030 fight club just to date me.
4954740 4958850 You could have just,<br />like, talked to me.
