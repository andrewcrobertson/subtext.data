28328 30130 Tonight is<br />the fucking night, okay?
30197 33467 We've looked like shit<br />for years, and we are developing.
33535 35435 I would say I'm actually<br />mostly developed.
35503 38806 We're finally hot.<br />At least, according to me.
38873 40173 We're getting out there.
40240 41809 We're getting in the cooch,<br />my girl.
41876 44579 We are getting in the puss<br />and we're gettin' wet.
44646 46113 Man, speak for yourself.
46179 48148 Nobody's gonna wanna<br />fuck me this year,
48215 50585 just like nobody wanted<br />to fuck me last year or the year before.
50652 53153 Okay, well, I'm gonna talk<br />to Brittany.
53220 54221 I think that it's time.
54288 55623 Oh, really? It's time?
55690 57592 There wasn't time<br />in the last 11 years
57659 59226 we've all been going<br />to school together?
59293 60628 I've been building tension.
60695 61963 You know,<br />you could say hi to Isabel.
62030 63096 Yeah, okay.
63163 64766 And just what would I say?
64832 68036 Like, "Hey, girl, what's up?<br />How's your boyfriend?
68101 70070 How's his penis?
70137 72707 Still awesome and big<br />and throbbing and, uh,like a male penis?"
72774 74474 They could have broken up,<br />you never know.
74542 76511 The fair is like<br />a completely fresh start.
76578 78846 I'm not doin' that<br />with Isabel, you know what I mean?
78913 82249 Like, I'm... I'm...<br />I'm playin' the long game with her, okay?
82316 84284 -Mmm.<br />-Here's how it's gonna<br />shake out.
84351 86486 I don't speak to the bitch<br />for years.
86554 89657 Bam! It's the 20th<br />high school reunion.
89724 91425 I show up,<br />I'm in a little suit
91491 93293 like the lesbian I am,<br />you know what I mean?
93360 94662 It's probably white, okay?
94729 97065 She looks at me,<br />I look back at her.
97130 99132 What the fuck happened to her?
99199 101569 She's washed up.
101636 103538 I mean Jeff has<br />run her ragged.
103605 106641 That's when my ass<br />swoops in, okay?
106708 110310 That made me so sad.<br />What? Okay.
110377 112046 Josie, tick-tock.
112112 113781 We're not gonna be sexy<br />little high schoolers forever.
113848 115750 Soon we're gonna be old hags<br />in college.
115817 118151 Do you wanna be the only<br />girl virgin at Sarah Lawrence?
118218 119419 Yeah, honestly, maybe.
119486 121388 I might have a good shot<br />that way.
121455 124424 I don't need this negative,<br />really sad attitude. Please.
125292 127227 What the fuck are you wearing?
128930 131264 It's really not too late<br />to turn around, you know?
131331 133101 I think you wanna be here.
133166 134736 Who said that?
134802 136671 -Where'd you get that idea?<br />-I'm just feeling...
136738 139172 You're getting nervous because<br />of how excited you are.
139239 141576 -No. No, no.<br />-Yeah, yeah.
141643 143477 Oh, and we're crossing.<br />And we're getting in there.
143544 145713 No, I can't, I'm sorry.<br />Ahhh! Fuck, my arm!
145780 147147 There's nothing wrong<br />with your arm.
147214 148816 You have Munchausen's.
148883 150384 Look, just follow my lead.
150450 151853 - Hello, ladies.<br />- Oh.
151919 153521 Oh.<br />You know what?
153588 155155 - Just keep going.<br />- How was your summer?
155222 156524 -Good to see you.<br />-Okay, you know what?
156591 158126 Uh, it's not gonna<br />happen, okay?
158191 159560 This school has such<br />a gay problem.
159627 162030 Okay, no.<br />No one hates us for being gay.
162096 165900 Everyone hates us for being<br />gay, untalented, and ugly.
165967 167835 Like, look at Matthieu.
167902 169469 Rock on, man. Killin' it.
169537 171706 I love what you're doing<br />with the school play.
171773 173741 Thanks, bitch.
174776 176711 -Fuck!<br />-Yeah.
176778 178311 Knocks it out of the park,<br />every year.
178378 180280 -Every show.<br />-Yeah.
180347 182750 Ooh. Popcorn.
182817 183885 Don't mind if I do.
195362 197598 -Hey, guys.<br />-Hi, Hazel.
197665 199867 Oh, hey, Hazel.<br />How was your summer?
199934 202036 Were you with your uncle<br />at the slop farm?
202103 204739 If you mean volunteering at<br />the National Meat Association,
205807 207108 yeah, it was good.
207175 208475 What are you guys doing here?
208543 209610 You guys never come<br />to the fair.
209677 211344 What happened to your arm?
211411 213246 Oh, my God,<br />she ate shit is what happened.
213313 214682 She ate literal shit?<br />What the fuck?
214749 216751 -Mmm.<br />-Or did you get beat up again?
216818 218519 No, I just tripped<br />and I--
218586 220521 Or were you jumped?<br />Was it spy camp?
220588 222456 Did you go to juvie?
222523 224257 - Yeah, we went to juvie.<br />- Ladies and gentlemen...
224324 226194 -Oh, my God, it was juvie?<br />-... it's time to get ready,
226259 229030 get wild, and get horny<br />for our very own Vikings!
229097 231099 Oh, my God, what did you do?
231165 233366 And the man<br />who will lead us to victory
233433 235435 against the evil, maniacal,
235503 237939 shit-eating<br />Huntington Ferrets,
238005 240273 let's hear it for Jeff!
240340 241809 Jeff! Have my babies!
241876 243578 Jeff,<br />fill me with your seed!
245546 247148 I just don't get why girls<br />like guys like that.
247215 249416 It's like they're like dogs,<br />or pigs, or is there a...
249483 251018 What's the grossest animal?
252319 253855 Jeff,<br />come sign my tits!
253921 256423 Eat my pussy!
258092 259026 That's right.
260862 262997 Oh, fuck. Uh, Hazel.
263064 265365 Gimme that.<br />Josie, take this. Take this.
265432 266768 - Take this.<br />- No.
266834 268368 Really quick.<br />This is the moment.
268435 270270 Stop yelling at me!
270337 271739 Could you give that back<br />really quickly?
272573 273674 -Hey, Brittany.<br />-PJ.
273741 276376 I am loving all the...
276443 278179 holes in your pants.
278246 279580 Thanks.
279647 281281 You look like<br />a little Dutch boy.
281348 282683 Thank you.
282750 284685 So, Britt...<br />Can I call you Britt?
284752 286687 I prefer if you just<br />called me my name.
286754 289289 - Britt-a-nay. Um, but...<br />- No, not that.
289356 291159 Brittany.
291225 292894 Are you thinking of riding<br />the Ferris wheel<br />at all tonight?
292960 294996 I wasn't. I'm going<br />on the puke and duke.
295062 296296 I need to pull trig.
296363 297497 -No, you don't.<br />-Yeah, I do.
297565 298666 I'm gonna say something crazy.
298733 302335 I think you could eat food,
302402 305006 digest it, let it marinate,<br />poop it out.
305072 306373 Mmm, gross.
306439 308242 Maybe this?<br />You want a bite of this?
308308 310044 - Oh, no.<br />- Yeah, this is fucking disgusting. Ugh.
310111 312146 You want a hot dog?<br />We could go get hot dogs.
312213 313614 Oh, I don't know.
313681 315249 Yeah, we could get the bun<br />and the ketchup.
315315 316984 -No bun. No.<br />-You gotta get the bun.
317051 318653 -Yes, you could.<br />-No.
318719 320888 No bun. Okay.
320955 322924 Um, Isabel.
322990 325358 Josie was just saying<br />something similar to me.
325425 326727 I don't think so.
326794 328229 I think so.<br />It was really good.
328296 329831 It was super funny.
333100 337437 You're just so--<br />You're skinny too, as well.
338739 340608 I'm Josie, by the way,<br />good evening.
340675 342409 Yeah, you're skinny--
342475 343978 You're real skinny minnie,<br />aren't ya?
344045 345913 You probably should eat.
345980 348115 They're gonna send you<br />to the hospital<br />with how skinny you are.
348182 350952 Uh-oh, call the doctor.<br />Skinny girl, I see.
352987 354522 Okay, do you guys want<br />any of our tickets?
354589 355890 Yeah, yeah. Thank you.
357258 360460 Fuck! Fuck!
360528 362462 I don't want to say it,<br />but we're fucked.
362530 363898 You know what? I'm good.
363965 366100 'Cause it's not gonna happen<br />for me.
366167 367735 If it's not happening here,
367802 370071 then it's definitely not<br />happening at Emerson, okay?
370137 372439 I'm done trying to sow<br />my damn oats.
372506 374508 -No.<br />-I'm packing up my vagina
374575 376177 and I'm fucking Matthieu.
376244 377545 That's the only hope for me.
377612 378980 -No.<br />-It's me and Matthieu, man.
379046 380815 And 'cause he's gay<br />and fearless,
380882 382350 he's probably gonna fuck me<br />without protection.
382415 383751 Then I'm gonna get pregnant.
383818 384986 We're going to have<br />to join a church.
385052 386087 He'll be the gay pastor.
386153 387555 My whole life's fucked!
387622 389357 And yeah, sure,<br />his sermons are good,
389422 390958 but everybody knows<br />he's fruity.
391025 393493 Everybody knows<br />he's fucking fruity!
393561 396063 By the way, our son, Hezekiah,<br />hates us
396130 398165 'cause he knows<br />we're both closeted,
398232 400134 but we try to make it<br />work for him,<br />but he's not happy.
400201 401636 And yeah, guess what?
401702 404338 The deacon's fucking<br />the evangelist, man!
404404 406641 He's fucking the evangelist!
406707 409577 I don't wanna<br />live like that.
409644 412445 Will you come and visit us<br />on Sundays?
412513 416150 Please, will you come<br />and visit us on Sundays?
416217 419120 - Isabel.<br />- Leave me alone!
419186 420588 -Stop following me.<br />-Wait, shut up.
420655 422023 -What?<br />-Look.
422089 423691 - Don't touch me.<br />- Isabel, baby.
423758 425326 My teeny, tiny baby girl.
425393 427161 Why do you always have<br />to flirt with other women?
427228 429563 It doesn't count<br />if they're not in high school.
429630 431065 Especially Mrs. Reilly!
431132 433034 -Josie, offer her a ride.<br />-I don't think so.
433100 434101 Yes, come on.
434168 435836 ...Irish Catholic.
435903 437672 And I'm regular Christian!
437738 439140 - Josie, ask her. Come on.<br />- PJ, stop.
439206 441008 You're hurting my head.
441075 443144 You're attacking me,<br />and it's giving me a migraine.
443210 444679 And it's giving me PTSD
444745 445780 about all the other times<br />I've had migraines.
445846 448015 -Just do it now.<br />-No.
448082 449216 -Just go fucking ask her.<br />-No. Isabel, would you<br />like a safety ride?
450184 451185 Isabel.
452553 453988 -Oh, no.<br />-Oh, my God.
454055 455389 Isabel...
455455 456791 Get out of the car.
456857 458392 You can't tell me what to do.
458458 459961 - Yeah, no, he can't.<br />- Okay,
460027 462997 I'm sorry that I looked<br />at Mrs. Reilly
463064 465299 and lightly grazed<br />her left tit, all right?
465366 467501 Move, you prick!
467568 469537 Uh, excuse me,<br />she said, "Move, prick."
469603 470938 Don't talk to me,<br />you ugly bitch, okay?
471005 473274 I do not talk to girls<br />in overalls.
473341 475676 -Hey.<br />-Okay, I might be ugly,<br />but these aren't overalls.
475743 478279 Isabel, get out<br />of the freaking car! Get out!
478346 479947 Get out! Come on.
480014 481382 -I feel like<br />we should just drive.<br />-Drive.
481449 482917 -Drive.<br />-Let's just go.
482984 484385 Please. You're being<br />really mean right now.
484452 485453 -He'll move.<br />-He's not moving.
485519 486821 He's gonna move.
486887 488656 - We're about to drive.<br />- Isabel.
488723 490257 - Drive. He'll move.<br />- Just drive. Josie, go.
490324 492326 -Three, two one...<br />-Pedal to the metal. Drive!
501469 503204 -Oh, my God!<br />-Oh, my God!
503270 504605 Jeff?
505606 507274 Jeff!
507341 508976 - Are you...<br />- Are you okay?
509043 510544 When people move cars,<br />don't people move?
510611 511846 Jeffrey, I'm coming!<br />I'm coming!
511912 513814 You're not alone.<br />You're not alone.
513881 515483 - Back up! Back up!<br />- We didn't even do anything.
515549 518753 No, come here.
518819 520121 - Man down! Man down!<br />- You!
520187 521622 Oh, my God.
521689 522957 -I'm... I'm blacking out.<br />-No, stay with me.
523024 524392 We should go. Let's go.
524458 525760 -Let's go.<br />-Yeah. Okay.
525826 527428 Let's just kind of<br />peel on out.
527495 528829 - Fine.<br />- What did you do to him?
528896 530765 Buckle it for me. Fuck!
530831 533234 You fucking cowards!
533300 534602 You better fucking run!
535469 536470 I don't understand.
536537 538105 What the fuck?
538172 541475 They're not gonna<br />get away with this!
544945 546580 Attention.
546647 548182 The library<br />is out of use again.
548249 550284 Huntington shot up<br />our remaining books,
550351 553854 so there will be no reading<br />again this year. Thank you.
553921 556791 Oh, Brittany was just so cute<br />last night.
556857 560928 Like, "No, I can't eat<br />a hot dog.
560995 563798 I know I won't even digest it.
563864 565132 I have to throw up."
565199 566967 And I was, like,<br />"You can have it."
567034 569270 She's like, "No, not, just...
569336 570938 Maybe, but not the bun."
571839 573941 Oh, it was just really sweet.
574642 575643 You had to be there.
575709 576944 I was there.
578045 579146 Are you serious?
579213 580681 I got "faggot number two"<br />this time?
580748 582416 You're the sidekick, not me.
582483 584452 'Sup, Ted? How's the family?
584519 586654 Sick. Yeah, you know<br />what to do.
587388 589356 Thanks.
589423 591560 Do you feel like people<br />are looking at us?<br />Like, more than usual?
591625 593294 I don't know.<br />Did you period yourself?
593360 595696 Mmm... Mmm-mmm. Hey, Sylvie.
596964 598232 Hi.
600401 602069 Holy shit. Are you guys okay?
602136 603538 What? Yeah.
603604 605172 - Why wouldn't we be okay?<br />- All right, kiddos.
605239 606941 Welcome back to class.
607007 608843 Hey! The prep club worked hard<br />on those.
608909 610144 That belongs to the school.
610211 612179 Oh, cool.<br />So, does your vagina.
612246 613681 Nice try, PJ,
613747 615316 but my vagina belongs<br />to the government.
615382 617485 All right, check it out.
617552 619019 -Today I got a special<br />lesson for all of you.<br />-Josie, so, how'd you do it?
620121 621122 Do what?
624125 625793 Holy shit. Is he okay?
625860 627294 Hey, you good, man?
629230 630898 What the fuck?
630965 632800 - Yeah, okay, so...<br />- What the fuck?
632867 633968 Meanwhile,<br />back at the ranch...
634034 635803 Okay, so, did he fight back?
635870 637404 No, literally, how did it go?<br />Did he fight back?
637471 638973 -I hope you broke a bone.<br />-If you need a shoulder
639039 641041 or anything,<br />just let me know...
641108 642743 I heard you did<br />something to him,<br />I just don't know what.
642810 644245 ...and I'll totally let you<br />lean on me.
644311 645913 No, but like honestly,<br />how did you do it?
645980 646847 Oh, my God.<br />Annie, they went to juvie.
646914 647982 That's how, okay?
648048 649750 Hey. Hey. Hey, you.
649817 651385 Overall bitch.
651452 653053 This is you.
653120 655222 God damn it, Jeff.
655289 656924 What the fuck?
656991 659193 Hey, you couldn't make<br />that analogy with your fists?
660761 662897 Hello,<br />this is Principal Meyers
662963 664832 with an important<br />Huntington update.
664899 666433 So, listen to this girl.
666500 669403 Last night,<br />outside the fair,
669470 671372 a Huntington player<br />followed me home,
671438 674408 pinned me against my car<br />and punched me in the face.
674475 677612 And now my face<br />is totally fucked.
677678 679980 Fuck.
680047 681882 We haven't faced the violence<br />of Huntington for 20 years.
681949 683417 They think they can get<br />in our heads
683484 685252 by picking on our weak<br />and defenseless.
685319 687154 Well, we can't let them<br />break our spirit, folks.
687221 688923 Keep your heads in the game.
688989 690224 They're gonna pork us!
690291 691892 -We're fucked!<br />-I'm screwed.
691959 693360 Hey. Hey, calm down<br />just a little bit.
693427 694728 Oh, great. More violence.
694795 695630 Just what this school needs.
697031 698432 Seriously, that's...<br />that's it?
698499 700434 - That's class?<br />- Latte.
700502 701503 Get my shit.
701570 703404 Solid class.
704738 706073 Hey.
707374 709843 Josie, right?
709910 713447 I heard you, like, beat up<br />my boyfriend last night?
714348 717251 Um, weren't you there?
717318 719253 I heard you guys ate<br />literal shit
719320 721722 - and killed girls in juvie.<br />- Really?
721789 724091 Um, what did you think<br />about that?
724158 725726 Excuse me.
725793 728295 Could the ugly,<br />untalented gays
728362 730464 please report<br />to the principal's office?
730532 732433 Guess that's you guys.
732499 734969 Hello, Principal Meyers.<br />First of all, I want to say,<br />God bless--
735035 736003 Shut up.<br />You know why you're here.
736070 737672 I don't, actually...
737738 739240 For committing a crime<br />against Jeff.
739306 741610 Our quarterback<br />and the most good-looking,
741676 744679 all-American, red-blooded,<br />muscular man<br />this town has ever seen.
744745 745746 Sir, please,<br />look in the mirror.
745813 747716 -Shush.<br />-Okay.
747781 751620 The homecoming game<br />with Huntington<br />is nearly a month away.
751686 753120 Do you know how long we've<br />been working toward this?
753187 754955 -Yes.<br />-Yes. It's everywhere.
755022 756156 - Twenty years.<br />- Couldn't be clearer.
756223 757424 I think I can explain.
757491 758993 I can explain.
759059 760729 Jeff is psychotic,<br />and he tried to murder us.
760794 762396 Ha! Sure.
762463 764699 You're all victims, and girls<br />are always right. Right?
764765 765966 Yeah, actually.
766033 768035 How come you can't buck up
768102 770605 and learn to protect yourselves<br />without running somebody over?
770672 773941 Maybe it's because we're small<br />and he's giant.
774008 776745 So, we needed to use<br />a little machinery.
776810 778546 Did you ever think<br />of that, sir?
778613 780515 -Can we just explain ourselves?<br />-Maybe I should buy a gun.
780582 782617 Okay. What? What?<br />Don't buy a gun.<br />Nobody said buy a gun.
782684 784818 -Can we just<br />calm down, everybody.<br />-Zip it.
784885 786420 -You know what?<br />-What?
786487 789023 -I'm gonna expel you both.<br />-No!
789089 790791 - No! No!<br />- Yes! Yes!
790858 794094 You have to understand that<br />this was a misunderstanding.
794161 797498 -Really?<br />-We were just practicing...
799300 800801 for...
805507 806508 for our self-defense club.
808876 810444 Self-defense-- What is that?
810512 813013 - Uh...<br />- Is it like a fight club?
813080 815049 -Well, here's the thing--<br />-Yes! Yes!
815115 817017 -Uh...<br />-Yes! Yes!
817084 818620 A fight club.
818687 820888 Where we fuckin' beat<br />each other up and shit.
820954 821955 -No, we don't.<br />-Yes.
822022 823490 No, we don't. Shut up.
823558 825125 Okay, you know what?<br />I don't care. Fuck it!
825192 826860 -I don't care.<br />-You're over it, okay.
826927 828362 Yeah. You can beat the shit<br />out of each other
828429 830565 while you perform<br />The Vagina Monologues.
830632 832767 Just stay in your lane<br />until you're munching beaver at Wesleyan.
832833 834803 Yes, sir.
834868 836904 I can't believe<br />they're letting you guys<br />start a fight club.
836970 839206 No, they're... they're not.<br />We are not.
839273 840809 What are you talking about?<br />We're gonna do it.
840874 841975 We're doing it.
842042 844044 PJ, I wasn't being serious.
844111 847281 Josie, did you see the way<br />that Isabel and Brittany<br />were looking at us?
847348 850117 - Also, you heard<br />the announcements.
850184 851318 Girls are terrified.
851385 853053 It's perfect. They need this.
853120 855557 Okay, no. They need,<br />like, mace, maybe.
855623 858926 We can't do that, okay?<br />We'd be misleading them.
858992 860127 Guys do that<br />all the time, okay?
860194 861495 That's the point of feminism.
861563 863130 That's not the point<br />of feminism.
863197 864532 You also don't care<br />about feminism.
864599 865899 Your favorite show<br />is Entourage.
865966 867635 You're missing the point!
867702 869336 I don't really think I am.<br />We don't know how to fight.
869403 871038 You guys probably<br />fought girls in juvie.
871105 872807 No, we were lying about that,<br />obviously.
872873 874375 About juvie?
874441 876076 - Yeah, I mean, what?<br />- Why would you lie to me?
876143 877612 You were the one who said<br />we went to juvie.
877679 879246 I just didn't correct you.
879313 881315 Listen, self-defense<br />is instinctual common sense.
881382 883417 You try to punch me<br />in the face,<br />I stop it from happening.
883484 885754 Whatever. I don't care.<br />It's easy.
885820 887955 Look, this is how we do this.
888021 889490 Okay, we start with Taekwondo.
889557 891058 Which I've got covered.
891125 892893 And then you guys can move<br />on to air punches.
892960 894261 Hub-bub-bub-bub.
894328 895630 Who do we know?<br />Who do we know?
895697 897030 I'll bring Stella-Rebecca.
897097 898533 You know Stella-Rebecca?
898600 900502 Stella-Rebecca who models<br />at car conventions
900568 902169 -in Chicago on the weekends?<br />-Yeah, we're family friends.
902236 904506 Okay, great.<br />Well, then bring her.
905640 907174 -Josie.<br />-What?
907241 908777 -We're doing this.<br />-No.
908843 910344 Yeah. Listen to me.
910411 912146 We teach a bunch of girls<br />how to defend themselves
912212 915149 against the evil,<br />Huntington killers.
915215 916885 They are grateful to us.
916950 919521 We build a community, we bond,
919587 921523 we share, we connect.
921589 924726 We're punching each other,<br />adrenaline is flowing.
924793 926393 Next thing you know,
926460 927995 Isabel and Brittany<br />are kissing us on the mouths.
928061 929463 - Jeffrey!<br />- Josie...
930297 932366 Isabel knew your name.
932433 934636 - Back from the dead.<br />- If we do this...
934702 936805 -Mmm-hmm.<br />-Very big "if,"
936871 938439 we just run the risk<br />of becoming
938506 940441 even bigger losers<br />than we already are right now.
940508 942544 And I hate to break it to you,<br />but we're pretty big losers.
942610 945012 And that is the beauty.<br />That is the beauty of this.
945078 947749 Because we are literally<br />at the bottom.
947816 949183 We're the lowest of the low.
949249 950718 -Okay.<br />-We have nowhere to go but up.
950785 953420 Listen, I think this is<br />a good idea, okay?
953487 956156 There's a serious lack<br />of female solidarity<br />at this school.
956223 958325 Not the point, Hazel.<br />Not the point.
958392 960728 Yeah, I mean,<br />we just felt like
960795 963665 there's a serious lack<br />of female solidarity<br />at this school.
964732 967569 Anyways, totally come by.<br />See you later.
968770 970572 What's your plan here?
970638 972206 I don't need a plan.
972272 974475 My mom has a business.<br />All we have to do is yell.
980615 981716 Okay.
981783 983116 What's up, lads?
984017 985385 What the fuck?
985452 987154 - These girls are ugly.<br />- Okay.
987221 988590 Where is Stella?
988656 990257 She was booked<br />for a car convention.
990324 991960 What? It's a Monday.
992025 993528 Um, maybe we should go
993595 994863 before someone cool shows up?
994929 996396 Before I die? Pick one.
996463 998999 Hey, Hazel.<br />Thanks for the invite.
999066 1000969 I love David Fincher.
1001034 1003403 - Oh, my God. Well...<br />- See?
1003470 1006406 I guess Sylvie's cute<br />if she lost her braces
1006473 1008075 and stopped huffing paint.
1008141 1009944 She'll never stop<br />huffing paint.
1010010 1011078 So, I thought<br />we'd start...
1011144 1012346 Um...
1013113 1014348 -Okay.<br />-Sorry.
1015148 1016684 All right.
1016751 1019554 Listen up,<br />you cunt-sucking<br />pieces of shit.
1019621 1021321 Welcome to our fucking<br />fight club.
1021388 1023190 Um, it's a self-defense club.
1023257 1024759 It's not really, "Fight."
1024826 1028128 So, as we know,<br />Huntington is on the prowl,
1028195 1029898 and they're picking<br />on the weak
1029964 1032432 and defenseless,<br />meaning all of you.
1032499 1035202 So, we're gonna teach you<br />how to not take shit.
1035269 1037337 We're gonna start<br />with dropkicks,
1037404 1039774 tackling, little bit<br />of knife play.
1039841 1041308 Then, punch-bucket,
1041375 1043310 which is when we throw you<br />in a bucket
1043377 1045279 and we punch you<br />until you bleed.
1045345 1049483 Before that,<br />perhaps stretches,<br />icebreakers, and trust falls.
1049551 1050852 Is that what happened<br />to you in juvie?
1050919 1052954 -Mmm. No. No.<br />-No.
1053021 1054822 Juvie was way crazier.
1054889 1057090 One time, this girl's<br />punching me in the rain.
1057157 1059192 Fall to my knees. It's muddy.
1059259 1061863 I get up. I'm blind.
1061930 1064599 Punch her right<br />in the middle of her face.
1065332 1066500 Broke her fuckin' nose.
1067434 1068235 Josie?
1068302 1069604 Care to share?
1071973 1073307 Yeah, all right.
1074709 1076143 Juvie was insane.
1076209 1079013 Once a girl tried to kill me<br />with rat poison,
1079079 1082382 so I took her outside<br />and I punched her<br />till she died.
1084184 1085687 So, you killed a girl?
1085753 1087387 Uh, no.
1087454 1090525 Because the ambulance came<br />and revived her
1090592 1092994 and we actually had a really<br />productive conversation
1093061 1094762 when she came back<br />to life, so...
1094829 1097832 Um, since Josie<br />literally killed a girl--
1097899 1099867 She came back to life.
1099934 1102202 Mmm. But I remember her<br />being dead<br />for at least a couple minutes.
1102269 1104204 Josie is gonna start<br />by showing you all
1104271 1106340 how to effectively throw<br />a solid punch.
1106406 1107875 Josie, if you'll step forward.
1108843 1110444 No, I don't wanna do that.
1110511 1112145 -What's the problem?<br />-There's no problem. I just...
1112212 1113615 No, I'm just not gonna do it.
1113681 1115516 Come on, they wanna see<br />the punch.
1115583 1117417 -They don't wanna see it.<br />-They wanna see. Look at them.
1117484 1118886 They wanna see the punch.
1118953 1119954 Who am I gonna punch?
1120021 1121254 Punch me. Just punch me.
1121321 1122991 -Punch you?<br />-Yeah, come on.
1123057 1124224 I can punch you.
1124291 1125492 Yeah. I know how<br />to take a punch.
1125560 1126995 Something people<br />would always say,
1127061 1128295 "PJ knows how<br />to take a punch."
1128362 1129329 Come on up.
1129396 1131699 Oh!
1132533 1133500 Oh, fuck!
1140608 1142275 Will there an advisor<br />for this club?
1142342 1143811 Because we'll be suspended<br />if there isn't.
1143878 1145713 Who is gonna be dumb enough<br />to endorse a club
1145780 1148148 where we punch each other<br />in the face?
1149182 1151919 The Holocaust. It happened.
1153054 1154822 Yes, it did.
1154889 1157357 But how? The seeds were sown<br />in the Treaty of Versailles,
1157424 1160494 which y'all are gonna reenact<br />while I do some little reading<br />over here.
1160561 1162664 I mean, he's perfect.
1163296 1164699 No.
1164766 1165933 -What?<br />-No.
1166000 1167802 Please.
1167869 1169904 -Dude, we're not fucking doing this.<br />-I broke your nose.
1169971 1171271 Yeah, and I've never<br />had so many girls<br />look at me in my life.
1171338 1172339 Fuck! When did you show up?
1172406 1174075 Hey, guys.
1174142 1176376 I just wanted to say thank you<br />so much for last night.
1176443 1179413 It was just so great,<br />and I was thinking,
1179479 1181348 like, if Huntington and me were<br />in an alleyway
1181415 1184351 and they were coming at me<br />with, like, swords<br />and, like, knives
1184418 1186386 and, like, guns and stuff,
1186453 1189356 and you taught me how<br />to punch like that,<br />then I wouldn't die.
1189423 1191959 -That's so great, Sylvie.<br />-Okay.
1192026 1193493 But, unfortunately,
1193561 1194929 Josie doesn't want<br />to do the club anymore.
1194996 1196764 What? Why?
1196831 1198032 I don't know.
1198099 1199466 Why? It was just<br />so empowering.
1199534 1201002 What was empowering?
1201069 1203671 Oh, my God, hi. Um...
1203738 1205873 Just, we have a fight club.<br />It was our fight club
1205940 1209177 for, um, female solidarity<br />at this school, which we lack.
1209242 1211813 Isabel, let's go.
1216249 1218653 Hi, boo-boo.
1218720 1220220 I'm so strong.
1223925 1224892 I mean...
1228930 1232299 Mr. G, G-man, G-dog.
1232365 1233901 Great class today.
1233968 1235903 Hey, uh, girl.
1235970 1237304 Thanks for coming in today.
1237370 1239540 We have to come in.<br />It's class.
1239607 1241743 Try telling<br />Dimitri Walker that.
1241809 1245179 Little motherfucker came<br />the first week<br />and I ain't seen him since.
1245245 1246647 Dimitri Walker<br />committed suicide
1246714 1248448 the first week of school,<br />Mr. G.
1248516 1250852 Sure, he did.
1250918 1255189 Anyways, um, we were wondering<br />if you wanted<br />to be our club advisor.
1255255 1257558 - What kind of club is that?<br />- It's a women's club.
1257625 1259694 We talk about women's issues.
1260460 1261629 For example,
1261696 1262830 periods,
1263497 1264899 declining egg count,
1264966 1266033 skirts...
1266100 1267400 Skirts?
1267467 1269937 But long ones.<br />Long denim skirts.
1270004 1273174 Feminism is what she's saying.<br />Feminism as a... as a whole.
1273241 1275442 Why don't you just ask<br />one of the female teachers?
1275510 1277111 Mmm. Thought about that,<br />but we hate them.
1277178 1278146 - Makes sense.<br />- Yeah.
1278212 1279714 Listen. I'm kind of,
1279781 1281916 you know,<br />retiling the bathroom.
1281983 1284652 - Mmm-hmm.<br />- Uh, I gotta be at the co-op.
1284719 1287855 And I'm also dealing with<br />some relationship drama, so...
1287922 1289791 Back to the club,
1289857 1291358 maybe this will be a great way<br />to take your mind off of stuff.
1291424 1292960 Can I be honest?<br />You're a man
1293027 1294662 who's not coping<br />with what's going on.
1294729 1296396 -Yeah.<br />-You know what?
1296463 1298933 My mom did say I need<br />to pick up a hobby.
1299000 1300400 And here's one thing
1300467 1301769 - my mom's always said to me.<br />- Mmm.
1301836 1304471 Sometimes, when you have<br />a new hobby,
1304539 1306040 -don't show up.<br />-Yeah.
1306107 1308242 It's, like, you can be<br />our club advisor,
1308308 1310377 -but you don't even<br />come to the dang club.<br />-No.
1310443 1312479 By the way,<br />great way to be an ally.
1312547 1313881 That's my favorite way<br />to be an ally.
1313948 1315817 You just say<br />you're doing something
1315883 1317985 and then you don't do<br />any of those things.
1318052 1319954 You know what I mean?<br />You say, "I support women." You don't.
1320021 1321589 Don't come. Yeah.
1321656 1325526 You know what? I'll sign off<br />on your period club.
1326194 1327327 -Amazing.<br />-What?
1327394 1328529 -Yeah.<br />-Really?
1328596 1329997 - Okay.<br />- So cool.
1335636 1337672 How many girls go<br />to this school, again?
1337738 1341474 Oh, my God, and again,<br />they're all sixes at best.
1341542 1342910 Hey, guys.
1344078 1346514 Mmm. Well, at least<br />Stella-Rebecca is here.
1346581 1349617 Are you stressed?<br />Because I'm stressed.
1349684 1351652 Hey, ladies.
1351719 1353955 Let's get it popping<br />in this motherfucker.
1354956 1356123 All right. Um...
1357325 1358559 Hello, everybody.
1359093 1360393 Okay, excuse me.
1360460 1361963 Sorry, I feel... Sorry.
1362029 1363197 Um...
1366499 1368569 Everybody, shut the fuck up!
1376344 1379080 This isn't a little<br />hangout, okay?
1380314 1383251 Oh, it's not a sleepover,<br />playtime.
1383317 1388022 There are serious rules<br />that we need<br />to establish, 'kay?
1389824 1390925 First...
1392159 1393094 listen.
1393561 1394795 Second,
1395630 1398599 be on time.
1399399 1400902 Yeah.
1400968 1402904 Except for you.<br />You come whenever you want.
1404404 1405806 What time is it?
1405873 1407642 - 3:30.<br />- 3:30!
1407708 1410578 Club starts at 3:15.
1411545 1413047 Not 3:16.
1413981 1416550 Not 3:17,
1416617 1421188 but the doors close at 3:15.
1421255 1423024 No exceptions.
1423858 1425927 I don't care if you're like...
1425993 1428428 - "Oh, but I had to go<br />to extra help for math
1428495 1432066 because I... I need<br />to get a full ride
1432133 1433801 because my mom<br />lives in a trailer
1433868 1435903 and she loves her boyfriend<br />more than me."
1435970 1438239 La, la, la. Blah, blah, blah.
1438306 1439807 Shut up, okay?
1439874 1443644 My dad left me,<br />and I'm incredibly punctual.
1450318 1452386 Um, hey, guys. Come on in.
1452452 1453955 Nice.
1454021 1455790 Uh, we're just getting<br />started here.
1455856 1457525 So, um...
1458893 1461095 Today I think we're gonna<br />start with some body contact.
1461162 1462697 We're gonna do wrestling.
1462763 1464932 I think I need a volunteer.
1464999 1466801 Brittany, you're close to me.<br />You wanna...
1466867 1468836 I'm sorry. I thought<br />we weren't allowed to be late.
1468903 1471138 -That's not true. It's about...<br />-Oh, that's about next week.
1471205 1472606 -Yeah, next week.<br />-So, the rules for next week.
1472673 1474208 Don't be late.
1474275 1475776 - But this week is good...<br />- Yeah. No worries.
1475843 1477378 ...if you're late.<br />Take it easy.
1477445 1478813 Okay, I'm sorry.<br />I just want to make sure.
1478879 1480480 This is a self-defense<br />class, right?
1480548 1481782 Where we can learn<br />to protect ourselves
1481849 1483651 against, like,<br />football players.
1483718 1485686 And Huntington? 'Cause, um,<br />they're gonna pork us.
1485753 1488022 They're gonna pork us.
1488089 1490291 I thought we were fighting<br />each other for money.
1490358 1491926 There's a cash prize, right?
1491993 1493594 I thought this was<br />to be part of, like,
1493661 1496097 a local underprivileged<br />female community.
1497798 1499767 My identity is completely<br />attached to hers,
1499834 1502470 so I just kind of go<br />wherever she goes.
1502536 1503604 Everyone's here<br />for a good reason.
1503671 1505339 So, uh, you know, like...
1505406 1508709 -Why are we nitpicking reasons?<br />-Yeah. How about this?
1508776 1510711 -Let's jump in. Right?<br />-Yeah. For sure.
1510778 1512246 - Love that.<br />- Yeah.
1512313 1514515 -I'll go.<br />-Great. Yeah.
1518152 1520955 Hey, hey, hey, hey. hey.
1521022 1522523 I don't know about this shit.
1522590 1524725 What the hell?<br />You didn't even warn me.
1524792 1526794 Okay, we didn't get<br />warnings at juvie.
1526861 1528229 - Look.<br />- We can take it slower.
1528295 1529697 - Okay.<br />- Maybe, yeah, try that.
1529764 1531565 Take that route.<br />Little slower.
1531632 1533801 Look. You just use<br />your natural instincts, just come at me.
1533868 1535202 Whatever you want, 'kay?
1536070 1537471 Oh, fuck.
1537538 1538939 Okay.
1539006 1541108 That's great.<br />I say that we go again.
1541175 1542843 - Oh!<br />- Ow, fuck! My back.
1542910 1544912 Oh, shit.<br />Man, we gotta shut this down.
1544979 1546714 We don't have to shut it down.<br />She's fine.
1546781 1548249 -Are you fine? Are you okay?<br />-Yeah, she's okay.
1548315 1550017 -She's totally fine.<br />-Shut this shit down.
1550084 1552019 - No, wait, Mr. G.<br />- Shut this shit down.
1552086 1553587 No, don't blow the whistle.<br />Don't blow the whistle.
1553654 1555489 I know that,
1555556 1558392 you know, this is<br />a little messy right now
1558459 1560428 but, like, the only way
1560494 1563964 that we can learn<br />how to defend ourselves<br />is by teaching each other.
1565433 1567034 Huntington is coming.
1569070 1570171 We need this.
1571572 1574575 I know that things<br />might seem scary,
1574642 1576944 but that's okay, because...
1578746 1580047 because...
1580114 1582850 Because you're gonna<br />be fucking pros.
1582917 1584585 -Is what I was gonna say. Yes.<br />-Yeah.
1584652 1585920 - Right?<br />- Yes.
1585986 1588122 Crystal, I'm thinking of you.
1588189 1591092 You are never gonna<br />get assaulted<br />on your birthday again.
1591158 1592993 -Lucky number seven, okay?<br />-Mmm-hmm.
1593060 1596531 And I... I'm gonna finally<br />reverse-stalk my stalker.
1596597 1598199 Yeah, absolutely.
1598265 1599568 And for me,
1599633 1601235 I'll be able<br />to kill my stepdad.
1602504 1603904 -Awesome.<br />-Okay.
1603971 1605673 And if you believe<br />in yourselves
1605739 1607074 and you believe in us<br />and then you trust us,
1607141 1609343 I'm like,<br />"Let's fucking do this!"
1609410 1610711 - Yeah!<br />- Yeah?
1610778 1613013 -Yeah.<br />-Yeah. Okay.
1613080 1614215 So good.
1614281 1616784 Yeah! Yes!
1616851 1618285 - Yeah!<br />- Yeah!
1619787 1623124 Yes! Yes, queen, slay!
1623190 1625226 Yes! Yes!
1625292 1628496 Slay! Yeah!
1631198 1632199 Cool.
1633267 1635202 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah. I'm just gonna go.
1635269 1636370 Yeah, for sure.
1646780 1648249 Oh!
1654955 1656690 -Whenever you want.<br />-I will.
1661228 1662830 Whoa!
1665600 1667401 -So, don't do that.<br />Don't do that.<br />-Don't do that, guys.
1667468 1668869 -That was not... Yeah.<br />-These things you don't do.
1668936 1670137 So, it's good to learn.
1670204 1671438 Yeah.
1677278 1679346 Yeah, no, we'll just do it.<br />What you should do.
1679413 1681015 - Yeah, yeah. For sure.<br />- Yeah, yeah.
1688222 1690659 -Wanna go again?<br />-Yeah, why not?
1690724 1692159 Whoa.
1693127 1694161 Good job.
1695963 1697731 - Yeah!<br />- Damn.
1717017 1719253 Come on!
1719320 1720321 Yes!
1732199 1734468 Yeah, okay!
1734536 1736538 Nice. All right!
1736605 1738272 Oh, my God! Yes!
1745513 1746814 Keep it up, guys!
1747948 1749483 Shake it off. Shake it off.<br />Get back up.
1759893 1762396 - Good work, guys.<br />- Yeah!
1762463 1764198 Fight me off, PJ.
1764265 1766233 Stop smiling,<br />I'm kicking your ass.
1771606 1772840 Hazel!
1798132 1799967 You little bitch,<br />it's actually working.
1800034 1801368 I told you.
1801435 1803170 I know. I feel like<br />if we keep it up,
1803237 1804938 we can actually take on<br />Huntington, you guys.
1805005 1807207 No, if we keep it up,<br />we can put our fingers
1807274 1809310 inside of each other. Grow up.
1809376 1810411 All right.
1810477 1812246 You know, PJ,
1812313 1813981 I feel like people<br />are actually liking<br />more than just
1814048 1815617 the hitting and the tackling<br />part of the club.
1815684 1817918 Yeah, I know.<br />We're empowering them. Duh.
1817985 1821088 No, I mean, seriously,<br />to have a safe space like this,
1821155 1822823 it means a lot to people,
1822890 1825092 and I think that if we took<br />some time to spend a meeting
1825159 1826894 and actually get<br />to know these girls,
1826960 1829296 like, it would be<br />really important,
1829363 1831865 instead of just, like,<br />sweating on them and...
1834636 1839173 Hazel, that is a genuinely<br />brilliant idea.
1839239 1840841 -Yeah.<br />-I love talking<br />about my trauma.
1840908 1845012 I literally jack off<br />after every single
1845079 1846581 -therapy session.<br />-What?
1846648 1849083 It just makes girls<br />weirdly horny. It does.
1849149 1850552 -Don't say "girls." It's you.<br />-Bonjour.
1850618 1852386 I just wanted to say
1852453 1854789 I'm loving what I'm hearing<br />about the club.
1854855 1856423 It seems so supportive<br />of women.
1857124 1858425 Especially the hot ones.
1858492 1860227 Yeah, well,<br />all women are hot to me.
1860294 1862296 Listen, it's really cute<br />and everything,
1862363 1867401 but we're getting<br />a little close to the game now<br />and, um...
1867468 1868902 I'm just a bit concerned
1868969 1870572 it might be taking away<br />attention from our team.
1870638 1875275 I think that's, like,<br />literally impossible to do.
1877378 1878379 Okay.
1881683 1884485 So, we know<br />that the club has been a place
1884552 1886521 where we can feel<br />empowered physically,
1886588 1889356 but we also thought<br />it could be
1889423 1892092 a safe space and a place<br />where we can open up
1892159 1893894 and talk about our feelings.
1895329 1897498 Okay, so who's been raped?
1898365 1899601 Just, you know,<br />raise your hand.
1901836 1903571 Gray area stuff counts too.
1909076 1911679 Everybody knows the situation<br />with my stepdad.
1913480 1918553 He's just obsessed<br />with Friday movie nights.
1918620 1922657 I mean, God, I get it,<br />you're my new stepdad, but...
1923457 1924458 fuck, whatever.
1924526 1925993 You know?
1926059 1928228 Every time I call the police<br />about my stalker,
1928295 1930397 they tell me to fill out<br />an online form.
1930464 1932867 And then the form<br />tells me to call,
1932933 1935904 So I call and then they say<br />they can't get involved until he tries to kill me.
1935969 1937471 And he keeps saying<br />he's going to...
1938205 1939339 but that doesn't count.
1939406 1941509 So, it's just, like, annoying.
1941576 1943043 Been there.
1943912 1945479 We've all been there.
1945547 1948015 Well, I've been assaulted,<br />like, a million times,
1948081 1950050 but I'm more annoyed
1950117 1954522 that everyone knows me<br />for being beautiful<br />and popular
1954589 1957559 and no one knows<br />that I'm actually smart<br />and super driven.
1957625 1961729 Like, I literally own a jewelry business<br />and no one talks about it!
1963464 1964699 See?
1964766 1967267 Well, ever since<br />my parents' divorce,
1967334 1970237 my mom has been doing this,<br />like, midlife crisis.
1970304 1972973 I don't know how that's really<br />sitting with me, you know?
1973040 1974709 It's been really, really dark.
1974776 1977077 This has just been really<br />meaningful to me to, like,
1977144 1981114 get to know some new people<br />who actually want to,<br />like, get to know me.
1981181 1984117 -I want to bring it back<br />to Brittany for one second.<br />-I can go next,
1984786 1986186 if that's okay.
1987822 1991759 I don't really like talking<br />about juvie
1991826 1994696 and everything that happened<br />this summer, um...
1994762 1998031 You know, obviously,<br />we get a lot of props<br />or whatever
1998098 1999601 'cause people think<br />it's so badass.
2000768 2003070 But, really wasn't.
2003136 2008008 I mean, unless you consider<br />getting hazed horrifically<br />every single night,
2008075 2010277 like, badass. I mean, um,
2010344 2013581 obviously, you know,<br />we had to survive the Tributes
2013648 2015650 and, you know,<br />I did have to, like,
2015717 2017685 fight people basically<br />every single night.
2017752 2020855 People were betting on us<br />and we were given, like,
2020922 2024626 shivs and rusty pocket knives<br />and splintered wood
2024692 2026694 and, um, pipes as well.
2026761 2029864 And, um, we had to just,<br />like, fight people,<br />sometimes to the death.
2029931 2032099 Um, and I still hear<br />their screams at night,
2032165 2035402 um, and that guilt probably will,<br />like, always shackle me forever.
2036804 2040307 I realize now, I don't have<br />to be that person anymore.
2040374 2043176 Like, I don't have<br />to just let things
2043243 2046648 happen to me<br />'cause of you guys.
2046714 2049851 And, um, I am,<br />like, really grateful
2049918 2052520 for what the club<br />has become and...
2052587 2054254 Um...
2054321 2056758 Just especially, you know,<br />from where we started<br />and, uh...
2058626 2060093 Yeah, sorry.
2060160 2061328 I feel like<br />I kinda killed the vibe.
2061395 2062797 I've never really,
2062864 2066066 I guess, said that<br />to anyone before. Sorry.
2066133 2067869 People wanna, like,<br />wrap up maybe or...
2067936 2069469 I'm going through a divorce.
2070538 2073373 Whoo! That shit felt<br />good to say.
2073440 2074976 Ooh, I'll tell y'all,
2075043 2077277 men... men need therapy.
2077979 2079814 Yeah.
2079881 2082717 I think that's a good place<br />to maybe wrap up.
2093061 2094294 -Hey.<br />-Hey.
2094963 2096163 Um...
2097230 2098833 Thank you, um, for that.
2101134 2102336 Um...
2103705 2106674 I don't know<br />what you're doing tomorrow,
2106741 2111178 but I was going to study<br />for Mr. G's women murdered<br />in history test,
2111244 2113681 if you wanna...
2117051 2118318 Yeah.
2119119 2120555 Yeah, okay, sure.
2124224 2125392 Mom?
2132132 2133534 Mom?
2137337 2138673 Oh, hi, honey.
2138740 2140608 What are you doing home<br />so early?
2145278 2146446 Uh...
2147115 2148415 Are you kidding me?
2149216 2152152 I had a long day.
2153320 2155188 Mrs. Callahan,<br />can I have a snack?
2157424 2158826 First club fundraiser.
2158893 2161763 I'm so excited.<br />Great turnout, right?
2161829 2164098 Hello, ladies.
2164164 2165833 Hi, Bill, Bob, Fred...
2165900 2167802 I don't know why anyone<br />wants my old, dirty underwear.
2167869 2169604 It's so weird.
2169671 2171973 Hey, Britt, uh, don't let 'em<br />touch in between your toes.
2172040 2173407 Thanks, PJ.
2173473 2174942 Ah. We're havin' fun.
2175009 2176711 We're selling panties.
2176778 2178913 You know, Brittany said she'd<br />make me a custom bracelet.
2180648 2181749 Very nice.
2181816 2183483 Do you wanna,<br />um, celebrate?
2183551 2184786 We could get some chicken<br />on a stick tonight.
2185787 2188823 Um, I can't. Uh...
2189991 2192392 Isabel and I have plans, so...
2193795 2195763 You're hanging out<br />with Isabel?
2195830 2197230 Yep.
2197297 2199167 Fuck, you're fast.<br />Oh, my God, okay.
2199232 2201035 I have to keep up.
2201102 2202436 Hazel, what is wrong?
2202503 2203604 Are you constipated<br />or something?
2203671 2205405 I'm fucking tired.
2205472 2207340 My mom was up all night<br />fucking the meathead.
2207407 2209309 What meathead?<br />Hi. Underwear, cars.
2209376 2210845 -Thanks.<br />-You know, like, the guy.
2210912 2212479 He's like the crybaby.
2214448 2215850 With the balls?
2215917 2218285 He catches them<br />and he... he throws them?
2219887 2221889 He's like the main guy.
2222990 2223991 Jeff?
2225193 2226661 Is your mom hooking up<br />with Jeff?
2226728 2228663 I just thought Jeff might be<br />her safe word.
2228730 2230397 Jeff is his name, you idiot.
2230464 2232499 Just get the hot people<br />confused, Jesus.
2234168 2235235 I'm good.
2235302 2237004 Looking good, Stella!
2238305 2239439 Are you gonna tell her?
2242176 2244645 Yeah, they said<br />they were in juvie this summer.
2244712 2247347 Okay, are you sure<br />they're not in the system?
2249050 2251284 But isn't every kid from<br />Rockbridge Falls sent there?
2251351 2252553 Hit me! Ow!
2253988 2256356 Okay, yeah, Essex County.<br />Any others?
2258291 2259459 Got it. Thank you.
2266968 2268035 Jeff!
2273841 2277310 No, yeah, but I thought<br />she was maybe dead.
2277377 2278913 -Not good.<br />-That's not the best.
2278980 2282150 -No. No, not great.<br />-That's not a great thing.
2288022 2289456 I wanted to...
2289524 2291993 I wanted to tell you<br />that, um, I'm...
2292059 2294327 I'm very glad<br />that I joined the club.
2295696 2296664 Me too.
2298431 2300802 I think it's really impressive
2300868 2303971 that you and PJ went through<br />everything that you did
2304038 2307542 and now have decided<br />to help the rest of us.
2307608 2310310 I mean even that story<br />you told the other day.
2311279 2313313 You're really, really brave.
2313380 2314849 No.
2314916 2316416 No. No, no.
2316483 2319654 Yes. I mean you almost<br />killed a girl.
2319720 2320655 You're...
2321656 2322790 Yeah, you're...
2323991 2325526 really, really brave.
2328896 2329831 What?
2334735 2336637 Actually, Isabel, uh...
2337672 2339406 -There's, um...<br />-Yeah?
2339472 2342043 There's something<br />you maybe should know.
2342109 2343476 Uh...
2345146 2347414 I mean it's pretty insane.
2347480 2349517 Okay.<br />What... what is it?
2351285 2352452 I just, I...
2355656 2357258 I heard Jeff<br />is cheating on you.
2361461 2363664 Wait...
2366634 2368069 Wait, what?
2368135 2371005 I... I... Sorry, I think I...<br />I heard...
2371072 2376077 Um, what? Um...<br />Who... who told you that?
2376143 2380982 Hazel told me that, uh,<br />he and Mrs. Callahan
2381048 2384752 are at it, pretty much,<br />like, every night,
2384819 2387454 like, constantly.
2387521 2391759 I mean, just at it<br />with each other,<br />which is pretty fucked up.
2391826 2394829 Um, even though I guess<br />it's, technically, it's legal,
2394896 2397031 it's still just<br />pretty nasty, uh...
2397098 2398733 Oh.
2409476 2411012 Thanks.
2412980 2415983 Jeff so hungy.<br />Hungy hungy, hungy.
2416050 2417484 Jeff so hungy.
2417551 2418853 Swoosh!
2423724 2425192 What the fuck is this?
2425259 2426193 Is there pineapple in this?
2427228 2428562 We talked about this, Janice.
2428629 2429997 Jeffrey's allergic<br />to pineapple.
2433301 2434434 Eat a bag of dicks.
2439941 2441842 Well, I wasn't going to do it,<br />but this is the last straw.
2446380 2447648 How was last night?
2453054 2456590 Uh, bad, probably,<br />I would say.
2456657 2457992 Wait, really?
2462730 2464932 She's walking really fast.
2467034 2468803 She usually walks<br />a lot slower.
2471272 2473441 Hi.
2473507 2475042 Are you having sex<br />with Mrs. Callahan?
2477445 2480014 Baby, you look so beautiful.
2480081 2482350 Like, so fucking hot.<br />How... how are you?
2482416 2484652 Bad. Are you having sex<br />with her?
2484719 2486587 I'm... I'm...
2487621 2489390 helping her with her taxes.
2489457 2490825 Aren't you<br />in eighth grade algebra?
2490891 2492760 I can't answer<br />that question
2492827 2494261 because I... I don't know<br />how to read.
2494328 2495495 She's asking you to your face!
2495563 2496931 Fuck, that usually works.
2496998 2500001 Are you cheating<br />on me again?
2500067 2502970 Baby, no! No!
2503037 2504705 No, why would...<br />why would I do--
2504772 2507174 That was one time<br />with your sister, just once,
2507241 2508743 two, four times.
2508809 2511145 No, I would never cheat<br />on you again, okay?
2511212 2514415 I promise you<br />I am not sleeping with her.
2514482 2515816 I literally saw you yesterday.
2515883 2517518 Shut up, nerd!<br />I fucked your mom!
2517585 2519787 Mmm. Mmm.
2520488 2521922 Wait.
2521989 2524458 - Yeah, we're done.<br />- Isabel...
2528229 2530097 I'm getting revenge.
2530164 2531665 I'm gonna fuck up<br />some football players.<br />And I'm buyin' a gun.
2531732 2533467 Hell yeah.<br />I'll get my stepdad's.
2533534 2535102 What about, like, egging?
2535169 2536737 Yeah, so we can make 'em<br />not refrigerated and smelly?
2536804 2538005 Ooh, we could cook 'em<br />and be like...
2538072 2539373 -"You're cooked."<br />-Yes. Yeah.
2539440 2540574 Or what about, like, a bomb?
2542443 2544678 Like a...<br />like a super small bomb.
2544745 2546113 I mean, they're super easy<br />to make,
2546180 2547848 and I can just put it<br />under his car,
2547915 2549216 and it can be a distraction.
2550818 2553821 Yeah, Hazel,<br />let's do terrorism.
2608809 2610244 Fuck you.
2611979 2613347 Sylvie,<br />you can't just throw it.
2613414 2615149 You have to fucking jump<br />with it.
2615216 2616750 - I'm trying.<br />- Okay, watch me. Just...
2622256 2625826 Damn, we're, uh...<br />We're really gonna scare them off.
2625893 2627628 Nice! Nice!
2627695 2630297 I think I'mma help Isabel<br />keep watch, so...
2631332 2633000 Okay, well,<br />don't get distracted,
2633067 2635970 'cause we could be fined,<br />like, $2 for this, so...
2639173 2640941 Thought you might want<br />some company.
2642843 2644812 -Thank you.<br />-Yeah.
2647381 2649350 It's nice everybody's here,<br />like...
2650351 2651318 vandalizing...
2652253 2653187 Jeff's house.
2656157 2657358 It is nice.
2659561 2660861 I, uh...
2661996 2663330 Like, how are you doing?
2664899 2666967 I mean,<br />I think it's for the best.
2667034 2671272 But I did kind of miss<br />when he would touch my hair
2671338 2673674 and go, like,
2674909 2678746 "Shiny, shiny, shiny."<br />You know?
2678812 2682416 I wanted to tell you<br />this before, but...
2683652 2685786 I really appreciated<br />you fighting
2685853 2688822 and speaking loudly<br />at my boyfriend.
2689524 2691125 I really value
2691192 2693928 when people use violence<br />and raise their voices for me.
2695729 2697965 It's actually one<br />of my love languages.
2699133 2700367 -Is the other one gifts?<br />-The other one is gifts.
2702236 2703771 Um, I know
2703837 2706774 everything is, like,<br />really fucked up and...
2708175 2711312 you still probably miss Jeff,<br />which I get,
2712179 2713615 but I just think
2713682 2717284 you deserve way better,<br />Isabel.
2720421 2722256 'Kay, guys.
2722323 2723857 Let's make sure we return<br />or donate these, okay?
2723924 2725926 Does anybody know<br />where the fuck Hazel is?
2728630 2731799 Like, 15 minutes?
2732800 2735436 Oh, fuck. Fuck! Fuck!
2735502 2737371 Okay. Um...
2746648 2748382 It's gonna blow!
2748449 2750851 Oh, wow, yeah,<br />it's gonna blow, guys.
2753555 2754822 Oh, my God.
2755389 2756323 What the fuck?
2756957 2758759 Holy shit.
2763063 2764898 Oh, fuck, there's no door!
2772473 2774208 - Annie, Annie, back up!<br />- -I'm going, I'm going!
2774275 2775677 Stop fucking yelling at me!
2775744 2776645 - I'm going!<br />- Fuck.
2782550 2784885 Oh, fuck!
2785986 2787121 Can you listen to me for,<br />like, once...
2787187 2789290 Ted! Ted-ay! Theodore!
2789356 2791792 You're awesome!<br />-No, you're awesome.
2791859 2793193 Great. What are we supposed<br />to do now?
2793260 2795563 Relax. No one knows it's us.
2795630 2796564 Hey, guys.
2797632 2798966 Great show last night.
2800034 2801402 I don't know what<br />you're talking about.
2801468 2803404 Oh, you don't.<br />No, it's really all good.
2803470 2806006 Jeffrey needed a new car,<br />anyway, so...
2807174 2808309 don't worry about it.
2812012 2813314 What's wrong, Josie?
2814683 2815916 You seem a little off.
2823157 2825893 Your club is over.
2826594 2827595 You understand?
2830632 2831899 Good.
2833033 2834435 All right, well,<br />some of us clearly
2834501 2836403 have a different definition<br />of egging,
2836470 2838839 but if we keep our mouths shut,<br />stay calm, we'll be fine.
2838906 2840374 They're gonna shut us down,<br />aren't they?
2840908 2842009 What?
2842076 2843877 No. We don't know that.
2843944 2845479 - What-- Why--<br />- Principal Meyers<br />will believe
2845547 2847081 whatever Jeff and Tim say.
2847147 2849049 I don't really see how<br />we recover from this.
2849950 2851251 Man...
2852219 2853253 Fuck.
2853320 2854855 You know,<br />it's been real, guys.
2854922 2856924 Okay, let's not jump<br />to conclusions
2856990 2859093 with the goodbyes and...
2859159 2861195 I'm gonna miss you guys<br />so much.
2862530 2864599 And like, at least<br />we went out with a bang.
2864666 2866433 I mean, that was<br />fucking insane!
2867901 2869403 There was just, like,<br />fire everywhere.
2869470 2871205 Wait. Stop.
2871271 2873440 We don't-- Wait, no,<br />we don't know that for sure.
2873508 2877512 PJ, don't be sad it's over.<br />Be happy it happened.
2877579 2880280 All right, can everyone<br />calm the fuck down, please?
2880347 2883250 The club is not over,<br />Josie, right?
2884552 2885520 No matter what,
2886387 2888288 this club has brought me<br />so much.
2888355 2889390 I feel...
2890457 2894529 so much more powerful<br />and, um...
2895462 2896430 protected.
2897364 2898800 Me too.
2898867 2900234 - Great.<br />- Oh, my God, PJ.
2900300 2901935 Okay, I'm sorry<br />that you didn't get
2902002 2903303 what you wanted<br />out of this group,
2903370 2904972 but I think<br />the rest of us did.
2905038 2906440 Oh. Good for fucking you,<br />Hazel.
2906508 2908909 I'm glad that you finally<br />wrote one email.
2908976 2910512 -Accomplished a lot.<br />-I actually did.
2910578 2912781 I practically ran this club<br />for you and Josie.
2912847 2914716 Hey, let's calm down, maybe.
2914783 2916818 You really think<br />that you're the reason<br />that we have this club?
2916885 2918318 The reason? No.
2918385 2920020 But I can tell everyone that<br />if you want.
2920087 2921723 Hazel. Uh, hey,<br />let's calm down, right?
2921790 2923625 You're really ungrateful.
2923691 2925426 You're so lucky that we even let you<br />be a part of this.
2925492 2927294 PJ, you're a liar.
2931498 2933835 Yeah, well,<br />you have no friends,
2933902 2936303 and a skank as a mom, so...
2950150 2951952 Hazel.
2961596 2962530 Pj...
2964364 2966133 This doesn't mean<br />it wasn't worth it.
2985520 2986588 Hazel.
2990123 2991425 Whoa.
2995195 2996396 I love God.
2997264 2998700 Yes, same.
3007775 3009376 Yeah.
3009443 3011646 Oh, my God,<br />I always wanted one of these.
3013280 3017084 But my mom says they hide your figure<br />and make you look ugly.
3017150 3019186 Um, you can borrow it<br />if you want.
3019253 3021288 Like, as a joke or...
3022155 3023423 whatever.
3023490 3024559 Thanks.
3024626 3025560 Yeah.
3032299 3034134 Wow, you and PJ
3034201 3036103 really have been<br />friends forever.
3036169 3039139 Oh, I mean,<br />since the first grade, so...
3040240 3042610 We had the same<br />babysitter, Rhodes.
3042677 3045713 PJ called her Gay Yoda,<br />but I think she's kind of like a mentor.
3049651 3052687 Yeah, but you guys, like,<br />could not be more different.
3053253 3054689 She's so, like...
3055990 3057124 like...
3057792 3059192 You know?
3059259 3060460 - Yeah.<br />- And you're...
3061228 3062429 You're so, like...
3069269 3071371 -You know what I mean?<br />-No, yeah, I know.
3075409 3076343 Josie...
3124391 3126694 I'm tryna help<br />your jewelry business grow.
3126761 3128730 - Really?<br />- Yeah.
3128796 3130430 I don't know if I can hire you<br />because you're like a convict.
3133935 3135202 Wow.
3135268 3139073 This is, um, a total shithole.
3144846 3146179 Kind of a mess. Sorry.
3149751 3152452 Well, I hear that<br />if you hire a convict,
3152520 3154154 they give you a tax break.
3157892 3159761 I fucking hate Mr. G.
3159827 3162195 Everything he says<br />is so pathetic.
3162262 3164364 Oh, yeah. I mean,
3164431 3166768 I feel like he, like,<br />jerks off to a poster
3166834 3169837 of the 1999 Rockbridge team<br />every single night, so...
3169904 3172272 Literally the peak<br />of his existence.
3182950 3185586 Like, what is the point<br />of this assignment?
3186621 3190858 Who is bell hooks<br />and why do we care?
3190925 3193628 Oh, sorry, I'm just trying to,<br />like, study over here.
3194494 3195830 Watch out.
3206107 3207307 What?
3208142 3210377 Uh, nothing, I'm just...
3211612 3214214 I'm just concerned<br />'cause I'm, like...
3214281 3219120 Your wrists are so small,<br />and the pen is so heavy<br />that I'm like,
3219187 3221455 -"Is she getting exhausted?"<br />-Mmm.
3221522 3223423 I'm surprised you can even see<br />what you're doing
3223490 3224726 with all the surface area
3224792 3225993 that yours are taking up.
3226994 3228361 Wow.
3228428 3229429 Must be a struggle<br />for you to write.
3229496 3231132 Okay, does this hurt?
3231199 3232900 Actually, yeah, that does hurt<br />my tiny, delicate wrists.
3232967 3234635 Yeah, that was<br />the lightest tap of all time.
3234702 3236504 -Can you feel that?<br />-Can't even feel that.
3236571 3238305 -Can't feel anything.<br />-Just like muscles in there.
3247081 3248015 Um...
3248750 3249684 Uh...
3251886 3254354 PJ, I'm... I'm straight.
3259660 3260595 Oh.
3263231 3264532 Um...
3267068 3269737 Yeah. Um...
3269804 3272840 -I'm... I'm sorry<br />if you misread anything.<br />-No, that's all...
3272907 3276010 It's all good. I shouldn't<br />have assumed anything.
3293060 3294796 Um...
3295797 3297464 I wanted to tell you something.
3298166 3299834 What?
3299901 3302804 Like, something that happened<br />last night.
3304304 3305640 What happened?
3307108 3308408 With Isabel.
3312445 3313681 Wait.
3317018 3317952 Wait, seriously?
3322657 3324592 That's... that's amazing.<br />That's...
3326928 3328596 Everybody,
3328663 3331098 -even the fucking losers...<br />-Even the fucking losers!
3331165 3333968 ...make some noise!
3338773 3340708 I thought you were<br />super Christian.
3340775 3343311 I know. I just like getting<br />caught up in the festivities.
3343376 3345345 All right, uh, so we're gonna<br />do the pep rally.
3345412 3347014 First up, cheerleaders.
3361162 3362663 Football!
3365166 3368002 Whoo! Yeah,<br />thank you, ladies. Ooh!
3368069 3370638 Thank you all for joining us<br />here today, folks.
3370705 3372673 There's been some
3372740 3375943 exciting stuff happening<br />at Rockbridge Falls recently.
3376010 3376944 Oh.
3377545 3379280 How many of you
3379347 3383416 know about that little girl<br />fight club that could?
3385353 3386787 Ay, there go my girls.
3386854 3390958 Well, do we have<br />a surprise for you.
3391025 3394394 We're gonna bring...<br />Where is she?
3394461 3396831 Hazel down.
3397732 3400034 One of the founding members.
3400101 3402502 To show us everything<br />the club's taught her
3402570 3405106 in a fun little challenge.
3406774 3409377 - Let's go, Hazel!<br />- Go, Hazel!
3409442 3412445 -What is this?<br />-I... I don't know.
3415049 3417885 Hazel will be<br />fighting Tucker,
3418719 3420688 the school's number one boxer.
3427561 3429730 Wait, I thought I was gonna be<br />fighting PJ?
3429797 3432733 I know what you're thinking,<br />but don't be alarmed.
3432800 3434568 Girls can do anything<br />guys can do, right?
3434635 3436070 Yeah, kick his ass!
3437571 3438706 Ready?
3439373 3440741 -Fuck.<br />-Go.
3455756 3457058 Oh, my God.
3460795 3462196 - You got this, Hazel.<br />- Come on, Hazel!
3462263 3463164 You got it.
3478612 3479880 Shit.
3481649 3483517 Whoo! Get him!
3496998 3498332 - The fuck are you doing?<br />-Is she, like,
3498399 3499533 sort of winning or...
3502603 3504638 No, leave the skin<br />on his face, will you?
3505539 3507541 Fuck.
3507608 3509010 Oh. Oh, my God.
3509076 3511212 I know what you're thinking.
3511278 3515549 You may be wondering<br />how a girl<br />under the training of...
3516350 3519320 of two juvie convicted killers
3519387 3523157 can't even stand up<br />for herself<br />against a regular old guy.
3524892 3527595 Well, truth is, they...
3530364 3531599 they didn't go to juvie.
3532933 3533734 No.
3536270 3537638 There's no record<br />of them there.
3539306 3540408 And according to Hazel...
3542877 3544311 ...they never fought<br />anyone at all.
3544378 3546113 And you know what else?
3546180 3550017 They didn't start the club<br />to empower women.
3551218 3554055 They did it<br />to fuck cheerleaders.
3557458 3559093 What is wrong with you?
3561530 3563264 It is such a shame.
3565199 3567635 We were really rooting<br />for you girls.
3569603 3571272 -Oh, my God.<br />-Oh, my God.
3571338 3572973 Okay.
3573040 3575609 - Thank you for attending...<br />- Hazel!
3575676 3577044 - ...today's pep rally.<br />Go Vikings! Fuck Huntington!<br />- Is she okay?
3577111 3578679 - Hazel!<br />- Whoo!
3578746 3580014 - Yes!<br />- Yes!
3588389 3589690 Is that true?
3590525 3591892 That's why you started this?
3591959 3594628 No, no, no.
3594695 3596397 Not... not entirely.
3596464 3597965 Not entire-- Okay.
3598032 3600968 Listen guys.<br />It doesn't matter...
3601035 3603871 the reason that we started<br />this, right? Like...
3604573 3606073 The point of the club
3606140 3609877 is that we all learn<br />from each other, right?
3609944 3612980 And... and we had a great time<br />doing it and...
3613047 3614715 I thought this club<br />was for sisterhood,
3614782 3616851 but it was for your own<br />selfish interests?
3616917 3618853 This is the second wave<br />all over again.
3624658 3625960 Isabel, please, please, wait.
3626026 3628530 PJ made me do this.<br />I didn't want to.
3628597 3629897 I would never want to do this.
3633167 3635035 You're pathetic, Josie.
3646615 3648149 Mr. G,<br />we're really sorry, we...
3648215 3649551 All right, look.
3649618 3651652 You know what?<br />I'm not a fuckin' idiot.
3651719 3653053 I just look like this.
3653120 3655322 I wasn't doin' this shit<br />as a distraction.
3655389 3658225 I actually was doin' this shit<br />'cause I actually liked<br />y'all group
3658292 3659727 and what y'all stood for.
3659793 3661962 -Wait, we can explain.<br />-I trusted you two
3662029 3664231 and y'all exploited<br />my solidarity.
3664298 3667101 I played the role<br />of an amazin' ally.
3667168 3668603 Is this about the time I said
3668669 3670905 Amelia Earhart<br />was a fake hero?
3671540 3673040 Because it's true.
3673107 3676443 Many a guy fly planes<br />without crashing,
3676511 3677778 but you never hear about them.
3678445 3680214 And then it's like,
3680281 3682082 "Oh, it's so hard<br />to be a girl."
3682149 3683817 "We, like, make less money."
3683884 3685853 "We had to lose<br />our last names."
3685920 3687522 "I love you."
3687589 3689456 "I want to be with you<br />for the rest of our lives."
3689524 3692893 "Oh, I love the mint green<br />backsplash in the kitchen."
3692960 3694428 And all of a sudden,
3694495 3696397 you leave me<br />for a motherfucker named Tony
3696463 3699133 and suddenly,<br />the fucking kitchen<br />is lime green.
3699200 3700334 I think...
3700401 3702703 Yeah, I think that moved<br />away from us.
3702770 3705306 Oh, you look confused,<br />like how I'm confused<br />right now,
3705372 3708108 on how you created<br />a fucking fight club<br />to get some cooch.
3708175 3711312 And for what? Y'all ain't even<br />know how to work that thing.
3711378 3713280 And I know y'all ain't<br />tickling the pearl,
3713347 3714982 you know what<br />I'm talking about?
3715049 3716250 You know what I mean?<br />Caressing the back
3716317 3718553 of that neck<br />and all type of--
3718620 3720821 Sorry, I just don't know<br />if you're supposed<br />to be talking to us like that.
3720888 3722489 Just, like, as a teacher...
3722557 3724358 Man, I knew women were evil.
3724425 3727294 Motherfuckers always<br />tellin' me like,<br />"No, that's not true."
3728295 3730331 But time and time again...
3735402 3737771 - Women ain't nothing<br />but the fuckin' devil.
3739039 3741008 I can't fuckin' believe Hazel.
3741075 3744411 Okay, well, you were pretty<br />horrible to her yesterday.
3745547 3750117 I'm sorry, what?<br />This is... this is my fault?
3750184 3753387 I'm not the one who put Isabel<br />on a rampage.
3753454 3755624 Sorry, what does that have<br />to do with anything?
3755690 3758292 If Isabel wasn't so desperate<br />to get revenge,
3758359 3760027 then we wouldn't have<br />blown up Jeff's car
3760094 3761996 and then he wouldn't be<br />so upset
3762062 3764131 and then whatever the fuck<br />just happened<br />would not have happened.
3764198 3767167 Okay, so all of the blame<br />just goes on me then?
3767234 3769638 Like, none of this can<br />be traced back to you at all?
3769704 3773073 Well, I mean, yeah,<br />it was your idea<br />to start the whole club.
3774208 3776645 I didn't want to do this<br />from the beginning.
3776711 3778713 You know that.
3778779 3781583 I just followed your lead<br />like an idiot.
3781650 3784451 You followed my lead when<br />you created that insane story
3784519 3788255 about girls betting on you<br />to fight other girls<br />with shivs.
3788322 3791158 You're just mad<br />because I did this.
3791225 3794428 I... I... I got to be<br />with Isabel on my own.
3794495 3796096 Without you.
3796163 3797599 No, you never would<br />have talked to her without me,
3797666 3799099 ever.
3799166 3801035 I'm the one who made it<br />happen for you.
3801101 3805774 You know what's so funny<br />about this whole<br />fucking thing,
3805839 3807041 all your little schemes,
3807107 3810077 all your,<br />"Oh, we'll have our year
3810144 3813314 and we'll fuck<br />so many girls,"<br />and whatever?
3813380 3817686 Is that you're the only one<br />who didn't do anything.
3817752 3820187 Yeah, well, that's 'cause<br />Brittany's straight, so...
3820254 3821922 Yeah, no, shit,<br />she's straight.
3821989 3823357 Does it even matter?
3823424 3826528 Do you even care?<br />Do you actually like her?
3826594 3829096 Do you care about anyone<br />other than yourself?
3829163 3830665 Just find some other girl
3830732 3833067 to fucking jack off to<br />and do nothing about.
3838872 3840274 Cool. Yeah, I will.
3844478 3845547 Pj.
3887622 3889289 -Ted?<br />-Mmm-mmm-mmm.
3890391 3891392 Ted.
3892761 3893961 Ted!
3896096 3897866 Ted!
4000067 4002135 Josie, what the hell?
4005172 4007509 Why... why... why you look<br />like a scared puppy?
4009343 4010979 Hey, Rhodes.
4011044 4012580 Do you have a minute to talk?
4013548 4015148 If you don't wanna<br />borrow firearms,
4015215 4017217 -then why are you here?<br />-Um...
4018085 4019219 Like, for advice?
4019286 4021154 I'm not your Gay Yoda, Josie.
4021221 4022557 You're too old for this shit.
4023858 4025760 Girl, when I was<br />in high school,
4025827 4028663 people found out I was gay,<br />nobody wanted to be my friend.
4028730 4030197 And back then it was worse
4030264 4032600 because they hated you<br />just for being gay.
4032667 4034903 Not for being<br />gay and untalented.
4034969 4036604 Mmm.
4036671 4038506 Sorry, people didn't know<br />you were gay?
4038573 4040775 Girl, I wore a weave<br />back then, okay?
4041609 4043110 And I used to say,
4043176 4044646 "Hey, girl. Hey..."
4044712 4045914 Look, that's not the point.
4045980 4046948 You want some advice?
4047015 4048448 Invest in yourself,
4048516 4050250 teach people to fear you<br />instead of love you.
4050317 4053253 I don't wanna, like, deny<br />your advice, obviously.
4053320 4054822 I just, um...
4054889 4056991 PJ and I are actually<br />in a fight right now.
4057057 4058425 So, like...
4058492 4060193 Like, that's the advice<br />that I need.
4060260 4063297 I never had many friends,<br />and that's... that's sad.
4063363 4065833 And as I've gotten old<br />in this world,
4065900 4067669 it's just gotten more sad.
4069637 4071338 Okay, um...
4071405 4073240 I think I'm just gonna go<br />to the game
4073307 4075242 and then work it out<br />with PJ there.
4075309 4076578 I wouldn't do that.
4076644 4078012 Why not?
4078078 4080213 -It's with Huntington, right?<br />-Yeah.
4080280 4082650 Well, I'm guessing<br />they've been fucking people up<br />for the past month, right?
4082717 4085319 -Yeah.<br />-So, they're violent.
4085385 4086888 What do you think's<br />gonna happen tonight?
4086955 4088856 I don't know. Football?
4089857 4091926 Game? Tackle?
4091993 4093293 Oh, girl.
4094361 4096564 There is a 50-year rivalry<br />going on.
4096631 4098833 They always fuck up<br />some unlucky player.
4100167 4101603 How you don't know--
4101669 4104404 In '77, they burned him<br />at a stake with his dog.
4104471 4107542 In '92, they drowned him<br />in a giant kiddie pool.
4107609 4110845 And in '03, they pulled<br />his body apart with horses.
4110912 4112145 It's called quartering.
4112212 4113581 I know... I know<br />what it's called.
4113648 4115683 So, tonight,<br />I'm stayin' inside
4115750 4117317 and double boltin'<br />those doors.
4121889 4124291 If you ever grab a--<br />Nah, I don't care.
4124358 4127327 I didn't understand a word<br />of that, I'm so sorry.
4153453 4156524 Just go. Go, just, go.<br />I don't wanna go.
4158026 4159661 Oh, my God.
4159727 4161963 -Hey.<br />-How did you find me?
4162030 4163665 Why are you breathing<br />so heavy?
4163731 4166333 Okay. I know we're not<br />in a great place right now--
4166400 4168636 Yeah, because I'm pissed.<br />I'm fuckin' pissed.
4168703 4171139 Okay, well, I just still think<br />we need to talk
4171204 4172874 about everything<br />that's, like, going on.
4172940 4175242 Yeah, cool, well,<br />I don't wanna hear it, so...
4175308 4177310 Okay, maybe you<br />should reconsider
4177377 4179781 because I saw Rhodes,<br />she says hi, by the way.
4179847 4182083 She said<br />this Huntington shit's<br />way darker than we thought.
4182150 4185119 Apparently,<br />every time Huntington<br />plays Rockbridge,
4185185 4187487 they try to kill a player<br />and his pets.
4187555 4188823 The pets?
4188890 4190725 It's bloodlust, man.<br />That's not the point.
4190792 4192325 Sounds like I should get
4192392 4193393 -the fuck out<br />of here now. Okay?<br />-No.
4193460 4194862 PJ, seriously, come on.
4194929 4196463 We need to get<br />the club back together,
4196531 4198666 so we can save them.
4198733 4199801 What?
4201401 4203971 Sorry, you're saying<br />you want me and then you
4204038 4206607 and then all of the girls<br />that fuckin' hate us
4206674 4209977 to get together and save<br />some fucking football player,
4210044 4211311 who we hate?
4211378 4213246 Circle of bad vibes.
4213313 4214782 Okay, well, obviously,<br />why would you<br />lay it out like that?
4214849 4216216 Because it sounds insane.
4216283 4218251 'Cause it is.<br />Why would we do that?
4218318 4220988 Because we made<br />these girls trust us<br />and then we humiliated them.
4222355 4225459 They deserve a shot<br />at showing everybody
4225526 4227128 what they know,<br />what they learned,
4227195 4228763 how fucking cool they are.
4229664 4231632 Let's do this for the club.
4232867 4233835 What do you say?
4234869 4236871 Can we save the damn day?
4239941 4241274 Wow.
4241341 4242643 Pulling out the necklace
4242710 4244645 -in the final fuckin' hour.<br />-Well...
4247014 4248015 Yeah.
4250051 4252220 Mmm. Nice.
4252285 4255556 Rockbridge,<br />this is the most<br />important day of your life.
4255623 4258626 Forget your wedding,<br />forget your funeral,
4258693 4260427 fuck your bar mitzvah.
4260494 4262362 This is what matters.
4262429 4265133 Gameday, let's do this!
4265199 4268803 - Let's go, Vikings!<br />- We're almost there.
4270605 4274842 Okay, first off,<br />PJ has something<br />to say to Hazel, so...
4274909 4277912 The apology. Do the apology.<br />Do the apology, instead.
4277979 4279412 Okay.
4279479 4282282 I'm sorry that I called<br />your mom a skank.
4284218 4286721 And I'm sorry
4286788 4290625 for saying that you have<br />no friends really loud
4290691 4292693 in front of all<br />of your friends.
4292760 4296496 And I'm sorry<br />for being an asshole<br />a lot of the time.
4297565 4300034 Most of the--<br />All of the time.
4300101 4303638 And I do think that it's nice<br />you always take notes
4303704 4308375 and then you type them up<br />and email them to everyone...
4311045 4312680 and I really appreciate it.
4316117 4317051 Do you forgive me?
4319419 4321155 Yes.
4321222 4322690 I don't want<br />to interrupt this<br />gorgeous moment
4322757 4324659 but we don't have time now
4324725 4327228 because I got information from<br />a very confidential source
4327295 4328763 that Huntington<br />is trying to kill
4328830 4330397 someone on this team tonight.
4330463 4331464 What are you even<br />talking about, Josie?
4331532 4333067 Nobody's even over there.
4333134 4334702 Oh, my God,<br />nobody is even over there.
4334769 4336604 Well, that is obviously<br />a red flag.
4336671 4338706 Are we not reading that<br />as a red flag? That's crazy.
4338773 4340808 - What?<br />- Please, Annie.
4340875 4342577 Even though<br />you're a Black Republican,
4342643 4344712 you are the smartest<br />out of all of us, okay?
4344779 4346714 I mean, obviously I know that.<br />You think I don't know that?
4346781 4348716 Then help us<br />figure this out.
4348783 4351451 We need to stop the game.<br />We need to save them.
4351519 4353955 Wait, wait, hang on.<br />Hazel...
4355256 4356858 we need a distraction.
4359492 4360995 Oh, now you want a bomb.
4362330 4363331 Oh, fuck.
4363396 4364464 So sorry. Okay. Fuck.
4372306 4373774 Isabel.
4373841 4376043 I know you really must<br />hate me right now,
4376110 4377444 but the club needs you.
4377511 4378880 To what? Have sex with them?
4378946 4381082 Guys, we really,<br />really need you. We do.
4381148 4382717 In your fucking dreams, PJ.
4382783 4384719 Which you don't deserve<br />to have.
4385353 4387321 When you sleep,
4387387 4388522 - it should be, like...<br />- -Rockbridge, are you ready?
4388589 4390091 ...total darkness.
4390157 4391826 -Oh, fuck.<br />-Wow, okay.
4391893 4393393 Okay, wait, seriously,
4393460 4394762 maybe if you<br />just listened to us.
4394829 4396764 -Just listen to us. Whoa!<br />-Brittany.
4396831 4398498 Here comes your team!<br />- Isabel.
4398566 4400801 I wouldn't be asking you<br />if this wasn't important!
4400868 4402469 We don't have time<br />for this.
4402536 4404205 - Josie, come on.<br />- Hazel!
4404272 4405907 - Okay, now that you're all...<br />- Ugh. Uh...
4405973 4407275 ...warmed up,<br />I want you guys...
4407341 4408408 Is it the red wire?
4408475 4410511 Shit, or is it the yellow?
4410578 4412213 ...Shawshank your way out.
4412280 4413948 -Put your hands together...<br />-You got this, Jeff.
4414015 4415216 -...and shake your tanks.<br />-You got it!
4415283 4417852 Hazel! It's starting!
4418753 4420588 Jeff!
4420655 4422757 Jeff! Eat my pussy!
4422823 4424125 Come on, come on!
4425559 4426827 Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!
4426894 4429230 -Hurry, Hazel!<br />-It's gonna blow.
4430765 4432199 - Hazel, come on!<br />- Hazel!
4432266 4433567 Hazel, come on!
4438706 4440675 -Hazel, it's not working.<br />-Hazel, it's not going.
4440741 4442310 - Oh, no.<br />- Fuck. Fucking...
4442376 4443544 - Maybe turn it off...<br />- Maybe hit it?
4443611 4444812 No. Give me space. Stop.
4444879 4446013 Turn it off<br />and then back on.
4446414 4447515 Jeff!
4449383 4453354 - I want you to rub<br />Vicks VapoRub on your tanks
4453421 4456857 and dance around<br />like the fruitbats<br />that you are!
4456924 4459994 Okay, plan B. We need to get<br />the cheerleaders to make out.
4460061 4461829 Wait, okay, which cheerleaders<br />do you think?
4461896 4464098 It's a distraction.<br />We need a distraction.
4471238 4472540 -Guys.<br />-Hey, guys.
4472606 4473975 Guys, kiss each other.
4474041 4475576 Make out.<br />Make out with each other!
4475643 4476777 We need<br />to delay the game.
4478079 4481015 Guys! Make out<br />with each other!
4485519 4488589 Everyone,<br />get your guns out,<br />hide your children
4488656 4491625 because here comes Huntington.
4498165 4500067 - Fuck you! Bitch!<br />- What the frick is up?
4500134 4502169 -Yeah! Get back!<br />-Yeah! Wake up, pussy!
4502236 4503671 Hold me back!
4503738 4505773 You're so lucky!<br />You're so fucking lucky.
4505840 4508376 Hazel! Hazel! Hazel!
4508442 4509710 What do we do?
4511645 4513481 Look, look, look.
4529697 4532033 Oh, wait. I'm gay.
4534368 4536037 Okay, yeah, I'm not.
4536904 4538906 I just like gay porn.
4538973 4540941 This is nothing<br />like porn at all.
4542910 4544011 Wait.
4545212 4546614 Is porn even real?
4558527 4562730 Can we cut the gay shit<br />and get this show on the road?
4562797 4567902 I came here for some good<br />man-on-man grappling<br />and slapping football!
4567968 4570671 Can everybody<br />stop looking<br />at the dyke parade?
4570738 4575576 Who do I have to blow<br />to get this game<br />started already?
4575643 4579146 -Yes!<br />-Now make 'em eat<br />a bag of urine cakes.
4579213 4581849 Look, I found empty<br />barrels of pineapple juice.
4581916 4583951 There is pineapple here.
4584018 4586020 So, they're gonna<br />poison Jeff then.
4586720 4588122 Where the fuck is it?
4588189 4590124 Fuck, I'm thinking<br />really quick.
4590191 4591892 What if it's in their mouths<br />and they're swishing it around
4591959 4593661 and then they're gonna<br />spit it out mid-game?
4593727 4595362 - What?<br />- I hate to say it,
4595429 4597331 but it might have something<br />to do with their semen.
4597398 4599266 Obviously, it does not.<br />What is wrong with you?
4599333 4600734 They kissed on the mouth.
4600801 4602970 - With tongue.<br />- As a distraction,
4603037 4605507 and we can do it again<br />if people are asking.
4605574 4607708 - Wait, when was this?<br />- The bomb didn't work,
4607775 4609477 and there was no<br />other distractions!
4609544 4611412 - Yeah, there was...<br />- And because we were...
4611479 4613347 - They're gonna spray the field.<br />- What?
4613414 4615517 - Okay, we're gonna have to run.<br />- -No!
4615584 4616984 -We're gonna have to run.<br />We're gonna have to run.<br />-We can't run. No!
4617051 4618085 No!
4618152 4619620 -Oh, my asthma.<br />-No, please!
4619687 4620821 You don't have asthma.
4620888 4622623 I feel like I have asthma now!
4625326 4627394 PJ!<br />Cover the sprinklers.
4627461 4628696 I got it.

4827494 4829063 - Turn it off! Turn it off!<br />- 'Scuse me.
4829129 4831865 Turn it off!<br />Please just turn it off!

4890658 4892259 I do wanna say, um,
4893293 4895129 I feel like<br />you killed that guy.
4895195 4896865 Oh, yeah. I mean, we killed--
4896930 4898165 I think we killed...
4898232 4899701 -You killed that guy...<br />-No.
4899768 4902503 -Yeah, he's dead. That's dead.<br />-No. Oh, my God.
4902570 4904438 Yeah, we killed a couple.<br />We killed...
4905105 4906473 we killed a lot of guys.
4906541 4907842 I-- Let's just--<br />We'll process it later.
4907908 4908909 -Much later.<br />-Later.
4908976 4910578 -Yeah.<br />-Um...

4921255 4923457 I just wanna say I'm sorry.
4923525 4925926 You don't have to forgive me<br />at all or anything.
4925993 4929864 But I, like, really want<br />you to know<br />how sorry I am.
4929930 4933033 I was kind of insane,
4933100 4936538 and the sheer amount<br />of lies I told is...
4936604 4938105 is shocking,
4938172 4939973 and it doesn't excuse<br />what I did.
4941108 4942644 But I really liked<br />getting to know you.
4944211 4947749 And I still really like you.
4947816 4950284 -I just...<br />-You know, you didn't have<br />to start, like, a whole
4951118 4953020 fight club just to date me.
4954354 4958492 You could have just,<br />like, talked to me.
4958560 4961128 Oh. Okay, uh,<br />I don't really know
4961195 4963631 how true that is.<br />You know what I mean...
4976711 4978345 Man, I knew women were good.
4978412 4981081 I been sayin' that shit<br />the whole time, man.

5001368 5002937 It seems like<br />these Huntington players
5003003 5004104 -are not only shitty...<br />-Yes, queen!
5004171 5005673 ...football players,
5005740 5008776 but they're also dead cheating<br />bitch asses.

5068135 5070738 You got suspenders<br />over your nipples<br />like a goddamn freak.
5078312 5079847 Not gonna come<br />to any meetings.

5081315 5082584 He's so preoccupied<br />with his divor...
5083417 5085152 Yeah.
5085218 5086921 I drank before I came<br />to class.
5086988 5088590 -What?<br />-Sorry.

5099968 5101168 -Good shit.<br />-I got this.
5123190 5126360 Y'all were two of my top<br />students, I think.
5126426 5127862 Oh, no, that was<br />two other students.
5127929 5129597 But at the end of the day,<br />it don't matter.
5129664 5132700 This shit is, like, beyond me.
5134501 5136470 Not Beyond Meat,<br />like the fake meat,
5136537 5138438 but beyond me, like...
