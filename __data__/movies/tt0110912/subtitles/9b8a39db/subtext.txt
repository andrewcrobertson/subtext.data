29321 31073 Forget it. It's too risky.
31990 33408 I'm through doing that shit.
33492 35953 You always say that,<br />the same thing every time.
36036 38789 "I'm through, never again, too dangerous.“
38872 41041 I know that's what I always say.<br />I'm always right, too.
41124 43377 But you forget about it in a day or two.
43460 45230 Yeah, well,<br />the days of me forgetting are over,
45254 47214 and the days of me remembering<br />have just begun.
47297 49359 You know when you go on like this<br />what you sound like?
49383 51819 I sound like a sensible fucking man,<br />that's what I sound like.
51843 53683 You sound like a duck.
53720 55823 Take heart, cause you're never<br />gonna have to hear it again,
55847 58743 'cause since I'm never gonna do it again,<br />you're never gonna have to hear me quack
58767 61144 - about how I'm never gonna do it again.<br />- After tonight.
61228 63772 Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
64481 65857 Can I get anyone more coffee?
65941 67901 Oh, yes.
69027 70237 Thank you.
70320 71697 You're welcome.
73115 74616 I mean, the way it is now,
74700 76700 you're taking the same risk<br />as when you Rob a bank.
77703 79663 Taking more of a risk. Banks are easier.
79746 82708 Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you<br />in any way during a robbery.
82791 84751 They're insured.<br />Why should they give a fuck?
84835 87254 You don't even need a gun<br />in a federal bank.
87337 90841 I heard about this one bloke, he walks<br />into a bank with a portable phone.
90924 92259 He gives the phone to the teller,
92342 95154 bloke on the other end of the phone says,<br />"we got this guy's little girl.
95178 97532 If you don't give him all your money,<br />we're gonna kill her."
97556 99349 - Did it work?<br />- Fucking right, it worked.
99433 103145 That's what I'm talking about. Knucklehead<br />walks into a bank with a telephone.
103228 106356 Not a pistol, not a shotgun,<br />a fucking phone.
106440 108984 Cleans the place out.<br />They don't even lift a fucking finger.
109067 110777 Did they hurt the little girl?
110861 113381 I don't know. There probably never was<br />a little girl in the first place.
113405 115008 The point of the story<br />isn't the little girl.
115032 116072 The point of the story is,
116116 117876 - they robbed a bank with a telephone.<br />- Hmm.
118368 120680 - You want to Rob banks?<br />- I'm not saying I want to Rob banks.
120704 123391 I'm just illustrating if we did,<br />it'd be easier than what we been doing.
123415 124750 And no more liquor stores?
124833 127586 What we been talking about?<br />Yeah, no more liquor stores.
127669 129272 Besides, it ain't<br />the giggle it used to be.
129296 130940 There's too many foreigners<br />own liquor stores.
130964 133067 Vietnamese, Koreans,<br />they don't even speak fucking English.
133091 135945 Tell 'em, "empty out the register,"<br />they don't know what you're talking about.
135969 137179 They make it too personal.
137262 139616 We keep on, one of these gook fucker's<br />gonna make us kill him.
139640 141058 I'm not gonna kill anybody.
141141 142684 I don't want to kill anybody, either.
142768 145479 But they'll probably put us in a situation<br />where it's us or them.
146229 147269 And if it's not the gooks,
147314 150609 it's these old fucking Jews who've owned<br />the store for 15 fucking generations.
150692 153320 You got grandpa Irving<br />sitting behind the counter
153403 154780 with a fucking Magnum in his hand.
154863 157133 Try walking into one of those places<br />with nothing but a phone,
157157 159594 see how far that gets you.<br />Fuck it. Forget it. We're out of it.
159618 161495 Yeah, well, what then? Day jobs?
162120 164039 - Not in this life.<br />- What, then?
165999 167668 Garcon, coffee!
168418 169419 This place.
172089 173757 "Garcon“ means “boy."
177219 179554 This place?
179638 181264 A coffee shop?
181348 182683 What's wrong with that?
184351 186311 Nobody ever robs restaurants.
186978 188021 Why not?
189022 192442 Bars, liquor stores, gas stations.
192526 195195 You'll get your head blown off<br />sticking up one of them.
195278 197030 Restaurants, on the other hand,
197114 198824 you catch with their pants down.
198907 200867 They're not expecting to get robbed.
200951 202244 Not as expecting, anyway.
202327 206248 I bet you could cut down<br />on the hero factor in a place like this.
206331 207332 Correct.
207416 210627 Same as banks, these places are insured.
210711 213046 Manager. He don't give a fuck.
213130 216192 He's just trying to get you out the door<br />before you start plugging the diners.
216216 217759 Waitresses? Fucking forget it.
217843 220095 No way they're taking a bullet<br />for the register.
220178 223181 Busboys, some wetback<br />getting paid $1.50 an hour,
223265 225642 really give a fuck<br />you're stealing from the owner?
225726 227578 Customers sitting there<br />with food in their mouths,
227602 228871 they don't know what's going on.
228895 230540 One minute they're having a Denver omelet,
230564 232774 next minute someone's sticking<br />a gun in their face.
233608 236153 See, I got the idea
236236 238447 last liquor store we stuck up. Remember?
238530 239948 All the customers kept coming in?
240031 241450 Yeah.
241533 244202 - You got the idea taking their wallets.<br />- Mm-hmm.
244286 246079 - Now, that was a good idea.<br />- Thank you.
246163 248349 Made more from the wallets<br />than we did from the register.
248373 249624 Yes, we did.
249708 251228 A lot of people come into restaurants.
251293 252878 A lot of wallets.
253628 254921 Pretty smart, huh?
255964 257048 Pretty smart.
259301 261595 I'm ready. Let's do it.<br />Right now, right here.
261678 262846 Come on.
262929 263972 All right.
264848 266183 Same as last time, remember?
266266 269978 - You're crowd control. I handle employees.<br />- Mm-hmm.
274691 276109 I love you, pumpkin.
276193 277736 I love you, honey bunny.
279112 281114 Everybody, be cool! This is a robbery!
281198 284451 Any of you fucking pricks move,
284534 288371 and I'll execute<br />every motherfucking last one of you!
399816 401318 J” jungle boogie j”
402068 403445 j” jungle boogie j”
403528 404529 j” get it on j”
404613 405739 j” jungle boogie j”
406656 408909 -j” jungle boogie j”<br />-j” gel if on j”
408992 411244 -j” jungle boogie j”<br />-j” get up with the boogie j”

415790 418251 -j” jungle boogie j”<br />-j” come and shake it around j”
425634 428219 Okay, so tell me again<br />about the hash bars.
428303 429554 Okay. What you want to know?
429638 430847 Hash is legal there, right?
430931 432766 Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.
432849 437062 You just can't walk into a restaurant,<br />roll a joint, and start puffing away.
437145 440315 I mean, they want you to smoke in<br />your home or certain designated places.
440398 443401 - And those are hash bars?<br />- Yeah, it breaks down like this, okay?
443485 445612 It's legal to buy it,<br />it's legal to own it,
445695 449032 and if you're the proprietor<br />of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
449115 451785 It's legal to carry it,<br />but that doesn't matter.
451868 453536 'Cause, get a load of this, all right?
453620 457749 If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,<br />it's illegal for them to search you.
457832 460418 I mean, that's a right<br />the cops in Amsterdam don't have.
460502 463004 Oh, man, I'm going.<br />That's all there is to it.
463088 466299 - I'm fucking going.<br />- I know, baby. You'd dig it the most.
467676 469886 But you know what the funniest thing<br />about Europe is?
469970 472138 - What?<br />- It's the little differences.
472222 473890 I mean, they got the same shit over there
473974 476452 that they got here, but it's just...<br />Just there it's a little different.
476476 478019 - Example.<br />- All right,
478103 481189 well, you can walk into a movie theater<br />in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
481272 483191 And I don't mean just,<br />like, in no paper cup.
483274 484985 I'm talking about a glass of beer.
485068 487946 And in Paris, you can<br />buy a beer at McDonald's.
488029 492409 And you know what they call<br />a quarter pounder with cheese in Paris?
492492 494661 They don't call it<br />a quarter pounder with cheese?
494744 497598 Got the metric system there. They wouldn't<br />know what the fuck a quarter pounder is.
497622 498832 What do they call it?
498915 501501 They call it a "royale with cheese."
501584 503837 - "Royale with cheese."<br />- That's right.
503920 505046 What do they call a big Mac?
505130 508425 Well, big Mac's a big Mac,<br />but they call it "le big Mac."
508508 509968 "Le big Mac."
511678 512971 What do they call a whopper?
513054 515015 I don't know.<br />I didn't go into burger king.
516016 518736 You know what they put on French fries<br />in Holland instead of ketchup?
518810 520311 - What?<br />- Mayonnaise.
520395 522313 Goddamn!
522397 523732 I've seen 'em do it, man.
523815 526818 - They fucking drown 'em in that shit.<br />- Ugh.
529571 532157 We should have shotguns<br />for this kind of deal.
535744 536953 How many up there?
537037 538580 Three or four.
538663 540165 That's counting our guy?
540790 541875 I'm not sure.
542584 544961 So that means it could be<br />up to five guys up there?
545045 546171 It's possible.
546796 548965 We should have fucking shotguns.
549049 550884 - What's her name?<br />- Mia.
550967 553970 Mia. How did marsellus and her meet?
554054 557307 I don't know. However people meet people.
557390 558933 She used to be an actress.
559017 561561 Oh, really? She do anything I'd have seen?
561644 564314 I think her biggest deal<br />was she starred in a pilot.
564397 565982 Pilot? What's a pilot?
566066 567567 Well, you know the shows on TV?
568151 569402 I don't watch TV.
569486 573031 Yeah, but you are aware that there's<br />an invention called television,
573114 575492 and on this invention,<br />they show shows, right?
575575 576576 Yeah.
576659 579370 Well, the way they pick TV shows is,<br />they make one show.
579454 580914 That show's called a pilot.
580997 583333 Then they show that one show<br />to the people who pick shows,
583416 584896 and on the strength of that one show,
584959 586795 they decide if they<br />want to make more shows.
586878 589464 Some get chosen and become<br />television programs.
589547 591633 Some don't, become nothing.
592383 594677 She starred in one of the ones<br />that became nothing.
595720 597722 You remember Antwan rockamora?
597806 601559 Half-black, half-Samoan,<br />used to call him "Tony rocky horror"?
601643 603061 Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?
603144 605146 I wouldn't go so far<br />as to call the brother fat.
605230 608042 I mean, he got a weight problem.<br />What's the nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.
608066 610151 Yeah, I think I know who you mean.<br />What about him?
610235 612403 Well, marsellus fucked him up good.
612487 613905 Word around the campfire is,
613988 616282 it was on account of<br />marsellus Wallace's wife.
625083 626417 So, what'd he do, fuck her?
626501 628920 No, no, no. Nothing that bad.
629003 630630 Well then, what, then?
630713 632382 Gave her a foot massage.
634801 637137 - A foot massage?<br />- Mm-hmm.
637220 639055 - That's it?<br />- Mm-hmm.
639139 641391 Then what did marsellus do?
641474 643143 Sent a couple of cats over to his place.
643226 646271 They took him out on his patio,<br />threw his ass over the balcony.
646354 648523 Nigger fell four stories.
648606 650483 They had a little garden<br />down at the bottom,
650567 652694 enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.
652777 654487 Nigger fell through that.
655071 657824 Since then, he kind of<br />developed a speech impediment.
659576 662120 That's a damn shame.
667000 670128 But still, I have to say,<br />you play with matches, you get burned.
670211 671296 What do you mean?
671379 675008 You don't be giving marsellus Wallace's<br />new bride a foot massage.
675091 676676 You don't think he overreacted?
676759 679137 Well, Antwan probably<br />didn't expect marsellus
679220 680388 to react the way he did,
680471 682557 but he had to expect a reaction.
682640 684726 It was a foot massage.<br />A foot massage is nothing.
684809 687079 I give my mother a foot massage.
687103 690398 No, it's laying hands in a familiar way<br />on marsellus's new wife.
690481 692942 I mean, is it as bad<br />as eating her pussy out?
693026 695195 No, but it's the same fucking ballpark.
695278 696738 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there.
696821 698841 Eating a bitch out<br />and giving a bitch a foot massage
698865 700408 ain't even the same fucking thing.
700491 702076 It's not. It's the same ballpark.
702160 704204 Ain't no fucking ballpark, neither.
704287 707165 Now, look, maybe your method of massage<br />differs from mine,
707248 708958 but, you know, touching his wife's feet
709042 710962 and sticking your tongue<br />in her holiest of holies
711044 712587 ain't the same fucking ballpark.
712670 715215 It ain't the same league.<br />It ain't even the same fucking sport.
715298 717592 Look, foot massages don't mean shit.
717675 720220 Have you ever given a foot massage?
720303 722430 Don't be telling me about foot massages.
722513 724098 I'm the foot fucking master.
724182 725266 You given a lot of 'em?
725350 727560 Shit, yeah.<br />Got my technique down and everything.
727644 729479 I don't be tickling or nothing.
729562 731773 Would you give a guy a foot massage?
733691 734859 Fuck you.
736694 737737 You given 'em a lot?
737820 739113 Fuck you.
739614 742158 You know, I'm kind of tired.<br />I could use a foot massage myself.
742242 745078 Yo, yo, yo, man. You best back off.<br />I'm getting a little pissed here.
747038 749040 - This is the door.<br />- There it is.
752502 753753 What time you got?
755129 757423 7:22 in the am.
757507 760843 No, it ain't quite time yet.<br />Come on. Let's hang back.
768935 771896 Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give<br />no man a foot massage
771980 774416 don't make it right for marsellus<br />to throw Antwan off a building
774440 777086 into a glass motherfucking house,<br />fucking up the way the nigger talks.
777110 778361 That shit ain't right.
778444 779779 Motherfucker do that shit to me,
779862 782174 he better paralyze my ass,<br />'cause I'd kill the motherfucker.
782198 784385 - You know what I'm saying?<br />- I ain't saying it's right.
784409 786345 But you're saying a foot massage<br />don't mean nothing
786369 787787 and I'm saying it does.
787870 789390 Now, look, I've given a million ladies
789455 792250 a million foot massages,<br />and they all meant something.
792333 794335 Now, we act like they don't, but they do.
794419 796254 That's what's so fucking cool about 'em.
796337 798673 There's a sensuous thing<br />going on where, you know,
798756 801759 you don't talk about it,<br />but you know it, and she knows it.
801843 803344 Fucking marsellus knew it,
803428 805930 and Antwan should've<br />fucking better known better.
806889 808599 I mean, that's his fucking wife, man.
808683 811227 This ain't a man<br />with a sense of humor about this shit.
811311 812812 You know what I'm saying?
814272 815690 It's an interesting point.
816399 818443 Come on. Let's get into character.
824991 826218 What's her name again?
826242 827493 - Mia.<br />- Mia.
827577 830288 Why you so interested<br />in big man's wife?
830371 832224 Well,<br />he's going out of town, Florida,
832248 834917 and he asked me if I'd<br />take care of her while he's gone.
835710 836836 Take care of her?
836919 838921 No, man. Just take her out.
839005 840923 You know, show her a good time.
841007 842342 Make sure she don't get lonely.
843051 845636 You're gonna be taking<br />Mia Wallace out on a date?
845720 847722 It is not a date.
847805 850016 You know, it's just like<br />if you were going to take
850099 852602 your buddy's wife to a movie or something.
852685 854479 It's just good company, that's all.
860068 861944 It's not a date.
862028 864447 It's definitely not a date.
871162 872163 Hey, kids.
873456 874957 How you boys doing?
875041 876542 Hey, keep chilling.
884926 886386 You know who we are?
887428 889472 We're associates of your business partner,
889555 891140 marsellus Wallace.
891224 893810 You do remember<br />your business partner, don't you?
896521 898189 Now, let me take a wild guess here.
901943 903569 You're Brett, right?
903653 904529 Yeah.
904612 905863 Ithoughtso.
906531 909117 You remember your business partner,<br />marsellus Wallace,
909200 910410 don't you, Brett?
911494 913704 - Yeah, I remember him.<br />- Good.
914288 917041 Looks like me and Vincent<br />caught you boys at breakfast.
917125 919544 Sorry about that. What you having?
920795 921712 Hamburgers.
921796 923381 Hamburgers!
923464 925883 The cornerstone of<br />any nutritious breakfast.
926759 928302 What kind of hamburgers?
929637 930847 Cheeseburgers.
930930 932682 No, no, no, no. Where'd you get 'em?
932765 935393 McDonald's, Wendy's,<br />Jack in the box, where?
935476 937395 Um, big kahuna burger.
937478 938688 Big kahuna burger.
938771 940648 That's that Hawaiian burgerjoint.
940731 942608 I hear they got some tasty burgers.
942692 944610 I ain't never had one myself.<br />How are they?
946154 948865 - They're good.<br />- You mind if I try one of yours?
950658 952577 - This is yours here, right?<br />- Yeah.
962879 964839 This is a tasty burger.
965465 968217 Vincent, you ever had a big kahuna burger?
969469 971387 Want a bite? They're real tasty.
971971 972972 I ain't hungry.
973055 975516 Well, if you like burgers,<br />give 'em a try sometime.
975600 977977 Me, I can't usually get 'em,
978060 979729 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,
979812 982064 which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.
982732 985860 But I do love the taste<br />of a good burger. Mmm.
987320 989906 You know what they call<br />a quarter pounder with cheese in France?
992158 994952 - Tell him, Vincent.<br />- Royale with cheese.
995036 996704 Royale with cheese.
996787 998623 You know why they call it that?
1000416 1003377 Uh, because of the metric system?
1004504 1007256 Check out the big brain on Brett!
1007965 1011177 You're a smart motherfucker.<br />That's right. The metric system.
1013554 1014555 What's in this?
1015264 1017141 - Sprite.<br />- Sprite, good.
1017225 1020019 You mind if I have<br />some of your tasty beverage
1020102 1021562 to wash this down with?
1022313 1023314 Go right ahead.
1035952 1037203 That hit the spot.
1038871 1040623 You, flock of seagulls.
1040706 1041874 You know why we're here?
1043000 1045640 Why don't you tell my man Vince here<br />where you got the shit hid at?
1045711 1046546 It's over there.
1046629 1050216 I don't remember<br />asking you a goddamn thing!
1054887 1055887 You were saying?
1056514 1057848 It's in the cupboard.
1060893 1063020 No. The one by your knees.
1084625 1085626 We happy?
1087044 1088045 Vincent?
1089797 1092425 - We happy?<br />- Yeah, we happy.
1094427 1095428 Look...
1096470 1098848 I'm sorry, I... I didn't get your name.
1098931 1101350 I got yours. Uh, Vincent, right?
1101434 1103561 - But... but I never got yours.<br />- My name's pitt,
1103644 1105896 and your ass ain't talking your way<br />out of this shit.
1105980 1107440 No, no, no.
1108983 1111068 I just want you to know how...
1114614 1118159 I just want you to know how sorry we are<br />that... that things got so fucked up
1118242 1119910 with us and... and Mr. Wallace.
1119994 1121704 We got into this thing
1121787 1123056 with the best intentions, really.
1123080 1124373 I never inten...
1125958 1128377 Oh, I'm sorry.<br />Did I break your concentration?
1129337 1132465 I didn't mean to do that.<br />Please, continue.
1133132 1136302 You were saying something<br />about "best intentions."
1137762 1138846 What's the matter?
1139930 1141599 Oh, you were finished?
1141682 1143976 Well, allow me to retort.
1148022 1150941 What does marsellus Wallace look like?
1152068 1153194 What?
1154362 1156530 - What country are you from?<br />- What?
1156614 1159408 "What" ain't no country I ever heard of!<br />They speak English in "what"?
1159492 1160868 What?
1160951 1163663 - English, motherfucker! Do you speak it?<br />- Yes!
1163746 1165414 - Then you know what I'm saying.<br />- Yes!
1165498 1168918 Describe what marsellus Wallace<br />looks like!
1169752 1170795 What? I...
1170878 1173422 Say "what" again. Say "what" again!
1173506 1175633 I dare you!<br />I double-dare you, motherfucker!
1175716 1177760 Say "what" one more goddamn time!
1177843 1179595 He's... he's black.
1179679 1180805 Go on!
1180888 1182014 He's bald.
1182098 1183724 Does he look like a bitch?
1183808 1184809 What?
1186560 1190564 Does he look like a bitch?
1191774 1193818 Then why you trying to fuck him<br />like a bitch, Brett?
1193901 1195319 - I didn't.<br />- Yes, you did.
1195403 1197571 Yes, you did, Brett!
1197655 1199824 - You tried to fuck him.<br />- No.
1199907 1201826 Well, marsellus Wallace<br />don't like to be fucked
1201909 1204370 by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
1205329 1206455 You read the Bible, Brett?
1206539 1208416 Yes.
1208499 1211043 Well, there's this passage<br />I got memorized.
1211127 1213045 Sort of fits this occasion.
1213129 1215339 Ezekiel 25:17.
1216590 1220928 "The path of the righteous man<br />is beset on all sides
1221011 1225725 by the inequities of the selfish<br />and the tyranny of evil men.
1226308 1230730 Blessed is he who,<br />in the name of charity and good will,
1230813 1234108 Shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness,
1234191 1236861 for he is truly his brother's keeper
1236944 1240322 and the finder of lost children.
1240406 1242742 And I will strike down upon thee
1242825 1246495 with great vengeance and furious anger
1246579 1250958 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy my brothers.
1251041 1254920 And you will know my name is the lord
1255004 1258340 when I lay my vengeance upon thee!"
1270936 1272396 J” let's sfa y fogez'berj”
1276734 1278360 I think you're gonna find,
1279278 1281530 when all this shit is over and done...
1283741 1287369 I think you're gonna find yourself<br />one smiling motherfucker.
1289705 1291207 Thing is, butch,
1292458 1295419 right now you got ability.
1297213 1299548 But painful as it may be,
1299632 1302718 ability don't last.
1304845 1307431 And your days are just about over.
1309099 1312269 Now, that's a hard<br />motherfucking fact of life,
1313521 1317149 but that's a fact of life your ass<br />is gonna have to get realistic about.
1320486 1324657 See, this business is filled to the brim<br />with unrealistic motherfuckers.
1326075 1329495 Motherfuckers who thought their ass<br />would age like wine.
1331705 1334333 If you mean it turns to vinegar,
1334416 1335751 it does.
1336627 1338754 If you mean it gets better with age,
1339380 1340714 it don't.
1342591 1343968 Besides, butch...
1346178 1349139 How many fights you think<br />you got in you, anyway?
1352268 1353394 Two?
1355396 1358315 Boxers don't have an old-timer's day.
1359984 1362695 You came close, but you never made it.
1363904 1366949 And if you were gonna make it,<br />you would have made it before now.
1367032 1369535 J” times are good or bad j”
1369618 1372496 j” happy or sad j”
1380880 1381922 J” yeah j”
1384717 1385885 you my nigger?
1385968 1391056 J” whether times are good or bad<br />happy or sad .. J”
1391765 1393642 it certainly appears so.
1400524 1404403 The night of the fight,<br />you may feel a slight sting.
1407698 1410868 That's pride fucking with you.
1412119 1414246 Fuck pride!
1416540 1418083 Pride only hurts.
1419543 1421045 It never helps.
1422963 1424590 You fight through that shit.
1426425 1428260 'Cause a year from now,
1428969 1431472 when you kicking it in the Caribbean,
1431555 1436268 you gonna say to yourself,<br />"marsellus Wallace was right."
1436852 1440189 I got no problem with that, Mr. Wallace.
1442816 1446236 In the fifth, your ass goes down.
1450658 1451784 Say it.
1454745 1456914 In the fifth, my ass goes down.
1460084 1462795 Yo, Vincent vega, our man in Amsterdam.
1462878 1464880 Jules winnfield, our man in inglewood.
1464964 1466840 Get your asses on in here!
1467383 1468384 Goddamn, nigger!
1468467 1471187 - What's up with them clothes?<br />- You don't even want to know.
1473347 1474640 Where's the big man?
1474723 1477267 Big man's right over there<br />taking care of some business.
1477351 1479561 Why don't you hang back<br />for a second or two, you know?
1479645 1481814 When you see the white boy leave,<br />just go on over.
1484942 1486068 How you been?
1487027 1488946 I've been doing pretty good.<br />How 'bout yourself?
1489029 1490155 All right.
1493283 1495411 So, I hear you're taking Mia out tomorrow.
1498539 1500749 At marsellus's request.
1502835 1504920 - Have you met Mia?<br />- Not yet.
1505004 1507506 What's so fucking funny?
1507589 1510342 - Not a goddamn thing.<br />- I got to piss.
1511218 1513554 Look, I'm not a fucking idiot, all right?
1513637 1514805 It's the big man's wife.
1514888 1517850 I'm gonna sit across from her,<br />chew my food with my mouth closed,
1517933 1519643 laugh at her fucking jokes, and that's it.
1519727 1522855 Hey, my name's Paul,<br />and this shit's between y'all.
1522938 1525691 Then what did you fucking<br />ask me about it for?

1541874 1543500 you looking at something, friend?
1543584 1545461 You ain't my friend, palooka.
1547921 1550924 - What was that?<br />- I think you heard me just fine, punchy.
1551675 1553510 Vincent vega's in the house?
1554178 1557014 My nigger. Get your ass over here.
1560934 1564897 J” you'd never do that to me j”
1564980 1568108 - What's up?<br />- Man, I'm sorry.
1568192 1569985 Don't worry about it.
1570069 1571779 Pack of red apples.
1571862 1572988 $1.40.
1575449 1576825 And some matches.
1577826 1579703 J” hereis what/ want to do j”
1579787 1582456 j” heyj”
1583082 1584541 j” we ought to stay togetherj”
1584625 1589338 It's as if it turns every part<br />of your body into the tip of a penis.
1589421 1590547 Wow.
1590631 1593092 I'll lend it to you.<br />It's a great book on piercing.
1593175 1595469 Well, you see how they use that gun<br />to Pierce your ears?
1595552 1597614 They don't use that to Pierce<br />your nipples, too, do they?
1597638 1601475 Forget that gun. That gun goes against<br />the entire idea behind piercing.
1603060 1606897 All my piercing, 18 places on my body,<br />every one of 'em done with a needle.
1606980 1609983 Five in each ear.<br />One through the nipple of my left breast.
1610651 1613195 Two in my right nostril.<br />One in my left eyebrow.
1613278 1616115 One in my belly. One in my lip.<br />One in my clit.
1616198 1618450 And I wear a stud in my tongue.
1618534 1619660 Excuse me.
1620327 1622579 I was just curious, but, um,
1623455 1625624 why would you wear a stud in your tongue?
1626250 1627709 It's a sex thing.
1627793 1629169 Helps fellatio.
1629253 1630754 Vincenzo.
1631713 1633215 Step into my office.
1634341 1635717 Let's go, man.
1640013 1643100 This is panda, from Mexico.<br />Very good stuff.
1643183 1646061 Now, that's bava.<br />Different, but equally good.
1646145 1647563 And that is choco.
1647646 1649690 From the harz mountains of Germany.
1649773 1653902 Now, the first two are the same...<br />300 a gram. Those are friend prices.
1654695 1657114 But this one is a little more expensive.
1657197 1659074 This is 500 a gram.
1659158 1663036 But when you shoot it,<br />you will know where that extra money went.
1663120 1667332 Now, there's nothing wrong with these two.<br />This is real, real, real good shit.
1667416 1670043 But this one is a fucking madman.
1671086 1673755 Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.
1673839 1676049 Am I a nigger? Are we in inglewood?
1676133 1678468 No. You're in my home.
1678552 1681555 Now, white people who know the difference<br />between good shit and bad shit,
1681638 1683307 this is the house they come to.
1683390 1686727 My shit, I'll take the Pepsi challenge<br />with that Amsterdam shit
1686810 1688437 any old day of the fucking week.
1688520 1692024 - That's a bold statement.<br />- This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.
1692107 1694109 This is a seller's market.
1694193 1698071 Coke is fucking dead as... dead.
1698155 1701033 Heroin is coming back<br />in a big fucking way.
1703493 1706663 - All right, give me three grams of madman.<br />- Okay.
1706747 1709726 And if it's as good as you say it is,<br />I'll come back and buy another thousand.
1709750 1712878 Well, I just hope that I still have<br />some left for you.
1712961 1717382 But I'm giving you some<br />out of my own private stash.
1717466 1719468 That is what a nice guy I am.
1720719 1723430 Hey, I'm out of balloons.<br />Is a baggie all right?
1723513 1726767 - Yeah, that's cool.<br />- All right. I'll just get one for you.
1726850 1731730 Honey, will you get me some baggies<br />and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?
1731813 1733023 Okay.
1733732 1736026 Hey, what do you think about Trudi?
1736109 1739363 She ain't got a boyfriend.<br />You want to hang out, get high?
1739446 1742824 Which one is Trudi?<br />The one with all the shit in her face?
1742908 1745327 No, that's Jody.
1745410 1746703 That's my wife.
1747621 1750624 That one hurt, man.
1750707 1751833 Thank you.
1752459 1754503 No, I can't. I gotta be some place.
1754586 1755879 All right. No problemo.
1755963 1757756 I'll take a rain check.
1761093 1762344 "Thank you, Jody."
1762928 1764388 Still got your Malibu?
1765889 1769059 Oh, man. You know what some fucker<br />did the other day?
1769142 1770894 - What?<br />- Fucking keyed it.
1770978 1774564 - Oh, man. That's fucked up.<br />- Tell me about it.
1774648 1777317 I had it in storage for three years.
1777401 1779236 It was out five days,
1779319 1781738 and some dickless piece of shit<br />fucked with it.
1781822 1783502 They should be<br />fucking killed, man.
1783573 1786243 No trial, no jury. Straight to execution.
1786326 1788495 Boy, I wish I could've<br />caught him doing it.
1788578 1791039 I'd have given anything<br />to catch that asshole doing it.
1791123 1794126 It'd been worth him doing it<br />just so I could've caught him doing it.
1794209 1795836 What a fucker.
1795919 1798714 What's more chicken shit<br />than fucking with a man's automobile?
1798797 1800841 I mean, don't fuck<br />with another man's vehicle.
1800924 1803468 - You don't do it.<br />- It's just against the rules.
1803552 1805095 - Thank you.<br />- Thank you.
1806638 1809599 - Mind if I shoot up here?<br />- Hey, mi casa es su casa.
1809683 1811393 Muchas gracias.

2246911 2248913 Did you just order a five-dollar shake?
2249581 2251040 Mm-hmm.
2251124 2252333 That's a shake.
2252417 2255295 - That's milk and ice cream.<br />- Last I heard.
2255378 2257046 - That's five dollars?<br />- Uh-huh.
2257130 2259758 - You don't put bourbon in it or nothing?<br />- No.
2260341 2262886 - Just checking.<br />- I'll be right back with your drinks.
2262969 2265138 J” going down to lonesome town j”

2271770 2275648 could you, um, roll me<br />one of those, cowboy?
2276900 2278610 You can have this one, cowgirl.
2278693 2279861 Thanks.
2279944 2283072 J” the streets are filled with regret j”
2285283 2286576 think nothing of it.
2286659 2290413 J” maybe down in lonesome town j”
2291372 2293875 j” I can learn to forget j”
2293958 2298046 so... marsellus said you just<br />got back from Amsterdam.
2298671 2300757 - Sure did.<br />- How long were you there?
2300840 2303843 Uh, just over three years.
2303927 2306304 J” I can learn to forget j”
2306387 2309224 I go there about once a year<br />to chill out for a month.
2309933 2311476 No kidding?
2311559 2313019 I didn't know that.
2314437 2316022 Why would you?
2320485 2322654 I heard you did a pilot.
2323988 2325990 That was my 15 minutes.
2326074 2327617 What was it?
2327700 2330411 It was a show about a team<br />of female secret agents
2330495 2332372 called fox force five.
2332455 2335166 - What?<br />- Fox force five.
2335250 2337585 Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks.
2337669 2340129 Force, as in we're a force<br />to be reckoned with.
2340213 2342882 And five, as in there's<br />one, two, three, four, five of us.
2343633 2345468 There was a blonde one... sommerset O'Neal.
2345552 2346678 She was the leader.
2346761 2349931 The Japanese fox was a kung fu master.
2350014 2354018 The black girl was a demolition expert.
2354102 2356938 French fox's speciality was sex.
2357021 2358565 What was your specialty?
2359357 2361317 Knives.
2361401 2363444 Character I played, raven McCoy,
2363528 2367407 her background was<br />she grew up raised by circus performers.
2367490 2368867 According to the show,
2368950 2371744 she was the deadliest woman in the world<br />with a knife.
2372453 2374581 And she knew a zillion old jokes.
2374664 2378001 Her grandfather,<br />an old vaudevillian, taught her.
2378877 2380879 And if we would've got picked up,
2380962 2383339 they would've worked in a gimmick<br />where every show,
2383423 2386092 I would've told anotherjoke.
2388094 2390096 You know any of them old jokes?
2390179 2393892 Well, I only got the chance to say one,<br />'cause we only did one show.
2393975 2395018 Tell me.
2395101 2396352 It's corny.
2397645 2399397 Don't be that way. Tell me.
2399480 2402525 Nah. You wouldn't like it,<br />and I'd be embarrassed.
2402609 2407280 You'd be em... you told, like,<br />50 million people, and you can't tell me?
2407363 2409574 I promise I won't laugh.
2409657 2411242 That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.
2411826 2413620 That's not what I meant, and you know it.
2413703 2417123 Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you,<br />'cause it's been built up too much.
2417707 2419125 What a gyp.
2421961 2423338 Martin and Lewis.
2426382 2428009 Vanilla coke.
2433181 2434390 Mmm.
2435475 2436476 Yummy.
2436559 2438519 You think I could have a sip of that?
2441898 2443232 Be my guest.
2443316 2446110 I gotta know<br />what a five-dollar shake tastes like.
2447403 2449447 You can use my straw.<br />I don't have cooties.
2449530 2452283 - Yeah, but maybe I do.<br />- Cooties, I can handle.
2454118 2455328 All right.
2463419 2465713 Goddamn,<br />that's a pretty fucking good milk shake.
2465797 2466798 Told ya.
2466881 2469842 Don't know if it was worth five dollars,<br />but it was pretty fucking good.
2504794 2506587 Don't you hate that?
2507255 2510717 - Hate what?<br />- Uncomfortable silences.
2512260 2515596 Why do we feel it's necessary<br />to yak about bullshit
2515680 2517265 in order to be comfortable?
2518224 2520560 I don't know, but it's a good question.
2522395 2525398 That's when you know<br />you've found somebody really special,
2526190 2528693 when you can just shut the fuck up<br />for a minute
2528776 2530862 and comfortably share a silence.
2530945 2533340 Well, I don't think we're quite there yet,<br />but don't feel bad.
2533364 2535033 We just met each other.
2536534 2537869 I'll tell you what.
2539996 2542957 I'm gonna go to the bathroom<br />and powder my nose.
2543041 2546252 You sit here and think<br />of something to say.
2547336 2548796 I'll do that.
2552508 2553718 Okay.
2578868 2581037 I said goddamn!
2581120 2583206 Goddamn.
2583289 2584415 Goddamn.
2586667 2588336 I need some hair spray.
2597512 2599847 Don't you just love it<br />when you come back from the bathroom
2599931 2601849 to find your food waiting for you?
2601933 2604268 We're lucky we got anything at all.
2604352 2606479 I don't think buddy Holly's<br />much of a waiter.
2607688 2609583 Maybe we should've sat<br />in Marilyn Monroe's section.
2609607 2611835 - Would you like some coffee?<br />- Which one? There's two monroes.
2611859 2612899 No, there's not.
2613694 2614904 That is Marilyn Monroe.
2617365 2619158 That is mamie Van doren.
2620243 2624080 And I don't see jayne Mansfield.<br />She must have the night off or something.
2624163 2625748 Pretty smart.
2625832 2627583 Yeah, I got my moments.
2627667 2631170 - So, did you think of something to say?<br />- Actually, I did.
2633506 2634757 However...
2638302 2641681 You seem like a really nice person,<br />and I... I don't want to offend you.
2641764 2643432 Ooh!
2643516 2646269 This doesn't sound like<br />the usual mindless, boring,
2646352 2648563 getting-to-know-you chitchat.
2648646 2651023 This sounds like you actually<br />have something to say.
2651107 2653401 Well, well, I do. I do.
2655194 2657280 But you have to promise<br />not to be offended.
2657363 2658656 No! No, no, no.
2658739 2662660 You can't promise something like that.<br />I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.
2662743 2664847 So you can go ahead and ask me<br />what you're gonna ask me,
2664871 2667874 and my natural response<br />could be to get offended.
2667957 2670394 Then, through no fault of my own,<br />I would've broken my promise.
2670418 2673087 - Let's just forget it.<br />- That's an impossibility.
2673171 2675506 Trying to forget anything<br />as intriguing as this
2675590 2677216 would be an exercise in futility.
2677300 2678593 Is that a fact?
2678676 2683097 And besides, isn't it more, uh, exciting<br />when you don't have permission?
2683181 2684599 All right. All right.
2684682 2686267 Well, here goes.
2686350 2690563 Uh, what did you, uh, think<br />about what happened to Antwan?
2690646 2691647 Who's Antwan?
2691731 2694066 Tony rocky horror. You know him.
2694150 2695651 He fell out of a window.
2695735 2697528 Mmm. Hmm.
2697612 2699363 Well, that is one way to say it.
2699447 2702158 Another way to say it would be<br />that he was thrown out.
2702241 2705411 Another way would be<br />was he was thrown out by marsellus,
2705494 2707496 and yet even another way is to say
2707580 2710583 he was thrown out of a window by marsellus<br />because of you.
2710666 2712585 Is that a fact?
2712668 2714962 No, no. It's not a fact.<br />It's just what I heard.
2715046 2716297 It's just what I heard.
2716380 2718007 Who told you?
2718090 2719342 They.
2720301 2721802 They talk a lot, don't they?
2724013 2726641 They certainly do. They certainly do.
2726724 2728726 Don't be shy, Vincent.<br />What else did they say?
2728809 2731604 Well, I'm not... I'm not shy. I don't...
2731687 2733731 Did it involve the f-word?
2733814 2735149 No. No, no, no.
2735233 2737777 They just said that Antwan<br />had given you a foot massage.
2739320 2740488 And?
2740571 2742782 And nothing. That's it.
2744992 2747203 You heard marsellus
2747286 2749580 threw Tony rocky horror<br />out of a four-story window
2749664 2751249 for giving me a foot massage?
2751332 2753459 - Mm-hmm.<br />- And you believe that?
2755044 2758089 Well, I mean, at the time I was told,<br />it sounded reasonable.
2758172 2761342 Marsellus throwing Tony<br />out of a four-story window
2761425 2763761 for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?
2763844 2767181 No, it seemed excessive,<br />but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.
2767265 2770643 I mean, I understand that marsellus<br />is very, very protective of you.
2771602 2775189 A husband being protective<br />of his wife is one thing.
2775273 2777833 A husband almost killing another man<br />for touching his wife's feet
2777900 2779151 is something else.
2779986 2781320 But did it happen?
2781404 2784573 Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine<br />was my hand when he shook it...
2785658 2786784 At my wedding.
2787827 2789203 Really?
2789287 2792790 Truth is, nobody knows why marsellus<br />threw Tony out of that four-story window
2792873 2794875 except marsellus and Tony.
2795626 2798963 But when you little scamps get together,<br />you're worse than a sewing circle.
2799046 2801048 Ladies and gentlemen.
2801132 2803551 Now the moment you've all<br />been waiting for,
2803634 2808222 the world-famous Jack rabbit slim's<br />twist contest.
2812601 2815479 This is where one lucky couple
2815563 2819608 will win this handsome trophy<br />that Marilyn here is holding.
2819692 2823195 Now, who will be our first contestants?
2823279 2824488 Right here!
2824572 2826073 Hey, all right!
2826782 2829160 - I wanna dance.<br />- No, no, no, no, no.
2829243 2831370 No, no, no, no, no, no.
2831454 2833998 I do believe marsellus,<br />my husband, your boss,
2834081 2837043 told you to take me out<br />and do whatever I wanted.
2837126 2839628 And now I want to dance. I want to win.
2839712 2843174 - I want that trophy, so dance good.<br />- All right. You asked for it.
2843257 2845009 Let's hear it for our first contestants.
2851557 2854435 Let's meet our first contestants<br />here this evening.

3391179 3393765 - Negative.<br />- This is not my fucking problem, man!
3393849 3396059 You fucked her up,<br />you fucking deal with this!
3397603 3399938 Are you talking to me on a cellular phone?

3403775 3405235 Prank caller! Prank caller!
3415954 3417247 What the hell was that?
3419291 3421543 Have you lost your fucking mind?
3421627 3423646 - You were talking about drug shit...<br />- Lance, help me.
3423670 3425350 You crashed your car<br />into my fucking house!
3425422 3428133 - Grab her feet.<br />- Hey, hey! Are you deaf?
3428216 3431219 You are not bringing this<br />fucked-up bitch into my house!
3431303 3433347 This fucked-up bitch is<br />marsellus Wallace's wife.
3433430 3435515 Do you know who marsellus Wallace is?<br />Do you?
3435599 3436701 - Yeah.<br />- If she croaks on me,

3464544 3465629 Look, go in the fridge
3465712 3467673 and get the thing<br />with that adrenaline shot.
3467756 3468757 What's wrong with her?

3477849 3479577 I'm gonna go get my little<br />black medical book.
3479601 3481162 What the fuck you need a medical book for?
3481186 3483581 To tell me what to do. I never had to give<br />an adrenaline shot before.
3483605 3485541 - You've never given an adrenaline shot?<br />- I never had to.
3485565 3487377 I don't go joypopping<br />with a bunch of bubblegummers.
3487401 3489170 - My friends can handle their highs.<br />- Get the shot!
3489194 3491381 - Look, I am if you'll let me.<br />- I ain't fucking stopping you!
3491405 3492924 Well, stop talking to me.<br />Start talking to her!
3492948 3494658 - Get the shot!<br />- All right!
3498912 3500747 Hurry up, Lance! We're losing her!
3500831 3503311 - I'm looking as fast as I can!<br />- What's he looking for?
3504084 3505836 I don't know. Some book.
3505919 3508880 - What are you looking for?<br />- My little black medical book!
3508964 3511609 - What are you looking for?<br />- A little black fucking medical book!
3511633 3514344 It's like a textbook they give to nurses.
3514428 3517514 - I never saw no medical book.<br />- Well, trust me, I have one.
3517597 3519993 Well, if it's so important,<br />why don't you keep it with the shot?
3520017 3521560 I don't know! Stop bothering me!
3521643 3524330 Listen, while you're looking for it,<br />that girl's gonna die on our carpet.
3524354 3525957 You're never gonna find anything in here.
3525981 3527792 I'm going to fucking kill you<br />if you don't shut up!
3527816 3529776 - Clean this shit up!<br />- Get in here!
3530777 3531820 Christ.
3531903 3533572 Get the fuck out of my way.
3533655 3535949 - Pig.<br />- Quit fucking around. Give her the shot.
3536033 3537075 - Come on.<br />- Okay.
3537159 3540120 Look, while I'm doing this,<br />you take off her shirt and find her heart.
3540912 3543266 - Got to be exact?<br />- Yeah, it's got to be exact.
3543290 3545685 I'm giving her a shot in the heart,<br />so I guess it's got to be exact.
3545709 3548062 I don't know exactly where her heart is.<br />I think it's right here.
3548086 3549671 - That's it.<br />- This it? All right.
3549755 3551757 What I need is a big fat magic marker.
3552716 3553925 - You got it?<br />- What?
3554009 3556845 A magic marker! A felt pen!
3556928 3558680 A fucking black magic marker!
3558764 3559931 All right. All right.
3560015 3563518 - Come on, man. Hurry up.<br />- Fuck. Okay, okay. Okay.
3563602 3564603 I think it's ready.
3567773 3570275 - Hurry up, man. Hurry up.<br />- Here, I'll tell you what to do.
3570358 3572336 No. Man, I ain't giving...<br />You're gonna give her the shot.
3572360 3573796 - You're gonna give her the shot.<br />- I ain't.
3573820 3575715 - I ain't giving her the shot.<br />- I never done this before.
3575739 3577759 I ain't never done it before either.<br />I ain't starting now.
3577783 3579927 You brought her here. That means<br />you're gonna give her the shot.
3579951 3581471 The day I bring an od'ing bitch<br />to your house,
3581495 3582972 I give her the shot. Give her the shot.
3582996 3584831 - Give it to me. Give me that.<br />- Here.
3585916 3588043 All right. Tell me what to do.
3588126 3590879 Okay. Uh, you're giving her<br />an injection of adrenaline
3590962 3593941 straight to her heart, but she's got<br />a breastplate. Got to Pierce through that.
3593965 3596069 So what you gotta do is you<br />gotta bring the needle down
3596093 3598470 - in a stabbing motion.<br />- I gotta stab her three times?
3598553 3600193 No! You don't gotta stab her three times.
3600222 3601783 Stab her once,<br />but it's gotta be hard enough
3601807 3603576 to get through her breastplate<br />into her heart.
3603600 3606353 All right? And then once you do that,<br />you press down on the plunger.
3606436 3608271 Okay, then what happens?
3608355 3611084 - I'm kind of curious about that myself.<br />- This ain't no fucking joke, man!
3611108 3612400 - Am I gonna kill her?<br />- No, no!
3612484 3614653 She's supposed to come out of it<br />like that. It's...
3614736 3616780 All right. Count to three.<br />All right. Ready?
3616863 3618240 One...
3623537 3625080 Two...
3633588 3635006 Three!
3649855 3651022 If you're all right,
3651106 3652858 then say something.
3653942 3655068 Something.
3656027 3658196 That was fucking trippy.
3661950 3663285 Oh, man.
3688768 3690520 Mia. Mia.
3692898 3694149 What's...
3695859 3697569 What's your thoughts on...
3698195 3699863 On how to handle this?
3700739 3702073 What's yours?
3705410 3707621 Well, I'm of the opinion
3707704 3709623 that if marsellus lived his whole life,
3709706 3712334 he don't need to know nothing<br />about this incident.
3713835 3715879 If marsellus knew about this incident,
3715962 3718173 I'd be in as much trouble as you.
3718256 3720175 I seriously doubt that.
3721426 3723470 I can keep a secret if you can.
3725847 3727182 Shake on it?
3733688 3734940 Mum's the word?
3736024 3737234 Cool.
3738068 3740748 Now, if you'll excuse me,<br />I'm gonna go home and have a heart attack.
3744324 3745325 Vincent.
3748203 3751206 Do you want to hear<br />my fox force fivejoke?
3752290 3753416 Sure.
3754376 3757545 Except that I think<br />I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.
3757629 3760257 No, you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny.
3760340 3762717 But if you still wanna hear it,<br />I'll tell it.
3763468 3764928 I can't wait.
3765011 3766012 Okay.
3766596 3768431 Three tomatoes are walking<br />down the street.
3768515 3770934 Papa tomato, mama tomato, and baby tomato.
3771017 3775814 Baby tomato starts lagging behind<br />and papa tomato gets really angry,
3775897 3777857 goes back and squishes him,
3777941 3779859 and says, "catch up."
3781569 3783029 Mmm.
3783697 3784698 Ketchup.

3831369 3832954 Butch, stop watching TV a second.
3833830 3835749 - Yeah?<br />- We got a special visitor.
3839544 3840545 Now...
3841379 3844132 Do you remember when I told you<br />your daddy died in a pow camp?
3845800 3849429 Well, this here is captain koons.
3849512 3851431 He was in the pow camp with daddy.
3858146 3859898 Hello, little man.
3859981 3862650 Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.
3863943 3866237 See, I was a good friend of your dad's.
3867197 3870325 We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together
3870408 3871868 over five years.
3873036 3874287 Hopefully...
3875580 3877582 You'll never have to<br />experience this yourself,
3877665 3880126 but when two men are in a situation
3880210 3883088 like me and your dad were,<br />for as long as we were,
3884422 3887175 you take on certain responsibilities<br />of the other.
3888676 3890178 If it had been me who'd...
3892305 3893723 Not made it,
3893807 3898103 major coolidge would be talking right now<br />to my son Jim.
3899062 3901231 But the way it turned out,<br />I'm talking to you...
3903400 3904609 Butch.
3906236 3907779 I got something for ya.
3915328 3917372 This watch I got here
3917455 3919749 was first purchased<br />by your great-grandfather
3919833 3921501 during the first world war.
3922252 3924337 It was bought in a little general store
3924421 3926005 in Knoxville, Tennessee.
3926881 3930427 Made by the first company<br />to ever make wristwatches.
3930510 3933263 Up till then, people just<br />carried pocket watches.
3933346 3936766 It was bought<br />by private doughboy erine coolidge
3936850 3939060 on the day he set sail for Paris.
3939811 3941938 This was your great-grandfather's<br />war watch,
3942021 3944816 and he wore it every day<br />he was in that war.
3945859 3949446 And when he'd done his duty,<br />he went home to your great-grandmother,
3949529 3951156 took the watch off,
3951239 3953783 put it in an old coffee can,<br />and in that can it stayed
3954617 3956703 till your grandad, Dane coolidge,
3956786 3958163 was called upon by his country
3958246 3962083 to go overseas and fight the Germans<br />once again.
3962167 3964335 This time they called it world war two.
3966004 3969716 Your great-grandfather gave this watch<br />to your grandad for good luck.
3970967 3973928 Unfortunately, Dane's luck<br />wasn't as good as his old man's.
3974012 3976097 Dane was a marine, and he was killed
3976806 3979726 along with all the other marines<br />at the battle of wake island.
3980602 3982896 Your grandad was facing death.
3984022 3985148 He knew it.
3986065 3990028 None of those boys had any illusions<br />about ever leaving that island alive.
3990111 3993239 So, three days before<br />the Japanese took the island,
3993323 3996493 your grandad asked a gunner<br />on an air force transport,
3996576 3998119 name of winocki,
3999037 4001414 a man he had never met before in his life,
4001498 4003917 to deliver to his infant son,
4004667 4006920 who he had never seen in the flesh,
4007003 4008296 his gold watch.
4009464 4013593 Three days later, your grandad was dead,<br />but winocki kept his word.
4014427 4017931 After the war was over,<br />he paid a visit to your grandmother,
4018014 4020308 delivering to your infant father
4020391 4022227 his dad's gold watch.
4022310 4023645 This watch.
4030360 4032445 This watch was on your daddy's wrist
4032529 4035532 when he was shot down over Hanoi.
4035615 4039035 He was captured,<br />put in a Vietnamese prison camp.
4039118 4042997 He knew that if the gooks<br />ever saw the watch,
4043081 4046209 they'd confiscate it and take it away.
4046960 4050588 The way your dad looked at it,<br />this watch was your birthright.
4050672 4053192 He'd be damned if any slopes<br />gonna put their greasy yellow hands
4053258 4054342 on his boy's birthright,
4054425 4058721 so he hid it in one place he knew<br />he could hide something, his ass.
4058805 4060807 Five long years he wore this watch
4060890 4062141 up his ass.
4062225 4064811 Then he died of dysentery,
4064894 4066521 he give me the watch.
4066604 4070149 I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal<br />up my ass, two years.
4070233 4073403 Then... after seven years,
4073486 4075446 I was sent home to my family. And...
4076656 4077699 Now...
4081035 4083371 Little man, I give the watch to you.
4086082 4087667 [Gasps}
4106811 4108313 It's time, butch.
4122952 4125163 Weighing 270 pounds,
4126205 4129459 Floyd ray Wilson. I
4132211 4134565 Ltis ohicial<br />it's ofi'icial. Wilson is dead!
4134589 4136650 Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest
4136674 4138902 and hands down the most brutal fight<br />this city has ever seen.
4138926 4140206 Coolidge was out of there faster
4140261 4142555 than / 've ever seen<br />a victorious boxer leave the ring.
4142639 4144116 Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
4144140 4145576 My guess would be yes, Richard
4145600 4147852 I could see fiom my position here<br />the fienzy in his eyes
4147935 4149788 give way to the realization<br />of what he was doing.
4149812 4151624 I think any man would have<br />left the ring that fast.
4151648 4153208 Dan, do you feel that this tragedy
4153232 4154918 is gonna have an efi'ect<br />on the world of boxing?
4154942 4156253 Richard a tragedy like this
4156277 4158714 can't help but shake the world of boxing<br />to its very foundations,
4158738 4161050 but its of Paramount importance<br />that during the sad weeks ahead,
4161074 4163242 the eyes of the wba remain...
4198486 4202073 Marsellus?
4202156 4204742 I didn't do it, man. I didn't do it.
4204826 4206285 How you doing?
4206911 4209997 Great. I never thanked you for dinner.
4212625 4214210 - What you got?<br />- He booked.
4214293 4215461 His trainer?
4215545 4217630 Says he don't know nothing. I believe him.
4218214 4222468 - Think butch surprised his ass same as us.<br />- No, we don't wanna think, we wanna know.
4222552 4224846 Take him to the kennel,<br />sic the dogs on his ass.
4224929 4227640 We'll find out for goddamn sure<br />what he knows and what he don't.
4227724 4229404 Butch's search... how do you want it done?
4230017 4232770 I'm prepared to scour the earth<br />for that motherfucker.
4232854 4236149 If butch goes to indochina,<br />I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice,
4236232 4238151 ready to pop a cap in his ass.
4238901 4240945 I will take care of it.
4250872 4252206 Mister?
4256335 4257545 Hey, mister?
4257628 4258629 What?
4258713 4260506 You were in that fight?
4261090 4262717 The fight on the radio.
4263718 4265136 You're the fighter?
4265762 4267013 Now, what gave you that idea?
4267680 4269390 No, come on.
4270850 4271851 You're him.
4272977 4274437 I know you're him.
4276731 4277982 Tell me you're him.
4278065 4279734 I'm him.
4281110 4283279 You killed the other boxing man.
4287450 4288743 He's dead?
4289494 4291204 The radio said he was dead.
4294916 4296751 Sorry about that, Floyd.
4298211 4299879 What does it feel like?
4300713 4302548 What does what feel like?
4302632 4304091 Killing a man.
4306511 4310181 Beating another man to death<br />with your bare hands.
4311224 4313643 - Are you a weirdo?<br />- No.
4314352 4316979 It is a subject I have much interest in.
4319649 4323152 You are the first person<br />I have ever met who has killed somebody.
4328658 4331160 What does it feel like to kill a man?
4332578 4334038 I'll tell you what.
4334664 4336475 Give me one of them cigarettes<br />you got up there,
4336499 4337834 and I'll tell you all about it.
4358563 4359814 Esmarelda...
4361023 4362775 Villa lobos.
4363359 4364402 Is that Mexican?
4364485 4367697 The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian.
4367780 4369407 That's some handle you got there, honey.
4369490 4370908 Thank you.
4371909 4373077 And what is your name?
4373828 4374829 Butch.
4375496 4376747 Butch.
4377790 4378791 What does it mean?
4378875 4381419 I'm an American, honey.<br />Our names don't mean shit.
4382628 4387174 So, moving right along, esmarelda.
4387258 4389302 What is it you wanna know?
4389969 4392930 I want to know what it feels like<br />to kill a man.
4393014 4394223 I couldn't tell ya.
4400187 4402982 I didn't know he was dead<br />until you told me he was dead.
4404859 4407695 Now that I know he's dead,<br />you wanna know how I feel about it?
4413367 4415703 I don't feel the least bit bad about it.
4427423 4429926 What the fuck I tell ya? Huh?
4430009 4431889 As soon as the word got out<br />the fix was in, man,
4431928 4433387 the odds went through the roof.
4433471 4435640 I know. I know. Unbelievable.
4436223 4437266 Hey, fuck him, Scotty.
4437350 4439518 If he was a better boxer,<br />he'd still be alive.
4439602 4440882 If he never laced up his gloves,
4440937 4444017 which he never should've done in the first<br />fucking place, he'd still be alive.
4445816 4447109 Yeah, well...
4447777 4449862 Who gives a fuck? It's over now.
4449946 4452573 Yeah, well, enough about<br />the poor, unfortunate Mr. Floyd.
4452657 4455451 Let's talk about the rich<br />and prosperous Mr. Butch.
4456535 4458788 How many bookies you lay it around on?
4459580 4460957 All eight?
4461040 4462375 How long to collect?
4463709 4465795 So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?
4465878 4468255 No, I understand, a few stragglers aside.
4468339 4471842 Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.<br />That is great news, man.
4472468 4473886 Yeah. Mm-hmm.
4473970 4476597 No, me and fabienne<br />are gonna leave in the morning.
4476681 4479850 Yeah, it'll probably take us a couple days<br />to get down to Knoxville.
4479934 4481602 Okay, my brother.
4483187 4485439 You're right. You're goddamn right.
4486357 4487566 All right, Scotty.
4487650 4489860 Next time I see you,<br />we'll be on Tennessee time.
4489944 4491404 Be cool, brother.
4507586 4509296 45.60.
4513843 4518097 And, uh, here's a little something<br />for the effort.
4518180 4519223 Now...
4519932 4521732 If anybody asks you<br />who your fare was tonight,
4521809 4524270 - what are you gonna say?<br />- The truth.
4524353 4528190 Three well-dressed,<br />slightly toasted Mexicans.
4530276 4532528 Bonsoir, esmarelda villa lobos.
4532611 4534905 Buenas noches, butch.
4549879 4551464 Keep the light off.
4552339 4554550 - Is that better, sugar pop?<br />- Oui.
4559305 4561140 Hard day at the office?
4561223 4562349 Pretty hard.
4563225 4564602 I got in a fight.
4565352 4567104 Poor baby.
4567855 4569565 Can we make spoons?
4570357 4572377 You know what?<br />I was thinking about taking a shower.
4572401 4574361 I'm stinking like a dog over here.
4574445 4576405 I like the way you stink.
4577573 4579492 Let me take this jacket off.
4582036 4584288 I was looking at myself in the mirror.
4584371 4585623 Uh-huh?
4585706 4587500 I wish I had a pot.
4589168 4590848 You were looking at yourself<br />in the mirror,
4590878 4592338 and you wish you had some pot?
4594131 4595591 A pot belly.
4596300 4598010 Pot bellies are sexy.
4598636 4600513 Well, you should be happy...
4601847 4603015 'Cause you have one.
4603099 4604642 Shut up, fatso!
4604725 4606352 I don't have a pot.
4606435 4610189 I have a bit of a tummy,<br />like Madonna when she did "lucky star."
4610272 4611816 It's not the same thing.
4611899 4615069 I didn't know there was such a difference<br />between a pot belly and a tummy.
4615152 4617113 The difference is huge.
4619573 4621534 Would you like it if I had a pot belly?
4623661 4627248 Pot bellies make a man<br />look either oafish or like a gorilla.
4628124 4630918 But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy.
4631544 4632920 The rest of you is normal.
4633003 4635005 Normal face, normal legs,
4635089 4637424 normal hips, normal ass,
4637508 4640970 but with a big perfectly round pot belly.
4641720 4645766 If I had one, I'd wear a t-shirt<br />two sizes too small to accentuate it.
4645850 4648018 You think men would find that attractive?
4648769 4651230 I don't give a damn<br />what men find attractive.
4651939 4654150 It's unfortunate what we find pleasing<br />to the touch
4654233 4657111 and pleasing to the eye<br />is seldom the same.
4660739 4662241 If you had a pot belly,
4662867 4664368 I would punch you in it.
4664451 4666912 - You'd punch me in my belly?<br />- Right in the belly.
4668080 4669373 I'd smother you.
4669456 4671250 I'd drop it right on your face...
4671333 4673544 Till you couldn't breathe.
4673627 4676547 - You'd do that?<br />- Yes. Yes.
4691812 4692813 Did you get everything?
4693397 4694440 Yes, I did.
4694523 4696525 Good job, sugar pop.
4696609 4697860 Did everything go as planned?
4698694 4700362 You didn't listen to the... ow!
4701655 4704950 - You didn't listen to the radio?<br />- I never listen to your fights.
4705034 4706035 Were you the winner?
4706785 4708495 I won, all right.
4708579 4709914 Are you still retiring?
4709997 4711457 Sure am.
4712416 4713876 So, it all worked out in the finish?
4715502 4717588 We're not at the finish yet, baby.
4727056 4729308 We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?
4731352 4733938 If they find us,<br />they'll kill us, won't they?
4736440 4738275 But they won't find us, will they?
4742363 4744365 Do you still want me to go with you?
4746700 4749828 I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance.
4749912 4750996 It's...
4756961 4758504 Say it.
4759421 4761215 Fabienne,
4762091 4763884 I want you to be with me.
4765344 4766637 Forever?
4766720 4768180 Forever and ever.
4770432 4771809 Do you love me?
4772434 4774144 Very, very much.
4780276 4781735 Butch?
4781819 4782820 Yes.
4784196 4786699 Will you give me oral pleasure?
4788325 4789702 Will you kiss it?
4792204 4793580 But you first.
4794540 4796292 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
4807344 4808470 Butch.
4829116 4830993 I think I cracked a rib.
4831076 4833037 Giving me oral pleasure?
4833120 4834747 No, retard. From the fight.
4834830 4836165 Don't call me retard.
4836248 4837916 My name is fabby.
4838000 4841337 - My name is fabienne.<br />- Stop it. Stop it.
4841420 4843589 - My name is fabienne.<br />- Shut up, fuckhead!
4843672 4845507 I hate that mongoloid voice.
4845591 4847760 Okay. Sorry, sorry.
4848802 4850763 I take it back.
4853766 4856977 Would you hand me a dry towel,<br />miss beautiful tulip?
4857061 4858437 Oh, I like that.
4858520 4860689 I like being called a tulip.
4860773 4862983 Tulip is much better than mongoloid.
4863067 4864693 I didn't call you a mongoloid.
4864777 4867446 I called you a retard, and I took it back.
4869573 4870657 Butch?
4870741 4872493 Yes, lemon pie.
4872576 4874078 Where are we going to go?
4874161 4875621 Well, I'm not sure yet.
4876497 4877748 Wherever you want.
4878540 4882586 We're gonna get a lot of money from this,<br />but it ain't gonna be the kinda money
4882669 4885923 that we can live like hogs<br />in the fat house forever.
4886840 4890552 I was thinking maybe we could go down<br />some place in the south pacific.
4891261 4894431 The kinda money we're gonna have<br />is gonna carry us a long way down there.
4894515 4897559 - If we wanted, we could live in bora bora?<br />- You betcha.
4897643 4899937 And if after a while you didn't dig that,
4900020 4903524 go some place else, maybe Tahiti. Mexico.
4903607 4905317 But I do not speak Spanish.
4905401 4907945 Well, you do not speak bora-boran, either.
4908570 4910531 Besides, Mexican is easy.
4912616 4915411 - What does that mean?<br />- Where is the shoe store?
4915494 4917287 Spit, please.
4921041 4923168 Excellent pronunciation.
4925045 4927256 You'll be my little mamacita in no time.
4928549 4929883 Oué hora es?
4929967 4931093 Que hora es?
4931176 4933137 - "What time is it?"<br />- "What time is it?"
4933220 4934680 Time for bed.
4935889 4937683 Sweet dreams, jellybean.
4945691 4947025 Butch?
4953490 4954783 Never mind.
4965085 4967588 Merde. You startled me.
4967671 4969006 Did you have a bad dream?
4972468 4973552 Shit.
4979475 4981515 What is this you're watching?
4982311 4985397 A motorcycle movie. I'm not sure the name.
4987649 4988817 Are you watching it?
4989651 4991028 In a way.
4993155 4995991 It's a little early in the morning<br />for explosions and war.
4999495 5000496 What was it about?
5000579 5003179 How should I know, fabienne?<br />You were the one who was watching it.
5003207 5006043 No, imbecile,<br />what was your dream about?
5006126 5009338 I don't know. I don't remember.
5010547 5012341 It's really rare<br />that I remember my dreams.
5012424 5015802 Well, let's look at the grumpy man<br />in the morning.
5018096 5020849 Why don't you get up<br />and we'll get some breakfast?
5020933 5023101 One more kiss, and I'll get up.
5025437 5027105 Satisfied?
5027189 5029316 Yep.
5029399 5033737 Then get up, lazy bones.
5033820 5035697 God.
5037199 5038575 What time is it?
5038659 5040744 Almost 9:00 in the morning.
5040827 5042788 What time does our train arrive?
5042871 5043872 11:00.
5044498 5046458 You know what I'm gonna<br />have for breakfast?
5046542 5047834 What, lemon pie?
5049169 5051755 I'm gonna order a big plate
5051838 5055092 of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup.
5055175 5058554 Eggs over easy, and five sausages.
5059346 5060889 Anything to drink with that?
5060973 5064601 Ah, that looks nice.
5064685 5065936 To drink,
5066019 5070482 a tall glass of orange juice<br />and a black cup of coffee.
5070566 5073068 After that,<br />I'm going to have a slice of pie.
5073151 5075279 Pie for breakfast?
5075362 5078907 Any time of the day<br />is a good time for pie.
5078991 5081577 Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes.
5081660 5085122 And on top, a thin<br />slice of melted cheese...
5085205 5086582 Where's my watch?
5091878 5093171 It's there.
5093964 5095215 No, it's not.
5095966 5097217 Have you looked?
5097301 5099970 Yes, I fucking looked.<br />What the fuck do you think I'm doing?
5101138 5102347 You sure you got it?
5103849 5105517 Yes. Bedside table drawer.
5105601 5108729 - On the little kangaroo?<br />- Yes. It was on the little kangaroo.
5108812 5111148 Yeah, well, it's not here now.
5113025 5114901 Well, it should be.
5114985 5117696 Yes, it most definitely should be,<br />but it's not here now.
5117779 5118780 So where the fuck is it?
5124453 5125871 Fabienne,
5125954 5127831 that was my father's fucking watch.
5130167 5133128 Do you have any idea of what he had<br />to go through to get me that watch?
5133795 5136115 I don't have time to go into it,<br />but he went through a lot.
5136173 5138013 Now, all this other shit<br />you could set on fire,
5138050 5142179 but I specifically reminded you<br />not to forget the fucking watch!
5143013 5145432 Now think. Did you get it?
5146308 5147309 I believe so.
5147392 5149152 You believe so?<br />What the fuck does that mean?
5149186 5150666 You either did, or you didn't get it!
5152731 5153982 Then I did.
5156193 5157277 Are you sure?
5162574 5164368 Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
5164451 5166787 Motherfucker! Motherfucker!
5168163 5171208 Do you know how fucking stupid<br />you fucking are?
5176171 5177798 It's not your fault.
5183095 5185097 If you left<br />it at the apartment...
5191269 5193730 If you left it at the apartment,<br />it's not your fault.
5196650 5198276 I had you bring a bunch of stuff.
5201988 5205158 I reminded you about it,<br />but I didn't illustrate
5205242 5207035 how personal the watch was to me.
5208453 5210163 If all I gave a fuck about was the watch,
5210247 5211456 I should've told you that.
5213166 5214459 You're not a mind reader,
5215711 5216712 are you?
5227597 5229182 I'm... I'm sorry.
5229766 5232853 Don't be. It just means<br />I can't have breakfast with you.
5234229 5235647 Why does it mean that?
5238650 5242446 Because I got to go back to my apartment<br />and get my watch.
5243113 5245866 Won't the gangsters<br />be looking for you there?
5245949 5248660 Well, that's what I'm going to find out.
5249703 5251037 If they are,
5251121 5252914 and I don't think I can handle it,
5252998 5254082 then I'll split.
5254166 5256835 I saw your watch. I thought I brought it.
5257961 5259296 I'm so sorry.
5265427 5266553 Here's some money.
5266636 5268930 Go out and get those pancakes.<br />Have a nice breakfast.
5269806 5272601 I'll take your Honda. I'll be back<br />before you can say blueberry pie.
5272684 5274019 Blueberry pie.
5275812 5277063 Maybe not that fast,
5278148 5280734 - but pretty fast, okay?<br />- Okay.
5281443 5282944 - Bye.<br />- Bye.
5283570 5286198 Shit! Of all the fucking things<br />she could fucking forget,
5286281 5288200 she forgets my father's watch!
5288283 5290160 I specifically reminded her.
5290243 5292704 "Bedside table, on the kangaroo."
5292788 5296041 I said the words,<br />"don't forget my father's watch."

5711414 5712707 That guy was a drunken maniac.

5790451 5792161 Hold it right there, goddamn it.
5792245 5794163 This ain't none of your business, mister.
5794247 5797125 I'm making it my business.<br />Toss the weapon.
5797750 5800420 - You don't understand, man.<br />- Toss the weapon.
5807635 5809262 Take your foot off the nigger.
5809345 5811055 Put your hands behind your head.
5811681 5813391 Approach the counter right now.
5813474 5816519 This motherfucker's trying to kill me.
5816602 5817770 Shut up.

5901687 5903356 except me or zed.
5907235 5908444 That's zed.
5922041 5923721 I thought you said<br />you waited for me.
5923751 5924836 I did.
5930633 5932510 So how come they're all beat up?
5933761 5936806 They did that to each other,<br />man. They came in fighting.
5937557 5938891 Now, this one right here,
5939559 5941477 he was going to shoot that one.
5941561 5944647 Is that right?<br />You were going to shoot him, boy?
5945815 5946816 Huh?

6417369 6418579 What now?
6420456 6421957 Let me tell you what now.
6424084 6427087 I'm going to call a couple of hard<br />pipe-hitting niggers
6427171 6429048 to go to work on the homes here
6429673 6432092 with a pair of pliers and a blow torch.
6434887 6437473 You hear me talking, hillbilly boy?
6438891 6441310 I ain't through with you by a damn sight.
6441393 6443604 I'm going to get medieval on your ass.
6447816 6450110 I meant what now between me and you.
6455866 6457284 Oh, that what now.

6480140 6481934 Two things...

6488482 6491944 This shit is between me, you,
6492027 6496448 and Mr. "soon to be living the rest<br />of his short-ass life in agonizing pain"
6496532 6497950 rapist here.
6499910 6501912 It ain't nobody else's business.
6502746 6503747 Two,
6504581 6508252 you leave town tonight, right now.
6509420 6512506 And when you're gone, you stay gone,

6516093 6518721 You lost all your la privileges. Deal?
6521515 6522516 Deal.

6595756 6597257 Fabienne.
6597341 6599569 Come on, baby, come on. Get your shit.<br />We got to go right now.
6599593 6601571 Butch, I was so worried.<br />What about our bags?
6601595 6603573 Fuck the bags.<br />If we don't split right now,
6603597 6605784 we're going to miss the train.<br />Come on. I'll be downstairs.
6605808 6608852 - Is everything well?<br />- Just come on! No talking now.
6608936 6610521 Are we in danger?
6614399 6615526 Come on, honey!
6619196 6620864 Where did you get this motorcycle?
6620948 6624159 It's not a motorcycle, baby.<br />It's a chopper. Come on, let's go.
6624243 6625452 What happened to my Honda?
6625536 6628038 I'm sorry, baby.<br />I had to crash that Honda.
6628122 6630124 Will you come on now, please?
6630207 6632209 Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.
6636463 6637548 You're hurt?

6641343 6644471 Baby, please, we got...<br />Honey, we got to hit the fucking road.
6644555 6645556 Get on.
6648433 6650936 I'm sorry. Come here, come here.
6651019 6652020 I'm sorry.
6653188 6654189 I'm so sorry.
6654273 6657151 You were gone so long<br />I started to think dreadful thoughts.
6657234 6659278 Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.<br />I didn't mean to worry you.
6659361 6660922 Everything's fine. How was your breakfast?
6660946 6662423 - It was good.<br />- Did you get the pancakes?
6662447 6664801 - The blueberry pancakes?<br />- They didn't have blueberry pancakes.
6664825 6667161 I had to get buttermilk.<br />Are you sure you're okay?
6667244 6668704 Honey, since I left you it has...
6668787 6669947 This has been without a doubt
6669997 6671957 the single weirdest<br />fucking day of my life.
6672040 6673726 Come on, hop on.<br />I'll tell you all about it.
6673750 6676128 Come on, get on.<br />Gotta go, gotta go. Come on.
6677004 6678755 Butch, whose motorcycle is this?
6678839 6680174 It's a chopper, baby.
6680257 6681592 Whose chopper is this?
6681675 6683552 - Zed's.<br />- Who's zed?
6683635 6685053 Zed's dead, baby.
6685679 6686847 Zed's dead.
6702613 6704698 Yes, you did, Brett!
6704781 6706676 - You tried to fuck him.<br />- No.
6706700 6709953 And marsellus Wallace<br />don't like to be fucked by anybody
6710037 6712706 - except Mrs. Wallace.<br />- Oh, god, please. I don't want to die.
6712789 6715417 - You read the Bible, Brett?<br />- Yes!
6715500 6717878 Well, there's<br />this passage I got memorized.
6717961 6719755 It sort of fits the occasion.
6719838 6722341 Ezekiel 25:17.
6723342 6725594 "The path of the righteous man
6725677 6727638 is beset on all sides
6727721 6729723 by the inequities of the selfish
6729806 6732184 and the tyranny of evil men.
6732935 6734603 Blessed is he
6734686 6737731 who in the name of charity and good will
6737814 6740817 Shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness,
6740901 6743487 for he is truly his brother's keeper
6743570 6746281 and the finder of lost children."
6746365 6749159 "And I will strike down upon thee
6749243 6752955 with great vengeance and furious anger
6753038 6755332 those who attempt to poison
6755415 6757334 and destroy my brothers.
6757417 6761421 And you will know my name is the lord
6761505 6764716 when I lay my vengeance upon thee."
6772808 6774476 I'm fucked. I'm fucked.
6774559 6775602 I'm fucked.
6775686 6777896 - Is he a friend of yours?<br />- Oh, god...
6777980 6780315 Hmm? Oh, Vincent, Marvin.<br />Marvin, Vincent.
6780399 6782126 Better tell him<br />to shut the fuck up.
6782150 6784528 - He's getting on my nerves.<br />- Marvin. Marvin.
6784611 6785654 Marvin!
6785737 6787906 I'd knock that shit off if I was you.
6787990 6790617 Die, you motherfuckers!
6790701 6791910 Die!
6820105 6823233 Why the fuck didn't you tell us<br />somebody was in the bathroom?
6823317 6824651 Slip your mind?
6824735 6827779 Did you forget that someone was in there<br />with a goddamn hand-Cannon?
6827863 6830282 You see the size<br />of that gun he fired at us?
6830365 6831616 It was bigger than him.
6837289 6839166 We should be fucking dead, man.
6839958 6841668 I know. We was lucky.
6841752 6844379 No, no, no, no. That shit wasn't luck.
6844463 6845839 Yeah, maybe.
6847090 6849176 This was divine intervention.
6849259 6851261 You know what divine intervention is?
6857851 6859436 I think so.
6859519 6862564 That means that god came down from heaven<br />and stopped the bullets.
6862647 6865067 That's right.<br />That's exactly what it means.
6865150 6868111 God came down from heaven<br />and stopped these motherfucking bullets.
6869404 6871323 I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.
6871406 6873784 Don't do that.<br />Don't fucking blow this shit off.
6873867 6875952 What just happened here<br />was a fucking miracle.
6876036 6877829 Chill, Jules. This shit happens.
6877913 6881416 Wrong. Wrong.<br />This shit doesn't just happen.
6881500 6884836 Do you want to continue<br />this theological discussion in a car?
6884920 6886505 Or in a jailhouse with the cops?
6886588 6888423 We should be fucking dead, my friend.
6889341 6893678 What happened here was a miracle,<br />and I want you to fucking acknowledge it.
6893762 6895680 All right, it was a miracle.
6896848 6897849 Can we go now?
6905690 6907067 Let's go, nigger. Come on.
6907859 6908860 Shit.
6911571 6913091 You ever seen that show cops?
6913115 6915468 Well, I was watching it one time,<br />and there was this cop on,
6915492 6919287 and he was talking about this gunfight<br />he had in a hallway with this guy, right?
6919371 6921998 And he just unloaded on this guy<br />and nothing happened.
6922082 6925085 He didn't hit nothing.<br />Okay? It was just him and this guy.
6925794 6927254 I mean, you know...
6927337 6929506 It's freaky, but it happens.
6929589 6932050 Look, you want to play blind man,<br />go walk with the Shepherd.
6932134 6934511 But me, my eyes are wide fucking open.
6934594 6936304 What the fuck does that mean?
6936388 6938014 It means that's it for me.
6938098 6940267 From here on in, you can<br />consider my ass retired.
6940350 6941953 - Jesus Christ.<br />- Don't blaspheme.
6941977 6943417 - Goddamn it.<br />- I said don't do that.
6943478 6945647 You know, why are you<br />fucking freaking out on us?
6945730 6948275 Look, I'm telling marsellus today.<br />I'm through.
6948358 6950444 Well, why don't you tell him<br />at the same time why?
6950527 6951528 Don't worry. I will.
6951611 6954072 Yeah, and I'll bet you $10,000<br />he laughs his ass off.
6954156 6955866 I don't give a damn if he does.
6956616 6959661 Marvin, what do you make of all this?
6959744 6961538 Man, I don't even have an opinion.
6961621 6963248 Well, you got to have an opinion.
6963331 6965931 I mean, do you think that god<br />came down from heaven and stopped...
6966543 6969754 - What the fuck's happening? Shit, man!<br />- Ah, man!
6969838 6971548 Ah, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
6971631 6972799 Why the fuck did you do that?
6972883 6974777 Well, I didn't mean to do it.<br />It was an accident.
6974801 6977196 Oh, man, I've seen some<br />crazy-ass shit in my time, but this...
6977220 6978990 Chill out, man.<br />I told you it was an accident.
6979014 6980950 You probably...<br />You went over a bump or something.
6980974 6982702 Hey, the car didn't hit<br />no motherfucking bump.
6982726 6985103 Hey, look, man, I didn't mean<br />to shoot the son of a bitch.
6985187 6986605 The gun went off. I don't know why.
6986688 6988166 Well, look at this fucking mess, man!
6988190 6989792 We're on a city street in broad daylight.
6989816 6992003 - I can't believe it, man.<br />- Well, believe it now, motherfucker.
6992027 6994630 We got to get this car off the road.<br />You know, cops tend to notice shit
6994654 6996694 like you're driving a car<br />drenched in fucking blood.
6996740 6998468 Just take it to<br />a friendly place, that's all.
6998492 7000970 This is the valley, Vincent.<br />Marsellus ain't got no friendly places.
7000994 7002871 Well, Jules, this ain't<br />my fucking town, man!
7002954 7003955 Shit!
7004581 7006875 - What you doing?<br />- I'm calling my partner in toluca lake.
7006958 7007959 Where's toluca lake?
7008043 7010462 It's just over the hill here,<br />over by Burbank studios.
7011129 7012339 If jimmie's ass ain't home,
7012422 7013858 I don't know what the fuck<br />we going to do, man,
7013882 7016009 because I ain't got<br />no other partners in 818.
7016968 7019346 Jimmie, yo, how you doing, man?<br />It's Jules.
7019429 7020597 Just listen up, man.
7020680 7022825 Me and my homeboy<br />are in some serious fucking shit, man.
7022849 7024827 We're in a car, and we got<br />to get off the road pronto.
7024851 7026770 I need to use your garage<br />for a couple hours.
7028146 7031191 We got to be real fucking delicate<br />with this jimmie situation, you know.
7031274 7033568 He's one remark away<br />from kicking our asses out the door.
7033652 7034962 If he does, what do we do?
7034986 7037656 Well, we ain't leaving<br />until we made a couple calls,
7037739 7039258 but I don't want it to reach that pitch.
7039282 7040322 I mean, jimmie's a friend.
7040367 7043054 You don't come into your friend's house<br />and start telling him what's what.
7043078 7044972 Well, just tell him<br />not to be abusive, that's all.
7044996 7047791 I mean, he kind of freaked out back there<br />when he saw Marvin.
7047874 7049268 Well, put yourself in his position.
7049292 7050603 I mean, it's 8:00 in the morning.
7050627 7052879 He just woke up.<br />He wasn't expecting this shit.
7052963 7055715 I mean, shit, we got to remember here<br />who's doing who a favor.
7055799 7057801 Well, if that favor means<br />that I got to take shit,
7057884 7060387 then he can stick that favor<br />straight up his ass. I don't care.
7060470 7063110 Hey, fuck, nigger. What the fuck did you<br />just do to his towel, man?
7063139 7065576 - I was drying my hands.<br />- Well, you're supposed to wash them first.
7065600 7068103 - Well, you watched me wash them.<br />- I watched you get them wet.
7068186 7070772 I was washing them.<br />This shit's hard to get off.
7070855 7072792 Maybe if he had lava,<br />I could've done a betterjob.
7072816 7074317 I used the same fucking soap you did,
7074401 7077153 and when I finished, the towel didn't look<br />like no goddamn maxi pad.
7077237 7080007 Now, what if he was to come in here<br />and see his towel like this, Vincent?
7080031 7083285 It's shit like this that's going<br />to bring this situation to a head, man.
7085161 7088623 Look... I ain't threatening you<br />with nothing, all right?
7088707 7090542 You know I respect you and all,
7090625 7093211 but just don't put me<br />in this position, all right?
7093295 7095964 All right. Fine. Fine.
7096047 7098008 Ask me nice like that, no problem.
7098925 7101803 Just go handle your friend.<br />Go ahead. I don't care.
7103555 7106516 Mmm. Goddamn, jimmie.
7106600 7108560 This is some serious gourmet shit.
7108643 7110562 Me and Vincent would've been satisfied
7110645 7113940 with some freeze-dried<br />taster's choice, right?
7114024 7117068 And he Springs<br />this serious gourmet shit on us.
7117152 7119738 - What flavor is this?<br />- Knock it off, Julie.
7119821 7120947 What?
7121031 7123908 I don't need you to tell me<br />how fucking good my coffee is, okay?
7123992 7126286 I'm the one who buys it.<br />I know how good it is.
7126369 7128413 When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.
7128496 7130206 I buy the gourmet expensive stuff
7130290 7132167 because when I drink it,<br />I want to taste it.
7132250 7134044 But you know what's on my mind right now?
7134127 7136254 It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.
7136338 7138381 It's the dead nigger in my garage.
7138465 7140234 - Oh, jimmie, don't even worry about it.<br />- No, no, no.
7140258 7142820 Don't tell me don't think about anything.<br />I want to ask you a question.
7142844 7145781 When you came pulling in here, did you<br />notice a sign out in the front of my house
7145805 7147140 that said "dead nigger storage"?
7147223 7148933 Jimmie, you know I didn't see no shit...
7149017 7151019 Did you notice a sign<br />in the front of my house
7151102 7152646 that said "dead nigger storage"?
7153521 7155732 No. I didn't.
7155815 7158443 - You know why you didn't see that sign?<br />- Why?
7158526 7160463 'Cause it ain't there,<br />'cause storing dead niggers
7160487 7163073 ain't my fucking business, that's why!
7163156 7166276 - Jimmie, we're not going to store...<br />- No, no. Don't you fucking realize, man,
7166326 7169329 that if Bonnie comes home<br />and finds a dead body in her house,
7169412 7170580 I'm going to get divorced?
7170664 7172683 All right? No marriage counselor,<br />no trial separation.
7172707 7176753 I'm going to get fucking divorced, okay?<br />And I don't want to get fucking divorced.
7177379 7180131 Now, man, you know, fuck.<br />I mean, I want to help you.
7180215 7182384 But I don't want to lose<br />my wife doing it, all right?
7182467 7184552 Jimmie, jimmie,<br />she ain't going to leave you.
7184636 7186471 Don't fucking "jimmie" me, Jules!
7186554 7188932 Okay? Don't fucking “jimmie" me.
7189015 7190495 There's nothing that you're gonna say
7190558 7193311 that's going to make me forget<br />that I love my wife, is there?
7194521 7196815 Now, look, you know,
7196898 7199943 she comes home from work<br />in about an hour and a half.
7200610 7203154 Graveyard shift at the hospital.
7203238 7206783 You got to make some phone calls?<br />You got to call some people?
7206866 7209577 Well, then do it, and then<br />get the fuck out of my house
7209661 7210870 before she gets here.
7210954 7212205 Hey, that's kool and the gang.
7212288 7213974 You know, we don't want<br />to fuck your shit up.
7213998 7216769 All I want to do is call my people,<br />get them to bring us in, that's all.
7216793 7219671 You don't want to fuck my shit up?<br />You're fucking my shit up right now.
7219754 7222507 You're going to fuck my shit up big time<br />if Bonnie comes home.
7222590 7224426 So just do me that favor, all right?
7224509 7226529 The phone is in my bedroom.<br />I suggest you get going.
7226553 7228680 Well, say she comes home,
7229681 7231099 what do you think she'll do?
7233393 7235895 Oh, no fucking shit, she'll freak.
7235979 7237647 That ain't no kind of answer.
7238273 7241317 I mean, you know, I don't.<br />How much? A lot or a little?
7241401 7244612 You got to appreciate<br />what an explosive element
7244696 7246239 this Bonnie situation is.
7246322 7248575 I mean, if she comes home<br />fiom a hard days work
7248658 7250418 and finds a bunch<br />of gangsters in her kitchen
7250452 7252078 doing a bunch of gangster shit,
7252162 7254372 there ain't no telling<br />what she's liable to do.
7257584 7259461 Yeah, I've grasped that, Jules.
7260128 7262172 All I'm doing is contemplating the "ifs."
7262255 7264382 I don't want to hear about<br />no motherfucking “ifs."
7264466 7267343 All I want to hear from your ass is,<br />"you ain't got no problem, Jules.
7267427 7268803 I'm on the motherfucker.
7268887 7270527 Go back in there, chill them niggers out,
7270555 7273391 and wait for the cavalry,<br />which should be coming directly."
7273475 7275769 You ain't got no problem, Jules.
7276603 7278188 I'm on the motherfucker.
7278980 7280940 Go back in there and<br />chill them niggers out
7281608 7283985 and wait for the wolf,<br />who should be coming directly.
7285153 7286488 You're sending the wolf?
7287197 7288740 You feel better, motherfucker?
7289407 7293161 Shit, negro, that's all you had to say.
7294370 7296372 Is she the hysterical type?
7297707 7299209 When is she due?
7299292 7300835 Bank six, dianne.
7300919 7304631 Mm-hmm.<br />Give me the principals' names again.
7304714 7305924 Place your bets.
7307842 7309135 Jules.
7310428 7314098 Mm-hmm. Vincent.
7315391 7316392 Bank?
7317644 7320104 - Bank wins...<br />- Jimmie.
7321272 7324275 - Place a bet.<br />- Bonnie. Mm-hmm.
7328321 7330114 It's 30 minutes away.
7330198 7331198 I'll be there in ten.
7348883 7351636 You're jimmie, right? This is your house?
7351719 7352762 Sure is.
7352846 7355473 I'm Winston wolf. I solve problems.
7355557 7356766 Good. We got one.
7356850 7358268 So I heard. May I come in?
7358351 7359394 Yeah, please do.
7360562 7364274 You must be Jules,<br />which would make you Vincent.
7364357 7366526 Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.
7366609 7367711 If I was informed correctly,
7367735 7369455 the clock is ticking,<br />is that right, jimmie?
7369529 7370655 Uh, 100%.
7370738 7374576 Your wife, Bonnie, comes home<br />at 9:30 in the am, is that correct?
7374659 7375660 Uh-huh.
7375743 7378413 I was led to believe<br />if she comes home and finds us here,
7378496 7380248 she wouldn't appreciate it none too much?
7380331 7381416 You wouldn't bet.
7381499 7384669 All right, that gives us 40 minutes<br />to get the fuck out of dodge,
7384752 7387922 which, if you do what I say when I say it,<br />should be plenty.
7388006 7392594 Now, you got a corpse in a car<br />minus a head in a garage. Take me to it.
7400435 7402061 - Jimmie?<br />- Uh-huh?
7402687 7404022 Do me a favor, will you?
7404105 7405666 I thought I smelled<br />some coffee back there.
7405690 7406816 Would you make me a cup?
7407692 7409319 Uh, yeah, sure.
7411112 7413656 Oh, um, how do you take it?
7413740 7415283 Lots of cream, lots of sugar.
7418870 7420598 About the car, is there<br />anything I need to know?
7420622 7422999 Does it stall, does it smoke,<br />does it make a lot of noise?
7423082 7424584 Is there gas in it? Anything?
7424667 7426628 Aside from how it looks, the car is cool.
7427420 7429589 Positive? Don't get me<br />out there on the road,
7429672 7431232 I find out the brake lights don't work.
7431257 7433801 Hey, man, far as I know,<br />the motherfucker's tip-top.
7434802 7435845 Good enough.
7436679 7438556 Let's go back to the kitchen.
7444395 7445438 Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
7445521 7446606 Thank you, jimmie.
7452362 7453446 Mmm.
7455031 7456658 Okay. First thing.
7456741 7459452 You two, take the body,<br />stick it in the trunk.
7459535 7462163 Now, jimmie, this looks to be<br />a pretty domesticated house.
7462246 7464475 That would lead me to believe<br />in the garage or under the sink,
7464499 7466226 you got a bunch of cleaners<br />and shit like that.
7466250 7468086 - Yeah, Mr. Wolf. Under the sink.<br />- Good.
7468169 7470522 What I need you two fellas to do<br />is take those cleaning products
7470546 7471965 and clean the inside of the car.
7472048 7473883 I'm talking fast, fast, fast.
7473967 7475426 You need to go in the back seat,
7475510 7478554 scoop up all those little pieces<br />of brain and skull.
7478638 7480640 Get it out of there.<br />Wipe down the upholstery.
7480723 7483410 Now, when it comes to upholstery,<br />it don't need to be spick-and-span.
7483434 7486270 You don't need to eat off it.<br />Just give it a good once-over.
7486354 7488982 What you need to take care of<br />are the really messy parts.
7489065 7492068 The pools of blood that have collected,<br />you got to soak that shit up.
7492151 7493152 Now, jimmie,
7493903 7495488 we need to raid your linen closet.
7495571 7496990 I need blankets. I need comforters.
7497073 7498783 I need quilts. I need bedspreads.
7498866 7500511 The thicker the better,<br />the darker the better.
7500535 7502453 No whites. Can't use 'em.
7502537 7504789 We need to camouflage<br />the interior of the car.
7504872 7507750 We're going to line the front seat<br />and the back seat and the floorboards
7507834 7509377 with quilts and blankets.
7509460 7510503 So if a cop stops us
7510586 7512346 and starts sticking<br />his big snout in the car,
7512422 7513840 the subterfuge won't last,
7513923 7515925 but at a glance,<br />the car will appear to be normal.
7516843 7519554 Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work.
7519637 7520638 A "please" would be nice.
7521973 7522974 Come again?
7523057 7525059 I said a "please" would be nice.
7527061 7529230 Get it straight, buster.<br />I'm not here to say "please."
7529313 7530815 I'm here to tell you what to do.
7532108 7534569 And if self-preservation<br />is an instinct you possess,
7534652 7536529 you better fucking do it and do it quick.
7538031 7539198 I'm here to help.
7539282 7541993 If my help is not appreciated,<br />lots of luck, gentlemen.
7542076 7543716 No, no, no, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that.
7543786 7546414 - Your help is definitely appreciated.<br />- Mr. Wolf, listen.
7546497 7548916 I don't mean disrespect, okay?<br />I respect you.
7549000 7551294 I just don't like people<br />barking orders at me, that's all.
7551377 7554213 If I'm curt with you,<br />it's because time is a factor.
7554297 7556174 I think fast, I talk fast,
7556257 7559302 and I need you guys to act fast<br />if you want to get out of this.
7559385 7561345 So pretty please with sugar on top,
7561429 7562597 clean the fucking car.
7567226 7568978 Don't be looking at me<br />like that, all right?
7569062 7570271 I can feel your look.
7573524 7575735 It's a 1974 Chevy nova.
7578237 7579280 Green.
7581908 7583701 Nothing except for the mess inside.
7587246 7589207 Mmm, about 20 minutes.
7590958 7592418 Nobody who'll be missed.
7594962 7596631 You're a good man, Joe.
7596714 7597799 Thanks a bunch.
7599008 7600093 How we coming, jimmie?
7600176 7602303 Uh, pretty good.<br />I got... I got it all here,
7602386 7604222 but, uh...
7604305 7605945 Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.
7605973 7607642 Winston, jimmie, please. Winston.
7607725 7608726 Okay.
7608810 7611395 You gotta<br />understand something now, Winston.
7611479 7613397 Uh, no, thank you.
7613481 7616567 Uh, this is our best linen here,
7616651 7618194 and it's a...
7618277 7621489 It was a wedding present<br />from my uncle Conrad and my aunt Ginny,
7621572 7622990 and they're not with us anymore.
7623074 7626234 - And I really want to help you guys out...<br />- Let me ask you a question, jimmie.
7626786 7629372 - If you don't mind.<br />- No, no, please, please. Go ahead.
7631207 7634085 Your uncle Conrad and aunt Ginny,
7634836 7636003 were they millionaires?
7638673 7640508 Well, your uncle marsellus is,
7641634 7644762 and I'm positive if<br />uncle Conrad and aunt...
7645429 7647682 - Ginny.<br />- Ginny were here,
7647765 7651227 they would furnish you<br />with a whole bedroom set,
7652061 7654564 which your uncle marsellus<br />is more than happy to do.
7659152 7660444 I like oak myself.
7660528 7662947 That's what I have in my bedroom.
7664198 7665449 How about you, jimmie?
7667493 7668536 You an oak man?
7670371 7671497 Oak's nice.
7678296 7680131 Oh, man.
7680214 7682091 I will never forgive your ass<br />for this shit.
7682175 7684260 This is some fucked-up repugnant shit.
7684343 7687680 Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy<br />that once a man admits that he is wrong
7687763 7690224 that he is immediately<br />forgiven for all wrongdoings?
7690308 7691350 Have you ever heard that?
7691434 7693060 Get the fuck out my face with that shit.
7693144 7694395 The motherfucker said that shit
7694478 7697565 never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces<br />of skull on account of your dumb ass.
7697648 7698774 I got a threshold, Jules.
7698858 7700943 I got a threshold for<br />the abuse that I will take.
7701027 7702987 Now, right now,<br />I'm a fucking race car, all right?
7703029 7704882 And you got me in the red.<br />And I'm just saying...
7704906 7706657 I'm just saying<br />that it's fucking dangerous
7706741 7709035 to have a race car in<br />the fucking red, that's all.
7709118 7710119 I could blow.
7710203 7712203 - Oh, you ready to blow?<br />- Yeah, I'm ready to blow.
7712246 7715082 Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-laying<br />motherfucker, motherfucker.
7715166 7716792 Every time my fingers touch brain,
7716876 7720213 I'm super fly t.N.T.<br />I'm the guns of the navarone.
7720296 7722632 In fact, what the fuck<br />am I doing in the back?
7722715 7724926 You the motherfucker who<br />should be on brain detail.
7725009 7726010 We fucking switching.
7726093 7728721 I'm washing the windows,<br />and you picking up this nigger's skull.
7738898 7740233 Fine job, gentlemen.
7741901 7743694 We may get out of this yet.
7743778 7745613 I can't believe this is the same car.
7746489 7749533 Well, let's not start<br />sucking each other's dicks quite yet.
7750201 7751744 Phase one is complete, clean the car,
7751827 7753579 which moves us right along to phase two.
7753663 7754789 Clean you two.
7758167 7759168 Strip.
7759252 7760670 All the way?
7760753 7762046 To your bare ass.
7763089 7764674 Quickly, gentlemen.
7765299 7766384 We got about 15 minutes
7766467 7769303 before jimmie's better half<br />comes pulling into the driveway.
7769387 7771806 Damn. This morning air<br />is some chilly shit.
7771889 7773724 Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
7773808 7775268 You know what you two look like?
7775351 7776352 What?
7776435 7778635 Like a couple of guys<br />who just blew off somebody's head.
7779939 7783192 Stripping off those bloody rags<br />is absolutely necessary.
7787488 7789407 Toss them in Jim's garbage bag.
7789490 7791826 Don't do nothing stupid,<br />like leaving this shit out front
7791909 7794412 for Otto the garbageman to pick up,<br />you know what I'm saying?
7794495 7796414 Don't worry. We're taking it with us.
7796497 7798165 Jim, the soap.
7800459 7802712 - Vincent.<br />- Okay, gentlemen,
7802795 7805715 you've both been to county before,<br />I'm sure. Here it comes.
7805798 7808301 - Goddamn! The water's fucking cold.<br />- Oh!
7808384 7810094 Better you than me, gentlemen.
7812638 7815016 Don't be afraid of the soap.<br />Spread it around.
7815099 7816785 Get him up there a little bit.
7816809 7818249 - Vincent's hair.<br />- Shit out my hair.
7818311 7820021 Come on, do it, goddamn it. Do it!
7820104 7821147 Uh, uh...
7822106 7823232 Towel 'em.
7834618 7836778 They're dry enough.<br />Toss them their clothes.
7839707 7840958 Perfect.
7841042 7843377 Perfect. We couldn't<br />have planned this better.
7844670 7845921 You guys look like...
7847089 7848632 What do they look like, jimmie?
7849342 7850384 Dorks.
7851260 7852928 They look like a couple of dorks.
7853721 7856223 Ha-ha-ha.<br />They're your clothes, motherfucker.
7856307 7859101 Come on, gentlemen.<br />We're laughing our way right into prison.
7859185 7860311 Don't make me beg.
7864190 7867485 Okay, gentlemen,<br />let's get our rules of the road straight.
7867568 7870071 We're going to a place<br />called monster Joe's truck and tow.
7870821 7874158 Now, monster Joe and his daughter Raquel<br />are sympathetic to our dilemma.
7874241 7876327 The place is north Hollywood,
7876410 7877912 so a few twists and turns aside,
7877995 7879413 we'll be going up Hollywood way.
7880331 7882541 Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
7882625 7883626 Jules, you ride with me.
7883709 7884919 Mm-hmm.
7885002 7886962 Vincent, you follow in my acura.
7887046 7891050 Now, if we come across<br />the path of any John q. Laws,
7891133 7893135 nobody does a fucking thing<br />until I do something.
7893219 7894762 - Right.<br />- What did I say?
7895429 7896972 Don't do shit unless.
7897056 7898182 Unless what?
7898265 7899475 Unless you do it first.
7899558 7901894 Spoken like a true prodigy.
7901977 7903104 How about you, lash la rue?
7903187 7905606 Can you keep your spurs<br />from jingling and jangling?
7905689 7907274 Mr. Wolf, look, the gun went off.
7907358 7909652 I don't why. I'm cool. I promise you.
7909735 7910778 Fair enough.
7910861 7913030 Now, I drive real fucking fast,<br />so keep up.
7913114 7915449 If I get my car back<br />any different than I gave it,
7915533 7918202 monster Joe's going<br />to be disposing of two bodies.
7921831 7923082 Out of my way, Rex.
7925459 7927837 - We cool?<br />- Like it never happened.
7928629 7929630 All right.
7929713 7931715 Boys, this is Raquel.
7931799 7933759 Someday, all this will be hers.
7933843 7937221 Hi. So, what's with the outfits?
7937304 7939640 You guys going<br />to a volleyball game or something?
7942143 7944145 I'm taking my lady out for breakfast.
7944228 7946123 Maybe I could drop you two off.<br />Where do you live?
7946147 7947523 - Redondo.<br />- Inglewood.
7947606 7951026 It's... it's your future. I...
7951110 7953446 I see a... a cab ride.
7954196 7955906 Move out of the sticks, fellas.
7955990 7957199 Say good night, Raquel.
7957283 7958451 Good night, Raquel.
7958534 7959910 I'll see you guys around.
7959994 7961745 Stay out of trouble, you crazy kids.
7961829 7965666 Mr. Wolf, I just want to tell you<br />it was a real pleasure watching you work.
7965749 7968127 Yeah, really, and thank you<br />very much, Mr. Wolf.
7969920 7971130 Call me Winston.
7973007 7976051 You see that, young lady? Respect.
7976135 7980389 - Respect for one's elders shows character.<br />- I have character.
7980473 7982224 Because you are a character
7982308 7984268 doesn't mean that you have character.
7992401 7993569 Wanna share a cab?
7993652 7995922 You know, I could go for some breakfast.
7995946 7997531 Feel like having breakfast with me?
7998407 7999617 Cool.
8005039 8006040 I don't know why,
8006123 8008268 I just thought he'd be European<br />or something, because he...
8008292 8010544 Yo, man, he's about as<br />European as fucking English Bob.
8010628 8012588 - I know that now, but...<br />- Was he cool or what?
8012671 8013672 Thank you.
8013756 8016634 Totally fucking cool, in control.
8016717 8019803 Didn't even, you know, really get pissed<br />when you were fucking with him.
8019887 8021055 I was amazed.
8022473 8023682 Want some bacon?
8023766 8025601 No, man. I don't eat pork.
8025684 8026810 Are you Jewish?
8026894 8029230 No, I ain't Jewish.<br />I just don't dig on swine, that's all.
8029313 8030731 Why not?
8030814 8033692 Pigs are filthy animals.<br />I don't eat filthy animals.
8033776 8035861 Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
8035945 8037404 Pork chops taste good.
8037488 8039532 Hey, a sewer rat<br />may taste like pumpkin pie,
8039615 8042576 but I'd never know because I wouldn't eat<br />the filthy motherfuckers.
8043494 8045412 Pigs sleep and root in shit.
8045496 8046997 That's a filthy animal.
8047081 8050161 I ain't eating nothing that ain't got<br />sense enough to disregard its own feces.
8050209 8052878 How about a dog? A dog eats his own feces.
8052962 8054213 I don't eat dog, either.
8055089 8057591 Yeah, but do you consider a dog<br />to be a filthy animal?
8058592 8060678 I wouldn't go so far<br />as to call a dog filthy,
8060761 8062680 but they're definitely dirty.
8062763 8064557 But a dog's got personality.
8064640 8066183 Personality goes a long way.
8066267 8067685 Ah. So by that rationale,
8067768 8069353 if a pig had a better personality,
8069436 8071230 he would cease to be a filthy animal.
8071313 8072314 Is that true?
8072398 8075317 Well, we'd have to be talking about<br />one charming motherfucking pig.
8075401 8077319 I mean, he'd have to be<br />ten times more charming
8077403 8079523 than that Arnold on green acres,<br />know what I'm saying?
8084994 8086954 Oh, man, that's good.
8087037 8089832 That's good, man.<br />You're starting to lighten up.
8090916 8093210 You been sitting there<br />all serious and shit.
8093294 8095129 Man, I've just been sitting here thinking.
8095212 8096380 About what?
8096463 8097756 About the miracle we witnessed.
8098382 8101135 The miracle you witnessed.<br />I witnessed a freak occurrence.
8101218 8102553 What is a miracle, Vincent?
8104805 8105973 An act of god.
8106056 8107600 And what's an act of god?
8111395 8114982 When, um,<br />god makes the impossible possible.
8116025 8120112 But this morning I don't think qualifies.
8120195 8122948 Hey, Vincent, don't you see<br />that shit don't matter?
8123032 8124592 You're judging this shit the wrong way.
8125200 8127161 I mean, it could be<br />god stopped the bullets,
8127244 8130122 or he changed coke to Pepsi,<br />he found my fucking car keys.
8130205 8132583 You don't judge shit like this<br />based on merit.
8132666 8134585 Now, whether or not what we experienced
8134668 8138422 was an "according to hoyle" miracle<br />is insignificant.
8138505 8142760 But what is significant<br />is I felt the touch of god.
8142843 8144178 God got involved.
8144928 8145971 But why?
8146680 8149183 Well, that's what's fucking with me.<br />I don't know why.
8149266 8151185 But I can't go back to sleep.
8151268 8154104 You're serious?<br />You're really thinking about quitting?
8154188 8155773 - The life?<br />- Yeah.
8155856 8156857 Most definitely.
8156940 8158275 Fuck.
8158984 8160277 What you going to do, then?
8161695 8163113 Well...
8163197 8165237 That's what I've been<br />sitting here contemplating.
8166033 8169161 First, I'm going to deliver this case<br />to marsellus.
8169828 8172665 Then, basically,<br />I'm just going to walk the earth.
8172748 8174124 What you mean, "walk the earth"?
8174208 8176293 You know, like caine in kung fu.
8176377 8179213 Walk from place to place,<br />meet people, get in adventures.
8179296 8181548 And how long do you intend<br />to walk the earth?
8181632 8183717 Until god puts me where he wants me to be.
8183801 8184961 And what if he don't do that?
8185010 8187388 If it takes forever,<br />then I'll walk forever.
8188347 8189932 So you decided to be a bum?
8190015 8193644 I'll just be Jules, Vincent.<br />No more, no less.
8193727 8195688 No, Jules. You decided to be a bum.
8195771 8197731 Just like all those pieces of shit<br />out there
8197815 8200609 who beg for change,<br />who sleep in garbage bins,
8200693 8202069 eat what I throw away.
8202152 8203696 They got a name for that, Jules.
8203779 8205239 It's called a bum.
8205322 8208242 And without a job,<br />a residence, or legal tender,
8208325 8210887 that's what you're going to be, man.<br />You're going to be a fucking bum.
8210911 8213831 Look, my friend,<br />this is just where you and I differ.
8213914 8215082 Garcon.
8215749 8216750 Coffee.
8216834 8221422 Jules, look, what happened this morning,<br />man, I agree it was peculiar.
8221505 8224508 - But water into wine. I...<br />- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.
8224591 8227845 - Don't fucking talk to me that way, man.<br />- If my answers frighten you, Vincent,
8227928 8230347 then you should cease<br />asking scary questions.
8233726 8235144 I'm going to take a shit.
8239565 8242401 Let me ask you something.<br />When did you make this decision?
8242484 8244129 When you were sitting there<br />eating that muffin?
8244153 8245362 Well, yeah.
8245446 8247948 I was sitting here eating my muffin<br />and drinking my coffee
8248031 8249867 and replaying the incident in my head
8249950 8253954 when I had what alcoholics refer to<br />as a moment of clarity.
8254705 8255914 Fuck.
8255998 8257458 To be continued.
8269178 8270679 I love you, pumpkin.
8270763 8272514 And I love you, honey bunny.
8273724 8275684 Everybody, be cool! This is a robbery!
8275768 8278520 Any of you fucking pricks move,
8278604 8281940 and I'll execute every one<br />of you motherfuckers!
8282024 8283609 You got that?
8283692 8285194 You just be quiet over there!
8285277 8286987 Get the fuck down!
8287070 8288322 Get the fuck down!
8288405 8290240 You, you're in a blind spot.
8290324 8293118 Take your dames over to that booth<br />over there on the count of ten.
8293202 8294703 Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!
8294787 8297748 One, two, three, four,<br />five, six, seven, eight...
8297831 8300918 Where the fuck are you going?<br />You fucking yuppie! Get down!
8301001 8305589 - Hey, you, throw those bags!<br />- Fucking wanker! Move! Move!
8305672 8308383 What the fuck are you doing? Move!
8308467 8311507 - The restaurant's ours!<br />- Move! Get down on the fucking floor!
8311553 8313388 Grandpa, down!
8313472 8314973 I'm the manager here,
8315057 8317059 and there's no problem. No problem at all.
8317142 8319704 - You're going to give me a problem?<br />- No, sir, I'm not.
8319728 8321998 I thought you said<br />you're going to give me a fucking problem!
8322022 8323732 You're going to give me a fucking problem?
8325317 8329446 - I think we got a hero here, honey bunny!<br />- Well, just execute him!
8330072 8332616 I am not a hero. I'm just a coffee shop...
8332699 8333909 Get the fuck down!
8333992 8335744 The restaurant's ours!
8335828 8337830 Just take whatever you want.
8338914 8340833 - All right, you talk to the customers.<br />- Yeah.
8340916 8342835 - You tell them to be fucking cool...<br />- Yes.
8342918 8344354 - And everything will be over!<br />- Yeah.
8344378 8346004 - You understand me?<br />- Yes.
8348423 8349675 Listen, everybody.
8350342 8353053 Be calm, cooperate,
8353136 8355347 and this will all be over in a minute.
8355430 8357224 Get the fuck down! Well done.
8369570 8371029 All right, now, people,
8371113 8373049 I'm going to come around<br />and collect your wallets.
8373073 8374199 You don't fucking talk.
8374283 8376702 You just throw them in the bag.<br />Are we clear?
8376785 8378537 I said, are we fucking clear?
8379037 8380789 Good. Now wallets out.
8382708 8384376 That's it. Get the fuck down.
8384459 8385669 In the bag.
8385752 8387087 In the fucking bag!
8387170 8388964 I don't have nothing on me, man.
8391508 8393528 What am I waiting for?<br />In the fucking bag.
8393552 8395846 Laura? Laura, tips.
8395929 8397264 - In the bag.<br />- Yeah.
8397848 8398849 Is that a cellular phone?
8398932 8400475 - Yeah.<br />- In the fucking bag.
8402477 8405898 Tidy up, tidy up. That's it.<br />Now get the fuck down on the floor.
8405981 8407482 In the bag.
8407566 8408817 In the bag.
8421121 8422414 In the bag.
8438096 8440474 - What's in the case?<br />- My boss's dirty laundry.
8440557 8443036 - Your boss makes you do his laundry?<br />- When he wants it clean.
8443060 8444061 Sounds like a shitjob.
8444144 8446897 - Funny. I was thinking the same thing.<br />- Open it.
8447731 8448857 Afraid I can't do that.
8450817 8451818 I didn't hear you.
8451902 8453236 Yes, you did.
8454363 8455656 What's going on?
8456698 8458676 Looks like we got a vigilante<br />in our midst.
8458700 8460327 Shoot him in the face.
8460410 8462639 I hate to shatter your ego,<br />but this ain't the first time
8462663 8463997 I've had a gun pointed at me.
8464081 8466517 You don't take your fucking hand off<br />that case, it'll be your last.
8466541 8468728 Stop causing problems!<br />You'll get us all killed!
8468752 8470396 Give 'em what you got<br />and get 'em out of here!
8470420 8473799 Shut the fuck up, fat man!<br />This ain't none of your goddamn business.
8475008 8477177 Be cool, honey bunny. Be cool.
8477260 8479096 It's no problem. I got it under control.
8480889 8482683 Now, I'm going to count to three.
8484393 8485936 If you don't open that case,
8486019 8488230 I'm going to unload in your fucking face.
8492651 8493986 We clear?
8497614 8498615 One...
8502536 8503704 Two...
8505038 8506123 - Three.<br />- Okay, Ringo.
8506206 8507457 You win.
8508542 8509793 It's yours.
8515632 8517050 Open it.
8521221 8522556 What is it?
8523890 8525017 What is it?
8527102 8529521 - Is that what I think it is?<br />- Mm-hmm.
8533108 8534748 It's beautiful.
8534776 8537320 Goddamn it, what is it?
8539489 8542784 You let him go! You let him go!<br />Let go of him!
8542868 8544846 - Tell that bitch to be cool!<br />- I'm gonna kill you!
8544870 8546639 - Say, "bitch, be cool!"<br />- Be cool, honey bunny!
8546663 8548081 - Say, "bitch, be cool!"<br />- Be cool!
8548165 8550584 - Tell that fucking bitch to chill!<br />- Be cool, honey bunny!
8550667 8552961 - Chill that fucking bitch out!<br />- Chill out, honey bunny!
8553045 8554188 - Let go of him!<br />- Chill!
8554212 8555481 Chill out, honey bunny!
8555505 8556945 Tell her it's going to be all right.
8557007 8558568 - It's going to be all right.<br />- Promise her!
8558592 8559872 - I promise!<br />- Tell her to chill!
8559926 8562196 - Just chill out, honey bunny!<br />- All right, now tell me her name.
8562220 8564222 - Yolanda.<br />- All right, now, yolanda!
8564306 8566099 We're not gonna<br />do anything stupid, are we?
8566183 8569061 - Don't you hurt him!<br />- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody.
8569144 8571396 We're all gonna be like<br />three little fonzies here.
8571480 8572481 And what's fonzie like?
8574107 8575817 Come on, yolanda, what's fonzie like?
8575901 8576901 He's cool?
8576943 8578195 - What?<br />- Cool.
8578278 8579821 Correctamundo!
8579905 8583116 And that's what we're gonna be.<br />We're gonna be cool.
8583742 8587454 Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three.
8588538 8590373 And when I count three,
8590457 8592709 I want you to let go of your gun,
8592793 8594711 put your palms flat on the table,
8595295 8597214 and sit your ass down.
8597923 8601593 But when you do it, you do it cool.
8602511 8603678 You ready?
8604721 8606014 One...
8606932 8608183 Two...
8609351 8610393 Three.
8618610 8620487 Okay, now you let him go!
8620570 8622739 Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool.
8622823 8624699 Now, when you yell at me,<br />it makes me nervous.
8624783 8626868 And when I get nervous, I get scared.
8626952 8628912 And when motherfuckers get scared,
8628995 8631498 that's when motherfuckers<br />accidentally get shot.
8632791 8636044 Just know, you hurt him, you die.
8637295 8639840 Well, that seems to be the situation.
8639923 8643593 But I don't want that,<br />and you don't want that,
8643677 8646596 and Ringo here<br />definitely doesn't want that.
8646680 8648473 So let's see what we can do.
8650350 8651393 Now...
8652227 8653812 Here's the situation.
8654980 8658108 Normally both your asses<br />would be dead as fucking fried chicken,
8658191 8659544 but you happened to pull this shit
8659568 8662088 while I'm in a transitional period,<br />and I don't want to kill you.
8662112 8663613 I want to help you.
8663697 8665657 But I can't give you this case,
8666366 8667951 'cause it don't belong to me.
8668577 8671913 Besides, I been through too much shit<br />over this case this morning
8671997 8673915 to just hand it over to your dumb ass.
8675041 8676501 - Vincent!<br />- [Gasps}
8676585 8677627 be cool!
8678253 8681298 Yolanda, it's cool, baby! It's cool!
8681381 8683842 We still just talking!<br />Come on, point the gun at me!
8683925 8686636 Point the gun at me! There you go.
8686720 8690849 Now, Vincent, you just hang back<br />and don't do a goddamn thing.
8690932 8692475 Tell her we're still cool.
8693393 8696271 - We're still cool, honey bunny.<br />- How we doing, baby?
8697439 8699316 I... I gotta go pee.
8700317 8702319 - I want to go home.<br />- Just hang in there, baby.
8702402 8705197 You're doing great. I'm proud of you.<br />And Ringo's proud of you.
8705280 8706698 It's almost over.
8706781 8708200 Tell her you're proud of her.
8708992 8711828 - I'm proud of you, honey bunny.<br />- I love you.
8711912 8713622 I love you, too, honey bunny.
8713705 8717459 Now, I want you to go in that bag
8717542 8719127 and find my wallet.
8721880 8722964 Which one is it?
8723048 8725258 It's the one that says,<br />"bad motherfucker."
8739856 8743235 That's it. That's my bad motherfucker.
8743318 8745570 Open it up. Take out the money.
8751618 8752786 Count it.
8759501 8760794 How much is there?
8764339 8765465 About $1,500.
8765548 8767842 Okay, put it in your pocket. It's yours.
8768802 8771513 Now, with the rest of those wallets<br />and the register,
8771596 8774182 that makes this a pretty<br />successful little score, huh?
8774266 8776476 Jules, you give<br />that fucking nimrod $1,500,
8776559 8779080 - and I'll shoot him on general principle.<br />- No, yolanda, yolanda!
8779104 8781189 He ain't gonna do a goddamn<br />motherfucking thing.
8781273 8783233 Vince, shut the fuck up!
8784067 8786861 - Shut up!<br />- Come on, yolanda, stay with me, baby.
8788280 8790282 Now, I ain't giving it to him, Vincent.
8790949 8792742 I'm buying something for my money.
8794244 8795787 Wanna know what I'm buying, Ringo?
8796413 8798331 - What?<br />- Your life.
8799124 8802002 I'm giving you that money<br />so I don't have to kill your ass.
8803461 8804754 You read the Bible, Ringo?
8806214 8807757 Not regularly, no.
8807841 8810260 Well, there's this passage<br />I got memorized.
8810844 8813096 Ezekiel 25:17.
8814222 8815765 "The path of the righteous man
8815849 8819144 is beset on all sides<br />by the inequities of the selfish
8819227 8820770 and the tyranny of evil men.
8821646 8824524 Blessed is he<br />who in the name of charity and good will
8824607 8826776 Shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness,
8826860 8830572 for he is truly his brother's keeper<br />and the finder of lost children.
8831197 8835535 And I will strike down upon thee<br />with great vengeance and furious anger
8835618 8838413 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy my brothers.
8839372 8841666 And you will know I am the lord
8841750 8844085 when I lay my vengeance upon you."
8846338 8848590 Now, I been saying that shit for years.
8848673 8851634 And if you heard it, that meant your ass.
8853178 8854888 I never gave much thought<br />to what it meant.
8854971 8856765 I just thought it was<br />some cold-blooded shit
8856848 8860393 to say to a motherfucker<br />before I popped a cap in his ass.
8860477 8862854 But I saw some shit this morning<br />made me think twice.
8864147 8865565 See, now I'm thinking
8866358 8869819 maybe it means you're the evil man
8869903 8871988 and I'm the righteous man,
8872072 8873948 and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
8874032 8876201 he's the Shepherd<br />protecting my righteous ass
8876284 8877952 in the valley of darkness.
8878745 8880163 Or it could mean
8880872 8884084 you're the righteous man<br />and I'm the Shepherd,
8884167 8887337 and it's the world<br />that's evil and selfish.
8888296 8889756 Now, I'd like that.
8890507 8892342 But that shit ain't the truth.
8893718 8894969 The truth is...
8896805 8898848 You're the weak...
8899891 8903019 And I am the tyranny of evil men.
8904521 8906439 But I'm trying, Ringo.
8907774 8912195 I'm trying real hard to be the Shepherd.
8948648 8951025 I think we should be leaving now.
8951109 8953027 Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
