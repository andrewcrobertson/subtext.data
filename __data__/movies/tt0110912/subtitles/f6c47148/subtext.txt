28331 29638 Forget it. It's too risky.
30705 32001 I'm through doing that shit.
32502 34575 You always say that.<br />The same thing every time.
34864 37602 "l'm through, never again,<br />too dangerous."
37910 39777 I know that's what I always say.<br />I'm always right too.
40322 43572 - You forget about it in a day or two.<br />- The days of me forgetting are over.
43765 45389 The days of me remembering<br />have just begun.
45911 48189 You know, when you go on like this,<br />what you sound like?
48189 50817 - I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.<br />- You sound like a duck.
50864 54470 - Quack, quack, quack...<br />- Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again.
54972 58336 Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never<br />gonna have to hear me quack about never gonna doin' it.
58613 61641 - After tonight?<br />- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
63324 66333 - Can I get anyone more coffee?<br />- Oh, yes!
68138 70609 - Thank you.<br />- You're welcome.
71914 73868 I mean, the way it is now,
73944 75497 you're takin' the same risk<br />as when you rob a bank.
76518 78440 Takin' more of a risk.<br />Banks are easier.
78784 81329 Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you<br />in any way during a robbery.
81730 85260 They're insured. Why should they give a fuck?<br />I don't even need a gun in a Federal bank.
86356 88983 Heard about this one bloke, he walks<br />into a bank with a portable phone.
89591 92477 He gives the phone to a teller.<br />The bloke on the other end says,
92587 96163 "We got this guy's little girl. If you don't<br />give him all your money, we're gonna kill her."
96566 98590 - Did it work?<br />- Fuckin' right it worked. That's what I'm talkin' about.
98710 104916 Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone.<br />Not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.
105342 107320 Cleans the place out.<br />They don't even lift a fuckin' finger.
107666 108981 Did they hurt the little girl?
109793 111886 I don't know. There probably never<br />was a little girl in the first place.
112243 113567 The point of the story isn't a little girl.
113694 116120 The point of the story is they<br />robbed a bank with a telephone.
116887 119550 - You want to rob banks?<br />- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.
119713 122194 I'm just illustrating if we did, it'd be<br />easier than what we've been doing.
122425 125885 - No more liquor stores?<br />- What've we been talkin' about? Yeah, no more liquor stores.
126663 129577 Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.<br />There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.
129699 131633 Vietnamese, Koreans,<br />don't even speak fuckin' English.
131701 134067 You tell 'em empty out the register,<br />they don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about.
134137 135471 They make it too personal.
135652 139979 - We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him.<br />- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
140058 144189 I don't want to kill anybody either.<br />But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them.
144814 145983 And if it's not the gooks,
145983 149444 it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned<br />the store for 15 fucking generations.
149519 153364 You got Grandpa Irving sitting by the...<br />behind the counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.
153862 155630 Try walkin' into one of those places<br />with nothing but a phone.
155630 157250 See how far that gets you.<br />Fuck it. Forget it.
157458 160052 - We're out of it.<br />- Yeah well, what then, day jobs?
160835 162699 - Not in this life.<br />- What then?
164999 166236 Garçon, coffee!
167290 168223 This place.
171176 172420 Garçon means boy.
177614 179962 This place?<br />A coffee shop?
180350 181359 What's wrong with that?
183066 186330 Nobody ever robs restaurants.<br />Why not?
187657 190247 Bars, liquor stores,
190349 193047 gas stations; you get your head<br />blown off stickin' up one of them.
194131 197112 Restaurants, on the other hand,<br />you catch with their pants down.
197742 201044 They're not expectin' to get robbed.<br />Not as expectin' anyway.
201329 206048 - I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this.<br />- Correct.
206409 208920 Same as banks,<br />these places are insured.
209395 211916 Manager.<br />He don't give a fuck.
211916 214724 They're just trying to get you out<br />before you start pluggin' the diners.
214724 218491 Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way<br />they're takin' a bullet for the register.
218839 222057 Busboys. Some wetback gettin'<br />paid $1.50 an hour...
222125 224393 really give a fuck<br />you're stealin' from the owner?
224728 227443 Customers sittin' there with food in their<br />mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.
227897 231066 One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet,<br />next minute, someone is stickin' a gun in their face.
232388 236809 See, I got the idea the last<br />liquor store we stuck up, remember?
237616 239822 - All the customers kept comin' in.<br />- Yeah.
240543 244229 You got the idea of takin' their wallets.<br />Now, that was a good idea.
244447 246959 - Thank you.<br />- Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.
247161 249804 - Yes, we did.<br />- A lot of people come to restaurants.
250241 253460 - A lot of wallets.<br />- Pretty smart, huh?
254360 256036 Pretty smart.
257594 260135 I'm ready. Let's do it.<br />Right now, right here.
260697 265074 - Come on.<br />- All right. Same as last time, remember?
265268 267829 You're crowd control.<br />I'll handle employees.
273619 276383 - I love you, Pumpkin.<br />- I love you, Honey Bunny.
277589 280080 Everybody be cool!<br />This is a robbery!
280158 283025 Any of you fucking pricks move,
283095 286960 and I'll execute<br />every motherfuckin' last one of you.
398510 400740 - Jungle boogie<br />- Get down with the boogie
400812 402973 - Jungle boogie<br />- Get it on
403048 405243 - Jungle boogie<br />- Get down with the boogie
405317 407547 - Jungle boogie<br />- Get it on
407619 409883 - Jungle boogie<br />- Get up with the boogie
409955 412014 - Jungle boogie<br />- Get up with the get down
412090 414388 - Jungle boogie<br />- Get down and boogie
414459 416753 - Jungle boogie<br />- Shake it around
424286 428382 - Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars.<br />- Okay, what you want to know?
428457 431290 - Hash is legal there, right?<br />- It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.
431360 435990 You just can't walk into a restaurant,<br />roll a joint and start puffin' away.
436064 439397 I mean, they want you to smoke in<br />your home or certain designated places.
439468 442130 - Those are hash bars?<br />- Yeah. It breaks down like this. Okay.
442204 444536 It's legal to buy it.<br />It's legal to own it.
444606 447803 And if you're the proprietor<br />of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
447876 452279 It's illegal to carry it, but-but that<br />doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.
452347 456807 If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,<br />it's illegal for them to search you.
456885 460821 - I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have.<br />- Oh, man! I'm goin'.
460889 462563 That's all there is to it.<br />I'm fuckin' goin'.
462690 464682 I know, baby.<br />You'd dig it the most.
466495 469225 - But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?<br />- What?
469298 473234 It's the little differences. I mean, they got<br />the same shit over there that they got here,
473302 475925 - but it's just there, it's a little different.<br />- Example.
476359 479421 Alright, well you can walk into a movie theater<br />in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
479988 483771 And I don't mean just like no paper cup.<br />I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.
483845 487679 And in Paris, you can buy a beer in<br />McDonald's. You know what they call...
487749 491241 a Quarter-Pounder<br />with Cheese in Paris?
491320 493184 They don't call it<br />a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?
493235 496387 No man, they got the metric system.<br />They wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter-Pounder is.
496458 500360 - What do they call it?<br />- They call it a Royale with Cheese.
500429 501896 - Royale with Cheese.<br />- That's right.
501964 503898 What do they call a Big Mac?
503966 507265 Big Mac's a Big Mac,<br />but they call it Le Big Mac.
507336 510464 Le Big Mac.
510539 514703 - What do they call a Whopper?<br />- I don't know. I didn't go into Burger King.
514776 518212 - You know what they put on French fries in Holland instead of ketchup?<br />- What?
518280 521272 - Mayonnaise.<br />- Goddamn!
521350 525650 - I seen 'em do it, man. They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.<br />- Yuck.
528323 531622 We should have shotguns<br />for this kind of deal.
534596 537360 - How many up there?<br />- Three or four.
537432 541027 - That's countin' our guy?<br />- Not sure.
541103 544504 - So that means that it could be up to five guys up there?<br />- It's possible.
544573 546939 We should have fuckin' shotguns.
547564 549671 - What's her name?<br />- Mia.
549745 553943 - Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?<br />- I don't know.
554016 557611 However people meet people.<br />She used to be a actress.
557686 560177 Oh, really?<br />She do anything I'd have seen?
560255 564692 - I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.<br />- Pilot? What's a pilot?
564760 568287 - Well, you know the shows on TV?<br />- I don't watch TV.
568363 571992 Yeah, but you are aware that there<br />is an invention called television,
572067 575161 - and on this invention they show shows, right?<br />- Yeah.
575237 579640 The way they pick TV shows is they make<br />one show. That show's called a pilot.
579708 582126 Then they show that one show<br />to the people who pick shows...
582126 585372 and on the strength of that one show, they<br />decide if they wanna make more shows.
585495 590242 Some get chosen and become television<br />programs. Some don't, become nothin'.
590318 593515 She starred in one of the ones<br />that became nothing.
593588 596352 You remember Antwan Rockamora?
596425 600259 Half-black, half-Samoan.<br />Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror."
600328 603729 - Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?<br />- I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat.
603799 606632 I mean, he got a weight problem.<br />What's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.
606702 611139 - I think I know who you mean. What about him?<br />- Marsellus fucked him up good.
611206 615438 Word 'round the campfire is it was on<br />account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
623585 627612 - So what he'd do? Fuck her?<br />- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.
627689 631386 - Well, then what then?<br />- He gave her a foot massage.
633628 635892 A foot massage?
635964 638023 - That's it?<br />- Mm-hmm.
638100 640034 Then what'd Marsellus do?
640102 643265 Sent a couple cats over to his place.<br />They took him out on his patio.
643338 647274 Threw his ass over the balcony.<br />Nigger fell four stories.
647342 651403 He had a little garden down at the bottom<br />enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.
651480 653744 Nigger fell through that.
653815 656750 Since then, he kind of<br />developed a speech impediment.
658220 660950 - That's a damn shame.<br />- Hmm.
665660 669460 - But still I have to say, you play with matches, you get burned.<br />- What do you mean?
669531 673695 You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's<br />new bride a foot massage.
673769 675389 You don't think he overreacted?
676098 681173 Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to react<br />the way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.
681243 685407 It was a foot massage. A foot massage is<br />nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.
685480 689007 It's laying your hands in a familiar way<br />on Marsellus's new wife.
689084 693987 I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy<br />out? No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.
694055 696148 Whoa, stop right there.<br />Eatin' the bitch out...
696224 698818 and givin' the bitch a foot massage<br />ain't even the same fucking thing.
698894 702830 - It's not. It's the same ballpark.<br />- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.
702898 705833 Now, look, maybe your method<br />of massage differs from mine.
705901 709667 But you know, touchin' his wife's feet and<br />sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies...
709738 714004 ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the<br />same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.
714022 717943 - Look, foot massages don't mean shit!<br />- Have you ever given a foot massage?
719342 721107 Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.
721183 723845 - I'm the foot fuckin' master.<br />- You given a lot of them?
723919 728151 Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and<br />everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.
728223 730885 Would you give a guy<br />a foot massage?
732294 733308 Fuck you.
735063 737347 - You give 'em a lot?<br />- Fuck you.
738233 741498 - You know, I'm kind of tired. I could use a foot massage myself.<br />- Yo, yo, yo, man.
741570 744767 You best back off.<br />I'm gettin' a little pissed here.
745841 748401 - This is the door.<br />- Yeah, it is.
751179 752891 What time you got?
753882 756009 7:22 in the a.m.
756084 759645 No, it ain't quite time yet.<br />Come on. Let's hang back.
767229 770995 Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man<br />a foot massage don't make it right...
771066 774263 for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a<br />building into a glass motherfuckin' house,
774336 777066 fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;<br />that shit ain't right.
777138 780620 Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better<br />paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.
780646 781419 You know what I'm sayin'?
781443 786403 I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a<br />massage don't mean nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.
786481 791111 Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million<br />foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.
791186 794917 We act like they don't, but they do.<br />That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.
794990 797083 There's a sensuous thing goin' on...
797158 800389 where you don't talk about it,<br />but you know it and she knows it.
800462 805525 Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan<br />should've fuckin' better known better.
805600 810003 That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a<br />man with a sense of humor about this shit.
810071 812869 You know what I'm sayin'?
812941 814875 It's an interestin' point.
814943 816877 Come on.<br />Let's get into character.
823241 825820 - What's her name again?<br />- Mia.
825887 828913 - Mia.<br />- Why you so interested in big man's wife?
828990 834223 He's goin' out of town, Florida. And he asked<br />me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.
834296 838255 - Take care of her?<br />- No, man. Just take her out, you know.
838333 841700 Show her a good time.<br />Make sure she don't get lonely.
841770 844295 You're gonna be takin'<br />Mia Wallace out on a date?
844372 845690 It is not a date.
846066 850820 You know, it's just like if you were gonna take<br />your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.
851246 854773 It's just good company, that's all.
858787 863551 It's not a date. It's<br />definitely not a date.
869891 873759 Hey, kids.<br />How you boys doin'?
873828 876490 Hey, keep chillin'.
883654 885468 You know who we are?
885540 889499 We're associates of your<br />business partner, Marsellus Wallace.
889577 892603 You do remember<br />your business partner, don't you?
895316 898251 Now, let me take<br />a wild guess here.
900288 903314 - You're Brett, right?<br />- Yeah.
903391 907725 I thought so. You remember<br />your business partner Marsellus Wallace,
907795 909626 don't ya, Brett?
909697 911358 Yeah, I remember.
911432 915766 Good. Looks like me and Vincent<br />caught you boys at breakfast.
915837 918465 Sorry about that.<br />Whatcha havin'?
918539 920507 Hamburgers.
920575 924671 Hamburgers! The cornerstone<br />of any nutritious breakfast.
926047 928345 What kind of hamburgers?
928416 930145 - Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.<br />- No, no, no.
930218 933312 Where'd you get 'em?<br />McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box?
933388 936186 - Where?<br />- Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.
936257 939385 Big Kahuna Burger!<br />That's that Hawaiian burger joint.
939460 943396 I hear they got some tasty burgers. I<br />ain't never had one myself. How are they?
943464 946160 They're... They're good.
946234 948862 You mind if I try one of yours?
948936 951370 - This is yours here, right?<br />- Yeah.
961549 964677 This is a tasty burger!<br />Vincent!
964752 967277 You ever had<br />a Big Kahuna burger?
968289 970814 Want a bite?<br />They're real tasty.
970892 974328 - I ain't hungry.<br />- Well, if you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime.
974395 978229 Me, I can't usually get 'em<br />'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,
978299 981427 which pretty much makes me<br />a vegetarian.
981502 984665 But I do love the taste<br />of a good burger. Mmmm.
985402 989267 You know what they call a<br />Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in France?
989344 991403 - No.<br />- Tell 'em, Vincent.
991479 995506 - A Royale with Cheese.<br />- A Royale with Cheese.
995583 999041 You know why they call it that?
999120 1002180 Uh, because of<br />the metric system?
1003257 1006556 Check out the big brain<br />on Brett!
1006627 1009960 You're a smart motherfucker.<br />That's right. The metric system.
1012300 1014427 - What's in this?<br />- Sprite.
1014502 1016436 Sprite. Good.
1016504 1020372 You mind if I have some of your<br />tasty beverage to wash this down with?
1020441 1021963 Go right ahead.
1034756 1037589 That hit the spot.
1037658 1041719 You. Flock of Seagulls.<br />You know why we're here?
1041796 1045323 - Why don't you tell my man Vince here where you got the shit hid.<br />- It's over...
1045400 1048995 I don't remember askin' you<br />a goddamned thing!
1052707 1054504 You were sayin'?
1054575 1056634 It's in the cupboard.

1097718 1100915 I got yours. Vincent. Right?<br />B-But I never got yours.
1100988 1106324 - My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.<br />- No, no, no.
1107795 1110730 I just want you to know how...
1113367 1116859 I just want you to know how sorry we are<br />th-that things got so fucked up...
1116938 1119133 with us and Mr. Wallace.
1119207 1122349 W-We got into this thing with<br />the best intentions. Really. I never...
1123778 1127179 Oh, I'm sorry,<br />did I break your concentration?
1127248 1129842 I didn't mean to do that. Please.
1129917 1135082 Continue. You were saying something<br />about "best intentions."
1136491 1140393 What's the matter?<br />Oh, you were finished!
1140461 1143191 Oh, well, allow me to retort.
1146734 1149726 What does Marsellus Wallace<br />look like?
1149804 1151999 What?
1153045 1155338 - What country you from?<br />- What?
1155409 1159675 - "What" ain't no country I ever heard of. They speak English in What?<br />- W-What?
1159747 1162443 - English, motherfucker! Do you speak it?<br />- Yes!
1162517 1164212 - Then you know what I'm sayin'!<br />- Yes.
1164285 1167721 Describe what Marsellus Wallace<br />looks like!
1167788 1170416 - What? l...<br />- Say "what" again!
1170491 1174427 Say "what" again! I dare ya!<br />I double dare you, motherfucker!
1174495 1178397 - Say "what" one more goddamn time!<br />- H-H-He's black.
1178466 1180798 - Go on!<br />- He's bald!
1180868 1183598 - Does he look like a bitch?<br />- What?
1185339 1189366 Does he look... like a bitch?
1189443 1192343 - No!<br />- Then why you tryin' to fuck him like a bitch, Brett?
1192384 1196212 - I didn't.<br />- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!
1196450 1198025 - You tried to fuck him.<br />- No, no.
1198201 1202962 But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be<br />fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
1204025 1207085 - You read the Bible, Brett?<br />- Yes!
1207161 1211723 Well, there's this passage I got memorized.<br />Sort of fits this occasion.
1211799 1214131 Ezekiel 25:17.
1215366 1217500 "The path of the righteous man..."
1217572 1221508 is beset on all sides<br />by the inequities of the selfish...
1221576 1224511 and the tyranny of evil men.
1224579 1229516 Blessed is he who,<br />in the name of charity and goodwill,
1229584 1232747 shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness,
1232820 1235482 for he is truly<br />his brother's keeper...
1235556 1239117 and the finder of lost children.
1239193 1242993 And I will strike down upon thee<br />with great vengeance...
1243064 1245032 and furious anger...
1245099 1249763 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy My brothers!
1249837 1253671 And you will know<br />My name is the Lord...
1253741 1257142 "when I lay My vengeance<br />upon thee!"
1275363 1278025 I think you gonna find...
1278099 1280761 when all this shit<br />is over and done...
1282436 1286805 I think you're gonna find yourself<br />one smilin' motherfucker.
1288376 1291174 The thing is, Butch,
1291245 1294271 right now...<br />you got ability.
1295950 1298384 But painful as it may be,
1298452 1301615 ability... don't last.
1303591 1305902 And your days are just about over.
1307762 1312165 Now, that's a hard<br />motherfuckin' fact of life.
1312233 1317261 But that's a fact of life your ass<br />is gonna have to get realistic about.
1319173 1324634 You see, this business is filled to<br />the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.
1324712 1328671 Motherfuckers who thought<br />their ass would age like wine.
1330384 1334115 If you mean it turns<br />to vinegar... it does.
1335356 1339622 If you mean it gets better<br />with age... it don't.
1341295 1343263 Besides, Butch,
1344999 1348628 how many fights you think<br />you got in you anyway?
1348703 1350898 Hmm?
1350971 1352939 Two?
1354041 1357442 Boxers don't have<br />an old-timers' day.
1358546 1362539 You came close,<br />but you never made it.
1362616 1366814 And if you were gonna make it,<br />you would have made it before now.
1383537 1385801 You my nigger?
1390478 1392878 Certainly appears so.
1399320 1403256 The night of the fight,<br />you may feel a slight sting.
1406393 1409760 That's pride fuckin' with you.
1410831 1413425 Fuck pride!
1415169 1418195 Pride only hurts.
1418272 1420206 It never helps.
1421642 1423667 You fight through that shit.
1425179 1430082 'Cause a year from now,<br />when you kickin' it in the Caribbean,
1430151 1435095 you gonna say to yourself,<br />"Marsellus Wallace was right."
1437064 1441330 I got no problem<br />with that, Mr. Wallace.
1441401 1445201 In the fifth,<br />your ass goes down.
1449276 1451210 Say it.
1453480 1456916 In the fifth, my ass goes down.
1458852 1461377 Yo, Vincent Vega.<br />Our man in Amsterdam.
1461455 1465915 Jules Winfield, our man in Inglewood.<br />Get your asses on in here.
1465993 1469827 - Goddamn, nigger, what's up with them clothes?<br />- You don't even want to know.
1471897 1473162 Where's the big man?
1473233 1476168 The big man's right over there<br />takin' care of some business.
1476236 1480696 Why don't you hang back a second or two.<br />You see the white boy leave, go on over.
1483410 1485674 How ya been?
1485746 1489682 - I been doin' pretty good. How 'bout yourself?<br />- All right.
1492285 1494152 So I hear you're<br />takin' Mia out tomorrow.
1497291 1499486 At Marsellus's request.
1500761 1503321 - Have you met Mia?<br />- Not yet.
1504497 1506594 What's so fuckin' funny?
1506667 1509261 - Not a goddamn thing.<br />- I got to piss.
1509336 1513602 Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot,<br />all right? It's the big man's wife.
1513674 1516336 I'm gonna sit across from her,<br />chew my food with my mouth closed,
1516410 1518378 Iaugh at her fuckin' jokes,<br />and that's it.
1518445 1521573 Hey, my name's Paul,<br />and this shit's between y'all.
1521648 1524708 Then what'd you fuckin'<br />ask me about it for?
1524785 1527276 Asshole.
1533527 1535722 - Gimme a pack of Red Apples.<br />- Filters?
1535796 1537730 No.
1540567 1544469 - You lookin' at somethin', friend?<br />- You ain't my friend, palooka.
1546573 1550065 - What's that?<br />- I think you heard me just fine, punchy.
1550143 1552737 Vincent Vega's in the house?
1552813 1556112 My nigger,<br />get your ass over here.
1563690 1566488 - What's up?<br />- Man, I'm really sorry.
1566560 1568721 You shouldn't worry about it.
1568795 1571764 Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.
1574268 1576600 And some matches.
1579706 1581640 Thanks.
1583510 1587844 It's as if it turns every part<br />of your body into the tip of a penis.
1587915 1590817 - Whoa.<br />- I'll lend it to you. It's a great book on piercing.
1590825 1596288 Well, you see how they use that gun to pierce your ears,<br />they don't use that to pierce your nipples, do they?
1596356 1600224 Forget that gun. That guns goes against<br />the entire idea behind piercing.
1600294 1605163 All my piercing, 18 places on my body,<br />every one of 'em done with a needle.
1605232 1608724 Five in each ear, one through<br />the nipple of my left breast,
1608802 1611930 two in my right nostril,<br />one in my left eyebrow,
1612005 1614872 one in my belly,<br />one in my lip, one in my clit,
1614942 1618400 - and I wear a stud in my tongue.<br />- Excuse me.
1618478 1620412 I was just curious,
1620480 1624348 but, um... why would you wear<br />a stud in your tongue?
1624418 1627910 Sex thing.<br />Helps fellatio.
1627988 1631947 Vincenzo.<br />Step in my office.
1638732 1641792 This is Panda from Mexico.<br />Very good stuff.
1641868 1645304 Now, that's Bava.<br />Different, but equally good.
1645372 1648307 And that is Choco<br />from the Harz Mountains of Germany.
1648375 1652812 Now, the first two are the same.<br />300 a gram. Those are friend prices.
1652879 1655848 But this one<br />is a little more expensive.
1655916 1658316 This is 500 a gram.
1658385 1661786 But, when you shoot it, you will know<br />where that extra money went.
1661855 1665951 There's nothing wrong with these two.<br />This is real, real, real good shit.
1666026 1669689 But this one<br />is a fuckin' madman.
1669763 1672527 Remember, I just got back<br />from Amsterdam.
1672599 1675625 Am I a nigger?<br />Are we in Inglewood? No.
1675702 1678865 You're in my home. Now, white people<br />who know the difference...
1678939 1681931 between good shit and bad shit,<br />this is the house they come to.
1682009 1685376 Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi<br />Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...
1685445 1688744 - any old day of the fuckin' week.<br />- That's a bold statement.
1688815 1692683 This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.<br />This is a seller's market.
1692753 1696746 Coke is fuckin' dead<br />as... dead.
1696823 1700691 Heroin, it's comin' back<br />in a big fuckin' way.
1701962 1705420 - All right. Gimme three grams of madman.<br />- Okay.
1705499 1708935 Now, if it's as good as you say it is,<br />I'll come back and buy another thousand.
1709002 1711766 I just hope that I still<br />have some left for ya,
1711838 1716036 but I'm givin' you some<br />out of my own private stash.
1716109 1719272 That is what a nice guy I am.
1719346 1723442 - And I'm outta balloons. Is a baggie all right?<br />- Yeah, that's cool.
1723517 1725508 All right.<br />I'll just get one for ya.
1725585 1730522 Honey, will you get me some baggies<br />and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?
1730590 1732558 Okay.
1732626 1736153 Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi?<br />She ain't got a boyfriend.
1736229 1739528 - You wanna hang out and get high?<br />- Which one's Trudi?
1739599 1743763 - The one with all the shit in her face?<br />- No, that's Jody.
1743837 1746271 That's my wife.
1746339 1750935 - I'm sorry, man.<br />- Thank you.
1751011 1754879 - No, I can't. I gotta be someplace.<br />- All right, no problemo.
1754948 1757678 I'll take a rain check.
1757751 1761084 - Oh.<br />- Thank you, Jody.
1761154 1764453 Still got your Malibu?
1764524 1767618 Oh, man, you know what some fucker<br />did the other day?
1767694 1769628 - What?<br />- Fuckin' keyed it.
1769696 1773291 - Oh, man, that's fucked up.<br />- Tell me about it.
1773366 1776062 I had it in storage<br />for three years.
1776136 1780470 It was out five days, and some<br />dickless piece of shit fucked with it.
1780540 1784977 They should be fuckin' killed, man.<br />No trial, no jury, straight to execution.
1785045 1789778 Oh I wish I could've caught him doin' it.<br />I'd have given anything to catch that asshole doin' it.
1789850 1794583 - It'd been worth him doin' it just so I could've caught him.<br />- What a fucker!
1794654 1797452 What's more chicken-shit<br />than fuckin' with a man's automobile?
1797524 1800425 - I mean don't fuck with another man's vehicle.<br />- You don't do it.
1800494 1802894 - It's just against the rules.<br />- Thank you.
1802963 1805124 Thank you.
1805198 1807996 - Mind if I shoot up here?<br />- Hey, mi casa es su casa.
1808068 1811367 Muchas gracias.

2232357 2236691 Durward Kirby burger, bloody.
2236761 2240663 And... a five-dollar shake.
2240732 2243462 How do you want that shake,<br />Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?
2243534 2247664 - Martin and Lewis.<br />- Did you just order a five-dollar shake?
2247739 2249798 Mm-hmm.
2249874 2253037 That's a shake?<br />That's milk and ice cream?
2253111 2257514 - Last I heard.<br />- That's five dollars? You don't put bourbon in it or nothin'?
2257582 2259948 - No.<br />- Just checking.
2260017 2262713 I'll be right back<br />with your drinks.
2262787 2264721 To Lonesome Town
2264789 2268748 To cry my troubles away
2270361 2274422 Could you, um...<br />roll me one of those, cowboy?
2274499 2277366 You can have this one, cowgirl.
2277435 2279369 Thanks.
2279437 2281837 The streets are filled<br />with regret
2284108 2286133 Think nothin' of it.
2286210 2290044 Lay me down in Lonesome Town
2290114 2293641 - I can learn to forget<br />- So...
2293718 2296812 Marsellus said<br />you just got back from Amsterdam.
2296888 2300016 - Sure did.<br />- How long were you there?
2300091 2302616 Just over three years.
2305163 2307996 I go there about once a year<br />to chill out for a month.
2308065 2311796 No kiddin'?<br />I didn't know that.
2311869 2314804 Why would you?
2319477 2321411 I heard you did a pilot.
2322680 2326377 - That was my 15 minutes.<br />- What was it?
2326451 2331150 It was a show about a team of female<br />secret agents called Fox Force Five.
2331222 2333952 - What?<br />- Fox Force Five.
2334025 2336289 Fox, as in were a bunch<br />of foxy chicks.
2336360 2338828 Force, as in we're a force<br />to be reckoned with.
2338896 2341660 And five, as in there's<br />one-two-three-four-five of us.
2341732 2345429 There was a blond one,<br />Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.
2345503 2348631 The Japanese fox<br />was a kung fu master.
2348706 2352767 The black girl<br />was a demolition expert.
2352844 2355711 French fox's speciality was sex.
2355780 2360149 - What was your speciality?<br />- Knives.
2360283 2362251 The character I played,<br />Raven McCoy,
2362318 2366186 her background was she grew up<br />raised by circus performers.
2366255 2370521 According to the show, she was the<br />deadliest woman in the world with a knife.
2370593 2373357 And she knew<br />a zillion old jokes.
2373429 2377559 Her grandfather,<br />an old vaudevillian, taught her.
2377633 2380932 And if we would have got picked up,<br />they would've worked in a gimmick...
2381003 2384871 where every show<br />I would've told another joke.
2386075 2388839 You know any of them old jokes?
2388911 2392642 Well, I only got the chance to say one<br />'cause we only did one show.
2392715 2395275 - Tell me.<br />- It's corny.
2396185 2398278 Don't be that way.<br />Tell me.
2398354 2402051 - No, you wouldn't like it, and I'd be embarrassed.<br />- You'd be embarr...
2402124 2406060 You told 50 million people,<br />and you can't tell me?
2406128 2409996 - I promise I won't laugh.<br />- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.
2410066 2412398 That's not what I meant.<br />You know it.
2412468 2415904 Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you<br />'cause it's been built up too much.
2415972 2418566 What a gyp.
2419742 2422108 Martin and Lewis.
2425181 2427581 Vanilla Coke.
2431921 2435254 Mmm. Yummy.
2435324 2438293 You think I could<br />have a sip of that?
2439829 2441990 Be my guest.
2442064 2446091 I gotta know what<br />a five-dollar shake tastes like.
2446168 2449626 - You can use my straw. I don't have cooties.<br />- Yeah, but maybe I do.
2449705 2452572 Cooties I can handle.
2452642 2454610 All right.
2461684 2464482 Goddamn, that's a pretty<br />fuckin' good milkshake!
2464553 2468614 - Told ya.<br />- I don't know if it was worth $5, but it's pretty fuckin' good.
2503559 2507086 - Don't you hate that?<br />- Hate what?
2507163 2509495 Uncomfortable silences.
2511500 2516028 Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about<br />bullshit in order to be comfortable?
2516105 2520041 I don't know.<br />That's a good question.
2520109 2524842 That's when you know<br />you found somebody really special.
2524914 2529613 When you can just shut the fuck up for<br />a minute and comfortably share silence.
2529685 2533781 Well, I don't think we're quite there yet,<br />but don't feel bad. We just met each other.
2535291 2538419 I'll tell you what.
2538494 2541759 I'm gonna go to the bathroom<br />and powder my nose.
2541831 2545028 You sit here...<br />and think of something to say.
2546268 2548202 I'll do that.
2551839 2552473 Okay.
2577733 2579928 I said goddamn!
2580002 2583165 Goddamn!<br />Goddamn.
2585775 2588369 I need some hair spray.
2594216 2596207 Mmmm.
2596285 2600619 Don't you just love it when you come back from<br />the bathroom to find your food waiting for you?
2600689 2603089 We're lucky<br />we got anything at all.
2603159 2606287 I don't think Buddy Holly's<br />much of a waiter.
2606362 2609490 Maybe we should've sat<br />in Marilyn Monroe's section.
2609565 2612625 - Which one? There's two Monroes.<br />- No, there's not.
2612701 2615033 That is Marilyn Monroe.
2615104 2617834 That is Mamie Van Doren.
2618997 2622844 I don't see Jayne Mansfield,<br />so she must have the night off or somethin'.
2622912 2626348 - Pretty smart.<br />- Yeah. I got my moments.
2626415 2630784 - So did you think of somethin' to say?<br />- Actually, I did.
2632421 2634389 However...
2636092 2639118 you seem like<br />a really nice person, and l...
2639195 2642028 - I don't want to offend you.<br />- Oooh.
2642098 2647297 This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless,<br />boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.
2647369 2650361 This sounds like you<br />actually have somethin' to say.
2650439 2653272 Well, well, I do. I do.
2653342 2657403 - But you have to promise not to be offended.<br />- No, no.
2657480 2661712 You can't promise somethin' like that.<br />I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.
2661784 2666653 So you can go ahead and ask me what you're gonna ask me,<br />and my natural response could be to get offended.
2666722 2669088 Then, through no fault of my own,<br />I would have broken my promise.
2669158 2671854 - Let's just forget it.<br />- That's an impossibility.
2671927 2675988 Trying to forget anything as intriguing<br />as this would be an exercise in futility.
2676065 2678260 - Is that a fact?<br />- And besides,
2678334 2683362 - isn't it more, uh, exciting when you don't have permission?<br />- All right, all right.
2683439 2686237 Well, here goes.
2686308 2689334 What did you think about<br />what happened to Antwan?
2689411 2692847 - Who's Antwan?<br />- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.
2692915 2696146 - He fell out of a window.<br />- Hmm. Hmm.
2696218 2700917 Well, that is one way to say it.<br />Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out.
2700990 2704153 Another way would be<br />he was thrown out by Marsellus.
2704226 2709357 Yet even another way is to say he was thrown<br />out of a window by Marsellus because of you.
2709431 2711865 - Is that a fact?<br />- No.
2711934 2715062 No, it's not a fact. It's just what I heard.<br />That's just what I heard.
2715137 2718038 - Who told you?<br />- They.
2718107 2720575 "They" talk a lot, don't they?
2722745 2725407 They certainly do.<br />They certainly do.
2725481 2729884 - Don't be shy, Vincent. What else did "they" say?<br />- I'm... I'm not shy.
2729952 2732477 - Um...<br />- Did it involve the "F" word?
2732555 2736548 No, no, no, no, no. They just said that<br />Antwan had given you a foot massage.
2738093 2740721 - And?<br />- And... And nothin'.
2740796 2741863 That's it.
2743732 2745791 You heard Marsellus...
2745868 2750237 threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourth-story<br />window for giving me a foot massage?
2750306 2752240 - Mm-hmm.<br />- And you believe that?
2752308 2756836 I could... Well, I mean<br />at the time I was told it sounded reasonable.
2756912 2760006 Marsellus throwing Tony out<br />of a fourth-story window...
2760082 2762842 for massaging my feet<br />seemed reasonable?
2762919 2766077 No, it seemed excessive,<br />but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.
2766155 2769417 I mean I understand that Marsellus<br />is very protective of you.
2769491 2774121 A husband being protective<br />of his wife is one thing.
2774196 2777927 A husband almost killing another man for<br />touching his wife's feet is something else.
2778000 2780194 But did it happen?
2780269 2786505 Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was<br />my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.
2786575 2788175 Really?
2788344 2791777 Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus<br />threw Tony out that fourth-story window...
2791848 2794382 except Marsellus and Tony.
2794450 2798443 When you little scamps get together,<br />you're worse than a sewing circle.
2798587 2802455 Ladies and gentlemen.<br />Now the moment you've all been waiting for.
2802524 2807552 The world-famous<br />Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.
2809965 2814299 Now, this is where<br />one lucky couple...
2814370 2818830 will win this handsome trophy<br />that Marilyn here is holding.
2818907 2822468 Now, who will be<br />our first contestants?
2822544 2824808 - Right here!<br />- All right!
2824880 2827906 - I wanna dance.<br />- No, no, no, no, no.
2827983 2832716 No, no, no, no, no. I do believe<br />Marsellus, my husband, your boss,
2832788 2836224 told you to take me out<br />and do whatever I wanted.
2836292 2839989 Now I wanna dance;<br />I wanna win; I want that trophy.
2840062 2841270 - So dance good.<br />- All right. You asked for it.
2841271 2842002 - So dance good.<br />- All right. You asked for it.
2842073 2845642 Let's hear it<br />for our first contestants.
2850247 2855514 Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening.<br />Young lady, what is your name?
2855585 2857576 Mrs. Mia Wallace.
2857654 2860282 And how 'bout your fella here?
2860357 2862188 Vincent Vega.
2862259 2865695 All right, let's see what you can do.<br />Take it away!
2865762 2868697 - Go for it.<br />- Come on!
2886984 2890943 It was a teenage wedding<br />and the old folks wished them well
2892956 2896915 You could see that Pierre<br />did truly love the mademoiselle
2898996 2903092 And now the young monsieur<br />and madame have rung the chapel bell
2905068 2909368 C'est la vie say the old folks<br />It goes to show you never can tell
2911241 2915405 They furnished off an apartment<br />with a two-room Roebucks sale
2917314 2921580 The 'coolerador was crammed<br />with TV dinners and ginger ale
2923453 2927355 But when Pierre found work the<br />little money comin' worked out well
2929459 2933725 C'est la vie say the old folks<br />It goes to show you never can tell
2935432 2939801 They had a hi-fi phono<br />and boy did they let it blast
2941838 2946104 Seven hundred little records<br />all rock, rhythm and jazz
2947844 2951940 But when the sun went down<br />the rapid tempo of the music fell
2953884 2958912 C'est la vie say the old folks<br />It goes to show you never can tell
2984414 2988646 They had a teenage wedding<br />and the old folks wished them well
2990687 2994646 You could see that Pierre<br />did truly love the mademoiselle
3029860 3033057 Is that what you call<br />an uncomfortable silence?
3033130 3036497 I don't know what you call that.
3036566 3039194 Drinks! Music!
3040203 3042433 I'm gonna take a piss.
3042506 3047466 That's a little bit more information<br />than I needed, Vince but go right ahead.
3060557 3062457 Girl

3099863 3102957 One drink, and that's it.
3103033 3106867 Don't be rude.<br />Drink your drink, but do it quickly.

3129193 3132125 But what they're sayin', girl<br />it cuts like a knife
3132195 3134561 The boy's no good
3134631 3137327 Well, I've finally have found<br />what I been lookin' for
3137400 3141803 But if they get a chance they'll end it for sure<br />Sure they would
3141871 3144567 Baby, I've done all I could
3145241 3149305 You see, this is<br />a moral test of oneself.
3149379 3152644 Whether or not<br />you can maintain loyalty.
3152716 3156015 Because... being loyal<br />is very important.
3156086 3160682 You never get tired of putting me down<br />and I never know when I come around

3309188 3311122 Answer.
3311190 3313624 Have you got the ring?
3313692 3317526 - Why, certainly.<br />- Join hands, you two lovebirds.
3317596 3320030 Please! Please!
3320098 3322760 Yes, yes.<br />Hold hands, you lovebirds.
3329007 3331168 Fuck you, Lance!<br />Answer!
3336248 3338182 Now what do you say?
3338250 3341185 I give up!<br />I'll marry you!
3341253 3345917 Lance!<br />The goddamn phone's ringing!
3347626 3349560 I can hear it.
3349628 3353064 I thought you told those fuckin'<br />assholes never to call here this late!
3353131 3354465 Yeah, I told them.
3354533 3358398 And that is exactly what I'm going<br />to tell this fucking asshole right now.
3359972 3362805 - Don't you dare strike me!<br />- Hello.
3362875 3365139 Lance! Vincent.
3365210 3368145 I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.<br />I'm coming to your house.
3368213 3372309 W-Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man.<br />W-What's the problem?
3372384 3375649 - I got this chick, she's fuckin' O.D.in' on me!<br />- Well, don't bring her here!
3375721 3380055 I'm not even fuckin' joking with you, man!<br />Do not be bringing some fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!
3380125 3382184 - No choice.<br />- Wh... She's O.D.in'?
3382261 3385458 - She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!<br />- Just dandy.
3385530 3389728 Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet,<br />and you take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.
3389801 3392235 - Negative!<br />- This is not my fuckin' problem, man!
3392304 3396035 You fucked her up,<br />you fuckin' deal with this!
3396108 3398941 Uh, are you talkin' to me<br />on a cellular phone?
3399011 3401445 I don't know you.<br />Who is this? Don't come here!
3401513 3404846 I'm hanging up the phone!<br />Prank caller! Prank caller!
3414525 3415860 The hell was that?
3417829 3420263 Have you lost your fucking mind?
3420332 3423267 - You were talking about drug shit on a cellular phone!<br />- Lance, help me.
3423335 3426270 - You crashed your car into my fucking house!<br />- Grab her feet.
3426338 3429774 Are you deaf? You are not bringing<br />this fucked-up bitch into my house!
3429841 3432276 This "fucked-up bitch"<br />is Marsellus Wallace's wife.
3432314 3434478 - Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is? Do you?<br />- Yeah.
3434547 3437002 If she croaks on me,<br />I am a fucking grease spot!
3437010 3442946 Now look, I will be forced to tell him that you did<br />not help and that... and you let her die on your fucking lawn.
3443021 3445956 Now, come on. Help me, help me.<br />Pick her up.
3447025 3448959 Shit.
3451029 3453395 Lance!
3453465 3455399 Shit.
3455467 3457901 It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.
3457970 3461303 What the fuck's going on out here?
3461373 3463307 Who's she?
3463375 3466310 Go to the fridge and get the thing<br />with the adrenalin shot.
3466378 3468437 - What's wrong with her?<br />- She's O.D.ing!
3468513 3470572 - Get her the hell outta here!<br />- Get the shot!
3470649 3474176 - Fuck you! Fuck you too!<br />- What a fuckin' bitch.
3474252 3476186 You just keep talking to her,<br />all right?
3476254 3478689 She's gettin' the shot.<br />I'm going to go get my little black medical book.
3478757 3480548 The fuck you need<br />a medical book for?
3480626 3483181 - I've never had to give an adrenalin shot before!<br />- You've never given an adrenaline shot?
3483405 3484243 I never had to, alright!
3484448 3486793 I don't go joy-poppin' with a bunch of bubble-gummers!<br />My friends can handle their highs!
3486832 3488566 - Get the shot!<br />- I am, if you'll let me!
3488634 3491769 - I ain't stopping you!<br />- Stop talking to me. Start talking to her!
3491837 3494271 - Get the shot!<br />- All right!
3497442 3500878 - Hurry up, Lance. We're losing her!<br />- I'm looking as fast as I can!
3500946 3502880 What's he looking for?
3502948 3505883 - I don't know. Some book.<br />- What are you looking for?
3505951 3508886 - A little black medical book.<br />- What are you looking for?
3508954 3513050 My little black fucking medical book!<br />It's like a textbook they give to nurses.
3513125 3516060 - I never saw no medical book.<br />- Trust me. I have one.
3516128 3519063 - If it's so important, why don't you keep it with the shot?<br />- I don't know!
3519131 3523067 - Stop bothering me!<br />- Listen, while you're looking, that girl's gonna die on our carpet.
3523135 3525069 You're never gonna find<br />anything in this mess!
3525137 3529039 - I'm gonna fucking kill you if you don't shut up!<br />- Lance, get in here!
3529107 3533339 - Right? Pig.<br />- Get the fuck outta my way.
3533412 3536848 - Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot. Come on.<br />- Okay. Look, while I'm doing this,
3536915 3539139 you take off her shirt<br />and find her heart.
3539954 3541996 - Does it gotta be exact?<br />- Yeah, it's gotta be exact.
3542060 3544131 We're giving her a shot in the heart,<br />so I guess it's gotta be fuckin' exact.
3544155 3546890 I don't know exactly where her heart is.<br />I'm gonna think it's right here.
3546958 3550621 - That's it.<br />- This it? All right, what I need is a big, fat magic marker.
3550695 3552629 - You got it?<br />- What?
3552697 3555393 A magic marker.<br />A felt pen!
3555467 3558095 A fuckin' black magic marker!<br />Christ.
3558170 3563233 - Come on, man. Hurry up!<br />- Fuck! Okay, okay. Okay. I think it's ready.
3566411 3568902 - Hurry up, man.<br />- Here, I'll tell you what to do.
3568980 3571915 - No, no, no, man, I ain't gi... You're gonna give her the shot.<br />- No, you're gonna give her the shot.
3571983 3575218 - I ain't giving her the shot. I never done this before.<br />- I ain't giving her the shot. Yeah, I never done this before either, alright!
3575286 3577978 I ain't starting now! Look, you brought her here,<br />and that means you give her the shot.
3578056 3581457 The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch to your house,<br />then I give her the shot. Give her the shot.
3581526 3583460 - Give it to me. Give me that.<br />- Here.
3584428 3586463 All right, tell me what to do.
3586531 3590223 Okay, you're giving her an injection<br />of adrenalin straight to her heart.
3590261 3592836 But she's got a breastplate...<br />You gotta pierce through that.
3592884 3595899 So what you gotta do is...<br />You gotta bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.
3595907 3599443 - I gotta... I gotta stab her three times?<br />- No, you don't gotta fucking stab her three times! You just gotta stab her once!
3599511 3602547 But it's gotta be hard enough to get<br />through her breastplate into her heart.
3602614 3605549 Once you do that,<br />you p-press down on the p-plunger.
3605617 3608608 - Okay. Then what happens?<br />- Kinda curious about that myself.
3608686 3611121 This ain't no fuckin' joke!<br />Am I gonna kill her?
3611189 3614625 - She's supposed to come out of it like that. It's...<br />- All right, count to three.
3614693 3616888 - All right. Ready?<br />- One.
3622167 3623691 Two.
3632676 3633644 Three!
3648226 3651491 If you're all right,<br />then say something.
3652463 3654589 Something.
3654666 3656990 That was fuckin' trippy.
3659171 3662504 - Ohh.<br />- Oh, man.
3687199 3689133 Mia. Mia.
3691303 3693737 What's...
3693805 3696603 What's your thoughts on... on...
3696675 3698700 On how to handle this?
3698777 3700711 What's yours?
3703782 3708284 Well, I'm of the opinion<br />that if Marsellus lived his whole life,
3708352 3711750 he doesn't need to know<br />nothing about this incident.
3711884 3714682 If Marsellus knew<br />about this incident,
3714753 3716812 I'd be in as much trouble as you.
3716889 3719380 I seriously doubt that.
3719458 3722393 I can keep a secret if you can.
3724430 3726364 Shake on it?
3731570 3733868 Mum's the word?
3733939 3735873 Cool.
3735941 3740275 Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going<br />to go home and have a heart attack.
3743015 3744949 Vincent.
3746819 3749845 Do you wanna hear<br />my Fox Force Five joke?
3750923 3752857 Sure.
3752925 3755951 Except I think I'm still<br />a little too petrified to laugh.
3756028 3758963 No, you won't laugh<br />'cause it's not funny.
3759031 3762364 But if you still wanna hear it,<br />I'll tell it.
3762434 3764629 - I can't wait.<br />- Okay.
3764703 3767570 Three tomatoes<br />are walkin' down the street.
3767639 3770073 Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato<br />and Baby Tomato.
3770142 3774306 Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,<br />and Papa Tomato gets really angry.
3774379 3777314 Goes back and squishes him<br />and says,
3777382 3779475 "Ketchup."
3782321 3784255 Ketchup.
3788393 3790520 See you around.
3811583 3815280 Oh, that Paddlefoot.<br />He funny, silly dog.
3815354 3818289 He think totem pole alive!
3818357 3821087 He arctic tenderfoot!
3821159 3825822 That totem pole been here forever!
3825897 3826831 Butch?
3826899 3829766 One more thing, and we'll start for...
3829835 3832770 - Butch, stop watching TV for a second.<br />- Yeah?
3832838 3836467 - You've got a special visitor.<br />- Stand up. Stand up.
3839244 3844181 Now, do you remember when I told you<br />your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp?
3844249 3847980 Well, this here is Captain Koons.
3848053 3850988 He was in the P.O.W. camp<br />with Daddy.
3856328 3858262 Hello, little man.
3858330 3862426 Boy, I sure heard<br />a bunch about you.
3862501 3865732 See, I was a good friend<br />of your dad's.
3865804 3868830 We were in that Hanoi<br />pit of hell together...
3868907 3871375 over five years.
3871443 3873377 Hopefully...
3873445 3876380 you'll never have to<br />experience this yourself,
3876448 3879884 but when two men are in a situation<br />like me and your dad were...
3879952 3882750 for as long as we were,
3882821 3887121 you take on certain responsibilities<br />of the other.
3887192 3889126 If it'd been me who'd...
3890462 3892396 Not made it,
3892464 3896730 Major Coolidge'd be talking right now<br />to my son Jim.
3896802 3900465 But the way it turned out,<br />I'm talking to you.
3901873 3903807 Butch...
3905344 3907278 I got something for ya.
3913785 3915844 This watch I got here...
3915921 3920722 was first purchased by your great-grandfather<br />during the first World War.
3920792 3925456 It was bought in a little general store<br />in Knoxville, Tennessee.
3925530 3929091 Made by the first company<br />to ever make wristwatches.
3929167 3932102 Up 'til then, people just<br />carried pocket watches.
3932170 3935333 It was bought<br />by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...
3935407 3938342 on the day he set sail for Paris.
3938410 3940844 This was your<br />great-grandfather's war watch,
3940912 3944279 and he wore it every day<br />he was in that war, and...
3944349 3947910 when he'd done his duty,<br />he went home to your great-grandmother,
3947986 3952423 took the watch off, put it in an old<br />coffee can, and in that can it stayed...
3952491 3956928 until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,<br />was called upon by his country...
3956995 3960726 to go overseas and fight<br />the Germans once again.
3960799 3964257 This time they called it<br />World War ll.
3964336 3969330 Your great-grandfather gave this watch<br />to your granddad for good luck.
3969408 3972400 Unfortunately, Dane's luck<br />wasn't as good as his old man's.
3972477 3975412 Dane was a Marine,<br />and he was killed...
3975480 3979507 along with all the other Marines<br />at the battle of Wake Island.
3979584 3982519 Your granddad was facing death.
3982587 3984521 He knew it.
3984589 3989125 None of those boys ever had any illusions<br />about ever leaving that island alive,
3989133 3991790 so three days before the Japanese<br />took the island,
3991863 3997096 your granddad asked a gunner on<br />an Air Force transport, name of Winocki...
3997169 4000104 A man he'd never met before<br />in his life...
4000172 4003141 To deliver to his infant son,
4003208 4007804 who he'd never seen in the flesh,<br />his gold watch.
4007879 4012213 Three days later, your granddad<br />was dead, but Winocki kept his word.
4012284 4016550 After the war was over,<br />he paid a visit to your grandmother,
4016621 4020853 delivering to your infant father<br />his dad's gold watch.
4020926 4022860 This watch.
4028734 4034172 This watch was on your daddy's wrist<br />when he was shot down over Hanoi.
4034239 4037675 He was captured,<br />put in a Vietnamese prison camp.
4037743 4041804 He knew that if the gooks<br />ever saw the watch,
4041880 4045407 it'd be confiscated, taken away.
4045484 4049181 The way your dad looked at it,<br />this watch was your birthright.
4049254 4053190 He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their<br />greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright,
4053258 4057194 so he hid it in one place he knew<br />he could hide something... his ass.
4057262 4060698 Five long years<br />he wore this watch up his ass.
4060766 4064964 Then he died of dysentery...<br />He give me the watch.
4065036 4068904 I hid this uncomfortable<br />hunk of metal up my ass two years.
4068974 4070908 Then...
4070976 4075037 after seven years,<br />I was sent home to my family and...
4075113 4077047 now...
4079484 4082419 Iittle man,<br />I give the watch to you.
4105277 4107211 It's time, Butch.
4114953 4117888 In the heavyweight division,
4117956 4121119 in the right corner wearing<br />the blue trunks,
4121193 4124458 weighing 210 pounds,
4124529 4127657 Floyd Ray Wilson!
4130735 4132669 It's official. It's official.
4132737 4135172 - Wilson is dead!<br />- Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest,
4135190 4137774 and hands down, the most brutal fight<br />this city's ever seen.
4137843 4141338 Coolidge was out of there faster than I've<br />ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.
4141363 4144348 - Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?<br />- My guess would be yes, Richard.
4144366 4148352 I could see from my position the frenzy in his eyes<br />give way to the realization of what he was doing.
4148420 4151856 - I think any man would've left the ring that fast.<br />- Dan, do you feel this tragedy...
4151923 4153257 is gonna have an effect<br />on the world of boxing?
4153275 4157361 Oh, Richard, a tragedy like this can't help<br />but shake the world of boxing to its very foundations.
4157429 4161865 But it's of paramount importance, during the sad<br />weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain...
4196701 4199033 Man, you know I didn't...
4199104 4202039 - Marsellus.<br />- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.
4202107 4204041 I didn't do it.
4204109 4206600 - How you doing?<br />- Great.
4206678 4209112 I never thanked you for dinner.
4211016 4212950 - What you got?<br />- He booked.
4213018 4216112 - His trainer?<br />- Says he don't know nothin'. I believe him.
4216187 4219623 - I think Butch surprised his ass same as us.<br />- No, we don't wanna "think."
4219691 4223286 We wanna know. Take him to<br />the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.
4223361 4226297 We'll find out for goddamn sure<br />what he knows and what he don't.
4226305 4228799 Butch's search...<br />How do you want it done?
4228867 4231802 I'm prepared to scour the Earth<br />for that motherfucker.
4231870 4235306 If Butch goes to Indochina,<br />I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...
4235373 4237500 ready to pop a cap in his ass.
4237575 4239712 I will take care of it.
4250455 4251821 Mister.
4254727 4257218 - Hey, mister.<br />- What?
4257296 4262097 You were in that fight,<br />the fight on the radio.
4262168 4265604 - You're the fighter?<br />- Whatever gave you that idea?
4265671 4268435 No, come on.
4268508 4270442 You're him.
4270510 4272944 I know you're him.
4274680 4276580 Tell me you're him.
4276649 4278583 I'm him.
4279685 4282119 You killed the other boxing man.
4285758 4287851 He's dead?
4287927 4290361 The radio said he was dead.
4293132 4295362 Sorry about that, Floyd.
4296669 4299160 What does it feel like?
4299238 4301172 What does what feel like?
4301240 4303174 Killing a man.
4304944 4309005 Beating another man to death<br />with your bare hands.
4309081 4311015 What are you, a weirdo?
4311083 4313017 No.
4313085 4316521 It is a subject<br />I have much interest in.
4318090 4322026 You are the first person<br />I have ever met who has killed somebody.
4324530 4326964 So?
4327033 4330298 What does it feel like to kill a man?
4331404 4333338 I'll tell you what.
4333406 4337342 Give me one of them cigarettes you got up<br />there, and I'll tell you all about it.
4355061 4358292 So, Esmarelda...
4359599 4363000 Villa Lobos...<br />Is that Mexican?
4363069 4366300 The name is Spanish,<br />but I am Colombian.
4366372 4369671 - That's some handle you got there, honey.<br />- Thank you.
4369742 4371676 And what is your name?
4371744 4373439 Butch.
4373513 4375981 Butch.
4376048 4380815 - What does it mean?<br />- I'm an American, honey. Our names don't mean shit.
4380887 4383549 So, moving right along,
4383623 4385557 Esmarelda,
4385625 4387889 what is it you want to know?
4387960 4392829 - I want to know what it feels like to kill a man.<br />- I couldn't tell ya.
4398738 4403175 Didn't know he was dead<br />until you told me he was dead.
4403242 4407838 Now that I know he's dead,<br />you wanna know how I feel about it?
4411584 4415020 I don't feel<br />the least bit bad about it.
4425998 4428432 What the fuck'd I tell ya?<br />Huh?
4428501 4432437 As soon as the word got out the fix was in,<br />man, the odds went through the roof.
4432505 4434700 I know. I know.<br />Unbelievable.
4434774 4438210 Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was<br />a better boxer, he'd still be alive.
4438277 4439511 If he never laced up his gloves,
4439579 4442713 which he never shoulda done in the first<br />fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.
4444784 4448379 Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?<br />It's over now.
4448454 4451389 Yeah, well, enough about the poor,<br />unfortunate Mr. Floyd.
4451457 4455154 Let's talk about the rich<br />and prosperous Mr. Butch.
4455227 4458162 How many bookies did you<br />lay it around on?
4458230 4460664 All eight?<br />How long to collect?
4462301 4465236 So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?<br />No, I understand.
4465304 4468467 A few stragglers aside.<br />Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.
4468541 4470771 That is great news, man.
4470843 4475041 Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne<br />are gonna leave in the morning.
4475114 4478379 It'll probably take us<br />a couple days to get down to Knoxville.
4478451 4480385 Okay, my brother.
4480453 4482421 You're right.
4482488 4484820 You're goddamn right.
4484890 4488382 All right, Scotty, next time I see you,<br />it'll be on Tennessee time.
4488461 4490793 Cool, brother.
4505945 4508379 $45.60.
4511951 4513885 And, uh,
4513953 4517252 here's a little something<br />for the effort.
4517323 4521259 Now, if anybody asks you who your fare<br />was tonight, what are you gonna say?
4521327 4523261 The truth.
4523329 4526821 Three well-dressed,<br />slightly toasted Mexicans.
4528734 4531134 Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos.
4531203 4533728 Buenas Noches, Butch.
4544850 4546784 Whew.
4548154 4550145 Keep the light off.
4550222 4553157 - Is that better, Sugar Pop?<br />- Oui.
4557630 4559564 Hard day at the office?
4559632 4561566 Pretty hard.
4561634 4563864 Got in a fight.
4563936 4566097 Poor baby.
4566172 4568732 Can you make spoons?
4568808 4571743 You know what?<br />I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.
4571811 4575747 - I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.<br />- I like the way you stink.
4575815 4578249 Let me take this jacket off.
4580419 4583946 - I was looking at myself in the mirror.<br />- Uh-huh.
4584023 4585957 I wish I had a pot.
4587727 4591663 You were looking at yourself in the<br />mirror, and you wish you had some pot?
4591731 4594666 A pot.<br />A pot belly.
4594734 4596895 Pot bellies are sexy.
4596969 4599267 Well, you should be happy,
4599338 4601272 'cause you have one.
4601340 4604798 Shut up, fatso.<br />I don't have a pot.
4604877 4608745 I have a bit of a tummy,<br />like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star."
4608814 4610748 It's not the same thing.
4610816 4614752 I didn't know there was such a difference<br />between a pot belly and a tummy.
4614820 4616754 The difference is huge.
4616822 4620258 Would you like it if I had a pot belly?
4620326 4622260 No.
4622328 4626765 Pot bellies make a man<br />look either oafish or like a gorilla.
4626832 4629926 But on a woman<br />a pot belly's very sexy.
4630002 4635440 The rest of you is normal... normal face,<br />normal legs, normal hips, normal ass...
4635508 4639569 But with a big,<br />perfectly round pot belly.
4639645 4642580 If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt<br />two sizes too small...
4642648 4644582 to accentuate it.
4644650 4647084 You think men<br />would find that attractive?
4647153 4650316 I don't give a damn<br />what men find attractive.
4650389 4653847 It's unfortunate what we find pleasing<br />to the touch and pleasing to the eye...
4653926 4655860 is seldom the same.
4659265 4662860 If you had a pot belly,<br />I would punch you in it.
4662935 4665870 - You'd punch me in the belly?<br />- Right in the belly.
4665938 4667872 Ohh! I'd smother you!
4667940 4671876 I'd drop it right on your face<br />'til you couldn't breathe!
4671944 4673878 - You'd do that?<br />- Yeah.
4673946 4675914 - Promise?<br />- Yeah.
4679418 4681352 - Mmm.<br />- Mmm.
4683589 4686023 Oh.
4689461 4691395 Did you get everything?
4691463 4694455 - Yes, I did.<br />- Good job, Sugar Pop.
4694533 4696467 Did everything go as planned?
4696535 4699265 You didn't listen to the... Ow!
4699338 4701272 You didn't listen to the radio?
4701340 4704639 I never listen to your fights.<br />Were you the winner?
4704710 4707008 I won, all right.
4707079 4710048 - Are you still retiring?<br />- Sure am.
4710115 4712481 So it all worked out<br />in the finish.
4713919 4717355 We're not at the finish yet, baby.
4725297 4728164 We're in a lot of danger,<br />aren't we?
4729735 4732670 If they find us,<br />they'll kill us, won't they?
4734740 4737675 But they won't find us,<br />will they?
4740579 4743514 Do you still want me<br />to go with you?
4745084 4748747 I don't want to be a burden<br />or a nuisance. It's...
4755361 4757727 Say it.
4757796 4760390 Fabienne,
4760466 4763594 I want you to be with me.
4763669 4766661 - Forever?<br />- Forever and ever.
4768807 4770775 Do you love me?
4770843 4772834 Very, very much.
4778550 4781110 - Butch.<br />- Yes?
4782554 4785148 Will you give me oral pleasure?
4786659 4788593 Will you kiss it?
4790529 4792724 But you first.
4792798 4795631 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
4805844 4808142 Butch.
4808213 4811649 Mon amour.<br />L'aventure commence.
4827306 4829740 I think I cracked a rib.
4829809 4833245 - Giving me oral pleasure?<br />- No, retard, from the fight.
4833312 4836748 - Don't call me "retard."<br />- My name is Fabby.
4836816 4839307 - My name is Fabienne!<br />- Stop it.
4839385 4841319 - Stop it!<br />- My name is Fabi...
4841387 4844322 Shut up, fuckhead!<br />I hate that mongoloid voice.
4844390 4847484 Okay, okay.<br />Sorry, sorry, sorry.
4847560 4850495 I take it back.
4852498 4855433 Will you hand me a dry towel,<br />Miss Beautiful Tulip?
4855501 4859437 Oh, I like that.<br />I like being called a tulip.
4859505 4861939 "Tulip" is much better<br />than "mongoloid."
4862007 4864942 I didn't call you a mongoloid.<br />I called you a retard.
4865010 4867137 And I took it back.
4867213 4869306 Butch?
4869381 4871315 Yes, Lemon Pie?
4871383 4874819 - Where are we going to go?<br />- Well, I'm not sure yet.
4874887 4877014 Wherever you want.
4877089 4878924 We're gonna get a lot<br />of money from this,
4879092 4881027 but it ain't gonna be<br />the kind of money...
4881095 4886030 that we can live like hogs<br />in the fathouse forever.
4886098 4890034 I was thinking maybe we could go<br />down someplace in the South Pacific.
4890102 4893538 Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna<br />carry us a long way down there.
4893606 4896541 - If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?<br />- You betcha.
4896609 4900045 And if after a while you didn't<br />dig that, we could go someplace else.
4900112 4902046 Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.
4902114 4904048 But I do not speak Spanish.
4904116 4907085 Well, you do not speak<br />Bora-Boran either.
4907153 4909121 Besides, Mexican's easy.
4909188 4912123 - ¿Donde esta el zapateria?<br />- What does that mean?
4912191 4914125 Where is the shoe store?
4914193 4916127 - ¿Donde esta...<br />- Spit, please.
4918197 4921462 - ¿Donde esta el zapateria?<br />- Excellent pronunciation.
4921534 4923559 Mmm.
4923636 4926935 You'll be my little mamacita<br />in no time.
4927006 4929531 - ¿Que hora es?<br />- ¿Que hora es?
4929608 4931769 - What time is it?<br />- What time is it?
4931844 4934472 Time for bed.
4934547 4936481 Sweet dreams, jellybean.
4944190 4946124 Butch?
4952031 4953965 Never mind.
4960940 4963568 Aah!
4963642 4967703 Merde! You startled me.<br />Did you have a bad dream?
4978157 4982423 - What is this you're watching?<br />- A motorcycle movie.
4982494 4984428 I'm not sure the name.
4986332 4989426 - Are you watching it?<br />- In a way.
4991237 4995333 It's a little early in the morning<br />for explosions and war.
4998177 5002614 - What was it about?<br />- How should I know? You were the one watching it.
5002681 5006674 - No, imbecile, what was your dream about?<br />- I don't know.
5006752 5008686 I don't remember.
5008754 5011689 It's really rare<br />that I remember my dreams.
5011757 5014726 Well, let's look<br />at the grumpy man in the morning.
5016795 5019730 Why don't you get up<br />and we'll get some breakfast.
5019798 5022426 One more kiss, and I'll get up.
5024570 5027801 - Satisfied?<br />- Yep.
5027873 5031309 - Get up, lazy bones!<br />- Ohh!
5031377 5034437 Ohh. God.
5035748 5039275 - What time is it?<br />- Almost nine in the morning.
5039351 5043117 - What time does our train arrive?<br />- Eleven.
5043188 5047557 - You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast?<br />- What, Lemon Pie?
5047626 5051756 I'm gonna order a big plate<br />of blueberry pancakes...
5051830 5053764 with maple syrup,
5053832 5057268 eggs over easy<br />and five sausages.
5057336 5059531 Anything to drink with that?
5059605 5063268 Wow, that looks nice.
5063342 5066675 To drink... A tall glass<br />of orange juice...
5066745 5069179 and a black cup of coffee.
5069248 5073810 - After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.<br />- Pie for breakfast?
5073886 5077822 Any time of the<br />day is a good time for pie.
5077890 5080825 Blueberry pie<br />to go with the pancakes.
5080893 5083885 And on top, a thin slice<br />of melted cheese.
5083962 5085896 Where's my watch?
5090369 5092633 It's there.
5092705 5095299 - No, it's not.<br />- Have you looked?
5095374 5099640 Yes, I've fuckin' looked.<br />What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?
5099712 5101839 You sure you got it?
5101914 5104212 Yes.<br />Bedside table drawer.
5104283 5107446 - On the little kangaroo?<br />- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.
5107519 5110682 Yeah, well, it's not here now.
5110756 5113623 Well, it should be.
5113692 5117492 Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's<br />not here now! So where the fuck is it?
5123068 5126504 Fabienne,<br />where's my father's fucking watch?
5128173 5132610 Do you have any idea what he had<br />to go through to get me that watch?
5132678 5135013 I don't have time to go into it,<br />but he went through a lot.
5135081 5141017 All this other shit you could've set on fire,<br />but I specifically reminded you not to forget the fucking watch.
5141086 5142417 Now think.
5142488 5146015 - Did you get it?<br />- I believe so.
5146091 5149356 "You believe so"? What the fuck does that mean?<br />You either did or didn't get it.
5150763 5152697 Then I did.
5154066 5156000 Are you sure?
5157102 5159036 No.
5161140 5163074 Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
5163142 5165508 Motherfucker!<br />Motherfuckin'...
5167413 5170211 Do you know how fucking stupid<br />you fucking are?
5170282 5172216 No!
5174853 5176787 It's not your fault.
5181593 5184027 You left it at the apartment.
5189601 5193037 If you left it at the apartment,<br />it's not your fault.
5195107 5198235 I had you bring<br />a bunch of stuff.
5200446 5202380 I reminded you about it,
5202448 5207215 but I didn't illustrate<br />how personal the watch was to me.
5207286 5211313 If all I gave a fuck about was the watch,<br />I shoulda told you that.
5211390 5213824 You're not a mind reader.
5213892 5215826 Are you?
5225971 5227905 I... I'm sorry.
5227973 5231568 Don't be. Just means<br />I can't have breakfast with you.
5231643 5234339 Why does it mean that?
5236915 5240248 Because I gotta go back to my apartment<br />and get my watch.
5241453 5243978 Won't the gangsters<br />be looking for you there?
5244056 5248322 Well, that's what<br />I'm gonna find out.
5248393 5251624 If they are, and I don't think<br />I can handle it,
5251697 5253631 then I'll split.
5253699 5257999 I saw your watch. I thought<br />I brought it. I'm so sorry.
5263275 5266335 Here's some money.<br />Go out and get those pancakes.
5266411 5268276 Have a nice breakfast.
5268347 5271783 I'll take your Honda. I'll be back<br />before you can say "blueberry pie."
5271850 5274284 Blueberry pie.
5274353 5276514 Maybe not that fast.
5276588 5279785 - But pretty fast. Okay?<br />- Okay.
5279858 5282190 - Bye.<br />- Bye.
5282261 5285196 Shit! Of all the fuckin' things<br />she could fuckin' forget,
5285264 5287198 she forgets my father's watch!
5287266 5289200 I specifically reminded her...
5289268 5291395 Bedside table, on the kangaroo.
5291470 5294735 I said the words-<br />"Don't forget my father's watch."
5310222 5313658 Visit the<br />Jackrabbit Slim's nearest you...
5323802 5327966 I EI burro!
5451641 5453575 Lookin' good, Butch.
5622678 5624737 If I were walkin' in your shoes
5632288 5637726 Countin' flowers on the wall<br />That don't bother me at all
5637793 5642230 Playin' solitaire 'til dawn<br />with a deck of fifty-one
5642298 5645233 That's how you're gonna<br />beat 'em, Butch.
5645301 5648532 - Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo<br />- They keep underestimatin' ya.
5648604 5650538 Now don't tell me
5652108 5655566 Countin' flowers on the wall
5655645 5659103 That don't bother me at all
5659181 5664710 Playin' solitaire 'til dawn<br />with a deck of fifty-one
5664787 5669520 Smokin' cigarettes<br />and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
5669592 5672493 Now don't tell me
5672562 5674996 I've nothin' to do
5675064 5677362 It's good to see you I must go
5677433 5679492 I know I look a fright
5679569 5682037 - Anyway my eyes<br />- Motherfucker!
5682104 5684470 - Are not accustomed...<br />- Uhh!
5692648 5695082 - Do you think he's dead?<br />- He's dead.
5695151 5697381 - Oh, my God.<br />- He's dead.
5707263 5711199 If you need someone to go to court, I'll be glad to help, okay.<br />That guy was a drunken maniac.
5711267 5714202 He hit you, then he<br />crashed into that car.
5714270 5716204 - Who?<br />- Him.
5720276 5722471 I'll be damned.
5738127 5740425 Aaaah! I'm shot!
5747236 5750637 Sally! Sally!
5754143 5756077 Aaah!
5758414 5760348 Motherfucker!
5762985 5766443 - Can I help you with somethin'?<br />- Shut the fuck up.
5766522 5769457 Now you just wait<br />a goddamn minute, now!
5769525 5771493 What the fuck you up to?
5771560 5774188 Come here, motherfucker!
5774263 5777164 You feel that sting, big boy, huh?
5777233 5779167 That's pride<br />fuckin' with you, see?
5779235 5782671 You gotta fight through that shit!<br />Huh?
5782738 5785730 - You'd better kill me...<br />- Yeah, somebody's gonna get killed.
5785808 5788368 Somebody's gonna get<br />their motherfuckin' head blown to...
5788444 5790969 Hold it right there, goddamn it.
5791047 5794813 - This ain't none of your business, mister.<br />- I'm makin' it my business.
5794884 5797614 - Toss the weapon.<br />- You don't understand, man.
5797687 5799712 Toss the weapon.
5801791 5804954 It's time
5805027 5807723 - To find love<br />- Take your foot off the nigger,
5807797 5809731 put your hand behind your head,
5809799 5811858 approach the counter right now.
5811934 5813959 This motherfucker's trying to...
5814036 5815367 kill me.
5815438 5819204 Shut up.<br />Keep comin'. Come on.
5820710 5824237 If love
5824313 5826247 Is shelter
5843799 5845733 Zed. Maynard.
5846902 5849837 Yeah, the spider<br />just caught a couple flies.
5849905 5853341 Whoa, my angel
5855911 5858613 Down to you
5858614 5859046 Down to you
5897675 5900610 Nobody kills anybody<br />in my place of business...
5900678 5903613 except me or Zed.
5905883 5907817 That's Zed.
5920465 5923901 - I thought you said you waited for me.<br />- I did.
5928206 5931141 Then how come they're all beat up?
5931209 5935475 They did that to each other, man.<br />They came in fightin'.
5935546 5939880 Now, this 'un right here,<br />he was gonna shoot that one.
5939951 5943318 Is that right?<br />You gonna shoot him, boy?
5943387 5945981 Huh?
5947992 5951052 Hey, is Grace<br />all right out front?
5951128 5954359 - Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?<br />- No, it's Thursday.
5954432 5957026 - She oughta be fine.<br />- Mmm.
5958503 5962769 Well, bring out the Gimp.
5963875 5966605 I think the Gimp's sleepin'.
5966677 5970613 Then I guess you'll just have to go<br />wake him up now, won't you?

6024936 6026870 Get down.
6036948 6039883 Which one of 'em<br />you wanna do first?

6410397 6413332 What now?
6415669 6417603 "What now"?
6418973 6422409 Let me tell you what now.
6422476 6425411 I'm gonna call a couple of hard,<br />pipe-hittin' niggers...
6425479 6428414 to go to work<br />on the homes here...
6428482 6431417 with a pair of pliers<br />and a blowtorch.
6433387 6436083 You hear me talkin',<br />hillbilly boy?
6437358 6439918 I ain't through with you<br />by a damn sight!
6439994 6442929 I'm gonna get medieval<br />on your ass.
6446200 6449135 I meant what now<br />between me and you.
6454208 6456608 Oh, that "what now."
6458045 6461981 I tell you what now between me and you.
6463550 6466485 There is no me and you.
6467921 6469855 Not no more.
6472926 6474860 So, are we cool?
6476230 6478528 Yeah, we cool.
6478599 6480726 Two things.
6482503 6485438 Don't tell nobody about this.
6486907 6490536 This shit is between me, you...
6490611 6495071 and Mr. "Soon-To-Be-Livin' The-Rest-Of-His-Short-Ass-<br />Life-In-Agonizing-Pain"...
6495149 6497083 rapist here.
6498385 6501149 It ain't nobody else's business.
6501314 6502614 Two...
6503223 6506715 You leave town tonight.<br />Right now.
6507961 6509895 And when you gone,
6509963 6511897 you stay gone,
6511965 6514900 or you be gone.
6514968 6517903 You lost all your L.A. privileges.<br />Deal?
6519740 6521674 Deal.
6522910 6524844 Get your ass outta here.
6552385 6554255 Oh, shit.
6586555 6588989 Fabienne!
6590058 6592993 Fabienne!
6594229 6596322 Fabienne!<br />Come on, baby.
6596398 6599834 - Come on. Get your shit. We gotta go right now.<br />- I was so worried.
6599901 6603337 - What about our bags?<br />- Fuck the bags; if we don't split right now, we'll miss the train.
6603405 6605339 - I'll be downstairs.<br />- Is everything well?
6605407 6609343 - Just come on! No talking now!<br />- Are we in danger?
6612848 6614782 Come on, honey!
6616852 6619320 Where did you get<br />this motorcycle?
6619388 6623916 - It's not a motorcycle, baby. It's a chopper. Come on, let's go.<br />- What happened to my Honda?
6623992 6627758 I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that Honda.<br />Will you come on now, please?
6627829 6630229 Come on. Let's go,<br />let's go, let's go.
6634803 6638639 - You're hurt?<br />- No, no, I might've broken my nose. It's no biggie.
6638707 6641242 Come on. Hop on.<br />Baby, please, we...
6641310 6644245 Honey, we gotta hit<br />the fuckin' road! Get on!
6645914 6649350 Oh, baby, I'm sorry. Come here, come here.
6649418 6651352 I'm sorry. Mmm.
6651420 6656156 - I'm so sorry.<br />- You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts.
6656224 6658359 Oh, I'm sorry sweetie. I didn't mean<br />to worry you. Everything's fine.
6658427 6660361 - How was your breakfast?<br />- It was good.
6660429 6662363 Did you get the pancakes?<br />The blueberry pancakes?
6662431 6665867 They didn't have blueberry pancakes;<br />I had to get buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?
6665935 6668570 Honey, since I left you,<br />this has been, without a doubt,
6668638 6671869 the single weirdest fuckin' day of my life...<br />Hop on, I'll tell you all about it.
6671881 6674606 Come on. Get on.<br />Gotta go. Gotta go. Come on.
6674676 6677440 Butch, whose motorcycle is this?
6677512 6680106 - It's a chopper, baby.<br />- Whose chopper is this?
6680182 6682116 - Zed's.<br />- Who's Zed?
6682184 6684744 Zed's dead, baby.<br />Zed's dead.
6700936 6703234 Yes, you did, Brett!
6703305 6707532 You tried to fuck him,<br />and Marsellus Wallace don't liked to be fucked...
6707608 6709742 by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
6709811 6712505 - Oh, God, please. I don't wanna die. Please.<br />- You read the Bible, Brett?
6712581 6716517 - Yes!<br />- Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
6716584 6718245 Sorta fits the occasion.
6718320 6721619 Ezekiel 25:17.
6721690 6725990 "The path of the righteous man<br />is beset on all sides..."
6726061 6727995 by the inequities<br />of the selfish...
6728063 6731499 and the tyranny of evil men.
6731566 6736230 Blessed is he who, in the name<br />of charity and good will,
6736304 6739330 shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness,
6739408 6741933 for he is truly<br />his brother's keeper...
6742010 6744740 and the finder of lost children.
6744813 6749079 And I will strike down upon thee<br />with great vengeance...
6749151 6751312 and furious anger...
6751386 6755789 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy My brothers.
6755857 6759725 And you will know<br />My name is the Lord...
6759795 6763196 "when I lay My vengeance<br />upon thee."
6771273 6773707 Oh, fuck. I'm fucked.<br />Oh, fuck.
6773775 6776710 - Is he a friend of yours?<br />- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.
6776778 6779713 Hmm? Oh.<br />Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.
6779781 6782716 - Better tell him to shut up. He's gettin' on my nerves.<br />- Fuck.
6782784 6786781 Marvin. Marvin!<br />I'd knock that shit off if I was you.
6787214 6790218 Die, you motherfuckers! Die!
6818386 6821822 Why the fuck didn't you tell us<br />somebody was in the bathroom?
6821890 6824757 Slip your mind?<br />Did you forget that someone was in there...
6824826 6826760 with a goddamn hand cannon?
6826828 6830764 You see the size of that gun he fired at us?<br />It was bigger than him.
6835537 6838233 We should be fuckin' dead, man.
6838306 6840240 I know.<br />We was lucky.
6840308 6843436 No, no, no, no.<br />That shit wasn't luck.
6843512 6847710 - Yeah, maybe.<br />- This was divine intervention.
6847782 6849716 You know what<br />divine intervention is?
6855590 6857524 I think so.
6857592 6861028 That means that God came down<br />from Heaven and stopped the bullets.
6861096 6863530 That's right.<br />That's exactly what it means.
6863598 6866567 God came down from Heaven<br />and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.
6867802 6869793 I think it's time for us<br />to leave, Jules.
6869871 6872305 Don't do that.<br />Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!
6872374 6876310 - What just happened here was a fuckin' miracle!<br />- Chill, Jules. This shit happens.
6876378 6879142 Wrong! Wrong.<br />This shit doesn't "just happen."
6879214 6882650 Do you want to continue<br />this theological discussion in a car...
6882717 6885151 or in a jailhouse with the cops?
6885220 6887848 We should be fuckin' dead,<br />my friend!
6887923 6892155 What happened here was a miracle,<br />and I want you to fucking acknowledge it!
6892227 6896926 All right, it was a miracle.<br />Can we go now?
6903939 6907306 Let's go, nigger!<br />Come on! Shit.
6910286 6911683 You ever seen that show Cops?
6912114 6913989 I was watching it one time,<br />and there was this cop on,
6914057 6917993 and he was talkin' about this gunfight he<br />had in the hallway with this guy, right?
6918061 6921519 He just unloaded on this guy and nothin' happened.<br />He didn't hit nothin'.
6921598 6924533 Okay? It was just<br />him and this guy.
6924601 6927934 I mean, you know, it's,<br />it's freaky, but it happens.
6928004 6932941 You wanna play blind man, go walk with the shepherd,<br />but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.
6933009 6935944 - What the fuck does that mean?<br />- It means that's it for me.
6936012 6938708 From here on in,<br />you can consider my ass retired.
6938782 6940943 - Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.<br />- Don't blaspheme.
6941017 6944077 - I said, don't do that!<br />- Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us?
6944154 6947214 Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today...<br />I'm through.
6947290 6950225 - Why don't you tell him at the same time why?<br />- Don't worry, I will.
6950293 6954286 - Yeah, and I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass off.<br />- I don't give a damn if he does.
6955550 6958170 Marvin, what do you make of all this?
6958650 6960194 Man, I don't even<br />have an opinion.
6960157 6964568 Well, you gotta have an opinion.<br />I mean do you think that God came down from Heaven and stopped...
6965598 6966653 What the fuck's happenin'?
6966745 6968384 - Aw, shit, man!<br />- Aw, man!
6968511 6971446 - Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.<br />- Why the fuck'd you do that?
6971514 6973448 I didn't mean to do.<br />It was an accident.
6973516 6976451 - Oh, man, I seen some crazy-ass shit in my time, but this...<br />- Chill out, man!
6976519 6979454 I told you it was an accident.<br />We probably went over a bump or somethin'.
6979522 6980856 The car ain't hit<br />no motherfuckin' bump.
6980884 6984857 Hey, look man, I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch.<br />The gun went off. I don't know why.
6984928 6988364 Look at this fuckin' mess, man!<br />We're on a city street in broad daylight here!
6988431 6990466 - I don't believe it!<br />- Well, believe it now, motherfucker!
6990534 6994892 We gotta get this car off the road. You know cops tend to<br />notice shit like you're driving a car drenched in fucking blood.
6994971 6997906 - Just take it to a friendly place, that's all!<br />- This is the Valley, Vincent.
6997974 6999508 Marsellus ain't got<br />no friendly places in the Valley.
6999577 7003412 - Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man!<br />- Shit!
7003480 7005815 - What you doing?<br />- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.
7005883 7010010 - Where's Toluca Lake?<br />- It's just over the hill here, over by Burbank Studios.
7010086 7013021 If Jimmie's ass ain't home,<br />I don't know what the fuck we gonna do, man,
7013089 7016024 'cause I ain't got<br />no other partners in 818.
7016092 7019027 Jimmie, how you doin', man?<br />It's Jules. Just listen up, man.
7019095 7023031 Me and my homeboy are in some serious fuckin' shit, man.<br />We're in a car, and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.
7023099 7025294 I need to use your garage<br />for a couple hours.
7026803 7029738 We gotta be real fuckin' delicate<br />with this Jimmie situation.
7029806 7032805 He's one remark away<br />from kickin' our asses out the door.
7032810 7036445 - If he does, what do we do?<br />- Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made a couple calls,
7036513 7039008 but I don't want it to reach that pitch...<br />Jimmie's a friend.
7039016 7041751 You don't come into your friend's house<br />and start tellin' him what's what.
7041819 7044453 Well, just tell him not to be abusive,<br />that's all.
7044521 7046455 He kinda freaked out back there<br />when he saw Marvin.
7046523 7049686 Put yourself in his position...<br />It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.
7049759 7051693 He wasn't expectin' this shit.
7051761 7054696 Shit. We gotta remember here<br />who's doin' who a favor.
7054764 7058700 If that favor means I gotta take shit,<br />he can stick that favor straight up his ass. I don't care.
7058768 7062704 - Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do to his towel, man?<br />- I was dryin' my hands!
7062772 7065707 - You're supposed to wash 'em first!<br />- You watched me wash 'em.
7065775 7069336 - I watched you get 'em wet.<br />- I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.
7069412 7071346 Maybe if he'd had Lava<br />I coulda done a better job.
7071414 7072998 I used the same<br />fuckin' soap you did,
7073006 7076351 and when I finished, the towel<br />didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!
7076419 7078954 What if he was to come in here<br />and see his towel like this, Vincent?
7079002 7083518 It's shit like this that's gonna bring<br />this situation to a head, man!
7083593 7087029 Look, I ain't threatenin' you<br />or nothin', all right?
7087097 7091557 You know I respect you and all.<br />But just don't put me in this position, all right?
7091634 7094330 All right.<br />Fine. Fine.
7094404 7097339 Ask me nice like that,<br />no problem.
7097407 7100342 Just go handle your friend.<br />Go ahead. I don't care.
7102078 7104945 Mmm! Goddamn, Jimmie!
7105015 7107108 This some serious gourmet shit.
7107183 7109117 Me and Vincent<br />would've been satisfied...
7109185 7111153 with some freeze-dried<br />Taster's Choice.
7111221 7113155 Right?
7113223 7116158 And he springs this<br />serious gourmet shit on us.
7116226 7118285 - What flavor is this?<br />- Knock it off, Julie.
7118361 7122388 - What?<br />- I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is. Okay?
7122465 7124956 I'm the one who buys it.<br />I know how good it is.
7125035 7126969 When Bonnie goes shopping,<br />she buys shit.
7127037 7130666 I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause<br />when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
7130740 7134676 But you know what's on my mind right now?<br />It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.
7134744 7136905 It's the dead nigger<br />in my garage.
7136980 7141416 - Jimmie, don't even worry...<br />- Don't tell me about anything. I wanna ask you a question.
7141483 7142417 When you came pulling in here,
7142485 7145682 did you notice the sign on the front of my<br />house that said, "Dead Nigger Storage"?
7145755 7149691 - Jimmie, you know I ain't seen no shit...<br />- Did you notice the sign on the front of my house...
7149759 7151193 that said,<br />"Dead Nigger Storage"?
7151261 7153991 No. I didn't.
7154064 7156999 - You know why you didn't see that sign?<br />- Why?
7157067 7161595 'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead<br />niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!
7161671 7164606 - Jimmie, we're not gonna store the motherfucker...<br />- No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't you fuckin' realize, man...
7164674 7169111 that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead<br />body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?
7169179 7172410 Alright, no marriage counselor. No trial separation.<br />I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.
7172482 7175849 Okay? And I don't wanna<br />get fuckin' divorced!
7175919 7180913 Man, you know, fuck, I mean I wanna help you,<br />but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it. Alright?
7180990 7183083 Jimmie, Jimmie,<br />she ain't gonna leave you.
7183159 7187095 Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!<br />Okay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.
7187163 7191622 There's nothin' that you're gonna say that's gonna<br />make me forget that I love my wife. Is there?
7194270 7198934 Now, look, you know, she comes home<br />from work in about an hour and a half.
7199008 7202068 The graveyard shift<br />at the hospital.
7202145 7205205 You gotta make some phone calls?<br />You gotta call some people?
7205281 7209217 Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck<br />out of my house before she gets here.
7209285 7212220 That's Kool and the Gang.<br />We don't wanna fuck your shit up.
7212288 7215257 All I wanna do is call my people<br />and get 'em to bring us in. That's all.
7215325 7218260 You don't wanna fuck my shit up?<br />You're fucking my shit up right now!
7218328 7221422 You're gonna fuck my shit up<br />big time if Bonnie comes home.
7221498 7224990 So just do me that favor, alright?<br />The phone is in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.
7225068 7228003 Well, say she comes home.
7228071 7230505 What do you think she'll do?
7232008 7234442 Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.
7234511 7236706 That ain't no kinda answer.
7236779 7239839 I mean, you know, I don't.<br />How much? A lot or a little?
7239916 7243183 You got to appreciate<br />what an explosive element...
7243202 7244786 this Bonnie situation is.
7244854 7248790 She comes home from a hard day's work,<br />finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen...
7248858 7250792 doing a bunch of gangster shit,
7250860 7253920 there ain't no tellin'<br />what she's liable to do.
7256099 7258033 Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.
7258101 7260695 All I'm doing is<br />contemplating the ifs.
7260770 7263405 I don't wanna hear about<br />no motherfuckin' ifs!
7263473 7267709 All I want to hear from your ass is,<br />"You ain't got no problem, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker."
7267777 7271941 Go back in there. Chill them niggers out<br />and wait for the cavalry, which should be coming directly."
7272015 7275178 You ain't got no problem, Jules.
7275251 7277378 I'm on the motherfucker.
7277453 7282516 Go back in there and chill them niggers out<br />and wait for the Wolf, who should be coming directly.
7282592 7285026 You sendin' the Wolf?
7285094 7287289 Oh, you feel better,<br />motherfucker?
7287363 7289627 Shit, yeah, negro!
7289699 7292827 That's all you had to say!
7292902 7296099 She the hysterical type?
7296172 7299107 When is she due?
7299175 7301268 Mm-hmm.
7301344 7303278 Give me<br />the principals' names again.
7303346 7305280 Place your bets.
7306349 7310012 - Jules. Mm-hmm.<br />- Cards, please.
7310086 7312020 Vincent.
7316759 7318693 Jimmie.
7319929 7322056 Bonnie. Mm-hmm.
7327470 7330567 It's thirty minutes away.<br />I'll be there in ten.
7347384 7350319 You're... Jimmie, right?<br />This is your house?
7350387 7354016 - It sure is.<br />- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.
7354091 7357026 - Good. We got one.<br />- So I heard. May I come in?
7357094 7359028 Uh, yeah. Please do.
7359096 7362759 You must be Jules.<br />Which would make you... Vincent.
7362833 7365267 Let's get down<br />to brass tacks, gentlemen.
7365335 7368270 If I was informed correctly, the clock<br />is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?
7368338 7369592 Uh, one hundred percent.
7369640 7374276 - Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the a.m., is that correct?<br />- Uh-huh.
7374344 7378838 I was led to believe if she comes home and finds<br />us here, she wouldn't appreciate it too much.
7378915 7383215 - She wouldn't at that.<br />- That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge,
7383287 7386723 which, if you do what I say,<br />when I say it, should be plenty.
7386790 7391124 Now, you got a corpse in a car,<br />minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.
7398869 7400803 - Jimmie.<br />- Uh-huh.
7400871 7404307 Do me a favor, will ya?<br />Thought I smelled some coffee back there.
7404374 7407810 - Would you make me a cup?<br />- Uh, yeah, sure.
7409279 7412214 Oh, uh, um, how do you take it?
7412282 7414842 Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
7416920 7420356 About the car, is there anything<br />I need to know? Does it stall?
7420424 7423500 Does it smoke? Does it make a lot of noise?<br />Is there gas in it? Anything.
7423527 7427363 - Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.<br />- Positive?
7427431 7430427 Don't get me on the road and I find out<br />the brake lights don't work.
7430434 7434995 - Hey, man. As far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top.<br />- Good enough.
7435072 7437097 Let's go back to the kitchen.
7442746 7445681 - Here you go, Mr. Wolf.<br />- Thank you, Jimmie.
7450520 7452454 Mmm.
7453523 7455650 Okay, first thing.<br />You two.
7455726 7458661 Take the body,<br />stick it in the trunk.
7458729 7461059 Now Jimmie, this looks to be<br />a pretty domesticated house.
7461243 7463025 That would lead me to believe that in the garage,<br />under the sink...
7463073 7465832 - you got a bunch of cleaners and cleansers and shit like that?<br />- Yeah, yeah, Mr. Wolf. Under the sink.
7466038 7468971 Good. I need you two fellas to do<br />is take those cleaning products...
7469039 7473066 and clean the inside of the car...<br />I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.
7473143 7477079 You need to go in the back seat, scoop up all<br />those little pieces of brain and skull.
7477147 7479682 Get it out of there.<br />Wipe down the upholstery.
7479690 7483085 Now when it comes to the upholstery, it don't need to be<br />spick-and-span. You don't need to eat off it.
7483153 7487522 Just give it a good once-over.<br />What you need to take care of are the really messy parts.
7487591 7491687 The pools of blood that have collected,<br />you gotta soak that shit up.
7491762 7494196 Jimmie, we need to raid<br />your linen closet.
7494264 7497199 I need blankets, I need comforters,<br />I need quilts, I need bedspreads.
7497267 7500896 The thicker the better, the darker the better.<br />No whites. Can't use 'em.
7500971 7506273 We'll need to camouflage the interior of the car.<br />We're gonna line the front seat and the back seat and floorboards...
7506343 7508277 with quilts and blankets,
7508345 7512281 so if a cop stops us, starts stickin' his big snout<br />in the car, the subterfuge won't last,
7512349 7515216 but at a glance the car<br />will appear to be normal.
7515285 7517344 Jimmie, lead the way.<br />Boys, get to work.
7517421 7519184 "Please" would be nice.
7520657 7523592 - Come again?<br />- I said, a "please" would be nice.
7525495 7529329 Get it straight, buster. I'm not here to say please.<br />I'm here to tell you what to do.
7531134 7533569 And if self-preservation<br />is an instinct you possess,
7533577 7536571 you'd better fuckin' do it<br />and do it quick.
7536640 7540542 I'm here to help. If my help's<br />not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.
7540610 7543943 No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;<br />your help is definitely appreciated.
7544014 7547549 Mr. Wolf, listen.<br />I don't mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.
7547567 7549815 I just don't like people<br />barkin' orders at me, that's all.
7549886 7552946 If I'm curt with you,<br />it's because time is a factor.
7553023 7557653 I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys<br />to act fast if you wanna get out of this.
7557727 7561163 So pretty please, with sugar on top,<br />clean the fuckin' car.
7565669 7569332 Don't be lookin' at me like that,<br />all right? I can feel your look.
7572042 7574738 It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
7576813 7578747 Green.
7580350 7583285 Nothin' except for<br />the mess inside.
7585489 7587923 Mmm, about 20 minutes.
7589426 7591360 Nobody who'll be missed.
7593430 7596365 You're a good man, Joe.<br />Thanks a bunch.
7597467 7599401 - How we comin', Jimmie?<br />- Pretty good.
7599469 7602632 I got it all here, but, uh,
7602706 7606142 - Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.<br />- Winston, Jimmie, Winston.
7606209 7609736 Okay. You gotta<br />understand something, uh, Winston.
7609813 7611747 Uh... Uh, no,<br />thank you.
7611815 7614943 Uh, this is our best linen here,
7615018 7617953 and it's, uh...<br />It was a wedding present...
7618021 7620455 from my Uncle Conrad<br />and my Aunt Ginny.
7620524 7624961 - And they're not with us anymore. I wanna help...<br />- Let me ask you a question, Jimmie.
7625028 7627963 - If you don't mind.<br />- No, no, please. Go ahead.
7629533 7634436 Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,<br />were they millionaires?
7635572 7637506 No.
7637574 7640008 Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.
7640076 7643534 And I'm positive that if<br />Uncle Conrad and Aunt...
7643613 7646047 - Ginny.<br />- Ginny were here,
7646116 7650382 they would furnish you<br />with a whole bedroom set,
7650453 7653581 which your Uncle Marsellus<br />is more than happy to do.
7657561 7661497 I like oak myself.<br />That's what I have in my bedroom.
7662632 7664566 How about you, Jimmie?
7665802 7667736 You an oak man?
7668838 7670772 Oak's nice.
7676613 7680481 Oh, man, I will never<br />forgive your ass for this shit.
7680550 7682984 This is some fucked-up,<br />repugnant shit.
7683053 7686489 Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy<br />that once a man admits he is wrong...
7686556 7689491 that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings?<br />Have you ever heard that?
7689559 7691794 Get the fuck out my face<br />with that shit!
7691902 7695129 The motherfucker that said that shit never<br />had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...
7695198 7699264 - on account of your dumb ass.<br />- I got a threshold, Jules, I got a threshold for the abuse that I will take.
7699336 7702931 Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,<br />and you got me in the red.
7703006 7706442 I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous<br />to have a race car in the fuckin' red.
7706509 7708443 That's all.<br />I could blow.
7708511 7710445 - Oh, you ready to blow?<br />- Yeah, I'm ready to blow.
7710513 7713448 Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'<br />motherfucker, motherfucker.
7713516 7716451 Every time my fingers touch brain,<br />I'm Superfly T.N.T.
7716519 7718453 I'm the Guns of the Navarone.
7718521 7721456 In fact, what the fuck<br />am I doin' in the back?
7721524 7724755 You the motherfucker should be on brain detail!<br />We're fuckin' switchin'.
7724828 7727262 I'm washin' the windows,<br />and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull!
7737040 7738974 Fine job, gentlemen.
7740310 7742744 You may get out of this yet.
7742812 7745246 I can't believe<br />this is the same car.
7745315 7748751 Well, let's not start suckin'<br />each other's dicks quite yet.
7748818 7752254 Phase one is complete... Clean the car...<br />Which moves us right along to Phase two:
7752322 7754256 Clean you two.
7755825 7757690 Strip.
7757761 7761527 - All the way?<br />- To your bare ass.
7761598 7764692 Quickly, gentlemen.<br />We got about 15 minutes...
7764768 7767703 before Jimmie's better half<br />comes pulling into the driveway.
7767771 7770262 Goddamn, this morning air<br />is some chilly shit.
7770340 7772293 Are you sure this is<br />absolutely necessary?
7772427 7774725 - You know what you two look like?<br />- What?
7774796 7778232 Like a couple of guys<br />who just blew off somebody's head.
7778299 7781666 Strippin' off those bloody rags<br />is absolutely necessary.
7785974 7788442 Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.
7788509 7792946 Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit out front for<br />the garbageman to pick up. You know what I'm sayin'?
7793014 7797246 Don't worry, we're taking it with us.<br />Jim, the soap.
7798686 7800620 - Vincent.<br />- Okay, gentlemen.
7800688 7804180 You both been to County before,<br />I'm sure. Here it comes.
7804258 7807193 - Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!<br />- Yo! Yo! Yo!
7807261 7810492 Better you than me, gentlemen.
7810565 7813500 Don't be afraid of the soap.<br />Spread it around.
7813568 7816435 - Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's hair.<br />- Hey, man. Get this shit out of my hair!
7816504 7819405 - Come on. Do it, goddamn it! Do it!<br />- Uh, um...
7820475 7822409 Towel.
7832920 7836083 You're dry enough.<br />Toss 'em their clothes.
7838157 7839422 Perfect.
7839494 7842952 Perfect. We couldn't have<br />planned this better.
7843031 7844965 You guys look like...
7845033 7847467 What do they look like, Jimmie?
7847535 7851130 Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.
7851205 7854697 Ha-ha-ha.<br />They're your clothes, motherfucker.
7854776 7857506 Come on, gentlemen.<br />We're laughing our way right into prison.
7857578 7859512 Don't make me beg.
7862583 7866019 Okay, gentlemen,<br />let's get our rules of the road straight.
7866087 7869648 We're going to a place<br />called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.
7869724 7872659 Now, Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel<br />are sympathetic to our dilemma.
7872727 7874627 The place is North Hollywood,
7874695 7878688 so a few twists and turns aside,<br />we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.
7878766 7882099 Now, I'll drive the tainted car.<br />Jules, you ride with me.
7883504 7885438 Vincent, you follow in my Acura.
7885506 7889442 Now, if we come across the path<br />of any John Q. Laws,
7889510 7892604 - nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something.<br />- Right.
7892680 7895615 - What did I say?<br />- Don't do shit unless.
7895683 7897947 - Unless what?<br />- Unless you do it first.
7898019 7900453 Spoken like a true prodigy.
7900521 7904057 How about you, Lash LaRue?<br />Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?
7904125 7908421 Mr. Wolf, look. The gun went off.<br />I don't know why. I'm cool. I promise you.
7908496 7911131 Fair enough. Now, I drive real<br />fuckin' fast, so keep up.
7911199 7913690 If get my car back<br />any different than I gave it,
7913768 7916703 Monster Joe's gonna be<br />disposing off two bodies.
7920541 7922236 Outta my way, Rex.
7923811 7926245 - We cool?<br />- Like it never happened.
7926314 7930080 - All right.<br />- Boys, this is Raquel.
7930151 7932779 Someday all this will be hers.
7932854 7935721 Hi. So, what's<br />with the outfits?
7935790 7939226 You guys going to a<br />volleyball game or something?
7939293 7941727 I'm takin' milady<br />out for breakfast.
7941796 7944560 Maybe I could drop you two off.<br />Where do you live?
7944632 7945997 - Redondo.<br />- Inglewood.
7946067 7949503 It's...<br />It's your future. I...
7949570 7952334 I see a...<br />A cab ride.
7952406 7955375 Move outta the sticks, fellas.<br />Say good night, Raquel.
7955443 7958378 - Good night, Raquel.<br />- I'll see you guys around.
7958446 7960880 Stay outta trouble,<br />you crazy kids.
7960948 7964884 Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was<br />a real pleasure watching you work.
7964952 7967887 Yeah, really.<br />And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.
7967955 7969889 Call me Winston.
7971459 7974394 You see that, young lady? Respect.
7974462 7978660 - Respect for one's elders shows character.<br />- I have character.
7978733 7982760 Because you are a character doesn't<br />mean that you have character.
7989343 7992278 Wanna share a cab?
7992346 7996612 I'd go for some breakfast.<br />Feel like havin' breakfast with me?
7996684 7999482 Cool.
8003524 8006618 I don't know why, I just thought<br />he'd be European or something.
8006694 8010130 - Yeah, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob.<br />- I know that now.
8010198 8012632 - But was he cool or what?<br />- Thank you.
8012700 8015134 Totally fuckin' cool,<br />in control.
8015203 8019264 Didn't even, you know, really get pissed when you<br />were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.
8021340 8021934 Want some bacon?
8022009 8023943 No, man, I don't eat pork.
8024011 8028047 - Are you Jewish?<br />- No, I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all.
8028115 8030450 - Why not?<br />- Pigs are filthy animals.
8030518 8032452 I don't eat filthy animals.
8032520 8035956 Yeah, but bacon tastes good.<br />Pork chops taste good.
8036023 8038958 Hey, sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,<br />but I'd never know...
8039026 8041961 'cause I wouldn't eat<br />the filthy motherfuckers.
8042029 8044964 Pigs sleep and root in shit.<br />That's a filthy animal.
8045032 8048968 I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got<br />sense enough to disregard its own feces.
8049036 8053370 - What about a dog? Dog eats its own feces.<br />- I don't eat dog either.
8053441 8056774 Yeah, but do you consider<br />a dog to be a filthy animal?
8056844 8059779 I wouldn't go so far<br />as to call a dog filthy,
8059847 8061781 but they're definitely dirty.
8061849 8065979 - But a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way.<br />- Ah, so, by that rationale,
8066053 8069614 if a pig had a better personality,<br />he would cease to be a filthy animal.
8069690 8073626 - Is that true?<br />- Well, we'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig.
8073694 8077721 I mean, he'd have to be ten times more<br />charming than that Arnold on Green Acres, you know I'm sayin'?
8083337 8085464 Oh, man, that's good.
8085539 8089134 That's good, man.<br />You're startin' to lighten up.
8089210 8092202 You've been sittin' there,<br />all serious and shit.
8092280 8094714 - I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.<br />- About what?
8094782 8097717 - About the miracle we witnessed.<br />- Miracle you witnessed.
8097785 8101050 - I witnessed a freak occurrence.<br />- What is a miracle, Vincent?
8102957 8106154 - Act of God.<br />- And what's an act of God?
8109630 8113464 When, um, God makes<br />the impossible possible.
8114502 8116436 But this morning...
8116504 8119234 - I don't think qualifies.<br />- Hey, Vincent.
8119307 8123004 Dont you see, that shit don't matter.<br />You're judging this shit the wrong way.
8123077 8128614 I mean it could be God stopped the bullets,<br />or he changed Coke to Pepsi, found my fuckin' car keys.
8128682 8131074 You don't judge shit like this<br />based on merit.
8131152 8133586 Now, whether or not<br />what we experienced...
8133654 8136817 was an according-to-Hoyle miracle<br />is insignificant.
8136891 8140657 But what is significant,<br />is I felt the touch of God.
8140728 8142662 God got involved.
8142730 8144459 But why?
8144532 8147558 Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:<br />I don't know why.
8147635 8150604 - But I can't go back to sleep.<br />- You're serious.
8150671 8152605 You're really thinkin'<br />about quittin'.
8152673 8155335 - For life? Most definitely.<br />- Yeah.
8155409 8158776 Fuck.<br />What you gonna do then?
8160081 8164313 Well, that's what I been<br />sitting here contemplating.
8164385 8167980 First I'm gonna deliver<br />this case to Marsellus.
8168055 8171149 Then, basically, I'm just<br />gonna walk the Earth.
8171225 8174661 - What you mean, "walk the Earth"?<br />- Like Caine in Kung Fu.
8174729 8177698 Walk from place to place,<br />meet people, get in adventures.
8177765 8180029 And how long do you intend<br />to walk the Earth?
8180101 8183400 - 'Til God puts me where He wants me to be.<br />- What if He don't do that?
8183471 8188408 - If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever.<br />- So you decided to be a bum.
8188476 8192139 I'll just be Jules, Vincent.<br />No more, no less.
8192213 8194181 No, Jules,<br />you decided to be a bum,
8194248 8197547 just like all those pieces of shit<br />out there who beg for change,
8197618 8200553 who sleep in garbage bins,<br />eat what I throw away.
8200621 8203590 They got a name for that, Jules.<br />It's called a bum.
8203657 8207320 And without a job, a residence or legal tender,<br />that's what you're gonna be, man.
8207395 8209329 You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.
8209397 8212332 Look, my friend,<br />this is just where you and I differ.
8212400 8215233 Garçon! Coffee!
8215302 8219796 Jules, look, what happened this morning,<br />man, I agree it was peculiar.
8219874 8223002 - But water into wine, l...<br />- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.
8223077 8226171 - Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.<br />- If my answers frighten you, Vincent...
8226247 8228841 then you should cease<br />asking scary questions.
8231719 8233653 I'm gonna take a shit.
8238424 8240073 Let me ask you something.
8240107 8242534 When did you make this decision?<br />When you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?
8242609 8246545 Yeah. I was sittin' here<br />eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,
8246613 8248547 replayin' the incident<br />in my head,
8248615 8252415 when I had what alcoholics refer to<br />as a moment of clarity.
8252485 8255613 Fuck. To be continued.
8267634 8270569 - I love you, Pumpkin.<br />- I love you, Honey Bunny.
8272172 8275107 Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!
8275175 8280169 Any one of you fucking pricks move,<br />and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers!
8280246 8283647 - You got that? You just be quiet over there!<br />- Waitresses on the floor!
8283717 8286777 Get on the fuckin'...<br />Get the fuck down!
8286853 8291886 You, you're in a blind spot.<br />Take your dames over to that booth over there, on the count of ten!
8291918 8296220 - Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!<br />- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...
8296296 8299390 What the fuck are you doing,<br />you fucking yuppie? Get down!
8299466 8301934 - Get down!<br />- Throw those bags!

8304571 8306835 Move! Get the fuck...
8306906 8309932 Get down on the fucking floor!
8310010 8311944 Grandpa! Down!
8312012 8315379 I'm the manager here, and there's<br />no problem. No problem at all.
8315448 8318383 - You gonna give me a problem?<br />- No, sir, I'm not.
8318451 8322478 Thought you said you were gonna<br />give me a fucking problem!
8322555 8327254 - I think we got a hero here, Honey Bunny.<br />- Well, just execute him!
8327327 8329861 I am not a hero.
8329929 8332355 - I'm just a coffee shop manager.<br />- Get the fuck down!
8332432 8334195 The restaurant's ours!
8334267 8337202 Just take whatever you want.
8337270 8339204 - You talk to the customers.<br />- Yeah.
8339272 8342400 You tell them to be fucking cool<br />and everything will be over.
8342475 8344443 - You understand me?<br />- Yes!
8346746 8348543 Listen, everybody.
8348615 8351140 Be calm, cooperate,
8351157 8353652 and this'll all be over<br />in a minute!
8353720 8355688 Get the fuck down!<br />Well done.
8368034 8371470 All right, now, people,<br />gonna come around and collect your wallets!
8371538 8374996 You don't fucking talk.<br />You just throw 'em in the bag! Are we clear?
8375075 8377305 I said, are we fucking clear?
8377377 8380312 Good!<br />Now, wallets out!
8380380 8383975 That's it.<br />Get the fuck down. In the bag.
8384050 8386985 - In the fucking bag!<br />- I don't have nothin' on me, man.
8387053 8388918 In the bag.
8388988 8391923 What am I waiting for?<br />In the fucking bag.
8391991 8394926 Laura. Laura. Tips.<br />In the bag.
8394994 8397224 - Is that a cellular phone?<br />- Yeah.
8397297 8399231 In the fucking bag.
8400800 8404258 Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.<br />Now get the fuck down on the floor.
8404337 8406771 In the bag.<br />In the bag.
8418952 8420886 In the bag.
8436002 8438937 - What's in the case?<br />- My boss's dirty laundry.
8439005 8441530 - Your boss makes you do his laundry?<br />- When he wants it clean.
8441608 8444304 - Sounds like a shit job.<br />- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.
8444377 8447312 - Open it.<br />- 'Fraid I can't do that.
8449349 8451715 - I didn't hear you.<br />- Yes, you did.
8452785 8455117 What's going on?
8455188 8458646 - Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.<br />- Shoot him in the face!
8458725 8462456 I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't<br />the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.
8462529 8465930 - If you don't take your hand off that case, it'll be your last.<br />- Stop causing problems!
8465999 8468797 You'll get us all killed!<br />Give 'em what you got and get 'em outta here!
8468868 8473100 Shut the fuck up, fat man!<br />This ain't none of your goddamn business!
8473173 8475403 Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.
8475475 8477568 No problem.<br />I got it under control.
8479145 8481136 Now, I'm gonna count to three.
8482749 8486685 If you don't open that case,<br />I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.
8491090 8493024 We clear?
8496162 8498096 One.
8499933 8502458 Two.
8502535 8504594 - Three.<br />- Okay, Ringo.
8504671 8506730 You win.
8506806 8508740 It's yours.
8512779 8515509 Open it.
8519385 8521615 Hey, what is it?
8521688 8524020 What is it?
8524090 8526684 Is that what I think it is?
8526759 8529455 Mm-hmm.
8531030 8533157 It's beautiful.
8533233 8535793 Goddamn it, what is it?
8538270 8540505 You let him go!<br />You let him go!
8540573 8543242 - Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!<br />- Tell that bitch to be cool.
8543309 8546244 - Say, "Bitch, be cool!" Say, "Bitch, be cool!"<br />- Be cool, Honey Bunny! Be cool!
8546312 8549042 - Tell that fuckin' bitch to chill!<br />- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!
8549115 8552016 - Chill that fuckin' bitch out!<br />- Chill out, Honey Bunny!
8552085 8553882 - Let go of him!<br />- Just chill out, Honey Bunny!
8553953 8557188 - Alright, now tell it's gonna be all right! Promise her!<br />- It's gonna be alright. I promise!
8557256 8559256 - Tell her to chill!<br />- Just chill out, Honey Bunny!
8559325 8561259 - Alright, now tell me her name.<br />- Yolanda.
8561327 8564663 Alright, now Yolanda,<br />we're not gonna do anything stupid, are we?
8564730 8567365 - Don't you hurt him!<br />- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!
8567433 8570925 We're all gonna be like three little Fonzies here.<br />And what's Fonzie like?
8573004 8574667 - Come on, Yolanda! What's Fonzie like?<br />- He's cool.
8574741 8576675 - What?<br />- Cool.
8576743 8579976 Correctamundo.<br />And that's what we're gonna be.
8580246 8581580 We're gonna be cool.
8581648 8586551 Now, Ringo,<br />I'm gonna count to three.
8586619 8588712 And when I count three,
8588788 8591723 I want you to<br />let go of your gun,
8591791 8595249 put your palms flat on the table<br />and sit your ass down.
8596329 8598388 And when you do it,
8598464 8600523 you do it cool.
8600600 8602932 You ready?
8603002 8605095 One,
8605171 8607366 two,
8607440 8609374 three.
8618049 8619477 - Okay, now you let him go!<br />- Yolanda!
8619552 8623447 I thought you were gonna be cool.<br />Now, when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.
8623522 8625915 And when I get nervous,<br />I get scared.
8625991 8629925 And when motherfuckers get scared,<br />that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.
8630863 8634492 Just know, you hurt him, you die.
8634567 8637968 Well, that seems to be<br />the situation.
8638037 8639971 But I don't want that.
8640039 8641973 And you don't want that.
8642041 8645271 And Ringo here definitely<br />doesn't want that.
8645344 8646937 So let's see what we can do.
8649349 8652580 Now... here's the situation.
8652652 8656520 Normally both your asses would be<br />dead as fuckin' fried chicken,
8656589 8660025 but you happened to pull this shit<br />while I'm in a transitional period,
8660093 8663028 and I don't wanna kill you;<br />I wanna help you.
8663096 8667032 But I can't give you this case,<br />'cause it don't belong to me.
8667100 8670035 Besides, I been through too much shit<br />over this case this morning...
8670103 8673038 to just hand it over<br />to your dumb ass.
8673106 8674971 Vincent!
8675041 8678776 - Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.<br />- Get back!
8678844 8680940 It's cool!<br />We still just talkin'.
8680993 8684977 Come on. Point the gun at me.<br />Point the gun at me. There you go.
8685051 8688510 Now, Vincent, you just hang back...
8688516 8689520 and don't do a goddamn thing.
8689588 8691122 Tell her it's still cool.
8691190 8694425 - It's still cool, Honey Bunny.<br />- How we doin', baby?
8695528 8698190 I... I gotta go pee.
8698264 8700198 I wanna go home.
8700266 8703861 Just hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.<br />And Ringo's proud of you.
8703936 8706871 It's almost over.<br />Tell her you're proud of her.
8706939 8710306 - I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.<br />- I love you.
8710376 8713539 - I love you too, Honey Bunny.<br />- Now,
8713613 8717549 I want you to go in that bag<br />and find my wallet.
8720086 8724022 - Which one is it?<br />- It's the one that says "Bad Motherfucker."
8738283 8741843 That's it.<br />That's my bad motherfucker.
8741919 8744013 Open it up.<br />Take out the money.
8749060 8751221 Count it.
8757535 8760060 How much is there?
8762973 8763907 About 1,500 dollars.
8763975 8767172 Okay, put it in your pocket.<br />It's yours.
8767245 8770442 Now, with the rest<br />of those wallets and the register,
8770515 8772608 that makes this a pretty successful<br />little score, huh?
8772684 8776586 Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars,<br />and I'll shoot him on general principle.
8776655 8780091 No, Yolanda! Yolanda!<br />He ain't gonna do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!
8780158 8782251 Vince, shut the fuck up!
8782327 8786195 - Shut up!<br />- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.
8786264 8789199 Now, I ain't givin' it<br />to him, Vincent.
8789267 8791201 I'm buyin' something<br />for my money.
8792437 8795634 - Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?<br />- What?
8795707 8800440 Your life. I'm givin' you that money<br />so I don't have to kill your ass.
8800512 8803208 You read the Bible, Ringo?
8804282 8806216 Not regularly, no.
8806284 8808718 Well, there's this passage<br />I got memorized.
8808787 8812314 Ezekiel 25:17.
8812390 8815823 "The path of the righteous man<br />is beset on all sides..."
8815893 8817827 by the inequities<br />of the selfish...
8817895 8819229 and the tyranny of evil men.
8819897 8822964 Blessed is he who,<br />in the name of charity and good will,
8822994 8825168 shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness,
8825236 8829332 for he is truly his brother's keeper<br />and the finder of lost children.
8829407 8834107 And I will strike down upon thee with<br />great vengeance and furious anger...
8834118 8836838 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy My brothers.
8837415 8839941 And you will know<br />I am the Lord...
8840018 8843579 "when I lay My vengeance<br />upon you."
8844656 8847090 I been sayin' that shit for years,
8847158 8850321 and if you heard it,<br />that meant your ass.
8850395 8853730 I never gave much thought<br />to what it meant.
8853798 8856333 I just thought it was some coldblooded<br />shit to say to a motherfucker...
8856401 8858835 before I popped a cap<br />in his ass.
8858903 8862339 But I saw some shit this morning<br />made me think twice.
8862407 8865342 See, now I'm thinkin'<br />maybe it means...
8865410 8870279 you're the evil man,<br />and I'm the righteous man,
8870348 8873283 and Mr. 9-millimeter here,<br />he's the shepherd...
8873351 8876912 protecting my righteous ass<br />in the valley of darkness.
8876988 8878922 Or it could mean...
8878990 8882426 you're the righteous man,<br />and I'm the shepherd,
8882494 8886430 and it's the world<br />that's evil and selfish.
8886498 8888762 Now, I'd like that.
8888833 8891734 But that shit ain't the truth.
8891803 8893668 The truth is,
8894739 8896673 you're the weak...
8898076 8901477 and I'm the tyranny of evil men.
8902881 8904815 But I'm tryin', Ringo.
8906084 8909019 I'm tryin' real hard...
8909087 8911351 to be the shepherd.
8926671 8928605 Go.
8946991 8948725 I think we should be<br />leaving now.
8949193 8951728 Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
