30072 34201 Forget it. It's too risky.<br />I'm through doing that shit.
34284 36745 You always say that.<br />The same thing every time.
36828 39748 "I'm through, never again,<br />too dangerous."
39831 42292 I know that's what I always say.<br />I'm always right too.
42417 45796 You forget about it in a day or two.<br />The days of me<br />forgetting are over.
45879 47965 The days of me remembering<br />have just begun.
48048 50133 You know, when you go on like this,<br />what you sound like?
50259 53262 I sound like a sensible<br />fuckin' man.<br />You sound like a duck.
53387 56848 Quack, quack, quack.<br />Take heart, 'cause you're never<br />gonna have to hear it again.
56932 60352 Since I'm never gonna do it again,<br />you're never gonna have to<br />hear me quack.
60477 65148 After tonight?<br />Correct.<br />I got all tonight to quack.
65274 68110 Can I get anyone more coffee?<br />Oh, yes!
69945 72489 Thank you.<br />You're welcome.
72573 75659 I mean,<br />the way it is now,
75742 78537 you're takin' the same risk<br />as when you rob a bank.
78620 80664 Takin' more of a risk.<br />Banks are easier.
80747 83750 Federal banks ain't supposed<br />to stop you in any way<br />during a robbery.
83834 88046 They're insured. Why should<br />they give a fuck? I don't even<br />need a gun in a federal bank.
88130 91592 Heard about this one bloke,<br />he walks into a bank<br />with a portable phone.
91675 94636 He gives the phone to a teller.<br />The bloke on the other end says,
94720 98265 "We got this guy's little girl.<br />If you don't give him all your<br />money, we're gonna kill her."
98348 101143 - Did it work?<br />- Fuckin' right it worked.<br />That's what I'm talkin' about.
101226 107024 Knucklehead walks into a bank<br />with a telephone, not a pistol,<br />not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.
107149 111737 Cleans the place out.<br />They don't lift a fuckin' finger.<br />Did they hurt the little girl?
111820 115532 There probably never was a little girl.<br />The point of the story isn't a little girl.
115616 118577 The point of the story is they<br />robbed a bank with a telephone.
118660 121622 - You want to rob banks?<br />- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.
121705 124124 I'm illustrating if we did,<br />it'd be easier than what<br />we've been doing.
124207 128337 - No more liquor stores?<br />- What've we been talkin' about?<br />Yeah, no more liquor stores.
128462 131423 Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.<br />There's too many foreigners<br />own liquor stores.
131506 133425 Vietnamese, Koreans,<br />don't even speak fuckin' English.
133508 135844 You tell 'em empty out<br />the register, they don't know<br />what you're talkin' about.
135927 137804 They make it too personal.
137929 142142 We keep on, one of these gook<br />fuckers gonna make us kill him.<br />I'm not gonna kill anybody.
142225 146521 I don't want to either.<br />But they'll probably put us in<br />a situation where it's us or them.
146605 148523 And if it's not the gooks,
148607 151234 it's these old fuckin' Jews<br />who've owned the store<br />for 15 fucking generations.
151318 155739 You got Grandpa Irving sitting<br />behind the counter with<br />a fucking Magnum in his hand.
155822 157741 Try walkin' into one of those places<br />with nothing but a phone.
157824 159701 See how far that gets you.<br />Forget it.
159826 162704 We're out of it.<br />Well, what then, day jobs?
162829 164873 Not in this life.<br />What then?
167042 169211 <i>Garcon,</i> coffee!
169294 171588 This place.
173048 176176 <i>Garcon</i><br />means boy.
179388 182057 This place?<br />A coffee shop?
182140 185102 What's wrong with that?
185185 188855 Nobody ever robs restaurants.<br />Why not?
189815 192234 Bars, liquor stores,
192317 196029 gas stations;<br />you get your head blown off<br />stickin' up one of them.
196113 199783 Restaurants, on the other hand,<br />you catch with their pants down.
199866 203495 They're not expectin' to get robbed.<br />Not as expectin' anyway.
203620 208125 I bet you could cut down<br />on the hero factor in a place like this.<br />Correct.
208208 211461 Same as banks,<br />these places are insured.
211545 213880 Manager.<br />He don't give a fuck.
213964 216800 They're just trying to get you out<br />before you start pluggin' the diners.
216883 220846 Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it.<br />No way they're takin' a bullet<br />for the register.
220929 223849 Busboys. Some wetback gettin'<br />paid $ 1.50 an hour...
223932 226435 really give a fuck you're<br />stealin' from the owner?
226518 229563 Customers sittin' there<br />with food in their mouths,<br />they don't know what's goin' on.
229688 234359 One minute,<br />they're havin' a Denver omelet, the next,<br />someone is stickin' a gun in their face.
234443 239489 See, I got the idea<br />the last liquor store<br />we stuck up, remember?
239573 242242 - All the customers kept comin' in.<br />- Yeah.
242325 246163 You got the idea<br />of takin' their wallets.<br />Now, that was a good idea.
246246 249583 - Thank you.<br />- Made more from the wallets<br />than we did from the register.
249708 252002 Yes, we did.<br />A lot of people<br />come to restaurants.
252085 255714 - A lot of wallets.<br />- Pretty smart, huh?
255797 257841 Pretty smart.
259384 262345 I'm ready. Let's do it.<br />Right now, right here.
262471 266975 Come on.<br />All right. Same as<br />last time, remember?
267058 269811 You're crowd control.<br />I'll handle the employees.
275484 278236 I love you, pumpkin.<br />I love you, honey bunny.
279446 281907 Everybody be cool!<br />This is a robbery!
281990 284868 Any of you fucking pricks move,
284951 288747 and I'll execute every motherfuckin'<br />last one of you.

426259 430305 Okay, so tell me again<br />about the hash bars.<br />Okay, what you want to know?
430430 433224 Hash is legal there, right?<br />Yeah, it's legal,<br />but it ain't 100% legal.
433308 437938 You just can't walk into a restaurant,<br />roll a joint and start puffin' away.
438021 441316 I mean, they want you<br />to smoke in your home<br />or certain designated places.
441441 444069 Those are hash bars?<br />Yeah.<br />It breaks down like this.
444152 446488 It's legal to buy it.<br />It's legal to own it.
446571 449741 And if you're the proprietor<br />of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
449824 454245 It's illegal to carry it,<br />but-but that doesn't matter,<br />'cause get a load of this.
454329 458708 If you get stopped by a cop<br />in Amsterdam, it's illegal<br />for them to search you.
458833 462754 I mean, that's a right the cops<br />in Amsterdam <i>don't</i> have.<br />Oh, man! I'm goin'.
462837 465382 That's all there is to it.<br />I'm fuckin' goin'.
465465 468343 I know, baby.<br />You'd dig it the most.
468468 471179 But you know what the funniest<br />thing about Europe is?<br />What?
471262 475183 It's the little differences.<br />I mean, they got the same shit<br />over there that they got here,
475266 478812 - but it's just there,<br />it's a little different.<br />- Example.
478895 482023 You can walk into a movie theater<br />in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
482107 485735 And I don't mean just like no paper cup.<br />I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.
485819 489614 And in Paris, you can buy<br />a beer in McDonald's.<br />You know what they call...
489698 493201 a Quarter Pounder<br />with Cheese in Paris?
493284 495453 They don't call it<br />a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?
495537 498331 They got the metric system.<br />They wouldn't know what the fuck<br />a quarter-pounder is.
498415 502252 - What do they call it?<br />- They call it a <i>Royale</i> with Cheese.
502377 503837 <i>Royale</i> with Cheese.<br />That's right.
503920 505839 What do they call a Big Mac?
505922 509217 Big Mac's a Big Mac,<br />but they call it <i>Le</i> Big Mac.
509300 512387 [Imitating French Accent]<br /><i>Le</i> Big Mac. [Laughs]
512512 516599 What do they call a Whopper?<br />I don't know. I didn't<br />go into Burger King.
516725 520103 You know what they put on french fries<br />in Holland instead of ketchup?<br />What?
520228 523189 Mayonnaise.<br />[Chuckles]<br />Goddamn!
523314 527610 I seen 'em do it, man.<br />They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.<br />Yuck.
530280 533575 We should have shotguns<br />for this kind of deal.
536578 539289 How many up there?<br />Three or four.
539414 542959 That's countin' our guy?<br />Not sure.
543084 546463 So that means that it could be<br />up to five guys up there?<br />It's possible.
546546 548882 We should have fuckin' shotguns.
549007 551593 What's her name?<br />Mia.
551718 555889 Mia. How did Marsellus<br />and her meet?<br />I don't know.
555972 559559 However people meet people.<br />She used to be a actress.
559642 562103 Oh, really?<br />She do anything<br />I'd have seen?
562228 566608 I think her biggest deal<br />was she starred in a pilot.<br />Pilot? What's a pilot?
566733 570236 Well, you know<br />the shows on TV?<br />I don't watch TV.
570320 573907 Yeah, but you are aware<br />that there is an invention<br />called television,
574032 577118 and on this invention<br />they show shows, right?<br />Yeah.
577202 581581 The way they pick TV shows<br />is they make one show.<br />That show's called a pilot.
581664 584584 Then they show that one show<br />to the people who pick shows...
584667 587587 and on the strength of that<br />one show, they decide if<br />they wanna make more shows.
587670 592217 Some get chosen and<br />become television programs.<br />Some don't, become nothin'.
592300 595470 She starred in one of the ones<br />that became nothing.
595553 598306 You remember<br />Antwan Rockamora?
598389 602185 Half-black, half-Samoan.<br />Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror."
602310 605688 Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?<br />I wouldn't go so far as to<br />call the brother fat.
605772 608525 He got a weight problem.<br />I mean, what's a nigger<br />gonna do? He's Samoan.
608650 613071 I think I know who you mean.<br />What about him?<br />Marsellus fucked him up good.
613154 617408 Word 'round the campfire<br />is it was on account of<br />Marsellus Wallace's wife.
617492 620453 [Elevator Bell Rings]
625542 629546 So what he'd do? Fuck her?<br />No, no, no, no, no.<br />Nothin' that bad.
629671 633341 Well, then what then?<br />He gave her a foot massage.
635593 637804 A foot massage?
637929 639973 That's it?<br />Mm-hmm.
640056 641975 Then what'd Marsellus do?
642058 645228 Sent a couple cats over to his place.<br />They took him out on his patio.
645311 649232 Threw his ass over the balcony.<br />Nigger fell four stories.
649315 653361 He had a little garden down<br />at the bottom enclosed in glass,<br />like a greenhouse.
653444 655697 Nigger fell <i>through</i> that.
655780 658700 Since then, he kind of developed<br />a speech impediment.
660201 662912 That's a damn shame.<br />Hmm.
667625 671421 But still, you play with<br />matches, you get burned.<br />What do you mean?
671504 675633 You don't be givin'<br />Marsellus Wallace's new bride<br />a foot massage.
675717 678178 You don't think he overreacted?
678261 683141 Antwan didn't expect Marsellus<br />to react the way he did, but<br />he had to expect a reaction.
683224 687353 It was a foot massage.<br />A foot massage is nothin'.<br />I give my mother a foot massage.
687437 690982 It's laying your hands<br />in a familiar way<br />on Marsellus's new wife.
691065 695945 I mean, is it as bad as eatin'<br />her pussy out? No, but it's<br />the same fuckin' ballpark.
696029 698114 Whoa, stop right there.<br />Eatin' the bitch out...
698198 700742 and givin' the bitch<br />a foot massage ain't even<br />the same fucking thing.
700867 704787 It's not.<br />It's the same ballpark.<br />Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.
704871 707790 Now, look, maybe your method<br />of massage differs from mine.
707874 711628 But touchin' his wife's feet<br />and sticking your tongue<br />in the holiest of holies...
711711 715924 ain't the same fuckin' ballpark;<br />it ain't the same league;<br />it ain't the same fuckin' sport.
716049 719886 Foot massages don't mean shit!<br />Have you ever given<br />a foot massage?
719969 723014 [Scoffs]<br />Don't be tellin' me<br />about foot massages.
723139 725808 I'm the foot fuckin' master.<br />You given a lot of them?
725892 730104 Shit, yeah! Got my technique<br />down and everything.<br />I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.
730188 732857 Would you give a guy<br />a foot massage?
734275 736903 Fuck you.<br />[Chuckles]
737028 740073 You give 'em a lot?<br />Fuck you.
740198 743451 You know, I'm kind of tired.<br />I could use a foot massage.<br />Yo, yo, yo, man.
743534 746746 You best back off.<br />I'm gettin' a little pissed here.
747789 750375 This is the door.<br />Yeah, it is.
753127 755755 What time you got?
755838 757966 7:22 in the a.m.
758049 761636 No, it ain't quite time yet.<br />Come on. Let's hang back.
769185 772939 Now, look, just 'cause<br />I wouldn't give no man a foot<br />massage don't make it right...
773022 776234 for Marsellus to throw<br />Antwan off a building into<br />a glass motherfuckin' house,
776317 779028 fuckin' up the way<br />the nigger talks;<br />that shit ain't right.
779112 783324 Motherfucker do that shit to me,<br />he better paralyze my ass,<br />'cause I kill the motherfucker.
783408 788371 I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin'<br />a foot massage don't mean nothin'.<br />I'm sayin' it does.
788454 793084 Now, look, I've given a million<br />ladies a million foot massages,<br />and they all meant somethin'.
793167 796879 We act like they don't, but they do.<br />That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.
796963 799048 There's a sensuous thing goin' on...
799132 802343 where you don't talk about it,<br />but you know it and she knows it.
802427 807473 Fuckin' Marsellus knew it.<br />And Antwan should've fuckin'<br />better known better.
807557 811936 That's his fuckin' wife, man.<br />This ain't a man with a sense<br />of humor about this shit.
812020 814814 You know what I'm sayin'?
814897 816816 It's an interestin' point.
816899 818860 Come on.<br />Let's get into character.
825783 827744 What's her name again?<br />Mia.
827869 830872 Mia.<br />Why you so interested<br />in big man's wife?
830955 836127 He's goin' out of town, Florida.<br />And he asked me if I'd take care<br />of her while he's gone.
836252 840214 Take care of her?<br />No, man.<br />Just take her out.
840298 843634 Show her a good time.<br />Make sure she don't get lonely.
843718 846262 You're gonna be takin'<br />Mia Wallace out on a date?
846346 848973 It is not a date.
849057 853102 It's just like if you were<br />gonna take your buddy's wife<br />to a movie or somethin'.
853227 856731 It's just good company,<br />that's all.<br />[Sighs]
860735 865239 It's not a date.<br />It's definitely not a date.<br />[Sighs]
871913 875750 Hey, kids.<br />How you boys doin'?
875833 878503 Hey, keep chillin'.
884675 887470 You know who we are?
887553 891516 We're associates<br />of your business partner,<br />Marsellus Wallace.
891599 894602 You do remember<br />your business partner, don't you?
897313 900274 Now, let me take<br />a wild guess here.
902276 905321 - You're Brett, right?<br />- Yeah.
905405 909659 I thought so.<br />You remember your business<br />partner Marsellus Wallace,
909784 913371 don't ya, Brett?<br />Yeah, I remember.
913454 917750 Good. Looks like me and Vincent<br />caught you boys at breakfast.
917834 920461 Sorry about that.<br />Whatcha havin'?
920545 922505 Hamburgers.
922588 926676 Hamburgers!<br />The cornerstone of<br />any nutritious breakfast.
928052 930304 What kind of hamburgers?
930430 932140 Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.<br />No, no, no.
932223 935268 Where'd you get 'em?<br />McDonald's, Wendy's,<br />Jack in the Box?
935393 938187 Where?<br />Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.
938271 941399 Big Kahuna Burger!<br />That's that Hawaiian<br />burger joint.
941482 945403 I hear they got some tasty burgers.<br />I ain't never had one myself.<br />How are they?
945486 948156 They're... They're good.
948239 950867 You mind if I try one of yours?
950950 953369 This is yours here, right?<br />Yeah.
961627 963463 Mmmm.
963546 966674 This <i>is</i> a tasty burger!<br />Vincent!
966757 969302 You ever had<br />a Big Kahuna burger?
970303 972763 Want a bite?<br />They're real tasty.
972889 976309 I ain't hungry.<br />Well, if you like burgers,<br />give 'em a try sometime.
976392 980229 Me, I can't usually get 'em<br />'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,
980313 983441 which pretty much makes me<br />a vegetarian.
983524 986652 But I do love the taste<br />of a good burger. Mmmm.
986736 991240 You know what they call<br />a Quarter Pounder with Cheese<br />in France?
991365 993367 No.<br />Tell 'em, Vincent.
993493 997497 <i>A Royale</i><br />with Cheese.<br />A <i>Royale</i> with Cheese.
997580 1001042 You know why<br />they call it that?
1001125 1004212 Uh, because of<br />the metric system?
1005254 1008549 Check out the big brain<br />on Brett!
1008633 1012011 You're a smart motherfucker.<br />That's right. The metric system.
1014305 1016432 What's in this?<br />Sprite.

3591755 3594674 But she's got a breastplate...<br />you gotta pierce through that.<br />[Thumping]
3594758 3597677 You gotta bring the needle<br />down in a stabbing motion.

3700947 3702908 What's yours?
3705952 3709831 Well, I'm of the opinion<br />that if Marsellus lived<br />his whole life,

3713919 3716838 If Marsellus knew<br />about this incident,

3846384 3850138 Well, this here is Captain Koons.
3850221 3853141 He was in the P.O.W. camp<br />with Daddy.
3858480 3860398 Hello, little man.
3860482 3864569 Boy, I sure heard<br />a bunch about you.
3864652 3867864 See, I was a good friend<br />of your dad's.
3867947 3870992 We were in that Hanoi<br />pit of hell together...
3871076 3873495 over five years.
3873578 3875497 Hopefully...
3875580 3878500 you'll never have to<br />experience this yourself,
3878583 3882003 but when two men<br />are in a situation like me<br />and your dad were...
3882087 3884881 for as long as we were,
3884964 3889260 you take on certain<br />responsibilities of the other.
3889344 3891262 If it'd been me who'd...
3892597 3894516 not made it,
3894599 3898895 Major Coolidge'd be talking<br />right now to my son Jim.
3898978 3902607 But the way it turned out,<br />I'm talking to you.
3904025 3905944 Butch...
3907529 3909447 I got something for ya.
3915954 3918039 This watch I got here...
3918123 3922877 was first purchased<br />by your great-grandfather<br />during the First World War.
3922961 3927632 It was bought<br />in a little general store<br />in Knoxville, Tennessee.
3927715 3931261 Made by the first company<br />to ever make wristwatches.
3931344 3934264 Up 'til then, people just<br />carried pocket watches.
3934347 3937517 It was bought by<br />Private Doughboy<br />Erine Coolidge...
3937600 3940520 on the day he set sail<br />for Paris.
3940603 3943022 This was your<br />great-grandfather's war watch,
3943106 3946443 and he wore it every day<br />he was in that war, and...
3946526 3950071 when he'd done his duty,<br />he went home to your<br />great-grandmother,
3950155 3954576 took the watch off,<br />put it in an old coffee can,<br />and in that can it stayed...
3954659 3959080 until your granddad,<br />Dane Coolidge, was called<br />upon by his country...
3959164 3962876 to go overseas and fight<br />the Germans once again.
3962959 3966421 This time they called it<br />World War II.
3966504 3971468 Your great-grandfather<br />gave this watch to your<br />granddad for good luck.
3971551 3974554 Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't<br />as good as his old man's.
3974637 3977557 Dane was a Marine,<br />and he was killed,
3977640 3981644 along with all<br />the other Marines at<br />the battle of Wake Island.
3981728 3984647 Your granddad<br />was facing death.
3984731 3986649 He knew it.
3986733 3990653 None of those boys had<br />any illusions about ever<br />leaving that island alive,
3990737 3993948 so three days before<br />the Japanese took the island,
3994032 3999245 your granddad asked a gunner<br />on an Air Force transport,<br />name of Winocki...
3999329 4002248 a man he'd never met before<br />in his life...
4002332 4005293 to deliver to his infant son,
4005376 4009964 who he'd never seen in the flesh,<br />his gold watch.
4010048 4014385 Three days later,<br />your granddad was dead,<br />but Winocki kept his word.
4014469 4018681 After the war was over,<br />he paid a visit to your grandmother,
4018765 4023019 delivering to your infant father<br />his dad's gold watch.
4023102 4025021 This watch.
4030902 4036324 This watch was on your<br />daddy's wrist when he was<br />shot down over Hanoi.
4036407 4039827 He was captured, put in<br />a Vietnamese prison camp.
4039911 4043957 He knew if the gooks<br />ever saw the watch,
4044040 4047544 it'd be confiscated,<br />taken away.
4047627 4051339 The way your dad looked at it,<br />this watch was your birthright.
4051422 4055343 He'd be damned if any slope's<br />gonna put their greasy, yellow<br />hands on his boy's birthright,
4055426 4059347 so he hid it in one place<br />he knew he could hide<br />something... his ass.
4059430 4062850 Five long years<br />he wore this watch up his ass.
4062934 4067105 Then he died of dysentery...<br />He give me the watch.
4067188 4071025 I hid this uncomfortable<br />hunk of metal up my ass<br />two years.
4071109 4073027 Then...
4073111 4077198 after seven years,<br />I was sent home to my family and...
4077282 4079200 now...
4081619 4084581 little man,<br />I give the watch to you.

4256919 4259380 Hey, mister.<br />What?
4259464 4264218 You were in that fight,<br />the fight on the radio.
4264343 4267805 You're the fighter?<br />Whatever gave you that idea?
4267889 4270600 No, come on.
4270683 4272643 You're him.

4278858 4280777 I'm him.
4281861 4284322 You killed<br />the other boxing man.
4287950 4290036 He's dead?
4290119 4292538 The radio<br />said he was dead.
4295333 4297543 Sorry about that, Floyd.

4313267 4315186 No.
4315269 4320191 It is a subject I have<br />much interest in.
4320274 4324195 You are the first person<br />I have ever met who has<br />killed somebody.
4326697 4329075 So?

4357228 4360481 So, Esmarelda...
4361816 4365194 Villa Lobos...<br />is that Mexican?
4365278 4368489 The name is Spanish,<br />but I am Colombian.
4368573 4371826 - That's some handle<br />you got there, honey.<br />- Thank you.
4371909 4373870 And what is your name?
4373953 4375621 Butch.
4375705 4378165 Butch.
4378249 4383004 - What does it mean?<br />- I'm an American, honey.<br />Our names don't mean shit.
4383087 4385715 So, moving right along,
4385798 4387717 Esmarelda,
4387800 4390052 what is it you want to know?
4390177 4395057 I want to know what it<br />feels like to kill a man.<br />I couldn't tell ya.
4400938 4405359 I didn't know he was dead<br />'til you told me he was dead.
4405443 4410031 Now that I know he's dead,<br />you wanna know how I feel about it?
4413784 4417204 I don't feel<br />the least bit bad about it.
4428215 4430593 What the fuck'd I tell ya?<br />Huh?
4430676 4434597 As soon as the word got out<br />the fix was in, man, the odds<br />went through the roof.
4434680 4436891 I know. I know.<br />Unbelievable.
4436974 4440394 Hey, fuck him, Scotty.<br />If he was a better boxer,<br />he'd still be alive.
4440478 4442396 If he never laced up his gloves,
4442480 4444899 which he never shoulda done<br />in the first fuckin' place,<br />he'd still be alive.
4444982 4446901 [Hawks, Spits]
4446984 4450571 Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?<br />It's over now.
4450655 4453574 Yeah, well,<br />enough about the poor,<br />unfortunate Mr. Floyd.
4453658 4457328 Let's talk about the rich<br />and prosperous Mr. Butch.
4457411 4460331 How many bookies did you<br />lay it around on?
4460414 4462833 All eight?<br />How long to collect?
4464502 4467421 So you'll have it all<br />by tomorrow night?<br />No, I understand.
4467505 4470633 A few stragglers aside.<br />Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.
4470716 4472927 That is great news, man.
4473010 4477223 Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me<br />and Fabienne are gonna<br />leave in the morning.
4477306 4480559 It'll probably take us<br />a couple days to get<br />down to Knoxville.
4480643 4482561 Okay, my brother.
4482645 4484605 [Laughing]<br />You're right.
4484689 4486983 You're goddamn right.
4487066 4490569 All right, Scotty,<br />next time I see you,<br />it'll be on Tennessee time.
4490653 4492905 Cool, brother.
4508170 4510589 $45.60.
4514176 4516095 And, uh,
4516178 4519432 here's a little something<br />for the effort. Now...
4519515 4523477 if anybody asks you who<br />your fare was tonight,<br />what are you gonna say?
4523561 4525479 The truth.
4525563 4529066 Three well-dressed,<br />slightly toasted Mexicans.
4530943 4533320 <i>Bonsoir,</i><br />Esmarelda Villa Lobos.
4533404 4535948 <i>Buenas noches,</i><br />Butch.
4547084 4548961 Whew.
4550379 4552339 Keep the light off.
4552423 4555342 Is that better, sugar pop?<br /><i>Oui.</i>
4555426 4558387 [Siren Wailing<br />In Distance]<br />[Dog Barking]
4559847 4561766 Hard day at the office?
4561849 4563768 Pretty hard.
4563851 4566062 Got in a fight.
4566145 4568314 Poor baby.
4568397 4570941 Can you make spoons?
4571025 4573903 You know what?<br />I was thinkin' about<br />takin' a shower.
4574028 4577948 I'm stinkin' like a dog<br />over here.<br />I like the way you stink.
4578032 4580451 Let me take this jacket off.
4582620 4586165 I was looking at myself<br />in the mirror.<br />Uh-huh.
4586248 4588167 I wish I had a pot.
4589960 4593881 You were looking<br />at yourself in the mirror<br />and you wish you had some pot?
4593964 4596884 A pot. [Giggles]<br />A pot belly.
4596967 4599095 Pot bellies are sexy.
4599178 4601472 Well, you should be happy...<br />[Grunts]
4601555 4603474 'Cause you have one.
4603557 4607019 Shut up, fatso.<br />I don't have a pot.
4607103 4610940 I have a bit of a tummy,<br />like Madonna when she did<br />"Lucky Star."
4611023 4612942 It's not the same thing.
4613025 4616946 I didn't know there was<br />such a difference between<br />a pot belly and a tummy.
4617029 4618948 The difference is huge.
4619031 4622451 [Kissing]<br />Would you like it<br />if I had a pot belly?
4622535 4624453 No.
4624537 4628958 Pot bellies make a man<br />look either oafish<br />or like a gorilla.
4629041 4632128 But on a woman<br />a pot belly's very sexy.
4632211 4637633 The rest of you is normal...<br />normal face, normal legs,<br />normal hips, normal ass...
4637716 4641762 but with a big,<br />perfectly round pot belly.
4641846 4644765 If I had one,<br />I'd wear a T-shirt<br />two sizes too small...
4644849 4646767 to accentuate it.
4646851 4649270 You think men<br />would find that attractive?
4649353 4652523 I don't give a damn<br />what men find attractive.
4652606 4656068 It's unfortunate what we find pleasing<br />to the touch and pleasing to the eye...
4656152 4658070 is seldom the same.
4659363 4661407 [Sighs]
4661490 4665035 If you had a pot belly,<br />I would punch you in it.
4665161 4668080 You'd punch me in the belly?<br />Right in the belly.
4668164 4670040 Ohh! I'd smother you!
4670166 4674086 I'd drop it right on your face<br />'til you couldn't breathe!<br />[Laughing]
4674170 4676088 You'd do that?<br />Yeah.
4676172 4678090 Promise?<br />Yeah.
4678174 4680551 [Moaning Softly]
4681635 4683554 Mmm.<br />Mmm.
4683637 4685723 [Moaning, Laughing]
4685806 4688225 Oh.<br />[Inhaling]
4688309 4690227 [Grunting]
4691687 4693564 Did you get everything?
4693689 4696650 Yes, I did.<br />Good job, sugar pop.
4696734 4698611 Did everything go as planned?
4698736 4701488 You didn't listen to the...<br />Ow!<br />[Giggles]
4701572 4703449 You didn't listen to the radio?
4703532 4706827 I never listen to your fights.<br />Were you the winner?
4706911 4709163 I won, all right.
4709288 4712249 Are you still retiring?<br />Sure am.
4712333 4714710 So it all worked out<br />in the finish.
4716128 4719548 We're not at the finish<br />yet, baby.
4719632 4722134 [Moaning]
4727514 4730392 We're in a lot of danger,<br />aren't we?
4731936 4734897 If they find us, they'll kill us,<br />won't they?
4736941 4739902 But they won't find us,<br />will they?
4742780 4745741 Do you still want me<br />to go with you?
4747284 4750955 I don't want to be<br />a burden or a nuisance. It's...
4753207 4756126 [Moans]
4757586 4759880 Say it.
4760005 4762591 [Moans]<br />Fabienne,
4762675 4765803 I want you to be with me.
4765886 4768889 Forever?<br />Forever and ever.
4771016 4772977 Do you love me?
4773060 4775062 Very, very much.
4775145 4778065 [Moaning]
4780776 4783320 Butch.<br />Yes?
4784780 4787366 Will you give me<br />oral pleasure?
4788867 4790828 Will you kiss it?
4792746 4794915 But you first.
4794999 4797835 Okay.<br />Okay.

4829408 4831785 [Butch]<br />I think I cracked a rib.
4831910 4835289 Giving me oral pleasure?<br />No, retard,<br />from the fight.
4835414 4838792 Don't call me "retard."<br />[Slurred Voice]<br />My name is Fabby.
4838917 4841378 My name is Fabienne!<br />Stop it.
4841503 4843422 Stop it!<br />My name is Fabi...
4843505 4846425 Shut up, fuckhead!<br />I hate that mongoloid voice.
4846508 4849553 Okay, okay.<br />Sorry, sorry, sorry.
4849678 4852598 [Water Stops]<br />[Butch]<br />I take it back.
4854600 4857519 Will you hand me a dry towel,<br />Miss Beautiful Tulip?
4857603 4861523 Oh, I like that.<br />I like being called a tulip.<br />[Coughs]
4861607 4864026 "Tulip" is much better<br />than "mongoloid."
4864109 4867029 I didn't call you a mongoloid.<br />I called you a retard.
4867112 4869239 And I took it back.
4869323 4871408 [Grunts]<br />Butch?
4871492 4873369 Yes, lemon pie?
4873494 4876914 Where are we<br />going to go?<br />Well, I'm not sure yet.
4876997 4879124 Wherever you want.
4879208 4882127 We're gonna get a lot<br />of money from this,
4882211 4885130 but it ain't gonna be<br />the kind of money...
4885214 4888133 that we can live like hogs<br />in the fathouse forever.
4888217 4892137 I was thinking maybe<br />we could go down someplace<br />in the South Pacific.
4892221 4895599 Kind of money<br />we're gonna have's gonna<br />carry us a long way down there.
4895724 4898644 If we wanted, we could<br />live in Bora Bora?<br />You betcha.
4898727 4902147 And if after a while<br />you didn't dig that,<br />we could go someplace else.
4902231 4904149 Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.
4904233 4906151 But I do not<br />speak Spanish.
4906235 4909196 Well, you do not speak<br />Bora-Boran either.

6598801 6602179 Come on. Get your shit.<br />We gotta go right now.<br />I was so worried.
6602304 6605682 What about our bags?<br />Fuck the bags; if we don't split<br />right now, we'll miss the train.
6605808 6607684 I'll be downstairs.<br />Is everything well?
6607810 6611730 Just come on!<br />No talking now!<br />Are we in danger?
6611814 6613732 [Groaning Continues]
6615234 6617152 Come on, honey!
6619238 6621657 Where did you get<br />this motorcycle?
6621740 6626245 - It's not a motorcycle, baby.<br />It's a chopper. Let's go.<br />- What happened to my Honda?
6626328 6630082 I'm sorry, baby,<br />I had to crash that Honda.<br />Will you come on now, please?
6630165 6632626 Come on, let's go,<br />let's go, let's go.
6637172 6640592 You're hurt?<br />No, no, I might've broken<br />my nose. It's no biggie.
6640676 6643595 Come on. Hop on.<br />Baby, please, we...
6643679 6646640 Honey, we gotta hit<br />the fuckin' road! Get on!
6648308 6651728 Oh, baby, I'm sorry.<br />Come here, come here.<br />[Weeping Quietly]
6651812 6653689 I'm sorry. Mmm.
6653814 6657734 I'm so sorry.<br />You were gone so long, I started<br />to think dreadful thoughts.
6657818 6660737 I didn't mean to worry you.<br />Everything's fine.
6660821 6662739 How was your breakfast?<br />It was good.
6662823 6664741 Did you get<br />the blueberry pancakes?
6664825 6668745 They didn't have blueberry;<br />I had to get buttermilk.<br />Are you sure you're okay?
6668829 6671748 Since I left you, this has been,<br />without a doubt,
6671832 6675043 the single weirdest<br />fuckin' day of my life...<br />I'll tell you all about it.
6675127 6676920 Gotta go. Come on.
6677004 6679756 Butch, whose motorcycle is this?
6679882 6682467 It's a chopper, baby.<br />Whose chopper is this?
6682551 6684469 Zed's.<br />Who's Zed?
6684553 6687097 Zed's dead, baby.<br />Zed's dead.
6687181 6689558 [Engine Starts]
6703280 6705574 [Jules]<br />Yes, you did, Brett!
6705657 6709119 You tried to fuck him,<br />and Marsellus Wallace<br />don't liked to be fucked...
6709244 6711622 by anybody<br />except Mrs. Wallace.<br />[Panting]
6711747 6714833 Oh, God, please,<br />I don't wanna die.<br />You read the Bible, Brett?
6714917 6718337 [Whimpering] Yes!<br />Well, there's this passage<br />I got memorized.
6718420 6720589 Sorta fits the occasion.
6720672 6723967 Ezekiel 25:17.
6724051 6728347 "The path of the righteous man<br />is beset on all sides...
6728430 6730349 "by the inequities of the selfish...
6730432 6733852 "and the tyranny of evil men.<br />[Whimpering Continues]
6733936 6738565 "Blessed is he who,<br />in the name of charity<br />and good will,
6738649 6741693 "shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness,
6741777 6744279 "for he is truly<br />his brother's keeper...
6744363 6747074 "and the finder of lost children.
6747157 6751411 "And I will strike down upon thee<br />with great vengeance...
6751495 6753664 "and furious anger...
6753747 6758126 "those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy my brothers.
6758210 6762047 "And you will know<br />my name is the Lord...
6762130 6765509 when I lay my vengeance<br />upon thee."
6765592 6768095 - [Groans Loudly]<br />- [Gunshots]
6768178 6770138 [Screams]
6773600 6776019 I'm fucked.<br />Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
6776144 6779064 [Vincent]<br />Is he a friend of yours?<br />Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.
6779147 6782025 [Jules] Hmm? Oh.<br />Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.
6782150 6785070 Better tell him to shut up.<br />He's gettin' on my nerves.<br />Fuck. [Muttering]
6785153 6788323 Marvin. Marvin!<br />I'd knock that shit off<br />if I was you.
6788407 6792577 - [Door Slams]<br />- Die, you motherfuckers! Die!
6792661 6794830 [Hammer Clicking]
6820731 6824151 Why the fuck didn't you tell us<br />somebody was in the bathroom?
6824234 6827112 Slip your mind?<br />Did you forget that<br />someone was in there...
6827195 6829072 with a goddamn hand cannon?
6829156 6833118 You see the size of that gun<br />he fired at us?<br />It was bigger than him.
6837873 6840584 We should be<br />fuckin' dead, man.
6840667 6842586 I know.<br />We was lucky.
6842669 6845756 No, no, no, no.<br />That shit wasn't luck.
6845839 6850052 - Yeah, maybe.<br />- This was divine intervention.
6850135 6852054 You know what<br />divine intervention is?
6857934 6859853 I think so.
6859936 6863357 That means that God<br />came down from heaven<br />and stopped the bullets.
6863440 6865859 That's right.<br />That's exactly what it means.
6865942 6868904 God came down from heaven<br />and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.
6870155 6872115 I think it's time for us<br />to leave, Jules.
6872199 6874576 Don't do that.<br />Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!
6874659 6878622 - What just happened here<br />was a fuckin' miracle!<br />- Chill. This shit happens.
6878705 6881458 Wrong! Wrong. This shit<br /><i>doesn't</i> "just happen."
6881541 6884961 Do you want to continue<br />this theological discussion<br />in a car...
6885045 6887506 or in a jailhouse with the cops?
6887589 6890175 We should be fuckin' dead,<br />my friend!
6890258 6894471 What happened here was a miracle,<br />and I want you to fucking<br />acknowledge it!
6894554 6899267 All right, it was a miracle.<br />Can we go now?
6906274 6909653 Let's go, nigger!<br />Come on! Shit.
6911405 6913365 [Vincent]<br />You ever seen that show <i>Cops?</i>
6913448 6916368 I was watching it one time<br />and there was this cop on,
6916451 6920372 and he was talkin' about this<br />gunfight he had in the hallway<br />with this guy, right?
6920455 6923875 He just unloaded on this guy<br />and nothin' happened.<br />He didn't hit nothin'.
6923959 6926878 Okay? It was just him and this guy.
6926962 6930298 I mean, you know,<br />it's-it's freaky, but it happens.
6930382 6935303 You wanna play blind man, go<br />walk with the shepherd, but me,<br />my eyes are wide fuckin' open.
6935387 6938306 - What the fuck does that mean?<br />- It means that's it for me.
6938390 6941017 From here on in, you can<br />consider my ass retired.
6941143 6943311 Jesus Christ.<br />Goddamn it.<br />Don't blaspheme.
6943395 6946440 - I said, don't do that!<br />- Hey, why are you fuckin'<br />freakin' out on us?
6946523 6949568 Look, I'm tellin'<br />Marsellus today... I'm through.
6949651 6952571 - Why don't you tell him<br />at the same time why?<br />- Don't worry, I will.
6952654 6956658 - And I bet you $ 10,000<br />he laughs his ass off.<br />- I don't give a damn if he does.
6956741 6959828 [Sighs]<br />Marvin, what do you make of all this?
6959911 6962330 Man, I don't <i>even</i><br />have an opinion.
6962414 6966626 You gotta have an opinion.<br />You think God came down<br />from heaven and stopped...
6966710 6968670 - [Gunshot]<br />- What the fuck's happenin'?
6968795 6970672 Aw, shit, man!<br />Aw, man!
6970797 6973717 Oh, man, I shot Marvin<br />in the face.<br />Why the fuck'd you do that?
6973800 6975677 I didn't mean it.<br />It was an accident.
6975802 6978722 Man, I seen some crazy-ass<br />shit in my time, but this...<br />Chill out, man!
6978805 6981725 It was an accident.<br />We probably went over<br />a bump or somethin'.
6981808 6983727 The car ain't hit<br />no motherfuckin' bump.
6983810 6987105 I didn't mean to shoot<br />the son of a bitch. The gun went off.
6987189 6990567 Look at this fuckin' mess!<br />We're on a city street<br />in broad daylight here!
6990692 6993612 I don't believe it!<br />Well, believe it now,<br />motherfucker!
6993695 6997115 We gotta get this car off the road.<br />Cops notice shit like a car<br />drenched in blood.
6997240 7000160 Just take it to a friendly<br />place, that's all!<br />This is the Valley, Vincent.
7000243 7002621 Marsellus ain't got<br />no friendly places<br />in the Valley.
7002746 7005624 Well, Jules, this ain't<br />my fuckin' town, man!<br />Shit!
7005749 7008627 What you doing?<br />I'm calling my partner<br />in Toluca Lake.
7008752 7012297 Where's Toluca Lake?<br />Over the hill here,<br />by Burbank Studios.
7012380 7015300 If Jimmie's ass ain't home,<br />I don't know what the fuck<br />we gonna do,
7015383 7018303 'cause I ain't got<br />no other partners in 818.
7018386 7021306 Jimmie, how you doin', man?<br />It's Jules. Just listen up, man.
7021389 7025310 Me and my homeboy<br />are in a car, and we gotta<br />get it off the road, pronto.
7025393 7027562 I need to use your garage<br />for a couple hours.
7029064 7031983 We gotta be real fuckin' delicate<br />with this Jimmie situation.
7032067 7035654 He's one remark away<br />from kickin' our asses<br />out the door.
7035779 7038698 If he does, what do we do?<br />We ain't leavin'<br />'til we make a couple calls,
7038782 7041701 but I don't want it<br />to reach that pitch...<br />Jimmie's a friend.
7041785 7044704 You don't come<br />into your friend's house<br />and start tellin' him what's what.
7044788 7046706 Just tell him<br />not to be abusive.
7046790 7048708 He kinda freaked out back there<br />when he saw Marvin.
7048792 7051962 Put yourself in his position...<br />It's 8:00 in the morning,<br />he just woke up.
7052045 7053964 He wasn't expectin' this shit.
7054047 7056967 We gotta remember here<br />who's doin' who a favor.
7057050 7060929 If that favor means I gotta<br />take shit, he can stick that<br />favor straight up his ass.
7061054 7064933 Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd<br />you just do to his towel, man?<br />I was dryin' my hands!
7065058 7067936 You're supposed<br />to wash 'em first!<br />You watched me wash 'em.
7068061 7071606 I watched you get 'em wet.<br />I was washin' 'em.<br />This shit's hard to get off.
7071690 7073608 Maybe if he'd had Lava<br />I coulda done a better job.
7073692 7075610 I used the same<br />fuckin' soap you did,
7075694 7078613 and when I finished,<br />the towel didn't look like<br />no goddamn maxi-pad!
7078697 7081616 What if he was to come in here<br />and see his towel like this?
7081700 7085787 It's shit like this that's<br />gonna bring this situation<br />to a head, man!
7085870 7089291 Look, I ain't threatenin' you<br />or nothin', all right?
7089374 7093837 You know I respect you and all.<br />But just don't put me<br />in this position, all right?
7093920 7096590 All right.<br />Fine. Fine.
7096673 7099593 Ask me nice like that,<br />no problem.
7099676 7102637 Just go handle your friend.<br />Go ahead. I don't care.
7104347 7107225 Mmm!<br />Goddamn, Jimmie!
7107309 7109352 This some serious<br />gourmet shit.
7109436 7111396 Me and Vincent<br />would've been satisfied...
7111479 7113398 with some freeze-dried<br />Taster's Choice.
7113481 7115400 Right?<br />[Chuckles]
7115483 7118403 And he springs this<br />serious gourmet shit on us.
7118486 7120530 - What flavor is this?<br />- Knock it off, Julie.
7120614 7124659 - What?<br />- I don't need you to tell me<br />how fuckin' good my coffee is.
7124743 7127245 I'm the one who buys it.<br />I know how good it is.
7127329 7129205 When Bonnie goes shopping,<br />she buys shit.
7129289 7132917 I buy the gourmet expensive<br />stuff 'cause when I drink it,<br />I wanna taste it.
7133001 7136921 But you know what's on<br />my mind right now? It ain't<br />the coffee in my kitchen.
7137005 7139174 It's the dead nigger<br />in my garage.
7139257 7142677 - Jimmie, don't even worry...<br />- Don't tell me about anything.<br />I wanna ask you a question.
7142761 7144679 When you came pulling in here,
7144763 7147932 did you notice the sign on<br />the front of my house that said,<br />"Dead nigger storage"?
7148016 7151436 - You know I ain't seen no...<br />- Did you notice the sign on<br />the front of my house...
7151519 7153438 that said,<br />"Dead nigger storage"?
7153521 7156232 No. I didn't.
7156358 7159235 You know why you didn't<br />see that sign?<br />[Sighs] Why?
7159319 7163865 'Cause it ain't there,<br />'cause storing dead niggers<br />ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!
7163948 7166868 - We're not gonna<br />store the motherfucker...<br />- Don't you fuckin' realize...
7166951 7171373 that if Bonnie comes home<br />and finds a dead body in her house,<br />I'm gonna get divorced?
7171456 7174668 No marriage counselor.<br />No trial separation.<br />I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.
7174751 7178088 Okay? And I don't wanna<br />get fuckin' divorced!
7178171 7183176 Man, you know, fuck,<br />I wanna help you, but I don't<br />wanna lose my wife doin' it.
7183259 7185345 Jimmie, Jimmie,<br />she ain't gonna leave you.
7185428 7189349 Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me,<br />Jules! Okay?<br />Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.
7189432 7193395 There's nothin' you're gonna<br />say that's gonna make me forget<br />I love my wife. Is there?
7196523 7201194 Now, look, you know,<br />she comes home from work<br />in about an hour and a half.
7201277 7203905 The graveyard shift at the hospital.
7203988 7207492 You gotta make some phone calls?<br />You gotta call some people?
7207575 7211496 Well, then, do it, and then<br />get the fuck out of my house<br />before she gets here.
7211579 7214499 That's Kool and the Gang.<br />We don't wanna fuck<br />your shit up.
7214582 7217502 All I wanna do is<br />call my people and<br />get 'em to bring us in.
7217585 7220505 You're fucking my shit up<br />right now!
7220588 7223675 You're gonna fuck my shit up<br />big time if Bonnie comes home.
7223758 7227262 Do me that favor, all right?<br />The phone is in my bedroom.<br />I suggest you get going.
7227345 7230265 Well, say she comes home.
7230348 7232767 What do you think she'll do?
7234269 7236688 Oh, no fuckin' shit<br />she'll freak.
7236771 7238982 That ain't no kinda answer.
7239065 7242110 I mean, you know, I don't.<br />How much? A lot or a little?
7242193 7245029 You got to appreciate<br />what an explosive element...
7245113 7247031 this Bonnie situation is.
7247115 7251035 <i>She comes home from a hard<br />day's work, finds a bunch of<br />gangsters in her kitchen...</i>
7251119 7253037 <i>doing a bunch<br />of gangster shit,</i>

7260378 7262964 All I'm doing is<br />contemplating the ifs.
7263047 7265967 I don't wanna hear about<br />no motherfuckin' ifs!
7266050 7269971 All I want to hear from your ass<br />is, "You ain't got no problem,<br />Jules, I'm on the motherfucker.
7270054 7274184 Chill them niggers out and wait<br />for the cavalry, which should<br />be coming directly."
7274267 7277437 You ain't got<br />no problem, Jules.
7277520 7279647 I'm on the motherfucker.
7279731 7284778 Chill them niggers out<br />and wait for the Wolf, who<br />should be coming directly.
7284861 7287280 You sendin' the Wolf?
7287363 7289532 Oh, you feel better,<br />motherfucker?
7289616 7291910 Shit, yeah, negro!

7414574 7417118 Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
7419203 7422624 About the car, is there anything<br />I need to know? Does it stall?
7422707 7426085 Does it smoke? Does it<br />make a lot of noise?<br />Is there gas in it?
7426210 7429631 Aside from how it looks,<br />the car's cool.<br />Positive?
7429714 7433092 Don't get me on the road<br />and I find out the brake<br />lights don't work.
7433217 7437263 As far as I know,<br />the motherfucker's tip-top.<br />Good enough.
7437347 7439349 Let's go back to the kitchen.
7442518 7444896 [Exhales]
7445021 7447982 Here you go,<br />Mr. Wolf.<br />Thank you, Jimmie.
7452820 7454739 Mmm.
7455823 7457909 Okay, first thing.<br />You two.
7457992 7460912 Take the body,<br />stick it in the trunk.
7460995 7463665 This looks to be<br />a pretty domesticated house.
7463790 7467752 That would lead me to believe<br />you got cleansers and shit.<br />Yeah. Under the sink.
7467835 7471255 Good. What I need you<br />two fellas to do is take<br />those cleaning products...
7471339 7475343 and clean the inside<br />of the car... I'm talkin'<br />fast, fast, fast.
7475426 7479347 Go in the back seat,<br />scoop up all those little<br />pieces of brain and skull.
7479430 7482350 Get it out of there.<br />Wipe down the upholstery.
7482433 7485353 It don't need<br />to be spick-and-span.<br />You don't need to eat off it.
7485436 7489774 Just give it a good once-over.<br />What you need to take care of<br />are the really messy parts.
7489857 7493945 The pools of blood<br />that have collected,<br />you gotta soak that shit up.
7494028 7496447 We need to raid<br />your linen closet.
7496531 7499450 I need blankets,<br />I need comforters,<br />quilts, bedspreads.
7499534 7503162 The thicker the better,<br />the darker the better.<br />No whites. Can't use 'em.
7503246 7508543 We'll need to camouflage<br />the front seat and back seat<br />and floorboards...
7508626 7510545 with quilts and blankets,
7510628 7514549 so if a cop starts stickin'<br />his big snout in the car,<br />the subterfuge won't last,
7514632 7517468 but at a glance the car<br />will appear to be normal.
7517552 7519595 Jimmie, lead the way.<br />Boys, get to work.
7519679 7521431 "Please" would be nice.
7522890 7525893 - Come again?<br />- I said, a "please" would be nice.
7527729 7531607 Get it straight, Buster.<br />I'm not here to say please.<br />I'm here to tell you what to do.
7533401 7536320 And if self-preservation<br />is an instinct you possess,
7536404 7538823 you'd better fuckin' do it<br />and do it quick.
7538906 7542785 I'm here to help.<br />If my help's not appreciated,<br />lotsa luck, gentlemen.
7542869 7546164 No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't<br />like that; your help<br />is definitely appreciated.
7546247 7549167 Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't<br />mean disrespect, okay?<br />I respect you.
7549250 7552086 I just don't like people<br />barkin' orders at me.
7552170 7555173 If I'm curt with you,<br />it's because time is a factor.
7555256 7559886 I think fast, I talk fast,<br />and I need you guys to act fast<br />if you wanna get out of this.
7559969 7563431 So pretty please,<br />with sugar on top,<br />clean the fuckin' car.
7567935 7571606 Don't be lookin' at me<br />like that, all right?<br />I can feel your look.
7574317 7576986 It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
7577070 7578988 [Sipping]
7579072 7580990 Green.
7582617 7585536 Nothin' except for<br />the mess inside.
7587747 7590166 Mmm, about 20 minutes.
7591667 7593628 Nobody who'll be missed.
7595671 7598633 You're a good man, Joe.<br />Thanks a bunch.
7599717 7601636 How we comin',<br />Jimmie?<br />Pretty good.
7601719 7604847 I got it all here, but, uh,<br />[Sighs]
7604972 7608392 Mr. Wolf, you gotta<br />understand something.<br />Winston, Jimmie, Winston.
7608476 7611979 Okay. You gotta<br />understand something,<br />uh, Winston.
7612063 7613981 Uh... Uh, no,<br />thank you.
7614065 7617193 Uh, this is our<br />best linen here,
7617276 7620196 and it's, uh...<br />it was a wedding present...
7620279 7622657 from my Uncle Conrad<br />and my Aunt Ginny.
7622782 7627203 They're not with us<br />anymore. I wanna help...<br />Let me ask you a question.
7627286 7630206 If you don't mind.<br />No, no, please.<br />Go ahead.
7631791 7636671 Your Uncle Conrad<br />and Aunt ginny,<br />were they millionaires?
7637839 7639757 No.
7639841 7642260 Well, your<br />Uncle Marsellus is.
7642343 7645721 And I'm positive<br />that if Uncle Conrad<br />and Aunt...
7645847 7648266 Ginny.<br />Ginny were here,
7648349 7652603 they would furnish you<br />with a whole bedroom set,
7652687 7655857 which your Uncle Marsellus<br />is more than happy to do.
7659819 7663739 I like oak myself.<br />That's what I have in my bedroom.
7664866 7666826 How about you, Jimmie?
7668035 7669996 You an oak man?
7671080 7673040 Oak's nice.
7678880 7682717 Oh, man, I will never<br />forgive your ass<br />for this shit.
7682800 7685219 This is some fucked-up,<br />repugnant shit.
7685303 7688723 Jules, did you ever hear<br />the philosophy that once<br />a man admits that he is wrong,
7688806 7691726 that he is immediately forgiven<br />for all wrongdoings?
7691809 7694729 Get the fuck out my face<br />with that shit!
7694812 7697607 The motherfucker that said<br />that shit never had to pick up<br />itty-bitty pieces of skull...
7697732 7701485 on account of your dumb ass.<br />I got a threshold, Jules,<br />for the abuse that I will take.
7701569 7705156 Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,<br />and you got me in the red.
7705239 7708659 I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous<br />to have a race car in the fuckin' red.
7708743 7710620 That's all. I could blow.
7710745 7712663 Oh, you ready to blow?<br />Yeah.
7712747 7715666 Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'<br />motherfucker, motherfucker.
7715750 7718669 Every time my fingers touch brain,<br />I'm Superfly T.N.T.
7718753 7720671 I'm the Guns<br />of the Navarone.
7720755 7723674 In fact, what the fuck<br />am I doin' in the back?
7723758 7727011 You're the motherfucker<br />should be on brain detail!<br />We're fuckin' switchin'!
7727094 7729555 I'm washin' windows,<br />you're pickin' up<br />this nigger's skull!
7739273 7741234 Fine job, gentlemen.
7742568 7744987 You may get out<br />of this yet.
7745071 7747490 I can't believe<br />this is the same car.
7747573 7750993 Well, let's not start suckin'<br />each other's dicks quite yet.
7751077 7754497 Phase one is complete...<br />clean the car... which moves<br />us right along to phase two:
7754580 7756499 clean you two.
7758084 7759919 Strip.
7760044 7763798 All the way?<br />[Wolf]<br />To your bare ass.
7763881 7766926 Quickly, gentlemen.<br />We got about 15 minutes...
7767009 7769929 before Jimmie's better half<br />comes pulling into the driveway.
7770012 7772515 Goddamn, this morning air<br />is some chilly shit.
7772598 7774517 Are you sure this is<br />absolutely necessary?
7774600 7777019 You know what you two<br />look like?<br />[Vincent] What?
7777103 7780523 Like a couple of guys<br />who just blew off<br />somebody's head.
7780606 7783985 Strippin' off those bloody rags<br />is absolutely necessary.
7788281 7790741 Toss 'em in Jimmie's<br />garbage bag.
7790825 7795246 Don't do nothin' stupid,<br />like leavin' this shit out front<br />for the garbageman to pick up.
7795329 7799542 Don't worry,<br />we're taking it with us.<br />Jim, the soap.
7801002 7802920 Vincent.<br />[Wolf]<br />Okay, gentlemen.
7803004 7806465 You both been to county<br />before, I'm sure. Here it comes.
7806590 7809468 Goddamn!<br />The water's fuckin' cold!<br />Yo! Yo! Yo!
7809552 7812722 Better you than me,<br />gentlemen.<br />[Chuckling]
7812847 7815766 Don't be afraid of the soap.<br />Spread it around.<br />[Yelling Continues]
7815850 7818728 - Get 'em there a little bit.<br />Vincent's hair.<br />- Hey, get out of my hair!
7818811 7821689 - Come on, do it,<br />goddamn it! Do it!<br />- Uh, um...
7822773 7824692 Towel.
7835202 7838372 [Wolf]<br />You're dry enough.<br />Toss 'em their clothes.
7838456 7841751 [Wolf Laughing]<br />Perfect.
7841834 7845254 Perfect. We couldn't have<br />planned this better.
7845338 7847256 You guys look like...
7847340 7849717 What do they look like,<br />Jimmie?
7849842 7853429 Dorks. They look like<br />a couple of dorks.<br />[Laughing]
7853512 7857016 - [Both Laughing]<br />- Ha-ha-ha. They're your<br />clothes, motherfucker.
7857099 7859810 Come on, gentlemen.<br />We're laughing our way<br />right into prison.
7859894 7861854 Don't make me beg.
7864899 7868319 Okay, gentlemen,<br />let's get our rules<br />of the road straight.
7868402 7871947 We're going to a place<br />called Monster Joe's<br />Truck and Tow.
7872031 7874950 Monster Joe and his daughter<br />Raquel are sympathetic<br />to our dilemma.
7875034 7876911 The place is North Hollywood,
7876994 7880998 so a few twists and turns<br />aside, we'll be goin' up<br />Hollywood Way.
7881082 7884418 Now, I'll drive<br />the tainted car.<br />Jules, you ride with me.
7885795 7887755 Vincent, you follow<br />in my Acura.
7887838 7891675 Now, if we come<br />across the path<br />of any John Q. Laws,
7891801 7894887 nobody does a fuckin' thing<br />'til I do something.<br />Right.
7895012 7897848 What did I say?<br />Don't do shit unless.
7897973 7900267 Unless what?<br />Unless you do it first.
7900351 7902728 Spoken like a true prodigy.
7902812 7906232 How about you, Lash LaRue?<br />Can you keep your spurs<br />from jingling and jangling?
7906315 7910444 The gun went off.<br />I don't know why.<br />I'm cool, I promise you.
7910528 7913447 Fair enough. Now, I drive real<br />fuckin' fast, so keep up.
7913531 7916033 If I get my car back any<br />different than I gave it,
7916117 7918994 Monster Joe's gonna be<br />disposing of two bodies.
7919078 7922790 [Metal Door Slamming]<br />[Engine Idling]
7922873 7924583 Outta my way, Rex.
7926127 7928546 - We cool?<br />- Like it never happened.
7928629 7932383 - [Vincent] All right.<br />- Boys, this is Raquel.
7932466 7935094 Someday all this<br />will be hers.
7935177 7937972 Hi. So, what's with the outfits?
7938097 7941517 You guys going to a<br />volleyball game or something?<br />[Wolf Laughs]
7941600 7944061 I'm takin' milady<br />out to breakfast.
7944145 7946814 Maybe I could<br />drop you two off.<br />Where do you live?
7946939 7948315 Redondo.<br />Inglewood.
7948399 7951819 It's...<br />It's your future. I...
7951902 7954655 I see a...<br />a cab ride.
7954738 7957700 Move outta the sticks, fellas.<br />Say good night, Raquel.
7957783 7960703 Good night, Raquel.<br />I'll see you guys<br />around.
7960786 7963205 Stay outta trouble,<br />you crazy kids.
7963289 7967209 Mr. Wolf, I just wanna<br />tell you it was a real<br />pleasure watching you work.
7967293 7970212 Yeah, really. And thank<br />you very much, Mr. Wolf.
7970296 7972214 Call me Winston.
7973799 7976677 You see that, young lady?<br />Respect.<br />[Alarm Deactivates]
7976802 7980931 Respect for one's elders<br />shows character.<br />I have character.
7981056 7985060 Because you <i>are</i> a character doesn't<br />mean that you <i>have</i> character.<br />[Chuckles]
7991650 7994570 [Tires Screeching]<br />Wanna share a cab?
7994695 7998949 I'd go for some breakfast.<br />Feel like havin' breakfast with me?<br />[Phone Dialing]
7999033 8001702 Cool.
8005831 8008918 I don't know why, I just thought<br />he'd be European or something.
8009043 8012421 Yeah, he's about as European<br />as fuckin' English Bob.<br />I know that now.
8012546 8014965 But was he cool<br />or what?<br />Thank you.
8015049 8017468 Totally fuckin' cool,<br />in control.
8017551 8021555 Didn't even really get<br />pissed when you were fuckin'<br />with him; I was amazed.
8021680 8024266 [Chuckles]<br />Want some bacon?
8024350 8026227 No, man,<br />I don't eat pork.
8026352 8029730 Are you Jewish?<br />I ain't Jewish; I just don't<br />dig on swine, that's all.
8029855 8032775 Why not?<br />Pigs are filthy animals.
8032858 8034777 I don't eat filthy animals.
8034860 8038280 Yeah, but bacon tastes good.<br />Pork chops taste good.
8038364 8041283 Sewer rat may taste<br />like pumpkin pie,<br />but I'd never know...
8041367 8044286 'cause I wouldn't eat<br />the filthy motherfuckers.
8044370 8047289 Pigs sleep and root in shit.<br />That's a filthy animal.
8047373 8051252 I ain't eatin' nothin'<br />ain't got sense enough to<br />disregard its own feces.
8051377 8055673 How about a dog?<br />Dog eats its own feces.<br />I don't eat dog either.
8055756 8059093 Yeah, but do you consider<br />a dog to be a filthy animal?
8059176 8062096 I wouldn't go so far<br />as to call a dog filthy,
8062179 8064056 but they're definitely dirty.
8064181 8068310 But a dog's got personality.<br />Personality goes a long way.<br />Ah, so, by that rationale,
8068394 8071897 if a pig had a better personality,<br />he would cease to be a filthy animal.
8072022 8075943 Is that true?<br />We'd have to be talkin' about<br />one charming motherfuckin' pig.
8076026 8080030 I mean, he'd have to be<br />10 times more charming than<br />that Arnold on <i>Green Acres.</i>
8080114 8083158 [Both Laughing]
8085661 8087788 Oh, man, that's good.
8087871 8091458 That's good, man.<br />You're startin' to lighten up.
8091542 8094461 You've been sittin' there,<br />all serious and shit.
8094587 8097047 I just been<br />sittin' here, thinkin'.<br />About what?
8097131 8100050 - About the miracle we witnessed.<br />- Miracle <i>you</i> witnessed.
8100134 8103345 - I witnessed a freak occurrence.<br />- What is a miracle, Vincent?
8105306 8108475 Act of God.<br />And what's an act of God?
8111979 8115816 When, um, God makes<br />the impossible possible.
8116817 8118694 But this morning...
8118819 8121530 I don't think qualifies.<br />Hey, Vincent.
8121614 8125326 See, that shit don't matter.<br />You're judging this shit<br />the wrong way.
8125409 8130331 It could be God stopped<br />the bullets, changed Coke to<br />Pepsi, found my car keys.
8130414 8133375 You don't judge shit<br />like this based on merit.
8133459 8135919 Now, whether or not<br />what we experienced...
8136003 8139131 was an According-to-Hoyle<br />miracle is insignificant.
8139214 8142968 But what is significant is,<br />I felt the touch of God.
8143052 8144970 God got involved.
8145054 8146764 But why?
8146847 8149892 Well, that's what's<br />fuckin' with me:<br />I don't know why.
8149975 8152936 - But I can't go back to sleep.<br />- You're serious.
8153020 8154855 You're really thinkin' about quittin'.
8154980 8157650 For life?<br />Most definitely.<br />Yeah.
8157733 8161070 Fuck.<br />What you gonna do then?
8162404 8166617 Well, that's what I been<br />sitting here contemplating.
8166700 8170287 First I'm gonna deliver<br />this case to Marsellus.
8170371 8173457 Then, basically, I'm just<br />gonna walk the earth.
8173540 8176960 - What you mean, "Walk the earth"?<br />- Like Caine in <i>Kung Fu.</i>
8177044 8180005 Walk from place to place,<br />meet people, get in adventures.
8180089 8182341 And how long do you intend<br />to walk the earth?
8182424 8185719 - 'Til God puts me<br />where he wants me to be.<br />- What if he don't do that?
8185803 8190724 - If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever.<br />- So you decided to be a bum.
8190808 8194436 I'll just be Jules, Vincent.<br />No more, no less.
8194520 8196480 No, Jules,<br />you decided to be a bum,
8196563 8199858 just like all those<br />pieces of shit out there<br />who beg for change,
8199942 8202861 who sleep in garbage bins,<br />eat what I throw away.
8202945 8205906 They got a name for that, Jules...<br />It's called a bum.
8205989 8209660 And without a job, a residence<br />or legal tender, that's what<br />you're gonna be, man.
8209743 8211620 You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.
8211704 8214623 Look, my friend,<br />this is just where you and I differ.
8214707 8217543 Garcon! Coffee!
8217626 8222131 Jules, look,<br />what happened this morning,<br />man, I agree it was peculiar.
8222214 8225300 - But water into wine, I...<br />- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.
8225384 8228512 - Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.<br />- If my answers frighten you,
8228595 8231140 then you should cease<br />asking scary questions.
8234059 8235978 I'm gonna take a shit.
8238856 8241400 Let me ask you something.
8241483 8244862 When did you make this decision,<br />when you were sittin' there<br />eatin' that muffin?
8244945 8248866 Yeah. I was sittin' here<br />eatin' my muffin,<br />drinkin' my coffee,

8764339 8766258 About 1,500 dollars.
8766341 8769511 Okay, put it in your pocket.<br />It's yours.
8769594 8772806 Now, with the rest<br />of those wallets<br />and the register,
8772889 8774975 that makes this<br />a pretty successful<br />little score, huh?

8788655 8791574 Now, I ain't givin' it<br />to him, Vincent.
8791658 8793535 I'm buyin' something<br />for my money.
8794828 8797998 Wanna know what<br />I'm buyin', Ringo?<br />What?
8798081 8802794 Your life. I'm givin' you<br />that money so I don't<br />have to kill your ass.
8802877 8805547 You read the Bible,<br />Ringo?
8806673 8808591 Not regularly, no.
8808675 8811052 Well, there's this passage<br />I got memorized.
8811136 8814681 Ezekiel 25:17.
8814764 8817600 "The path of the righteous man<br />is beset on all sides...
8817684 8819602 "by the inequities of the selfish...
8819686 8821563 "and the tyranny of evil men.
8821646 8825025 "Blessed is he who, in the name of charity<br />and good will,
8825108 8827527 "shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness,
8827610 8831698 "for he is truly his<br />brother's keeper and the<br />finder of lost children.
8831781 8836077 "And I will strike down upon<br />thee with great vengeance<br />and furious anger...
8836161 8839205 "those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy my brothers.
8839289 8842292 "And you will know<br />I am the Lord...
8842375 8845920 when I lay my vengeance<br />upon you."
8847047 8849466 I been sayin' that shit<br />for years,
8849549 8852677 and if you heard it,<br />that meant your ass.
8852761 8855680 I never gave much thought<br />to what it meant.
8855764 8858683 I just thought it was some<br />coldblooded shit to say<br />to a motherfucker...
8858767 8861186 before I popped a cap<br />in his ass.
8861269 8864689 But I saw some shit this morning<br />made me think twice.
8864773 8867692 See, now I'm thinkin'<br />maybe it means...
8867776 8872655 you're the evil man,<br />and I'm the righteous man,
8872739 8875658 and Mr. 9-millimeter here,<br />he's the shepherd...
8875742 8879287 protecting my righteous ass<br />in the Valley of Darkness.
8879371 8881289 Or it could mean...
8881373 8884793 you're the righteous man,<br />and I'm the shepherd,
8884876 8888797 and it's the world<br />that's evil and selfish.
8888880 8891132 Yeah, I'd like that.
8891216 8894094 But that shit ain't the truth.
8894177 8896054 The truth is,
8897097 8899057 you're the weak...
8900433 8903812 and I'm the tyranny<br />of evil men.
8905271 8907190 But I'm tryin', Ringo.
8908441 8911361 I'm tryin' real hard...
8911444 8913738 to be the shepherd.
8929045 8930964 Go.
