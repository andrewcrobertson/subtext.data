27792 31921 Forget it. It's too risky.<br />I'm through doing that shit.
32005 34465 You always say that.<br />The same thing every time.
34549 37468 "I'm through, never<br />again, too dangerous."
37552 40054 I know that's what I always say.<br />I'm always right too.
40138 43516 You forget about it in a day or two.<br />The days of me forgetting are over.
43600 45685 The days of me<br />remembering have just begun.
45769 47895 You know, when you go on<br />like this, what you sound like?
47979 50982 I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.<br />You sound like a duck.
51107 54569 Quack, quack, quack. Take heart, 'cause<br />you're never gonna have to hear it again.
54653 58114 Since I'm never gonna do it again,<br />you're never gonna have to hear me quack.
58198 62869 After tonight? Correct.<br />I got all tonight to quack.
62994 65830 Can I get anyone more coffee? Oh, yes!
67666 70210 Thank you. You're welcome.
70294 73380 I mean, the way it is now,
73464 76258 you're takin' the same risk<br />as when you rob a bank.
76342 78385 Takin' more of a risk. Banks are easier.
78469 81471 Federal banks ain't supposed to<br />stop you in any way during a robbery.
81555 83650 They're insured.<br />Why should they give a fuck?
83734 85767 I don't even need a<br />gun in a federal bank.
85851 89313 Heard about this one bloke, he<br />walks into a bank with a portable phone.
89397 92357 He gives the phone to a teller.<br />The bloke on the other end says,
92441 94072 "We got this guy's little girl.<br />If you don't
94156 95986 give him all your money,<br />we're gonna kill her."
96070 96537 Did it work?
96621 98864 Fuckin' right it worked.<br />That's what I'm talkin' about.
98948 101826 Knucklehead walks into<br />a bank with a telephone,
101910 104745 not a pistol, not a<br />shotgun, a fuckin' phone.
104870 106891 Cleans the place out. They don't lift a
106975 109458 fuckin' finger.<br />Did they hurt the little girl?
109542 111223 There probably never was a little girl.
111307 113253 The point of the<br />story isn't a little girl.
113337 116298 The point of the story is they<br />robbed a bank with a telephone.
116382 119343 -You want to rob banks?<br />-I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.
119427 121845 I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be<br />easier than what we've been doing.
121929 123011 No more liquor stores?
123095 126058 What've we been talkin' about?<br />Yeah, no more liquor stores.
126183 127530 Besides, it ain't the<br />giggle it used to be.
127614 129144 There's too many<br />foreigners own liquor stores.
129228 131146 Vietnamese, Koreans, don't<br />even speak fuckin' English.
131230 133565 You tell 'em empty out the register,<br />they don't know what you're talkin' about.
133649 135526 They make it too personal.
135651 137626 We keep on, one of<br />these gook fuckers gonna
137710 139863 make us kill him.<br />I'm not gonna kill anybody.
139947 142011 I don't want to either.<br />But they'll probably
142095 144242 put us in a situation<br />where it's us or them.
144326 146244 And if it's not the gooks,
146328 148956 it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned<br />the store for 15 fucking generations.
149040 151140 You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the
151224 153460 counter with a fucking<br />Magnum in his hand.
153544 155462 Try walkin' into one of those<br />places with nothing but a phone.
155546 157423 See how far that gets you. Forget it.
157548 160426 We're out of it.<br />Well, what then, day jobs?
160551 162595 Not in this life. What then?
164764 166932 Garçon, coffee!
167016 169310 This place.
170770 173898 "Garçon" means boy.
177109 179778 This place? A coffee shop?
179862 182823 What's wrong with that?
182907 186577 Nobody ever robs restaurants. Why not?
187536 189955 Bars, liquor stores,
190039 193750 gas stations; you get your head<br />blown off stickin' up one of them.
193834 197504 Restaurants, on the other hand,<br />you catch with their pants down.
197588 201217 They're not expectin' to get robbed.<br />Not as expectin' anyway.
201342 205846 I bet you could cut down on the<br />hero factor in a place like this. Correct.
205930 209182 Same as banks, these places are insured.
209266 211602 Manager. He don't give a fuck.
211686 214522 They're just trying to get you out<br />before you start pluggin' the diners.
214606 218568 Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way<br />they're takin' a bullet for the register.
218652 221571 Busboys.<br />Some wetback gettin' paid $1.50 an hour…
221655 224157 Really give a fuck you're<br />stealin' from the owner?
224241 227326 Customers sittin' there with food in their<br />mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.
227410 229687 One minute, they're<br />havin' a Denver omelet, the
229771 232081 next, someone is<br />stickin' a gun in their face.
232165 237211 See, I got the idea the last liquor<br />store we stuck up, remember?
237295 239964 -All the customers kept comin' in.<br />-Yeah.
240048 243885 You got the idea of takin' their wallets.<br />Now, that was a good idea.
243969 244449 Thank you.
244533 247333 Made more from the wallets<br />than we did from the register.
247430 249724 Yes, we did.<br />A lot of people come to restaurants.
249808 253436 -A lot of wallets.<br />-Pretty smart, huh?
253520 255564 Pretty smart.
257107 260068 I'm ready. Let's do it.<br />Right now, right here.
260193 264697 Come on. All right.<br />Same as last time, remember?
264781 267534 You're crowd control.<br />I'll handle the employees.
273206 275959 I love you, pumpkin.<br />I love you, honey bunny.
277169 279629 Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!
279713 282590 Any of you fucking pricks move,
282674 286469 and I'll execute every<br />motherfuckin' last one of you.

423983 428029 Okay, so tell me again about the hash<br />bars. Okay, what you want to know?
428154 430948 Hash is legal there, right?<br />Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.
431032 435661 You just can't walk into a restaurant,<br />roll a joint and start puffin' away.
435745 439081 I mean, they want you to smoke in<br />your home or certain designated places.
439165 441792 Those are hash bars? Yeah.<br />It breaks down like this.
441876 444211 It's legal to buy it.<br />It's legal to own it.
444295 447464 And if you're the proprietor of<br />a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
447548 451969 It's illegal to carry it, but-but that<br />doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.
452053 456432 If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,<br />it's illegal for them to search you.
456557 460477 I mean, that's a right the cops in<br />Amsterdam <i>don't</i> have. Oh, man! I'm goin'.
460561 463105 That's all there is to it.<br />I'm fuckin' goin'.
463189 466067 I know, baby. You'd dig it the most.
466192 468902 But you know what the funniest<br />thing about Europe is? What?
468986 470885 It's the little differences.<br />I mean, they got
470969 472906 the same shit over<br />there that they got here,
472990 475829 but it's just there,<br />it's a little different.
475913 476535 Example.
476619 479746 You can walk into a movie theater<br />in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
479830 483458 And I don't mean just like no paper cup.<br />I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.
483542 487337 And in Paris, you can buy a beer in<br />McDonald's. You know what they call…
487421 490925 A Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
491009 493177 They don't call it a Quarter<br />Pounder with Cheese?
493261 496055 They got the metric system. They wouldn't<br />know what the fuck a quarter-pounder is.
496139 499976 -What do they call it?<br />-They call it a <i>Royale</i> with Cheese.
500102 501561 <i>Royale</i> with Cheese. That's right.
501645 503563 What do they call a Big Mac?
503647 506941 Big Mac's a Big Mac,<br />but they call it <i>Le</i> Big Mac.
507025 510112 [IMITATING FRENCH ACCENT] <i>Le</i> Big Mac.<br />[LAUGHS]
510237 514324 What do they call a Whopper? I don't know.<br />I didn't go into Burger King.
514449 517869 You know what they put on french<br />fries in Holland instead of ketchup? What?
517953 520914 Mayonnaise. [CHUCKLES] Goddamn!
521039 525335 I seen 'em do it, man.<br />They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit. Yuck.
528004 531299 We should have shotguns<br />for this kind of deal.
534302 537013 How many up there? Three or four.
537139 540684 That's countin' our guy? Not sure.
540809 544187 So that means that it could be up<br />to five guys up there? It's possible.
544271 546606 We should have fuckin' shotguns.
546731 549317 What's her name? Mia.
549443 553613 Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?<br />I don't know.
553697 557283 However people meet people.<br />She used to be a actress.
557367 559828 Oh, really?<br />She do anything I'd have seen?
559953 564332 I think her biggest deal was she<br />starred in a pilot. Pilot? What's a pilot?
564458 567960 Well, you know the shows on TV?<br />I don't watch TV.
568044 571631 Yeah, but you are aware that<br />there is an invention called television,
571756 574842 and on this invention they<br />show shows, right? Yeah.
574926 579305 The way they pick TV shows is they<br />make one show. That show's called a pilot.
579389 582308 Then they show that one show<br />to the people who pick shows…
582392 585311 And on the strength of that one show,<br />they decide if they wanna make more shows.
585395 589941 Some get chosen and become television<br />programs. Some don't, become nothin'.
590025 593194 She starred in one of the<br />ones that became nothing.
593278 596030 You remember Antwan Rockamora?
596114 599910 Half-black, half-Samoan.<br />Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror."
600035 603413 Yeah, maybe. Fat, right? I wouldn't<br />go so far as to call the brother fat.
603497 606290 He got a weight problem. I mean,<br />what's a nigga gonna do? He's Samoan.
606374 610795 I think I know who you mean. What<br />about him? Marsellus fucked him up good.
610879 615133 Word 'round the campfire is it was<br />on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
615217 618178 [ELEVATOR BELL RINGS]
623266 627270 So what he'd do? Fuck her?<br />No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.
627395 631067 Well, then what then?<br />He gave her a foot massage.
633319 635530 A foot massage?
635655 637698 That's it? Mm-hmm.
637782 639700 Then what'd Marsellus do?
639784 642953 Sent a couple cats over to his place.<br />They took him out on his patio.
643037 646957 Threw his ass over the balcony.<br />Nigga fell four stories.
647041 651086 He had a little garden down at the bottom<br />enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.
651170 653422 Nigga fell <i>through</i> that.
653506 656425 Since then, he kind of<br />developed a speech impediment.
657927 660638 That's a damn shame. Hmm.
665351 669146 But still, you play with matches,<br />you get burned. What do you mean?
669230 673358 You don't be givin' Marsellus<br />Wallace's new bride a foot massage.
673442 675903 You don't think he overreacted?
675987 678314 Antwan didn't expect<br />Marsellus to react the
678398 680866 way he did, but he<br />had to expect a reaction.
680950 685078 It was a foot massage. A foot massage is<br />nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.
685162 688707 It's laying your hands in a familiar<br />way on Marsellus's new wife.
688791 691031 I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy
691115 693670 out?<br />No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.
693754 695839 Whoa, stop right there.<br />Eatin' the bitch out…
695923 698509 And givin' the bitch a foot massage<br />ain't even the same fucking thing.
698593 702513 It's not. It's the same ballpark.<br />Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.
702597 705516 Now, look, maybe your method<br />of massage differs from mine.
705600 709353 But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking<br />your tongue in the holiest of holies…
709437 711459 Ain't the same fuckin'<br />ballpark; it ain't the
711543 713690 same league; it ain't<br />the same fuckin' sport.
713774 717611 Foot massages don't mean shit!<br />Have you ever given a foot massage?
717695 720740 [SCOFFS] Don't be tellin'<br />me about foot massages.
720865 723534 I'm the foot fuckin' master.<br />You given a lot of them?
723618 725482 Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and
725566 727829 everything.<br />I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.
727913 730583 Would you give a guy a foot massage?
732001 734629 Fuck you. [CHUCKLES]
734754 737798 You give 'em a lot? Fuck you.
737923 741176 You know, I'm kind of tired. I could<br />use a foot massage. Yo, yo, yo, man.
741260 744472 You best back off.<br />I'm gettin' a little pissed here.
745514 748100 This is the door. Yeah, it is.
750853 753480 What time you got?
753564 755691 7:22 in the a.m.
755775 759362 No, it ain't quite time yet.<br />Come on. Let's hang back.
766911 770665 Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no<br />man a foot massage don't make it right…
770749 773960 For Marsellus to throw Antwan off a<br />building into a glass motherfuckin' house,
774044 776754 fuckin' up the way the<br />nigga talks; that shit ain't right.
776838 778720 Motherfucker do that<br />shit to me, he better
778804 781050 paralyze my ass, 'cause<br />I kill the motherfucker.
781134 783558 I ain't sayin' it's right,<br />but you sayin' a foot
783642 786097 massage don't mean nothin'.<br />I'm sayin' it does.
786181 788513 Now, look, I've given<br />a million ladies a million
788597 790810 foot massages, and<br />they all meant somethin'.
790894 794606 We act like they don't, but they do.<br />That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.
794690 796774 There's a sensuous thing goin' on…
796858 800069 Where you don't talk about it,<br />but you know it and she knows it.
800153 805199 Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan<br />should've fuckin' better known better.
805283 807389 That's his fuckin' wife, man.<br />This ain't a
807473 809662 man with a sense of<br />humor about this shit.
809746 812540 You know what I'm sayin'?
812624 814542 It's an interestin' point.
814626 816586 Come on. Let's get into character.
823510 825470 What's her name again? Mia.
825595 828598 Mia.<br />Why you so interested in big man's wife?
828682 831243 He's goin' out of town, Florida.<br />And he asked
831327 833854 me if I'd take care of<br />her while he's gone.
833979 837940 Take care of her?<br />No, man. Just take her out.
838024 841361 Show her a good time.<br />Make sure she don't get lonely.
841445 843988 You're gonna be takin'<br />Mia Wallace out on a date?
844072 846699 It is not a date.
846783 850829 It's just like if you were gonna take<br />your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.
850954 854458 It's just good company, that's all.<br />[SIGHS]
858462 862966 It's not a date.<br />It's definitely not a date. [SIGHS]
869639 873476 Hey, kids. How you boys doin'?
873560 876229 Hey, keep chillin'.
882402 885196 You know who we are?
885280 889242 We're associates of your<br />business partner, Marsellus Wallace.
889326 892329 You do remember your<br />business partner, don't you?
895040 898001 Now, let me take a wild guess here.
900003 903047 -You're Brett, right?<br />-Yeah.
903131 907385 I thought so. You remember your<br />business partner Marsellus Wallace,
907511 911098 don't ya, Brett? Yeah, I remember.
911182 915477 Good. Looks like me and Vincent<br />caught you boys at breakfast.
915561 918188 Sorry about that. Whatcha havin'?
918272 920232 Hamburgers.
920316 924403 Hamburgers! The cornerstone<br />of any nutritious breakfast.
925780 928032 What kind of hamburgers?
928157 929867 Uh, ch... cheeseburgers. No, no, no.
929951 932995 Where'd you get 'em?<br />McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack in the Box?
933120 935914 Where? Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.
935998 939126 Big Kahuna Burger!<br />That's that Hawaiian burger joint.
939210 943130 I hear they got some tasty burgers. I<br />ain't never had one myself. How are they?
943214 945883 They're… They're good.
945967 948594 You mind if I try one of yours?
948678 951097 This is yours here, right? Yeah.
959355 961190 Mmmm.
961274 964401 This <i>is</i> a tasty burger! Vincent!
964485 967029 You ever had a Big Kahuna burger?
968030 970491 Want a bite? They're real tasty.
970616 974036 I ain't hungry. Well, if you like<br />burgers, give 'em a try sometime.
974120 977956 Me, I can't usually get 'em<br />'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,
978040 981168 which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.
981252 984379 But I do love the taste of a good burger.<br />Mmmm.
984463 988968 You know what they call a Quarter<br />Pounder with Cheese in France?
989093 991095 No. Tell 'em, Vincent.
991220 995224 <i>A Royale</i> with Cheese.<br />A <i>Royale</i> with Cheese.
995308 998769 You know why they call it that?
998853 1001939 Uh, because of the metric system?
1002982 1006276 Check out the big brain on Brett!

2299870 2302414 [INHALES] Just over three years.
2304917 2307753 I go there about once a<br />year to chill out for a month.
2307837 2311549 No kiddin'? I didn't know that.

2314636 2317597 ["ACE OF SPADES"]
2319265 2321226 I heard you did a pilot.
2322435 2326147 -That was my 15 minutes.<br />-What was it?
2326231 2330901 It was a show about a team of female<br />secret agents called <i>Fox Force Five.</i>
2330985 2333696 -What?<br /><i>-Fox Force Five.</i>
2333780 2336031 Fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks.
2336115 2338576 Force, as in we're a<br />force to be reckoned with.
2338660 2341412 And five, as in there's<br />one-two-three-four-five of us.
2341496 2345207 There was a blond one, Sommerset O'Neal.<br />She was the leader.
2345291 2348377 The Japanese fox was a kung fu master.
2348461 2352548 The black girl was a demolition expert.
2352632 2355467 French Fox's specialty was sex.
2355551 2359847 -What was your specialty?<br />-Knives.
2359931 2362016 The character I played, Raven McCoy,
2362100 2365936 her background was she grew<br />up raised by circus performers.
2366020 2370274 According to the show, she was the<br />deadliest woman in the world with a knife.
2370358 2373110 And she knew a zillion old jokes.
2373194 2377323 Her grandfather, an old<br />vaudevillian, taught her.
2377407 2380701 And if we would have got picked up,<br />they would've worked in a gimmick…
2380785 2384664 Where every show I<br />would've told another joke.
2385832 2388626 You know any of them old jokes?
2388710 2392421 Well, I only got the chance to say<br />one 'cause we only did one show.
2392505 2395049 -Tell me.<br />-It's corny.
2395967 2398011 Don't be that way. Tell me.
2398136 2401805 No, you wouldn't like it, and I'd<br />be embarrassed. You'd be embarr…

2622695 2626115 -Pretty smart.<br />-Yeah. I got my moments.
2626199 2630578 -So did you think of somethin' to say?<br />-Actually, I did.
2632205 2634165 However…
2635875 2638878 You seem like a really<br />nice person, and I…
2638962 2641797 I don't want to offend you. Oooh.
2641881 2644606 This doesn't sound<br />like the usual, mindless,
2644690 2647052 boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.
2647136 2650139 This sounds like you<br />actually have somethin' to say.
2650223 2652976 Well, well, I do. I do.
2653101 2657146 [INHALES] But you have to<br />promise not to be offended. No, no.
2657272 2661484 You can't promise somethin' like that.<br />I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.
2661568 2663876 You can ask me what<br />you're gonna ask me, and
2663960 2666405 my natural response<br />could be to get offended.
2666489 2668866 Then through no fault of my own,<br />I would have broken my promise.
2668950 2671619 Let's just forget it.<br />That's an impossibility.
2671703 2675748 Trying to forget anything as intriguing<br />as this would be an exercise in futility.
2675832 2678001 Is that a fact? And besides,
2678126 2683130 isn't it more, uh, exciting when you don't<br />have permission? All right, all right.
2683214 2686008 Well, here goes.
2686092 2689094 What did you think about<br />what happened to Antwan?
2689178 2692598 -Who's Antwan?<br />-Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.
2692682 2695893 -He fell out of a window.<br />-Hmm. Hmm.
2695977 2698304 Well, that is one way to say it.<br />Another way
2698388 2700689 to say it would be<br />that he was thrown out.
2700773 2703901 Another way would be he<br />was thrown out by Marsellus.
2703985 2706495 Yet, even another way<br />is to say he was thrown
2706579 2709114 out of a window by<br />Marsellus because of you.
2709198 2711617 Is that a fact? No.
2711701 2714828 No, it's not a fact. It's just what<br />I heard. That's just what I heard.
2714912 2717790 Who told you? They.
2717874 2720334 "They" talk a lot, don't they?
2720418 2722419 [CHUCKLES]
2722503 2725172 They certainly do. They certainly do.
2725256 2728347 Don't be shy, Vincent.<br />What else did "they" say?
2728431 2729636 I'm… I'm not shy.
2729720 2732264 -Um…<br />-Did it involve the "F" word?
2732348 2736352 No, no, no, no, no. They just said that<br />Antwan had given you a foot massage.
2737853 2740480 -And?<br />-And… And nothin'.
2740564 2743441 That's it.
2743525 2745569 You heard Marsellus…
2745653 2747955 Threw Tony Rocky<br />Horror out of a fourth-story
2748039 2749948 window for giving me a foot massage?
2750074 2751992 Mm-hmm. And you believe that?
2752076 2756621 [CHUCKLES] Well, at the time I<br />was told it sounded reasonable.
2756705 2759791 Marsellus throwing Tony<br />out of a fourth-story window…
2759875 2762919 For massaging my feet seemed reasonable?
2763003 2766464 No, it seemed excessive, but<br />that doesn't mean it didn't happen.
2766548 2769175 I understand that Marsellus<br />is very protective of you.
2769259 2773888 A husband being protective<br />of his wife is one thing.
2773972 2775677 A husband almost killing another man for
2775761 2777684 touching his wife's<br />feet is something else.
2777768 2780312 But did it happen?
2780437 2786276 Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was<br />my hand when he shook it… at my wedding.
2786360 2788737 Really?
2788821 2792157 Truth is, nobody knows why<br />Marsellus threw Tony out that window…
2792241 2794159 Except Marsellus and Tony.

3847970 3850890 He was in the POW camp with Daddy.
3856228 3858146 Hello, little man.
3858230 3862317 Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.
3862401 3865612 See, I was a good friend of your dad's.
3865696 3868740 We were in that Hanoi<br />pit of hell together…
3868824 3871243 Over five years.
3871327 3873245 Hopefully…
3873329 3876248 You'll never have to<br />experience this yourself,
3876332 3879751 but when two men are in a<br />situation like me and your dad were…
3879835 3882629 For as long as we were,
3882713 3887008 you take on certain<br />responsibilities of the other.
3887092 3889011 If it'd been me who'd…
3890346 3892264 Not made it,
3892348 3896643 Major Coolidge'd be talking<br />right now to my son Jim.
3896727 3900356 But the way it turned<br />out, I'm talking to you.
3901774 3903692 Butch…
3905277 3907196 I got something for ya.
3913702 3915787 This watch I got here…
3915871 3917570 Was first purchased by your
3917654 3920625 great-grandfather during<br />the First World War.
3920709 3925380 It was bought in a little general<br />store in Knoxville, Tennessee.
3925464 3929009 Made by the first company<br />to ever make wristwatches.
3929093 3932012 Up till then, people just<br />carried pocket watches.
3932096 3935265 It was bought by Private<br />Doughboy Erine Coolidge…
3935349 3938268 On the day he set sail for Paris.
3938352 3940771 This was your<br />great-grandfather's war watch,
3940855 3944191 and he wore it every day<br />he was in that war, and…
3944275 3947819 When he'd done his duty, he went<br />home to your great-grandmother,
3947903 3952324 took the watch off, put it in an old<br />coffee can, and in that can it stayed…
3952408 3956828 Until your grandad, Dane Coolidge,<br />was called upon by his country…
3956912 3960624 To go overseas and fight<br />the Germans once again.
3960708 3964169 This time they called it World War II.
3964253 3969216 Your great-grandfather gave this<br />watch to your grandad for good luck.
3969300 3972302 Unfortunately, Dane's luck<br />wasn't as good as his old man's.
3972386 3975305 Dane was a Marine, and he was killed,
3975389 3979392 along with all the other Marines<br />at the battle of Wake Island.
3979476 3982395 Your grandad was facing death.
3982479 3984398 He knew it.
3984482 3988402 None of those boys had any illusions<br />about ever leaving that island alive,
3988486 3991697 so three days before the<br />Japanese took the island,
3991781 3996994 your grandad asked a gunner on an<br />Air Force transport, name of Winocki…
3997078 3999997 A man he'd never met before in his life…
4000081 4003042 To deliver to his infant son,
4003126 4007713 who he'd never seen in<br />the flesh, his gold watch.
4007797 4012134 Three days later, your grandad<br />was dead, but Winocki kept his word.
4012218 4016430 After the war was over, he<br />paid a visit to your grandmother,
4016514 4020768 delivering to your infant<br />father his dad's gold watch.
4020852 4022771 This watch.
4028652 4034073 This watch was on your daddy's wrist<br />when he was shot down over Hanoi.
4034157 4037577 He was captured, put in a<br />Vietnamese prison camp.
4037661 4041706 He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch,
4041790 4045293 it'd be confiscated, taken away.
4045377 4049088 The way your dad looked at it,<br />this watch was your birthright.
4049172 4051049 He'd be damned if any<br />slope's gonna put their
4051133 4053092 greasy, yellow hands<br />on his boy's birthright,
4053176 4057096 so he hid it in one place he knew<br />he could hide something… his ass.
4057180 4060600 Five long years he wore<br />this watch up his ass.
4060684 4064854 Then he died of dysentery…<br />He give me the watch.
4064938 4068774 I hid this uncomfortable hunk<br />of metal up my ass two years.
4068858 4070776 Then…
4070860 4074947 After seven years, I was<br />sent home to my family and…
4075031 4076950 Now…
4079369 4082330 little man, I give the watch to you.

4279613 4282073 You killed the other boxing man.
4285702 4287787 He's dead?
4287871 4290290 The radio said he was dead.
4293084 4295295 Sorry about that, Floyd.
4296588 4299090 What does it feel like?
4299174 4301092 What does what feel like?
4301176 4303094 Killing a man.
4304888 4308933 Beating another man to<br />death with your bare hands.

4311019 4312937 No.
4313021 4317942 It is a subject I have much interest in.
4318026 4321947 You are the first person I have<br />ever met who has killed somebody.

4385552 4387804 what is it you want to know?
4387929 4392809 I want to know what it feels<br />like to kill a man. I couldn't tell ya.
4398690 4403110 I didn't know he was dead<br />till you told me he was dead.
4403194 4407783 Now that I know he's dead, you<br />wanna know how I feel about it?
4411537 4414957 I don't feel the least bit bad about it.
4425968 4428345 What the fuck'd I tell ya? Huh?
4428429 4432349 As soon as the word got out the fix was<br />in, man, the odds went through the roof.
4432433 4434643 I know. I know. Unbelievable.
4434727 4438146 Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was<br />a better boxer, he'd still be alive.
4438230 4440148 If he never laced up his gloves,
4440232 4442651 which he never shoulda done in the<br />first fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

4444737 4448323 Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?<br />It's over now.
4448407 4451326 Yeah, well, enough about<br />the poor, unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

4458167 4460586 All eight? How long to collect?
4462254 4465173 So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?<br />No, I understand.
4465257 4468385 A few stragglers aside.<br />Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.
4468469 4470679 That is great news, man.
4470763 4474975 Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and<br />Fabienne are gonna leave in the morning.
4475059 4478312 It'll probably take us a couple<br />days to get down to Knoxville.
4478396 4480314 Okay, my brother.
4480398 4482357 [LAUGHING] You're right.
4482441 4484735 You're goddamn right.

4513931 4517184 here's a little something for the effort.<br />Now…
4517268 4521229 If anybody asks you who your fare<br />was tonight, what are you gonna say?
4521313 4523231 The truth.

4563899 4566067 Poor baby.
4566151 4568694 Can you make spoons?
4568778 4571656 You know what?<br />I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.
4571781 4575701 I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.<br />I like the way you stink.
4575785 4578205 Let me take this jacket off.
4580373 4583918 I was looking at myself in the mirror.<br />Uh-huh.
4584002 4585921 I wish I had a pot.
4587714 4591634 You were looking at yourself in the<br />mirror and you wish you had some pot?
4591718 4594637 A pot. [GIGGLES] A pot belly.
4594721 4596848 Pot bellies are sexy.
4596932 4599225 Well, you should be happy… [GRUNTS]
4599309 4601227 'Cause you have one.
4601311 4604772 Shut up, fatso. I don't have a pot.
4604856 4608693 I have a bit of a tummy, like<br />Madonna when she did "Lucky Star."
4608777 4610695 It's not the same thing.
4610779 4614699 I didn't know there was such a difference<br />between a pot belly and a tummy.
4614783 4616701 The difference is huge.
4616785 4620204 [KISSING] Would you<br />like it if I had a pot belly?
4620288 4622206 No.
4622290 4626711 Pot bellies make a man look<br />either oafish or like a gorilla.
4626795 4629881 But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy.
4629965 4635386 The rest of you is normal… normal face,<br />normal legs, normal hips, normal ass…
4635470 4639515 But with a big,<br />perfectly round pot belly.
4639599 4642518 If I had one, I'd wear a<br />T-shirt two sizes too small…
4642602 4644520 To accentuate it.
4644604 4647023 You think men would find that attractive?
4647107 4650276 I don't give a damn<br />what men find attractive.
4650360 4653821 It's unfortunate what we find pleasing<br />to the touch and pleasing to the eye…
4653905 4655824 Is seldom the same.
4657117 4659160 [SIGHS]
4659244 4662789 If you had a pot belly,<br />I would punch you in it.
4662914 4665833 You'd punch me in the belly?<br />Right in the belly.
4665917 4667794 Ohh! I'd smother you!
4667919 4671839 I'd drop it right on your face till<br />you couldn't breathe! [LAUGHING]
4671923 4673841 You'd do that? Yeah.

6641447 6644409 Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!<br />Get on!
6646077 6648334 Oh, baby, I'm sorry.<br />Come here, come here.
6648418 6649497 [WEEPING QUIETLY]
6649581 6651457 I'm sorry. Mmm.
6651583 6655503 I'm so sorry. You were gone so long,<br />I started to think dreadful thoughts.
6655587 6658506 I didn't mean to worry you.<br />Everything's fine.
6658590 6660508 How was your breakfast? It was good.
6660592 6662510 Did you get the blueberry pancakes?
6662594 6666514 They didn't have blueberry; I had to<br />get buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?
6666598 6669517 Since I left you, this has<br />been, without a doubt,
6669601 6672811 the single weirdest fuckin' day<br />of my life… I'll tell you all about it.
6672895 6674688 Gotta go. Come on.
6674772 6677525 Butch, whose motorcycle is this?
6677650 6680236 It's a chopper, baby.<br />Whose chopper is this?
6680320 6682238 Zed's. Who's Zed?
6682322 6684865 Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.

6701049 6703342 JULES: Yes, you did, Brett!
6703426 6706888 You tried to fuck him, and Marsellus<br />Wallace don't liked to be fucked…
6707013 6709390 By anybody except Mrs. Wallace. [PANTING]
6709515 6712601 Oh, God, please, I don't wanna die.<br />You read the Bible, Brett?
6712685 6713498 [WHIMPERING]
6713582 6716105 Yes! Well, there's this<br />passage I got memorized.
6716189 6718357 Sorta fits the occasion.
6718441 6721735 Ezekiel 25:17.
6721819 6726115 "The path of the righteous<br />man is beset on all sides…
6726199 6728117 "By the inequities of the selfish…"

6739545 6742047 "for he is truly his brother's keeper…"
6742131 6744842 "And the finder of lost children."
6744926 6749179 "And I will strike down upon<br />thee with great vengeance…"
6749263 6751432 "And furious anger…"
6751516 6755894 "Those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy my brothers."

6773913 6776832 VINCENT: Is he a friend of yours?<br />Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.
6776916 6779794 JULES: Hmm? Oh.<br />Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.
6779919 6782839 Better tell him to shut up. He's<br />gettin' on my nerves. Fuck. [MUTTERING]
6782923 6786092 Marvin. Marvin!<br />I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

6818500 6821920 Why the fuck didn't you tell us<br />somebody was in the bathroom?
6822004 6824881 Slip your mind?<br />Did you forget that someone was in there…
6824965 6826841 With a goddamn hand cannon?
6826925 6830888 You see the size of that gun he<br />fired at us? It was bigger than him.
6835642 6838353 We should be fuckin' dead, man.
6838437 6840355 I know. We was lucky.
6840439 6843525 No, no, no, no. That shit wasn't luck.
6843609 6847821 -Yeah, maybe.<br />-This was divine intervention.
6847905 6849823 You know what divine intervention is?
6855704 6857622 I think so.
6857706 6861126 That means that God came down<br />from heaven and stopped the bullets.
6861210 6863628 That's right.<br />That's exactly what it means.
6863712 6866962 God came down from heaven and<br />stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.
6867925 6869884 I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.
6869968 6872345 Don't do that.<br />Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!
6872429 6874881 What just happened<br />here was a fuckin' miracle!
6874965 6876391 Chill. This shit happens.
6876475 6879227 Wrong! Wrong.<br />This shit <i>doesn't</i> "just happen."
6879311 6882731 Do you want to continue this<br />theological discussion in a car…
6882815 6885275 Or in a jailhouse with the cops?
6885359 6887944 We should be fuckin' dead, my friend!
6888028 6892240 What happened here was a miracle,<br />and I want you to fucking acknowledge it!
6892324 6897037 All right, it was a miracle.<br />Can we go now?
6904044 6907422 Let's go, nigga! Come on! Shit.
6909174 6911134 VINCENT: You ever seen that show <i>Cops?</i>
6911218 6914137 I was watching it one time<br />and there was this cop on,
6914221 6918141 and he was talkin' about this gunfight he<br />had in the hallway with this guy, right?
6918225 6921645 He just unloaded on this guy and<br />nothin' happened. He didn't hit nothin'.
6921729 6924648 Okay? It was just him and this guy.
6924732 6928068 I mean, you know, it's-it's<br />freaky, but it happens.
6928152 6930365 You wanna play blind<br />man, go walk with the
6930449 6933073 shepherd, but me, my<br />eyes are wide fuckin' open.
6933157 6936076 -What the fuck does that mean?<br />-It means that's it for me.
6936160 6938788 From here on in, you can<br />consider my ass retired.
6938913 6941081 Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.<br />Don't blaspheme.
6941165 6942125 I said, don't do that!
6942209 6944210 Hey, why are you<br />fuckin' freakin' out on us?
6944294 6947338 Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today…<br />I'm through.
6947422 6949313 Why don't you tell him<br />at the same time why?
6949397 6950341 Don't worry, I will.
6950425 6952672 And I bet you $10,000<br />he laughs his ass off.
6952756 6954428 I don't give a damn if he does.
6954512 6957598 [SIGHS] Marvin, what<br />do you make of all this?
6957682 6960100 Man, I don't <i>even</i> have an opinion.
6960184 6964396 You gotta have an opinion. You think<br />God came down from heaven and stopped
6964480 6966441 -[GUNSHOT]<br />-What the fuck's happenin'?
6966566 6968443 Aw, shit, man! Aw, man!
6968568 6971487 Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.<br />Why the fuck'd you do that?
6971571 6973448 I didn't mean it. It was an accident.
6973573 6976492 Man, I seen some crazy-ass shit<br />in my time, but this… Chill out, man!
6976576 6979495 It was an accident.<br />We probably went over a bump or somethin'.
6979579 6981497 The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump.
6981581 6984875 I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch.<br />The gun went off.
6984959 6988379 Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on<br />a city street in broad daylight here!
6988463 6991382 I don't believe it!<br />Well, believe it now, motherfucker!
6991466 6994927 We gotta get this car off the road. Cops<br />notice shit like a car drenched in blood.
6995011 6997930 Just take it to a friendly place,<br />that's all! This is the Valley, Vincent.
6998014 7000432 Marsellus ain't got no<br />friendly places in the Valley.
7000516 7003394 Well, Jules, this ain't my<br />fuckin' town, man! Shit!
7003519 7006397 What you doing?<br />I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.
7006522 7010067 Where's Toluca Lake?<br />Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.
7010151 7013070 If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't<br />know what the fuck we gonna do,
7013154 7016073 'cause I ain't got no<br />other partners in 818.
7016157 7019076 Jimmie, how you doin', man?<br />It's Jules. Just listen up, man.
7019160 7023080 Me and my homeboy are in a car,<br />and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.
7023164 7025364 I need to use your<br />garage for a couple hours.
7026834 7029753 We gotta be real fuckin'<br />delicate with this Jimmie situation.
7029837 7033424 He's one remark away from<br />kickin' our asses out the door.
7033549 7036468 If he does, what do we do? We<br />ain't leavin' till we make a couple calls,
7036552 7039471 but I don't want it to reach that pitch…<br />Jimmie's a friend.
7039555 7042474 You don't come into your friend's<br />house and start tellin' him what's what.
7042558 7044476 Just tell him not to be abusive.
7044560 7046478 He kinda freaked out back<br />there when he saw Marvin.
7046562 7049732 Put yourself in his position…<br />It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.
7049816 7051734 He wasn't expectin' this shit.
7051818 7054737 We gotta remember here<br />who's doin' who a favor.
7054821 7058741 If that favor means I gotta take shit, he<br />can stick that favor straight up his ass.
7058825 7062746 Fuck, nigga, what the fuck'd you just do<br />to his towel, man? I was dryin' my hands!
7062830 7065730 You're supposed to wash 'em first!<br />You watched me wash 'em.
7065833 7069377 I watched you get 'em wet. I was<br />washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.
7069461 7071379 Maybe if he'd had Lava I<br />coulda done a better job.
7071463 7073381 I used the same fuckin' soap you did,
7073465 7076384 and when I finished, the towel<br />didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!
7076468 7079387 What if he was to come in<br />here and see his towel like this?
7079471 7083558 It's shit like this that's gonna<br />bring this situation to a head, man!
7083642 7087062 Look, I ain't threatenin'<br />you or nothin', all right?
7087146 7091608 You know I respect you and all. But just<br />don't put me in this position, all right?
7091692 7094361 All right. Fine. Fine.
7094445 7097364 Ask me nice like that, no problem.
7097448 7100409 Just go handle your friend.<br />Go ahead. I don't care.
7102119 7104996 Mmm! Goddamn, Jimmie!
7105080 7107123 This some serious gourmet shit.
7107207 7109167 Me and Vincent would've been satisfied…
7109251 7111169 With some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.
7111253 7113171 Right? [CHUCKLES]
7113255 7116174 And he springs this<br />serious gourmet shit on us.
7116258 7118301 -What flavor is this?<br />-Knock it off, Julie.
7118385 7118724 What?
7118808 7122430 I don't need you to tell me<br />how fuckin' good my coffee is.
7122514 7125016 I'm the one who buys it.<br />I know how good it is.
7125100 7126977 When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.
7127061 7130689 I buy the gourmet expensive stuff<br />'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
7130773 7134693 But you know what's on my mind right now?<br />It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.
7134777 7136945 It's the dead nigger in my garage.
7137029 7137991 Jimmie, don't even worry…
7138075 7140448 -Don't tell me about anything.<br />I wanna ask you a question.
7140532 7142450 When you came pulling in here,
7142534 7145704 did you notice the sign on the front of<br />my house that said, "Dead nigger storage"?
7145788 7146888 You know I ain't seen no…
7146972 7149207 Did you notice the sign<br />on the front of my house…
7149291 7151209 That said, "Dead nigger storage"?
7151293 7154004 No. I didn't.
7154129 7157007 You know why you didn't see that sign?<br />[SIGHS] Why?
7157091 7159177 'Cause it ain't there,<br />'cause storing dead
7159261 7161636 niggers ain't my fuckin'<br />business, that's why!
7161720 7164639 -We're not gonna store the motherfucker…<br />-Don't you fuckin' realize…
7164723 7166850 That if Bonnie comes<br />home and finds a dead
7166934 7169144 body in her house,<br />I'm gonna get divorced?
7169228 7170489 No marriage counselor. No trial
7170573 7172439 separation.<br />I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.
7172523 7175859 Okay?<br />And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced!
7175943 7180947 Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,<br />but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.
7181031 7183116 Jimmie, Jimmie, she<br />ain't gonna leave you.
7183200 7187120 Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!<br />Okay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.
7187204 7189218 There's nothin' you're<br />gonna say that's gonna
7189302 7191302 make me forget I love my wife. Is there?
7194294 7198965 Now, look, you know, she comes home<br />from work in about an hour and a half.
7199049 7201677 The graveyard shift at the hospital.
7201761 7205264 You gotta make some phone calls?<br />You gotta call some people?
7205348 7209268 Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck<br />out of my house before she gets here.
7209352 7212271 That's Kool & the Gang.<br />We don't wanna fuck your shit up.
7212355 7215274 All I wanna do is call my<br />people and get 'em to bring us in.
7215358 7218277 You're fucking my shit up right now!
7218361 7221447 You're gonna fuck my shit up<br />big time if Bonnie comes home.
7221531 7225034 Do me that favor, all right? The phone is<br />in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.
7225118 7228037 Well, say she comes home.
7228121 7230540 What do you think she'll do?
7232041 7234460 Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.
7234544 7236754 That ain't no kinda answer.
7236838 7239882 I mean, you know, I don't.<br />How much? A lot or a little?
7239966 7242802 You got to appreciate<br />what an explosive element…

7350452 7354039 It sure is. I'm Winston Wolf.<br />I solve problems.
7354164 7357083 Good. We got one.<br />So I heard. May I come in?
7357167 7359044 Uh, yeah. Please do.
7359128 7362797 You must be Jules.<br />Which would make you… Vincent.
7362881 7365300 Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.
7365384 7368303 If I was informed correctly, the<br />clock is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?
7368387 7370264 Uh, one hundred percent.
7370389 7374309 Your wife Bonnie comes home at<br />9:30 in the a.m., correct? Uh-huh.
7374393 7376415 I was led to believe if<br />she comes home and
7376499 7378856 finds us here, she<br />wouldn't appreciate it much.
7378981 7383235 She wouldn't at that. That gives us<br />40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge,

7400919 7404298 Do me a favor, will ya?<br />Thought I smelled some coffee back there.
7404423 7407885 Would you make me a cup? Uh, yeah, sure.
7409345 7412264 Oh, uh, um, how do you take it?
7412348 7414892 Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
7416977 7420397 About the car, is there anything<br />I need to know? Does it stall?
7420481 7423859 Does it smoke? Does it make<br />a lot of noise? Is there gas in it?
7423984 7427404 Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.<br />Positive?
7427488 7430866 Don't get me on the road and I<br />find out the brake lights don't work.
7430991 7435036 As far as I know, the<br />motherfucker's tip-top. Good enough.

7450594 7452513 Mmm.
7453597 7455682 Okay, first thing. You two.
7455766 7458685 Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
7458769 7461438 This looks to be a pretty<br />domesticated house.

7465609 7469029 Good. What I need you two fellas to<br />do is take those cleaning products…
7469113 7473116 And clean the inside of the car…<br />I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.
7473200 7477120 Go in the back seat, scoop up all<br />those little pieces of brain and skull.
7477204 7480124 Get it out of there.<br />Wipe down the upholstery.
7480208 7483127 It don't need to be spick-and-span.<br />You don't need to eat off it.
7483211 7485321 Just give it a good once-over.<br />What you need
7485405 7487548 to take care of are<br />the really messy parts.
7487632 7491719 The pools of blood that have<br />collected, you gotta soak that shit up.
7491803 7494221 We need to raid your linen closet.
7494305 7497224 I need blankets, I need<br />comforters, quilts, bedspreads.
7497308 7500936 The thicker the better, the darker<br />the better. No whites. Can't use 'em.
7501020 7506317 We'll need to camouflage the front<br />seat and back seat and floorboards…
7506401 7508319 With quilts and blankets,
7508403 7512323 so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout<br />in the car, the subterfuge won't last,
7512407 7515242 but at a glance the car<br />will appear to be normal.
7515326 7517370 Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work.
7517454 7519205 "Please" would be nice.
7520665 7523668 -Come again?<br />-I said, a "please" would be nice.
7525503 7527266 Get it straight, buster. I'm not here to
7527350 7529500 say please.<br />I'm here to tell you what to do.
7531176 7534095 And if self-preservation<br />is an instinct you possess,
7534179 7536597 you'd better fuckin'<br />do it and do it quick.
7536681 7540559 I'm here to help. If my help's not<br />appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.
7540643 7543938 No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;<br />your help is definitely appreciated.
7544022 7546941 Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean<br />disrespect, okay? I respect you.
7547025 7549860 I just don't like people<br />barkin' orders at me.
7549944 7552947 If I'm curt with you, it's<br />because time is a factor.
7553031 7555128 I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you
7555212 7557660 guys to act fast if you<br />wanna get out of this.
7557744 7561206 So pretty please, with sugar<br />on top, clean the fuckin' car.
7565710 7569380 Don't be lookin' at me like that,<br />all right? I can feel your look.
7572091 7574760 It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
7574844 7576762 [SIPPING]
7576846 7578765 Green.
7580391 7583311 Nothin' except for the mess inside.
7585522 7587941 Mmm, about 20 minutes.
7589442 7591402 Nobody who'll be missed.
7593446 7596407 You're a good man, Joe. Thanks a bunch.
7597492 7599410 How we comin', Jimmie? Pretty good.
7599494 7602622 I got it all here, but, uh, [SIGHS]
7602747 7606167 Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.<br />Winston, Jimmie, Winston.
7606251 7609753 Okay. You gotta understand<br />something, uh, Winston.
7609837 7611755 Uh… Uh, no, thank you.
7611839 7614967 Uh, this is our best linen here,
7615051 7617970 and it's, uh… it was a wedding present…
7618054 7620432 From my uncle Conrad and my aunt Ginny.
7620558 7624978 They're not with us anymore.<br />I wanna help… Let me ask you a question.
7625062 7627982 If you don't mind.<br />No, no, please. Go ahead.
7629567 7634446 Your uncle Conrad and Aunt<br />Ginny, were they millionaires?
7635614 7637532 No.
7637616 7640035 Well, your uncle Marsellus is.
7640119 7643497 And I'm positive that if<br />Uncle Conrad and Aunt…
7643622 7646041 Ginny. Ginny were here,
7646125 7650378 they would furnish you<br />with a whole bedroom set,
7650462 7653632 which your uncle Marsellus<br />is more than happy to do.
7657595 7661515 I like oak myself.<br />That's what I have in my bedroom.
7662641 7664602 How about you, Jimmie?
7665811 7667771 You an oak man?
7668856 7670816 Oak's nice.
7676655 7680492 Oh, man, I will never<br />forgive your ass for this shit.
7680576 7682994 This is some fucked-up, repugnant shit.
7683078 7686498 Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy<br />that once a man admits that he is wrong,
7686582 7689501 that he is immediately<br />forgiven for all wrongdoings?
7689585 7692504 Get the fuck out my face with that shit!
7692588 7693901 The motherfucker<br />that said that shit never
7693985 7695423 had to pick up<br />itty-bitty pieces of skull…
7695507 7697032 On account of your dumb ass. I got a
7697116 7699261 threshold, Jules, for<br />the abuse that I will take.
7699345 7702931 Right now, I'm a fuckin' race<br />car, and you got me in the red.
7703015 7706434 I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous<br />to have a race car in the fuckin' red.
7706518 7708395 That's all. I could blow.
7708520 7710438 Oh, you ready to blow? Yeah.
7710522 7713441 Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'<br />motherfucker, motherfucker.
7713525 7716444 Every time my fingers<br />touch brain, I'm Superfly TNT.
7716528 7718446 I'm the Guns of the Navarone.
7718530 7721449 In fact, what the fuck<br />am I doin' in the back?
7721533 7724786 You're the motherfucker should be<br />on brain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'!
7724870 7727770 I'm washin' windows, you're<br />pickin' up this nigga's skull!
7737049 7739009 Fine job, gentlemen.
7740344 7742762 You may get out of this yet.
7742846 7745265 I can't believe this is the same car.
7745349 7748768 Well, let's not start suckin'<br />each other's dicks quite yet.
7748852 7752272 Phase one is complete… clean the car…<br />which moves us right along to phase two:
7752356 7754274 clean you two.
7755859 7757695 Strip.
7757820 7761574 -All the way?<br />-WOLF: To your bare ass.
7761658 7764702 Quickly, gentlemen.<br />We got about 15 minutes…
7764786 7767705 Before Jimmie's better half<br />comes pulling into the driveway.
7767789 7770291 Goddamn, this morning<br />air is some chilly shit.
7770375 7772293 Are you sure this is<br />absolutely necessary?
7772377 7774795 -You know what you two look like?<br />-VINCENT: What?
7774879 7778299 Like a couple of guys who<br />just blew off somebody's head.
7778383 7781761 Strippin' off those bloody<br />rags is absolutely necessary.
7786057 7788517 Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.
7788601 7790651 Don't do nothin'<br />stupid, like leavin' this
7790735 7793022 shit out front for the<br />garbageman to pick up.
7793106 7797318 Don't worry, we're taking it with us.<br />Jim, the soap.
7798778 7800696 -Vincent.<br />-WOLF: Okay, gentlemen.
7800780 7804242 You both been to county before, I'm sure.<br />Here it comes.
7804367 7807244 Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!<br />Yo! Yo! Yo!
7807328 7810498 Better you than me, gentlemen.<br />[CHUCKLING]
7810623 7812542 Don't be afraid of the soap.<br />Spread it around.
7812626 7813542 [YELLING CONTINUES]
7813626 7815366 Get 'em there a little bit.<br />Vincent's hair.
7815450 7816504 Hey, get out of my hair!
7816588 7819466 -Come on, do it, goddamn it! Do it!<br />-Uh, um…
7820550 7822469 Towel.
7832979 7836148 WOLF: You're dry enough.<br />Toss 'em their clothes.
7836232 7839527 WOLF [LAUGHING]: Perfect.
7839611 7843030 Perfect.<br />We couldn't have planned this better.
7843114 7845032 You guys look like…
7845116 7847494 What do they look like, Jimmie?
7847619 7851205 Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.<br />[LAUGHING]
7851289 7852851 -[BOTH LAUGHING]<br />-Ha-ha-ha.
7852935 7854792 They're your clothes, motherfucker.
7854876 7857586 Come on, gentlemen.<br />We're laughing our way right into prison.
7857670 7859631 Don't make me beg.
7862675 7866095 Okay, gentlemen, let's get<br />our rules of the road straight.
7866179 7869724 We're going to a place called<br />Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.
7869808 7872727 Monster Joe and his daughter<br />Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma.
7872811 7874687 The place is North Hollywood,
7874771 7878774 so a few twists and turns aside,<br />we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.
7878858 7882195 Now, I'll drive the tainted car.<br />Jules, you ride with me.
7883571 7885531 Vincent, you follow in my Acura.
7885615 7889452 Now, if we come across<br />the path of any John Q. Laws,
7889577 7892664 nobody does a fuckin' thing<br />till I do something. Right.
7892789 7895625 What did I say? Don't do shit unless.
7895750 7898043 Unless what? Unless you do it first.
7898127 7900505 Spoken like a true prodigy.
7900589 7904009 How about you, Lash LaRue? Can you keep<br />your spurs from jingling and jangling?
7904093 7908221 The gun went off. I don't know why.<br />I'm cool, I promise you.
7908305 7911224 Fair enough. Now, I drive<br />real fuckin' fast, so keep up.
7911308 7913810 If I get my car back any<br />different than I gave it,
7913894 7916772 Monster Joe's gonna be<br />disposing of two bodies.
7916856 7920567 -[METAL DOOR SLAMMING]<br />-[ENGINE IDLING]
7920651 7922361 Outta my way, Rex.
7923904 7926323 -We cool?<br />-Like it never happened.
7926407 7930160 -VINCENT: All right.<br />-Boys, this is Raquel.
7930244 7932871 Someday all this will be hers.
7932955 7935749 Hi. So, what's with the outfits?
7935875 7938397 You guys going to a<br />volleyball game or something?
7938481 7939294 [WOLF LAUGHS]
7939378 7941838 I'm takin' milady out to breakfast.
7941922 7944592 Maybe I could drop you two off.<br />Where do you live?
7944717 7946092 Redondo. Inglewood.
7946176 7949596 It's… It's your future. I…
7949680 7952432 I see a… a cab ride.
7952516 7955477 Move outta the sticks, fellas.<br />Say good night, Raquel.
7955561 7958480 Good night, Raquel.<br />I'll see you guys around.
7958564 7960982 Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.
7961066 7964986 Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it<br />was a real pleasure watching you work.
7965070 7967989 Yeah, really.<br />And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.
7968073 7969992 Call me Winston.
7971577 7974455 -You see that, young lady? Respect.<br />-[ALARM DEACTIVATES]
7974580 7978709 Respect for one's elders shows character.<br />I have character.
7978834 7982838 Because you <i>are</i> a character doesn't<br />mean that you <i>have</i> character. [CHUCKLES]
7989428 7992348 -[TIRES SCREECHING]<br />-Wanna share a cab?
7992473 7994328 I'd go for some breakfast. Feel like
7994412 7996726 -havin' breakfast with me?<br />-[PHONE DIALING]
7996810 7999480 Cool.
8003609 8006709 I don't know why, I just thought<br />he'd be European or something.
8006820 8010220 Yeah, he's about as European as<br />fuckin' English Bob. I know that now.
8010324 8012742 But was he cool or what? Thank you.
8012826 8015245 Totally fuckin' cool, in control.
8015329 8019333 Didn't even really get pissed when<br />you were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.
8019458 8022043 [CHUCKLES] Want some bacon?
8022127 8024004 No, man, I don't eat pork.
8024129 8027549 Are you Jewish? I ain't Jewish; I<br />just don't dig on swine, that's all.
8027633 8030552 Why not? Pigs are filthy animals.
8030636 8032554 I don't eat filthy animals.
8032638 8036057 Yeah, but bacon tastes good.<br />Pork chops taste good.
8036141 8039061 Sewer rat may taste like<br />pumpkin pie, but I'd never know…
8039145 8042064 'Cause I wouldn't eat<br />the filthy motherfuckers.
8042148 8045067 Pigs sleep and root in shit.<br />That's a filthy animal.
8045151 8049030 I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense<br />enough to disregard its own feces.
8049155 8053451 How about a dog? Dog eats its own feces.<br />I don't eat dog either.
8053535 8056871 Yeah, but do you consider<br />a dog to be a filthy animal?
8056955 8059874 I wouldn't go so far<br />as to call a dog filthy,
8059958 8061835 but they're definitely dirty.
8061960 8063866 But a dog's got personality. Personality
8063950 8066088 goes a long way.<br />Ah, so, by that rationale,
8066172 8069717 if a pig had a better personality,<br />he would cease to be a filthy animal.
8069801 8073721 Is that true? We'd have to be talkin'<br />about one charming motherfuckin' pig.
8073805 8077808 I mean, he'd have to be ten times more<br />charming than that Arnold on <i>Green Acres.</i>
8077892 8080937 [BOTH LAUGHING]
8083440 8085566 Oh, man, that's good.
8085650 8089236 That's good, man.<br />You're startin' to lighten up.
8089320 8092240 You've been sittin'<br />there, all serious and shit.
8092365 8094825 I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.<br />About what?
8094909 8097828 -About the miracle we witnessed.<br />-Miracle you witnessed.
8097912 8101124 -I witnessed a freak occurrence.<br />-What is a miracle, Vincent?
8103084 8106254 Act of God. And what's an act of God?
8109758 8113595 When, um, God makes<br />the impossible possible.
8114596 8116473 But this morning…
8116598 8119308 I don't think qualifies. Hey, Vincent.
8119392 8123104 See, that shit don't matter.<br />You're judging this shit the wrong way.
8123188 8128109 It could be God stopped the bullets,<br />changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.
8128193 8131153 You don't judge shit<br />like this based on merit.
8131237 8133698 Now, whether or not what we experienced…
8133782 8136909 Was an According-to-Hoyle<br />miracle is insignificant.
8136993 8140746 But what is significant<br />is, I felt the touch of God.
8140830 8142748 God got involved.
8142832 8144542 But why?
8144626 8147670 Well, that's what's fuckin'<br />with me: I don't know why.
8147754 8150715 -But I can't go back to sleep.<br />-You're serious.
8150799 8152675 You're really thinkin' about quittin'.
8152759 8155428 For life? Most definitely. Yeah.
8155512 8158848 Fuck. What you gonna do then?
8160183 8164395 Well, that's what I been<br />sitting here contemplating.
8164479 8168065 First I'm gonna deliver<br />this case to Marsellus.
8168149 8171235 Then, basically, I'm<br />just gonna walk the earth.
8171319 8174739 -What you mean, "Walk the earth"?<br />-Like Caine in <i>Kung Fu.</i>
8174823 8177783 Walk from place to place,<br />meet people, get in adventures.
8177867 8180120 And how long do you<br />intend to walk the earth?
8180204 8182144 Till God puts me where he wants me to be.
8182228 8183498 What if he don't do that?
8183582 8186517 If it takes forever,<br />then I'll walk forever.
8186601 8188503 So you decided to be a bum.
8188587 8192215 I'll just be Jules, Vincent.<br />No more, no less.
8192299 8194259 No, Jules, you decided to be a bum,
8194343 8197637 just like all those pieces of shit<br />out there who beg for change,
8197721 8200640 who sleep in garbage<br />bins, eat what I throw away.
8200724 8203685 They got a name for that, Jules…<br />It's called a bum.
8203769 8207439 And without a job, a residence or legal<br />tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.
8207523 8209399 You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.

8215406 8219910 Jules, look, what happened this<br />morning, man, I agree it was peculiar.
8219994 8223080 -But water into wine, I…<br />-All shapes and sizes, Vincent.
8223164 8226291 -Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.<br />-If my answers frighten you,
8226375 8228919 then you should cease<br />asking scary questions.
8231839 8233757 I'm gonna take a shit.
8236635 8239179 Let me ask you something.
8239263 8242641 When did you make this decision, when<br />you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?
8242725 8246645 Yeah. I was sittin' here eatin'<br />my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,
8246729 8248647 replayin' the incident in my head,
8248731 8252526 when I had what alcoholics<br />refer to as a moment of clarity.

8318593 8322597 Thought you said you were<br />gonna give me a fucking problem!
8322681 8327351 -I think we got a hero here, honey bunny.<br />-Well, just execute him!
8327435 8329395 [PANTING] I am not a hero.

8419069 8421029 In the bag.
8436127 8439046 -What's in the case?<br />-My boss' dirty laundry.
8439130 8441674 Your boss makes you do his laundry?<br />When he wants it clean.
8441758 8444427 -Sounds like a shit job.<br />-Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.
8444511 8447430 -Open it.<br />-'Fraid I can't do that.
8449474 8451810 -I didn't hear you.<br />-Yes, you did.
8452936 8455229 What's going on?
8455313 8457487 Looks like we got a<br />vigilante in our midst.
8457571 8458775 Shoot him in the face!
8458859 8460588 I hate to shatter<br />your ego, but this ain't
8460672 8462571 the first time I've had<br />a gun pointed at me.
8462655 8465028 If you don't take your hand<br />off that case, it'll be your last.
8465112 8466033 Stop causing problems!
8466117 8468910 You'll get us all killed! Give 'em<br />what you got and get 'em outta here!
8468994 8473206 Shut the fuck up, fat man!<br />This ain't none of your goddamn business!
8473290 8475542 Be cool, honey bunny, be cool.
8475626 8477670 No problem. I got it under control.
8479296 8481298 Now, I'm gonna count to three.
8482883 8486804 If you don't open that case, I'm<br />gonna unload in your fucking face.
8491225 8493144 We clear?
8496313 8498232 One.
8500067 8502569 Two.
8502653 8504696 -Three.<br />-Okay, Ringo.
8504780 8506865 You win.
8506949 8508868 It's yours.
8512913 8515666 -Open it.<br />-[LATCHES SPRINGING]
8519503 8521713 HONEY BUNNY: Hey, what is it?
8521797 8524132 What is it?
8524216 8526802 Is that what I think it is?
8526886 8529597 Mm-hmm.
8531182 8533266 It's beautiful.
8533350 8535895 [GIGGLING] Goddamn it, what is it?
8537396 8540315 You let him go! You let him go!
8540399 8543360 -Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!<br />-Tell that bitch to be cool.
8543444 8546363 Say, "Bitch, be cool!"<br />Say, "Bitch, be cool!" Be cool! Be cool!
8546447 8549157 -Tell that bitch to chill!<br />-You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!
8549241 8552119 Chill that fuckin' bitch out!<br />Chill out, honey bunny!
8552203 8553995 -Let go of him!<br />-Chill out, honey bunny!
8554079 8556957 Now, promise her it's gonna be all right!<br />I promise!
8557082 8558959 Tell her to chill!<br />Chill out, honey bunny!
8559043 8560961 Now tell me her name. Yolanda.
8561045 8564464 All right, now, Yolanda, we're not<br />gonna do anything stupid, are we?
8564548 8567467 -Don't you hurt him!<br />-Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!
8567551 8571054 We're all gonna be like three little<br />Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?
8571138 8574767 Come on, Yolanda!<br />What's Fonzie like? He's cool.
8574892 8576768 What? Cool.
8576852 8579688 Correctamundo.<br />And that's what we're gonna be.
8579772 8581690 We're gonna be cool.
8581774 8586653 Now, Ringo, <i>I'm</i> gonna count to three.
8586737 8588822 And when I count three,
8588906 8591825 I want you to let go of your gun,
8591909 8595412 put your palms flat on the<br />table and sit your ass down.
8596455 8600668 And when you do it, you do it cool.
8600752 8603045 You ready?
8603129 8609511 One, two, three.
8616476 8619604 [PANTING] Okay, now you let him go!<br />Yolanda!
8619688 8623274 I thought you were gonna be cool. Now,<br />when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.
8623358 8625443 When I get nervous, I get scared.
8625527 8629427 When motherfuckers get scared, that's<br />when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.
8630991 8634619 Just know, you hurt him, you die.
8634703 8638080 Well, that seems to be the situation.
8638164 8640082 But I don't want that.
8640166 8642084 And you don't want that.
8642168 8644879 And Ringo here<br />definitely doesn't want that.
8644963 8647090 So let's see what we can do.
8649467 8652720 Now… here's the situation.
8652804 8656641 Normally both your asses would<br />be dead as fuckin' fried chicken,
8656725 8660144 but you happened to pull this<br />shit while I'm in a transitional period,
8660228 8663147 and I don't wanna kill<br />you; I wanna help you.
8663231 8667151 But I can't give you this case,<br />'cause it don't belong to me.
8667235 8670154 Besides, I been through too much<br />shit over this case this morning…
8670238 8673157 To just hand it over to your dumb ass.
8673241 8675035 -Vincent!<br />-[YELLS]
8675160 8678079 Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.<br />Get back!
8678163 8680832 It's cool! We still just talkin'.
8680957 8683243 Come on. Point the gun at me.<br />Point the gun at me.
8683327 8684377 [YOLANDA WHIMPERING]
8684461 8687255 There you go.<br />Now, Vincent, you just hang back…
8687339 8689257 And don't do a goddamn thing.
8689341 8691217 Tell her it's still cool.
8691343 8694220 It's still cool, honey bunny.<br />How we doin', baby?
8695680 8698307 I… I gotta go pee.
8698391 8700309 I wanna go home.
8700393 8703980 Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.<br />And Ringo's proud of you.
8704064 8706983 It's almost over.<br />Tell her you're proud of her.
8707067 8710362 -I'm proud of you, honey bunny.<br />-I love you.
8710487 8713656 I love you too, honey bunny. Now,
8713740 8717702 I want you to go in that<br />bag and find my wallet.
8720205 8724167 Which one is it?<br />It's the one that says "bad motherfucker."
8738432 8740976 That's it. That's my bad motherfucker.
8741060 8744188 Open it up. Take out the money.
8749193 8751404 JULES: Count it.
8757702 8760246 How much is there?
8762123 8764041 About 1,500 dollars.
8764125 8767294 Okay, put it in your pocket. It's yours.
8767378 8770589 Now, with the rest of those<br />wallets and the register,
8770673 8772758 that makes this a pretty<br />successful little score, huh?
8772842 8774548 Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500
8774632 8776720 dollars, and I'll shoot<br />him on general principle.
8776804 8780223 No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna<br />do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!
8780307 8782351 Vince, shut the fuck up!
8782476 8786355 Shut up! Come on, Yolanda.<br />Stay with me, baby.
8786439 8789358 Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent.
8789442 8791318 I'm buyin' something for my money.
8792611 8795781 Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo? What?
8795865 8800577 Your life. I'm givin' you that money<br />so I don't have to kill your ass.
8800661 8803330 You read the Bible, Ringo?
8804457 8806375 Not regularly, no.
8806459 8808835 Well, there's this<br />passage I got memorized.
8808919 8812464 Ezekiel 25:17.
8812548 8815384 "The path of the righteous<br />man is beset on all sides…
8815468 8817386 "By the inequities of the selfish…"
8817470 8819346 "And the tyranny of evil men."
8819430 8822808 "Blessed is he who, in the<br />name of charity and good will,"
8822892 8825310 "shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness,"
8825394 8829481 "for he is truly his brother's<br />keeper and the finder of lost children."
8829565 8833860 "And I will strike down upon thee with<br />great vengeance and furious anger…"
8833944 8836988 "Those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy my brothers."
8837072 8840075 "And you will know I am the Lord…"
8840159 8843704 When I lay my vengeance upon you."
8844830 8847249 I been sayin' that shit for years,
8847333 8850460 and if you heard it, that meant your ass.
8850544 8853463 I never gave much<br />thought to what it meant.
8853547 8856466 I just thought it was some coldblooded<br />shit to say to a motherfucker…
8856550 8858969 Before I popped a cap in his ass.
8859053 8862472 But I saw some shit this<br />morning made me think twice.
8862556 8865475 See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means…
8865559 8870439 You're the evil man, and<br />I'm the righteous man,
8870523 8873442 and Mr. 9-millimeter<br />here, he's the shepherd…
8873526 8877070 Protecting my righteous<br />ass in the Valley of Darkness.
8877154 8879073 Or it could mean…
8879157 8882577 You're the righteous<br />man, and I'm the shepherd,
8882661 8886581 and it's the world<br />that's evil and selfish.
8886665 8888916 Yeah, I'd like that.
8889000 8891878 But that shit ain't the truth.
8891962 8893839 The truth is,
8894881 8896842 you're the weak…
8898218 8901596 And I'm the tyranny of evil men.
8903056 8904975 But I'm tryin', Ringo.
8906226 8909145 I'm tryin' real hard…
8909229 8911523 To be the shepherd.
8926830 8928748 Go.
8946433 8948810 I think we should be leaving now.
8948935 8951897 -["SURF RIDER"]<br />-Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
8958153 8962115 [MUSIC CONTINUES]
