30531 34155 Forget it. It's too risky.<br />I'm through doing that shit.
34500 37093 You always say that.<br />The same thing every time.
37118 39968 "l'm through, never again,<br />too dangerous."
39993 42408 I know that's what I always say.<br />I'm always right too.
42433 44271 You forget about it in a day or two.
44295 48023 The days of me forgetting are over. The<br />days of me remembering have just begun.
48048 50285 You know, when you go on like this,<br />what you sound like?
50310 53227 - I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.<br />- You sound like a duck.
53252 54613 Quack, quack, quack.
54637 56993 Take heart, 'cause you're<br />never gonna have to hear it again.
57018 60529 Since I'm never gonna do it again,<br />you're never gonna have to hear me quack.
60561 62000 After tonight?
62025 64572 Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
65290 68099 - Can I get anyone more coffee?<br />- Oh, yes!
70016 72578 - Thank you.<br />- You're welcome.
74113 77921 I mean, the way it is now, you're takin'<br />the same risk as when you rob a bank.
78486 80758 Takin' more of a risk.<br />Banks are easier.
80783 83769 Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you<br />in any way during a robbery.
83794 85648 They're insured.<br />Why should they give a fuck?
85672 88030 I don't even need a gun in a Federal bank.
88409 91373 Heard about this one bloke, he walks<br />into a bank with a portable phone.
91703 94787 He gives the phone to a teller.<br />The bloke on the other end says,
94812 96009 "We got this guy's little girl.
96034 98523 If you don't give him all your money,<br />we're gonna kill her."
98603 100309 - Did it work?<br />- Fuckin' right it worked.
100333 104159 That's what I'm talkin' about. Knucklehead<br />walks into a bank with a telephone.
104183 107356 Not a pistol, not a shotgun,<br />a fuckin' phone.
107458 109809 Cleans the place out.<br />They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
109833 111884 Did they hurt the little girl?
111909 115793 There probably never was a little girl.<br />The point of the story isn't a little girl.
115818 118831 The point of the story is<br />they robbed a bank with a telephone.
119179 120575 You want to rob banks?
120606 122001 I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.
122026 124478 I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be easier<br />than what we've been doing.
124503 125857 No more liquor stores?
125881 128530 What've we been talkin' about?<br />Yeah, no more liquor stores.
128763 130230 Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.
130255 132049 There's too many foreigners-owned<br />liquor stores.
132058 134124 Vietnamese, Koreans,<br />don't even speak fuckin' English.
134149 136635 You tell 'em empty out the register,<br />they don't know what you're talkin' about.
136660 137978 They make it too personal.
138003 140011 We keep on, one of these gook fuckers<br />gonna make us kill him.
140269 142203 I'm not gonna kill anybody.
142228 143815 I don't want to either.
143840 146629 But they'll probably put us in<br />a situation where it's us or them.
147147 148194 And if it's not the gooks,
148219 151481 it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned<br />the store for 15 fucking generations.
151506 155916 You got Grandpa lrving sitting behind the<br />counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.
155948 157648 Try walkin' into one of those places<br />with nothing but a phone.
157673 159609 See how far that gets you.<br />Forget it.
159634 162572 - We're out of it.<br />- Well, what then, day jobs?
162957 164984 - Not in this life.<br />- What then?
166979 168840 Gar�on, coffee!
169431 170739 This place.
173193 174848 Gar�on means boy.
179723 182294 This place? A coffee shop?
182467 184200 What's wrong with that?
185218 188885 Nobody ever robs restaurants. Why not?
189815 193360 Bars, liquor stores, gas stations;
193385 195741 you get your head blown off<br />stickin' up one of them.
196178 199595 Restaurants, on the other hand,<br />you catch with their pants down.
199804 203362 They're not expectin' to get robbed.<br />Not as expectin' anyway.
203387 207279 I bet you could cut down on<br />the hero factor in a place like this.
207291 208209 Correct.
208621 211489 Same as banks, these places are insured.
211514 214057 Manager. He don't give a fuck.
214082 216949 They're just trying to get you out<br />before you start pluggin' the diners.
216974 220873 Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way<br />they're takin' a bullet for the register.
220938 224161 Busboys. Some wetback gettin'<br />paid $1.50 an hour
224186 226778 really give a fuck<br />you're stealin' from the owner?
227008 230016 Customers sittin' there with food in their<br />mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.
230041 231526 One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet,
231550 233849 the next minute,<br />someone is stickin' a gun in their face.
234530 239363 See, I got the idea the last liquor store<br />we stuck up, remember?
239391 241143 All the customers kept comin' in.
241362 242262 Yeah.
242668 246506 You got the idea of takin' their wallets.<br />Now, that was a good idea.
246531 247241 Thank you.
247265 249255 Made more from the wallets<br />than we did from the register.
249280 250408 Yes, we did.
250539 252368 A lot of people<br />come to restaurants.
252393 253752 A lot of wallets.
254558 255761 Pretty smart, huh?
256746 258121 Pretty smart.
260093 262721 I'm ready. Let's do it.<br />Right now, right here.
263108 264866 - Come on.<br />- All right.
265648 267304 Same as last time, remember?
267441 270024 You're crowd control.<br />I'll handle the employees.
275609 278604 - I love you, Pumpkin.<br />- I love you, Honey Bunny.
280054 282164 Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!
282189 285351 Any of you fucking pricks move,
285376 289283 and I'll execute<br />every motherfuckin' last one of you.
426510 428975 Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars.
428999 430615 Okay, what you want to know?
430640 433619 - Hash is legal there, right?<br />- It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.
433644 438021 You just can't walk into a restaurant,<br />roll a joint and start puffin' away.
438046 441223 I mean, they want you to smoke in<br />your home or certain designated places.
441248 443913 - Those are hash bars?<br />- Yeah. It breaks down like this.
443938 446380 It's legal to buy it.<br />It's legal to own it.
446405 449812 And if you're the proprietor of<br />a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
449837 454221 It's illegal to carry it, but that doesn't<br />matter, 'cause get a load of this.
454246 458650 If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,<br />it's illegal for them to search you.
458833 461336 I mean, that's a right<br />the cops in Amsterdam don't have.
461368 464766 Oh, man! I'm goin'. That's all<br />there is to it. I'm fuckin' goin'.
464798 467313 I know, baby. You'd dig it the most.
468511 470604 But you know what the funniest thing<br />about Europe is?
470628 471498 What?
471523 472885 It's the little differences.
472909 475496 I mean, they got the same shit over there<br />that they got here,
475521 477318 but it's just there,<br />it's a little different.
477342 478466 Example.
478649 481946 You can walk into a movie theater<br />in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
481971 485744 And I don't mean just like no paper cup.<br />I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.
485777 488469 And in Paris,<br />you can buy a beer in McDonald's.
488739 493323 You know what they call<br />a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
493348 495643 They don't call it<br />a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?
495668 498539 They got the metric system. They wouldn't<br />know what the fuck a Quarter-Pounder is.
498564 502470 - What do they call it?<br />- They call it a Royale with Cheese.
502502 504500 - Royale with Cheese.<br />- That's right.
504525 506162 What do they call a Big Mac?
506288 509133 Big Mac's a Big Mac,<br />but they call it Le Big Mac.
509259 510609 Le Big Mac.
512488 513948 What do they call a Whopper?
513972 516092 I don't know. I didn't go into Burger King.
516772 519493 You know what they put on French fries<br />in Holland instead of ketchup?
519518 520206 What?
520231 522097 - Mayonnaise.<br />- Goddamn!
523259 526089 I seen 'em do it, man.<br />They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.
526113 527262 Yuck.
530367 532991 We should have shotguns<br />for this kind of deal.
536568 539093 - How many up there?<br />- Three or four.
539445 540746 That's countin' our guy?
541529 542591 Not sure.
543210 545599 So that means that it could be<br />up to five guys up there?
545605 546800 It's possible.
547297 549326 We should have fuckin' shotguns.
550042 551789 - What's her name?<br />- Mia.
551814 554882 Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
554907 559592 I don't know. However people meet<br />people. She used to be a actress.
559617 562110 Oh, really?<br />She do anything I'd have seen?
562283 565149 I think her biggest deal<br />was she starred in a pilot.
565173 566725 Pilot? What's a pilot?
566750 568690 Well, you know the shows on TV?
568781 570201 I don't watch TV.
570345 573978 Yeah, but you are aware that<br />there is an invention called television,
574003 576287 and on this invention<br />they show shows, right?
576311 577302 Yeah.
577327 581663 The way they pick TV shows is they make<br />one show. That show's called a pilot.
581688 584340 Then they show that one show<br />to the people who pick shows
584365 587551 and on the strength of that one show,<br />they decide if they wanna make more shows.
587576 592411 Some get chosen and become television<br />programs. Some don't, become nothin'.
593141 595845 She starred in one of the ones<br />that became nothing.
596299 598602 You remember Antwan Rockamora?
598627 602216 Half-black, half-Samoan.<br />Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror".
602241 603905 Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?
603929 605901 I wouldn't go so far as<br />to call the brother fat.
605926 608737 I mean, he got a weight problem.<br />What's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.
608762 610811 I think I know who you mean.<br />What about him?
610836 613184 Marsellus fucked him up good.
613209 617151 Word 'round the campfire is it was<br />on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
625667 629179 - So what he'd do? Fuck her?<br />- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.
629679 633167 - Well, then what then?<br />- He gave her a foot massage.
635490 637362 A foot massage?
637867 639532 - That's it?<br />- Mm-hmm.
639907 641843 Then what'd Marsellus do?
642065 645370 Sent a couple cats over to his place.<br />They took him out on his patio.
645395 649231 Threw his ass over the balcony.<br />Nigger fell four stories.
649256 653321 He had a little garden down at the bottom<br />enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.
653596 655613 Nigger fell through that.
655638 658576 Since then, he kind of developed<br />a speech impediment.
660202 662204 - That's a damn shame.<br />- Hmm.
667676 670923 But still, you play with matches,<br />you get burned.
670947 672247 What do you mean?
672272 675847 You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's<br />new bride a foot massage.
675872 677889 You don't think he overreacted?
677914 681133 Antwan probably didn't expect<br />Marsellus to react the way he did,
681157 683322 but he had to expect a reaction.
683347 687052 It was a foot massage. A foot massage is<br />nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.
687302 690968 It's laying your hands in a familiar way<br />on Marsellus's new wife.
691082 693665 I mean, is it as bad<br />as eatin' her pussy out?
693689 695990 No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.
696015 697502 Whoa, stop right there.
697527 699486 Eatin' the bitch out and<br />givin' the bitch a foot massage
699491 701164 ain't even the same fucking thing.
701189 704991 - It's not. It's the same ballpark.<br />- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.
705016 707947 Now, look, maybe your method<br />of massage differs from mine.
707972 709878 But touchin' his wife's feet
709903 713294 and sticking your tongue in the holiest<br />of holies ain't the same fuckin' ballpark;
713319 716002 it ain't the same league;<br />it ain't the same fuckin' sport.
716027 718259 Foot massages don't mean shit!
718284 720196 Have you ever given a foot massage?
721054 724798 Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.<br />I'm the foot fuckin' master.
724822 726107 You given a lot of them?
726132 729730 Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and<br />everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.
730142 732536 Would you give a guy a foot massage?
734531 735768 Fuck you.
737268 739820 - You give 'em a lot?<br />- Fuck you.
740196 742716 You know, I'm kind of tired.<br />I could use a foot massage.
742740 745986 Yo, yo, yo, man. You best back off.<br />I'm gettin' a little pissed here.
747759 749980 - This is the door.<br />- Yeah, it is.
753304 755282 What time you got?
755999 758142 7:22 in the a.m.
758167 761731 No, it ain't quite time yet.<br />Come on. Let's hang back.
769886 773228 Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man<br />a foot massage don't make it right
773253 776651 for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a<br />building into a glass motherfuckin' house,
776676 779153 fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;<br />that shit ain't right.
779178 781898 Motherfucker do that shit to me,<br />he better paralyze my ass,
781922 783522 'cause I kill the motherfucker.
783547 786934 I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin'<br />a massage don't mean nothin'.
786958 788512 I'm sayin' it does.
788537 791377 Now, look, I've given a million ladies<br />a million foot massages,
791401 793129 and they all meant somethin'.
793154 796948 We act like they don't, but they do.<br />That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.
796963 800528 There's a sensuous thing goin' on<br />where you don't talk about it,
800553 802572 but you know it and she knows it.
802597 806877 Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan<br />should've fuckin' better known better.
807630 811725 That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a<br />man with a sense of humor about this shit.
811951 813869 You know what I'm sayin'?
814979 816721 It's an interestin' point.
817021 818957 Come on. Let's get into character.
825438 827563 - What's her name again?<br />- Mia.
827588 830362 - Mia.<br />- Why you so interested in big man's wife?
830901 832685 He's goin' out of town, Florida.
832708 835715 And he asked me if I'd take care of her<br />while he's gone.
836349 837453 Take care of her?
837477 840132 No, man. Just take her out.
840307 843241 Show her a good time.<br />Make sure she don't get lonely.
843677 846204 You're gonna be takin'<br />Mia Wallace out on a date?
846229 848024 It is not a date.
849058 853086 It's just like if you were gonna take<br />your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.
853111 855253 It's just good company, that's all.
860861 864230 It's not a date.<br />It's definitely not a date.
871921 875793 Hey, kids. How you boys doin'?
876009 877625 Hey, keep chillin'.
885666 887174 You know who we are?
888141 892093 We're associates of your business partner,<br />Marsellus Wallace.
892118 894794 You do remember your business partner,<br />don't you?
897014 898863 Now, let me take a wild guess here.
902842 904328 You're Brett, right?
904785 905614 Yeah.
905639 911081 I thought so. You remember your business<br />partner Marsellus Wallace, don't ya, Brett?
912331 913709 Yeah, I remember.
913734 917772 Good. Looks like me and Vincent<br />caught you boys at breakfast.
917793 920423 Sorry about that. Whatcha havin'?
922013 922832 Hamburgers.
922857 926958 Hamburgers! The cornerstone<br />of any nutritious breakfast.
927626 929464 What kind of hamburgers?
930417 932539 - Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.<br />- No, no, no.
932557 935966 Where'd you get 'em? McDonald's,<br />Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box? Where?
936144 938355 Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.
938388 941465 Big Kahuna Burger!<br />That's that Hawaiian burger joint.
941530 945470 I hear they got some tasty burgers.<br />I ain't never had one myself. How are they?
946113 947887 They're- They're good.
947912 949783 You mind if I try one of yours?
951514 953499 - This is yours here, right?<br />- Yeah.
961586 966052 Mmmm. This is a tasty burger!
966341 967242 Vincent!
967411 969342 You ever had a Big Kahuna burger?
970319 972416 Want a bite? They're real tasty.
972748 973765 I ain't hungry.
973789 976485 Well, if you like burgers,<br />give 'em a try sometime.
976601 980570 Me, I can't usually get 'em<br />'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,
980595 983279 which pretty much makes me<br />a vegetarian.
983938 987104 But I do love the taste of<br />a good burger. Mmmm.
987925 990937 You know what they call<br />a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in France?
992352 993948 - No.<br />- Tell 'em, Vincent.
994065 997515 - A Royale with Cheese.<br />- A Royale with Cheese.
997789 999669 You know why they call it that?
1001373 1004436 Uh, because of the metric system?
1005319 1008479 Check out the big brain on Brett!
1008729 1012188 You're a smart motherfucker.<br />That's right. The metric system.
1014251 1016772 - What's in this?<br />- Sprite.

1036745 1038702 That hit the spot.
1039790 1042666 You. Flock of Seagulls.<br />You know why we're here?
1043877 1046472 Why don't you tell my man Vince here<br />where you got the shit hid.

1047513 1051001 I don't remember askin' you<br />a goddamned thing!
1055790 1057036 You were sayin'?

1091869 1093217 Yeah, we happy.
1097261 1099829 Look, I'm sorry, uh,<br />I-I didn't get your name.
1099854 1103031 I got yours. Vincent. Right?<br />B-But I never got yours.
1103056 1106674 My name's Pitt, and your ass<br />ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.
1106698 1108068 No, no, no.
1109860 1111388 I just want you to know how-
1115415 1118911 I just want you to know how sorry we are<br />th-that things got so fucked up
1118936 1120803 with us and Mr. Wallace.
1120828 1124792 W-We got into this thing with<br />the best intentions. Really. I never-
1126604 1129360 Oh, I'm sorry,<br />did I break your concentration?
1130130 1132282 I didn't mean to do that. Please.
1132307 1137240 Continue. You were saying something<br />about "best intentions".
1138539 1140045 What's the matter?
1140709 1142445 Oh, you were finished!
1142723 1145175 Oh, well, allow me to retort.
1148775 1151770 What does Marsellus Wallace look like?
1153129 1153925 What?
1155113 1156478 What country you from?
1156503 1157356 Wh-What?
1157381 1160472 "What" ain't no country I ever heard of.<br />They speak English in What?
1161252 1161846 What?
1161871 1164026 English, motherfucker! Do you speak it?
1164050 1164808 Yes!
1164833 1166421 - Then you know what I'm sayin'!<br />- Yes.
1166446 1170005 Describe what Marsellus Wallace<br />looks like!
1171092 1172816 - What? I-<br />- Say "what" again!
1172841 1176726 Say "what" again! I dare ya!<br />I double dare you, motherfucker!
1176751 1178733 Say "what" one more goddamn time!
1178758 1180595 H-H-He's black.
1180620 1181613 Go on!
1181982 1183121 He's bald!
1183146 1184756 Does he look like a bitch?
1184780 1185799 What?
1187479 1191550 Does he look... like a bitch?
1191575 1192564 No!
1192566 1194459 Then why you tryin' to fuck him<br />like a bitch?
1194484 1198376 - I didn't.<br />- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!
1198401 1200163 - You tried to fuck him.<br />- No, no.
1200188 1205301 But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be<br />fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
1206232 1207717 You read the Bible, Brett?
1208419 1209295 Yes!
1209320 1213740 Well, there's this passage I got<br />memorized. Sort of fits this occasion.
1213840 1216488 Ezekiel 25:17.
1217403 1221800 "The path of the righteous man<br />is beset on all sides
1221825 1226445 by the inequities of the selfish<br />and the tyranny of evil men.
1226897 1231997 Blessed is he who,<br />in the name of charity and goodwill,
1232022 1235065 shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness,
1235090 1240944 for he is truly his brother's keeper<br />and the finder of lost children.
1240969 1247459 And I will strike down upon thee with<br />great vengeance and furious anger
1247484 1251890 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy My brothers!
1251950 1259217 And you will know My name is the Lord<br />when I lay My vengeance upon thee!"
1277485 1282242 I think you gonna find<br />when all this shit is over and done,
1284485 1287899 I think you're gonna find yourself<br />one smilin' motherfucker.
1290433 1296314 The thing is, Butch...<br />right now you got ability.
1297912 1303462 But painful as it may be,<br />ability don't last.
1305624 1308127 And your days are just about over.
1309755 1312911 Now, that's a hard motherfuckin'<br />fact of life.
1314258 1318120 But that's a fact of life your ass<br />is gonna have to get realistic about.
1321245 1325572 You see, this business is filled to<br />the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.
1326778 1330741 Motherfuckers who thought<br />their ass would age like wine.
1332504 1336239 If you mean it turns to vinegar... it does.
1337492 1341762 If you mean it gets better with age...<br />it don't.
1343113 1344949 Besides, Butch,
1346897 1349771 how many fights you think<br />you got in you anyway?
1350887 1351900 Hmm?
1353012 1354084 Two?
1356177 1358573 Boxers don't have an old-timers' day.
1360694 1363542 You came close, but you never made it.
1364664 1367959 And if you were gonna make it,<br />you would have made it before now.
1385511 1387153 You my nigger?
1392511 1394358 Certainly appears so.
1401401 1404790 The night of the fight,<br />you may feel a slight sting.
1408449 1411360 That's pride fuckin' with you.
1412968 1414776 Fuck pride!
1417155 1418748 Pride only hurts.
1420314 1421980 It never helps.
1423722 1425659 You fight through that shit.
1427301 1432209 'Cause a year from now,<br />when you kickin' it in the Caribbean,
1432234 1436824 you gonna say to yourself,<br />"Marsellus Wallace was right."
1439064 1441369 I got no problem with that, Mr. Wallace.
1443466 1447209 In the fifth, your ass goes down.
1451373 1452688 Say it.
1455530 1457918 In the fifth, my ass goes down.
1460885 1463693 Yo, Vincent Vega. Our man in Amsterdam.
1463718 1467593 Jules Winfield, our man in lnglewood.<br />Get your asses on in here.
1468343 1470679 Goddamn, nigger,<br />what's up with them clothes?
1470704 1472304 You don't even want to know.
1474065 1475460 Where's the big man?
1475485 1477988 The big man's right over there<br />takin' care of some business.
1478238 1482703 Why don't you hang back a second or two.<br />You see the white boy leave, go on over.
1485809 1487202 How ya been?
1487613 1489705 I been doin' pretty good.<br />How 'bout yourself?
1489730 1490792 All right.
1494369 1496680 So I hear you're takin' Mia out tomorrow.
1499325 1501477 At Marsellus's request.
1503589 1505808 - Have you met Mia?<br />- Not yet.
1506857 1508495 What's so fuckin' funny?
1508520 1511117 - Not a goddamn thing.<br />- I got to piss.
1512028 1515891 Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot,<br />all right? It's the big man's wife.
1515916 1518832 I'm gonna sit across from her,<br />chew my food with my mouth closed,
1518857 1520803 laugh at her fuckin' jokes, and that's it.
1520828 1523662 Hey, my name's Paul,<br />and this shit's between y'all.
1523982 1526236 Then what'd you fuckin'<br />ask me about it for?
1526685 1527863 Asshole.
1535664 1537588 - Gimme a pack of Red Apples.<br />- Filters?
1537613 1538620 No.
1542583 1544378 You lookin' at somethin', friend?
1544416 1546310 You ain't my friend, palooka.
1548654 1549804 What was that?
1549828 1552073 I think you heard me just fine, punchy.
1552550 1554558 Vincent Vega's in the house?
1554959 1558119 My nigger, get your ass over here.
1565947 1568383 - What's up?<br />- Man, I'm really sorry.
1569158 1570868 You shouldn't worry about it.
1570957 1573929 Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.
1576294 1577892 And some matches.
1581987 1583191 Thanks.
1585583 1589922 It's as if it turns every part of<br />your body into the tip of a penis.
1590215 1591291 Whoa.
1591322 1593496 I'll lend it to you.<br />It's a great book on piercing.
1594714 1598421 That gun to pierce your ears, they don't<br />use that to pierce your nipples, do they?
1598446 1602377 Forget that gun. That guns goes against<br />the entire idea behind piercing.
1602926 1607800 All my piercing, 18 places on my body,<br />every one of 'em done with a needle.
1607825 1610904 Five in each ear, one through<br />the nipple of my left breast,
1611424 1614224 two in my right nostril,<br />one in my left eyebrow,
1614249 1616917 one in my belly,<br />one in my lip, one in my clit,
1616942 1619206 and I wear a stud in my tongue.
1619409 1620460 Excuse me.
1621083 1626467 I was just curious, but, um... why<br />would you wear a stud in your tongue?
1627040 1630163 Sex thing. Helps fellatio.
1630435 1633698 Vincenzo. Step in my office.
1640973 1644003 This is Panda from Mexico.<br />Very good stuff.
1644028 1647149 Now, that's Bava.<br />Different, but equally good.
1647174 1650112 And that is Choco<br />from the Harz Mountains of Germany.
1650458 1654713 Now, the first two are the same.<br />300 a gram. Those are friend prices.
1655470 1657994 But this one is a little more expensive.
1658117 1660028 This is 500 a gram.
1660053 1663873 But, when you shoot it, you will know<br />where that extra money went.
1663898 1667998 There's nothing wrong with these two.<br />This is real, real, real good shit.
1668140 1671127 But this one is a fuckin' madman.
1671880 1674646 Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.
1674895 1677848 Am I a nigger?<br />Are we in lnglewood? No.
1677873 1681039 You're in my home. Now, white people<br />who know the difference
1681064 1684013 between good shit and bad shit,<br />this is the house they come to.
1684142 1687564 Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi<br />Challenge with that Amsterdam shit
1687586 1689324 any old day of the fuckin' week.
1689348 1690981 That's a bold statement.
1691246 1694572 This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.<br />This is a seller's market.
1694924 1698921 Coke is fuckin' dead as... dead.
1698949 1702080 Heroin, it's comin' back<br />in a big fuckin' way.
1704288 1706763 All right. Gimme three grams of madman.
1706787 1707749 Okay.
1707774 1711177 Now, if it's as good as you say it is,<br />I'll come back and buy another thousand.
1711202 1713402 I just hope that I still<br />have some left for ya,
1713827 1718105 but I'm givin' you some<br />out of my own private stash.
1718130 1719870 That is what a nice guy I am.
1721595 1724391 I'm outta balloons. Is a baggie all right?
1724418 1725512 Yeah, that's cool.
1725537 1727530 All right. I'll just get one for ya.
1727555 1732661 Honey, will you get me some baggies<br />and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?
1732686 1733804 Okay.
1734482 1736734 Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi?
1736759 1740282 She ain't got a boyfriend.<br />You wanna hang out and get high?
1740306 1743674 Which one's Trudi? The one<br />with all the shit in her face?
1743702 1747521 No, that's Jody. That's my wife.
1750250 1752309 - I'm sorry, man.<br />- Thank you.
1753118 1756828 - No, I can't. I gotta be someplace.<br />- All right, no problemo.
1756853 1758265 I'll take a rain check.
1761951 1763318 Thank you, Jody.
1763627 1765176 Still got your Malibu?
1766535 1769913 Oh, man, you know what some fucker<br />did the other day?
1769938 1771923 - What?<br />- Fuckin' keyed it.
1772033 1775631 - Oh, man, that's fucked up.<br />- Tell me about it.
1775790 1778279 I had it in storage for three years.
1778304 1782561 It was out five days, and some<br />dickless piece of shit fucked with it.
1782586 1786850 They should be fuckin' killed, man.<br />No trial, no jury, straight to execution.
1786870 1791808 I wish I could've caught him doin' it. I'd<br />have given anything to catch that asshole.
1792290 1795266 It'd been worth him doin' it<br />just so I could've caught him.
1795290 1796567 What a fucker!
1796592 1799389 What's more chicken-shit<br />than fuckin' with a man's automobile?
1799414 1802431 - Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.<br />- You don't do it.
1802456 1804064 It's just against the rules.
1804088 1805092 Thank you.
1805117 1806331 Thank you.
1807353 1810225 - Mind if I shoot up here?<br />- Hey, mi casa es su casa.
1810250 1811775 Muchas gracias.

1984136 1985390 Okay.
2050050 2051490 Let's go.

2059422 2061758 This is Jackrabbit Slim's.
2062865 2065037 An Elvis man should love it.
2065187 2066854 Come on, Mia. Let's go get a steak.
2066878 2069320 You can get a steak here, daddy-o.
2069578 2071109 Don't be a...

2095718 2098802 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<br />Now, how may I help you?
2098984 2101820 - There's a reservation under Wallace.<br />- Wallace?
2103600 2105996 - We reserved a car.<br />- Oh, a car.
2106901 2109095 Why don't you seat 'em<br />over there in the Chrysler.
2175127 2177924 Let's hear it for Ricky Nelson!
2178968 2180556 Fantastic job, Rick. Thank you very much.

2193999 2195359 Thank you.
2195384 2203124 Call for Phillip Morris.
2203330 2204746 What do you think?
2205370 2208236 I think it's like<br />a wax museum with a pulse.
2208794 2210881 Hi, I'm Buddy. What can I get you?
2215452 2217407 Let's see, steak, steak, steak.
2217431 2219791 Oh, yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.
2220468 2221492 I'll have that.
2221517 2224350 How do you want that cooked?<br />Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell?
2224374 2227566 Bloody as hell, and... Oh, yeah,<br />look at this... vanilla Coke.
2229559 2231127 What about you, Peggy Sue?
2231785 2238301 I'll have the...<br />Durward Kirby burger, bloody.
2239030 2243033 And... a five-dollar shake.
2243283 2245746 How do you want that shake,<br />Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?
2245770 2247086 Martin and Lewis.
2247836 2249905 Did you just order a five-dollar shake?
2250492 2251605 Mm-hmm.
2252158 2254721 That's a shake?<br />That's milk and ice cream?
2255172 2256425 Last I heard.
2256450 2259615 That's five dollars?<br />You don't put bourbon in it or nothin'?
2259885 2260861 No.
2261064 2262267 Just checking.
2262372 2264411 I'll be right back with your drinks.
2272648 2276489 Could you, um...<br />roll me one of those, cowboy?
2277735 2279676 You can have this one, cowgirl.
2280351 2281495 Thanks.
2286203 2287951 Think nothin' of it.
2294753 2295816 So,
2296599 2299213 Marsellus said<br />you just got back from Amsterdam.
2299554 2301617 - Sure did.<br />- How long were you there?
2303207 2304635 Just over three years.
2307233 2310069 I go there about once a year<br />to chill out for a month.
2310762 2313686 No kiddin'? I didn't know that.
2315209 2316499 Why would you?
2321435 2323371 I heard you did a pilot.
2324941 2326685 That was my 15 minutes.
2327411 2328601 What was it?
2328893 2333223 It was a show about a team of female<br />secret agents called Fox Force Five.
2333499 2335965 - What?<br />- Fox Force Five.
2336125 2338505 Fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks.
2338532 2341186 Force, as in we're a force<br />to be reckoned with.
2341211 2343799 And five, as in there's<br />one-two-three-four-five of us.
2344610 2347660 There was a blond one, Sommerset O'Neal.<br />She was the leader.
2347969 2354573 The Japanese fox was a kung fu master.<br />The black girl was a demolition expert.
2354978 2357767 French fox's speciality was sex.
2357873 2359498 What was your speciality?
2360138 2361268 Knives.
2362338 2364435 The character I played, Raven McCoy,
2364460 2368332 her background was she grew up<br />raised by circus performers.
2368627 2372664 According to the show, she was the<br />deadliest woman in the world with a knife.
2373250 2375540 And she knew a zillion old jokes.
2375565 2378940 Her grandfather, an old vaudevillian,<br />taught her.
2379732 2381733 And if we would have got picked up,
2381758 2386726 they would've worked in a gimmick where<br />every show I would've told another joke.
2389181 2391032 You know any of them old jokes?
2391057 2394551 Well, I only got the chance to say one<br />'cause we only did one show.
2394978 2396029 Tell me.
2396189 2397379 It's corny.
2398557 2400407 Don't be that way. Tell me.
2400432 2403468 No, you wouldn't like it,<br />and I'd be embarrassed.
2403492 2408090 You'd be... You told 50 million people,<br />and you can't tell me?
2408367 2412127 - I promise I won't laugh.<br />- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.
2412760 2414827 That's not what I meant. You know it.
2414852 2418189 Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you<br />'cause it's been built up too much.
2418448 2419889 What a gyp.
2422806 2424288 Martin and Lewis.
2427155 2428729 Vanilla Coke.
2433931 2437256 Mmm. Yummy.
2437768 2439671 You think I could have a sip of that?
2442905 2444191 Be my guest.
2444555 2446957 I gotta know what<br />a five-dollar shake tastes like.
2448103 2450278 You can use my straw. I don't have cooties.
2450489 2451937 Yeah, but maybe I do.
2451962 2453400 Cooties I can handle.
2454989 2456266 All right.
2464287 2466938 Goddamn, that's a pretty<br />fuckin' good milkshake!
2467084 2467840 Told ya.
2467865 2470750 I don't know if it was worth $5,<br />but it's pretty fuckin' good.
2505646 2507221 Don't you hate that?
2508058 2509224 Hate what?
2509551 2511508 Uncomfortable silences.
2513205 2517928 Why do we feel it's necessary to yak<br />about bullshit in order to be comfortable?
2519058 2521897 I don't know.<br />That's a good question.
2523195 2526198 That's when you know<br />you found somebody really special.
2527168 2531671 When you can just shut the fuck up for<br />a minute and comfortably share silence.
2531696 2535708 Well, I don't think we're quite there yet,<br />but don't feel bad. We just met each other.
2537450 2539164 I'll tell you what.
2540755 2543463 I'm gonna go to the bathroom<br />and powder my nose.
2543926 2547242 You sit here...<br />and think of something to say.
2548157 2549865 I'll do that.
2553797 2554640 Okay.
2579979 2582107 I said goddamn!
2582132 2585298 Goddamn! Goddamn.
2596208 2597595 Mmmm.
2598393 2601034 Don't you just love it when<br />you come back from the bathroom
2601059 2602897 to find your food waiting for you?
2603150 2605272 We're lucky we got anything at all.
2605297 2607600 I don't think Buddy Holly's<br />much of a waiter.
2608600 2610912 Maybe we should've sat in<br />Marilyn Monroe's section.
2611446 2613813 - Which one? There's two Monroes.<br />- No, there's not.
2614623 2616387 That is Marilyn Monroe.
2618165 2620335 That is Mamie Van Doren.
2621238 2624768 I don't see Jayne Mansfield,<br />so she must have the night off.
2625158 2626550 Pretty smart.
2626816 2628597 Yeah. I got my moments.
2628947 2630688 So did you think of somethin' to say?
2630906 2632395 Actually, I did.
2634390 2635803 However...
2639147 2641414 ...you seem like a really nice person,<br />and I...
2641536 2643654 - I don't want to offend you.<br />- Oooh.
2644479 2649227 This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless,<br />boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.
2649544 2652065 This sounds like<br />you actually have somethin' to say.
2652090 2654926 Well, well, I do. I do.
2656073 2658265 But you have to promise not to be offended.
2658290 2659674 No, no.
2660067 2663941 You can't promise somethin' like that.<br />I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.
2663956 2665945 You can ask me what you're gonna ask me,
2665970 2668548 and my natural response<br />could be to get offended.
2668646 2671368 Then, through no fault of my own,<br />I would have broken my promise.
2671650 2674404 - Let's just forget it.<br />- That's an impossibility.
2674532 2678331 Trying to forget anything as intriguing<br />as this would be an exercise in futility.
2678356 2679597 Is that a fact?
2679621 2683994 And besides, isn't it more, uh, exciting<br />when you don't have permission?
2684019 2685551 All right, all right.
2685576 2687371 Well, here goes.
2688490 2691431 What did you think about<br />what happened to Antwan?
2691456 2694896 - Who's Antwan?<br />- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.
2695623 2698229 - He fell out of a window.<br />- Hmm. Hmm.
2698600 2700355 Well, that is one way to say it.
2700367 2702862 Another way to say it would be that<br />he was thrown out.
2703047 2706213 Another way would be<br />he was thrown out by Marsellus.
2706238 2710454 Yet even another way is to say<br />he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus
2710478 2711539 because of you.
2712074 2713373 Is that a fact?
2713645 2717380 No. No, it's not a fact. It's just<br />what I heard. That's just what I heard.
2717757 2720119 - Who told you?<br />- They.
2721155 2722915 "They" talk a lot, don't they?
2724842 2727506 They certainly do. They certainly do.
2727710 2729729 Don't be shy, Vincent.<br />What else did "they" say?
2729754 2731497 I'm... I'm not shy.
2732647 2734444 Did it involve the "F" word?
2734469 2738538 No, no, no, no, no. They just said that<br />Antwan had given you a foot massage.
2740284 2742424 - And?<br />- And... And nothin'.
2742758 2744123 That's it.
2746494 2750445 You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror<br />out of a fourth-story window
2750470 2752303 for giving me a foot massage?
2752328 2754339 - Mm-hmm.<br />- And you believe that?
2755920 2759069 Well, at the time<br />I was told it sounded reasonable.
2759094 2762482 Marsellus throwing Tony out<br />of a fourth-story window
2762507 2764897 for massaging my feet<br />seemed reasonable?
2764922 2767828 No, it seemed excessive,<br />but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.
2768116 2771578 I understand that Marsellus<br />is very protective of you.
2772372 2775899 A husband being protective<br />of his wife is one thing.
2776298 2780080 A husband almost killing another man for<br />touching his wife's feet is something else.
2780884 2782208 But did it happen?
2782233 2787952 Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was<br />my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.
2788831 2789977 Really?
2790663 2793824 Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus<br />threw Tony out that window
2793849 2795785 except Marsellus and Tony.
2796491 2800012 When you little scamps get together,<br />you're worse than a sewing circle.
2800037 2804602 Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment<br />you've all been waiting for.
2804627 2809187 The world-famous<br />Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.
2813461 2816609 Now, this is where one lucky couple
2816634 2820701 will win this handsome trophy<br />that Marilyn here is holding.
2821021 2824427 Now, who will be our first contestants?
2824452 2825880 - Right here!<br />- All right!
2827588 2830122 - I wanna dance.<br />- No, no, no, no, no.
2830147 2835016 No, no, no, no, no. I do believe<br />Marsellus, my husband, your boss,
2835041 2838091 told you to take me out<br />and do whatever I wanted.
2838116 2842039 Now I wanna dance;<br />I wanna win; I want that trophy.
2842050 2843932 - So dance good.<br />- All right. You asked for it.
2843957 2846093 Let's hear it for our first contestants.
2852454 2855455 Now let's meet our first contestants here<br />this evening.
2855479 2857604 Young lady, what is your name?
2857817 2859810 Mrs. Mia Wallace.
2859835 2862291 And how 'bout your fella here?
2862557 2864135 Vincent Vega.
2864427 2867281 All right, let's see what you can do.<br />Take it away!
2867962 2869204 Go for it.
2869454 2870584 Come on!
3031907 3034615 Is that what you call<br />an uncomfortable silence?
3035228 3037713 I don't know what you call that.
3039708 3041700 Drinks! Music!
3042332 3044077 I'm gonna take a piss.
3045024 3049633 That's a little bit more information<br />than I needed, but go right ahead.
3102519 3104887 One drink, and that's it.
3105092 3108930 Don't be rude.<br />Drink your drink, but do it quickly.
3110569 3112904 Say good night... and go home.
3148270 3154704 You see, this is a moral test of oneself.<br />Whether or not you can maintain loyalty.
3154736 3158167 Because... being loyal is very important.
3204413 3205842 Hello.
3208989 3210310 So, you're gonna go out there
3210335 3213137 and you're gonna say, "Good night.<br />I've had a very lovely evening."
3214506 3217071 Walk out the door, get in the car,
3217081 3219596 go home, jerk off,<br />and that's all you gonna do.
3267431 3269141 All right, Mia.
3269639 3272737 So listen, I gotta go, all right?
3275928 3278950 Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
3279446 3282145 You fu- Oh, Jesus Christ!
3282170 3285061 Oh, fuck me. Fuck me! Oh-
3285450 3289159 Come on, girl. We're gettin' outta here.<br />We gotta walk now.
3299926 3302172 Don't fuckin' die on me, Mia!
3303143 3304032 Fuck!
3312184 3313526 Answer.
3313859 3315463 Have you got the ring?
3315488 3319033 - Why, certainly.<br />- Join hands, you two lovebirds.
3320103 3324463 - Please! Please!<br />- Yes, yes. Hold hands, you lovebirds.
3331336 3333404 Fuck you, Lance! Answer!
3339109 3341970 - Now what do you say?<br />- I give up! I'll marry you!
3345625 3348438 Lance! The goddamn phone's ringing!
3350011 3351694 I can hear it.
3351974 3355000 I thought you told those fuckin'<br />assholes never to call here this late!
3355025 3356430 Yeah, I told them.
3356455 3360006 And that is exactly what I'm going<br />to tell this fucking asshole right now.
3363169 3364535 Don't you dare strike me!
3364650 3365312 Hello.
3365337 3367061 Lance! Vincent.
3367706 3370565 I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.<br />I'm coming to your house.
3370590 3374690 Wh-Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man.<br />Wh-What's the problem?
3374715 3376718 I got this chick,<br />she's fuckin' O. D.in' on me!
3376742 3378248 Well, don't bring her here!
3378273 3379936 I'm not even joking with you!
3379960 3382429 Do not be bringing<br />some fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!
3382454 3383496 No choice.
3383683 3384786 She's O.D.in'?
3384811 3386837 She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!
3387859 3392040 Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet,<br />take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.
3392059 3392851 Negative!
3392870 3394772 This is not my fuckin' problem, man!
3394797 3397393 You fucked her up,<br />you fuckin' deal with this!
3398398 3401033 Uh, are you talkin' to me<br />on a cellular phone?
3401778 3404059 I don't know you.<br />Who is this? Don't come here!
3404084 3406539 I'm hanging up the phone!<br />Prank caller! Prank caller!
3416835 3418533 What the hell was that?
3420270 3422555 Have you lost your fucking mind?
3422580 3424578 You were talking about drug shit<br />on a cellular phone!
3424591 3426199 You crashed your car into my fucking house!
3426223 3427473 Grab her feet.
3428279 3431785 Are you deaf? You are not bringing<br />this fucked-up bitch into my house!
3432068 3434465 This "fucked-up bitch" is<br />Marsellus Wallace's wife.
3434490 3436633 - Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?<br />- Yeah.
3436658 3439216 If she croaks on me,<br />I am a fucking grease spot!
3440592 3445546 I will be forced to tell him that you did<br />not help and let her die on your lawn.
3445571 3448097 Now, come on. Help me, help me.<br />Pick her up.
3449308 3450655 Shit.
3453375 3454691 Lance!
3455953 3457113 Shit.
3458264 3462280 It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.<br />What the fuck's going on out here?
3464179 3465561 Who's she?
3465586 3468524 Go to the fridge and get the thing<br />with the adrenalin shot.
3468549 3469755 What's wrong with her?
3469779 3470782 She's O.D.ing!
3470807 3471867 Get her outta here!
3471891 3472973 Get the shot!
3472998 3475059 Fuck you! Fuck you too!
3475083 3476715 What a fuckin' bitch.
3476740 3478386 Just keep talking to her, all right?
3478395 3480874 She's gettin' the shot. I'm going to go<br />get my little black medical book.
3480898 3482708 What the fuck you need<br />a medical book for?
3482733 3485283 - I've never had to give an adrenalin shot.<br />- You never give an adrenalin shot?
3485315 3488011 I've never had to, all right! I don't go<br />joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers!
3488035 3489291 My friends can handle their highs!
3489316 3491255 - Get the shot!<br />- I am, if you'll let me!
3491280 3492434 I ain't stopping you!
3492458 3494157 Stop talking to me. Start talking to her!
3494182 3495952 - Get the shot!<br />- All right!
3499749 3503189 - Hurry up. We're losing her!<br />- I'm looking as fast as I can!
3503214 3504651 What's he looking for?
3505171 3506856 I don't know. Some book.
3506880 3508487 What are you looking for?
3508512 3509993 A little black medical book.
3510017 3511285 What are you looking for?
3511310 3514964 My little black medical book!<br />It's like a textbook they give to nurses.
3515559 3518497 - I never saw no medical book.<br />- Trust me. I have one.
3518778 3520742 If it's so important,<br />why don't you keep it with the shot?
3520767 3522614 I don't know! Stop bothering me!
3522648 3525450 Listen. While you're looking,<br />that girl's gonna die on our carpet.
3525475 3527478 You're never gonna find anything<br />in this mess!
3527503 3529117 I'm gonna fucking kill you<br />if you don't shut up!
3529141 3530830 Lance, get in here!
3531740 3532654 Right?
3532679 3534468 Get the fuck outta my way.
3534493 3535572 Pig.
3535597 3538038 Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot.<br />Come on.
3538062 3541205 Look. While I'm doing this, you take off<br />her shirt and find her heart.
3542169 3543340 Does it gotta be exact?
3543365 3546187 We're giving her a shot in the heart,<br />so I guess it's gotta be fucking exact.
3546212 3548802 I don't know exactly where her heart is.<br />I think it's right here.
3548837 3550217 - That's it.<br />- That's it?
3550259 3552918 All right, what I need is<br />a big, fat magic marker.
3553577 3554902 - You got it?<br />- What?
3554927 3556351 A magic marker.
3556719 3560274 A felt pen! A fuckin'<br />black magic marker! Christ.
3560474 3561687 Come on, man. Hurry up!
3561717 3565652 Fuck! Okay, okay. Okay. I think it's ready.
3568583 3571077 - Hurry up, man.<br />- I'll tell you what to do.
3572182 3574375 - You're gonna give her the shot.<br />- No, you're gonna give her the shot.
3574404 3576202 I ain't giving her the shot.<br />I never done this before.
3576227 3578404 I never done this either!<br />I ain't starting now!
3578429 3580581 Look. You brought her here and<br />that means you're gonna give her the shot.
3580606 3583569 The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch to<br />your house, then I give her the shot.
3583580 3584668 - Give it to me.<br />- Here.
3584679 3585768 Give me that.
3587127 3588937 All right, tell me what to do.
3588962 3592307 Okay, you're giving her an injection<br />of adrenalin straight to her heart.
3592332 3594930 But she's got a breastplate...<br />You gotta pierce through that.
3594955 3598300 You gotta bring the needle down<br />in a stabbing motion.
3598303 3599766 I gotta... I gotta stab her three times?
3599808 3601730 No, just stab her once!
3601748 3604433 But it's gotta be hard enough to get<br />through her breastplate into her heart.
3604912 3607518 Once you do that,<br />you p-press down on the p-plunger.
3607524 3609177 Okay. Then what happens?
3609649 3610805 Kinda curious about that myself.
3610830 3613435 This ain't no fuckin' joke!<br />Am I gonna kill her?
3613447 3615190 She's supposed to come out of it like that.
3615509 3616977 All right, count to three.
3617002 3618701 - All right. Ready?<br />- One.
3624729 3625898 Two.
3634714 3635381 Three!
3650716 3653882 If you're all right, then say something.
3654779 3656250 Something.
3657680 3659419 That was fuckin' trippy.
3661662 3662532 Ohh.
3662540 3663757 Oh, man.
3689697 3691633 Mia. Mia.
3693746 3696183 What's...
3696753 3700607 What's your thoughts on...<br />on how to handle this?
3701473 3702941 What's yours?
3706286 3710568 Well, I'm of the opinion that<br />if Marsellus lived his whole life,
3710593 3712922 he doesn't need to know nothing<br />about this incident.
3714828 3719038 If Marsellus knew about this incident,<br />I'd be in as much trouble as you.
3719371 3721120 I seriously doubt that.
3722274 3724639 I can keep a secret if you can.
3726849 3728238 Shake on it?
3734453 3736022 Mum's the word?
3736851 3737986 Cool.
3738899 3741722 Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going<br />to go home and have a heart attack.
3745680 3746861 Vincent.
3749151 3751898 Do you wanna hear my Fox Force Five joke?
3753383 3754631 Sure.
3755289 3758524 Except I think I'm still<br />a little too petrified to laugh.
3758546 3760900 No, you won't laugh<br />'cause it's not funny.
3761261 3763554 But if you still wanna hear it,<br />I'll tell it.
3764416 3765747 I can't wait.
3766171 3766929 Okay.
3767433 3769482 Three tomatoes are walkin' down the street.
3769507 3771825 Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato<br />and Baby Tomato.
3772069 3776472 Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,<br />and Papa Tomato gets really angry.
3776718 3779656 Goes back and squishes him and says,
3779682 3780952 "Ketchup."
3784677 3785863 Ketchup.
3790851 3792297 See you around.
3814147 3817788 Oh, that Paddlefoot.<br />He funny, silly dog.
3817813 3820537 He think totem pole alive!
3821641 3823595 He arctic tenderfoot!
3825302 3827901 That totem pole been here forever!
3827926 3828942 Butch?
3829576 3832207 One more thing, and we'll start for...
3832231 3834201 Butch, stop watching TV for a second.
3834847 3836910 - Yeah?<br />- You've got a special visitor.
3840917 3845443 Now, do you remember when I told you<br />your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp?
3848325 3852640 Well, this here is Captain Koons.<br />He was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.
3859105 3863971 Hello, little man.<br />Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.
3864881 3867704 See, I was a good friend of your dad's.
3868073 3873083 We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together<br />over five years.
3873791 3878517 Hopefully, you'll never have<br />to experience this yourself,
3878542 3884166 but when two men are in a situation like me<br />and your dad were for as long as we were,
3885349 3888337 you take on certain responsibilities<br />of the other.
3889580 3894717 If it'd been me who'd not made it,
3894742 3898926 Major Coolidge'd be talking right now<br />to my son Jim.
3899912 3902773 But the way it turned out,<br />I'm talking to you.
3904237 3905625 Butch,
3907422 3909358 I got something for ya.
3916285 3918459 This watch I got here
3918484 3922636 was first purchased by your great-<br />grandfather during the first World War.
3923126 3927276 It was bought in a little general store<br />in Knoxville, Tennessee.
3927799 3931364 Made by the first company<br />to ever make wristwatches.
3931492 3934679 Up 'til then, people just<br />carried pocket watches.
3934704 3940457 It was bought by Private Doughboy Erine<br />Coolidge on the day he set sail for Paris.
3940734 3943171 This was your<br />great-grandfather's war watch,
3943196 3946016 and he wore it every day<br />he was in that war, and...
3946793 3950384 ...when he'd done his duty,<br />he went home to your great-grandmother,
3950409 3955326 took the watch off, put it in an old<br />coffee can, and in that can it stayed
3955330 3959816 until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,<br />was called upon by his country
3959837 3963109 to go overseas and fight<br />the Germans once again.
3963134 3965540 This time they called it World War II.
3966828 3971173 Your great-grandfather gave this watch<br />to your granddad for good luck.
3971908 3974921 Unfortunately, Dane's luck<br />wasn't as good as his old man's.
3974946 3977884 Dane was a Marine, and he was killed,
3977909 3980894 along with all the other Marines<br />at the battle of Wake lsland.
3981520 3983937 Your granddad was facing death.
3984895 3986248 He knew it.
3986941 3991409 None of those boys ever had any illusions<br />about leaving that island alive,
3991434 3994378 so three days before the Japanese<br />took the island,
3994403 3999105 your granddad asked a gunner on<br />an Air Force transport, name of Winocki,
3999913 4005549 a man he'd never met before in<br />his life, to deliver to his infant son,
4005574 4009504 who he'd never seen in the flesh,<br />his gold watch.
4010220 4014558 Three days later, your granddad<br />was dead, but Winocki kept his word.
4015335 4019085 After the war was over,<br />he paid a visit to your grandmother,
4019110 4023081 delivering to your infant father<br />his dad's gold watch.
4023386 4024861 This watch.
4031203 4036267 This watch was on your daddy's wrist<br />when he was shot down over Hanoi.
4036684 4040124 He was captured,<br />put in a Vietnamese prison camp.
4040149 4047269 He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch,<br />it'd be confiscated, taken away.
4047826 4051527 The way your dad looked at it,<br />this watch was your birthright.
4051552 4054356 He'd be damned if any slope's<br />gonna put their greasy, yellow hands
4054384 4055619 on his boy's birthright,
4055644 4059757 so he hid it in one place he knew<br />he could hide something, his ass.
4059782 4063157 Five long years<br />he wore this watch up his ass.
4063182 4067234 Then he died of dysentery.<br />He give me the watch.
4067464 4071071 I hid this uncomfortable<br />hunk of metal up my ass two years.
4071096 4079085 Then, after seven years, I was<br />sent home to my family and now,
4081841 4084480 little man, I give the watch to you.
4107817 4109433 It's time, Butch.
4117822 4123734 In the heavyweight division, in<br />the right corner wearing the blue trunks,
4123759 4126253 weighing 210 pounds,
4126950 4130082 Floyd Ray Wilson!
4132923 4135693 It's official. It's official.<br />Wilson is dead!
4135717 4137604 Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest,
4137629 4139876 hands down, the most brutal fight<br />this city's ever seen.
4139890 4143563 Coolidge was out of there faster than I've<br />ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.
4143588 4144958 Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
4144982 4146313 My guess would be yes.
4146338 4150475 I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way<br />to the realization of what he was doing.
4150500 4152625 I think any man would've left<br />the ring that fast.
4152648 4155941 Do you feel this tragedy is<br />gonna affect the world of boxing?
4155966 4159581 A tragedy like this can't help but shake<br />the world of boxing to its very foundations.
4159618 4161904 But it's of paramount importance,<br />during the sad weeks ahead,
4161928 4163530 the eyes of the W.B.A. remain-
4199427 4201270 Man, you know I didn't...
4201295 4202633 Marsellus.
4202657 4205838 No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.<br />I didn't do it.
4205863 4207292 How you doing?
4207685 4210962 Great. I never thanked you for dinner.
4213366 4215062 - What you got?<br />- He booked.
4215087 4216258 His trainer?
4216300 4218565 Says he don't know nothin'. I believe him.
4218938 4220441 I think Butch surprised<br />his ass same as us.
4220466 4223390 No, we don't wanna "think". We wanna know.
4223432 4225857 Take him to the kennel,<br />sic the dogs on his ass.
4225882 4228488 We'll find out for goddamn sure<br />what he knows and what he don't.
4228513 4230583 Butch's search...<br />How do you want it done?
4230789 4233727 I'm prepared to scour the Earth<br />for that motherfucker.
4233752 4235568 If Butch goes to lndochina,
4235593 4239022 I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice<br />ready to pop a cap in his ass.
4239774 4241509 I will take care of it.
4252377 4253511 Mister.
4257276 4258580 Hey, mister.
4258783 4259769 What?
4259987 4263473 You were in that fight,<br />the fight on the radio.
4264487 4266188 You're the fighter?
4266573 4268157 Whatever gave you that idea?
4268419 4270161 No, come on.
4271766 4273077 You're him.
4273758 4275428 I know you're him.
4277566 4279083 Tell me you're him.
4279610 4280822 I'm him.
4282068 4284279 You killed the other boxing man.
4288443 4289792 He's dead?
4290405 4292342 The radio said he was dead.
4295776 4297760 Sorry about that, Floyd.
4299100 4301121 What does it feel like?
4301644 4303379 What does what feel like?
4303558 4305237 Killing a man.
4307447 4311372 Beating another man to death<br />with your bare hands.
4312078 4313596 What are you, a weirdo?
4313621 4317831 No. It is a subject<br />I have much interest in.
4320418 4324020 You are the first person I have ever met<br />who has killed somebody.
4327119 4328230 So?
4329488 4332204 What does it feel like to kill a man?
4333779 4335190 I'll tell you what.
4335605 4338814 Give me one of them cigarettes you got<br />up there, and I'll tell you all about it.
4357500 4360933 So, Esmarelda...
4362124 4365529 Villa Lobos... Is that Mexican?
4365554 4368788 The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian.
4368813 4370629 That's some handle you got there, honey.
4370653 4374240 Thank you.<br />And what is your name?
4374765 4375965 Butch.
4376396 4377521 Butch.
4378837 4379894 What does it mean?
4379919 4382328 I'm an American, honey.<br />Our names don't mean shit.
4383556 4390082 So, moving right along, Esmarelda,<br />what is it you want to know?
4390804 4393665 I want to know what it feels like<br />to kill a man.
4393690 4395105 I couldn't tell ya.
4401296 4403828 Didn't know he was dead<br />'til you told me he was dead.
4405680 4408579 Now that I know he's dead,<br />you wanna know how I feel about it?
4414372 4416652 I don't feel the least bit bad about it.
4428595 4430610 What the fuck'd I tell ya? Huh?
4430916 4434415 As soon as the word got out the fix was<br />in, man, the odds went through the roof.
4434440 4436736 I know. I know. Unbelievable.
4437237 4440469 Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was<br />a better boxer, he'd still be alive.
4440494 4441923 If he never laced up his gloves,
4441942 4444981 which he never shoulda done in the first<br />fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.
4446660 4450402 Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?<br />It's over now.
4450837 4453775 Yeah, well, enough about the poor,<br />unfortunate Mr. Floyd.
4453800 4456415 Let's talk about the rich<br />and prosperous Mr. Butch.
4457436 4459544 How many bookies did you<br />lay it around on?
4460415 4463143 All eight? How long to collect?
4464756 4466721 So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?
4466745 4469178 No, I understand. A few stragglers aside.
4469308 4473061 Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.<br />That is great news, man.
4473235 4477136 Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne<br />are gonna leave in the morning.
4477553 4480488 It'll probably take us a couple days<br />to get down to Knoxville.
4480779 4482715 Okay, my brother.
4483839 4486733 You're right. You're goddamn right.
4487226 4490721 All right, Scotty, next time I see you,<br />it'll be on Tennessee time.
4490844 4492238 Cool, brother.
4508249 4509892 $45.60.
4514796 4519689 And, uh,<br />here's a little something for the effort.
4520729 4523806 Now, if anybody asks you who your fare<br />was tonight, what are you gonna say?
4523831 4525212 The truth.
4525237 4528733 Three well-dressed,<br />slightly toasted Mexicans.
4531190 4533331 Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos.
4533545 4536073 Buenas Noches, Butch.
4547480 4548743 Whew.
4550592 4552376 Keep the light off.
4553281 4555506 - Is that better, Sugar Pop?<br />- Oui.
4560092 4562028 Hard day at the office?
4562053 4563322 Pretty hard.
4563953 4565650 Got in a fight.
4566416 4567994 Poor baby.
4568680 4570704 Can you make spoons?
4571280 4573453 You know what?<br />I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.
4573480 4575364 I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
4575388 4577211 I like the way you stink.
4578476 4580603 Let me take this jacket off.
4582890 4585224 I was looking at myself in the mirror.
4585249 4586422 Uh-huh.
4586534 4588223 I wish I had a pot.
4590032 4593324 You were looking at yourself in the<br />mirror, and you wish you had some pot?
4593349 4596613 A pot. A pot belly.
4597160 4598932 Pot bellies are sexy.
4599472 4604119 Well, you should be happy,<br />'cause you have one.
4604144 4607164 Shut up, fatso. I don't have a pot.
4607372 4611310 I have a bit of a tummy,<br />like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star".
4611335 4612997 It's not the same thing.
4613030 4615959 I didn't know there was such a difference<br />between a pot belly and a tummy.
4615984 4618096 The difference is huge.
4620431 4622616 Would you like it if I had a pot belly?
4622641 4623990 No.
4624402 4628631 Pot bellies make a man<br />look either oafish or like a gorilla.
4628970 4631993 But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy.
4632336 4638347 The rest of you is normal... normal face,<br />normal legs, normal hips, normal ass,
4638353 4642120 but with a big, perfectly round pot belly.
4642530 4646309 If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt<br />two sizes too small to accentuate it.
4646677 4649114 You think men would find that attractive?
4649545 4652362 I don't give a damn<br />what men find attractive.
4652797 4656437 It's unfortunate what we find pleasing<br />to the touch and pleasing to the eye
4656462 4658121 is seldom the same.
4661625 4665224 If you had a pot belly,<br />I would punch you in it.
4665249 4667934 - You'd punch me in the belly?<br />- Right in the belly.
4667955 4674167 Oh! I'd smother you! I'd drop it right<br />on your face 'til you couldn't breathe!
4674192 4676248 - You'd do that?<br />- Yeah.
4676273 4677757 - Promise?<br />- Yeah.
4692771 4694242 Did you get everything?
4694267 4696879 - Yes, I did.<br />- Good job, Sugar Pop.
4697406 4699342 Did everything go as planned?
4699616 4701225 You didn't listen to the... Ow!
4702202 4703896 You didn't listen to the radio?
4703921 4707223 I never listen to your fights.<br />Were you the winner?
4707600 4709415 I won, all right.
4709551 4712403 - Are you still retiring?<br />- Sure am.
4713230 4715240 So it all worked out in the finish.
4716344 4718529 We're not at the finish yet, baby.
4727841 4730169 We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?
4732342 4734735 If they find us, they'll kill us,<br />won't they?
4737300 4739368 But they won't find us, will they?
4743076 4745303 Do you still want me to go with you?
4747454 4751078 I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance.<br />It's...
4757857 4759562 Say it.
4761053 4762265 Fabienne,
4762962 4765047 I want you to be with me.
4766213 4767476 Forever?
4767501 4769133 Forever and ever.
4771240 4772919 Do you love me?
4773308 4775120 Very, very much.
4781340 4782525 Butch.
4782728 4783760 Yes?
4785077 4787674 Will you give me oral pleasure?
4789164 4790756 Will you kiss it?
4793129 4794783 But you first.
4795603 4797477 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
4808245 4809990 Butch.
4810717 4814156 Mon amour. L'aventure commence.
4829921 4831912 I think I cracked a rib.
4832188 4833927 Giving me oral pleasure?
4833951 4835742 No, retard, from the fight.
4835767 4837145 Don't call me "retard".
4837169 4839014 My name is Fabby.
4839039 4841731 - My name is Fabienne!<br />- Stop it.
4841756 4843002 - Stop it!<br />- My name is Fabi-
4843027 4846411 Shut up, fuckhead!<br />I hate that mongoloid voice.
4846436 4849533 Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
4850318 4851700 I take it back.
4854875 4857813 Will you hand me a dry towel,<br />Miss Beautiful Tulip?
4857838 4861680 Oh, I like that.<br />I like being called a tulip.
4861705 4863976 "Tulip" is much better than "mongoloid".
4864001 4866939 I didn't call you a mongoloid.<br />I called you a retard.
4867229 4868903 And I took it back.
4870326 4871437 Butch?
4871608 4873121 Yes, Lemon Pie?
4873395 4874970 Where are we going to go?
4874994 4876570 Well, I'm not sure yet.
4877225 4878929 Wherever you want.
4879404 4883665 We're gonna get a lot of money from this,<br />but it ain't gonna be the kind of money
4883675 4886805 that we can live like hogs<br />in the fathouse forever.
4887638 4891491 I was thinking maybe we could go<br />down someplace in the South Pacific.
4892195 4895359 Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna<br />carry us a long way down there.
4895384 4898202 - If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?<br />- You betcha.
4898227 4900747 And if after a while you didn't dig that,
4900772 4904099 we could go someplace else.<br />Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.
4904488 4906394 But I do not speak Spanish.
4906411 4909215 Well, you do not speak Bora-Boran either.
4909363 4913510 Besides, Mexican's easy.<br />�Donde esta el zapateria?
4913534 4916353 - What does that mean?<br />- Where is the shoe store?
4916378 4918314 - �Donde esta-<br />- Spit, please.
4919829 4921949 �Donde esta el zapateria?
4921973 4923849 Excellent pronunciation.
4926009 4928578 You'll be my little mamacita in no time.
4929360 4931906 - �Que hora es?<br />- �Que hora es?
4931931 4934060 - What time is it?<br />- What time is it?
4934085 4935668 Time for bed.
4936829 4938628 Sweet dreams, jellybean.
4946592 4947875 Butch?
4954401 4956057 Never mind.
4965924 4969990 Merde! You startled me.<br />Did you have a bad dream?
4980464 4982150 What is this you're watching?
4983274 4986567 A motorcycle movie.<br />I'm not sure the name.
4988654 4990055 Are you watching it?
4990687 4991904 In a way.
4994084 4997086 It's a little early in the morning<br />for explosions and war.
5000491 5001762 What was it about?
5001786 5004348 How should I know?<br />You were the one watching it.
5004480 5007161 No, imbecile, what was your dream about?
5007314 5010584 I don't know. I don't remember.
5011459 5013645 It's really rare that I remember my dreams.
5013670 5016642 Well, let's look at the grumpy man<br />in the morning.
5019124 5021802 Why don't you get up<br />and we'll get some breakfast.
5021827 5023757 One more kiss, and I'll get up.
5026773 5028197 Satisfied?
5028964 5030008 Yep.
5031074 5034013 Get up, lazy bones!
5034038 5036716 Oh. God.
5038038 5039376 What time is it?
5039602 5041362 Almost nine in the morning.
5041745 5043731 What time does our train arrive?
5043823 5045001 Eleven.
5045685 5047470 You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast?
5047494 5049014 What, Lemon Pie?
5049965 5056173 I'm gonna order a big plate of<br />blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,
5056198 5059637 eggs over easy and five sausages.
5060230 5062027 Anything to drink with that?
5062052 5064189 Wow, that looks nice.
5065680 5071102 To drink, a tall glass of orange juice<br />and a black cup of coffee.
5071452 5074011 After that,<br />I'm going to have a slice of pie.
5074147 5075939 Pie for breakfast?
5076345 5079555 Any time of the day is a good time for pie.
5079928 5086030 Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes.<br />And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese.
5086262 5087920 Where's my watch?
5092795 5094221 It's there.
5095028 5096349 No, it's not.
5097171 5098196 Have you looked?
5098221 5100792 Yes, I've fuckin' looked.<br />What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?
5102083 5103779 You sure you got it?
5104595 5106591 Yes. Bedside table drawer.
5106616 5107890 On the little kangaroo?
5107900 5109767 Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.
5109792 5112280 Yeah, well, it's not here now.
5114044 5115664 Well, it should be.
5115866 5119900 Yes, it most definitely should be, but<br />it's not here now! So where the fuck is it?
5125487 5128926 Fabienne,<br />where's my father's fucking watch?
5131180 5134683 Do you have any idea what he had<br />to go through to get me that watch?
5134708 5137023 I don't have time to go into it,<br />but he went through a lot.
5137054 5138920 All this other shit<br />you could've set on fire,
5138945 5142994 but I specifically reminded you<br />not to forget the fucking watch.
5143936 5146532 Now think. Did you get it?
5147439 5148469 I believe so.
5148494 5152021 "You believe so"? What the fuck does<br />that mean? You either did or didn't get it.
5153388 5154952 Then I did.
5157009 5158382 Are you sure?
5160521 5161426 No.
5163504 5165527 Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
5165552 5167839 Motherfucker! Motherfuckin'-
5169168 5172431 Do you know how fucking stupid<br />you fucking are?
5172456 5173749 No!
5177359 5179001 It's not your fault.
5183933 5186094 You left it at the apartment.
5192202 5194668 If you left it at the apartment,<br />it's not your fault.
5197446 5199458 I had you bring a bunch of stuff.
5202841 5204440 I reminded you about it,
5204465 5208343 but I didn't illustrate<br />how personal the watch was to me.
5209578 5212584 If all I gave a fuck about was<br />the watch, I shoulda told you that.
5213999 5215880 You're not a mind reader.
5216494 5217834 Are you?
5228520 5230456 I-I'm sorry.
5230655 5233763 Don't be. Just means<br />I can't have breakfast with you.
5235177 5236926 Why does it mean that?
5239541 5242877 Because I gotta go back to my apartment<br />and get my watch.
5244038 5246277 Won't the gangsters<br />be looking for you there?
5246754 5249947 Well, that's what I'm gonna find out.
5250598 5254037 If they are, and I don't think<br />I can handle it,
5254062 5255182 then I'll split.
5255207 5260082 I saw your watch. I thought<br />I brought it. I'm so sorry.
5266141 5270880 Here's some money. Go out and get<br />those pancakes. Have a nice breakfast.
5270905 5273384 I'll take your Honda. I'll be back<br />before you can say "blueberry pie".
5273409 5274942 Blueberry pie.
5276780 5278429 Maybe not that fast.
5279095 5280748 But pretty fast. Okay?
5282157 5283625 - Bye.<br />- Bye.
5284283 5287236 Shit! Of all the fuckin' things<br />she could fuckin' forget,
5287261 5289171 she forgets my father's watch!
5289196 5293713 I specifically reminded her,<br />bedside table, on the kangaroo.
5294016 5297020 I said the words:<br />"Don't forget my father's watch."
5312682 5315548 Visit the Jackrabbit Slim's nearest you...
5454490 5456426 Lookin' good, Butch.
5645181 5647348 That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch.
5648085 5649851 They keep underestimatin' ya.
5682419 5683862 Motherfucker.
5695440 5697239 - Do you think he's dead?<br />- He's dead.
5697251 5699379 - Oh, my God.<br />- He's dead.
5709960 5712284 If you need someone to go to court,<br />I'll be glad to help.
5712309 5715998 That guy was a drunken maniac.<br />He hit you, then he crashed into that car.
5716425 5717470 Who?
5717795 5718752 Him.
5722801 5724783 I'll be damned.

5791376 5793252 Hold it right there, goddamn it.

5798611 5800297 You don't understand, man.
5800322 5801799 Toss the weapon.

5849484 5852052 Yeah, the spider just caught<br />a couple flies.
5900067 5904158 Nobody kills anybody in<br />my place of business except me or Zed.
5908283 5909775 That's Zed.
5922991 5925633 - I thought you said you waited for me.<br />- I did.
5931319 5933680 Then how come they're all beat up?
5934914 5937738 They did that to each other, man.<br />They came in fightin'.
5938334 5942189 Now, this 'un right here,<br />he was gonna shoot that one.
5942471 5945677 Is that right? You gonna shoot him, boy?
5946780 5947836 Huh?

5958356 5959466 Mmm.
5961465 5965474 Well, bring out the Gimp.
5966394 5968119 I think the Gimp's sleepin'.
5969030 5971925 Then I guess you'll just have to go<br />wake him up now, won't you?
6012325 6013714 Get up.
6027519 6029102 Get down.
6039499 6041838 Which one of 'em you wanna do first?

6428003 6433463 to go to work on the homes here<br />with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.

6439784 6442347 I ain't through with you by a damn sight!
6442372 6444758 I'm gonna get medieval on your ass.
6449055 6451303 I meant what now between me and you.
6456721 6458906 Oh, that "what now".
6460471 6463309 I tell you what now between me and you.
6466064 6468878 There is no me and you.

6492895 6497526 and Mr. "Soon-To-Be-Livin' The-Rest-<br />Of-His-Short-Ass-Life-ln-Agonizing-Pain"
6497551 6499027 rapist here.

6505395 6509271 You leave town tonight. Right now.
6510254 6516041 And when you gone, you stay gone,<br />or you be gone.
6517046 6519984 You lost all your L.A. privileges. Deal?
6522239 6523467 Deal.
6525384 6527320 Get your ass outta here.

6598185 6600819 Come on, baby. Come on.<br />Get your shit. We gotta go right now.
6600844 6602551 I was so worried. What about our bags?
6602576 6605025 Fuck the bags. If we don't split<br />right now, we'll miss the train.
6605050 6606565 Come on. I'll be downstairs.
6606590 6607530 Is everything well?
6607555 6609518 Just come on! No talking now!
6609543 6611495 A-Are we in danger?
6615219 6616850 Come on, honey!
6620108 6622143 Where did you get this motorcycle?
6622168 6625029 It's not a motorcycle, baby.<br />It's a chopper. Let's go.
6625053 6626701 What happened to my Honda?
6626726 6630496 I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that Honda.<br />Will you come on now, please?
6631010 6632867 Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go.
6637429 6638457 You're hurt?
6638482 6642110 No, no, I might've broken my nose.<br />It's no biggie. Come on. Hop on.
6642134 6643513 Baby, please, we-
6643538 6646476 Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!<br />Get on!
6648768 6651878 Oh, baby, I'm sorry.<br />Come here, come here.
6651903 6653373 I'm sorry.
6654112 6655112 I'm so sorry.
6655137 6658053 You were gone so long,<br />I started to think dreadful thoughts.
6658078 6660723 I didn't mean to worry you.<br />Everything's fine.
6660748 6662538 - How was your breakfast?<br />- It was good.
6662558 6664494 Did you get the blueberry pancakes?
6664519 6668007 They didn't have blueberry; I had to get<br />buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?
6668032 6670789 Honey, since I left you,<br />this has been, without a doubt,
6670822 6674482 the single weirdest fuckin' day<br />of my life. I'll tell you all about it.
6674508 6676999 Come on. Get on. Gotta go. Come on.
6677898 6679917 Butch, whose motorcycle is this?
6680153 6682301 - It's a chopper, baby.<br />- Whose chopper is this?
6682505 6684441 - Zed's.<br />- Who's Zed?
6684540 6687359 Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.
6703459 6705759 Yes, you did, Brett!
6705782 6709751 You tried to fuck him, and<br />Marsellus Wallace don't liked to be fucked
6709765 6712056 by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
6712081 6713554 Oh, God, please. I don't wanna die.
6713578 6715252 You read the Bible, Brett?
6715585 6716271 Yes!
6716295 6720352 Well, there's this passage I got memorized.<br />Sorta fits the occasion.
6720580 6723599 Ezekiel 25:17.
6724142 6728619 "The path of the righteous man<br />is beset on all sides
6728644 6733451 by the inequities of the selfish<br />and the tyranny of evil men.
6733810 6738781 Blessed is he who, in the name<br />of charity and good will,
6738806 6741835 shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness,
6741860 6747457 for he is truly his brother's keeper<br />and the finder of lost children.
6747482 6753940 And I will strike down upon thee with<br />great vengeance and furious anger
6753965 6758373 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy My brothers.
6758486 6762371 And you will know<br />My name is the Lord
6762387 6765621 when I lay My vengeance upon thee."
6774423 6776423 I'm fucked. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
6776448 6778729 - Is he a friend of yours?<br />- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.
6778754 6781500 Hmm? Oh.<br />Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.
6781525 6783719 Better tell him to shut up.<br />He's gettin' on my nerves.
6783735 6784473 Marvin.
6784498 6786315 Marvin. Marvin!
6786822 6788872 I'd knock that shit off if I was you.
6789422 6792505 Die, you motherfuckers! Die!
6820973 6824252 Why the fuck didn't you tell us<br />somebody was in the bathroom?
6824277 6829003 Slip your mind? Did you forget that someone<br />was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?
6829028 6832658 You see the size of that gun he fired<br />at us? It was bigger than him.
6838132 6840634 We should be fuckin' dead, man.
6840659 6842595 I know. We was lucky.
6842620 6845496 No, no, no, no. That shit wasn't luck.
6845637 6847239 Yeah, maybe.
6847995 6852058 This was divine intervention.<br />You know what divine intervention is?
6858630 6860424 I think so.
6860449 6863524 That means that God came down<br />from Heaven and stopped the bullets.
6863549 6865985 That's right.<br />That's exactly what it means.
6866010 6869149 God came down from Heaven<br />and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.
6870279 6872319 I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.
6872344 6874780 Don't do that.<br />Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!
6874805 6877018 What just happened here<br />was a fuckin' miracle!
6877042 6878825 Chill. This shit happens.
6878850 6881780 Wrong! Wrong.<br />This shit doesn't "just happen".
6882110 6885550 Do you want to continue<br />this theological discussion in a car
6885575 6887597 or in a jailhouse with the cops?
6887622 6889622 We should be fuckin' dead,<br />my friend!
6890098 6894546 What happened here was a miracle, and<br />I want you to fucking acknowledge it!
6894862 6899106 All right, it was a miracle.<br />Can we go now?
6906392 6909649 Let's go, nigger! Come on! Shit.
6912421 6913887 You ever seen that show Cops?
6913912 6916506 I was watching it one time,<br />and there was this cop on,
6916531 6920239 and he was talkin' about this gunfight<br />he had in the hallway with this guy, right?
6920264 6923981 He just unloaded on this guy and<br />nothin' happened. He didn't hit nothin'.
6924319 6926587 Okay? It was just him and this guy.
6926612 6930312 I mean, you know, it's,<br />it's freaky, but it happens.
6930514 6932939 Look. You wanna play blind man,<br />go walk with the shepherd,
6932963 6935344 but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.
6935668 6937150 What the fuck does that mean?
6937174 6938845 It means that's it for me.
6938870 6941239 From here on in,<br />you can consider my ass retired.
6941264 6942819 - Jesus Christ.<br />- Don't blaspheme.
6942853 6944634 - Goddamn it.<br />- I said, don't do that!
6944646 6946713 Hey, why are you fuckin'<br />freakin' out on us?
6946738 6949405 Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today.<br />I'm through.
6949430 6951444 Why don't you tell him<br />at the same time why?
6951468 6952510 Don't worry, I will.
6952535 6955003 Yeah. And I bet you $10,000<br />he laughs his ass off.
6955027 6956716 I don't give a damn if he does.
6957495 6960366 Marvin, what do you make of all this?
6960495 6962581 Man, I don't even have an opinion.
6962606 6966616 You gotta have an opinion. You think<br />God came down from Heaven and stopped-
6967894 6969233 What the fuck's happenin'?
6969267 6970833 - Aw, shit, man!<br />- Aw, man!
6970858 6972508 Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
6972532 6973901 Why the fuck'd you do that?
6973926 6975865 I didn't mean it. It was an accident.
6975890 6977989 Man, I seen some crazy-ass shit<br />in my time, but this...
6978013 6981854 Chill out, man! It was an accident.<br />We probably went over a bump or somethin'.
6981879 6983882 The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump.
6983907 6987366 I didn't mean to shoot<br />the son of a bitch. The gun went off.
6987391 6990966 Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on<br />a city street in broad daylight here!
6990991 6992873 - I don't believe it!<br />- Well, believe it now, motherfucker!
6992898 6996329 We gotta get this car off the road. Cops<br />notice shit like a car drenched in blood.
6996354 6999017 Just take it to a friendly place,<br />that's all!
6999041 7001779 This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus<br />ain't got no friendly places in the Valley.
7001804 7003934 Well, Jules,<br />this ain't my fuckin' town, man!
7003959 7004990 Shit!
7005507 7007913 - What you doing?<br />- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.
7007938 7011469 - Where's Toluca Lake?<br />- Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.
7011970 7014840 If Jimmie's ass ain't home,<br />I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,
7014865 7017310 'cause I ain't got no other partners<br />in 818.
7017754 7020107 Jimmie, how you doin', man? It's Jules.
7020312 7021514 Just listen up, man.
7021539 7025612 Me and my homeboy are in a car,<br />and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.
7025637 7027955 I need to use your garage<br />for a couple hours.
7029134 7032102 We gotta be real fuckin' delicate<br />with this Jimmie situation.
7032127 7035082 He's one remark away from<br />kickin' our asses out the door.
7035107 7036174 If he does, what do we do?
7036203 7038191 We ain't leavin'<br />'til we make a couple calls,
7038216 7041142 but I don't want it to reach that pitch.<br />Jimmie's a friend.
7041159 7044058 You don't come into your friend's house<br />and start tellin' him what's what.
7044079 7046408 Just tell him not to be abusive.
7046433 7048791 He kinda freaked out back there<br />when he saw Marvin.
7048816 7050364 Put yourself in his position.
7050388 7053893 It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.<br />He wasn't expectin' this shit.
7054297 7056778 We gotta remember here<br />who's doin' who a favor.
7056800 7061103 If that favor means I gotta take shit, he<br />can stick that favor straight up his ass.
7061118 7063972 Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd<br />you just do to his towel, man?
7063996 7065358 I was dryin' my hands!
7065392 7067484 - You're supposed to wash 'em first!<br />- You watched me wash 'em.
7067498 7068966 I watched you get 'em wet.
7068991 7071609 I was washin' 'em.<br />This shit's hard to get off.
7071634 7073712 Maybe if he'd had Lava<br />I coulda done a better job.
7073733 7075775 I used the same fuckin' soap you did,<br />and when I finished,
7075800 7078215 the towel didn't look like<br />no goddamn maxi-pad!
7078240 7080884 What if he was to come in here<br />and see his towel like this?
7080909 7084581 It's shit like this that's gonna bring<br />this situation to a head, man!
7086144 7089584 Look, I ain't threatenin' you<br />or nothin', all right?
7089609 7094153 You know I respect you and all. But just<br />don't put me in this position, all right?
7094178 7096877 All right. Fine. Fine.
7096915 7099259 Ask me nice like that, no problem.
7099768 7102571 Just go handle your friend.<br />Go ahead. I don't care.
7104582 7109580 Mmm! Goddamn, Jimmie!<br />This some serious gourmet shit.
7109860 7113632 Me and Vincent would've been satisfied<br />with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.
7113657 7114577 Right?
7114823 7118063 And he springs<br />this serious gourmet shit on us.
7118298 7120501 - What flavor is this?<br />- Knock it off, Julie.
7121246 7122126 What?
7122152 7124969 I don't need you to tell me<br />how fuckin' good my coffee is, okay?
7124994 7127305 I'm the one who buys it.<br />I know how good it is.
7127330 7129411 When Bonnie goes shopping,<br />she buys shit.
7129796 7133104 I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause<br />when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
7133126 7137189 But you know what's on my mind right<br />now? It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.
7137214 7139436 It's the dead nigger in my garage.
7139565 7140692 Jimmie, don't even worry-
7140717 7143435 Don't tell me about anything.<br />I wanna ask you a question.
7143455 7145054 When you came pulling in here,
7145079 7148199 did you notice the sign on the front of my<br />house that said, "Dead Nigger Storage"?
7148307 7149506 You know I ain't seen no-
7149530 7153776 Did you notice the sign on the front of my<br />house that said, "Dead Nigger Storage"?
7154368 7156798 No. I didn't.
7156823 7158791 You know why you didn't see that sign?
7159072 7159761 Why?
7159759 7162891 'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing<br />dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business,
7162916 7164034 that's why!
7164059 7165596 We're not gonna store the motherfucker-
7165617 7167408 Don't you fuckin' realize
7167433 7171598 that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead<br />body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?
7171623 7175268 No marriage counselor. No trial separation.<br />I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced. Okay?
7175293 7177845 And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced!
7178448 7183524 Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,<br />but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.
7183549 7185375 Jimmie, Jimmie,<br />she ain't gonna leave you.
7185400 7189872 Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!<br />Okay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.
7189897 7193159 There's nothin' you're gonna say that's<br />gonna make me forget I love my wife.
7193184 7194204 Is there?
7196291 7200982 Now, look, you know, she comes home<br />from work in about an hour and a half.
7201632 7204244 The graveyard shift at the hospital.
7204269 7207977 You gotta make some phone calls?<br />You gotta call some people?
7208040 7211980 Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck<br />out of my house before she gets here.
7212005 7214828 That's Kool and the Gang.<br />We don't wanna fuck your shit up.
7214853 7217751 All I wanna do is call my people<br />and get 'em to bring us in.
7217752 7220682 You don't wanna fuck my shit?<br />You're fucking my shit up right now!
7220707 7223393 You're gonna fuck my shit up big time<br />if Bonnie comes home.
7223599 7227345 Do me that favor, all right? The phone is<br />in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.
7227827 7229796 Well, say she comes home.
7230513 7232321 What do you think she'll do?
7234466 7239052 Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.<br />That ain't no kinda answer.
7239157 7242220 I mean, you know, I don't.<br />How much? A lot or a little?
7242755 7247234 You got to appreciate what an<br />explosive element this Bonnie situation is.
7247259 7251233 She comes home from a hard day's work,<br />finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen
7251258 7253105 doing a bunch of gangster shit,
7253130 7255616 there ain't no tellin'<br />what she's liable to do.
7258751 7263319 Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.<br />All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs.
7263344 7265559 I don't wanna hear about<br />no motherfuckin' ifs!
7265584 7267007 All I want to hear from your ass is,
7267031 7269762 "You ain't got no problem, Jules.<br />I'm on the motherfucker.
7269787 7274370 Chill them niggers out and wait for the<br />cavalry, which should be coming directly."
7274566 7279516 You ain't got no problem, Jules.<br />I'm on the motherfucker.
7279799 7285005 Chill them niggers out and wait for<br />the Wolf, who should be coming directly.
7286100 7287515 You sendin' the Wolf?
7288112 7289923 Oh, you feel better, motherfucker?
7290258 7294397 Shit, yeah, negro!<br />That's all you had to say!
7295391 7297360 She the hysterical type?
7298574 7300291 When is she due?
7301799 7303088 Mm-hmm.
7303778 7305714 Give me the principals' names again.
7305812 7307108 Place your bets.
7308830 7310159 Jules.
7310195 7311298 Cards, please.
7311311 7312471 Mm-hmm.
7312938 7314686 Vincent.
7319519 7321004 Jimmie.
7322554 7324736 Bonnie. Mm-hmm.
7329444 7332339 It's thirty minutes away.<br />I'll be there in ten.
7349858 7352796 You're... Jimmie, right?<br />This is your house?
7352821 7353739 It sure is.
7353763 7356508 I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.
7356644 7357696 Good. We got one.
7357720 7359354 So I heard. May I come in?
7359379 7361204 Uh, yeah. Please do.
7361514 7365279 You must be Jules.<br />Which would make you... Vincent.
7365304 7367472 Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.
7367497 7370397 If I was informed correctly, the clock<br />is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?
7370422 7371938 Uh, one hundred percent.
7371963 7375538 Your wife Bonnie comes home<br />at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?
7375535 7376579 Uh-huh.
7376604 7379458 I was led to believe<br />if she comes home and finds us here,
7379482 7381281 she wouldn't appreciate it much.
7381306 7382439 She wouldn't at that.
7382463 7386022 That gives us 40 minutes<br />to get the fuck outta Dodge,
7386047 7388933 which, if you do what I say,<br />when I say it, should be plenty.
7388958 7393380 Now, you got a corpse in a car,<br />minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.
7401296 7403232 - Jimmie.<br />- Uh-huh.
7403568 7405015 Do me a favor, will ya?
7405039 7407695 Thought I smelled some coffee<br />back there. Would you make me a cup?
7408563 7410024 Uh, yeah, sure.
7412196 7414719 Oh, uh, um, how do you take it?
7414744 7416745 Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
7419851 7422576 About the car, is there anything<br />I need to know? Does it stall?
7422601 7425611 Does it smoke? Does it make<br />a lot of noise? Is there gas in it?
7425636 7427779 Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.
7428314 7429367 Positive?
7429513 7432269 Don't get me on the road and I find out<br />the brake lights don't work.
7432307 7435105 As far as I know,<br />the motherfucker's tip-top.
7435717 7436707 Good enough.
7437515 7439362 Let's go back to the kitchen.
7445237 7447625 - Here you go, Mr. Wolf.<br />- Thank you, Jimmie.
7453168 7454602 Mmm.
7455862 7458096 Okay, first thing. You two.
7458542 7460555 Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
7460586 7463254 Jimmie, this looks to be<br />a pretty domesticated house.
7463279 7466824 That would lead me to believe<br />you got cleansers and shit.
7466848 7468116 Yeah. Under the sink.
7468141 7471336 Good. What I need you two fellas to do<br />is take those cleaning products
7471361 7475093 and clean the inside of the car.<br />I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.
7475118 7479312 Go in the back seat, scoop up all<br />those little pieces of brain and skull.
7479337 7482021 Get it out of there.<br />Wipe down the upholstery.
7482046 7485118 It don't need to be spick-and-span.<br />You don't need to eat off it.
7485143 7487143 Just give it a good once-over.
7487168 7489709 What you need to take care of<br />are the really messy parts.
7490088 7493532 The pools of blood that have collected,<br />you gotta soak that shit up.
7493557 7496406 Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet.
7496431 7499853 I need blankets,<br />I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.
7499878 7503369 The thicker the better, the darker<br />the better. No whites. Can't use 'em.
7503394 7508618 We'll need to camouflage the front seat<br />and back seat and floorboards
7508643 7510405 with quilts and blankets,
7510430 7514805 so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout<br />in the car, the subterfuge won't last,
7514830 7517292 but at a glance the car<br />will appear to be normal.
7517649 7518957 Jimmie, lead the way.
7518981 7520157 Boys, get to work.
7520605 7521947 "Please" would be nice.
7523076 7524192 Come again?
7524216 7526014 I said, a "please" would be nice.
7527907 7530188 Get it straight, buster.<br />I'm not here to say please.
7530212 7531881 I'm here to tell you what to do.
7533268 7535594 And if self-preservation<br />is an instinct you possess,
7535619 7537890 you'd better fuckin' do it<br />and do it quick.
7538996 7542787 I'm here to help. If my help's<br />not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.
7542812 7546410 No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;<br />your help is definitely appreciated.
7546414 7549758 Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean disrespect,<br />okay? I respect you.
7549778 7552579 I just don't like people<br />barkin' orders at me.
7552604 7555322 If I'm curt with you,<br />it's because time is a factor.
7555347 7557160 I think fast, I talk fast,
7557184 7559953 and I need you guys to act fast<br />if you wanna get out of this.
7560258 7563646 So pretty please, with sugar on top,<br />clean the fuckin' car.
7568207 7571519 Don't be lookin' at me like that,<br />all right? I can feel your look.
7574549 7576962 It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
7579059 7580275 Green.
7582749 7584762 Nothin' except for the mess inside.
7587980 7590334 Mmm, about 20 minutes.
7591925 7593701 Nobody who'll be missed.
7595889 7598771 You're a good man, Joe. Thanks a bunch.
7599976 7601027 How we comin', Jimmie?
7601052 7604618 Pretty good. I got it all here, but, uh,
7605325 7607382 - Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.<br />- Winston.
7607391 7608813 Jimmie, please. Winston.
7608838 7612014 Okay. You gotta<br />understand something, uh, Winston.
7612210 7614199 Uh- Uh, no, thank you.
7614224 7617588 Uh, this is our best linen here,
7617613 7622605 and it's, uh, it was a wedding present<br />from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny.
7622630 7624681 They're not with us anymore. I wanna help-
7624705 7626734 Let me ask you a question, Jimmie.
7627631 7630078 - If you don't mind.<br />- No, no, please. Go ahead.
7632039 7636977 Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,<br />were they millionaires?
7637999 7639207 No.
7639589 7641901 Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.
7642552 7646013 And I'm positive that if<br />Uncle Conrad and Aunt...
7646230 7646871 Ginny.
7646896 7653041 Ginny were here, they would<br />furnish you with a whole bedroom set,
7653066 7655767 which your Uncle Marsellus<br />is more than happy to do.
7660076 7664016 I like oak myself.<br />That's what I have in my bedroom.
7664980 7666916 How about you, Jimmie?
7668302 7669873 You an oak man?
7671313 7672630 Oak's nice.
7679198 7683070 Oh, man, I will never<br />forgive your ass for this shit.
7683092 7685303 This is some fucked-up, repugnant shit.
7685328 7688901 Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy<br />that once a man admits he is wrong,
7688926 7691995 that he is immediately forgiven for all<br />wrongdoings? Have you ever heard that?
7692020 7694005 Get the fuck out my face<br />with that shit!
7694030 7696983 The motherfucker that said that shit never<br />had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull
7697008 7698561 on account of your dumb ass.
7698585 7701812 I got a threshold, Jules,<br />for the abuse that I will take.
7701837 7704828 Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,<br />and you got me in the red.
7704853 7708721 I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous<br />to have a race car in the fuckin' red.
7708746 7710842 That's all. I could blow.
7710867 7713041 - Oh, you ready to blow?<br />- Yeah, I'm ready to blow.
7713046 7715950 Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'<br />motherfucker, motherfucker.
7715975 7719152 Every time my fingers touch brain,<br />I'm Superfly T.N.T.
7719177 7721113 I'm the Guns of the Navarone.
7721138 7723570 In fact, what the fuck<br />am I doin' in the back?
7723595 7726969 You're the motherfucker should be on<br />brain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'.
7726994 7730125 I'm washin' windows, and you're<br />pickin' up this nigger's skull!
7739754 7741565 Fine job, gentlemen.
7742691 7744735 You may get out of this yet.
7744760 7746961 I can't believe this is the same car.
7747172 7750612 Well, let's not start suckin'<br />each other's dicks quite yet.
7750983 7754555 Phase one is complete: Clean the car,<br />which moves us right along to Phase two:
7754580 7755993 Clean you two.
7758878 7760220 Strip.
7760420 7763025 - All the way?<br />- To your bare ass.
7764216 7766054 Quickly, gentlemen.
7766079 7770232 We got about 15 minutes before Jimmie's<br />better half comes pulling into the driveway.
7770257 7772750 Goddamn, this morning air<br />is some chilly shit.
7772775 7774940 Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
7774965 7777166 - You know what you two look like?<br />- What?
7777191 7779821 Like a couple of guys<br />who just blew off somebody's head.
7780704 7784074 Strippin' off those bloody rags<br />is absolutely necessary.
7788497 7790409 Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.
7790434 7791623 Don't do nothin' stupid,
7791647 7795130 like leavin' this shit out front<br />for the garbageman to pick up.
7795212 7797013 Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
7797256 7799366 Jim, the soap.
7801301 7802043 Vincent.
7802068 7803338 Okay, gentlemen.
7803450 7806610 You both been to County before, I'm sure.<br />Here it comes.
7806884 7809527 - Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!<br />- Yo! Yo! Yo!
7809552 7811490 Better you than me, gentlemen.
7813430 7816066 Don't be afraid of the soap.<br />Spread it around.
7816108 7817397 Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's hair.
7817412 7819241 Hey, get out of my hair!
7819266 7821278 Come on. Do it, goddamn it! Do it!
7822903 7824113 Towel.
7835611 7837866 You're dry enough. Toss 'em their clothes.
7840304 7841614 Perfect.
7842017 7844738 Perfect.<br />We couldn't have planned this better.
7845500 7847436 You guys look like...
7847803 7849830 What do they look like, Jimmie?
7850122 7853882 Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.
7854771 7857243 Ha-ha-ha. They're your clothes,<br />motherfucker.
7857268 7860049 Come on, gentlemen.<br />We're laughing our way right into prison.
7860068 7861441 Don't make me beg.
7864979 7868327 Okay, gentlemen,<br />let's get our rules of the road straight.
7868352 7871172 We're going to a place<br />called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.
7871665 7875295 Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel<br />are sympathetic to our dilemma.
7875530 7877335 The place is North Hollywood,
7877360 7880513 so a few twists and turns aside,<br />we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.
7881179 7884669 Now, I'll drive the tainted car.<br />Jules, you ride with me.
7886011 7887947 Vincent, you follow in my Acura.
7887967 7891907 Now, if we come across the path<br />of any John Q. Laws,
7891932 7894681 nobody does a fuckin' thing<br />'til I do something, right?
7894686 7895998 What did I say?
7896232 7897967 Don't do shit unless.
7897992 7900439 - Unless what?<br />- Unless you do it first.
7900543 7902744 Spoken like a true prodigy.
7902852 7906583 How about you, Lash LaRue? Can you<br />keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?
7906608 7910708 The gun went off. I don't know why.<br />I'm cool. I promise you.
7910733 7913763 Fair enough. Now, I drive real<br />fuckin' fast, so keep up.
7913788 7916320 If get my car back<br />any different than I gave it,
7916345 7919022 Monster Joe's gonna be<br />disposing of two bodies.
7922673 7924292 Outta my way, Rex.
7926226 7927466 We cool?
7927490 7928908 Like it never happened.
7929344 7930329 All right.
7930354 7935334 Boys, this is Raquel.<br />Someday all this will be hers.
7935435 7938341 Hi. So, what's with the outfits?
7938575 7940835 You guys going to<br />a volleyball game or something?
7942924 7945012 I'm takin' milady out for breakfast.
7945099 7947238 Maybe I could drop you two off.<br />Where do you live?
7947263 7948630 - Redondo.<br />- Inglewood.
7948805 7954610 It's... It's your future. I...<br />I see a... a cab ride.
7954883 7956797 Move outta the sticks, fellas.
7956822 7958181 Say good night, Raquel.
7958206 7959374 Good night, Raquel.
7959398 7962796 I'll see you guys around.<br />Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.
7962821 7966672 Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was<br />a real pleasure watching you work.
7966697 7969517 Yeah, really.<br />And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.
7970719 7972114 Call me Winston.
7973888 7976674 You see that, young lady? Respect.
7976977 7979360 Respect for one's elders shows character.
7979384 7981113 I have character.
7981352 7985238 Because you are a character<br />doesn't mean that you have character.
7993124 7994872 Wanna share a cab?
7995333 7998715 I'd go for some breakfast.<br />Feel like havin' breakfast with me?
7999082 8000351 Cool.
8006223 8008948 I don't know why, I just thought<br />he'd be European or something.
8008973 8011019 Yeah, he's about as European<br />as fuckin' English Bob.
8011043 8012437 I know that now.
8012462 8014383 - But was he cool or what?<br />- Thank you.
8014408 8017204 Totally fuckin' cool, in control.
8017736 8021716 Didn't even really get pissed when you<br />were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.
8023264 8024613 Want some bacon?
8024638 8026574 No, man, I don't eat pork.
8026607 8027709 Are you Jewish?
8027736 8030162 I ain't Jewish.<br />I just don't dig on swine, that's all.
8030197 8031360 Why not?
8031562 8034665 Pigs are filthy animals.<br />I don't eat filthy animals.
8034690 8038353 Yeah, but bacon tastes good.<br />Pork chops taste good.
8038378 8040466 Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,
8040499 8043287 but I'd never know 'cause<br />I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers.
8044340 8047771 Pigs sleep and root in shit.<br />That's a filthy animal.
8047796 8051033 I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got<br />sense enough to disregard its own feces.
8051148 8053801 What about a dog? Dog eats its own feces.
8053825 8055486 I don't eat dog either.
8055958 8058715 Yeah, but do you consider a dog<br />to be a filthy animal?
8059309 8063514 I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog<br />filthy, but they're definitely dirty.
8063689 8066910 But a dog's got personality.<br />Personality goes a long way.
8066934 8068610 Ah, so, by that rationale,
8068635 8073124 if a pig had a better personality, he would<br />cease to be a filthy animal. Is that true?
8073148 8076164 We'd have to be talkin' about<br />one charming motherfuckin' pig.
8076322 8079843 I mean, he'd have to be ten times more<br />charming than that Arnold on Green Acres.
8085766 8087895 Oh, man, that's good.
8087920 8090646 That's good, man.<br />You're startin' to lighten up.
8091696 8093864 You've been sittin' there,<br />all serious and shit.
8094093 8096953 - I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.<br />- About what?
8097102 8098902 About the miracle we witnessed.
8099272 8102088 Miracle you witnessed.<br />I witnessed a freak occurrence.
8102226 8103771 What is a miracle, Vincent?
8105586 8108418 - Act of God.<br />- And what's an act of God?
8112266 8116104 When, um, God makes<br />the impossible possible.
8117154 8121070 But this morning, I don't think qualifies.
8121094 8125727 Hey, Vincent. See, that shit don't matter.<br />You're judging this shit the wrong way.
8126001 8130821 It could be God stopped the bullets,<br />changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.
8131128 8133700 You don't judge shit like this<br />based on merit.
8133789 8135702 Now, whether or not what we experienced
8135727 8139277 was an according-to-Hoyle miracle<br />is insignificant.
8139298 8143508 But what is significant is,<br />I felt the touch of God.
8143533 8145061 God got involved.
8145878 8147110 But why?
8147579 8150129 Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:<br />I don't know why.
8150154 8151809 But I can't go back to sleep.
8151833 8155301 You're serious. You're<br />really thinkin' about quittin'.
8155326 8156874 - For life?<br />- Yeah.
8156907 8158002 Most definitely.
8158027 8161398 Fuck. What you gonna do then?
8162544 8166179 Well, that's what I been<br />sitting here contemplating.
8166863 8170238 First I'm gonna deliver this case<br />to Marsellus.
8170671 8173553 Then, basically,<br />I'm just gonna walk the Earth.
8173578 8175312 What you mean, "walk the Earth"?
8175336 8177323 You know, like Caine in Kung Fu.
8177348 8180265 Walk from place to place,<br />meet people, get in adventures.
8180290 8182680 And how long do you intend<br />to walk the Earth?
8182705 8184775 'Til God puts me where He wants me to be.
8184799 8186210 What if He don't do that?
8186228 8188371 If it takes forever,<br />then I'll walk forever.
8189277 8191134 So you decided to be a bum.
8191266 8194319 I'll just be Jules, Vincent.<br />No more, no less.
8194330 8196879 No, Jules, you decided to be a bum,
8196904 8200206 just like all those pieces of shit<br />out there who beg for change,
8200231 8203169 who sleep in garbage bins,<br />eat what I throw away.
8203194 8206151 They got a name for that, Jules.<br />It's called a bum.
8206156 8210127 And without a job, a residence or legal<br />tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.
8210169 8212105 You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.
8212130 8214864 Look, my friend,<br />this is just where you and I differ.
8214889 8217906 Gar�on, coffee!
8217931 8222385 Jules, look, what happened this morning,<br />man, I agree it was peculiar.
8222410 8225426 - But water into wine, I...<br />- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.
8225600 8227282 Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.
8227306 8231313 If my answers frighten you, then<br />you should cease asking scary questions.
8234483 8236231 I'm gonna take a shit.
8240519 8242109 Let me ask you something.
8242134 8243567 When did you make this decision?
8243591 8245348 When you were sittin' there<br />eatin' that muffin?
8245373 8249133 Yeah. I was sittin' here<br />eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,
8249158 8250928 replayin' the incident in my head,
8250953 8254757 when I had what alcoholics refer to<br />as a moment of clarity.
8255616 8258277 Fuck. To be continued.
8270144 8271648 I love you, Pumpkin.
8271675 8273310 I love you, Honey Bunny.
8274733 8276842 Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!
8276867 8279675 Any one of you fucking pricks move,
8279688 8282910 and I'll execute<br />every one of you motherfuckers!
8282935 8284511 - You got that?<br />- Waitresses on the floor!
8284536 8286330 You just be quiet over there!
8286355 8289419 Get on the fuckin'-<br />Get the fuck down!
8289444 8294123 You're in a blind spot. Take your dames<br />over to that booth, on the count of ten!
8294127 8295681 Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!
8295706 8298627 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...
8299061 8301645 What the fuck are you doing,<br />you fucking yuppie? Get down!
8302845 8304490 - Get down!<br />- Throw those bags!
8304515 8306333 Fucking move! Move!
8307925 8309643 Move! Get the fuck-
8310681 8312436 Get down on the fucking floor!
8312461 8314397 Grandpa! Down!
8314422 8318020 I'm the manager here,<br />and there's no problem. No problem at all.
8318045 8320983 - You gonna give me a problem?<br />- No, sir, I'm not.
8320988 8324326 Thought you said you were gonna<br />give me a fucking problem!
8326201 8328128 I think we got a hero here, Honey Bunny.
8328139 8330067 Well, just execute him!
8330961 8333490 I am not a hero. I'm just<br />a coffee shop manager.
8333515 8334962 Get the fuck down!
8334987 8336752 The restaurant's ours!
8336777 8338994 Just take whatever you want.
8340076 8341862 - You talk to the customers.<br />- Yeah.
8341887 8345097 You tell them to be fucking cool<br />and everything will be over.
8345122 8346836 - You understand me?<br />- Yes!
8349178 8350976 Listen, everybody.
8351197 8356420 Be calm, cooperate, and<br />this'll all be over in a minute!
8356445 8358415 Get the fuck down! Well done.
8370395 8373888 All right, now, people, gonna<br />come around and collect your wallets!
8373913 8377375 You don't fucking talk. You just<br />throw 'em in the bag! Are we clear?
8377714 8379782 I said, are we fucking clear?
8380062 8382430 Good! Now, wallets out!
8383125 8386513 That's it. Get the fuck down. In the bag.
8386742 8389722 - In the fucking bag!<br />- I don't have nothin' on me, man.
8389747 8391120 In the bag.
8391842 8394561 What am I waiting for?<br />In the fucking bag.
8394586 8397524 Laura. Laura. Tips. In the bag.
8398660 8400038 - Is that a cellular phone?<br />- Yeah.
8400063 8401656 In the fucking bag.
8403407 8406509 Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.<br />Now get the fuck down on the floor.
8406872 8409291 In the bag. In the bag.
8421924 8423223 In the bag.
8438991 8441616 - What's in the case?<br />- My boss's dirty laundry.
8441641 8444119 - Your boss makes you do his laundry?<br />- When he wants it clean.
8444144 8445189 Sounds like a shit job.
8445213 8447118 Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.
8447143 8448307 Open it.
8448541 8450072 'Fraid I can't do that.
8452027 8453014 I didn't hear you.
8453038 8454200 Yes, you did.
8455360 8456949 What's going on?
8457580 8459751 Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.
8459775 8461265 Shoot him in the face!
8461370 8462619 I hate to shatter your ego,
8462643 8465029 but this ain't the first time<br />I've had a gun pointed at me.
8465054 8467236 If you don't take your hand off that case,<br />it'll be your last.
8467260 8469478 Stop causing problems!<br />You'll get us all killed!
8469503 8471468 Give 'em what you got<br />and get 'em outta here!
8471493 8474542 Shut the fuck up, fat man!<br />This ain't none of your goddamn business!
8475811 8480053 Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.<br />No problem. I got it under control.
8481688 8483681 Now, I'm gonna count to three.
8485413 8489165 If you don't open that case,<br />I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.
8493617 8494979 We clear?
8498928 8500055 One.
8503370 8504505 Two.
8505879 8507229 - Three.<br />- Okay, Ringo.
8507437 8510218 You win. It's yours.
8516430 8517630 Open it.
8522197 8523636 Hey, what is it?
8524606 8525956 What is it?
8527816 8529405 Is that what I think it is?
8529430 8530421 Mm-hmm.
8534205 8535498 It's beautiful.
8535523 8537914 Goddamn it, what is it?
8540240 8542871 You let him go! You let him go!
8542896 8545580 - Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!<br />- Tell that bitch to be cool.
8545587 8547556 - Say, "Bitch, be cool!"<br />- Be cool, Honey Bunny!
8547581 8549049 Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
8549082 8551630 - Tell that bitch to chill!<br />- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!
8551655 8553326 Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
8553336 8554763 - Chill out, Honey Bunny!<br />- Let go of him!
8554784 8556477 - Chill!<br />- Chill out, Honey Bunny!
8556506 8558567 - Now tell her it's gonna be alright.<br />- It's gonna be alright.
8558592 8559605 - Promise her!<br />- I promise!
8559630 8561667 - Tell her to chill!<br />- Chill out, Honey Bunny!
8561692 8562886 Now tell me her name.
8562910 8563669 Yolanda.
8563694 8567082 All right, now, Yolanda, we're not<br />gonna do anything stupid, are we?
8567100 8569981 - Don't you hurt him!<br />- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!
8569978 8573740 We're all gonna be like three little<br />Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?
8574923 8576826 Come on, Yolanda! What's Fonzie like?
8576851 8577616 He's cool.
8577641 8578928 - What?<br />- Cool.
8578953 8584179 Correctamundo. And that's what<br />we're gonna be. We're gonna be cool.
8584534 8588414 Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three.
8589435 8593688 And when I count three,<br />I want you to let go of your gun,
8593713 8597724 put your palms flat on the table<br />and sit your ass down.
8598817 8602459 And when you do it, you do it cool.
8603167 8604485 You ready?
8605467 8606709 One,
8607628 8608846 two,
8610008 8611053 three.
8619901 8621421 Okay, now you let him go!
8621446 8623624 Yolanda! I thought you were gonna be cool.
8623664 8625882 Now, when you yell at me,<br />it makes me nervous.
8625907 8628114 When I get nervous, I get scared.
8628139 8632353 When motherfuckers get scared, that's<br />when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.
8633677 8637309 Just know, you hurt him, you die.
8638022 8640349 Well, that seems to be the situation.
8640708 8644503 But I don't want that.<br />And you don't want that.
8644528 8647508 And Ringo here definitely<br />doesn't want that.
8647533 8649295 So let's see what we can do.
8651136 8654737 Now... here's the situation.
8655705 8659107 Normally both your asses would be<br />dead as fuckin' fried chicken,
8659132 8662103 but you happened to pull this shit<br />while I'm in a transitional period,
8662128 8664597 and I don't wanna kill you;<br />I wanna help you.
8664664 8668672 But I can't give you this case,<br />'cause it don't belong to me.
8669323 8672395 Besides, I been through too much shit<br />over this case this morning
8672420 8674875 to just hand it over to your dumb ass.
8675873 8677107 Vincent!
8677132 8678413 - Be cool!<br />- Get back!
8679012 8683498 Yolanda, it's cool, baby.<br />It's cool! We still just talkin'.
8683523 8686163 Come on. Point the gun at me.<br />Point the gun at me.
8686187 8687542 There you go.
8687567 8691889 Now, Vincent, you just hang back<br />and don't do a goddamn thing.
8691914 8693508 Tell her it's still cool.
8694286 8696895 - It's still cool, Honey Bunny.<br />- How we doin', baby?
8698207 8700309 I-I gotta go pee.
8700967 8702383 I wanna go home.
8702408 8707325 Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.<br />And Ringo's proud of you. It's almost over.
8707591 8709017 Tell her you're proud of her.
8709635 8711121 I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
8711276 8712669 I love you.
8712841 8714478 I love you too, Honey Bunny.
8714502 8720276 Now, I want you to go in that bag<br />and find my wallet.
8722686 8723861 Which one is it?
8723891 8726319 It's the one that says "Bad Motherfucker".
8740876 8744089 That's it.<br />That's my bad motherfucker.
8744114 8746299 Open it up. Take out the money.
8752354 8753727 Count it.
8760270 8761847 How much is there?
8765041 8766615 About 1,500 dollars.
8766640 8769022 Okay, put it in your pocket.<br />It's yours.
8769918 8772755 Now, with the rest of those wallets<br />and the register,
8772780 8775022 that makes this a pretty successful<br />little score, huh?
8775047 8777361 Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod<br />1,500 dollars,
8777385 8779021 and I'll shoot him on general principle.
8779046 8782124 No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna<br />do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!
8782149 8784244 Vince, shut the fuck up!
8785015 8787589 - Shut up!<br />- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.
8789072 8793730 Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent.<br />I'm buyin' something for my money.
8795029 8796932 Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
8797159 8798190 What?
8798370 8802872 Your life. I'm givin' you that money<br />so I don't have to kill your ass.
8804285 8805979 You read the Bible, Ringo?
8807010 8808783 Not regularly, no.
8808808 8811279 Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
8811555 8813908 Ezekiel 25:17.
8815023 8817859 "The path of the righteous man<br />is beset on all sides
8817884 8821999 by the inequities of the selfish<br />and the tyranny of evil men.
8822466 8825408 Blessed is he who,<br />in the name of charity and good will,
8825433 8827710 shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness,
8827735 8831580 for he is truly his brother's keeper<br />and the finder of lost children.
8832082 8836512 And I will strike down upon thee with<br />great vengeance and furious anger
8836537 8839600 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy My brothers.
8840175 8845386 And you will know I am the Lord<br />when I lay My vengeance upon you."
8847178 8852619 I been sayin' that shit for years,<br />and if you heard it, that meant your ass.
8853984 8856074 I never gave much thought<br />to what it meant.
8856099 8859135 I just thought it was some<br />coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker
8859160 8861136 before I popped a cap in his ass.
8861346 8864084 But I saw some shit this morning<br />made me think twice.
8865065 8868761 See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means
8868786 8872894 you're the evil man,<br />and I'm the righteous man,
8872919 8875065 and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
8875083 8878648 he's the shepherd protecting<br />my righteous ass in the valley of darkness.
8879558 8885106 Or it could mean you're the righteous man,<br />and I'm the shepherd,
8885131 8888499 and it's the world that's evil and selfish.
8888995 8890930 Now, I'd like that.
8891403 8893590 But that shit ain't the truth.
8894572 8896323 The truth is,
8897682 8899708 you're the weak...
8900609 8903770 ...and I'm the tyranny of evil men.
8905443 8907379 But I'm tryin', Ringo.
8908742 8913524 I'm tryin' real hard...<br />to be the shepherd.
8929335 8930574 Go.
8949513 8951537 I think we should be leaving now.
8951904 8954232 Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
