30072 34201 Forget it. It's too risky.<br />I'm through doing that shit.
34284 36745 You always say that.<br />The same thing every time.
36828 39748 “I'm through, never again, too dangerous.”
39831 42084 I know that's what I always say.<br />I'm always right too.
42167 45796 - You forget about it in a day or two.<br />- The days of me forgetting are over.
45879 47673 The days of me remembering<br />have just begun.
47756 50175 You know, when you go on like this,<br />what you sound like?
50259 53136 - I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.<br />- You sound like a duck.
53220 54680 Quack, quack, quack.
54763 56848 Take heart, 'cause you're never<br />gonna have to hear it again.
56932 60394 Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're<br />never gonna have to hear me quack.
60477 63730 - After tonight?<br />- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
64773 68110 - Can I get anyone more coffee?<br />- Oh, yes!
69945 72489 - Thank you.<br />- You're welcome.
73824 77536 I mean, the way it is now, you're takin'<br />the same risk as when you rob a bank.
78370 80664 Takin' more of a risk. Banks are easier.
80747 83542 Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you<br />in any way during a robbery.
83625 88046 They're insured. Why should they give a fuck?<br />I don't even need a gun in a federal bank.
88130 91425 Heard about this one bloke, he walks<br />into a bank with a portable phone.
91508 94553 He gives the phone to a teller.<br />The bloke on the other end says...
94636 98265 “We got this guy's little girl. If you don't give<br />him all your money, we're gonna kill her.”
98348 100142 - Did it work?<br />- Fuckin' right it worked.
100225 103895 That's what I'm talkin' about. Knucklehead<br />walks into a bank with a telephone...
103979 107065 not a pistol, not a shotgun,<br />a fuckin' phone.
107149 109526 Cleans the place out.<br />They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
109610 111737 Did they hurt the little girl?
111820 115532 There probably never was a little girl.<br />The point of the story isn't a little girl.
115616 118577 The point of the story is they<br />robbed a bank with a telephone.
118660 121622 - You want to rob banks?<br />- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.
121705 124124 I'm illustrating if we did,<br />it'd be easier than what we've been doing.
124207 125542 No more liquor stores?
125626 128378 What've we been talkin' about?<br />Yeah, no more liquor stores.
128462 131423 Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.<br />There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.
131506 133759 Vietnamese, Koreans,<br />don't even speak fuckin' English.
133842 136178 You tell 'em empty out the register,<br />they don't know what you're talkin' about.
136261 137763 They make it too personal.
137846 139765 We keep on, one of these gook<br />fuckers gonna make us kill him.
139848 143477 - I'm not gonna kill anybody.<br />- I don't want to kill anybody either.
143560 146521 But they'll probably put us in<br />a situation where it's us or them.
146605 148148 And if it's not the gooks...
148231 151234 it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned<br />the store for 15 fucking generations.
151318 155739 You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the<br />counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.
155822 157741 Try walkin' into one of those places<br />with nothing but a phone.
157824 159743 See how far that gets you. Forget it.
159826 162746 - We're out of it.<br />- Well, what then, day jobs?
162829 164873 - Not in this life.<br />- What then?
167042 169211 <i>Garcon,</i> coffee!
169294 170962 This place.
173048 174925 <i>Garcon</i> means boy.
179388 182057 This place? <i>A</i> coffee shop?
182140 183725 What's wrong with that?
185185 188855 Nobody ever robs restaurants. Why not?
189815 192234 Bars, liquor stores...
192317 196029 gas stations; you get your head blown off<br />stickin' up one of them.
196113 199533 Restaurants, on the other hand,<br />you catch with their pants down.
199616 202994 They're not expectin' to get robbed.<br />Not as expectin' anyway.
203078 207040 I bet you could cut down<br />on the hero factor in a place like this.
207124 208125 Correct.
208208 211461 Same as banks, these places are insured.
211545 213880 Manager. He don't give a fuck.
213964 216800 They're just trying to get you out<br />before you start pluggin' the diners.
216883 220846 Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way<br />they're takin' a bullet for the register.
220929 223849 Busboys. Some wetback gettin'<br />paid $1.50 an hour...
223932 226435 really give a fuck you're<br />stealin' from the owner?
226518 229604 Customers sittin' there with food in their<br />mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.
229688 231314 One minute,<br />they're havin' a Denver omelet...
231398 234359 the next, someone<br />is stickin' a gun in their face.
234443 239489 See, I got the idea the last liquor store<br />we stuck up, remember?
239573 242242 - All the customers kept comin' in.<br />- Yeah.
242325 246163 You got the idea of takin' their wallets.<br />Now, that was a good idea.
246246 247456 Thank you.
247539 249624 Made more from the wallets<br />than we did from the register.
249708 252002 - Yes, we did.<br />- A lot of people come to restaurants.
252085 253670 A lot of wallets.
253754 255756 Pretty smart, huh?
256590 257841 Pretty smart.
260051 262387 I'm ready. Let's do it.<br />Right now, right here.
262471 266975 - Come on.<br />- All right. Same as last time, remember?
267058 269811 You're crowd control.<br />I'll handle the employees.
275484 278236 - I love you, pumpkin.<br />- I love you, honey bunny.
279446 281907 Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!
281990 284868 Any of you fucking pricks move...
284951 288747 and I'll execute every motherfuckin'<br />last one of you.
400358 402569 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Get down with the boogie</i>
402652 404821 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Get it on</i>
404905 407073 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Get down with the boogie</i>
407157 409367 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Get it on</i>
409451 411703 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Get up with the boogie</i>
411786 413872 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Get up with the get down</i>
413955 416207 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Get down and boogie</i>
416291 418793 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Shake it around</i>
426259 430347 - Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars.<br />- Okay, what you want to know?
430430 433224 - Hash is legal there, right?<br />- Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.
433308 437938 You just can't walk into a restaurant,<br />roll a joint and start puffin' away.
438021 441358 I mean, they want you to smoke in<br />your home or certain designated places.
441441 444069 - Those are hash bars?<br />- Yeah. It breaks down like this.
444152 446488 It's legal to buy it.<br />It's legal to own it.
446571 449741 And if you're the proprietor<br />of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
449824 454245 It's illegal to carry it, but that<br />doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.
454329 458750 If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,<br />it's illegal for them to search you.
458833 461169 I mean, that's a right the cops<br />in Amsterdam don't have.
461252 464881 Oh, man! I'm goin'.<br />That's all there is to it. I'm fuckin' goin'.
464965 467050 I know, baby. You'd dig it the most.
468468 470470 But you know what the funniest thing<br />about Europe is?
470553 472847 - What?<br />- It's the little differences.
472931 475183 I mean, they got the same shit<br />over there that they got here...
475266 478269 - but it's just there, it's a little different.<br />- Example.
478353 482023 You can walk into a movie theater<br />in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
482107 485735 And I don't mean just like no paper cup.<br />I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.
485819 488697 And in Paris, you can buy a beer<br />in McDonald's.
488780 493201 You know what they call<br />a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
493284 495453 They don't call it<br />a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?
495537 498331 They got the metric system. They wouldn't<br />know what the fuck a quarter-pounder is.
498415 502293 - What do they call it?<br />- They call it a Royale with Cheese.
502377 504295 - Royale with Cheese.<br />- That's right.
504379 505839 What do they call a Big Mac?
505922 509217 Big Mac's a Big Mac,<br />but they call it Le Big Mac.
509300 510885 Le Big Mac.
512512 514014 What do they call a Whopper?
514097 516516 I don't know. I didn't go<br />into Burger King.
516599 519227 You know what they put on french fries<br />in Holland instead of ketchup?
519310 520311 What?
520395 523231 - Mayonnaise.<br />- Goddamn!
523314 525942 I seen 'em do it, man.<br />They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.
526026 527610 Yuck.
530280 533199 We should have shotguns<br />for this kind of deal.
536578 539330 - How many up there?<br />- Three or four.
539414 543001 - That's countin' our guy?<br />- Not sure.
543084 545670 So that means that it could be<br />up to five guys up there?
545754 548923 - It's possible.<br />- We should have fuckin' shotguns.
550008 551634 - What's her name?<br />- Mia.
551718 555889 - Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?<br />- I don't know.
555972 559559 However people meet people.<br />She used to be a actress.
559642 562145 Oh, really?<br />She do anything I'd have seen?
562228 564898 I think her biggest deal<br />was she starred in a pilot.
564981 566649 Pilot? What's a pilot?
566733 570236 - Well, you know the shows on TV?<br />- I don't watch TV.
570320 573698 Yeah, but you are aware that there<br />is an invention called television...
573782 576034 and on this invention<br />they show shows, right?
576117 577118 Yeah.
577202 581581 The way they pick TV shows is they make<br />one show. That show's called a pilot.
581664 584292 Then they show that one show<br />to the people who pick shows...
584375 587587 and on the strength of that one show, they<br />decide if they wanna make more shows.
587670 592300 Some get chosen and become television<br />programs. Some don't, become nothin'.
592967 595470 She starred in one of the ones<br />that became nothing.
596471 598306 You remember Antwan Rockamora?
598389 602227 Half-black, half-Samoan.<br />Used to call him “Tony Rocky Horror.”
602310 603770 Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?
603853 605688 I wouldn't go so far as to<br />call the brother fat.
605772 608566 He got a weight problem. I mean, what's<br />a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.
608650 610693 I think I know who you mean.<br />What about him?
610777 613071 Marsellus fucked him up good.
613154 617408 Word 'round the campfire is it was on<br />account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
625542 629587 - So what he'd do? Fuck her?<br />- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.
629671 633174 - Well, then what then?<br />- He gave her a foot massage.
635593 638721 A foot massage?<br />That's it?
640056 641975 Then what'd Marsellus do?
642058 645228 Sent a couple cats over to his place.<br />They took him out on his patio.
645311 649232 Threw his ass over the balcony.<br />Nigger fell four stories.
649315 653361 He had a little garden down at the bottom<br />enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.
653444 655697 Nigger fell through that.
655780 658700 Since then, he kind of developed<br />a speech impediment.
660034 661786 That's a damn shame.
667625 670670 But still, you play with matches,<br />you get burned.
670753 672255 What do you mean?
672338 675633 You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's<br />new bride a foot massage.
675717 678178 You don't think he overreacted?
678261 683141 Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the<br />way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.
683224 687353 It was a foot massage. A foot massage is<br />nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.
687437 690982 It's laying your hands in a familiar way<br />on Marsellus's new wife.
691065 695945 I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out?<br />No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.
696029 697530 Stop right there.
697614 700783 Eatin' the bitch out and givin' the bitch a foot<br />massage ain't even the same fucking thing.
700867 704787 - It's not. It's the same ballpark.<br />- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.
704871 707790 Now, look, maybe your method<br />of massage differs from mine.
707874 711628 But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking<br />your tongue in the holiest of holies...
711711 715965 ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the<br />same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.
716049 719928 - Foot massages don't mean shit!<br />- Have you ever given a foot massage?
721095 724515 Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.<br />I'm the foot fuckin' master.
724599 726100 You given a lot of them?
726184 730104 Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and<br />everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.
730188 732565 Would you give a guy a foot massage?
734400 735860 Fuck you.
737028 740114 - You give 'em a lot?<br />- Fuck you.
740198 742909 You know, I'm kind of tired.<br />I could use a foot massage.
742992 745870 Yo, yo, yo, man. You best back off.<br />I'm gettin' a little pissed here.
747789 749874 - This is the door.<br />- Yeah, it is.
753127 754671 What time you got?
755838 757966 7:22 in the am.
758049 761636 No, it ain't quite time yet.<br />Come on. Let's hang back.
769644 772939 Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no<br />man a foot massage don't make it right...
773022 776234 for Marsellus to throw Antwan off<br />a building into a glass motherfuckin' house...
776317 779028 fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;<br />that shit ain't right.
779112 783324 Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better<br />paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.
783408 788371 I ain't ea yin' it's right, but you ea yin' a foot<br />massage don't mean nothin'. I'm ea yin' it does.
788454 793084 Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million<br />foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.
793167 796879 We act like they don't, but they do.<br />That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.
796963 799048 There's a sensuous thing goin' on...
799132 802343 where you don't talk about it,<br />but you know it and she knows it.
802427 807473 Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan<br />should've fuckin' better known better.
807557 811936 That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a man<br />with a sense of humor about this shit.
812020 813646 You know what I'm ea yin'?
814897 816816 It's an interestin' point.
816899 818860 Come on. Let's get into character.
825783 827785 - What's her name again?<br />- Mia.
827869 830872 - Mia.<br />- Why you so interested in big man's wife?
830955 836169 He's goin' out of town, Florida. And he asked<br />me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.
836252 840214 - Take care of her?<br />- No, man. Just take her out.
840298 843634 Show her a good time.<br />Make sure she don't get lonely.
843718 846262 You're gonna be takin'<br />Mia Wallace out on a date?
846346 848973 It is not a date.
849057 853144 It's just like if you were gonna take<br />your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.
853227 855438 It's just good company, that's all.
860735 864447 It's not a date.<br />It's definitely not a date.
871913 875750 Hey, kids. How you boys doin'?
875833 877502 Hey, keep chillin'.
884967 886469 You know who we are?
888054 891516 We're associates of your business partner,<br />Marsellus Wallace.
891599 894602 You do remember<br />your business partner, don't you?
896771 899065 Now, let me take a wild guess here.
902693 905321 - You're Brett, right?<br />- Yeah.
905405 907156 I thought so.
907240 910868 You remember your business partner<br />Marsellus Wallace, don't ya, Brett?
911911 913371 Yeah, I remember.
913454 917750 Good. Looks like me and Vincent<br />caught you boys at breakfast.
917834 920461 Sorry about that. Whatcha havin'?
921295 922505 Hamburgers.
922588 926676 Hamburgers! The cornerstone<br />of any nutritious breakfast.
927510 929095 What kind of hamburgers?
930430 932140 - Cheeseburgers.<br />- No, no, no.
932223 935309 Where'd you get 'em?<br />McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack in the Box?
935393 938187 - Where?<br />- Big Kahuna Burger.
938271 941399 Big Kahuna Burger!<br />That's that Hawaiian burger joint.
941482 945445 I hear they got some tasty burgers.<br />I ain't never had one myself. How are they?
946571 949657 - They're good.<br />- You mind if I try one of yours?
950950 953369 - This is yours here, right?<br />- Yeah.
963546 966674 This is a tasty burger! Vincent!
966757 969302 You ever had a Big Kahuna burger?
970303 973806 - Want a bite? They're real tasty.<br />- I ain't hungry.
973890 976309 Well, if you like burgers,<br />give 'em a try sometime.
976392 980229 Me, I can't usually get 'em<br />'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian...
980313 983441 which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.
983524 986068 But I do love the taste<br />of a good burger.
987904 990740 You know what they call<br />a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?
991866 993409 - No.<br />- Tell 'em, Vincent.
993493 997497 - A Royale with Cheese.<br />- A Royale with Cheese.
997580 999540 You know why they call it that?
1002251 1004212 Because of the metric system?
1005254 1008549 Check out the big brain on Brett!
1008633 1012011 You're a smart motherfucker.<br />That's right. The metric system.
1014305 1016432 - What's in this?<br />- Sprite.
1016516 1017850 Sprite. Good.
1017934 1022396 You mind if I have some of your tasty<br />beverage to wash this down with?
1023147 1024649 Go right ahead.
1036577 1038246 That hit the spot.
1039664 1042750 You. Flock of Seagulls.<br />You know why we're here?

1054720 1056514 You were ea yin'?

1090590 1093301 - We happy?<br />- Yeah, we happy.
1095344 1099640 Look, I'm sorry.<br />I didn't get your name.
1099724 1102893 I got yours. Vincent. Right?<br />But I never got yours.
1102977 1106689 My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't<br />talkin' your way outta this shit.
1106772 1108316 No, no, no.
1109817 1112236 I just want you to know how—
1115364 1118868 I just want you to know how sorry we are<br />that things got so fucked up...
1118951 1121120 with us and Mr. Wallace.
1121203 1125708 We got into this thing<br />with the best intentions. Really. I never—
1126334 1129170 Oh, I'm sorry, did I break<br />your concentration?
1129837 1131839 I didn't mean to do that. Please.
1131922 1137136 Continue. You were saying something<br />about “best intentions.”
1138512 1142391 What's the matter? Oh, you were finished!
1142475 1145186 Oh, well, allow me to retort.
1148731 1151734 What does Marsellus Wallace look like?
1152818 1154028 What?
1154945 1157323 - What country you from?<br />- What?
1157406 1160201 “What” ain't no country I ever heard of.<br />They speak English in What?
1160284 1161661 What?
1161744 1164455 - English, Motherfucker! Do you speak it?<br />- Yes!
1164538 1166207 - Then you know what I'm ea yin'!<br />- Yes.
1166290 1169710 Describe what<br />Marsellus Wallace looks like!
1170920 1172421 - What? I—<br />- Say “what” again!
1172505 1176425 Say “what” again! I dare ya!<br />I double dare you, motherfucker!
1176509 1180388 - Say “what” one more goddamn time!<br />- He's black.
1180471 1182807 - Go on!<br />- He's bald!
1182890 1185601 - Does he look like a bitch?<br />- What?
1187353 1191357 Does he look... like a bitch?
1191440 1192441 No!
1192525 1194652 Then why you tr yin'<br />to fuck him like a bitch, Brett?
1194735 1198364 - I didn't.<br />- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!
1198447 1200616 - You tried to fuck him.<br />- No, no.
1200700 1205955 But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be<br />fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
1206038 1209083 - You read the Bible, Brett?<br />- Yes!
1209166 1213713 Well, there's this passage I got memorized.<br />Sort of fits this occasion.
1213796 1216132 Ezekiel 25:17.
1217091 1219510 “The path of the righteous man...
1219593 1223514 is beset on all sides<br />by the inequities of the selfish...
1223597 1226517 and the tyranny of evil men.
1226600 1231522 Blessed is he who,<br />in the name of charity and goodwill...
1231605 1234734 shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness...
1234817 1237486 for he is truly his brother's keeper...
1237570 1241115 and the finder of lost children.
1241198 1247037 And I will strike down upon thee<br />with great vengeance and furious anger...
1247121 1251751 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy my brothers!
1251834 1255671 And you will know my name is the Lord...
1255755 1259133 when I lay my vengeance upon thee!”
1277359 1282072 I think you gonna find,<br />when all this shit is over and done—
1284450 1287953 I think you're gonna find yourself<br />one smilin' motherfucker.
1290372 1291874 The thing is, Butch...
1293250 1296295 right now... you got ability.
1297963 1303344 But painful as it may be,<br />ability... don't last.
1305596 1307932 And your days are just about over.
1309767 1312853 Now, that's a hard<br />motherfuckin' fact of life.
1314230 1317983 But that's a fact of life your ass is<br />gonna have to get realistic about.
1321195 1325366 You see, this business is filled to the brim<br />with unrealistic motherfuckers.
1326700 1330704 Motherfuckers who thought<br />their ass would age like wine.
1332373 1336126 If you mean it turns<br />to vinegar... it does.
1337378 1341173 If you mean it gets better<br />with age... it don't.
1343300 1344802 Besides, Butch...
1347012 1349640 how many fights you think<br />you got in you anyway?
1352977 1354270 Two?
1356063 1358774 Boxers don't have an old-timers' day.
1360568 1363571 You came close, but you never made it.
1364613 1368325 And if you were gonna make it,<br />you would have made it before now.
1385551 1387303 You my nigger?
1392474 1394518 Certainly appears so.
1401317 1405195 The night of the fight,<br />you may feel a slight sting.
1408407 1411285 That's pride fuckin' with you.
1412828 1414955 Fuck pride!
1417166 1418959 Pride only hurts.
1420294 1422212 It never helps.
1423631 1425674 You fight through that shit.
1427176 1432056 'Cause a year from now,<br />when you kickin' it in the Caribbean...
1432139 1436644 you gonna say to yourself,<br />“Marsellus Wallace was right.”
1438938 1441148 I got no problem with that, Mr. Wallace.
1443484 1447279 In the fifth, your ass goes down.
1451325 1452701 Say it.
1455537 1457790 In the fifth, my ass goes down.
1460918 1463420 Yo, Vincent Vega. Our man in Amsterdam.
1463504 1467967 Jules Winfield, our man in Inglewood.<br />Get your asses on in here.
1468050 1470302 Goddamn, nigger,<br />what's up with them clothes?
1470386 1471887 You don't even want to know.
1473430 1475224 Where's the big man?
1475307 1478060 The big man's right over<br />there takin' care of some business.
1478143 1482773 Why don't you hang back a second or two.<br />You see the white boy leave, just go on over.
1485693 1487736 How ya been?
1487820 1489905 I been doin' pretty good.<br />How 'bout yourself?
1489989 1491740 All right.
1494034 1496203 So I hear you're takin' Mia out tomorrow.
1499373 1501083 At Marsellus's request.
1503460 1505379 - Have you met Mia?<br />- Not yet.
1506964 1508632 What's so fuckin' funny?
1508716 1511301 - Not a goddamn thing.<br />- I got to piss.
1511385 1515639 Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot, all right?<br />It's the big man's wife.
1515723 1518392 I'm gonna sit across from her,<br />chew my food with my mouth closed...
1518475 1520436 laugh at her fuckin' jokes, and that's it.
1520519 1523647 Hey, my name's Paul,<br />and this shit's between y'all.
1523731 1527526 Then what'd you fuckin'<br />ask me about it for? Asshole.
1535576 1537786 - Gimme a pack of Red Apples.<br />- Filters?
1537870 1539288 No.
1542624 1546045 - You lookin' at somethin', friend?<br />- You ain't my friend, palooka.
1548630 1552134 - What was that?<br />- I think you heard me just fine, punchy.
1552217 1554803 Vincent Vega's in the house?
1554887 1557848 My nigger, get your ass over here.
1565773 1568525 - What's up?<br />- Man, I'm really sorry.
1568609 1570778 You shouldn't worry about it.
1570861 1573822 Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.
1576325 1577868 And some matches.
1581789 1583207 Thanks.
1585584 1589880 It's as if it turns every part of<br />your body into the tip of a penis.
1589963 1593258 I'll lend it to you.<br />It's a great book on piercing.
1593342 1598347 That gun to pierce your ears, they don't<br />use that to pierce your nipples, do they?
1598430 1602267 Forget that gun. That guns goes against<br />the entire idea behind piercing.
1602351 1607231 All my piercing, 18 places on my body,<br />every one of 'em done with a needle.
1607314 1610776 Five in each ear, one through the nipple<br />of my left breast...
1610859 1613987 two in my right nostril,<br />one in my left eyebrow...
1614071 1616907 one in my belly, one in my lip,<br />one in my clit...
1616990 1620452 - and I wear a stud in my tongue.<br />- Excuse me.
1620536 1622454 I was just curious...
1622538 1626416 but... why would you wear<br />a stud in your tongue?
1626500 1629962 Sex thing. Helps fellatio.
1630045 1633549 Vincenzo. Step in my office.
1640806 1643851 This is Panda from Mexico.<br />Very good stuff.
1643934 1647354 Now, that's Bava.<br />Different, but equally good.
1647437 1650357 And that is Choco<br />from the Harz Mountains of Germany.
1650440 1654862 Now, the first two are the same.<br />300 a gram. Those are friend prices.
1654945 1657906 But this one is a little more expensive.
1657990 1660367 This is 500 a gram.
1660450 1663829 But, when you shoot it,<br />you will know where that extra money went.
1663912 1668000 There's nothing wrong with these two.<br />This is real, real, real good shit.
1668083 1670669 But this one is a fuckin' madman.
1671837 1674590 Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.
1674673 1677676 Am I a nigger? Are we in Inglewood? No.
1677759 1680929 You're in my home. Now, white people<br />who know the difference...
1681013 1683974 between good shit and bad shit,<br />this is the house they come to.
1684057 1687436 Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi<br />Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...
1687519 1690814 - any old day of the fuckin' week.<br />- That's a bold statement.
1690898 1694735 This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.<br />This is a seller's market.
1694818 1698822 Coke is fuckin' dead as... dead.
1698906 1701742 Heroin, it's comin' back<br />in a big fuckin' way.
1704036 1707497 - All right. Gimme three grams of madman.<br />- Okay.
1707581 1711001 Now, if it's as good as you say it is,<br />I'll come back and buy another thousand.
1711084 1713837 I just hope that I still<br />have some left for ya...
1713921 1718091 but I'm givin' you<br />some out of my own private stash.
1718175 1720093 That is what a nice guy I am.
1721428 1725515 - I'm outta balloons. Is a baggie all right?<br />- Yeah, that's cool.
1725599 1727559 All right. I'll just get one for ya.
1727643 1732564 Honey, will you get me some baggies<br />and twistix from the kitchen?
1732648 1734233 Okay.
1734316 1737694 Hey, what do you think about Trudi?<br />She ain't got a boyfriend.
1737778 1741573 - You wanna hang out and get high?<br />- Which one's Trudi?
1741657 1745827 - The one with all the shit in her face?<br />- No, that's Jody.
1745911 1747788 That's my wife.
1750123 1753001 - I'm sorry, man.<br />- Thank you.
1753085 1756672 - No, I can't. I gotta be some place.<br />- All right, no <i>problemo.</i>
1756755 1758507 I'll take a rain check.
1761385 1763136 Thank you, Jody.
1763762 1765389 Still got your Malibu?
1766598 1769685 Oh, man, you know what some fucker<br />did the other day?
1769768 1771687 - What?<br />- Fuckin' keyed it.
1771770 1775357 - Oh, man, that's fucked up.<br />- Tell me about it.
1775440 1778110 I had it in storage for three years.
1778193 1782531 It was out five days, and some dickless<br />piece of shit fucked with it.
1782614 1787035 They should be fuckin' killed, man.<br />No trial, no jury, straight to execution.
1787119 1791832 I wish I could've caught him doin' it. I'd<br />have given anything to catch that asshole.
1791915 1794918 It'd been worth him doin' it<br />just so I could've caught him.
1795002 1796628 What a fucker!
1796712 1799506 What's more chicken-shit than<br />fuckin' with a man's automobile?
1799589 1802467 - Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.<br />- You don't do it.
1802551 1804928 - It's just against the rules.<br />- Thank you.
1805012 1806513 Thank you.
1807264 1810058 - Mind if I shoot up here?<br />- Hey, mi <i>casa es su casa.</i>
1916373 1920460 <i>Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed.<br />The door's open.</i>

2215505 2219843 Let's see, steak, steak, steak. Oh, yeah,<br />I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.
2219926 2221428 I'll have that.
2221511 2224180 How do you want that cooked?<br />Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell?
2224264 2227434 Bloody as hell, and—<br />Oh, yeah, look at this— vanilla coke.
2229436 2230937 What about you, Peggy Sue?
2231980 2237819 I'll have the...<br />Durward Kirby burger, bloody.
2238778 2242699 And... a five-dollar shake.
2242782 2245493 How do you want that shake,<br />Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?
2245577 2249748 - Martin and Lewis.<br />- Did you just order a five-dollar shake?
2251916 2256004 - That's a shake? That's milk and ice cream?<br />- Last I heard.
2256087 2259549 That's five dollars? You don't<br />put bourbon in it or nothin'?
2259632 2261968 - No.<br />- Just checking.
2262051 2263720 I'll be right back with your drinks.
2263803 2266014 <i>To lonesome town</i>
2266097 2270810 <i>To cry my troubles away</i>
2272395 2276483 Could you...<br />roll me one of those, cowboy?
2277525 2279402 You can have this one, cowgirl.
2279486 2280528 Thanks.
2280612 2283865 <i>The streets are filled with regret</i>
2286159 2287619 Think nothin' of it.
2287702 2292081 <i>Lay me down<br />in lonesome town</i>
2292165 2295668 - <i>I can learn to forget</i><br />- So...
2295752 2298838 Marsellus said you just<br />got back from Amsterdam.
2298922 2302050 - Sure did.<br />- How long were you there?
2302842 2304677 Just over three years.
2307180 2310016 I go there about once a year<br />to chill out for a month.
2310642 2313311 No kiddin'? I didn't know that.
2314938 2316856 Why would you?
2321361 2323029 I heard you did a pilot.
2324697 2326783 That was my 15 minutes.
2326866 2328409 What was it?
2328493 2333164 It was a show about a team of female<br />secret agents called Fox Force <i>Five.</i>
2333248 2335959 - What?<br />- <i>Fox Force Five.</i>
2336042 2338294 Fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks.
2338378 2340839 Force, as in we're a force<br />to be reckoned with.
2340922 2343675 And five, as in there's<br />one-two-three-four-five of us.
2343758 2347470 There was a blond one,<br />Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.
2347554 2350640 The Japanese fox was a kung fu master.
2350723 2354811 The black girl was a demolition expert.
2354894 2357730 French Fox's specialty was sex.
2357814 2359399 What was your specialty?
2360066 2361568 Knives.
2362193 2364279 The character I played, Raven McCoy...
2364362 2368199 her background was she grew up raised<br />by circus performers.
2368283 2372537 According to the show, she was the<br />deadliest woman in the world with a knife.
2372620 2375373 And she knew a zillion old jokes.
2375456 2379586 Her grandfather,<br />an old vaudevillian, taught her.
2379669 2382964 And if we would have got picked up,<br />they would've worked in a gimmick...
2383047 2386926 where every show<br />I would've told another joke.
2389095 2390889 You know any of them old jokes?
2390972 2394684 Well, I only got the chance to say one<br />'cause we only did one show.
2394767 2397312 - Tell me.<br />- It's corny.
2398229 2400315 Don't be that way. Tell me.
2400398 2402942 No, you wouldn't like it,<br />and I'd be embarrassed.
2403026 2408072 You'd be embarr— You told 50 million<br />people, and you can't tell me?
2408156 2412035 - I promise I won't laugh.<br />- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.
2412118 2414412 That's not what I meant. You know it.
2414495 2417916 Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you<br />'cause it's been built up too much.
2417999 2419709 What a gyp.
2422295 2424130 Martin and Lewis.
2427216 2428593 Vanilla coke.
2436017 2437268 Yummy.
2437352 2439312 You think I could have a sip of that?
2442357 2444025 Be my guest.
2444108 2446736 I gotta know what<br />a five-dollar shake tastes like.
2448196 2450239 You can use my straw.<br />I don't have cooties.
2450323 2453117 - Yeah, but maybe I do.<br />- Cooties I can handle.
2454661 2456162 All right.
2463711 2466506 Goddamn, that's a pretty<br />fuckin' good milk shake!
2466589 2467590 Told ya.
2467674 2470677 I don't know if it was worth five dollars,<br />but it's pretty fuckin' good.
2505586 2507380 Don't you hate that?
2507463 2509132 Hate what?
2509215 2511551 Uncomfortable silences.
2512927 2518057 Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about<br />bullshit in order to be comfortable?
2518891 2521352 I don't know. That's a good question.
2523146 2525898 That's when you know<br />you found somebody really special.
2526941 2531654 When you can just shut the fuck up<br />for a minute and comfortably share silence.
2531738 2535408 Well, I don't think we're quite there yet,<br />but don't feel bad. We just met each other.
2537326 2538953 I'll tell you what.
2540538 2543791 I'm gonna go to the bathroom<br />and powder my nose.
2543875 2547086 You sit here...<br />and think of something to say.
2548087 2549714 I'll do that.
2553217 2554552 Okay.
2579786 2581954 I said goddamn!
2582038 2585208 Goddamn! Goddamn.
2587418 2589420 I need some hair spray.
2598304 2600556 Don't you just love it when you<br />come back from the bathroom...
2600640 2602642 to find your food waiting for you?
2602725 2604936 We're lucky we got anything at all.
2605019 2607396 I don't think Buddy Holly's<br />much of a waiter.
2608397 2610525 Maybe we should've sat<br />in Marilyn Monroe's section.
2610608 2613653 - Which one? There's two Monroes.<br />- No, there's not.
2614403 2615696 That is Marilyn Monroe.
2618032 2619867 That is Mamie Van Doren.
2620952 2624872 I don't see Jayne Mansfield,<br />so she must have the night off.
2624956 2628376 - Pretty smart.<br />- Yeah. I got my moments.
2628459 2630253 So did you think of somethin' to say?
2630336 2632338 Actually, I did.
2634465 2635925 However...
2638970 2641139 you seem like a really nice person, and I—
2641222 2642723 I don't want to offend you.
2644142 2649313 This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless,<br />boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.
2649397 2651816 This sounds like you<br />actually have somethin' to say.
2651899 2654360 Well, well, I do. I do.
2655862 2659448 - But you have to promise not to be offended.<br />- No, no.
2659532 2663619 You can't promise somethin' like that.<br />I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.
2663703 2665580 You can ask me what you're gonna ask me...
2665663 2668124 and my natural response could be<br />to get offended.
2668207 2671127 Then through no fault of my own,<br />I would have broken my promise.
2671210 2673880 - Let's just forget it.<br />- That's an impossibility.
2673963 2678009 Trying to forget anything as intriguing<br />as this would be an exercise in futility.
2678092 2680303 - Is that a fact?<br />- And besides...
2680386 2683806 isn't it more exciting<br />when you don't have permission?
2683890 2685391 All right, all right.
2685474 2687393 Well, here goes.
2688352 2691355 What did you think about<br />what happened to Antwan?
2691439 2694859 - Who's Antwan?<br />- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.
2694942 2696444 He fell out of a window.
2698237 2700114 Well, that is one way to say it.
2700198 2702950 Another way to say it would be<br />that he was thrown out.
2703034 2706162 Another way would be<br />he was thrown out by Marsellus.
2706245 2707830 Yet, even another way...
2707914 2711375 is to say he was thrown out of<br />a window by Marsellus because of you.
2711459 2713878 - Is that a fact?<br />- No.
2713961 2717089 No, it's not a fact. It's just what I heard.<br />That's just what I heard.
2717715 2719675 - Who told you?<br />- They.
2721093 2722595 “They” talk a lot, don't they?
2724764 2727433 They certainly do. They certainly do.
2727516 2729518 Don't be shy, Vincent.<br />What else did “they” say?
2729602 2731270 I'm not shy.
2732605 2734523 Did it involve the “F” word?
2734607 2738611 No, no, no, no, no. They just said that<br />Antwan had given you a foot massage.
2740112 2743366 - And?<br />- And nothin'. That's it.
2745785 2750039 You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror<br />out of a fourth-story window...
2750122 2752708 for giving me a foot massage?
2752792 2754293 And you believe that?
2755795 2758881 Well, at the time I was told<br />it sounded reasonable.
2758965 2762051 Marsellus throwing Tony out<br />of a fourth-story window...
2762134 2764512 for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?
2764595 2767932 No, it seemed excessive,<br />but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.
2768015 2771477 I understand that Marsellus<br />is very protective of you.
2772270 2776148 A husband being protective<br />of his wife is one thing.
2776232 2779986 A husband almost killing another man for<br />touching his wife's feet is something else.
2780569 2782071 But did it happen?
2782154 2787576 Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was<br />my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.
2788619 2789996 Really?
2790079 2793582 Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw<br />Tony out that window...
2793666 2795543 except Marsellus and Tony.
2796502 2799839 When you little scamps get together,<br />you're worse than a sewing circle.
2799922 2804468 Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment<br />you've all been waiting for.
2804552 2809181 The world-famous<br />Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.
2813019 2816314 Now, this is where one lucky couple...
2816397 2820860 will win this handsome trophy<br />that Marilyn here is holding.
2820943 2824488 Now, who will be our first contestants?
2824572 2826866 - Right here!<br />- All right!
2826949 2829952 - I wanna dance.<br />- No, no, no, no, no.
2830036 2834749 No, no, no, no, no. I do believe<br />Marsellus, my husband, your boss...
2834832 2837752 told you to take me out<br />and do whatever I wanted.
2837835 2842006 Now I wanna dance;<br />I wanna win; I want that trophy.
2842089 2844675 - So dance good.<br />- All right. You asked for it.
2844759 2846594 Let's hear it for our first contestants.
2852350 2854810 Now let's meet our first contestants<br />here this evening.
2854894 2857480 Young lady, what is your name?
2857563 2859648 Mrs. Mia Wallace.
2859732 2862360 And how 'bout your fella here?
2862443 2864153 Vincent Vega.
2864236 2867782 All right, let's see what<br />you can do. Take it away!
2867865 2870117 - Go for it.<br />- Come on!
2889095 2893057 <i>It was a teenage wedding<br />and the old folks wished them well</i>
2895059 2899021 <i>You could see that Pierre<br />did truly love the mademoiselle</i>
2901107 2905194 <i>And now the young monsieur and madame<br />have rung the chapel bell</i>
2907154 2911450 <i>C'est la vie say the old folks<br />It goes to show you never can tell</i>
2913327 2917498 <i>They furnished off an apartment<br />with a two-room Roebucks sale</i>
2919417 2923671 <i>The 'coolerador was crammed<br />with TV dinners and ginger ale</i>
2925548 2929468 <i>But when Pierre found work<br />the little money comin' worked out well</i>
2931554 2935808 <i>C'est la vie say the old folks<br />It goes to show you never can tell</i>
2937518 2941897 <i>They had a hi-fi phono<br />and boy did they let it blast</i>
2943941 2948195 <i>Seven hundred little records<br />all rock, rhythm and jazz</i>
2949947 2954034 <i>But when the sun went down<br />the rapid tempo of the music fell</i>
2955995 2961000 <i>C'est la vie say the old folks<br />It goes to show you never can tell</i>
2986525 2990738 <i>They had a teenage wedding<br />and the old folks wished them well</i>
2992781 2996744 <i>You could see that Pierre<br />did truly love the mademoiselle</i>
3031946 3035157 Is that what you call<br />an uncomfortable silence?
3035241 3037535 I don't know what you call that.
3039662 3041288 Drinks! Music!
3042289 3043832 I'm gonna take a piss.
3044917 3049588 That's a little bit more information than<br />I needed, Vince, but go right ahead.
3062643 3064520 <i>Girl</i>
3064603 3066272 <i>Bomp, bomp, bom</i>
3066355 3070067 <i>You'll be a woman soon</i>
3073237 3075698 <i>I love you so much<br />Can't count all the ways</i>
3075781 3078742 <i>I'd die for you, girl<br />and all they can say is</i>
3078826 3080828 <i>He's not your kind</i>
3082121 3087209 <i>You never get tired of putting me down<br />and I never know when I come around</i>
3087293 3089753 <i>What I'm gonna find</i>
3089837 3092840 <i>Don't let them<br />make up your mind</i>
3094008 3096385 <i>Don't you know, girl</i>
3098262 3101890 <i>You'll be a woman soon</i>
3101974 3104893 One drink, and that's it.
3104977 3108981 Don't be rude.<br />Drink your drink, but do it quickly.
3110524 3112985 Say good night... and go home.
3115404 3119533 <i>You'll be a woman soon</i>
3120743 3122828 <i>Soon</i>
3124038 3127333 <i>You'll need a man</i>
3129084 3130919 <i>I've been misunderstood<br />for all of my life</i>
3131003 3134214 <i>But what they're n', girl<br />it cuts like a knife</i>
3134298 3135799 <i>The boy's no good</i>
3136717 3139428 <i>Well, I've finally have found<br />what I been lookin' for</i>
3139511 3142306 <i>But if they get a chance<br />they'll end it for sure</i>
3142389 3143891 <i>Sure they would</i>
3143974 3146685 <i>Baby, I've done all I could</i>
3148228 3151398 You see, this is a moral test of oneself.
3151482 3154735 Whether or not you can maintain loyalty.
3154818 3158113 Because... being loyal is very important.
3158197 3162785 <i>You never get tired of putting me down<br />and I never know when I come around</i>
3162868 3165454 <i>What I'm gonna find</i>

3210833 3213127 “Good night.<br />I've had a very lovely evening.”
3214420 3219550 Walk out the door, get in the car, go home,<br />jerk off and that's all you gonna do.
3224346 3227266 <i>Now it's up to you, girl</i>
3229017 3232980 <i>You'll be a woman soon</i>
3234148 3235566 <i>Please</i>

3269683 3272811 So listen, I gotta go, all right?
3275939 3279276 Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
3279359 3282070 You fu— Oh, Jesus Christ!
3282154 3284448 Oh, fuck me. Fuck me!
3284531 3288410 Oh— Come on, girl. We're gettin' outta<br />here. We gotta walk now.

3319775 3322152 <i>Please! Please!</i>
3322236 3324905 <i>Yes, yes. Hold hands, you lovebirds.</i>
3331161 3333372 Fuck you, Lance! Answer!
3338418 3340337 <i>Now what do you say?</i>
3340420 3342172 <i>I give up! I'll marry you!</i>
3345425 3348095 Lance! The goddamn phone's ringing!
3349805 3351473 I can hear it.
3351557 3354726 I thought you told those fuckin' assholes<br />never to call here this late!
3354810 3356311 Yeah, I told them.
3356395 3359648 And that is exactly what I'm going to tell<br />this fucking asshole right now.
3362150 3364945 - <i>Don't you dare strike me!</i><br />- Hello.
3365028 3367322 Lance! Vincent.
3367406 3370284 I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.<br />I'm coming to your house.
3371702 3374454 Hold your horses, man.<br />What's the problem?
3374538 3377791 - I got this chick, she's fuckin' Odin' on me!<br />- Well, don't bring her here!
3377875 3379835 I'm not even joking with you!
3379918 3382212 Do not be bringing some<br />fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!
3382296 3384339 - No choice.<br />- She's Odin'?
3384423 3387634 - She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!<br /><i>- just dandy.</i>
3387718 3391889 Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet,<br />take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.
3391972 3394391 - Negative!<br />- This is not my fuckin' problem, man!
3394474 3397185 You fucked her up,<br />you fuckin' deal with this!
3398270 3401106 Are you talkin' to me<br />on a cellular phone?
3401189 3403609 I don't know you. Who is this?<br />Don't come here!
3403692 3405861 I'm hanging up the phone!<br />Prank caller! Prank caller!
3416121 3418040 What the hell was that?
3420000 3423712 Have you lost your fucking mind? You were<br />talking about drug shit on a cellular phone!
3423795 3425422 Lance, help me.
3425505 3427925 - You crashed your car into my fucking house!<br />- Grab her feet.
3428008 3431929 Are you deaf? You are not bringing this<br />fucked-up bitch into my house!
3432012 3434431 This “fucked-up bitch” is<br />Marsellus Wallace's wife.
3434514 3436558 - Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?<br />- Yeah.
3436642 3439436 If she croaks on me,<br />I am a fucking grease spot!
3439519 3445108 I will be forced to tell him that you did<br />not help and let her die on your lawn.
3445192 3447653 Now, come on,<br />help me, help me. Pick her up.
3449196 3450656 Shit.
3453200 3454576 Lance!
3455661 3457079 Shit.
3457663 3460082 It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.
3460165 3462250 What the fuck's going on out here?
3463543 3465462 Who's she?
3465545 3468465 Go to the fridge and get the thing<br />with the adrenaline shot.
3468548 3470592 - What's wrong with her?<br />- She's ODing!
3470676 3472761 - Get her outta here!<br />- Get the shot!
3472844 3476348 - Fuck you! Fuck you too!<br />- What a fuckin' bitch.
3476431 3477975 Just keep talking to her, all right?
3478058 3480852 She's gettin' the shot. I'm going to go<br />get my little black medical book.
3480936 3482938 What the fuck you need a medical book for?
3483021 3485440 I've never had to give<br />an adrenaline shot before!
3485524 3488944 I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers!<br />My friends can handle their highs!
3489027 3491446 - Get the shot!<br />- I am, if you'll let me!
3491530 3493949 - I ain't stopping you!<br />- Stop talking to me. Start talking to her!
3494032 3495951 - Get the shot!<br />- All right!
3499621 3503125 - Hurry up. We're losing her!<br />- I'm looking as fast as I can!
3503208 3504668 What's he looking for?
3504751 3508046 - I don't know. Some book.<br />- What are you looking for?
3508130 3510549 - A little black medical book.<br />- What are you looking for?
3510632 3515220 My little black medical book!<br />It's like a textbook they give to nurses.
3515303 3518223 - I never saw no medical book.<br />- Trust me. I have one.
3518306 3520600 If it's so important, why don't<br />you keep it with the shot?
3520684 3522269 I don't know!<br />Stop bothering me!
3522352 3524980 While you're looking, that<br />girl's gonna die on our carpet.
3525063 3526732 You're never gonna find<br />anything in this mess!
3526815 3528984 I'm gonna fucking kill you<br />if you don't shut up!
3529067 3531194 Lance, get in here!
3531278 3533780 - Right?<br />- Get the fuck outta my way.
3533864 3535490 Pig.
3535574 3537743 Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot.
3537826 3540912 While I'm doing this,<br />you take off her shirt and find her heart.
3541913 3543999 - Does it gotta be exact?<br />- Yeah, it's gotta be exact.
3544082 3546293 We're giving her a shot in the heart,<br />so it's gotta be exact.
3546376 3548545 I don't know exactly where<br />her heart is. I think it's right here.
3548628 3550130 - That's it.<br />- This it?
3550213 3552799 All right, what I need is<br />a big, fat magic marker.
3552883 3554801 - You got it?<br />- What?
3554885 3557554 A magic marker. A felt pen!
3557637 3560265 A fuckin' black magic marker! Christ.
3560348 3565437 - Come on, man. Hurry up!<br />- Fuck! Okay, okay. Okay. I think it's ready.
3568607 3571068 - Hurry up, man.<br />- I'll tell you what to do.
3571151 3574071 - You're gonna give her the shot.<br />- No, you're gonna give her the shot.
3574154 3576073 I ain't giving her the shot.<br />I never done this before.
3576156 3578116 I never done this either!<br />I ain't starting now!
3578200 3580035 You brought her here.<br />You give her the shot.
3580118 3582621 The day I bring an ODing bitch<br />to your house, then I give her the shot.
3582704 3585624 - Give her the shot.<br />- Give it to me. Give me that.
3586708 3588627 All right, tell me what to do.
3588710 3592214 Okay, you're giving her an injection<br />of adrenaline straight to her heart.
3592297 3594674 But she's got a breastplate—<br />you gotta pierce through that.
3594758 3597719 You gotta bring the needle<br />down in a stabbing motion.
3597803 3601223 - I gotta stab her three times?<br />- No, just stab her once!
3601306 3604726 But it's gotta be hard enough to get<br />through her breastplate into her heart.
3604810 3607729 Once you do that,<br />you press down on the plunger.
3607813 3610273 - Okay. Then what happens?<br />- Kinda curious about that myself.
3610357 3613276 This ain't no fuckin' joke!<br />Am I gonna kill her?
3613360 3615237 She's supposed to come out<br />of it like that. It's—
3615320 3616780 All right, count to three.
3616863 3619032 - All right. Ready?<br />- One.
3624329 3625872 Two.
3634131 3635173 Three!
3650397 3653692 If you're all right, then say something.
3654609 3656278 Something.
3657445 3659114 That was fuckin' trippy.
3661366 3663702 - Ohh.<br />- Oh, man.
3689394 3691313 Mia. Mia.
3693481 3694900 What's—
3695984 3700405 What's your thoughts on— on—<br />on how to handle this?
3701364 3702908 What's yours?
3705952 3710248 Well, I'm of the opinion that<br />if Marsellus lived his whole life...
3710332 3712792 he doesn't need to know<br />nothing about this incident.
3714502 3718965 If Marsellus knew about this incident,<br />I'd be in as much trouble as you.
3719049 3720926 I seriously doubt that.
3721635 3724262 I can keep a secret if you can.
3726598 3728099 Shake on it?
3734272 3736024 Mum's the word?
3736107 3738068 Cool.
3738777 3741446 Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to<br />go home and have a heart attack.
3745116 3746117 Vincent.
3748995 3751998 Do you wanna hear my Fox <i>Force Five</i> joke?
3753083 3754292 Sure.
3755085 3758088 Except I think I'm still<br />a little too petrified to laugh.
3758171 3761091 No, you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny.
3761174 3763510 But if you still wanna hear it,<br />I'll tell it.
3764302 3766805 - I can't wait.<br />- Okay.
3766888 3769224 Three tomatoes are<br />walkin' down the street.
3769307 3771726 Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato<br />and Baby Tomato.
3771810 3776439 Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,<br />and Papa Tomato gets really angry.
3776523 3780568 Goes back and squishes him and says,<br />“Ketchup.”
3784489 3785907 Ketchup.
3790537 3792163 See you around.
3813727 3817439 <i>Oh, that paddlefoot. He funny, silly dog.</i>
3817522 3820525 <i>He think totem pole alive!</i>
3821359 3823320 <i>He Arctic tenderfoot!</i>
3825071 3827449 <i>That totem pole been here forever!</i>
3827532 3828992 Butch?
3829075 3831911 <i>One more thing, and we'll start for—</i>
3831995 3834914 - Butch, stop watching TV for a second.<br />- Yeah?
3834998 3838626 - You've got a special visitor.<br />- <i>Stand up. Stand up.</i>
3840795 3845091 Now, do you remember when I told you<br />your daddy died in a POW camp?
3846384 3850138 Well, this here is Captain Koons.
3850221 3852349 He was in the POW camp with Daddy.
3858938 3863568 Hello, little man.<br />Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.
3864652 3867072 See, I was a good friend of your dad's.
3867947 3872535 We were in that Hanoi pit of hell<br />together, over five years.
3873578 3874954 Hopefully...
3876289 3878249 you'll never have to<br />experience this yourself...
3878333 3882003 but when two men are in a situation<br />like me and your dad were...
3882087 3884881 for as long as we were...
3884964 3887884 you take on certain<br />responsibilities of the other.
3889344 3890970 If it'd been me who'd—
3892597 3898937 not made it, Major Coolidge'd<br />be talking right now to my son Jim.
3899813 3902607 But the way it turned out,<br />I'm talking to you.
3904025 3905443 Butch...
3907529 3909030 I got something for ya.
3915954 3918039 This watch I got here...
3918123 3922877 was first purchased by your<br />great-grandfather during the First World War.
3922961 3927382 It was bought in a little general store<br />in Knoxville, Tennessee.
3927465 3931261 Made by the first company<br />to ever make wristwatches.
3931344 3934097 Up 'til then, people just<br />carried pocket watches.
3934180 3937517 It was bought by<br />Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...
3937600 3940395 on the day he set sail for Paris.
3940478 3942772 This was your<br />great-grandfather's war watch...
3942856 3946443 and he wore it every day<br />he was in that war, and...
3946526 3950071 when he'd done his duty,<br />he went home to your great-grandmother...
3950155 3954576 took the watch off, put it in an old<br />coffee can, and in that can it stayed...
3954659 3958872 until your grandad, Dane Coolidge,<br />was called upon by his country...
3958955 3962876 to go overseas and fight<br />the Germans once again.
3962959 3965044 This time they called it World War II.
3966504 3970508 Your great-grandfather gave this watch<br />to your grandad for good luck.
3971551 3974554 Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't<br />as good as his old man's.
3974637 3977557 Dane was a Marine, and he was killed...
3977640 3980351 along with all the other Marines<br />at the battle of Wake Island.
3981227 3983688 Your grandad was facing death.
3984731 3986441 He knew it.
3986524 3990653 None of those boys had any illusions<br />about ever leaving that island alive...
3990737 3993948 so three days before<br />the Japanese took the island...
3994032 3999245 your grandad asked a gunner on<br />an Air Force transport, name of Winocki—
3999329 4002248 a man he'd never met before in his life—
4002332 4005293 to deliver to his infant son...
4005376 4009964 who he'd never seen in the flesh,<br />his gold watch.
4010048 4014385 Three days later, your grandad was dead,<br />but Winocki kept his word.
4014469 4018681 After the war was over,<br />he paid a visit to your grandmother...
4018765 4023019 delivering to your infant father<br />his dad's gold watch.
4023102 4025021 This watch.
4030902 4036324 This watch was on your daddy's wrist<br />when he was shot down over Hanoi.
4036407 4039827 He was captured, put in<br />a Vietnamese prison camp.
4039911 4043957 He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch...
4044040 4046834 it'd be confiscated, taken away.
4047627 4051339 The way your dad looked at it,<br />this watch was your birthright.
4051422 4055134 He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their<br />greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright...
4055218 4059347 so he hid it in one place<br />he knew he could hide something— his ass.
4059430 4062850 Five long years<br />he wore this watch up his ass.
4062934 4067105 Then he died of dysentery—<br />He give me the watch.
4067188 4071025 I hid this uncomfortable<br />hunk of metal up my ass two years.
4071109 4073027 <i>Then...</i>
4073111 4077198 after seven years,<br />I was sent home to my family and...
4077282 4078700 now...
4081619 4084581 little man, I give the watch to you.
4107437 4109355 It's time, Butch.
4117113 4120033 <i>In the lightweight division...</i>
4120116 4123244 <i>in the right corner<br />wearing the blue trunks...</i>
4123328 4126581 <i>weighing 210 pounds...</i>
4126664 4129834 <i>Floyd Ray Wilson!</i>
4132879 4135381 <i>It's official. It's official.<br />Wilson is dead!</i>
4135465 4137300 <i>Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest...</i>
4137383 4139802 <i>and hands down, the most brutal<br />fight this city's ever seen.</i>
4139886 4143222 <i>Coolidge was out of there faster than I've<br />ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.</i>
4143306 4145975 - <i>Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?</i><br />- <i>My guess would be yes.</i>
4146059 4150480 <i>I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way<br />to the realization of what he was doing.</i>
4150563 4152440 <i>I think any man would've<br />left the ring that fast.</i>
4152523 4155485 <i>Do you feel this tragedy<br />is gonna affect the world of boxing?</i>
4155568 4159489 <i>A tragedy like this can't help but shake<br />the world of boxing to its very foundations.</i>
4159572 4163451 <i>It's of paramount importance, during the sad<br />weeks ahead, the eyes of the WBA remain—</i>
4198861 4201155 Man, you know I didn't—
4201239 4204158 - Marsellus.<br />- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.
4204242 4206160 I didn't do it.
4206244 4208746 - How you doing?<br />- Great.
4208830 4210748 I never thanked you for dinner.
4213167 4215086 - What you got?<br />- He booked.
4215169 4218506 - His trainer?<br />- Says he don't know nothin'. I believe him.
4218589 4221759 - I think Butch surprised his ass same as us.<br />- No, we don't wanna think.
4221843 4225430 We wanna know. Take him to the kennel,<br />sic the dogs on his ass.
4225513 4228349 We'll find out for goddamn sure<br />what he knows and what he don't.
4228433 4230226 Butch's search— how do you want it done?
4230893 4233604 I'm prepared to scour the Earth<br />for that motherfucker.
4233688 4236941 If Butch goes to Indochina, I want<br />a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...
4237024 4241779 - ready to pop a cap in his ass.<br />- I will take care of it.
4251622 4252999 Mister.
4256919 4259380 - Hey, mister.<br />- What?
4259464 4264260 You were in that fight,<br />the fight on the radio.
4264343 4267805 - You're the fighter?<br />- Whatever gave you that idea?
4267889 4270600 No, come on.
4270683 4272643 You're him.
4272727 4275146 I know you're him.
4276898 4278775 Tell me you're him.
4278858 4280777 I'm him.
4281861 4283988 You killed the other boxing man.
4287950 4290036 He's dead?
4290119 4292538 The radio said he was dead.
4295333 4297543 Sorry about that, Floyd.
4298836 4301339 What does it feel like?
4301422 4303341 What does what feel like?
4303424 4304926 Killing a man.
4307136 4311182 Beating another man to death<br />with your bare hands.
4311766 4313351 What are you, a weirdo?
4313434 4318022 No. It is a subject<br />I have much interest in.
4320274 4323945 You are the first person<br />I have ever met who has killed somebody.
4326697 4328157 So?
4329200 4331994 What does it feel like to kill a man?
4333579 4335206 I'll tell you what.
4335289 4338751 Give me one of them cigarettes you got up<br />there and I'll tell you all about it.
4357228 4360481 So, Esmarelda...
4361816 4365194 Villa Lobos— is that Mexican?
4365278 4368489 The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian.
4368573 4371826 - That's some handle you got there, honey.<br />- Thank you.
4371909 4373870 And what is your name?
4373953 4375621 Butch.
4376289 4377498 Butch.
4378082 4379584 What does it mean?
4379667 4382169 I'm an American, honey.<br />Our names don't mean shit.
4383588 4387717 So, moving right along,<br />Esmarelda...
4387800 4390094 what is it you want to know?
4390177 4395057 - I want to know what it feels like to kill a man.<br />- I couldn't tell ya.
4400938 4403649 I didn't know he was dead<br />'til you told me he was dead.
4405443 4408279 Now that I know he's dead,<br />you wanna know how I feel about it?
4413784 4416287 I don't feel the least bit bad about it.
4428215 4429967 What the fuck'd I tell ya?
4430676 4434597 As soon as the word got out the fix was<br />in, man, the odds went through the roof.
4434680 4436891 I know. I know. Unbelievable.
4436974 4440394 Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was a better<br />boxer, he'd still be alive.
4440478 4441938 If he never laced up his gloves...
4442021 4444899 which he never shoulda done in the first<br />fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.
4446484 4450571 Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?<br />It's over now.
4450655 4453324 Yeah, well, enough about the poor,<br />unfortunate Mr. Floyd.
4453407 4456077 Let's talk about the rich<br />and prosperous Mr. Butch.
4457411 4459330 How many bookies did you lay it around on?
4460414 4462959 All eight? How long to collect?
4464502 4467421 So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?<br />No, I understand.
4467505 4470633 A few stragglers aside.<br />Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.
4470716 4472927 That is great news, man.
4473010 4476430 Yeah. No, me and Fabienne<br />are gonna leave in the morning.
4477306 4480559 It'll probably take us<br />a couple days to get down to Knoxville.
4480643 4482353 Okay, my brother.
4483688 4485982 You're right.<br />You're goddamn right.
4487066 4490569 All right, Scotty, next time I see you,<br />it'll be on Tennessee time.
4490653 4492154 Cool, brother.
4508170 4510047 $45.60.
4514385 4518848 And... here's a little something<br />for the effort.
4518931 4523477 Now... if anybody asks you who your fare<br />was tonight, what are you gonna say?
4523561 4524979 The truth.
4525062 4528858 Three well-dressed,<br />slightly toasted Mexicans.
4530943 4533320 <i>Bonsoir,</i> Esmarelda Villa Lobos.
4533404 4535948 <i>Buenas noches,</i> Butch.
4547084 4548961 Whew.
4550379 4552339 Keep the light off.
4552423 4555384 - Is that better, sugar pop?<br />- Owl
4559847 4561766 Hard day at the office?
4561849 4563768 Pretty hard.
4563851 4565478 Got in a fight.
4566145 4568314 Poor baby.
4568397 4570941 Can you make spoons?
4571025 4573110 You know what?<br />I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.
4573194 4576947 - I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.<br />- I like the way you stink.
4578032 4579950 Let me take this jacket off.
4582620 4586165 - I was looking at myself in the mirror.<br />- Uh-huh.
4586248 4588167 I wish I had a pot.
4589960 4592963 You were looking at yourself in the mirror<br />and you wish you had some pot?
4593047 4596092 A pot. A pot belly.
4596967 4599095 Pot bellies are sexy.
4599178 4601472 Well, you should be happy...
4602389 4603891 'cause you have one.
4603974 4607019 Shut up, fatso. I don't have a pot.
4607103 4610940 I have a bit of a tummy,<br />like Madonna when she did “Lucky Star.”
4611023 4612733 It's not the same thing.
4612817 4615945 I didn't know there was such a difference<br />between a pot belly and a tummy.
4616028 4617947 The difference is huge.
4620032 4622451 Would you like it if I had a pot belly?
4622535 4624203 No.
4624286 4628624 Pot bellies make a man<br />look either oafish or like a gorilla.
4628707 4632128 But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy.
4632211 4637633 The rest of you is normal— normal face,<br />normal legs, normal hips, normal ass—
4637716 4641762 but with a big, perfectly round pot belly.
4641846 4646559 If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt<br />two sizes too small to accentuate it.
4646642 4649270 You think men would find that attractive?
4649353 4652523 I don't give a damn<br />what men find attractive.
4652606 4656068 It's unfortunate what we find pleasing<br />to the touch and pleasing to the eye...
4656152 4658070 is seldom the same.
4661490 4665077 If you had a pot belly,<br />I would punch you in it.
4665161 4668080 - You'd punch me in the belly?<br />- Right in the belly.
4668164 4670082 Ohh! I'd smother you!
4670166 4674086 I'd drop it right on your face<br />'til you couldn't breathe!
4674170 4676088 - You'd do that?<br />- Yeah.
4676172 4678090 - Promise?<br />- Yeah.
4692104 4693606 Did you get everything?
4693689 4696650 - Yes, I did.<br />- Good job, sugar pop.
4696734 4698652 Did everything go as planned?
4698736 4701488 You didn't listen to the— Ow!
4701572 4703449 You didn't listen to the radio?
4703532 4706827 I never listen to your fights.<br />Were you the winner?
4706911 4709205 I won, all right.
4709288 4712249 - Are you still retiring?<br />- Sure am.
4713000 4714710 So it all worked out in the finish.
4716128 4717922 We're not at the finish yet, baby.
4727514 4729934 We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?
4731936 4734396 If they find us, they'll kill us,<br />won't they?
4736941 4738901 But they won't find us, will they?
4742780 4744990 Do you still want me to go with you?
4747284 4750955 I don't want to be<br />a burden or a nuisance. It's—
4757586 4759088 Say it.
4760673 4764677 Fabienne,<br />I want you to be with me.
4765886 4768889 - Forever?<br />- Forever and ever.
4771016 4772977 Do you love me?
4773060 4775062 Very, very much.
4780776 4783320 - Butch.<br />- Yes?
4784780 4787366 Will you give me oral pleasure?
4788867 4790828 Will you kiss it?
4792746 4794915 But you first.
4794999 4797334 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
4808053 4809305 Butch.
4829408 4831827 I think I cracked a rib.
4831910 4835331 - Giving me oral pleasure?<br />- No, retard, from the fight.
4835414 4838834 - Don't call me retard.<br />- My name is Fabby.
4838917 4841420 - My name is Fabienne!<br />- Stop it.
4841503 4843005 - Stop it!<br />- My name is Fabi—
4843088 4846425 Shut up, fuckhead!<br />I hate that mongoloid voice.
4846508 4849595 Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
4849678 4851597 I take it back.
4854600 4857519 Will you hand me a dry towel,<br />Miss Beautiful Tulip?
4857603 4861523 Oh, I like that.<br />I like being called a tulip.
4861607 4864026 Tulip is much better than mongoloid.
4864109 4867029 I didn't call you a mongoloid.<br />I called you a retard.
4867112 4869239 And I took it back.
4869323 4871408 Butch?
4871492 4873410 Yes, lemon pie?
4873494 4876914 - Where are we going to go?<br />- Well, I'm not sure yet.
4876997 4879124 Wherever you want.
4879208 4881126 We're gonna get a lot<br />of money from this...
4881210 4883379 but it ain't gonna be the kind of money...
4883462 4886799 that we can live like hogs<br />in the fathouse forever.
4887591 4891637 I was thinking maybe we could go down<br />some place in the South Pacific.
4891720 4895140 Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna<br />carry us a long way down there.
4895224 4898143 - If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?<br />- You betcha.
4898227 4901647 And if after a while you didn't dig that,<br />we could go some place else.
4901730 4904149 Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.
4904233 4906151 But I do not speak Spanish.
4906235 4909196 Well, you do not speak Bora-Boran either.
4909279 4910906 Besides, Mexican's easy.
4913450 4916245 - What does that mean?<br />- Where is the shoe store?
4917246 4918414 Spit, please.
4921792 4923585 Excellent pronunciation.
4925754 4928006 You'll be my little <i>mamacita</i> in no time.
4931718 4933887 - What time is it?<br />- What time is it?
4933971 4935472 Time for bed.
4936640 4938600 Sweet dreams, jellybean.
4946316 4947734 Butch?
4954158 4955576 Never mind.
4965752 4969840 <i>Merde!</i> You startled me.<br />Did you have a bad dream?
4980267 4982019 What is this you're watching?
4983103 4986523 A motorcycle movie.<br />I'm not sure the name.
4988442 4991528 - Are you watching it?<br />- In a way.
4994031 4996742 It's a little early in the morning<br />for explosions and war.
4999995 5001455 What was it about?
5001538 5004708 How should I know?<br />You were the one watching it.
5004791 5008795 - No, imbecile, what was your dream about?<br />- I don't know.
5008879 5010797 I don't remember.
5010881 5013759 It's really rare<br />that I remember my dreams.
5013842 5016136 Well, let's look<br />at the grumpy man in the morning.
5018889 5021600 Why don't you get up<br />and we'll get some breakfast.
5021683 5023393 One more kiss and I'll get up.
5026688 5029816 - Satisfied?<br />- Yep.
5031026 5034029 Get up, lazy bones!
5035531 5036573 God.
5037866 5041370 - What time is it?<br />- Almost 9:00 in the morning.
5041453 5045207 - What time does our train arrive?<br />- 11:00.
5045290 5048585 - You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast?<br />- What, lemon pie?
5049753 5055842 I'm gonna order a big plate of<br />blueberry pancakes with maple syrup...
5055926 5059346 eggs over easy and five sausages.
5059429 5061640 Anything to drink with that?
5061723 5064101 Wow, that looks nice.
5065435 5071275 To drink— a tall glass of orange juice<br />and a black cup of coffee.
5071358 5075904 - After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.<br />- Pie for breakfast?
5075988 5079283 Any time of the day<br />is a good time for pie.
5079992 5082452 Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes.
5082536 5085998 And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese.
5086081 5088000 Where's my watch?
5092462 5094715 It's there.
5094798 5097926 - No, it's not.<br />- Have you looked?
5098010 5100762 Yes, I've fuckin' looked.<br />What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?
5101805 5103932 You sure you got it?
5104016 5106310 Yes. Bedside table drawer.
5106393 5109521 - On the little kangaroo?<br />- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.
5109605 5112816 Yeah, well, it's not here now.
5113567 5115694 Well, it should be.
5115777 5119615 Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's<br />not here now! So where the fuck is it?
5125162 5128624 Fabienne, where's my father's<br />fucking watch?
5130292 5133837 Do you have any idea what he had to go<br />through to get me that watch?
5134379 5137215 I don't have time to go into it,<br />but he went through a lot.
5137299 5140886 All this other shit you could've set on<br />fire, but I specifically reminded you...
5140969 5144514 not to forget the fucking watch!<br />Now think.
5144598 5148101 - Did you get it?<br />- I believe so.
5148185 5151480 You believe 50? What the fuck does that<br />mean? You either did or didn't get it.
5152856 5154816 Then I did.
5156193 5158070 Are you sure?
5159696 5161156 No.
5163241 5165160 Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
5165243 5167579 Motherfucker! Motherfuckin'—
5169539 5172292 Do you know how fucking stupid<br />you fucking are?
5172376 5174336 No!
5176963 5178882 It's not your fault.
5183720 5186139 You left it at the apartment.
5191895 5194481 If you left it at the apartment,<br />it's not your fault.
5197234 5199111 I had you bring a bunch of stuff.
5202572 5204074 I reminded you about it...
5204157 5207953 but I didn't illustrate<br />how personal the watch was to me.
5209287 5212332 If all I gave a fuck about was the watch,<br />I shoulda told you that.
5213500 5215919 You're not a mind reader.
5216002 5217504 Are you?
5228932 5229975 I'm sorry.
5230058 5233645 Don't be. Just means I can't have<br />breakfast with you.
5234730 5236440 Why does it mean that?
5239025 5242320 Because I gotta go back<br />to my apartment and get my watch.
5243572 5246074 Won't the gangsters<br />be looking for you there?
5246158 5249244 Well, that's what I'm gonna find out.
5250495 5254750 If they are, and I don't think<br />I can handle it, then I'll split.
5254833 5260130 I saw your watch.<br />I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.
5266052 5268430 Here's some money.<br />Go out and get those pancakes.
5268513 5270390 Have a nice breakfast.
5270474 5273226 I'll take your Honda. I'll be back before<br />you can say blueberry pie.
5273310 5274811 Blueberry pie.
5276480 5278607 Maybe not that fast.
5278690 5281902 - But pretty fast. Okay?<br />- Okay.
5281985 5284279 - Bye.<br />- Bye.
5284362 5286948 Shit! Of all the fuckin' things<br />she could fuckin' forget...
5287032 5289034 she forgets my father's watch!
5289117 5290786 I specifically reminded her—
5290869 5293497 Bedside table, on the kangaroo.
5293580 5296833 I said the words:<br />“Don't forget my father's watch.”
5312349 5315769 <i>Visit the jackrabbit Slim's nearest you...</i>
5453782 5455700 Lookin' good, Butch.
5624828 5626871 <i>If I were walkin'<br />in your shoes</i>

5694772 5697192 - Do you think he's dead?<br />- He's dead.
5697275 5699527 - Oh, my God.<br />- He's dead.
5709412 5713333 If you need someone to go to court, I'll be<br />glad to help. That guy was a drunken maniac.
5713416 5716336 He hit you, then he crashed into that car.
5716419 5718296 - Who?<br />- Him.
5722425 5724594 I'll be damned.
5741319 5743071 I'm shot!

5779357 5781276 That's pride fuckin' with you, see?
5781359 5783319 You gotta fight through that shit!
5784862 5787865 - You'd better kill me—<br />- Yeah, somebody's gonna get killed.
5787949 5790493 Somebody's gonna get<br />their motherfuckin' head blown to—
5790576 5793079 Hold it right there, goddamn it.
5793162 5796916 - This ain't none of your business, mister.<br />- I'm makin' it my business.
5797000 5799711 - Toss the weapon.<br />- You don't understand, man.
5799794 5801838 Toss the weapon.
5803423 5807051 <i>It's time</i>
5807135 5809846 - <i>To find love</i><br />- Take your foot off the nigger.

5811931 5813975 approach the counter right now.
5814058 5816853 This motherfucker's trying to<br />kill me.

5852013 5855475 <i>Whoa, my angel</i>
5858061 5861189 <i>Down to you</i>
5899811 5903773 Nobody kills anybody in my place<br />of business except me or Zed.
5908027 5909695 That's Zed.
5922625 5925545 - I thought you said you waited for me.<br />- I did.
5930842 5933302 Then how come they're all beat up?
5934512 5937598 They did that to each other, man.<br />They came in fightin'.
5937682 5939767 Now, this 'un right here...
5939851 5942770 - he was gonna shoot that one.<br />- Is that right?
5942854 5945481 You gonna shoot him, boy?
5950153 5953197 Hey, is Grace all right out front?
5953281 5956492 - Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?<br />- No, it's Thursday.
5956576 5958244 She oughta be fine.
5961664 5964917 Well, bring out the gimp.
5966002 5968754 I think the gimp's sleepin'.
5968838 5971674 Then I guess you'll just have to go<br />wake him up now, won't you?
6011881 6013799 Get up.
6027063 6029023 Get down.
6039325 6041494 Which one of 'em you wanna do first?
6043079 6045331 I ain't for sure yet.
6049377 6052004 Eenie-meenie-minie-mo...

6435596 6438307 You hear me talkin', hillbilly boy?
6439558 6442102 I ain't through with you by a damn sight!
6442186 6444647 I'm gonna get medieval on your ass.
6448400 6451320 I meant what now between me and you.
6456408 6458327 Oh, that what now.

6481433 6482935 Two things.
6484687 6487648 Don't tell nobody about this.
6489108 6492736 This shit is between me, you...
6492820 6497282 and Mr. “Soon-to-be-livin'-the-rest<br />of-his-short-ass-life-in-agonizing-pain”...
6497366 6499284 rapist here.
6500577 6503330 It ain't nobody else's business.
6503414 6505332 Two—
6505416 6508919 You leave town tonight. Right now.
6510170 6513882 And when you gone,<br />you stay gone...
6513966 6515884 or you be gone.
6516885 6519680 You lost all your LA privileges. Deal?
6521932 6523267 Deal.
6525102 6527062 Get your ass outta here.
6553505 6555424 Oh, shit.
6588957 6590501 Fabienne!
6592294 6593712 Fabienne!
6596632 6598717 Fabienne! Come on, baby.
6598801 6600677 Come on. Get your shit.<br />We gotta go right now.
6600761 6602387 I was so worried.<br />What about our bags?
6602471 6604723 Fuck the bags; if we don't split<br />right now, we'll miss the train.
6604807 6607726 - Come on, I'll be downstairs.<br />- Is everything well?
6607810 6611438 - Just come on! No talking now!<br />- Are we in danger?
6615067 6616652 Come on, honey!
6619738 6621657 Where did you get this motorcycle?
6621740 6624201 It's not a motorcycle, baby.<br />It's a chopper. Let's go.
6624284 6626245 What happened to my Honda?
6626328 6630082 I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that<br />Honda. Will you come on now, please?
6630165 6632626 Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.
6637131 6638090 You're hurt?
6638173 6640592 No, no, I might've broken<br />my nose. It's no biggie.
6640676 6643595 Come on. Hop on. Baby, please, we—
6643679 6646473 Honey, we gotta hit<br />the fuckin' road! Get on!
6648308 6652437 Oh, baby, I'm sorry.<br />Come here, come here. I'm sorry.
6653730 6655232 I'm so sorry.
6655315 6657734 You were gone so long,<br />I started to think dreadful thoughts.
6657818 6660737 I didn't mean to worry you.<br />Everything's fine.
6660821 6662739 - How was your breakfast?<br />- It was good.
6662823 6664741 Did you get the blueberry pancakes?
6664825 6667744 They didn't have blueberry; I had to get<br />buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?
6667828 6670747 Since I left you, this has been,<br />without a doubt...
6670831 6675043 the single weirdest fuckin' day<br />of my life— I'll tell you all about it.
6675127 6676920 Gotta go. Come on.
6677004 6679798 Butch, whose motorcycle is this?
6679882 6682467 - It's a chopper, baby.<br />- Whose chopper is this?
6682551 6684469 - Zed's.<br />- Who's Zed?
6684553 6687472 Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.
6703280 6705574 Yes, you did, Brett!
6705657 6709161 You tried to fuck him, and Marsellus<br />Wallace don't liked to be fucked...
6709244 6711663 by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
6711747 6714833 - Oh, God, please, I don't wanna die.<br />- You read the Bible, Brett?
6714917 6718337 - Yes!<br />- Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
6718420 6720589 Sorta fits the occasion.
6720672 6723967 Ezekiel 25:17.
6724051 6728347 “The path of the righteous man<br />is beset on all sides...
6728430 6733644 by the inequities of the selfish<br />and the tyranny of evil men.
6733727 6738565 Blessed is he who, in the name<br />of charity and good will...
6738649 6741693 shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness...
6741777 6744279 for he is truly his brother's keeper...
6744363 6747074 and the finder of lost children.
6747157 6753664 And I will strike down upon thee<br />with great vengeance and furious anger...
6753747 6758126 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy my brothers.
6758210 6762047 And you will know my name is the Lord...
6762130 6765509 when I lay my vengeance upon thee.”
6773600 6776061 I'm fucked. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
6776144 6779064 - Is he a friend of yours?<br />- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.
6779147 6781733 Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.
6781817 6783568 Better tell him to shut up.<br />He's gettin' on my nerves.
6783652 6786446 Marvin. Marvin. Marvin!
6786530 6788824 I'd knock that shit off if I was you.
6789408 6792577 Die, you motherfuckers! Die!
6820731 6824151 Why the fuck didn't you<br />tell us somebody was in the bathroom?
6824234 6827112 Slip your mind? Did you forget that<br />someone was in there...
6827195 6829072 with a goddamn hand cannon?
6829156 6832367 You see the size of that gun<br />he fired at us? It was bigger than him.
6837873 6840584 We should be fuckin' dead, man.
6840667 6842586 I know. We was lucky.
6842669 6845756 No, no, no, no. That shit wasn't luck.
6845839 6847174 Yeah, maybe.
6847257 6850052 This was divine intervention.
6850135 6852054 You know what divine intervention is?
6857934 6859853 I think so.
6859936 6863357 That means that God came down from heaven<br />and stopped the bullets.
6863440 6865859 That's right.<br />That's exactly what it means.
6865942 6868904 God came down from heaven<br />and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.
6870155 6872115 I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.
6872199 6874576 Don't do that.<br />Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!
6874659 6876745 What just happened here<br />was a fuckin' miracle!
6876828 6878622 Chill. This shit happens.
6878705 6881458 Wrong! Wrong. This shit<br />doesn't just happen.
6881541 6884961 Do you want to continue<br />this theological discussion in a car...
6885045 6887506 or in a jailhouse with the cops?
6887589 6889257 We should be fuckin' dead, my friend!
6890092 6894471 What happened here was a miracle,<br />and I want you to fucking acknowledge it!
6894554 6898809 All right, it was a miracle.<br />Can we go now?
6906274 6909361 Let's go, nigger! Come on! Shit.
6911405 6913365 You ever seen that show <i>Cops?</i>
6913448 6916368 I was watching it one time<br />and there was this cop on...
6916451 6920372 and he was talkin' about this gunfight he<br />had in the hallway with this guy, right?
6920455 6923875 He just unloaded on this guy and nothin'<br />happened. He didn't hit nothin'.
6923959 6926503 Okay? It was just him and this guy.
6926586 6930298 I mean, you know,<br />it's freaky, but it happens.
6930382 6932759 You wanna play blind man,<br />go walk with the shepherd...
6932843 6935303 but me, my eyes<br />are wide fuckin' open.
6935387 6937097 What the fuck does that mean?
6937180 6938682 It means that's it for me.
6938765 6941059 From here on in, you can<br />consider my ass retired.
6941143 6943311 - Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.<br />- Don't blaspheme.
6943395 6946440 - I said, don't do that!<br />- Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us?
6946523 6949568 Look, I'm tellin'<br />Marsellus today— I'm through.
6949651 6952571 - Why don't you tell him at the same time why?<br />- Don't worry, I will.
6952654 6956658 - And I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass off.<br />- I don't give a damn if he does.
6957409 6959828 Marvin, what do you make of all this?
6959911 6962330 Man, I don't even have an opinion.
6962414 6966668 You gotta have an opinion. You think God<br />came down from heaven and stopped—
6967335 6968920 What the fuck's happenin'?
6969004 6970714 - Shit, man!<br />- Man!
6970797 6973717 - Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.<br />- Why the fuck'd you do that?
6973800 6975427 I didn't mean it. It was an accident.
6975510 6977971 Man, I seen some crazy-ass<br />shit in my time, but this—
6978054 6981725 Chill out, man! It was an accident.<br />We probably went over a bump or somethin'.
6981808 6983727 The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump.
6983810 6987105 I didn't mean to shoot<br />the son of a bitch. The gun went off.
6987189 6990609 Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on a city<br />street in broad daylight here!
6990692 6992611 - I don't believe it!<br />- We", believe it now, motherfucker!
6992694 6997157 We gotta get this car off the road. Cops<br />notice shit like a car drenched in blood.
6997240 7000160 - Just take it to a friendly place, that's all!<br />- This is the Valley, Vincent.
7000243 7002662 Marsellus ain't got<br />no friendly places in the Valley.
7002746 7005165 - Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man!<br />- Shit!
7005248 7007667 - What you doing?<br />- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.
7007751 7011254 - Where's Toluca Lake?<br />- Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.
7011922 7014799 If Jimmie's ass ain't home,<br />I don't know what the fuck we gonna do...
7014883 7017302 'cause I ain't got<br />no other partners in 818.
7017385 7021306 Jimmie, how you doin', man?<br />It's Jules. Just listen up, man.
7021389 7025310 Me and my homeboy are in a car,<br />and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.
7025393 7027562 I need to use your garage<br />for a couple hours.
7029064 7031983 We gotta be real fuckin' delicate<br />with this Jimmie situation.
7032067 7034694 He's one remark away<br />from kickin' our asses out the door.
7034778 7038698 - If he does, what do we do?<br />- We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls...
7038782 7041701 but I don't want it to reach that pitch—<br />Jimmie's a friend.
7041785 7043912 You don't come into your friend's house<br />and start tellin' him what's what.
7043995 7046206 Just tell him not to be abusive.
7046289 7048708 He kinda freaked out back there<br />when he saw Marvin.
7048792 7051962 Put yourself in his position—<br />It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.
7052045 7053964 He wasn't expectin' this shit.
7054047 7056967 We gotta remember here<br />who's doin' who a favor.
7057050 7060887 If that favor means I gotta take shit, he<br />can stick that favor straight up his ass.
7060971 7063390 Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd<br />you just do to his towel, man?
7063473 7064975 I was dryin' my hands!
7065058 7067978 - You're supposed to wash 'em first!<br />- You watched me wash 'em.
7068061 7071314 - I watched you get 'em wet.<br />- I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.
7071398 7073608 Maybe if he'd had Lava<br />I coulda done a better job.
7073692 7075610 I used the same fuckin' soap you did...
7075694 7078613 and when I finished, the towel didn't look<br />like no goddamn maxi-pad!
7078697 7080865 What if he was to come in here<br />and see his towel like this?
7080949 7084244 It's shit like this that's gonna bring<br />this situation to a head, man!
7085870 7089291 Look, I ain't threatenin' you<br />or nothin', all right?
7089374 7093837 You know I respect you and all. But just<br />don't put me in this position, all right?
7093920 7096590 All right. Fine. Fine.
7096673 7098842 Ask me nice like that, no problem.
7099676 7102637 Just go handle your friend.<br />Go ahead. I don't care.
7105473 7107225 Goddamn, Jimmie!
7107309 7109352 This some serious gourmet shit.
7109436 7113398 Me and Vincent would've been satisfied<br />with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.
7113481 7117902 Right? And he springs this<br />serious gourmet shit on us.
7117986 7120530 - What flavor is this?<br />- Knock it off, Julie.
7120614 7121573 What?
7121656 7124659 I don't need you to tell me<br />how fuckin' good my coffee is.
7124743 7127245 I'm the one who buys it.<br />I know how good it is.
7127329 7129205 When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.
7129289 7132917 I buy the gourmet expensive stuff<br />'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
7133001 7136921 But you know what's on my mind right now?<br />It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.
7137005 7139174 It's the dead nigger in my garage.
7139257 7140967 Jimmie, don't even worry—
7141051 7143094 Don't tell me about anything.<br />I wanna ask you a question.
7143178 7144679 When you came pulling in here...
7144763 7147932 did you notice the sign on the front of my<br />house that said, “Dead nigger storage”?
7148016 7149726 You know I ain't seen no—
7149809 7153480 Did you notice the sign on the front of<br />my house that said, “Dead nigger storage”?
7154147 7156274 No. I didn't.
7156358 7159235 - You know why you didn't see that sign?<br />- Why?
7159319 7163865 'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead<br />niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!
7163948 7166868 - We're not gonna store the motherfucker—<br />- Don't you fuckin' realize...
7166951 7171373 that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead<br />body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?
7171456 7174668 No marriage counselor. No trial separation.<br />I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.
7174751 7178088 Okay? And I don't wanna<br />get fuckin' divorced!
7178171 7183176 Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,<br />but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.
7183259 7185345 Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain't gonna leave you.
7185428 7189349 Don't fuckin' “Jimmie” me,<br />Jules! Okay? Don't fuckin' “Jimmie” me.
7189432 7193395 There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna<br />make me forget I love my wife. Is there?
7195939 7201194 Now, look, you know, she comes home<br />from work in about an hour and a half.
7201277 7203905 The graveyard shift at the hospital.
7203988 7207492 You gotta make some phone calls?<br />You gotta call some people?
7207575 7211496 Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck<br />out of my house before she gets here.
7211579 7214416 That's Kool and the Gang.<br />We don't wanna fuck your shit up.
7214499 7217502 All I wanna do is call my people<br />and get 'em to bring us in.
7217585 7220505 You're fucking my shit up right now!
7220588 7223675 You're gonna fuck my shit up<br />big time if Bonnie comes home.
7223758 7227262 Do me that favor, all right? The phone is<br />in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.
7227345 7230265 Well, say she comes home.
7230348 7231975 What do you think she'll do?
7234269 7236688 Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.
7236771 7238982 That ain't no kinda answer.
7239065 7242110 I mean, you know, I don't.<br />How much? A lot or a little?
7242193 7247031 You got to appreciate what an explosive<br />element this Bonnie situation is.
7247115 7251035 <i>She comes home from a hard day's work,<br />finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen...</i>
7251119 7253037 <i>doing a bunch of gangster shit...</i>
7253121 7256207 <i>there ain't no tellin'<br />what she's liable to do.</i>
7258376 7260295 Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.
7260378 7262964 All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs.
7263047 7265091 I don't wanna hear about<br />no motherfuckin' ifs!
7265175 7266843 All I want to hear from your ass is...
7266926 7269971 “You ain't got no problem, Jules,<br />I'm on the motherfucker.
7270054 7274184 Chill them niggers out and wait for the<br />cavalry, which should be coming directly.”
7274267 7277437 You ain't got no problem, Jules.
7277520 7279647 I'm on the motherfucker.
7279731 7284819 Chill them niggers out and wait for the<br />Wolf, who should be coming directly.
7285528 7287280 You sendin' the Wolf?
7287363 7289532 Oh, you feel better, motherfucker?
7289616 7291910 Shit, negro!
7291993 7294120 That's all you had to say!
7295163 7297165 She the hysterical type?
7298458 7300001 When is she due?
7303630 7305548 Give me the principals' names again.
7305632 7307550 Place your bets.
7308635 7311012 - Jules.<br />- Cards, please.
7312347 7314307 Vincent.
7319020 7320522 Jimmie.
7322190 7323566 Bonnie.
7329739 7332700 It's 30 minutes away. I'll be there in 10.
7349676 7352595 You're... Jimmie, right?<br />This is your house?
7352679 7356307 - It sure is.<br />- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.
7356391 7359310 - Good. We got one.<br />- So I heard. May I come in?
7359394 7361271 Yeah. Please do.
7361354 7365024 You must be Jules.<br />Which would make you... Vincent.
7365108 7367527 Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.
7367610 7370321 If I was informed correctly, the clock<br />is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?
7370405 7371865 One hundred percent.
7371948 7375368 Your wife Bonnie comes home<br />at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?
7375451 7376536 Uh-huh.
7376619 7381124 I was led to believe if she comes home and<br />finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much.
7381207 7382667 She wouldn't at that.
7382750 7385461 That gives us 40 minutes<br />to get the fuck outta Dodge...
7385545 7389007 which, if you do what I say, when I say it,<br />should be plenty.
7389090 7393428 Now, you got a corpse in a car,<br />minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.
7401144 7403062 - Jimmie.<br />- Uh-huh.
7403146 7406190 Do me a favor, will ya?<br />Thought I smelled some coffee back there.
7406274 7410111 - Would you make me a cup?<br />- Yeah, sure.
7411571 7414490 Oh, how do you take it?
7414574 7416117 Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
7419495 7422248 About the car, is there anything<br />I need to know? Does it stall?
7422332 7425627 Does it smoke? Does it<br />make a lot of noise? Is there gas in it?
7425710 7429339 - Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.<br />- Positive?
7429422 7432133 Don't get me on the road and I find out<br />the brake lights don't work.
7432216 7435303 As far as I know,<br />the motherfucker's tip-top.
7435386 7437263 Good enough.
7437347 7439349 Let's go back to the kitchen.
7445021 7447482 - Here you go, Mr. Wolf.<br />- Thank you, Jimmie.
7455823 7457909 Okay, first thing. You two.
7457992 7460370 Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
7460453 7463122 Now, Jimmie, this looks to be<br />a pretty domesticated house.
7463206 7466584 That would lead me to believe<br />you got cleansers and shit.
7466668 7467752 Yeah. Under the sink.
7467835 7471255 Good. What I need you two fellas to do is<br />take those cleaning products...
7471339 7475343 and clean the inside<br />of the car— I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.
7475426 7479347 Go in the back seat, scoop up all those<br />little pieces of brain and skull.
7479430 7481849 Get it out of there.<br />Wipe down the upholstery.
7481933 7485353 It don't need to be spick-and-span.<br />You don't need to eat off it.
7485436 7489774 Just give it a good once-over. What you need<br />to take care of are the really messy parts.
7489857 7493945 The pools of blood that have collected,<br />you gotta soak that shit up.
7494028 7496447 We need to raid your linen closet.
7496531 7499450 I need blankets,<br />I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.
7499534 7503162 The thicker the better, the darker<br />the better. No whites. Can't use 'em.
7503246 7508543 We'll need to camouflage the front seat<br />and back seat and floorboards...
7508626 7510545 with quilts and blankets...
7510628 7514549 so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout<br />in the car, the subterfuge won't last...
7514632 7517468 but at a glance the car<br />will appear to be normal.
7517552 7519595 Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work.
7519679 7521431 Please would be nice.
7522890 7525893 - Come again?<br />- I said, a please would be nice.
7527729 7531607 Get it straight, Buster. I'm not here to say<br />please. I'm here to tell you what to do.
7533401 7535528 And if self-preservation<br />is an instinct you possess...
7535611 7538322 you'd better fuckin' do it<br />and do it quick.
7538406 7542785 I'm here to help. If my help's not<br />appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.
7542869 7545663 No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;<br />your help is definitely appreciated.
7545747 7549167 Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't<br />mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.
7549250 7552086 I just don't like people<br />barkin' orders at me.
7552170 7555173 If I'm curt with you,<br />it's because time is a factor.
7555256 7559886 I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys<br />to act fast if you wanna get out of this.
7559969 7563431 So pretty please,<br />with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.
7567935 7571064 Don't be lookin' at me like that,<br />all right? I can feel your look.
7574317 7576986 It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
7579072 7580490 Green.
7582617 7584786 Nothin' except for the mess inside.
7587747 7590166 About 20 minutes.
7591667 7593628 Nobody who'll be missed.
7595671 7598633 You're a good man, Joe. Thanks a bunch.
7599717 7603638 - How we comin', Jimmie?<br />- Pretty good. I got it all here, but...
7604972 7606599 Mr. Wolf, you gotta<br />understand something.
7606682 7608392 Winston, Jimmie, Winston.
7608476 7611979 Okay. You gotta understand<br />something, Winston.
7612063 7613981 No, thank you.
7614065 7617193 This is our best linen here...
7617276 7622365 and it was a wedding present<br />from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny.
7622448 7624784 They're not with us anymore.<br />I wanna help—
7624867 7628454 Let me ask you a question.<br />If you don't mind.
7628538 7630206 No, no, please. Go ahead.
7631791 7636671 Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,<br />were they millionaires?
7637839 7639340 No.
7639423 7642260 Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.
7642343 7645763 And I'm positive<br />that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...
7645847 7648266 - Ginny.<br />- Ginny were here...
7648349 7652603 they would furnish you<br />with a whole bedroom set...
7652687 7655857 which your Uncle Marsellus<br />is more than happy to do.
7659819 7663739 I like oak myself.<br />That's what I have in my bedroom.
7664866 7666826 How about you, Jimmie?
7668035 7669996 You an oak man?
7671080 7673040 Oak's nice.
7678880 7682717 Oh, man, I will never<br />forgive your ass for this shit.
7682800 7685219 This is some fucked-up, repugnant shit.
7685303 7688723 Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy<br />that once a man admits that he is wrong...
7688806 7691726 that he is immediately forgiven<br />for all wrongdoings?
7691809 7694228 Get the fuck out my face with that shit!
7694312 7697148 The motherfucker that said that shit never<br />had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...
7697231 7698649 on account of your dumb ass.
7698733 7701485 I got a threshold, Jules,<br />for the abuse that I will take.
7701569 7704822 Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,<br />and you got me in the red.
7704906 7708659 I'm just ea yin' it's fuckin' dangerous<br />to have a race car in the fuckin' red.
7708743 7710661 That's all. I could blow.
7710745 7712663 - Oh, you ready to blow?<br />- Yeah.
7712747 7715666 Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'<br />motherfucker, motherfucker.
7715750 7718669 Every time my fingers touch brain,<br />I'm Superfly TNT.
7718753 7720671 I'm the Guns of the Navarone.
7720755 7723174 In fact, what the fuck<br />am I doin' in the back?
7723257 7727011 You're the motherfucker should be on brain<br />detail! We're fuckin' switchin'!
7727094 7729555 I'm washin' windows,<br />you're pickin' up this nigger's skull!
7739273 7741234 Fine job, gentlemen.
7742568 7744487 You may get out of this yet.
7744570 7746989 I can't believe this is the same car.
7747073 7750701 Well, let's not start suckin'<br />each other's dicks quite yet.
7750785 7754330 Phase one is complete— clean the car—<br />which moves us right along to phase two:
7754413 7756499 clean you two.
7758084 7759961 Strip.
7760044 7762755 - All the way?<br />- To your bare ass.
7763881 7766926 Quickly, gentlemen.<br />We got about 15 minutes...
7767009 7769929 before Jimmie's better half<br />comes pulling into the driveway.
7770012 7772515 Goddamn, this morning air<br />is some chilly shit.
7772598 7774517 Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
7774600 7777019 - You know what you two look like?<br />- What?
7777103 7779438 Like a couple of guys<br />who just blew off somebody's head.
7780606 7783985 Strippin' off those bloody rags<br />is absolutely necessary.
7788281 7790116 Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.
7790199 7795246 Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit<br />out front for the garbageman to pick up.
7795329 7799542 Don't worry,<br />we're taking it with us. Jim, the soap.
7801002 7802920 - Vincent.<br />- Okay, gentlemen.
7803004 7806507 You both been to county before,<br />I'm sure. Here it comes.
7806590 7809468 - Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!<br />- Yo! Yo! Yo!
7809552 7812763 Better you than me, gentlemen.
7812847 7815766 Don't be afraid of the soap.<br />Spread it around.
7815850 7818728 - Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's hair.<br />- Hey, get out of my hair!
7818811 7821689 Come on, do it, goddamn it! Do it!
7822773 7824191 Towel.
7835202 7838372 You're dry enough. Toss 'em their clothes.
7839957 7841751 Perfect.
7841834 7844253 Perfect. We couldn't have<br />planned this better.
7845338 7847256 You guys look like—
7847340 7849759 What do they look like, Jimmie?
7849842 7853554 Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.
7854513 7857016 Ha-ha-ha. They're your clothes,<br />motherfucker.
7857099 7859810 Come on, gentlemen.<br />We're laughing our way right into prison.
7859894 7861854 Don't make me beg.
7864899 7868319 Okay, gentlemen,<br />let's get our rules of the road straight.
7868402 7870905 We're going to a place<br />called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.
7871530 7874950 Now, Monster Joe and his daughter<br />Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma.
7875034 7876911 The place is North Hollywood...
7876994 7880998 so a few twists and turns aside,<br />we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.
7881082 7884418 Now, I'll drive the tainted car.<br />Jules, you ride with me.
7885795 7887755 Vincent, you follow in my Acura.
7887838 7891717 Now, if we come across the path<br />of any John Q. Laws...
7891801 7894929 - nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something.<br />- Right.
7895012 7897890 - What did I say?<br />- Don't do shit unless.
7897973 7900267 - Unless what?<br />- Unless you do it first.
7900351 7902728 Spoken like a true prodigy.
7902812 7906232 How about you, Lash La Rue? Can you keep<br />your spurs from jingling and jangling?
7906315 7910444 The gun went off.<br />I don't know why. I'm cool, I promise you.
7910528 7913447 Fair enough. Now, I drive real<br />fuckin' fast, so keep up.
7913531 7916033 If I get my car back any<br />different than I gave it...
7916117 7918994 Monster Joe's gonna be<br />disposing of two bodies.
7922873 7924583 Outta my way, Rex.
7926127 7928546 - We cool?<br />- Like it never happened.
7928629 7932383 - All right.<br />- Boys, this is Raquel.
7932466 7935094 Someday all this will be hers.
7935177 7938013 Hi. So, what's with the outfits?
7938097 7940474 You guys going to a volleyball game<br />or something?
7942643 7944562 I'm takin' milady out to breakfast.
7944645 7946856 Maybe I could drop you two off.<br />Where do you live?
7946939 7948315 - Redondo.<br />- Inglewood.
7948399 7951819 It's your future.
7951902 7954655 I see a cab ride.
7954738 7957700 Move outta the sticks, fellas.<br />Say good night, Raquel.
7957783 7960703 - Good night, Raquel.<br />- I'll see you guys around.
7960786 7962413 Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.
7962496 7966208 Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was<br />a real pleasure watching you work.
7966292 7968961 Yeah, really. And thank<br />you very much, Mr. Wolf.
7970296 7972214 Call me Winston.
7973799 7976719 You see that, young lady? Respect.
7976802 7980973 - Respect for one's elders shows character.<br />- I have character.
7981056 7985060 Because you are a character doesn't<br />mean that you have character.
7992651 7994612 Wanna share a cab?
7994695 7998949 I'd go for some breakfast.<br />Feel like havin' breakfast with me?
7999033 8000326 Cool.
8005831 8008959 I don't know why, I just thought<br />he'd be European or something.
8009043 8011128 Yeah, he's about as European<br />as fuckin' English Bob.
8011212 8013464 - I know that now.<br />- But was he cool or what?
8013547 8017468 - Thank you.<br />- Totally fuckin' cool, in control.
8017551 8021597 Didn't even really get pissed when you<br />were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.
8022681 8024266 Want some bacon?
8024350 8027102 - No, man, I don't eat pork.<br />- Are you Jewish?
8027186 8029772 I ain't Jewish; I just don't<br />dig on swine, that's all.
8029855 8032775 - Why not?<br />- Pigs are filthy animals.
8032858 8034777 I don't eat filthy animals.
8034860 8038280 Yeah, but bacon tastes good.<br />Pork chops taste good.
8038364 8041283 Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,<br />but I'd never know...
8041367 8043118 'cause I wouldn't eat<br />the filthy motherfuckers.
8044370 8047289 Pigs sleep and root in shit.<br />That's a filthy animal.
8047373 8051043 I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense<br />enough to disregard its own feces.
8051126 8053671 How about a dog?<br />Dog eats its own feces.
8053754 8055673 I don't eat dog either.
8055756 8059093 Yeah, but do you consider<br />a dog to be a filthy animal?
8059176 8061804 I wouldn't go so far<br />as to calla dog filthy...
8061887 8063681 but they're definitely dirty.
8063764 8066725 But a dog's got personality.<br />Personality goes a long way.
8066809 8068310 So, by that rationale...
8068394 8072731 if a pig had a better personality, he would<br />cease to be a filthy animal, is that true?
8072815 8075943 We'd have to be talkin' about<br />one charming motherfuckin' pig.
8076026 8080072 I mean, he'd have to be 10 times more<br />charming than that Arnold on <i>Green Acres.</i>
8085661 8087788 Oh, man, that's good.
8087871 8091458 That's good, man.<br />You're startin' to lighten up.
8091542 8093961 You've been sittin' there,<br />all serious and shit.
8094044 8097006 - I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.<br />- About what?
8097089 8098549 About the miracle we witnessed.
8098632 8101927 Miracle you witnessed.<br />I witnessed a freak occurrence.
8102011 8103345 What is a miracle, Vincent?
8105306 8108475 - Act of God.<br />- And what's an act of God?
8111979 8115816 When God makes<br />the impossible possible.
8116817 8118736 But this morning...
8118819 8121530 - I don't think qualifies.<br />- Hey, Vincent.
8121614 8125326 See, that shit don't matter.<br />You're judging this shit the wrong way.
8125409 8130331 It could be God stopped the bullets,<br />changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.
8130414 8133375 You don't judge shit<br />like this based on merit.
8133459 8135919 Now, whether or not what we experienced...
8136003 8139131 was an According-to-Hoyle<br />miracle is insignificant.
8139214 8142968 But what is significant is,<br />I felt the touch of God.
8143052 8144970 God got involved.
8145054 8146764 But why?
8146847 8149892 Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:<br />I don't know why.
8149975 8152936 - But I can't go back to sleep.<br />- You're serious.
8153020 8154897 You're really thinkin' about quittin'.
8154980 8157650 - For life? Most definitely.<br />- Yeah.
8157733 8161070 Fuck. What you gonna do then?
8162404 8166617 Well, that's what I been<br />sitting here contemplating.
8166700 8170287 First I'm gonna deliver<br />this case to Marsellus.
8170371 8173457 Then, basically, I'm just<br />gonna walk the earth.
8173540 8176960 - What you mean, “Walk the earth”?<br />- Like Caine in <i>Kung Fu</i>.
8177044 8180005 Walk from place to place,<br />meet people, get in adventures.
8180089 8182341 And how long do you intend<br />to walk the earth?
8182424 8185719 - 'Til God puts me where he wants me to be.<br />- What if he don't do that?
8185803 8188180 If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever.
8188263 8190724 So you decided to be a bum.
8190808 8194436 I'll just be Jules, Vincent.<br />No more, no less.
8194520 8196480 No, Jules, you decided to be a bum...
8196563 8199858 just like all those pieces of shit out<br />there who beg for change...
8199942 8202861 who sleep in garbage bins,<br />eat what I throw away.
8202945 8205906 They got a name for that, Jules—<br />It's called a bum.
8205989 8209660 And without a job, a residence or legal<br />tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.
8209743 8211620 You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.
8211704 8214623 Look, my friend,<br />this is just where you and I differ.
8214707 8217543 Garcon! Coffee!
8217626 8222131 Jules, look, what happened this morning,<br />man, I agree it was peculiar.
8222214 8225300 - But water into wine, I—<br />- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.
8225384 8228512 - Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.<br />- If my answers frighten you...
8228595 8231140 then you should cease<br />asking scary questions.
8234059 8235978 I'm gonna take a shit.
8239857 8241400 Let me ask you something.
8241483 8244862 When did you make this decision, when you<br />were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?
8244945 8248866 Yeah. I was sittin' here eatin' my muffin,<br />drinkin' my coffee...
8248949 8250868 replayin' the incident in my head...
8250951 8254788 when I had what alcoholics refer to<br />as a moment of clarity.
8255414 8257958 Fuck. To be continued.
8269970 8272931 - I love you, pumpkin.<br />- I love you, honey bunny.
8274516 8276602 Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!
8276685 8279313 Any one of you fucking pricks move...
8279396 8282524 and I'll execute every one<br />of you motherfuckers!
8282608 8285986 You got that?<br />You just be quiet over there!
8286069 8289114 Get on the fuckin'— get the fuck down!
8289198 8293911 You're in a blind spot. Take your dames<br />over to that booth, on the count of ten!
8293994 8298540 - Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!<br />- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8—
8298624 8301710 What the fuck are you doing,<br />you fucking yuppie? Get down!
8301794 8304254 - Get down!<br />- Th row those bags!

8306924 8309176 Move! Get the fuck—
8309259 8312262 Get down on the fucking floor!
8312346 8314264 Grandpa! Down!
8314348 8317726 I'm the manager here,<br />and there's no problem. No problem at all.
8317810 8320729 - You gonna give me a problem?<br />- No, sir, I'm not.
8320813 8324817 Thought you said you were gonna give me<br />a fucking problem!
8324900 8329571 - I think we got a hero here, honey bunny.<br />- Well, just execute him!
8330197 8331949 I am not a hero.
8332032 8334701 - I'm just a coffee shop manager.<br />- Get the fuck down!
8334785 8336537 The restaurant's ours!
8336620 8339540 Just take whatever you want.
8339623 8341542 - You talk to the customers.<br />- Yeah.
8341625 8344753 You tell them to be fucking cool<br />and everything will be over.
8344837 8346797 - You understand me?<br />- Yes!
8349091 8352970 Listen, everybody. Be calm, cooperate...
8353053 8355973 and this'll all be over in a minute!
8356056 8358058 Get the fuck down! Well done.
8370362 8373824 All right, now, people, gonna come around<br />and collect your wallets!
8373907 8377327 You don't fucking talk, you just throw 'em<br />in the bag! Are we clear?
8377411 8379663 I said, are we fucking clear?
8379746 8381623 Good! Now, wallets out!
8383333 8386336 That's it.<br />Get the fuck down. In the bag.
8386420 8389339 - In the fucking bag!<br />- I don't have nothin' on me, man.
8389423 8391258 In the bag.
8392050 8394261 What am I waiting for? In the fucking bag.
8394344 8397264 Laura. Laura. Tips. In the bag.
8398098 8399558 - Is that a cellular phone?<br />- Yeah.
8399641 8401184 In the fucking bag.
8403145 8406607 Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.<br />Now get the fuck down on the floor.
8406690 8409109 In the bag. In the bag.
8421288 8423248 In the bag.
8438347 8441266 - What's in the case?<br />- My boss' dirty laundry.
8441350 8443894 - Your boss makes you do his laundry?<br />- When he wants it clean.
8443977 8446647 - Sounds like a shit job.<br />- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.
8446730 8449650 - Open it.<br />- 'Fraid I can't do that.
8451693 8454029 - I didn't hear you.<br />- Yes, you did.
8455155 8457449 What's going on?
8457532 8459409 Looks like we got<br />a vigilante in our midst.
8459493 8460994 Shoot him in the face!
8461078 8464790 I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't<br />the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.
8464873 8467250 If you don't take your hand off<br />that case, it'll be your last.
8467334 8468585 Stop causing problems!
8468669 8471129 You'll get us all killed! Give 'em what<br />you got and get 'em outta here!
8471213 8475425 Shut the fuck up, fat man!<br />This ain't none of your goddamn business!
8475509 8477761 Be cool, honey bunny, be cool.
8477844 8479888 No problem. I got it under control.
8481515 8483517 Now, I'm gonna count to three.
8485102 8489022 If you don't open that case,<br />I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.
8493443 8494861 We clear?
8498532 8500450 One.
8502285 8504788 Two.
8504871 8506915 - Three.<br />- Okay, Ringo.
8506999 8509084 You win.
8509167 8511086 It's yours.
8516133 8517884 Open it.
8521722 8523932 Hey, what is it?
8524016 8526351 What is it?
8526435 8529062 Is that what I think it is?
8533400 8535485 It's beautiful.
8535569 8538113 Goddamn it, what is it?
8539614 8542534 You let him go! You let him go!
8542617 8545579 - Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!<br />- Tell that bitch to be cool.
8545662 8548582 - Say, “Bitch, be cool!” Say, “Bitch, be cool!”<br />- Be cool! Be cool!
8548665 8551376 - Tell that bitch to chill!<br />- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!
8551460 8554337 - Chill that fuckin' bitch out!<br />- Chill out, honey bunny!
8554421 8556214 - Let go of him!<br />- Chill out, honey bunny!
8556298 8559217 - Now, promise her it's gonna be all right!<br />- I promise!
8559301 8561178 - Tell her to chill!<br />- Chill out, honey bunny!
8561261 8563180 - Now tell me her name.<br />- Yolanda.
8563263 8566683 All right, now, Yolanda, we're not gonna<br />do anything stupid, are we?
8566767 8569686 - Don't you hurt him!<br />- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!
8569770 8573273 We're all gonna be like three little<br />Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?
8573356 8577027 - Come on, Yolanda! What's Fonzie like?<br />- He's cool.
8577110 8578987 - What?<br />- Cool.
8579071 8581907 Correctamundo.<br />And that's what we're gonna be.
8581990 8583909 We're gonna be cool.
8583992 8588872 Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three.
8588955 8591041 And when I count three...
8591124 8594044 I want you to let go of your gun...
8594127 8597631 put your palms flat on the table<br />and sit your ass down.
8598673 8600717 And when you do it...
8600801 8602886 you do it cool.
8602969 8605263 You ready?
8605347 8607432 One...
8607516 8609726 two...
8609810 8611728 three.
8618693 8621822 - Okay, now you let him go!<br />- Yolanda!
8621905 8625492 I thought you were gonna be cool. Now,<br />when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.
8625575 8627661 When I get nervous, I get scared.
8627744 8631540 When motherfuckers get scared, that's when<br />motherfuckers accidentally get shot.
8633208 8636837 Just know, you hurt him, you die.
8636920 8640298 Well, that seems to be the situation.
8640382 8642300 But I don't want that.
8642384 8644302 And you don't want that.
8644386 8647097 And Ringo here definitely<br />doesn't want that.
8647180 8649307 So let's see what we can do.
8651101 8654938 Now... here's the situation.
8655021 8658859 Normally both your asses<br />would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken...
8658942 8661862 but you happened to pull this shit<br />while I'm in a transitional period...
8661945 8664364 and I don't wanna kill you;<br />I wanna help you.
8664447 8669202 But I can't give you this case,<br />'cause it don't belong to me.
8669286 8672372 Besides, I been through too much shit<br />over this case this morning...
8672455 8675375 to just hand it over to your dumb ass.
8675458 8677294 Vincent!
8677377 8680297 - Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.<br />- Get back!
8680380 8683091 It's cool! We still just talkin'.
8683175 8686595 Come on. Point the gun at me.<br />Point the gun at me.
8686678 8689472 There you go.<br />Now, Vincent, you just hang back...
8689556 8691474 and don't do a goddamn thing.
8691558 8693476 Tell her it's still cool.
8693560 8696438 - It's still cool, honey bunny.<br />- How we doin', baby?
8697898 8700525 I gotta go pee.
8700609 8702527 I wanna go home.
8702611 8706198 Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.<br />And Ringo's proud of you.
8706281 8709201 It's almost over.<br />Tell her you're proud of her.
8709284 8712621 - I'm proud of you, honey bunny.<br />- I love you.
8712704 8714581 I love you too, honey bunny.
8714664 8719920 Now, I want you to go<br />in that bag and find my wallet.
8722422 8725967 - Which one is it?<br />- It's the one that says bad motherfucker.
8740649 8744027 That's it. That's my bad motherfucker.
8744110 8746404 Open it up. Take out the money.
8751952 8753620 Count it.
8759918 8762462 How much is there?
8764339 8766258 About 1,500 dollars.
8766341 8769511 Okay, put it in your pocket. It's yours.
8769594 8772806 Now, with the rest of those wallets<br />and the register...
8772889 8774975 that makes this a pretty successful<br />little score, huh?
8775058 8777185 Jules, you give that<br />fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars...
8777269 8778937 and I'll shoot him<br />on general principle.
8779020 8781940 No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna<br />do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!
8782023 8784609 Vince, shut the fuck up!
8784693 8788571 - Shut up!<br />- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.
8788655 8791574 Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent.
8791658 8793535 I'm bu yin' something for my money.
8794828 8797998 - Wanna know what I'm bu yin', Ringo?<br />- What?
8798081 8802794 Your life. I'm givin' you that money<br />so I don't have to kill your ass.
8802877 8805547 You read the Bible, Ringo?
8806673 8808591 Not regularly, no.
8808675 8811052 Well, there's this passage<br />I got memorized.
8811136 8814681 Ezekiel 25:17.
8814764 8818018 “The path of the righteous man<br />is beset on all sides...
8818101 8821563 by the inequities of the selfish<br />and the tyranny of evil men.
8821646 8825025 Blessed is he who, in the name of charity<br />and good will...
8825108 8827527 shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness...
8827610 8831698 for he is truly his brother's keeper<br />and the finder of lost children.
8831781 8836077 And I will strike down upon thee with<br />great vengeance and furious anger...
8836161 8839205 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy my brothers.
8839289 8842292 And you will know I am the Lord...
8842375 8845045 when I lay my vengeance upon you.”
8847047 8849466 I been ea yin' that shit for years...
8849549 8852677 and if you heard it, that meant your ass.
8852761 8855680 I never gave much thought<br />to what it meant.
8855764 8858683 I just thought it was some coldblooded<br />shit to say to a motherfucker...
8858767 8861186 before I popped a cap in his ass.
8861269 8863688 But I saw some shit this morning<br />made me think twice.
8864773 8867692 See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means...
8867776 8872655 you're the evil man,<br />and I'm the righteous man...
8872739 8875658 and Mr. 9-millimeter here,<br />he's the shepherd...
8875742 8879287 protecting my righteous ass<br />in the Valley of Darkness.
8879371 8881289 Or it could mean...
8881373 8884793 you're the righteous man,<br />and I'm the shepherd...
8884876 8888797 and it's the world<br />that's evil and selfish.
8888880 8891132 Yeah, I'd like that.
8891216 8894094 But that shit ain't the truth.
8894177 8896054 The truth is...
8897097 8899766 you're the weak...
8900433 8903812 and I'm the tyranny of evil men.
8905271 8907190 But I'm tryin', Ringo.
8908441 8913113 I'm tryin' real hard<br />to be the shepherd.
8929045 8930964 Go.
8949149 8951109 I think we should be leaving now.
8951860 8953611 Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
