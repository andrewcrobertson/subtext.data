28072 32201 Forget it. It's too risky.<br />I'm through doing that shit.
32284 34745 You always say that.<br />The same thing every time.
34828 37748 “I'm through, never again, too dangerous.”
37831 40084 I know that's what I always say.<br />I'm always right too.
40167 43796 - You forget about it in a day or two.<br />- The days of me forgetting are over.
43879 45673 The days of me remembering<br />have just begun.
45756 48175 You know, when you go on like this,<br />what you sound like?
48259 51136 - I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.<br />- You sound like a duck.
51220 52680 Quack, quack, quack.
52763 54848 Take heart, 'cause you're never<br />gonna have to hear it again.
54932 58394 Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're<br />never gonna have to hear me quack.
58477 61730 - After tonight?<br />- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
62773 66110 - Can I get anyone more coffee?<br />- Oh, yes!
67945 70489 - Thank you.<br />- You're welcome.
71824 75536 I mean, the way it is now, you're takin'<br />the same risk as when you rob a bank.
76370 78664 Takin' more of a risk. Banks are easier.
78747 81542 Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you<br />in any way during a robbery.
81625 86046 They're insured. Why should they give a fuck?<br />I don't even need a gun in a federal bank.
86130 89425 Heard about this one bloke, he walks<br />into a bank with a portable phone.
89508 92553 He gives the phone to a teller.<br />The bloke on the other end says...
92636 96265 “We got this guy's little girl. If you don't give<br />him all your money, we're gonna kill her.”
96348 98142 - Did it work?<br />- Fuckin' right it worked.
98225 101895 That's what I'm talkin' about. Knucklehead<br />walks into a bank with a telephone...
101979 105065 not a pistol, not a shotgun,<br />a fuckin' phone.
105149 107526 Cleans the place out.<br />They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
107610 109737 Did they hurt the little girl?
109820 113532 There probably never was a little girl.<br />The point of the story isn't a little girl.
113616 116577 The point of the story is they<br />robbed a bank with a telephone.
116660 119622 - You want to rob banks?<br />- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.
119705 122124 I'm illustrating if we did,<br />it'd be easier than what we've been doing.
122207 123542 No more liquor stores?
123626 126378 What've we been talkin' about?<br />Yeah, no more liquor stores.
126462 129423 Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.<br />There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.
129506 131759 Vietnamese, Koreans,<br />don't even speak fuckin' English.
131842 134178 You tell 'em empty out the register,<br />they don't know what you're talkin' about.
134261 135763 They make it too personal.
135846 137765 We keep on, one of these gook<br />fuckers gonna make us kill him.
137848 141477 - I'm not gonna kill anybody.<br />- I don't want to kill anybody either.
141560 144521 But they'll probably put us in<br />a situation where it's us or them.
144605 146148 And if it's not the gooks...
146231 149234 it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned<br />the store for 15 fucking generations.
149318 153739 You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the<br />counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.
153822 155741 Try walkin' into one of those places<br />with nothing but a phone.
155824 157743 See how far that gets you. Forget it.
157826 160746 - We're out of it.<br />- Well, what then, day jobs?
160829 162873 - Not in this life.<br />- What then?
165042 167211 <i>Garcon,</i> coffee!
167294 168962 This place.
171048 172925 <i>Garcon</i> means boy.
177388 180057 This place? <i>A</i> coffee shop?
180140 181725 What's wrong with that?
183185 186855 Nobody ever robs restaurants. Why not?
187815 190234 Bars, liquor stores...
190317 194029 gas stations; you get your head blown off<br />stickin' up one of them.
194113 197533 Restaurants, on the other hand,<br />you catch with their pants down.
197616 200994 They're not expectin' to get robbed.<br />Not as expectin' anyway.
201078 205040 I bet you could cut down<br />on the hero factor in a place like this.
205124 206125 Correct.
206208 209461 Same as banks, these places are insured.
209545 211880 Manager. He don't give a fuck.
211964 214800 They're just trying to get you out<br />before you start pluggin' the diners.
214883 218846 Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way<br />they're takin' a bullet for the register.
218929 221849 Busboys. Some wetback gettin'<br />paid $1.50 an hour...
221932 224435 really give a fuck you're<br />stealin' from the owner?
224518 227604 Customers sittin' there with food in their<br />mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.
227688 229314 One minute,<br />they're havin' a Denver omelet...
229398 232359 the next, someone<br />is stickin' a gun in their face.
232443 237489 See, I got the idea the last liquor store<br />we stuck up, remember?
237573 240242 - All the customers kept comin' in.<br />- Yeah.
240325 244163 You got the idea of takin' their wallets.<br />Now, that was a good idea.
244246 245456 Thank you.
245539 247624 Made more from the wallets<br />than we did from the register.
247708 250002 - Yes, we did.<br />- A lot of people come to restaurants.
250085 251670 A lot of wallets.
251754 253756 Pretty smart, huh?
254590 255841 Pretty smart.
258051 260387 I'm ready. Let's do it.<br />Right now, right here.
260471 264975 - Come on.<br />- All right. Same as last time, remember?
265058 267811 You're crowd control.<br />I'll handle the employees.
273484 276236 - I love you, pumpkin.<br />- I love you, honey bunny.
277446 279907 Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!
279990 282868 Any of you fucking pricks move...
282951 286747 and I'll execute every motherfuckin'<br />last one of you.
398358 400569 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Get down with the boogie</i>
400652 402821 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Get it on</i>
402905 405073 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Get down with the boogie</i>
405157 407367 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Get it on</i>
407451 409703 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Get up with the boogie</i>
409786 411872 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Get up with the get down</i>
411955 414207 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Get down and boogie</i>
414291 416793 - <i>Jungle boogie</i><br />- <i>Shake it around</i>
424259 428347 - Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars.<br />- Okay, what you want to know?
428430 431224 - Hash is legal there, right?<br />- Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.
431308 435938 You just can't walk into a restaurant,<br />roll a joint and start puffin' away.
436021 439358 I mean, they want you to smoke in<br />your home or certain designated places.
439441 442069 - Those are hash bars?<br />- Yeah. It breaks down like this.
442152 444488 It's legal to buy it.<br />It's legal to own it.
444571 447741 And if you're the proprietor<br />of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
447824 452245 It's illegal to carry it, but that<br />doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.
452329 456750 If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,<br />it's illegal for them to search you.
456833 459169 I mean, that's a right the cops<br />in Amsterdam don't have.
459252 462881 Oh, man! I'm goin'.<br />That's all there is to it. I'm fuckin' goin'.
462965 465050 I know, baby. You'd dig it the most.
466468 468470 But you know what the funniest thing<br />about Europe is?
468553 470847 - What?<br />- It's the little differences.
470931 473183 I mean, they got the same shit<br />over there that they got here...
473266 476269 - but it's just there, it's a little different.<br />- Example.
476353 480023 You can walk into a movie theater<br />in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
480107 483735 And I don't mean just like no paper cup.<br />I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.
483819 486697 And in Paris, you can buy a beer<br />in McDonald's.
486780 491201 You know what they call<br />a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
491284 493453 They don't call it<br />a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?
493537 496331 They got the metric system. They wouldn't<br />know what the fuck a quarter-pounder is.
496415 500293 - What do they call it?<br />- They call it a Royale with Cheese.
500377 502295 - Royale with Cheese.<br />- That's right.
502379 503839 What do they call a Big Mac?
503922 507217 Big Mac's a Big Mac,<br />but they call it Le Big Mac.
507300 508885 Le Big Mac.
510512 512014 What do they call a Whopper?
512097 514516 I don't know. I didn't go<br />into Burger King.
514599 517227 You know what they put on french fries<br />in Holland instead of ketchup?
517310 518311 What?
518395 521231 - Mayonnaise.<br />- Goddamn!
521314 523942 I seen 'em do it, man.<br />They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.
524026 525610 Yuck.
528280 531199 We should have shotguns<br />for this kind of deal.
534578 537330 - How many up there?<br />- Three or four.
537414 541001 - That's countin' our guy?<br />- Not sure.
541084 543670 So that means that it could be<br />up to five guys up there?
543754 546923 - It's possible.<br />- We should have fuckin' shotguns.
548008 549634 - What's her name?<br />- Mia.
549718 553889 - Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?<br />- I don't know.
553972 557559 However people meet people.<br />She used to be a actress.
557642 560145 Oh, really?<br />She do anything I'd have seen?
560228 562898 I think her biggest deal<br />was she starred in a pilot.
562981 564649 Pilot? What's a pilot?
564733 568236 - Well, you know the shows on TV?<br />- I don't watch TV.
568320 571698 Yeah, but you are aware that there<br />is an invention called television...
571782 574034 and on this invention<br />they show shows, right?
574117 575118 Yeah.
575202 579581 The way they pick TV shows is they make<br />one show. That show's called a pilot.
579664 582292 Then they show that one show<br />to the people who pick shows...
582375 585587 and on the strength of that one show, they<br />decide if they wanna make more shows.
585670 590300 Some get chosen and become television<br />programs. Some don't, become nothin'.
590967 593470 She starred in one of the ones<br />that became nothing.
594471 596306 You remember Antwan Rockamora?
596389 600227 Half-black, half-Samoan.<br />Used to call him “Tony Rocky Horror.”
600310 601770 Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?
601853 603688 I wouldn't go so far as to<br />call the brother fat.
603772 606566 He got a weight problem. I mean, what's<br />a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.
606650 608693 I think I know who you mean.<br />What about him?
608777 611071 Marsellus fucked him up good.
611154 615408 Word 'round the campfire is it was on<br />account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
623542 627587 - So what he'd do? Fuck her?<br />- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.
627671 631174 - Well, then what then?<br />- He gave her a foot massage.
633593 636721 A foot massage?<br />That's it?
638056 639975 Then what'd Marsellus do?
640058 643228 Sent a couple cats over to his place.<br />They took him out on his patio.
643311 647232 Threw his ass over the balcony.<br />Nigger fell four stories.
647315 651361 He had a little garden down at the bottom<br />enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.
651444 653697 Nigger fell through that.
653780 656700 Since then, he kind of developed<br />a speech impediment.
658034 659786 That's a damn shame.
665625 668670 But still, you play with matches,<br />you get burned.
668753 670255 What do you mean?
670338 673633 You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's<br />new bride a foot massage.
673717 676178 You don't think he overreacted?
676261 681141 Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the<br />way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.
681224 685353 It was a foot massage. A foot massage is<br />nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.
685437 688982 It's laying your hands in a familiar way<br />on Marsellus's new wife.
689065 693945 I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out?<br />No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.
694029 695530 Stop right there.
695614 698783 Eatin' the bitch out and givin' the bitch a foot<br />massage ain't even the same fucking thing.
698867 702787 - It's not. It's the same ballpark.<br />- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.
702871 705790 Now, look, maybe your method<br />of massage differs from mine.
705874 709628 But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking<br />your tongue in the holiest of holies...
709711 713965 ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the<br />same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.
714049 717928 - Foot massages don't mean shit!<br />- Have you ever given a foot massage?
719095 722515 Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.<br />I'm the foot fuckin' master.
722599 724100 You given a lot of them?
724184 728104 Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and<br />everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.
728188 730565 Would you give a guy a foot massage?
732400 733860 Fuck you.
735028 738114 - You give 'em a lot?<br />- Fuck you.
738198 740909 You know, I'm kind of tired.<br />I could use a foot massage.
740992 743870 Yo, yo, yo, man. You best back off.<br />I'm gettin' a little pissed here.
745789 747874 - This is the door.<br />- Yeah, it is.
751127 752671 What time you got?
753838 755966 7:22 in the am.
756049 759636 No, it ain't quite time yet.<br />Come on. Let's hang back.
767644 770939 Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no<br />man a foot massage don't make it right...
771022 774234 for Marsellus to throw Antwan off<br />a building into a glass motherfuckin' house...
774317 777028 fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;<br />that shit ain't right.
777112 781324 Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better<br />paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.
781408 786371 I ain't ea yin' it's right, but you ea yin' a foot<br />massage don't mean nothin'. I'm ea yin' it does.
786454 791084 Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million<br />foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.
791167 794879 We act like they don't, but they do.<br />That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.
794963 797048 There's a sensuous thing goin' on...
797132 800343 where you don't talk about it,<br />but you know it and she knows it.
800427 805473 Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan<br />should've fuckin' better known better.
805557 809936 That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a man<br />with a sense of humor about this shit.
810020 811646 You know what I'm ea yin'?
812897 814816 It's an interestin' point.
814899 816860 Come on. Let's get into character.
823783 825785 - What's her name again?<br />- Mia.
825869 828872 - Mia.<br />- Why you so interested in big man's wife?
828955 834169 He's goin' out of town, Florida. And he asked<br />me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.
834252 838214 - Take care of her?<br />- No, man. Just take her out.
838298 841634 Show her a good time.<br />Make sure she don't get lonely.
841718 844262 You're gonna be takin'<br />Mia Wallace out on a date?
844346 846973 It is not a date.
847057 851144 It's just like if you were gonna take<br />your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.
851227 853438 It's just good company, that's all.
858735 862447 It's not a date.<br />It's definitely not a date.
869913 873750 Hey, kids. How you boys doin'?
873833 875502 Hey, keep chillin'.
882967 884469 You know who we are?
886054 889516 We're associates of your business partner,<br />Marsellus Wallace.
889599 892602 You do remember<br />your business partner, don't you?
894771 897065 Now, let me take a wild guess here.
900693 903321 - You're Brett, right?<br />- Yeah.
903405 905156 I thought so.
905240 908868 You remember your business partner<br />Marsellus Wallace, don't ya, Brett?
909911 911371 Yeah, I remember.
911454 915750 Good. Looks like me and Vincent<br />caught you boys at breakfast.
915834 918461 Sorry about that. Whatcha havin'?
919295 920505 Hamburgers.
920588 924676 Hamburgers! The cornerstone<br />of any nutritious breakfast.
925510 927095 What kind of hamburgers?
928430 930140 - Cheeseburgers.<br />- No, no, no.
930223 933309 Where'd you get 'em?<br />McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack in the Box?
933393 936187 - Where?<br />- Big Kahuna Burger.
936271 939399 Big Kahuna Burger!<br />That's that Hawaiian burger joint.
939482 943445 I hear they got some tasty burgers.<br />I ain't never had one myself. How are they?
944571 947657 - They're good.<br />- You mind if I try one of yours?
948950 951369 - This is yours here, right?<br />- Yeah.
961546 964674 This is a tasty burger! Vincent!
964757 967302 You ever had a Big Kahuna burger?
968303 971806 - Want a bite? They're real tasty.<br />- I ain't hungry.
971890 974309 Well, if you like burgers,<br />give 'em a try sometime.
974392 978229 Me, I can't usually get 'em<br />'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian...
978313 981441 which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.
981524 984068 But I do love the taste<br />of a good burger.
985904 988740 You know what they call<br />a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?
989866 991409 - No.<br />- Tell 'em, Vincent.
991493 995497 - A Royale with Cheese.<br />- A Royale with Cheese.
995580 997540 You know why they call it that?
1000251 1002212 Because of the metric system?
1003254 1006549 Check out the big brain on Brett!
1006633 1010011 You're a smart motherfucker.<br />That's right. The metric system.
1012305 1014432 - What's in this?<br />- Sprite.
1014516 1015850 Sprite. Good.
1015934 1020396 You mind if I have some of your tasty<br />beverage to wash this down with?
1021147 1022649 Go right ahead.
1034577 1036246 That hit the spot.
1037664 1040750 You. Flock of Seagulls.<br />You know why we're here?

1052720 1054514 You were ea yin'?

1088590 1091301 - We happy?<br />- Yeah, we happy.
1093344 1097640 Look, I'm sorry.<br />I didn't get your name.
1097724 1100893 I got yours. Vincent. Right?<br />But I never got yours.
1100977 1104689 My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't<br />talkin' your way outta this shit.
1104772 1106316 No, no, no.
1107817 1110236 I just want you to know how—
1113364 1116868 I just want you to know how sorry we are<br />that things got so fucked up...
1116951 1119120 with us and Mr. Wallace.
1119203 1123708 We got into this thing<br />with the best intentions. Really. I never—
1124334 1127170 Oh, I'm sorry, did I break<br />your concentration?
1127837 1129839 I didn't mean to do that. Please.
1129922 1135136 Continue. You were saying something<br />about “best intentions.”
1136512 1140391 What's the matter? Oh, you were finished!
1140475 1143186 Oh, well, allow me to retort.
1146731 1149734 What does Marsellus Wallace look like?
1150818 1152028 What?
1152945 1155323 - What country you from?<br />- What?
1155406 1158201 “What” ain't no country I ever heard of.<br />They speak English in What?
1158284 1159661 What?
1159744 1162455 - English, Motherfucker! Do you speak it?<br />- Yes!
1162538 1164207 - Then you know what I'm ea yin'!<br />- Yes.
1164290 1167710 Describe what<br />Marsellus Wallace looks like!
1168920 1170421 - What? I—<br />- Say “what” again!
1170505 1174425 Say “what” again! I dare ya!<br />I double dare you, motherfucker!
1174509 1178388 - Say “what” one more goddamn time!<br />- He's black.
1178471 1180807 - Go on!<br />- He's bald!
1180890 1183601 - Does he look like a bitch?<br />- What?
1185353 1189357 Does he look... like a bitch?
1189440 1190441 No!
1190525 1192652 Then why you tr yin'<br />to fuck him like a bitch, Brett?
1192735 1196364 - I didn't.<br />- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!
1196447 1198616 - You tried to fuck him.<br />- No, no.
1198700 1203955 But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be<br />fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
1204038 1207083 - You read the Bible, Brett?<br />- Yes!
1207166 1211713 Well, there's this passage I got memorized.<br />Sort of fits this occasion.
1211796 1214132 Ezekiel 25:17.
1215091 1217510 “The path of the righteous man...
1217593 1221514 is beset on all sides<br />by the inequities of the selfish...
1221597 1224517 and the tyranny of evil men.
1224600 1229522 Blessed is he who,<br />in the name of charity and goodwill...
1229605 1232734 shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness...
1232817 1235486 for he is truly his brother's keeper...
1235570 1239115 and the finder of lost children.
1239198 1245037 And I will strike down upon thee<br />with great vengeance and furious anger...
1245121 1249751 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy my brothers!
1249834 1253671 And you will know my name is the Lord...
1253755 1257133 when I lay my vengeance upon thee!”
1275359 1280072 I think you gonna find,<br />when all this shit is over and done—
1282450 1285953 I think you're gonna find yourself<br />one smilin' motherfucker.
1288372 1289874 The thing is, Butch...
1291250 1294295 right now... you got ability.
1295963 1301344 But painful as it may be,<br />ability... don't last.
1303596 1305932 And your days are just about over.
1307767 1310853 Now, that's a hard<br />motherfuckin' fact of life.
1312230 1315983 But that's a fact of life your ass is<br />gonna have to get realistic about.
1319195 1323366 You see, this business is filled to the brim<br />with unrealistic motherfuckers.
1324700 1328704 Motherfuckers who thought<br />their ass would age like wine.
1330373 1334126 If you mean it turns<br />to vinegar... it does.
1335378 1339173 If you mean it gets better<br />with age... it don't.
1341300 1342802 Besides, Butch...
1345012 1347640 how many fights you think<br />you got in you anyway?
1350977 1352270 Two?
1354063 1356774 Boxers don't have an old-timers' day.
1358568 1361571 You came close, but you never made it.
1362613 1366325 And if you were gonna make it,<br />you would have made it before now.
1383551 1385303 You my nigger?
1390474 1392518 Certainly appears so.
1399317 1403195 The night of the fight,<br />you may feel a slight sting.
1406407 1409285 That's pride fuckin' with you.
1410828 1412955 Fuck pride!
1415166 1416959 Pride only hurts.
1418294 1420212 It never helps.
1421631 1423674 You fight through that shit.
1425176 1430056 'Cause a year from now,<br />when you kickin' it in the Caribbean...
1430139 1434644 you gonna say to yourself,<br />“Marsellus Wallace was right.”
1436938 1439148 I got no problem with that, Mr. Wallace.
1441484 1445279 In the fifth, your ass goes down.
1449325 1450701 Say it.
1453537 1455790 In the fifth, my ass goes down.
1458918 1461420 Yo, Vincent Vega. Our man in Amsterdam.
1461504 1465967 Jules Winfield, our man in Inglewood.<br />Get your asses on in here.

1468386 1469887 You don't even want to know.
1471430 1473224 Where's the big man?
1473307 1476060 The big man's right over<br />there takin' care of some business.
1476143 1480773 Why don't you hang back a second or two.<br />You see the white boy leave, just go on over.
1483693 1485736 How ya been?
1485820 1487905 I been doin' pretty good.<br />How 'bout yourself?
1487989 1489740 All right.
1492034 1494203 So I hear you're takin' Mia out tomorrow.
1497373 1499083 At Marsellus's request.
1501460 1503379 - Have you met Mia?<br />- Not yet.
1504964 1506632 What's so fuckin' funny?
1506716 1509301 - Not a goddamn thing.<br />- I got to piss.
1509385 1513639 Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot, all right?<br />It's the big man's wife.
1513723 1516392 I'm gonna sit across from her,<br />chew my food with my mouth closed...
1516475 1518436 laugh at her fuckin' jokes, and that's it.
1518519 1521647 Hey, my name's Paul,<br />and this shit's between y'all.
1521731 1525526 Then what'd you fuckin'<br />ask me about it for? Asshole.
1533576 1535786 - Gimme a pack of Red Apples.<br />- Filters?
1535870 1537288 No.
1540624 1544045 - You lookin' at somethin', friend?<br />- You ain't my friend, palooka.
1546630 1550134 - What was that?<br />- I think you heard me just fine, punchy.
1550217 1552803 Vincent Vega's in the house?
1552887 1555848 My nigger, get your ass over here.
1563773 1566525 - What's up?<br />- Man, I'm really sorry.
1566609 1568778 You shouldn't worry about it.
1568861 1571822 Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.
1574325 1575868 And some matches.
1579789 1581207 Thanks.
1583584 1587880 It's as if it turns every part of<br />your body into the tip of a penis.
1587963 1591258 I'll lend it to you.<br />It's a great book on piercing.
1591342 1596347 That gun to pierce your ears, they don't<br />use that to pierce your nipples, do they?
1596430 1600267 Forget that gun. That guns goes against<br />the entire idea behind piercing.
1600351 1605231 All my piercing, 18 places on my body,<br />every one of 'em done with a needle.
1605314 1608776 Five in each ear, one through the nipple<br />of my left breast...
1608859 1611987 two in my right nostril,<br />one in my left eyebrow...
1612071 1614907 one in my belly, one in my lip,<br />one in my clit...
1614990 1618452 - and I wear a stud in my tongue.<br />- Excuse me.
1618536 1620454 I was just curious...
1620538 1624416 but... why would you wear<br />a stud in your tongue?
1624500 1627962 Sex thing. Helps fellatio.
1628045 1631549 Vincenzo. Step in my office.
1638806 1641851 This is Panda from Mexico.<br />Very good stuff.
1641934 1645354 Now, that's Bava.<br />Different, but equally good.
1645437 1648357 And that is Choco<br />from the Harz Mountains of Germany.
1648440 1652862 Now, the first two are the same.<br />300 a gram. Those are friend prices.
1652945 1655906 But this one is a little more expensive.
1655990 1658367 This is 500 a gram.
1658450 1661829 But, when you shoot it,<br />you will know where that extra money went.
1661912 1666000 There's nothing wrong with these two.<br />This is real, real, real good shit.
1666083 1668669 But this one is a fuckin' madman.
1669837 1672590 Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.
1672673 1675676 Am I a nigger? Are we in Inglewood? No.
1675759 1678929 You're in my home. Now, white people<br />who know the difference...
1679013 1681974 between good shit and bad shit,<br />this is the house they come to.
1682057 1685436 Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi<br />Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...
1685519 1688814 - any old day of the fuckin' week.<br />- That's a bold statement.
1688898 1692735 This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.<br />This is a seller's market.
1692818 1696822 Coke is fuckin' dead as... dead.
1696906 1699742 Heroin, it's comin' back<br />in a big fuckin' way.
1702036 1705497 - All right. Gimme three grams of madman.<br />- Okay.
1705581 1709001 Now, if it's as good as you say it is,<br />I'll come back and buy another thousand.
1709084 1711837 I just hope that I still<br />have some left for ya...
1711921 1716091 but I'm givin' you<br />some out of my own private stash.
1716175 1718093 That is what a nice guy I am.
1719428 1723515 - I'm outta balloons. Is a baggie all right?<br />- Yeah, that's cool.
1723599 1725559 All right. I'll just get one for ya.
1725643 1730564 Honey, will you get me some baggies<br />and twistix from the kitchen?
1730648 1732233 Okay.
1732316 1735694 Hey, what do you think about Trudi?<br />She ain't got a boyfriend.
1735778 1739573 - You wanna hang out and get high?<br />- Which one's Trudi?
1739657 1743827 - The one with all the shit in her face?<br />- No, that's Jody.
1743911 1745788 That's my wife.
1748123 1751001 - I'm sorry, man.<br />- Thank you.
1751085 1754672 - No, I can't. I gotta be some place.<br />- All right, no <i>problemo.</i>
1754755 1756507 I'll take a rain check.
1759385 1761136 Thank you, Jody.
1761762 1763389 Still got your Malibu?
1764598 1767685 Oh, man, you know what some fucker<br />did the other day?
1767768 1769687 - What?<br />- Fuckin' keyed it.
1769770 1773357 - Oh, man, that's fucked up.<br />- Tell me about it.
1773440 1776110 I had it in storage for three years.
1776193 1780531 It was out five days, and some dickless<br />piece of shit fucked with it.
1780614 1785035 They should be fuckin' killed, man.<br />No trial, no jury, straight to execution.
1785119 1789832 I wish I could've caught him doin' it. I'd<br />have given anything to catch that asshole.
1789915 1792918 It'd been worth him doin' it<br />just so I could've caught him.
1793002 1794628 What a fucker!
1794712 1797506 What's more chicken-shit than<br />fuckin' with a man's automobile?
1797589 1800467 - Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.<br />- You don't do it.
1800551 1802928 - It's just against the rules.<br />- Thank you.
1803012 1804513 Thank you.
1805264 1808058 - Mind if I shoot up here?<br />- Hey, mi <i>casa es su casa.</i>
1914373 1918460 <i>Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed.<br />The door's open.</i>

2213505 2217843 Let's see, steak, steak, steak. Oh, yeah,<br />I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.
2217926 2219428 I'll have that.
2219511 2222180 How do you want that cooked?<br />Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell?
2222264 2225434 Bloody as hell, and—<br />Oh, yeah, look at this— vanilla coke.
2227436 2228937 What about you, Peggy Sue?
2229980 2235819 I'll have the...<br />Durward Kirby burger, bloody.
2236778 2240699 And... a five-dollar shake.
2240782 2243493 How do you want that shake,<br />Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?
2243577 2247748 - Martin and Lewis.<br />- Did you just order a five-dollar shake?
2249916 2254004 - That's a shake? That's milk and ice cream?<br />- Last I heard.
2254087 2257549 That's five dollars? You don't<br />put bourbon in it or nothin'?
2257632 2259968 - No.<br />- Just checking.
2260051 2261720 I'll be right back with your drinks.
2261803 2264014 <i>To lonesome town</i>
2264097 2268810 <i>To cry my troubles away</i>
2270395 2274483 Could you...<br />roll me one of those, cowboy?
2275525 2277402 You can have this one, cowgirl.
2277486 2278528 Thanks.
2278612 2281865 <i>The streets are filled with regret</i>
2284159 2285619 Think nothin' of it.
2285702 2290081 <i>Lay me down<br />in lonesome town</i>
2290165 2293668 - <i>I can learn to forget</i><br />- So...
2293752 2296838 Marsellus said you just<br />got back from Amsterdam.
2296922 2300050 - Sure did.<br />- How long were you there?
2300842 2302677 Just over three years.
2305180 2308016 I go there about once a year<br />to chill out for a month.
2308642 2311311 No kiddin'? I didn't know that.
2312938 2314856 Why would you?
2319361 2321029 I heard you did a pilot.
2322697 2324783 That was my 15 minutes.
2324866 2326409 What was it?
2326493 2331164 It was a show about a team of female<br />secret agents called Fox Force <i>Five.</i>
2331248 2333959 - What?<br />- <i>Fox Force Five.</i>
2334042 2336294 Fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks.
2336378 2338839 Force, as in we're a force<br />to be reckoned with.
2338922 2341675 And five, as in there's<br />one-two-three-four-five of us.
2341758 2345470 There was a blond one,<br />Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.
2345554 2348640 The Japanese fox was a kung fu master.
2348723 2352811 The black girl was a demolition expert.
2352894 2355730 French Fox's specialty was sex.
2355814 2357399 What was your specialty?
2358066 2359568 Knives.
2360193 2362279 The character I played, Raven McCoy...
2362362 2366199 her background was she grew up raised<br />by circus performers.
2366283 2370537 According to the show, she was the<br />deadliest woman in the world with a knife.
2370620 2373373 And she knew a zillion old jokes.
2373456 2377586 Her grandfather,<br />an old vaudevillian, taught her.
2377669 2380964 And if we would have got picked up,<br />they would've worked in a gimmick...
2381047 2384926 where every show<br />I would've told another joke.
2387095 2388889 You know any of them old jokes?
2388972 2392684 Well, I only got the chance to say one<br />'cause we only did one show.
2392767 2395312 - Tell me.<br />- It's corny.
2396229 2398315 Don't be that way. Tell me.
2398398 2400942 No, you wouldn't like it,<br />and I'd be embarrassed.
2401026 2406072 You'd be embarr— You told 50 million<br />people, and you can't tell me?
2406156 2410035 - I promise I won't laugh.<br />- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.
2410118 2412412 That's not what I meant. You know it.
2412495 2415916 Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you<br />'cause it's been built up too much.
2415999 2417709 What a gyp.
2420295 2422130 Martin and Lewis.
2425216 2426593 Vanilla coke.
2434017 2435268 Yummy.
2435352 2437312 You think I could have a sip of that?
2440357 2442025 Be my guest.
2442108 2444736 I gotta know what<br />a five-dollar shake tastes like.
2446196 2448239 You can use my straw.<br />I don't have cooties.
2448323 2451117 - Yeah, but maybe I do.<br />- Cooties I can handle.
2452661 2454162 All right.
2461711 2464506 Goddamn, that's a pretty<br />fuckin' good milk shake!
2464589 2465590 Told ya.
2465674 2468677 I don't know if it was worth five dollars,<br />but it's pretty fuckin' good.
2503586 2505380 Don't you hate that?
2505463 2507132 Hate what?
2507215 2509551 Uncomfortable silences.
2510927 2516057 Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about<br />bullshit in order to be comfortable?
2516891 2519352 I don't know. That's a good question.
2521146 2523898 That's when you know<br />you found somebody really special.
2524941 2529654 When you can just shut the fuck up<br />for a minute and comfortably share silence.
2529738 2533408 Well, I don't think we're quite there yet,<br />but don't feel bad. We just met each other.
2535326 2536953 I'll tell you what.
2538538 2541791 I'm gonna go to the bathroom<br />and powder my nose.
2541875 2545086 You sit here...<br />and think of something to say.
2546087 2547714 I'll do that.
2551217 2552552 Okay.
2577786 2579954 I said goddamn!
2580038 2583208 Goddamn! Goddamn.
2585418 2587420 I need some hair spray.
2596304 2598556 Don't you just love it when you<br />come back from the bathroom...
2598640 2600642 to find your food waiting for you?
2600725 2602936 We're lucky we got anything at all.
2603019 2605396 I don't think Buddy Holly's<br />much of a waiter.
2606397 2608525 Maybe we should've sat<br />in Marilyn Monroe's section.
2608608 2611653 - Which one? There's two Monroes.<br />- No, there's not.
2612403 2613696 That is Marilyn Monroe.
2616032 2617867 That is Mamie Van Doren.
2618952 2622872 I don't see Jayne Mansfield,<br />so she must have the night off.
2622956 2626376 - Pretty smart.<br />- Yeah. I got my moments.
2626459 2628253 So did you think of somethin' to say?
2628336 2630338 Actually, I did.
2632465 2633925 However...
2636970 2639139 you seem like a really nice person, and I—
2639222 2640723 I don't want to offend you.
2642142 2647313 This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless,<br />boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.
2647397 2649816 This sounds like you<br />actually have somethin' to say.
2649899 2652360 Well, well, I do. I do.
2653862 2657448 - But you have to promise not to be offended.<br />- No, no.
2657532 2661619 You can't promise somethin' like that.<br />I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.
2661703 2663580 You can ask me what you're gonna ask me...
2663663 2666124 and my natural response could be<br />to get offended.
2666207 2669127 Then through no fault of my own,<br />I would have broken my promise.
2669210 2671880 - Let's just forget it.<br />- That's an impossibility.
2671963 2676009 Trying to forget anything as intriguing<br />as this would be an exercise in futility.
2676092 2678303 - Is that a fact?<br />- And besides...
2678386 2681806 isn't it more exciting<br />when you don't have permission?
2681890 2683391 All right, all right.
2683474 2685393 Well, here goes.
2686352 2689355 What did you think about<br />what happened to Antwan?
2689439 2692859 - Who's Antwan?<br />- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.
2692942 2694444 He fell out of a window.
2696237 2698114 Well, that is one way to say it.
2698198 2700950 Another way to say it would be<br />that he was thrown out.
2701034 2704162 Another way would be<br />he was thrown out by Marsellus.
2704245 2705830 Yet, even another way...
2705914 2709375 is to say he was thrown out of<br />a window by Marsellus because of you.
2709459 2711878 - Is that a fact?<br />- No.
2711961 2715089 No, it's not a fact. It's just what I heard.<br />That's just what I heard.
2715715 2717675 - Who told you?<br />- They.
2719093 2720595 “They” talk a lot, don't they?
2722764 2725433 They certainly do. They certainly do.
2725516 2727518 Don't be shy, Vincent.<br />What else did “they” say?
2727602 2729270 I'm not shy.
2730605 2732523 Did it involve the “F” word?
2732607 2736611 No, no, no, no, no. They just said that<br />Antwan had given you a foot massage.
2738112 2741366 - And?<br />- And nothin'. That's it.
2743785 2748039 You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror<br />out of a fourth-story window...
2748122 2750708 for giving me a foot massage?
2750792 2752293 And you believe that?
2753795 2756881 Well, at the time I was told<br />it sounded reasonable.
2756965 2760051 Marsellus throwing Tony out<br />of a fourth-story window...
2760134 2762512 for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?
2762595 2765932 No, it seemed excessive,<br />but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.
2766015 2769477 I understand that Marsellus<br />is very protective of you.
2770270 2774148 A husband being protective<br />of his wife is one thing.
2774232 2777986 A husband almost killing another man for<br />touching his wife's feet is something else.
2778569 2780071 But did it happen?
2780154 2785576 Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was<br />my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.
2786619 2787996 Really?
2788079 2791582 Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw<br />Tony out that window...
2791666 2793543 except Marsellus and Tony.
2794502 2797839 When you little scamps get together,<br />you're worse than a sewing circle.
2797922 2802468 Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment<br />you've all been waiting for.
2802552 2807181 The world-famous<br />Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.
2811019 2814314 Now, this is where one lucky couple...
2814397 2818860 will win this handsome trophy<br />that Marilyn here is holding.
2818943 2822488 Now, who will be our first contestants?
2822572 2824866 - Right here!<br />- All right!
2824949 2827952 - I wanna dance.<br />- No, no, no, no, no.
2828036 2832749 No, no, no, no, no. I do believe<br />Marsellus, my husband, your boss...
2832832 2835752 told you to take me out<br />and do whatever I wanted.
2835835 2840006 Now I wanna dance;<br />I wanna win; I want that trophy.
2840089 2842675 - So dance good.<br />- All right. You asked for it.
2842759 2844594 Let's hear it for our first contestants.
2850350 2852810 Now let's meet our first contestants<br />here this evening.
2852894 2855480 Young lady, what is your name?
2855563 2857648 Mrs. Mia Wallace.
2857732 2860360 And how 'bout your fella here?
2860443 2862153 Vincent Vega.
2862236 2865782 All right, let's see what<br />you can do. Take it away!
2865865 2868117 - Go for it.<br />- Come on!
2887095 2891057 <i>It was a teenage wedding<br />and the old folks wished them well</i>
2893059 2897021 <i>You could see that Pierre<br />did truly love the mademoiselle</i>
2899107 2903194 <i>And now the young monsieur and madame<br />have rung the chapel bell</i>
2905154 2909450 <i>C'est la vie say the old folks<br />It goes to show you never can tell</i>
2911327 2915498 <i>They furnished off an apartment<br />with a two-room Roebucks sale</i>
2917417 2921671 <i>The 'coolerador was crammed<br />with TV dinners and ginger ale</i>
2923548 2927468 <i>But when Pierre found work<br />the little money comin' worked out well</i>
2929554 2933808 <i>C'est la vie say the old folks<br />It goes to show you never can tell</i>
2935518 2939897 <i>They had a hi-fi phono<br />and boy did they let it blast</i>
2941941 2946195 <i>Seven hundred little records<br />all rock, rhythm and jazz</i>
2947947 2952034 <i>But when the sun went down<br />the rapid tempo of the music fell</i>
2953995 2959000 <i>C'est la vie say the old folks<br />It goes to show you never can tell</i>
2984525 2988738 <i>They had a teenage wedding<br />and the old folks wished them well</i>
2990781 2994744 <i>You could see that Pierre<br />did truly love the mademoiselle</i>
3029946 3033157 Is that what you call<br />an uncomfortable silence?
3033241 3035535 I don't know what you call that.
3037662 3039288 Drinks! Music!
3040289 3041832 I'm gonna take a piss.
3042917 3047588 That's a little bit more information than<br />I needed, Vince, but go right ahead.
3060643 3062520 <i>Girl</i>
3062603 3064272 <i>Bomp, bomp, bom</i>
3064355 3068067 <i>You'll be a woman soon</i>
3071237 3073698 <i>I love you so much<br />Can't count all the ways</i>
3073781 3076742 <i>I'd die for you, girl<br />and all they can say is</i>
3076826 3078828 <i>He's not your kind</i>
3080121 3085209 <i>You never get tired of putting me down<br />and I never know when I come around</i>
3085293 3087753 <i>What I'm gonna find</i>
3087837 3090840 <i>Don't let them<br />make up your mind</i>
3092008 3094385 <i>Don't you know, girl</i>
3096262 3099890 <i>You'll be a woman soon</i>
3099974 3102893 One drink, and that's it.
3102977 3106981 Don't be rude.<br />Drink your drink, but do it quickly.
3108524 3110985 Say good night... and go home.
3113404 3117533 <i>You'll be a woman soon</i>
3118743 3120828 <i>Soon</i>
3122038 3125333 <i>You'll need a man</i>
3127084 3128919 <i>I've been misunderstood<br />for all of my life</i>
3129003 3132214 <i>But what they're n', girl<br />it cuts like a knife</i>
3132298 3133799 <i>The boy's no good</i>
3134717 3137428 <i>Well, I've finally have found<br />what I been lookin' for</i>
3137511 3140306 <i>But if they get a chance<br />they'll end it for sure</i>
3140389 3141891 <i>Sure they would</i>
3141974 3144685 <i>Baby, I've done all I could</i>
3146228 3149398 You see, this is a moral test of oneself.
3149482 3152735 Whether or not you can maintain loyalty.
3152818 3156113 Because... being loyal is very important.
3156197 3160785 <i>You never get tired of putting me down<br />and I never know when I come around</i>
3160868 3163454 <i>What I'm gonna find</i>
3163537 3167500 <i>Don't let them<br />make up your mind</i>

3202326 3204245 - Hello.<br />- <i>Girl</i>
3206664 3208749 So, you're gonna go out there<br />and you're gonna say...
3208833 3211127 “Good night.<br />I've had a very lovely evening.”
3212420 3217550 Walk out the door, get in the car, go home,<br />jerk off and that's all you gonna do.
3222346 3225266 <i>Now it's up to you, girl</i>
3227017 3230980 <i>You'll be a woman soon</i>
3232148 3233566 <i>Please</i>

3267683 3270811 So listen, I gotta go, all right?
3273939 3277276 Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
3277359 3280070 You fu— Oh, Jesus Christ!
3280154 3282448 Oh, fuck me. Fuck me!
3282531 3286410 Oh— Come on, girl. We're gettin' outta<br />here. We gotta walk now.

3309183 3311268 Answer.
3311352 3313771 <i>Have you got the ring?</i>
3313854 3317691 - <i>Why, certainly.</i><br />- <i>join hands, you two lovebirds.</i>
3317775 3320152 <i>Please! Please!</i>
3320236 3322905 <i>Yes, yes. Hold hands, you lovebirds.</i>
3329161 3331372 Fuck you, Lance! Answer!
3336418 3338337 <i>Now what do you say?</i>
3338420 3340172 <i>I give up! I'll marry you!</i>
3343425 3346095 Lance! The goddamn phone's ringing!
3347805 3349473 I can hear it.
3349557 3352726 I thought you told those fuckin' assholes<br />never to call here this late!
3352810 3354311 Yeah, I told them.
3354395 3357648 And that is exactly what I'm going to tell<br />this fucking asshole right now.
3360150 3362945 - <i>Don't you dare strike me!</i><br />- Hello.
3363028 3365322 Lance! Vincent.
3365406 3368284 I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.<br />I'm coming to your house.
3369702 3372454 Hold your horses, man.<br />What's the problem?
3372538 3375791 - I got this chick, she's fuckin' Odin' on me!<br />- Well, don't bring her here!
3375875 3377835 I'm not even joking with you!
3377918 3380212 Do not be bringing some<br />fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!
3380296 3382339 - No choice.<br />- She's Odin'?
3382423 3385634 - She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!<br /><i>- just dandy.</i>
3385718 3389889 Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet,<br />take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.
3389972 3392391 - Negative!<br />- This is not my fuckin' problem, man!
3392474 3395185 You fucked her up,<br />you fuckin' deal with this!
3396270 3399106 Are you talkin' to me<br />on a cellular phone?
3399189 3401609 I don't know you. Who is this?<br />Don't come here!
3401692 3403861 I'm hanging up the phone!<br />Prank caller! Prank caller!
3414121 3416040 What the hell was that?
3418000 3421712 Have you lost your fucking mind? You were<br />talking about drug shit on a cellular phone!
3421795 3423422 Lance, help me.
3423505 3425925 - You crashed your car into my fucking house!<br />- Grab her feet.
3426008 3429929 Are you deaf? You are not bringing this<br />fucked-up bitch into my house!
3430012 3432431 This “fucked-up bitch” is<br />Marsellus Wallace's wife.
3432514 3434558 - Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?<br />- Yeah.
3434642 3437436 If she croaks on me,<br />I am a fucking grease spot!
3437519 3443108 I will be forced to tell him that you did<br />not help and let her die on your lawn.
3443192 3445653 Now, come on,<br />help me, help me. Pick her up.
3447196 3448656 Shit.
3451200 3452576 Lance!
3453661 3455079 Shit.
3455663 3458082 It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.
3458165 3460250 What the fuck's going on out here?
3461543 3463462 Who's she?
3463545 3466465 Go to the fridge and get the thing<br />with the adrenaline shot.
3466548 3468592 - What's wrong with her?<br />- She's ODing!
3468676 3470761 - Get her outta here!<br />- Get the shot!
3470844 3474348 - Fuck you! Fuck you too!<br />- What a fuckin' bitch.
3474431 3475975 Just keep talking to her, all right?
3476058 3478852 She's gettin' the shot. I'm going to go<br />get my little black medical book.
3478936 3480938 What the fuck you need a medical book for?
3481021 3483440 I've never had to give<br />an adrenaline shot before!
3483524 3486944 I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers!<br />My friends can handle their highs!
3487027 3489446 - Get the shot!<br />- I am, if you'll let me!
3489530 3491949 - I ain't stopping you!<br />- Stop talking to me. Start talking to her!
3492032 3493951 - Get the shot!<br />- All right!
3497621 3501125 - Hurry up. We're losing her!<br />- I'm looking as fast as I can!
3501208 3502668 What's he looking for?
3502751 3506046 - I don't know. Some book.<br />- What are you looking for?
3506130 3508549 - A little black medical book.<br />- What are you looking for?
3508632 3513220 My little black medical book!<br />It's like a textbook they give to nurses.
3513303 3516223 - I never saw no medical book.<br />- Trust me. I have one.
3516306 3518600 If it's so important, why don't<br />you keep it with the shot?
3518684 3520269 I don't know!<br />Stop bothering me!
3520352 3522980 While you're looking, that<br />girl's gonna die on our carpet.
3523063 3524732 You're never gonna find<br />anything in this mess!
3524815 3526984 I'm gonna fucking kill you<br />if you don't shut up!
3527067 3529194 Lance, get in here!
3529278 3531780 - Right?<br />- Get the fuck outta my way.
3531864 3533490 Pig.
3533574 3535743 Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot.
3535826 3538912 While I'm doing this,<br />you take off her shirt and find her heart.
3539913 3541999 - Does it gotta be exact?<br />- Yeah, it's gotta be exact.
3542082 3544293 We're giving her a shot in the heart,<br />so it's gotta be exact.
3544376 3546545 I don't know exactly where<br />her heart is. I think it's right here.
3546628 3548130 - That's it.<br />- This it?
3548213 3550799 All right, what I need is<br />a big, fat magic marker.
3550883 3552801 - You got it?<br />- What?
3552885 3555554 A magic marker. A felt pen!
3555637 3558265 A fuckin' black magic marker! Christ.
3558348 3563437 - Come on, man. Hurry up!<br />- Fuck! Okay, okay. Okay. I think it's ready.
3566607 3569068 - Hurry up, man.<br />- I'll tell you what to do.
3569151 3572071 - You're gonna give her the shot.<br />- No, you're gonna give her the shot.
3572154 3574073 I ain't giving her the shot.<br />I never done this before.
3574156 3576116 I never done this either!<br />I ain't starting now!
3576200 3578035 You brought her here.<br />You give her the shot.
3578118 3580621 The day I bring an ODing bitch<br />to your house, then I give her the shot.
3580704 3583624 - Give her the shot.<br />- Give it to me. Give me that.
3584708 3586627 All right, tell me what to do.
3586710 3590214 Okay, you're giving her an injection<br />of adrenaline straight to her heart.
3590297 3592674 But she's got a breastplate—<br />you gotta pierce through that.
3592758 3595719 You gotta bring the needle<br />down in a stabbing motion.
3595803 3599223 - I gotta stab her three times?<br />- No, just stab her once!
3599306 3602726 But it's gotta be hard enough to get<br />through her breastplate into her heart.
3602810 3605729 Once you do that,<br />you press down on the plunger.
3605813 3608273 - Okay. Then what happens?<br />- Kinda curious about that myself.
3608357 3611276 This ain't no fuckin' joke!<br />Am I gonna kill her?
3611360 3613237 She's supposed to come out<br />of it like that. It's—
3613320 3614780 All right, count to three.
3614863 3617032 - All right. Ready?<br />- One.
3622329 3623872 Two.
3632131 3633173 Three!
3648397 3651692 If you're all right, then say something.
3652609 3654278 Something.
3655445 3657114 That was fuckin' trippy.
3659366 3661702 - Ohh.<br />- Oh, man.
3687394 3689313 Mia. Mia.
3691481 3692900 What's—
3693984 3698405 What's your thoughts on— on—<br />on how to handle this?
3699364 3700908 What's yours?
3703952 3708248 Well, I'm of the opinion that<br />if Marsellus lived his whole life...
3708332 3710792 he doesn't need to know<br />nothing about this incident.
3712502 3716965 If Marsellus knew about this incident,<br />I'd be in as much trouble as you.
3717049 3718926 I seriously doubt that.
3719635 3722262 I can keep a secret if you can.
3724598 3726099 Shake on it?
3732272 3734024 Mum's the word?
3734107 3736068 Cool.
3736777 3739446 Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to<br />go home and have a heart attack.
3743116 3744117 Vincent.
3746995 3749998 Do you wanna hear my Fox <i>Force Five</i> joke?
3751083 3752292 Sure.
3753085 3756088 Except I think I'm still<br />a little too petrified to laugh.
3756171 3759091 No, you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny.
3759174 3761510 But if you still wanna hear it,<br />I'll tell it.
3762302 3764805 - I can't wait.<br />- Okay.
3764888 3767224 Three tomatoes are<br />walkin' down the street.
3767307 3769726 Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato<br />and Baby Tomato.
3769810 3774439 Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,<br />and Papa Tomato gets really angry.
3774523 3778568 Goes back and squishes him and says,<br />“Ketchup.”
3782489 3783907 Ketchup.
3788537 3790163 See you around.
3811727 3815439 <i>Oh, that paddlefoot. He funny, silly dog.</i>
3815522 3818525 <i>He think totem pole alive!</i>
3819359 3821320 <i>He Arctic tenderfoot!</i>
3823071 3825449 <i>That totem pole been here forever!</i>
3825532 3826992 Butch?
3827075 3829911 <i>One more thing, and we'll start for—</i>
3829995 3832914 - Butch, stop watching TV for a second.<br />- Yeah?
3832998 3836626 - You've got a special visitor.<br />- <i>Stand up. Stand up.</i>
3838795 3843091 Now, do you remember when I told you<br />your daddy died in a POW camp?
3844384 3848138 Well, this here is Captain Koons.
3848221 3850349 He was in the POW camp with Daddy.
3856938 3861568 Hello, little man.<br />Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.
3862652 3865072 See, I was a good friend of your dad's.
3865947 3870535 We were in that Hanoi pit of hell<br />together, over five years.
3871578 3872954 Hopefully...
3874289 3876249 you'll never have to<br />experience this yourself...
3876333 3880003 but when two men are in a situation<br />like me and your dad were...
3880087 3882881 for as long as we were...
3882964 3885884 you take on certain<br />responsibilities of the other.
3887344 3888970 If it'd been me who'd—
3890597 3896937 not made it, Major Coolidge'd<br />be talking right now to my son Jim.
3897813 3900607 But the way it turned out,<br />I'm talking to you.
3902025 3903443 Butch...
3905529 3907030 I got something for ya.
3913954 3916039 This watch I got here...
3916123 3920877 was first purchased by your<br />great-grandfather during the First World War.
3920961 3925382 It was bought in a little general store<br />in Knoxville, Tennessee.
3925465 3929261 Made by the first company<br />to ever make wristwatches.
3929344 3932097 Up 'til then, people just<br />carried pocket watches.
3932180 3935517 It was bought by<br />Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...
3935600 3938395 on the day he set sail for Paris.
3938478 3940772 This was your<br />great-grandfather's war watch...
3940856 3944443 and he wore it every day<br />he was in that war, and...
3944526 3948071 when he'd done his duty,<br />he went home to your great-grandmother...
3948155 3952576 took the watch off, put it in an old<br />coffee can, and in that can it stayed...
3952659 3956872 until your grandad, Dane Coolidge,<br />was called upon by his country...
3956955 3960876 to go overseas and fight<br />the Germans once again.
3960959 3963044 This time they called it World War II.
3964504 3968508 Your great-grandfather gave this watch<br />to your grandad for good luck.
3969551 3972554 Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't<br />as good as his old man's.
3972637 3975557 Dane was a Marine, and he was killed...
3975640 3978351 along with all the other Marines<br />at the battle of Wake Island.
3979227 3981688 Your grandad was facing death.
3982731 3984441 He knew it.
3984524 3988653 None of those boys had any illusions<br />about ever leaving that island alive...
3988737 3991948 so three days before<br />the Japanese took the island...
3992032 3997245 your grandad asked a gunner on<br />an Air Force transport, name of Winocki—
3997329 4000248 a man he'd never met before in his life—
4000332 4003293 to deliver to his infant son...
4003376 4007964 who he'd never seen in the flesh,<br />his gold watch.
4008048 4012385 Three days later, your grandad was dead,<br />but Winocki kept his word.
4012469 4016681 After the war was over,<br />he paid a visit to your grandmother...
4016765 4021019 delivering to your infant father<br />his dad's gold watch.
4021102 4023021 This watch.
4028902 4034324 This watch was on your daddy's wrist<br />when he was shot down over Hanoi.
4034407 4037827 He was captured, put in<br />a Vietnamese prison camp.
4037911 4041957 He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch...
4042040 4044834 it'd be confiscated, taken away.
4045627 4049339 The way your dad looked at it,<br />this watch was your birthright.
4049422 4053134 He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their<br />greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright...
4053218 4057347 so he hid it in one place<br />he knew he could hide something— his ass.
4057430 4060850 Five long years<br />he wore this watch up his ass.
4060934 4065105 Then he died of dysentery—<br />He give me the watch.
4065188 4069025 I hid this uncomfortable<br />hunk of metal up my ass two years.
4069109 4071027 <i>Then...</i>
4071111 4075198 after seven years,<br />I was sent home to my family and...
4075282 4076700 now...
4079619 4082581 little man, I give the watch to you.
4105437 4107355 It's time, Butch.
4115113 4118033 <i>In the lightweight division...</i>
4118116 4121244 <i>in the right corner<br />wearing the blue trunks...</i>
4121328 4124581 <i>weighing 210 pounds...</i>
4124664 4127834 <i>Floyd Ray Wilson!</i>
4130879 4133381 <i>It's official. It's official.<br />Wilson is dead!</i>
4133465 4135300 <i>Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest...</i>
4135383 4137802 <i>and hands down, the most brutal<br />fight this city's ever seen.</i>
4137886 4141222 <i>Coolidge was out of there faster than I've<br />ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.</i>
4141306 4143975 - <i>Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?</i><br />- <i>My guess would be yes.</i>
4144059 4148480 <i>I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way<br />to the realization of what he was doing.</i>
4148563 4150440 <i>I think any man would've<br />left the ring that fast.</i>
4150523 4153485 <i>Do you feel this tragedy<br />is gonna affect the world of boxing?</i>
4153568 4157489 <i>A tragedy like this can't help but shake<br />the world of boxing to its very foundations.</i>
4157572 4161451 <i>It's of paramount importance, during the sad<br />weeks ahead, the eyes of the WBA remain—</i>
4196861 4199155 Man, you know I didn't—
4199239 4202158 - Marsellus.<br />- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.
4202242 4204160 I didn't do it.
4204244 4206746 - How you doing?<br />- Great.
4206830 4208748 I never thanked you for dinner.
4211167 4213086 - What you got?<br />- He booked.
4213169 4216506 - His trainer?<br />- Says he don't know nothin'. I believe him.
4216589 4219759 - I think Butch surprised his ass same as us.<br />- No, we don't wanna think.
4219843 4223430 We wanna know. Take him to the kennel,<br />sic the dogs on his ass.
4223513 4226349 We'll find out for goddamn sure<br />what he knows and what he don't.
4226433 4228226 Butch's search— how do you want it done?
4228893 4231604 I'm prepared to scour the Earth<br />for that motherfucker.
4231688 4234941 If Butch goes to Indochina, I want<br />a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...
4235024 4239779 - ready to pop a cap in his ass.<br />- I will take care of it.
4249622 4250999 Mister.
4254919 4257380 - Hey, mister.<br />- What?
4257464 4262260 You were in that fight,<br />the fight on the radio.
4262343 4265805 - You're the fighter?<br />- Whatever gave you that idea?
4265889 4268600 No, come on.
4268683 4270643 You're him.
4270727 4273146 I know you're him.
4274898 4276775 Tell me you're him.
4276858 4278777 I'm him.
4279861 4281988 You killed the other boxing man.
4285950 4288036 He's dead?
4288119 4290538 The radio said he was dead.
4293333 4295543 Sorry about that, Floyd.
4296836 4299339 What does it feel like?
4299422 4301341 What does what feel like?
4301424 4302926 Killing a man.
4305136 4309182 Beating another man to death<br />with your bare hands.
4309766 4311351 What are you, a weirdo?
4311434 4316022 No. It is a subject<br />I have much interest in.
4318274 4321945 You are the first person<br />I have ever met who has killed somebody.
4324697 4326157 So?
4327200 4329994 What does it feel like to kill a man?
4331579 4333206 I'll tell you what.
4333289 4336751 Give me one of them cigarettes you got up<br />there and I'll tell you all about it.
4355228 4358481 So, Esmarelda...
4359816 4363194 Villa Lobos— is that Mexican?
4363278 4366489 The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian.
4366573 4369826 - That's some handle you got there, honey.<br />- Thank you.
4369909 4371870 And what is your name?
4371953 4373621 Butch.
4374289 4375498 Butch.
4376082 4377584 What does it mean?
4377667 4380169 I'm an American, honey.<br />Our names don't mean shit.
4381588 4385717 So, moving right along,<br />Esmarelda...
4385800 4388094 what is it you want to know?
4388177 4393057 - I want to know what it feels like to kill a man.<br />- I couldn't tell ya.
4398938 4401649 I didn't know he was dead<br />'til you told me he was dead.
4403443 4406279 Now that I know he's dead,<br />you wanna know how I feel about it?
4411784 4414287 I don't feel the least bit bad about it.
4426215 4427967 What the fuck'd I tell ya?
4428676 4432597 As soon as the word got out the fix was<br />in, man, the odds went through the roof.
4432680 4434891 I know. I know. Unbelievable.
4434974 4438394 Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was a better<br />boxer, he'd still be alive.
4438478 4439938 If he never laced up his gloves...
4440021 4442899 which he never shoulda done in the first<br />fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.
4444484 4448571 Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?<br />It's over now.
4448655 4451324 Yeah, well, enough about the poor,<br />unfortunate Mr. Floyd.
4451407 4454077 Let's talk about the rich<br />and prosperous Mr. Butch.
4455411 4457330 How many bookies did you lay it around on?
4458414 4460959 All eight? How long to collect?
4462502 4465421 So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?<br />No, I understand.
4465505 4468633 A few stragglers aside.<br />Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.
4468716 4470927 That is great news, man.
4471010 4474430 Yeah. No, me and Fabienne<br />are gonna leave in the morning.
4475306 4478559 It'll probably take us<br />a couple days to get down to Knoxville.
4478643 4480353 Okay, my brother.
4481688 4483982 You're right.<br />You're goddamn right.
4485066 4488569 All right, Scotty, next time I see you,<br />it'll be on Tennessee time.
4488653 4490154 Cool, brother.
4506170 4508047 $45.60.
4512385 4516848 And... here's a little something<br />for the effort.
4516931 4521477 Now... if anybody asks you who your fare<br />was tonight, what are you gonna say?
4521561 4522979 The truth.
4523062 4526858 Three well-dressed,<br />slightly toasted Mexicans.
4528943 4531320 <i>Bonsoir,</i> Esmarelda Villa Lobos.
4531404 4533948 <i>Buenas noches,</i> Butch.
4545084 4546961 Whew.
4548379 4550339 Keep the light off.
4550423 4553384 - Is that better, sugar pop?<br />- Owl
4557847 4559766 Hard day at the office?
4559849 4561768 Pretty hard.
4561851 4563478 Got in a fight.
4564145 4566314 Poor baby.
4566397 4568941 Can you make spoons?
4569025 4571110 You know what?<br />I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.
4571194 4574947 - I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.<br />- I like the way you stink.
4576032 4577950 Let me take this jacket off.
4580620 4584165 - I was looking at myself in the mirror.<br />- Uh-huh.
4584248 4586167 I wish I had a pot.
4587960 4590963 You were looking at yourself in the mirror<br />and you wish you had some pot?
4591047 4594092 A pot. A pot belly.
4594967 4597095 Pot bellies are sexy.
4597178 4599472 Well, you should be happy...
4600389 4601891 'cause you have one.
4601974 4605019 Shut up, fatso. I don't have a pot.
4605103 4608940 I have a bit of a tummy,<br />like Madonna when she did “Lucky Star.”
4609023 4610733 It's not the same thing.
4610817 4613945 I didn't know there was such a difference<br />between a pot belly and a tummy.
4614028 4615947 The difference is huge.
4618032 4620451 Would you like it if I had a pot belly?
4620535 4622203 No.
4622286 4626624 Pot bellies make a man<br />look either oafish or like a gorilla.
4626707 4630128 But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy.
4630211 4635633 The rest of you is normal— normal face,<br />normal legs, normal hips, normal ass—
4635716 4639762 but with a big, perfectly round pot belly.
4639846 4644559 If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt<br />two sizes too small to accentuate it.
4644642 4647270 You think men would find that attractive?
4647353 4650523 I don't give a damn<br />what men find attractive.
4650606 4654068 It's unfortunate what we find pleasing<br />to the touch and pleasing to the eye...
4654152 4656070 is seldom the same.
4659490 4663077 If you had a pot belly,<br />I would punch you in it.
4663161 4666080 - You'd punch me in the belly?<br />- Right in the belly.
4666164 4668082 Ohh! I'd smother you!
4668166 4672086 I'd drop it right on your face<br />'til you couldn't breathe!
4672170 4674088 - You'd do that?<br />- Yeah.
4674172 4676090 - Promise?<br />- Yeah.
4690104 4691606 Did you get everything?
4691689 4694650 - Yes, I did.<br />- Good job, sugar pop.
4694734 4696652 Did everything go as planned?
4696736 4699488 You didn't listen to the— Ow!
4699572 4701449 You didn't listen to the radio?
4701532 4704827 I never listen to your fights.<br />Were you the winner?
4704911 4707205 I won, all right.
4707288 4710249 - Are you still retiring?<br />- Sure am.
4711000 4712710 So it all worked out in the finish.
4714128 4715922 We're not at the finish yet, baby.
4725514 4727934 We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?
4729936 4732396 If they find us, they'll kill us,<br />won't they?
4734941 4736901 But they won't find us, will they?
4740780 4742990 Do you still want me to go with you?
4745284 4748955 I don't want to be<br />a burden or a nuisance. It's—
4755586 4757088 Say it.
4758673 4762677 Fabienne,<br />I want you to be with me.
4763886 4766889 - Forever?<br />- Forever and ever.
4769016 4770977 Do you love me?
4771060 4773062 Very, very much.
4778776 4781320 - Butch.<br />- Yes?
4782780 4785366 Will you give me oral pleasure?
4786867 4788828 Will you kiss it?
4790746 4792915 But you first.
4792999 4795334 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
4806053 4807305 Butch.
4827408 4829827 I think I cracked a rib.
4829910 4833331 - Giving me oral pleasure?<br />- No, retard, from the fight.
4833414 4836834 - Don't call me retard.<br />- My name is Fabby.
4836917 4839420 - My name is Fabienne!<br />- Stop it.
4839503 4841005 - Stop it!<br />- My name is Fabi—
4841088 4844425 Shut up, fuckhead!<br />I hate that mongoloid voice.
4844508 4847595 Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
4847678 4849597 I take it back.
4852600 4855519 Will you hand me a dry towel,<br />Miss Beautiful Tulip?
4855603 4859523 Oh, I like that.<br />I like being called a tulip.
4859607 4862026 Tulip is much better than mongoloid.
4862109 4865029 I didn't call you a mongoloid.<br />I called you a retard.
4865112 4867239 And I took it back.
4867323 4869408 Butch?
4869492 4871410 Yes, lemon pie?
4871494 4874914 - Where are we going to go?<br />- Well, I'm not sure yet.
4874997 4877124 Wherever you want.
4877208 4879126 We're gonna get a lot<br />of money from this...
4879210 4881379 but it ain't gonna be the kind of money...
4881462 4884799 that we can live like hogs<br />in the fathouse forever.
4885591 4889637 I was thinking maybe we could go down<br />some place in the South Pacific.
4889720 4893140 Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna<br />carry us a long way down there.
4893224 4896143 - If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?<br />- You betcha.
4896227 4899647 And if after a while you didn't dig that,<br />we could go some place else.
4899730 4902149 Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.
4902233 4904151 But I do not speak Spanish.
4904235 4907196 Well, you do not speak Bora-Boran either.
4907279 4908906 Besides, Mexican's easy.
4911450 4914245 - What does that mean?<br />- Where is the shoe store?
4915246 4916414 Spit, please.
4919792 4921585 Excellent pronunciation.
4923754 4926006 You'll be my little <i>mamacita</i> in no time.
4929718 4931887 - What time is it?<br />- What time is it?
4931971 4933472 Time for bed.
4934640 4936600 Sweet dreams, jellybean.
4944316 4945734 Butch?
4952158 4953576 Never mind.
4963752 4967840 <i>Merde!</i> You startled me.<br />Did you have a bad dream?
4978267 4980019 What is this you're watching?
4981103 4984523 A motorcycle movie.<br />I'm not sure the name.
4986442 4989528 - Are you watching it?<br />- In a way.
4992031 4994742 It's a little early in the morning<br />for explosions and war.
4997995 4999455 What was it about?
4999538 5002708 How should I know?<br />You were the one watching it.
5002791 5006795 - No, imbecile, what was your dream about?<br />- I don't know.
5006879 5008797 I don't remember.
5008881 5011759 It's really rare<br />that I remember my dreams.
5011842 5014136 Well, let's look<br />at the grumpy man in the morning.
5016889 5019600 Why don't you get up<br />and we'll get some breakfast.
5019683 5021393 One more kiss and I'll get up.
5024688 5027816 - Satisfied?<br />- Yep.
5029026 5032029 Get up, lazy bones!
5033531 5034573 God.
5035866 5039370 - What time is it?<br />- Almost 9:00 in the morning.
5039453 5043207 - What time does our train arrive?<br />- 11:00.
5043290 5046585 - You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast?<br />- What, lemon pie?
5047753 5053842 I'm gonna order a big plate of<br />blueberry pancakes with maple syrup...
5053926 5057346 eggs over easy and five sausages.
5057429 5059640 Anything to drink with that?
5059723 5062101 Wow, that looks nice.
5063435 5069275 To drink— a tall glass of orange juice<br />and a black cup of coffee.
5069358 5073904 - After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.<br />- Pie for breakfast?
5073988 5077283 Any time of the day<br />is a good time for pie.
5077992 5080452 Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes.
5080536 5083998 And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese.
5084081 5086000 Where's my watch?
5090462 5092715 It's there.
5092798 5095926 - No, it's not.<br />- Have you looked?
5096010 5098762 Yes, I've fuckin' looked.<br />What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?
5099805 5101932 You sure you got it?
5102016 5104310 Yes. Bedside table drawer.
5104393 5107521 - On the little kangaroo?<br />- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.
5107605 5110816 Yeah, well, it's not here now.
5111567 5113694 Well, it should be.
5113777 5117615 Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's<br />not here now! So where the fuck is it?
5123162 5126624 Fabienne, where's my father's<br />fucking watch?
5128292 5131837 Do you have any idea what he had to go<br />through to get me that watch?
5132379 5135215 I don't have time to go into it,<br />but he went through a lot.
5135299 5138886 All this other shit you could've set on<br />fire, but I specifically reminded you...
5138969 5142514 not to forget the fucking watch!<br />Now think.
5142598 5146101 - Did you get it?<br />- I believe so.
5146185 5149480 You believe 50? What the fuck does that<br />mean? You either did or didn't get it.
5150856 5152816 Then I did.
5154193 5156070 Are you sure?
5157696 5159156 No.
5161241 5163160 Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
5163243 5165579 Motherfucker! Motherfuckin'—
5167539 5170292 Do you know how fucking stupid<br />you fucking are?
5170376 5172336 No!
5174963 5176882 It's not your fault.
5181720 5184139 You left it at the apartment.
5189895 5192481 If you left it at the apartment,<br />it's not your fault.
5195234 5197111 I had you bring a bunch of stuff.
5200572 5202074 I reminded you about it...
5202157 5205953 but I didn't illustrate<br />how personal the watch was to me.
5207287 5210332 If all I gave a fuck about was the watch,<br />I shoulda told you that.
5211500 5213919 You're not a mind reader.
5214002 5215504 Are you?
5226932 5227975 I'm sorry.
5228058 5231645 Don't be. Just means I can't have<br />breakfast with you.
5232730 5234440 Why does it mean that?
5237025 5240320 Because I gotta go back<br />to my apartment and get my watch.
5241572 5244074 Won't the gangsters<br />be looking for you there?
5244158 5247244 Well, that's what I'm gonna find out.
5248495 5252750 If they are, and I don't think<br />I can handle it, then I'll split.
5252833 5258130 I saw your watch.<br />I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.
5264052 5266430 Here's some money.<br />Go out and get those pancakes.
5266513 5268390 Have a nice breakfast.
5268474 5271226 I'll take your Honda. I'll be back before<br />you can say blueberry pie.
5271310 5272811 Blueberry pie.
5274480 5276607 Maybe not that fast.
5276690 5279902 - But pretty fast. Okay?<br />- Okay.
5279985 5282279 - Bye.<br />- Bye.
5282362 5284948 Shit! Of all the fuckin' things<br />she could fuckin' forget...
5285032 5287034 she forgets my father's watch!
5287117 5288786 I specifically reminded her—
5288869 5291497 Bedside table, on the kangaroo.
5291580 5294833 I said the words:<br />“Don't forget my father's watch.”
5310349 5313769 <i>Visit the jackrabbit Slim's nearest you...</i>
5451782 5453700 Lookin' good, Butch.

5695275 5697527 - Oh, my God.<br />- He's dead.
5707412 5711333 If you need someone to go to court, I'll be<br />glad to help. That guy was a drunken maniac.
5711416 5714336 He hit you, then he crashed into that car.
5714419 5716296 - Who?<br />- Him.
5720425 5722594 I'll be damned.
5739319 5741071 I'm shot!

5788576 5791079 Hold it right there, goddamn it.
5791162 5794916 - This ain't none of your business, mister.<br />- I'm makin' it my business.
5795000 5797711 - Toss the weapon.<br />- You don't understand, man.
5797794 5799838 Toss the weapon.
5801423 5805051 <i>It's time</i>
5805135 5807846 - <i>To find love</i><br />- Take your foot off the nigger.

5812058 5814853 This motherfucker's trying to<br />kill me.

5850013 5853475 <i>Whoa, my angel</i>
5856061 5859189 <i>Down to you</i>
5897811 5901773 Nobody kills anybody in my place<br />of business except me or Zed.
5906027 5907695 That's Zed.
5920625 5923545 - I thought you said you waited for me.<br />- I did.
5928842 5931302 Then how come they're all beat up?
5932512 5935598 They did that to each other, man.<br />They came in fightin'.
5935682 5937767 Now, this 'un right here...
5937851 5940770 - he was gonna shoot that one.<br />- Is that right?
5940854 5943481 You gonna shoot him, boy?
5948153 5951197 Hey, is Grace all right out front?
5951281 5954492 - Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?<br />- No, it's Thursday.
5954576 5956244 She oughta be fine.
5959664 5962917 Well, bring out the gimp.
5964002 5966754 I think the gimp's sleepin'.
5966838 5969674 Then I guess you'll just have to go<br />wake him up now, won't you?
6009881 6011799 Get up.
6025063 6027023 Get down.
6037325 6039494 Which one of 'em you wanna do first?
6041079 6043331 I ain't for sure yet.
6047377 6050004 Eenie-meenie-minie-mo...

6433596 6436307 You hear me talkin', hillbilly boy?
6437558 6440102 I ain't through with you by a damn sight!
6440186 6442647 I'm gonna get medieval on your ass.
6446400 6449320 I meant what now between me and you.

6479433 6480935 Two things.
6482687 6485648 Don't tell nobody about this.
6487108 6490736 This shit is between me, you...
6490820 6495282 and Mr. “Soon-to-be-livin'-the-rest<br />of-his-short-ass-life-in-agonizing-pain”...
6495366 6497284 rapist here.
6498577 6501330 It ain't nobody else's business.
6501414 6503332 Two—
6503416 6506919 You leave town tonight. Right now.
6508170 6511882 And when you gone,<br />you stay gone...
6511966 6513884 or you be gone.
6514885 6517680 You lost all your LA privileges. Deal?
6519932 6521267 Deal.
6523102 6525062 Get your ass outta here.
6551505 6553424 Oh, shit.
6586957 6588501 Fabienne!
6590294 6591712 Fabienne!
6594632 6596717 Fabienne! Come on, baby.
6596801 6598677 Come on. Get your shit.<br />We gotta go right now.
6598761 6600387 I was so worried.<br />What about our bags?
6600471 6602723 Fuck the bags; if we don't split<br />right now, we'll miss the train.
6602807 6605726 - Come on, I'll be downstairs.<br />- Is everything well?
6605810 6609438 - Just come on! No talking now!<br />- Are we in danger?
6613067 6614652 Come on, honey!
6617738 6619657 Where did you get this motorcycle?
6619740 6622201 It's not a motorcycle, baby.<br />It's a chopper. Let's go.
6622284 6624245 What happened to my Honda?
6624328 6628082 I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that<br />Honda. Will you come on now, please?
6628165 6630626 Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.
6635131 6636090 You're hurt?
6636173 6638592 No, no, I might've broken<br />my nose. It's no biggie.
6638676 6641595 Come on. Hop on. Baby, please, we—
6641679 6644473 Honey, we gotta hit<br />the fuckin' road! Get on!
6646308 6650437 Oh, baby, I'm sorry.<br />Come here, come here. I'm sorry.
6651730 6653232 I'm so sorry.
6653315 6655734 You were gone so long,<br />I started to think dreadful thoughts.
6655818 6658737 I didn't mean to worry you.<br />Everything's fine.
6658821 6660739 - How was your breakfast?<br />- It was good.
6660823 6662741 Did you get the blueberry pancakes?
6662825 6665744 They didn't have blueberry; I had to get<br />buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?
6665828 6668747 Since I left you, this has been,<br />without a doubt...
6668831 6673043 the single weirdest fuckin' day<br />of my life— I'll tell you all about it.
6673127 6674920 Gotta go. Come on.
6675004 6677798 Butch, whose motorcycle is this?
6677882 6680467 - It's a chopper, baby.<br />- Whose chopper is this?
6680551 6682469 - Zed's.<br />- Who's Zed?
6682553 6685472 Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.
6701280 6703574 Yes, you did, Brett!
6703657 6707161 You tried to fuck him, and Marsellus<br />Wallace don't liked to be fucked...
6707244 6709663 by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
6709747 6712833 - Oh, God, please, I don't wanna die.<br />- You read the Bible, Brett?
6712917 6716337 - Yes!<br />- Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
6716420 6718589 Sorta fits the occasion.
6718672 6721967 Ezekiel 25:17.
6722051 6726347 “The path of the righteous man<br />is beset on all sides...
6726430 6731644 by the inequities of the selfish<br />and the tyranny of evil men.
6731727 6736565 Blessed is he who, in the name<br />of charity and good will...
6736649 6739693 shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness...
6739777 6742279 for he is truly his brother's keeper...
6742363 6745074 and the finder of lost children.
6745157 6751664 And I will strike down upon thee<br />with great vengeance and furious anger...
6751747 6756126 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy my brothers.
6756210 6760047 And you will know my name is the Lord...
6760130 6763509 when I lay my vengeance upon thee.”
6771600 6774061 I'm fucked. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
6774144 6777064 - Is he a friend of yours?<br />- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.
6777147 6779733 Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.
6779817 6781568 Better tell him to shut up.<br />He's gettin' on my nerves.
6781652 6784446 Marvin. Marvin. Marvin!
6784530 6786824 I'd knock that shit off if I was you.
6787408 6790577 Die, you motherfuckers! Die!
6818731 6822151 Why the fuck didn't you<br />tell us somebody was in the bathroom?
6822234 6825112 Slip your mind? Did you forget that<br />someone was in there...
6825195 6827072 with a goddamn hand cannon?
6827156 6830367 You see the size of that gun<br />he fired at us? It was bigger than him.
6835873 6838584 We should be fuckin' dead, man.
6838667 6840586 I know. We was lucky.
6840669 6843756 No, no, no, no. That shit wasn't luck.
6843839 6845174 Yeah, maybe.
6845257 6848052 This was divine intervention.
6848135 6850054 You know what divine intervention is?
6855934 6857853 I think so.
6857936 6861357 That means that God came down from heaven<br />and stopped the bullets.
6861440 6863859 That's right.<br />That's exactly what it means.
6863942 6866904 God came down from heaven<br />and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.
6868155 6870115 I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.
6870199 6872576 Don't do that.<br />Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!
6872659 6874745 What just happened here<br />was a fuckin' miracle!
6874828 6876622 Chill. This shit happens.
6876705 6879458 Wrong! Wrong. This shit<br />doesn't just happen.
6879541 6882961 Do you want to continue<br />this theological discussion in a car...
6883045 6885506 or in a jailhouse with the cops?
6885589 6887257 We should be fuckin' dead, my friend!
6888092 6892471 What happened here was a miracle,<br />and I want you to fucking acknowledge it!
6892554 6896809 All right, it was a miracle.<br />Can we go now?
6904274 6907361 Let's go, nigger! Come on! Shit.
6909405 6911365 You ever seen that show <i>Cops?</i>
6911448 6914368 I was watching it one time<br />and there was this cop on...
6914451 6918372 and he was talkin' about this gunfight he<br />had in the hallway with this guy, right?
6918455 6921875 He just unloaded on this guy and nothin'<br />happened. He didn't hit nothin'.
6921959 6924503 Okay? It was just him and this guy.
6924586 6928298 I mean, you know,<br />it's freaky, but it happens.
6928382 6930759 You wanna play blind man,<br />go walk with the shepherd...
6930843 6933303 but me, my eyes<br />are wide fuckin' open.
6933387 6935097 What the fuck does that mean?
6935180 6936682 It means that's it for me.
6936765 6939059 From here on in, you can<br />consider my ass retired.
6939143 6941311 - Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.<br />- Don't blaspheme.
6941395 6944440 - I said, don't do that!<br />- Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us?
6944523 6947568 Look, I'm tellin'<br />Marsellus today— I'm through.
6947651 6950571 - Why don't you tell him at the same time why?<br />- Don't worry, I will.
6950654 6954658 - And I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass off.<br />- I don't give a damn if he does.
6955409 6957828 Marvin, what do you make of all this?
6957911 6960330 Man, I don't even have an opinion.
6960414 6964668 You gotta have an opinion. You think God<br />came down from heaven and stopped—
6965335 6966920 What the fuck's happenin'?
6967004 6968714 - Shit, man!<br />- Man!
6968797 6971717 - Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.<br />- Why the fuck'd you do that?
6971800 6973427 I didn't mean it. It was an accident.
6973510 6975971 Man, I seen some crazy-ass<br />shit in my time, but this—
6976054 6979725 Chill out, man! It was an accident.<br />We probably went over a bump or somethin'.
6979808 6981727 The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump.
6981810 6985105 I didn't mean to shoot<br />the son of a bitch. The gun went off.
6985189 6988609 Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on a city<br />street in broad daylight here!
6988692 6990611 - I don't believe it!<br />- We", believe it now, motherfucker!
6990694 6995157 We gotta get this car off the road. Cops<br />notice shit like a car drenched in blood.
6995240 6998160 - Just take it to a friendly place, that's all!<br />- This is the Valley, Vincent.
6998243 7000662 Marsellus ain't got<br />no friendly places in the Valley.
7000746 7003165 - Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man!<br />- Shit!
7003248 7005667 - What you doing?<br />- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.
7005751 7009254 - Where's Toluca Lake?<br />- Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.
7009922 7012799 If Jimmie's ass ain't home,<br />I don't know what the fuck we gonna do...
7012883 7015302 'cause I ain't got<br />no other partners in 818.
7015385 7019306 Jimmie, how you doin', man?<br />It's Jules. Just listen up, man.
7019389 7023310 Me and my homeboy are in a car,<br />and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.
7023393 7025562 I need to use your garage<br />for a couple hours.
7027064 7029983 We gotta be real fuckin' delicate<br />with this Jimmie situation.
7030067 7032694 He's one remark away<br />from kickin' our asses out the door.
7032778 7036698 - If he does, what do we do?<br />- We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls...
7036782 7039701 but I don't want it to reach that pitch—<br />Jimmie's a friend.
7039785 7041912 You don't come into your friend's house<br />and start tellin' him what's what.
7041995 7044206 Just tell him not to be abusive.
7044289 7046708 He kinda freaked out back there<br />when he saw Marvin.
7046792 7049962 Put yourself in his position—<br />It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.
7050045 7051964 He wasn't expectin' this shit.
7052047 7054967 We gotta remember here<br />who's doin' who a favor.
7055050 7058887 If that favor means I gotta take shit, he<br />can stick that favor straight up his ass.
7058971 7061390 Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd<br />you just do to his towel, man?
7061473 7062975 I was dryin' my hands!
7063058 7065978 - You're supposed to wash 'em first!<br />- You watched me wash 'em.
7066061 7069314 - I watched you get 'em wet.<br />- I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.
7069398 7071608 Maybe if he'd had Lava<br />I coulda done a better job.
7071692 7073610 I used the same fuckin' soap you did...
7073694 7076613 and when I finished, the towel didn't look<br />like no goddamn maxi-pad!
7076697 7078865 What if he was to come in here<br />and see his towel like this?
7078949 7082244 It's shit like this that's gonna bring<br />this situation to a head, man!
7083870 7087291 Look, I ain't threatenin' you<br />or nothin', all right?
7087374 7091837 You know I respect you and all. But just<br />don't put me in this position, all right?
7091920 7094590 All right. Fine. Fine.
7094673 7096842 Ask me nice like that, no problem.
7097676 7100637 Just go handle your friend.<br />Go ahead. I don't care.
7103473 7105225 Goddamn, Jimmie!
7105309 7107352 This some serious gourmet shit.
7107436 7111398 Me and Vincent would've been satisfied<br />with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.
7111481 7115902 Right? And he springs this<br />serious gourmet shit on us.
7115986 7118530 - What flavor is this?<br />- Knock it off, Julie.
7118614 7119573 What?
7119656 7122659 I don't need you to tell me<br />how fuckin' good my coffee is.
7122743 7125245 I'm the one who buys it.<br />I know how good it is.
7125329 7127205 When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.
7127289 7130917 I buy the gourmet expensive stuff<br />'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
7131001 7134921 But you know what's on my mind right now?<br />It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.
7135005 7137174 It's the dead nigger in my garage.
7137257 7138967 Jimmie, don't even worry—
7139051 7141094 Don't tell me about anything.<br />I wanna ask you a question.
7141178 7142679 When you came pulling in here...
7142763 7145932 did you notice the sign on the front of my<br />house that said, “Dead nigger storage”?
7146016 7147726 You know I ain't seen no—
7147809 7151480 Did you notice the sign on the front of<br />my house that said, “Dead nigger storage”?
7152147 7154274 No. I didn't.
7154358 7157235 - You know why you didn't see that sign?<br />- Why?
7157319 7161865 'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead<br />niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!
7161948 7164868 - We're not gonna store the motherfucker—<br />- Don't you fuckin' realize...
7164951 7169373 that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead<br />body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?
7169456 7172668 No marriage counselor. No trial separation.<br />I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.
7172751 7176088 Okay? And I don't wanna<br />get fuckin' divorced!
7176171 7181176 Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,<br />but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.
7181259 7183345 Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain't gonna leave you.
7183428 7187349 Don't fuckin' “Jimmie” me,<br />Jules! Okay? Don't fuckin' “Jimmie” me.
7187432 7191395 There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna<br />make me forget I love my wife. Is there?
7193939 7199194 Now, look, you know, she comes home<br />from work in about an hour and a half.
7199277 7201905 The graveyard shift at the hospital.
7201988 7205492 You gotta make some phone calls?<br />You gotta call some people?
7205575 7209496 Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck<br />out of my house before she gets here.
7209579 7212416 That's Kool and the Gang.<br />We don't wanna fuck your shit up.
7212499 7215502 All I wanna do is call my people<br />and get 'em to bring us in.
7215585 7218505 You're fucking my shit up right now!
7218588 7221675 You're gonna fuck my shit up<br />big time if Bonnie comes home.
7221758 7225262 Do me that favor, all right? The phone is<br />in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.
7225345 7228265 Well, say she comes home.
7228348 7229975 What do you think she'll do?
7232269 7234688 Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.
7234771 7236982 That ain't no kinda answer.
7237065 7240110 I mean, you know, I don't.<br />How much? A lot or a little?
7240193 7245031 You got to appreciate what an explosive<br />element this Bonnie situation is.
7245115 7249035 <i>She comes home from a hard day's work,<br />finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen...</i>
7249119 7251037 <i>doing a bunch of gangster shit...</i>
7251121 7254207 <i>there ain't no tellin'<br />what she's liable to do.</i>
7256376 7258295 Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.
7258378 7260964 All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs.
7261047 7263091 I don't wanna hear about<br />no motherfuckin' ifs!
7263175 7264843 All I want to hear from your ass is...
7264926 7267971 “You ain't got no problem, Jules,<br />I'm on the motherfucker.
7268054 7272184 Chill them niggers out and wait for the<br />cavalry, which should be coming directly.”
7272267 7275437 You ain't got no problem, Jules.
7275520 7277647 I'm on the motherfucker.
7277731 7282819 Chill them niggers out and wait for the<br />Wolf, who should be coming directly.
7283528 7285280 You sendin' the Wolf?
7285363 7287532 Oh, you feel better, motherfucker?
7287616 7289910 Shit, negro!
7289993 7292120 That's all you had to say!
7293163 7295165 She the hysterical type?
7296458 7298001 When is she due?
7301630 7303548 Give me the principals' names again.
7303632 7305550 Place your bets.
7306635 7309012 - Jules.<br />- Cards, please.
7310347 7312307 Vincent.
7317020 7318522 Jimmie.
7320190 7321566 Bonnie.
7327739 7330700 It's 30 minutes away. I'll be there in 10.
7347676 7350595 You're... Jimmie, right?<br />This is your house?
7350679 7354307 - It sure is.<br />- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.
7354391 7357310 - Good. We got one.<br />- So I heard. May I come in?
7357394 7359271 Yeah. Please do.
7359354 7363024 You must be Jules.<br />Which would make you... Vincent.
7363108 7365527 Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.
7365610 7368321 If I was informed correctly, the clock<br />is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?
7368405 7369865 One hundred percent.
7369948 7373368 Your wife Bonnie comes home<br />at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?
7373451 7374536 Uh-huh.
7374619 7379124 I was led to believe if she comes home and<br />finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much.
7379207 7380667 She wouldn't at that.
7380750 7383461 That gives us 40 minutes<br />to get the fuck outta Dodge...
7383545 7387007 which, if you do what I say, when I say it,<br />should be plenty.
7387090 7391428 Now, you got a corpse in a car,<br />minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.
7399144 7401062 - Jimmie.<br />- Uh-huh.
7401146 7404190 Do me a favor, will ya?<br />Thought I smelled some coffee back there.
7404274 7408111 - Would you make me a cup?<br />- Yeah, sure.
7409571 7412490 Oh, how do you take it?
7412574 7414117 Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
7417495 7420248 About the car, is there anything<br />I need to know? Does it stall?
7420332 7423627 Does it smoke? Does it<br />make a lot of noise? Is there gas in it?
7423710 7427339 - Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.<br />- Positive?
7427422 7430133 Don't get me on the road and I find out<br />the brake lights don't work.
7430216 7433303 As far as I know,<br />the motherfucker's tip-top.
7433386 7435263 Good enough.
7435347 7437349 Let's go back to the kitchen.
7443021 7445482 - Here you go, Mr. Wolf.<br />- Thank you, Jimmie.
7453823 7455909 Okay, first thing. You two.
7455992 7458370 Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
7458453 7461122 Now, Jimmie, this looks to be<br />a pretty domesticated house.
7461206 7464584 That would lead me to believe<br />you got cleansers and shit.
7464668 7465752 Yeah. Under the sink.
7465835 7469255 Good. What I need you two fellas to do is<br />take those cleaning products...
7469339 7473343 and clean the inside<br />of the car— I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.
7473426 7477347 Go in the back seat, scoop up all those<br />little pieces of brain and skull.
7477430 7479849 Get it out of there.<br />Wipe down the upholstery.
7479933 7483353 It don't need to be spick-and-span.<br />You don't need to eat off it.
7483436 7487774 Just give it a good once-over. What you need<br />to take care of are the really messy parts.
7487857 7491945 The pools of blood that have collected,<br />you gotta soak that shit up.
7492028 7494447 We need to raid your linen closet.
7494531 7497450 I need blankets,<br />I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.
7497534 7501162 The thicker the better, the darker<br />the better. No whites. Can't use 'em.
7501246 7506543 We'll need to camouflage the front seat<br />and back seat and floorboards...
7506626 7508545 with quilts and blankets...
7508628 7512549 so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout<br />in the car, the subterfuge won't last...
7512632 7515468 but at a glance the car<br />will appear to be normal.
7515552 7517595 Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work.
7517679 7519431 Please would be nice.
7520890 7523893 - Come again?<br />- I said, a please would be nice.
7525729 7529607 Get it straight, Buster. I'm not here to say<br />please. I'm here to tell you what to do.
7531401 7533528 And if self-preservation<br />is an instinct you possess...
7533611 7536322 you'd better fuckin' do it<br />and do it quick.
7536406 7540785 I'm here to help. If my help's not<br />appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.
7540869 7543663 No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;<br />your help is definitely appreciated.
7543747 7547167 Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't<br />mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.
7547250 7550086 I just don't like people<br />barkin' orders at me.
7550170 7553173 If I'm curt with you,<br />it's because time is a factor.
7553256 7557886 I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys<br />to act fast if you wanna get out of this.
7557969 7561431 So pretty please,<br />with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.
7565935 7569064 Don't be lookin' at me like that,<br />all right? I can feel your look.
7572317 7574986 It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
7577072 7578490 Green.
7580617 7582786 Nothin' except for the mess inside.
7585747 7588166 About 20 minutes.
7589667 7591628 Nobody who'll be missed.
7593671 7596633 You're a good man, Joe. Thanks a bunch.
7597717 7601638 - How we comin', Jimmie?<br />- Pretty good. I got it all here, but...
7602972 7604599 Mr. Wolf, you gotta<br />understand something.
7604682 7606392 Winston, Jimmie, Winston.
7606476 7609979 Okay. You gotta understand<br />something, Winston.
7610063 7611981 No, thank you.
7612065 7615193 This is our best linen here...
7615276 7620365 and it was a wedding present<br />from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny.
7620448 7622784 They're not with us anymore.<br />I wanna help—
7622867 7626454 Let me ask you a question.<br />If you don't mind.
7626538 7628206 No, no, please. Go ahead.
7629791 7634671 Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,<br />were they millionaires?
7635839 7637340 No.
7637423 7640260 Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.
7640343 7643763 And I'm positive<br />that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...
7643847 7646266 - Ginny.<br />- Ginny were here...
7646349 7650603 they would furnish you<br />with a whole bedroom set...
7650687 7653857 which your Uncle Marsellus<br />is more than happy to do.
7657819 7661739 I like oak myself.<br />That's what I have in my bedroom.
7662866 7664826 How about you, Jimmie?
7666035 7667996 You an oak man?
7669080 7671040 Oak's nice.
7676880 7680717 Oh, man, I will never<br />forgive your ass for this shit.
7680800 7683219 This is some fucked-up, repugnant shit.
7683303 7686723 Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy<br />that once a man admits that he is wrong...
7686806 7689726 that he is immediately forgiven<br />for all wrongdoings?
7689809 7692228 Get the fuck out my face with that shit!
7692312 7695148 The motherfucker that said that shit never<br />had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...
7695231 7696649 on account of your dumb ass.
7696733 7699485 I got a threshold, Jules,<br />for the abuse that I will take.
7699569 7702822 Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,<br />and you got me in the red.
7702906 7706659 I'm just ea yin' it's fuckin' dangerous<br />to have a race car in the fuckin' red.
7706743 7708661 That's all. I could blow.
7708745 7710663 - Oh, you ready to blow?<br />- Yeah.
7710747 7713666 Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'<br />motherfucker, motherfucker.
7713750 7716669 Every time my fingers touch brain,<br />I'm Superfly TNT.
7716753 7718671 I'm the Guns of the Navarone.
7718755 7721174 In fact, what the fuck<br />am I doin' in the back?
7721257 7725011 You're the motherfucker should be on brain<br />detail! We're fuckin' switchin'!
7725094 7727555 I'm washin' windows,<br />you're pickin' up this nigger's skull!
7737273 7739234 Fine job, gentlemen.
7740568 7742487 You may get out of this yet.
7742570 7744989 I can't believe this is the same car.
7745073 7748701 Well, let's not start suckin'<br />each other's dicks quite yet.
7748785 7752330 Phase one is complete— clean the car—<br />which moves us right along to phase two:
7752413 7754499 clean you two.
7756084 7757961 Strip.
7758044 7760755 - All the way?<br />- To your bare ass.
7761881 7764926 Quickly, gentlemen.<br />We got about 15 minutes...
7765009 7767929 before Jimmie's better half<br />comes pulling into the driveway.
7768012 7770515 Goddamn, this morning air<br />is some chilly shit.
7770598 7772517 Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
7772600 7775019 - You know what you two look like?<br />- What?
7775103 7777438 Like a couple of guys<br />who just blew off somebody's head.
7778606 7781985 Strippin' off those bloody rags<br />is absolutely necessary.
7786281 7788116 Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.
7788199 7793246 Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit<br />out front for the garbageman to pick up.
7793329 7797542 Don't worry,<br />we're taking it with us. Jim, the soap.
7799002 7800920 - Vincent.<br />- Okay, gentlemen.
7801004 7804507 You both been to county before,<br />I'm sure. Here it comes.
7804590 7807468 - Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!<br />- Yo! Yo! Yo!
7807552 7810763 Better you than me, gentlemen.
7810847 7813766 Don't be afraid of the soap.<br />Spread it around.
7813850 7816728 - Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's hair.<br />- Hey, get out of my hair!
7816811 7819689 Come on, do it, goddamn it! Do it!
7820773 7822191 Towel.
7833202 7836372 You're dry enough. Toss 'em their clothes.
7837957 7839751 Perfect.
7839834 7842253 Perfect. We couldn't have<br />planned this better.
7843338 7845256 You guys look like—
7845340 7847759 What do they look like, Jimmie?
7847842 7851554 Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.
7852513 7855016 Ha-ha-ha. They're your clothes,<br />motherfucker.
7855099 7857810 Come on, gentlemen.<br />We're laughing our way right into prison.
7857894 7859854 Don't make me beg.
7862899 7866319 Okay, gentlemen,<br />let's get our rules of the road straight.
7866402 7868905 We're going to a place<br />called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.
7869530 7872950 Now, Monster Joe and his daughter<br />Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma.
7873034 7874911 The place is North Hollywood...
7874994 7878998 so a few twists and turns aside,<br />we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.
7879082 7882418 Now, I'll drive the tainted car.<br />Jules, you ride with me.
7883795 7885755 Vincent, you follow in my Acura.
7885838 7889717 Now, if we come across the path<br />of any John Q. Laws...
7889801 7892929 - nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something.<br />- Right.
7893012 7895890 - What did I say?<br />- Don't do shit unless.
7895973 7898267 - Unless what?<br />- Unless you do it first.
7898351 7900728 Spoken like a true prodigy.
7900812 7904232 How about you, Lash La Rue? Can you keep<br />your spurs from jingling and jangling?
7904315 7908444 The gun went off.<br />I don't know why. I'm cool, I promise you.
7908528 7911447 Fair enough. Now, I drive real<br />fuckin' fast, so keep up.
7911531 7914033 If I get my car back any<br />different than I gave it...
7914117 7916994 Monster Joe's gonna be<br />disposing of two bodies.
7920873 7922583 Outta my way, Rex.
7924127 7926546 - We cool?<br />- Like it never happened.
7926629 7930383 - All right.<br />- Boys, this is Raquel.
7930466 7933094 Someday all this will be hers.
7933177 7936013 Hi. So, what's with the outfits?
7936097 7938474 You guys going to a volleyball game<br />or something?
7940643 7942562 I'm takin' milady out to breakfast.
7942645 7944856 Maybe I could drop you two off.<br />Where do you live?
7944939 7946315 - Redondo.<br />- Inglewood.
7946399 7949819 It's your future.
7949902 7952655 I see a cab ride.
7952738 7955700 Move outta the sticks, fellas.<br />Say good night, Raquel.
7955783 7958703 - Good night, Raquel.<br />- I'll see you guys around.
7958786 7960413 Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.
7960496 7964208 Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was<br />a real pleasure watching you work.
7964292 7966961 Yeah, really. And thank<br />you very much, Mr. Wolf.
7968296 7970214 Call me Winston.
7971799 7974719 You see that, young lady? Respect.
7974802 7978973 - Respect for one's elders shows character.<br />- I have character.
7979056 7983060 Because you are a character doesn't<br />mean that you have character.
7990651 7992612 Wanna share a cab?
7992695 7996949 I'd go for some breakfast.<br />Feel like havin' breakfast with me?
7997033 7998326 Cool.
8003831 8006959 I don't know why, I just thought<br />he'd be European or something.
8007043 8009128 Yeah, he's about as European<br />as fuckin' English Bob.
8009212 8011464 - I know that now.<br />- But was he cool or what?
8011547 8015468 - Thank you.<br />- Totally fuckin' cool, in control.
8015551 8019597 Didn't even really get pissed when you<br />were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.
8020681 8022266 Want some bacon?
8022350 8025102 - No, man, I don't eat pork.<br />- Are you Jewish?
8025186 8027772 I ain't Jewish; I just don't<br />dig on swine, that's all.
8027855 8030775 - Why not?<br />- Pigs are filthy animals.
8030858 8032777 I don't eat filthy animals.
8032860 8036280 Yeah, but bacon tastes good.<br />Pork chops taste good.
8036364 8039283 Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,<br />but I'd never know...
8039367 8041118 'cause I wouldn't eat<br />the filthy motherfuckers.
8042370 8045289 Pigs sleep and root in shit.<br />That's a filthy animal.
8045373 8049043 I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense<br />enough to disregard its own feces.
8049126 8051671 How about a dog?<br />Dog eats its own feces.
8051754 8053673 I don't eat dog either.
8053756 8057093 Yeah, but do you consider<br />a dog to be a filthy animal?
8057176 8059804 I wouldn't go so far<br />as to calla dog filthy...
8059887 8061681 but they're definitely dirty.
8061764 8064725 But a dog's got personality.<br />Personality goes a long way.
8064809 8066310 So, by that rationale...
8066394 8070731 if a pig had a better personality, he would<br />cease to be a filthy animal, is that true?
8070815 8073943 We'd have to be talkin' about<br />one charming motherfuckin' pig.
8074026 8078072 I mean, he'd have to be 10 times more<br />charming than that Arnold on <i>Green Acres.</i>
8083661 8085788 Oh, man, that's good.
8085871 8089458 That's good, man.<br />You're startin' to lighten up.
8089542 8091961 You've been sittin' there,<br />all serious and shit.
8092044 8095006 - I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.<br />- About what?
8095089 8096549 About the miracle we witnessed.
8096632 8099927 Miracle you witnessed.<br />I witnessed a freak occurrence.
8100011 8101345 What is a miracle, Vincent?
8103306 8106475 - Act of God.<br />- And what's an act of God?
8109979 8113816 When God makes<br />the impossible possible.
8114817 8116736 But this morning...
8116819 8119530 - I don't think qualifies.<br />- Hey, Vincent.
8119614 8123326 See, that shit don't matter.<br />You're judging this shit the wrong way.
8123409 8128331 It could be God stopped the bullets,<br />changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.
8128414 8131375 You don't judge shit<br />like this based on merit.
8131459 8133919 Now, whether or not what we experienced...
8134003 8137131 was an According-to-Hoyle<br />miracle is insignificant.
8137214 8140968 But what is significant is,<br />I felt the touch of God.
8141052 8142970 God got involved.
8143054 8144764 But why?
8144847 8147892 Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:<br />I don't know why.
8147975 8150936 - But I can't go back to sleep.<br />- You're serious.
8151020 8152897 You're really thinkin' about quittin'.
8152980 8155650 - For life? Most definitely.<br />- Yeah.
8155733 8159070 Fuck. What you gonna do then?
8160404 8164617 Well, that's what I been<br />sitting here contemplating.
8164700 8168287 First I'm gonna deliver<br />this case to Marsellus.
8168371 8171457 Then, basically, I'm just<br />gonna walk the earth.
8171540 8174960 - What you mean, “Walk the earth”?<br />- Like Caine in <i>Kung Fu</i>.
8175044 8178005 Walk from place to place,<br />meet people, get in adventures.
8178089 8180341 And how long do you intend<br />to walk the earth?
8180424 8183719 - 'Til God puts me where he wants me to be.<br />- What if he don't do that?
8183803 8186180 If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever.
8186263 8188724 So you decided to be a bum.
8188808 8192436 I'll just be Jules, Vincent.<br />No more, no less.
8192520 8194480 No, Jules, you decided to be a bum...
8194563 8197858 just like all those pieces of shit out<br />there who beg for change...
8197942 8200861 who sleep in garbage bins,<br />eat what I throw away.
8200945 8203906 They got a name for that, Jules—<br />It's called a bum.
8203989 8207660 And without a job, a residence or legal<br />tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.
8207743 8209620 You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.
8209704 8212623 Look, my friend,<br />this is just where you and I differ.
8212707 8215543 Garcon! Coffee!
8215626 8220131 Jules, look, what happened this morning,<br />man, I agree it was peculiar.
8220214 8223300 - But water into wine, I—<br />- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.
8223384 8226512 - Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.<br />- If my answers frighten you...
8226595 8229140 then you should cease<br />asking scary questions.
8232059 8233978 I'm gonna take a shit.
8237857 8239400 Let me ask you something.
8239483 8242862 When did you make this decision, when you<br />were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?
8242945 8246866 Yeah. I was sittin' here eatin' my muffin,<br />drinkin' my coffee...
8246949 8248868 replayin' the incident in my head...
8248951 8252788 when I had what alcoholics refer to<br />as a moment of clarity.
8253414 8255958 Fuck. To be continued.
8267970 8270931 - I love you, pumpkin.<br />- I love you, honey bunny.
8272516 8274602 Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!
8274685 8277313 Any one of you fucking pricks move...
8277396 8280524 and I'll execute every one<br />of you motherfuckers!
8280608 8283986 You got that?<br />You just be quiet over there!
8284069 8287114 Get on the fuckin'— get the fuck down!
8287198 8291911 You're in a blind spot. Take your dames<br />over to that booth, on the count of ten!
8291994 8296540 - Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!<br />- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8—
8296624 8299710 What the fuck are you doing,<br />you fucking yuppie? Get down!
8299794 8302254 - Get down!<br />- Th row those bags!

8304924 8307176 Move! Get the fuck—
8307259 8310262 Get down on the fucking floor!
8310346 8312264 Grandpa! Down!
8312348 8315726 I'm the manager here,<br />and there's no problem. No problem at all.
8315810 8318729 - You gonna give me a problem?<br />- No, sir, I'm not.
8318813 8322817 Thought you said you were gonna give me<br />a fucking problem!
8322900 8327571 - I think we got a hero here, honey bunny.<br />- Well, just execute him!
8328197 8329949 I am not a hero.
8330032 8332701 - I'm just a coffee shop manager.<br />- Get the fuck down!
8332785 8334537 The restaurant's ours!
8334620 8337540 Just take whatever you want.
8337623 8339542 - You talk to the customers.<br />- Yeah.
8339625 8342753 You tell them to be fucking cool<br />and everything will be over.
8342837 8344797 - You understand me?<br />- Yes!
8347091 8350970 Listen, everybody. Be calm, cooperate...
8351053 8353973 and this'll all be over in a minute!
8354056 8356058 Get the fuck down! Well done.
8368362 8371824 All right, now, people, gonna come around<br />and collect your wallets!
8371907 8375327 You don't fucking talk, you just throw 'em<br />in the bag! Are we clear?
8375411 8377663 I said, are we fucking clear?
8377746 8379623 Good! Now, wallets out!
8381333 8384336 That's it.<br />Get the fuck down. In the bag.
8384420 8387339 - In the fucking bag!<br />- I don't have nothin' on me, man.
8387423 8389258 In the bag.
8390050 8392261 What am I waiting for? In the fucking bag.
8392344 8395264 Laura. Laura. Tips. In the bag.
8396098 8397558 - Is that a cellular phone?<br />- Yeah.
8397641 8399184 In the fucking bag.
8401145 8404607 Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.<br />Now get the fuck down on the floor.
8404690 8407109 In the bag. In the bag.
8419288 8421248 In the bag.
8436347 8439266 - What's in the case?<br />- My boss' dirty laundry.
8439350 8441894 - Your boss makes you do his laundry?<br />- When he wants it clean.
8441977 8444647 - Sounds like a shit job.<br />- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.
8444730 8447650 - Open it.<br />- 'Fraid I can't do that.
8449693 8452029 - I didn't hear you.<br />- Yes, you did.
8453155 8455449 What's going on?
8455532 8457409 Looks like we got<br />a vigilante in our midst.
8457493 8458994 Shoot him in the face!
8459078 8462790 I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't<br />the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.
8462873 8465250 If you don't take your hand off<br />that case, it'll be your last.
8465334 8466585 Stop causing problems!
8466669 8469129 You'll get us all killed! Give 'em what<br />you got and get 'em outta here!
8469213 8473425 Shut the fuck up, fat man!<br />This ain't none of your goddamn business!
8473509 8475761 Be cool, honey bunny, be cool.
8475844 8477888 No problem. I got it under control.
8479515 8481517 Now, I'm gonna count to three.
8483102 8487022 If you don't open that case,<br />I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.
8491443 8492861 We clear?
8496532 8498450 One.
8500285 8502788 Two.
8502871 8504915 - Three.<br />- Okay, Ringo.
8504999 8507084 You win.
8507167 8509086 It's yours.
8514133 8515884 Open it.
8519722 8521932 Hey, what is it?
8522016 8524351 What is it?
8524435 8527062 Is that what I think it is?
8531400 8533485 It's beautiful.
8533569 8536113 Goddamn it, what is it?
8537614 8540534 You let him go! You let him go!
8540617 8543579 - Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!<br />- Tell that bitch to be cool.
8543662 8546582 - Say, “Bitch, be cool!” Say, “Bitch, be cool!”<br />- Be cool! Be cool!
8546665 8549376 - Tell that bitch to chill!<br />- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!
8549460 8552337 - Chill that fuckin' bitch out!<br />- Chill out, honey bunny!
8552421 8554214 - Let go of him!<br />- Chill out, honey bunny!
8554298 8557217 - Now, promise her it's gonna be all right!<br />- I promise!
8557301 8559178 - Tell her to chill!<br />- Chill out, honey bunny!
8559261 8561180 - Now tell me her name.<br />- Yolanda.
8561263 8564683 All right, now, Yolanda, we're not gonna<br />do anything stupid, are we?
8564767 8567686 - Don't you hurt him!<br />- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!
8567770 8571273 We're all gonna be like three little<br />Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?
8571356 8575027 - Come on, Yolanda! What's Fonzie like?<br />- He's cool.
8575110 8576987 - What?<br />- Cool.
8577071 8579907 Correctamundo.<br />And that's what we're gonna be.
8579990 8581909 We're gonna be cool.
8581992 8586872 Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three.
8586955 8589041 And when I count three...
8589124 8592044 I want you to let go of your gun...
8592127 8595631 put your palms flat on the table<br />and sit your ass down.
8596673 8598717 And when you do it...
8598801 8600886 you do it cool.
8600969 8603263 You ready?
8603347 8605432 One...
8605516 8607726 two...
8607810 8609728 three.
8616693 8619822 - Okay, now you let him go!<br />- Yolanda!
8619905 8623492 I thought you were gonna be cool. Now,<br />when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.
8623575 8625661 When I get nervous, I get scared.
8625744 8629540 When motherfuckers get scared, that's when<br />motherfuckers accidentally get shot.
8631208 8634837 Just know, you hurt him, you die.
8634920 8638298 Well, that seems to be the situation.
8638382 8640300 But I don't want that.
8640384 8642302 And you don't want that.
8642386 8645097 And Ringo here definitely<br />doesn't want that.
8645180 8647307 So let's see what we can do.
8649101 8652938 Now... here's the situation.
8653021 8656859 Normally both your asses<br />would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken...
8656942 8659862 but you happened to pull this shit<br />while I'm in a transitional period...
8659945 8662364 and I don't wanna kill you;<br />I wanna help you.
8662447 8667202 But I can't give you this case,<br />'cause it don't belong to me.
8667286 8670372 Besides, I been through too much shit<br />over this case this morning...
8670455 8673375 to just hand it over to your dumb ass.
8673458 8675294 Vincent!
8675377 8678297 - Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.<br />- Get back!
8678380 8681091 It's cool! We still just talkin'.
8681175 8684595 Come on. Point the gun at me.<br />Point the gun at me.
8684678 8687472 There you go.<br />Now, Vincent, you just hang back...
8687556 8689474 and don't do a goddamn thing.
8689558 8691476 Tell her it's still cool.
8691560 8694438 - It's still cool, honey bunny.<br />- How we doin', baby?
8695898 8698525 I gotta go pee.
8698609 8700527 I wanna go home.
8700611 8704198 Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.<br />And Ringo's proud of you.
8704281 8707201 It's almost over.<br />Tell her you're proud of her.
8707284 8710621 - I'm proud of you, honey bunny.<br />- I love you.
8710704 8712581 I love you too, honey bunny.
8712664 8717920 Now, I want you to go<br />in that bag and find my wallet.
8720422 8723967 - Which one is it?<br />- It's the one that says bad motherfucker.
8738649 8742027 That's it. That's my bad motherfucker.
8742110 8744404 Open it up. Take out the money.
8749952 8751620 Count it.
8757918 8760462 How much is there?
8762339 8764258 About 1,500 dollars.
8764341 8767511 Okay, put it in your pocket. It's yours.
8767594 8770806 Now, with the rest of those wallets<br />and the register...
8770889 8772975 that makes this a pretty successful<br />little score, huh?
8773058 8775185 Jules, you give that<br />fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars...
8775269 8776937 and I'll shoot him<br />on general principle.
8777020 8779940 No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna<br />do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!
8780023 8782609 Vince, shut the fuck up!
8782693 8786571 - Shut up!<br />- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.
8786655 8789574 Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent.
8789658 8791535 I'm bu yin' something for my money.
8792828 8795998 - Wanna know what I'm bu yin', Ringo?<br />- What?
8796081 8800794 Your life. I'm givin' you that money<br />so I don't have to kill your ass.
8800877 8803547 You read the Bible, Ringo?
8804673 8806591 Not regularly, no.
8806675 8809052 Well, there's this passage<br />I got memorized.
8809136 8812681 Ezekiel 25:17.
8812764 8816018 “The path of the righteous man<br />is beset on all sides...
8816101 8819563 by the inequities of the selfish<br />and the tyranny of evil men.
8819646 8823025 Blessed is he who, in the name of charity<br />and good will...
8823108 8825527 shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness...
8825610 8829698 for he is truly his brother's keeper<br />and the finder of lost children.
8829781 8834077 And I will strike down upon thee with<br />great vengeance and furious anger...
8834161 8837205 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy my brothers.
8837289 8840292 And you will know I am the Lord...
8840375 8843045 when I lay my vengeance upon you.”
8845047 8847466 I been ea yin' that shit for years...
8847549 8850677 and if you heard it, that meant your ass.
8850761 8853680 I never gave much thought<br />to what it meant.
8853764 8856683 I just thought it was some coldblooded<br />shit to say to a motherfucker...
8856767 8859186 before I popped a cap in his ass.
8859269 8861688 But I saw some shit this morning<br />made me think twice.
8862773 8865692 See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means...
8865776 8870655 you're the evil man,<br />and I'm the righteous man...
8870739 8873658 and Mr. 9-millimeter here,<br />he's the shepherd...
8873742 8877287 protecting my righteous ass<br />in the Valley of Darkness.
8877371 8879289 Or it could mean...
8879373 8882793 you're the righteous man,<br />and I'm the shepherd...
8882876 8886797 and it's the world<br />that's evil and selfish.
8886880 8889132 Yeah, I'd like that.
8889216 8892094 But that shit ain't the truth.
8892177 8894054 The truth is...
8895097 8897766 you're the weak...
8898433 8901812 and I'm the tyranny of evil men.
8903271 8905190 But I'm tryin', Ringo.
8906441 8911113 I'm tryin' real hard<br />to be the shepherd.
8927045 8928964 Go.
8947149 8949109 I think we should be leaving now.
8949860 8951611 Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
