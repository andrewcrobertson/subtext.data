28340 32428 Forget it. It's too risky.<br />I'm through doing that shit.
32508 35966 You always say that.<br />The same thing every time.
36038 37977 "I’m through, never again,<br />too dangerous."
38048 40537 I know that's what I always say.<br />I'm always right too.
40617 44015 - You forget about it in a day or two.<br />- The days of me forgetting are over.
44087 46176 The days of me remembering<br />have just begun.
46248 48417 You know, when you go on like this,<br />what you sound like ?
48488 51516 - I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.<br />- You sound like a duck.
51588 55046 - Quack, quack, quack.<br />- Take heart, 'cause you're never<br />gonna have to hear it again.
55127 58615 Since I'm never gonna<br />do it again, you're never<br />gonna have to hear me quack.
58696 63425 - After tonight ?<br />- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
63506 66335 - Can I get anyone more coffee ?<br />- Oh, yes !
68136 70695 - Thank you.<br />- You're welcome.
70776 73864 I mean, the way it is now,
73946 76745 you're takin' the same risk<br />as when you rob a bank.
76815 78874 Takin' more of a risk.<br />Banks are easier.
78945 81973 Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you<br />in any way during a robbery.
82056 86284 They're insured. Why should<br />they give a fuck ? I don't even<br />need a gun in a Federal bank.
86356 89814 Heard about this one bloke, he walks<br />into a bank with a portable phone.
89895 92864 He gives the phone to a teller.<br />The bloke on the other end says,
92925 96493 "We got this guy's little girl.<br />If you don't give him all your<br />money, we're gonna kill her."
96565 99364 - Did it work ?<br />- Fuckin' right it worked.<br />That's what I'm talkin' about.
99434 105273 Knucklehead walks into a bank<br />with a telephone. Not a pistol,<br />not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.
105345 109974 - Cleans the place out.<br />They don't lift a fuckin' finger.<br />- Did they hurt the little girl ?
110044 113742 There probably never was<br />a little girl. The point of<br />the story isn't a little girl.
113814 116802 The point of the story is they<br />robbed a bank with a telephone.
116883 119852 - You want to rob banks ?<br />- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.
119924 122353 I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be<br />easier than what we've been doing.
122424 126582 -No more liquor stores?<br />-What've we been talkin' about?<br />Yeah, no more liquor stores.
126663 129632 Besides, it ain't the giggle<br />it used to be. There's too many<br />foreigners own liquor stores.
129692 131631 Vietnamese, Koreans,<br />don't even speak fuckin' English.
131703 134062 You tell 'em empty out<br />the register, they don't know<br />what you're talkin' about.
134132 136071 They make it too personal.
136133 140371 - We keep on, one of these gook<br />fuckers gonna make us kill him.<br />- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
140443 144741 I don't want to either.<br />But they'll probably put us<br />in a situation where it's us or them.
144812 146741 And if it's not the gooks,
146812 149441 it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned<br />the store for 15 fucking generations.
149512 153950 You got Grandpa lrving sitting<br />behind the counter with<br />a fucking Magnum in his hand.
154022 155951 Try walkin' into one of those places<br />with nothing but a phone.
156022 157961 See how far that gets you.<br />Forget it.
158022 160961 - We're out of it.<br />- Well, what then, day jobs ?
161031 163050 - Not in this life.<br />- What then ?
165230 167429 GarÃ§on, coffee !
167501 169800 This place.
171271 174359 GarÃ§on means boy.
177610 180269 This place ?<br />A coffee shop ?
180350 183309 What's wrong with that ?
183379 187037 Nobody ever robs restaurants.<br />Why not ?
188019 190448 Bars, liquor stores,
190520 194248 gas stations; you get your head<br />blown off stickin' up one of them.
194330 197988 Restaurants, on the other hand,<br />you catch with their pants down.
198059 201757 They're not expectin' to get robbed.<br />Not as expectin' anyway.
201828 206327 - I bet you could cut down on the<br />hero factor in a place like this.<br />- Correct.
206398 209666 Same as banks,<br />these places are insured.
209738 212107 Manager.<br />He don't give a fuck.
212179 215008 They're just trying to get you out<br />before you start pluggin' the diners.
215078 219036 Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it.<br />No way they're takin' a bullet<br />for the register.
219117 222046 Busboys. Some wetback gettin'<br />paid $1.50 an hour...
222117 224646 really give a fuck<br />you're stealin' from the owner ?
224718 227816 Customers sittin' there<br />with food in their mouths,<br />they don't know what's goin' on.
227887 232556 One minute, they're havin'<br />a Denver omelet, the next, someone<br />is stickin' a gun in their face.
232627 237686 See, I got the idea the last<br />liquor store we stuck up, remember ?
237766 240465 - All the customers kept comin' in.<br />- Yeah.
240536 244364 You got the idea<br />of takin' their wallets.<br />Now, that was a good idea.
244437 247835 - Thank you.<br />- Made more from the wallets<br />than we did from the register.
247907 250206 - Yes, we did.<br />- A lot of people come to restaurants.
250276 253934 - A lot of wallets.<br />- Pretty smart, huh ?
254016 256035 Pretty smart.
257585 260613 I'm ready. Let's do it.<br />Right now, right here.
260686 265185 - Come on.<br />- All right. Same as<br />last time, remember ?
265256 268025 You're crowd control.<br />I'll handle the employees.
273604 276373 - I love you, Pumpkin.<br />- I love you, Honey Bunny.
277574 280073 Everybody be cool !<br />This is a robbery !
280145 283014 Any of you fucking pricks move,
283085 286983 and I'll execute<br />every motherfuckin' last one of you.
286984 287313 and I'll execute<br />every motherfuckin' last one of you.
398497 400726 -  Jungle boogie<br />-  Get down with the boogie
400797 402956 -  Jungle boogie<br />-  Get it on
403028 405227 -  Jungle boogie<br />-  Get down with the boogie
405298 407527 -  Jungle boogie<br />-  Get it on
407598 409867 -  Jungle boogie<br />-  Get up with the boogie
409937 411996 -  Jungle boogie<br />-  Get up with the get down
412077 414366 -  Jungle boogie<br />-  Get down and boogie
414437 417605 -  Jungle boogie<br />-  Shake it around
424366 428464 - Okay, so tell me again<br />about the hash bars.<br />- Okay, what you want to know ?
428536 431375 - Hash is legal there, right ?<br />- It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.
431446 436075 You just can't walk into a restaurant,<br />roll a joint and start puffin' away.
436145 439473 I mean, they want you to smoke in<br />your home or certain designated places.
439546 442215 - Those are hash bars ?<br />- Yeah. It breaks down like this.
442285 444614 It's legal to buy it.<br />It's legal to own it.
444685 447883 And if you're the proprietor<br />of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
447955 452353 It's illegal to carry it,<br />but-but that doesn't matter,<br />'cause get a load of this.
452425 456883 If you get stopped by a cop<br />in Amsterdam, it's illegal<br />for them to search you.
456965 460903 - I mean, that's a right the cops<br />in Amsterdam don't have.<br />- Oh, man ! I'm goin'.
460964 463493 That's all there is to it.<br />I'm fuckin' goin'.
463574 466503 I know, baby.<br />You'd dig it the most.
466574 469303 - But you know what the funniest thing<br />about Europe is ?<br />- What ?
469373 473311 It's the little differences.<br />I mean, they got the same shit<br />over there that they got here,
473383 476941 - but it's just there,<br />it's a little different.<br />- Example.
477014 480142 You can walk into a movie theater<br />in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
480224 483852 And I don't mean just like no paper cup.<br />I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.
483923 487751 And in Paris, you can buy<br />a beer in McDonald's.<br />You know what they call...
487823 491321 a Quarter-Pounder<br />with Cheese in Paris ?
491402 493591 They don't call it<br />a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese ?
493663 496462 They got the metric system.<br />They wouldn't know what the fuck<br />a Quarter-Pounder is.
496532 500440 - What do they call it ?<br />- They call it a Royale with Cheese.
500502 501971 - Royale with Cheese.<br />- That's right.
502042 503971 What do they call a Big Mac ?
504042 507340 Big Mac's a Big Mac,<br />but they call it Le Big Mac.
507411 510539 Le Big Mac.
510612 514780 - What do they call a Whopper ?<br />- I don't know. I didn't<br />go into Burger King.
514852 518290 - You know what they put on French fries<br />in Holland instead of ketchup ?<br />- What ?
518361 521349 - Mayonnaise.<br />- Goddamn !
521431 525729 - I seen 'em do it, man.<br />They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.<br />- Yuck.
528401 531699 We should have shotguns<br />for this kind of deal.
534670 537439 - How many up there ?<br />- Three or four.
537510 541098 - That's countin' our guy?<br />- Not sure.
541179 544577 - So that means that it could be<br />up to five guys up there ?<br />- It's possible.
544649 547008 We should have<br />fuckin' shotguns.
547080 549749 - What's her name ?<br />- Mia.
549819 554017 - Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?<br />- I don't know.
554089 557687 However people meet people.<br />She used to be a actress.
557758 560247 Oh, really ?<br />She do anything I'd have seen ?
560329 564767 - I think her biggest deal<br />was she starred in a pilot.<br />- Pilot ? What's a pilot ?
564839 568357 - Well, you know the shows on TV ?<br />- I don't watch TV.
568439 572067 Yeah, but you are aware that there<br />is an invention called television,
572138 575236 - and on this invention<br />they show shows, right ?<br />- Yeah.
575308 579716 The way they pick TV shows is they make<br />one show. That show's called a pilot.
579777 582716 Then they show that one show<br />to the people who pick shows...
582788 585717 and on the strength of that<br />one show, they decide if<br />they wanna make more shows.
585787 590316 Some get chosen and<br />become television programs.<br />Some don't, become nothin'.
590387 593585 She starred in one of the ones<br />that became nothing.
593656 596425 You remember<br />Antwan Rockamora?
596496 600324 Half-black, half-Samoan.<br />Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror."
600397 603795 - Yeah, maybe. Fat, right ?<br />- I wouldn't go so far as to<br />call the brother fat.
603867 606706 I mean, he got a weight problem.<br />What's a nigger gonna do ? He's Samoan.
606776 611204 - I think I know who you mean.<br />What about him ?<br />- Marsellus fucked him up good.
611275 615503 Word 'round the campfire is<br />it was on account of<br />Marsellus Wallace's wife.
623655 627683 - So what he'd do ? Fuck her ?<br />- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.
627755 631453 - Well, then what then ?<br />- He gave her a foot massage.
633694 635963 A foot massage ?
636035 638094 - That's it ?<br />- Mm-hmm.
638174 640103 Then what'd Marsellus do ?
640175 643333 Sent a couple cats over to his place.<br />They took him out on his patio.
643404 647342 Threw his ass over the balcony.<br />Nigger fell four stories.
647413 651471 He had a little garden down<br />at the bottom enclosed in glass,<br />like a greenhouse.
651553 653812 Nigger fell through that.
653884 656823 Since then, he kind of<br />developed a speech impediment.
658294 661023 - That's a damn shame.<br />- Hmm.
665732 669530 - But still, you play<br />with matches, you get burned.<br />- What do you mean ?
669602 673760 You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's<br />new bride a foot massage.
673832 676301 You don't think he overreacted ?
676373 681242 Antwan didn't expect Marsellus<br />to react the way he did,<br />but he had to expect a reaction.
681312 685470 It was a foot massage.<br />A foot massage is nothin'.<br />I give my mother a foot massage.
685551 689069 It's laying your hands in a familiar way<br />on Marsellus's new wife.
689152 694051 I mean, is it as bad as eatin'<br />her pussy out? No, but it's<br />the same fuckin' ballpark.
694122 696211 Whoa, stop right there.<br />Eatin' the bitch out...
696291 698880 and givin' the bitch a foot massage<br />ain't even the same fucking thing.
698961 702899 - It's not. It's the same ballpark.<br />- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.
702961 705900 Now, look, maybe your method<br />of massage differs from mine.
705970 709728 But touchin' his wife's feet<br />and sticking your tongue<br />in the holiest of holies...
709800 714068 ain't the same fuckin' ballpark;<br />it ain't the same league;<br />it ain't the same fuckin' sport.
714140 718008 - Foot massages don't mean shit !<br />- Have you ever given a foot massage ?
718080 721168 Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.
721249 723908 - I'm the foot fuckin' master.<br />- You given a lot of them ?
723979 728217 Shit, yeah!<br />Got my technique down and everything.<br />I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.
728289 730948 Would you give a guy<br />a foot massage ?
732359 735058 - Fuck you.
735129 738217 - You give 'em a lot ?<br />- Fuck you.
738299 741557 - You know, I'm kind of tired.<br />I could use a foot massage.<br />- Yo, yo, yo, man.
741638 744826 You best back off.<br />I'm gettin' a little pissed here.
745908 748467 - This is the door.<br />- Yeah, it is.
751238 753867 What time you got ?
753947 756066 7:22 in the a.m.
756148 759706 No, it ain't quite time yet.<br />Come on. Let's hang back.
767287 771055 Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man<br />a foot massage don't make it right...
771127 774325 for Marsellus to throw<br />Antwan off a building into<br />a glass motherfuckin' house,
774397 777126 fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;<br />that shit ain't right.
777196 781434 Motherfucker do that shit to me,<br />he better paralyze my ass,<br />'cause I kill the motherfucker.
781506 786465 I ain't sayin' it's right,<br />but you sayin' a massage don't mean<br />nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.
786546 791175 Now, look, I've given a million<br />ladies a million foot massages,<br />and they all meant somethin'.
791246 794974 We act like they don't,<br />but they do. That's what's<br />so fuckin' cool about them.
795055 797144 There's a sensuous thing goin' on...
797216 800444 where you don't talk about it,<br />but you know it and she knows it.
800526 805585 Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan<br />should've fuckin' better known better.
805665 810063 That's his fuckin' wife, man.<br />This ain't a man with a sense<br />of humor about this shit.
810135 812924 You know what I'm sayin' ?
813004 814933 It's an interestin' point.
815005 816934 Come on.<br />Let's get into character.
823914 825883 - What's her name again ?<br />- Mia.
825943 828971 - Mia.<br />- Why you so interested<br />in big man's wife ?
829053 834282 He's goin' out of town, Florida.<br />And he asked me if I'd take care<br />of her while he's gone.
834353 838311 - Take care of her ?<br />- No, man. Just take her out.
838393 841761 Show her a good time.<br />Make sure she don't get lonely.
841833 844352 You're gonna be takin'<br />Mia Wallace out on a date ?
844432 847061 It is not a date.
847132 851230 It's just like if you were<br />gonna take your buddy's wife<br />to a movie or somethin'.
851303 854831 - It's just good company, that's all.
858842 863611 - It's not a date.<br />It's definitely not a date.
869951 873809 Hey, kids.<br />How you boys doin'?
873881 876550 Hey, keep chillin'.
882730 885519 You know who we are ?
885601 889549 We're associates of your<br />business partner, Marsellus Wallace.
889631 892659 You do remember<br />your business partner, don't you ?
895370 898309 Now, let me take<br />a wild guess here.
900339 903367 - You're Brett, right ?<br />- Yeah.
903450 907778 I thought so. You remember<br />your business partner Marsellus Wallace,
907850 909679 don't ya, Brett ?
909749 911408 Yeah, I remember.
911489 915817 Good. Looks like me and Vincent<br />caught you boys at breakfast.
915888 918517 Sorry about that.<br />Whatcha havin'?
918588 920557 Hamburgers.
920629 924727 Hamburgers ! The cornerstone<br />of any nutritious breakfast.
926099 928398 What kind of hamburgers ?
928468 930197 - Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.<br />- No, no, no.
930268 933366 Where'd you get 'em ?<br />McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box ?
933437 936236 - Where ?<br />- Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.
936307 939435 Big Kahuna Burger !<br />That's that Hawaiian burger joint.
939518 943446 I hear they got some tasty burgers.<br />I ain't never had one myself.<br />How are they ?
943518 946217 They're-- They're good.

961597 964725 This is a tasty burger !<br />Vincent !
964806 967325 You ever had<br />a Big Kahuna burger ?
968335 970864 Want a bite ?<br />They're real tasty.
970946 974374 - I ain't hungry.<br />- Well, if you like burgers,<br />give 'em a try sometime.
974446 978274 Me, I can't usually get 'em<br />'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,
978345 981473 which pretty much makes me<br />a vegetarian.
981555 984713 But I do love the taste<br />of a good burger. Mmmm.
984785 989314 You know what they call<br />a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese<br />in France ?
989394 991453 - No.<br />- Tell 'em, Vincent.
991524 995552 - A Royale with Cheese.<br />- A Royale with Cheese.
995634 999092 You know why they call it that ?
999174 1002232 Uh, because of<br />the metric system ?
1003304 1006602 Check out the big brain<br />on Brett !
1006673 1010011 You're a smart motherfucker.<br />That's right. The metric system.
1012354 1014473 - What's in this ?<br />- Sprite.
1014554 1016483 Sprite. Good.
1016553 1020421 You mind if I have some of your<br />tasty beverage to wash this down with ?
1020493 1023352 Go right ahead.

1123817 1127215 Oh, I'm sorry,<br />did I break your concentration ?
1127287 1129886 - I didn't mean to do that. Please.
1129956 1135125 Continue. You were saying something<br />about "best intentions."
1136537 1140435 What's the matter ?<br />Oh, you were finished !
1140506 1143235 Oh, well, allow me to retort.
1146775 1149763 What does Marsellus Wallace<br />look like ?
1149845 1152034 What ?
1152115 1155373 - What country you from ?<br />- What ?
1155445 1159713 - "What" ain't no country I ever<br />heard of. They speak English in What ?<br />- W-What ?

1178504 1180833 - Go on !<br />- He's bald !
1180904 1183633 - Does he look like a bitch ?<br />- What ?
1185373 1189401 Does he look... like a bitch?
1189484 1192712 - No !<br />- Then why you tryin'<br />to fuck him like a bitch?
1192784 1196412 - I didn't.<br />- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett !
1196493 1198652 - You tried to fuck him.- No, no.
1198723 1203992 But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be<br />fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
1204062 1207120 - You read the Bible, Brett ?<br />- Yes !
1207203 1211762 Well, there's this passage<br />I got memorized. Sort of<br />fits this occasion.
1211832 1214171 Ezekiel 25:17.
1214242 1217540 "The path of the righteous man...
1217612 1221540 is beset on all sides<br />by the inequities of the selfish...
1221611 1224550 and the tyranny of evil men.
1224612 1229551 Blessed is he who,<br />in the name of charity and goodwill,
1229622 1232780 shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness,
1232861 1235520 for he is truly<br />his brother's keeper...
1235591 1239149 and the finder<br />of lost children.
1239230 1243028 And I will strike down upon thee<br />with great vengeance...
1243101 1245070 and furious anger...
1245130 1249799 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy My brothers !
1249870 1253708 And you will know<br />My name is the Lord...
1253779 1257177 when I lay My vengeance<br />upon thee !"
1275398 1278057 I think you gonna find...
1278129 1280798 when all this shit<br />is over and done--
1282469 1286837 I think you're gonna find yourself<br />one smilin' motherfucker.
1288408 1291207 The thing is, Butch,
1291278 1294306 right now...<br />you got ability.
1295988 1298417 But painful as it may be,
1298487 1301645 ability... don't last.
1303627 1307715 And your days are just about over.
1307796 1312194 Now, that's a hard<br />motherfuckin' fact of life.
1312266 1317295 But that's a fact of life your ass<br />is gonna have to get realistic about.
1319206 1324665 You see, this business is filled to<br />the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.
1324746 1328704 Motherfuckers who thought<br />their ass would age like wine.
1330415 1334143 If you mean it turns<br />to vinegar... it does.
1335386 1339654 If you mean it gets better<br />with age... it don't.
1341325 1343294 Besides, Butch,
1345025 1348653 how many fights you think<br />you got in you anyway ?
1348735 1350924 Hmm ?
1351005 1352964 Two ?
1354075 1357473 Boxers don't have<br />an old-timers' day.
1358574 1362562 You came close,<br />but you never made it.
1362644 1366842 And if you were gonna make it,<br />you would have made it before now.
1383562 1385831 You my nigger ?
1390502 1392901 Certainly appears so.
1399351 1403279 The night of the fight,<br />you may feel a slight sting.
1406421 1409789 That's pride fuckin' with you.
1410861 1413450 Fuck pride !
1415190 1418218 Pride only hurts.
1418300 1420229 It never helps.
1421671 1423690 You fight through that shit.
1425201 1430110 'Cause a year from now,<br />when you kickin' it in the Caribbean,
1430180 1435119 you gonna say to yourself,<br />"Marsellus Wallace was right."
1437089 1441357 I got no problem<br />with that, Mr. Wallace.
1441429 1445227 In the fifth,<br />your ass goes down.
1449299 1451238 Say it.
1453508 1456936 In the fifth,<br />my ass goes down.
1458878 1461397 Yo, Vincent Vega.<br />Our man in Amsterdam.
1461479 1465937 Jules Winfield, our man in lnglewood.<br />Get your asses on in here.
1466018 1469846 - Goddamn, nigger,<br />what's up with them clothes ?<br />- You don't even want to know.
1469918 1473186 Where's the big man ?
1473257 1476186 The big man's right over there<br />takin' care of some business.
1476258 1480716 Why don't you hang back a second or two.<br />You see the white boy leave, go on over.
1483437 1485696 How ya been ?
1485766 1489704 - I been doin' pretty good.<br />How 'bout yourself ?<br />- All right.
1491306 1494175 So I hear you're<br />takin' Mia out tomorrow.
1497316 1499505 At Marsellus's request.
1500786 1503345 - Have you met Mia ?<br />- Not yet.
1503415 1506613 - What's so fuckin' funny ?
1506685 1509284 - Not a goddamn thing.<br />- I got to piss.
1509356 1513624 Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot,<br />all right ? It's the big man's wife.
1513696 1516355 I'm gonna sit across from her,<br />chew my food with my mouth closed,
1516435 1518394 Laugh at her fuckin' jokes,<br />and that's it.
1518465 1521593 Hey, my name's Paul,<br />and this shit's between y'all.
1521664 1524722 Then what'd you fuckin'<br />ask me about it for ?
1524804 1527293 Asshole.
1533544 1535743 - Gimme a pack of Red Apples.<br />- Filters ?
1535814 1537753 No.
1540584 1544482 - You lookin' at somethin', friend?<br />- You ain't my friend, palooka.
1546594 1550082 -What was that ?<br />-I think you heard me just fine, punchy.
1550164 1552753 Vincent Vega's in the house ?
1552833 1556131 My nigger,<br />get your ass over here.
1563713 1566502 - What's up ?<br />- Man, I'm really sorry.
1566582 1568741 You shouldn't worry about it.
1568812 1571781 Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.
1574282 1576621 And some matches.
1579721 1581660 Thanks.
1583531 1587859 It's as if it turns every part<br />of your body into the tip of a penis.
1587931 1591829 - Whoa.<br />- I'll lend it to you.<br />It's a great book on piercing.
1591901 1596299 That gun to pierce your ears,<br />they don't use that to pierce<br />your nipples, do they ?
1596370 1600238 Forget that gun. That guns goes against<br />the entire idea behind piercing.
1600311 1605180 All my piercing, 18 places on my body,<br />every one of 'em done with a needle.
1605250 1608738 Five in each ear, one through<br />the nipple of my left breast,
1608820 1611948 two in my right nostril,<br />one in my left eyebrow,
1612020 1614889 one in my belly,<br />one in my lip, one in my clit,
1614959 1618417 - and I wear a stud in my tongue.<br />-  Excuse me.
1618490 1620429 I was just curious,
1620499 1624357 but, um... why would you wear<br />a stud in your tongue ?
1624429 1627927 Sex thing.<br />Helps fellatio.
1627999 1631957 Vincenzo.<br />Step in my office.
1638749 1641807 This is Panda from Mexico.<br />Very good stuff.
1641878 1645316 Now, that's Bava.<br />Different, but equally good.
1645388 1648317 And that is Choco<br />from the Harz Mountains of Germany.
1648388 1652826 Now, the first two are the same.<br />300 a gram. Those are friend prices.
1652888 1655857 But this one<br />is a little more expensive.
1655927 1658326 This is 500 a gram.
1658397 1661795 But, when you shoot it, you will know<br />where that extra money went.
1661867 1665965 There's nothing wrong with these two.<br />This is real, real, real good shit.
1666037 1669695 But this one<br />is a fuckin' madman.
1669777 1672536 Remember, I just got back<br />from Amsterdam.
1672607 1675635 Am I a nigger ?<br />Are we in lnglewood ? No.
1675716 1678874 You're in my home. Now, white people<br />who know the difference...
1678946 1681944 between good shit and bad shit,<br />this is the house they come to.
1682015 1685383 Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi<br />Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...
1685455 1688753 - any old day of the fuckin' week.<br />- That's a bold statement.
1688826 1692694 This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.<br />This is a seller's market.
1692766 1696754 Coke is fuckin' dead<br />as... dead.
1696835 1700703 Heroin, it's comin' back<br />in a big fuckin' way.
1701975 1705433 - All right.<br />Gimme three grams of madman.<br />- Okay.
1705505 1708943 Now, if it's as good as you say it is,<br />I'll come back and buy another thousand.
1709014 1711773 I just hope that I still<br />have some left for ya,
1711844 1716042 but I'm givin' you some<br />out of my own private stash.
1716114 1719282 That is what a nice guy I am.
1719354 1723452 - I'm outta balloons.<br />Is a baggie all right ?<br />- Yeah, that's cool.
1723524 1725513 All right.<br />I'll just get one for ya.
1725594 1730533 Honey, will you get me some baggies<br />and, uh, twistix from the kitchen ?
1730603 1732562 Okay.
1732633 1736161 Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi ?<br />She ain't got a boyfriend.
1736232 1739530 - You wanna hang out and get high ?<br />- Which one's Trudi ?
1739602 1743770 -The one with all the shit in her face ?<br />-No, that's Jody.
1743843 1746282 That's my wife.
1746343 1750942 - I'm sorry, man.<br />- Thank you.
1751022 1754880 - No, I can't. I gotta be someplace.<br />- All right, no problemo.
1754952 1757681 - I'll take a rain check.
1757761 1761089 - Oh.<br />- Thank you, Jody.
1761162 1764460 Still got your Malibu ?
1764532 1767620 Oh, man, you know what some fucker<br />did the other day ?
1767701 1769630 - What ?<br />- Fuckin' keyed it.
1769701 1773299 - Oh, man, that's fucked up.<br />- Tell me about it.
1773371 1776070 I had it in storage<br />for three years.
1776140 1780478 It was out five days, and some<br />dickless piece of shit fucked with it.
1780550 1784978 They should be fuckin' killed,<br />man. No trial, no jury,<br />straight to execution.
1785050 1789779 I wish I could've caught him<br />doin' it. I'd have given<br />anything to catch that asshole.
1789859 1794588 - It'd been worth him doin' it<br />just so I could've caught him.<br />- What a fucker !
1794660 1797459 What's more chicken-shit<br />than fuckin' with a man's automobile ?
1797530 1800429 - Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.<br />- You don't do it.
1800500 1802899 - It's just against the rules.<br />- Thank you.
1802969 1805128 Thank you.
1805199 1807998 - Mind if I shoot up here?<br />- Hey, mi casa es su casa.
1808069 1811367 Muchas gracias.

2202306 2207005 I think it's like<br />a wax museum with a pulse.
2207077 2210915 Hi, I'm Buddy.<br />What can I get you ?
2213456 2217784 Let's see, steak, steak, steak. Oh,<br />yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.
2217855 2220654 - I'll have that.<br />- How do you want that cooked ?
2220725 2224023 - Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell ?<br />- Bloody as hell, and--
2224096 2226825 Oh, yeah, look at this--<br />vanilla Coke.
2226895 2228864 What about you, Peggy Sue ?
2228935 2232263 I'll have the...
2232335 2236673 Durward Kirby burger, bloody.
2236745 2240643 And... a five-dollar shake.
2240715 2243444 How do you want that shake,<br />Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?
2243515 2247643 - Martin and Lewis.<br />- Did you just order<br />a five-dollar shake ?
2247714 2249773 Mm-hmm.
2249854 2253012 That's a shake ?<br />That's milk and ice cream ?
2253093 2257491 - Last I heard.<br />- That's five dollars ? You don't<br />put bourbon in it or nothin' ?
2257563 2259922 - No.<br />- Just checking.
2259994 2262693 I'll be right back<br />with your drinks.
2262763 2264702 To Lonesome Town
2264763 2268721 To cry my troubles away
2270343 2274401 Could you, um...<br />roll me one of those, cowboy ?
2274472 2277341 You can have this one, cowgirl.
2277413 2279342 - Thanks.
2279412 2281811 The streets are filled<br />with regret
2284082 2286111 Think nothin' of it.
2286192 2290020 Lay me down<br />in Lonesome Town
2290092 2293620 -  I can learn to forget<br />- So...
2293691 2296789 Marsellus said<br />you just got back from Amsterdam.
2296862 2299990 - Sure did.<br />- How long were you there ?
2300072 2302591 Just over three years.
2305141 2307970 I go there about once a year<br />to chill out for a month.
2308041 2311769 No kiddin'?<br />I didn't know that.
2311840 2314779 Why would you ?
2319450 2321389 I heard you did a pilot.
2322660 2326348 - That was my 15 minutes.<br />- What was it ?
2326430 2331129 It was a show about a team of female<br />secret agents called Fox Force Five.
2331200 2333929 - What ?<br />- Fox Force Five.
2333999 2336258 Fox, as in were a bunch<br />of foxy chicks.
2336339 2338798 Force, as in we're a force<br />to be reckoned with.
2338869 2341638 And five, as in there's<br />one-two-three-four-five of us.
2341709 2345397 There was a blond one,<br />Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.
2345478 2348606 The Japanese fox<br />was a kung fu master.
2348679 2352737 The black girl<br />was a demolition expert.
2352819 2355688 French fox's specialty was sex.
2355758 2360116 - What was your specialty?<br />- Knives.
2360257 2362226 The character I played,<br />Raven McCoy,
2362288 2366156 her background was she grew up<br />raised by circus performers.
2366228 2370496 According to the show,<br />she was the deadliest woman<br />in the world with a knife.
2370568 2373327 And she knew<br />a zillion old jokes.
2373397 2377525 Her grandfather,<br />an old vaudevillian, taught her.
2377606 2380904 And if we would have got picked up,<br />they would've worked in a gimmick...
2380976 2384844 where every show<br />I would've told another joke.
2386047 2388806 You know any of them old jokes ?
2388887 2392615 Well, I only got the chance to say one<br />'cause we only did one show.
2392686 2395245 - Tell me.<br />- It's corny.
2396155 2398244 Don't be that way.<br />Tell me.
2398325 2402023 - No, you wouldn't like it,<br />and I'd be embarrassed.<br />- You'd be embarr--
2402096 2406034 You told 50 million people,<br />and you can't tell me ?
2406096 2409964 - I promise I won't laugh.<br />- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.
2410035 2412364 That's not what I meant.<br />You know it.
2412435 2415873 Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you<br />'cause it's been built up too much.
2415945 2418534 What a gyp.
2419715 2422074 Martin and Lewis.
2425154 2427553 Vanilla Coke.
2431893 2435221 Mmm. Yummy.
2435293 2438262 You think I could<br />have a sip of that ?
2439794 2441963 Be my guest.
2442034 2446062 I gotta know what<br />a five-dollar shake tastes like.
2446133 2449591 - You can use my straw.<br />I don't have cooties.<br />- Yeah, but maybe I do.
2449672 2452541 Cooties I can handle.
2452612 2454581 All right.
2461652 2464451 Goddamn, that's a pretty<br />fuckin' good milkshake !
2464522 2468580 -Told ya.<br />-I don't know if it was worth $5,<br />but it's pretty fuckin' good.
2503519 2507047 - Don't you hate that ?<br />- Hate what ?
2507129 2509458 Uncomfortable silences.
2511469 2515988 Why do we feel it's necessary<br />to yak about bullshit<br />in order to be comfortable ?
2516069 2520007 I don't know.<br />That's a good question.
2520069 2524808 That's when you know<br />you found somebody really special.
2524878 2529577 When you can just shut the fuck up for<br />a minute and comfortably share silence.
2529648 2533746 Well, I don't think we're quite<br />there yet, but don't feel bad.<br />We just met each other.
2535258 2538376 I'll tell you what.
2538457 2541715 I'm gonna go to the bathroom<br />and powder my nose.
2541797 2544985 You sit here...<br />and think of something to say.
2546228 2548167 I'll do that.
2550497 2552436 Okay.
2577695 2579884 I said goddamn !
2579966 2583124 Goddamn !<br />Goddamn.
2585735 2588324 I need some hair spray.
2594175 2596164 Mmmm.
2596244 2600572 Don't you just love it when you<br />come back from the bathroom to<br />find your food waiting for you ?
2600644 2603043 We're lucky<br />we got anything at all.
2603115 2606243 I don't think Buddy Holly's<br />much of a waiter.
2606324 2609452 Maybe we should've sat<br />in Marilyn Monroe's section.
2609523 2612581 - Which one? There's two Monroes.<br />- No, there's not.
2612663 2614992 That is Marilyn Monroe.
2615063 2617792 That is Mamie Van Doren.
2617864 2622803 I don't see Jayne Mansfield,<br />so she must have the night off.
2622873 2626301 - Pretty smart.<br />- Yeah. I got my moments.
2626373 2630741 - So did you think of somethin' to say ?<br />- Actually, I did.
2632382 2634341 However...
2636053 2639071 you seem like<br />a really nice person, and l--
2639152 2641981 - I don't want to offend you.<br />- Oooh.
2642052 2647251 This doesn't sound like<br />the usual, mindless, boring,<br />gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.
2647322 2650320 This sounds like you<br />actually have somethin' to say.
2650391 2653230 Well, well, I do. I do.
2653302 2657360 -  But you have<br />to promise not to be offended.<br />- No, no.
2657441 2661669 You can't promise somethin' like that.<br />I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.
2661741 2666610 You can ask me what you're gonna<br />ask me, and my natural response<br />could be to get offended.
2666680 2669039 Then, through no fault of my own,<br />I would have broken my promise.
2669111 2671810 - Let's just forget it.<br />- That's an impossibility.
2671880 2675938 Trying to forget anything<br />as intriguing as this would be<br />an exercise in futility.
2676020 2678219 - Is that a fact ?<br />- And besides,
2678290 2683319 - isn't it more, uh, exciting<br />when you don't have permission ?<br />- All right, all right.
2683390 2686189 Well, here goes.
2686259 2689287 What did you think about<br />what happened to Antwan ?
2689370 2692798 - Who's Antwan ?<br />- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.
2692869 2696097 - He fell out of a window.<br />- Hmm. Hmm.
2696169 2700868 Well, that is one way to say it.<br />Another way to say it would be<br />that he was thrown out.
2700949 2704107 Another way would be<br />he was thrown out by Marsellus.
2704178 2709307 Yet even another way is to say<br />he was thrown out of a window<br />by Marsellus because of you.
2709389 2711818 - Is that a fact ?<br />- No.
2711888 2715016 No, it's not a fact. It's just what<br />I heard. That's just what I heard.
2715088 2717987 - Who told you ?<br />- They.
2718058 2720527 "They" talk a lot, don't they ?
2722698 2725357 They certainly do.<br />They certainly do.
2725437 2729835 - Don't be shy, Vincent.<br />What else did "they" say ?<br />- I'm-- I'm not shy.
2729907 2732426 - Um--<br />- Did it involve the "F" word?
2732507 2736495 No, no, no, no, no.<br />They just said that Antwan<br />had given you a foot massage.
2738046 2740675 - And ?<br />- And-- And nothin'.
2740747 2743616 That's it.
2743686 2745745 You heard Marsellus...
2745817 2750185 threw Tony Rocky Horror<br />out of a fourth-story window<br />for giving me a foot massage ?
2750256 2752195 - Mm-hmm.<br />- And you believe that ?
2752255 2756784 Well, at the time<br />I was told it sounded reasonable.
2756865 2759953 Marsellus throwing Tony out<br />of a fourth-story window...
2760036 2763094 for massaging my feet<br />seemed reasonable ?
2763166 2766624 No, it seemed excessive,<br />but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.
2766705 2769364 I understand that Marsellus<br />is very protective of you.
2769445 2774074 A husband being protective<br />of his wife is one thing.
2774144 2777872 A husband almost killing<br />another man for touching<br />his wife's feet is something else.
2777955 2780544 But did it happen ?
2780615 2786454 Only thing Antwan ever touched<br />of mine was my hand when he<br />shook it... at my wedding.
2786524 2788923 Really ?
2788993 2792321 Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus<br />threw Tony out that window...
2792393 2794332 except Marsellus and Tony.
2794404 2798392 When you little scamps get together,<br />you're worse than a sewing circle.
2798534 2802402 Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment<br />you've all been waiting for.
2802473 2807502 The world-famous<br />Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.
2809912 2814240 Now, this is where<br />one lucky couple...
2814323 2818781 will win this handsome trophy<br />that Marilyn here is holding.
2818852 2822410 Now, who will be<br />our first contestants ?
2822492 2824751 - Right here !<br />-  All right !
2824831 2827849 - I wanna dance.<br />- No, no, no, no, no.
2827931 2832660 No, no, no, no, no. I do believe<br />Marsellus, my husband, your boss,
2832731 2836169 told you to take me out<br />and do whatever I wanted.
2836241 2839929 Now I wanna dance;<br />I wanna win; I want that trophy.
2840011 2841220 - So dance good.<br />- All right. You asked for it.
2841221 2842550 - So dance good.<br />- All right. You asked for it.
2842620 2845589 Let's hear it<br />for our first contestants.
2850191 2855460 Now let's meet our first<br />contestants here this evening.<br />Young lady, what is your name ?
2855530 2857519 Mrs. Mia Wallace.
2857600 2860229 And how 'bout your fella here ?
2860299 2862128 Vincent Vega.
2862199 2865637 All right, let's see what you can do.<br />Take it away !
2865710 2868639 -  Go for it.<br />-  Come on !
2886928 2890886 It was a teenage wedding<br />and the old folks wished them well
2892898 2896856 You could see that Pierre<br />did truly love the mademoiselle
2898937 2903035 And now the young monsieur<br />and madame have rung the chapel bell
2905007 2909305 C'est la vie say the old folks<br />It goes to show you never can tell
2911187 2915345 They furnished off an apartment<br />with a two-room Roebucks sale
2917256 2921524 The 'coolerador was crammed<br />with TV dinners and ginger ale
2923397 2927295 But when Pierre found work<br />the little money comin'<br />worked out well
2929396 2933664 C'est la vie say the old folks<br />It goes to show you never can tell
2935375 2939743 They had a hi-fi phono<br />and boy did they let it blast
2941776 2946044 Seven hundred little records<br />all rock, rhythm and jazz
2947785 2951883 But when the sun went down<br />the rapid tempo of the music fell
2953824 2958853 C'est la vie say the old folks<br />It goes to show you never can tell
2984352 2988580 They had a teenage wedding<br />and the old folks wished them well
2990623 2994581 You could see that Pierre<br />did truly love the mademoiselle
3029800 3032988 Is that what you call<br />an uncomfortable silence ?
3033070 3036428 I don't know<br />what you call that.
3036500 3039129 - Drinks ! Music !
3040140 3042369 I'm gonna take a piss.
3042439 3047398 That's a little bit more information<br />than I needed, but go right ahead.

3375641 3379969 I'm not even joking with you !<br />Do not be bringing some<br />fucked-up pooh-bah to my house !
3380040 3382099 - No choice.<br />- Wh-- She's O.D.in'?
3382180 3385368 - She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!<br />-  Just dandy.
3385451 3389639 Okay, then you bite<br />the fuckin' bullet, take her<br />to a hospital and call a lawyer.
3389720 3392149 - Negative !<br />- This is not my fuckin' problem, man !
3392220 3395948 You fucked her up,<br />you fuckin' deal with this !
3396020 3398859 Uh, are you talkin' to me<br />on a cellular phone ?
3398929 3401358 I don't know you.<br />Who is this ? Don't come here !
3401430 3404758 I'm hanging up the phone !<br />Prank caller ! Prank caller !
3412838 3415777 - What the hell was that ?
3417738 3420177 Have you lost<br />your fucking mind ?
3420249 3423178 - You were talking about drug<br />shit on a cellular phone !<br />- Lance, help me.
3423249 3426188 - You crashed your car<br />into my fucking house !<br />- Grab her feet.
3426248 3429686 Are you deaf ? You are not bringing<br />this fucked-up bitch into my house !
3429758 3432687 This "fucked-up bitch"<br />is Marsellus Wallace's wife.
3432758 3435187 - Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is ?<br />- Yeah.
3435257 3438196 If she croaks on me,<br />I am a fucking grease spot !
3438268 3442857 I will be forced to tell him<br />that you did not help and<br />let her die on your lawn.
3442937 3445866 Now, come on. Help me, help me.<br />Pick her up.
3446937 3448866 - Shit.
3450937 3453306 Lance !
3453376 3455305 Shit.
3455377 3457816 It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.
3457886 3461214 What the fuck's going on out here ?
3461286 3463215 Who's she ?
3463286 3466225 Go to the fridge and get the thing<br />with the adrenalin shot.
3466285 3468344 - What's wrong with her?<br />- She's O.D.ing!
3468426 3470485 - Get her outta here !<br />-  Get the shot !
3470555 3474083 - Fuck you ! Fuck you too !<br />- What a fuckin' bitch.
3474166 3476095 Just keep talking to her,<br />all right ?
3476165 3479094 She's gettin' the shot. I'm going<br />to go get my little black medical book.
3479165 3481154 What the fuck you need<br />a medical book for ?
3481235 3483174 I've never had to give<br />an adrenalin shot before !
3483235 3486673 I don't go joy-poppin'<br />with bubble-gummers!<br />My friends can handle their highs!
3486744 3489173 - Get the shot !<br />- I am, if you'll let me !
3489244 3492173 - I ain't stopping you !<br />- Stop talking to me.<br />Start talking to her !
3492245 3494184 - Get the shot !<br />- All right !
3497354 3500782 -Hurry up. We're losing her !<br />- I'm looking as fast as I can !
3500854 3502793 What's he looking for ?
3502853 3505792 - I don't know. Some book.<br />- What are you looking for ?
3505863 3508792 - A little black medical book.<br />- What are you looking for ?
3508864 3512962 My little black medical book ! It's<br />like a textbook they give to nurses.
3513034 3515973 - I never saw no medical book.<br />- Trust me. I have one.
3516033 3518972 - If it's so important,<br />why don't you keep it with the shot ?<br />- I don't know !
3519043 3522971 - Stop bothering me !<br />- While you're looking, that girl's<br />gonna die on our carpet.
3523042 3524971 You're never gonna find<br />anything in this mess !
3525042 3528940 - I'm gonna fucking kill you<br />if you don't shut up !<br />- Lance, get in here !
3529012 3533240 - Right ? Pig.<br />- Get the fuck outta my way.
3533322 3536750 - Quit fuckin' around<br />and give her the shot.<br />- While I'm doing this,
3536822 3540150 you take off her shirt<br />and find her heart.
3540221 3543779 - Does it gotta be exact ?<br />- We're giving her a shot in the heart,<br />so it's gotta be exact.
3543862 3546801 I don't know exactly where her heart is.<br />I think it's right here.
3546861 3550529 - That's it.<br />- All right, what I need is<br />a big, fat magic marker.
3550601 3552530 - You got it ?<br />- What ?
3552601 3555300 A magic marker.<br />A felt pen !
3555370 3557999 A fuckin' black magic marker !<br />Christ.
3558080 3563139 - Come on, man. Hurry up !<br />- Fuck ! Okay, okay.<br />Okay. I think it's ready.
3566321 3568810 - Hurry up, man.<br />- I'll tell you what to do.
3568890 3571819 - You're gonna give her the shot.<br />- No, you're gonna give her the shot.
3571890 3574819 - I ain't giving her the shot.<br />I never done this before.<br />- I never done this either !
3574890 3577878 I ain't starting now !<br />You brought her here.<br />You give her the shot.
3577959 3581357 The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch<br />to your house, then I give her the shot.
3581430 3583369 Give it to me.<br />Give me that.
3583430 3586369 All right, tell me what to do.
3586439 3589427 Okay, you're giving her an injection<br />of adrenalin straight to her heart.
3589509 3592438 - But she's got a breastplate--<br />You gotta pierce through that.
3592509 3595438 You gotta bring the needle<br />down in a stabbing motion.
3595508 3598946 - I gotta-- I gotta<br />stab her three times ?<br />- No, just stab her once !
3599019 3602447 But it's gotta be hard enough to get<br />through her breastplate into her heart.
3602519 3605448 Once you do that,<br />you p-press down on the p-plunger.
3605518 3608007 - Okay. Then what happens ?<br />- Kinda curious about that myself.
3608088 3611027 This ain't no fuckin' joke !<br />Am I gonna kill her ?
3611088 3614526 - She's supposed to come out<br />of it like that. It's--<br />- All right, count to three.
3614598 3616787 - All right. Ready ?<br />- One.
3622067 3623596 Two.
3631576 3633545 Three !
3648125 3651393 If you're all right,<br />then say something.
3651466 3654484 Something.
3654565 3656504 That was fuckin' trippy.
3659075 3662403 - Ohh.<br />- Oh, man.
3687094 3689033 Mia. Mia.
3691204 3693633 What's--
3693703 3696502 What's your thoughts on-- on--
3696573 3698602 on how to handle this ?
3698672 3700611 What's yours ?
3703682 3707580 Well, I'm of the opinion<br />that if Marsellus lived his whole life,
3707652 3711650 he doesn't need to know<br />nothing about this incident.
3711782 3714581 If Marsellus knew<br />about this incident,
3714652 3716711 I'd be in as much trouble as you.
3716781 3719280 I seriously doubt that.
3719351 3722290 I can keep a secret if you can.
3724332 3726261 Shake on it ?
3731471 3733760 Mum's the word ?
3733830 3735769 Cool.
3735841 3740169 Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going<br />to go home and have a heart attack.
3742910 3744839 Vincent.
3746710 3749738 Do you wanna hear<br />my Fox Force Five joke ?
3750820 3752749 Sure.
3752820 3755848 Except I think I'm still<br />a little too petrified to laugh.
3755919 3758858 No, you won't laugh<br />'cause it's not funny.
3758930 3762258 But if you still wanna hear it,<br />I'll tell it.
3762330 3764519 - I can't wait.<br />- Okay.
3764599 3767468 Three tomatoes<br />are walkin' down the street.
3767529 3769968 Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato<br />and Baby Tomato.
3770038 3774196 Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,<br />and Papa Tomato gets really angry.
3774268 3777207 Goes back and squishes him<br />and says,
3777279 3779368 "Ketchup."
3782218 3784147 Ketchup.
3788287 3790416 See you around.
3811477 3815175 Oh, that Paddlefoot.<br />He funny, silly dog.
3815247 3818176 He think totem pole alive !
3818246 3820975 He arctic tenderfoot !
3821046 3824714 That totem pole been here forever !
3824786 3826725 - Butch ?
3826785 3829654 One more thing, and we'll start for--
3829726 3832665 - Butch, stop watching TV for a second.<br />- Yeah ?
3832725 3836353 - You've got a special visitor.<br />- Stand up. Stand up.
3839135 3844074 Now, do you remember when I told you<br />your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp ?
3844134 3847872 Well, this here is Captain Koons.
3847945 3850874 He was in the P.O.W. camp<br />with Daddy.
3856214 3858153 Hello, little man.
3858224 3862312 Boy, I sure heard<br />a bunch about you.
3862393 3865621 See, I was a good friend<br />of your dad's.
3865694 3868722 We were in that Hanoi<br />pit of hell together...
3868794 3871263 over five years.
3871333 3873262 Hopefully...
3873333 3876272 you'll never have to<br />experience this yourself,
3876332 3879770 but when two men are in a situation<br />like me and your dad were...
3879842 3882641 for as long as we were,
3882713 3887011 you take on certain responsibilities<br />of the other.
3887083 3889012 If it'd been me who'd--
3890352 3892281 not made it,
3892352 3896620 Major Coolidge'd be talking right now<br />to my son Jim.
3896692 3900350 But the way it turned out,<br />I'm talking to you.
3901762 3903691 Butch...
3905232 3907161 I got something for ya.
3913671 3915730 This watch I got here...
3915810 3920609 was first purchased<br />by your great-grandfather<br />during the first World War.
3920681 3925340 It was bought in a little general store<br />in Knoxville, Tennessee.
3925420 3928978 Made by the first company<br />to ever make wristwatches.
3929050 3931989 Up 'til then, people just<br />carried pocket watches.
3932060 3935218 It was bought<br />by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...
3935289 3938228 on the day he set sail for Paris.
3938300 3940729 This was your<br />great-grandfather's war watch,
3940800 3944158 and he wore it every day<br />he was in that war, and...
3944229 3947797 when he'd done his duty,<br />he went home to your great-grandmother,
3947868 3952306 took the watch off,<br />put it in an old coffee can,<br />and in that can it stayed...
3952378 3956806 until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,<br />was called upon by his country...
3956878 3960606 to go overseas and fight<br />the Germans once again.
3960678 3964136 This time they called it<br />World War ll.
3964218 3969217 Your great-grandfather gave this watch<br />to your granddad for good luck.
3969287 3972285 Unfortunately, Dane's luck<br />wasn't as good as his old man's.
3972358 3975297 Dane was a Marine,<br />and he was killed...
3975367 3979385 along with all the other Marines<br />at the battle of Wake Island.
3979467 3982396 Your granddad was facing death.
3982467 3984406 He knew it.
3984466 3988404 None of those boys ever<br />had any illusions about<br />leaving that island alive,
3988476 3991674 so three days before the Japanese<br />took the island,
3991747 3996976 your granddad asked<br />a gunner on an Air Force transport,<br />name of Winocki--
3997046 3999985 a man he'd never met before<br />in his life--
4000056 4003025 to deliver to his infant son,
4003086 4007685 who he'd never seen in the flesh,<br />his gold watch.
4007756 4012094 Three days later, your granddad<br />was dead, but Winocki kept his word.
4012166 4016434 After the war was over,<br />he paid a visit to your grandmother,
4016505 4020733 delivering to your infant father<br />his dad's gold watch.
4020805 4022744 This watch.
4028614 4034053 This watch was on your daddy's wrist<br />when he was shot down over Hanoi.
4034114 4037552 He was captured,<br />put in a Vietnamese prison camp.
4037623 4041681 He knew if the gooks<br />ever saw the watch,
4041763 4045281 it'd be confiscated,<br />taken away.
4045364 4049062 The way your dad looked at it,<br />this watch was your birthright.
4049133 4053071 He'd be damned if any slope's<br />gonna put their greasy, yellow<br />hands on his boy's birthright,
4053133 4057071 so he hid it in one place he knew<br />he could hide something-- his ass.
4057143 4060571 Five long years<br />he wore this watch up his ass.
4060643 4064841 Then he died of dysentery--<br />He give me the watch.
4064912 4068780 I hid this uncomfortable<br />hunk of metal up my ass two years.
4068852 4070781 Then...
4070852 4074910 after seven years,<br />I was sent home to my family and...
4074992 4076921 now...
4079362 4082291 Little man,<br />I give the watch to you.
4105150 4107089 It's time, Butch.
4114830 4117759 In the heavyweight division,
4117829 4120987 - in the right corner<br />wearing the blue trunks,
4121069 4124327 weighing 210 pounds,
4124399 4127527 Floyd Ray Wilson !
4130608 4132537 It's official. It's official.
4132609 4135548 - Wilson is dead !<br />- Well, Dan,<br />that had to be the bloodiest,
4135618 4138047 hands down, the most brutal fight<br />this city's ever seen.
4138118 4141706 Coolidge was out of there<br />faster than I've ever seen<br />a victorious boxer leave the ring.
4141788 4144717 - Do you think he knew Wilson was dead ?<br />- My guess would be yes.
4144787 4148225 I could see the frenzy in his<br />eyes give way to the realization<br />of what he was doing.
4148297 4151725 - I think any man would've<br />left the ring that fast.<br />- Do you feel this tragedy...
4151798 4153727 is gonna affect<br />the world of boxing ?
4153797 4157735 A tragedy like this can't help<br />but shake the world of boxing<br />to its very foundations.
4157797 4161735 It's of paramount importance,<br />during the sad weeks ahead,<br />the eyes of the W.B.A. remain--
4196575 4198904 Man, you know I didn't--
4198975 4201904 - Marsellus.<br />- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.
4201974 4203913 I didn't do it.
4203975 4206474 - How you doing ?<br />- Great.
4206544 4208983 I never thanked you<br />for dinner.
4210884 4212823 - What you got ?<br />- He booked.
4212884 4215982 - His trainer ?<br />- Says he don't know nothin'.<br />I believe him.
4216053 4219491 - I think Butch surprised<br />his ass same as us.<br />- No, we don't wanna "think."
4219563 4223151 We wanna know. Take him to<br />the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.
4223234 4226662 We'll find out for goddamn sure<br />what he knows and what he don't.
4226734 4228663 Butch's search--<br />How do you want it done ?
4228733 4231672 I'm prepared to scour the Earth<br />for that motherfucker.
4231743 4235171 If Butch goes to Indochina, I want<br />a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...
4235243 4237372 ready to pop a cap in his ass.
4237442 4239581 I will take care of it.
4249322 4251691 Mister.
4254591 4257080 - Hey, mister.<br />- What ?
4257162 4261961 You were in that fight,<br />the fight on the radio.
4262032 4265470 - You're the fighter ?<br />- Whatever gave you that idea ?
4265541 4268300 No, come on.
4268371 4270310 You're him.
4270381 4272810 I know you're him.
4274550 4276449 Tell me you're him.
4276511 4278450 I'm him.
4279551 4281980 You killed the other boxing man.
4285620 4287719 He's dead ?
4287789 4290228 The radio said he was dead.
4293000 4295229 Sorry about that, Floyd.
4296529 4299028 What does it feel like ?
4299099 4301038 What does what feel like ?
4301109 4303038 Killing a man.
4304808 4308866 Beating another man to death<br />with your bare hands.
4308948 4310877 What are you, a weirdo ?
4310949 4312878 No.
4312949 4316387 It is a subject<br />I have much interest in.
4317958 4321886 You are the first person<br />I have ever met who has killed somebody.
4324398 4326827 So ?
4326897 4330155 - What does it feel like to kill a man ?
4331267 4333196 I'll tell you what.
4333268 4337206 Give me one of them cigarettes<br />you got up there, and I'll<br />tell you all about it.
4354926 4358154 So, Esmarelda...
4359456 4362864 Villa Lobos--<br />Is that Mexican?
4362925 4366163 The name is Spanish,<br />but I am Colombian.
4366236 4369534 - That's some handle<br />you got there, honey.<br />- Thank you.
4369606 4371535 And what is your name ?
4371605 4373294 Butch.
4373375 4375844 Butch.
4375904 4380673 - What does it mean ?<br />- I'm an American, honey.<br />Our names don't mean shit.
4380744 4383403 So, moving right along,
4383485 4385414 Esmarelda,
4385484 4387743 what is it you want to know ?
4387824 4392683 - I want to know what it<br />feels like to kill a man.<br />- I couldn't tell ya.
4398593 4403031 Didn't know he was dead<br />'til you told me he was dead.
4403103 4407692 Now that I know he's dead,<br />you wanna know how I feel about it ?
4411442 4414880 I don't feel<br />the least bit bad about it.
4425852 4428291 What the fuck'd I tell ya?<br />Huh?
4428362 4432290 As soon as the word got out<br />the fix was in, man, the odds<br />went through the roof.
4432361 4434560 I know. I know.<br />Unbelievable.
4434631 4438069 Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was<br />a better boxer, he'd still be alive.
4438132 4440071 If he never<br />laced up his gloves,
4440132 4442571 which he never shoulda done in the first<br />fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.
4444641 4448229 Yeah, well, who gives a fuck ?<br />It's over now.
4448310 4451239 Yeah, well, enough about the poor,<br />unfortunate Mr. Floyd.
4451310 4455008 Let's talk about the rich<br />and prosperous Mr. Butch.
4455081 4458020 How many bookies did you<br />lay it around on ?
4458091 4460520 All eight ?<br />How long to collect ?
4462160 4465089 So you'll have it all<br />by tomorrow night ? No, I understand.
4465159 4468317 A few stragglers aside.<br />Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.
4468399 4470628 That is great news, man.
4470699 4474897 Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne<br />are gonna leave in the morning.
4474969 4478227 It'll probably take us<br />a couple days to get down to Knoxville.
4478309 4480238 Okay, my brother.
4480309 4482278 You're right.
4482339 4484678 You're goddamn right.
4484749 4488237 All right, Scotty, next time I see you,<br />it'll be on Tennessee time.
4488318 4490647 Cool, brother.
4505797 4508226 $45.60.
4511808 4513737 And, uh,
4513807 4517105 here's a little something<br />for the effort.
4517177 4521105 Now, if anybody asks you who your fare<br />was tonight, what are you gonna say ?
4521177 4523116 The truth.
4523176 4526674 Three well-dressed,<br />slightly toasted Mexicans.
4528586 4530985 Bonsoir,<br />Esmarelda Villa Lobos.
4531056 4533575 Buenas Noches, Butch.
4544706 4546635 Whew.
4548006 4549995 Keep the light off.
4550075 4553004 - Is that better, Sugar Pop?<br />- Oui.
4557484 4559413 Hard day at the office ?
4559484 4561413 Pretty hard.
4561485 4563714 Got in a fight.
4563784 4565943 Poor baby.
4566025 4568584 Can you make spoons ?
4568654 4571593 You know what?<br />I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.
4571664 4575592 - I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.<br />- I like the way you stink.
4575663 4578092 Let me take this jacket off.
4580264 4583792 - I was looking at myself in the mirror.<br />- Uh-huh.
4583874 4585803 I wish I had a pot.
4587573 4591511 You were looking<br />at yourself in the mirror,<br />and you wish you had some pot ?
4591583 4594512 A pot.<br />A pot belly.
4594582 4596741 Pot bellies are sexy.
4596813 4599112 Well, you should be happy,
4599182 4601121 'cause you have one.
4601193 4604641 Shut up, fatso.<br />I don't have a pot.
4604722 4608590 I have a bit of a tummy,<br />like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star."
4608661 4610590 It's not the same thing.
4610661 4614599 I didn't know there was<br />such a difference between<br />a pot belly and a tummy.
4614672 4616601 The difference is huge.
4616671 4620099 Would you like it if I had a pot belly ?
4620171 4622110 No.
4622171 4626609 Pot bellies make a man<br />look either oafish or like a gorilla.
4626680 4629768 But on a woman<br />a pot belly's very sexy.
4629850 4635289 The rest of you is normal-- normal face,<br />normal legs, normal hips, normal ass--
4635350 4639408 but with a big,<br />perfectly round pot belly.
4639490 4642429 If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt<br />two sizes too small...
4642490 4644429 to accentuate it.
4644499 4646928 You think men<br />would find that attractive ?
4646999 4650157 I don't give a damn<br />what men find attractive.
4650230 4653688 It's unfortunate what we find pleasing<br />to the touch and pleasing to the eye...
4653770 4655709 is seldom the same.
4659109 4662707 If you had a pot belly,<br />I would punch you in it.
4662779 4665718 - You'd punch me in the belly ?<br />- Right in the belly.
4665778 4667717 Ohh ! I'd smother you !
4667789 4671717 - I'd drop it right on your face<br />'til you couldn't breathe !
4671789 4673718 - You'd do that ?<br />- Yeah.
4673788 4675757 - Promise ?<br />- Yeah.
4679257 4681196 - Mmm.<br />- Mmm.
4683427 4685866 Oh.
4689307 4691236 Did you get everything ?
4691307 4694295 - Yes, I did.<br />- Good job, Sugar Pop.
4694377 4696306 Did everything<br />go as planned ?
4696377 4699106 - You didn't listen to the-- Ow !
4699177 4701116 You didn't listen to the radio ?
4701186 4704474 I never listen to your fights.<br />Were you the winner ?
4704557 4706846 I won, all right.
4706916 4709885 - Are you still retiring ?<br />- Sure am.
4709956 4712325 So it all worked out<br />in the finish.
4713756 4717194 We're not at the finish yet, baby.
4725136 4728005 We're in a lot of danger,<br />aren't we ?
4729575 4732514 If they find us,<br />they'll kill us, won't they ?
4734585 4737514 But they won't find us,<br />will they ?
4740415 4743354 Do you still want me<br />to go with you ?
4744924 4748582 I don't want to be a burden<br />or a nuisance. It's--
4755203 4757562 Say it.
4757634 4760233 - Fabienne,
4760303 4763431 I want you to be with me.
4763503 4766501 - Forever ?<br />- Forever and ever.
4768642 4770611 Do you love me ?
4770683 4772672 Very, very much.
4778392 4780951 - Butch.<br />- Yes ?
4782392 4784981 Will you give me<br />oral pleasure ?
4786491 4788430 Will you kiss it ?
4790361 4792560 But you first.
4792632 4795471 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
4805681 4807980 Butch.
4808050 4811478 Mon amour.<br />L'aventure commence.
4827139 4829578 I think I cracked a rib.
4829640 4833078 - Giving me oral pleasure ?<br />- No, retard, from the fight.
4833150 4836578 - Don't call me "retard."<br />-  My name is Fabby.
4836649 4839138 - My name is Fabienne !<br />- Stop it.
4839219 4841148 - Stop it !<br />- My name is Fabi--
4841219 4844158 Shut up, fuckhead !<br />I hate that mongoloid voice.
4844228 4847316 Okay, okay.<br />Sorry, sorry, sorry.
4847399 4850328 - I take it back.
4852328 4855267 Will you hand me a dry towel,<br />Miss Beautiful Tulip ?
4855338 4859266 - Oh, I like that.<br />I like being called a tulip.
4859338 4861767 "Tulip" is much better<br />than "mongoloid."
4861837 4864776 I didn't call you a mongoloid.<br />I called you a retard.
4864848 4866967 And I took it back.
4867047 4869136 - Butch ?
4869218 4871147 Yes, Lemon Pie ?
4871217 4874645 - Where are we going to go ?<br />- Well, I'm not sure yet.
4874717 4876846 Wherever you want.
4876917 4879856 We're gonna get a lot<br />of money from this,
4879926 4882855 but it ain't gonna be<br />the kind of money...
4882927 4885866 that we can live like hogs<br />in the fathouse forever.
4885927 4889865 I was thinking maybe we could go<br />down someplace in the South Pacific.
4889936 4893364 Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna<br />carry us a long way down there.
4893435 4896374 - If we wanted,<br />we could live in Bora Bora?<br />- You betcha.
4896435 4899873 And if after a while you didn't<br />dig that, we could go someplace else.
4899946 4901875 Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.
4901946 4903875 But I do not speak Spanish.
4903946 4906915 Well, you do not speak<br />Bora-Boran either.
4906985 4908954 Besides, Mexican's easy.
4909015 4911954 - Â¿ Donde esta el zapateria?<br />- What does that mean?
4912024 4913953 Where is the shoe store?
4914024 4915953 - Â¿ Donde esta--<br />- Spit, please.
4918025 4921293 - Â¿ Donde esta el zapateria ?<br />- Excellent pronunciation.
4921364 4923383 - Mmm.
4923464 4926762 You'll be my little mamacita<br />in no time.
4926834 4929363 -  Â¿ Que hora es ?<br />- Â¿ Que hora es ?
4929433 4931592 - What time is it ?<br />- What time is it ?
4931674 4934303 Time for bed.
4934373 4936312 Sweet dreams, jellybean.
4944023 4945952 Butch ?
4951862 4953791 Never mind.
4960772 4963391 Aah !
4963472 4967530 Merde! You startled me.<br />Did you have a bad dream?
4977981 4982249 - What is this you're watching ?<br />- A motorcycle movie.
4982321 4984250 I'm not sure the name.
4986160 4989248 - Are you watching it ?<br />- In a way.
4991061 4995159 It's a little early in the morning<br />for explosions and war.
4998000 5002438 - What was it about ?<br />- How should I know ?<br />You were the one watching it.
5002510 5006498 - No, imbecile,<br />what was your dream about ?<br />- I don't know.
5006580 5008509 I don't remember.
5008580 5011509 It's really rare<br />that I remember my dreams.
5011580 5014549 Well, let's look<br />at the grumpy man in the morning.
5016619 5019558 Why don't you get up<br />and we'll get some breakfast.
5019619 5022248 One more kiss,<br />and I'll get up.
5024399 5027627 - Satisfied ?<br />- Yep.
5027698 5031126 -  Get up, lazy bones !<br />- Ohh !
5031198 5034256 - Ohh. God.
5035568 5039096 - What time is it ?<br />- Almost nine in the morning.
5039177 5042935 - What time does our train arrive ?<br />- Eleven.
5043008 5047376 - You know what I'm gonna<br />have for breakfast ?<br />- What, Lemon Pie ?
5047448 5051576 I'm gonna order a big plate<br />of blueberry pancakes...
5051657 5053586 with maple syrup,
5053657 5057085 eggs over easy<br />and five sausages.
5057156 5059355 Anything to drink with that ?
5059426 5063084 Wow, that looks nice.
5063166 5066494 To drink-- A tall glass<br />of orange juice...
5066566 5068995 and a black cup of coffee.
5069066 5073635 - After that, I'm going to<br />have a slice of pie.<br />- Pie for breakfast ?
5073706 5077644 - Any time of the day<br />is a good time for pie.
5077716 5080645 Blueberry pie<br />to go with the pancakes.
5080715 5083703 And on top, a thin slice<br />of melted cheese.
5083785 5085714 Where's my watch ?
5090184 5092453 It's there.
5092524 5095113 - No, it's not.<br />- Have you looked ?
5095194 5099462 Yes, I've fuckin' looked.<br />What the fuck do you think I'm doin' ?
5099534 5101653 You sure you got it ?
5101734 5104033 Yes.<br />Bedside table drawer.
5104104 5107262 - On the little kangaroo ?<br />- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.
5107333 5110501 Yeah, well,<br />it's not here now.
5110573 5113442 - Well, it should be.
5113514 5117312 Yes, it most definitely should be,<br />but it's not here now !<br />So where the fuck is it ?
5122883 5126321 Fabienne,<br />where's my father's fucking watch ?
5127993 5132431 Do you have any idea what he had<br />to go through to get me that watch ?
5132493 5135432 I don't have time to go into it,<br />but he went through a lot.
5135503 5140832 All this other shit you could've set<br />on fire, but I specifically reminded<br />you not to forget the fucking watch.
5140902 5142231 Now think.
5142302 5145830 - Did you get it ?<br />- I believe so.
5145911 5149169 "You believe so" ?<br />What the fuck does that mean ?<br />You either did or didn't get it.
5150582 5152511 Then I did.
5153882 5155821 Are you sure ?
5156921 5158850 No.
5160960 5162889 Fuck ! Fuck ! Fuck !
5162961 5165320 Motherfucker !<br />Motherfuckin'--
5167231 5170030 Do you know how fucking stupid<br />you fucking are ?
5170100 5172029 No !
5174670 5176599 It's not your fault.
5181410 5183839 You left it at the apartment.
5189420 5192848 If you left it at the apartment,<br />it's not your fault.
5194919 5198047 I had you bring<br />a bunch of stuff.
5200258 5202197 I reminded you about it,
5202258 5207027 but I didn't illustrate<br />how personal the watch was to me.
5207099 5211127 If all I gave a fuck about was<br />the watch, I shoulda told you that.
5211208 5213637 You're not a mind reader.
5213708 5215637 Are you ?
5225788 5227717 I-- I'm sorry.
5227787 5231375 Don't be. Just means<br />I can't have breakfast with you.
5231457 5234146 Why does it mean that ?
5236726 5240054 Because I gotta go back to my apartment<br />and get my watch.
5241266 5243785 Won't the gangsters<br />be looking for you there ?
5243867 5248135 Well, that's what<br />I'm gonna find out.
5248206 5251434 If they are, and I don't think<br />I can handle it,
5251506 5253445 then I'll split.
5253505 5257803 I saw your watch. I thought<br />I brought it. I'm so sorry.
5263085 5266143 Here's some money.<br />Go out and get those pancakes.
5266225 5268084 Have a nice breakfast.
5268154 5271592 I'll take your Honda. I'll be back<br />before you can say "blueberry pie."
5271664 5274093 Blueberry pie.
5274165 5276324 Maybe not that fast.
5276395 5279593 - But pretty fast. Okay ?<br />- Okay.
5279665 5282004 - Bye.<br />- Bye.
5282074 5285003 Shit ! Of all the fuckin' things<br />she could fuckin' forget,
5285074 5287003 she forgets my father's watch !
5287073 5289012 I specifically reminded her--
5289073 5291202 bedside table, on the kangaroo.
5291283 5294541 I said the words:<br />"Don't forget my father's watch."
5310033 5313461 Visit the Jackrabbit Slim's<br />nearest you...
5323612 5327770 El burro!
5451444 5453373 Lookin' good, Butch.
5622465 5624524 If I were walkin'<br />in your shoes
5632075 5637514 Countin' flowers on the wall<br />That don't bother me at all
5637584 5642022 Playin' solitaire 'til dawn<br />with a deck of fifty-one
5644094 5646023 That's how you're gonna<br />beat 'em, Butch.
5645094 5648322 -  Smokin' cigarettes and<br />watchin' Captain Kangaroo
5647093 5649092 - They keep underestimatin' ya.
5648393 5650322 Now don't tell me
5651893 5655351 Countin' flowers on the wall
5655433 5658891 That don't bother me at all
5658973 5664502 Playin' solitaire 'til dawn<br />with a deck of fifty-one
5664572 5669311 Smokin' cigarettes<br />and watchin' Captain Kangaroo

5679351 5681820 -  Anyway my eyes
5681351 5681820 - Motherfucker.
5681891 5684260 -  Are not accustomed--
5681891 5684260 - Uhh!
5693931 5696370 Do you think he's dead ?<br />- He's dead.
5696440 5698669 - Oh, my God.<br />- He's dead.
5708550 5712478 If you need someone to go<br />to court, I'll be glad to help.<br />That guy was a drunken maniac.
5712550 5715489 He hit you, then he<br />crashed into that car.
5715560 5717489 - Who ?<br />- Him.
5721560 5723759 I'll be damned.
5734968 5736937 - Ohh !
5739409 5741708 - Aaaah! I'm shot!
5748518 5751916 - Sally ! Sally !
5755427 5757356 - Aaah!
5759697 5761626 Motherfucker !
5764267 5767725 - Can I help you with somethin' ?<br />- Shut the fuck up.
5767806 5770735 Now you just wait<br />a goddamn minute, now !
5770806 5772775 What the fuck you up to ?
5772846 5775465 - Come here, motherfucker !
5775547 5778446 - You feel that sting, huh, big boy ?
5778517 5780446 That's pride<br />fuckin' with you, see ?
5780516 5783954 You gotta fight through that shit !
5784016 5787014 - You'd better kill me--<br />- Yeah, somebody's gonna get killed.
5787086 5789645 Somebody's gonna get<br />their motherfuckin' head blown to--
5789725 5792244 - Hold it right there, goddamn it.
5792326 5796094 - This ain't none<br />of your business, mister.<br />- I'm makin' it my business.
5796166 5798895 - Toss the weapon.<br />- You don't understand, man.
5798965 5800994 Toss the weapon.
5806304 5809003 - Take your foot off the nigger,
5809075 5811014 - put your hand behind your head,
5811075 5813134 approach the counter right now.
5813214 5815233 - This motherfucker's trying to...

6411341 6414280 - What now ?
6416611 6418550 "What now" ?
6419920 6423348 - Let me tell you what now.
6423420 6426359 I'm gonna call a couple of hard,<br />pipe-hittin' niggers...
6426420 6429359 to go to work<br />on the homes here...
6429430 6432359 with a pair of pliers<br />and a blowtorch.
6434330 6437029 You hear me talkin',<br />hillbilly boy ?
6438300 6440859 I ain't through with you<br />by a damn sight !
6440939 6443868 I'm gonna get medieval<br />on your ass.
6447149 6450078 I meant what now<br />between me and you.
6455148 6457547 Oh, that "what now."
6458988 6462926 - I tell you what now<br />between me and you.
6464497 6467426 There is no me and you.
6468867 6470796 Not no more.
6473868 6475807 So, are we cool ?
6477177 6479466 Yeah, we cool.
6479537 6481666 - Two things.
6483447 6486376 Don't tell nobody about this.
6487847 6491475 This shit is between me, you...
6491557 6496015 and Mr. "Soon-To-Be-Livin'<br />The-Rest-Of-His-Short-Ass-<br />Life-ln-Agonizing-Pain"...
6496086 6498025 rapist here.
6499325 6502084 It ain't nobody else's business.
6502165 6504094 Two:
6504165 6507653 You leave town tonight.<br />Right now.
6508905 6510834 And when you gone,
6510905 6512834 you stay gone,
6512905 6515844 - or you be gone.
6515905 6518844 You lost all your L.A. privileges.<br />Deal ?
6520684 6522613 Deal.
6523855 6525784 Get your ass outta here.
6552243 6554492 Oh, shit.
6587491 6589920 Fabienne !
6590991 6593930 Fabienne !
6595161 6597260 Fabienne !<br />Come on, baby.
6597330 6600768 - Come on. Get your shit.<br />We gotta go right now.<br />- I was so worried.
6600840 6604268 - What about our bags ?<br />- Fuck the bags; if we don't split<br />right now, we'll miss the train.
6604340 6606269 - I'll be downstairs.<br />- Is everything well ?
6606339 6610277 - Just come on ! No talking now !<br />- Are we in danger ?
6613780 6615719 Come on, honey !
6617790 6620259 Where did you get<br />this motorcycle ?
6620319 6624848 - It's not a motorcycle, baby.<br />It's a chopper. Let's go.<br />- What happened to my Honda ?
6624928 6628686 I'm sorry, baby,<br />I had to crash that Honda.<br />Will you come on now, please ?
6628758 6631157 Come on. Let's go,<br />let's go, let's go.
6635738 6639166 - You're hurt ?<br />- No, no, I might've broken<br />my nose. It's no biggie.
6639238 6642177 Come on. Hop on.<br />Baby, please, we--
6642247 6645176 Honey, we gotta hit<br />the fuckin' road ! Get on !
6646847 6650285 - Oh, baby, I'm sorry.<br />Come here, come here.
6650348 6652287 I'm sorry. Mmm.
6652358 6656286 - I'm so sorry.<br />- You were gone so long, I started<br />to think dreadful thoughts.
6656357 6659286 I didn't mean to worry you.<br />Everything's fine.
6659357 6661296 - How was your breakfast ?<br />- It was good.
6661357 6663296 Did you get<br />the blueberry pancakes ?
6663366 6667294 They didn't have blueberry; I had to get<br />buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay ?
6667367 6670306 Since I left you,<br />this has been, without a doubt,
6670367 6673595 the single weirdest<br />fuckin' day of my life--<br />I'll tell you all about it.
6673676 6675535 Gotta go. Come on.
6675606 6678375 Butch, whose motorcycle<br />is this ?
6678445 6681034 - It's a chopper, baby.<br />- Whose chopper is this ?
6681115 6683044 - Zed's.<br />- Who's Zed ?
6683115 6685674 Zed's dead, baby.<br />Zed's dead.
6701865 6704164 Yes, you did, Brett !
6704234 6707762 You tried to fuck him,<br />and Marsellus Wallace<br />don't liked to be fucked...
6707834 6710273 by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.
6710344 6713432 - Oh, God, please. I don't wanna die.<br />- You read the Bible, Brett ?
6713513 6716941 -  Yes !<br />- Well, there's this passage<br />I got memorized.
6717013 6719172 Sorta fits the occasion.
6719254 6722542 Ezekiel 25:17.
6722623 6726921 "The path of the righteous man<br />is beset on all sides...
6726993 6728922 by the inequities<br />of the selfish...
6728993 6732421 - and the tyranny of evil men.
6732493 6737162 Blessed is he who, in the name<br />of charity and good will,
6737233 6740261 shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness,
6740332 6742861 for he is truly<br />his brother's keeper...
6742942 6745671 and the finder<br />of lost children.
6745742 6750000 And I will strike down upon thee<br />with great vengeance...
6750081 6752240 and furious anger...
6752311 6756709 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy My brothers.
6756782 6760650 And you will know<br />My name is the Lord...
6760721 6764119 when I lay My vengeance<br />upon thee."
6772200 6774629 I'm fucked.<br />Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
6774701 6777640 -  ls he a friend of yours ?<br />- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.
6777701 6780640 Hmm ? Oh.<br />Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.
6780710 6783639 - Better tell him to shut up.<br />He's gettin' on my nerves.<br />- Fuck.
6783710 6786908 Marvin. Marvin !<br />I'd knock that shit off if I was you.
6786980 6791138 - Die, you motherfuckers ! Die !
6819308 6822746 Why the fuck didn't you tell us<br />somebody was in the bathroom ?
6822818 6825677 Slip your mind ? Did you forget<br />that someone was in there...
6825747 6827686 with a goddamn hand cannon ?
6827748 6831686 You see the size of that gun he fired<br />at us ? It was bigger than him.
6836457 6839156 We should be fuckin' dead, man.
6839226 6841165 I know.<br />We was lucky.
6841226 6844354 No, no, no, no.<br />That shit wasn't luck.
6844437 6848635 - Yeah, maybe.<br />- This was divine intervention.
6848707 6850636 You know what<br />divine intervention is ?
6856515 6858444 I think so.
6858516 6861944 That means that God came down<br />from Heaven and stopped the bullets.
6862016 6864455 That's right.<br />That's exactly what it means.
6864516 6867485 God came down from Heaven<br />and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.
6868725 6870714 I think it's time for us<br />to leave, Jules.
6870795 6873224 Don't do that.<br />Don't fuckin' blow this shit off !
6873295 6877233 - What just happened here<br />was a fuckin' miracle !<br />- Chill. This shit happens.
6877294 6880063 Wrong ! Wrong.<br />This shit doesn't "just happen."
6880135 6883573 Do you want to continue<br />this theological discussion in a car...
6883634 6886073 or in a jailhouse<br />with the cops ?
6886144 6888763 We should be fuckin' dead,<br />my friend !
6888844 6893072 What happened here was a miracle, and I<br />want you to fucking acknowledge it !
6893144 6897843 All right, it was a miracle.<br />Can we go now ?
6904853 6908221 Let's go, nigger !<br />Come on ! Shit.
6910102 6911901 You ever seen that show Cops ?
6911973 6914902 I was watching it one time,<br />and there was this cop on,
6914972 6918910 and he was talkin' about this<br />gunfight he had in the hallway<br />with this guy, right ?
6918982 6922430 He just unloaded on this guy and nothin'<br />happened. He didn't hit nothin'.
6922512 6925451 Okay ? It was just<br />him and this guy.
6925522 6928850 I mean, you know, it's,<br />it's freaky, but it happens.
6928922 6933861 You wanna play blind man,<br />go walk with the shepherd,<br />but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.
6933922 6936861 - What the fuck does that mean ?<br />- It means that's it for me.
6936931 6939620 From here on in, you can<br />consider my ass retired.
6939701 6941860 - Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.<br />- Don't blaspheme.
6941931 6944989 - I said, don't do that!<br />- Hey, why are you fuckin'<br />freakin' out on us?
6945070 6948128 Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today--<br />I'm through.
6948210 6951139 - Why don't you tell him<br />at the same time why ?<br />- Don't worry, I will.
6951211 6955199 - And I bet you $10,000<br />he laughs his ass off.<br />- I don't give a damn if he does.
6955280 6958368 Marvin, what do you make of all this ?
6958450 6960879 Man, I don't even<br />have an opinion.
6960950 6965178 You gotta have an opinion. You think<br />God came down from Heaven and stopped--
6965260 6967249 - What the fuck's happenin'?
6967319 6969258 - Aw, shit, man !<br />- Aw, man !
6969330 6972259 - Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.<br />- Why the fuck'd you do that ?
6971630 6973559 I didn't mean it.<br />It was an accident.
6973630 6976569 - Man, I seen some crazy-ass<br />shit in my time, but this--<br />- Chill out, man !
6976629 6979568 It was an accident. We probably<br />went over a bump or somethin'.
6979639 6981568 The car ain't hit<br />no motherfuckin' bump.
6981638 6984966 I didn't mean to shoot<br />the son of a bitch. The gun went off.
6985038 6988476 Look at this fuckin' mess ! We're on<br />a city street in broad daylight here !
6988549 6991478 - I don't believe it !<br />- Well, believe it now, motherfucker !
6991549 6995007 We gotta get this car off<br />the road. Cops notice shit<br />like a car drenched in blood.
6994588 6997517 - Just take it to<br />a friendly place, that's all !<br />- This is the Valley, Vincent.
6997588 7000017 Marsellus ain't got<br />no friendly places in the Valley.
7000088 7003027 - Well, Jules, this ain't<br />my fuckin' town, man !<br />- Shit !
7003097 7006026 - What you doing?<br />- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.
7006098 7009626 -Where's Toluca Lake ?<br />-Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.
7009698 7012637 If Jimmie's ass ain't home,<br />I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,
7012697 7015636 'cause I ain't got<br />no other partners in 818.
7015707 7018636 Jimmie, how you doin', man ?<br />It's Jules. Just listen up, man.
7018707 7022645 Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we<br />gotta get it off the road, pronto.
7022707 7024906 I need to use your garage<br />for a couple hours.
7026917 7029846 We gotta be real fuckin' delicate<br />with this Jimmie situation.
7029916 7033544 He's one remark away<br />from kickin' our asses out the door.
7033626 7036555 - If he does, what do we do ?<br />- We ain't leavin'<br />'til we make a couple calls,
7036626 7039555 but I don't want it to reach<br />that pitch-- Jimmie's a friend.
7039625 7042564 You don't come into your friend's house<br />and start tellin' him what's what.
7042626 7044565 Just tell him<br />not to be abusive.
7044636 7046565 He kinda freaked out back there<br />when he saw Marvin.
7046635 7049793 Put yourself in his position--<br />It's 8:00 in the morning,<br />he just woke up.
7049865 7051804 He wasn't expectin' this shit.
7051875 7054804 We gotta remember here<br />who's doin' who a favor.
7054875 7058813 If that favor means I gotta<br />take shit, he can stick that<br />favor straight up his ass.
7059175 7063113 - Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd<br />you just do to his towel, man?<br />- I was dryin' my hands!
7063185 7066114 - You're supposed to wash 'em first !<br />- You watched me wash 'em.
7066184 7069742 - I watched you get 'em wet.<br />- I was washin' 'em.<br />This shit's hard to get off.
7069823 7071752 Maybe if he'd had Lava<br />I coulda done a better job.
7071824 7073753 I used the same<br />fuckin' soap you did,
7073823 7076762 and when I finished, the towel<br />didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad !
7076824 7079763 What if he was to come in here<br />and see his towel like this ?
7079833 7083921 It's shit like this that's gonna bring<br />this situation to a head, man !
7084003 7087431 Look, I ain't threatenin' you<br />or nothin', all right?
7087503 7091961 You know I respect you and all.<br />But just don't put me<br />in this position, all right ?
7092042 7094741 All right.<br />Fine. Fine.
7094813 7097742 Ask me nice like that,<br />no problem.
7097812 7100751 Just go handle your friend.<br />Go ahead. I don't care.
7102482 7105351 Mmm ! Goddamn, Jimmie !
7105422 7107511 This some serious<br />gourmet shit.
7107592 7109521 Me and Vincent<br />would've been satisfied...
7109591 7111560 with some freeze-dried<br />Taster's Choice.
7111632 7113561 Right ?
7113632 7116561 And he springs this<br />serious gourmet shit on us.
7116632 7118691 - What flavor is this ?<br />- Knock it off, Julie.
7118771 7122789 - What ?<br />- I don't need you to tell me<br />how fuckin' good my coffee is.
7122871 7125360 I'm the one who buys it.<br />I know how good it is.
7125441 7127370 When Bonnie goes shopping,<br />she buys shit.
7127440 7131068 I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause<br />when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
7131151 7135079 But you know what's on<br />my mind right now ? It ain't<br />the coffee in my kitchen.
7135151 7137310 It's the dead nigger<br />in my garage.
7137390 7140818 - Jimmie, don't even worry--<br />- Don't tell me about anything.<br />I wanna ask you a question.
7140890 7142819 When you came pulling in here,
7142890 7146088 did you notice the sign<br />on the front of my house that said,<br />"Dead Nigger Storage" ?
7146159 7149597 - You know I ain't seen no--<br />- Did you notice the sign on<br />the front of my house...
7149660 7151599 that said,<br />"Dead Nigger Storage" ?
7151670 7154399 No. I didn't.
7154469 7157398 - You know why you didn't<br />see that sign ?<br />- Why ?
7157469 7161998 'Cause it ain't there,<br />'cause storing dead niggers<br />ain't my fuckin' business, that's why !
7162078 7165007 - We're not gonna store<br />the motherfucker--<br />- Don't you fuckin' realize...
7165079 7169517 that if Bonnie comes home and<br />finds a dead body in her house,<br />I'm gonna get divorced ?
7169579 7172817 No marriage counselor.<br />No trial separation.<br />I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.
7172888 7176246 Okay ? And I don't wanna<br />get fuckin' divorced !
7176318 7181317 Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,<br />but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.
7181397 7183486 Jimmie, Jimmie,<br />she ain't gonna leave you.
7183558 7187496 Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules !<br />Okay ? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.
7187568 7191526 There's nothin' you're gonna<br />say that's gonna make me forget<br />I love my wife. Is there ?
7194677 7199336 Now, look, you know, she comes home<br />from work in about an hour and a half.
7199406 7202464 The graveyard shift<br />at the hospital.
7202547 7205605 You gotta make some phone calls ?<br />You gotta call some people ?
7205687 7209615 Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck<br />out of my house before she gets here.
7209686 7212625 That's Kool and the Gang.<br />We don't wanna fuck your shit up.
7212685 7215654 All I wanna do is call my people<br />and get 'em to bring us in.
7215725 7218664 You're fucking my shit up<br />right now !
7218726 7221824 You're gonna fuck my shit up<br />big time if Bonnie comes home.
7221895 7225393 Do me that favor, all right ?<br />The phone is in my bedroom.<br />I suggest you get going.
7225465 7228404 Well, say she comes home.
7228475 7230904 What do you think she'll do ?
7232405 7234844 Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.
7234914 7237103 That ain't no kinda answer.
7237175 7240233 I mean, you know, I don't.<br />How much ? A lot or a little ?
7240314 7243183 You got to appreciate<br />what an explosive element...
7243254 7245183 this Bonnie situation is.
7245254 7249192 She comes home from a hard day's work,<br />finds a bunch of gangsters<br />in her kitchen...
7249253 7251192 doing a bunch of gangster shit,
7251263 7254321 there ain't no tellin'<br />what she's liable to do.
7256494 7258433 Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.
7258503 7261092 All I'm doing is<br />contemplating the ifs.
7261173 7264102 I don't wanna hear about<br />no motherfuckin' ifs !
7264173 7268101 All I want to hear from your ass<br />is, "You ain't got no problem,<br />Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.
7268173 7272341 Chill them niggers out<br />and wait for the cavalry,<br />which should be coming directly."
7272413 7275571 You ain't got no problem, Jules.
7275652 7277771 I'm on the motherfucker.
7277853 7282912 Chill them niggers out and wait for<br />the Wolf, who should be coming directly.
7282992 7285421 You sendin' the Wolf?
7285492 7287681 Oh, you feel better,<br />motherfucker ?
7287761 7290020 Shit, yeah, negro !
7290092 7293220 That's all you had to say !
7293301 7296489 - She the hysterical type ?
7296571 7299500 - When is she due ?
7299571 7301660 Mm-hmm.
7301740 7303669 Give me<br />the principals' names again.
7303741 7305680 Place your bets.
7306740 7310408 - Jules. Mm-hmm.<br />- Cards, please.
7310481 7312420 Vincent.
7317150 7319089 Jimmie.
7320319 7322448 Bonnie. Mm-hmm.
7327870 7330958 It's thirty minutes away.<br />I'll be there in ten.
7347778 7350707 You're... Jimmie, right ?<br />This is your house ?
7350778 7354406 - It sure is.<br />- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.
7354488 7357417 - Good. We got one.<br />- So I heard. May I come in ?
7357488 7359417 Uh, yeah. Please do.
7359487 7363145 You must be Jules.<br />Which would make you... Vincent.
7363228 7365657 Let's get down<br />to brass tacks, gentlemen.
7365728 7368667 If I was informed correctly, the clock<br />is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie ?
7368727 7370666 Uh, one hundred percent.
7370737 7374665 - Your wife Bonnie comes home<br />at 9:30 in the a.m., correct ?<br />- Uh-huh.
7374737 7379226 I was led to believe if she<br />comes home and finds us here,<br />she wouldn't appreciate it much.
7379307 7383605 - She wouldn't at that.<br />- That gives us 40 minutes<br />to get the fuck outta Dodge,
7383677 7387115 which, if you do what I say,<br />when I say it, should be plenty.
7387186 7391514 Now, you got a corpse<br />in a car, minus a head,<br />in a garage. Take me to it.
7399256 7401195 - Jimmie.<br />- Uh-huh.
7401265 7404693 Do me a favor, will ya ? Thought I<br />smelled some coffee back there.
7404765 7408203 - Would you make me a cup ?<br />- Uh, yeah, sure.
7409664 7412603 Oh, uh, um,<br />how do you take it ?
7412674 7415233 Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
7417315 7420743 About the car, is there anything<br />I need to know ? Does it stall ?
7420814 7424252 Does it smoke ? Does it make<br />a lot of noise ? ls there gas in it ?
7424314 7427752 - Aside from how it looks,<br />the car's cool.<br />- Positive ?
7427823 7431251 Don't get me on the road and I find out<br />the brake lights don't work.
7431323 7435381 - As far as I know,<br />the motherfucker's tip-top.<br />- Good enough.
7435464 7437483 Let's go back<br />to the kitchen.
7443133 7446072 - Here you go, Mr. Wolf.<br />- Thank you, Jimmie.
7450913 7452842 Mmm.
7453912 7456041 Okay, first thing.<br />You two.
7456113 7459052 Take the body,<br />stick it in the trunk.
7459112 7461841 This looks to be<br />a pretty domesticated house.
7461922 7465850 - That would lead me to believe<br />you got cleansers and shit.<br />- Yeah. Under the sink.
7465921 7469359 Good. What I need you two fellas to do<br />is take those cleaning products...
7469422 7473450 and clean the inside of the car--<br />I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.
7473532 7477460 Go in the back seat, scoop up all<br />those little pieces of brain and skull.
7477531 7480470 Get it out of there.<br />Wipe down the upholstery.
7480540 7483469 It don't need to be spick-and-span.<br />You don't need to eat off it.
7483540 7487908 Just give it a good once-over.<br />What you need to take care of<br />are the really messy parts.
7487981 7492069 The pools of blood that have collected,<br />you gotta soak that shit up.
7492150 7494579 We need to raid<br />your linen closet.
7494650 7497579 I need blankets,<br />I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.
7497650 7501278 The thicker the better,<br />the darker the better.<br />No whites. Can't use 'em.
7501359 7506658 We'll need to camouflage the front seat<br />and back seat and floorboards...
7506730 7508659 with quilts and blankets,
7508730 7512668 so if a cop starts stickin'<br />his big snout in the car,<br />the subterfuge won't last,
7512729 7515598 but at a glance the car<br />will appear to be normal.
7515669 7517728 Jimmie, lead the way.<br />Boys, get to work.
7517809 7519568 "Please" would be nice.
7521038 7523977 - Come again ?<br />- I said, a "please" would be nice.
7525878 7529706 Get it straight, buster.<br />I'm not here to say please.<br />I'm here to tell you what to do.
7531518 7534447 And if self-preservation<br />is an instinct you possess,
7534517 7536956 you'd better fuckin' do it<br />and do it quick.
7537027 7540925 I'm here to help. If my help's<br />not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.
7540998 7544326 No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;<br />your help is definitely appreciated.
7544398 7547327 Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't<br />mean disrespect, okay ? I respect you.
7547397 7550196 I just don't like people<br />barkin' orders at me.
7550267 7553325 If I'm curt with you,<br />it's because time is a factor.
7553407 7558036 I think fast, I talk fast,<br />and I need you guys to act fast<br />if you wanna get out of this.
7558107 7561545 So pretty please, with sugar on top,<br />clean the fuckin' car.
7566046 7569714 Don't be lookin' at me like that,<br />all right ? I can feel your look.
7572425 7575114 It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
7577196 7579125 Green.
7580736 7583665 Nothin' except for<br />the mess inside.
7585865 7588304 Mmm, about 20 minutes.
7589805 7591744 Nobody who'll be missed.
7593815 7596744 You're a good man, Joe.<br />Thanks a bunch.
7597845 7599784 - How we comin', Jimmie ?<br />- Pretty good.
7599844 7603012 - I got it all here, but, uh,
7603084 7606522 - Mr. Wolf,<br />you gotta understand something.<br />- Winston, Jimmie, Winston.
7606584 7610112 Okay. You gotta<br />understand something, uh, Winston.
7610193 7612122 Uh-- Uh, no,<br />thank you.
7612194 7615322 Uh, this is<br />our best linen here,
7615393 7618332 and it's, uh--<br />it was a wedding present...
7618403 7620832 from my Uncle Conrad<br />and my Aunt Ginny.
7620903 7625341 - They're not with us anymore.<br />I wanna help--<br />- Let me ask you a question.
7625403 7628342 - If you don't mind.<br />- No, no, please. Go ahead.
7629913 7634812 Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,<br />were they millionaires ?
7635952 7637881 No.
7637952 7640381 Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.
7640452 7643910 And I'm positive that if<br />Uncle Conrad and Aunt...
7643991 7646420 - Ginny.<br />- Ginny were here,
7646491 7650759 they would furnish you<br />with a whole bedroom set,
7650831 7653959 which your Uncle Marsellus<br />is more than happy to do.
7657941 7661869 I like oak myself.<br />That's what I have in my bedroom.
7663010 7664939 How about you, Jimmie ?
7666181 7668110 You an oak man ?
7669211 7671150 Oak's nice.
7676989 7680857 Oh, man, I will never<br />forgive your ass for this shit.
7680929 7683358 This is some fucked-up,<br />repugnant shit.
7683430 7686858 Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy<br />that once a man admits he is wrong...
7686930 7689869 that he is immediately forgiven<br />for all wrongdoings ?
7689929 7692868 Get the fuck out my face<br />with that shit !
7692939 7695798 The motherfucker that said<br />that shit never had to pick up<br />itty-bitty pieces of skull...
7695869 7699637 - on account of your dumb ass.<br />- I got a threshold, Jules,<br />for the abuse that I will take.
7699708 7703306 Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,<br />and you got me in the red.
7703378 7706816 I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous<br />to have a race car in the fuckin' red.
7706878 7708817 That's all.<br />I could blow.
7708888 7710817 - Oh, you ready to blow ?<br />- Yeah.
7710888 7713817 Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'<br />motherfucker, motherfucker.
7713888 7716827 Every time my fingers touch brain,<br />I'm Superfly T.N.T.
7716887 7718826 I'm the Guns of the Navarone.
7718898 7721827 In fact, what the fuck<br />am I doin' in the back ?
7721897 7725125 You're the motherfucker should be on<br />brain detail ! We're fuckin' switchin'.
7725197 7727636 I'm washin' windows, and you're<br />pickin' up this nigger's skull!
7737417 7739346 Fine job, gentlemen.
7740687 7743116 You may get out of this yet.
7743186 7745615 I can't believe<br />this is the same car.
7745686 7749124 Well, let's not start suckin'<br />each other's dicks quite yet.
7749185 7752623 Phase one is complete-- Clean the car--<br />which moves us right along to Phase two:
7752695 7754624 Clean you two.
7756196 7758065 Strip.
7758135 7761893 - All the way ?<br />-  To your bare ass.
7761965 7765063 Quickly, gentlemen.<br />We got about 15 minutes...
7765135 7768074 before Jimmie's better half<br />comes pulling into the driveway.
7768145 7770634 Goddamn, this morning air<br />is some chilly shit.
7770714 7772663 Are you sure this is<br />absolutely necessary ?
7772795 7775094 - You know what you two look like ?<br />- What ?
7775164 7778602 Like a couple of guys<br />who just blew off somebody's head.
7778664 7782032 Strippin' off those bloody rags<br />is absolutely necessary.
7786344 7788813 Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.
7788873 7793311 Don't do nothin' stupid,<br />like leavin' this shit out front<br />for the garbageman to pick up.
7793383 7797611 Don't worry, we're taking it with us.<br />Jim, the soap.
7799053 7800992 - Vincent.<br />- Okay, gentlemen.
7801053 7804551 You both been to County before,<br />I'm sure. Here it comes.
7804622 7807561 - Goddamn ! The water's fuckin' cold !<br />- Yo ! Yo ! Yo !
7807633 7810861 Better you than me, gentlemen.
7810932 7813871 - Don't be afraid of the soap.<br />Spread it around.
7813932 7816801 - Get 'em there a little bit.<br />Vincent's hair.<br />- Hey, get out of my hair !
7816872 7819771 - Come on. Do it, goddamn it ! Do it !<br />- Uh, um--
7820842 7822771 Towel.
7833291 7836449 You're dry enough.<br />Toss 'em their clothes.
7836521 7839789 Perfect.
7839861 7843319 Perfect. We couldn't have<br />planned this better.
7843401 7845330 You guys look like--
7845401 7847830 What do they look like,<br />Jimmie ?
7847901 7851499 - Dorks. They look like<br />a couple of dorks.
7851570 7855058 - Ha-ha-ha. They're your<br />clothes, motherfucker.
7855139 7857868 Come on, gentlemen.<br />We're laughing our way<br />right into prison.
7857939 7859878 Don't make me beg.
7862950 7866378 Okay, gentlemen, let's get<br />our rules of the road straight.
7866450 7870008 We're going to a place<br />called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.
7870089 7873018 Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel<br />are sympathetic to our dilemma.
7873088 7874987 The place is North Hollywood,
7875059 7879047 so a few twists and turns aside,<br />we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.
7879129 7882457 Now, I'll drive the tainted car.<br />Jules, you ride with me.
7883869 7885798 Vincent, you follow<br />in my Acura.
7885868 7889806 Now, if we come across the path<br />of any John Q. Laws,
7889878 7892966 - nobody does a fuckin' thing<br />'til I do something.<br />- Right.
7893048 7895977 - What did I say ?<br />- Don't do shit unless.
7896047 7898306 - Unless what ?<br />- Unless you do it first.
7898378 7900817 Spoken like a true prodigy.
7900887 7904315 How about you, Lash LaRue?<br />Can you keep your spurs<br />from jingling and jangling?
7904387 7908485 The gun went off. I don't know why.<br />I'm cool. I promise you.
7908556 7911495 Fair enough. Now, I drive real<br />fuckin' fast, so keep up.
7911556 7914055 If get my car back<br />any different than I gave it,
7914126 7917065 Monster Joe's gonna be<br />disposing of two bodies.
7920906 7922595 Outta my way, Rex.
7924176 7926605 - We cool ?<br />- Like it never happened.
7926675 7930443 -  All right.<br />- Boys, this is Raquel.
7930515 7933134 Someday all this will be hers.
7933216 7936085 Hi. So, what's<br />with the outfits ?
7936155 7939583 - You guys going to<br />a volleyball game or something ?
7939655 7942084 I'm takin' milady<br />out for breakfast.
7942155 7944924 Maybe I could drop you two off.<br />Where do you live ?
7944994 7946353 - Redondo.<br />- Inglewood.
7946425 7949863 It's--<br />It's your future. I--
7949934 7952693 I see a--<br />a cab ride.
7952765 7955734 Move outta the sticks, fellas.<br />Say good night, Raquel.
7955805 7958734 - Good night, Raquel.<br />- I'll see you guys around.
7958804 7961243 Stay outta trouble,<br />you crazy kids.
7961304 7965242 Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was<br />a real pleasure watching you work.
7965313 7968242 Yeah, really.<br />And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.
7968314 7970243 Call me Winston.
7971813 7974752 - You see that, young lady ? Respect.
7974823 7979021 - Respect for one's elders<br />shows character.<br />- I have character.
7979093 7983121 - Because you are a character<br />doesn't mean that you have character.
7989702 7992631 - Wanna share a cab ?
7992702 7996970 - I'd go for some breakfast.<br />Feel like havin' breakfast with me ?
7997042 7999841 Cool.
8003882 8006970 I don't know why, I just thought<br />he'd be European or something.
8007051 8010489 - Yeah, he's about as European<br />as fuckin' English Bob.<br />- I know that now.
8010551 8012990 - But was he cool or what ?<br />- Thank you.
8013061 8015490 Totally fuckin' cool,<br />in control.
8015560 8019618 Didn't even really get pissed when you<br />were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.
8019700 8022289 - Want some bacon ?
8022361 8024300 No, man, I don't eat pork.
8024370 8027798 - Are you Jewish ?<br />- I ain't Jewish; I just don't<br />dig on swine, that's all.
8027870 8030809 - Why not ?<br />- Pigs are filthy animals.
8030870 8032809 I don't eat filthy animals.
8032880 8036308 Yeah, but bacon tastes good.<br />Pork chops taste good.
8036379 8039308 Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,<br />but I'd never know...
8039380 8042319 'cause I wouldn't eat<br />the filthy motherfuckers.
8042379 8045318 Pigs sleep and root in shit.<br />That's a filthy animal.
8045389 8049317 I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got<br />sense enough to disregard its own feces.
8049389 8053727 - What about a dog ?<br />Dog eats its own feces.<br />- I don't eat dog either.
8053799 8057127 Yeah, but do you consider<br />a dog to be a filthy animal ?
8057199 8060128 I wouldn't go so far<br />as to call a dog filthy,
8060198 8062137 but they're definitely dirty.
8062199 8066327 - But a dog's got personality.<br />Personality goes a long way.<br />- Ah, so, by that rationale,
8066408 8069966 if a pig had a better personality,<br />he would cease to be a filthy animal.
8070047 8073975 - Is that true ?<br />- We'd have to be talkin' about<br />one charming motherfuckin' pig.
8074047 8078075 I mean, he'd have to be<br />ten times more charming than<br />that Arnold on Green Acres.
8083687 8085816 Oh, man, that's good.
8085887 8089485 That's good, man.<br />You're startin' to lighten up.
8089567 8092555 You've been sittin' there,<br />all serious and shit.
8092636 8095065 - I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.<br />- About what ?
8095137 8098066 - About the miracle we witnessed.<br />- Miracle you witnessed.
8098137 8101405 - I witnessed a freak occurrence.<br />- What is a miracle, Vincent ?
8103306 8106504 - Act of God.<br />- And what's an act of God ?
8109985 8113813 When, um, God makes<br />the impossible possible.
8114855 8116784 But this morning...
8116855 8119584 - I don't think qualifies.<br />- Hey, Vincent.
8119655 8123353 See, that shit don't matter.<br />You're judging this shit the wrong way.
8123424 8128363 It could be God stopped the bullets,<br />changed Coke to Pepsi,<br />found my car keys.
8128435 8131423 You don't judge shit like this<br />based on merit.
8131504 8133933 Now, whether or not<br />what we experienced...
8134005 8137163 was an according-to-Hoyle miracle<br />is insignificant.
8137244 8141002 But what is significant is,<br />I felt the touch of God.
8141073 8143012 God got involved.
8143084 8144803 But why ?
8144883 8147901 Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:<br />I don't know why.
8147984 8150953 - But I can't go back to sleep.<br />- You're serious.
8151024 8152953 You're really thinkin'<br />about quittin'.
8153023 8155682 - For life ? Most definitely.<br />- Yeah.
8155753 8159121 Fuck.<br />What you gonna do then ?
8160433 8164661 Well, that's what I been<br />sitting here contemplating.
8164733 8168331 First I'm gonna deliver<br />this case to Marsellus.
8168402 8171490 Then, basically, I'm just<br />gonna walk the Earth.
8171572 8175010 - What you mean, "walk the Earth"?<br />- Like Caine in Kung Fu.
8175072 8178041 Walk from place to place,<br />meet people, get in adventures.
8178112 8180371 And how long do you intend<br />to walk the Earth ?
8180451 8183749 - 'Til God puts me<br />where He wants me to be.<br />- What if He don't do that ?
8183822 8188751 - If it takes forever,<br />then I'll walk forever.<br />- So you decided to be a bum.
8188821 8192479 I'll just be Jules, Vincent.<br />No more, no less.
8192561 8194530 No, Jules,<br />you decided to be a bum,
8194590 8197888 just like all those pieces of shit<br />out there who beg for change,
8197960 8200899 who sleep in garbage bins,<br />eat what I throw away.
8200971 8203940 They got a name for that, Jules.<br />It's called a bum.
8204000 8207668 And without a job,<br />a residence or legal tender,<br />that's what you're gonna be, man.
8207740 8209669 You're gonna be<br />a fuckin' bum.
8209740 8212679 Look, my friend,<br />this is just where you and I differ.
8212749 8215578 GarÃ§on ! Coffee !
8215649 8220138 Jules, look, what happened this morning,<br />man, I agree it was peculiar.
8220220 8223348 - But water into wine, l--<br />- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.
8223420 8226518 - Don't fuckin' talk<br />to me that way, man.<br />- If my answers frighten you,
8226589 8229188 then you should cease<br />asking scary questions.
8232059 8233998 I'm gonna take a shit.
8236869 8240617 Let me ask you something.
8240749 8242878 When did you make this decision ?<br />When you were sittin' there<br />eatin' that muffin ?
8242948 8246886 Yeah. I was sittin' here<br />eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,
8246958 8248887 replayin' the incident<br />in my head,
8248958 8252756 when I had what alcoholics refer to<br />as a moment of clarity.
8252827 8255955 Fuck. To be continued.
8267977 8270906 - I love you, Pumpkin.<br />- I love you, Honey Bunny.
8272517 8275446 - Everybody be cool !<br />This is a robbery !
8275516 8280505 Any one of you fucking pricks move,<br />and I'll execute every one<br />of you motherfuckers !

8315784 8318723 - You gonna give me a problem ?<br />- No, sir, I'm not.
8318793 8322811 Thought you said you were gonna<br />give me a fucking problem !
8322893 8327592 - I think we got<br />a hero here, Honey Bunny.<br />- Well, just execute him !
8327663 8329602 - I am not a hero.
8329664 8332692 - I'm just a coffee shop manager.<br />- Get the fuck down !
8332773 8334532 The restaurant's ours !
8334603 8337542 - Just take whatever you want.
8337612 8339541 - You talk to the customers.<br />- Yeah.
8339612 8342740 You tell them to be fucking cool<br />and everything will be over.
8342813 8344782 - You understand me ?<br />- Yes !
8347083 8348882 Listen, everybody.
8348952 8350981 Be calm, cooperate,

8380721 8384309 That's it.<br />Get the fuck down. In the bag.
8384390 8387319 - In the fucking bag !<br />- I don't<br />have nothin' on me, man.
8387390 8389249 In the bag.
8389320 8392259 What am I waiting for ?<br />ln the fucking bag.
8392330 8395259 Laura. Laura. Tips.<br />In the bag.
8395329 8397558 - Is that a cellular phone ?<br />- Yeah.
8397630 8399569 In the fucking bag.
8401140 8404588 Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.<br />Now get the fuck down on the floor.
8404669 8407108 In the bag.<br />In the bag.
8419289 8421218 In the bag.
8436338 8439267 - What's in the case ?<br />- My boss's dirty laundry.
8439337 8441866 - Your boss makes you do his laundry ?<br />- When he wants it clean.
8441937 8444636 - Sounds like a shit job.<br />- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.
8444706 8447645 - Open it.<br />- 'Fraid I can't do that.
8449677 8452046 - I didn't hear you.<br />- Yes, you did.
8453116 8455445 What's going on ?
8455516 8458974 - Looks like we got<br />a vigilante in our midst.<br />- Shoot him in the face !
8459056 8462784 I hate to shatter your ego,<br />but this ain't the first time<br />I've had a gun pointed at me.
8462855 8466263 - If you don't take your hand off<br />that case, it'll be your last.<br />- Stop causing problems !
8466325 8469124 You'll get us all killed ! Give 'em<br />what you got and get 'em outta here !
8469196 8473434 Shut the fuck up, fat man ! This ain't<br />none of your goddamn business !
8473505 8475734 Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.
8475805 8477894 No problem.<br />I got it under control.
8479474 8481463 Now, I'm gonna count to three.
8483074 8487012 If you don't open that case,<br />I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.
8491424 8493353 We clear ?
8496494 8498423 One.
8500263 8502782 Two.
8502863 8504922 - Three.<br />- Okay, Ringo.
8505004 8507063 You win.
8507133 8509072 It's yours.
8513103 8515832 - Open it.
8519712 8521941 Hey, what is it ?
8522013 8524352 What is it ?
8524422 8527011 Is that what I think it is ?
8527082 8529781 Mm-hmm.
8531362 8533481 It's beautiful.
8533561 8536120 Goddamn it, what is it ?
8537601 8540530 You let him go !<br />You let him go !
8540602 8543571 - Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you !<br />- Tell that bitch to be cool.
8543632 8546571 - Say, "Bitch, be cool !"<br />Say, "Bitch, be cool !"<br />- Be cool ! Be cool !
8546641 8549370 - Tell that bitch to chill !<br />- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad !
8549441 8552340 - Chill that fuckin' bitch out !<br />- Chill out, Honey Bunny !
8552411 8554210 - Let go of him !<br />- Chill out, Honey Bunny !
8554280 8557209 - Now, promise her<br />it's gonna be all right !<br />- I promise !
8557281 8559180 - Tell her to chill !<br />- Chill out, Honey Bunny !
8559251 8561180 - Now tell me her name.<br />- Yolanda.
8561251 8564689 All right, now, Yolanda, we're not<br />gonna do anything stupid, are we ?
8564760 8567689 - Don't you hurt him !<br />- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody !
8567760 8571248 We're all gonna be like three little<br />Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like ?
8571330 8574988 - Come on, Yolanda !<br />What's Fonzie like ?<br />- He's cool.
8575070 8576999 - What ?<br />- Cool.
8577070 8579899 Correctamundo.<br />And that's what we're gonna be.
8579970 8581909 We're gonna be cool.
8581969 8586878 Now, Ringo,<br />I'm gonna count to three.
8586938 8589037 And when I count three,
8589109 8592048 I want you to<br />let go of your gun,
8592118 8595566 put your palms flat on the table<br />and sit your ass down.
8596648 8598707 And when you do it,
8598788 8600847 you do it cool.
8600928 8603257 You ready ?
8603328 8605417 One,
8605497 8607686 two,
8607767 8609696 three.
8616667 8619795 -  Okay, now you let him go !<br />- Yolanda !
8619877 8623465 I thought you were gonna<br />be cool. Now, when you yell<br />at me, it makes me nervous.
8623547 8625636 When I get nervous,<br />I get scared.
8625716 8629544 When motherfuckers get scared,<br />that's when motherfuckers<br />accidentally get shot.
8631186 8634814 Just know, you hurt him, you die.
8634886 8638284 Well, that seems to be<br />the situation.
8638356 8640295 But I don't want that.
8640355 8642294 And you don't want that.
8642366 8645095 And Ringo here definitely<br />doesn't want that.
8645165 8647254 So let's see what we can do.
8649665 8652903 Now... here's the situation.
8652975 8656843 Normally both your asses would be<br />dead as fuckin' fried chicken,
8656905 8660343 but you happened to pull this shit<br />while I'm in a transitional period,
8660415 8663344 and I don't wanna kill you;<br />I wanna help you.
8663414 8667352 But I can't give you this case,<br />'cause it don't belong to me.
8667424 8670353 Besides, I been through too much shit<br />over this case this morning...
8670424 8673353 to just hand it over<br />to your dumb ass.
8673424 8675293 - Vincent !
8675364 8678293 - Be cool ! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.<br />- Get back !
8678364 8681063 It's cool !<br />We still just talkin'.
8681133 8685291 - Come on. Point the gun at me.<br />Point the gun at me. There you go.
8685373 8687432 Now, Vincent, you just hang back...
8687503 8689442 and don't do<br />a goddamn thing.
8689503 8691442 Tell her it's still cool.
8691513 8694442 - It's still cool, Honey Bunny.<br />- How we doin', baby ?
8695843 8698512 I-- I gotta go pee.
8698582 8700511 I wanna go home.
8700583 8704181 Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.<br />And Ringo's proud of you.
8704253 8707192 It's almost over.<br />Tell her you're proud of her.
8707252 8710620 - I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.<br />- I love you.
8710692 8713850 - I love you too, Honey Bunny.<br />- Now,
8713932 8717860 I want you to go in that bag<br />and find my wallet.
8720401 8724339 - Which one is it ?<br />- It's the one that says<br />"Bad Motherfucker."
8738600 8741159 That's it.<br />That's my bad motherfucker.
8741230 8744328 Open it up.<br />Take out the money.
8749380 8751539 Count it.
8757850 8760379 How much is there ?
8762289 8764218 About 1,500 dollars.
8764289 8767487 Okay, put it in your pocket.<br />It's yours.
8767559 8770757 Now, with the rest<br />of those wallets and the register,
8770829 8772918 that makes this a pretty successful<br />little score, huh ?
8772999 8776897 Jules, you give that fuckin'<br />nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll<br />shoot him on general principle.
8776968 8780406 No, Yolanda ! Yolanda ! He ain't gonna<br />do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing !
8780468 8782567 Vince, shut the fuck up !
8782637 8786505 - Shut up !<br />- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.
8786577 8789506 Now, I ain't givin' it<br />to him, Vincent.
8789578 8791517 I'm buyin' something<br />for my money.
8792747 8795945 - Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo ?<br />- What ?
8796017 8800756 Your life. I'm givin' you that money<br />so I don't have to kill your ass.
8800826 8803515 You read the Bible, Ringo ?
8804596 8806525 Not regularly, no.
8806597 8809026 Well, there's this passage<br />I got memorized.
8809097 8812625 Ezekiel 25:17.
8812706 8815535 "The path of the righteous man<br />is beset on all sides...
8815606 8817535 by the inequities<br />of the selfish...
8817606 8819535 and the tyranny of evil men.
8819605 8822973 Blessed is he who,<br />in the name of charity and good will,
8823045 8825474 shepherds the weak<br />through the valley of darkness,
8825546 8829644 for he is truly his brother's keeper<br />and the finder of lost children.
8829716 8834014 And I will strike down upon thee with<br />great vengeance and furious anger...
8834085 8837143 those who attempt to poison<br />and destroy My brothers.
8837224 8840252 And you will know<br />I am the Lord...
8840324 8843882 when I lay My vengeance<br />upon you."
8844965 8847404 I been sayin' that shit for years,
8847465 8850633 and if you heard it,<br />that meant your ass.
8850704 8853643 I never gave much thought<br />to what it meant.
8853704 8856643 I just thought it was some coldblooded<br />shit to say to a motherfucker...
8856714 8859143 before I popped a cap<br />in his ass.
8859213 8862641 But I saw some shit this morning<br />made me think twice.
8862714 8865653 See, now I'm thinkin'<br />maybe it means...
8865724 8870583 you're the evil man,<br />and I'm the righteous man,
8870653 8873592 and Mr. 9-millimeter here,<br />he's the shepherd...
8873663 8877221 protecting my righteous ass<br />in the valley of darkness.
8877292 8879231 Or it could mean...
8879303 8882731 you're the righteous man,<br />and I'm the shepherd,
8882803 8886741 and it's the world<br />that's evil and selfish.
8886802 8889071 Now, I'd like that.
8889142 8892041 But that shit<br />ain't the truth.
8892112 8893971 The truth is,
8895041 8896980 you're the weak...
8898382 8901780 and I'm the tyranny<br />of evil men.
8903191 8905120 But I'm tryin', Ringo.
8906391 8909320 I'm tryin' real hard...
8909391 8911660 to be the shepherd.
8926980 8928909 Go.
8946598 8949027 I think we should be<br />leaving now.
8949100 8952029 - Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
