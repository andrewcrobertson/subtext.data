1093051 1094094 Ah.
1094178 1095888 Dr. Doppler, I presume?
1096013 1097806 Uh, um... Yes. I...
1097890 1101059 - Hello! Can you hear me?<br />- Yes, I can! Stop that banging!
1101143 1103645 If I may, Doctor,<br />this works so much better
1103729 1106815 -when it's right-way up and plugged in.<br />- Ooh!
1106899 1107983 Lovely. There you go.
1108066 1110778 If you don't mind,<br />I can manage my own plugging!
1110861 1111945 I'm Captain Amelia,
1112029 1113572 late of a few run-ins<br />with the Protean Armada.
1113655 1115949 Nasty business, but I won't<br />bore you with my scars.
1116241 1118076 You've met my first officer, Mr. Arrow.
1118160 1120287 Sterling, tough, dependable,<br />honest, brave, and true.
1120370 1121580 Please, Captain.
1121663 1123582 Shut up, Arrow. You know<br />I don't mean a word of it.
1123665 1127211 Ahem. Excuse me. I hate to<br />interrupt this lovely banter,
1127294 1129588 but may I introduce to you<br />Jim Hawkins?
1129671 1132800 Jim, you see, is the boy<br />who found the treasure...
1132883 1134384 Doctor, please!
1135219 1136470 (GROWLS)
1137888 1140015 I'd like a word with you in my stateroom.
1141892 1146730 Doctor, to muse and blabber<br />about a treasure map
1147105 1149358 in front of this particular crew
1149441 1151527 demonstrates a level of ineptitude
1151610 1153612 that borders on the imbecilic,
1153695 1155489 and I mean that in a very caring way.
1155572 1158659 "Imbecilic," did you say?<br />Foolishness, I've...
1158742 1160410 May I see the map, please?
1166959 1167960 Here.
1169211 1170212 Hmm.
1170295 1171588 Fascinating.
1173173 1175008 Mr. Hawkins, in the future,
1175092 1177052 you will address me<br />as "Captain" or "ma'am."
1177135 1178136 Is that clear?
1178595 1180138 Ugh...
1180931 1182015 Mr. Hawkins?
1183267 1185394 - Yes, ma'am.<br />- That'll do.
1186311 1187980 Gentlemen, this must be kept<br />under lock and key
1188063 1191483 when not in use. And, Doctor, again,
1191567 1193360 with the greatest possible respect,
1193443 1195404 zip your howling screamer.
1195487 1196655 Captain, I assure you I...
1196738 1200325 Let me make this<br />as monosyllabic as possible.
1200409 1204955 I don't much care<br />for this crew you hired.
1205038 1206999 They're... How did<br />I describe them, Arrow?
1207082 1209585 I said something rather good<br />this morning before coffee.
1209668 1213797 "A ludicrous parcel<br />of driveling galoots," ma'am.
1213881 1217342 - There you go. Poetry.<br />- Now, see here...
1217426 1221513 Doctor, I'd love to chat,<br />tea, cake, the whole shebang,
1221597 1222764 but I have a ship to launch,
1222848 1224850 and you've got your outfit to buff up.
1225267 1227561 Mr. Arrow, please escort<br />these two neophytes
1227644 1228896 down to the galley straightaway.
1228979 1231648 Young Hawkins will be working<br />for our cook, Mr. Silver.
1231732 1233650 What? The cook?
1235444 1237988 That woman! That feline!
1238071 1239907 Who does she think<br />is working for whom?
1239990 1242034 It's my map,<br />and she's got me bussin' tables?
1242117 1245871 I'll not tolerate a cross word<br />about our captain!
1245954 1249917 There's no finer officer<br />in this or any galaxy.
1250208 1252210 (WHISTLING)
1253503 1254755 ARROW; Mr. Silver?
1254838 1256882 Why, Mr. Arrow, sir.
1257507 1260052 Bringin' in such fine<br />and distinguished gents
1260135 1261595 to grace my humble galley.
1261678 1263847 Had I known,<br />I'd have tucked in me shirt.
1264389 1265724 (CHUCKUNG)
1269269 1270354 A cyborg!
1270687 1272940 May I introduce Dr. Doppler,
1273023 1275067 the financier of our voyage.
1275567 1277778 Love the outfit, Doc.
1277861 1280739 Well, thank you. Um, love the eye.
1281198 1283533 Uh, this young lad is Jim Hawkins.
1284534 1285702 Jimbo!
1291833 1296129 Now, don't be too put off<br />by this hunk of hardware.
1296964 1298423 (HUMMING)
1302052 1303136 Whoa!
1303720 1306056 These gears have been<br />tough getting used to,
1306139 1309518 but they do come in mighty handy<br />from time to time.
1318068 1319152 Mmm!
1319861 1324241 Here, now, have a taste<br />of me famous bonzabeast stew.
1324741 1326076 (SNIFFING)
1327786 1331790 Mmm! Delightfully tangy, yet robust.
1331873 1334334 SILVER: Old family recipe.
1334418 1335544 Aah!
1335627 1338839 In fact, that was part of the old family!
1338922 1341008 (LAUGHS)
1343385 1344803 I'm just kiddin', Doc!
1344886 1346680 Yeah, well...
1346763 1349182 I'm nothin' if I ain't a kidder.
1349266 1351268 Go on, Jimbo. Have a swig.
1357065 1358275 (GIGGLING)
1358608 1360027 SILVER: Morph!
1360444 1363238 You jiggle-headed blob of mischief!
1363321 1365407 So that's where you was hiding!
1366283 1367367 (CHATTERING)
1367451 1368702 (BELCH)
1372456 1373665 What is that thing?
1373749 1374750 "What is that thing?"
1374833 1376710 SILVER: He's a morph.
1376918 1379796 I rescued the little shape-shifter<br />on Proteus 1.
1380380 1381798 (COOING)
1381882 1384176 Aw, he took a shine to me.
1384259 1386511 We been together ever since.
1386636 1389056 Right? Yeah. Nice boy.
1389389 1390891 We're about to get underway.
1390974 1393060 Would you like to observe<br />the launch, Doctor?
1393143 1394186 Would I?
1394269 1397314 Does an active galactic nucleus<br />have superluminal jets?
1398523 1400025 I'll follow you.
1400108 1404613 Mr. Hawkins will stay here<br />in your charge, Mr. Silver.
1404696 1405739 (COUGHING)
1405822 1407699 Beggin' your pardon, sir, but...
1407991 1412496 Captain's orders! See to it<br />the new cabin boy's kept busy.
1412829 1415499 - But, no, but...<br />- No, you can't...
1416249 1417459 (BOTH SIGH)
1420295 1424091 So, Captain's put you with me, eh?
1424174 1425467 Whatever.
1427719 1431181 Well, who be a humble cyborg<br />to argue with a captain?
1432349 1433475 Yeah.
1434267 1436603 You know, these purps,
1436686 1440816 they're kind of like the ones<br />back home on Montressor.
1441399 1442526 You ever been there?
1442859 1445237 I can't say as I have, Jimbo.
1447322 1449741 Come to think of it, just before I left,
1449825 1451535 I met this old guy who was, um...
1452119 1455288 He was kind of looking<br />for a cyborg buddy of his.
1455372 1456373 Is that so?
1456581 1457707 Yeah.
1458458 1461128 What was that old salamander's name?
1462003 1464005 Oh, yeah. Bones.
1464714 1466174 Billy Bones?
1466258 1469010 Bones? Bones?
1470178 1472013 T'ain't ringin' any bells.
1472097 1474015 Must have been a different cyborg.
1474099 1477477 There's a slew of cyborgs<br />roamin' this port.
1477561 1480522 -(WHISTLE ON DECK)<br />- ARROW: Prepare to cast off!
1481106 1484776 Off with you, lad, and watch the launch.
1484860 1488321 There'll be plenty work<br />a-waitin' for you afterwards.
1488697 1490490 -(HUMMING)<br />-(CHATTERING)
1493618 1498165 We best be keepin' a sharp eye<br />on this one, eh, Morph?
1499457 1503420 We wouldn't want him strayin'<br />into things he shouldn't.
1504379 1506715 We're all clear, Captain!
1507132 1510093 Well, my friend. Are we ready<br />to raise this creaking tub?
1510510 1512304 My pleasure, Captain.
1512637 1515265 All hands to stations!
1516683 1517851 Smartly now!
1517934 1520645 Come on, you scurvy scum!<br />I'll race you!
1523148 1526193 Loose all solar sails!
1530280 1531323 (GRUNTING)
1531406 1532741 Come on!
1538079 1540415 ARROW: Heave up the braces.
1541458 1542834 Brace up.
1557015 1558558 Ooh! Oh!
1558642 1561436 Mr. Zoff, engage artificial gravity.
1561561 1563104 (FARTING)
1565690 1566733 (CLANKING)
1566816 1568526 (CLATTERING)
1568985 1572197 South by southwest,<br />Mr. Turnbuckle, heading 2-1-0-0.
1572530 1574991 Aye, Captain. 2-1 -0-0.
1577744 1579871 Full speed, Mr. Arrow, if you please.
1579955 1580997 Take her away!
1585293 1587087 Brace yourself, Doctor.
1587170 1588296 (SNIDELY) "Brace yourself."
1589256 1590715 Aah! Oof!
1610485 1611486 Whoa.
1611569 1612988 (CALLING)
1628586 1632590 Upon my word, an Orcus Galacticus.
1634426 1635468 Smile.
1635552 1637262 Doctor, I'd stand clear...
1642392 1645061 'Tis a grand day for sailing, Captain,
1645145 1646271 and look at you.
1646771 1649232 You're as trim and as bonny as a sloop
1649316 1651860 with new sails and a fresh coat of paint.
1652152 1653820 You can keep that kind of flim-flammery
1653903 1655488 for your spaceport floozies, Silver.
1655572 1657115 "Spaceport floozy, spaceport floozy..."
1657198 1659492 You cut me to the quick, Captain.
1660076 1662662 I speaks nothing<br />but me heart at all times.
1662746 1663830 MORPH: "Nothing but me heart."
1664622 1666666 And, by the way,<br />isn't that your cabin boy
1667000 1670295 aimlessly footling about<br />in those shrouds?
1670503 1671921 Yep, it...
1672255 1677177 A momentary aberration, Cap'n,<br />soon to be addressed. Jimbo!
1678428 1681931 I got two new friends<br />I'd like you to meet.
1683266 1687645 Say hello to Mr. Mop and Mrs. Bucket.
1687937 1689689 (LAUGHING)
1689856 1691066 Yippie.
1693151 1695570 Yeah, I got your Mr. Mop.
1698865 1701159 Watch it, twerp.
1703620 1707332 (MURMURING)
1715090 1717801 What are you looking at, weirdo?
1718843 1720804 Yeah, weirdo.
1721429 1723556 (HISSING)
1724599 1730980 Cabin boys should learn<br />to mind their own business.
1731314 1733483 Why? You got something to hide,<br />bright eyes?
1735485 1739823 Maybe your ears don't work so well.
1739906 1741282 (GRUNTS) Yeah. Ahem.
1741908 1743993 Too bad my nose works just fine.
1744077 1747122 Why, you impudent little...
1748039 1749833 (CREW SHOUTING)
1750041 1753545 - Go ahead! Slice him! Dice him!<br />-(FARTING NOISE)
1753962 1757674 Any last words, cabin boy?
1760093 1761469 Mr. Scroop,
1764180 1767100 you ever see what happens<br />to a fresh purp
1767183 1770395 when you squeeze real hard?
1772939 1774441 ARROW: What's all this, then?
1778403 1779946 You know the rules.
1780029 1782407 There'll be no brawling on this ship.
1782532 1783700 Aye-aye, sir.
1783783 1787620 Any further offenders<br />will be confined to the brig
1787704 1789873 for the remainder of the voyage.
1790748 1793626 Am I clear, Mr. Scroop?
1800133 1802135 Transparently.
1807724 1810310 SILVER: Well done, Mr. Arrow, sir!
1810393 1813271 A tight ship's a happy ship, sir.
1814647 1817108 Jimbo, I gave you a job.
1817192 1819486 Hey, I was doing it until that bug thing...
1819569 1825033 Belay that! Now, I want<br />this deck swabbed spotless,
1825116 1828411 and heaven help you<br />if I come back and it's not done.
1829037 1832540 Morph? Keep an eye on this pup,
1832624 1834459 and let me know if there be<br />any more distractions.
1834542 1836085 Okay. Aye-aye-
1837128 1838880 (CHATTERING)
1838963 1840131 (SIGHS)
1842091 1843468 (CREW GRUMBLING)
1845303 1847764 So, we're all here, then.
1847847 1850433 - Excuse me.<br />- Fine.
1852268 1856814 Now, if you pardon<br />my plain speaking, gentlemen,
1857398 1858858 are you all
1858942 1863863 -stark-raving, totally blinking daft?<br />-(CHATTERS)
1864197 1866282 After all me finagling getting us hired
1866366 1868034 as an upstanding crew,
1868117 1871579 you want to blow the whole mutiny<br />before its time?
1872121 1874582 The boy was sniffing about.
1874999 1879462 You just stick to the plan,<br />you bug-brained twit.
1880296 1883967 As for the boy, I'll run him so ragged,
1884050 1886177 he won't have time to think.
1889389 1891224 (MORPH LAUGHS)
1893268 1894394 (COUGHS)
1895270 1896437 (SIGHS)
1897063 1899315 Well, this has been a fun day, huh?
1899691 1903653 Making new friends,<br />like that spider psycho.
1904112 1905863 "Spider psycho, spider psycho."
1905947 1908199 Heh. A little uglier.
1908283 1909826 (LAUGHS MANIACALLY)
1910493 1911661 Pretty close.
1911744 1912745 SILVER: Well,
1913204 1916374 thank heavens for little miracles.
1916457 1917584 Up here for an hour,
1917667 1919669 and the deck's still in one piece.
1920420 1921421 Um...
1921504 1923131 Look,L“
1924841 1926301 What you did...
1928678 1929846 Thanks.
1932015 1933600 Didn't your pop ever teach you
1933683 1936019 to pick your fights a bit more carefully?
1941524 1943776 Your father not the teachin' sort?
1944694 1945737 No.
1946070 1949824 He was more the taking off<br />and never coming back sort.
1950617 1951701 Oh.
1954829 1956039 Sorry, lad.
1956456 1959500 Hey, no big deal. I'm doing just fine.
1960752 1962128 Is that so?
1963713 1967300 Well, since the captain<br />has put you in my charge,
1967383 1969427 like it or not, I'll be pounding a few skills
1969510 1972055 into that thick head of yours<br />to keep you out of trouble.
1972138 1973181 - What?<br />- From now on,
1973264 1975433 I'm not letting you out of me sight.
1975516 1976517 You can't do...
1976601 1978603 You won't so much as eat, sleep,
1978686 1981731 or scratch your bum without my say-so.
1981814 1982899 Don't do me any favors!
1982982 1985568 You can be sure of that, my lad.
1986235 1987987 You can be sure of that.
1988071 1989906 (LAUGHS)
1994285 1996579 Put some elbow into it.
2007423 2011469 <i>I am a question to the world</i>

2215756 2219260 If I could maneuver a skiff<br />like that when I was your age,

3369659 3370952 lam, um...
3371453 3373788 My name is, uh...
3375957 3377459 (CUCKOOING)
3379085 3380920 B.E.N.! Of course, I'm B.E.N.
3381004 3383757 Bioelectronic Navigator. Oops.
3383965 3385592 - And you are?<br />- Jim.
3385675 3387510 Oh, what a pleasure<br />to meet you, Jimmy.
3387594 3389345 - It's Jim.<br />- Anyway...
3389429 3390680 Look, I'm kind of in a hurry, okay?
3391097 3393725 I got to find a place to hide,<br />and there's pirates chasing me.
3393808 3396394 Pirates! Don't get me started on pirates!
3396478 3399647 I don't like them.<br />I remember Captain Flint.
3400106 3401983 This guy had such a temper.
3402317 3404235 Wait, wait, wait.<br />You knew Captain Flint?
3404319 3407238 I think he suffered<br />from mood swings, personally.
3407322 3409074 I'm not a therapist, and anyway,
3409157 3410992 but I... You let me know<br />when I'm rambling.
3411284 3412577 But that means... But wait.
3412660 3414829 But then you gotta know<br />about the treasure?
3415163 3416456 - Treasure?<br />- Yeah, Flint's trove?
3416539 3418917 You know, loot of a thousand worlds.
3419000 3420794 It's, well...
3420877 3424047 lt'$ all a little... Little... Little fuzzy.
3424589 3427467 Wait. I... I remember.
3428343 3429761 I do. I... Treasure!
3429844 3432764 Lots of treasure buried in the centroid...
3432931 3434849 Centroid... Centroid of the mechanism.
3435100 3438269 And there was this big door<br />opening and closing,
3438353 3440438 and opening and closing,
3440522 3441773 and Captain Flint wanted to make sure
3441856 3443191 nobody could ever get to his treasure,
3443274 3445860 So I helped him. (SPLUTTERING)
3447112 3449823 Aah! Data inaccessible! Reboot!
3449906 3451616 JIM: B.E.N.? B.E.N.? B.E.N.!
3451699 3454035 Reboot! Aah! And you are?
3454160 3455453 Wait, wait, wait!<br />What about the treasure?
3455703 3456955 I want to say Larry.
3457038 3459457 The centroid of the mechanism, or...
3459541 3462168 I'm sorry. My memory<br />isn't what it used to be.
3462377 3464295 I've lost my mind.
3464379 3467090 I've lost my mind.<br />You haven't found it, have you?
3467173 3470635 My missing piece?<br />My primary memory circuit?
3471052 3475140 Look, B.E.N., I really need<br />to find a place to hide, okay?
3475223 3478810 So I'm just gonna be,<br />you know, moving on.
3479561 3480854 Oh, uh...
3481062 3482939 So, well, then,
3483022 3486192 I guess this is good-bye, huh?
3487068 3491030 I'm sorry that I'm so dysfunctional.
3492282 3496536 So, uh, go ahead and... I do understand.
3496911 3499581 I do. Bye-bye.
3501624 3502750 (WHINES)
3503251 3504294 (SIGHS)
3504377 3506004 Look, if you're gonna come along,
3506087 3507422 you're gonna have to stop talking.
3507589 3509799 Huzzah! Ha, ha, ha!
3509924 3511509 Oh, this is fantastic!
3511593 3514470 Me and my best buddy<br />out lookin' for a...
3515305 3516514 (CLEARS THROAT)
3517098 3518516 (WHISPERING) Being quiet.
3518600 3521102 And you have to stop touching me.
3521186 3524772 Touching and talking.<br />That's my two big no-nos.
3524856 3526983 Okay. Now, I think that we should...
3527066 3530653 Say, listen, before we go out<br />on our big search,
3530737 3534782 would you mind if we made a quick<br />pit stop at my place? (CHUCKLES)
3535033 3536576 Kind of urgent.
3536701 3540330 JIM: B.E.N., I think<br />you just solved my problem.
3544792 3545919 B.E.N.: Pardon the mess, people.
3546336 3547462 You'd think in 100 years
3547545 3549005 I would've dusted a little more often,
3549088 3551341 but, you know, when you're batchin' it,
3551424 3554010 you tend to let things go.
3554427 3556137 Aw. Isn't that sweet?
3556554 3559474 I find old-fashioned romance<br />so touching, don't you?
3559807 3561809 How about drinks for the happy couple?
3562518 3564229 Oh, uh, ooh. Uh, no.
3564312 3565647 Thank you, we don't drink,
3565730 3567774 and we're not a couple.
3569901 3570985 Ahem.
3571069 3573112 Look at these markings.
3573196 3575990 They're identical<br />to the ones on the map.
3576074 3578076 I suspect these are<br />the hieroglyphic remnants
3578159 3579953 of an ancient culture.
3580036 3581162 CAPTAIN AMELIA; Mr. Hawkins,
3581496 3584123 stop anyone who tries to approach. Ohh!
3584207 3586251 Yes, yes. Now listen to me,
3586334 3589879 stop giving orders for<br />a few milliseconds and lie still.
3590505 3592173 Very forceful, Doctor.
3592590 3594008 Go on. Say something else.
3595551 3597553 Hey, look! There's<br />some more of your buddies!
3597804 3600598 Hey, fellas! We're over here, fellas!
3600682 3602892 Oh! Uhh! Ooh! Ohh!
3606521 3609524 SILVER: Stop wastin' your fire!
3610942 3613528 Hello, up there!
3616531 3617699 Jimbo?
3618283 3621452 If it's all right with the captain,
3621536 3624080 I'd like a short word with ya.
3624622 3627667 No tricks, just a little palaver.
3628042 3630878 Come to bargain for the map,<br />doubtless.
3630962 3632046 Pestilential...
3632130 3633464 - Ugh!<br />- Captain.
3634090 3638678 That means that he thinks<br />we still have it.
3645018 3649397 Morphy! I wondered where you lit off to.
3650648 3652567 (GROANING)
3653985 3654986 Ooh.
3655486 3658489 Oh, this poor old leg's downright snarky,
3658573 3661242 since that game attack<br />we had in the galley. (CHUCKLES)
3664078 3665079 Ahh.
3667498 3670251 Whatever you heard back there,
3670335 3672253 at least the part concerning you,
3673421 3676090 I didn't mean a word of it.
3676632 3680678 If that bloodthirsty lot<br />had thought I'd gone soft,
3680762 3682722 they'd have gutted us both.
3686017 3689687 Listen to me. If we play our cards right,
3689771 3694984 we can both walk away<br />from this rich as kings.
3695151 3697111 - Yeah?<br />-(CHUCKLES)
3697195 3701824 You get me that map,
3702533 3706954 and an even portion<br />of the treasure is yours.
3712502 3713586 B03'-
3715254 3717256 You are really something.
3718216 3720718 All that talk of greatness,
3720802 3724097 light coming off my sails, what a joke.
3724180 3725723 Now, just see here, Jimbo...
3725807 3726974 I mean, at least<br />you taught me one thing.
3727058 3728393 Stick to it, right?
3729018 3730311 Well, that's just what I'm gonna do.
3730770 3732230 I'm gonna make sure that you never see
3732313 3734649 one drabloon of my treasure!
3734941 3738319 That treasure is owed me, by thunder!
3738403 3742698 Well, try to find it<br />without my map, by thunder!
3743699 3747829 Oh, you still don't know how to<br />pick your fights, do you, boy?
3748663 3750415 Now, mark me.
3751624 3754961 Either I get that map by dawn tomorrow,
3755336 3759173 or so help me,<br />I'll use the ship's cannons
3759507 3762844 to blast ya all to kingdom come!
3764178 3766097 Morph, hop to it.
3768057 3769142 Now!
3771519 3773312 Oh, blast it!
3784991 3786617 Gentlemen,
3787577 3790746 we must stay together and...
3790997 3792206 And...
3792331 3794375 - Ohh.<br />- And What? What?
3794459 3796794 We must stay together and what?
3797211 3802258 Doctor, you have wonderful eyes.
3802592 3804051 She's lost her mind!
3804135 3805344 Well, you gotta help her.
3805511 3807972 Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer,<br />not a doctor.
3808055 3809849 I mean, I am a doctor,<br />but I'm not that kind of doctor.
3809932 3811976 I have a doctorate.<br />It's not the same thing.
3812059 3813311 You can't help people with a doctorate.
3813394 3815897 You just sit there, and you're useless.
3816105 3817565 It's okay, Doc.
3818441 3819984 It's all right.
3820359 3823696 Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows<br />exactly how to get out of this.
3823779 3826324 It's just Jimmy<br />has this knowledge of things.
3827241 3829535 Jim, any thoughts at all?
3831162 3833289 Without the map, we're dead.
3834457 3836751 If we try to leave, we're dead.
3837752 3839253 - If we stay here...<br />-"We're dead!
3839337 3841255 "We're dead! We're dead!"
3845760 3849514 Well, I think that Jimmy<br />could use a little quiet time. Heh.
3850139 3852642 So I'll just slip out the back door.
3853267 3854810 - Back door?<br />- Oh, yeah.
3854894 3857730 I get this delightful breeze through here,
3857813 3858940 which I think is important,
3859023 3860525 because ventilation among friends...
3860608 3863152 JIM: Whoa. What is all this stuff?
3863236 3865029 B.E.N.: You mean the miles and miles<br />of machinery that run
3865112 3867281 through the entire course<br />of the inside of this planet?
3867949 3868991 Not a clue.
3869325 3871452 Hey, Doc! Doc! I think<br />I found a way out of here!
3871619 3873996 No, no. Jim, wait.<br />The captain ordered us to stay...
3874080 3876832 - I'll be back.<br />- Cannonball!
3877375 3878459 Woof.
3879335 3881295 (SNORING)
3886968 3889887 - So, what's the plan?<br />- Shh. B.E.N., quiet.
3893766 3895059 (WHISPERING) Okay, here it is.
3895142 3898062 We sneak back to the <i>Legacy,</i><br />disable the laser cannons,
3898145 3900064 and bring back the map.
3900147 3901357 (MUFFLED) That's a good plan.
3901440 3902733 I like that plan. The only thing is,
3902817 3905319 I'm wondering, how do we get there?
3905820 3906946 On that.
3918165 3919834 - Aah!<br />- B.E.N., Shh!
3919917 3922169 Sorry, sorry. Sorry.
3929218 3931762 Okay, I'll get the map. You wait here.

4410324 4414745 The loot of a thousand worlds.
4417706 4421251 ONUS: We are going to need<br />a bigger boat!
4421418 4422961 (LAUGHING)
4433806 4436725 This is all seeming very familiar.
4438393 4441605 I can't remember why.
4442689 4443690 B.E.N., come on.
4444191 4446777 We're getting out of here, and<br />we're not leaving empty-handed.
4446860 4448362 But... But, Jimmy! Jimmy!
4450114 4452533 A lifetime of searching.
4453492 4455869 And at long last,
4457412 4460207 I can touch it.
4460541 4461750 Do you know what's strange?
4461834 4463919 I can't tell you<br />how frustrating this is, Jimmy,
4464002 4465129 'cause there's something just...
4465212 4467381 It's nagging at the back of my mind.
4467548 4468549 Aah!
4469341 4472511 - Captain Flint?<br />- In the flesh!
4473345 4476473 Well, sort of, except for skin, organs,
4476557 4479476 or anything that, that...<br />That resembles flesh,
4479560 4481186 that's not there.
4481436 4483856 And yet it's so odd, you know?
4483939 4486316 I remember<br />there was something horrible
4486400 4488610 Flint didn't want anyone else to know,
4488694 4491780 but I just can't remember what it was.
4493073 4496034 Oh, a mind is a terrible thing to lose!
4496243 4498078 (SOBBING)
4498245 4501165 B.E.N., I think I just found your mind.
4501248 4502457 - Hold still.<br />- Aah!
4502541 4505669 Jimmy, your hands are very, very cold.
4507129 4508130 Whoa!
4509214 4510382 Hello.
4510591 4513135 You know, Jimmy, I was just thinking
4513218 4515179 I was just think...
4515846 4518849 It's all flooding back! All my memories!
4518932 4520684 Right up until Flint<br />pulled my memory circuits,
4520767 4523687 so I could never tell anybody<br />about his booby trap!
4523770 4524771 (CRASHING)
4525147 4527774 - Speaking of which...<br />- Huh?
4529776 4530986 Flint wanted to make sure
4531069 4532362 that nobody could ever<br />steal his treasure,
4532446 4533739 so he rigged this whole planet
4533822 4536950 to blow higher than a Kalepsian kite!
4543540 4545125 (YELLING)
4547878 4549755 Run, Jimmy! Run for your life!
4549838 4551632 You go back and help<br />the captain and Doc!
4551715 4554468 If I'm not there in 5 minutes,<br />leave without me.
4554635 4556970 I am not leaving my buddy Jimmy.
4558305 4560807 Unless he looks at me like that.
4561183 4562226 Bye, Jim!
4569066 4572069 No! No! Oh, no! Oh, no!
4572194 4573237 No!
4575030 4576448 - Aah!<br />- Aah!

4587876 4589002 (RUMBLING)
4601598 4604476 All my life, I dreamed<br />of an adventure like this.
4605060 4606103 (SIGHS)
4606186 4607604 I'm just sorry
4607688 4610941 I couldn't have been<br />more helpful to you.
4611024 4612693 Oh, don't be daft.
4613193 4616071 You've been very helpful. Truly.
4617030 4620284 I feel like such a useless weakling
4622035 4624162 with abnormally thin wrists.
4625080 4626456 Excuse me, brutish pirate.
4626540 4627541 (BELCHES)
4627624 4629376 Yes, you. I have a question.
4629793 4631753 Is it that your body is too massive
4631837 4633297 for your teeny-tiny head,
4633714 4636049 or is it that your head is too teeny-tiny
4636133 4637634 for your big, fat body?
4638802 4641179 <i>L</i> pummel you good!
4641263 4643056 Yes, I'm sure you will,<br />but before you do,
4643140 4646018 I have one more question. Is this yours?
4646268 4647394 Uhh...
4654609 4657195 Yes! Morph, we are so out of here!
4657279 4658488 (CACKLING)
4658572 4660324 Ah, Jimbo!
4660741 4664328 Aren't you the seventh wonder<br />of the universe?
4664411 4666455 Get back!
4671668 4675130 I like you, lad, but I've come too far
4675213 4677591 to let you stand<br />between me and me treasure.
4682471 4683472 JIM: Aah!
4698195 4700447 Oh, no, you don't!
4707621 4709247 (CHATTERING)
4709456 4710582 What?
4714586 4715796 Jimbo.
4718799 4720592 Reach for me now!
4721343 4722511 Reach!
4723678 4724721 L.-
4724805 4726098 I can't!
4734981 4736024 L.-
4738777 4739778 (SIGHS)

4768682 4770183 Silver, you gave UP?
4770267 4773854 Just a lifelong obsession, Jim.<br />I'll get over it.
4774479 4775939 B.E.N.: Aloha, Jimmy!
4778442 4780235 Hurry, people!<br />We got exactly two minutes
4780318 4782446 and 34 seconds till planet's destruction!
4783447 4784489 You're doing fine, Doctor.
4784573 4786700 Now ease her over gently... Gently!
4788326 4789453 Aah!
4789536 4792289 We were better off on exploding planet!
4794958 4796626 Take us out of here, metal man!
4796793 4798044 Ave, Captain!
4801882 4804426 Captain, you dropped from<br />the heavens in the nick of...
4804718 4807137 Save your claptrap for the judge, Silver!
4807512 4809222 (CHUCKLES)
4817731 4819483 Mizzen sail demobilized, Captain!
4819566 4821151 Thrusters at only 30% of capacity.
4821401 4823361 30%? That means we're...
4823904 4826198 We'll never clear<br />the planet's explosion in time.
4834498 4836833 - We gotta turn around.<br />- What?
4837083 4839836 There's a portal back there.<br />It can get us out of here!
4840045 4842380 DOPPLER: Pardon me, Jim,<br />but didn't that portal open
4842464 4844174 onto a raging inferno?
4844758 4847552 Yes, but I'm gonna change that.
4848345 4850388 I'm gonna open a different door.
4851890 4853517 Captain, really, I don't see<br />how this is possible...
4853600 4854976 Listen to the boy!
4855101 4857604 One minute, 29 seconds<br />till planet's destruction!
4858021 4860857 - What do you need, Jim?<br />- Just some way to attach this.
4860941 4863401 All right. Stand back. Stand back, now.
4865695 4866905 There you go.
4867614 4868740 There you go.
4870283 4872285 Okay. Now, no matter what happens,
4872410 4874663 keep the ship heading<br />straight for that portal.
4875372 4876915 B.E.N.: Fifty-eight seconds!
4885173 4886716 Well, you heard him!
4886800 4890011 Get this blasted heap turned 'round!
4891388 4892639 Doctor, head us back to the portal.
4893098 4894140 Aye, Captain.
4916830 4918582 Go to the right! The right!
4918665 4921376 I know, I know!<br />Will you just let me drive?
4924462 4926172 Twenty-five seconds!
4931011 4932804 No! No!
4936349 4937726 Come on, lad.
4939352 4941271 Seventeen seconds!
4957412 4958496 B.E.N.: Seven,
4958705 4961541 six, five, four,
4961916 4964127 three, two...
4972719 4974387 Wow! Yeah!
4976056 4977849 SILVER: You done it, Jimmy!
4978475 4981603 You done it, boy! Ha, ha, ha!
4981895 4984314 Didn't I say the lad<br />had greatness in him?
4984648 4986399 (CHEERING)
4997077 5000330 Unorthodox, but ludicrously effective.
5000997 5002582 I'd be proud to recommend you
5002666 5005585 to the interstellar academy.<br />They could use a man like you.
5006419 5008797 Just wait until your mother<br />hears about this!
5009422 5011424 Of course, we may downplay<br />the life-threatening parts.
5011758 5015387 Jimmy, that was unforgettable!
5015762 5017222 I know you don't like touching,
5017305 5019683 but get ready for a hug,<br />big guy, 'cause I gotta hug ya!
5019766 5020934 (LAUGHING)
5023520 5025480 Hey, you hugged me back.
5025772 5028274 Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
5028525 5029901 (SOBBING)
5034656 5036700 Does anyone have a tissue?
5038034 5039035 (MORPH SQUEAKING)
5039119 5041955 - Morphy, we gotta make tracks.<br />- I know.
5042622 5044499 JIM: You never quit, do you?
5044999 5046960 Ah, Jimbo! Ha ha!
5047293 5049087 I was merely checking to make sure
5049170 5052424 our last longboat was safe and secure.
5053800 5054801 Mmm.
5056261 5057345 Well,
5058596 5060348 that should hold it.
5061349 5063143 I taught you too well.
5065603 5068982 If you don't mind,<br />we'd just as soon avoid prison.
5069065 5072819 Little Morphy here, he's a free spirit.
5074404 5078074 Being in a cage, it'd break his heart.
5091671 5092672 Oh!
5096217 5099095 What say you ship out with us, lad?
5099179 5101723 You and me, Hawkins and Silver,
5101806 5105894 full of ourselves and no ties to anyone!
5108730 5111858 You know, when I got on this boat,
5112984 5115820 I would've taken you up<br />on that offer in a second,
5117280 5120575 but, uh, I met this old cyborg,
5121201 5125079 and he taught me that<br />I could chart my own course.
5127332 5128875 That's what I'm gonna do.
5129375 5132879 And what do you see<br />off that bow of yours?
5135965 5137217 A future.
5137300 5138593 (CHUCKLES)
5138676 5139719 why,
5140220 5143723 look at ya, glowing like a solar fire.
5145558 5147685 You're something special, Jim.
5148102 5151606 You're gonna rattle the stars, you are.

5172794 5174295 "See ya around."
5183555 5186516 Morphy, I got a job for ya.
5187225 5191229 I need you to keep an eye<br />on this here pup.
5195358 5197151 Will ya do me that little favor?
5197235 5198862 Aye-aye, Captain.
5206244 5208121 Oh, and one more thing.
5209789 5211791 This is for your dear mother,
5211875 5214002 to rebuild that inn of hers.
5217797 5220300 Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.
5220758 5223094 (LAUGHS) Why, Jimbo, lad,
