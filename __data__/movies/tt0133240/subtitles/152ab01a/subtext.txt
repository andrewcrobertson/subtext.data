1087920 1090560 You flatter me, Captain.
1092000 1093000 Ah.
1093080 1094840 Dr. Doppler, I presume?
1094920 1096760 Uh, um... Yes. I...
1096840 1099960 -Hello! Can you hear me?<br />-Yes, I can! Stop that banging!
1100040 1102600 If I may, Doctor,<br />this works so much better
1102680 1105760 -when it's right-way up and plugged in.<br />-Ooh!
1105840 1106960 Lovely. There you go.
1107040 1109720 If you don't mind,<br />I can manage my own plugging!
1109800 1110880 I'm Captain Amelia,
1111000 1112480 late of a few run-ins<br />with the Protean Armada.
1112560 1114880 Nasty business, but I won't<br />bore you with my scars.
1115200 1117000 You've met my first officer, Mr. Arrow.
1117080 1119240 Sterling, tough, dependable,<br />honest, brave, and true.
1119320 1120480 Please, Captain.
1120560 1122480 Shut up, Arrow. You know<br />I don't mean a word of it.
1122560 1126160 Ahem. Excuse me. I hate to<br />interrupt this lovely banter,
1126240 1128520 but may I introduce to you<br />Jim Hawkins?
1128600 1131760 Jim, you see, is the boy<br />who found the treasure...
1131840 1133280 Doctor, please!
1134120 1135440 (GROWLS)
1136800 1138920 I'd like a word with you in my stateroom.
1140800 1145680 Doctor, to muse and blabber<br />about a treasure map
1146080 1148320 in front of this particular crew
1148400 1150480 demonstrates a level of ineptitude
1150560 1152520 that borders on the imbecilic,
1152600 1154440 and I mean that in a very caring way.
1154520 1157560 "Imbecilic," did you say?<br />Foolishness, I've...
1157640 1159320 May I see the map, please?
1165920 1166920 Here.
1168120 1169160 Hmm.
1169240 1170560 Fascinating.
1172080 1173920 Mr. Hawkins, in the future,
1174000 1176000 you will address me<br />as "Captain" or "ma'am."
1176080 1177080 Is that clear?
1177560 1179080 Ugh...
1179840 1180920 Mr. Hawkins?
1182160 1184320 -Yes, ma'am.<br />-That'll do.
1185280 1186880 Gentlemen, this must be kept<br />under lock and key
1186960 1190400 when not in use. And, Doctor, again,
1190480 1192320 with the greatest possible respect,
1192400 1194360 zip your howling screamer.
1194440 1195560 Captain, I assure you I...
1195640 1199240 Let me make this<br />as monosyllabic as possible.
1199320 1203880 I don't much care<br />for this crew you hired.
1203960 1205920 They're... How did<br />I describe them, Arrow?
1206000 1208560 I said something rather good<br />this morning before coffee.
1208640 1212720 "A ludicrous parcel<br />of driveling galoots," ma'am.
1212800 1216240 -There you go. Poetry.<br />-Now, see here...
1216320 1220440 Doctor, I'd love to chat,<br />tea, cake, the whole shebang,
1220520 1221720 but I have a ship to launch,
1221800 1223800 and you've got your outfit to buff up.
1224160 1226520 Mr. Arrow, please escort<br />these two neophytes
1226600 1227840 down to the galley straightaway.
1227920 1230600 Young Hawkins will be working<br />for our cook, Mr. Silver.
1230680 1232560 What? The cook?
1234360 1236920 That woman! That feline!
1237000 1238880 Who does she think<br />is working for whom?
1238960 1240960 It's my map,<br />and she's got me bussin' tables?
1241040 1244800 I'll not tolerate a cross word<br />about our captain!
1244880 1248840 There's no finer officer<br />in this or any galaxy.
1249160 1251160 (WHISTLING)
1252400 1253680 ARROW: Mr. Silver?
1253760 1255840 Why, Mr. Arrow, sir.
1256400 1258960 Bringin' in such fine<br />and distinguished gents
1259040 1260560 to grace my humble galley.
1260640 1262760 Had I known,<br />I'd have tucked in me shirt.
1263360 1264680 (CHUCKLING)
1268200 1269280 A cyborg!
1269640 1271880 May I introduce Dr. Doppler,
1272000 1274040 the financier of our voyage.
1274520 1276720 Love the outfit, Doc.
1276800 1279680 Well, thank you. Um, love the eye.
1280160 1282480 Uh, this young lad is Jim Hawkins.
1283480 1284640 Jimbo!
1290760 1295040 Now, don't be too put off<br />by this hunk of hardware.
1295880 1297360 (HUMMING)
1300960 1302040 Whoa!
1302680 1304960 These gears have been<br />tough getting used to,
1305040 1308440 but they do come in mighty handy<br />from time to time.
1317040 1318080 Mmm!
1318760 1323200 Here, now, have a taste<br />of me famous bonzabeast stew.
1323640 1325040 (SNIFFING)
1326720 1330720 Mmm! Delightfully tangy, yet robust.
1330800 1333240 SILVER: Old family recipe.
1333320 1334480 Aah!
1334600 1337760 In fact, that was part of the old family!
1337840 1339920 (LAUGHS)
1342320 1343720 I'm just kiddin', Doc!
1343800 1345640 Yeah, well...
1345720 1348080 I'm nothin' if I ain't a kidder.
1348160 1350240 Go on, Jimbo. Have a swig.
1356000 1357200 (GIGGLING)
1357520 1358960 SILVER: Morph!
1359360 1362200 You jiggle-headed blob of mischief!
1362280 1364320 So that's where you was hiding!
1365240 1366320 (CHATTERING)
1366400 1367640 (BELCH)
1371400 1372560 What is that thing?
1372680 1373720 "What is that thing?"
1373800 1375680 SILVER: He's a morph.
1375840 1378720 I rescued the little shape-shifter<br />on Proteus 1.
1379280 1380720 (COOING)
1380840 1383080 Aw, he took a shine to me.
1383160 1385480 We been together ever since.
1385600 1387960 Right? Yeah. Nice boy.
1388320 1389800 We're about to get underway.
1389880 1391960 Would you like to observe<br />the launch, Doctor?
1392040 1393120 Would I?
1393200 1396240 Does an active galactic nucleus<br />have superluminal jets?
1397480 1398960 I'll follow you.
1399040 1403560 Mr. Hawkins will stay here<br />in your charge, Mr. Silver.
1403640 1404640 (COUGHING)
1404720 1406640 Beggin' your pardon, sir, but...
1406920 1411440 Captain's orders! See to it<br />the new cabin boy's kept busy.
1411760 1414400 -But, no, but...<br />-No, you can't...
1415160 1416360 (BOTH SIGH)
1419200 1423040 So, Captain's put you with me, eh?
1423120 1424400 Whatever.
1426680 1430120 Well, who be a humble cyborg<br />to argue with a captain?
1431320 1432400 Yeah.
1433200 1435520 You know, these purps,
1435600 1439720 they're kind of like the ones<br />back home on Montressor.
1440360 1441440 You ever been there?
1441760 1444200 I can't say as I have, Jimbo.
1446240 1448640 Come to think of it, just before I left,
1448720 1450440 I met this old guy who was, um...
1451040 1454200 He was kind of looking<br />for a cyborg buddy of his.
1454280 1455320 Is that so?
1455520 1456640 Yeah.
1457360 1460040 What was that old salamander's name?
1460920 1462920 Oh, yeah. Bones.
1463640 1465120 Billy Bones?
1465200 1467920 Bones? Bones?
1469080 1470960 T'ain't ringin' any bells.
1471040 1472960 Must have been a different cyborg.
1473040 1476400 There's a slew of cyborgs<br />roamin' this port.
1476480 1479440 -(WHISTLE ON DECK)<br />-ARROW: Prepare to cast off!
1480080 1483680 Off with you, lad, and watch the launch.
1483760 1487240 There'll be plenty work<br />a-waitin' for you afterwards.
1487600 1489400 -(HUMMING)<br />-(CHATTERING)
1492560 1497080 We best be keepin' a sharp eye<br />on this one, eh, Morph?
1498400 1502320 We wouldn't want him strayin'<br />into things he shouldn't.
1503280 1505640 We're all clear, Captain!
1506080 1509040 Well, my friend. Are we ready<br />to raise this creaking tub?
1509440 1511280 My pleasure, Captain.
1511600 1514240 All hands to stations!
1515640 1516800 Smartly now!
1516880 1519600 Come on, you scurvy scum!<br />I'll race you!
1522120 1525120 Loose all solar sails!
1529240 1530240 (GRUNTING)
1530320 1531640 Come on!
1537000 1539320 ARROW: Heave up the braces.
1540400 1541800 Brace up.
1555960 1557480 Ooh! Oh!
1557560 1560360 Mr. Zoff, engage artificial gravity.
1560480 1562000 (FARTING)
1564640 1565640 (CLANKING)
1565720 1567480 (CLATTERING)
1567920 1571160 South by southwest,<br />Mr. Turnbuckle, heading 2-1-0-0.
1571480 1573960 Aye, Captain. 2-1-0-0.
1576720 1578800 Full speed, Mr. Arrow, if you please.
1578880 1579960 Take her away!
1584200 1586000 Brace yourself, Doctor.
1586080 1587200 (SNIDELY) "Brace yourself."
1588160 1589680 Aah! Oof!
1609400 1610400 Whoa.
1610520 1611920 (CALLING)
1627560 1631560 Upon my word, an Orcus Galacticus.
1633360 1634400 Smile.
1634480 1636240 Doctor, I'd stand clear...
1641360 1644000 'Tis a grand day for sailing, Captain,
1644080 1645240 and look at you.
1645720 1648160 You're as trim and as bonny as a sloop
1648240 1650760 with new sails and a fresh coat of paint.
1651120 1652720 You can keep that kind of flim-flammery
1652800 1654400 for your spaceport floozies, Silver.
1654480 1656040 "Spaceport floozy, spaceport floozy..."
1656120 1658400 You cut me to the quick, Captain.
1659000 1661560 I speaks nothing<br />but me heart at all times.
1661680 1662800 MORPH: "Nothing but me heart."
1663600 1665600 And, by the way,<br />isn't that your cabin boy
1665960 1669240 aimlessly footling about<br />in those shrouds?
1669400 1670840 Yep, it...
1671200 1676120 A momentary aberration, Cap'n,<br />soon to be addressed. Jimbo!
1677360 1680840 I got two new friends<br />I'd like you to meet.
1682160 1686600 Say hello to Mr. Mop and Mrs. Bucket.
1686840 1688600 (LAUGHING)
1688800 1690000 Yippie.
1692120 1694480 Yeah, I got your Mr. Mop.
1697840 1700120 Watch it, twerp.
1702520 1706280 (MURMURING)
1714000 1716760 What are you looking at, weirdo?
1717800 1719720 Yeah, weirdo.
1720360 1722480 (HISSING)
1723520 1729880 Cabin boys should learn<br />to mind their own business.
1730240 1732400 Why? You got something to hide,<br />bright eyes?
1734440 1738800 Maybe your ears don't work so well.
1738880 1740200 (GRUNTS) Yeah. Ahem.
1740880 1742960 Too bad my nose works just fine.
1743040 1746040 Why, you impudent little...
1747000 1748760 (CREW SHOUTING)
1749000 1752480 -Go ahead! Slice him! Dice him!<br />-(FARTING NOISE)
1752880 1756600 Any last words, cabin boy?
1759040 1760400 Mr. Scroop,
1763080 1766040 you ever see what happens<br />to a fresh purp
1766160 1769360 when you squeeze real hard?
1771880 1773360 ARROW: What's all this, then?
1777360 1778920 You know the rules.
1779000 1781360 There'll be no brawling on this ship.
1781480 1782600 Aye-aye, sir.
1782680 1786520 Any further offenders<br />will be confined to the brig
1786640 1788800 for the remainder of the voyage.
1789720 1792560 Am I clear, Mr. Scroop?
1799080 1801080 Transparently.
1806640 1809240 SILVER: Well done, Mr. Arrow, sir!
1809320 1812240 A tight ship's a happy ship, sir.
1813560 1816040 Jimbo, I gave you a job.
1816120 1818440 Hey, I was doing it until that bug thing...
1818520 1824000 Belay that! Now, I want<br />this deck swabbed spotless,
1824080 1827360 and heaven help you<br />if I come back and it's not done.
1827960 1831480 Morph? Keep an eye on this pup,
1831600 1833360 and let me know if there be<br />any more distractions.
1833440 1835000 Okay. Aye-aye.
1836080 1837840 (CHATTERING)
1837920 1839080 (SIGHS)
1841000 1842440 (CREW GRUMBLING)
1844240 1846680 So, we're all here, then.
1846760 1849360 -Excuse me.<br />-Fine.
1851240 1855760 Now, if you pardon<br />my plain speaking, gentlemen,
1856320 1857800 are you all
1857920 1862760 -stark-raving, totally blinking daft?<br />-(CHATTERS)
1863160 1865240 After all me finagling getting us hired
1865320 1866960 as an upstanding crew,
1867040 1870480 you want to blow the whole mutiny<br />before its time?
1871040 1873480 The boy was sniffing about.
1873960 1878400 You just stick to the plan,<br />you bug-brained twit.
1879240 1882920 As for the boy, I'll run him so ragged,
1883000 1885120 he won't have time to think.
1888360 1890160 (MORPH LAUGHS)
1892200 1893360 (COUGHS)
1894200 1895360 (SIGHS)
1896000 1898240 Well, this has been a fun day, huh?
1898640 1902560 Making new friends,<br />like that spider psycho.
1903040 1904800 "Spider psycho, spider psycho."
1904880 1907120 Heh. A little uglier.
1907200 1908720 (LAUGHS MANIACALLY)
1909400 1910560 Pretty close.
1910640 1911680 SILVER: Well,
1912160 1915280 thank heavens for little miracles.
1915360 1916560 Up here for an hour,
1916640 1918640 and the deck's still in one piece.
1919360 1920360 Um...
1920480 1922040 Look, I...
1923760 1925200 What you did...
1927600 1928800 Thanks.
1930920 1932520 Didn't your pop ever teach you
1932600 1934960 to pick your fights a bit more carefully?
1940440 1942680 Your father not the teachin' sort?
1943640 1944680 No.
1945040 1948720 He was more the taking off<br />and never coming back sort.
1949520 1950600 Oh.
1953760 1954960 Sorry, lad.
1955400 1958400 Hey, no big deal. I'm doing just fine.
1959720 1961080 Is that so?
1962680 1966200 Well, since the captain<br />has put you in my charge,
1966320 1968320 like it or not, I'll be pounding a few skills
1968440 1971000 into that thick head of yours<br />to keep you out of trouble.
1971080 1972120 -What?<br />-From now on,
1972240 1974360 I'm not letting you out of me sight.
1974440 1975480 You can't do...
1975560 1977520 You won't so much as eat, sleep,
1977600 1980640 or scratch your bum without my say-so.
1980720 1981800 Don't do me any favors!
1981880 1984520 You can be sure of that, my lad.
1985200 1986920 You can be sure of that.
1987000 1988880 (LAUGHS)
1993240 1995480 Put some elbow into it.
2006400 2010400 <i>I am a question to the world</i>
2010480 2013680 <i>Not an answer to be heard</i>

3361200 3362960 For heaven's sakes,<br />after a hundred years,
3363040 3365160 you go a little nuts! Ha, ha, ha!
3366720 3368520 I'm sorry. Am I...
3368600 3369880 I am, um...
3370400 3372760 My name is, uh...
3374920 3376360 (CUCKOOING)
3378000 3379880 B.E.N.! Of course, I'm B.E.N.
3379960 3382680 Bioelectronic Navigator. Oops.
3382920 3384560 -And you are?<br />-Jim.
3384640 3386440 Oh, what a pleasure<br />to meet you, Jimmy.
3386520 3388240 -It's Jim.<br />-Anyway...
3388360 3389640 Look, I'm kind of in a hurry, okay?
3390000 3392640 I got to find a place to hide,<br />and there's pirates chasing me.
3392720 3395320 Pirates! Don't get me started on pirates!
3395400 3398600 I don't like them.<br />I remember Captain Flint.
3399040 3400960 This guy had such a temper.
3401240 3403200 Wait, wait, wait.<br />You knew Captain Flint?
3403280 3406160 I think he suffered<br />from mood swings, personally.
3406240 3408000 I'm not a therapist, and anyway,
3408080 3409960 but I... You let me know<br />when I'm rambling.
3410200 3411480 But that means... But wait.
3411560 3413800 But then you gotta know<br />about the treasure?
3414120 3415400 -Treasure?<br />-Yeah, Flint's trove?
3415480 3417840 You know, loot of a thousand worlds.
3417920 3419760 It's, well...
3419840 3423000 It's all a little... Little... Little fuzzy.
3423560 3426400 Wait. I... I remember.
3427280 3428720 I do. I... Treasure!
3428800 3431720 Lots of treasure buried in the centroid...
3431880 3433760 Centroid... Centroid of the mechanism.
3434000 3437240 And there was this big door<br />opening and closing,
3437320 3439360 and opening and closing,
3439440 3440680 and Captain Flint wanted to make sure
3440760 3442120 nobody could ever get to his treasure,
3442200 3444800 so I helped him. (SPLUTTERING)
3446040 3448800 Aah! Data inaccessible! Reboot!
3448880 3450520 JIM: B.E.N.? B.E.N.? B.E.N.!
3450600 3452960 Reboot! Aah! And you are?
3453080 3454360 Wait, wait, wait!<br />What about the treasure?
3454640 3455920 I want to say Larry.
3456000 3458360 The centroid of the mechanism, or...
3458440 3461080 I'm sorry. My memory<br />isn't what it used to be.
3461280 3463240 I've lost my mind.
3463320 3466000 I've lost my mind.<br />You haven't found it, have you?
3466080 3469600 My missing piece?<br />My primary memory circuit?
3470000 3474080 Look, B.E.N., I really need<br />to find a place to hide, okay?
3474160 3477760 So I'm just gonna be,<br />you know, moving on.
3478480 3479760 Oh, uh...
3480000 3481840 So, well, then,
3481920 3485120 I guess this is good-bye, huh?
3486040 3489960 I'm sorry that I'm so dysfunctional.
3491240 3495440 So, uh, go ahead and... I do understand.
3495880 3498480 I do. Bye-bye.
3500600 3501680 (WHINES)
3502160 3503200 (SIGHS)
3503280 3504960 Look, if you're gonna come along,
3505040 3506400 you're gonna have to stop talking.
3506560 3508760 Huzzah! Ha, ha, ha!
3508840 3510440 Oh, this is fantastic!
3510520 3513440 Me and my best buddy<br />out lookin' for a...
3514280 3515440 (CLEARS THROAT)
3516040 3517480 (WHISPERING) Being quiet.
3517560 3520000 And you have to stop touching me.
3520080 3523680 Touching and talking.<br />That's my two big no-nos.
3523800 3525920 Okay. Now, I think that we should...
3526000 3529560 Say, listen, before we go out<br />on our big search,
3529640 3533680 would you mind if we made a quick<br />pit stop at my place? (CHUCKLES)
3534000 3535480 Kind of urgent.
3535680 3539280 JIM: B.E.N., I think<br />you just solved my problem.
3543720 3544840 B.E.N.: Pardon the mess, people.
3545280 3546400 You'd think in 100 years
3546480 3547920 I would've dusted a little more often,
3548000 3550240 but, you know, when you're batchin' it,
3550320 3552960 you tend to let things go.
3553360 3555080 Aw. Isn't that sweet?
3555480 3558400 I find old-fashioned romance<br />so touching, don't you?
3558720 3560720 How about drinks for the happy couple?
3561480 3563200 Oh, uh, ooh. Uh, no.
3563280 3564600 Thank you, we don't drink,
3564680 3566680 and we're not a couple.
3568880 3569960 Ahem.
3570040 3572080 Look at these markings.
3572160 3574960 They're identical<br />to the ones on the map.
3575040 3577040 I suspect these are<br />the hieroglyphic remnants
3577120 3578920 of an ancient culture.
3579000 3580120 CAPTAIN AMELIA: Mr. Hawkins,
3580400 3583080 stop anyone who tries to approach. Ohh!
3583160 3585160 Yes, yes. Now listen to me,
3585240 3588840 stop giving orders for<br />a few milliseconds and lie still.
3589440 3591120 Very forceful, Doctor.
3591520 3592960 Go on. Say something else.
3594520 3596520 Hey, look! There's<br />some more of your buddies!
3596720 3599520 Hey, fellas! We're over here, fellas!
3599640 3601840 Oh! Uhh! Ooh! Ohh!
3605440 3608480 SILVER: Stop wastin' your fire!
3609920 3612440 Hello, up there!
3615440 3616600 Jimbo?
3617200 3620400 If it's all right with the captain,
3620480 3623040 I'd like a short word with ya.
3623520 3626600 No tricks, just a little palaver.
3626960 3629800 Come to bargain for the map,<br />doubtless.
3629920 3631000 Pestilential...
3631080 3632400 -Ugh!<br />-Captain.
3633040 3637600 That means that he thinks<br />we still have it.
3643920 3648320 Morphy! I wondered where you lit off to.
3649560 3651480 (GROANING)
3652960 3653960 Ooh.
3654400 3657440 Oh, this poor old leg's downright snarky,
3657520 3660200 since that game attack<br />we had in the galley. (CHUCKLES)
3663040 3664040 Ahh.
3666400 3669160 Whatever you heard back there,
3669240 3671200 at least the part concerning you,
3672400 3675000 I didn't mean a word of it.
3675600 3679600 If that bloodthirsty lot<br />had thought I'd gone soft,
3679680 3681640 they'd have gutted us both.
3684960 3688640 Listen to me. If we play our cards right,
3688720 3693960 we can both walk away<br />from this rich as kings.
3694120 3696080 -Yeah?<br />-(CHUCKLES)
3696160 3700800 You get me that map,
3701440 3705920 and an even portion<br />of the treasure is yours.
3711440 3712520 Boy.
3714160 3716160 You are really something.
3717160 3719640 All that talk of greatness,
3719720 3723040 light coming off my sails, what a joke.
3723120 3724640 Now, just see here, Jimbo...
3724720 3725920 I mean, at least<br />you taught me one thing.
3726000 3727320 Stick to it, right?
3727960 3729280 Well, that's just what I'm gonna do.
3729680 3731160 I'm gonna make sure that you never see
3731240 3733560 one drabloon of my treasure!
3733840 3737240 That treasure is owed me, by thunder!
3737320 3741640 Well, try to find it<br />without my map, by thunder!
3742640 3746800 Oh, you still don't know how to<br />pick your fights, do you, boy?
3747600 3749320 Now, mark me.
3750560 3753880 Either I get that map by dawn tomorrow,
3754280 3758080 or so help me,<br />I'll use the ship's cannons
3758440 3761760 to blast ya all to kingdom come!
3763120 3765040 Morph, hop to it.
3767000 3768080 Now!
3770480 3772240 Oh, blast it!
3783920 3785520 Gentlemen,
3786520 3789720 we must stay together and...
3789920 3791160 And...
3791240 3793280 -Ohh.<br />-And what? What?
3793360 3795720 We must stay together and what?
3796120 3801200 Doctor, you have wonderful eyes.
3801560 3802960 She's lost her mind!
3803080 3804240 Well, you gotta help her.
3804440 3806920 Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer,<br />not a doctor.
3807000 3808800 I mean, I am a doctor,<br />but I'm not that kind of doctor.
3808880 3810880 I have a doctorate.<br />It's not the same thing.
3810960 3812240 You can't help people with a doctorate.
3812320 3814840 You just sit there, and you're useless.
3815080 3816520 It's okay, Doc.
3817400 3818960 It's all right.
3819280 3822640 Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows<br />exactly how to get out of this.
3822720 3825280 It's just Jimmy<br />has this knowledge of things.
3826200 3828440 Jim, any thoughts at all?
3830120 3832240 Without the map, we're dead.
3833400 3835720 If we try to leave, we're dead.
3836680 3838200 -If we stay here...<br />-"We're dead!
3838280 3840160 "We're dead! We're dead!"
3844680 3848440 Well, I think that Jimmy<br />could use a little quiet time. Heh.
3849080 3851600 So I'll just slip out the back door.
3852200 3853720 -Back door?<br />-Oh, yeah.
3853800 3856680 I get this delightful breeze through here,
3856760 3857920 which I think is important,
3858000 3859480 because ventilation among friends...
3859560 3862080 JIM: Whoa. What is all this stuff?
3862160 3864000 B.E.N.: You mean the miles and miles<br />of machinery that run
3864080 3866240 through the entire course<br />of the inside of this planet?
3866880 3867960 Not a clue.
3868280 3870360 Hey, Doc! Doc! I think<br />I found a way out of here!
3870520 3872920 No, no. Jim, wait.<br />The captain ordered us to stay...
3873000 3875800 -I'll be back.<br />-Cannonball!
3876320 3877400 Woof.
3878280 3880240 (SNORING)
3885880 3888800 -So, what's the plan?<br />-Shh. B.E.N., quiet.
3892680 3893960 (WHISPERING) Okay, here it is.
3894080 3897040 We sneak back to the <i>Legacy,</i><br />disable the laser cannons,
3897120 3899040 and bring back the map.
3899120 3900280 (MUFFLED) That's a good plan.
3900360 3901680 I like that plan. The only thing is,
3901760 3904280 I'm wondering, how do we get there?
3904800 3905880 On that.
3917080 3918760 -Aah!<br />-B.E.N., shh!
3918840 3921080 Sorry, sorry. Sorry.
3928160 3930680 Okay, I'll get the map. You wait here.

3944400 3946680 All we gotta do is find that one little wire.

4238800 4241000 At least, I think it's my life.

4260720 4261720 Huh?
4262720 4263960 Where is it?
4264040 4268200 I see nothing! One great, big<br />stinking hunk of nothing!
4269200 4271400 What's going on, Jimbo?
4271480 4274040 I don't know. I can't get it open.
4274400 4277040 We should've never followed this boy!
4277120 4278320 Hey!

4331880 4333120 Kinapis.

4339800 4341640 So that's how Flint did it.
4341760 4347000 He used this portal to roam<br />the universe, stealing treasure.
4347080 4349280 But where'd he stash it all?

4356680 4358080 It's buried in the...

4362600 4366840 What if the whole planet<br />is the mechanism,

4370840 4372880 (SHOUTING)
4374240 4377160 And how in blue blazes<br />are we supposed to get there?
4378080 4380320 Just open the right door.
4393520 4395040 (ALARM BEEPING)
4398120 4400120 Wait for me! Wait for me!
4403200 4404440 (GASPS)
4407000 4408280 (CHEERING)
4409280 4413720 The loot of a thousand worlds.
4416680 4420160 ONUS: We are going to need<br />a bigger boat!
4420320 4421880 (LAUGHING)
4432720 4435680 This is all seeming very familiar.
4437360 4440560 I can't remember why.
4441600 4442640 B.E.N., come on.
4443160 4445680 We're getting out of here, and<br />we're not leaving empty-handed.
4445760 4447280 But... But, Jimmy! Jimmy!
4449040 4451480 A lifetime of searching.
4452400 4454800 And at long last,
4456360 4459160 I can touch it.
4459520 4460680 Do you know what's strange?
4460760 4462840 I can't tell you<br />how frustrating this is, Jimmy,
4462920 4464080 'cause there's something just...
4464160 4466320 It's nagging at the back of my mind.
4466520 4467520 Aah!
4468240 4471440 -Captain Flint?<br />-In the flesh!
4472280 4475440 Well, sort of, except for skin, organs,
4475520 4478400 or anything that, that...<br />That resembles flesh,
4478480 4480120 that's not there.
4480400 4482800 And yet it's so odd, you know?
4482880 4485280 I remember<br />there was something horrible
4485360 4487520 Flint didn't want anyone else to know,
4487600 4490720 but I just can't remember what it was.
4492000 4494960 Oh, a mind is a terrible thing to lose!
4495160 4497000 (SOBBING)
4497200 4500080 B.E.N., I think I just found your mind.
4500160 4501360 -Hold still.<br />-Aah!
4501440 4504640 Jimmy, your hands are very, very cold.
4506080 4507080 Whoa!
4508120 4509280 Hello.
4509520 4512040 You know, Jimmy, I was just thinking...
4512120 4514080 I was just think...
4514800 4517800 It's all flooding back! All my memories!
4517880 4519640 Right up until Flint<br />pulled my memory circuits,
4519720 4522640 so I could never tell anybody<br />about his booby trap!
4522720 4523720 (CRASHING)
4524120 4526680 -Speaking of which...<br />-Huh?
4528720 4529920 Flint wanted to make sure
4530000 4531320 that nobody could ever<br />steal his treasure,
4531400 4532680 so he rigged this whole planet
4532800 4535920 to blow higher than a Kalepsian kite!
4542440 4544080 (YELLING)
4546840 4548720 Run, Jimmy! Run for your life!
4548800 4550600 You go back and help<br />the captain and Doc!
4550680 4553400 If I'm not there in 5 minutes,<br />leave without me.
4553560 4555920 I am not leaving my buddy Jimmy.
4557280 4559720 Unless he looks at me like that.
4560160 4561160 Bye, Jim!
4568040 4571040 No! No! Oh, no! Oh, no!
4571160 4572160 No!
4574000 4575360 -Aah!<br />-Aah!
4579520 4581320 (CREW YELLING)
4582040 4584960 Come back here, ya blighters!
4586840 4587960 (RUMBLING)
4600520 4603400 All my life, I dreamed<br />of an adventure like this.
4604000 4605040 (SIGHS)
4605120 4606520 I'm just sorry
4606600 4609920 I couldn't have been<br />more helpful to you.
4610000 4611640 Oh, don't be daft.
4612120 4615040 You've been very helpful. Truly.
4616000 4619200 I feel like such a useless weakling
4620960 4623080 with abnormally thin wrists.
4624040 4625360 Excuse me, brutish pirate.
4625440 4626480 (BELCHES)
4626560 4628320 Yes, you. I have a question.
4628760 4630680 Is it that your body is too massive
4630760 4632200 for your teeny-tiny head,
4632640 4635000 or is it that your head is too teeny-tiny
4635080 4636560 for your big, fat body?
4637760 4640160 I pummel you good!
4640240 4642000 Yes, I'm sure you will,<br />but before you do,
4642080 4644920 I have one more question. Is this yours?
4645240 4646360 Uhh...
4653560 4656160 Yes! Morph, we are so out of here!
4656240 4657440 (CACKLING)
4657520 4659240 Ah, Jimbo!
4659680 4663240 Aren't you the seventh wonder<br />of the universe?
4663320 4665400 Get back!
4670600 4674040 I like you, lad, but I've come too far
4674120 4676560 to let you stand<br />between me and me treasure.
4681440 4682440 JIM: Aah!
4697160 4699360 Oh, no, you don't!
4706560 4708160 (CHATTERING)
4708400 4709520 What?
4713520 4714760 Jimbo.
4717720 4719520 Reach for me now!
4720320 4721480 Reach!
4722640 4723640 I...
4723720 4725000 I can't!
4733920 4735000 I...
4737680 4738680 (SIGHS)
4739880 4743920 Oh, blast me for a fool!

4767600 4769160 Silver, you gave up?
4769240 4772760 Just a lifelong obsession, Jim.<br />I'll get over it.
4773400 4774880 B.E.N.: <i>Aloha,</i> Jimmy!
4777360 4779160 Hurry, people!<br />We got exactly two minutes
4779240 4781360 and 34 seconds till planet's destruction!
4782360 4783440 You're doing fine, Doctor.
4783520 4785680 Now ease her over gently... Gently!
4787240 4788400 Aah!
4788480 4791240 We were better off on exploding planet!
4793920 4795560 Take us out of here, metal man!
4795720 4797000 Aye, Captain!
4800840 4803400 Captain, you dropped from<br />the heavens in the nick of...
4803640 4806080 Save your claptrap for the judge, Silver!
4806440 4808160 (CHUCKLES)
4816680 4818440 Mizzen sail demobilized, Captain!
4818520 4820120 Thrusters at only 30% of capacity.
4820320 4822280 30%? That means we're...
4822800 4825120 We'll never clear<br />the planet's explosion in time.
4833400 4835760 -We gotta turn around.<br />-What?
4836000 4838760 There's a portal back there.<br />It can get us out of here!
4838960 4841360 DOPPLER: Pardon me, Jim,<br />but didn't that portal open
4841440 4843120 onto a raging inferno?
4843680 4846480 Yes, but I'm gonna change that.
4847320 4849320 I'm gonna open a different door.
4850800 4852440 Captain, really, I don't see<br />how this is possible...
4852520 4853920 Listen to the boy!
4854000 4856520 One minute, 29 seconds<br />till planet's destruction!
4856960 4859760 -What do you need, Jim?<br />-Just some way to attach this.
4859840 4862320 All right. Stand back. Stand back, now.
4864600 4865840 There you go.
4866560 4867640 There you go.
4869240 4871200 Okay. Now, no matter what happens,
4871320 4873640 keep the ship heading<br />straight for that portal.
4874320 4875840 B.E.N.: Fifty-eight seconds!
4884120 4885640 Well, you heard him!
4885720 4888960 Get this blasted heap turned 'round!
4890360 4891560 Doctor, head us back to the portal.
4892000 4893040 Aye, Captain.
4915800 4917520 Go to the right! The right!
4917600 4920320 I know, I know!<br />Will you just let me drive?
4923360 4925080 Twenty-five seconds!
4929960 4931720 No! No!
4935280 4936680 Come on, lad.
4938320 4940240 Seventeen seconds!
4956360 4957400 B.E.N.: Seven,
4957680 4960480 six, five, four,
4960880 4963080 three, two...
4971640 4973360 Wow! Yeah!
4975000 4976760 SILVER: You done it, Jimmy!
4977440 4980560 You done it, boy! Ha, ha, ha!
4980840 4983280 Didn't I say the lad<br />had greatness in him?
4983560 4985360 (CHEERING)
4996000 4999280 Unorthodox, but ludicrously effective.
4999920 5001520 I'd be proud to recommend you
5001600 5004560 to the interstellar academy.<br />They could use a man like you.
5005360 5007760 Just wait until your mother<br />hears about this!
5008320 5010400 Of course, we may downplay<br />the life-threatening parts.
5010680 5014320 Jimmy, that was unforgettable!
5014680 5016160 I know you don't like touching,
5016280 5018640 but get ready for a hug,<br />big guy, 'cause I gotta hug ya!
5018720 5019840 (LAUGHING)
5022480 5024440 Hey, you hugged me back.
5024680 5027240 Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
5027480 5028800 (SOBBING)
5033600 5035600 Does anyone have a tissue?

5038080 5040880 -Morphy, we gotta make tracks.<br />-I know.
5041520 5043440 JIM: You never quit, do you?
5043960 5045880 Ah, Jimbo! Ha ha!
5046240 5048040 I was merely checking to make sure
5048120 5051360 our last longboat was safe and secure.
5052720 5053720 Mmm.
5055200 5056320 Well,
5057520 5059320 that should hold it.
5060320 5062120 I taught you too well.
5064520 5067920 If you don't mind,<br />we'd just as soon avoid prison.
5068000 5071760 Little Morphy here, he's a free spirit.
5073360 5077000 Being in a cage, it'd break his heart.
5090640 5091640 Oh!
5095160 5098040 What say you ship out with us, lad?
5098160 5100640 You and me, Hawkins and Silver,
5100720 5104840 full of ourselves and no ties to anyone!
5107680 5110800 You know, when I got on this boat,
5111920 5114720 I would've taken you up<br />on that offer in a second,
5116240 5119520 but, uh, I met this old cyborg,
5120120 5124040 and he taught me that<br />I could chart my own course.
5126240 5127840 That's what I'm gonna do.
5128320 5131800 And what do you see<br />off that bow of yours?
5134880 5136160 A future.
5136240 5137520 (CHUCKLES)
5137600 5138680 Why,
5139200 5142680 look at ya, glowing like a solar fire.
5144520 5146600 You're something special, Jim.
5147080 5150560 You're gonna rattle the stars, you are.
5158160 5159520 (CLEARS THROAT)

5171760 5173240 "See ya around."
5182480 5185480 Morphy, I got a job for ya.
5186160 5190160 I need you to keep an eye<br />on this here pup.
5194320 5196080 Will ya do me that little favor?
5196160 5197760 Aye-aye, Captain.
5205160 5207080 Oh, and one more thing.
5208760 5210720 This is for your dear mother,
5210800 5212960 to rebuild that inn of hers.
5216720 5219200 Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.
5219680 5222000 (LAUGHS) Why, Jimbo, lad,
5222440 5224960 when have I ever done otherwise?
