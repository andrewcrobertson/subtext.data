1376 3743 CONLI: <i>Welcome to<br />our audio commentary</i>
3837 6169 <i>on our film</i> Treasure Planet.
6256 8497 <i>My name's Roy Conti.<br />I'm the producer of the film.</i>
9301 10416 <i>And I'm Ron Clements.</i>
10511 13845 <i>I'm the co-director and co-writer<br />of the film.</i>
13931 17674 <i>And this is John Musker,<br />the other co-director/co-writer.</i>
17768 21056 <i>Hi. I'm Glen Keane.<br />I'm a supervising animator at Disney,</i>
21146 26391 <i>and my job on this film was to design<br />and animate the character John Silver.</i>
26944 31279 <i>Hi. I'm John Ripa, and I was<br />supervising animator on Jim Hawkins.</i>
31365 35359 <i>Hi. I'm Ian Gooding. I'm the associate<br />art director on</i> Treasure Planet,
35452 40197 <i>and hopefully I can give you<br />some insight into how color is done</i>
40290 44375 <i>on a Disney animated feature<br />during the course of this commentary.</i>
45587 46998 MUSKER: <i>The entire prologue here,</i>
47089 50207 <i>we actually changed around<br />during the course of production,</i>
50300 51756 <i>in that it used to take place...</i>
51843 56053 <i>The story used to be told first-person.<br />Jim was the adult narrator of this story,</i>
56139 58743 <i>and he sort of pulled us into it,<br />but we discovered through the course</i>
58767 61634 <i>of some previews and whatnot<br />that it was playing kind of dark,</i>
61728 63706 <i>and we didn't have Jim<br />as a character involved in it,</i>
63730 66939 <i>so fairly late into production,<br />we reworked this opening</i>
67025 69733 <i>such that we see young Jim as a child.</i>
69820 72312 <i>We don't hear Jim<br />as an adult narrator anymore,</i>
72406 74022 <i>we hear Tony Jay who is...</i>
74116 77950 <i>Those of you voice recognition experts<br />from the FBI know</i>
78036 82075 <i>he was the voice of Frollo<br />in</i> Hunchback,
82165 83997 <i>in which Roy worked closely with Tony</i>
84084 86020 <i>and knew him from theatrical days<br />as I understand it.</i>
86044 87876 CLEMENTS: <i>Great voice.</i><br />MUSKER: <i>Exactly.</i>
91174 94758 CLEMENTS: <i>Now we see young Jim,<br />little five-year-old Jim Hawkins.</i>
95596 98338 <i>Voices of Laurie Metcalf<br />and Austin Majors,</i>
98432 103177 <i>who is the little kid on</i> NYPD Blue,<br /><i>he plays Dennis Franz's son.</i>
103270 104330 CONLI: <i>You should talk<br />about the recording.</i>
104354 105415 MUSKER: <i>Yes, he was recording</i>
105439 107125 <i>in the same room<br />that we're in right now, actually,</i>
107149 109857 <i>and he was funny 'cause we had<br />Glen Keane in here working with him</i>
109943 112480 <i>'cause Glen really works well<br />with children</i>
112571 114107 <i>and was gonna animate some of this,</i>
114197 115800 <i>and we wanted to get him involved<br />in the recording,</i>
115824 118156 <i>and so Austin was all over the place,</i>
118243 120985 <i>so they had to put tape on the floor,<br />"Austin, stay by the tape,"</i>
121079 124617 <i>and it was an interesting<br />recording session.</i>
125000 126240 KEANE: <i>This was fun for me</i>
126335 130078 <i>because after doing Long John Silver<br />for the whole film,</i>
130172 134006 <i>to get a chance to do something cute,</i>
134092 136584 <i>it wasn't supposed to<br />look mean and ugly.</i>
136678 138134 <i>It was a nice change.</i>
138221 140838 RIPA: <i>Yeah, well,<br />we certainly appreciated</i>
140932 142889 <i>and needed your help at the time.</i>
142976 144432 MUSKER: <i>Jim's mother, Sarah,</i>
144519 146279 <i>it was an interesting<br />acting challenge for us</i>
146313 148975 <i>because we wanted to find someone<br />whose voice was old enough</i>
149066 150627 <i>that you bought as his mother,<br />and yet young enough</i>
150651 153188 <i>because she had Jim at an early age.</i>
153570 157814 <i>And Laurie Metcalf was special to us in<br />that she could play the maternal thing,</i>
157908 162027 <i>but she could get this sort of weariness<br />of being the single mother</i>
162120 164157 <i>who really had to make ends meet<br />on her own,</i>
164247 168741 <i>and yet a kind of vulnerability<br />underneath the kind of toughness</i>
168835 171327 <i>that she had to acquire to be<br />her own woman.</i>
171421 174834 <i>Sarah's clean-up,<br />that is the refined drawings done</i>
174925 178168 <i>over the rough animator's drawings<br />was done by Vera Pacheco,</i>
178261 181629 <i>a wonderful draftsperson<br />and the woman who, in fact,</i>
181723 185341 <i>supervised all of the clean-up<br />animation on the entire movie.</i>
185435 187017 <i>And Vera did a wonderful job</i>
187104 191598 <i>of really giving us<br />such a rich-looking, well-drawn film.</i>
192317 194684 <i>It had to be crafted particularly well.</i>
194778 197736 <i>It's being blown up<br />to large format systems,</i>
197823 201236 <i>and every little nuance<br />shows up on those big screens,</i>
201326 204318 <i>and we've been delighted to see<br />how solid the drawing is,</i>
204413 208623 <i>and our hats are off to Vera<br />for the great job she did on this movie.</i>
212921 214732 CONLI: <i>This was actually...<br />As we said we changed the story.</i>
214756 218215 <i>John had this idea of doing this<br />whole thing with the storybook,</i>
218301 221635 <i>making this pop-up book,<br />which wasn't part of the original thing,</i>
221722 224384 <i>and then we take this into<br />the transition to Jim Hawkins.</i>
224474 226215 <i>He's now 15-years-old.</i>
226309 228971 <i>We added that title<br />just in case you didn't know</i>
229062 231394 <i>that it was several years later.</i>
231898 233980 RIPA: <i>This section was a lot of fun.</i>
234067 237105 <i>Jin Kim, who was one<br />of the animators on the character,</i>
237195 239311 <i>did such an outstanding job.</i>
239740 241401 <i>These scenes were very difficult.</i>
241491 244404 <i>They dealt<br />with a three-dimensional board,</i>
244494 247612 <i>which, a lot of times,<br />he had to indicate beforehand,</i>
247706 249572 <i>3-D moving backgrounds.</i>
250375 253538 <i>He just really took to it<br />and did such a fun job.</i>
253962 257375 <i>The sequence, overall,<br />was just a lot of fun to design</i>
257466 260549 <i>and come up with movements<br />and poses, it really uses a lot of things.</i>
260635 265926 <i>It kind of went X Game crazy, I guess,<br />where there's sky surfing,</i>
266016 269805 <i>there's windsurfing, there's<br />skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing.</i>
269895 272762 <i>It kind of incorporates<br />a little bit of everything.</i>
272856 276645 <i>Also, Anthony Wong, Mike Cedeno,<br />John Pomeroy</i>
276735 278191 <i>did these few scenes here.</i>
278528 281190 <i>Um, Danny Galieote,<br />some of the other animators</i>
281281 282442 <i>that worked on the character</i>
282532 284692 <i>and just did a nice job,<br />everybody matching each other,</i>
284743 286529 <i>and clean-up did a nice job</i>
286620 288473 <i>because everybody does draw<br />a little bit different.</i>
288497 291142 <i>No matter what you do, everybody<br />has their set way of drawing.</i>
291166 291701 <i>No matter what you do, everybody<br />has their set way of drawing.</i>
291792 295831 <i>And did a nice job pulling the character<br />into a consistent range.</i>
295921 299630 GOODING: <i>Establishing shot of the<br />Benbow Inn, painted by Carl Jones.</i>
300342 304085 <i>Really interesting 70/30 rule<br />that we had,</i>
304179 310141 <i>which was 70% 18th century mostly,<br />and 30% science fiction,</i>
310227 314471 <i>so we have half-timbered houses<br />with all sorts of techie stuff on them.</i>
316650 320735 CONLI: <i>And here we introduce<br />Doctor Doppler, David Hyde Pierce.</i>
320821 324155 <i>This part was written<br />with David Hyde Pierce in mind.</i>
324241 326522 MUSKER: <i>ironically, then we tested<br />a bunch of other actors</i>
326576 328095 <i>before coming back<br />to David Hyde Pierce.</i>
328119 329860 <i>Why we did that, I don't know exactly.</i>
329955 332413 CONLI: <i>Because it's your prerogative.</i><br />MUSKER: <i>I know.</i>
332499 336333 CONLI: <i>Well, we wanted to make sure,<br />but he was definitely right for the part.</i>
336419 339099 <i>Although, we struggled a little bit<br />trying to get the right feeling,</i>
339172 341004 <i>and this bit here with the little girl,</i>
341091 344300 <i>this was added, actually,<br />fairly late in the game.</i>
344386 346753 <i>We felt we needed<br />a better introduction to Doppler.</i>
346847 348087 (SCREAMS)
348557 350201 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, we had a meeting<br />with some other writers</i>
350225 353684 <i>and story people to kick around<br />ideas for punching up his introduction.</i>
354437 356249 <i>Baird and Gerson,<br />if I've got their names straight,</i>
356273 358459 <i>they did some writing in this area,<br />some of which is here.</i>
358483 360975 <i>And David certainly was<br />a great improv guy,</i>
361069 363231 <i>so some of his funniest dialogue<br />throughout the film,</i>
363321 365813 <i>and even in this section,<br />were things that he winged in,</i>
365907 368774 <i>and he was just great,<br />great to work with, funny.</i>
369119 370450 Ooh... Wrong turn.
370537 373279 -Okay. Thanks for the lift, guys.<br />-Not so fast.
373373 379710 RIPA: <i>Joey Gordon-Levitt did the voice<br />of Jim, and that was just really a treat.</i>
379796 381707 <i>He did such a good job.</i>
382340 384527 <i>One of the things, as supervising<br />animator that you get to do,</i>
384551 386904 <i>which is really cool, is you get to go<br />to the recording sessions,</i>
386928 391923 <i>and watching Joey record the lines<br />was really inspiring.</i>
392017 394634 <i>He has a good, strong range,</i>
394728 397595 <i>and I always felt like<br />he put a lot of emotion into it.</i>
397689 401683 <i>There were some scenes that he did<br />that were so explosive,</i>
401776 405314 <i>and you're just chomping at the bit.<br />You really can't wait to get to them.</i>
405405 411026 <i>And another thing that he did<br />that I really was inspired by</i>
411828 413389 <i>was you felt he believed<br />in the character,</i>
413413 417748 <i>and he had a certain take<br />on the character,</i>
417834 423170 <i>and if lines came up that he wasn't<br />comfortable or sure about,</i>
423256 426715 <i>where it didn't feel like the character,<br />he'd try and improve them,</i>
426801 429668 <i>and come up with lines<br />that he could believe</i>
429763 431253 <i>were coming from this character.</i>
431348 435012 <i>And that's kind of what we do as a<br />supervisor when we approach a scene,</i>
435101 437388 <i>is to try and find something<br />that's true to the character,</i>
437479 440187 <i>and something that you believe in<br />and feels right.</i>
440273 443891 <i>And to watch him doing<br />the same things at the voice level,</i>
443985 449071 <i>really helped to set up and inspire me<br />and our team, I think,</i>
449157 451865 <i>for the scenes that we<br />were going to do.</i>
452869 454200 Jim?
454621 456203 Jim, look at me.
457791 460579 CONLI: <i>We added this bit<br />with Jim helping clear the tables</i>
460669 462785 <i>just to make him<br />a little more sympathetic.</i>
462879 466042 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, this was John Ripa's<br />idea to make Jim a little more active.</i>
466174 467944 <i>He's actually helping his mother out<br />in the end, here,</i>
467968 469362 <i>rather than just standing there<br />kind of moping.</i>
469386 473300 <i>We wanted to make him more active<br />to build a little sympathy for him.</i>
473390 475826 <i>In the earlier versions of the story,<br />he used to just sort of walk out</i>
475850 478371 <i>in the middle of their conversation.<br />She'd turn around and he was gone.</i>
478395 480853 <i>That seemed maybe a little too rude,</i>
480939 484307 <i>so we reworked it where he stayed<br />there in the scene.</i>
489114 493358 CONLI: <i>Lot of discussion about this<br />and the off-screen conversation</i>
493451 495158 <i>and what Sarah would say.</i>
495245 499079 MUSKER: <i>I thought it was more<br />emotional to have Jim be listening,</i>
499165 500280 <i>and hear himself discussed.</i>
500375 503215 <i>It just seemed like that if you're a kid<br />and you're hearing your parents</i>
503253 505915 <i>talk about you or adults talk about you,<br />they're not aware of it,</i>
506006 508794 <i>and you're overhearing this,<br />and they can speak frankly</i>
508883 510794 <i>about what they feel about you,<br />but you're on...</i>
510885 513001 <i>We sort of see his face<br />as he's hearing this,</i>
513096 515116 <i>we just thought this was a way<br />of getting inside his head</i>
515140 517177 <i>and feeling a little more<br />sympathy for him.</i>
517267 520055 <i>This dialogue used to be played<br />in a scene where he wasn't there,</i>
520145 523683 <i>and we just felt it was good<br />to play the dialogue off his face.</i>
523773 526481 CONLI: <i>There was also a question,<br />like the father thing,</i>
526568 531108 <i>this was the first real reference<br />to the father and that he's not there.</i>
531197 534189 <i>It was a big question about how much<br />to say at this point,</i>
534284 537276 <i>how much to reveal, and how much<br />to reveal in the course of the story</i>
537370 542956 <i>because Jim's loss of his father<br />is a big part of his problem,</i>
544544 547457 <i>but we didn't want to say it all too early.</i>
548048 549692 MUSKER: <i>We've got<br />Billy Bones' entrance here,</i>
549716 551127 <i>who is voiced by Patrick McGoohan,</i>
551217 553754 <i>who those of you fellow boomers know</i>
553845 556712 <i>from</i> The Prisoner<br /><i>and</i> Secret Agent Man.
556806 558547 Braveheart, <i>more recently.</i>
558641 559827 <i>And</i> The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh.
559851 562058 <i>So, it was a big geek fest for all of us<br />baby boomers</i>
562145 566184 <i>to be recording Patrick McGoohan,<br />who came in and was actually having</i>
566274 570689 <i>a very bad cold, was very phlegmy<br />and coughy, and it worked well</i>
570779 572941 <i>with things like this,<br />with his coughs of...</i>
573031 574216 CONLI: <i>He loved doing that coughing.</i>
574240 575384 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, 50 different coughs.</i>
575408 577991 CONLI: <i>I think he did... We could have<br />10 minutes of that cough.</i>
578078 582697 KEANE: <i>Nancy Beiman, who did<br />this Billy Bones character,</i>
582791 584998 <i>she researches everything.</i>
585085 591502 <i>This character was truly a believable,<br />organic character.</i>
591591 594925 <i>She developed his whole planet<br />where he had come from.</i>
595011 596363 <i>He's kind of from a turtle planet.</i>
596387 600096 <i>The way the neck comes out,<br />she had worked on all the anatomy.</i>
600183 604302 <i>Everything that she put into him,<br />there's nothing by chance on this guy.</i>
604395 607433 <i>And she's a pretty good example<br />of all the animators,</i>
607524 612394 <i>how everybody takes these characters<br />so seriously. These are real to them.</i>
612487 614819 And there he'll be, just the way he was.
614906 618274 A smiling, happy little boy,<br />holding a new pet
618368 620735 and begging me to let him keep it.
621162 623474 CONLI: <i>We used to have a line here<br />when Doppler opened the door</i>
623498 625865 <i>where he said,<br />"In the dream, is the pet dead?"</i>
625959 628542 <i>Which was John's line,<br />but as it played,</i>
628628 632713 <i>it almost seemed like the audience was<br />ahead of it, and we didn't need the line.</i>
632799 634693 MUSKER: <i>And this is funny<br />'cause some people thought</i>
634717 635837 <i>when Billy said, "My chest!"</i>
635885 638114 <i>Like you got shot in the chest,<br />and if you look at the chest,</i>
638138 640675 <i>that spelling almost spells "Ron"<br />backwards and upside-down.</i>
640765 642535 CONLI: <i>Not deliberately,<br />it just sort of came out that way.</i>
642559 644495 MUSKER: <i>I think there will be<br />several lawsuits involving that</i>
644519 646135 <i>by the time you hear this commentary.</i>
646229 647310 CONLI: <i>By Ron?</i>
647397 648933 MUSKER: <i>Yeah. By someone.<br />I don't know.</i>
649315 652808 CONLI: <i>This was where we had our<br />first</i> Star Trek joke <i>in the movie.</i>
652902 656145 <i>There used to be Doppler examine<br />Bones and then he said the line,</i>
656239 657320 <i>"He's dead, Jim."</i>
657407 659819 <i>And it was a funny line<br />and some people really liked it,</i>
659909 662776 <i>but it felt like it wasn't right<br />for what was going on there,</i>
662871 666114 <i>the emotion was too serious,<br />so we took the line out.</i>
666207 669620 MUSKER: <i>These holo-blinds here<br />that sort of work like venetian blinds,</i>
669711 672373 <i>but they show off a different scene.</i>
672463 674921 <i>Tina Price,<br />our assistant artistic coordinator,</i>
675008 679047 <i>was involved in developing this idea,<br />as was Ian Gooding and Andy Gaskill,</i>
679137 681754 <i>and Dave Tidgwell on effects,</i>
681848 687093 <i>and it really was a fun visual way<br />to mask the bleak planet outside.</i>
687187 689039 <i>And I'll tell you, at one point<br />we had more different scenes</i>
689063 690124 <i>that they went through, I think,</i>
690148 692508 <i>where again, in the interest of time,<br />we don't have as many,</i>
692567 695309 <i>but we just liked the idea<br />that it was sort of</i>
695403 697690 <i>an analogous thing to a phenomenon<br />people know,</i>
697780 700272 <i>venetian blinds<br />with sort of a sci-fi twist to it.</i>
700366 702046 CONLI: <i>I like to call them<br />Venutian blinds.</i>
702076 703679 MUSKER: <i>Venutian blinds, right.<br />Venutian blinds.</i>
703703 705931 CLEMENTS: <i>We also used to have<br />a scene, a kind of dramatic scene</i>
705955 709368 <i>where the window<br />was blown to pieces,</i>
709459 712747 <i>shattered by the pirates<br />as they're bursting in the Benbow.</i>
712837 715204 <i>We took that out for various reasons,<br />but you will notice</i>
715298 721385 <i>that the window is there in the one<br />Doppler shot, and now it's shattered,</i>
721471 724384 <i>but we never actually<br />saw it shatter on screen.</i>
724474 726886 CONLI: <i>He's been bellyaching<br />about this for three months now.</i>
726976 729079 CLEMENTS: <i>I always liked that shot.<br />I always liked that shot.</i>
729103 731503 CLEMENTS: <i>I always liked that shot.<br />I always liked that shot.</i>
731814 734181 MUSKER: <i>Doppler's observatory.</i>
735318 737998 <i>A lot of the interior is based<br />on drawings that Michael Spooner did,</i>
738029 741397 <i>and they were really just trying to<br />set up this sort of eccentric bachelor,</i>
741491 744984 <i>but it had to serve different masters<br />in that we wanted Doppler</i>
745078 747139 <i>to be wealthy enough that he could<br />finance the expedition,</i>
747163 749780 <i>so we wanted a certain opulence<br />and scale to the place,</i>
749874 754038 <i>but also this sort of eccentricity and<br />this sort of scientific overlay to it all,</i>
754128 756586 <i>and we went through<br />a number of stages,</i>
756673 757858 <i>and yet we didn't want it to seem...</i>
757882 760486 <i>Some of the earlier drawings were<br />too cartoony, and we wanted it to fit</i>
760510 763093 <i>the rest of the style of the film<br />and not make it stand out.</i>
763179 765658 <i>So that was a bit of a struggle<br />for us to come up with something</i>
765682 771553 <i>that served all those ends, and<br />ultimately, I think it accomplished that</i>
771646 774013 <i>but it took a while to get there.</i>
774274 776686 <i>This is sort of a tour de force<br />of the effects animation</i>
776776 778517 <i>Dave Tidgwell<br />and his team supervised.</i>
778611 780089 <i>And Bill Konersman,<br />one of the effects guys,</i>
780113 783947 <i>worked on this for quite a while,<br />and just tried...</i>
784033 786011 <i>It was a fun sequence,<br />although it was one of those things,</i>
786035 787946 <i>in storyboards and in the script,</i>
788037 789348 <i>you're like,<br />"You have to take our word for it,</i>"
789372 790891 <i>"it's gonna look really cool<br />when it's done."</i>
790915 795580 <i>And people sometimes didn't realize that,<br />but it turned out really well, I think.</i>
795670 799208 GOODING: <i>Now, one of the interesting<br />things in the movie, color-wise,</i>
799299 802462 <i>is that we don't<br />use the color green a lot</i>
802552 805635 <i>because it associates<br />only with Treasure Planet,</i>
805722 809716 <i>so whenever you see green,<br />it represents good and moral,</i>
809809 814053 <i>and comfortable and, obviously,<br />exotic because Jim's home world</i>
814147 816138 <i>doesn't have any green,<br />so when you see the map,</i>
816232 819725 <i>it's all green<br />associating with Treasure Planet.</i>
820111 821977 This is the answer<br />to all our problems.
822238 824341 MUSKER: <i>There was a whole issue<br />of the flicker in the room,</i>
824365 826447 <i>we wanted this to feel<br />like it was a fire-lit room,</i>
826534 827615 <i>but the first pass on this,</i>
827702 830114 <i>it was so violent,<br />it seemed like the room was in flames,</i>
830204 833492 <i>and we had to go back several times<br />like, "Too much. ""Not enough."</i>
833583 836450 <i>And Tom Baker<br />and his scene planning crew</i>
836544 839912 <i>had to really back up<br />and go through this.</i>
840006 844045 CLEMENTS: <i>People take things like the<br />flicker for granted, but it was not easy.</i>
844135 847298 <i>It had to be redone several times<br />for continuity.</i>
847930 850171 MUSKER: <i>We did have to rewrite<br />this scene sometimes, too,</i>
850266 851882 <i>because we... There was a question,</i>
851976 854968 <i>"Why does Sarah let him go<br />on this big expedition?"</i>
855063 857771 <i>And we were rewriting<br />a number of times.</i>

905321 906507 MUSKER: <i>Yes.<br />All of the other animators</i>

907657 911571 <i>He's a brilliant draftsman, animator,<br />and impeccable in his timing,</i>
911661 914870 <i>his overlap, his technical skills<br />as well as his acting skills,</i>

919001 921584 <i>people working with him<br />had a high standard to live up to,</i>

932640 933826 CLEMENTS: <i>One of the<br />biggest shots in the movie.</i>
933850 934885 CONLI: <i>CGI shots.</i>
934976 937684 CLEMENTS: <i>Probably took,<br />how long to do this shot? Two years?</i>

942775 944561 <i>one of our designers.</i>
947071 950814 GOODING: <i>Amazing model<br />built by Thomas Debitus.</i>
950908 952899 <i>Incredibly fun concept, I thought.</i>
952994 956157 <i>This was one of the earliest concepts<br />that the directors came up with,</i>
956247 960912 <i>and I just think it's a really fun,<br />magical storybook conceit</i>
961002 963790 <i>that the moon is really just a crescent,</i>
963880 967839 <i>and one of the things that really<br />attracted me to the movie, initially.</i>
967925 970633 KEANE: <i>Rick Maki<br />is a character designer</i>
970720 973428 <i>who worked on this movie<br />almost as long as we did.</i>
973514 975194 <i>Rick did, literally,<br />thousands of drawings.</i>
975266 978224 <i>He did aliens<br />of every possible persuasion.</i>
978311 981599 <i>And this spaceport sequence<br />was sort of a tour de force</i>

986611 989069 <i>Some have got tentacles, some fly,<br />some walk, whatever,</i>
989155 992147 <i>but Rick,<br />just a brilliantly inventive mind.</i>
992283 994866 Familiarity breeds,<br />well, contempt, but in our case...
994952 998741 Look, let's just find the ship. Okay?
999999 1000309 MUSKER: <i>This is our special<br />Hitchcockian cameo.</i>
1000333 1002244 MUSKER: <i>This is our special<br />Hitchcockian cameo.</i>
1002335 1005043 <i>That skinny, frail robot up there<br />is me, John.</i>
1005129 1008463 CLEMENTS: <i>And the little, hairy,<br />red-haired guy is me, Ron.</i>
1008549 1011667 <i>It started with</i> Aladdin <i>accidentally.<br />We did a little cameo in</i> Aladdin,
1011761 1013071 <i>and then we did one in</i> Hercules,<br /><i>so we felt</i>
1013095 1014907 <i>-we had to do one in this, too.</i><br />-MUSKER: <i>We did the dialogue</i>
1014931 1016033 <i>here, as well, as we did in those.</i>
1016057 1018594 <i>-"Second berth on your right."<br />-"You can't miss it."</i>
1018684 1020345 MUSKER: <i>Boy. Is that acting?</i>
1020436 1022677 <i>-Don't answer that question.</i><br />-CLEMENTS: <i>Okay.</i>
1024398 1025792 MUSKER: <i>So, this is our ship,<br />the</i> Legacy,
1025816 1027169 <i>that went through many name changes</i>
1027193 1029605 <i>on the course of arriving<br />where it was here.</i>
1029862 1032775 CLEMENTS: <i>I think we had a contest<br />at some point to name the ship.</i>
1032865 1035698 <i>Originally, we toyed with the idea<br />of using the</i> Hispaniola,
1035785 1036803 <i>which is the name<br />of the ship in the book.</i>
1036827 1039097 MUSKER: <i>I wanted to use that name.</i><br />CLEMENTS: <i>John wanted to do that.</i>
1039121 1040282 <i>I didn't want to use that.</i>
1040373 1041454 MUSKER: <i>I wanted to.</i>
1041541 1044579 CLEMENTS: <i>Finally, we ended up<br />with</i> Legacy, <i>which I think</i>
1044669 1049709 <i>it was Glen Gagnon who came<br />up with the</i> Legacy.
1049799 1051790 MUSKER: <i>That was his legacy.</i><br />CLEMENTS: <i>Exactly.</i>
1051884 1054717 <i>And we should talk a little bit<br />about Mr. Snuff,</i>
1054804 1058593 <i>the voice of that and the animation<br />is done by Adam Dykstra.</i>
1058683 1061675 <i>One of the rare cases<br />where an animator actually</i>
1061769 1064636 <i>animates the character<br />and supplied the voice.</i>
1064730 1066220 <i>How he did it, we're not quite sure.</i>
1066315 1069057 <i>I think that he used this stuff called Gak</i>
1069151 1072485 <i>but he was always by himself<br />in the recording session,</i>
1072572 1074609 <i>so we don't know for sure.</i>
1075283 1077163 MUSKER: <i>Captain Amelia,<br />voiced by Emma Thompson.</i>
1077243 1080235 <i>Emma was great to work with,<br />and animated by Ken Duncan,</i>
1080329 1082570 <i>one of the best draftsmen at the studio.</i>
1082665 1085532 <i>We recorded all of her, I guess,<br />in London,</i>
1085626 1089085 <i>and she really came into the sessions,<br />having looked at the lines,</i>
1089171 1091817 <i>and with ideas for rewrites,<br />and it was always fun working with her,</i>
1091841 1095129 <i>because we sat down<br />and actually hashed out the lines.</i>
1095219 1097551 CLEMENTS: <i>She's a great writer<br />as well as an actress.</i>
1097638 1101097 CONLI: <i>Literally, we would sit down<br />each sequence at a time, go through it,</i>
1101183 1103641 <i>-and then go into the recording booth.</i><br />-MUSKER: <i>Right.</i>
1103728 1104843 CONLI: <i>Always beplussed us.</i>
1104937 1107645 MUSKER: <i>Right. She came up<br />with a particular word or something</i>
1107732 1111100 <i>that would just make it<br />very British, very precise,</i>
1111193 1113685 <i>and very much in character for her.</i>
1115197 1117593 <i>Captain Amelia, the captain of the ship,<br />is based on Captain Smollett</i>
1117617 1119278 <i>from Robert Louis Stevenson's novel.</i>
1119368 1120679 <i>Of course, in the novel, he's a man,</i>
1120703 1123661 <i>as, I think, just about all ship captains<br />were in that era.</i>
1123748 1125489 <i>Ted and Terry,<br />Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio,</i>
1125583 1128450 <i>when they did their treatment<br />based on Ron's original treatment,</i>
1128544 1131161 <i>thought the captain could be a woman,<br />sort of a woman alien,</i>
1131255 1134151 <i>and I think they described her as a<br />bird-like alien in their original treatment</i>
1134175 1136633 <i>but we liked the idea<br />of a female captain.</i>
1136719 1138835 <i>It just gave a whole twist to the story,</i>
1138929 1142297 <i>and we then wrote the part<br />with Emma Thompson in mind,</i>
1142391 1143910 <i>never knowing whether or not<br />she would do it,</i>
1143934 1145345 <i>but her kind of wittiness,</i>
1145436 1148098 <i>and take-chargeness,<br />and authoritativeness</i>
1148189 1152308 <i>and intelligence, we thought would be<br />great coupled with this sort of...</i>
1152401 1154688 <i>And there's an element of Emma Peel<br />in there, slightly...</i>
1154779 1157111 CLEMENTS: <i>I remember in the<br />first draft of the script,</i>
1157198 1159030 <i>we described Amelia as a combination</i>
1159116 1161574 <i>between Emma Peel<br />and Mary Poppins.</i>
1162036 1165904 <i>And there's still a little of that,<br />I think, that comes through.</i>
1165998 1168330 GOODING: <i>This set<br />is Amelia's state room.</i>
1168918 1172661 <i>We tried to come up<br />with a very soft lighting situation,</i>
1172755 1175713 <i>so that the characters<br />would not require tones.</i>
1175800 1180169 <i>Tones are the shadows<br />on the actual characters</i>
1180262 1184847 <i>that render them more dimensional,<br />and they take a lot of time,</i>
1184934 1189519 <i>and since this movie had a lot<br />of very cool effects sequences,</i>
1189605 1193940 <i>we didn't want to tie up the effects<br />people with doing too many tones,</i>
1194026 1196108 <i>so we tried to come up<br />with lighting situations</i>
1196195 1198527 <i>that would be better without the tones,</i>
1198614 1201777 <i>rather than having a movie<br />that just looked cheap.</i>
1202618 1203824 <i>Um...</i>
1204120 1206908 <i>We have a nice sort of<br />photographic light effect</i>
1206997 1209955 <i>happening here on the characters,<br />which we called "overspill,"</i>
1210042 1214036 <i>which happens when you<br />take a picture into a light source.</i>
1214130 1216713 <i>The edges of the characters<br />and backgrounds</i>
1216799 1220008 <i>get chewed away a bit<br />by the light behind them,</i>
1220636 1224630 <i>which is that sort of nice haze you see<br />working around the edges.</i>
1225266 1227553 Mr. Arrow, please escort<br />these two neophytes
1227643 1228923 down to the galley straightaway.
1228978 1231640 Young Hawkins will be working<br />for our cook, Mr. Silver.
1231731 1233642 What? The cook?
1235276 1237608 CLEMENTS: <i>So this sequence,<br />which is actually</i>
1237695 1239481 <i>the introduction of John Silver,</i>
1239572 1242155 <i>was actually one of the first scenes<br />animated in the movie,</i>
1242241 1243552 <i>one of the first to come out of story,</i>
1243576 1246364 <i>Barry Johnson did the storyboards<br />on this sequence,</i>
1246454 1250823 <i>and so a lot of this is some<br />of the first animation that was done.</i>
1250916 1253658 <i>This is like the first scene<br />that was animated on Silver</i>
1253753 1256541 <i>'cause Glen Keane, who did Silver,<br />kind of went in order,</i>
1256630 1259713 <i>and I think that was the second scene<br />that was animated.</i>
1259800 1262713 KEANE: <i>Silver is a<br />very unique character</i>
1262803 1264443 <i>in that he's the first time<br />we've animated</i>
1264513 1270099 <i>a character that's traditional<br />hand drawn and computer generated</i>
1270186 1271802 <i>in the same character.</i>
1271896 1274103 <i>And we really wondered,</i>
1274190 1277103 <i>"ls the audience going to believe this<br />character is real?"</i>
1277193 1280652 <i>"Is it going to look like he's got<br />metal pieces stuck onto him,"</i>
1280738 1285073 <i>"and they don't belong, they're not part<br />of his being? Are they going to buy it?"</i>
1285159 1289744 <i>And I was very happy to find that<br />the biggest challenges with Silver</i>
1289830 1293573 <i>were not the technical,<br />sticking a CG part onto him,</i>
1293667 1294748 <i>but as it should be,</i>
1294835 1298544 <i>it was the acting, the performance.<br />How do you make him real?</i>
1299340 1304710 <i>Right from the start, I knew that I could<br />do the hand-drawn part,</i>
1304804 1309093 <i>but I wasn't going to step into territory<br />that I wasn't comfortable with,</i>
1309183 1312426 <i>and Eric Daniels, who I had worked<br />closely with on</i> Tarzan,
1312520 1314636 <i>and he created the deep canvas look</i>
1314730 1317518 <i>with the jungle being able<br />to move in dimension.</i>
1317608 1320270 <i>And I just felt like<br />this guy is an inventor,</i>
1320361 1323319 <i>and we need somebody<br />doing the mechanical arm</i>
1323405 1327444 <i>who's not just a technician<br />and an animator, but an inventor.</i>
1328327 1331945 CONLI: <i>Probably good to note right<br />now the performance by Brian Murray,</i>
1332039 1333746 <i>which is just phenomenal.</i>
1333833 1337497 <i>It's probably one of the best voice<br />performances we've had at Disney.</i>
1338838 1340249 (LAUGHING)
1341590 1347336 KEANE: <i>Brian's voice, it comes from<br />somewhere way down inside of him,</i>
1347429 1353641 <i>and he can go from very light<br />and jovial, feels very sincere,</i>
1353727 1357595 <i>and just as easily switch<br />into a dark, ominous side</i>
1357690 1360648 <i>that you find just as believable,<br />which had to work for Silver,</i>
1360734 1365149 <i>that you had to genuinely believe that<br />this was a man who was torn</i>
1365239 1370109 <i>between the greed and lust<br />for this treasure</i>
1370202 1374446 <i>and a genuine compassion that he's<br />beginning to feel for Jim Hawkins.</i>
1375291 1378204 CLEMENTS: <i>Mike Show<br />did the animation on Morph,</i>
1378294 1379876 <i>and he studied lava lamps.</i>
1379962 1383830 MUSKER: <i>It was the cross between<br />a puppy dog and a lava lamp.</i>
1384758 1388001 <i>Mike didn't have a puppy dog,<br />but he actually has a little, at the time,</i>
1388095 1389506 <i>a little son, maybe a year old,</i>
1389597 1391964 <i>so he tried to get<br />some of his son's expressions in this.</i>
1392057 1394139 CONLI: <i>It's like a puppy dog.</i><br />CLEMENTS: <i>Yeah, it is.</i>
1394226 1398265 <i>And Dane Davis, our sound designer,<br />who's a great sound designer,</i>
1398355 1400938 <i>he actually provided<br />the voice for Morph.</i>
1401108 1402794 MUSKER: <i>We're about to move<br />into this area now</i>
1402818 1405150 <i>where we tried to feature what's called<br />the virtual set,</i>
1405237 1407820 <i>where we built this whole<br />galley in the computer</i>
1407907 1410990 <i>and then rendered it and painted it<br />with deep canvas techniques,</i>
1411076 1412888 <i>such that we could move the camera<br />around and in it,</i>
1412912 1415028 <i>and this was sort of a unique use</i>
1415122 1418240 <i>because it wasn't<br />a bravura action scene,</i>
1418334 1420937 <i>it was more of a personality scene,<br />and we were trying to build tension</i>
1420961 1422522 <i>by the way the camera moves<br />in the scene.</i>
1422546 1425307 CLEMENTS: <i>There it starts to move,<br />and that is a three-dimensional set</i>
1425341 1427503 <i>painted to look<br />like a painted background.</i>
1427676 1430714 Who be a humble cyborg<br />to argue with a captain?
1430804 1433387 KEANE: <i>This moment,<br />I thought was, for me,</i>
1433474 1436967 <i>one of the most enjoyable acting<br />moments I've ever had</i>
1437061 1439143 <i>working at Disney,<br />working with you on this one.</i>
1439229 1442938 RIPA: <i>Yeah, this whole sequence<br />is interesting, but this scene actually...</i>
1443025 1447610 <i>Normally, the process is<br />you work on your characters yourself</i>
1447696 1450108 <i>in your room<br />at a separate time, usually,</i>
1450199 1454944 <i>and for that scene,<br />Glen and I actually worked</i>
1455037 1457529 <i>on the scene at the same time<br />at the same desk.</i>
1457623 1460911 <i>He would go up and do a drawing,<br />and he'd step back and we'd act it out,</i>
1461001 1463117 <i>and then I'd step up<br />and I'd do a drawing.</i>
1463212 1466375 KEANE: <i>Fortunately, John draws<br />at his desk standing up.</i>
1466465 1468465 <i>Everybody else sits in a chair,<br />but John stands up,</i>
1468509 1472719 <i>so we can actually do this<br />tag-team animating pretty easily.</i>
1472805 1475843 RIPA: <i>Yeah, it was pretty cool,<br />and this was some of the first</i>
1475933 1477674 <i>stuff that we did on the character,</i>
1477768 1481136 <i>and it's so huge<br />in terms of their relationship,</i>
1481230 1483437 <i>and the play back and forth.</i>
1483524 1486562 <i>Just the contact between them<br />and the interaction,</i>
1486652 1490520 <i>and keeping it going from this point<br />'cause it seemed like such a nice setup</i>
1490614 1493652 <i>between them<br />that trying to keep that in mind</i>
1493742 1498361 <i>whenever they're on screen and how<br />they relate and really working together</i>
1498455 1502244 <i>closely and knowing each other's<br />characters, I think, really helped.</i>
1504378 1506710 We're all clear, Captain!
1507756 1511670 CLEMENTS: <i>Early on, I think we've<br />always considered that these ships,</i>
1511760 1514218 <i>we would be using solar power a lot.</i>
1514304 1518013 <i>The technology of this universe<br />relies a lot on solar power</i>
1518100 1521593 <i>and artificial gravity.<br />Those are two of their big things.</i>
1521687 1523707 MUSKER: <i>Well, we always said<br />we wanted this to feel almost like</i>
1523731 1528567 <i>if they had discovered solar power<br />like in the 17th century</i>
1528652 1531189 <i>on a major scale<br />and really developed it,</i>
1531280 1533271 <i>this was where<br />they would have gotten then.</i>
1533365 1535427 <i>I think Andy Gaskill did some<br />of the early drawings on this</i>
1535451 1537732 <i>where he did these sort of hexagonal<br />patterns in the sails</i>
1537786 1540369 <i>which we really liked<br />in terms of just feeling like there was</i>
1540456 1544324 <i>this sort of fiber filament that<br />was a conduit in these things.</i>
1545294 1548878 GOODING: <i>We did a lot of research<br />on the color of ships,</i>
1548964 1551877 <i>how they were painted<br />back in the 18th century,</i>
1551967 1554425 <i>and settled, eventually,<br />on a white hull for the ship</i>
1554511 1558049 <i>because, several reasons,<br />it shows up very nicely</i>
1558140 1562259 <i>against the dark-colored backgrounds,<br />and also it picks up color.</i>
1562352 1567392 <i>White is a very good reflector<br />of what's happening around it,</i>
1567483 1572523 <i>so when it's in a colorful Etherium<br />that actually reflects onto the hull,</i>
1572613 1574695 <i>and it's really attractive.</i>
1577826 1581990 MUSKER: <i>This shot of the ship<br />with the manta birds swooping by</i>
1582081 1584743 <i>was based on a painting<br />that Ian Gooding did of the ship,</i>
1584833 1587291 <i>and these birds going by,<br />and it was just a majestic image.</i>
1587377 1588813 CONLI: <i>it was one of the<br />really early paintings,</i>
1588837 1591920 <i>and it really set a tone<br />for the whole movie.</i>
1592007 1593777 MUSKER: <i>it was sort of an icon,<br />and it was just</i>
1593801 1595153 <i>based on a visual development thing,</i>
1595177 1596988 <i>and we said, "We've got to get that<br />image into the movie."</i>
1597012 1598823 <i>So we really tried to duplicate<br />the feeling of that,</i>
1598847 1601088 <i>and I'm really happy<br />with the way it turned out.</i>
1601183 1604141 <i>The manta birds,<br />animated by Mark Austin.</i>
1604228 1605455 CLEMENTS: <i>I think there is one frame</i>
1605479 1608221 <i>that pretty much<br />matches the painting very closely.</i>
1608315 1610515 MUSKER: <i>It was really<br />Ian Gooding's vision of that image</i>
1610567 1612934 <i>that we really tried to duplicate on film.</i>
1613028 1614644 CLEMENTS:<br /><i>Deep canvas space whales.</i>
1614738 1617696 <i>These are the first characters that<br />Disney has ever done in deep canvas.</i>
1617783 1621572 CONLI: <i>Except for the manta birds,<br />but you don't notice them as much.</i>
1621662 1624996 <i>These take full advantage of that,<br />so they're painted like backgrounds</i>
1626041 1629124 <i>but animated as computer animation.</i>
1629211 1631452 MUSKER: <i>This scene was<br />a little bit of a struggle</i>
1631547 1634790 <i>because Doppler<br />was gonna be kind of slimed</i>
1634883 1636248 <i>by these whales and we discussed</i>
1636343 1639301 <i>what was the funny color<br />of this sort of slime</i>
1639388 1642221 <i>and went through various ones<br />and we wound up with...</i>
1642307 1644139 <i>This was our funny color.</i>
1644560 1648303 KEANE: <i>These scenes,<br />Marc Smith animated, who just became</i>
1648397 1651935 <i>my right hand man<br />on animating Long John Silver.</i>
1653402 1656440 <i>He has a natural appeal.</i>
1656530 1659568 <i>Appeal is something that I used to hear<br />all the time</i>
1659658 1662366 <i>from Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnson,<br />Eric Larson,</i>
1662452 1664864 <i>the old guys who did</i><br />Pinocchio, Snow White.
1664955 1667572 <i>They were always talking about<br />appeal and sincerity.</i>
1667666 1670909 <i>And the word "appeal"<br />I haven't heard as much lately,</i>
1673255 1675667 <i>and looking at Marc's work,<br />it reminded me</i>
1675757 1677964 <i>of how important that is.<br />It's a natural thing.</i>
1678093 1683429 <i>You're born with this ability to just draw<br />and all the parts are in the right place,</i>
1683515 1687258 <i>and you are attracted to that character.</i>
1687853 1691847 CONLI: <i>It's interesting to note that<br />in the development process,</i>
1691940 1694682 <i>both in terms of characters<br />and backgrounds,</i>
1694776 1699521 <i>that we have about 15,000 pieces<br />of artwork that were developed</i>
1699615 1702949 <i>during the period<br />before we got into production.</i>
1703035 1705572 <i>So there's a lot of artwork<br />that gets generated</i>
1705662 1708404 <i>just in terms of spawning ideas</i>
1708498 1713709 <i>and massive amounts of character stuff<br />and background stuff.</i>
1713795 1715273 MUSKER: <i>A lot of this<br />cast of characters,</i>
1715297 1717755 <i>we really wanted to get<br />a range of shapes and sizes</i>
1717841 1720629 <i>in this supporting cast<br />of pirates and species.</i>
1720719 1722780 <i>And Peter De Sève was<br />fairly instrumental in doing that,</i>
1722804 1725466 <i>the character designer who did these<br />really fun designs,</i>
1725557 1729016 <i>little tentacled people<br />and huge hulking people</i>
1729102 1731434 <i>and the spidery guy and all that.</i>
1731521 1734513 <i>He kicked off a lot of that stuff,<br />and much of what he did,</i>
1734608 1738567 <i>Andy adapted and we adapted<br />and the animators jumped off from.</i>
1739446 1742939 CLEMENTS: <i>And Mr. Scroop here,<br />voiced my Michael Wincott,</i>
1743033 1744740 <i>who has a terrific voice.</i>
1744826 1747568 <i>Actually, originally, we had<br />a different voice for Scroop,</i>
1747663 1754000 <i>a different actor who was doing more<br />of a raspy, insectoid kind of voice,</i>
1754419 1757081 <i>and it didn't quite work, I think.</i>
1757172 1759525 <i>It didn't quite feel right<br />and so we went with Michael Wincott</i>
1759549 1762917 <i>and we're not doing anything<br />to his voice. It's a great voice.</i>
1763011 1765969 <i>And another one of<br />the character designers</i>
1766056 1769424 <i>was Eric Pigors who did<br />a lot of these characters.</i>
1769518 1774479 <i>His style was a little bit reminiscent<br />of Big Daddy Roth.</i>
1774564 1776601 <i>People from the '60s<br />may remember that.</i>
1776692 1781357 <i>And he's particularly represented with<br />the one alien with the one eye</i>
1781446 1783278 <i>that sticks out.</i>
1783365 1785426 MUSKER: <i>That was Eric's design<br />and we called him Pigors</i>
1785450 1787942 <i>in honor of Eric himself.</i>
1788870 1790390 CLEMENTS: <i>And we should<br />mention Mr. Arrow.</i>
1790414 1791779 <i>We haven't talked about Mr. Arrow,</i>
1791873 1793614 <i>voiced by Roscoe Lee Browne</i>
1793709 1795120 <i>who did a great, great job,</i>
1795210 1797292 <i>and T. Dan Hofstedt did the animation.</i>
1797379 1798540 MUSKER: <i>Right.</i>
1799339 1802502 <i>Yeah, we really liked, sort of,<br />the reserve that he animated with</i>
1802592 1806085 <i>and gave him that kind of solidity<br />and stolidity</i>
1806179 1808341 <i>and really made him...</i>
1808432 1811094 CONLI: <i>T. Dan's a real genius<br />at understatement.</i>
1811184 1813972 MUSKER: <i>Yeah. Yeah, he did<br />the emperor in</i> Mulan
1814062 1816520 <i>and found a lot to work with<br />a little on that as well.</i>
1817190 1819522 Hey, I was doing it until that bug thing...
1819609 1820609 Belay that!
1821695 1824653 CLEMENTS: <i>You mentioned Jim's<br />eye mask, which you just sort of notice.</i>
1824740 1827698 <i>I mean, he's had this little shadow<br />around his eyes</i>
1827784 1829775 <i>throughout the movie.<br />It's kind of a trademark,</i>
1829870 1833329 <i>along with his jacket that<br />makes him feel kind of internalized</i>
1833415 1835622 <i>and gives that dark,<br />brooding sort of edge,</i>
1835709 1839327 <i>presumably, the eye mask<br />actually becomes a thematic element</i>
1839421 1840911 <i>in the movie.</i>
1844593 1847551 <i>This section actually<br />started out much longer,</i>
1847637 1849344 <i>had a lot more exposition in it.</i>
1850057 1851297 <i>Then it got taken out.</i>
1851391 1854975 <i>We cut it out of the movie<br />completely at one point</i>
1855062 1857144 <i>to sort of keep<br />more mystery about Silver.</i>
1857230 1860473 <i>And then we ended up putting it<br />back in, in a much shortened version.</i>
1861568 1863921 MUSKER: <i>Also our movies are always<br />running... They have too much story</i>
1863945 1866733 <i>or they run too long,<br />and we wind up having to look for cuts,</i>
1866823 1869736 <i>and it's always difficult for us<br />to figure out</i>
1869826 1872033 <i>what we can cut,<br />what exposition can you cut</i>
1872120 1874040 <i>and still make the audience<br />understand the story.</i>
1874122 1876204 CLEMENTS: <i>We cut a lot<br />of exposition from this.</i>
1876291 1878703 <i>Here he used to talk about Billy Bones,</i>
1878794 1880876 <i>he talked about<br />why they needed the Captain</i>
1880962 1882857 <i>-to run the ship.</i><br />-CONLI: <i>You really spelled it out.</i>
1882881 1886294 CLEMENTS: <i>And now it's pretty much<br />down to bare basics.</i>
1889388 1890924 (LAUGHING)
1891932 1896392 <i>This little bit with Morph here where<br />he turns into a little version of Scroop</i>
1896478 1898389 <i>was added just as a gag</i>
1898480 1902223 <i>and it just seemed a way of kind of<br />de-demonizing Scroop</i>
1902317 1904604 <i>to sort of make fun of<br />the boogeyman a little bit here.</i>
1904694 1908904 <i>So we added this and Mike Show<br />animated a very funny...</i>
1908990 1910572 <i>With his little Nijinsky move there.</i>
1910659 1913697 CONLI: <i>You can see Jim's<br />eye mask pretty clearly there.</i>
1913787 1915369 <i>Dark brooding eye mask.</i>
1915455 1919699 <i>And Silver's striped pants turned into<br />a little bit of a nightmare, too,</i>
1919793 1923127 <i>because they were<br />very difficult to draw.</i>
1923797 1924941 MUSKER: <i>So the clean-up people,</i>
1924965 1927081 <i>"Vera Pacheco,<br />was pleading with us, "Please don't,</i>
1927175 1928986 <i>"let's not do the striped pants<br />through the whole movie."</i>
1929010 1931923 <i>So we found a convenient spot<br />for him to go into a changing room,</i>
1932013 1934973 <i>and during the latter half of the movie,<br />he has remarkably unstriped pants,</i>
1935016 1937508 <i>which I don't think anyone ever notices.</i>
1937602 1939513 <i>But he has more than one<br />pair of pants, right?</i>
1940355 1941390 CONLI: <i>Sure.</i>
1941523 1943764 Your father not the teachin' sort?
1944693 1945728 No.
1945819 1948402 CLEMENTS: <i>Once again, there was<br />some rewriting on this scene,</i>
1948488 1953107 <i>just the question of how much to reveal<br />about Jim's father and what happened,</i>
1953201 1955909 <i>and how much to leave<br />for the song to reveal.</i>
1955996 1960115 <i>It's still leading into this father-son<br />arc, this surrogate father-surrogate son,</i>

1964880 1967963 The captain has put you in my charge,<br />like it or not.
1968133 1971842 MUSKER: <i>The montage<br />that we're entering into</i>
1972762 1975550 <i>was in the film for a long time,<br />but originally it had</i>
1975640 1978678 <i>a different temp song behind it.<br />It had a U2 song behind it,</i>
1978768 1982386 <i>and it featured other sort of visuals,<br />and we went through a lot on that.</i>
1982481 1985143 <i>Ultimately, Glen Keane<br />went and re-boarded it</i>
1985233 1985918 <i>and really changed it around<br />into what you see now.</i>
1985942 1987942 <i>And really changed it around<br />into what you see now.</i>
1988028 1989985 <i>We delved more into Jim's back-story.</i>
1990071 1993154 CLEMENTS: <i>And even before he<br />re-boarded it, I think it was Glen's idea</i>
1993241 1996154 <i>to actually put the song</i><br />Iris <i>by the Goo Goo Dolls</i>
1996244 2000203 <i>in as a temp track instead of<br />the U2 song, which we did.</i>
2000290 2002059 CONLI: <i>Glen really brought<br />Johnny Rzeznik to our attention.</i>

2003251 2004312 <i>who's the lead singer<br />of the Goo Goo Dolls</i>
2004336 2007499 <i>and kind of its central core member,<br />came in, we met with him.</i>
2007589 2010206 <i>We discovered that he actually<br />had a lot in common with Jim,</i>
2010300 2012667 <i>just in terms of his background,<br />growing up in Buffalo,</i>
2012761 2017255 <i>and his relationship with his father,<br />and just a guarded and troubled youth</i>
2017349 2019306 <i>who sort of came out of it<br />on the other side.</i>
2019392 2022134 CLEMENTS: <i>With a mentor's help.<br />I mean, a lot of parallels.</i>
2022229 2023344 MUSKER: <i>Right.</i>
2023438 2026772 <i>And so he performed the song<br />that he wrote here for us in a room</i>
2026858 2029475 <i>before he had lyrics,<br />so he would just lean over Roy, and,</i>
2029569 2032402 <i>"Hey," you know, just sort of...</i><br />(MUMBLING)
2032489 2034776 CLEMENTS: <i>He did this sort of<br />Bob Dylan thing.</i>
2034866 2036231 MUSKER: <i>A little Bob Dylan-y,</i>
2036326 2038442 <i>and Angela Lepito<br />was filming the whole thing.</i>
2038537 2040778 <i>You can talk to her<br />about the tape, yeah.</i>
2040872 2043159 CONLI: <i>The whole idea here<br />of the flashbacks</i>
2043250 2044786 <i>was actually Glen Keane's idea.</i>
2044876 2046537 <i>That wasn't part of the original story.</i>
2046628 2050371 <i>This was originally just sort of<br />a Disney mentoring sequence,</i>
2050465 2053924 <i>but Glen had the idea of,<br />"Let's take this into Jim's past</i>"
2054010 2056126 <i>"and kind of show<br />what really happened."</i>
2056221 2057573 CONLI: <i>I think it's a testament to Glen</i>
2057597 2060430 <i>because here's the guy<br />who's the lead animator for Silver,</i>
2060517 2063305 <i>and then he's able to kind of<br />get into Jim's mind as well.</i>
2063395 2064830 MUSKER: <i>Well, the core<br />of this whole movie</i>
2064854 2066891 <i>is Jim and Silver, their relationship,</i>
2066982 2071317 <i>and I think Glen and John were both<br />intimately involved in developing that.</i>
2071403 2074987 KEANE: <i>I remember,<br />I had to storyboard this</i>
2075073 2076780 <i>and it just wasn't working,</i>
2076866 2080609 <i>but I felt in my gut<br />that we had to do these flashbacks.</i>
2081329 2084572 <i>So I left the studio<br />and went up to Lake Arrowhead,</i>
2084666 2088125 <i>about two hours from here,<br />and just sat up there and thought,</i>
2088211 2093001 <i>"Okay, if I was just going to do this<br />just the way Rzeznik wrote it,"</i>
2093091 2094752 <i>"this is what it would be."</i>
2094843 2096443 <i>But I wasn't sure if this<br />was gonna work,</i>
2096511 2100254 <i>so I called my wife<br />and I started to describe this,</i>
2100348 2102055 <i>and there was this silence<br />on the phone.</i>
2102142 2104133 <i>I said, "What, you don't like it?"</i>
2104227 2106218 <i>She said, "No, I'm crying."</i>
2107314 2110352 <i>"Well, then I'm gonna do it.<br />That's how it has to be."</i>
2112068 2115106 CLEMENTS: <i>I think it's interesting,<br />Johnny is just amazing</i>
2115196 2119565 <i>in terms of being able to interpret<br />the dramatic structure of a film</i>
2119659 2120774 <i>into the music.</i>
2120869 2124612 <i>I mean, he really gets the concept<br />of what the story is about</i>
2124706 2128119 <i>and he's able to kind of<br />transfer that pretty easily into...</i>
2128209 2132498 <i>And his lyrics are very strong, I think,</i>
2132589 2135957 <i>and really express a lot<br />of the underlying things</i>
2136051 2139089 <i>that we wanted to get through<br />in the character of Jim.</i>
2141389 2144427 MUSKER: <i>We're about to get into<br />this whole sequence where they...</i>
2144517 2148556 <i>After Jim sees his father<br />leaving for the last time,</i>
2149606 2150971 <i>now Silver invites him on board,</i>
2151066 2153026 <i>where he's going to<br />show him the ropes of driving,</i>
2153068 2155400 <i>and then Jim takes over.<br />And I think it was Glen's idea</i>
2155487 2157069 <i>to really work in<br />something with a comet</i>
2157155 2159442 <i>or something that just had<br />a spectacular visual to it.</i>
2159532 2163150 <i>So that became the basis for this<br />last little movement within the song</i>
2163244 2165736 <i>where Jim really takes Silver<br />kind of on this joy ride</i>
2165830 2168242 <i>and shows him that<br />he really knows what he's doing.</i>
2169709 2171541 CLEMENTS: <i>Sky continuity<br />was a nightmare.</i>
2171628 2173606 MUSKER: <i>Maybe we should also<br />talk about the size of stars, too.</i>
2173630 2176918 CLEMENTS: <i>Stars and sky.<br />We've said many times on this,</i>
2177008 2180797 <i>"if we ever do another movie again,<br />we don't want to have any sky,"</i>
2180887 2182753 <i>"or any clouds, or any stars."</i>
2182847 2185384 <i>It's just too complicated.</i>
2186267 2188008 <i>And there again,<br />people take it for granted,</i>
2188103 2190219 <i>like, if they look the same in every shot,</i>
2190313 2192975 <i>and they're moving<br />at the same speed in every shot...</i>
2193066 2195228 <i>And it doesn't always happen,</i>
2195318 2200529 <i>because somehow continuity<br />is very, very difficult to keep going.</i>
2200615 2203277 <i>And this movie, I think, is probably<br />one of the most complicated</i>
2203368 2203511 <i>in terms of continuity<br />and trying to match from shot to shot.</i>
2203535 2206698 <i>In terms of continuity<br />and trying to match from shot to shot.</i>
2206788 2208654 <i>And we had to redo a lot of these skies.</i>
2208748 2211468 CONLI: <i>Well, basically, you're<br />just sticklers on continuity.</i> (LAUGHS)
2212293 2214079 MUSKER: <i>No one will ever notice.</i>
2215296 2216565 GOODING: <i>Now, this scene<br />ends up having</i>
2216589 2220833 <i>a very Brandywine School<br />of illustration look to it</i>
2220927 2225137 <i>because of the pool of light that we use<br />to stage the two characters in.</i>
2225223 2228090 <i>It's a very nice balance<br />of warm and cool here.</i>
2228184 2231347 <i>It sort of spotlights the two characters</i>
2231438 2234351 <i>and focuses your attention<br />on them nicely.</i>
2234441 2236377 CONLI: <i>Well, this is, I think,<br />some of the best acting</i>
2236401 2238108 <i>-in the film.</i><br />-MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>
2238194 2239901 <i>Rick Hoppe did a number<br />of these scenes</i>
2239988 2241132 <i>of Silver and Jim at the beginning</i>
2241156 2243272 <i>and then Dean Wellins<br />did the latter half.</i>
2243366 2248736 <i>And really just some great<br />acting moments, I think, from Dean.</i>
2248830 2252073 <i>This was a subtlety in thought process.</i>
2252167 2255205 <i>Yeah, Dean Wellins was an animator<br />who worked at Warner Brothers,</i>
2255295 2259630 <i>and was a schoolmate of<br />John Ripa's and Sergio Pablo's,</i>
2259716 2262708 <i>and this is the first Disney film<br />he's worked on,</i>
2262802 2266011 <i>and he just was an outstanding talent.</i>
2266097 2270807 CONLI: <i>The whole Silver team<br />and the Jim unit was just amazing.</i>
2270894 2272872 CLEMENTS: <i>That scene of Jim<br />was just beautifully acted.</i>
2272896 2276355 <i>And this scene of Silver, I think,<br />is one of the best scenes in the movie</i>
2276441 2278899 <i>in terms of how well the acting...</i>
2278985 2281022 MUSKER: <i>Yeah. It's amazing.</i>
2281529 2283299 KEANE: <i>And something that we tried<br />on this picture</i>
2283323 2287408 <i>was to have a crew, a shared crew,<br />between John and I</i>
2287494 2290828 <i>where some of the animators<br />would do both characters,</i>
2290914 2294953 <i>just so that they would understand<br />the relationship that much better.</i>
2295043 2296979 RIPA: <i>And that, hopefully, yeah,<br />that that would make</i>
2297003 2299665 <i>the relationship on screen<br />come across better.</i>
2301424 2303290 CONLI: <i>The storm sequence<br />is a real showcase</i>
2303384 2308254 <i>for our head of layout, Rasoul Azadani,<br />and head of effects, Dave Tidgwell.</i>
2309224 2311886 <i>It was great, in terms of doing<br />an action-adventure movie,</i>
2311976 2314968 <i>I think it was exciting for Rasoul<br />to work with virtual sets.</i>
2315063 2317270 <i>This is the first movie<br />where we were really able</i>
2317357 2319940 <i>to move the camera<br />through environments.</i>
2320026 2323894 <i>And Rasoul is sort of the equivalent<br />of a live-action cinematographer,</i>
2323988 2326650 <i>so it was really a freeing thing for him</i>
2326741 2329733 <i>to be able to move the camera<br />wherever we wanted it,</i>
2329828 2332786 <i>and I think we really take advantage<br />of it in some of these shots.</i>
2332872 2335910 <i>And certainly this is<br />a big, big effects movie,</i>
2336000 2338742 <i>probably one of the biggest<br />that Disney's ever done.</i>
2338837 2344003 <i>And Dave and his staff really<br />responded to that challenge,</i>
2344092 2346925 <i>and did just sort of magnificent work.</i>
2347011 2350754 <i>I think we were really blown away<br />by the work of the effects department</i>
2350849 2352089 <i>on this film.</i>
2357981 2359972 CLEMENTS: <i>A lot of the reason<br />for the Etherium</i>
2360066 2361585 <i>and being able to breathe<br />in outer space</i>
2361609 2364146 <i>is so you could do something<br />like this on an open-deck ship</i>
2364237 2366649 <i>and it just made it<br />a lot more fun and visceral</i>
2366739 2368467 <i>than if they were in<br />some kind of a spaceship.</i>
2368491 2370928 CLEMENTS: <i>What would a space<br />sea adventure be without a storm?</i>
2370952 2372113 MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>
2376875 2379492 <i>Peter De Mund did<br />some of the effects here</i>
2379586 2383454 <i>with the explosions and all the smoke<br />trailing off this giant meteor.</i>
2383548 2385289 <i>I guess the idea for this,<br />Francis Glebas...</i>
2385383 2387750 CLEMENTS: <i>Francis Glebas came up<br />with the giant star shard</i>
2387844 2390006 <i>that reverses direction</i>
2390096 2393179 <i>and kind of breaks the sequence<br />into part one and part two.</i>
2393266 2397009 <i>Part one being the star shards,<br />part two being the black hole.</i>
2398396 2400478 CONLI: <i>This sequence really was<br />a tent pole for us.</i>
2400565 2402501 <i>We were able to get this<br />into production really early</i>
2402525 2403878 <i>because we knew<br />we wanted this storm.</i>
2403902 2405462 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, it was one of<br />the first sequences begun,</i>
2405486 2408979 <i>although it took a long time<br />because it had all these special effects.</i>
2409073 2412065 CLEMENTS: <i>Very.<br />And it's an effects tour de force</i>
2412160 2416449 <i>with a combination of<br />2-D effects and 3-D effects.</i>
2416706 2418822 No, Captain. They're not erratic at all.
2419667 2421507 CLEMENTS: <i>Those screens are cool.</i><br />MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>
2422378 2424745 ...followed by the biggest<br />magilla of them all!
2424839 2426150 MUSKER: <i>We were told<br />by Nancy Beiman</i>
2426174 2427756 <i>that we misused<br />the word "magilla" here,</i>
2427842 2430675 <i>but we took our lives<br />in our hands and said,</i>
2430762 2432594 <i>"Nancy, we're keeping 'magilla."</i>
2432680 2435217 <i>And she moved to<br />Savannah, Georgia after.</i>
2437352 2440014 Aye, Captain. You heard her, men.
2440188 2442145 Unfurl those sails.
2442398 2444810 CONLI: <i>Nice little piece of acting<br />for Arrow back there.</i>
2444901 2446107 MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>
2446819 2448935 <i>Birdbrain Mary, the little bird on legs,</i>
2449030 2450633 <i>that was John Mahoney's, I think,<br />character design.</i>
2450657 2452398 <i>One of our designers.</i>
2452492 2454053 CLEMENTS: <i>Although<br />not originally a female,</i>
2454077 2455637 <i>I think Ellen Woodbury, the animator...</i>
2455703 2457181 MUSKER: <i>She saw<br />something female there.</i>
2457205 2458766 CLEMENTS: <i>...wanted to have<br />one female pirate.</i>
2458790 2461452 <i>And we agreed it would be nice<br />to at least have one female pirate.</i>
2461542 2463749 MUSKER: <i>To have the allure<br />of that woman there, yes.</i>
2463836 2466419 CLEMENTS: <i>Some people find her<br />attractive, which is really scary.</i>
2466506 2468042 MUSKER: <i>Ron, you do.</i>
2468132 2469793 CLEMENTS: <i>That's pretty scary.</i>
2470385 2471796 (SCREAMING)
2474722 2476212 <i>Now we've started to kill off</i>
2476349 2478465 <i>some of the more complicated<br />characters in the movie.</i>
2478559 2480846 <i>Arrow was very difficult to draw<br />and clean up.</i>
2480937 2482998 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, there are some<br />pirates that die during this movie,</i>
2483022 2485209 <i>and they die in order of<br />how complicated they are, I think.</i>
2485233 2486974 <i>The hardest ones to draw<br />went first,</i>
2487068 2490356 <i>so once the characters actually<br />realized they were hard to draw,</i>
2490446 2492886 <i>they started trying to erase<br />their own lines, but it didn't...</i>
2493574 2495736 Captain, the last wave!
2496035 2497742 Here it comes!
2497912 2499994 Hold on to your lifelines, gents!
2500081 2502413 It's gonna be a bumpy ride!
2504168 2506409 MUSKER: <i>As the ship descends down<br />into the black hole,</i>
2506504 2508791 <i>this scene actually was quicker<br />at one time,</i>
2508881 2510761 <i>and Michael Kelly felt strongly<br />we needed a beat</i>
2510842 2513300 <i>that really said,<br />"They're gone. This is over."</i>
2513386 2516799 <i>And so he expanded that time,<br />and I think that really to its benefit,</i>
2516889 2518846 <i>that you really have this moment<br />of suspension</i>
2518933 2520661 <i>where you're not sure<br />what's going to happen.</i>
2520685 2522642 <i>And he really let that hang there<br />and play out.</i>
2522729 2528190 <i>So all this movement de-crescendoed<br />down into this rest,</i>
2528276 2531314 <i>and then suddenly exploded out<br />and made the next part more powerful.</i>
2531404 2534522 <i>And I think Michael really sort of<br />went to the wall on that,</i>
2534615 2538449 <i>retiming that and really trying<br />to give that its maximum impact.</i>
2539787 2541467 CLEMENTS: <i>And Michael's<br />a brilliant editor,</i>
2541539 2541890 <i>and I think did a great job on this film.</i>
2541914 2543308 <i>And I think did a great job on this film.</i>
2543332 2547121 <i>And the most easy-going guy<br />you could possibly work with.</i>
2547211 2550624 <i>I mean, just unflappable, really.</i>
2550715 2552547 <i>MUSKER: It's that lighthearted<br />Irish thing.</i>
2552717 2555254 Thank you. Thank you very much.
2555511 2557718 Well, I have a lot of help<br />to offer anatomically...
2557805 2560137 Amanamonically... Astronomically.
2560767 2562974 CLEMENTS: <i>That's a great line,<br />a very funny line,</i>
2563061 2566224 <i>written by Rob Edwards,<br />who joined us fairly early</i>
2566314 2568305 <i>in the writing process on this film.</i>
2568399 2572484 <i>He's actually one of the writers<br />from the sitcom</i> Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
2572570 2578486 <i>And he worked on this movie with us,<br />writing the script for quite a bit of time,</i>
2578576 2581193 <i>and did a great job<br />and was a really big help</i>
2581287 2582618 <i>in the writing of the movie.</i>
2584165 2585309 MUSKER: <i>We had to cheat, sort of,</i>
2585333 2587995 <i>that Arrow's hat hung around<br />even though he went away</i>
2588086 2590418 <i>so we'd have a little prop<br />for them to react to here.</i>
2590505 2592712 CONLI: <i>Nice editing<br />by Michael Kelly with the...</i>
2592799 2595319 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, Michael Kelly devised<br />some of this, the pacing of this,</i>
2595343 2599337 <i>and the round robin of looks<br />that come up in terms of Jim's guilt.</i>
2599430 2604266 <i>Michael really had a fine eye for just<br />the pace and the length of these shots,</i>
2604352 2606514 <i>and who you go to when.</i>
2606604 2610893 <i>Right, coming up,<br />he cooked this relationship up here.</i>
2612193 2615777 CLEMENTS: <i>And Emma did a great job<br />on this little...</i>
2615863 2617649 <i>Eulogy for Mr. Arrow.</i>
2617782 2618782 A fine spacer,
2619867 2622950 finer than most of us<br />could ever hope to be.
2623037 2624515 CLEMENTS: <i>It used to be<br />a little longer,</i>
2624539 2628407 <i>and we actually followed her<br />all the way back into her...</i>
2628501 2630562 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, there was a scene<br />where she went into her quarters</i>
2630586 2632689 <i>and was sort of leaning against<br />the wall like she was overcome.</i>
2632713 2634233 CLEMENTS: <i>There was a bit<br />with Doppler offering to help</i>
2634257 2637420 <i>and she just can't talk to him,<br />and goes and closes the door.</i>
2637510 2641549 <i>It was very emotional, but it seemed<br />like it took away from Jim's emotion.</i>
2643391 2646725 MUSKER: <i>Ian Gooding design<br />of that big nebula.</i>
2646811 2648497 CLEMENTS: <i>This is a very key<br />sequence of the movie,</i>
2648521 2650182 <i>story-boarded by Ken Harsha</i>
2650273 2653015 <i>who did a beautiful job<br />on the storyboards of this.</i>
2653109 2656227 <i>And the animation by<br />Glen Keane and John Ripa</i>
2656320 2659062 <i>pretty much reflects a lot<br />of what was in those boards.</i>
2659157 2660739 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, it's almost<br />shot for shot.</i>
2661909 2665903 Why, half the crew would be<br />spinning in that black abyss...
2665997 2669080 Look, don't you get it? I screwed up!
2669167 2670657 CLEMENTS: <i>This was<br />a pivotal sequence,</i>
2670751 2672396 <i>I think, that we always<br />pictured this moment</i>
2672420 2674331 <i>as the bonding moment<br />between the two,</i>
2674422 2677631 <i>and that from this point in the movie,<br />actually that Silver and Jim</i>
2677717 2680709 <i>have become father and son.<br />At least, surrogate father and son.</i>
2680803 2684341 <i>And that that will remain.<br />That sort of can't be taken away.</i>
2684432 2687595 <i>So, this is the moment<br />where that happens</i>
2687685 2691679 <i>and that's going to play off a lot<br />in terms of what happens later.</i>
2691981 2696646 James Hawkins.<br />You got the makings of greatness in ya.
2696736 2700855 KEANE: <i>if there was ever<br />a sequence that I would love to go</i>
2700948 2706239 <i>and keep trying to make it reach<br />its potential, it's this sequence.</i>
2706746 2711957 <i>Because it's so deep,<br />and the emotions that I felt with this</i>
2712043 2717004 <i>were so much tied into my own history<br />and what happened to me as a...</i>
2717423 2721917 <i>When I was 18 years old<br />and my football coach comforted me</i>
2722011 2725345 <i>in the parking lot one night<br />after a football game</i>
2725431 2729891 <i>where I had completely lost<br />the starting position,</i>
2729977 2732969 <i>and I felt unjustly treated.</i>
2733064 2736227 <i>And he came out, and put his hand<br />on my shoulder and said,</i>
2736317 2737899 <i>"Glen, you're gonna do great things,"</i>
2737985 2741023 <i>"I'm gonna be there<br />when you're making that touchdown."</i>
2741113 2744697 <i>And, I mean, he had tears in his eyes,<br />and I had tears in my eyes.</i>
2744784 2747242 <i>And looked a lot like Long John Silver.</i>
2747328 2751663 <i>It was one of those soul inspirations<br />for me in this character.</i>
2751749 2756585 <i>And when you're drawing on<br />an emotion like that, that's so real,</i>
2756671 2758332 <i>you're setting yourself up for a fall.</i>
2758422 2763258 <i>You're never going to be able<br />to capture how you felt.</i>
2763344 2765927 <i>I think we both probably animated<br />every scene in this</i>
2766013 2768425 <i>at least two or three times.</i>
2770476 2774765 Next thing ya know,<br />they'll be saying I've gone soft.
2774855 2776596 CLEMENTS: <i>The softer side of Silver.</i>
2777692 2780980 <i>It was tricky, Silver was a very complex<br />character to deal with</i>
2781070 2783437 <i>'cause he's part bad guy,<br />part good guy,</i>
2783531 2785050 <i>and we were always walking<br />that tightrope as far as...</i>
2785074 2787361 <i>and we were always walking<br />that tightrope as far as...</i>
2787451 2789179 MUSKER: <i>Yeah. If he was too nice,<br />that hurt the story.</i>
2789203 2790973 <i>If he was too dark,<br />that seemed to hurt the story.</i>
2790997 2793489 <i>We really struggled to find<br />a balance between the two.</i>
2794959 2797576 <i>This is a very complicated shot,<br />although it doesn't look like it.</i>
2797670 2801129 <i>It's a 3-D set combined with<br />some 2-D elements.</i>
2801215 2803110 CLEMENTS: <i>This is a lot of<br />Adam animation, right?</i>
2803134 2804795 MUSKER: <i>Yeah,<br />Adam Dykstra doing stuff.</i>
2804885 2807923 <i>And Dean Wellins did Jim here,<br />did some really fine attitudes.</i>
2808014 2810972 CLEMENTS: <i>Some of the first<br />animation that Dean did on the movie.</i>
2811058 2812978 MUSKER: <i>And Mike Show did Morph<br />through all this.</i>
2813060 2815518 <i>Mike Show and Jay Jackson<br />did all of Morph pretty much,</i>
2815604 2817040 <i>I guess there's a scene here<br />that other people did,</i>
2817064 2820227 <i>but Mike really did most of him,<br />which was great.</i>
2820318 2822810 <i>Joey Gordon-Levitt<br />who did a great job on Jim's voice,</i>
2822903 2824548 <i>he had to say,<br />"You little squidge," here,</i>
2824572 2826258 <i>and somehow he didn't like<br />the word "squidge"</i>
2826282 2827989 <i>and we had to talk him into it,<br />but Joey...</i>
2828075 2830112 <i>He loosened up in the course<br />of the acting process.</i>
2830202 2832002 <i>In the initial going,<br />he was kind of reserved.</i>
2832079 2835142 <i>"What is this all about? I've never acted<br />without other actors. "And all this.</i>
2835166 2836518 <i>But he eventually came<br />to embrace this,</i>
2836542 2839660 <i>and just did a wonderful job,<br />and did improv stuff as well.</i>
2839754 2841231 CLEMENTS: <i>With Joey,<br />it was very much like Jim,</i>
2841255 2842575 <i>that he started out very cautious</i>
2842631 2845339 <i>and reserved, and then he sort of<br />opened up more and more</i>
2845426 2847713 <i>in the course of, like,<br />several years of recording.</i>
2847803 2850545 <i>-These things take so long to do.</i><br />-MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>
2853142 2854303 (GRUNTS)
2854518 2857727 GOODING: <i>Now here we see<br />the 3-D virtual set</i>
2857813 2859975 <i>re-lit with a completely different look.</i>
2860358 2862599 <i>With a sort of nice green light.</i>
2862693 2865560 <i>Now, everything has turned green<br />at this point,</i>
2865654 2868521 <i>so you know you're approaching<br />Treasure Planet.</i>
2868616 2871108 CLEMENTS: <i>This whole scene is one<br />of the tent-pole scenes</i>
2871202 2872262 <i>from the novel</i> Treasure Island.
2872286 2874389 <i>Of course, we haven't mentioned<br />Robert Louis Stevenson too much,</i>
2874413 2876199 <i>but he was the whole reason<br />for this going.</i>
2876290 2878531 <i>And there's the famous<br />apple barrel scene in there</i>
2878626 2881539 <i>where Jim Hawkins learns the truth<br />about Long John Silver,</i>
2881629 2883106 <i>and this is sort of our homage to that.</i>
2883130 2886589 <i>And we just felt it was important for Jim<br />to realize how he's been betrayed,</i>
2886675 2888541 <i>and we wanted to hang on<br />to that scene,</i>
2888636 2892220 <i>so this is sort of our adaptation<br />of Stevenson's scene.</i>
2893599 2896557 CONLI: <i>I mean, with the adaptation,<br />we were fairly faithful</i>
2896644 2900603 <i>to several tent poles in the book,<br />to kind of maintain that through-line.</i>
2902483 2903894 CLEMENTS: <i>And you<br />children at home,</i>
2903984 2905295 <i>we'd recommend<br />turning off the tape now</i>
2905319 2908186 <i>and going and reading the book<br />because it is actually a great book,</i>
2908280 2911272 <i>and well-worth reading,<br />and holds up to this day.</i>
2911367 2913127 CONLI: <i>It's worth noting<br />that the three of us</i>
2913160 2914304 <i>read the book when we were kids</i>
2914328 2917366 <i>and we fell in love with it,<br />and that's why the film is what it is.</i>
2918207 2919476 GOODING: <i>Towards the end<br />of this sequence,</i>
2919500 2921707 <i>you'll see that<br />everything's transitioning</i>
2921794 2925037 <i>towards a more golden-orange light.</i>
2926048 2928540 <i>Another difficult sequence to do,</i>
2929260 2931046 <i>as transitions always are.</i>
2932805 2935638 <i>Because we have our mutiny<br />coming up,</i>
2935724 2940434 <i>and that, we had originally keyed<br />the mutiny with orange light,</i>
2940521 2942762 <i>so we needed to somehow<br />transition to that,</i>
2942857 2945144 <i>so you see it gradually happening.</i>
2945234 2949523 <i>And it helps to highlight the characters<br />getting more and more angry, also.</i>
2951824 2954737 MUSKER: <i>We're coming up on<br />the reveal of Treasure Planet,</i>
2954827 2956805 <i>which, again, was one of those<br />slight nightmare shots,</i>
2956829 2958786 <i>but David Krentz did some drawings.</i>
2958873 2961786 <i>David Krentz was in layout, and<br />did these beautiful charcoal drawings</i>
2961876 2963520 <i>that showed how the planet<br />might be displayed.</i>
2963544 2964784 <i>And then Uma Thumrugoti,</i>
2964879 2967190 <i>that was one of the more difficult<br />names to pronounce on the movie,</i>
2967214 2970172 <i>really worked for months in terms of<br />just getting all that cloud animation</i>
2970259 2972546 <i>and the reel of the planet<br />working just right.</i>
2973721 2976008 CLEMENTS: <i>Originally,<br />we had Silver set down</i>
2976098 2978180 <i>his spyglass in the earlier sequence,</i>
2978893 2981493 <i>but the way it was staged,<br />there really wasn't any way to show it.</i>
2981562 2983665 <i>But, of course, the bigger question is<br />why does Silver</i>
2983689 2986647 <i>need a spyglass anyway<br />since he's got this cyborg eye?</i>
2986734 2988145 MUSKER: <i>We did record this scene</i>
2988235 2989546 <i>with Joey Gordon-Levitt<br />and Brian Murray</i>
2989570 2990981 <i>in the same room at the same time,</i>
2991071 2992716 <i>which we also did<br />in that earlier sequence.</i>
2992740 2995385 CLEMENTS: <i>A lot of the stuff we did<br />with the two of them together...</i>
2995409 2998329 MUSKER: <i>I think Joey felt strongly<br />he could play off another actor better,</i>
2998412 3000119 <i>and felt less like he was in a void.</i>
3000206 3002366 <i>And he was right, it really<br />brought a lot to the scenes</i>
3002416 3005078 <i>to have them both in the same room<br />and playing off each other.</i>
3005169 3006751 CLEMENTS: <i>And they bonded.</i>
3006837 3010671 <i>You had the sort of older actor<br />and the younger actor,</i>
3010758 3012248 <i>and they became good friends.</i>
3012343 3014488 MUSKER: <i>This scene through<br />Silver's eye we had to retake</i>
3014512 3017675 <i>because the first version of this,<br />it was all green and obscure.</i>
3017765 3018909 <i>You couldn't tell what was going on.</i>
3018933 3021244 <i>And we had to sort of rework it.<br />Dave Tidgwell sort of reworked it</i>
3021268 3023100 <i>to make it clear.</i>
3025147 3026958 <i>Now we're getting into<br />pirates as pirates here,</i>
3026982 3029849 <i>so we really wanted our homage to...<br />You know, classic things.</i>
3029944 3033232 <i>So pirates start swinging into camera<br />and storming down,</i>
3033322 3034938 <i>and we have a shot coming up of Silver</i>
3035032 3037194 <i>with the Jolly Roger<br />rising up behind him.</i>
3037284 3039821 <i>Very iconic images<br />we were going for here.</i>
3039912 3042199 <i>Brandishing the weapons,<br />I mean, all these...</i>
3042289 3043289 <i>Racing around the deck.</i>
3043374 3044705 CLEMENTS: <i>You might notice here</i>
3044792 3047329 <i>that Mr. Hands is also<br />very difficult to draw.</i>
3047419 3049439 MUSKER: <i>Here's one of the icons.<br />That pirate flag was designed</i>
3049463 3051107 <i>by Andy Gaskill, our art director.</i>
3051131 3052192 <i>By Andy Gaskill, our art director.</i>
3052216 3053456 I'll see they all hang.
3053842 3054962 Doctor, familiar with these?
3055052 3057510 Oh, I've seen... Well, I've read...
3059056 3060592 Uh, no. No. No, I'm not.
3061308 3063203 MUSKER: <i>The shot of Morph looking<br />at his reflection, I think,</i>
3063227 3065389 <i>was based on a Roy Disney comment,<br />where he needed to,</i>
3065479 3068392 <i>or wanted to get that set up<br />more clearly, why Morph was...</i>
3068482 3070644 <i>That it was a playful thing<br />and not a malicious thing.</i>
3071860 3073396 CLEMENTS: <i>Yeah, the idea of Morph</i>
3073487 3076730 <i>is that he is just<br />all feelings and emotions</i>
3076824 3081034 <i>and no intellect, and really has no idea<br />of anything that's going on.</i>
3083914 3085154 Stop them!
3086083 3089075 RIPA: <i>These are our big<br />submarine-type shots</i>

3091797 3093538 <i>these tight cornerways<br />and things like that.</i>
3093632 3097216 <i>Shawn Keller had handled Jim<br />and most of those running ones,</i>
3097303 3100887 <i>did a nice job matching<br />the atmosphere and everything.</i>
3101724 3103010 (GRUNTS)
3105519 3107760 MUSKER: <i>This is an example<br />of interactive lighting,</i>
3107855 3111439 <i>where there's a light source outside<br />that changes the lighting of the set.</i>
3111525 3113607 CLEMENTS: <i>I think Emma<br />really enjoyed the fact</i>
3113694 3115810 <i>that she could play action-adventure.</i>
3115904 3119363 <i>She's never really done<br />an action-adventure movie before,</i>
3119450 3125287 <i>and she was actually pregnant through<br />most of the Amelia recording.</i>
3125914 3128034 CONLI: <i>She was very happy<br />she didn't have to get buff.</i>
3128125 3130992 CLEMENTS: <i>So, we lost several<br />complicated characters there</i>
3131086 3132542 <i>that were very difficult to draw.</i>
3132630 3136794 CONLI: <i>So it's a lesson to you, kids,<br />don't ever be a complicated character.</i>
3136884 3138545 MUSKER: <i>You notice Silver's eye</i>
3138636 3139863 <i>changing color<br />through these sequences.</i>
3139887 3142879 <i>He sort of had a mood eye.<br />When he was in his normal mode,</i>
3142973 3144451 <i>and kind of full of blarney, it's yellow.</i>
3144475 3148594 <i>But as he gets angrier, or more<br />incensed or whatever, it gets redder.</i>
3148687 3151520 <i>So you'll see through<br />some of this section, it's a red eye,</i>
3151607 3154474 <i>and as he softens,<br />it goes back into the yellow mode.</i>

3412618 3415030 MUSKER: <i>Oskar Urretabizkaia was<br />the animator for B.E.N.,</i>
3415120 3420081 <i>and of Basque Spanish descent<br />and very difficult-to-pronounce name,</i>
3420167 3421703 <i>but he did a great job.</i>
3421793 3424876 <i>We were concerned<br />'cause B.E.N. is a 3-D character,</i>
3424963 3426816 <i>but we wanted him to integrate<br />with the 2-D characters,</i>
3426840 3430253 <i>so his animation was meant to be<br />as cartoony as the other characters.</i>
3430344 3433132 <i>And we tried to design him<br />so he had a line around him</i>
3433221 3434324 <i>so he'd fit with the other characters,</i>
3434348 3438592 <i>but Oskar animated him in a way<br />that really kept him loose,</i>
3438685 3440365 <i>and the guys who built the rig<br />and all that</i>
3440395 3443478 <i>made it very squashy and stretchy<br />so that it would integrate</i>
3443565 3445522 <i>with the other characters.</i>
3445609 3447020 <i>That was the goal here, really,</i>
3447110 3449589 <i>not to make him feel like he was<br />from another planet, so to speak.</i>
3449613 3451820 CONLI: <i>Yeah, the whole idea<br />of doing him in 3-D</i>
3451907 3455275 <i>was to be able to get the amount<br />of detail on the character</i>

4070984 4072691 <i>So we had to rework it.</i>
4072777 4074296 CLEMENTS: <i>Yeah.<br />There was also a question of</i>
4074320 4076561 <i>whether Jim should shoot Scroop...</i>
4076656 4077967 MUSKER: <i>And not have<br />the violence questioned.</i>
4077991 4079468 CLEMENTS: <i>Which he did at one point.<br />He did shoot him.</i>
4079492 4081095 MUSKER: <i>There did seem<br />to be something poetic</i>
4081119 4083702 <i>about seeing Scroop<br />sail off into the distance</i>

4096175 4099418 GOODING: <i>The lighting in this<br />sequence was really interesting.</i>
4099512 4105303 <i>The very strong under-light<br />coming up from that air vent.</i>
4106102 4108434 Fine work, Jimbo.
4108521 4111104 GOODING: <i>That was a very, very<br />difficult scene to do</i>
4111190 4113101 <i>where Silver comes<br />out of the darkness.</i>
4113192 4116605 <i>Just the balance of what you see<br />and what you don't see</i>
4116696 4118528 <i>was hard to achieve.</i>
4118615 4122108 <i>And this whole sequence<br />had to be really dark</i>
4122201 4123566 <i>so it would be believable</i>
4123661 4127950 <i>that Jim didn't see all these pirates<br />when he first came in,</i>
4128041 4131124 <i>but not so dark that the audience<br />couldn't see what was going on.</i>

4133880 4135496 Ya hates to lose.
4136257 4138736 MUSKER: <i>I think Glen really wanted<br />to do more of a tour de force scene.</i>
4138760 4142469 <i>This is actually animated by Jin Kim<br />but sort of devised by Glen, I think,</i>
4142555 4146014 <i>where Silver really struggles<br />to make this thing open</i>
4146100 4149468 <i>to build up his frustration with Jim<br />and to give Jim the upper hand here.</i>
4149562 4151269 <i>The fact that he can do it effortlessly</i>
4151356 4154815 <i>where Silver can't possibly<br />do it without Jim's help.</i>
4155568 4158435 CLEMENTS: <i>Once again,<br />we played this at one point</i>
4158529 4161237 <i>that Jim was completely demoralized</i>
4161324 4165534 <i>by giving the map directly to Silver<br />after he thought he'd won.</i>
4165620 4167577 <i>But that scene,<br />Jim seemed too passive</i>
4167664 4171032 <i>so we kind of tried to give him<br />a little more defiance here</i>
4171125 4173162 <i>that he's not giving up,<br />even though he has to.</i>
4173252 4175272 CONLI: <i>We had to keep him alive<br />through the rest of the film.</i>
4175296 4176607 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, he receded too much.</i>

4177965 4179046 MUSKER: <i>Yeah.</i>
4179967 4182279 KEANE: <i>These are some of<br />the most difficult scenes to animate.</i>
4182303 4187093 <i>Chris Hubbard did a lot of<br />these scenes where Silver is in awe.</i>
4187725 4190638 <i>And when you animate<br />a character that's in awe of something,</i>
4190728 4193846 <i>it's the other thing<br />that's really amazing,</i>
4193940 4197649 <i>and they're just responding to it<br />and all you have to do is</i>
4197735 4204402 <i>a slow, gradual opening of the eyes<br />and the mouth and a fascination.</i>

4206536 4208026 <i>It's very subtle.</i>
4208121 4211159 <i>And I think he did<br />an incredible job with it.</i>
4212709 4215918 MUSKER: <i>And Ian Gooding concocted<br />those centipede trees.</i>
4216003 4217603 <i>They only appear really<br />in that one shot,</i>
4217630 4220372 <i>but it was so great, we had to use it.</i>
4220967 4223129 <i>And this sequence was<br />originally much longer</i>
4223219 4225572 <i>and it was based, again, sort of on<br />the book and on the movie where</i>
4225596 4227633 <i>they were going through<br />this dark, spooky place</i>
4227724 4229284 <i>in anticipation of finding the treasure.</i>
4229308 4231675 CLEMENTS: <i>And some complicated<br />characters got killed.</i>
4231769 4233726 MUSKER: <i>We had killed off<br />a few people</i>
4233813 4237101 <i>in traps that Flint had set for people<br />as they were coming and it just...</i>
4237191 4239102 <i>We needed to get to<br />the treasure sooner</i>
4239193 4240753 <i>so we wound up<br />tightening this sequence.</i>
4241946 4244233 GOODING: <i>Of course,<br />we had this pulsing</i>
4244323 4247065 <i>lime green light in the background</i>
4247160 4249276 <i>that just keeps going<br />through the whole sequence,</i>

4253750 4256833 <i>It also changes speed<br />which was difficult to track.</i>

4334831 4336663 CONLI: <i>We used to have<br />more exposition here</i>

4723093 4724299 <i>Silver has a choice here.</i>
4724386 4728129 <i>He can either save this treasure<br />he's been obsessed with his entire life,</i>
4728224 4731091 <i>or he can save Jim. He can't do both.</i>
4731644 4732850 (SIGHS)
4733020 4734956 <i>When we first talked to Glen Keane<br />about working on the movie,</i>
4734980 4737517 <i>we described a scene that<br />demonstrated this idea,</i>
4737608 4739669 <i>and that was something,<br />through the course of the film,</i>
4739693 4741213 <i>no matter what we did,<br />we tried to hang on to,</i>
4741237 4743194 <i>just that this was a pivotal moment.</i>
4743280 4744880 CLEMENTS: <i>There was one point<br />we had here</i>
4744949 4747552 <i>when Silver finally made the decision<br />to let go, he couldn't let go.</i>
4747576 4749658 <i>The arm was sort of clasped<br />on to the treasure</i>
4749745 4751473 <i>-and wouldn't let go.</i><br />-MUSKER: <i>That was Glen's idea. Yeah.</i>
4751497 4753308 CLEMENTS: <i>So he had to<br />actually release his arm.</i>
4753332 4754332 <i>His whole arm.</i>
4754416 4755727 CONLI: <i>Pulled the pin<br />and his arm came off.</i>
4755751 4758834 MUSKER: <i>So we had Silver, through<br />the climax of the film being one-armed</i>
4758921 4760315 <i>and he had lost that mechanical side.</i>
4760339 4761441 CLEMENTS: <i>Which would<br />have been simpler.</i>
4761465 4763581 <i>It just reminded us<br />too much of Richard Kimble.</i>
4763676 4764194 MUSKER: <i>Yeah.<br />There was a</i> Fugitive <i>aspect of it</i>
4764218 4765654 MUSKER: <i>Yeah.<br />There was a</i> Fugitive <i>aspect of it</i>
4765678 4768420 <i>that we weren't sure<br />that was a good thing.</i>
4768681 4770171 Silver, you gave up?
4770266 4773509 Just a lifelong obsession, Jim.<br />I'll get over it.
4773602 4775639 MUSKER: <i>Now we're moving<br />into sort of this</i>
4776272 4779105 <i>action-adventure chock-full<br />of 3-D effects</i>
4779191 4783776 <i>and just very dense<br />and, again, got heavily reworked.</i>
4783862 4785853 <i>We had things in<br />at one point where Jim</i>
4785948 4788531 <i>remained on the ship<br />and piloted them to safety.</i>
4788617 4790199 <i>He became the captain of the ship.</i>
4790286 4792126 CLEMENTS: <i>It was always Jim's<br />sort of sequence.</i>
4792246 4794453 MUSKER: <i>It was.</i><br />CLEMENTS: <i>And his chance to really</i>
4794540 4795951 <i>show what he could do.</i>
4796041 4797827 MUSKER: <i>Right,<br />but what he was demonstrating</i>
4797918 4799678 <i>went through<br />at least 10 different variations</i>
4799712 4801419 <i>before we arrived at this one.</i>
4801505 4803792 CLEMENTS: <i>Which ended up bringing<br />the solar surfer back</i>
4803882 4806544 <i>which seems fitting.</i>
4806635 4808395 MUSKER: <i>Yeah,<br />we sort of concocted this thing</i>
4808429 4810170 <i>so Jim would actually be surfing</i>
4810264 4811880 <i>and we had to sort of make it plausible.</i>
4811974 4814716 <i>And I think John Ripa felt, "it should<br />have some form of propulsion."</i>
4814810 4817677 <i>And at one point he was just<br />riding a piece of sheet metal</i>
4817771 4818811 <i>down to what was going on.</i>
4818897 4820792 <i>-Just kind of riding the waves.</i><br />-CLEMENTS: <i>With a solar sail.</i>
4820816 4822932 MUSKER: <i>With a sail,<br />but that seemed too contrived</i>
4823027 4826816 <i>and the idea came up, use the cannon<br />as a form of propulsion for this thing.</i>
4826905 4828646 <i>And I think we reworked it to...</i>
4828741 4830152 <i>And then I think Glen had the idea,</i>
4830242 4832483 <i>it can have a certain amount of<br />canisters of energy</i>
4832578 4835070 <i>so there's sort of<br />a ticking clock that way.</i>
4838083 4840324 CLEMENTS: <i>I don't know<br />if everyone gets it</i>
4840419 4844162 <i>but basically this cannon<br />has these three canisters</i>
4844256 4848716 <i>and Jim uses them all up<br />in his course to try to save the day.</i>
4848802 4852261 CONLI: <i>Yeah, the propulsion device is<br />basically like a chamber for a pistol.</i>
4854266 4857179 <i>The little canisters go in<br />and shoot off the power.</i>
4857269 4860102 CLEMENTS: <i>It's where you get into<br />what has been referred to at Disney</i>
4860189 4862726 <i>as the "plausible impossible."</i>
4865694 4866900 There you go.
4867613 4868728 There you go.
4870282 4872023 Okay. Now, no matter what happens...
4872117 4873261 MUSKER: <i>They used<br />to have a little more</i>
4873285 4874637 <i>dialogue between them as they left</i>
4874661 4876948 <i>"where they sort of said goodbye<br />or, "if I never come back</i>
4877039 4879184 <i>"tell my mother I love her."<br />I mean, practically like that.</i>
4879208 4880869 <i>And it seemed too much at this moment</i>
4880959 4883291 <i>so we went with<br />the more understated...</i>
4883379 4884899 CLEMENTS:<br /><i>There was the first canister.</i>
4884963 4885998 <i>So there's only two left.</i>
4886799 4890008 Get this blasted heap turned 'round!
4891428 4893840 GOODING: <i>This shot you actually<br />see the ship tacking</i>
4893931 4895547 <i>as a real sailing ship might,</i>
4895641 4899430 <i>where the sails transfer<br />from one side of the ship to the other.</i>
4899520 4903434 <i>That was animated by Ian Coony.<br />A nice little touch that he added.</i>
4903524 4906733 RIPA: <i>These scenes coming up<br />with Jim on the surfer,</i>
4906819 4910232 <i>again, went to Jin Kim,<br />just because of how well</i>
4910322 4911904 <i>he was able to do these scenes,</i>
4911990 4913901 <i>and how much he was<br />able to put into them.</i>
4913992 4916029 <i>I mean, they're so difficult as it is</i>
4916120 4919329 <i>that you can get lost in<br />trying to figure out how to do them.</i>
4919415 4922328 <i>That he was able to do them<br />and focus on the performance,</i>
4922418 4924018 <i>which is one of the hardest things to do</i>
4924086 4925855 <i>when you have something<br />that's very technical.</i>
4925879 4928792 <i>And he just was<br />the right person for that.</i>
4928882 4932045 <i>There were also scenes... Bobby Rubio<br />had done a couple of scenes in there.</i>
4932136 4933297 <i>Really nice match.</i>
4933387 4935503 <i>And John Pomeroy has some<br />scenes coming up</i>
4935597 4940262 <i>that really, I think, match the intensity<br />that Jin was able to get into his work.</i>
4940352 4942580 MUSKER: <i>And this was our attempt<br />to get the slight James Bond thing.</i>
4942604 4943832 <i>This came up fairly late<br />in the thing, too.</i>
4943856 4947099 <i>We wanted to give Jim a way<br />of sort of cleverly coming up with</i>
4947192 4950401 <i>some way of saving the day<br />and restarting his engine,</i>
4950487 4953275 <i>so we came up with this thing<br />of him grinding the dead engine</i>
4953365 4956448 <i>against this metal wall<br />and the sparks reigniting it</i>
4956535 4958096 <i>and that was our attempt<br />to do a little reversal</i>
4958120 4961704 <i>at the end of this thing<br />as we head toward the finish line.</i>
4961915 4964122 DOPPLER: Three, two...
4965544 4967021 CLEMENTS: <i>And if anyone<br />was keeping track</i>
4967045 4968189 <i>as far as B.E.N.'s countdown,</i>
4968213 4970705 <i>if that was all accurate, it's not.</i>
4973051 4975613 MUSKER: <i>This was one of the most<br />complicated shots we did in this ending.</i>
4975637 4978032 <i>This turnaround of the ship.<br />Trying to make the sky work behind it</i>
4978056 4980297 <i>because it was 2-D, it was 3-D.</i>
4980392 4982804 <i>I don't even know what it is now,<br />but it was complicated.</i>
4984730 4986061 (CHEERING)
4989067 4991650 <i>Amelia and Doppler used to<br />have a longer thing between them</i>
4991737 4994457 <i>where she sort of talked to him<br />about becoming first mate on the ship</i>
4994490 4995675 <i>and it was a great scene<br />between them.</i>
4995699 4998737 <i>But it seemed like it may have pulled<br />away from Jim a little bit too much</i>
4998827 5000693 <i>so we simplified that.</i>
5000996 5003738 AMELIA: I'd be proud to recommend you<br />to the interstellar academy.
5003832 5005618 CLEMENTS: <i>The proud father.</i>
5006418 5008785 Just wait until your mother<br />hears about this!
5009421 5011191 Of course, we may downplay<br />the life-threatening parts.
5011215 5013172 MUSKER: <i>Again with Martin's<br />goodbye here,</i>
5013258 5015169 <i>or his congratulatory thing here,</i>
5015260 5016779 <i>we had longer versions,<br />we had shorter versions,</i>
5016803 5019282 <i>I think we were much shorter,<br />but we wound up reinstating stuff</i>
5019306 5022674 <i>'cause Martin just did some funny stuff<br />with this crying bit at the end.</i>
5022768 5025635 <i>It just seemed kind of<br />comic that we liked.</i>
5025729 5028687 CLEMENTS: <i>And if people notice,<br />his eyes are now blue.</i>
5028774 5033689 <i>When he got his memory chip,<br />it turned his eyes from green to blue.</i>

5037407 5040195 <i>And Jim's eye mask is gone for good.</i>
5040285 5042117 <i>It's gone for good.</i>
5042621 5044487 JIM: You never quit, do you?
5045207 5048199 MUSKER: <i>And for us, this scene,<br />in this interior,</i>
5048293 5050705 <i>despite all the changes in the story,</i>
5050796 5053834 <i>most of this stayed relatively<br />as it was just in that</i>
5053924 5058509 <i>we wanted to get this sort of<br />moment where Jim lets Silver go,</i>
5058595 5062259 <i>and also, though, that Silver<br />beckons Jim to come with him</i>
5062349 5064215 <i>and Jim having found his newfound<br />maturity,</i>
5064309 5068177 <i>he really says, "No, I think<br />I got a future back home."</i>
5068814 5072899 <i>And it's, again, sort of a tent-pole<br />for us in the movie anyway.</i>
5076071 5080281 KEANE: <i>There's an emotional chord<br />that you know you have to hit</i>
5080367 5081698 <i>in these scenes.</i>
5081785 5085153 <i>And Morph plays such<br />an important moment in this,</i>
5085831 5089415 <i>because Morph has always<br />represented that inseparable</i>
5089501 5091458 <i>element to Silver.</i>
5093547 5095834 <i>And when he's given this choice</i>
5098218 5103088 <i>of hanging on to Morph<br />or giving Morph to Jim,</i>
5103181 5106799 <i>it's such a real gift.</i>
5106893 5110181 RIPA: <i>Yeah, it's really heartfelt<br />because by this time,</i>
5110272 5113390 <i>you know how much<br />Morph means to Silver.</i>
5113525 5116017 I would've taken you up<br />on that offer in a second,
5117279 5120567 but I met this old cyborg...
5121992 5124450 MUSKER: <i>And this shot was added<br />late in the game of Silver</i>
5124536 5126903 <i>because we felt that<br />we were on Jim so long</i>
5126997 5128766 <i>and it's really the relationship<br />between the two of them,</i>
5128790 5130310 <i>so we cut away from Jim<br />during part of it</i>
5130334 5131519 <i>to feature Silver just as he said,</i>
5131543 5132895 <i>"I met this guy<br />who kind of changed my life."</i>
5132919 5136332 <i>It just seemed more emotional<br />to be on Silver for that line.</i>
5136423 5138460 <i>And this line, where he says,</i>
5138550 5141668 <i>"I have a future,"<br />he used to say, "Greatness,"</i>
5141762 5144282 <i>alluding back to where he said,<br />"You have the makings of greatness,"</i>
5144306 5146297 <i>but it seemed a little bit comic</i>
5146391 5148202 <i>and it was a question,<br />"Does it seem too swell-headed?"</i>
5148226 5149704 <i>-And the future...</i><br />-CONLI: <i>Perhaps glib.</i>
5149728 5152561 MUSKER: <i>Glib, and "future" tied into<br />his earlier line where he says,</i>
5152648 5155140 <i>"Yeah, what future?" and it just<br />seemed to round out the thing.</i>
5155233 5158351 CLEMENTS: <i>Beautiful music here by<br />James Newton Howard.</i>
5158445 5161233 MUSKER: <i>Yeah, the theme between<br />Jim and Silver that he stated earlier</i>
5161323 5162550 <i>really sort of comes back around here</i>
5162574 5166863 <i>and he added these violin overdubs,<br />the just really sweet, tender thing.</i>
5166953 5169035 <i>Again, this was Barry Johnson's idea<br />to sort of have</i>
5169122 5171329 <i>Morph dissolve into<br />a puddle of tears here.</i>
5171416 5173407 <i>But it was Tom Schumacher<br />who encouraged us,</i>
5173502 5177120 <i>toward the end of the film, to say,<br />"I think Jim should...</i>"
5177214 5180752 <i>"Or Silver should actually<br />give Morph to Jim as a gift."</i>
5180842 5181882 <i>And that was controversial</i>
5181927 5183863 <i>'cause it was a question,<br />can you give a pet away?</i>
5183887 5185031 CLEMENTS: <i>The pet owners in the...</i>
5185055 5186658 CONLI: <i>Me, being a dog person,<br />I seriously questioned it</i>
5186682 5188701 <i>because I couldn't imagine<br />giving my dog to somebody.</i>
5188725 5189869 MUSKER: <i>Right,<br />but me not being a dog person,</i>
5189893 5191204 <i>I just thought it would<br />really be emotional</i>
5191228 5192455 <i>that the thing Silver cared about most,</i>
5192479 5194641 <i>he actually found it<br />in the grace of his heart</i>
5194731 5197598 <i>to bestow it and it became<br />more powerful on Silver's part.</i>
5197693 5199253 <i>And I think Glen,<br />even though he is a dog owner,</i>
5199277 5202235 <i>said, "Hey, I can see that."<br />So we reworked this ending.</i>
5202322 5204233 CLEMENTS: <i>What made it work<br />was Silver realizing</i>
5204324 5207191 <i>that Morph would actually<br />be happier with Jim.</i>
5207285 5208775 <i>So then he gives him the order.</i>

5377205 5381699 <i>I feel like our films here<br />should have something to say.</i>
5381793 5385787 <i>And this is a story<br />that was borrowed from</i>
5385881 5389044 <i>Robert Louis Stevenson<br />hundreds of years ago,</i>
5389134 5394470 <i>and adapted to our time<br />through Ron and John's vision.</i>
5394556 5399892 <i>And it's just really satisfying<br />to see it actually up on the screen,</i>
5399978 5403596 <i>and for this generation<br />with a new message to it,</i>

5441186 5443553 <i>Whereas you guys have been really<br />looking at this thing...</i>
5443647 5445729 <i>I mean, Ron,<br />you should talk about this.</i>
5445815 5450901 <i>The fact that you pitched this in 1985<br />is a phenomenal...</i>
5450987 5452465 MUSKER: <i>Same meeting<br />with</i> Little Mermaid.
5452489 5455151 CLEMENTS: <i>Yes,<br />I originally pitched this at</i>
5455241 5456777 <i>what they called a gong show,</i>
5456868 5460782 <i>which was sort of a meeting, actually,<br />with Michael Eisner</i>

5472092 5475255 <i>and this has been<br />on the back burner for a long time</i>
5475387 5476673 <i>so it's nice to finally see it.</i>
5476763 5480222 CONLI: <i>A great lesson in<br />persistence on this one.</i>
5480350 5482091 <i>But it's truly, for me,</i>
5482185 5485473 <i>it is a piece of literature that I loved<br />ever since I was a kid.</i>
5485563 5487520 <i>It was kind of the book<br />that got me into reading</i>

5511172 5513334 <i>so it's been to the movie's<br />good fortune, I would say,</i>
5513425 5515416 <i>that it's taken this long<br />to get off the ground.</i>
5515510 5518230 CONLI: <i>Had we started five years<br />earlier, we couldn't have got there.</i>

5525770 5529263 <i>I mean, John and I have been working<br />on this for a long period of time.</i>
5529357 5531724 <i>Even between</i><br />Little Mermaid <i>and</i> Aladdin,

5532944 5536062 <i>Between</i> Aladdin <i>and</i> Hercules<br /><i>we worked on it a little bit.</i>
5536156 5539740 <i>And even then, we conceived it<br />as a big action-adventure movie</i>

5543913 5545403 <i>cinematics into it,</i>
5545498 5549457 <i>and had no idea<br />how that would be possible,</i>
5549544 5554038 <i>and it turned out that by the time<br />we were actually able to do the film,</i>
5554132 5557375 <i>technology had developed<br />that actually made it possible,</i>
5557469 5560632 <i>but even then, a lot of stuff was<br />developed in the course of the movie</i>

5592420 5596880 CLEMENTS: <i>We decided to go for this<br />kind of classical look to the movie</i>
5596966 5601335 <i>and a very sort of dimensional,<br />classical look to the characters,</i>
5602180 5605218 <i>which really put a big emphasis,<br />not only on</i>
5605308 5610098 <i>that you needed superb acting,<br />but draftsmanship was so important.</i>
5610188 5613556 <i>And we had just such amazing<br />animators on this film</i>

5620573 5625784 <i>and the quality of draftsmanship,<br />I think, is a little bit unprecedented.</i>
5625870 5628453 CONLI: <i>I think a nod also goes<br />to the performers themselves.</i>
5628540 5630622 <i>Because I think,<br />from an acting standpoint,</i>

5638883 5640999 CLEMENTS: <i>By the way,</i><br />Treasure Planet <i>was a</i>
5641094 5643756 <i>controversial title for this movie.</i>
