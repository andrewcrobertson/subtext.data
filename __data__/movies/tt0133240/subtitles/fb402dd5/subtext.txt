1098140 1101303 -Hello! Can you hear me?<br />-Yes, I can! Stop that banging!
1101394 1103886 If I may, Doctor,<br />this works so much better
1103980 1107062 -when it's right-way up and plugged in.<br />-Ooh!
1107148 1108229 Lovely. There you go.
1108316 1111024 If you don't mind,<br />I can manage my own plugging!
1111111 1112192 I'm Captain Amelia,
1112279 1113821 late of a few run-ins<br />with the Protean Armada.
1113905 1116405 Nasty business, but I won't<br />bore you with my scars.
1116491 1118326 You've met my first officer, Mr. Arrow.
1118410 1120536 Sterling, tough, dependable,<br />honest, brave, and true.
1120620 1121826 Please, Captain.
1121913 1123830 Shut up, Arrow. You know<br />I don't mean a word of it.
1123914 1127452 Ahem. Excuse me. I hate to<br />interrupt this lovely banter,
1127543 1129830 but may I introduce to you Jim Hawkins?
1129920 1133038 Jim, you see, is the boy<br />who found the treasure…
1133132 1134622 Doctor, please!
1135467 1136707 [GROWLS]
1138137 1140253 I'd like a word with you in my stateroom.
1142140 1146976 Doctor, to muse and blabber<br />about a treasure map
1147353 1149594 in front of this particular crew
1149689 1151771 demonstrates a level of ineptitude
1151858 1153849 that borders on the imbecilic,
1153943 1155736 and I mean that in a very caring way.
1155820 1158902 "Imbecilic," did you say?<br />Foolishness, I've…
1158989 1160650 May I see the map, please?
1167205 1168195 Here.
1169458 1170448 Hmm.
1170542 1171828 Fascinating.
1173420 1175252 Mr. Hawkins, in the future,
1175339 1177297 you will address me<br />as "Captain" or "ma'am."
1177381 1178371 Is that clear?
1178841 1180377 Ugh…
1181177 1182258 Mr. Hawkins?
1183512 1185628 -Yes, ma'am.<br />-That'll do.
1186557 1188225 Gentlemen, this must be kept<br />under lock and key
1188309 1191722 when not in use. And, Doctor, again,
1191812 1193597 with the greatest possible respect,
1193688 1195645 zip your howling screamer.
1195732 1196899 Captain, I assure you I…
1196983 1200567 Let me make this<br />as monosyllabic as possible.
1200654 1205194 I don't much care<br />for this crew you hired.
1205283 1207243 They're… How did I describe them, Arrow?
1207327 1209829 I said something rather good<br />this morning before coffee.
1209913 1214031 "A ludicrous parcel<br />of driveling galoots," ma'am.
1214124 1217583 -There you go. Poetry.<br />-Now, see here…
1217670 1221755 Doctor, I'd love to chat,<br />tea, cake, the whole shebang,
1221840 1223008 but I have a ship to launch,
1223092 1225083 and you've got your outfit to buff up.
1225511 1227798 Mr. Arrow, please escort<br />these two neophytes
1227888 1229138 down to the galley straightaway.
1229222 1231891 Young Hawkins will be working<br />for our cook, Mr. Silver.
1231975 1233886 What? The cook?
1235687 1238224 That woman! That feline!
1238314 1240149 Who does she think is working for whom?
1240233 1242276 It's my map,<br />and she's got me bussin' tables?
1242360 1246103 I'll not tolerate a cross word<br />about our captain!
1246197 1250155 There's no finer officer<br />in this or any galaxy.
1250450 1252441 [WHISTLING]
1253745 1254985 ARROW: Mr. Silver?
1255080 1257117 Why, Mr. Arrow, sir.
1257749 1260286 Bringin' in such fine<br />and distinguished gents
1260377 1261833 to grace my humble galley.
1261920 1264082 Had I known, I'd have tucked in me shirt.
1264630 1265961 [CHUCKLING]
1269510 1270591 A cyborg!
1270928 1273169 May I introduce Dr. Doppler,
1273264 1275301 the financier of our voyage.
1275808 1278015 Love the outfit, Doc.
1278102 1280969 Well, thank you. Um, love the eye.
1281439 1283770 Uh, this young lad is Jim Hawkins.
1284774 1285935 Jimbo!
1292073 1296362 Now, don't be too put off<br />by this hunk of hardware.
1297203 1298659 [HUMMING]
1302291 1303372 Whoa!
1303959 1306291 These gears have been<br />tough getting used to,
1306378 1309746 but they do come in mighty handy<br />from time to time.
1318306 1319387 Mmm!
1320099 1324468 Here, now, have a taste<br />of me famous bonzabeast stew.
1324979 1326310 [SNIFFING]
1328024 1332018 Mmm! Delightfully tangy, yet robust.
1332111 1334569 SILVER: Old family recipe.
1334655 1335769 Aah!
1335864 1339073 In fact, that was part of the old family!
1339159 1341241 [LAUGHS]
1343622 1345033 I'm just kiddin', Doc!
1345123 1349412 Yeah, well…<br />I'm nothin' if I ain't a kidder.
1349503 1351494 Go on, Jimbo. Have a swig.
1357301 1358507 [GIGGLING]
1358844 1360255 SILVER: Morph!
1360679 1363467 You jiggle-headed blob of mischief!
1363557 1365639 So that's where you was hiding!
1366519 1367600 [CHATTERING]
1367686 1368926 [BELCH]
1372690 1373896 What is that thing?
1373983 1374984 "What is that thing?"
1375068 1376934 SILVER: He's a morph.
1377153 1380020 I rescued the little shape-shifter<br />on Proteus 1.
1380615 1382026 [COOING]
1382117 1384404 Aw, he took a shine to me.
1384494 1386735 We been together ever since.
1386871 1389282 Right? Yeah. Nice boy.
1389623 1391113 We're about to get underway.
1391208 1393293 Would you like to observe<br />the launch, Doctor?
1393377 1394412 Would I?
1394503 1397541 Does an active galactic nucleus<br />have superluminal jets?
1398757 1400247 I'll follow you.
1400342 1404836 Mr. Hawkins will stay here<br />in your charge, Mr. Silver.
1404930 1405964 [COUGHING]
1406055 1407921 Beggin' your pardon, sir, but…
1408224 1412718 Captain's orders! See to it<br />the new cabin boy's kept busy.
1413062 1415724 -But, no, but…<br />-No, you can't…
1416482 1417688 [BOTH SIGH]
1420528 1424316 So, Captain's put you with me, eh?
1424406 1425692 Whatever.
1427951 1431410 Well, who be a humble cyborg<br />to argue with a captain?
1432581 1433696 Yeah.
1434499 1436831 You know, these purps,
1436918 1441037 they're kind of like the ones<br />back home on Montressor.
1441630 1442745 You ever been there?
1443090 1445457 I can't say as I have, Jimbo.
1447553 1449965 Come to think of it, just before I left,
1450055 1451762 I met this old guy who was, um…
1452349 1455512 He was kind of looking<br />for a cyborg buddy of his.
1455603 1456593 Is that so?
1456812 1457927 Yeah.
1458689 1461350 What was that old salamander's name?
1462233 1464224 Oh, yeah. Bones.
1464944 1466400 Billy Bones?
1466487 1469229 Bones? Bones?
1470408 1472240 T'ain't ringin' any bells.
1472327 1474238 Must have been a different cyborg.
1474329 1477696 There's a slew of cyborgs<br />roamin' this port.
1477789 1480747 -[WHISTLE ON DECK]<br />-ARROW: Prepare to cast off!
1481335 1484999 Off with you, lad, and watch the launch.
1485088 1488547 There'll be plenty work<br />a-waitin' for you afterwards.
1488926 1490712 -[HUMMING]<br />-[CHATTERING]
1493847 1498386 We best be keepin' a sharp eye<br />on this one, eh, Morph?
1499685 1503644 We wouldn't want him strayin'<br />into things he shouldn't.
1504607 1506939 We're all clear, Captain!
1507360 1510318 Well, my friend. Are we ready<br />to raise this creaking tub?
1510738 1512523 My pleasure, Captain.
1512864 1515481 All hands to stations!
1516910 1518071 Smartly now!
1518161 1520869 Come on, you scurvy scum! I'll race you!
1523375 1526413 Loose all solar sails!
1530506 1531541 [GRUNTING]
1531632 1532963 Come on!
1538305 1540637 ARROW: Heave up the braces.
1541684 1543049 Brace up.
1557240 1558776 Ooh! Oh!
1558866 1561654 Mr. Zoff, engage artificial gravity.
1561786 1563322 [FARTING]
1565914 1566949 [CLANKING]
1567040 1568747 [CLATTERING]
1569209 1572418 South by southwest,<br />Mr. Turnbuckle, heading 2-1 -0-0.
1572754 1575212 Aye, Captain. 2-1 -0-0.
1577968 1580084 Full speed, Mr. Arrow, if you please.
1580178 1581213 Take her away!
1585516 1587302 Brace yourself, Doctor.
1587393 1588743 [SNIDELY] "Brace yourself."
1589478 1590934 Aah! Oof!
1610707 1611697 Whoa.
1611791 1613202 [CALLING]
1628807 1632801 Upon my word, an Orcus Galacticus.
1634646 1635680 Smile.
1635772 1637479 Doctor, I'd stand clear…
1642612 1645274 'Tis a grand day for sailing, Captain,
1645365 1646480 and look at you.
1646991 1649449 You're as trim and as bonny as a sloop
1649535 1652072 with new sails and a fresh coat of paint.
1652372 1654038 You can keep that kind of flim-flammery
1654122 1655707 for your spaceport floozies, Silver.
1655791 1657333 "Spaceport floozy, spaceport floozy…"
1657417 1659704 You cut me to the quick, Captain.
1660295 1662878 I speaks nothing<br />but me heart at all times.
1662964 1664464 MORPH: "Nothing but me heart."
1664841 1666891 And, by the way,<br />isn't that your cabin boy
1667219 1670507 aimlessly footling about<br />in those shrouds?
1670722 1672132 Yep, it…
1672473 1677388 A momentary aberration, Cap'n,<br />soon to be addressed. Jimbo!
1678646 1682139 I got two new friends<br />I'd like you to meet.
1683484 1687853 Say hello to Mr. Mop and Mrs. Bucket.
1688155 1689895 [LAUGHING]
1690073 1691279 Yippie.
1693368 1695780 Yeah, I got your Mr. Mop.
1699082 1701369 Watch it, twerp.
1703837 1707545 [MURMURING]
1715305 1718013 What are you looking at, weirdo?
1719059 1721016 Yeah, weirdo.
1721645 1723761 [HISSING]
1724814 1731186 Cabin boys should learn<br />to mind their own business.
1731529 1733691 Why? You got something to hide,<br />bright eyes?
1735700 1740035 Maybe your ears don't work so well.
1740121 1741486 [GRUNTS] Yeah. Ahem.
1742122 1744204 Too bad my nose works just fine.
1744291 1747329 Why, you impudent little…
1748253 1750039 [CREW SHOUTING]
1750255 1753748 -Go ahead! Slice him! Dice him!<br />-[FARTING NOISE]
1754176 1757885 Any last words, cabin boy?
1760306 1761671 Mr. Scroop…
1764393 1767306 You ever see what happens to a fresh purp
1767396 1770605 when you squeeze real hard?
1773152 1774642 ARROW: What's all this, then?
1778615 1780151 You know the rules.
1780241 1782608 There'll be no brawling on this ship.
1782744 1783905 Aye-aye, sir.
1783995 1787829 Any further offenders<br />will be confined to the brig
1787916 1790078 for the remainder of the voyage.
1790960 1793827 Am I clear, Mr. Scroop?
1800344 1802335 Transparently.
1807935 1810518 SILVER: Well done, Mr. Arrow, sir!
1810604 1813470 A tight ship's a happy ship, sir.
1814857 1817315 Jimbo, I gave you a job.
1817401 1819688 Hey, I was doing it until that bug thing…
1819779 1825240 Belay that! Now, I want<br />this deck swabbed spotless,
1825326 1828614 and heaven help you<br />if I come back and it's not done.
1829247 1832739 Morph? Keep an eye on this pup,
1832832 1834667 and let me know if there be<br />any more distractions.
1834751 1836287 Okay. Aye-aye.
1837337 1839078 [CHATTERING]
1839172 1840333 [SIGHS]
1842300 1843665 [CREW GRUMBLING]
1845512 1847969 So, we're all here, then.
1848055 1850638 -Excuse me.<br />-Fine.
1852476 1857016 Now, if you pardon<br />my plain speaking, gentlemen,
1857606 1859062 are you all
1859149 1864064 -stark-raving, totally blinking daft?<br />-[CHATTERS]
1864405 1866486 After all me finagling getting us hired
1866573 1868234 as an upstanding crew,
1868324 1871783 you want to blow the whole mutiny<br />before its time?
1872328 1874786 The boy was sniffing about.
1875206 1879666 You just stick to the plan,<br />you bug-brained twit.
1880503 1884166 As for the boy, I'll run him so ragged,
1884256 1886372 he won't have time to think.
1889595 1891427 [MORPH LAUGHS]
1893473 1894588 [COUGHS]
1895475 1896636 [SIGHS]
1897269 1899510 Well, this has been a fun day, huh?
1899896 1903854 Making new friends,<br />like that spider psycho.
1904317 1906058 "Spider psycho, spider psycho."
1906152 1908393 Heh. A little uglier.
1908487 1910023 [LAUGHS MANIACALLY]
1910698 1911859 Pretty close.
1911949 1912939 SILVER: Well,
1913409 1916572 thank heavens for little miracles.
1916662 1917777 Up here for an hour,
1917872 1919862 and the deck's still in one piece.
1920624 1923324 Um… Look, I…
1925045 1926501 What you did…
1928882 1930043 Thanks.
1932218 1933800 Didn't your pop ever teach you
1933887 1936218 to pick your fights a bit more carefully?
1941727 1943968 Your father not the teachin' sort?
1944897 1945932 No.
1946273 1950016 He was more the taking off<br />and never coming back sort.
1950819 1951900 Oh.
1955031 1956237 Sorry, lad.
1956658 1959696 Hey, no big deal. I'm doing just fine.
1960953 1962318 Is that so?
1963915 1967499 Well, since the captain<br />has put you in my charge,
1967585 1969628 like it or not, I'll be<br />pounding a few skills
1969712 1972255 into that thick head of yours<br />to keep you out of trouble.
1972339 1973374 -What?<br />-From now on,
1973465 1975627 I'm not letting you out of me sight.
1975717 1978793 You can't do…<br />You won't so much as eat, sleep,
1978887 1981925 or scratch your bum without my say-so.
1982015 1983099 Don't do me any favors!
1983183 1985766 You can be sure of that, my Iad.
1986436 1988177 You can be sure of that.
1988271 1990102 [LAUGHS]

3391218 3393845 I got to find a place to hide,<br />and there's pirates chasing me.
3393929 3396512 Pirates! Don't get me started on pirates!
3396598 3399761 I don't like them.<br />I remember Captain Flint.
3400227 3402093 This guy had such a temper.
3402438 3404355 Wait, wait, wait. You knew Captain Flint?
3404439 3407352 I think he suffered<br />from mood swings, personally.
3407442 3409183 I'm not a therapist, and anyway,
3409277 3411320 but I… You let me know when I'm rambling.
3411404 3412696 But that means… But wait.
3412780 3414942 But then you gotta know<br />about the treasure?
3415283 3416575 -Treasure?<br />-Yeah, Flint's trove?
3416659 3419026 You know, loot of a thousand worlds.
3419120 3420906 It's, well…
3420996 3424159 It's all a little… Little… Little fuzzy.
3424708 3427575 Wait. I… I remember.
3428462 3429873 I do. I… Treasure!
3429963 3432876 Lots of treasure buried in the centroid…
3433050 3434961 Centroid… Centroid of the mechanism.
3435218 3438381 And there was this big door<br />opening and closing,
3438472 3440553 and opening and closing,
3440639 3441890 and Captain Flint wanted to make sure
3441974 3443308 nobody could ever get to his treasure,
3443392 3445975 so I helped him. [SPLUTTERING]
3447229 3449937 Aah! Data inaccessible! Reboot!
3450024 3451731 JIM: B.E.N.? B.E.N.? B.E.N.!
3451817 3454149 Reboot! Aah! And you are?
3454278 3455737 Wait, wait, wait!<br />What about the treasure?
3455821 3457060 I want to say Larry.
3457155 3459567 The centroid of the mechanism, or…
3459657 3462274 I'm sorry. My memory<br />isn't what it used to be.
3462494 3467204 I've lost my mind.<br />You haven't found it, have you?
3467290 3470749 My missing piece?<br />My primary memory circuit?
3471169 3475253 Look, B.E.N., I really need<br />to find a place to hide, okay?
3475339 3478923 So I'm just gonna be,<br />you know, moving on.
3479676 3483044 Oh, uh… So, well, then,
3483138 3486301 I guess this is goodbye, huh?
3487184 3491143 I'm sorry that I'm so dysfunctional.
3492396 3496640 So, uh, go ahead and… I do understand.
3497026 3499688 I do. Bye-bye.
3501739 3502854 [WHINES]
3503366 3504401 [SIGHS]
3504492 3506118 Look, if you're gonna come along,
3506202 3507619 you're gonna have to stop talking.
3507703 3509909 Huzzah! Ha, ha, ha!
3510038 3511620 Oh, this is fantastic!
3511706 3514573 Me and my best buddy out lookin' for a…
3515418 3516624 [CLEARS THROAT]
3517212 3518623 [WHISPERING] Being quiet.
3518713 3521205 And you have to stop touching me.
3521299 3524883 Touching and talking.<br />That's my two big no-nos.
3524970 3527085 Okay. Now, I think that we should…
3527179 3530763 Say, listen, before we go out<br />on our big search,
3530850 3534889 would you mind if we made a quick<br />pit stop at my place? [CHUCKLES]
3535146 3536682 Kind of urgent.
3536814 3540432 JIM: B.E.N., I think<br />you just solved my problem.
3544904 3546363 B.E.N.: Pardon the mess, people.
3546447 3547573 You'd think in 100 years
3547657 3549116 I would've dusted a little more often,
3549200 3551441 but, you know, when you're batchin' it,
3551536 3554119 you tend to let things go.
3554539 3556246 Aw. Isn't that sweet?
3556666 3559579 I find old-fashioned romance<br />so touching, don't you?
3559919 3561910 How about drinks for the happy couple?
3562629 3564336 Oh, uh, ooh. Uh, no.
3564423 3567878 Thank you, we don't drink,<br />and we're not a couple.
3570012 3571093 Ahem.
3571180 3573217 Look at these markings.
3573307 3576095 They're identical to the ones on the map.
3576185 3578186 I suspect these are<br />the hieroglyphic remnants
3578270 3580056 of an ancient culture.
3580146 3581522 CAPTAIN AMELIA: Mr. Hawkins,
3581606 3584223 stop anyone who tries to approach. Ohh!
3584317 3586354 Yes, yes. Now listen to me,
3586444 3589982 stop giving orders for<br />a few milliseconds and lie still.
3590615 3592276 Very forceful, Doctor.
3592700 3594111 Go on. Say something else.
3595661 3597829 Hey, look! There's<br />some more of your buddies!
3597913 3600701 Hey, fellas! We're over here, fellas!
3600790 3602997 Oh! Uhh! Ooh! Ohh!
3606630 3609622 SILVER: Stop wastin' your fire!
3611051 3613634 Hello, up there!
3616639 3617800 Jimbo?
3618390 3621553 If it's all right with the captain,
3621644 3624181 I'd like a short word with ya.
3624730 3627768 No tricks, just a little palaver.
3628150 3630983 Come to bargain for the map, doubtless.
3631070 3633568 Pestilential… -Ugh!<br />-Captain.
3634197 3638782 That means that he thinks<br />we still have it.
3645124 3649493 Morphy! I wondered where you lit off to.
3650755 3652665 [GROANING]
3654091 3655081 Ooh.
3655592 3658584 Oh, this poor old leg's downright snarky,
3658679 3661379 since that game attack<br />we had in the galley. [CHUCKLES]
3664184 3665174 Ahh.
3667604 3670345 Whatever you heard back there,
3670439 3672350 at least the part concerning you,
3673526 3676188 I didn't mean a word of it.
3676737 3680776 If that bloodthirsty lot<br />had thought I'd gone soft,
3680866 3682823 they'd have gutted us both.
3686122 3689785 Listen to me. If we play our cards right,
3689874 3695085 we can both walk away<br />from this rich as kings.
3695255 3697212 -Yeah?<br />-[CHUCKLES]
3697299 3701918 You get me that map,
3702637 3707051 and an even portion<br />of the treasure is yours.
3712604 3713685 Boy.
3715357 3717348 You are really something.
3718319 3720811 All that talk of greatness,
3720904 3724191 light coming off my sails, what a joke.
3724282 3725818 Now, just see here, Jimbo…
3725908 3727076 I mean, at least you taught me one thing.
3727160 3728491 Stick to it, right?
3729120 3730788 Well, that's just what I'm gonna do.
3730872 3732331 I'm gonna make sure that you never see
3732415 3734747 one drabloon of my treasure!
3735043 3738411 That treasure is owed me, by thunder!
3738504 3742792 Well, try to find it<br />without my map, by thunder!
3743800 3747919 Oh, you still don't know how to<br />pick your fights, do you, boy?
3748764 3750505 Now, mark me.
3751725 3755059 Either I get that map by dawn tomorrow,
3755437 3759270 or so help me,<br />I'll use the ship's cannons
3759607 3762941 to blast ya all to kingdom come!
3764278 3766189 Morph, hop to it.
3768157 3769238 Now!
3771619 3773405 Oh, blast it!
3785090 3786706 Gentlemen,
3787675 3790838 we must stay together and…
3791096 3794466 And… -Ohh.<br />-And what? What?
3794556 3796888 We must stay together and what?
3797309 3802349 Doctor, you have wonderful eyes.
3802689 3804145 She's lost her mind!
3804233 3805483 Well, you gotta help her.
3805609 3808067 Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer,<br />not a doctor.
3808153 3809945 I mean, I am a doctor,<br />but I'm not that kind of doctor.
3810029 3812072 I have a doctorate.<br />It's not the same thing.
3812156 3813407 You can't help people with a doctorate.
3813491 3815983 You just sit there, and you're useless.
3816202 3817658 It's okay, Doc.
3818538 3820074 It's all right.
3820456 3823790 Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows<br />exactly how to get out of this.
3823876 3826413 It's just Jimmy<br />has this knowledge of things.
3827338 3829624 Jim, any thoughts at all?
3831258 3833374 Without the map, we're dead.
3834553 3836840 If we try to leave, we're dead.
3837848 3839349 -If we stay here…<br />-"We're dead!
3839433 3841344 "We're dead! We're dead!"
3845855 3849598 Well, I think that Jimmy<br />could use a little quiet time. Heh.
3850234 3852726 So I'll just slip out the back door.
3853362 3854898 -Back door?<br />-Oh, yeah.
3854989 3857822 I get this delightful breeze through here,
3857908 3859034 which I think is important,
3859118 3860619 because ventilation among friends…
3860703 3863239 JIM: Whoa. What is all this stuff?
3863329 3865122 B.E.N.: You mean the miles and miles<br />of machinery that run
3865206 3867906 through the entire course<br />of the inside of this planet?
3868042 3869077 Not a clue.
3869419 3871629 Hey, Doc! Doc! I think<br />I found a way out of here!
3871713 3874090 No, no. Jim, wait.<br />The captain ordered us to stay…
3874174 3876916 -I'll be back.<br />-Cannonball!
3877469 3878550 Woof.
3879429 3881385 [SNORING]
3887060 3889973 -So, what's the plan?<br />-Shh. B.E.N., quiet.
3893859 3895151 [WHISPERING] Okay, here it is.
3895235 3898148 We sneak back to the <i>Legacy,</i><br />disable the laser cannons,
3898238 3900148 and bring back the map.
3900239 3901448 [MUFFLED] That's a good plan.
3901532 3902825 I like that plan. The only thing is,
3902909 3905401 I'm wondering, how do we get there?
3905912 3907027 On that.
3918256 3919917 -Aah!<br />-B.E.N., shh!
3920008 3922249 Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

4467607 4468597 Aah!
4469401 4472564 -Captain Flint?<br />-In the flesh!
4473405 4476523 Well, sort of, except for skin, organs,
4476616 4479529 or anything that, that…<br />That resembles flesh,
4479619 4481235 that's not there.
4481496 4483907 And yet it's so odd, you know?
4483998 4486365 I remember there was something horrible
4486459 4488666 Flint didn't want anyone else to know,
4488753 4491836 but I just can't remember what it was.
4493132 4496090 Oh, a mind is a terrible thing to lose!
4496302 4498134 [SOBBING]
4498304 4501216 B.E.N., I think I just found your mind.
4501306 4502512 -Hold still.<br />-Aah!
4502599 4505717 Jimmy, your hands are very, very cold.
4507187 4508177 Whoa!
4509272 4510433 Hello.
4510648 4513185 You know, Jimmy, I was just thinking…
4513276 4515233 I was just think…
4515904 4518895 It's all flooding back! All my memories!
4518989 4520740 Right up until Flint<br />pulled my memory circuits,
4520824 4523737 so I could never tell anybody<br />about his booby trap!
4523827 4524817 [CRASHING]
4525204 4527821 -Speaking of which…<br />-Huh?
4529833 4531042 Flint wanted to make sure
4531126 4532419 that nobody could ever<br />steal his treasure,
4532503 4533795 so he rigged this whole planet
4533879 4536996 to blow higher than a Kalepsian kite!
4543596 4545178 [YELLING]
4547934 4549800 Run, Jimmy! Run for your life!
4549894 4551687 You go back and help the captain and Doc!
4551771 4554512 If I'm not there in five<br />minutes, leave without me.
4554689 4557021 I am not leaving my buddy Jimmy.
4558360 4560852 Unless he looks at me like that.
4561238 4562273 Bye, Jim!
4569121 4572112 No! No! Oh, no! Oh, no!
4572248 4573283 No!
4575084 4576495 -Aah!<br />-Aah!
4580673 4582414 [CREW YELLING]
4583134 4586047 Come back here, ya blighters!
4587929 4589044 [RUMBLING]
4601651 4604518 All my life, I dreamed<br />of an adventure like this.
4605113 4606147 [SIGHS]
4606238 4607649 I'm just sorry
4607739 4610982 I couldn't have been more helpful to you.
4611076 4612737 Oh, don't be daft.
4613245 4616112 You've been very helpful. Truly.
4617082 4620325 I feel like such a useless weakling
4622087 4624202 with abnormally thin wrists.
4625131 4626496 Excuse me, brutish pirate.
4626591 4627581 [BELCHES]
4627675 4629416 Yes, you. I have a question.
4629844 4631801 Is it that your body is too massive
4631888 4633344 for your teeny-tiny head,
4633764 4636096 or is it that your head is too teeny-tiny
4636184 4637674 for your big, fat body?
4638853 4641219 I pummel you good!
4641313 4643106 Yes, I'm sure you will,<br />but before you do,
4643190 4646057 I have one more question. Is this yours?
4646318 4647433 Uhh…
4654659 4657242 Yes! Morph, we are so out of here!
4657329 4658534 [CACKLING]
4658621 4660362 Ah, Jimbo!
4660789 4664373 Aren't you the seventh wonder<br />of the universe?
4664460 4666497 Get back!
4671717 4675176 I like you, Iad, but I've come too far
4675262 4677628 to let you stand<br />between me and me treasure.
4682518 4683508 JIM: Aah!
4698242 4700483 Oh, no, you don't!
4707668 4709284 [CHATTERING]
4709503 4710618 What?
4714632 4715838 Jimbo.
4718844 4720630 Reach for me now!
4721389 4722550 Reach!
4723724 4726136 I… I can't!
4735026 4736061 I…
4738822 4739812 [SIGHS]
4740949 4745034 Oh, blast me for a fool!
4745537 4746527 [YELLS]
4754211 4755417 [GROANS]
4768725 4770215 Silver, you gave up?
4770310 4773894 Just a lifelong obsession, Jim.<br />I'll get over it.
4774522 4775978 B.E.N.: <i>Aloha,</i> Jimmy!
4778484 4780277 Hurry, people! We got exactly two minutes
4780361 4782476 and 34 seconds till planet's destruction!
4783488 4784530 You're doing fine, Doctor.
4784614 4786730 Now ease her over gently… Gently!
4788368 4789483 Aah!
4789578 4792320 We were better off on exploding planet!
4795000 4796661 Take us out of here, metal man!
4796835 4798075 Aye, Captain!
4801922 4804622 Captain, you dropped from<br />the heavens in the nick of…
4804759 4807171 Save your claptrap for the judge, Silver!
4807553 4809260 [CHUCKLES]
4817771 4819512 Mizzen sail demobilized, Captain!
4819606 4821306 Thrusters at only 30% of capacity.
4821441 4823398 Thirty percent? That means we're…
4823943 4826343 We'll never clear<br />the planet's explosion in time.
4834537 4836868 -We gotta turn around.<br />-What?
4837122 4839864 There's a portal back there.<br />It can get us out of here!
4840084 4842419 DOPPLER: Pardon me, Jim,<br />but didn't that portal open
4842503 4844210 onto a raging inferno?
4844797 4847585 Yes, but I'm gonna change that.
4848384 4850421 I'm gonna open a different door.
4851929 4853554 Captain, really, I don't see<br />how this is possible…
4853638 4855003 Listen to the boy!
4855139 4857631 One minute, 29 seconds<br />till planet's destruction!
4858059 4860892 -What do you need, Jim?<br />-Just some way to attach this.
4860978 4863436 All right. Stand back. Stand back, now.
4865733 4866939 There you go.
4867652 4868767 There you go.
4870321 4872311 Okay. Now, no matter what happens,
4872447 4874747 keep the ship heading<br />straight for that portal.
4875409 4876945 B.E.N.: Fifty-eight seconds!
4885210 4886746 Well, you heard him!
4886837 4890045 Get this blasted heap turned 'round!
4891424 4893050 Doctor, head us back to the portal.
4893134 4894169 Aye, Captain.
4916865 4918606 Go to the right! The right!
4918700 4921408 I know, I know!<br />Will you just let me drive?
4924496 4926203 Twenty-five seconds!
4931044 4932830 No! No!
4936383 4937748 Come on, Iad.
4939386 4941296 Seventeen seconds!
4957445 4961570 B.E.N.: Seven, six, five, four,
4961948 4964155 three, two…
4972751 4974412 Wow! Yeah!
4976087 4977872 SILVER: You done it, Jimmy!
4978506 4981624 You done it, boy! Ha, ha, ha!
4981926 4984338 Didn't I say the lad<br />had greatness in him?
4984678 4986419 [CHEERING]
4997106 5000349 Unorthodox, but ludicrously effective.
5001027 5002609 I'd be proud to recommend you
5002695 5005608 to the interstellar academy.<br />They could use a man like you.
5006449 5008816 Just wait until your mother<br />hears about this!
5009452 5011704 Of course, we may downplay<br />the life-threatening parts.
5011788 5015405 Jimmy, that was unforgettable!
5015791 5017250 I know you don't like touching,
5017334 5019711 but get ready for a hug,<br />big guy, 'cause I gotta hug ya!
5019795 5020956 [LAUGHING]
5023549 5025506 Hey, you hugged me back.
5025801 5028293 Oh, I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
5028554 5029918 [SOBBING]
5034684 5036721 Does anyone have a tissue?
5038062 5039052 [MORPH SQUEAKING]
5039146 5041979 -Morphy, we gotta make tracks.<br />-I know.
5042650 5044516 JIM: You never quit, do you?
5045027 5046984 Ah, Jimbo! Ha ha!
5047321 5049106 I was merely checking to make sure
5049197 5052440 our last longboat was safe and secure.
5053827 5054817 Mmm.
5056288 5057369 Well,
5058623 5060364 that should hold it.
5061376 5063162 I taught you too well.
5065629 5068997 If you don't mind,<br />we'd just as soon avoid prison.
5069091 5072834 Little Morphy here, he's a free spirit.
5074430 5078094 Being in a cage, it'd break his heart.
5091696 5092686 Oh!
5096242 5099109 What say you ship out with us, Iad?
5099203 5101739 You and me, Hawkins and Silver,
5101830 5105915 full of ourselves and no ties to anyone!
5108754 5111872 You know, when I got on this boat,
5113008 5115841 I would've taken you up<br />on that offer in a second,
5117304 5120591 but, uh, I met this old cyborg,
5121223 5125091 and he taught me that<br />I could chart my own course.
5127355 5128891 That's what I'm gonna do.
5129398 5132891 And what do you see<br />off that bow of yours?
5135987 5137227 A future.
5137322 5138608 [CHUCKLES]
5138698 5139733 Why,
5140241 5143734 look at ya, glowing like a solar fire.
5145580 5147696 You're something special, Jim.
5148124 5151617 You're gonna rattle the stars, you are.
5159259 5160590 [CLEARS THROAT]
5160678 5163716 Got a bit of grease<br />in this cyborg eye of mine.

5168769 5172636 Oh, hey, Morph. I'll see ya around, okay?
5172814 5174304 "See ya around."
5183574 5186532 Morphy, I got a job for ya.
5187245 5191238 I need you to keep an eye<br />on this here pup.
5195377 5197163 Will ya do me that little favor?
5197254 5198870 Aye-aye, Captain.
5206263 5208128 Oh, and one more thing.
5209807 5211798 This is for your dear mother,
5211892 5214008 to rebuild that inn of hers.
5217815 5220307 Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.
5220776 5223108 [LAUGHS] Why, Jimbo, lad,
5223487 5226023 when have I ever done otherwise?
