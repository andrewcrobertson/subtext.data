1408324 1410617 Something wrong with my face?
1411327 1413286 She's a freaking loser.
1413329 1416623 Sometimes she gets me so crazy,<br />I could split her head with a razor.
1416665 1419626 -Don't get mental.<br />-You caught me in a bad mood.
1419668 1422504 -You're always in a bad mood.<br />-Adrian ain't sharp.
1422630 1424506 Adrian is a loser.
1424548 1426966 She's pushing 30 freaking years old.
1427009 1429344 If she don't watch out,<br />she's gonna die alone.
1429470 1432055 -I'm 30 myself.<br />-And you'll die alone.
1432181 1434140 I don't see no crowd around you neither.
1434183 1436476 I'd like to kill the freaking moron<br />who broke the mirror.

1443025 1445401 -You still work for Gazzo?<br />-Yeah, sure.
1445528 1448029 Why don't you talk to him about me?
1448239 1451199 I just don't think Gazzo's hiring right now.
1451826 1453868 You know? Come on.
1458040 1460208 -The girl's drying up.<br />-Who?
1460251 1463878 My sister. If she don't start living,<br />her body's gonna dry up.
1463921 1466339 Tomorrow's Thanksgiving, you know that?
1466382 1469259 -Come over and talk to her.<br />-Sure. Beer.

1471720 1474013 Absolutely. You got it.

1519310 1521561 Stay in school and use your brain.

1531947 1534157 You crazy?<br />This man is champion of the world.

1591006 1593508 You stink up the neighborhood !
1595094 1596928 You know, you can. . .
1597054 1601349 When I was your age, only one girl in<br />the whole neighborhood talked like that.
1601392 1603268 That was it. Just one.
1603435 1606562 What are you doing?<br />It'll make your teeth yellow. Don't do that.
1606689 1607939 I like yellow teeth !
1608023 1610400 -It'll make your breath like garbage.<br />-Maybe I like garbage.
1610526 1612277 Nobody likes garbage.
1612695 1615196 Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth<br />wasn't bad looking,
1615281 1617782 but none of the guys ever took her serious.
1617866 1619701 They never took her out<br />for any serious date.
1619785 1621369 -Why?<br />-'Cause that's the way guys are.
1621412 1623454 They laugh when you talk dirty.<br />They think you're cute.
1623539 1626207 After a while, you get a reputation.<br />You get no respect.
1626292 1628626 You understand? You get no respect.
1628711 1631421 I gotta use a bad word, whore.
1631547 1633423 You understand? Whore.
1633549 1637468 See? You use dirty words,<br />and maybe you end up becoming a whore.
1637886 1639470 Come on, Rocky. I'm 1 2.
1639555 1641931 That don't matter.
1642057 1645101 You don't really have to be one.<br />Just act like one and that's it.
1645227 1648896 Boom ! Bing ! You get a bad rep.<br />You understand?
1649231 1652483 Twenty years from now,<br />people are gonna say,
1652568 1654902 "Do you remember Marie?"<br />"No. Who was she?"
1654987 1657572 "She was the little whore who hung down<br />at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."
1657656 1659949 "Oh, yeah. Now I remember her."
1660075 1663578 You see, they don't remember you.<br />They remember the rep.
1663620 1665163 You understand?
1666165 1669459 You got a boyfriend?<br />No, you ain't got a boyfriend.
1669835 1672587 You know why?<br />Why don't you think you have a boyfriend?
1672671 1675465 'Cause you're hanging out with them<br />coconuts on the corner.
1675591 1677342 You hang around coconuts,<br />you get nowhere.
1677426 1679177 They're lemons. Lemons.
1679261 1682305 You hang out with nice people,<br />you get nice friends. You understand?
1682431 1684849 You hang out with smart people,<br />you get smart friends.
1684933 1687477 You hang out with yo-yo people,<br />you get yo-yo friends.
1687603 1689979 You see, it's simple mathematics.
1690814 1692315 -I hope you ain't. . .<br />-I won't.
1692441 1693483 What was I gonna say?
1693609 1696611 You hope I don't keep acting<br />like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
1696695 1697779 Yeah, something like that.
1697863 1698988 Good night, Rocky.

1735150 1738361 -Are the doctor's reports confirmed?<br />-JERGENS: Definitely.
1738654 1740488 Says here Mac Lee Green has suffered
1740572 1744075 "a severely cracked third metacarpal<br />in his left hand."
1744576 1745910 Damn !
1746078 1750081 We can cancel the fight indefinitely<br />if you're set on fighting Green.
1750165 1752208 Hey, it ain't just Green.
1752501 1754836 What about all the time<br />Apollo has invested?
1754920 1756587 We can find a solution.
1756672 1757755 Solution nothing.
1757840 1760550 Find me another ranked contender<br />in a flash, Jergens.
1760676 1762593 MAN: Don't play games with my client.
1762678 1765263 Apollo's already done a million dollars'<br />worth of publicity,
1765347 1768266 has made contractual obligations<br />with 20 different organizations.
1768350 1770059 He's not going to be embarrassed !
1770185 1772520 I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.
1772604 1774564 Ernie's fighting in France that same week.
1774690 1776774 Then get me Buddy Shaw.<br />He's ranked fifth.
1776859 1779694 Went to California and gained 50 pounds.
1780279 1782196 JERGENS: I called every<br />worthwhile contender.
1782239 1786200 They all say five weeks isn't enough time<br />to get into shape.
1786285 1788786 Shape nothing, man. They're afraid.
1788912 1790913 They know everybody<br />is gonna see this fight.
1791039 1792790 None of them's got<br />a prayer of whipping me.
1792875 1796919 They're making excuses so they don't<br />have to be the chump who gets whipped.
1797045 1799630 All I can say is I'm a good promoter.
1800132 1803301 I've promoted fights<br />in every goddamn country in the world
1803385 1805553 and I've broken my ass over this one.
1805637 1807889 I don't know what else to do!
1813437 1814604 I do.
1816940 1820902 Without a ranked contender,<br />what this fight needs is a novelty.
1821320 1823779 This is the land of opportunity, right?
1823906 1826282 So, Apollo Creed, on January 1 st,
1826408 1829452 gives a local underdog fighter<br />an opportunity.
1830162 1834499 A snow-white underdog, and I'm gonna<br />put his face on this poster with me.
1834583 1836459 And I'll tell you why.
1836585 1838586 Because I'm sentimental.
1838921 1841631 A lot of other people in this country<br />are just as sentimental
1841757 1844509 and there's nothing they'd like better<br />than to see Apollo Creed
1844593 1847762 give a local Philadelphia boy<br />a shot at the greatest title in the world
1847804 1850139 on this country's biggest birthday.
1850265 1852308 Now that's the way I see it
1852643 1854936 and that's the way it's gonna be.
1854978 1856646 Apollo, I like it.
1857147 1858940 It's very American.

2212836 2214295 Aw, Paulie!
2215297 2218299 I want you out of here!<br />Get out of the house!
2218508 2221051 Go out and enjoy your freaking life!
2221177 2222344 (ADRIAN YELLING)
2225307 2226974 You hungry, Rock?
2233648 2237318 Hey, yo, Paulie, maybe we better<br />forget all this, you know?
2237819 2240988 Forget nothing. Go ahead.<br />Tell her something funny.
2241031 2244199 Ain't nothing to talk about.<br />She's in a bad mood. I'm in a bad mood.
2244326 2247036 You can do funny things.<br />You wanna go out with my sister?
2247162 2248662 -Yeah.<br />-Well. . .
2252876 2254501 I don't know what to say.
2254586 2255753 Funny.
2267390 2269516 Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky.
2269893 2271560 Rocky, you know?
2272228 2273437 Listen,
2275732 2280194 I don't know what to say, 'cause I ain't<br />never talked to no door before.
2281363 2284573 What do I say to a door?<br />We better forget this.
2284866 2286075 You're doing fine.
2286201 2288535 I ain't doing fine. I look like an idiot.
2288578 2290579 Keep doing what you're doing. Funny.
2290705 2292873 I know all about these things.
2292958 2294708 I feel like a jerk.
2300715 2303133 Yo, Adrian, it's Rocky again.
2303218 2307805 Listen, I know you ain't too happy<br />at this moment.
2308390 2310057 But could you do me a favor?
2310100 2313102 I ain't got nobody<br />to spend Thanksgiving with.
2313269 2316605 So, how about maybe you and I
2316731 2318482 go out together, get something to eat.
2318566 2321110 Maybe laugh a little bit.<br />Who knows, you know?
2321236 2322945 Would you like to. . .
2324781 2327616 Would you like to, maybe,<br />you and me go out together?
2327742 2330285 What do you think? Would you like to?
2335291 2337501 We're gonna have a good time.
2337919 2340087 We'll have a real good time.
2344592 2346427 Thanks for the bird.
2350015 2352933 I'm gonna turn the TV off.<br />I got a headache.
2365280 2367698 -What's your sister like to do?<br />-Ice-skate.
2367782 2369783 Adrian, come on.<br />You're letting the heat out.
2369868 2372161 Who pays the bills around here?
2377792 2380878 Listen, I don't want no turkey anyway,<br />you know?
2382464 2384465 But it was Thanksgiving.
2385300 2386467 What?
2386509 2388469 -It was Thanksgiving.<br />-Yeah, to you.
2388553 2390846 But to me it's Thursday, right?
2415205 2417873 -It looks kind of quiet.<br />-I think it's closed.
2417999 2421085 No, I think we're just early<br />or something like that.
2422504 2424338 -We're closed.<br />-What?
2424672 2427674 -I said we're closed.<br />-Yeah. Hey, listen.
2427717 2431053 I'm gonna smooth this guy out. Wait here.<br />I'll be right back.
2431262 2433055 -We could go someplace else.<br />-No, it's okay.
2433181 2437101 Are you closed to the general public,<br />or are you just closed to everybody?
2437185 2441355 It's after 6:00. It's Thanksgiving.<br />That's why there's nobody here.
2441689 2443732 Besides, you ain't supposed to be in here.
2443858 2446360 So do me a favor and not stay here.
2446402 2449947 -Could you do me a favor?<br />-Come on. We're not operating.
2450198 2453033 Look. This girl here ain't feeling well.
2453118 2455702 Doctors say she should go out<br />and exercise.
2455745 2457871 Ice-skating's probably the best thing.
2457956 2459206 So what do you want from me?
2459290 2461208 Well, hey, I want you to do me a favor.
2461251 2462876 You can see she ain't feeling too good.
2462919 2465921 If you can let her on the ice<br />for a few minutes, I'd appreciate it.
2466047 2467798 Ten minutes, ten bucks.
2467882 2470050 Ten bucks? How about eight bucks?
2470135 2472261 Come on. It's Thanksgiving.
2472554 2474388 All right. Nine bucks, you got a deal.
2474472 2477224 You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.
2479394 2481103 Give her the blades.
2481896 2483230 Aren't you skating?
2483273 2485232 No, I ain't skated since I was 1 5.
2485316 2487609 That's when I started fighting.
2487902 2490571 Skating's kind of bad for the ankles,<br />you know?
2491573 2494283 You're a pretty good skater, aren't you?
2495076 2497578 Like I was saying<br />before on the way over here,
2497662 2500831 fighting used to be tops with me,<br />but no more.
2500915 2503417 All I wanted to do out of fighting<br />was prove I was no bum,
2503501 2505919 that I had the stuff to make a good pro.
2506004 2509006 -You never got the chance?<br />-I ain't crying about it.
2509090 2511341 I still fight. I do it like a hobby.
2511426 2513594 The trouble is I'm a southpaw.
2513678 2516597 -What's a southpaw?<br />-A southpaw means you're left-handed.
2516681 2519057 A southpaw throws your timing off.
2519142 2521435 It throws other guys' timing off,<br />makes them look awkward.
2521519 2523103 Nobody wants to look awkward.
2523188 2526356 -You know where "southpaw" came from?<br />-MAN: Nine minutes!
2526441 2529484 A long time ago, there was this guy,<br />maybe a couple hundred years ago,
2529569 2533030 he was fighting in the. . .<br />I think it was around Philadelphia.
2533114 2537075 His arm. . . He was left-handed.<br />His arm was facing towards New Jersey.
2537160 2540996 And that's south. So naturally<br />they called him "south paw." You see?
2541080 2544374 Southpaw, South Jersey, South Camden.
2544834 2546668 Southpaw. You know what I mean?
2548171 2550297 Things probably worked out for the best,<br />don't you think?
2550381 2553050 Never got a chance<br />because you're left-handed, huh?
2553134 2555219 That's absolutely true, you know?
2555303 2556553 Watch out.
2557055 2558472 (GROANING)
2558556 2561600 Ah ! Ah ! I just dislocated my finger.
2561935 2563477 Ah ! Look at that.
2564229 2566021 Wait. It ain't your fault. Look.
2566105 2568482 See? I had it. . . It's an old wound.
2568566 2570817 You see that? Look. See?
2570902 2572319 Nothing. It bends like that.
2572403 2575364 I originally done it. . . Push the button.<br />Bong. It works.
2575448 2578325 -It ain't your fault. Look.<br />-MAN: Seven minutes!
2579077 2582079 I originally done it. . .<br />I carry pictures of all my fights.
2582163 2584915 I originally done it<br />in the Baby Crenshaw fight.
2584999 2588043 ROCKY: Baby's about the size of an<br />airplane. I broke both hands on his face.
2588127 2591505 I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,<br />don't you think?
2591589 2592923 Real nice.
2594384 2596760 Come on. You having a good time?
2597470 2599388 You can see I ain't too graceful.
2599472 2603850 I don't move well, but I can really swat.<br />I can really hit hard.
2603935 2607604 But I'm a southpaw,<br />and nobody wants to fight no southpaw.
2611317 2612734 (WHOOPS)
2612819 2615570 You know how I got started in fighting?
2615655 2616780 No.
2617532 2619449 Am I talking too loud?
2619742 2621326 MAN: Three minutes!
2621411 2625956 My father, he's a. . .<br />My old man, he was never too smart.
2626040 2628125 He says to me,<br />"You weren't born with much of a brain,
2628209 2630711 "so you better start using your body."
2630795 2632713 So I become a fighter.
2633381 2635132 You know what I mean?
2635216 2637050 Why you laughing?
2638386 2641305 My mother, she said the opposite thing.
2641389 2643640 What did she say the opposite?
2644267 2646560 She said,<br />"You weren't born with much of a body,
2646644 2648395 "so you better develop your brain."
2648479 2651231 -Did she say that?<br />-Yo, time!
2652525 2655402 -Can I ask you a question?<br />-Absolutely.
2656654 2660073 -Why do you wanna fight?<br />-'Cause I can't sing or dance.
2660158 2661241 Hey, yo.
2661743 2663452 ROCKY: Don't fall !
2664704 2667122 That was terrific. I'm pretty good at this.
2667206 2668457 You like the way I skate?
2668541 2671585 Last fight I had,<br />I had with this guy named Spider Rico.
2671669 2674379 He busted my head up there.<br />You see that scar?
2674464 2677466 I'll tell you,<br />things get pretty rough in the ring.
2686934 2689895 You know,<br />some people are very shy by nature.
2690813 2692189 I suppose.
2693066 2694149 (CLEARS THROAT)
2695109 2697986 I say you're very shy by nature, you know?
2699238 2700614 I suppose.
2703284 2705035 The bum from the dark.
2705119 2706787 Get a job, you bum !
2707622 2710499 Some people think<br />that being shy is a disease,
2710583 2712542 but it don't bother me none.
2712627 2714544 Don't bother me either.
2715880 2718006 So why'd I bother bringing it up?
2718091 2720258 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.
2721511 2723553 I think we make<br />a sharp couple of coconuts.
2723638 2726473 I'm dumb and you're shy.<br />What do you think?
2728726 2732312 I don't understand<br />why anybody would wanna be a fighter.
2732647 2737943 You gotta be a moron to wanna<br />be a fighter, you know what I mean?
2738486 2741988 It's a racket where you're<br />almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
2742073 2745492 -I don't think you're a bum.<br />-I'm at least half a bum.
2745701 2747869 But I'll tell you something.
2748746 2751331 Worst thing about fighting<br />is the morning after.
2751416 2752791 -You know?<br />-Morning after.
2752875 2754751 Yeah, the morning after a fight,
2754836 2757379 you're like a large wound,<br />you know what I mean?
2757463 2759506 Sometimes I got pains all over me.
2759590 2763301 I feel like calling a taxi to take me<br />from the bed into the bathroom.
2763386 2765262 Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt.
2765346 2768223 Your face is busted up.<br />Your hands are swollen.
2768307 2771393 Look at this face. Sixty-four fights.<br />Look at that nose.
2771477 2774229 You see that nose?<br />That nose ain't never been broken.
2774313 2776648 I had guys busting on it.
2776732 2779776 I had guys chewing on it,<br />twisting and punching it.
2779861 2781445 I mean, whack, boom.
2781529 2784030 These guys are hitting my nose<br />all the time.
2784115 2786074 Never broke it. I'm very proud of that.
2786159 2787742 That's rare.
2787827 2790871 -Why do you do it if it hurts?<br />-Why you think?
2792290 2794916 'Cause you can't sing and dance?
2795209 2797711 Yeah, something like that.
2797795 2799921 Hey, you wanna come inside?
2802258 2803508 No, I gotta go.
2803593 2805552 Hey, come on. I got some animals.
2805636 2808054 I got these very rare animals inside.
2808139 2809723 Come on in.
2809807 2811224 No, I gotta go.
2811309 2814144 I gotta go, too, to the bathroom. Come on.
2814729 2815896 Come on.
2815980 2817731 No, I gotta go.
2817815 2821443 Look at this face.<br />Is that a face you could trust or what?
2821736 2825906 Is it? They ought to stick this face<br />on a stamp. What do you think?
2826491 2828074 Come on in.
2833664 2835081 Yo, come on.
2855811 2857020 Click.
2862652 2864444 Yo, Adrian, you hungry?
2864529 2865904 No.
2865988 2867656 I got some things in there.
2867740 2870617 If you like sodas, doughnuts or something.
2870785 2872953 Got a couple cupcakes. Huh?
2873162 2874246 No?
2874580 2877123 I got some chocolate in there. No?
2885800 2887717 Hot in here, you know?
2889804 2891930 I could go for some music.
2897562 2898979 Yo, Adrian.
2899397 2902232 These are the exotic animals<br />I was telling you about.
2902316 2904442 These are my friends, Cuff and Link.
2904527 2907279 -I sold them to you.<br />-I know you sold them to me.
2907363 2909864 Remember you were working<br />at that pet shop?
2909949 2913410 First day you was there, and I came in<br />and bought both these animals?
2913494 2914619 I remember that.
2914704 2918415 I bought this bowl<br />and the animals themselves.
2918499 2921084 Some food,<br />the marbles that go on the bottom there.
2921168 2923128 Remember that mountain?
2923212 2927382 I had to get rid of that mountain.<br />They kept fall over and flipping.
2927633 2929384 (SOFT JAZZ MUSlC PLAYlNG)
2930803 2933638 Why don't you come over here<br />and sit down?
2935850 2938226 It's a nice couch. I don't know.
2940396 2943481 There's big bugs in there.<br />It's safer over here.
2946068 2947819 You wanna sit down?
2954535 2956077 These your parents?
2956162 2958413 Yeah, that's both of them there.
2958497 2961166 -Is this you?<br />-Yeah. I was eight years old.
2961250 2964336 That's the Italian Stallion<br />when he was a baby.
2966505 2969716 Come on over.<br />Make yourself comfortable. Relax.
2975181 2976473 Do you have a phone?
2976557 2978433 No, I had it pulled.
2978517 2980352 'Cause people calling all the time,
2980436 2983146 and who needs the aggravation, right?
2983230 2984731 Interruptions.
2985107 2986858 Who'd you wanna call?
2986942 2989653 I wanna let my brother know where I am.
2990446 2991529 Why?
2993199 2994866 I think he might be worried.
2994950 2998036 I'll call your brother, if that's the problem.
3000498 3002749 Yo, Paulie! Your sister's with me!
3002833 3005460 I'll call you back later! See you !
3012093 3014386 You don't like the room, do you?
3014470 3017389 -It's fine.<br />-It's only temporary.
3018057 3019599 It's not that.
3024522 3027565 What's the problem? You don't like me?
3027650 3029859 You don't like the turtles?<br />What's the problem?
3029944 3032696 -I don't think I belong here.<br />-It's okay.
3035491 3037283 I don't belong here.
3037952 3041246 Well, you know, it's okay,<br />'cause you're my guest.
3042373 3045375 I don't know you well enough.
3045459 3048753 I've never been<br />in a man's apartment alone.
3050589 3053425 Well, they're all the same, you know?
3058597 3061182 I'm not sure I know you well enough.
3062560 3064602 I don't feel comfortable.
3064770 3067647 Yo, Adrian, I ain't so comfortable either.
3070067 3071609 I should go.
3071694 3073987 Don't go, please. Don't go.
3076031 3077323 Don't go.
3080911 3082537 Do me a favor.
3082621 3083830 What?
3083914 3085832 Take off these glasses.
3089503 3091796 You have nice eyes, you know?
3093632 3095425 Do me another favor?
3096427 3098803 Why don't you take off that hat?
3105102 3107312 I always knew you was pretty.
3108856 3111483 -Don't tease me.<br />-I'm not teasing you.
3114862 3116654 I ain't teasing you.
3117740 3120366 I just wanna. . . I wanna kiss you.

3209707 3212584 -1 75.<br />-Hey, Rock. How you doing?
3212668 3214836 Mick was looking for you up there, man.
3214920 3217130 -For me? You're sure?<br />-Yeah, yeah.
3217214 3219340 He's looking for you.<br />Get up there and see him.

3238152 3239986 You got something for me?
3240070 3242906 Yeah, there was some guy<br />from Miles Jergens looking for you.
3242990 3246451 They need sparring partners<br />for Apollo Creed. There's the card.
3246535 3248244 -When was he here?<br />-About an hour ago.
3248329 3251623 They're probably looking<br />for sparring partners for Creed.
3251707 3254125 I said that before, you dumb Dago!
3255669 3258880 I been coming here for six years,<br />and six years you been sticking it to me.
3258964 3261466 -How come?<br />-You don't wanna know!
3261550 3263301 Yeah, I wanna know how come.
3263385 3265428 -You wanna know?<br />-I wanna know now!
3265512 3267555 Okay, I'm gonna tell you !
3267640 3271684 You had the talent to become<br />a good fighter, and instead of that,
3271769 3275897 you became a leg breaker<br />for some cheap, second-rate loan shark!
3276815 3277982 It's a living.
3278067 3279901 It's a waste of life!
3298504 3300296 Yes. May I help you?
3305552 3308096 Oh, you must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.
3308180 3311015 Mr. Jergens's expecting you.<br />Just a moment.
3316188 3318606 Mr. Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.
3319149 3320274 Fine.
3321026 3323528 -Please go in, Mr. Balboa.<br />-Can I have that?
3323612 3326030 -Oh, certainly.<br />-Thanks.
3330828 3332203 Mr. Balboa.
3332955 3334747 How are you? George Jergens.
3334832 3336457 Take a chair, please.
3336542 3337750 Thanks.
3339586 3341004 Mr. Balboa.
3341547 3343423 Call me Rocky.
3343507 3345550 Rocky, you got any representation?
3345634 3347135 You have a manager?
3347219 3348636 No, just me.
3350264 3354058 Rocky, I've got a proposition<br />I'd like to make to you.
3354518 3357687 -About sparring?<br />-Beg your pardon?
3357771 3362233 I know you're looking for<br />sparring partners, and I'm very available.
3362443 3364277 -I'm sure you are.<br />-Absolutely.
3364361 3365862 Sparring with the champ<br />would be an honor,
3365946 3367196 and you know what, Mr. Jergens?
3367281 3369157 -What?<br />-I wouldn't take no cheap shots.
3369241 3371409 I'd really be a good sparring partner.
3371493 3373786 You don't understand me, Rocky.
3374204 3376080 My proposition's this.
3376915 3379333 Would you be interested<br />in fighting Apollo Creed
3379418 3382128 for the world heavyweight championship?
3386717 3387884 No.
3387968 3389510 Listen, Rocky.
3390429 3392430 Apollo's seen you fight.
3393265 3394891 He likes you.
3394975 3396726 He wants to fight you.
3396810 3398603 Well, it's just that, you see,
3398687 3401814 I fight in clubs, you know,<br />and I'm really a ham-and-egger.
3401899 3403775 This guy, he's the best, and
3403859 3407445 it wouldn't be such a good fight,<br />but thank you very much.
3407988 3409405 I appreciate it.
3409490 3413826 Rocky, do you believe that America<br />is the land of opportunity?
3415287 3416454 Yeah.
3417206 3418915 Apollo Creed does,
3419291 3421250 and he's gonna prove it to the whole world
3421335 3424045 by giving an unknown a shot at the title.
3424546 3426547 And that unknown is you.
3427299 3429133 He picked you, Rocky.
3430302 3432595 It's the chance of a lifetime.
3433722 3435640 You can't pass it by.
3436934 3438559 What do you say?
3444441 3445525 All right, fellas. That's enough pictures.
3445609 3447443 We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.
3447528 3450071 Apollo, how do you like<br />the City of Brotherly Love?
3450155 3453574 APOLLO: Well, just being in Philadelphia<br />makes me feel patriotic.
3453659 3456369 Beautiful people in a beautiful city<br />coming up to me on the street,
3456453 3457620 wishing me the best.
3457704 3460456 l love my Philadelphia brothers,<br />and l'm proud to be an American.
3460541 3462083 REPORTER: Apollo? Champ?
3462167 3466003 Why did you agree to fight a man<br />who has virtually no chance of winning?
3466088 3468381 APOLLO: lf history proves one thing,
3468465 3472218 American history proves that<br />everybody's got a chance to win.
3472302 3475429 Didn't you guys ever hear<br />of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?
3475514 3477014 Apollo?
3477099 3479642 lt is a coincidence<br />that you're fighting a white man
3479726 3481686 on the most celebrated day<br />in the country's history?
3481770 3484981 l don't know. ls it a coincidence<br />that he's fighting a black man
3485065 3487400 on the most celebrated day<br />in the country's history?
3487484 3489485 MAN 1 : Right on, Apollo!<br />MAN 2: Tell the truth, brother!
3489570 3492155 REPORTER 1 : Listen, Apollo.<br />How do you feel about your challenger?
3492239 3494991 How do l feel about him? Come here, Rock.
3495450 3496784 My main man.
3496869 3499537 -Rocky, ain't you ltalian?<br />-Yeah, I'm Italian.
3499621 3501330 Now what does that mean?
3501415 3504292 That means, if he can't fight,<br />l'll bet he can cook.
3504376 3505543 (ALL LAUGHlNG)
3506003 3508546 Do me a favor. His lungs, punch out.
3508630 3510047 Paulie.
3510132 3513342 Rocky, how do you expect<br />to fight Apollo Creed?
3513886 3516137 Oh, jeez, you know, Creed's the best.
3516221 3517889 l guess l'll have to do the best l can.
3517973 3520641 Tell me, Rocky, just between us,
3520726 3523769 where did you get<br />the name "ltalian Stallion"?
3523854 3528274 Oh, l invented that about eight years ago<br />when l was eating dinner.
3528358 3533154 Rocky, now your payday will be $1 50,000.
3533280 3534697 Any comment?
3536909 3539827 -You got no comment, Rocky, right?<br />-No.
3539912 3541370 -Thank you, Rocky.<br />-Wait a minute.
3541455 3544373 l just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, okay?
3544458 3546542 Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky.
3547669 3550421 You believe all this?<br />Microphones and all that stuff.
3550505 3551631 You didn't.
3551715 3554050 -Thank you, Rocky.<br />-Who you pushing, man?
3554134 3556469 -Smack you in the mouth!<br />-Thank you, Rocky.
3556553 3558429 Don't it matter he making you out a fool?
3558513 3560097 I'd break his lips.
3560224 3563851 -He's taking cheap shots.<br />-Don't bother me none.
3563936 3568773 Yo, Rocky, I guess you'll be looking<br />for people to help you out.
3568857 3570149 Help what?
3570234 3571442 You know,
3571526 3573444 keep you living the clean life.
3573528 3575780 I do okay, you know.
3575864 3577823 You need someone<br />to help with the exercise
3577908 3581744 and someone standing by with a towel<br />or running errands?
3581828 3584580 Hey, yo, Paulie,<br />who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.
3584665 3587250 So I just think I'm gonna train myself,<br />you know?
3587334 3589502 Without such good people around<br />to help you,
3589586 3592046 you don't have such a good chance.
3592172 3594757 Einstein flunked out of school twice.
3595092 3596300 That so?
3596468 3600346 Yeah. Beethoven was deaf.<br />Helen Keller was blind.
3600931 3603349 I think Rocky's got a good chance.
3603725 3604934 (TV CHATTERlNG)
3609064 3611148 Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?
3611233 3614986 You looking to do a good deed?<br />Keep out of my freaking life!
3615904 3617780 -What'd I do?<br />-Nothing.
3617864 3619448 Did I say something wrong?
3619533 3621284 You didn't say nothing. It's all right.
3621368 3623369 That's right! You didn't say nothing !
3623453 3624996 Nothing at all !
3626999 3628416 I gotta go.
3629584 3631961 PAULIE: Where are the freaking pretzels?
3635007 3636966 I'd like to have a pretzel.
3637050 3639135 Hey, we ain't got any beer?
3640012 3643180 I thought you were supposed to<br />pick up some beer!
3651023 3653649 How'd you like hearing your name<br />on TV tonight?
3655402 3656902 I was shocked.
3656987 3658404 Why'd you do that?
3658488 3660239 You're putting me on, right?
3660324 3661699 Absolutely.
3662492 3665244 -What time should I expect you?<br />-About 7:00.
3665329 3667246 -Okay.<br />-Hey.
3674338 3675588 (TRAIN PASSING)
3684765 3688225 You know how I said<br />that stuff on TV didn't bother me?
3688643 3689769 Yeah.
3692230 3693522 It did.
3704159 3707745 Listen, the reason I brought you here<br />is because
3707829 3710164 I wanna know if you got any money<br />for training expenses.
3710248 3711999 I got a few dollars.
3712084 3714335 A few bucks? Here. Put this in your glove.
3714419 3717463 -What's this?<br />-$500. Don't worry about it.
3718715 3720633 You know, you ain't never had any luck,
3720717 3723219 but I think this time Lady Luck<br />may be in your corner.
3723303 3726222 -What do you think?<br />-Maybe.
3726306 3728224 Thanks for the money, Tony.
3728308 3731394 It's okay. Don't worry about it. I'll see you.

3752374 3753874 I'll see you.
3789119 3790286 ROCKY: Yeah.
3795750 3799253 Hello, kid. I seen your light. Can I come in?
3799337 3801630 -Yeah, sure.<br />-Yeah. Good.
3801715 3803799 Hey, it's a nice place here.
3804634 3807428 Anyway, what I come to tell you is that,
3808805 3812057 that what happened to you is freak luck.
3812142 3814059 -Yeah, freak luck.<br />-Ain't it true?
3814144 3816645 Look at the other guys.<br />They're good fighters, right?
3816730 3819440 They're colorful. They got good records.
3819524 3821817 They fight their guts out for peanuts.
3821902 3825863 But you, you got a shot at the title!
3825947 3828407 Freak luck is a strange thing, you know?
3828492 3830993 -Sure is. Can I sit down?<br />-Yeah, sure.
3832621 3835706 -What the hell are those?<br />-Domestic turtles.
3835790 3838334 The one on the top is Cuff<br />and the other guy's Link.
3838418 3839627 The rest are marbles.
3839711 3842046 Yeah? They make good soup.
3842756 3843964 Anyway.
3844049 3846926 Look, I'm here to warn you.
3847010 3851514 You gotta be very careful<br />about this shot that you got at the title.
3851598 3854391 Because, like the Bible says,
3854476 3856644 you ain't gonna get a second chance.
3856728 3858854 Yeah. All right.
3858939 3860856 You thought of that, huh?
3860941 3864360 Well, what you need is a manager.
3865278 3867363 A manager. Listen to me.
3867447 3871200 I know, because I been in this racket<br />for 50 years.
3871284 3874537 -50 years, huh?<br />-50 years. I've seen it all.
3874621 3877957 -All of it. You know what I done?<br />-What?
3878041 3880042 I have done it all.
3880126 3883879 You should've seen me when<br />I knocked that guinea Russo out of the ring.
3883964 3885881 Out of the goddamn ring, I tell you.
3885966 3888008 September 1 4, 1 923,
3888093 3892429 and it was the same night<br />that Firpo knocks Dempsey out of the ring.
3892514 3894890 So who gets the publicity? Figure that out.
3894975 3896892 -Dempsey.<br />-That's right. But why?
3896977 3900813 -'Cause he was champ.<br />-No! Because he had a manager.
3900981 3902523 I had nothing.
3903900 3906402 I wanna show you something.<br />I want you to look at my face.
3906486 3909780 Look at this.<br />I got 21 stitches over this left eye.
3909864 3912324 I got 34 stitches over this eye.
3912409 3915828 You know I had my nose busted 1 7 times.
3915912 3920499 The last time<br />was in that fight with Sailor Mike.
3920584 3923502 I got that clipping here.<br />It was a good fight.
3923587 3925504 Wanna read that?
3925589 3927715 Well, it doesn't matter.
3927799 3931260 Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear.
3932429 3935389 (EXCLAIMING) "Rocky Marciano."
3936766 3940686 You kind of remind me of the Rock,<br />you know that?
3940770 3942813 -You really think so?<br />-That's right.
3942897 3946275 You move like him,<br />and you got heart like he did.
3946359 3949945 Yeah, I got heart,<br />but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?
3953783 3955534 Anyway.
3955619 3958704 You know, when I begun<br />in this business, kid. . .
3960957 3964960 I wanna make a suggestion.<br />Don't drink that piss before a fight.
3965045 3967171 It's no good for you.
3967839 3969632 If you don't mind my saying.
3969716 3971967 Anyway, you know,<br />when I started in this racket,
3972052 3974261 pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.
3974346 3976764 For $1 0, you got to<br />tear somebody's throat out.
3976848 3979099 But I never had no management.
3980477 3983479 One time, this son of a bitch that I fought,
3983563 3985481 he put a nail right there.
3985565 3987900 -In his thumb.<br />-In the thumb of the glove.
3987984 3993113 He punched so many holes in my face,<br />I had spit shooting out of my cheeks.
3993657 3995491 Can you imagine that?
3995575 3999119 Anyway, when I tell you what I looked like<br />when I was in my prime.
3999204 4000954 I want you to look at something.
4001039 4003666 Look at that. That's the way I looked
4004584 4006710 before these guys got at me.
4006795 4010547 That's nice. You didn't take very good care<br />of the picture, though.
4010590 4013842 Well, I never had no management.
4013927 4016178 That's the trouble,<br />but now I got all this knowledge.
4016262 4019014 I got it up here.<br />Now I wanna give it to you.
4019099 4021767 I wanna give you this knowledge.<br />I wanna take care of you.
4021851 4025062 I wanna make sure that what happened<br />to me doesn't happen to you.
4025105 4026939 You know what I mean?
4027023 4028857 Mick, the fight's set.
4028942 4031527 Listen to me. I wanna be your manager.
4031611 4033028 You follow that?
4033113 4035280 Fight's set. I don't need no manager.
4035407 4037741 But you can't buy<br />what I'm gonna give you.
4037784 4040202 I got pain and I got experience.
4040286 4042788 I got pain and I got experience too.
4043540 4044957 Listen, kid.
4045125 4046709 Hey, Mick.
4046793 4049378 I needed your help<br />about 1 0 years ago, right?
4049462 4052464 Ten years ago. You never helped me none.<br />You didn't care.
4052549 4054383 If you wanted help. . .
4054968 4059054 I say, if you wanted help,<br />why didn't you just ask me, kid?
4059139 4061724 I asked, but you never heard nothing !
4062642 4063976 Well, I. . .
4067272 4068647 I know I. . .
4068732 4070399 I'm 76 years old.
4070942 4072276 (TOILET FLUSHING)
4075113 4076321 And. . .
4111816 4114276 Took you long enough to get here.
4114986 4117196 Took 1 0 years to come to my house.
4117280 4119281 You don't like my house?
4119991 4121533 My house stink?
4122702 4124703 That's right, it stinks!
4124788 4127122 ROCKY: I didn't ask no favors from you !
4130210 4132044 Talk about your prime.
4132545 4134463 What about my prime, Mick?
4134714 4136673 At least you had a prime!
4137383 4139635 I ain't had no prime. I ain't had nothing.
4139719 4142679 Legs are going, everything is going.<br />Nobody's giving me nothing.
4142722 4144973 Guy comes up, offers me a fight. Big deal.
4145058 4147518 Wanna fight the fight?<br />Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.
4147560 4151188 I'm gonna go fight that big fight<br />and I'm gonna get that!
4151564 4153357 I'm gonna get that!
4154567 4156693 And you wanna be ringside and see?
4156736 4158821 Do you? You wanna help me out?
4158905 4161657 Do you wanna see me<br />get my face kicked in?
4161741 4163742 Legs ain't working, nothing's working.
4163827 4166245 Think I'll go and fight the champ.
4166746 4168539 Yeah, I'll fight him.

5014343 5016928 The reason we're standing<br />in this refrigerated box
5016970 5020181 is that Mr. Balboa<br />has an unusual method of training.
5020265 5023768 In a moment, he'll demonstrate that<br />for the viewing audience at home.
5023811 5027438 But first, Rocky,<br />how did you come to train in an icebox?
5028023 5030858 Well, my friend, the guy over there,
5030943 5033778 he let me in one day,<br />and I hit the beef here and liked it,
5033862 5037281 and since l've become a challenger,<br />the owner don't mind that l come in.
5037324 5041202 ls this a common training method?<br />Do other fighters pound raw meat?
5041286 5043287 No, I think I invented it.
5043330 5046124 -Would you give us a demonstration?<br />-APOLLO: Confirm the reservation
5046166 5049627 for my people at ringside,<br />and fly my barber to Philly.

5058512 5060972 And send the mayor's wife<br />200 roses from me,
5061014 5063808 and make sure we get a picture of it<br />for all the newspapers.
