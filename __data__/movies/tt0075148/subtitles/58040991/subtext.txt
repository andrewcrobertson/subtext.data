1470760 1475072 <i>... no one having gone more than 12</i><br /><i>rounds with him, and that was Jake...</i>
1475200 1479432 - Stick that up your business.<br />- What are you so insulted about?
1479560 1483712 You want me to take a shot?<br />All right, I'll take a shot!
1496720 1499280 - Hey, Rocky, how about a bottom?<br />- No wine, man.
1499400 1503279 Come on! Just a little.<br />You're makin' a lot of money.
1503400 1505675 Marie,<br />does your brother know you're out?
1505800 1509679 - Screw you, yo-yo!<br />- These guys teach you to talk like that?
1509800 1513475 - Stuff it, man!<br />- Don't you say that to me. Come here!
1513600 1515909 Stick up on it!
1516040 1518110 Swivel on it, ya bum!
1518240 1520196 Hey, you know, when I was your age...
1520320 1525440 ...there was one girl in the neighbourhood<br />who talked like that, you know? Just one.
1525560 1528358 What you doin'?<br />That'll make your teeth yellow.
1528480 1531313 - I like yellow teeth.<br />- And your breath like garbage.
1531440 1534273 - Maybe I like garbage.<br />- C'mon, nobody likes garbage.
1534400 1536630 Anyway, this girl wasn't bad-looking...
1536760 1539149 ...but guys never took her serious,<br />you see?
1539280 1541510 - They never took her out for a date.<br />- Why?
1541640 1544677 Guys laugh when you talk dirty.<br />They think you're cute.
1544800 1548110 If you get a reputation,<br />you get no respect, you understand?
1548240 1551676 You get no respect.<br />I gotta use a bad word.
1551800 1554075 Whore. You understand? Whore.
1554200 1558193 You see, if you use dirty words,<br />you maybe end up becomin' a whore.
1558720 1562269 - Come on, Rocky. I'm 12.<br />- Hey, that don't matter you're 12.
1562400 1567315 You don't really have to be one.<br />You just act like one, and that's it - boom!
1567440 1569396 You get a bad rep, you understand?
1569520 1573308 20 years from now, people are<br />gonna say "Do you remember Marie?"
1573440 1577228 "No, who was she?" "The whore that<br />hung down at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."
1577360 1579920 "Oh, yeah. Now I remember her."
1580040 1585512 You see, they don't remember <i>you.</i><br />They remember the rep, you understand?
1585640 1587471 Hey, you got a boyfriend?
1587600 1590558 No, you ain't got a boyfriend.<br />You know why?
1590680 1594434 Why don't you? Because you hang out<br />with them coconuts on the corner.
1594560 1597916 You hang around with coconuts,<br />you get nowhere. They're lemons!
1598040 1600759 Hang out with nice people,<br />you get nice friends.
1600880 1603519 Hang out with smart people,<br />you get smart friends.
1603640 1606438 Hang out with yo-yo people,<br />you get yo-yo friends.
1606560 1609996 It's simple mathematics.<br />I hope you ain't gonna...
1610120 1611678 - I won't.<br />- What was I gonna say?
1611800 1614837 You hope I stop actin'<br />like a whore or I'll turn into one.
1614960 1617110 - Somethin' like that.<br />- Night, Rocky.
1617240 1619470 - Night, Marie. Take care.<br />- Hey, Rocky.
1619600 1621989 - Yo?<br />- Screw you, creepo!
1629600 1633354 Yeah, who are you to give advice, creepo?<br />Who are you?
1651760 1654957 - Are the doctor's reports confirmed?<br />- Definitely.
1655080 1660757 It says that Green has suffered a severely<br />cracked third metacarpal in his left hand.
1662240 1666074 We can cancel the fight indefinitely<br />if you're set on fighting Green.
1666200 1670478 Hey, it ain't just Green! What about<br />all the time Apollo has invested?
1670600 1673398 - I believe we can find a solution.<br />- Solution nothin'.
1673520 1676114 Find me another contender in a flash,<br />Jergens.
1676240 1680677 Don't play games with my client. He's<br />done a million dollars' worth of publicity...
1680800 1683519 ...and has made contractual obligations.
1683640 1687599 - He's not going to be embarrassed!<br />- I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.
1687720 1691633 - Ernie is fighting in France that week.<br />- Buddy Shaw. He's ranked fifth.
1691760 1696788 Went to California and gained 50 pounds.<br />I got hold of every worthwhile contender...
1696920 1700674 ...and they all say five weeks<br />isn't enough time to get into shape.
1700800 1705157 Shape nothin', man! They afraid! They<br />know everybody's gonna see the fight.
1705280 1707874 None of 'em can whip me.<br />They're makin' excuses...
1708000 1711072 ...so they don't get whipped<br />in front of the whole world.
1711200 1714033 All I can say is I'm a good promoter.
1714160 1717391 I've promoted fights<br />in every goddamn country in the world...
1717520 1722275 ...and I've broken my ass over this,<br />but I don't know what the hell else to do.
1727000 1728877 I do.
1730320 1734472 Without a ranked contender,<br />what this fight is gonna need is a novelty.
1734600 1736875 This is the land of opportunity, right?
1737000 1742870 So Apollo Creed on January 1 gives<br />a local underdog fighter an opportunity.
1743000 1747152 A snow-white underdog. And I'm gonna<br />put his face on this poster with me.
1747280 1748872 And I'll tell you why.
1749000 1753676 Because I'm sentimental,<br />like a lot of other people in this country.
1753800 1757998 There's nothing they'd like better than<br />to see Apollo Creed give a local boy...
1758120 1761908 ...a shot at the world title<br />on this country's biggest birthday.
1762040 1764429 Now <i>that's</i> the way I see it.
1764560 1766596 And that's the way it's gonna be.
1766720 1768711 Apollo, I like it!
1768840 1771149 It's very American.
1771280 1774033 No, Jergens. It's very smart.
1775200 1777555 <i>(Jergens laughs)</i>
1797640 1799949 - What is it?<br />- I just wanna check this out.
1800080 1803356 I pick up two yards from Snyder<br />and a grand from Cappoli?
1803480 1807314 No, no. Two yards from Cappoli<br />and a grand from Snyder.
1807440 1810671 - Two yards. Yeah, I got it.<br />- OK, write it down, OK?
1810800 1814270 Who's this girl you're<br />goin' out with tomorrow night?
1814400 1817358 - How d'you know?<br />- Don't you think I hear things?
1817480 1821951 - A lot of canaries flyin' around the docks.<br />- I'm goin' out with Paulie's sister.
1822080 1825709 - I hear she's retarded.<br />- She ain't retarded. She's shy, you know?
1825840 1830356 I'll tell you what to do. Take her to the zoo.<br />I hear retards like the zoo.
1830480 1832835 - This bum gotta say that?<br />- You callin' me a bum?
1832960 1836111 - I'm callin' <i>you</i> a bum!<br />- OK, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood.
1836240 1838595 - It's his prostate.<br />- He's always in a bad mood.
1838720 1841996 Count your blessings, Buddy.<br />You're still healthy.
1842120 1844350 - I don't like your face.<br />- I don't like yours!
1844480 1846277 - Kiss my ass!<br />- Move!
1846400 1851349 Relax! Relax! Relax! My ears! What,<br />are you drivin' me crazy? Both of ya's.
1853040 1857397 Buddy doesn't like ya. Some guys,<br />they just hate for no reason, you got me?
1857520 1859476 - Yeah.<br />- Come here.
1860520 1863512 There's 50 bucks.<br />You and Adrian, you have a nice time.
1863640 1865756 Thanks.
1866200 1870239 - Hey, how'd you know her name?<br />- You don't think I hear things?
1870840 1873718 - <i>(Buddy)</i> Remember what I told you.<br />- What'd you tell me?
1873840 1875990 Take her to the zoo!
1882840 1886594 - Some more coffee, Mr Creed?<br />- No thanks, Shirley.
1886720 1889678 - What do you think about Billy Snow?<br />- Fouls.
1890840 1892796 - How about Big Chuck Smith?<br />- Yeah.
1892920 1896629 No, he's too old and dull.<br />Hey, that Bobby Judge, he's a good boy.
1896760 1901675 - No, I don't feel the heat from that name.<br />- Joe Zack's a good prospect.
1901800 1905076 Exactly what <i>are</i> you lookin' for, Apollo?
1905720 1909599 This is what I'm lookin' for.<br />The Italian Stallion.
1910480 1912835 Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.
1912960 1915190 Look, it's the name, man.
1915320 1917959 The Italian Stallion.
1918080 1922631 The media'll eat it up. Now who<br />discovered America? An Italian, right?
1922760 1926070 What would be better than<br />to get it on with a descendant?
1926200 1929272 He's a southpaw.<br />I don't want you messin' with them.
1929400 1934155 - They do everything backwards.<br />- Southpaw nothin'! I'll drop him in three.
1934280 1938273 "Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion."
1939760 1941671 Sounds like a damn monster movie!
1941960 1945475 What are you doin' with that bat?<br />I used to be deadly at stickball.
1945600 1950754 - You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?<br />- Very excited. Look at my swollen hands.
1950880 1954077 The joints, from carrying meat<br />in and out of freezers.
1954200 1957272 - Plays hell on the joints.<br />- Maybe you oughta see a doctor.
1957400 1959868 I don't need a doctor.<br />I need a different job.
1960000 1963151 - What kind of turkey? Big or small?<br />- Talk to Gazzo about me.
1963280 1966670 Tell him I'm a good man<br />and nothin' bothers me.
1966800 1970349 I'd make a great collector.<br />Bustin' bones don't bother me.
1970480 1975190 A big turkey, right? Hey, forget Gazzo.<br />That's a bad job, you know what I mean?
1975320 1978676 - You got a match?<br />- Go to him for me, as a favour.
1978800 1981519 Yeah, yeah. Last time I had a turkey...
1981640 1987237 ...it was when they had a $2 special<br />at Horn & Hardart's about three years ago.
1995240 2000234 - Your sister knows I'm comin', for sure?<br />- Yeah, she's gonna be excited.
2002400 2005153 Hey, will you forget about Gazzo, huh?
2005280 2008511 - I don't ask nobody twice.<br />- You don't ask nobody twice.
2008640 2011393 # Stay away, baby
2013200 2018797 - You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very excited.
2021320 2023914 <i>(Adrian)</i> Paulie! You're late.
2024040 2028989 You called the hospital? She calls<br />the hospital if I'm ten minutes late.
2029120 2031270 <i>(Rocky)</i> Yo, how you doin'?
2031400 2033755 I told you she's very excited.
2036440 2038715 Why didn't you say<br />you were bringin' him?
2038840 2042276 - Look at me. I'm not ready.<br />- Would it make a difference if you were?
2042400 2046075 - He's a friend and he's takin' you out.<br />- No, I can't.
2046200 2049749 I want you outta the kitchen<br />and I want you out right now.
2049880 2052235 I won't.
2052360 2055033 Hey! Hey!
2055680 2058069 Hey, I want you outta here instamatically!
2058200 2062876 I'm sick of seein' you hangin' around<br />like a spider! Go out and live! Enjoy life!
2063000 2066436 - Paulie, I can't go!<br />- Don't get wise with me now.
2066560 2070269 - I'm tired of you bein' a loser.<br />- Don't call me that, Paulie!
2070400 2073198 <i>(TV) Apollo Creed is</i><br /><i>shopping for another "victim"...</i>
2073320 2077029 <i>... to fill Green's vacancy for the</i><br /><i>Bicentennial championship fight...</i>
2077160 2079674 You didn't tell me<br />you were bringin' him home!
2079800 2082837 I'm not gonna go, Paulie!<br />I can't go! I won't go!
2082960 2084871 Why?
2085000 2088788 Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.<br />I got a turkey in the oven.
2088920 2091753 Oh. A turkey in the oven?
2091880 2093836 Oh.
2105760 2107591 You want the bird?
2107720 2109836 Go in the alley and eat the bird!
2109960 2112190 Oh, Paulie!
2112320 2115118 I want you outta here!<br />Get outta the house!
2115440 2117635 Go out and enjoy your freakin' life!
2121920 2124275 You hungry, Rock?
2129760 2133435 Hey, yo, Paulie. Maybe we'd just<br />better forget all this, you know?
2133560 2136711 - Just forget it.<br />- Forget nothin'. Say somethin' funny.
2136840 2139957 Ain't nothin' to say.<br />She's in a bad mood, I'm in a bad mood...
2140080 2142640 You know how to do funny.<br />Wanna go out with her?
2142760 2145115 - Yeah.<br />- Well...
2148240 2150800 - I don't know what to say.<br />- Funny.
2162240 2164674 Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky.
2164800 2166791 Rocky, you know?
2166920 2168876 Listen, uh...
2170360 2174638 I dunno what to say, cos I ain't never<br />talked to no door before, you know?
2175680 2179912 - I mean, what do I say to a door? Listen...<br />- Come on, you're doin' fine.
2180040 2182270 I ain't doin' fine. I look like an idiot.
2182400 2186552 Keep doin' what you're doin'.<br />Funny. I know all about these things.
2186680 2188636 I feel like a jerk.
2194280 2196635 Yo, Adrian. It's Rocky again, you know?
2196760 2198830 Listen, uh...
2198960 2201520 I know you ain't too happy<br />at this moment.
2201640 2206077 Well, could you do me a favour? I ain't<br />got nobody to spend Thanksgiving with.
2206200 2211069 So, uh, how about maybe you and I could<br />go out together and get somethin' to eat?
2211200 2213873 I don't know,<br />maybe laugh a little bit. Who knows?
2214000 2216355 Would you like to, uh...
2217320 2222269 I don't know. Would you like to maybe,<br />you know, you and me go out together?
2227320 2229788 We're gonna have a good time.
2229920 2233310 We'll have a real good time, you know?
2236440 2238795 Thanks for the bird.
2241520 2244478 I'm gonna turn the TV off.<br />I got a headache.
2256200 2258475 - What's your sister like to do?<br />- Ice-skate.
2258600 2263549 Adrian, come on, you're lettin' the heat<br />out. Who pays the bills around here?
2268040 2271589 Listen, uh, I don't want<br />no turkey anyway, you know?
2272640 2276189 - But it was Thanksgiving.<br />- It was what?
2276320 2280472 - It was Thanksgiving.<br />- Yeah, to you, but to me it's Thursday.
2304080 2306548 - Yo, looks kinda quiet.<br />- I think it's closed.
2306680 2309717 No, I think we're just early<br />or somethin' like that.
2309840 2311034 - Yo!<br />- Yo!
2311160 2313071 - We're closed!<br />- What?
2313200 2315919 - I said we're closed!<br />- Yeah. Hey, listen...
2316040 2319191 ...l'm gonna smooth this guy out.<br />Wait here for a few minutes.
2319320 2321515 - We could go someplace else.<br />- No, it's OK.
2321640 2324950 Are you closed to the general public<br />or closed to everybody?
2325080 2329392 It's after six o'clock. It's Thanksgiving.<br />That's why there's nobody here.
2329520 2333638 Besides, you ain't supposed to be in here,<br />so do me a favour and leave, huh?
2333760 2337548 - Could you do me a favour?<br />- Hey, come on, we're not operatin'.
2337680 2340319 Look... this girl here ain't feelin' well.
2340440 2344877 The doctor says she should exercise<br />and ice-skating's the best thing.
2345000 2349198 - Yeah? So what do you want from me?<br />- Do me a favour. She ain't feelin' good.
2349320 2352676 So if you could let her on the ice,<br />I'd appreciate it.
2352800 2356588 - Ten minutes, ten bucks.<br />- Ten bucks? How about eight bucks?
2356720 2358950 Come on! It's Thanksgiving.
2359080 2364029 - All right. Nine bucks, you got a deal.<br />- You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.
2365680 2367238 Gimme the blades.
2368120 2371112 - Aren't you skating?<br />- No, I ain't skated since I was 15.
2371240 2373549 That's when I started fightin'.
2373680 2377150 - Skating's bad for the ankles, you know?<br />- Yeah.
2377280 2379840 You're a pretty good skater, ain't ya?
2380760 2385993 Like I was sayin' on the way over, fightin'<br />used to be tops with me, but no more.
2386120 2388634 All I wanted to do was<br />prove I was no bum...
2388760 2391069 ...that I had the stuff to make a good pro.
2391200 2394670 - You never got the chance?<br />- I ain't cryin', cos I still fight.
2394800 2398156 I kinda do it like a hobby.<br />The trouble is, I'm a southpaw.
2398280 2401158 - What's a southpaw?<br />- It means you're left-handed.
2401280 2403510 A southpaw throws your timin' off, see?
2403640 2407428 Other guys, it makes 'em look awkward.<br />Nobody wants to look awkward.
2407560 2410996 - You know where southpaw came from?<br />- <i>(attendant)</i> Nine minutes!
2411120 2414908 A long time ago, a couple of hundred<br />years ago, this guy was fightin'.
2415040 2418350 I think it was around Philadelphia.<br />He was left-handed.
2418480 2420789 His arm was facin' towards New Jersey.
2420920 2424037 And that's south,<br />so they called him Southpaw.
2424160 2426754 You see? Southpaw, South Jersey...
2426880 2429997 ...South Camden, Southpaw...<br />You know what I mean?
2431560 2433551 Things worked out for the best.
2433680 2436194 You never got a chance,<br />being left-handed?
2436320 2439869 Well, that's absolutely true,<br />you know? Watch out, watch out.
2440000 2442833 Agh! Agh! Agh!
2442960 2446157 I just dislocated my finger.<br />Agh! Look at that.
2446280 2448589 No, hey, wait! It ain't your fault. Look.
2448720 2451632 See? Look.<br />It's an old wound. You see that?
2451760 2455435 Look. See? Nothin'.<br />It bends like that. I originally done it...
2455560 2457516 Push the button... Bong! It works.
2457640 2460996 - It ain't your fault. I'll show you...<br />- Seven minutes!
2461120 2464032 I originally done it...<br />I keep pictures of all my fights.
2464160 2466594 I done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. See?
2466880 2469713 He's the size of an airplane.<br />I broke both my hands.
2469840 2475676 I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,<br />don't you think? See how it works there?
2475800 2477791 Come on. Are you havin' a good time?
2477920 2481833 I'll tell ya, you can see I ain't too graceful.<br />I don't move well.
2481960 2484872 But I can really swat, you know?<br />I can really hit hard.
2485000 2489949 But I'm a southpaw and nobody wants to<br />fight a southpaw, you know what I mean?
2492320 2495995 Whooo!<br />You know how I got started in fightin'?
2496120 2498076 - Huh?<br />- No.
2498200 2500191 Am I talkin' too loud?
2500320 2501673 - No.<br />- Three minutes!
2501800 2506157 My father, he's...<br />My old man, he was never too smart.
2506280 2510717 He says to me "You weren't born<br />much of a brain, so start usin' your body."
2510840 2513195 So I've become a fighter.
2513320 2516676 You know what I mean?<br />Why are you laughin'?
2518040 2520759 My mother, she said the opposite thing.
2520880 2523519 What did she say?<br />What did she say, the opposite?
2523640 2527633 "You weren't born much of a body,<br />so you'd better develop your brain."
2527760 2530797 - Did she say that?<br />- Yo! Time!
2531600 2534398 - Can I ask you a question?<br />- Absolutely.
2535640 2538598 - Why do you wanna fight?<br />- Cos I can't sing or dance.
2538720 2540312 Hey, yo!
2540440 2543079 Don't fall! Don't fall!
2543200 2546875 Hey, that was terrific. I'm good at this.<br />You like the way I skate?
2547000 2549878 The last fight I had was<br />with a guy named Spider Rico.
2550000 2552594 He bust my head up.<br />Do you see that scar?
2552720 2555518 I'll tell ya,<br />things get pretty rough in the ring.
2564640 2568155 You know, some people are<br />very shy by nature, you know?
2568280 2570236 I suppose.
2572640 2575313 I say you're very shy by nature,<br />you know?
2575440 2577396 Yeah... I suppose.
2578480 2580198 Hey! Hey!
2580320 2583551 The bum from the dock.<br />Get a job, ya bum!
2584600 2589151 You know, some people think bein' shy<br />is a disease, but it don't bother me none.
2589280 2591430 It don't bother me, either.
2592400 2596154 Why did I bother bringin' it up?<br />Cos I'm dumb, that's why.
2597840 2602595 I think we make a real sharp couple<br />of coconuts. I'm dumb, you're shy.
2604640 2608315 I don't understand why anybody<br />would wanna be a fighter.
2608440 2610476 Hey, you gotta be a moron.
2610600 2613956 You gotta be a moron to wanna be<br />a fighter, you know what I mean?
2614080 2617390 It's a racket where you're almost<br />guaranteed to end up a bum.
2617520 2620910 - I don't think you're a bum.<br />- I'm at least half a bum, you know?
2621040 2623759 I'll tell ya somethin'.
2623880 2627395 The worst thing about fightin'<br />is the mornin' after, you know?
2627520 2632150 I'll tell ya. The mornin' after a fight, you're<br />nothin' but a large wound, you know?
2632280 2634236 Sometimes I got pains all over me.
2634360 2637796 I wanna call a taxi to take me<br />from the bed into the bathroom.
2637920 2642471 Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt, your face<br />is all busted up, your hands is swollen.
2642600 2646752 Look at this face. 64 fights.<br />Look at that nose. See that nose?
2646880 2649110 That nose ain't been broken in 64 fights.
2649240 2653597 I've had guys bustin' on it,<br />chewin' on it, twistin' it, punchin' it.
2653720 2657759 I mean, whack, boom. These guys<br />are hittin' my nose all the time.
2657880 2661350 Never broke. I'm proud of that.<br />Ain't that rare? That's rare.
2661480 2664597 - Why do you do it if it hurts?<br />- Why you think?
2665760 2670675 - Cos you can't sing or dance?<br />- Yeah, somethin' like that.
2670800 2672870 Hey, you wanna come inside?
2675320 2678232 - No, I gotta go.<br />- Hey, come on. I got some animals.
2678360 2682114 I got these very rare animals inside.<br />Come on. Come on in.
2682240 2687030 - No, no. I gotta go.<br />- I gotta go too. I gotta go to the bathroom.
2687160 2689674 - Go on.<br />- No, I gotta go.
2689800 2692712 Hey, look at this face.<br />Is that a face you could trust?
2692840 2697550 Huh? Is it? They oughta stick this face<br />on a stamp. What do you think?
2697680 2700035 Huh? Come on. Come on in.
2705440 2707670 Yo.
2726680 2728636 Flick.
2733240 2736232 - Yo, Adrian, you hungry?<br />- No.
2736360 2740956 I got some things in there. I got soda,<br />some doughnuts or somethin'.
2741080 2743275 A couple of cupcakes, huh?
2743400 2746517 No? I think I got some chocolate in there.
2746640 2748596 No?
2755480 2757835 Hot in here, you know?
2759240 2761595 I could go for some music.
2766640 2768392 Yo, Adrian.
2768520 2771080 These are the exotic animals<br />I told you about.
2771200 2774431 - These are my friends Cuff and Link.<br />- I sold 'em to ya.
2774560 2778314 Sure, I know you sold 'em to me.<br />You were workin' at that pet shop.
2778440 2781796 First day you was there,<br />I bought both these animals.
2781920 2786675 Sure, I remember that. I bought this bowl<br />and I bought the animals themselves...
2786800 2789758 ...the food,<br />the marbles that go on the bottom there.
2789880 2795637 Remember that mountain? I had to get rid<br />of it, cos they kept fallin' over and flippin'.
2798600 2801353 Yo, why don't you come on<br />over here and sit down?
2801480 2803311 Hm?
2803440 2805590 It's a nice couch. I don't know...
2807560 2811348 There's big bugs in there, you know?<br />It's safer over here.
2813160 2815116 You wanna sit down?
2820440 2822635 Are these your parents?
2822760 2824990 Yeah, that's both of 'em there.
2825120 2827634 - Is this you?<br />- Yeah, that's me when I was eight.
2827760 2830957 That's the Italian Stallion<br />when he was a baby.
2832880 2837237 Why don't you come on over and<br />make yourself comfortable? Relax.
2841120 2843634 - Do you have a phone?<br />- No, I ain't got no phone.
2843760 2846957 I had it pulled,<br />cos of people callin' all the time.
2847080 2850550 Who needs the aggravation, right?<br />The interruptions.
2850680 2854832 - Who do you wanna call?<br />- I wanna let my brother know where I am.
2855760 2858149 Why?
2858280 2863035 - I think he might be worried.<br />- Well, I'll call him, if that's the problem.
2865440 2870230 Yo, Paulie! Your sister's with me!<br />I'll call ya's back later! See ya!
2876560 2878630 You don't like the room, do ya?
2878760 2881832 - It's fine.<br />- Well, it's only temporary, you know?
2882120 2884076 It's not that.
2888440 2893389 What's the problem? You don't like <i>me?</i><br />Or the turtles? What's the problem?
2893680 2896478 - I don't think I belong here.<br />- It's OK.
2899000 2901275 I don't belong here.
2901400 2905439 Well, you know, it's OK,<br />cos you're my guest, you know?
2905560 2908313 I don't... know you well enough.
2908440 2912228 I've never been in<br />a man's apartment alone.
2913440 2916398 Well, I have.<br />They're all the same, you know?
2921120 2923680 I'm not sure I know you well enough.
2924840 2926876 I don't feel comfortable.
2927000 2930754 Yo, Adrian, you know,<br />I ain't so comfortable either.
2932040 2935271 - I should go.<br />- Don't go, please. Don't go.
2935400 2937709 Don't go. Don't go.
2937840 2939796 Don't go.
2942600 2945239 - Do me a favour?<br />- What?
2945360 2947715 Take off these glasses.
2950840 2953195 You have nice eyes, you know?
2954720 2957393 Do me another favour?
2957520 2959875 Would you take off that hat?
2965840 2968195 I always knew you was pretty.
2969160 2971913 - Don't tease me.<br />- I'm not teasin' ya.
2975080 2977719 I ain't teasin' ya.
2977840 2980195 I just... I wanna kiss ya.
2982880 2985917 You don't have to kiss me back<br />if you don't want...
2986040 2987996 ...but I wanna kiss you.
3056840 3058796 I heard you had a fight comin' up.
3058920 3061798 Yeah, I'm gonna fight next month,<br />January 27th.
3061920 3066914 That's good, man. You come on down<br />the gym. We'll see that you get in shape.
3067040 3068951 Hey, Rock, how you doin'?
3069080 3072152 - Mick was lookin' for you up there, man.<br />- For me? You sure?
3072280 3076432 Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was lookin' for you.<br />Get on up there and see him.
3093520 3097718 - You got somethin' for me?<br />- A guy from Miles Jergens was here.
3097840 3101753 - They need sparrin' partners for Creed.<br />- When was he here?
3101880 3105953 - About an hour ago.<br />- Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
3106360 3109033 I said that before, you dumb dago!
3110080 3114312 I've been comin' here for six years<br />and you always stick it to me. How come?
3114440 3117318 - You don't wanna know!<br />- Yeah, I wanna know how come!
3117440 3119476 - You wanna know?<br />- I wanna know!
3119600 3124196 OK, I'm gonna tell ya! Cos you had<br />the talent to become a good fighter!
3124320 3127039 And instead of that,<br />you became a leg-breaker...
3127160 3130197 ...to some cheap, second-rate loan shark!
3130320 3133232 - It's a livin'.<br />- It's a waste of life!
3151240 3153390 Yes? May I help you?
3158080 3160310 Oh! You must be Mr Rocky Balboa.
3160440 3163398 Mr Jergens is expecting you.<br />Just a moment.
3168160 3170913 Mr Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.
3171040 3172951 Fine.
3173080 3175355 - Please go in, Mr Balboa.<br />- Can I have that?
3175480 3177835 - Oh, certainly.<br />- Thanks.
3182160 3184196 Mr Balboa.
3184320 3187790 How are you? George Jergens.<br />Take a chair, please.
3187920 3189876 Thanks.
3190680 3193240 - Mr Balboa...<br />- You can call me Rocky.
3193360 3197751 Rocky. Tell me, Rocky. You got any<br />representation? You have a manager?
3197880 3199836 Uh, no, just me.
3200960 3204509 Rocky, I've got a proposition<br />I'd like to make to you.
3204640 3207871 - About sparrin'?<br />- I beg your pardon?
3208000 3212357 I know you're lookin' for sparrin' partners<br />and I wanna say I'm very available.
3212480 3215677 - I'm sure you are.<br />- Absolutely. It would be an honour.
3215800 3218758 And you know what?<br />I wouldn't take no cheap shots.
3218880 3223670 - I'd really be a good sparrin' partner.<br />- You don't understand me, Rocky.
3223800 3228669 My proposition's this. Would you be<br />interested in fighting Apollo Creed...
3228800 3231553 ...for the world<br />heavyweight championship?
3235880 3238235 - No.<br />- Listen, Rocky...
3239480 3241596 ...Apollo's seen you fight.
3242080 3245038 He likes you. He wants to fight you.
3245160 3248914 Well, it's just that, you see, uh,<br />I fight in clubs, you know?
3249040 3253431 I'm really a ham and egger. This guy is<br />the best. It wouldn't be such a good fight.
3253560 3257348 But thank you very much,<br />you know? I appreciate it.
3257720 3261952 Rocky, do you believe that America<br />is the land of opportunity?
3263240 3264912 Yeah.
3265040 3267031 Apollo Creed does.
3267160 3271790 And he's gonna prove it to the world<br />by giving an unknown a shot at the title.
3271920 3274639 And that unknown is you.
3274760 3276910 He picked you, Rocky.
3277720 3280837 Rocky, it's the chance of a lifetime.
3280960 3283110 You can't pass it by.
3284000 3286150 What do ya say?
3290080 3293868 <i>All right. That's enough pictures.</i><br /><i>We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.</i>
3293960 3296394 <i>How do you like</i><br /><i>the city of brotherly love?</i>
3296520 3299830 <i>Well, just bein' in Philadelphia</i><br /><i>makes me feel patriotic.</i>
3299960 3303509 <i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city</i><br /><i>wishin' me the best.</i>
3303640 3306996 <i>I love my Philadelphia brothers.</i><br /><i>I'm proud to be an American.</i>
3307120 3311671 <i>Apollo, why did you agree to fight a man</i><br /><i>who has virtually no chance of winning?</i>
3311800 3313916 <i>Look, if history proves one thing...</i>
3314040 3317555 <i>American history proves that</i><br /><i>everybody's got a chance to win.</i>
3317680 3321150 <i>Didn't you guys ever hear of</i><br /><i>Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>
3321280 3324352 <i>It is a coincidence that</i><br /><i>you're fighting a white man...</i>
3324480 3326675 <i>... on the most celebrated day</i><br /><i>in US history?</i>
3326800 3332193 <i>I don't know. Is it a coincidence that he's</i><br /><i>fightin' a black man on the same day?</i>
3332320 3334276 <i>Right on! Tell the truth, brother!</i>
3334400 3336789 <i>How do you feel about your challenger?</i>
3336920 3339878 <i>How do I feel about him?</i><br /><i>Come here, Rock.</i>
3340000 3343834 <i>- My main man. Rocky, ain't you Italian?</i><br /><i>- Yeah, I'm Italian.</i>
3343960 3348511 <i>- Well now, what does that mean?</i><br /><i>- If he can't fight, I bet he can cook!</i>
3350080 3353914 - Do me a favour. His lungs, punch out.<br />- Paulie!
3354040 3357316 <i>Rocky,</i><br /><i>how do you expect to fight Apollo Creed?</i>
3357440 3361399 <i>Well, jeez, Creed's the best.</i><br /><i>I guess I'll have to do the best I can.</i>
3361520 3364193 <i>Tell me, Rocky. Just between us...</i>
3364320 3367118 <i>... where did you get</i><br /><i>the name "ltalian Stallion"?</i>
3367240 3371472 <i>Oh, I invented that about eight years ago</i><br /><i>when I was eatin' dinner.</i>
3371600 3377470 <i>Rocky, now your payday will be $150,000.</i><br /><i>Any comment?</i>
3379160 3381390 <i>- You got no comment, Rocky, right?</i><br /><i>- No.</i>
3381520 3383238 <i>No comment, right.</i>
3383360 3386830 <i>Wait a minute.</i><br /><i>I just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, OK?</i>
3386960 3391078 <i>Yo, Adrian! It's me, Rocky.</i><br /><i>Look at this. Can you believe all this?</i>
3391200 3394033 Rocky, you didn't...!
3394160 3396958 <i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i><br /><i>- Quit pushin', man!</i>
3397080 3398149 <i>Thank you, Rocky.</i>
3398280 3402114 Don't it matter he's makin' you out a fool?<br />I'd break his lips.
3402240 3405277 - He's takin' cheap shots.<br />- It don't bother me none.
3405400 3410235 Yo, Rock. I guess you'd be lookin'<br />for people to help you out.
3410360 3412920 - Help what?<br />- You know...
3413040 3416715 - Keep you livin' a clean life.<br />- I do OK, you know?
3416840 3420992 You need someone to help with<br />the exercise, stand by with a towel...
3421120 3422758 ...run errands.
3422880 3427715 Who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.<br />I think I'm gonna train myself, you know?
3427840 3432550 Without such good people around to help,<br />you don't have such a good chance.
3432680 3435478 Einstein flunked outta school. Twice.
3435600 3437795 - That so?<br />- Yeah.
3437920 3443199 Beethoven was deaf, Helen Keller was<br />blind. I think Rocky's got a good chance.
3448960 3452475 - Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?<br />- You lookin' to do a good deed?
3452600 3455319 Keep outta my freakin' life!
3455680 3457636 - What did I do?<br />- Nothin'.
3457760 3460479 - Did I say something?<br />- You didn't say nothin'.
3460600 3464673 That's right, you didn't say nothin'!<br />Nothin' at all!
3466240 3468196 I gotta go.
3468760 3471115 Where's the freakin' pretzels?
3474000 3477549 Goddamn the pretzels!<br />Hey, we don't have any beer!
3478680 3482036 I thought you were supposed<br />to pick up some beer!
3489280 3492556 How'd you like hearin'<br />your name on TV tonight?
3493600 3496194 I was shocked. Why'd you do that?
3496320 3500029 - Come on, you're puttin' me on, right?<br />- Absolutely.
3500160 3503789 - What time should I expect you?<br />- Oh, about seven.
3503920 3505876 Hey.
3518800 3520756 Hey.
3521720 3525190 You know I said that stuff on TV<br />didn't bother me none?
3525320 3527276 Yeah?
3528920 3530876 It did.
3540360 3543636 Listen, the reason I've<br />brought you here is because...
3543760 3546069 Have you got money<br />for trainin' expenses?
3546200 3549988 - I got a few dollars, you know?<br />- Well, here. Put this in your glove.
3550120 3553476 - What's this?<br />- 500 bucks. Don't worry about it.
3554400 3558473 You ain't never had any luck, but this time<br />Lady Luck may be in your corner.
3558600 3561478 - What do ya think?<br />- Maybe. Maybe...
3561600 3566674 - Hey, thanks for the money, Tony.<br />- It's OK. Don't worry about it. See ya.
3566800 3568199 - Wait a minute.<br />- What?
3568320 3571073 - You're in trainin'. Huh? Come on.<br />- Hey.
3578480 3580596 - Yo, Tony?<br />- What?
3580720 3582711 You gonna show up at the fight?
3582840 3584956 - Ringside.<br />- Hey, hey!
3586560 3588516 I'll see ya.
3621520 3623476 <i>(Rocky)</i> Yeah!
3628160 3631436 Hello, kid. I seen your light.<br />Can I come in?
3631560 3633630 - Yeah, sure.<br />- Yeah. Good!
3633760 3636399 Hey, this is a nice place here.
3636520 3639557 Anyway, what I come to tell you<br />is that, uh...
3640720 3643837 ...that what happened to you is freak luck.
3643960 3646997 - Yeah, freak luck.<br />- Ain't it true? Look at the other guys.
3647120 3650795 They're good fighters.<br />They're colourful, they got good records.
3650920 3653150 They fight their guts out for peanuts.
3653280 3657193 But you... you got a shot at the title.
3657320 3660710 - Freak luck is a strange thing.<br />- Yeah, sure it is. Can I sit down?
3660840 3663149 Yeah, sure.
3663280 3666636 - What the hell are those?<br />- Oh, they're domestic turtles.
3666760 3670230 The one on top is Cuff and<br />the other is Link. The rest are marbles.
3670360 3673670 Yeah? They make good soup, do they?
3673800 3677236 Anyway, look, I'm here to warn ya...
3677360 3681638 ...that you gotta be very careful<br />about this shot that you got at the title.
3681760 3686595 Because, I don't know, like the Bible says,<br />you ain't gonna get a second chance.
3687440 3690671 - Yeah, all right.<br />- You thought of that, huh?
3690800 3693837 Well, what you need is a manager.
3694760 3696796 A manager. Listen to me.
3696920 3700356 I know, because I've been<br />in this racket for 50 years.
3700480 3703597 - 50 years, huh?<br />- 50 years. God, I've seen it all.
3703720 3706359 All of it. You know what I done?
3706480 3708914 - What?<br />- I have done it all.
3709040 3712589 You shoulda seen me when<br />I knocked Giny Russel outta the ring.
3712720 3716599 Outta the goddamn ring, I tell ya.<br />September 14, 1923.
3716720 3720599 And it was the same night that<br />Firpo knocks Dempsey outta the ring.
3720720 3723632 - The same night. Who gets the publicity?<br />- Dempsey.
3723760 3725955 - That's right, but why?<br />- Cos he was champ.
3726080 3729072 No! Because he had a manager.
3729200 3731714 I had nothin', man.
3731840 3735276 I wanna show you somethin'.<br />Look at my face for a minute. Look.
3735400 3740110 I got 21 stitches over this left eye.<br />I got 34 stitches over this eye.
3740240 3743596 You know what?<br />I had my nose busted 17 times.
3743720 3747713 The last time was with<br />that fight with Sailor Mike.
3747840 3750718 I got the clippin' here. A good fight.
3750840 3752671 Read that.
3752800 3754756 Well, it doesn't matter.
3754880 3757952 Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear.
3759160 3762232 Ah, Rocky Marciano!
3763360 3767273 You know, you kinda remind me<br />of the Rock, do you know that?
3767400 3770870 - You really think so?<br />- That's right. You move like him.
3771000 3772956 And you got heart, like he did.
3773080 3776197 Yeah, I got heart,<br />but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?
3779760 3782354 Uh... anyway, you know...
3782480 3785358 ...when I begun in this business, kid...
3786480 3790996 Look, I wanna make a suggestion.<br />Don't drink that piss before a fight.
3791120 3794715 It's no good for ya.<br />You don't mind my sayin'...?
3794840 3799277 Anyway, when I started this racket,<br />pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.
3799400 3804872 For $10, you gotta tear somebody's throat<br />out. But I never had no management.
3805400 3810076 One time, this son of a bitch<br />that I fought, he put a nail right there.
3810200 3812270 - In his thumb?<br />- Yeah, in the glove.
3812400 3814755 And he punched<br />so many holes in my face...
3814880 3819795 ...I had this spit shootin' outta my cheeks.<br />Can you imagine that?
3819920 3823276 When I tell you what I looked like<br />when I was in my prime...
3823400 3826153 I want ya to look at somethin'.<br />Will ya look at that?
3826280 3830273 That's the way I looked<br />before these guys got at me.
3830400 3833790 That's nice.<br />You don't take care of the picture, though.
3833920 3837833 Well, I never had no management.<br />That was the trouble.
3837960 3842351 Now I got all this knowledge.<br />I got it up here and I wanna give it to you.
3842480 3846871 I wanna take care of you. I wanna make<br />sure all this shit that happened to me...
3847000 3850515 ...doesn't happen to you.<br />You know what I mean?
3850640 3854269 - The fight's set.<br />- Listen to me. I wanna be your manager.
3854400 3857949 - You follow that, do you?<br />- The fight's set. I don't need no manager.
3858080 3862471 But you can't buy what I'm gonna give ya.<br />I've got pain and I've got experience.
3862600 3865637 I got pain and I got experience too.
3865760 3869275 - Now listen, kid...<br />- Hey, yo. Hey, Mick.
3869400 3873279 I needed your help about ten years ago.<br />You never helped me none.
3873400 3876472 - You didn't care.<br />- Well, if you wanted help...
3876600 3880479 I say, if you wanted help,<br />why didn't you just ask me, kid?
3880600 3883956 Look, I asked,<br />but you never heard nothin'!
3884080 3886036 Well, I...
3886840 3888796 I, uh...
3889600 3891955 I'm 76 years old.
3896000 3897956 And, uh...
3919400 3921356 Ah, shit.
3931440 3934273 Took you long enough to get here.
3934400 3939076 Ten years to come to my house. What's<br />the matter? You don't like my house?
3939200 3941430 My house stink?
3941560 3943790 That's right. It stinks!
3943920 3946229 I didn't ask no favours from you!
3946360 3948351 Don't throw it around!
3948800 3952713 Talkin' about your prime.<br />What about <i>my</i> prime, Mick?
3953120 3955475 At least you had a prime!
3955600 3960549 I ain't had no prime! I ain't had nothin'!<br />Legs are goin', everything's goin'!
3960680 3965674 Guy offers me a fight. Big deal! Wanna<br />fight the fight? Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.
3965800 3969190 I'm gonna go and fight that big fight.<br />I'm gonna get that!

3979000 3983676 Legs ain't workin', nothing's workin'!<br />They go "Go on, fight the champ!"
3983800 3985756 Yeah, I'll fight him.
3987920 3990559 Get my face kicked in.
3990680 3995629 You come around here! You wanna move<br />in with me? Come on in! It's a nice house!

4283800 4286155 No, across the street.

4290520 4293478 - It's a little cold in here, ain't it?<br />- Yeah.
4297920 4300275 Who killed all these things?
4300400 4303790 - What, are you crazy?<br />- Pay Gazzo or you end up on a hook.
4303920 4306229 Hey, Gazzo's a good man. You know that.
4306360 4311798 Hey, don't get excited. I know that. That's<br />why I want you to talk to him about me.
4311920 4314309 I can get me out of this stinkin' freezer.
4314440 4319719 Why don't you do yourself a favour?<br />Keep this job, because you eat better.

4324080 4328039 Uh, you and my sister.<br />How are you gettin' along together?
4329000 4330956 How you think?
4331080 4333913 Uh, I'm not sure, Rock. What's the story?
4334560 4338439 - About what?<br />- What's the story? What's happening?
4338560 4341518 - You really like her?<br />- Sure I like her.
4343880 4347190 I don't see it. What's the attraction?
4347320 4350630 I don't know. It fills gaps, I guess.
4350760 4354753 - What's "gaps"?<br />- I don't know. She's got gaps, I got gaps.
4354880 4357474 Together we fill gaps. I don't know...
4358760 4360830 You ballin' her?
4360960 4362313 Hey!
4362440 4365398 Hey, you don't talk dirty about your sister.
4366800 4369155 You screwin' my sister?
4371200 4374510 You see? That's why I can't<br />connect you with Gazzo, Paulie.
4374640 4378679 Because you got a big mouth, you know?<br />You just talk too much.
4378800 4382873 - It's gettin' cold in here. I'm goin' home.<br />- Cold in here?! It <i>is</i> cold in here!
4383000 4386197 It stinks in here! And you stink!
4410680 4412750 <i>(cracking)</i>
4412880 4415440 You're breakin' the ribs.
4433480 4437632 If you do that to Apollo Creed,<br />they'll put us in jail for murder.
4439280 4441840 I'll see you tomorrow mornin', OK?
4453760 4456354 - I turned the heat up.<br />- Thanks.
4456480 4461235 You know, your brother's a good man,<br />but he's awful pushy, you know?
4469880 4474476 - You want me to rub you down?<br />- No, I'm just sore, OK? I'll just sit here.
4474600 4476955 - You sure?<br />- Yeah, I'm sure.
4480200 4483078 Hey, come on. No foolin' around, all right?
4483200 4485077 I'm tired.
4485200 4487156 Hey, Adrian, I'm serious now.
4487280 4491159 There's no foolin' around durin' trainin'.<br />I wanna stay strong.
4491280 4494238 - You're not kiddin'.<br />- No, I ain't kiddin'.
4496880 4498711 - You sure?<br />- Yeah, I'm sure.
4498840 4501434 Why don't you just make the meat, OK?
4503240 4505390 OK, I'll make the meat.
4528040 4529996 Yo.
4530720 4533188 - It's OK.<br />- I'm sorry.
4533320 4535276 Hey.
4537240 4539196 Hey, c'mon.
4540080 4542036 C'mon.
4561680 4563750 Underneath. Underneath.
4563880 4566599 Underneath! Underneath! Come on!
4566720 4569188 Rock, hold it, hold it.<br />Hold it, Rock, will ya?
4569320 4572869 You're drivin' me crazy,<br />you're so sloppy. You're off balance.
4573000 4577790 Let's try this. Take this string. Tie it<br />to both ankles. Leave two feet of slack.
4577920 4581549 - I ain't never had good footwork.<br />- Never mind. You're off balance.
4581680 4586595 Marciano... He had the same problem<br />and this string cured it.
4586720 4590952 The idea is that if you can move<br />and hit without breakin' the string...
4591080 4594789 ...you got balance. You become<br />a dangerous person. You follow?
4594920 4597354 - You're lookin' good, Rock.<br />- Thanks.
4597480 4599198 That's it. Underneath!
4599320 4601709 Hey, Rock, how about an autograph?
4601840 4605992 Get outta here! Don't you ever interrupt<br />me while I'm conductin' business.
4606120 4608714 Move your little chicken asses out.
4608840 4612628 Listen, kid. You...<br />You lay off that pet-shop dame.
4612760 4615069 Women weaken legs.
4616320 4620472 - Yeah, but I really like this girl...<br />- Then let her train ya!
4623000 4625958 - OK, no more foolin' around.<br />- OK, now hit it.
4628040 4630793 Women weaken legs, huh?
4634600 4636955 - Yo, Rock!<br />- Yo, Rocky!
4642840 4645115 Yo!
4645240 4647629 - Yo!<br />- Yo, you look great.
4648760 4651149 - Really?<br />- Oh, yeah. Terrific.
4651280 4653555 I mean, you're gonna be a heartbreaker.
4653680 4657514 You'll walk down the street,<br />breakin' hearts. Very sharp.
4657640 4660438 - I got another surprise for you.<br />- What?
4661400 4665791 Hey, Butkus! Hey, Butkus,<br />gimme a kiss! Come here!
4665920 4669230 - To keep you company when you run.<br /><i>- (Rocky howls)</i>

4673000 4675833 Come and meet the family.<br />The owner never come back?
4675960 4678633 - He's yours if you want him.<br />- Boy, do I want him!
4678760 4681513 - What's he eat, this dog?<br />- He eats little turtles.
4681640 4683790 Yo, Butkus!
4706040 4709715 What's that, Butkus, huh?<br />Whose truck is this? C'mon.
4712000 4714560 One call from me, you're a celebrity.
4716440 4719238 - You need exposure.<br />- Don't breathe on me, Paulie.
4719360 4721920 That's the big time...<br />I know about these things.
4722040 4725396 - What do these guys want from me, huh?<br />- To watch you train.
4725520 4728273 Hey, what is the matter with you?<br />This is private.
4728400 4731631 - I'm doin' you a favour.<br />- No, you're embarrassin' me...
4731760 4734672 ...in front of everybody,<br />in front of your sister.
4734800 4738509 You see this cigar? Stick it in your ear.<br />Don't do these things to me.
4738640 4742758 You shoulda called me up or somethin'.<br />Leave a message. Don't do that!
4742880 4745235 My sister really likes you.
4746040 4749635 - I'm gonna kill you one of these days!<br />- Come on, come on.
4749760 4751716 - Pretty...<br />- Baby.
4751840 4756152 Here he is, the next heavyweight<br />champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!
4756280 4759397 Rocky Balboa, we wanna get<br />a brief interview in with you.
4759520 4760999 - What about me?<br />- What about you?
4761120 4763395 - In charge of the meat.<br />- Stand behind it.
4763520 4765670 Listen, just settle down. Just relax.
4765800 4768394 What we're going to do<br />is ask you a few questions...
4768520 4770909 ...about your unique training method.
4771040 4774635 Talk to the folks at home.<br />They wanna know how you got into this.
4774760 4779356 This isn't an everyday thing. Jimmy,<br />you guys ready? Rocky, turn around here.
4779480 4783439 - Just don't take no cheap shots.<br />- No, I won't do that. Just relax.
4783560 4787758 Today we're here with heavyweight<br />challenger Rocky Balboa. The reason...
4787880 4790952 Hey, freak guy's stickin' his face in.
4791080 4792911 Let's try it again, Rocky.
4793640 4796712 <i>Today we're with heavyweight</i><br /><i>challenger Rocky Balboa.</i>
4796840 4799149 <i>The reason we're in this refrigerated box...</i>
4799280 4802192 <i>... is that Mr Balboa has</i><br /><i>an unusual method of training.</i>

4805960 4809714 <i>But first, Rocky,</i><br /><i>how did you come to train in an icebox?</i>
4809840 4813116 <i>Uh, well, my friend,</i><br /><i>the guy over there, he let me in one day.</i>
4813240 4815196 <i>I hit the beef and I kinda liked it.</i>
4815320 4818710 <i>Since I've become a challenger,</i><br /><i>the owner don't mind neither.</i>
4818840 4822753 <i>Is this a common training method?</i><br /><i>Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i>
4822880 4827829 <i>- No, I think I invented it.</i><br /><i>- Would you give us a demonstration?</i>
4827960 4831316 <i>(Apollo)</i> And be sure<br />to fly my barber to Philly.
4834120 4836680 How much is going to<br />West Coast advertising?
4836800 4839030 - $300,000.<br />- Make it 450.
4839160 4841196 Send the mayor's wife 200 roses...

4844240 4847038 Do you want to run<br />15 radio spots in the Midwest?
4847160 4849720 You could spend better<br />in Canadian publicity.
4849840 4854789 Either way, I've got friends in Toronto<br />who could get you good tax breaks.
4854920 4857275 George, I like your friends.
4863880 4868908 Hey, champ, you oughta come and look<br />at this boy you're gonna fight on TV.

5476320 5478880 Mr Jergens, the poster's wrong.

5493200 5496476 Try to get some rest, kid. Good night.
5585240 5587310 I can't do it.

5591760 5593716 I can't beat him.
5594720 5596676 Apollo?
5596800 5599075 Yeah.
5599200 5602158 I been out there, walking around, thinkin'.

5632400 5634755 You worked so hard.
5635880 5639236 Yeah, it don't matter,<br />cos I was nobody before.
5641240 5643390 Don't say that.
5643520 5646876 Come on, Adrian. It's true. I was nobody.
5649040 5651600 But that don't matter either, you know?
5652600 5654750 Cos I was thinkin'...
5655600 5658558 It really don't matter if I lose this fight.
5660200 5664159 It really don't matter if this guy<br />opens my head either.
5665200 5668158 Cos all I wanna do is go the distance.
5672280 5675875 Nobody's ever<br />gone the distance with Creed.
5676000 5678355 And if I can go that distance...
5679400 5682756 ...and that bell rings and I'm still standin'...
5687520 5691069 ...l'm gonna know for<br />the first time in my life, see...
5692640 5696599 ...that I weren't just another<br />bum from the neighbourhood.
5760240 5762390 Time, kid. Let's go.
5765000 5767355 I'll wait for you here.
5769080 5772470 Well, how about I wait here and you fight,<br />you know?
5772600 5775956 You're lookin' very great today.<br />You know that? Mm?
5777520 5780478 I gotta go now,<br />but don't you leave town, huh?
5781800 5784712 Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it.
5784840 5786717 Good luck.
5786840 5790196 Say, Adrian, you don't think<br />this robe is too baggy, you know?
5790320 5793232 - Good luck.<br />- Don't leave town.
5795360 5798830 I'd like you to meet the man<br />working the fight with me, Stu Nahan.

5804840 5808594 What the hell is that? I trained you<br />to be a fighter, not a billboard.
5808720 5811473 - I'm doin' it for a friend.<br />- What do you get out of it?
5811600 5815149 - Paulie gets three grand, I get the robe.<br />- Shrewd.
5815280 5817999 On tonight's fight,<br />their difference in style...
5818120 5821874 ...a recent magazine said it could be<br />the caveman against the cavalier.
5822000 5826437 The buzzing in the background could be<br />the challenger getting into the ring.
5826560 5832351 - Rocky! Look at me! Ya cost me $200.<br />- Oh. I gotta go. I gotta work.
5832480 5834675 - How's the robe?<br />- A little baggy.
5834800 5837678 <i>(Bill)</i> A 50-1 underdog,<br />a Cinderella story...
5837800 5841679 ...and he's captured people's<br />imaginations all over the world.
5845640 5847835 We love you, Rocky!
5847960 5850554 - Yo, champ!<br />- Hey, thanks for showin' up.
5850680 5855037 <i>(Stu)</i> His record: 44 victories -<br />38 by knockout. And he's lost 20 fights.
5855160 5857594 <i>(Bill)</i> Which makes me wonder,<br />can he stand it?
5857720 5862032 The stamina and the skill to last<br />the three rounds? Las Vegas odds say no.
5862160 5865470 Rocky Balboa climbing into the ring now.
5865600 5870435 The Italian Stallion. Some meat sign<br />on the back of his robe there. See that?
5870560 5872710 "Shamrock Meat Company."
5872840 5876913 <i>(Stu)</i> There's a lot of noise.<br />You could go deaf with that noise!
5877040 5879235 Am I seeing right back there?
5879360 5882397 Is that the world heavyweight champion,<br />Apollo Creed?
5882520 5886479 <i>(Bill)</i> He's riding in a boat. Is he<br />supposed to be George Washington?
5886600 5889239 Obviously so.<br />He's got the hat on. Look at that.
5889360 5893114 <i>(Stu)</i> Well, it's been confirmed.<br />The world champion Apollo Creed...
5893240 5896391 <i>... is</i> doing an imitation<br />of George Washington.
5897480 5899152 He's throwing money.
5899280 5903319 Remember when we talked about<br />George Washington throwing a dollar?
5903440 5908036 Of course, throwing a dollar<br />in those days went a lot farther.
5908160 5911118 The white wig came off,<br />the hat came off...
5912040 5914508 I want all of you!
5914640 5919760 And the crowd is loving every minute of it.<br />Here is the world heavyweight champion.
5919880 5924192 <i>(Bill)</i> For you around the world,<br />he was dressed as George Washington.
5924320 5927278 I want all of you! Come on, Stallion!
5930560 5933279 - <i>(Stu)</i> Uncle Sam himself...<br />- I want all of you!
5933400 5938315 - All of you! I want all of you!<br />- He looks like a big flag.
5938440 5940829 I want you! You!
5941600 5943511 - Is he talkin' to me?<br />- He is.
5943640 5945756 - Is he talkin' to me?<br />- Let him talk.
5945880 5948269 I want the Stallion! Come on!
5948400 5951153 <i>(Bill)</i> He says "I want the Stallion!"
5952000 5955993 In foreign countries during World War I<br />there was a picture of Uncle Sam...
5956120 5957951 ...with his finger pointed -
5958080 5962358 ...a recruiting poster for our fellows<br />in the army and the navy. "I want you!"
5962480 5964436 <i>(Stu)</i> That's what he's doing a take on.
5964560 5967358 - That's it. "Creed" he's yelling.<br />- "Creed in three."
5967480 5969755 What do you think that outfit cost?

6084600 6087160 <i>(cheering and some booing)</i>

6098960 6102032 ...undefeated in 46 fights...
6102440 6104954 ...the Master of Disaster...
6105080 6108516 ...the undisputed<br />heavyweight champion of the world...

6117640 6119835 You, chump! I want you!
6119960 6122235 You've both fought in Philadelphia before.
6122360 6126114 You know the rules. No low blows.<br />Watch your heads. No buttin'.
6126240 6131189 - Shake hands now and come out fightin'.<br />- Put your hands up, chump. Come on!
6131320 6135598 <i>(Bill)</i> A little body play goin' on there.<br />Rocky taking it carefully, though.
6135720 6139349 He's just going over and being calm,<br />it looks like from here.
6139480 6141914 There goes the big hat.
6144240 6148313 <i>(Stu)</i> I've never seen a fighter<br />that concerned about his hair!
6156000 6159037 And there's the bell for round one.
6159160 6163358 The fighters come out into the centre<br />of the ring, looking at each other.
6163480 6168235 Creed the champion zipping those<br />left-handed jabs, right in the head.
6170360 6173511 The champ stinging<br />the slower challenger jabs at will.
6173640 6177474 In fact, it looks like Rocky is<br />blocking the blows with his face.
6177600 6181832 The champion doesn't look the best<br />he's ever been, but he's moving smoothly.
6181960 6185748 Well, the champion is smiling now.<br />He's toying with his man.
6185880 6190396 Tryin' to give the fans their money's<br />worth. He's makin' a show of it.
6190520 6193876 And a very badly outclassed<br />challenger right now.
6196040 6198110 <i>(Bill)</i> Creed trying to<br />make this man make...
6198240 6201038 See? Make him miss like that.
6201160 6203799 <i>(Stu)</i> Oh, the champ<br />is just taunting him now.
6206720 6209075 Creed dancing around.
6210000 6212389 I don't believe it! The champ is down!
6212520 6214476 <i>(Bill)</i> Yes, he is!
6219560 6222597 Creed is down! What a surprise this is!
6223880 6227998 <i>(Stu)</i> This is the first time the champion<br />has ever been knocked down.
6229320 6231709 Six! Seven! Eight!
6231840 6234877 He appears to be all right.<br />Glancin' around...
6235240 6239472 <i>(Mickey)</i> Come on, Rock! Go to the ribs!<br />Let's go to work right now, Rock!
6240960 6245112 <i>(Bill)</i> Rocky comes back out. He's like<br />a bull in a china closet. He really wants it.
6245240 6247754 Apollo, left to the head.
6247880 6252158 <i>(Stu)</i> Now the champion's comin' back.<br />He's comin' off the floor now.
6253000 6258518 <i>(Bill)</i> Another left, another right.<br />Combinations into the face. That's Apollo!
6261480 6264756 Now the champ is taunting Rocky<br />to come and get some more.
6264880 6266791 Left. Another.
6266920 6268956 Another left!
6269920 6272275 And Rocky's coming back now!
6273040 6275793 Left! Right! Rocky's got him on the rope!
6276560 6278710 OK, let's break it.
6283000 6286549 There's no way they expected<br />this kind of hitting power.
6286680 6290878 But the ability of the champion,<br />Apollo, is apparent.
6292920 6297232 <i>(Stu)</i> Apollo unloading,<br />Rocky really tight against the ropes.
6297360 6299316 <i>(bell)</i>
6303880 6308317 They're leading him back over to his<br />corner. Rocky can hardly find his way.
6308440 6311398 - I told ya! I told ya!<br />- Your nose is broke.
6311520 6313715 - How does it look?<br />- It's an improvement.
6313840 6316991 I want you to quit chuckin' and jivin'.<br />Stick and move.
6317120 6318633 Go for the ribs.
6318760 6322275 - Don't let that bastard breathe.<br />- The guy's great.
6322400 6325870 He doesn't know it's a damn show.<br />He thinks it's a damn fight.
6326000 6328753 - Finish this bum and let's go home.<br />- Right.
6329320 6331470 Stay to the body! To his right!
6331600 6334956 <i>(Stu)</i> Here we go. Round two.<br />Creed predicted he would win in three.
6335080 6338550 Creed got knocked down in the first.<br />He came back at the end.
6338680 6340671 <i>(Bill)</i> Oh, he's working now.
6340800 6343189 Oh, that sharp left! Again, a hard right.
6343320 6345754 He's working Rocky into the corner again.
6345880 6347836 He's got Rocky back in the corner.
6347960 6352317 Pelting him left and right.<br />He's bouncing up against the ring.
6352880 6355713 <i>(Stu)</i> Oh, Balboa's taking<br />a tremendous beating here.
6355840 6360356 - <i>(Bill)</i> Battering him like a punching bag.<br />- <i>(Stu)</i> What's keeping him up?
6367240 6369674 - He says he wants more!<br />- <i>(Bill)</i> He wants more!
6369800 6374157 You folks in front of your television<br />are watching a battle, I tell you that!
6377840 6381515 <i>(Stu)</i> Balboa trying to fight back...<br />Ooh, a tremendous hook!
6381640 6384916 <i>(Bill)</i> The champion is trying<br />to get himself out, but he can't.
6385040 6388396 He is being barraged<br />with lefts and rights to his body!
6388520 6391990 <i>(Stu)</i> Balboa is smacking the champion<br />right on the kisser!
6392120 6394350 <i>- (bell)</i><br />- The referee's stepped in.
6394480 6396710 They're ready to keep going!
6396840 6398956 Back to your corner!
6399080 6401355 Come on, Creed!
6401720 6403790 <i>(Stu)</i> This is gonna be a tough one.
6467680 6469636 <i>(Bill)</i> Hard left and right combination!
6469760 6472718 <i>(Stu)</i> What is keeping him up, Bill?<br />I don't know!
6474920 6478276 He can't even get his gloves up<br />to protect himself!
6484680 6486716 Down! Down! Stay down!
6486840 6489991 <i>(Bill)</i> Apollo dancing around<br />with his arms in the air!
6499520 6501715 Five!
6501840 6504195 Six! Seven!
6504880 6506950 Eight! Nine!
6512000 6514355 OK, OK. Come on!
6516400 6518994 <i>(Bill)</i> Apollo can't believe it!
6531320 6533276 <i>(bell)</i>
6533960 6537748 <i>(Stu)</i> The champion got a left to the ribs,<br />his right ribs.
6545440 6548193 - You OK, champ?<br />- Yeah, I'm OK, I'm OK.
6550520 6553796 I can't see nothin'.<br />I gotta open my eye. Cut me, Mick.
6553920 6557276 - You don't wanna do it.<br />- Go on, cut me. Cut me.
6564400 6570032 - You're bleeding inside. I'm gonna stop it.<br />- You ain't stoppin' nothin', man.
