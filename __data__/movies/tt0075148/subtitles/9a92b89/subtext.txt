1514764 1519886 there was one girl in the neighbourhood<br />who talked like that, you know? Just one.
1520006 1522804 What you doin'?<br />That'll make your teeth yellow.
1522926 1525760 - l like yellow teeth.<br />- And your breath like garbage.
1525887 1528721 - Maybe l like garbage.<br />- C'mon, nobody likes garbage.
1528848 1533604 Anyway, this girl wasn't bad-looking,<br />but guys never took her serious, you see?
1533730 1535960 - They never took her out for a date.<br />- Why?
1536090 1539128 Guys laugh when you talk dirty.<br />They think you're cute.
1539251 1542562 lf you get a reputation,<br />you get no respect, you understand?
1542692 1546129 You get no respect.<br />l gotta use a bad word.
1546253 1548529 Whore. You understand? Whore.
1548654 1552648 You see, if you use dirty words,<br />you maybe end up becomin' a whore.
1553175 1556725 - Come on, Rocky. l'm 1 2.<br />- Hey, that don't matter you're 1 2.
1556856 1561772 You don't really have to be one.<br />You just act like one, and that's it - boom!
1561898 1563854 You get a bad rep, you understand?
1563978 1567767 20 years from now, people are<br />gonna say ''Do you remember Marie?''
1567899 1571688 ''No, who was she?'' ''The whore that<br />hung down at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.''
1571820 1574381 ''Oh, yeah. Now l remember her.''
1574501 1579975 You see, they don't remember you.<br />They remember the rep, you understand?
1580103 1581934 Hey, you got a boyfriend?
1582063 1585022 No, you ain't got a boyfriend.<br />You know why?
1585144 1588899 Why don't you? Because you hang out<br />with them coconuts on the corner.
1589025 1592382 You hang around with coconuts,<br />you get nowhere. They're lemons!
1592506 1595226 Hang out with nice people,<br />you get nice friends.
1595347 1597987 Hang out with smart people,<br />you get smart friends.
1598108 1600907 Hang out with yo-yo people,<br />you get yo-yo friends.
1601029 1604466 lt's simple mathematics.<br />l hope you ain't gonna...
1604590 1606148 - l won't.<br />- What was l gonna say?
1606270 1609308 You hope l stop actin'<br />like a whore or l'll turn into one.
1609431 1611582 - Somethin' like that.<br />- Night, Rocky.
1611712 1613942 - Night, Marie. Take care.<br />- Hey, Rocky.
1614072 1616462 - Yo?<br />- Screw you, creepo!
1624075 1627830 Yeah, who are you to give advice,<br />creepo? Who are you?
1646242 1649439 - Are the doctor's reports confirmed?<br />- Definitely.
1649562 1655241 lt says that Green has suffered a severely<br />cracked third metacarpal in his left hand.
1656725 1660560 We can cancel the fight indefinitely<br />if you're set on fighting Green.
1660686 1664965 Hey, it ain't just Green! What about<br />all the time Apollo has invested?
1665087 1667886 - l believe we can find a solution.<br />- Solution nothin'.
1668008 1670602 Find me another contender<br />in a flash, Jergens.
1670728 1675167 Don't play games with my client. He's<br />done a million dollars' worth of publicity
1675290 1678010 and has made contractual obligations.
1678131 1682091 - He's not going to be embarrassed!<br />- l contacted Ernie Roman's manager.
1682212 1686126 - Ernie is fighting in France that week.<br />- Buddy Shaw. He's ranked fifth.
1686253 1691282 Went to California and gained 50 pounds.<br />l got hold of every worthwhile contender
1691414 1695169 and they all say five weeks<br />isn't enough time to get into shape.
1695295 1699654 Shape nothin', man! They afraid! They<br />know everybody's gonna see the fight.
1699777 1702371 None of 'em can whip me.<br />They're makin' excuses
1702498 1705570 so they don't get whipped<br />in front of the whole world.
1705698 1708532 All l can say is l'm a good promoter.
1708659 1711891 l've promoted fights in every<br />goddamn country in the world
1712020 1716777 and l've broken my ass over this,<br />but l don't know what the hell else to do.
1721503 1723380 l do.
1724824 1728977 Without a ranked contender, what<br />this fight is gonna need is a novelty.
1729105 1731381 This is the land of opportunity, right?
1731506 1737377 So Apollo Creed on January 1 gives<br />a local underdog fighter an opportunity.
1737507 1741661 A snow-white underdog. And l'm gonna<br />put his face on this poster with me.
1741789 1743381 And l'll tell you why.
1743509 1748187 Because l'm sentimental, like<br />a lot of other people in this country.
1748311 1752510 There's nothing they'd like better than<br />to see Apollo Creed give a local boy
1752632 1756421 a shot at the world title<br />on this country's biggest birthday.
1756553 1758943 Now that's the way l see it.
1759074 1761110 And that's the way it's gonna be.
1761234 1763226 Apollo, l like it!
1763355 1765664 lt's very American.
1765796 1768549 No, Jergens. lt's very smart.
1792163 1794473 - What is it?<br />- l just wanna check this out.
1794604 1797881 l pick up two yards from Snyder<br />and a grand from Cappoli?
1798005 1801840 No, no. Two yards from Cappoli<br />and a grand from Snyder.
1801966 1805198 - Two yards. Yeah, l got it.<br />- OK, write it down, OK?
1805327 1808798 Who's this girl you're<br />goin' out with tomorrow night?
1808928 1811887 - How d'you know?<br />- Don't you think l hear things?
1812009 1816481 - A lot of canaries flyin' around the docks.<br />- l'm goin' out with Paulie's sister.
1816610 1820240 - l hear she's retarded.<br />- She ain't retarded. She's shy, you know?
1820371 1824888 l'll tell you what to do. Take her<br />to the zoo. l hear retards like the zoo.
1825012 1827368 - This bum gotta say that?<br />- You callin' me a bum?
1827493 1830645 - l'm callin' you a bum!<br />- OK, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood.
1830774 1833130 - lt's his prostate.<br />- He's always in a bad mood.
1833255 1836532 Count your blessings, Buddy.<br />You're still healthy.
1836656 1838886 - l don't like your face.<br />- l don't like yours!
1839016 1840814 - Kiss my ass!<br />- Move!
1840937 1845887 Relax! Relax! Relax! My ears! What,<br />are you drivin' me crazy? Both of ya's.
1847579 1851937 Buddy doesn't like ya. Some guys,<br />they just hate for no reason, you got me?
1852060 1854017 - Yeah.<br />- Come here.
1855061 1858054 There's 50 bucks.<br />You and Adrian, you have a nice time.
1858182 1860298 Thanks.
1860743 1864783 - Hey, how'd you know her name?<br />- You don't think l hear things?
1865384 1868263 - Remember what l told you.<br />- What'd you tell me?
1868385 1870535 Take her to the zoo!
1877387 1881142 - Some more coffee, Mr Creed?<br />- No thanks, Shirley.
1881268 1884227 - What do you think about Billy Snow?<br />- Fouls.
1885390 1887346 - How about Big Chuck Smith?<br />- Yeah.
1887470 1891180 No, he's too old and dull.<br />Hey, that Bobby Judge, he's a good boy.
1891311 1896228 - No, l don't feel the heat from that name.<br />- Joe Zack's a good prospect.
1896353 1899630 Exactly what are you lookin' for, Apollo?
1900274 1904154 This is what l'm lookin' for.<br />The ltalian Stallion.
1905035 1907391 Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.
1907516 1909746 Look, it's the name, man.
1909877 1912516 The ltalian Stallion.
1912637 1917190 The media'll eat it up. Now who<br />discovered America? An ltalian, right?
1917319 1920630 What would be better than<br />to get it on with a descendant?
1920760 1923832 He's a southpaw.<br />l don't want you messin' with them.
1923961 1928717 - They do everything backwards.<br />- Southpaw nothin'! l'll drop him in three.
1928842 1932836 ''Apollo Creed meets the ltalian Stallion.''
1934323 1936235 Sounds like a damn monster movie!
1936524 1940040 What are you doin' with that bat?<br />l used to be deadly at stickball.
1940165 1945321 - You sure your sister knows l'm comin'?<br />- Very excited. Look at my swollen hands.
1945447 1948645 The joints, from carrying meat<br />in and out of freezers.
1948768 1951840 - Plays hell on the joints.<br />- Maybe you oughta see a doctor.
1951968 1954437 l don't need a doctor.<br />l need a different job.
1954569 1957721 - What kind of turkey? Big or small?<br />- Talk to Gazzo about me.
1957850 1961241 Tell him l'm a good man<br />and nothin' bothers me.
1961371 1964921 l'd make a great collector.<br />Bustin' bones don't bother me.
1965052 1969764 A big turkey, right? Hey, forget Gazzo.<br />That's a bad job, you know what l mean?
1969894 1973251 - You got a match?<br />- Go to him for me, as a favour.
1973375 1976094 Yeah, yeah. Last time l had a turkey,
1976215 1981814 it was when they had a $2 special<br />at Horn & Hardart's about three years ago.
1989819 1994815 - Your sister knows l'm comin', for sure?<br />- Yeah, she's gonna be excited.
1996981 1999735 Hey, will you forget about Gazzo, huh?
1999862 2003094 - l don't ask nobody twice.<br />- You don't ask nobody twice.
2003223 2005977 Stay away, baby
2007784 2013383 - You sure your sister knows l'm comin'?<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very excited.
2015907 2018501 Paulie! You're late.
2018627 2023578 You called the hospital? She calls<br />the hospital if l'm ten minutes late.
2023709 2025860 Yo, how you doin'?
2025990 2028345 l told you she's very excited.
2031031 2033307 Why didn't you say<br />you were bringin' him?
2033432 2036869 - Look at me. l'm not ready.<br />- Would it make a difference if you were?
2036993 2040669 - He's a friend and he's takin' you out.<br />- No, l can't.
2040794 2044344 l want you outta the kitchen<br />and l want you out right now.
2044475 2046830 l won't.
2046956 2049629 Hey! Hey!
2050276 2052666 Hey, l want you outta here instamatically!
2052797 2057474 l'm sick of seein' you hangin' around<br />like a spider! Go out and live! Enjoy life!
2057599 2061036 - Paulie, l can't go!<br />- Don't get wise with me now.
2061160 2064870 - l'm tired of you bein' a loser.<br />- Don't call me that, Paulie!
2065001 2067799 <i>Apollo Creed is shopping<br />for another ''victim''</i>
2067921 2071632 <i>to fill Green's vacancy for the<br />Bicentennial championship fight...</i>
2071763 2074277 You didn't tell me<br />you were bringin' him home!
2074403 2077441 l'm not gonna go, Paulie!<br />l can't go! l won't go!
2077564 2079476 Why?
2079605 2083394 Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.<br />l got a turkey in the oven.
2083526 2086360 Oh. A turkey in the oven?
2100371 2102202 You want the bird?
2102331 2104448 Go in the alley and eat the bird!
2104572 2106803 Oh, Paulie!

2116535 2118891 You hungry, Rock?
2124378 2128054 Hey, yo, Paulie. Maybe we'd just<br />better forget all this, you know?
2128179 2131331 - Just forget it.<br />- Forget nothin'. Say somethin' funny.
2131460 2134577 Ain't nothin' to say.<br />She's in a bad mood, l'm in a bad mood...
2134700 2137261 You know how to do funny.<br />Wanna go out with her?
2137381 2139737 - Yeah.<br />- Well...
2142863 2145424 - l don't know what to say.<br />- Funny.
2156867 2159301 Yo, Adrian. lt's me, Rocky.
2159427 2161419 Rocky, you know?
2161548 2163505 Listen...
2164989 2169268 l dunno what to say, cos l ain't never<br />talked to no door before, you know?
2170311 2174544 - l mean, what do l say to a door? Listen...<br />- Come on, you're doin' fine.
2174672 2176902 l ain't doin' fine. l look like an idiot.
2177033 2181186 Keep doin' what you're doin'.<br />Funny. l know all about these things.
2181314 2183270 l feel like a jerk.
2188916 2191272 Yo, Adrian. lt's Rocky again, you know?
2191397 2193467 Listen...
2193597 2196158 l know you ain't too happy<br />at this moment.
2196278 2200716 Well, could you do me a favour? l ain't<br />got nobody to spend Thanksgiving with.
2200839 2205710 So how about maybe you and l could<br />go out together and get somethin' to eat?
2205841 2208514 l don't know, maybe laugh<br />a little bit. Who knows?
2208641 2210997 Would you like to...
2211962 2216913 l don't know. Would you like to maybe,<br />you know, you and me go out together?
2221965 2224434 We're gonna have a good time.
2224566 2227957 We'll have a real good time, you know?
2231088 2233444 Thanks for the bird.
2236169 2239128 l'm gonna turn the TV off.<br />l got a headache.
2250854 2253129 - What's your sister like to do?<br />- lce-skate.
2253254 2258205 Adrian, come on, you're lettin' the heat<br />out. Who pays the bills around here?
2262697 2266247 Listen, l don't want<br />no turkey anyway, you know?
2267298 2270848 - But it was Thanksgiving.<br />- lt was what?
2270979 2275132 - lt was Thanksgiving.<br />- Yeah, to you, but to me it's Thursday.
2298747 2301216 - Yo, looks kinda quiet.<br />- l think it's closed.
2301348 2304386 No, l think we're just early<br />or somethin' like that.
2304509 2305703 - Yo!<br />- Yo!
2305829 2307741 - We're closed!<br />- What?
2307870 2310589 - l said we're closed!<br />- Yeah. Hey, listen,
2310711 2313862 l'm gonna smooth this guy out.<br />Wait here for a few minutes.
2313991 2316187 - We could go someplace else.<br />- No, it's OK.
2316312 2319623 Are you closed to the general public<br />or closed to everybody?
2319753 2324066 lt's after six o'clock. lt's Thanksgiving.<br />That's why there's nobody here.
2324194 2328314 Besides, you ain't supposed to be in here,<br />so do me a favour and leave, huh?
2328436 2332225 - Could you do me a favour?<br />- Hey, come on, we're not operatin'.
2332357 2334996 Look, this girl here ain't feelin' well.
2335117 2339556 The doctor says she should exercise<br />and ice-skating's the best thing.
2339679 2343878 - Yeah? So what do you want from me?<br />- Do me a favour. She ain't feelin' good.
2344000 2347357 So if you could let her on the ice,<br />l'd appreciate it.
2347481 2351270 - Ten minutes, ten bucks.<br />- Ten bucks? How about eight bucks?
2351402 2353633 Come on! lt's Thanksgiving.
2353763 2358713 - All right. Nine bucks, you got a deal.<br />- You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.
2360365 2361923 Gimme the blades.
2362805 2365798 - Aren't you skating?<br />- No, l ain't skated since l was 1 5.
2365926 2368236 That's when l started fightin'.
2368367 2371838 - Skating's bad for the ankles, you know?<br />- Yeah.
2371968 2374529 You're a pretty good skater, ain't ya?
2375449 2380683 Like l was sayin' on the way over, fightin'<br />used to be tops with me, but no more.
2380810 2383325 All l wanted to do was<br />prove l was no bum,
2383451 2385761 that l had the stuff to make a good pro.
2385892 2389363 - You never got the chance?<br />- l ain't cryin', cos l still fight.
2389493 2392850 l kinda do it like a hobby.<br />The trouble is, l'm a southpaw.
2392974 2395853 - What's a southpaw?<br />- lt means you're left-handed.
2395975 2398205 A southpaw throws your timin' off, see?
2398335 2402125 Other guys, it makes 'em look awkward.<br />Nobody wants to look awkward.
2402257 2405694 - You know where southpaw came from?<br />- Nine minutes!
2405818 2409607 A long time ago, a couple of hundred<br />years ago, this guy was fightin'.
2409739 2413050 l think it was around Philadelphia.<br />He was left-handed.
2413180 2415489 His arm was facin' towards New Jersey.
2415620 2418738 And that's south,<br />so they called him Southpaw.
2418861 2421456 You see? Southpaw, South Jersey,
2421582 2424700 South Camden, Southpaw...<br />You know what l mean?
2426263 2428255 Things worked out for the best.
2428384 2430899 You never got a chance,<br />being left-handed?
2431025 2434575 Well, that's absolutely true,<br />you know? Watch out, watch out.
2437667 2440865 l just dislocated my finger.<br />Agh! Look at that.
2440988 2443297 No, hey, wait! lt ain't your fault. Look.
2443428 2446341 See? Look.<br />lt's an old wound. You see that?
2446469 2450145 Look. See? Nothin'.<br />lt bends like that. l originally done it...
2450270 2452227 Push the button... Bong! lt works.
2452351 2455708 - lt ain't your fault. l'll show you...<br />- Seven minutes!
2455832 2458745 l originally done it...<br />l keep pictures of all my fights.
2458873 2461307 l done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. See?
2461593 2464427 He's the size of an airplane.<br />l broke both my hands.
2464554 2470392 l lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,<br />don't you think? See how it works there?
2470516 2472508 Come on. Are you havin' a good time?
2472637 2476551 l'll tell ya, you can see l ain't<br />too graceful. l don't move well.
2476678 2479591 But l can really swat, you know?<br />l can really hit hard.
2479719 2484669 But l'm a southpaw and nobody wants to<br />fight a southpaw, you know what l mean?
2487041 2490717 Whooo! You know how<br />l got started in fightin'?
2490842 2492798 - Huh?<br />- No.
2492922 2494914 Am l talkin' too loud?

2496523 2500882 My father, he's...<br />My old man, he was never too smart.
2501005 2505443 He says to me ''You weren't born<br />much of a brain, so start usin' your body.''
2505566 2507922 So l've become a fighter.
2508047 2511404 You know what l mean?<br />Why are you laughin'?
2512768 2515488 My mother, she said the opposite thing.
2515609 2518249 What did she say?<br />What did she say, the opposite?
2518370 2522364 ''You weren't born much of a body,<br />so you'd better develop your brain.''
2522491 2525529 - Did she say that?<br />- Yo! Time!
2526332 2529131 - Can l ask you a question?<br />- Absolutely.
2530373 2533332 - Why do you wanna fight?<br />- Cos l can't sing or dance.

2599393 2603069 l don't understand why anybody<br />would wanna be a fighter.
2603194 2605230 Hey, you gotta be a moron.
2605354 2608711 You gotta be a moron to wanna be<br />a fighter, you know what l mean?
2608835 2612146 lt's a racket where you're almost<br />guaranteed to end up a bum.
2612276 2615667 - l don't think you're a bum.<br />- l'm at least half a bum, you know?
2615797 2618517 l'll tell ya somethin'.

3119221 3121940 And instead of that,<br />you became a leg-breaker
3122061 3125099 to some cheap, second-rate loan shark!
3125222 3128135 - lt's a livin'.<br />- lt's a waste of life!
3146148 3148299 Yes? May l help you?
3152990 3155221 Oh! You must be Mr Rocky Balboa.

3188280 3192672 Rocky. Tell me, Rocky. You got any<br />representation? You have a manager?
3192801 3194758 Uh, no, just me.
3195882 3199432 Rocky, l've got a proposition<br />l'd like to make to you.
3199563 3202795 - About sparrin'?<br />- l beg your pardon?
3202924 3207283 l know you're lookin' for sparrin' partners<br />and l wanna say l'm very available.
3207406 3210604 - l'm sure you are.<br />- Absolutely. lt would be an honour.
3210727 3213685 And you know what?<br />l wouldn't take no cheap shots.
3213807 3218599 - l'd really be a good sparrin' partner.<br />- You don't understand me, Rocky.
3218729 3223599 My proposition's this. Would you be<br />interested in fighting Apollo Creed
3223730 3226484 for the world heavyweight championship?
3230812 3233168 - No.<br />- Listen, Rocky,
3234413 3236530 Apollo's seen you fight.
3237014 3239973 He likes you. He wants to fight you.
3240095 3243850 Well, it's just that, you see,<br />l fight in clubs, you know?
3243976 3248368 l'm really a ham and egger. This guy is<br />the best. lt wouldn't be such a good fight.
3248497 3252286 But thank you very much,<br />you know? l appreciate it.
3252658 3256892 Rocky, do you believe that America<br />is the land of opportunity?
3258180 3259853 Yeah.
3259981 3261972 Apollo Creed does.
3262101 3266732 And he's gonna prove it to the world<br />by giving an unknown a shot at the title.
3266863 3269582 And that unknown is you.
3269703 3271854 He picked you, Rocky.
3272664 3275782 Rocky, it's the chance of a lifetime.
3275905 3278056 You can't pass it by.
3278946 3281097 What do ya say?
3284988 3288777 <i>All right. That's enough pictures.<br />We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.</i>
3288909 3291343 <i>How do you like<br />the city of brotherly love?</i>
3291470 3294780 <i>Well, just bein' in Philadelphia<br />makes me feel patriotic.</i>
3294910 3298460 <i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city<br />wishin' me the best.</i>
3298592 3301948 <i>l love my Philadelphia brothers.<br />l'm proud to be an American.</i>
3302073 3306625 <i>Apollo, why did you agree to fight a man<br />who has virtually no chance of winning?</i>
3306754 3308870 <i>Look, if history proves one thing...</i>
3308994 3312510 <i>American history proves that<br />everybody's got a chance to win.</i>
3312636 3316107 <i>Didn't you guys ever hear of<br />Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>
3316237 3319309 <i>lt is a coincidence that<br />you're fighting a white man</i>
3319437 3321633 <i>on the most celebrated day<br />in US history?</i>
3321758 3327153 <i>l don't know. ls it a coincidence that he's<br />fightin' a black man on the same day?</i>
3327280 3329236 <i>Right on! Tell the truth, brother!</i>
3329360 3331750 <i>How do you feel about your challenger?</i>
3331881 3334840 <i>How do l feel about him?<br />Come here, Rock.</i>
3334962 3338797 <i>- My main man. Rocky, ain't you ltalian?<br />- Yeah, l'm ltalian.</i>
3338923 3343475 <i>- Well now, what does that mean?<br />- lf he can't fight, l bet he can cook!</i>
3345045 3348880 - Do me a favour. His lungs, punch out.<br />- Paulie!
3349006 3352283 <i>Rocky, how do you<br />expect to fight Apollo Creed?</i>
3352407 3356367 <i>Well, jeez, Creed's the best.<br />l guess l'll have to do the best l can.</i>
3356488 3359162 <i>Tell me, Rocky. Just between us,</i>
3359289 3362088 <i>where did you get<br />the name ''ltalian Stallion''?</i>
3362210 3366443 <i>Oh, l invented that about eight years ago<br />when l was eatin' dinner.</i>
3366571 3372443 <i>Rocky, now your payday will be $1 50,000.<br />Any comment?</i>
3374133 3376364 <i>- You got no comment, Rocky, right?<br />- No.</i>
3376494 3378212 <i>No comment, right.</i>
3378334 3381805 <i>Wait a minute. l just wanna<br />say hi to my girlfriend, OK?</i>
3381935 3386054 <i>Yo, Adrian! lt's me, Rocky.<br />Look at this. Can you believe all this?</i>
3386176 3389010 Rocky, you didn't...!
3389137 3391936 <i>- Thank you, Rocky.<br />- Quit pushin', man!</i>
3392058 3393127 <i>Thank you, Rocky.</i>
3393258 3397094 Don't it matter he's makin' you out a fool?<br />l'd break his lips.
3397220 3400257 - He's takin' cheap shots.<br />- lt don't bother me none.
3400380 3405217 Yo, Rock. l guess you'd be lookin'<br />for people to help you out.
3405342 3407903 - Help what?<br />- You know...
3408023 3411699 - Keep you livin' a clean life.<br />- l do OK, you know?
3411824 3415977 You need someone to help with<br />the exercise, stand by with a towel,
3416105 3417743 run errands.
3417865 3422702 Who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.<br />l think l'm gonna train myself, you know?
3422827 3427538 Without such good people around to help,<br />you don't have such a good chance.
3427668 3430467 Einstein flunked outta school. Twice.
3430589 3432785 - That so?<br />- Yeah.
3432910 3438190 Beethoven was deaf, Helen Keller was<br />blind. l think Rocky's got a good chance.
3443953 3447469 - Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?<br />- You lookin' to do a good deed?
3447594 3450314 Keep outta my freakin' life!
3450675 3452631 - What did l do?<br />- Nothin'.
3452755 3455475 - Did l say something?<br />- You didn't say nothin'.
3455596 3459670 That's right, you didn't say nothin'!<br />Nothin' at all!
3461238 3463194 l gotta go.
3463759 3466114 Where's the freakin' pretzels?
3469000 3472550 Goddamn the pretzels!<br />Hey, we don't have any beer!
3515800 3519315 You know how I said that stuff<br />on TV didn't bother me none?

3653081 3655221 Yeah, sure it is.<br />Can I sit down?
3655291 3656405 Yeah, sure.
3657469 3658899 What the hell are those?
3658974 3660633 Oh, those are domestic turtles.
3660703 3663290 The one on the top is Cuff<br />and the other guy's Link.
3663361 3664791 The rest of them are marbles.
3664865 3667006 Yeah? They make good soup,<br />don't they?
3668036 3673310 Anyway, look... I'm here to warn ya<br />that you gotta be very careful
3673384 3676201 about this shot<br />that you got at the title,
3676266 3678821 because, I don't know,<br />like the Bible says...
3678892 3681130 you ain't gonna get<br />a second chance.
3681197 3683108 Yeah. All right.
3683183 3684940 You thought of that, huh?
3685008 3688939 Well, what you need<br />is a manager.
3689011 3691085 A manager.<br />Listen to me.
3691156 3694606 I know because I've been<br />in this racket for 50 years.
3694679 3696022 - 50 years, huh?<br />- 50 years.
3696088 3699287 God, I've seen it all.<br />All of it.
3699354 3701265 - You know what I done?<br />- What?
3701339 3703196 I have done it all.
3703261 3706842 You shoulda seen me when I<br />knocked Giny Russo outta the ring.
3706912 3710809 Outta the goddamn ring.<br />That's, uh, September the 14th, 1923.
3710882 3714878 And it was the same night that Firpo<br />knocks Dempsey outta the ring.
3714949 3717504 The same night. So, who gets<br />the publicity? Figure that out.
3717575 3719169 - Dempsey.<br />- That's right. But why?
3719240 3723367 - 'Cause he was Champ.<br />- No! Because he had a manager.
3723435 3725346 I had nothin', man.
3726061 3728452 I wanna show you somethin'.<br />Look at my face for a minute.
3728526 3731790 Look at this.<br />I got 21 stitches over this left eye.
3731857 3734346 I got 34 stitches over this eye.
3734419 3737869 You know what?<br />I had my nose busted 17 times.
3737941 3741938 The last time was<br />with that fight with Sailor Mike.
3742009 3744945 I got that clip in here.<br />That was a good fight.
3745018 3746296 You wanna read that?
3747100 3749011 You... oh, it doesn't matter.
3749085 3752437 Anyway, he put this vegetation<br />on my ear.
3753504 3756855 Ah, Rocky Marciano.
3757667 3761565 You know, you kinda remind me<br />of the Rock, you know that?
3761638 3762751 You really think so?
3762823 3767168 That's right. You move like him,<br />and you got heart like he did.
3767241 3770856 Yeah, I got heart,<br />but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?
3774159 3775916 Uh... anyway,
3775984 3779183 you know, when I begun<br />in this business, kid...
3780691 3784850 Look, kid, I wanna make a suggestion.<br />Don't drink that piss before a fight.
3784918 3786676 You know, it's no good for you.
3787640 3789551 If you don't mind my sayin'.
3789626 3791482 Anyway, you know,<br />when I started this racket,
3791547 3793621 pugs like us,<br />we was treated like dogs.
3793692 3796083 For ten bucks,<br />you gotta tear somebody's throat out.
3796159 3798975 But I never had no management.<br />You know...
3799585 3802620 One time,<br />this... this son of a bitch that I fought,
3802691 3804601 he put a nail right there.
3804676 3806750 - Thumb.<br />- The thumb, yeah. In the glove.
3806822 3809060 And he punched<br />so many holes in my face.
3809127 3812129 I had the spit<br />shootin' out of my cheeks.
3812266 3813543 Can you imagine that?
3814187 3817702 Anyway, I'll tell ya what I looked like<br />when I was, uh, in my prime.
3817773 3820623 I want you to look at some...<br />will you look at that? Look at that.
3820687 3824585 That's the way I looked...<br />before these guys got at me.
3824659 3828491 That's nice. You take very<br />good care of the picture, though.
3828566 3829843 But I never had...
3829910 3832148 I never had no management...<br />that's the trouble!
3832215 3834453 But now I got all this knowledge.<br />I got it up here.
3834522 3836694 Now I wanna give it to you!
3836763 3838936 I wanna give you this knowledge.<br />I wanna take care of you.
3839004 3842651 I wanna make sure that all this shit that<br />happened to me doesn't happen to you.
3842719 3844149 You know what I mean?
3844960 3846390 The fight's set.
3846466 3848672 Listen to me.<br />I wanna be your manager.
3848740 3852671 - You follow that, do you?<br />- The fight's set. I don't need a manager.
3852742 3854653 But you can't buy<br />what I'm gonna give you.
3854727 3856736 I mean, I've got pain<br />and I've got experience.
3856809 3859462 Well, I got pain<br />and I got experience, too.
3860268 3861578 Listen, kid...
3861644 3863620 - Hey, yo. Hey, Mick.<br />- What?
3863694 3866511 I needed your help about<br />ten years ago, right? Ten years ago?
3866576 3868814 - Right.<br />- You never helped me. You didn't care.
3868881 3870792 Well, if you wanted help...
3870867 3873105 I say, if you wanted help,<br />why didn't you ask?
3873172 3874930 Why didn't you<br />just ask me, kid?
3874998 3877455 <i>Look, I asked,<br />but you never heard nothin'!</i>
3878456 3879668 Well, I...
3881274 3882802 I, uh...
3882876 3886075 I know I...<br />I'm 76 years old.
3890464 3893281 And, uh... well.
3901801 3903231 Where the hell is...
3925850 3927761 Took you long enough to get here.
3928764 3930838 Took you ten years<br />to come to my house?
3930910 3932984 Huh, what's the matter?<br />You don't like my house?
3933759 3935037 Does my house stink?
3936097 3937757 That's right... it stinks!
3937827 3940698 <i>I didn't have no favors from you!</i>
3940772 3942431 <i>Don't slum around me!</i>
3943142 3945446 Talkin' about your prime.
3945512 3947423 What about my prime, Mick?!
3947497 3949254 <i>At least you had a prime!</i>
3950315 3952291 I didn't have no prime.<br />I didn't have nothin'!
3952364 3955236 Leg's are goin', everything is goin',<br />Nobody's gettin' no nothin'.
3955311 3957385 Guy comes up, offers me a fight.<br />Big deal.
3957456 3960043 Wanna fight the fight?<br />Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.
3960114 3963728 <i>I wouldn't wanna fight. Know what's<br />gonna happen to me? I'm gonna get that!</i>
3963797 3965139 I'm gonna get that!
3966710 3969429 And you wanna be ringside<br />to see it? Do ya?
3969496 3970872 You wanna help me out?
3970938 3973493 <i>Huh? Do you wanna see me<br />get my face kicked in?!</i>
3973564 3975321 <i>Legs ain't workin',<br />nothing's workin',</i>
3975389 3977812 <i>but they go.<br />"Go on, fight the champ."</i>
3978303 3979580 Yeah, I'll fight him.
3982402 3984061 Get my face kicked in.
3984963 3987453 And you come around here.<br />You wanna move in here with me?!
3987526 3989382 Come on in!<br />It's a nice house!
3990216 3993087 Real nice.<br />Come on in and move. It stinks!
3994122 3995879 This whole place stinks.
3996652 4000003 <i>You wanna help me out?<br />Well, help me out!</i>
4000079 4002252 <i>Come on, help me out.<br />I'm standin' here!</i>
4059672 4062708 <i>It's only about 28 degrees.<br />We'll check that forecast in just a minute.</i>
4062778 4065912 <i>I feel very mischievous.<br />Very weird. Very...</i>
4066718 4069021 <i>Well, the thing is,<br />I got vinyl seats in my car.</i>
4069087 4072024 <i>When I hit the seats this morning,<br />I just went. "Whew!"</i>
4072097 4074073 <i>I'm thinkin', if I'm up,</i>
4074147 4077183 <i>everybody in the Delaware Valley<br />should be up. Do you agree with me?</i>
4077253 4080451 <i>I mean, at three minutes past 4:00,<br />what else are you gonna do?</i>
4082921 4084678 <i>- Hello?<br />- Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.</i>
4084746 4087301 <i>This is Don Cannon,<br />W-I-B-G Philadelphia.</i>
4087372 4088802 <i>- How are you this morning?<br />- Huh?</i>
4088877 4090154 <i>- Mrs. Kramer?<br />- What?!</i>
4090222 4094698 <i>I think you have a lot of nerve calling me<br />at this hour in the morning! Goodbye!</i>
4095505 4101652 <i>W-I-B-G</i>
4101718 4106959 <i>Philadelphia</i>
4107610 4109783 <i>Me and Mrs. Kramer are up,<br />and it's a good morning.</i>
4109851 4113848 <i>I tell ya, I need someone to snuggle with,<br />28 degrees. It's cold out there.</i>
4113919 4116790 <i>We deserve it. We've been getting away<br />with murder the last couple weeks.</i>
4116865 4119168 <i>Our high today could possibly<br />be 58, and that's it.</i>
4119234 4121625 <i>Tonight we're back down<br />on the 20 degree range,</i>
4121700 4125215 <i>a little colder in the suburbs,<br />and tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,</i>
4125286 4126564 <i>we may hit 40 somewhere.</i>
4126632 4128389 <i>But it's 28, it's awfully chilly.</i>
4128456 4131393 <i>Make sure you have it<br />snuggled on before you bring it out.</i>
4267563 4268840 Come on.
4269644 4272035 Stinks in... hey, come on.<br />It stinks in here, you know.
4272110 4274086 Yeah... I know.
4275761 4277518 Hey, did you kill all these things?
4278483 4280240 No. Across the street.
4282518 4284756 This place is like<br />an animal morgue, you know?
4285432 4287987 - It's a little cold in here, ain't it?<br />- Yeah.
4292701 4294295 Who killed all these things?
4295070 4296500 What, are you crazy, Paulie?
4296575 4298748 If you don't pay Gazzo,<br />you end up on the hook.
4298817 4301055 Come on, Gazzo's a good man.<br />You know that.
4301123 4302880 Hey, don't get excited.<br />I know that.
4302948 4306627 That's why I want you to talk to him<br />about me... the collectin' job.
4306694 4308998 Get me out<br />of this stinkin' freezer.
4309064 4310658 Why don't you do yourself a favor?
4310730 4313449 Why don't you keep this job,<br />because you eat better, you know?
4314669 4316099 Moo.
4316174 4317701 Does it ever snow in here?
4318831 4321386 Uh... you and my sister.
4321457 4323214 How you gettin' along together?
4323859 4324972 How do you think?
4325812 4328945 Well, I'm not sure, Rock.<br />What's the story?
4329015 4330871 About what?
4330936 4333239 What's the story?<br />What's happening?
4333305 4334965 Do you really like her?
4335035 4336312 Sure, I like her.
4338590 4340762 I don't see it.<br />What's the attraction?
4342080 4345432 I don't know.<br />It fills gaps, I guess.
4345506 4348061 - What's gaps?<br />- I don't know. Gaps.
4348132 4351779 She's got gaps, I got gaps.<br />Together, we fill gaps. I don't know.
4353544 4354887 You ballin' her?
4355593 4356608 Hey.
4357226 4359617 Hey, you don't talk dirty<br />about your sister.
4361390 4363333 Are you screwin' my sister?
4365937 4369387 You see? That's why I can't connect<br />you with Gazzo, you know that, Paulie?
4369459 4372942 Because you got a big mouth,<br />you know. You just talk too much.
4373014 4375088 It's gettin' cold in here.<br />I'm going home.
4375159 4377943 Cold in here?!<br />It is cold in here!
4378009 4380083 It stinks in here,<br />and you stink!
4407566 4409640 Hey, you're breakin' the ribs.
4428348 4431700 If you do that to Apollo Creed,<br />they'll put us in jail for murder.
4434145 4436056 I'll see ya tomorrow morning, okay?
4448427 4450665 - I turned the heat up.<br />- Thanks.
4451309 4455305 You know, your brother's a good man,<br />but he's awful pushy, you know?
4464694 4467893 - You want me to rub you down?<br />- No, I'm just... I'm just sore, okay?
4467961 4469391 I'll just... just sit here.
4469466 4471539 - You sure?<br />- Yeah, I'm sure.
4475134 4477372 Hey, come on.<br />No foolin' around, all right?
4478176 4479289 I'm tired.
4480162 4482072 Hey, Adrian,<br />I'm serious now.
4482146 4485498 There's no foolin' around during training,<br />understand? I wanna stay strong.
4486149 4488387 - You're not kiddin'?<br />- No, I ain't kiddin'.
4491753 4493347 - You sure?<br />- Yeah, I'm sure.
4493418 4495656 Listen, why don't you<br />just make the meat, okay?
4498190 4499620 Okay, I'll make the meat.
4522911 4524025 Yo.
4525601 4527675 - It's okay.<br />- I'm sorry.
4528259 4529274 Hey.
4552821 4555059 Right, right.<br />Left, left.
4556791 4558385 Underneath.<br />Come on, underneath.
4559033 4561752 Underneath, underneath,<br />underneath. Come on!
4561819 4563097 Hold it. Hold it.
4563164 4565554 Hold it, Rock, will ya?<br />You drive me crazy.
4565629 4567867 You're so sloppy<br />because you're off balance.
4567936 4570971 Let's try this. Now, take this string.<br />Tie it to both ankles.
4571041 4572798 Leave about two feet of slack.
4572867 4574394 I ain't never had good footwork.
4574467 4576378 Never mind footwork.<br />Now you're all balanced.
4576453 4581246 Marciano had the same problem,<br />and this string cured it.
4581321 4582434 Here's the idea...
4582505 4585923 that if you can move and you can hit<br />without breaking the string,
4585995 4587109 you got balance.
4587181 4589222 You become<br />a very dangerous person.
4589294 4591205 - You follow?<br />- You're lookin' good, Rock.
4591280 4592557 - Thanks.<br />- Let's go.
4592624 4594218 That's it. That's it.<br />Underneath.
4594289 4595817 - Hey, Rock.<br />- What?
4595891 4598194 - How 'bout you give us your autograph?<br />- Get outta here!
4598261 4601077 Don't you ever interrupt me<br />while I'm conducting business.
4601143 4603479 Move your little<br />chicken asses out of here.
4603544 4607703 Listen, kid. You!<br />You lay off that pet shop dame.
4607772 4610294 Women weaken legs.
4611262 4613435 Yeah, but I really like<br />this girl, you know?
4613503 4615260 Then let her train ya!
4617954 4621372 - Okay, no more foolin' around.<br />- Okay. Now hit it.
4623014 4625187 Women weaken legs, huh?
4629515 4631272 - Yo, Rock.<br />- Yo, Rocky.
4637713 4638728 Yo.
4640178 4641194 Yo.
4641267 4642893 Yo, you look great.
4643700 4645458 - Really?<br />- Oh, yeah.
4645526 4648495 Terrific. I mean,<br />you could be a heartbreaker.
4648568 4650162 You'll walk down the street<br />breaking hearts,
4650233 4652209 the way you're lookin'...<br />very sharp.
4652282 4654618 I got... I got another surprise for you.
4654684 4655798 What?
4656606 4661049 Hey, Butkus! Hey, Butkus!<br />Come here, kid! Come here!
4661121 4662683 To keep you company<br />when you run.
4668038 4670855 Come on in and meet the family.<br />The owner ever come back?
4670920 4673922 - He's yours. He's yours if you want him.<br />- Do I want him? Come here!
4673994 4675751 What's he eat... this dog?
4675819 4678538 - He eats little turtles.<br />- Yo, Butkus!
4701181 4704926 What's that, Butkus, huh?<br />Whose truck is this? Come on.
4707074 4709312 One call from me,<br />you're a celebrity.
4711588 4714405 - You're gonna need exposure.<br />- Oh, don't breathe on me, Paulie!
4714470 4716861 That's the big time!<br />Don't I know about these things?
4716937 4719077 You don't know nothin'!<br />What do these guys want from me?
4719146 4720740 To watch you train! Boom.
4720811 4723366 What is the matter with you, Paulie?<br />This was supposed to be private.
4723437 4725926 - I'm doin' you a favor!<br />- You ain't doin' me no favors!
4725998 4727592 You're embarrassin' me<br />in front of everybody,
4727664 4729968 you make me look bad<br />in front of your sister...
4730034 4733713 You see this cigar? I'll stick it<br />in your ear. Don't do these things to me!
4733781 4736171 You should've called me up<br />or something... leave a message.
4736246 4737840 Don't do that!
4737911 4739571 My sister really likes you.
4741273 4743828 I'm gonna kill you one of these days,<br />I swear to God!
4743899 4744914 Come on. Come on.
4744988 4747030 - Baby!<br />- Baby.
4747102 4750682 Here he is, the next<br />heavyweight champ, Rocky Balboa!
4750752 4752182 Hi, there. Rocky Balboa.
4752257 4754747 Listen, we wanna get a brief interview<br />with you. It won't take long.
4754819 4756161 - What about me?<br />- What about you?
4756228 4758619 - I'm in charge of the meat.<br />- Fine. Will you stand behind it, please?
4758694 4760768 Listen, just settle yourself in.<br />Just relax.
4760839 4763558 What we're going to do is<br />just ask you a few questions, Rocky.
4763625 4766016 Just a few questions<br />about your unique training method.
4766091 4767369 Talk to the folks at home.
4767436 4769510 They really wanna know<br />how you got into this.
4769582 4771241 I mean, this isn't an everyday thing.
4771310 4772740 Jimmy, you guys ready?<br />Let's roll.
4772816 4774573 Rocky, why don't you turn<br />right around here.
4774641 4776551 Just don't take no cheap shots,<br />you know?
4776626 4778537 No, I won't do that.<br />Just relax, Rocky.
4778612 4781811 Today we're here with<br />heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.
4781878 4785077 - The reason we're standing...<br />- The meat guy's stickin' his face in.
4786169 4788243 Let's try it again, Rocky.
4788315 4791994 <i>Today we're here with<br />heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.</i>
4792061 4794365 <i>The reason we're standing<br />in this refrigerated box</i>
4794431 4797564 <i>is that Mr. Balboa has<br />an unusual method of training.</i>
4797634 4799391 <i>In a moment,<br />he's going to demonstrate that</i>
4799459 4801053 <i>for the viewing audience at home.</i>
4801124 4804956 <i>But first, Rocky, how did you<br />come to train in an icebox?</i>
4805030 4807333 <i>Uh, well, my friend...<br />the guy over there...</i>
4807401 4810337 <i>let me in one day and I hit<br />the beef here and kinda liked it.</i>
4810410 4813926 <i>And since I become a challenger,<br />the owner don't mind that I come in.</i>
4813997 4817894 <i>Is this a common training method?<br />Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i>
4817968 4819725 <i>No, I think I invented it.</i>
4819793 4822991 Don't forget to confirm the reservation<br />for my people at ringside,
4823059 4825101 and be sure<br />to fly my barber to Philly.
4829144 4831863 How much is being channeled into<br />West Coast closed circuit advertising?
4831929 4834232 - $300,000.<br />- Make it 450.
4834300 4836374 And send the mayor's wife<br />200 roses from me,
4836445 4839381 and make sure we get a picture<br />of it for all the newspapers.
4839455 4842174 Do you wanna run<br />the 15 radio spots in the Midwest?
4842240 4845057 I think you could spend your money<br />better in Canadian publicity.
4845122 4847360 By the way... I've got<br />a couple of friends up in Toronto
4847429 4849437 who'd probably be able<br />to get you a good tax break.
4849510 4852130 George, I like your friends.
4859245 4860740 Hey, Champ...
4860814 4863303 you oughta come look at this boy<br />you're gonna fight on TV.
4864177 4865454 Looks like he means business.
4865521 4867115 Yeah, I mean business, too.
4867667 4869424 Shirley, we got<br />any more coffee out there?
4869492 4871796 Oh, certainly, Mr. Creed.<br />I'll get you some right away.
4871862 4874231 After the fight, I may just retire<br />and run for emperor.
4875000 4876856 The arena's<br />the only program concession,
4876922 4880754 and the gross rental of the arena<br />is gonna include the 400 ushers, right?
4888961 4893984 Diana Lewis, in the meat house<br />with southpaw Rocky Balboa.
4938757 4940220 And he called the reporters?
4940294 4942783 Yeah, it threw<br />my whole training schedule off.
4942856 4945062 Don't be mad at him.<br />He's just trying to help.
4945130 4948001 Adrian, I ain't mad,<br />it's just that, uh,
4948075 4950149 when a reporter's around,<br />I get out of joint
4950221 4952776 'cause they take cheap shots,<br />and Paulie knows that.
4953424 4956208 Paulie keeps askin' me<br />for a job all the time,
4956273 4959177 but he don't know nothin'<br />about fightin'.
4959251 4960910 Are you gonna say<br />anything to him?
4962293 4965394 What's to say? I just don't know<br />what he wants from me.
4967801 4969712 I don't want nothin' from you.
4970683 4972473 I don't want nothin' from you.
4973630 4976053 This ain't no charity case.
4976128 4977558 Get outta my house.
4977633 4979325 It's not just your house.
4980194 4981788 You ain't no friend no more.
4982596 4985697 - Get out of my house, I just says.<br />- Don't talk to him like that.
4985766 4988157 Both of you get out of my house.
4988232 4989694 Yo.
4989769 4992040 It's cold outside, Paulie.
5001297 5003371 I don't want you messin' her,
5003442 5006062 and I don't raise you<br />to go with this scum bum!
5006132 5007824 Come on! Wanna hit on me?<br />Come on!
5007893 5010765 I'll break both your arms<br />so they don't work for ya!
5014330 5016721 That's right! I'm not good enough<br />to meet with Gazzo...
5016796 5017909 That's what I think of Gazzo!
5017981 5020284 Now you're a big-shot fighter<br />on your way up,
5020351 5022425 you don't even throw a crumb<br />to your friend Paulie!
5022496 5024668 When I go<br />and get you meat every morning!
5024738 5027292 You forgot that!<br />Then I even give you my sister, too!
5027363 5030399 - Only a pig would say that!<br />- I'm a pig?
5030470 5032129 A pig gives you the best?
5033096 5035650 You're such a loser!<br />I don't get married because of you!
5036810 5038950 You can't live by yourself!
5039020 5042371 I put you two together!<br />And you... don't you forget it!
5042446 5043876 You owe me!
5046385 5048459 - You owe me!<br />- What do I owe you?!
5048531 5050921 You're supposed<br />to be good to me.
5050996 5054195 What do I owe you, Paulie?!<br />What do I owe ya?!
5054262 5055856 I treat you good!
5055927 5059225 I cook for you, I clean for you,<br />I pick up your dirty clothes!
5059290 5063122 I take care of you, Paulie!<br />I don't owe you nothin'!
5063196 5065751 And you made me feel<br />like a loser!
5066623 5068381 I'm not a loser!
5068449 5070687 - You're busted!<br />- What?!
5070754 5072031 You're not a virgin!
5072579 5075931 You let him into your pants!<br />She's busted!
5079273 5081129 I can't haul meat no more!
5110398 5111828 You want a roommate?
5116675 5118105 Absolutely.
5119909 5122245 Okay, now, when you<br />walk into the ring
5122310 5124701 with the number one<br />heavyweight of the world,
5124777 5126305 you'll be ready, won't ya?
5126377 5131334 Why? Because I waited<br />for 50 years to make you ready.
5131404 5134123 You'll be able to spit nails, kid.
5134191 5136264 Like the guy says,<br />you're gonna eat lightning
5136336 5138193 and you're gonna crap thunder.
5138258 5141129 You're gonna become<br />a very dangerous person.
5141204 5143278 - Yo, Mickey.<br />- Hey! How are ya?
5143349 5147575 Oh, Rock. I want you to meet<br />our cutman here, Al Salvani.
5147640 5149551 - Take a look at his eye.<br />- How're you doin'?

5467546 5470931 Rocky.<br />What brings you here tonight?
5471965 5474334 Mr. Jergens,<br />the poster's wrong.
5474399 5475677 What do you mean?
5475744 5478942 Well, I'm wearin' white pants<br />with a red stripe.
5482757 5484995 It doesn't really matter,<br />does it?
5485063 5487333 I'm sure you're gonna give us<br />a great show.
5488841 5490752 Try to get some rest, kid.
5491627 5492838 Good night.
5580874 5582402 I can't do it.
5585198 5586311 What?
5587311 5588905 I can't beat him.
5590321 5591532 Apollo?
5592402 5593516 Yeah.
5594740 5597776 I've been out there<br />walkin' around, thinkin'.
5599448 5602712 I mean, who am I kiddin'?<br />I ain't even in the guy's league.
5607837 5609115 What are we gonna do?
5620358 5621701 I don't know.
5628075 5629669 You worked so hard.
5631534 5634885 It don't matter,<br />'cause I was nobody before.
5636881 5638126 Don't say that.
5638996 5641299 Oh, come on, Adrian.<br />It's true.
5641365 5642959 I was nobody.
5644631 5646705 But it don't matter either,<br />you know?
5648378 5649906 So, I was thinkin'...
5651324 5654043 It really don't matter<br />if I lose this fight.
5655871 5658907 It really don't matter<br />if this guy opens my head, either.
5660802 5663357 'Cause all I wanna do<br />is go the distance.
5667879 5670369 Nobody's ever<br />gone the distance with Creed.
5671690 5673928 And if I can go that distance...
5675181 5678282 ...see, if that bell rings<br />and I'm still standin'...
5683027 5686607 ...I'm gonna know<br />for the first time in my life, you see...
5688343 5691607 ...that I weren't just another bum<br />from the neighborhood.
5756230 5758206 Time, kid.<br />Let's go.
5760842 5762119 I'll wait for you here.
5764812 5767203 Or how 'bout I wait here<br />and you fight, huh?
5768367 5770757 You're lookin' very great today...<br />you know that?
5773298 5776496 I gotta go now, but, uh,<br />don't you leave town, huh?
5777621 5779532 Wish me luck.<br />I'm gonna need it.
5780664 5782094 Good luck.
5782648 5785684 Say, Adrian, you don't think<br />this robe is too baggy, huh?
5786203 5787218 Good luck.
5787292 5788570 Don't leave town.
5791359 5794907 <i>I'd like to have you meet my colleague<br />workin' the fight with me... Stu Hansen.</i>
5794978 5795993 Thank you, Bill Baldwin.
5796066 5799068 The electricity is all over<br />the place tonight as Rocky Balboa...
5800645 5802239 Hey, what the hell is that?
5802311 5804614 I trained you to be a fighter,<br />not a billboard.
5804681 5807399 - I'm doin' it for a friend.<br />- What do you get out of it?
5807467 5809443 Paulie gets three grand,<br />I get the robe.
5809516 5810629 Shrewd.
5811309 5813613 The story about tonight's fight,<br />their difference in style,
5813679 5815753 you can quote a recent<br />sports magazine which said,
5815824 5817898 "Could be the caveman<br />against the cavalier."
5817970 5820273 I noticed a buzzing<br />in the background now, Bill.
5820339 5822577 <i>Could be the challengers<br />getting ready to get into the ring.</i>
5822645 5825843 Rocky! Look at my date.<br />Cost me $200.
5825911 5828302 - 250.<br />- I gotta go. I gotta work.
5828377 5830288 - How's the robe?<br />- It's a little baggy.
5830842 5833561 <i>A 50 to 1 underdog<br />living a Cinderella story,</i>
5833629 5836893 <i>and he's captured people's<br />imaginations all over the world.</i>
5841443 5842970 We love you, Rocky!
5843043 5845980 - Good luck, champ.<br />- Hey, thanks for showin' up.
5846598 5848355 <i>And his record... 44 victories.</i>
5848424 5851295 <i>He's got 38 by knockout,<br />and he's lost 20 fights.</i>
5851369 5853542 <i>Which makes me wonder,<br />can he stand it...</i>
5853611 5855914 <i>the stamina and the skill<br />to last the three rounds?</i>
5855980 5858153 <i>Because Las Vegas odds say no.</i>
5858222 5861486 <i>Rocky Balboa<br />climbing into the ring now.</i>
5861552 5863147 The Italian Stallion.
5863218 5865390 <i>Some meat sign<br />on the back of his robe there.</i>
5865460 5868014 <i>Have you seen what that was?<br />Shamrock Meats, Inc.</i>
5868821 5872501 <i>A lot of noise coming from the back.<br />You could go deaf with that noise.</i>
5872568 5874195 <i>You have the spotlights.</i>
5875323 5878358 <i>Is that the world<br />heavyweight champion Apollo Creed?</i>
5878428 5880819 <i>He's in a boat... riding in a boat.</i>
5880894 5882553 <i>Is he supposed<br />to be George Washington?</i>
5882623 5885659 <i>Obviously so. He's got the hat on,<br />the whole thing. Look at that.</i>
5885730 5887160 <i>It's been confirmed.</i>
5887235 5888992 <i>The world champion Apollo Creed</i>
5889060 5891779 <i>is doing an imitation<br />of George Washington.</i>
5893447 5895041 <i>- He's throwing money.<br />- I don't believe it.</i>
5895112 5898343 <i>Remember we were talking about<br />George Washington throwing the dollar?</i>
5898410 5899491 <i>Throwing the dollar.</i>
5899563 5902500 <i>'Course, if you threw a dollar<br />in those days, it went a lot farther.</i>
5902574 5904168 <i>Oh, he's taking his...</i>
5904239 5906412 <i>White wig came off,<br />the hat came off.</i>
5910579 5913134 <i>And the crowd is loving<br />every minute of it... look at that.</i>

5915030 5916886 Apollo Creed...<br />for you around the world
5916951 5920052 he was dressed as George Washington,<br />the father of our country.
5920121 5921551 I want you!
5925501 5927739 <i>Oh! Look at that!<br />Uncle Sam himself.</i>
5927807 5929433 I want you!
5929504 5930782 All of you!
5930849 5932639 <i>"All of you." he's saying.</i>
5932707 5934497 He looks like a big flag.
5934564 5936955 I want you.<br />You.
5937030 5939486 - Is he talkin' to me?<br />- He's talkin' to you.
5939655 5942210 - Is he talkin' to me?<br />- Let him talk while he can talk.
5942281 5943875 I want the Stallion!
5944523 5946696 <i>He says, "I want the Stallion.<br />I want the Stallion."</i>
5948110 5951145 <i>In foreign countries,<br />during WWI,</i>

6031208 6032965 <i>Now he's coming over<br />to talk to the Champ.</i>
6033033 6034376 - Hey, how 'bout that?<br />- Hey, Joe.
6034442 6037793 - You've been ducking me long time.<br />- No, Joe. You're next, Joe.
6037869 6040554 - I want you, you understand?<br />- You're next, Joe!
6040623 6042150 They must be friends.
6050166 6052022 Joe Frazier!
6052087 6056400 <i>The fight is on the way. Settle down<br />because it won't be long now.</i>
6057563 6061973 <i>And now...<br />for the main event.</i>
6066881 6068737 <i>The challenger,</i>
6068803 6073116 <i>white trunks,<br />weighing 190 pounds,</i>
6073190 6075580 <i>Philadelphia's favorite son,</i>
6075655 6080612 <i>The Italian Stallion,<br />Rocky Balboa.</i>
6086864 6089254 <i>And on my right,</i>
6089329 6091403 <i>wearing red, white and blue,</i>
6091475 6094893 <i>weighing 210 pounds,</i>
6094965 6098262 <i>undefeated in 46 fights,</i>
6098328 6101144 <i>the master of disaster,</i>
6101210 6104758 <i>the undisputed,<br />heavyweight champion of the world</i>
6104828 6106902 <i>Apollo Creed.</i>
6108895 6111318 I want you and you.<br />You. You.
6113602 6116157 You, chump.<br />I want you!
6116228 6119264 You boys both fought in Philadelphia<br />before, and you know the rules.
6119335 6122239 No low blows,<br />watch your heads, no butting.
6122313 6123743 Shake hands now<br />and come out fightin'.
6123818 6125477 Put your hands up there, chump.
6125547 6127458 - Come out fightin'.<br />- Come on. Come on.
6129646 6131305 <i>Rocky's takin' it carefully.</i>
6131374 6134890 <i>He's just going over and being calm,<br />it looks like from here.</i>
6135954 6137232 <i>There goes the big hat.</i>
6140373 6143408 <i>I've never seen a fighter<br />that concerned about his hair.</i>
6152286 6153880 <i>And there's the bell<br />for round one.</i>
6155199 6158235 <i>The fighters come into the center<br />of the ring, looking at each other.</i>
6158306 6159583 <i>Rocky just looking.</i>
6159651 6164837 <i>The Champion gives one<br />of the left-handed jabs right there.</i>
6166408 6169759 <i>The Champ's stinging,<br />the slower challenger jabs at will.</i>
6169834 6173666 <i>In fact, it just looks like Rocky's<br />blocking the blows with his face.</i>
6173740 6175978 <i>The Champion doesn't look<br />the best he's ever been,</i>
6176046 6177673 <i>but he's really moving now.</i>
6177743 6179817 <i>Well, the Champion<br />is smiling now.</i>
6179889 6181232 <i>He's toying with this man.</i>
6182163 6184074 Trying to give the fans<br />their money's worth.
6186678 6189714 <i>He's very clearly outdoing<br />the challenger right now.</i>
6190521 6192278 I'll get you. Come on.
6192346 6196026 <i>He's just trying to make this man<br />make him... see! Make him miss like that.</i>
6197469 6199860 <i>Oh, the Champ<br />is just taunting him now.</i>
6202945 6204375 <i>He's dancing around.</i>
6205827 6207651 <i>I don't believe it!</i>
6207717 6209923 <i>- The Champ is down.<br />- Yes, he is!</i>
6215722 6218986 <i>Creed is down!<br />What a surprise this is!</i>
6220013 6223212 <i>This is the first time the Champion<br />has ever been knocked down.</i>
6225297 6228431 Six... seven... eight.
6228499 6231086 <i>Appears to be all right.<br />A little glassy-eyed, but okay.</i>
6232918 6235855 Let's go to work right now, Rock!<br />Come on!
6237082 6240280 <i>Now Rocky coming back out,<br />and he's like a bull in a china closet.</i>
6240348 6241625 <i>He really wants it.</i>
6243742 6245336 <i>Boy, the Champion's<br />coming back.</i>
6245407 6248443 <i>He's coming off the floor now,<br />and he's trying...</i>
6248514 6251069 <i>A left, a right, another left,<br />another right, combination!</i>
6251140 6253859 <i>Into the face!<br />And that's the Apollo we know.</i>
6257672 6258950 <i>Now he's taunting him.</i>
6259017 6261026 <i>He's taunting Rocky.<br />"Come on, let's go."</i>
6261099 6262409 <i>Left. There's another left.</i>
6263244 6264259 <i>Another left.</i>
6266030 6267722 <i>There!</i>
6269136 6271374 <i>Left and right.<br />Rocky's got him on the rope!</i>
6271442 6272555 Come on.
6272627 6273904 Okay, break.
6273971 6275565 Punch. Hit me. Hit me.
6279095 6282131 <i>I tell you, there's no way we expected<br />this kind of hitting from him.</i>
6282201 6284308 <i>Oh, no way,<br />but with the ability of the Champion...</i>
6288926 6291797 <i>Apollo unloading a left, really<br />trying to get him up against the ropes.</i>
6300262 6302685 <i>They're leading him over to his corner.<br />Rocky can hardly find his way.</i>
6302760 6304769 <i>He's sitting down now.</i>
6304842 6306468 I told ya! I told ya!
6306538 6307816 Your nose is broke.
6307883 6310154 - How's it look?<br />- Ah, it's an improvement.
6310221 6313452 I want you to quit chuckin' and jivin'.<br />I want you to stick and move.
6313519 6316871 Go for the ribs.<br />Don't let that bastard breathe.
6316946 6318288 The guy's great.
6318354 6322187 He doesn't know it's a damn show.<br />He thinks it's a damn fight.
6322262 6324751 Finish this bum and let's go home.
6325240 6327958 Stay to the body. The body!<br />You're doing great!
6331452 6333046 <i>Creed got knocked down<br />at the end of the first.</i>
6333117 6336567 <i>He came back strong at the end<br />of the first, but he's working hard.</i>
6336640 6339676 <i>A smart left.<br />Another left and a right.</i>
6339746 6342169 <i>And now coming<br />into the corner again.</i>
6348808 6351942 <i>Oh, Balboa's taking<br />a tremendous beating here.</i>
6356975 6358831 Oh, come on, man. Can't you fight?
6358896 6361767 Stop clownin' around here<br />and give these people something to see.
6363443 6364873 <i>He says he wants him!</i>
6365940 6369936 <i>If you folks aren't aware... you're<br />watching a battle... I tell you that.</i>
6374267 6375577 <i>Balboa trying to fight back.</i>
6375643 6377717 <i>Oh! He tagged the Champ<br />with a tremendous hook!</i>
6377789 6380027 <i>The Champion is trying<br />to get himself out of there,</i>
6380094 6381589 <i>but he just can't do it.</i>
6381663 6384665 <i>He is being barraged with lefts<br />and rights to the head, to the body.</i>
6384737 6388537 <i>Balboa is smacking the Champion<br />right on the kisser.</i>
6389349 6392766 <i>And the referee's... they're ready<br />to keep going. Look at that!</i>
6392839 6395175 - Back to your corner.<br />- Put that chump back in his corner.
6395241 6397829 <i>- Come on, Creed.<br />- Balboa doesn't want to quit. Hey.</i>
6397899 6399427 <i>This is gonna be a tough one.</i>
6451857 6454095 <i>Now he's got him. A left.</i>
6463865 6466038 <i>A hard left<br />and a right combination.</i>
6466107 6468760 <i>What is keeping him up, Bill?<br />I don't know.</i>
6471423 6473529 <i>He can't even get his gloves up<br />to protect himself.</i>
6473600 6475358 <i>He needs to stop, Bill.</i>
6481030 6483268 Down! Down!<br />Stay down!
6483335 6485573 <i>Apollo dancing around<br />with his arms in the air.</i>
6495888 6499021 ...five... six...
6500051 6503534 seven... eight... nine...
6512668 6514425 <i>Apollo can't believe it.</i>
6530889 6534088 <i>The Champion got a left<br />to the ribs... his right rib.</i>
6534155 6536229 <i>Oh, this has been<br />a tremendous...</i>
6541809 6544199 - Okay, Champ?<br />- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.
6544274 6546993 It hurts, though.<br />He broke my rib.
6547060 6549200 I can't see nothin'.<br />You gotta open my eye.
6549269 6551027 - Cut me, Mick.<br />- I don't wanna do it!
6551095 6553846 Go on, cut me.<br />Cut me.
6553914 6555573 Try it.
6559421 6560851 Oh, God.
6560926 6563262 You're bleeding inside, Champ.<br />I'm gonna stop the fight, understand?
6563327 6566591 You ain't stoppin' nothin', man.<br />You ain't stoppin' nothin'.
6566658 6569377 - You stop this fight, I'll kill ya.<br />- All right.
6569444 6573024 - Go if you wanna go.<br />- I'm goin'.
6573094 6575813 You gotta go.<br />You gotta give it all. Give it all!
6575881 6577954 You gotta get him.<br />You gotta work on that body.
6582221 6585093 <i>The crowd is on fire.<br />The 15th and final round.</i>
6593493 6595797 <i>They look like they've been<br />in a war... these two.</i>
6604573 6606964 <i>Oh, the Champion<br />really tagged him!</i>
6607039 6610619 <i>And Apollo clearly protecting<br />his right side... his ribs.</i>
6615781 6617309 <i>Hard left and right!</i>
6617382 6620733 <i>- Look at the blood coming from his face.<br />- Oh, he's spitting up blood now.</i>
6624171 6626922 <i>A tremendous right hand by Rocky.</i>
6626988 6628396 Go for it! Go for it, Rock!
6628462 6631114 <i>Listen to this crowd!</i>
6631183 6634830 <i>Oh! Another to the rib.<br />That left hand again right to the chin!</i>
6634898 6636623 <i>Oh! He's got him<br />up against the ropes!</i>
6636691 6637707 <i>Apollo the Champ.</i>
6641975 6644694 Ain't gonna be no rematch.<br />Ain't gonna be no rematch.
6645370 6646483 Don't want one.
6656738 6659260 Rocky, you went the 15 rounds.<br />How do you feel?
6659332 6660347 I feel all right.
