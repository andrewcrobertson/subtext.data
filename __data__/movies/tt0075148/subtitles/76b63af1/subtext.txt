908805 912400 When you don't do what I tell you<br />to do, you make me look bad, Rock.

1270667 1274364 I must've had 20 bucks taken<br />out of there in the past six years.
1274437 1277065 It don't sound like much,<br />but it adds up, you know.

1304367 1306198 Too many creeps<br />around here, you know.
1307037 1308868 Every other block,<br />there's a creep.

1448011 1452607 Well, I just don't think Gazzo's hirin'<br />right now, you know? You know?
1452682 1453842 Come on.
1457787 1459948 - The girl's dryin' up.<br />- Who?
1460023 1463686 My sister. If she don't start livin',<br />her body's gonna dry up.
1463760 1465990 You know, tomorrow's Thanksgiving,<br />you know that?
1466062 1467893 Why don't you come over<br />and talk to her?
1467964 1469363 Sure. Beer.
1469432 1471423 Tomorrow you come<br />for some bird, right?
1471501 1474265 Absolutely. You got it.
1474337 1477306 I gotta go. If I'm ten minutes late,<br />she calls the hospital.
1477373 1479068 - Paulie!<br />- I got it. I got it.
1479142 1481633 <i>Bicentennial fight with</i><br /><i>Mac Lee Green here in Philadelphia</i>
1481711 1484578 <i>at the fabulous Spectrum.</i><br /><i>Harry?</i>
1484647 1487138 <i>We're speaking now of your</i><br /><i>much publicized bicentennial fight.</i>
1487217 1488377 <i>That's right, this is gonna be</i>
1488451 1490282 <i>the greatest sporting event</i><br /><i>in the country's history.</i>
1490353 1493516 <i>A gala occurrence with me</i><br /><i>beating Green like he committed a crime.</i>
1493590 1496252 Would you take a look<br />at that guy?
1496326 1498817 I mean, where are<br />the real fighters gonna come from?
1498895 1501830 The pros. All we got today<br />are jig clowns.
1501898 1504230 <i>- On January 1st,</i><br /><i>the first major event in the country...</i>
1504300 1507463 - Clowns?<br />- That's right. Clowns.
1507537 1510199 <i>And in keeping with great events</i><br /><i>throughout the country's history.</i>
1510273 1512867 <i>Apollo Creed will duplicate</i><br /><i>the cracking of the liberty bell</i>
1512942 1514273 <i>by cracking Mac Lee Green.</i>
1514344 1516835 You callin' Apollo Creed a clown?
1516913 1518972 Well, what else?<br />Look at him.
1519048 1521380 <i>Stay in school</i><br /><i>and use your brain.</i>
1521451 1524386 <i>Be a doctor, be a lawyer,</i><br /><i>carry a leather briefcase.</i>
1524454 1526285 <i>Forget about sports</i><br /><i>as a profession.</i>
1526356 1528017 <i>Sports make you grunt and smell.</i>
1528091 1531549 <i>- See, be a thinker, not a stinker.</i><br /><i>- Okay, thanks a lot, Champ.</i>
1531628 1534222 Hey, are you crazy?<br />This man is champion of the world.
1534297 1537357 He took his best shot<br />and became champ. Huh?
1537433 1539264 What shot did you ever take?
1539335 1542827 Hey, Rocky, you're not happy<br />with your life, it's nice.
1542906 1546000 But me, I got a business going.<br />I don't have to take no shots.
1546075 1547804 <i>No one having gone more than...</i>
1547877 1549037 That's right.
1550847 1552678 Stick that up your business.
1552749 1554614 What are you so insulted about?
1555318 1559846 Want me to take a shot?<br />All right... I'll take a shot.
1572001 1573332 Rocky, how's it been going?
1573403 1574893 Hey, Rocky,<br />how 'bout a bottle?
1574971 1577303 - No wine.<br />- Come on. Just a little.
1580410 1582503 Rory, does your brother<br />know you're hanging out so late?
1582579 1584774 - Screw you, Go-go.<br />- Her brother knows.
1584847 1587008 Hey, these guys teach you<br />to talk like that?
1587083 1589517 - Stuff it, man!<br />- Never say that! Come here!
1589586 1592146 You stink up the neighborhood!
1594924 1596585 - You know, you can...<br />- Hey!
1596659 1597921 When I was your age,
1597994 1601327 there was only one girl in the<br />whole neighborhood talked like that.
1601397 1604423 That was it. Just one.<br />What are you doing?
1604500 1606468 It'll make your teeth yellow.<br />Don't do that.
1606536 1609369 - I like yellow teeth.<br />- It'll make your breath like garbage.
1609439 1612431 - Maybe I like garbage.<br />- Come on, nobody likes garbage.
1612508 1614999 Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth...<br />she wasn't bad-lookin',
1615078 1617569 but, you see, none of the guys<br />ever took her seriously, see.
1617647 1619581 They never took her out<br />for any serious datin'.
1619649 1621139 - Why?<br />- 'Cause that's the way guys are.
1621217 1623276 They laugh when you talk dirty,<br />they think you're cute,
1623353 1625344 but after a while, you get<br />a reputation, that's it.
1625421 1626911 You get no respect,<br />you understand?
1626990 1630653 You get no respect.<br />And I gotta use a bad word.
1630727 1633218 Whore.<br />You understand? Whore.
1633296 1634957 See, you use dirty words
1635031 1637556 and maybe you end up becoming<br />a whore, you understand?
1637634 1639295 Come on, Rocky.<br />I'm just 12.
1639369 1641860 Hey, that don't matter<br />that you're 12. It don't matter.
1641938 1645999 You don't really have to be one.<br />You just act like one... that's it. Boom.
1646075 1649010 Hey, if you get a bad rap,<br />you understand?
1649078 1651239 Twenty years from now,<br />people are gonna say,
1651314 1653145 "Hey, you remember Marie?"
1653216 1654615 "No, who's she?"
1654684 1657244 "She's the little whore that hung out<br />at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."
1657320 1659982 "Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah,<br />now I remember her."
1660056 1663321 You see, they don't remember you,<br />they remember the rep.
1663393 1664724 You understand?
1665962 1667793 Hey, you got a boyfriend?
1667864 1669695 No, you ain't got a boyfriend.
1669766 1672428 You know why? Why don't you<br />think you have a boyfriend?
1672502 1675300 'Cause you're hangin' out with them<br />coconuts in the corner, understand?
1675371 1677100 You hang around coconuts,<br />you get nowhere.
1677173 1679004 They're lemons.<br />Lemons.
1679075 1682238 You hang out with nice people,<br />you get nice friends, you understand?
1682311 1684802 You hang out with smart people,<br />you get smart friends.
1684881 1687281 You hang out with yo-yo people,<br />you get yo-yo friends.
1687350 1689511 You see?<br />It's simple mathematics.
1690787 1692118 - I hope you ain't...<br />- I won't.
1692188 1693348 What was I gonna say?
1693423 1696586 You hope I don't keep acting like<br />a whore, or I'll turn into one, right?
1696659 1698718 - Yeah, something like that.<br />- Good night, Rocky.
1698795 1700262 Good night, Marie.<br />Take care, you know?
1700329 1702126 - Hey, Rocky?<br />- Yo.
1702198 1704132 Screw you, creep-o!
1711774 1714607 Yeah, who are you<br />to give advice, creep-o? Huh?
1714677 1715837 Who are you?
1734897 1737832 - Are the doctor's reports confirmed?<br />- Definitely.
1737900 1739731 It says here Mac Lee Green
1739802 1744136 has suffered a severely cracked<br />third metacarpal in his left hand.
1744207 1745868 Damn.
1745942 1748206 Of course, we can<br />cancel the fight indefinitely
1748277 1749869 if you're set on fighting Green.
1749946 1752278 Hey, it ain't just Green!
1752348 1754509 What about all the time<br />Apollo has invested?
1754584 1756552 I believe<br />we can find a solution.
1756619 1758985 Solution nothin'. You better find me<br />another ranked contender.
1759055 1760545 And I mean in a flash, Jergens.
1760623 1762284 Don't play games with my client.
1762358 1764826 Apollo's already done<br />a million dollars worth of publicity,
1764894 1767886 has made contractual obligations<br />with 20 different organizations...
1767964 1769454 he's not going<br />to be embarrassed!
1769532 1772296 I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.
1772368 1774359 Ernie's fighting in France<br />that same week.
1774437 1776735 Then get me Buddy Shaw!<br />Hell, he's ranked fifth!
1776806 1779832 Went to California<br />and gained 50 pounds.
1779909 1781740 I get a hold of every<br />worthwhile contender
1781811 1783403 and they all say the same thing...
1783479 1786141 five weeks just isn't enough time<br />to get into shape.
1786215 1788547 Shape nothin', man!<br />They're afraid.
1788618 1790609 They know everybody in the world's<br />gonna see this fight,
1790686 1792517 and none of them's<br />got a prayer of whippin' me.
1792588 1794681 They're makin' excuses<br />so they don't have to be the chump
1794757 1796691 to get whipped in front<br />of the whole civilized world.
1796759 1799751 All I can say<br />is I'm a good promoter.
1799829 1802855 I've promoted fights<br />in every goddamn country in the world,
1802932 1805332 and I've broken my ass over this one.
1805401 1807733 But I don't know<br />what the hell else to do!
1813075 1814235 I do.
1816612 1817772 Without a ranked contender,
1817847 1820509 what this fight is gonna need<br />is a novelty.
1821184 1823175 This is the land<br />of opportunity, right?
1823686 1826177 So Apollo Creed,<br />on January 1st,
1826255 1829986 gives a local underdog fighter<br />an opportunity.
1830059 1831390 A snow-white underdog,
1831460 1834293 and I'm gonna put his face<br />on this poster with me.
1834363 1836194 And I'll tell you why.
1836265 1837926 Because I'm sentimental.
1838601 1841331 And a lot of other people<br />in this country are just as sentimental,
1841404 1844237 and there's nothing they'd like better<br />than to see Apollo Creed
1844307 1845797 give a local Philadelphia boy
1845875 1849936 a shot at the greatest title in the world<br />on this country's biggest birthday.
1850012 1851843 Now, that's the way I see it.
1852515 1854506 And that's the way it's gonna be.
1854584 1856745 Apollo, I like it.
1856819 1859344 It's very American.
1859422 1861083 No, Jergens.
1861157 1862818 It's very smart.
1876706 1878435 Okay, I'll see you later, man.
1886816 1889148 - What? What is it?<br />- I just wanna check this thing out.
1889218 1891686 Now, you said pick up<br />two yards from Snyder
1891754 1893244 and a grand from Cappoli, right?
1893322 1897156 No, no. No, no. Two yards<br />from Cappoli and a grand from Snyder.
1897226 1899057 - Two yards. Two yards.<br />- Write it down, okay?
1899128 1900618 Yeah, I got it. Got it.
1900696 1903096 Who's this girl you're going<br />out with tomorrow night?
1904433 1905593 How'd you know?
1905668 1907659 You know.<br />Don't you think I hear things?
1907737 1909671 A lot of canaries<br />flying around the docks.
1909739 1912207 - I'm going out with Paulie's sister.<br />- Hey, Rocky.
1912275 1914470 - What?<br />- I hear she's retarded.
1914543 1916534 She ain't retarded.<br />She's shy, you know?
1916612 1918102 I'll tell you what to do.
1918180 1921377 Take her to the zoo.<br />I hear retards like the zoo.
1921450 1923782 - This bum gotta say that?<br />- Who're you calling a bum?
1923853 1926117 - I'm calling you a bum!<br />- Okay, relax. Relax.
1926188 1928179 Buddy's in a bad mood.<br />It's his prostate.
1928257 1929747 He's always in a bad mood.
1929825 1931656 You know, you oughta count<br />your blessings, Buddy.
1931727 1933524 You're still a healthy person,<br />you know that?
1933596 1935587 - I don't like your face.<br />- I don't like yours, either!
1935665 1937496 - Kiss my ass!<br />- Move your shoulders down!
1937566 1940399 - Get out of the car!<br />- Relax, relax! Relax. My ears.
1940469 1942801 What, are you driving me crazy?<br />Both of yous.
1944840 1946501 - Buddy doesn't like you.<br />- Yeah.
1946575 1949305 Some guys, they just hate<br />for no reason, <i>capisce?</i>
1949378 1950868 - Yeah.<br />- Come here.
1952581 1955914 There's 50 bucks. You and your girl<br />Adrian have a nice time, you hear?
1955985 1957043 Thanks.
1958321 1960050 Hey, how'd you know her name?
1960122 1961987 You don't think I hear things?
1962992 1964653 - Hey, Rock.<br />- What?
1964727 1966558 - Remember what I told you.<br />- What'd you tell me?
1966629 1967789 Take her to the zoo.
1975838 1978534 - Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?<br />- No, thanks, Shirley.
1979909 1981740 What do you think<br />about Billy Snow?
1981811 1982971 Fouls.
1984280 1985770 How 'bout Big Chuck Smith?
1985848 1988009 - Yeah.<br />- Nah. He's too old and dull.
1988718 1990379 Hey, Bobby Judd.<br />He's a good boy.
1990453 1992421 No, I don't feel any heat<br />from that name.
1992488 1994479 Joe Zach's a good prospect.
1995658 1998320 Exactly what are<br />you looking for, Apollo?
1999328 2001990 This is what I'm looking for.
2002064 2003998 The Italian Stallion.
2004667 2007397 Rocky Balboa?<br />Never heard of him.
2007470 2009631 Look, it's the name, man.
2009705 2014369 The Italian Stallion.<br />The media will eat it up.
2014443 2017276 Now, who discovered America?<br />An Italian, right?
2017346 2020679 What would be better than to get it on<br />with one of his descendents?
2020750 2022581 He's a southpaw.
2022651 2024312 I don't want you messing around<br />with southpaws.
2024387 2026446 - They do everything backwards.<br />- Southpaw nothin'.
2026522 2027921 I'll drop him in three.
2029525 2033928 Apollo Creed<br />meets the Italian Stallion.
2034964 2037364 Sounds like a damn monster movie.
2037700 2039691 Hey, what are you doing<br />with that bat, huh?
2039769 2043034 I used to be deadly at stickball.<br />You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?
2043105 2044265 She's very excited.
2044340 2046604 - Look at my swollen hands.<br />- Yeah.
2046675 2049838 The joints from walkin' and<br />carryin' meat in and out of freezers.
2049912 2051243 It plays hell on the joints.
2051313 2053474 Maybe you oughta see a doctor.<br />What do you think?
2053549 2055642 I don't need a doctor.<br />I need a different job.
2055718 2058118 Different job. What kind of turkey?<br />Big turkey or small turkey?
2058187 2063181 Talk to Gazzo about me. Tell him<br />I'm a good man and nothin' bothers me.
2063259 2066422 I'd make a great collector.<br />Bustin' bones don't bother me.
2066495 2068929 Don't bother you.<br />A big turkey, right? Huh?
2068998 2072331 Gazzo's gotta come... forget Gazzo.<br />It's a bad job, you know what I mean?
2072401 2075802 - You got a match?<br />- Go to him for me. As a favor.
2075871 2078499 Yeah. Yeah. You know,<br />the last time I had a turkey
2078574 2080235 was when they<br />were having a $2 special
2080309 2082243 at Horn and Hardog's<br />about three years ago.
2082311 2084973 Last year me and the turtles<br />had spam. What do you think?
2085047 2087140 Yeah, that sounds<br />like a good idea.
2092955 2094786 Your sister knows<br />I'm coming for sure, right?
2094857 2097087 Yeah, yeah.<br />She's very excited.
2098527 2100290 I'm all alone
2100362 2102523 Hey, will you forget<br />about Gazzo, huh?
2103432 2106924 - I don't ask nobody twice.<br />- I don't ask nobody twice.
2107002 2110062 Stay away, baby
2111807 2114401 Hey, your sister... you sure<br />your sister knows I'm comin'?
2114477 2116308 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />She's very excited.
2116378 2117402 Yeah?
2120316 2122307 Paulie? You're late.
2123052 2126385 Called the hospital? She calls<br />the hospital if I'm ten minutes late.
2128390 2129880 How you doin'?
2130960 2132894 I told you she's very excited.
2135831 2138664 Paulie, why didn't you tell me<br />you were bringing him here?
2138734 2140224 Look at me.<br />I'm not ready for this.
2140302 2142031 Would it make a difference<br />if you were?
2142104 2144095 He's a friend,<br />and now he's taking you out.
2144173 2145504 No, I can't.
2146175 2148769 You're in the kitchen,<br />and I want you out right now.
2152548 2153537 Hey.
2154216 2155649 Hey!
2155718 2158551 Hey, I want you<br />outta here instamatically!
2158621 2161454 I'm sick of seein' you hanging around<br />like a freakin' spider!
2161524 2163685 Go out! Live!<br />Enjoy life!
2163759 2165249 Paulie, I can't go!
2165327 2167318 Don't get wise with me,<br />now, huh?
2167396 2170888 - I'm tired of you being a loser.<br />- Don't call me that, Paulie!
2170966 2174299 <i>Apollo Creed says he'll</i><br /><i>be shopping for another victim</i>
2174370 2178067 <i>to fill Green's vacancy for</i><br /><i>the bicentennial championship fight.</i>
2178140 2179971 Why didn't you tell me<br />you were bringing him home?
2180042 2183409 - How do you know I didn't?<br />- I'm not gonna go, Paulie! I can't go!
2183479 2185208 - I won't go!<br />- Why?!
2186615 2189880 Paulie, it's Thanksgivin'.<br />I got a turkey in the oven.
2190653 2193053 Oh. A turkey in the oven?
2199428 2200918 A turkey in the oven.
2207903 2209564 You want the bird?
2210306 2212297 Go in the alley<br />and eat the bird.
2212374 2214342 Oh, Paulie.
2215144 2218272 I want you outta here!<br />Get outta the house!
2218347 2220941 Go out and enjoy<br />your freakin' life!
2225054 2226783 You hungry, Rock?
2233329 2236992 Yo, Paulie, listen. Maybe we just<br />better forget all this, you know?
2237066 2239057 - Just forget it.<br />- Forget nothin'.
2239134 2240624 Go ahead.<br />Tell her somethin' funny.
2240703 2244104 Ain't nothin' to talk about. She's in<br />a bad mood, I'm in a bad mood.
2244173 2246835 You know how to do funny.<br />You wanna go out with my sister?
2246909 2249969 - Yeah.<br />- Well... come on.
2252581 2254071 I don't know what to say.
2267129 2269620 Yo, Adrian,<br />it's me, Rocky.
2269698 2271097 Rocky, you know?
2272101 2273432 Listen, uh...
2275271 2276602 I don't know what to say,
2276672 2279402 'cause I ain't never talked<br />to no door before, you know?
2281210 2284077 I mean, what do I say<br />to a door... hey, listen...
2284146 2285875 Come on.<br />You're doin' fine.
2285948 2288348 I ain't doin' fine.<br />I look like an idiot.
2288417 2290408 Keep doin' what you're doin'.<br />You're funny.
2290486 2292477 I know all about these things.
2292554 2293953 I feel like a jerk.
2300529 2303020 Yo, Adrian,<br />it's Rocky again, you know?
2303098 2304429 Listen, uh...
2305434 2308096 I know you ain't too happy<br />at this moment, you know,
2308170 2309762 but could you do me a favor?
2309838 2312830 I ain't got nobody to spend<br />Thanksgiving with, you know?
2312908 2314569 So, uh...
2314643 2318238 how 'bout maybe you and I maybe<br />go out together, get something to eat.
2318314 2321044 I don't know. Maybe laugh a little bit.<br />Who knows, you know?
2321116 2322606 Would you like to, uh...
2324420 2327480 I don't know. Would you like to maybe,<br />you know, you and me go out together?
2327556 2329387 What do you think?<br />Would you like to?
2335097 2336587 We're gonna have a good time.
2337700 2339531 We'll have a real good time.
2344473 2345804 Thanks for the bird.
2349778 2352372 I'm gonna turn the TV off.<br />I got a headache.
2365160 2367651 - What does your sister like to do?<br />- Ice skate.
2367730 2369721 Adrian, come on.<br />You're lettin' the heat out.
2369798 2371527 Who pays the bills around here?
2377439 2380169 Listen, I don't want<br />no turkey anyway, you know?
2382277 2383938 But it was Thanksgiving.
2385080 2387344 - It was what?<br />- It was Thanksgiving.
2387416 2390078 Yeah, to you.<br />But to me it's Thursday.
2415043 2417773 - It looks kinda quiet, you know?<br />- I think it's closed.
2417846 2420508 No, I think maybe we're just early<br />or something like that.
2421083 2422243 - Yo!<br />- Yo!
2422317 2424478 - We're closed.<br />- What?
2424553 2425884 I said we're closed.
2425954 2428445 Yeah. Hey, listen, I'm gonna<br />smooth this guy out here.
2428524 2431015 So just wait here for a few minutes.<br />I'll be right back, okay?
2431093 2432924 - We could go someplace else.<br />- No, it's okay.
2432995 2434929 Hey, listen, are you closed<br />to the general public,
2434997 2437158 or are you closed to everybody...<br />you know what I mean?
2437232 2441396 Look, it's after 6:00, it's Thanksgiving.<br />That's why there's nobody here.
2441470 2443529 And besides, you ain't<br />supposed to be in here.
2443605 2445937 So do me a favor<br />and not stay here, huh?
2446008 2450001 - Would you do me a favor?<br />- Hey, come on. We're not operatin'.
2450078 2452740 Look... this girl here<br />ain't feelin' well, you know.
2452815 2455375 The doctors say she should go out<br />and exercise once in a while,
2455451 2457612 and ice skating's probably<br />the best thing, know what I mean?
2457686 2459176 So what do you want from me?
2459254 2462382 I want you to do me a favor.<br />You could see she ain't feelin' too good.
2462458 2465586 If you could let her on the ice,<br />I'd appreciate it. For a few minutes.
2465661 2467492 Ten minutes, ten bucks.
2467563 2469827 Ten bucks? How 'bout eight...<br />eight bucks?
2469898 2472230 Come on. It's Thanksgiving.
2472301 2474292 All right, nine bucks,<br />you got a deal.
2474369 2476667 You have the ice to yourself.<br />Ten bucks.
2479208 2480539 Give her the blades.
2481844 2482902 Aren't you skating?
2482978 2484969 Nah. I ain't skated since I was 15.
2485047 2487379 That's when I started fightin'...<br />when I was 15.
2487449 2489781 Skating's kinda bad<br />for the ankles, you know?
2489852 2491251 Yeah.
2491320 2492981 You're a pretty good skater,<br />are you?
2494723 2497556 You know, like I was saying before<br />on the way over here.
2497626 2500561 Fightin' used to be tops<br />with me, but no more, you know?
2500629 2503291 All I wanted to do at a fight<br />was prove I was no bum...
2503365 2505731 that I had the stuff<br />to make a good pro, you know?
2505801 2507132 You never got the chance?
2507202 2511036 Hey, I ain't cryin' about it, 'cause I<br />still fight. I kinda do it like a hobby.
2511106 2513370 I tell you what the trouble is...<br />I'm a southpaw.
2513442 2516104 - What's a southpaw?<br />- A southpaw means you're left-handed.
2516178 2518669 And a southpaw<br />throws your timing off, you see.
2518747 2521079 Other guys it throws their timing off,<br />makes them look awkward.
2521149 2522878 Nobody wants to look awkward.
2522951 2525818 - You know where southpaw came from?<br />- Nine minutes!
2525888 2529221 I'll tell ya. A long time ago, this guy...<br />maybe a couple hundred years ago...
2529291 2532692 he was fightin' in the...<br />I think it was around Philadelphia...
2532761 2534422 and his arm... he was left-handed,
2534496 2537761 and his arm was facing towards<br />New Jersey, you see, and that's south.
2537833 2540666 So then that's why they<br />call 'em southpaw, you see?
2540736 2545435 Southpaw, South Jersey.<br />South Camden, southpaw.
2545507 2546667 You know what I mean?
2547876 2550367 I don't know. Things probably<br />worked out for the best, don't you think?
2550445 2552936 Never got a chance, though,<br />because you're left-handed, huh?
2553015 2555848 Well, that's absolutely true,<br />you know. Watch out.
2559721 2561712 I just dislocated my finger.
2562424 2565916 Look at that. No, wait.<br />Hey, it ain't your fault. Look.
2565994 2568986 See? Look, I had it...<br />it's an old wound, you see that?
2569064 2571897 Look. See?<br />Nothin'. It bends like that, see?
2571967 2573867 I originally done it...<br />look, push the button.
2573936 2575927 Bong. It works.<br />It ain't your fault.
2576004 2578666 - Look, I'm gonna show you somethin'.<br />- Seven minutes!
2578740 2581903 Yeah, I originally done it.<br />I carry pictures of all my fights.
2581977 2584775 I originally done it<br />in the Baby Crenshaw fight. See that?
2584846 2588043 Big Baby's about the size of an airplane.<br />I broke both my hands on his face.
2588116 2591279 I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,<br />don't you think? See how it works there?
2591353 2592513 Real nice.
2593989 2595479 Come on.<br />You having a good time?
2596325 2600318 I'll tell you... you could see<br />I ain't too graceful. I don't move well.
2600395 2603728 But I'll tell you, I can really swat, you<br />know what I mean? I can really hit hard.
2603799 2606962 But I'm a southpaw, and nobody wants<br />to fight no southpaw, know what mean?
2607035 2608093 Huh?
2612608 2614439 You know how I<br />got started in fightin'?
2615344 2616606 - Huh?<br />- No.
2617412 2619471 Am I talkin' too loud?
2619548 2621140 - No.<br />- Three minutes!
2621216 2625585 My father... he's, uh...<br />my old man, he was never too smart.
2625654 2628122 He says to me, "You weren't born<br />with much of a brain,
2628190 2630522 so you better start using<br />your body," right?
2630592 2631923 So I become a fighter.
2631994 2633222 Oh.
2633295 2635024 - You know what I mean?<br />- Yeah.
2635097 2636928 Why are you...<br />why are you laughin'?
2638100 2641160 My mother...<br />she said the opposite thing.
2641236 2643227 What'd she say?<br />What'd she say, the opposite?
2643972 2646440 She said you weren't born<br />with much of a body,
2646508 2648135 so you better develop your brain.
2648210 2649370 Did she say that?
2649444 2651674 Yo! Time!
2651747 2653908 Can I ask you a question?
2653982 2655313 Absolutely.
2656485 2659750 - Why do you wanna fight?<br />- 'Cause I can't sing or dance.
2659821 2661652 Eh, oh.
2661790 2663519 Don't fall! Don't fall!
2664359 2666850 Hey, that was terrific.<br />I'm pretty good at this.
2666928 2668259 You like the way I skate?
2668330 2671390 The last fight I had, I had<br />with this guy named Spider Rico.
2671466 2674094 He busted my head up.<br />You see that scar?
2674169 2677502 I'll tell ya...<br />things get pretty rough in the ring.
2686748 2689911 You know, with some people,<br />I'm very shy by nature, you know?
2690585 2691745 I suppose.
2695023 2697617 I say you're very shy<br />by nature, you know?
2699027 2700358 I suppose.
2701329 2704924 Ey! Ey.<br />The bum from the dark.
2705000 2706763 Get a job, you bum!
2707569 2710504 You know, some people think<br />that being shy is a disease,
2710572 2712403 but it don't bother me none.
2712474 2713873 It don't bother me, either.
2715610 2717669 Then why'd I bother<br />bringing it up, huh?
2717746 2719407 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.
2721283 2723444 I think we make<br />a real sharp couple of coconuts.
2723518 2725679 I'm dumb, you're shy.<br />What do you think, huh?
2728623 2731786 I don't understand why anybody<br />would wanna be a fighter.
2732461 2734622 Hey, you gotta be a moron.
2734696 2738291 You gotta be a moron to wanna be<br />a fighter, you know what I mean?
2738366 2741767 It's a racket where you're<br />almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
2741837 2745466 - I don't think you're a bum.<br />- Well, I'm at least half a bum, you know?
2745540 2747030 But I'll tell ya somethin'.
2748543 2751706 The worst thing about fightin'<br />is the mornin' after, you know?
2751780 2753509 - The mornin' after?<br />- I'll tell you. Yeah.
2753582 2757450 The mornin' after a fight, you're nothing<br />but a large wound, know what I mean?
2757519 2759248 Sometimes I got pains<br />all over me.
2759321 2763052 I feel like callin' a taxi to take me<br />from the bed into the bathroom.
2763125 2764888 Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt,
2764960 2768191 your face is all busted up,<br />your hands are swollen, you know?
2768263 2771096 Look at this face.<br />64 fights. Look at that nose.
2771166 2772497 See that nose?
2772567 2774967 That nose ain't never been broken.<br />64 fights.
2775036 2777869 I've had guys bustin' on it,<br />I had guys chewin' on it,
2777939 2781102 twistin' it, punchin' it...<br />I mean, whack! Boom!
2781176 2783838 These guys,<br />they hittin' my nose all the time.
2783912 2786904 Never broken. I'm very proud of that.<br />Isn't that rare? That's rare.
2787682 2790378 - Why do you do it if it hurts?<br />- Why do you think?
2792187 2795020 'Cause... you can't sing and dance.
2795090 2797581 Yeah, somethin' like that.<br />Somethin' like that.
2797659 2799149 Hey, you wanna come inside?
2802030 2803361 No. I gotta go.
2803431 2805422 Hey, come on.<br />Hey, I got some animals.
2805500 2809231 I got these rare... very rare<br />animals inside. Come on. Come on in.
2809304 2811169 No, no. I gotta go.
2811239 2814402 Well, I gotta go, too.<br />I gotta go to the bathroom. Come on.
2814476 2815738 Come on.
2815811 2818575 - No, I gotta go.<br />- Hey, look at this face.
2818647 2822048 Is that a face you could trust<br />or what? Huh? Is it?
2822117 2824642 They oughta stick this face<br />on a stamp. What do you think?
2826321 2828255 Come on. Come on in.
2833528 2835189 Yo. Come on.
2855517 2856677 Click.
2862457 2864186 Yo, Adrian, are you hungry?
2864259 2865658 No.
2865727 2870061 I got some things in there. If you<br />like soda, some donuts or something.
2870699 2874362 A couple cupcakes.<br />Huh? No?
2874436 2876495 I think I got<br />some chocolate in there.
2876571 2877560 No?
2885614 2886945 Hot in here, you know?
2889584 2891245 I could go for some music.
2897392 2898791 Yo, Adrian.
2898860 2902023 These are the exotic animals<br />I was tellin' you about.
2902097 2904122 These are my friends<br />Cuff and Link.
2904199 2905461 I sold 'em to you.
2905533 2907194 Sure, I know you sold them to me.
2907269 2909829 Remember you were workin'<br />at that pet shop, huh?
2909905 2912999 First day you was there, I came in<br />and bought both these animals, huh?
2913074 2914336 Yeah, I remember that.
2914409 2916138 I came and I bought this bowl
2916211 2918941 and I bought the, uh, bought<br />the animals themselves, some food,
2919014 2920948 the marbles that go<br />in the bottom there.
2921016 2922847 Remember?<br />Remember that mountain?
2922918 2926752 I had to get rid of that mountain, though,<br />'cause they kept falling over and flipping.
2930525 2933016 Yo, why don't you<br />come on over here and sit down?
2933929 2935590 Hmm?
2935664 2938258 It's a nice couch.<br />I don't know.
2940268 2943396 There's big bugs in there, you know.<br />It's safer over here.
2945473 2947304 You wanna sit down?
2953448 2956042 Uh, these...<br />these your parents?
2956117 2957982 Yeah, that's...<br />that's both of them there.
2958053 2959281 Is this you?
2959354 2961049 Yeah, that's me<br />when I was eight years old.
2961122 2963852 That's the Italian Stallion<br />when he was a baby.
2966361 2969694 Why don't you come on over<br />and make yourself comfortable? Relax.
2974869 2976359 Do you have a phone?
2976438 2977769 No, I ain't got no phone.
2977839 2981172 I had it pulled 'cause of people<br />calling all the time, and, uh,
2981242 2984871 who needs the aggravation,<br />right? The interruptions.
2984946 2986140 Who'd you wanna call?
2986214 2988808 I wanna let my brother<br />know where I am.
2990085 2991245 Why?
2993021 2994511 I think he might be worried.
2994589 2997422 Well, I'll call your brother,<br />if that's the problem.
3000328 3004424 Yo, Paulie, your sister's with me!<br />I'll call yous back later!
3004499 3005659 See ya!
3011806 3014138 What's the matter?<br />You don't like the room, do ya.
3014209 3015540 It's fine.
3015610 3017737 Well, it's only temporary,<br />you know.
3017812 3018972 It's not that.
3024319 3025809 What's the problem?
3025887 3027377 You don't like me?
3027455 3029787 You don't like the turtles?<br />What's the problem?
3029858 3032520 - I don't think I belong here.<br />- It's okay.
3035296 3036786 I don't belong here.
3037832 3041097 Well, you know, it's okay,<br />'cause you're my guest.
3042203 3045400 I don't...<br />know you well enough.
3045473 3049466 I've never been<br />in a man's apartment alone.
3050378 3053541 Well, I...<br />they're all the same. You know.
3058353 3060184 I'm not sure I know you well enough.
3062390 3064415 I don't feel comfortable.
3064492 3067655 Yo, Adrian, you know,<br />I ain't so comfortable either.
3069864 3071456 I should go.
3071533 3074525 Don't go, please.<br />Don't go. Don't go. Don't go.
3075870 3077030 Don't go.

3089417 3091408 You have nice eyes.
3093421 3094911 Do me another favor?
3096424 3098085 Would you take off that hat?
3105033 3106967 I always knew you was pretty.
3108503 3110835 - Don't tease me.<br />- I'm not teasing you.
3114642 3116132 I ain't teasin' ya.
3117545 3120378 I just...<br />wanna kiss you.
3122784 3125184 You don't have to kiss me back<br />if you don't want.
3126054 3127715 But I wanna kiss you.
3200195 3202186 Worm, I heard<br />you had a fight comin' up.
3202263 3205096 Yeah, I'm gonna fight<br />next month.
3205166 3208431 That's good, man. You come down to<br />the gym, we'll see that you get in shape.
3208503 3209663 How's your weight?
3209737 3212069 - I weigh 175.<br />- Hey, Rock. How you doin', babe?
3212140 3214472 - Hey.<br />- Oh, Mick was lookin' for you up there.
3214542 3215600 - For me?<br />- Yeah.
3215677 3217076 - You sure?<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3217145 3220080 He was lookin' for you, Jack.<br />Get on up there and see him.
3220148 3221672 Yeah. It ain't locked, right?
3221749 3223842 - Yeah, yeah.<br />- All right, go on, man.
3238166 3239963 Hey, you got somethin' for me?
3240034 3242764 Yeah, there was some guy here<br />from Miles Jergens lookin' for you.
3242837 3244828 They need sparring partners<br />for Apollo Creed.
3244906 3246396 - You're puttin' me on.<br />- There's the card.
3246474 3248203 - When was he here?<br />- About an hour ago.
3248276 3250938 They're probably lookin' for<br />sparrin' partners for Creed, you know?
3251512 3254003 I said that before,<br />you dumb dago!
3255383 3258841 I've been comin' here for six years,<br />and six years you been stickin' it to me.
3258920 3260182 I wanna know how come.
3260255 3261552 You don't wanna know.
3261623 3263318 Yeah, I wanna know how come.
3263391 3265382 - You wanna know?<br />- I wanna know!
3265460 3267291 Okay, I'm gonna tell ya!
3267362 3270263 'Cause you had the talent<br />to become a good fighter,
3270331 3271730 and instead of that,
3271799 3276566 you became a leg-breaker<br />to some cheap, second-rate loan shark.
3276638 3277969 It's a livin'.
3278039 3279904 It's a waste of life!
3298259 3300090 Yes, may I help you?
3305366 3309530 Oh! You must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.<br />Mr. Jergens is expecting you.
3309604 3310935 Just a moment.
3315910 3318401 Mr. Rocky Balboa<br />to see you, sir.
3319113 3320171 Fine.
3320948 3323610 - Will you please go in, Mr. Balboa.<br />- Can I have that?
3323685 3325175 Oh, certainly.
3325253 3326413 Thanks.
3330591 3332252 Mr. Balboa.
3332860 3334691 How are you?<br />George Jergens.
3334762 3336354 Take a chair, please.
3336431 3337591 Thanks.
3339400 3341231 Mr. Balboa.
3341302 3343293 - Call me Rocky.<br />- Rocky.
3343371 3345362 Tell me, Rocky,<br />you got any representation?
3345440 3346930 You have a manager?
3347008 3348942 - No. It's just me.<br />- Oh.
3349911 3354245 Rocky, I've got a proposition<br />I'd like to make to you.
3354315 3357307 - Uh, sparrin'?<br />- Beg your pardon?
3357385 3359876 Well, it's just I know<br />you're lookin' for sparrin' partners,
3359954 3362218 and I just wanna say<br />I'm very available, you know.
3362290 3363348 I'm sure you are.
3363424 3365585 Absolutely. Sparrin' with the Champ<br />would be an honor.
3365660 3367321 - And you know what, Mr. Jergens?<br />- What?
3367395 3371058 I wouldn't take no cheap shots, either.<br />I'd really be a good sparring partner.
3371132 3372963 You don't understand me, Rocky.
3373835 3375666 My proposition is this...
3376537 3379028 Would you be interested<br />in fighting Apollo Creed
3379107 3381268 for the World<br />Heavyweight Championship?
3386381 3387712 No.
3387782 3389477 Listen, Rocky...
3390251 3392082 Apollo's seen you fight.
3392920 3396481 He likes you.<br />He wants to fight you.
3396557 3398491 Well, it's just that, you see, uh...
3398559 3401494 I fight in clubs, you know.<br />I'm really a ham-and-egger.
3401562 3404963 This guy... he's the best, and, uh,<br />it wouldn't be such a good fight.
3405032 3407364 But thank you very much,<br />you know.
3407435 3409300 I appreciate it and all that.
3409370 3414137 Rocky? Do you believe that America<br />is the land of opportunity?
3415009 3416601 Yeah.
3416677 3419009 Apollo Creed does.
3419080 3421014 And he's gonna prove it<br />to the whole world
3421082 3423983 by giving an unknown<br />a shot at the title.
3424051 3427020 And that unknown is you.
3427088 3428646 He picked you, Rocky.
3430091 3432582 Rocky, it's the chance<br />of a lifetime.
3433428 3435760 You can't pass it by.
3436864 3438263 What do you say?
3443337 3445396 <i>All right, fellas, fellas.</i><br /><i>That's enough pictures.</i>
3445473 3447236 <i>We wanna ask Apollo</i><br /><i>a few questions.</i>
3447308 3449970 <i>Apollo, how do you like</i><br /><i>the city of brotherly love?</i>
3450044 3453377 <i>Well, just being in Philadelphia</i><br /><i>makes me feel patriotic.</i>
3453448 3454938 <i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city</i>
3455016 3457280 <i>comin' up to me on the street</i><br /><i>wishing me the best.</i>
3457351 3460582 <i>I love my Philadelphia brothers,</i><br /><i>and I'm proud to be an American.</i>
3460655 3463488 <i>Champ, Apollo,</i><br /><i>why did you agree to fight a man</i>
3463558 3465992 <i>who has virtually</i><br /><i>no chance of winning?</i>
3466060 3468051 <i>Look, if history proves one thing,</i>
3468129 3471724 <i>American history proves</i><br /><i>that everybody's got a chance to win.</i>
3471799 3474734 <i>Didn't you guys ever hear</i><br /><i>of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>
3474802 3476793 <i>- Apollo, Apollo, Apollo.</i><br /><i>- Yes?</i>
3476871 3479203 <i>It is a coincidence</i><br /><i>that you're fighting a white man</i>
3479273 3481434 <i>on the most celebrated day</i><br /><i>in the country's history?</i>
3481509 3482771 <i>I don't know about that.</i>
3482844 3485039 <i>Is it a coincidence</i><br /><i>that he's fighting a black man</i>
3485112 3487273 <i>on the most celebrated day</i><br /><i>in the country's history?</i>
3487348 3488940 <i>Right on!</i><br /><i>Tell the truth, brother!</i>
3489016 3491746 <i>Listen, Apollo, tell me... how do you</i><br /><i>feel about your challenger?</i>
3491819 3493309 <i>- How do I feel about him?</i><br /><i>- Yeah.</i>
3493387 3495150 <i>What do you mean?</i><br /><i>Come here, Rock.</i>
3495223 3497885 <i>My main man,</i><br /><i>Rocky, ain't you Italian?</i>
3497959 3499221 <i>Yeah, I'm Italian.</i>
3499293 3501124 <i>Well, now, what does that mean?</i>
3501195 3504426 <i>It means if he can't fight,</i><br /><i>I bet he can cook.</i>
3504499 3505659 <i>All right, Rocky.</i>
3505733 3508395 Do me a favor.<br />His lungs... punch 'em out.
3508469 3509868 Paulie.
3509937 3513202 <i>But, Rocky, how do you expect</i><br /><i>to fight Apollo Creed?</i>
3513274 3515504 <i>Uh, well, geez, you know.</i><br /><i>Creed's the best.</i>
3515576 3517840 <i>I guess I'll have to do</i><br /><i>the best I can.</i>
3517912 3520312 <i>Tell me, Rocky,</i><br /><i>just between us...</i>
3520381 3523441 <i>where did you get the name</i><br /><i>"Italian Stallion"?</i>
3523518 3526851 <i>Oh... uh, I invented that</i><br /><i>about eight years ago</i>
3526921 3528354 <i>when I was eatin' dinner.</i>
3528422 3533121 <i>Rocky, now your payday</i><br /><i>will be $150.000.</i>
3533194 3534593 <i>Any comment?</i>
3536130 3539122 <i>You... you got no comment,</i><br /><i>Rocky, right? No comment.</i>
3539200 3540531 <i>Right.</i><br /><i>Thank you, Rocky.</i>
3540601 3543331 <i>Wait a minute. I just wanna</i><br /><i>say hi to my girlfriend, okay?</i>
3543404 3546862 <i>- I, uh...</i><br /><i>- Yo, Adrian! It's me, Rocky.</i>
3546941 3549933 <i>Look at this. Can you believe</i><br /><i>all this? They put a microphone on me.</i>
3550011 3551876 - You didn't.<br /><i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>
3551946 3556178 <i>- Quit pushin', man!</i><br /><i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>
3556250 3559845 Don't it matter he's makin' you<br />out a fool? I'd break his lips.
3559921 3563550 - He's taking cheap shots.<br />- It don't bother me none.
3563624 3568755 Yo, Rock... I guess you'll be looking<br />for people to help you out.
3568829 3573198 - Help in what?<br />- Keep you livin' the clean life.
3573267 3575497 I'll do okay. You know.
3575570 3577299 You need someone to help<br />with the exercise,
3577371 3581467 and someone standing by with a towel,<br />or runnin' errands. You know.
3581542 3584272 Hey, yo, Paulie, who cared<br />about me yesterday, huh? Nobody.
3584345 3586973 So I just think I'm<br />gonna train myself, you know.
3587048 3589107 Without such good people<br />around to help,
3589183 3591208 you don't have<br />such a good chance.
3591285 3594618 Einstein flunked out of school twice.
3594689 3596213 That so?
3596290 3597348 Yeah.
3597425 3600417 Beethoven was deaf.<br />Helen Keller was blind.
3600494 3602428 I think Rocky's<br />got a good chance.
3608736 3610397 Want me to get you<br />a beer, Paulie?
3610471 3614635 Hey, you lookin' to do a good deed?<br />Keep out of my freakin' life!
3615776 3617437 - What'd I do?<br />- Nothin'.
3617511 3621106 - What? Did I say something wrong?<br />- You didn't say nothin'. It's all right.
3621182 3624583 That's right... you didn't say nothin'!<br />Nothin' at all!
3626654 3628713 - I gotta go.<br />- Oh.
3629457 3631220 Where's the freakin' pretzels?!
3634829 3638822 I got the pretzels!<br />Hey! We ain't got any beer?
3639834 3641995 I thought you were supposed<br />to pick up some beer.
3650678 3653169 How'd you like hearing<br />your name on TV tonight?
3655282 3658115 I was shocked.<br />Why'd you do that?
3658185 3660016 Come on.<br />You're puttin' me on, right?
3660087 3661918 Absolutely.
3661989 3663650 What time should I expect you?
3663724 3665214 Oh, about 7:00.
3666227 3667216 Hey.
3681755 3682744 Hey...
3684724 3688387 You know how I said that stuff<br />on TV didn't bother me none?
3688461 3689621 Yeah.
3692465 3693727 It did.
3704044 3707536 Listen, the reason I brought you here<br />is because, uh...
3707614 3710344 I wanna know if you got any money<br />for training expenses, eh?
3710417 3711975 I got a few dollars.
3712052 3714452 A few bucks? Well, here.<br />Put this in your glove.
3714521 3717285 - What's this?<br />- 500 bucks. Don't worry about it.
3718758 3720589 You know, you ain't never<br />had any luck,
3720660 3724528 but I think this time Lady Luck may be<br />in your corner. What do you think?
3724598 3726259 Maybe. Maybe.
3726333 3728198 Hey, thanks for the money,<br />Tony, you know.
3728268 3730668 It's okay. Don't worry about it.<br />See ya, all right?
3731905 3733395 - Hey, wait a minute.<br />- What?
3733473 3735407 You're in training, huh?<br />Come on.
3735475 3736533 Hey.
3743984 3745576 - Yo, Tony.<br />- What?
3746186 3748518 You gonna show up at the fight?
3748588 3749850 Ringside.
3749923 3751083 Hey, ey.
3752425 3753585 I'll see ya.
3788962 3790054 Yeah?
3795669 3799571 Hello, kid. I seen your light.<br />Can I come in?
3799639 3801470 - Yeah, sure.<br />- Yeah, good.
3801541 3804032 Hey, it's a nice place here.
3804110 3808046 All right, anyway,<br />what I come to tell you is that, uh...
3808815 3812216 that what happened to you<br />is freak luck.
3812285 3815777 - Yeah, freak luck.<br />- Ain't it true? Look at the other guys.
3815855 3819416 Now, they're good fighters, right?<br />They're colorful, they got good records.
3819492 3822154 They fight their guts out<br />for peanuts.
3822228 3825959 But you...<br />you get a shot at the title.
3826032 3827693 Freak luck is a strange thing.
3827767 3829997 Yeah, sure it is.<br />Can I sit down?
3830070 3831230 Yeah, sure.
3832339 3833829 What the hell are those?
3833907 3835636 Oh, those are domestic turtles.
3835709 3838405 The one on the top is Cuff<br />and the other guy's Link.
3838478 3839968 The rest of them are marbles.
3840046 3842276 Yeah? They make good soup,<br />don't they?
3843350 3848845 Anyway, look... I'm here to warn ya<br />that you gotta be very careful
3848922 3851857 about this shot<br />that you got at the title,
3851925 3854587 because, I don't know,<br />like the Bible says...
3854661 3856993 you ain't gonna get<br />a second chance.
3857063 3859054 Yeah. All right.
3859132 3860963 You thought of that, huh?
3861034 3865130 Well, what you need<br />is a manager.
3865205 3867366 A manager.<br />Listen to me.
3867440 3871035 I know because I've been<br />in this racket for 50 years.
3871111 3872510 - 50 years, huh?<br />- 50 years.
3872579 3875912 God, I've seen it all.<br />All of it.
3875982 3877973 - You know what I done?<br />- What?
3878051 3879985 I have done it all.
3880053 3883784 You shoulda seen me when I<br />knocked Giny Russo outta the ring.
3883857 3887918 Outta the goddamn ring.<br />That's, uh, September the 14th, 1923.
3887994 3892158 And it was the same night that Firpo<br />knocks Dempsey outta the ring.
3892232 3894894 The same night. So, who gets<br />the publicity? Figure that out.
3894968 3896629 - Dempsey.<br />- That's right. But why?
3896703 3901003 - 'Cause he was Champ.<br />- No! Because he had a manager.
3901074 3903065 I had nothin', man.
3903810 3906301 I wanna show you somethin'.<br />Look at my face for a minute.
3906379 3909780 Look at this.<br />I got 21 stitches over this left eye.
3909849 3912443 I got 34 stitches over this eye.
3912519 3916114 You know what?<br />I had my nose busted 17 times.
3916189 3920353 The last time was<br />with that fight with Sailor Mike.
3920427 3923487 I got that clip in here.<br />That was a good fight.
3923563 3924894 You wanna read that?
3925732 3927723 You... oh, it doesn't matter.
3927801 3931293 Anyway, he put this vegetation<br />on my ear.
3932405 3935897 Ah, Rocky Marciano.
3936743 3940804 You know, you kinda remind me<br />of the Rock, you know that?
3940880 3942040 You really think so?
3942115 3946643 That's right. You move like him,<br />and you got heart like he did.
3946719 3950485 Yeah, I got heart,<br />but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?
3953927 3955758 Uh... anyway,
3955829 3959162 you know, when I begun<br />in this business, kid...
3960733 3965067 Look, kid, I wanna make a suggestion.<br />Don't drink that piss before a fight.
3965138 3966969 You know, it's no good for you.
3967974 3969965 If you don't mind my sayin'.
3970043 3971977 Anyway, you know,<br />when I started this racket,
3972045 3974206 pugs like us,<br />we was treated like dogs.
3974280 3976771 For ten bucks,<br />you gotta tear somebody's throat out.
3976850 3979785 But I never had no management.<br />You know...
3980420 3983583 One time,<br />this... this son of a bitch that I fought,
3983656 3985647 he put a nail right there.
3985725 3987886 - Thumb.<br />- The thumb, yeah. In the glove.
3987961 3990293 And he punched<br />so many holes in my face.
3990363 3993491 I had the spit<br />shootin' out of my cheeks.
3993633 3994964 Can you imagine that?
3995635 3999298 Anyway, I'll tell ya what I looked like<br />when I was, uh, in my prime.
3999372 4002341 I want you to look at some...<br />will you look at that? Look at that.
4002408 4006469 That's the way I looked...<br />before these guys got at me.
4006546 4010539 That's nice. You take very<br />good care of the picture, though.
4010617 4011948 But I never had...
4012018 4014350 I never had no management...<br />that's the trouble!

4021494 4025294 I wanna make sure that all this shit that<br />happened to me doesn't happen to you.
4025365 4026855 You know what I mean?
4027700 4029190 The fight's set.
4029269 4031567 Listen to me.<br />I wanna be your manager.
4031638 4035734 - You follow that, do you?<br />- The fight's set. I don't need a manager.
4035808 4037799 But you can't buy<br />what I'm gonna give you.
4037877 4039970 I mean, I've got pain<br />and I've got experience.
4040046 4042810 Well, I got pain<br />and I got experience, too.
4043650 4045015 Listen, kid...
4045084 4047143 - Hey, yo. Hey, Mick.<br />- What?
4047220 4050155 I needed your help about<br />ten years ago, right? Ten years ago?
4050223 4052555 - Right.<br />- You never helped me. You didn't care.
4052625 4054616 Well, if you wanted help...
4054694 4057026 I say, if you wanted help,<br />why didn't you ask?
4057096 4058927 Why didn't you<br />just ask me, kid?
4058998 4061558 <i>Look, I asked,</i><br /><i>but you never heard nothin'!</i>
4062602 4063864 Well, I...
4065538 4067130 I, uh...

4111985 4113976 Took you long enough to get here.
4115021 4117182 Took you ten years<br />to come to my house?
4117257 4119418 Huh, what's the matter?<br />You don't like my house?
4120226 4121557 Does my house stink?
4122662 4124391 That's right... it stinks!
4124464 4127456 <i>I didn't have no favors from you!</i>
4127533 4129262 <i>Don't slum around me!</i>
4130003 4132403 Talkin' about your prime.
4132472 4134463 What about my prime, Mick?!
4134540 4136371 <i>At least you had a prime!</i>
4137477 4139536 I didn't have no prime.<br />I didn't have nothin'!
4139612 4142604 Leg's are goin', everything is goin',<br />Nobody's gettin' no nothin'.
4142682 4144843 Guy comes up, offers me a fight.<br />Big deal.
4144917 4147613 Wanna fight the fight?<br />Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.
4147687 4151453 <i>I wouldn't wanna fight. Know what's</i><br /><i>gonna happen to me? I'm gonna get that!</i>
4151524 4152923 I'm gonna get that!

4158965 4161627 <i>Huh? Do you wanna see me</i><br /><i>get my face kicked in?!</i>
4161701 4163532 <i>Legs ain't workin',</i><br /><i>nothing's workin',</i>
4163603 4166128 <i>but they go.</i><br /><i>"Go on, fight the champ."</i>
4166639 4167970 Yeah, I'll fight him.
4170910 4172639 Get my face kicked in.
4173579 4176173 And you come around here.<br />You wanna move in here with me?!
4176249 4178183 Come on in!<br />It's a nice house!
4179052 4182044 Real nice.<br />Come on in and move. It stinks!
4183122 4184953 This whole place stinks.
4185758 4189250 <i>You wanna help me out?</i><br /><i>Well, help me out!</i>
4189329 4191593 <i>Come on, help me out.</i><br /><i>I'm standin' here!</i>
4251424 4254587 <i>It's only about 28 degrees.</i><br /><i>We'll check that forecast in just a minute.</i>
4254660 4257925 <i>I feel very mischievous.</i><br /><i>Very weird. Very...</i>
4258765 4261165 <i>Well, the thing is,</i><br /><i>I got vinyl seats in my car.</i>
4261234 4264294 <i>When I hit the seats this morning,</i><br /><i>I just went. "Whew!"</i>
4264370 4266429 <i>I'm thinkin', if I'm up,</i>
4266506 4269669 <i>everybody in the Delaware Valley</i><br /><i>should be up. Do you agree with me?</i>
4269742 4273075 <i>I mean, at three minutes past 4:00,</i><br /><i>what else are you gonna do?</i>
4275648 4277479 <i>- Hello?</i><br /><i>- Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.</i>
4277550 4280212 <i>This is Don Cannon,</i><br /><i>W-I-B-G Philadelphia.</i>
4280286 4281776 <i>- How are you this morning?</i><br /><i>- Huh?</i>
4281854 4283185 <i>- Mrs. Kramer?</i><br /><i>- What?!</i>
4283256 4287920 <i>I think you have a lot of nerve calling me</i><br /><i>at this hour in the morning! Goodbye!</i>
4288761 4295166 <i>W-I-B-G</i>
4295234 4300695 <i>Philadelphia</i>
4301374 4303638 <i>Me and Mrs. Kramer are up,</i><br /><i>and it's a good morning.</i>
4303709 4307873 <i>I tell ya, I need someone to snuggle with,</i><br /><i>28 degrees. It's cold out there.</i>
4307947 4310939 <i>We deserve it. We've been getting away</i><br /><i>with murder the last couple weeks.</i>
4311017 4313417 <i>Our high today could possibly</i><br /><i>be 58, and that's it.</i>
4313486 4315977 <i>Tonight we're back down</i><br /><i>on the 20 degree range,</i>
4316055 4319718 <i>a little colder in the suburbs,</i><br /><i>and tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,</i>
4319792 4321123 <i>we may hit 40 somewhere.</i>
4321194 4323025 <i>But it's 28, it's awfully chilly.</i>
4323095 4326155 <i>Make sure you have it</i><br /><i>snuggled on before you bring it out.</i>
4468040 4469371 Come on.
4470209 4472700 Stinks in... hey, come on.<br />It stinks in here, you know.
4472778 4474837 Yeah... I know.
4476582 4478413 Hey, did you kill all these things?
4479418 4481249 No. Across the street.
4483623 4485955 This place is like<br />an animal morgue, you know?
4486659 4489321 - It's a little cold in here, ain't it?<br />- Yeah.
4494233 4495894 Who killed all these things?
4496702 4498192 What, are you crazy, Paulie?
4498270 4500534 If you don't pay Gazzo,<br />you end up on the hook.
4500606 4502938 Come on, Gazzo's a good man.<br />You know that.
4503009 4504840 Hey, don't get excited.<br />I know that.
4504910 4508744 That's why I want you to talk to him<br />about me... the collectin' job.
4508814 4511214 Get me out<br />of this stinkin' freezer.
4511283 4512944 Why don't you do yourself a favor?
4513019 4515852 Why don't you keep this job,<br />because you eat better, you know?
4517123 4518613 Moo.
4518691 4520283 Does it ever snow in here?
4521460 4524122 Uh... you and my sister.
4524196 4526027 How you gettin' along together?
4526699 4527859 How do you think?
4528734 4531999 Well, I'm not sure, Rock.<br />What's the story?
4532071 4534005 About what?
4534073 4536473 What's the story?<br />What's happening?
4536542 4538271 Do you really like her?
4538344 4539675 Sure, I like her.
4542048 4544312 I don't see it.<br />What's the attraction?
4545685 4549177 I don't know.<br />It fills gaps, I guess.
4549255 4551917 - What's gaps?<br />- I don't know. Gaps.
4551991 4555791 She's got gaps, I got gaps.<br />Together, we fill gaps. I don't know.
4557630 4559029 You ballin' her?
4559765 4560823 Hey.
4561467 4563958 Hey, you don't talk dirty<br />about your sister.
4565805 4567830 Are you screwin' my sister?
4570543 4574138 You see? That's why I can't connect<br />you with Gazzo, you know that, Paulie?
4574213 4577842 Because you got a big mouth,<br />you know. You just talk too much.
4577917 4580078 It's gettin' cold in here.<br />I'm going home.
4580152 4583053 Cold in here?!<br />It is cold in here!
4583122 4585283 It stinks in here,<br />and you stink!
4613919 4616080 Hey, you're breakin' the ribs.
4635574 4639066 If you do that to Apollo Creed,<br />they'll put us in jail for murder.
4641614 4643605 I'll see ya tomorrow morning, okay?
4656495 4658827 - I turned the heat up.<br />- Thanks.
4659498 4663662 You know, your brother's a good man,<br />but he's awful pushy, you know?
4673445 4676778 - You want me to rub you down?<br />- No, I'm just... I'm just sore, okay?
4676849 4678339 I'll just... just sit here.
4678417 4680578 - You sure?<br />- Yeah, I'm sure.
4684323 4686655 Hey, come on.<br />No foolin' around, all right?
4687493 4688653 I'm tired.
4689562 4691553 Hey, Adrian,<br />I'm serious now.
4691630 4695122 There's no foolin' around during training,<br />understand? I wanna stay strong.
4695801 4698133 - You're not kiddin'?<br />- No, I ain't kiddin'.
4701640 4703301 - You sure?<br />- Yeah, I'm sure.
4703375 4705707 Listen, why don't you<br />just make the meat, okay?
4708347 4709837 Okay, I'll make the meat.
4734106 4735266 Yo.
4736909 4739070 - It's okay.<br />- I'm sorry.
4739678 4740736 Hey.
4765271 4767603 Right, right.<br />Left, left.
4769408 4771069 Underneath.<br />Come on, underneath.
4771744 4774577 Underneath, underneath,<br />underneath. Come on!
4774647 4775978 Hold it. Hold it.
4776048 4778539 Hold it, Rock, will ya?<br />You drive me crazy.
4778617 4780949 You're so sloppy<br />because you're off balance.
4781020 4784183 Let's try this. Now, take this string.<br />Tie it to both ankles.
4784256 4786087 Leave about two feet of slack.
4786158 4787750 I ain't never had good footwork.
4787826 4789817 Never mind footwork.<br />Now you're all balanced.
4789895 4794889 Marciano had the same problem,<br />and this string cured it.
4794967 4796127 Here's the idea...
4796201 4799762 that if you can move and you can hit<br />without breaking the string,
4799838 4800998 you got balance.
4801073 4803200 You become<br />a very dangerous person.
4803275 4805266 - You follow?<br />- You're lookin' good, Rock.
4805344 4806675 - Thanks.<br />- Let's go.
4806745 4808406 That's it. That's it.<br />Underneath.
4808480 4810072 - Hey, Rock.<br />- What?
4810149 4812549 - How 'bout you give us your autograph?<br />- Get outta here!
4812618 4815553 Don't you ever interrupt me<br />while I'm conducting business.
4815621 4818055 Move your little<br />chicken asses out of here.
4818123 4822457 Listen, kid. You!<br />You lay off that pet shop dame.
4822528 4825156 Women weaken legs.
4826165 4828429 Yeah, but I really like<br />this girl, you know?
4828500 4830331 Then let her train ya!
4833138 4836699 - Okay, no more foolin' around.<br />- Okay. Now hit it.
4838410 4840674 Women weaken legs, huh?
4845184 4847015 - Yo, Rock.<br />- Yo, Rocky.
4853726 4854784 Yo.
4856295 4857353 Yo.
4857429 4859124 Yo, you look great.
4859965 4861796 - Really?<br />- Oh, yeah.
4861867 4864961 Terrific. I mean,<br />you could be a heartbreaker.
4865037 4866698 You'll walk down the street<br />breaking hearts,
4866772 4868831 the way you're lookin'...<br />very sharp.
4868907 4871341 I got... I got another surprise for you.
4871410 4872570 What?
4873412 4878042 Hey, Butkus! Hey, Butkus!<br />Come here, kid! Come here!
4878117 4879744 To keep you company<br />when you run.
4885324 4888259 Come on in and meet the family.<br />The owner ever come back?
4888327 4891455 - He's yours. He's yours if you want him.<br />- Do I want him? Come here!
4891530 4893361 What's he eat... this dog?
4893432 4896265 - He eats little turtles.<br />- Yo, Butkus!
4919858 4923760 What's that, Butkus, huh?<br />Whose truck is this? Come on.
4925998 4928330 One call from me,<br />you're a celebrity.
4930702 4933637 - You're gonna need exposure.<br />- Oh, don't breathe on me, Paulie!
4933705 4936196 That's the big time!<br />Don't I know about these things?
4936275 4938505 You don't know nothin'!<br />What do these guys want from me?
4938577 4940238 To watch you train! Boom.
4940312 4942974 What is the matter with you, Paulie?<br />This was supposed to be private.
4943048 4945642 - I'm doin' you a favor!<br />- You ain't doin' me no favors!
4945717 4947378 You're embarrassin' me<br />in front of everybody,
4947453 4949853 you make me look bad<br />in front of your sister...
4949922 4953756 You see this cigar? I'll stick it<br />in your ear. Don't do these things to me!
4953826 4956317 You should've called me up<br />or something... leave a message.
4956395 4958056 Don't do that!
4958130 4959859 My sister really likes you.
4961633 4964295 I'm gonna kill you one of these days,<br />I swear to God!
4964369 4965427 Come on. Come on.
4965504 4967631 - Baby!<br />- Baby.
4967706 4971437 Here he is, the next<br />heavyweight champ, Rocky Balboa!
4971510 4973000 Hi, there. Rocky Balboa.
4973078 4975672 Listen, we wanna get a brief interview<br />with you. It won't take long.
4975747 4977146 - What about me?<br />- What about you?
4977216 4979707 - I'm in charge of the meat.<br />- Fine. Will you stand behind it, please?
4979785 4981946 Listen, just settle yourself in.<br />Just relax.
4982020 4984853 What we're going to do is<br />just ask you a few questions, Rocky.
4984923 4987414 Just a few questions<br />about your unique training method.
4987493 4988824 Talk to the folks at home.
4988894 4991055 They really wanna know<br />how you got into this.
4991130 4992859 I mean, this isn't an everyday thing.
4992931 4994421 Jimmy, you guys ready?<br />Let's roll.
4994500 4996331 Rocky, why don't you turn<br />right around here.
4996401 4998392 Just don't take no cheap shots,<br />you know?
4998470 5000461 No, I won't do that.<br />Just relax, Rocky.
5000539 5003872 Today we're here with<br />heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.
5003942 5007275 - The reason we're standing...<br />- The meat guy's stickin' his face in.
5008413 5010574 Let's try it again, Rocky.
5010649 5014483 <i>Today we're here with</i><br /><i>heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.</i>
5014553 5016953 <i>The reason we're standing</i><br /><i>in this refrigerated box</i>
5017022 5020287 <i>is that Mr. Balboa has</i><br /><i>an unusual method of training.</i>
5020359 5022190 <i>In a moment,</i><br /><i>he's going to demonstrate that</i>
5022261 5023922 <i>for the viewing audience at home.</i>
5023996 5027989 <i>But first, Rocky, how did you</i><br /><i>come to train in an icebox?</i>
5028066 5030466 <i>Uh, well, my friend...</i><br /><i>the guy over there...</i>
5030536 5033596 <i>let me in one day and I hit</i><br /><i>the beef here and kinda liked it.</i>
5033672 5037335 <i>And since I become a challenger,</i><br /><i>the owner don't mind that I come in.</i>
5037409 5041470 <i>Is this a common training method?</i><br /><i>Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i>
5041547 5043378 <i>No, I think I invented it.</i>
5043448 5046781 Don't forget to confirm the reservation<br />for my people at ringside,
5046852 5048979 and be sure<br />to fly my barber to Philly.
5053192 5056025 How much is being channeled into<br />West Coast closed circuit advertising?
5056094 5058494 - $300,000.<br />- Make it 450.
5058564 5060725 And send the mayor's wife<br />200 roses from me,
5060799 5063859 and make sure we get a picture<br />of it for all the newspapers.
5063936 5066769 Do you wanna run<br />the 15 radio spots in the Midwest?
5066838 5069773 I think you could spend your money<br />better in Canadian publicity.
5069841 5072173 By the way... I've got<br />a couple of friends up in Toronto
5072244 5074337 who'd probably be able<br />to get you a good tax break.
5074413 5077143 George, I like your friends.
5084556 5086114 Hey, Champ...
5086191 5088785 you oughta come look at this boy<br />you're gonna fight on TV.
5089695 5091026 Looks like he means business.
5091096 5092757 Yeah, I mean business, too.
5093332 5095163 Shirley, we got<br />any more coffee out there?
5095234 5097634 Oh, certainly, Mr. Creed.<br />I'll get you some right away.
5097703 5100171 After the fight, I may just retire<br />and run for emperor.
5100973 5102907 The arena's<br />the only program concession,
5102975 5106968 and the gross rental of the arena<br />is gonna include the 400 ushers, right?
5115520 5120753 Diana Lewis, in the meat house<br />with southpaw Rocky Balboa.
5167406 5168930 And he called the reporters?
5169007 5171601 Yeah, it threw<br />my whole training schedule off.
5171677 5173975 Don't be mad at him.<br />He's just trying to help.
5174046 5177038 Adrian, I ain't mad,<br />it's just that, uh,
5177115 5179276 when a reporter's around,<br />I get out of joint
5179351 5182013 'cause they take cheap shots,<br />and Paulie knows that.
5182688 5185589 Paulie keeps askin' me<br />for a job all the time,
5185657 5188683 but he don't know nothin'<br />about fightin'.
5188760 5190489 Are you gonna say<br />anything to him?
5191930 5195161 What's to say? I just don't know<br />what he wants from me.
5197669 5199660 I don't want nothin' from you.
5200672 5202537 I don't want nothin' from you.
5203742 5206267 This ain't no charity case.
5206345 5207835 Get outta my house.
5207913 5209676 It's not just your house.
5210582 5212243 You ain't no friend no more.
5213085 5216316 - Get out of my house, I just says.<br />- Don't talk to him like that.
5216388 5218879 Both of you get out of my house.
5218957 5220481 Yo.

5232571 5234732 I don't want you messin' her,
5234806 5237536 and I don't raise you<br />to go with this scum bum!
5237609 5239372 Come on! Wanna hit on me?<br />Come on!
5239444 5242436 I'll break both your arms<br />so they don't work for ya!
5246151 5248642 That's right! I'm not good enough<br />to meet with Gazzo...
5248720 5249880 That's what I think of Gazzo!
5249955 5252355 Now you're a big-shot fighter<br />on your way up,
5252424 5254585 you don't even throw a crumb<br />to your friend Paulie!
5254659 5256923 When I go<br />and get you meat every morning!
5256995 5259657 You forgot that!<br />Then I even give you my sister, too!
5259731 5262894 - Only a pig would say that!<br />- I'm a pig?
5262968 5264697 A pig gives you the best?
5265704 5268366 You're such a loser!<br />I don't get married because of you!
5269574 5271804 You can't live by yourself!
5271877 5275369 I put you two together!<br />And you... don't you forget it!
5275447 5276937 You owe me!
5279551 5281712 - You owe me!<br />- What do I owe you?!
5281787 5284278 You're supposed<br />to be good to me.
5284356 5287689 What do I owe you, Paulie?!<br />What do I owe ya?!
5287759 5289420 I treat you good!
5289494 5292930 I cook for you, I clean for you,<br />I pick up your dirty clothes!
5292998 5296991 I take care of you, Paulie!<br />I don't owe you nothin'!
5297068 5299730 And you made me feel<br />like a loser!
5300639 5302470 I'm not a loser!
5302541 5304873 - You're busted!<br />- What?!
5304943 5306274 You're not a virgin!
5306845 5310337 You let him into your pants!<br />She's busted!
5313819 5315753 I can't haul meat no more!
5346251 5347741 You want a roommate?
5352791 5354281 Absolutely.
5356161 5358595 Okay, now, when you<br />walk into the ring
5358663 5361154 with the number one<br />heavyweight of the world,
5361233 5362825 you'll be ready, won't ya?
5362901 5368066 Why? Because I waited<br />for 50 years to make you ready.
5368139 5370972 You'll be able to spit nails, kid.
5371042 5373203 Like the guy says,<br />you're gonna eat lightning
5373278 5375212 and you're gonna crap thunder.
5375280 5378272 You're gonna become<br />a very dangerous person.
5378350 5380511 - Yo, Mickey.<br />- Hey! How are ya?
5380585 5384988 Oh, Rock. I want you to meet<br />our cutman here, Al Salvani.

5718389 5721916 Rocky.<br />What brings you here tonight?
5722994 5725462 Mr. Jergens,<br />the poster's wrong.
5725530 5726861 What do you mean?
5726931 5730264 Well, I'm wearin' white pants<br />with a red stripe.
5734239 5736571 It doesn't really matter,<br />does it?
5736641 5739007 I'm sure you're gonna give us<br />a great show.
5740578 5742569 Try to get some rest, kid.
5743481 5744743 Good night.
5836474 5838066 I can't do it.
5840979 5842139 What?
5843181 5844842 I can't beat him.
5846317 5847579 Apollo?
5848486 5849646 Yeah.
5850922 5854085 I've been out there<br />walkin' around, thinkin'.
5855827 5859228 I mean, who am I kiddin'?<br />I ain't even in the guy's league.
5864569 5865900 What are we gonna do?
5877615 5879014 I don't know.
5885656 5887317 You worked so hard.
5889260 5892752 It don't matter,<br />'cause I was nobody before.
5894832 5896129 Don't say that.
5897035 5899435 Oh, come on, Adrian.<br />It's true.
5899504 5901165 I was nobody.
5902907 5905068 But it don't matter either,<br />you know?
5906811 5908403 So, I was thinkin'...
5909881 5912714 It really don't matter<br />if I lose this fight.
5914619 5917782 It really don't matter<br />if this guy opens my head, either.
5919757 5922419 'Cause all I wanna do<br />is go the distance.
5927131 5929725 Nobody's ever<br />gone the distance with Creed.
5931102 5933434 And if I can go that distance...
5934739 5937970 ...see, if that bell rings<br />and I'm still standin'...
5942914 5946645 ...I'm gonna know<br />for the first time in my life, you see...
5948453 5951854 ...that I weren't just another bum<br />from the neighborhood.
6019190 6021249 Time, kid.<br />Let's go.
6023995 6025326 I'll wait for you here.
6028132 6030623 Or how 'bout I wait here<br />and you fight, huh?
6031836 6034327 You're lookin' very great today...<br />you know that?
6036974 6040307 I gotta go now, but, uh,<br />don't you leave town, huh?
6041479 6043470 Wish me luck.<br />I'm gonna need it.
6044649 6046139 Good luck.
6046717 6049880 Say, Adrian, you don't think<br />this robe is too baggy, huh?
6050421 6051479 Good luck.
6051556 6052887 Don't leave town.
6055793 6059490 <i>I'd like to have you meet my colleague</i><br /><i>workin' the fight with me... Stu Hansen.</i>
6059564 6060622 Thank you, Bill Baldwin.
6060698 6063826 The electricity is all over<br />the place tonight as Rocky Balboa...
6065469 6067130 Hey, what the hell is that?
6067205 6069605 I trained you to be a fighter,<br />not a billboard.
6069674 6072507 - I'm doin' it for a friend.<br />- What do you get out of it?
6072577 6074636 Paulie gets three grand,<br />I get the robe.
6074712 6075872 Shrewd.
6076581 6078981 The story about tonight's fight,<br />their difference in style,
6079050 6081211 you can quote a recent<br />sports magazine which said,
6081285 6083446 "Could be the caveman<br />against the cavalier."
6083521 6085921 I noticed a buzzing<br />in the background now, Bill.
6085990 6088322 <i>Could be the challengers</i><br /><i>getting ready to get into the ring.</i>
6088392 6091725 Rocky! Look at my date.<br />Cost me $200.
6091796 6094287 - 250.<br />- I gotta go. I gotta work.
6094365 6096356 - How's the robe?<br />- It's a little baggy.
6096934 6099767 <i>A 50 to 1 underdog</i><br /><i>living a Cinderella story,</i>
6099837 6103238 <i>and he's captured people's</i><br /><i>imaginations all over the world.</i>
6107979 6109571 We love you, Rocky!
6109647 6112707 - Good luck, champ.<br />- Hey, thanks for showin' up.
6113351 6115182 <i>And his record... 44 victories.</i>
6115253 6118245 <i>He's got 38 by knockout,</i><br /><i>and he's lost 20 fights.</i>
6118322 6120586 <i>Which makes me wonder,</i><br /><i>can he stand it...</i>
6120658 6123058 <i>the stamina and the skill</i><br /><i>to last the three rounds?</i>
6123127 6125391 <i>Because Las Vegas odds say no.</i>
6125463 6128864 <i>Rocky Balboa</i><br /><i>climbing into the ring now.</i>
6128933 6130594 The Italian Stallion.
6130668 6132932 <i>Some meat sign</i><br /><i>on the back of his robe there.</i>
6133004 6135666 <i>Have you seen what that was?</i><br /><i>Shamrock Meats, Inc.</i>
6136507 6140341 <i>A lot of noise coming from the back.</i><br /><i>You could go deaf with that noise.</i>
6140411 6142106 <i>You have the spotlights.</i>
6143281 6146444 <i>Is that the world</i><br /><i>heavyweight champion Apollo Creed?</i>
6146517 6149008 <i>He's in a boat... riding in a boat.</i>
6149086 6150815 <i>Is he supposed</i><br /><i>to be George Washington?</i>
6150888 6154051 <i>Obviously so. He's got the hat on,</i><br /><i>the whole thing. Look at that.</i>
6154125 6155615 <i>It's been confirmed.</i>
6155693 6157524 <i>The world champion Apollo Creed</i>
6157595 6160428 <i>is doing an imitation</i><br /><i>of George Washington.</i>
6162166 6163827 <i>- He's throwing money.</i><br /><i>- I don't believe it.</i>
6163901 6167268 <i>Remember we were talking about</i><br /><i>George Washington throwing the dollar?</i>
6167338 6168464 <i>Throwing the dollar.</i>
6168539 6171599 <i>'Course, if you threw a dollar</i><br /><i>in those days, it went a lot farther.</i>
6171676 6173337 <i>Oh, he's taking his...</i>
6173411 6175675 <i>White wig came off,</i><br /><i>the hat came off.</i>
6180017 6182679 <i>And the crowd is loving</i><br /><i>every minute of it... look at that.</i>
6182753 6184584 Here is the world<br />heavyweight champion.
6184655 6186589 Apollo Creed...<br />for you around the world
6186657 6189888 he was dressed as George Washington,<br />the father of our country.
6189960 6191450 I want you!
6195566 6197898 <i>Oh! Look at that!</i><br /><i>Uncle Sam himself.</i>
6197968 6199663 I want you!
6199737 6201068 All of you!
6201138 6203003 <i>"All of you." he's saying.</i>
6203074 6204939 He looks like a big flag.
6205009 6207500 I want you.<br />You.
6207578 6210138 - Is he talkin' to me?<br />- He's talkin' to you.
6210314 6212976 - Is he talkin' to me?<br />- Let him talk while he can talk.
6213050 6214711 I want the Stallion!
6215386 6217650 <i>He says, "I want the Stallion.</i><br /><i>I want the Stallion."</i>
6219123 6222286 <i>In foreign countries,</i><br /><i>during WWI,</i>
6222360 6225295 <i>there was the picture of Uncle Sam</i><br /><i>with his finger pointed like that.</i>
6225363 6228423 <i>A recruiting poster for our fellows</i><br /><i>in the service... the Army and the Navy.</i>
6228499 6231491 <i>- "I want you."</i><br /><i>- That's what he's doing a take of.</i>
6231569 6233537 <i>- There he is.</i><br /><i>- That's it, Creed.</i>
6233604 6235162 <i>Creed in three.</i>
6235239 6237139 What do you think<br />that outfit cost?
6247685 6249846 <i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
6250821 6252311 <i>Good evening.</i>
6252390 6254722 <i>A very happy New Year.</i>

6391562 6394224 You, chump.<br />I want you!
6394298 6397461 You boys both fought in Philadelphia<br />before, and you know the rules.
6397535 6400561 No low blows,<br />watch your heads, no butting.
6400638 6402128 Shake hands now<br />and come out fightin'.
6402206 6403935 Put your hands up there, chump.
6404008 6405999 - Come out fightin'.<br />- Come on. Come on.

6419456 6422619 <i>I've never seen a fighter</i><br /><i>that concerned about his hair.</i>
6431869 6433530 <i>And there's the bell</i><br /><i>for round one.</i>
6434905 6438068 <i>The fighters come into the center</i><br /><i>of the ring, looking at each other.</i>
6438142 6439473 <i>Rocky just looking.</i>
6439543 6444947 <i>The Champion gives one</i><br /><i>of the left-handed jabs right there.</i>
6446584 6450076 <i>The Champ's stinging,</i><br /><i>the slower challenger jabs at will.</i>
6450154 6454147 <i>In fact, it just looks like Rocky's</i><br /><i>blocking the blows with his face.</i>
6454224 6456556 <i>The Champion doesn't look</i><br /><i>the best he's ever been,</i>
6456627 6458322 <i>but he's really moving now.</i>
6458395 6460556 <i>Well, the Champion</i><br /><i>is smiling now.</i>
6460631 6462030 <i>He's toying with this man.</i>
6463000 6464991 Trying to give the fans<br />their money's worth.
6467705 6470868 <i>He's very clearly outdoing</i><br /><i>the challenger right now.</i>
6471709 6473540 I'll get you. Come on.
6473611 6477445 <i>He's just trying to make this man</i><br /><i>make him... see! Make him miss like that.</i>
6478949 6481440 <i>Oh, the Champ</i><br /><i>is just taunting him now.</i>
6484655 6486145 <i>He's dancing around.</i>
6487658 6489558 <i>I don't believe it!</i>
6489627 6491925 <i>- The Champ is down.</i><br /><i>- Yes, he is!</i>

6507945 6511210 Six... seven... eight.
6511281 6513977 <i>Appears to be all right.</i><br /><i>A little glassy-eyed, but okay.</i>
6515886 6518946 Let's go to work right now, Rock!<br />Come on!
6520224 6523557 <i>Now Rocky coming back out,</i><br /><i>and he's like a bull in a china closet.</i>
6523627 6524958 <i>He really wants it.</i>
6527164 6528825 <i>Boy, the Champion's</i><br /><i>coming back.</i>
6528899 6532062 <i>He's coming off the floor now,</i><br /><i>and he's trying...</i>
6532136 6534798 <i>A left, a right, another left,</i><br /><i>another right, combination!</i>
6534872 6537705 <i>Into the face!</i><br /><i>And that's the Apollo we know.</i>
6541679 6543010 <i>Now he's taunting him.</i>
6543080 6545173 <i>He's taunting Rocky.</i><br /><i>"Come on, let's go."</i>
6545249 6546614 <i>Left. There's another left.</i>
6547484 6548542 <i>Another left.</i>
6550387 6552150 <i>There!</i>
6553624 6555956 <i>Left and right.</i><br /><i>Rocky's got him on the rope!</i>
6556026 6557186 Come on.
6557261 6558592 Okay, break.
6558662 6560323 Punch. Hit me. Hit me.
6564001 6567164 <i>I tell you, there's no way we expected</i><br /><i>this kind of hitting from him.</i>
6567237 6569432 <i>Oh, no way,</i><br /><i>but with the ability of the Champion...</i>
6574244 6577236 <i>Apollo unloading a left, really</i><br /><i>trying to get him up against the ropes.</i>
6586056 6588581 <i>They're leading him over to his corner.</i><br /><i>Rocky can hardly find his way.</i>
6588659 6590752 <i>He's sitting down now.</i>
6590828 6592523 I told ya! I told ya!
6592596 6593927 Your nose is broke.
6593997 6596363 - How's it look?<br />- Ah, it's an improvement.
6596433 6599800 I want you to quit chuckin' and jivin'.<br />I want you to stick and move.
6599870 6603362 Go for the ribs.<br />Don't let that bastard breathe.
6603440 6604839 The guy's great.
6604908 6608901 He doesn't know it's a damn show.<br />He thinks it's a damn fight.
6608979 6611573 Finish this bum and let's go home.
6612082 6614915 Stay to the body. The body!<br />You're doing great!
6618555 6620216 <i>Creed got knocked down</i><br /><i>at the end of the first.</i>
6620290 6623885 <i>He came back strong at the end</i><br /><i>of the first, but he's working hard.</i>
6623961 6627124 <i>A smart left.</i><br /><i>Another left and a right.</i>
6627197 6629722 <i>And now coming</i><br /><i>into the corner again.</i>
6636640 6639905 <i>Oh, Balboa's taking</i><br /><i>a tremendous beating here.</i>
6645149 6647083 Oh, come on, man. Can't you fight?
6647151 6650143 Stop clownin' around here<br />and give these people something to see.
6651889 6653379 <i>He says he wants him!</i>
6654491 6658655 <i>If you folks aren't aware... you're</i><br /><i>watching a battle... I tell you that.</i>
6663167 6664532 <i>Balboa trying to fight back.</i>
6664601 6666762 <i>Oh! He tagged the Champ</i><br /><i>with a tremendous hook!</i>
6666837 6669169 <i>The Champion is trying</i><br /><i>to get himself out of there,</i>
6669239 6670797 <i>but he just can't do it.</i>
6670874 6674002 <i>He is being barraged with lefts</i><br /><i>and rights to the head, to the body.</i>
6674077 6678036 <i>Balboa is smacking the Champion</i><br /><i>right on the kisser.</i>
6678882 6682443 <i>And the referee's... they're ready</i><br /><i>to keep going. Look at that!</i>
6682519 6684953 - Back to your corner.<br />- Put that chump back in his corner.
6685022 6687718 - Come on, Creed.<br /><i>- Balboa doesn't want to quit. Hey.</i>
6687791 6689383 <i>This is gonna be a tough one.</i>
6744014 6746346 <i>Now he's got him. A left.</i>
6756526 6758790 <i>A hard left</i><br /><i>and a right combination.</i>
6758862 6761626 <i>What is keeping him up, Bill?</i><br /><i>I don't know.</i>
6764401 6766596 <i>He can't even get his gloves up</i><br /><i>to protect himself.</i>
6766670 6768501 <i>He needs to stop, Bill.</i>
6774411 6776743 Down! Down!<br />Stay down!
6776813 6779145 <i>Apollo dancing around</i><br /><i>with his arms in the air.</i>
6789893 6793158 ...five... six...
6794231 6797860 seven... eight... nine...
6807377 6809208 <i>Apollo can't believe it.</i>
6826363 6829696 <i>The Champion got a left</i><br /><i>to the ribs... his right rib.</i>
6829766 6831927 <i>Oh, this has been</i><br /><i>a tremendous...</i>
6837741 6840232 - Okay, Champ?<br />- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.
6840310 6843143 It hurts, though.<br />He broke my rib.
6843213 6845443 I can't see nothin'.<br />You gotta open my eye.
6845515 6847346 - Cut me, Mick.<br />- I don't wanna do it!
6847417 6850284 Go on, cut me.<br />Cut me.
6850354 6852083 Try it.
6856093 6857583 Oh, God.
6857661 6860095 You're bleeding inside, Champ.<br />I'm gonna stop the fight, understand?
6860163 6863564 You ain't stoppin' nothin', man.<br />You ain't stoppin' nothin'.
6863633 6866466 - You stop this fight, I'll kill ya.<br />- All right.
6866536 6870267 - Go if you wanna go.<br />- I'm goin'.
6870340 6873173 You gotta go.<br />You gotta give it all. Give it all!
6873243 6875404 You gotta get him.<br />You gotta work on that body.
6879850 6882842 <i>The crowd is on fire.</i><br /><i>The 15th and final round.</i>
6891595 6893995 <i>They look like they've been</i><br /><i>in a war... these two.</i>
6903140 6905631 <i>Oh, the Champion</i><br /><i>really tagged him!</i>
6905709 6909440 <i>And Apollo clearly protecting</i><br /><i>his right side... his ribs.</i>
6914818 6916410 <i>Hard left and right!</i>
6916486 6919978 <i>- Look at the blood coming from his face.</i><br /><i>- Oh, he's spitting up blood now.</i>
6923560 6926427 <i>A tremendous right hand by Rocky.</i>
6926496 6927963 Go for it! Go for it, Rock!
6928031 6930795 <i>Listen to this crowd!</i>
6930867 6934667 <i>Oh! Another to the rib.</i><br /><i>That left hand again right to the chin!</i>
6934738 6936535 <i>Oh! He's got him</i><br /><i>up against the ropes!</i>
6936606 6937664 <i>Apollo the Champ.</i>
6942112 6944945 Ain't gonna be no rematch.<br />Ain't gonna be no rematch.
6945649 6946809 Don't want one.
6957494 6960122 Rocky, you went the 15 rounds.<br />How do you feel?
6960197 6961255 I feel all right.
