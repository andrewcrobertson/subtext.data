907550 909674 So why didn't you break his thumb?
909804 913639 When you don't do what I tell you to do,<br />you make me look bad, Rock.
913770 918602 I figured... Look, if I break the guy's<br />thumb, he gets laid off, right? He can't...
918738 923487 Well, let me do the figurin', OK, Rock?<br />From here on, just let me do the figurin'.

1068845 1072012 It's Dipper's stuff.<br />It ain't your locker no more.
1074643 1078937 What you talkin' about? It's been my<br />locker for six years. Where's my gear?

1146069 1147895 - What?<br />- A tomato.
1148030 1152110 Yeah, let's face it. I run a business here,<br />not a goddamn soup kitchen.

1166638 1171348 You got heart, but you fight like a<br />goddamn ape. Nothin' special about you.
1171477 1176519 You never got your nose busted. Leave it<br />that way, and what's left of your mind.
1176651 1179486 Mick, I think I'll go take a steam.<br />You know why?

1271898 1275682 I must've had 20 bucks taken<br />outta there in the past six years.
1275820 1278061 It don't sound like much, but it adds up.

1297056 1299843 Do you need somebody<br />to walk you home, you know?
1299977 1301471 No.
1301604 1305471 It's a cold night. If I was you and<br />you got the money, I would take a cab.
1305608 1308229 Too many creeps around here, you know?
1308362 1312906 Every other block there's a creep.<br />You can always tell a creep.

1419590 1422128 - You caught me in a bad mood.<br />- You always are.
1422260 1425593 - Adrian ain't sharp. Adrian is a loser.<br />- Hey!

1488428 1492592 The greatest sportin' event in the<br />country's history. A gala occurrence.
1492726 1497353 - I'll beat him like he committed a crime.<br />- Would you take a look at that guy?
1497482 1500767 Where are the real fighters<br />gonna come from, the pros?
1500903 1503572 All we got today are jig clowns.
1505743 1508530 - Clown?<br />- That's right, clown.
1508663 1511284 In keeping with great events<br />in our history...

1522681 1525682 Be a doctor, be a lawyer,<br />carry a leather briefcase.
1525810 1529261 Forget sports as a profession.<br />Sports make you grunt and smell.

1532819 1535357 Are you crazy?<br />He's champion of the world.

1540579 1543995 Hey, Rocky, if you're not<br />happy with your life, that's nice.
1544125 1547376 But I got a business goin'.<br />I don't have to take no shots.
1547505 1552002 ... no one having gone more than 12<br />rounds with him, and that was Jake...
1552136 1556549 - Stick that up your business.<br />- What are you so insulted about?
1556683 1561013 You want me to take a shot?<br />All right, I'll take a shot!
1574581 1577250 - Hey, Rocky, how about a bottom?<br />- No wine, man.
1577377 1581422 Come on! Just a little.<br />You're makin' a lot of money.
1581549 1583921 Marie,<br />does your brother know you're out?
1584052 1588097 - Screw you, yo-yo!<br />- These guys teach you to talk like that?
1588224 1592056 - Stuff it, man!<br />- Don't you say that to me. Come here!
1592188 1594595 Stick up on it!
1594732 1596890 Swivel on it, ya bum!
1597027 1599066 Hey, you know, when I was your age...
1599196 1604535 ...there was one girl in the neighbourhood<br />who talked like that, you know? Just one.
1604662 1607580 What you doin'?<br />That'll make your teeth yellow.
1607707 1610661 - I like yellow teeth.<br />- And your breath like garbage.
1610795 1613749 - Maybe I like garbage.<br />- C'mon, nobody likes garbage.
1613882 1616207 Anyway, this girl wasn't bad-looking...
1616344 1618835 ...but guys never took her serious,<br />you see?
1618972 1621297 - They never took her out for a date.<br />- Why?
1621434 1624601 Guys laugh when you talk dirty.<br />They think you're cute.
1624730 1628181 If you get a reputation,<br />you get no respect, you understand?
1628317 1631899 You get no respect.<br />I gotta use a bad word.
1632030 1634402 Whore. You understand? Whore.
1634534 1638698 You see, if you use dirty words,<br />you maybe end up becomin' a whore.
1639249 1642949 - Come on, Rocky. I'm 12.<br />- Hey, that don't matter you're 12.
1643086 1648211 You don't really have to be one.<br />You just act like one, and that's it - boom!
1648343 1650382 You get a bad rep, you understand?
1650513 1654463 20 years from now, people are<br />gonna say "Do you remember Marie?"
1654601 1658551 "No, who was she?" "The whore that<br />hung down at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."
1658690 1661359 "Oh, yeah. Now I remember her."
1661485 1667191 You see, they don't remember you.<br />They remember the rep, you understand?
1667326 1669234 Hey, you got a boyfriend?
1669370 1672455 No, you ain't got a boyfriend.<br />You know why?
1672583 1676497 Why don't you? Because you hang out<br />with them coconuts on the corner.
1676630 1680129 You hang around with coconuts,<br />you get nowhere. They're lemons!
1680260 1683095 Hang out with nice people,<br />you get nice friends.
1683222 1685974 Hang out with smart people,<br />you get smart friends.
1686101 1689019 Hang out with yo-yo people,<br />you get yo-yo friends.
1689146 1692728 It's simple mathematics.<br />I hope you ain't gonna...
1692859 1694484 - I won't.<br />- What was I gonna say?
1694612 1697779 You hope I stop actin'<br />like a whore or I'll turn into one.
1697908 1700149 - Somethin' like that.<br />- Night, Rocky.
1700285 1702610 - Night, Marie. Take care.<br />- Hey, Rocky.
1702747 1705238 - Yo?<br />- Screw you, creepo!
1713177 1717091 Yeah, who are you to give advice, creepo?<br />Who are you?
1736290 1739623 - Are the doctor's reports confirmed?<br />- Definitely.
1739753 1745673 It says that Green has suffered a severely<br />cracked third metacarpal in his left hand.
1747221 1751219 We can cancel the fight indefinitely<br />if you're set on fighting Green.
1751352 1755813 Hey, it ain't just Green! What about<br />all the time Apollo has invested?
1755941 1758859 - I believe we can find a solution.<br />- Solution nothin'.
1758986 1761691 Find me another contender in a flash,<br />Jergens.
1761823 1766450 Don't play games with my client. He's<br />done a million dollars' worth of publicity...
1766580 1769415 ...and has made contractual obligations.
1769542 1773670 - He's not going to be embarrassed!<br />- I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.
1773797 1777877 - Ernie is fighting in France that week.<br />- Buddy Shaw. He's ranked fifth.
1778011 1783254 Went to California and gained 50 pounds.<br />I got hold of every worthwhile contender...
1783393 1787307 ...and they all say five weeks<br />isn't enough time to get into shape.
1787440 1791984 Shape nothin', man! They afraid! They<br />know everybody's gonna see the fight.
1792113 1794818 None of 'em can whip me.<br />They're makin' excuses...
1794949 1798153 ...so they don't get whipped<br />in front of the whole world.
1798287 1801241 All I can say is I'm a good promoter.
1801374 1804743 I've promoted fights<br />in every goddamn country in the world...
1804879 1809837 ...and I've broken my ass over this,<br />but I don't know what the hell else to do.
1814767 1816723 I do.
1818230 1822560 Without a ranked contender,<br />what this fight is gonna need is a novelty.
1822694 1825066 This is the land of opportunity, right?
1825197 1831319 So Apollo Creed on January 1 gives<br />a local underdog fighter an opportunity.
1831455 1835785 A snow-white underdog. And I'm gonna<br />put his face on this poster with me.
1835919 1837578 And I'll tell you why.
1837713 1842590 Because I'm sentimental,<br />like a lot of other people in this country.
1842720 1847098 There's nothing they'd like better than<br />to see Apollo Creed give a local boy...
1847225 1851175 ...a shot at the world title<br />on this country's biggest birthday.
1851315 1853806 Now that's the way I see it.
1853943 1856065 And that's the way it's gonna be.
1856196 1858271 Apollo, I like it!
1858406 1860813 It's very American.
1860952 1863823 No, Jergens. It's very smart.
1865040 1867495 (Jergens laughs)
1888446 1890853 - What is it?<br />- I just wanna check this out.
1890990 1894406 I pick up two yards from Snyder<br />and a grand from Cappoli?
1894537 1898535 No, no. Two yards from Cappoli<br />and a grand from Snyder.
1898666 1902035 - Two yards. Yeah, I got it.<br />- OK, write it down, OK?
1902171 1905789 Who's this girl you're<br />goin' out with tomorrow night?
1905926 1909011 - How d'you know?<br />- Don't you think I hear things?
1909139 1913802 - A lot of canaries flyin' around the docks.<br />- I'm goin' out with Paulie's sister.
1913937 1917721 - I hear she's retarded.<br />- She ain't retarded. She's shy, you know?
1917859 1922569 I'll tell you what to do. Take her to the zoo.<br />I hear retards like the zoo.
1922698 1925153 - This bum gotta say that?<br />- You callin' me a bum?
1925285 1928570 - I'm callin' you a bum!<br />- OK, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood.
1928706 1931161 - It's his prostate.<br />- He's always in a bad mood.
1931292 1934708 Count your blessings, Buddy.<br />You're still healthy.
1934838 1937163 - I don't like your face.<br />- I don't like yours!
1937300 1939173 - Kiss my ass!<br />- Move!
1939303 1944464 Relax! Relax! Relax! My ears! What,<br />are you drivin' me crazy? Both of ya's.
1946228 1950772 Buddy doesn't like ya. Some guys,<br />they just hate for no reason, you got me?
1950901 1952940 - Yeah.<br />- Come here.
1954031 1957151 There's 50 bucks.<br />You and Adrian, you have a nice time.
1957285 1959491 Thanks.
1959955 1964167 - Hey, how'd you know her name?<br />- You don't think I hear things?
1964794 1967795 - (Buddy) Remember what I told you.<br />- What'd you tell me?
1967923 1970164 Take her to the zoo!
1977310 1981224 - Some more coffee, Mr Creed?<br />- No thanks, Shirley.
1981357 1984442 - What do you think about Billy Snow?<br />- Fouls.
1985654 1987693 - How about Big Chuck Smith?<br />- Yeah.
1987824 1991691 No, he's too old and dull.<br />Hey, that Bobby Judge, he's a good boy.
1991829 1996954 - No, I don't feel the heat from that name.<br />- Joe Zack's a good prospect.
1997086 2000502 Exactly what are you lookin' for, Apollo?
2001175 2005220 This is what I'm lookin' for.<br />The Italian Stallion.
2006140 2008595 Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.
2008726 2011051 Look, it's the name, man.
2011187 2013939 The Italian Stallion.
2014066 2018812 The media'll eat it up. Now who<br />discovered America? An Italian, right?
2018948 2022399 What would be better than<br />to get it on with a descendant?
2022535 2025739 He's a southpaw.<br />I don't want you messin' with them.
2025873 2030831 - They do everything backwards.<br />- Southpaw nothin'! I'll drop him in three.
2030963 2035127 "Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion."
2036679 2038671 Sounds like a damn monster movie!
2038973 2042638 What are you doin' with that bat?<br />I used to be deadly at stickball.
2042770 2048144 - You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?<br />- Very excited. Look at my swollen hands.
2048277 2051610 The joints, from carrying meat<br />in and out of freezers.
2051740 2054944 - Plays hell on the joints.<br />- Maybe you oughta see a doctor.
2055078 2057651 I don't need a doctor.<br />I need a different job.
2057789 2061074 - What kind of turkey? Big or small?<br />- Talk to Gazzo about me.
2061211 2064745 Tell him I'm a good man<br />and nothin' bothers me.
2064881 2068581 I'd make a great collector.<br />Bustin' bones don't bother me.
2068720 2073631 A big turkey, right? Hey, forget Gazzo.<br />That's a bad job, you know what I mean?
2073768 2077267 - You got a match?<br />- Go to him for me, as a favour.
2077398 2080233 Yeah, yeah. Last time I had a turkey...
2080360 2086197 ...it was when they had a $2 special<br />at Horn & Hardart's about three years ago.
2094545 2099753 - Your sister knows I'm comin', for sure?<br />- Yeah, she's gonna be excited.
2102013 2104884 Hey, will you forget about Gazzo, huh?
2105017 2108386 - I don't ask nobody twice.<br />- You don't ask nobody twice.
2108522 2111393 # Stay away, baby
2113278 2119115 - You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very excited.
2121747 2124452 (Adrian) Paulie! You're late.
2124584 2129745 You called the hospital? She calls<br />the hospital if I'm ten minutes late.
2129883 2132124 (Rocky) Yo, how you doin'?
2132260 2134715 I told you she's very excited.
2137517 2139889 Why didn't you say<br />you were bringin' him?
2140020 2143602 - Look at me. I'm not ready.<br />- Would it make a difference if you were?
2143734 2147566 - He's a friend and he's takin' you out.<br />- No, I can't.
2147697 2151397 I want you outta the kitchen<br />and I want you out right now.
2151535 2153990 I won't.
2154122 2156909 Hey! Hey!
2157585 2160076 Hey, I want you outta here instamatically!
2160213 2165090 I'm sick of seein' you hangin' around<br />like a spider! Go out and live! Enjoy life!
2165220 2168802 - Paulie, I can't go!<br />- Don't get wise with me now.
2168933 2172800 - I'm tired of you bein' a loser.<br />- Don't call me that, Paulie!
2172938 2175856 (TV) Apollo Creed is<br />shopping for another "victim"...
2175983 2179850 ... to fill Green's vacancy for the<br />Bicentennial championship fight...
2179989 2182610 You didn't tell me<br />you were bringin' him home!
2182742 2185909 I'm not gonna go, Paulie!<br />I can't go! I won't go!
2186038 2188030 Why?
2188166 2192116 Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.<br />I got a turkey in the oven.
2192254 2195208 Oh. A turkey in the oven?
2195342 2197381 Oh.
2209820 2211728 You want the bird?
2211863 2214069 Go in the alley and eat the bird!
2214200 2216525 Oh, Paulie!
2216661 2219579 I want you outta here!<br />Get outta the house!
2219915 2222203 Go out and enjoy your freakin' life!
2226674 2229129 You hungry, Rock?
2234851 2238683 Hey, yo, Paulie. Maybe we'd just<br />better forget all this, you know?
2238815 2242100 - Just forget it.<br />- Forget nothin'. Say somethin' funny.
2242236 2245487 Ain't nothin' to say.<br />She's in a bad mood, I'm in a bad mood...
2245616 2248285 You know how to do funny.<br />Wanna go out with her?
2248411 2250866 - Yeah.<br />- Well...
2254126 2256795 - I don't know what to say.<br />- Funny.
2268728 2271266 Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky.
2271399 2273474 Rocky, you know?
2273610 2275649 Listen, uh...
2277198 2281659 I dunno what to say, cos I ain't never<br />talked to no door before, you know?
2282747 2287160 - I mean, what do I say to a door? Listen...<br />- Come on, you're doin' fine.
2287294 2289619 I ain't doin' fine. I look like an idiot.
2289755 2294085 Keep doin' what you're doin'.<br />Funny. I know all about these things.
2294220 2296259 I feel like a jerk.
2302147 2304602 Yo, Adrian. It's Rocky again, you know?
2304733 2306891 Listen, uh...
2307028 2309697 I know you ain't too happy<br />at this moment.
2309823 2314450 Well, could you do me a favour? I ain't<br />got nobody to spend Thanksgiving with.
2314579 2319656 So, uh, how about maybe you and I could<br />go out together and get somethin' to eat?
2319795 2322582 I don't know,<br />maybe laugh a little bit. Who knows?
2322715 2325170 Would you like to, uh...
2326178 2331339 I don't know. Would you like to maybe,<br />you know, you and me go out together?
2336608 2339181 We're gonna have a good time.
2339320 2342854 We'll have a real good time, you know?
2346120 2348575 Thanks for the bird.
2351419 2354504 I'm gonna turn the TV off.<br />I got a headache.
2366730 2369102 - What's your sister like to do?<br />- Ice-skate.
2369234 2374395 Adrian, come on, you're lettin' the heat<br />out. Who pays the bills around here?
2379080 2382780 Listen, uh, I don't want<br />no turkey anyway, you know?
2383878 2387578 - But it was Thanksgiving.<br />- It was what?
2387715 2392045 - It was Thanksgiving.<br />- Yeah, to you, but to me it's Thursday.
2416670 2419243 - Yo, looks kinda quiet.<br />- I think it's closed.
2419382 2422549 No, I think we're just early<br />or somethin' like that.
2422678 2423923 - Yo!<br />- Yo!
2424054 2426046 - We're closed!<br />- What?
2426182 2429017 - I said we're closed!<br />- Yeah. Hey, listen...
2429144 2432429 ...l'm gonna smooth this guy out.<br />Wait here for a few minutes.
2432566 2434854 - We could go someplace else.<br />- No, it's OK.
2434985 2438436 Are you closed to the general public<br />or closed to everybody?
2438573 2443070 It's after six o'clock. It's Thanksgiving.<br />That's why there's nobody here.
2443204 2447498 Besides, you ain't supposed to be in here,<br />so do me a favour and leave, huh?
2447627 2451577 - Could you do me a favour?<br />- Hey, come on, we're not operatin'.
2451715 2454467 Look... this girl here ain't feelin' well.
2454594 2459221 The doctor says she should exercise<br />and ice-skating's the best thing.
2459350 2463728 - Yeah? So what do you want from me?<br />- Do me a favour. She ain't feelin' good.
2463856 2467355 So if you could let her on the ice,<br />I'd appreciate it.
2467485 2471435 - Ten minutes, ten bucks.<br />- Ten bucks? How about eight bucks?
2471574 2473899 Come on! It's Thanksgiving.
2474035 2479196 - All right. Nine bucks, you got a deal.<br />- You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.
2480919 2482544 Gimme the blades.
2483465 2486585 - Aren't you skating?<br />- No, I ain't skated since I was 15.
2486719 2489126 That's when I started fightin'.
2489264 2492882 - Skating's bad for the ankles, you know?<br />- Yeah.
2493019 2495688 You're a pretty good skater, ain't ya?
2496649 2502106 Like I was sayin' on the way over, fightin'<br />used to be tops with me, but no more.
2502239 2504860 All I wanted to do was<br />prove I was no bum...
2504992 2507399 ...that I had the stuff to make a good pro.
2507537 2511155 - You never got the chance?<br />- I ain't cryin', cos I still fight.
2511293 2514792 I kinda do it like a hobby.<br />The trouble is, I'm a southpaw.
2514922 2517923 - What's a southpaw?<br />- It means you're left-handed.
2518050 2520375 A southpaw throws your timin' off, see?
2520513 2524463 Other guys, it makes 'em look awkward.<br />Nobody wants to look awkward.
2524601 2528183 - You know where southpaw came from?<br />- (attendant) Nine minutes!
2528314 2532264 A long time ago, a couple of hundred<br />years ago, this guy was fightin'.
2532403 2535854 I think it was around Philadelphia.<br />He was left-handed.
2535990 2538397 His arm was facin' towards New Jersey.
2538536 2541787 And that's south,<br />so they called him Southpaw.
2541915 2544620 You see? Southpaw, South Jersey...
2544752 2548003 ...South Camden, Southpaw...<br />You know what I mean?
2549633 2551708 Things worked out for the best.
2551845 2554466 You never got a chance,<br />being left-handed?
2554598 2558298 Well, that's absolutely true,<br />you know? Watch out, watch out.
2558437 2561391 Agh! Agh! Agh!
2561524 2564857 I just dislocated my finger.<br />Agh! Look at that.
2564987 2567394 No, hey, wait! It ain't your fault. Look.
2567531 2570568 See? Look.<br />It's an old wound. You see that?
2570702 2574534 Look. See? Nothin'.<br />It bends like that. I originally done it...
2574666 2576705 Push the button... Bong! It works.
2576835 2580334 - It ain't your fault. I'll show you...<br />- Seven minutes!
2580465 2583502 I originally done it...<br />I keep pictures of all my fights.
2583636 2586174 I done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. See?
2586472 2589426 He's the size of an airplane.<br />I broke both my hands.
2589559 2595645 I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,<br />don't you think? See how it works there?
2595777 2597852 Come on. Are you havin' a good time?
2597987 2602067 I'll tell ya, you can see I ain't too graceful.<br />I don't move well.
2602202 2605239 But I can really swat, you know?<br />I can really hit hard.
2605372 2610533 But I'm a southpaw and nobody wants to<br />fight a southpaw, you know what I mean?
2613007 2616839 Whooo!<br />You know how I got started in fightin'?
2616971 2619010 - Huh?<br />- No.
2619140 2621215 Am I talkin' too loud?
2621351 2622762 - No.<br />- Three minutes!
2622895 2627439 My father, he's...<br />My old man, he was never too smart.
2627567 2632194 He says to me "You weren't born<br />much of a brain, so start usin' your body."
2632323 2634778 So I've become a fighter.
2634911 2638410 You know what I mean?<br />Why are you laughin'?
2639834 2642669 My mother, she said the opposite thing.
2642796 2645548 What did she say?<br />What did she say, the opposite?
2645674 2649838 "You weren't born much of a body,<br />so you'd better develop your brain."
2649971 2653138 - Did she say that?<br />- Yo! Time!
2653977 2656895 - Can I ask you a question?<br />- Absolutely.
2658190 2661275 - Why do you wanna fight?<br />- Cos I can't sing or dance.
2661402 2663061 Hey, yo!
2663197 2665949 Don't fall! Don't fall!
2666076 2669908 Hey, that was terrific. I'm good at this.<br />You like the way I skate?
2670039 2673040 The last fight I had was<br />with a guy named Spider Rico.
2673168 2675873 He bust my head up.<br />Do you see that scar?
2676005 2678923 I'll tell ya,<br />things get pretty rough in the ring.
2688438 2692103 You know, some people are<br />very shy by nature, you know?
2692234 2694273 I suppose.
2696782 2699569 I say you're very shy by nature,<br />you know?
2699702 2701741 Yeah... I suppose.
2702873 2704663 Hey! Hey!
2704792 2708161 The bum from the dock.<br />Get a job, ya bum!
2709256 2714002 You know, some people think bein' shy<br />is a disease, but it don't bother me none.
2714138 2716379 It don't bother me, either.
2717392 2721306 Why did I bother bringin' it up?<br />Cos I'm dumb, that's why.
2723066 2728024 I think we make a real sharp couple<br />of coconuts. I'm dumb, you're shy.
2730158 2733990 I don't understand why anybody<br />would wanna be a fighter.
2734122 2736244 Hey, you gotta be a moron.
2736374 2739873 You gotta be a moron to wanna be<br />a fighter, you know what I mean?
2740004 2743455 It's a racket where you're almost<br />guaranteed to end up a bum.
2743592 2747126 - I don't think you're a bum.<br />- I'm at least half a bum, you know?
2747264 2750099 I'll tell ya somethin'.
2750226 2753891 The worst thing about fightin'<br />is the mornin' after, you know?
2754023 2758852 I'll tell ya. The mornin' after a fight, you're<br />nothin' but a large wound, you know?
2758988 2761027 Sometimes I got pains all over me.
2761157 2764739 I wanna call a taxi to take me<br />from the bed into the bathroom.
2764870 2769616 Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt, your face<br />is all busted up, your hands is swollen.
2769751 2774081 Look at this face. 64 fights.<br />Look at that nose. See that nose?
2774215 2776540 That nose ain't been broken in 64 fights.
2776677 2781221 I've had guys bustin' on it,<br />chewin' on it, twistin' it, punchin' it.
2781350 2785562 I mean, whack, boom. These guys<br />are hittin' my nose all the time.
2785688 2789306 Never broke. I'm proud of that.<br />Ain't that rare? That's rare.
2789443 2792694 - Why do you do it if it hurts?<br />- Why you think?
2793907 2799032 - Cos you can't sing or dance?<br />- Yeah, somethin' like that.
2799164 2801322 Hey, you wanna come inside?
2803879 2806916 - No, I gotta go.<br />- Hey, come on. I got some animals.
2807049 2810963 I got these very rare animals inside.<br />Come on. Come on in.
2811097 2816092 - No, no. I gotta go.<br />- I gotta go too. I gotta go to the bathroom.
2816228 2818849 - Go on.<br />- No, I gotta go.
2818982 2822019 Hey, look at this face.<br />Is that a face you could trust?
2822153 2827064 Huh? Is it? They oughta stick this face<br />on a stamp. What do you think?
2827201 2829656 Huh? Come on. Come on in.
2835295 2837620 Yo.
2857448 2859487 Flick.
2864290 2867410 - Yo, Adrian, you hungry?<br />- No.
2867544 2872337 I got some things in there. I got soda,<br />some doughnuts or somethin'.
2872467 2874755 A couple of cupcakes, huh?
2874887 2878138 No? I think I got some chocolate in there.
2878266 2880305 No?
2887487 2889942 Hot in here, you know?
2891408 2893863 I could go for some music.
2899127 2900953 Yo, Adrian.
2901087 2903756 These are the exotic animals<br />I told you about.
2903883 2907252 - These are my friends Cuff and Link.<br />- I sold 'em to ya.
2907387 2911301 Sure, I know you sold 'em to me.<br />You were workin' at that pet shop.
2911434 2914933 First day you was there,<br />I bought both these animals.
2915064 2920022 Sure, I remember that. I bought this bowl<br />and I bought the animals themselves...
2920154 2923239 ...the food,<br />the marbles that go on the bottom there.
2923367 2929371 Remember that mountain? I had to get rid<br />of it, cos they kept fallin' over and flippin'.
2932461 2935332 Yo, why don't you come on<br />over here and sit down?
2935465 2937373 Hm?
2937510 2939751 It's a nice couch. I don't know...
2941807 2945757 There's big bugs in there, you know?<br />It's safer over here.
2947648 2949687 You wanna sit down?
2955241 2957529 Are these your parents?
2957661 2959986 Yeah, that's both of 'em there.
2960122 2962743 - Is this you?<br />- Yeah, that's me when I was eight.
2962875 2966208 That's the Italian Stallion<br />when he was a baby.
2968216 2972760 Why don't you come on over and<br />make yourself comfortable? Relax.
2976811 2979432 - Do you have a phone?<br />- No, I ain't got no phone.
2979564 2982897 I had it pulled,<br />cos of people callin' all the time.
2983027 2986645 Who needs the aggravation, right?<br />The interruptions.
2986782 2991112 - Who do you wanna call?<br />- I wanna let my brother know where I am.
2992080 2994571 Why?
2994709 2999667 - I think he might be worried.<br />- Well, I'll call him, if that's the problem.
3002176 3007171 Yo, Paulie! Your sister's with me!<br />I'll call ya's back later! See ya!
3013775 3015933 You don't like the room, do ya?
3016070 3019274 - It's fine.<br />- Well, it's only temporary, you know?
3019575 3021614 It's not that.
3026166 3031327 What's the problem? You don't like me?<br />Or the turtles? What's the problem?
3031631 3034549 - I don't think I belong here.<br />- It's OK.
3037180 3039552 I don't belong here.
3039683 3043895 Well, you know, it's OK,<br />cos you're my guest, you know?
3044023 3046894 I don't... know you well enough.
3047027 3050977 I've never been in<br />a man's apartment alone.
3052242 3055327 Well, I have.<br />They're all the same, you know?
3060252 3062921 I'm not sure I know you well enough.
3064131 3066253 I don't feel comfortable.
3066385 3070299 Yo, Adrian, you know,<br />I ain't so comfortable either.
3071642 3075011 - I should go.<br />- Don't go, please. Don't go.
3075145 3077552 Don't go. Don't go.
3077691 3079730 Don't go.
3082656 3085408 - Do me a favour?<br />- What?
3085534 3087989 Take off these glasses.
3091250 3093705 You have nice eyes, you know?
3095297 3098084 Do me another favour?
3098217 3100672 Would you take off that hat?
3106895 3109350 I always knew you was pretty.
3110358 3113229 - Don't tease me.<br />- I'm not teasin' ya.
3116533 3119285 I ain't teasin' ya.
3119411 3121866 I just... I wanna kiss ya.
3124668 3127835 You don't have to kiss me back<br />if you don't want...
3127964 3130003 ...but I wanna kiss you.
3201810 3203849 I heard you had a fight comin' up.
3203979 3206980 Yeah, I'm gonna fight next month,<br />January 27th.
3207108 3212316 That's good, man. You come on down<br />the gym. We'll see that you get in shape.
3212448 3214440 Hey, Rock, how you doin'?
3214576 3217780 - Mick was lookin' for you up there, man.<br />- For me? You sure?
3217914 3222244 Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was lookin' for you.<br />Get on up there and see him.
3240067 3244445 - You got somethin' for me?<br />- A guy from Miles Jergens was here.
3244573 3248653 - They need sparrin' partners for Creed.<br />- When was he here?
3248787 3253034 - About an hour ago.<br />- Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
3253460 3256247 I said that before, you dumb dago!
3257340 3261753 I've been comin' here for six years<br />and you always stick it to me. How come?
3261887 3264888 - You don't wanna know!<br />- Yeah, I wanna know how come!
3265016 3267138 - You wanna know?<br />- I wanna know!
3267270 3272063 OK, I'm gonna tell ya! Cos you had<br />the talent to become a good fighter!
3272193 3275028 And instead of that,<br />you became a leg-breaker...
3275155 3278322 ...to some cheap, second-rate loan shark!
3278451 3281488 - It's a livin'.<br />- It's a waste of life!
3300270 3302511 Yes? May I help you?
3307405 3309730 Oh! You must be Mr Rocky Balboa.
3309866 3312951 Mr Jergens is expecting you.<br />Just a moment.
3317918 3320789 Mr Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.
3320922 3322914 Fine.
3323049 3325421 - Please go in, Mr Balboa.<br />- Can I have that?
3325553 3328008 - Oh, certainly.<br />- Thanks.
3332521 3334643 Mr Balboa.
3334773 3338391 How are you? George Jergens.<br />Take a chair, please.
3338528 3340567 Thanks.
3341407 3344076 - Mr Balboa...<br />- You can call me Rocky.
3344202 3348781 Rocky. Tell me, Rocky. You got any<br />representation? You have a manager?
3348916 3350955 Uh, no, just me.
3352128 3355828 Rocky, I've got a proposition<br />I'd like to make to you.
3355967 3359336 - About sparrin'?<br />- I beg your pardon?
3359472 3364016 I know you're lookin' for sparrin' partners<br />and I wanna say I'm very available.
3364144 3367477 - I'm sure you are.<br />- Absolutely. It would be an honour.
3367607 3370692 And you know what?<br />I wouldn't take no cheap shots.
3370820 3375815 - I'd really be a good sparrin' partner.<br />- You don't understand me, Rocky.
3375952 3381029 My proposition's this. Would you be<br />interested in fighting Apollo Creed...
3381167 3384038 ...for the world<br />heavyweight championship?
3388551 3391006 - No.<br />- Listen, Rocky...
3392306 3394512 ...Apollo's seen you fight.
3395018 3398103 He likes you. He wants to fight you.
3398230 3402144 Well, it's just that, you see, uh,<br />I fight in clubs, you know?
3402277 3406856 I'm really a ham and egger. This guy is<br />the best. It wouldn't be such a good fight.
3406992 3410942 But thank you very much,<br />you know? I appreciate it.
3411330 3415743 Rocky, do you believe that America<br />is the land of opportunity?
3417088 3418830 Yeah.
3418965 3421040 Apollo Creed does.
3421176 3426005 And he's gonna prove it to the world<br />by giving an unknown a shot at the title.
3426141 3428976 And that unknown is you.
3429103 3431344 He picked you, Rocky.
3432190 3435441 Rocky, it's the chance of a lifetime.
3435570 3437811 You can't pass it by.
3438741 3440982 What do ya say?
3445082 3449032 All right. That's enough pictures.<br />We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.
3449129 3451667 How do you like<br />the city of brotherly love?
3451799 3455250 Well, just bein' in Philadelphia<br />makes me feel patriotic.
3455387 3459087 Beautiful people in a beautiful city<br />wishin' me the best.
3459226 3462725 I love my Philadelphia brothers.<br />I'm proud to be an American.
3462856 3467602 Apollo, why did you agree to fight a man<br />who has virtually no chance of winning?
3467737 3469943 Look, if history proves one thing...
3470073 3473738 American history proves that<br />everybody's got a chance to win.
3473870 3477488 Didn't you guys ever hear of<br />Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?
3477624 3480828 It is a coincidence that<br />you're fighting a white man...
3480962 3483250 ... on the most celebrated day<br />in US history?
3483382 3489006 I don't know. Is it a coincidence that he's<br />fightin' a black man on the same day?
3489139 3491178 Right on! Tell the truth, brother!
3491309 3493800 How do you feel about your challenger?
3493937 3497022 How do I feel about him?<br />Come here, Rock.
3497149 3501147 - My main man. Rocky, ain't you Italian?<br />- Yeah, I'm Italian.
3501280 3506026 - Well now, what does that mean?<br />- If he can't fight, I bet he can cook!
3507663 3511661 - Do me a favour. His lungs, punch out.<br />- Paulie!
3511794 3515210 Rocky,<br />how do you expect to fight Apollo Creed?
3515340 3519468 Well, jeez, Creed's the best.<br />I guess I'll have to do the best I can.
3519596 3522383 Tell me, Rocky. Just between us...
3522516 3525434 ... where did you get<br />the name "ltalian Stallion"?
3525561 3529974 Oh, I invented that about eight years ago<br />when I was eatin' dinner.
3530109 3536231 Rocky, now your payday will be $150,000.<br />Any comment?
3537994 3540319 - You got no comment, Rocky, right?<br />- No.
3540456 3542246 No comment, right.
3542375 3545993 Wait a minute.<br />I just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, OK?
3546129 3550423 Yo, Adrian! It's me, Rocky.<br />Look at this. Can you believe all this?
3550552 3553506 Rocky, you didn't...!
3553640 3556558 - Thank you, Rocky.<br />- Quit pushin', man!
3556685 3557799 Thank you, Rocky.
3557936 3561934 Don't it matter he's makin' you out a fool?<br />I'd break his lips.
3562067 3565234 - He's takin' cheap shots.<br />- It don't bother me none.
3565363 3570405 Yo, Rock. I guess you'd be lookin'<br />for people to help you out.
3570536 3573205 - Help what?<br />- You know...
3573332 3577164 - Keep you livin' a clean life.<br />- I do OK, you know?
3577295 3581625 You need someone to help with<br />the exercise, stand by with a towel...
3581760 3583467 ...run errands.
3583594 3588636 Who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.<br />I think I'm gonna train myself, you know?
3588768 3593679 Without such good people around to help,<br />you don't have such a good chance.
3593816 3596734 Einstein flunked outta school. Twice.
3596862 3599150 - That so?<br />- Yeah.
3599282 3604787 Beethoven was deaf, Helen Keller was<br />blind. I think Rocky's got a good chance.
3610797 3614462 - Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?<br />- You lookin' to do a good deed?
3614593 3617428 Keep outta my freakin' life!
3617805 3619844 - What did I do?<br />- Nothin'.
3619975 3622810 - Did I say something?<br />- You didn't say nothin'.
3622937 3627184 That's right, you didn't say nothin'!<br />Nothin' at all!
3628820 3630859 I gotta go.
3631448 3633903 Where's the freakin' pretzels?
3636914 3640614 Goddamn the pretzels!<br />Hey, we don't have any beer!
3641795 3645294 I thought you were supposed<br />to pick up some beer!
3652851 3656267 How'd you like hearin'<br />your name on TV tonight?
3657357 3660062 I was shocked. Why'd you do that?
3660193 3664060 - Come on, you're puttin' me on, right?<br />- Absolutely.
3664199 3667983 - What time should I expect you?<br />- Oh, about seven.
3668121 3670160 Hey.
3683641 3685680 Hey.
3686686 3690304 You know I said that stuff on TV<br />didn't bother me none?
3690441 3692480 Yeah?
3694197 3696236 It did.
3706128 3709544 Listen, the reason I've<br />brought you here is because...
3709674 3712081 Have you got money<br />for trainin' expenses?
3712220 3716170 - I got a few dollars, you know?<br />- Well, here. Put this in your glove.
3716308 3719807 - What's this?<br />- 500 bucks. Don't worry about it.
3720772 3725019 You ain't never had any luck, but this time<br />Lady Luck may be in your corner.
3725153 3728154 - What do ya think?<br />- Maybe. Maybe...
3728282 3733573 - Hey, thanks for the money, Tony.<br />- It's OK. Don't worry about it. See ya.
3733705 3735164 - Wait a minute.<br />- What?
3735291 3738162 - You're in trainin'. Huh? Come on.<br />- Hey.
3745888 3748094 - Yo, Tony?<br />- What?
3748224 3750299 You gonna show up at the fight?
3750435 3752641 - Ringside.<br />- Hey, hey!
3754316 3756355 I'll see ya.
3790779 3792818 (Rocky) Yeah!
3797705 3801121 Hello, kid. I seen your light.<br />Can I come in?
3801251 3803409 - Yeah, sure.<br />- Yeah. Good!
3803545 3806297 Hey, this is a nice place here.
3806425 3809592 Anyway, what I come to tell you<br />is that, uh...
3810805 3814056 ...that what happened to you is freak luck.
3814185 3817352 - Yeah, freak luck.<br />- Ain't it true? Look at the other guys.
3817481 3821313 They're good fighters.<br />They're colourful, they got good records.
3821443 3823768 They fight their guts out for peanuts.
3823905 3827985 But you... you got a shot at the title.
3828119 3831653 - Freak luck is a strange thing.<br />- Yeah, sure it is. Can I sit down?
3831790 3834197 Yeah, sure.
3834336 3837835 - What the hell are those?<br />- Oh, they're domestic turtles.
3837965 3841583 The one on top is Cuff and<br />the other is Link. The rest are marbles.
3841720 3845171 Yeah? They make good soup, do they?
3845308 3848890 Anyway, look, I'm here to warn ya...
3849022 3853483 ...that you gotta be very careful<br />about this shot that you got at the title.
3853611 3858653 Because, I don't know, like the Bible says,<br />you ain't gonna get a second chance.
3859535 3862904 - Yeah, all right.<br />- You thought of that, huh?
3863039 3866206 Well, what you need is a manager.
3867169 3869291 A manager. Listen to me.
3869423 3873005 I know, because I've been<br />in this racket for 50 years.
3873136 3876387 - 50 years, huh?<br />- 50 years. God, I've seen it all.
3876515 3879267 All of it. You know what I done?
3879394 3881932 - What?<br />- I have done it all.
3882064 3885764 You shoulda seen me when<br />I knocked Giny Russel outta the ring.
3885902 3889947 Outta the goddamn ring, I tell ya.<br />September 14, 1923.
3890074 3894119 And it was the same night that<br />Firpo knocks Dempsey outta the ring.
3894247 3897284 - The same night. Who gets the publicity?<br />- Dempsey.
3897417 3899705 - That's right, but why?<br />- Cos he was champ.
3899837 3902957 No! Because he had a manager.
3903091 3905712 I had nothin', man.
3905845 3909427 I wanna show you somethin'.<br />Look at my face for a minute. Look.
3909557 3914468 I got 21 stitches over this left eye.<br />I got 34 stitches over this eye.
3914606 3918105 You know what?<br />I had my nose busted 17 times.
3918236 3922400 The last time was with<br />that fight with Sailor Mike.
3922532 3925533 I got the clippin' here. A good fight.
3925662 3927570 Read that.
3927706 3929745 Well, it doesn't matter.
3929876 3933080 Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear.
3934340 3937544 Ah, Rocky Marciano!
3938720 3942800 You know, you kinda remind me<br />of the Rock, do you know that?
3942934 3946552 - You really think so?<br />- That's right. You move like him.
3946690 3948729 And you got heart, like he did.
3948858 3952109 Yeah, I got heart,<br />but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?
3955826 3958531 Uh... anyway, you know...
3958663 3961664 ...when I begun in this business, kid...
3962835 3967545 Look, I wanna make a suggestion.<br />Don't drink that piss before a fight.
3967675 3971423 It's no good for ya.<br />You don't mind my sayin'...?
3971554 3976181 Anyway, when I started this racket,<br />pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.
3976310 3982016 For $10, you gotta tear somebody's throat<br />out. But I never had no management.
3982569 3987446 One time, this son of a bitch<br />that I fought, he put a nail right there.
3987576 3989734 - In his thumb?<br />- Yeah, in the glove.
3989870 3992325 And he punched<br />so many holes in my face...
3992457 3997582 ...I had this spit shootin' outta my cheeks.<br />Can you imagine that?
3997713 4001212 When I tell you what I looked like<br />when I was in my prime...
4001343 4004214 I want ya to look at somethin'.<br />Will ya look at that?
4004347 4008511 That's the way I looked<br />before these guys got at me.
4008645 4012179 That's nice.<br />You don't take care of the picture, though.
4012315 4016395 Well, I never had no management.<br />That was the trouble.
4016530 4021109 Now I got all this knowledge.<br />I got it up here and I wanna give it to you.
4021244 4025823 I wanna take care of you. I wanna make<br />sure all this shit that happened to me...
4025958 4029623 ...doesn't happen to you.<br />You know what I mean?
4029755 4033539 - The fight's set.<br />- Listen to me. I wanna be your manager.
4033676 4037376 - You follow that, do you?<br />- The fight's set. I don't need no manager.
4037515 4042094 But you can't buy what I'm gonna give ya.<br />I've got pain and I've got experience.
4042229 4045396 I got pain and I got experience too.
4045525 4049190 - Now listen, kid...<br />- Hey, yo. Hey, Mick.
4049322 4053367 I needed your help about ten years ago.<br />You never helped me none.
4053494 4056698 - You didn't care.<br />- Well, if you wanted help...
4056831 4060876 I say, if you wanted help,<br />why didn't you just ask me, kid?
4061003 4064502 Look, I asked,<br />but you never heard nothin'!
4064633 4066672 Well, I...
4067512 4069551 I, uh...
4070391 4072846 I'm 76 years old.
4077066 4079105 And, uh...
4101473 4103512 Ah, shit.
4114031 4116985 Took you long enough to get here.
4117118 4121995 Ten years to come to my house. What's<br />the matter? You don't like my house?
4122124 4124449 My house stink?
4124585 4126910 That's right. It stinks!
4127047 4129454 I didn't ask no favours from you!
4129592 4131667 Don't throw it around!
4132137 4136217 Talkin' about your prime.<br />What about my prime, Mick?
4136643 4139098 At least you had a prime!
4139229 4144390 I ain't had no prime! I ain't had nothin'!<br />Legs are goin', everything's goin'!
4144528 4149736 Guy offers me a fight. Big deal! Wanna<br />fight the fight? Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.
4149869 4153403 I'm gonna go and fight that big fight.<br />I'm gonna get that!
4153540 4156292 I'm gonna get that!
4156419 4159290 And you wanna be ringside and see it?<br />Do ya?
4159422 4163502 You wanna help me out? Huh? Do you<br />wanna see me get my face kicked in?
4163636 4168513 Legs ain't workin', nothing's workin'!<br />They go "Go on, fight the champ!"
4168642 4170681 Yeah, I'll fight him.
4172940 4175692 Get my face kicked in.
4175819 4180980 You come around here! You wanna move<br />in with me? Come on in! It's a nice house!
4181117 4184202 Real nice! Come on in and move! It stinks!
4185164 4187452 This whole place stinks!
4187918 4191251 You wanna help me out?<br />Well, help me out!
4191380 4194381 Come on! Help me out! I'm standin' here!
4243781 4245654 (alarm rings)
4253419 4259256 (radio) It's 28 degrees. We'll check that<br />forecast in a minute. I feel very... weird.
4259385 4263050 Very... Well,<br />the thing is I got vinyl seats in my car.
4263181 4266218 When I hit the seats this morning,<br />I just went "Whoo!"
4266352 4270397 I figured if I'm up, everybody<br />in the Delaware Valley should be up.
4270525 4274357 Do you agree? At three minutes<br />past four, what else are you gonna do?
4274487 4278187 - (ringing tone)<br />- (woman) Hello?
4278326 4282074 Good morning, Mrs Kramer!<br />This is Don Cabot, WYBG Philadelphia.
4282206 4285124 - How are you this morning?<br />- Huh? What?
4285252 4290626 I think you have a lot of nerve callin' me<br />at this hour in the morning! Goodbye!
4290758 4295088 # WYBG
4297101 4301598 # Philadelphia
4302691 4305526 Ha! We got Mrs Kramer up<br />and it's a good morning.
4305653 4309865 Boy, I need somethin' to struggle with.<br />28° - it's cold out there.
4309992 4315283 We've been getting away with murder<br />for weeks. Our high today could be 30.
4315415 4319115 Tonight we're back down in the 20° range,<br />colder in the suburbs.
4319254 4323121 And tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,<br />we may hit 40 somewhere.
4323260 4327923 But it's awfully chilly. Make sure you<br />have it bundled up before you bring it out.
4467457 4471790 Come on. It stinks... Hey, come on!<br />It stinks in here, you know?
4471924 4473965 Yeah, I know.
4475764 4478518 Hey, do you kill all these things?
4478645 4481102 No, across the street.
4482736 4485525 This place looks like an animal morgue,<br />you know?
4485658 4488745 - It's a little cold in here, ain't it?<br />- Yeah.
4493381 4495838 Who killed all these things?
4495969 4499506 - What, are you crazy?<br />- Pay Gazzo or you end up on a hook.
4499643 4502052 Hey, Gazzo's a good man. You know that.
4502190 4507865 Hey, don't get excited. I know that. That's<br />why I want you to talk to him about me.
4507992 4510485 I can get me out of this stinkin' freezer.
4510622 4516131 Why don't you do yourself a favour?<br />Keep this job, because you eat better.
4516258 4519131 Moo... Does it ever snow in here?
4520683 4524814 Uh, you and my sister.<br />How are you gettin' along together?
4525818 4527859 How you think?
4527989 4530945 Uh, I'm not sure, Rock. What's the story?
4531621 4535669 - About what?<br />- What's the story? What's happening?
4535795 4538882 - You really like her?<br />- Sure I like her.
4541348 4544802 I don't see it. What's the attraction?
4544938 4548392 I don't know. It fills gaps, I guess.
4548528 4552695 - What's "gaps"?<br />- I don't know. She's got gaps, I got gaps.
4552828 4555535 Together we fill gaps. I don't know...
4556877 4559037 You ballin' her?
4559173 4560585 Hey!
4560718 4563805 Hey, you don't talk dirty about your sister.
4565268 4567725 You screwin' my sister?
4569860 4573314 You see? That's why I can't<br />connect you with Gazzo, Paulie.
4573450 4577665 Because you got a big mouth, you know?<br />You just talk too much.
4577792 4582042 - It's gettin' cold in here. I'm goin' home.<br />- Cold in here?! It is cold in here!
4582175 4585511 It stinks in here! And you stink!
4611064 4613224 (cracking)
4613360 4616031 You're breakin' the ribs.
4634859 4639192 If you do that to Apollo Creed,<br />they'll put us in jail for murder.
4640912 4643583 I'll see you tomorrow mornin', OK?
4656024 4658731 - I turned the heat up.<br />- Thanks.
4658863 4663825 You know, your brother's a good man,<br />but he's awful pushy, you know?
4672848 4677644 - You want me to rub you down?<br />- No, I'm just sore, OK? I'll just sit here.
4677774 4680231 - You sure?<br />- Yeah, I'm sure.
4683619 4686622 Hey, come on. No foolin' around, all right?
4686750 4688708 I'm tired.
4688837 4690878 Hey, Adrian, I'm serious now.
4691008 4695056 There's no foolin' around durin' trainin'.<br />I wanna stay strong.
4695182 4698269 - You're not kiddin'.<br />- No, I ain't kiddin'.
4701027 4702937 - You sure?<br />- Yeah, I'm sure.
4703072 4705779 Why don't you just make the meat, OK?
4707664 4709907 OK, I'll make the meat.
4733547 4735588 Yo.
4736344 4738919 - It's OK.<br />- I'm sorry.
4739058 4741099 Hey.
4743149 4745190 Hey, c'mon.
4746113 4748154 C'mon.
4768656 4770816 Underneath. Underneath.
4770952 4773789 Underneath! Underneath! Come on!
4773916 4776491 Rock, hold it, hold it.<br />Hold it, Rock, will ya?
4776629 4780332 You're drivin' me crazy,<br />you're so sloppy. You're off balance.
4780470 4785469 Let's try this. Take this string. Tie it<br />to both ankles. Leave two feet of slack.
4785605 4789392 - I ain't never had good footwork.<br />- Never mind. You're off balance.
4789529 4794658 Marciano... He had the same problem<br />and this string cured it.
4794789 4799205 The idea is that if you can move<br />and hit without breakin' the string...
4799339 4803209 ...you got balance. You become<br />a dangerous person. You follow?
4803347 4805887 - You're lookin' good, Rock.<br />- Thanks.
4806018 4807810 That's it. Underneath!
4807939 4810432 Hey, Rock, how about an autograph?
4810569 4814902 Get outta here! Don't you ever interrupt<br />me while I'm conductin' business.
4815036 4817743 Move your little chicken asses out.
4817874 4821827 Listen, kid. You...<br />You lay off that pet-shop dame.
4821966 4824375 Women weaken legs.
4825681 4830014 - Yeah, but I really like this girl...<br />- Then let her train ya!
4832653 4835740 - OK, no more foolin' around.<br />- OK, now hit it.
4837913 4840786 Women weaken legs, huh?
4844759 4847216 - Yo, Rock!<br />- Yo, Rocky!
4853359 4855733 Yo!
4855863 4858356 - Yo!<br />- Yo, you look great.
4859537 4862030 - Really?<br />- Oh, yeah. Terrific.
4862167 4864541 I mean, you're gonna be a heartbreaker.
4864672 4868673 You'll walk down the street,<br />breakin' hearts. Very sharp.
4868805 4871725 - I got another surprise for you.<br />- What?
4872729 4877311 Hey, Butkus! Hey, Butkus,<br />gimme a kiss! Come here!
4877446 4880900 - To keep you company when you run.<br />- (Rocky howls)
4881036 4883707 (dog barks)
4884835 4887791 Come and meet the family.<br />The owner never come back?
4887924 4890713 - He's yours if you want him.<br />- Boy, do I want him!
4890847 4893720 - What's he eat, this dog?<br />- He eats little turtles.
4893852 4896095 Yo, Butkus!
4919318 4923153 What's that, Butkus, huh?<br />Whose truck is this? C'mon.
4925538 4928209 One call from me, you're a celebrity.
4930172 4933092 - You need exposure.<br />- Don't breathe on me, Paulie.
4933219 4935890 That's the big time...<br />I know about these things.
4936016 4939518 - What do these guys want from me, huh?<br />- To watch you train.
4939648 4942521 Hey, what is the matter with you?<br />This is private.
4942654 4946026 - I'm doin' you a favour.<br />- No, you're embarrassin' me...
4946160 4949199 ...in front of everybody,<br />in front of your sister.
4949333 4953203 You see this cigar? Stick it in your ear.<br />Don't do these things to me.
4953341 4957638 You shoulda called me up or somethin'.<br />Leave a message. Don't do that!
4957766 4960223 My sister really likes you.
4961064 4964815 - I'm gonna kill you one of these days!<br />- Come on, come on.
4964946 4966987 - Pretty...<br />- Baby.
4967117 4971617 Here he is, the next heavyweight<br />champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!
4971751 4975004 Rocky Balboa, we wanna get<br />a brief interview in with you.
4975132 4976675 - What about me?<br />- What about you?
4976802 4979176 - In charge of the meat.<br />- Stand behind it.
4979307 4981550 Listen, just settle down. Just relax.
4981686 4984393 What we're going to do<br />is ask you a few questions...
4984525 4987018 ...about your unique training method.
4987155 4990906 Talk to the folks at home.<br />They wanna know how you got into this.
4991038 4995834 This isn't an everyday thing. Jimmy,<br />you guys ready? Rocky, turn around here.
4995964 5000095 - Just don't take no cheap shots.<br />- No, I won't do that. Just relax.
5000222 5004603 Today we're here with heavyweight<br />challenger Rocky Balboa. The reason...
5004730 5007936 Hey, freak guy's stickin' his face in.
5008070 5009980 Let's try it again, Rocky.
5010742 5013948 Today we're with heavyweight<br />challenger Rocky Balboa.
5014082 5016491 The reason we're in this refrigerated box...
5016628 5019667 ... is that Mr Balboa has<br />an unusual method of training.
5019801 5023469 In a moment, he's going to<br />demonstrate that for viewers at home.
5023600 5027517 But first, Rocky,<br />how did you come to train in an icebox?
5027649 5031068 Uh, well, my friend,<br />the guy over there, he let me in one day.
5031197 5033238 I hit the beef and I kinda liked it.
5033368 5036905 Since I've become a challenger,<br />the owner don't mind neither.
5037042 5041125 Is this a common training method?<br />Do other fighters pound raw meat?
5041258 5046423 - No, I think I invented it.<br />- Would you give us a demonstration?
5046560 5050062 (Apollo) And be sure<br />to fly my barber to Philly.
5052989 5055660 How much is going to<br />West Coast advertising?
5055786 5058113 - $300,000.<br />- Make it 450.
5058249 5060373 Send the mayor's wife 200 roses...
5060503 5063423 ...and make sure we get<br />a picture for the newspapers.
5063551 5066471 Do you want to run<br />15 radio spots in the Midwest?
5066598 5069269 You could spend better<br />in Canadian publicity.
5069395 5074560 Either way, I've got friends in Toronto<br />who could get you good tax breaks.
5074697 5077154 George, I like your friends.
5084048 5089295 Hey, champ, you oughta come and look<br />at this boy you're gonna fight on TV.
5089433 5092721 - Looks like he means business.<br />- Yeah, I mean business too.
5092857 5098235 - Hey, Shirley, we got any more coffee?<br />- Certainly, Mr Creed. I'll get you some.

5166998 5171248 - (Adrian) He called the reporters?<br />- (Rocky) It threw my trainin' schedule off.
5171381 5173838 Don't be mad at him. He's tryin' to help.
5173969 5178968 Adrian, I ain't mad. It's just that when<br />reporters are around, I get out of joint.
5179104 5182107 They take cheap shots. Paulie knows that.
5182235 5185404 Paulie keeps askin' me<br />for a job all the time...
5185533 5188370 ...but he don't know nothin' about fightin'.
5188497 5191619 Are you gonna say anything to him?
5191753 5195670 What's to say?<br />I just don't know what he wants from me.
5197556 5200179 I don't want nothin' from you.
5200437 5203440 I don't want nothin' from you.
5203567 5207402 This ain't no charity case.<br />Get outta my house!
5207533 5210240 It's not just your house.
5210372 5214373 He's no friend no more.<br />Get outta my house, I just said.
5214505 5218672 - Don't talk to him like that.<br />- Both of ya, get outta my house!
5218805 5222508 Yo... it's cold outside, Paulie.
5232456 5234497 I don't want ya messin' her.
5234627 5237084 I don't raise ya to go with this scumball!
5237215 5239672 Yeah?! C'mon!<br />You wanna hit on me? C'mon!
5239803 5244100 I'll break both your arms,<br />so they don't work for ya!
5245982 5250030 I'm not good enough to meet with Gazzo?<br />That's what I think of Gazzo!
5250156 5254453 Now you're a big-shot fighter on your way<br />up, you don't even throw me a crumb!
5254581 5259247 When I go and get you meat every<br />mornin'! I even give you my sister, too!
5259382 5262801 - Only a pig would say that!<br />- I'm a pig?
5262931 5265424 A pig gets you the best?
5265561 5269146 I'm a loser!<br />I don't get married because of you!
5269485 5271645 You can't live by yourself!
5271781 5276411 I put you two together, and you...<br />don't you ever forget it! You owe me!
5279420 5281497 - You owe me!<br />- What do I owe you?
5281633 5284042 You're supposed to be good to me.
5284179 5287716 What do I owe you, Paulie?<br />What do I owe ya?
5287853 5292566 I treat you good. I cook for you, I clean<br />for you, I pick up your dirty clothes!
5292696 5296827 I take care of you, Paulie!<br />I don't owe you nothin'!
5296954 5302119 And you made me feel like<br />a loser! I'm not a loser!
5302256 5304630 - You're busted!<br />- What?!
5304760 5308595 You're not a virgin!<br />You let a man take down your pants!
5308726 5311682 She's busted! (whimpers)

5346214 5348885 You want a roommate?
5352852 5355606 Absolutely.
5355899 5361064 OK, now when you walk into the ring<br />with the No.1 heavyweight of the world...
5361201 5363610 ...you'll be ready, won't ya? Why?
5363748 5367998 Because I've waited<br />for 50 years to make ya ready.
5368131 5370671 You'll be able to spit nails, kid.
5370803 5375184 Like the guy says, you're gonna eat<br />lightning and you're gonna crap thunder!
5375311 5378267 You're gonna become<br />a very dangerous person.
5378401 5381440 - Yo, Mickey!<br />- Hey! Oh, Rock.
5381573 5384695 I want ya to meet our cut man here,<br />Al Salvani.
5384829 5387702 - Take a look at his eye, kid.<br />- How you doin', Al?
5387835 5390791 - Not bad. I've seen worse.<br />- You ain't so bad yourself.
5390924 5393713 - Cover up. Things'll be OK.<br />- You cover up.
5393847 5398679 - Go and take a shower, will ya?<br />- OK, Mick. I'll see ya's tomorrow.
5398814 5402731 - Hey, you covered that Whitmore fight.<br />- That's why he won.
5402864 5405737 Listen, we got a winner here.<br />We got a chance.
5405870 5408957 He goes to the body<br />like nobody you've ever seen.
5409084 5412171 You just stand by for him.<br />We're gonna win.
5418769 5421440 Hey, Rocky. It's OK I talk to ya?
5422192 5424649 OK you talk to me? Sure.
5425699 5428274 I figured an angle<br />to make money off your name.
5428413 5431167 My name? How's that?
5431293 5434166 Advertising. I know about that stuff.
5435885 5438972 What do you know about advertising?<br />Huh?
5441646 5446608 Hey, you can make money off my name,<br />make it, OK? I'm gonna take a shower.
5447491 5449984 - Hey, wanna help me off with these?<br />- Sure.

5718465 5721967 Rocky. What brings you here tonight?
5723224 5725895 Mr Jergens, the poster's wrong.
5726021 5730983 - What do you mean?<br />- I'm wearin' white pants with a red stripe.
5734496 5739921 It doesn't really matter, does it? I'm sure<br />you're gonna give us a great show.
5740841 5744260 Try to get some rest, kid. Good night.
5836899 5839059 I can't do it.
5841449 5843573 What?
5843704 5845745 I can't beat him.
5846793 5848834 Apollo?
5848964 5851338 Yeah.
5851468 5854555 I been out there, walking around, thinkin'.
5856311 5860442 I mean, who am I kiddin'?<br />I ain't even in the guy's league.
5864911 5866952 What are we gonna do?
5878270 5880311 I don't know.
5886118 5888575 You worked so hard.
5889750 5893252 Yeah, it don't matter,<br />cos I was nobody before.
5895344 5897587 Don't say that.
5897723 5901225 Come on, Adrian. It's true. I was nobody.
5903484 5906155 But that don't matter either, you know?
5907200 5909443 Cos I was thinkin'...
5910331 5913418 It really don't matter if I lose this fight.
5915131 5919262 It really don't matter if this guy<br />opens my head either.
5920350 5923437 Cos all I wanna do is go the distance.
5927739 5931490 Nobody's ever<br />gone the distance with Creed.
5931621 5934078 And if I can go that distance...
5935170 5938672 ...and that bell rings and I'm still standin'...
5943644 5947347 ...l'm gonna know for<br />the first time in my life, see...
5948988 5953119 ...that I weren't just another<br />bum from the neighbourhood.
6019539 6021782 Time, kid. Let's go.
6024506 6026963 I'll wait for you here.
6028765 6032302 Well, how about I wait here and you fight,<br />you know?
6032438 6035940 You're lookin' very great today.<br />You know that? Mm?
6037573 6040660 I gotta go now,<br />but don't you leave town, huh?
6042040 6045079 Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it.
6045213 6047171 Good luck.
6047300 6050802 Say, Adrian, you don't think<br />this robe is too baggy, you know?
6050932 6053971 - Good luck.<br />- Don't leave town.
6056192 6059813 I'd like you to meet the man<br />working the fight with me, Stu Nahan.
6059949 6064164 Thank you, Bill Baldwin. The electricity<br />is all over the place tonight...
6066086 6070003 What the hell is that? I trained you<br />to be a fighter, not a billboard.
6070135 6073008 - I'm doin' it for a friend.<br />- What do you get out of it?
6073141 6076844 - Paulie gets three grand, I get the robe.<br />- Shrewd.
6076981 6079818 On tonight's fight,<br />their difference in style...
6079945 6083862 ...a recent magazine said it could be<br />the caveman against the cavalier.
6083995 6088625 The buzzing in the background could be<br />the challenger getting into the ring.
6088754 6094797 - Rocky! Look at me! Ya cost me $200.<br />- Oh. I gotta go. I gotta work.
6094932 6097222 - How's the robe?<br />- A little baggy.
6097354 6100357 (Bill) A 50-1 underdog,<br />a Cinderella story...
6100485 6104533 ...and he's captured people's<br />imaginations all over the world.
6108667 6110957 We love you, Rocky!
6111088 6113795 - Yo, champ!<br />- Hey, thanks for showin' up.
6113927 6118474 (Stu) His record: 44 victories -<br />38 by knockout. And he's lost 20 fights.
6118602 6121142 (Bill) Which makes me wonder,<br />can he stand it?
6121274 6125774 The stamina and the skill to last<br />the three rounds? Las Vegas odds say no.
6125908 6129362 Rocky Balboa climbing into the ring now.
6129498 6134544 The Italian Stallion. Some meat sign<br />on the back of his robe there. See that?
6134675 6136918 "Shamrock Meat Company."
6137054 6141304 (Stu) There's a lot of noise.<br />You could go deaf with that noise!
6141438 6143728 Am I seeing right back there?
6143859 6147028 Is that the world heavyweight champion,<br />Apollo Creed?
6147157 6151288 (Bill) He's riding in a boat. Is he<br />supposed to be George Washington?
6151415 6154169 Obviously so.<br />He's got the hat on. Look at that.
6154295 6158212 (Stu) Well, it's been confirmed.<br />The world champion Apollo Creed...
6158345 6161633 ... is doing an imitation<br />of George Washington.
6162770 6164514 He's throwing money.
6164648 6168863 Remember when we talked about<br />George Washington throwing a dollar?
6168990 6173786 Of course, throwing a dollar<br />in those days went a lot farther.
6173916 6177003 The white wig came off,<br />the hat came off...
6177965 6180540 I want all of you!
6180679 6186022 And the crowd is loving every minute of it.<br />Here is the world heavyweight champion.
6186148 6190648 (Bill) For you around the world,<br />he was dressed as George Washington.
6190782 6193869 I want all of you! Come on, Stallion!
6197294 6200131 - (Stu) Uncle Sam himself...<br />- I want all of you!
6200258 6205387 - All of you! I want all of you!<br />- He looks like a big flag.
6205518 6208011 I want you! You!
6208816 6210810 - Is he talkin' to me?<br />- He is.
6210945 6213153 - Is he talkin' to me?<br />- Let him talk.
6213283 6215776 I want the Stallion! Come on!
6215913 6218786 (Bill) He says "I want the Stallion!"
6219670 6223837 In foreign countries during World War I<br />there was a picture of Uncle Sam...
6223970 6225880 ...with his finger pointed -
6226015 6230479 ...a recruiting poster for our fellows<br />in the army and the navy. "I want you!"
6230607 6232648 (Stu) That's what he's doing a take on.
6232778 6235698 - That's it. "Creed" he's yelling.<br />- "Creed in three."
6235826 6238200 What do you think that outfit cost?
6238330 6240573 (fanfare)
6243674 6245917 (bell)
6248517 6251473 Ladies and gentlemen...
6251606 6255393 ...good evening. A very happy new year.
6255530 6257571 Welcome to Philadelphia.
6257701 6260788 (Stu) Everybody who's anybody<br />is here tonight.
6262502 6269257 Time does not permit me to introduce<br />the many luminaries of politics...
6269390 6273723 ...show business and the sporting world<br />who are with us tonight.
6274357 6279438 But I would like to present<br />one of the immortals of pugilism...
6279576 6283113 ...a champion in and out of the ring.
6283249 6285920 Philadelphia's own Smokin' Joe...
6286046 6289168 ...the beloved Mr Joe Frazier!
6289303 6291974 (cheering, whistling and applause)
6299405 6303108 Hi, how are you doing?<br />Don't hurt him, OK?
6303246 6306499 (Stu) What a credit he's been<br />in his career as a fighter.
6306627 6308835 He's coming over to talk with the champ.
6308965 6312004 - Hey, Joe!<br />- You been dumpin' me long time.
6312138 6315011 You next, Joe! You next, Joe!
6316145 6318554 They must be friends.
6326206 6328034 Joe Frazier!
6328168 6332834 Fight fans around the world, get settled<br />down, because it won't be long now.
6332969 6334345 (bell)
6334472 6338342 And now... for the main event!
6341945 6344652 On my left, the challenger.
6345702 6350083 In white trunks, weighing 190lb...
6350210 6353083 ...Philadelphia's favourite son...
6353216 6357929 ...the Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa!
6358059 6360730 (cheering and some booing)
6364696 6369409 And on my right,<br />wearing red, white and blue...
6369539 6372708 ...weighing 210lb...
6373045 6376251 ...undefeated in 46 fights...
6376677 6379300 ...the Master of Disaster...
6379433 6383018 ...the undisputed<br />heavyweight champion of the world...
6383315 6387185 ...Apollo Creed!<br />- (cheering)
6387323 6389816 I want you! I want you!
6392541 6394831 You, chump! I want you!
6394962 6397336 You've both fought in Philadelphia before.
6397467 6401384 You know the rules. No low blows.<br />Watch your heads. No buttin'.
6401516 6406681 - Shake hands now and come out fightin'.<br />- Put your hands up, chump. Come on!
6406818 6411282 (Bill) A little body play goin' on there.<br />Rocky taking it carefully, though.
6411410 6415197 He's just going over and being calm,<br />it looks like from here.
6415334 6417874 There goes the big hat.
6420302 6424552 (Stu) I've never seen a fighter<br />that concerned about his hair!
6432576 6435745 And there's the bell for round one.
6435874 6440255 The fighters come out into the centre<br />of the ring, looking at each other.
6440382 6445344 Creed the champion zipping those<br />left-handed jabs, right in the head.
6447562 6450850 The champ stinging<br />the slower challenger jabs at will.
6450986 6454987 In fact, it looks like Rocky is<br />blocking the blows with his face.
6455119 6459535 The champion doesn't look the best<br />he's ever been, but he's moving smoothly.
6459669 6463622 Well, the champion is smiling now.<br />He's toying with his man.
6463760 6468473 Tryin' to give the fans their money's<br />worth. He's makin' a show of it.
6468603 6472105 And a very badly outclassed<br />challenger right now.
6474363 6476523 (Bill) Creed trying to<br />make this man make...
6476660 6479580 See? Make him miss like that.
6479707 6482461 (Stu) Oh, the champ<br />is just taunting him now.
6485510 6487967 Creed dancing around.
6488933 6491426 I don't believe it! The champ is down!
6491563 6493604 (Bill) Yes, he is!
6498910 6502079 Creed is down! What a surprise this is!
6503419 6507716 (Stu) This is the first time the champion<br />has ever been knocked down.
6509096 6511589 Six! Seven! Eight!
6511726 6514895 He appears to be all right.<br />Glancin' around...
6515275 6519691 (Mickey) Come on, Rock! Go to the ribs!<br />Let's go to work right now, Rock!
6521244 6525577 (Bill) Rocky comes back out. He's like<br />a bull in a china closet. He really wants it.
6525711 6528334 Apollo, left to the head.
6528467 6532931 (Stu) Now the champion's comin' back.<br />He's comin' off the floor now.
6533810 6539568 (Bill) Another left, another right.<br />Combinations into the face. That's Apollo!
6542660 6546079 Now the champ is taunting Rocky<br />to come and get some more.
6546209 6548203 Left. Another.
6548338 6550462 Another left!
6551469 6553926 And Rocky's coming back now!
6554725 6557598 Left! Right! Rocky's got him on the rope!
6558399 6560642 OK, let's break it.
6565120 6568823 There's no way they expected<br />this kind of hitting power.
6568960 6573341 But the ability of the champion,<br />Apollo, is apparent.
6575473 6579973 (Stu) Apollo unloading,<br />Rocky really tight against the ropes.
6580107 6582148 (bell)
6586911 6591541 They're leading him back over to his<br />corner. Rocky can hardly find his way.
6591670 6594757 - I told ya! I told ya!<br />- Your nose is broke.
6594885 6597175 - How does it look?<br />- It's an improvement.
6597306 6600594 I want you to quit chuckin' and jivin'.<br />Stick and move.
6600729 6602308 Go for the ribs.
6602441 6606109 - Don't let that bastard breathe.<br />- The guy's great.
6606240 6609861 He doesn't know it's a damn show.<br />He thinks it's a damn fight.
6609997 6612870 - Finish this bum and let's go home.<br />- Right.
6613462 6615705 Stay to the body! To his right!
6615841 6619343 (Stu) Here we go. Round two.<br />Creed predicted he would win in three.
6619473 6623094 Creed got knocked down in the first.<br />He came back at the end.
6623230 6625307 (Bill) Oh, he's working now.
6625443 6627936 Oh, that sharp left! Again, a hard right.
6628073 6630613 He's working Rocky into the corner again.
