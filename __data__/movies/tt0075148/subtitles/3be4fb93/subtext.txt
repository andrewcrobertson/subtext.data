1377108 1378810 He's doing<br />better than you are.
1378877 1380549 Hey, Paulie.<br />What, do you lock the door?
1381513 1382761 Yo, Paulie.
1383348 1385751 I'd like to kill the freaking moron<br />who broke the mirror.
1385817 1386906 Hey, yo, Paulie.
1388153 1390355 Every day,<br />every night, I pass by.
1390422 1392558 Your sister's<br />giving me the shoulder.
1392624 1394035 -Forget her.<br />-What do you mean?
1394102 1396328 -You can do better than her.<br />-I don't forget nothing.
1396355 1398530 Every night I pass by,<br />I tell a joke.
1398597 1401266 Every morning I pass by,<br />I tell a joke.
1401332 1403014 She just looks at me,<br />you know what I mean?
1403041 1404056 Looks?
1404083 1406014 Yeah, like I'm<br />a plate of left overs.
1406371 1408373 I need a Cadillac<br />to connect with your sister?
1408440 1410206 Something wrong with my face?
1411342 1412948 She's a freaking loser.
1413344 1414980 Sometimes<br />she gets me so crazy,
1415046 1416615 I could split her head<br />with a razor.
1416682 1417926 Oh, don't get mental.
1417973 1419618 You caught me in a bad mood.
1419685 1421086 You're always in a bad mood.
1421152 1422521 Adrian ain't sharp.
1422588 1423800 Adrian is a loser.
1424366 1426848 She's pushing 30<br />freaking years old.
1427025 1429360 If she don't watch out,<br />she's gonna die alone.
1429427 1430729 I'm 30 myself.
1430796 1432063 And you'll die alone.
1432130 1433932 I don't see no crowd<br />around you neither.
1434199 1436468 I'd like to kill the freaking moron<br />who broke the mirror.
1436535 1437950 Come on.<br />Let's get out of this stink.
1440001 1441270 I wanna talk to you anyway.
1441457 1442608 About what?
1442974 1444242 You still work for Gazzo?
1444309 1445443 Yeah, sure.
1445511 1448179 Why don't you<br />talk to him about me?
1448246 1451140 I just don't think<br />Gazzo's hiring right now.
1451637 1453852 You know? Come on.
1458023 1460225 -The girl's dried up.<br />-Who?
1460291 1463122 My sister. If she don't start living,<br />her body's gonna dry up.
1463929 1466331 Tomorrow's Thanksgiving,<br />you know that?
1466397 1467866 Come over and talk to her.
1467933 1469315 Sure. Beer.

1471703 1473973 Absolutely. You got it.
1474410 1477442 I gotta go. If I'm ten minutes late,<br />she calls the hospital.

1503401 1504636 The first major event<br />in the country's...
1504703 1506849 -Clown?<br />-That's right, clown.
1507706 1510408 And in keeping with great events<br />throughout the country's history,
1510475 1512343 Apollo Creed will<br />duplicate the cracking
1512410 1514479 of the Liberty Bell<br />by cracking Green.
1514546 1516782 You're calling<br />Apollo Creed a clown?
1516968 1518570 What else? Look at him.
1519317 1521519 Stay in school<br />and use your brain.
1521587 1524590 Be a doctor, be a lawyer,<br />carry a leather briefcase.
1524656 1526391 Forget about<br />sports as a profession.
1526457 1528159 Sports make you<br />grunt and smell.
1528226 1530028 Be a thinker,<br />not a stinker.
1530095 1531863 Thanks a lot, champ.
1531930 1534165 You crazy? This man is<br />champion of the world.
1534232 1536445 He took his best shot<br />and become champ.
1537603 1539145 What shot did you ever take?
1539371 1542874 Hey, Rocky, you're not<br />happy with your life, that's nice.
1542941 1544509 But me,<br />I got a business going.

1574906 1576041 No wine, man.
1576107 1577398 Come on. Just a little.
1577435 1578894 Buy us some<br />Thunderbird.

1580779 1582881 Marie, does your brother know<br />you're hanging out so late?
1582948 1585216 Get lost, creep.<br />Screw you, yo-yo!
1585283 1587282 These guys teach you<br />to talk like that?
1587308 1590155 -Stuff it!<br />-Don't you never say that to me.
1590989 1593524 You stink up the neighborhood!
1594976 1596082 You know, you can...
1596728 1598319 When I was your age,
1598346 1600652 only one girl in the whole neighborhood<br />talked like that.
1601399 1602641 That was it. Just one.
1603318 1604366 What are you doing?
1604803 1606571 It'll make your teeth yellow.<br />Don't do that.
1606638 1607973 I like yellow teeth!
1608039 1609607 It'll make your breath<br />like garbage.
1609675 1611834 Maybe I like garbage.<br />Nobody likes garbage.
1612711 1615213 Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth<br />wasn't bad looking,
1615280 1617359 but none of the guys<br />ever took her serious.
1617716 1619398 They never took her out<br />for any serious date.
1619785 1621352 -Why?<br />-'Cause that's the way guys are.
1621419 1622458 They laugh<br />when you talk dirty.
1622504 1623512 They think you're cute.
1623579 1626224 After a while, you get a reputation.<br />You get no respect.
1626291 1628660 You understand?<br />You get no respect.
1628727 1631429 I gotta use<br />a bad word, whore.
1631496 1633431 You understand? Whore.
1633498 1637263 See? You use dirty words, and maybe you<br />end up becoming a whore.
1637869 1639470 Come on, Rocky. I'm 12.
1639537 1640790 That don't matter.
1642007 1643371 You don't really<br />have to be one.
1643408 1645110 Just act like one<br />and that's it.
1645176 1647979 Boom! Bing!<br />You get a bad rep.
1648046 1649247 You understand?
1649314 1651723 20 years from now,<br />people are gonna say,
1652550 1654920 "Do you remember Marie?"<br />"No. Who was she?"
1654986 1657409 "She was the little whore who hung down<br />at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."
1657506 1659958 "Oh, yeah.<br />Now I remember her."
1660025 1661827 You see,<br />they don't remember you.
1661893 1663181 They remember the rep.
1663268 1664710 (DOG BARKING)<br />You understand?
1666164 1667456 You got a boyfriend?
1668133 1669291 No, you ain't<br />got a boyfriend.
1669868 1671102 You know why?
1671169 1672638 Why don't you think<br />you have a boyfriend?
1672674 1674613 'Cause you're hanging out with them<br />coconuts on the corner.

1682380 1683715 You hang out<br />with smart people,
1683782 1684883 you get smart friends.
1684950 1686284 You hang out<br />with yo-yo people,
1686351 1687485 you get yo-yo friends.
1687552 1689721 You see,<br />it's simple mathematics.
1690822 1692257 -I hope you ain't...<br />-I won't.
1692323 1693459 What was I gonna say?
1693495 1696627 You hope I don't keep acting like a whore<br />or I'll turn into one, right?
1696694 1697796 Yeah, something like that.
1697863 1698997 Good night, Rocky.

1712010 1714813 Yeah, who are you to<br />give advice, creep-o?
1714880 1716314 Who are you?
1735166 1736474 Are the doctor's<br />reports confirmed?
1736521 1737679 JERGENS: Definitely.
1738636 1740505 Says here Mac Lee Green<br />has suffered
1740571 1743869 "a severely cracked third metacarpal<br />in his left hand."
1744345 1745487 Damn!
1746144 1748539 We can cancel<br />the fight indefinitely
1748586 1750115 if you're set on<br />fighting Green.
1750181 1751770 Hey, it ain't just Green.
1752517 1754603 What about all the time<br />Apollo has invested?
1754920 1756587 We can find a solution.
1756654 1757726 Solution nothing.
1757803 1760558 Find me another ranked contender<br />in a flash, Jergens.
1760625 1762627 MAN: Don't play games<br />with my client.
1762693 1765263 Apollo's already done a million dollars'<br />worth of publicity,
1765330 1768266 has made contractual obligations with<br />20 different organizations.
1768333 1770068 He's not going<br />to be embarrassed!
1770135 1771997 I contacted<br />Ernie Roman's manager.
1772603 1774572 Ernie's fighting in France<br />that same week.
1774639 1776558 Then get me Buddy Shaw.<br />He's ranked fifth.
1776875 1779365 Went to California<br />and gained 50 pounds.
1780211 1782180 JERGENS: I called every<br />worthwhile contender.
1782247 1786217 They all say five weeks isn't enough time<br />to get into shape.
1786284 1788413 Shape nothing, man.<br />They're afraid.
1788820 1790822 They know everybody<br />is gonna see this fight.
1790889 1792514 None of them's got<br />a prayer of whipping me.
1792891 1794443 They're making excuses<br />so they don't have to be
1794470 1795528 the chump who gets whipped.
1796995 1799615 All I can say is<br />I'm a good promoter.
1800131 1803521 I've promoted fights<br />in every goddamn country in the world
1803548 1805570 and I've broken<br />my ass over this one.
1805636 1807533 I don't know<br />what else to do!
1810842 1812143 (SIGHING)
1813478 1814612 I do.
1816982 1820006 Without a ranked contender, what this<br />fight needs is a novelty.
1821352 1822971 This is the land of<br />opportunity, right?
1823889 1826084 So, Apollo Creed,<br />on January 1st,
1826391 1829508 gives a local underdog fighter<br />an opportunity.
1830195 1833722 A snow-white underdog, and I'm gonna put<br />his face on this poster with me.
1834599 1835611 And I'll tell you why.
1836567 1837646 Because I'm sentimental.
1838904 1841569 A lot of other people<br />in this country are just as sentimental
1841596 1844542 and there's nothing they'd like better<br />than to see Apollo Creed
1844609 1845977 give a local Philadelphia boy
1846044 1847812 a shot at the greatest<br />title in the world
1847879 1849148 on this country's<br />biggest birthday.
1850215 1851830 Now that's the way I see it
1852817 1854450 and that's the way<br />it's gonna be.
1854986 1856547 Apollo, I like it.
1857265 1858697 It's very American.
1859624 1862627 No, Jergens. It's very smart.

1892112 1893434 and a grand from Cappoli,<br />right?
1893451 1897395 No, no. Two yards from Cappoli<br />and a grand from Snyder.
1897462 1899230 -Two yards.<br />-Write it down, okay?

1916847 1919750 Tell you what to do.<br />Take her to the zoo.
1919817 1921352 I hear retards<br />like the zoo.
1921419 1923488 This bum gotta say that?<br />BUDDY: Who you calling a bum?

2021219 2022380 He's a southpaw.
2022787 2024555 I don't want you messing around<br />with southpaws.
2024622 2026221 They do everything backwards.<br />Southpaw nothing.

2039837 2041506 I used to be<br />deadly at stickball.
2041572 2043108 Your sister knows<br />I'm coming?
2043174 2044642 PAULIE: She's very excited.
2044709 2045843 Look at these swollen hands.
2045910 2047085 Yeah.
2047222 2049824 The joints from carrying meat<br />in and out of the freezer.
2050481 2051565 Plays hell on the joints.
2051641 2053228 Maybe you ought<br />to see a doctor.
2053684 2055720 I don't need a doctor.<br />I need a different job.
2055786 2058443 Different job. What kind of turkey?<br />Big? Small?
2058458 2061359 Talk to Gazzo.<br />Tell him I'm a good man.
2061726 2062971 Nothing bothers me.
2063328 2064795 I'd make a great collector.
2064862 2066934 Busting bones<br />don't bother me.
2066981 2068563 Don't bother you.<br />Big turkey, right?
2069400 2072036 Gazzo's gotta give me...<br />Forget Gazzo. It's a bad job.
2072382 2073467 You got a match?
2074105 2076073 Go to him for me.<br />As a favor.
2076141 2078909 Yeah, yeah.<br />Last time I had a turkey
2078976 2080601 was when they had<br />a two-dollar special

2136367 2138343 ADRIAN: Why didn't you tell me<br />you were bringing him here?
2138769 2140101 I'm not ready for this.
2140238 2141857 PAULIE: Would it make<br />a difference if you were?
2142443 2144175 He's taking you out.
2144242 2145410 No, I can't.
2146331 2148747 I want you out of<br />the kitchen right now.
2149817 2151052 I won't.

2161592 2163894 Go out and live.<br />Enjoy life!

2237615 2240838 Forget nothing. Go ahead.<br />Tell her something funny.
2240905 2242240 Ain't nothing to talk about.
2242277 2244074 She's in a bad mood.<br />I'm in a bad mood.
2244141 2245543 You can do funny things.
2245610 2246927 You wanna go out<br />with my sister?
2247144 2248679 -Yeah.<br />-Well...
2252883 2254279 I don't know what to say.
2254585 2255786 Funny.
2267398 2269177 Yo, Adrian.<br />It's me, Rocky.
2269804 2271102 Rocky, you know?
2272236 2273471 Listen, uh,
2275773 2279377 I don't know what to say, 'cause I ain't<br />never talked to no door before.
2281379 2284882 What do I say to a door?<br />We better forget this.
2284949 2286183 You're doing fine.
2286250 2288109 I ain't doing fine.<br />I look like an idiot.
2288586 2290321 Keep doing what you're doing.<br />Funny.
2290688 2291970 I know all about<br />these things.
2292777 2294102 I feel like a jerk.
2300731 2302407 Yo, Adrian,<br />it's Rocky again.
2303233 2307375 Listen, uh, I know you ain't<br />too happy at this moment.
2308373 2309820 But could you do me a favor?
2309837 2311870 I ain't got nobody<br />to spend Thanksgiving with.
2313277 2316581 So, uh, how about<br />maybe you and I
2316647 2318483 go out together,<br />get something to eat.
2318549 2320678 Maybe laugh a little bit.<br />Who knows, you know?
2321185 2322603 Would you like to, uh...
2324755 2327592 Would you like to, maybe,<br />you and me go out together?
2327658 2329117 What do you think?<br />Would you like to?
2335045 2336542 We're gonna have a good time.
2337868 2339704 We'll have a real good time.
2344575 2345750 Thanks for the bird.
2350014 2352220 I'm gonna turn the TV off.<br />I got a headache.
2365295 2366597 What's your sister<br />like to do?
2366664 2367742 Ice-skate.
2367819 2369767 Adrian, come on.<br />You're letting the heat out.
2369834 2371266 Who pays the bills<br />around here?
2377742 2380078 Listen, uh, I don't want no<br />turkey anyway, you know?
2382480 2383954 But it was Thanksgiving.
2385282 2386417 What?
2386484 2387552 It was Thanksgiving.
2387618 2389941 Yeah, to you. But to me it's Thursday,<br />right?
2415212 2416581 It looks kind of quiet.
2416647 2417962 I think it's closed.
2418008 2420041 No, I think we're just early<br />or something like that.
2422487 2423488 We're closed.
2423554 2424622 What?
2424689 2426023 I said we're closed.
2426090 2427692 Yeah. Hey, listen.
2427758 2429494 I'm gonna smooth this guy out.<br />Wait here.
2430070 2431095 I'll be right back.
2431161 2433063 -We could go someplace else.<br />-No, it's okay.
2433130 2435099 Are you closed to<br />the general public,
2435165 2436414 or are you just<br />closed to everybody?
2437201 2439867 It's after 6:00.<br />It's Thanksgiving.
2439924 2441259 That's why<br />there's nobody here.
2441706 2443741 Besides, you ain't<br />supposed to be in here.
2443808 2445510 So do me a favor<br />and not stay here.
2446126 2447248 Could you do me a favor?
2447845 2449547 Come on.<br />We're not operating.
2450214 2453050 Look. This girl here<br />ain't feeling well.
2453117 2455103 Doctors say she should<br />go out and exercise.
2455560 2456838 Ice-skating's<br />probably the best thing.
2457955 2459223 So what do you want from me?
2459289 2460848 Well, hey,<br />I want you to do me a favor.
2460905 2462280 You can see<br />she ain't feeling too good.
2462977 2465440 If you can let her on the ice for a<br />few minutes, I'd appreciate it.
2465996 2467328 Ten minutes, ten bucks.
2467865 2469637 -Ten bucks?<br />-How about eight bucks?
2470134 2471796 Come on.<br />It's Thanksgiving.
2472503 2474054 All right.<br />Nine bucks, you got a deal.
2474471 2476421 You have the ice to yourself.<br />Ten bucks.
2479343 2480778 Give her the blades.
2481912 2483180 Aren't you skating?
2483247 2485249 No, I ain't skated<br />since I was 15.
2485315 2487918 That's when I<br />started fighting.
2487985 2489955 Skating's kind of<br />bad for the ankles, you know?
2491522 2493305 You're a pretty good skater,<br />aren't you?
2495092 2497595 Like I was saying before<br />on the way over here,
2497662 2499921 fighting used to be<br />tops with me, but no more.
2500898 2503533 All I wanted to do out of fighting was<br />prove I was no bum,
2503570 2505393 that I had the stuff<br />to make a good pro.
2505970 2507271 You never got the chance?
2507337 2509176 I ain't crying about it.
2509193 2511341 I still fight.<br />I do it like a hobby.
2511408 2513398 The trouble is<br />I'm a southpaw.
2513474 2514779 What's a southpaw?
2514845 2516614 A southpaw means<br />you're left-handed.
2516681 2518469 A southpaw throws<br />your timing off.
2518546 2521321 It throws other guys' timing off,<br />makes them look awkward.
2521358 2522777 Nobody wants<br />to look awkward.
2523153 2524755 You know where<br />"southpaw" came from?
2524822 2525976 MAN: Nine minutes!
2526223 2528262 A long time ago,<br />there was this guy,
2528288 2529476 maybe a couple<br />hundred years ago,
2529524 2530935 he was fighting in the, uh...
2531001 2533030 I think it was<br />around Philadelphia.
2533097 2534775 His arm...<br />He was left-handed.
2534812 2536411 His arm was facing<br />towards New Jersey.
2537267 2541005 And that's south. So naturally they<br />called him "south paw." You see?
2541071 2544335 Southpaw, South Jersey,<br />South Camden.
2544842 2546722 Southpaw.<br />You know what I mean?
2548478 2550314 Things probably worked out for the best,<br />don't you think?
2550380 2553050 Never got a chance because<br />you're left-handed, huh?
2553117 2555219 That's absolutely true,<br />you know?
2555285 2556553 Watch out.
2558555 2561859 (GROANING)<br />I just dislocated my finger.
2561926 2563631 -Ah! Look at that.<br />-Oh!
2564228 2566030 Wait.<br />It ain't your fault. Look.
2566096 2568598 See? I had it...<br />It's-- It's an old wound.
2568625 2570801 You see that? Look. See?
2570868 2572236 Nothing. It bends like that.
2572302 2573824 I originally done it...<br />Push the button.
2574171 2575372 Bong. It works.
2575439 2576874 It ain't your fault. Look.
2576941 2578308 MAN: Seven minutes!
2579076 2581030 I originally done it...
2581037 2582189 I carry pictures<br />of all my fights.
2582226 2584139 I originally done it<br />in the Baby Crenshaw fight.
2584915 2586516 ROCKY: Baby's about the size<br />of an airplane.
2586583 2588118 I broke both hands<br />on his face.
2588185 2590228 I lost that fight, but that's a nice<br />picture, don't you think?
2591555 2592823 Real nice.
2594391 2595714 Come on.<br />You having a good time?
2597461 2598926 You can see<br />I ain't too graceful.
2599463 2602036 I don't move well,<br />but I can really swat.
2602482 2603868 I can really hit hard.
2603934 2606327 But I'm a southpaw, and nobody wants to<br />fight no southpaw.
2611508 2612810 Whoo!
2612877 2614392 You know how I got<br />started in fighting?
2615479 2616546 No.
2617547 2618824 Am I talking too loud?
2619750 2621318 MAN: Three minutes!
2621385 2623320 My father, he's a...
2623387 2625956 My old man,<br />he was never too smart.
2626023 2628125 He says to me, "You weren't born<br />with much of a brain,
2628192 2630728 "so, uh, you better<br />start using your body."
2630795 2632190 (LAUGHS)<br />So I become a fighter.
2633397 2634532 You know what I mean?
2635199 2636967 Why you laughing?
2638368 2641305 My mother,<br />she said the opposite thing.
2641371 2643058 What did she say<br />the opposite?
2644274 2646836 She said, "You weren't born<br />with much of a body,
2646873 2648378 "so you better<br />develop your brain."
2648445 2649714 Did she say that?
2649780 2651215 Yo, time!
2652516 2654051 Can I ask you a question?
2654118 2655352 Absolutely.
2656653 2657965 Why do you wanna fight?
2658322 2659760 'Cause I can't sing or dance.
2660057 2661348 Hey, yo.
2661726 2663460 ROCKY: Don't fall!
2664695 2666491 That was terrific.<br />I'm pretty good at this.
2667197 2668335 You like the way I skate?
2668483 2671311 Last fight I had, I had with this guy<br />named Spider Rico.
2671668 2673674 He busted my head up there.<br />You see that scar?
2674471 2677474 I'll tell you, things get pretty<br />rough in the ring.
2686917 2689687 You know, some people<br />are very shy by nature.
2690955 2692189 I suppose.
2692990 2695059 (CLEARS THROAT)
2695125 2697535 I say you're very shy<br />by nature, you know?
2699229 2700597 I suppose.
2701365 2702560 Hey, hey.
2703267 2704535 The bum from the dark.
2705102 2706497 Get a job, you bum!
2707604 2710507 Some people think that<br />being shy is a disease,
2710574 2712392 but it don't bother me none.
2712609 2714041 Don't bother me either.
2715880 2717495 So why'd I bother<br />bringing it up?
2718082 2719364 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.
2721518 2723553 I think we make<br />a sharp couple of coconuts.
2723620 2725470 I'm dumb and you're shy.<br />What do you think?
2728725 2731766 I don't understand why anybody would<br />wanna be a fighter.
2732662 2737912 You gotta be a moron to wanna be a<br />fighter, you know what I mean?
2738468 2740982 It's a racket where you're almost<br />guaranteed to end up a bum.
2742039 2743283 I don't think you're a bum.
2743400 2745222 I'm at least half a bum.
2745709 2747068 But I'll tell you something.
2748745 2750705 Worst thing about fighting<br />is the morning after.
2751381 2752783 -You know?<br />-Morning after.
2752850 2754751 Yeah,<br />the morning after a fight,
2754819 2757047 you're like a large wound,<br />you know what I mean?
2757454 2759563 Sometimes I--I--I got<br />pains all over me.
2759589 2761291 I feel like<br />calling a taxi to take me
2761358 2762453 from the bed<br />into the bathroom.
2763360 2765262 Your hair hurts,<br />your eyes hurt.
2765329 2768232 Your face is busted up.<br />Your hands are swollen.
2768298 2769867 Look at this face.<br />Sixty-four fights.
2769934 2771121 Look at that nose.
2771298 2772406 You see that nose?
2772803 2774271 That nose ain't<br />never been broken.
2774338 2776640 I had guys busting on it.
2776706 2779516 I had guys chewing on it,<br />twisting and punching it.
2779844 2781445 I mean, whack, boom.
2781511 2783308 These guys are hitting my nose<br />all the time.
2784114 2786083 Never broke it.<br />I'm very proud of that.
2786110 2787141 That's rare.
2787818 2789419 Why do you do it<br />if it hurts?
2789486 2790715 Why you think?
2792289 2795159 'Cause you can't<br />sing and dance?
2795225 2796637 Yeah, something like that.
2797794 2799169 Hey, you wanna come inside?

2818889 2820411 Is that a face<br />you could trust or what?
2821718 2824559 Is it? They ought to stick this face on a<br />stamp. What do you think?
2826980 2828058 Come on in.

2888318 2889753 (SNIFFLING)
2889819 2891521 I could go for some music.
2897481 2898689 Yo, Adrian.
2899396 2902066 These are the exotic animals<br />I was telling you about.
2902132 2903984 (SOFT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)<br />These are my friends, Cuff and Link.
2904501 2905702 I sold them to you.
2905769 2907304 I know you sold them to me.
2907371 2909433 Remember you were working<br />at that pet shop?
2909940 2912880 First day you was there, and I came in<br />and bought both these animals?
2913477 2914515 I remember that.
2914612 2918415 I bought this bowl and the, uh,<br />animals themselves.
2918482 2921085 Some food, the marbles<br />that go on the bottom there.
2921151 2923120 Remember that mountain?
2923187 2924454 I had to get rid<br />of that mountain.
2924501 2925946 They kept fall<br />over and flipping.
2930827 2932827 Why don't you come over here<br />and sit down?
2935865 2937767 It's a nice couch.<br />I don't know.
2940404 2941708 There's big bugs in there.
2942006 2943507 It's safer over here.
2946076 2947237 You wanna sit down?
2953717 2956086 Uh, these your parents?
2956153 2958132 Yeah,<br />that's both of them there.
2958488 2959623 Is this you?
2959689 2961501 Yeah. I was eight years old.
2961538 2963734 That's the Italian Stallion<br />when he was a baby.
2966496 2967691 Come on over.
2967727 2969376 Make yourself comfortable.<br />Relax.
2975172 2976473 Do you have a phone?
2976540 2978592 No, I had it pulled.
2978638 2980344 'Cause people<br />calling all the time,
2980410 2983147 and, uh, who needs<br />the aggravation, right?
2983213 2984499 Interruptions.
2985115 2986260 Who'd you wanna call?
2986916 2988826 I wanna let my brother<br />know where I am.
2990454 2991555 Why?
2993223 2994468 I think he might be worried.
2994924 2997037 I'll call your brother,<br />if that's the problem.
3000497 3002766 Yo, Paulie!<br />Your sister's with me!
3002832 3005469 I'll call you back later!<br />See you!
3012109 3014028 You don't like the room,<br />do you?
3014444 3015779 It's fine.
3015845 3017281 It's only temporary.
3017912 3018949 It's not that.
3024521 3027131 What's the problem?<br />You don't like me?
3027557 3029549 You don't like the turtles?<br />What's the problem?
3030116 3031328 I don't think I belong here.
3031395 3032729 It's okay.
3035499 3036681 I don't belong here.
3037967 3040837 Well, you know, it's okay,<br />'cause you're my guest.
3042372 3045375 I don't know you<br />well enough.
3045442 3048778 I've never been<br />in a man's apartment alone.
3050614 3053450 Well, they're all the same,<br />you know?
3058622 3060290 I'm not sure<br />I know you well enough.
3062559 3063748 I don't feel comfortable.
3064794 3067664 Yo, Adrian, I ain't<br />so comfortable either.
3069766 3070961 I should go.
3071668 3074003 Don't go, please.<br />Don't go.
3076039 3077341 Don't go.

3089519 3091438 You have nice eyes,<br />you know?
3093723 3094839 Do me another favor?
3096426 3098042 Why don't you<br />take off that hat?
3105202 3106744 I always knew<br />you was pretty.
3108732 3109789 Don't tease me.
3109796 3111025 I'm not teasing you.
3114878 3116213 I ain't teasing you.
3117747 3120384 I just wanna...<br />I wanna kiss you.
3123019 3125205 You don't have to kiss me back<br />if you don't wanna,
3126122 3127557 but I wanna kiss you.

3210840 3212576 Hey, Rock. How you doing?
3212642 3214844 Mick was looking<br />for you up there, man.
3214911 3216079 For me? You're sure?
3216145 3218282 Yeah, yeah.<br />He's looking for you.

3238167 3240003 You got something for me?
3240069 3242906 Yeah, there was some guy from<br />Miles Jergens looking for you.
3242972 3246476 They need sparring partners for Apollo<br />Creed. There's the card.
3246543 3248244 -When was he here?<br />-About an hour ago.
3248312 3250345 They're probably looking for<br />sparring partners for Creed.
3251681 3254150 I said that before,<br />you dumb Dago!
3255685 3257563 I been coming here<br />for six years,
3257600 3259012 and six years you been<br />sticking it to me.
3259058 3260223 How come?
3260290 3261491 You don't wanna know!
3261558 3263327 Yeah, I wanna know how come.
3263393 3265429 -You wanna know?<br />-I wanna know now!
3265495 3267174 Okay, I'm gonna tell you!
3267631 3271701 You had the talent to become a good<br />fighter, and instead of that,
3271768 3275905 you became a leg breaker for some cheap,<br />second-rate loan shark!
3276840 3278007 It's a living.
3278074 3279909 It's a waste of life!
3298495 3300296 Yes. May I help you?
3305569 3308104 Oh, you must be<br />Mr. Rocky Balboa.
3308171 3309606 Mr. Jergens's expecting you.
3309673 3310974 Just a moment.
3316179 3318265 Mr. Rocky Balboa<br />to see you, sir.
3319148 3320314 Fine.
3321280 3322615 Please go in, Mr. Balboa.
3322642 3323660 Can I have that?
3323687 3324821 Oh, certainly.
3324888 3326055 Thanks.
3330827 3332228 Mr. Balboa.
3332792 3334764 How are you?<br />George Jergens.
3334831 3336066 Take a chair, please.
3336533 3337767 Thanks.
3339603 3340958 Mr. Balboa.
3341505 3342572 Call me Rocky.
3342639 3345785 Rocky, you got<br />any representation?
3345802 3347143 You have a manager?
3347210 3348645 No, just me.
3350279 3354451 Rocky, I've got a proposition<br />I'd like to make to you.
3354518 3355846 About sparring?
3356553 3357681 Beg your pardon?
3358527 3362392 I know you're looking for sparring<br />partners, and I'm very available.
3362459 3364193 -I'm sure you are.<br />-Absolutely.
3364260 3366029 Sparring with the champ<br />would be an honor,
3366095 3367664 -and you know what, Mr. Jergens?<br />-What?
3367711 3368865 I wouldn't take<br />no cheap shots.
3368943 3370861 I'd really be<br />a good sparring partner.
3371468 3372950 You don't understand me,<br />Rocky.
3374270 3375563 My proposition's this.
3376940 3379342 Would you be interested<br />in fighting Apollo Creed
3379409 3381231 for the world<br />heavyweight championship?
3386716 3387917 No.
3387984 3389519 Listen, Rocky.
3390520 3391902 Apollo's seen you fight.
3392896 3394101 He likes you.
3394958 3396056 He wants to fight you.
3396793 3398245 Well, it's just that,<br />you see, uh,
3398662 3401831 I fight in clubs, you know, and I'm<br />really a ham-and-egger.
3401898 3403227 This guy, he's the best,
3403833 3407107 and it wouldn't be such a good fight,<br />but thank you very much.
3408104 3409173 I appreciate it.
3409589 3413843 Rocky, do you believe that America is<br />the land of opportunity?
3415311 3416312 Yeah.
3417346 3418878 Apollo Creed does,
3419215 3421250 and he's gonna prove it<br />to the whole world
3421317 3423478 by giving an unknown<br />a shot at the title.
3424554 3426556 And that unknown is you.
3427390 3428638 He picked you, Rocky.
3430986 3432596 It's the chance<br />of a lifetime.
3433730 3435665 You can't pass it by.
3436833 3437834 What do you say?

3445609 3447477 REPORTER 1: We wanna ask Apollo<br />a few questions.
3447544 3450079 Apollo, how do you like<br />the City of Brotherly Love?
3450146 3453323 APOLLO: Well, just being in Philadelphia<br />makes me feel patriotic.
3453650 3455318 Beautiful people<br />in a beautiful city
3455384 3457274 coming up to me on the street,<br />wishing me the best.
3457721 3459122 I love<br />my Philadelphia brothers,
3459188 3460524 and I'm proud<br />to be an American.
3460590 3461801 REPORTER 2: Apollo? Champ?
3462158 3464093 Why did you agree<br />to fight a man
3464160 3466029 who has virtually<br />no chance of winning?
3466095 3468097 APOLLO:<br />If history proves one thing,
3468464 3471645 American history proves<br />that everybody's got a chance to win.
3472301 3474968 Didn't you guys ever hear of<br />Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?
3475505 3476973 (LAUGHING)<br />Apollo?
3477040 3479538 Uh, it is a coincidence that<br />you're fighting a white man
3479555 3481711 on the most celebrated day<br />in the country's history?
3481778 3482792 I don't know.
3482929 3485114 Is it a coincidence that<br />he's fighting a black man
3485151 3487416 on the most celebrated day<br />in the country's history?
3487483 3489379 -MAN 1: Right on, Apollo!<br />-MAN 2: Tell the truth, brother!

3495458 3496653 My main man.
3496860 3498194 Rocky, ain't you Italian?
3498261 3499563 Yeah, I'm Italian.
3499629 3500934 Now what does that mean?
3501430 3504200 That means, if he can't fight,<br />I'll bet he can cook.
3504267 3505935 (ALL LAUGHING)
3506002 3508572 Do me a favor.<br />His lungs, punch out.
3508638 3510073 Paulie.

3513910 3515755 Oh, jeez, you know,<br />Creed's the best.
3516082 3517754 I guess I'll have<br />to do the best I can.
3517851 3520200 Uh, tell me, Rocky,<br />just between us,
3520717 3523217 where did you get<br />the name "Italian Stallion"?
3523853 3528291 Oh, uh, I invented that about eight years<br />ago when I was eating dinner.
3528357 3533229 Rocky, now your payday<br />will be $150,000.
3533296 3534698 Any comment?
3536933 3538367 You got no comment,<br />Rocky, right?
3538434 3539536 No.
3539803 3541370 -Thank you, Rocky.<br />-Oh, wait a minute.
3541437 3543433 I just wanna say hi<br />to my girlfriend, okay?
3544440 3546576 Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky.
3547677 3548912 You believe all this?
3548978 3550446 Microphones<br />and all that stuff.
3550513 3551648 You didn't.
3551675 3552692 Thank you, Rocky.
3552729 3555184 Who you pushing, man?<br />Smack you in the mouth!
3555251 3556270 Thank you, Rocky.
3556306 3558454 Don't it matter<br />he making you out a fool?
3558521 3559719 I'd break his lips.
3560356 3561738 He's taking cheap shots.
3561835 3563247 Don't bother me none.
3563993 3568765 Yo, Rocky, I guess you'll be looking<br />for people to help you out.
3568832 3570133 Help what?
3570199 3571434 You know,
3571500 3573036 keep you living<br />the clean life.
3573502 3574882 I do okay, you know.
3575839 3577487 You need someone<br />to help with the exercise
3577514 3581745 and someone standing by with a towel<br />or running errands?
3581811 3584580 Hey, yo, Paulie, who cared<br />about me yesterday? Nobody.
3584648 3587250 So I--I just think I'm gonna train<br />myself, you know?
3587316 3589485 Without such good people around<br />to help you,
3589552 3590948 you don't have<br />such a good chance.

3724653 3725842 Maybe.
3726289 3728224 Thanks for the money, Tony.
3728291 3730557 It's okay. Don't worry about it.<br />I'll see you.
3731795 3733462 -Wait a minute.<br />-What?
3733529 3735431 You're in training. Come on.
3743807 3745435 -Yo, Tony.<br />-What?
3746342 3747717 You gonna show up<br />at the fight?
3748644 3749736 Ringside.
3750013 3751414 (LAUGHING)
3752515 3753783 I'll see you.
3789118 3790119 ROCKY: Yeah.
3795724 3799068 Hello, kid. I seen your light.<br />Can I come in?
3799085 3800189 Yeah, sure.
3800216 3801597 Yeah. Good.
3801664 3803593 Hey, it's a nice place here.
3804600 3807403 Anyway, what I come<br />to tell you is that,
3808771 3812131 that what happened<br />to you is freak luck.
3812198 3813239 Yeah, freak luck.
3813296 3815244 Ain't it true?<br />Look at the other guys.
3815501 3816955 They're good fighters, right?
3816982 3819115 They're colorful.<br />They got good records.
3819742 3821937 They fight<br />their guts out for peanuts.
3822065 3825855 But you, you got<br />a shot at the title!
3826302 3828391 Freak luck is<br />a strange thing, you know?
3828457 3829825 Sure is. Can I sit down?
3829893 3831094 Yeah, sure.
3832528 3833930 What the hell are those?
3833997 3835838 Uh, domestic turtles.
3835914 3838301 The one on the top is Cuff<br />and the other guy's Link.
3838367 3839602 The rest are marbles.
3840038 3841938 Yeah? They make good soup.
3842005 3843106 (LAUGHS)
3843172 3844173 Anyway.
3844640 3846910 Look, I'm here to warn you.
3846976 3851514 You gotta be very careful about this shot<br />that you got at the title.
3851940 3854383 Because, like the Bible says,
3854730 3856619 you ain't gonna get<br />a second chance.
3857420 3858821 Yeah. All right.
3858888 3860823 You thought of that, huh?
3861070 3864327 Well, what you need<br />is a manager.
3865261 3867363 A manager. Listen to me.
3867430 3871167 I know, because I been<br />in this racket for 50 years.
3871234 3874537 -50 years, huh?<br />-50 years. I've seen it all.
3874603 3877941 -All of it. You know what I done?<br />-What?
3878007 3880009 I have done it all.
3880076 3883879 You should've seen me when I knocked<br />Ginny Russell out of the ring.
3883947 3885881 Out of the goddamn ring,<br />I tell you.
3885949 3888154 September 14, 1923,
3888211 3892421 and it was the same night that Firpo<br />knocks Dempsey out of the ring.
3892488 3894890 So who gets the publicity?<br />Figure that out.
3894958 3896759 Dempsey.<br />That's right. But why?
3896825 3897961 'Cause he was champ.
3898027 3900896 No! Because he had a manager.
3900964 3902498 I had nothing.
3903866 3905034 I wanna show you something.
3905101 3906369 I want you to<br />look at my face.
3906435 3907510 Look at this.
3907937 3909772 I got 21 stitches<br />over this left eye.
3909838 3912838 I got 34 stitches<br />over this eye.
3912885 3915755 You know I had<br />my nose busted 17 times.
3916312 3920483 The last time was in that fight<br />with Sailor Mike.
3920549 3923166 I got that clipping here.<br />It was a good fight.
3923552 3924708 Wanna read that?
3925554 3927690 Well, it doesn't matter.
3927756 3931260 Anyway, he put this<br />vegetation on my ear.
3932395 3933696 (EXCLAIMS)
3933762 3935649 "Rocky Marciano."
3936765 3940669 You kind of remind me of the Rock,<br />you know that?
3941146 3942975 -You really think so?<br />-That's right.
3943211 3946679 You move like him, and you got<br />heart like he did.
3946875 3950079 Yeah, I got heart, but I ain't got no<br />locker, do I, Mick?
3953782 3955518 Uh, anyway.
3955584 3958687 You know, when I begun<br />in this business, kid...
3960956 3962958 I wanna make a suggestion.
3963026 3965180 Don't drink that<br />piss before a fight.
3965698 3967043 It's no good for you.
3967830 3969632 If you don't mind my saying.
3969698 3971934 Anyway, you know,<br />when I started in this racket,
3972001 3974237 pugs like us,<br />we was treated like dogs.
3974303 3976739 For $10, you got to tear<br />somebody's throat out.
3976805 3978874 But I never had<br />no management.
3980443 3983596 One time, this--this<br />son of a bitch that I fought,
3983632 3985481 he put a nail right there.
3985548 3987883 In his thumb.<br />In the thumb of the glove.
3987950 3990519 He punched so many<br />holes in my face,
3990586 3993229 I had spit<br />shooting out of my cheeks.
3993656 3994828 Can you imagine that?
3995864 3999095 Anyway, when I tell you what I looked like<br />when I was in my prime.
3999162 4000689 I want you to<br />look at something.
4000996 4003632 Look at that.<br />That's the way I looked
4004567 4006152 before these guys got at me.
4006769 4009959 That's nice. You didn't take very good<br />care of the picture, though.
4010606 4013842 Well, I never<br />had no management.
4013909 4016145 That's the trouble, but now I got<br />all this knowledge.
4016212 4018981 I got it up here.<br />Now I wanna give it to you.
4019048 4020476 I wanna give you<br />this knowledge.
4020513 4021545 I wanna take care of you.
4021581 4025054 I wanna make sure that what happened to<br />me doesn't happen to you.
4025631 4026702 You know what I mean?
4026989 4028824 Mick, the fight's set.
4029261 4031207 Listen to me.<br />I wanna be your manager.
4031804 4032995 You follow that?
4033062 4035258 Fight's set.<br />I don't need no manager.
4035664 4037766 But you can't buy<br />what I'm gonna give you.
4037833 4040203 I got pain<br />and I got experience.
4040269 4042615 I got pain<br />and I got experience too.
4043506 4044944 Listen, kid.
4045141 4046413 Hey, Mick.
4047310 4049378 I needed your help<br />about 10 years ago, right?
4049445 4052448 Ten years ago. You never helped me none.<br />You didn't care.
4052515 4054087 If you wanted help...
4054983 4059021 I say, if you wanted help,<br />why didn't you just ask me, kid?
4059088 4061320 ROCKY: I asked,<br />but you never heard nothing!
4062611 4063770 Well, I...
4065694 4068171 I know I...
4068697 4070233 I'm 76 years old.
4070699 4073035 (TOILET FLUSHING)
4075104 4076305 And...
4112346 4113920 Took you long enough<br />to get here.
4114977 4117180 Took 10 years<br />to come to my house.
4117246 4119248 You don't like my house?
4120216 4121340 My house stink?
4122685 4124160 That's right, it stinks!
4124787 4127122 ROCKY: I didn't ask<br />no favors from you!
4130193 4131701 Talk about your prime.
4132528 4134220 What about my prime, Mick?
4134697 4136143 At least you had a prime!
4137400 4139292 I ain't had no prime.<br />I ain't had nothing.
4139668 4142560 Legs are going, everything is going.<br />Nobody's giving me nothing.
4142738 4144940 Guy comes up, offers me a fight.<br />Big deal.
4144947 4145988 Wanna fight the fight?
4146024 4147393 Yeah, I'll fight<br />the big fight.
4147710 4151514 I'm gonna go fight that big fight<br />and I'm gonna get that!
4151580 4152981 I'm gonna get that!
4154550 4156425 And you wanna be<br />ringside and see?
4156752 4158821 Do you?<br />You wanna help me out?
4158887 4161657 Do you wanna see me<br />get my face kicked in?
4161724 4163726 Legs ain't working,<br />nothing's working.
4163792 4165482 Think I'll go<br />and fight the champ.
4166599 4167693 Yeah, I'll fight him.
4170933 4172246 Get my face kicked in.
4173702 4176272 And you come around here.<br />You wanna move in with me?
4176339 4178144 Come on in.<br />It's a nice house!
4179141 4181710 Real nice!<br />Come on in! It stinks!
4183212 4184462 This whole place stinks.
4185748 4187200 You wanna help me out?
4188016 4190245 Well, help me out!<br />Come on. Help me out.
4190292 4191460 I'm standing here!
4241537 4243339 (RINGING)
4251380 4253148 RADIO ANNOUNCER:<br />It's only about 28 degrees.
4253215 4254517 We'll check that forecast.
4254583 4258317 I feel very mischievous,<br />very weird, very...
4258624 4261123 I got vinyl seats in my car.
4261189 4264293 When I hit those seats this morning,<br />I just went, "Whoo!"
4264360 4265828 I figure if I'm up,
4265894 4268631 everybody in the Delaware Valley<br />should be up.
4268697 4269762 You agree with me?
4269889 4273302 At three minutes past 4:00 in the<br />morning, what else you gonna do?
4273369 4274837 (PHONE RINGING)
4275291 4276369 WOMAN: Hello?
4276395 4277656 Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.
4277693 4280275 This is Don Cabot,<br />WYBG Philadelphia?
4280343 4281444 How are you this morning?
4281470 4282492 What?
4283679 4286549 You have a lot of nerve<br />calling me at this hour of the morning!
4286615 4287916 Good-bye!
4288817 4293622 * WYBG *
4295190 4301063 * Philadelphia *
4301129 4303766 Me and Mrs. Kramer are up,<br />and it's a good morning.
4303832 4306502 I tell you, I need someone<br />to snuggle with. 28 degrees.
4306569 4308637 It's cold out there.<br />We deserve it.
4308704 4310923 We've been getting away with murder<br />the last couple of weeks.
4310989 4313342 Our high today could be...
4313409 4316278 Tonight we're back down<br />in the 20-degree range.
4316345 4317573 A little colder<br />in the suburbs.
4317650 4321149 Tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,<br />we may hit 40.
4321216 4323185 But it's 28.<br />It's awfully chilly.
4323251 4325988 Make sure you have it bundled up<br />before you bring it out.
4409538 4411740 (PANTING)
4462658 4464292 (MACHINE HUMMING)
4468130 4469397 Come on.
4470365 4472935 It stinks in here, you know?
4473001 4474837 Yeah. I know.
4476639 4478674 Did you kill<br />all these things?
4479328 4481343 No, across the street.
4483378 4485532 (LAUGHING)<br />It's like an animal morgue.
4486649 4488483 It's a little cold<br />in here, ain't it?
4488551 4489685 Yeah.
4494356 4496759 Who killed all these things?
4496825 4498493 Are you crazy, Paulie?
4498561 4500829 If you don't pay Gazzo,<br />you end up on a hook.
4500896 4503098 Gazzo's a good man.<br />You know that.
4503165 4504967 Don't get excited.<br />I know that.
4505033 4507202 That's why I wanted you<br />to talk to him about me
4507269 4508591 and the collecting job.
4509037 4511354 I can get me out of<br />this stinking freezer.
4511640 4513408 Why don't you do<br />yourself a favor?
4513475 4515410 Keep this job.<br />You eat better.
4517045 4518107 Moo.
4518714 4520156 Does it ever snow in here?
4521584 4525788 Uh, you and my sister,<br />how you getting along together?
4526689 4528147 How do you think?
4528704 4531526 Uh, I'm not sure, Rock.<br />What's the story?
4532377 4533426 About what?
4534162 4535764 What's happening?
4536665 4537896 You really like her?
4538323 4539368 Sure, I like her.
4542170 4543968 I don't see it.<br />What's the attraction?
4545774 4548677 I don't know.<br />Fills gaps, I guess.
4549411 4550529 What's "gaps"?
4551246 4552861 I don't know.<br />She's got gaps.
4552908 4555083 I got gaps.<br />Together we fill gaps.
4557720 4559075 You balling her?
4559522 4560556 Hey.
4561523 4563502 You don't talk dirty<br />about your sister.
4566094 4567556 Are you screwing my sister?
4570426 4571447 You see?
4571644 4573609 That's why I can't<br />connect you with Gazzo.
4573646 4575734 Because you got a big mouth.
4575831 4577572 You just talk too much.
4578607 4580442 It's cold in here.<br />I'm going home.
4580508 4582948 Cold in here?<br />It is cold in here!
4583245 4584871 It stinks in here,<br />and you stink!
4598493 4599995 (GRUNTING)
4614242 4616058 You're breaking the ribs.
4635664 4637332 If you do that<br />to Apollo Creed,
4637359 4638681 they'll put us<br />in jail for murder.
4641503 4643606 I'll see you<br />tomorrow morning, okay?
4656785 4658557 -ADRIAN: I turned the heat up.<br />-ROCKY: Thanks.
4659454 4663391 Your brother's a good man,<br />but he's awful pushy, you know?
4673635 4674703 You want me to rub you down?
4674720 4676739 No, I'm just sore, okay?
4676805 4678413 I'm gonna just sit here.
4678540 4680198 -You sure?<br />-Yeah, I'm sure.
4684379 4686299 Hey, come on.<br />No fooling around, all right?
4687382 4688407 I'm tired.
4689684 4691109 Adrian, I'm serious now.
4691686 4693448 There's no fooling around<br />during training.
4693465 4694803 I wanna stay strong.
4695690 4696792 You're not kidding.
4696819 4697976 No, I ain't kidding.
4701797 4703355 -You sure?<br />-Yeah, I'm sure.
4703511 4705311 Why don't you just<br />make the meat, okay?
4708303 4709688 Okay, I'll make the meat.
4728857 4730658 (DISHES CLATTERING)
4736832 4737833 It's okay.
4737900 4739067 I'm sorry.
4739568 4740596 Hey.
4753548 4754716 (SIGHING)
4771466 4772935 TRAINER:<br />Underneath! Underneath!
4773001 4774402 Knock him out! Come on!
4774469 4776911 Hold it. Hold it, Rock!
4776978 4780809 You're driving me crazy. You're so sloppy<br />because you're off balance.
4780876 4782677 Let's try this.<br />Take this string.
4782744 4784346 Tie it to both ankles.
4784412 4786068 Leave about<br />two feet of slack.
4786094 4787515 I never had good footwork.
4787582 4789885 Never mind footwork.<br />Now you're all balanced.
4789932 4792434 Marciano had the same problem
4792821 4794947 and this string cured it.
4795523 4798526 If you can move<br />and hit without
4798593 4800118 breaking the string,<br />you got balance!
4800495 4802797 You become<br />a dangerous person.
4802865 4805047 -You follow me?<br />-TRAINER: Looking good, Rock.
4805063 4806188 Thanks.
4806224 4808036 Let's go. That's it.<br />Underneath it.
4808103 4809137 WOMAN: Hey, Rock.
4809204 4811173 -What?<br />-How about an autograph?
4811239 4812707 Get out of here!
4812774 4815543 Don't interrupt me while<br />I'm conducting business.
4815610 4817400 Move your little<br />chicken asses out.
4817946 4819534 Hey, listen, kid.
4819882 4821947 You lay off<br />that pet shop dame.
4822584 4824953 Women weaken legs.
4826221 4828343 Yeah, but I really<br />like this girl, you know?
4828450 4829922 Then let her train you!
4833128 4835097 Okay, no more fooling around.
4835163 4836731 Okay. Now hit it.
4838500 4840768 Women weaken legs, huh?
4845307 4846875 Yo, Rock.<br />Yo, Rocky.
4857552 4859087 You look great.
4860222 4861910 -Really?<br />-Oh, yeah.
4862257 4864109 Terrific. I mean,<br />you could be a heartbreak.
4865196 4867519 You'll walk down the street breaking<br />hearts the way you're looking.
4867565 4868777 Very sharp.
4869364 4871256 I got another<br />surprise for you.
4871363 4872518 What?

4969631 4971433 champion of the world,<br />Rocky Balboa!
4971499 4973435 Hello there.<br />Rocky Balboa.
4973501 4975437 We wanna get a brief<br />interview with you.
4975503 4977292 -What about me?<br />-What about you?
4977309 4978326 I'm in charge of the meat.
4978393 4979774 Fine. Stand behind it.
4979841 4981876 Settle yourself down. Relax.
4981943 4984622 What we're going to do<br />is ask you a few questions.
4984879 4987449 Just a few questions about<br />your unique training method.
4987515 4988771 Talk to the folks at home.
4989007 4991453 They really wanna know<br />how you got into this.
4991519 4992854 This isn't<br />an everyday thing.
4992920 4994222 Jimmy, you guys ready?
4994289 4996391 Let's roll it.<br />Rocky, turn around here.
4996458 4997986 Just don't take<br />no cheap shots, you know?
4998393 4999952 No, I won't do that.<br />Just relax.
5000428 5003898 Today we're here with<br />heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.
5003965 5005567 The reason<br />we're standing in this...
5005633 5007049 CAMERAMAN: The meat guy's<br />sticking his face in.
5008403 5009889 Let's try it again, Rocky.
5011206 5014276 Today we're here with<br />heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.
5014342 5016911 The reason we're standing<br />in this refrigerated box
5016978 5020182 is that Mr. Balboa has an unusual<br />method of training.
5020248 5021983 In a moment,<br />he'll demonstrate that
5022050 5023751 for the viewing audience<br />at home.
5024028 5027339 But first, Rocky, how did you come to<br />train in an icebox?
5028056 5030858 Uh, well, my friend,<br />the guy over there,
5030925 5033795 he let me in one day,<br />and I hit the beef here and liked it,
5033861 5035163 and since I've become<br />a challenger,
5035200 5037115 the owner don't mind<br />that I come in.
5037332 5038834 Is this a common<br />training method?
5038891 5041009 Do other fighters<br />pound raw meat?
5041536 5043171 No, I think I invented it.
5043238 5044486 Would you give us<br />a demonstration?
5044512 5045518 APOLLO:<br />Confirm the reservation
5045544 5049124 for my people at ringside,<br />and fly my barber to Philly.
5053047 5056084 How much is being channeled into West<br />Coast closed-circuit advertising?
5056151 5057285 300,000.
5057352 5058486 Make it 450.
5058553 5060955 And send the mayor's wife<br />200 roses from me,
5061022 5063791 and make sure we get a picture of it<br />for all the newspapers.
5063858 5066928 Do you want to run the 15 radio spots<br />in the Midwest?
5066994 5069597 You can spend your money better<br />in Canadian publicity.
5069664 5072400 By the way, Apollo,<br />I've got friends in Toronto
5072467 5074436 who can get you<br />a good tax break.
5074502 5076671 APOLLO: (LAUGHS)<br />George, I like your friends.
5076738 5078240 (ROCKY GRUNTING)
5084646 5089651 Hey, Champ. You ought to come look at<br />this boy you're gonna fight on TV.
5089717 5091319 Looks like he means business.
5091386 5092920 APOLLO:<br />Yeah, I mean business too.
5092987 5095157 Shirley, we got<br />any more coffee out there?
5095223 5097709 SHIRLEY: Certainly, Mr. Creed.<br />I'll get you some right away.
5097795 5100762 After the fight, I may retire<br />and run for emperor.

5167261 5168810 (CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING ON TV)<br />ADRIAN: And he called the reporters?
5169096 5171406 ROCKY: Yeah. Threw my training<br />schedule off.
5171733 5173508 Don't be mad at him.<br />He's trying to help.
5174175 5175770 Adrian, I ain't mad,
5175837 5179073 it's just that when reporters are around,<br />I get out of joint
5179140 5181797 'cause they take cheap shots,<br />and Paulie knows that.
5182744 5185847 And Paulie keeps asking me<br />for a job all the time
5185913 5187683 but he don't know<br />nothing about fighting.
5188750 5190052 Are you gonna say<br />anything to him?
5192019 5193321 What's to say?
5193388 5194960 I just don't know<br />what he wants from me.
5197759 5199505 I don't want<br />nothing from you.
5200762 5202397 I don't want<br />nothing from you.
5203898 5205457 This ain't no charity case.
5206468 5207769 Get out of my house.
5207835 5209177 It's not just your house.
5210805 5212010 You're no friend no more.
5213308 5214809 Get out of my house,<br />I just says.
5214876 5216278 Don't talk to him<br />like that.
5216344 5218246 Both of you<br />get out of my house!
5220982 5222717 It's cold outside, Paulie.
5232694 5234116 I don't want you messing her
5234862 5237182 and I don't raise you<br />to go with this scum bum!
5237499 5239301 Yeah? Come on!<br />You wanna hit on me?
5239367 5242197 Come on! I'll break both your arms<br />so they don't work for you.
5245540 5246641 Stop it!
5246708 5248443 I'm not good enough<br />to meet with Gazzo?
5248510 5250291 That's what I think of Gazzo!
5250347 5251596 Now you're<br />a big shot fighter,
5251633 5253729 you don't even throw<br />a crumb to your friend.
5254716 5256951 When I go and get your meat<br />every morning!
5257018 5259554 You forgot that? And then I even give you<br />my sister too!
5259621 5261122 Only a pig would say that!

5266834 5268370 I don't get married<br />because of you!
5269497 5271136 You can't live by yourself!

6065559 6067004 What is that?
6067461 6069796 I trained you to be<br />a fighter, not a billboard.
6069863 6071165 I'm doing it for a friend.
6071232 6072499 What do you get out of it?
6072566 6074468 Paulie gets $3,000.<br />I get the robe.
6074535 6075733 Shrewd.
6076370 6079039 The story about tonight's fight,<br />their difference in style,
6079106 6081375 you can quote a recent<br />sports magazine which said,
6081442 6083510 (CROWD CHEERING) it could be "the caveman<br />against the cavalier."
6083577 6085416 I notice a buzzing<br />in the background.
6085482 6088149 Could be the challenger<br />is getting ready to get into the ring.
6088215 6090417 Rocky, look at my date.
6090484 6092519 -Cost me $200.<br />-$250.
6092586 6094255 I gotta go.<br />I gotta work.
6094321 6096317 -How's the robe?<br />-A little baggy.
6096723 6099660 A 50-to-1 underdog<br />living a Cinderella story,
6099726 6103297 and he's captured people's imaginations<br />all over the world.

6111438 6112994 Thanks for showing up.
6113440 6115376 NAHAN: And his record,<br />44 victories.
6115442 6118011 He's had 38 by knockout,<br />and he's lost 20 fights.
6118078 6120481 BALDWIN: Which makes me wonder,<br />can he stand it?
6120547 6123217 You know, the stamina and the skill<br />to last three rounds.
6123284 6125252 Because Las Vegas<br />odds say no.

6140234 6141435 They have spotlights.

6152143 6153529 He's got the hat on,<br />the whole thing.
6155416 6157984 The world champion,<br />Apollo Creed
6158051 6160887 is doing an imitation<br />of George Washington.
6161855 6163557 He's throwing money.

6165132 6166690 we were taught<br />about George Washington
6166727 6167909 throwing a dollar.
6168736 6171258 If you threw a dollar in those days,<br />it went a lot farther.
6171325 6172833 Now he's taking his...
6172899 6174201 Blonde wig came off.

6442903 6444816 Right there. Bang.
6446473 6449936 The champ stinging the slower challenger<br />with jabs at will.
6449993 6453747 In fact, it looks like Rocky is blocking<br />the blows with his face.
6453814 6456016 The champion doesn't<br />look the best
6456082 6458218 he's ever been,<br />but he's moving now.
6458284 6460433 NAHAN:<br />The champion's smiling now.

6508034 6510904 Six, seven, eight.
6510971 6512123 He appears to be all right.
