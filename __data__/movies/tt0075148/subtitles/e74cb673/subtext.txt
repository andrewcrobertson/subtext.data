759210 761504 - Not the face!<br />- Mr. Gazzo wants the 200 now.
761586 762797 I'm broke!
762879 766048 Mr. Gazzo says I should get the 200<br />or break your thumb. You understand?
766134 768970 - Please, don't...<br />- What's your name again?
769802 772807 - Bob!<br />- Bob. Listen, Bob.
773850 776519 You wanna dance, you gotta pay the band.<br />You understand?
776600 778855 You wanna borrow,<br />you gotta pay the man.
778937 782316 Hey, I ain't emotionally involved, Bob.<br />You understand?
782399 785028 Give me some money.<br />Give me some money.
789615 791240 There's 130 here.
791325 793283 That's it. I'm broke.
793369 796788 Hey, Bob, you're still $70 light.
797288 800206 You don't have to break nothing.<br />Take my coat.
800293 802336 It's worth $50, $60.
802793 804464 Take the coat!
806048 807548 You know, you should've planned ahead.
807633 809759 You know that?<br />You should've planned ahead.
809844 812177 We'll fake it. I'll tape up the hand<br />like you broke the thumb!
812263 814849 - Should've planned ahead.<br />- Gazzo don't have to know!
814932 817975 He won't be wise to nothing!<br />Gazzo won't be wise to nothing!
818061 820855 Keep the coat! Keep the...
849884 854013 He only had 130, but I think he's good<br />for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
854096 856389 Sure, Rocky. Bob's good for it.
857642 859432 That's it for today.
860519 863815 Tomorrow collect from Del Rio.<br />He's late three weeks. I don't like it.
863898 866234 Tomorrow, three weeks. Del Rio?
866649 868860 All right, I got it.<br />How do you spell Del Rio?
868945 871239 - How'd you do last night?<br />- I did real good.
871322 872740 - Hey.<br />- What?
873240 875658 - Did you get the license number?<br />- Of what?
875743 877576 The truck that run over your face.
877662 879745 Relax, Buddy. Pull it over here.
879831 883292 I wanna let Rocky out.<br />I'm gonna talk to him for a few seconds.
906105 908024 Why didn't you break this guy's thumb?
908109 910403 - How do you know I didn't?<br />- You don't think I hear things?
910485 912278 Didn't I give you a job this morning?
912363 915240 - Yeah.<br />- Why didn't you break his thumb?
915322 919162 When you don't do what I tell you to do,<br />you make me look bad.
919326 922288 I figured... Look.<br />I figured if I break the guy's thumb,
922373 923706 he gets laid off.
923791 926668 - He can't make money.<br />- Let me do the figuring.
926753 929129 From here on in, let me do the figuring.
929211 933259 These guys think we're running a charity,<br />they'll get off light.
933341 935845 From here on in, do what I tell you to do,
935927 937427 because it's bad for my reputation.
937513 940264 You understand? You got it, Rock?
941307 942600 I got it.
945437 947480 How do you spell Del Rio?
947815 950317 - Look it up in a dictionary.<br />- Come on!
950399 953571 I won't let that happen no more,<br />about the thumb.
955447 956740 You know?
957865 959576 So long, meat bag.
962413 964666 I should've broke your thumbs!
994360 996489 Hey, Rock. Heard you did good last night.
996572 999615 - Absolutely. Should've seen me.<br />- Shouldn't you take a rest?
999701 1001576 - No, my back is hurt.<br />- Your back?
1001658 1003745 My back is hurt. You deaf?
1003830 1005373 No, I'm short.
1069979 1071519 Hey, yo, Mike.
1071894 1074567 Where's my lock?<br />Whose stuff is this in my locker?
1074650 1077862 It's Dipper's stuff.<br />It ain't your locker no more.
1080403 1083115 What you talking about?<br />It's been my locker for six years.
1083201 1084576 Where's my gear?
1084661 1087288 Mickey told me to bag it and hang it.
1091914 1094125 You put my stuff on skid row.
1094211 1098298 I been in that locker for six years,<br />and you put my stuff on skid row?
1098383 1100798 Mickey tells me what to do, I gotta do it.
1100884 1102303 Where is he?
1102384 1104806 He's outside working with Dipper.
1105010 1107266 - He's in a bad mood.<br />- So am I.
1117652 1119153 Keep your hands up.
1119237 1121989 Keep your hands up. Watch the right.
1122403 1123740 - Hey, Mick.<br />- Shut up!
1123825 1125990 To the body. Attaboy.
1129122 1131124 Time. Time!
1133084 1134750 What do you want?
1135000 1137171 - How you feeling today?<br />- What?
1137255 1139336 - How you feeling?<br />- Are you a doctor?
1139423 1142384 - You have problems today?<br />- Never mind. What's your problem?
1142468 1146471 I been talking to Michael.<br />How come I been put out of my locker?
1146556 1149932 Because Dipper needed it.<br />Dipper's a contender.
1150018 1152225 He's a climber.<br />Do you know what you are?
1152309 1154605 - You're a tomato.<br />- Tomato?
1154689 1157855 I run a business here,<br />not a goddamn soup kitchen.
1157942 1159902 - Did you fight last night?<br />- Yeah.
1159986 1162986 - Did you win?<br />- Yeah, I won K.O. In the second.
1163070 1164778 Yeah? Who'd you fight?
1164865 1166284 Spider Rico.
1166615 1168036 He's a bum!
1168741 1172202 - You think everybody I fight is a bum.<br />- Well, ain't they?
1172288 1175414 You got heart,<br />but you fight like a goddamn ape.
1175789 1178711 The only thing special about you,<br />you never got your nose busted.
1178796 1182508 Leave it that way. Nice and pretty<br />and what's left of your mind.
1182592 1185303 I think I'm gonna go take a steam.<br />You know why?
1185384 1188054 Because I did good last night,<br />and you should've seen me.
1188137 1190682 - Big deal.<br />- You should've seen me too.
1190767 1192057 Hey, kid.
1192477 1194979 - You ever think about retiring?<br />- No.
1195063 1196730 - You think about it.<br />- Yeah.

1250115 1252116 You need some help?
1252951 1255873 There's a good game<br />at the Spectrum tonight.
1258375 1260836 You wanna go to a basketball game?
1263961 1265758 Hi, Butkus. Hi, kid.
1268720 1271305 Tough day today.<br />They took my locker away.
1271385 1274182 I had that locker for six years.<br />It don't bother me.
1274267 1275807 Lockers are bad, anyway, after a while.
1275893 1277144 People get the combination.
1277228 1281105 I must've had 20 bucks<br />taken out of there in the past 6 years.
1281395 1284231 Don't sound like much, but it adds up.
1284317 1286362 Doesn't matter. Who cares?
1288278 1290573 Yeah, cold night. Hey, birds.
1290656 1293326 Hey, look who's here. Look who's here.
1293411 1294951 The giant worm.
1296163 1300375 Look at these birds.<br />Don't these birds look like flying candy?
1300460 1302293 Bird, you wanna fly me home?
1302376 1304881 You need somebody to walk you home?
1305131 1306298 - No.<br />- No?
1307048 1310928 It's a cold night.<br />If you got the money, take a cab.
1311009 1313135 Too many creeps around here.
1313765 1316307 Every other block, there's a creep.
1316642 1318807 You can always tell a creep.
1320894 1322690 Listen. I'm gonna go now, okay?
1322770 1324480 I'll see you later, all right?
1324567 1328359 None of you guys get up.<br />I know you had a hard day in the cage.
1328443 1329653 So,
1329903 1332659 I'm gonna go home, make up a joke.<br />I'll tell you a new joke tomorrow.
1332740 1334490 Okay? Good night, Adrian.
1334576 1336287 Good night, Rocky.
1355346 1357392 Don't know what happened.
1358643 1361558 Hey, there, Lefty. Got a friend for you here.

1369153 1371112 - Been fighting.<br />- Hope you won it, at least.
1371195 1373028 Oh, yeah, did real good.<br />You should've seen me.
1373115 1376076 <i>... heavyweight champion of the world</i><br /><i>Apollo Creed at Kennedy Airport...</i>
1376160 1378287 Hey, Rock, who'd you fight?
1378371 1379788 Spider Rico.
1380163 1382125 Jesus. Is he still around?
1382208 1385375 Yeah, he's doing real good.<br />He's doing better than you are.
1385461 1389086 Hey, Paulie. What, do you lock the door?<br />Yo, Paulie.
1389837 1392215 I'd like to kill the freaking moron<br />who broke the mirror.
1392298 1393928 Hey, yo, Paulie.
1394634 1399057 Every day, every night, I pass by.<br />Your sister's giving me the shoulder.
1399142 1400807 - Forget her.<br />- What do you mean?
1400893 1402894 - You can do better than her.<br />- I don't forget nothing.
1402979 1405019 Every night I pass by, I tell a joke.
1405105 1407730 Every morning I pass by, I tell a joke.
1407817 1409902 She just looks at me,<br />you know what I mean?
1409986 1412903 - Looks?<br />- Yeah, like I'm a plate of leftovers.
1412989 1414740 I need a Cadillac<br />to connect with your sister?
1414824 1417076 Something wrong with my face?
1417826 1419745 She's a freaking loser.
1419828 1423082 Sometimes she gets me so crazy,<br />I could split her head with a razor.
1423163 1426085 - Don't get mental.<br />- You caught me in a bad mood.
1426169 1429005 - You're always in a bad mood.<br />- Adrian ain't sharp.
1429086 1430961 Adrian is a loser.
1431048 1433423 She's pushing 30 freaking years old.
1433509 1435845 If she don't watch out,<br />she's gonna die alone.
1435928 1438554 - I'm 30 myself.<br />- And you'll die alone.
1438637 1440596 I don't see no crowd around you neither.
1440682 1442932 I'd like to kill the freaking moron<br />who broke the mirror.
1443019 1445644 Come on. Let's get out of this stink.
1446644 1449400 - I wanna talk to you anyway.<br />- About what?
1449480 1451903 - You still work for Gazzo?<br />- Yeah, sure.
1451986 1454489 Why don't you talk to him about me?
1454739 1457700 I just don't think Gazzo's hiring right now.
1458284 1460326 You know? Come on.
1464499 1466664 - The girl's drying up.<br />- Who?
1466750 1470336 My sister. If she don't start living,<br />her body's gonna dry up.
1470421 1472798 Tomorrow's Thanksgiving, you know that?
1472882 1475759 - Come over and talk to her.<br />- Sure. Beer.

1478221 1480471 Absolutely. You got it.
1481140 1483932 I gotta go. If I'm ten minutes late,<br />she calls the hospital.

1538448 1540654 You crazy?<br />This man is champion of the world.
1540740 1543411 He took his best shot and become champ.
1544076 1546076 What shot did you ever take?
1546163 1549375 Hey, Rocky,<br />you're not happy with your life, that's nice.
1549459 1552750 But me, I got a business going.<br />I don't have to take no shots.
1552836 1554836 <i>... no one having gone</i><br /><i>more than 12 rounds with him...</i>
1554922 1557633 - That's right.<br /><i>...and that was Jake Dale last June...</i>
1557717 1561429 - Stick that up your business.<br />- Why you getting so insulted?
1561971 1564596 You want me to take a shot? All right.
1564807 1566392 I'll take a shot.
1580028 1582529 - Hey, Rocky, how about a bottle?<br />- No wine, man.
1582615 1585826 - Come on. Just a little.<br />- Buy us some Thunderbird.
1587246 1589457 Marie, does your brother know<br />you're hanging out so late?
1589538 1591709 - Get lost, creep.<br />- Screw you, yo-yo!
1591789 1593836 These guys teach you to talk like that?
1593920 1596756 - Stuff it!<br />- Don't you never say that to me.
1597461 1600009 You stink up the neighborhood!
1601594 1603429 You know, you can...
1603554 1607807 When I was your age, only one girl in<br />the whole neighborhood talked like that.
1607892 1609769 That was it. Just one.
1609932 1613061 What are you doing?<br />It'll make your teeth yellow. Don't do that.
1613144 1614440 I like yellow teeth!
1614520 1616898 - It'll make your breath like garbage.<br />- Maybe I like garbage.
1616981 1618778 Nobody likes garbage.
1619192 1621696 Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth<br />wasn't bad looking,
1621779 1624279 but none of the guys ever took her serious.
1624365 1626201 They never took her out<br />for any serious date.
1626285 1627826 - Why?<br />- 'Cause that's the way guys are.
1627912 1629952 They laugh when you talk dirty.<br />They think you're cute.
1630038 1632706 After a while, you get a reputation.<br />You get no respect.
1632790 1635125 You understand? You get no respect.
1635211 1637922 I gotta use a bad word, whore.
1638006 1639923 You understand? Whore.
1640008 1643970 See? You use dirty words,<br />and maybe you end up becoming a whore.
1644345 1645971 Come on, Rocky. I'm 12.
1646055 1648432 That don't matter.
1648516 1651602 You don't really have to be one.<br />Just act like one and that's it.
1651682 1655355 Boom! Bing! You get a bad rep.<br />You understand?
1655690 1658981 Twenty years from now,<br />people are gonna say,
1659067 1661403 "Do you remember Marie?"<br />"No. Who was she?"
1661487 1664073 "She was the little whore who hung down<br />at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."
1664153 1666451 "Oh, yeah. Now I remember her."
1666534 1670038 You see, they don't remember you.<br />They remember the rep.
1670121 1671663 You understand?
1672663 1675960 You got a boyfriend?<br />No, you ain't got a boyfriend.
1676336 1679086 You know why?<br />Why don't you think you have a boyfriend?
1679172 1681962 'Cause you're hanging out with them<br />coconuts on the corner.
1682048 1683840 You hang around coconuts,<br />you get nowhere.
1683924 1685678 They're lemons. Lemons.
1685759 1688806 You hang out with nice people,<br />you get nice friends. You understand?
1688890 1691351 You hang out with smart people,<br />you get smart friends.
1691432 1693978 You hang out with yo-yo people,<br />you get yo-yo friends.
1694058 1696480 You see, it's simple mathematics.
1697315 1698816 - I hope you ain't...<br />- I won't.
1698900 1699980 What was I gonna say?
1700067 1703112 You hope I don't keep acting<br />like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
1703192 1704278 Yeah, something like that.
1704364 1705490 Good night, Rocky.
1705573 1707865 - Good night. Take care.<br />- Hey, Rocky.
1707950 1710576 - Yo.<br />- Screw you, creep-o!
1718500 1721297 Yeah, who are you to give advice, creep-o?
1721381 1722798 Who are you?
1741651 1744862 - Are the doctor's reports confirmed?<br />- Definitely.
1745113 1746990 Says here Mac Lee Green has suffered
1747073 1750576 "a severely cracked third metacarpal<br />in his left hand."
1751076 1752412 Damn!
1752576 1756582 We can cancel the fight indefinitely<br />if you're set on fighting Green.
1756663 1758710 Hey, it ain't just Green.
1759000 1761336 What about all the time<br />Apollo has invested?
1761421 1763086 We can find a solution.
1763172 1764256 Solution nothing.
1764339 1767048 Find me another ranked contender<br />in a flash, Jergens.
1767134 1769095 Don't play games with my client.
1769178 1771760 Apollo's already done a million dollars'<br />worth of publicity,
1771846 1774767 has made contractual obligations<br />with 20 different organizations.
1774851 1776557 He's not going to be embarrassed!
1776644 1779019 I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.
1779105 1781065 Ernie's fighting in France that same week.
1781145 1783274 Then get me Buddy Shaw.<br />He's ranked fifth.
1783357 1786192 Went to California and gained 50 pounds.
1786778 1788653 I called every worthwhile contender.
1788740 1792701 They all say five weeks isn't enough time<br />to get into shape.
1792785 1795288 Shape nothing, man. They're afraid.
1795413 1797413 They know everybody<br />is gonna see this fight.
1797498 1799288 None of them's got<br />a prayer of whipping me.
1799375 1803418 They're making excuses so they don't<br />have to be the chump who gets whipped.
1803502 1806132 All I can say is I'm a good promoter.
1806632 1809798 I've promoted fights<br />in every goddamn country in the world
1809884 1812053 and I've broken my ass over this one.
1812136 1814346 I don't know what else to do!
1819933 1821105 I do.
1823441 1827403 Without a ranked contender,<br />what this fight needs is a novelty.
1827817 1830278 This is the land of opportunity, right?
1830365 1832784 So, Apollo Creed, on January 1st,
1832865 1835951 gives a local underdog fighter<br />an opportunity.
1836663 1841000 A snow-white underdog, and I'm gonna<br />put his face on this poster with me.
1841084 1842960 And I'll tell you why.
1843044 1845046 Because I'm sentimental.
1845380 1848132 A lot of other people in this country<br />are just as sentimental
1848212 1851009 and there's nothing they'd like better<br />than to see Apollo Creed
1851094 1854221 give a local Philadelphia boy<br />a shot at the greatest title in the world
1854305 1856639 on this country's biggest birthday.
1856722 1858807 Now that's the way I see it
1859143 1861394 and that's the way it's gonna be.
1861479 1863144 Apollo, I like it.
1863644 1865400 It's very American.
1866105 1869112 No, Jergens. It's very smart.
1893678 1895846 - What is it?<br />- I wanna check this thing out.
1895930 1899682 You said pick up two yards from Snyder<br />and a grand from Cappoli, right?
1899767 1903855 No, no. Two yards from Cappoli<br />and a grand from Snyder.
1903938 1905687 - Two yards.<br />- Write it down, okay?
1905771 1907355 Yeah, I got it.
1907442 1910862 Who's this girl you're going out with<br />tomorrow night?
1911028 1913193 - How'd you know?<br />- I know.
1913278 1916409 Don't you think I hear things?<br />Lot of canaries flying around the docks.
1916490 1918701 - I'm going out with Paulie's sister.<br />- Hey, Rocky.
1918786 1920997 - What?<br />- I hear she's retarded.
1921201 1923249 She ain't retarded. She's shy, you know?
1923333 1927875 Tell you what to do. Take her to the zoo.<br />I hear retards like the zoo.
1927961 1929836 - This bum gotta say that?<br />- Who you calling a bum?
1929922 1931712 - Back it up, Buddy.<br />- I'm calling you a bum!
1931798 1935094 Relax, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood.<br />It's his prostate.
1935178 1938260 He's always in a bad mood.<br />You ought to count your blessings.
1938346 1940014 You're still a healthy person.
1940098 1942307 - I don't like your face.<br />- I don't like yours either!
1942393 1944433 - Kiss my ass!<br />- Come out here!
1944519 1947063 Relax! Relax. My ears.
1947147 1949776 Are you driving me crazy? Both of you.
1949980 1952567 Look. Buddy doesn't like you.
1953067 1955903 Some guys, they just hate for no reason.<br /><i>Capisce?</i>
1955990 1957659 - Yeah.<br />- Come here.
1959160 1962493 Here's 50 bucks. You and your girl Adrian,<br />you have a nice time.
1962577 1963788 Thanks.
1965038 1967039 How'd you know her name?
1967125 1969375 You don't think I hear things?
1970086 1971461 - Hey, Rock.<br />- What?
1971547 1972879 - Remember what I told you?<br />- What'd you tell me?
1972963 1974092 Take her to the zoo.
1974173 1976094 Come on out of the car!
1982596 1985894 - Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?<br />- No, thanks, Shirley.
1986558 1988355 What do you think about Billy Snow?
1988439 1989605 Fouls.
1991105 1992981 How about Big Chuck Smith?
1993067 1995113 No, he's too old and dull.
1995278 1997196 Hey, that Bobby Judge, he's a good boy.
1997279 1998990 No. I don't feel no heat from that name.
1999075 2001201 Joe Zack's a good prospect.
2002451 2005288 Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
2006374 2008625 This is what I'm looking for.
2008789 2010875 The Italian Stallion.
2011295 2013711 Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.
2014173 2016217 Look, it's the name, man.
2016298 2018298 The Italian Stallion.
2019220 2020884 The media will eat it up.
2020971 2023807 Who discovered America?<br />An Italian, right?
2024142 2027644 What would be better than to get it on<br />with one of his descendants?
2027729 2029188 He's a southpaw.
2029269 2030980 I don't want you messing around<br />with southpaws.
2031065 2033148 - They do everything backwards.<br />- Southpaw nothing.
2033232 2035153 I'll drop him in three.
2036237 2039990 Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.
2041784 2043866 Sounds like a damn monster movie.
2044201 2046247 What are you doing with that bat?
2046327 2047999 I used to be deadly at stickball.
2048082 2050914 - Your sister knows I'm coming?<br />- She's very excited.
2051294 2053375 - Look at these swollen hands.<br />- Yeah.
2053461 2056882 The joints from carrying meat<br />in and out of the freezer.
2056965 2060177 - Plays hell on the joints.<br />- Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
2060260 2062179 I don't need a doctor.<br />I need a different job.
2062262 2064681 Different job. What kind of turkey?<br />Big? Small?
2064766 2068143 Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a good man.
2068226 2071271 Nothing bothers me.<br />I'd make a great collector.
2071356 2073358 Busting bones don't bother me.
2073440 2075818 Don't bother you. Big turkey, right?
2075902 2078905 Gazzo's gotta give me... Forget Gazzo.<br />It's a bad job.
2078987 2080530 You got a match?
2080614 2082532 Go to him for me. As a favor.
2082617 2085369 Yeah, yeah. Last time I had a turkey
2085452 2088956 was when they had a two-dollar special<br />at Horn and Hardart's three years ago.
2089039 2091541 Last year, me and the turtles had Spam.
2099800 2103721 - Your sister knows I'm coming?<br />- Yeah, yeah. She's very excited.
2107099 2109476 Will you forget about Gazzo?
2110143 2111646 I don't ask nobody twice.
2111728 2113648 Don't ask nobody twice.
2119152 2121114 You're sure your sister knows I'm coming?
2121197 2123239 Yeah. She's very excited.
2126911 2128663 Paulie, you're late.
2129706 2130998 You call the hospital?
2131081 2134168 She calls the hospital<br />if I'm ten minutes late.
2135085 2136795 Yo, how you doing?
2137880 2140257 I told you, she's very excited.
2142844 2145179 Why didn't you tell me<br />you were bringing him here?
2145262 2146847 I'm not ready for this.
2146931 2149349 Would it make a difference if you were?
2149434 2151893 - He's taking you out.<br />- No, I can't.
2153186 2155940 I want you out of the kitchen right now.
2156606 2157858 I won't.
2162739 2165282 I want you out of here instamatically!
2165364 2167994 I'm sick of seeing you<br />hanging around like a freaking spider.
2168077 2170246 Go out and live. Enjoy life!
2170454 2172081 I can't go!
2172164 2174083 Don't get wise with me now.
2174166 2175876 I'm tired of you being a loser.
2175960 2178128 Don't call me that, Paulie!
2178210 2181132 <i>Apollo Creed says he'll be shopping</i><br /><i>for another victim</i>
2181215 2184969 <i>to fill Green's vacancy</i><br /><i>for the Bicentennial championship fight...</i>
2185052 2186762 Why didn't you tell me<br />you were bringing him home?
2186846 2188139 How do you know I didn't?
2188222 2191059 I can't go, Paulie. I won't go!
2191141 2192226 Why?
2193226 2196688 Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.<br />I got a turkey in the oven.
2197398 2199442 Oh, a turkey in the oven.
2206157 2207909 Turkey in the oven.
2214998 2218710 You want the bird?<br />Go in the alley and eat the bird!
2219335 2220797 Aw, Paulie!
2221797 2224759 I want you out of here!<br />Get out of the house!
2225009 2227552 Go out and enjoy your freaking life!
2231766 2233434 You hungry, Rock?
2240108 2243820 Hey, yo, Paulie, maybe we better<br />forget all this, you know?
2244320 2247447 Forget nothing. Go ahead.<br />Tell her something funny.
2247532 2250702 Ain't nothing to talk about.<br />She's in a bad mood. I'm in a bad mood.
2250784 2253538 You can do funny things.<br />You wanna go out with my sister?
2253621 2255164 - Yeah.<br />- Well...
2259376 2261003 I don't know what to say.
2261085 2262255 Funny.
2273891 2276018 Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky.
2276393 2278061 Rocky, you know?
2278730 2279938 Listen,
2282233 2286695 I don't know what to say, 'cause I ain't<br />never talked to no door before.
2287864 2291074 What do I say to a door?<br />We better forget this.
2291409 2292577 You're doing fine.
2292659 2294996 I ain't doing fine. I look like an idiot.
2295079 2297081 Keep doing what you're doing. Funny.
2297164 2299375 I know all about these things.
2299458 2301210 I feel like a jerk.
2307215 2309635 Yo, Adrian, it's Rocky again.
2309719 2314306 Listen, I know you ain't too happy<br />at this moment.
2314849 2316516 But could you do me a favor?
2316601 2319603 I ain't got nobody<br />to spend Thanksgiving with.
2319771 2323106 So, how about maybe you and I
2323190 2324983 go out together, get something to eat.
2325068 2327612 Maybe laugh a little bit.<br />Who knows, you know?
2327695 2329447 Would you like to...
2331282 2334117 Would you like to, maybe,<br />you and me go out together?
2334202 2336788 What do you think? Would you like to?
2341793 2344003 We're gonna have a good time.
2344378 2346547 We'll have a real good time.
2351094 2352887 Thanks for the bird.
2356516 2359434 I'm gonna turn the TV off.<br />I got a headache.
2371780 2374199 - What's your sister like to do?<br />- Ice-skate.
2374282 2376284 Adrian, come on.<br />You're letting the heat out.
2376369 2378663 Who pays the bills around here?
2384251 2387380 Listen, I don't want no turkey anyway,<br />you know?
2388965 2390967 But it was Thanksgiving.
2391800 2392927 What?
2393010 2394971 - It was Thanksgiving.<br />- Yeah, to you.
2395054 2397347 But to me it's Thursday, right?
2421706 2424375 - It looks kind of quiet.<br />- I think it's closed.
2424458 2427585 No, I think we're just early<br />or something like that.
2429005 2430840 - We're closed.<br />- What?
2431172 2434135 - I said we're closed.<br />- Yeah. Hey, listen.
2434217 2437554 I'm gonna smooth this guy out. Wait here.<br />I'll be right back.
2437764 2439556 - We could go someplace else.<br />- No, it's okay.
2439639 2443603 Are you closed to the general public,<br />or are you just closed to everybody?
2443686 2447856 It's after 6:00. It's Thanksgiving.<br />That's why there's nobody here.
2448190 2450233 Besides, you ain't supposed to be in here.
2450318 2452820 So do me a favor and not stay here.
2452902 2456449 - Could you do me a favor?<br />- Come on. We're not operating.
2456699 2459534 Look. This girl here ain't feeling well.
2459619 2462163 Doctors say she should go out<br />and exercise.
2462246 2464373 Ice-skating's probably the best thing.
2464456 2465708 So what do you want from me?
2465791 2467668 Well, hey, I want you to do me a favor.
2467751 2469335 You can see she ain't feeling too good.
2469420 2472422 If you can let her on the ice<br />for a few minutes, I'd appreciate it.
2472507 2474300 Ten minutes, ten bucks.
2474384 2476552 Ten bucks? How about eight bucks?
2476635 2478762 Come on. It's Thanksgiving.
2479012 2480889 All right. Nine bucks, you got a deal.
2480972 2483726 You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.
2485853 2487605 Give her the blades.
2488398 2489690 Aren't you skating?
2489773 2491733 No, I ain't skated since I was 15.
2491818 2494112 That's when I started fighting.
2494402 2497072 Skating's kind of bad for the ankles,<br />you know?
2498032 2500784 You're a pretty good skater, aren't you?
2501577 2504079 Like I was saying<br />before on the way over here,
2504163 2507333 fighting used to be tops with me,<br />but no more.
2507416 2509918 All I wanted to do out of fighting<br />was prove I was no bum,
2510003 2512422 that I had the stuff to make a good pro.
2512505 2515507 - You never got the chance?<br />- I ain't crying about it.
2515590 2517844 I still fight. I do it like a hobby.
2517927 2520096 The trouble is I'm a southpaw.
2520179 2523099 - What's a southpaw?<br />- A southpaw means you're left-handed.
2523181 2525559 A southpaw throws your timing off.
2525643 2527936 It throws other guys' timing off,<br />makes them look awkward.
2528021 2529605 Nobody wants to look awkward.
2529688 2532858 - You know where "southpaw" came from?<br />- Nine minutes!
2532942 2535987 A long time ago, there was this guy,<br />maybe a couple hundred years ago,
2536070 2539532 he was fighting in the...<br />I think it was around Philadelphia.
2539614 2543577 His arm... He was left-handed.<br />His arm was facing towards New Jersey.
2543661 2547498 And that's south. So naturally<br />they called him "south paw." You see?
2547581 2550876 Southpaw, South Jersey, South Camden.
2551335 2553170 Southpaw. You know what I mean?
2554672 2556797 Things probably worked out for the best,<br />don't you think?
2556882 2559552 Never got a chance<br />because you're left-handed, huh?
2559635 2561721 That's absolutely true, you know?
2561804 2563056 Watch out.
2565056 2568101 Ah! Ah! I just dislocated my finger.
2568436 2569978 Ah! Look at that.
2570730 2572523 Wait. It ain't your fault. Look.
2572606 2574983 See? I had it... It's an old wound.
2575068 2577320 You see that? Look. See?
2577402 2578820 Nothing. It bends like that.
2578905 2581864 I originally done it... Push the button.<br />Bong. It works.
2581949 2584827 - It ain't your fault. Look.<br />- Seven minutes!
2585577 2588581 I originally done it...<br />I carry pictures of all my fights.
2588664 2591416 I originally done it<br />in the Baby Crenshaw fight.
2591501 2594545 Baby's about the size of an airplane.<br />I broke both hands on his face.
2594628 2598007 I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,<br />don't you think?
2598090 2599425 Real nice.
2600885 2603262 Come on. You having a good time?
2603971 2605889 You can see I ain't too graceful.
2605972 2610353 I don't move well, but I can really swat.<br />I can really hit hard.
2610436 2614106 But I'm a southpaw,<br />and nobody wants to fight no southpaw.
2619320 2622072 You know how I got started in fighting?
2622155 2623239 No.
2624032 2625952 Am I talking too loud?
2626244 2627829 Three minutes!
2627911 2632458 My father, he's a...<br />My old man, he was never too smart.
2632541 2634626 He says to me,<br />"You weren't born with much of a brain,
2634710 2637213 "so you better start using your body."
2637295 2639215 So I become a fighter.
2639882 2641634 You know what I mean?
2641717 2643552 Why you laughing?
2644887 2647806 My mother, she said the opposite thing.
2647889 2650143 What did she say the opposite?
2650768 2653061 She said,<br />"You weren't born with much of a body,
2653146 2654896 "so you better develop your brain."
2654981 2657733 - Did she say that?<br />- Yo, time!
2659027 2661902 - Can I ask you a question?<br />- Absolutely.
2663155 2666576 - Why do you wanna fight?<br />- 'Cause I can't sing or dance.
2668244 2669954 Don't fall!
2671204 2673623 That was terrific. I'm pretty good at this.
2673708 2674958 You like the way I skate?
2675043 2678085 Last fight I had,<br />I had with this guy named Spider Rico.
2678170 2680882 He busted my head up there.<br />You see that scar?
2680965 2683967 I'll tell you,<br />things get pretty rough in the ring.
2693436 2696396 You know,<br />some people are very shy by nature.
2697315 2698690 I suppose.
2701610 2704489 I say you're very shy by nature, you know?
2705739 2707114 I suppose.
2709786 2711536 The bum from the dark.
2711621 2713289 Get a job, you bum!
2714123 2717001 Some people think<br />that being shy is a disease,
2717085 2719045 but it don't bother me none.
2719128 2721047 Don't bother me either.
2722382 2724509 So why'd I bother bringing it up?
2724592 2726760 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.
2728012 2730056 I think we make<br />a sharp couple of coconuts.
2730139 2732974 I'm dumb and you're shy.<br />What do you think?
2735228 2738815 I don't understand<br />why anybody would wanna be a fighter.
2739148 2744445 You gotta be a moron to wanna<br />be a fighter, you know what I mean?
2744987 2748489 It's a racket where you're<br />almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
2748574 2751994 - I don't think you're a bum.<br />- I'm at least half a bum.
2752202 2754371 But I'll tell you something.
2755248 2757833 Worst thing about fighting<br />is the morning after.
2757916 2759293 - You know?<br />- Morning after.
2759376 2761253 Yeah, the morning after a fight,
2761335 2763880 you're like a large wound,<br />you know what I mean?
2763965 2766009 Sometimes I got pains all over me.
2766092 2769804 I feel like calling a taxi to take me<br />from the bed into the bathroom.
2769887 2771764 Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt.
2771847 2774726 Your face is busted up.<br />Your hands are swollen.
2774809 2777893 Look at this face. Sixty-four fights.<br />Look at that nose.
2777978 2780731 You see that nose?<br />That nose ain't never been broken.
2780815 2783150 I had guys busting on it.
2783233 2786277 I had guys chewing on it,<br />twisting and punching it.
2786362 2787947 I mean, whack, boom.
2788030 2790532 These guys are hitting my nose<br />all the time.
2790614 2792577 Never broke it. I'm very proud of that.
2792659 2794244 That's rare.
2794329 2797373 - Why do you do it if it hurts?<br />- Why you think?
2798791 2801418 'Cause you can't sing and dance?
2801710 2804213 Yeah, something like that.
2804297 2806422 Hey, you wanna come inside?
2808760 2810010 No, I gotta go.
2810094 2812054 Hey, come on. I got some animals.
2812137 2814556 I got these very rare animals inside.
2814639 2816224 Come on in.
2816309 2817726 No, I gotta go.
2817809 2820646 I gotta go, too, to the bathroom. Come on.
2821230 2822398 Come on.
2822481 2824233 No, I gotta go.
2824317 2827945 Look at this face.<br />Is that a face you could trust or what?
2828237 2832407 Is it? They ought to stick this face<br />on a stamp. What do you think?
2832992 2834577 Come on in.
2840166 2841583 Yo, come on.
2862313 2863523 Click.
2869152 2870947 Yo, Adrian, you hungry?
2871030 2872407 No.
2872489 2874157 I got some things in there.
2874242 2877119 If you like sodas, doughnuts or something.
2877286 2879454 Got a couple cupcakes. Huh?
2879664 2880748 No?
2881081 2883626 I got some chocolate in there. No?
2892300 2894219 Hot in here, you know?
2896304 2898431 I could go for some music.
2904063 2905481 Yo, Adrian.
2905898 2908735 These are the exotic animals<br />I was telling you about.
2908818 2910945 These are my friends, Cuff and Link.
2911027 2913780 - I sold them to you.<br />- I know you sold them to me.
2913864 2916367 Remember you were working<br />at that pet shop?
2916451 2919911 First day you was there, and I came in<br />and bought both these animals?
2919996 2921121 I remember that.
2921204 2924916 I bought this bowl<br />and the animals themselves.
2925001 2927585 Some food,<br />the marbles that go on the bottom there.
2927670 2929630 Remember that mountain?
2929713 2933885 I had to get rid of that mountain.<br />They kept fall over and flipping.
2937304 2940141 Why don't you come over here<br />and sit down?
2942351 2944728 It's a nice couch. I don't know.
2946898 2949983 There's big bugs in there.<br />It's safer over here.
2952570 2954322 You wanna sit down?
2961036 2962579 These your parents?
2962664 2964916 Yeah, that's both of them there.
2964998 2967668 - Is this you?<br />- Yeah. I was eight years old.
2967751 2970838 That's the Italian Stallion<br />when he was a baby.
2973007 2976219 Come on over.<br />Make yourself comfortable. Relax.
2981681 2982974 Do you have a phone?
2983059 2984936 No, I had it pulled.
2985018 2986853 'Cause people calling all the time,
2986938 2989648 and who needs the aggravation, right?
2989731 2991233 Interruptions.
2991608 2993360 Who'd you wanna call?
2993443 2996155 I wanna let my brother know where I am.
2996947 2998032 Why?
2999701 3001369 I think he might be worried.
3001452 3004539 I'll call your brother, if that's the problem.
3007000 3009251 Yo, Paulie! Your sister's with me!
3009335 3011963 I'll call you back later! See you!
3018594 3020887 You don't like the room, do you?
3020972 3023891 - It's fine.<br />- It's only temporary.
3024559 3026101 It's not that.
3031023 3034068 What's the problem? You don't like me?
3034152 3036362 You don't like the turtles?<br />What's the problem?
3036445 3039197 - I don't think I belong here.<br />- It's okay.
3041992 3043786 I don't belong here.
3044454 3047748 Well, you know, it's okay,<br />'cause you're my guest.
3048875 3051878 I don't know you well enough.
3051960 3055255 I've never been<br />in a man's apartment alone.
3057090 3059927 Well, they're all the same, you know?
3065099 3067684 I'm not sure I know you well enough.
3069061 3071105 I don't feel comfortable.
3071271 3074150 Yo, Adrian, I ain't so comfortable either.
3076568 3078112 I should go.
3078195 3080489 Don't go, please. Don't go.
3082532 3083826 Don't go.
3087413 3089039 Do me a favor.
3089123 3090333 What?
3090416 3092335 Take off these glasses.
3096005 3098297 You have nice eyes, you know?
3100134 3101927 Do me another favor?
3102929 3105306 Why don't you take off that hat?
3111603 3113815 I always knew you was pretty.
3115358 3117985 - Don't tease me.<br />- I'm not teasing you.
3121364 3123157 I ain't teasing you.
3124242 3126869 I just wanna... I wanna kiss you.
3129496 3132541 You don't have to kiss me back<br />if you don't wanna,
3132625 3134460 but I wanna kiss you.
3206864 3209911 - Heard you had a fight coming up.<br />- Next month.
3209994 3211746 January 27, right?
3211829 3213748 That's good. Come down to the gym.
3213831 3216125 We'll get you in shape.<br />How's your weight?
3216208 3219085 - 175.<br />- Hey, Rock. How you doing?
3219170 3221338 Mick was looking for you up there, man.
3221422 3223632 - For me? You're sure?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
3223715 3225842 He's looking for you.<br />Get up there and see him.
3225927 3228346 - He wanted me?<br />- Yeah. Your name's Rock, right?
3228429 3230347 - Yeah.<br />- All right. Go on, babe.
3244652 3246489 You got something for me?
3246572 3249409 Yeah, there was some guy<br />from Miles Jergens looking for you.
3249492 3252954 They need sparring partners<br />for Apollo Creed. There's the card.
3253036 3254746 - When was he here?<br />- About an hour ago.
3254831 3258126 They're probably looking<br />for sparring partners for Creed.
3258208 3260628 I said that before, you dumb Dago!
3262170 3265382 I been coming here for six years,<br />and six years you been sticking it to me.
3265465 3267969 - How come?<br />- You don't wanna know!
3268052 3269804 Yeah, I wanna know how come.
3269887 3271931 - You wanna know?<br />- I wanna know now!
3272014 3274056 Okay, I'm gonna tell you!
3274141 3278186 You had the talent to become<br />a good fighter, and instead of that,
3278271 3282400 you became a leg breaker<br />for some cheap, second-rate loan shark!
3283318 3284485 It's a living.
3284568 3286402 It's a waste of life!
3305005 3306797 Yes. May I help you?
3312054 3314599 Oh, you must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.
3314681 3317518 Mr. Jergens's expecting you.<br />Just a moment.
3322690 3325108 Mr. Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.
3325652 3326777 Fine.
3327527 3330030 - Please go in, Mr. Balboa.<br />- Can I have that?
3330114 3332532 - Oh, certainly.<br />- Thanks.
3337329 3338706 Mr. Balboa.
3339456 3341250 How are you? George Jergens.
3341333 3342960 Take a chair, please.
3343043 3344253 Thanks.
3346088 3347507 Mr. Balboa.
3348047 3349925 Call me Rocky.
3350009 3352052 Rocky, you got any representation?
3352135 3353637 You have a manager?
3353721 3355139 No, just me.
3356766 3360561 Rocky, I've got a proposition<br />I'd like to make to you.
3361018 3364190 - About sparring?<br />- Beg your pardon?
3364273 3368735 I know you're looking for<br />sparring partners, and I'm very available.
3368945 3370780 - I'm sure you are.<br />- Absolutely.
3370862 3372364 Sparring with the champ<br />would be an honor,
3372447 3373699 and you know what, Mr. Jergens?
3373782 3375659 - What?<br />- I wouldn't take no cheap shots.
3375742 3377911 I'd really be a good sparring partner.
3377996 3380289 You don't understand me, Rocky.
3380706 3382583 My proposition's this.
3383418 3385835 Would you be interested<br />in fighting Apollo Creed
3385920 3388630 for the world heavyweight championship?
3393219 3394387 No.
3394469 3396014 Listen, Rocky.
3396931 3398931 Apollo's seen you fight.
3399766 3401393 He likes you.
3401476 3403228 He wants to fight you.
3403313 3405106 Well, it's just that, you see,
3405188 3408318 I fight in clubs, you know,<br />and I'm really a ham-and-egger.
3408400 3410277 This guy, he's the best, and
3410360 3413947 it wouldn't be such a good fight,<br />but thank you very much.
3414489 3415907 I appreciate it.
3415992 3420329 Rocky, do you believe that America<br />is the land of opportunity?
3421789 3422873 Yeah.
3423708 3425418 Apollo Creed does,
3425793 3427753 and he's gonna prove it to the whole world
3427835 3430547 by giving an unknown a shot at the title.
3431047 3433050 And that unknown is you.
3433800 3435635 He picked you, Rocky.
3436804 3439097 It's the chance of a lifetime.
3440224 3442143 You can't pass it by.
3443436 3445063 What do you say?
3450943 3452027 <i>All right, fellas. That's enough pictures.</i>
3452110 3453945 <i>We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.</i>
3454030 3456574 <i>Apollo, how do you like</i><br /><i>the City of Brotherly Love?</i>
3456657 3460077 <i>Well, just being in Philadelphia</i><br /><i>makes me feel patriotic.</i>
3460161 3462871 <i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city</i><br /><i>coming up to me on the street,</i>
3462954 3464123 <i>wishing me the best.</i>
3464206 3466958 <i>I love my Philadelphia brothers,</i><br /><i>and I'm proud to be an American.</i>
3467043 3468585 <i>Apollo? Champ?</i>
3468670 3472507 <i>Why did you agree to fight a man</i><br /><i>who has virtually no chance of winning?</i>
3472590 3474884 <i>If history proves one thing,</i>
3474967 3478721 <i>American history proves that</i><br /><i>everybody's got a chance to win.</i>
3478804 3481931 <i>Didn't you guys ever hear</i><br /><i>of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>
3482016 3483518 <i>Apollo?</i>
3483601 3486143 <i>It is a coincidence</i><br /><i>that you're fighting a white man</i>
3486228 3488188 <i>on the most celebrated day</i><br /><i>in the country's history?</i>
3488271 3491483 <i>I don't know. Is it a coincidence</i><br /><i>that he's fighting a black man</i>
3491567 3493902 <i>on the most celebrated day</i><br /><i>in the country's history?</i>
3493987 3495989 <i>- Right on, Apollo!</i><br /><i>- Tell the truth, brother!</i>
3496072 3498657 <i>Listen, Apollo.</i><br /><i>How do you feel about your challenger?</i>
3498739 3501494 <i>How do I feel about him? Come here, Rock.</i>
3501952 3503286 <i>My main man.</i>
3503371 3506039 <i>- Rocky, ain't you Italian?</i><br /><i>- Yeah, I'm Italian.</i>
3506123 3507833 <i>Now what does that mean?</i>
3507916 3510795 <i>That means, if he can't fight,</i><br /><i>I'll bet he can cook.</i>
3512505 3515047 Do me a favor. His lungs, punch out.
3515132 3516550 Paulie.
3516634 3519846 <i>Rocky, how do you expect</i><br /><i>to fight Apollo Creed?</i>
3520387 3522639 <i>Oh, jeez, you know, Creed's the best.</i>
3522724 3524391 <i>I guess I'll have to do the best I can.</i>
3524474 3527143 <i>Tell me, Rocky, just between us,</i>
3527228 3530273 <i>where did you get</i><br /><i>the name "Italian Stallion"?</i>
3530356 3534777 <i>Oh, I invented that about eight years ago</i><br /><i>when I was eating dinner.</i>
3534860 3539657 <i>Rocky, now your payday will be $150,000.</i>
3539782 3541199 <i>Any comment?</i>
3543411 3546331 <i>- You got no comment, Rocky, right?</i><br /><i>- No.</i>
3546414 3547873 <i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i><br /><i>- Wait a minute.</i>
3547956 3550876 <i>I just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, okay?</i>
3550960 3553045 <i>Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky.</i>
3554172 3556922 <i>You believe all this?</i><br /><i>Microphones and all that stuff.</i>
3557007 3558134 You didn't.
3558217 3560552 <i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i><br /><i>- Who you pushing, man?</i>
3560635 3562972 <i>- Smack you in the mouth!</i><br /><i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>
3563056 3564931 Don't it matter he making you out a fool?
3565016 3566601 I'd break his lips.
3566726 3570355 - He's taking cheap shots.<br />- Don't bother me none.
3570438 3575275 Yo, Rocky, I guess you'll be looking<br />for people to help you out.
3575360 3576652 Help what?
3576735 3577945 You know,
3578027 3579947 keep you living the clean life.
3580030 3582282 I do okay, you know.
3582367 3584327 You need someone<br />to help with the exercise
3584409 3588246 and someone standing by with a towel<br />or running errands?
3588331 3591083 Hey, yo, Paulie,<br />who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.
3591166 3593753 So I just think I'm gonna train myself,<br />you know?
3593835 3596005 Without such good people around<br />to help you,
3596088 3598547 you don't have such a good chance.
3598675 3601260 Einstein flunked out of school twice.
3601594 3602804 That so?
3602969 3606849 Yeah. Beethoven was deaf.<br />Helen Keller was blind.
3607431 3609851 I think Rocky's got a good chance.
3615565 3617652 Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?
3617735 3621489 You looking to do a good deed?<br />Keep out of my freaking life!
3622407 3624282 - What'd I do?<br />- Nothing.
3624367 3625952 Did I say something wrong?
3626034 3627786 You didn't say nothing. It's all right.
3627869 3629871 That's right! You didn't say nothing!
3629956 3631498 Nothing at all!
3633501 3634918 I gotta go.
3636085 3638463 Where are the freaking pretzels?
3641509 3643469 I'd like to have a pretzel.
3643552 3645637 Hey, we ain't got any beer?
3646514 3649684 I thought you were supposed to<br />pick up some beer!
3657525 3660152 How'd you like hearing your name<br />on TV tonight?
3661902 3663405 I was shocked.
3663489 3664907 Why'd you do that?
3664989 3666742 You're putting me on, right?
3666826 3668202 Absolutely.
3668994 3671748 - What time should I expect you?<br />- About 7:00.
3671831 3673750 - Okay.<br />- Hey.
3691266 3694728 You know how I said<br />that stuff on TV didn't bother me?
3695146 3696271 Yeah.
3698733 3700025 It did.
3710661 3714248 Listen, the reason I brought you here<br />is because
3714331 3716668 I wanna know if you got any money<br />for training expenses.
3716751 3718503 I got a few dollars.
3718585 3720838 A few bucks? Here. Put this in your glove.
3720922 3723965 - What's this?<br />- $500. Don't worry about it.
3725217 3727135 You know, you ain't never had any luck,
3727219 3729722 but I think this time Lady Luck<br />may be in your corner.
3729806 3732724 - What do you think?<br />- Maybe.
3732809 3734726 Thanks for the money, Tony.
3734811 3737896 It's okay. Don't worry about it. I'll see you.
3738188 3739983 - Wait a minute.<br />- What?
3740065 3742193 You're in training. Come on.
3750326 3751952 - Yo, Tony.<br />- What?
3752869 3755081 You gonna show up at the fight?
3755164 3756456 Ringside.
3758876 3760378 I'll see you.
3795621 3796748 Yeah.
3802253 3805757 Hello, kid. I seen your light. Can I come in?
3805840 3808134 - Yeah, sure.<br />- Yeah. Good.
3808217 3810302 Hey, it's a nice place here.
3811137 3813931 Anyway, what I come to tell you is that,
3815306 3818561 that what happened to you is freak luck.
3818643 3820563 - Yeah, freak luck.<br />- Ain't it true?
3820646 3823148 Look at the other guys.<br />They're good fighters, right?
3823231 3825943 They're colorful. They got good records.
3826027 3828320 They fight their guts out for peanuts.
3828402 3832367 But you, you got a shot at the title!
3832449 3834911 Freak luck is a strange thing, you know?
3834994 3837496 - Sure is. Can I sit down?<br />- Yeah, sure.
3839123 3842210 - What the hell are those?<br />- Domestic turtles.
3842293 3844835 The one on the top is Cuff<br />and the other guy's Link.
3844920 3846130 The rest are marbles.
3846213 3848547 Yeah? They make good soup.
3849257 3850467 Anyway.
3850550 3853429 Look, I'm here to warn you.
3853512 3858016 You gotta be very careful<br />about this shot that you got at the title.
3858101 3860893 Because, like the Bible says,
3860978 3863146 you ain't gonna get a second chance.
3863231 3865358 Yeah. All right.
3865440 3867360 You thought of that, huh?
3867443 3870862 Well, what you need is a manager.
3871780 3873864 A manager. Listen to me.
3873949 3877704 I know, because I been in this racket<br />for 50 years.
3877786 3881039 - 50 years, huh?<br />- 50 years. I've seen it all.
3881123 3884460 - All of it. You know what I done?<br />- What?
3884543 3886545 I have done it all.
3886628 3890382 You should've seen me when I knocked<br />that guinea Russo out of the ring.
3890465 3892385 Out of the goddamn ring, I tell you.
3892467 3894512 September 14, 1923,
3894594 3898931 and it was the same night<br />that Firpo knocks Dempsey out of the ring.
3899016 3901393 So who gets the publicity? Figure that out.
3901476 3903396 - Dempsey.<br />- That's right. But why?
3903478 3907317 - 'Cause he was champ.<br />- No! Because he had a manager.
3907483 3909027 I had nothing.
3910402 3912905 I wanna show you something.<br />I want you to look at my face.
3912989 3916284 Look at this.<br />I got 21 stitches over this left eye.
3916367 3918827 I got 34 stitches over this eye.
3918911 3922331 You know I had my nose busted 17 times.
3922414 3927003 The last time<br />was in that fight with Sailor Mike.
3927085 3930005 I got that clipping here.<br />It was a good fight.
3930088 3932007 Wanna read that?
3932090 3934217 Well, it doesn't matter.
3934302 3937764 Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear.
3943268 3947190 You kind of remind me of the Rock,<br />you know that?
3947273 3949317 - You really think so?<br />- That's right.
3949400 3952777 You move like him,<br />and you got heart like he did.
3952862 3956449 Yeah, I got heart,<br />but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?
3960286 3962038 Anyway.
3962121 3965208 You know, when I begun<br />in this business, kid...
3967460 3971463 I wanna make a suggestion.<br />Don't drink that piss before a fight.
3971547 3973675 It's no good for you.
3974342 3976135 If you don't mind my saying.
3976219 3978471 Anyway, you know,<br />when I started in this racket,
3978554 3980764 pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.
3980847 3983266 For $10, you got to<br />tear somebody's throat out.
3983351 3985603 But I never had no management.
3986980 3989983 One time, this son of a bitch that I fought,
3990065 3991985 he put a nail right there.
3992068 3994402 - In his thumb.<br />- In the thumb of the glove.
3994487 3999617 He punched so many holes in my face,<br />I had spit shooting out of my cheeks.
4000159 4001994 Can you imagine that?
4002077 4005623 Anyway, when I tell you what I looked like<br />when I was in my prime.
4005706 4007458 I want you to look at something.
4007541 4010168 Look at that. That's the way I looked
4011085 4013213 before these guys got at me.
4013297 4017050 That's nice. You didn't take very good care<br />of the picture, though.
4017135 4020346 Well, I never had no management.
4020429 4022681 That's the trouble,<br />but now I got all this knowledge.
4022764 4025518 I got it up here.<br />Now I wanna give it to you.
4025601 4028271 I wanna give you this knowledge.<br />I wanna take care of you.
4028353 4031565 I wanna make sure that what happened<br />to me doesn't happen to you.
4031648 4033443 You know what I mean?
4033525 4035360 Mick, the fight's set.
4035445 4038030 Listen to me. I wanna be your manager.
4038114 4039532 You follow that?
4039614 4041826 Fight's set. I don't need no manager.
4041909 4044244 But you can't buy<br />what I'm gonna give you.
4044329 4046706 I got pain and I got experience.
4046789 4049333 I got pain and I got experience too.
4050043 4051460 Listen, kid.
4051668 4053210 Hey, Mick.
4053295 4055882 I needed your help<br />about 10 years ago, right?
4055965 4058967 Ten years ago. You never helped me none.<br />You didn't care.
4059052 4060887 If you wanted help...
4061512 4065556 I say, if you wanted help,<br />why didn't you just ask me, kid?
4065641 4068226 I asked, but you never heard nothing!
4069143 4070521 Well, I...
4073775 4075150 I know I...
4075233 4076902 I'm 76 years old.
4081614 4082824 And...
4118319 4120779 Took you long enough to get here.
4121488 4123698 Took 10 years to come to my house.
4123783 4125783 You don't like my house?
4126493 4128078 My house stink?
4129203 4131205 That's right, it stinks!
4131288 4133626 I didn't ask no favors from you!
4136712 4138546 Talk about your prime.
4139046 4140966 What about my prime, Mick?
4141216 4143176 At least you had a prime!
4143926 4146139 I ain't had no prime. I ain't had nothing.
4146220 4149180 Legs are going, everything is going.<br />Nobody's giving me nothing.
4149265 4151475 Guy comes up, offers me a fight. Big deal.
4151560 4154020 Wanna fight the fight?<br />Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.
4154104 4157692 I'm gonna go fight that big fight<br />and I'm gonna get that!
4158109 4159859 I'm gonna get that!
4161069 4163197 And you wanna be ringside and see?
4163279 4165323 Do you? You wanna help me out?
4165408 4168161 Do you wanna see me<br />get my face kicked in?
4168243 4170246 Legs ain't working, nothing's working.
4170328 4172787 Think I'll go and fight the champ.
4173247 4175042 Yeah, I'll fight him.
4177462 4179337 Get my face kicked in.
4180212 4182800 And you come around here.<br />You wanna move in with me?
4182884 4185094 Come on in. It's a nice house!
4185676 4188430 Real nice! Come on in! It stinks!
4189724 4191725 This whole place stinks.
4192185 4194060 You wanna help me out?
4194520 4198274 Well, help me out! Come on. Help me out.<br />I'm standing here!
4258001 4261045 <i>It's only about 28 degrees.</i><br /><i>We'll check that forecast.</i>
4261127 4264046 <i>I feel very mischievous, very weird, very...</i>
4265381 4267635 <i>I got vinyl seats in my car.</i>
4267719 4270805 <i>When I hit those seats this morning,</i><br /><i>I just went, "Whoo!"</i>
4270886 4275143 <i>I figure if I'm up, everybody</i><br /><i>in the Delaware Valley should be up.</i>
4275225 4276560 <i>You agree with me?</i>
4276644 4280479 <i>At three minutes past 4:00 in the morning,</i><br /><i>what else you gonna do?</i>
4281983 4283149 <i>Hello?</i>
4283234 4286779 <i>Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.</i><br /><i>This is Don Cabot, WYBG Philadelphia?</i>
4286863 4289113 <i>- How are you this morning?</i><br /><i>- What?</i>
4289198 4293077 <i>You have a lot of nerve</i><br /><i>calling me at this hour of the morning!</i>
4293161 4294453 <i>Good-bye!</i>
4307631 4310301 <i>Me and Mrs. Kramer are up,</i><br /><i>and it's a good morning.</i>
4310386 4313014 <i>I tell you, I need someone</i><br /><i>to snuggle with. 28 degrees.</i>
4313095 4315140 <i>It's cold out there. We deserve it.</i>
4315224 4317685 <i>We've been getting away with murder</i><br /><i>the last couple of weeks.</i>
4317769 4319854 <i>Our high today could be...</i>
4319935 4322814 <i>Tonight we're back down</i><br /><i>in the 20-degree range.</i>
4322899 4324399 <i>A little colder in the suburbs.</i>
4324484 4327694 <i>Tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,</i><br /><i>we may hit 40.</i>
4327779 4329697 <i>But it's 28. It's awfully chilly.</i>
4329779 4332533 <i>Make sure you have it bundled up</i><br /><i>before you bring it out.</i>
4474676 4475926 Come on.
4476886 4479470 It stinks in here, you know?
4479555 4481349 Yeah. I know.
4483184 4485395 Did you kill all these things?
4486020 4487939 No, across the street.
4489899 4492694 It's like an animal morgue.
4493194 4495029 It's a little cold in here, ain't it?
4495113 4496197 Yeah.
4500702 4502868 Who killed all these things?
4503371 4505037 Are you crazy, Paulie?
4505122 4507375 If you don't pay Gazzo,<br />you end up on a hook.
4507457 4509627 Gazzo's a good man. You know that.
4509711 4511502 Don't get excited. I know that.
4511587 4515506 That's why I wanted you to talk to him<br />about me and the collecting job.
4515591 4518094 And can get me out of<br />this stinking freezer.
4518176 4522180 Why don't you do yourself a favor?<br />Keep this job. You eat better.
4523555 4524640 Moo.
4525225 4527353 Does it ever snow in here?
4528104 4532317 You and my sister,<br />how you getting along together?
4533234 4534902 How do you think?
4535444 4538072 I'm not sure, Rock. What's the story?
4539073 4540448 About what?
4540698 4542368 What's happening?
4543202 4544912 You really like her?
4544996 4546622 Sure, I like her.
4548707 4551377 I don't see it. What's the attraction?
4552420 4555212 I don't know. Fills gaps, I guess.
4555921 4557425 What's "gaps"?
4557759 4561761 I don't know. She's got gaps.<br />I got gaps. Together we fill gaps.
4564265 4565890 You balling her?
4568060 4570770 You don't talk dirty about your sister.
4572604 4574774 Are you screwing my sister?
4577234 4580698 You see?<br />That's why I can't connect you with Gazzo.
4580782 4584118 Because you got a big mouth.<br />You just talk too much.
4585118 4588037 - It's cold in here. I'm going home.<br />- Cold in here?
4588122 4589707 It is cold in here!
4589791 4592210 It stinks in here, and you stink!
4620779 4622823 You're breaking the ribs.
4642176 4646220 If you do that to Apollo Creed,<br />they'll put us in jail for murder.
4648015 4650600 I'll see you tomorrow morning, okay?
4663323 4665573 - I turned the heat up.<br />- Thanks.
4665992 4669912 Your brother's a good man,<br />but he's awful pushy, you know?
4680212 4683259 - You want me to rub you down?<br />- No, I'm just sore, okay?
4683341 4685595 - I'm gonna just sit here.<br />- You sure?
4685676 4687095 Yeah, I'm sure.
4690765 4693645 Hey, come on. No fooling around, all right?
4693978 4695313 I'm tired.
4696229 4698147 Adrian, I'm serious now.
4698231 4700109 There's no fooling around during training.
4700193 4701944 I wanna stay strong.
4702278 4705113 - You're not kidding.<br />- No, I ain't kidding.
4708117 4710078 - You sure?<br />- Yeah, I'm sure.
4710161 4712872 Why don't you just make the meat, okay?
4714747 4716751 Okay, I'll make the meat.
4743359 4745279 - It's okay.<br />- I'm sorry.
4777979 4780939 Underneath! Underneath!<br />Knock him out! Come on!
4781024 4783109 Hold it. Hold it, Rock!
4783192 4787194 You're driving me crazy. You're so sloppy<br />because you're off balance.
4787279 4789198 Let's try this. Take this string.
4789282 4790867 Tie it to both ankles.
4790948 4794037 - Leave about two feet of slack.<br />- I never had good footwork.
4794118 4796706 Never mind footwork.<br />Now you're all balanced.
4796787 4799292 Marciano had the same problem
4799375 4801542 and this string cured it.
4802045 4806966 If you can move and hit without<br />breaking the string, you got balance!
4807050 4809344 You become a dangerous person.
4809426 4811386 - You follow me?<br />- Looking good, Rock.
4811470 4813514 - Thanks.<br />- Let's go. That's it.
4813595 4815515 - Underneath it.<br />- Hey, Rock.
4815600 4817685 - What?<br />- How about an autograph?
4817769 4819185 Get out of here!
4819270 4822064 Don't interrupt me<br />while I'm conducting business.
4822148 4824399 Move your little chicken asses out.
4824484 4828694 Hey, listen, kid.<br />You lay off that pet shop dame.
4829113 4831488 Women weaken legs.
4832742 4835036 Yeah, but I really like this girl, you know?
4835118 4837037 Then let her train you!
4839666 4841626 Okay, no more fooling around.
4841707 4843377 Okay. Now hit it.
4845046 4847296 Women weaken legs, huh?
4851886 4853429 - Yo, Rock.<br />- Yo, Rocky.
4864064 4865608 You look great.
4866734 4868569 - Really?<br />- Oh, yeah.
4868778 4871279 Terrific. I mean, you could be a heartbreak.
4871363 4874158 You'll walk down the street<br />breaking hearts the way you're looking.
4874242 4875326 Very sharp.
4875908 4877996 I got another surprise for you.
4878078 4879247 What?
4879872 4882417 Butkus! Hey, Butkus.
4882500 4884417 Come here, kid.
4884502 4886877 To keep you company when you run.
4891884 4894886 Come in and meet the family.<br />The owner never come back?
4894970 4896930 Gloria says he's yours if you want him.
4897015 4899725 Do I want him? What's he eat?
4899809 4901685 He eats little turtles.
4926377 4928087 What's that, Butkus?
4928171 4930131 Whose truck is this? Come on.
4932591 4935176 One call from me, you're a celebrity.
4937305 4938763 You got... Need exposure.
4938847 4941100 - Don't breathe on me.<br />- That's the big time.
4941184 4942810 Don't I know about these things?
4942894 4945063 You don't know nothing.<br />What do they want from me?
4945145 4946814 To watch you train.
4946898 4949609 What is the matter with you?<br />This is supposed to be private.
4949692 4952109 - I'm doing you a favor.<br />- You ain't doing me no favors!
4952194 4954113 You're embarrassing me<br />in front of everybody.
4954197 4956157 You'll make me look bad<br />in front of your sis...
4956238 4958533 See this cigar?<br />I'm gonna stick it in your ear.
4958618 4961746 Don't do these things to me.<br />You should've called me.
4961828 4964162 Leave a message. Don't do that.
4964832 4966957 My sister really likes you.
4968252 4970505 I'm gonna kill you one of these days!
4970587 4971837 Come on.
4971921 4973631 - Baby!<br />- Baby.
4974256 4977970 Here he is, the next heavyweight<br />champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!
4978054 4979970 Hello there. Rocky Balboa.
4980055 4981973 We wanna get a brief interview with you.
4982056 4983893 - What about me?<br />- What about you?
4983975 4986310 - I'm in charge of the meat.<br />- Fine. Stand behind it.
4986395 4988398 Settle yourself down. Relax.
4988479 4991359 What we're going to do<br />is ask you a few questions.
4991442 4993987 Just a few questions<br />about your unique training method.
4994069 4995863 Talk to the folks at home.
4995947 4997988 They really wanna know<br />how you got into this.
4998073 5000702 This isn't an everyday thing.<br />Jimmy, you guys ready?
5000783 5002912 Let's roll it. Rocky, turn around here.
5002996 5004872 Just don't take no cheap shots, you know?
5004956 5006872 No, I won't do that. Just relax.
5006957 5010420 Today we're here with<br />heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.
5010502 5014756 - The reason we're standing in this...<br />- The meat guy's sticking his face in.
5014841 5016884 Let's try it again, Rocky.
5017719 5020805 <i>Today we're here with</i><br /><i>heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.</i>
5020886 5023430 <i>The reason we're standing</i><br /><i>in this refrigerated box</i>
5023515 5026728 <i>is that Mr. Balboa</i><br /><i>has an unusual method of training.</i>
5026810 5030273 <i>In a moment, he'll demonstrate that</i><br /><i>for the viewing audience at home.</i>
5030354 5033943 <i>But first, Rocky,</i><br /><i>how did you come to train in an icebox?</i>
5034569 5037404 <i>Well, my friend, the guy over there,</i>
5037488 5040323 <i>he let me in one day,</i><br /><i>and I hit the beef here and liked it,</i>
5040408 5043786 <i>and since I've become a challenger,</i><br /><i>the owner don't mind that I come in.</i>
5043868 5047747 <i>Is this a common training method?</i><br /><i>Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i>
5047832 5049792 <i>No, I think I invented it.</i>
5049876 5052627 <i>- Would you give us a demonstration?</i><br />- Confirm the reservation
5052712 5056131 for my people at ringside,<br />and fly my barber to Philly.
5059594 5062639 How much is being channeled<br />into West Coast closed-circuit advertising?
5062720 5064974 - 300,000.<br />- Make it 450.
5065055 5067475 And send the mayor's wife<br />200 roses from me,
5067560 5070313 and make sure we get a picture of it<br />for all the newspapers.
5070395 5073483 Do you want to run the 15 radio spots<br />in the Midwest?
5073564 5076152 You can spend your money better<br />in Canadian publicity.
5076234 5078944 By the way, Apollo,<br />I've got friends in Toronto
5079029 5080988 who can get you a good tax break.
5081073 5083201 George, I like your friends.
5091167 5095587 Hey, Champ. You ought to come<br />look at this boy you're gonna fight on TV.
5096255 5099466 - Looks like he means business.<br />- Yeah, I mean business too.
5099550 5101676 Shirley, we got any more coffee out there?
5101761 5104389 Certainly, Mr. Creed.<br />I'll get you some right away.
5104470 5107684 After the fight,<br />I may retire and run for emperor.
5122198 5124533 <i>Diana Lewis in the meat house</i>
5124617 5127078 <i>with southpaw Rocky Balboa.</i>
5173582 5175542 And he called the reporters?
5175626 5178212 Yeah. Threw my training schedule off.
5178296 5180421 Don't be mad at him. He's trying to help.
5180506 5182300 Adrian, I ain't mad,
5182381 5185595 it's just that when reporters are<br />around, I get out of joint
5185676 5188970 'cause they take cheap shots,<br />and Paulie knows that.
5189265 5192393 And Paulie keeps asking me<br />for a job all the time
5192475 5195229 but he don't know nothing about fighting.
5195313 5197774 Are you gonna say anything to him?
5198564 5202028 What's to say?<br />I just don't know what he wants from me.
5204279 5206532 I don't want nothing from you.
5207283 5209577 I don't want nothing from you.
5210453 5214287 This ain't no charity case.<br />Get out of my house.
5214372 5216376 It's not just your house.
5217335 5219337 You're no friend no more.
5219712 5222796 - Get out of my house, I just says.<br />- Don't talk to him like that.
5222881 5225176 Both of you get out of my house!
5227176 5229220 It's cold outside, Paulie.
5239229 5241317 I don't want you messing her
5241399 5243987 and I don't raise you<br />to go with this scum bum!
5244069 5245822 Yeah? Come on! You wanna hit on me?
5245904 5249742 Come on! I'll break both your arms<br />so they don't work for you.
5252078 5253162 Stop it!
5253246 5256541 I'm not good enough to meet with Gazzo?<br />That's what I think of Gazzo!
5256622 5261170 Now you're a big shot fighter, you<br />don't even throw a crumb to your friend.
5261252 5263506 When I go and get your meat<br />every morning!
5263587 5266091 You forgot that?<br />And then I even give you my sister too!
5266175 5268801 - Only a pig would say that!<br />- I'm a pig?
5269554 5271555 A pig gets you the best?
5272345 5275560 You're such a loser!<br />I don't get married because of you!
5275935 5278060 You can't live by yourself!
5278479 5282149 I put you two together,<br />and don't you forget it!
5282233 5283609 You owe me!
5286112 5288238 - You owe me!<br />- What do I owe you?
5288323 5290742 You're supposed to be good to me!
5290823 5294368 What do I owe you, Paulie?
5294453 5296037 I treat you good!
5296122 5299542 I cook for you, I clean for you,<br />I pick up your dirty clothes!
5299625 5302877 I take care of you, Paulie!<br />I don't owe you nothing!
5303627 5306090 And you made me feel like a loser!
5307216 5308926 I'm not a loser!
5309010 5310845 - You're busted!<br />- What?
5310926 5312720 You're not a virgin!
5313139 5315430 You let a man take down your pants!
5315515 5316975 She's busted!
5320063 5322148 I can't haul meat no more!
5352595 5354389 You want a roommate?
5359350 5360685 Absolutely.
5362563 5364854 Okay, now when you walk into the ring
5364939 5367694 with the number one<br />heavyweight of the world
5367777 5369444 you'll be ready, won't you?
5369529 5372948 Why? Because I waited for 50 years
5373032 5374658 to make you ready.
5374742 5377161 You'll be able to spit nails, kid!
5377243 5379872 Like the guy says,<br />you're gonna eat lightning
5379956 5381832 and you're gonna crap thunder!
5381916 5384667 You're gonna become<br />a very dangerous person.
5384752 5386045 Yo, Mickey.
5386127 5388212 Hey, how are you? Oh, Rock.
5388296 5391384 I want you to meet our cut man here.<br />Al Salvani.
5391466 5393469 - Take a look at his eye.<br />- How you doing, Al?
5393551 5395970 - That's right.<br />- It ain't bad. Seen worse.
5396055 5398847 - You ain't so bad yourself.<br />- Cover up. Things will be okay.
5398930 5400143 You cover up.
5400225 5401978 Go and take a shower.
5402060 5404479 Okay, Mick. I'll see you tomorrow.
5405479 5408609 You covered that Whitmore fight?
5408693 5411444 - That's why he won.<br />- Listen. We got a winner here.
5411529 5415573 We got a chance. He goes to the body<br />like nobody you've ever seen.
5415658 5418493 You just stand by. We're gonna win.
5425501 5428002 Hey, Rock. It's okay I talk to you?
5428587 5431341 Okay you talk to me? Sure.
5432131 5435011 I figured some angle<br />to make some money off your name.
5435094 5437720 My name? How's that?
5437889 5440515 Advertising. I know about that stuff.
5442350 5444854 What do you know about advertising?
5448149 5451069 Hey, you can make money off my name,<br />make it, okay?
5451152 5453154 I'm gonna take a shower.
5454113 5456658 - Wanna help me off with these?<br />- Sure.
5551961 5553837 You're gonna kill him!
5724716 5728220 Rocky. What brings you here tonight?
5729805 5731765 Mr. Jergens, the poster's wrong.
5732305 5733975 What do you mean?
5734143 5736979 I'm wearing white pants with a red stripe.
5740817 5743234 It doesn't really matter, does it?
5743319 5746154 I'm sure you're gonna give us<br />a great show.
5747154 5749242 Try to get some rest, kid.
5750076 5751452 Good night.
5842792 5844337 I can't do it.
5847421 5848506 What?
5849634 5851260 I can't beat him.
5852845 5854095 Apollo?
5854805 5855974 Yeah.
5857390 5860310 I been out there, walking around, thinking.
5862229 5865483 Who am I kidding?<br />I ain't even in the guy's league.
5870863 5872698 What are we gonna do?
5884292 5885712 I don't know.
5892091 5893845 You worked so hard.
5895720 5898930 Yeah, it don't matter,<br />'cause I was nobody before.
5901269 5902854 Don't say that.
5903563 5905854 Oh, come on, Adrian. It's true.
5905939 5907442 I was nobody.
5909359 5912029 But that don't matter either, you know?
5913072 5914988 'Cause I was thinking,
5916242 5919162 it really don't matter if I lose this fight.
5921247 5924832 It really don't matter<br />if this guy opens my head either.
5926127 5928921 'Cause all I wanna do is go the distance.
5933841 5936720 Nobody's ever gone the distance<br />with Creed,
5937555 5939805 and if I can go that distance,
5941225 5944228 and that bell rings, and I'm still standing,
5949524 5952862 I'm gonna know<br />for the first time in my life, see,
5954738 5958242 that I weren't just another bum<br />from the neighborhood.
6025725 6027520 Time, kid. Let's go.
6030564 6032483 I'll wait for you here.
6034819 6037613 How about I wait here and you fight, huh?
6038488 6041576 You're looking very great today,<br />you know that?
6043578 6046662 I gotta go now,<br />but don't you leave town, huh?
6048082 6050460 Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it.
6051210 6052545 Good luck.
6053337 6056631 Adrian, you don't think<br />this robe is too baggy, huh?
6056841 6058176 Good luck.
6058259 6059886 Don't leave town.

6124658 6127036 <i>Which makes me wonder, can he stand it?</i>
6127118 6129747 <i>You know, the stamina and the skill</i><br /><i>to last three rounds.</i>
6129831 6131791 <i>Because Las Vegas odds say no.</i>
6131872 6134711 <i>Rocky Balboa, climbing into the ring now.</i>
6135420 6136921 <i>"The Italian Stallion."</i>
6137005 6140925 <i>Some meat sign on the back of his robe.</i><br /><i>You seen what that was?</i>
6141009 6143011 <i>Shamrock Meat...</i>
6143094 6146264 <i>There's a lot of noise</i><br /><i>coming from the background.</i>
6146764 6149434 <i>- They have spotlights.</i><br /><i>- Am I seeing right back there?</i>
6149515 6152979 <i>Is that the world heavyweight champion,</i><br /><i>Apollo Creed?</i>
6153060 6157108 <i>He's riding in a boat.</i><br /><i>Is he supposed to be George Washington?</i>
6157189 6160444 <i>Obviously so.</i><br /><i>He's got the hat on, the whole thing.</i>
6161944 6164532 <i>The world champion, Apollo Creed</i>
6164613 6167452 <i>is doing an imitation</i><br /><i>of George Washington.</i>
6168411 6170121 <i>He's throwing money.</i>
6170203 6173625 <i>Remember when we were growing up,</i><br /><i>we were taught about George Washington</i>
6173707 6175126 <i>throwing a dollar.</i>
6175207 6177962 <i>If you threw a dollar in those days,</i><br /><i>it went a lot farther.</i>
6178046 6180756 <i>Now he's taking his...</i><br /><i>Blonde wig came off.</i>
6180840 6182466 <i>The hat came off.</i>
6183801 6185219 I want you!
6186470 6188970 <i>The crowd is loving every minute of it.</i>
6189055 6192100 <i>- Here is the world heavyweight champion.</i><br /><i>- Apollo Creed.</i>
6192185 6193603 <i>For you around the world</i>
6193685 6196604 <i>he was dressed as George Washington,</i><br /><i>the father of our country.</i>
6196689 6198064 I want you!
6200818 6204322 <i>I don't believe what I'm seeing.</i><br /><i>Uncle Sam himself!</i>
6204404 6205948 I want you!
6206032 6208868 I want all of you!
6209452 6211328 He looks like a big flag.
6211412 6213456 I want you!
6214622 6216917 - Is he talking to me?<br />- He's talking to you.
6217001 6219170 - Is he talking to me?<br />- Let him talk.
6219252 6221046 I want the Stallion!
6221712 6224006 <i>He says, "I want the Stallion."</i>
6225510 6228511 <i>For you in foreign countries,</i><br /><i>during World War I,</i>
6228595 6231515 <i>the picture of Uncle Sam</i><br /><i>with his finger pointed like that</i>
6231599 6234018 <i>was a recruiting poster</i><br /><i>for our fellows in the service,</i>
6234100 6236310 <i>the army and the navy. "I want you."</i>
6236395 6238479 <i>That's what he's doing a take on.</i>
6238564 6241818 <i>He's yelling, "Creed in three."</i>
6241899 6244028 What do you think that outfit cost?
6254412 6256582 <i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>
6257292 6261170 <i>Good evening. A very Happy New Year.</i>
6261252 6263256 <i>Welcome to Philadelphia.</i>
6263337 6266091 <i>Everybody who's anybody is here tonight.</i>
6268301 6271720 <i>Time does not permit me to introduce</i>

6275310 6279729 <i>show business and the sporting world</i><br /><i>who are with us tonight</i>
6280064 6282233 <i>but I would like to present</i>
6282317 6285359 <i>one of the immortals of pugilism,</i>
6285444 6289073 <i>a champion in and out of the ring,</i>
6289157 6291908 <i>Philadelphia's own "Smokin' Joe,"</i>
6291993 6294828 <i>the beloved Mr. Joe Frazier!</i>
6305590 6306881 How you doing?
6306966 6308384 Don't hurt him, okay?
6308466 6310094 I'll try not to.
6310176 6312555 <i>What a credit he's been</i><br /><i>in his career as a fighter.</i>
6312639 6314765 <i>Now he's coming over</i><br /><i>to talk to the champ.</i>
6314849 6317268 - Hey, Joe.<br />- You been ducking me a long time.
6317350 6319020 No, Joe. You're next.
6319103 6321314 - You're next.<br />- You understand?
6321854 6323439 They must be friends.
6331823 6333658 Joe Frazier!
6333743 6335953 <i>- Fight fans, get settled down.</i><br />- Go home!
6336037 6339162 - Don't stay in the arena!<br /><i>- It won't be long now.</i>
6340625 6344087 <i>Now for the main event.</i>
6347796 6349425 <i>On my left</i>
6349509 6352636 <i>the challenger, in white trunks,</i>
6352720 6355845 <i>weighing 190 pounds.</i>
6355930 6358434 <i>Philadelphia's favorite son,</i>
6358518 6361354 <i>The Italian Stallion,</i>
6361435 6363523 <i>Rocky Balboa.</i>
6370488 6372782 <i>And on my right</i>
6372863 6375326 <i>wearing red, white and blue,</i>
6375408 6378496 <i>weighing 210 pounds,</i>
6378578 6382000 <i>undefeated in 46 fights,</i>
6382332 6384836 <i>The Master of Disaster,</i>
6385295 6389006 <i>the undisputed heavyweight champion</i><br /><i>of the world,</i>
6389090 6390881 <i>Apollo Creed!</i>
6392676 6395220 I want you! You!
6397930 6400768 You, chump. I want you!
6400850 6403854 You've both fought in Philadelphia before.<br />You know the rules.
6403938 6407064 No low blows,<br />watch your heads, no butting.
6407149 6408899 Shake hands and come out fighting.
6408984 6410653 Put your hands up there, chump.
6410737 6412863 - Come out fighting.<br />- Come on!
6414863 6419746 <i>Rocky's just going over and being calm,</i><br /><i>it looks like from here.</i>
6420872 6422787 <i>There goes the big hat.</i>
6426252 6429837 <i>I've never seen a fighter</i><br /><i>that concerned about his hair.</i>
6437889 6440224 <i>There's the bell for round one.</i>
6441684 6445813 <i>The fighters come in the center of the ring,</i><br /><i>looking at each other.</i>
6445895 6449359 <i>Creed, the champion,</i><br /><i>zipping in those left-handed jabs.</i>
6449442 6451359 <i>Right there. Bang.</i>
6452987 6456198 <i>The champ stinging the slower challenger</i><br /><i>with jabs at will.</i>
6456282 6460243 <i>In fact, it looks like Rocky</i><br /><i>is blocking the blows with his face.</i>
6460328 6464747 <i>The champion doesn't look the best</i><br /><i>he's ever been, but he's moving now.</i>
6464832 6468752 <i>The champion's smiling now.</i><br /><i>He's toying with him.</i>
6469587 6472506 <i>Trying to give the fans</i><br /><i>their money's worth.</i>
6474175 6477636 <i>He's very clearly outclassed</i><br /><i>the challenger right now.</i>
6479805 6483768 <i>He's trying to make his man miss like that.</i>
6485269 6487895 <i>The champ is just taunting him.</i>
6490774 6492609 <i>Creed dancing around.</i>
6494028 6495863 <i>I don't believe this!</i>
6495947 6498323 <i>The champ is down!</i>
6504453 6505662 <i>Creed is down!</i>
6505747 6507707 <i>What a surprise this is!</i>
6508876 6512212 <i>This is the first time the champion</i><br /><i>has ever been knocked down.</i>
6512296 6514506 <i>The referee is giving him the count.</i>
6514590 6517426 Six, seven, eight.
6517510 6520386 <i>He appears to be all right.</i><br /><i>Glassy-eyed but okay.</i>
6520761 6523972 Go to the ribs! Go to work, Rock!
6524055 6525560 Come on!
6526853 6530064 <i>Rocky coming back out,</i><br /><i>and he's like a bull in a china closet.</i>
6530148 6533067 <i>He really wants it. Apollo, left to the head.</i>
6533192 6536863 <i>The champion's coming off the floor</i>
6536944 6539032 <i>and he's trying to put him away.</i>
6539113 6540658 <i>A left, a right.</i>
6540742 6544203 <i>Combinations into the face!</i><br /><i>That's the Apollo we know.</i>
6548291 6551667 <i>Now the champ is taunting Rocky</i><br /><i>to come and get some more.</i>
6551752 6553377 <i>A left. Another.</i>
6553880 6555381 <i>Another left.</i>
6556841 6558635 <i>Rocky's coming back!</i>
6560094 6563014 <i>Rocky's got him on the ropes!</i>
6563805 6565305 Let's break it.
6566809 6568353 You're holding.
6568435 6570229 You're posing as a boxer.
6570313 6573399 <i>There's no way we expected</i><br /><i>this kind of hitting.</i>
6576484 6578569 Do your best. Do your best.
6580948 6584702 <i>Apollo unloading a left.</i><br /><i>He's got him up against the ropes.</i>
6592417 6596546 <i>They're leading him to his corner.</i><br /><i>Rocky can't find his way.</i>
6597256 6598631 I called it!
6598716 6601260 - Your nose is broke.<br />- How's it look?
6601344 6602845 It's an improvement.
6602929 6606180 Quit shucking and jiving! Stick and move!
6606265 6609769 Go for the ribs.<br />Don't let that bastard breathe.
6609850 6611270 The guy's quick.
6611354 6615149 He doesn't know it's a damn show.<br />He thinks it's a damn fight.
6615233 6617944 Finish this bum, and let's go home.
6618944 6621322 Stay to the body. You're doing great!
6621404 6624617 <i>Round two.</i><br /><i>Creed predicted he'd win in it in three.</i>
6624701 6628287 <i>Creed got knocked down in the first.</i><br /><i>He came back strong.</i>
6628621 6630287 <i>He's working now.</i>
6630707 6633457 <i>A sharp left. Again, a hard right.</i>
6633542 6636045 <i>Now coming in.</i><br /><i>He's knocked him into the corner again.</i>
6636127 6638631 <i>The champion's got him</i><br /><i>backed into the corner.</i>
6638715 6642635 <i>Pummeling him left and right,</i><br /><i>his head bouncing against the ropes.</i>
6643511 6646595 <i>Balboa's taking</i><br /><i>a tremendous beating here.</i>
6646680 6650268 <i>Battering him like a punching bag.</i><br /><i>What's keeping him up?</i>
6652603 6654063 Can't you fight?
6654145 6657399 Stop clowning around<br />and give the people something!
6658067 6660403 - Come on!<br /><i>- He says he wants more!</i>
6660484 6663279 <i>He wants more. You folks</i><br /><i>watching television around the world</i>
6663363 6665408 <i>you're watching a battle.</i>
6670162 6673497 <i>Balboa trying to fight back.</i><br /><i>Oh, he tagged the champ!</i>
6673582 6677086 <i>The champion is trying to get out of there,</i><br /><i>but he can't do it.</i>
6677170 6681046 <i>He is being barraged with lefts and rights</i><br /><i>to the head and body.</i>
6681131 6684426 <i>Balboa is tagging the champion</i><br /><i>right on the kisser!</i>
6685426 6688680 <i>The referee steps in.</i><br /><i>They're ready to keep going.</i>
6689220 6691059 Back to your corners!
6691684 6693603 Come on, Creed!
6694354 6696604 <i>This is gonna be a tough one.</i>
6751243 6753578 <i>- Back with a left!</i><br /><i>- He got tagged!</i>
6755206 6757750 <i>The referee's wiping off the gloves.</i>
6762962 6765300 <i>Hard left and right combination!</i>
6765381 6768301 <i>- What is keeping him up, Bill?</i><br /><i>- I don't know.</i>
6770261 6773555 <i>He can't even get his gloves up</i><br /><i>to protect himself.</i>
6780979 6783067 Down! Stay down!
6783149 6785444 <i>Apollo has his arms in the air!</i>
6796497 6797622 Five.
6798916 6800001 Six.
6800585 6801792 Seven.
6801877 6803046 Eight.
6803462 6804546 Nine.
6811429 6812680 Come on!
6813970 6815975 <i>Apollo can't believe it.</i>
6832742 6835953 <i>The champion got a left to his right ribs.</i>
6836328 6838537 <i>This has been a tremendous...</i>
6844337 6845505 Okay, champ?
6845587 6846881 Yeah, I'm okay.
6846965 6849591 I may have broke my ribs.
6849676 6852136 I can't see nothing. Gotta open my eye.
6852220 6854136 - Cut me.<br />- Don't wanna do it.
6854220 6856724 - Go ahead. Cut me.<br />- Okay.
6856805 6858350 Try it. Cut it.
6858810 6860685 Creed! Creed!
6862645 6863854 Oh, God.
6863939 6866734 You're bleeding inside.<br />I'm gonna stop the fight.
6866818 6870113 You ain't stopping nothing, man.
6870319 6872782 You stop this fight, I'll kill you!
6874158 6876327 - I'm going.<br />- If you wanna go.
6877537 6879872 You gotta give it all!
6879997 6881916 You gotta get him!
6887380 6889340 <i>The 15th and final round.</i>
6889421 6892426 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
6898265 6900893 <i>They look like they've been in a war.</i>
6908524 6911904 <i>A hard right.</i><br /><i>The champion really tagged him.</i>
6911988 6915948 <i>Apollo clearly protecting</i><br /><i>his right side, his ribs.</i>
6919368 6921162 <i>Body punches!</i>
6921247 6924667 <i>Hard lefts and rights. Look at the blood</i><br /><i>coming out of his mouth!</i>
6924751 6926877 <i>He's spitting up blood now.</i>
6930340 6932841 <i>A tremendous right hand by Rocky.</i>
6932925 6934301 Go for it, Rock!
6934385 6937430 <i>- Listen to this crowd!</i><br /><i>- Right to the ribs.</i>
6937511 6939805 <i>Another to the ribs. That left hand again.</i>
6939890 6943144 <i>Right to the jaw!</i><br /><i>He's got him up against the ropes!</i>
6943225 6945313 <i>Apollo the champ...</i>
6948774 6951527 Ain't gonna be no rematch.
6952153 6953694 Don't want one.
6964207 6967167 Rocky, you went the distance, 15 rounds.<br />How do you feel?
6967251 6969752 - All right.<br />- What were you thinking about...
6969837 6972465 - Adrian!<br />...coming out for the 15th round?
6972546 6973800 Adrian!
