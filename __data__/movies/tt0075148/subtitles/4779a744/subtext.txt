1458041 1460210 - The girl's dried up.<br />- Who?
1460252 1463880 My sister. If she don't start living,<br />her body's gonna dry up.
1463922 1466341 Tomorrow's Thanksgiving,<br />you know that?
1466383 1469261 - Come over and talk to her.<br />- Sure. Beer.
1469719 1471638 Tomorrow you come<br />for some bird, right?
1471721 1473974 Absolutely. You got it.
1474641 1477435 I gotta go. If I'm ten minutes late,<br />she calls the hospital.

1580789 1582999 Marie, does your brother know<br />you're hanging out so late?
1583041 1585210 - Get lost, creep.<br />- Screw you, yo-yo!
1585293 1587337 These guys teach you<br />to talk like that?
1587420 1590298 - Stuff it!<br />- Don't you never say that to me.
1591007 1593510 You stink up the neighborhood!
1595136 1596972 You know, you can...
1597055 1601351 When I was your age, only one girl in<br />the whole neighborhood talked like that.
1601393 1603311 That was it. Just one.
1603478 1606564 What are you doing? It'll make<br />your teeth yellow. Don't do that.
1606648 1607983 I like yellow teeth!
1608024 1610402 - It'll make your breath like garbage.<br />- Maybe I like garbage.
1610485 1612320 Nobody likes garbage.
1612696 1615198 Anyway, this girl with the dirty<br />mouth wasn't bad looking,
1615282 1617784 but none of the guys<br />ever took her serious.
1617867 1619703 They never took her out<br />for any serious date.
1619786 1621371 - Why?<br />- 'Cause that's the way guys are.
1621413 1623498 They laugh when you talk dirty.<br />They think you're cute.
1623540 1626209 After a while, you get a reputation.<br />You get no respect.
1626293 1628670 You understand? You get no respect.
1628712 1631423 I gotta use a bad word, whore.
1631506 1633425 You understand? Whore.
1633508 1637512 See? You use dirty words, and maybe<br />you end up becoming a whore.
1637887 1639472 Come on, Rocky.<br />I'm 12.
1639556 1641933 That don't matter.
1642017 1645103 You don't really have to be one.<br />Just act like one and that's it.
1645186 1648898 Boom! Bing! You get a bad rep.<br />You understand?
1649232 1652485 Twenty years from now,<br />people are gonna say,
1652569 1654904 "Do you remember Marie?"<br />"No. Who was she?"
1654988 1657574 "She was the little whore who hung<br />down at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."
1657657 1659951 "Oh, yeah. Now I remember her."
1660035 1663580 You see, they don't remember you.<br />They remember the rep.
1663621 1665206 You understand?
1666166 1669461 You got a boyfriend?<br />No, you ain't got a boyfriend.
1669878 1672589 You know why? Why don't you<br />think you have a boyfriend?
1672672 1675467 'Cause you're hanging out with them<br />coconuts on the corner.
1675550 1677385 You hang around coconuts,<br />you get nowhere.
1677427 1679179 They're lemons. Lemons.
1679262 1682307 You hang out with nice people,<br />you get nice friends. You understand?
1682390 1684893 You hang out with smart people,<br />you get smart friends.
1684934 1687479 You hang out with yo-yo people,<br />you get yo-yo friends.
1687562 1689981 You see, it's simple mathematics.
1690815 1692317 - I hope you ain't...<br />- I won't.
1692400 1693485 What was I gonna say?
1693568 1696613 You hope I don't keep acting like a<br />whore or I'll turn into one, right?
1696696 1697781 Yeah, something like that.
1697864 1698990 Good night, Rocky.
1699074 1701368 - Good night. Take care.<br />- Hey, Rocky.
1701451 1704120 - Yo.<br />- Screw you, creep-o!
1712003 1714798 Yeah, who are you to<br />give advice, creep-o?
1714881 1716299 Who are you?
1735151 1738363 - Are the doctor's reports confirmed?<br />JERGENS: Definitely.
1738655 1740490 Says here Mac Lee<br />Green has suffered
1740573 1744119 "a severely cracked third<br />metacarpal in his left hand."
1744577 1745954 Damn!
1746079 1750125 We can cancel the fight indefinitely<br />if you're set on fighting Green.
1750166 1752210 Hey, it ain't just Green.
1752502 1754838 What about all the time<br />Apollo has invested?
1754921 1756589 We can find a solution.
1756673 1757757 Solution nothing.
1757841 1760552 Find me another ranked contender<br />in a flash, Jergens.
1760635 1762637 MAN:<br />Don't play games with my client.
1762679 1765265 Apollo's already done a million<br />dollars' worth of publicity,
1765348 1768268 has made contractual obligations<br />with 20 different organizations.
1768351 1770061 He's not going to be embarrassed!
1770145 1772522 I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.
1772605 1774566 Ernie's fighting in<br />France that same week.
1774649 1776818 Then get me Buddy Shaw.<br />He's ranked fifth.
1776860 1779696 Went to California and<br />gained 50 pounds.
1780321 1782198 JERGENS: I called<br />every worthwhile contender.
1782240 1786202 They all say five weeks isn't<br />enough time to get into shape.
1786286 1788830 Shape nothing, man.<br />They're afraid.
1788913 1790915 They know everybody<br />is gonna see this fight.
1790999 1792834 None of them's got<br />a prayer of whipping me.
1792876 1796921 They're making excuses so they don't<br />have to be the chump who gets whipped.
1797005 1799632 All I can say is I'm<br />a good promoter.
1800133 1803303 I've promoted fights<br />in every goddamn country in the world
1803386 1805555 and I've broken my ass over this one.
1805638 1807891 I don't know what else to do!
1813480 1814606 I do.
1816983 1820904 Without a ranked contender,<br />what this fight needs is a novelty.
1821362 1823823 This is the land of<br />opportunity, right?
1823907 1826326 So, Apollo Creed,<br />on January 1st,
1826409 1829496 gives a local underdog fighter<br />an opportunity.
1830205 1834542 A snow-white underdog, and I'm gonna<br />put his face on this poster with me.
1834584 1836503 And I'll tell you why.
1836586 1838588 Because I'm sentimental.
1838922 1841633 A lot of other people in this country<br />are just as sentimental
1841716 1844552 and there's nothing they'd like<br />better than to see Apollo Creed
1844594 1847764 give a local Philadelphia boy a shot<br />at the greatest title in the world
1847805 1850141 on this country's biggest birthday.
1850225 1852352 Now that's the way I see it
1852685 1854938 and that's the way it's gonna be.
1854979 1856689 Apollo, I like it.
1857148 1858942 It's very American.
1859609 1862612 No, Jergens. It's very smart.

1925300 1928636 Relax, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood.<br />It's his prostate.
1928678 1931806 He's always in a bad mood.<br />You ought to count your blessings.

1992575 1994744 Joe Zack's a good prospect.
1995953 1998790 Exactly what are you<br />looking for, Apollo?
1999916 2002126 This is what I'm looking for.
2002293 2004420 The Italian Stallion.

2022772 2024524 I don't want you messing around<br />with southpaws.

2281364 2284617 What do I say to a door?<br />We better forget this.
2285034 2286118 You're doing fine.
2286202 2288537 I ain't doing fine.<br />I look like an idiot.
2288579 2290623 Keep doing what you're doing. Funny.
2290706 2292875 I know all about these things.
2292959 2294710 I feel like a jerk.
2300716 2303177 Yo, Adrian, it's Rocky again.
2303219 2307848 Listen, I know you ain't too happy<br />at this moment.
2308391 2310059 But could you do me a favor?
2310101 2313062 I ain't got nobody<br />to spend Thanksgiving with.
2313270 2316565 So, how about maybe you and I
2316649 2318484 go out together,<br />get something to eat.
2318567 2321112 Maybe laugh a little bit.<br />Who knows, you know?
2321195 2322947 Would you like to...
2324740 2327576 Would you like to, maybe,<br />you and me go out together?
2327660 2330287 What do you think?<br />Would you like to?
2335251 2337503 We're gonna have a good time.
2337878 2340047 We'll have a real good time.
2344593 2346387 Thanks for the bird.
2350016 2352935 I'm gonna turn the TV off.<br />I got a headache.
2365281 2367700 - What's your sister like to do?<br />- Ice-skate.
2367783 2369785 Adrian, come on.<br />You're letting the heat out.
2369827 2372163 Who pays the bills around here?
2377752 2380880 Listen, I don't want no<br />turkey anyway, you know?
2382465 2384467 But it was Thanksgiving.
2385301 2386427 What?
2386469 2388471 - It was Thanksgiving.<br />- Yeah, to you.
2388512 2390848 But to me it's Thursday, right?
2415206 2417875 - It looks kind of quiet.<br />- I think it's closed.
2417958 2421087 No, I think we're just early<br />or something like that.
2422505 2424340 - We're closed.<br />- What?
2424673 2427635 - I said we're closed.<br />- Yeah. Hey, listen.
2427676 2431055 I'm gonna smooth this guy out.<br />Wait here. I'll be right back.
2431263 2433057 - We could go someplace else.<br />- No, it's okay.
2433140 2437103 Are you closed to the general public,<br />or are you just closed to everybody?
2437186 2441357 It's after 6:00. It's Thanksgiving.<br />That's why there's nobody here.
2441690 2443734 Besides, you ain't<br />supposed to be in here.
2443818 2446320 So do me a favor<br />and not stay here.
2446362 2449949 - Could you do me a favor?<br />- Come on. We're not operating.
2450199 2453035 Look. This girl here<br />ain't feeling well.
2453119 2455663 Doctors say she should go out<br />and exercise.
2455704 2457873 Ice-skating's probably<br />the best thing.
2457957 2459208 So what do you want from me?
2459291 2461168 Well, hey,<br />I want you to do me a favor.
2461210 2462837 You can see she ain't<br />feeling too good.
2462878 2465923 If you can let her on the ice<br />for a few minutes, I'd appreciate it.
2466006 2467800 Ten minutes, ten bucks.
2467883 2470052 Ten bucks?<br />How about eight bucks?
2470136 2472263 Come on. It's Thanksgiving.
2472513 2474390 All right.<br />Nine bucks, you got a deal.
2474473 2477226 You have the ice to yourself.<br />Ten bucks.
2479353 2481105 Give her the blades.
2481897 2483190 Aren't you skating?
2483232 2485234 No,<br />I ain't skated since I was 15.
2485317 2487611 That's when I started fighting.
2487903 2490573 Skating's kind of bad for<br />the ankles, you know?
2491532 2494285 You're a pretty good<br />skater, aren't you?
2495077 2497580 Like I was saying<br />before on the way over here,
2497663 2500833 fighting used to be tops with me,<br />but no more.
2500916 2503419 All I wanted to do out of fighting<br />was prove I was no bum,
2503502 2505921 that I had the stuff<br />to make a good pro.
2505963 2509008 - You never got the chance?<br />- I ain't crying about it.
2509091 2511343 I still fight. I do it like a hobby.
2511427 2513596 The trouble is I'm a southpaw.
2513637 2516599 - What's a southpaw?<br />- A southpaw means you're left-handed.
2516682 2519059 A southpaw throws<br />your timing off.
2519101 2521437 It throws other guys' timing off,<br />makes them look awkward.
2521520 2523105 Nobody wants to look awkward.
2523147 2526358 - You know where "southpaw" came from?<br />MAN: Nine minutes!
2526442 2529486 A long time ago, there was this guy,<br />maybe a couple hundred years ago,
2529570 2533032 he was fighting in the...<br />I think it was around Philadelphia.
2533115 2537077 His arm... He was left-handed.<br />His arm was facing towards New Jersey.
2537119 2540998 And that's south. So naturally<br />they called him "south paw." You see?
2541081 2544376 Southpaw, South Jersey,<br />South Camden.
2544835 2546670 Southpaw.<br />You know what I mean?
2548130 2550299 Things probably worked out for<br />the best, don't you think?
2550382 2553052 Never got a chance<br />because you're left-handed, huh?
2553135 2555221 That's absolutely true,<br />you know?
2555304 2556555 Watch out.
2557056 2558474 (GROANING)
2558557 2561602 Ah! Ah!<br />I just dislocated my finger.
2561936 2563479 Ah! Look at that.
2564230 2566023 Wait. It ain't your fault. Look.
2566106 2568484 See? I had it... It's an old wound.
2568567 2570819 You see that? Look. See?
2570861 2572321 Nothing. It bends like that.
2572404 2575366 I originally done it... Push the button.<br />Bong. It works.
2575449 2578327 - It ain't your fault. Look.<br />MAN: Seven minutes!
2579078 2582081 I originally done it...<br />I carry pictures of all my fights.
2582164 2584917 I originally done it<br />in the Baby Crenshaw fight.
2585000 2588045 ROCKY: Baby's about the size of an<br />airplane. I broke both hands on his face.
2588128 2591507 I lost that fight, but that's a<br />nice picture, don't you think?
2591548 2592925 Real nice.
2594385 2596762 Come on. You having a good time?
2597471 2599390 You can see I ain't too graceful.
2599473 2603852 I don't move well, but I can really swat.<br />I can really hit hard.
2603936 2607606 But I'm a southpaw, and nobody<br />wants to fight no southpaw.
2612820 2615572 You know how I got<br />started in fighting?
2615656 2616657 No.
2617533 2619451 Am I talking too loud?
2619743 2621328 MAN:<br />Three minutes!
2621370 2625958 My father, he's a...<br />My old man, he was never too smart.
2626041 2628127 He says to me, "You weren't<br />born with much of a brain,
2628210 2630713 "so you better start<br />using your body."
2630796 2632715 So I become a fighter.
2633382 2635134 You know what I mean?
2635217 2637052 Why you laughing?
2638387 2641307 My mother, she said<br />the opposite thing.
2641390 2643642 What did she say the opposite?
2644268 2646562 She said, "You weren't<br />born with much of a body,
2646645 2648397 "so you better develop your brain."
2648439 2651233 - Did she say that?<br />- Yo, time!
2652526 2655404 - Can I ask you a question?<br />- Absolutely.
2656655 2660075 - Why do you wanna fight?<br />- 'Cause I can't sing or dance.
2660117 2661118 Hey, yo.
2661744 2663454 ROCKY:<br />Don't fall!
2664705 2667124 That was terrific.<br />I'm pretty good at this.
2667207 2668459 You like the way I skate?
2668542 2671587 Last fight I had, I had with<br />this guy named Spider Rico.
2671670 2674381 He busted my head up there.<br />You see that scar?
2674465 2677468 I'll tell you,<br />things get pretty rough in the ring.
2686935 2689897 You know,<br />some people are very shy by nature.
2690814 2692191 I suppose.
2693067 2694151 (CLEARS THROAT)
2695110 2697988 I say you're very shy<br />by nature, you know?
2699239 2700616 I suppose.
2703285 2705037 The bum from the dark.
2705120 2706789 Get a job, you bum!
2707623 2710501 Some people think<br />that being shy is a disease,
2710584 2712544 but it don't bother me none.
2712628 2714546 Don't bother me either.
2715881 2718008 So Why'd I bother bringing it up?
2718092 2720260 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.
2721512 2723555 I think we make<br />a sharp couple of coconuts.
2723639 2726475 I'm dumb and you're shy.<br />What do you think?
2728727 2732314 I don't understand<br />why anybody would wanna be a fighter.
2732648 2737945 You gotta be a moron to wanna<br />be a fighter, you know what I mean?
2738487 2741990 It's a racket where you're<br />almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
2742032 2745494 - I don't think you're a bum.<br />- I'm at least half a bum.
2745702 2747871 But I'll tell you something.
2748747 2751333 Worst thing about fighting<br />is the morning after.
2751375 2752793 - You know?<br />- Morning after.
2752835 2754753 Yeah, the morning after a fight,
2754837 2757381 you're like a large wound,<br />you know what I mean?
2757464 2759508 Sometimes I got pains all over me.
2759591 2763303 I feel like calling a taxi to take me<br />from the bed into the bathroom.
2763345 2765264 Your hair hurts,<br />your eyes hurt.
2765347 2768225 Your face is busted up.<br />Your hands are swollen.
2768308 2771395 Look at this face. Sixty-four fights.<br />Look at that nose.
2771478 2774231 You see that nose?<br />That nose ain't never been broken.
2774314 2776650 I had guys busting on it.
2776692 2779778 I had guys chewing on it,<br />twisting and punching it.
2779862 2781447 I mean, whack, boom.
2781530 2784032 These guys are hitting my nose<br />all the time.
2784116 2786076 Never broke it.<br />I'm very proud of that.
2786160 2787744 That's rare.
2787828 2790873 - Why do you do it if it hurts?<br />- Why you think?
2792291 2794918 'Cause you can't<br />sing and dance?
2795210 2797713 Yeah, something like that.
2797796 2799923 Hey, you wanna come inside?
2802259 2803510 No, I gotta go.
2803552 2805554 Hey, come on.<br />I got some animals.
2805637 2808056 I got these very rare<br />animals inside.
2808098 2809725 Come on in.
2809766 2811226 No, I gotta go.
2811310 2814146 I gotta go, too,<br />to the bathroom. Come on.
2814730 2815898 Come on.
2815939 2817733 No, I gotta go.
2817774 2821445 Look at this face.<br />Is that a face you could trust or what?
2821737 2825908 Is it? They ought to stick this face<br />on a stamp. What do you think?
2826492 2828076 Come on in.
2833665 2835083 Yo, come on.
2855812 2857022 Click.
2862653 2864446 Yo, Adrian, you hungry?
2864530 2865906 No.
2865948 2867658 I got some things in there.
2867741 2870619 If you like sodas,<br />doughnuts or something.
2870786 2872955 Got a couple cupcakes.<br />Huh?
2873163 2874248 No?
2874581 2877125 I got some chocolate in there. No?
2885801 2887719 Hot in here, you know?
2889805 2891932 I could go for some music.
2897563 2898981 Yo, Adrian.
2899398 2902234 These are the exotic animals<br />I was telling you about.
2902317 2904444 These are my friends, Cuff and Link.
2904486 2907322 - I sold them to you.<br />- I know you sold them to me.
2907364 2909866 Remember you were working<br />at that pet shop?
2909950 2913412 First day you was there, and I came in<br />and bought both these animals?
2913495 2914621 I remember that.
2914663 2918417 I bought this bowl<br />and the animals themselves.
2918500 2921086 Some food, the marbles that<br />go on the bottom there.
2921169 2923130 Remember that mountain?
2923171 2927384 I had to get rid of that mountain.<br />They kept fall over and flipping.
2927634 2929386 <i>(SOFT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)</i>
2930846 2933682 Why don't you come over here<br />and sit down?
2935851 2938228 It's a nice couch. I don't know.
2940397 2943525 There's big bugs in there.<br />It's safer over here.
2946069 2947863 You wanna sit down?
2954536 2956079 These your parents?
2956163 2958415 Yeah, that's both of them there.

2975182 2976475 Do you have a phone?
2976558 2978435 No, I had it pulled.
2978518 2980354 'Cause people calling all the time,
2980395 2983148 and who needs the aggravation, right?
2983231 2984733 Interruptions.
2985108 2986860 Who'd you wanna call?
2986902 2989655 I wanna let my brother<br />know where I am.
2990447 2991573 Why?
2993241 2994868 I think he might be worried.
2994910 2998038 I'll call your brother,<br />if that's the problem.
3000499 3002751 Yo, Paulie!<br />Your sister's with me!
3002834 3005462 I'll call you back later!<br />See you!
3012094 3014388 You don't like the room,<br />do you?

3027651 3029861 You don't like the turtles?<br />What's the problem?

3035492 3037285 I don't belong here.
3037953 3041248 Well, you know, it's okay,<br />'cause you're my guest.

3058640 3061184 I'm not sure I know you well enough.

3064813 3067649 Yo, Adrian,<br />I ain't so comfortable either.
3070068 3071611 I should go.

3207330 3209624 We'll get you in shape.<br />How's your weight?
3209708 3212586 - 175.<br />- Hey, Rock. How you doing?
3212627 3214838 Mick was looking for<br />you up there, man.
3214921 3217132 - For me? You're sure?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
3217215 3219342 He's looking for you.<br />Get up there and see him.

3238153 3239988 You got something for me?
3240071 3242908 Yeah, there was some guy<br />from Miles Jergens looking for you.
3242991 3246494 They need sparring partners<br />for Apollo Creed. There's the card.
3246536 3248246 - When was he here?<br />- About an hour ago.
3248330 3251625 They're probably looking<br />for sparring partners for Creed.
3251666 3254169 I said that before,<br />you dumb Dago!
3255670 3258882 I been coming here for six years, and<br />six years you been sticking it to me.
3258965 3261509 - How come?<br />- You don't wanna know!
3261551 3263345 Yeah, I wanna know how come.
3263386 3265430 - You wanna know?<br />- I wanna know now!
3265513 3267557 Okay, I'm gonna tell you!
3267641 3271686 You had the talent to become<br />a good fighter, and instead of that,
3271770 3275899 you became a leg breaker<br />for some cheap, second-rate loan shark!
3276858 3278026 It's a living.
3278068 3279903 It's a waste of life!
3298505 3300298 Yes. May I help you?

3316189 3318608 Mr. Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.
3319150 3320276 Fine.
3321069 3323571 - Please go in, Mr. Balboa.<br />- Can I have that?
3323613 3326074 - Oh, certainly.<br />- Thanks.
3330829 3332247 Mr. Balboa.
3332956 3334749 How are you?<br />George Jergens.
3334833 3336459 Take a chair, please.
3336543 3337752 Thanks.
3339587 3341006 Mr. Balboa.
3341589 3343425 Call me Rocky.
3343508 3345593 Rocky, you got any representation?
3345635 3347137 You have a manager?
3347220 3348638 No, just me.
3350265 3354102 Rocky, I've got a proposition<br />I'd like to make to you.
3354519 3357689 - About sparring?<br />- Beg your pardon?
3357772 3362277 I know you're looking for sparring<br />partners, and I'm very available.
3362444 3364279 - I'm sure you are.<br />- Absolutely.
3364362 3365864 Sparring with the champ<br />would be an honor,
3365947 3367198 and you know what, Mr. Jergens?
3367282 3369159 - What?<br />- I wouldn't take no cheap shots.
3369242 3371411 I'd really be a good<br />sparring partner.
3371453 3373788 You don't understand me, Rocky.
3374205 3376124 My proposition's this.
3376958 3379335 Would you be interested<br />in fighting Apollo Creed
3379419 3382130 for the world heavyweight<br />championship?
3386718 3387802 No.
3387969 3389512 Listen, Rocky.
3390472 3392474 Apollo's seen you fight.
3393266 3394893 He likes you.
3394976 3396728 He wants to fight you.
3396811 3398605 Well, it's just that, you see,
3398646 3401816 I fight in clubs, you know,<br />and I'm really a ham-and-egger.
3401900 3403777 This guy, he's the best, and
3403818 3407489 it wouldn't be such a good fight,<br />but thank you very much.
3407989 3409407 I appreciate it.
3409491 3413828 Rocky, do you believe that America<br />is the land of opportunity?
3415330 3416331 Yeah.
3417207 3418917 Apollo Creed does,
3419292 3421252 and he's gonna prove<br />it to the whole world
3421336 3424047 by giving an unknown<br />a shot at the title.
3424547 3426549 And that unknown is you.
3427300 3429135 He picked you, Rocky.
3430345 3432597 It's the chance of a lifetime.
3433723 3435683 You can't pass it by.

3472303 3475431 <i>Didn't you guys ever hear<br />of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>

3528359 3533156 <i>Rocky, now your payday<br />will be $150, 000.</i>
3533281 3534699 <i>Any comment?</i>
3536951 3539829 <i>- You got no comment, Rocky, right?<br />- No.</i>
3539913 3541372 <i>- Thank you, Rocky.<br />- Wait a minute.</i>
3541456 3544375 <i>I just wanna say hi to<br />my girlfriend, okay?</i>
3544459 3546586 <i>Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky.</i>
3547670 3550465 <i>You believe all this?<br />Microphones and all that stuff.</i>
3550506 3551633 You didn't.

3556554 3558473 Don't it matter he making<br />you out a fool?
3558514 3560141 I'd break his lips.
3560266 3563853 - He's taking cheap shots.<br />- Don't bother me none.
3563937 3568775 Yo, Rocky, I guess you'll be looking<br />for people to help you out.
3568816 3570151 Help what?
3570193 3571444 You know,
3571486 3573446 keep you living the clean life.
3573488 3575782 I do okay, you know.
3575823 3577825 You need someone<br />to help with the exercise
3577867 3581746 and someone standing by with a towel<br />or running errands?
3581829 3584582 Hey, yo, Paulie,<br />who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.
3584666 3587252 So I just think I'm gonna<br />train myself, you know?
3587335 3589504 Without such good people around<br />to help you,
3589545 3592006 you don't have such a good chance.
3592173 3594717 Einstein flunked out<br />of school twice.
3595051 3596302 That so?
3596469 3600348 Yeah. Beethoven was deaf.<br />Helen Keller was blind.
3600890 3603351 I think Rocky's got a good chance.

3615863 3617740 - What'd I do?<br />- Nothing.
3617824 3619409 Did I say something wrong?

3621327 3623371 That's right!<br />You didn't say nothing!

3651024 3653609 How'd you like hearing your name<br />on TV tonight?
3655403 3656904 I was shocked.
3656946 3658406 Why'd you do that?
3658448 3660241 You're putting me on, right?
3660283 3661701 Absolutely.
3662452 3665246 - What time should I expect you?<br />- About 7:00.

3688603 3689604 Yeah.

3704118 3707747 Listen, the reason I brought<br />you here is because
3707789 3710124 I wanna know if you got any money<br />for training expenses.
3710208 3711959 I got a few dollars.
3712043 3714295 A few bucks? Here.<br />Put this in your glove.
3714379 3717465 - What's this?<br />- $500. Don't worry about it.
3718674 3720635 You know, you ain't<br />never had any luck,
3720676 3723179 but I think this time Lady Luck<br />may be in your corner.
3723262 3726224 - What do you think?<br />- Maybe.
3726307 3728226 Thanks for the money, Tony.

3801674 3803801 Hey, it's a nice place here.
3804594 3807388 Anyway, what I come<br />to tell you is that,
3808764 3812059 that what happened to<br />you is freak luck.
3812101 3814061 - Yeah, freak luck.<br />- Ain't it true?
3814103 3816647 Look at the other guys.<br />They're good fighters, right?
3816731 3819400 They're colorful.<br />They got good records.
3819484 3821819 They fight their guts<br />out for peanuts.
3821903 3825865 But you, you got<br />a shot at the title!
3825907 3828409 Freak luck is a strange thing,<br />you know?
3828451 3830995 - Sure is. Can I sit down?<br />- Yeah, sure.
3832580 3835708 - What the hell are those?<br />- Domestic turtles.
3835750 3838294 The one on the top is Cuff<br />and the other guy's Link.
3838377 3839587 The rest are marbles.
3839670 3842048 Yeah?<br />They make good soup.
3842757 3843925 Anyway.
3844008 3846928 Look, I'm here to warn you.
3846969 3851516 You gotta be very careful about this<br />shot that you got at the title.
3851599 3854393 Because, like the Bible says,
3854435 3856604 you ain't gonna get a second chance.
3856687 3858814 Yeah. All right.
3858898 3860816 You thought of that, huh?
3860900 3864320 Well, what you need is a manager.
3865279 3867365 A manager. Listen to me.
3867448 3871160 I know, because I been<br />in this racket for 50 years.
3871244 3874539 - 50 years, huh?<br />- 50 years. I've seen it all.
3874622 3877959 - All of it. You know what I done?<br />- What?
3878000 3880002 I have done it all.
3880086 3883881 You should've seen me when I knocked<br />Ginny Russell out of the ring.
3883965 3885883 Out of the goddamn ring, I tell you.
3885967 3887969 September 14, 1923,
3888052 3892431 and it was the same night that Firpo<br />knocks Dempsey out of the ring.
3892473 3894892 So who gets the publicity?<br />Figure that out.
3894976 3896894 - Dempsey.<br />- That's right. But why?
3896978 3900815 - 'Cause he was champ.<br />- No! Because he had a manager.
3900982 3902483 I had nothing.
3903859 3906362 I wanna show you something.<br />I want you to look at my face.
3906445 3909782 Look at this. I got 21<br />stitches over this left eye.
3909824 3912326 I got 34 stitches over this eye.
3912368 3915830 You know I had my<br />nose busted 17 times.
3915871 3920501 The last time<br />was in that fight with Sailor Mike.
3920543 3923504 I got that clipping here.<br />It was a good fight.
3923546 3925506 Wanna read that?
3925548 3927675 Well, it doesn't matter.
3927758 3931262 Anyway, he put this<br />vegetation on my ear.
3932096 3933139 (READING)
3936767 3940688 You kind of remind me of the Rock,<br />you know that?
3940730 3942815 - You really think so?<br />- That's right.
3942857 3946277 You move like him,<br />and you got heart like he did.
3946360 3949947 Yeah, I got heart, but I ain't<br />got no locker, do I, Mick?
3953784 3955536 Anyway.
3955578 3958706 You know, when I begun<br />in this business, kid...
3960958 3964962 I wanna make a suggestion.<br />Don't drink that piss before a fight.
3965046 3967173 It's no good for you.
3967840 3969634 If you don't mind my saying.
3969717 3971927 Anyway, you know,<br />when I started in this racket,
3972011 3974221 pugs like us, we was<br />treated like dogs.
3974305 3976724 For $10, you got to<br />tear somebody's throat out.
3976807 3979060 But I never had no management.
3980436 3983439 One time, this son of a<br />bitch that I fought,
3983522 3985483 he put a nail right there.
3985566 3987902 - In his thumb.<br />- In the thumb of the glove.
3987943 3993074 He punched so many holes in my face,<br />I had spit shooting out of my cheeks.
3993658 3995451 Can you imagine that?
3995534 3999080 Anyway, when I tell you what I<br />looked like when I was in my prime.
3999163 4000915 I want you to look at something.
4000998 4003626 Look at that.<br />That's the way I looked
4004585 4006712 before these guys got at me.
4006754 4010549 That's nice. You didn't take very<br />good care of the picture, though.
4010591 4013844 Well, I never had no management.
4013928 4016138 That's the trouble,<br />but now I got all this knowledge.
4016222 4018974 I got it up here.<br />Now I wanna give it to you.
4019058 4021769 I wanna give you this knowledge.<br />I wanna take care of you.
4021811 4025064 I wanna make sure that what happened<br />to me doesn't happen to you.
4025106 4026941 You know what I mean?
4026982 4028818 Mick, the fight's set.
4028901 4031529 Listen to me.<br />I wanna be your manager.
4031612 4032988 You follow that?
4033072 4035282 Fight's set.<br />I don't need no manager.
4035366 4037743 But you can't buy<br />what I'm gonna give you.
4037785 4040204 I got pain and I got experience.
4040287 4042790 I got pain and I got experience too.
4043499 4044959 Listen, kid.
4045126 4046669 Hey, Mick.
4046752 4049380 I needed your help<br />about 10 years ago, right?
4049463 4052466 Ten years ago. You never helped me none.<br />You didn't care.
4052508 4054343 If you wanted help...
4054969 4059014 I say, if you wanted help,<br />why didn't you just ask me, kid?
4059098 4061684 I asked,<br />but you never heard nothing!
4062643 4063978 Well, I...
4067273 4068649 know I..
4068691 4070359 I'm 76 years old.
4070943 4072278 (TOILET FLUSHING)

4134715 4136675 At least you had a prime!
4137384 4139595 I ain't had no prime.<br />I ain't had nothing.
4139678 4142681 Legs are going, everything is going.<br />Nobody's giving me nothing.

5014344 5016930 <i>The reason we 're standing<br />in this refrigerated box</i>

5020266 5023770 <i>In a moment, he'll demonstrate that<br />for the viewing audience at home.</i>
5023812 5027440 <i>But first, Rocky, how did you<br />come to train in an Icebox?</i>
5028066 5030860 <i>Well, my friend,<br />the guy over there,</i>
5030944 5033780 <i>he let me in one day,<br />and I hit the beef here and liked it,</i>
5033863 5037283 <i>and since I've become a challenger,<br />the owner don't mind that I come in.</i>
5037325 5041246 <i>Is this a common training method?<br />Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i>
5041287 5043289 <i>No, I think I invented it.</i>

5061015 5063810 and make sure we get a picture of it<br />for all the newspapers.
