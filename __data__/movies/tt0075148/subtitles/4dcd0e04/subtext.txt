1484720 1487211 We're speaking now of your<br />much publicized bicentennial fight.
1487236 1490377 That's right, this is gonna be the greatest<br />sporting event in the country's history.
1490406 1493683 A gala occurrence with me beating<br />Green like he committed a crime.
1493708 1496200 Would you take a look at that guy?
1496225 1498755 I mean, where are the real fighters<br />gonna come from?
1498789 1501873 The pros. All we got today are jig clowns.
1501898 1504230 On January 1st,<br />the first major event in the country...
1504255 1507177 - Clowns?<br />- That's right. Clowns.
1507586 1510248 And in keeping with great events<br />throughout the country's history,
1510273 1514319 Apollo Creed will duplicate the cracking of<br />the liberty bell by cracking Mac Lee Green.
1514344 1516835 You callin' Apollo Creed a clown?
1516860 1518919 Well, what else? Look at him.
1519094 1521426 Stay in school and use your brain.
1521451 1524386 Be a doctor, be a lawyer,<br />carry a leather briefcase.
1524411 1528017 Forget about sports as a profession.<br />Sports make you grunt and smell.
1528042 1531500 - See, be a thinker, not a stinker.<br />- Okay, thanks a lot, Champ.
1531525 1534114 Hey, are you crazy?<br />This man is champion of the world.
1534139 1537349 He took his best shot<br />and became champ. Huh?
1537374 1539205 What shot did you ever take?
1539230 1542881 Hey, Rocky, you're not happy<br />with your life, it's nice.
1542906 1546000 But me, I got a business going.<br />I don't have to take no shots.
1546123 1547852 No one having gone more than...
1547877 1549154 That's right.
1550847 1552678 Stick that up your business.
1552703 1554568 What are you so insulted about?
1555318 1559846 Want me to take a shot?<br />All right... I'll take a shot.
1572001 1574893 - Rocky, how's it been going?<br />- Hey, Rocky, how 'bout a bottle?
1574918 1577250 - No wine.<br />- Come on. Just a little.
1580461 1582554 Rory, does your brother know<br />you're hanging out so late?
1582579 1584872 - Screw you, Go-go.<br />- Her brother knows.
1584897 1587058 Hey, these guys teach you<br />to talk like that?
1587083 1589536 - Stuff it, man!<br />- Never say that! Come here!
1590739 1592341 You stink up the neighborhood!
1594927 1596682 - You know, you can...<br />- Hey!
1596707 1597969 When I was your age,
1597994 1601327 there was only one girl in<br />the whole neighborhood talked like that.
1601352 1603200 That was it. Just one.
1603229 1604475 What are you doing?
1604543 1606511 It'll make your teeth yellow.<br />Don't do that.
1606536 1607939 I like yellow teeth.
1607963 1610325 - It'll make your breath like garbage.<br />- Maybe I like garbage.
1610350 1612386 Come on, nobody likes garbage.
1612562 1615053 Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth...<br />she wasn't bad-lookin',
1615078 1617569 but, you see, none of the guys<br />ever took her seriously, see.
1617594 1619624 They never took her out<br />for any serious datin'.
1619649 1621139 - Why?<br />- 'Cause that's the way guys are.
1621164 1623328 They laugh when you talk dirty,<br />they think you're cute,
1623353 1625344 but after a while, you get a reputation,<br />that's it.
1625369 1627014 You get no respect, you understand?
1627039 1630450 You get no respect.<br />And I gotta use a bad word.
1630727 1633218 Whore. You understand? Whore.
1633243 1634904 See, you use dirty words
1634929 1637609 and maybe you end up becoming<br />a whore, you understand?
1637634 1639295 Come on, Rocky. I'm just 12.
1639304 1641913 Hey, that don't matter that you're 12.<br />It don't matter.
1641938 1645999 You don't really have to be one.<br />You just act like one... that's it. Boom.
1646024 1649053 Hey, if you get a bad rap, you understand?
1649078 1653095 Twenty years from now, people are<br />gonna say, "Hey, you remember Marie?"
1653120 1654659 "No, who's she?"
1654802 1657295 "She's the little whore that hung out<br />at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."
1657320 1659982 "Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah,<br />now I remember her."
1660007 1663272 You see, they don't remember you,<br />they remember the rep.
1663401 1664732 You understand?
1666008 1667839 Hey, you got a boyfriend?
1667864 1669695 No, you ain't got a boyfriend.
1669720 1672382 You know why? Why don't you think<br />you have a boyfriend?
1672407 1675341 'Cause you're hangin' out with them<br />coconuts in the corner, understand?
1675371 1678943 You hang around coconuts, you get nowhere.<br />They're lemons. Lemons.
1678968 1682286 You hang out with nice people,<br />you get nice friends, you understand?
1682311 1684802 You hang out with smart people,<br />you get smart friends.
1684827 1687325 You hang out with yo-yo people,<br />you get yo-yo friends.
1687350 1689511 You see? It's simple mathematics.
1690787 1692118 - I hope you ain't...<br />- I won't.
1692143 1693398 What was I gonna say?
1693423 1696586 You hope I don't keep acting like<br />a whore, or I'll turn into one, right?
1696611 1698770 - Yeah, something like that.<br />- Good night, Rocky.
1698795 1700262 Good night, Marie. Take care, you know?
1700287 1701330 Hey, Rocky?
1701354 1702084 Yo.
1702109 1704043 Screw you, creep-o!
1711774 1715837 Yeah, who are you to give advice,<br />creep-o? Huh? Who are you?
1734940 1737724 - Are the doctor's reports confirmed?<br />- Definitely.
1737946 1739777 It says here Mac Lee Green
1739802 1744083 has suffered a severely cracked<br />third metacarpal in his left hand.
1744108 1745404 Damn.
1745996 1748250 Of course,<br />we can cancel the fight indefinitely
1748277 1749966 if you're set on fighting Green.
1749991 1752060 Hey, it ain't just Green!
1752398 1754559 What about all the time<br />Apollo has invested?
1754584 1756552 I believe we can find a solution.
1756577 1759083 Solution nothin'. You better find me<br />another ranked contender.
1759108 1760598 And I mean in a flash, Jergens.
1760623 1762376 Don't play games with my client.
1762401 1764869 Apollo's already done<br />a million dollars worth of publicity,
1764888 1767976 has made contractual obligations<br />with 20 different organizations...
1768017 1769786 He's not going to be embarrassed!
1769997 1774359 I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.<br />Ernie's fighting in France that same week.
1774384 1776682 Then get me Buddy Shaw!<br />Hell, he's ranked fifth!
1776707 1779733 Went to California and gained 50 pounds.
1780130 1783403 I get a hold of every worthwhile contender<br />and they all say the same thing...
1783428 1786236 Five weeks just isn't enough time<br />to get into shape.
1786261 1788593 Shape nothin', man! They're afraid.
1788670 1790661 They know everybody in the world's<br />gonna see this fight,
1790686 1792614 and none of them's<br />got a prayer of whippin' me.
1792639 1794732 They're makin' excuses<br />so they don't have to be the chump
1794757 1796787 to get whipped in front of<br />the whole civilized world.
1796812 1799804 All I can say is I'm a good promoter.
1799840 1803222 I've promoted fights in<br />every goddamn country in the world,
1803247 1807733 and I've broken my ass over this one.<br />But I don't know what the hell else to do!
1813192 1814352 I do.
1816773 1820529 Without a ranked contender,<br />what this fight is gonna need is a novelty.
1821184 1823175 This is the land of opportunity, right?
1823739 1826230 So Apollo Creed, on January 1st,
1826255 1829763 gives a local underdog fighter<br />an opportunity.
1830104 1834091 A snow-white underdog, and I'm gonna<br />put his face on this poster with me.
1834363 1836091 And I'll tell you why.
1836342 1838003 Because I'm sentimental.
1838649 1841379 And a lot of other people in this country<br />are just as sentimental,
1841404 1844237 and there's nothing they'd like better<br />than to see Apollo Creed
1844262 1845752 give a local Philadelphia boy
1845777 1849732 a shot at the greatest title in the world<br />on this country's biggest birthday.
1850012 1851958 Now, that's the way I see it.
1852568 1854621 And that's the way it's gonna be.
1854646 1859138 Apollo, I like it. It's very American.
1859422 1862769 No, Jergens. It's very smart.
1876839 1878534 Okay, I'll see you later, man.
1886969 1889193 - What? What is it?<br />- I just wanna check this thing out.
1889218 1893244 Now, you said pick up two yards from Snyder<br />and a grand from Cappoli, right?
1893269 1897103 No, no. No, no. Two yards<br />from Cappoli and a grand from Snyder.
1897128 1899103 - Two yards. Two yards.<br />- Write it down, okay?
1899128 1900671 Yeah, I got it. Got it.
1900696 1903096 Who's this girl you're going out with<br />tomorrow night?
1904386 1905546 How'd you know?
1905570 1909743 You know. Don't you think I hear things?<br />A lot of canaries flying around the docks.
1909782 1912250 - I'm going out with Paulie's sister.<br />- Hey, Rocky.
1912275 1914470 - What?<br />- I hear she's retarded.
1914495 1916587 She ain't retarded. She's shy, you know?
1916612 1918102 I'll tell you what to do.
1918127 1921425 Take her to the zoo.<br />I hear retards like the zoo.
1921450 1923782 - This bum gotta say that?<br />- Who're you calling a bum?
1923807 1926163 - I'm calling you a bum!<br />- Okay, relax. Relax.
1926188 1928285 Buddy's in a bad mood. It's his prostate.
1928310 1929800 He's always in a bad mood.
1929825 1931656 You know, you oughta count<br />your blessings, Buddy.
1931681 1933624 You're still a healthy person,<br />you know that?
1933649 1935685 - I don't like your face.<br />- I don't like yours, either!
1935710 1937541 - Kiss my ass!<br />- Move your shoulders down!
1937566 1940399 - Get out of the car!<br />- Relax, relax! Relax. My ears.
1940424 1942756 What, are you driving me crazy?<br />Both of yous.
1944840 1946550 - Buddy doesn't like you.<br />- Yeah.
1946575 1949305 Some guys,<br />they just hate for no reason, capisce?
1949330 1950875 - Yeah.<br />- Come here.
1952581 1955914 There's 50 bucks. You and your girl<br />Adrian have a nice time, you hear?
1955939 1957149 Thanks.
1958368 1960097 Hey, how'd you know her name?
1960184 1962049 You don't think I hear things?
1963015 1964748 - Hey, Rock.<br />- What?
1964773 1966604 - Remember what I told you.<br />- What'd you tell me?
1966629 1967789 Take her to the zoo.
1975838 1978534 - Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?<br />- No, thanks, Shirley.
1979860 1981786 What do you think about Billy Snow?
1981811 1982971 Fouls.
1984333 1985823 How 'bout Big Chuck Smith?
1985848 1988009 - Yeah.<br />- Nah. He's too old and dull.
1988767 1990428 Hey, Bobby Judd. He's a good boy.
1990453 1992421 No, I don't feel any heat from that name.
1992446 1994437 Joe Zach's a good prospect.
1995658 1998414 Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
1999774 2001477 This is what I'm looking for.
2002064 2003998 The Italian Stallion.
2004636 2007366 Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.
2007517 2009678 Look, it's the name, man.
2009703 2014369 The Italian Stallion.<br />The media will eat it up.
2014394 2017227 Now, who discovered America?<br />An Italian, right?
2017539 2020725 What would be better than to get it on<br />with one of his descendents?
2021078 2024312 He's a southpaw. I don't want you<br />messing around with southpaws.
2024337 2026497 - They do everything backwards.<br />- Southpaw nothin'.
2026522 2028008 I'll drop him in three.
2029532 2033935 Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.
2035050 2037450 Sounds like a damn monster movie.
2037475 2039744 Hey, what are you doing with that bat, huh?
2039769 2043130 I used to be deadly at stickball.<br />You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?
2043155 2044315 She's very excited.
2044340 2046604 - Look at my swollen hands.<br />- Yeah.
2046629 2049914 The joints from walkin' and<br />carryin' meat in and out of freezers.
2050149 2051288 It plays hell on the joints.
2051313 2053375 Maybe you oughta see a doctor.<br />What do you think?
2053600 2055693 I don't need a doctor.<br />I need a different job.
2055718 2058118 Different job. What kind of turkey?<br />Big turkey or small turkey?
2058143 2063137 Talk to Gazzo about me. Tell him<br />I'm a good man and nothin' bothers me.
2063307 2066470 I'd make a great collector.<br />Bustin' bones don't bother me.
2066495 2069018 Don't bother you.<br />A big turkey, right? Huh?
2069043 2072376 Gazzo's gotta come... forget Gazzo.<br />It's a bad job, you know what I mean?
2072401 2075802 - You got a match?<br />- Go to him for me. As a favor.
2075827 2078455 Yeah. Yeah. You know,<br />the last time I had a turkey
2078480 2082243 was when they were having a $2 special<br />at Horn and Hardog's about three years ago.
2082268 2084930 Last year me and the turtles had spam.<br />What do you think?
2084955 2087048 Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
2093110 2094832 Your sister knows<br />I'm coming for sure, right?
2094857 2097087 Yeah, yeah. She's very excited.
2098961 2100337 I'm all alone
2100362 2102727 Hey, will you forget about Gazzo, huh?
2103432 2106924 - I don't ask nobody twice.<br />- I don't ask nobody twice.
2107002 2110062 Stay away, baby
2111807 2114401 Hey, your sister... you sure<br />your sister knows I'm comin'?
2114426 2116353 Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very excited.
2116378 2117524 Yeah?
2120316 2122307 Paulie? You're late.
2123052 2126385 Called the hospital? She calls<br />the hospital if I'm ten minutes late.
2128390 2130055 How you doin'?
2130960 2132894 I told you she's very excited.
2135876 2138547 Paulie, why didn't you tell me<br />you were bringing him here?
2138572 2140277 Look at me. I'm not ready for this.
2140302 2142031 Would it make a difference if you were?
2142157 2144148 He's a friend,<br />and now he's taking you out.
2144173 2145504 No, I can't.
2146175 2148769 You're in the kitchen,<br />and I want you out right now.
2152548 2153537 Hey.
2154255 2155289 Hey!
2155985 2158596 Hey, I want you outta here instamatically!
2158891 2161499 I'm sick of seein' you hanging around<br />like a freakin' spider!
2161524 2163734 Go out! Live! Enjoy life!
2163759 2165249 Paulie, I can't go!
2165380 2168860 Don't get wise with me, now, huh?<br />I'm tired of you being a loser.
2169286 2170888 Don't call me that, Paulie!
2171004 2174337 Apollo Creed says<br />he'll be shopping for another victim
2174370 2178161 to fill Green's vacancy for<br />the bicentennial championship fight.
2178186 2180017 Why didn't you tell me<br />you were bringing him home?
2180042 2183409 - How do you know I didn't?<br />- I'm not gonna go, Paulie! I can't go!
2183434 2185163 - I won't go!<br />- Why?
2186615 2189880 Paulie, it's Thanksgivin'.<br />I got a turkey in the oven.
2190653 2193053 Oh. A turkey in the oven?
2199428 2200918 A turkey in the oven.
2207903 2209564 You want the bird?
2210358 2212349 Go in the alley and eat the bird.
2212374 2214342 Oh, Paulie.
2215144 2218272 I want you outta here! Get outta the house!
2218297 2220461 Go out and enjoy your freakin' life!
2225054 2226783 You hungry, Rock?
2233329 2236992 Yo, Paulie, listen. Maybe we just<br />better forget all this, you know?
2237153 2239109 - Just forget it.<br />- Forget nothin'.
2239134 2240624 Go ahead. Tell her somethin' funny.
2240649 2244050 Ain't nothin' to talk about. She's in<br />a bad mood, I'm in a bad mood.
2244075 2246884 You know how to do funny.<br />You wanna go out with my sister?
2246909 2249969 - Yeah.<br />- Well... come on.
2252581 2254192 I don't know what to say.
2267129 2269620 Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky.
2269775 2271174 Rocky, you know?
2272101 2273432 Listen, uh...
2275316 2279402 I don't know what to say, 'cause I ain't<br />never talked to no door before, you know?
2281240 2282760 I mean, what do I say to a door...
2282785 2284108 Hey, listen...
2284194 2285923 Come on. You're doin' fine.
2285948 2288348 I ain't doin' fine. I look like an idiot.
2288373 2290513 Keep doin' what you're doin'. You're funny.
2290538 2292529 I know all about these things.
2292554 2293953 I feel like a jerk.
2300529 2303020 Yo, Adrian, it's Rocky again, you know?
2303098 2304429 Listen, uh...
2305426 2309762 I know you ain't too happy at this moment,<br />you know, but could you do me a favor?
2309787 2312779 I ain't got nobody to spend<br />Thanksgiving with, you know?
2312908 2314669 So, uh...
2314694 2318289 how 'bout maybe you and I maybe<br />go out together, get something to eat.
2318314 2321044 I don't know. Maybe laugh a little bit.<br />Who knows, you know?
2321116 2322606 Would you like to, uh...
2324471 2327531 I don't know. Would you like to maybe,<br />you know, you and me go out together?
2327556 2329387 What do you think? Would you like to?
2335097 2336778 We're gonna have a good time.
2337700 2339531 We'll have a real good time.
2344473 2345804 Thanks for the bird.
2349778 2352372 I'm gonna turn the TV off.<br />I got a headache.
2365128 2367619 - What does your sister like to do?<br />- Ice skate.
2367644 2371527 Adrian, come on. You're lettin' the heat<br />out. Who pays the bills around here?
2377477 2380207 Listen, I don't want no turkey anyway,<br />you know?
2382393 2384190 But it was Thanksgiving.
2385127 2387391 - It was what?<br />- It was Thanksgiving.
2387416 2390078 Yeah, to you. But to me it's Thursday.
2415043 2417773 - It looks kinda quiet, you know?<br />- I think it's closed.
2417798 2420460 No, I think maybe we're just early<br />or something like that.
2421132 2422292 - Yo!<br />- Yo!
2422317 2424478 - We're closed.<br />- What?
2424503 2425929 I said we're closed.
2425954 2428552 Yeah. Hey, listen,<br />I'm gonna smooth this guy out here.
2428577 2431068 So just wait here for a few minutes.<br />I'll be right back, okay?
2431093 2433013 - We could go someplace else.<br />- No, it's okay.
2433038 2434972 Hey, listen, are you closed<br />to the general public,
2434997 2437158 or are you closed to everybody...<br />you know what I mean?
2437185 2441483 Look, it's after 6:00, it's Thanksgiving.<br />That's why there's nobody here.
2441521 2443580 And besides,<br />you ain't supposed to be in here.
2443608 2446029 So do me a favor and not stay here, huh?
2446060 2450053 - Would you do me a favor?<br />- Hey, come on. We're not operatin'.
2450128 2452790 Look... this girl here<br />ain't feelin' well, you know.
2452815 2455375 The doctors say she should go out<br />and exercise once in a while,
2455411 2457714 and ice skating's probably the best thing,<br />know what I mean?
2457739 2459229 So what do you want from me?
2459254 2462382 I want you to do me a favor.<br />You could see she ain't feelin' too good.
2462418 2465682 If you could let her on the ice,<br />I'd appreciate it. For a few minutes.
2465707 2467538 Ten minutes, ten bucks.
2467901 2469873 Ten bucks? How 'bout eight... eight bucks?
2469898 2472230 Come on. It's Thanksgiving.
2472353 2474344 All right, nine bucks, you got a deal.
2474369 2476667 You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.
2479197 2480539 Give her the blades.
2481895 2484969 - Aren't you skating?<br />- Nah. I ain't skated since I was 15.
2484994 2487470 That's when I started fightin'...<br />when I was 15.
2487495 2489827 Skating's kinda bad for the ankles,<br />you know?
2489852 2491143 Yeah.
2491359 2493268 You're a pretty good skater, are you?
2494768 2497601 You know, like I was saying before<br />on the way over here.
2497626 2500561 Fightin' used to be tops with me,<br />but no more, you know?
2500697 2503340 All I wanted to do at a fight<br />was prove I was no bum...
2503365 2505815 that I had the stuff<br />to make a good pro, you know?
2505846 2507177 You never got the chance?
2507202 2511036 Hey, I ain't cryin' about it, 'cause<br />I still fight. I kinda do it like a hobby.
2511061 2513417 I tell you what the trouble is...<br />I'm a southpaw.
2513442 2516206 - What's a southpaw?<br />- A southpaw means you're left-handed.
2516231 2518868 And a southpaw<br />throws your timing off, you see.
2518893 2521124 Other guys it throws their timing off,<br />makes them look awkward.
2521149 2522878 Nobody wants to look awkward.
2522903 2525863 - You know where southpaw came from?<br />- Nine minutes!
2525888 2529221 I'll tell ya. A long time ago, this guy...<br />maybe a couple hundred years ago...
2529246 2532647 he was fightin' in the...<br />I think it was around Philadelphia...
2532672 2534408 and his arm... he was left-handed,
2534433 2537808 and his arm was facing towards<br />New Jersey, you see, and that's south.
2537827 2540758 So then that's why they call 'em southpaw,<br />you see?
2540783 2546667 Southpaw, South Jersey. South Camden,<br />southpaw. You know what I mean?
2547929 2550420 I don't know. Things probably<br />worked out for the best, don't you think?
2550445 2552936 Never got a chance, though,<br />because you're left-handed, huh?
2552961 2555791 Well, that's absolutely true, you know.<br />Watch out.
2559810 2561801 I just dislocated my finger.
2562424 2565916 Look at that. No, wait.<br />Hey, it ain't your fault. Look.
2565941 2568933 See? Look, I had it...<br />it's an old wound, you see that?
2568960 2572005 Look. See?<br />Nothin'. It bends like that, see?
2572030 2573965 I originally done it...<br />look, push the button.
2573988 2575979 Bong. It works. It ain't your fault.
2576004 2578666 - Look, I'm gonna show you somethin'.<br />- Seven minutes!
2578893 2581952 Yeah, I originally done it.<br />I carry pictures of all my fights.
2581977 2584775 I originally done it in<br />the Baby Crenshaw fight. See that?
2584806 2587927 Big Baby's about the size of an airplane.<br />I broke both my hands on his face.
2587952 2590209 I lost that fight,<br />but that's a nice picture, don't you think?
2590234 2592513 See how it works there? Real nice.
2594074 2595635 Come on. You having a good time?
2596302 2600416 I'll tell you... you could see<br />I ain't too graceful. I don't move well.
2600441 2603822 But I'll tell you, I can really swat, you<br />know what I mean? I can really hit hard.
2603847 2607103 But I'm a southpaw, and nobody wants<br />to fight no southpaw, know what mean?
2607128 2608186 Huh?
2612608 2614596 You know how I got started in fightin'?
2615344 2616729 - Huh?<br />- No.
2617412 2619299 Am I talkin' too loud?
2619524 2621191 - No.<br />- Three minutes!
2621202 2625704 My father... he's, uh... my old man,<br />he was never too smart.
2625729 2628165 He says to me, "You weren't born<br />with much of a brain,
2628190 2631878 so you better start using your body,"<br />right? So I become a fighter.
2631903 2633131 Oh.
2633209 2635072 - You know what I mean?<br />- Yeah.
2635097 2637143 Why are you... Why are you laughin'?
2638100 2641160 My mother... she said the opposite thing.
2641185 2643244 What'd she say?<br />What'd she say, the opposite?
2644016 2648232 She said you weren't born with much of<br />a body, so you better develop your brain.
2648259 2649419 Did she say that?
2649444 2651674 Yo! Time!
2652291 2655313 - Can I ask you a question?<br />- Absolutely.
2656448 2658186 Why do you wanna fight?
2658210 2659986 'Cause I can't sing or dance.
2661712 2663549 Don't fall! Don't fall!
2664359 2666949 Hey, that was terrific.<br />I'm pretty good at this.
2666974 2668305 You like the way I skate?
2668330 2671491 The last fight I had, I had<br />with this guy named Spider Rico.
2671516 2674144 He busted my head up. You see that scar?
2674169 2677502 I'll tell ya...<br />things get pretty rough in the ring.
2686748 2689911 You know, with some people,<br />I'm very shy by nature, you know?
2690616 2691955 I suppose.
2695046 2697640 I say you're very shy by nature, you know?
2699027 2700358 I suppose.
2701211 2704975 Ey! Ey. The bum from the dark.
2705000 2706763 Get a job, you bum!
2707612 2712401 You know, some people think that being shy<br />is a disease, but it don't bother me none.
2712426 2713986 It don't bother me, either.
2715662 2719407 Then why'd I bother bringing it up, huh?<br />'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.
2721332 2723493 I think we make<br />a real sharp couple of coconuts.
2723518 2725679 I'm dumb, you're shy.<br />What do you think, huh?
2728560 2731723 I don't understand<br />why anybody would wanna be a fighter.
2732416 2734671 Hey, you gotta be a moron.
2734696 2738291 You gotta be a moron to wanna be<br />a fighter, you know what I mean?
2738316 2741619 It's a racket where you're almost<br />guaranteed to end up a bum.
2741877 2743248 I don't think you're a bum.
2743272 2747030 Well, I'm at least half a bum, you know?<br />But I'll tell ya somethin'.
2748537 2751793 The worst thing about fightin'<br />is the mornin' after, you know?
2751832 2753670 - The mornin' after?<br />- I'll tell you. Yeah.
2753682 2757450 The mornin' after a fight, you're nothing<br />but a large wound, know what I mean?
2757475 2759344 Sometimes I got pains all over me.
2759369 2763100 I feel like callin' a taxi to take me<br />from the bed into the bathroom.
2763125 2765211 Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt,
2765236 2768238 your face is all busted up,<br />your hands are swollen, you know?
2768263 2770979 Look at this face. 64 fights.<br />Look at that nose.
2771211 2772542 See that nose?
2772567 2774967 That nose ain't never been broken.<br />64 fights.
2774992 2779553 I've had guys bustin' on it, I had guys<br />chewin' on it, twistin' it, punchin' it...
2779577 2781383 I mean, whack! Boom!
2781408 2783887 These guys,<br />they hittin' my nose all the time.
2783912 2786904 Never broken. I'm very proud of that.<br />Isn't that rare? That's rare.
2787721 2790417 - Why do you do it if it hurts?<br />- Why do you think?
2792164 2795128 'Cause... you can't sing and dance.
2795143 2797634 Yeah, somethin' like that.<br />Somethin' like that.
2797659 2799377 Hey, you wanna come inside?
2802030 2803361 No. I gotta go.
2803386 2805377 Hey, come on. Hey, I got some animals.
2805410 2809141 I got these rare... very rare<br />animals inside. Come on. Come on in.
2809166 2811111 No, no. I gotta go.
2811136 2814057 Well, I gotta go, too.<br />I gotta go to the bathroom. Come on.
2814476 2815738 Come on.
2815763 2818527 - No, I gotta go.<br />- Hey, look at this face.
2818691 2822256 Is that a face you could trust or what?<br />Huh? Is it?
2822281 2824697 They oughta stick this face on a stamp.<br />What do you think?
2826321 2828255 Come on. Come on in.
2833528 2834994 Yo. Come on.
2855586 2856746 Click.

2864241 2865640 No.
2865820 2870236 I got some things in there. If you<br />like soda, some donuts or something.
2870699 2874065 A couple cupcakes. Huh? No?
2874487 2877560 I think I got some chocolate in there. No?
2885684 2887197 Hot in here, you know?
2889584 2891361 I could go for some music.
2897244 2898835 Yo, Adrian.
2899316 2902105 These are the exotic animals<br />I was tellin' you about.
2902149 2904174 These are my friends Cuff and Link.
2904199 2905558 I sold 'em to you.
2905583 2907244 Sure, I know you sold them to me.
2907269 2909829 Remember you were workin'<br />at that pet shop, huh?
2909865 2913038 First day you was there, I came in<br />and bought both these animals, huh?
2913163 2914425 Yeah, I remember that.
2914457 2916186 I came and I bought this bowl
2916211 2918941 and I bought the, uh, bought<br />the animals themselves, some food,
2918966 2920900 the marbles that go in the bottom there.
2920925 2922893 Remember? Remember that mountain?
2922918 2926752 I had to get rid of that mountain, though,<br />'cause they kept falling over and flipping.
2930525 2933096 Yo, why don't you come on over here<br />and sit down?
2933881 2934946 Hmm?
2935734 2937729 It's a nice couch. I don't know.
2940268 2943396 There's big bugs in there, you know.<br />It's safer over here.
2945793 2947502 You wanna sit down?
2953448 2956042 Uh, these... these your parents?
2956067 2957932 Yeah, that's... that's both of them there.
2958385 2959430 Is this you?
2959455 2961244 Yeah, that's me<br />when I was eight years old.
2961270 2963893 That's the Italian Stallion<br />when he was a baby.
2966361 2969694 Why don't you come on over<br />and make yourself comfortable? Relax.
2974900 2976413 Do you have a phone?
2976438 2977769 No, I ain't got no phone.
2977794 2981217 I had it pulled 'cause of people<br />calling all the time, and, uh,
2981242 2984471 who needs the aggravation, right?<br />The interruptions.
2984995 2986189 Who'd you wanna call?
2986768 2988877 I wanna let my brother know where I am.
2990225 2991385 Why?
2993074 2994697 I think he might be worried.

3015565 3017692 Well, it's only temporary, you know.
3017717 3019065 It's not that.
3024441 3027276 What's the problem? You don't like me?
3027501 3029833 You don't like the turtles?<br />What's the problem?
3029858 3032520 - I don't think I belong here.<br />- It's okay.
3035296 3036786 I don't belong here.
3037832 3041097 Well, you know, it's okay,<br />'cause you're my guest.
3042203 3045400 I don't... know you well enough.

3050378 3053541 Well, I... they're all the same. You know.
3058353 3060361 I'm not sure I know you well enough.
3062390 3064415 I don't feel comfortable.
3064440 3067729 Yo, Adrian, you know,<br />I ain't so comfortable either.
3069916 3071166 I should go.

3096424 3098085 Would you take off that hat?
3104884 3106818 I always knew you was pretty.
3108503 3110937 - Don't tease me.<br />- I'm not teasing you.
3114696 3116186 I ain't teasin' ya.
3117631 3120578 I just... wanna kiss you.
3122784 3125320 You don't have to kiss me back<br />if you don't want.
3126054 3127715 But I wanna kiss you.
3200195 3204544 - Worm, I heard you had a fight comin' up.<br />- Yeah, I'm gonna fight next month.
3205134 3208399 That's good, man. You come down to<br />the gym, we'll see that you get in shape.
3208424 3209712 How's your weight?
3209737 3212069 - I weigh 175.<br />- Hey, Rock. How you doin', babe?
3212094 3214395 - Hey.<br />- Oh, Mick was lookin' for you up there.

3238166 3239963 Hey, you got somethin' for me?
3240082 3242812 Yeah, there was some guy here<br />from Miles Jergens lookin' for you.
3242823 3244934 They need sparring partners<br />for Apollo Creed.
3244959 3246449 - You're puttin' me on.<br />- There's the card.
3246474 3248203 - When was he here?<br />- About an hour ago.
3248228 3251104 They're probably lookin' for<br />sparrin' partners for Creed, you know?
3251512 3254003 I said that before, you dumb dago!
3255437 3258895 I've been comin' here for six years,<br />and six years you been stickin' it to me.
3258920 3260276 I wanna know how come.

3261623 3263419 Yeah, I wanna know how come.
3263444 3265435 - You wanna know?<br />- I wanna know!
3265460 3267380 Okay, I'm gonna tell ya!
3267405 3271730 'Cause you had the talent to become<br />a good fighter, and instead of that,
3271755 3276522 you became a leg-breaker<br />to some cheap, second-rate loan shark.
3276683 3278014 It's a livin'.
3278039 3279904 It's a waste of life!
3298259 3300367 Yes, may I help you?
3305415 3309579 Oh! You must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.<br />Mr. Jergens is expecting you.
3309604 3311070 Just a moment.
3315910 3318593 Mr. Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.
3319113 3320171 Fine.
3320998 3322777 Will you please go in, Mr. Balboa.
3322801 3325175 - Can I have that?<br />- Oh, certainly.
3325200 3326406 Thanks.
3330591 3332252 Mr. Balboa.
3332726 3334737 How are you? George Jergens.
3334762 3337515 - Take a chair, please.<br />- Thanks.
3339446 3341277 Mr. Balboa.
3341355 3343346 - Call me Rocky.<br />- Rocky.
3343371 3346930 Tell me, Rocky, you got any representation?<br />You have a manager?
3346955 3348889 - No. It's just me.<br />- Oh.
3349975 3354309 Rocky, I've got a proposition<br />I'd like to make to you.
3354368 3357521 - Uh, sparrin'?<br />- Beg your pardon?
3357546 3359929 Well, it's just I know<br />you're lookin' for sparrin' partners,
3359954 3362316 and I just wanna say<br />I'm very available, you know.
3362341 3363399 I'm sure you are.
3363424 3365585 Absolutely. Sparrin' with the Champ<br />would be an honor.
3365610 3367514 - And you know what, Mr. Jergens?<br />- What?
3367539 3371107 I wouldn't take no cheap shots, either.<br />I'd really be a good sparring partner.
3371132 3373039 You don't understand me, Rocky.
3373866 3375812 My proposition is this...
3376585 3379090 Would you be interested in<br />fighting Apollo Creed
3379107 3381289 for the World Heavyweight Championship?
3386426 3387757 No.
3387782 3389477 Listen, Rocky...
3390251 3392082 Apollo's seen you fight.
3392971 3396532 He likes you. He wants to fight you.
3396557 3398491 Well, it's just that, you see, uh...
3398516 3401451 I fight in clubs, you know.<br />I'm really a ham-and-egger.
3401476 3404877 This guy... he's the best, and, uh,<br />it wouldn't be such a good fight.
3404902 3409345 But thank you very much, you know.<br />I appreciate it and all that.
3409370 3414109 Rocky? Do you believe that<br />America is the land of opportunity?
3415060 3416398 Yeah.
3417234 3419055 Apollo Creed does.
3419169 3424029 And he's gonna prove it to the whole world<br />by giving an unknown a shot at the title.
3424318 3428646 And that unknown is you.<br />He picked you, Rocky.
3430208 3432811 Rocky, it's the chance of a lifetime.
3433639 3435971 You can't pass it by.
3436864 3438475 What do you say?
3443337 3445495 All right, fellas, fellas.<br />That's enough pictures.
3445520 3447283 We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.
3447308 3449970 Apollo, how do you like<br />the city of brotherly love?
3449988 3453476 Well, just being in Philadelphia<br />makes me feel patriotic.
3453492 3457374 Beautiful people in a beautiful city comin'<br />up to me on the street wishing me the best.
3457399 3460630 I love my Philadelphia brothers,<br />and I'm proud to be an American.
3460655 3465992 Champ, Apollo, why did you agree to fight a<br />man who has virtually no chance of winning?
3466004 3468154 Look, if history proves one thing,
3468179 3471774 American history proves that<br />everybody's got a chance to win.
3471998 3474777 Didn't you guys ever hear of<br />Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?
3474802 3476891 - Apollo, Apollo, Apollo.<br />- Yes?
3476916 3479248 It is a coincidence that<br />you're fighting a white man
3479273 3481434 on the most celebrated day<br />in the country's history?
3481459 3482721 I don't know about that.
3482746 3484941 Is it a coincidence that<br />he's fighting a black man
3484966 3487323 on the most celebrated day<br />in the country's history?
3487348 3488940 Right on! Tell the truth, brother!
3488965 3491794 Listen, Apollo, tell me...<br />how do you feel about your challenger?
3491819 3493590 - How do I feel about him?<br />- Yeah.
3493615 3495204 Come here, Rock.
3495223 3497885 My main man, Rocky, ain't you Italian?
3497910 3499172 Yeah, I'm Italian.
3499197 3501170 Well, now, what does that mean?
3501195 3504209 It means if he can't fight,<br />I bet he can cook.
3504548 3505708 All right, Rocky.
3505733 3508395 Do me a favor. His lungs... punch 'em out.
3508420 3509819 Paulie.
3509844 3513249 But, Rocky, how do you expect<br />to fight Apollo Creed?
3513321 3517840 Uh, well, geez, you know. Creed's the best.<br />I guess I'll have to do the best I can.
3517848 3520521 Tell me, Rocky, just between us,
3520545 3523493 where did you get the name<br />"Italian Stallion"?
3523518 3528354 Oh... uh, I invented that about<br />eight years ago when I was eatin' dinner.
3528358 3533158 Rocky, now your payday will be $150.000.
3533183 3534582 Any comment?
3536130 3539122 You... you got no comment,<br />Rocky, right? No comment.
3539147 3540576 Right. Thank you, Rocky.
3540601 3543433 Wait a minute. I just wanna<br />say hi to my girlfriend, okay?
3543458 3544307 I, uh...
3544331 3546916 Yo, Adrian! It's me, Rocky.
3546941 3549933 Look at this. Can you believe all this?<br />They put a microphone on me.
3549958 3551921 - You didn't.<br /><i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>
3551923 3554100 Quit pushin', man!
3554753 3556223 Thank you, Rocky.
3556250 3559845 Don't it matter he's makin' you out a fool?<br />I'd break his lips.
3560217 3563365 - He's taking cheap shots.<br />- It don't bother me none.
3563673 3568804 Yo, Rock... I guess you'll be looking<br />for people to help you out.
3568829 3570034 Help in what?
3571464 3573242 Keep you livin' the clean life.
3573267 3575108 I'll do okay. You know.
3575617 3577346 You need someone to help<br />with the exercise,
3577371 3581565 and someone standing by with a towel,<br />or runnin' errands. You know.
3581590 3584320 Hey, yo, Paulie, who cared about me<br />yesterday, huh? Nobody.
3584345 3587074 So I just think I'm gonna train myself,<br />you know.
3587099 3591208 Without such good people around to help,<br />you don't have such a good chance.
3591998 3594664 Einstein flunked out of school twice.
3594834 3596265 That so?
3596290 3600469 Yeah. Beethoven was deaf.<br />Helen Keller was blind.
3600494 3602568 I think Rocky's got a good chance.
3608824 3610485 Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?
3610510 3614674 Hey, you lookin' to do a good deed?<br />Keep out of my freakin' life!
3615825 3617686 - What'd I do?<br />- Nothin'.
3617711 3621157 - What? Did I say something wrong?<br />- You didn't say nothin'. It's all right.
3621182 3624748 That's right... you didn't say nothin'!<br />Nothin' at all!
3626654 3628576 - I gotta go.<br />- Oh.
3629457 3631420 Where's the freakin' pretzels?
3634915 3638908 I got the pretzels!<br />Hey! We ain't got any beer?
3639794 3642178 I thought you were supposed<br />to pick up some beer.
3650678 3653169 How'd you like hearing your name<br />on TV tonight?
3655282 3658206 I was shocked. Why'd you do that?
3658231 3661717 - Come on. You're puttin' me on, right?<br />- Absolutely.
3662038 3665214 - What time should I expect you?<br />- Oh, about 7:00.
3666227 3667420 Hey.
3681755 3682878 Hey...
3684773 3688152 You know how I said that stuff on TV<br />didn't bother me none?
3688461 3689621 Yeah.
3692465 3693727 It did.
3704051 3707543 Listen, the reason I brought you here<br />is because, uh...
3707730 3710392 I wanna know if you got any money<br />for training expenses, eh?
3710417 3711975 I got a few dollars.
3712000 3714400 A few bucks? Well, here.<br />Put this in your glove.
3714425 3717189 - What's this?<br />- 500 bucks. Don't worry about it.
3718758 3720589 You know, you ain't never had any luck,
3720614 3724482 but I think this time Lady Luck may be<br />in your corner. What do you think?
3724507 3726308 Maybe. Maybe.
3726333 3728198 Hey, thanks for the money, Tony, you know.
3728223 3730623 It's okay. Don't worry about it.<br />See ya, all right?
3731905 3733448 - Hey, wait a minute.<br />- What?
3733473 3735407 You're in training, huh? Come on.
3735432 3736490 Hey.
3743859 3745589 - Yo, Tony.<br />- What?
3746037 3748369 You gonna show up at the fight?
3748394 3749761 Ringside.
3752370 3753605 I'll see ya.
3788962 3790054 Yeah?
3795667 3799384 Hello, kid. I seen your light.<br />Can I come in?
3799421 3801510 - Yeah, sure.<br />- Yeah, good.
3801541 3804001 Hey, it's a nice place here.
3804118 3808054 All right, anyway,<br />what I come to tell you is that, uh...
3808859 3812260 ...that what happened to you is freak luck.
3812285 3815618 - Yeah, freak luck.<br />- Ain't it true? Look at the other guys.
3815645 3819467 Now, they're good fighters, right?<br />They're colorful, they got good records.
3819541 3822203 They fight their guts out for peanuts.
3822235 3825966 But you... you get a shot at the title.
3826201 3829059 - Freak luck is a strange thing.<br />- Yeah, sure it is.
3829084 3831071 - Can I sit down?<br />- Yeah, sure.
3832392 3833882 What the hell are those?
3833907 3835636 Oh, those are domestic turtles.
3835661 3838357 The one on the top is Cuff<br />and the other guy's Link.
3838382 3840021 The rest of them are marbles.
3840046 3842276 Yeah? They make good soup, don't they?
3843402 3847201 Anyway, look... I'm here to warn ya
3847225 3851857 that you gotta be very careful about<br />this shot that you got at the title,
3851882 3857038 because, I don't know, like the Bible says,<br />you ain't gonna get a second chance.
3857345 3859107 Yeah. All right.
3859132 3860963 You thought of that, huh?
3860988 3865084 Well, what you need is a manager.
3865109 3867270 A manager. Listen to me.
3867295 3870890 I know because<br />I've been in this racket for 50 years.
3871155 3872554 - 50 years, huh?<br />- 50 years.
3872579 3875877 God, I've seen it all. All of it.
3875902 3878026 - You know what I done?<br />- What?
3878051 3879985 I have done it all.
3880010 3883741 You shoulda seen me<br />when I knocked Giny Russo outta the ring.
3883766 3887827 Outta the goddamn ring.<br />That's, uh, September the 14th, 1923.
3887842 3892207 And it was the same night that<br />Firpo knocks Dempsey outta the ring.
3892232 3894894 The same night. So, who gets the publicity?<br />Figure that out.
3894919 3896724 - Dempsey.<br />- That's right. But why?
3896749 3897943 'Cause he was Champ.
3897967 3902697 No! Because he had a manager.<br />I had nothin', man.
3903638 3906275 I wanna show you somethin'.<br />Look at my face for a minute.
3906300 3909650 Look at this.<br />I got 21 stitches over this left eye.
3909675 3912353 I got 34 stitches over this eye.
3912378 3915973 You know what?<br />I had my nose busted 17 times.
3916079 3920420 The last time was<br />with that fight with Sailor Mike.
3920427 3923487 I got that clip in here.<br />That was a good fight.
3923512 3924916 You wanna read that?
3925732 3927723 You... oh, it doesn't matter.
3927748 3931392 Anyway, he put this vegetation<br />on my ear.
3932389 3935881 Ah, Rocky Marciano.
3936779 3940905 You know, you kinda remind me<br />of the Rock, you know that?
3940930 3942090 You really think so?
3942115 3946643 That's right. You move like him,<br />and you got heart like he did.
3946668 3950314 Yeah, I got heart,<br />but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?
3953841 3955672 Uh... anyway,
3955697 3959030 you know, when I begun<br />in this business, kid...
3960733 3965067 Look, kid, I wanna make a suggestion.<br />Don't drink that piss before a fight.
3965092 3967041 You know, it's no good for you.
3967818 3969809 If you don't mind my sayin'.
3969834 3972020 Anyway, you know,<br />when I started this racket,
3972045 3974206 pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.
3974231 3976722 For ten bucks,<br />you gotta tear somebody's throat out.
3976747 3979517 But I never had no management.<br />You know...
3980468 3985647 One time, this... this son of a bitch<br />that I fought, he put a nail right there.
3985672 3987936 - Thumb.<br />- The thumb, yeah. In the glove.
3987961 3993446 And he punched so many holes in my face.<br />I had the spit shootin' out of my cheeks.
3993471 3995103 Can you imagine that?
3995684 3999347 Anyway, I'll tell ya what I looked like<br />when I was, uh, in my prime.
3999372 4002341 I want you to look at some...<br />will you look at that? Look at that.
4002366 4006521 That's the way I looked...<br />before these guys got at me.
4006546 4010377 That's nice. You take very<br />good care of the picture, though.
4010662 4011993 But I never had...
4012018 4014350 I never had no management...<br />that's the trouble!
4014466 4019087 But now I got all this knowledge. I got<br />it up here. Now I wanna give it to you!
4019112 4021469 I wanna give you this knowledge.<br />I wanna take care of you.
4021494 4025294 I wanna make sure that all this shit that<br />happened to me doesn't happen to you.
4025466 4026956 You know what I mean?
4027754 4029244 The fight's set.
4029269 4031567 Listen to me. I wanna be your manager.
4031687 4035267 - You follow that, do you?<br />- The fight's set. I don't need a manager.
4035808 4037799 But you can't buy what I'm gonna give you.
4037824 4039917 I mean, I've got pain<br />and I've got experience.
4039942 4042706 Well, I got pain and I got experience, too.
4043694 4045059 Listen, kid...
4045084 4047143 - Hey, yo. Hey, Mick.<br />- What?
4047263 4050198 I needed your help about<br />ten years ago, right? Ten years ago?
4050223 4052555 - Right.<br />- You never helped me. You didn't care.
4052580 4054314 Well, if you wanted help...
4054694 4058973 I say, if you wanted help, why didn't<br />you ask? Why didn't you just ask me, kid?
4058998 4061558 Look, I asked, but you never heard nothin'!
4062602 4063864 Well, I...
4065538 4067130 I, uh...
4067155 4070488 I know I... I'm 76 years old.
4075114 4078049 And, uh... well.
4086926 4088416 Where the hell is...
4111985 4113976 Took you long enough to get here.
4115071 4117232 Took you ten years to come to my house?
4117257 4119418 Huh, what's the matter?<br />You don't like my house?
4120226 4121557 Does my house stink?
4122662 4124391 That's right... it stinks!
4124847 4129262 I didn't have no favors from you!<br />Don't slum around me!
4130230 4132447 Talkin' about your prime.
4132472 4134463 What about my prime, Mick?
4134540 4136371 At least you had a prime!
4137383 4139587 I didn't have no prime.<br />I didn't have nothin'!
4139612 4142604 Leg's are goin', everything is goin',<br />Nobody's gettin' no nothin'.
4142629 4144790 Guy comes up, offers me a fight. Big deal.
4144815 4147511 Wanna fight the fight?<br />Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.
4147733 4151499 I wouldn't wanna fight. Know what's<br />gonna happen to me? I'm gonna get that!
4151524 4152923 I'm gonna get that!
4154560 4158851 And you wanna be ringside to see it? Do ya?<br />You wanna help me out?
4158876 4161676 Huh? Do you wanna see me<br />get my face kicked in?
4161701 4165910 Legs ain't workin', nothing's workin',<br />but they go. "Go on, fight the champ."
4166639 4167970 Yeah, I'll fight him.
4170910 4172639 Get my face kicked in.
4173630 4176224 And you come around here.<br />You wanna move in here with me?
4176249 4178183 Come on in! It's a nice house!
4179052 4182044 Real nice. Come on in and move. It stinks!
4183122 4184953 This whole place stinks.
4185839 4189331 You wanna help me out?<br />Well, help me out!
4189356 4191620 Come on, help me out. I'm standin' here!
4251424 4254587 It's only about 28 degrees.<br />We'll check that forecast in just a minute.
4254612 4257902 I feel very mischievous.<br />Very weird. Very...
4258765 4261165 Well, the thing is,<br />I got vinyl seats in my car.
4261190 4264250 When I hit the seats this morning,<br />I just went. "Whew!"
4264275 4266334 I'm thinkin', if I'm up,
4266359 4269717 everybody in the Delaware Valley<br />should be up. Do you agree with me?
4269742 4272621 I mean, at three minutes past 4:00,<br />what else are you gonna do?
4275694 4277525 - Hello?<br />- Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.
4277550 4280212 This is Don Cannon,<br />W-I-B-G Philadelphia.
4280237 4281829 - How are you this morning?<br />- Huh?
4281854 4283185 - Mrs. Kramer?<br />- What?
4283210 4287702 I think you have a lot of nerve calling me<br />at this hour in the morning! Goodbye!
4288761 4300423 W-I-B-G Philadelphia
4301296 4303560 Me and Mrs. Kramer are up,<br />and it's a good morning.
4303585 4307901 I tell ya, I need someone to snuggle with,<br />28 degrees. It's cold out there.
4307926 4310918 We deserve it. We've been getting away<br />with murder the last couple weeks.
4310943 4313461 Our high today could possibly be 58,<br />and that's it.
4313486 4315977 Tonight we're back down<br />on the 20 degree range,
4316002 4319665 a little colder in the suburbs,<br />and tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,
4319690 4323070 we may hit 40 somewhere.<br />But it's 28, it's awfully chilly.
4323095 4326155 Make sure you have it snuggled on<br />before you bring it out.
4468040 4469371 Come on.
4470209 4472700 Stinks in... hey, come on.<br />It stinks in here, you know.
4472725 4474909 Yeah... I know.
4476582 4478643 Hey, did you kill all these things?
4479355 4481186 No. Across the street.
4483623 4485955 This place is like an animal morgue,<br />you know?
4486659 4489321 - It's a little cold in here, ain't it?<br />- Yeah.
4494233 4495987 Who killed all these things?
4496755 4498245 What, are you crazy, Paulie?
4498270 4500534 If you don't pay Gazzo,<br />you end up on the hook.
4500559 4502891 Come on, Gazzo's a good man.<br />You know that.
4502916 4504885 Hey, don't get excited. I know that.
4504910 4508744 That's why I want you to talk to him<br />about me... the collectin' job.
4508769 4511258 Get me out of this stinkin' freezer.
4511283 4512944 Why don't you do yourself a favor?
4512969 4515802 Why don't you keep this job,<br />because you eat better, you know?
4516966 4518292 Moo.
4518565 4520339 Does it ever snow in here?
4521413 4526026 Uh... you and my sister.<br />How you gettin' along together?
4526699 4528026 How do you think?
4528632 4531897 Well, I'm not sure, Rock. What's the story?
4532183 4533815 About what?
4534018 4538268 What's the story? What's happening?<br />Do you really like her?
4538293 4539624 Sure, I like her.
4542048 4544312 I don't see it. What's the attraction?
4545591 4549083 I don't know. It fills gaps, I guess.
4549108 4551966 - What's gaps?<br />- I don't know. Gaps.
4551991 4555597 She's got gaps, I got gaps.<br />Together, we fill gaps. I don't know.
4557630 4559029 You ballin' her?
4559765 4560823 Hey.
4561381 4563872 Hey, you don't talk dirty<br />about your sister.
4565805 4567830 Are you screwin' my sister?
4570543 4574138 You see? That's why I can't connect<br />you with Gazzo, you know that, Paulie?
4574163 4577792 Because you got a big mouth, you know.<br />You just talk too much.
4578356 4580127 It's gettin' cold in here. I'm going home.
4580152 4583053 Cold in here? It is cold in here!
4583078 4585239 It stinks in here, and you stink!
4613841 4616002 Hey, you're breakin' the ribs.
4635574 4639066 If you do that to Apollo Creed,<br />they'll put us in jail for murder.
4641614 4643605 I'll see ya tomorrow morning, okay?
4656495 4658827 - I turned the heat up.<br />- Thanks.
4659428 4663592 You know, your brother's a good man,<br />but he's awful pushy, you know?
4673445 4676778 - You want me to rub you down?<br />- No, I'm just... I'm just sore, okay?
4676803 4678392 I'll just... just sit here.
4678417 4680456 - You sure?<br />- Yeah, I'm sure.
4684276 4686608 Hey, come on. No foolin' around, all right?
4687493 4688653 I'm tired.
4689435 4691608 Hey, Adrian, I'm serious now.
4691630 4695122 There's no foolin' around during training,<br />understand? I wanna stay strong.
4695801 4698133 - You're not kiddin'?<br />- No, I ain't kiddin'.
4701640 4703301 - You sure?<br />- Yeah, I'm sure.
4703326 4705658 Listen, why don't you just make the meat,<br />okay?
4708347 4710041 Okay, I'll make the meat.
4734088 4735266 Yo.
4736815 4738976 - It's okay.<br />- I'm sorry.
4739576 4740634 Hey.
4765271 4767603 Right, right. Left, left.
4769361 4771104 Underneath. Come on, underneath.
4771610 4774526 Underneath, underneath, underneath.<br />Come on!
4774551 4775882 Hold it. Hold it.
4775907 4778592 Hold it, Rock, will ya? You drive me crazy.
4778617 4780949 You're so sloppy<br />because you're off balance.
4780974 4784137 Let's try this. Now, take this string.<br />Tie it to both ankles.
4784162 4786133 Leave about two feet of slack.
4786158 4787750 I ain't never had good footwork.
4787775 4789766 Never mind footwork.<br />Now you're all balanced.
4789785 4794962 Marciano had the same problem,<br />and this string cured it.
4794967 4796127 Here's the idea
4796152 4799713 that if you can move and you can hit<br />without breaking the string,
4799738 4803200 you got balance.<br />You become a very dangerous person.
4803225 4805216 - You follow?<br />- You're lookin' good, Rock.
4805241 4806572 - Thanks.<br />- Let's go.
4806597 4808455 That's it. That's it. Underneath.
4808480 4810072 - Hey, Rock.<br />- What?
4810097 4812497 - How 'bout you give us your autograph?<br />- Get outta here!
4812522 4815457 Don't you ever interrupt me<br />while I'm conducting business.
4815482 4817916 Move your little chicken asses out of here.
4818169 4822503 Listen, kid. You!<br />You lay off that pet shop dame.
4822528 4825156 Women weaken legs.
4826165 4828429 Yeah, but I really like this girl,<br />you know?
4828454 4830285 Then let her train ya!
4833044 4836605 - Okay, no more foolin' around.<br />- Okay. Now hit it.
4838410 4840674 Women weaken legs, huh?
4845184 4847015 - Yo, Rock.<br />- Yo, Rocky.
4853726 4854784 Yo.
4856295 4857353 Yo.
4857378 4859073 Yo, you look great.
4860011 4861842 - Really?<br />- Oh, yeah.
4861867 4864479 Terrific. I mean,<br />you could be a heartbreaker.
4864943 4866742 You'll walk down the street<br />breaking hearts,
4866772 4868831 the way you're lookin'... very sharp.
4869245 4871385 I got... I got another surprise for you.
4871410 4872570 What?
4873412 4878042 Hey, Butkus! Hey, Butkus!<br />Come here, kid! Come here!
4878067 4879791 To keep you company when you run.
4885159 4888237 Come on in and meet the family.<br />The owner ever come back?
4888262 4891390 - He's yours. He's yours if you want him.<br />- Do I want him? Come here!
4891415 4893246 What's he eat... this dog?
4893271 4896002 - He eats little turtles.<br />- Yo, Butkus!
4919693 4923690 What's that, Butkus, huh?<br />Whose truck is this? Come on.
4925865 4928197 One call from me, you're a celebrity.
4930639 4933574 - You're gonna need exposure.<br />- Oh, don't breathe on me, Paulie!
4933599 4936250 That's the big time!<br />Don't I know about these things?
4936275 4938505 You don't know nothin'!<br />What do these guys want from me?
4938530 4940191 To watch you train! Boom.
4940216 4943023 What is the matter with you, Paulie?<br />This was supposed to be private.
4943048 4945642 - I'm doin' you a favor!<br />- You ain't doin' me no favors!
4945667 4947428 You're embarrassin' me<br />in front of everybody,
4947453 4949853 you make me look bad<br />in front of your sister...
4949878 4953712 You see this cigar? I'll stick it<br />in your ear. Don't do these things to me!
4953737 4956228 You should've called me up<br />or something... leave a message.
4956253 4957914 Don't do that!
4958130 4959859 My sister really likes you.
4961672 4964334 I'm gonna kill you one of these days,<br />I swear to God!
4964359 4965417 Come on. Come on.
4965442 4967307 - Baby!<br />- Baby.
4967754 4971485 Here he is, the next<br />heavyweight champ, Rocky Balboa!
4971510 4973000 Hi, there. Rocky Balboa.
4973025 4975619 Listen, we wanna get a brief interview<br />with you. It won't take long.
4975644 4977191 - What about me?<br />- What about you?
4977216 4979707 - I'm in charge of the meat.<br />- Fine. Will you stand behind it, please?
4979732 4981893 Listen, just settle yourself in.<br />Just relax.
4981918 4984751 What we're going to do is<br />just ask you a few questions, Rocky.
4984776 4987385 Just a few questions about<br />your unique training method.
4987410 4991055 Talk to the folks at home. They really<br />wanna know how you got into this.
4991069 4992951 I mean, this isn't an everyday thing.
4992985 4994475 Jimmy, you guys ready? Let's roll.
4994500 4996331 Rocky, why don't you turn right<br />around here.
4996356 4998347 Just don't take no cheap shots, you know?
4998372 5000514 No, I won't do that. Just relax, Rocky.
5000539 5003872 Today we're here with<br />heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.
5003897 5007073 - The reason we're standing...<br />- The meat guy's stickin' his face in.
5008162 5010323 Let's try it again, Rocky.
5010979 5014528 Today we're here with<br />heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.
5014553 5016953 The reason we're standing<br />in this refrigerated box
5016978 5020243 is that Mr. Balboa has<br />an unusual method of training.
5020268 5023922 In a moment, he's going to demonstrate<br />that for the viewing audience at home.
5023947 5027940 But first, Rocky,<br />how did you come to train in an icebox?
5027965 5030511 Uh, well, my friend, the guy over there,
5030536 5033596 let me in one day and I hit<br />the beef here and kinda liked it.
5033621 5037284 And since I become a challenger,<br />the owner don't mind that I come in.
5037309 5041370 Is this a common training method?<br />Do other fighters pound raw meat?
5041395 5043226 No, I think I invented it.
5043360 5046693 Don't forget to confirm the reservation<br />for my people at ringside,
5046718 5048845 and be sure to fly my barber to Philly.
5053236 5056069 How much is being channeled into<br />West Coast closed circuit advertising?
5056094 5058494 - $300,000.<br />- Make it 450.
5058519 5060680 And send the mayor's wife<br />200 roses from me,
5060705 5063765 and make sure we get a picture of it<br />for all the newspapers.
5063790 5066623 Do you wanna run the 15 radio spots<br />in the Midwest?
5066648 5069816 I think you could spend your money<br />better in Canadian publicity.
5069841 5072173 By the way... I've got<br />a couple of friends up in Toronto
5072198 5074291 who'd probably be able<br />to get you a good tax break.
5074706 5076987 George, I like your friends.
5084626 5088785 Hey, Champ, you oughta come look<br />at this boy you're gonna fight on TV.
5089695 5092712 - Looks like he means business.<br />- Yeah, I mean business, too.
5093378 5095209 Shirley, we got any more coffee out there?
5095234 5097634 Oh, certainly, Mr. Creed.<br />I'll get you some right away.
5097659 5100252 After the fight, I may just retire<br />and run for emperor.
5100817 5102870 The arena's the only program concession,
5102895 5107057 and the gross rental of the arena<br />is gonna include the 400 ushers, right?
5115473 5120706 Diana Lewis, in the meat house<br />with southpaw Rocky Balboa.
5167367 5168891 And he called the reporters?
5168916 5171510 Yeah, it threw<br />my whole training schedule off.
5171535 5173833 Don't be mad at him.<br />He's just trying to help.
5174098 5177090 Adrian, I ain't mad, it's just that, uh,
5177115 5179276 when a reporter's around,<br />I get out of joint
5179301 5181963 'cause they take cheap shots,<br />and Paulie knows that.
5182731 5185632 Paulie keeps askin' me<br />for a job all the time,
5185657 5188377 but he don't know nothin' about fightin'.
5188721 5190450 Are you gonna say anything to him?
5191961 5195143 What's to say? I just don't know<br />what he wants from me.
5197669 5199924 I don't want nothin' from you.
5200578 5202651 I don't want nothin' from you.
5203593 5206118 This ain't no charity case.
5206398 5207888 Get outta my house.
5207913 5209676 It's not just your house.
5210582 5212243 You ain't no friend no more.
5213132 5216363 - Get out of my house, I just says.<br />- Don't talk to him like that.
5216388 5218729 Both of you get out of my house.
5218754 5219940 Yo.
5220628 5222823 It's cold outside, Paulie.
5232571 5234732 I don't want you messin' her,
5234757 5237487 and I don't raise you<br />to go with this scum bum!
5237512 5239419 Come on! Wanna hit on me? Come on!
5239444 5242436 I'll break both your arms<br />so they don't work for ya!
5246151 5248642 That's right! I'm not good enough<br />to meet with Gazzo...
5248667 5249930 That's what I think of Gazzo!
5249955 5252355 Now you're a big-shot fighter<br />on your way up,
5252380 5254541 you don't even throw a crumb<br />to your friend Paulie!
5254566 5256830 When I go<br />and get you meat every morning!
5256855 5259517 You forgot that!<br />Then I even give you my sister, too!
5259542 5261129 Only a pig would say that!
5261153 5262563 I'm a pig?
5262834 5264766 A pig gives you the best?
5265704 5268366 You're such a loser!<br />I don't get married because of you!
5269574 5271804 You can't live by yourself!
5271829 5275321 I put you two together!<br />And you... don't you forget it!
5275346 5276836 You owe me!
5279425 5281762 - You owe me!<br />- What do I owe you?
5281787 5284203 You're supposed to be good to me.
5284228 5287734 What do I owe you, Paulie?<br />What do I owe ya?
5287759 5289420 I treat you good!
5289445 5292881 I cook for you, I clean for you,<br />I pick up your dirty clothes!
5292906 5296813 I take care of you, Paulie!<br />I don't owe you nothin'!
5296838 5299758 And you made me feel like a loser!
5300639 5302470 I'm not a loser!
5302495 5304445 - You're busted!<br />- What?
5304943 5306391 You're not a virgin!
5306845 5308903 You let him into your pants!
5308927 5310337 She's busted!
5313499 5315433 I can't haul meat no more!
5346251 5347741 You want a roommate?
5352791 5354281 Absolutely.
5355879 5358461 Okay, now, when you walk into the ring
5358486 5361148 with the number one heavyweight<br />of the world,
5361173 5362765 you'll be ready, won't ya?
5362790 5367955 Why? Because I waited for 50 years<br />to make you ready.
5368178 5370500 You'll be able to spit nails, kid.
5370909 5375212 Like the guy says, you're gonna eat<br />lightning and you're gonna crap thunder.
5375237 5378229 You're gonna become<br />a very dangerous person.
5378254 5380415 - Yo, Mickey.<br />- Hey! How are ya?
5380440 5384922 Oh, Rock. I want you to meet<br />our cutman here, Al Salvani.
5384947 5387031 - Take a look at his eye.<br />- How're you doin'?
5387056 5389336 - That's right.<br />- It ain't bad. I seen worse.
5389361 5390851 You ain't so bad yourself.
5390876 5393470 - Cover up. Things'll be okay.<br />- Cover up? You cover up.
5393495 5395398 Go and take a shower, will ya?
5395423 5397523 Okay, Mick. I'll see ya tomorrow.
5398810 5401643 You covered that Whitmar fight, didn't you?
5401668 5403016 That's why you wanted me.
5403041 5405805 Listen, we got a winner here!<br />We got a chance!
5405830 5408321 He goes to the body<br />like nobody you've ever seen.
5408346 5411844 You just stand by, boy. We're gonna win.
5418757 5421624 Hey, Rock, It's okay I talk to ya?
5422097 5424920 Okay you talk to me? Sure.
5425730 5428324 I figured some angle<br />to make some money off your name.
5428349 5429703 My name?
5430302 5434033 - How's that?<br />- Advertisin'. I know about that stuff.
5435907 5438899 What do you know about advertisin'? Huh?
5441479 5444710 Hey, you can make money off my name,<br />make it, okay?
5444735 5446414 I'm gonna take a shower.
5447385 5449961 - Wanna help me off with these?<br />- Sure.
5545917 5546941 You're gonna kill him!
5718260 5721787 Rocky. What brings you here tonight?
5722884 5725352 Mr. Jergens, the poster's wrong.
5725575 5726906 What do you mean?
5727319 5730264 Well, I'm wearin' white pants<br />with a red stripe.
5734215 5738938 It doesn't really matter, does it?<br />I'm sure you're gonna give us a great show.
5740578 5742569 Try to get some rest, kid.
5743481 5744743 Good night.
5836474 5838066 I can't do it.
5840955 5842115 What?
5843181 5844842 I can't beat him.
5846317 5847579 Apollo?
5848392 5849552 Yeah.
5850820 5854082 I've been out there walkin' around,<br />thinkin'.
5855827 5859191 I mean, who am I kiddin'?<br />I ain't even in the guy's league.
5864467 5865798 What are we gonna do?
5877615 5879014 I don't know.
5885578 5887239 You worked so hard.
5889260 5892752 It don't matter,<br />'cause I was nobody before.
5894832 5896129 Don't say that.
5897079 5901165 Oh, come on, Adrian. It's true.<br />I was nobody.
5902907 5905068 But it don't matter either, you know?
5906811 5908403 So, I was thinkin'...
5909881 5912714 It really don't matter<br />if I lose this fight.
5914619 5917782 It really don't matter<br />if this guy opens my head, either.
5919757 5922419 'Cause all I wanna do is go the distance.
5927131 5929725 Nobody's ever gone the distance with Creed.
5931102 5933434 And if I can go that distance...
5934707 5937938 ...see, if that bell rings<br />and I'm still standin'...
5943148 5946879 ...I'm gonna know<br />for the first time in my life, you see...
5948453 5951613 ...that I weren't just another bum<br />from the neighborhood.
6019025 6021084 Time, kid. Let's go.
6023940 6025598 I'll wait for you here.
6028061 6030746 Or how 'bout I wait here<br />and you fight, huh?
6031836 6034327 You're lookin' very great today,<br />you know that?
6036958 6040291 I gotta go now, but, uh,<br />don't you leave town, huh?
6041369 6043551 Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it.
6044539 6046029 Good luck.
6046662 6049825 Say, Adrian, you don't think<br />this robe is too baggy, huh?
6050351 6051441 Good luck.
6051466 6052797 Don't leave town.
6055573 6059539 I'd like to have you meet my colleague<br />workin' the fight with me, Stu Hansen.
6059564 6060622 Thank you, Bill Baldwin.
6060647 6063871 The electricity is all over<br />the place tonight as Rocky Balboa...
6065437 6067098 Hey, what the hell is that?
6067103 6069653 I trained you to be a fighter,<br />not a billboard.
6069674 6072507 - I'm doin' it for a friend.<br />- What do you get out of it?
6072532 6074591 Paulie gets three grand, I get the robe.
6074616 6075776 Shrewd.
6076424 6078824 The story about tonight's fight,<br />their difference in style,
6078823 6081248 you can quote a recent<br />sports magazine which said,
6081273 6083434 "Could be the caveman<br />against the cavalier."
6083459 6085859 I noticed a buzzing<br />in the background now, Bill.
6085884 6088216 Could be the challengers<br />getting ready to get into the ring.
6088249 6091771 Rocky! Look at my date. Cost me $200.
6091796 6094287 - 250.<br />- I gotta go. I gotta work.
6094312 6096303 - How's the robe?<br />- It's a little baggy.
6096757 6099812 A 50 to 1 underdog<br />living a Cinderella story,
6099837 6103238 and he's captured people's imaginations<br />all over the world.
6107979 6109571 We love you, Rocky!
6109596 6112656 - Good luck, champ.<br />- Hey, thanks for showin' up.
6113351 6115182 And his record... 44 victories.
6115207 6118199 He's got 38 by knockout,<br />and he's lost 20 fights.
6118224 6120488 Which makes me wonder,<br />can he stand it...
6120517 6123102 the stamina and the skill<br />to last the three rounds?
6123127 6125391 Because Las Vegas odds say no.
6125416 6128542 Rocky Balboa climbing into the ring now.
6128841 6130502 The Italian Stallion.
6130527 6132932 Some meat sign<br />on the back of his robe there.
6132957 6135619 Have you seen what that was?<br />Shamrock Meats, Inc.
6136507 6140341 A lot of noise coming from the back.<br />You could go deaf with that noise.
6140366 6142042 You have the spotlights.
6143281 6146444 Is that the world heavyweight champion<br />Apollo Creed?
6146469 6148960 He's in a boat... riding in a boat.
6148985 6150863 Is he supposed to be George Washington?
6150888 6154051 Obviously so. He's got the hat on,<br />the whole thing. Look at that.
6154076 6155636 It's been confirmed.
6155661 6160350 The world champion Apollo Creed<br />is doing an imitation of George Washington.
6162166 6163827 - He's throwing money.<br />- I don't believe it.
6163852 6167313 Remember we were talking about<br />George Washington throwing the dollar?
6167338 6168464 Throwing the dollar.
6168489 6171549 'Course, if you threw a dollar<br />in those days, it went a lot farther.
6171574 6173339 Oh, he's taking his...
6173364 6175769 White wig came off, the hat came off.
6180017 6182679 And the crowd is loving<br />every minute of it... look at that.
6182704 6184535 Here is the world heavyweight champion.
6184560 6186632 Apollo Creed, for you around the world,
6186657 6189888 he was dressed as George Washington,<br />the father of our country.
6189913 6191403 I want you!
6195566 6197898 Oh! Look at that! Uncle Sam himself.
6197923 6199618 I want you!
6199667 6201113 All of you!
6201138 6203003 "All of you." he's saying.
6203028 6204893 He looks like a big flag.
6204918 6207409 I want you. You.
6207434 6210289 - Is he talkin' to me?<br />- He's talkin' to you.
6210314 6212976 - Is he talkin' to me?<br />- Let him talk while he can talk.
6213001 6214769 I want the Stallion!
6215386 6217839 He says, "I want the Stallion.<br />I want the Stallion."
6219052 6222215 In foreign countries, during WWI,
6222240 6225175 there was the picture of Uncle Sam<br />with his finger pointed like that.
6225200 6228260 A recruiting poster for our fellows<br />in the service... the Army and the Navy.
6228285 6231363 - "I want you."<br />- That's what he's doing a take of.
6231388 6233356 - There he is.<br />- That's it, Creed.
6233381 6235105 Creed in three.
6235130 6237030 What do you think that outfit cost?
6247685 6249846 Ladies and gentlemen...
6250821 6257056 Good evening. A very happy New Year.<br />Welcome to Philadelphia.
6257081 6259572 Well, everybody who's anybody<br />is here tonight.
6259597 6260962 Time...
6261732 6268729 Time does not permit me to introduce<br />the many luminaries of politics,
6268754 6273240 show business, and the sporting world<br />who are with us tonight.
6273265 6278464 But I would like to present<br />one of the immortals of pugilism,
6278489 6282482 a champion in and out of the ring,
6282507 6288275 Philadelphia's own Smoking Joe,<br />the beloved Mr. Joe Frazier!
6298582 6300413 How you doin'?
6300438 6302429 Don't hurt him, okay? Go light on him.
6302454 6303616 Come on, now.
6303641 6307488 ...he's been in his career as a fighter.<br />Now he's coming over to talk to the Champ.
6307513 6309054 - Hey, how 'bout that?<br />- Hey, Joe.
6309079 6312571 - You've been ducking me long time.<br />- No, Joe. You're next, Joe.
6312596 6315394 - I want you, you understand?<br />- You're next, Joe!
6315419 6317063 They must be friends.
6325506 6327440 Joe Frazier!
6327465 6331959 The fight is on the way. Settle down<br />because it won't be long now.
6333508 6337766 And now... for the main event.
6342923 6344857 The challenger,
6344882 6351892 white trunks, weighing 190 pounds,<br />Philadelphia's favorite son,
6351917 6357082 The Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa.
6363754 6366245 And on my right,
6366270 6368431 wearing red, white and blue,
6368456 6372017 weighing 210 pounds,
6372042 6375478 undefeated in 46 fights,
6375503 6382391 the master of disaster, the undisputed<br />heavyweight champion of the world,
6382416 6384577 Apollo Creed.
6386657 6389182 I want you and you. You. You.
6391611 6394273 You, chump. I want you!
6394298 6397461 You boys both fought in Philadelphia<br />before, and you know the rules.
6397486 6402128 No low blows, watch your heads, no butting.<br />Shake hands now and come out fightin'.
6402153 6403983 Put your hands up there, chump.
6404008 6405999 - Come out fightin'.<br />- Come on. Come on.
6408279 6410008 Rocky's takin' it carefully.
6410033 6413696 He's just going over and being calm,<br />it looks like from here.
6414406 6416120 There goes the big hat.
6419456 6422619 I've never seen a fighter<br />that concerned about his hair.
6431375 6433467 And there's the bell for round one.
6434954 6438117 The fighters come into the center<br />of the ring, looking at each other.
6438142 6439473 Rocky just looking.
6439498 6444902 The Champion gives one of<br />the left-handed jabs right there.
6446454 6450129 The Champ's stinging,<br />the slower challenger jabs at will.
6450154 6454147 In fact, it just looks like Rocky's<br />blocking the blows with his face.
6454172 6458305 The Champion doesn't look the best<br />he's ever been, but he's really moving now.
6458327 6461915 Well, the Champion is smiling now.<br />He's toying with this man.
6463000 6465071 Trying to give the fans<br />their money's worth.
6467595 6470915 He's very clearly outdoing<br />the challenger right now.
6471716 6473547 I'll get you. Come on.
6473572 6477406 He's just trying to make this man<br />make him... see! Make him miss like that.
6478948 6481439 Oh, the Champ is just taunting him now.
6484530 6486210 He's dancing around.
6487702 6489453 I don't believe it!
6489627 6491925 - The Champ is down.<br />- Yes, he is!
6497956 6501357 Creed is down! What a surprise this is!
6502330 6505663 This is the first time the Champion<br />has ever been knocked down.
6507991 6511256 Six... seven... eight.
6511281 6513977 Appears to be all right.<br />A little glassy-eyed, but okay.
6515886 6518946 Let's go to work right now, Rock!<br />Come on!
6520224 6523557 Now Rocky coming back out,<br />and he's like a bull in a china closet.
6523582 6525005 He really wants it.
6527194 6528855 Boy, the Champion's coming back.
6528880 6531552 He's coming off the floor now,<br />and he's trying...
6532185 6534847 A left, a right, another left,<br />another right, combination!
6534872 6537705 Into the face!<br />And that's the Apollo we know.
6541538 6543055 Now he's taunting him.
6543080 6545173 He's taunting Rocky. "Come on, let's go."
6545198 6546708 Left. There's another left.
6547224 6548542 Another left.
6550371 6551677 There!
6553624 6555956 Left and right.<br />Rocky's got him on the rope!
6555981 6557141 Come on.
6557166 6558637 Okay, break.
6558662 6560323 Punch. Hit me. Hit me.
6563922 6567085 I tell you, there's no way we expected<br />this kind of hitting from him.
6567110 6569466 Oh, no way,<br />but with the ability of the Champion...
6574244 6577236 Apollo unloading a left, really<br />trying to get him up against the ropes.
6585672 6588588 They're leading him over to his corner.<br />Rocky can hardly find his way.
6588613 6590706 He's sitting down now.
6590731 6592571 I told ya! I told ya!
6592596 6593927 Your nose is broke.
6593952 6596408 - How's it look?<br />- Ah, it's an improvement.
6596433 6599800 I want you to quit chuckin' and jivin'.<br />I want you to stick and move.
6599825 6603317 Go for the ribs.<br />Don't let that bastard breathe.
6603342 6604741 The guy's great.
6605018 6608759 He doesn't know it's a damn show.<br />He thinks it's a damn fight.
6608784 6611526 Finish this bum and let's go home.
6612082 6614915 Stay to the body. The body!<br />You're doing great!
6618344 6620265 Creed got knocked down<br />at the end of the first.
6620290 6623885 He came back strong at the end<br />of the first, but he's working hard.
6623910 6627073 A smart left. Another left and a right.
6627098 6629623 And now coming into the corner again.
6636640 6639905 Oh, Balboa's taking<br />a tremendous beating here.
6645192 6647126 Oh, come on, man. Can't you fight?
6647151 6650143 Stop clownin' around here<br />and give these people something to see.
6651889 6653440 He says he wants more!
6654491 6658655 If you folks aren't aware,<br />you're watching a battle, I tell you that.
6662908 6664532 Balboa trying to fight back.
6664557 6666718 Oh! He tagged the Champ<br />with a tremendous hook!
6666743 6670797 The Champion is trying to get himself<br />out of there, but he just can't do it.
6670822 6673950 He is being barraged with lefts<br />and rights to the head, to the body.
6673975 6677987 Balboa is smacking the Champion<br />right on the kisser.
6678670 6682231 And the referee's... they're ready<br />to keep going. Look at that!
6682563 6684997 - Back to your corner.<br />- Put that chump back in his corner.
6685022 6686979 - Come on, Creed.<br />- Balboa doesn't want to quit.
6687004 6689619 Hey. This is gonna be a tough one.
6744014 6746346 Now he's got him. A left.
6756346 6758837 A hard left and a right combination.
6758862 6761626 What is keeping him up, Bill?<br />I don't know.
6764190 6766645 He can't even get his gloves up<br />to protect himself.
6766670 6768501 He needs to stop, Bill.
6774411 6776549 Down! Down! Stay down!
6776574 6779119 Apollo dancing around<br />with his arms in the air.
6789838 6793103 ...five... six...
6793879 6797682 seven... eight... nine...
6807377 6809208 Apollo can't believe it.
6826194 6829741 The Champion got a left to the ribs...<br />his right rib.
6829766 6831927 Oh, this has been a tremendous...
6837741 6840232 - Okay, Champ?<br />- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.
6840257 6843090 It hurts, though. He broke my rib.
6843115 6845536 I can't see nothin'.<br />You gotta open my eye.
6845561 6847392 - Cut me, Mick.<br />- I don't wanna do it!
6847417 6848633 Go on, cut me.
6849221 6850329 Cut me.
6850354 6851570 Try it.
6856093 6857583 Oh, God.
6857608 6860042 You're bleeding inside, Champ.<br />I'm gonna stop the fight, understand?
6860067 6863608 You ain't stoppin' nothin', man.<br />You ain't stoppin' nothin'.
6863678 6866511 - You stop this fight, I'll kill ya.<br />- All right.
6866536 6869515 - Go if you wanna go.<br />- I'm goin'.
6870385 6873218 You gotta go. You gotta give it all.<br />Give it all!
6873243 6875404 You gotta get him.<br />You gotta work on that body.
6879725 6882717 The crowd is on fire.<br />The 15th and final round.
6891516 6893916 They look like they've been in a war,<br />these two.
6903140 6905631 Oh, the Champion really tagged him!
6905656 6909387 And Apollo clearly protecting<br />his right side, his ribs.
6914818 6916410 Hard left and right!
6916435 6919672 - Look at the blood coming from his face.<br />- Oh, he's spitting up blood now.
6923560 6926427 A tremendous right hand by Rocky.
6926452 6928006 Go for it! Go for it, Rock!
6928250 6930156 Listen to this crowd!
6930913 6934713 Oh! Another to the rib.<br />That left hand again right to the chin!
6934738 6937679 Oh! He's got him up against the ropes!<br />Apollo the Champ.
6942112 6944945 Ain't gonna be no rematch.<br />Ain't gonna be no rematch.
6945547 6946937 Don't want one.
6957711 6960223 Rocky, you went the 15 rounds.<br />How do you feel?
6960248 6961306 I feel all right.
6961331 6963322 What were you thinking about<br />when that buzzer sounded?
6963347 6964718 Adrian!
6964756 6965508 What?
6965533 6967211 Adrian!
6967236 6968406 Rocky?
6968953 6970147 Rocky?
6970493 6972984 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />your attention, please...
6973009 6974203 Rocky?
6975523 6976828 Rocky!
6976853 6981187 You've had the privilege of<br />witnessing the greatest exhibition
6981212 6985376 of guts and stamina in<br />the history of the ring.
6985401 6987392 Adrian!
6988091 6989578 Rocky!
6989937 6994711 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />we have a split decision.
6998184 6999845 Adrian!
6999870 7001201 Rocky!
7001226 7002716 ...for Creed.
7005293 7008626 - No plans out there for a rematch?<br />- Ain't gonna be a rematch.
7008751 7012016 Oh, come on. I don't know yet, okay?
7012041 7013758 You heard him, ladies and...
7013783 7014582 Rocko!
7014606 7015774 That's my friend.
7015798 7016863 Rocko!
7017085 7019931 - Hey, you're breakin' the jacket.<br />- Let's go, Buddy. Come on.
7019956 7021355 Paulie?
