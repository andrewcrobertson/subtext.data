755020 756271 I'm broke!
756313 759483 Mr. Gazzo says I should get the 200<br />or break your thumb. You understand?
759566 762402 - Please, don't...<br />- What's your name again?
763278 766239 - Bob!<br />- Bob. Listen, Bob.
767282 769950 You wanna dance, you gotta<br />pay the band. You understand?
770034 772286 You wanna borrow,<br />you gotta pay the man.
772370 775748 Hey, I ain't emotionally involved, Bob.<br />You understand?
775790 778459 Give me some money.<br />Give me some money.
783047 784673 There's 130 here.
784757 786717 That's it. I'm broke.
786801 790221 Hey, Bob, you're still $70 light.
790721 793641 You don't have to break nothing.<br />Take my coat.
793724 795810 It's worth $50, $60.
796227 797895 Take the coat!
799480 800981 You know, you should've<br />planned ahead.
801065 803192 You know that?<br />You should've planned ahead.
803275 805611 We'll fake it. I'll tape up the hand<br />like you broke the thumb!
805653 808280 - Should've planned ahead.<br />- Gazzo don't have to know!
808322 811409 He won't be wise to nothing!<br />Gazzo won't be wise to nothing!
811492 814286 Keep the coat! Keep the...
843314 847444 He only had 130, but I think he's good<br />for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
847527 849863 Sure, Rocky. Bob's good for it.
851072 852866 That's it for today.
853950 857245 Tomorrow collect from Del Rio.<br />He's late three weeks. I don't like it.
857328 859664 Tomorrow, three weeks. Del Rio?
860081 862292 All right, I got it.<br />How do you spell Del Rio?
862375 864711 - How'd you do last night?<br />- I did real good.
864752 866171 - Hey.<br />- What?
866713 869089 - Did you get the license number?<br />- Of what?
869173 871049 The truck that run over your face.
871091 873218 Relax, Buddy.<br />Pull it over here.
873260 876722 I wanna let Rocky out.<br />I'm gonna talk to him for a few seconds.
899536 901455 Why didn't you break<br />this guy's thumb?
901538 903898 - How do you know I didn't?<br />- You don't think I hear things?
903916 905751 Didn't I give you<br />a job this morning?
905792 908670 - Yeah.<br />- Why didn't you break his thumb?
908754 912591 When you don't do what I tell you<br />to do, you make me look bad.
912758 915719 I figured... Look. I figured<br />if I break the guy's thumb,
915761 917137 he gets laid off.
917221 920097 - He can't make money.<br />- Let me do the figuring.
920181 922600 From here on in,<br />let me do the figuring.
922642 926687 These guys think we're running<br />a charity, they'll get off light.
926771 929273 From here on in,<br />do what I tell you to do,
929357 930858 because it's bad for my reputation.
930942 933694 You understand?<br />You got it, Rock?
934737 936030 I got it.
938866 940910 How do you spell Del Rio?
941244 943746 - Look it up in a dictionary.<br />- Come on!
943788 946999 I won't let that happen<br />no more, about the thumb.
948876 950169 You know?
951295 953005 So long, meat bag.
955841 958135 I should've broke your thumbs!
987832 989917 Hey, Rock.<br />Heard you did good last night.
990001 993045 - Absolutely. Should've seen me.<br />- Shouldn't you take a rest?
993129 995006 - No, my back is hurt.<br />- Your back?
995089 997174 My back is hurt.<br />You deaf?
997258 998801 No, I'm short.
1063406 1064949 Hey, yo, Mike.
1065325 1067994 Where's my lock?<br />Whose stuff is this in my locker?
1068078 1071288 It's Dipper's stuff.<br />It ain't your locker no more.
1073832 1076543 What you talking about?<br />It's been my locker for six years.
1076585 1078003 Where's my gear?
1078087 1080714 Mickey told me to<br />bag it and hang it.
1085344 1087596 You put my stuff on skid row.
1087638 1091725 I been in that locker for six years,<br />and you put my stuff on skid row?
1091767 1094228 Mickey tells me what to do,<br />I gotta do it.
1094269 1095729 Where is he?
1095771 1098232 He's outside working with Dipper.
1098440 1100693 - He's in a bad mood.<br />- So am I.
1111078 1112579 Keep your hands up.
1112621 1115416 Keep your hands up. Watch the right.
1115833 1117167 - Hey, Mick.<br />- Shut up!
1117251 1119419 To the body. Attaboy.

1135893 1139897 I been talking to Michael.<br />How come I been put out of my locker?
1139981 1143359 Because Dipper needed it.<br />Dipper's a contender.
1143443 1145653 He's a climber.<br />Do you know what you are?
1145737 1148030 - You're a tomato.<br />- Tomato?
1148114 1151284 I run a business here,<br />not a goddamn soup kitchen.
1151325 1153327 - Did you fight last night?<br />- Yeah.

1160042 1161461 He's a bum!
1162170 1165673 - You think everybody I fight is a bum.<br />- Well, ain't they?
1165715 1168842 You got heart,<br />but you fight like a goddamn ape.
1169217 1172179 The only thing special about you,<br />you never got your nose busted.
1172220 1175932 Leave it that way. Nice and pretty<br />and what's left of your mind.
1176016 1178727 I think I'm gonna go take a steam.<br />You know why?
1178810 1181521 Because I did good last night,<br />and you should've seen me.
1181563 1184107 - Big deal.<br />- You should've seen me too.
1184191 1185484 Hey, kid.

1262142 1264728 Tough day today.<br />They took my locker away.
1264770 1267606 I had that locker for six years.<br />It don't bother me.
1267690 1269274 Lockers are bad,<br />anyway, after a while.
1269315 1270608 People get the combination.
1270650 1274529 I must've had 20 bucks taken out<br />of there in the past 6 years.
1274821 1277657 Don't sound like much,<br />but it adds up.
1277740 1279784 Doesn't matter. Who cares?
1281744 1283997 Yeah, cold night. Hey, birds.

1295800 1298303 You need somebody to walk you home?
1298553 1299721 - No.<br />- No?
1300471 1304350 It's a cold night.<br />If you got the money, take a cab.
1304434 1306603 Too many creeps around here.
1307186 1309731 Every other block, there's a creep.
1310106 1312233 You can always tell a creep.
1314319 1316154 Listen. I'm gonna go now, okay?
1316195 1317947 I'll see you later, all right?
1317989 1321825 None of you guys get up. I know<br />you had a hard day in the cage.
1321867 1322951 So,
1323327 1326079 I'm gonna go home, make up a joke.<br />I'll tell you a new joke tomorrow.
1326163 1327956 Okay? Good night, Adrian.
1327998 1329708 Good night, Rocky.

1388058 1392479 Every day, every night, I pass by.<br />Your sister's giving me the shoulder.

1411248 1413208 She's a freaking loser.
1413250 1416545 Sometimes she gets me so crazy,<br />I could split her head with a razor.
1416586 1419547 - Don't get mental.<br />- You caught me in a bad mood.
1419588 1422425 - You're always in a bad mood.<br />- Adrian ain't sharp.
1422508 1424427 Adrian is a loser.
1424468 1426887 She's pushing 30 freaking years old.
1426929 1429265 If she don't watch out,<br />she's gonna die alone.
1429348 1431976 - I'm 30 myself.<br />- And you'll die alone.

1451746 1453789 You know? Come on.
1457960 1460129 - The girl's dried up.<br />- Who?

1517060 1519019 What else?<br />Look at him.
1519228 1521438 <i>Stay in school and use your brain.</i>
1521522 1524525 <i>Be a doctor, be a lawyer,<br />carry a leather briefcase.</i>

1528153 1531782 <i>- Be a thinker, not a stinker.<br />- Thanks a lot, champ.</i>
1531865 1534076 You crazy?<br />This man is champion of the world.
1534159 1536870 He took his best shot<br />and become champ.
1537538 1539540 What shot did you ever take?
1539581 1542793 Hey, Rocky, you're not happy<br />with your life, that's nice.
1542876 1546213 But me, I got a business going.<br />I don't have to take no shots.
1546255 1548335 <i>...no one having gone<br />more than 12 rounds with him...</i>
1548340 1551051 <i>- That's right.<br />- ...and that was Jake Dale last June...</i>
1551135 1554888 - Stick that up your business.<br />- Why you getting so insulted?
1555389 1558058 You want me to take a shot?<br />All right.
1558225 1559893 I'll take a shot.
1573447 1575950 - Hey, Rocky, how about a bottle?<br />- No wine, man.
1576033 1579245 - Come on. Just a little.<br />- Buy us some Thunderbird.
1580705 1582946 Marie, does your brother know<br />you're hanging out so late?
1582957 1585126 - Get lost, creep.<br />- Screw you, yo-yo!
1585209 1587253 These guys teach you<br />to talk like that?
1587336 1590214 - Stuff it!<br />- Don't you never say that to me.
1590923 1593426 You stink up the neighborhood!
1595052 1596888 You know, you can...
1596971 1601267 When I was your age, only one girl in<br />the whole neighborhood talked like that.
1601309 1603227 That was it. Just one.
1603394 1606480 What are you doing? It'll make<br />your teeth yellow. Don't do that.
1606564 1607899 I like yellow teeth!
1607940 1610380 - It'll make your breath like garbage.<br />- Maybe I like garbage.
1610401 1612236 Nobody likes garbage.
1612612 1615114 Anyway, this girl with the dirty<br />mouth wasn't bad looking,
1615198 1617700 but none of the guys<br />ever took her serious.
1617783 1619618 They never took her out<br />for any serious date.
1619701 1621286 - Why?<br />- 'Cause that's the way guys are.
1621328 1623413 They laugh when you talk dirty.<br />They think you're cute.
1623455 1626124 After a while, you get a reputation.<br />You get no respect.
1626208 1628585 You understand? You get no respect.
1628627 1631338 I gotta use a bad word, whore.
1631421 1633340 You understand? Whore.
1633423 1637427 See? You use dirty words, and maybe<br />you end up becoming a whore.
1637802 1639387 Come on, Rocky.<br />I'm 12.
1639471 1641848 That don't matter.
1641932 1645018 You don't really have to be one.<br />Just act like one and that's it.
1645101 1648813 Boom! Bing! You get a bad rep.<br />You understand?
1649147 1652400 Twenty years from now,<br />people are gonna say,
1652484 1654819 "Do you remember Marie?"<br />"No. Who was she?"
1654903 1657544 "She was the little whore who hung<br />down at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."
1657572 1659866 "Oh, yeah. Now I remember her."
1659950 1663495 You see, they don't remember you.<br />They remember the rep.
1663536 1665121 You understand?
1666081 1669375 You got a boyfriend?<br />No, you ain't got a boyfriend.
1669792 1672503 You know why? Why don't you<br />think you have a boyfriend?
1672586 1675381 'Cause you're hanging out with them<br />coconuts on the corner.
1675464 1677299 You hang around coconuts,<br />you get nowhere.
1677341 1679093 They're lemons. Lemons.
1679176 1682221 You hang out with nice people,<br />you get nice friends. You understand?
1682304 1684807 You hang out with smart people,<br />you get smart friends.
1684848 1687393 You hang out with yo-yo people,<br />you get yo-yo friends.
1687476 1689895 You see, it's simple mathematics.
1690729 1692231 - I hope you ain't...<br />- I won't.
1692314 1693399 What was I gonna say?
1693482 1696527 You hope I don't keep acting like a<br />whore or I'll turn into one, right?
1696610 1697695 Yeah, something like that.
1697778 1698904 Good night, Rocky.
1698988 1701282 - Good night. Take care.<br />- Hey, Rocky.
1701365 1704034 - Yo.<br />- Screw you, creep-o!
1711917 1714712 Yeah, who are you to<br />give advice, creep-o?
1714795 1716213 Who are you?
1735065 1738277 - Are the doctor's reports confirmed?<br />- Definitely.
1738569 1740404 Says here Mac Lee<br />Green has suffered
1740487 1744033 "a severely cracked third<br />metacarpal in his left hand."
1744491 1745868 Damn!
1745993 1750039 We can cancel the fight indefinitely<br />if you're set on fighting Green.
1750080 1752124 Hey, it ain't just Green.
1752416 1754752 What about all the time<br />Apollo has invested?
1754835 1756503 We can find a solution.
1756587 1757671 Solution nothing.
1757755 1760466 Find me another ranked contender<br />in a flash, Jergens.
1760549 1762551 Don't play games with my client.
1762593 1765179 Apollo's already done a million<br />dollars' worth of publicity,
1765262 1768182 has made contractual obligations<br />with 20 different organizations.
1768265 1769974 He's not going to be embarrassed!
1770058 1772435 I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.
1772518 1774479 Ernie's fighting in<br />France that same week.
1774562 1776731 Then get me Buddy Shaw.<br />He's ranked fifth.
1776773 1779609 Went to California and<br />gained 50 pounds.
1780234 1782111 I called<br />every worthwhile contender.
1782153 1786115 They all say five weeks isn't<br />enough time to get into shape.
1786199 1788743 Shape nothing, man.<br />They're afraid.
1788826 1790828 They know everybody<br />is gonna see this fight.
1790912 1792747 None of them's got<br />a prayer of whipping me.
1792789 1796834 They're making excuses so they don't<br />have to be the chump who gets whipped.
1796918 1799545 All I can say is I'm<br />a good promoter.
1800046 1803216 I've promoted fights<br />in every goddamn country in the world
1803299 1805468 and I've broken my ass over this one.
1805551 1807804 I don't know what else to do!
1813393 1814519 I do.
1816896 1820816 Without a ranked contender,<br />what this fight needs is a novelty.
1821274 1823735 This is the land of<br />opportunity, right?
1823819 1826238 So, Apollo Creed, on January 1st,
1826321 1829408 gives a local underdog fighter<br />an opportunity.
1830117 1834454 A snow-white underdog, and I'm gonna<br />put his face on this poster with me.
1834496 1836415 And I'll tell you why.
1836498 1838500 Because I'm sentimental.
1838834 1841545 A lot of other people in this country<br />are just as sentimental
1841628 1844464 and there's nothing they'd like<br />better than to see Apollo Creed
1844506 1847676 give a local Philadelphia boy a shot<br />at the greatest title in the world
1847717 1850053 on this country's biggest birthday.
1850137 1852264 Now that's the way I see it
1852597 1854850 and that's the way it's gonna be.
1854891 1856601 Apollo, I like it.
1857060 1858854 It's very American.
1859521 1862524 No, Jergens. It's very smart.
1887089 1889258 - What is it?<br />- I wanna check this thing out.
1889341 1893137 You said pick up two yards from Snyder<br />and a grand from Cappoli, right?
1893220 1897308 No, no. Two yards from Cappoli<br />and a grand from Snyder.
1897391 1899143 - Two yards.<br />- Write it down, okay?
1899226 1900811 Yeah, I got it.
1900895 1904273 Who's this girl you're going out with<br />tomorrow night?
1904440 1906609 - How'd you know?<br />- I know.
1906692 1909862 Don't you think I hear things? Lot<br />of canaries flying around the docks.
1909904 1912156 - I'm going out with Paulie's sister.<br />- Hey, Rocky.
1912239 1914408 - What?<br />- I hear she's retarded.
1914617 1916702 She ain't retarded.<br />She's shy, you know?
1916744 1921331 Tell you what to do. Take her to the zoo.<br />I hear retards like the zoo.
1921414 1923249 - This bum gotta say that?<br />- Who you calling a bum?
1923333 1925126 - Back it up, Buddy.<br />- I'm calling you a bum!
1925210 1928546 Relax, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood.<br />It's his prostate.
1928588 1931716 He's always in a bad mood.<br />You ought to count your blessings.
1931758 1933426 You're still a healthy person.
1933510 1935762 - I don't like your face.<br />- I don't like yours either!
1935803 1937889 - Kiss my ass!<br />- Come out here!
1937931 1940475 Relax! Relax. My ears.
1940558 1943228 Are you driving me crazy?<br />Both of you.
1943436 1945980 Look. Buddy doesn't like you.
1946523 1949359 Some guys, they just hate<br />for no reason. <i>Capisce?</i>
1949442 1951110 - Yeah.<br />- Come here.
1952612 1955949 Here's 50 bucks. You and your girl<br />Adrian, you have a nice time.
1955990 1957242 Thanks.
1958451 1960453 How'd you know her name?
1960537 1962789 You don't think I hear things?
1963540 1964916 Hey, Rock.<br />What?
1964958 1966459 - Remember what I told you?<br />- What'd you tell me?
1966501 1967502 Take her to the zoo.
1967627 1969545 Come on out of the car!
1976009 1979304 - Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?<br />- No, thanks, Shirley.
1979972 1981807 What do you think about Billy Snow?
1981848 1983058 Fouls.
1984518 1986436 How about Big Chuck Smith?
1986478 1988564 No, he's too old and dull.
1988730 1990649 Hey, that Bobby Judge,<br />he's a good boy.
1990691 1992442 No. I don't feel no<br />heat from that name.
1992484 1994653 Joe Zack's a good prospect.
1995862 1998699 Exactly what are you<br />looking for, Apollo?
1999825 2002035 This is what I'm looking for.
2002202 2004329 The Italian Stallion.
2004705 2007165 Rocky Balboa?<br />Never heard of him.
2007624 2009668 Look, it's the name, man.
2009710 2011712 The Italian Stallion.
2012671 2014339 The media will eat it up.
2014381 2017217 Who discovered America?<br />An Italian, right?
2017551 2021053 What would be better than to get<br />it on with one of his descendants?
2021137 2022638 He's a southpaw.
2022680 2024432 I don't want you messing around<br />with southpaws.
2024515 2026559 - They do everything backwards.<br />- Southpaw nothing.
2026642 2028561 I'll drop him in three.
2029687 2033441 Apollo Creed meets<br />the Italian Stallion.
2035192 2037361 Sounds like a damn monster movie.
2037528 2039697 What are you doing with that bat?
2039739 2041407 I used to be deadly at stickball.
2041490 2044368 - Your sister knows I'm coming?<br />- She's very excited.
2044702 2046829 - Look at these swollen hands.<br />- Yeah.
2046871 2050333 The joints from carrying meat<br />in and out of the freezer.
2050374 2053628 - Plays hell on the joints.<br />- Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
2053711 2055630 I don't need a doctor.<br />I need a different job.
2055713 2058132 Different job. What kind of turkey?<br />Big? Small?
2058215 2061552 Talk to Gazzo.<br />Tell him I'm a good man.
2061636 2064722 Nothing bothers me.<br />I'd make a great collector.
2064764 2066766 Busting bones don't bother me.
2066849 2069225 Don't bother you. Big turkey, right?
2069309 2072354 Gazzo's gotta give me...<br />Forget Gazzo. It's a bad job.
2072395 2073938 You got a match?
2074022 2075982 Go to him for me.<br />As a favor.
2076066 2078818 Yeah, yeah.<br />Last time I had a turkey
2078902 2082405 was when they had a two-dollar special<br />at Horn and Hardart's three years ago.
2082447 2084949 Last year, me and the<br />turtles had Spam.
2093250 2097171 - Your sister knows I'm coming?<br />- Yeah, yeah. She's very excited.
2100549 2102927 Will you forget about Gazzo?
2103594 2105096 I don't ask nobody twice.
2105137 2107098 Don't ask nobody twice.
2112603 2114563 You're sure your sister<br />knows I'm coming?
2114605 2116649 Yeah. She's very excited.
2120318 2122112 Paulie, you're late.
2123113 2124447 You call the hospital?
2124489 2127617 She calls the hospital<br />if I'm ten minutes late.
2128535 2130245 Yo, how you doing?
2131287 2133665 I told you, she's very excited.
2136292 2138628 Why didn't you tell me<br />you were bringing him here?
2138670 2140296 I'm not ready for this.
2140338 2142799 Would it make<br />a difference if you were?
2142841 2145301 - He's taking you out.<br />- No, I can't.
2146636 2149389 I want you out of<br />the kitchen right now.
2150056 2151307 I won't.
2156146 2158732 I want you out of<br />here instamatically!
2158815 2161443 I'm sick of seeing you hanging<br />around like a freaking spider.
2161484 2163653 Go out and live. Enjoy life!
2163862 2165488 I can't go!
2165572 2167490 Don't get wise with me now.
2167574 2169324 I'm tired of you being a loser.
2169366 2171577 Don't call me that, Paulie!
2171660 2174538 <i>Apollo Creed says<br />he'll be shopping for another victim</i>
2174621 2178417 <i>to fill Green's vacancy for the<br />Bicentennial championship fight...</i>
2178500 2180169 Why didn't you tell me<br />you were bringing him home?
2180252 2181545 How do you know I didn't?
2181628 2184506 I can't go, Paulie. I won't go!
2184548 2185674 Why?
2186675 2190137 Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.<br />I got a turkey in the oven.
2190846 2192848 Oh, a turkey in the oven.
2199563 2201356 Turkey in the oven.
2208405 2212159 You want the bird?<br />Go in the alley and eat the bird!
2212785 2214203 Aw, Paulie!
2215204 2218207 I want you out of here!<br />Get out of the house!
2218415 2221000 Go out and enjoy your freaking life!
2225213 2226881 You hungry, Rock?
2233554 2237225 Hey, yo, Paulie, maybe we better<br />forget all this, you know?
2237725 2240895 Forget nothing. Go ahead.<br />Tell her something funny.
2240937 2244106 Ain't nothing to talk about.<br />She's in a bad mood. I'm in a bad mood.
2244190 2246984 You can do funny things.<br />You wanna go out with my sister?
2247068 2248569 - Yeah.<br />- Well...
2252782 2254408 I don't know what to say.
2254492 2255701 Funny.
2267296 2269422 Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky.
2269840 2271466 Rocky, you know?
2272133 2273385 Listen,
2275679 2280100 I don't know what to say, 'cause I ain't<br />never talked to no door before.
2281268 2284521 What do I say to a door?<br />We better forget this.
2284938 2286022 You're doing fine.
2286106 2288441 I ain't doing fine.<br />I look like an idiot.
2288483 2290527 Keep doing what you're doing. Funny.
2290610 2292779 I know all about these things.
2292863 2294614 I feel like a jerk.
2300620 2303081 Yo, Adrian, it's Rocky again.
2303123 2307752 Listen, I know you ain't too happy<br />at this moment.
2308295 2309963 But could you do me a favor?
2310005 2312966 I ain't got nobody<br />to spend Thanksgiving with.
2313174 2316469 So, how about maybe you and I
2316553 2318388 go out together,<br />get something to eat.
2318471 2321015 Maybe laugh a little bit.<br />Who knows, you know?
2321098 2322850 Would you like to...
2324643 2327479 Would you like to, maybe,<br />you and me go out together?
2327563 2330190 What do you think?<br />Would you like to?
2335154 2337406 We're gonna have a good time.
2337781 2339950 We'll have a real good time.
2344496 2346290 Thanks for the bird.
2349919 2352838 I'm gonna turn the TV off.<br />I got a headache.
2365184 2367603 - What's your sister like to do?<br />- Ice-skate.
2367686 2369687 Adrian, come on.<br />You're letting the heat out.
2369729 2372065 Who pays the bills around here?
2377654 2380782 Listen, I don't want no<br />turkey anyway, you know?
2382367 2384369 But it was Thanksgiving.
2385203 2386329 What?
2386371 2388373 - It was Thanksgiving.<br />- Yeah, to you.
2388414 2390750 But to me it's Thursday, right?
2415108 2417777 - It looks kind of quiet.<br />- I think it's closed.
2417860 2420988 No, I think we're just early<br />or something like that.
2422406 2424241 - We're closed.<br />- What?
2424574 2427536 - I said we're closed.<br />- Yeah. Hey, listen.
2427577 2430956 I'm gonna smooth this guy out.<br />Wait here. I'll be right back.
2431164 2432965 - We could go someplace else.<br />- No, it's okay.
2433041 2437004 Are you closed to the general public,<br />or are you just closed to everybody?
2437087 2441258 It's after 6:00. It's Thanksgiving.<br />That's why there's nobody here.
2441591 2443635 Besides, you ain't<br />supposed to be in here.
2443719 2446221 So do me a favor and not stay here.
2446263 2449850 - Could you do me a favor?<br />- Come on. We're not operating.
2450101 2452937 Look. This girl here<br />ain't feeling well.
2453021 2455565 Doctors say she should go out<br />and exercise.
2455606 2457775 Ice-skating's probably<br />the best thing.
2457859 2459110 So what do you want from me?
2459193 2461070 Well, hey,<br />I want you to do me a favor.
2461112 2462739 You can see she ain't<br />feeling too good.
2462780 2465825 If you can let her on the ice<br />for a few minutes, I'd appreciate it.
2465908 2467702 Ten minutes, ten bucks.
2467785 2469953 Ten bucks?<br />How about eight bucks?
2470037 2472164 Come on. It's Thanksgiving.
2472414 2474291 All right.<br />Nine bucks, you got a deal.
2474374 2477127 You have the ice to yourself.<br />Ten bucks.
2479254 2481006 Give her the blades.
2481798 2483091 Aren't you skating?
2483133 2485135 No, I ain't skated since I was 15.
2485218 2487512 That's when I started fighting.
2487804 2490474 Skating's kind of bad for<br />the ankles, you know?
2491433 2494186 You're a pretty good<br />skater, aren't you?
2494978 2497481 Like I was saying<br />before on the way over here,
2497564 2500734 fighting used to be tops with me,<br />but no more.
2500817 2503320 All I wanted to do out of fighting<br />was prove I was no bum,
2503403 2505822 that I had the stuff<br />to make a good pro.
2505864 2508909 - You never got the chance?<br />- I ain't crying about it.
2508992 2511244 I still fight. I do it like a hobby.
2511328 2513497 The trouble is I'm a southpaw.
2513538 2516500 - What's a southpaw?<br />- A southpaw means you're left-handed.
2516583 2518959 A southpaw throws your timing off.
2519001 2521337 It throws other guys' timing off,<br />makes them look awkward.
2521420 2523005 Nobody wants to look awkward.
2523047 2526258 - You know where "southpaw" came from?<br />- Nine minutes!
2526342 2529386 A long time ago, there was this guy,<br />maybe a couple hundred years ago,
2529470 2532932 he was fighting in the...<br />I think it was around Philadelphia.
2533015 2536977 His arm... He was left-handed.<br />His arm was facing towards New Jersey.
2537019 2540898 And that's south. So naturally<br />they called him "south paw." You see?
2540981 2544276 Southpaw, South Jersey,<br />South Camden.
2544735 2546570 Southpaw.<br />You know what I mean?
2548030 2550271 Things probably worked out for<br />the best, don't you think?
2550282 2552952 Never got a chance<br />because you're left-handed, huh?
2553035 2555121 That's absolutely true, you know?
2555204 2556455 Watch out.
2558457 2561502 Ah! Ah!<br />I just dislocated my finger.
2561836 2563379 Ah! Look at that.
2564130 2565923 Wait. It ain't your fault. Look.
2566006 2568384 See? I had it... It's an old wound.
2568467 2570718 You see that? Look. See?
2570760 2572220 Nothing. It bends like that.
2572303 2575265 I originally done it... Push the button.<br />Bong. It works.
2575348 2578226 - It ain't your fault. Look.<br />- Seven minutes!
2578977 2581980 I originally done it...<br />I carry pictures of all my fights.
2582063 2584816 I originally done it<br />in the Baby Crenshaw fight.
2584899 2587944 Baby's about the size of an<br />airplane. I broke both hands on his face.
2588027 2591406 I lost that fight, but that's a<br />nice picture, don't you think?
2591447 2592824 Real nice.
2594284 2596661 Come on. You having a good time?
2597370 2599289 You can see I ain't too graceful.
2599372 2603751 I don't move well, but I can really swat.<br />I can really hit hard.
2603835 2607505 But I'm a southpaw, and nobody<br />wants to fight no southpaw.
2612719 2615471 You know how I got<br />started in fighting?
2615555 2616556 No.
2617432 2619349 Am I talking too loud?
2619641 2621226 Three minutes!
2621268 2625856 My father, he's a...<br />My old man, he was never too smart.
2625939 2628059 He says to me, "You weren't<br />born with much of a brain,
2628108 2630611 "so you better start<br />using your body."
2630694 2632613 So I become a fighter.
2633280 2635032 You know what I mean?
2635115 2636950 Why you laughing?
2638285 2641205 My mother, she said<br />the opposite thing.
2641288 2643540 What did she say the opposite?
2644166 2646460 She said, "You weren't<br />born with much of a body,
2646543 2648295 "so you better develop your brain."
2648337 2651131 - Did she say that?<br />- Yo, time!
2652424 2655302 - Can I ask you a question?<br />- Absolutely.
2656553 2659973 - Why do you wanna fight?<br />- 'Cause I can't sing or dance.
2660015 2661016 Hey, yo.
2661642 2663352 Don't fall!
2664603 2667022 That was terrific.<br />I'm pretty good at this.
2667105 2668357 You like the way I skate?
2668440 2671484 Last fight I had, I had with<br />this guy named Spider Rico.
2671567 2674278 He busted my head up there.<br />You see that scar?
2674362 2677365 I'll tell you,<br />things get pretty rough in the ring.
2686832 2689794 You know,<br />some people are very shy by nature.
2690711 2692088 I suppose.
2695007 2697885 I say you're very shy<br />by nature, you know?
2699136 2700513 I suppose.
2703182 2704934 The bum from the dark.
2705017 2706686 Get a job, you bum!
2707520 2710398 Some people think<br />that being shy is a disease,
2710481 2712441 but it don't bother me none.
2712525 2714443 Don't bother me either.
2715778 2717905 So Why'd I bother bringing it up?
2717989 2720156 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.
2721408 2723451 I think we make<br />a sharp couple of coconuts.
2723535 2726371 I'm dumb and you're shy.<br />What do you think?
2728623 2732210 I don't understand<br />why anybody would wanna be a fighter.
2732544 2737841 You gotta be a moron to wanna<br />be a fighter, you know what I mean?
2738383 2741886 It's a racket where you're<br />almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
2741928 2745390 - I don't think you're a bum.<br />- I'm at least half a bum.
2745598 2747767 But I'll tell you something.
2748643 2751229 Worst thing about fighting<br />is the morning after.
2751271 2752689 - You know?<br />- Morning after.
2752731 2754649 Yeah, the morning after a fight,
2754733 2757277 you're like a large wound,<br />you know what I mean?
2757360 2759404 Sometimes I got pains all over me.
2759487 2763199 I feel like calling a taxi to take me<br />from the bed into the bathroom.
2763241 2765160 Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt.
2765243 2768121 Your face is busted up.<br />Your hands are swollen.
2768204 2771290 Look at this face. Sixty-four fights.<br />Look at that nose.
2771373 2774126 You see that nose?<br />That nose ain't never been broken.
2774209 2776545 I had guys busting on it.
2776587 2779673 I had guys chewing on it,<br />twisting and punching it.
2779757 2781342 I mean, whack, boom.
2781425 2783927 These guys are hitting my nose<br />all the time.
2784011 2785971 Never broke it.<br />I'm very proud of that.
2786055 2787639 That's rare.
2787723 2790768 - Why do you do it if it hurts?<br />- Why you think?
2792186 2794813 'Cause you can't sing and dance?
2795105 2797608 Yeah, something like that.
2797691 2799818 Hey, you wanna come inside?
2802154 2803405 No, I gotta go.
2803447 2805449 Hey, come on.<br />I got some animals.
2805532 2807951 I got these very rare<br />animals inside.
2807993 2809620 Come on in.
2809661 2811121 No, I gotta go.
2811205 2814041 I gotta go, too,<br />to the bathroom. Come on.
2814625 2815793 Come on.
2815834 2817628 No, I gotta go.
2817670 2821340 Look at this face.<br />Is that a face you could trust or what?
2821632 2825803 Is it? They ought to stick this face<br />on a stamp. What do you think?
2826387 2827971 Come on in.
2833560 2834978 Yo, come on.
2855707 2856917 Click.
2862548 2864341 Yo, Adrian, you hungry?
2864425 2865801 No.
2865843 2867553 I got some things in there.
2867636 2870513 If you like sodas,<br />doughnuts or something.
2870680 2872849 Got a couple cupcakes.<br />Huh?
2873057 2874142 No?
2874475 2877019 I got some chocolate in there. No?
2885695 2887613 Hot in here, you know?
2889699 2891826 I could go for some music.
2897457 2898875 Yo, Adrian.
2899292 2902128 These are the exotic animals<br />I was telling you about.
2902211 2904338 These are my friends, Cuff and Link.
2904380 2907216 - I sold them to you.<br />- I know you sold them to me.
2907258 2909760 Remember you were working<br />at that pet shop?
2909844 2913306 First day you was there, and I came in<br />and bought both these animals?
2913389 2914515 I remember that.
2914557 2918311 I bought this bowl<br />and the animals themselves.
2918394 2920979 Some food, the marbles that<br />go on the bottom there.
2921062 2923023 Remember that mountain?
2923064 2927277 I had to get rid of that mountain.<br />They kept fall over and flipping.
2930739 2933575 Why don't you come over here<br />and sit down?
2935744 2938121 It's a nice couch. I don't know.
2940290 2943418 There's big bugs in there.<br />It's safer over here.
2945962 2947756 You wanna sit down?
2954429 2955972 These your parents?
2956056 2958308 Yeah, that's both of them there.
2958391 2961061 - Is this you?<br />- Yeah. I was eight years old.
2961102 2964272 That's the Italian Stallion<br />when he was a baby.
2966399 2969610 Come on over.<br />Make yourself comfortable. Relax.
2975074 2976367 Do you have a phone?
2976450 2978327 No, I had it pulled.
2978410 2980246 'Cause people calling all the time,
2980287 2983040 and who needs the aggravation, right?
2983123 2984625 Interruptions.
2985000 2986752 Who'd you wanna call?
2986794 2989547 I wanna let my brother<br />know where I am.
2990339 2991465 Why?
2993133 2994760 I think he might be worried.
2994802 2997930 I'll call your brother,<br />if that's the problem.
3000391 3002643 Yo, Paulie!<br />Your sister's with me!
3002726 3005354 I'll call you back later!<br />See you!
3011986 3014280 You don't like the room, do you?
3014321 3017324 - It's fine.<br />- It's only temporary.
3017992 3019492 It's not that.
3024414 3027500 What's the problem?<br />You don't like me?
3027542 3029752 You don't like the turtles?<br />What's the problem?
3029836 3032589 - I don't think I belong here.<br />- It's okay.
3035383 3037176 I don't belong here.
3037844 3041139 Well, you know, it's okay,<br />'cause you're my guest.
3042265 3045268 I don't know you well enough.
3045351 3048688 I've never been<br />in a man's apartment alone.
3050523 3053359 Well, they're all<br />the same, you know?
3058531 3061075 I'm not sure I know you well enough.
3062452 3064495 I don't feel comfortable.
3064704 3067540 Yo, Adrian,<br />I ain't so comfortable either.
3069958 3071501 I should go.
3071543 3073879 Don't go, please. Don't go.
3075922 3077215 Don't go.
3080802 3082429 Do me a favor.
3082512 3083722 What?
3083805 3085724 Take off these glasses.
3089394 3091688 You have nice eyes, you know?
3093523 3095317 Do me another favor?
3096318 3098695 Why don't you take off that hat?
3104993 3107245 I always knew you was pretty.
3108747 3111416 - Don't tease me.<br />- I'm not teasing you.
3114753 3116588 I ain't teasing you.
3117631 3120257 I just wanna...<br />I wanna kiss you.
3122927 3125930 You don't have to kiss me back<br />if you don't wanna,
3126013 3127848 but I wanna kiss you.
3200171 3203299 - Heard you had a fight coming up.<br />- Next month.
3203340 3205134 January 27, right?
3205176 3207178 That's good. Come down to the gym.
3207219 3209513 We'll get you in shape.<br />How's your weight?
3209597 3212475 - 175.<br />- Hey, Rock. How you doing?
3212516 3214727 Mick was looking for<br />you up there, man.
3214810 3217021 - For me? You're sure?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
3217104 3219230 He's looking for you.<br />Get up there and see him.
3219314 3221733 - He wanted me?<br />- Yeah. Your name's Rock, right?
3221816 3223735 - Yeah.<br />- All right. Go on, babe.
3238041 3239876 You got something for me?
3239959 3242796 Yeah, there was some guy<br />from Miles Jergens looking for you.
3242879 3246382 They need sparring partners<br />for Apollo Creed. There's the card.
3246424 3248134 - When was he here?<br />- About an hour ago.
3248218 3251513 They're probably looking<br />for sparring partners for Creed.
3251554 3254057 I said that before, you dumb Dago!
3255558 3258770 I been coming here for six years, and<br />six years you been sticking it to me.
3258853 3261397 - How come?<br />- You don't wanna know!
3261439 3263233 Yeah, I wanna know how come.
3263274 3265318 - You wanna know?<br />- I wanna know now!
3265401 3267445 Okay, I'm gonna tell you!
3267529 3271573 You had the talent to become<br />a good fighter, and instead of that,
3271657 3275786 you became a leg breaker<br />for some cheap, second-rate loan shark!
3276745 3277913 It's a living.
3277955 3279790 It's a waste of life!
3298392 3300185 Yes. May I help you?
3305440 3307985 Oh, you must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.
3308068 3310946 Mr. Jergens's expecting you.<br />Just a moment.
3316076 3318495 Mr. Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.
3319036 3320162 Fine.
3320955 3323457 - Please go in, Mr. Balboa.<br />- Can I have that?
3323499 3325960 - Oh, certainly.<br />- Thanks.
3330715 3332133 Mr. Balboa.
3332842 3334635 How are you?<br />George Jergens.
3334719 3336345 Take a chair, please.
3336429 3337638 Thanks.
3339473 3340892 Mr. Balboa.
3341475 3343311 Call me Rocky.
3343394 3345479 Rocky, you got any representation?
3345521 3347023 You have a manager?
3347106 3348524 No, just me.
3350151 3353988 Rocky, I've got a proposition<br />I'd like to make to you.
3354405 3357575 - About sparring?<br />- Beg your pardon?
3357658 3362163 I know you're looking for sparring<br />partners, and I'm very available.
3362330 3364165 - I'm sure you are.<br />- Absolutely.
3364248 3365750 Sparring with the champ<br />would be an honor,
3365833 3367084 and you know what, Mr. Jergens?
3367168 3369044 - What?<br />- I wouldn't take no cheap shots.
3369127 3371296 I'd really be a good<br />sparring partner.
3371338 3373673 You don't understand me, Rocky.
3374090 3376009 My proposition's this.
3376843 3379220 Would you be interested<br />in fighting Apollo Creed
3379304 3382015 for the world heavyweight<br />championship?
3386603 3387687 No.
3387854 3389397 Listen, Rocky.
3390357 3392359 Apollo's seen you fight.
3393151 3394778 He likes you.
3394861 3396613 He wants to fight you.
3396696 3398490 Well, it's just that, you see,
3398531 3401701 I fight in clubs, you know,<br />and I'm really a ham-and-egger.
3401785 3403662 This guy, he's the best, and
3403703 3407374 it wouldn't be such a good fight,<br />but thank you very much.
3407874 3409292 I appreciate it.
3409376 3413713 Rocky, do you believe that America<br />is the land of opportunity?
3415215 3416216 Yeah.
3417092 3418801 Apollo Creed does,
3419176 3421136 and he's gonna prove<br />it to the whole world
3421220 3423931 by giving an unknown<br />a shot at the title.
3424431 3426433 And that unknown is you.
3427184 3429019 He picked you, Rocky.
3430229 3432481 It's the chance of a lifetime.
3433607 3435567 You can't pass it by.
3436735 3437736 What do you say?
3443242 3445411 <i>All right, fellas.<br />That's enough pictures.</i>
3445494 3447371 <i>We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.</i>
3447413 3449957 <i>Apollo, how do you like<br />the City of Brotherly Love?</i>
3450040 3453460 <i>Well, just being in<br />Philadelphia makes me feel patriotic.</i>
3453544 3456255 <i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city<br />coming up to me on the street,</i>
3456338 3457548 <i>wishing me the best.</i>
3457589 3460384 <i>I love my Philadelphia brothers,<br />and I'm proud to be an American.</i>
3460426 3461969 <i>Apollo? Champ?</i>
3462052 3465931 <i>Why did you agree to fight a man<br />who has virtually no chance of winning?</i>
3465973 3468267 <i>If history proves one thing,</i>
3468350 3472103 <i>American history proves that</i><br /><i>everybody's got</i> a <i>chance to win.</i>
3472186 3475314 <i>Didn't you guys ever hear<br />of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>
3475398 3476941 <i>Apollo?</i>
3476983 3479569 <i>It is a coincidence<br />that you're fighting a white man</i>
3479610 3481650 <i>on the most celebrated day<br />in the country's history?</i>
3481654 3484907 <i>I don't know. Is it a coincidence<br />that he's fighting a black man</i>
3484949 3487285 <i>on the most celebrated day<br />in the country's history?</i>
3487368 3489370 <i>- Right on, Apollo!<br />- Tell the truth, brother!</i>
3489454 3492054 <i>Listen, Apollo. How<br />do you feel about your challenger?</i>
3492123 3494876 <i>How do I feel about him?<br />Come here, Rock.</i>
3495334 3496669 <i>My main man.</i>
3496753 3499464 <i>- Rocky, ain't you Italian?<br />- Yeah, I'm Italian.</i>
3499505 3501257 <i>Now what does that mean?</i>
3501299 3504177 <i>That means, if he can't fight,<br />I'll bet he can cook.</i>
3505887 3508473 Do me a favor. His lungs, punch out.
3508514 3509974 Paulie.
3510016 3513269 <i>Rocky, how do you expect<br />to fight Apollo Creed?</i>
3513811 3516022 <i>Oh, jeez, you know,<br />Creed's the best.</i>
3516105 3517815 <i>I guess I'll have to do<br />the best I can.</i>
3517857 3520525 <i>Tell me, Rocky, just between us,</i>
3520609 3523653 <i>where did you get<br />the name "Italian Stallion"?</i>
3523737 3528158 <i>Oh, I invented that about eight<br />years ago when I was eating dinner.</i>
3528241 3533038 <i>Rocky, now your payday<br />will be $150, 000.</i>
3533163 3534581 <i>Any comment?</i>
3536833 3539711 <i>- You got no comment, Rocky, right?<br />- No.</i>
3539795 3541254 <i>- Thank you, Rocky.<br />- Wait a minute.</i>
3541338 3544257 <i>I just wanna say hi to<br />my girlfriend, okay?</i>
3544341 3546468 <i>Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky.</i>
3547552 3550347 <i>You believe all this?<br />Microphones and all that stuff.</i>
3550388 3551515 You didn't.
3551599 3553935 <i>- Thank you, Rocky.<br />- Who you pushing, man?</i>
3554018 3556354 <i>- Smack you in the mouth!<br />- Thank you, Rocky.</i>
3556437 3558356 Don't it matter he making<br />you out a fool?
3558397 3560024 I'd break his lips.
3560149 3563736 - He's taking cheap shots.<br />- Don't bother me none.
3563820 3568657 Yo, Rocky, I guess you'll be looking<br />for people to help you out.
3568698 3570033 Help what?
3570075 3571326 You know,
3571368 3573328 keep you living the clean life.
3573370 3575664 I do okay, you know.
3575705 3577707 You need someone<br />to help with the exercise
3577749 3581628 and someone standing by with a towel<br />or running errands?
3581711 3584464 Hey, yo, Paulie,<br />who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.
3584548 3587134 So I just think I'm gonna<br />train myself, you know?
3587217 3589386 Without such good people around<br />to help you,
3589427 3591888 you don't have such a good chance.
3592055 3594599 Einstein flunked out<br />of school twice.
3594933 3596184 That so?
3596351 3600230 Yeah. Beethoven was deaf.<br />Helen Keller was blind.
3600772 3603233 I think Rocky's got a good chance.
3608905 3611032 Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?
3611074 3614870 You looking to do a good deed?<br />Keep out of my freaking life!
3615745 3617622 - What'd I do?<br />- Nothing.
3617706 3619290 Did I say something wrong?
3619373 3621125 You didn't say nothing.<br />It's all right.
3621208 3623252 That's right!<br />You didn't say nothing!
3623294 3624879 Nothing at all!
3626881 3628257 I gotta go.
3629425 3631802 Where are the freaking pretzels?
3634889 3636807 I'd like to have a pretzel.
3636891 3639018 Hey, we ain't got any beer?
3639894 3643063 I thought you were supposed to<br />pick up some beer!
3650905 3653490 How'd you like hearing your name<br />on TV tonight?
3655284 3656785 I was shocked.
3656827 3658287 Why'd you do that?
3658329 3660122 You're putting me on, right?
3660164 3661582 Absolutely.
3662333 3665127 - What time should I expect you?<br />- About 7:00.
3665169 3667129 - Okay.<br />- Hey.
3684646 3688107 You know how I said<br />that stuff on TV didn't bother me?
3688483 3689484 Yeah.
3692111 3693363 It did.
3703998 3707627 Listen, the reason I brought<br />you here is because
3707669 3710004 I wanna know if you got any money<br />for training expenses.
3710088 3711839 I got a few dollars.
3711923 3714175 A few bucks? Here.<br />Put this in your glove.
3714259 3717345 - What's this?<br />- $500. Don't worry about it.
3718554 3720514 You know, you ain't<br />never had any luck,
3720555 3723058 but I think this time Lady Luck<br />may be in your corner.
3723141 3726103 - What do you think?<br />- Maybe.
3726186 3728105 Thanks for the money, Tony.
3728188 3731275 It's okay. Don't worry about it.<br />I'll see you.
3731525 3733360 - Wait a minute.<br />- What?
3733402 3735529 You're in training.<br />Come on.
3743704 3745330 - Yo, Tony.<br />- What?
3746206 3748458 You gonna show up at the fight?
3748542 3749835 Ringside.
3752212 3753714 I'll see you.
3788998 3789999 Yeah.
3795588 3799091 Hello, kid. I seen your light.<br />Can I come in?
3799175 3801469 - Yeah, sure.<br />- Yeah. Good.
3801552 3803679 Hey, it's a nice place here.
3804472 3807266 Anyway, what I come<br />to tell you is that,
3808642 3811937 that what happened to<br />you is freak luck.
3811979 3813939 - Yeah, freak luck.<br />- Ain't it true?
3813981 3816525 Look at the other guys.<br />They're good fighters, right?
3816609 3819277 They're colorful.<br />They got good records.
3819361 3821696 They fight their guts<br />out for peanuts.
3821780 3825742 But you, you got<br />a shot at the title!
3825784 3828286 Freak luck is a strange thing,<br />you know?
3828328 3830872 - Sure is. Can I sit down?<br />- Yeah, sure.
3832457 3835585 - What the hell are those?<br />- Domestic turtles.
3835627 3838171 The one on the top is Cuff<br />and the other guy's Link.
3838254 3839464 The rest are marbles.
3839547 3841925 Yeah?<br />They make good soup.
3842634 3843802 Anyway.
3843885 3846805 Look, I'm here to warn you.
3846846 3851393 You gotta be very careful about this<br />shot that you got at the title.
3851476 3854270 Because, like the Bible says,
3854312 3856481 you ain't gonna get a second chance.
3856564 3858691 Yeah. All right.
3858775 3860693 You thought of that, huh?
3860777 3864197 Well, what you need is a manager.
3865156 3867242 A manager. Listen to me.
3867325 3871036 I know, because I been<br />in this racket for 50 years.
3871120 3874415 - 50 years, huh?<br />- 50 years. I've seen it all.
3874498 3877835 - All of it. You know what I done?<br />- What?
3877876 3879878 I have done it all.
3879962 3883757 You should've seen me when I knocked<br />Ginny Russell out of the ring.
3883841 3885759 Out of the goddamn ring, I tell you.
3885843 3887845 September 14, 1923,
3887928 3892307 and it was the same night that Firpo<br />knocks Dempsey out of the ring.
3892349 3894768 So who gets the publicity?<br />Figure that out.
3894852 3896770 - Dempsey.<br />- That's right. But why?
3896854 3900691 - 'Cause he was champ.<br />- No! Because he had a manager.
3900858 3902359 I had nothing.
3903735 3906238 I wanna show you something.<br />I want you to look at my face.
3906321 3909658 Look at this. I got 21<br />stitches over this left eye.
3909700 3912202 I got 34 stitches over this eye.
3912244 3915706 You know I had my<br />nose busted 17 times.
3915747 3920376 The last time<br />was in that fight with Sailor Mike.
3920419 3923380 I got that clipping here.<br />It was a good fight.
3923422 3925382 Wanna read that?
3925424 3927551 Well, it doesn't matter.
3927634 3931138 Anyway, he put this<br />vegetation on my ear.
3936643 3940564 You kind of remind me of the Rock,<br />you know that?
3940606 3942691 - You really think so?<br />- That's right.
3942733 3946153 You move like him,<br />and you got heart like he did.
3946236 3949823 Yeah, I got heart, but I ain't<br />got no locker, do I, Mick?
3953660 3955412 Anyway.
3955454 3958582 You know, when I begun<br />in this business, kid...
3960834 3964838 I wanna make a suggestion.<br />Don't drink that piss before a fight.
3964922 3967049 It's no good for you.
3967716 3969509 If you don't mind my saying.
3969592 3971802 Anyway, you know,<br />when I started in this racket,
3971886 3974096 pugs like us, we was<br />treated like dogs.
3974180 3976599 For $10, you got to<br />tear somebody's throat out.
3976682 3978935 But I never had no management.
3980311 3983314 One time, this son of a<br />bitch that I fought,
3983397 3985358 he put a nail right there.
3985441 3987777 - In his thumb.<br />- In the thumb of the glove.
3987818 3992949 He punched so many holes in my face,<br />I had spit shooting out of my cheeks.
3993533 3995326 Can you imagine that?
3995409 3998955 Anyway, when I tell you what I<br />looked like when I was in my prime.
3999038 4000790 I want you to look at something.
4000873 4003501 Look at that.<br />That's the way I looked
4004460 4006587 before these guys got at me.
4006629 4010424 That's nice. You didn't take very<br />good care of the picture, though.
4010466 4013719 Well, I never had no management.
4013803 4016013 That's the trouble,<br />but now I got all this knowledge.
4016097 4018848 I got it up here.<br />Now I wanna give it to you.
4018932 4021643 I wanna give you this knowledge.<br />I wanna take care of you.
4021685 4024938 I wanna make sure that what happened<br />to me doesn't happen to you.
4024980 4026815 You know what I mean?
4026856 4028692 Mick, the fight's set.
4028775 4031403 Listen to me.<br />I wanna be your manager.
4031486 4032862 You follow that?
4032946 4035156 Fight's set.<br />I don't need no manager.
4035240 4037617 But you can't buy<br />what I'm gonna give you.
4037659 4040078 I got pain and I got experience.
4040161 4042664 I got pain and I got experience too.
4043373 4044833 Listen, kid.
4045000 4046543 Hey, Mick.
4046626 4049254 I needed your help<br />about 10 years ago, right?
4049337 4052340 Ten years ago. You never helped me none.<br />You didn't care.
4052382 4054217 If you wanted help...
4054843 4058888 I say, if you wanted help,<br />why didn't you just ask me, kid?
4058972 4061558 I asked,<br />but you never heard nothing!
4062517 4063852 Well, I...
4067147 4068523 know I..
4068564 4070232 I'm 76 years old.
4074987 4076196 And...
4111690 4114109 Took you long enough to get here.
4114860 4117071 Took 10 years to come to my house.
4117112 4119113 You don't like my house?
4119864 4121407 My house stink?
4122575 4124577 That's right, it stinks!
4124661 4126996 I didn't<br />ask no favors from you!
4130083 4131918 Talk about your prime.
4132418 4134295 What about my prime, Mick?
4134587 4136547 At least you had a prime!
4137256 4139467 I ain't had no prime.<br />I ain't had nothing.
4139550 4142553 Legs are going, everything is going.<br />Nobody's giving me nothing.
4142595 4144806 Guy comes up, offers me a fight.<br />Big deal.
4144889 4147392 Wanna fight the fight?<br />Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.
4147433 4151062 I'm gonna go fight that big fight<br />and I'm gonna get that!
4151437 4153231 I'm gonna get that!
4154440 4156567 And you wanna be ringside and see?
4156609 4158695 Do you?<br />You wanna help me out?
4158778 4161531 Do you wanna see me<br />get my face kicked in?
4161614 4163616 Legs ain't working,<br />nothing's working.
4163658 4166119 Think I'll go and fight the champ.
4166619 4168413 Yeah, I'll fight him.
4170789 4172708 Get my face kicked in.
4173583 4176128 And you come around here.<br />You wanna move in with me?
4176211 4178463 Come on in.<br />It's a nice house!
4179005 4181800 Real nice! Come on in! It stinks!
4183093 4185095 This whole place stinks.
4185512 4187431 You wanna help me out?
4187889 4191643 Well, help me out! Come on.<br />Help me out. I'm standing here!
4251368 4254371 <i>It's only about<br />28 degrees. We'll check that forecast.</i>
4254455 4257374 <i>I feel very mischievous,<br />very weird, very...</i>
4258709 4261003 <i>I got vinyl seats in my car.</i>
4261045 4264173 <i>When I hit those seats this morning,<br />I just went, "Whoo!"</i>
4264215 4268511 <i>I figure if I'm up, everybody<br />in the Delaware Valley should be up.</i>
4268551 4269886 <i>You agree with me?</i>
4269969 4273848 <i>At three minutes past 4:00 in<br />the morning, what else you gonna do?</i>
4275350 4276518 <i>Hello?</i>
4276559 4280146 <i>Good morning, Mrs. Kramer. This<br />is Don Cabot, VINBG Philadelphia?</i>
4280230 4282440 <i>- How are you this morning?<br />- What?</i>
4282524 4286402 <i>You have a lot of nerve calling<br />me at this hour of the morning!</i>
4286487 4287780 <i>Good-bye!</i>
4301001 4303629 <i>Me and Mrs. Kramer are up,<br />and it's a good morning.</i>
4303712 4306382 <i>I tell you, I need someone<br />to snuggle with. 28 degrees.</i>
4306423 4308509 <i>It's cold out there.<br />We deserve it.</i>
4308592 4311053 <i>We've been getting away with<br />murder the last couple of weeks.</i>
4311095 4313222 <i>Our high today could be...</i>
4313264 4316141 <i>Tonight we 're back down<br />in the 20-degree range.</i>
4316225 4317768 <i>A little colder in the suburbs.</i>
4317810 4321020 <i>Tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,<br />we may hit 40.</i>
4321104 4323064 <i>But it's 28.<br />It's awfully chilly.</i>
4323106 4325859 <i>Make sure you have it bundled up<br />before you bring it out.</i>
4467999 4469249 Come on.
4470250 4472794 It stinks in here, you know?
4472877 4474713 Yeah. I know.
4476506 4478758 Did you kill all these things?
4479384 4481261 No, across the street.
4483263 4486057 It's like an animal morgue.
4486516 4488351 It's a little cold in here, ain't it?
4488435 4489561 Yeah.
4494065 4496234 Who killed all these things?
4496693 4498361 Are you crazy, Paulie?
4498445 4500697 If you don't pay Gazzo,<br />you end up on a hook.
4500780 4502949 Gazzo's a good man.<br />You know that.
4503033 4504826 Don't get excited.<br />I know that.
4504909 4508830 That's why I wanted you to talk to<br />him about me and the collecting job.
4508913 4511458 I can get me out of<br />this stinking freezer.
4511499 4515503 Why don't you do yourself a favor?<br />Keep this job. You eat better.
4516921 4517964 Moo.
4518589 4520674 Does it ever snow in here?
4521467 4525637 You and my sister,<br />how you getting along together?
4526555 4528223 How do you think?
4528807 4531393 I'm not sure, Rock.<br />What's the story?
4532394 4533812 About what?
4534021 4535689 What's happening?
4536523 4538233 You really like her?
4538317 4539985 Sure, I like her.
4542029 4544698 I don't see it.<br />What's the attraction?
4545741 4548535 I don't know.<br />Fills gaps, I guess.
4549286 4550788 What's "gaps"?
4551121 4555125 I don't know. She's got gaps.<br />I got gaps. Together we fill gaps.
4557586 4559213 You balling her?
4559671 4560672 Hey.
4561381 4564134 You don't talk dirty<br />about your sister.
4565969 4568097 Are you screwing my sister?
4570556 4574018 You see? That's why I can't<br />connect you with Gazzo.
4574102 4577438 Because you got a big mouth.<br />You just talk too much.
4578481 4581359 - It's cold in here. I'm going home.<br />- Cold in here?
4581442 4583027 It is cold in here!
4583111 4585530 It stinks in here, and you stink!
4614100 4616144 You're breaking the ribs.
4635537 4639583 If you do that to Apollo Creed,<br />they'll put us in jail for murder.
4641376 4643920 I'll see you tomorrow<br />morning, okay?
4656642 4658936 - I turned the heat up.<br />- Thanks.
4659312 4663274 Your brother's a good man,<br />but he's awful pushy, you know?
4673575 4676620 - You want me to rub you down?<br />- No, I'm just sore, okay?
4676661 4678955 - I'm gonna just sit here.<br />- You sure?
4678997 4680457 Yeah, I'm sure.
4684127 4686963 Hey, come on.<br />No fooling around, all right?
4687297 4688632 I'm tired.
4689549 4691468 Adrian, I'm serious now.
4691551 4693470 There's no fooling<br />around during training.
4693511 4695305 I wanna stay strong.
4695639 4698475 - You're not kidding.<br />- No, I ain't kidding.
4701478 4703438 - You sure?<br />- Yeah, I'm sure.
4703480 4706191 Why don't you just<br />make the meat, okay?
4708068 4710111 Okay, I'll make the meat.
4736679 4738597 - It's okay.<br />- I'm sorry.
4739640 4740641 Hey.
4771337 4774257 Underneath! Underneath!<br />Knock him out! Come on!
4774340 4776426 Hold it. Hold it, Rock!
4776509 4780555 You're driving me crazy. You're so<br />sloppy because you're off balance.
4780596 4782557 Let's try this. Take this string.
4782598 4784225 Tie it to both ankles.
4784267 4787395 - Leave about two feet of slack.<br />- I never had good footwork.
4787437 4790064 Never mind footwork.<br />Now you're all balanced.
4790106 4792608 Marciano had the same problem
4792692 4794902 and this string cured it.
4795403 4800283 If you can move and hit without<br />breaking the string, you got balance!
4800366 4802660 You become a dangerous person.
4802744 4804746 - You follow me?<br />- Looking good, Rock.
4804787 4806873 - Thanks.<br />- Let's go. That's it.
4806914 4808875 - Underneath it.<br />- Hey, Rock.
4808916 4811044 - What?<br />- How about an autograph?
4811085 4812545 Get out of here!
4812587 4815423 Don't interrupt me<br />while I'm conducting business.
4815465 4817759 Move your little chicken asses out.
4817800 4822054 Hey, listen, kid.<br />You lay off that pet shop dame.
4822429 4824806 Women weaken legs.
4826099 4828393 Yeah, but I really like<br />this girl, you know?
4828435 4830354 Then let her train you!
4832981 4834941 Okay, no more fooling around.
4835025 4836693 Okay. Now hit it.
4838362 4840614 Women weaken legs, huh?
4845285 4846912 - Yo, Rock.<br />- Yo, Rocky.
4857422 4858965 You look great.
4860092 4861927 - Really?<br />- Oh, yeah.
4862135 4864638 Terrific.<br />I mean, you could be a heartbreak.
4864679 4867474 You'll walk down the street<br />breaking hearts the way you're looking.
4867557 4868641 Very sharp.
4869225 4871310 I got another surprise for you.
4871394 4872478 What?
4873187 4875773 Butkus! Hey, Butkus.
4875815 4877775 Come here, kid.
4877817 4880194 To keep you company when you run.
4885199 4888202 Come in and meet the family.<br />The owner never come back?
4888285 4890246 Gloria says he's yours<br />if you want him.
4890329 4893040 Do I want him? What's he eat?
4893124 4895000 He eats little turtles.
4919691 4921401 What's that, Butkus?
4921484 4923570 Whose truck is this? Come on.
4925905 4928533 One call from me, you're a celebrity.
4930618 4932078 You got... Need exposure.
4932162 4934414 - Don't breathe on me.<br />- That's the big time.
4934497 4936124 Don't I know about these things?
4936207 4938376 You don't know nothing.<br />What do they want from me?
4938460 4940128 To watch you train.
4940211 4942922 What is the matter with you?<br />This is supposed to be private.
4943006 4945425 - I'm doing you a favor.<br />- You ain't doing me no favors!
4945508 4947427 You're embarrassing me<br />in front of everybody.
4947510 4949512 You'll make me look bad<br />in front of your sis...
4949554 4951890 See this cigar?<br />I'm gonna stick it in your ear.
4951931 4955059 Don't do these things to me.<br />You should've called me.
4955143 4957479 Leave a message.<br />Don't do that.
4958146 4960273 My sister really likes you.
4961566 4963818 I'm gonna kill you one<br />of these days!
4963902 4965153 Come on.
4965236 4966946 - Baby!<br />- Baby.
4967572 4971283 Here he is, the next heavyweight<br />champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!
4971366 4973285 Hello there. Rocky Balboa.
4973368 4975287 We wanna get a brief<br />interview with you.
4975370 4977247 - What about me?<br />- What about you?
4977289 4979625 - I'm in charge of the meat.<br />- Fine. Stand behind it.
4979708 4981752 Settle yourself down.<br />Relax.
4981793 4984671 What we're going to do<br />is ask you a few questions.
4984755 4987299 Just a few questions<br />about your unique training method.
4987382 4989218 Talk to the folks at home.
4989259 4991303 They really wanna know<br />how you got into this.
4991386 4994056 This isn't an everyday thing.<br />Jimmy, you guys ready?
4994097 4996266 Let's roll it.<br />Rocky, turn around here.
4996308 4998185 Just don't take no<br />cheap shots, you know?
4998268 5000229 No, I won't do that.<br />Just relax.
5000270 5003774 Today we're here with<br />heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.
5003815 5005484 The reason we're standing in this...
5005567 5008111 The meat guy's sticking his face in.
5008153 5010239 Let's try it again, Rocky.
5011073 5014117 <i>Today we 're here with<br />heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.</i>
5014201 5016787 <i>The reason we 're standing<br />in this refrigerated box</i>
5016828 5020039 <i>is that Mr. Balboa<br />has an unusual method of training.</i>
5020123 5023627 <i>In a moment, he'll demonstrate that<br />for the viewing audience at home.</i>
5023669 5027297 <i>But first, Rocky, how did you<br />come to train in an Icebox?</i>
5027923 5030717 <i>Well, my friend,<br />the guy over there,</i>
5030801 5033637 <i>he let me in one day,<br />and I hit the beef here and liked it,</i>
5033720 5037140 <i>and since I've become a challenger,<br />the owner don't mind that I come in.</i>
5037182 5041103 <i>Is this a common training method?<br />Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i>
5041144 5043146 <i>No, I think I invented it.</i>
5043188 5045941 <i>- Would you give us a demonstration?<br />- Confirm the reservation</i>
5045983 5049486 for my people at ringside,<br />and fly my barber to Philly.
5052906 5055951 How much is being channeled into<br />West Coast closed-circuit advertising?
5055993 5058328 - 300,000.<br />- Make it 450.
5058370 5060831 And send the mayor's wife<br />200 roses from me,
5060872 5063667 and make sure we get a picture of it<br />for all the newspapers.
5063709 5066795 Do you want to run the 15<br />radio spots in the Midwest?
5066837 5069463 You can spend your money better<br />in Canadian publicity.
5069505 5072258 By the way, Apollo,<br />I've got friends in Toronto
5072341 5074302 who can get you a good tax break.
5074343 5076512 George, I like your friends.
5084520 5088899 Hey, Champ. You ought to come look at<br />this boy you're gonna fight on TV.
5089567 5092778 - Looks like he means business.<br />- Yeah, I mean business too.
5092862 5095031 Shirley,<br />we got any more coffee out there?
5095072 5097700 Certainly, Mr. Creed.<br />I'll get you some right away.
5097783 5101037 After the fight,<br />I may retire and run for emperor.
5115509 5117887 <i>Diana Lewis in the meat house</i>
5117928 5120388 <i>with southpaw Rocky Balboa.</i>
5166935 5168852 And he called the reporters?
5168936 5171522 Yeah. Threw my<br />training schedule off.
5171605 5173732 Don't be mad at him.<br />He's trying to help.
5173774 5175609 Adrian, I ain't mad,
5175693 5178946 it's just that when reporters are<br />around, I get out of joint
5178987 5182282 'cause they take cheap shots,<br />and Paulie knows that.
5182616 5185703 And Paulie keeps asking me<br />for a job all the time
5185786 5188539 but he don't know nothing<br />about fighting.
5188622 5191083 Are you gonna say anything to him?
5191875 5195337 What's to say? I just don't<br />know what he wants from me.
5197631 5199842 I don't want nothing from you.
5200634 5202886 I don't want nothing from you.
5203762 5207641 This ain't no charity case.<br />Get out of my house.
5207683 5209685 It's not just your house.
5210644 5212646 You're no friend no more.
5213021 5216150 - Get out of my house, I just says.<br />- Don't talk to him like that.
5216191 5218485 Both of you get out of my house!
5220486 5222530 It's cold outside, Paulie.
5232540 5234667 I don't want you messing her
5234709 5237295 and I don't raise you<br />to go with this scum bum!
5237336 5239172 Yeah? Come on!<br />You wanna hit on me?
5239213 5243050 Come on! I'll break both your arms<br />so they don't work for you.
5245386 5246512 Stop it!
5246554 5249849 I'm not good enough to meet with Gazzo?<br />That's what I think of Gazzo!
5249932 5254520 Now you're a big shot fighter, you don't<br />even throw a crumb to your friend.
5254562 5256814 When I go and get your meat<br />every morning!
5256856 5259400 You forgot that? And then I<br />even give you my sister too!
5259484 5262111 - Only a pig would say that!<br />- I'm a pig?
5262862 5264864 A pig gets you the best?
5265698 5268867 You're such a loser!<br />I don't get married because of you!
5269242 5271369 You can't live by yourself!
5271787 5275457 I put you two together,<br />and don't you forget it!
5275540 5276917 You owe me!
5279419 5281546 - You owe me!<br />- What do I owe you?
5281630 5284049 You're supposed to be good to me!
5284132 5287677 What do I owe you, Paulie?
5287719 5289387 I treat you good!
5289429 5292849 I cook for you, I clean for you,<br />I pick up your dirty clothes!
5292891 5296228 I take care of you, Paulie!<br />I don't owe you nothing!
5296937 5299397 And you made me feel like a loser!
5300565 5302234 I'm not a loser!
5302317 5304152 - You're busted!<br />- What?
5304236 5306029 You're not a virgin!
5306446 5308740 You let a man take down your pants!
5308824 5310283 She's busted!
5313411 5315455 I can't haul meat no more!
5345901 5347695 You want a roommate?
5352658 5353993 Absolutely.
5355870 5358163 Okay, now<br />when you walk into the ring
5358247 5361000 with the number one<br />heavyweight of the world
5361083 5362751 you'll be ready, won't you?
5362793 5366255 Why? Because I waited for 50 years
5366297 5367965 to make you ready.
5368048 5370466 You'll be able to spit nails, kid!
5370550 5373177 Like the guy says,<br />you're gonna eat lightning
5373261 5375138 and you're gonna crap thunder!
5375221 5377974 You're gonna become<br />a very dangerous person.
5378057 5379350 Yo, Mickey.
5379434 5381519 Hey, how are you? Oh, Rock.
5381603 5384689 I want you to meet our cut man here.<br />Al Salvani.
5384773 5386775 - Take a look at his eye.<br />- How you doing, Al?
5386817 5389278 - That's right.<br />- It ain't bad. Seen worse.
5389320 5392156 - You ain't so bad yourself.<br />- Cover up. Things will be okay.
5392239 5393449 You cover up.
5393490 5395284 Go and take a shower.
5395326 5397786 Okay, Mick. I'll see you tomorrow.
5398829 5401916 You covered that Whitmore fight?
5401999 5404752 - That's why he won.<br />- Listen. We got a winner here.
5404835 5408881 We got a chance. He goes to the body<br />like nobody you've ever seen.
5408964 5411842 You just stand by. We're gonna win.
5418806 5421309 Hey, Rock. It's okay I talk to you?
5421893 5424646 Okay you talk to me? Sure.
5425438 5428316 I figured some angle<br />to make some money off your name.
5428358 5431027 My name? How's that?
5431194 5433863 Advertising.<br />I know about that stuff.
5435657 5438159 What do you know about advertising?
5441454 5444374 Hey, you can make money off my name,<br />make it, okay?
5444457 5446459 I'm gonna take a shower.
5447418 5449963 - Wanna help me off with these?<br />- Sure.
5545306 5547141 You're gonna kill him!
5718017 5721519 Rocky. What brings you here tonight?
5723146 5725065 Mr. Jergens, the poster's wrong.
5725607 5727275 What do you mean?
5727442 5730278 I'm wearing white pants<br />with a red stripe.
5734115 5736534 It doesn't really matter, does it?
5736618 5739454 I'm sure you're gonna give us<br />a great show.
5740497 5742540 Try to get some rest, kid.
5743375 5744751 Good night.
5836091 5837634 I can't do it.
5840721 5841805 What?
5842931 5844558 I can't beat him.
5846143 5847394 Apollo?
5848103 5849271 Yeah.
5850689 5853609 I been out there, walking<br />around, thinking.
5855527 5858781 Who am I kidding?<br />I ain't even in the guy's league.
5864161 5865996 What are we gonna do?
5877590 5879008 I don't know.
5885390 5887141 You worked so hard.
5889018 5892230 Yeah, it don't matter,<br />'cause I was nobody before.
5894565 5896150 Don't say that.
5896859 5899153 Oh, come on, Adrian. It's true.
5899237 5900738 I was nobody.
5902657 5905326 But that don't matter<br />either, you know?
5906369 5908287 'Cause I was thinking,
5909539 5912458 it really don't matter<br />if I lose this fight.
5914544 5918131 It really don't matter<br />if this guy opens my head either.
5919423 5922217 'Cause all I wanna do<br />is go the distance.
5927139 5930016 Nobody's ever gone the distance<br />with Creed,
5930851 5933103 and if I can go that distance,
5934521 5937524 and that bell rings,<br />and I'm still standing,
5942821 5946158 I'm gonna know<br />for the first time in my life, see,
5948034 5951538 that I weren't just another bum<br />from the neighborhood.
6019020 6020813 Time, kid. Let's go.
6023858 6025777 I'll wait for you here.
6028112 6030907 How about I wait here<br />and you fight, huh?
6031783 6034869 You're looking very great today,<br />you know that?
6036871 6039958 I gotta go now,<br />but don't you leave town, huh?
6041376 6043753 Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it.
6044504 6045838 Good luck.
6046631 6049926 Adrian, you don't think<br />this robe is too baggy, huh?
6050134 6051469 Good luck.
6051511 6053179 Don't leave town.
6055557 6059185 <i>I'd like you to meet<br />my colleague, Stu Nahan.</i>

6078954 6081206 <i>you can quote<br />a recent sports magazine which said,</i>
6081290 6083333 <i>it could be<br />"the caveman against the cavalier."</i>
6083417 6085335 <i>I notice a buzzing<br />in the background.</i>
6085377 6088005 <i>Could be the challenger is getting<br />ready to get into the ring.</i>
6088046 6090257 Rocky, look at my date.
6090340 6092342 - Cost me $200.<br />- $250.
6092426 6094094 I gotta go. I gotta work.
6094177 6096513 - How's the robe?<br />- A little baggy.
6096555 6099516 <i>A 50-to-1 underdog<br />living a Cinderella story,</i>
6099558 6103312 <i>and he's captured people's<br />imaginations all over the world.</i>
6107858 6109610 We love you, Rocky!
6109943 6112779 - Good luck, champ.<br />- Thanks for showing up.
6113280 6115198 <i>And his record, 44 victories.</i>
6115282 6117868 <i>He's had 38 by knockout,<br />and he's lost 20 fights.</i>
6117909 6120328 <i>Which makes me wonder,<br />can he stand it?</i>
6120370 6123040 <i>You know, the stamina and the skill<br />to last three rounds.</i>
6123123 6125083 <i>Because Las Vegas odds say no.</i>
6125167 6128003 <i>Rocky Balboa,<br />climbing into the ring now.</i>
6128712 6130213 <i>"The Italian Stallion."</i>
6130297 6134217 <i>Some meat sign on the back of his robe.<br />You seen what that was?</i>
6134259 6136303 <i>Shamrock Meat...</i>
6136386 6139556 <i>There's a lot of noise<br />coming from the background.</i>
6140057 6142726 <i>- They have spotlights.<br />- I see right back there.</i>
6142768 6146271 <i>Is that the world heavyweight<br />champion, Apollo Creed?</i>
6146355 6150400 <i>He's riding in a boat. Is he<br />supposed to be George Washington?</i>
6150442 6153737 <i>Obviously so.<br />He's got the hat on, the whole thing.</i>
6155238 6157824 <i>The world champion, Apollo Creed</i>
6157908 6160744 <i>is doing an imitation<br />of George Washington.</i>
6161703 6163413 <i>He's throwing money.</i>
6163455 6166917 <i>Remember when we were growing up,<br />we were taught about George Washington</i>
6166958 6168418 <i>throwing a dollar.</i>
6168502 6171253 <i>If you threw a dollar in those days,<br />it went a lot farther.</i>
6171295 6174048 <i>Now he's taking his...<br />Blonde wig came off.</i>
6174090 6175758 <i>The hat came off.</i>
6177093 6178511 I want you!
6179762 6182264 <i>The crowd is loving<br />every minute of it.</i>
6182306 6185393 <i>- Here is the world heavyweight champion.<br />- Apollo Creed.</i>
6185434 6186894 <i>For you around the world</i>
6186936 6189897 <i>he was dressed as George Washington,<br />the father of our country.</i>
6189939 6191357 I want you!
6194110 6197613 <i>I don't believe what I'm seeing.<br />Uncle Sam himself!</i>
6197697 6199240 I want you!
6199281 6202159 I want all of you!
6202743 6204620 He looks like a big flag.
6204662 6206747 I want you!
6207915 6210209 - Is he talking to me?<br />- He's talking to you.
6210292 6212461 - Is he talking to me?<br />- Let him talk.
6212545 6214338 I want the Stallion!
6215005 6217299 <i>He says, "I want the Stallion."</i>
6218800 6221803 <i>For you in foreign countries,<br />during World War I,</i>
6221886 6224806 <i>the picture of Uncle Sam<br />with his finger pointed like that</i>
6224848 6227308 <i>was a recruiting poster<br />for our fellows in the service,</i>
6227350 6229602 <i>the army and the navy.<br />"I want you."</i>
6229644 6231771 <i>That's what he's doing a take on.</i>
6231813 6235108 <i>He's yelling, "Creed in three."</i>
6235150 6237318 What do you think that outfit cost?
6247704 6249873 <i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>
6250582 6254461 <i>Good evening.<br />A very Happy New Year.</i>

6301715 6303383 I'll try not to.
6303425 6305844 <i>What a credit he's been<br />in his career as a fighter</i>
6305886 6308055 <i>Now he's coming over<br />to talk to the champ.</i>
6308096 6310557 - Hey, Joe.<br />- You been ducking me a long time.
6310641 6312309 No, Joe. You're next.
6312392 6314603 - You're next.<br />- You understand?

6391261 6394097 You, chump. I want you!
6394139 6397142 You've both fought in<br />Philadelphia before. You know the rules.
6397225 6400395 No low blows,<br />watch your heads, no butting.
6400478 6402230 Shake hands and come out fighting.
6402314 6403982 Put your hands up there, chump.
6404024 6406151 - Come out fighting.<br />- Come on!
6408194 6413074 <i>Rocky's just going over and<br />being calm, it looks like from here.</i>
6414200 6416119 <i>There goes the big hat.</i>
6419580 6423167 <i>I've never seen a fighter<br />that concerned about his hair.</i>
6431216 6433510 <i>There's the bell for round one.</i>
6435012 6439141 <i>The fighters come in the center of<br />the ring, looking at each other.</i>
6439183 6442686 <i>Creed, the champion,<br />zipping in those left-handed jabs.</i>
6442728 6444688 <i>Right there. Bang.</i>
6446315 6449526 <i>The champ stinging the slower<br />challenger with jabs at will.</i>
6449568 6453572 <i>In fact, it looks like Rocky<br />is blocking the blows with his face.</i>
6453656 6458035 <i>The champion doesn't look the best<br />he's ever been, but he's moving now.</i>
6458118 6462081 <i>The champion's smiling now.<br />He's toying with him.</i>
6462873 6465834 <i>Trying to give the fans<br />their money's worth.</i>
6467503 6470964 <i>He's very clearly outclassed<br />the challenger right now.</i>
6473132 6477053 <i>He's trying to make his<br />man miss like that.</i>
6478554 6481224 <i>The champ is just taunting him.</i>
6484102 6485895 <i>Creed dancing around.</i>
6487356 6489191 <i>I don't believe this!</i>
6489233 6491652 <i>The champ is down!</i>
6497783 6498993 <i>Creed is down!</i>
6499076 6501036 <i>What a surprise this is!</i>
6502204 6505541 <i>This is the first time the champion<br />has ever been knocked down.</i>
6505582 6507793 <i>The referee is giving<br />him the count.</i>
6507876 6510754 Six, seven, eight.
6510996 6514082 <i>He appears to be all right.<br />Glassy-eyed but okay.</i>
6514091 6517261 Go to the ribs!<br />Go to work, Rock!
6517344 6518886 Come on!
6520138 6523391 <i>Rocky coming back out, and he's<br />like a bull in a china closet.</i>
6523433 6526394 <i>He really wants it.<br />Apollo, left to the head.</i>
6526477 6530189 <i>The champion's coming off the floor</i>
6530273 6532358 <i>and he's trying to put him away.</i>
6532442 6533943 <i>A left, a right.</i>
6534027 6537488 <i>Combinations into the face!<br />That's the Apollo we know.</i>
6541617 6544954 <i>Now the champ is taunting Rocky<br />to come and get some more.</i>
6545038 6546664 <i>A left. Another.</i>
6547206 6548708 <i>Another left.</i>
6550126 6551961 <i>Rocky's coming back!</i>
6553421 6556299 <i>Rocky's got him on the ropes!</i>
6557133 6558634 Let's break it.
6560136 6561637 You're holding.
6561721 6563514 You're posing as a boxer.
6563598 6566684 <i>There's no way we expected<br />this kind of hitting.</i>
6574274 6577986 <i>Apollo unloading a left.<br />He's got him up against the ropes.</i>
6585744 6589831 <i>They're leading him to his corner.<br />Rocky can't find his way.</i>
6590540 6591958 I called it!
6592000 6594544 - Your nose is broke.<br />- How's it look?
6594628 6596171 It's an improvement.
6596213 6599508 Quit shucking and jiving!<br />Stick and move!
6599549 6603053 Go for the ribs.<br />Don't let that bastard breathe.
6603136 6604554 The guy's quick.
6605680 6608475 He doesn't know it's a damn show.<br />He thinks it's a damn fight.
6608517 6611228 Finish this bum, and let's go home.
6612229 6614648 Stay to the body.<br />You're doing great!
6614689 6617943 <i>Round two. Creed predicted<br />he'd win it in three.</i>
6618026 6621570 <i>Creed got knocked down in the first.<br />He came back strong.</i>
6621946 6623614 <i>He's working hard.</i>
6624031 6626784 <i>A sharp left.<br />Again, a hard right.</i>
6626867 6629370 <i>Now coming in.<br />He's knocked him into the corner again.</i>
6629411 6631956 <i>The champion's got him<br />backed into the corner.</i>
6632039 6635960 <i>Pummeling him left and right,<br />his head bouncing against the ropes.</i>
6636836 6639880 <i>Balboa's taking<br />a tremendous beating here.</i>
6639964 6643551 <i>Battering him like a punching bag.<br />What's keeping him up?</i>
6645886 6647388 Can't you fight?
6647429 6650724 Stop clowning around<br />and give the people something!
6651392 6653727 <i>- Come on!<br />- He says he wants more!</i>
6653769 6656564 <i>He wants more. You folks<br />watching television around the world</i>
6656647 6658732 <i>you're watching a battle.</i>
6663487 6666782 <i>Balboa trying to fight back.<br />Oh, he tagged the champ!</i>
6666866 6670410 <i>The champion is trying to get out<br />of there, but he can't do it.</i>
6670451 6674372 <i>He is being barraged with lefts<br />and rights to the head and body.</i>
6674414 6677750 <i>Balboa is tagging the champion<br />right on the kisser!</i>
6678918 6682130 <i>The referee steps in.<br />They're ready to keep going.</i>
6682547 6684382 Back to your corners!
6685008 6686926 Come on, Creed!
6687677 6689929 <i>This is gonna be a tough one.</i>
6744524 6746902 <i>- Back with a left!<br />- He got tagged!</i>
6748487 6751073 <i>The referee's wiping<br />off the gloves.</i>
6756286 6758622 <i>Hard left and right<br />combination!</i>
6758664 6761625 <i>- What is keeping him up, Bill?<br />- I don't know.</i>
6763585 6766838 <i>He can't even get his gloves up<br />to protect himself.</i>
6774303 6776347 Down! Stay down!
6776430 6778766 <i>Apollo has his arms in the air!</i>
6789819 6790945 Five.
6792196 6793322 Six.
6793864 6795074 Seven.
6795157 6796367 Eight.
6796742 6797868 Nine.
6804709 6806002 Come on!
6807253 6809255 <i>Apollo can't believe it.</i>
6826062 6829232 <i>The champion got a left<br />to his right ribs.</i>
6829607 6831860 <i>This has been a tremendous...</i>
6837615 6838783 Okay, champ?
6838867 6840201 Yeah, I'm okay.
6840243 6842912 I may have broke my ribs.
6842954 6845415 I can't see nothing.<br />Gotta open my eye.
6845498 6847417 - Cut me.<br />- Don't wanna do it.
6847500 6850045 - Go ahead. Cut me.<br />- Okay.
6850086 6851629 Try it. Cut it.
6852089 6853966 Creed! Creed!
6855926 6857178 Oh, God.
6857261 6860056 You're bleeding inside.<br />I'm gonna stop the fight.
6860097 6863434 You ain't stopping nothing, man.
6863601 6866103 You stop this fight, I'll kill you!
6867438 6869606 - I'm going.<br />- If you wanna go.
6870857 6873193 You gotta give it all!
6873276 6875236 You gotta get him!
6880700 6882619 <i>The 15th and final round.</i>
6882702 6885747 Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
6891586 6894214 <i>They look like they've been in a war.</i>
6901805 6905225 <i>A hard right.<br />The champion really tagged him.</i>
6905308 6909270 <i>Apollo clearly protecting<br />his right side, his ribs.</i>
6912649 6914484 <i>Body punches!</i>
6914526 6917987 <i>Hard lefts and rights. Look at the<br />blood coming out of his mouth!</i>
6918029 6920155 <i>He's spitting up blood now.</i>
6923659 6926161 <i>A tremendous right hand by Rocky.</i>
6926203 6927621 Go for it, Rock!
6927663 6930666 <i>- Listen to this crowd!<br />- Right to the ribs.</i>
6930749 6933085 <i>Another to the ribs.<br />That left hand again.</i>
6933168 6936422 <i>Right to the jaw!<br />He's got him up against the ropes!</i>
6936505 6938590 <i>Apollo the champ...</i>
6942052 6944805 Ain't gonna be no rematch.
6945431 6946974 Don't want one.
6957484 6960446 Rocky, you went the distance,<br />15 rounds. How do you feel?
6960529 6963031 - All right.<br />- What were you thinking about...
