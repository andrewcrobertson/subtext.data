1290907 1292242 Like flying candy?
1292309 1293810 Hey, bird, you wanna fly me home?
1293877 1296214 You need somebody to walk you home?
1296281 1298350 No. Hmm? No?
1298417 1299885 It's a cold night.
1299951 1301488 You know, if I was you and got the money,
1301555 1302990 I would take a cab or something.
1303057 1304458 Too many creeps around here, you know?
1305526 1307029 Every other block, there's a creep.
1308364 1309965 You can always tell a creep.
1312569 1314372 All right. Listen. I'm gonna go now, okay?
1314439 1316040 I'll see you later, all right?
1316107 1317942 None of you guys get up.
1318009 1319913 I know you had a hard day in the cage.

1411201 1412969 Sometimes she gets me so crazy,
1413036 1414705 I could split her head with a razor.
1414772 1416141 Oh, don't get mental, man, you know?
1416208 1417609 Well, you caught me in a bad mood.
1417676 1419044 You're always in a bad mood.

1597082 1598516 there was only one girl in the whole neighborhood who talked like that.
1598583 1599617 You know what I mean?
1599684 1600954 That was it. Just one.

1613304 1614805 but you see, none of the guys
1614872 1616307 ever took her serious, you see?
1616373 1618042 They never took her out for any serious date.
1618109 1619612 Why? 'Cause that's the way guys are.
1619679 1620747 They laugh when you talk dirty.
1620813 1622515 They think you're cute.
1622582 1623716 After a while, you get a reputation. That's it.

1742642 1744210 Damn!
1744278 1746381 Of course, we can cancel the fight indefinitely
1746447 1748082 if you're set on fighting Green.
1748149 1750452 Hey, it ain't just Green.
1750519 1752923 What about all the time Apollo has invested?
1752989 1754658 I believe we can find a solution.
1754724 1756294 Solution nothing.
1756360 1757863 Now you better find me another ranked contender
1757930 1759364 and I mean in a flash, Jergens.
1759431 1761566 MAN: Don't play games with my client.
1761633 1763837 Apollo's already done a million dollars' worth of publicity,
1763904 1766273 has made contractual obligations with 20 different organizations.
1766340 1767508 He's not going to be embarrassed!
1768611 1770513 I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.
1770579 1772581 Ernie's fighting in France that same week.
1772648 1774652 Then get me Buddy Shaw. Hell, he's ranked fifth.
1774719 1777522 Went to California and gained 50 pounds.
1778723 1780259 I got ahold of every worthwhile contender
1780326 1782295 and they all say the same thing.
1782362 1784264 Five weeks just isn't enough time to get into shape.
1784331 1786868 Shape nothing, man. They're afraid.
1786935 1789037 Hell, they know everybody in the world is gonna see this fight.
1789104 1791006 None of them's got a prayer of whipping me.
1791073 1793077 So they're making excuses so they don't have to be the chump
1793143 1795112 to get whipped in front of the whole civilized world.
1795179 1798082 All I can say is I'm a good promoter.
1798148 1801387 I've promoted fights in every goddamn country in the world
1801454 1803556 and I've broken my ass over this one.
1803622 1805793 But I don't know what the hell else to do!
1808863 1810131 (SIGHING)
1811601 1812569 I do.
1815105 1816641 Without a ranked contender,
1816708 1818577 what this fight is gonna need is a novelty.
1819778 1822080 This is the land of opportunity, right?
1822147 1824451 So, Apollo Creed, on January 1st,
1824518 1828256 gives a local underdog fighter an opportunity.
1828323 1831727 A snow-white underdog, and I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me.
1832461 1834398 And I'll tell you why.
1834464 1836100 Because I'm sentimental.
1837802 1839537 A lot of other people in this country are just as sentimental
1839604 1841041 and there's nothing they'd like better than
1841107 1842442 to see Apollo Creed
1842509 1844210 give a local Philadelphia boy
1844277 1845678 a shot at the greatest title in the world
1845745 1847482 on this country's biggest birthday.
1848316 1849618 Now that's the way I see it
1851053 1852956 and that's the way it's gonna be.
1853023 1854658 Apollo, I like it.
1855292 1856760 It's very American.
1857761 1859265 No, Jergens.
1859331 1861100 It's very smart.

1978289 1979925 What do you think about Billy Snow?
1979992 1980993 Fouls.
1982661 1984465 How about, uh, Big Chuck Smith? Yeah.
1984532 1986734 No, he's too old and dull.
1986801 1988703 Hey, that Bobby Judge, he's a good boy.
1988769 1990473 No. I don't feel no heat from that name.
1990540 1992742 Joe Zack's a good prospect.
1993843 1996615 Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
1998116 2000252 This is what I'm looking for.
2000318 2001886 The Italian Stallion.
2002823 2005292 Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.
2006126 2007561 Look, it's the name, man.
2007628 2009898 The Italian Stallion.
2010699 2012401 The media will eat it up.
2012468 2014003 Now who discovered America?
2014070 2016107 An Italian, right?
2016173 2018676 What would be better than to get it on with one of his descendants?
2019310 2021014 He's a southpaw.
2021080 2022882 I don't want you messing around with southpaws.
2022949 2024584 They do everything backwards. Southpaw nothing.
2024651 2026354 I'll drop him in three.
2027789 2031660 Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.
2032094 2033463 (LAUGHS)
2033530 2035632 Sounds like a damn monster movie.
2035699 2037734 Hey, what are you doing with that bat, huh?
2037801 2039571 I used to be deadly at stickball.
2039638 2041240 You sure your sister knows I'm coming?
2041307 2043108 PAULIE: She's very excited.
2043175 2043909 Look at these swollen hands.
2043976 2046047 Yeah.
2046113 2048416 The joints from walking and carrying meat in and out of the freezer.
2048482 2050252 Plays hell on the joints.
2050320 2052088 Maybe you ought to see a doctor. What do you think?
2052155 2053823 I don't need a doctor. I need a different job.
2053890 2055525 Yeah, different job. What kind of turkey?
2055591 2057028 You have a big turkey or small turkey?
2057095 2059564 Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a good man.
2059631 2061333 Nothing bothers me.
2061399 2062769 I'd make a great collector.
2062836 2064838 Busting bones don't bother me.
2064905 2067474 Don't bother you. Big turkey, right? Huh?
2067541 2069378 Hey, Gazzo's gotta give me... Forget Gazzo. It's a bad job.
2069445 2070779 You know what I mean?
2070846 2072748 You got a match? You got a match?
2072815 2074518 Go to him for me. As a favor. Give me a match.
2074585 2076921 Yeah, yeah. You know, last time I had a turkey
2076987 2078723 was when they had a two-dollar special
2078789 2080860 at Horn and Hardart's about three years ago.
2080927 2083062 Last year, me and the turtles had Spam. What do you think?

2098784 2100919 Hey, will you forget about Gazzo, huh?
2101720 2103288 I don't ask nobody twice.

2138736 2140440 PAULIE: Would it make a difference if you were?
2140506 2142308 He's a friend and now he's taking you out.

2252521 2253889 Funny.
2265571 2267375 Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky.
2268209 2269377 Rocky, you know?
2270311 2271346 Listen, uh,
2273817 2277687 I don't know what to say, 'cause I ain't never talked to no door before, you know?
2279625 2281126 I mean, what do I say to a door?
2281193 2282628 Hey, listen, I think we should forget this.
2282694 2284198 Come on, you're doing fine.
2284264 2286467 I ain't doing fine. I look like an idiot.
2286533 2288769 Keep doing what you're doing. Funny.
2288836 2290806 I know all about these things.
2290873 2292708 I feel like a jerk.
2298916 2301285 Yo, Adrian, you know, it's Rocky again, you know?
2301352 2303156 Listen, uh,
2303223 2305725 I know you ain't too happy at this moment, you know?
2306693 2308563 But could you do me a favor?
2308630 2311166 I ain't got nobody to spend Thanksgiving with, you know?
2311233 2314838 So, uh, how about maybe you and I
2314905 2316840 maybe we go out together, get something to eat.
2316907 2319343 I don't know. Maybe laugh a little bit. Who knows, you know?
2319410 2320980 Would you like to, uh...
2323049 2324684 I don't know. Would you like to, maybe, uh...
2324750 2326019 You know, you and me go out together?
2326087 2327455 What do you think? Would you like to?
2328589 2330158 (DOOR UNLOCKING)
2333496 2335165 We're gonna have a good time.
2336332 2337734 We'll have a real good time, you know?
2342674 2344244 Thanks for the bird.
2348115 2351053 I'm gonna turn the TV off. I got a headache.
2363536 2364604 What's your sister like to do?
2364671 2366339 Ice-skate.
2366406 2367908 Adrian, come on. You're letting the heat out.
2367975 2369778 Who pays the bills around here?
2375919 2378555 Listen, uh, I don't want no turkey anyway, you know?
2380659 2382194 But it was Thanksgiving.
2383462 2384563 It was what?
2384630 2386100 It was Thanksgiving.
2386167 2388436 Yeah, to you. But to me it's Thursday, right?
2413302 2414703 Yo, it looks kind of quiet, you know?
2414770 2416140 I think it's closed.
2416207 2417642 No, I think maybe we're just early
2417708 2418910 or something like that, you know?
2419477 2420578 Yo! Yo!
2420645 2421546 We're closed.
2421612 2422715 What?
2422782 2423983 I said we're closed.
2424050 2425852 Yeah. Hey, listen.
2425919 2427888 I'm gonna smooth this guy out here.
2427955 2429858 So just wait here for a few minutes. I'll be right back, okay?
2429925 2431660 We could go someplace else. No, it's okay. It's okay.
2431726 2433830 Hey, listen, are you closed to the general public,
2433896 2435766 or are you just closed to everybody? You know what I mean?
2435833 2437901 Hey, look. It's after 6:00. It's Thanksgiving.
2437968 2439904 That's why there's nobody here.
2439972 2441941 And besides, you ain't supposed to be in here.
2442007 2444543 So do me a favor and not stay here, huh?
2444610 2446013 Could you do me a favor?
2446080 2447548 Hey, come on. We're not operating.
2448950 2451152 Look. This girl here ain't feeling well.
2451219 2452689 You know, doctors say she should go out
2452755 2454691 and exercise once in a while.
2454757 2456326 Ice-skating's probably the best thing. You know what I mean?
2456392 2458029 Yeah. So what do you want from me?
2458096 2459564 Well, hey, I want you to do me a favor.
2459631 2461366 You can see she ain't feeling too good.
2461433 2462634 If you can let her on the ice, I'd appreciate it,
2462701 2464171 only for a few minutes.
2464238 2466073 Ten minutes, ten bucks.
2466139 2468075 Ten bucks? How about eight? Eight bucks?
2468141 2470579 Come on. It's Thanksgiving.
2470646 2472448 All right. Nine bucks, you got a deal.
2472514 2474917 You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.
2477321 2478689 Give her the blades. All right.
2479957 2481325 Aren't you skating?
2481392 2483429 No, I ain't skated since I was 15.
2483496 2486132 That's when I started fighting, when I was 15.
2486199 2487801 Skating's kind of bad for the ankles, you know?
2487868 2489571 Yeah.
2489638 2491640 You're a pretty good skater, aren't you? (CHUCKLES)
2493441 2495712 You know, like I was saying before on the way over here,
2495779 2497147 you know, fighting used to be tops with me,
2497214 2499016 but no more, you know?
2499082 2501620 See, all I wanted to do out of fighting was prove I was no bum,
2501687 2503989 that I had the stuff to make a good pro, you know?
2504056 2505859 You never got the chance?
2505927 2507995 Oh, hey, you know, I ain't crying about it 'cause I still fight.
2508062 2509864 I kinda do it like a hobby.
2509931 2511699 See, I tell you what the trouble is I'm a southpaw.
2511767 2513236 What's a southpaw?
2513303 2515138 Oh, a southpaw means you're left-handed.
2515204 2517206 A southpaw throws your timing off, you see?
2517273 2519511 Other guys' it throws their timing off, makes them look awkward.
2519577 2521179 Nobody wants to look awkward.
2521246 2522781 You know where "southpaw" came from?
2522847 2524418 MAN: Nine minutes!
2524484 2526119 I'll tell you. A long time ago, there was this guy,
2526186 2527454 maybe a couple hundred years ago,
2527521 2529656 he was fighting in the, uh...
2529724 2531160 He was fighting around... I think it was around Philadelphia.
2531226 2532761 And his arm... He was left-handed.
2532828 2535264 His arm was facing towards New Jersey, you see?
2535331 2539070 And that's south. So naturally they called him "south paw." You see?
2539136 2542942 Southpaw, South Jersey, South Camden.
2543009 2544610 Southpaw. You know what I mean?
2545745 2547613 I don't know.
2547680 2549784 Things probably worked out for the best, don't you think?
2549851 2551353 Never got a chance though because you're left-handed, huh?
2551419 2553154 Oh, that's absolutely true, you know?
2553221 2554524 Watch out. Watch out.
2555492 2556727 (EXCLAIMS)
2556793 2559496 (GROANING) I just dislocated my finger.
2560332 2561967 Ah! Look at that. Oh!
2562034 2564236 No, no. Hey, wait. Hey. It ain't your fault. Look.
2564303 2566707 See? Look, I had it... It's... It's an old wound.
2566774 2568909 You see that? Look. See?
2568976 2570611 Nothing. It bends like that.
2570678 2572015 See, I originally done it... Look, push the button.
2572081 2573883 Bong. It works.
2573950 2575151 No, it ain't your fault. Look. I'm gonna show you something.
2575218 2577153 MAN: Seven minutes!
2577220 2579124 I originally... I originally done it...
2579190 2581159 I carry pictures of all my fights.
2581226 2583094 I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. You see that?
2583161 2584531 Big Baby's about the size of an airplane.
2584598 2586733 I broke both my hands on his face.
2586800 2588135 I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture, don't you think?
2588201 2589603 See how it works there?
2589669 2590739 Real nice.
2591473 2592608 (SIGHS)
2592674 2594877 Come on. You having a good time?
2594943 2596213 I tell you, you can see I ain't too graceful.
2596280 2598115 You know what I mean?
2598182 2599417 I don't move well, but I tell you but I can really swat.
2599483 2600718 You know what I mean?
2600785 2602488 I can really hit hard.
2602555 2604290 But I'm a southpaw, and nobody wants to fight no southpaw.
2604357 2605691 You know what I mean? Huh?
2609664 2611099 Whoo!
2611166 2612867 You know how I got started in fighting?
2613635 2614671 Huh? No.
2615739 2617441 Am I talking too loud?
2618308 2619309 No. MAN: Three minutes!
2619376 2621313 My father, he's a...
2621380 2624116 My old man, he was never too smart.
2624183 2626353 He says to me, "You weren't born with much of a brain,
2626420 2628722 "so, uh, you better start using your body."
2628789 2630691 So I become a fighter. (LAUGHS)
2631425 2633329 You know what I mean?
2633396 2634864 (PANTING) Why you... Why you laughing?
2636432 2639504 My mother, she said the opposite thing.
2639571 2642373 What did she say? What did she say the opposite?
2642440 2644678 She said, "You weren't born with much of a body,
2644744 2646146 "so you better develop your brain."
2646213 2647481 Did she say that?
2648048 2649382 Yo, time!
2650586 2652020 Can I ask you a question?
2652087 2653489 Absolutely.
2654890 2656293 Why do you wanna fight?
2656360 2657962 'Cause I can't sing or dance.
2658028 2659430 Hey, yo.
2660364 2661532 Don't fall! Don't fall!
2662835 2665171 Hey, that was terrific. I'm pretty good at this.
2665238 2667273 You like the way I skate?
2667340 2669744 You know, last fight I had, I had with this guy named Spider Rico.
2669811 2672580 Yeah? He busted my head up there. You see that scar?
2672647 2675519 I'll tell you, things get pretty rough in the ring.
2685063 2687835 You know, some people are very shy by nature, you know?
2688903 2690204 I suppose.
2691038 2692408 (CLEARS THROAT)
2693643 2695945 I say you're very shy by nature, you know?
2696012 2697113 (LAUGHS)
2697180 2698650 I suppose.
2699250 2700685 Hey, hey.
2701452 2703121 The bum from the dark.
2703188 2704591 Get a job, you bum!
2706159 2708929 Some people think that being shy is a disease, you know?
2708995 2710799 But it don't bother me none.
2710866 2712234 Don't bother me either.
2714136 2716207 So why'd I bother bringing it up, huh?
2716273 2717841 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.
2719743 2721680 I think we make a real sharp couple of coconuts.
2721747 2723983 I'm dumb and you're shy. What do you think, huh?
2726786 2730024 I don't understand why anybody would wanna be a fighter.
2731025 2733027 Hey, you gotta be a moron.
2733094 2736499 You gotta be a moron to wanna be a fighter, you know what I mean?
2736566 2739469 It's a racket where you're almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
2740439 2741873 I don't think you're a bum.
2741940 2743475 I'm at least half a bum.
2744343 2745612 But I'll tell you something.
2746914 2749350 Worst thing about fighting is the morning after.
2749416 2750918 You know? Morning after.
2750985 2753122 I'll tell you. Yeah, the morning after a fight,
2753189 2755558 you're nothing but like a large wound, you know what I mean?
2755625 2757594 Sometimes I... I... I got pains all over me.
2757661 2759664 I feel like calling a taxi to take me
2759731 2761399 from the bed into the bathroom. You know what I mean?
2761466 2763501 Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt.
2763569 2766373 Your face is busted up. Your hands are swollen.
2766439 2768041 Look at this face. Sixty-four fights.
2768108 2769376 Look at that nose.
2769442 2770879 You see that nose?
2770946 2772681 That nose ain't never been broken.
2772748 2774783 Sixty-four fights. I had guys busting on it.
2774850 2777988 I had guys chewing on it, twisting and punching it.
2778055 2779590 I mean, whack, boom.
2779657 2782228 These guys are hitting my nose all the time.
2782295 2784163 Never broke. I'm very proud of that. Ain't that rare?
2784230 2786132 That's rare.
2786198 2787133 Why do you do it if it hurts?
2787199 2788536 Why you think?
2790471 2793207 'Cause you can't sing and dance?
2793274 2795712 Yeah, something like that. Something like that.
2795779 2797614 Hey, you wanna come inside?
2800319 2801753 No, I gotta go.
2801820 2803722 Hey, come on. Hey, I got some animals.
2803789 2806160 I got these rare, very rare animals inside.
2806226 2807961 Come on. Come on in.
2808028 2809630 No. No, I gotta go.
2809697 2812034 I gotta go, too. I gotta go to the bathroom. Come on.
2812902 2814170 Come on.
2814236 2815671 No, I gotta go. Hey, I gotta...
2815738 2817574 Hey, look at this face.
2817641 2819844 Is that a face you could trust or what? Huh?
2819911 2822647 Is it? They ought to stick this face on a stamp. What do you think?
2823514 2824517 (LAUGHS SOFTLY) Huh?
2824584 2825985 Come on. Come on in.
2831893 2832994 Yo, come on.
2853923 2854958 Click.

2865973 2868075 I got, uh... If you like sodas, donuts or something.
2868909 2870811 Got a couple cupcakes. Huh?
2871245 2872681 No?
2872748 2874450 I think I got some chocolate in there.
2874517 2875684 No?
2883830 2885198 Hot in here, you know?
2886299 2887634 (SNIFFLING)
2887700 2889638 I could go for some music.
2895444 2897448 Yo, Adrian.
2897514 2900217 These are the exotic animals I was telling you about.
2900284 2902221 (SOFT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) These are my friends, Cuff and Link.
2902288 2903222 I sold them to you.
2904223 2905825 I know you sold them to me.
2905891 2908229 Remember you were working at that pet shop? Huh?
2908296 2910998 First day you was there, and I came in and bought both these animals, huh?
2911766 2913870 Sure, I remember that.
2913937 2916706 I came and I bought this bowl and I bought the, uh, animals themselves.
2916773 2919175 Some food, the marbles that go on the bottom there.
2919242 2921246 Remember in that... Remember that mountain?
2921313 2923515 I had to get rid of that mountain though,
2923582 2925652 'cause they kept falling over and flipping. You know what I mean?
2928989 2931694 You know, why don't you come on over here and sit down?
2932127 2933095 Hmm?
2934163 2935931 It's a nice couch. I don't know.
2938603 2940171 There's big bugs in there, you know.
2940238 2941205 It's safer over here.
2942340 2943676 (CHUCKLES)
2944344 2945812 You wanna sit down?
2951753 2954155 Uh, these... These your parents?
2954222 2955959 Yeah, that's both of them there.
2956527 2958161 Is this you?
2958228 2959897 Yeah. That's me when I was eight-years-old.
2959963 2961834 That's the Italian Stallion when he was a baby.
2964637 2965971 Why don't you come on over?
2966038 2967708 Make yourself comfortable. Relax.
2973347 2974617 Do you have a phone?
2974684 2976719 No, I got no phone. I had it pulled.
2976786 2978555 'Cause people calling all the time,
2978621 2981326 and, uh, who needs the aggravation, right?
2981393 2982894 Interruptions.
2982961 2984095 Who'd you wanna call?
2985230 2986867 I wanna let my brother know where I am.
2988201 2989202 Why?
2991439 2993108 I think he might be worried.
2993175 2995744 Well, I'll call your brother, if that's the problem.
2998683 3000851 Yo, Paulie! Your sister's with me!
3000918 3003354 I'll call you back later! See you!
3010265 3012133 What's the matter? You don't like the room, do you?
3012634 3013768 It's fine.
3013835 3015236 Well, it's only temporary.
3016273 3017808 It's not that.
3022715 3025784 What's the problem? You don't like me?
3025851 3028022 You don't like the turtles? What's the problem?
3028089 3029390 I don't think I belong here.
3029457 3030925 It's okay.
3033596 3035064 I don't belong here.
3036432 3038968 Well, you know, it's okay, 'cause you're my guest.
3040605 3043475 I don't know you well enough.
3043541 3046947 I've never been in a man's apartment alone.
3048749 3051386 Well, I have, they're all the same, you know?
3056825 3058963 I'm not sure I know you well enough.
3060665 3062166 I don't feel comfortable.
3063569 3065972 Yo, Adrian, you know, I ain't so comfortable either.
3068274 3069744 I should go.
3069811 3072313 Don't go, please. Don't go. Don't go.
3074249 3075316 Don't go.
3078989 3080524 Do me a favor.
3080590 3081994 What?
3082061 3083362 Take off these glasses.
3087668 3090004 You have nice eyes, you know?
3091806 3093240 Do me another favor?
3094677 3096379 Why don't you take off that hat?
3103221 3105290 I always knew you was pretty.
3106927 3108028 Don't tease me.
3108095 3109930 I'm not teasing you.
3112835 3114203 I ain't teasing you.
3115838 3118309 I just... I wanna kiss you.
3121145 3124117 You don't have to kiss me back if you don't wanna,
3124183 3126018 but I wanna kiss you.

3208929 3210664 Hey, Rock. How you doing?
3210731 3212933 Oh, hey. Mick was looking for you up there, man.
3213000 3214470 For me? You're sure? Yeah.
3214537 3216472 Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's looking for you.
3216539 3218507 Get up there and see him. He wanted me?

3236198 3238269 Hey, you got something for me?
3238335 3241105 Yeah, there was some guy from Miles Jergens looking for you.
3241171 3243173 They need sparring partners for Apollo Creed.
3243240 3244644 You're putting me on. There's the card.
3244710 3246646 When was he here? About an hour ago.
3246712 3249148 They're probably looking for sparring partners for Creed.
3250251 3252153 I said that before, you dumb Dago!
3253888 3255692 I been coming here for six years,
3255759 3256993 and six years you been sticking it to me.
3257060 3258295 I wanna know how come?
3258361 3259729 You don't wanna know!
3259796 3261500 Yeah, I wanna know how come.
3261566 3263635 You wanna know? I wanna know now!
3263702 3265837 Okay, I'm gonna tell you!
3265904 3270010 'Cause you had the talent to become a good fighter, and instead of that,
3270077 3274083 you became a leg breaker for some cheap, second-rate loan shark!
3274850 3275985 It's a living.
3276052 3278087 It's a waste of life!
3296745 3298349 Yes. May I help you?
3303689 3306158 Oh, you must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.
3306225 3307693 Mr. Jergens is expecting you.
3307760 3309330 Just a moment.
3314302 3316539 Mr. Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.
3317374 3318375 Fine.
3319476 3320610 Will you please go in, Mr. Balboa.
3320677 3321713 Can I have that?
3321780 3323115 Oh, certainly.
3323682 3324616 Thanks.
3328889 3330357 Mr. Balboa.
3331191 3332893 How are you? George Jergens.
3332960 3334597 Take a chair, please.
3334663 3335698 Thanks.
3337733 3339202 Mr. Balboa.
3339804 3341305 Call me Rocky.
3341372 3343741 Rocky. Tell me, Rocky, you got any representation?
3343808 3345311 You have a manager?
3345378 3346646 Uh, no, just me. Hmm.
3348481 3352287 Rocky, I've got a proposition I'd like to make to you.
3352954 3354289 About sparring?
3354956 3356958 Beg your pardon?
3357025 3358996 Well, it's just that I know you're looking for sparring partners,
3359063 3360564 and I just wanna say I'm very available, you know?
3360631 3362332 I'm sure you are. Absolutely.
3362399 3364270 Sparring with the champ would be an honor,
3364336 3365771 and you know what, Mr. Jergens? What?
3365838 3367473 I wouldn't take no cheap shots either.
3367540 3369577 I'd really be a good sparring partner.
3369644 3371479 You don't understand me, Rocky.
3372413 3374315 My proposition's this.
3375652 3377454 Would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed
3377520 3379389 for the world heavyweight championship?
3384830 3385931 No.
3385997 3387568 Listen, Rocky.
3388836 3390571 Apollo's seen you fight.
3391572 3392940 He likes you.
3393006 3394777 He wants to fight you.
3394844 3396946 Well, it's just that, you see, uh,
3397012 3399917 I fight in clubs, you know, and I'm really a ham-and-egger.
3399984 3401953 This guy, he's the best,
3402019 3405625 and it wouldn't be such a good fight, but thank you very much.
3406526 3408695 I appreciate it and all that.
3408761 3411733 Rocky, do you believe that America is the land of opportunity?
3413535 3414469 Yeah.
3415370 3417241 Apollo Creed does,
3417307 3419409 and he's gonna prove it to the whole world
3419476 3422179 by giving an unknown a shot at the title.
3422980 3424550 And that unknown is you.
3425484 3427253 He picked you, Rocky.
3428387 3430758 Rocky, it's the chance of a lifetime.
3431893 3433661 You can't pass it by.
3434962 3436499 What do you say?
3441339 3443675 All right, fellas. That's enough pictures.
3443742 3446077 REPORTER 1: We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.
3446144 3448682 Apollo, how do you like the City of Brotherly Love?
3448749 3451752 APOLLO: Well, just being in Philadelphia makes me feel patriotic.
3451818 3453989 Beautiful people in a beautiful city
3454056 3455925 coming up to me on the street, wishing me the best.
3455991 3457860 I love my Philadelphia brothers,
3457927 3459730 and I'm proud to be an American.
3459797 3461799 REPORTER 2: Apollo? Champ? Apollo?
3461866 3464001 Why did you agree to fight a man
3464068 3466072 who has virtually no chance of winning?
3466139 3468474 APOLLO: Look, if history proves one thing,
3468541 3471146 American history proves that everybody's got a chance to win.
3471213 3473315 Didn't you guys ever hear of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?
3473381 3475584 (LAUGHING) Apollo? Apollo?
3475650 3478188 Uh, it is a coincidence that you're fighting a white man
3478255 3479690 on the most celebrated day in the country's history?
3479756 3482059 I don't know about that.
3482125 3484463 Is it a coincidence that he's fighting a black man
3484530 3487099 on the most celebrated day in the country's history?
3487166 3489870 MAN 1: Right on, Apollo! MAN 2: Tell the truth, brother!
3489937 3492139 REPORTER 1: Listen, Apollo. Tell me. How do you feel about your challenger?
3492206 3493874 How do I feel about him? Come here, Rock.
3493941 3495111 My main man.
3495178 3496212 Rocky, ain't you Italian?
3496279 3497747 Yeah, I'm Italian.
3497814 3500016 Well, now what does that mean?
3500083 3502287 That means, if he can't fight, I'll bet he can cook.
3502354 3503555 (ALL LAUGHING)
3504689 3506524 Do me a favor. His lungs, punch out.
3507058 3509062 Paulie.
3509129 3511999 But, Rocky, how do you expect to fight Apollo Creed?
3512065 3514203 Oh, jeez, you know, Creed's the best.
3514270 3516205 I guess I'll have to do the best I can.
3516272 3518841 Uh, tell me, Rocky, just between us,
3518907 3521912 where did you get the name "Italian Stallion"?
3521979 3526252 Oh, uh, I invented that about eight years ago when I was eating dinner.
3526319 3531359 Rocky, now your payday will be $150,000.
3531426 3532627 Any comment?
3535096 3536564 You got no comment, Rocky, right?
3536631 3538268 No. No comment.
3538335 3540537 Right. Thank you, Rocky. Oh, wait a minute.
3540604 3542773 I just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, okay?
3542839 3544576 Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky.
3545844 3547846 (LAUGHING) You believe all this?
3547913 3548914 Microphones and all that stuff.
3548981 3550017 You didn't.
3550084 3551986 Thank you, Rocky.
3552053 3553287 Who you pushing, man? Smack you in the mouth!
3553354 3554855 Thank you, Rocky.
3554922 3556592 Don't it matter he making you out a fool?
3556659 3557794 I'd break his lips.
3558561 3559962 He's taking cheap shots.
3560029 3562133 Don't bother me none.
3562200 3566871 Yo, Rocky, I guess you'll be looking for people to help you out.
3566938 3567874 Help what?
3568442 3569643 You know,
3569710 3571411 keep you living the clean life.
3572145 3574049 I do okay, you know.
3574116 3576185 You need someone to help with the exercise
3576251 3578821 and someone standing by with a towel or running errands?
3578887 3580591 You know that.
3580658 3582893 Hey, yo, Paulie, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody.
3582960 3585565 So I... I just think I'm gonna train myself, you know?
3585631 3587567 Without such good people around to help you,
3587633 3589502 you don't have such a good chance.
3590603 3592607 Einstein flunked out of school twice.

3594676 3597013 Yeah. Beethoven was deaf.
3597080 3598915 Helen Keller was blind.
3598982 3601151 I think Rocky's got a good chance.

3610998 3612800 Keep out of my freaking life!
3614101 3615838 What'd I do? Nothing.
3615905 3617573 Did I say something wrong?
3617640 3619375 You didn't say nothing. It's all right.
3619442 3621479 That's right! You didn't say nothing!
3621546 3622847 Nothing at all!
3625216 3626684 I gotta go. Oh.
3627921 3630023 PAULIE: Where are the freaking pretzels?
3633162 3635197 I got the pretzels.
3635264 3637065 Hey, you didn't have any beer?
3638500 3640871 I thought you were supposed to pick up some beer!
3649348 3652053 How'd you like hearing your name on TV tonight?
3652120 3655089 Uh, I was shocked.
3655156 3656491 Why'd you do that?
3656558 3658295 You're putting me on, right?
3658361 3659830 Absolutely.
3660864 3661998 What time should I expect you?
3662065 3663368 About 7:00.
3663435 3664436 Okay.
3664503 3665671 Hey.
3671345 3672880 (TRAIN PASSING)
3680022 3680992 Hey.
3682861 3684629 You know how I said
3684696 3685897 that stuff on TV didn't bother me none?
3686631 3687801 Yeah.
3690537 3691738 It did.
3702386 3706292 Listen, the reason I brought you here is because I wanna know
3706359 3708327 if you got any money for training expenses.
3708394 3710162 I got a few dollars.
3710229 3712200 A few bucks? Well, here. Put this in your glove.
3712267 3713468 What's this?
3713535 3715303 $500. Don't worry about it.
3717107 3719142 You know, you ain't never had any luck,
3719209 3721278 but I think this time Lady Luck may be in your corner.
3721344 3722646 What do you think?
3722712 3724449 Maybe. Maybe.
3724516 3726451 Hey, thanks for the money, Tony.
3726518 3729089 It's okay. Don't worry about it. I'll see you, all right?
3730024 3731725 Hey, wait a minute. What?
3731792 3733961 You're in training. Come on. Hey...
3741873 3743675 Yo, Tony. What?
3744709 3746678 You gonna show up at the fight?
3746744 3747948 Ringside.
3748014 3749683 Hey. Hey... (LAUGHING)
3750617 3752018 I'll see you.
3753355 3754856 (ENGINE STARTS)
3787265 3788734 ROCKY: Yeah.
3793707 3797346 Hello, kid. I seen your light. Can I come in?
3797413 3798481 Yeah, sure.
3798547 3799815 Yeah. Good.
3799882 3801919 Hey, it's a nice place here.
3803121 3805757 Anyway, what I come to tell you is that,
3806926 3810230 that what happened to you is freak luck.
3810296 3811598 Yeah, freak luck.
3811665 3813669 Ain't it true? Look at the other guys.
3813735 3815203 Now they're good fighters, right?
3815270 3817439 They're colorful. They got good records.
3817506 3820210 They fight their guts out for peanuts.
3820277 3824081 But you, you got a shot at the title!
3824148 3826519 Freak luck is a strange thing, you know?
3826585 3827953 Yeah, sure is. Can I sit down?
3828020 3829789 Yeah, sure. (SIGHS)
3830656 3831993 What the hell are those?
3832060 3833928 Uh, domestic turtles.
3833995 3836431 The one on the top is Cuff and the other guy's Link.
3836497 3837967 The rest are marbles.
3838034 3840236 Yeah? They make good soup.
3840303 3841271 (LAUGHS)
3841337 3842439 Anyway.
3842505 3845377 Look, I'm here to warn you.
3845444 3849950 You gotta be very careful about this shot that you got at the title.
3850017 3852586 Because, like the Bible says,
3852653 3854823 you ain't gonna get a second chance.
3855491 3856992 Yeah. All right.
3857059 3859161 You thought of that, huh?
3859228 3862767 Well, what you need is a manager.
3863534 3865503 A manager. Listen to me.
3865570 3869309 I know, because I been in this racket for 50 years.
3869375 3870710 50 years, huh?
3870777 3872712 50 years. God, I've seen it all.
3872780 3874816 All of it. You know what I done?
3874883 3876017 What?
3876084 3878120 I have done it all.
3878186 3882126 You should've seen me when I knocked Ginny Russell out of the ring.
3882192 3883994 Out of the goddamn ring, I tell you.
3884061 3886132 September 14, 1923,
3886198 3890636 and it was the same night that Firpo knocks Dempsey out of the ring.
3890703 3893174 The same night. So who gets the publicity? Figure that out.
3893241 3894942 Dempsey. That's right. But why?
3895009 3896144 'Cause he was champ.
3896210 3899015 No! Because he had a manager.
3899082 3900583 I had nothing.
3902085 3903755 I wanna show you something.
3903822 3904923 I want you to look at my face for a minute.
3904990 3906291 Look at this.
3906358 3907893 I got 21 stitches over this left eye.
3907959 3910497 I got 34 stitches over this eye.
3910564 3914468 You know, I had my nose busted 17 times.
3914535 3918607 The last time was with that fight with Sailor Mike.
3918674 3921546 I got that clipping here. It was a good fight.
3921612 3923648 Wanna read that?
3923714 3925917 Well, it doesn't matter.
3925983 3929355 Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear.
3930490 3931925 (EXCLAIMS)
3931991 3933929 "Rocky Marciano."
3935564 3938869 You know, you kind of remind me of the Rock, you know that?
3938936 3941138 You really think so? That's right.
3941205 3945010 You move like him, and you got heart like he did.
3945077 3948214 Yeah, I got heart, but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?
3951953 3953754 Uh, anyway.
3953821 3956993 You know, when I begun in this business, kid...
3959128 3961264 I wanna make a suggestion.
3961331 3963101 Don't drink that piss before a fight.
3963168 3965270 It's no good for you.
3966271 3968206 If you don't mind my saying.
3968273 3970110 Anyway, you know, when I started in this racket,
3970177 3972512 pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.
3972579 3974950 For $10, you got to tear somebody's throat out.
3975017 3977186 But I never had no management.
3977686 3979488 (THUD)
3979555 3981659 One time, this... This son of a bitch that I fought,
3981726 3983694 you know, he put a nail right there.
3983761 3986030 In his thumb? In the thumb, yeah, of the glove.
3986097 3988534 He punched so many holes in my face,
3988601 3990470 I had spit shooting out of my cheeks.
3990536 3991671 (THUD)
3991738 3993708 Can you imagine that?
3993775 3997312 Anyway, when I tell you what I looked like when I was in my prime.
3997379 3999516 I want you to look at something.
3999583 4001685 Will you look at that? Look at that. That's the way I looked
4002853 4005124 before these guys got at me.
4005190 4008661 That's nice. You didn't take very good care of the picture, though.
4008727 4010095 Well, I never had...
4010162 4011999 I never had no management.
4012066 4014468 That's the trouble, but now I got all this knowledge.
4014535 4017173 I got it up here. Now I wanna give it to you. (THUD)
4017240 4018775 I wanna give you this knowledge.
4018841 4020476 I wanna take care of you. I wanna make sure
4020543 4022011 that all the shit that happened to me
4022078 4023114 doesn't happen to you.
4023181 4025050 You know what I mean?
4025116 4027252 Mick, the fight's set.
4027319 4029589 Listen to me. I wanna be your manager.
4029656 4031291 You follow that, do you?
4031358 4033694 Fight's set. I don't need no manager. (THUD)
4033760 4035998 But you can't buy what I'm gonna give you.
4036065 4038400 I mean, I got pain and I got experience.
4038467 4040771 I got pain and I got experience too.
4041639 4043274 Listen, kid.
4043341 4044742 Hey, look. Hey, Mick. What?
4046210 4048081 I needed your help about 10 years ago, right?
4048147 4050616 Ten years ago. You never helped me none. You didn't care.
4050683 4052251 Well, if you wanted help...
4053555 4055423 I say, if you wanted help, why didn't you ask?
4055490 4057325 Why didn't you just ask me, kid?
4057392 4059730 ROCKY: Look, I asked, but you never heard nothing!
4060964 4062265 Well, I...
4062733 4063767 (SIGHS)
4063834 4066739 I, uh... I know I...
4066805 4068374 I'm 76 years old.
4069074 4071178 (TOILET FLUSHING)
4073180 4074448 And, uh...
4085130 4086831 Where the hell is...
4098013 4099515 Ah, shit...
4110329 4112165 Took you long enough to get here.
4113368 4115503 Took 10 years to come to my house.
4115570 4117439 Huh? What's the matter? You don't like my house?
4118306 4119843 My house stink?
4120877 4122379 That's right, it stinks!
4123313 4125250 I didn't ask no favors from you!
4126085 4127486 Don't throw it around me!
4128320 4130255 Talk about your prime.
4131092 4132359 What about my prime, Mick?
4133194 4134462 At least you had a prime!
4135663 4137700 I ain't had no prime. I ain't had nothing.
4137767 4139335 Legs are going, everything is going.
4139402 4141037 Nobody's giving me nothing.
4141104 4143141 Guy comes up, offers me a fight. Big deal.
4143208 4144509 Wanna fight the fight?
4144576 4146845 Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.
4146911 4148179 I'm gonna go and fight that big fight and what's gonna happen to me?
4148246 4149416 I'm gonna get that!
4149483 4151318 I'm gonna get that!
4152686 4154690 And you wanna be ringside and see?
4154756 4156959 Do you? You wanna help me out?
4157025 4159695 Huh? Do you wanna see me get my face kicked in?
4159761 4161832 Legs ain't working, nothing's working.
4161899 4164168 Think I'll go and fight the champ.
4164902 4166571 Yeah, I'll fight him.
4169008 4170910 Get my face kicked in.
4172714 4174449 And you come around here. You wanna move in here with me?

4505423 4507158 and the collecting job.
4507224 4509862 I can get me out of this stinking freezer.

4549214 4550984 I don't know. Gaps.
4551051 4552819 She's got gaps. I got gaps. Together we fill gaps.

4704754 4705989 (SIGHS)
4706825 4708193 Okay, I'll make the meat.
4718975 4720676 (DISHES CLATTERING)
4732459 4733493 Yo.
4734928 4735929 It's okay.
4735996 4737466 I'm sorry.

4769708 4771109 TRAINER: Underneath! Underneath! Underneath!
4771176 4772546 Knock him out! Come on!
4772613 4775649 Hold it. Hold it, Rock, will you?
4775716 4779155 You're driving me crazy. You're so sloppy because you're off balance.
4779221 4780923 Let's try this. Now take this string.
4780990 4782425 Tie it to both ankles.
4782491 4784127 Leave about two feet of slack.
4784194 4785863 I never had good footwork.
4785930 4788399 MICKEY: Never mind footwork. Now, you're off balance.
4788466 4791004 Now, Marciano had the same problem
4791071 4793540 and this string cured it.
4793606 4796712 The idea is that if you can move and you can hit
4796778 4799281 without breaking the string, you got balance!
4799348 4801316 You become a very dangerous person.
4801383 4802953 You follow me? TRAINER: Looking good, Rock.
4803020 4804388 Thanks.
4804455 4806156 Let's go. That's it. Underneath it.
4806223 4807891 WOMAN: Hey, Rock.
4807958 4809261 What? How about you give us your autograph?
4809328 4811097 Get out of here!
4811163 4813599 Don't you ever interrupt me while I'm conducting business.

4826752 4828653 Then let her train you!
4831323 4833227 Okay, no more fooling around.
4833293 4835062 Okay. Now hit it.

4858260 4860495 Really? Oh, yeah.
4860562 4862933 Terrific. I mean, you could be a heartbreaker.
4863000 4865769 You'll walk down the street breaking hearts the way you're looking.
4865836 4866770 Very sharp.

4940170 4941237 This is supposed to be private.

4965937 4968272 PAULIE: Here he is, the next heavyweight champion of the world,
4968339 4969574 Rocky Balboa!
4969640 4971945 Hello there. Rocky Balboa.
4972011 4973713 Listen, we wanna get a brief interview in with you. It won't take long.
4973780 4975448 What about me? What about you?
4975515 4976985 I'm in charge of the meat.
4977052 4978820 Fine. Would you stand behind it, please?
4978887 4980855 Listen, just settle yourself down. Just relax.
4980922 4983026 What we're going to do is just ask you a few questions, Rocky.
4983093 4985529 Just a few questions about your unique training method.
4985596 4987464 Talk to the folks at home.
4987531 4989468 They really wanna know, you know, how you got into this.
4989535 4991103 I mean, this isn't an everyday thing.
4991170 4993072 Jimmy, you guys ready?
4993138 4994842 Let's roll it. Rocky, why don't you turn right around here?
4994909 4996611 Just don't take no cheap shots, you know?
4996677 4998779 No, I won't do that. Just relax, Rocky.
4998846 5001951 Today we're here with heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.
5002018 5003820 The reason we're standing in this...
5003886 5005788 CAMERAMAN: Hey. The meat guy's sticking his face in.
5006591 5008326 Let's try it again, Rocky.
5010128 5012466 Today we're here with heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.
5012532 5015168 The reason we're standing in this refrigerated box
5015235 5018374 is that Mr. Balboa has an unusual method of training.
5018440 5020509 And in a moment, he's going to demonstrate that
5020576 5022678 for the viewing audience at home.
5022745 5025516 But first, Rocky, how did you come to train in an icebox?
5027184 5029654 Uh, well, my friend, the guy over there,
5029720 5031991 he let me in one day, and I hit the beef here and I kinda liked it,
5032058 5033926 and since I've become a challenger,
5033993 5035996 the owner don't mind neither that I come in.
5036064 5038233 Is this a common training method?
5038300 5039734 I mean, do other fighters pound raw meat?
5039801 5041837 No, I think I invented it.
5041904 5044007 Would you give us a demonstration?
5044074 5045575 APOLLO: Confirm the reservation for my people at ringside.
5045642 5047110 And be sure to fly my barber to Philly.
5051350 5054255 How much is being channeled into West Coast closed-circuit advertising?
5054322 5055389 300,000.
5055456 5056991 Make it 450.
5057058 5059193 And send the mayor's wife 200 roses from me,
5059260 5062065 and make sure we get a picture of it for all the newspapers.
5062131 5065134 Do you want to run the 15 radio spots in the Midwest?
5065201 5068039 I think you can spend your money better in Canadian publicity.
5068106 5070909 By the way, Apollo, I've got a couple of friends up in Toronto
5070975 5072713 who'd probably be able to get you a pretty good tax break.
5072779 5074915 APOLLO: (LAUGHS) George, I like your friends.
5074981 5076516 (ROCKY GRUNTING)
5082858 5084595 Hey, Champ.
5084662 5086630 You ought to come look at this boy you're gonna fight on TV.
5087832 5089600 Looks like he means business.
5089667 5091237 APOLLO: Yeah, I mean business too.
5091304 5093506 Hey, Shirley, we got any more coffee out there?
5093573 5096144 SHIRLEY: Oh, certainly, Mr. Creed. I'll get you some right away.
5096211 5098913 APOLLO: After the fight, I may just retire and run for emperor.

5171910 5174114 Oh, Adrian, I ain't mad,
5174181 5177318 it's just that, uh, when reporters are around, I get out of joint
5177384 5180056 'cause they take cheap shots, and Paulie knows that.
5181691 5183960 And there's Paulie, keeps asking me for a job all the time
5184026 5186064 but he don't know nothing about fighting.
5187131 5188733 Are you gonna say anything to him?
5190301 5191770 What's to say?
5191837 5194074 I just don't know what he wants from me.

6022344 6024079 I'll wait for you here.
6026450 6029152 How about I wait here and you fight, huh?
6030754 6032958 You know you're looking very great today, you know that?
6033025 6033993 Hmm?
6035461 6038299 I gotta go now, but, uh, don't you leave town, huh?
6039800 6041669 Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it.

6045541 6047443 Adrian, you don't think this robe is too baggy, huh?
6048478 6049614 Good luck.
6049681 6051282 Don't leave town.
6053918 6055889 BALDWIN: Now I'd like to have you to meet my colleague tonight,
6055956 6057624 working the fight with me, Stu Nahan.
6057691 6059493 Thank you, Bill Baldwin.
6059559 6061897 The electricity is all over the place tonight, as Rocky Balboa...
6063766 6065601 Hey, what the hell is that?
6065668 6067905 I trained you to be a fighter, not a billboard.
6067972 6069507 ROCKY: I'm doing it for a friend.
6069573 6071175 (CHUCKLES) What do you get out of it?
6071242 6072543 Paulie gets $3,000. I get the robe.
6072610 6074614 Shrewd.
6074681 6077417 The story about tonight's fight, their difference in style,
6077483 6079587 you can quote a recent sports magazine which said,
6079654 6080722 it could be "the caveman against the cavalier."
6080789 6082357 (CROWD CHEERING)
6082424 6084793 I notice a buzzing in the background now, Bill.
6084859 6086430 Could be the challenger is getting ready to get into the ring.
6086496 6088665 Rocky, look at my date.
6088732 6090834 Cost me $200. $250.
6090901 6092471 Oh, hey. I gotta go. I gotta work.
6092538 6093572 How's the robe?
6093639 6095374 A little baggy.
6095441 6097912 NAHAN: A 50-to-1 underdog living a Cinderella story,
6097978 6101215 and he's captured people's imaginations all over the world.
6106222 6107490 WOMAN: We love you, Rocky!
6108458 6109728 Good luck, champ.
6109794 6111096 Hey, thanks for showing up.
6112330 6114599 NAHAN: And his record, 44 victories.
6114666 6116703 He's had 38 by knockout, and he's lost 20 fights.
6116770 6119072 BALDWIN: Which makes me wonder, can he stand it?
6119139 6121443 You know, the stamina and the skill to last three rounds.
6121510 6123679 Because Las Vegas odds say no.
6123746 6126515 Rocky Balboa, climbing into the ring now.
6127451 6129487 "The Italian Stallion."
6129553 6130888 Some meat sign on the back of his robe there.
6130955 6132857 You seen what that was?
6132924 6134894 "Shamrock Meat..." (FANFARE MUSIC PLAYING)
6134961 6136963 There's a lot of noise coming from the background.
6137029 6138498 You can go deaf with that noise.
6138564 6140635 BALDWIN: They have the spotlights.
6140702 6142937 NAHAN: Am I seeing right back there? (MAN LAUGHING)
6143004 6145575 Is that the world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed?
6145642 6147744 BALDWIN: You know, he's in a boat, riding in a boat.
6147811 6148979 Is he supposed to be George Washington?
6149045 6151015 Obviously so.
6151082 6153118 He's got the hat on, the whole thing. Look at that.
6153185 6155053 NAHAN: Yeah, it's been confirmed.
6155120 6157123 The world champion, Apollo Creed
6157190 6159026 is doing an imitation of George Washington.
6159960 6161796 He's throwing money.
6161862 6163966 Remember when we were growing up,
6164033 6165535 we were taught about George Washington
6165601 6167303 and throwing a dollar.
6167370 6169641 If you threw a dollar in those days, it went a lot farther.
6169707 6170975 Now he's taking his...
6171042 6172510 Blonde wig came off.
6172577 6174312 The hat came off.
6174379 6175515 (CROWD CHEERING)
6175582 6176516 I want all of you!
6178318 6180955 And the crowd is loving every minute of it. Look at this.
6181022 6182724 Here is the world heavyweight champion.
6182791 6185160 Apollo Creed. For you around the world
6185227 6188065 he was dressed as George Washington, the father of our country.
6188699 6190067 I want all of you!
6190134 6191368 Come on, Stallion!
6192636 6194407 NAHAN: I don't believe what I'm seeing.
6194473 6195908 Uncle Sam himself!
6195975 6197810 I want you!
6197877 6201015 I want all of you! I want all of you!
6201082 6202917 He looks like a big flag.
6202984 6205488 I want you! You!
6206623 6208792 Is he talking to me? He's talking to you.
6208859 6210962 Is he talking to me? Let him talk.
6211028 6213398 I want the Stallion!
6213465 6216268 He says, "I want the Stallion." I want the Stallion."
6218105 6220608 For you in foreign countries, during World War I,
6220674 6223178 the picture of Uncle Sam with his finger pointed like that
6223245 6225715 was a recruiting poster for our fellows in the service,
6225781 6228050 the Army and the Navy. "I want you."
6228117 6230154 That's what he's doing a take on.
6230221 6233591 That's it. Creed, he's yelling, "Creed in three."
6233658 6234994 What do you think that outfit cost?

6304753 6306555 Now he's coming over to talk to the champ.
6306621 6307825 Hey, Joe.

6394506 6396541 and you know the rules.
6396608 6398779 We'll have no low blows, watch your heads, no butting.

6406555 6408892 BALDWIN: Rocky just taking it carefully.
6408959 6412897 He's just going over and being calm, it looks like from here.
6412964 6414700 There goes the big hat.
6417837 6420674 NAHAN: I've never seen a fighter that concerned about his hair.
6421376 6422677 (BALDWIN LAUGHING)
6429453 6431889 (BELL DINGS) BALDWIN: And there's the bell for round one.
6431955 6434426 The most publicized fight of the ages.
6434493 6436228 The fighters come in to the center of the ring, looking at each other.
6436295 6438665 Rocky just looking.
6438732 6441169 Creed, the champion, zipping, throwing those jabs. Those left-handed jabs.
6441235 6443371 Right to the head. Bang.
6445175 6447810 The champ stinging the slower challenger with jabs at will.
6447877 6452117 In fact, it just looks like Rocky is blocking the blows with his face.
6452184 6454953 The champion doesn't look the best he's ever been,
6455020 6456956 but he's really moving smoothly now.
6457023 6458625 NAHAN: Well, the champion's smiling now.
6458692 6460527 He's toying with his man.
6461662 6463265 Trying to give the fans their money's worth.
6463332 6466001 He's really making a show out of it,
6466068 6469507 with a very clearly outclassed challenger right now.
6471776 6473911 He's trying to make his man make the first move.
6473978 6475915 See? Make him miss like that.
6477450 6479686 Yeah, he's just... The champ is just taunting him now.
6482424 6484492 Creed dancing around.
6485727 6487531 I don't believe this!
6487598 6490033 The champ is down! Yes, he is!
6490100 6491935 (CROWD CHEERING)
6496175 6497343 Creed is down!
6497409 6499547 What a surprise this is!
6501249 6503985 This is the first time the champion has ever been knocked down.
6504051 6506189 Louie Fillipo is giving him the count.
6506256 6509325 Six, seven, eight.
6509392 6510961 He appears to be all right.
6511028 6512464 Glassy-eyed but okay.
6512530 6514266 MICKEY: Come on, Rock, go to the ribs!
6514332 6515767 Let's go to work right now, Rock!
6515834 6516902 Come on!
6518505 6520073 Now Rocky coming back out,
6520140 6522376 and he's like a bull in a china closet.
6522442 6524480 He really wants it. Apollo, left to the head.
6525447 6527049 The champion's coming back.
6527116 6529320 He's coming off the floor now
6529387 6530855 and he's trying to put him away with the hard left.
6530921 6532390 Another left, another right.
6532456 6534325 Combinations into the face!
6534392 6535862 And that's the Apollo we know.
6540133 6542237 Now he's taunting him.
6542304 6543505 The champion's taunting Rocky to come on and get some more.
6543571 6545573 A left. Another.
6545640 6548345 Another left. Balboa jumped...
6548412 6550747 Rocky's coming back now!

6558558 6560328 You're holding.
6560394 6562430 CREED: You're posing as a boxer, huh?
6562496 6565101 There's no way he expected this kind of hitting power.
6565168 6567103 Oh, no way.
6567170 6569005 But you know, with the ability of the champion...

6613165 6614933 (BELL DINGS) NAHAN: Here we go. Round two.
6615000 6616935 Creed predicted he'd win it in three.
6617002 6618872 Creed got knocked down in the first.
6618938 6620274 He came back strong at the end of the first.

6629552 6632090 The champion's got him backed into the corner.
6632157 6633691 Pummeling him left and right, his head bouncing against the ring ropes.
6635260 6638198 Oh, Balboa's taking a tremendous beating here.
6638265 6640233 Battering him like a punching bag.

6666367 6668905 The champion is trying to get out of there, but he just can't do it.
6668972 6672710 He is being barraged with lefts and rights to the head and to the body.

6758558 6760060 I don't know.
