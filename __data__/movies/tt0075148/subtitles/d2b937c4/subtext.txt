1470440 1473000 He took his best shot and become champ.
1473640 1475551 What shot did you ever take?
1475640 1478712 Hey, Rocky,<br />you're not happy with your life, that's nice.
1478800 1481951 But me, l got a business going.<br />l don't have to take no shots.
1482040 1483951 <i>...no one having gone</i><br /><i>more than 12 rounds with him...</i>
1484040 1486634 -That's right.<br /><i>-...and that was Jake Dale last June...</i>
1486720 1490269 -Stick that up your business.<br />-Why you getting so insulted?
1490800 1493314 You want me to take a shot? All right.
1493520 1495033 l'll take a shot.
1508120 1510509 -Hey, Rocky, how about a bottle?<br />-No wine, man.
1510600 1513672 -Come on. Just a little.<br />-Buy us some Thunderbird.
1515040 1517156 Marie, does your brother know<br />you're hanging out so late?
1517240 1519310 -Get lost, creep.<br />-Screw you, yo-yo!
1519400 1521356 These guys teach you to talk like that?
1521440 1524159 -Stuff it!<br />-Don't you never say that to me.
1524840 1527274 You stink up the neighborhood!
1528800 1530552 You know, you can...
1530680 1534753 When l was your age, only one girl in<br />the whole neighborhood talked like that.
1534840 1536637 That was it. Just one.
1536800 1539792 What are you doing?<br />lt'll make your teeth yellow. Don't do that.
1539880 1541108 l like yellow teeth!
1541200 1543475 -lt'll make your breath like garbage.<br />-Maybe l like garbage.
1543560 1545278 Nobody likes garbage.
1545680 1548069 Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth<br />wasn't bad looking,
1548160 1550549 but none of the guys ever took her serious.
1550640 1552392 They never took her out<br />for any serious date.
1552480 1553959 -Why?<br />-'Cause that's the way guys are.
1554040 1555996 They laugh when you talk dirty.<br />They think you're cute.
1556080 1558640 After a while, you get a reputation.<br />You get no respect.
1558720 1560950 You understand? You get no respect.
1561040 1563634 l gotta use a bad word, whore.
1563720 1565551 You understand? Whore.
1565640 1569428 See? You use dirty words,<br />and maybe you end up becoming a whore.
1569800 1571358 Come on, Rocky. l'm 12.
1571440 1573715 That don't matter.
1573800 1576758 You don't really have to be one.<br />Just act like one and that's it.
1576840 1580355 Boom ! Bing! You get a bad rep.<br />You understand?
1580680 1583831 Twenty years from now,<br />people are gonna say,
1583920 1586150 ''Do you remember Marie?''<br />''No. Who was she?''
1586240 1588708 ''She was the little whore who hung down<br />at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.''
1588800 1590995 ''Oh, yeah. Now l remember her.''
1591080 1594436 You see, they don't remember you.<br />They remember the rep.
1594520 1595999 You understand?
1596960 1600111 You got a boyfriend?<br />No, you ain't got a boyfriend.
1600480 1603119 You know why?<br />Why don't you think you have a boyfriend?
1603200 1605873 'Cause you're hanging out with them<br />coconuts on the corner.
1605960 1607678 You hang around coconuts,<br />you get nowhere.
1607760 1609432 They're lemons. Lemons.
1609520 1612432 You hang out with nice people,<br />you get nice friends. You understand?
1612520 1614875 You hang out with smart people,<br />you get smart friends.
1614960 1617394 You hang out with yo-yo people,<br />you get yo-yo friends.
1617480 1619789 You see, it's simple mathematics.
1620600 1622033 -l hope you ain't...<br />-l won't.
1622120 1623155 What was l gonna say?
1623240 1626152 You hope l don't keep acting<br />like a whore or l'll turn into one, right?
1626240 1627275 Yeah, something like that.
1627360 1628429 Good night, Rocky.
1628520 1630715 -Good night. Take care.<br />-Hey, Rocky.
1630800 1633314 -Yo.<br />-Screw you, creep-o!
1640920 1643593 Yeah, who are you to give advice, creep-o?
1643680 1645033 Who are you?
1663120 1666192 -Are the doctor's reports confirmed?<br />-Definitely.
1666440 1668237 Says here Mac Lee Green has suffered
1668320 1671676 ''a severely cracked third metacarpal<br />in his left hand.''
1672160 1673434 Damn!
1673600 1677434 We can cancel the fight indefinitely<br />if you're set on fighting Green.
1677520 1679476 Hey, it ain't just Green.
1679760 1681990 What about all the time<br />Apollo has invested?
1682080 1683672 We can find a solution.
1683760 1684795 Solution nothing.
1684880 1687474 Find me another ranked contender<br />in a flash, Jergens.
1687560 1689437 Don't play games with my client.
1689520 1691988 Apollo's already done a million dollars'<br />worth of publicity,
1692080 1694878 has made contractual obligations<br />with 20 different organizations.
1694960 1696598 He's not going to be embarrassed!
1696680 1698955 l contacted Ernie Roman's manager.
1699040 1700917 Ernie's fighting in France that same week.
1701000 1703036 Then get me Buddy Shaw.<br />He's ranked fifth.
1703120 1705839 Went to California and gained 50 pounds.
1706400 1708197 l called every worthwhile contender.
1708280 1712068 They all say five weeks isn't enough time<br />to get into shape.
1712160 1714549 Shape nothing, man. They're afraid.
1714680 1716591 They know everybody<br />is gonna see this fight.
1716680 1718398 None of them's got<br />a prayer of whipping me.
1718480 1722359 They're making excuses so they don't<br />have to be the chump who gets whipped.
1722440 1724954 All l can say is l'm a good promoter.
1725440 1728477 l've promoted fights<br />in every goddamn country in the world
1728560 1730630 and l've broken my ass over this one.
1730720 1732836 l don't know what else to do!
1738200 1739315 l do.
1741560 1745348 Without a ranked contender,<br />what this fight needs is a novelty.
1745760 1748115 This is the land of opportunity, right?
1748200 1750509 So, Apollo Creed, on January 1st,
1750600 1753558 gives a local underdog fighter<br />an opportunity.
1754240 1758392 A snow-white underdog, and l'm gonna<br />put his face on this poster with me.
1758480 1760277 And l'll tell you why.
1760360 1762271 Because l'm sentimental.
1762600 1765239 A lot of other people in this country<br />are just as sentimental
1765320 1767993 and there's nothing they'd like better<br />than to see Apollo Creed
1768080 1771072 give a local Philadelphia boy<br />a shot at the greatest title in the world
1771160 1773390 on this country's biggest birthday.
1773480 1775471 Now that's the way l see it
1775800 1777950 and that's the way it's gonna be.
1778040 1779632 Apollo, l like it.
1780120 1781792 lt's very American.
1782480 1785358 No, Jergens. lt's very smart.
1808920 1810990 -What is it?<br />-l wanna check this thing out.
1811080 1814675 You said pick up two yards from Snyder<br />and a grand from Cappoli, right?
1814760 1818673 No, no. Two yards from Cappoli<br />and a grand from Snyder.
1818760 1820432 -Two yards.<br />-Write it down, okay?
1820520 1822033 Yeah, l got it.
1822120 1825396 Who's this girl you're going out with<br />tomorrow night?
1825560 1827630 -How'd you know?<br />-l know.
1827720 1830712 Don't you think l hear things?<br />Lot of canaries flying around the docks.
1830800 1832916 -l'm going out with Paulie's sister.<br />-Hey, Rocky.
1833000 1835116 -What?<br />-l hear she's retarded.
1835320 1837276 She ain't retarded. She's shy, you know?
1837360 1841717 Tell you what to do. Take her to the zoo.<br />l hear retards like the zoo.
1841800 1843597 -This bum gotta say that?<br />-Who you calling a bum?
1843680 1845398 -Back it up, Buddy.<br />-l'm calling you a bum !
1845480 1848631 Relax, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood.<br />lt's his prostate.
1848720 1851678 He's always in a bad mood.<br />You ought to count your blessings.
1851760 1853352 You're still a healthy person.
1853440 1855556 -l don't like your face.<br />-l don't like yours either!
1855640 1857596 -Kiss my ass!<br />-Come out here!
1857680 1860114 Relax! Relax. My ears.
1860200 1862714 Are you driving me crazy? Both of you.
1862920 1865388 Look. Buddy doesn't like you.
1865880 1868599 Some guys, they just hate for no reason.<br /><i>Capisce?</i>
1868680 1870272 -Yeah.<br />-Come here.
1871720 1874917 Here's 50 bucks. You and your girl Adrian,<br />you have a nice time.
1875000 1876149 Thanks.
1877360 1879271 How'd you know her name?
1879360 1881510 You don't think l hear things?
1882200 1883519 -Hey, Rock.<br />-What?
1883600 1884874 -Remember what l told you?<br />-What'd you tell me?
1884960 1886029 Take her to the zoo.
1886120 1887951 Come on out of the car!
1894200 1897351 -Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?<br />-No, thanks, Shirley.
1898000 1899718 What do you think about Billy Snow?
1899800 1900915 Fouls.
1902360 1904157 How about Big Chuck Smith?
1904240 1906196 No, he's too old and dull.
1906360 1908191 Hey, that Bobby Judge, he's a good boy.
1908280 1909918 No. l don't feel no heat from that name.
1910000 1912036 Joe Zack's a good prospect.
1913240 1915959 Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
1917000 1919150 This is what l'm looking for.
1919320 1921311 The ltalian Stallion.
1921720 1924029 Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.
1924480 1926436 Look, it's the name, man.
1926520 1928431 The ltalian Stallion.
1929320 1930912 The media will eat it up.
1931000 1933719 Who discovered America?<br />An ltalian, right?
1934040 1937396 What would be better than to get it on<br />with one of his descendants?
1937480 1938879 He's a southpaw.
1938960 1940598 l don't want you messing around<br />with southpaws.
1940680 1942671 -They do everything backwards.<br />-Southpaw nothing.
1942760 1944591 l'll drop him in three.
1945640 1949235 Apollo Creed meets the ltalian Stallion.
1950960 1952951 Sounds like a damn monster movie.
1953280 1955236 What are you doing with that bat?
1955320 1956912 l used to be deadly at stickball.
1957000 1959719 -Your sister knows l'm coming?<br />-She's very excited.
1960080 1962071 -Look at these swollen hands.<br />-Yeah.
1962160 1965436 The joints from carrying meat<br />in and out of the freezer.
1965520 1968592 -Plays hell on the joints.<br />-Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
1968680 1970511 l don't need a doctor.<br />l need a different job.
1970600 1972909 Different job. What kind of turkey?<br />Big? Small?
1973000 1976231 Talk to Gazzo. Tell him l'm a good man.
1976320 1979232 Nothing bothers me.<br />l'd make a great collector.
1979320 1981231 Busting bones don't bother me.
1981320 1983595 Don't bother you. Big turkey, right?
1983680 1986558 Gazzo's gotta give me... Forget Gazzo.<br />lt's a bad job.
1986640 1988119 You got a match?
1988200 1990031 Go to him for me. As a favor.
1990120 1992759 Yeah, yeah. Last time l had a turkey
1992840 1996196 was when they had a two-dollar special<br />at Horn and Hardart's three years ago.
1996280 1998669 Last year, me and the turtles had Spam.
2006600 2010354 -Your sister knows l'm coming?<br />-Yeah, yeah. She's very excited.
2013600 2015875 Will you forget about Gazzo?
2016520 2017953 l don't ask nobody twice.
2018040 2019871 Don't ask nobody twice.
2025160 2027037 You're sure your sister knows l'm coming?
2027120 2029076 Yeah. She's very excited.
2032600 2034272 Paulie, you're late.
2035280 2036508 You call the hospital?
2036600 2039558 She calls the hospital<br />if l'm ten minutes late.
2040440 2042078 Yo, how you doing?
2043120 2045395 l told you, she's very excited.
2047880 2050110 Why didn't you tell me<br />you were bringing him here?
2050200 2051713 l'm not ready for this.
2051800 2054109 Would it make a difference if you were?
2054200 2056555 -He's taking you out.<br />-No, l can't.
2057800 2060439 l want you out of the kitchen right now.
2061080 2062274 l won't.
2066960 2069394 l want you out of here instamatically!
2069480 2071994 l'm sick of seeing you<br />hanging around like a freaking spider.
2072080 2074150 Go out and live. Enjoy life!
2074360 2075918 l can't go!
2076000 2077831 Don't get wise with me now.
2077920 2079558 l'm tired of you being a loser.
2079640 2081710 Don't call me that, Paulie!

2190360 2191475 You're doing fine.
2191560 2193790 l ain't doing fine. l look like an idiot.
2193880 2195791 Keep doing what you're doing. Funny.
2195880 2197996 l know all about these things.
2198080 2199752 l feel like a jerk.
2205520 2207829 Yo, Adrian, it's Rocky again.
2207920 2212311 Listen, l know you ain't too happy<br />at this moment.
2212840 2214432 But could you do me a favor?
2214520 2217398 l ain't got nobody<br />to spend Thanksgiving with.
2217560 2220757 So, how about maybe you and l
2220840 2222558 go out together, get something to eat.
2222640 2225074 Maybe laugh a little bit.<br />Who knows, you know?
2225160 2226832 Would you like to...
2228600 2231319 Would you like to, maybe,<br />you and me go out together?
2231400 2233868 What do you think? Would you like to?
2238680 2240796 We're gonna have a good time.
2241160 2243230 We'll have a real good time.
2247600 2249318 Thanks for the bird.
2252800 2255598 l'm gonna turn the TV off.<br />l got a headache.
2267440 2269749 -What's your sister like to do?<br />-lce-skate.
2269840 2271751 Adrian, come on.<br />You're letting the heat out.
2271840 2274035 Who pays the bills around here?
2279400 2282392 Listen, l don't want no turkey anyway,<br />you know?
2283920 2285831 But it was Thanksgiving.
2286640 2287709 What?
2287800 2289677 -lt was Thanksgiving.<br />-Yeah, to you.
2289760 2291955 But to me it's Thursday, right?
2315320 2317880 -lt looks kind of quiet.<br />-l think it's closed.
2317960 2320952 No, l think we're just early<br />or something like that.
2322320 2324072 -We're closed.<br />-What?
2324400 2327233 -l said we're closed.<br />-Yeah. Hey, listen.
2327320 2330517 l'm gonna smooth this guy out. Wait here.<br />l'll be right back.
2330720 2332438 -We could go someplace else.<br />-No, it's okay.
2332520 2336308 Are you closed to the general public,<br />or are you just closed to everybody?
2336400 2340393 lt's after 6:00. lt's Thanksgiving.<br />That's why there's nobody here.
2340720 2342676 Besides, you ain't supposed to be in here.
2342760 2345149 So do me a favor and not stay here.
2345240 2348630 -Could you do me a favor?<br />-Come on. We're not operating.
2348880 2351599 Look. This girl here ain't feeling well.
2351680 2354114 Doctors say she should go out<br />and exercise.
2354200 2356236 lce-skating's probably the best thing.
2356320 2357514 So what do you want from me?
2357600 2359397 Well, hey, l want you to do me a favor.
2359480 2360993 You can see she ain't feeling too good.
2361080 2363958 lf you can let her on the ice<br />for a few minutes, l'd appreciate it.
2364040 2365758 Ten minutes, ten bucks.
2365840 2367910 Ten bucks? How about eight bucks?
2368000 2370036 Come on. lt's Thanksgiving.
2370280 2372077 All right. Nine bucks, you got a deal.
2372160 2374799 You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.
2376840 2378512 Give her the blades.
2379280 2380508 Aren't you skating?
2380600 2382477 No, l ain't skated since l was 15.
2382560 2384755 That's when l started fighting.
2385040 2387600 Skating's kind of bad for the ankles,<br />you know?
2388520 2391159 You're a pretty good skater, aren't you?
2391920 2394309 Like l was saying<br />before on the way over here,
2394400 2397437 fighting used to be tops with me,<br />but no more.
2397520 2399909 All l wanted to do out of fighting<br />was prove l was no bum,
2400000 2402309 that l had the stuff to make a good pro.
2402400 2405278 -You never got the chance?<br />-l ain't crying about it.
2405360 2407510 l still fight. l do it like a hobby.
2407600 2409670 The trouble is l'm a southpaw.
2409760 2412558 -What's a southpaw?<br />-A southpaw means you're left-handed.
2412640 2414915 A southpaw throws your timing off.
2415000 2417195 lt throws other guys' timing off,<br />makes them look awkward.
2417280 2418793 Nobody wants to look awkward.
2418880 2421917 -You know where ''southpaw'' came from?<br />-Nine minutes!
2422000 2424912 A long time ago, there was this guy,<br />maybe a couple hundred years ago,
2425000 2428310 he was fighting in the...<br />l think it was around Philadelphia.
2428400 2432188 His arm... He was left-handed.<br />His arm was facing towards New Jersey.
2432280 2435955 And that's south. So naturally<br />they called him ''south paw.'' You see?
2436040 2439191 Southpaw, South Jersey, South Camden.
2439640 2441392 Southpaw. You know what l mean?
2442840 2444876 Things probably worked out for the best,<br />don't you think?
2444960 2447520 Never got a chance<br />because you're left-handed, huh?
2447600 2449591 That's absolutely true, you know?
2449680 2450874 Watch out.
2452800 2455712 Ah! Ah! l just dislocated my finger.
2456040 2457519 Ah! Look at that.
2458240 2459958 Wait. lt ain't your fault. Look.
2460040 2462315 See? l had it... lt's an old wound.
2462400 2464550 You see that? Look. See?
2464640 2465993 Nothing. lt bends like that.
2466080 2468913 l originally done it... Push the button.<br />Bong. lt works.
2469000 2471753 -lt ain't your fault. Look.<br />-Seven minutes!
2472480 2475358 l originally done it...<br />l carry pictures of all my fights.
2475440 2478079 l originally done it<br />in the Baby Crenshaw fight.
2478160 2481072 Baby's about the size of an airplane.<br />l broke both hands on his face.
2481160 2484391 l lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,<br />don't you think?
2484480 2485754 Real nice.
2487160 2489435 Come on. You having a good time?
2490120 2491951 You can see l ain't too graceful.
2492040 2496238 l don't move well, but l can really swat.<br />l can really hit hard.
2496320 2499835 But l'm a southpaw,<br />and nobody wants to fight no southpaw.
2504840 2507479 You know how l got started in fighting?
2507560 2508595 No.
2509360 2511191 Am l talking too loud?
2511480 2512993 Three minutes!
2513080 2517437 My father, he's a...<br />My old man, he was never too smart.
2517520 2519511 He says to me,<br />''You weren't born with much of a brain,
2519600 2521989 ''so you better start using your body.''
2522080 2523911 So l become a fighter.
2524560 2526232 You know what l mean?
2526320 2528072 Why you laughing?
2529360 2532158 My mother, she said the opposite thing.
2532240 2534390 What did she say the opposite?
2535000 2537195 She said,<br />''You weren't born with much of a body,
2537280 2538952 ''so you better develop your brain.''
2539040 2541679 -Did she say that?<br />-Yo, time!
2542920 2545673 -Can l ask you a question?<br />-Absolutely.
2546880 2550156 -Why do you wanna fight?<br />-'Cause l can't sing or dance.
2551760 2553398 Don't fall!
2554600 2556909 That was terrific. l'm pretty good at this.
2557000 2558194 You like the way l skate?
2558280 2561192 Last fight l had,<br />l had with this guy named Spider Rico.
2561280 2563874 He busted my head up there.<br />You see that scar?
2563960 2566838 l'll tell you,<br />things get pretty rough in the ring.
2575920 2578753 You know,<br />some people are very shy by nature.
2579640 2580959 l suppose.
2583760 2586513 l say you're very shy by nature, you know?
2587720 2589039 l suppose.
2591600 2593272 The bum from the dark.
2593360 2594952 Get a job, you bum !
2595760 2598513 Some people think<br />that being shy is a disease,
2598600 2600477 but it don't bother me none.
2600560 2602391 Don't bother me either.
2603680 2605716 So why'd l bother bringing it up?
2605800 2607870 'Cause l'm dumb, that's why.
2609080 2611036 l think we make<br />a sharp couple of coconuts.
2611120 2613839 l'm dumb and you're shy.<br />What do you think?
2616000 2619436 l don't understand<br />why anybody would wanna be a fighter.
2619760 2624834 You gotta be a moron to wanna<br />be a fighter, you know what l mean?
2625360 2628716 lt's a racket where you're<br />almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
2628800 2632076 -l don't think you're a bum.<br />-l'm at least half a bum.
2632280 2634350 But l'll tell you something.
2635200 2637668 Worst thing about fighting<br />is the morning after.
2637760 2639079 -You know?<br />-Morning after.
2639160 2640957 Yeah, the morning after a fight,
2641040 2643474 you're like a large wound,<br />you know what l mean?
2643560 2645516 Sometimes l got pains all over me.
2645600 2649149 l feel like calling a taxi to take me<br />from the bed into the bathroom.
2649240 2651037 Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt.
2651120 2653873 Your face is busted up.<br />Your hands are swollen.
2653960 2656918 Look at this face. Sixty-four fights.<br />Look at that nose.
2657000 2659639 You see that nose?<br />That nose ain't never been broken.
2659720 2661950 l had guys busting on it.
2662040 2664952 l had guys chewing on it,<br />twisting and punching it.
2665040 2666553 l mean, whack, boom.
2666640 2669029 These guys are hitting my nose<br />all the time.
2669120 2670997 Never broke it. l'm very proud of that.
2671080 2672593 That's rare.
2672680 2675592 -Why do you do it if it hurts?<br />-Why you think?
2676960 2679474 'Cause you can't sing and dance?
2679760 2682149 Yeah, something like that.
2682240 2684276 Hey, you wanna come inside?
2686520 2687714 No, l gotta go.
2687800 2689677 Hey, come on. l got some animals.

2782480 2784516 These are my friends, Cuff and Link.
2784600 2787239 -l sold them to you.<br />-l know you sold them to me.
2787320 2789709 Remember you were working<br />at that pet shop?
2789800 2793110 First day you was there, and l came in<br />and bought both these animals?
2793200 2794269 l remember that.
2794360 2797909 l bought this bowl<br />and the animals themselves.
2798000 2800468 Some food,<br />the marbles that go on the bottom there.
2800560 2802437 Remember that mountain?
2802520 2806513 l had to get rid of that mountain.<br />They kept fall over and flipping.
2809800 2812519 Why don't you come over here<br />and sit down?
2814640 2816915 lt's a nice couch. l don't know.

2852360 2853588 Do you have a phone?
2853680 2855477 No, l had it pulled.
2855560 2857312 'Cause people calling all the time,
2857400 2859994 and who needs the aggravation, right?
2860080 2861513 lnterruptions.

2890040 2892838 -lt's fine.<br />-lt's only temporary.
2893480 2894959 lt's not that.
2899680 2902592 What's the problem? You don't like me?

2965960 2967678 Do me another favor?
2968640 2970915 Why don't you take off that hat?
2976960 2979076 l always knew you was pretty.
2980560 2983074 -Don't tease me.<br />-l'm not teasing you.

3068320 3071232 -Heard you had a fight coming up.<br />-Next month.
3071320 3072992 January 27, right?
3073080 3074911 That's good. Come down to the gym.
3075000 3077195 We'll get you in shape.<br />How's your weight?
3077280 3080033 -175.<br />-Hey, Rock. How you doing?
3080120 3082190 Mick was looking for you up there, man.
3082280 3084396 -For me? You're sure?<br />-Yeah, yeah.
3084480 3086516 He's looking for you.<br />Get up there and see him.

3089000 3090831 -Yeah.<br />-All right. Go on, babe.
3104560 3106312 You got something for me?
3106400 3109119 Yeah, there was some guy<br />from Miles Jergens looking for you.
3109200 3112510 They need sparring partners<br />for Apollo Creed. There's the card.
3112600 3114238 -When was he here?<br />-About an hour ago.
3114320 3117471 They're probably looking<br />for sparring partners for Creed.
3117560 3119869 l said that before, you dumb Dago!
3121360 3124432 l been coming here for six years,<br />and six years you been sticking it to me.
3124520 3126909 -How come?<br />-You don't wanna know!
3127000 3128672 Yeah, l wanna know how come.
3128760 3130716 -You wanna know?<br />-l wanna know now!
3130800 3132756 Okay, l'm gonna tell you!
3132840 3136719 You had the talent to become<br />a good fighter, and instead of that,
3136800 3140759 you became a leg breaker<br />for some cheap, second-rate loan shark!
3141640 3142755 lt's a living.
3142840 3144592 lt's a waste of life!
3162440 3164158 Yes. May l help you?
3169200 3171634 Oh, you must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.
3171720 3174439 Mr. Jergens's expecting you.<br />Just a moment.
3179400 3181709 Mr. Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.
3182240 3183309 Fine.
3184040 3186429 -Please go in, Mr. Balboa.<br />-Can l have that?
3186520 3188829 -Oh, certainly.<br />-Thanks.
3193440 3194759 Mr. Balboa.
3195480 3197198 How are you? George Jergens.
3197280 3198838 Take a chair, please.
3198920 3200069 Thanks.
3201840 3203193 Mr. Balboa.
3203720 3205517 Call me Rocky.
3205600 3207556 Rocky, you got any representation?
3207640 3209073 You have a manager?
3209160 3210513 No, just me.
3212080 3215709 Rocky, l've got a proposition<br />l'd like to make to you.
3216160 3219197 -About sparring?<br />-Beg your pardon?
3219280 3223558 l know you're looking for<br />sparring partners, and l'm very available.
3223760 3225512 -l'm sure you are.<br />-Absolutely.
3225600 3227033 Sparring with the champ<br />would be an honor,
3227120 3228314 and you know what, Mr. Jergens?
3228400 3230197 -What?<br />-l wouldn't take no cheap shots.
3230280 3232350 l'd really be a good sparring partner.
3232440 3234635 You don't understand me, Rocky.
3235040 3236837 My proposition's this.
3237640 3239949 Would you be interested<br />in fighting Apollo Creed
3240040 3242634 for the world heavyweight championship?
3247040 3248155 No.
3248240 3249719 Listen, Rocky.
3250600 3252511 Apollo's seen you fight.
3253320 3254878 He likes you.
3254960 3256632 He wants to fight you.
3256720 3258438 Well, it's just that, you see,
3258520 3261512 l fight in clubs, you know,<br />and l'm really a ham-and-egger.
3261600 3263397 This guy, he's the best, and
3263480 3266916 it wouldn't be such a good fight,<br />but thank you very much.
3267440 3268793 l appreciate it.
3268880 3273032 Rocky, do you believe that America<br />is the land of opportunity?
3274440 3275475 Yeah.
3276280 3277918 Apollo Creed does,
3278280 3280157 and he's gonna prove it to the whole world
3280240 3282834 by giving an unknown a shot at the title.
3283320 3285231 And that unknown is you.
3285960 3287712 He picked you, Rocky.
3288840 3291035 lt's the chance of a lifetime.
3292120 3293951 You can't pass it by.
3295200 3296758 What do you say?
3302400 3303435 <i>All right, fellas. That's enough pictures.</i>
3303520 3305272 <i>We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.</i>
3305360 3307794 <i>Apollo, how do you like</i><br /><i>the City of Brotherly Love?</i>
3307880 3311156 <i>Well, just being in Philadelphia</i><br /><i>makes me feel patriotic.</i>
3311240 3313834 <i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city</i><br /><i>coming up to me on the street,</i>
3313920 3315035 <i>wishing me the best.</i>
3315120 3317759 <i>l love my Philadelphia brothers,</i><br /><i>and l'm proud to be an American.</i>
3317840 3319319 <i>Apollo? Champ?</i>
3319400 3323075 <i>Why did you agree to fight a man</i><br /><i>who has virtually no chance of winning?</i>
3323160 3325355 <i>lf history proves one thing,</i>
3325440 3329035 <i>American history proves that</i><br /><i>everybody's got a chance to win.</i>
3329120 3332112 <i>Didn't you guys ever hear</i><br /><i>of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>
3332200 3333633 <i>Apollo?</i>
3333720 3336154 <i>lt is a coincidence</i><br /><i>that you're fighting a white man</i>
3336240 3338117 <i>on the most celebrated day</i><br /><i>in the country's history?</i>

3345680 3348148 <i>Listen, Apollo.</i><br /><i>How do you feel about your challenger?</i>
3348240 3350879 <i>How do l feel about him? Come here, Rock.</i>

3352680 3355240 <i>-Rocky, ain't you ltalian?</i><br /><i>-Yeah, l'm ltalian.</i>
3355320 3356958 <i>Now what does that mean?</i>
3357040 3359793 <i>That means, if he can't fight,</i><br /><i>l'll bet he can cook.</i>
3361440 3363874 Do me a favor. His lungs, punch out.
3363960 3365313 Paulie.
3365400 3368472 <i>Rocky, how do you expect</i><br /><i>to fight Apollo Creed?</i>
3369000 3371150 <i>Oh, jeez, you know, Creed's the best.</i>
3371240 3372832 <i>l guess l'll have to do the best l can.</i>

3375560 3378472 <i>where did you get</i><br /><i>the name ''ltalian Stallion ''?</i>
3378560 3382792 <i>Oh, l invented that about eight years ago</i><br /><i>when l was eating dinner.</i>
3382880 3387476 <i>Rocky, now your payday will be $150,000.</i>
3387600 3388953 <i>Any comment?</i>
3391080 3393878 <i>-You got no comment, Rocky, right?</i><br /><i>-No.</i>
3393960 3395359 <i>-Thank you, Rocky.</i><br /><i>-Wait a minute.</i>
3395440 3398238 <i>l just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, okay?</i>
3398320 3400311 <i>Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky.</i>
3401400 3404039 <i>You believe all this?</i><br /><i>Microphones and all that stuff.</i>

3407600 3409830 <i>-Smack you in the mouth!</i><br /><i>-Thank you, Rocky.</i>
3409920 3411717 Don't it matter he making you out a fool?
3411800 3413313 l'd break his lips.
3413440 3416910 -He's taking cheap shots.<br />-Don't bother me none.
3417000 3421630 Yo, Rocky, l guess you'll be looking<br />for people to help you out.
3421720 3422948 Help what?
3423040 3424189 You know,
3424280 3426111 keep you living the clean life.
3426200 3428350 l do okay, you know.
3428440 3430317 You need someone<br />to help with the exercise
3430400 3434075 and someone standing by with a towel<br />or running errands?
3434160 3436799 Hey, yo, Paulie,<br />who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.
3436880 3439348 So l just think l'm gonna train myself,<br />you know?
3439440 3441510 Without such good people around<br />to help you,
3441600 3443955 you don't have such a good chance.
3444080 3446548 Einstein flunked out of school twice.
3446880 3448029 That so?
3448200 3451909 Yeah. Beethoven was deaf.<br />Helen Keller was blind.
3452480 3454789 l think Rocky's got a good chance.
3460280 3462271 Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?
3462360 3465955 You looking to do a good deed?<br />Keep out of my freaking life!
3466840 3468637 -What'd l do?<br />-Nothing.
3468720 3470233 Did l say something wrong?
3470320 3471992 You didn't say nothing. lt's all right.
3472080 3473991 That's right! You didn't say nothing!
3474080 3475559 Nothing at all!
3477480 3478833 l gotta go.
3479960 3482235 Where are the freaking pretzels?
3485160 3487037 l'd like to have a pretzel.
3487120 3489111 Hey, we ain't got any beer?
3489960 3492997 l thought you were supposed to<br />pick up some beer!
3500520 3503034 How'd you like hearing your name<br />on TV tonight?
3504720 3506153 l was shocked.
3506240 3507593 Why'd you do that?
3507680 3509352 You're putting me on, right?
3509440 3510759 Absolutely.
3511520 3514159 -What time should l expect you?<br />-About 7:00.
3514240 3516071 -Okay.<br />-Hey.
3532880 3536190 You know how l said<br />that stuff on TV didn't bother me?
3536600 3537669 Yeah.
3540040 3541268 lt did.
3551480 3554916 Listen, the reason l brought you here<br />is because
3555000 3557230 l wanna know if you got any money<br />for training expenses.
3557320 3558992 l got a few dollars.
3559080 3561230 A few bucks? Here. Put this in your glove.
3561320 3564232 -What's this?<br />-$500. Don't worry about it.
3565440 3567271 You know, you ain't never had any luck,
3567360 3569749 but l think this time Lady Luck<br />may be in your corner.
3569840 3572638 -What do you think?<br />-Maybe.
3572720 3574551 Thanks for the money, Tony.
3574640 3577598 lt's okay. Don't worry about it. l'll see you.
3577880 3579598 -Wait a minute.<br />-What?
3579680 3581716 You're in training. Come on.
3589520 3591078 -Yo, Tony.<br />-What?
3591960 3594076 You gonna show up at the fight?
3594160 3595388 Ringside.
3597720 3599153 l'll see you.
3632960 3634029 Yeah.
3639320 3642676 Hello, kid. l seen your light. Can l come in?
3642760 3644955 -Yeah, sure.<br />-Yeah. Good.
3645040 3647031 Hey, it's a nice place here.
3647840 3650513 Anyway, what l come to tell you is that,
3651840 3654957 that what happened to you is freak luck.
3655040 3656871 -Yeah, freak luck.<br />-Ain't it true?
3656960 3659349 Look at the other guys.<br />They're good fighters, right?
3659440 3662034 They're colorful. They got good records.
3662120 3664315 They fight their guts out for peanuts.
3664400 3668188 But you, you got a shot at the title!
3668280 3670635 Freak luck is a strange thing, you know?
3670720 3673109 -Sure is. Can l sit down?<br />-Yeah, sure.
3674680 3677638 -What the hell are those?<br />-Domestic turtles.
3677720 3680154 The one on the top is Cuff<br />and the other guy's Link.
3680240 3681389 The rest are marbles.
3681480 3683710 Yeah? They make good soup.
3684400 3685549 Anyway.
3685640 3688393 Look, l'm here to warn you.
3688480 3692792 You gotta be very careful<br />about this shot that you got at the title.
3692880 3695553 Because, like the Bible says,
3695640 3697710 you ain't gonna get a second chance.
3697800 3699836 Yeah. All right.
3699920 3701751 You thought of that, huh?
3701840 3705116 Well, what you need is a manager.
3706000 3707991 A manager. Listen to me.
3708080 3711675 l know, because l been in this racket<br />for 50 years.
3711760 3714877 -50 years, huh?<br />-50 years. l've seen it all.
3714960 3718157 -All of it. You know what l done?<br />-What?
3718240 3720151 l have done it all.
3720240 3723835 You should've seen me when l knocked<br />that guinea Russo out of the ring.
3723920 3725751 Out of the goddamn ring, l tell you.
3725840 3727796 September 14, 1923,
3727880 3732032 and it was the same night<br />that Firpo knocks Dempsey out of the ring.
3732120 3734395 So who gets the publicity? Figure that out.
3734480 3736311 -Dempsey.<br />-That's right. But why?
3736400 3740075 -'Cause he was champ.<br />-No! Because he had a manager.
3740240 3741719 l had nothing.
3743040 3745429 l wanna show you something.<br />l want you to look at my face.
3745520 3748671 Look at this.<br />l got 21 stitches over this left eye.
3748760 3751115 l got 34 stitches over this eye.
3751200 3754476 You know l had my nose busted 17 times.
3754560 3758951 The last time<br />was in that fight with Sailor Mike.
3759040 3761838 l got that clipping here.<br />lt was a good fight.
3761920 3763751 Wanna read that?
3763840 3765876 Well, it doesn't matter.
3765960 3769270 Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear.
3774560 3778314 You kind of remind me of the Rock,<br />you know that?
3778400 3780356 -You really think so?<br />-That's right.
3780440 3783671 You move like him,<br />and you got heart like he did.
3783760 3787196 Yeah, l got heart,<br />but l ain't got no locker, do l, Mick?
3790880 3792552 Anyway.
3792640 3795598 You know, when l begun<br />in this business, kid...
3797760 3801594 l wanna make a suggestion.<br />Don't drink that piss before a fight.
3801680 3803716 lt's no good for you.
3804360 3806078 lf you don't mind my saying.
3806160 3808310 Anyway, you know,<br />when l started in this racket,
3808400 3810516 pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.
3810600 3812909 For $10, you got to<br />tear somebody's throat out.
3813000 3815150 But l never had no management.
3816480 3819358 One time, this son of a bitch that l fought,
3819440 3821271 he put a nail right there.
3821360 3823590 -ln his thumb.<br />-ln the thumb of the glove.
3823680 3828595 He punched so many holes in my face,<br />l had spit shooting out of my cheeks.
3829120 3830872 Can you imagine that?
3830960 3834350 Anyway, when l tell you what l looked like<br />when l was in my prime.
3834440 3836112 l want you to look at something.
3836200 3838714 Look at that. That's the way l looked
3839600 3841636 before these guys got at me.
3841720 3845315 That's nice. You didn't take very good care<br />of the picture, though.
3845400 3848472 Well, l never had no management.
3848560 3850710 That's the trouble,<br />but now l got all this knowledge.
3850800 3853439 l got it up here.<br />Now l wanna give it to you.
3853520 3856080 l wanna give you this knowledge.<br />l wanna take care of you.
3856160 3859232 l wanna make sure that what happened<br />to me doesn't happen to you.
3859320 3861038 You know what l mean?
3861120 3862872 Mick, the fight's set.
3862960 3865428 Listen to me. l wanna be your manager.
3865520 3866873 You follow that?
3866960 3869076 Fight's set. l don't need no manager.
3869160 3871390 But you can't buy<br />what l'm gonna give you.
3871480 3873755 l got pain and l got experience.
3873840 3876274 l got pain and l got experience too.
3876960 3878313 Listen, kid.
3878520 3879999 Hey, Mick.
3880080 3882548 l needed your help<br />about 10 years ago, right?
3882640 3885518 Ten years ago. You never helped me none.<br />You didn't care.
3885600 3887352 lf you wanted help...
3887960 3891839 l say, if you wanted help,<br />why didn't you just ask me, kid?
3891920 3894388 l asked, but you never heard nothing!
3895280 3896599 Well, l...
3899720 3901039 l know l...
3901120 3902712 l'm 76 years old.
3907240 3908389 And...
3942440 3944795 Took you long enough to get here.
3945480 3947596 Took 10 years to come to my house.
3947680 3949591 You don't like my house?
3950280 3951793 My house stink?
3952880 3954791 That's right, it stinks!
3954880 3957110 l didn't ask no favors from you!
3960080 3961832 Talk about your prime.
3962320 3964151 What about my prime, Mick?
3964400 3966277 At least you had a prime!
3967000 3969116 l ain't had no prime. l ain't had nothing.
3969200 3972033 Legs are going, everything is going.<br />Nobody's giving me nothing.
3972120 3974236 Guy comes up, offers me a fight. Big deal.
3974320 3976675 Wanna fight the fight?<br />Yeah, l'll fight the big fight.
3976760 3980196 l'm gonna go fight that big fight<br />and l'm gonna get that!
3980600 3982272 l'm gonna get that!
3983440 3985476 And you wanna be ringside and see?
3985560 3987516 Do you? You wanna help me out?
3987600 3990239 Do you wanna see me<br />get my face kicked in?
3990320 3992231 Legs ain't working, nothing's working.
3992320 3994675 Think l'll go and fight the champ.
3995120 3996838 Yeah, l'll fight him.
3999160 4000957 Get my face kicked in.
4001800 4004268 And you come around here.<br />You wanna move in with me?

4076400 4079312 <i>lt's only about 28 degrees.</i><br /><i>We'll check that forecast.</i>
4079400 4082198 <i>l feel very mischievous, very weird, very...</i>
4083480 4085630 <i>l got vinyl seats in my car.</i>
4085720 4088678 <i>When l hit those seats this morning,</i><br /><i>l just went, ''Whoo!''</i>
4088760 4092833 <i>l figure if l'm up, everybody</i><br /><i>in the Delaware Valley should be up.</i>
4092920 4094194 <i>You agree with me?</i>
4094280 4097955 <i>At three minutes past 4.:00 in the morning,</i><br /><i>what else you gonna do?</i>
4099400 4100515 <i>Hello?</i>
4100600 4103990 <i>Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.</i><br /><i>This is Don Cabot, WYBG Philadelphia?</i>
4104080 4106230 <i>-How are you this morning?</i><br /><i>-What?</i>
4106320 4110029 <i>You have a lot of nerve</i><br /><i>calling me at this hour of the morning!</i>
4110120 4111348 <i>Good-bye!</i>
4124000 4126560 <i>Me and Mrs. Kramer are up,</i><br /><i>and it's a good morning.</i>
4126640 4129154 <i>l tell you, l need someone</i><br /><i>to snuggle with. 28 degrees.</i>
4129240 4131196 <i>lt's cold out there. We deserve it.</i>
4131280 4133635 <i>We've been getting away with murder</i><br /><i>the last couple of weeks.</i>
4133720 4135711 <i>Our high today could be...</i>
4135800 4138553 <i>Tonight we're back down</i><br /><i>in the 20-degree range.</i>
4138640 4140073 <i>A little colder in the suburbs.</i>
4140160 4143232 <i>Tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,</i><br /><i>we may hit 40.</i>
4143320 4145151 <i>But it's 28. lt's awfully chilly.</i>
4145240 4147879 <i>Make sure you have it bundled up</i><br /><i>before you bring it out.</i>
4284200 4285394 Come on.
4286320 4288788 lt stinks in here, you know?
4288880 4290598 Yeah. l know.
4292360 4294476 Did you kill all these things?
4295080 4296911 No, across the street.
4298800 4301473 lt's like an animal morgue.
4301960 4303712 lt's a little cold in here, ain't it?
4303800 4304835 Yeah.
4309160 4311230 Who killed all these things?
4311720 4313312 Are you crazy, Paulie?
4313400 4315550 lf you don't pay Gazzo,<br />you end up on a hook.
4315640 4317710 Gazzo's a good man. You know that.
4317800 4319518 Don't get excited. l know that.
4319600 4323354 That's why l wanted you to talk to him<br />about me and the collecting job.
4323440 4325829 And can get me out of<br />this stinking freezer.
4325920 4329754 Why don't you do yourself a favor?<br />Keep this job. You eat better.
4331080 4332115 Moo.
4332680 4334716 Does it ever snow in here?
4335440 4339479 You and my sister,<br />how you getting along together?
4340360 4341952 How do you think?
4342480 4344994 l'm not sure, Rock. What's the story?
4345960 4347279 About what?
4347520 4349112 What's happening?
4349920 4351558 You really like her?
4351640 4353198 Sure, l like her.
4355200 4357760 l don't see it. What's the attraction?
4358760 4361433 l don't know. Fills gaps, l guess.
4362120 4363553 What's ''gaps''?
4363880 4367714 l don't know. She's got gaps.<br />l got gaps. Together we fill gaps.
4370120 4371678 You balling her?
4373760 4376354 You don't talk dirty about your sister.
4378120 4380190 Are you screwing my sister?
4382560 4385870 You see?<br />That's why l can't connect you with Gazzo.
4385960 4389157 Because you got a big mouth.<br />You just talk too much.
4390120 4392918 -lt's cold in here. l'm going home.<br />-Cold in here?

4465120 4467270 -l turned the heat up.<br />-Thanks.
4467680 4471434 Your brother's a good man,<br />but he's awful pushy, you know?
4481320 4484232 -You want me to rub you down?<br />-No, l'm just sore, okay?
4484320 4486470 -l'm gonna just sit here.<br />-You sure?
4486560 4487913 Yeah, l'm sure.

4580080 4583914 You're driving me crazy. You're so sloppy<br />because you're off balance.
4584000 4585831 Let's try this. Take this string.

4593120 4595509 Marciano had the same problem
4595600 4597670 and this string cured it.
4598160 4602870 lf you can move and hit without<br />breaking the string, you got balance!
4602960 4605155 You become a dangerous person.
4605240 4607117 -You follow me?<br />-Looking good, Rock.
4607200 4609156 -Thanks.<br />-Let's go. That's it.

4802240 4804196 Let's try it again, Rocky.
4805000 4807958 <i>Today we're here with</i><br /><i>heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.</i>
4808040 4810474 <i>The reason we're standing</i><br /><i>in this refrigerated box</i>
4810560 4813632 <i>is that Mr. Balboa</i><br /><i>has an unusual method of training.</i>
4813720 4817030 <i>ln a moment, he'll demonstrate that</i><br /><i>for the viewing audience at home.</i>
4817120 4820556 <i>But first, Rocky,</i><br /><i>how did you come to train in an icebox?</i>
4821160 4823879 <i>Well, my friend, the guy over there,</i>
4823960 4826679 <i>he let me in one day,</i><br /><i>and l hit the beef here and liked it,</i>
4826760 4829991 <i>and since l've become a challenger,</i><br /><i>the owner don't mind that l come in.</i>
4830080 4833789 <i>ls this a common training method?</i><br /><i>Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i>
4833880 4835757 <i>No, l think l invented it.</i>
4835840 4838479 <i>-Would you give us a demonstration?</i><br />-Confirm the reservation
4838560 4841836 for my people at ringside,<br />and fly my barber to Philly.
4845160 4848072 How much is being channeled<br />into West Coast closed-circuit advertising?
4848160 4850310 -300,000.<br />-Make it 450.
4850400 4852709 And send the mayor's wife<br />200 roses from me,
4852800 4855439 and make sure we get a picture of it<br />for all the newspapers.
4855520 4858478 Do you want to run the 15 radio spots<br />in the Midwest?
4858560 4861028 You can spend your money better<br />in Canadian publicity.
4861120 4863714 By the way, Apollo,<br />l've got friends in Toronto
4863800 4865677 who can get you a good tax break.
4865760 4867796 George, l like your friends.

4883480 4885516 Shirley, we got any more coffee out there?
4885600 4888114 Certainly, Mr. Creed.<br />l'll get you some right away.

5671520 5674956 lt really don't matter<br />if this guy opens my head either.
