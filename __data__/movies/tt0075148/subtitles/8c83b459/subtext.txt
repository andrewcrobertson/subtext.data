906805 910400 When you don't do what I tell you<br />to do, you make me look bad, Rock.
910476 913639 I figured... look, I figured<br />if I break the guy's thumb,

1143108 1144473 - What?<br />- You're a tomato.

1268667 1272364 I must've had 20 bucks taken<br />out of there in the past six years.
1272437 1275065 It don't sound like much,<br />but it adds up, you know.
1275140 1277267 Doesn't matter. Who cares.

1293859 1295690 You need somebody<br />to walk you home?
1296828 1299160 - No.<br />- No? It's a cold night.
1299231 1302291 If I was you and you got the money,<br />I would take a cab or something.
1302367 1304198 Too many creeps<br />around here, you know.
1305037 1306868 Every other block,<br />there's a creep.

1446011 1450607 Well, I just don't think Gazzo's hirin'<br />right now, you know? You know?
1450682 1451842 Come on.
1455787 1457948 - The girl's dryin' up.<br />- Who?
1458023 1461686 My sister. If she don't start livin',<br />her body's gonna dry up.
1461760 1463990 You know, tomorrow's Thanksgiving,<br />you know that?
1464062 1465893 Why don't you come over<br />and talk to her?
1465964 1467363 Sure. Beer.
1467432 1469423 Tomorrow you come<br />for some bird, right?
1469501 1472265 Absolutely. You got it.
1472337 1475306 I gotta go. If I'm ten minutes late,<br />she calls the hospital.
1475373 1477068 - Paulie!<br />- I got it. I got it.
1477142 1479633 <i>Bicentennial fight with</i><br /><i>Mac Lee Green here in Philadelphia</i>
1479711 1482578 <i>at the fabulous Spectrum.</i><br /><i>Harry?</i>
1482647 1485138 <i>We're speaking now of your</i><br /><i>much publicized bicentennial fight.</i>
1485217 1486377 <i>That's right, this is gonna be</i>
1486451 1488282 <i>the greatest sporting event</i><br /><i>in the country's history.</i>
1488353 1491516 <i>A gala occurrence with me</i><br /><i>beating Green like he committed a crime.</i>
1491590 1494252 Would you take a look<br />at that guy?
1494326 1496817 I mean, where are<br />the real fighters gonna come from?
1496895 1499830 The pros. All we got today<br />are jig clowns.
1499898 1502230 <i>- On January 1st,</i><br /><i>the first major event in the country...</i>
1502300 1505463 - Clowns?<br />- That's right. Clowns.
1505537 1508199 <i>And in keeping with great events</i><br /><i>throughout the country's history.</i>
1508273 1510867 <i>Apollo Creed will duplicate</i><br /><i>the cracking of the liberty bell</i>
1510942 1512273 <i>by cracking Mac Lee Green.</i>
1512344 1514835 You callin' Apollo Creed a clown?
1514913 1516972 Well, what else?<br />Look at him.
1517048 1519380 <i>Stay in school</i><br /><i>and use your brain.</i>
1519451 1522386 <i>Be a doctor, be a lawyer,</i><br /><i>carry a leather briefcase.</i>
1522454 1524285 <i>Forget about sports</i><br /><i>as a profession.</i>
1524356 1526017 <i>Sports make you grunt and smell.</i>
1526091 1529549 <i>- See, be a thinker, not a stinker.</i><br /><i>- Okay, thanks a lot, Champ.</i>
1529628 1532222 Hey, are you crazy?<br />This man is champion of the world.
1532297 1535357 He took his best shot<br />and became champ. Huh?
1535433 1537264 What shot did you ever take?
1537335 1540827 Hey, Rocky, you're not happy<br />with your life, it's nice.
1540906 1544000 But me, I got a business going.<br />I don't have to take no shots.
1544075 1545804 <i>No one having gone more than...</i>
1545877 1547037 That's right.
1548847 1550678 Stick that up your business.
1550749 1552614 What are you so insulted about?
1553318 1557846 Want me to take a shot?<br />All right... I'll take a shot.
1570001 1571332 Rocky, how's it been going?
1571403 1572893 Hey, Rocky,<br />how 'bout a bottle?
1572971 1575303 - No wine.<br />- Come on. Just a little.
1578410 1580503 Rory, does your brother<br />know you're hanging out so late?
1580579 1582774 - Screw you, Go-go.<br />- Her brother knows.
1582847 1585008 Hey, these guys teach you<br />to talk like that?
1585083 1587517 - Stuff it, man!<br />- Never say that! Come here!
1587586 1590146 You stink up the neighborhood!
1592924 1594585 - You know, you can...<br />- Hey!
1594659 1595921 When I was your age,
1595994 1599327 there was only one girl in the<br />whole neighborhood talked like that.
1599397 1602423 That was it. Just one.<br />What are you doing?
1602500 1604468 It'll make your teeth yellow.<br />Don't do that.
1604536 1607369 - I like yellow teeth.<br />- It'll make your breath like garbage.
1607439 1610431 - Maybe I like garbage.<br />- Come on, nobody likes garbage.
1610508 1612999 Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth...<br />she wasn't bad-lookin',
1613078 1615569 but, you see, none of the guys<br />ever took her seriously, see.
1615647 1617581 They never took her out<br />for any serious datin'.
1617649 1619139 - Why?<br />- 'Cause that's the way guys are.
1619217 1621276 They laugh when you talk dirty,<br />they think you're cute,
1621353 1623344 but after a while, you get<br />a reputation, that's it.
1623421 1624911 You get no respect,<br />you understand?
1624990 1628653 You get no respect.<br />And I gotta use a bad word.
1628727 1631218 Whore.<br />You understand? Whore.
1631296 1632957 See, you use dirty words
1633031 1635556 and maybe you end up becoming<br />a whore, you understand?
1635634 1637295 Come on, Rocky.<br />I'm just 12.
1637369 1639860 Hey, that don't matter<br />that you're 12. It don't matter.
1639938 1643999 You don't really have to be one.<br />You just act like one... that's it. Boom.
1644075 1647010 Hey, if you get a bad rap,<br />you understand?
1647078 1649239 Twenty years from now,<br />people are gonna say,
1649314 1651145 "Hey, you remember Marie?"
1651216 1652615 "No, who's she?"
1652684 1655244 "She's the little whore that hung out<br />at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."
1655320 1657982 "Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah,<br />now I remember her."
1658056 1661321 You see, they don't remember you,<br />they remember the rep.
1661393 1662724 You understand?
1663962 1665793 Hey, you got a boyfriend?
1665864 1667695 No, you ain't got a boyfriend.
1667766 1670428 You know why? Why don't you<br />think you have a boyfriend?
1670502 1673300 'Cause you're hangin' out with them<br />coconuts in the corner, understand?
1673371 1675100 You hang around coconuts,<br />you get nowhere.
1675173 1677004 They're lemons.<br />Lemons.
1677075 1680238 You hang out with nice people,<br />you get nice friends, you understand?
1680311 1682802 You hang out with smart people,<br />you get smart friends.
1682881 1685281 You hang out with yo-yo people,<br />you get yo-yo friends.
1685350 1687511 You see?<br />It's simple mathematics.
1688787 1690118 - I hope you ain't...<br />- I won't.
1690188 1691348 What was I gonna say?
1691423 1694586 You hope I don't keep acting like<br />a whore, or I'll turn into one, right?
1694659 1696718 - Yeah, something like that.<br />- Good night, Rocky.
1696795 1698262 Good night, Marie.<br />Take care, you know?
1698329 1700126 - Hey, Rocky?<br />- Yo.
1700198 1702132 Screw you, creep-o!
1709774 1712607 Yeah, who are you<br />to give advice, creep-o? Huh?
1712677 1713837 Who are you?
1732897 1735832 - Are the doctor's reports confirmed?<br />- Definitely.
1735900 1737731 It says here Mac Lee Green
1737802 1742136 has suffered a severely cracked<br />third metacarpal in his left hand.
1742207 1743868 Damn.
1743942 1746206 Of course, we can<br />cancel the fight indefinitely
1746277 1747869 if you're set on fighting Green.
1747946 1750278 Hey, it ain't just Green!
1750348 1752509 What about all the time<br />Apollo has invested?
1752584 1754552 I believe<br />we can find a solution.
1754619 1756985 Solution nothin'. You better find me<br />another ranked contender.
1757055 1758545 And I mean in a flash, Jergens.
1758623 1760284 Don't play games with my client.
1760358 1762826 Apollo's already done<br />a million dollars worth of publicity,
1762894 1765886 has made contractual obligations<br />with 20 different organizations...
1765964 1767454 he's not going<br />to be embarrassed!
1767532 1770296 I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.
1770368 1772359 Ernie's fighting in France<br />that same week.
1772437 1774735 Then get me Buddy Shaw!<br />Hell, he's ranked fifth!
1774806 1777832 Went to California<br />and gained 50 pounds.
1777909 1779740 I get a hold of every<br />worthwhile contender
1779811 1781403 and they all say the same thing...
1781479 1784141 five weeks just isn't enough time<br />to get into shape.
1784215 1786547 Shape nothin', man!<br />They're afraid.
1786618 1788609 They know everybody in the world's<br />gonna see this fight,
1788686 1790517 and none of them's<br />got a prayer of whippin' me.
1790588 1792681 They're makin' excuses<br />so they don't have to be the chump
1792757 1794691 to get whipped in front<br />of the whole civilized world.
1794759 1797751 All I can say<br />is I'm a good promoter.
1797829 1800855 I've promoted fights<br />in every goddamn country in the world,
1800932 1803332 and I've broken my ass over this one.
1803401 1805733 But I don't know<br />what the hell else to do!
1811075 1812235 I do.
1814612 1815772 Without a ranked contender,
1815847 1818509 what this fight is gonna need<br />is a novelty.
1819184 1821175 This is the land<br />of opportunity, right?
1821686 1824177 So Apollo Creed,<br />on January 1st,
1824255 1827986 gives a local underdog fighter<br />an opportunity.
1828059 1829390 A snow-white underdog,
1829460 1832293 and I'm gonna put his face<br />on this poster with me.
1832363 1834194 And I'll tell you why.
1834265 1835926 Because I'm sentimental.
1836601 1839331 And a lot of other people<br />in this country are just as sentimental,
1839404 1842237 and there's nothing they'd like better<br />than to see Apollo Creed
1842307 1843797 give a local Philadelphia boy
1843875 1847936 a shot at the greatest title in the world<br />on this country's biggest birthday.
1848012 1849843 Now, that's the way I see it.
1850515 1852506 And that's the way it's gonna be.
1852584 1854745 Apollo, I like it.
1854819 1857344 It's very American.
1857422 1859083 No, Jergens.
1859157 1860818 It's very smart.
1874706 1876435 Okay, I'll see you later, man.
1884816 1887148 - What? What is it?<br />- I just wanna check this thing out.
1887218 1889686 Now, you said pick up<br />two yards from Snyder
1889754 1891244 and a grand from Cappoli, right?
1891322 1895156 No, no. No, no. Two yards<br />from Cappoli and a grand from Snyder.
1895226 1897057 - Two yards. Two yards.<br />- Write it down, okay?
1897128 1898618 Yeah, I got it. Got it.
1898696 1901096 Who's this girl you're going<br />out with tomorrow night?
1902433 1903593 How'd you know?
1903668 1905659 You know.<br />Don't you think I hear things?
1905737 1907671 A lot of canaries<br />flying around the docks.
1907739 1910207 - I'm going out with Paulie's sister.<br />- Hey, Rocky.
1910275 1912470 - What?<br />- I hear she's retarded.
1912543 1914534 She ain't retarded.<br />She's shy, you know?
1914612 1916102 I'll tell you what to do.
1916180 1919377 Take her to the zoo.<br />I hear retards like the zoo.
1919450 1921782 - This bum gotta say that?<br />- Who're you calling a bum?
1921853 1924117 - I'm calling you a bum!<br />- Okay, relax. Relax.
1924188 1926179 Buddy's in a bad mood.<br />It's his prostate.
1926257 1927747 He's always in a bad mood.
1927825 1929656 You know, you oughta count<br />your blessings, Buddy.
1929727 1931524 You're still a healthy person,<br />you know that?
1931596 1933587 - I don't like your face.<br />- I don't like yours, either!
1933665 1935496 - Kiss my ass!<br />- Move your shoulders down!
1935566 1938399 - Get out of the car!<br />- Relax, relax! Relax. My ears.
1938469 1940801 What, are you driving me crazy?<br />Both of yous.
1942840 1944501 - Buddy doesn't like you.<br />- Yeah.
1944575 1947305 Some guys, they just hate<br />for no reason, <i>capisce?</i>
1947378 1948868 - Yeah.<br />- Come here.
1950581 1953914 There's 50 bucks. You and your girl<br />Adrian have a nice time, you hear?
1953985 1955043 Thanks.
1956321 1958050 Hey, how'd you know her name?
1958122 1959987 You don't think I hear things?
1960992 1962653 - Hey, Rock.<br />- What?
1962727 1964558 - Remember what I told you.<br />- What'd you tell me?
1964629 1965789 Take her to the zoo.
1973838 1976534 - Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?<br />- No, thanks, Shirley.
1977909 1979740 What do you think<br />about Billy Snow?
1979811 1980971 Fouls.
1982280 1983770 How 'bout Big Chuck Smith?
1983848 1986009 - Yeah.<br />- Nah. He's too old and dull.
1986718 1988379 Hey, Bobby Judd.<br />He's a good boy.
1988453 1990421 No, I don't feel any heat<br />from that name.
1990488 1992479 Joe Zach's a good prospect.
1993658 1996320 Exactly what are<br />you looking for, Apollo?
1997328 1999990 This is what I'm looking for.
2000064 2001998 The Italian Stallion.
2002667 2005397 Rocky Balboa?<br />Never heard of him.
2005470 2007631 Look, it's the name, man.
2007705 2012369 The Italian Stallion.<br />The media will eat it up.
2012443 2015276 Now, who discovered America?<br />An Italian, right?
2015346 2018679 What would be better than to get it on<br />with one of his descendents?
2018750 2020581 He's a southpaw.
2020651 2022312 I don't want you messing around<br />with southpaws.
2022387 2024446 - They do everything backwards.<br />- Southpaw nothin'.
2024522 2025921 I'll drop him in three.
2027525 2031928 Apollo Creed<br />meets the Italian Stallion.
2032964 2035364 Sounds like a damn monster movie.
2035700 2037691 Hey, what are you doing<br />with that bat, huh?
2037769 2041034 I used to be deadly at stickball.<br />You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?
2041105 2042265 She's very excited.
2042340 2044604 - Look at my swollen hands.<br />- Yeah.
2044675 2047838 The joints from walkin' and<br />carryin' meat in and out of freezers.
2047912 2049243 It plays hell on the joints.
2049313 2051474 Maybe you oughta see a doctor.<br />What do you think?
2051549 2053642 I don't need a doctor.<br />I need a different job.
2053718 2056118 Different job. What kind of turkey?<br />Big turkey or small turkey?
2056187 2061181 Talk to Gazzo about me. Tell him<br />I'm a good man and nothin' bothers me.
2061259 2064422 I'd make a great collector.<br />Bustin' bones don't bother me.
2064495 2066929 Don't bother you.<br />A big turkey, right? Huh?
2066998 2070331 Gazzo's gotta come... forget Gazzo.<br />It's a bad job, you know what I mean?
2070401 2073802 - You got a match?<br />- Go to him for me. As a favor.
2073871 2076499 Yeah. Yeah. You know,<br />the last time I had a turkey
2076574 2078235 was when they<br />were having a $2 special
2078309 2080243 at Horn and Hardog's<br />about three years ago.
2080311 2082973 Last year me and the turtles<br />had spam. What do you think?
2083047 2085140 Yeah, that sounds<br />like a good idea.
2090955 2092786 Your sister knows<br />I'm coming for sure, right?
2092857 2095087 Yeah, yeah.<br />She's very excited.
2096527 2098290 I'm all alone
2098362 2100523 Hey, will you forget<br />about Gazzo, huh?
2101432 2104924 - I don't ask nobody twice.<br />- I don't ask nobody twice.
2105002 2108062 Stay away, baby
2109807 2112401 Hey, your sister... you sure<br />your sister knows I'm comin'?
2112477 2114308 Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />She's very excited.
2114378 2115402 Yeah?
2118316 2120307 Paulie? You're late.
2121052 2124385 Called the hospital? She calls<br />the hospital if I'm ten minutes late.
2126390 2127880 How you doin'?
2128960 2130894 I told you she's very excited.
2133831 2136664 Paulie, why didn't you tell me<br />you were bringing him here?
2136734 2138224 Look at me.<br />I'm not ready for this.
2138302 2140031 Would it make a difference<br />if you were?
2140104 2142095 He's a friend,<br />and now he's taking you out.
2142173 2143504 No, I can't.
2144175 2146769 You're in the kitchen,<br />and I want you out right now.
2150548 2151537 Hey.
2152216 2153649 Hey!
2153718 2156551 Hey, I want you<br />outta here instamatically!
2156621 2159454 I'm sick of seein' you hanging around<br />like a freakin' spider!
2159524 2161685 Go out! Live!<br />Enjoy life!
2161759 2163249 Paulie, I can't go!
2163327 2165318 Don't get wise with me,<br />now, huh?
2165396 2168888 - I'm tired of you being a loser.<br />- Don't call me that, Paulie!
2168966 2172299 <i>Apollo Creed says he'll</i><br /><i>be shopping for another victim</i>
2172370 2176067 <i>to fill Green's vacancy for</i><br /><i>the bicentennial championship fight.</i>
2176140 2177971 Why didn't you tell me<br />you were bringing him home?
2178042 2181409 - How do you know I didn't?<br />- I'm not gonna go, Paulie! I can't go!
2181479 2183208 - I won't go!<br />- Why?!
2184615 2187880 Paulie, it's Thanksgivin'.<br />I got a turkey in the oven.
2188653 2191053 Oh. A turkey in the oven?
2197428 2198918 A turkey in the oven.
2205903 2207564 You want the bird?
2208306 2210297 Go in the alley<br />and eat the bird.
2210374 2212342 Oh, Paulie.
2213144 2216272 I want you outta here!<br />Get outta the house!
2216347 2218941 Go out and enjoy<br />your freakin' life!
2223054 2224783 You hungry, Rock?
2231329 2234992 Yo, Paulie, listen. Maybe we just<br />better forget all this, you know?
2235066 2237057 - Just forget it.<br />- Forget nothin'.
2237134 2238624 Go ahead.<br />Tell her somethin' funny.
2238703 2242104 Ain't nothin' to talk about. She's in<br />a bad mood, I'm in a bad mood.
2242173 2244835 You know how to do funny.<br />You wanna go out with my sister?
2244909 2247969 - Yeah.<br />- Well... come on.
2250581 2252071 I don't know what to say.
2265129 2267620 Yo, Adrian,<br />it's me, Rocky.
2267698 2269097 Rocky, you know?
2270101 2271432 Listen, uh...
2273271 2274602 I don't know what to say,
2274672 2277402 'cause I ain't never talked<br />to no door before, you know?
2279210 2282077 I mean, what do I say<br />to a door... hey, listen...
2282146 2283875 Come on.<br />You're doin' fine.
2283948 2286348 I ain't doin' fine.<br />I look like an idiot.
2286417 2288408 Keep doin' what you're doin'.<br />You're funny.
2288486 2290477 I know all about these things.
2290554 2291953 I feel like a jerk.
2298529 2301020 Yo, Adrian,<br />it's Rocky again, you know?
2301098 2302429 Listen, uh...
2303434 2306096 I know you ain't too happy<br />at this moment, you know,
2306170 2307762 but could you do me a favor?
2307838 2310830 I ain't got nobody to spend<br />Thanksgiving with, you know?
2310908 2312569 So, uh...
2312643 2316238 how 'bout maybe you and I maybe<br />go out together, get something to eat.
2316314 2319044 I don't know. Maybe laugh a little bit.<br />Who knows, you know?
2319116 2320606 Would you like to, uh...
2322420 2325480 I don't know. Would you like to maybe,<br />you know, you and me go out together?
2325556 2327387 What do you think?<br />Would you like to?
2333097 2334587 We're gonna have a good time.
2335700 2337531 We'll have a real good time.
2342473 2343804 Thanks for the bird.
2347778 2350372 I'm gonna turn the TV off.<br />I got a headache.
2363160 2365651 - What does your sister like to do?<br />- Ice skate.
2365730 2367721 Adrian, come on.<br />You're lettin' the heat out.
2367798 2369527 Who pays the bills around here?
2375439 2378169 Listen, I don't want<br />no turkey anyway, you know?
2380277 2381938 But it was Thanksgiving.
2383080 2385344 - It was what?<br />- It was Thanksgiving.
2385416 2388078 Yeah, to you.<br />But to me it's Thursday.
2413043 2415773 - It looks kinda quiet, you know?<br />- I think it's closed.
2415846 2418508 No, I think maybe we're just early<br />or something like that.
2419083 2420243 - Yo!<br />- Yo!
2420317 2422478 - We're closed.<br />- What?
2422553 2423884 I said we're closed.
2423954 2426445 Yeah. Hey, listen, I'm gonna<br />smooth this guy out here.
2426524 2429015 So just wait here for a few minutes.<br />I'll be right back, okay?
2429093 2430924 - We could go someplace else.<br />- No, it's okay.
2430995 2432929 Hey, listen, are you closed<br />to the general public,
2432997 2435158 or are you closed to everybody...<br />you know what I mean?
2435232 2439396 Look, it's after 6:00, it's Thanksgiving.<br />That's why there's nobody here.
2439470 2441529 And besides, you ain't<br />supposed to be in here.
2441605 2443937 So do me a favor<br />and not stay here, huh?
2444008 2448001 - Would you do me a favor?<br />- Hey, come on. We're not operatin'.
2448078 2450740 Look... this girl here<br />ain't feelin' well, you know.
2450815 2453375 The doctors say she should go out<br />and exercise once in a while,
2453451 2455612 and ice skating's probably<br />the best thing, know what I mean?
2455686 2457176 So what do you want from me?
2457254 2460382 I want you to do me a favor.<br />You could see she ain't feelin' too good.
2460458 2463586 If you could let her on the ice,<br />I'd appreciate it. For a few minutes.
2463661 2465492 Ten minutes, ten bucks.
2465563 2467827 Ten bucks? How 'bout eight...<br />eight bucks?
2467898 2470230 Come on. It's Thanksgiving.
2470301 2472292 All right, nine bucks,<br />you got a deal.
2472369 2474667 You have the ice to yourself.<br />Ten bucks.
2477208 2478539 Give her the blades.
2479844 2480902 Aren't you skating?
2480978 2482969 Nah. I ain't skated since I was 15.
2483047 2485379 That's when I started fightin'...<br />when I was 15.
2485449 2487781 Skating's kinda bad<br />for the ankles, you know?
2487852 2489251 Yeah.
2489320 2490981 You're a pretty good skater,<br />are you?
2492723 2495556 You know, like I was saying before<br />on the way over here.
2495626 2498561 Fightin' used to be tops<br />with me, but no more, you know?
2498629 2501291 All I wanted to do at a fight<br />was prove I was no bum...
2501365 2503731 that I had the stuff<br />to make a good pro, you know?
2503801 2505132 You never got the chance?
2505202 2509036 Hey, I ain't cryin' about it, 'cause I<br />still fight. I kinda do it like a hobby.
2509106 2511370 I tell you what the trouble is...<br />I'm a southpaw.
2511442 2514104 - What's a southpaw?<br />- A southpaw means you're left-handed.
2514178 2516669 And a southpaw<br />throws your timing off, you see.
2516747 2519079 Other guys it throws their timing off,<br />makes them look awkward.
2519149 2520878 Nobody wants to look awkward.
2520951 2523818 - You know where southpaw came from?<br />- Nine minutes!
2523888 2527221 I'll tell ya. A long time ago, this guy...<br />maybe a couple hundred years ago...
2527291 2530692 he was fightin' in the...<br />I think it was around Philadelphia...
2530761 2532422 and his arm... he was left-handed,
2532496 2535761 and his arm was facing towards<br />New Jersey, you see, and that's south.
2535833 2538666 So then that's why they<br />call 'em southpaw, you see?
2538736 2543435 Southpaw, South Jersey.<br />South Camden, southpaw.
2543507 2544667 You know what I mean?
2545876 2548367 I don't know. Things probably<br />worked out for the best, don't you think?
2548445 2550936 Never got a chance, though,<br />because you're left-handed, huh?
2551015 2553848 Well, that's absolutely true,<br />you know. Watch out.
2557721 2559712 I just dislocated my finger.
2560424 2563916 Look at that. No, wait.<br />Hey, it ain't your fault. Look.
2563994 2566986 See? Look, I had it...<br />it's an old wound, you see that?
2567064 2569897 Look. See?<br />Nothin'. It bends like that, see?
2569967 2571867 I originally done it...<br />look, push the button.
2571936 2573927 Bong. It works.<br />It ain't your fault.
2574004 2576666 - Look, I'm gonna show you somethin'.<br />- Seven minutes!
2576740 2579903 Yeah, I originally done it.<br />I carry pictures of all my fights.
2579977 2582775 I originally done it<br />in the Baby Crenshaw fight. See that?
2582846 2586043 Big Baby's about the size of an airplane.<br />I broke both my hands on his face.
2586116 2589279 I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,<br />don't you think? See how it works there?
2589353 2590513 Real nice.
2591989 2593479 Come on.<br />You having a good time?
2594325 2598318 I'll tell you... you could see<br />I ain't too graceful. I don't move well.
2598395 2601728 But I'll tell you, I can really swat, you<br />know what I mean? I can really hit hard.
2601799 2604962 But I'm a southpaw, and nobody wants<br />to fight no southpaw, know what mean?
2605035 2606093 Huh?
2610608 2612439 You know how I<br />got started in fightin'?
2613344 2614606 - Huh?<br />- No.
2615412 2617471 Am I talkin' too loud?
2617548 2619140 - No.<br />- Three minutes!
2619216 2623585 My father... he's, uh...<br />my old man, he was never too smart.
2623654 2626122 He says to me, "You weren't born<br />with much of a brain,
2626190 2628522 so you better start using<br />your body," right?
2628592 2629923 So I become a fighter.
2629994 2631222 Oh.
2631295 2633024 - You know what I mean?<br />- Yeah.
2633097 2634928 Why are you...<br />why are you laughin'?
2636100 2639160 My mother...<br />she said the opposite thing.
2639236 2641227 What'd she say?<br />What'd she say, the opposite?
2641972 2644440 She said you weren't born<br />with much of a body,
2644508 2646135 so you better develop your brain.
2646210 2647370 Did she say that?
2647444 2649674 Yo! Time!
2649747 2651908 Can I ask you a question?
2651982 2653313 Absolutely.
2654485 2657750 - Why do you wanna fight?<br />- 'Cause I can't sing or dance.
2657821 2659652 Eh, oh.
2659790 2661519 Don't fall! Don't fall!
2662359 2664850 Hey, that was terrific.<br />I'm pretty good at this.
2664928 2666259 You like the way I skate?
2666330 2669390 The last fight I had, I had<br />with this guy named Spider Rico.
2669466 2672094 He busted my head up.<br />You see that scar?
2672169 2675502 I'll tell ya...<br />things get pretty rough in the ring.
2684748 2687911 You know, with some people,<br />I'm very shy by nature, you know?
2688585 2689745 I suppose.
2693023 2695617 I say you're very shy<br />by nature, you know?
2697027 2698358 I suppose.
2699329 2702924 Ey! Ey.<br />The bum from the dark.
2703000 2704763 Get a job, you bum!
2705569 2708504 You know, some people think<br />that being shy is a disease,
2708572 2710403 but it don't bother me none.
2710474 2711873 It don't bother me, either.
2713610 2715669 Then why'd I bother<br />bringing it up, huh?
2715746 2717407 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.
2719283 2721444 I think we make<br />a real sharp couple of coconuts.
2721518 2723679 I'm dumb, you're shy.<br />What do you think, huh?
2726623 2729786 I don't understand why anybody<br />would wanna be a fighter.
2730461 2732622 Hey, you gotta be a moron.
2732696 2736291 You gotta be a moron to wanna be<br />a fighter, you know what I mean?
2736366 2739767 It's a racket where you're<br />almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
2739837 2743466 - I don't think you're a bum.<br />- Well, I'm at least half a bum, you know?
2743540 2745030 But I'll tell ya somethin'.
2746543 2749706 The worst thing about fightin'<br />is the mornin' after, you know?
2749780 2751509 - The mornin' after?<br />- I'll tell you. Yeah.
2751582 2755450 The mornin' after a fight, you're nothing<br />but a large wound, know what I mean?
2755519 2757248 Sometimes I got pains<br />all over me.
2757321 2761052 I feel like callin' a taxi to take me<br />from the bed into the bathroom.
2761125 2762888 Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt,
2762960 2766191 your face is all busted up,<br />your hands are swollen, you know?
2766263 2769096 Look at this face.<br />64 fights. Look at that nose.
2769166 2770497 See that nose?
2770567 2772967 That nose ain't never been broken.<br />64 fights.
2773036 2775869 I've had guys bustin' on it,<br />I had guys chewin' on it,
2775939 2779102 twistin' it, punchin' it...<br />I mean, whack! Boom!
2779176 2781838 These guys,<br />they hittin' my nose all the time.
2781912 2784904 Never broken. I'm very proud of that.<br />Isn't that rare? That's rare.
2785682 2788378 - Why do you do it if it hurts?<br />- Why do you think?
2790187 2793020 'Cause... you can't sing and dance.
2793090 2795581 Yeah, somethin' like that.<br />Somethin' like that.
2795659 2797149 Hey, you wanna come inside?
2800030 2801361 No. I gotta go.
2801431 2803422 Hey, come on.<br />Hey, I got some animals.
2803500 2807231 I got these rare... very rare<br />animals inside. Come on. Come on in.
2807304 2809169 No, no. I gotta go.
2809239 2812402 Well, I gotta go, too.<br />I gotta go to the bathroom. Come on.
2812476 2813738 Come on.
2813811 2816575 - No, I gotta go.<br />- Hey, look at this face.
2816647 2820048 Is that a face you could trust<br />or what? Huh? Is it?
2820117 2822642 They oughta stick this face<br />on a stamp. What do you think?
2824321 2826255 Come on. Come on in.
2831528 2833189 Yo. Come on.
2853517 2854677 Click.
2860457 2862186 Yo, Adrian, are you hungry?
2862259 2863658 No.
2863727 2868061 I got some things in there. If you<br />like soda, some donuts or something.
2868699 2872362 A couple cupcakes.<br />Huh? No?
2872436 2874495 I think I got<br />some chocolate in there.
2874571 2875560 No?
2883614 2884945 Hot in here, you know?
2887584 2889245 I could go for some music.
2895392 2896791 Yo, Adrian.
2896860 2900023 These are the exotic animals<br />I was tellin' you about.
2900097 2902122 These are my friends<br />Cuff and Link.
2902199 2903461 I sold 'em to you.
2903533 2905194 Sure, I know you sold them to me.
2905269 2907829 Remember you were workin'<br />at that pet shop, huh?
2907905 2910999 First day you was there, I came in<br />and bought both these animals, huh?
2911074 2912336 Yeah, I remember that.
2912409 2914138 I came and I bought this bowl
2914211 2916941 and I bought the, uh, bought<br />the animals themselves, some food,
2917014 2918948 the marbles that go<br />in the bottom there.
2919016 2920847 Remember?<br />Remember that mountain?
2920918 2924752 I had to get rid of that mountain, though,<br />'cause they kept falling over and flipping.
2928525 2931016 Yo, why don't you<br />come on over here and sit down?
2931929 2933590 Hmm?
2933664 2936258 It's a nice couch.<br />I don't know.
2938268 2941396 There's big bugs in there, you know.<br />It's safer over here.
2943473 2945304 You wanna sit down?
2951448 2954042 Uh, these...<br />these your parents?
2954117 2955982 Yeah, that's...<br />that's both of them there.
2956053 2957281 Is this you?
2957354 2959049 Yeah, that's me<br />when I was eight years old.
2959122 2961852 That's the Italian Stallion<br />when he was a baby.
2964361 2967694 Why don't you come on over<br />and make yourself comfortable? Relax.
2972869 2974359 Do you have a phone?
2974438 2975769 No, I ain't got no phone.
2975839 2979172 I had it pulled 'cause of people<br />calling all the time, and, uh,
2979242 2982871 who needs the aggravation,<br />right? The interruptions.
2982946 2984140 Who'd you wanna call?
2984214 2986808 I wanna let my brother<br />know where I am.
2988085 2989245 Why?
2991021 2992511 I think he might be worried.
2992589 2995422 Well, I'll call your brother,<br />if that's the problem.
2998328 3002424 Yo, Paulie, your sister's with me!<br />I'll call yous back later!
3002499 3003659 See ya!
3009806 3012138 What's the matter?<br />You don't like the room, do ya.
3012209 3013540 It's fine.
3013610 3015737 Well, it's only temporary,<br />you know.
3015812 3016972 It's not that.
3022319 3023809 What's the problem?
3023887 3025377 You don't like me?
3025455 3027787 You don't like the turtles?<br />What's the problem?
3027858 3030520 - I don't think I belong here.<br />- It's okay.
3033296 3034786 I don't belong here.
3035832 3039097 Well, you know, it's okay,<br />'cause you're my guest.
3040203 3043400 I don't...<br />know you well enough.
3043473 3047466 I've never been<br />in a man's apartment alone.
3048378 3051541 Well, I...<br />they're all the same. You know.
3056353 3058184 I'm not sure I know you well enough.
3060390 3062415 I don't feel comfortable.
3062492 3065655 Yo, Adrian, you know,<br />I ain't so comfortable either.
3067864 3069456 I should go.
3069533 3072525 Don't go, please.<br />Don't go. Don't go. Don't go.
3073870 3075030 Don't go.

3091421 3092911 Do me another favor?
3094424 3096085 Would you take off that hat?
3103033 3104967 I always knew you was pretty.
3106503 3108835 - Don't tease me.<br />- I'm not teasing you.
3112642 3114132 I ain't teasin' ya.
3115545 3118378 I just...<br />wanna kiss you.
3120784 3123184 You don't have to kiss me back<br />if you don't want.
3124054 3125715 But I wanna kiss you.
3198195 3200186 Worm, I heard<br />you had a fight comin' up.
3200263 3203096 Yeah, I'm gonna fight<br />next month.
3203166 3206431 That's good, man. You come down to<br />the gym, we'll see that you get in shape.
3206503 3207663 How's your weight?
3207737 3210069 - I weigh 175.<br />- Hey, Rock. How you doin', babe?
3210140 3212472 - Hey.<br />- Oh, Mick was lookin' for you up there.
3212542 3213600 - For me?<br />- Yeah.
3213677 3215076 - You sure?<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3215145 3218080 He was lookin' for you, Jack.<br />Get on up there and see him.
3218148 3219672 Yeah. It ain't locked, right?
3219749 3221842 - Yeah, yeah.<br />- All right, go on, man.
3236166 3237963 Hey, you got somethin' for me?
3238034 3240764 Yeah, there was some guy here<br />from Miles Jergens lookin' for you.
3240837 3242828 They need sparring partners<br />for Apollo Creed.
3242906 3244396 - You're puttin' me on.<br />- There's the card.
3244474 3246203 - When was he here?<br />- About an hour ago.
3246276 3248938 They're probably lookin' for<br />sparrin' partners for Creed, you know?
3249512 3252003 I said that before,<br />you dumb dago!
3253383 3256841 I've been comin' here for six years,<br />and six years you been stickin' it to me.
3256920 3258182 I wanna know how come.
3258255 3259552 You don't wanna know.
3259623 3261318 Yeah, I wanna know how come.
3261391 3263382 - You wanna know?<br />- I wanna know!
3263460 3265291 Okay, I'm gonna tell ya!
3265362 3268263 'Cause you had the talent<br />to become a good fighter,
3268331 3269730 and instead of that,
3269799 3274566 you became a leg-breaker<br />to some cheap, second-rate loan shark.
3274638 3275969 It's a livin'.
3276039 3277904 It's a waste of life!
3296259 3298090 Yes, may I help you?
3303366 3307530 Oh! You must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.<br />Mr. Jergens is expecting you.
3307604 3308935 Just a moment.
3313910 3316401 Mr. Rocky Balboa<br />to see you, sir.
3317113 3318171 Fine.
3318948 3321610 - Will you please go in, Mr. Balboa.<br />- Can I have that?
3321685 3323175 Oh, certainly.
3323253 3324413 Thanks.
3328591 3330252 Mr. Balboa.
3330860 3332691 How are you?<br />George Jergens.
3332762 3334354 Take a chair, please.
3334431 3335591 Thanks.
3337400 3339231 Mr. Balboa.
3339302 3341293 - Call me Rocky.<br />- Rocky.
3341371 3343362 Tell me, Rocky,<br />you got any representation?
3343440 3344930 You have a manager?
3345008 3346942 - No. It's just me.<br />- Oh.
3347911 3352245 Rocky, I've got a proposition<br />I'd like to make to you.
3352315 3355307 - Uh, sparrin'?<br />- Beg your pardon?
3355385 3357876 Well, it's just I know<br />you're lookin' for sparrin' partners,
3357954 3360218 and I just wanna say<br />I'm very available, you know.
3360290 3361348 I'm sure you are.
3361424 3363585 Absolutely. Sparrin' with the Champ<br />would be an honor.
3363660 3365321 - And you know what, Mr. Jergens?<br />- What?
3365395 3369058 I wouldn't take no cheap shots, either.<br />I'd really be a good sparring partner.
3369132 3370963 You don't understand me, Rocky.
3371835 3373666 My proposition is this...
3374537 3377028 Would you be interested<br />in fighting Apollo Creed
3377107 3379268 for the World<br />Heavyweight Championship?
3384381 3385712 No.
3385782 3387477 Listen, Rocky...
3388251 3390082 Apollo's seen you fight.
3390920 3394481 He likes you.<br />He wants to fight you.
3394557 3396491 Well, it's just that, you see, uh...
3396559 3399494 I fight in clubs, you know.<br />I'm really a ham-and-egger.
3399562 3402963 This guy... he's the best, and, uh,<br />it wouldn't be such a good fight.
3403032 3405364 But thank you very much,<br />you know.
3405435 3407300 I appreciate it and all that.
3407370 3412137 Rocky? Do you believe that America<br />is the land of opportunity?
3413009 3414601 Yeah.
3414677 3417009 Apollo Creed does.
3417080 3419014 And he's gonna prove it<br />to the whole world
3419082 3421983 by giving an unknown<br />a shot at the title.
3422051 3425020 And that unknown is you.
3425088 3426646 He picked you, Rocky.
3428091 3430582 Rocky, it's the chance<br />of a lifetime.
3431428 3433760 You can't pass it by.
3434864 3436263 What do you say?
3441337 3443396 <i>All right, fellas, fellas.</i><br /><i>That's enough pictures.</i>
3443473 3445236 <i>We wanna ask Apollo</i><br /><i>a few questions.</i>
3445308 3447970 <i>Apollo, how do you like</i><br /><i>the city of brotherly love?</i>
3448044 3451377 <i>Well, just being in Philadelphia</i><br /><i>makes me feel patriotic.</i>
3451448 3452938 <i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city</i>
3453016 3455280 <i>comin' up to me on the street</i><br /><i>wishing me the best.</i>
3455351 3458582 <i>I love my Philadelphia brothers,</i><br /><i>and I'm proud to be an American.</i>
3458655 3461488 <i>Champ, Apollo,</i><br /><i>why did you agree to fight a man</i>
3461558 3463992 <i>who has virtually</i><br /><i>no chance of winning?</i>
3464060 3466051 <i>Look, if history proves one thing,</i>
3466129 3469724 <i>American history proves</i><br /><i>that everybody's got a chance to win.</i>
3469799 3472734 <i>Didn't you guys ever hear</i><br /><i>of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>
3472802 3474793 <i>- Apollo, Apollo, Apollo.</i><br /><i>- Yes?</i>
3474871 3477203 <i>It is a coincidence</i><br /><i>that you're fighting a white man</i>
3477273 3479434 <i>on the most celebrated day</i><br /><i>in the country's history?</i>
3479509 3480771 <i>I don't know about that.</i>
3480844 3483039 <i>Is it a coincidence</i><br /><i>that he's fighting a black man</i>
3483112 3485273 <i>on the most celebrated day</i><br /><i>in the country's history?</i>
3485348 3486940 <i>Right on!</i><br /><i>Tell the truth, brother!</i>
3487016 3489746 <i>Listen, Apollo, tell me... how do you</i><br /><i>feel about your challenger?</i>
3489819 3491309 <i>- How do I feel about him?</i><br /><i>- Yeah.</i>
3491387 3493150 <i>What do you mean?</i><br /><i>Come here, Rock.</i>
3493223 3495885 <i>My main man,</i><br /><i>Rocky, ain't you Italian?</i>
3495959 3497221 <i>Yeah, I'm Italian.</i>
3497293 3499124 <i>Well, now, what does that mean?</i>
3499195 3502426 <i>It means if he can't fight,</i><br /><i>I bet he can cook.</i>
3502499 3503659 <i>All right, Rocky.</i>
3503733 3506395 Do me a favor.<br />His lungs... punch 'em out.
3506469 3507868 Paulie.
3507937 3511202 <i>But, Rocky, how do you expect</i><br /><i>to fight Apollo Creed?</i>
3511274 3513504 <i>Uh, well, geez, you know.</i><br /><i>Creed's the best.</i>
3513576 3515840 <i>I guess I'll have to do</i><br /><i>the best I can.</i>
3515912 3518312 <i>Tell me, Rocky,</i><br /><i>just between us...</i>
3518381 3521441 <i>where did you get the name</i><br /><i>"Italian Stallion"?</i>
3521518 3524851 <i>Oh... uh, I invented that</i><br /><i>about eight years ago</i>
3524921 3526354 <i>when I was eatin' dinner.</i>
3526422 3531121 <i>Rocky, now your payday</i><br /><i>will be $150.000.</i>
3531194 3532593 <i>Any comment?</i>
3534130 3537122 <i>You... you got no comment,</i><br /><i>Rocky, right? No comment.</i>
3537200 3538531 <i>Right.</i><br /><i>Thank you, Rocky.</i>
3538601 3541331 <i>Wait a minute. I just wanna</i><br /><i>say hi to my girlfriend, okay?</i>
3541404 3544862 <i>- I, uh...</i><br /><i>- Yo, Adrian! It's me, Rocky.</i>
3544941 3547933 <i>Look at this. Can you believe</i><br /><i>all this? They put a microphone on me.</i>
3548011 3549876 - You didn't.<br /><i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>
3549946 3554178 <i>- Quit pushin', man!</i><br /><i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>
3554250 3557845 Don't it matter he's makin' you<br />out a fool? I'd break his lips.
3557921 3561550 - He's taking cheap shots.<br />- It don't bother me none.
3561624 3566755 Yo, Rock... I guess you'll be looking<br />for people to help you out.
3566829 3571198 - Help in what?<br />- Keep you livin' the clean life.
3571267 3573497 I'll do okay. You know.
3573570 3575299 You need someone to help<br />with the exercise,
3575371 3579467 and someone standing by with a towel,<br />or runnin' errands. You know.
3579542 3582272 Hey, yo, Paulie, who cared<br />about me yesterday, huh? Nobody.
3582345 3584973 So I just think I'm<br />gonna train myself, you know.
3585048 3587107 Without such good people<br />around to help,
3587183 3589208 you don't have<br />such a good chance.
3589285 3592618 Einstein flunked out of school twice.
3592689 3594213 That so?
3594290 3595348 Yeah.
3595425 3598417 Beethoven was deaf.<br />Helen Keller was blind.
3598494 3600428 I think Rocky's<br />got a good chance.
3606736 3608397 Want me to get you<br />a beer, Paulie?
3608471 3612635 Hey, you lookin' to do a good deed?<br />Keep out of my freakin' life!
3613776 3615437 - What'd I do?<br />- Nothin'.
3615511 3619106 - What? Did I say something wrong?<br />- You didn't say nothin'. It's all right.
3619182 3622583 That's right... you didn't say nothin'!<br />Nothin' at all!
3624654 3626713 - I gotta go.<br />- Oh.
3627457 3629220 Where's the freakin' pretzels?!
3632829 3636822 I got the pretzels!<br />Hey! We ain't got any beer?
3637834 3639995 I thought you were supposed<br />to pick up some beer.
3648678 3651169 How'd you like hearing<br />your name on TV tonight?
3653282 3656115 I was shocked.<br />Why'd you do that?
3656185 3658016 Come on.<br />You're puttin' me on, right?
3658087 3659918 Absolutely.
3659989 3661650 What time should I expect you?
3661724 3663214 Oh, about 7:00.
3664227 3665216 Hey.
