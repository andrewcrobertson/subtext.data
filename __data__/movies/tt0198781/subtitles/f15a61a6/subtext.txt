1391616 1936622936 Psst. Anybody scaring in here?
3742035 7098849 You're still not listening!
6677288 1941908767 - I'm being attacked.<br />- No, I'm not attacking you.<br />I-I-I'm trying to be honest.
11331723 1546564049 She's not scared of you any more.
14345073 -436077270 Ever since that kid came in,<br />you've ignored everything I've said.
28105541 88500270 I was going for a snake-slash-ninja<br />approach with a little hissing.
29886767 70150997 You've destroyed this company.<br />Monsters, Incorporated is dead!
32188871 34941326 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.<br />Step aside, kid. We're in a...
40062382 -2089675618 - Boo's door!<br />- There it is!
44150468 1389449203 I'm sorry, Mike.<br />I'm sorry we're stuck out here.
46070105 -1882824895 I'm watching you, Wazowski.
52117400 1987348766 On my desk, Sulley.<br />The pink copies go to Accounting,<br />the fuchsia ones go to Purchasing...
53189542 -1263421458 - Sulley?<br />- Sulley?<br />- No! No, no.
53480264 -1788003736 I was on TV!
55050890 56738580 Come here, kid!
62782882 -1939202118 - 23-19! We have a 23-19!<br />- Halt!
66223485 68836415 - See you guys later. Take it easy.<br />- Thanks a lot.<br />- Bottoms up.
70150997 300352335 Where will everyone<br />get their scream now?
70594268 -1208479732 So I said, "If you talk to me<br />like that again, we're through!"
71107811 -1152748189 - Ooh, she's nuts.<br />- Always!
74095596 1904295820 - Oh.<br />- Come on!
75878222 80947356 Let her rip! Go!
76383128 -817034872 Goodbye, Boo.
82994698 -1793745302 A kid!
84761271 90010478 'Cause we both know it's true
88500270 1413668027 Oh, how many times<br />do I have to tell you?
98237416 1548567815 Uh, B-Boo... Um, Boo?
98519191 103427886 With a million or two
101691705 541955383 - I got a good view from here.<br />- A little lower.
112927620 -808715380 You'll have the child and the criminals<br />responsible for this whole mess.
120813575 71827575 Oh, for...<br />What did you do wrong this time?
121684122 -1991202878 No plan. I can't think.<br />Can't think. Flatlining.
128561210 -902613790 that now is the time to panic.
138074361 -618815639 Carefully matching every child<br />to their ideal monster...
139448025 -80838750 Roz, my tender, oozing blossom,<br />you're looking fabulous today.
143849946 2143853266 - We're walking.<br />- Walking?<br />- Yup.
144590574 149059548 That's the way it has to be.
149386778 154436148 Guess who!
155272302 -1059256698 None of it matters?<br />W-W-Wait a second.
155998269 1186196535 Halt! Stop him!
157038728 -260887272 Leave a door open and a child<br />could walk right into this factory...
162223091 -890515090 Without scream, we have no power.
167454675 417787514 Ah, poor guy. I understand.<br />It ain't easy being banished.
173101539 803300880 Put that thing back where it came from<br />or so help me
177187313 339411223 Our city is counting on you<br />to collect those children's screams.
184872893 115043893 Yes, yes, I'm coming. All right, then.<br />I'll see you this afternoon, James.
199403125 203416298 - Come on. It slides, it slides.<br />- Ooh, right, right, right.
200349504 -1369101496 No, don't touch those,<br />you little... Oh!
203145401 205071218 Okay. How about I sit here<br />until you fall asleep?
204215699 343663949 Be relaxed, be relaxed,<br />be relaxed.
206220136 208767616 Which means<br />the scare floor will be...
209090034 210765590 Oh, it's coming! It's coming!
214959426 -1044914574 Cheating?
223401740 224379672 Slumber party.
226778184 1362009755 Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.<br />Goodbye, Mr. Waternoose.
227852344 -559257656 Come on, fight that plaque.<br />Fight that plaque.<br />Scary monsters don't have plaque.
230219916 -914525084 - Okay, sweetheart.<br />- Think romantical thoughts.
232725378 -209381622 Mike.
233334974 858370755 - Okay, here I come.<br />- We're working for<br />a better tomorrow today!
243896607 317992203 Hey, look at that.<br />It's Randall. It's...
248141930 249089430 Let 'er rip!
251769447 776935884 And action.
252639936 -1434324064 Come on, pal,<br />if you start crying I'm gonna cry<br />and I'll never get through this.
254009586 -966813414 Hmm. Must've missed the memo.
259452954 -955927046 This is bad.<br />This is so very bad.
269126018 -1421482820 - Mike, this isn't Boo's door.<br />- Boo? What's Boo?
273196141 503395124 - But... But...<br />But h-how did... h-how did...<br />- You know what?
275110761 700147434 I-I just got us into a little place<br />called, um, Harryhausen's.
280886107 -653190893 Good morning, Roz,<br />my succulent little garden snail.
282223691 742619768 Uh-huh. And the fact that laughter<br />is ten times more powerful than scream<br />had nothing to do with it.
282806045 310911991 What was that? You're trying to<br />scare the kid, not lull it to sleep.
287098219 1337428578 Funny, right, huh? See, with the...<br />These are the jokes, kid.
296925338 -880981662 So wait here while<br />I get its card key.
298079252 -753511748 No, the fuchsia ones go to Purchasing,<br />the goldenrod ones go to Roz...
298992617 302740946 Finish him off!
300352335 304769182 The energy crisis will only<br />get worse because of you!
308156378 516158378 - Good night, sweetheart.<br />- Good night, Mom.
313618192 315805728 Hey, you're good.
313924398 -1387114602 Hey, genius, y-you wanna know<br />why I bought the car, huh?
314913227 1850144154 Wait a minute. Randall? That cheater.<br />He's trying to boost his numbers.
320295642 585330949 - You know, pal, she's the one.<br />That's it. She is the one.<br />- I'm happy for you.
320356560 1455587960 Using mainly spoons,<br />we dig a tunnel under the city...
322866507 1373195751 I tried to run from it,<br />but it picked me up with its mind<br />powers and shook me like a doll.
327504423 1167769449 when you intercepted<br />that child, Mr. Sullivan.
330674297 332240626 What bag?
333231841 1573497033 You and me together
333956408 337639536 Twenty-three-nine...
337744472 -779212528 I wouldn't have nothin'<br />if I didn't have
348292472 349259248 Attention. We have a new scare leader...<br />Randall Boggs.
353079963 357789494 I tell ya, it's great to be here<br />in your room. Where you from?<br />91
2892679 -709049321 - Sorry.<br />- We're never gonna work<br />in Hollywood again.<br />92
4188362 1309486454 Sullivan! Don't do it.<br />93
5184292 230219916 Not for Googley Bear. I will see you<br />at quittin' time and not a minute later.<br />94
5623607 9523822 What a plan.<br />Simple, yet insane!<br />95
15088818 -1084654182 No. No way.<br />96
18449982 -972901018 Always... No.<br />97
18465510 1703631026 Hey, thanks, guys.<br />That was a close one.<br />98
22809597 23719127 Hmm. First time in a month.<br />99
24761199 214959426 It never would've gotten out<br />if you hadn't been cheating last night.<br />100
25488293 930786025 We're just going through<br />a rough time, sir. Everyone knows<br />you're gonna get us through it.<br />101
26907656 29982216 I-I told them this.<br />102
29859394 30963844 An entire scare floor out of commission.<br />What else can go wrong?<br />103
33708217 37713707 - There he is. Hurry up! Hurry up!<br />- Give me your hand.<br />104
37431881 41744530 Sullivan? Sullivan!<br />Give me the child!<br />105
39232117 459626607 - No, no, no, sir, you don't understand.<br />- Ah, now, show these monsters<br />how it's done.<br />- What? No, no. I ca... I ca... Sir. Sir!<br />106
46882371 1142115585 - Don't have to say it<br />- I'm gonna anyway!<br />107

48553761 533719487 - Sure, he's handsome,<br />I mean, for like a big, rugged...<br />- Hi, guys.<br />109

57787514 -1653963486 Uh, take my buddy Bigfoot.<br />When he was banished, he fashioned<br />an enormous diaper out of poison ivy.<br />111
62963411 -649037589 The future is bright<br />at Monsters, Incorporated.<br />112
64458524 -1175849476 Ooh, bear! Ooh!<br />Ooh, he's a happy bear!<br />113
74492654 1759658614 Okay, people, take a break.<br />114

83076000 -1243648000 Now, before we do anything else...<br />116
83502707 1178735318 Go get 'em, Googley Bear.<br />117
