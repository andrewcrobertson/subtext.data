211269 213158 And leaving the door open<br />is the worst mistake
213235 215828 any employee can make<br />because...?
215846 218567 Um... it could let in a draft?
218619 219995 It could let in
220004 222021 a child!
222068 223252 Oh! Mr. Waternoose!
223293 227903 There is nothing more toxic<br />or deadly than a human child.
227936 230080 A single touch could kill you!
230129 232049 Leave a door open
232127 234944 and a child could walk<br />right into this factory!
234996 236885 Right into the monster world!
236930 238243 I won't go<br />in a kid's room!
238284 239213 You can't make me!

1099139 1100419 We got to shut down<br />for a half-hour
1100493 1101549 and reset the system.
1101590 1104118 An entire scare floor<br />out of commission.
1104135 1106087 What else can go wrong?
1107390 1109726 Oh... what a day.
1109775 1111535 We're just going through<br />a rough time, sir.
1111578 1113659 Everyone knows you're going<br />to get us through it.
1113707 1115564 Tell that to the<br />board of directors.
1115577 1117081 ( slurping )
1117122 1118723 James, this company
1118767 1121456 has been in my family<br />for three generations.
1121539 1124515 I would do anything to<br />keep it from going under.
1124567 1125848 Oh, so would I, sir.
1125889 1127266 Well...
1127308 1129965 Say, I could use your help<br />with something.
1130014 1131487 Anything, sir.
1131498 1133514 You see, we've hired<br />some new scare recruits
1133591 1135448 and frankly, they're...<br />they're, um... uh...
1135493 1137030 Inexperienced?
1137040 1138544 Oh, they stink!
1138555 1139836 Uh-huh.
1139845 1141669 And I thought maybe<br />you might come by tomorrow
1141778 1143218 and give them a demonstration.
1143260 1146269 Show them what it takes<br />to be a top scarer, huh?
1146322 1149362 I'II start out with the old<br />Waternoose jump-and-growl.
1149416 1150951 ( growling loudly )
1150996 1152884 Ha! Oh, oh, yes!

1174361 1175385 Another day like this
1175424 1176672 and that scare record's<br />in the bag.
1176680 1177609 That's right, baby!

1187188 1188468 What's on your agenda?
1188509 1190078 I'm going to head home<br />and work out some more.
1190153 1192073 Again? You know, there's<br />more to life than scaring.
1192086 1193175 ( sniff'<br />ng )
1193182 1194462 Whew. Hey, can I<br />borrow your odorant?
1194536 1195977 Yeah. I got, uh...
1195987 1198803 smelly garbage or old dumpster.
1198855 1199783 You got low tide?

1200788 1201717 How about wet dog?
1201754 1202715 Yep. Stink it up.
1204462 1205391 ( growling )
1205428 1206709 You know, I am so romantic
1206783 1208415 sometimes I think<br />I should just marry myself.
1208426 1209675 Give me a<br />break, Mike.
1209683 1212179 What a night of romance<br />I got ahead of me.
1212229 1213413 Tonight is about me
1213422 1215215 and Celia.
1215227 1217787 Ooh, the love boat<br />is about to set sail.

1231695 1233328 correctly... for once.
1234404 1238020 Your stunned silence<br />is very reassuring.
1238110 1239966 Oh, no. My scare reports--<br />I left them on my desk
1239978 1241931 and if I'm not at the restaurant<br />in five minutes

1523461 1524357 ( faint squeal of fear )
1524428 1525516 No, no, I like<br />it this length.
1525588 1526484 ( sighs of relief )
1526555 1527995 I like everything<br />about you.
1528038 1529094 Just the other day
1529100 1530380 someone asked me who I thought
1530454 1532278 the most beautiful monster was<br />in all of Monstropolis.
1532325 1533285 You know what I said?
1533290 1534666 What did you say?
1534741 1535637 I said...
1535707 1538075 --Sulley?<br />--Sulley?
1538125 1539117 No! No, no.
1539189 1540437 That's not<br />what I was going to say.
1540510 1541950 Mike, you're not making sense.
1541992 1543560 SULLEY:<br />Hi, guys!
1543668 1545012 What a coincidence,<br />running into you here!
1545087 1546560 Uh, I'm just going<br />to order something to go.
1546600 1547465 Michael...
1547568 1548432 Sulley!
1548535 1549624 I wonder what's good here.
1549632 1551103 Get out of here.<br />You're ruining everything.
1551112 1552232 I went back to get<br />your paperwork
1552273 1553201 and there was a door.
1553240 1554200 What?
1555560 1557129 ( rattling )
1557171 1558100 A door?!
1558140 1559036 Randall was in it.
1559040 1560001 Wait a minute.<br />Randall?
1560040 1561001 That cheater!
1561039 1562799 He's trying<br />to boost his numbers!
1562811 1564092 There's something else.
1564134 1565061 What?!
1565100 1566284 Ook-lay in the ag-bay.
1566325 1567254 What?!
1567290 1568219 Look in the bag.
1568226 1569955 What bag?
1569999 1572080 ( sighs )
1573157 1574950 ( gasps )
1574993 1576626 ( giggling )
1576638 1577854 Oh!
1577895 1579080 They don't have<br />anything I like here.
1579088 1580015 So take care, Celia!
1580086 1581046 Excuse me, sir.
1581053 1582013 What's going on?
1582020 1583428 Celia, please try<br />to understand.
1584694 1586262 I have to do something!
1586339 1587235 Michael?
1587306 1588810 PHOTOGRAPHER:<br />On three.
1588853 1590005 One... two....
1590044 1590973 ( squeals and giggles )
1591012 1592900 ( screaming )
1592946 1593875 A kid!
1593880 1595064 Boo!
1595073 1596738 ( all screaming )
1599358 1600607 A kid!
1602646 1604374 There's a kid here--<br />a human kid!
1604419 1606052 ( exclaiming in baby talk )
1606095 1607984 Oh!
1607997 1609341 CELIA:<br />Googley Bear!
1610606 1612686 ( yelling )
1614443 1615819 ( blows raspberry )
1615860 1616949 Come on!
1618921 1621097 ( monsters screaming in terror )
1621113 1622361 MIKE:<br />Let's get out of here!
1622403 1624611 CDA HELICOPTER PILOT:<br />Please remain calm.
1624723 1625748 This is not a drill.
1625786 1627611 ( siren wailing,<br />tires screeching )
1627623 1629575 CDA AGENT 1 :<br />We have an 835 in progress.
1629589 1630549 Please advise.
1630556 1632765 Michael? Michael?
1632812 1633900 Oh, Celia.
1633908 1635444 --Please come with me.<br />--Ow. Stop pushing.
1635487 1637344 Hey, get your hands off<br />my Schmoopsie-poo!
1637389 1639597 Building clear.<br />Ready for decontamination.
1639676 1642557 Well, I don't think that date<br />could have gone any worse.
1642642 1643634 ( explosion )
1643706 1645243 ( electrical buzzing )
1649217 1650944 If witnesses are to be believed
1650989 1653133 there has been<br />a child security breach
1653149 1655390 for the first time<br />in monster history.
1655436 1656813 We can neither confirm nor deny
1656855 1658903 the presence of a human child<br />here tonight.
1658916 1660549 Well, a kid flew right over me
1660658 1662866 and blasted a car<br />with its laser vision!
1662881 1665154 I tried to run from it,<br />but it picked me up
1665234 1667634 with its mind powers<br />and shook me like a doll!
1667684 1669508 It's true!<br />I saw the whole thing!
1669521 1672113 It is my<br />professional opinion
1672164 1674948 that now is the time<br />to... panic!
1675032 1676280 Oh-oh.
1676288 1678336 ( both yelling )
1678383 1679568 Oh, it's coming!
1679606 1680855 It's coming!
1680865 1682690 ( giggling ):<br />Boo!
1682703 1683887 ( both screaming )
1683894 1685782 ( distant sirens wailing )
1686828 1688460 ( delighted cry )
1688535 1690231 ( yelling )
1690243 1691652 No, no, no, no, no!
1691663 1692782 Come here, kid.
1692822 1693782 Whee.
1695948 1697389 No, don't touch those,<br />you little...!
1697430 1698359 Oh, now
1698397 1699421 those were alphabetized.
1699461 1700550 It's okay, it's all right.
1700589 1701901 As long as it doesn't<br />come near us
1701910 1702871 we're going to be okay.
1702877 1703837 ( sneezes )
1703844 1704964 ( screams )
1705777 1706962 ( yelling in pain )
1707002 1708282 ( whimpering in fear )
1708324 1709476 Wanna ride on it!
1710934 1711765 Da, da-da.
1711772 1712733 Da-da-da.
1712739 1713763 Oh, y-you like this?
1713802 1714730 Fetch!
1714737 1715697 ( giggles )
1715703 1717272 ( gasps )
1717315 1718660 Hey, hey, that's it!
1718701 1720590 No one touches<br />little Mikey!
1720635 1722396 ( whining )
1722504 1724328 Mike, give her the bear.
1726017 1726978 Oh, no.
1726984 1728745 ( piercing scream )
1728821 1730166 ( electrical buzzing )
1731882 1734795 ( screaming and crying<br />continue )
1734913 1737794 ( buzzing continues )
1739875 1740867 ( exclaiming in fear )
1740874 1742154 Make it stop, Sulley!
1742228 1743380 Make it stop!
1743454 1744637 Look!<br />See the bear?
1744677 1745701 Ooh, nice bear.
1745806 1746671 ( screams )
1746773 1747796 Sulley!
1747837 1748893 See?
1748899 1750083 Ooh, bear, ooh.
1750092 1751788 Oh, he's<br />a happy bear.
1751897 1753401 * He's not crying,<br />neither should you *
1753444 1754820 * Or we'II be<br />in trouble *
1754862 1755918 * 'Cause they're gonna find us *
1755926 1758007 * So please stop crying *
1758053 1759077 * Right now. *
1759084 1760205 Good, good, Sulley.<br />Keep it up.
1760244 1761461 You're doing great.
1761597 1762782 * Ooh, the happy bear,<br />he has no... *
1762790 1763973 ( screaming )
1764047 1765295 She touched me!
1765335 1766327 Sulley, the bear!
1766399 1767264 The bear!
1767367 1768327 Give her the...
1768334 1769806 Whoa!
1772298 1773642 ( giggles )
1773716 1775061 ( screaming with laughter )
1775133 1776893 ( electrical buzzing<br />grows louder )
1776939 1777963 ( light bulb shatters )
1778034 1778962 ( giggles )
1779065 1780602 What was that?
1780644 1781605 ( thumping )
1781643 1782572 I have no idea
1782609 1784371 but it would be<br />really great
1784384 1785952 if it didn't<br />do it again.
1786026 1787115 ( giggles )
1787122 1788530 Shh, shh, shh.
1788606 1789693 Shh...
1789701 1790726 shh.
1790764 1792493 Shh...
1801239 1802423 Ah!
1805848 1807000 How could I do this?
1807040 1808448 How could I be so stupid?
1808491 1810026 This could destroy<br />the company.
1810134 1810998 The company?
1811100 1812444 Who cares<br />about the company?!
1812520 1813416 What about us?
1813452 1814893 That thing is<br />a killing machine!
1815000 1816985 * La-la-la-la-la-la *
1817030 1818951 I bet it's just waiting<br />for us to fall asleep
1818996 1820085 and then wham!
1820125 1821853 Oh, we're easy prey,<br />my friend-- easy prey.
1821896 1823753 We're sitting targets.
1823799 1824695 Okay, look, I think
1824734 1826046 I have a plan here.
1826118 1829223 Using mainly spoons, we dig<br />a tunnel under the city
1829343 1831167 and release it into the wild.
1831179 1833260 Spoons.
1833307 1834683 That's it, I'm out of ideas.
1834724 1836164 We're closed.<br />Hot air balloon?
1836174 1837839 Too expensive.<br />Giant slingshot?
1837916 1838812 Too conspicuous.
1838881 1839905 Enormous wooden horse?<br />Too Greek!
1839978 1843146 ( speaking baby talk )
1843200 1845185 No plan. No plan.
1845199 1847503 Can't think.<br />Can't think.
1847550 1848511 Flatlining.
1848582 1849478 Uh, Mike?
1849518 1851694 I think she's getting tired.
1851741 1853565 Well, then<br />why don't you
1853642 1856042 find someplace<br />for it to sleep?
1856059 1857659 While I think of a plan!
1859186 1860817 Are you sleepy?
1860862 1862814 You want to sleep?
1862860 1863948 ls that what you want?
1864021 1865300 Huh?
1873302 1877047 ( crunching )
1877073 1878385 Okay, all right.
1878393 1879930 I'm making a nice little area<br />for you to...
1880005 1881093 ( giggling )
1881134 1882702 No. Hey, hey,<br />that's my bed!
1882745 1884184 You're going to get<br />your germs all over it.
1886289 1887249 ( sighing ):<br />Fine.
1887321 1889626 My chair is<br />more comfortable anyway.
1889707 1891019 ( yells )
1891027 1891987 What?
1891994 1893179 ( speaking fearfully )
1894894 1895822 it's just a closet.
1895862 1896918 Will you go to sleep?
1900663 1902359 Hey, that looks like Randall.
1902438 1904806 Randall's your monster.
1904853 1907733 You think he's going<br />to come through the closet
1907786 1908714 and scare you.
1908754 1910706 Oh, boy, how do I explain this?
1910785 1911745 Uh, it's empty.
1911750 1913158 --See?<br />--Ah!
1913200 1914864 No monster in here.
1919650 1921154 Well, now there is
1922037 1924598 but I'm not going to scare you.
1924707 1925731 I'm off-duty.
1929596 1930908 Okay.
1930947 1935204 How about I sit here,<br />until you fall asleep?
1937220 1938372 Go ahead.
1938440 1939817 Go to sleep.
1939857 1940785 Now.
1940822 1943670 Now... go.
1943716 1944964 Uh, you...
1944971 1946188 go...
1946289 1947346 to...
1947382 1948375 sleep.
1948444 1949948 ( imitating snoring )
1949957 1951366 ( giggles )
1954653 1956350 ( sighs in relief )
1972663 1975032 ( door creaks softly )
1980641 1982210 Hey, Mike,<br />this might sound crazy
1982281 1984138 but I don't think<br />that kid's dangerous.
1984210 1986323 Really? Well, in that case,<br />let's keep it.
1986333 1988381 I always wanted a pet<br />that could kill me!
1988424 1989705 Now, look.
1989742 1991439 What if we just put<br />her back in her door?
1991447 1992920 What?
1992929 1993921 Mike, think about it.
1993924 1995492 If we send her back,<br />it's like it never happened.
1995532 1996524 Everything goes back to normal.
1996562 1997491 Is that a joke?
1997527 1998583 Tell me you're joking.
2000165 2002502 Sulley, I'd like to think<br />that, given the circumstances
2002544 2004241 I have been extremely<br />forgiving up to now
2004281 2005529 but that is a horrible idea!
2005535 2006784 What are we going to do?
2006790 2008646 March right out into<br />public with that thing?
2008686 2011183 Then I guess we just waltz<br />right up to the factory, right?
2011839 2014304 I can't believe we are waltzing<br />right up to the factory.
2014348 2017356 Sulley, a mop, a couple of<br />lights and some chair fabric
2017405 2019005 are not going<br />to fool anyone!
2019045 2021254 Just think about<br />a few names, will you?
2021328 2023505 Loch Ness, Bigfoot,<br />the Abominable Snowman--
2023515 2026011 they all got one thing<br />in common, pal-- banishment.
2026023 2027400 We could be next!
2027408 2028624 Don't panic--<br />we can do this.
2028629 2029717 Hey, how you doing, Frank?
2029722 2030778 Hey, guys.
2030783 2031839 Everything's going
2031879 2033127 to be okay.
2033132 2034124 ( gasping )
2034129 2036049 ( equipment buzzing loudly )
2037796 2039493 Number One wants this place<br />dusted for prints.
2039533 2040781 Careful with that.
2040852 2042196 I got a good view from here.
2042202 2043867 A little lower.
2043876 2046403 This was recovered<br />at the scene.
2046544 2047376 Don't panic.<br />Don't panic!
2047510 2048439 Don't tell me<br />not to panic.
2048443 2049370 Just keep it together.
2049375 2050368 Everything is not okay!
2050435 2051396 LITTLE GIRL:<br />Boo.
2051401 2052873 ...could be contaminated.
2052914 2054033 Gentlemen, safety
2054038 2055254 is our number one concern.
2055260 2056541 If there's anything that...
2056580 2057604 not now, not now.
2057609 2059146 Oh, hello, little one.
2059185 2060880 Where did you come from?
2060888 2061913 Mr. Waternoose!
2061984 2063617 Ah, James!<br />ls this one yours?
2063687 2067240 Actually, that's my, uh,<br />cousin's sister's daughter, sir.
2067290 2069051 Yeah, it's, uh...
2069060 2071780 ''Bring an Obscure<br />Relative to Work Day.''
2071825 2073298 Hmm, must have missed the memo.
2073336 2074489 Well, listen, James
2074496 2076928 why don't you stop by<br />the simulator after lunch today
2076972 2078667 and give us<br />that scare demonstration
2078676 2079861 we talked about, huh?
2079930 2081370 Oh, oh, sir, uh....
2081443 2082722 Excuse me,<br />Mr. Waternoose?
2082729 2083978 Yes, yes, I'm coming.
2084048 2086288 All right then, I'II see<br />you this afternoon, James.
2086332 2088476 That is, if these gentlemen<br />haven't shut us down.
2088551 2089575 Oh, boy.
2089580 2090541 Oh, a scare demo.
2090608 2091601 Well, that is great.
2091671 2092696 Why am I<br />the last to know?
2092699 2094875 We can bring your cousin's<br />sister's daughter along.
2094984 2095944 She'II be a big hit!
2095948 2097037 ( equipment buzzing loudly )
2097105 2098161 Halt!
2098200 2099160 ( yelling )
2099230 2100221 Stop him!
2100291 2101922 Hold him down.
2105470 2106622 Come on,<br />the coast is clear.
2106658 2109187 Okay, all we have to do<br />is get rid of that thing.
2109264 2111281 So, wait here while<br />I get its card key.
2111322 2112539 But she can't stay here.
2112545 2113761 This is the men's room.
2113801 2116425 That is the weirdest thing<br />you have ever said.
2116534 2117750 It's fine. It's okay.
2117853 2118941 Look, it loves it here!
2118945 2120034 It's dancing with joy!
2120070 2121319 Uh, uh, uh, uh.
2121391 2123375 I'II be right back<br />with its door key.
2123384 2124632 ( laughs )
2124671 2127167 That's a cute little<br />dance you've got.
2127212 2128812 It almost looks<br />like you've got to...
2128916 2130453 ( whining )
2130493 2132382 Oh.
2133033 2135306 ( singing in baby talk )
2139885 2141774 ( singing stops )
2141814 2145463 Uh, are you<br />done in there?
2145481 2146762 ( squeals )
2146769 2149200 Ah! Sorry. Sorry.
2149211 2151869 ( singing )
2157864 2160552 ( toilet flushes )
2160565 2162709 Okay, you<br />finished now, right?
2162785 2164001 Hello?
2165390 2166319 ( yells )
2168511 2169727 Boo.
2169733 2171078 ( giggles )
2171115 2173324 ( sighs )
2173368 2174904 ( giggling )
2177001 2178825 ( chuckles )
2178868 2181588 Where did she go?
2181698 2183906 Oh, did she disappear?
2183916 2186380 Did she turn invisible?
2186426 2188090 ( giggling softly )
2188130 2189602 I just have no idea.
2190994 2192434 Gotcha!
2192472 2195097 Boo.
2195110 2196390 ( giggles )
2196396 2198157 Hey, you're good.
2199613 2200989 ( sighs )
2203762 2207092 Be relaxed,<br />be relaxed, be relaxed.
2207108 2208643 Roz, my tender,<br />oozing blossom
2208683 2210188 you're looking<br />fabulous today.
2210195 2211412 Is that a new haircut?
2211482 2212506 Come on, tell me.
2212543 2213792 It's a new haircut,<br />isn't it?
2213894 2214854 That's got to be<br />a new haircut.
2214891 2215851 New makeup?<br />You've had a lift.
2215889 2217232 You've had a tuck.<br />You've had something.
2217238 2219095 Something has been<br />inserted in your skin
2219137 2220321 that makes you look like...
2220359 2221991 ( sighs )
2222031 2223247 Listen, I need a favor.
2223350 2225206 Randall was working<br />late last night
2225215 2226527 out on the scare floor.
2226533 2229222 I really need the key<br />for the door he was using.
2229268 2230869 Well, isn't that nice?
2230940 2233149 But guess what?
2233161 2236457 You didn't turn in<br />your paperwork last night.
2236537 2238361 He didn't... I...<br />no paperwork?
2238403 2240356 This office is now closed.
2241393 2242962 ( Mike screams in pain )
2243549 2245374 Ready or not, here I come!
2245382 2247238 I'm getting warmer.
2247249 2248433 Any second now.
2248502 2251543 Fee fi fo...
2251591 2252679 What are you doing?!
2252715 2254443 I-I'm looking<br />for the kid.
2254486 2255574 You lost it?!
2255610 2256859 No, no, she was just....
2256929 2258594 ( squeals )
2258665 2259818 Here she is.
2259857 2260817 ( whining )
2260885 2262165 Hey, what's the matter?
2262203 2264891 RANDALL:<br />I already told your buddies<br />I haven't seen anything.
2264938 2266346 CDA AGENT:<br />All right, carry on.
2274264 2275353 ( splashing )
2276164 2277412 Randall!<br />Thank goodness!
2277482 2279787 What are we going to do<br />about the child?
2279830 2280950 Shh!
2282146 2284067 Shh, shh, shh.
2288932 2290790 ( door slams open )
2294626 2295650 ( door slams open )
2300447 2302399 The front page!<br />It's on the front page.
2302440 2304233 The child--<br />the one you were after.
2304242 2305330 Will you be quiet?!
2305335 2307448 Don't you think I'm aware<br />of the situation?
2307460 2309220 I was up all night<br />trying to find it.
2309324 2310701 I did a simple<br />calculation
2310708 2313140 factoring in the size<br />of the sushi restaurant.
2313215 2314656 The child<br />may have escaped!
2314728 2316265 Yeah, well, until<br />we know for sure
2316273 2318449 we're going to act like nothing<br />happened, understand?
2318523 2320188 You just get the machine<br />up and running.
2320196 2321348 I'II take care of the kid.
2321384 2323529 And when I find whoever<br />let it out, they're dead!
2323541 2324918 Oh!
2326404 2327716 Why are you still here?
2327722 2328874 Come on, go!
2328879 2330063 Move! Now!
2330102 2331478 FUNGUS:<br />Ow, ow! I'm not here.
2331518 2333566 SULLEY ( whispering ):<br />They're gone.
2333609 2335113 ( squeaking and splashing )
2335151 2336880 LITTLE GIRL:<br />Eww.
2337339 2338076 MIKE:<br />This is bad.
2338080 2339552 This is so very bad.
2339559 2341127 What were they talking<br />about a machine?
2341167 2342159 Who cares? Oh!
2342260 2343701 Look, don't panic--<br />all we have to do
2343738 2345371 is call her door down<br />and send her home.
2345380 2346724 You're right,<br />you're right.
2346763 2348940 We're just two regular joes<br />on our way to work.
2348950 2350262 We will blend right in.
2350269 2351677 Top of the mornin', fellas!
2351749 2353124 Hey, what's<br />shakin', bacon?
2353131 2354220 Did you lose weight?
2354290 2355282 Or a limb?
2355287 2356535 You have<br />her card key, right?
2356541 2357822 Of course<br />I have her card key.
2357828 2359236 I told you<br />I'd get her card key.
2359275 2360396 I went and got<br />her card key
2360433 2362416 and now I have her card key.
2363456 2365601 Okay, here we go.
2365612 2366731 Take care of yourself.
2366770 2368818 Try not to run<br />through any more closets.
2368892 2370044 ( giggles )
2370114 2372547 Mike, that's<br />not her door.
2372560 2374128 What are you<br />talking about?
2374135 2375735 Of course it's her door.<br />It's her door.
2375743 2377792 No, her door was white<br />and it had flowers on it.
2377801 2379593 No. It must have been<br />dark last night
2379602 2380850 because this is its door.
2380890 2382010 ( polka music playing )
2382047 2383039 Hey, you hear that?
2383077 2384998 Sounds like<br />fun in there!
2385039 2386416 Okay, send me a postcard, kid.
2386486 2387894 That's Mike Wazowski, care of
2387933 2390141 22 Mike-Wazowski-<br />you-got-your-life-back lane.
2390151 2391752 Mowki Kowski.
2391793 2393457 Very good.<br />Now bon voyage!
2393530 2394907 Bye-bye!<br />Come on.
2394944 2396544 Look at the stick.<br />See the stick?
2396552 2397769 Go get the stick!<br />Go fetch.
2397808 2399729 Mike, this isn't<br />Boo's door.
2399769 2401050 Boo? What's Boo?
2401120 2403457 That's what I decided<br />to call her.
2403468 2404909 Is there a problem?
2404979 2406676 Sulley, you're not<br />supposed to name it.
2406685 2408989 Once you name it, you start<br />getting attached to it!
2409033 2410025 Now put that thing
2410126 2412910 back where it came from,<br />or so help me...
2416430 2417518 Oh, hey!
2417524 2420149 We're rehearsing a scene<br />for the upcoming company play
2420161 2422465 called Put That Thing<br />Back Where lt Came From
2422542 2423790 Or So Help Me%
2423861 2424821 ( Mike laughing )
2424825 2425881 It's a musical!
2425918 2427903 * Put that thing back where<br />it came from or so help me *
2428010 2429066 * Bom-bom, bom-bom,<br />bom-bom... *
2429135 2430063 * So help me,<br />so help me. *
2430196 2431381 And cut!
2431387 2432475 We're still<br />working on it.
2432513 2433473 It's a work<br />in progress
2433509 2435077 but, hey,<br />we need ushers.
2435150 2436174 Sulley, I've had enough.
2436243 2437939 Now say good-bye to...<br />where'd it go?
2437947 2438940 What'd you do with it?
2438977 2439937 ( gasps ):<br />Where is she?
2440007 2440999 I don't believe it.
2441068 2442316 She got away<br />from you again?!
2442354 2443410 Well, that is just...
2443415 2444503 Wait a minute.
2444542 2446014 The sun is coming up.
2446054 2447270 This is perfect!
2447373 2449133 She's gone!
2449173 2450485 Hey, hey, hey, hey.
2450491 2451451 Where are you going?
2451521 2452737 Sulley, please,<br />don't blow this.
2452808 2454664 Not when we're so close<br />to breaking the record.
2454738 2455986 Somebody else<br />will find the kid.
2455992 2457335 It'II be their problem,<br />not ours!
2457376 2458240 She's out of our hair!
2459272 2460681 What are you<br />two doing?
2460688 2462768 They're rehearsing a play.
2462779 2464380 * She's out of our hair! *
2464387 2465474 Can it, Wazowski!
2465479 2468424 So, what do you think of that<br />kid getting out, Sullivan?
2468471 2469624 Pretty crazy, huh?
2469727 2471487 Oh, yeah, crazy.
2471495 2472615 Word on the street is the kid's
2472653 2473741 been traced back<br />to this factory.
2473746 2474995 You haven't seen anything,<br />have you?
2475034 2476506 Uh, well, uh...
2476544 2477664 No, no way!
2477703 2479942 But if it was<br />an inside job
2479987 2481812 I'd put my money<br />on Waxford.
2481852 2482973 Waxford?
2483010 2484258 Yeah, the one<br />at station six.
2484297 2485801 You know, he's got<br />them shifty eyes.
2485872 2486993 Hey, Waxford!
2487127 2488215 Sulley!
2488318 2489758 CELIA:<br />Michael Wazowski!
2491501 2492589 ( whimpers )
2492594 2494771 last night was one<br />of the worst nights
2494782 2496350 of my entire life,<br />bar none!
2496358 2497830 ( hissing )
2498770 2499954 I thought<br />you cared about me.
2499993 2500985 Honey, please.
2501022 2503294 Schmoopsie, I thought<br />you liked sushi.
2503304 2504809 CELIA:<br />Sushi? Sushi?!!
2504849 2507378 You think this is<br />about sushi?!
2512826 2513978 Wazowski!
2514049 2515586 Michael! Mike...
2515688 2516936 Men.
2517265 2518032 ( panting )
2518036 2519413 Breathe. Keep breathing.
2527718 2529287 Whew.
2529295 2530415 Yikes!
2530420 2532212 Where's the kid?
2532251 2533884 Kid? What kid?
2533926 2535366 lt's here in<br />the factory, isn't it?
2535437 2536620 You're not<br />pinning this on me.
2536659 2537875 It never would<br />have gotten out
2537881 2539577 if you hadn't been<br />cheating last night!
2539586 2540611 Cheating?
2541966 2543567 Cheating. Right.
2543606 2547383 Okay, I think I know how<br />to make this all go away.
2547466 2551339 What happens when the whistle<br />blows in five minutes?
2551391 2553856 Uh... I get a time-out?
2553898 2556555 Everyone goes to lunch!
2556633 2559802 Which means the scare floor<br />will be...?
2561040 2562192 Painted?
2562262 2565142 Empty! It'II be<br />empty, you idiot!
2565189 2566885 You see that clock?
2566926 2569102 When the big hand<br />is pointing up
2569209 2571290 and the little hand<br />is pointing up
2571331 2573700 the kid's door<br />will be in my station.
2573712 2575984 But when the big hand<br />points down
2575995 2578524 the door will be gone.
2578602 2581578 You have until then<br />to put the kid back.
2581624 2584249 Get the picture?
2584326 2586759 ( roaring playfully )
2593943 2594871 Boo!
2594908 2596413 ( giggles )
2596451 2597380 No.
2597416 2598505 Hey, you! Halt!
2598542 2600110 He's the one.
2600215 2601496 The one from<br />the commercial!
2601566 2602622 Affirmative.<br />That's him.
2602659 2603907 Can we get<br />an autograph?
2603914 2605450 Oh, oh, sure.<br />No problem.
2605457 2608594 You can make that out<br />to Bethany, my daughter.
2608674 2609827 Yes. Let's see...
2609832 2611656 ''From your scary friend
2611698 2613299 best wishes...''
2613307 2615259 So I said,<br />''If you talk to me
2615332 2617509 like that again,<br />we're through!''
2617552 2618544 What'd she say?
2618644 2619733 You know my mom.
2619739 2621435 She sent me to my room.
2621540 2623205 See you guys later,<br />take it easy.
2623244 2624332 Bottoms up!
2627457 2628193 ( gasps in horror )
2640677 2641797 No!
2641803 2645324 ( singing )
2645407 2646303 Whoa!

2705359 2706767 ( squeaking and quacking )

2708127 2709727 We have a 2319!
2709797 2710885 Oh, dear.

2720574 2721886 I got us a way out of this mess
2721923 2723043 but we got to hurry.
2723081 2724137 Where is it?
2724239 2726288 ( whimpering )
2726329 2728154 Sull, that's<br />a cube of garbage.
2728227 2729507 ( squeaks )
2729514 2730667 Uh-oh.
2730769 2733553 I-I can still hear<br />her little voice.
2733664 2735104 BOO:<br />Mike Wazowski!

2745404 2746779 Boo, oh,<br />you're all right!
2746851 2748771 I was so worried!
2748780 2753102 Don't you ever run away from me<br />again, young lady!
2753124 2755811 Oh, but I'm so glad<br />you're safe.
2755858 2758930 My, what an affectionate father.
2758944 2760929 Actually, she's<br />my cousin's sister's...
2761035 2761899 Okay, Sulley.
2761999 2762927 That's enough.<br />Let's go.
2762997 2763893 Mike Wazowski!
2763962 2764923 Yeah, yeah.
2764927 2766335 Step aside, kid.<br />We're in a...
2766375 2767240 ( screams in pain )
2767307 2768108 ( screams with laughter )
2768112 2768879 ( electrical buzzing )
2768947 2769907 ( light bulbs shattering )
2769977 2771097 ( gasping )
2771135 2773439 ( baby monsters screaming<br />and crying )
2773483 2775947 Will you stop<br />making Boo laugh?
2776024 2777624 I didn't, so come on!
2777727 2780096 ( screaming and crying<br />continue )
2780269 2781197 I still don't understand.
2781235 2782164 You've got Boo's door?
2782198 2783127 I'II explain later.
2783164 2784092 Run.
2784129 2785474 Okay, let's move,<br />let's move, let's move.
2785512 2786537 Come on.
2786604 2788429 Oh, please be there, please<br />be there, please be there.
2788472 2790008 There it is!
2790111 2790975 Just like Randall said!
2791075 2792035 Randall?<br />What a minute.
2792041 2793001 ( cries out in fear )
2793005 2793966 Oh, hey.
2793971 2794868 One, two, three, four!
2794872 2795832 Get the kid back<br />through the door!
2795837 2796797 Hey, hey.
2796802 2797986 We're going to get<br />our lives back.
2797992 2798952 The nightmare is over.
2798956 2799916 Hey, it's okay, Boo.
2799921 2800754 What's the matter?
2800758 2802006 Come on, it's time to move!
2802044 2803005 Mike, what are you thinking?
2803041 2803969 We can't trust Randall.
2804006 2804934 He's after Boo.
2804971 2805898 Who cares?<br />Let's go.
2805936 2806959 This is a limited time offer.
2807030 2807925 No, no.
2808026 2808890 I don't like this.
2808959 2811327 Look, Sulley, you wanted<br />her door and there it is.
2811339 2812300 Now, let's move.
2812304 2813936 No, Mike.
2813977 2816090 ( sighs ):<br />You want me to prove<br />everything's on the up-and-up?
2816133 2817701 Fine! He wants the door,<br />I get the door...
2817708 2818508 ( whispering ):<br />Mike, wait!
2818544 2820145 He's a paranoid delusional<br />furball.
2822725 2823558 Mike!
2828451 2829890 ( whimpers in fear )
2834242 2835521 ( whining )
2835527 2837160 Shh, shh, shh.
2852290 2853283 ( small cry of surprise )
2870725 2873605 ( lunch bell rings )
2880954 2884251 Hey, Sulley,<br />where you been all day?
2884300 2885772 Sulley? Sulley?
2899646 2900607 Huh?
2900612 2902052 ( whispering ):<br />Mike?
2902091 2903020 Mike?
2903056 2905777 Where are you?
2905791 2907551 You in there?
2907592 2909449 Where are you, buddy?
2909490 2910483 Mike?
2910520 2911865 Hey.
2918016 2919456 ( door thunks )
2921073 2922289 ( excited baby talk )
2922295 2923832 Boo, way to go.
2923871 2924832 ( giggles )
2931560 2932745 It's okay.
2936322 2938659 ( door clunks shut )
2947775 2952320 ( pipes whistling and venting )
2956107 2958699 ( distant voices )
2961544 2963752 RANDALL:<br />Yes! I got the kid!
2963795 2965204 FUNGUS:<br />Oh, huzzah!
2965212 2966172 That's great news.
2966209 2968001 Not that I was concerned,<br />of course.
2968075 2969612 Just get over<br />here and help me!
2969620 2970484 Come on, come<br />on, come on.
2970551 2971512 While we're young<br />here, Fungus!
2973738 2976042 ( both straining )
2976054 2977814 Kid needs to take<br />off a few pounds.
2981716 2982677 ( yelps )
2982681 2983641 Wazowski?!
2983678 2985022 Where is it,<br />you little one-eyed cretin?
2985093 2986245 Okay, first of all,<br />it's cree-tin.
2986251 2987211 If you're going<br />to threaten me
2987250 2988273 do it properly.
2988311 2990359 Second of all, you're nuts<br />if you think kidnapping me
2990402 2992162 is going to help you cheat<br />your way to the top!
2992203 2993548 ( chuckling evilly )
2993618 2997780 You still think this is about<br />that stupid scare record?
2997802 3001066 Well... I did, right up<br />until you chuckled like that
3001083 3004316 and now I'm thinking<br />I should just get out of here.
3004364 3007628 I am about to revolutionize<br />the scaring industry
3007678 3011007 and when I do, even<br />the great James P. Sullivan
3011088 3012560 is going to be<br />working for me.
3012664 3013657 MIKE:<br />Well
3013694 3015935 somebody's certainly<br />been a busy bee.
3015977 3017578 First, I need to know<br />where the kid is
3017619 3018867 and you're going<br />to tell me.
3018938 3020090 Yeah, I don't<br />know anything.
3020096 3021056 Uh-huh, sure.
3021158 3022023 MIKE:<br />I don't.
3022091 3023179 I mean, I don't.
3023216 3024560 Oh-oh.
3024600 3025945 ( mechanical clanging<br />and grinding )
3026016 3026976 What's that?
3027013 3028293 Come on.<br />Wait, wait, wait.
3028364 3029644 Oh-oh. Oh-oh.<br />Oh, come on.
3029650 3030611 No, no, no, no, no.
3030681 3031769 Come on,<br />hey, hey, hey.
3031839 3033503 This thing is moving.
3033576 3035528 I don't like big...
3035570 3037747 moving things that are<br />moving towards me.
3037758 3039198 No! Come on!
3039238 3040646 Hey, Randall!
3040751 3043855 Say hello<br />to the scream extractor.
3043870 3045791 Hello.
3045801 3047049 Come on,<br />where you going?
3047088 3048016 We'II talk.
3048053 3049206 Come on,<br />we'II have a latte!
3049212 3050203 Come on.
3050273 3051937 We can talk<br />about this.
3051946 3054731 ( electrical whirring starts,<br />then grows louder )
3054745 3057465 What's that thing?<br />What is that thing?
3057479 3058664 Wait, wait, wait!
3058701 3059790 Stop, stop!
3059828 3061140 No, no!
3061179 3062139 Come on, hey!
3062176 3063584 ( deep, resonating whirring )
3063657 3065321 Help! Help! Help!
3065393 3066289 Help!
3066358 3068247 ( yelling )
3071087 3072559 ( noise dies away )
3072632 3073623 Oh, for...
3073694 3075006 What did you<br />do wrong this time?
3075044 3076068 I don't know.
3076074 3077259 I calibrated the drive...
3077265 3078705 Go check the machine!
3078712 3080761 There must be something wrong<br />with the scream intake valve.
3080803 3083363 That's the problem<br />with these 3250 units...
3083442 3085362 Huh?
3088171 3090091 Hmm.
3099882 3101130 Psst!
3101167 3102704 Fungus.<br />Fungus.
3102713 3104825 You like cars, huh?
3104867 3106275 'Cause I got a really nice car.
3106412 3108653 If you let me go,<br />I'II give you...
3108696 3109944 a ride in the car.
3109951 3111359 Please, Fungus?
3111399 3113128 I'm sorry, Wazowski,<br />but Randall said
3114810 3117467 I'm not allowed to fraternize<br />with victims of his evil plot.
3117518 3118478 ( gasps )
3118518 3119927 ( clanging )
3119936 3121248 Hmm...
3122224 3123152 ( zapping )
3123191 3125272 ( electrical whirring )
3125286 3128390 ( clanking, rattling, whirring )
3128412 3129372 ( gasps )
3129379 3130339 ( muff<br />ed screams )
3130345 3131082 What happened?
3131120 3132816 Where's Wazowski?
3132860 3134492 ( muff<br />ed screams )
3134504 3136329 ( shuts off machine )
3136405 3137653 Where is he?!
3137695 3139327 ( whimpering )
3139372 3140428 ( growls )
3140499 3141651 ( whimpering )
3141788 3142844 ( squeals )
3142916 3144101 Come on!
3144110 3145646 This is crazy.<br />He's going to kill us!
3145689 3147801 CDA AGENT 1 :<br />Careful.<br />That could be contaminated.
3147815 3149320 We got to get out of here now!
3149362 3151827 We can start a whole new life<br />somewhere far away.
3151877 3153125 Good-bye, Monsters, Inc.!
3153166 3154958 Good-bye, Mr. Waternoose!
3155003 3156379 No, Mike, wait!
3156421 3157765 Hey, what are you doing?
3157808 3159279 Follow me. I have an idea.
3159289 3161946 No! No, no, no, no,<br />no, no, no, no...
3162031 3164079 COMPUTER VOICE ( over PA ):<br />Simulation terminated.
3164124 3165341 WATERNOOSE:<br />No, no, no, no, no.
3165381 3166437 What was that?
3166445 3169198 You're trying to scare the kid,<br />not lull it to sleep.
3169250 3172131 I was going for a<br />snake<br />ninja approach
3172182 3173430 with a little hissing.
3173504 3174400 ( hisses )
3174439 3176839 How many times<br />do I have to tell you?
3176855 3178488 It's all about presence!
3178532 3180485 About how you enter the room!
3180499 3181907 Mr. Waternoose!
3181981 3183837 James! Perfect timing.
3183915 3185355 No, no. Sir, you<br />don't understand.
3185430 3187286 Ah, now, show these monsters<br />how it's done.
3187364 3188260 What? No, no,<br />I can't...
3188330 3189290 Sir...<br />sir, you have
3189298 3190226 to listen to me.
3190232 3191256 Pay attention, everyone.
3191328 3192224 You're about to see
3192295 3193671 the best in<br />the business.
3193713 3194642 Reset the simulator.
3194680 3195609 But-but, sir!
3195647 3196960 MOTHER:<br />Good night, sweetheart.
3197000 3198313 ANIMATRONIC BOY:<br />Night, Mom.
3198354 3199282 Kitty!
3199321 3200378 No, Boo, no, no!
3200386 3202050 Now, give us a big, loud roar.
3202094 3203855 Mr. Waternoose,<br />there's no time for this.
3203897 3205562 Come on. What are you<br />waiting for? Roar!
3205574 3206470 But-but-but, sir!
3206574 3207310 Roar!
3207347 3208627 ( groans )
3208636 3209916 ( roaring ferociously )
3209925 3211430 ( shrieking in terror )
3211473 3212977 ( gasps )
3213084 3214108 ( roaring ferociously )
3214148 3215236 ( squeals )
3215244 3217485 ( Boo crying )
3217564 3218524 ( students applauding )
3218564 3219524 WATERNOOSE:<br />Well done.
3219562 3221259 Well done, James.
3221271 3222711 Boo?
3222721 3225346 --All right, gentlemen,<br />I hope you've learned...<br />--Right this way, everyone.
3225396 3226965 ...a valuable lesson<br />in scaring today.
3227008 3228417 ( fearful whimper )
3228458 3229707 ( whines softly )
3229748 3231092 Boo.
3231166 3232638 ( nervous grunt )
3232714 3234506 ( whining )
3235517 3236734 Boo?
3237709 3239917 ( panicked grunts )
3239965 3241117 ( door slams )
3241157 3243878 Boo, it's me.
3243898 3245018 ( squealing )
3245992 3247497 ( gasps ):<br />The child!
3247507 3248531 Sir, she isn't toxic.
3248571 3250395 I know it sounds<br />crazy, but trust me.
3250473 3251369 Boo?
3251440 3252464 No, no, no, no.
3252535 3253432 It's okay.
3253503 3254527 I was just...
3254598 3255750 ( whimpering in fear )
3255758 3257679 No, no, no, no, no,<br />don't be scared.
3257693 3259421 That wasn't real.
3259433 3260554 It's just a...
3260689 3261714 I was just...
3261755 3262971 ( crying ):<br />No...
3265202 3267218 ( Boo continues crying )
3272229 3273637 ( Boo sobbing )
3273711 3274959 Boo.
3274968 3276473 MIKE:<br />...and he was going<br />to test it out
3276516 3278436 on that sweet,<br />little girl.
3278481 3280209 --Boo.<br />--Now that we have her...
3280255 3281439 ...he is trying<br />to kill us.
3281447 3283239 This whole thing<br />is Randall's fault.
3283252 3284469 Randall?
3284508 3286941 Yes. And we can take you to his<br />secret lab, which is right here
3286959 3287919 in this factory.
3287925 3289173 How could this happen?
3289215 3291103 Oh, how could this happen?
3291149 3293229 Does anyone else<br />know about this?
3293243 3294203 No, sir.
3294210 3295747 Good.
3295790 3298607 This company can't afford<br />any more bad publicity.
3298660 3302756 Now, before we do<br />anything else, let's...
3302784 3304993 take care of the child.
3308393 3311657 Oh, I never thought things<br />would come to this...
3311679 3314592 not in my factory.
3314614 3317814 I'm sorry you boys<br />got mixed up in this.
3317869 3319277 Especially you, James.
3319319 3321015 But now we can set
3321027 3324484 everything straight again<br />for the good of the company.
3324509 3325629 ( whirring )
3325636 3327045 ( thunk )
3327055 3328175 MIKE:<br />Uh...
3328183 3330391 sir, that's not her door.
3330471 3332008 I know, I know.
3334759 3335815 It's yours.
3335822 3336974 ( startled gasps )
3337014 3338103 ( grunts )
3338110 3340254 ( yelling )
3340269 3341070 No!
3342203 3343516 ( gasps )
3343557 3347558 ( voice echoing ):<br />Boo!
3350550 3351575 ( gasps )
3351614 3352575 No! No!
3352582 3354599 No! No! No! No!
3354645 3355636 No!
3355676 3356924 ( desperate grunts )
3356997 3357957 lt's too late!
3357965 3359565 We're banished, genius.
3359576 3361401 We're in the human world!
3361446 3364743 Oh, what a great idea, going<br />to your old pal Waternoose!
3364765 3366909 Too bad he was in<br />on the whole thing!
3366925 3370510 All you had to do was listen<br />to me-- just once!
3370599 3372713 But you didn't, did you?
3372728 3375160 You're still not listening!
3375176 3377928 ( yelling )
3377980 3382045 ( Sulley grunting and groaning )
3382074 3383162 Take that!
3383169 3384834 ( growling )
3384942 3386511 ( gasps in horror )
3389100 3391404 Welcome to the Himalayas!
3391421 3393758 ( wind gusting )
3393838 3395406 ''Abominable''!
3395449 3396378 ( chuckles )
3396416 3397633 Can you believe that?
3397674 3399402 Do I look abominable to you?
3399414 3402294 Why can't they call me<br />the Adorable Snowman or...
3402314 3405035 or the Agreeable Snowman,<br />for crying out loud?
3405119 3406335 I'm a nice guy.
3406377 3407657 Snow cone?
3407698 3408626 Yuck.
3408664 3409592 No, no, no.
3409633 3411168 Don't worry--<br />it's lemon.
3411212 3413324 Uh, how about<br />you, big fella?
3413338 3415451 Snow cone?
3415531 3420043 Did you see the way she...<br />looked at me?
3420138 3421547 ( sighs )
3421557 3423381 Ah, poor guy.
3423426 3424483 I understand.
3424554 3426122 lt ain't easy<br />being banished.
3426198 3427510 Take my buddy, Bigfoot.
3427552 3428705 When he was banished
3428745 3431658 he fashioned an enormous diaper<br />out of poison ivy.
3431743 3433567 Wore it on his head<br />like a tiara.
3433612 3435149 Called himself King Itchy.
3435159 3437879 Ah, it won't be so hard for<br />you guys, though, you know.
3437898 3439371 I mean, how lucky<br />can you get?
3439382 3440886 Banished with your<br />best friend.
3440928 3442336 He is not my friend.
3442378 3444267 Oh. I just assumed you<br />were buddies, you know
3444313 3445817 when I saw you out<br />there in the snow
3445827 3446787 hugging and all that.
3446795 3447884 Look at that big jerk.
3447922 3449330 Ruined my life, and for what?
3449373 3450461 A stupid kid!
3450501 3452389 Because of you,<br />I am now stuck
3452402 3453939 in this frozen<br />wasteland!
3453982 3454942 Wasteland?
3454980 3457317 I think you mean wonderland!
3457398 3459767 I mean, how about<br />all this fabulous snow, huh?
3459816 3462312 Oh, and wait till you see<br />the local village.
3462330 3463899 Cutest thing in the world.
3463941 3466151 I haven't even mentioned<br />all the free yak's milk.
3466229 3467766 What... what did you say?
3467808 3468737 Yak's milk.
3468776 3470473 Milking a yak<br />ain't exactly a picnic.
3470517 3472214 You know, once you pick<br />the hairs out
3472258 3473218 it's very nutritious.
3473321 3474633 No, no. Something<br />about a village.
3474739 3475924 Where?<br />Are there kids in it?
3475932 3477052 Kids? Sure.
3477093 3479173 Tough kids, sissy kids,<br />kids who climb on rocks...
3479219 3480147 Where is it?!
3480186 3481563 It's at the bottom<br />of the mountain.
3481604 3482725 Around a three-day hike.
3482733 3484045 Oh, three days?!
3484054 3485430 We need to get there now!
3485471 3486431 ( thump )
3489340 3490300 ( ding )
3496011 3497869 You want to go to the village?
3497914 3500218 Okay, rule number one<br />out here.
3500233 3501322 Always...
3501363 3502419 No.
3502490 3504667 Never go out in a blizzard.
3504713 3506314 We need to get to Boo.
3506390 3507734 ( grunts, then gasps )
3507777 3509570 Boo?!
3509581 3510956 What about us?
3511032 3511928 ( grunts )
3511999 3513600 Ever since that kid<br />came in
3513643 3515051 you've ignored<br />everything I've said
3515061 3516213 and now look where we are!
3517252 3519781 Oh, we were about<br />to break the record, Sulley.
3519799 3521239 We would have had it made!
3521249 3522498 None of that matters now.
3522506 3525002 None of it matter...
3525053 3526237 Wa-wait a second.
3526278 3528421 None of it matters?
3528470 3529974 ( sighs )
3530113 3531458 MIKE:<br />Okay.
3531467 3533450 That's.... no. Good. Great.
3533465 3536090 So, now the truth comes out,<br />doesn't it?
3536108 3539277 Oh, would you<br />look at that?
3539299 3541091 We're out of<br />snow cones, uh...
3541168 3542768 Let me... just go outside
3542779 3544060 and make some more.
3544069 3548326 Sulley, what about everything<br />we ever worked for?
3548388 3551557 Does that matter?<br />Huh?
3551611 3553499 And what about Celia?
3553545 3557257 I am never... never<br />going to see her again.
3557283 3558788 Doesn't that matter?
3562054 3563014 ( sighs )
3564214 3565591 What about me?
3565665 3567201 I'm your pal.
3567244 3569261 I'm... I'm your best friend.
3569339 3571355 Don't I matter?
3573174 3574646 ( sighs )
3574656 3575777 I'm sorry, Mike.
3575817 3578665 I'm sorry we're stuck out here.
3578686 3580799 I didn't mean<br />for this to happen.
3580844 3582477 But Boo's in trouble.
3582553 3584345 I think there might<br />be a way to save her
3584391 3585927 if we can just<br />get down to that...
3585970 3586898 ''We''?
3586936 3588697 Whoa, whoa, whoa. ''We''?
3588805 3590022 No.
3590062 3592079 There's no ''we'' this time, pal.
3592126 3594303 I-if-if you want<br />to go out there
3594318 3595630 and freeze to death
3595672 3598009 you be my guest...
3598024 3600873 because you're on your own.
3615880 3618569 * *
3623294 3626719 ( wind whistles )
3636542 3639039 Hey, I got more snow cones!
3644212 3645141 Ohh!
3649885 3650813 Ahh!
3657652 3658100 Ahh!
3658103 3659063 ( yells )
3659071 3662112 ( grunting and groaning )
3665581 3668494 ( wind howling )
3670867 3674132 ( distant child screaming )
3678185 3681097 ( children screaming )
3684437 3685878 Oh, come on, now, George.
3685888 3687423 I know you can do this.
3687467 3690635 I picked out an easy door<br />for you-- in Nepal.
3690657 3692674 Nice, quiet Nepal.
3692753 3694385 You know, you're right.
3694429 3695581 Here, take this.
3695621 3697254 Go get 'em, Georgie!
3697266 3698994 Gangway! Look out!<br />Coming through!
3699038 3700286 Sorry, George.

3708159 3709407 ( whistling )
3709480 3710632 Out of the way!
3710673 3711601 --Hey!<br />--Whoa!
3711641 3713113 Don't!
3713123 3714724 ( gasps )
3714735 3715887 ( whimpers )
3715895 3717111 Finally!
3717184 3719264 I never should have<br />trusted you with this.
3719343 3721744 Because of you, I had<br />to banish my top scarer!
3721761 3724065 With this machine,<br />we won't need scarers.
3724113 3726290 Besides, Sullivan got<br />what he deserved.
3726338 3729282 Sullivan was twice the scarer<br />you will ever be!
3729303 3730263 ( low growl )
3730335 3731455 ( panting )
3731463 3732423 ( clanging )

3745064 3746697 ( yelling )
3746740 3748021 ( shrieking )
3748062 3749149 ( roaring )
3750931 3751762 Kitty!
3751800 3752472 Sullivan?
3752510 3753725 ( grunting )
3756538 3758458 Wh-whoa!
3758472 3759721 Kitty!
3759730 3760818 Sorry, Boo.
3760825 3762233 Stop him!
3762276 3763395 ( growls )
3763437 3765837 Let's get you home.
3765886 3766461 ( panting )
3766499 3767426 ( blow lands )
3767465 3768425 Ooh!
3768465 3769777 WATERNOOSE:<br />Finish him off!

3774008 3774968 ( thunk )
3776490 3777995 You don't know how long
3778038 3780854 I've wanted to do<br />that, Sullivan.
3780906 3781834 ( grunts )
3781873 3782833 ( chuckles )
3783839 3785472 ( punches landing )
3785515 3786443 Hah!
3786482 3787346 Ooh!
3787417 3788665 ( shrieks )
3790060 3791435 ( panting )
3791444 3792405 Ooh!
3792413 3793566 Mike?!
3793573 3795364 Look, it's not that I<br />don't care about the kid.
3795410 3796626 Mike, you don't<br />understand.
3796699 3798396 Yes, I do. I was<br />just mad, that's all.
3798408 3799783 I needed some time to think.
3799857 3801778 But you shouldn't<br />have left me out there.
3801824 3802785 ( thump )
3802791 3804166 I'm being attacked!
3804209 3805488 No, I'm not attacking you.
3805562 3806682 I'm trying to be honest.
3806691 3807651 Just hear me out.
3807657 3808842 You and I are a team.
3808883 3811507 Nothing is more important<br />than our friendship.
3811526 3812486 I-I-I know, kid.
3812492 3813580 He's too sensitive.
3813652 3815252 ( gagging )
3815263 3816032 ( whining cry )
3816070 3817350 Come on, pal.
3817392 3818992 If you start crying,<br />I'm going to cry
3819035 3820476 and I'II never get through this.
3820518 3823015 I'm sorry<br />I wasn't there for you
3823033 3823993 but I am now.
3823999 3824799 Ow!
3824805 3826213 Sulley, I am baring<br />my soul here.
3826288 3828273 The least you could do<br />is pay attention!
3829318 3830886 ( yells in pain )
3830961 3832882 ( sighs in relief )
3832895 3835071 Hey, look at that--<br />it's Randall! It's...
3835086 3836046 Oh.

3837376 3838592 WATERNOOSE:<br />Get up!
3838632 3840489 There can't be<br />any witnesses.
3840534 3841751 There won't be.
3842145 3843234 I'm glad you came back, Mike.
3843274 3845738 Somebody's got take care<br />of you, you big hairball.
3845819 3846780 ( Celia screaming )
3846787 3848387 ( screaming )
3848495 3849359 Ow!
3849429 3851349 Schmoopsie-poo,<br />I really can't talk.
3851363 3852388 Come on!

3857294 3858382 Here's the truth.
3858455 3860151 You know the kid that they're<br />looking for-- Sulley let her in.
3860196 3861156 We tried to<br />send her back
3861195 3862507 but Waternoose<br />had this secret plot
3862516 3864853 and now Randall's right behind<br />us and he's trying to kill us!
3864901 3868071 You expect me to believe that<br />pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?!
3868093 3869468 Mike Wazowski!

3916954 3920059 We have to get Boo's door<br />and find a station.
3920113 3923730 MIKE:<br />What a plan--<br />simple, yet insane!

4107901 4109596 Sulley, what are you doing?
4109642 4110986 Sulley!
4110997 4111957 ( Sulley grunts )
4111964 4112924 ( Mike grunts )
4112931 4113892 ( yells )
4113900 4116620 Looks like we caught<br />the express, pal.
4116705 4117730 Do you see them?
4117801 4119274 Straight ahead!
4121220 4122436 No...
4122479 4124399 ( stifled cry )
4130702 4132719 ( grunting nervously )
4142410 4143210 Kitty!
4143248 4144272 Boo!
4144796 4145789 ( yelling )
4145828 4148869 ( whimpering )
4148989 4153534 RANDALL:<br />Look at everybody's<br />favorite scarer now!
4153601 4156002 You stupid, pathetic waste!
4156020 4156980 ( thump )
4159116 4161997 You've been number one<br />for too long, Sullivan.
4162019 4164099 Now your time is up!
4164114 4165971 And don't worry.
4166018 4169058 I'II take good care of the kid.
4169114 4170010 No!
4170017 4171649 ( yelling )
4171662 4174670 ( Boo grunting<br />and Randall gagging )
4174726 4176422 ( Randall groaning )
4186916 4188901 ( gagging )
4188981 4190709 ( roaring angrily )
4190755 4192867 She's not scared<br />of you anymore.
4192948 4194420 ( roars angrily )
4194495 4196576 Looks like you're out of a job.
4196656 4197808 ( gulps )
4197850 4198906 All right, come on,<br />over the plate.
4198978 4200035 Let's see<br />the ol' stuff here, pal.
4200140 4201709 Come on, now, chuck him,<br />chuck him, baby. Hum, baby.
4201752 4202777 Hum, baby,<br />here's the pitch.
4202817 4204097 Wait, please, don't,<br />don't, don't!
4204107 4204907 No!
4205042 4205874 And he is...<br />out of here!
4205977 4207194 ( crickets chirping )
4207203 4209699 BOY:<br />Mama, another gator<br />got in the house.
4209751 4210679 Another gator?!
4210718 4212575 Give me that shovel!<br />Come here!
4212620 4214029 ( clanging, yelling )
4214072 4215928 Get him, mama!<br />Get that gator!
4216943 4218351 Care to do the honors,<br />Mikey?
4218425 4221114 With pleasure.
4225683 4227443 ( thud )
4227489 4228833 ( baby talk )
4228876 4230157 That's right, Boo.
4230198 4231287 You did it.
4231327 4232447 You beat him.
4232456 4233416 ( raspberry )
4233423 4234831 Come on.
4236971 4239051 Okay, Boo,<br />it's time to go home.
4239067 4241275 Take care of yourself,<br />and be a good girl, okay?
4241325 4242413 ( gasps )
4242454 4243575 Oh, no!
4243583 4244510 The power's out!
4244517 4245926 Make her laugh again.
4245969 4247249 All right, I got a move here.
4247291 4248571 It'II bring down the house.
4248614 4249670 Up...
4249743 4250799 ( metallic clang )
4250904 4251960 ( groans softly )
4252000 4254209 Oh, sorry, she didn't see that.
4254289 4255826 What?! What'd you do,<br />forget to check
4255870 4257119 if her stupid hood was up
4257226 4258313 ya big dope?!
4258353 4260530 ( singsong ):<br />Uncle Mike, try not to yell<br />in front of her.
4260547 4262083 You know we still need her<br />to laugh.
4262127 4263055 Right.
4263094 4264023 ( laughs )
4264061 4265694 Hey, Boo, just kidding. Look!
4265707 4266667 ( gibberish )
4266674 4268211 Funny, right? Huh?<br />See what the...
4268223 4269279 These are the jokes, kid.
4269384 4270440 Whoa!
4270480 4272273 What's happening?
4272287 4274335 SULLIVAN:<br />Hold on!
4274512 4277553 When the door lands<br />in this station, cut the power.
4277576 4280520 You'II have the child<br />and the criminals responsible
4280575 4282912 for this whole mess.
4282930 4284819 Great.<br />A welcoming committee!
4284930 4286625 What are we going to do?!
4286703 4290223 ( electrical humming )
4292573 4294013 ( clang )
4297894 4298982 This is the CDA.
4299023 4300111 Come out slowly
4300152 4301720 with the child<br />in plain sight.
4301764 4303972 Okay, okay.
4304023 4304983 You got us.
4304990 4306078 Here we are.
4306086 4307046 Here's the kid.
4307118 4308558 I'm cooperating.
4308601 4310458 But before you take us away,<br />I have one thing to say:
4310504 4311433 ( gags )
4311471 4312816 Catch!
4312859 4314779 ( all shouting ):<br />2319!
4314827 4316427 We have a toxic<br />projectile!
4316503 4318039 Halt! After the suspect!
4318051 4319459 Cover the area!<br />Bring in reinforcements!
4319503 4321007 WATERNOOSE:<br />Stop him!
4321018 4323546 ( Boo squeaks )
4323566 4324750 Come on.
4324823 4326968 Don't let them get away.
4327017 4327946 What...?!
4327984 4329105 No, wait, wait!
4329114 4330714 Come back!<br />He has the child!
4330823 4332007 ( frustrated growl )
4334080 4335809 ( Boo squeaks )
4335918 4338287 Sullivan? Sullivan!
4338306 4339906 Give me the child!
4339918 4341070 Me not go!
4341143 4342008 Give her to me!
4343176 4345352 ( panting )
4345434 4346809 ( grunts )
4348626 4350386 ( metallic creaking )
4350496 4354785 WATERNOOSE:<br />Open this door!<br />Open this door!
4354818 4356482 ( growling and pounding )
4356559 4358320 Hey!
4358366 4359838 Sullivan!
4359849 4360713 ( yells )
4360784 4362449 WATERNOOSE:<br />Don't do it.
4362526 4363230 ( beep )
4363332 4364036 Come on.
4364106 4367018 Don't go in that room!
4367074 4368610 ( yelling )
4368686 4370927 I think we stopped him, Boo.
4370976 4372063 You're safe now.
4372105 4375273 You be a good girl, okay?
4375363 4377795 This has gone<br />far enough, James.
4377813 4379157 She's home now!<br />Just leave her alone!
4379200 4380320 I can't do that!
4380328 4381417 She's seen too much.
4381458 4383058 You both have.
4383102 4384446 It doesn't have to be this way.
4384457 4386058 I have no choice!
4386102 4387126 Times have changed.
4387134 4388766 Scaring isn't enough anymore.
4388812 4390188 But kidnapping children?!
4390230 4391766 I'II kidnap<br />a thousand children
4391810 4393250 before I let<br />this company die
4393295 4395023 and I'II silence anyone
4395068 4396860 who gets in my way!
4396906 4398186 No!
4398196 4400501 ( child@s voice ):<br />Good night, Mom.
4400518 4402214 ( woman@s voice ):<br />Good night, sweetheart.
4402227 4403124 Good night, Mom.
4403228 4405404 What, wh-what is this?!<br />What? Who? Huh?
4405453 4407694 COMPUTER:<br />Simulation terminated.<br />Simulation terminated.
4407711 4409694 Well, I don't know<br />about the rest of you guys
4409709 4411630 but I spotted<br />several big mistakes.
4411645 4413086 But-but-but how-how did...?<br />How did...?
4413097 4414249 MIKE:<br />You know what?
4414258 4417011 Let's watch my favorite part<br />again... shall we?
4417032 4420072 ( repeating ):<br />I'II kidnap a thousand children<br />before I let this company die.
4420159 4421952 What...? Wha...?
4421997 4423918 I'II kidnap<br />a thousand children before...
4423997 4425341 ( baby talk )
4425416 4426793 Shh, shh, shh, shh!
4426835 4428339 Shh!
4428350 4429311 I'II get him.
4429319 4430439 All right,<br />come with us, sir.
4430447 4431503 Wh-what are<br />you doing?
4431608 4432568 Take your<br />hands off me!
4432576 4433632 You can't<br />arrest me!
4433705 4434889 I hope you're happy, Sullivan!
4434964 4437076 You've destroyed this company.<br />Monsters, Incorporated is dead!
4437124 4439652 Where will everyone<br />get their scream now?!
4439736 4441945 The energy crisis<br />will only get worse
4442026 4443530 because of you!
4443574 4444854 ( loud clang )
4446574 4448750 Stay where you are.
4448766 4449726 Huh?
4449798 4451110 Number One<br />wants to talk to you.
4451153 4453201 Attention!
4459022 4461007 Hello, boys.
4461022 4462014 BOTH:<br />Roz?!
4462054 4465863 Two and a half years<br />of undercover work
4465924 4467812 were almost wasted
4467827 4471316 when you intercepted<br />that child, Mr. Sullivan.
4471343 4474800 Of course, without your help,<br />I never would have known
4474858 4477642 that this went all the way up<br />to Waternoose.
4477696 4479425 ( baby talk )
4479470 4481006 ( gasps )
4481051 4482234 ROZ:<br />Now...
4482340 4483877 about the girl...
4483889 4486993 I just want to<br />send her home.
4487050 4488202 Very good.
4488210 4489330 ( chiming tones )
4489339 4491068 Bring me a door shredder.
4491081 4494185 What, you mean... you mean,<br />I can't see her again?
4494209 4497474 That's the way it has to be.
4497531 4500507 I'II give you<br />five minutes.
4505400 4506712 ( whirring hum )
4510787 4512323 Well, so long, kid.
4512399 4514319 Mike Wazowski!
4514334 4515774 Yeah.
4515785 4520842 Ah, Boo,<br />it's been fun.
4520880 4522225 Go ahead.
4522268 4524636 Go grow up.
4530459 4532412 ( door creaking )
4534975 4537247 ( squealing in delight )
4537265 4538417 ( laughing )
4542747 4543676 Uh-uh, B-Boo...?
4543714 4544643 ( speaking baby talk )
4544683 4545770 Um... Boo?
4545811 4547219 ( speaking baby talk )
4547295 4548383 Oh, look at that.
4548391 4550599 Yeah, you know...
4550649 4552345 Oh, that's cute, yeah.
4552358 4553414 ( baby talk )
4553422 4554575 Uh, Boo, um...
4554616 4555544 ( squeaking toy )
4555583 4557023 Well, that's very nice.
4557067 4558796 ( giggling )
4558809 4560185 Come here, you!
4560228 4561412 ( squeals )
4561517 4563470 ( both laughing )
4568000 4570754 * Oh, he's a happy bear... *
4570838 4572375 ( giggling )
4572451 4574435 ( baby talk )
4576225 4578049 Nothing's coming<br />out of your closet
4578063 4579567 to scare you<br />anymore, right?
4579611 4580667 Mm...
4580739 4583076 Yeah.
4583158 4585463 Good-bye, Boo.
4585546 4588138 Kitty.
4588158 4590207 Kitty has to go.
4606637 4608782 * *
4629182 4631326 Boo!
4631374 4633551 ( gasps )
4633568 4636576 Kitty?
4636631 4638872 ( motor buzzing loudly )
4642404 4643589 ( clicks off )
4643630 4644974 None of this
4644984 4647864 ever happened, gentlemen.
4647886 4652399 And I don't want to see<br />any paperwork on this.
4654724 4656836 ( door closes )
4673269 4675510 Take him away.
4675559 4677447 ( all murmuring )
4677494 4679414 I bet we get<br />the rest of the day off.
4679429 4680581 You idiot!
4680590 4682639 They're going to shut down<br />the factory!
4682654 4684383 ( all gasp )
4684396 4686412 I'm telling you, pal,<br />when that wall went up
4686460 4688861 you should have seen the look<br />on Waternoose's face.
4688912 4691024 Whoo-hoo! I hope we get<br />a copy of that tape.
4691071 4692256 Hey, you all right?
4692265 4694346 Come on, pal,<br />cheer up, we did it!
4694362 4695418 We got Boo home.
4695491 4697668 Ah, sure, we put the factory<br />in the toilet, and...
4697748 4700085 gee, hundreds of people<br />will be out of work now.
4700199 4702408 Not to mention the angry mob<br />that'II come after us
4702489 4704249 when there's no more power,<br />but, hey...
4704328 4707208 at least we had<br />some laughs, right?
4709326 4712079 Laughs...
4712132 4713380 ( crickets chirping )
4713455 4715151 ( wind blowing softly )
4715228 4717885 ( door quietly creaks open )
4727097 4728281 ( boy gasps )
4730709 4732246 Hey, is this thing on?<br />Hello?
4732257 4733857 Hello?<br />Testing, testing.
4733934 4735278 Hey, good evening.<br />How are you?
4735288 4736633 How are you?<br />Nice to see you.
4736707 4738660 I tell you, it's good<br />to be here in... your room.
4738707 4739827 Where you from?
4739868 4741084 Never mind.
4741127 4743047 You're in<br />kindergarten, right?
4743126 4744182 Oh, I love kindergarten.
4744222 4745918 Best three years of my life.
4746932 4748276 Of my life.
4748318 4749246 But I love sports.
4749286 4750535 Dodgeball<br />was the best.
4750576 4751504 Oh, yeah.
4751544 4752920 I was the fastest one out there.
4752962 4754626 Course I was the ball.
4754672 4756368 But I...
4756413 4757919 was the ball, see?
4757994 4759531 All right.
4763574 4765142 ( rumbling )
4765186 4766722 ( rumbling gets louder )
4766734 4767886 ( gurgling )
4767895 4769816 Ah...
4769830 4771078 ( huge burp )
4771088 4772208 Ah?
4772216 4773785 ( laughing )
4773862 4774918 Hey, thanks a lot.
4775023 4776111 I'II be here all week.
4776119 4777816 Remember to tip your waitresses.
4777829 4779589 ( guffawing )
4779634 4780915 ( rippling gurgle )
4780957 4782270 ( bell dings )
4782280 4783432 Great job, Mikey.
4783504 4785585 You filled your quota on<br />the first kid of the day.
4785665 4786753 Not bad, huh?
4786795 4788938 You know, only somebody<br />with perfect comedic timing
4788988 4790780 could produce this much energy<br />in one shot.
4790827 4792266 Uh-huh, and the fact<br />that laughter is
4792342 4793750 ten times more<br />powerful than scream
4793792 4794850 had nothing to do with it.
4794922 4796042 ( clears throat )
4796050 4797298 CELIA:<br />Oh, Googley Bear.
4797308 4799581 Come here, you.
4799630 4800558 Schmoopsie-poo!
4800599 4801559 Googley.
4801597 4802686 Whoa!
4802727 4803815 ( snakes chittering )
4803888 4804912 ( Mike giggling )
4804985 4805976 Girls!<br />Girls, put...
4806049 4808193 Stop, stop, stop!
4808306 4810515 Michael,<br />you're such a charmer.
4810563 4811876 Hey, did you bring<br />the magazine?
4811886 4813198 They just delivered<br />a whole box.
4813208 4814168 Let me see it!
4814176 4815232 ( laughing )
4815336 4816777 Sulley and I<br />made the cover, right?
4816853 4820053 ( whispering ):<br />I don't believe it.
4820174 4821711 ( sympathetically ):<br />Googley Bear...
4821754 4824924 I'm on the cover<br />of a magazine!

4883968 4885216 Sorry it took
4885258 4886347 so long, pal.
4886420 4888788 It was a lot of wood<br />to go through.
4888838 4890375 You know,<br />it only works
4890418 4892339 if you have<br />every piece.

4906550 4910390 * With a million or two *
4910390 4913207 Mike:<br />* I'd live in<br />a penthouse *
4913303 4917688 * In a room<br />with a view *
4917720 4919513 * And if I were handsome *
4919513 4920473 No way.
4920473 4921625 It could happen.
4921721 4925754 * Those dreams<br />do come true *
4925818 4929626 * I wouldn't have nothing<br />if I didn't have you *
4929690 4933404 * Wouldn't have nothing if I<br />didn't have *
4933467 4936988 * Wouldn't have nothing<br />if I didn't have *

4939261 4940829 Can I tell<br />you something?
4940861 4943037 * For years<br />I have envied *
4943102 4944126 You were green with it.
4944158 4947870 * Your grace<br />and your charm *
4947934 4952575 * Everyone loves<br />you, you know *
4952575 4955745 * Yes, I know,<br />I know, I know *
4955776 4958977 * But I must admit it *
4959041 4963266 * Big guy, you<br />always come through *
4963298 4968323 * I wouldn't have nothing<br />if I didn't have you *
4970531 4974084 BOTH:<br />* You and me together *
4974116 4977797 * That's how it<br />always should be *
4977797 4983654 * One without the other<br />don't mean nothing to me *
4983654 4988167 * Nothing to me *
4988167 4989767 * Yeah, I wouldn't<br />be nothing *
4989831 4991368 * No *
4991368 4994824 * If I didn't<br />have you to serve *
4994857 4998633 * I'm just a punky<br />little eyeball *
4998698 5002250 * And a funky<br />optic nerve *
5002250 5005963 * Hey, I never<br />told you this *
5006059 5008556 * Sometimes I get<br />a little blue *
5008556 5010124 Looks good on you.
5010124 5012332 * But I wouldn't<br />have nothing *
5012397 5015309 * If I didn't<br />have you... *
5015309 5018670 Let's dance.
5018702 5020814 Look, Ma,<br />I'm dancing!
5023151 5025135 Would you let me lead?
5025167 5026735 Look at that.<br />It's true.
5026800 5028880 Big guys are light<br />on their feet.
5028944 5030032 Don't you dare dip me.
5030064 5032337 Don't you dare dip me,<br />don't you dare dip me.
5032337 5034290 Ow. I should<br />have stretched.
5034321 5037618 * Yes, I wouldn't<br />be nothing *
5037681 5040051 * If I didn't have you *
5040051 5041426 I know what you<br />mean, Sulley.
5041491 5042387 * Because... *
5042451 5043859 * I wouldn't know<br />where to go *
5043859 5045140 * Me, too,<br />because I... *
5045140 5047252 * Wouldn't know<br />what to do *
5047252 5048916 Why do you keep<br />singing my part?
5048916 5051669 BOTH:<br />* I don't have to say it *
5051701 5052821 Ah, say it anyway.
5052821 5053781 * 'Cause we... *
5053781 5056406 * Both know it's true *
5056406 5060919 * I wouldn't have nothing<br />if I didn't have *
5061047 5064567 * I wouldn't have nothing if I<br />didn't have *
5064567 5068793 * I wouldn't have nothing<br />if I didn't have you *

5083675 5085692 * 'Cause we both<br />know it's true *
5085756 5087612 Let's take it<br />home, big guy.
