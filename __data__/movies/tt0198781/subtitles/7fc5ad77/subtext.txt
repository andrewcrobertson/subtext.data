195529 197573 Simulation terminated.
197865 202536 -All right. Mr. Bile, is it?<br />-My friends call me Phlegm.
203537 206164 Mr. Bile, can you tell me<br />what you did wrong?
206206 209543 -I fell down?<br />-No, no, before that.
210002 213046 Can anyone tell me<br />Mr. Bile's big mistake?
214047 215215 Anyone?
217009 219887 Let's take a look at the tape.<br />Here we go.
220345 222848 Right there.
222890 225434 See? The door.<br />You left it wide open.
226602 229479 And leaving the door open<br />is the worst mistake
229563 232733 any employee can make because...
233567 237738 -It could let in a draft?<br />-It could let in a child.
238488 240240 Mr. Waternoose.
240407 245162 There's nothing more toxic or deadly<br />than a human child.
245412 247623 A single touch could kill you.
248415 252419 Leave a door open and a child<br />could walk right into this factory,
252586 254171 right into the monster world.
254254 256757 I won't go in a kid's room.<br />You can't make me.
256798 259968 You're going in there<br />because we need this.
266558 270687 Our city is counting on you<br />to collect those children's screams.
270771 273565 Without scream we have no power.
274024 275776 Yes, it's dangerous work.
275817 278737 And that's why I need you<br />to be at your best.
278779 282574 I need scarers who are<br />confident, tenacious, tough.
282950 284409 Intimidating.
284743 290123 I need scarers like...<br />Like James P. Sullivan.
293710 297256 Hey, good morning, Monstropolis.<br />It's five after 6:00 a.m.
297297 299091 in the big Monster City.
299132 302845 The temperature's a balmy 65 degrees<br />which is good for you reptiles.
302928 306974 And it looks like it's gonna be<br />a perfect day to lie in bed, sleep in,
307182 311645 or simply work off that flab<br />that's hanging over the bed!
311687 313272 Get up, Sulley!
315440 317901 I don't believe I ordered<br />a wake-up call, Mikey.
317985 320571 Less talk, more pain,<br />marshmallow boy!
321154 323949 Feel the burn.<br />You call yourself a monster?
324283 326618 Scary feet, scary feet.<br />The kid's awake!
326660 329371 Scary feet, scary feet, scary feet.<br />Kid's asleep!
330873 332749 Twins! In a bunk bed!
334501 336170 I thought I had you there.
336211 339840 OK, Sulley, here we go.<br />You ready? Follow it. It's over here.
339923 343468 Over there. Don't let the kid touch you.<br />Don't let him touch you!
343594 346972 I don't know but it's been said<br />I love scarin' kids in bed
347055 350475 Fight that plaque.<br />Scary monsters don't have plaque.
350517 352853 One-eighteen. Do you have 119?
352936 354563 Do I see 120?
354730 357357 -I don't believe it.<br />-I'm not breaking a sweat.
357399 359776 Not you. Look!<br />The new commercial's on.
360694 363864 The future is bright<br />at Monsters, Incorporated.
363947 366158 -I'm in this one.<br />-We're part of your life.
366200 369036 We power your car.<br />We warm your home.
369077 370787 We light your city.
370871 373373 -I'm Monsters, Incorporated.<br />-Hey, look! Betty!
373832 377336 Carefully matching every child<br />to their ideal monster,
377377 379463 to produce superior scream.
379546 382382 Refined into clean,<br />dependable energy.
382591 387179 Every time you turn something on,<br />Monsters, Incorporated is there.
387221 390724 -I'm Monsters, Incorporated.<br />-We know the challenge.
390766 392768 The window of innocence is shrinking.
392851 395395 Human kids are harder to scare.
395437 398023 Of course,<br />MI is prepared for the future.
398065 400025 With the top scarers,
400067 401735 the best refineries,
401818 404530 and research into<br />new energy techniques.
405447 407074 OK, here I come.
407157 409660 We're working for a better tomorrow,
409743 413330 -today.<br />-We're Monsters, Incorporated.
413580 416375 We're MI, Monsters, Incorporated.
416416 418752 We scare because we care.
420921 423048 -I can't believe it.<br />-Mike.
423090 425384 I was on TV!
425759 427719 Did you see me? I'm a natural.
428387 431056 Hello?<br />I know! Wasn't I great?
431306 433725 Did the whole family see it?<br />It's your mom.
433767 435602 What can I say?<br />The camera loves me.
447948 451368 I'm telling you, you're gonna<br />be seeing this face on TV more often.
451451 454079 Yeah? On  Monstropolis' Most Wanted?
455289 458166 You've been jealous of my good looks<br />since the fourth grade.
458250 460460 -Have a good day, sweetie.<br />-You too, hon.
462337 464590 -OK, Sulley, hop on in.<br />-Nope.
464631 467843 -Hey, where you going?<br />-Mikey, there's a scream shortage.
467926 469636 -We're walking.<br />-Walking?
469720 471597 -No, no.<br />-Come on.
471638 473140 My baby needs to be driven.
473223 475392 My baby. I'll call you.
477644 480147 -You know why I bought the car?<br />-Not really.
480230 483442 To drive it. You know,<br />on the street with the honk, honk,
484318 487362 -no walking involved.<br />-Give it a rest, will ya, butterball?
487779 490824 -You could use the exercise.<br />-I could use the exercise? Look at you.
490908 492659 You have your own climate.
492701 495204 -How many tentacles jump the rope?<br />-How many tentacles jump the rope?
495287 497080 Morning, Mike. Morning, Sulley.
497164 499041 Morning, kids. How you doing?
499124 503045 -Hi, Mike. Bye, Sulley.<br />-Hey!

514972 516350 -Fellas.<br />-Hey, Tony.
516390 519102 Tony, Tony.
519727 523023 I hear somebody's close to breaking<br />the all-time scare record.
523524 527194 Just trying to make sure<br />there's enough scream to go around.
527277 529988 -Hey, on the house.<br />-Hey, thanks.
530072 531406 Bada-bing.
534201 535577 Oh, great.

574241 577744 -Hey, Mr. Sullivan.<br />-Guys, I told you, call me Sulley.
578829 582124 -I don't think so.<br />-We want to wish you good luck today.
582207 586044 Hey, hey, get lost, you two.<br />You're making him lose his focus.
586170 587963 -Sorry.<br />-See you later, fellas.

598974 602102 Miss Fearmonger is on vacation.<br />Would you like her voicemail?
602144 605689 -Schmoopsie-pooh.<br />-Googly bear.
606023 610277 -Happy birthday.<br />-Googly-woogly, you remembered.
610611 614281 -Hey, Sulley-wulley.<br />-Hey, Celia-wheelia.
614948 616950 -Happy birthday.<br />-Thanks.
617284 620287 So are we going<br />anywhere special tonight?
620495 624833 I just got us into a little place<br />called Harryhausen's.
625459 629171 Harryhausen's? But it's impossible<br />to get a reservation there.
629254 632758 Not for googly bear.<br />I will see you at quittin' time.
632799 634927 -Not a minute later.<br />-OK, sweetheart.
634968 636803 Think romantical thoughts.
636887 640265 You and me<br />Me and you
640307 642142 Both of us together
643435 644770 You know, pal, she's the one.
644811 647648 -That's it. She is the one.<br />-I'm happy for you.
647689 650150 Thanks for hooking me up<br />with those reservations.
650234 653320 They're under the name "googly bear."
653403 656406 Good...<br />You know, that wasn't very funny.
659826 662162 -What the...<br />-Wazowski.
664206 665207 What do you know?
665290 668168 It scares little kids<br />and little monsters.
668502 671755 I wasn't scared.<br />I have allergies.
673257 676176 -Sure.<br />-Randall, save it for the scare floor.
676218 680138 I'm in the zone today, Sullivan.<br />Gonna do serious scaring.
680180 683350 -Putting up some big numbers.<br />-Randall, that's great.
683433 687604 That should make it more humiliating<br />when we break the record first.
689022 692776 Do you hear that?<br />It's the winds of change.
695571 697531 "You hear that? It's the winds of..."
697614 700617 What a creep.<br />One of these days I am really
701118 703537 gonna let you<br />teach that guy a lesson.
710544 712546 Chalooby. Baby.
714381 717718 Good morning, Roz,<br />my succulent garden snail.
717801 721054 -Who would we be scaring today?<br />-Wazowski.
721096 723599 You didn't file your paperwork<br />last night.
723682 725559 Oh, that darn paperwork.
725601 728937 Wouldn't it be easier<br />if it all just blew away?
729980 732816 Don't let it happen again.
732941 735986 Yes. Well, I'll try to be less careless.
736069 738906 I'm watching you, Wazowski.
739031 741074 Always watching.
741200 743243 -She's nuts.<br />-Always.
744244 746538 All scare floors are now active.
746955 749833 Assistants, please report<br />to your stations.
796588 799675 OK, people,<br />Eastern Seaboard coming online.
799758 801802 We got scarers coming out.
816650 818902 They are so awesome.
865616 868035 Hey, may the best monster win.
868493 869953 I plan to.
870871 874541 We are on in seven, six, five,
874875 878045 four, three, two...
883842 886720 You're the boss.<br />You're the big hairy boss.
896355 898440 I'm feeling good today, Mikey.
900234 902903 Attaboy. Another door coming right up.
910536 912079 You're still behind, Randall.
912162 915290 -Maybe I should realign the scream...<br />-Get me a door.
915374 916667 Door, yes, door.
942359 944653 Well, Jerry, what's the damage so far?
944736 947865 We may actually<br />make our quota today, sir.
948156 950075 First time in a month.
957374 959501 -What happened?<br />-The kid almost touched me.
959585 962671 -She got this close to me.<br />-She wasn't scared of you?
962796 965257 -She was only six.<br />-I could have been dead.
965299 969011 -I could have died.<br />-Keep it together, man.
969970 972347 Hey, we got a dead door over here.
972639 974725 -I'm coming.<br />-Look out.
975642 977019 Excuse us.
979897 982482 We've lost 58 doors this week, sir.
982983 984610 Kids these days.
984651 986862 They just don't get scared<br />like they used to.
987446 988947 Let her rip.
1000834 1002503 -Sir?<br />-What?
1002836 1004129 Look.
1005714 1008467 Attention.<br />We have a new scare leader.
1008509 1010177 Randall Boggs.
1011845 1013555 Look at those numbers.
1018936 1020437 Slumber party.
1023482 1024566 Never mind.
1026193 1027694 Hey, watch it.
1029404 1032616 Well, James,<br />that was an impressive display.
1032699 1034992 Just doing my job, Mr. Waternoose.
1035035 1037496 'Course I did learn from the best.
1038121 1041040 If I don't see a new door<br />in my station in five seconds,
1041124 1044211 I will personally<br />put you through the shredder.
1045378 1049341 Hey, Wazowski, nice job.<br />Those numbers are pretty sweet.
1049383 1051969 Are they?<br />You know, I hadn't even noticed.
1052052 1054721 -And how's Georgie doing?<br />-He's doing great.
1054805 1056849 I love working with that big guy.
1056890 1059393 Keep the doors coming.<br />I'm on a roll today.
1059434 1063188 George and I are like brothers. 2319!
1063272 1064398 We have a 2319!
1069820 1071071 Red alert.
1071738 1074116 Red alert, red alert.
1074199 1076326 -Red alert.<br />-George Sanderson.
1076410 1080372 Please remain motionless.<br />Prepare for decontamination.
1080414 1082416 Duck and cover, people!
1085586 1087754 Not the CDA.
1095137 1098182 -Go, go, go.<br />-Coming through. Stand aside.
1098265 1099766 Clear the contaminated area.
1100434 1104605 -A 2319 in progress.<br />-Coming through. Watch yourself.
1108984 1111278 Stand back. Careful.
1126668 1130130 All clear. Situation is<br />niner-niner-zero. Ready for decon.
1130214 1133467 -Thanks, guys, that was a close one.<br />-OK.
1145354 1148857 Take a break. We gotta shut down<br />and reset the system.
1148941 1151485 An entire scare floor out of commission.
1151527 1153487 What else can go wrong?
1156198 1159117 -What a day.<br />-We're just going through a rough time.
1159159 1161411 Everyone knows<br />you'll get us through it.
1161495 1163997 Tell that to the board of directors.
1165123 1169628 James, this company's been<br />in my family for three generations.
1169670 1172673 I would do anything<br />to keep it from going under.
1172756 1173757 So would I, sir.
1176593 1179513 -I could use your help with something.<br />-Anything, sir.
1179596 1184059 We've hired some new scare recruits,<br />and frankly, they're...
1184810 1187312 -Inexperienced?<br />-They stink.
1187855 1190065 I thought maybe<br />you might come by tomorrow
1190148 1192192 and give them a demonstration.
1192359 1195237 Show them what it takes<br />to be our top scarer.
1195320 1198657 I'll start out with the old<br />Waternoose jump and growl.
1202244 1203871 Now that's my boy.
1210460 1213714 Let's go, everybody.<br />All doors must be returned.
1213797 1215549 No exceptions.
1221513 1224224 I've never seen anything like you today.<br />You were on a roll.
1224266 1227102 Another day like this<br />and that scare record's in the bag.
1227227 1228312 That's right, baby.
1233192 1236612 As if dinner wasn't enough,<br />I'm taking her to a monster truck rally.
1236737 1238238 -Nice.<br />-What's on your agenda?
1238280 1240741 -Work out some more.<br />-Again?
1240908 1243410 There's more to life than scaring.
1244077 1249291 -Can I borrow your odorant?<br />-I got smelly garbage or old dumpster.
1249374 1252294 You got low tide?<br />How about wet dog?
1252377 1253921 Yep. Stink it up.
1257090 1259760 I am so romantic sometimes<br />I think I should marry myself.
1259801 1262846 -Give me a break.<br />-What a night of romance ahead of me.
1262930 1266225 Tonight is about me and Celia.
1266683 1269603 The love boat is about to set sail.
1270687 1274608 I gotta tell you, that face of hers,<br />it just makes my heart go...
1274775 1278987 Hello, Wazowski.<br />Fun-filled evening planned for tonight?
1279071 1280322 Well, as a matter of fact...
1280405 1283784 I'm sure you filed<br />your paperwork correctly,
1284117 1285494 for once.
1286662 1290290 Your stunned silence<br />is very reassuring.
1290499 1292793 My scare reports.<br />I left them on my desk.
1292876 1296255 If I'm not at the restaurant in five<br />minutes they'll give our table away.
1296338 1297923 -Schmoopsie-pooh.<br />-Googly bear.
1297965 1300843 -Want to get going?<br />-Do I ever. It's just...
1300926 1302261 -What?<br />-It...
1302302 1304513 -A small...<br />-I don't understand.
1304596 1306974 I forgot about some paperwork<br />I was supposed to file.
1307057 1308809 Mike was reminding me.
1308851 1310769 -Thanks, buddy.<br />-I was?
1311103 1312354 I mean, I was. Yeah.
1312437 1314565 -OK. Let's go.<br />-We're going.
1315649 1316650 The pink copies to accounting.
1316692 1320445 The fuchsia ones go to purchasing<br />and the goldenrod ones go to Roz.
1320487 1321989 Leave the puce.
1324825 1327494 Pink copies to accounting,<br />fuchsia ones to Roz.
1327578 1329621 The fuchsia ones go to purchasing.
1329746 1331415 The goldenrod ones go to Roz.
1331915 1334418 Man, I have no idea what puce is.
1337713 1339006 Oh, that's puce.
1344511 1345971 Hello?
1346180 1349600 Anyone? There's a door here.
1370412 1372206 Hello? Hey.
1373415 1374958 Anybody scaring in here?
1375709 1377920 Hello. Yo.
1489698 1490824 Kitty.
1491909 1493660 No, no, stay back.
1556473 1558141 Hold it, hold it.
1567734 1571572 Michael, I've had a lot of birthdays...<br />Well, not a lot of birthdays.
1571655 1573949 But this is the best birthday ever.
1575784 1577119 What are you looking at?
1577202 1580289 I was just thinking about<br />the first time I laid eye on you,
1580372 1582833 -how pretty you looked.<br />-Stop it.
1582916 1586628 -Your hair was shorter.<br />-I'm thinking about getting it cut.
1586712 1588630 No, no, I like it this length.
1588839 1590215 I like everything about you.
1590757 1594303 Just the other day someone asked<br />who was the most beautiful monster.
1595220 1597347 -You know what I said?<br />-What did you say?
1597431 1598724 I said...
1599266 1600934 -Sulley?<br />-Sulley?
1600976 1603520 No, no, that's not what<br />I was gonna say.
1603604 1604688 You're not making sense.
1604771 1608650 -He's handsome. He's rugged.<br />-What a coincidence, running into you.
1608942 1611320 -I'm just gonna order something.<br />-Michael.
1611612 1614072 -What's good?<br />-You're ruining everything.
1614114 1616992 I went to get your paperwork<br />and there was a door.
1617075 1618202 What?
1620579 1622331 -A door?<br />-Randall was in it.
1622414 1625959 Randall? That cheater.<br />He's trying to boost his numbers.
1626001 1627669 -There's something else.<br />-What?
1627753 1629796 Ooklay in the agbay.
1630130 1632007 -What?<br />-Look in the bag.
1633050 1634259 What bag?
1641975 1645354 They don't have anything<br />I like here. Take care, Celia.
1645437 1648690 -What's going on?<br />-Celia, please try to understand.
1648941 1651860 -I have to do something!<br />-Michael?
1652903 1655697 On three. One, two...
1658617 1659743 -A kid!<br />-Boo!
1664623 1665791 A kid!
1667543 1669670 There's a kid here.<br />A human kid!
1673715 1675133 Googly bear!
1681765 1683016 Come on.
1687187 1688605 Let's get out of here.
1688981 1692359 Please remain calm.<br />This is not a drill.
1694778 1696989 7835 in progress, please advise.
1697447 1700200 -Michael? Michael!<br />-Celia!
1700284 1701743 -Come with me.<br />-Stop pushing.
1701827 1703745 Get your hands off<br />my schmoopsie-pooh.
1704830 1706331 Ready for decontamination.
1706999 1710043 I don't think that date<br />could have gone any worse.
1716383 1719970 If witnesses are to be believed,<br />there has been a child security breach
1720053 1722347 for the first time in monster history.
1722389 1725893 We neither confirm nor deny<br />the presence of a human child here.
1725976 1730230 Well, a kid flew right over me and<br />blasted a car with its laser vision.
1730272 1733525 I tried to run, but it picked me up<br />with its mind powers
1733567 1734902 and shook me like a doll.
1734943 1737196 It's true.<br />I saw the whole thing.
1737237 1742492 It is my professional opinion<br />that now is the time to panic.
1747206 1749208 It's coming. It's coming!
1750083 1751210 Boo!
1757841 1759551 No, no, no, no!
1760135 1761512 Come here, kid.
1763931 1766266 Don't touch those, you little...
1766350 1768769 Those were alphabetized.<br />It's OK.
1768810 1772272 As long as it doesn't come near us<br />we're gonna be OK.
1781990 1784117 You like this? Fetch.
1786453 1789414 Hey, hey. That's it.<br />No one touches Little Mikey.
1792125 1794044 Mike, give her the bear.
1795546 1797089 Oh, no!
1811562 1813480 Make it stop, Sulley.<br />Make it stop!
1813564 1816650 Here, look. See bear?<br />Nice bear.
1817150 1818235 Sulley!
1819486 1822239 Bear, he's a happy bear.
1822322 1825158 He's not crying, neither should you.<br />We'll be in trouble
1825242 1829162 'cause they're gonna find us,<br />so please stop crying now.
1829246 1831790 Good. Good, Sulley. Keep it up.<br />You're doing great.
1831832 1833834 He's a happy bear.<br />He has no...
1835335 1837588 -It touched me.<br />-Sulley, the bear!
1837671 1840007 The bear. Give her the...
1850517 1852352 What was that?
1852394 1857524 I have no idea, but it would be<br />really great if it didn't do it again.
1878504 1881048 How could I do this?<br />How could I be so stupid?
1881089 1884551 -This could destroy the company.<br />-Who cares about the company?
1884593 1888013 What about us?<br />That thing is a killing machine.
1889223 1892434 It's waiting for us to fall asleep<br />and then wham!
1892935 1896021 We're easy prey, my friend.<br />We're sitting targets.
1896730 1898899 OK, look, I think I have a plan here.
1898982 1902277 Using mainly spoons,<br />we dig a tunnel under the city
1902361 1904571 and release it into the wild.
1904947 1906198 Spoons.
1907324 1910577 That's it. I'm out of ideas.<br />Air balloon, too expensive.
1910661 1914790 Giant slingshot, too conspicuous.<br />Enormous wooden horse, too Greek.
1917334 1920420 No. Can't think. Can't think.
1921255 1923674 -Flatliner. Flatlining.<br />-Mike?
1924007 1926134 I think she's getting tired.
1926426 1930097 Well, then why don't you<br />find someplace for it to sleep
1930264 1932349 while I think of a plan!
1934393 1937187 Are you sleepy? Wanna sleep?
1937354 1939439 Is that what you want?
1953120 1956039 OK. I'll make a nice little area<br />for you to...
1956123 1960127 No. Hey, that's my bed.<br />You're gonna get your germs all over it.
1962462 1965174 Fine.<br />My chair's more comfortable anyway.
1966717 1968260 What?
1970429 1973098 It's just a closet.<br />Will you go to sleep?
1976476 1978312 Hey, that looks like Randall.
1979229 1981148 Randall's your monster.
1981648 1984276 You think he's gonna<br />come through the closet and scare you.
1984318 1986320 Oh, boy, how do I explain this?
1986361 1987738 It's empty.
1988030 1989239 See?
1989740 1991325 No monster in here.
1994995 1996330 Well, now there is.
1996371 1998498 But I'm not gonna scare you.
1999208 2000667 I'm off duty.
2004505 2005672 OK.
2006006 2010302 How about I sit here<br />until you fall asleep?
2012054 2014181 Go ahead. Go to sleep.
2015224 2017768 Now. Now go.
2018977 2023190 You go to sleep.
2057306 2061061 Mike, this might sound crazy,<br />but I don't think that kid's dangerous.
2061228 2063772 Really? Well, in that case,<br />let's keep it.
2063856 2065815 I always wanted a pet<br />that could kill me!
2065899 2068235 What if we just<br />put her back in her door?
2068318 2070070 -What?<br />-Mike, think about it.
2070112 2073739 We send her back,<br />everything goes back to normal.
2073991 2076577 Is that a joke?<br />Tell me you're joking.
2077119 2079246 Sulley, I think that given<br />the circumstance
2079329 2081164 I've been extremely forgiving till now.
2081248 2082748 But that is a horrible idea.
2082791 2085543 Are we gonna march in public<br />with that thing?
2085793 2088463 Then I guess we waltz<br />right up to the factory, right?
2089922 2093260 I can't believe we are waltzing<br />right up to the factory.
2093635 2096597 Sulley, a mop, a couple of lights<br />and some chair fabric
2096679 2099391 are not gonna fool anyone.<br />Think about names.
2099433 2101768 Loch Ness. Bigfoot.<br />The Abominable Snowman.
2101810 2104563 They all got one thing in common.<br />Banishment!
2104605 2107274 -We could be next.<br />-Don't panic. We can do this.
2107357 2109443 -How you doing, Frank?<br />-Hey, guys.
2109484 2111945 Everything's going to be OK.
2116658 2118619 Number one wants this<br />dusted for prints.
2118660 2121288 -Careful with that.<br />-I got a good view.
2121705 2123165 A little lower.
2123665 2125501 This was recovered at the scene.
2125584 2127461 -Don't panic.<br />-Don't tell me not to.
2127544 2129213 -Keep it together.<br />-It's not OK.
2129796 2131590 -Boo.<br />-Could be contaminated.
2131632 2134259 Gentlemen, safety<br />is our number-one concern.
2134301 2137262 If there's anything that...<br />Not now. I'm...
2137304 2139139 Oh, hello, little one.
2139181 2141475 -Where did you come from?<br />-Mr. Waternoose!
2141642 2143644 James, is this one yours?
2143727 2145938 Actually, that's my cousin's sister's
2145979 2148148 -daughter, sir.<br />-Yeah, it's...
2148273 2151318 Bring an Obscure Relative<br />to Work Day.
2152069 2154696 Must have missed the memo.<br />Well, listen, James,
2154780 2157157 why don't you stop by the simulator<br />after lunch
2157199 2159952 and give us that scare demonstration?
2159993 2161787 Yeah. Oh, sir...
2161828 2164206 -Mr. Waternoose?<br />-Yes, yes. I'm coming.
2164665 2166667 I'll see you this afternoon, James.
2166834 2169920 That is, if these gentlemen<br />haven't shut us down.
2170003 2171755 -Oh, boy.<br />-A scare demo.
2171839 2173674 That is great.<br />Why am I the last to know?
2173715 2177261 We could bring your cousin's sister's<br />daughter. She'll be a big hit.
2178178 2179513 Halt.
2180973 2182391 Hold him down.
2186436 2187938 Come on. The coast is clear.
2188355 2190607 OK. All we have to do<br />is get rid of that thing.
2190691 2192526 So wait here while I get its card.
2192609 2195571 She can't stay here.<br />This is the men's room.
2196363 2198323 That is the weirdest thing<br />you've ever said.
2199032 2202035 Look. It loves it here.<br />It's dancing with joy.
2202995 2205455 I'll be right back with its door key.
2207207 2210878 That's a cute little dance.<br />It almost looks like you've got to...
2225893 2227561 Are you done in there?
2229813 2231440 Sorry, sorry.
2244369 2246580 OK. You're finished now, right?
2247080 2248290 Hello?
2252169 2253295 Boo.
2263931 2265349 Where did she go?
2266683 2268268 Did she disappear?
2268602 2270979 Did she turn invisible?
2271772 2274066 I just have no idea.
2275108 2276443 Gotcha.
2277569 2278612 Boo.
2281448 2283283 Hey, you're good.
2289331 2291834 Be relaxed. Be relaxed. Be relaxed.
2292417 2296004 Roz, my tender oozing blossom.<br />You're looking fabulous today.
2296088 2299341 Is that a new haircut?<br />Tell me, it's a new haircut.
2300342 2303095 New makeup. You had a lift.<br />You had a tuck. You had something.
2303136 2307307 Something has been inserted in<br />your skin that makes you look like...
2308725 2312771 I need a favor. Randall was working<br />late last night on the scare floor.
2312813 2315566 I need the key<br />for the door he was using.
2315691 2318527 Well, isn't that nice?
2318610 2322531 But guess what? You didn't turn in<br />your paperwork last night.
2322614 2324658 He didn't... No paperwork?
2324700 2327452 This office is now closed.
2329872 2332249 Ready or not, here I come.
2332332 2333667 I'm getting warmer.
2333709 2335377 Any second now.
2335460 2339339 -Fee, fi, fo...<br />-What are you doing?
2340048 2341508 I'm looking for the kid.
2341550 2344178 -You lost it?<br />-No, no. She was just...
2345804 2347055 Here she is.
2347139 2348765 Hey. What's the matter?
2348849 2352019 -I already told your buddies...<br />-All right. Carry on.
2364531 2368285 Randall. Thank goodness.<br />What are we gonna do about the child?
2389181 2392518 It's on the front page.<br />The child. The one you were after.
2392559 2395938 Be quiet. Don't you think<br />I'm aware of the situation?
2396021 2398106 I was up all night trying to find it.
2398190 2402319 I did a calculation factoring in<br />the size of the sushi restaurant.
2402402 2403946 The child may have escaped!
2404029 2406865 Until we know for sure<br />we're gonna act like nothing happened.
2407533 2408784 Get the machine running.<br />I'll take care of the kid.
2410577 2413622 When I find whoever let it out,<br />they're dead.
2415999 2419253 Why are you still here?<br />Come on, go! Move! Now!
2419336 2420546 I'm not here.
2421463 2422798 They're gone.
2427845 2429555 This is bad, so very bad.
2429596 2430931 What were they talking about,<br />machine?
2431014 2432432 Who cares?
2433600 2435894 All we have to do<br />is call her door and send her home.
2435936 2438689 Right. We're just two regular Joes<br />on our way to work.
2438772 2440607 We will blend right in.
2440774 2443277 -Top of the morning.<br />-What's shakin', bacon?
2443318 2445696 Did you lose weight?<br />Or a limb?
2445863 2448115 -You have her card key, right?<br />-Of course.
2448198 2450951 I told you I'd get her card key.<br />I went and got it.
2450993 2452953 Now I have her card key.
2454079 2455455 OK. Here we go.
2456456 2460127 Take care of yourself. Try not to<br />run through any more closets.
2463714 2466675 -Mike, that's not her door.<br />-Of course it's her door.
2466758 2469303 No. Her door was white<br />and it had flowers on it.
2469344 2472973 It must have been dark last night<br />because this is its door.
2473599 2476310 Hey, you hear that?<br />Sounds like fun in there.
2476351 2479438 Send me a postcard, kid.<br />That's Mike Wazowski, care of
2479521 2482274 22 Mike Wazowski,<br />you-got-your-life-back Lane.
2483525 2485444 Very good. Now bon voyage.
2485485 2489156 Bye-bye. Look at the stick.<br />See the stick? Go get the stick.
2489489 2492659 -Go fetch.<br />-Mike, this isn't Boo's door.
2492910 2496330 -Boo? What's Boo?<br />-That's what I decided to call her.
2496455 2497497 There a problem?
2497539 2498999 Sulley, you're not supposed to name it.
2499082 2501919 Once you name it,<br />you start getting attached to it.
2502002 2505631 Now put that thing back<br />where it came from, or so help me...
2509343 2514097 Hey. We're rehearsing a scene for<br />the upcoming company play called...
2514348 2517351 Put That Thing Back<br />Where It Came From or So Help Me.
2517935 2519228 It's a musical.
2519311 2521897 Put that thing back<br />where it came from or so help me
2521980 2523190 So help me, so help me
2523273 2524358 And cut.
2525025 2528612 We're still working on it.<br />It's in progress, but we need ushers.
2528695 2532658 Sulley, I've had enough.<br />Say goodbye to... Where did it go?
2532783 2535244 -Where is she?<br />-She got away from you again?
2535327 2539873 Well, that is just...<br />Wait a minute. The sun is coming up.
2539915 2541542 This is perfect.
2541625 2543001 She's gone!
2544211 2546004 Where are you going?<br />Sulley, don't blow this.
2546046 2547881 We're so close to breaking the record.
2547923 2550634 Somebody will find the kid.<br />It'll be their problem.
2550717 2552845 She's out of our hair!
2553720 2556765 -What are you two doing?<br />-They're rehearsing a play.
2556849 2559434 She's out of our hair
2559518 2563438 Can it! So, what do you think<br />of that kid getting out, Sullivan?
2563522 2565732 -Pretty crazy?<br />-Oh, yeah, crazy.
2565774 2568443 Word is the kid's been traced<br />to this factory.
2568527 2571071 -You haven't seen anything?<br />-Well...
2571363 2573073 No. No way.
2573156 2577411 But if it was an inside job,<br />I'd put my money on Waxford.
2577452 2579454 -Waxford?<br />-The one at station six.
2579538 2582374 -He's got them shifty eyes.<br />-Hey, Waxford.
2582666 2585294 -Sulley!<br />-Michael Wazowski!
2587921 2592509 Last night was one of the worst nights<br />of my entire life, bar none!
2594261 2597347 -I thought you cared about me.<br />-Honey, please.
2597431 2600601 -I thought you liked sushi.<br />-Sushi! Sushi!
2600642 2603437 You think this is about sushi?
2609067 2610152 Wazowski.
2610235 2611737 Michael!
2611778 2612779 Men.
2614489 2616116 Breathe. Keep breathing.
2627920 2629671 -Where's the kid?<br />-Kid?
2629755 2632925 -What kid?<br />-It's here in the factory, isn't it?
2634426 2637137 It never would have gotten out<br />if you hadn't been cheating last night.
2637804 2641266 Cheating? Cheating. Right.
2641642 2644770 OK. I think I know<br />how to make this all go away.
2645270 2649191 What happens when the whistle blows<br />in five minutes?
2649983 2653445 -I get a timeout?<br />-Everyone goes to lunch.
2654154 2657824 Which means the scare floor will be...
2659409 2661203 -Painted?<br />-Empty.
2661286 2663413 It'll be empty, you idiot.
2663705 2665082 You see that clock?
2665165 2669503 When the big hand is pointing up<br />and the little hand is pointing up,
2669628 2672005 the kid's door will be in my station.
2672172 2675133 But when the big hand points down,
2675676 2677219 the door will be gone.
2677719 2680389 You have until then to put the kid back.
2681098 2682724 Get the picture?
2693902 2695028 Boo!
2695821 2698073 -No.<br />-Hey, you. Halt.
2698490 2699658 He's the one.
2699700 2702202 -The one from the commercial.<br />-That's him.
2702286 2705789 -Can we get an autograph?<br />-Oh, sure. No problem.
2705873 2708250 Make that out to Stephanie,<br />my daughter.
2708333 2709459 Yes. Let's see.
2710043 2713088 "From your scary friend.<br />Best wishes..."
2713172 2717342 So, then I said, "If you talk to me<br />like that again, we're through".
2717801 2720220 -What'd she say?<br />-You know my mom.
2720304 2723182 -She sent me to my room.<br />-See you guys later. Take it easy.
2723223 2724558 Bottoms up.
2742034 2743118 Boo!
2747998 2749249 Hi.
2751126 2753670 Well, hello, there.<br />What's your name?
2753962 2755589 Mike Wazowski.
2794461 2796129 Sulley!
2796463 2798173 Oh, Sulley.
2799466 2801093 OK, Sulley, come on.
2801885 2803971 Hey! You guys seen Sulley anywhere?
2804012 2806306 -Nope, sorry.<br />-Sulley!
2806348 2809101 Boy, Wazowski<br />looks like he's in trouble.
2810519 2813313 2319! We have a 2319!
2813397 2815649 Oh, dear.
2816400 2817526 Sulley!
2817818 2818944 Sulley!
2822197 2824658 Sulley. Great news, pal.
2824741 2827244 I got us a way out of this mess,<br />but we gotta hurry.
2827327 2828787 Where is it?
2830622 2832833 Sull, that's a cube of garbage.
2835335 2838297 I can still hear her little voice.
2838547 2840716 -Mike Wazowski.<br />-I can hear it too.
2840799 2843552 -Mike Wazowski!<br />-How many kids you got in there?
2843635 2845179 Mike Wazowski!
2846722 2848390 -Kitty!<br />-Boo!
2850350 2853604 Boo, you're all right.<br />I was so worried. I was...
2854396 2857649 Don't you ever<br />run away from me again, young lady.
2858483 2861111 But I'm so glad you're safe.
2861528 2864364 My, what an affectionate father.
2864448 2867284 Actually, she's my cousin's sister's...
2867576 2869870 -That's enough. Let's go.<br />-Mike Wazowski.
2869953 2872497 Yeah. Step aside, kid.<br />We're in a...
2879546 2882925 -Will you stop making Boo laugh?<br />-I didn't. Come on.
2886470 2889056 I still don't understand.<br />You got Boo's door?
2889097 2891308 I'll explain later. Run.
2891391 2895103 Let's move, let's move. Come on.<br />Please be there. Please be there.
2895395 2898232 -There it is, just like Randall said.<br />-Randall?
2898398 2900734 Wait a minute. Boo, hey.
2900817 2903570 One, two, three, four,<br />get the kid through the door.
2904154 2907741 -The nightmare is over.<br />-It's OK, Boo. What's the matter?
2907824 2910327 -It's time to move.<br />-Mike, what are you thinking?
2910410 2913121 -Randall's after Boo.<br />-Who cares? Let's go.
2913205 2916208 -This is a limited-time offer.<br />-No. I don't like this.
2916250 2918877 Sulley, you wanted her door<br />and there it is.
2918919 2921421 -Now let's move.<br />-No, Mike.
2922130 2924258 You want me to prove<br />everything's on the up and up?
2924341 2926343 -He wants a door, I get a door.<br />-Wait.
2926426 2928470 Paranoid delusional furball.
2930681 2931932 Mike!
2990741 2993160 Hey, Sulley, where you been all day?
2993243 2995245 Sulley? Sulley!
3011845 3013555 Mike? Mike?
3014515 3015766 Where are you?
3016183 3017518 Are you in there?
3018101 3019603 Where are you, buddy?
3020187 3021396 Mike?
3021939 3023440 Where are you?
3033617 3035244 Boo, way to go.
3043168 3044586 It's OK.
3062729 3065357 Randall, did you have to...
3074324 3077661 -Yes! I got the kid.<br />-Oh, huzzah!
3077744 3081707 -Great news. Not that I was concerned.<br />-Get over here and help me.
3082249 3084877 Come on, while we're young here,<br />Fungus.
3088922 3091508 The kid needs to take off a few pounds.
3095888 3098932 Wazowski! Where is it,<br />you little one-eyed cretin?
3099016 3102060 It's cretin. If you're gonna<br />threaten me, do it properly.
3102102 3104271 Second, you're nuts if you think<br />kidnapping me
3104354 3106231 is gonna help you cheat!
3108775 3112029 You still think this is about<br />that stupid scare record?
3112112 3113697 Well, I did.
3113780 3118619 Right up until you chuckled like that.<br />Now I think I should get out of here.
3119286 3122456 I'm about to revolutionize<br />the scaring industry.
3122497 3125459 When I do,<br />even the great James P. Sullivan
3125542 3127294 is gonna be working for me.
3127377 3130464 Well, somebody's certainly<br />been a busy bee.
3130547 3133967 First I need to know where the kid is<br />and you're gonna tell me.
3134051 3135886 -I don't know.<br />-Sure.
3135969 3138013 I don't. I don't.
3140474 3143310 What's that? Wait.<br />Wait, wait, wait, wait.
3144102 3146104 Come on. No, no.<br />Come on. Hey, hey.
3146146 3148148 Hey, hey. This thing is moving.
3149733 3153070 I don't like big moving things<br />that are moving towards me.
3153362 3154821 No. Come on. Hey!
3155072 3159743 -Randall!<br />-Say hello to the scream extractor.
3160494 3161620 Hello.
3161828 3164915 Where you going?<br />We'll talk. We'll have a latte.
3165165 3167918 Come on. We can talk about this.
3172089 3173757 What is that thing?
3174174 3176510 Wait, wait, wait.<br />No, no, no.
3176552 3178345 No. Come on.
3179972 3182683 Help. Help! Help, help!
3189898 3192109 For... What did you do wrong this time?
3192192 3195487 -I don't know. I calibrated the...<br />-Go check the machine.
3195529 3198365 There must be something wrong<br />with the scream intake valve.
3219011 3222139 Fungus? Fungus? You like cars?
3222639 3227019 I got a really nice car. If you<br />let me go, I'll give you a ride
3227060 3229479 in the car.<br />Please, Fungus.
3229563 3232608 I'm sorry, Wazowski,<br />but Randall said I'm not allowed
3232691 3235569 to fraternize with victims<br />of his evil plot.
3247831 3250292 What happened?<br />Where's Wazowski?
3253545 3255214 Where is he?
3260969 3263680 -Come on.<br />-This is crazy. He's gonna kill us.
3263764 3265432 That could be contaminated.
3265516 3267434 We gotta get out of here now!
3267518 3271104 We could start a new life far away.<br />Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.
3271188 3273232 Goodbye, Mr. Waternoose.
3273273 3275776 -No, Mike, wait.<br />-Hey, what are you doing?
3275859 3279947 -Follow me. I have an idea.<br />-No, no, no, no, no.
3280531 3283784 -Simulation terminated.<br />-No, no, no, no, no.
3283867 3287871 What was that? You're trying<br />to scare the kid, not lull it to sleep.
3287955 3290832 I was going for a snake/ninja approach
3290916 3292835 with a little hissing.
3293794 3297631 How many times do I have to tell you?<br />It's all about presence.
3297673 3301051 -About how you enter the room.<br />-Mr. Waternoose!
3301134 3302970 James, perfect timing.
3303053 3305013 No, no, sir. You don't understand.
3305097 3307724 -Show these monsters how it's done.<br />-I can't.
3307808 3310477 -Sir, you have to listen to me.<br />-Pay attention.
3310519 3313063 You're about to see<br />the best in the business.
3313146 3315858 -Reset the simulator.<br />-But sir!
3315941 3317818 -Good night, sweetheart.<br />-'Night, Mom.
3318151 3319820 -Kitty!<br />-No, Boo, no!
3319903 3323615 -Give us a big loud roar.<br />-There's no time for this!
3323657 3326451 -What are you waiting for? Roar.<br />-But, sir...
3326493 3328036 Roar!
3338755 3341842 Well done. Well done, James.
3342134 3343343 -Boo?<br />-All right, gentlemen.
3343427 3346763 -Right this way.<br />-I hope you've learned a lesson today.
3351268 3352477 Boo.
3356857 3358108 Boo.
3362946 3365032 Boo, it's me.
3367784 3370204 -The child!<br />-Sir, she isn't toxic.
3370329 3372915 -It sounds crazy, but trust me.<br />-Boo?
3373415 3375167 No, no, no, no, it's OK.
3375209 3376877 I was just... No.
3376919 3381006 No, don't be scared.<br />That wasn't real.
3381048 3383967 It's just a... I was just...
3397648 3400984 -Boo.<br />-...test it out on that sweet girl.
3401652 3404112 -Boo.<br />-...have her, he is trying to kill us.
3404238 3406323 -This is Randall's fault.<br />-Randall?
3406406 3409910 We can take you to his secret lab<br />in this factory.
3409993 3413830 How could this happen?<br />How could this happen?
3414915 3417042 Does anyone else know about this?
3417084 3418502 -No, sir.<br />-Good.
3418961 3422172 This company can't afford<br />any more bad publicity.
3422548 3425008 Now, before we do anything else,
3425092 3428220 let's take care of the child.
3432516 3434935 I never thought<br />things would come to this.
3435310 3437020 Not in my factory.
3438438 3441441 I'm sorry you boys got mixed up in this.
3441525 3443443 Especially you, James.
3443485 3446488 But now we can<br />set everything straight again.
3446989 3448115 For the good of the company.
3452619 3454538 Sir? That's not her door.
3454621 3456456 I know, I know.
3459501 3461003 It's yours.
3465382 3466508 No!
3468886 3470846 Boo!
3476518 3480731 No! No! No, no, no, no!
3482232 3484818 It's too late.<br />We're banished, genius!
3484902 3486862 We're in the human world.
3486945 3490157 What a great idea,<br />going to your old pal Waternoose.
3490324 3492576 Too bad he was in on the whole thing.
3492659 3495037 All you had to do was listen to me.
3495120 3499291 Just once!<br />But you didn't, did you?
3499416 3501710 You're still not listening!
3508550 3510010 Take that!
3515516 3518101 Welcome to the Himalayas.
3521355 3524358 Abominable. Can you believe that?
3524399 3526235 Do I look abominable to you?
3526401 3528654 Why can't they call me<br />the Adorable Snowman
3528695 3531740 or the Agreeable Snowman,<br />for crying out loud?
3531949 3534576 I'm a nice guy.<br />Snow cone?
3535536 3538205 No, don't worry. It's lemon.
3539122 3541708 How about you, big fella?<br />Snow cone?
3544336 3547130 Did you see the way she looked at me?
3550133 3553720 Poor guy. I understand.<br />It ain't easy being banished.
3554054 3555472 Take my buddy, Bigfoot.
3555556 3559768 When he was banished, he fashioned<br />an enormous diaper out of poison ivy.
3560018 3561895 Wore it on his head like a tiara.
3561937 3565816 Called himself King Itchy.<br />It won't be so hard for you guys.
3565941 3567359 How lucky can you get?
3567401 3570821 -Banished with your best friend.<br />-He is not my friend.
3571071 3574867 I just assumed you were buddies.<br />When I saw you in the snow hugging...
3574908 3577953 Look at that big jerk.<br />Ruined my life. And for what?
3578036 3579288 A stupid kid!
3579371 3582666 Because of you I am now stuck<br />in this frozen wasteland.
3582749 3586044 Wasteland?<br />I think you mean wonderland.
3586086 3588547 How about all this fabulous snow?
3589047 3591258 And wait till you see<br />the local village.
3591341 3595304 Cutest thing in the world.<br />I haven't mentioned the free yaks' milk.
3595971 3597973 -What did you say?<br />-Yaks' milk.
3598056 3600184 Milking a yak ain't exactly a picnic.
3600267 3602644 Once you pick the hairs out<br />it's nutritious.
3602728 3605189 No, about a village.<br />Are there kids in it?
3605272 3608525 Kids? Sure. Tough kids, sissy kids,<br />kids who climb on rocks.
3608609 3611069 -Where is it?<br />-At the bottom of the mountain.
3611111 3613947 -A three-day hike.<br />-Three days?
3613989 3615991 We need to get there now.
3626460 3628253 You wanna go to the village?
3628295 3632424 Rule number one out here,<br />always... No.
3633008 3635010 Never go out in a blizzard.
3635135 3637429 We need to get to Boo.
3639640 3641558 Boo? What about us?
3642643 3645646 Ever since the kid came in,<br />you've ignored everything I've said,
3645687 3650859 and now look where we are!<br />We were about to break the record.
3650943 3654404 -We would have had it made.<br />-None of that matters now.
3655155 3657491 None of it matters?<br />Wait a second.
3657699 3659701 None of it matters?
3662079 3664623 OK. No, good. Great.
3665374 3667835 So now the truth comes out, doesn't it?
3669461 3672798 Would you look at that?<br />We're out of snow cones.
3672840 3675676 Let me just go outside<br />and make some more.
3677052 3680180 Sulley, what about everything<br />we ever worked for?
3681014 3682766 Does that matter?
3684142 3685686 What about Celia?
3685769 3689022 I am never...<br />Never gonna see her again.
3689940 3691733 Doesn't that matter?
3696864 3698282 And what about me?
3699157 3701702 I'm your pal. I'm your best friend.
3702870 3704371 Don't I matter?
3707541 3709168 I'm sorry, Mike.
3709376 3711378 I'm sorry we're stuck out here.
3711837 3713881 I didn't mean for this to happen.
3714256 3716133 But Boo's in trouble.
3716300 3719386 I think there might be<br />a way to save her if we can just get...
3719469 3721972 We? Whoa. We?
3722181 3725601 No. There's no "we" this time, pal.
3725976 3729396 If you want to go out there<br />and freeze to death,
3729938 3731565 you be my guest.
3732524 3734651 Because you're on your own.
3771730 3773941 Hey, I got more snow cones!
3821154 3824199 Come on, George.<br />I know you can do this.
3824324 3826493 I picked out an easy door for you.
3826618 3829746 In Nepal. Nice, quiet Nepal.
3829830 3832916 You know, you're right.<br />Here. Take this.
3833000 3834751 Go get 'em, Georgie.
3834877 3836336 Look out. Coming through.
3836420 3839173 -Sorry, George.<br />-Hey, you can't just...
3840007 3841550 Twenty-three...
3846972 3848640 Out of the way!
3854021 3857065 Finally. I never should have<br />trusted you with this.
3857149 3860152 Because of you,<br />I had to banish my top scarer.
3860235 3862446 With this machine,<br />we won't need scarers.
3862529 3864698 Sullivan got what he deserved.
3864740 3867868 Sullivan was twice the scarer<br />you will ever be.
3881757 3883050 Kitty!
3889973 3891725 -Kitty!<br />-Sullivan?
3898065 3900234 -Kitty!<br />-Sorry, Boo.
3900400 3902027 Stop him!
3902653 3904404 Let's get you home.
3907991 3909409 Finish him off!
3916959 3920796 You don't know how long<br />I've wanted to do that, Sullivan.
3933350 3934434 Mike?
3934476 3937020 -It's not that I don't care.<br />-Mike, you don't understand.
3937104 3939231 Yes, I do.<br />I was just mad, that's all.
3939273 3943610 I needed some time to think, but<br />you shouldn't have left me out there.
3944236 3946655 -I'm being attacked.<br />-I'm not attacking you.
3946738 3950242 I'm trying to be honest. Hear me out.<br />You and I are a team.
3950325 3952911 Nothing is more important<br />than our friendship.
3952953 3955080 I know. He's too sensitive.
3957499 3960419 Come on, pal.<br />If you start crying, I'm gonna cry.
3960460 3962629 And I'll never get through this.
3962713 3965799 I'm sorry I wasn't there for you,<br />but I am now.
3965841 3970262 Sulley, I am baring my soul here.<br />The least you can do is pay attention.
3974433 3976518 Look at that. It's Randall.
3978103 3979313 Come on.
3979938 3982566 Get up. There can't be any witnesses.
3982649 3983692 There won't be.
3984318 3985986 I'm glad you came back, Mike.
3986069 3989323 Somebody's gotta take care of you,<br />you big hairball.
3992659 3995037 -Schmoopsie-pooh, I can't talk.<br />-Come on.
3995120 3999625 Michael, if you don't tell me what's<br />going on right now, we are through!
4000125 4001168 Here's the truth.
4001251 4005506 The kid? Sulley let her in. We tried to<br />send her back, Waternoose had a plot,
4005589 4008008 and now Randall's trying to kill us!
4008050 4011470 You expect me to believe<br />that pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?
4011512 4013096 Mike Wazowski.
4013847 4016058 I love you, schmoopsie-pooh!
4016141 4019228 -Hey!<br />-Idiots.
4020229 4021897 Look out. Coming through.
4021980 4024733 Make way. Move it.<br />Hurry up, hurry up.
4026318 4028820 -There they are.<br />-Attention, employees.
4028862 4032866 Randall Boggs has just broken<br />the all-time scare record.
4033534 4035994 No, I didn't.<br />Get out of my way.
4036620 4038539 Go get 'em, googly bear.
4040040 4041124 There it is.
4041208 4043877 Get off my tail. Let go.
4047714 4049216 -What are you doing?<br />-Grab on, Mike.
4049258 4052219 Are you out of your mind?
4062104 4065315 -Sulley, what are we doing?<br />-Get Boo's door and find a station.
4065399 4067901 What a plan.<br />Simple, yet insane.
4081707 4083250 -Whoa.<br />-Oh, boy.
4083750 4085377 Hold on!
4094094 4095721 Don't look down!
4111612 4113322 I'm gonna be sick.
4117533 4118827 Oh, no.
4122788 4124041 No!
4125417 4127502 -Boo's door.<br />-There it is.
4127711 4130296 How are we supposed to get to it now?
4133591 4135219 It's a dead end, Sulley.
4136970 4138471 -There he is.<br />-Make her laugh.
4138514 4140307 -Sulley!<br />-Just do it!
4149858 4152069 -Get it open.<br />-Here he comes.
4152152 4153819 Give me that kid.
4158825 4162828 -Why couldn't we get banished here?<br />-We gotta find another door.
4168167 4169920 Look! Boo's door.
4174550 4177386 -There he is. Hurry up!<br />-Give me your hand.
4184309 4186937 -Come on, it slides.<br />-Right. Right.
4190691 4192651 Jump. I'm right behind you.
4197364 4198782 Come on.
4200742 4202202 Hurry up. Keep moving!
4202286 4203996 Get inside.
4204872 4206540 That was weird.
4207040 4208333 Mike?
4208375 4210627 -Sorry, buddy.<br />-OK.
4218468 4220596 I hope that hurt, lizard boy.
4225392 4227394 Great job, buddy. We lost him.
4227519 4228729 Boo!
4230189 4231440 No!
4233525 4235611 Nice working with you.
4235694 4237112 -Get it open!<br />-I'm trying!
4237196 4239865 -Open the door!<br />-Come on, get in here.
4249499 4250709 Boo!
4254129 4255672 There they are!
4259468 4262054 Sulley, what are you doing?<br />Sulley!
4266266 4269186 -Looks like we caught the express.<br />-Do you see them?
4269269 4270938 Straight ahead.
4294670 4296171 -Kitty.<br />-Boo.
4302928 4306348 Look at everybody's<br />favorite scarer now.
4306431 4309560 You stupid, pathetic waste.
4312563 4316817 You've been number one for too long,<br />Sullivan. Now your time is up.
4317609 4322197 And don't worry.<br />I'll take good care of the kid.
4322322 4323490 No!
4345179 4347514 She's not scared of you anymore.
4348807 4351101 Looks like you're out of a job.
4352186 4355105 OK, over the plate.<br />Let's see the old stuff.
4355189 4357065 Chuck him, baby.
4357149 4361111 Here's the pitch and he is out of here.
4361862 4365282 -Mama, another gator got in the house.<br />-Another gator?
4365365 4367451 Give me that shovel. There!
4368035 4370162 Get him, Mama. Get that gator.
4372122 4375209 -Care to do the honors, Mikey?<br />-With pleasure.
4384801 4386887 That's right, Boo. You did it.
4386929 4388555 You beat him.
4388764 4390182 Come on.
4393185 4394686 OK, Boo, it's time to go home.
4394728 4397689 Take care of yourself<br />and be a good girl, OK?
4398941 4401735 -Oh, no.<br />-The power's out. Make her laugh.
4401777 4404863 I got a move here<br />that'll bring down the house.
4408742 4410994 -Sorry. She didn't see that.<br />-What?
4411078 4414206 What, did you forget to check<br />if her hood was up, you big dope?
4414248 4417251 Uncle Mike, try not to yell<br />in front of her.
4417376 4420087 -You know we need her to laugh.<br />-Right.
4420379 4422631 Hey, Boo. Just kidding. Look.
4423173 4425217 Funny, right? See, with the...
4425259 4428762 These are the jokes, kid.<br />What's happening?
4429596 4430722 Hold on.
4431598 4434309 When the door lands in the station,<br />cut the power.
4434393 4438772 You'll have the child and the criminals<br />responsible for this whole mess.
4440274 4443277 Great. A welcoming committee.<br />What are we gonna do?
4455789 4460294 This is the CDA. Come out slowly<br />with the child in plain sight.
4460377 4463005 OK, OK, you got us.
4463297 4464965 Here we are. Here's the kid.
4465007 4469261 I'll cooperate, but before you<br />take us away, I have one thing to say.
4470470 4472556 -Catch.<br />-2319.
4473140 4475184 We have a toxic projectile.
4475893 4479104 -After the suspect.<br />-Stop him!
4482357 4484818 -Come on.<br />-Don't let them get away.
4487196 4489740 Wait. Come back.<br />He has the child.
4495370 4497497 Sullivan. Sullivan!
4497581 4501335 Give me the child. Give her to me!
4510302 4513055 Open this door.<br />Open this door!
4519019 4520229 Stop it.
4520479 4521939 Don't do it.
4523398 4525692 -Come on.<br />-Don't go in that room.
4529696 4532616 I think we stopped him, Boo.<br />You're safe now.
4532699 4534576 You be a good girl, OK?
4535869 4539540 -This has gone far enough, James.<br />-She's home. Leave her alone.
4539581 4542209 I can't do that. She's seen too much.
4542334 4545003 -You both have.<br />-It doesn't have to be this way.
4545045 4547840 I have no choice. Times have changed.
4547881 4550968 -Scaring isn't enough anymore.<br />-But kidnapping?
4551051 4554388 I'll kidnap 1,000 children<br />before I let the company die.
4554429 4557724 And I'll silence anyone<br />who gets in my way!
4559142 4560561 No!
4560644 4562145 -Night, Mom.<br />-Night, sweetheart.
4562229 4563730 -Night, Mom.<br />-What is this?
4563814 4567442 Simulation terminated.<br />Simulation terminated.
4567901 4570612 Well, I don't know<br />about the rest of you guys,
4570696 4573115 but I spotted several big mistakes.
4573198 4575158 But how did...
4575242 4578620 You know what? Let's watch<br />my favorite part again. Shall we?
4578704 4581957 I'll kidnap 1,000 children<br />before I let this company die.
4582457 4585961 I'll kidnap 1,000 children<br />before I let this company die.
4586086 4589923 I'll kidnap 1,000 children<br />before I let this company die.
4590591 4591758 -Come with us.<br />-What are you doing?
4591842 4594136 Take your hands off.<br />You can't arrest me.
4594219 4597764 I hope you're happy, Sullivan.<br />You destroyed this company.
4597806 4602102 Monsters, Incorporated is dead!<br />Where will everyone get their scream?
4602352 4606440 The energy crisis will only get worse<br />because of you!
4611320 4613864 Stay where you are.<br />Number one wants to talk to you.
4614114 4615532 Attention.
4622539 4624124 Hello, boys.
4624458 4625626 -Roz?<br />-Roz?
4626835 4631507 Two and a half years of<br />undercover work were almost wasted
4631590 4634551 when you intercepted that child,<br />Mr. Sullivan.
4635385 4637262 Of course, without your help,
4637304 4641558 I never would have known that<br />this went all the way up to Waternoose.
4645521 4647940 Now, about the girl.
4648649 4650901 I just want to send her home.
4651777 4653153 Very good.
4653820 4656782 -Bring me a door shredder.<br />-What? You mean...
4656823 4659117 You mean I can't see her again?
4659535 4661745 That's the way it has to be.
4663247 4665040 I'll give you five minutes.
4676802 4679304 -Well, so long, kid.<br />-Mike Wazowski.
4680013 4681139 Yeah.
4681682 4682850 Boo.
4682891 4684268 It's been fun.
4687020 4689189 Go ahead. Go grow up.
4709334 4710836 But, Boo...
4711837 4712963 Boo.
4713755 4715883 Look at that. You know...
4716925 4718677 That's cute. Yeah.
4720053 4721263 Boo...
4722806 4724725 Well, that's very nice.
4726059 4727644 Come here, you!
4735611 4737946 Oh, he's a happy bear
4744036 4747331 Nothing's coming out of your closet<br />to scare you anymore, right?
4748081 4749374 Yeah.
4751418 4752920 Goodbye, Boo.
4754046 4755172 Kitty.
4756507 4758217 Kitty has to go.
4798841 4800050 Boo.
4803095 4804304 Kitty?
4813522 4816608 None of this ever happened,<br />gentlemen.
4817818 4821613 And I don't want to see<br />any paperwork on this.
4843677 4845179 Take him away.
4848182 4850392 I bet we get the rest of the day off.
4850475 4853604 You idiot.<br />They're gonna shut down the factory.
4856565 4859193 When that wall went up, you should<br />have seen Waternoose's face.
4859776 4861778 I hope we get a copy of that tape.
4862029 4863238 Are you all right?
4863697 4865532 Come on, pal.<br />Cheer up. We did it!
4865574 4867075 We got Boo home.
4867159 4869786 Sure, we put the factory<br />in the toilet and
4869870 4872039 hundreds of people<br />will be out of work.
4872080 4875000 Not to mention the mob that will<br />come after us when there's no power,
4875042 4877794 but at least we had some laughs, right?
4881757 4883050 Laughs.
4903529 4906156 Is this thing on?<br />Hello? Hello? Testing.
4906573 4908951 Good evening. Nice to see you.
4909034 4911537 It's great to be here in your room.
4911578 4913372 Where are you from?
4914623 4917417 You're in kindergarten, right?<br />I love kindergarten.
4917501 4919461 Best three years of my life.
4920337 4923257 Of my life.<br />But I love sports.
4923423 4926760 Dodgeball was the best.<br />I was the fastest one out there.
4926802 4928762 Of course, I was the ball.
4928846 4931473 I was the ball, see...
4932057 4933559 All right.
4948156 4950409 Thanks a lot.<br />I'll be here all week.
4950450 4952786 Remember to tip your waitresses.
4956623 4959835 Great job, Mikey. You filled your quota<br />on the first kid of the day.
4959918 4963005 Not bad. Only somebody<br />with perfect comedic timing
4963088 4965799 could produce this much energy<br />in one shot.
4965966 4968802 And the fact that laughter<br />is ten times more powerful than scream
4968886 4970470 had nothing to do with it?
4972139 4974474 Googly bear, come here, you.
4974516 4976852 -Schmoopsie-pooh!<br />-Googly.
4979521 4982941 Girls, stop, stop, stop.
4983525 4985277 Michael, you're such a charmer.
4985861 4988405 -Did you bring the magazine?<br />-A whole box.
4988488 4990157 Let me see it!
4990407 4992326 Sulley and I made the cover, right?
4993827 4995662 I don't believe it!
4996038 4997706 Googly bear.
4997831 5001376 I'm on the cover of a magazine!
5007508 5009384 This is great.
5037037 5039039 -Hey, Sulley.<br />-Hey, Mike.
5039122 5041792 -I was...<br />-There's something I want to show you.
5041875 5043836 Close your eyes. Follow me.
5043877 5046338 Come on. No peeking.
5047631 5049633 Keep coming, keep coming.
5049716 5050717 -Come on.<br />-Mike!
5050801 5053387 Follow the sultry sound of my voice.
5053470 5054638 OK, stop.
5054721 5056014 Open 'em.
5059393 5062229 Mike, is that...
5062396 5064273 Sorry it took so long, pal.
5064356 5066942 There was a lot of wood to go through.
5067234 5069945 It only works if you have every piece.
5097890 5099057 Boo?
5099975 5101268 Kitty!
