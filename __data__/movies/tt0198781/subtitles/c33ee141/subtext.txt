1686352 1688062 I don't need to know<br />any of that stuff to scare.
1688772 1691191 That "stuff" would've informed you
1691274 1693943 that this particular child<br />is afraid of snakes.
1694486 1697405 So a roar wouldn't make him scream,<br />it would make him cry,

1924882 1925800 (SCOFFS)
1926843 1928636 And what would that prove?

1934350 1935518 Very well.

1942692 1944944 But if you lose,

2015014 2017433 All right, Wazowski, what's the plan?
2022647 2024565 This is a fraternity house?
2024649 2028402 Hey there, teammateys!<br />Come on aboard!
2029320 2031405 As the president of Oozma Kappa,
2031489 2034200 it is my honor to welcome you<br />to your new home.
2035701 2037787 We call this room "Party Central."
2038079 2040206 Technically, we haven't<br />actually had a party here yet.
2040289 2042625 But when we do, we'll be ready!
2048798 2049882 Whoo!
2049966 2053386 The hot cocoa train<br />is coming through! Whoa!
2053469 2055304 - Next stop... You!<br />- (CUPS RATTLING)
2055388 2057431 I would like to start us off first by...
2057807 2059850 So, you guys are Scaring majors?
2060268 2063229 (CHUCKLES) We were!<br />None of us lasted very long.
2063312 2066732 I guess we just weren't what<br />old Hardscrabble was looking for.
2066816 2068818 Don Carlton, mature student.
2069735 2071988 Thirty years in the textile industry
2072154 2074156 and then old dandy Don got downsized.
2074240 2076158 Figured I could throw myself a pity party,
2076242 2078327 or go back to school<br />and learn the computers.
2079245 2080287 Hello. I'm Terry with a "Y"...
2080371 2083332 And I'm Terri with an "I"!<br />I'm a dance major!
2083416 2084583 (CHUCKLES) And I'm not.
2084667 2086585 Five, six, seven, eight! (SCATTING)
2086669 2089088 Seven, eight, turn! And...<br />Why didn't you turn?
2089171 2090923 Because we never agreed to do this!
2091215 2093676 - You said this was going to be cool!<br />- No one said this was gonna be cool.
2093759 2095011 - Now I'm embarrassed.<br />- Now you're embarrassed?
2095094 2096429 Yes, because it's in front of people!
2096512 2097930 You should wake up embarrassed.
2098014 2099181 Hey, hey, hey!
2099598 2102435 I'm Art! New Age philosophy major.
2102518 2104770 Excited to live with you<br />and laugh with you,
2105771 2107106 and cry with you.
2108774 2110943 Thought you might like<br />to keep a dream journal.
2113195 2114447 - Guess that leaves me.<br />- Ah!
2114530 2115948 My name's Scott Squibbles.
2116032 2117616 My friends call me Squishy.
2117700 2119827 I'm undeclared, unattached,
2119910 2123581 and unwelcome pretty much<br />everywhere but here.
2124040 2126292 Now that we've all been introduced,<br />as captain of our team...
2126375 2129003 So, basically, you guys have<br />no Scaring experience?
2129378 2132048 (CHUCKLES) Not a lot!<br />But now we've got you!
2132256 2134633 You're about the scariest fella<br />I've ever seen.
2134717 2136302 Even with them pink polka dots.
2136385 2137428 Aw, thanks.
2138054 2139764 Actually, I think I bring<br />the whole package.
2140014 2141348 Your hands are as big as my face!
2141682 2142892 He's like a mountain with fur!
2143350 2145311 Oh, come on. I don't even work out.
2145561 2148856 Yeah, me neither.<br />I don't want to get too big. (SNIFFS)
2149648 2152651 We thought our dreams were over,<br />but Mike said if we win,
2152735 2154236 they're letting us in the Scaring program.
2154487 2156363 We're going to be real Scarers!
2156614 2158324 - The best!<br />- You betcha! (CHUCKLES)
2158407 2160034 Yeah! (CHUCKLES) Right.
2162369 2164830 And here's what you've been<br />waiting for, fellas.
2164914 2167083 Your very own Oozma Kappa bedroom.
2168084 2171337 Oh... Great! We're sharing this room?
2171420 2173172 We'll let you guys get settled.
2173255 2175674 Anything you need,<br />you just give a big holler-oonie!
2175758 2178636 Okay, thanks, buddy.<br />Are you kidding me?
2178928 2181263 Look, they don't need to be good.<br />I'm going to carry the whole team.
2181597 2183724 Really? And who's going to carry you?
2184100 2185518 Hey, if you want to go back<br />to can design,
2185601 2186894 you know where the door is.

2774773 2777484 (SCOFFS) We can't just<br />"get a new team"!
2777567 2779027 I checked this morning.<br />It's against the rules.
2779486 2781279 What if we disguised a new team<br />to look like the old team?
2781613 2783198 Oh, no, no. We are not cheating.
2783531 2785700 It's not cheating. I'm just, you know,

5343588 5344589 That's worse.
5346591 5348260 Well, I guess we should be going now.
5350053 5352264 Promise me you'll keep in touch.
5357519 5360063 You're the scariest bunch<br />of monsters I have ever met.
5363692 5365944 Don't let anyone tell you different.
5379749 5381334 (ALL CHUCKLING)
5392053 5395015 So, what now?
5396475 5399102 You know, for the first time in my life,<br />I don't really have a plan.
5399811 5403148 You're the great Mike Wazowski.<br />You'll come up with something.
5404483 5407319 I think it's time I leave the greatness<br />to other monsters.
5408320 5410363 I'm okay just being okay.
5419498 5420665 So long, Sull.
5422125 5423168 So long.
5450362 5451488 - Wazowski!<br />- (SCREAMS)
5451613 5452989 - Whoa!<br />- Stop the bus!
5453365 5454366 (BRAKES SCREECHING)
5455200 5456326 Are you crazy?
5456952 5458453 (PANTING) Mike,
5458662 5460872 I don't know a single Scarer<br />who can do what you do.
5461331 5463208 I know, everyone sees us together,
5463375 5465794 they think I'm the one running the show,<br />but the truth is,
5465877 5468713 I've been riding your coattails<br />since day one!
5469172 5470799 You made the deal with Hardscrabble.
5471049 5473510 You took a hopeless team<br />and made them champions.
5473593 5475053 All I did was catch a pig!
5475470 5476721 Technically, I caught the pig.
5477138 5480016 Exactly! And you think you're just okay?
5480100 5482561 You pulled off the biggest Scare<br />this school has ever seen!
5482852 5484729 - That wasn't me!<br />- That was you!
5484854 5486940 You think I could have done that<br />without you?
5487023 5489401 I didn't even bring a pencil<br />on the first day of school.
5491736 5494406 Mike, you're not scary. Not even a little.
5494489 5495907 But you are fearless.
5498076 5500620 And if Hardscrabble can't see that,<br />then she can just...
5500704 5502789 I can just what?
5504583 5507919 Careful, Mr. Sullivan.<br />I was just warming up to you.
5508837 5509838 Sorry.
5510255 5511756 Well, gentlemen,
5513133 5516094 it seems you made the front page again.
5518722 5520140 The two of you did something together
5520599 5522601 that no one has ever done before.
5523810 5525145 You surprised me.
5526646 5530233 Perhaps I should keep an eye out<br />for more surprises
5530317 5531818 like you in my program.
5532777 5535739 But as far as the two of you<br />are concerned
5535822 5537824 there is nothing I can do for you now.
5539117 5541911 Except, perhaps, wish you luck.
5545957 5549794 And, Mr. Wazowski,<br />keep surprising people.
5560138 5563683 You know, there is still one way<br />we can work at a Scare company.
5567354 5569397 They're always hiring in the mailroom.
5573777 5575570 This is better than I ever imagined!
5575653 5578365 I bet we break the all-time record<br />in our first year.
5578448 5579866 Mike, we're mail guys.
5579949 5583119 I know. I'm talking about<br />the record for letters delivered!
5583203 5584287 (GASPS)
5584704 5587082 All right, newbies, quit goofing around.
5587165 5589751 I'll have you know tampering<br />with the mail is a crime
5589834 5591753 - punishable by banishment!<br />- Yes, sir.
5591836 5593421 We're right on it, Mr. Snowman.
5593505 5595006 The team of Wazowski and Sullivan
5595090 5597175 are going to change the world<br />starting today!
5597258 5598259 Say scream!
5598343 5599386 - Scream!<br />- Scream!
5599969 5601554 (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
5643805 5645265 Wazowski, good luck on your first day!
5645348 5646433 Thanks, Merv.
5646516 5648518 - Good luck, Mike!<br />- Thanks, fellas.
5651396 5653440 (ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)
5655233 5656568 You coming, Coach?
5657986 5659404 You better believe it.
