1233251 1234809 sometimes I think<br />I should just marry myself.

1540771 1542602 about the first time<br />I laid eye on you--
1542691 1543646 how pretty you looked.
1543731 1544766 Stop it!
1544851 1546000 Your hair was<br />shorter then.
1546091 1547490 Mm-hmm. I'm thinking<br />about getting it cut.
1547571 1548447 ( faint squeal of fear )
1548531 1549600 No, no, I like<br />it this length.
1549691 1550567 ( sighs of relief )
1550651 1552050 I like everything<br />about you.
1552131 1553041 Just the other day
1553131 1554450 someone asked me<br />who I thought
1554531 1556328 the most beautiful monster was<br />in all of Monstropolis.
1556411 1557287 You know what I said?
1557371 1558645 What did you say?
1558731 1559607 I said...
1559691 1560726 Sulley?
1560811 1562039 Sulley?
1562131 1563086 No! No, no.
1563171 1564399 That's not<br />what I was going to say.
1564491 1565844 Mike, you're not making sense.
1565931 1567523 SULLEY:<br />Hi, guys!
1567611 1568930 What a coincidence,<br />running into you here!
1569011 1570444 Uh, I'm just going<br />to order something to go.
1570531 1571407 Michael...
1571491 1572367 Sulley!
1572451 1573486 I wonder what's good here.
1573571 1574924 Get out of here.<br />You're ruining everything.
1575011 1576046 I went back to get<br />your paperwork
1576131 1577007 and there was a door.
1577091 1578046 What?
1579411 1580924 ( rattling )
1581011 1581887 A door?!
1581971 1582847 Randall was in it.
1582931 1583841 Wait a minute.<br />Randall?
1583931 1584841 That cheater!
1584931 1586603 He's trying<br />to boost his numbers!
1586691 1587919 There's something else.
1588011 1588887 What?!
1588971 1590086 Ook-lay in the ag-bay.
1590171 1591047 What?!
1591131 1592200 Look in the bag.
1592291 1593929 What bag?
1594011 1596127 ( sighs )
1597171 1598889 ( gasps )
1598971 1600563 ( giggling )
1600651 1601766 Oh!
1601851 1602920 They don't have<br />anything I like here.
1603011 1603966 So take care, Celia!
1604051 1604881 Excuse me, sir.
1604971 1605847 What's going on?
1605931 1607364 Celia, please try<br />to understand.
1608611 1610124 I have to do something!
1610211 1611087 Michael?
1611171 1612650 PHOTOGRAPHER:<br />On three.
1612731 1613846 One... two....
1613931 1614807 ( squeals and giggles )
1614891 1617041 ( screaoing )
1617131 1617529 A kid!
1617611 1618726 Boo!
1618811 1620483 ( all screaoing )
1623051 1624279 A kid!
1626291 1628009 There's a kid here--<br />a human kid!
1628091 1629604 ( exclaioing in baby talk )
1629691 1631488 Oh!
1631571 1632924 CELIA:<br />Googley Bear!
1634171 1636321 ( yelling )
1638011 1639330 ( blows raspberry )
1639411 1640526 Come on!
1642531 1644647 ( oonsters screaoing in terror )
1644731 1645846 MIKE:<br />Let's get out of here!
1645931 1648126 CD A HELICOPTER PILOT:<br />Please remain calm.
1648211 1649246 This is not a drill.
1649331 1651049 ( siren wailing,<br />~ tyres screeching )
1651131 1653008 CD A AGENT:<br />We have an 835 in progress.
1653091 1653921 Please advise.
1654011 1656206 Michael? Michael?
1656291 1657280 Oh, Celia.
1657371 1658850 -Please come with me.<br />-Ow. Stop pushing.
1658931 1660728 Hey, get your hands off<br />my Schmoopsie-poo!
1660811 1663006 Building clear.<br />Ready for decontamination.
1663091 1665924 Well, I don't think that date<br />could have gone any worse.
1666011 1666966 ( explosion )
1667051 1668689 ( electrical buzzing )
1672491 1674243 If witnesses are to be believed
1674331 1676367 there has been<br />a child security breach
1676451 1678601 for the first time<br />in monster history.
1678691 1680010 We can neither confirm nor deny
1680091 1682082 the presence of<br />a human child here tonight.
1682171 1683809 Well, a kid flew right over me
1683891 1686041 and blasted a car<br />with its laser vision!
1686131 1688281 I tried to run from it,<br />but it picked me up
1688371 1690760 with its mind powers<br />and shook me like a doll!
1690851 1692648 It's true!<br />I saw the whole thing!
1692731 1695199 It is my<br />professional opinion
1695291 1698089 that now is the time<br />to... panic!
1698171 1699365 Oh-oh.
1699451 1701442 ( both yelling )
1701531 1702646 Oh, it's coming!
1702731 1703880 It's coming!
1703971 1705723 ( giggling ):<br />Boo!
1705811 1706926 ( both screaoing )
1707011 1708842 ( distant sirens wailing )
1709891 1711404 ( delighted cry )
1711491 1713129 ( yelling )
1713211 1714610 No, no, no, no, no!
1714691 1715806 Come here, kid.
1715891 1716846 Whee.
1718971 1720370 No, don't touch those,<br />you little...!
1720451 1721327 Oh, now
1721411 1722446 those were alphabetized.
1722531 1723520 It's okay, it's all right.
1723611 1724805 As long as it doesn't<br />come near us
1724891 1725767 we're going to be okay.
1725851 1726727 ( sneezes )
1726811 1727960 ( screaos )
1728691 1729919 ( yelling in pain )
1730011 1731239 ( whiopering in fear )
1731331 1732446 Wanna ride on it!
1733931 1734568 Da, da-da.
1734651 1735527 Da-da-da.
1735611 1736646 Oh, y-you like this?
1736731 1737561 Fetch!
1737651 1738527 ( giggles )
1738611 1740090 ( gasps )
1740171 1741490 Hey, hey, that's it!
1741571 1743402 No one touches<br />little Mikey!
1743491 1745209 ( whining )
1745291 1747168 Mike, give her the bear.
1748811 1749687 Oh, no.
1749771 1751523 ( piercing screao )
1751611 1752964 ( electrical buzzing )
1754611 1757364 ( screaoing and crying<br />~ continue )
1757451 1760329 ( buzzing continues )
1762611 1763521 ( exclaioing in fear )
1763611 1764805 Make it stop, Sulley!
1764891 1765960 Make it stop!
1766051 1767200 Look!<br />See the bear?
1767291 1768280 Ooh, nice bear.
1768371 1769406 ( screaos )
1769491 1770526 Sulley!
1770611 1771600 See?
1771691 1772680 Ooh, bear, ooh.
1772771 1774443 Oh, he's<br />a happy bear.
1774531 1776044 He's not crying,<br />neither should you
1776131 1777405 Or we'll be in trouble
1777491 1778480 'Cause they're gonna find us
1778571 1780562 So please stop crying
1780651 1781686 Right now.
1781771 1782760 Good, good, Sulley.<br />Keep it up.
1782851 1784045 You're doing great.
1784131 1785280 Ooh, the happy bear,<br />he has no...
1785371 1786520 ( screaoing )
1786611 1787839 She touched me!
1787931 1788841 Sulley, the bear!
1788931 1789807 The bear!
1789891 1790801 Give her the...
1790891 1792370 Whoa!
1794811 1796164 ( giggles )
1796251 1797479 ( screaoing with laughter )
1797571 1799323 ( electrical buzzing<br />~ grows louder )
1799411 1800366 ( light bulb shatters )
1800451 1801361 ( giggles )
1801451 1803009 What was that?
1803091 1804001 ( thuoping )
1804091 1804967 I have no idea
1805051 1806769 but it would be<br />really great
1806851 1808284 if it didn't<br />do it again.
1808371 1809486 ( giggles )
1809571 1810845 Shh, shh, shh.
1810931 1812000 Shh...
1812091 1813206 Shh.
1813291 1814883 Shh...
1823491 1824719 Ah!
1828091 1829160 How could I do this?
1829251 1830684 How could I be so stupid?
1830771 1832250 This could destroy<br />the company.
1832331 1833207 The company?
1833291 1834610 Who cares<br />about the company?!
1834691 1835567 What about us?
1835651 1837084 That thing is<br />a killing machine!
1837171 1839207 La-la-la-la-la-la
1839291 1841088 I bet it's just waiting<br />for us to fall asleep
1841171 1842206 and then wham!
1842291 1843963 Oh, we're easy prey,<br />my friend-- easy prey.
1844051 1845848 We're sitting targets.
1845931 1846761 Okay, look, I think
1846851 1848125 I have a plan here.
1848211 1851283 Using mainly spoons, we dig<br />a tunnel under the city
1851371 1853168 and release it into the wild.
1853251 1855242 Spoons.
1855331 1856684 That's it, I'm out of ideas.
1856771 1858124 We're closed.<br />Hot air balloon?
1858211 1859803 Too expensive.<br />Giant slingshot?
1859891 1860767 Too conspicuous.
1860851 1861886 Enormous wooden horse?<br />Too Greek!
1861971 1865043 ( speaking baby talk )
1865131 1867087 No plan. No plan.
1867171 1869401 Can't think.<br />Can't think.
1869491 1870446 Flatlining.
1870531 1871407 Uh, Mike?
1871491 1873607 I think she's getting tired.
1873691 1875443 Well, then<br />why don't you
1875531 1877920 find someplace<br />for it to sleep?
1878011 1879524 While I think of a plan!
1881051 1882643 Are you sleepy?
1882731 1884642 You want to sleep?
1884731 1885720 Is that what you want?
1885811 1887130 Huh?
1895051 1898930 ( crunching )
1899011 1900046 Okay, all right.
1900131 1901644 I'm making a nice<br />little area for you to...
1901731 1902766 ( giggling )
1902851 1904569 No. Hey, hey,<br />that's my bed!
1904651 1906004 You're going to get<br />your germs all over it.
1908131 1909086 ( sighing ):<br />Fine.
1909171 1911446 My chair is<br />more comfortable anyway.
1911531 1912759 ( yells )
1912851 1913727 What?
1913811 1914960 ( speaking fearfully )
1916651 1917527 It's just a closet.
1917611 1918680 Will you go to sleep?
1922331 1924083 Hey, that looks like Randall.
1924171 1926446 Randall's your monster.
1926531 1929443 You think he's going<br />to come through the closet
1929531 1930407 and scare you.
1930491 1932402 Oh, boy,<br />how do I explain this?
1932491 1933401 Uh, it's empty.
1933491 1934765 -See?<br />-Ah!
1934851 1936523 No monster in here.
1939971 1941370 Well, now there is
1941451 1943965 but I'm not going to scare you.
1944051 1945120 I'm off-duty.
1948931 1950159 Okay.
1950251 1954529 How about I sit here,<br />until you fall asleep?
1956531 1957646 Go ahead.
1957731 1959050 Go to sleep.
1959131 1960007 Now.
1960091 1962889 Now... go.
1962971 1964165 Uh, you...
1964251 1965400 go...
1965491 1966480 to...
1966571 1967560 sleep.
1967651 1969130 ( ioitating snoring )
1969211 1970564 ( giggles )
1973931 1975649 ( sighs in relief )
1991891 1994246 ( door creaks softly )
1999811 2001324 Hey, Mike,<br />this might sound crazy
2001411 2003447 but I don't think<br />that kid's dangerous.
2003531 2005601 Really? Well, in that case,<br />let's keep it.
2005691 2007568 I always wanted a pet<br />that could kill me!
2007651 2008800 Now, look.
2008891 2010563 What if we just put<br />her back in her door?
2010651 2012004 What?
2012091 2013001 Mike, think about it.
2013091 2014524 If we send her back,<br />it's like it never happened.
2014611 2015600 Everything goes back to normal.
2015691 2016567 Is that a joke?
2016651 2017686 Tell me you're joking.
2019291 2021566 Sulley, I'd like to think<br />that, given the circumstances
2021651 2023289 I have been extremely<br />forgiving up to now
2023371 2024520 but that is a horrible idea!
2024611 2025805 What are we going to do?
2025891 2027643 March right out into<br />public with that thing?
2027731 2030120 Then I guess we just waltz<br />right up to the factory, right?
2030295 2033287 I can't believe we<br />are waltzing right<br />up to the factory.
2033375 2036333 Sulley, a mop,<br />a couple of lights<br />and some chair fabric
2036415 2037973 are not going<br />to fool anyone!
2038055 2040171 Just think about<br />a few names, will you?
2040255 2042371 Loch Ness, Bigfoot,<br />the Abominable Snowman--
2042455 2044969 they all got one thing<br />in common, pal-- banishment.
2045055 2046329 We could be next!
2046415 2047530 Don't panic--<br />we can do this.
2047615 2048650 Hey, how you doing, Frank?
2048735 2049645 Hey, guys.
2049735 2050770 Everything's going
2050855 2052004 to be okay.
2052095 2053005 ( gasping )
2053095 2055006 ( equipoent buzzing loudly )
2056775 2058367 Number One wants this place<br />dusted for prints.
2058455 2059604 Careful with that.
2059695 2061014 I got a good view from here.
2061095 2062653 A little lower.
2062735 2065249 This was recovered<br />at the scene.
2065335 2066211 Don't panic.<br />Don't panic!
2066295 2067205 Don't tell me<br />not to panic.
2067295 2068205 Just keep it together.
2068295 2069171 Everything is not okay!
2069255 2070131 LITTLE GIRL:<br />Boo.
2070215 2071648 ...could be contaminated.
2071735 2072770 Gentlemen, safety
2072855 2073970 is our number one concern.
2074055 2075329 If there's anything that...
2075415 2076325 Not now, not now.
2076415 2077894 Oh, hello, little one.
2077975 2079613 Where did you come from?
2079695 2080650 Mr Waternoose!
2080735 2082373 Ah,James!<br />Is this one yours?
2082455 2085925 Actually, that's my, uh,<br />cousin's sister's daughter, sir.
2086015 2087687 Yeah, it's, uh...
2087775 2090448 ''Bring an Obscure Relative<br />to Work Day.''
2090535 2091968 Hmm, must have<br />missed the memo.
2092055 2093090 Well, listen,James
2093175 2095564 why don't you stop by<br />the simulator after lunch today
2095655 2097247 and give us<br />that scare demonstration
2097335 2098450 we talked about, huh?
2098535 2100014 Oh, oh, sir, uh....
2100095 2101323 Excuse me,<br />Mr Waternoose?
2101415 2102530 Yes, yes, I'm coming.
2102615 2104765 All right then, I'll see<br />you this afternoon,James.
2104855 2106971 That is, if these gentlemen<br />haven't shut us down.
2107055 2108010 Oh, boy.
2108095 2109005 Oh, a scare demo.
2109095 2110050 Well, that is great.
2110135 2111124 Why am I<br />the last to know?
2111215 2113251 We can bring your cousin's<br />sister's daughter along.
2113335 2114245 She'll be a big hit!
2114335 2115450 ( equipoent buzzing loudly )
2115535 2116570 Halt!
2116655 2117565 ( yelling )
2117655 2118610 Stop him!
2118695 2120287 Hold him down.
2123855 2124970 Come on,<br />the coast is clear.
2125055 2127489 Okay, all we have to do<br />is get rid of that thing.
2127575 2129566 So, wait here while<br />I get its card key.
2129655 2130804 But she can't stay here.
2130895 2132044 This is the men's room.
2132135 2134774 That is the weirdest thing<br />you have ever said.
2134855 2136049 It's fine. It's okay.
2136135 2137170 Look, it loves it here!
2137255 2138244 It's dancing with joy!
2138335 2139563 Uh, uh, uh, uh.
2139655 2141611 I'll be right back<br />with its door key.
2141695 2142810 ( laughs )
2142895 2145363 That's a cute little<br />dance you've got.
2145455 2147047 It almost looks<br />like you've got to...
2147135 2148727 ( whining )
2148815 2150646 Oh.
2150735 2153613 ( singing in baby talk )
2158295 2160126 ( singing stops )
2160215 2163764 Uh, are you<br />done in there?
2163855 2165004 ( squeals )
2165095 2167450 Ah! Sorry. Sorry.
2167535 2170174 ( singing )
2176135 2178774 ( toilet flushes )
2178855 2180925 Okay, you<br />finished now, right?
2181015 2182209 Hello?
2183615 2184491 ( yells )
2186695 2187889 Boo.
2187975 2189203 ( giggles )
2189295 2191445 ( sighs )
2191535 2193048 ( giggling )
2195135 2196887 ( chuckles )
2196975 2199648 Where did she go?
2199735 2201965 Oh, did she disappear?
2202055 2204410 Did she turn invisible?
2204495 2206087 ( giggling softly )
2206175 2207654 I just have no idea.
2209015 2210448 Gotcha!
2210535 2213049 Boo.
2213135 2214284 ( giggles )
2214375 2216206 Hey, you're good.
2217695 2219014 ( sighs )
2221735 2225045 Be relaxed,<br />be relaxed, be relaxed.
2225135 2226568 Roz, my tender,<br />oozing blossom
2226655 2228134 you're looking<br />fabulous today.
2228215 2229364 Is that a new haircut?
2229455 2230365 Come on, tell me.
2230455 2231774 It's a new haircut,<br />isn't it?
2231855 2232731 That's got to be<br />a new haircut.
2232815 2233725 New make-up?<br />You've had a lift.
2233815 2235134 You've had a tuck.<br />You've had something.
2235215 2236933 Something has been<br />inserted in your skin
2237015 2238209 that makes you look like...
2238295 2239808 ( sighs )
2239895 2241089 Listen, I need a favour.
2241175 2243006 Randall was working<br />late last night
2243095 2244369 out on the scare floor.
2244455 2247049 I really need the key<br />for the door he was using.
2247135 2248648 Well, isn't that nice?
2248735 2250930 But guess what?
2251015 2254212 You didn't turn in<br />your paperwork last night.
2254295 2256092 He didn't... I...<br />no paperwork?
2256175 2258131 This office is now closed.
2259135 2260693 ( Mike screaos in pain )
2260775 2263050 Ready or not, here I come!
2263135 2264887 I'm getting warmer.
2264975 2266124 Any second now.
2266215 2269207 Fee fi fo...
2269295 2270330 What are you doing?!
2270415 2272087 I-I'm looking<br />for the kid.
2272175 2273290 You lost it?!
2273375 2274524 No, no, she was just....
2274615 2276287 ( squeals )
2276375 2277444 Here she is.
2277535 2278490 ( whining )
2278575 2279849 Hey, what's the matter?
2279935 2282495 RAND ALL:<br />I already told your buddies<br />I haven't seen anything.
2282575 2283974 CD A AGENT:<br />All right. Carry on.
2291895 2292964 ( splashing )
2293775 2294969 Randall!<br />Thank goodness!
2295055 2297285 What are we going to do<br />about the child?
2297375 2298524 Shh!
2299695 2301606 Shh, shh, shh.
2306495 2308292 ( door slaos open )
2312135 2313170 ( door slaos open )
2317895 2319806 The front page!<br />It's on the front page.
2319895 2321567 The child--<br />the one you were after.
2321655 2322690 Will you be quiet?!
2322775 2324811 Don't you think I'm aware<br />of the situation?
2324895 2326613 I was up all night<br />trying to find it.
2326695 2328014 I did a simple<br />calculation
2328095 2330484 factoring in the size<br />of the sushi restaurant.
2330575 2331974 The child<br />may have escaped!
2332055 2333568 Yeah, well, until<br />we know for sure
2333655 2335725 we're going to act like<br />nothing happened, understand?
2335815 2337453 You just get the<br />machine up and running.
2337535 2338604 I'll take care of the kid.
2338695 2340811 And when I find whoever<br />let it out, they're dead!
2340895 2342248 Oh!
2343695 2344889 Why are you still here?
2344975 2346124 Come on, go!
2346215 2347284 Move! Now!
2347375 2348649 FUNGUS:<br />Ow, ow! I'm not here.
2348735 2350771 SULLEY ( whispering ):<br />They're gone.
2350855 2352288 ( squeaking and splashing )
2352375 2354047 LITTLE GIRL:<br />Ew.
2354135 2355250 MIKE:<br />This is bad.
2355335 2356688 This is so very bad.
2356775 2358254 What were they talking<br />about a machine?
2358335 2359324 Who cares? Oh!
2359415 2360814 Look, don't panic--<br />all we have to do
2360895 2362453 is call her door down<br />and send her home.
2362535 2363604 You're right.<br />You're right.
2363695 2365811 We're just two regular joes<br />on our way to work.
2365895 2367248 We will blend right in.
2367335 2368563 Top of the mornin', fellas!
2368655 2369929 Hey, what's shakin',<br />bacon?
2370015 2371050 Did you lose weight?
2371135 2372250 Or a limb?
2372335 2373529 You have<br />her card key, right?
2373615 2374809 Of course<br />I have her card key.
2374895 2376248 I told you<br />I'd get her card key.
2376335 2377404 I went and got<br />her card key
2377495 2379406 and now I have her card key.
2380495 2382531 Okay, here we go.
2382615 2383684 Take care of yourself.
2383775 2385731 Try not to run<br />through any more closets.
2385815 2387248 ( giggles )
2387335 2389690 Mike,<br />that's not her door.
2389775 2391333 What are you<br />talking about?
2391415 2392928 Of course it's her door.<br />It's her door.
2393015 2394971 No, her door was white<br />and it had flowers on it.
2395055 2396773 No. It must have been<br />dark last night
2396855 2397970 because this is its door.
2398055 2399124 ( polka ousic playing )
2399215 2400170 Hey, you hear that?
2400255 2402132 Sounds like fun in there!
2402215 2403534 Okay, send me a postcard, kid.

2410375 2411728 Bye-bye!<br />Come on.
2411815 2413328 Look at the stick.<br />See the stick?
2413415 2414564 Go get the stick!<br />Go fetch.
2414655 2416532 Mike, this isn't<br />Boo's door.
2416615 2417889 Boo? What's Boo?
2417975 2420205 That's what I decided<br />to call her.
2420295 2421694 Is there a problem?
2421775 2423413 Sulley, you're not<br />supposed to name it.
2423495 2425690 Once you name it,<br />you start getting attached to it!
2425775 2426764 Now put that thing
2426855 2429653 back where it came from,<br />or so help me...
2433135 2434170 Oh, hey!
2434255 2436815 We're rehearsing a scene<br />for the upcoming company play
2436895 2439125 ~called Put That Thing<br />Back Where It Caoe Froo

2441495 2442484 It's a musical!
2442575 2444566 Put that thing back where<br />it came from or so help me
2444655 2445770 Bom-bom, bom-bom,<br />bom-bom...

2446815 2447964 And cut!
2448055 2449124 We're still working on it.
2449215 2450091 It's a work in progress
2450175 2451688 but, hey,<br />we need ushers.
2451775 2452810 Sulley, I've had enough.
2452895 2454487 Now say goodbye to...<br />where'd it go?
2454575 2455530 What'd you do with it?
2455615 2456525 ( gasps ):<br />Where is she?
2456615 2457570 I don't believe it.
2457655 2458883 She got away<br />from you again?!
2458975 2459771 Well, that is just...
2459855 2460810 Wait a minute.
2460895 2462374 The sun is coming up.
2462455 2463604 This is perfect!
2463695 2465413 She's gone!
2465495 2466769 Hey, hey, hey, hey.
2466855 2467731 Where are you going?
2467815 2469009 Sulley, please,<br />don't blow this.
2469095 2470926 Not when we're so close<br />to breaking the record.
2471015 2472243 Somebody else<br />will find the kid.
2472335 2473563 It'll be their problem,<br />not ours!
2473655 2474565 She's out of our hair!
2475535 2476934 What are you<br />two doing?
2477015 2479006 They're rehearsing a play.
2479095 2480574 She's out of our hair!
2480655 2481724 Can it, Wazowski!
2481815 2484648 So, what do you think<br />of that kid getting out, Sullivan?
2484735 2485804 Pretty crazy, huh?
2485895 2487647 Oh, yeah, crazy.
2487735 2488724 Word on the street is the kid's
2488815 2489884 been traced back<br />to this factory.
2489975 2491124 You haven't seen anything,<br />have you?
2491215 2492614 Uh, well, uh...
2492695 2493810 No, no way!
2493895 2496045 But if it was<br />an inside job
2496135 2497932 I'd put my money<br />on Waxford.
2498015 2499084 Waxford?
2499175 2500324 Yeah, the one<br />at station six.
2500415 2501848 You know, he's got<br />them shifty eyes.
2501935 2503129 Hey, Waxford!
2503215 2504330 Sulley!
2504415 2505973 CELIA:<br />Michael Wazowski!
2507655 2508690 ( whiopers )
2508775 2510811 Last night was one<br />of the worst nights
2510895 2512408 of my entire life,<br />bar none!
2512495 2513928 ( hissing )
2514815 2516009 I thought<br />you cared about me.
2516095 2517005 Honey, please.
2517095 2519290 Schmoopsie, I thought<br />you liked sushi.
2519375 2520808 CELIA:<br />Sushi? Sushi?!!
2520895 2523409 You think this is<br />about sushi?!
2528815 2529964 Wazowski!
2530055 2531568 Michael! Mike...
2531655 2532849 Men.
2532935 2533890 ( panting )
2533975 2535374 Breathe. Keep breathing.
2543615 2545128 Whew.
2545215 2546250 Yikes!
2546335 2548053 Where's the kid?
2548135 2549693 Kid? What kid?
2549775 2551174 It's here in<br />the factory, isn't it?
2551255 2552404 You're not<br />pinning this on me.
2552495 2553689 It never would<br />have gotten out
2553775 2555333 if you hadn't been<br />cheating last night!
2555415 2556564 Cheating?
2557775 2559333 Cheating. Right.
2559415 2563203 Okay, I think I know how<br />to make this all go away.
2563295 2567334 What happens when<br />the whistle blows<br />in five minutes?
2567415 2569849 Uh... I get a time-out?
2569935 2572529 Everyone goes to lunch!
2572615 2575766 Which means the scare floor<br />will be...?
2577015 2578130 Painted?
2578215 2581048 Empty! It'll be<br />empty, you idiot!
2581135 2582807 You see that clock?
2582895 2584965 When the big hand<br />is pointing up
2585055 2587171 and the little hand<br />is pointing up
2587255 2589530 the kid's door<br />will be in my station.
2589615 2591810 But when the big hand<br />points down
2591895 2594363 the door will be gone.
2594455 2597367 You have until then<br />to put the kid back.
2597455 2600049 Get the picture?
2600135 2602569 ( roaring playfully )
2609735 2610611 Boo!
2610695 2612128 ( giggles )
2612215 2613091 No.
2613175 2614210 Hey, you! Halt!
2614295 2615808 He's the one.
2615895 2617169 The one from<br />the commercial!
2617255 2618370 Affirmative.<br />That's him.
2618455 2619604 Can we get<br />an autograph?
2619695 2621128 Oh, oh, sure.<br />No problem.
2621215 2624093 You can make that out<br />to Bethany, my daughter.
2624175 2625369 Yes. Let's see....
2625455 2627127 ''From your scary friend
2627215 2628728 best wishes...''
2628815 2630726 So I said,<br />''If you talk to me
2630815 2632931 like that again,<br />we're through!''
2633015 2634004 What'd she say?
2634095 2635164 You know my mom.
2635255 2636893 She sent me to my room.
2636975 2638567 See you guys later.<br />Take it easy.
2638655 2639770 Bottoms up!
2642895 2643611 ( gasps in horror )

2734495 2735564 Oh, great news, pal.
2735655 2736883 I got us a way out of this mess
2736975 2738090 but we got to hurry.
2738175 2739210 Where is it?
2739295 2741251 ( whiopering )
2741335 2743132 Sull, that's<br />a cube of garbage.
2743215 2744443 ( squeaks )
2744535 2745729 Uh-oh.
2745815 2748568 I-I can still hear<br />her little voice.
2748655 2750008 BOO:<br />Mike Wazowski!
2750095 2751369 Hey, I can hear her, too.

2761735 2763566 I was so worried!
2763655 2767933 Don't you ever run away<br />from me again, young lady!
2768015 2770893 Oh, but I'm so glad<br />you're safe.
2770975 2773933 My, what an affectionate father.
2774015 2775926 Actually, she's<br />my cousin's sister's...
2776015 2776891 Okay, Sulley.
2776975 2777964 That's enough.<br />Let's go.
2778055 2778931 Mike Wazowski!
2779015 2779891 Yeah, yeah.
2779975 2781249 Step aside, kid.<br />We're in a...
2781335 2782085 ( screaos in pain )
2782175 2782971 ( screaos with laughter )
2783055 2783726 ( electrical buzzing )
2783815 2784725 ( light bulbs shattering )
2784815 2785884 ( gasping )
2785975 2788205 ( baby oonsters screaoing<br />~ and crying )
2788295 2790809 Will you stop<br />making Boo laugh?
2790895 2792487 I didn't, so come on!
2792575 2794964 ( screaoing and crying<br />~ continue )
2795055 2796010 I still don't understand.
2796095 2796971 You've got Boo's door?
2797055 2797885 I'll explain later.
2797975 2798851 Run.
2798935 2800254 Okay, let's move,<br />let's move, let's move.
2800335 2801370 Come on.
2801455 2803252 Oh, please be there, please<br />be there, please be there.
2803335 2804768 There it is!
2804855 2805731 Just like Randall said!
2805815 2806725 Randall?<br />Wait a minute.
2806815 2807691 ( cries out in fear )
2807775 2808651 Oh, hey.
2808735 2809611 One, two, three, four!
2809695 2810684 Get the kid back<br />through the door!
2810775 2811651 Hey, hey.
2811735 2812804 We're going to get<br />our lives back.
2812895 2813771 The nightmare is over.
2813855 2814731 Hey, it's okay, Boo.
2814815 2815486 What's the matter?
2815575 2816803 Come on, it's time to move!
2816895 2817805 Mike, what are you thinking?
2817895 2818771 We can't trust Randall.
2818855 2819731 He's after Boo.
2819815 2820691 Who cares?<br />Let's go.
2820775 2821730 This is a limited time offer.
2821815 2822691 No, no.
2822775 2823651 I don't like this.
2823735 2826044 Look, Sulley, you wanted<br />her door and there it is.
2826135 2827011 Now, let's move.
2827095 2828608 No, Mike.
2828695 2830811 ( sighs ):<br />You want me to prove<br />everything's on the up-and-up?
2830895 2832328 Fine! He wants the door,<br />I get the door...
2832415 2833211 ( whispering ):<br />Mike, wait!
2833295 2834887 He's a paranoid<br />delusional furball.
2837455 2838251 Mike!
2842775 2844128 ( whiopers in fear )
2848535 2849729 ( whining )
2849815 2851487 Shh, shh, shh.
2866295 2867330 ( soall cry of surprise )
2884575 2887453 ( lunch bell rings )
2894735 2897966 Hey, Sulley,<br />where you been all day?
2898055 2899534 Sulley? Sulley?
2913455 2914365 Huh?
2914455 2915729 ( whispering ):<br />Mike?
2915815 2916691 Mike?
2916775 2919448 Where are you?
2919535 2921287 You in there?
2921375 2923127 Where are you, buddy?
2923215 2924170 Mike?
2924255 2925574 Hey.
2931695 2933094 ( door thunks )
2934695 2935889 ( excited baby talk )
2935975 2937533 Boo, way to go.
2937615 2938604 ( giggles )
2945215 2946409 It's okay.
2949975 2952284 ( door clunks shut )
2961535 2966086 ( pipes whistling and venting )
2969895 2972455 ( distant voices )
2975295 2977411 RAND ALL:<br />Yes! I got the kid!
2977495 2978848 FUNGUS:<br />Oh, huzzah!
2978935 2979811 That's great news.
2979895 2981647 Not that I was concerned,<br />of course.
2981735 2983214 Just get over<br />here and help me!
2983295 2984091 Come on, come<br />on, come on.
2984175 2985130 While we're young<br />here, Fungus!
2987375 2989650 ( both straining )
2989735 2991453 Kid needs to take<br />off a few pounds.
2995335 2996211 ( yelps )
2996295 2997205 Wazowski?!
2997295 2998694 Where is it,<br />you little one-eyed cretin?
2998775 2999764 Okay, first of all,<br />it's cree-tin.
2999855 3000731 If you're going<br />to threaten me
3000815 3001770 do it properly.
3001855 3003846 Second of all, you're nuts<br />if you think kidnapping me
3003935 3005653 is going to help you cheat<br />your way to the top!
3005735 3007009 ( chuckling evilly )
3007095 3011213 You still think this is about<br />that stupid scare record?
3011295 3014492 Well... I did, right up<br />until you chuckled like that
3014575 3017726 and now I'm thinking<br />I should just get out of here.
3017815 3021046 I am about to revolutionise<br />the scaring industry
3021135 3024252 and when I do, even<br />the great James P. Sullivan
3024335 3025814 is going to be<br />working for me.
3025895 3026771 MIKE:<br />Well
3026855 3029005 somebody's certainly<br />been a busy bee.
3029095 3030687 First, I need to know<br />where the kid is
3030775 3031924 and you're going<br />to tell me.
3032015 3033164 Yeah, I don't<br />know anything.
3033255 3034165 Uh-huh, sure.
3034255 3035131 MIKE:<br />I don't.
3035215 3036204 I mean, I don't.
3036295 3037614 Uh-oh.
3037695 3039014 ( oechanical clanging<br />~ and grinding )
3039095 3039971 What's that?
3040055 3041329 Come on.<br />Wait, wait, wait.
3041415 3042643 Oh-oh. Oh-oh.<br />Oh, come on.
3042735 3043611 No, no, no, no, no.
3043695 3044764 Come on,<br />hey, hey, hey.
3044855 3046493 This thing is moving.
3046575 3048486 I don't like big...
3048575 3050725 moving things that are<br />moving towards me.
3050815 3052089 No! Come on!
3052175 3053608 Hey, Randall!
3053695 3056732 Say hello<br />to the scream extractor.
3056815 3058692 Hello.
3058775 3059924 Come on,<br />where you going?
3060015 3060845 We'll talk.
3060935 3062004 Come on,<br />we'll have a latte!
3062095 3063084 Come on.
3063175 3064767 We can talk<br />about this.
3064855 3067574 ( electrical whirring starts,<br />~ then grows louder )
3067655 3070249 What's that thing?<br />What is that thing?
3070335 3071450 Wait, wait, wait!
3071535 3072570 Stop, stop!
3072655 3073883 No, no!
3073975 3074885 Come on, hey!
3074975 3076408 ( deep, resonating whirring )
3076495 3078087 Help! Help! Help!
3078175 3079085 Help!
3079175 3081086 ( yelling )
3083935 3085334 ( noise dies away )
3085415 3086370 Oh, for...
3086455 3087729 What did you<br />do wrong this time?
3087815 3088804 I don't know.
3088895 3090044 I calibrated the drive...
3090135 3091409 Go check the machine!
3091495 3093645 There must be something wrong<br />with the scream intake valve.
3093735 3096249 That's the problem<br />with these 3250 units...
3096335 3098246 Huh?
3101015 3102971 Hmm.
3112808 3114036 Psst!
3114128 3115402 Fungus.<br />Fungus.
3115488 3117479 You like cars, huh?
3117568 3118967 'Cause I got a really nice car.
3119048 3121278 If you let me go,<br />I'll give you...
3121368 3122596 a ride in the car.
3122688 3123962 Please, Fungus?
3124048 3125640 I'm sorry, Wazowski,<br />but Randall said
3125728 3128447 I'm not allowed to fraternize<br />with victims of his evil plot.
3128528 3129483 ( gasps )
3129568 3130887 ( clanging )
3130968 3132242 Hmm...
3133208 3134084 ( zapping )
3134168 3136159 ( electrical whirring )
3136248 3139240 ( clanking, rattling, whirring )
3139328 3140204 ( gasps )
3140288 3141164 ( ouffled screaos )
3141248 3141964 What happened?
3142048 3143686 Where's Wazowski?
3143768 3145360 ( ouffled screaos )
3145448 3147200 ( shuts off oachine )
3147288 3148482 Where is he?!
3148568 3150126 ( whiopering )
3150208 3151277 ( growls )
3151368 3152517 ( whiopering )
3152608 3153643 ( squeals )
3153728 3154877 Come on!
3154968 3156401 This is crazy.<br />He's going to kill us!
3156488 3158524 CD A AGENT:<br />Careful.<br />That could be contaminated.
3158608 3160087 We got to get out of here now!
3160168 3162557 We can start a whole new life<br />somewhere far away.
3162648 3163842 Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.!
3163928 3165646 Goodbye, Mr Waternoose!
3165728 3167047 No, Mike, wait!
3167128 3168447 Hey, what are you doing?
3168528 3169881 Follow me. I have an idea.
3169968 3172687 No! No, no, no, no,<br />no, no, no, no...
3172768 3174759 COMPUTER VOICE ( over P.A. ):<br />Simulation terminated.
3174848 3175997 WATERNOOSE:<br />No, no, no, no, no.
3176088 3177123 What was that?
3177208 3179847 You're trying to scare the kid,<br />not lull it to sleep.
3179928 3182761 I was going for a<br />snake/ ninja approach
3182848 3184076 with a little hissing.
3184168 3185044 ( hisses )
3185128 3187437 How many times<br />do I have to tell you?
3187528 3189041 It's all about presence!
3189128 3191005 About how you enter the room!
3191088 3192521 Mr Waternoose!
3192608 3194405 James! Perfect timing.
3194488 3195887 No, no. Sir, you<br />don't understand.
3195968 3197799 Ah, now, show these monsters<br />how it's done.
3197888 3198764 What? No, no,<br />I can't...
3198848 3199758 Sir...<br />sir, you have
3199848 3200724 to listen to me.
3200808 3201797 Pay attention, everyone.
3201888 3202764 You're about to see
3202848 3204167 the best in the business.
3204248 3205124 Reset the simulator.
3205208 3206084 But-but, sir!
3206168 3207396 MOTHER:<br />Good night, sweetheart.
3207488 3208762 ANIMATRONIC BO Y:<br />Night, Mom.
3208848 3209724 Kitty!
3209808 3210843 No, Boo, no, no!
3210928 3212486 Now, give us a big, loud roar.
3212568 3214240 Mr Waternoose,<br />there's no time for this.
3214328 3215920 Come on. What are you<br />waiting for? Roar!
3216008 3216884 But-but-but, sir!
3216968 3217684 Roar!
3217768 3218962 ( groans )
3219048 3220242 ( roaring ferociously )
3220328 3221761 ( shrieking in terror )
3221848 3223327 ( gasps )
3223408 3224443 ( roaring ferociously )
3224528 3225517 ( squeals )
3225608 3227803 ( Boo crying )
3227888 3228843 ( students applauding )
3228928 3229838 WATERNOOSE:<br />Well done.
3229928 3231566 Well done,James.
3231648 3233081 Boo?
3233168 3235682 -All right, gentlemen,<br />I hope you've learned...<br />-Right this way, everyone.
3235768 3237326 ...a valuable lesson<br />in scaring today.
3237408 3238761 ( fearful whioper )
3238848 3239997 ( whines softly )
3240088 3241441 Boo.
3241528 3242927 ( nervous grunt )
3243008 3244805 ( whining )
3245808 3247036 Boo?
3248008 3250124 ( panicked grunts )
3250208 3251323 ( door slaos )
3251408 3254047 Boo, it's me.
3254128 3255243 ( squealing )
3256208 3257641 ( gasps ):<br />The child!
3257728 3258683 Sir, she isn't toxic.
3258768 3260565 I know it sounds<br />crazy, but trust me.
3260648 3261524 Boo?
3261608 3262643 No, no, no, no.
3262728 3263604 It's okay.
3263688 3264757 I was just...
3264848 3265883 ( whiopering in fear )
3265968 3267765 No, no, no, no, no,<br />don't be scared.
3267848 3269486 That wasn't real.
3269568 3270683 It's just a...
3270768 3271803 I was just...
3271888 3273116 ( crying ):<br />No...
3275368 3277324 ( Boo continues crying )
3282288 3283607 ( Boo sobbing )
3283688 3284882 Boo.
3284968 3286481 MIKE:<br />...and he was going<br />to test it out
3286568 3288445 on that sweet,<br />little girl.
3288528 3290246 Boo.<br />Now that we<br />have her...
3290328 3291477 ...he is trying<br />to kill us.
3291568 3293160 This whole thing<br />is Randall's fault.
3293248 3294476 Randall?
3294568 3296877 Yes. And we can take<br />you to his secret lab,<br />which is right here
3296968 3297844 in this factory.
3297928 3299122 How could this happen?
3299208 3301005 Oh, how could this happen?
3301088 3303124 Does anyone else<br />know about this?
3303208 3304084 No, sir.
3304168 3305487 Good.
3305568 3308321 This company can't afford<br />any more bad publicity.
3308408 3312401 Now, before we do<br />anything else, let's...
3312488 3314718 take care of the child.
3318008 3321284 Oh, I never thought things<br />would come to this...
3321368 3324166 not in my factory.
3324248 3327320 I'm sorry you boys<br />got mixed up in this.
3327408 3328841 Especially you,James.
3328928 3330566 But now we can set
3330648 3333958 everything straight again<br />for the good of the company.
3334048 3335083 ( whirring )
3335168 3336521 ( thunk )
3336608 3337643 MIKE:<br />Uh...
3337728 3339844 sir, that's not her door.
3339928 3341441 I know, I know.
3344288 3345323 It's yours.
3345408 3346397 ( startled gasps )
3346488 3347477 ( grunts )
3347568 3349684 ( yelling )
3349768 3350564 No!
3351688 3352916 ( gasps )
3353008 3356967 ( voice echoing ):<br />Boo!
3359968 3360923 ( gasps )
3361008 3361963 No! No!
3362048 3363925 No! No! No! No!
3364008 3364963 No!
3365048 3366242 ( desperate grunts )
3366328 3367238 It's too late!
3367328 3368841 We're banished, genius.
3368928 3370680 We're in the human world!
3370768 3373965 Oh, what a great idea, going<br />to your old pal Waternoose!
3374048 3376118 Too bad he was in<br />on the whole thing!
3376208 3379723 All you had to do was listen<br />to me--just once!
3379808 3381878 But you didn't, did you?
3381968 3384323 You're still not listening!
3384408 3387081 ( yelling )
3387168 3391207 ( Sulley grunting and groaning )
3391288 3392323 Take that!
3392408 3394000 ( growling )
3394088 3395646 ( gasps in horror )
3398248 3400557 Welcome to the Himalayas!
3400648 3402878 ( wind gusting )
3402968 3404481 ''Abominable''!
3404568 3405444 ( chuckles )
3405528 3406722 Can you believe that?
3406808 3408526 Do I look abominable to you?
3408608 3411406 Why can't they call me<br />the Adorable Snowman or...
3411488 3414207 or the Agreeable Snowman,<br />for crying out loud?
3414288 3415516 I'm a nice guy.
3415608 3416802 Snow cone?
3416888 3417764 Yuck.
3417848 3418678 No, no, no.
3418768 3420281 Don't worry--<br />it's lemon.
3420368 3422404 Uh, how about<br />you, big fella?
3422488 3424558 Snow cone?
3424648 3429039 Did you see the way she...<br />looked at me?
3429128 3430561 ( sighs )
3430648 3432400 Ah, poor guy.
3432488 3433477 I understand.
3433568 3435160 It ain't easy<br />being banished.
3435248 3436442 Take my buddy, Bigfoot.
3436528 3437677 When he was banished
3437768 3440646 he fashioned an enormous diaper<br />out of poison ivy.
3440728 3442525 Wore it on his head<br />like a tiara.
3442608 3444087 Called himself King Itchy.
3444168 3446807 Ah, it won't be so hard for<br />you guys, though, you know.
3446888 3448241 I mean, how lucky<br />can you get?
3448328 3449761 Banished with your<br />best friend.
3449848 3451201 He is not my friend.
3451288 3453119 Oh. I just assumed you<br />were buddies, you know
3453208 3454687 when I saw you out<br />there in the snow
3454768 3455644 hugging and all that.
3455728 3456683 Look at that big jerk.
3456768 3458201 Ruined my life, and for what?
3458288 3459323 A stupid kid!
3459408 3461239 Because of you,<br />I am now stuck
3461328 3462761 in this frozen<br />wasteland!
3462848 3463758 Wasteland?
3463848 3466203 I think you mean wonderland!
3466288 3468597 I mean, how about<br />all this fabulous snow, huh?
3468688 3471077 Oh, and wait till you see<br />the local village.
3471168 3472681 Cutest thing in the world.
3472768 3474998 I haven't even mentioned<br />all the free yak's milk.
3475088 3476521 What... what did you say?
3476608 3477484 Yak's milk.
3477568 3479206 Milking a yak<br />ain't exactly a picnic.
3479288 3480926 You know, once you pick<br />the hairs out
3481008 3481963 it's very nutritious.
3482048 3483845 No, no. Something<br />about a village.
3483928 3485043 Where?<br />Are there kids in it?
3485128 3486038 Kids? Sure.
3486128 3487846 Tough kids, sissy kids,<br />kids who climb on rocks...
3487928 3488804 Where is it?!
3488888 3490207 It's at the bottom<br />of the mountain.
3490288 3491357 Around a three-day hike.
3491448 3492642 Oh, three days?!
3492728 3494047 We need to get there now!
3494128 3496244 ( thuop )
3498008 3498963 ( ding )
3504648 3506400 You want to go to the village?
3506488 3508524 Okay, rule number one<br />out here.
3508608 3509597 Always...
3509688 3510757 No.
3510848 3512998 Never go out in a blizzard.
3513088 3514646 We need to get to Boo.
3514728 3516081 ( grunts, then gasps )
3516168 3517886 Boo?!
3517968 3519287 What about us?
3519368 3520244 ( grunts )
3520328 3521920 Ever since that kid<br />came in
3522008 3523327 you've ignored<br />everything I've said
3523408 3524557 and now look where we are!
3525608 3528042 Oh, we were about<br />to break the record, Sulley.
3528128 3529561 We would have had it made!
3529648 3530763 None of that matters now.
3530848 3533237 None of it matter...
3533328 3534443 Wa-wait a second.
3534528 3536644 None of it matters?
3536728 3538207 ( sighs )
3538288 3539607 MIKE:<br />Okay.
3539688 3541599 That's.... no. Good. Great.
3541688 3544248 So, now the truth<br />comes out, doesn't it?
3544328 3547400 Oh, would you<br />look at that?
3547488 3549206 We're out of<br />snow cones, uh...
3549288 3550846 Let me... just go outside
3550928 3552077 and make some more.
3552168 3556446 Sulley, what about everything<br />we ever worked for?
3556528 3559600 Does that matter?<br />Huh?
3559688 3561519 And what about Celia?
3561608 3565203 I am never... never<br />going to see her again.
3565288 3566767 Doesn't that matter?
3570048 3571003 ( sighs )
3572208 3573607 What about me?
3573688 3575201 I'm your pal.
3575288 3577244 I'm... I'm your best friend.
3577328 3579364 Don't I matter?
3581128 3582561 ( sighs )
3582648 3583683 I'm sorry, Mike.
3583768 3586566 I'm sorry we're stuck out here.
3586648 3588718 I didn't mean<br />for this to happen.
3588808 3590366 But Boo's in trouble.
3590448 3592200 I think there might<br />be a way to save her
3592288 3593801 if we can just<br />get down to that...
3593888 3594764 ''We''?
3594848 3596566 Whoa, whoa, whoa. ''We''?
3596648 3597842 No.
3597928 3599759 There's no ''we'' this time, pal.
3599848 3602043 I-if-if you want<br />to go out there
3602128 3603322 and freeze to death
3603408 3605683 you be my guest...
3605768 3608601 because you're on your own.
3630728 3634084 ( wind whistles )
3643888 3646402 Hey, I got more snow cones!
3651448 3652358 Ohh!
3657088 3658043 Ahh!
3664768 3665200 Ahh!
3665288 3666164 ( yells )
3666248 3669240 ( grunting and groaning )
3672688 3675566 ( wind howling )
3677968 3681165 ( distant child screaoing )
3685168 3688080 ( children screaoing )
3691408 3692841 Oh, come on, now, George.
3692928 3694486 I know you can do this.
3694568 3697560 I picked out an easy door<br />for you-- in Nepal.
3697648 3699639 Nice, quiet Nepal.
3699728 3701320 You know, you're right.
3701408 3702557 Here, take this.
3702648 3704206 Go get 'em, Georgie!
3704288 3705926 Gangway! Look out!<br />Coming through!
3706008 3707202 Sorry, George.
3707288 3708562 Hey, you can't just...
3708648 3709524 ( gasps )
3709608 3710438 23...
3710528 3712166 ( gagging )
3715128 3716277 ( whistling )
3716368 3717483 Out of the way!
3717568 3718444 -Hey!<br />-Whoa!
3718528 3719927 Don't!
3720008 3721566 ( gasps )
3721648 3722637 ( whiopers )
3722728 3723922 Finally!
3724008 3726124 I never should have<br />trusted you with this.
3726208 3728517 Because of you, I had<br />to banish my top scarer!
3728608 3730838 With this machine,<br />we won't need scarers.
3730928 3733078 Besides, Sullivan got<br />what he deserved.
3733168 3736046 Sullivan was twice the scarer<br />you will ever be!
3736128 3737038 ( low growl )
3737128 3738197 ( panting )
3738288 3739164 ( clanging )
3739248 3740442 ( grunting )
3740528 3741802 ( yells with effort )
3743568 3746765 ( oechanical whirring )
3746848 3748361 ( gasps )
3748448 3750598 Kitty!
3750688 3751723 ( whirring and hissing )
3751808 3753366 ( yelling )
3753448 3754676 ( shrieking )
3754768 3755883 ( roaring )
3757488 3758284 Kitty!
3758368 3758959 Sullivan?
3759048 3760276 ( grunting )
3763008 3764885 Wh-whoa!
3764968 3766162 Kitty!
3766248 3767317 Sorry, Boo.
3767408 3768682 Stop him!
3768768 3769803 ( growls )
3769888 3772243 Let's get you home.
3772328 3772885 ( panting )
3772968 3773844 ( blow lands )
3773928 3774804 Ooh!
3774888 3776162 WATERNOOSE:<br />Finish him off!
3776248 3777158 Oh! Ooh! Oh!
3777248 3779079 ( clanging )
3780368 3781323 ( thunk )
3782848 3784361 You don't know how long
3784448 3787121 I've wanted to do<br />that, Sullivan.
3787208 3788084 ( grunts )
3788168 3789567 ( chuckles )
3789648 3791559 ( punches landing )
3791648 3792558 Hah!
3792648 3793364 Ooh!
3793448 3794676 ( shrieks )
3796088 3797726 ( panting )
3797808 3798718 Ooh!
3798808 3799718 Mike?!
3799808 3801480 Look, it's not that I<br />don't care about the kid.
3801568 3802796 Mike, you don't<br />understand.
3802888 3804560 Yes, I do. I was<br />just mad, that's all.
3804648 3805922 I needed some time to think.
3806008 3807885 But you shouldn't<br />have left me out there.
3807968 3808878 ( thuop )
3808968 3810287 I'm being attacked!
3810368 3811562 No, I'm not attacking you.
3811648 3812717 I'm trying to be honest.
3812808 3813684 Just hear me out.
3813768 3814917 You and I are a team.
3815008 3817522 Nothing is more important<br />than our friendship.
3817608 3818484 I-I-I know, kid.
3818568 3819683 He's too sensitive.
3819768 3821247 ( gagging )
3821328 3822044 ( whining cry )
3822128 3823402 Come on, pal.
3823488 3825046 If you start crying,<br />I'm going to cry
3825128 3826481 and I'll never get through this.
3826568 3828957 I'm sorry<br />I wasn't there for you
3829048 3829924 but I am now.
3830008 3830758 Ow!
3830848 3832201 Sulley, I am baring<br />my soul here.
3832288 3834279 The least you could do<br />is pay attention!
3835288 3836801 ( yells in pain )
3836888 3838765 ( sighs in relief )
3838848 3840964 Hey, look at that--<br />it's Randall! It's...
3841048 3841878 Oh.
3841968 3843162 Come on!
3843248 3844442 WATERNOOSE:<br />Get up!
3844528 3846325 There can't be<br />any witnesses.
3846408 3847557 There won't be.
3847648 3849081 I'm glad you came back, Mike.
3849168 3851557 Somebody's gotta take care<br />of you, you big hair ball.
3851648 3852558 ( Celia screaoing )
3852648 3854206 ( screaoing )
3854288 3855164 Ow!
3855248 3857125 Schmoopsie-poo,<br />I really can't talk.
3857208 3858163 Come on!
3858248 3859681 Michael, if you<br />don't tell me
3859768 3861884 what's going on right<br />now, we are through!
3861968 3863037 You hear me? Through!
3863128 3864197 Here's the truth.
3864288 3865926 You know the kid that they're<br />looking for-- Sulley let her in.
3866008 3866918 We tried to<br />send her back
3867008 3868202 but Waternoose<br />had this secret plot
3868288 3870597 and now Randall's right behind<br />us and he's trying to kill us!
3870688 3873805 You expect me to believe that<br />pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?!
3873888 3875116 Mike Wazowski!
3875208 3876357 ( startled yell )

3920292 3922362 MIKE:<br />Sulley, what are we doing?
3922452 3925489 We have to get Boo's door<br />and find a station.
3925572 3928962 MIKE:<br />What a plan--<br />simple, yet insane!
3929052 3931043 ( growls )
3931132 3932406 Whoa.

4014772 4016728 Why couldn't we<br />get banished here?
4016812 4018928 Come on. We got to<br />find another door.
4019932 4020887 ( gasps )

4088652 4089528 Get it open!
4089612 4091204 -I'm trying!<br />-Open the door!
4091292 4092771 Come on, get in here!
4095932 4097445 ( Boo crying )
4099172 4101606 ( grunting )
4101692 4102886 Boo!
4102972 4105122 ( panting )
4105212 4106201 ( panting )
4106292 4107247 There they are!
4111212 4112850 Sulley, what are you doing?
4112932 4114251 Sulley!
4114332 4115208 ( grunts )
4115292 4116168 ( grunts )
4116252 4117128 ( yells )
4117212 4119885 Looks like we caught<br />the express, pal.
4119972 4121007 Do you see them?
4121092 4122525 Straight ahead!
4124452 4125601 No...
4125692 4127648 ( stifled cry )
4133772 4135842 ( grunting nervously )
4145492 4146208 Kitty!
4146292 4147281 Boo!
4147812 4148881 ( yelling )
4148972 4151964 ( whiopering )
4152052 4156568 RAND ALL:<br />Look at everybody's<br />favourite scarer now!
4156652 4158927 You stupid, pathetic waste!
4159012 4159967 ( thuop )
4162012 4164890 You've been number one<br />for too long, Sullivan.
4164972 4167008 Now your time is up!
4167092 4168810 And don't worry.
4168892 4171884 I'll take good care of the kid.
4171972 4172848 No!
4172932 4174524 ( yelling )
4174612 4177490 ( Boo grunting<br />~ and Randall gagging )
4177572 4179244 ( Randall groaning )
4189652 4191643 ( gagging )
4191732 4193484 ( roaring angrily )
4193572 4195528 She's not scared<br />of you any more.
4195612 4197045 ( roars angrily )
4197132 4199202 Looks like you're out of a job.
4199292 4200407 ( gulps )
4200492 4201527 All right, come on,<br />over the plate.
4201612 4202681 Let's see<br />the ol' stuff here, pal.
4202772 4204330 Come on, now, chuck him,<br />chuck him, baby. Hum, baby.
4204412 4205401 Hum, baby,<br />here's the pitch.
4205492 4206720 Wait, please, don't,<br />don't, don't!
4206812 4207642 No!
4207732 4208608 And he is...<br />out of here!
4208692 4209761 ( crickets chirping )
4209852 4212320 BO Y:<br />Mama, another gator<br />got in the house.
4212412 4213288 Another gator?!
4213372 4215124 Give me that shovel!<br />Come here!
4215212 4216611 ( clanging, yelling )
4216692 4218489 Get him, Mama!<br />Get that gator!
4219532 4220885 Care to do the honours,<br />Mikey?
4220972 4223645 With pleasure.
4228172 4229924 ( thud )
4230012 4231286 ( baby talk )
4231372 4232600 That's right, Boo.
4232692 4233727 You did it.
4233812 4234847 You beat him.
4234932 4235808 ( raspberry )
4235892 4237291 Come on.
4239372 4241408 Okay, Boo,<br />it's time to go home.
4241492 4243642 Take care of yourself,<br />and be a good girl, okay?
4243732 4244767 ( gasps )
4244852 4245841 Oh, no!
4245932 4246808 The power's out!
4246892 4248245 Make her laugh again.
4248332 4249526 All right, I got a move here.
4249612 4250806 It'll bring down the house.
4250892 4251961 Up...
4252052 4253087 ( oetallic clang )
4253172 4254207 ( groans softly )
4254292 4256522 Oh, sorry, she didn't see that.
4256612 4258045 What?! What'd you do,<br />forget to check
4258132 4259121 if her stupid hood was up
4259212 4260281 ya big dope?!
4260372 4262567 ( singsong ):<br />Uncle Mike, try not to yell<br />in front of her.
4262652 4264085 You know we still need her<br />to laugh.
4264172 4265048 Right.
4265132 4266008 ( laughs )
4266092 4267650 Hey, Boo, just kidding. Look!
4267732 4268608 ( gibberish )
4268692 4270125 Funny, right? Huh?<br />See what the...
4270212 4271281 These are the jokes, kid.
4271372 4272407 Whoa!
4272492 4274130 What's happening?
4274212 4276442 SULLEY:<br />Hold on!
4276532 4279410 When the door lands<br />in this station, cut the power.
4279492 4282484 You'll have the child<br />and the criminals responsible
4282572 4284847 for this whole mess.
4284932 4286809 Great.<br />A welcoming committee!
4286892 4288564 What are we going to do?!
4288652 4292167 ( electrical huooing )
4294492 4295925 ( clang )
4299772 4300807 This is the CD A.
4300892 4301927 Come out slowly
4302012 4303525 with the child<br />in plain sight.
4303612 4305762 Okay, okay.
4305852 4306728 You got us.
4306812 4307801 Here we are.
4307892 4308802 Here's the kid.
4308892 4310325 I'm cooperating.
4310412 4312209 But before you take us away,<br />I have one thing to say:
4312292 4313168 ( gags )
4313252 4314526 Catch!
4314612 4316443 ( all shouting ):<br />231 9!
4316532 4318124 We have a toxic<br />projectile!
4318212 4319770 Halt! After the suspect!
4319852 4321205 Cover the area!<br />Bring in reinforcements!
4321292 4322691 WATERNOOSE:<br />Stop him!
4322772 4325286 ( Boo squeaks )
4325372 4326441 Come on.
4326532 4328648 Don't let them get away.
4328732 4329608 What...?!
4329692 4330727 No, wait, wait!
4330812 4332370 Come back!<br />He has the child!
4332452 4333646 ( frustrated growl )
4335732 4337404 ( Boo squeaks )
4337492 4339881 Sullivan? Sullivan!
4339972 4341451 Give me the child!
4341532 4342647 Me not go!
4342732 4343608 Give her to me!
4344772 4346842 ( panting )
4346932 4348365 ( grunts )
4350172 4351969 ( oetallic creaking )
4352052 4356250 WATERNOOSE:<br />Open this door!<br />Open this door!
4356332 4357924 ( growling and pounding )
4358012 4359730 Hey!
4359812 4361211 Sullivan!
4361292 4362122 ( yells )
4362212 4363884 WATERNOOSE:<br />Don't do it.
4363972 4364643 ( beep )
4364732 4365403 Come on.
4365492 4368370 Don't go in that room!
4368452 4369965 ( yelling )
4370052 4372247 I think we stopped him, Boo.
4372332 4373367 You're safe now.
4373452 4376524 You be a good girl, okay?
4376612 4379001 This has gone<br />far enough,James.
4379092 4380320 She's home now!<br />Just leave her alone!
4380412 4381447 I can't do that!
4381532 4382567 She's seen too much.
4382652 4384210 You both have.
4384292 4385691 It doesn't have to be this way.
4385772 4387285 I have no choice!
4387372 4388361 Times have changed.
4388452 4389965 Scaring isn't enough any more.
4390052 4391405 But kidnapping children?!
4391492 4393005 I'll kidnap<br />a thousand children
4393092 4394445 before I let<br />this company die
4394532 4396204 and I'll silence anyone
4396292 4398044 who gets in my way!
4398132 4399360 No!
4399452 4401602 ( child's voice ):<br />Good night, Mom.
4401692 4403284 ( wooan's voice ):<br />Good night, sweetheart.
4403372 4404248 Good night, Mom.
4404332 4406482 What, wh-what is this?!<br />What? Who? Huh?
4406572 4408847 COMPUTER:<br />Simulation terminated.<br />Simulation terminated.
4408932 4410763 Well, I don't know<br />about the rest of you guys
4410852 4412649 but I spotted<br />several big mistakes.
4412732 4414165 But-but-but how-how did...?<br />How did...?
4414252 4415287 MIKE:<br />You know what?
4415372 4418011 Let's watch my favourite part<br />again... shall we?
4418092 4421084 ( repeating ):<br />I'll kidnap a thousand children<br />before I let this company die.
4421172 4422924 What...? Wha...?
4423012 4424923 I'll kidnap<br />a thousand children before...
4425012 4426286 ( baby talk )
4426372 4427725 Shh, shh, shh, shh!
4427812 4429211 Shh!
4429292 4430168 I'll get him.
4430252 4431287 All right,<br />come with us, sir.
4431372 4432441 Wh-what are<br />you doing?
4432532 4433408 Take your<br />hands off me!
4433492 4434527 You can't arrest me!
4434612 4435727 I hope you're happy, Sullivan!
4435812 4438007 You've destroyed this company.<br />Monsters, Incorporated is dead!
4438092 4440606 Where will everyone<br />get their scream now?!
4440692 4442842 The energy crisis<br />will only get worse
4442932 4444445 because of you!
4444532 4445760 ( loud clang )
4447452 4449602 Stay where you are.
4449692 4450522 Huh?
4450612 4451931 Number One<br />wants to talk to you.
4452012 4454048 Attention!
4459812 4461723 Hello, boys.
4461812 4462722 BOTH:<br />Roz?!
4462812 4466566 Two and a half years<br />of undercover work
4466652 4468483 were almost wasted
4468572 4472008 when you intercepted<br />that child, Mr Sullivan.
4472092 4475448 Of course, without your help,<br />I never would have known
4475532 4478251 that this went all the way up<br />to Waternoose.
4478332 4480004 ( baby talk )
4480092 4481571 ( gasps )
4481652 4482846 ROZ:<br />Now...
4482932 4484411 about the girl...
4484492 4487529 I just want to<br />send her home.
4487612 4488681 Very good.
4488772 4489807 ( chioing tones )
4489892 4491484 Bring me a door shredder.
4491572 4494484 What, you mean... you mean,<br />I can't see her again?
4494572 4497803 That's the way it has to be.
4497892 4500850 I'll give you<br />five minutes.
4505732 4507006 ( whirring huo )
4511012 4512570 Well, so long, kid.
4512652 4514449 Mike Wazowski!
4514532 4515885 Yeah.
4515972 4521000 Ah, Boo,<br />it's been fun.
4521092 4522286 Go ahead.
4522372 4524761 Go grow up.
4530572 4532528 ( door creaking )
4535092 4537242 ( squealing in delight )
4537332 4538447 ( laughing )
4542732 4543608 Uh-uh, B-Boo...?
4543692 4544568 ( speaking baby talk )
4544652 4545687 Um... Boo?
4545772 4547125 ( speaking baby talk )
4547212 4548247 Oh, look at that.
4548332 4550482 Yeah, you know...
4550572 4552244 Oh, that's cute, yeah.
4552332 4553321 ( baby talk )
4553412 4554481 Uh, Boo, um...
4554572 4555482 ( squeaking toy )
4555572 4556925 Well, that's very nice.
4557012 4558684 ( giggling )
4558772 4560046 Come here, you!
4560132 4561360 ( squeals )
4561452 4563408 ( both laughing )
4567932 4570571 Oh, he's a happy bear...
4570652 4572131 ( giggling )
4572212 4574248 ( baby talk )
4576012 4577764 Nothing's coming<br />out of your closet
4577852 4579251 to scare you<br />any more, right?
4579332 4580401 Mm...
4580492 4582801 Yeah.
4582892 4585247 Goodbye, Boo.
4585332 4587766 Kitty.
4587852 4589922 Kitty has to go.
4628612 4630682 Boo!
4630772 4632922 ( gasps )
4633012 4635890 Kitty?
4635972 4638247 ( ootor buzzing loudly )
4641652 4642846 ( clicks off )
4642932 4644206 None of this
4644292 4647090 ever happened, gentlemen.
4647172 4651688 And I don't want to see<br />any paperwork on this.
4654012 4656082 ( door closes )
4672412 4674448 Take him away.
4674532 4676363 ( all ourouring )
4676452 4678283 I bet we get<br />the rest of the day off.
4678372 4679407 You idiot!
4679492 4681483 They're going<br />to shut down the factory!
4681572 4683164 ( all gasp )
4683252 4685208 I'm telling you, pal,<br />when that wall went up
4685292 4687647 you should have seen the look<br />on Waternoose's face.
4687732 4689802 Whoo-hoo! I hope we get<br />a copy of that tape.
4689892 4690961 Hey, you all right?
4691052 4693043 Come on, pal,<br />cheer up, we did it!
4693132 4694121 We got Boo home.
4694212 4696442 Ah, sure, we put the factory<br />in the toilet, and...
4696532 4698762 gee, hundreds of people<br />will be out of work now.
4698852 4701082 Not to mention the angry mob<br />that'll come after us
4701172 4702969 when there's no more power,<br />but, hey...
4703052 4705930 at least we had<br />some laughs, right?
4708012 4710731 Laughs...
4710812 4711961 ( crickets chirping )
4712052 4713724 ( wind blowing softly )
4713812 4716451 ( door quietly creaks open )
4725692 4726841 ( boy gasps )
4729292 4730691 Hey, is this thing on?<br />Hello?
4730772 4732364 Hello?<br />Testing, testing.
4732452 4733771 Hey, good evening.<br />How are you?
4733852 4735080 How are you?<br />Nice to see you.
4735172 4737083 I tell you, it's good<br />to be here in... your room.
4737172 4738241 Where you from?
4738332 4739481 Never mind.
4739572 4741483 You're in<br />kindergarten, right?
4741572 4742607 Oh, I love kindergarten.
4742692 4744364 Best three years of my life.
4745332 4746651 Of my life.
4746732 4747608 But I love sports.
4747692 4748886 Dodgeball was the best.
4748972 4749848 Oh, yeah.
4749932 4751285 I was the fastest one out there.
4751372 4752930 Course I was the ball.
4753012 4754650 But I...
4754732 4756165 was the ball, see?
4756252 4757844 All right.
4761892 4763405 ( ruobling )
4763492 4764925 ( ruobling gets louder )
4765012 4766127 ( gurgling )
4766212 4768043 Ah...
4768132 4769247 ( huge burp )
4769332 4770401 Ah?
4770492 4771925 ( laughing )
4772012 4773127 Hey, thanks a lot.
4773212 4774281 I'll be here all week.
4774372 4775964 Remember to tip your waitresses.
4776052 4777690 ( guffawing )
4777772 4779046 ( rippling gurgle )
4779132 4780281 ( bell dings )
4780372 4781600 Great job, Mikey.
4781692 4783808 You filled your quota on<br />the first kid of the day.
4783892 4784881 Not bad, huh?
4784972 4787042 You know, only somebody<br />with perfect comedic timing
4787132 4788804 could produce this much energy<br />in one shot.
4788892 4790325 Uh-huh, and the fact<br />that laughter is
4790412 4791845 ten times more<br />powerful than scream
4791932 4792967 had nothing to do with it.
4793052 4794041 ( clears throat )
4794132 4795360 CELIA:<br />Oh, Googley Bear.
4795452 4797647 Come here, you.
4797732 4798608 Schmoopsie-poo!
4798692 4799602 Googley.
4799692 4800681 Whoa!
4800772 4801807 ( snakes chittering )
4801892 4802927 ( Mike giggling )
4803012 4803967 Girls!<br />Girls, put...
4804052 4806168 Stop, stop, stop!
