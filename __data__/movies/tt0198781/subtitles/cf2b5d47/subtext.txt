2272771 2275065 I just have no idea.

2316690 2319526 Well, isn't that nice?

2393600 2396937 Be quiet. Don't you think<br />I'm aware of the situation?
2397021 2399106 I was up all night trying to find it.
2399189 2403318 I did a calculation factoring in<br />the size of the sushi restaurant.
2403402 2404945 The child may have escaped!
2405029 2407865 Until we know for sure<br />we're gonna act like nothing happened.

2436977 2439688 Right. We're just two regular Joes<br />on our way to work.
2439772 2441357 We will blend right in.

2444318 2446612 Did you lose weight?<br />Or a limb?
2446862 2449156 -You have her card key, right?<br />-Of course.
2449198 2451950 I told you I'd get her card key.<br />I went and got it.
2451992 2453994 Now I have her card key.
2455079 2456455 OK. Here we go.
2457456 2461126 Take care of yourself. Try not to<br />run through any more closets.
2464713 2467675 -Mike, that's not her door.<br />-Of course it's her door.
2467758 2470302 No. Her door was white<br />and it had flowers on it.

2497454 2498497 There a problem?
2498539 2500040 Sulley, you're not supposed to name it.
2500082 2502918 Once you name it,<br />you start getting attached to it.

2639054 2642266 Cheating? Cheating. Right.
2642683 2645811 OK. I think I know<br />how to make this all go away.
2646311 2650024 What happens when the whistle blows<br />in five minutes?
2651025 2654486 -I get a timeout?<br />-Everyone goes to lunch.

4385843 4387928 That's right, Boo. You did it.
4387970 4389596 You beat him.
4389805 4391223 Come on.
4394226 4395728 OK, Boo, it's time to go home.

4400524 4402776 -Oh, no.<br />-The power's out. Make her laugh.
4402818 4405904 I got a move here<br />that'll bring down the house.
4409783 4412036 -Sorry. She didn't see that.<br />-What?
4412119 4415247 What, did you forget to check<br />if her hood was up, you big dope?
4415289 4418292 Uncle Mike, try not to yell<br />in front of her.
4418417 4421128 -You know we need her to laugh.<br />-Right.
4421420 4423672 Hey, Boo. Just kidding. Look.
4424214 4426258 Funny, right? See, with the...

4521520 4522980 Don't do it.
4524440 4526734 -Come on.<br />-WATERNOOSE: Don't go in that room.
4530738 4533657 I think we stopped him, Boo.<br />You're safe now.
4533741 4535617 You be a good girl, OK?
4536910 4540581 -This has gone far enough, James.<br />-She's home. Leave her alone.
4540622 4543250 I can't do that.<br />She's seen too much.
4543375 4546045 -You both have.<br />-It doesn't have to be this way.
4546086 4548881 I have no choice. Times have changed.
4548922 4552009 -Scaring isn't enough anymore.<br />-But kidnapping?
4552092 4555137 I'll kidnap 1,000 children<br />before I let the company die.

4636427 4638303 Of course, without your help,
4638345 4642433 I never would have known that<br />this went all the way up to Waternoose.
4646562 4648981 Now, about the girl.
4649690 4651942 I just want to send her home.
