196601 198644 Simulation terminated.
198937 203607 -All right. Mr. Bile, is it?<br />-My friends call me Phlegm.
204609 207194 Mr. Bile, can you tell me<br />what you did wrong?
207278 210614 -I fell down?<br />-No, no, before that.
211074 214117 Can anyone tell me<br />Mr. Bile's big mistake?
215119 216286 Anyone?
218081 220958 Let's take a look at the tape.<br />Here we go.
221417 223877 Right there.
223962 226505 See? The door.<br />You left it wide open.
227674 230550 And leaving the door open<br />is the worst mistake
230635 233804 any employee can make because. . .
234639 238809 -It could let in a draft?<br />-It could let in a child.
239560 241311 Mr. Waternoose.
241479 246233 There's nothing more toxic or deadly<br />than a human child.
246484 248694 A single touch could kill you.
249487 253490 Leave a door open and a child<br />could walk right into this factory,
253658 255242 right into the monster world.
255326 257786 I won't go in a kid's room.<br />You can't make me.
257870 261039 You're going in there<br />because we need this.
267630 271758 Our city is counting on you<br />to collect those children's screams.
271843 274636 Without scream we have no power.
275096 276805 Yes, it's dangerous work.
276889 279766 And that's why I need you<br />to be at your best.
279851 283645 I need scarers who are<br />confident, tenacious, tough.
284022 285480 Intimidating.
285815 291194 I need scarers like. . .<br />Like James P. Sullivan.
294782 298285 Hey, good morning, Monstropolis.<br />It's five after 6:00 a.m.
298369 300120 in the big Monster City.
300204 303915 The temperature's a balmy 65 degrees<br />which is good for you reptiles.
304000 308045 And it looks like it's gonna be<br />a perfect day to lie in bed, sleep in,
308254 312674 or simply work off that flab<br />that's hanging over the bed !
312759 314343 Get up, Sulley!
316512 318972 I don't believe I ordered<br />a wake-up call, Mikey.
319057 321641 Less talk, more pain,<br />marshmallow boy!
322226 325020 Feel the burn.<br />You call yourself a monster?
325355 327647 Scary feet, scary feet.<br />The kid's awake!
327732 330442 Scary feet, scary feet, scary feet.<br />Kid's asleep!
331944 333820 Twins! In a bunk bed !
335573 337199 I thought I had you there.
337283 340911 OK, Sulley, here we go.<br />You ready? Follow it. It's over here.
340995 344539 Over there. Don't let the kid touch you.<br />Don't let him touch you !
344665 348043 I don't know but it's been said<br />I love scarin' kids in bed
348127 351505 Fight that plaque.<br />Scary monsters don't have plaque.
351589 353924 One-eighteen. Do you have 1 1 9?
354008 355634 Do I see 1 20?
355802 358387 -I don't believe it.<br />-I'm not breaking a sweat.
358471 360847 Not you. Look!<br />The new commercial's on.

371943 374820 -l'm Monsters, lncorporated.<br />-Hey, look! Betty!
374904 378365 Carefully matching every child<br />to their ideal monster,
378449 380534 to produce superior scream.
380618 383453 Refined into clean,<br />dependable energy.
383663 388208 Every time you turn something on.<br />Monsters, lncorporated is there.
388292 391753 -l'm Monsters, lncorporated.<br />-We know the challenge.
391838 393839 The window of innocence is shrinking.
393923 396425 Human kids are harder to scare.
396509 399052 Of course.<br />Ml is prepared for the future.
399137 401054 With the top scarers,
401139 402806 the best refineries,
402890 405600 and research into<br />new energy techniques.

429459 432127 Hello?<br />I know! Wasn't I great?
432378 434754 Did the whole family see it?<br />It's your mom.
434839 436673 What can I say?<br />The camera loves me.

520922 524216 I hear somebody's close to breaking<br />the all-time scare record.
524717 528387 Just trying to make sure<br />there's enough scream to go around.
528471 531181 -Hey, on the house.<br />-Hey, thanks.

616142 618143 -Happy birthday.<br />-Thanks.
618478 621480 So are we going<br />anywhere special tonight?
621689 626026 I just got us into a little place<br />called Harryhausen's.
626652 630364 Harryhausen's? But it's impossible<br />to get a reservation there.
630448 633909 Not for googly bear.<br />I will see you at quittin' time.
633993 636078 -Not a minute later.<br />-OK, sweetheart.
636162 637996 Think romantical thoughts.

648883 651343 Thanks for hooking me up<br />with those reservations.
651427 654513 They're under the name "googly bear."
654597 657599 Good. . .<br />You know, that wasn't very funny.
661020 663355 -What the. . .<br />-Wazowski.
665400 666400 What do you know?
666484 669361 It scares little kids<br />and little monsters.
669695 672948 I wasn't scared.<br />I have allergies.
674450 677327 -Sure.<br />-Randall, save it for the scare floor.
677412 681289 I'm in the zone today, Sullivan.<br />Gonna do serious scaring.
681374 684543 -Putting up some big numbers.<br />-Randall, that's great.
684627 688797 That should make it more humiliating<br />when we break the record first.
690216 693969 Do you hear that?<br />It's the winds of change.
696764 698723 "You hear that? It's the winds of. . ."
698808 701810 What a creep.<br />One of these days I am really
702311 704729 gonna let you<br />teach that guy a lesson.

718995 722205 -Who would we be scaring today?<br />-Wazowski.
722290 724791 You didn't file your paperwork<br />last night.
724876 726710 Oh, that darn paperwork.
726794 730130 Wouldn't it be easier<br />if it all just blew away?
731174 734009 Don't let it happen again.
734135 737179 Yes. Well, I'll try to be less careless.
737263 740098 I'm watching you, Wazowski.
740224 742267 Always watching.
742393 744436 -She's nuts.<br />-Always.
745438 747731 All scare floors are now active.
748149 751026 Assistants, please report<br />to your stations.
797782 800867 OK, people,<br />Eastern Seaboard coming online.
800952 802994 We got scarers coming out.
817843 820095 They are so awesome.
866809 869227 Hey, may the best monster win.

885077 887954 You're the boss.<br />You're the big hairy boss.
897590 899716 I'm feeling good today, Mikey.
901510 904137 Attaboy. Another door coming right up.
911771 913355 You're still behind, Randall.
913439 916524 -Maybe I should realign the scream. . .<br />-Get me a door.
916609 917942 Door, yes, door.
943636 945887 Well, Jerry, what's the damage so far?
945971 949140 We may actually<br />make our quota today, sir.
949433 951309 First time in a month.
958651 960735 -What happened?<br />-The kid almost touched me.
960820 963947 -She got this close to me.<br />-She wasn't scared of you?
964073 966491 -She was only six.<br />-I could have been dead.
966575 970286 -I could have died.<br />-Keep it together, man.
971205 973623 Hey, we got a dead door over here.
973916 976000 -I'm coming.<br />-Look out.
976919 978294 Excuse us.
981173 983717 We've lost 58 doors this week, sir.
984260 985844 Kids these days.
985928 988138 They just don't get scared<br />like they used to.
988681 990181 Let her rip.
1002069 1003737 -Sir?<br />-What?
1004071 1005363 Look.
1006991 1009701 Attention.<br />We have a new scare leader.
1009785 1011411 Randall Boggs.
1013122 1014831 Look at those numbers.
1020212 1021713 Slumber party.
1024717 1026384 Never mind.
1027428 1028928 Hey, watch it.
1030681 1033850 Well, James,<br />that was an impressive display.
1033934 1036227 Just doing my job, Mr. Waternoose.
1036312 1038730 'Course I did learn from the best.
1039398 1042317 If I don't see a new door<br />in my station in five seconds,
1042401 1045487 I will personally<br />put you through the shredder.
1046655 1050575 Hey, Wazowski, nice job.<br />Those numbers are pretty sweet.
1050659 1053203 Are they?<br />You know, I hadn't even noticed.
1053287 1055997 -And how's Georgie doing?<br />-He's doing great.
1056081 1058082 I love working with that big guy.
1058167 1060627 Keep the doors coming.<br />I'm on a roll today.
1060711 1064422 George and I are like brothers. 231 9!
1064548 1066591 We have a 231 9!
1071096 1072347 Red alert.

1075434 1077560 -Red alert.<br />-George Sanderson.
1077645 1081606 Please remain motionless.<br />Prepare for decontamination.
1081690 1083691 Duck and cover, people!
1086862 1089030 Not the CDA.
1096413 1099415 -Go, go, go.<br />-Coming through. Stand aside.
1099500 1101000 Clear the contaminated area.
1101710 1105839 -A 231 9 in progress.<br />-Coming through. Watch yourself.
1110261 1112554 Stand back. Careful.
1127945 1131406 All clear. Situation is<br />niner-niner-zero. Ready for decon.
1131490 1134701 -Thanks, guys, that was a close one.<br />-OK.
1146624 1150085 Take a break. We gotta shut down<br />and reset the system.
1150169 1152712 An entire scare floor out of commission.
1152797 1154714 What else can go wrong?
1157468 1160345 -What a day.<br />-We're just going through a rough time.
1160429 1162639 Everyone knows<br />you'll get us through it.
1162723 1165266 Tell that to the board of directors.
1166352 1170855 James, this company's been<br />in my family for three generations.
1170940 1174109 I would do anything<br />to keep it from going under.
1174193 1175957 So would I, sir.
1177919 1180837 -I could use your help with something.<br />-Anything, sir.
1180922 1185383 We've hired some new scare recruits,<br />and frankly, they're. . .
1186093 1188595 -Inexperienced?<br />-They stink.
1189138 1191348 I thought maybe<br />you might come by tomorrow
1191432 1193517 and give them a demonstration.
1193643 1196520 Show them what it takes<br />to be our top scarer.
1196604 1199940 I'll start out with the old<br />Waternoose jump and growl.
1203569 1205195 Now that's my boy.
1211786 1214996 Let's go, everybody.<br />All doors must be returned.
1215122 1216873 No exceptions.
1222797 1225507 I've never seen anything like you today.<br />You were on a roll.
1225591 1228426 Another day like this<br />and that scare record's in the bag.
1228511 1230011 That's right, baby.
1234475 1237936 As if dinner wasn't enough,<br />I'm taking her to a monster truck rally.
1238020 1239521 -Nice.<br />-What's on your agenda?
1239605 1242023 -Work out some more.<br />-Again?
1242191 1244693 There's more to life than scaring.
1245403 1250574 -Can I borrow your odorant?<br />-I got smelly garbage or old dumpster.
1250658 1253577 You got low tide?<br />How about wet dog?
1253661 1255245 Yep. Stink it up.
1258374 1261042 I am so romantic sometimes<br />I think I should marry myself.
1261127 1264129 -Give me a break.<br />-What a night of romance ahead of me.
1264213 1267507 Tonight is about me and Celia.
1268009 1270886 The love boat is about to set sail.
1272013 1275932 I gotta tell you, that face of hers,<br />it just makes my heart go. . .
1276058 1280270 Hello, Wazowski.<br />Fun-filled evening planned for tonight?
1280354 1281605 Well, as a matter of fact. . .
1281689 1285066 I'm sure you filed<br />your paperwork correctly,
1285443 1286818 for once.
1287987 1291615 Your stunned silence<br />is very reassuring.
1291824 1294075 My scare reports.<br />I left them on my desk.
1294201 1297537 If I'm not at the restaurant in five<br />minutes they'll give our table away.
1297663 1299205 -Schmoopsie-pooh.<br />-Googly bear.
1299290 1302125 -Want to get going?<br />-Do I ever. It's just. . .
1302209 1303543 -What?<br />-It. . .
1303628 1305795 -A small. . .<br />-I don't understand.
1305880 1308298 I forgot about some paperwork<br />I was supposed to file.
1308382 1310091 Mike was reminding me.
1310176 1312052 -Thanks, buddy.<br />-I was?
1312386 1313637 I mean, I was. Yeah.
1313721 1315889 -OK. Let's go.<br />-We're going.
1316933 1317933 The pink copies to accounting.
1318017 1321728 The fuchsia ones go to purchasing<br />and the goldenrod ones go to Roz.
1321812 1323313 Leave the puce.
1326150 1328818 Pink copies to accounting,<br />fuchsia ones to Roz.
1328903 1330904 The fuchsia ones go to purchasing.
1331072 1332739 The goldenrod ones go to Roz.
1333240 1335742 Man, I have no idea what puce is.
1339038 1340288 Oh, that's puce.
1345795 1347253 Hello?
1347505 1350924 Anyone? There's a door here.
1371737 1373530 Hello? Hey.
1374740 1376282 Anybody scaring in here?
1377034 1379244 Hello. Yo.
1491023 1492148 Kitty.
1493234 1494984 No, no, stay back.
1557798 1559465 Hold it, hold it.
1569018 1572896 Michael, I've had a lot of birthdays. . .<br />Well, not a lot of birthdays.
1572980 1575273 But this is the best birthday ever.
1577109 1578401 What are you looking at?
1578485 1581571 I was just thinking about<br />the first time I laid eye on you,
1581655 1584115 -how pretty you looked.<br />-Stop it.
1584200 1587911 -Your hair was shorter.<br />-I'm thinking about getting it cut.
1587995 1589954 No, no, I like it this length.
1590164 1591497 I like everything about you.
1592041 1595627 Just the other day someone asked<br />who was the most beautiful monster.
1596503 1598630 -You know what I said?<br />-What did you say?
1598714 1600006 I said. . .
1600549 1602217 -Sulley?<br />-Sulley?
1602301 1604802 No, no, that's not what<br />I was gonna say.
1604887 1605970 You're not making sense.
1606055 1609974 -He's handsome. He's rugged.<br />-What a coincidence, running into you.
1610226 1612644 -I'm just gonna order something.<br />-Michael.
1612895 1615355 -What's good?<br />-You're ruining everything.
1615439 1618274 I went to get your paperwork<br />and there was a door.
1618359 1619525 What?
1621862 1623613 -A door?<br />-Randall was in it.
1623697 1627242 Randall? That cheater.<br />He's trying to boost his numbers.
1627326 1628952 -There's something else.<br />-What?
1629036 1631079 Ooklay in the agbay.
1631413 1633331 -What?<br />-Look in the bag.
1634375 1635541 What bag?
1643300 1646636 They don't have anything<br />I like here. Take care, Celia.
1646720 1650014 -What's going on?<br />-Celia, please try to understand.
1650224 1653184 -I have to do something !<br />-Michael?
1654228 1657021 On three. One, two. . .
1659191 1660692 -A kid !<br />-Boo!
1665906 1667073 A kid !
1668867 1670994 There's a kid here.<br />A human kid !
1675040 1676416 Googly bear!
1683090 1684340 Come on.
1688470 1689929 Let's get out of here.
1690264 1693683 Please remain calm.<br />This is not a drill.
1696103 1698271 7835 in progress, please advise.
1698772 1701524 -Michael? Michael !<br />-Celia!
1701608 1703026 -Come with me.<br />-Stop pushing.
1703110 1705069 Get your hands off<br />my schmoopsie-pooh.
1706113 1707613 Ready for decontamination.
1708282 1711367 I don't think that date<br />could have gone any worse.
1717666 1721252 lf witnesses are to be believed,<br />there has been a child security breach
1721337 1723629 for the first time in monster history.
1723714 1727216 We neither confirm nor deny<br />the presence of a human child here.
1727301 1731512 Well. a kid flew right over me and<br />blasted a car with its laser vision.
1731597 1734807 l tried to run. but it picked me up<br />with its mind powers
1734892 1736184 and shook me like a doll.
1736268 1738478 It's true.<br />l saw the whole thing.
1738562 1743816 It is my professional opinion<br />that now is the time to panic.
1748489 1750490 It's coming. It's coming !
1751408 1752492 Boo!
1759166 1760833 No, no, no, no!
1761460 1762835 Come here, kid.
1765255 1767590 Don't touch those, you little. . .
1767674 1770051 Those were alphabetized.<br />It's OK.
1770135 1773554 As long as it doesn't come near us<br />we're gonna be OK.
1783315 1785441 You like this? Fetch.
1787778 1790696 Hey, hey. That's it.<br />No one touches Little Mikey.
1793409 1795368 Mike, give her the bear.
1796870 1798371 Oh, no!
1812886 1814804 Make it stop, Sulley.<br />Make it stop!
1814888 1817932 Here, look. See bear?<br />Nice bear.
1818475 1819559 Sulley!
1820769 1823521 Bear, he's a happy bear.
1823605 1826482 He's not crying, neither should you.<br />We'll be in trouble
1826567 1830486 'cause they're gonna find us,<br />so please stop crying now.
1830571 1833072 Good. Good, Sulley. Keep it up.<br />You're doing great.
1833157 1835116 He's a happy bear.<br />He has no. . .
1836660 1838870 -It touched me.<br />-Sulley, the bear!
1838954 1841330 The bear. Give her the. . .
1851842 1853634 What was that?
1853719 1858848 l have no idea, but it would be<br />really great if it didn't do it again.
1879786 1882330 How could I do this?<br />How could I be so stupid?
1882414 1885833 -This could destroy the company.<br />-Who cares about the company?
1885918 1889295 What about us?<br />That thing is a killing machine.
1890506 1893758 It's waiting for us to fall asleep<br />and then wham !
1894259 1897303 We're easy prey, my friend.<br />We're sitting targets.
1898013 1900223 OK, look, I think I have a plan here.
1900307 1903559 Using mainly spoons,<br />we dig a tunnel under the city
1903644 1905895 and release it into the wild.
1906271 1907480 Spoons.
1908649 1911901 That's it. I'm out of ideas.<br />Air balloon, too expensive.
1911985 1916113 Giant slingshot, too conspicuous.<br />Enormous wooden horse, too Greek.
1918659 1921744 No. Can't think. Can't think.
1922579 1924997 -Flatliner. Flatlining.<br />-Mike?
1925332 1927458 I think she's getting tired.
1927751 1931379 Well, then why don't you<br />find someplace for it to sleep
1931547 1933673 while I think of a plan !
1935676 1938511 Are you sleepy? Wanna sleep?
1938679 1940721 Is that what you want?
1954403 1957321 OK. I'll make a nice little area<br />for you to. . .
1957406 1961409 No. Hey, that's my bed.<br />You're gonna get your germs all over it.
1963745 1966497 Fine.<br />My chair's more comfortable anyway.
1968041 1969542 What?
1971712 1974380 It's just a closet.<br />Will you go to sleep?
1977801 1979594 Hey, that looks like Randall.
1980554 1982471 Randall's your monster.
1982931 1985558 You think he's gonna<br />come through the closet and scare you.
1985642 1987602 Oh, boy, how do I explain this?
1987686 1989061 It's empty.
1989354 1990563 See?
1991064 1992607 No monster in here.
1996278 1997612 Well, now there is.
1997696 1999780 But I'm not gonna scare you.
2000532 2001949 I'm off duty.
2005829 2006954 OK.
2007331 2011584 How about I sit here<br />until you fall asleep?
2013378 2015463 Go ahead. Go to sleep.
2016548 2019091 Now. Now go.
2020260 2024472 You go to sleep.
2058632 2062385 Mike, this might sound crazy,<br />but I don't think that kid's dangerous.
2062511 2065054 Really? Well, in that case,<br />let's keep it.
2065138 2067098 I always wanted a pet<br />that could kill me!
2067182 2069558 What if we just<br />put her back in her door?
2069643 2071352 -What?<br />-Mike, think about it.
2071436 2075064 We send her back,<br />everything goes back to normal.
2075315 2077900 Is that a joke?<br />Tell me you're joking.
2078443 2080569 Sulley, I think that given<br />the circumstance
2080654 2082446 I've been extremely forgiving till now.
2082531 2084031 But that is a horrible idea.
2084116 2086826 Are we gonna march in public<br />with that thing?
2087119 2089787 Then I guess we waltz<br />right up to the factory, right?
2091206 2094542 I can't believe we are waltzing<br />right up to the factory.
2094918 2097878 Sulley, a mop, a couple of lights<br />and some chair fabric
2097963 2100631 are not gonna fool anyone.<br />Think about names.
2100716 2103008 Loch Ness. Bigfoot.<br />The Abominable Snowman.
2103093 2105803 They all got one thing in common.<br />Banishment!
2105887 2108556 -We could be next.<br />-Don't panic. We can do this.
2108640 2110683 -How you doing, Frank?<br />-Hey, guys.
2110767 2113185 Everything's going to be OK.
2117941 2119859 Number one wants this<br />dusted for prints.
2119943 2122570 -Careful with that.<br />-l got a good view.
2122988 2124447 A little lower.
2124948 2126782 This was recovered at the scene.
2126867 2128743 -Don't panic.<br />-Don't tell me not to.
2128827 2130494 -Keep it together.<br />-It's not OK.
2131079 2132830 -Boo.<br />-Could be contaminated.
2132914 2135499 Gentlemen, safety<br />is our number-one concern.
2135584 2138502 If there's anything that. . .<br />Not now. I'm. . .
2138587 2140379 Oh, hello, little one.
2140464 2142757 -Where did you come from?<br />-Mr. Waternoose!
2142924 2144925 James, is this one yours?
2145010 2147178 Actually, that's my cousin's sister's
2147262 2149388 -daughter, sir.<br />-Yeah, it's. . .
2149556 2152600 Bring an Obscure Relative<br />to Work Day.
2153351 2155978 Must have missed the memo.<br />Well, listen, James,
2156062 2158397 why don't you stop by the simulator<br />after lunch
2158482 2161192 and give us that scare demonstration?
2161276 2163027 Yeah. Oh, sir. . .
2163111 2165488 -Mr. Waternoose?<br />-Yes, yes. I'm coming.
2165906 2167948 I'll see you this afternoon, James.
2168074 2171160 That is, if these gentlemen<br />haven't shut us down.
2171244 2172995 -Oh, boy.<br />-A scare demo.
2173079 2174914 That is great.<br />Why am I the last to know?
2174998 2178542 We could bring your cousin's sister's<br />daughter. She'll be a big hit.
2179461 2180753 Halt.
2182255 2183672 Hold him down.
2187719 2189220 Come on. The coast is clear.
2189638 2191847 OK. All we have to do<br />is get rid of that thing.
2191932 2193808 So wait here while I get its card.
2193892 2196852 She can't stay here.<br />This is the men's room.
2197646 2199605 That is the weirdest thing<br />you've ever said.
2200315 2203317 Look. It loves it here.<br />It's dancing with joy.
2204277 2206737 I'll be right back with its door key.
2208448 2212159 That's a cute little dance.<br />It almost looks like you've got to. . .
2227175 2228843 Are you done in there?
2231096 2232721 Sorry, sorry.
2245652 2247862 OK. You're finished now, right?
2248321 2249572 Hello?
2253451 2254577 Boo.
2265171 2266630 Where did she go?
2267966 2269508 Did she disappear?
2269843 2272261 Did she turn invisible?
2273013 2275347 I just have no idea.
2276349 2277683 Gotcha.
2278852 2279894 Boo.
2282689 2284565 Hey, you're good.
2290614 2293115 Be relaxed. Be relaxed. Be relaxed.
2293700 2297286 Roz, my tender oozing blossom.<br />You're looking fabulous today.
2297370 2300623 Is that a new haircut?<br />Tell me, it's a new haircut.
2301625 2304335 New makeup. You had a lift.<br />You had a tuck. You had something.
2304419 2308589 Something has been inserted in<br />your skin that makes you look like. . .
2310008 2314011 I need a favor. Randall was working<br />late last night on the scare floor.
2314095 2316847 I need the key<br />for the door he was using.
2316973 2319808 Well, isn't that nice?
2319893 2323812 But guess what? You didn't turn in<br />your paperwork last night.
2323897 2325898 He didn't. . . No paperwork?
2325982 2328734 This office is now closed.
2331154 2333489 Ready or not, here I come.
2333573 2334907 I'm getting warmer.
2334991 2336659 Any second now.
2336743 2340579 -Fee, fi, fo. . .<br />-What are you doing?
2341331 2342748 I'm looking for the kid.
2342832 2345459 -You lost it?<br />-No, no. She was just. . .
2347087 2348337 Here she is.
2348421 2350005 Hey. What's the matter?
2350090 2353258 -I already told your buddies. . .<br />-All right. Carry on.
2365814 2369566 Randall. Thank goodness.<br />What are we gonna do about the child?
2390454 2393748 It's on the front page.<br />The child. The one you were after.
2393833 2397210 Be quiet. Don't you think<br />I'm aware of the situation?
2397294 2399379 I was up all night trying to find it.
2399463 2403550 I did a calculation factoring in<br />the size of the sushi restaurant.
2403634 2405218 The child may have escaped !
2405302 2408137 Until we know for sure<br />we're gonna act like nothing happened.
2408889 2411703 Get the machine running.<br />I'll take care of the kid.
2411912 2414956 When I find whoever let it out,<br />they're dead.
2417334 2420587 Why are you still here?<br />Come on, go! Move! Now!
2420671 2421880 I'm not here.
2422798 2424132 They're gone.
2429180 2430847 This is bad, so very bad.
2430931 2432265 What were they talking about,<br />machine?
2432349 2433767 Who cares?
2434894 2437187 All we have to do<br />is call her door and send her home.
2437271 2439981 Right. We're just two regular Joes<br />on our way to work.
2440066 2441900 We will blend right in.
2442109 2444569 -Top of the morning.<br />-What's shakin', bacon?
2444653 2447030 Did you lose weight?<br />Or a limb?
2447198 2449449 -You have her card key, right?<br />-Of course.
2449533 2452243 I told you I'd get her card key.<br />I went and got it.
2452328 2454287 Now I have her card key.
2455414 2456748 OK. Here we go.
2457750 2461419 Take care of yourself. Try not to<br />run through any more closets.
2465049 2468009 -Mike, that's not her door.<br />-Of course it's her door.
2468094 2470595 No. Her door was white<br />and it had flowers on it.
2470679 2474265 It must have been dark last night<br />because this is its door.
2474934 2477602 Hey, you hear that?<br />Sounds like fun in there.
2477686 2480772 Send me a postcard, kid.<br />That's Mike Wazowski, care of
2480856 2483608 22 Mike Wazowski,<br />you-got-your-life-back Lane.
2484860 2486736 Very good. Now bon voyage.
2486821 2490490 Bye-bye. Look at the stick.<br />See the stick? Go get the stick.
2490783 2493952 -Go fetch.<br />-Mike, this isn't Boo's door.
2494245 2497664 -Boo? What's Boo?<br />-That's what I decided to call her.
2497790 2498790 There a problem?
2498874 2500333 Sulley, you're not supposed to name it.
2500417 2503211 Once you name it,<br />you start getting attached to it.
2503295 2506965 Now put that thing back<br />where it came from, or so help me. . .
2510678 2515431 Hey. We're rehearsing a scene for<br />the upcoming company play called. . .
2515641 2518685 Put That Thing Back<br />Where It Came From or So Help Me.
2519270 2520562 It's a musical.
2520646 2523231 Put that thing back<br />where it came from or so help me
2523315 2524524 So help me. so help me
2524608 2525692 And cut.
2526360 2529946 We're still working on it.<br />It's in progress, but we need ushers.
2530030 2533992 Sulley, I've had enough.<br />Say goodbye to. . . Where did it go?
2534118 2536578 -Where is she?<br />-She got away from you again?
2536662 2541166 Well, that is just. . .<br />Wait a minute. The sun is coming up.
2541250 2542876 This is perfect.
2542960 2544335 She's gone!
2545546 2547297 Where are you going?<br />Sulley, don't blow this.
2547381 2549174 We're so close to breaking the record.
2549258 2551926 Somebody will find the kid.<br />It'll be their problem.
2552011 2554179 She's out of our hair!
2555055 2558099 -What are you two doing?<br />-They're rehearsing a play.
2558184 2560768 She's out of our hair
2560853 2564772 Can it! So, what do you think<br />of that kid getting out, Sullivan?
2564857 2567066 -Pretty crazy?<br />-Oh, yeah, crazy.
2567151 2569777 Word is the kid's been traced<br />to this factory.
2569862 2572447 -You haven't seen anything?<br />-Well. . .
2572698 2574449 No. No way.
2574533 2578745 But if it was an inside job,<br />I'd put my money on Waxford.
2578829 2580788 -Waxford?<br />-The one at station six.
2580873 2583708 -He's got them shifty eyes.<br />-Hey, Waxford.
2584043 2586669 -Sulley!<br />-Michael Wazowski !
2589298 2593885 Last night was one of the worst nights<br />of my entire life, bar none!
2595638 2598681 -I thought you cared about me.<br />-Honey, please.
2598766 2601935 -I thought you liked sushi.<br />-Sushi ! Sushi !
2602019 2604771 You think this is about sushi?
2610401 2611485 Wazowski.
2611569 2613070 Michael !
2613154 2614154 Men.
2615865 2617491 Breathe. Keep breathing.
2629253 2631004 -Where's the kid?<br />-Kid?
2631089 2634257 -What kid?<br />-It's here in the factory, isn't it?
2635760 2638470 It never would have gotten out<br />if you hadn't been cheating last night.
2638554 2642658 Cheating? Cheating. Right.
2643035 2646162 OK. I think I know<br />how to make this all go away.
2646663 2650625 What happens when the whistle blows<br />in five minutes?
2651418 2654837 -I get a timeout?<br />-Everyone goes to lunch.
2655589 2659258 Which means the scare floor will be. . .
2660844 2662595 -Painted?<br />-Empty.
2662679 2664847 It'll be empty, you idiot.
2665140 2666474 You see that clock?
2666558 2670895 When the big hand is pointing up<br />and the little hand is pointing up,
2671021 2673439 the kid's door will be in my station.
2673565 2676526 But when the big hand points down,
2677069 2678653 the door will be gone.
2679154 2681822 You have until then to put the kid back.
2682533 2684158 Get the picture?
2695337 2696462 Boo!
2697214 2699507 -No.<br />-Hey. you. Halt.
2699883 2701050 He's the one.
2701134 2703636 -The one from the commercial.<br />-That's him.
2703720 2707181 -Can we get an autograph?<br />-Oh, sure. No problem.
2707266 2709642 Make that out to Stephanie.<br />my daughter.
2709726 2710893 Yes. Let's see.
2711436 2714480 "From your scary friend.<br />Best wishes. . ."
2714565 2718734 So, then I said, "If you talk to me<br />like that again, we're through".
2719236 2721654 -What'd she say?<br />-You know my mom.
2721738 2724574 -She sent me to my room.<br />-See you guys later. Take it easy.
2724658 2725992 Bottoms up.
2743427 2744552 Boo!
2749433 2750683 Hi.
2752561 2755104 Well, hello, there.<br />What's your name?
2755397 2757023 Mike Wazowski.
2795854 2797521 Sulley!
2797856 2799607 Oh, Sulley.
2800859 2802485 OK, Sulley, come on.
2803320 2805363 Hey! You guys seen Sulley anywhere?
2805447 2807698 -Nope, sorry.<br />-Sulley!
2807783 2810493 Boy, Wazowski<br />looks like he's in trouble.
2811953 2814747 231 9! We have a 231 9!
2814831 2817041 Oh, dear.
2817834 2820336 Sulley!
2823632 2826092 Sulley. Great news, pal.
2826176 2828636 I got us a way out of this mess,<br />but we gotta hurry.
2828720 2830179 Where is it?
2832015 2834266 Sull, that's a cube of garbage.
2836770 2839689 I can still hear her little voice.
2839981 2842108 -Mike Wazowski.<br />-I can hear it too.
2842192 2844944 -Mike Wazowski !<br />-How many kids you got in there?
2845028 2846612 Mike Wazowski !
2848156 2849824 -Kitty!<br />-Boo!
2851743 2855037 Boo, you're all right.<br />I was so worried. I was. . .
2855831 2859041 Don't you ever<br />run away from me again, young lady.
2859876 2862545 But I'm so glad you're safe.
2862963 2865756 My, what an affectionate father.
2865882 2868718 Actually, she's my cousin's sister's. . .
2869010 2871303 -That's enough. Let's go.<br />-Mike Wazowski.
2871388 2873889 Yeah. Step aside, kid.<br />We're in a. . .
2880939 2884358 -Will you stop making Boo laugh?<br />-I didn't. Come on.
2887904 2890448 I still don't understand.<br />You got Boo's door?
2890532 2892700 I'll explain later. Run.
2892784 2896537 Let's move, let's move. Come on.<br />Please be there. Please be there.
2896788 2899665 -There it is, just like Randall said.<br />-Randall?
2899791 2902168 Wait a minute. Boo, hey.
2902252 2905004 One, two, three, four,<br />get the kid through the door.
2905589 2909175 -The nightmare is over.<br />-It's OK, Boo. What's the matter?
2909259 2911719 -It's time to move.<br />-Mike, what are you thinking?
2911803 2914513 -Randall's after Boo.<br />-Who cares? Let's go.
2914598 2917600 -This is a limited-time offer.<br />-No. I don't like this.
2917684 2920269 Sulley, you wanted her door<br />and there it is.
2920353 2922855 -Now let's move.<br />-No, Mike.
2923565 2925691 You want me to prove<br />everything's on the up and up?
2925776 2927735 -He wants a door, I get a door.<br />-Wait.
2927819 2929904 Paranoid delusional furball.
2932115 2933365 Mike!
2992175 2994593 Hey, Sulley, where you been all day?
2994678 2996679 Sulley? Sulley!
3013238 3014989 Mike? Mike?
3015907 3017199 Where are you?
3017576 3018909 Are you in there?
3019536 3021036 Where are you, buddy?
3021580 3022830 Mike?
3023373 3024874 Where are you?
3035051 3036677 Boo, way to go.
3044561 3046020 It's OK.
3064122 3066749 Randall, did you have to. . .
3075759 3079053 -Yes! I got the kid.<br />-Oh, huzzah !
3079137 3083098 -Great news. Not that I was concerned.<br />-Get over here and help me.
3083683 3086268 Come on, while we're young here,<br />Fungus.
3090357 3092942 The kid needs to take off a few pounds.
3097280 3100366 Wazowski ! Where is it,<br />you little one-eyed cretin?
3100450 3103452 It's cretin. If you're gonna<br />threaten me, do it properly.
3103536 3105704 Second, you're nuts if you think<br />kidnapping me
3105789 3107623 is gonna help you cheat!
3110210 3113420 You still think this is about<br />that stupid scare record?
3113505 3115089 Well, I did.
3115173 3120010 Right up until you chuckled like that.<br />Now I think I should get out of here.
3120720 3123847 I'm about to revolutionize<br />the scaring industry.
3123932 3126892 When I do,<br />even the great James P. Sullivan
3126977 3128727 is gonna be working for me.
3128812 3131897 Well, somebody's certainly<br />been a busy bee.
3131982 3135401 First I need to know where the kid is<br />and you're gonna tell me.
3135485 3137277 -I don't know.<br />-Sure.
3137362 3139446 I don't. I don't.
3141866 3144743 What's that? Wait.<br />Wait, wait, wait, wait.
3145495 3147496 Come on. No, no.<br />Come on. Hey, hey.
3147580 3149540 Hey, hey. This thing is moving.
3151167 3154503 I don't like big moving things<br />that are moving towards me.
3154796 3156213 No. Come on. Hey!
3156506 3161176 -Randall !<br />-Say hello to the scream extractor.
3161886 3163012 Hello.
3163263 3166348 Where you going?<br />We'll talk. We'll have a latte.
3166558 3169351 Come on. We can talk about this.
3173523 3175190 What is that thing?
3175608 3177901 Wait, wait, wait.<br />No, no, no.
3177986 3179778 No. Come on.
3181364 3184116 Help. Help! Help, help!
3191332 3193500 For. . . What did you do wrong this time?
3193585 3196879 -I don't know. I calibrated the. . .<br />-Go check the machine.
3196963 3199798 There must be something wrong<br />with the scream intake valve.
3220403 3223572 Fungus? Fungus? You like cars?
3224074 3228410 I got a really nice car. If you<br />let me go, I'll give you a ride
3228495 3230871 in the car.<br />Please, Fungus.
3230955 3233999 I'm sorry, Wazowski,<br />but Randall said I'm not allowed
3234084 3237002 to fraternize with victims<br />of his evil plot.
3249265 3251725 What happened?<br />Where's Wazowski?
3254938 3256605 Where is he?
3262403 3265072 -Come on.<br />-This is crazy. He's gonna kill us.
3265156 3266865 That could be contaminated.
3266950 3268867 We gotta get out of here now!
3268952 3272538 We could start a new life far away.<br />Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.
3272622 3274623 Goodbye, Mr. Waternoose.
3274707 3277209 -No, Mike, wait.<br />-Hey, what are you doing?
3277293 3281380 -Follow me. I have an idea.<br />-No, no, no, no, no.
3281965 3285217 -Simulation terminated.<br />-No, no, no, no, no.
3285301 3289263 What was that? You're trying<br />to scare the kid, not lull it to sleep.
3289347 3292224 I was going for a snake/ninja approach
3292308 3294268 with a little hissing.
3295228 3299022 How many times do I have to tell you?<br />It's all about presence.
3299107 3302442 -About how you enter the room.<br />-Mr. Waternoose!
3302527 3304403 James, perfect timing.
3304487 3306405 No, no, sir. You don't understand.
3306489 3309116 -Show these monsters how it's done.<br />-I can't.
3309200 3311869 -Sir, you have to listen to me.<br />-Pay attention.
3311953 3314454 You're about to see<br />the best in the business.
3314539 3317249 -Reset the simulator.<br />-But sir!
3317333 3319209 -Good night, sweetheart.<br />-'Night, Mom.
3319586 3321253 -Kitty!<br />-No, Boo, no!
3321337 3325007 -Give us a big loud roar.<br />-There's no time for this!
3325091 3327843 -What are you waiting for? Roar.<br />-But, sir. . .
3327927 3329469 Roar!
3340190 3343233 Well done. Well done, James.
3343526 3344776 -Boo?<br />-All right, gentlemen.
3344861 3348197 -Right this way.<br />-I hope you've learned a lesson today.
3352702 3359541 Boo.
3364380 3366465 Boo, it's me.
3369219 3371637 -The child !<br />-Sir, she isn't toxic.
3371721 3374348 -It sounds crazy, but trust me.<br />-Boo?
3374849 3376558 No, no, no, no, it's OK.
3376643 3378268 I was just. . . No.
3378353 3382397 No, don't be scared.<br />That wasn't real.
3382482 3385400 It's just a. . . I was just. . .
3399082 3402417 -Boo.<br />-. . .test it out on that sweet girl.
3403086 3405545 -Boo.<br />-. . .have her, he is trying to kill us.
3405672 3407714 -This is Randall's fault.<br />-Randall?
3407799 3411343 We can take you to his secret lab<br />in this factory.
3411427 3415264 How could this happen?<br />How could this happen?
3416307 3418433 Does anyone else know about this?
3418518 3419935 -No, sir.<br />-Good.
3420395 3423605 This company can't afford<br />any more bad publicity.
3423940 3426400 Now, before we do anything else,
3426484 3429611 let's take care of the child.
3433950 3436326 I never thought<br />things would come to this.
3436744 3438453 Not in my factory.
3439872 3442874 I'm sorry you boys got mixed up in this.
3442959 3444835 Especially you, James.
3444919 3447921 But now we can<br />set everything straight again.
3448423 3449548 For the good of the company.
3454053 3455887 Sir? That's not her door.
3455972 3457806 I know, I know.
3460893 3462394 It's yours.
3466774 3467899 No!
3470278 3472237 Boo!
3477910 3482122 No! No! No, no, no, no!
3483624 3486209 It's too late.<br />We're banished, genius!
3486294 3488253 We're in the human world.
3488338 3491548 What a great idea,<br />going to your old pal Waternoose.
3491674 3493925 Too bad he was in on the whole thing.
3494010 3496428 All you had to do was listen to me.
3496512 3500682 Just once!<br />But you didn't, did you?
3500808 3503101 You're still not listening !
3509942 3511360 Take that!
3516908 3519493 Welcome to the Himalayas.
3522747 3525707 Abominable. Can you believe that?
3525792 3527626 Do I look abominable to you?
3527794 3530003 Why can't they call me<br />the Adorable Snowman
3530088 3533131 or the Agreeable Snowman,<br />for crying out loud?
3533341 3535967 I'm a nice guy.<br />Snow cone?
3536928 3539596 No, don't worry. It's lemon.
3540515 3543058 How about you, big fella?<br />Snow cone?
3545728 3548522 Did you see the way she looked at me?
3551526 3555112 Poor guy. I understand.<br />It ain't easy being banished.
3555405 3556822 Take my buddy, Bigfoot.
3556906 3561159 When he was banished, he fashioned<br />an enormous diaper out of poison ivy.
3561411 3563245 Wore it on his head like a tiara.
3563329 3567207 Called himself King Itchy.<br />It won't be so hard for you guys.
3567333 3568708 How lucky can you get?
3568793 3572212 -Banished with your best friend.<br />-He is not my friend.
3572422 3576216 I just assumed you were buddies.<br />When I saw you in the snow hugging. . .
3576300 3579344 Look at that big jerk.<br />Ruined my life. And for what?
3579429 3580679 A stupid kid !
3580763 3584015 Because of you I am now stuck<br />in this frozen wasteland.
3584100 3587394 Wasteland?<br />I think you mean wonderland.
3587478 3589938 How about all this fabulous snow?
3590440 3592649 And wait till you see<br />the local village.
3592733 3596695 Cutest thing in the world.<br />I haven't mentioned the free yaks' milk.
3597363 3599364 -What did you say?<br />-Yaks' milk.
3599449 3601533 Milking a yak ain't exactly a picnic.
3601617 3604035 Once you pick the hairs out<br />it's nutritious.
3604120 3606538 No, about a village.<br />Are there kids in it?
3606622 3609875 Kids? Sure. Tough kids, sissy kids,<br />kids who climb on rocks.
3609959 3612419 -Where is it?<br />-At the bottom of the mountain.
3612503 3615297 -A three-day hike.<br />-Three days?
3615381 3617382 We need to get there now.
3627810 3629603 You wanna go to the village?
3629687 3633815 Rule number one out here,<br />always. . . No.
3634400 3636401 Never go out in a blizzard.
3636527 3638820 We need to get to Boo.
3640990 3642949 Boo? What about us?
3644035 3646995 Ever since the kid came in,<br />you've ignored everything I've said,
3647079 3652250 and now look where we are!<br />We were about to break the record.
3652335 3655795 -We would have had it made.<br />-None of that matters now.
3656506 3658840 None of it matters?<br />Wait a second.
3659091 3661092 None of it matters?
3663471 3666014 OK. No, good. Great.
3666766 3669226 So now the truth comes out, doesn't it?
3670853 3674147 Would you look at that?<br />We're out of snow cones.
3674232 3677025 Let me just go outside<br />and make some more.
3678444 3681530 Sulley, what about everything<br />we ever worked for?
3682406 3684157 Does that matter?
3685535 3687035 What about Celia?
3687161 3690372 I am never. . .<br />Never gonna see her again.
3691332 3693124 Doesn't that matter?
3698256 3699673 And what about me?
3700550 3703051 I'm your pal. I'm your best friend.
3704220 3705762 Don't I matter?
3708933 3710559 I'm sorry, Mike.
3710768 3712727 I'm sorry we're stuck out here.
3713229 3715272 I didn't mean for this to happen.
3715648 3717524 But Boo's in trouble.
3717692 3720777 I think there might be<br />a way to save her if we can just get. . .
3720861 3723363 We? Whoa. We?
3723573 3726992 No. There's no "we" this time, pal.
3727368 3730787 If you want to go out there<br />and freeze to death,
3731330 3732914 you be my guest.
3733916 3736042 Because you're on your own.
3773122 3775290 Hey, I got more snow cones!
3822505 3825590 Come on, George.<br />I know you can do this.
3825675 3827842 I picked out an easy door for you.
3828010 3831096 In Nepal. Nice, quiet Nepal.
3831180 3834265 You know, you're right.<br />Here. Take this.
3834350 3836142 Go get 'em, Georgie.
3836268 3837727 Look out. Coming through.
3837812 3840563 -Sorry, George.<br />-Hey, you can't just. . .
3841399 3842941 Twenty-three. . .
3848364 3850031 Out of the way!
3855371 3858456 Finally. I never should have<br />trusted you with this.
3858541 3861543 Because of you,<br />I had to banish my top scarer.
3861627 3863795 With this machine,<br />we won't need scarers.
3863879 3866047 Sullivan got what he deserved.
3866132 3869217 Sullivan was twice the scarer<br />you will ever be.
3883149 3884441 Kitty!
3891365 3893116 -Kitty!<br />-Sullivan?
3899457 3901583 -Kitty!<br />-Sorry, Boo.
3901792 3903418 Stop him !
3904044 3905754 Let's get you home.
3909383 3910759 Finish him off!
3918350 3922187 You don't know how long<br />I've wanted to do that, Sullivan.
3934742 3935784 Mike?
3935868 3938369 -It's not that I don't care.<br />-Mike, you don't understand.
3938454 3940580 Yes, I do.<br />I was just mad, that's all.
3940664 3945001 I needed some time to think, but<br />you shouldn't have left me out there.
3945628 3948046 -I'm being attacked.<br />-I'm not attacking you.
3948130 3951633 I'm trying to be honest. Hear me out.<br />You and I are a team.
3951717 3954260 Nothing is more important<br />than our friendship.
3954345 3956471 I know. He's too sensitive.
3958891 3961768 Come on, pal.<br />If you start crying, I'm gonna cry.
3961852 3964020 And I'll never get through this.
3964104 3967148 I'm sorry I wasn't there for you,<br />but I am now.
3967233 3971653 Sulley, I am baring my soul here.<br />The least you can do is pay attention.
3975825 3977909 Look at that. It's Randall.
3979495 3980703 Come on.
3981330 3983957 Get up. There can't be any witnesses.
3984041 3985083 There won't be.
3985709 3987377 I'm glad you came back, Mike.
3987461 3990713 Somebody's gotta take care of you,<br />you big hairball.
3994051 3996427 -Schmoopsie-pooh, I can't talk.<br />-Come on.
3996512 4001015 Michael, if you don't tell me what's<br />going on right now, we are through !
4001517 4002559 Here's the truth.
4002643 4006896 The kid? Sulley let her in. We tried to<br />send her back, Waternoose had a plot,
4006981 4009357 and now Randall's trying to kill us!
4009441 4012819 You expect me to believe<br />that pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?
4012903 4014487 Mike Wazowski.
4015239 4017448 I love you, schmoopsie-pooh !
4017533 4020618 -Hey!<br />-Idiots.
4021620 4023288 Look out. Coming through.
4023372 4026124 Make way. Move it.<br />Hurry up, hurry up.
4027710 4030169 -There they are.<br />-Attention. employees.
4030254 4034215 Randall Boggs has just broken<br />the all-time scare record.
4034884 4037385 No, I didn't.<br />Get out of my way.
4038012 4039888 Go get 'em, googly bear.
4041390 4042473 There it is.
4042558 4045268 Get off my tail. Let go.
4049064 4050565 -What are you doing?<br />-Grab on, Mike.
4050649 4053610 Are you out of your mind?
4063495 4066664 -Sulley, what are we doing?<br />-Get Boo's door and find a station.
4066749 4069250 What a plan.<br />Simple, yet insane.
4083098 4084641 -Whoa.<br />-Oh, boy.
4085100 4086768 Hold on !
4095486 4097111 Don't look down !
4112962 4114712 I'm gonna be sick.
4118926 4120218 Oh, no.
4124181 4125431 No!
4126809 4128893 -Boo's door.<br />-There it is.
4129103 4131688 How are we supposed to get to it now?
4134984 4136609 It's a dead end, Sulley.
4138320 4139821 -There he is.<br />-Make her laugh.
4139905 4141656 -Sulley!<br />-Just do it!
4151250 4153418 -Get it open.<br />-Here he comes.
4153502 4155169 Give me that kid.
4160217 4164178 -Why couldn't we get banished here?<br />-We gotta find another door.
4169518 4171310 Look! Boo's door.
4175941 4178776 -There he is. Hurry up!<br />-Give me your hand.
4185701 4188327 -Come on, it slides.<br />-Right. Right.
4192041 4194042 Jump. I'm right behind you.
4198714 4200173 Come on.
4202134 4203593 Hurry up. Keep moving !
4203677 4205386 Get inside.
4206263 4207930 That was weird.
4208432 4209682 Mike?
4209767 4212018 -Sorry, buddy.<br />-OK.
4219860 4221986 I hope that hurt, lizard boy.
4226784 4228743 Great job, buddy. We lost him.
4228911 4230119 Boo!
4231580 4232830 No!
4234917 4237001 Nice working with you.
4237086 4238503 -Get it open !<br />-I'm trying !
4238587 4241255 -Open the door!<br />-Come on, get in here.
4250891 4252100 Boo!
4255521 4257063 There they are!
4260859 4263444 Sulley, what are you doing?<br />Sulley!
4267658 4270535 -Looks like we caught the express.<br />-Do you see them?
4270619 4272328 Straight ahead.
4296061 4297562 -Kitty.<br />-Boo.
4304319 4307738 Look at everybody's<br />favorite scarer now.
4307823 4310950 You stupid, pathetic waste.
4313954 4318166 You've been number one for too long,<br />Sullivan. Now your time is up.
4319001 4323588 And don't worry.<br />I'll take good care of the kid.
4323714 4324881 No!
4346528 4348905 She's not scared of you anymore.
4350199 4352491 Looks like you're out of a job.
4353535 4356454 OK, over the plate.<br />Let's see the old stuff.
4356538 4358456 Chuck him, baby.
4358540 4362501 Here's the pitch and he is out of here.
4363253 4366631 -Mama, another gator got in the house.<br />-Another gator?
4366715 4368841 Give me that shovel. There!
4369426 4371552 Get him, Mama. Get that gator.
4373513 4376599 -Care to do the honors, Mikey?<br />-With pleasure.
4386193 4388236 That's right, Boo. You did it.
4388320 4389946 You beat him.
4390155 4391572 Come on.
4394576 4396035 OK, Boo, it's time to go home.
4396119 4399080 Take care of yourself<br />and be a good girl, OK?
4400332 4403084 -Oh, no.<br />-The power's out. Make her laugh.
4403168 4406254 I got a move here<br />that'll bring down the house.
4410133 4412343 -Sorry. She didn't see that.<br />-What?
4412427 4415554 What, did you forget to check<br />if her hood was up, you big dope?
4415639 4418641 Uncle Mike, try not to yell<br />in front of her.
4418767 4421435 -You know we need her to laugh.<br />-Right.
4421770 4424021 Hey, Boo. Just kidding. Look.
4424564 4426565 Funny, right? See, with the. . .
4426650 4430111 These are the jokes, kid.<br />What's happening?
4430988 4432113 Hold on.
4432990 4435700 When the door lands in the station,<br />cut the power.
4435784 4440162 You'll have the child and the criminals<br />responsible for this whole mess.
4441623 4444625 Great. A welcoming committee.<br />What are we gonna do?
4457180 4461684 This is the CDA. Come out slowly<br />with the child in plain sight.
4461768 4464395 OK, OK, you got us.
4464688 4466314 Here we are. Here's the kid.
4466398 4470651 I'll cooperate, but before you<br />take us away, I have one thing to say.
4471862 4473946 -Catch.<br />-231 9.
4474489 4476574 We have a toxic projectile.
4477284 4480494 -After the suspect.<br />-Stop him !
4483749 4486208 -Come on.<br />-Don't let them get away.
4488587 4491130 Wait. Come back.<br />He has the child.
4496762 4498888 Sullivan. Sullivan !
4498972 4502683 Give me the child. Give her to me!
4511693 4514445 Open this door.<br />Open this door!
4520369 4521619 Stop it.
4521870 4523329 Don't do it.
4524790 4527041 -Come on.<br />-Don't go in that room.
4531046 4533964 I think we stopped him, Boo.<br />You're safe now.
4534049 4535966 You be a good girl, OK?
4537219 4540888 -This has gone far enough, James.<br />-She's home. Leave her alone.
4540972 4543557 I can't do that. She's seen too much.
4543725 4546352 -You both have.<br />-It doesn't have to be this way.
4546436 4549188 I have no choice. Times have changed.
4549272 4552316 -Scaring isn't enough anymore.<br />-But kidnapping?
4552401 4555736 I'll kidnap 1 ,000 children<br />before I let the company die.
4555821 4559115 And I'll silence anyone<br />who gets in my way!
4560534 4561951 No!
4562035 4563494 -Night, Mom.<br />-Night, sweetheart.
4563578 4565121 -Night, Mom.<br />-What is this?
4565205 4568833 Simulation terminated.<br />Simulation terminated.
4569292 4572002 Well, I don't know<br />about the rest of you guys,
4572087 4574505 but I spotted several big mistakes.
4574589 4576507 But how did. . .
4576591 4580010 You know what? Let's watch<br />my favorite part again. Shall we?
4580095 4591313 l'll kidnap 1 .000 children<br />before l let this company die.
4591982 4593149 -Come with us.<br />-What are you doing?
4593233 4595526 Take your hands off.<br />You can't arrest me.
4595610 4599113 I hope you're happy, Sullivan.<br />You destroyed this company.
4599197 4603492 Monsters, Incorporated is dead !<br />Where will everyone get their scream?
4603743 4607830 The energy crisis will only get worse<br />because of you !
4612711 4615254 Stay where you are.<br />Number one wants to talk to you.
4615464 4616922 Attention.
4623930 4625473 Hello, boys.
4625807 4626974 -Roz?<br />-Roz?
4628226 4632897 Two and a half years of<br />undercover work were almost wasted
4632981 4635941 when you intercepted that child,<br />Mr. Sullivan.
4636776 4638611 Of course, without your help,
4638695 4642948 I never would have known that<br />this went all the way up to Waternoose.
4646912 4649330 Now, about the girl.
4649998 4652291 I just want to send her home.
4653168 4654502 Very good.
4655212 4658130 -Bring me a door shredder.<br />-What? You mean. . .
4658215 4660508 You mean I can't see her again?
4660926 4663135 That's the way it has to be.
4664638 4666430 I'll give you five minutes.
4678193 4680694 -Well, so long, kid.<br />-Mike Wazowski.
4681404 4682530 Yeah.
4683031 4684198 Boo.
4684282 4685658 It's been fun.
4688411 4690579 Go ahead. Go grow up.
4710725 4712226 But, Boo. . .
4713228 4714353 Boo.
4715146 4717273 Look at that. You know. . .
4718316 4720067 That's cute. Yeah.
4721444 4722653 Boo. . .

4737002 4739336 Oh. he's a happy bear
4745427 4748721 Nothing's coming out of your closet<br />to scare you anymore, right?
4749472 4750764 Yeah.
4752809 4754310 Goodbye, Boo.
4755437 4756604 Kitty.
4757939 4759607 Kitty has to go.
4800273 4801482 Boo.
4804486 4805694 Kitty?
4814954 4817998 None of this ever happened,<br />gentlemen.
4819209 4823003 And I don't want to see<br />any paperwork on this.
4845068 4846568 Take him away.
4849614 4851782 I bet we get the rest of the day off.
4851866 4855035 You idiot.<br />They're gonna shut down the factory.
4857997 4860624 When that wall went up, you should<br />have seen Waternoose's face.
4861209 4863210 I hope we get a copy of that tape.
4863461 4864670 Are you all right?
4865088 4866922 Come on, pal.<br />Cheer up. We did it!
4867006 4868465 We got Boo home.
4868550 4871176 Sure, we put the factory<br />in the toilet and
4871261 4873429 hundreds of people<br />will be out of work.
4873513 4876390 Not to mention the mob that will<br />come after us when there's no power,
4876474 4879226 but at least we had some laughs, right?
4883189 4884440 Laughs.

4951883 4954218 Remember to tip your waitresses.
4958056 4961225 Great job, Mikey. You filled your quota<br />on the first kid of the day.
4961309 4964394 Not bad. Only somebody<br />with perfect comedic timing
4964479 4967231 could produce this much energy<br />in one shot.
4967357 4970234 And the fact that laughter<br />is ten times more powerful than scream
4970318 4971902 had nothing to do with it?
4971986 4975656 Googly bear, come here, you.
4975949 4978283 -Schmoopsie-pooh !<br />-Googly.
4980954 4984331 Girls, stop, stop, stop.
4984958 4987274 Michael, you're such a charmer.
4987358 4989859 -Did you bring the magazine?<br />-A whole box.
4989944 4991653 Let me see it!
4991904 4993822 Sulley and I made the cover, right?
4995324 4997117 I don't believe it!

4999328 5002872 I'm on the cover of a magazine!
5008998 5010874 This is great.
5038528 5040529 -Hey, Sulley.<br />-Hey, Mike.
5040613 5043240 -I was. . .<br />-There's something I want to show you.

5051165 5052207 -Come on.<br />-Mike!

5054961 5056086 OK, stop.

5060883 5063677 Mike, is that. . .
5063886 5065721 Sorry it took so long, pal.
5065805 5068432 There was a lot of wood to go through.
5068725 5071435 It only works if you have every piece.
5099338 5100505 Boo?
