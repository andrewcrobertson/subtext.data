2573788 2576356 Bastard murders you<br />and your reputation.
2576443 2579533 That guy pushes drops.<br />On the east end.
2581143 2582797 I don't get it.
2582884 2584886 Why would Pete get involved<br />in something like this?
2585844 2587802 Looks like he got greedy.
2587889 2589412 You kidding me?
2589499 2591719 After everything we did<br />to take down the Maronis?
2591806 2593242 We busted<br />their entire operation,
2593329 2595201 then he caves<br />to some lowlife dealer?
2595288 2597333 Maybe he's not<br />who you thought.
2598900 2600902 You make it sound<br />like he had it coming.
2603209 2604602 He was a cop.
2605994 2607256 Crossed a line.

2640246 2643858 Want to know my name?<br />Just look inside and see."
2651039 2654216 "Follow the maze<br />until you find the rat.
2654303 2657872 Bring him into the light,<br />and you'll find where I'm at."
2657959 2660353 The hell is that?
2660440 2663573 "Bring him into the light"?<br />"Find the rat"?
2664705 2666185 I don't know.
2667099 2668274 [Martinez] Lieutenant.
2668361 2669797 They're coming back.
2669884 2671364 [Gordon] We got<br />to get out of here.
2671451 2673409 [eerie music continues]
2675411 2676630 Come on.
2681809 2682767 [Selina] Ow.
2684333 2685813 I don't know<br />about these things.
2685900 2689077 I need to see in there,<br />this hunting ground.
2693255 2695736 Hey, why am I starting to feel<br />like a fish on a hook?
2697651 2699087 I'm just looking for Annika.
2703396 2706051 Boy, you're a real sweetheart.
2706138 2707443 You really don't care<br />what happens to me
2707530 2708662 in there tonight, do you?
2710185 2712144 [gentle music playing]
2718324 2719499 Look at me.
2729161 2731293 Looks good. Here.

2774467 2776425 I got you. Can you hear me?
2777383 2778384 Yeah.
2787045 2788568 Hey, where you goin'?
2788655 2790483 Hospitality.
2790570 2792006 [Batman] <i>That's one of the guys</i>

2803365 2805454 "Kenzie, William."
2805541 2806934 He's an off-duty cop.
2808893 2810764 Are you sure no one can see<br />these things in my eyes?
2810851 2812853 Don't worry. I'm watching you.
2813985 2816509 [sighs]
2816596 2818990 -[techno music playing]<br />-[indistinct chatter]
2824822 2826388 [computer trilling<br />rhythmically]
2829435 2832655 Don't look away.<br />I need time to make IDs.
2832742 2833743 Great.
2841055 2842143 These guys<br />have a little problem
2842230 2843449 with eye contact, don't they?
2843536 2844972 Feels good, doesn't it?
2845059 2847235 [man] Yeah, baby.<br />Feels real good.
2853328 2854939 [Selina] <i>Jesus,</i><br /><i>I hate dropheads.</i>
2855026 2856070 [Batman] Really?
2856157 2857637 'Cause when I first saw you,
2857724 2859117 it looked like you were<br />dealing for Penguin.
2859204 2859813 You don't know<br />what you're talking about.
2859900 2861293 Can we not...
2861380 2863077 Can we not do this right now?
2865036 2866689 Wait. Who was that?
2866776 2867777 Oh, I saw him.
2867865 2869518 [Batman] <i>Look back.</i>
2869605 2870955 If I look back, it's gonna be<br />a whole can of worms.
2871042 2872217 I need to see his face.
2873871 2875350 [sighs] Jesus.
2883402 2884533 That's the DA.
2884620 2885883 <i>Gil Colson.</i>
2885970 2887536 And he's coming over.<br />You happy?
2887623 2888711 [Batman] <i>Talk to him.</i>
2891845 2892933 Hey. How you doing?
2893020 2894979 -Hi.<br />-I'm Gil.
2896241 2899026 -Hey, aren't you the DA?<br />-Yeah.
2899113 2901289 Wow. [chuckles]<br />I've seen you on TV.
2901376 2903117 Is that right?
2903204 2906294 I haven't seen you<br />around here before.
2906381 2908427 It's a hell of a time<br />to be the new girl
2908514 2911038 'cause people<br />are all a little on edge.
2911125 2912605 [Selina] <i>Oh, honey,</i><br /><i>I live on the edge.</i>
2912692 2913954 -[Gil] <i>Is that right?</i><br />-[Selina chuckles]
2914041 2915477 [Gil chuckles] <i>I like that.</i>
2915564 2916696 Do you want to come over?
2916783 2917784 Sure.
2920830 2922397 -[Gil] <i>This is Travis.</i><br /><i>-Hey.</i>
2922484 2923877 [Gil] <i>You wanna take a seat</i><br /><i>over there?</i>
2923964 2925792 <i>-Richie, Glen.</i><br />-[Richie] <i>Hey.</i>
2927272 2928795 That's half the DA's office.
2928882 2930144 [Gil] <i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>
2930231 2931841 -Hi.<br />-That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
2931929 2933191 she's just taking a break.
2933278 2935410 Drowning our sorrows.
2935497 2936977 <i>You want a drop?</i>
2937064 2938892 [Selina] <i>Uh, no, I'm good.</i><br /><i>But you enjoy.</i>
2938979 2940763 [music continues on speakers]
2940850 2942417 <i>Hope you don't mind.</i>
2942504 2943810 <i>I got a lot on my shoulders</i>
2943897 2944985 <i>with that psycho</i><br /><i>running around.</i>
2945072 2946073 He's wasted.
2946160 2947814 No shit.
2947901 2950251 [chuckles] <i>I like this girl.</i>
2950338 2951861 Oh, hey, I like you, too!
2955430 2957302 <i>I mean, this Riddler,</i>
2957389 2958738 <i>he's going after the most</i><br /><i>powerful people in the city.</i>
2958825 2960218 <i>He knows so much.</i>
2960305 2961567 [Travis] <i>He doesn't</i><br /><i>know shit, man.</i>
2961654 2962960 [Gil] <i>What are you</i><br /><i>talking about?</i>
2963047 2964396 <i>Yeah, he does!</i><br /><i>What about that rat...</i>
2964483 2966050 [Richie] <i>Hey, hey,</i><br /><i>Gil, come on.</i>
2966137 2967703 -Hey. The rat.<br />-[Richie] <i>Think maybe you had</i>
2967790 2968661 <i>-a little too much. Slow down.</i><br />-Ask him about the rat.
2970706 2972491 [Selina] <i>Hey,</i><br /><i>what's this about a rat?</i>
2975929 2977452 [inhales deeply]
2982849 2984851 <i>I mean,</i>
2984938 2989029 <i>there was a rat.</i><br /><i>We had an informant.</i>
2989116 2991553 <i>We had big-time information</i><br /><i>on Salvatore Maroni.</i>
2991640 2993251 <i>That's how we got him out of</i><br /><i>the drops business.</i>
2993338 2994948 He's talking about<br />the Maroni case.
2995035 2998734 <i>But if this guy knows,</i><br /><i>it's gonna come out.</i>
2998821 3000301 <i>And when it does,</i>
3000388 3001259 <i>this whole city's</i><br /><i>gonna come apart.</i>
3001346 3003174 <i>Okay, I don't wanna hear this.</i>
3003261 3004784 <i>This is</i><br /><i>the kind of pillow talk</i>
3004871 3006003 <i>that got that Russian girl</i><br /><i>disappeared.</i>
3006090 3008788 What do you know about that?
3008875 3011138 <i>-Does anybody want a drink?</i><br />-[Gil] <i>I want a drink.</i>
3011225 3012444 Keep him talking.
3015621 3017753 <i>-Wait, where are you going?</i><br />-She knows Annika.
3017840 3019277 No, stay on the DA.
3019364 3021235 I told you<br />I'm looking for my friend.
3023237 3024412 Where's Annika?
3024499 3025848 Out of my face.<br />I don't know you.
3025935 3027154 Yeah, but you know her.<br />Who took her?
3027241 3028677 What have you heard?<br />Is she okay?
3028764 3029809 <i>Jesus Christ,</i><br /><i>keep your voice down.</i>
3029896 3031245 <i>What, you got a death wish?</i>
3031332 3033204 [man] Hey,<br />what's the problem, ladies?
3033291 3036163 [Carla] There's no problem.<br />It's just girl talk.
3036250 3037730 <i>Let's keep it festive</i><br /><i>down here, all right?</i>
3037817 3038861 [Carla] <i>Sure thing, Oz.</i>
3043605 3044650 <i>Hey.</i>
3045259 3047435 Hey.
3047522 3050656 Been a long time<br />since I seen you down here.
3051961 3053137 How you been?
3055530 3057184 Yeah, I've been okay.
3058577 3059926 <i>I was just, um...</i>
3062015 3063756 I was just headed back<br />upstairs.
3063843 3065540 Mm. Well,
3066672 3068282 <i>don't be a stranger.</i>
3082427 3084777 -You know Carmine Falcone.<br />-I told you it's a mob spot.
3084864 3086431 You didn't tell me you had<br />a relationship with him.
3086518 3088302 <i>I don't have a relationship</i><br /><i>with him, okay?</i>
3088389 3089825 Well, that's not<br />what it looked like.
3089912 3091697 <i>-Forget it.</i><br />-Wait, what are you doing?
3091784 3092611 [line breaking up] <i>Listen,</i><br /><i>I can't do this anymore.</i>
3092698 3093916 No! No!
3094003 3095353 [static buzzes, stream stops]
3098486 3099487 [Selina] Taxi!
3099574 3101533 [heavy breathing]
3103448 3104405 [Gil] Hey!
3106146 3107234 I lost you in there.
3107321 3108366 Yeah, I gotta go.
3109280 3111325 Oh, you need a ride?
3111412 3112718 That's me right there.
3112805 3115112 [eerie music playing]
3118724 3119812 Taxi!
3119899 3121030 I'm good.
3122989 3124382 I hope, uh...
3129213 3130562 -I'll see you around.<br />-[car door closes]

3275968 3277056 [switch clicks]
3279058 3280973 [Batman] What do you know<br />about a confidential informant
3281060 3282279 in the Maroni case?
3285760 3288110 Yeah, sure, there was.
3288197 3290852 That's the rat<br />we're looking for.
3290939 3293333 Somehow<br />Riddler knows who he is.
3293420 3296467 If we find the rat,<br />maybe it'll lead us to him.
3296554 3298120 Where are you getting this?
3298207 3300819 I have a source<br />who spoke to the DA tonight.
3301733 3304039 Gil's very nervous.
3304126 3306651 I think the killer's targeting<br />people close to that case.
3306738 3308609 I worked that case.
3308696 3311960 -Riddler's not after you.<br />-How do you know?
3312047 3313397 You're not corrupt.
3314485 3316008 Colson's dirty?
3321927 3324016 Maybe I, uh...
3324103 3327367 I go after him. Lean on him<br />to give up the rat.
3327454 3328847 It's too dangerous.
3328934 3331458 They made a secret deal<br />with this guy.
3331545 3333373 Who knows how many people<br />it touches.
3333460 3337812 Politicians. Police.<br />The courts.
3337899 3339945 It could tear<br />the whole city apart.
3340032 3342034 [Gordon] Jesus,<br />this is a powder keg.
3343688 3346255 [Batman]<br />And Riddler's the match.
3346343 3347735 [Batman on video]<br /><i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>
3347822 3349781 [Selina] <i>I told you</i><br /><i>it's a mob spot.</i>

3367015 3368974 She a new friend of yours?
3372934 3374893 I'm not so sure.
3374980 3377548 Looks like you upset her.
3377635 3379941 Shall I take this<br />as a good sign?
3380028 3381987 -What?<br />-Your attire.
3382074 3384076 Is Bruce Wayne<br />making an actual appearance?
3384163 3386165 There's a public memorial<br />for Mayor Mitchell.
3386252 3389864 Serial killers like to follow<br />reactions to their crimes.
3389951 3391518 Riddler might not<br />be able to resist.
3391605 3394173 Oh, that reminds me.
3394260 3396828 I've taken the liberty<br />of doing a little work
3396915 3398656 on this latest cipher.
3398743 3400614 The one from the rat maze.
3400701 3404009 I'm afraid his Spanish<br />is not perfect,
3404096 3405924 but I'm fairly certain<br />this translates to,
3406011 3409797 "You are <i>El Rata Alada."</i>
3409884 3411408 [Bruce] <i>Rata Alada?</i>
3411495 3412583 "Rat with wings"?
3412670 3413888 It's slang for "pigeon."
3413975 3415281 Does that mean anything<br />to you?
3415368 3416456 Yeah.
3417979 3419546 A stool pigeon.
3419633 3421983 -Where are your cufflinks?<br />-I couldn't find them.
3423507 3425465 Well, you can't<br />go out like that.
3425552 3427293 Alfred, I don't want<br />your cufflinks.
3431515 3433473 You have to keep up<br />appearances.
3433560 3435910 -You're still a Wayne.<br />-[scoffs]
3435997 3438173 And what about you?<br />Are you a Wayne?
3439218 3440959 Your father gave them to me.

3543757 3545150 [bodyguard] Hey!
3545237 3546891 Give us a wide berth here,<br />would you, slick?
3547892 3550111 Hey, watch it, fellas.
3550198 3552461 You got the prince<br />of the city there.
3555595 3557466 Some event, huh?
3557554 3559251 Brought out the one guy<br />in the city
3559338 3560644 more reclusive than me.
3560731 3563124 Thought you'd never leave<br />the Shoreline.
3563211 3564778 Aren't you afraid<br />someone'll take a shot at you?
3564865 3566780 Why? 'Cause your father<br />ain't around?
3567694 3569609 Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?
3569696 3571306 Wow, is that right?
3571393 3574222 His father saved my life.
3574309 3577443 I got shot in the chest.<br />Right here.
3578662 3580011 I couldn't go to no hospital,
3580098 3582404 so we showed up<br />on his doorstep.
3582491 3585669 Operated right<br />on the dining room table.
3585756 3588889 Kid here,<br />he saw the whole thing,
3588976 3590978 up on the stairs looking down.
3592414 3594416 I remember your face.
3596462 3598725 You don't think that meant<br />something, he did that?
3598812 3600858 It meant he took<br />the Hippocratic oath.
3602250 3603774 "Hippocratic oath."
3606341 3608039 That's good.
3608126 3609257 Excuse me.

4386991 4388471 Kenzie moonlights<br />for the Penguin?
4391256 4393171 Or he moonlights as a cop.
4397784 4399264 -[officer] Jesus Christ!<br />-[Kenzie] Go!
4399351 4400787 [officer 2] Somebody stop him!
4400874 4402702 [officers clamoring]

4459542 4460717 [grunting]
4465635 4467288 [groaning]
4486917 4488745 [Gordon] Could have at least<br />pulled that punch, man.
4489310 4490529 I did.
4490616 4492357 Bock put out an APB on you.
4492444 4494011 You really think<br />he's in on this?
4494098 4496100 I don't trust any of 'em.<br />Do you?
4496187 4498015 I only trust you.
4498102 4499756 What's a narcotics cop doing<br />with Falcone's right-hand man?
4499843 4501975 Colson said,<br />"Cops protect the rat."
4502062 4503847 Maybe Kenzie's part of it.
4503934 4505239 You think Penguin's the rat?
4505326 4506719 His club caters to the mob.
4506806 4508373 Maroni<br />practically lived there.
4508460 4510244 Penguin would have been<br />privy to a lot of dirt.
4510331 4511724 DA was a regular, too.
4511811 4513552 Maybe Penguin<br />got himself into a jam
4513639 4516294 and working a deal<br />was his only way out.
4516381 4518688 -The <i>Rata Alada.</i><br />-The what?
4518775 4520254 Riddler's latest.
4520341 4521995 The cipher in the maze.
4522082 4524476 It means "a rat with wings."<br />Like a stool pigeon.
4526086 4527653 A penguin's got wings, too.
4529742 4531701 Time for me to have<br />another conversation with him.
4531788 4533398 What about the Riddler?<br />He's gonna kill again.
4533485 4534747 It's all connected.
4534834 4536836 Like it or not,<br />it's his game now.
4536923 4539926 You want to find Riddler,<br />we gotta find that rat.

4579705 4581315 -[Penguin] How you doing?<br />-[man] Yeah, good. How are you?
4581402 4582665 [Penguin] Good, good.

4591282 4593414 [suspenseful music continues]
4603163 4605688 It's a drug lab. Drops.
4605775 4607124 This is a buy.
4607211 4608604 Looks like<br />they got Maroni's operation
4608691 4610214 up and running again.
4610301 4611345 Or they never<br />shut it down at all.
4611432 4613086 [Gordon] <i>What are you saying?</i>
4613173 4616176 The biggest drug bust<br />in GCPD history was a fraud?

4640548 4642376 This just got complicated.

4669969 4671318 Sneaking up on girls<br />in the dark?
4671405 4673756 Is that why<br />you work in the club?
4673843 4675235 It was all just a score?
4675322 4676846 You know, I would love<br />to sit and go over
4676933 4678891 every gory detail<br />with you, bat boy,
4678978 4681851 but, uh, those assholes<br />are coming back.

5110061 5111367 [Gordon] Let's make it<br />easy for you, Oz.
5111454 5112933 Cops caught you<br />doing something.
5113020 5114587 They were gonna<br />shut you down, put you away.
5114674 5116459 So you gave up a bigger fish<br />to save your ass.
5116546 5118635 You ratted out<br />Salvatore Maroni.
5118722 5120158 His drops operation.
5120245 5121377 [Gordon] But the cops,<br />the city officials,
5121464 5122465 the mayor, the DA,
5122552 5123857 they got greedy, right?
5123944 5126208 Wasn't enough,<br />a big career-making bust.
5126295 5128035 They wanted to take over<br />the drops business too,
5128123 5130429 but they needed a minor league<br />mope like you to run it.
5130516 5132692 You don't just work<br />for Carmine Falcone.
5132779 5133824 You work for them, too.
5133911 5135217 What are you, crazy?
5135304 5136131 [Gordon] That why<br />you killed the girl?
5136218 5137567 I didn't kill no girl!
5137654 5139134 We know she worked for you<br />at the 44 Below.
5139221 5140396 But she got too close, right?
5140483 5141875 Found out from Mitchell
5141962 5143268 that you were the rat,<br />so you killed her.
5143355 5144661 But somehow<br />Riddler found out, too.
5144748 5146750 He knows so much about you.
5146837 5149361 -You must know about him.<br />-Who is he?
5149448 5152016 Boy, you guys are a hell<br />of a duet here.
5152103 5153844 Why don't you start<br />harmonizing?
5153931 5156238 There's only one problem with<br />your little scenario, okay?
5156325 5157978 I ain't no rat!
5158065 5159676 You got any idea what<br />Carmine Falcone would do to me
5159763 5160981 if he heard this kind of talk?
5161068 5162940 Oh, you don't wanna talk<br />about rats, huh?
5163027 5164333 Maybe we can talk about
5164420 5165638 what they did<br />to my partner's face.
5165725 5167249 Holy God, what are you<br />showing me here?
5167336 5168946 -This was around his head!<br />-Come on!
5169033 5170948 [yells] Open your eyes!
5174908 5176606 Are you <i>El Rata Alada?</i>
5176693 5178085 <i>El Rata Alada?</i>
5178173 5179348 [Gordon] Yeah,<br />a "rat with wings."

5182481 5185180 It says you are <i>El Rata Alada.</i>
5185267 5186529 "You are <i>El Rata"?</i><br />It says that?
5186616 5187747 Why, you got something<br />to tell us?
5187834 5189358 Yeah!
5189445 5190837 It's, like, the worst Spanish<br />I ever heard.
5190924 5193100 -What?<br />-It's <i>"La."</i>
5193188 5194928 <i>"La" rata.</i>
5195015 5196974 What, is this Riddler stupid<br />or something?
5197061 5199281 Jesus! Look at you two.

5202066 5203285 Am I the only here<br />knows the difference

5210640 5211815 You think he made a mistake?
5211902 5212990 He doesn't made mistakes.
5213077 5214426 [Penguin] A rat with wings?
5214513 5215949 You know what<br />that sounds like to me?
5216036 5218996 A friggin' bat! Huh?<br />You ever think of that?

5228397 5229485 "are"...
5229572 5230529 <i>"El."</i>
5239277 5241627 Maybe it was a mistake.<br />Maybe he isn't as smart as...

5246328 5248460 Is that him?

5602335 5604555 [detective] <i>The package</i><br /><i>was intended for you.</i>
5604642 5606862 It was a C-4 explosive<br />sent in a mailer.
5606949 5608341 We found this too.
5622573 5624575 [EKG machine beeping]
5631060 5632714 We've sedated him.
5632801 5635194 We just have to hope<br />he stabilizes.
5635281 5638415 You should go home, Mr. Wayne.<br />Get some sleep.
5638502 5640199 Is there anyone else<br />to notify?
5641548 5642854 Next of kin?
5648077 5649165 No.
5650296 5651776 It's just me.
5653082 5654649 [grunting]
5662178 5663745 [panting]
5663832 5666182 [rousing music playing]
5669185 5670403 [spraying]
5687551 5689074 [spray can rattles]
5698605 5700869 [rousing music intensifies]
5744521 5746088 [cat meowing on speakers]
5748003 5749569 [static crackling]
5754966 5756185 Selina?
5762844 5763758 <i>Can you see me?</i>
5767196 5769546 -Yeah, I can see you.<br /><i>-I need to talk to you.</i>
5770503 5771548 <i>Where can we go?</i>
5774986 5777162 [suspenseful music playing]
5782689 5784909 [elevator whirring, thuds]
5784996 5786302 [elevator door opens]
5790045 5791873 Cat burglar<br />pulling another score?
5792830 5793918 What?
5794005 5795398 Wasn't sure I'd see you again.
5795485 5796529 Yeah, well,<br />things were getting
5796616 5798749 a little hot for me, so...
5798836 5800620 How could they do that to her?
5800707 5802622 That piece of shit cop,<br />Kenzie.
5802709 5804668 Her body was in his car.
5804755 5806801 I'm gonna find him<br />and I'm gonna make him pay.
5806888 5808628 -You gonna help me?<br />-Help you?
5808715 5810674 Yeah. I thought<br />you were "Vengeance."
5810761 5812284 Your friend got involved<br />with the wrong people.
5812371 5814025 She didn't know any better.
5814112 5815418 Maybe you should have<br />explained it to her.
5815505 5817159 What the hell<br />is that supposed to mean?
5817246 5818595 It means your choices<br />have consequences.
5818682 5821076 Jesus Christ. "Choices"?
5821163 5822381 You know,<br />whoever the hell you are,
5822468 5823992 you obviously grew up rich.
5824079 5826037 -Was it worth it?<br />-What?
5826124 5829606 Compromising yourself<br />for money?
5829693 5833479 What did you have to do<br />to set up that score?
5833566 5837266 How close did you have to get<br />to Penguin? To Falcone?
5837353 5838789 You don't know what the hell<br />you're talking about.
5838876 5841009 -Falcone owes me that money.<br />-He owes you?
5841096 5842662 -Yeah, and a lot more.<br />-Oh, really? Why's that?
5842749 5843794 You know what?<br />I can't even talk to you.
5843881 5845404 No! I want to know
5845491 5846797 why a guy like Falcone<br />would owe you anything.
5846884 5849060 [shouts]<br />Because he's my father!
5858243 5860985 My mother worked<br />at the 44 Below.
5862552 5863814 Just like Anni.
5866034 5868514 She used to take me there<br />when I was a little girl.
5870603 5871909 To the club?
5872867 5873868 Yeah.
5876609 5879830 I hid out in the dressing room<br />while she worked.
5879917 5882354 Used to see him there.
5882441 5884400 He scared the shit out of me.
5886402 5887707 And I could never understand
5887794 5890319 why he looked at me<br />the way he did.
5890406 5894062 Then one night,<br />my mother told me who he was.
5897587 5899894 When I was seven,<br />my mother was murdered.
5900546 5902418 Strangled.
5902505 5903854 Never found out who.
5903941 5905900 Probably some creep<br />from the club.
5907858 5909816 Anyway, social services<br />came to take me away,
5909904 5912123 and he didn't say a thing.
5913995 5915779 Couldn't even look at me.
5919565 5921263 He owes me that money.
5923134 5924483 I'm sorry.
5925615 5926790 For what I said.
5928183 5929575 Ah, it's all right.
5930402 5931447 [chuckles dryly]
5933101 5935146 You assume the worst<br />in people.
5936104 5937453 Which, well...
5939977 5941848 maybe we're not<br />so different after all.
5947158 5948899 Who are you under there?
5954992 5956863 What are you hiding?
5959257 5961042 Are you just...
5962695 5964349 hideously scarred?
5966482 5967483 Yeah.
5968658 5969789 [chuckles lightly]
5974707 5976100 Listen to me.
5977884 5981671 If we don't stand up<br />for Annika, no one will.
5981758 5983847 All anyone cares about<br />in this place
5983934 5987068 are these white,<br />privileged assholes.
5987155 5990114 The mayor,<br />the commissioner, the DA.
5990201 5991507 Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.
5991594 5993030 I mean, as far<br />as I'm concerned,
5993117 5994901 that psycho's right<br />to go after these creeps.
5994989 5996381 I think you'd be on his side.
5996468 5997948 What do you mean,<br />"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?
5998035 6000037 What, do you live in a cave?
6000124 6003214 The Riddler's latest.<br />It's all about the Waynes.
6003301 6007218 Listen, if I can find<br />that dickbag Kenzie,
6007305 6008393 will you help me?
6009655 6010961 Please.
6013746 6015618 Come on, Vengeance.
6018142 6020449 Just don't make any moves<br />without me, understand?
6020536 6022059 It's a little more dangerous<br />than you know...
6022146 6024322 [romantic music playing]
6031938 6033462 I told you, baby.
6035246 6037814 I can take care of myself.
6048781 6052002 [Thomas] <i>I'm Thomas Wayne,</i><br /><i>and I approve this message.</i>
6052089 6054700 [triumphant music playing]
6059836 6061403 <i>From a very young age,</i>
6061490 6063405 <i>my family, Martha's family,</i><br /><i>the Arkhams,</i>
6063492 6065363 <i>instilled in both of us</i>

6068149 6070238 <i>it's a passion.</i>
6070325 6073806 <i>That is our family's legacy.</i>
6073893 6076200 [Riddler on TV]<br /><i>The Waynes and the Arkhams.</i>
6076287 6078768 <i>Gotham's founding families.</i>
6078855 6083251 <i>But what is their real legacy?</i>
6083338 6086167 <i>Twenty years ago,</i><br /><i>one reporter set out</i>
6086254 6088038 <i>to uncover the dark truth.</i>
6088125 6092434 <i>He found</i><br /><i>shocking family secrets.</i>
6092521 6094479 <i>How, when Martha</i><br /><i>was just a child,</i>
6094566 6096612 <i>her mother</i><br /><i>brutally murdered her father,</i>
6096699 6098222 <i>then committed suicide...</i>
6098309 6099876 -[gunshot]<br /><i>-...and how the Arkhams</i>
6099963 6103923 <i>used their power and money</i><br /><i>to cover it up.</i>
6104010 6106056 <i>How Martha herself</i>

6108972 6111931 <i>and they didn't want</i><br /><i>anyone to know.</i>

6137696 6140003 [in deep voice] <i>I hope </i><br /><i>you're listening, Bruce Wayne.</i>
6140090 6142658 <i>This is your legacy too.</i>

6154800 6157063 [club music playing<br />on speakers]
6157977 6159065 Do you know who I am?
6160719 6161851 You're Bruce Wayne.
6161938 6163766 I wanna see Carmine Falcone.
6174559 6175517 See?
6176344 6177867 [scoffs]
6177954 6179303 [elevator bell dings]
6179390 6181392 [romantic old song playing<br />on speakers]
6185744 6187398 [billiard balls clatter]
6187485 6190096 [Falcone] Who is this guy<br />who invented the ball, right?
6190184 6192708 Must have made a fortune.
6192795 6195972 If you think about it,<br />the concept of it, right?
6196059 6198496 Briscoe, do you know<br />how much this sweater cost?
6198583 6199584 [Briscoe] No, boss.
6199671 6202500 [Falcone] $1,183.
6202587 6204546 You know<br />why communism failed, right?
6204633 6205590 [Briscoe] No, boss.
6207549 6208767 [Falcone] Austerity.
6208854 6210987 [men laugh]
6211074 6212641 [Penguin] All right. All right.
6212728 6215383 [Falcone chuckles]<br />Look at that. Perfect.
6215470 6217167 [Penguin] It's never gonna be<br />that good again.
6219387 6221911 Hey, Johnny Slick.
6221998 6223086 What are you doing here?
6225044 6226829 Give us a moment here, fellas.
6227786 6228787 [Penguin] Come on.
6230746 6231921 See ya, champ.
6232965 6234184 Come on, sweetheart.
6236142 6237143 Have a seat.
6239233 6242105 I thought<br />I might hear from you.
6242192 6245239 This, uh, Riddler<br />son of a bitch is really
6246849 6248633 stirring things up, huh?
6248720 6250374 -Is it true?<br />-What?
6251723 6253290 That reporter business?
6254813 6256162 What do you want<br />to know here, kid?
6256250 6258904 Did you kill him?<br />For my father?
6258991 6262517 Look, your father<br />was in trouble.
6262604 6264345 This reporter had some dirt.
6264432 6267173 Some very
6267261 6269872 personal stuff<br />about your mother,
6269959 6271395 her family history.
6271482 6272831 You know, everybody's got<br />their dirty laundry,
6272918 6274311 that's just how it is.
6274398 6275356 But he didn't want<br />none of it coming out,
6275443 6277706 not right before the election.
6277793 6279969 And your father<br />tried to pay the guy off,
6280056 6281753 but he wasn't going for it.
6281840 6283494 So...
6283581 6285061 he came to me.
6285148 6287455 Well, I never seen him<br />like that.
6288325 6290893 He said, "Carmine,
6290980 6295637 "I want you to put<br />the fear of God in this guy."
6298117 6300990 And when fear isn't enough...
6301730 6303166 Oof. Hmm.
6304863 6308127 Your father wanted me<br />to handle it, so I did.
6309128 6310956 I handled it.
6312697 6314133 I know.
6314220 6316397 You thought your father<br />was a Boy Scout.
6317702 6319530 But you'd be surprised
6319617 6322011 what even a good man like him
6322098 6324622 is capable of<br />in the right situation.
6326929 6328626 Do me a favor.
6328713 6330715 Don't lose any sleep over it.
6331455 6333022 This reporter
6333892 6335459 was a lowlife.
6335546 6336982 He was on Maroni's payroll.
6338636 6340943 -Maroni?<br />-Oh, yeah.
6341030 6345121 He could never stand<br />your father and I had history.
6345208 6347297 And... And after what happened<br />with that reporter,
6347384 6349168 Maroni was worried
6349255 6351519 that your father<br />would be in my pocket
6352302 6353912 forever.
6353999 6356045 He would have done anything
6356132 6358264 to keep him<br />from becoming mayor.
6358352 6359657 You understand?
6360919 6362356 Are you saying
6362443 6365446 Salvatore Maroni<br />got my father killed?
6365533 6367535 Do I know it for a fact?
6370015 6372061 I'm just saying,<br />it sure looked that way to me.
6373454 6375760 This is what you wanted, huh?
6375847 6378546 This little conversation here?
6378633 6380591 [exhales ruefully]
6380678 6382811 It's been<br />a long time coming, huh?
6385509 6387555 I mean,<br />you ain't a kid no more.
6390558 6392734 [melancholy music playing]
6437169 6438780 [EKG machine beeping]
6442305 6443785 [inhales sharply]
6449355 6451009 [rain pattering]
6453925 6454883 [sighs]
6457276 6458539 You lied to me...
6461411 6463021 my whole life.
6468244 6470246 I spoke to Carmine Falcone.
6473118 6476382 He told me what he did<br />for my father.
6480517 6481997 About Salvatore Maroni.
6483912 6486610 He told you<br />Salvatore Maroni...
6486697 6488438 Had my father killed.
6490919 6493095 Why didn't you tell me<br />all this?
6495924 6500972 All these years<br />I've spent fighting for him,
6501059 6503235 believing that he was<br />a good man.
6503322 6505542 He was a good man.
6505629 6507370 You listen to me.
6507457 6510808 Your father was a good man.
6514769 6516640 -He made a mistake.<br />-A "mistake."
6516727 6518642 He had a man killed.
6518729 6520992 Why?
6521079 6524213 [sighing]<br />To protect his family image?
6525344 6526607 His political aspirations?
6526694 6528130 It wasn't to protect<br />the family image,
6528217 6530175 and he didn't have<br />anyone killed.
6532787 6535267 He was protecting your mother.
6535354 6538836 He didn't care about his image<br />or the campaign, any of that.
6538923 6541012 He cared about her
6541099 6542753 and you,
6542840 6545408 and in a moment of weakness,<br />he turned to Falcone.
6545495 6549717 But he never thought Falcone<br />would kill that man.
6549804 6551457 Your father should have known
6551545 6553242 that Falcone would do anything
6553329 6556332 to finally have something<br />on him that he could use.
6556419 6558160 That's who Falcone is.
6560554 6562860 And that was<br />your father's mistake.
6562947 6564862 But when Falcone<br />told him what he'd done,
6564949 6568518 your father was distraught.
6568605 6571782 He told Falcone<br />he was going to the police,
6571869 6574002 that he would confess<br />everything.
6575525 6577527 And that night,
6577614 6580312 your father and your mother
6580399 6581531 were killed.
6583577 6585666 [soft music playing]
6587015 6588669 It was Falcone?
6593587 6594718 [smacks lips]
6594805 6596851 Oh, I wish I knew for sure.
6601682 6605207 Or maybe it was some<br />random thug on the street
6605294 6606730 who needed money, got scared,
6606817 6608166 and pulled the trigger<br />too fast.
6608253 6611300 If you don't think<br />I've spent every day
6611387 6613302 searching for that answer...
6615130 6619569 It was my job to protect them.<br />Do you understand?
6619656 6621527 I know you always<br />blamed yourself.
6621615 6624008 You were only a boy, Bruce.
6626228 6628447 I could see the fear<br />in your eyes,
6629884 6632364 but I didn't know how to help.
6632451 6636151 I could teach you<br />how to fight, [sighs]
6636238 6638893 but I wasn't equipped<br />to take care of you.
6638980 6640764 You needed a father.
6642766 6645160 And all you had was me.
6647553 6648729 I'm sorry.
6650513 6652428 Don't be sorry, Alfred.
6659217 6660305 God.
6663395 6667661 I never thought<br />I'd feel fear like that again.
6670489 6672535 I thought<br />I'd mastered all that.
6679020 6680238 I mean,
6681500 6683589 I'm not afraid to die.
6685374 6687681 I realize now<br />there's something
6688856 6690684 I haven't got past.
6691641 6693382 This fear...
6695906 6698779 of ever going through<br />any of that again.
6703087 6705220 Of losing somebody<br />I care about.

6755879 6757054 Hey.
6757141 6759709 I saw the signal.<br />That's not you?
6759796 6761580 I thought it was you.
6765802 6767151 [both grunting]
6774550 6776073 -I found him!<br />-I see that.
6776160 6777771 He had my shit and my phone.
6777858 6779424 She left a message<br />the night they took her.
6779511 6781731 -She called me...<br />-Gordon! Help me out, man!
6781818 6783254 She got my gun!
6783341 6784690 [grunts]
6784778 6787650 -Shut up!<br />-Put the gun down.
6787737 6790218 I'm telling you, God damn it!<br />She called me!
6794788 6796833 -[cellphone beeps]<br />-Here. Listen.
6799096 6800881 [Kenzie on recording]<br /><i>Hey! Get back here!</i>
6800968 6802056 -[Annika whimpering]<br /><i>-Where you going?</i>
6802143 6803884 <i>Come back here!</i>
6803971 6805015 [Falcone] <i>Hey, hey,</i><br /><i>what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>
6805102 6806538 <i>You're scaring her.</i>
6806625 6808192 [Kenzie] <i>I'm...</i><br /><i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>
6808279 6809454 [Annika tearfully]<br /><i>Please, please, please.</i>
6809541 6811152 <i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>
6811239 6813589 [Falcone] <i>Hey, don't be scared.</i><br /><i>Come here.</i>
6815547 6818376 <i>Now let me ask you again.</i>
6818463 6820988 <i>-What did Mitchell tell you?</i><br />-[Annika] <i>No, nothing. He...</i>
6821075 6823991 [Falcone] <i>Don liked to talk.</i><br /><i>I know that.</i>
6824078 6827255 <i>Especially to pretty girls</i><br /><i>like you.</i>
6827342 6829953 <i>That's why I made him</i><br /><i>take your passport,</i>
6830040 6832913 <i>until we could have</i><br /><i>this little conversation.</i>
6833000 6835698 [Annika] <i>All I want to do</i><br /><i>is get out of here, okay?</i>
6835785 6837395 <i>You'll never hear from me</i><br /><i>again, nobody will.</i>
6837482 6839267 <i>Please, please...</i>
6839354 6841791 [Falcone] <i>We're gonna get you</i><br /><i>out of here, I promise.</i>
6841878 6845447 <i>But first, I gotta know...</i>
6845534 6847579 <i>-What did he tell you?</i><br />-[Annika] <i>He...</i>
6847666 6851757 <i>He just said they all made</i><br /><i>a deal with you.</i>
6851845 6854935 [Falcone] <i>Oh. Hmm.</i><br /><i>He told you about that, huh?</i>
6855022 6856327 <i>The deal.</i>
6856414 6858112 [Annika] <i>He said</i>
6858199 6861332 <i>you gave some information</i><br /><i>on some drops thing,</i>
6861419 6864161 <i>and that's how</i><br /><i>he became mayor.</i>
6864248 6866555 <i>He said you were</i><br /><i>a very important man.</i>
6866642 6867773 [Falcone] <i>Right.</i>
6868470 6869819 <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
6870776 6872996 <i>Hmm. Okay.</i>
6874432 6877914 -[tussling on recording]<br />-[Annika screams]
6878001 6880612 -[Annika cries]<br />-[tussling continues]
6880699 6882005 -[Falcone] <i>Just take it easy.</i><br />-[Annika choking]
6882092 6883659 Jesus, he's strangling her.
6883746 6886749 [Falcone] <i>Take it easy.</i>
6888533 6889708 [recording stops]
6895976 6897238 <i>Rata Alada.</i>
6902286 6904071 A falcon has wings, too.
6904158 6905942 Falcone is the rat?
6916953 6920652 Falcone works for you guys?
6920739 6923264 The mayor? The DA?
6926354 6927921 No. [breathing shakily]
6930488 6931750 We work for him.
6932751 6934014 Everybody does.
6934101 6935189 How?
6935276 6937495 Through Renewal.
6937582 6938975 Renewal is everything.
6939062 6940846 -The Renewal Fund?<br />-[Kenzie] Yeah.
6940934 6942239 After Thomas Wayne died,
6942326 6944763 they all went after it<br />like vultures.
6944850 6948463 The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.<br />Everyone got in on it.
6948550 6950595 It was perfect<br />for making bribes,
6950682 6952119 laundering money.
6952206 6953859 A huge charitable fund<br />with no oversight.
6953947 6955731 Everybody got a piece.
6955818 6957646 But Falcone wanted more.
6959691 6962825 So he orchestrated a play<br />to take Maroni down big.
6964174 6966785 He'd rat out<br />his drops operation,
6966872 6969658 make the careers of everybody<br />that went after him,
6969745 6972139 then install them all<br />as his puppets.
6972226 6974706 You think this goddamn<br />election matters?
6976360 6979102 Falcone's the mayor.
6979189 6981670 He's been the mayor<br />for the last 20 years.
6981757 6983759 Come on, Vengeance.
6983846 6986283 Let's go kill<br />that son of a bitch.
6986370 6987632 This creep too.<br />Let's finish this.
6987719 6988807 -Oh, God!<br />-No!
6988894 6990287 [gun clatters]
6990374 6992202 We'll get him.
6992289 6994204 -But not that way.<br />-There is no other way!
6994291 6997381 -He owns the city!<br />-Cross that line,
6997468 6999383 you'll become just like him.
6999470 7000994 Listen to me.
7001081 7002952 Don't throw your life away.
7009480 7010829 Don't worry, honey.
7013919 7015356 I got nine of 'em.
7015443 7017445 -[screams]<br />-[Gordon] No, don't! Hey, hey!
7018794 7021014 [Kenzie] Oh, God! [whimpering]
7029631 7031285 [Gordon] She won't<br />get out of there alive.
7031372 7033417 And if she kills Falcone,<br />we may never find the Riddler.
7033504 7035593 -I have to stop her.<br />-Don't you mean "we"?
7036942 7038727 I gotta do this my way.
7038814 7039815 And then what?
7040729 7042861 We do what Riddler said.
7042948 7044515 Bring the rat into the light.
7047649 7050043 [dramatic music playing]
7053133 7054612 [engine roaring]
7080464 7082510 Can you tell Mr. Falcone<br />I'd like to come up?
7082597 7084599 He ain't seein' nobody<br />tonight.
7084686 7085991 Tell him it's about Annika.
7089212 7091301 Hey!
7091388 7092998 Look who it is, huh?
7093086 7095436 -Sorry to bother you.<br />-Nah. It's fine, beautiful.
7095523 7097481 I was just hoping I could<br />talk to you for a minute?
7097568 7099004 Absolutely.
7100745 7101746 Alone?
7101833 7103183 [banging on door]
7103270 7105446 [muffled club music playing]
7118415 7119634 Hey!
7119721 7121810 [club music playing<br />on speakers]
7129948 7131167 [tearfully]<br />I'm just so worried.
7131254 7132821 I... I don't know<br />where she is.
7134605 7138087 And I know that<br />you're a very important man.
7138174 7140829 I was hoping that maybe<br />you could help me find her...
7140916 7142918 [inhales shakily]
7143005 7146748 because she's been gone<br />so long, I'm beginning to...
7146835 7149316 -I'm sorry. [sniffling]<br />-It's okay.
7149403 7151535 -I'm so sorry.<br />-I understand. Here.
7151622 7154451 No, that's okay,<br />I have a tissue.
7158760 7160544 -Mr. Falcone?<br />-Vinnie!
7160631 7162459 -Didn't I tell you?<br />-I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.
7162546 7164461 I really think you're gonna<br />want to see this.
7166594 7168204 [Falcone] I'm sorry, beautiful.
7168291 7169510 I'll be right back.
7175820 7177996 [dramatic music playing]
