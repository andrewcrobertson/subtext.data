116824 119410 [newscaster on TV]<br />...a dark and stormy Halloween.
119869 122371 [news jingle plays on TV]
123497 126417 Good evening and welcome to<br />GC-1 News live at 8:00.
126500 128044 Our top story tonight,
128127 130463 Just-released polls have<br />incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.
130546 134383 and 28-year-old grassroots challenger<br />Bella Real in a dead heat.
134467 135968 Things certainly got hot last night
136052 139513 in their final debate<br />before next Tuesday's election.
139597 143643 Now, my young opponent here wants to<br />gut the Gotham Renewal Program,
143726 145478 established by the great Thomas Wayne.
145561 148314 Cutting funds from vital projects<br />like our sea wall
148397 149857 and the safety net<br />for those who need it.
149940 154111 The Renewal Program is broken.<br />This city's been renewing for 20 years.
154195 156989 Look where it's gotten us.<br />Crime has skyrocketed.
157073 158449 Murder and drug use<br />are at historic highs.
158532 159450 Now wait... Now hang on.
159533 161786 We have a masked vigilante<br />running the street.
161869 162912 Under my administration,
162995 166791 the Gotham PD has dealt major blows<br />to organized crime and drug trafficking.
166874 170378 The Salvatore Maroni case was<br />the biggest drug bust in city history.
170461 172755 But drops and other drugs<br />are still rampant.
172838 173798 It's gotten worse.
173881 175174 I'm not saying there isn't work to do.
175257 176217 -But listen...<br />-[phone rings]
176300 177718 I have a beautiful<br />wife and young son, okay?
177802 179261 -And I will not rest...<br />-[mutes TV]
181597 182890 [picks up phone]
183766 184767 Hey.
185184 186644 [low eerie music playing]
187228 188938 Yeah, I'm watching it now.
189146 190690 [TV muted]
194276 195820 Why is she still tied?
200408 203411 But I thought we were getting<br />a bump in the new Post poll.
210501 212920 Okay, you know what?<br />I can't watch this anymore.
213003 214880 Just call me in the morning, okay?
214964 215965 [phone beeps]
218092 220511 [Don on TV] ...who still believes in<br />everything this city can do.
220594 223139 [Bella] We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,<br />not a cheerleader.
223222 225891 And someone who will<br />tell the people the truth.
226016 227309 [applause on TV]

267266 272563 [breathing deeply and heavily]
304678 307681 [Bruce] Thursday, October 31st.
308474 309558 [crackling]
317566 319777 [car horns honking]
320528 323280 The city streets are crowded<br />for the holiday.
326450 328118 Even with the rain.
328869 330871 [chatter and laughter]
331622 335084 Hidden in the chaos is the element,
336001 338087 waiting to strike like snakes.
339588 341090 But I'm there too.
342132 343843 <i>Watching.</i>
345427 349849 Two years of nights have turned me<br />into a nocturnal animal.
355229 358023 I must choose my targets carefully.
361360 362987 [suspenseful music playing]
368659 370744 -[indistinct TV chatter]<br />-[entry bell chimes]
371662 373497 -[gunman] Come on! Give me the money.<br />-[cashier] Okay.
373664 376292 -[gunman] Let's go! Let's go!<br />-[cashier] All right, all right!
376375 377877 [Bruce] It's a big city.
382506 384216 I can't be everywhere.
387887 389138 -[rowdy laughter]<br />-[grunts]
390514 391891 [cheers and laughter]
394810 396729 But they don't know where I am.
401901 403652 -[laughter]<br />-Look at this guy, man.
408991 409825 Boom!
410117 411160 [gang] Whoo-hoo-hoo!
414914 416749 [gang member 1] So good, man.<br />That's what I'm talking about!
416832 418250 [gang member 2] Yo, let's see your hits.
419084 420461 That's you.
421378 423464 [tense music playing]
440940 444860 [Bruce] We have a signal now.<br />For when I'm needed.
446570 448822 But when that light hits the sky,
449698 451700 it's not just a call.
453285 454828 It's a warning.
456622 457623 To them.
461794 463045 [helicopter blades whirring]
467341 468550 Fear...
469593 471261 [uneasy music playing]
471887 473681 Is a tool.
482564 484400 -[tires screech]<br />-[car horn blares]
484775 487945 [driver] Are you out of your mind?<br />Watch where you're goin', drop head!
499790 502334 [Bruce]<br />They think I'm hiding in the shadows.
502543 503961 [heroic music playing]
504086 505212 [sirens wailing]
505295 506296 [thug] Come on!
514722 516640 [Bruce] But I am the shadows.
522187 523689 [brakes screech]
528527 529528 [PA chimes]
529611 531447 [indistinct announcement on PA]
535409 536994 -[gang leader] Come on, come on.<br />-[gang member] Whoo!
538370 539455 -Hey, go on, man! Go!<br />-Get him!
539538 540998 -Come on, man!<br />-What are you doin'?
541957 543208 -[man] Help!<br />-[gang laughs]
543292 544501 Somebody help me!
545294 547296 Help, help!

552968 554094 [gang laughs]
554178 555387 [gang member 1]<br />Where you goin', huh?
555596 557139 [gang member laughing derisively]
560184 561143 Come on.
561226 562895 Come on, man. Break it.
565064 566482 You can't move, huh?
566857 568567 Now knock his ass out.
568650 570360 Showtime. Showtime, man.
570903 571987 Come on, man.
572071 573322 Come on. Do it, man.
574531 576200 [muffled clanging]
576909 579119 -[menacing music playing]<br />-[footsteps approaching]
585042 587211 [footsteps coming closer]
606146 608232 [laughing]
608649 610275 You see this guy?
617491 619118 The hell are you supposed to be?
625833 627251 [gang leader grunting]
630754 631797 [water splashes]
636135 637427 I'm vengeance.
638554 640472 Holy shit. It's him.
647229 648689 [yelps]
652234 653944 [gang grunting]
659074 660159 [chokes]
660450 661493 [grunting]
666165 667291 Hey, man. No, no, no!
672171 673714 [groaning]
706330 707956 [man breathing raggedly]
709041 710417 Please don't hurt me.
722179 724181 [soft music playing]
732272 734107 [hushed chatter]
746453 748038 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
749414 750832 Police action.
751416 753085 He's with me, Officer.
755337 756922 Are you kidding me, sir?
757839 759591 You're gonna let him in here?
760259 763053 Martinez, let him through.
765973 767516 [Martinez sighs]
776692 778443 Goddamn freak.
794334 795419 What do we know?
806263 807639 Detective?
807723 809349 Sorry, Lieutenant.
810225 814730 We got blunt force trauma.<br />Lacerations on the head.
815480 818650 He got hit a lot of times. And hard.
821820 823447 All this blood is from his head?
823905 824906 No.
829244 830454 Excuse me.
832748 834624 Most of it's from his hand.
840088 841131 Thumb was severed.
842758 844968 Killer may have taken it as a trophy.
845344 847262 [Batman]<br />He was alive when it was cut off.
848555 849973 Ecchymosis...
851224 852768 around the wound.
867991 869701 [lead detective]<br />Security detail downstairs
869785 871995 said the family was out<br />trick-or-treat in".
873497 875707 The mayor was up here alone.
878126 880837 Killer may have come<br />through the skylight.
887219 889012 [Gordon] You said there was a card.
889096 890680 [lead detective] Yeah.
900816 903860 [Gordon] "From your secret friend. Whoo?
905153 906863 Haven't a clue?
906947 909324 Let's play a game, just me and you.
910367 912911 What does a liar do when he's dead?"
914246 916331 There's a cipher too.
923088 924965 Any of this mean anything to you?
927509 928718 What's going on here?
931805 933223 I asked him to come, Pete.
933306 934975 [Pete] This is a crime scene.
935058 937394 It's Mitchell, for Christ sakes!
937477 939479 I got the press downstairs.
939563 942315 You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,<br />'cause we got history.
942399 944234 But this is way over the line.
947904 948989 Wait.
949072 950782 -He's involved in this?<br />-No, he's not involved.
950866 951992 How do you know?
952075 955078 He's a goddamn vigilante!<br />He could be a suspect!
955162 956913 What are you doin' to me?<br />We used to be partners.
956997 958623 [Gordon] I'm just trying<br />to find the connection, Pete.
958707 960250 He lies still.
961751 962752 Excuse me?
964296 965380 The riddle.
965964 969384 What does a liar do when he's dead?<br />He lies still.
978518 980020 Oh, Jesus.
983273 986067 This must be your favorite night<br />of the year, huh, pal?
987068 988904 Happy fuckin' Halloween.
989696 991323 [Martinez] Excuse me, Commissioner.
992407 994075 They're ready for your statement.
998121 999831 I want him outta here.
1000457 1001541 Now!
1008131 1009341 Come on.
1013595 1014763 [camera shutter clicking]
1022145 1023355 Yeah.
1024606 1026024 The kid found him.
1031029 1034032 [detective] Was there anyone else<br />in the house when you arrived?
1034282 1036368 [melancholy song playing]
1050465 1052634 We really gotta go, man.
1058223 1061935 [Pete] Tonight, a son lost a father.
1062394 1064229 A wife lost a husband.
1065438 1066982 And I lost a friend.
1068066 1070610 Mayor Mitchell<br />was a fighter for the city,
1070694 1073780 and I will not rest<br />until his killer is found.
1074239 1076408 This was a truly senseless crime,
1077158 1080579 and we are actively pursuing<br />every investigative lead we have
1080662 1084749 in order to identify the perpetrator<br />and hunt him down.
1084833 1086084 I've spoken to the governor...
1086167 1089004 [Bruce] / wish I could say<br />I'm making a difference,
1089087 1090672 but I don't know.
1091089 1093425 [melancholy song continues]
1096595 1099472 Murder, robberies, assault.
1099556 1101641 Two years later, they're all up.
1102392 1103727 And now this.
1105895 1107480 The city's eating itself.
1110191 1111443 Maybe it's beyond saving.
1113528 1115822 But I have to try.
1116615 1117866 Push myself.
1118158 1120327 [melancholy song continues]
1135884 1137427 [engine revving]
1149147 1150565 [bats chittering]
1163953 1166456 These nights all roll together in a rush
1167415 1169334 behind the mask.
1173838 1176132 Sometimes in the morning,
1177926 1180095 I have to force myself to remember
1182472 1184057 everything that happened.
1185058 1186434 [groaning]
1198613 1200198 [newscaster on TV] Unbelievable<br />breaking news this hour, everyone.
1200281 1204160 Again, four-term incumbent<br />Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.
1204244 1207080 was found murdered last night<br />inside his home
1207163 1208915 in the exclusive Crest Hill district.
1208998 1210667 [newscaster 2]<br />Exact details of the crime
1210750 1212252 still have not been released,
1212335 1215213 but a citywide manhunt<br />is already underway
1215296 1218550 as police and FBI search<br />for the brazen Killer.
1218675 1220468 And this certainly is not the first time
1220552 1223096 Gotham has been rocked by<br />the murder of a political figure.
1223179 1227434 In fact, in an eerie coincidence,<br />it was 20 years ago this week
1227517 1229269 that celebrated<br />billionaire philanthropist
1229352 1231312 Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha
1231396 1234232 were slain during Wayne's<br />own mayoral campaign.
1234315 1238153 It was a shocking crime<br />that remains unsolved to this day.
1238236 1240029 Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career
1240113 1242782 was especially notable<br />for his tough war on drugs
1242866 1246119 when he and city police<br />launched a major sting operation,
1246202 1250165 resulting in the arrest of notorious<br />mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni
1250248 1254419 with what, to this day, remains<br />the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.
1254502 1255920 I assume you heard about this.
1256171 1257630 [newscaster 2 continues indistinctly]
1257797 1259048 -Yeah.<br />-[video fast-forwarding]
1266055 1267390 Oh, I see.
1268224 1270143 [Gordon on video]<br />All this blood is from his head?
1270685 1271895 Dear God.
1280653 1282697 [lead detective] There's a cipher too.
1290705 1292999 [Gordon]<br />Any of this mean anything to you?
1293833 1295418 [camera shutter clicking]
1296169 1297962 The killer left this for the Batman?
1299380 1301049 <i>Gordon}<br />I asked him to come, Pete.</i>
1301132 1302133 Apparently.
1302425 1304302 You're becoming quite a celebrity.
1306346 1307680 Why is he writing to you?
1307764 1309182 [Pete]<br />It's Mitchell, for Christ sakes!
1309265 1310308 I don't know yet.
1310391 1311935 [Pete] I got the press downstairs.
1313812 1315230 Have a shower.
1316689 1318358 Our accounting friends<br />at Wayne Enterprises
1318441 1319359 are coming for breakfast.
1319442 1321444 Here? Why?
1321528 1322612 Because I couldn't get you to go there.
1322695 1323780 I haven't got time for this.
1323863 1325532 It's getting serious, Bruce.
1325615 1328701 If this continues, it won't be long<br />before you've nothing left.
1328785 1330370 I don't care about that.
1331287 1332163 Any of that.
1332247 1333748 You don't care about<br />your family's legacy?
1336125 1339254 What I'm doing is my family's legacy.
1339337 1341506 If I can't change things here,
1342048 1343967 if I can't have an effect,
1345051 1346678 then I don't care what happens to me.
1346761 1347887 That's what I'm afraid of.
1347971 1349597 Alfred, stop.
1350974 1352433 You're not my father.
1355228 1356646 I'm well aware.
1359941 1362235 [somber music playing]
1363486 1364821 [machine whirs]
1390972 1393224 [Gordon on video]<br />We really gotta go, man.
1402150 1404152 [soft classical music playing]
1418875 1420460 Some fresh berries there.
1427634 1428760 What are you doing?
1429135 1432805 Just reminiscing about<br />my days in the Circus.
1433181 1437101 [inhales sharply]<br />This is actually quite elusive.
1440104 1441773 Where'd you get those O's?
1441898 1443232 [Alfred smacks lips]
1443316 1446110 "He lies still" is only a partial key.
1446194 1448613 It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.
1448696 1452742 So, I'm looking for any double symbols<br />to start, trying letters,
1452825 1454202 see where it leads.
1456120 1457121 That's interesting.
1458373 1459499 [woman] Mr. Pennyworth?
1459874 1460875 Yes, Dory?
1461209 1462669 The accountants are here.
1462752 1464587 See them in, please, Dory.
1467507 1469717 [Bruce] What if it's not a partial key?
1469801 1471386 What do you mean?
1471469 1473304 What if this is the whole key?
1474222 1476766 Ignore the symbols<br />we don't have letters for.
1476849 1478893 Use only the letters from<br />"He lies still" and leave the rest...
1478977 1480144 Blank. Yeah, I understand.
1480228 1482355 But that would leave<br />most of the cipher unsolved.
1482438 1484273 I don't see how that's gonna...
1484857 1486651 [suspenseful music playing]
1486818 1487819 Oh.
1501624 1503292 [Gordon] Damn.
1503459 1505712 Yeah, he's got a car.
1506629 1509007 Guess it's good to be the mayor.
1509090 1510758 Where to even start?
1511342 1513678 You sure this isn't a leap?<br />"Drive" could mean anything.
1513761 1514762 [Batman] You don't trust me?
1515763 1517390 You mean like you trust me?
1517473 1520351 It's been two years now,<br />and I don't even know who you are, man.
1522353 1523479 [Batman] There.
1525982 1527525 [suspenseful music continues]
1535408 1536784 [air hissing]
1546586 1547879 What are we looking for?
1548504 1550048 A USB port.
1550131 1551257 USB?
1551507 1553009 [whirring]
1558347 1559515 What?
1564896 1567148 "Thumb" drive.
1567940 1569567 Jesus.
1573196 1574697 It's encrypted.
1578117 1579410 Try this.
1586417 1588795 Oh, this guy's hilarious.
1593466 1595176 -[key clacks]<br />-[beep]
1597678 1600264 Oh, well, well, well.
1600681 1602934 So much for family values.
1603101 1604268 Who is she?
1604352 1605937 No idea.
1606854 1609690 But that's the Penguin,<br />Carmine Falcone's right hand.
1610024 1611526 -I know who he is.<br />-[notification whooshing]
1611984 1612985 What was that?
1614737 1617573 Shit, shit! The drive.
1618324 1620660 It sent out the photos from my account.
1620743 1623287 Gotham Post, Gazette, GC-1, all of them.
1623371 1625456 Jesus.
1625540 1627917 I'm gonna catch hell for this.<br />Pete's gonna bust a gasket.
1628000 1629460 "He lies still."
1629669 1630711 About her?
1631963 1633548 Maybe.
1633714 1635591 That's the Iceberg Lounge.
1635675 1639095 It's under the Shoreline Lofts<br />where Falcone was holed up.
1639178 1641305 Never get in there without a warrant.
1643641 1644725 Yeah.
1649313 1651232 [train rumbles past]
1656362 1657738 [muffled dance music playing]
1657822 1659031 Know who I am?
1660366 1662618 Yeah. I got an idea.
1663077 1664495 I want to see the Penguin.
1665204 1667456 I don't know<br />what you're talking about, pal.
1672837 1673838 What's the problem?
1673921 1675339 Says he wants to see the Penguin.
1675423 1677592 Penguin? There's no Penguin here.
1677675 1679302 That's what I tried to tell him.
1679385 1681679 Get out of here, freak. You hear me?
1681762 1683639 Or that little suit's<br />gonna get all full of blood.
1685016 1686100 Mine or yours?
1690938 1692940 [dance music continues on speakers]
1694442 1695401 [twin 1] Get him!
1695484 1696652 [woman] I saw that whole thing.
1696736 1697945 [twin 1] He's over there!
1698029 1699363 [woman] What is your problem?
1699655 1701407 [dance music continues on speakers]
1715588 1716631 [grunting]
1742031 1744200 Hey! Put the bat down,<br />or I'll blow your head off!

1758547 1760341 You looking for me?

1771644 1773062 How you doing?
1773688 1775106 I'm Oz.
1776524 1778150 [people cheering]
1780653 1781904 [Batman] Who is she?
1782363 1784073 [muffled club music playing]
1784949 1786867 I really don't know, chief.
1787576 1789787 I might have been coming out<br />at the same time,
1789870 1791247 but I wasn't rolling with them.
1791998 1793666 [footsteps approaching]
1804677 1805678 It's okay, baby.
1806220 1810016 Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.<br />Come on.
1835750 1836959 Thank you, honey.
1838044 1840171 -[music continues on speakers]<br />-[people cheering]
1843466 1845301 Here you go, champ.
1845384 1848929 I wanna know who she is,<br />and what she has to do with this murder.
1849013 1850806 -Whose murder?<br />-The mayor's.
1851307 1852683 Is that the mayor?
1852767 1854560 Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.
1855770 1857063 Don't make me hurt you.
1857146 1861317 You better watch it.<br />You know my reputation?
1861400 1864362 Yeah, I do. Do you?
1866113 1867615 Look...
1868866 1871660 I'm just the proprietor, okay?
1872495 1876791 I mean, what people do here<br />ain't got nothing to do with me.
1885132 1886717 Tell you one thing.
1888886 1892473 Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.
1892973 1895476 Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?<br />Maybe she knows.
1898729 1900564 What? Too soon?
1907613 1909281 [soft suspenseful music plays]
1910408 1912785 You let me know<br />if there's anything else I can do.
1914036 1915955 -[train wheels squealing]<br />-[sirens wailing nearby]

1946777 1947862 [indistinct talking on phone]
1947945 1949280 Baby, what's wrong?
1949947 1951949 Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />Slow down, slow down. I can't...
1954410 1955828 On the news?
1956495 1959790 Okay. No. No, stay there.<br />Wait for me, okay?
1959874 1961584 Wait for me, I'm on my way home.
1961667 1962668 [woman on phone crying]
1962751 1966380 Listen, baby, we're gonna get<br />the hell out of here, okay? I promise.
1967089 1969717 If we have to leave earlier,<br />we'll leave tonight.
1970634 1971802 -[line disconnects abruptly]<br />-Uh...

2214461 2215754 [panting]
2215838 2217923 He hurt her? That's why you killed him?
2218006 2220759 What? Oh, please.<br />Just give me the goddamn...

2261550 2264011 I didn't kill anybody.<br />I'm here for my friend.
2264094 2265471 She's trying to<br />get the hell out of here,
2265554 2267306 and this son of a bitch<br />stole her passport.
2267389 2268766 What does she know?
2268849 2270976 Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked<br />she won't even tell me.
2271059 2272644 She did seem upset.
2274438 2275939 Back at your place.
2277983 2279485 Let's go talk to her.
2285073 2287075 [engines roaring]
2299046 2301381 [muffled TV chatter]
2305677 2306762 Anni!

2315854 2317105 Anni!
2319566 2320943 [weather woman]<br />It's gonna be cool this evening.
2321026 2323237 It's gonna be down into the 40s.
2323779 2325197 [newscaster]<br />More breaking news this hour
2325280 2330661 as the city is rocked by a second<br />high-profile murder in as many nights.
2330744 2333038 And this time, the killer has<br />come forward to claim credit online...
2333121 2335958 Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?<br />She's just a kid.
2336792 2337751 [sighs]
2337835 2339586 Shit, they took my phone.
2339670 2341046 [newscaster 2] His victim, longtime head<br />of the Gotham City PD,
2341129 2342548 Commissioner Pete Savage,
2342631 2344758 was found dead earlier tonight
2344842 2348053 inside the Police Athletic League<br />facilities in the Tricorner area.
2348136 2351473 The killer posted the following message<br />on social media,
2351557 2354434 and we have to warn you,<br />the video is very disturbing.
2358021 2359314 [deep and heavy breathing on TV]
2359523 2362234 [distorted male voice]<br />Hello, people of Gotham.
2362317 2364278 This is the Riddler speaking.
2365779 2367406 On Halloween night,
2367489 2372286 I killed your mayor because he was not<br />who he pretended to be.
2372369 2374413 But I am not done.
2376081 2377499 [muffled whimpering on TV]
2377583 2379751 Here is another...
2380502 2382087 [whimpering]
2382546 2383881 [rattling]
2384256 2387050 Who will soon be losing face.
2387134 2388302 [Pete whimpers]
2388385 2392598 I will kill again, and again, and again,
2392681 2394516 until our day of judgment
2394600 2399605 when the truth about our city<br />[raises voice] will finally...
2400397 2402399 [in normal tone] be unmasked.
2403984 2405736 Goodbye!
2406320 2408030 [Pete panting and whimpering]
2409990 2411617 [newscaster] Commissioner Savage<br />served a distinguished
2411700 2413827 30-year career on the GCPD...
2413911 2416121 Holy shit, I seen that guy too.
2417497 2418498 At the club.
2420167 2421585 The Iceberg Lounge?
2422336 2423795 44 Below.
2425714 2426715 What is that?
2429968 2431511 The club within the club.
2432596 2434514 [scoffs] The real club.
2436808 2438560 It's a mob hangout.
2439019 2440437 Is that where you work?
2440562 2441730 [cat meows]
2442356 2443190 Selina?
2449071 2450948 No, I just work the bar upstairs.
2454409 2455953 But I see 'em come in.
2456036 2457245 Who?
2457829 2460248 A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,<br />I can tell you that.
2461833 2464503 Your basic upstanding citizen types.
2466755 2468298 You're gonna help me on this.
2468924 2470425 For your friend.
2472094 2473720 [cat meowing]
2481019 2482354 You got a lot of cats.
2483855 2485774 I have a thing about strays.
2486316 2488193 [gentle music playing]
2489903 2491238 You're not safe here.
2492364 2493532 I can take care of myself.
2493615 2496410 [newscaster] Two public figures now dead<br />in just the last two nights,
2496493 2498036 and only days before the election.
2498120 2501373 Police and city officials<br />are left searching for a killer
2501456 2504292 and hoping to find him<br />before he kills again.
2522310 2525480 He waited for him at the gym.
2526606 2528650 Pete always liked to work out<br />late at night,
2528734 2530861 when no one else was around.
2531987 2533405 There's a needle mark on his neck.
2533488 2535449 Injected him with arsenic.
2537451 2538785 Rat poison.
2539578 2541163 Yeah.
2541329 2543790 That seems to be his theme here.
2544332 2545709 Look at this thing.
2545792 2547294 [eerie music playing]
2553842 2555594 It's a maze.
2555761 2556887 [flashlight clicks]
2558180 2561475 What kind of demented son of a bitch<br />does this to a person?
2564227 2565312 [Batman] More symbols.
2567814 2569399 It's another cipher.
2569483 2572235 He blasted these out<br />after his message went viral.
2572903 2575489 Bastard murders you and your reputation.
2575572 2578700 That guy pushes drops. On the east end.
2580285 2581620 I don't get it.
2581703 2584081 Why would Pete get involved<br />in something like this?
2584998 2587000 Looks like he got greedy.
2587084 2588126 You kidding me?
2588210 2590921 After everything we did<br />to take down the Maronis?
2591004 2594257 We busted their entire operation,<br />then he caves to some lowlife dealer?
2594341 2596551 Maybe he's not who you thought.
2598095 2600138 You make it sound like he had it coming.
2602390 2603850 He was a cop.
2605185 2606478 Crossed a line.
2625956 2627082 [flashlight clicks off]
2629334 2630836 [eerie music continues]
2637717 2639386 “I'm mad about you.
2639469 2643140 Want to know my name?<br />Just look inside and see."
2650272 2653358 "Follow the maze until you find the rat.
2653525 2657112 Bring him into the light,<br />and you'll find where I'm at."
2657195 2658905 The hell is that?
2659656 2662826 "Bring him into the light"?<br />"Find the rat"?
2663952 2665453 I don't know.
2666329 2667497 [Martinez] Lieutenant.
2667581 2668999 They're coming back.
2669082 2670333 [Gordon] We got to get out of here.
2671084 2672460 [eerie music continues]
2674421 2675630 Come on.
2680719 2681761 [Selina] Ow!
2683221 2684556 I don't know about these things.
2684639 2688101 I need to see in there,<br />this hunting ground.
2692105 2694691 Hey, why am I starting to feel<br />like a fish on a hook?
2696568 2698028 I'm just looking for Annika.
2702324 2703950 Boy, you're a real sweetheart.
2705076 2707704 You really don't care what happens to me<br />in there tonight, do you?
2708455 2710165 [gentle music playing]
2717255 2718465 Look at me.
2728099 2730268 Looks good. Here.
2736316 2737359 [sighs]

2776398 2777399 Yeah.
2786074 2787075 Hey, where you goin'?
2787701 2788827 Hospitality.
2789577 2792414 [Batman] That's one of the guys<br />I got into it with the other night.
2794207 2795709 Looks like I broke his nose.
2795917 2797460 [door slides open]
2800547 2801715 [computer trilling]
2802382 2804467 "Kenzie, William."
2804551 2806011 He's an off-duty cop.
2807887 2809556 Are you sure no one can see<br />these things in my eyes?
2809889 2811933 Don't worry. I'm watching you.
2812934 2813935 [sighs]
2815353 2818148 -[techno music playing]<br />-[indistinct chatter]
2825613 2826614 [computer trilling rhythmically]
2828491 2831619 Don't look away.<br />I need time to make IDs.
2831703 2832829 Great.
2840086 2842380 These guys have a little problem<br />with eye contact, don't they?
2842464 2844049 Feels good, doesn't it?
2844132 2846343 [man] Yeah, baby. Feels real good.
2852390 2854017 [Selina] Jesus, I hate drop heads.
2854100 2855143 [Batman] Really?
2855226 2856186 'Cause when I first saw you,
2856269 2857479 it looked like you were<br />dealing for Penguin.
2857562 2859814 You don't know<br />what you're talking about. Can we not...
2860440 2862192 Can we not do this right now?
2864110 2865653 Wait. Who was that?
2865737 2866905 Oh, I saw him.
2866988 2868073 [Batman] Look back.
2868156 2869949 If I look back, it's gonna be<br />a whole can of worms.
2870033 2871368 I need to see his face.
2873036 2874496 [sighs] Jesus.
2882504 2883671 That's the DA.
2883755 2884798 Gil Colson.
2884881 2886549 And he's coming over. You happy?
2886633 2887842 [Batman] Talk to him.
2890970 2892055 Hey. How you doing?
2892138 2893223 Hi.
2893306 2894140 I'm Gil.
2895350 2896976 Hey, aren't you the DA?
2897060 2898019 Yeah.
2898228 2900397 Wow. [chuckles] I've seen you on TV.
2900480 2901856 Is that right?
2902273 2904484 I haven't seen you around here before.
2905485 2907529 It's a hell of a time<br />to be the new girl,
2907612 2910156 'cause people are all a little on edge.
2910240 2911741 [Selina] Oh, honey, I live on the edge.
2911825 2912826 -[Gil] Is that right?<br />-[Selina chuckles]
2913118 2914327 [Gil chuckles] / like that.
2914702 2915745 Do you want to come over?
2915829 2916955 Sure.
2919958 2921292 -[Gil] This is Travis.<br />-Hey.
2921376 2922794 [Gil] You wanna take a seat over there?
2923086 2924963 -Richie, Glen.<br />-[Richie] Hey.
2926423 2927924 That's half the DA's office.
2928007 2929175 [Gil] You know Carla here, huh?
2929259 2930218 Hi.
2930301 2932345 That's Cheri. Don't mind her,<br />she's just taking a break.
2932429 2934305 Drowning our sorrows.
2934639 2935932 You want a drop?
2936015 2938059 [Selina] Uh, no, I'm good.<br />But you enjoy.
2938351 2939769 [music continues on speakers]
2940019 2941688 Hope you don't mind.
2941771 2943815 I got a lot on my shoulders<br />with that psycho running around.
2944274 2945233 He's wasted.
2945316 2946359 No shit.
2948027 2949028 [chuckles] I like this girl.
2949487 2951072 Oh, hey, I like you too!
2954617 2957954 I mean, this Riddler, he's going after<br />the most powerful people in the city.
2958037 2959122 He knows so much.
2959205 2960498 [Travis] He doesn't know shit, man.
2960582 2962834 [Gil] What are you talking about?<br />Yeah, he does! What about that rat...
2962917 2963835 [Richie] Hey, hey, Gil, come on.
2963918 2965837 -Think maybe you had a little too much.<br />-Hey. The rat.
2965920 2967881 -[Richie] Slow down.<br />-Ask him about the rat.
2969883 2971718 [Selina] Hey, what's this about a rat?
2975013 2976598 [inhales deeply]
2982061 2983271 I mean...
2984105 2987692 there was a rat. We had an informant.
2988276 2990695 We had big-time information<br />on Salvatore Maroni.
2990778 2992489 That's how we got him out of<br />the drops business.
2992572 2994157 He's talking about the Maroni case.
2994240 2997535 But if this guy knows,<br />it's gonna come out.
2998119 3000413 And when it does,<br />this whole city's gonna come apart.
3000497 3002415 Okay, I don't wanna hear this.
3002499 3005126 This is the kind of pillow talk<br />that got that Russian girl disappeared.
3005210 3006461 What do you know about that?
3008087 3009255 Does anybody want a drink?
3009339 3010298 [Gil] I want a drink.
3010465 3011716 Keep him talking.
3014802 3015887 Wait, where are you going?
3015970 3017013 She knows Annika.
3017096 3018515 No, stay on the DA.
3018598 3020517 I told you I'm looking for my friend.
3022644 3024771 -Where's Annika?<br />-Out of my face. I don't know you.
3024854 3025897 Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?
3025980 3028525 -What have you heard? Is she okay?<br />-Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.
3028608 3029859 What, you got a death wish?
3029943 3032403 [man] Hey, what's the problem, ladies?
3032487 3035406 [Carla]<br />There's no problem. It's just girl talk.
3035490 3036991 Let's keep it festive down here,<br />all right?
3037075 3038159 [Carla] Sure thing, Oz.
3042914 3043957 Hey.
3044541 3045625 Hey.
3046793 3049963 Been a long time<br />since I seen you down here.
3051256 3052465 How you been?
3054801 3056511 Yeah, I've been okay.
3057845 3059222 I was just...
3061266 3063101 I was just headed back upstairs.
3063851 3064852 Well...
3065937 3067605 don't be a stranger.
3081703 3084080 -You know Carmine Falcone.<br />- I told you it's a mob spot.
3084163 3085748 You didn't tell me<br />you had a relationship with him.
3085832 3087625 I don't have<br />a relationship with him, okay?
3087709 3089544 -Well, that's not what it looked like.<br />-Forget it.
3089627 3090712 Wait, what are you doing?
3090795 3093214 -Listen, I can't do this anymore.<br />-No! No!
3093339 3094882 [line breaking up]
3095300 3096467 [static buzzes, stream stops]
3097802 3098803 [Selina] Taxi!
3099053 3100555 [heavy breathing]
3102765 3103766 [Gil] Hey!
3105476 3106561 I lost you in there.
3106644 3107729 Yeah, I gotta go.
3108605 3110023 Oh, you need a ride?
3110732 3112025 That's me right there.
3112317 3114277 [eerie music playing]
3118114 3119198 Taxi!
3119282 3120408 I'm good.
3122118 3123536 I hope, uh...
3128124 3129542 I'll see you around.
3129626 3130752 [car door closes]
3133504 3135381 [eerie music continues]
3144432 3146100 [car alarm chirps]
3163951 3165995 [glass squeaking]
3168081 3170249 [eerie music continues]
3179801 3181260 [breathes deeply]
3181594 3183054 [Gil grunts]
3183137 3184889 [train rumbles past]
3187684 3189769 [car horn blaring continuously]
3196025 3197068 [car horn stops]
3200488 3202323 [Gil grunting weakly]
3213584 3215670 -[Gil grunts]<br />-[Riddler shushes]
3216212 3220007 Just hold still.
3220842 3222677 -[beeping]<br />-[Gil whimpers]
3225096 3227348 [Riddler breathing heavily and raspily]
3228182 3230435 [eerie music continues]
3239068 3240403 [wistful music playing]
3275354 3276481 [switch clicks]
3278357 3279275 [Batman] What do you know about
3279358 3281652 a confidential informant<br />in the Maroni case?
3284739 3286449 Yeah, sure, there was.
3287158 3288993 That's the rat we're looking for.
3289911 3291788 Somehow Riddler knows who he is.
3292371 3295374 If we find the rat,<br />maybe it'll lead us to him.
3295458 3296918 Where are you getting this?
3297001 3299879 I have a source<br />who spoke to the DA tonight.
3300671 3302131 Gil's very nervous.
3303090 3305635 I think the killer's targeting<br />people close to that case.
3305718 3307595 I worked that case.
3307678 3309639 Riddler's not after you.
3309722 3310640 How do you know?
3311015 3312433 You're not corrupt.
3313476 3315019 Colson's dirty?
3320900 3322401 Maybe I, uh...
3323069 3326405 I go after him.<br />Lean on him to give up the rat.
3326489 3329784 It's too dangerous.<br />They made a secret deal with this guy.
3330535 3332328 Who knows how many people it touches.
3332411 3335623 Politicians. Police. The courts.
3336916 3338626 It could tear the whole city apart.
3339043 3341087 [Gordon] Jesus, this is a powder keg.
3342713 3344465 [Batman] And Riddler's the match.
3345341 3346509 [Batman on video]<br />You know Carmine Falcone.
3346592 3347885 [Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.
3347969 3349387 [Batman] You didn't tell me you had<br />a relationship with him.
3349470 3350972 [Selina] I don't have a relationship...
3351055 3351931 [video rewinds]
3352014 3353599 [Batman] You didn't tell me you had<br />a relationship with him.
3353683 3355351 [Selina] I don't have<br />a relationship with him. Okay?
3355476 3356394 [video rewinds]
3356477 3357937 [Batman] You know Carmine Falcone.
3358020 3359063 [Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.
3359146 3360773 [Batman] You didn't tell me<br />you had a relationship with him.
3360857 3362692 [Selina] I don't have<br />a relationship with him. Okay?
3362775 3364026 -[Alfred] Pretty.<br />-[tape clicks off]
3366028 3367405 She a new friend of yours?
3371993 3373202 I'm not so sure.
3374036 3375538 Looks like you upset her.
3376706 3378833 Shall I take this as a good sign?
3378916 3379917 What?
3380001 3380918 Your attire.
3381002 3383129 Is Bruce Wayne making<br />an actual appearance?
3383212 3385214 There's a public memorial<br />for Mayor Mitchell.
3385298 3387967 Serial killers like to<br />follow reactions to their crimes.
3389010 3390595 Riddler might not be able to resist.
3390678 3392138 Oh, that reminds me.
3393306 3397268 I've taken the liberty of doing<br />a little work on this latest cipher.
3397810 3399312 The one from the rat maze.
3399729 3402815 I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,
3403149 3405026 but I'm fairly certain<br />this translates to,
3405109 3408362 "You are El Rata Alada.”
3408988 3410406 [Bruce] Rata Alada?
3410489 3411699 "Rat with wings"?
3411782 3414285 It's slang for "pigeon."<br />Does that mean anything to you?
3414368 3415620 Yeah.
3417079 3418205 A stool pigeon.
3418456 3420082 Where are your cufflinks?
3420166 3421125 I couldn't find them.
3422585 3424545 Well, you can't go out like that.
3424629 3426422 Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.
3430593 3433387 You have to keep up appearances.<br />You're still a Wayne.
3433471 3434472 [scoffs]
3435097 3437308 And what about you? Are you a Wayne?
3438309 3440102 Your father gave them to me.
3442939 3444607 [gentle music playing]
3445858 3448986 [protesters chanting]<br />No more lies! No more lies!
3467171 3470132 Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,<br />you're going straight down there.
3474136 3475429 [melancholy music playing]
3476430 3478557 [protesters continue chanting]
3482687 3484438 [reporter] Is that Bruce Wayne?
3484522 3487149 [reporters] Mr. Wayne!<br />Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!
3487441 3490903 -[reporters clamoring]<br />-[camera shutters clicking]
3496242 3497243 [man] Hold it.
3498577 3499829 You good, fellas?
3500413 3501414 Good.
3503541 3504625 We're good, Mr. Falcone.
3505167 3507211 [melancholy music continues]
3522435 3523436 Sir?
3523769 3525312 [reporters continue clamoring]
3543122 3544081 [bodyguard] Hey!
3544165 3546167 Give us a wide berth here,<br />would you, slick?
3547126 3548961 Hey, watch it, fellas.
3549420 3551714 You got the prince of the city there.
3554550 3556385 Some event, huh?
3556469 3559430 Brought out the one guy in the city<br />more reclusive than me.
3559513 3561974 Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.
3562058 3563684 Aren't you afraid<br />someone'll take a shot at you?
3563768 3565770 Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?
3566645 3568064 Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?
3568689 3570149 Wow. Is that right?
3570232 3572276 His father saved my life.
3573235 3576447 I got shot in the chest. Right here.
3577656 3581160 I couldn't go to no hospital,<br />so we showed up on his doorstep.
3581452 3584663 Operated right on the dining room table.
3584747 3590002 Kid here, he saw the whole thing,<br />up on the stairs looking down.
3591420 3593422 I remember your face.
3595424 3597384 You don't think that meant something,<br />he did that?
3597760 3599887 It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.
3601222 3602807 "Hippocratic oath."
3605351 3606560 That's good.
3607103 3608270 Excuse me.
3609313 3610815 [laughs]
3611857 3612691 Yes.
3613234 3615569 ["Ave Maria" playing]
3617446 3619281 [indistinct radio chatter]
3621325 3623994 -[heavy breathing]<br />-[man coughing]
3626872 3627957 [announcer on mic] Ladies and gentlemen,
3628040 3629625 thank you all for<br />coming to today's memorial
3629708 3632086 for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.
3632169 3633963 Our program will begin shortly.
3634046 3635464 As a reminder, the family asked that
3635548 3636966 those wishing to honor<br />the mayor's memory
3637049 3638467 consider a donation to
3638551 3640594 -the cause most dear to his heart...<br />-[scuffling]
3640678 3642930 ...the Gotham Renewal Fund,
3643013 3644223 our city's safety net.
3644598 3647143 What good's a safety net<br />doesn't catch anybody?
3648227 3651981 Didn't help my daughter<br />when she needed it, I can tell you that.
3652064 3655276 The guy was just another<br />rich scum-sucker.
3656277 3658154 He got what he deserved.
3660072 3661073 Know what I mean?
3662366 3664493 Hey, don't I know you?
3664577 3665661 [woman] Bruce Wayne.
3666579 3668539 Why haven't you called me back?
3668622 3669623 I'm sorry?
3669915 3672251 I'm Bella Real. I'm running for mayor.
3672334 3673544 I wouldn't be bothering you here,
3673627 3676297 but your people keep telling me<br />you're unavailable.
3676380 3677715 Will you walk with me?
3679800 3681510 ['Ave Maria" continues playing]
3682887 3684221 Mr. Wayne.
3684305 3685514 Mr. Wayne.
3686223 3689310 You know, you really could be<br />doing more for this city.
3689894 3691729 Your family has<br />a history of philanthropy,
3691812 3694231 but as far as I can tell,<br />you're not doing anything.
3694315 3696775 If I'm elected, I want to change that.
3697359 3698652 Thank you.
3699528 3700529 [Bella] My God.
3702364 3704867 I'm gonna go pay my respects.<br />Will you wait for me?
3704950 3706577 I want to continue this.
3710789 3711665 Excuse me.
3713709 3715586 I'm so sorry for your loss.
3717796 3718714 Thank you.
3718797 3720549 [Gordon] Excuse me, chief.<br />Can I talk to you?
3721884 3723761 Gil Colson is missing.
3723844 3725137 [Mackenzie] What?
3725221 3727514 He hasn't been heard from<br />since last night.
3727598 3728641 Christ, not again.
3728724 3730809 Hey. Mr. Wayne.
3733103 3735147 You got people looking for him, Jim?
3735814 3738108 [Gordon] Sent a couple guys<br />to his house. Nothing.
3738192 3739109 [Mackenzie] What'd his wife say?
3739193 3740402 [Gordon] She hadn't heard from him.

3819773 3821358 Christ, it's Colson.
3821442 3823152 [officer]<br />There's a bomb around his neck!
3826280 3828324 -[cell phone ringing]<br />-[people gasp]
3828907 3830326 [whimpering]
3831118 3832411 [cell phone continues ringing]
3838208 3839752 Let's clear this place out now!
3839835 3841462 [officer 2]<br />We've got to get this place cleared out!
3841920 3843380 [people clamoring]
3843797 3845299 [cell phone continues ringing]
3855184 3856393 [cell phone ringing]
3856477 3857895 [whirring]
3871909 3873827 -[ringing continues]<br />-[camera shutter clicks]
3875704 3878457 [man] Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.
3878749 3880751 [sirens wailing]
3881460 3882878 [officer]<br />We don't know if he's in on it.
3886006 3887341 What's he looking at?
3887716 3889551 [cell phone ringing]
3891011 3892888 [distant footsteps]
3896141 3898560 [footsteps coming closer]
3898894 3901105 [ominous music playing]
3906110 3907444 Holy shit.
3908487 3910155 [Mackenzie] Are you kidding me?
3910239 3912991 What the hell is he doing? Gordon!
3913826 3916286 Your guy's gonna<br />get himself killed in there.
3917246 3919206 [cell phone continues ringing]
3932052 3933262 Please.
3933429 3936181 He made me do it.<br />[tearfully] I'm so sorry.
3936598 3938809 He told me if I didn't do exactly<br />what he said, he'd kill me.
3938892 3939893 I'm so sorry.
3940394 3942062 Looks like a combination lock.
3942146 3943605 Can't we just cut it off?
3944356 3946024 Not if you want to keep your head.
3949820 3951238 [cell phone continues ringing]
3976472 3978348 [Riddler breathing heavily]
3982728 3983979 [Riddler] You came.
3985814 3986899 Who are you?
3987441 3988442 Me?
3990861 3992446 I'm nobody.
3993906 3996325 I'm just an instrument,
3996408 4000704 here to unmask the truth<br />about this cesspool we call a city.
4001246 4002331 "Unmask"?
4002414 4003582 Yes.
4004416 4007252 Let's do it together, okay?
4007336 4009755 I've been trying to reach you.
4010422 4012758 You're part of this too.
4012841 4014635 How am I a part of this?
4014718 4016637 You'll see.
4016720 4018472 [officer] Hey, Chief.<br />You better take a look at this.
4018555 4020641 [Riddler on stream]<br />Say hello to my followers.
4020724 4021975 We're live.
4022059 4025062 They're here to watch our little trial.
4026271 4027439 Al the moment,
4027523 4030901 the man across from you, Mr. Colson,
4030984 4032027 is dead.
4032110 4034112 Jesus, can we get somebody out here?<br />This psycho's gonna kill me!
4034196 4035155 But wait a minute...
4035239 4038367 [shouting] Shut up! You deserve<br />to be dead after what you did!
4038450 4041453 You hear me?
4041537 4042538 [softly] Okay.
4043080 4044706 [Riddler groaning comically]
4047167 4048752 [Riddler laughing]
4051296 4053382 [Riddler] I'm giving you a chance.
4055133 4057302 No one ever gave me a chance.
4059346 4060389 Now,
4061390 4064184 ever since I was a child,
4064268 4067854 I've always loved little puzzles.
4068438 4070857 For me, they are a retreat
4070941 4074278 from the horrors of our world.
4074361 4079575 Maybe they can bring<br />some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.
4079658 4081910 -You want me to do puzzles?<br />-[chuckles excitedly]
4081994 4084746 Three riddles in two minutes.
4084830 4088917 You give me the answers,<br />and I'll give you the code for the lock.
4089001 4091336 -Do you understand?<br />-Yeah.
4091420 4093589 Okay, okay. So I just...
4093672 4094756 -You want me to...<br />-[device beeps]
4094881 4097217 -[whimpers]<br />-Riddle number one...
4097301 4100929 -[timer beeping]<br />-"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,
4101013 4105684 but when it's denied,<br />it's violence you may find."
4105767 4108186 Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?
4108270 4109354 "Cruel"? "Poetic"?
4109438 4110856 -"Justice."<br />-Huh?
4110939 4111982 The answer's "justice."
4112065 4113275 -Justice?<br />-Yes!
4113358 4114943 -Oh, God.<br />-Justice!
4115027 4119364 [dramatically] And you were supposed<br />to be an arm of justice in this city,
4119448 4121825 along with the late mayor<br />and police commissioner,
4121908 4124286 were you not, Mr. Colson?
4124369 4125579 Of course, of course. Of course.
4125662 4128040 Riddle number two.
4128123 4132252 "If you are justice, please do not lie.
4132336 4136506 What is the price for your blind eye?”
4136590 4138383 -"The price"?<br />-[Batman] "Bribes."
4138467 4139718 Oh, God. "Bribes"?
4139801 4141970 He's asking you how much it cost<br />for you to turn your back.
4142054 4143305 [hesitating]
4143388 4144514 [shouting] Fifty-eight seconds!
4144598 4145849 -How much?<br />-Nothing!
4145932 4148143 -[raises voice] How much?<br />-Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.
4148226 4150520 I get a monthly payment<br />just not to prosecute certain cases.
4150604 4151438 What cases?
4151521 4152648 He didn't ask me that!
4152731 4153732 -Come on! Ten grand.<br />-[Riddler laughing]
4154191 4157152 -That's my answer. It's ten grand!<br />-Okay. Okay. Okay.
4157235 4159863 Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.
4159946 4163784 Just one more to go<br />before your time runs out.
4163867 4166286 [singsongy] Last riddle.
4166370 4170707 [dramatically]<br />"Since your justice is so select,
4170791 4175087 please tell us which vermin<br />you're paid to protect.”
4175170 4177255 -"Which vermin"?<br />-[Batman] The rat.
4177339 4179883 The informant you all protect<br />from the Salvatore Maroni case.
4179966 4181760 -How do you know about that?<br />-What's his name?
4181843 4183053 Twenty seconds.
4183136 4184805 -No.<br />-He's gonna kill you.
4184888 4186848 I'm a dead man either way.<br />You're talking to a dead man, okay?
4186932 4188475 If I go out this way, it's just me.
4188558 4191687 But if I give over that name,<br />I have family, people I love.
4191770 4193230 -He'll kill them too.<br />-Who will?
4193313 4194648 -People are watching.<br />-What people?
4194731 4196858 It's so much bigger<br />than you could ever imagine.
4196942 4199111 -It's the whole system!<br />-Five!
4199194 4200070 -Four!<br />-[beeping rapidly]
4200153 4201530 -Oh, God, have mercy on me...<br />-Three!
4201613 4203490 -Goodbye!<br />-[device trills]
4203699 4204574 [Batman grunts]
4206868 4208829 [people gasp]
4210247 4211998 [ears ringing]
4213625 4215210 [muffled, indistinct shouting]
4226680 4228557 [ringing intensifies]
4230767 4231768 [ringing stops]
4233687 4235063 [Martinez]<br />Who do you think he is under there?
4235147 4235981 [Gordon] Take it easy.
4236064 4237065 [Martinez] I want to see.
4238400 4239609 [medic] What is that thing? Leather?
4243363 4244823 [medic 2] What's he got on his eyes?
4244906 4246366 [Martinez] Who cares?<br />I want to see his face.
4246450 4247659 What are we doing here?<br />Let's just take it off...
4247743 4248910 -[Gordon] Hey!<br />-[officers clamoring]
4249494 4252622 Hey! Hey! Hey!
4252706 4254374 Relax, God damn it!
4254458 4255959 You're protecting this guy, Jim?
4257377 4259921 He interfered in<br />an active hostage situation.
4260005 4262424 Colson's blood is on his hands.
4262507 4263925 Maybe it's on yours.
4265385 4266428 What'd you say?
4266511 4268096 He would rather die than talk.
4268680 4270182 What was he afraid of?
4270932 4272017 You?
4272309 4273518 [menacing music playing]
4279149 4280567 You son of a bitch.
4281151 4284154 You have any idea<br />what kind of trouble you're in?
4284237 4285947 You could be an accessory to murder.
4286031 4287032 [officer] Why are we playing games...
4287157 4288825 [officers clamoring]
4289159 4290035 [Officer 2] Get him! Come on!
4290118 4292120 <i>Back off! Back off!</i>
4292204 4294498 Great, now I got you<br />on assaulting an officer!
4294581 4296666 -You got me on assaulting three.<br />-Hey!
4296750 4299544 What's the matter with you?<br />This isn't the way to do this!
4299920 4301671 [breathing heavily]
4302214 4303757 You too now?
4303840 4306384 Let me handle this, Chief.<br />Just give me a minute.
4306468 4309054 You're gonna put yourself on the line<br />for this scumbag, Jim?
4309137 4311389 Just give me a minute.<br />I'll get him to cooperate.
4314184 4315685 Okay, give him the room.
4331326 4332619 Two minutes.
4344381 4345966 You listen to me.
4347551 4349553 [softly] We gotta get you out of here.
4351221 4353181 That would put a lot of heat on you.
4353265 4354933 Well, you punched me in the face.
4356017 4357102 [Batman scoffs]
4357185 4358478 Take this key.
4359771 4363149 Through that door. Hallway to the stairs<br />that go to the roof.
4364192 4365902 [Kenzie] Hey, what the hell<br />is going on here?
4366903 4369197 Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?
4369614 4371867 [suspenseful music playing]
4372576 4374953 Who's the mustache with the broken nose?
4378373 4381084 That's Kenzie. Narcotics.
4381167 4384087 He's one of the guys I got into it with<br />at the Iceberg Lounge.
4385005 4387632 What are you saying?<br />Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?
4390343 4392304 Or he moonlights as a cop.
4396892 4398393 -[officer] Jesus Christ!<br />-[Kenzie] Go!
4398476 4399978 [officer 2] Somebody stop him!
4400562 4402439 [officers clamoring]
4404065 4405400 [tense music playing]
4427172 4428548 [gasping]
4430425 4431801 [grunts]
4438183 4439726 -[officer 1] There he is!<br />-[officer 2] Freeze!
4442395 4444314 [heroic music playing]
4459037 4460080 [grunting]
4464709 4466211 [groaning]
4486106 4488024 [Gordon] Could have at least<br />pulled that punch, man.
4488566 4489776 I did.
4489859 4493238 Bock put out an APB on you.<br />You really think he's in on this?
4493321 4495365 I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?
4495448 4496574 I only trust you.
4496658 4498994 What's a narcotics cop doing<br />with Falcone's right-hand man?
4499077 4502455 Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."<br />Maybe Kenzie's part of it.
4503206 4504332 You think Penguin's the rat?
4504416 4507460 His club caters to the mob.<br />Maroni practically lived there.
4507544 4509504 Penguin would have been<br />privy to a lot of dirt.
4509587 4510922 DA was a regular too.
4511006 4514509 Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam<br />and working a deal was his only way out.
4515593 4516803 The Rata Alada.
4516886 4517846 The what?
4517929 4519389 Riddler's latest.
4519472 4521182 The cipher in the maze.
4521266 4523768 It means "a rat with wings."<br />Like a stool pigeon.
4525353 4526980 A penguin's got wings too.
4528982 4530942 Time for me<br />to have another conversation with him.
4531026 4532694 What about the Riddler?<br />He's gonna kill again.
4532777 4535989 It's all connected.<br />Like it or not, it's his game now.
4536072 4539242 You want to find Riddler,<br />we gotta find that rat.
4539492 4540994 [thunder rumbling]
4541870 4543705 [Gordon on radio]<br />Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.
4544873 4545957 [Batman] There's Penguin.
4546041 4547917 [Gordon] I wonder what's in the bags.
4549544 4550795 You want to move in?
4552672 4554132 [Batman] Let's follow.
4554799 4557052 [suspenseful music playing]
4562223 4563433 [car horn honking]
4572650 4576196 They stopped at Waterfront Street.<br />The recycling plant.
4576321 4577572 [Batman] I'm here.
4578990 4580658 -[Penguin] How you doing?<br />-[man] Yeah, good. How are you?
4580742 4583244 [Penguin] Good, good.<br />Let's get in out of this deluge.
4584704 4586748 [conversation continues indistinctly]
4588583 4590335 [suspenseful music continues]
4602472 4605016 It's a drug lab. Drops.
4605100 4606309 This is a buy.
4606392 4609562 Looks like they got Maroni's operation<br />up and running again.
4609646 4610814 Or they never shut it down at all.
4610897 4611773 [Gordon] What are you saying?
4611856 4614984 The biggest drug bust in GCPD history<br />was a fraud?
4615276 4616945 [motorcycle approaching]
4617695 4619697 [suspenseful music continues]
4639342 4640760 This just got complicated.
4641511 4642679 What do you mean?
4646850 4648226 [twin 1 grunts]
4648601 4650061 Hey! What happened?
4650145 4651479 You all right?
4653481 4654607 [grunts]
4662198 4663992 Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.
4664117 4665743 [sighs] Jesus.
4666494 4668329 Is this how you get your kicks, hon?
4668830 4670165 Sneaking up on girls in the dark?
4670248 4671958 Is that why you work in the club?
4672709 4673751 It was all just a score?
4673835 4677630 I would love to sit and go over<br />every gory detail with you, bat boy...
4679007 4680925 but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

5106142 5108769 -Who's the Riddler?<br />-Riddler? How should I know?
5108853 5110146 [Gordon] Let's make it easy for you, Oz.
5110229 5111647 Cops caught you doing something.
5111731 5113357 They were gonna shut you down,<br />put you away.
5113441 5115318 So you gave up a bigger fish<br />to save your ass.
5115401 5117528 You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.
5117612 5118821 His drops operation.
5118904 5121365 But the cops, the city officials,<br />the mayor, the DA,
5121449 5125077 they got greedy, right?<br />Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.
5125161 5126912 They wanted to take over<br />the drops business too,
5126996 5129332 but they needed a minor league mope<br />like you to run it.
5129415 5132627 You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.<br />You work for them too.
5132710 5133878 What are you, crazy?
5133961 5135046 [Gordon] That why you killed the girl?
5135129 5136088 I didn't kill no girl!
5136172 5137965 We know she worked for you<br />at the 44 Below.
5138049 5139342 But she got too close, right?
5139425 5141636 Found out from Mitchell that you were<br />the rat, so you killed her.
5141719 5143679 But somehow Riddler found out too.
5143763 5145681 He knows so much about you.
5145765 5147808 -You must know about him.<br />-Who is he?
5148392 5150603 Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.
5151020 5152188 Why don't you start harmonizing?
5152521 5155191 There's only one problem<br />with your little scenario, okay?
5155274 5156609 I ain't no rat!
5156692 5158527 You got any idea what Carmine Falcone<br />would do to me
5158611 5159695 if he heard this kind of talk?
5159779 5161947 Oh, you don't wanna<br />talk about rats, huh?
5162031 5164575 Maybe we can talk about<br />what they did to my partner's face.
5164659 5166202 Holy God, what are you showing me here?
5166285 5167912 -This was around his head!<br />-Come on!
5167995 5169914 [yells] Open your eyes!
5173834 5175419 Are you El Rata Alada?
5175503 5177004 El Rata Alada?
5177088 5178923 Yeah, a "rat with wings."<br />A stool pigeon.
5179006 5181342 That's not you?<br />The symbols in the maze, right here.
5181425 5184011 It says you are El Rata Alada.
5184095 5185471 "You are El Rata"? It says that?
5185554 5186764 Why, you got something to tell us?
5186847 5187723 Yeah!
5188391 5189433 It's, like, the worst Spanish<br />I ever heard.
5189517 5190351 What?
5190768 5192103 It's "La."
5192186 5193479 "La” rata.
5193979 5195981 What, is this Riddler stupid<br />or something?
5196065 5197942 Jesus! Look at you two.
5198359 5200611 World's greatest detectives!
5201028 5203322 Am I the only here knows the difference<br />between "ell” and “"la”?
5203406 5204490 Jesus!
5204573 5206075 No habla espariol, fellas?
5206158 5208160 Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!
5209578 5210663 You think he made a mistake?
5210746 5211956 He doesn't make mistakes.
5212039 5213082 A rat with wings?
5213165 5214750 You know what that sounds like to me?
5214834 5218003 A friggin' bat! Huh?<br />You ever think of that?
5218087 5220089 "You are El Rata.”
5225720 5229598 "You are el.”
5238274 5239775 Maybe it was a mistake.
5240192 5241026 Maybe he isn't as smart as--
5241110 5241944 -[computer beeps]<br />-Wait.
5245364 5246699 Is that him?
5247575 5249410 -[beeps]<br />-Holy shit.
5250411 5251245 [typing]
5269305 5270890 What the hell does that mean?<br />Is he or isn't he?
5300294 5303923 "I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.
5304006 5306842 But in a mansion, in a slum,
5306926 5308844 I'll never know where I come from.
5309720 5311055 Do you know what I am?"
5311138 5312139 Any idea?
5312681 5313682 Yeah.
5315100 5316352 It's an orphan.
5325236 5326987 A mansion in a slum.
5328531 5331116 -He's talking about the old orphanage.<br />-The one that burned down?
5331200 5332910 It was part of the Wayne estate.
5333536 5335120 They donated it<br />after they built the tower.
5335204 5336038 Let's go.
5339291 5341752 You guys realize I'm still here, right?
5342795 5344171 You gonna untie me?
5344255 5345714 How the hell<br />am I supposed to get out of here?

5459703 5461497 and that's why I'm here today.

5603597 5607351 It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.<br />We found this too.

5797874 5799626 How could they do that to her?
5799710 5801670 That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.
5801753 5803672 Her body was in his car.
5803755 5806633 I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna<br />make him pay. You gonna help me?
5806717 5809720 -Help you?<br />-Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."
5809803 5811346 Your friend got involved<br />with the wrong people.
5811430 5813056 She didn't know any better.
5813140 5814474 Maybe you should have<br />explained it to her.
5814558 5816101 What the hell is that supposed to mean?
5816184 5817686 It means your choices have consequences.
5817769 5820147 Jesus Christ. "Choices"?
5820230 5822941 You know, whoever the hell you are,<br />you obviously grew up rich.
5823025 5824860 -Was it worth it?<br />-What?
5825193 5827362 Compromising yourself for money?
5828739 5830991 What did you have to do<br />to set up that score?
5832617 5836288 How close did you have to get<br />to Penguin? To Falcone?
5836371 5837706 You don't know<br />what the hell you're talking about.
5837789 5839124 Falcone owes me that money.
5839207 5840959 -He owes you?<br />-Yeah, and a lot more.
5841043 5841877 Oh, really? Why's that?
5841960 5842878 You know what? I can't even talk to you.
5842961 5844713 No! I want to know<br />why a guy like Falcone
5844796 5845797 would owe you anything.
5845881 5848216 [shouts]<br />Because he's my father!
5857351 5860145 My mother worked at the 44 Below.
5861646 5862939 Just like Anni.
5865108 5867652 She used to take me there<br />when I was a little girl.
5869738 5871073 To the club?
5871990 5872991 Yeah.
5875702 5878580 I hid out in the dressing room<br />while she worked.
5879039 5880791 Used to see him there.
5881541 5883543 He scared the shit out of me.
5885504 5888965 And I could never understand<br />why he looked at me the way he did.
5889508 5893345 Then one night,<br />my mother told me who he was.
5896723 5899059 When I was seven,<br />my mother was murdered.
5899726 5901228 Strangled.
5901645 5905107 Never found out who.<br />Probably some creep from the club.
5906983 5909069 Anyway, social services<br />came to take me away,
5909152 5911321 and he didn't say a thing.
5913156 5914950 Couldn't even look at me.
5918703 5920455 He owes me that money.
5922249 5923667 I'm sorry.
5924793 5925961 For what I said.
5927337 5928755 Oh, it's all right.
5929464 5930382 [chuckles dryly]
5932300 5934386 You assume the worst in people.
5935303 5936680 Which, well...
5938974 5940892 maybe we're not so different after all.
5946356 5948108 Who are you under there?
5954197 5956074 What are you hiding?
5958452 5960287 Are you just...
5961872 5963582 hideously scarred?
5965709 5966710 Yeah.
5967669 5969004 [chuckles lightly]
5973967 5975385 Listen to me.
5976928 5979806 If we don't stand up for Annika,<br />no one will.
5980974 5985645 All anyone cares about in this place<br />are these white, privileged assholes.
5986271 5989357 The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.
5989441 5990692 Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.
5990775 5992027 I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
5992110 5994154 that psycho's right<br />to go after these creeps.
5994237 5995489 I think you'd be on his side.
5995572 5997199 What do you mean,<br />"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?
5997282 5999242 What, do you live in a cave?
5999326 6001411 The Riddler's latest.<br />It's all about the Waynes.
6002496 6006374 Listen, if I can find<br />that dick bag Kenzie,
6006458 6007667 will you help me?
6008919 6010212 Please.
6013006 6014925 Come on, Vengeance.
6017385 6019638 Just don't make any moves without me,<br />understand?
6019721 6021348 It's a little more dangerous<br />than you know...
6021640 6023558 [romantic music playing]
6030899 6032442 I told you, baby.
6034361 6036947 I can take care of myself.
6047749 6051044 [Thomas] I'm Thomas Wayne,<br />and I approve this message.
6051294 6053296 [triumphant music playing]
6058885 6062472 From a very young age, my family,<br />Martha's family, the Arkhams...
6062597 6064432 ...instilled in both of us
6064641 6067060 that giving back<br />is not just an obligation,
6067227 6068687 it's a passion.
6069396 6071731 That is our family's legacy.
6072941 6075277 [Riddler on TV]<br />The Waynes and the Arkhams.
6075360 6077821 Gotham's founding families.
6077904 6081074 But what is their real legacy?
6082409 6087080 Twenty years ago, one reporter set out<br />to uncover the dark truth.
6087163 6090834 He found shocking family secrets.
6091543 6093086 How, when Martha was just a child,
6093169 6095672 her mother brutally murdered her father,
6095755 6097382 -then committed suicide...<br />-[gunshot]
6097465 6103054 ...and how the Arkhams used their power<br />and money to cover it up.
6103138 6107809 How Martha herself was<br />in and out of institutions for years
6107892 6110270 and they didn't want anyone to know.
6111104 6113607 Thomas Wayne tried<br />to force this crusading reporter
6113690 6117611 into a hush-money agreement<br />to save his mayoral campaign.
6117736 6119779 [raises voice]<br />But when the reporter refused...
6120280 6124576 ...Wayne turned to longtime<br />secret associate Carmine Falcone
6124659 6127245 [laughs hysterically]<br />and had him murdered!
6127370 6130415 -[gunshot]<br />-The Waynes and the Arkhams,
6130999 6136254 Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.
6136755 6139132 I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.
6139215 6141593 This is your legacy too.
6141676 6145138 And Gotham needs you to answer
6145221 6148016 [whispering]<br />for the sins of your father.
6149559 6151394 Goodbye.
6153355 6155273 [club music playing on speakers]
6157150 6158234 Do you know who I am?
6159861 6160987 You're Bruce Wayne.
6161071 6162947 I wanna see Carmine Falcone.
6173708 6174709 See?

6176753 6177629 [elevator bell dings]
6178546 6180048 [romantic old song playing on speakers]
6184803 6185929 [billiard balls clatter]
6186012 6188640 [Falcone] Who is this guy<br />who invented the ball, right?
6189391 6191518 Must have made a fortune.
6191976 6193728 If you think about it,<br />the concept of it, right?
6195230 6197691 Briscoe, do you know<br />how much this sweater cost?
6197774 6198775 [Briscoe] No, boss.
6198858 6201194 [Falcone] $1,183.
6201778 6203738 You know why communism failed, right?
6203822 6204823 [Briscoe] No, boss.
6206741 6207992 [Falcone] Austerity.
6208201 6209244 [men laugh]
6210245 6211871 [Penguin] All right. All right.
6212163 6214541 [Falcone chuckles]<br />Look at that. Perfect.
6214624 6216376 [Penguin]<br />It's never gonna be that good again.
6218586 6221089 Hey, Johnny Slick.
6221172 6222340 What are you doing here?
6224259 6226094 Give us a moment here, fellas.
6227011 6228054 [Penguin] Come on.
6229973 6231182 See ya, champ.
6232183 6233435 Come on, sweetheart.
6235395 6236396 Have a seat.
6238440 6240233 I thought I might hear from you.
6241401 6244529 This, uh,<br />Riddler son of a bitch is really...
6246072 6247866 stirring things up, huh?
6247949 6249659 -Is it true?<br />-What?
6250952 6252579 That reporter business?
6253913 6255123 What do you want to know here, kid?
6255206 6258001 Did you kill him? For my father?
6258084 6260837 Look, your father was in trouble.
6261713 6263506 This reporter had some dirt.
6263590 6265216 Some very...
6266384 6270138 personal stuff about your mother,<br />her family history.
6270221 6272932 Everybody's got their dirty laundry,<br />that's just how it is.
6273016 6274476 But he didn't want<br />none of it coming out,
6274559 6276478 not right before the election.
6276936 6279230 And your father tried<br />to pay the guy off,
6279314 6280940 but he wasn't going for it.
6281024 6284194 So, he came to me.
6284277 6286654 Well, I never seen him like that.
6287489 6289324 He said, "Carmine,
6290116 6294829 I want you to put the fear of God<br />in this guy."
6297248 6300168 And when fear isn't enough...
6300835 6302670 Oof. Hmm.
6304005 6307342 Your father wanted me to handle it,<br />so I did.
6308343 6310178 I handled it.
6311888 6313306 I know.
6313389 6315642 You thought your father was a Boy Scout.
6316893 6318728 But you'd be surprised
6318812 6321189 what even a good man like him
6321272 6323858 is capable of in the right situation.
6326110 6327570 Do me a favor.
6327904 6329948 Don't lose any sleep over it.
6330657 6332242 This reporter
6333076 6334661 was a lowlife.
6334744 6336204 He was on Maroni's payroll.
6337831 6339457 -Maroni?<br />-Oh, yeah.
6340208 6343461 He could never stand<br />your father and I had history.
6344879 6348383 And after what happened<br />with that reporter, Maroni was worried
6348466 6350802 that your father would be in my pocket,
6351553 6352554 forever.
6353221 6355265 He would have done anything
6355348 6357517 to keep him from becoming mayor.
6357600 6358935 You understand?
6360144 6364691 Are you saying Salvatore Maroni<br />got my father killed?
6364774 6366818 Do I know it for a fact?
6369237 6371322 I'm just saying,<br />it sure looked that way to me.
6372699 6374993 This is what you wanted, huh?
6375076 6377495 This little conversation here?
6377996 6379414 [exhales ruefully]
6379914 6382083 It's been a long time coming, huh?
6384711 6386838 I mean, you ain't a kid no more.
6390300 6392385 [melancholy music playing]
6436512 6438473 [EKG machine beeping]
6441935 6443603 [inhales sharply]
6448858 6450610 [rain pattering]
6453404 6454489 [sighs]
6456240 6457533 You lied to me...
6460370 6461996 my whole life.
6467168 6469212 I spoke to Carmine Falcone.
6472298 6475593 He told me what he did for my father.
6479597 6481099 About Salvatore Maroni.
6483101 6485812 He told you Salvatore Maroni...
6485895 6487647 Had my father killed.
6490108 6492318 Why didn't you tell me all this?
6495071 6499617 All these years<br />I've spent fighting for him,
6499701 6502036 believing that he was a good man.
6502120 6503705 He was a good man.
6504872 6506582 You listen to me.
6506666 6510086 Your father was a good man.
6513715 6515633 -He made a mistake.<br />-A "mistake."
6515717 6517635 He had a man killed.
6517719 6518803 Why?
6519971 6523224 [sighing] To protect his family image?
6524308 6525560 His political aspirations?
6525643 6529188 It wasn't to protect the family image,<br />and he didn't have anyone killed.
6531774 6533317 He was protecting your mother.
6534277 6537822 He didn't care about his image<br />or the campaign, any of that.
6537905 6540033 He cared about her,
6540116 6541409 and you,
6541492 6544412 and in a moment of weakness,<br />he turned to Falcone.
6544495 6547957 But he never thought Falcone<br />would kill that man.
6548833 6552170 Your father should have known<br />that Falcone would do anything
6552253 6555381 to finally have something on him<br />that he could use.
6555465 6557300 That's who Falcone is.
6559552 6561763 And that was your father's mistake.
6561846 6563890 But when Falcone<br />told him what he'd done,
6563973 6566726 your father was distraught.
6567602 6570813 He told Falcone<br />he was going to the police,
6570897 6573066 that he would confess everything.
6574567 6576569 And that night,
6576652 6580573 your father and your mother were Killed.
6582992 6585161 [soft music playing]
6586079 6587830 It was Falcone?
6592335 6593795 [smacks lips]
6593878 6596005 Oh, I wish I knew for sure.
6600718 6604263 Or maybe it was some random thug<br />on the street
6604347 6607100 who needed money, got scared,<br />and pulled the trigger too fast.
6607183 6612396 If you don't think I've spent every day<br />searching for that answer...
6614148 6618027 It was my job to protect them.<br />Do you understand?
6618694 6620488 I know you always blamed yourself.
6620571 6623116 You were only a boy, Bruce.
6625284 6627578 I could see the fear in your eyes,
6628996 6631374 but I didn't know how to help.
6631457 6633960 I could teach you how to fight, [sighs]
6635336 6638005 but I wasn't equipped<br />to take care of you.
6638089 6639924 You needed a father.
6641884 6644303 And all you had was me.
6646681 6647890 I'm sorry.
6649642 6651561 Don't be sorry, Alfred.
6658359 6659443 God.
6662488 6666909 I never thought<br />I'd feel fear like that again.
6669620 6671747 I thought I'd mastered all that.
6678171 6679422 I mean,
6680631 6682758 I'm not afraid to die.
6684510 6686888 I realize now there's something
6688014 6689891 I haven't got past.
6690808 6692560 This fear...
6695021 6697982 of ever going through any of that again.
6702236 6704447 Of losing somebody I care about.
6705781 6708075 [soft music continues]
6732391 6734101 [soft dramatic music playing]
6737104 6738773 [engine revving]
6755039 6755998 Hey.
6756082 6758834 I saw the signal. That's not you?
6758918 6760836 I thought it was you.
6765007 6766384 [both grunting]
6773766 6775309 - I found him!<br />- I see that.
6775393 6776894 He had my shit and my phone.
6776978 6778187 She left a message<br />the night they took her.
6778271 6779188 She called me...
6779272 6780982 Gordon! Help me out, man!
6781065 6782358 She got my gun!
6782608 6783609 [grunts]
6783693 6785403 -Shut up!<br />-Put the gun down.
6786946 6789490 I'm telling you, God damn it!<br />She called me!
6794078 6796163 -[cell phone beeps]<br />-Here. Listen.
6798124 6799792 [Kenzie on recording]<br />Hey! Get back here!
6799917 6802086 -[Annika whimpering]<br />-Where you going? Come back here!
6802169 6804255 [Falcone] Hey, hey,<br />what are you doing, Kenzie?
6804338 6805673 You're scaring her.
6805756 6807466 [Kenzie] I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.
6807550 6808592 [Annika, tearfully]<br />Please, please, please.
6808676 6809969 Please, don't hurt me, please.
6810052 6812722 [Falcone]<br />Hey, don't be scared. Come here.
6814598 6816642 Now let me ask you again.
6817351 6819895 -What did Mitchell tell you?<br />-[Annika] No, nothing. He...
6819979 6822898 [Falcone] Don liked to talk.<br />I know that.
6822982 6825693 Especially to pretty girls like you.
6826235 6828237 That's why I made him<br />take your passport...
6828946 6831824 until we could have<br />this little conversation.
6831907 6834618 [Annika] All I want to do<br />is get out of here, okay?
6834702 6836829 You'll never hear from me again,<br />nobody will. Please, please...
6836912 6840041 [Falcone] We're gonna get you<br />out of here, I promise.
6840875 6843419 But first, I gotta know...
6844503 6845838 What did he tell you?
6846630 6850176 [Annika] He just said<br />they all made a deal with you.
6850676 6851886 [Falcone] Oh. Hmm.
6851969 6853929 He told you about that, huh?
6854013 6855306 The deal.
6855389 6860311 [Annika] He said you gave some<br />information on some drops thing
6860394 6863105 and that's how he became mayor.
6863189 6865566 He said you were a very important man.
6865649 6866776 [Falcone] Right.
6867526 6868903 Mm-hmm.
6869862 6872031 Hmm. Okay.
6874116 6875868 -[tussling on recording]<br />-[Annika screams]
6876827 6878329 -[Annika cries]<br />-[tussling continues]
6879705 6881040 -[Falcone] Just take it easy.<br />-[Annika choking]
6881123 6882666 Jesus, he's strangling her.
6882750 6885795 [Falcone] Take it easy.
6887922 6889340 [recording stops]
6895012 6896305 Rata Alada.
6901060 6902853 A falcon has wings too.
6903187 6905022 Falcone is the rat?
6915991 6919161 Falcone works for you guys?
6919829 6922373 The mayor? The DA?
6925376 6926460 No.
6926794 6928295 [breathing shakily]
6929547 6930840 We work for him.
6931841 6933092 Everybody does.
6933175 6934176 How?
6934260 6935845 Through Renewal.
6936637 6938013 Renewal is everything.
6938097 6939432 -The Renewal Fund?<br />-[Kenzie] Yeah.
6940015 6943727 After Thomas Wayne died,<br />they all went after it like vultures.
6943811 6947398 The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.<br />Everyone got in on it.
6947481 6950860 It was perfect for making bribes,<br />laundering money.
6950943 6953028 A huge charitable fund<br />with no oversight.
6953112 6954822 Everybody got a piece.
6954905 6956740 But Falcone wanted more.
6958534 6961745 So he orchestrated a play<br />to take Maroni down big.
6963164 6965499 He'd rat out his drops operation,
6965875 6968586 make the careers of everybody<br />that went after him,
6968669 6971130 then install them all as his puppets.
6971213 6973757 You think this goddamn election matters?
6975384 6977303 Falcone's the mayor.
6978262 6980764 He's been the mayor<br />for the last 20 years.
6980848 6982224 Come on, Vengeance.
6982933 6984768 Let's go kill that son of a bitch.
6985478 6987104 -This creep too. Let's finish this.<br />-Oh, God!
6987188 6988022 No!
6988147 6989148 [gun clatters]
6989482 6990691 We'll get him.
6991358 6993235 -But not that way.<br />-There is no other way!
6993319 6994445 He owns the city!
6994528 6995779 Cross that line...
6996572 6997865 you'll become just like him.
6998574 7000117 Listen to me.
7000201 7002077 Don't throw your life away.
7008626 7010002 Don't worry, honey.
7013088 7014548 I got nine of 'em.
7014673 7016634 -[screams]<br />-[Gordon] No, don't! Hey, hey!
7017927 7019220 [Kenzie] Oh, God! [whimpering]
7028521 7029647 [Gordon]<br />She won't get out of there alive.
7029813 7032399 And if she kills Falcone,<br />we may never find the Riddler.
7032483 7033484 I have to stop her.
7033651 7034610 Don't you mean "we"?
7035945 7037488 I gotta do this my way.
7037821 7038822 And then what?
7039698 7041075 We do what Riddler said.
7041909 7043536 Bring the rat into the light.
7046539 7048457 [dramatic music playing]
7052169 7053879 [engine roaring]
7079488 7081532 Can you tell Mr. Falcone<br />I'd like to come up?
7081615 7083075 He ain't seein' nobody tonight.
7083701 7085035 Tell him it's about Annika.
7088289 7089623 Hey!
7090457 7091875 Look who it is, huh?
7091959 7094378 -Sorry to bother you.<br />-Nah. It's fine, beautiful.
7094461 7096463 I was just hoping<br />I could talk to you for a minute?
7096630 7098090 Absolutely.
7099842 7100843 Alone?
7101468 7102469 [banging on door]
7104346 7106390 [muffled club music playing]
7117401 7118485 Hey!
7118777 7120487 [club music playing on speakers]
7129038 7130247 [tearfully] I'm just so worried.
7130331 7131957 I don't know where she is.
7133709 7137087 And I know<br />that you're a very important man.
7137171 7140591 I was hoping that maybe<br />you could help me find her...
7142092 7144470 because she's been gone so long,<br />I'm beginning to...
7144637 7145846 [inhales shakily]
7145929 7147056 I'm sorry. [sniffling]
7147264 7148349 It's okay.
7148432 7150559 -I'm so sorry.<br />-I understand. Here.
7150726 7153604 No, that's okay, I have a tissue.
7157858 7158776 Mr. Falcone?
7158859 7160319 Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?
7160402 7163322 I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think<br />you're gonna want to see this.
7165699 7167201 [Falcone] I'm sorry, beautiful.
7167284 7168702 I'll be right back.
7174833 7176543 [dramatic music playing]
7183092 7183926 [indistinct TV chatter]
7184009 7185094 Holy shit.
7185177 7186845 [newscaster]<br />That recording, provided to GC-1
7186929 7189640 by Lieutenant James Gordon<br />of the Gotham PD.
7189723 7192559 And we should warn you,<br />the contents are extremely graphic
7192643 7194853 and some of you may find it disturbing.
7195479 7198982 [Annika, tearfully] He just said<br />they all made a deal with you.
7199108 7200651 [Falcone] Oh. Hmm.
7200818 7202486 He told you about that, huh?
7202569 7204071 The deal.
7204154 7208951 [Annika] He said you gave some<br />information on some drops thing
7209034 7211954 and that's how he became mayor.
7212037 7214581 He said you were a very important man.
7214665 7215666 [Falcone] Right.
7216542 7217751 Hmm.
7217835 7219044 Okay.
7220754 7222589 -[tussling on recording]<br />-[Annika screams]
7226301 7228679 [newscaster] Revelations of<br />Mr. Falcone's secret role

7230597 7231849 Hey, Dad.
7232891 7233892 What?
7234351 7236395 I'm Maria Kyle's kid.
7238021 7239481 You remember her?
7241525 7242568 Yeah.
7246864 7247948 Just put down the gun, honey.
7248031 7249116 This is for my mother.

7379872 7381665 Just like your mother.
7382457 7383792 [Falcone grunts]
7387671 7389006 He has to pay!
7392926 7394052 You don't have to pay with him.
7394720 7396555 [Selina gasping]

7434968 7437679 Look at you, man.<br />What do you think this is?
7437763 7440849 You think you're gonna scare me<br />with that mask and that cape?
7440933 7442184 I'm gonna start crying,
7442267 7444770 and all of a sudden,<br />some big secret's comin' out?
7444853 7446480 Let me tell you something.
7446563 7448273 Whatever I know,
7448357 7450233 whatever I've done,
7450317 7454655 it's all going with me to my grave.
7465207 7467167 What, are you with Zorro over here?
7468794 7471088 Don't you know you boys in blue<br />work for me?
7479012 7481348 [Gordon]<br />I guess we don't all work for you.
7481515 7482975 [indistinct radio chatter]
7490357 7491900 You have the right to remain silent.
7492734 7496238 Anything you say can and will<br />be used against you in a court of law.
7496321 7497656 You have the right to an attorney.
7497739 7498907 If you cannot afford one,
7498991 7500784 the City of Gotham<br />will provide one to you.
7500867 7502577 Do you understand these rights?
7504079 7505664 Do you understand?
7507624 7508709 [Falcone] Yeah.
7508792 7510877 I'll see you when I walk out.
7510961 7511962 [Gordon] With these rights in mind,
7512045 7513338 is there anything else<br />you wish to tell...
7513422 7514673 Goddamn rat.
7516633 7517968 What'd you say?
7518051 7519803 Enjoy your night at Black gate, Carmine.
7520929 7522180 Probably be your last.
7522431 7525475 Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?
7525559 7526643 Maybe I am.
7526727 7527936 Really, Oz?
7528020 7532733 Because to me, you were always<br />just a gimp in an empty suit.

7672831 7673957 [Martinez]<br />Lieutenant, we got a witness here,
7674040 7676710 says she saw someone coming down<br />the fire escape right after the shot.
7676793 7679254 She said he went into the corner diner.
7679337 7682257 The guy's sitting by himself<br />at the counter, right now.

7820312 7822022 What are all these diaries?
7822105 7824524 They're ledgers. He's got thousands.
7824607 7828153 He scrawled all over 'em.<br />Rambling, ciphers, codes.
7828236 7829779 Got something back on one of the IDs.
7829863 7832157 Edward Nash ton. Works at KTMJ.

7836661 7838413 What about chain of evidence?
7839247 7840457 You should see this.
7846421 7847922 He's wearing gloves.
7849382 7851634 "Friday, July 16th.
7851718 7855430 My life has been a cruel riddle<br />I could not solve,
7855764 7858808 suffocating my mind, no escape.
7858892 7860310 But then, today, I saw it.
7860393 7864522 A single word on this ledger,<br />sitting on the desk beside me.
7865857 7867650 'Renewal.'
7867734 7872155 The empty promise they sold to me<br />as a child in that orphanage.
7872238 7875367 One look inside,<br />and finally I understood.
7875450 7878787 My whole life<br />has been preparing me for this.
7878870 7881331 The moment when I would learn the truth.
7881414 7884417 When I could finally strike back<br />and expose their lies."
7885543 7887379 -[rats squeaking]<br />-"If you want people to understand,
7887462 7889297 really understand,
7889381 7891674 you can't just give them the answers.
7891758 7893218 You have to confront them,
7893301 7895720 torture them<br />with the horrifying questions,
7895804 7897972 just like they tortured me.
7898056 7900850 I know now what I must become."

7921871 7922914 [screeching violently]
7931881 7933007 [Gordon] What is that?
7935718 7937220 [bat screeching frantically]
7964622 7965832 [officer] Some kind of pry tool?
7965915 7967292 Is it a chisel?
7967375 7968835 [Batman] It's a murder weapon.
7968918 7970295 He killed Mitchell with it.
7970962 7973840 The edge will match the floorboard<br />impression in the mayor's study.
7982432 7984434 "My confession"?
7984517 7987395 What's he confessing to?<br />He already told us he killed Mitchell.
7987479 7988855 This isn't over.
7988938 7991357 [officer 2] Oh, man. He's been posting<br />all kinds of shit online.
7991774 7993985 He's got, like, 500 followers.<br />Real fringe types.
7994360 7995653 [typing]
8002076 8004287 His final post was last night.
8004370 8007582 Some video. Got a lot of views,<br />but it's password-protected.
8007665 8010668 -[Gordon] Can you get in?<br />-[officer 2] Copying his drive now.
8010793 8014214 Take some time, but we'll get in.

8029729 8031439 [Gordon] "The Truth Unmasked."
8032273 8033900 I think I'm his last target.
8036486 8037570 You?
8037946 8039989 Maybe this is all coming to an end.
8040532 8041908 What is?
8042367 8043785 The Batman.
8044035 8045203 [cell phone ringing]
8049165 8050333 Yeah?
8061636 8062845 Right.
8065723 8069686 Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.
8077151 8078653 You're a good cop.
8103261 8105638 [over speaker]<br />I told you I'd see you in hell.
8106389 8108224 [Batman] What do you want from me?
8108308 8109851 [Riddler] "Want"?
8110435 8114063 If only you knew how long<br />I've been waiting for this day.
8115273 8116608 For this moment.
8117650 8120653 I've been invisible my whole life.
8121738 8124365 I guess I won't be anymore, will 1?
8125908 8128328 They'll remember me now.
8128411 8130246 They'll remember both of us.
8140632 8142592 Bruce...
8145470 8147305 Wayne.
8149682 8153436 [slowly] Bruce...
8154854 8157732 Wayne.
8163488 8164530 [exhales deeply]
8168993 8171412 You know, I was there that day.
8173998 8177377 The day the great Thomas Wayne<br />announced he was running for mayor,
8177460 8179837 made all those promises.
8182298 8186552 Well, a week later he was dead,<br />and everybody just forgot about us.
8187095 8190640 All they could talk about<br />was poor Bruce Wayne.
8190723 8194394 Bruce Wayne, the orphan.
8194977 8196521 Orphan.
8202193 8207323 Living in some tower over the park<br />isn't being an orphan.
8208616 8213246 Looking down on everyone,<br />with all that money.
8213913 8215456 Don't you tell me.
8218084 8220753 Do you know what being an orphan is?
8221129 8223715 It's 30 kids to a room.
8225007 8229053 Twelve years old and already a drop head,<br />numbing the pain.
8230763 8235435 You wake up screaming<br />with rats chewing your fingers.
8236602 8239772 And every winter one of the babies die
8239856 8242150 because it's so cold.
8243443 8246028 But oh, no.
8247321 8248573 [smacks lips]
8248948 8252118 Let's talk about the billionaire<br />with the lying, dead daddy
8252201 8255121 because at least the money<br />makes it go down easy.
8255204 8256205 Doesn't it?
8257665 8259709 Bruce...
8260752 8262670 Wayne.
8266340 8269427 He's the only one we didn't get.
8272847 8275975 But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?
8277435 8281314 All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.
8284484 8285651 God.
8286652 8287945 Look at you.
8289614 8292074 Your mask is amazing.
8292158 8295077 I wish you could've seen me in mine.
8295161 8296245 Ain't it funny?
8296329 8300750 All everyone wants to do is unmask you,<br />but they're missing the point.
8302210 8304253 You and I both know
8305213 8307715 I'm looking at the real you right now.
8307799 8311427 My mask allowed me<br />to be myself completely.
8311511 8313054 No shame,
8313971 8314972 no limits.
8315056 8316724 Why did you write me?
8317600 8318601 What do you mean?
8318684 8320394 All those cards.
8320478 8321687 I told you,
8322396 8324315 we've been doing this together.<br />You're a part of this.
8324398 8326609 -We didn't do anything together.<br />-We did.
8326692 8328152 What did we just do?
8328236 8330238 I asked you to bring him into the light,<br />and you did.
8330321 8331489 We're such a good team.
8331572 8332573 We're not a team.
8332657 8335159 I never could have<br />gotten him out of there.
8335243 8337662 I'm not physical.<br />My strength is up here.
8337745 8340915 I mean, I had all the pieces,<br />I had the answers.
8340998 8342625 But I didn't know<br />how to make them listen.
8342708 8343918 You gave me that.
8344001 8345127 I gave you nothing.
8345211 8347797 You showed me what was possible.
8347880 8352760 You showed me all it takes is fear<br />and a little focused violence.
8352844 8354387 You inspired me.
8354470 8355972 You're out of your goddamn mind.
8357098 8358182 What?
8358266 8360434 This is all in your head.<br />You're sick, twisted.
8360518 8361894 How can you say that?
8361978 8363479 You think you'll be remembered?
8363563 8365231 You're a pathetic psychopath,
8365731 8367483 -begging for attention.<br />-No.
8367567 8369235 -You're gonna die alone in Arkham.<br />-No.
8369318 8370361 No, no!
8370444 8371362 A nobody!
8373155 8374949 No!
8376868 8379245 Ahhh!
8379495 8382081 This is not how this was supposed to go!
8383040 8386669 Ahhh!
8386752 8389380 I had it all planned out!
8390381 8392383 We were gonna be safe here.
8392758 8396053 We could watch the whole thing together.
8396137 8397138 Watch what?
8397221 8398973 Everything!
8400725 8402143 [tense music playing]
8407315 8408983 It was all there.
8411152 8413487 You mean, you didn't figure it out?
8414655 8415865 [Riddler gasps slowly]
8417783 8421704 Oh, you're really not as smart<br />as I thought you were.
8423748 8425833 I guess I gave you too much credit.
8426292 8427543 What have you done?
8428252 8433132 What's black and blue and dead all over?
8435968 8437803 You.
8439472 8441599 If you think you can stop<br />what's coming...
8442934 8444477 What have you done?
8446020 8451859 [sings in falsetto]<br />Ave Maria
8452276 8454153 [shouting] What have you done?
8456614 8457990 Gratia plena
8458157 8459575 What have you done?
8460201 8461285 [growls]
8463579 8466958 Maria
8467124 8472672 Gratia plena
8477718 8479178 [suspenseful music playing]
8504537 8505913 [Martinez] Hey!
8506914 8508207 What are you doing in here?
8526142 8528728 Hey, man, I don't think that<br />you should be touching that.
8532231 8533190 [bottles clink]
8535317 8537778 Boy, this guy's a real nut job, huh?
8538654 8541407 Killing Mitchell<br />with a friggin' carpet tool.
8546078 8549123 My uncle's a... He's an installer.
8549206 8551375 You know, it's a... Oh, you know.
8551459 8553711 It's a tucker.
8554045 8555713 [suspenseful music continues]
8571520 8572521 Huh.
8587703 8590498 Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!<br />What are you doing?
8590581 8592083 What are you doing?
8601050 8602635 [suspenseful music builds up]
8606639 8608307 [dramatic music playing]
8622613 8624031 [Riddler] Hey, guys.
8624365 8626575 Uh, thanks for all the comments
8626659 8629620 and a special thanks to everyone<br />for the tips on detonators.
8629703 8630704 Detonators?
8630788 8635835 I just want to say this will be my last<br />post for a little while, and, uh...
8638087 8640172 what this community has meant to me
8640256 8643259 these weeks, these months,
8644176 8646595 let's just say none of us...
8648305 8650432 is alone anymore. Okay?
8651142 8652226 Jesus.
8652518 8653561 [Riddler huffing]
8655563 8656564 [inhales deeply]
8656689 8659275 Tomorrow's Election Day.
8659441 8661068 [laughing]
8661861 8664488 And Bella Real will win.
8664572 8667199 She promised real change.
8667908 8670286 But we know the truth, don't we?
8670369 8672454 You've seen Gotham's true face now.
8672538 8674415 Together, we've unmasked it.
8674498 8677459 Its corruption, its perversion
8677543 8681380 masquerading under the guise of renewal.
8681463 8685301 But unmasking is not enough.
8687511 8691515 The day of judgment is finally upon us.
8691599 8693976 [in playful tone] And now it is time
8695060 8697438 for retribution.
8697521 8700316 I've parked seven vans
8700608 8702943 all along the city seawall.
8704153 8706030 And on the big night,
8706113 8708365 [whispers] they will go boom.
8712119 8713829 [dramatic music playing]
8719251 8720669 [explosion]
8722630 8723881 -[explosion]<br />-[inaudible] Boom!
8729136 8730596 -[explosion]<br />-[inaudible] Boom!
8733265 8735517 When the vans blow,
8735601 8741232 the flooding will happen so fast,<br />evacuation will not be an option.
8741565 8744526 Those who are not washed away
8744610 8747613 will race through the streets in terror.
8747780 8748781 -[panicked screams]<br />-Call Gordon.
8748864 8750991 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
8752576 8754203 -[crowd cheering]<br />-[Riddler] As breaking news
8754286 8756205 hits higher ground<br />in Gotham Square Garden...
8756330 8759291 ...celebrations will turn to panic,
8759375 8764213 as the venue becomes<br />the city's shelter of last resort.
8764296 8765464 [sirens wailing]
8765589 8769593 And that's where all of you come in.
8776016 8779311 Now, when the time arrives,<br />I will already be unmasked.
8779395 8781563 The pigs will have me in their custody,
8781647 8783691 but that's okay.
8783774 8788279 Because then it will be your turn.
8788362 8792241 You'll be there, waiting.
8792449 8794243 [dramatic music playing]
8803294 8806213 It's time for the lies to finally end.
8806297 8810426 [dramatically]<br />False promises of renewal?
8810509 8811593 Change?
8812011 8815806 We'll give them real, real change now.
8815889 8820894 We've spent our lives in this<br />wretched place, [shouts] suffering!
8821353 8823856 Wondering, "Why us?"
8823939 8827067 Now they will spend<br />their last moments wondering,
8827151 8829320 [screams] why them?
8829403 8831447 I can't get through! The lines are down.
8832781 8834074 [sirens wailing]
8837077 8839246 Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!
8839830 8841457 I'm just trying to get out of town, man!
8841540 8844418 Lady, we got bombs going off.<br />The whole city's flooding.
8844501 8846462 You're gonna have to go inside<br />the Garden with everyone else.
8846545 8847588 [distant explosion]
8848005 8849631 [people screaming]
8851592 8852676 [crowd clamoring]
8853635 8854553 [sirens wailing]
8856096 8857765 -Lieutenant, who's in charge?<br />-I really don't know.
8857848 8859350 We're just trying<br />to get a handle here, sir.
8859433 8861268 Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!
8861352 8862603 We got an active situation.
8862728 8864021 We need to sweep the building<br />for explosives
8864104 8865314 and get the mayor-elect<br />out of here, now.
8865397 8866315 -Where is she?<br />-I can take you there.
8866398 8867232 Come!
8867316 8868609 [crowd chattering]
8870235 8871320 [tense music playing]
8903268 8904686 -[man] If we don't close the doors...<br />-MCU.
8904770 8905646 ...we're gonna have huge problems.
8905729 8907106 The water's already started to breach.
8907189 8908732 I thought this was<br />a shelter of last resort.
8908816 8911026 [man] Yeah, for a hurricane,<br />but not if the whole seawall comes down.
8911110 8912945 [Bella] I am not gonna let<br />those people die out there.
8913028 8915364 All right. I'll go calm down the crowd<br />SO we can get everyone in.
8915447 8917699 It's not safe for you here.<br />We need to get you out, Ms. Real.
8917783 8920035 -I'm not going anywhere.<br />-We're under attack, ma'am.
8920119 8921954 Exactly! That's the problem<br />with this city.
8922037 8925040 Everyone's afraid to stand up<br />and do the right thing, but I'm not.
8925124 8926625 -Excuse me.<br />-Ma'am...
8931797 8935259 Everyone, everyone,<br />if I could just get your attention.
8935342 8937636 Please! I just need your attention!
8940431 8941348 [gasps]

9517966 9520260 [Bruce] Wednesday, November 6th.
9520427 9522095 [siren wattling in distance]
9523471 9525348 The city is underwater.
9527684 9529436 The National Guard is coming.
9531730 9533732 Martial law is in effect...
9534649 9536276 but the criminal element never sleeps.
9539487 9543199 Looting and lawlessness will be rampant
9543283 9545827 in the parts of the city<br />no one can get to.
9546995 9550707 I can already see things will get worse<br />before they get better.
9553668 9556796 And some will seize the chance<br />to grab everything they can.
9558173 9559549 [Bella] We will rebuild.
9560175 9561634 But not just our city.
9562343 9566556 We must rebuild people's faith<br />in our institutions,
9566639 9568725 in our elected officials,
9568808 9570101 in each other.
9570894 9574230 Together, we will learn<br />to believe in Gotham again.
9574397 9575356 [woman speaks indistinctly]
9575607 9576900 [helicopter blades whirring]
9578568 9580236 [Bruce] I'm starting to see now.
9581696 9583865 I have had an effect here...
9585950 9587869 but not the one I intended.
9590246 9593291 Vengeance won't change the past,
9594626 9597003 mine or anyone else's.
9599422 9601466 I have to become more.
9604552 9606179 People need hope.
9607388 9609599 To know someone's out there for them.
9613394 9615063 The city's angry,
9615980 9617357 scarred,
9618274 9619526 like me.
9621653 9623738 Our scars can destroy us.
9625115 9627826 Even after<br />the physical wounds have healed.
9629452 9631204 But if we survive them,
9632705 9634582 they can transform us.
9636459 9638378 They can give us the power
9639337 9640839 lo endure...
9642215 9644342 and the strength to fight.
9647262 9649430 [reporter]<br />We are live. As you can see,
9649514 9652308 the masked vigilante<br />atop Gotham Square Garden
9652392 9653977 helping to save the lives
9654060 9655687 -of hundreds of victims.<br />-[Riddler moaning]
9655770 9658773 And now as first responders desperately<br />scramble to help the injured,
9658857 9661401 a mysterious masked man emerges,
9661484 9663820 heroically pulling the victims<br />right through that skylight...
9663903 9666364 [man] Isn't that just terrible?
9667740 9669659 Him...
9669742 9672620 raining on your parade like that?
9672787 9673913 [tutting]
9678334 9680336 What is it they say?
9681504 9683673 "One day you're on top,
9685216 9686885 the next...
9688261 9690180 you're a clown."
9690847 9692223 [exhales ruefully]
9692557 9693725 Well,
9695518 9698354 let me tell you,<br />there are worse things to be.
9698563 9699647 [Riddler weeping]
9700648 9703318 Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.
9704611 9706446 You did so well.
9710950 9711951 And you know,
9713620 9716831 Gotham loves a comeback story.
9726883 9728259 [Riddler] Who are you?
9728801 9731221 [man] Well, that's the question,
9732472 9733640 isn't it?
9736559 9738937 Riddle me this...
9741397 9743524 "The less of them you have,
9744275 9748112 the more one is worth."
9753534 9755286 A friend.
9759415 9760833 [laughing maniacally]
9766798 9769008 [both laughing maniacally]
9781521 9782522 -[Batman] You're leaving.<br />-[gasps]
9783439 9784524 [Selina] Jesus.
9786276 9787860 Don't you ever just say hello?
9790405 9791364 [cat meows]
9792949 9794367 Where will you go?
9795868 9798288 I don't know. Upstate.
9798705 9800415 Bludhaven, maybe.
9801291 9802292 Why?
9803501 9804711 You asking me to stay?
9811759 9813886 You know this place<br />is never gonna change.
9814304 9816639 With Carmine gone,<br />it's only gonna get worse for you.
9816723 9818641 There's gonna be a power grab.
9820268 9821394 It'll be bloody.
9822020 9823229 I know.
9824772 9825857 But the city can change.
9825940 9827191 It won't.
9828318 9829319 I have to try.
9829402 9831195 It's gonna kill you eventually.<br />You know that.
9833489 9834615 Listen.
9837035 9838286 Why don't you come with me?
9839245 9840747 Get into some trouble.
9841497 9845001 Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.<br />It'll be fun.
9845668 9847295 The bat and the cat.
9848796 9850465 It's got a nice ring.
9862060 9863102 [scoffs]
9863811 9865229 Who am I kidding?
9866689 9868816 You're already spoken for.
9870735 9872612 [soft music playing]
9880703 9882121 You should go.
9890463 9891464 Selina...
