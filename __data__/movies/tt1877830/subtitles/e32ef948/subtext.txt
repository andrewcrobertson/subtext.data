5110294 5111711 Cops caught you doing something.
5111795 5113421 They were gonna shut<br />you down, put you away.
5113505 5115382 So you gave up a bigger<br />fish to save your ass.
5115466 5117582 You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.
5117676 5118882 His drops operation.
5118969 5121429 But the cops, the city<br />officials, the mayor, the DA,
5121513 5125131 they got greedy, right?<br />Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.
5125225 5126977 They wanted to take over<br />the drops business too,
5127061 5129396 but they needed a minor<br />league mope like you to run it.

5139490 5141700 Found out from Mitchell that<br />you were the rat, so you killed her.

5158676 5159759 if he heard this kind of talk?
5159843 5162005 Oh, you don't wanna talk about rats, huh?

6238505 6240291 I thought I might hear from you.
6241467 6244585 This, uh, Riddler<br />son of a bitch is really
6246138 6247924 stirring things up, huh?
6248015 6249722 -Is it true?<br />-What?
6251018 6252634 That reporter business?
6253979 6255188 What do you want to know here, kid?
6255272 6258060 Did you kill him? For my father?
6258150 6260892 Look, your father was in trouble.
6261779 6263565 This reporter had some dirt.
6263655 6265271 Some very
6266450 6270193 personal stuff about your<br />mother, her family history.
6270287 6272997 Everybody's got their dirty<br />laundry, that's just how it is.
6273081 6274541 But he didn't want none of it coming out,
6274625 6276536 not right before the election.
6277002 6279289 And your father tried to pay the guy off,
6279379 6280995 but he wasn't going for it.
6281089 6284252 So, he came to me.
6284343 6286710 Well, I never seen him like that.
6287554 6289386 He said, "Carmine,
6290182 6294892 I want you to put the<br />fear of God in this guy."
6297314 6300227 And when fear isn't enough…
6300901 6302733 Oof. Hmm.
6304071 6307405 Your father wanted<br />me to handle it, so I did.
6308408 6310240 I handled it.
6311954 6313365 I know.
6313455 6315696 You thought your father was a Boy Scout.
6316959 6318791 But you'd be surprised

6327970 6330007 Don't lose any sleep over it.
6330722 6332304 This reporter
6333141 6334723 was a lowlife.
6334810 6336266 He was on Maroni's payroll.
6337896 6339512 -Maroni?<br />-Oh, yeah.
6340274 6343517 He could never stand<br />your father and I had history.
6344945 6348438 And after what happened with<br />that reporter, Maroni was worried
6348532 6350864 that your father would be in my pocket,
6351618 6352608 forever.
6353287 6355324 He would have done anything
6355414 6357576 to keep him from becoming mayor.
6357666 6358997 You understand?
6360210 6364750 Are you saying Salvatore<br />Maroni got my father killed?
6364840 6366877 Do I know it for a fact?

6460435 6462051 My whole life.
6467234 6469271 I spoke to Carmine Falcone.
6472364 6475652 He told me what he did for my father.
6479663 6481153 About Salvatore Maroni.
6483166 6485874 He told you Salvatore Maroni…
6485961 6487702 Had my father killed.
6490173 6492380 Why didn't you tell me all this?
6495137 6499677 All these years I've<br />spent fighting for him,
6499766 6502098 believing that he was a good man.
6502185 6503767 He was a good man.
6504938 6506645 You listen to me.
6506732 6510145 Your father was a good man.
6513780 6515691 -He made a mistake.<br />-A "mistake."
6515782 6517693 He had a man killed.
6517784 6518865 Why?
6520037 6523280 [SIGHING] To protect his family image?
6524374 6525625 His political aspirations?
6525709 6529259 It wasn't to protect the family image,<br />and he didn't have anyone killed.
6531840 6533376 He was protecting your mother.
6534342 6537880 He didn't care about his image<br />or the campaign, any of that.
6537971 6541468 He cared about her, and you,
6541558 6544471 and in a moment of<br />weakness, he turned to Falcone.
6544561 6548020 But he never thought<br />Falcone would kill that man.
6548899 6552233 Your father should have known<br />that Falcone would do anything
6552319 6555437 to finally have something<br />on him that he could use.
6555530 6557362 That's who Falcone is.
6559618 6561825 And that was your father's mistake.
6561912 6563955 But when Falcone told him what he'd done,
6564039 6566781 your father was distraught.
6567667 6570876 He told Falcone he<br />was going to the police,
6570962 6573124 that he would confess everything.
6574633 6576624 And that night,
6576718 6580632 your father and your mother were killed.
6583058 6585220 [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING]
6586144 6587885 It was Falcone?

6600784 6604322 Or maybe it was some<br />random thug on the street

6618760 6620546 I know you always blamed yourself.
6620637 6623174 You were only a boy, Bruce.
6625350 6627637 I could see the fear in your eyes,
6629062 6631429 but I didn't know how to help.
6631523 6634015 I could teach you how to fight, [SIGHS]
