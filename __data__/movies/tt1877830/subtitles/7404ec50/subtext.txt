116826 119412 [Newscaster on TV]<br />A dark and stormy Halloween.
119870 122373 [News jingle plays on TV]
123499 126419 Good evening and welcome to<br />60-1 news live at 8:00.
126502 128045 Our top story tonight,
128129 130464 just-released polls have<br />incumbent mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.
130548 134385 And 28-year-old grassroots challenger<br />Bella real in a dead heat.
134468 135970 Things certainly got hot last night
136053 139515 in their final debate<br />before next Tuesday's election.
139598 143644 Now, my young opponent here wants to<br />gut the Gotham renewal program,
143728 145479 established by the great Thomas Wayne.
145563 148316 Cutting funds from vital projects<br />like our sea wall
148399 149918 and the safety net<br />for those who need it.
149942 154113 The renewal program is broken.<br />This city's been renewing for 20 years.
154196 156991 Look where it's gotten us.<br />Crime has skyrocketed.
157074 158510 Murder and drug use<br />are at historic highs.
158534 159452 Now wait... now hang on.
159535 161787 We have a masked vigilante<br />running the street.
161871 162913 Under my administration,
162997 166792 the Gotham pd has dealt major blows<br />to organized crime and drug trafficking.
166876 170379 The Salvatore maroni case was<br />the biggest drug bust in city history.
170463 172757 But drops and other drugs<br />are still rampant.
172840 173840 It's gotten worse.
173883 175235 I'm not saying there isn't work to do.
175259 176278 - But listen...<br />- [Phone rings]
176302 177779 I have a beautiful<br />wife and young son, okay?
177803 179263 - And I will not rest...<br />- [Mutes TV]
181599 182892 [Picks up phone]
183768 184769 Hey.
185186 186645 [Low eerie music playing]
187229 188939 Yeah, I'm watching it now.
189148 190691 [TV muted]
194278 195821 Why is she still tied?
200409 203412 But I thought we were getting<br />a bump in the new post poll.
210503 212922 Okay, you know what?<br />I can't watch this anymore.
213005 214882 Just call me in the morning, okay?
214965 215966 [Phone beeps]
218094 220572 [Don on TV] ...Who still believes in<br />everything this city can do.
220596 223140 [Bella] We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,<br />not a cheerleader.
223224 225893 And someone who will<br />tell the people the truth.
226018 227311 [Applause on TV]
227436 228479 [Switches TV off]
235653 237113 [Masked man yells]

267268 272565 [Breathing deeply and heavily]
304680 307683 [Bruce] Thursday, October 31st.
308476 309560 [Crackling]
317568 319778 [Car horns honking]
320529 323282 The city streets are crowded<br />for the holiday.
326452 328120 Even with the rain.
328871 330873 [Chatter and laughter]
331624 335085 Hidden in the chaos is the element,
336003 338088 waiting to strike like snakes.
339590 341091 But I'm there too.
342134 343844 Watching.
345429 349850 Two years of nights have turned me<br />into a nocturnal animal.
355231 358025 I must choose my targets carefully.
361362 362988 [Suspenseful music playing]
368661 370746 - [Indistinct TV chatter]<br />- [Entry bell chimes]
371664 373642 - [Gunman] Come on! Give me the money.<br />- [Cashier] Okay.
373666 376293 - [Gunman] Let's go! Let's go!<br />- [Cashier] All right, all right!
376377 377878 [Bruce] It's a big city.
382508 384218 I can't be everywhere.
387888 389139 - [Rowdy laughter]<br />- [Grunts]
390516 391892 [Cheers and laughter]
394812 396730 But they don't know where I am.
401902 403654 - [Laughter]<br />- Look at this guy, man.
408993 409993 Boom!
410119 411161 [Gang] Whoo-hoo-hoo!
414915 416810 [Gang member 1] So good, man.<br />That's what I'm talking about!
416834 418434 [Gang member 2] Yo, let's see your hits.
419086 420462 That's you.
421380 423465 [Tense music playing]
440941 444862 [Bruce] We have a signal now.<br />For when I'm needed.
446572 448824 But when that light hits the sky,
449700 451702 it's not just a call.
453287 454830 It's a warning.
456624 457625 To them.
461795 463047 [Helicopter blades whirring]
467343 468552 Fear...
469595 471263 [Uneasy music playing]
471889 473682 Is a tool.
482566 484401 - [Tires screech]<br />- [Car horn blares]
484777 487946 [Driver] Are you out of your mind?<br />Watch where you're goin', drophead!
499792 502336 [Bruce]<br />They think I'm hiding in the shadows.
502544 503962 [Heroic music playing]
504088 505214 [Sirens wailing]
505297 506298 [Thug] Come on!
514723 516642 [Bruce] But I am the shadows.
522189 523691 [Brakes screech]
528529 529530 [Pa chimes]
529613 531448 [Indistinct announcement on pa]
535411 537571 - [Gang leader] Come on, come on.<br />- [Gang member] Whoo!
538372 539516 - Hey, go on, man! Go!<br />- Get him!
539540 540999 - Come on, man!<br />- What are you doin'?
541959 543210 - [Man] Help!<br />- [Gang laughs]
543293 544503 Somebody help me!
545295 547297 Help, help!
549800 551218 [Gang jeering]
552970 554096 [Ganglaughs]
554179 555573 [Gang member 1]<br />Where you goin', huh?
555597 557141 [Gang member laughing derisively]
560185 561185 Come on.
561228 562896 Come on, man. Break it.
565065 566483 You can't move, huh?
566859 568569 Now knock his ass out.
568652 570362 Showtime. Showtime, man.
570904 571989 Come on, man.
572072 573323 Come on. Do it, man.
574533 576201 [Muffled clanging]
576910 579121 - [Menacing music playing]<br />- [Footsteps approaching]
585043 587212 [Footsteps coming closer]
606148 608233 [Laughing]
608650 610277 You see this guy?
617493 619119 The hell are you supposed to be?
625834 627252 [Gang leader grunting]
630756 631799 [Water splashes]
636136 637429 I'm vengeance.
638555 640474 Holy shit. It's him.
647231 648690 [Yelps]
652236 653946 [Gang grunting]
659076 660160 [Chokes]
660452 661495 [Grunting]
666166 667292 Hey, man. No, no, no!
672172 673715 [Groaning]
706331 707958 [Man breathing raggedly]
709042 710419 Please don't hurt me.
722180 724182 [Soft music playing]
732274 734109 [Hushed chatter]
746455 748040 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
749416 750834 Police action.
751418 753086 He's with me, officer.
755339 756924 Are you kidding me, sir?
757841 759593 You're gonna let him in here?
760260 763055 Martinez, let him through.
765974 767517 [Martinez sighs]
776693 778445 Goddamn freak.
794336 795420 What do we know?
806264 807641 Detective?
807724 809351 Sorry, lieutenant.
810227 814731 We got blunt force trauma.<br />Lacerations on the head.
815482 818652 He got hit a lot of times. And hard.
821822 823448 All this blood is from his head?
829246 830455 Excuse me.
832749 834626 Most of it's from his hand.
840090 841133 Thumb was severed.
842759 844970 Killer may have taken it as a trophy.
845345 847264 [Batman]<br />He was alive when it was cut off.
848557 849975 Ecchymosis...
851226 852769 Around the wound.
867993 869703 [Lead detective]<br />Security detail downstairs
869786 871997 said the family was out<br />trick-or-treatin'.
873498 875709 The mayor was up here alone.
878128 880839 Killer may have come<br />through the skylight.
887220 889014 [Gordon] You said there was a card.
889097 890682 [Lead detective] Yeah.
900817 903862 [Gordon] "From your secret friend. Whoo?
905155 906865 Haven't a clue?
906948 909326 Let's play a game, just me and you.
910368 912913 What does a liar do when he's dead?"
914247 916333 There's a cipher too.
923090 924966 Any of this mean anything to you?
927511 928720 What's going on here?
931807 933225 I asked him to come, Pete.
933308 934976 [Pete] This is a crime scene.
935060 937395 It's Mitchell, for Christ sakes!
937479 939481 I got the press downstairs.
939564 942317 You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,<br />'cause we got history.
942400 944236 But this is way over the line.
947906 948990 Wait.
949074 950843 - He's involved in this?<br />- No, he's not involved.
950867 951993 How do you know?
952077 955080 He's a goddamn vigilante!<br />He could be a suspect!
955163 956974 What are you doin' to me?<br />We used to be partners.
956998 958684 [Gordon] I'm just trying<br />to find the connection, Pete.
958708 960252 He lies still.
961753 962754 Excuse me?
964297 965382 The riddle.
965966 969386 What does a liar do when he's dead?<br />He lies still.
978520 980021 Oh, Jesus.
983275 986069 This must be your favorite night<br />of the year, huh, pal?
987070 988905 Happy fuckin' Halloween.
989698 991324 [Martinez] Excuse me, commissioner.
992409 994077 They're ready for your statement.
998123 999833 I want him outta here.
1000458 1001543 Now!
1008133 1009342 Come on.
1013597 1014764 [Camera shutter clicking]
1022147 1023356 Yeah.
1024608 1026026 The kid found him.
1031031 1034034 [Detective] Was there anyone else<br />in the house when you arrived?
1034284 1036369 [Melancholy song playing]
1050467 1052636 We really gotta go, man.
1058225 1061937 [Pete] Tonight, a son lost a father.
1062395 1064231 A wife lost a husband.
1065440 1066983 And I lost a friend.
1068068 1070612 Mayor Mitchell<br />was a fighter for the city,
1070695 1073782 and I will not rest<br />until his killer is found.
1074241 1076409 This was a truly senseless crime,
1077160 1080580 and we are actively pursuing<br />every investigative lead we have
1080664 1084751 in order to identify the perpetrator<br />and hunt him down.
1084834 1086086 I've spoken to the governor...
1086169 1089005 [Bruce] I wish I could say<br />I'm making a difference,
1089089 1090674 but I don't know.
1091091 1093426 [Melancholy song continues]
1096596 1099474 Murder, robberies, assault.
1099557 1101643 Two years later, they're all up.
1102394 1103728 And now this.
1105897 1107482 The city's eating itself.
1110193 1111444 Maybe it's beyond saving.
1113530 1115824 But I have to try.
1116616 1117867 Push myself.
1118159 1120328 [Melancholy song continues]
1135885 1137429 [Engine revving]
1149149 1150567 [Bats chittering]
1163955 1166458 These nights all roll together in a rush
1167417 1169336 behind the mask.
1173840 1176134 Sometimes in the morning,
1177927 1180096 I have to force myself to remember
1182474 1184059 everything that happened.
1185060 1186436 [Groaning]
1198615 1200259 [Newscaster on TV] Unbelievable<br />breaking news this hour, everyone.
1200283 1204162 Again, four-term incumbent<br />Gotham mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.
1204245 1207082 Was found murdered last night<br />inside his home
1207165 1208917 in the exclusive crest hill district.
1209000 1210668 [Newscaster 2]<br />Exact details of the crime
1210752 1212253 still have not been released,
1212337 1215215 but a citywide manhunt<br />is already unden/vay
1215298 1218551 as police and FBI search<br />for the brazen killer.
1218676 1220470 And this certainly is not the first time
1220553 1223098 Gotham has been rocked by<br />the murder of a political figure.
1223181 1227435 In fact, in an eerie coincidence,<br />it was 20 years ago this week
1227519 1229270 that celebrated<br />billionaire philanthropist
1229354 1231314 Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha
1231398 1234234 were slain during Wayne's<br />own mayoral campaign.
1234317 1238154 It was a shocking crime<br />that remains unsolved to this day.
1238238 1240031 Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career
1240115 1242784 was especially notable<br />for his tough war on drugs
1242867 1246121 when he and city police<br />launched a major sting operation,
1246204 1250166 resulting in the arrest of notorious<br />mafia crime figure Salvatore maroni
1250250 1254421 with what, to this day, remains<br />the biggest drug bust in gcpd history.
1254504 1255922 I assume you heard about this.
1256172 1257652 [Newscaster 2 continues indistinctly]
1257799 1259119 - Yeah.<br />- [Video fast-fonivarding]
1266057 1267392 Oh, I see.
1268226 1270186 [Gordon on video]<br />All this blood is from his head?
1270687 1271896 Dear god.
1280655 1282699 [Lead detective] There's a cipher too.
1290707 1293001 [Gordon]<br />Any of this mean anything to you?
1293835 1295420 [Camera shutter clicking]
1296171 1297964 The killer left this for the Batman?
1299382 1301050 [Gordon]<br />I asked him to come, Pete.
1301134 1302135 Apparently.
1302427 1304304 You're becoming quite a celebrity.
1306347 1307682 Why is he writing to you?
1307765 1309243 [Pete]<br />It's Mitchell, for Christ sakes!
1309267 1310310 I don't know yet.
1310393 1311936 [Pete] I got the press downstairs.
1313813 1315231 Have a shower.
1316691 1318371 Our accounting friends<br />at Wayne enterprises
1318443 1319360 are coming for breakfast.
1319444 1321446 Here? Why?
1321529 1322673 Because I couldn't get you to go there.
1322697 1323817 I haven't got time for this.
1323865 1325533 It's getting serious, Bruce.
1325617 1328703 If this continues, it won't be long<br />before you've nothing left.
1328786 1330371 I don't care about that.
1331289 1332165 Any of that.
1332248 1333888 You don't care about<br />your family's legacy?
1336127 1339255 What I'm doing is my family's legacy.
1339339 1341508 If I can't change things here,
1342050 1343968 if I can't have an effect,
1345053 1346679 then I don't care what happens to me.
1346763 1347889 That's what I'm afraid of.
1347972 1349599 Alfred, stop.
1350975 1352435 You're not my father.
1355230 1356648 I'm well aware.
1359943 1362237 [Somber music playing]
1363488 1364822 [Machine whirs]
1390974 1393226 [Gordon on video]<br />We really gotta go, man.
1402151 1404153 [Soft classical music playing]
1418876 1420461 Some fresh berries there.
1427635 1428761 What are you doing?
1429137 1432807 Just reminiscing about<br />my days in the circus.
1433182 1437103 [Inhales sharply]<br />This is actually quite elusive.
1440106 1441774 Where'd you get those o's?
1441899 1443234 [Alfred smacks lips]
1443318 1446112 "He lies still" is only a partial key.
1446195 1448615 It only gives us h, e, I, I, s, and t.
1448698 1452744 So, I'm looking for any double symbols<br />to start, trying letters,
1452827 1454203 see where it leads.
1456122 1457123 That's interesting.
1458374 1459500 [Woman] Mr. Pennyworth?
1459876 1460877 Yes, dory?
1461210 1462670 The accountants are here.
1462754 1464589 See them in, please, dory.
1467508 1469719 [Bruce] What if it's not a partial key?
1469802 1471387 What do you mean?
1471471 1473306 What if this is the whole key?
1474223 1476768 Ignore the symbols<br />we don't have letters for.
1476851 1478954 Use only the letters from<br />"he lies still" and leave the rest...
1478978 1480146 Blank. Yeah, I understand.
1480229 1482357 But that would leave<br />most of the cipher unsolved.
1482440 1484275 I don't see how that's gonna...
1484859 1486653 [Suspenseful music playing]
1501626 1503294 [Gordon] Damn.
1503461 1505713 Yeah, he's got a car.
1506631 1509008 Guess it's good to be the mayor.
1509092 1510760 Where to even start?
1511344 1513680 You sure this isn't a leap?<br />"Drive" could mean anything.
1513763 1514883 [Batman] You don't trust me?
1515765 1517392 You mean like you trust me?
1517475 1520353 It's been two years now,<br />and I don't even know who you are, man.
1522355 1523481 [Batman] There.
1525983 1527527 [Suspenseful music continues]
1535410 1536786 [Air hissing]
1546587 1547880 What are we looking for?
1548506 1550049 A USB port.

1551509 1553010 [Whirring]
1558349 1559517 What?
1564897 1567150 "Thumb" drive.
1567942 1569569 Jesus.
1573197 1574699 It's encrypted.
1578119 1579412 Try this.
1586419 1588796 Oh, this guy's hilarious.
1593468 1595178 - [Key clacks]<br />- [Beep]
1597680 1600266 Oh, well, well, well.

1603102 1604270 Who is she?
1604353 1605938 Noidea.
1606856 1609692 But that's the penguin,<br />carmine Falcone's right hand.
1610026 1611826 - I know who he is.<br />- [Notification whooshing]
1611986 1612987 What was that?
1614739 1617575 Shit, shit! The drive.
1618326 1620661 It sent out the photos from my account.
1620745 1623289 Gotham post, gazette, go-1, all of them.
1623372 1625458 Jesus.
1625541 1627919 I'm gonna catch hell for this.<br />Pete's gonna bust a gasket.
1628002 1629462 "He lies still."
1629670 1630713 About her?
1631964 1633549 Maybe.
1633716 1635593 That's the iceberg lounge.
1635676 1639096 It's under the shoreline lofts<br />where Falcone was holed up.
1639180 1641307 Never get in there without a warrant.
1643643 1644727 Yeah.
1649315 1651234 [Train rumbles past]

1663079 1664497 I want to see the penguin.
1665206 1667458 I don't know<br />what you're talking about, pal.
1672839 1673840 What's the problem?
1673923 1675341 Says he wants to see the penguin.
1675424 1677593 Penguin? There's no penguin here.
1677677 1679303 That's what I tried to tell him.
1679387 1681681 Get out of here, freak. You hear me?
1681764 1683724 Or that little suit's<br />gonna get all full of blood.

1780655 1781906 [Batman] Who is she?
1782365 1784075 [Muffled club music playing]
1784951 1786869 I really don't know, chief.
1787578 1789789 I might have been coming out<br />at the same time,
1789872 1791248 but I wasn't rolling with them.
1791999 1793668 [Footsteps approaching]
1804679 1805680 It's okay, baby.
1806222 1810017 Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.<br />Come on.

1849015 1850808 - Whose murder?<br />- The mayor's.
1851308 1852685 Is that the mayor?
1852768 1854562 Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.
1855771 1857064 Don't make me hurt you.
1857148 1861318 You better watch it.<br />You know my reputation?

1866115 1867616 Look_.
1868868 1871662 I'm just the proprietor, okay?
1872496 1876792 I mean, what people do here<br />ain't got nothing to do with me.
1885134 1886719 Tell you one thing.
1888888 1892475 Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.
1892975 1895478 Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?<br />Maybe she knows.
1898731 1900566 What? Too soon?
1907615 1909283 [Soft suspenseful music plays]
1910409 1912787 You let me know<br />if there's anything else I can do.

1956497 1959792 Okay. No. No, stay there.<br />Wait for me, okay?
1959875 1961585 Wait for me, I'm on my way home.
1961669 1962670 [Woman on phone crying]
1962753 1966382 Listen, baby, we're gonna get<br />the hell out of here, okay? I promise.

2261552 2264012 I didn't kill anybody.<br />I'm here for my friend.
2264096 2265532 She's trying to<br />get the hell out of here,
2265556 2267307 and this son of a bitch<br />stole her passport.
2267391 2268767 What does she know?
2268851 2271037 Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked<br />she won't even tell me.
2271061 2272646 She did seem upset.
2274440 2275941 Back at your place.
2277985 2279486 Let's go talk to her.
2285075 2287077 [Engines roaring]

2323780 2325258 [Newscaster]<br />More breaking news this hour
2325282 2330662 as the city is rocked by a second<br />high-profile murder in as many nights.
2330746 2333099 And this time, the killer has<br />come fon/vard to claim credit online...
2333123 2335959 Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?<br />She's just a kid.
2336793 2337793 [Sighs]
2337836 2339588 Shit, they took my phone.
2339671 2341107 [Newscaster 2] His victim, longtime head<br />of the Gotham city pd,
2341131 2342549 commissioner Pete savage,
2342633 2344760 was found dead earlier tonight
2344843 2348055 inside the police athletic league<br />facilities in the tricorner area.
2348138 2351475 The killer posted the following message<br />on social media,
2351558 2354436 and we have to warn you,<br />the video is very disturbing.
2358023 2359316 [Deep and heavy breathing on TV]
2359525 2362236 [Distorted male voice]<br />Hello, people of Gotham.
2362319 2364279 This is the riddler speaking.
2365781 2367407 On Halloween night,
2367491 2372287 I killed your mayor because he was not<br />who he pretended to be.
2372371 2374414 But I am not done.
2376083 2377501 [Muffled whimpering on TV]
2377584 2379753 Here is another...
2380504 2382089 [Whimpering]
2382548 2383882 [Rattling]
2384258 2387052 Who will soon be losing face.
2387135 2388303 [Pete whimpers]
2388387 2392599 I will kill again, and again, and again,
2392683 2394518 until our day of judgment
2394601 2399606 when the truth about our city<br />[Raises voice] will finally...
2400399 2402401 [In normal tone] Be unmasked.
2403986 2405737 Goodbye!
2406321 2408031 [Pete panting and whimpering]
2409992 2411678 [Newscaster] Commissioner savage<br />served a distinguished
2411702 2413829 30-year career on the gcpd...
2413912 2416123 Holy shit, I seen that guy too.
2417499 2418500 At the club.
2420168 2421587 The iceberg lounge?
2422337 2423797 44 below.
2425716 2426717 What is that?
2429970 2431513 The club within the club.
2432598 2434516 [Scoffs] The real club.
2436810 2438562 It's a mob hangout.
2439021 2440439 Is that where you work?
2440564 2441732 [Cat meows]
2442357 2443357 Senna?
2449072 2450949 No, I just work the bar upstairs.
2454411 2455954 But I see 'em come in.
2456038 2457247 Who?
2457831 2460250 A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,<br />I can tell you that.
2461835 2464504 Your basic upstanding citizen types.
2466757 2468300 You're gonna help me on this.
2468925 2470427 For your friend.
2472095 2473722 [Cat meowing]
2481021 2482356 You got a lot of cats.
2483857 2485776 I have a thing about strays.
2486318 2488195 [Gentle music playing]
2489905 2491239 You're not safe here.
2492366 2493533 I can take care of myself.
2493617 2496411 [Newscaster] Two public figures now dead<br />in just the last two nights,
2496495 2498038 and only days before the election.
2498121 2501375 Police and city officials<br />are left searching for a killer
2501458 2504294 and hoping to find him<br />before he kills again.
2522312 2525482 He waited for him at the gym.
2526608 2528652 Pete always liked to work out<br />late at night,
2528735 2530862 when no one else was around.
2531988 2533407 There's a needle Mark on his neck.
2533490 2535450 Injected him with arsenic.
2537452 2538787 Rat poison.
2539579 2541164 Yeah.
2541331 2543792 That seems to be his theme here.
2544334 2545711 Look at this thing.
2545794 2547295 [Eerie music playing]
2553844 2555595 It's a maze.
2555762 2556888 [Flashlight clicks]
2558181 2561476 What kind of demented son of a bitch<br />does this to a person?
2564229 2565313 [Batman] More symbols.
2567816 2569401 It's another cipher.
2569484 2572237 He blasted these out<br />after his message went viral.
2572904 2575490 Bastard murders you and your reputation.
2575574 2578702 That guy pushes drops. On the east end.
2580287 2581621 I don't get it.
2581705 2584082 Why would Pete get involved<br />in something like this?
2585000 2587002 Looks like he got greedy.
2587085 2588128 You kidding me?
2588211 2590922 After everything we did<br />to take down the maronis?
2591006 2594259 We busted their entire operation,<br />then he caves to some lowlife dealer?
2594342 2596553 Maybe he's not who you thought.
2598096 2600140 You make it sound like he had it coming.
2602392 2603852 He was a cop.
2605187 2606480 Crossed a line.
2625957 2627083 [Flashlight clicks oft]
2629336 2630837 [Eerie music continues]
2637719 2639387 "I'm mad about you.
2639471 2643141 Want to know my name?<br />Just look inside and see."
2650273 2653360 "Follow the maze until you find the rat.
2653527 2657113 Bring him into the light,<br />and you'll find where I'm at."
2657197 2658907 The hell is that?
2659658 2662828 "Bring him into the light"?<br />"Find the rat"?
2663954 2665455 I don't know.
2666331 2667499 [Martinez] Lieutenant.
2667582 2669000 They're coming back.
2669084 2670484 [Gordon] We got to get out of here.
2671086 2672462 [Eerie music continues]
2674422 2675632 Come on.
2680720 2681763 [Selina] Ow!
2683223 2684558 I don't know about these things.
2684641 2688103 I need to see in there,<br />this hunting ground.
2692107 2694693 Hey, why am I starting to feel<br />like a fish on a hook?
2696570 2698029 I'm just looking for Annika.
2702325 2703952 Boy, you're a real sweetheart.
2705078 2707706 You really don't care what happens to me<br />in there tonight, do you?
2708456 2710166 [Gentle music playing]
2717257 2718466 Look at me.
2728101 2730270 Looks good. Here.

2776399 2777400 Yeah.
2786076 2787077 Hey, where you goin'?
2787702 2788828 Hospitality.
2789579 2792415 [Batman] That's one of the guys<br />I got into it with the other night.
2794209 2795710 Looks like I broke his nose.
2795919 2797462 [Door slides open]
2800548 2801716 [Computer trilling]
2802384 2804469 "Kenzie, William."
2804552 2806012 He's an off-duty cop.
2807889 2809867 Are you sure no one can see<br />these things in my eyes?
2809891 2811935 Don't worry. I'm watching you.
2812936 2813937 [Sighs]
2815355 2818149 - [Techno music playing]<br />- [Indistinct chatter]
2825615 2826895 [Computer trilling rhythmically]
2828493 2831621 Don't look away.<br />I need time to make ids.
2831705 2832831 Great.
2840088 2842441 These guys have a little problem<br />with eye contact, don't they?
2842465 2844050 Feels good, doesn't it?
2844134 2846344 [Man] Yeah, baby. Feels real good.
2852392 2854019 [Selina] Jesus, I hate dropheads.
2854102 2855145 [Batman] Really?
2855228 2856247 'Cause when I first saw you,
2856271 2857540 it looked like you were<br />dealing for penguin.
2857564 2859816 You don't know<br />what you're talking about. Can we not...
2860442 2862193 Can we not do this right now?
2864112 2865655 Wait. Who was that?
2865739 2866906 Oh, I saw him.
2866990 2868074 [Batman] Look back.
2868158 2870011 If I look back, it's gonna be<br />a whole can of worms.
2870035 2871369 I need to see his face.
2873038 2874497 [Sighs] Jesus.
2882505 2883673 That's the da.
2883757 2884799 Gil Colson.
2884883 2886551 And he's coming over. You happy?
2886634 2887844 [Batman] Talk to him.
2890972 2892057 Hey. How you doing?
2893308 2894308 I'm Gil.
2895351 2896978 Hey, aren't you the da?
2897062 2898062 Yeah.
2898229 2900398 Wow. [Chuckles] I've seen you on TV.
2900482 2901858 Is that right?
2902275 2904486 I haven't seen you around here before.
2905487 2907530 It's a hell of a time<br />to be the new girl,
2907614 2910158 'cause people are all a little on edge.
2910241 2911801 [Selina] Oh, honey, I live on the edge.
2911826 2913095 - [Gil] Is that right?<br />- [Selina chuckles]
2913119 2914329 [Gil chuckles] I like that.
2914704 2915747 Do you want to come over?
2915830 2916956 Sure.
2919959 2921294 - [Gil] This is Travis.<br />- Hey.
2921377 2922937 [Gil] You wanna take a seat over there?
2923088 2924964 - Richie, Glen.<br />- [Richie] Hey.
2926424 2927926 That's half the da's office.
2928009 2929249 [Gil] You know Carla here, huh?
2930303 2932406 That's cheri. Don't mind her,<br />she's just taking a break.
2932430 2934307 Drowning our sorrows.
2934641 2935934 You want a drop?
2936017 2938061 [Selina] Uh, no, I'm good.<br />But you enjoy.
2938353 2939771 [Music continues on speakers]
2940021 2941689 Hope you don't mind.
2941773 2944133 I got a lot on my shoulders<br />with that psycho running around.
2944275 2945275 He's wasted.
2945318 2946361 No shit.
2948029 2949149 [Chuckles] I like this girl.
2949489 2951074 Oh, hey, I like you too!
2954619 2957956 I mean, this riddler, he's going after<br />the most powerful people in the city.
2958039 2959124 He knows so much.
2959207 2960559 [Travis] He doesn't know shit, man.
2960583 2962895 [Gil] What are you talking about?<br />Yeah, he does! What about that rat...
2962919 2963837 [Richie] Hey, hey, Gil, come on.
2963920 2965898 - Think maybe you had a little too much.<br />- Hey. The rat.
2965922 2967882 - [Richie] Slow down.<br />- Ask him about the rat.
2969884 2971719 [Selina] Hey, what's this about a rat?
2975014 2976599 [Inhales deeply]
2982063 2983273 I mean...
2984107 2987694 There was a rat. We had an informant.
2988278 2990697 We had big-time information<br />on Salvatore maroni.
2990780 2992550 That's how we got him out of<br />the drops business.
2992574 2994159 He's talking about the maroni case.
2994242 2997537 But if this guy knows,<br />it's gonna come out.
2998121 3000415 And when it does,<br />this whole city's gonna come apart.
3000498 3002417 Okay, I don't wanna hear this.
3002500 3005187 This is the kind of pillow talk<br />that got that Russian girl disappeared.
3005211 3006462 What do you know about that?
3008089 3009257 Does anybody want a drink?
3009340 3010340 [Gil] I want a drink.
3010466 3011718 Keep him talking.
3014804 3015889 Wait, where are you going?
3015972 3017015 She knows Annika.
3017098 3018516 No, stay on the da.
3018600 3020518 I told you I'm looking for my friend.
3022645 3024772 - Where's Annika?<br />- Out of my face. I don't know you.
3024856 3025958 Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?
3025982 3028586 - What have you heard? Is she okay?<br />- Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.
3028610 3029861 What, you got a death wish?
3029944 3032405 [Man] Hey, what's the problem, ladies?
3032488 3035408 [Carla]<br />There's no problem. It's just girl talk.
3035491 3037052 Let's keep it festive down here,<br />all right?
3037076 3038161 [Carla] Sure thing, oz.
3042916 3043958 Hey.
3044542 3045627 Hey.
3046794 3049964 Been a long time<br />since I seen you down here.
3051257 3052467 How you been?
3054802 3056512 Yeah, I've been okay.
3057847 3059224 I was just...
3061267 3063102 I was just headed back upstairs.
3063853 3064854 Well...
3065939 3067607 Don't be a stranger.
3081704 3084082 - You know carmine Falcone.<br />- I told you it's a mob spot.
3084165 3085809 You didn't tell me<br />you had a relationship with him.
3085833 3087627 I don't have<br />a relationship with him, okay?
3087710 3089605 - Well, that's not what it looked like.<br />- Forget it.
3089629 3090713 Wait, what are you doing?
3090797 3093216 - Listen, I can't do this anymore.<br />- No! No!
3093341 3094884 [Line breaking up]
3095301 3096469 [Static buzzes, stream stops]
3097804 3098805 [Selina] Taxi!
3099055 3100556 [Heavy breathing]
3102767 3103768 [Gil] Hey!
3105478 3106562 I lost you in there.
3106646 3107730 Yeah, I gotta go.
3108606 3110024 Oh, you need a ride?
3110733 3112026 That's me right there.
3112318 3114279 [Eerie music playing]
3118116 3119200 Taxi!
3119284 3120410 I'm good.
3122120 3123538 I hope, uh_.
3128126 3129544 I'll see you around.
3129627 3130753 [Car door closes]
3133506 3135383 [Eerie music continues]
3144434 3146102 [Car alarm chirps]
3163953 3165997 [Glass squeaking]
3168082 3170251 [Eerie music continues]
3179802 3181262 [Breathes deeply]
3181596 3183056 [Gil grunts]
3183139 3184891 [Train rumbles past]
3187685 3189771 [Car horn blaring continuously]
3196027 3197070 [Car horn stops]
3200490 3202325 [Gil grunting weakly]
3213586 3215671 - [Gil grunts]<br />- [Riddler shushes]
3216214 3220009 Just hold still.
3220843 3222678 - [Beeping]<br />- [Gil whimpers]
3225098 3227350 [Riddler breathing heavily and raspily]
3228184 3230436 [Eerie music continues]
3239070 3240405 [Wistful music playing]
3275356 3276482 [Switch clicks]
3278359 3279277 [Batman] What do you know about
3279360 3281654 a confidential informant<br />in the maroni case?
3284740 3286451 Yeah, sure, there was.
3287160 3288995 That's the rat we're looking for.
3289912 3291789 Somehow riddler knows who he is.
3292373 3295376 If we find the rat,<br />maybe it'll lead us to him.
3295460 3296919 Where are you getting this?
3297003 3299881 I have a source<br />who spoke to the da tonight.
3300673 3302133 Gil's very nervous.
3303092 3305636 I think the killer's targeting<br />people close to that case.
3305720 3307597 I worked that case.
3307680 3309640 Riddler's not after you.
3309724 3310724 How do you know?
3311017 3312435 You're not corrupt.
3313478 3315021 Colson's dirty?
3320902 3322403 Maybe I, uh...
3323070 3326407 I go after him.<br />Lean on him to give up the rat.
3326491 3329785 It's too dangerous.<br />They made a secret deal with this guy.
3330536 3332330 Who knows how many people it touches.
3332413 3335625 Politicians. Police. The courts.
3336918 3338628 It could tear the whole city apart.
3339045 3341088 [Gordon] Jesus, this is a powder keg.
3342715 3344467 [Batman] And riddler's the match.
3345343 3346570 [Batman on video]<br />You know carmine Falcone.
3346594 3347946 [Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.
3347970 3349448 [Batman] You didn't tell me you had<br />a relationship with him.
3349472 3351032 [Selina] I don't have a relationship...
3351057 3351933 [Video rewinds]
3352016 3353660 [Batman] You didn't tell me you had<br />a relationship with him.
3353684 3355454 [Selina] I don't have<br />a relationship with him. Okay?
3355478 3356395 [Video rewinds]
3356479 3357939 [Batman] You know carmine Falcone.
3358022 3359124 [Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.
3359148 3360834 [Batman] You didn't tell me<br />you had a relationship with him.
3360858 3362753 [Selina] I don't have<br />a relationship with him. Okay?
3362777 3364257 - [Alfred] Pretty.<br />- [Tape clicks oft]
3366030 3367406 She a new friend of yours?
3371994 3373204 I'm not so sure.
3374038 3375540 Looks like you upset her.
3376707 3378834 Shall I take this as a good sign?
3378918 3379919 What?
3380002 3380920 Your attire.
3381003 3383130 Is Bruce Wayne making<br />an actual appearance?
3383214 3385216 There's a public memorial<br />for mayor Mitchell.
3385299 3387969 Serial killers like to<br />follow reactions to their crimes.
3389011 3390596 Riddler might not be able to resist.
3390680 3392139 Oh, that reminds me.
3393307 3397270 I've taken the Liberty of doing<br />a little work on this latest cipher.
3397812 3399313 The one from the rat maze.
3399730 3402817 I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,
3403150 3405027 but I'm fairly certain<br />this translates to,
3405111 3408364 "you are El rata alada."
3408990 3410408 [Bruce] Rata alada?
3410491 3411701 "Rat with wings"?
3411784 3414287 It's slang for "pigeon."<br />Does that mean anything to you?
3414370 3415621 Yeah.
3417081 3418207 A stool pigeon.
3418457 3420084 Where are your cufflinks?
3420167 3421167 I couldn't find them.
3422587 3424547 Well, you can't go out like that.
3424630 3426424 Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.
3430595 3433389 You have to keep up appearances.<br />You're still a Wayne.
3433472 3434473 [Scoffs]
3435099 3437310 And what about you? Are you a Wayne?
3438311 3440104 Your father gave them to me.
3442940 3444609 [Gentle music playing]
3445860 3448988 [Protesters chanting]<br />No more lies! No more lies!
3467173 3470134 Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,<br />you're going straight down there.
3474138 3475431 [Melancholy music playing]
3476432 3478559 [Protesters continue chanting]
3482688 3484440 [Reporter] Is that Bruce Wayne?
3484523 3487151 [Reporters] Mr. Wayne!<br />Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!
3487443 3490905 - [Reporters clamoring]<br />- [Camera shutters clicking]
3496243 3497244 [Man] Hold it.
3498579 3499830 You good, fellas?
3500414 3501415 Good.
3503542 3504627 We're good, Mr. Falcone.
3505169 3507213 [Melancholy music continues]
3522436 3523437 Sir?
3523771 3525314 [Reporters continue clamoring]
3543124 3544124 [Bodyguard] Hey!
3544166 3546168 Give us a wide berth here,<br />would you, slick?
3547128 3548963 Hey, watch it, fellas.
3549422 3551716 You got the prince of the city there.
3554552 3556387 Some event, huh?
3556470 3559432 Brought out the one guy in the city<br />more reclusive than me.
3559515 3561976 Thought you'd never leave the shoreline.
3562059 3563745 Aren't you afraid<br />someone'll take a shot at you?
3563769 3565771 Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?
3566647 3568065 Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?
3568691 3570151 Wow. Is that right?
3570234 3572278 His father saved my life.
3573237 3576449 I got shot in the chest. Right here.
3577658 3581162 I couldn't go to no hospital,<br />so we showed up on his doorstep.
3581454 3584665 Operated right on the dining room table.
3584749 3590004 Kid here, he saw the whole thing,<br />up on the stairs looking down.
3591422 3593424 I remember your face.
3595426 3597386 You don't think that meant something,<br />he did that?
3597762 3599889 It meant he took the hippocratic oath.
3601223 3602808 "Hippocratic oath."
3605352 3606562 That's good.
3607104 3608272 Excuse me.
3609315 3610816 [Laughs]
3611859 3612859 Yes.
3613235 3615571 ["Ave Maria" playing]
3617448 3619283 [Indistinct radio chatter]
3621327 3623996 - [Heavy breathing]<br />- [Man coughing]
3626874 3628018 [Announcer on mic] Ladies and gentlemen,
3628042 3629686 thank you all for<br />coming to today's memorial
3629710 3632087 for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.
3632171 3633964 Our program will begin shortly.
3634048 3635488 As a reminder, the family asked that
3635549 3637027 those wishing to honor<br />the mayor's memory
3637051 3638469 consider a donation to
3638552 3640596 - the cause most dear to his heart...<br />- [Scuffling]
3640679 3642932 The Gotham renewal fund,
3643015 3644225 our city's safety net.
3644600 3647144 What good's a safety net<br />doesn't catch anybody?
3648229 3651982 Didn't help my daughter<br />when she needed it, I can tell you that.
3652066 3655277 The guy was just another<br />rich scum-sucker.
3656278 3658155 He got what he deserved.
3660074 3661075 Know what I mean?
3662368 3664495 Hey, don't I know you?
3664578 3665663 [Woman] Bruce Wayne.
3666580 3668541 Why haven't you called me back?
3668624 3669625 I'm sorry?
3669917 3672253 I'm Bella real. I'm running for mayor.
3672336 3673605 I wouldn't be bothering you here,
3673629 3676298 but your people keep telling me<br />you're unavailable.
3676382 3677716 Will you walk with me?
3679802 3681512 ["Ave Maria" continues playing]
3682888 3684223 Mr. Wayne.
3684306 3685516 Mr. Wayne.
3686225 3689311 You know, you really could be<br />doing more for this city.
3689895 3691730 Your family has<br />a history of philanthropy,
3691814 3694233 but as far as I can tell,<br />you're not doing anything.
3694316 3696777 If I'm elected, I want to change that.
3697361 3698654 Thank you.
3699530 3700531 [Bella] My god.
3702366 3704869 I'm gonna go pay my respects.<br />Will you wait for me?
3704952 3706579 I want to continue this.
3710791 3711791 Excuse me.
3713711 3715588 I'm so sorry for your loss.
3717798 3718716 Thank you.
3718799 3720559 [Gordon] Excuse me, chief.<br />Can I talk to you?
3721886 3723762 Gil Colson is missing.
3723846 3725139 [MacKenzie] What?
3725222 3727516 He hasn't been heard from<br />since last night.
3727600 3728642 Christ, not again.
3728726 3730811 Hey. Mr. Wayne.
3733105 3735149 You got people looking for him, Jim?
3735816 3738110 [Gordon] Sent a couple guys<br />to his house. Nothing.
3738193 3739111 [MacKenzie] What'd his wife say?
3739194 3740594 [Gordon] She hadn't heard from him.
3742364 3743782 [People outside screaming]
3744533 3745743 [Indistinct shouting]
3747953 3749622 [Tires squeal]
3750539 3751540 [Loud bang]
3757630 3758923 [Tires screeching]
3760257 3762092 - [Engine revving]<br />- [People shrieking]
3765596 3767139 [Suspenseful music builds up]
3774772 3776565 [Tires screeching]
3777650 3779026 [People clamoring]
3780235 3781987 [Menacing music playing]
3795167 3796287 [Gordon] Get out of the car!
3796835 3799046 Get out of the car and show your hands!
3800464 3801674 Get out!
3810808 3812101 [Man in car grunting]
3812184 3813477 Get 'em up!
3813560 3815312 Get out! Show 'em!
3816897 3818023 [Panting]
3819775 3821360 Christ, it's Colson.
3821443 3823153 [Officer]<br />There's a bomb around his neck!
3826281 3828325 - [Cell phone ringing]<br />- [People gasp]
3828909 3830327 [Whimpering]
3831120 3832413 [Cell phone continues ringing]
3838210 3839753 Let's clear this place out now!
3839837 3841877 [Officer 2]<br />We've got to get this place cleared out!
3841922 3843382 [People clamoring]
3843799 3845300 [Cell phone continues ringing]
3855185 3856395 [Cell phone ringing]
3856478 3857896 [Whirring]
3871910 3873829 - [Ringing continues]<br />- [Camera shutter clicks]
3875706 3878459 [Man] Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.
3878751 3880753 [Sirens wailing]
3881462 3883062 [Officer]<br />We don't know if he's in on it.
3886008 3887342 What's he looking at?
3887718 3889553 [Cell phone ringing]
3891013 3892890 [Distant footsteps]
3896143 3898562 [Footsteps coming closer]
3898896 3901106 [Ominous music playing]
3906111 3907446 Holy shit.
3908489 3910157 [MacKenzie] Are you kidding me?
3910240 3912993 What the hell is he doing? Gordon!
3913827 3916288 Your guy's gonna<br />get himself killed in there.
3917247 3919208 [Cell phone continues ringing]
3932054 3933263 Please.
3933430 3936183 He made me do it.<br />[Tearfully] I'm so sorry.
3936600 3938870 He told me if I didn't do exactly<br />what he said, he'd kill me.
3938894 3939895 I'm so sorry.
3940395 3942064 Looks like a combination lock.
3942147 3943607 Can't we just cut it off?
3944358 3946026 Not if you want to keep your head.
3949822 3951240 [Cell phone continues ringing]
3976473 3978350 [Riddler breathing heavily]
3982729 3983981 [Riddler] You came.
3985816 3986900 Who are you?
3990863 3992447 I'm nobody.
3993907 3996326 I'm just an instrument,
3996410 4000706 here to unmask the truth<br />about this cesspool we call a city.
4001248 4002332 "Unmask"?
4002416 4003584 Yes.
4004418 4007254 Let's do it together, okay?
4007337 4009756 I've been trying to reach you.
4010424 4012759 You're part of this too.
4012843 4014636 How am I a part of this?
4014720 4016638 You'll see.
4016722 4018533 [Officer] Hey, chief.<br />You better take a look at this.
4018557 4020642 [Riddler on stream]<br />Say hello to my followers.
4020726 4021977 We 're live.
4022060 4025063 They're here to watch our little trial.
4026273 4027441 At the moment,
4027524 4030903 the man across from you, Mr. Colson,
4030986 4032029 is dead.
4032112 4034174 Jesus, can we get somebody out here?<br />This psycho's gonna kill me!
4034198 4035198 But wait a minute...
4035240 4038368 [Shouting] Shut up! You deserve<br />to be dead after what you did!
4038452 4041455 You hear me?
4041538 4042539 [Softly] Okay.
4043081 4044708 [Riddler groaning comically]
4047169 4048754 [Riddler laughing]
4051298 4053383 [Riddler] I'm giving you a chance.
4055135 4057304 No one ever gave me a chance.
4059348 4060390 Now,
4061391 4064186 ever since I was a child,
4064269 4067856 I've always loved little puzzles.
4068440 4070859 For me, they are a retreat
4070943 4074279 from the horrors of our world.
4074363 4079576 Maybe they can bring<br />some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.
4079660 4081912 - You want me to do puzzles?<br />- [Chuckles excitedly]
4081995 4084748 Three riddles in two minutes.
4084831 4088919 You give me the answers,<br />and I'll give you the code for the lock.
4089002 4091338 - Do you understand?<br />- Yeah.
4091421 4093590 Okay, okay. So I just...
4093674 4094859 - You want me to...<br />- [Device beeps]
4094883 4097219 - [Whimpers]<br />- Riddle number one...
4097302 4100931 - [Timer beeping]<br />- ."It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,
4101014 4105686 but when it's denied,<br />it's violence you may find."
4105769 4108188 Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?
4108272 4109356 "Cruel"? "Poetic"?
4109439 4110857 - "Justice."<br />- huh?
4110941 4111984 The answer's "justice."
4112067 4113277 - Justice?<br />- Yes!
4113360 4114945 - Oh, god.<br />- Justice!
4115028 4119366 [Dramatically] And you were supposed<br />to be an arm of justice in this city,
4119449 4121827 along with the late mayor<br />and police commissioner,
4121910 4124288 were you not, Mr. Colson?
4124371 4125640 Of course, of course. Of course.
4125664 4128041 Riddle number two.
4128125 4132254 "If you are justice, please do not lie.
4132337 4136508 What is the price for your blind eye?”
4136591 4138385 - "The price"?<br />- [Batman] "Bribes."
4138468 4139720 Oh, god. "Bribes"?
4139803 4142031 He's asking you how much it cost<br />for you to turn your back.
4142055 4143307 [Hesitating]
4143390 4144575 [Shouting] Fifty-eight seconds!
4144599 4145851 - How much?<br />- Nothing!
4145934 4148145 - [Raises voice] How much?<br />- Ten grand. Ten gs a month.
4148228 4150581 I get a monthly payment<br />just not to prosecute certain cases.
4150605 4151440 What cases?
4151523 4152649 He didn't ask me that!
4152733 4154168 - Come on! Ten grand.<br />- [Riddler laughing]
4154192 4157154 - That's my answer. It's ten grand!<br />- Okay. Okay. Okay.
4157237 4159865 Don'tlose your head, Mr. Colson.
4159948 4163785 Just one more to go<br />before your time runs out.
4163869 4166288 [Singsongy] Last riddle.
4166371 4170709 [Dramatically]<br />"Since your justice is so select,
4170792 4175088 please tell us which vermin<br />you're paid to protect."
4175172 4177257 - "Which vermin"?<br />- [Batman] The rat.
4177341 4179885 The informant you all protect<br />from the Salvatore maroni case.
4179968 4181821 - How do you know about that?<br />- What's his name?
4181845 4183055 Twenty seconds.
4183138 4184806 - No.<br />- He's gonna kill you.
4184890 4186909 I'm a dead man either way.<br />You're talking to a dead man, okay?
4186933 4188477 If I go out this way, it's just me.
4188560 4191688 But if I give over that name,<br />I have family, people I love.
4191772 4193231 - He'll kill them too.<br />- Who will?
4193315 4194709 - People are watching.<br />- What people?
4194733 4196860 It's so much bigger<br />than you could ever imagine.
4196943 4199112 - It's the whole system!<br />- Five!
4199196 4200072 - Four!<br />- [Beeping rapidly]
4200155 4201591 - Oh, god, have mercy on me...<br />- Three!
4201615 4203492 - Goodbye!<br />- [Device trills]
4203700 4204700 [Batman grunts]
4206870 4208830 [People gasp]
4210248 4212000 [Ears ringing]
4213627 4215212 [Muffled, indistinct shouting]
4226681 4228558 [Ringing intensifies]
4230769 4231770 [Ringing stops]
4233688 4235124 [Martinez]<br />Who do you think he is under there?
4235148 4235982 [Gordon] Take it easy.
4236066 4237067 [Martinez] I want to see.
4238402 4239842 [Medic] What is that thing? Leather?
4243365 4244825 [Medic 2] What's he got on his eyes?
4244908 4246427 [Martinez] Who cares?<br />I want to see his face.
4246451 4247720 What are we doing here?<br />Let's just take it off...
4247744 4249224 - [Gordon] Hey!<br />- [Officers clamoring]
4249496 4252624 Hey! Hey! Hey!
4252707 4254376 Relax, god damn it!
4254459 4255961 You're protecting this guy, Jim?
4257379 4259923 He interfered in<br />an active hostage situation.
4260006 4262426 Colson's blood is on his hands.
4262509 4263927 Maybe it's on yours.
4265387 4266430 What'd you say?
4266513 4268098 He would rather die than talk.
4268682 4270183 What was he afraid of?
4270934 4272018 You?
4272310 4273520 [Menacing music playing]
4279151 4280569 You son of a bitch.
4281153 4284156 You have any idea<br />what kind of trouble you're in?
4284239 4285949 You could be an accessory to murder.
4286032 4287135 [Officer] Why are we playing games...
4287159 4288827 [Officers clamoring]
4289161 4290036 [Officer 2] Get him! Come on!
4290120 4292122 Back off! Back off!
4292205 4294499 Great, now I got you<br />on assaulting an officer!
4294583 4296668 - You got me on assaulting three.<br />- Hey!
4296751 4299546 What's the matter with you?<br />This isn't the way to do this!
4299921 4301673 [Breathing heavily]
4302215 4303758 You too now?
4303842 4306386 Let me handle this, chief.<br />Just give me a minute.
4306470 4309055 You're gonna put yourself on the line<br />for this scumbag, Jim?
4309139 4311391 Just give me a minute.<br />I'll get him to cooperate.
4314186 4315687 Okay, give him the room.
4331328 4332621 Two minutes.
4344382 4345967 You listen to me.
4347552 4349554 [Softly] We gotta get you out of here.
4351223 4353183 That would put a lot of heat on you.
4353266 4354935 Well, you punched me in the face.
4356019 4357103 [Batman scoffs]
4357187 4358480 Take this key.
4359773 4363151 Through that door. Hallway to the stairs<br />that go to the roof.
4364194 4365954 [Kenzie] Hey, what the hell<br />is going on here?
4366905 4369199 Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?
4369616 4371868 [Suspenseful music playing]
4372577 4374955 Who's the mustache with the broken nose?
4378375 4381086 That's Kenzie. Narcotics.
4381169 4384089 He's one of the guys I got into it with<br />at the iceberg lounge.
4385006 4387634 What are you saying?<br />Kenzie moonlights for the penguin?
4390345 4392305 Or he moonlights as a cop.
4396893 4398453 - [Officer] Jesus Christ!<br />- [Kenzie] Go!
4398478 4399980 [Officer 2] Somebody stop him!
4400564 4402440 [Officers clamoring]
4404067 4405402 [Tense music playing]
4427173 4428550 [Gasping]
4430427 4431803 [Grunts]
4438184 4440064 - [Officer 1] There he is!<br />- [Officer 2] Freeze!
4442397 4444316 [Heroic music playing]
4459039 4460081 [Grunting]
4464711 4466212 [Groaning]
4486107 4488147 [Gordon] Could have at least<br />pulled that punch, man.
4488568 4489778 I did.
4489861 4493239 Bock put out an apb on you.<br />You really think he's in on this?
4493323 4495367 I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?
4495450 4496576 I only trust you.
4496660 4498995 What's a narcotics cop doing<br />with Falcone's right-hand man?
4499079 4502457 Colson said, "cops protect the rat."<br />Maybe Kenzie's part of it.
4503208 4504334 You think penguin's the rat?
4504417 4507462 His club caters to the mob.<br />Maroni practically lived there.
4507545 4509506 Penguin would have been<br />privy to a lot of dirt.
4509589 4510924 Da was a regular too.
4511007 4514511 Maybe penguin got himself into a jam<br />and working a deal was his only way out.
4515595 4516805 The rata alada.
4516888 4517888 The what?
4517931 4519391 Riddler's latest.
4519474 4521184 The cipher in the maze.
4521267 4523770 It means "a rat with wings."<br />Like a stool pigeon.
4525355 4526981 A penguin's got wings too.
4528983 4530944 Time for me<br />to have another conversation with him.
4531027 4532755 What about the riddler?<br />He's gonna kill again.
4532779 4535990 It's all connected.<br />Like it or not, it's his game now.
4536074 4539244 You want to find riddler,<br />we gotta find that rat.
4539494 4540995 [Thunder rumbling]
4541871 4544071 [Gordon on radio]<br />Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.
4544874 4545959 [Batman] There's penguin.
4546042 4547919 [Gordon] I wonder what's in the bags.
4549546 4550797 You want to move in?
4552674 4554134 [Batman] Let's follow.
4554801 4557053 [Suspenseful music playing]
4562225 4563435 [Car horn honking]
4572652 4576197 They stopped at waterfront street.<br />The recycling plant.
4576322 4577574 [Batman] I'm here.
4578992 4580720 - [Penguin] How you doing?<br />- [Man] Yeah, good. How are you?
4580744 4583246 [Penguin] Good, good.<br />Let's get in out of this deluge.
4584706 4586750 [Conversation continues indistinctly]
4588585 4590336 [Suspenseful music continues]
4602474 4605018 It's a drug lab. Drops.
4605101 4606311 This is a buy.
4606394 4609564 Looks like they got maroni's operation<br />up and running again.
4609647 4610875 Or they never shut it down at all.
4610899 4611775 [Gordon] What are you saying?
4611858 4614986 The biggest drug bust in gcpd history<br />was a fraud?
4615278 4616946 [Motorcycle approaching]
4617697 4619699 [Suspenseful music continues]
4639344 4640762 This just got complicated.
4641513 4642680 What do you mean?
4646851 4648228 [Twin 1 grunts]
4648603 4650063 Hey! What happened?
4650146 4651481 You all right?
4653483 4654609 [Grunts]
4662200 4663993 Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.
4664118 4665745 [Sighs] Jesus.
4666496 4668331 Is this how you get your kicks, hon?
4668832 4670166 Sneaking up on girls in the dark?
4670250 4671960 Is that why you work in the club?
4672710 4673753 It was all just a score?
4673837 4677632 I would love to sit and go over<br />every gory detail with you, bat boy...
4679008 4680927 But, uh, those assholes are coming back.
4685932 4687308 - [Gunfire]<br />- [Gasps]

5106143 5108771 - Who's the riddler?<br />- Riddler? How should I know?
5108854 5110207 [Gordon] Let's make it easy for you, oz.
5110231 5111649 Cops caught you doing something.
5111732 5113418 They were gonna shut you down,<br />put you away.
5113442 5115319 So you gave up a bigger fish<br />to save your ass.
5115403 5117530 You ratted out Salvatore maroni.
5117613 5118823 His drops operation.
5118906 5121367 But the cops, the city officials,<br />the mayor, the da,
5121450 5125079 they got greedy, right?<br />Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.
5125162 5126974 They wanted to take over<br />the drops business too,
5126998 5129333 but they needed a minor league mope<br />like you to run it.
5129417 5132628 You don't just work for carmine Falcone.<br />You work for them too.
5132712 5133879 What are you, crazy?
5133963 5135107 [Gordon] That why you killed the girl?
5135131 5136131 I didn't kill no girl!
5136173 5137967 We know she worked for you<br />at the 44 below.
5138050 5139343 But she got too close, right?
5139427 5141697 Found out from Mitchell that you were<br />the rat, so you killed her.
5141721 5143681 But somehow riddler found out too.
5143764 5145683 He knows so much about you.
5145766 5147810 - You must know about him.<br />- Who is he?
5148394 5150604 Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.
5151022 5152302 Why don't you start harmonizing?
5152523 5155192 There's only one problem<br />with your little scenario, okay?
5155276 5156610 I ain't no rat!
5156694 5158588 You got any idea what carmine Falcone<br />would do to me
5158612 5159756 if he heard this kind of talk?
5159780 5161949 Oh, you don't wanna<br />talk about rats, huh?
5162033 5164577 Maybe we can talk about<br />what they did to my partner's face.
5164660 5166220 Holy god, what are you showing me here?
5166287 5167913 - This was around his head!<br />- Come on!
5167997 5169915 [Yells] Open your eyes!
5173836 5175421 Are you El rata alada?
5175504 5177006 El rata alada?
5177089 5178924 Yeah, a "rat with wings."<br />A stool pigeon.
5179008 5181344 That's not you?<br />The symbols in the maze, right here.
5181427 5184013 It says you are El rata alada.
5184096 5185473 "You are El rata"? It says that?
5185556 5186825 Why, you got something to tell us?
5186849 5187849 Yeah!
5188392 5189494 It's, like, the worst Spanish<br />I ever heard.
5189518 5190518 What?
5190770 5192104 It's "la."
5192188 5193481 "La" rata.
5193981 5195983 What, is this riddler stupid<br />or something?
5196067 5197943 Jesus! Look at you two.
5198361 5200613 World's greatest detectives!
5201030 5203383 Am I the only here knows the difference<br />between "El"and "la"?
5203407 5204492 Jesus!
5204575 5206077 No habla espafiol, fellas?
5206160 5208162 Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!
5209580 5210700 You think he made a mistake?
5210748 5211957 He doesn't make mistakes.
5212041 5213084 A rat with wings?
5213167 5214752 You know what that sounds like to me?
5214835 5218005 A friggin' bat! Huh?<br />You ever think of that?
5218089 5220091 "You are El rata."
5225721 5229600 "You are El."
5238275 5239777 Maybe it was a mistake.
5240194 5241028 Maybe he isn't as smart as...
5241112 5242112 - [Computer beeps]<br />- Wait.
5245366 5246700 Is that him?
5247576 5249412 - [Beeps]<br />- Holy shit.
5250413 5251413 [Typing]
5269306 5271186 What the hell does that mean?<br />Is he or isn't he?
5300296 5303924 "I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.
5304008 5306844 But in a mansion, in a slum,
5306927 5308846 I'll never know where I come from.
5309722 5311056 Do you know what I am?"
5311140 5312141 Any idea?
5312683 5313684 Yeah.
5315102 5316353 It's an orphan.
5325237 5326989 A mansion in a slum.
5328532 5331172 - He's talking about the old orphanage.<br />- The one that burned down?
5331202 5332912 It was part of the Wayne estate.
5333537 5335182 They donated it<br />after they built the tower.
5335206 5336206 Let's go.
5339293 5341754 You guys realize I'm still here, right?
5342796 5344173 You gonna untie me?
5344256 5346056 How the hell<br />am I supposed to get out of here?

5444023 5446066 Thank you all. Thank you, uh...
5446483 5448068 Thank you for coming today.
5449820 5451405 I believe in Gotham.
5452698 5454491 I believe in its promise.
5455701 5459163 But too many have been left behind<br />for too long,
5459705 5461498 and that's why I'm here today.
5461582 5464418 To announce,<br />not only my candidacy for mayor,
5464501 5467838 but also the creation<br />of the Gotham renewal fund.
5468380 5470257 Win or lose,
5470341 5473135 the Wayne foundation pledges<br />a $1 billion donation
5473594 5476430 to start a charitable endowment<br />for public works.
5477014 5481060 I want to bypass political gridlock,<br />and get money to people and projects
5481143 5483062 who need it now,
5483145 5484605 like these children behind me.
5484688 5486106 "Sins of the father."
5486190 5488651 Renewal is about growth.<br />It is about planting seeds...
5491111 5493197 And renewing Gotham's promise.
5493781 5495491 [Applause]
5497076 5499286 Shall be visited upon the son.
5501288 5504416 Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

5593756 5595424 I'm so sorry.
5596884 5598635 I've been trying to reach you.
5601388 5603148 [Detective]<br />The package was intended for you.
5603599 5607352 It was a 0-4 explosive sent in a mailer.<br />We found this too.
5621825 5624161 [EKG machine beeping]
5630083 5631710 We've sedated him.
5631794 5633420 We just have to hope he stabilizes.
5634296 5637007 You should go home, Mr. Wayne.<br />Get some sleep.
5637549 5639301 Is there anyone else to notify?

5794748 5797209 Yeah, well, things were getting<br />a little hot for me, so...
5797876 5799628 How could they do that to her?
5799711 5801672 That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.
5801755 5803674 Her body was in his car.
5803757 5806635 I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna<br />make him pay. You gonna help me?
5806718 5809721 - Help you?<br />- Yeah. I thought you were "vengeance."
5809805 5811407 Your friend got involved<br />with the wrong people.
5811431 5813058 She didn't know any better.
5813141 5814535 Maybe you should have<br />explained it to her.
5814559 5816119 What the hell is that supposed to mean?
5816186 5817747 It means your choices have consequences.
5817771 5820148 Jesus Christ. "Choices"?
5820232 5822943 You know, whoever the hell you are,<br />you obviously grew up rich.
5823026 5824861 - Was it worth it?<br />- What?
5825195 5827364 Compromising yourself for money?
5828740 5830993 What did you have to do<br />to set up that score?
5832619 5836289 How close did you have to get<br />to penguin? To Falcone?
5836373 5837767 You don't know<br />what the hell you're talking about.
5837791 5839126 Falcone owes me that money.
5839209 5840961 - He owes you?<br />- Yeah, and a lot more.
5841044 5841878 Oh, really? Why's that?
5841962 5842879 You know what? I can't even talk to you.
5842963 5844715 No! I want to know<br />why a guy like Falcone
5844798 5845799 would owe you anything.
5845882 5848218 [Shouts] Because he's my father!
5857352 5860147 My mother worked at the 44 below.
5861648 5862941 Just like anni.
5865110 5867654 She used to take me there<br />when I was a little girl.
5869740 5871074 To the club?
5871992 5872993 Yeah.
5875704 5878582 I hid out in the dressing room<br />while she worked.
5879041 5880792 Used to see him there.
5881543 5883545 He scared the shit out of me.
5885505 5888967 And I could never understand<br />why he looked at me the way he did.
5889509 5893346 Then one night,<br />my mother told me who he was.
5896725 5899061 When I was seven,<br />my mother was murdered.
5899728 5901229 Strangled.
5901646 5905108 Never found out who.<br />Probably some creep from the club.
5906985 5909071 Anyway, social services<br />came to take me away,
5909154 5911323 and he didn't say a thing.
5913158 5914951 Couldn't even look at me.
5918705 5920457 He owes me that money.
5922250 5923668 I'm sorry.
5924795 5925962 For what I said.
5927339 5928757 Oh, it's all right.
5929466 5930466 [Chuckles dryly]
5932302 5934387 You assume the worst in people.
5935305 5936681 Which, well...
5938975 5940894 Maybe we're not so different after all.
5946358 5948110 Who are you under there?
5954199 5956076 What are you hiding?
5958453 5960288 Are you just...
5961873 5963583 Hideously scarred?
5965710 5966711 Yeah.
5967671 5969005 [Chuckles lightly]
5973969 5975387 Listen to me.
5976930 5979808 If we don't stand up for Annika,<br />no one will.
5980976 5985647 All anyone cares about in this place<br />are these white, privileged assholes.
5986273 5989359 The mayor, the commissioner, the da.
5989442 5990694 Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.
5990777 5992057 I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
5992112 5994156 that psycho's right<br />to go after these creeps.
5994239 5995490 I think you'd be on his side.
5995574 5997254 What do you mean,<br />"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?
5997284 5999244 What, do you live in a cave?
5999327 6001413 The riddler's latest.<br />It's all about the waynes.
6002497 6006376 Listen, if I can find<br />that dickbag Kenzie,
6006459 6007669 will you help me?
6008920 6010213 Please.
6013008 6014926 Come on, vengeance.
6017387 6019639 Just don't make any moves without me,<br />understand?
6019723 6021483 It's a little more dangerous<br />than you know...
6021641 6023560 [Romantic music playing]
6030901 6032444 I told you, baby.
6034362 6036948 I can take care of myself.
6047751 6051046 [Thomas] I'm Thomas Wayne,<br />and I approve this message.
6051296 6053298 [Triumphant music playing]
6058887 6062474 From a very young age, my family,<br />Martha's family, the arkhams...
6062599 6064434 Instilled in both of us
6064643 6067062 that giving back<br />is not just an obligation,
6067229 6068688 it's a passion.
6069397 6071733 That is our family's legacy.
6072943 6075278 [Riddler on TV]<br />The waynes and the arkhams.
6075362 6077822 Gotham's founding families.
6077906 6081076 But what is their real legacy?
6082410 6087082 Twenty years ago, one reporter set out<br />to uncover the dark truth.
6087165 6090835 He found shocking family secrets.
6091544 6093088 How, when Martha was just a child,
6093171 6095674 her mother brutally murdered her father,
6095757 6097384 -then committed suicide...<br />{Gunshofl
6097467 6103056 and how the arkhams used their power<br />and money to cover it up.
6103139 6107811 How Martha herself was<br />in and out of institutions for years
6107894 6110272 and they didn't want anyone to know.
6111106 6113608 Thomas Wayne tried<br />to force this crusading reporter
6113692 6117612 into a hush-money agreement<br />to save his mayoral campaign.
6117737 6119781 [Raises voice]<br />But when the reporter refused...
6120282 6124577 Wayne turned to longtime<br />secret associate carmine Falcone
6124661 6127247 [laughs hysterically]<br />And had him murdered!
6127372 6130417 {gunshofl<br />-the waynes and the arkhams,
6131001 6136256 Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.
6136756 6139134 I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.
6139217 6141594 This is your legacy too.
6141678 6145140 And Gotham needs you to answer
6145223 6148018 [whispering]<br />For the sins of your father.
6149561 6151396 Goodbye.
6153356 6155275 [Club music playing on speakers]
6157152 6158236 Do you know who I am?
6159863 6160989 You're Bruce Wayne.
6161072 6162949 I wanna see carmine Falcone.

6186014 6188641 [Falcone] Who is this guy<br />who invented the ball, right?
6189392 6191519 Must have made a fortune.
6191978 6193858 If you think about it,<br />the concept of it, right?
6195231 6197692 Briscoe, do you know<br />how much this sweater cost?
6197776 6198777 [Briscoe] No, boss.
6198860 6201196 [Falcone] $1,183.
6201780 6203740 You know why communism failed, right?
6203823 6204824 [Briscoe] No, boss.
6206743 6207994 [Falcone] Austerity.
6208203 6209245 [Men laugh]
6210246 6211873 [Penguin] All right. All right.
6212165 6214542 [Falcone chuckles]<br />Look at that. Perfect.
6214626 6216426 [Penguin]<br />It's never gonna be that good again.
6218588 6221091 Hey, Johnny slick.
6221174 6222342 What are you doing here?
6224260 6226096 Give us a moment here, fellas.
6227013 6228056 [Penguin] Come on.
6229974 6231184 See ya, champ.
6232185 6233436 Come on, sweetheart.
6235397 6236398 Have a seat.
6238441 6240235 I thought I might hear from you.
6241403 6244531 This, uh,<br />riddler son of a bitch is really...
6246074 6247867 Stirring things up, huh?
6247951 6249661 - Is it true?<br />- What?
6250954 6252580 That reporter business?
6253915 6255184 What do you want to know here, kid?
6255208 6258002 Did you kill him? For my father?
6258086 6260839 Look, your father was in trouble.
6261714 6263508 This reporter had some dirt.
6263591 6265218 Some very...
6266386 6270140 Personal stuff about your mother,<br />her family history.
6270223 6272934 Everybody's got their dirty laundry,<br />that's just how it is.
6273017 6274537 But he didn't want<br />none of it coming out,
6274561 6276479 not right before the election.
6276938 6279232 And your father tried<br />to pay the guy off,
6279315 6280942 but he wasn't going for it.
6281025 6284195 So, he came to me.
6284279 6286656 Well, I never seen him like that.
6287490 6289325 He said, "carmine,
6290118 6294831 I want you to put the fear of god<br />in this guy."
6297250 6300170 And when fear isn't enough...
6300837 6302672 Oof. Hmm.
6304007 6307343 Your father wanted me to handle it,<br />so I did.
6308344 6310180 I handled it.
6311890 6313308 I know.
6313391 6315643 You thought your father was a boy scout.
6316895 6318730 But you'd be surprised
6318813 6321191 what even a good man like him
6321274 6323860 is capable of in the right situation.
6326112 6327572 Do me a favor.
6327906 6329949 Don't lose any sleep over it.
6330658 6332243 This reporter
6333077 6334662 was a lowlife.
6334746 6336206 He was on maroni's payroll.
6337832 6339459 - Maroni?<br />- Oh, yeah.
6340210 6343463 He could never stand<br />your father and I had history.
6344881 6348384 And after what happened<br />with that reporter, maroni was worried
6348468 6350803 that your father would be in my pocket,
6351554 6352555 forever.
6353223 6355266 He would have done anything
6355350 6357519 to keep him from becoming mayor.
6357602 6358937 You understand?
6360146 6364692 Are you saying Salvatore maroni<br />got my father killed?
6364776 6366819 Do I know it for a fact?
6369239 6371324 I'm just saying,<br />it sure looked that way to me.
6372700 6374994 This is what you wanted, huh?
6375078 6377497 This little conversation here?
6377997 6379415 [Exhales ruefully]
6379916 6382085 It's been a long time coming, huh?
6384712 6386839 I mean, you ain't a kid no more.
6390301 6392387 [Melancholy music playing]
6436514 6438474 [EKG machine beeping]
6441936 6443605 [Inhales sharply]
6448860 6450612 [Rain pattering]
6453406 6454490 [Sighs]
6456242 6457535 You lied to me...
6460371 6461998 My whole life.
6467170 6469213 I spoke to carmine Falcone.
6472300 6475595 He told me what he did for my father.
6479599 6481100 About Salvatore maroni.
6483102 6485813 He told you Salvatore maroni...
6485897 6487649 Had my father killed.
6490109 6492320 Why didn't you tell me all this?
6495073 6499619 All these years<br />I've spent fighting for him,
6499702 6502038 believing that he was a good man.
6502121 6503706 He was a good man.
6504874 6506584 You listen to me.
6506668 6510088 Your father was a good man.
6513716 6515635 - He made a mistake.<br />- A "mistake."
6515718 6517637 He had a man killed.
6519972 6523226 [Sighing] To protect his family image?
6524310 6525561 His political aspirations?
6525645 6529190 It wasn't to protect the family image,<br />and he didn't have anyone killed.
6531776 6533319 He was protecting your mother.
6534278 6537824 He didn't care about his image<br />or the campaign, any of that.
6537907 6540034 He cared about her,
6540118 6541411 and you,
6541494 6544414 and in a moment of weakness,<br />he turned to Falcone.
6544497 6547959 But he never thought Falcone<br />would kill that man.
6548835 6552171 Your father should have known<br />that Falcone would do anything
6552255 6555383 to finally have something on him<br />that he could use.
6555466 6557301 That's who Falcone is.
6559554 6561764 And that was your father's mistake.
6561848 6563891 But when Falcone<br />told him what he'd done,
6563975 6566728 your father was distraught.
6567603 6570815 He told Falcone<br />he was going to the police,
6570898 6573067 that he would confess everything.
6574569 6576571 And that night,
6576654 6580575 your father and your mother were killed.
6582994 6585163 [Soft music playing]
6586080 6587832 It was Falcone?
6592336 6593796 [Smacks lips]
6593880 6596007 Oh, I wish I knew for sure.
6600720 6604265 Or maybe it was some random thug<br />on the street
6604348 6607101 who needed money, got scared,<br />and pulled the trigger too fast.
6607185 6612398 If you don't think I've spent every day<br />searching for that answer...
6614150 6618029 It was my job to protect them.<br />Do you understand?
6618696 6620490 I know you always blamed yourself.
6620573 6623117 You were only a boy, Bruce.
6625286 6627580 I could see the fear in your eyes,
6628998 6631375 but I didn't know how to help.
6631459 6633961 I could teach you how to fight, [sighs]
6635338 6638007 But I wasn't equipped<br />to take care of you.
6638090 6639926 You needed a father.
6641886 6644305 And all you had was me.
6646682 6647892 I'm sorry.
6649644 6651562 Don't be sorry, Alfred.
6658361 6659445 God.
6662490 6666911 I never thought<br />I'd feel fear like that again.
6669622 6671749 I thought I'd mastered all that.
6678172 6679423 I mean,
6680633 6682760 I'm not afraid to die.
6684512 6686889 I realize now there's something
6688015 6689892 I haven't got past.
6690810 6692562 This fear...
6695022 6697984 Of ever going through any of that again.
6702238 6704448 Of losing somebody I care about.
6705783 6708077 [Soft music continues]
6732393 6734103 [Soft dramatic music playing]
6737106 6738774 [Engine revving]
6755041 6756041 Hey.
6756083 6758836 I saw the signal. That's not you?
6758920 6760838 I thought it was you.
6765009 6766385 [Both grunting]
6773768 6775311 - I found him!<br />- I see that.
6775394 6776896 He had my shit and my phone.
6776979 6778248 She left a message<br />the night they took her.
6778272 6779190 She called me...
6779273 6780983 Gordon! Help me out, man!
6781067 6782360 She got my gun!
6782610 6783611 [Grunts]
6783694 6785404 - Shut up!<br />- Put the gun down.
6786948 6789492 I'm telling you, god damn it!<br />She called me!
6794080 6796165 - [Cell phone beeps]<br />- Here. Listen.
6798125 6799794 [Kenzie on recording]<br />Hey! Get back here!
6799919 6802119 - [Annika whimpering]<br />- Where you going? Come back here!
6802171 6804256 [Falcone] Hey, hey,<br />what are you doing, Kenzie?
6804340 6805675 You're scaring her.
6805758 6807468 [Kenzie] I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.
6807551 6808654 [Annika, tearfully]<br />Please, please, please.
6808678 6809971 Please, don't hurt me, please.
6810054 6812723 [Falcone]<br />Hey, don't be scared. Come here.
6814600 6816644 Now let me ask you again.
6817353 6819897 - What did Mitchell tell you?<br />- [Annika] No, nothing. He...
6819981 6822900 [Falcone] Don liked to talk.<br />I know that.
6822984 6825695 Especially to pretty girls like you.
6826237 6828239 That's why I made him<br />take your passport...
6828948 6831826 Until we could have<br />this little conversation.
6831909 6834620 [Annika] All I want to do<br />is get out of here, okay?
6834704 6836890 You'll never hear from me again,<br />nobody will. Please, please...
6836914 6840042 [Falcone] We're gonna get you<br />out of here, ipromise.
6840876 6843421 But first, I gotta know...
6844505 6845840 What did he tell you?
6846632 6850177 [Annika] He just said<br />they all made a deal with you.
6850678 6851887 [Falcone] Oh. Hmm.
6851971 6853931 He told you about that, huh?
6854015 6855307 The deal.
6855391 6860312 [Annika] He said you gave some<br />information on some drops thing
6860396 6863107 and that's how he became mayor.
6863190 6865568 He said you were a very important man.
6865651 6866777 [Falcone] Right.
6867528 6868904 Mm-hmm.
6869864 6872033 Hmm. Okay.
6874118 6875870 - [Tussling on recording]<br />- [Annika screams]
6876829 6878349 - [Annika cries]<br />- [Tussling continues]
6879707 6881101 - [Falcone] Just take it easy.<br />- [Annika choking]
6881125 6882668 Jesus, he's strangling her.
6882752 6885796 [Falcone] Take it easy.
6887923 6889341 [Recording stops]
6895014 6896307 Rata alada.
6901062 6902855 A falcon has wings too.
6903189 6905024 Falcone is the rat?
6915993 6919163 Falcone works for you guys?
6919830 6922374 The mayor? The da?
6926796 6928297 [Breathing shakily]
6929548 6930841 We work for him.
6931842 6933094 Everybody does.
6933177 6934178 How?
6934261 6935846 Through renewal.
6936639 6938015 Renewal is everything.
6938099 6939499 - The renewal fund?<br />- [Kenzie] Yeah.
6940017 6943729 After Thomas Wayne died,<br />they all went after it like vultures.
6943813 6947399 The mayor, Falcone, maroni.<br />Everyone got in on it.
6947483 6950861 It was perfect for making bribes,<br />laundering money.
6950945 6953030 A huge charitable fund<br />with no oversight.
6953114 6954824 Everybody got a piece.
6954907 6956742 But Falcone wanted more.
6958536 6961747 So he orchestrated a play<br />to take maroni down big.
6963165 6965501 He'd rat out his drops operation,
6965876 6968587 make the careers of everybody<br />that went after him,
6968671 6971132 then install them all as his puppets.
6971215 6973759 You think this goddamn election matters?
6975386 6977304 Falcone's the mayor.
6978264 6980766 He's been the mayor<br />for the last 20 years.
6980850 6982226 Come on, vengeance.
6982935 6984770 Let's go kill that son of a bitch.
6985479 6987319 - This creep too. Let's finish this.<br />- Oh, god!
6988149 6989150 [Gun clatters]
6989483 6990693 We'll get him.
6991360 6993237 - But not that way.<br />- There is no other way!
6993320 6994446 He owns the city!
6994530 6995781 Cross that line...
6996574 6997867 You'll becomejust like him.
6998576 7000119 Listen to me.
7000202 7002079 Don't throw your life away.
7008627 7010004 Don't worry, honey.
7013090 7014550 I got nine of 'em.
7014675 7016635 - [Screams]<br />- [Gordon] No, don't! Hey, hey!
7017928 7019221 [Kenzie] Oh, god! [Whimpering]
7028522 7029791 [Gordon]<br />She won't get out of there alive.
7029815 7032401 And if she kills Falcone,<br />we may never find the riddler.
7032484 7033485 I have to stop her.
7033652 7034652 Don't you mean "we"?
7035946 7037489 I gotta do this my way.
7037823 7038824 And then what?
7039700 7041076 We do what riddler said.
7041911 7043537 Bring the rat into the light.
7046540 7048459 [Dramatic music playing]
7052171 7053881 [Engine roaring]
7079490 7081533 Can you tell Mr. Falcone<br />I'd like to come up?
7081617 7083077 He ain't seein' nobody tonight.
7083702 7085037 Tell him it's about Annika.
7090459 7091877 Look who it is, huh?
7091961 7094380 - Sorry to bother you.<br />- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.
7094463 7096465 I was just hoping<br />I could talk to you for a minute?
7096632 7098092 Absolutely.
7099843 7100844 Alone?
7101470 7102471 [Banging on door]
7104348 7106392 [Muffled club music playing]
7118779 7120489 [Club music playing on speakers]
7129039 7130308 [Tearfully] I'm just so worried.
7130332 7131959 I don't know where she is.
7133711 7137089 And I know<br />that you're a very important man.
7137172 7140592 I was hoping that maybe<br />you could help me find her...
7142094 7144471 Because she's been gone so long,<br />I'm beginning to...
7144638 7145848 [Inhales shakily]
7145931 7147057 I'm sorry. [Sniffling]
7147266 7148350 It's okay.
7148434 7150561 - I'm so sorry.<br />- I understand. Here.
7150728 7153605 No, that's okay, I have a tissue.
7157860 7158777 Mr. Falcone?
7158861 7160321 Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?
7160404 7163324 I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think<br />you're gonna want to see this.
7165701 7167202 [Falcone] I'm sorry, beautiful.
7167286 7168704 I'll be right back.
7174835 7176545 [Dramatic music playing]
7183093 7183927 [Indistinct TV chatter]
7184011 7185095 Holy shit.

7186930 7189641 by lieutenant James Gordon<br />of the Gotham pd.
7189725 7192561 And we should warn you,<br />the contents are extremely graphic
7192644 7194855 and some of you may find it disturbing.
7195481 7198984 [Annika, tearfully] He just said<br />they all made a deal with you.
7199109 7200652 [Falcone] Oh. Hmm.
7200819 7202488 He told you about that, huh?
7202571 7204073 The deal.
7204156 7208952 [Annika] He said you gave some<br />information on some drops thing
7209036 7211955 and that's how he became mayor.
7212039 7214583 He said you were a very important man.
7214666 7215667 [Falcone] Right.
7216543 7217753 Hmm.
7217836 7219046 Okay.
7220756 7222591 - [Tussling on recording]<br />- [Annika screams]

7234353 7236397 I'm Maria Kyle's kid.
7238023 7239483 You remember her?
7241527 7242569 Yeah.
7246865 7248009 Just put down the gun, honey.

7442269 7444771 and all of a sudden,<br />some big secret's comin' out?
7444855 7446481 Let me tell you something.
7446565 7448275 Whatever I know,
7448358 7450235 whatever I've done,
7450319 7454656 it's all going with me to my grave.
7465208 7467169 What, are you with Zorro over here?

7492736 7496239 Anything you say can and will<br />be used against you in a court of law.
7496323 7497683 You have the right to an attorney.
7497741 7498909 If you cannot afford one,
7498992 7500786 the city of Gotham<br />will provide one to you.
7500869 7502579 Do you understand these rights?

7824609 7828154 He scrawled all over 'em.<br />Rambling, ciphers, codes.
7828238 7829781 Got something back on one of the ids.

7836663 7838415 What about chain of evidence?
7839249 7840458 You should see this.
7846423 7847924 He's wearing gloves.
7849384 7851636 "Friday, July 16th.
7851720 7855432 My life has been a cruel riddle<br />I could not solve,
7855765 7858810 suffocating my mind, no escape.
7858893 7860311 But then, today, I saw it.
7860395 7864524 A single word on this ledger,<br />sitting on the desk beside me.
7865859 7867652 'Renewal.'
7867736 7872157 the empty promise they sold to me<br />as a child in that orphanage.
7872240 7875368 One look inside,<br />and finally I understood.
7875452 7878788 My whole life<br />has been preparing me for this.
7878872 7881332 The moment when I would learn the truth.
7881416 7884419 When I could finally strike back<br />and expose their lies."
7885545 7887440 - [Rats squeaking]<br />- _"|f you want people to understand,
7887464 7889299 really understand,
7889382 7891676 you can't just give them the answers.
7891760 7893219 You have to confront them,
7893303 7895722 torture them<br />with the horrifying questions,
7895805 7897974 just like they tortured me.
7898058 7900852 I know now what I must become."

7905315 7906483 [Bat screeching]
7911237 7913198 I don't think that rat likes you, man.

7921873 7922916 [Screeching violently]
7931883 7933009 [Gordon] What is that?
7935720 7937222 [Bat screeching frantically]
7964624 7965893 [Officer] Some kind of pry tool?
7965917 7967293 Is it a chisel?
7967377 7968837 [Batman] It's a murder weapon.
7968920 7970296 He killed Mitchell with it.
7970964 7973842 The edge will match the floorboard<br />impression in the mayor's study.
7982433 7984435 "My confession"?
7984519 7987397 What's he confessing to?<br />He already told us he killed Mitchell.
7987480 7988857 This isn't over.
7988940 7991460 [Officer 2] Oh, man. He's been posting<br />all kinds of shit online.
7991776 7993987 He's got, like, 500 followers.<br />Real fringe types.
7994362 7995655 [Typing]
8002078 8004289 His final post was last night.
8004372 8007584 Some video. Got a lot of views,<br />but it's password-protected.
8007667 8010670 - [Gordon] Can you get in?<br />- [Officer 2] Copying his drive now.
8010795 8014215 Take some time, but we'll get in.
8014716 8016301 [Ominous music playing]
8025560 8028104 - [Gordon] Show me the post.<br />- [Officer 2] It's right here.
8029731 8031441 [Gordon] "The truth unmasked."
8032275 8033902 I think I'm his last target.
8036487 8037572 You?
8037947 8039991 Maybe this is all coming to an end.
8040533 8041910 What is?
8042368 8043786 The Batman.
8044037 8045205 [Cell phone ringing]
8049167 8050335 Yeah?
8061638 8062847 Right.
8065725 8069687 Riddler's asking for you. At arkham.
8077153 8078655 You're a good cop.
8103263 8105640 [Over speaker]<br />I told you I'd see you in hell.
8106391 8108226 [Batman] What do you want from me?
8108309 8109852 [Riddler] "Want"?
8110436 8114065 If only you knew how long<br />I've been waiting for this day.
8115275 8116609 For this moment.
8117652 8120655 I've been invisible my whole life.
8121739 8124367 I guess I won't be anymore, will I?
8125910 8128329 They'll remember me now.
8128413 8130248 They'll remember both of us.
8140633 8142593 Bruce...
8145471 8147307 Wayne.
8149684 8153438 [Slowly] Bruce...
8154856 8157734 Wayne.
8163489 8164532 [Exhales deeply]
8168995 8171414 You know, I was there that day.
8174000 8177378 The day the great Thomas Wayne<br />announced he was running for mayor,
8177462 8179839 made all those promises.
8182300 8186554 Well, a week later he was dead,<br />and everybody just forgot about us.
8187096 8190641 All they could talk about<br />was poor Bruce Wayne.
8190725 8194395 Bruce Wayne, the orphan.
8194979 8196522 Orphan.
8202195 8207325 Living in some tower over the park<br />isn't being an orphan.
8208618 8213247 Looking down on everyone,<br />with all that money.
8213915 8215458 Don't you tell me.
8218086 8220755 Do you know what being an orphan is?
8221130 8223716 It's 30 kids to a room.
8225009 8229055 Twelve years old and already a drophead,<br />numbing the pain.
8230765 8235436 You wake up screaming<br />with rats chewing your fingers.
8236604 8239774 And every winter one of the babies die
8239857 8242151 because it's so cold.
8243444 8246030 But, oh, no.
8247323 8248574 [Smacks lips]
8248950 8252120 Let's talk about the billionaire<br />with the lying, dead daddy
8252203 8255123 because at least the money<br />makes it go down easy.
8255206 8256207 Doesn't it?
8257667 8259710 Bruce...
8260753 8262672 Wayne.
8266342 8269429 He's the only one we didn't get.
8272849 8275977 But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?
8277437 8281315 All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.
8284485 8285653 God.
8286654 8287947 Look at you.
8289615 8292076 Your mask is amazing.
8292160 8295079 I wish you could've seen me in mine.
8295163 8296247 Ain't it funny?
8296330 8300751 All everyone wants to do is unmask you,<br />but they're missing the point.
8302211 8304255 You and I both know
8305214 8307717 I'm looking at the real you right now.
8307800 8311429 My mask allowed me<br />to be myself completely.
8311512 8313055 No shame,
8313973 8314974 no limits.
8315057 8316726 Why did you write me?
8317602 8318603 What do you mean?
8318686 8320396 All those cards.
8320480 8321689 I told you,
8322398 8324376 we've been doing this together.<br />You're a part of this.
8324400 8326611 - We didn't do anything together.<br />- We did.
8326694 8328154 What did we just do?
8328237 8330299 I asked you to bring him into the light,<br />and you did.
8330323 8331491 We're such a good team.
8331574 8332575 We're not a team.
8332658 8335161 I never could have<br />gotten him out of there.
8335244 8337663 I'm not physical.<br />My strength is up here.
8337747 8340917 I mean, I had all the pieces,<br />I had the answers.
8341000 8342640 But I didn't know<br />how to make them listen.
8342710 8343920 You gave me that.
8344003 8345129 I gave you nothing.
8345213 8347798 You showed me what was possible.
8347882 8352762 You showed me all it takes is fear<br />and a little focused violence.
8352845 8354388 You inspired me.
8354472 8355973 You're out of your goddamn mind.
8357099 8358184 What?
8358267 8360436 This is all in your head.<br />You're sick, twisted.
8360520 8361896 How can you say that?
8361979 8363481 You think you'll be remembered?
8363564 8365233 You're a pathetic psychopath,
8365733 8367485 - begging for attention.<br />- No.
8367568 8369237 - You're gonna die alone in arkham.<br />- No.
8369320 8370363 No, no!
8370446 8371446 A nobody!
8376869 8379247 Ahhh!
8379497 8382083 This is not how this was supposed to go!
8383042 8386671 Ahhh!
8386754 8389382 I had it all planned out!
8390383 8392385 We were gonna be safe here.
8392760 8396055 We could watch the whole thing together.
8396138 8397139 Watch what?
8397223 8398975 Everything!
8400726 8402144 [Tense music playing]
8407316 8408985 It was all there.
8411153 8413489 You mean, you didn't figure it out?
8414657 8415866 [Riddler gasps slowly]
8417785 8421706 Oh, you're really not as smart<br />as I thought you were.
8423749 8425835 I guess I gave you too much credit.
8426294 8427545 What have you done?
8428254 8433134 What's black and blue and dead all over?
8435970 8437805 You.
8439473 8441601 If you think you can stop<br />what's coming...
8442935 8444478 What have you done?
8446022 8451861 [Sings in falsetto] Ave Maria
8452278 8454155 [shouting] What have you done?

8506916 8508209 What are you doing in here?
8526143 8528729 Hey, man, I don't think that<br />you should be touching that.
8532233 8533233 [Bottles clink]
8535319 8537780 Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?
8538656 8541409 Killing Mitchell<br />with a friggin' carpet tool.
8546080 8549125 My uncle's a... he's an installer.
8549208 8551377 You know, it's a... oh, you know.
8551460 8553713 It's a Tucker.

8622615 8624033 [Riddler] Hey, guys.
8624366 8626577 Uh, thanks for all the comments
8626660 8629622 and a special thanks to everyone<br />for the tips on detonators.
8629705 8630706 Detonators?
8630790 8635836 I just want to say this will be my last<br />post for a little while, and, uh...
8638088 8640174 What this community has meant to me
8640257 8643260 these weeks, these months,
8644178 8646597 let's just say none of us...
8648307 8650434 Is alone anymore. Okay?
8651143 8652228 Jesus.
8652520 8653562 [Riddler huffing]
8655564 8656565 [Inhales deeply]
8656690 8659276 Tomorrow's election day.
8659443 8661070 [Laughing]
8661862 8664490 And Bella real will win.
8664573 8667201 She promised real change.
8667910 8670287 But we know the truth, don't we?
8670371 8672456 You've seen Gotham's true face now.
8672540 8674416 Together, we've unmasked it.
8674500 8677461 Its corruption, its perversion
8677545 8681382 masquerading under the guise of renewal.
8681465 8685302 But unmasking is not enough.
8687513 8691517 The day of judgment is finally upon us.
8691600 8693978 [In playful tone] And now it is time
8695062 8697439 for retribution.
8697523 8700317 I've parked seven vans
8700609 8702945 all along the city seawall.
8704154 8706031 And on the big night,
8706115 8708367 [whispers] They will go boom.
8712121 8713831 [Dramatic music playing]
8719253 8720671 [Explosion]
8722631 8723911 - [Explosion]<br />- [Inaudible] Boom!
8729138 8730598 - [Explosion]<br />- [Inaudible] Boom!
8733267 8735519 When the vans blow,
8735603 8741233 the flooding will happen so fast,<br />evacuation will not be an option.
8741567 8744528 Those who are not washed away
8744612 8747615 will race through the streets in terror.
8747781 8748842 - [Panicked screams]<br />- Call Gordon.
8748866 8750993 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
8752578 8754264 - [Crowd cheering]<br />- [Riddler] As breaking news
8754288 8756206 hits higher ground<br />in Gotham square garden...
8756332 8759293 Celebrations will turn to panic,
8759376 8764214 as the venue becomes<br />the city's shelter of last resort.
8764298 8765466 [Sirens wailing]
8765591 8769595 And that's where all of you come in.
8776018 8779313 Now, when the time arrives,<br />I will already be unmasked.
8779396 8781565 The pigs will have me in their custody,
8781649 8783692 but that's okay.
8783776 8788280 Because then it will be your turn.
8788364 8792242 You'll be there, waiting.
8792451 8794244 [Dramatic music playing]
8803295 8806215 It's time for the lies to finally end.
8806298 8810427 [Dramatically]<br />False promises of renewal?
8810511 8811595 Change?
8812012 8815808 We'll give them real, real change now.
8815891 8820896 We've spent our lives in this<br />wretched place, [shouts] Suffering!
8821355 8823857 Wondering, "why us?"
8823941 8827069 Now they will spend<br />their last moments wondering,
8827152 8829321 [screams] Why them?
8829405 8831448 I can't get through! The lines are down.
8832783 8834076 [Sirens wailing]
8837079 8839248 Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!
8839832 8841458 I'm just trying to get out of town, man!
8841542 8844420 Lady, we got bombs going off.<br />The whole city's flooding.
8844503 8846523 You're gonna have to go inside<br />the garden with everyone else.
8846547 8847589 [Distant explosion]
8848007 8849633 [People screaming]
8851593 8852678 [Crowd clamoring]
8853637 8854637 [Sirens wailing]
8856098 8857826 - Lieutenant, who's in charge?<br />- I really don't know.
8857850 8859411 We're just trying<br />to get a handle here, sir.
8859435 8861270 Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!
8861353 8862604 We got an active situation.
8862730 8864082 We need to sweep the building<br />for explosives
8864106 8865375 and get the mayor-elect<br />out of here, now.
8865399 8866316 - Where is she?<br />- I can take you there.
8866400 8867234 Come!
8867317 8868610 [Crowd chattering]
8870237 8871321 [Tense music playing]
8903270 8904748 - [Man] If we don't close the doors...<br />- Mcu.
8904772 8905647 We're gonna have huge problems.
8905731 8907167 The water's already started to breach.
8907191 8908793 I thought this was<br />a shelter of last resort.
8908817 8911087 [Man] Yeah, for a hurricane,<br />but not if the whole seawall comes down.
8911111 8913006 [Bella] I am not gonna let<br />those people die out there.
8913030 8915425 All right. I'll go calm down the crowd<br />so we can get everyone in.
8915449 8917761 It's not safe for you here.<br />We need to get you out, Ms. Real.
8917785 8920037 - I'm not going anywhere.<br />- We're under attack, ma'am.
8920120 8921955 Exactly! That's the problem<br />with this city.
8922039 8925042 Everyone's afraid to stand up<br />and do the right thing, but I'm not.
8925125 8926627 - Excuse me.<br />- Ma'am...
8931799 8935260 Everyone, everyone,<br />if I could just get your attention.
8935344 8937638 Please! I just need your attention!

9517967 9520261 [Bruce] Wednesday, November 6th.
9520428 9522097 [Siren wailing in distance]
9523473 9525350 The city is unden/vater.
9527686 9529437 The national guard is coming.
9531731 9533733 Martial law is in effect...
9534651 9536277 But the criminal element never sleeps.
9539489 9543201 Looting and lawlessness will be rampant
9543284 9545829 in the parts of the city<br />no one can get to.
9546996 9550709 I can already see things will get worse<br />before they get better.
9553670 9556798 And some will seize the chance<br />to grab everything they can.
9558174 9559551 [Bella] We will rebuild.
9560176 9561636 But not just our city.
9562345 9566558 We must rebuild people's faith<br />in our institutions,
9566641 9568727 in our elected officials,
9568810 9570103 in each other.
9570895 9574232 Together, we will learn<br />to believe in Gotham again.
9574399 9575479 [Woman speaks indistinctly]
9575608 9576901 [Helicopter blades whirring]
9578570 9580238 [Bruce] I'm starting to see now.
9581698 9583867 I have had an effect here...
9585952 9587871 But not the one I intended.
9590248 9593293 Vengeance won't change the past,
9594627 9597005 mine or anyone else's.
9599424 9601468 I have to become more.
9604554 9606181 People need hope.
9607390 9609601 To know someone's out there for them.
9613396 9615064 The city's angry,
9615982 9617358 scarred,
9618276 9619527 like me.
9621654 9623740 Our scars can destroy us.
9625116 9627827 Even after<br />the physical wounds have healed.
9629454 9631206 But if we survive them,
9632707 9634584 they can transform us.
9636461 9638379 They can give us the power
9639339 9640840 to endure...
9642217 9644344 And the strength to fight.
9647263 9649432 [Reporter]<br />We are live. As you can see,
9649516 9652310 the masked vigilante<br />atop Gotham square garden
9652393 9653978 helping to save the lives
9654062 9655748 - of hundreds of victims.<br />- [Riddler moaning]
9655772 9658775 And now as first responders desperately<br />scramble to help the injured,
9658858 9661402 a mysterious masked man emerges,
9661486 9663881 heroically pulling the victims<br />right through that skylight...
9663905 9666366 [Man] Isn't that just terrible?
9667742 9669661 Him...
9669744 9672622 Raining on your parade like that?
9672789 9673915 [Tutting]
9678336 9680338 What is it they say?
9681506 9683675 "One day you're on top,
9685218 9686886 the next...
9688263 9690181 You're a clown."
9690849 9692225 [Exhales ruefully]
9692559 9693726 Well,
9695520 9698356 let me tell you,<br />there are worse things to be.
9698565 9699649 [Riddler weeping]
9700650 9703319 Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.
9704612 9706447 You did so well.
9710952 9711953 And you know,
9713621 9716833 Gotham loves a comeback story.
9726885 9728261 [Riddler] Who are you?
9728803 9731222 [Man] Well, that's the question,
9732473 9733641 isn't it?
9736561 9738938 Riddle me this...
9741399 9743526 "The less of them you have,
9744277 9748114 the more one is worth."
9753536 9755288 A friend.
9759417 9760835 [Laughing maniacally]
9766799 9769010 [Both laughing maniacally]
9781522 9782922 - [Batman] You're leaving.<br />- {933931

9798706 9800416 Bludhaven, maybe.
9803503 9804712 You asking me to stay?
9811761 9813888 You know this place<br />is never gonna change.
9814305 9816641 With carmine gone,<br />it's only gonna get worse for you.
9816724 9818643 There's gonna be a power grab.
9820269 9821396 It'll be bloody.
9822021 9823231 I know.
9824774 9825858 But the city can change.
9825942 9827193 It won't.
9828319 9829320 I have to try.
9829404 9831204 It's gonna kill you eventually.<br />You know that.
9833491 9834617 Listen.
9837036 9838287 Why don't you come with me?
9839247 9840748 Get into some trouble.
9841499 9845003 Knock off some ceo hedge fund types.<br />It'll be fun.
