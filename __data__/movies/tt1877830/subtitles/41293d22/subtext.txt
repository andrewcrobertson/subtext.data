116825 119411 [newscaster on TV]<br />...a dark and stormy Halloween.
119870 122372 [news jingle plays on TV]
123498 126418 Good evening and welcome to<br />GC-1 News live at 8:00.
126501 128045 Our top story tonight,
128128 130464 Just-released polls have<br />incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.
130547 134384 and 28-year-old grassroots challenger<br />Bella Real in a dead heat.
134468 135969 Things certainly got hot last night
136053 139514 in their final debate<br />before next Tuesday's election.
139598 143644 Now, my young opponent here wants to<br />gut the Gotham Renewal Program,
143727 145479 established by the great Thomas Wayne.
145562 148315 Cutting funds from vital projects<br />like our sea wall
148398 149858 and the safety net<br />for those who need it.
149941 154112 The Renewal Program is broken.<br />This city's been renewing for 20 years.
154196 156990 Look where it's gotten us.<br />Crime has skyrocketed.
157074 158450 Murder and drug use<br />are at historic highs.
158480 159504 Now wait... Now hang on.
159534 161787 We have a masked vigilante<br />running the street.
161817 162966 Under my administration,
162996 166792 the Gotham PD has dealt major blows<br />to organized crime and drug trafficking.
166875 170379 The Salvatore Maroni case was<br />the biggest drug bust in city history.
170462 172756 But drops and other drugs<br />are still rampant.
172786 173852 It's gotten worse.
173882 175175 I'm not saying there isn't work to do.
175205 176271 - But listen...<br />- [phone rings]
176301 177719 I have a beautiful<br />wife and young son, okay?
177803 179262 - And I will not rest...<br />- [mutes TV]
181598 182891 [picks up phone]
183767 184967 Hey.
185185 186645 [low eerie music playing]
187229 188939 Yeah, I'm watching it now.
189147 190691 [TV muted]
194277 195821 Why is she still tied?
200409 203412 But I thought we were getting<br />a bump in the new Post poll.
210502 212921 Okay, you know what?<br />I can't watch this anymore.
213004 214881 Just call me in the morning, okay?
214965 216165 [phone beeps]
218093 220512 [Don on TV]...who still believes in<br />everything this city can do.
220595 223140 [Bella] We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,<br />not a cheerleader.
223223 225892 And someone who will<br />tell the people the truth.
226017 227310 [applause on TV]
227436 228636 [switches TV off]
235652 237112 [masked man yells]

247164 248707 [panting heavily]
259676 261595 [exhales slowly]
267267 272564 [breathing deeply and heavily]
304679 307682 [Bruce] Thursday, October 31st.
308475 309675 [crackling]
317567 319778 [car horns honking]
320529 323281 The city streets are crowded<br />for the holiday.
326451 328119 Even with the rain.
328870 330872 [chatter and laughter]
331623 335085 Hidden in the chaos is the element,
336002 338088 waiting to strike like snakes.
339589 341091 But I'm there too.
342133 343844 Watching.
345428 349850 Two years of nights have turned me<br />into a nocturnal animal.
355230 358024 I must choose my targets carefully.
361361 362988 [suspenseful music playing]
368660 370745 - [indistinct TV chatter]<br />- [entry bell chimes]
371663 373498 - [gunman] Come on! Give me the money.<br />- [cashier] Okay.
373665 376293 - [gunman] Let's go! Let's go!<br />- [cashier] All right, all right!
376376 377878 [Bruce] It's a big city.
382507 384217 I can't be everywhere.
387888 389139 - [rowdy laughter]<br />- [grunts]
390515 391892 [cheers and laughter]
394811 396730 But they don't know where I am.
401902 403653 - [laughter]<br />- Look at this guy, man.
408888 410088 Boom!
410118 411318 [gang] Whoo-hoo-hoo!
414915 416750 [gang member 1] So good, man.<br />That's what I'm talking about!
416833 418251 [gang member 2] Yo, let's see your hits.
419085 420462 That's you.
421379 423465 [tense music playing]
440941 444861 [Bruce] We have a signal now.<br />For when I'm needed.
446571 448823 But when that light hits the sky,
449699 451701 it's not just a call.
453286 454829 It's a warning.
456623 457823 To them.
461795 463046 [helicopter blades whirring]
467342 468551 Fear...
469594 471262 [uneasy music playing]
471888 473682 Is a tool.
482565 484401 - [tires screech]<br />- [car horn blares]
484776 487946 [driver] Are you out of your mind?<br />Watch where you're goin', drophead!
499791 502335 [Bruce]<br />They think I'm hiding in the shadows.
502544 503962 [heroic music playing]
504066 505266 [sirens wailing]
505296 506496 [thug] Come on!
514723 516641 [Bruce] But I am the shadows.
522188 523690 [brakes screech]
528382 529582 [PA chimes]
529612 531448 [indistinct announcement on PA]
535410 536995 - [gang leader] Come on, come on.<br />- [gang member] Whoo!
538309 539509 - Hey, go on, man! Go!<br />- Get him!
539539 540999 - Come on, man!<br />- What are you doin'?
541958 543209 - [man] Help!<br />- [gang laughs]
543293 544502 Somebody help me!
545295 547297 Help, help!
549799 551217 [gang jeering]
552949 554149 [gang laughs]
554179 555388 [gang member 1]<br />Where you goin', huh?
555597 557140 [gang member laughing derisively]
559997 561197 Come on.
561227 562896 Come on, man. Break it.
565065 566483 You can't move, huh?
566858 568568 Now knock his ass out.
568651 570361 Showtime. Showtime, man.
570842 572042 Come on, man.
572072 573323 Come on. Do it, man.
574532 576201 [muffled clanging]
576910 579120 - [menacing music playing]<br />- [footsteps approaching]
585043 587212 [footsteps coming closer]
606147 608233 [laughing]
608650 610276 You see this guy?
617492 619119 The hell are you supposed to be?
625834 627252 [gang leader grunting]
630755 631955 [water splashes]
636136 637428 I'm vengeance.
638555 640473 Holy shit. It's him.
647230 648690 [yelps]
652235 653945 [gang grunting]
659075 660275 [chokes]
660451 661651 [grunting]
666166 667366 Hey, man. No, no, no!
672172 673715 [groaning]
706331 707957 [man breathing raggedly]
709042 710418 Please don't hurt me.
722180 724182 [soft music playing]
732273 734108 [hushed chatter]
746454 748039 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
749415 750833 Police action.
751417 753086 He's with me, Officer.
755338 756923 Are you kidding me, sir?
757840 759592 You're gonna let him in here?
760260 763054 Martinez, let him through.
765974 767517 [Martinez sighs]
776693 778444 Goddamn freak.
794335 795535 What do we know?
806264 807640 Detective?
807724 809350 Sorry, Lieutenant.
810226 814731 We got blunt force trauma.<br />Lacerations on the head.
815481 818651 He got hit a lot of times. And hard.
821821 823448 All this blood is from his head?
823906 825106 No.
829245 830455 Excuse me.
832749 834625 Most of it's from his hand.
840089 841289 Thumb was severed.
842759 844969 Killer may have taken it as a trophy.
845345 847263 [Batman]<br />He was alive when it was cut off.
848556 849974 Ecchymosis...
851225 852769 around the wound.
867992 869702 [lead detective]<br />Security detail downstairs
869786 871996 said the family was out<br />trick-or-treatin'.
873498 875708 The mayor was up here alone.
878127 880838 Killer may have come<br />through the skylight.
887220 889013 [Gordon] You said there was a card.
889097 890681 [lead detective] Yeah.
900817 903861 [Gordon] "From your secret friend. Whoo?
905154 906864 Haven't a clue?
906948 909325 Let's play a game, just me and you.
910368 912912 What does a liar do when he's dead?"
914247 916332 There's a cipher too.
923089 924966 Any of this mean anything to you?
927510 928719 What's going on here?
931806 933224 I asked him to come, Pete.
933307 934976 [Pete] This is a crime scene.
935059 937395 It's Mitchell, for christ sakes!
937478 939480 I got the press downstairs.
939564 942316 You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,<br />'cause we got history.
942400 944235 But this is way over the line.
947843 949043 Wait.
949073 950783 - He's involved in this?<br />- No, he's not involved.
950846 952046 How do you know?
952076 955079 He's a goddamn vigilante!<br />He could be a suspect!
955163 956914 What are you doin' to me?<br />We used to be partners.
956998 958624 [Gordon] I'm just trying<br />to find the connection, Pete.
958708 960251 He lies still.
961752 962952 Excuse me?
964297 965497 The riddle.
965965 969385 What does a liar do when he's dead?<br />He lies still.
978519 980021 Oh, Jesus.
983274 986068 This must be your favorite night<br />of the year, huh, pal?
987069 988905 Happy fuckin' Halloween.
989697 991324 [Martinez] Excuse me, Commissioner.
992408 994076 They're ready for your statement.
998122 999832 I want him outta here.
1000458 1001658 Now!
1008132 1009342 Come on.
1013596 1014796 [camera shutter clicking]
1022146 1023356 Yeah.
1024607 1026025 The kid found him.
1031030 1034033 [detective] Was there anyone else<br />in the house when you arrived?
1034283 1036369 [melancholy song playing]
1050466 1052635 We really gotta go, man.
1058224 1061936 [Pete] Tonight, a son lost a father.
1062395 1064230 A wife lost a husband.
1065439 1066983 And I lost a friend.
1068067 1070611 Mayor Mitchell<br />was a fighter for the city,
1070695 1073781 and I will not rest<br />until his killer is found.
1074240 1076409 This was a truly senseless crime,
1077159 1080580 and we are actively pursuing<br />every investigative lead we have
1080663 1084750 in order to identify the perpetrator<br />and hunt him down.
1084834 1086085 I've spoken to the governor...
1086168 1089005 [Bruce] I wish I could say<br />I'm making a difference,
1089088 1090673 but I don't know.
1091090 1093426 [melancholy song continues]
1096596 1099473 Murder, robberies, assault.
1099557 1101642 Two years later, they're all up.
1102393 1103728 And now this.
1105896 1107481 The city's eating itself.
1110192 1111444 Maybe it's beyond saving.
1113529 1115823 But I have to try.
1116616 1117867 Push myself.
1118159 1120328 [melancholy song continues]
1135885 1137428 [engine revving]
1149148 1150566 [bats chittering]
1163954 1166457 These nights all roll together in a rush
1167416 1169335 behind the mask.
1173839 1176133 Sometimes in the morning,
1177927 1180096 I have to force myself to remember
1182473 1184058 everything that happened.
1185059 1186435 [groaning]
1198614 1200199 [newscaster on TV] Unbelievable<br />breaking news this hour, everyone.
1200282 1204161 Again, four-term incumbent<br />Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.
1204245 1207081 was found murdered last night<br />inside his home
1207164 1208916 in the exclusive Crest Hill district.
1208999 1210668 [newscaster 2]<br />Exact details of the crime
1210751 1212253 still have not been released,
1212336 1215214 but a citywide manhunt<br />is already underway
1215297 1218551 as police and FBI search<br />for the brazen Killer.
1218676 1220469 And this certainly is not the first time
1220553 1223097 Gotham has been rocked by<br />the murder of a political figure.
1223180 1227435 In fact, in an eerie coincidence,<br />it was 20 years ago this week
1227518 1229270 that celebrated<br />billionaire philanthropist
1229353 1231313 Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha
1231397 1234233 were slain during Wayne's<br />own mayoral campaign.
1234316 1238154 It was a shocking crime<br />that remains unsolved to this day.
1238237 1240030 Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career
1240114 1242783 was especially notable<br />for his tough war on drugs
1242867 1246120 when he and city police<br />launched a major sting operation,
1246203 1250166 resulting in the arrest of notorious<br />mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni
1250249 1254420 with what, to this day, remains<br />the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.
1254503 1255921 I assume you heard about this.
1256172 1257631 [newscaster 2 continues indistinctly]
1257798 1259049 - Yeah.<br />- [video fast-forwarding]
1266056 1267391 Oh, I see.
1268225 1270144 [Gordon on video]<br />All this blood is from his head?
1270686 1271896 Dear God.
1280654 1282698 [lead detective] There's a cipher too.
1290706 1293000 [Gordon]<br />Any of this mean anything to you?
1293834 1295419 [camera shutter clicking]
1296170 1297963 The killer left this for the Batman?
1299381 1301050 Gordon}<br />I asked him to come, Pete.
1301133 1302333 Apparently.
1302426 1304303 You're becoming quite a celebrity.
1306347 1307681 Why is he writing to you?
1307765 1309183 [Pete]<br />It's Mitchell, for christ sakes!
1309213 1310362 I don't know yet.
1310392 1311936 [Pete] I got the press downstairs.
1313813 1315231 Have a shower.
1316690 1318359 Our accounting friends<br />at Wayne Enterprises
1318389 1319413 are coming for breakfast.
1319443 1321445 Here? Why?
1321475 1322666 Because I couldn't get you to go there.
1322696 1323834 I haven't got time for this.
1323864 1325533 It's getting serious, Bruce.
1325616 1328702 If this continues, it won't be long<br />before you've nothing left.
1328786 1330371 I don't care about that.
1331018 1332218 Any of that.
1332248 1333749 You don't care about<br />your family's legacy?
1336126 1339255 What I'm doing is my family's legacy.
1339338 1341507 If I can't change things here,
1342049 1343968 if I can't have an effect,
1345052 1346679 then I don't care what happens to me.
1346742 1347942 That's what I'm afraid of.
1347972 1349598 Alfred, stop.
1350975 1352434 You're not my father.
1355229 1356647 I'm well aware.
1359942 1362236 [somber music playing]
1363487 1364822 [machine whirs]
1390973 1393225 [Gordon on video]<br />We really gotta go, man.
1402151 1404153 [soft classical music playing]
1418876 1420461 Some fresh berries there.
1427635 1428835 What are you doing?
1429136 1432806 Just reminiscing about<br />my days in the Circus.
1433182 1437102 [inhales sharply]<br />This is actually quite elusive.
1440105 1441774 Where'd you get those O's?
1441899 1443233 [Alfred smacks lips]
1443317 1446111 "He lies still" is only a partial key.
1446195 1448614 It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.
1448697 1452743 So, I'm looking for any double symbols<br />to start, trying letters,
1452826 1454203 see where it leads.
1456121 1457321 That's interesting.
1458374 1459574 [woman] Mr. Pennyworth?
1459875 1461075 Yes, Dory?
1461210 1462670 The accountants are here.
1462753 1464588 See them in, please, Dory.
1467508 1469718 [Bruce] What if it's not a partial key?
1469802 1471387 What do you mean?
1471470 1473305 What if this is the whole key?
1474223 1476767 Ignore the symbols<br />we don't have letters for.
1476850 1478894 Use only the letters from<br />"He lies still" and leave the rest...
1478978 1480178 Blank. Yeah, I understand.
1480229 1482356 But that would leave<br />most of the cipher unsolved.
1482439 1484274 I don't see how that's gonna...
1484858 1486652 [suspenseful music playing]
1486819 1488019 Oh.
1501625 1503293 [Gordon] Damn.
1503460 1505713 Yeah, he's got a car.
1506630 1509008 Guess it's good to be the mayor.
1509091 1510759 Where to even start?
1511343 1513679 You sure this isn't a leap?<br />"Drive" could mean anything.
1513762 1514962 [Batman] You don't trust me?
1515764 1517391 You mean like you trust me?
1517474 1520352 It's been two years now,<br />and I don't even know who you are, man.
1522354 1523554 [Batman] There.
1525983 1527526 [suspenseful music continues]
1535409 1536785 [air hissing]
1546587 1547880 What are we looking for?
1548505 1550049 A USB port.
1550132 1551332 USB?
1551508 1553010 [whirring]
1558348 1559548 What?
1564897 1567149 "Thumb" drive.
1567941 1569568 Jesus.
1573197 1574698 It's encrypted.
1578118 1579411 Try this.
1586418 1588796 Oh, this guy's hilarious.
1593467 1595177 - [key clacks]<br />- [beep]
1597679 1600265 Oh, well, well, well.
1600682 1602935 So much for family values.
1603102 1604302 Who is she?
1604353 1605938 No idea.
1606855 1609691 But that's the Penguin,<br />Carmine Falcone's right hand.
1610025 1611527 - I know who he is.<br />- [notification whooshing]
1611985 1613185 What was that?
1614738 1617574 Shit, shit! The drive.
1618325 1620661 It sent out the photos from my account.
1620744 1623288 Gotham Post, Gazette, GC-1, all of them.
1623372 1625457 Jesus.
1625541 1627918 I'm gonna catch hell for this.<br />Pete's gonna bust a gasket.
1628001 1629461 "He lies still."
1629670 1630870 About her?
1631964 1633549 Maybe.
1633715 1635592 That's the Iceberg Lounge.
1635676 1639096 It's under the Shoreline Lofts<br />where Falcone was holed up.
1639179 1641306 Never get in there without a warrant.
1643642 1644842 Yeah.
1649314 1651233 [train rumbles past]
1656363 1657739 [muffled dance music playing]
1657823 1659032 Know who I am?
1660367 1662619 Yeah. I got an idea.
1663078 1664496 I want to see the Penguin.
1665205 1667457 I don't know<br />what you're talking about, pal.
1672692 1673892 What's the problem?
1673922 1675340 Says he wants to see the Penguin.
1675424 1677593 Penguin? There's no Penguin here.
1677676 1679303 That's what I tried to tell him.
1679386 1681680 Get out of here, freak. You hear me?
1681763 1683640 Or that little suit's<br />gonna get all full of blood.
1685017 1686217 Mine or yours?
1690939 1692941 [dance music continues on speakers]
1694255 1695455 [twin 1] Get him!
1695485 1696685 [woman] I saw that whole thing.
1696737 1697946 [twin 1] He's over there!
1698030 1699364 [woman] What is your problem?
1699656 1701408 [dance music continues on speakers]
1715589 1716789 [grunting]
1742032 1744201 Hey! Put the bat down,<br />or I'll blow your head off!
1747621 1749206 [people screaming]

1758548 1760342 You looking for me?

1763929 1767224 Boy, you're everything they say,<br />ain't ya?
1768100 1769601 I guess we both are.
1771645 1773063 How you doing?
1773689 1775107 I'm Oz.
1776525 1778151 [people cheering]
1780654 1781905 [Batman] Who is she?
1782364 1784074 [muffled club music playing]
1784950 1786868 I really don't know, chief.
1787577 1789788 I might have been coming out<br />at the same time,
1789871 1791248 but I wasn't rolling with them.
1791999 1793667 [footsteps approaching]
1804678 1805878 It's okay, baby.
1806221 1810017 Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.<br />Come on.
1835751 1836960 Thank you, honey.
1838045 1840172 - [music continues on speakers]<br />- [people cheering]
1843467 1845302 Here you go, champ.
1845385 1848930 I wanna know who she is,<br />and what she has to do with this murder.
1849014 1850807 - Whose murder?<br />- The mayor's.
1851308 1852684 Is that the mayor?
1852768 1854561 Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.
1855771 1857064 Don't make me hurt you.
1857147 1861318 You better watch it.<br />You know my reputation?
1861401 1864363 Yeah, I do. Do you?
1866114 1867616 Look...
1868867 1871661 I'm just the proprietor, okay?
1872496 1876792 I mean, what people do here<br />ain't got nothing to do with me.
1885133 1886718 Tell you one thing.
1888887 1892474 Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.
1892974 1895477 Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?<br />Maybe she knows.
1898730 1900565 What? Too soon?
1907614 1909282 [soft suspenseful music plays]
1910409 1912786 You let me know<br />if there's anything else I can do.
1914037 1915956 - [train wheels squealing]<br />- [sirens wailing nearby]

1946716 1947916 [indistinct talking on phone]
1947946 1949281 Baby, what's wrong?
1949948 1951950 Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />Slow down, slow down. I can't...
1954411 1955829 On the news?
1956496 1959791 Okay. No. No, stay there.<br />Wait for me, okay?
1959875 1961585 Wait for me, I'm on my way home.
1961615 1962722 [woman on phone crying]
1962752 1966381 Listen, baby, we're gonna get<br />the hell out of here, okay? I promise.
1967090 1969718 If we have to leave earlier,<br />we'll leave tonight.
1970635 1971835 - [line disconnects abruptly]<br />- Uh...

2214462 2215755 [panting]
2215839 2217924 He hurt her? That's why you killed him?
2218007 2220760 What? Oh, please.<br />Just give me the goddamn...

2258840 2261468 Listen, honey,<br />you got the wrong idea, okay?
2261551 2264012 I didn't kill anybody.<br />I'm here for my friend.
2264095 2265472 She's trying to<br />get the hell out of here,
2265555 2267307 and this son of a bitch<br />stole her passport.
2267390 2268767 What does she know?
2268850 2270977 Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked<br />she won't even tell me.
2271060 2272645 She did seem upset.
2274439 2275940 Back at your place.
2277984 2279486 Let's go talk to her.
2285074 2287076 [engines roaring]
2299047 2301382 [muffled TV chatter]
2305678 2306878 Anni!

2310725 2311925 Anni!
2315855 2317106 Anni!
2319567 2320944 [weatherwoman]<br />It's gonna be cool this evening.
2321027 2323238 It's gonna be down into the 40s.
2323780 2325198 [newscaster]<br />More breaking news this hour
2325281 2330662 as the city is rocked by a second<br />high-profile murder in as many nights.
2330745 2333039 And this time, the killer has<br />come forward to claim credit online...
2333122 2335959 Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?<br />She's just a kid.
2336606 2337806 [sighs]
2337836 2339587 Shit, they took my phone.
2339671 2341047 [newscaster 2] His victim, longtime head<br />of the Gotham City PD,
2341130 2342549 Commissioner Pete Savage,
2342632 2344759 was found dead earlier tonight
2344843 2348054 inside the Police Athletic League<br />facilities in the Tricorner area.
2348137 2351474 The killer posted the following message<br />on social media,
2351558 2354435 and we have to warn you,<br />the video is very disturbing.
2358022 2359315 [deep and heavy breathing on TV]
2359524 2362235 [distorted male voice]<br />Hello, people of Gotham.
2362318 2364279 This is the Riddler speaking.
2365780 2367407 On Halloween night,
2367490 2372287 I killed your mayor because he was not<br />who he pretended to be.
2372370 2374414 But I am not done.
2376082 2377500 [muffled whimpering on TV]
2377584 2379752 Here is another...
2380503 2382088 [whimpering]
2382547 2383882 [rattling]
2384257 2387051 Who will soon be losing face.
2387135 2388335 [Pete whimpers]
2388386 2392599 I will kill again, and again, and again,
2392682 2394517 until our day of judgment
2394601 2399606 when the truth about our city<br />[raises voice] will finally...
2400398 2402400 [in normal tone] be unmasked.
2403985 2405737 Goodbye!
2406321 2408031 [Pete panting and whimpering]
2409991 2411618 [newscaster] Commissioner Savage<br />served a distinguished
2411701 2413828 30-year career on the GCPD...
2413912 2416122 Holy shit, I seen that guy too.
2417498 2418698 At the club.
2420168 2421586 The Iceberg Lounge?
2422337 2423796 44 Below.
2425715 2426915 What is that?
2429969 2431512 The club within the club.
2432597 2434515 [scoffs] The real club.
2436809 2438561 It's a mob hangout.
2439020 2440438 Is that where you work?
2440563 2441763 [cat meows]
2442357 2443557 Selina?
2449072 2450949 No, I just work the bar upstairs.
2454410 2455954 But I see 'em come in.
2456037 2457246 Who?
2457830 2460249 A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,<br />I can tell you that.
2461834 2464504 Your basic upstanding citizen types.
2466756 2468299 You're gonna help me on this.
2468925 2470426 For your friend.
2472095 2473721 [cat meowing]
2481020 2482355 You got a lot of cats.
2483856 2485775 I have a thing about strays.
2486317 2488194 [gentle music playing]
2489904 2491239 You're not safe here.
2492365 2493565 I can take care of myself.
2493616 2496411 [newscaster] Two public figures now dead<br />in just the last two nights,
2496494 2498037 and only days before the election.
2498121 2501374 Police and city officials<br />are left searching for a killer
2501457 2504293 and hoping to find him<br />before he kills again.
2522311 2525481 He waited for him at the gym.
2526607 2528651 Pete always liked to work out<br />late at night,
2528735 2530862 when no one else was around.
2531988 2533406 There's a needle mark on his neck.
2533489 2535450 Injected him with arsenic.
2537452 2538786 Rat poison.
2539579 2541164 Yeah.
2541330 2543791 That seems to be his theme here.
2544333 2545710 Look at this thing.
2545793 2547295 [eerie music playing]
2553843 2555595 It's a maze.
2555762 2556962 [flashlight clicks]
2558181 2561476 What kind of demented son of a bitch<br />does this to a person?
2564228 2565428 [Batman] More symbols.
2567815 2569400 It's another cipher.
2569484 2572236 He blasted these out<br />after his message went viral.
2572904 2575490 Bastard murders you and your reputation.
2575573 2578701 That guy pushes drops. On the east end.
2580286 2581621 I don't get it.
2581704 2584082 Why would Pete get involved<br />in something like this?
2584999 2587001 Looks like he got greedy.
2587031 2588181 You kidding me?
2588211 2590922 After everything we did<br />to take down the Maronis?
2591005 2594258 We busted their entire operation,<br />then he caves to some lowlife dealer?
2594342 2596552 Maybe he's not who you thought.
2598096 2600139 You make it sound like he had it coming.
2602391 2603851 He was a cop.
2605186 2606479 Crossed a line.
2625957 2627157 [flashlight clicks off]
2629335 2630837 [eerie music continues]
2637718 2639387 "I'm mad about you.
2639470 2643141 Want to know my name?<br />Just look inside and see."
2650273 2653359 "Follow the maze until you find the rat.
2653526 2657113 Bring him into the light,<br />and you'll find where I'm at."
2657196 2658906 The hell is that?
2659657 2662827 "Bring him into the light"?<br />"Find the rat"?
2663953 2665454 I don't know.
2666330 2667530 [Martinez] Lieutenant.
2667582 2669000 They're coming back.
2669083 2670334 [Gordon] We got to get out of here.
2671085 2672461 [eerie music continues]
2674422 2675631 Come on.
2680720 2681920 [Selina] Ow!
2683222 2684557 I don't know about these things.
2684640 2688102 I need to see in there,<br />this hunting ground.
2692106 2694692 Hey, why am I starting to feel<br />like a fish on a hook?
2696569 2698029 I'm just looking for Annika.
2702325 2703951 Boy, you're a real sweetheart.
2705077 2707705 You really don't care what happens to me<br />in there tonight, do you?
2708456 2710166 [gentle music playing]
2717256 2718466 Look at me.
2728100 2730269 Looks good. Here.
2736317 2737517 [sighs]

2773437 2775439 I got you. Can you hear me?
2776399 2777599 Yeah.
2786075 2787275 Hey, where you goin'?
2787702 2788902 Hospitality.
2789578 2792415 [Batman] That's one of the guys<br />I got into it with the other night.
2794208 2795710 Looks like I broke his nose.
2795918 2797461 [door slides open]
2800548 2801748 [computer trilling]
2802383 2804468 "Kenzie, William."
2804552 2806012 He's an off-duty cop.
2807888 2809557 Are you sure no one can see<br />these things in my eyes?
2809890 2811934 Don't worry. I'm watching you.
2812935 2814135 [sighs]
2815354 2818149 - [techno music playing]<br />- [indistinct chatter]
2825614 2826814 [computer trilling rhythmically]
2828492 2831620 Don't look away.<br />I need time to make IDs.
2831704 2832904 Great.
2840087 2842381 These guys have a little problem<br />with eye contact, don't they?
2842465 2844050 Feels good, doesn't it?
2844133 2846344 [man] Yeah, baby. Feels real good.
2852391 2854018 [Selina] Jesus, I hate dropheads.
2854048 2855197 [Batman] Really?
2855227 2856240 "Cause when I first saw you,
2856270 2857480 it looked like you were<br />dealing for Penguin.
2857563 2859815 You don't know<br />what you're talking about. Can we not...
2860441 2862193 Can we not do this right now?
2864111 2865654 Wait. Who was that?
2865738 2866938 Oh, I saw him.
2866968 2868127 [Batman] Look back.
2868157 2869950 If I look back, it's gonna be<br />a whole can of worms.
2870034 2871369 I need to see his face.
2873037 2874497 [sighs] Jesus.
2882505 2883705 That's the DA.
2883735 2884852 Gil Colson.
2884882 2886550 And he's coming over. You happy?
2886634 2887843 [Batman] Talk to him.
2890909 2892109 Hey. How you doing?
2892139 2893277 Hi.
2893307 2894507 I'm Gil.
2895351 2896977 Hey, aren't you the DA?
2897007 2898199 Yeah.
2898229 2900398 Wow. [chuckles] I've seen you on TV.
2900481 2901857 Is that right?
2902274 2904485 I haven't seen you around here before.
2905486 2907530 It's a hell of a time<br />to be the new girl,
2907613 2910157 'cause people are all a little on edge.
2910241 2911742 [Selina] Oh, honey, I live on the edge.
2911826 2913026 - [Gil] Is that right?<br />- [Selina chuckles]
2913119 2914328 [Gil chuckles] I like that.
2914600 2915800 Do you want to come over?
2915830 2917030 Sure.
2919959 2921293 - [Gil] This is Travis.<br />- Hey.
2921377 2922795 [Gil] You wanna take a seat over there?
2923087 2924964 - Richie, Glen.<br />- [Richie] Hey.
2926424 2927925 That's half the DA's office.
2928008 2929208 [Gil] You know Carla here, huh?
2929238 2930272 Hi.
2930302 2932346 That's Cheri. Don't mind her,<br />she's just taking a break.
2932430 2934306 Drowning our sorrows.
2934640 2935933 You want a drop?
2936016 2938060 [Selina] Uh, no, I'm good.<br />But you enjoy.
2938352 2939770 [music continues on speakers]
2940020 2941689 Hope you don't mind.
2941772 2943816 I got a lot on my shoulders<br />with that psycho running around.
2944087 2945287 He's wasted.
2945317 2946517 No shit.
2948028 2949228 [chuckles] I like this girl.
2949488 2951073 Oh, hey, I like you too!
2954618 2957955 I mean, this Riddler, he's going after<br />the most powerful people in the city.
2957985 2959176 He knows so much.
2959206 2960499 [Travis] He doesn't know shit, man.
2960583 2962835 [Gil] What are you talking about?<br />Yeah, he does! What about that rat...
2962865 2963889 [Richie] Hey, hey, Gil, come on.
2963919 2965838 - Think maybe you had a little too much.<br />- Hey. The rat.
2965921 2967882 - [Richie] Slow down.<br />- Ask him about the rat.
2969884 2971719 [Selina] Hey, what's this about a rat?
2975014 2976599 [inhales deeply]
2982062 2983272 I mean...
2984106 2987693 there was a rat. We had an informant.
2988277 2990696 We had big-time information<br />on Salvatore Maroni.
2990779 2992490 That's how we got him out of<br />the drops business.
2992573 2994158 He's talking about the Maroni case.
2994241 2997536 But if this guy knows,<br />it's gonna come out.
2998120 3000414 And when it does,<br />this whole city's gonna come apart.
3000498 3002416 Okay, I don't wanna hear this.
3002500 3005127 This is the kind of pillow talk<br />that got that Russian girl disappeared.
3005211 3006462 What do you know about that?
3008088 3009288 Does anybody want a drink?
3009318 3010436 [Gil] I want a drink.
3010466 3011717 Keep him talking.
3014741 3015941 Wait, where are you going?
3015971 3017067 She knows Annika.
3017097 3018516 No, stay on the DA.
3018599 3020518 I told you I'm looking for my friend.
3022645 3024772 - Where's Annika?<br />- Out of my face. I don't know you.
3024802 3025951 Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?
3025981 3028526 - What have you heard? Is she okay?<br />- Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.
3028609 3029860 What, you got a death wish?
3029944 3032404 [man] Hey, what's the problem, ladies?
3032488 3035407 [Carla]<br />There's no problem. It's just girl talk.
3035491 3036992 Let's keep it festive down here,<br />all right?
3037076 3038276 [Carla] Sure thing, Oz.
3042915 3044115 Hey.
3044542 3045742 Hey.
3046794 3049964 Been a long time<br />since I seen you down here.
3051257 3052466 How you been?
3054802 3056512 Yeah, I've been okay.
3057846 3059223 I was just...
3061267 3063102 I was just headed back upstairs.
3063852 3065052 Well...
3065938 3067606 don't be a stranger.
3081704 3084081 - You know Carmine Falcone.<br />- I told you it's a mob spot.
3084164 3085749 You didn't tell me<br />you had a relationship with him.
3085833 3087626 I don't have<br />a relationship with him, okay?
3087710 3089545 - Well, that's not what it looked like.<br />- Forget it.
3089575 3090766 Wait, what are you doing?
3090796 3093215 - Listen, I can't do this anymore.<br />- No! No!
3093340 3094883 [line breaking up]
3095301 3096501 [static buzzes, stream stops]
3097803 3099003 [Selina] Taxi!
3099054 3100556 [heavy breathing]
3102766 3103966 [Gil] Hey!
3105415 3106615 I lost you in there.
3106645 3107845 Yeah, I gotta go.
3108606 3110024 Oh, you need a ride?
3110733 3112026 That's me right there.
3112318 3114278 [eerie music playing]
3118053 3119253 Taxi!
3119283 3120483 I'm good.
3122119 3123537 I hope, uh...
3128125 3129543 I'll see you around.
3129627 3130827 [car door closes]
3133505 3135382 [eerie music continues]
3144433 3146101 [car alarm chirps]
3163952 3165996 [glass squeaking]
3168082 3170250 [eerie music continues]
3179802 3181261 [breathes deeply]
3181595 3183055 [Gil grunts]
3183138 3184890 [train rumbles past]
3187685 3189770 [car horn blaring continuously]
3196026 3197226 [car horn stops]
3200489 3202324 [Gil grunting weakly]
3213585 3215671 - [Gil grunts]<br />- [Riddler shushes]
3216213 3220008 Just hold still.
3220843 3222678 - [beeping]<br />- [Gil whimpers]
3225097 3227349 [Riddler breathing heavily and raspily]
3228183 3230436 [eerie music continues]
3239069 3240404 [wistful music playing]
3275355 3276555 [switch clicks]
3278129 3279329 [Batman] What do you know about
3279359 3281653 a confidential informant<br />in the Maroni case?
3284740 3286450 Yeah, sure, there was.
3287159 3288994 That's the rat we're looking for.
3289912 3291789 Somehow Riddler knows who he is.
3292372 3295375 If we find the rat,<br />maybe it'll lead us to him.
3295459 3296919 Where are you getting this?
3297002 3299880 I have a source<br />who spoke to the DA tonight.
3300672 3302132 Gil's very nervous.
3303091 3305636 I think the killer's targeting<br />people close to that case.
3305719 3307596 I worked that case.
3307679 3309640 Riddler's not after you.
3309723 3310923 How do you know?
3311016 3312434 You're not corrupt.
3313477 3315020 Colson's dirty?
3320901 3322402 Maybe I, uh...
3323070 3326406 I go after him.<br />Lean on him to give up the rat.
3326490 3329785 It's too dangerous.<br />They made a secret deal with this guy.
3330536 3332329 Who knows how many people it touches.
3332412 3335624 Politicians. Police. The courts.
3336917 3338627 It could tear the whole city apart.
3339044 3341088 [Gordon] Jesus, this is a powder keg.
3342714 3344466 [Batman] And Riddler's the match.
3345342 3346542 [Batman on video]<br />You know Carmine Falcone.
3346593 3347886 [Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.
3347970 3349388 [Batman] You didn't tell me you had<br />a relationship with him.
3349471 3350973 [Selina] I don't have a relationship...
3351003 3351985 [video rewinds]
3352015 3353600 [Batman] You didn't tell me you had<br />a relationship with him.
3353684 3355352 [Selina] I don't have<br />a relationship with him. Okay?
3355382 3356448 [video rewinds]
3356478 3357938 [Batman] You know Carmine Falcone.
3357968 3359117 [Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.
3359147 3360774 [Batman] You didn't tell me<br />you had a relationship with him.
3360858 3362693 [Selina] I don't have<br />a relationship with him. Okay?
3362776 3364027 - [Alfred] Pretty.<br />- [tape clicks off]
3366029 3367406 She a new friend of yours?
3371994 3373203 I'm not so sure.
3374037 3375539 Looks like you upset her.
3376707 3378834 Shall I take this as a good sign?
3378864 3379972 What?
3380002 3380973 Your attire.
3381003 3383130 Is Bruce Wayne making<br />an actual appearance?
3383213 3385215 There's a public memorial<br />for Mayor Mitchell.
3385299 3387968 Serial killers like to<br />follow reactions to their crimes.
3389011 3390596 Riddler might not be able to resist.
3390679 3392139 Oh, that reminds me.
3393307 3397269 I've taken the liberty of doing<br />a little work on this latest cipher.
3397811 3399313 The one from the rat maze.
3399730 3402816 I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,
3403150 3405027 but I'm fairly certain<br />this translates to,
3405110 3408363 "You are El Rata Alada."
3408989 3410407 [Bruce] Rata Alada?
3410490 3411700 "Rat with wings"?
3411783 3414286 It's slang for "pigeon."<br />Does that mean anything to you?
3414369 3415621 Yeah.
3417080 3418280 A stool pigeon.
3418457 3420083 Where are your cufflinks?
3420167 3421367 I couldn't find them.
3422586 3424546 Well, you can't go out like that.
3424630 3426423 Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.
3430594 3433388 You have to keep up appearances.<br />You're still a Wayne.
3433472 3434672 [scoffs]
3435098 3437309 And what about you? Are you a Wayne?
3438310 3440103 Your father gave them to me.
3442940 3444608 [gentle music playing]
3445859 3448987 [protesters chanting]<br />No more lies! No more lies!
3467172 3470133 Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,<br />you're going straight down there.
3474137 3475430 [melancholy music playing]
3476431 3478558 [protesters continue chanting]
3482688 3484439 [reporter] Is that Bruce Wayne?
3484523 3487150 [reporters] Mr. Wayne!<br />Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!
3487442 3490904 - [reporters clamoring]<br />- [camera shutters clicking]
3496243 3497443 [man] Hold it.
3498578 3499830 You good, fellas?
3500414 3501614 Good.
3503542 3504742 We're good, Mr. Falcone.
3505168 3507212 [melancholy music continues]
3522436 3523636 Sir?
3523770 3525313 [reporters continue clamoring]
3542936 3544136 [bodyguard] Hey!
3544166 3546168 Give us a wide berth here,<br />would you, slick?
3547127 3548962 Hey, watch it, fellas.
3549421 3551715 You got the prince of the city there.
3554551 3556386 Some event, huh?
3556470 3559431 Brought out the one guy in the city<br />more reclusive than me.
3559514 3561975 Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.
3562059 3563685 Aren't you afraid<br />someone'll take a shot at you?
3563769 3565771 Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?
3566646 3568065 Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?
3568690 3570150 Wow. Is that right?
3570233 3572277 His father saved my life.
3573236 3576448 I got shot in the chest. Right here.
3577657 3581161 I couldn't go to no hospital,<br />so we showed up on his doorstep.
3581453 3584664 Operated right on the dining room table.
3584748 3590003 Kid here, he saw the whole thing,<br />up on the stairs looking down.
3591421 3593423 I remember your face.
3595425 3597385 You don't think that meant something,<br />he did that?
3597761 3599888 It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.
3601223 3602808 "Hippocratic oath."
3605352 3606561 That's good.
3607104 3608304 Excuse me.
3609314 3610816 [laughs]
3611858 3613058 Yes.
3613235 3615570 ["Ave Maria" playing]
3617447 3619282 [indistinct radio chatter]
3621326 3623995 - [heavy breathing]<br />- [man coughing]
3626811 3628011 [announcer on mic] Ladies and gentlemen,
3628041 3629626 thank you all for<br />coming to today's memorial
3629709 3632087 for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.
3632170 3633964 Our program will begin shortly.
3634047 3635465 As a reminder, the family asked that
3635549 3636967 those wishing to honor<br />the mayor's memory
3637050 3638468 consider a donation to
3638552 3640595 - the cause most dear to his heart...<br />- [scuffling]
3640679 3642931 ...the Gotham Renewal Fund,
3643014 3644224 our city's safety net.
3644599 3647144 What good's a safety net<br />doesn't catch anybody?
3648228 3651982 Didn't help my daughter<br />when she needed it, I can tell you that.
3652065 3655277 The guy was just another<br />rich scum-sucker.
3656278 3658155 He got what he deserved.
3660073 3661273 Know what I mean?
3662367 3664494 Hey, don't I know you?
3664578 3665778 [woman] Bruce Wayne.
3666580 3668540 Why haven't you called me back?
3668623 3669823 I'm sorry?
3669916 3672252 I'm Bella Real. I'm running for mayor.
3672335 3673545 I wouldn't be bothering you here,
3673628 3676298 but your people keep telling me<br />you're unavailable.
3676381 3677716 Will you walk with me?
3679801 3681511 ["Ave Maria" continues playing]
3682888 3684222 Mr. Wayne.
3684306 3685515 Mr. Wayne.
3686224 3689311 You know, you really could be<br />doing more for this city.
3689895 3691730 Your family has<br />a history of philanthropy,
3691813 3694232 but as far as I can tell,<br />you're not doing anything.
3694316 3696776 If I'm elected, I want to change that.
3697360 3698653 Thank you.
3699529 3700729 [Bella] My God.
3702365 3704868 I'm gonna go pay my respects.<br />Will you wait for me?
3704951 3706578 I want to continue this.
3710790 3711990 Excuse me.
3713710 3715587 I'm so sorry for your loss.
3717568 3718768 Thank you.
3718798 3720550 [Gordon] Excuse me, chief.<br />Can I talk to you?
3721885 3723762 Gil Colson is missing.
3723845 3725138 [Mackenzie] What?
3725222 3727515 He hasn't been heard from<br />since last night.
3727545 3728695 Christ, not again.
3728725 3730810 Hey. Mr. Wayne.
3733104 3735148 You got people looking for him, Jim?
3735815 3738109 [Gordon] Sent a couple guys<br />to his house. Nothing.
3738139 3739164 [Mackenzie] What'd his wife say?
3739194 3740403 [Gordon] She hadn't heard from him.
3742364 3743782 [people outside screaming]
3744532 3745742 [indistinct shouting]
3747953 3749621 [tires squeal]

3780235 3781987 [menacing music playing]
3795166 3796366 [Gordon] Get out of the car!
3796835 3799045 Get out of the car and show your hands!
3800463 3801673 Get out!
3810807 3812100 [man in car grunting]

3819774 3821359 Christ, it's Colson.
3821443 3823153 [officer]<br />There's a bomb around his neck!
3826281 3828325 - [cell phone ringing]<br />- [people gasp]
3828908 3830327 [whimpering]
3831119 3832412 [cell phone continues ringing]
3838209 3839753 Let's clear this place out now!
3839836 3841463 [officer 2]<br />We've got to get this place cleared out!
3841921 3843381 [people clamoring]
3843798 3845300 [cell phone continues ringing]
3855185 3856394 [cell phone ringing]
3856478 3857896 [whirring]
3871910 3873828 - [ringing continues]<br />- [camera shutter clicks]
3875705 3878458 [man] Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.
3878750 3880752 [sirens wailing]
3881461 3882879 [officer]<br />We don't know if he's in on it.
3886007 3887342 What's he looking at?
3887717 3889552 [cell phone ringing]
3891012 3892889 [distant footsteps]
3896142 3898561 [footsteps coming closer]
3898895 3901106 [ominous music playing]
3906111 3907445 Holy shit.
3908488 3910156 [Mackenzie] Are you kidding me?
3910240 3912992 What the hell is he doing? Gordon!
3913827 3916287 Your guy's gonna<br />get himself killed in there.
3917247 3919207 [cell phone continues ringing]
3932053 3933263 Please.
3933430 3936182 He made me do it.<br />[tearfully] I'm so sorry.
3936599 3938810 He told me if I didn't do exactly<br />what he said, he'd kill me.
3938893 3940093 I'm so sorry.
3940395 3942063 Looks like a combination lock.
3942147 3943606 Can't we just cut it off?
3944357 3946025 Not if you want to keep your head.
3949821 3951239 [cell phone continues ringing]
3976473 3978349 [Riddler breathing heavily]
3982729 3983980 [Riddler] You came.
3985815 3987015 Who are you?
3987442 3988642 Me?
3990862 3992447 I'm nobody.
3993907 3996326 I'm just an instrument,
3996409 4000705 here to unmask the truth<br />about this cesspool we call a city.
4001185 4002385 "Unmask"?
4002415 4003615 Yes.
4004417 4007253 Let's do it together, okay?
4007337 4009756 I've been trying to reach you.
4010423 4012759 You're part of this too.
4012842 4014636 How am I a part of this?
4014719 4016638 You'll see.
4016721 4018473 [officer] Hey, Chief.<br />You better take a look at this.
4018556 4020642 [Riddler on stream]<br />Say hello to my followers.
4020725 4021976 We're live.
4022060 4025063 They're here to watch our little trial.
4026272 4027472 Al the moment,
4027524 4030902 the man across from you, Mr. Colson,
4030932 4032081 is dead.
4032111 4034113 Jesus, can we get somebody out here?<br />This psycho's gonna kill me!
4034143 4035210 But wait a minute...
4035240 4038368 [shouting] Shut up! You deserve<br />to be dead after what you did!
4038451 4041454 You hear me?
4041538 4042738 [softly] Okay.
4043081 4044707 [Riddler groaning comically]
4047168 4048753 [Riddler laughing]
4051297 4053383 [Riddler] I'm giving you a chance.
4055134 4057303 No one ever gave me a chance.
4059347 4060547 Now,
4061391 4064185 ever since I was a child,
4064269 4067855 I've always loved little puzzles.
4068439 4070858 For me, they are a retreat
4070942 4074279 from the horrors of our world.
4074362 4079576 Maybe they can bring<br />some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.
4079659 4081911 - You want me to do puzzles?<br />- [chuckles excitedly]
4081995 4084747 Three riddles in two minutes.
4084831 4088918 You give me the answers,<br />and I'll give you the code for the lock.
4089002 4091337 - Do you understand?<br />- Yeah.
4091421 4093590 Okay, okay. So I just...
4093652 4094852 - You want me to...<br />- [device beeps]
4094882 4097218 - [whimpers]<br />- Riddle number one...
4097302 4100930 - [timer beeping]<br />- "It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,
4101014 4105685 but when it's denied,<br />it's violence you may find."
4105768 4108187 Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?
4108217 4109409 "Cruel"? "Poetic"?
4109439 4110857 - "Justice."<br />- Huh?
4110887 4112036 The answer's "justice."
4112066 4113276 - Justice?<br />- Yes!
4113359 4114944 - Oh, God.<br />- Justice!
4115028 4119365 [dramatically] And you were supposed<br />to be an arm of justice in this city,
4119449 4121826 along with the late mayor<br />and police commissioner,
4121909 4124287 were you not, Mr. Colson?
4124370 4125580 Of course, of course. Of course.
4125663 4128041 Riddle number two.
4128124 4132253 "If you are justice, please do not lie.
4132337 4136507 What is the price for your blind eye?"
4136591 4138384 - "The price"?<br />- [Batman] "Bribes."
4138468 4139719 Oh, God. "Bribes"?
4139802 4141971 He's asking you how much it cost<br />for you to turn your back.
4142055 4143306 [hesitating]
4143369 4144569 [shouting] Fifty-eight seconds!
4144599 4145850 - How much?<br />- Nothing!
4145933 4148144 - [raises voice] How much?<br />- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.
4148227 4150521 I get a monthly payment<br />just not to prosecute certain cases.
4150551 4151492 What cases?
4151522 4152702 He didn't ask me that!
4152732 4153932 - Come on! Ten grand.<br />- [Riddler laughing]
4154192 4157153 - That's my answer. It's ten grand!<br />- Okay. Okay. Okay.
4157236 4159864 Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.
4159947 4163785 Just one more to go<br />before your time runs out.
4163868 4166287 [singsongy] Last riddle.
4166371 4170708 [dramatically]<br />"Since your justice is so select,
4170792 4175088 please tell us which vermin<br />you're paid to protect."
4175171 4177256 - "Which vermin"?<br />- [Batman] The rat.
4177340 4179884 The informant you all protect<br />from the Salvatore Maroni case.
4179967 4181761 - How do you know about that?<br />- What's his name?
4181844 4183054 Twenty seconds.
4183137 4184806 - No.<br />- He's gonna kill you.
4184889 4186849 I'm a dead man either way.<br />You're talking to a dead man, okay?
4186933 4188476 If 1 go out this way, it's just me.
4188559 4191688 But if I give over that name,<br />I have family, people I love.
4191771 4193231 - He'll kill them too.<br />- Who will?
4193314 4194649 - People are watching.<br />- What people?
4194732 4196859 It's so much bigger<br />than you could ever imagine.
4196943 4199112 - It's the whole system!<br />- Five!
4199142 4200124 - Four!<br />- [beeping rapidly]
4200154 4201531 - Oh, God, have mercy on me...<br />- Three!
4201614 4203491 - Goodbye!<br />- [device trills]
4203700 4204900 [Batman grunts]
4206869 4208830 [people gasp]
4210248 4211999 [ears ringing]
4213626 4215211 [muffled, indistinct shouting]
4226681 4228558 [ringing intensifies]
4230768 4231968 [ringing stops]
4233688 4235064 [Martinez]<br />Who do you think he is under there?
4235094 4236035 [Gordon] Take it easy.
4236065 4237265 [Martinez] I want to see.
4238401 4239610 [medic] What is that thing? Leather?
4243364 4244824 [medic 2] What's he got on his eyes?
4244907 4246367 [Martinez] Who cares?<br />I want to see his face.
4246451 4247660 What are we doing here?<br />Let's just take it off...
4247744 4248944 - [Gordon] Hey!<br />- [officers clamoring]
4249495 4252623 Hey! Hey! Hey!
4252707 4254375 Relax, God damn it!
4254459 4255960 You're protecting this guy, Jim?
4257378 4259922 He interfered in<br />an active hostage situation.
4260006 4262425 Colson's blood is on his hands.
4262508 4263926 Maybe it's on yours.
4265282 4266482 What'd you say?
4266512 4268097 He would rather die than talk.
4268681 4270183 What was he afraid of?
4270933 4272133 You?
4272310 4273519 [menacing music playing]
4279150 4280568 You son of a bitch.
4281152 4284155 You have any idea<br />what kind of trouble you're in?
4284238 4285948 You could be an accessory to murder.
4285978 4287128 [officer] Why are we playing games...
4287158 4288826 [officers clamoring]
4288889 4290089 [Officer 2] Get him! Come on!
4290119 4292121 Back off! Back off!
4292205 4294499 Great, now I got you<br />on assaulting an officer!
4294582 4296667 - You got me on assaulting three.<br />- Hey!
4296751 4299545 What's the matter with you?<br />This isn't the way to do this!
4299921 4301672 [breathing heavily]
4302215 4303758 You too now?
4303841 4306385 Let me handle this, Chief.<br />Just give me a minute.
4306469 4309055 You're gonna put yourself on the line<br />for this scumbag, Jim?
4309138 4311390 Just give me a minute.<br />I'll get him to cooperate.
4314185 4315686 Okay, give him the room.
4331327 4332620 Two minutes.
4344382 4345967 You listen to me.
4347552 4349554 [softly] We gotta get you out of here.
4351222 4353182 That would put a lot of heat on you.
4353266 4354934 Well, you punched me in the face.
4355956 4357156 [Batman scoffs]
4357186 4358479 Take this key.
4359772 4363150 Through that door. Hallway to the stairs<br />that go to the roof.
4364193 4365903 [Kenzie] Hey, what the hell<br />is going on here?
4366904 4369198 Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?
4369615 4371868 [suspenseful music playing]
4372577 4374954 Who's the mustache with the broken nose?
4378374 4381085 That's Kenzie. Narcotics.
4381168 4384088 He's one of the guys I got into it with<br />at the Iceberg Lounge.
4385006 4387633 What are you saying?<br />Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?
4390344 4392305 Or he moonlights as a cop.
4396893 4398394 - [officer] Jesus Christ!<br />- [Kenzie] Go!
4398477 4399979 [officer 2] Somebody stop him!
4400563 4402440 [officers clamoring]
4404066 4405401 [tense music playing]
4427173 4428549 [gasping]
4430426 4431802 [grunts]
4438184 4439727 - [officer 1] There he is!<br />- [officer 2] Freeze!
4442396 4444315 [heroic music playing]
4459038 4460238 [grunting]
4464710 4466212 [groaning]
4486107 4488025 [Gordon] Could have at least<br />pulled that punch, man.
4488567 4489777 I did.
4489860 4493239 Bock put out an APB on you.<br />You really think he's in on this?
4493322 4495366 I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?
4495429 4496629 I only trust you.
4496659 4498995 What's a narcotics cop doing<br />with Falcone's right-hand man?
4499078 4502456 Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."<br />Maybe Kenzie's part of it.
4503187 4504387 You think Penguin's the rat?
4504417 4507461 His club caters to the mob.<br />Maroni practically lived there.
4507545 4509505 Penguin would have been<br />privy to a lot of dirt.
4509588 4510923 DA was a regular too.
4511007 4514510 Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam<br />and working a deal was his only way out.
4515594 4516804 The Rata Alada.
4516834 4517900 The what?
4517930 4519390 Riddler's latest.
4519473 4521183 The cipher in the maze.
4521267 4523769 It means "a rat with wings."<br />Like a stool pigeon.
4525354 4526981 A penguin's got wings too.
4528983 4530943 Time for me<br />to have another conversation with him.
4531027 4532695 What about the Riddler?<br />He's gonna kill again.
4532778 4535990 It's all connected.<br />Like it or not, it's his game now.
4536073 4539243 You want to find Riddler,<br />we gotta find that rat.
4539493 4540995 [thunder rumbling]
4541871 4543706 [Gordon on radio]<br />Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.
4544812 4546012 [Batman] There's Penguin.
4546042 4547918 [Gordon] I wonder what's in the bags.
4549545 4550796 You want to move in?
4552673 4554133 [Batman] Let's follow.
4554800 4557053 [suspenseful music playing]
4562224 4563434 [car horn honking]
4572651 4576197 They stopped at Waterfront Street.<br />The recycling plant.
4576322 4577573 [Batman] I'm here.
4578991 4580659 - [Penguin] How you doing?<br />- [man] Yeah, good. How are you?
4580743 4583245 [Penguin] Good, good.<br />Let's get in out of this deluge.
4584705 4586749 [conversation continues indistinctly]
4588584 4590336 [suspenseful music continues]
4602473 4605017 It's a drug lab. Drops.
4605101 4606310 This is a buy.
4606393 4609563 Looks like they got Maroni's operation<br />up and running again.
4609647 4610847 Or they never shut it down at all.
4610877 4611827 [Gordon] What are you saying?
4611857 4614985 The biggest drug bust in GCPD history<br />was a fraud?
4615277 4616946 [motorcycle approaching]
4617696 4619698 [suspenseful music continues]
4639343 4640761 This just got complicated.
4641512 4642712 What do you mean?
4646851 4648227 [twin 1 grunts]
4648602 4650062 Hey! What happened?
4650146 4651480 You all right?
4653482 4654682 [grunts]
4662199 4663993 Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.
4664118 4665744 [sighs] Jesus.
4666495 4668330 Is this how you get your kicks, hon?
4668831 4670166 Sneaking up on girls in the dark?
4670249 4671959 Is that why you work in the club?
4672606 4673806 It was all just a score?
4673836 4677631 I would love to sit and go over<br />every gory detail with you, bat boy...
4679008 4680926 but, uh, those assholes are coming back.
4685931 4687308 - [gunfire]<br />- [gasps]

5103223 5106059 What the hell is this?<br />Good cop, batshit cop?
5106143 5108770 - Who's the Riddler?<br />- Riddler? How should I know?
5108854 5110147 [Gordon] Let's make it easy for you, Oz.
5110230 5111648 Cops caught you doing something.
5111732 5113358 They were gonna shut you down,<br />put you away.
5113442 5115319 So you gave up a bigger fish<br />to save your ass.
5115402 5117529 You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.
5117613 5118822 His drops operation.
5118905 5121366 But the cops, the city officials,<br />the mayor, the DA,
5121450 5125078 they got greedy, right?<br />Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.
5125162 5126913 They wanted to take over<br />the drops business too,
5126997 5129333 but they needed a minor league mope<br />like you to run it.
5129416 5132628 You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.<br />You work for them too.
5132711 5133911 What are you, crazy?
5133941 5135100 [Gordon] That why you killed the girl?
5135130 5136143 I didn't kill no girl!
5136173 5137966 We know she worked for you<br />at the 44 Below.
5138050 5139343 But she got too close, right?
5139426 5141637 Found out from Mitchell that you were<br />the rat, so you killed her.
5141720 5143680 But somehow Riddler found out too.
5143764 5145682 He knows so much about you.
5145766 5147809 - You must know about him.<br />- Who is he?
5148393 5150604 Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.
5151021 5152221 Why don't you start harmonizing?
5152522 5155192 There's only one problem<br />with your little scenario, okay?
5155275 5156610 I ain't no rat!
5156693 5158528 You got any idea what Carmine Falcone<br />would do to me
5158558 5159750 if he heard this kind of talk?
5159780 5161948 Oh, you don't wanna<br />talk about rats, huh?
5162032 5164576 Maybe we can talk about<br />what they did to my partner's face.
5164660 5166203 Holy God, what are you showing me here?
5166286 5167913 - This was around his head!<br />- Come on!
5167996 5169915 [yells] Open your eyes!
5173835 5175420 Are you El Rata Alada?
5175504 5177005 El Rata Alada?
5177089 5178924 Yeah, a "rat with wings."<br />A stool pigeon.
5179007 5181343 That's not you?<br />The symbols in the maze, right here.
5181426 5184012 It says you are El Rata Alada.
5184096 5185472 "You are El Rata"? It says that?
5185555 5186765 Why, you got something to tell us?
5186848 5188048 Yeah!
5188288 5189488 It's, like, the worst Spanish<br />I ever heard.
5189518 5190718 What?
5190769 5192104 It's "La."
5192187 5193480 "La" rata.
5193980 5195982 What, is this Riddler stupid<br />or something?
5196066 5197943 Jesus! Look at you two.
5198360 5200612 World's greatest detectives!
5201029 5203323 Am I the only here knows the difference<br />between "el" and "la"?
5203353 5204544 Jesus!
5204574 5206076 No habla espanol, fellas?
5206159 5208161 Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!
5209517 5210717 You think he made a mistake?
5210747 5211957 He doesn't make mistakes.
5211987 5213136 A rat with wings?
5213166 5214751 You know what that sounds like to me?
5214835 5218004 A friggin' bat! Huh?<br />You ever think of that?
5218088 5220090 "You are El Rata."
5225721 5229599 "You are el."
5238275 5239776 Maybe it was a mistake.
5239881 5241081 Maybe he isn't as smart as...
5241111 5242311 - [computer beeps]<br />- Wait.
5245365 5246700 Is that him?
5247576 5249411 - [beeps]<br />- Holy shit.
5250412 5251612 [typing]
5269306 5270891 What the hell does that mean?<br />Is he or isn't he?
5300295 5303924 "I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.
5304007 5306843 But in a mansion, in a slum,
5306927 5308845 I'll never know where I come from.
5309721 5311056 Do you know what I am?"
5311139 5312339 Any idea?
5312682 5313882 Yeah.
5315101 5316353 It's an orphan.
5325237 5326988 A mansion in a slum.
5328532 5331117 - He's talking about the old orphanage.<br />- The one that burned down?
5331201 5332911 It was part of the Wayne estate.
5333537 5335121 They donated it<br />after they built the tower.
5335205 5336405 Let's go.
5339292 5341753 You guys realize I'm still here, right?
5342796 5344172 You gonna untie me?
5344256 5345715 How the hell<br />am I supposed to get out of here?
5346174 5347384 [engine revs]

5446483 5448068 Thank you for coming today.
5449819 5451404 I believe in Gotham.
5452697 5454491 I believe in its promise.
5455700 5459162 But too many have been left behind<br />for too long,
5459704 5461498 and that's why I'm here today.
5461581 5464417 To announce,<br />not only my candidacy for mayor,
5464501 5467837 but also the creation<br />of the Gotham Renewal Fund.
5468380 5470256 Win or lose,
5470340 5473134 the Wayne Foundation pledges<br />a $1 billion donation
5473593 5476429 lo start a charitable endowment<br />for public works.
5477013 5481059 I want to bypass political gridlock,<br />and get money to people and projects
5481142 5483061 who need it now,
5483144 5484604 like these children behind me.
5484688 5486106 "Sins of the father."
5486189 5488650 Renewal is about growth.<br />It is about planting seeds...
5491111 5493196 ...and renewing Gotham's promise.
5493780 5495490 [applause]
5497075 5499285 Shall be visited upon the son.
5501287 5504416 Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

5574652 5576279 Something terrible is gonna happen!
5576946 5579032 I'm afraid it already has, sir.
5580575 5582202 ["Requiem: In Paradisum"<br />continues playing]
5590835 5592587 [voice quivering] About an hour ago.
5593755 5595423 I'm so sorry.
5596883 5598635 I've been trying to reach you.
5601387 5603056 [detective]<br />The package was intended for you.
5603598 5607352 It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.<br />We found this too.
5621825 5624160 [EKG machine beeping]
5630083 5631709 We've sedated him.
5631793 5633419 We just have to hope he stabilizes.
5634295 5637006 You should go home, Mr. Wayne.<br />Get some sleep.
5637549 5639300 Is there anyone else to notify?
5640635 5642053 Next of kin?
5647183 5648383 No.

5762006 5763206 Can you see me?
5766135 5768554 - Yeah, I can see you.<br />- Ineed to talk to you.
5769430 5770630 Where can we go?

5792203 5794664 - What?<br />- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.
5794747 5797208 Yeah, well, things were getting<br />a little hot for me, so...
5797875 5799627 How could they do that to her?
5799711 5801671 That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.
5801754 5803673 Her body was in his car.
5803756 5806634 I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna<br />make him pay. You gonna help me?
5806718 5809721 - Help you?<br />- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."
5809804 5811347 Your friend got involved<br />with the wrong people.
5811431 5813057 She didn't know any better.
5813141 5814475 Maybe you should have<br />explained it to her.
5814559 5816102 What the hell is that supposed to mean?
5816185 5817687 It means your choices have consequences.
5817770 5820148 Jesus Christ. "Choices"?
5820231 5822942 You know, whoever the hell you are,<br />you obviously grew up rich.
5823026 5824861 - Was it worth it?<br />- What?
5825194 5827363 Compromising yourself for money?
5828740 5830992 What did you have to do<br />to set up that score?
5832618 5836289 How close did you have to get<br />to Penguin? To Falcone?
5836372 5837707 You don't know<br />what the hell you're talking about.
5837790 5839125 Falcone owes me that money.
5839208 5840960 - He owes you?<br />- Yeah, and a lot more.
5840990 5841931 Oh, really? Why's that?
5841961 5842932 You know what? I can't even talk to you.
5842962 5844714 No! I want to know<br />why a guy like Falcone
5844744 5845852 would owe you anything.
5845882 5848217 [shouts] Because he's my father!
5857352 5860146 My mother worked at the 44 Below.
5861647 5862940 Just like Anni.
5865109 5867653 She used to take me there<br />when I was a little girl.
5869739 5871074 To the club?
5871991 5873191 Yeah.
5875703 5878581 I hid out in the dressing room<br />while she worked.
5879040 5880792 Used to see him there.
5881542 5883544 He scared the shit out of me.
5885505 5888966 And I could never understand<br />why he looked at me the way he did.
5889509 5893346 Then one night,<br />my mother told me who he was.
5896724 5899060 When I was seven,<br />my mother was murdered.
5899727 5901229 Strangled.
5901646 5905108 Never found out who.<br />Probably some creep from the club.
5906984 5909070 Anyway, social services<br />came to take me away,
5909153 5911322 and he didn't say a thing.
5913157 5914951 Couldn't even look at me.
5918704 5920456 He owes me that money.
5922250 5923668 I'm sorry.
5924794 5925994 For what I said.
5927338 5928756 Oh, it's all right.
5929465 5930665 [chuckles dryly]
5932301 5934387 You assume the worst in people.
5935304 5936681 Which, well...
5938975 5940893 maybe we're not so different after all.
5946357 5948109 Who are you under there?
5954198 5956075 What are you hiding?
5958453 5960288 Are you just...
5961873 5963583 hideously scarred?
5965710 5966910 Yeah.
5967670 5969005 [chuckles lightly]
5973968 5975386 Listen to me.
5976929 5979807 If we don't stand up for Annika,<br />no one will.
5980975 5985646 All anyone cares about in this place<br />are these white, privileged assholes.
5986272 5989358 The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.
5989442 5990693 Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.
5990776 5992028 I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
5992111 5994155 that psycho's right<br />to go after these creeps.
5994238 5995490 I think you'd be on his side.
5995573 5997200 What do you mean,<br />"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?
5997283 5999243 What, do you live in a cave?
5999327 6001412 The Riddler's latest.<br />It's all about the Waynes.
6002497 6006375 Listen, if I can find<br />that dickbag Kenzie,
6006459 6007668 will you help me?
6008920 6010213 Please.
6013007 6014926 Come on, Vengeance.
6017386 6019639 Just don't make any moves without me,<br />understand?
6019722 6021349 It's a little more dangerous<br />than you know...
6021641 6023559 [romantic music playing]
6030900 6032443 I told you, baby.
6034362 6036948 I can take care of myself.
6047750 6051045 [Thomas] I'm Thomas Wayne,<br />and I approve this message.
6051295 6053297 [triumphant music playing]
6058886 6062473 From a very young age, my family,<br />Martha's family, the Arkhams...
6062598 6064433 ...instilled in both of us
6064642 6067061 that giving back<br />is not just an obligation,
6067228 6068688 it's a passion.
6069397 6071732 That is our family's legacy.
6072942 6075278 [Riddler on TV]<br />The Waynes and the Arkhams.
6075361 6077822 Gotham's founding families.
6077905 6081075 But what is their real legacy?
6082410 6087081 Twenty years ago, one reporter set out<br />to uncover the dark truth.
6087164 6090835 He found shocking family secrets.
6091544 6093087 How, when Martha was just a child,
6093170 6095673 her mother brutally murdered her father,
6095756 6097383 - then committed suicide...<br />- [gunshot]
6097466 6103055 ...and how the Arkhams used their power<br />and money to cover it up.
6103139 6107810 How Martha herself was<br />in and out of institutions for years
6107893 6110271 and they didn't want anyone to know.
6111105 6113608 Thomas Wayne tried<br />to force this crusading reporter
6113691 6117612 into a hush-money agreement<br />to save his mayoral campaign.
6117737 6119780 [raises voice]<br />But when the reporter refused...
6120281 6124577 ...Wayne turned to longtime<br />secret associate Carmine Falcone
6124660 6127246 [laughs hysterically]<br />and had him murdered!
6127371 6130416 - [gunshot]<br />- The Waynes and the Arkhams,
6131000 6136255 Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.
6136756 6139133 I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.
6139216 6141594 This is your legacy too.
6141677 6145139 And Gotham needs you to answer
6145222 6148017 [whispering]<br />for the sins of your father.
6149560 6151395 Goodbye.
6153356 6155274 [club music playing on speakers]
6157151 6158351 Do you know who I am?
6159842 6161042 You're Bruce Wayne.
6161072 6162948 I wanna see Carmine Falcone.
6173709 6174909 See?
6175503 6176703 [scoffs]
6176754 6177954 [elevator bell dings]
6178547 6180049 [romantic old song playing on speakers]
6184783 6185983 [billiard balls clatter]
6186013 6188641 [Falcone] Who is this guy<br />who invented the ball, right?
6189392 6191519 Must have made a fortune.
6191977 6193729 If you think about it,<br />the concept of it, right?
6195231 6197692 Briscoe, do you know<br />how much this sweater cost?
6197722 6198829 [Briscoe] No, boss.
6198859 6201195 [Falcone] $1,183.
6201779 6203739 You know why communism failed, right?
6203823 6205023 [Briscoe] No, boss.
6206742 6207993 [Falcone] Austerity.
6208202 6209402 [men laugh]
6210246 6211872 [Penguin] All right. All right.
6212164 6214542 [Falcone chuckles]<br />Look at that. Perfect.
6214625 6216377 [Penguin]<br />It's never gonna be that good again.
6218587 6221090 Hey, Johnny Slick.
6221173 6222373 What are you doing here?
6224260 6226095 Give us a moment here, fellas.
6227012 6228212 [Penguin] Come on.
6229974 6231183 See ya, champ.
6232184 6233436 Come on, sweetheart.
6235396 6236596 Have a seat.
6238441 6240234 I thought I might hear from you.
6241402 6244530 This, uh,<br />Riddler son of a bitch is really...
6246073 6247867 stirring things up, huh?
6247950 6249660 - Is it true?<br />- What?
6250953 6252580 That reporter business?
6253914 6255124 What do you want to know here, kid?
6255207 6258002 Did you kill him? For my father?
6258085 6260838 Look, your father was in trouble.
6261714 6263507 This reporter had some dirt.
6263591 6265217 Some very...
6266385 6270139 personal stuff about your mother,<br />her family history.
6270222 6272933 Everybody's got their dirty laundry,<br />that's just how it is.
6273017 6274477 But he didn't want<br />none of it coming out,
6274560 6276479 not right before the election.
6276937 6279231 And your father tried<br />to pay the guy off,
6279315 6280941 but he wasn't going for it.
6281025 6284195 So, he came to me.
6284278 6286655 Well, I never seen him like that.
6287490 6289325 He said, "Carmine,
6290117 6294830 I want you to put the fear of God<br />in this guy."
6297249 6300169 And when fear isn't enough...
6300836 6302671 Oof. Hmm.
6304006 6307343 Your father wanted me to handle it,<br />so I did.
6308344 6310179 I handled it.
6311889 6313307 I know.
6313390 6315643 You thought your father was a Boy Scout.
6316894 6318729 But you'd be surprised
6318813 6321190 what even a good man like him
6321273 6323859 is capable of in the right situation.
6326111 6327571 Do me a favor.
6327905 6329949 Don't lose any sleep over it.
6330658 6332243 This reporter
6333077 6334662 was a lowlife.
6334745 6336205 He was on Maroni's payroll.
6337832 6339458 - Maroni?<br />- Oh, yeah.
6340209 6343462 He could never stand<br />your father and I had history.
6344880 6348384 And after what happened<br />with that reporter, Maroni was worried
6348467 6350803 that your father would be in my pocket,
6351554 6352754 forever.
6353222 6355266 He would have done anything
6355349 6357518 to keep him from becoming mayor.
6357601 6358936 You understand?
6360145 6364692 Are you saying Salvatore Maroni<br />got my father killed?
6364775 6366819 Do I know it for a fact?
6369238 6371323 I'm just saying,<br />it sure looked that way to me.
6372700 6374994 This is what you wanted, huh?
6375077 6377496 This little conversation here?
6377997 6379415 [exhales ruefully]
6379915 6382084 It's been a long time coming, huh?
6384712 6386839 I mean, you ain't a kid no more.
6390301 6392386 [melancholy music playing]
6436513 6438474 [EKG machine beeping]
6441936 6443604 [inhales sharply]
6448859 6450611 [rain pattering]
6453405 6454605 [sighs]
6456241 6457534 You lied to me...
6460371 6461997 my whole life.
6467169 6469213 I spoke to Carmine Falcone.
6472299 6475594 He told me what he did for my father.
6479598 6481100 About Salvatore Maroni.
6483102 6485813 He told you Salvatore Maroni...
6485896 6487648 Had my father killed.
6490109 6492319 Why didn't you tell me all this?
6495072 6499618 All these years<br />I've spent fighting for him,
6499702 6502037 believing that he was a good man.
6502121 6503706 He was a good man.
6504873 6506583 You listen to me.
6506667 6510087 Your father was a good man.
6513716 6515634 - He made a mistake.<br />- A "mistake."
6515718 6517636 He had a man killed.
6517720 6518920 Why?
6519972 6523225 [sighing] To protect his family image?
6524309 6525561 His political aspirations?
6525644 6529189 It wasn't to protect the family image,<br />and he didn't have anyone killed.
6531775 6533318 He was protecting your mother.
6534278 6537823 He didn't care about his image<br />or the campaign, any of that.
6537906 6540034 He cared about her,
6540117 6541410 and you,
6541493 6544413 and in a moment of weakness,<br />he turned to Falcone.
6544496 6547958 But he never thought Falcone<br />would kill that man.
6548834 6552171 Your father should have known<br />that Falcone would do anything
6552254 6555382 to finally have something on him<br />that he could use.
6555466 6557301 That's who Falcone is.
6559553 6561764 And that was your father's mistake.
6561847 6563891 But when Falcone<br />told him what he'd done,
6563974 6566727 your father was distraught.
6567603 6570814 He told Falcone<br />he was going to the police,
6570898 6573067 that he would confess everything.
6574568 6576570 And that night,
6576653 6580574 your father and your mother were Killed.
6582993 6585162 [soft music playing]
6586080 6587831 It was Falcone?
6592336 6593796 [smacks lips]
6593879 6596006 Oh, I wish I knew for sure.
6600719 6604264 Or maybe it was some random thug<br />on the street
6604348 6607101 who needed money, got scared,<br />and pulled the trigger too fast.
6607184 6612397 If you don't think I've spent every day<br />searching for that answer...
6614149 6618028 It was my job to protect them.<br />Do you understand?
6618695 6620489 I know you always blamed yourself.
6620572 6623117 You were only a boy, Bruce.
6625285 6627579 I could see the fear in your eyes,
6628997 6631375 but I didn't know how to help.
6631458 6633961 I could teach you how to fight, [sighs]
6635337 6638006 but I wasn't equipped<br />to take care of you.
6638090 6639925 You needed a father.
6641885 6644304 And all you had was me.
6646682 6647891 I'm sorry.
6649643 6651562 Don't be sorry, Alfred.
6658360 6659560 God.
6662489 6666910 I never thought<br />I'd feel fear like that again.
6669621 6671748 I thought I'd mastered all that.
6678172 6679423 I mean,
6680632 6682759 I'm not afraid to die.
6684511 6686889 I realize now there's something.
6688015 6689892 I haven't got past.
6690809 6692561 This fear...
6695022 6697983 of ever going through any of that again.
6702237 6704448 Of losing somebody I care about.
6705782 6708076 [soft music continues]
6732392 6734102 [soft dramatic music playing]
6737105 6738774 [engine revving]
6754853 6756053 Hey.
6756083 6758835 I saw the signal. That's not you?
6758919 6760837 I thought it was you.
6765008 6766385 [both grunting]
6773767 6775310 - I found him!<br />- I see that.
6775394 6776895 He had my shit and my phone.
6776979 6778188 She left a message<br />the night they took her.
6778218 6779243 She called me...
6779273 6780983 Gordon! Help me out, man!
6781066 6782359 She got my gun!
6782464 6783664 [grunts]
6783694 6785404 - Shut up!<br />- Put the gun down.
6786947 6789491 I'm telling you, God damn it!<br />She called me!
6794079 6796164 - [cell phone beeps]<br />- Here. Listen.
6798125 6799793 [Kenzie on recording]<br />Hey! Get back here!
6799918 6802087 - [Annika whimpering]<br />- Where you going? Come back here!
6802170 6804256 [Falcone] Hey, hey,<br />what are you doing, Kenzie?
6804339 6805674 You're scaring her.
6805757 6807467 [Kenzie] I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.
6807497 6808647 [Annika, tearfully]<br />Please, please, please.
6808677 6809970 Please, don't hurt me, please.
6810053 6812723 [Falcone]<br />Hey, don't be scared. Come here.
6814599 6816643 Now let me ask you again.
6817352 6819896 - What did Mitchell tell you?<br />- [Annika] No, nothing. He...
6819980 6822899 [Falcone] Don liked to talk.<br />I know that.
6822983 6825694 Especially to pretty girls like you.
6826236 6828238 That's why I made him<br />take your passport...
6828947 6831825 until we could have<br />this little conversation.
6831908 6834619 [Annika] All I want to do<br />is get out of here, okay?
6834703 6836830 You'll never hear from me again,<br />nobody will. Please, please...
6836913 6840042 [Falcone] We're gonna get you<br />out of here, I promise.
6840876 6843420 But first, I gotta know...
6844504 6845839 What did he tell you?
6846631 6850177 [Annika] He just said<br />they all made a deal with you.
6850677 6851887 [Falcone] Oh. Hmm.
6851970 6853930 He told you about that, huh?
6854014 6855307 The deal.
6855390 6860312 [Annika] He said you gave some<br />information on some drops thing
6860395 6863106 and that's how he became mayor.
6863190 6865567 He said you were a very important man.
6865650 6866850 [Falcone] Right.
6867527 6868904 Mm-hmm.
6869863 6872032 Hmm. Okay.
6874117 6875869 - [tussling on recording]<br />- [Annika screams]
6876828 6878330 - [Annika cries]<br />- [tussling continues]
6879706 6881041 - [Falcone] Just take it easy.<br />- [Annika choking]
6881124 6882667 Jesus, he's strangling her.
6882751 6885796 [Falcone] Take it easy.
6887923 6889341 [recording stops]
6895013 6896306 Rata Alada.
6901061 6902854 A falcon has wings too.
6903188 6905023 Falcone is the rat?
6915992 6919162 Falcone works for you guys?
6919830 6922374 The mayor? The DA?
6925377 6926577 No.
6926795 6928296 [breathing shakily]
6929548 6930841 We work for him.
6931842 6933093 Everybody does.
6933123 6934231 How?
6934261 6935846 Through Renewal.
6936638 6938014 Renewal is everything.
6938098 6939433 - The Renewal Fund?<br />- [Kenzie] Yeah.
6940016 6943728 After Thomas Wayne died,<br />they all went after it like vultures.
6943812 6947399 The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.<br />Everyone got in on it.
6947482 6950861 It was perfect for making bribes,<br />laundering money.
6950944 6953029 A huge charitable fund<br />with no oversight.
6953113 6954823 Everybody got a piece.
6954906 6956741 But Falcone wanted more.
6958535 6961746 So he orchestrated a play<br />to take Maroni down big.
6963165 6965500 He'd rat out his drops operation,
6965876 6968587 make the careers of everybody<br />that went after him,
6968670 6971131 then install them all as his puppets.
6971214 6973758 You think this goddamn election matters?
6975385 6977304 Falcone's the mayor.
6978263 6980765 He's been the mayor<br />for the last 20 years.
6980849 6982225 Come on, Vengeance.
6982934 6984769 Let's go kill that son of a bitch.
6985479 6987105 - This creep too. Let's finish this.<br />- Oh, God!
6987135 6988118 No!
6988148 6989348 [gun clatters]
6989483 6990692 We'll get him.
6991359 6993236 - But not that way.<br />- There is no other way!
6993299 6994499 He owns the city!
6994529 6995780 Cross that line...
6996573 6997866 you'll become just like him.
6998575 7000118 Listen to me.
7000202 7002078 Don't throw your life away.
7008627 7010003 Don't worry, honey.
7013089 7014549 I got nine of 'em.
7014674 7016635 - [screams]<br />- [Gordon] No, don't! Hey, hey!
7017928 7019221 [Kenzie] Oh, God! [whimpering]
7028522 7029722 [Gordon]<br />She won't get out of there alive.
7029814 7032400 And if she kills Falcone,<br />we may never find the Riddler.
7032430 7033622 I have to stop her.
7033652 7034852 Don't you mean "we"?
7035946 7037489 I gotta do this my way.
7037822 7039022 And then what?
7039699 7041076 We do what Riddler said.
7041910 7043537 Bring the rat into the light.
7046540 7048458 [dramatic music playing]
7052170 7053880 [engine roaring]
7079489 7081533 Can you tell Mr. Falcone<br />I'd like to come up?
7081616 7083076 He ain't seein' nobody tonight.
7083702 7085036 Tell him it's about Annika.
7088290 7089624 Hey!
7090458 7091876 Look who it is, huh?
7091960 7094379 - Sorry to bother you.<br />- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.
7094462 7096464 I was just hoping<br />I could talk to you for a minute?
7096631 7098091 Absolutely.
7099843 7101043 Alone?
7101469 7102669 [banging on door]
7104347 7106391 [muffled club music playing]
7117402 7118602 Hey!
7118778 7120488 [club music playing on speakers]
7129039 7130248 [tearfully] I'm just so worried.
7130332 7131958 I don't know where she is.
7133710 7137088 And I know<br />that you're a very important man.
7137172 7140592 I was hoping that maybe<br />you could help me find her...
7142093 7144471 because she's been gone so long,<br />I'm beginning to...
7144638 7145847 [inhales shakily]
7145930 7147130 I'm sorry. [sniffling]
7147203 7148403 It's okay.
7148433 7150560 - I'm so sorry.<br />- I understand. Here.
7150727 7153605 No, that's okay, I have a tissue.
7157630 7158830 Mr. Falcone?
7158860 7160320 Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?
7160403 7163323 I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think<br />you're gonna want to see this.
7165700 7167202 [Falcone] I'm sorry, beautiful.
7167285 7168703 I'll be right back.
7174834 7176544 [dramatic music playing]
7182780 7183980 [indistinct TV chatter]
7184010 7185148 Holy shit.
7185178 7186846 [newscaster]<br />That recording, provided to GC-1
7186930 7189641 by Lieutenant James Gordon<br />of the Gotham PD.
7189724 7192560 And we should warn you,<br />the contents are extremely graphic
7192644 7194854 and some of you may find it disturbing.
7195480 7198983 [Annika, tearfully] He just said<br />they all made a deal with you.
7199109 7200652 [Falcone] Oh. Hmm.
7200819 7202487 He told you about that, huh?
7202570 7204072 The deal.
7204155 7208952 [Annika] He said you gave some<br />information on some drops thing
7209035 7211955 and that's how he became mayor.
7212038 7214582 He said you were a very important man.
7214666 7215866 [Falcone] Right.
7216543 7217752 Hmm.
7217836 7219045 Okay.
7220755 7222590 - [tussling on recording]<br />- [Annika screams]
7226302 7228680 [newscaster] Revelations of<br />Mr. Falcone's secret role
7228763 7230014 as a mafia informant...
7230598 7231850 Hey, Dad.
7232892 7234092 What?
7234352 7236396 I'm Maria Kyle's kid.
7238022 7239482 You remember her?
7241526 7242726 Yeah.
7246802 7248002 Just put down the gun, honey.
7248032 7249232 This is for my mother.

7376619 7378454 You made me do this.
7379873 7381666 Just like your mother.
7382458 7383793 [Falcone grunts]
7387672 7389007 He has to pay!
7392927 7394127 You don't have to pay with him.
7394721 7396556 [Selina gasping]
7397682 7399183 You paid enough.

7434969 7437680 Look at you, man.<br />What do you think this is?
7437764 7440850 You think you're gonna scare me<br />with that mask and that cape?
7440934 7442185 I'm gonna start crying,
7442268 7444771 and all of a sudden,<br />some big secret's comin' out?
7444854 7446481 Let me tell you something.
7446564 7448274 Whatever I know,
7448358 7450234 whatever I've done,
7450318 7454656 it's all going with me to my grave.
7465208 7467168 What, are you with Zorro over here?
7468795 7471089 Don't you know you boys in blue<br />work for me?
7479013 7481349 [Gordon]<br />I guess we don't all work for you.
7481516 7482976 [indistinct radio chatter]
7490358 7491901 You have the right to remain silent.
7492735 7496239 Anything you say can and will<br />be used against you in a court of law.
7496322 7497657 You have the right to an attorney.
7497740 7498940 If you cannot afford one,
7498992 7500785 the City of Gotham<br />will provide one to you.
7500868 7502578 Do you understand these rights?
7504080 7505665 Do you understand?
7507563 7508763 [Falcone] Yeah.
7508793 7510878 I'll see you when I walk out.
7510908 7512016 [Gordon] With these rights in mind,
7512046 7513339 is there anything else<br />you wish to tell...
7513423 7514674 Goddamn rat.
7516634 7517969 What'd you say?
7518052 7519804 Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine.
7520930 7522181 Probably be your last.
7522432 7525476 Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?
7525506 7526698 Maybe I am.
7526728 7527937 Really, Oz?
7528021 7532734 Because to me, you were always<br />just a gimp in an empty suit.
7532817 7534017 I'll spray paint your ass!

7571469 7572660 [Martinez] There!
7572690 7574525 The shots came from up there!

7668369 7670329 He's been here this whole time.
7670413 7672748 - Lieutenant. Martinez.<br />- Yeah?
7672811 7674011 [Martinez]<br />Lieutenant, we got a witness here,
7674041 7676711 says she saw someone coming down<br />the fire escape right after the shot.
7676794 7679255 She said he went into the corner diner.
7679338 7682258 The guy's sitting by himself<br />at the counter, right now.

7706532 7708242 [tense music continues]
7715666 7716866 [stool creaking]
7725551 7727470 I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.
7730431 7731724 [Martinez] Stay still!
7731807 7733007 Now!

7739732 7741359 [tense music continues]
7761462 7763256 [Martinez] Which one is you?
7763339 7764840 [laughs gleefully] You tell me.
7765675 7767134 Let's go, pencil-neck.
7770221 7771973 Get that son of a bitch out of here!

7789490 7792076 have gathered<br />in an emotional show of city unity.
7792159 7794745 Our Dan O'Neil is live<br />inside Real's headquarters right now...
7794829 7796029 Hey.
7799000 7800543 [suspenseful music playing]
7820313 7822023 What are all these diaries?
7822106 7824525 They're ledgers. He's got thousands.
7824608 7828154 He scrawled all over 'em.<br />Rambling, ciphers, codes.
7828237 7829780 Got something back on one of the IDs.
7829864 7832158 Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.
7832241 7834076 - He's a forensic accountant.<br />- Accountant?
7834160 7836579 Hey, Lieutenant!<br />You really okay with this?
7836662 7838414 What about chain of evidence?
7839248 7840458 You should see this.
7846422 7847923 He's wearing gloves.
7849383 7851635 "Friday, July 16th.
7851719 7855431 My life has been a cruel riddle<br />I could not solve,
7855765 7858809 suffocating my mind, no escape.
7858893 7860311 But then, today, I saw it.
7860394 7864523 A single word on this ledger,<br />sitting on the desk beside me.
7865858 7867651 'Renewal.'
7867735 7872156 The empty promise they sold to me<br />as a child in that orphanage.
7872239 7875368 One look inside,<br />and finally I understood.
7875451 7878788 My whole life<br />has been preparing me for this.
7878871 7881332 The moment when I would learn the truth.
7881415 7884418 When I could finally strike back<br />and expose their lies."
7885544 7887380 - [rats squeaking]<br />- "If you want people to understand,
7887463 7889298 really understand,
7889382 7891675 you can't just give them the answers.
7891759 7893219 You have to confront them,
7893302 7895721 torture them<br />with the horrifying questions,
7895805 7897973 just like they tortured me.
7898057 7900851 I know now what I must become."
7903813 7905147 Jesus.
7905314 7906514 [bat screeching]
7911237 7913197 I don't think that rat likes you, man.
7913739 7915241 This one's not a rat.
7915658 7917660 - [rats continue squeaking]<br />- [cages rattling]
7921872 7923072 [screeching violently]
7931882 7933082 [Gordon] What is that?
7935719 7937221 [bat screeching frantically]
7964623 7965833 [officer] Some kind of pry tool?
7965916 7967293 Is it a chisel?
7967376 7968836 [Batman] It's a murder weapon.
7968919 7970296 He killed Mitchell with it.
7970963 7973841 The edge will match the floorboard<br />impression in the mayor's study.
7982433 7984435 "My confession"?
7984518 7987396 What's he confessing to?<br />He already told us he killed Mitchell.
7987480 7988856 This isn't over.
7988939 7991358 [officer 2] Oh, man. He's been posting<br />all kinds of shit online.
7991775 7993986 He's got, like, 500 followers.<br />Real fringe types.
7994361 7995654 [typing]
8002077 8004288 His final post was last night.
8004371 8007583 Some video. Got a lot of views,<br />but it's password-protected.
8007666 8010669 - [Gordon] Can you get in?<br />- [officer 2] Copying his drive now.
8010794 8014215 Take some time, but we'll get in.
8014715 8016300 [ominous music playing]
8025559 8028103 - [Gordon] Show me the post.<br />- [officer 2] It's right here.
8029730 8031440 [Gordon] "The Truth Unmasked."
8032274 8033901 I think I'm his last target.
8036487 8037687 You?
8037947 8039990 Maybe this is all coming to an end.
8040533 8041909 What is?
8042368 8043786 The Batman.
8044036 8045236 [cell phone ringing]
8049166 8050366 Yeah?
8061637 8062846 Right.
8065724 8069687 Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.
8077152 8078654 You're a good cop.
8103262 8105639 [over speaker]<br />I told you I'd see you in hell.
8106390 8108225 [Batman] What do you want from me?
8108309 8109852 [Riddler] "Want"?
8110436 8114064 If only you knew how long<br />I've been waiting for this day.
8115274 8116609 For this moment.
8117651 8120654 I've been invisible my whole life.
8121739 8124366 I guess I won't be anymore, will 1?
8125909 8128329 They'll remember me now.
8128412 8130247 They'll remember both of us.
8140633 8142593 Bruce...
8145471 8147306 Wayne.
8149683 8153437 [slowly] Bruce...
8154855 8157733 Wayne.
8163489 8164689 [exhales deeply]
8168994 8171413 You know, I was there that day.
8173999 8177378 The day the great Thomas Wayne<br />announced he was running for mayor,
8177461 8179838 made all those promises.
8182299 8186553 Well, a week later he was dead,<br />and everybody just forgot about us.
8187096 8190641 All they could talk about<br />was poor Bruce Wayne.
8190724 8194395 Bruce Wayne, the orphan.
8194978 8196522 Orphan.
8202194 8207324 Living in some tower over the park<br />isn't being an orphan.
8208617 8213247 Looking down on everyone,<br />with all that money.
8213914 8215457 Don't you tell me.
8218085 8220754 Do you know what being an orphan is?
8221130 8223716 It's 30 kids to a room.
8225008 8229054 Twelve years old and already a drophead,<br />numbing the pain.
8230764 8235436 You wake up screaming<br />with rats chewing your fingers.
8236603 8239773 And every winter one of the babies die
8239857 8242151 because it's so cold.
8243444 8246029 But, oh, no.
8247322 8248574 [smacks lips]
8248949 8252119 Let's talk about the billionaire<br />with the lying, dead daddy
8252202 8255122 because at least the money<br />makes it go down easy.
8255205 8256405 Doesn't it?
8257666 8259710 Bruce...
8260753 8262671 Wayne.
8266341 8269428 He's the only one we didn't get.
8272848 8275976 But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?
8277436 8281315 All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.
8284485 8285685 God.
8286653 8287946 Look at you.
8289615 8292075 Your mask is amazing.
8292159 8295078 I wish you could've seen me in mine.
8295108 8296300 Ain't it funny?
8296330 8300751 All everyone wants to do is unmask you,<br />but they're missing the point.
8302211 8304254 You and I both know.
8305214 8307716 I'm looking at the real you right now.
8307800 8311428 My mask allowed me<br />to be myself completely.
8311512 8313055 No shame,
8313827 8315027 no limits.
8315057 8316725 Why did you write me?
8317455 8318655 What do you mean?
8318685 8320395 All those cards.
8320479 8321688 I told you,
8322397 8324316 we've been doing this together.<br />You're a part of this.
8324399 8326610 - We didn't do anything together.<br />- We did.
8326693 8328153 What did we just do?
8328237 8330239 I asked you to bring him into the light,<br />and you did.
8330322 8331522 We're such a good team.
8331552 8332628 We're not a team.
8332658 8335160 I never could have<br />gotten him out of there.
8335244 8337663 I'm not physical.<br />My strength is up here.
8337746 8340916 I mean, I had all the pieces,<br />I had the answers.
8340999 8342626 But I didn't know<br />how to make them listen.
8342709 8343919 You gave me that.
8343982 8345182 I gave you nothing.
8345212 8347798 You showed me what was possible.
8347881 8352761 You showed me all it takes is fear<br />and a little focused violence.
8352845 8354388 You inspired me.
8354471 8355973 You're out of your goddamn mind.
8357037 8358237 What?
8358267 8360435 This is all in your head.<br />You're sick, twisted.
8360519 8361895 How can you say that?
8361979 8363480 You think you'll be remembered?
8363564 8365232 You're a pathetic psychopath,
8365732 8367484 - begging for attention.<br />- No.
8367568 8369236 - You're gonna die alone in Arkham.<br />- No.
8369266 8370415 No, no!
8370445 8371645 A nobody!
8373156 8374950 No!
8376869 8379246 Ahhh!
8379496 8382082 This is not how this was supposed to go!
8383041 8386670 Ahhh!
8386753 8389381 I had it all planned out!
8390382 8392384 We were gonna be safe here.
8392759 8396054 We could watch the whole thing together.
8396084 8397192 Watch what?
8397222 8398974 Everything!
8400726 8402144 [tense music playing]
8407316 8408984 It was all there.
8411153 8413488 You mean, you didn't figure it out?
8414656 8415866 [Riddler gasps slowly]
8417784 8421705 Oh, you're really not as smart<br />as I thought you were.
8423749 8425834 I guess I gave you too much credit.
8426293 8427544 What have you done?
8428253 8433133 What's black and blue and dead all over?
8435969 8437804 You.
8439473 8441600 If you think you can stop<br />what's coming...
8442935 8444478 What have you done?
8446021 8451860 [sings in falsetto] Ave Maria
8452277 8454154 [shouting] What have you done?
8456615 8457991 Gratia plena
8458158 8459576 What have you done?
8460202 8461402 [growls]
8463580 8466959 Maria
8467125 8472673 Gratia plena
8477719 8479179 [suspenseful music playing]
8504538 8505914 [Martinez] Hey!
8506915 8508208 What are you doing in here?
8526143 8528729 Hey, man, I don't think that<br />you should be touching that.
8532232 8533432 [bottles clink]
8535318 8537779 Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?
8538655 8541408 Killing Mitchell<br />with a friggin' carpet tool.
8546079 8549124 My uncle's a... He's an installer.
8549207 8551376 You know, it's a... Oh, you know.
8551460 8553712 It's a tucker.
8554046 8555714 [suspenseful music continues]
8571521 8572721 Huh.
8587704 8590499 Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!<br />What are you doing?
8590582 8592084 What are you doing?
8601051 8602636 [suspenseful music builds up]
8606640 8608308 [dramatic music playing]
8622614 8624032 [Riddler] Hey, guys.
8624366 8626576 Uh, thanks for all the comments
8626660 8629621 and a special thanks to everyone<br />for the tips on detonators.
8629651 8630759 Detonators?
8630789 8635836 I just want to say this will be my last<br />post for a little while, and, uh...
8638088 8640173 what this community has meant to me
8640257 8643260 these weeks, these months,
8644177 8646596 let's just say none of us...
8648306 8650433 is alone anymore. Okay?
8651143 8652343 Jesus.
8652519 8653719 [Riddler huffing]
8655460 8656660 [inhales deeply]
8656690 8659276 Tomorrow's Election Day.
8659442 8661069 [laughing]
8661862 8664489 And Bella Real will win.
8664573 8667200 She promised real change.
8667909 8670287 But we know the truth, don't we?
8670370 8672455 You've seen Gotham's true face now.
8672539 8674416 Together, we've unmasked it.
8674499 8677460 Its corruption, its perversion
8677544 8681381 masquerading under the guise of renewal.
8681464 8685302 But unmasking is not enough.
8687512 8691516 The day of judgment is finally upon us.
8691600 8693977 [in playful tone] And now it is time
8695061 8697439 for retribution.
8697522 8700317 I've parked seven vans
8700609 8702944 all along the city seawall.
8704154 8706031 And on the big night,
8706114 8708366 [whispers] they will go boom.
8712120 8713830 [dramatic music playing]
8719252 8720670 [explosion]
8722631 8723882 - [explosion]<br />- [inaudible] Boom!
8729137 8730597 - [explosion]<br />- [inaudible] Boom!
8733266 8735518 When the vans blow,
8735602 8741233 the flooding will happen so fast,<br />evacuation will not be an option.
8741566 8744527 Those who are not washed away
8744611 8747614 will race through the streets in terror.
8747644 8748835 - [panicked screams]<br />- Call Gordon.
8748865 8750992 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
8752577 8754204 - [crowd cheering]<br />- [Riddler] As breaking news
8754287 8756206 hits higher ground<br />in Gotham Square Garden...
8756331 8759292 ...celebrations will turn to panic,
8759376 8764214 as the venue becomes<br />the city's shelter of last resort.
8764297 8765497 [sirens wailing]
8765590 8769594 And that's where all of you come in.
8776017 8779312 Now, when the time arrives,<br />I will already be unmasked.
8779396 8781564 The pigs will have me in their custody,
8781648 8783692 but that's okay.
8783775 8788280 Because then it will be your turn.
8788363 8792242 You'll be there, waiting.
8792450 8794244 [dramatic music playing]
8803295 8806214 It's time for the lies to finally end.
8806298 8810427 [dramatically]<br />False promises of renewal?
8810510 8811710 Change?
8812012 8815807 We'll give them real, real change now.
8815890 8820895 We've spent our lives in this<br />wretched place, [shouts] suffering!
8821354 8823857 Wondering, "Why us?"
8823940 8827068 Now they will spend<br />their last moments wondering,
8827152 8829321 [screams] why them?
8829404 8831448 I can't get through! The lines are down.
8832782 8834075 [sirens wailing]
8837078 8839247 Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!
8839831 8841458 I'm just trying to get out of town, man!
8841541 8844419 Lady, we got bombs going off.<br />The whole city's flooding.
8844502 8846463 You're gonna have to go inside<br />the Garden with everyone else.
8846546 8847746 [distant explosion]
8848006 8849632 [people screaming]
8851593 8852793 [crowd clamoring]
8853636 8854836 [sirens wailing]
8856097 8857766 - Lieutenant, who's in charge?<br />- I really don't know.
8857849 8859351 We're just trying<br />to get a handle here, sir.
8859434 8861269 Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!
8861353 8862604 We got an active situation.
8862729 8864022 We need to sweep the building<br />for explosives
8864105 8865315 and get the mayor-elect<br />out of here, now.
8865345 8866369 - Where is she?<br />- I can take you there.
8866399 8867287 Come!
8867317 8868610 [crowd chattering]
8870236 8871436 [tense music playing]
8903269 8904687 - [man] If we don't close the doors...<br />- MCU.
8904717 8905700 ...we're gonna have huge problems.
8905730 8907107 The water's already started to breach.
8907190 8908733 I thought this was<br />a shelter of last resort.
8908817 8911027 [man] Yeah, for a hurricane,<br />but not if the whole seawall comes down.
8911111 8912946 [Bella] am not gonna let<br />those people die out there.
8913029 8915365 All right. I'll go calm down the crowd<br />SO we can get everyone in.
8915448 8917700 It's not safe for you here.<br />We need to get you out, Ms. Real.
8917784 8920036 - I'm not going anywhere.<br />- We're under attack, ma'am.
8920120 8921955 Exactly! That's the problem<br />with this city.
8922038 8925041 Everyone's afraid to stand up<br />and do the right thing, but I'm not.
8925125 8926626 - Excuse me.<br />- Ma'am...
8931798 8935260 Everyone, everyone,<br />if I could just get your attention.
8935343 8937637 Please! I just need your attention!
8940286 8941486 [gasps]
8941516 8942716 - [gunshot]<br />- [crowd exclaiming]
8944373 8945573 [Bella groaning]
8945603 8947105 - [gunshots]<br />- [crowd screaming]
8949899 8951109 [gunshots]
8953528 8954728 You're okay!

9182256 9183269 [breathing laboriously]
9183299 9184499 It's okay.
9185968 9188096 It's done now. It's done.

9254579 9255788 [panting]
9283065 9284265 Jesus.
9290740 9291940 [panting]
9294035 9295703 Who the hell are you?
9299916 9301116 Me?
9304086 9305505 I'm Vengeance.
9306464 9308007 [low, menacing music playing]

9517967 9520261 [Bruce] Wednesday, November 6th.
9520428 9522096 [siren wailing in distance]
9523472 9525349 The city is underwater.
9527685 9529437 The National Guard is coming.
9531731 9533733 Martial law is in effect...
9534650 9536277 but the criminal element never sleeps.
9539488 9543200 Looting and lawlessness will be rampant
9543284 9545828 in the parts of the city<br />no one can get to.
9546996 9550708 I can already see things will get worse<br />before they get better.
9553669 9556797 And some will seize the chance<br />to grab everything they can.
9558174 9559550 [Bella] We will rebuild.
9560176 9561635 But not just our city.
9562344 9566557 We must rebuild people's faith<br />in our institutions,
9566640 9568726 in our elected officials,
9568809 9570102 in each other.
9570895 9574231 Together, we will learn<br />to believe in Gotham again.
9574378 9575578 [woman speaks indistinctly]
9575608 9576901 [helicopter blades whirring]
9578569 9580237 [Bruce] I'm starting to see now.
9581697 9583866 I have had an effect here...
9585951 9587870 but not the one I intended.
9590247 9593292 Vengeance won't change the past,
9594627 9597004 mine or anyone else's.
9599423 9601467 I have to become more.
9604553 9606180 People need hope.
9607389 9609600 To know someone's out there for them.
9613395 9615064 The city's angry,
9615981 9617358 scarred,
9618275 9619527 like me.
9621654 9623739 Our scars can destroy us.
9625116 9627827 Even after<br />the physical wounds have healed.
9629453 9631205 But if we survive them,
9632706 9634583 they can transform us.
9636460 9638379 They can give us the power
9639338 9640840 lo endure...
9642216 9644343 and the strength to fight.
9647263 9649431 [reporter]<br />We are live. As you can see,
9649515 9652309 the masked vigilante<br />atop Gotham Square Garden
9652393 9653978 helping to save the lives
9654061 9655688 - of hundreds of victims.<br />- [Riddler moaning]
9655771 9658774 And now as first responders desperately<br />scramble to help the injured,
9658858 9661402 a mysterious masked man emerges,
9661485 9663821 heroically pulling the victims<br />right through that skylight...
9663904 9666365 [man] Isn't that just terrible?
9667741 9669660 Him...
9669743 9672621 raining on your parade like that?
9672788 9673988 [tutting]
9678335 9680337 What is it they say?
9681505 9683674 "One day you're on top,
9685217 9686886 the next...
9688262 9690181 you're a clown."
9690848 9692224 [exhales ruefully]
9692558 9693758 Well,
9695519 9698355 let me tell you,<br />there are worse things to be.
9698564 9699764 [Riddler weeping]
9700649 9703319 Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.
9704612 9706447 You did so well.
9710951 9712151 And you know,
9713621 9716832 Gotham loves a comeback story.
9726884 9728260 [Riddler] Who are you?
9728802 9731222 [man] Well, that's the question,
9732473 9733673 isn't it?
9736560 9738938 Riddle me this...
9741398 9743525 "The less of them you have,
9744276 9748113 the more one is worth."
9753535 9755287 A friend.
9759416 9760834 [laughing maniacally]
9766799 9769009 [both laughing maniacally]
9781522 9782722 - [Batman] You're leaving.<br />- [gasps]
9783440 9784640 [Selina] Jesus.
9786277 9787861 Don't you ever just say hello?
9790406 9791606 [cat meows]
9792950 9794368 Where will you go?
9795869 9798289 I don't know. Upstate.
9798706 9800416 Bludhaven, maybe.
9801292 9802492 Why?
9803502 9804712 You asking me to stay?
9811760 9813887 You know this place<br />is never gonna change.
9814305 9816640 With Carmine gone,<br />it's only gonna get worse for you.
9816724 9818642 There's gonna be a power grab.
9820269 9821469 It'll be bloody.
9822021 9823230 I know.
9824711 9825911 But the city can change.
9825941 9827192 It won't.
9828173 9829373 I have to try.
9829403 9831196 It's gonna kill you eventually.<br />You know that.
9833490 9834690 Listen.
9837036 9838287 Why don't you come with me?
9839246 9840748 Get into some trouble.
9841498 9845002 Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.<br />It'll be fun.
9845669 9847296 The bat and the cat.
9848797 9850466 It's got a nice ring.
9862061 9863261 [scoffs]
9863812 9865230 Who am I kidding?
9866690 9868817 You're already spoken for.
9870736 9872613 [soft music playing]
9880704 9882122 You should go.
9890464 9891664 Selina...
9895552 9897221 Take care of yourself.
9909024 9910224 [engine starts]
