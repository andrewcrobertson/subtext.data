89322 90523 [man] Hey!
117183 120053 [newscaster on TV] ...a dark and stormy Halloween.
120120 122322 [news jingle plays on TV]
123923 127060 Good evening and welcome to GC-1 News live at 8:00.
127127 128761 Our top story tonight,
128828 129896 just-released polls
129963 131498 have incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.
131564 133099 and 28-year-old grassroots challenger
133166 134868 Bella Real in a dead heat.
134934 136769 Things certainly got hot last night
136836 140106 in their final debate before next Tuesday's election.
140173 141808 Now, my young opponent here
141875 144210 wants to gut the Gotham Renewal Program,
144277 145979 established by the great Thomas Wayne.
146045 147914 Cutting funds from vital projects
147981 149349 like our seawall,
149415 150383 and the safety net for those who need it.
150450 152418 The Renewal Program is broken.
152485 154587 This city's been renewing for 20 years.
154654 157524 Look where it's gotten us. Crime has skyrocketed.
157590 158992 Murder and drug use are at historic highs.
159058 160593 Now wait... Now hang on.
160660 162328 We have a masked vigilante running the street.
162395 163763 Under my administration,
163830 165465 the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
165532 167333 to organized crime and drug trafficking.
167400 168868 The Salvatore Maroni case
168935 170803 was the biggest drug bust in city history.
170870 173006 But drops and other drugs are still rampant.
173072 174541 -It's gotten worse. -I'm not saying...
174607 175708 I'm not saying there isn't work to do.
175775 177510 -But listen... -[phone rings]
177577 178811 ...I have a beautiful wife and young son, okay?
178878 179979 -And I will not rest... -[mutes TV]
182081 183383 [picks up phone]
184284 185285 Hey.
185351 187587 [low eerie music playing]
187654 189589 Yeah, I'm watching it now.
189656 190924 [TV muted]
195028 196663 Why is she still tied?
198198 200867 But...
200934 204337 But I thought we were getting a bump in the new Post poll.
211211 212478 Okay, you know what?
212545 213746 I can't... I can't watch this anymore.
213813 215715 Just call me in the morning, okay?
215782 216783 [phone beeps]
218685 219986 [Don on TV] ...who still believes
220053 221621 in everything this city can do.
221688 222589 [Bella] We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
222655 224190 not a cheerleader.
224257 226693 And someone who will tell the people the truth.
226759 227961 [applause on TV]
228027 229395 [switches TV off]
236302 237670 [masked man yells]
241541 243743 [panting and grunting]
247880 250283 [panting heavily]
260393 263329 [exhales slowly]
275842 279045 [breathing deeply and heavily]
305405 308908 [Bruce] Thursday, October 31st.
308975 310543 [crackling]
318151 321020 [car horns honking]
321087 324090 The city streets are crowded for the holiday.
327226 328961 Even with the rain.
329028 330697 [chatter and laughter]
332165 336602 Hidden in the chaos is the element
336669 338938 waiting to strike like snakes.
340340 341941 But I'm there too.
342975 344744 Watching.
346212 347947 Two years of nights
348014 350717 have turned me into a nocturnal animal.
355822 358858 I must choose my targets carefully.
360326 361994 [suspenseful music playing]
362061 363830 [indistinct TV chatter]
370169 371537 [entry bell chimes]
372171 373339 [gunman] Come on!
373406 375208 -Give me the money. -[cashier] Okay.
375274 377076 -[gunman] Let's go! Let's go! -[cashier] All right, all right!
377143 378745 [Bruce] It's a big city.
383249 385017 I can't be everywhere.
388388 390523 -[rowdy laughter] -[grunts]
390590 392125 [cheers and laughter]
395261 397597 But they don't know where I am.
401534 404537 -[laughter] -Look at this guy, man.
409675 412145 -Boom! -[gang] Whoo-hoo-hoo!
415348 417517 [gang member 1] So good, man. That's what I'm talking about!
417583 419018 [gang member 2] Yo, let's see your hits.
419685 421187 That's you.
422188 424090 [tense music playing]
441340 445678 [Bruce] We have a signal now. For when I'm needed.
447046 450283 But when that light hits the sky,
450349 452552 it's not just a call.
454020 455655 It's a warning.
457290 458491 To them.
461861 464063 [helicopter blades whirring]
468034 469769 Fear...
469836 472405 [uneasy music playing]
472472 474507 ...is a tool.
483516 485318 -[tires screech] -[car horn blares]
485384 486786 [driver] Are you out of your mind?
486853 488721 Watch where you're goin', drophead!
500199 502835 [Bruce] They think I'm hiding in the shadows.
502902 505338 [heroic music playing]
505404 507006 -[sirens wailing] -[thug] Come on!
515114 517250 [Bruce] But I am the shadows.
526526 528127 [brakes screech]
529195 530062 [PA chimes]
530129 532298 [indistinct announcement on PA]
535968 537169 [gang leader] Come on, come on.
537236 538971 [gang member] Whoo.
539038 540239 -Hey, go on, man! Go! -Get him!
540306 542642 -Come on, man! -What are you doin'?
542708 544110 -[man] Help! -[gang laughs]
544176 545344 Somebody help me!
546178 548180 Help, help!
549782 551317 [gang jeering]
553819 555087 [gang laughs]
555154 556556 [gang member 1] Where you goin', huh?
556622 558291 [gang member laughing derisively]
560860 563829 -Come on. -Come on, man. Break it.
565765 567533 You can't move, huh?
567600 569368 Now knock his ass out.
569435 571571 Showtime. Showtime, man.
571637 572705 Come on, man.
572772 574173 Come on. Do it, man.
575408 577677 [muffled clanging]
577743 580279 -[menacing music playing] -[footsteps approaching]
596495 598664 [footsteps coming closer]
607273 609542 [laughing]
609609 611310 You see this guy?
618084 619986 The hell are you supposed to be?
626292 627860 [gang leader grunting]
633132 634400 [water splashes]
636802 638237 I'm vengeance.
639305 641240 Holy shit. It's him.
647847 649048 [yelps]
652251 653686 [gang grunting]
659759 661060 [chokes]
661127 662428 [grunting]
666999 668300 Hey, man. No, no, no!
672838 674407 [groaning]
706539 708741 [man breathing raggedly]
709675 711177 Please don't hurt me.
738037 740239 [soft music playing]
741440 743075 [hushed chatter]
747113 748981 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
749949 751884 Police action.
751951 753886 He's with me, Officer.
755888 758224 Are you kidding me, sir?
758290 760826 You're gonna let him in here?
760893 763896 Martinez, let him through.
766665 768134 [Martinez sighs]
777510 779311 Goddamn freak.
794860 796128 What do we know?
806772 808541 Detective?
808607 810943 Sorry, Lieutenant.
811010 816148 We got blunt force trauma. Lacerations on the head.
816215 819552 He got hit a lot of times. And hard.
822488 824690 All this blood is from his head?
824757 825958 No.
830029 831397 Excuse me.
833632 835534 Most of it's from his hand.
840906 842141 Thumb was severed.
843442 846045 Killer may have taken it as a trophy.
846111 848214 [Batman] He was alive when it was cut off.
849448 851917 Ecchymosis
851984 853619 around the wound.
868601 870269 [lead detective] Security detail downstairs
870336 873005 said the family was out trick-or-treatin'.
874206 876575 The mayor was up here alone.
878711 881680 Killer may have come through the skylight.
887920 889788 [Gordon] You said there was a card.
889855 891523 [lead detective] Yeah.
901433 904670 [Gordon] "From your secret friend. Whoo?
905905 907473 Haven't a clue?
907539 911010 Let's play a game, just me and you.
911076 913712 What does a liar do when he's dead?"
914980 917249 There's a cipher too.
923656 925958 Any of this mean anything to you?
928193 929561 What's going on here?
932398 933933 I asked him to come, Pete.
933999 935834 [Pete] This is a crime scene.
935901 938103 It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!
938170 940139 I got the press downstairs.
940205 942007 You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
942074 943075 'cause we got history.
943142 945144 But this is way over the line.
948681 950115 Wait.
950182 951617 -He's involved in this? -No, he's not involved.
951684 953052 How do you know?
953118 955721 He's a goddamn vigilante! He could be a suspect!
955788 957489 What are you doin' to me? We used to be partners.
957556 959458 [Gordon] I'm just trying to find the connection, Pete.
959525 961160 He lies still.
962561 963562 Excuse me?
964997 966465 The riddle.
966532 968867 What does a liar do when he's dead?
968934 970269 He lies still.
979144 980746 Oh, Jesus.
983749 986785 This must be your favorite night of the year, huh, pal?
987786 990222 Happy fuckin' Halloween.
990289 992992 [Martinez] Excuse me, Commissioner.
993058 994793 They're ready for your statement.
998831 1000599 I want him outta here.
1001100 1002368 Now!
1008841 1010209 Come on.
1014079 1015547 [camera shutter clicking]
1022821 1024189 Yeah.
1025190 1026725 The kid found him.
1031530 1032831 [detective] Was there anyone else
1032898 1034733 in the house when you arrived?
1036935 1039204 [melancholy song playing]
1051083 1053419 We really gotta go, man.
1058657 1063028 [Pete] Tonight, a son lost a father.
1063095 1065164 A wife lost a husband.
1066098 1068467 And I lost a friend.
1068534 1070969 Mayor Mitchell was a fighter for the city,
1071036 1074606 and I will not rest until his killer is found.
1074673 1077543 This was a truly senseless crime,
1077609 1079078 and we are actively pursuing
1079144 1081146 every investigative lead we have
1081213 1083882 in order to identify the perpetrator
1083949 1085284 and hunt him down.
1085350 1086952 I've spoken to the governor...
1087019 1089688 [Bruce] I wish I could say I'm making a difference,
1089755 1091190 but I don't know.
1091256 1093625 [melancholy song continues]
1097129 1099832 Murder, robberies, assault.
1099898 1102901 Two years later, they're all up.
1102968 1104436 And now this.
1106371 1108240 The city's eating itself.
1110609 1112211 Maybe it's beyond saving.
1114079 1116515 But I have to try.
1117249 1118650 Push myself.
1121620 1124189 [melancholy song continues]
1137970 1139471 [engine revving]
1148947 1150682 [bats chittering]
1164663 1167466 These nights all roll together in a rush,
1168233 1170369 behind the mask.
1174573 1177209 Sometimes in the morning,
1178644 1180946 I have to force myself to remember
1183248 1184917 everything that happened.
1186251 1187953 [groaning]
1198430 1200199 [newscaster on TV] Unbelievable breaking news
1200265 1201833 this hour, everyone.
1201900 1204803 Again, four-term incumbent Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.
1204870 1207706 was found murdered last night inside his home
1207773 1209608 in the exclusive Crest Hill district.
1209675 1211577 [newscaster 2] Exact details of the crime
1211643 1213045 still have not been released,
1213111 1215847 but a citywide manhunt is already underway
1215914 1219117 as police and FBI search for the brazen killer.
1219184 1221320 And this certainly is not the first time
1221386 1222688 Gotham has been rocked
1222754 1224256 by the murder of a political figure.
1224323 1226124 In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
1226191 1228093 it was 20 years ago this week
1228160 1229828 that celebrated billionaire philanthropist
1229895 1231897 Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha
1231964 1235033 were slain during Wayne's own mayoral campaign.
1235100 1236435 It was a shocking crime
1236501 1238770 that remains unsolved to this day.
1238837 1240739 Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career
1240806 1243475 was especially notable for his tough war on drugs
1243542 1244810 when he and city police
1244876 1246945 launched a major sting operation
1247012 1248580 resulting in the arrest
1248647 1250983 of notorious mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni,
1251049 1252584 with what, to this day,
1252651 1255220 remains the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.
1255287 1256555 I assume you heard about this.
1256622 1258423 [newscaster 2 continues indistinctly]
1258490 1259891 -Yeah. -[video fast-forwarding]
1266865 1268734 Oh, I see.
1268800 1270936 [Gordon on video] All this blood is from his head?
1271370 1272738 Dear God.
1281346 1283582 [lead detective] There's a cipher too.
1291189 1294393 [Gordon] Any of this mean anything to you?
1294459 1296695 [camera shutter clicking]
1296762 1298797 The killer left this for the Batman?
1299931 1301867 [Gordon] I asked him to come, Pete.
1301933 1302934 Apparently.
1303001 1305070 You're becoming quite a celebrity.
1307072 1308373 Why is he writing to you?
1308440 1309975 [Pete] It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!
1310042 1311376 I don't know yet.
1311443 1312744 [Pete] I got the press downstairs.
1314446 1315981 Have a shower.
1317149 1319051 Our accounting friends at Wayne Enterprises
1319117 1320118 are coming for breakfast.
1320185 1321887 Here? Why?
1321953 1323789 Because I couldn't get you to go there.
1323855 1326224 -I haven't got time for this. -It's getting serious, Bruce.
1326291 1327592 If this continues,
1327659 1329361 it won't be long before you've nothing left.
1329428 1331096 I don't care about that.
1331897 1333031 Any of that.
1333098 1334599 You don't care about your family's legacy?
1336802 1340105 What I'm doing is my family's legacy.
1340172 1342674 If I can't change things here,
1342741 1345677 if I can't have an effect,
1345744 1347512 then I don't care what happens to me.
1347579 1348847 That's what I'm afraid of.
1348914 1350515 Alfred, stop.
1351650 1353418 You're not my father.
1356054 1357589 I'm well aware.
1359558 1362327 [somber music playing]
1362394 1364062 [machine whirs]
1391623 1394025 [Gordon on video] We really gotta go, man.
1402768 1405137 [soft classical music playing]
1419684 1421553 Some fresh berries there.
1428393 1429761 What are you doing?
1429828 1433965 Just reminiscing about my days in the Circus.
1434032 1438069 [inhales sharply] This is actually quite elusive.
1440872 1442541 [Bruce] Where'd you get those O's?
1442607 1443975 [Alfred smack lips]
1444042 1446878 "He lies still" is only a partial key.
1446945 1449281 It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.
1449347 1452517 So, I'm looking for any double symbols to start,
1452584 1453685 trying letters,
1453752 1455153 see where it leads.
1456855 1458056 That's interesting.
1459291 1460625 [woman] Mr. Pennyworth?
1460692 1462060 Yes, Dory?
1462127 1463495 The accountants are here.
1463562 1465630 See them in, please, Dory.
1468133 1470602 [Bruce] What if it's not a partial key?
1470669 1472304 What do you mean?
1472370 1474840 What if this is the whole key?
1474906 1477542 Ignore the symbols we don't have letters for.
1477609 1479077 Use only the letters from "He lies still"
1479144 1480912 -and leave the rest... -Blank. Yeah, I understand.
1480979 1483081 But that would leave most of the cipher unsolved.
1483148 1484950 I don't see how that's gonna...
1485016 1487519 [suspenseful music playing]
1487586 1488787 Oh.
1502300 1503802 [Gordon] Damn.
1503869 1507339 Yeah, he's got a car.
1507405 1509708 Guess it's good to be the mayor.
1509774 1511843 Where to even start?
1511910 1514679 You sure this isn't a leap? "Drive" could mean anything.
1514746 1516448 [Batman] You don't trust me?
1516515 1518216 You mean like you trust me?
1518283 1519518 It's been two years now,
1519584 1521186 and I don't even know who you are, man.
1523088 1524189 [Batman] There.
1526358 1528727 [suspenseful music continues]
1536268 1537669 [air hissing]
1547345 1549214 What are we looking for?
1549281 1550916 A USB port.
1550982 1552083 USB?
1552150 1553318 [whirring]
1559157 1560292 What?
1565597 1567999 "Thumb" drive.
1568633 1570335 Jesus.
1573838 1575640 It's encrypted.
1578977 1580211 Try this.
1586985 1589688 Oh, this guy's hilarious.
1593758 1594960 -[key clacks] -[beep]
1598363 1601333 Oh, well, well, well.
1601399 1603668 So much for family values.
1603735 1605136 Who is she?
1605203 1607272 No idea.
1607339 1610408 But that's the Penguin, Carmine Falcone's right hand.
1610475 1612577 -I know who he is. -[notification whooshing]
1612644 1613845 What was that?
1614813 1618850 Shit, shit, shit! The drive.
1618917 1621252 It sent out the photos from my account.
1621319 1624189 Gotham Post, Gazette, GC-1, all of them.
1624255 1626024 Jesus.
1626091 1628627 I'm gonna catch hell for this. Pete's gonna bust a gasket.
1628693 1630295 "He lies still."
1630362 1631396 About her?
1632597 1634332 Maybe.
1634399 1636167 That's the Iceberg Lounge.
1636234 1639704 It's under the Shoreline Lofts where Falcone was holed up.
1639771 1642073 Never get in there without a warrant.
1644342 1645410 Yeah.
1646811 1649214 [train rumbles past]
1656221 1658423 [muffled dance music playing]
1658490 1659858 Know who I am?
1660925 1663628 Yeah. I got an idea.
1663695 1665730 I want to see the Penguin.
1665797 1668199 I don't know what you're talking about, pal.
1673471 1674673 What's the problem?
1674739 1675940 Says he wants to see the Penguin.
1676007 1678076 Penguin? There's no Penguin here.
1678143 1679844 That's what I tried to tell him.
1679911 1682147 Get out of here, freak. You hear me?
1682213 1684315 Or that little suit's gonna get all full of blood.
1685617 1686885 Mine or yours?
1692691 1694859 [dance music continues on speakers]
1694926 1695960 [twin 1] Get him!
1696027 1697328 [woman] I saw that whole thing.
1697395 1698563 [twin 1] He's over there!
1698630 1700098 [woman] What is your problem?
1703401 1704402 Yo!
1711476 1714045 [dance music continues on speakers]
1715413 1716848 [grunting]
1742407 1744943 Hey! Put the bat down, or I'll blow your head off!
1748079 1749781 [people screaming]
1752517 1754018 [grunting]
1755320 1756755 -[grunts] -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
1756821 1758923 Take it easy, sweetheart.
1758990 1761526 You looking for me?
1761593 1764129 I see you met the twins.
1764195 1767932 Boy, you're everything they say, ain't ya?
1768633 1770235 I guess we both are.
1772070 1774239 How you doing?
1774305 1776574 I'm Oz.
1776641 1778843 [people cheering]
1781079 1782480 [Batman] Who is she?
1782547 1785250 [muffled club music playing]
1785316 1787952 I really don't know, chief.
1788019 1790989 I might have been coming out at the same time,
1791055 1792157 but I wasn't rolling with them.
1792223 1794125 [footsteps approaching]
1805603 1806971 It's okay, baby.
1807038 1811042 Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite. Come on.
1836434 1838469 Thank you, honey.
1838536 1841139 -[music continues on speakers] -[people cheering]
1844175 1846044 Here you go, champ.
1846110 1848046 I wanna know who she is,
1848112 1849848 and what she has to do with this murder.
1849914 1851983 -Whose murder? -The mayor's.
1852050 1853351 Is that the mayor?
1853418 1855453 Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.
1856621 1857989 Don't make me hurt you.
1858056 1862060 You better watch it. You know my reputation?
1862126 1865296 Yeah, I do. Do you?
1866898 1868499 Look...
1869701 1873137 I'm just the proprietor, okay?
1873204 1875440 I mean, what people do here
1875506 1877642 ain't got nothing to do with me.
1885884 1887552 Tell you one thing.
1889487 1893691 Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.
1893758 1895093 Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
1895159 1896361 Maybe she knows.
1899564 1901399 What? Too soon?
1906170 1908373 [soft suspenseful music plays]
1910909 1914379 You let me know if there's anything else I can do.
1914445 1917181 -[train wheels squealing] -[sirens wailing nearby]
1922820 1924022 Taxi!
1926424 1927425 Taxi!
1940138 1942440 [suspenseful music playing]
1944275 1945977 [cellphone ringing]
1946044 1947045 Hey, it's me.
1947111 1948646 [indistinct talking on phone]
1948713 1950281 Baby, what's wrong?
1950348 1952717 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down. I can't...
1955086 1957088 On the news?
1957155 1960391 Okay. No. No, stay there. Wait for me, okay?
1960458 1962060 Wait for me, I'm on my way home.
1962126 1963461 [woman on phone crying]
1963528 1964796 Listen, baby,
1964862 1967532 we're gonna get the hell out of here, okay? I promise.
1967598 1971069 If we have to leave earlier, we'll leave tonight.
1971135 1972403 -[line disconnects] -Uh...
1974739 1976207 God damn it.

1997028 1999897 Don Mitchell, Jr. with a younger mystery woman.
1999964 2001432 In a shocking development,
2001499 2002800 the police believe the photos themselves...

2013945 2015713 [inaudible conversation]

2206370 2208739 Hey! Give me that.
2212210 2214812 [Batman] "Kosolov, Annika."
2214879 2215980 [panting]
2216047 2218316 He hurt her? That's why you killed him?
2218382 2221152 What? Oh, please. Just give me the goddamn...
2221219 2222853 [muffled grunting]

2259457 2261959 Listen, honey, you got the wrong idea, okay?
2262026 2264562 I didn't kill anybody. I'm here for my friend.
2264629 2265997 She's trying to get the hell out of here,
2266063 2268099 and this son of a bitch stole her passport.
2268165 2269467 What does she know?
2269533 2270501 Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
2270568 2271836 she won't even tell me.
2271902 2273471 She did seem upset.
2275106 2276707 Back at your place.
2278542 2280344 Let's go talk to her.
2285583 2287318 [engines roaring]
2296594 2298596 [muffled tv chatter]
2306270 2307538 Anni!
2308773 2309840 Baby!
2311309 2312576 Anni!
2316414 2318382 Anni!
2319984 2321552 [weatherwoman] It's gonna be cool this evening.
2321619 2324088 It's gonna be down into the 40s.
2324155 2325990 [newscaster] More breaking news this hour,
2326057 2329660 as the city is rocked by a second high-profile murder
2329727 2331195 in as many nights.
2331262 2332496 And this time, the killer has come forward
2332563 2333731 to claim credit online...
2333798 2335199 Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
2335266 2336667 She's just a kid.
2337301 2338903 [sighs]
2338969 2340471 -Shit, they took my phone. -[newscaster 2] His victim,
2340538 2341539 longtime head of the Gotham City PD,
2341605 2342940 Commissioner Pete Savage,
2343007 2345109 was found dead earlier tonight
2345176 2347178 inside the Police Athletic League facilities
2347244 2348679 in the Tricorner area.
2348746 2351015 The killer posted the following message
2351082 2352750 on social media,
2352817 2354785 and we have to warn you, the video is very disturbing.
2354852 2357555 [deep and heavy breathing on TV]
2359924 2362693 [distorted male voice] Hello, people of Gotham.
2362760 2364929 This is the Riddler speaking.
2366330 2368032 On Halloween night,
2368099 2369500 I killed your mayor
2369567 2373070 because he was not who he pretended to be.
2373137 2375673 But I am not done.
2375740 2378075 [muffled whimpering on TV]
2378142 2380277 Here is another...
2380344 2381946 [whimpering]
2383080 2384615 [rattling]
2384682 2387418 ...who will soon be losing face.
2387485 2388886 [Pete whimpers]
2388953 2393157 I will kill again, and again, and again
2393224 2394925 until our day of judgment
2394992 2400731 when the truth about our city [raises voice] will finally
2400798 2403000 [in normal tone] be unmasked.
2404468 2406270 Goodbye!
2406337 2408706 [Pete panting and whimpering]
2410274 2411776 [newscaster] Commissioner Savage served
2411842 2414345 a distinguished 30-year career on the GCPD...
2414412 2416781 Holy shit, I seen that guy, too.
2418315 2419517 At the club.
2420584 2422119 The Iceberg Lounge?
2422920 2424488 44 Below.
2426223 2427224 What is that?
2430428 2432062 The club within the club.
2432863 2435065 [scoffs] The real club.
2437301 2439403 It's a mob hangout.
2439470 2441005 Is that where you work?
2441071 2442173 [cat meows]
2443274 2444475 Selina?
2449613 2451715 No, I just work the bar upstairs.
2454785 2456520 But I see 'em come in.
2456587 2458055 Who?
2458122 2459323 A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
2459390 2460858 I can tell you that.
2462460 2465196 Your basic upstanding citizen types.
2467398 2469033 You're gonna help me on this.
2469567 2471168 For your friend.
2472603 2474605 [cats meowing]
2481645 2483113 You got a lot of cats.
2484515 2486650 I have a thing about strays.
2487351 2489553 [gentle music playing]
2490554 2492022 You're not safe here.
2492923 2493991 I can take care of myself.
2494058 2495626 [newscaster] Two public figures
2495693 2497027 now dead in just the last two nights,
2497094 2498662 and only days before the election.
2498729 2499997 Police and city officials
2500064 2501932 are left searching for a killer
2501999 2505169 and hoping to find him before he kills again.
2522853 2527024 He waited for him at the gym.
2527091 2529360 Pete always liked to work out late at night,
2529426 2532530 when no one else was around.
2532596 2533931 There's a needle mark on his neck.
2533998 2536166 Injected him with arsenic.
2538168 2539637 Rat poison.
2540271 2541805 Yeah.
2541872 2544808 That seems to be his theme here.
2544875 2546343 Look at this thing.
2546410 2548612 [eerie music playing]
2554451 2556220 It's a maze.
2556287 2557288 [flashlight clicks]
2558722 2560424 What kind of demented son of a bitch
2560491 2562159 does this to a person?
2564762 2566030 [Batman] More symbols.
2568432 2569900 It's another cipher.
2569967 2573237 He blasted these out after his message went viral.
2573304 2575973 Bastard murders you and your reputation.
2576040 2579343 That guy pushes drops. On the east end.
2580811 2582313 I don't get it.
2582379 2584848 Why would Pete get involved in something like this?
2585583 2587551 Looks like he got greedy.
2587618 2589019 You kidding me?
2589086 2591488 After everything we did to take down the Maronis?
2591555 2592890 We busted their entire operation,
2592957 2594858 then he caves to some lowlife dealer?
2594925 2597194 Maybe he's not who you thought.
2598629 2600864 You make it sound like he had it coming.
2602866 2604635 He was a cop.
2605703 2607137 Crossed a line.
2626690 2627992 [flashlight clicks off]
2633797 2636000 [eerie music continues]
2638302 2639837 "I'm mad about you.
2639903 2643841 Want to know my name? Just look inside and see."
2650748 2653884 "Follow the maze until you find the rat.
2653951 2657621 Bring him into the light, and you'll find where I'm at."
2657688 2659990 The hell is that?
2660057 2663394 "Bring him into the light"? "Find the rat"?
2664495 2666096 I don't know.
2666797 2667931 [Martinez] Lieutenant.
2667998 2669333 They're coming back.
2669400 2671001 [Gordon] We got to get out of here.
2671068 2673270 [eerie music continues]
2675272 2676440 Come on.
2681578 2682780 [Selina] Ow.
2683981 2685349 I don't know about these things.
2685416 2689019 I need to see in there, this hunting ground.
2692690 2695759 Hey, why am I starting to feel like a fish on a hook?
2697461 2699029 I'm just looking for Annika.
2703033 2705769 Boy, you're a real sweetheart.
2705836 2707071 You really don't care what happens to me
2707137 2708472 in there tonight, do you?
2709873 2712076 [gentle music playing]
2717981 2719349 Look at me.
2728859 2731195 Looks good. Here.
2736934 2738435 [sighs]

2774104 2776306 I got you. Can you hear me?
2777274 2778275 Yeah.
2786784 2788418 Hey, where you goin'?
2788485 2790120 Hospitality.
2790187 2791522 [Batman] That's one of the guys
2791588 2793257 I got into it with the other night.
2794892 2796460 Looks like I broke his nose.
2796527 2797995 [door slides open]
2801064 2802966 [computer trilling]
2803033 2805102 "Kenzie, William."
2805169 2806937 He's an off-duty cop.
2808438 2810574 Are you sure no one can see these things in my eyes?
2810641 2812876 Don't worry. I'm watching you.
2813744 2816146 [sighs]
2816213 2818982 -[techno music playing] -[indistinct chatter]
2824388 2826290 [computer trilling rhythmically]
2829092 2832496 Don't look away. I need time to make IDs.
2832563 2833564 Great.
2840571 2841872 These guys have a little problem
2841939 2843106 with eye contact, don't they?
2843173 2844741 Feels good, doesn't it?
2844808 2847177 [man] Yeah, baby. Feels real good.
2853016 2854718 [Selina] Jesus, I hate dropheads.
2854785 2855819 [Batman] Really?
2855886 2857254 'Cause when I first saw you,
2857321 2858622 it looked like you were dealing for Penguin.
2858689 2859623 You don't know what you're talking about.
2859690 2860991 Can we not...
2861058 2863060 Can we not do this right now?
2864795 2866530 Wait. Who was that?
2866597 2867598 Oh, I saw him.
2867664 2869166 [Batman] Look back.
2869233 2870734 If I look back, it's gonna be a whole can of worms.
2870801 2872169 I need to see his face.
2873670 2875272 [sighs] Jesus.
2883080 2884414 That's the DA.
2884481 2885449 Gil Colson.
2885515 2887184 And he's coming over. You happy?
2887251 2888552 [Batman] Talk to him.
2891655 2892723 Hey. How you doing?
2892789 2894992 -Hi. -I'm Gil.
2895959 2898562 -Hey, aren't you the DA? -Yeah.
2898629 2900998 Wow. [chuckles] I've seen you on TV.
2901064 2902633 Is that right?
2902699 2906003 I haven't seen you around here before.
2906069 2908105 It's a hell of a time to be the new girl
2908171 2910574 'cause people are all a little on edge.
2910641 2912242 [Selina] Oh, honey, I live on the edge.
2912309 2913744 -[Gil] Is that right? -[Selina chuckles]
2913810 2915145 [Gil chuckles] I like that.
2915212 2916546 Do you want to come over?
2916613 2917614 Sure.
2920417 2921852 -[Gil] This is Travis. -Hey.
2921919 2923453 [Gil] You wanna take a seat over there?
2923520 2925622 -Richie, Glen. -[Richie] Hey.
2926990 2928392 That's half the DA's office.
2928458 2929893 [Gil] You know Carla here, huh?
2929960 2931662 -Hi. -That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
2931728 2932930 she's just taking a break.
2932996 2935098 Drowning our sorrows.
2935165 2936533 You want a drop?
2936600 2938702 [Selina] Uh, no, I'm good. But you enjoy.
2938769 2940604 [music continues on speakers]
2940671 2942105 Hope you don't mind.
2942172 2943407 I got a lot on my shoulders
2943473 2944775 with that psycho running around.
2944841 2945842 He's wasted.
2945909 2947411 No shit.
2947477 2949980 [chuckles] I like this girl.
2950047 2951682 Oh, hey, I like you, too!
2955118 2956787 I mean, this Riddler,
2956853 2958588 he's going after the most powerful people in the city.
2958655 2959723 He knows so much.
2959790 2961224 [Travis] He doesn't know shit, man.
2961291 2962526 [Gil] What are you talking about?
2962592 2964094 Yeah, he does! What about that rat...
2964161 2965595 [Richie] Hey, hey, Gil, come on.
2965662 2967331 -Hey. The rat. -[Richie] Think maybe you had
2967397 2968532 -a little too much. Slow down. -Ask him about the rat.
2970334 2972402 [Selina] Hey, what's this about a rat?
2975739 2977374 [inhales deeply]
2982679 2984448 I mean,
2984514 2988585 there was a rat. We had an informant.
2988652 2990988 We had big-time information on Salvatore Maroni.
2991054 2992990 That's how we got him out of the drops business.
2993056 2994524 He's talking about the Maroni case.
2994591 2998362 But if this guy knows, it's gonna come out.
2998428 2999796 And when it does,
2999863 3000998 this whole city's gonna come apart.
3001064 3002933 Okay, I don't wanna hear this.
3003000 3004401 This is the kind of pillow talk
3004468 3005802 that got that Russian girl disappeared.
3005869 3008405 What do you know about that?
3008472 3010907 -Does anybody want a drink? -[Gil] I want a drink.
3010974 3012376 Keep him talking.
3015045 3017614 -Wait, where are you going? -She knows Annika.
3017681 3019016 No, stay on the DA.
3019082 3021218 I told you I'm looking for my friend.
3022986 3024121 Where's Annika?
3024187 3025455 Out of my face. I don't know you.
3025522 3026690 Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?
3026757 3028325 What have you heard? Is she okay?
3028392 3029426 Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.
3029493 3030761 What, you got a death wish?
3030827 3032729 [man] Hey, what's the problem, ladies?
3032796 3035699 [Carla] There's no problem. It's just girl talk.
3035766 3037367 Let's keep it festive down here, all right?
3037434 3038702 [Carla] Sure thing, Oz.
3043507 3044541 Hey.
3045008 3047144 Hey.
3047210 3050547 Been a long time since I seen you down here.
3051782 3053150 How you been?
3055218 3057187 Yeah, I've been okay.
3058255 3059756 I was just, um...
3061591 3063627 I was just headed back upstairs.
3063693 3065462 Mm. Well,
3066329 3068265 don't be a stranger.
3081912 3084414 -You know Carmine Falcone. -I told you it's a mob spot.
3084481 3085916 You didn't tell me you had a relationship with him.
3085982 3088051 I don't have a relationship with him, okay?
3088118 3089453 Well, that's not what it looked like.
3089519 3091121 -Forget it. -Wait, what are you doing?
3091188 3092522 [line breaking up] Listen, I can't do this anymore.
3092589 3093523 No! No!
3093590 3095325 [static buzzes, stream stops]
3098195 3099196 [Selina] Taxi!
3099262 3101465 [heavy breathing]
3103166 3104367 [Gil] Hey!
3105936 3107003 I lost you in there.
3107070 3108338 Yeah, I gotta go.
3109039 3111074 Oh, you need a ride?
3111141 3112375 That's me right there.
3112442 3115145 [eerie music playing]
3118615 3119683 Taxi!
3119749 3120851 I'm good.
3122819 3124354 I hope, uh...
3128758 3130494 -I'll see you around. -[car door closes]
3134297 3136500 [eerie music continues]
3144841 3146276 [car alarm chirps]
3164861 3166429 [glass squeaking]
3166496 3168665 [eerie music continues]
3180277 3181878 [breathes deeply]
3181945 3182913 [Gil grunts]
3182979 3184981 [train rumbles past]
3187684 3190220 [car horn blaring continuously]
3196226 3197694 [car horn stops]
3201031 3203333 [Gil grunting weakly]
3213710 3216413 -[Gil grunts] -[Riddler shushes]
3216479 3220317 [Riddler] Just hold still.
3220383 3222652 -[beeping] -[Gil whimpers]
3222719 3225355 [Riddler breathing heavily and raspily]
3228391 3230594 [eerie music continues]
3236399 3238768 [wistful music playing]
3275605 3276906 [switch clicks]
3278675 3280610 [Batman] What do you know about a confidential informant
3280677 3282312 in the Maroni case?
3285448 3287717 Yeah, sure, there was.
3287784 3290520 That's the rat we're looking for.
3290587 3292889 Somehow Riddler knows who he is.
3292956 3296226 If we find the rat, maybe it'll lead us to him.
3296293 3297727 Where are you getting this?
3297794 3300730 I have a source who spoke to the DA tonight.
3301431 3303667 Gil's very nervous.
3303733 3306369 I think the killer's targeting people close to that case.
3306436 3308338 I worked that case.
3308405 3311608 -Riddler's not after you. -How do you know?
3311675 3313410 You're not corrupt.
3314244 3315879 Colson's dirty?
3321584 3323653 Maybe I, uh...
3323720 3327157 I go after him. Lean on him to give up the rat.
3327223 3328525 It's too dangerous.
3328591 3330994 They made a secret deal with this guy.
3331061 3332929 Who knows how many people it touches.
3332996 3337500 Politicians. Police. The courts.
3337567 3339602 It could tear the whole city apart.
3339669 3341905 [Gordon] Jesus, this is a powder keg.
3343406 3345842 [Batman] And Riddler's the match.
3345909 3347444 [Batman on video] You know Carmine Falcone.
3347510 3349245 [Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.
3349312 3350914 [Batman] You didn't tell me you had a relationship with him.
3350980 3351948 [Selina] I don't have a relationship...
3352015 3353550 [video rewinds]
3353616 3355318 [Batman] You didn't tell me you had a relationship with him.
3355385 3356519 [Selina] I don't have a relationship with him.
3356586 3357821 -Okay? -[video rewinds]
3357887 3359422 [Batman] You know Carmine Falcone.
3359489 3361224 [Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.
3361291 3363159 [Batman] You didn't tell me you had a relationship with him.
3363226 3364594 [Selina] I don't have a relationship with him. Okay?
3364661 3365695 -[Alfred] Pretty. -[tape clicks off]
3366663 3368865 She a new friend of yours?
3372602 3374571 I'm not so sure.
3374637 3377307 Looks like you upset her.
3377374 3379609 Shall I take this as a good sign?
3379676 3381644 -What? -Your attire.
3381711 3383713 Is Bruce Wayne making an actual appearance?
3383780 3385782 There's a public memorial for Mayor Mitchell.
3385849 3389552 Serial killers like to follow reactions to their crimes.
3389619 3391287 Riddler might not be able to resist.
3391354 3393790 Oh, that reminds me.
3393857 3396526 I've taken the liberty of doing a little work
3396593 3398395 on this latest cipher.
3398461 3400130 The one from the rat maze.
3400196 3403666 I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,
3403733 3405602 but I'm fairly certain this translates to,
3405668 3409506 "You are El Rata Alada."
3409572 3411207 [Bruce] Rata Alada?
3411274 3412342 "Rat with wings"?
3412409 3413576 It's slang for "pigeon."
3413643 3415111 Does that mean anything to you?
3415178 3416479 Yeah.
3417647 3419082 A stool pigeon.
3419149 3421885 -Where are your cufflinks? -I couldn't find them.
3423052 3425021 Well, you can't go out like that.
3425088 3427123 Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.
3431060 3433029 You have to keep up appearances.
3433096 3435598 -You're still a Wayne. -[scoffs]
3435665 3438034 And what about you? Are you a Wayne?
3438835 3440870 Your father gave them to me.
3443440 3446209 [gentle music playing]
3446276 3450413 [protestors chanting] No more lies! No more lies!
3450480 3453683 No more lies! No more lies!
3453750 3457253 No more lies! No more lies!
3457320 3460690 No more lies! No more lies!
3460757 3463827 No more lies! No more lies!
3463893 3467630 No more lies! No more lies!
3467697 3469065 Mr. Wayne. All right.
3469132 3471468 All right, you're going straight down there.
3471534 3473536 [melancholy music playing]
3473603 3475872 [protestors continue chanting]
3483313 3484914 [reporter] Is that Bruce Wayne?
3484981 3487684 [reporters] Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!
3487750 3490086 -[reporters clamoring] -[camera shutters clicking]
3496726 3497927 [man] Hold it.
3499195 3500597 You good, fellas?
3501064 3502065 Good.
3504167 3505235 We're good, Mr. Falcone.
3516746 3518948 [melancholy music continues]
3523086 3524087 Sir?
3525054 3527257 [reporters continue clamoring]
3543506 3544807 [bodyguard] Hey!
3544874 3546843 Give us a wide berth here, would you, slick?
3547610 3549779 Hey, watch it, fellas.
3549846 3552282 You got the prince of the city there.
3555385 3557053 Some event, huh?
3557120 3558888 Brought out the one guy in the city
3558955 3560189 more reclusive than me.
3560256 3562792 Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.
3562859 3564294 Aren't you afraid someone'll take a shot at you?
3564360 3566763 Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?
3567463 3569399 Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?
3569465 3571167 Wow, is that right?
3571234 3573870 His father saved my life.
3573937 3577273 I got shot in the chest. Right here.
3578441 3579709 I couldn't go to no hospital,
3579776 3582011 so we showed up on his doorstep.
3582078 3585448 Operated right on the dining room table.
3585515 3588618 Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
3588685 3590920 up on the stairs looking down.
3592255 3594257 I remember your face.
3596059 3598261 You don't think that meant something, he did that?
3598328 3600830 It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.
3601898 3603766 "Hippocratic oath."
3606202 3607737 That's good.
3607804 3609138 Excuse me.
3610139 3611841 [laughs]
3612575 3613576 Yes.
3613643 3615912 [Ave Maria playing]
3617814 3619782 [indistinct radio chatter]
3621851 3624887 -[heavy breathing] -[man coughing]
3627490 3629192 [announcer on mic] Ladies and gentlemen,
3629258 3630827 thank you all for coming to today's memorial
3630893 3632762 for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.
3632829 3634697 Our program will begin shortly.
3634764 3636299 As a reminder, the family asked
3636366 3637867 that those wishing to honor the mayor's memory
3637934 3639402 consider a donation to the cause
3639469 3641471 -most dear to his heart... -[scuffling]
3641537 3643573 ...the Gotham Renewal Fund,
3643640 3645108 our city's safety net.
3645174 3648811 What good's a safety net doesn't catch anybody?
3648878 3651381 Didn't help my daughter when she needed it,
3651447 3652782 I can tell you that.
3652849 3656119 The guy was just another rich scum-sucker.
3656919 3659022 He got what he deserved.
3660723 3661924 Know what I mean?
3662959 3665261 Hey, don't I know you?
3665328 3667063 [woman] Bruce Wayne.
3667130 3669298 Why haven't you called me back?
3669365 3670433 I'm sorry?
3670500 3672935 I'm Bella Real. I'm running for mayor.
3673002 3674470 I wouldn't be bothering you here,
3674537 3676906 but your people keep telling me you're unavailable.
3676973 3678441 Will you walk with me?
3680309 3682445 [Ave Maria continues playing]
3683579 3684847 Mr. Wayne.
3684914 3686582 Mr. Wayne.
3686649 3690319 You know, you really could be doing more for this city.
3690386 3692155 Your family has a history of philanthropy,
3692221 3694857 but as far as I can tell, you're not doing anything.
3694924 3698094 If I'm elected, I want to change that.
3698161 3699395 Thank you.
3700296 3701297 [Bella] My God.
3702732 3705535 I'm gonna go pay my respects. Will you wait for me?
3705601 3707236 I want to continue this.
3711374 3712375 Excuse me.
3714210 3716312 I'm so sorry for your loss.
3718414 3719582 Thank you.
3719649 3721284 [Gordon] Excuse me, chief. Can I talk to you?
3722552 3724454 Gil Colson is missing.
3724520 3725755 [Mackenzie] What?
3725822 3728257 He hasn't been heard from since last night.
3728324 3729358 Christ, not again.
3729425 3731494 Hey. Mr. Wayne.
3733529 3736232 You got people looking for him, Jim?
3736299 3738668 [Gordon] Sent a couple guys to his house. Nothing.
3738735 3739969 [Mackenzie] What'd his wife say?
3740036 3741170 [Gordon] She hadn't heard from him.
3742538 3744874 [people outside screaming]
3744941 3746542 [indistinct shouting]
3748644 3750146 [tires squeal]
3750780 3752215 [loud bang]
3758387 3760289 [tires screeching]
3760356 3763459 -[engine revving] -[people shrieking]
3765128 3767830 [suspenseful music builds up]
3770900 3773202 [tires screeching]
3778608 3780476 [people clamoring]
3780543 3783212 [menacing music playing]
3795925 3797360 [Gordon] Get out of the car!
3797426 3799996 Get out of the car and show your hands!
3801464 3802598 Get out!
3811574 3812675 [man in car grunting]
3812742 3813976 Get 'em up!
3814043 3815845 Get out! Show 'em!
3815912 3817513 [panting]
3820216 3821884 Christ, it's Colson.
3821951 3823486 [officer] There's a bomb around his neck!
3826989 3829225 -[cellphone ringing] -[people gasp]
3829292 3833329 -[whimpering] -[cellphone continues ringing]
3838968 3840469 Let's clear this place out now!
3840536 3842205 [officer 2] We've got to get this place cleared out!
3842271 3844574 -[people clamoring] -[cellphone continues ringing]
3856152 3858187 [cellphone ringing]
3868831 3870933 [whirring]
3872702 3875071 -[ringing continues] -[camera shutter click]
3876405 3879008 [man] Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.
3879075 3882144 [sirens wailing]
3882211 3883946 [officer] We don't know if he's in on it.
3886849 3888084 What's he looking at?
3888150 3890653 [cellphone ringing]
3890720 3892922 [distant footsteps]
3895291 3898060 [footsteps coming closer]
3898127 3900463 [ominous music playing]
3906903 3909138 Holy shit.
3909205 3910940 [Mackenzie] Are you kidding me?
3911007 3914410 What the hell is he doing? Gordon!
3914477 3917246 Your guy's gonna get himself killed in there.
3923119 3925321 [cellphone continues ringing]
3932862 3934096 Please.
3934163 3937233 He made me do it. [tearfully] I'm so sorry.
3937300 3938534 He told me if I didn't do
3938601 3939669 exactly what he said, he'd kill me.
3939735 3941037 I'm so sorry.
3941103 3942838 Looks like a combination lock.
3942905 3945007 Can't we just cut it off?
3945074 3947009 Not if you want to keep your head.
3950479 3952548 [cellphone continues ringing]
3977373 3979442 [Riddler breathing heavily]
3983346 3984747 [Riddler] You came.
3986615 3988050 Who are you?
3988117 3989318 Me?
3991654 3993322 I'm nobody.
3994690 3997026 I'm just an instrument,
3997093 3998728 here to unmask the truth
3998794 4001530 about this cesspool we call a city.
4001964 4003032 "Unmask"?
4003099 4005034 Yes.
4005101 4007970 Let's do it together, okay?
4008037 4011040 I've been trying to reach you.
4011107 4013676 You're part of this, too.
4013743 4015578 How am I a part of this?
4015644 4017279 You'll see.
4017346 4018948 [officer] Hey, Chief. You better take a look at this.
4019015 4021283 [Riddler on stream] Say hello to my followers.
4021350 4022785 We're live.
4022852 4025654 They're here to watch our little trial.
4026889 4028190 At the moment,
4028257 4031694 the man across from you, Mr. Colson,
4031761 4032995 is dead.
4033062 4034630 Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
4034697 4035965 -This psycho's gonna kill me! -But wait a minute...
4036032 4037433 [shouting] Shut up!
4037500 4039035 You deserve to be dead after what you did!
4039101 4042104 You hear me?
4042171 4043906 [softly] Okay.
4043973 4046709 [Riddler groaning comically]
4047843 4049378 [Riddler laughing]
4051781 4054250 [Riddler] I'm giving you a chance.
4055651 4058187 No one ever gave me a chance.
4060022 4061991 Now,
4062058 4064660 ever since I was a child,
4064727 4068998 I've always loved little puzzles.
4069065 4071400 For me, they are a retreat
4071467 4074937 from the horrors of our world.
4075004 4077239 Maybe they can bring
4077306 4079975 some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.
4080042 4082445 -You want me to do puzzles? -[chuckles excitedly]
4082511 4085314 Three riddles in two minutes.
4085381 4086949 You give me the answers,
4087016 4089452 and I'll give you the code for the lock.
4089518 4091987 -Do you understand? -Yeah.
4092054 4094190 Okay, okay. So I just...
4094256 4095691 -You want me to... -[device beeps]
4095758 4097626 -[whimpers] -Riddle number one...
4097693 4099428 -[timer beeping] -"It can be cruel,
4099495 4101464 poetic, or blind,
4101530 4106268 "but when it's denied, it's violence you may find."
4106335 4108838 Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?
4108904 4109972 "Cruel"? "Poetic"?
4110039 4111373 -"Justice." -Huh?
4111440 4112508 The answer's "justice."
4112575 4114009 -Justice? -Yes!
4114076 4115478 -Oh, God. -Justice!
4115544 4118214 [dramatically] And you were supposed to be
4118280 4119882 an arm of justice in this city,
4119949 4122451 along with the late mayor and police commissioner,
4122518 4124920 were you not, Mr. Colson?
4124987 4126355 Of course, of course.
4126422 4128524 - Of course. -Riddle number two.
4128591 4132695 "If you are justice, please do not lie.
4132761 4137099 "What is the price for your blind eye?"
4137166 4139001 -"The price"? -[Batman] "Bribes."
4139068 4140269 Oh, God. "Bribes"?
4140336 4141403 He's asking you how much it cost
4141470 4142671 for you to turn your back.
4142738 4143739 [hesitating]
4143806 4145107 [shouting] Fifty-eight seconds!
4145174 4146642 -How much? -Nothing!
4146709 4148844 -[raises voice] How much? -Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.
4148911 4150146 I get a monthly payment
4150212 4151447 just not to prosecute certain cases.
4151514 4152815 -What cases? -He didn't ask me that!
4152882 4154550 -Come on! Ten grand. -[Riddler laughing]
4154617 4156118 That's my answer. It's ten grand!
4156185 4157586 Okay. Okay. Okay.
4157653 4160156 Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.
4160222 4164293 Just one more to go before your time runs out.
4164360 4166695 [singsongy] Last riddle.
4166762 4171033 [dramatically] "Since your justice is so select,
4171100 4175538 please tell us which vermin you're paid to protect."
4175604 4177673 -"Which vermin"? -[Batman] The rat.
4177740 4179074 The informant you all protect
4179141 4180476 from the Salvatore Maroni case.
4180543 4182278 -How do you know about that? -What's his name?
4182344 4183979 -Twenty seconds. -No.
4184046 4185848 -He's gonna kill you. -I'm a dead man either way.
4185915 4187349 You're talking to a dead man, okay?
4187416 4189051 If I go out this way, it's just me.
4189118 4192288 But if I give over that name, I have family, people I love.
4192354 4193622 -He'll kill them, too. -Who will?
4193689 4195124 -People are watching. -What people?
4195191 4197259 It's so much bigger than you could ever imagine.
4197326 4198527 It's the whole system!
4198594 4200496 -Five! Four! -[beeping rapidly]
4200563 4202064 -Oh, God, have mercy on me... -Three!
4202131 4203999 -Goodbye! -[device trills]
4204066 4205301 [Batman grunts]
4207403 4209004 [people gasp]
4210472 4212675 [ears ringing]
4214076 4216278 [muffled, indistinct shouting]
4227356 4229391 [ringing intensifies]
4231293 4232561 [ringing stops]
4234563 4235931 [Martinez] Who do you think he is under there?
4235998 4237666 [Gordon] Take it easy. [Martinez] I want to see.
4238801 4240035 [medic] What is that thing? Leather?
4243772 4245374 [medic 2] What's he got on his eyes?
4245441 4246875 [Martinez] Who cares? I want to see his face.
4246942 4248377 -We are we doing here? -Let's just take it off...
4248444 4249945 -[Gordon] Hey! -[officers clamoring]
4250012 4252047 Hey! Hey! Hey!
4252114 4253115 Hey! Hey!
4253182 4254717 Relax, God damn it!
4254783 4256585 You're protecting this guy, Jim?
4257953 4260689 He interfered in an active hostage situation.
4260756 4263292 Colson's blood is on his hands.
4263359 4264793 Maybe it's on yours.
4266161 4267196 What'd you say?
4267263 4269331 He would rather die than talk.
4269398 4271000 What was he afraid of?
4271800 4273102 You?
4273168 4275337 [menacing music playing]
4279942 4281677 You son of a bitch.
4281744 4284747 You have any idea what kind of trouble you're in?
4284813 4286515 You could be an accessory to murder.
4286582 4287616 [officer] Why are we playing games...
4287683 4289618 [officers clamoring]
4289685 4290886 [officer 2] Get him! Come on!
4290953 4292721 Back off! Back off!
4292788 4295224 Great, now I got you on assaulting an officer!
4295291 4296358 You got me on assaulting three.
4296425 4298027 Hey!
4298093 4300462 What's the matter with you? This isn't the way to do this!
4301263 4302931 [breathes heavily]
4302998 4304233 You too now?
4304300 4306935 Let me handle this, Chief. Just give me a minute.
4307002 4308537 You're gonna put yourself on the line
4308604 4310039 for this scumbag, Jim?
4310105 4312341 Just give me a minute. I'll get him to cooperate.
4314977 4316545 Okay, give him the room.
4332061 4333495 Two minutes.
4345107 4346775 You listen to me.
4348043 4350446 [softly] We gotta get you out of here.
4351780 4353749 [softly] That would put a lot of heat on you.
4353816 4355751 Well, you punched me in the face.
4356685 4357853 [Batman scoffs]
4357920 4359154 Take this key.
4360389 4361724 Through that door.
4361790 4364660 Hallway to the stairs that go to the roof.
4364727 4367429 [Kenzie] Hey, what the hell is going on here?
4367496 4369732 Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?
4369798 4372968 [suspenseful music playing]
4373035 4375738 Who's the mustache with the broken nose?
4379074 4381643 That's Kenzie. Narcotics.
4381710 4383412 He's one of the guys I got into it with
4383479 4384847 at the Iceberg Lounge.
4385514 4386582 What are you saying?
4386648 4388484 Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?
4390853 4393021 Or he moonlights as a cop.
4397493 4398861 -[officer] Jesus Christ! -[Kenzie] Go!
4398927 4400496 [officer 2] Somebody stop him!
4400562 4402664 [officers clamoring]
4421350 4423919 [tense music playing]
4427823 4429191 [gasping]
4431226 4432227 [grunts]
4438700 4440502 -[officer 1] There he is! -[officer 2] Freeze!
4442771 4445240 [heroic music playing]
4459321 4460689 [grunting]
4465394 4467129 [groaning]
4486381 4488717 [Gordon] Could have at least pulled that punch, man.
4489151 4490319 I did.
4490385 4491954 Bock put out an APB on you.
4492020 4493689 You really think he's in on this?
4493755 4495991 I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?
4496058 4497459 I only trust you.
4497526 4499495 What's a narcotics cop doing with Falcone's right-hand man?
4499561 4501663 Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
4501730 4503565 Maybe Kenzie's part of it.
4503632 4504867 You think Penguin's the rat?
4504933 4506468 His club caters to the mob.
4506535 4507970 Maroni practically lived there.
4508036 4510105 Penguin would have been privy to a lot of dirt.
4510172 4511240 DA was a regular, too.
4511306 4513108 Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
4513175 4515911 and working a deal was his only way out.
4515978 4518447 -The Rata Alada. -The what?
4518514 4519882 Riddler's latest.
4519948 4521450 The cipher in the maze.
4521517 4524286 It means "a rat with wings." Like a stool pigeon.
4525754 4527656 A penguin's got wings, too.
4529258 4531226 Time for me to have another conversation with him.
4531293 4533228 What about the Riddler? He's gonna kill again.
4533295 4534496 It's all connected.
4534563 4536331 Like it or not, it's his game now.
4536398 4539635 You want to find Riddler, we gotta find that rat.
4539701 4542004 [thunder rumbling]
4542070 4543338 [Gordon on radio] Kenzie and the twins,
4543405 4544673 coming your way.
4545374 4546675 [Batman] There's Penguin.
4546742 4548610 [Gordon] I wonder what's in the bags.
4549912 4551313 You want to move in?
4553015 4554550 [Batman] Let's follow.
4554616 4556885 [suspenseful music playing]
4563158 4564293 [car horn honking]
4572968 4574670 They stopped at Waterfront Street.
4574736 4576638 The recycling plant.
4576705 4579174 [Batman] I'm here.
4579241 4581176 -[Penguin] How you doing? -[man] Yeah, good. How are you?
4581243 4582210 [Penguin] Good, good.
4582277 4584846 Let's get in out of this deluge.
4584913 4587015 [conversation continues indistinctly]
4590919 4593255 [suspenseful music continues]
4602831 4605467 It's a drug lab. Drops.
4605534 4606802 This is a buy.
4606868 4608403 Looks like they got Maroni's operation
4608470 4609871 up and running again.
4609938 4610973 Or they never shut it down at all.
4611039 4612541 [Gordon] What are you saying?
4612608 4615844 The biggest drug bust in GCPD history was a fraud?
4615911 4617746 [motorcycle approaching]
4620015 4622384 [suspenseful music continues]
4640135 4642237 This just got complicated.
4642304 4643438 What do you mean?
4647709 4649444 [twin 1 grunts]
4649511 4651179 Hey! What happened?
4651246 4652414 You all right?
4653615 4654816 [grunts]
4662924 4664660 Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.
4664726 4667162 [sighs] Jesus.
4667229 4669631 Is this how you get your kicks, hon?
4669698 4670966 Sneaking up on girls in the dark?
4671033 4673535 Is that why you work in the club?
4673602 4674903 It was all just a score?
4674970 4676605 You know, I would love to sit and go over
4676672 4678640 every gory detail with you, bat boy,
4678707 4681843 but, uh, those assholes are coming back.
4686815 4688216 -[gunfire] -[gasps]
4692988 4695090 -Jesus! -[engine revs]
4696425 4698794 -[engine revving] -[tires screeching]
4708570 4710205 [panting]
4717646 4720148 [dramatic music playing]
4722651 4723952 Hey, Vengeance!
4725887 4728857 You think you can come after my money, huh?
4740102 4742170 [engine powering up]
4748543 4750378 [thruster fires]
4752614 4754449 [engine revving]
4760822 4763024 [engine continues revving]
4766862 4768063 [tires screech]
4769531 4771032 Kenzie! Get the money!
4771099 4773835 [tense music playing]
4776538 4777939 Hey! What the...

5106901 5109571 -Who's the Riddler? -Riddler? How should I know?
5109637 5111106 [Gordon] Let's make it easy for you, Oz.
5111172 5112540 Cops caught you doing something.
5112607 5114275 They were gonna shut you down, put you away.
5114342 5116177 So you gave up a bigger fish to save your ass.
5116244 5118313 You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.
5118379 5119714 His drops operation.
5119781 5121116 [Gordon] But the cops, the city officials,
5121182 5122183 the mayor, the DA,
5122250 5123485 they got greedy, right?
5123551 5125753 Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.
5125820 5127622 They wanted to take over the drops business too,
5127689 5130158 but they needed a minor league mope like you to run it.
5130225 5132360 You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
5132427 5133695 You work for them, too.
5133761 5134762 What are you, crazy?
5134829 5135930 [Gordon] That why you killed the girl?
5135997 5137265 I didn't kill no girl!
5137332 5138933 We know she worked for you at the 44 Below.
5139000 5140135 But she got too close, right?
5140201 5141503 Found out from Mitchell
5141569 5142804 that you were the rat, so you killed her.
5142871 5144339 But somehow Riddler found out, too.
5144405 5146407 He knows so much about you.
5146474 5149110 -You must know about him. -Who is he?
5149177 5151613 Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.
5151679 5153481 Why don't you start harmonizing?
5153548 5156017 There's only one problem with your little scenario, okay?
5156084 5157585 I ain't no rat!
5157652 5159354 You got any idea what Carmine Falcone would do to me
5159420 5160588 if he heard this kind of talk?
5160655 5162557 Oh, you don't wanna talk about rats, huh?
5162624 5163858 Maybe we can talk about
5163925 5165326 what they did to my partner's face.
5165393 5166794 Holy God, what are you showing me here?
5166861 5168796 -This was around his head! -Come on!
5168863 5170798 [yells] Open your eyes!
5174536 5176304 Are you El Rata Alada?
5176371 5177672 El Rata Alada?
5177739 5179107 [Gordon] Yeah, a "rat with wings."
5179174 5180542 A stool pigeon. That's not you?
5180608 5182143 The symbols in the maze, right here.
5182210 5184746 It says you are El Rata Alada.
5184812 5186247 "You are El Rata"? It says that?
5186314 5187649 Why, you got something to tell us?
5187715 5188883 Yeah!
5188950 5190485 It's, like, the worst Spanish I ever heard.
5190552 5192921 -What? -It's "La."
5192987 5194556 "La" rata.
5194622 5196824 What, is this Riddler stupid or something?
5196891 5199060 Jesus! Look at you two.
5199127 5201596 World's greatest detectives!
5201663 5203064 Am I the only here knows the difference
5203131 5204432 between "el" and "la"?
5204499 5206701 Jesus! No habla espanol, fellas?
5206768 5208970 Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!
5210338 5211472 You think he made a mistake?
5211539 5212607 He doesn't made mistakes.
5212674 5213942 [Penguin] A rat with wings?
5214008 5215577 You know what that sounds like to me?
5215643 5218846 A friggin' bat! Huh? You ever think of that?
5218913 5220915 "You are El Rata."
5226588 5228089 "You"...
5228156 5229224 "are"...
5229290 5230491 "El."
5238833 5241336 Maybe it was a mistake. Maybe he isn't as smart as...
5241402 5242704 -[computer beeps] -Wait.
5246107 5248209 Is that him?
5248276 5250645 -[beeps] -Holy shit.
5250712 5251713 [typing]
5269831 5271699 What the hell does that mean? Is he or isn't he?
5300828 5304499 "I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed...
5304565 5307435 But in a mansion, in a slum...
5307502 5310271 I'll never know where I come from.
5310338 5311806 Do you know what I am?"
5311873 5312874 Any idea?
5313308 5314509 Yeah.
5315643 5317045 It's an orphan.
5325953 5327755 A mansion in a slum.
5329057 5330558 He's talking about the old orphanage.
5330625 5331759 The one that burned down?
5331826 5334162 It was part of the Wayne estate.
5334228 5336664 They donated it after they built the tower.
5336731 5337765 Let's go.
5339801 5342570 You guys realize I'm still here, right?
5343471 5344872 You gonna untie me?
5344939 5346507 How the hell am I supposed to get out of here?
5347241 5348776 [engine revs]

5438032 5440635 [man on recording] Thank you. Thank you so much.
5440701 5442036 Wasn't that beautiful?
5444639 5446941 Thank you all. Thank you, uh...
5447008 5448876 Thank you for coming today.
5450478 5452146 I believe in Gotham.
5453381 5456117 I believe in its promise.
5456184 5460388 But too many have been left behind for too long,
5460455 5462056 and that's why I'm here today.
5462123 5464959 To announce, not only my candidacy for mayor,
5465026 5469063 but also the creation of the Gotham Renewal Fund.
5469130 5470665 Win or lose,
5470731 5474001 the Wayne Foundation pledges a one billion dollar donation
5474068 5477305 to start a charitable endowment for public works.
5477371 5479140 I want to bypass political gridlock,
5479207 5481476 and get money to people and projects
5481542 5483644 who need it now,
5483711 5485346 like these children behind me.
5485413 5487014 "Sins of the father."
5487081 5490818 Renewal is about growth. It is about planting seeds
5490885 5493955 and renewing Gotham's promise.
5494021 5496023 [applause]
5497658 5500061 Shall be visited upon the son.
5501829 5505132 Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

5573234 5575102 -Oh, Mr. Wayne... -Listen to me!
5575169 5577638 Something terrible is gonna happen!
5577705 5580975 I'm afraid it already has, sir.
5581042 5584211 [Requiem: In Paradisum continues playing]
5591218 5593220 [voice quivering] About an hour ago.
5594355 5596090 I'm so sorry.
5597592 5599393 I've been trying to reach you.
5601963 5604131 [detective] The package was intended for you.
5604198 5606601 It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
5606667 5608202 We found this too.
5622383 5624385 [EKG machine beeping]
5630758 5632259 We've sedated him.
5632326 5634862 We just have to hope he stabilizes.
5634929 5638032 You should go home, Mr. Wayne. Get some sleep.
5638099 5640101 Is there anyone else to notify?
5641369 5642837 Next of kin?
5648009 5649076 No.

5766660 5769396 -Yeah, I can see you. -I need to talk to you.
5770131 5771398 Where can we go?

5793754 5795055 Wasn't sure I'd see you again.
5795122 5796157 Yeah, well, things were getting
5796223 5798559 a little hot for me, so...
5798626 5800227 How could they do that to her?
5800294 5802463 That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.
5802530 5804265 Her body was in his car.
5804331 5806367 I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna make him pay.
5806433 5808235 -You gonna help me? -Help you?
5808302 5810271 Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."
5810337 5811972 Your friend got involved with the wrong people.
5812039 5813541 She didn't know any better.
5813607 5815075 Maybe you should have explained it to her.
5815142 5816877 What the hell is that supposed to mean?
5816944 5818445 It means your choices have consequences.
5818512 5820815 Jesus Christ. "Choices"?
5820881 5822049 You know, whoever the hell you are,
5822116 5823751 you obviously grew up rich.
5823818 5825786 -Was it worth it? -What?
5825853 5829223 Compromising yourself for money?
5829290 5833127 What did you have to do to set up that score?
5833194 5836730 How close did you have to get to Penguin? To Falcone?
5836797 5838365 You don't know what the hell you're talking about.
5838432 5840534 -Falcone owes me that money. -He owes you?
5840601 5842269 -Yeah, and a lot more. -Oh, really? Why's that?
5842336 5843604 You know what? I can't even talk to you.
5843671 5845072 No! I want to know
5845139 5846373 why a guy like Falcone would owe you anything.
5846440 5849043 [shouts] Because he's my father!
5857952 5860988 My mother worked at the 44 Below.
5862189 5863624 Just like Anni.
5865559 5868395 She used to take me there when I was a little girl.
5870464 5871932 To the club?
5872666 5873667 Yeah.
5876237 5879640 I hid out in the dressing room while she worked.
5879707 5882042 Used to see him there.
5882109 5884311 He scared the shit out of me.
5886080 5887314 And I could never understand
5887381 5889783 why he looked at me the way he did.
5889850 5894054 Then one night, my mother told me who he was.
5897224 5899693 When I was seven, my mother was murdered.
5900427 5902096 Strangled.
5902162 5903430 Never found out who.
5903497 5905933 Probably some creep from the club.
5907434 5909637 Anyway, social services came to take me away,
5909703 5912106 and he didn't say a thing.
5913774 5915609 Couldn't even look at me.
5919213 5921215 He owes me that money.
5922883 5924385 I'm sorry.
5925486 5926620 For what I said.
5927922 5929456 Ah, it's all right.
5930090 5931358 [chuckles dryly]
5932860 5935129 You assume the worst in people.
5935863 5937364 Which, well...
5939533 5941669 maybe we're not so different after all.
5946907 5948709 Who are you under there?
5954782 5956684 What are you hiding?
5958986 5961055 Are you just...
5962323 5964291 hideously scarred?
5966393 5967394 Yeah.
5968295 5969630 [chuckles lightly]
5974568 5976103 Listen to me.
5977471 5981308 If we don't stand up for Annika, no one will.
5981375 5983444 All anyone cares about in this place
5983510 5986613 are these white, privileged assholes.
5986680 5989883 The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.
5989950 5991185 Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.
5991251 5992586 I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
5992653 5994722 that psycho's right to go after these creeps.
5994788 5996090 I think you'd be on his side.
5996156 5997758 What do you mean, "Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?
5997825 5999593 What, do you live in a cave?
5999660 6002730 The Riddler's latest. It's all about the Waynes.
6002796 6006967 Listen, if I can find that dickbag Kenzie,
6007034 6008335 will you help me?
6009536 6010771 Please.
6013374 6015509 Come on, Vengeance.
6017678 6020147 Just don't make any moves without me, understand?
6020214 6021849 It's a little more dangerous than you know...
6021915 6024284 [romantic music playing]
6031759 6033394 I told you, baby.
6034995 6037664 I can take care of myself.
6048175 6051812 [Thomas] I'm Thomas Wayne, and I approve this message.
6051879 6054581 [triumphant music playing]
6059453 6060888 From a very young age,
6060954 6063123 my family, Martha's family, the Arkhams,
6063190 6064858 instilled in both of us
6064925 6067861 that giving back is not just an obligation,
6067928 6069997 it's a passion.
6070064 6073434 That is our family's legacy.
6073500 6075969 [Riddler on TV] The Waynes and the Arkhams.
6076036 6078405 Gotham's founding families.
6078472 6082776 But what is their real legacy?
6082843 6085946 Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
6086013 6087614 to uncover the dark truth.
6087681 6091919 He found shocking family secrets.
6091985 6093954 How, when Martha was just a child,
6094021 6096290 her mother brutally murdered her father,
6096356 6097758 then committed suicide...
6097825 6099493 -[gunshot] -...and how the Arkhams
6099560 6103764 used their power and money to cover it up.
6103831 6105632 How Martha herself
6105699 6108502 was in and out of institutions for years,
6108569 6111538 and they didn't want anyone to know.
6111605 6114007 Thomas Wayne tried to force this crusading reporter
6114074 6118579 into a hush-money agreement to save his mayoral campaign.
6118645 6120781 [raises voice] But when the reporter refused,
6120848 6123750 Wayne turned to longtime secret associate
6123817 6125085 Carmine Falcone,
6125152 6127688 [laughing hysterically] and had him murdered!
6127754 6131458 -[gunshot] -The Waynes and the Arkhams,
6131525 6137064 Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.
6137131 6139600 [in deep voice] I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.
6139666 6142336 This is your legacy too.
6142402 6145772 And Gotham needs you to answer
6145839 6148876 [whispering] for the sins of your father.
6150310 6152346 Goodbye.
6154448 6156884 [club music playing on speakers]
6157818 6158886 Do you know who I am?
6160387 6161488 You're Bruce Wayne.
6161555 6163657 I wanna see Carmine Falcone.
6174268 6175469 See?
6176103 6177504 [scoffs]
6177571 6178839 [elevator bell dings]
6178906 6181375 [romantic old song playing on speakers]
6185412 6186914 [billiard balls clatter]
6186980 6189917 [Falcone] Who is this guy who invented the ball, right?
6189983 6192386 Must have made a fortune.
6192452 6195589 If you think about it, the concept of it, right?
6195656 6198225 Briscoe, do you know how much this sweater cost?
6198292 6199293 [Briscoe] No, boss.
6199359 6202229 [Falcone] $1,183.
6202296 6204264 You know why communism failed, right?
6204331 6205532 [Briscoe] No, boss.
6207267 6208669 [Falcone] Austerity.
6208735 6210604 [men laugh]
6210671 6212339 [Penguin] All right. All right.
6212406 6214908 [Falcone chuckles] Look at that. Perfect.
6214975 6216977 [Penguin] It's never gonna be that good again.
6219146 6221548 Hey, Johnny Slick.
6221615 6222916 What are you doing here?
6224651 6226720 Give us a moment here, fellas.
6227454 6228689 [Penguin] Come on.
6230424 6231792 See ya, champ.
6232593 6233994 Come on, sweetheart.
6235963 6236964 Have a seat.
6238799 6241702 I thought I might hear from you.
6241768 6245272 This, uh, Riddler son of a bitch is really
6246506 6248342 stirring things up, huh?
6248408 6250377 -Is it true? -What?
6251411 6253313 That reporter business?
6254481 6255749 What do you want to know here, kid?
6255816 6258552 Did you kill him? For my father?
6258619 6262256 Look, your father was in trouble.
6262322 6264124 This reporter had some dirt.
6264191 6266760 Some very
6266827 6269529 personal stuff about your mother,
6269596 6270931 her family history.
6270998 6272499 You know, everybody's got their dirty laundry,
6272566 6273867 that's just how it is.
6273934 6275135 But he didn't want none of it coming out,
6275202 6277404 not right before the election.
6277471 6279606 And your father tried to pay the guy off,
6279673 6281675 but he wasn't going for it.
6281742 6283243 So...
6283310 6284678 he came to me.
6284745 6287447 Well, I never seen him like that.
6288115 6290550 He said, "Carmine,
6290617 6295589 "I want you to put the fear of God in this guy."
6297724 6300861 And when fear isn't enough...
6301428 6302996 Oof. Hmm.
6304531 6307968 Your father wanted me to handle it, so I did.
6308969 6310837 I handled it.
6312406 6313740 I know.
6313807 6316410 You thought your father was a Boy Scout.
6317411 6319279 But you'd be surprised
6319346 6321648 what even a good man like him
6321715 6324584 is capable of in the right situation.
6326586 6328355 Do me a favor.
6328422 6330657 Don't lose any sleep over it.
6331224 6332893 This reporter
6333560 6335228 was a lowlife.
6335295 6336863 He was on Maroni's payroll.
6338365 6340600 -Maroni? -Oh, yeah.
6340667 6344738 He could never stand your father and I had history.
6344805 6347107 And... And after what happened with that reporter,
6347174 6348775 Maroni was worried
6348842 6351511 that your father would be in my pocket
6352112 6353580 forever.
6353647 6355682 He would have done anything
6355749 6358085 to keep him from becoming mayor.
6358151 6359619 You understand?
6360587 6361922 Are you saying
6361988 6365225 Salvatore Maroni got my father killed?
6365292 6367527 Do I know it for a fact?
6369663 6371932 I'm just saying, it sure looked that way to me.
6373233 6375469 This is what you wanted, huh?
6375535 6378305 This little conversation here?
6378372 6380340 [exhales ruefully]
6380407 6382743 It's been a long time coming, huh?
6385045 6387547 I mean, you ain't a kid no more.
6390317 6392686 [melancholy music playing]
6436797 6438732 [EKG machine beeping]
6442135 6443737 [inhales sharply]
6449176 6450911 [rain pattering]
6453613 6454815 [sighs]
6457117 6458552 You lied to me...
6461221 6462923 my whole life.
6467861 6470096 I spoke to Carmine Falcone.
6472766 6476203 He told me what he did for my father.
6480307 6481908 About Salvatore Maroni.
6483610 6486379 He told you Salvatore Maroni...
6486446 6488248 Had my father killed.
6490617 6492986 Why didn't you tell me all this?
6495388 6500660 All these years I've spent fighting for him,
6500727 6503096 believing that he was a good man.
6503163 6505332 He was a good man.
6505398 6506967 You listen to me.
6507033 6510770 Your father was a good man.
6514274 6516409 -He made a mistake. -A "mistake."
6516476 6518411 He had a man killed.
6518478 6520680 Why?
6520747 6524084 [sighing] To protect his family image?
6524951 6526152 His political aspirations?
6526219 6527787 It wasn't to protect the family image,
6527854 6530056 and he didn't have anyone killed.
6532526 6534661 He was protecting your mother.
6534728 6538565 He didn't care about his image or the campaign, any of that.
6538632 6540934 He cared about her
6541001 6542269 and you,
6542335 6545005 and in a moment of weakness, he turned to Falcone.
6545071 6549476 But he never thought Falcone would kill that man.
6549543 6551044 Your father should have known
6551111 6552879 that Falcone would do anything
6552946 6556182 to finally have something on him that he could use.
6556249 6558051 That's who Falcone is.
6560120 6562589 And that was your father's mistake.
6562656 6564591 But when Falcone told him what he'd done,
6564658 6568094 your father was distraught.
6568161 6571531 He told Falcone he was going to the police,
6571598 6573934 that he would confess everything.
6575335 6577337 And that night,
6577404 6580173 your father and your mother
6580240 6581341 were killed.
6583376 6585679 [soft music playing]
6586713 6588682 It was Falcone?
6593386 6594487 [smacks lips]
6594554 6596823 Oh, I wish I knew for sure.
6601227 6604864 Or maybe it was some random thug on the street
6604931 6606499 who needed money, got scared,
6606566 6607834 and pulled the trigger too fast.
6607901 6610937 If you don't think I've spent every day
6611004 6613173 searching for that answer...
6614574 6619145 It was my job to protect them. Do you understand?
6619212 6621348 I know you always blamed yourself.
6621414 6623950 You were only a boy, Bruce.
6625885 6628288 I could see the fear in your eyes,
6629623 6631992 but I didn't know how to help.
6632058 6635829 I could teach you how to fight, [sighs]
6635895 6638632 but I wasn't equipped to take care of you.
6638698 6640767 You needed a father.
6642535 6645071 And all you had was me.
6647374 6648742 I'm sorry.
6650343 6652278 Don't be sorry, Alfred.
6659119 6660186 God.
6663023 6667694 I never thought I'd feel fear like that again.
6670096 6672365 I thought I'd mastered all that.
6678738 6680140 I mean,
6681107 6683410 I'm not afraid to die.
6685011 6687714 I realize now there's something
6688615 6690717 I haven't got past.
6691451 6693253 This fear...
6695422 6698792 of ever going through any of that again.
6702796 6705131 Of losing somebody I care about.
6723550 6725919 [soft music continues]
6733059 6735795 [soft dramatic music playing]
6740500 6742502 [engine revving]
6755648 6756783 Hey.
6756850 6759519 I saw the signal. That's not you?
6759586 6761421 I thought it was you.
6765592 6767093 [both grunting]
6774167 6775802 -I found him! -I see that.
6775869 6777337 He had my shit and my phone.
6777403 6779072 She left a message the night they took her.
6779139 6781541 -She called me... -Gordon! Help me out, man!
6781608 6783176 She got my gun!
6783243 6784277 [grunts]
6784344 6787247 -Shut up! -Put the gun down.
6787313 6790150 I'm telling you, God damn it! She called me!
6794354 6796856 -[cellphone beeps] -Here. Listen.
6798591 6800426 [Kenzie on recording] Hey! Get back here!
6800493 6801795 -[Annika whimpering] -Where you going?
6801861 6803429 Come back here!
6803496 6804764 [Falcone] Hey, hey, what are you doing, Kenzie?
6804831 6806166 You're scaring her.
6806232 6807901 [Kenzie] I'm... I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.
6807967 6809102 [Annika tearfully] Please, please, please.
6809169 6810637 Please, don't hurt me, please.
6810703 6813439 [Falcone] Hey, don't be scared. Come here.
6815175 6817811 Now let me ask you again.
6817877 6820513 -What did Mitchell tell you? -[Annika] No, nothing. He...
6820580 6823516 [Falcone] Don liked to talk. I know that.
6823583 6826719 Especially to pretty girls like you.
6826786 6829489 That's why I made him take your passport,
6829556 6832458 until we could have this little conversation.
6832525 6835295 [Annika] All I want to do is get out of here, okay?
6835361 6837063 You'll never hear from me again, nobody will.
6837130 6838731 Please, please...
6838798 6841601 [Falcone] We're gonna get you out of here, I promise.
6841668 6845104 But first, I gotta know...
6845171 6847207 -What did he tell you? -[Annika] He...
6847273 6851344 He just said they all made a deal with you.
6851411 6854714 [Falcone] Oh. Hmm. He told you about that, huh?
6854781 6856015 The deal.
6856082 6857617 [Annika] He said
6857684 6861020 you gave some information on some drops thing,
6861087 6863656 and that's how he became mayor.
6863723 6866426 He said you were a very important man.
6866492 6867594 [Falcone] Right.
6868361 6869629 Mm-hmm.
6870597 6872999 Hmm. Okay.
6874100 6877470 -[tussling on recording] -[Annika screams]
6877537 6880240 -[Annika cries] -[tussling continues]
6880306 6881774 -[Falcone] Just take it easy. -[Annika choking]
6881841 6883276 Jesus, he's strangling her.
6883343 6886579 [Falcone] Take it easy.
6888414 6889549 [recording stops]
6895755 6897190 Rata Alada.
6901995 6903830 A falcon has wings, too.
6903897 6905965 Falcone is the rat?
6916743 6920513 Falcone works for you guys?
6920580 6923216 The mayor? The DA?
6926052 6927720 No. [breathing shakily]
6930156 6931591 We work for him.
6932592 6933793 Everybody does.
6933860 6934928 How?
6934994 6937163 Through Renewal.
6937230 6938531 Renewal is everything.
6938598 6940667 -The Renewal Fund? -[Kenzie] Yeah.
6940733 6941968 After Thomas Wayne died,
6942035 6944370 they all went after it like vultures.
6944437 6948141 The mayor, Falcone, Maroni. Everyone got in on it.
6948207 6950476 It was perfect for making bribes,
6950543 6951644 laundering money.
6951711 6953680 A huge charitable fund with no oversight.
6953746 6955581 Everybody got a piece.
6955648 6957517 But Falcone wanted more.
6959319 6962655 So he orchestrated a play to take Maroni down big.
6963923 6966392 He'd rat out his drops operation,
6966459 6969295 make the careers of everybody that went after him,
6969362 6971664 then install them all as his puppets.
6971731 6974567 You think this goddamn election matters?
6976069 6978638 Falcone's the mayor.
6978705 6981307 He's been the mayor for the last 20 years.
6981374 6983376 Come on, Vengeance.
6983443 6986012 Let's go kill that son of a bitch.
6986079 6987513 This creep too. Let's finish this.
6987580 6988648 -Oh, God! -No!
6988715 6990016 [gun clatters]
6990083 6991718 We'll get him.
6991784 6993953 -But not that way. -There is no other way!
6994020 6997090 -He owns the city! -Cross that line,
6997156 6999092 you'll become just like him.
6999158 7000793 Listen to me.
7000860 7002762 Don't throw your life away.
7009168 7010670 Don't worry, honey.
7013740 7015074 I got nine of 'em.
7015141 7017377 -[screams] -[Gordon] No, don't! Hey, hey!
7018411 7020813 [Kenzie] Oh, God! [whimpering]
7029288 7030790 [Gordon] She won't get out of there alive.
7030857 7033126 And if she kills Falcone, we may never find the Riddler.
7033192 7035495 -I have to stop her. -Don't you mean "we"?
7036763 7038598 I gotta do this my way.
7038664 7039665 And then what?
7040366 7042468 We do what Riddler said.
7042535 7044437 Bring the rat into the light.
7047306 7049842 [dramatic music playing]
7052912 7054514 [engine roaring]
7080173 7082208 Can you tell Mr. Falcone I'd like to come up?
7082275 7084277 He ain't seein' nobody tonight.
7084343 7085812 Tell him it's about Annika.
7088981 7091050 Hey!
7091117 7092585 Look who it is, huh?
7092652 7094921 -Sorry to bother you. -Nah. It's fine, beautiful.
7094987 7097190 I was just hoping I could talk to you for a minute?
7097256 7098825 Absolutely.
7100626 7101627 Alone?
7101694 7102962 [banging on door]
7103029 7105398 [muffled club music playing]
7118144 7119312 Hey!
7119378 7121681 [club music playing on speakers]
7129555 7130723 [tearfully] I'm just so worried.
7130790 7132692 I... I don't know where she is.
7134293 7137663 And I know that you're a very important man.
7137730 7140700 I was hoping that maybe you could help me find her...
7140766 7142535 [inhales shakily]
7142602 7146405 because she's been gone so long, I'm beginning to...
7146472 7149075 -I'm sorry. [sniffling] -It's okay.
7149142 7151244 -I'm so sorry. -I understand. Here.
7151310 7154413 No, that's okay, I have a tissue.
7158417 7160253 -Mr. Falcone? -Vinnie!
7160319 7161954 -Didn't I tell you? -I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.
7162021 7164423 I really think you're gonna want to see this.
7166292 7167994 [Falcone] I'm sorry, beautiful.
7168060 7169462 I'll be right back.
7175468 7177837 [dramatic music playing]
7183309 7184644 [indistinct TV chatter]
7184710 7186012 Holy shit.
7186078 7187780 [newscaster] That recording, provided to GC-1
7187847 7190116 by Lieutenant James Gordon of the Gotham PD.
7190183 7191450 And we should warn you,
7191517 7192952 the contents are extremely graphic,
7193019 7195821 and some of you may find it disturbing.
7195888 7198024 [Annika tearfully] He just said
7198090 7200026 they all made a deal with you.
7200092 7201294 [Falcone] Oh. Hmm.
7201360 7203095 He told you about that, huh?
7203162 7204764 The deal.
7204830 7206165 [Annika] He said
7206232 7209569 you gave some information on some drops thing,
7209635 7212438 and that's how he became mayor.
7212505 7215141 He said you were a very important man.
7215208 7216409 [Falcone] Right.
7217176 7219679 Hmm. Okay.
7221380 7223449 -[tussling on recording] -[Annika screams]
7226719 7229355 [newscaster] Revelations of Mr. Falcone's secret role
7229422 7230690 as a mafia informant...
7231157 7232558 Hey, Dad.
7233726 7235027 What?
7235094 7237330 I'm Maria Kyle's kid.
7239065 7240633 You remember her?
7242101 7243336 Yeah.
7244770 7245771 Just...
7247640 7248908 Just put down the gun, honey.
7248975 7250042 This is for my mother.
7251410 7253479 -[power shuts down] -[people exclaim]

7331891 7333759 [both grunting]
7341000 7342501 [panting]
7346372 7347640 [Selina groans]
7352345 7354146 You don't think this hurts me?
7357883 7361053 -[Selina choking] -My own flesh and blood, huh?
7368060 7369261 [grunting]
7369328 7371097 [screaming]
7371163 7373232 [screams]
7373299 7375034 -[Selina choking] -[grunting]
7377370 7379405 You made me do this.
7380539 7382575 Just like your mother.
7383376 7384677 [Falcone grunts]
7388381 7389849 He has to pay!
7393586 7394854 You don't have to pay with him.
7394920 7396455 [Selina gasping]
7398391 7399992 You paid enough.
7403529 7405898 [soft music playing]
7416675 7417977 [Selina gasps]
7423616 7425985 [soft music continues]
7431924 7433759 [laughs]
7434427 7435728 Jesus.
7435795 7438297 Look at you, man. What do you think this is?
7438364 7439532 You think you're gonna scare me
7439598 7441300 with that mask and that cape?
7441367 7443669 I'm gonna start crying, and all of a sudden,
7443736 7445438 some big secret's comin' out?
7445504 7447206 Let me tell you something.
7447273 7449041 Whatever I know,
7449108 7450810 whatever I've done,
7450876 7453512 it's all going with me
7453579 7455548 to my grave.
7465758 7467927 What, are you with Zorro over here?
7469228 7471864 Don't you know you boys in blue work for me?
7479605 7481874 [Gordon] I guess we don't all work for you.
7481941 7483709 [indistinct radio chatter]
7490883 7493118 You have the right to remain silent.
7493185 7495521 Anything you say can and will be used against you
7495588 7496856 in a court of law.
7496922 7498390 You have the right to an attorney.
7498457 7499725 If you cannot afford one,
7499792 7501427 the City of Gotham will provide one to you.
7501494 7503262 Do you understand these rights?
7504630 7506298 Do you understand?
7508334 7509401 [Falcone] Yeah.
7509468 7511470 I'll see you when I walk out.
7511537 7512872 [Gordon] With these rights in mind,
7512938 7514039 is there anything else you wish to tell...
7514106 7515307 Goddamn rat.
7517343 7518544 What'd you say?
7518611 7520613 Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine.
7521514 7522748 Probably be your last.
7522815 7526151 Oh-ho! So you're a big man now, Oz, huh?
7526218 7527286 Maybe I am.
7527353 7528988 Really, Oz?
7529054 7533425 Because to me, you were always just a gimp in an empty suit.
7533492 7534693 I'll spray paint your ass!
7534760 7538497 -[gunshot] -[people clamoring]
7538564 7539932 What are you doing? It wasn't me!
7539999 7542201 I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!
7543469 7544837 Get your hands off of me!
7544904 7547306 -[sad music playing] -[breathes laboriously]
7552645 7555247 [exhales, stops breathing]
7555314 7557149 [lights crackling]
7564456 7566659 "Bring him into the light.
7569929 7572097 And you'll find where I'm at."
7572164 7573032 [Martinez] There!
7573098 7575167 The shots came from up there!
7575234 7576535 [officers clamoring]
7576602 7577603 It's Riddler.
7577670 7579538 [helicopter blades whirring]
7579605 7580773 [Gordon] Gage, on me.
7580839 7582041 Martinez, around back.
7582107 7583876 Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!
7603062 7604697 [panting]
7605831 7608367 [eerie music playing]
7643535 7645304 [dog barking]
7650009 7652211 [officers clamoring]
7658250 7659418 He's gone.
7669061 7670996 He's been here this whole time.
7671063 7673298 -Lieutenant. Martinez. -Yeah?
7673365 7674867 [Martinez] Lieutenant, we got a witness here,
7674933 7676268 says she saw someone coming down
7676335 7677870 the fire escape right after the shot.
7677936 7679738 She said he went into the corner diner.
7679805 7682941 The guy's sitting by himself at the counter, right now.
7683008 7685310 [tense music playing]
7695821 7697489 [indistinct TV chatter]
7697556 7698557 [door opens]
7698624 7700826 [officer] Police! Hands up!
7703462 7705631 [Gordon] He said put your goddamn hands up,
7705698 7707666 you son of a bitch.
7707733 7710069 [tense music continues]
7716608 7718477 [stool creaking]
7726151 7728287 I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.
7731056 7732491 [Martinez] Stay still!
7732558 7733759 Now!
7734660 7736361 [handcuffs clicking]
7744436 7746438 [tense music continues]
7762054 7763922 [Martinez] Which one is you?
7763989 7766358 [laughs gleefully] You tell me.
7766425 7767993 Let's go, pencil-neck.
7770863 7772664 Get that son of a bitch out of here!
7772731 7774933 [eerie music playing]
7784710 7787146 [siren wailing in distance]
7787212 7788447 [newscaster] ...where even murdered mayor
7788514 7790315 Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son
7790382 7793051 have gathered in an emotional show of city unity.
7793118 7794520 Our Dan O'Neil is live
7794586 7795687 inside Real's headquarters right now...
7795754 7796989 Hey.
7799758 7802060 [suspenseful music playing]
7821146 7822915 What are all these diaries?
7822981 7825317 They're ledgers. He's got thousands.
7825384 7828987 He scrawled all over 'em. Rambling, ciphers, codes.
7829054 7830622 Got something back on one of the IDs.
7830689 7832991 Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.
7833058 7834927 -He's a forensic accountant. -Accountant?
7834993 7837329 Hey, Lieutenant! You really okay with this?
7837396 7839398 What about chain of evidence?
7840065 7841433 You should see this.
7847206 7849007 He's wearing gloves.
7850175 7852377 "Friday, July 16th.
7852444 7856415 My life has been a cruel riddle I could not solve,
7856481 7859651 suffocating my mind, no escape.
7859718 7861353 But then, today, I saw it.
7861420 7865490 A single word on this ledger, sitting on the desk beside me.
7866758 7868360 'Renewal.'
7868427 7870662 The empty promise they sold to me
7870729 7873031 as a child in that orphanage.
7873098 7876134 One look inside, and finally I understood.
7876201 7879471 My whole life has been preparing me for this.
7879538 7882107 The moment when I would learn the truth.
7882174 7883942 When I could finally strike back
7884009 7886311 -and expose their lies." -[rats squeaking]
7886378 7890082 "If you want people to understand, really understand,
7890148 7892584 you can't just give them the answers.
7892651 7893986 You have to confront them,
7894052 7896622 torture them with the horrifying questions,
7896688 7898924 just like they tortured me.
7898991 7901927 I know now what I must become."
7904696 7905931 Jesus.
7905998 7907566 [bat screeching]
7912004 7914539 I don't think that rat likes you, man.
7914606 7915974 This one's not a rat.
7916041 7918377 -[rats continue squeaking] -[cages rattling]
7922881 7924683 [screeching violently]
7932724 7934026 [Gordon] What is that?
7936461 7938664 [bat screeching frantically]
7965290 7966725 [officer] Some kind of pry tool?
7966792 7968026 Is it a chisel?
7968093 7969661 [Batman] It's a murder weapon.
7969728 7971496 He killed Mitchell with it.
7971563 7973265 The edge will match the floorboard impression
7973332 7974599 in the mayor's study.
7983141 7985143 "My confession"?
7985210 7986478 What's he confessing to?
7986545 7988413 He already told us he killed Mitchell.
7988480 7989681 This isn't over.
7989748 7990983 [officer 2] Oh, man.
7991049 7992484 He's been posting all kinds of shit online.
7992551 7994953 He's got, like, 500 followers. Real fringe types.
7995020 7996355 [typing]
8002227 8004997 His final post was last night.
8005063 8006498 Some video.
8006565 8008233 Got a lot of views, but it's password-protected.
8008300 8009701 [Gordon] Can you get in?
8009768 8011436 [officer 2] Copying his drive now.
8011503 8014973 Take some time, but we'll get in.
8015040 8017275 [ominous music playing]
8026018 8028787 -[Gordon] Show me the post. -[officer 2] It's right here.
8030455 8032924 [Gordon] "The Truth Unmasked."
8032991 8034659 I think I'm his last target.
8037129 8038430 You?
8038497 8040732 Maybe this is all coming to an end.
8041166 8042968 What is?
8043035 8044336 The Batman.
8044403 8046204 [cellphone ringing]
8049875 8051209 Yeah?
8062454 8063622 Right.
8066324 8070495 Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.
8077836 8079438 You're a good cop.
8103728 8106765 [over speaker] I told you I'd see you in hell.
8106832 8108967 [Batman] What do you want from me?
8109034 8111002 [Riddler] "Want"?
8111069 8112471 If only you knew how long
8112537 8114773 I've been waiting for this day.
8115941 8118143 For this moment.
8118210 8122214 I've been invisible my whole life.
8122280 8125183 I guess I won't be anymore, will I?
8126418 8128954 They'll remember me now.
8129020 8130889 They'll remember both of us.
8141199 8143368 Bruce...
8146071 8147939 Wayne.
8150242 8154246 [slowly] Bruce...
8155580 8158483 Wayne.
8164089 8165590 [exhales deeply]
8169461 8172197 You know, I was there that day.
8174466 8176368 The day the great Thomas Wayne
8176434 8177969 announced he was running for mayor,
8178036 8180539 made all those promises.
8182707 8184442 Well, a week later he was dead,
8184509 8187546 and everybody just forgot about us.
8187612 8191283 All they could talk about was poor Bruce Wayne.
8191349 8195287 Bruce Wayne, the orphan.
8195754 8197389 Orphan.
8202827 8206198 Living in some tower over the park
8206264 8209100 isn't being an orphan.
8209167 8214539 Looking down on everyone, with all that money.
8214606 8216441 Don't you tell me.
8218743 8221913 Do you know what being an orphan is?
8221980 8225617 It's 30 kids to a room.
8225684 8228253 Twelve years old and already a drophead,
8228320 8229921 numbing the pain.
8231489 8232791 You wake up screaming
8232857 8237095 with rats chewing your fingers.
8237162 8240498 And every winter one of the babies die
8240565 8242968 because it's so cold.
8244202 8246871 But, oh, no.
8247872 8249541 [smacks lips]
8249608 8251543 Let's talk about the billionaire
8251610 8253111 with the lying, dead daddy,
8253178 8255947 because at least the money makes it go down easy.
8256014 8257015 Doesn't it?
8258383 8260619 Bruce...
8261653 8263588 Wayne.
8266925 8270395 He's the only one we didn't get.
8273531 8277936 But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?
8278003 8282307 All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.
8285210 8286544 God.
8287345 8288780 Look at you.
8290315 8292684 Your mask is amazing.
8292751 8295887 I wish you could've seen me in mine.
8295954 8297088 Ain't it funny?
8297155 8299457 All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
8299524 8301626 but they're missing the point.
8302994 8305730 You and I both know,
8305797 8308400 I'm looking at the real you right now.
8308466 8310802 My mask allowed me to be myself,
8310869 8312170 completely.
8312237 8313872 No shame,
8314606 8315707 no limits.
8315774 8317609 Why did you write me?
8318343 8319411 What do you mean?
8319477 8321146 All those cards.
8321212 8322747 I told you,
8322814 8324015 we've been doing this together.
8324082 8325350 You're a part of this.
8325417 8326217 We didn't do anything together.
8326284 8327285 We did.
8327352 8328987 What did we just do?
8329054 8330989 I asked you to bring him into the light, and you did.
8331056 8332190 We're such a good team.
8332257 8333625 We're not a team.
8333692 8335727 I never could have gotten him out of there.
8335794 8338129 I'm not physical. My strength is up here.
8338196 8341533 I mean, I had all the pieces, I had the answers.
8341599 8343301 But I didn't know how to make them listen.
8343368 8344602 You gave me that.
8344669 8345837 I gave you nothing.
8345904 8348173 You showed me what was possible.
8348239 8351443 You showed me all it takes is fear
8351509 8353411 and a little focused violence.
8353478 8355013 You inspired me.
8355080 8356781 You're out of your goddamn mind.
8357882 8359250 What?
8359317 8361152 This is all in your head. You're sick, twisted.
8361219 8362520 How can you say that?
8362587 8364189 You think you'll be remembered?
8364255 8366324 You're a pathetic psychopath,
8366391 8367959 -begging for attention. -No.
8368026 8369361 You're gonna die alone in Arkham.
8369427 8372063 -No. No, no, no! -A nobody!
8373898 8375734 No!
8377502 8379904 Ahhh!
8379971 8382841 This is not how this was supposed to go!
8383808 8387312 Ahhh!
8387379 8390815 I had it all planned out!
8390882 8393118 We were gonna be safe here.
8393184 8396621 We could watch the whole thing together.
8396688 8397956 Watch what?
8398022 8399791 Everything!
8401793 8403995 [tense music playing]
8407832 8409734 It was all there.
8411669 8414139 You mean, you didn't figure it out?
8415240 8418109 [Riddler gasps slowly]
8418176 8422514 Oh, you're really not as smart as I thought you were.
8424149 8426718 I guess I gave you too much credit.
8426785 8428686 What have you done?
8428753 8433858 What's black and blue and dead all over?
8436528 8438563 You.
8439931 8442233 If you think you can stop what's coming.

8526417 8529287 Hey, man, I don't think that you should be touching that.

8622981 8624716 [Riddler] Hey, guys.
8624782 8626884 Uh, thanks for all the comments,
8626951 8628553 and, uh, a special thanks to everyone
8628620 8630121 for the tips on detonators.
8630188 8631255 Detonators?
8631322 8632857 I just want to say this will be
8632924 8636294 my last post for a little while, and, uh...
8638296 8640565 what this community has meant to me
8640632 8644502 these weeks, these months,
8644569 8647105 let's just say none of us...
8648673 8650975 is alone anymore. Okay?
8651542 8653177 Jesus.
8653244 8655246 [Riddler huffing]
8655913 8657281 [inhales deeply]
8657348 8661319 Tomorrow's Election Day. [laughing]
8662654 8665456 And Bella Real will win.
8665523 8668626 She promised real change.
8668693 8671062 But we know the truth, don't we?
8671129 8673131 You've seen Gotham's true face now.
8673197 8675099 Together, we've unmasked it.
8675166 8678136 Its corruption, its perversion
8678202 8682106 masquerading under the guise of renewal.
8682173 8686210 But unmasking is not enough.
8688179 8692283 The day of judgment is finally upon us.
8692350 8694952 [in playful tone] And now it is time
8695820 8698322 for retribution.
8698389 8701159 I've parked seven vans
8701225 8703895 all along the city seawall.
8704862 8706864 And on the big night,
8706931 8709233 [whispers] they will go boom.
8713471 8716007 [dramatic music playing]
8719444 8720778 [explosion]
8723147 8725450 -[explosion] -[inaudible] Boom!
8729954 8731956 -[explosion] -[inaudible] Boom!
8733958 8736160 When the vans blow,
8736227 8738963 the flooding will happen so fast,
8739030 8742133 evacuation will not be an option.
8742200 8745136 Those who are not washed away
8745203 8747705 will race through the streets in terror.
8747772 8749607 -[panicked screams] -Call Gordon.
8749674 8751709 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
8751776 8753277 [crowd cheering]
8753344 8755580 [Riddler] As breaking news hits higher ground
8755646 8757248 in Gotham Square Garden,
8757315 8759951 celebrations will turn to panic,
8760017 8761819 as the venue becomes
8761886 8764889 the city's shelter of last resort.
8764956 8766324 [sirens wailing]
8766390 8770394 And that's where all of you come in.
8776534 8779971 Now, when the time arrives, I will already be unmasked.
8780037 8782373 The pigs will have me in their custody,
8782440 8784275 but that's okay.
8784342 8788913 Because then it will be your turn.
8788980 8793351 You'll be there, waiting.
8793417 8795419 [dramatic music playing]
8803928 8806664 It's time for the lies to finally end.
8806731 8811402 [dramatically] False promises of renewal?
8811469 8812670 Change?
8812737 8816340 We'll give them real, real change now.
8816407 8819811 We've spent our lives in this wretched place,
8819877 8821913 [shouts] suffering!
8821979 8824382 Wondering, "Why us?"
8824448 8827718 Now they will spend their last moments wondering,
8827785 8829921 [screams] why them?
8829987 8832223 I can't get through! The lines are down.
8833658 8835459 [sirens wailing]
8837728 8840264 Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!
8840331 8841899 I'm just trying to get out of town, man!
8841966 8845036 Lady, we got bombs going off. The whole city's flooding.
8845102 8846404 You're gonna have to go inside the Garden
8846470 8847872 -with everyone else. -[distant explosion]
8847939 8849440 [people screaming]
8852109 8854378 [crowd clamoring]
8854445 8856581 [sirens wailing]
8856647 8858449 -Lieutenant, who's in charge? -I really don't know.
8858516 8860051 We're just trying to get a handle here, sir.
8860117 8861986 Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!
8862053 8863421 We got an active situation.
8863487 8865256 We need to sweep the building for explosives
8865323 8866691 and get the mayor-elect out of here, now. Where is she?
8866757 8867925 -I can take you there. -Come!
8867992 8869527 [crowd chattering]
8874966 8877168 [tense music playing]
8903761 8905196 [man] If we don't close the doors, we're gonna have...
8905263 8906530 -MCU. -...huge problems.
8906597 8908165 The water's already started to breach.
8908232 8909100 I thought this was a shelter of last resort.
8909166 8910468 Yeah, for a hurricane,
8910534 8912270 but not if the whole seawall comes down.
8912336 8913604 [Bella] I am not gonna let those people die out there.
8913671 8915439 All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
8915506 8917108 -so we can get everyone in. -It's not safe for you here.
8917174 8918609 We need to get you out, Ms. Real.
8918676 8920611 -I'm not going anywhere. -We're under attack, ma'am.
8920678 8922513 Exactly! That's the problem with this city.
8922580 8924682 Everyone's afraid to stand up and do the right thing,
8924749 8925783 but I'm not.
8925850 8927451 -Excuse me. -Ma'am...
8932390 8933691 Everyone, everyone,
8933758 8935960 if I could just get your attention.
8936027 8938462 Please! I just need your attention!
8940932 8942066 [gasps]

9518308 9520744 [Bruce] Wednesday, November 6th.
9520811 9522880 [siren wailing in distance]
9523881 9525983 The city is underwater.
9528418 9530220 The National Guard is coming.
9532089 9535359 Martial law is in effect,
9535425 9537327 but the criminal element never sleeps.
9540130 9543901 Looting and lawlessness will be rampant
9543967 9547471 in the parts of the city no one can get to.
9547538 9550274 I can already see things will get worse
9550340 9551708 before they get better.
9554278 9557781 And some will seize the chance to grab everything they can.
9558882 9560817 [Bella] We will rebuild.
9560884 9562953 But not just our city.
9563020 9565489 We must rebuild people's faith
9565556 9567357 in our institutions,
9567424 9569493 in our elected officials,
9569560 9571361 in each other.
9571428 9574665 Together, we will learn to believe in Gotham again.
9574731 9575732 [woman speaks indistinctly]
9575799 9577701 [helicopter blades whirring]
9579169 9581104 [Bruce] I'm starting to see now.
9582472 9584808 I have had an effect here...
9586677 9588812 but not the one I intended.
9590914 9594151 Vengeance won't change the past,
9595419 9597921 mine or anyone else's.
9600257 9602292 I have to become more.
9605362 9607931 People need hope.
9607998 9610400 To know someone's out there for them.
9614004 9615939 The city's angry,
9616673 9618175 scarred,
9619109 9620310 like me.
9622412 9625716 Our scars can destroy us.
9625782 9628752 Even after the physical wounds have healed.
9630053 9632055 But if we survive them,
9633457 9635359 they can transform us.
9637060 9639196 They can give us the power
9639963 9641765 to endure...
9642866 9645168 and the strength to fight.
9647904 9649940 [reporter] We are live. As you can see,
9650007 9652909 the masked vigilante atop Gotham Square Garden,
9652976 9654378 helping to save the lives
9654444 9656413 -of hundreds of victims. -[Riddler moaning]
9656480 9657914 And now as first responders
9657981 9659349 desperately scramble to help the injured,
9659416 9661985 a mysterious masked man emerges,
9662052 9664521 heroically pulling the victims right through that skylight...
9664588 9667157 [man] Isn't that just terrible?
9668458 9670193 Him...
9670260 9674798 raining on your parade like that? [tutting]
9678935 9681138 What is it they say?
9682072 9684408 "One day you're on top...
9685842 9687778 the next,
9688879 9691415 you're a clown."
9691481 9693216 [exhales ruefully]
9693283 9694418 Well...
9696053 9698922 let me tell you, there are worse things to be.
9698989 9701091 [Riddler weeping]
9701158 9704094 Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.
9705328 9707197 You did so well.
9711601 9712803 And you know,
9714137 9717507 Gotham loves a comeback story.
9727551 9729219 [Riddler] Who are you?
9729286 9732022 [man] Well, that's the question,
9733190 9734324 isn't it?
9737427 9739930 Riddle me this...
9741998 9744768 "The less of them you have,
9744835 9748905 the more one is worth."
9754244 9756046 A friend.
9758482 9761485 [laughing maniacally]
9764755 9767824 [both laughing maniacally]
9782405 9783874 -[Batman] You're leaving. -[gasps]
9783940 9785208 [Selina] Jesus.
9786943 9788812 Don't you ever just say hello?
9791014 9792215 [cat meows]
9793550 9795085 Where will you go?
9796486 9799289 I don't know. Upstate.
9799356 9801124 Bludhaven, maybe.
9801825 9803026 Why?
9803994 9805362 You asking me to stay?
9812202 9814571 You know this place is never gonna change.
9814638 9817307 With Carmine gone, it's only gonna get worse for you.
9817374 9819409 There's gonna be a power grab.
9820777 9822078 It'll be bloody.
9822579 9823947 I know.
9825582 9826716 But the city can change.
9826783 9828151 It won't.
