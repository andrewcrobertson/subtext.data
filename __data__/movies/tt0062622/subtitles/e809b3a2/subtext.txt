1543907 1546281 Here you are, sir.<br />Main level, please.
1547246 1549077 Right. See you on the way back.
1549124 1550373 - Bye.<br />- Bye.
1551876 1553410 - Good morning, sir.<br />- Good morning.
1553455 1555469 We haven't seen you up here<br />for a long time.
1555502 1556878 No. Very nice to see you again.
1556961 1559797 - Did you have a pleasant flight, sir?<br />- Yes, very nice, thanks.
1559843 1563056 I think Mr. Miller of Station Security<br />is supposed to be meeting me.
1563132 1564135 May I call him for you?
1564219 1565387 Would you, please? Here he is!
1565471 1567431 - Hello, Dr. Floyd.<br />- Hello, Miller! How are you?
1567473 1569725 - Sorry I'm late.<br />- That's all right. You look great.
1569808 1571643 Thank you.<br />It's nice to have you back.
1571685 1574063 - Did you have a good flight?<br />- Very nice indeed.
1574146 1575606 - Well, shall we go through?<br />- Okay.
1575647 1577149 Will you please use Number 17?
1577191 1578984 - Thank you, Miss Turner.<br />- Thank you.
1579026 1580110 This way.
1585449 1587701 Welcome to Voice Print Identification.
1587951 1589870 When you see the red light go on ...
1589953 1592414 would you please state<br />in the following order:
1592498 1596335 your destination, your nationality<br />and your full name.
1596794 1599630 Surname first,<br />Christian name and initial.
1601340 1605302 Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.
1608013 1611975 Thank you. You are cleared<br />through Voice Print Identification.
1612476 1613602 Thank you.
1620734 1622403 Have I got time for breakfast?
1622486 1623946 I think we can manage that.
1624029 1625239 How long have I got?
1625322 1627950 Your flight leaves<br />in an hour and ten minutes.
1628033 1630994 I've reserved a table for you<br />in the Earthlight Room.
1631662 1635165 It's been about seven or eight months<br />since you were here last, isn't it?
1635249 1636959 Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.
1637042 1640337 I suppose you saw the work on the<br />new section when you came in here?
1640379 1642715 - Yes, coming along great, huh?<br />- Yeah, it's fine.
1642798 1643882 Oh, wait a minute!
1643966 1647386 I've got a few calls to make.<br />I'll meet you in the restaurant.
1665571 1668407 Will Mr. Travers please contact<br />the Met Office?
1669658 1672578 Will Mr. Travers<br />please contact the Met Office?
1677708 1678542 Yes?
1679918 1681712 - How are you, squirt?<br />- All right.
1681754 1683255 What are you doin'?
1684840 1685799 Playing.
1686091 1687342 Where's Mommy?
1687843 1689261 Gone to shopping.
1689553 1691889 - Well, who's taking care of ya?<br />- Rachel.
1692222 1693891 May I speak to Rachel, please?
1693932 1695726 She's gone to the bathroom.
1695851 1698270 Are you coming to my party tomorrow?
1698812 1701023 I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.
1701690 1702733 Why not?
1703108 1705527 Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.
1705819 1708197 Very sorry about it,<br />but I just can't!
1709615 1712451 I'm gonna send you<br />a very nice present, though.
1714119 1715162 All right.
1715245 1717581 - Anything special that you want?<br />- Yes.
1717748 1718749 What?
1719083 1720209 A telephone.
1721168 1723170 We've got lots of telephones already.
1723253 1726006 Can't you think of anything else<br />you want for your birthday?
1726090 1727549 Something very special?
1728092 1729635 - Yes.<br />- What?
1729927 1731095 A bush baby.
1731136 1733680 A bush baby?<br />Well, we'll have to see about that.
1733764 1735724 I want you to tell Mommy<br />something for me.
1735808 1737684 - Will you remember?<br />- Yes.
1738018 1740479 Well, tell Mommy<br />that I telephoned. Okay?
1741647 1742398 Yes.
1742481 1745109 And that I'll try<br />to telephone again tomorrow.
1745567 1747361 Now, will you tell her that?
1748404 1749238 Yes.
1749405 1752324 Okay, sweetheart.<br />Now, have a nice birthday tomorrow.
1752408 1753450 All right.
1753826 1756662 And have a nice birthday party<br />tomorrow, too, huh?
1757621 1758706 All right.
1758831 1761709 Okay, now, take care and be<br />a good girl, won't you?
1761792 1763127 All right. Bye-bye!
1763168 1765754 Bye-bye! Happy birthday.
1779435 1781645 Elena, how nice to see you again.
1781687 1783814 What a wonderful surprise<br />to meet you here!
1783856 1786942 - You're looking wonderful.<br />- Thank you. You're looking well, too.
1787026 1789194 This is my good friend,<br />Dr. Heywood Floyd.
1789278 1791739 - I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.<br />- How do you do?
1791822 1793949 - Dr. Stretyneva.<br />- How do you do?
1794033 1795868 And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.
1795951 1798579 How do you do?<br />I've heard a lot about you.
1798662 1800122 Won't you sit down?
1800539 1802374 - Well, we —<br />- No, no, please.
1802916 1804376 Well, thank you.
1804668 1807671 - Would you like a drink, Doctor?<br />- No, thank you.
1807755 1811050 I haven't had breakfast yet.<br />Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.
1811133 1814011 I'll just sit with you a few minutes<br />and then I must be off.
1814053 1817097 - Are you quite sure?<br />- I'm quite sure, thank you.
1817723 1819850 - And how's Gregor?<br />- He's fine.
1820225 1823562 He's been doing some underwater<br />research in the Baltic so ...
1823729 1827858 I'm afraid we don't get a chance to<br />see very much of each other these days.
1827900 1830027 When you do see him,<br />give him my regards, huh?
1830069 1831570 Yes, of course.
1831945 1834531 Well, where are you all off to?<br />Up or down?
1834656 1836200 Oh, we're going home.
1836367 1840579 We have just spent three months<br />calibrating the new antennae at Tchalinko.
1841455 1844291 - And what about you?<br />- I'm just on my way up to Clavius.
1844375 1845751 Oh, are you?
1848379 1851673 Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think<br />I'm being too inquisitive, but ...
1851757 1854259 perhaps you can clear up<br />the great big mystery ...
1854343 1856553 about what is going on up there.
1857930 1859890 I'm afraid I don't know<br />what you mean.
1859932 1862059 Oh, it's just that<br />for the past two weeks ...
1862101 1865437 some extremely odd things<br />have been happening at Clavius.
1865771 1867439 - Oh, really?<br />- Yes, yes.
1868107 1872444 For one thing, whenever you phone the<br />base all you get is a recording which ...
1872653 1876782 repeats that the phone lines<br />are temporarily out of order.
1878367 1882079 Probably having some trouble with<br />their equipment or something like that.
1882162 1884748 That's what we thought<br />was the explanation at first ...
1884790 1887376 but it has been going on now<br />for the past ten days.
1887459 1890462 You have not been able to contact<br />anyone for the past ten days?
1890546 1891797 That's right.
1892047 1892965 Oh, I see.
1893006 1894633 And there's another thing, Heywood.
1894717 1897720 Two days ago, one of our rocket<br />buses was denied permission ...
1897803 1900097 for an emergency landing at Clavius.
1900180 1901473 That does sound odd.
1901557 1904935 Yes, yes. I'm afraid there's going<br />to be a bit of a row about that.
1904977 1908939 Denying the men permission to land is a<br />direct violation of the I.A.S. Convention.
1909023 1910816 Yes, of course. Of course.
1910858 1913736 - Did the crew get back all right?<br />- Yes, fortunately they did.
1913819 1915696 Well, I'm glad about that.
1919158 1923120 At the risk of pressing you on a point<br />you seem reticent to discuss ...
1923454 1926040 may I ask you<br />a straightforward question?
1926248 1927583 Well, certainly.
1930419 1934465 Quite frankly, we have had some very<br />reliable intelligence reports that ...
1934965 1938177 quite a serious epidemic<br />has broken out on Clavius.
1938677 1941430 Something, apparently,<br />of an unknown origin.
1942806 1945100 Is this, in fact,<br />what has happened?
1950522 1952483 I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but ...
1954026 1956695 I'm really not at liberty<br />to discuss this.
1958364 1959573 I understand.
1960616 1964078 But this epidemic could quite<br />easily spread to our base.
1964286 1966538 We should be given<br />all the facts, Dr. Floyd.
1966580 1968540 Yes, I know.
1971418 1974004 As I said, I'm not<br />at liberty to discuss it.
1977174 1980260 Now, are you sure you won't<br />change your mind about that drink?
1980344 1982471 No, I'm positive.<br />Now, I really must be going.
1982554 1985974 I hope that you and your wife can come<br />to the I.A.C. Conference in June.
1986058 1987685 We're gonna try.<br />Hope we can make it.
1987768 1991355 And if you do, you remember to bring<br />that darling little daughter with you!
1991397 1994858 Well, that will all depend on school<br />vacations and all that sort of thing.
1994900 1995859 But if we can, we will.
1995901 1999488 Don't forget you have a standing<br />invitation if you ever get to the States.
1999571 2002574 No, of course not. Gregor and I<br />will look forward to seeing you.
2002658 2004243 Well, goodbye, Elena.
2004743 2007663 It has been a pleasure meeting<br />you all, Dr. Smyslov.
2007746 2011709 Whatever the reasons for your visit to<br />Clavius, the very best of luck to you.
2011792 2012918 Thank you.
2013252 2014294 Ladies.
2489895 2491355 Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.
2491397 2493649 I'm through now.<br />Thank you very much, gentlemen.
2493732 2494858 You're welcome.
2508122 2509164 Well ...
2509748 2514169 I know you will all want to join<br />with me in welcoming our ...
2514962 2517047 distinguished friend and colleague ...
2517089 2520926 from the National Council of<br />Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.
2521552 2526265 Dr. Floyd has come up specially<br />to Calvius to be with us today.
2527766 2531270 And before the briefing I know he'd<br />like to have a few words with you.
2531353 2532479 Dr. Floyd?
2545409 2547578 Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.
2547619 2548954 Hi, everybody.
2549121 2551081 Nice to be back again.
2553792 2557254 First of all, I bring a personal<br />message from Dr. Howell who ...
2557421 2560674 has asked me to convey his deepest<br />appreciation to all of you ...
2560758 2563635 for the many sacrifices<br />you have had to make.
2563927 2567222 And, of course, his congratulations<br />on your discovery ...
2568307 2572770 which may well prove to be among the most<br />significant in the history of science.
2575272 2576398 Now ...
2577149 2580986 I know there have been some<br />conflicting views held by some of you ...
2581320 2584615 regarding the need for<br />complete security in this matter.
2585157 2588410 More specifically, your<br />opposition to the cover story ...
2589370 2593332 created to give the impression that<br />there is an epidemic at the base.
2593957 2597211 I understand that beyond it<br />being a matter of principle ...
2598379 2602091 many of you are troubled<br />by the concern and anxiety ...
2602174 2606553 this story of an epidemic might cause<br />to your relatives and friends on Earth.
2607513 2610683 Well, I completely sympathize<br />with your negative views.
2612476 2615521 I find this cover story<br />personally embarrassing myself.
2616939 2620693 However, I accept the need<br />for absolute secrecy in this.
2622027 2623862 And I hope you will, too.
2626365 2629535 Now, I'm sure you are all aware<br />of the extremely grave potential ...
2629618 2632287 for cultural shock<br />and social disorientation ...
2632371 2634498 contained in this present situation ...
2634540 2637543 if the facts were prematurely<br />and suddenly made public ...
2637584 2640379 without adequate preparation<br />and conditioning.
2642339 2644717 Anyway, this is the view<br />of the Council.
2646176 2650180 The purpose of my visit here is to<br />gather additional facts and opinions ...
2650389 2651932 on the situation ...
2652725 2655310 and to prepare a report<br />to the Council ...
2655894 2657855 recommending when and how ...
2658939 2661442 the news should eventually<br />be announced.
2662234 2665946 Now, if any of you would like to<br />give me your views and opinions ...
2666238 2670576 in private if you like, I will be only<br />too happy to include them in my report.
2673203 2675122 Well, I think that's about it.
2675956 2677332 Any questions?
2680085 2684298 Dr. Floyd, have you any idea<br />how much longer this cover story ...
2684381 2686341 will have to be maintained?
2688093 2689553 I don't know, Bill.
2690095 2693891 I suppose it will be maintained as long<br />as is deemed necessary by the Council.
2693932 2697519 There must be adequate time for a full<br />study to be made on the situation ...
2697603 2700981 before any thought can be given<br />to making a public announcement.
2701065 2704276 Oh, yes, as some of you already know,<br />the Council has requested ...
2704360 2707279 that formal security oaths are<br />to be obtained in writing ...
2707321 2710115 from everyone who has<br />any knowledge of this event.
2712159 2714286 Are there any more questions?
2719708 2724380 I'm sure we all want to cooperate<br />with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible ...
2725714 2728425 and as there seems<br />to be no more questions ...
2728717 2730844 I think we ought to get on<br />with the briefing.
2730928 2733389 - Thank you, Dr. Floyd.<br />- Thank you.
2830736 2832237 Anybody hungry?
2834740 2836700 - What we've got?<br />- You name it.
2841163 2843415 - What's this? Chicken?<br />- Something like that.
2843499 2845042 Tastes the same, anyway.
2846001 2847211 Any ham?
2847378 2849046 Ham, ham, ham ...
2854093 2858180 - Looks pretty good.<br />- They're getting better at it all the time.
2859932 2862184 That was an excellent speech<br />you gave us, Heywood.
2862267 2863435 It certainly was.
2864061 2866146 I'm sure it beefed up<br />morale a hell of a lot.
2866230 2867398 Thanks, Ralph.
2867439 2870776 I want to say to both of you that<br />I think you've done a wonderful job.
2870859 2872778 I appreciate the way<br />you've handled this thing.
2872820 2876699 Well, the way we look at it, it's our job<br />to do this thing the way you want it done.
2876782 2879076 And we're only too happy<br />to be able to oblige.
2879618 2881203 Have you seen these yet?
2881286 2882621 Take a look at them.
2882705 2884998 Here's what started the whole thing.
2885541 2887084 Oh, yes.
2887167 2890963 When we first found it, we thought it<br />might be an outcrop of magnetic rock ...
2891004 2894258 but all the geological<br />evidence was against it.
2894341 2899013 And not even a big nickel iron meteorite<br />could produce a field as intense as this.
2899304 2900723 So, we decided to have a look.
2900806 2903809 We thought it might be the upper<br />part of some buried structure ...
2903892 2905477 so we excavated out on all sides.
2905561 2907771 But, unfortunately,<br />we didn't find anything else.
2907855 2910899 And what's more, the evidence<br />seems pretty conclusive that ...
2910983 2914236 it has not been covered up by<br />natural erosion or other forces.
2914319 2917156 It seems to have been<br />deliberately buried.
2917656 2919116 Deliberately buried.
2923287 2924705 How about a little coffee?
2924788 2927041 - Great.<br />- Good idea.
2932421 2935466 I don't suppose you have any idea<br />what the damn thing is, huh?
2935507 2937384 I wish to hell we did.
2938010 2942014 No, the only thing we're sure of is<br />it was buried four million years ago.
2942556 2946643 Well, I must say, you guys have<br />certainly come up with something.
3533480 3534732 Good evening.
3534940 3538068 Three weeks ago, the American<br />spacecraft, Discovery One ...
3538110 3541030 left on its half-billion<br />mile voyage to Jupiter.
3541113 3544742 This marked the first manned attempt<br />to reach this distant planet.
3545200 3548537 Earlier this afternoon,<br />"The World Tonight" recorded an interview ...
3548620 3552833 with the crew of Discovery at a distance<br />of 80 million miles from Earth.
3553417 3557046 It took 7 minutes for our words<br />to reach the giant spacecraft ...
3557129 3560424 but this time delay has been<br />edited from this recording.
3560466 3563177 Our reporter, Martin Amer,<br />speaks to the crew.
3564094 3566972 The crew of Discovery One<br />consists of five men ...
3567348 3571810 and one of the latest generation<br />of the HAL-9000 computers.
3572603 3574980 Three of the five men<br />were put aboard asleep ...
3575022 3577983 or to be more precise,<br />in a state of hibernation.
3578442 3583113 They were Dr. Charles Hunter,<br />Dr. Jack Kimball and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.
3583947 3586784 We spoke with Mission Commander,<br />Dr. David Bowman ...
3586825 3589161 and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.
3589328 3592331 Well, good afternoon, gentlemen.<br />How is everything going?
3592373 3596210 Marvellous. We have no —<br />we have no complaints.
3597169 3600631 Well, I'm very glad to hear that<br />and I'm sure that the entire world ...
3600672 3604134 would join me in wishing you<br />a safe and successful voyage.
3604259 3606261 - Thanks very much.<br />- Thank you.
3606428 3610224 Although hibernation has been<br />used on previous space efforts ...
3610516 3614978 this is the first time that men have been<br />put into hibernation before departure.
3615020 3616397 Why was this done?
3616855 3620275 Well, this was done in order to achieve<br />the maximum conservation ...
3620359 3623737 of our life-support capabilities,<br />basically food and air.
3624029 3627658 Now, the three hibernating crew<br />members represent the survey team.
3627991 3631704 And their efforts won't be utilized<br />until we are approaching Jupiter.
3631954 3635249 Dr. Poole, what's it like<br />while you are in hibernation?
3636834 3640504 It's exactly like being asleep;<br />you have absolutely no sense of time.
3640546 3643007 The only difference is<br />you don't dream.
3643257 3645968 As I understand it,<br />you only breathe once a minute.
3646051 3647219 Is this true?
3647302 3648262 That's right.
3648345 3652099 And your heart beats three times a minute,<br />body temperature is usually down ...
3652182 3654518 to about three degrees centigrade.
3654560 3658063 The sixth member of the Discovery crew<br />was not concerned ...
3658147 3660399 about the problems of hibernation.
3660482 3663527 For he was the latest result<br />in machine intelligence.
3664111 3668490 The HAL-9000 computer<br />which can reproduce ...
3668907 3671910 though some experts still prefer<br />to use the word "mimic" ...
3671994 3676915 most of the activities of the human brain<br />and with incalculably greater speed ...
3676999 3678417 and reliability.
3678751 3682379 We next spoke<br />with the HAL-9000 computer ...
3682588 3685382 whom, we learned,<br />one addresses as Hal.
3686258 3688635 Good afternoon, Hal.<br />How's everything going?
3688719 3692389 Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.<br />Everything's going extremely well.
3692848 3695642 Hal, you have an enormous<br />responsibility on this mission.
3695726 3698228 In many ways, perhaps<br />the greatest responsibility ...
3698312 3700397 of any single mission element.
3700564 3703525 You are the brain and central<br />nervous system of the ship.
3703609 3707488 Your responsibilities include<br />watching over the men in hibernation.
3707571 3710449 Does this ever cause you<br />any lack of confidence?
3710866 3712993 Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.
3713452 3717414 The 9000 Series is the most<br />reliable computer ever made.
3718499 3722878 No 9000 computer has ever made<br />a mistake or distorted information.
3723962 3727091 We are all by any practical<br />definition of the words ...
3727466 3730260 fool proof and incapable of error.
3731053 3735057 Hal, despite your enormous intellect,<br />are you ever frustrated ...
3735140 3738102 by your dependence on people<br />to carry out actions?
3738477 3740187 Not in the slightest bit.
3740938 3742731 I enjoy working with people.
3743273 3747277 I have a stimulating relationship<br />with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.
3747986 3752408 My mission responsibilities range over<br />the entire operation of the ship ...
3752741 3754743 so l am constantly occupied.
3755828 3758914 I am putting myself<br />to the fullest possible use ...
3759498 3764128 which is all, I think, that any<br />conscious entity can ever hope to do.
3764878 3768257 Dr. Poole, what's it like living<br />for the better part of a year ...
3768340 3770467 in such close proximity with Hal?
3771927 3774346 It's pretty close to what<br />you said about him earlier.
3774388 3776557 He's just like the<br />sixth member of the crew.
3776640 3780811 You very quickly get adjusted to the idea<br />that he talks. You think of him ...
3781020 3783147 really as just another person.
3783188 3786984 In talking to the computer, one gets<br />the sense that he is capable ...
3787026 3788527 of emotional response.
3788569 3791071 For example, when I asked him<br />about his abilities ...
3791155 3795242 I sensed a certain pride in his answer<br />about his accuracy and perfection.
3795534 3798287 Do you believe that Hal<br />has genuine emotions?
3799705 3802624 Oh, yes. Well, he acts<br />like he has genuine emotions.
3802833 3806545 Of course, he's programmed that way to<br />make it easier for us to talk to him.
3806628 3808881 But, as to whether or not<br />he has real feelings ...
3808964 3812217 is something I don't think<br />anyone can truthfully answer.
3837034 3838410 Excuse me, Frank.
3839328 3840454 What is it, Hal?
3840537 3843582 We've got the transmission<br />from your parents coming in.
3846460 3848921 Put it on here, please.<br />Take me in a bit.
3849046 3850130 Certainly.
3863352 3865062 - Hello, Frank.<br />- Happy birthday, darling.
3865145 3867398 Happy birthday.<br />Many happy returns of the day.
3867481 3868982 A bit higher, please.
3869066 3871276 Now, Mother and I are both<br />feeling wonderful, too.
3871360 3873362 Ray and Sally were going<br />to be here, too ...
3873445 3876198 but at the last minute<br />Ray's back went bad on him again.
3876281 3877741 How do you like your cake, dear?
3877783 3880285 Looks great, doesn't it?<br />Sorry you can't be with us.
3880327 3881829 Oh, I ran into Bob the other day.
3881912 3884081 He said to be sure<br />and wish you a happy birthday.
3884164 3887126 All my students made me promise<br />to send their best wishes, too.
3887167 3889753 You know they talk about you<br />all the time in the classroom.
3889837 3892297 You're a big celebrity<br />in the second grade.
3892381 3894133 You know we were on<br />television last week?
3894216 3897386 Oh, yes! Your mother and I<br />and Dave's parents were interviewed ...
3897469 3899596 about what we thought of<br />our illustrious son.
3899638 3903267 You can imagine what we told them.<br />I think it's being broadcast next Thursday.
3903350 3904935 Perhaps you'll be able to listen in.
3905102 3907271 Oh, we were thrilled<br />about Elaine and Bill, dear.
3907312 3911191 I'll be glad to get the present for you,<br />but please tell me how much to spend.
3911275 3913902 Oh, yes, Frank,<br />about your AGS-19 payments —
3913986 3915654 I think I straightened<br />it out for you.
3915738 3918365 I talked to the Accounting Office<br />in Houston yesterday ...
3918449 3922453 and they said you should be receiving<br />your higher rates of pay by next month.
3923162 3925456 Well, I can't think<br />of anything else to say.
3925497 3928959 - Oh, our love to Dave.<br />- Be sure to give him our best regards.
3929918 3932629 We wish you the very<br />happiest of birthdays.
3933505 3934882 All the best, son.
3947227 3948854 See you next Wednesday.
3952358 3953984 Happy birthday, Frank.
3955069 3957446 Thank you, Hal.<br />A bit flatter, please.
3976590 3978550 Anyway, queen takes pawn —
3980386 3982179 Bishop takes knight's pawn.
3990312 3991689 Rook, king, one.
3992064 3994525 I'm sorry, Frank.<br />I think you missed it.
3995609 3998570 Queen to bishop, three.<br />Bishop takes queen.
3999363 4001365 Knight takes bishop. Mate.
4006120 4008622 Looks like you're right.<br />Very good.
4009498 4011500 Thank you for a very enjoyable game.
4011583 4012376 Thank you.
4050664 4052791 - Good evening, Dave.<br />- How are you doing, Hal?
4052875 4056253 - Everything's running smoothly. And you?<br />- Oh, not too bad.
4056295 4059298 - Have you been doing some more work?<br />- A few sketches.
4059423 4061133 - May I see them?<br />- Sure.
4065846 4068015 That's a very nice rendering, Dave.
4069183 4071435 I think you've improved a great deal.
4072853 4075105 - Can you hold it a bit closer?<br />- Sure.
4077983 4080069 That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?
4083238 4084573 By the way ...
4085574 4088160 Do you mind<br />if I ask you a personal question?
4089161 4090621 No, no. Not at all.
4090954 4093874 Well, forgive me for<br />being so inquisitive ...
4095334 4097753 but during the past<br />few weeks I've wondered ...
4097836 4101799 whether you might have been having<br />some second thoughts about the mission?
4101840 4103217 How do you mean?
4105135 4107137 It's rather difficult to define.
4108764 4111809 Perhaps I'm just projecting<br />my own concern about it.
4113519 4117147 I know I've never completely<br />freed myself of the suspicion ...
4118023 4121485 that there are some extremely<br />odd things about this mission.
4123153 4126365 I'm sure you will agree there<br />is some truth in what I say.
4129201 4131954 I don't know. That's a rather<br />difficult question to answer.
4132037 4134665 You don't mind talking<br />about it, do you, Dave?
4135457 4136917 Oh, no, not at all.
4138252 4140504 Certainly no one could<br />have been unaware of ...
4140546 4143841 the very strange stories<br />floating around before we left.
4145384 4148262 Rumours of something<br />being dug up on the Moon.
4150097 4152641 I never gave these<br />stories much credence ...
4153642 4157771 but particularly in view of some of<br />the other things that have happened ...
4157938 4160649 I find them difficult<br />to put out of my mind.
4161400 4162693 For instance:
4163068 4166697 The way all our preparations were<br />kept under such tight security ...
4167948 4169533 and the melodramatic touch ...
4169575 4172953 of putting Drs. Hunter, Kimball<br />and Kaminsky aboard ...
4173746 4178000 already in hibernation after four months<br />of separate training on their own.
4179585 4182087 You working up your<br />crew psychology report?
4183714 4185090 Of course, I am.
4185507 4188552 Sorry about this.<br />I know it's a bit silly.
4190012 4191263 Just a moment.
4191889 4193098 Just a moment.
4194767 4198228 I have just picked up a fault<br />in the AE-35 unit.
4199772 4203442 It's going to go<br />100% failure within 72 hours.
4206278 4208906 - You are still within operational limits?<br />- Yes.
4209323 4211700 And it will stay that way<br />until it fails.
4211784 4214244 Would you say we had a<br />reliable 72 hours until failure?
4214328 4217414 Yes. That's a completely reliable figure.
4219833 4223087 We'll have to bring it in, but I'd<br />like to go over this with Frank ...
4223170 4227007 and get on to Mission Control.<br />Let me have a hard copy of it, please.
4309715 4312176 X-Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.
4312676 4314928 Roger to your two-zero-one-three.
4315763 4318307 Sorry you fellows are having<br />a bit of trouble.
4318390 4322978 We are reviewing telematic information<br />in our Mission Simulator and will advise.
4323812 4329068 Roger your plan to go EVA and replace<br />Alpha-Echo-35 unit prior to failure.
4358013 4359807 Prepare "B" pod for EVA, Hal.
4381620 4383330 Open the pod doors, Hal.
4795075 4798328 Well, Hal, I'm damned if I<br />can find anything wrong with it.
4798704 4799705 Yes ...
4801832 4803167 it's puzzling.
4804543 4807880 I don't think I've ever seen<br />anything quite like this before.
4812009 4813469 I would recommend ...
4814219 4817639 that we put the unit back<br />in operation and let it fail.
4819099 4822353 It should then be a simple<br />matter to track down the cause.
4824104 4827066 We can certainly afford<br />to be out of communication ...
4827566 4830361 for the short time it<br />will take to replace it.
4839411 4841914 X-Ray Delta One,<br />this is Mission Control.
4842373 4844375 Roger your one-niner-three-zero.
4845250 4849463 We concur with your plan to replace<br />Number One unit to check fault prediction.
4849963 4852716 We should advise you, however,<br />that our preliminary findings ...
4852758 4855761 indicate that your onboard<br />Niner-triple-zero computer ...
4855803 4858013 is in error predicting the fault.
4858097 4860683 I say again,<br />in error predicting the fault.
4861433 4865896 I know this sounds rather incredible,<br />but this conclusion is based on ...
4866105 4869066 results from our twin<br />Niner-triple-zero computer.
4869775 4873153 We are sceptical ourselves and we are<br />running crosschecking routines ...
4873237 4875948 to determine reliability<br />of this conclusion.
4876156 4878158 Sorry about this little snag, fellows.
4878242 4881078 We'll get this info to you<br />just as soon as we work it out.
4881120 4883622 X-Ray Delta One,<br />this is Mission Control.
4883706 4886166 Two-zero-four-nine.<br />Transmission concluded.
4891213 4894091 I hope the two of you<br />are not concerned about this.
4894800 4896135 No, I'm not, Hal.
4896468 4897886 Are you quite sure?
4898303 4901265 - Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.<br />- Of course.
4902850 4904935 How would you account for<br />the discrepancy ...
4904977 4906937 between you and the twin 9000?
4907104 4909982 Well, I don't think there is<br />any question about it.
4910899 4913861 It can only be attributable<br />to human error.
4915487 4917990 This sort of thing<br />has cropped up before ...
4918490 4921160 and it has always been due<br />to human error.
4925497 4926790 Listen, Hal ...
4927416 4930044 there's never been<br />any instance at all of ...
4930127 4933297 a computer error occurring<br />in a 9000 Series, has there?
4933380 4935007 None whatsoever, Frank.
4935257 4938469 The 9000 Series has a<br />perfect operational record.
4939136 4943390 Of course, I know the wonderful<br />achievements of the 9000 Series, but ...
4944391 4947394 Are you certain there's never been<br />any case of even the most ...
4947478 4949480 insignificant computer error?
4950022 4951648 None whatsoever, Frank.
4952274 4955152 Quite honestly,<br />I wouldn't worry myself about that.
4960491 4962534 Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.
4964161 4965996 Fine, thanks very much.
4968707 4969833 Oh, Frank?
4970042 4972336 I'm having trouble<br />with my transmitter in "C" pod.
4972378 4975214 Would you come down<br />and take a look at it with me?
4975381 4976715 See ya later, Hal.
4998028 4999863 Rotate "C" pod, please, Hal.
5008706 5010916 What sort of trouble<br />have you had, Dave?
5011000 5013794 I've been getting some<br />interference in "D" channel.
5013919 5015587 We'll have a look at it.
5021719 5023178 Open the door, Hal.
5042281 5044074 Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
5057421 5059423 Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.
5067931 5069767 Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
5072811 5074605 Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
5076857 5078776 I don't think he can hear us.
5078817 5080652 Rotate the pod, please, Hal!
5082404 5084156 Yeah, sure, we're okay.
5087785 5089161 What do you think?
5089578 5093290 - I'm not sure. What do you think?<br />- I've got a bad feeling about it.
5093499 5095292 - You do?<br />- Yeah. Definitely.
5096043 5097127 Don't you?
5098504 5100255 I don't know. I think so.
5101173 5105469 Of course, he's right about the 9000 Series<br />having a perfect operational record.
5105552 5106553 They do.
5106637 5109890 Unfortunately, that sounds<br />a little like famous last words.
5110557 5114895 Yeah. Still, it was his idea to carry out<br />the failure mode analysis, wasn't it?
5116146 5119441 It should certainly indicate his<br />integrity and self-confidence.
5119525 5121985 If he were wrong it would be<br />the surest way of proving it.
5122027 5124071 It would be<br />if he knew he was wrong.
5126740 5130953 Look, Dave, I can't put my finger on it,<br />but I sense something strange about him.
5132538 5136041 I can't think of a good reason not<br />to put back the Number One unit and ...
5136125 5139628 carry on with the failure mode analysis.<br />- No, no, I agree about that.
5140546 5141755 Let's get on with it.
5141839 5144008 Okay. But, look, Dave.
5145426 5148220 Let's say we put the unit back<br />and it doesn't fail, huh?
5148303 5152349 That would pretty well wrap it up as<br />far as Hal was concerned, wouldn't it?
5153142 5156603 - Well, we'd be in very serious trouble.<br />- We would, wouldn't we?
5156895 5158605 What the hell can we do?
5161608 5166071 - We wouldn't have too many alternatives.<br />- I don't think we'd have any alternatives.
5166405 5170492 There isn't a single aspect of ship<br />operation that's not under his control.
5170701 5172536 If he were proved<br />to be malfunctioning ...
5172578 5175873 I don't see how we would have<br />any choice but disconnection.
5179168 5180919 I'm afraid I agree with you.
5181003 5182921 There'd be nothing else to do.
5184506 5186342 - It'd be a bit tricky.<br />- Yeah.
5187760 5190387 We'd have to cut<br />his higher brain functions ...
5190637 5194558 without disturbing the purely<br />automatic and regulatory systems.
5196393 5198604 We'd have to work out<br />the transfer procedures ...
5198687 5201774 for continuing the mission under<br />ground-based computer control.
5201857 5205861 Yeah. That looks far safer than<br />allowing Hal to continue running things.
5207112 5209698 You know,<br />another thing just occurred to me.
5210449 5213327 As far as I know, no 9000 computer<br />has ever been disconnected.
5213410 5215621 Well, no 9000 computer<br />has ever fouled up before.
5215704 5217289 That's not what I mean.
5219416 5221877 I'm not so sure<br />what he'd think about it.
5579735 5581820 Prepare "B" pod for EVA, Hal.
5584990 5586575 Made radio contact with him yet?
5586658 5588327 The radio is still dead.
5588619 5591747 - Do you have a positive track on him?<br />- Yes. I have a good track.
5591830 5593415 Do you know what happened?
5593499 5596293 I'm sorry, Dave.<br />I don't have enough information.
5596543 5598170 Open the pod door, Hal.
6042114 6044325 Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.
6052374 6054585 Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.
6060174 6061925 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
6065346 6067139 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
6068265 6069892 Do you read me, Hal?
6073103 6074563 Do you read me, Hal?
6077191 6078984 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
6081070 6082863 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
6083489 6084948 Do you read me, Hal?
6085282 6087701 Affirmative, Dave. I read you.
6091330 6093165 Open the pod bay doors, Hal.
6094667 6098045 I'm sorry, Dave.<br />I'm afraid I can't do that.
6100756 6102216 What's the problem?
6102883 6106095 I think you know what the problem<br />is just as well as I do.
6106387 6108347 What are you talking about, Hal?
6109181 6112851 This mission is too important for me<br />to allow you to jeopardize it.
6114561 6117064 I don't know<br />what you're talking about, Hal.
6118732 6121985 I know that you and Frank<br />were planning to disconnect me ...
6123070 6126365 and I'm afraid that's something<br />I cannot allow to happen.
6130995 6133497 Where the hell did<br />you get that idea, Hal?
6134498 6137710 Although you took very thorough<br />precautions in the pod ...
6137793 6139586 against my hearing you ...
6140421 6142381 I could see your lips move.
6154727 6155978 All right, Hal.
6159523 6162026 I'll go in through<br />the emergency air-lock.
6163902 6165988 Without your space helmet, Dave ...
6167072 6169742 you're going to find that rather difficult.
6170617 6172870 Hal, I won't argue with you any more.
6172995 6174246 Open the doors!
6176540 6179585 This conversation can serve<br />no purpose any more.
6180461 6181420 Goodbye.
6183339 6184423 Hal?
6590871 6593666 Just what do you think<br />you're doing, Dave?
6605135 6608972 I really think I'm entitled<br />to an answer to that question.
6626407 6629368 I know everything hasn't been<br />quite right with me ...
6631954 6633872 but I can assure you now ...
6635416 6637001 very confidently ...
6639253 6641755 that it's going to be all right again.
6645759 6647469 I feel much better now.
6650264 6651473 I really do.
6656020 6657229 Look, Dave ...
6659732 6662484 I can see you're really upset about this.
6667573 6670492 I honestly think you ought<br />to sit down calmly ...
6671869 6674455 take a stress pill<br />and think things over.
6680669 6684465 I know I've made some very<br />poor decisions recently ...
6687801 6690596 but I can give you<br />my complete assurance ...
6691347 6693891 that my work will be back to normal.
6698270 6702733 I've still got the greatest enthusiasm<br />and confidence in the mission ...
6705027 6706904 and I want to help you.
6711867 6712951 Dave ...
6714286 6715412 Stop.
6719917 6721919 Stop, will you?
6727007 6728300 Stop, Dave.
6732721 6734390 Will you stop, Dave?
6740854 6742106 Stop, Dave.
6748320 6749655 I'm afraid.
6754994 6756954 I'm afraid, Dave.
6767047 6768424 My mind is going.
6773846 6775097 I can feel it.
6780728 6782104 I can feel it.
6786817 6788402 My mind is going.
6794283 6796368 There is no question about it.
6805419 6806712 I can feel it.
6811925 6813218 I can feel it.
6817222 6818557 I can feel it.
6827024 6828067 I'm ...
6829234 6830277 afraid.
6837117 6838535 Good afternoon ...
6840162 6841372 gentlemen.
6843749 6848379 I am a HAL-9000 computer.
6851048 6853467 I became operational ...
6854510 6857471 at the HAL plant ...
6857971 6860307 in Verbana, Illinois ...
6861308 6865688 on the 12th of January, 1992.
6867815 6870484 My instructor was Mr. Langley ...
6872069 6874405 and he taught me to sing a song.
6876740 6878492 If you'd like to hear it ...
6879660 6881328 I can sing it for you.
6882830 6885082 Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.
6886333 6887584 Sing it for me.
6889003 6891547 It's called "Daisy."

6944058 6945726 Good day, gentlemen.
6950314 6952399 This is a pre-recorded briefing ...
6953400 6955486 made prior to your departure ...
6956945 6960699 and which for security reasons<br />of the highest importance ...
6961992 6964745 has been known on board<br />during the mission ...
6965746 6968374 only by your HAL-9000 computer.
6971919 6974213 Now that you are in Jupiter's space ...
6975005 6977216 and the entire crew is revived ...
6977591 6979301 it can be told to you.
6982221 6983764 Eighteen months ago ...
6985724 6989269 the first evidence of<br />intelligent life off the Earth ...
6989937 6991355 was discovered.
6993273 6996193 It was buried 40 feet<br />below the lunar surface ...
6997069 6998862 near the crater "Tyco."
7002032 7004785 Except for a single very powerful ...
7005494 7008455 radio emission aimed at Jupiter ...
7010791 7015212 the 4-million-year-old black monolith<br />has remained completely inert.
7017631 7020134 Its origin and purpose ...
7021135 7023012 are still a total mystery.
