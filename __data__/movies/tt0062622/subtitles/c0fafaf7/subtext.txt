1551760 1553720 [RECEPTIONIST] Good morning, sir.<br />[FLOYD] Morning.

1557182 1559601 - Did you have a pleasant flight?<br />- Very nice.
1559809 1562938 Mr. Miller of Station Security<br />is supposed to meet me.
1563146 1565649 - May I call him for you?<br />- Would you? Here he is.
1565857 1567257 - Hello, Dr. Floyd.<br />- Hello, Miller.
1567400 1569361 [MILLER] Sorry I'm late.<br />[FLOYD] That's all right.
1569569 1571529 [MILLER]<br />It's nice to have you back.
1571738 1573990 - Did you have a good flight?<br />- Very nice.
1574199 1576993 - Shall we go through?<br />- Would you please use number 17?
1577202 1579955 [MILLER] Thank you, Ms. Turner. This way.<br />[FLOYD] Thank you.

1608233 1611778 Thank you. You are cleared through<br />Voice print Identification.
1612570 1613822 Thank you.
1620745 1623915 [FLOYD] Have I got time for breakfast?<br />[MILLER] I think we can manage that.
1624124 1625208 [FLOYD]<br />How long have I got?
1625375 1627919 [MILLER] Your flight leaves<br />in an hour and 10 minutes.
1628086 1631548 I've reserved a table for you<br />in the Earth light Room.
1631756 1635010 It's been seven or eight months<br />since you were here, hasn't it?
1635218 1637304 [FLOYD]<br />Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.
1637512 1640098 [MILLER] I suppose you saw the work<br />on the new section?
1640265 1642809 [FLOYD] Coming along great, huh?<br />[MILLER] Yeah, it's fine.
1642976 1644019 [FLOYD]<br />Oh, wait.
1644185 1647856 I've got to make a couple calls.<br />I'll meet you in the restaurant.
1676676 1678720 - Dad?<br />- Hello.
1679971 1683391 Hi, squirt.<br />What are you doing?
1684934 1685977 Playing.
1686144 1687604 Where's Mummy?
1687854 1689314 Gone to shopping.
1689564 1692025 - Who's taking care of you?<br />- Rachel.
1692233 1695653 - May I speak to Rachel, please?<br />- She's gone to the bathroom.
1695904 1698615 Are you coming<br />to my party tomorrow?
1698865 1701284 I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.
1701701 1702869 Why not?
1703036 1705622 Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.
1706164 1708500 Very sorry about it, but I just can't.
1709626 1712670 I'm going to send you<br />a very nice present, though.
1714172 1715215 All right.
1715382 1717550 - Anything special that you want?<br />- Yes.
1717759 1718843 What?
1719177 1720637 A telephone.
1721179 1723348 We've got lots of telephones already.
1723556 1727894 Can't you think of anything else<br />for your birthday? Something special?
1728144 1729562 - Yes.<br />- What?
1729979 1731022 A bush baby.
1731189 1733733 A bush baby?<br />We'll have to see about that.
1733942 1737695 I want you to tell Mummy<br />something for me. Will you remember?
1737904 1740865 Tell Mummy that I telephoned. Okay?
1742450 1745328 And that I'll try<br />to telephone again tomorrow.
1745578 1747497 Now, will you tell her that?
1748248 1749290 Yes.
1749457 1752335 Okay, sweetheart.<br />Have a nice birthday tomorrow.
1752585 1753628 All right.
1753795 1756881 And have a nice birthday party<br />tomorrow too, huh?
1757674 1758716 All right.
1758883 1761511 Take care and be a good girl,<br />won't you?
1761761 1762971 All right. Bye-bye.
1763221 1765640 Bye-bye. Happy birthday.
1769727 1771813 [IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
1779404 1783741 [FLOYD] Elena, nice to see you again.<br />[ELENA] Heywood, what a surprise.
1783908 1786911 [FLOYD] You're looking wonderful.<br />[ELENA] You're looking well too.
1787078 1789122 [ELENA] This is my friend,<br />Dr. Heywood Floyd.
1789289 1791809 [ELENA] I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.<br />[FLOYD] How do you do?
1791958 1793835 [ELENA] Dr. Stretyneva.<br />[FLOYD] How do you do?
1794002 1795795 [ELENA]<br />And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.
1795962 1798381 [FLOYD] How do you do?<br />I've heard a lot about you.
1798631 1800133 [SMYSLOV]<br />Do sit down.
1800508 1802510 [FLOYD] Well, we...<br />[SMYSLOV] No, no, please.
1802927 1804387 [FLOYD]<br />Thank you.
1804554 1807599 [SMYSLOV] Would you like a drink?<br />[FLOYD] No, thank you.
1807765 1811102 I haven't had breakfast yet.<br />Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.
1811311 1813771 I'll just sit with you a moment.<br />Then I'll be off.
1813980 1816566 [SMYSLOV] Are you quite sure?<br />[FLOYD] Quite sure, thank you.
1817775 1819986 - Well, how's Gregor?<br />- He's fine.
1820236 1823531 He's been doing underwater research<br />in the Baltic...
1823781 1827827 so I'm afraid we don't see<br />very much of each other these days.
1828077 1831664 - When you see him, give him my regards.<br />- Yes, of course.
1831915 1834876 Well, where are you all off to?<br />Up or down?
1835084 1836127 We're going home.
1836336 1841216 We've spent three months calibrating<br />the new antenna at Tchalinko.
1841466 1844135 - What about you?<br />- I'm on my way to Clavius.
1844385 1845678 Oh, are you?
1848348 1851643 Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think<br />I'm being too inquisitive...
1851851 1856981 but perhaps you can clear up the big<br />mystery about what is going on there.
1857774 1859901 I'm afraid I don't know<br />what you mean.
1860151 1861861 For the past two weeks...
1862070 1865490 some extremely odd things<br />have been happening at Clavius.
1865740 1867825 - Oh, really?<br />- Yes, yes.
1868117 1872413 For one thing, when you phone the base,<br />all you get is a recording...
1872622 1876793 which repeats that the phone lines<br />are temporarily out of order.
1878336 1880797 Probably having some trouble<br />with their equipment.
1880964 1882131 Yes.
1882298 1887220 That's what we thought at first,<br />but it's been going on now for 10 days.
1887470 1890223 You haven't been able to<br />contact anyone for 10 days?
1890431 1891808 That's right.
1892100 1893142 Oh, I see.
1893309 1896980 There's another thing.<br />Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...
1897188 1900108 was denied permission<br />for an emergency landing.
1900316 1901359 That does sound odd.
1901526 1904737 I'm afraid there's going to be<br />a bit of a row about it.
1904988 1908866 Denying the men permission to land<br />violates the IAS Convention.
1909075 1911911 Yes, of course.<br />Did the crew get back all right?
1912120 1915582 - Fortunately, they did.<br />- Well, I'm glad about that.
1919168 1923131 At the risk of pressing you on<br />a point you seem reticent to discuss...
1923381 1925967 may I ask you<br />a straightforward question?
1926175 1927635 Well, certainly.
1930388 1934726 Frankly, we have had some<br />very reliable intelligence reports that...
1934976 1938354 quite a serious epidemic<br />has broken out at Clavius.
1938605 1942609 Something, apparently,<br />of an unknown origin.
1942859 1945236 Is this, in fact, what has happened?
1950491 1952577 I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...
1953953 1956664 I'm really not at liberty<br />to discuss this.
1958291 1959459 I understand.
1960918 1964130 But this epidemic<br />could easily spread to our base.
1964339 1966424 We should be given all the facts.
1966633 1968468 Yes, I know.
1971471 1974515 As I said,<br />I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
1977310 1980104 Won't you change your mind<br />about that drink?
1980313 1982649 No, I'm positive.<br />I really must be going.
1982899 1985943 I hope you and your wife come<br />to the IAC Conference.
1986152 1987487 I hope we can make it.
1987695 1990740 If you do, bring that darling<br />little daughter with you.
1990948 1994869 That'll depend on school vacations<br />and all that sort of thing.
1995119 1996162 If we can, we will.
1996371 1999290 You've got an invitation<br />if you ever get to the States.
1999499 2002251 Gregor and I will look forward<br />to seeing you.
2003211 2004253 Goodbye, Elena.
2004671 2007548 It's been a pleasure meeting you all.<br />Dr. Smyslov.
2007757 2011719 Whatever the reasons for your visit,<br />the very best of luck to you.
2011928 2012970 Thank you.
2013221 2014430 Ladies.

2192692 2194694 [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
2469426 2471428 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]
2489655 2491490 PHOTOGRAPHER:<br />Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.
2491657 2493951 I'm through now.<br />Thank you very much, gentlemen.
2494118 2495494 [HALVORSEN]<br />You're welcome.
2508132 2509300 [HALVORSEN]<br />Well...
2509800 2512595 I know you will all<br />want to join with me...
2512845 2516724 in welcoming our distinguished<br />friend and colleague...
2516932 2521145 from the National Council<br />of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.
2521395 2526525 Dr. Floyd has come up specially<br />to Clavius to be with us today.
2527818 2531155 Before the briefing, he'd like<br />to have a few words with you.
2531363 2532448 Dr. Floyd?
2545377 2547338 [FLOYD]<br />Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.
2547588 2550424 Hi, everybody.<br />Nice to be back with you.
2553719 2557306 First, I bring a personal message<br />from Dr. Howell...
2557556 2560351 who has asked me to convey<br />his deep appreciation...
2560601 2563687 for the many sacrifices<br />you've had to make.
2563938 2567775 And, of course, his congratulations<br />on your discovery...
2568317 2572947 which may prove to be among the most<br />significant in the history of science.
2575199 2576283 Now...
2577159 2581080 I know there have been some<br />conflicting views...
2581330 2584959 regarding the need for<br />complete security in this matter.
2585167 2588879 More specifically, your opposition<br />to the cover story...
2589296 2592841 created to give the impression<br />of an epidemic at the base.
2593884 2597846 I understand that beyond it being<br />a matter of principle...
2598472 2601934 many of you are troubled<br />by the concern and anxiety...
2602184 2607273 this story of an epidemic might cause<br />to your relatives and friends on Earth.
2608440 2611235 I completely sympathize<br />with your negative views.
2612528 2616198 I find this cover story<br />personally embarrassing, myself.
2616991 2621287 However, I accept the need<br />for absolute secrecy in this.
2621996 2623872 And I hope you will too.
2626500 2629336 I'm sure you're all aware<br />of the grave potential...
2629545 2632214 for cultural shock<br />and social disorientation...
2632423 2634800 contained in this situation...
2635009 2637511 if the facts were<br />prematurely made public...
2637720 2640806 without adequate preparation<br />and conditioning.
2641557 2642891 Anyway...
2643100 2645311 this is the view of the Council.
2646186 2650357 The purpose of my visit is to gather<br />additional facts and opinions...
2650566 2652276 on the situation...
2652735 2655654 and to prepare a report<br />to the Council...
2655904 2660993 recommending when and how<br />the news should eventually be announced.
2662244 2666040 If any of you would like to give me<br />your views and opinions...
2666290 2671253 in private, if you like, I will be<br />happy to include them in my report.
2673213 2675215 Well, I think that's about it.
2676008 2677509 Any questions?
2680095 2683223 Dr. Floyd, have you any idea<br />how much longer...
2683432 2686226 this cover story will<br />have to be maintained?
2688103 2689688 [FLOYD]<br />I don't know, Bill.
2690105 2694068 I suppose for as long as<br />deemed necessary by the Council.
2694276 2697029 There must be adequate time for<br />a full study...
2697279 2700908 before any thought can be given<br />to making a public announcement.
2701116 2704036 As some of you know,<br />the Council has requested...
2704244 2706955 that security oaths<br />be obtained in writing...
2707164 2710042 from everyone who has<br />knowledge of this event.
2712211 2713962 Were there any more questions?
2719676 2723138 [HALVORSEN] I'm sure<br />we want to cooperate with Dr. Floyd...
2723305 2724807 as fully as possible...
2725349 2730479 and as there are no more questions,<br />we ought to get on with the briefing.
2730854 2733357 [HALVORSEN] Thank you, Dr. Floyd.<br />[FLOYD] Thank you.
2830871 2832164 [MICHAELS]<br />Anybody hungry?
2834833 2837211 [FLOYD] What've we got?<br />[MICHAELS] You name it.
2841089 2843383 [FLOYD] Is this chicken?<br />[MICHAELS] Something like that.
2843550 2845385 [MICHAELS]<br />Tastes the same, anyway.
2846053 2847304 [HALVORSEN]<br />Got any ham?
2847513 2848972 [MICHAELS]<br />Ham, ham, ham...
2849181 2850807 [HALVORSEN]<br />There, that's it.
2854061 2855103 Look pretty good.
2855312 2858065 [MICHAELS] They're getting better at it<br />all the time.
2860108 2861985 [HALVORSEN]<br />That was an excellent speech.
2862152 2863403 [MICHAELS]<br />It certainly was.
2864238 2866323 I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.
2866532 2867824 Thanks, Ralph.
2868075 2870661 By the way,<br />you've both done a wonderful job.
2870869 2872454 I admire how<br />you've handled this.
2872663 2876208 [HALVORSEN] It's our job to do this thing<br />the way you want it done.
2876416 2879044 We're only too happy to<br />be able to oblige.
2879628 2881338 [MICHAELS]<br />Have you seen these yet?
2881630 2884967 [HALVORSEN] Have a look.<br />[MICHAELS] Here's what started it all.
2885592 2886885 [FLOYD]<br />Oh, yeah.
2887219 2888679 [HALVORSEN]<br />When we found it...
2888845 2890847 we thought<br />it might be magnetic rock...
2891056 2894184 but all the geological evidence<br />was against it.
2894434 2899064 And not even a nickel-iron meteorite<br />could produce a field this intense.
2899273 2900983 So we decided to have a look.
2901191 2903735 [MICHAELS] We thought it was<br />part of a buried structure...
2903902 2907614 so we excavated out,<br />but we didn't find anything else.
2907823 2910826 [HALVORSEN] And the evidence seems<br />pretty conclusive that...
2911034 2914162 it hasn't been covered<br />by erosion or other forces.
2914371 2916707 It's been deliberately buried.
2917708 2919626 Deliberately buried.
2923171 2924923 [MICHAELS]<br />How about a little coffee?
2925132 2927050 [FLOYD] Great.<br />[HALVORSEN] Good idea.
2932556 2935517 I don't suppose you have any idea<br />what the damn thing is?
2935767 2937686 [HALVORSEN]<br />I wish to hell we did.
2938061 2942274 The only thing we're sure of is<br />it was buried 4 million years ago.
2942649 2947112 Well, I must say, you guys have<br />certainly come up with something.
2947321 2948989 [MICHAELS]<br />Watch this, now. It's hot.

3533531 3534699 [NEWSCASTER]<br />Good evening.
3534866 3537869 Three weeks ago,<br />the American spacecraft Discovery One...
3538077 3540788 left on its half-billion-mile voyage<br />to Jupiter.
3541164 3544959 This marked the first manned attempt<br />to reach this distant planet.
3545210 3548671 This afternoon, The World Tonight<br />recorded an interview...
3548880 3553468 with the crew at a distance<br />of 80 million miles from Earth.
3553676 3556971 It took seven minutes for our words<br />to reach the giant spacecraft...
3557180 3560308 but this time delay has been edited<br />from this recording.
3560516 3563811 Our reporter Martin Amer<br />speaks to the crew.
3564020 3567190 [REPORTER] The crew of Discovery One<br />consists of five men...
3567398 3572362 and one of the latest generation<br />of the HAL 9000 computers.
3572612 3574906 Three of the men<br />were put aboard asleep...
3575114 3578284 or to be more precise,<br />in a state of hibernation.
3578493 3581412 They were Dr. Charles Hunter,<br />Dr. Jack Kim ball...
3581579 3583498 and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.
3583915 3586626 We spoke with mission commander,<br />Dr. David Bowman...
3586834 3589128 and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.
3589337 3592215 Good afternoon, gentlemen.<br />How is everything going?
3592423 3593633 [BOWMAN]<br />Marvelous.
3595301 3596970 We have no complaints.
3597220 3600473 I'm glad to hear that.<br />I'm sure the entire world...
3600682 3603935 joins me in wishing you<br />a safe, successful voyage.
3604102 3605979 [BOWMAN] Thanks very much.<br />[POOLE] Thank you.
3606396 3610358 Although hibernation has been used<br />on previous space efforts...
3610566 3615113 this is the first time men were<br />put into hibernation before departure.
3615321 3616614 Why was this done?
3616864 3620118 [BOWMAN] This was done to achieve<br />the maximum conservation...
3620326 3623871 of our life-support capabilities,<br />basically food and air.
3624080 3627709 The three hibernating crew members<br />represent the survey team.
3627959 3631713 Their efforts won't be utilized<br />until we approach Jupiter.
3632005 3635842 [REPORTER] Dr. Poole, what's it like<br />while you're in hibernation?
3636801 3640430 It's exactly like being asleep.<br />You have no sense of time.
3640638 3643099 The only difference is<br />that you don't dream.
3643308 3647395 [REPORTER] As I understand it, you only<br />breathe once a minute. Is this true?
3647603 3650231 [POOLE] Right, and the heart<br />beats three times a minute.
3650398 3654110 Body temperature is usually down to<br />about three degrees centigrade.
3654610 3657947 [REPORTER] The sixth member of the crew<br />was not concerned...
3658156 3660241 about the problems of hibernation...
3660450 3663911 for he was the latest result<br />in machine intelligence:
3664120 3668541 The HAL 9000 computer,<br />which can reproduce...
3668791 3671711 though some experts prefer<br />to use the word mimic...
3671919 3674297 most of the activities<br />of the human brain...
3674505 3678551 and with incalculably greater<br />speed and reliability.
3678760 3682347 We next spoke with<br />the HAL 9000 computer...
3682555 3685516 whom, we learned,<br />one addresses as Hal.
3686267 3688394 Hello, Hal.<br />How's everything going?
3688770 3692607 [HAL] Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.<br />Everything is going extremely well.
3692857 3696277 [REPORTER] Hal, you have an enormous<br />responsibility on this mission...
3696527 3700406 perhaps the greatest<br />of any single mission element.
3700615 3703409 You're the brain<br />and nervous system of the ship.
3703618 3707372 Your responsibilities include<br />watching over the men in hibernation.
3707580 3710666 Does this ever cause you<br />any lack of confidence?
3710875 3713169 [HAL]<br />Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.
3713461 3718132 The 9000 Series is<br />the most reliable computer ever made.
3718508 3723304 No 9000 computer has ever made<br />a mistake or distorted information.
3723971 3727225 We are all, by any practical<br />definition of the words...
3727475 3730853 fool proof and incapable of error.
3731104 3734899 [REPORTER] Hal, despite your enormous<br />intellect, are you ever frustrated...
3735108 3738194 by your dependence on people<br />to carry out actions?
3738444 3740655 [HAL]<br />Not in the slightest bit.
3740863 3742990 I enjoy working with people.
3743241 3747787 I have a stimulating relationship<br />with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.
3747954 3752250 My mission responsibilities range<br />over the entire operation of the ship...
3752667 3755628 so I am constantly occupied.
3755878 3759340 I am putting myself<br />to the fullest possible use...
3759549 3764303 which is all, I think, that any<br />conscious entity can ever hope to do.
3764929 3768141 [REPORTER] Dr. Poole, what's it like<br />living for most of the year...
3768391 3771227 in such close proximity with Hal?
3772228 3774188 [POOLE]<br />It's like what you said earlier.
3774439 3776566 He's like a sixth<br />member of the crew.
3776816 3780862 You quickly get adjusted to the idea<br />that he talks, and think of him...
3781112 3783114 really just as another person.
3783322 3787034 [REPORTER] In talking to the computer,<br />one gets the sense that he's capable...
3787201 3788578 of emotional responses.
3788828 3791164 When I asked him<br />about his abilities...
3791372 3795334 I sensed pride in his answer<br />about his accuracy and perfection.
3795585 3798963 Do you believe that Hal<br />has genuine emotions?
3799672 3802633 [BOWMAN] Well, he acts like<br />he has genuine emotions.
3802884 3806471 He's programmed that way<br />to make it easier for us to talk to him.
3806721 3808764 As to whether or not<br />he has feelings...
3808973 3811809 is something I don't think<br />anyone can truthfully answer.
3837126 3839003 [HAL]<br />Excuse me, Frank.
3839378 3840463 What is it, Hal?
3840630 3843591 [HAL] We've got the transmission<br />from your parents coming in.
3844800 3845885 Fine.
3846552 3848804 Put it on here, please.<br />Take me in a bit.
3849055 3850306 Certainly.
3863486 3865446 [DAD] Hello, Frank.<br />[MOM] Happy birthday, darling.
3865613 3867573 [DAD] Happy birthday.<br />Many happy returns.
3867782 3868950 [POOLE]<br />A bit higher, Hal.
3869116 3871536 [DAD] Mother and I are both<br />feeling wonderful.
3871786 3873621 Ray and Sally were going<br />to be here...
3873871 3876123 but Ray's back<br />went bad on him again.
3876374 3878501 How do you like your cake?
3878709 3880127 Sorry you can't join us.
3880378 3881963 I ran into Bob the other day.
3882213 3884257 He said to wish you happy birthday.
3884465 3887176 All my students<br />send their best wishes too.
3887385 3889095 They talk about you all the time.
3889345 3892431 You're a big celebrity<br />in the second grade.
3892682 3894100 [MOM]<br />We were on TV last week.
3894350 3896978 [DAD] Your mom and I<br />and Dave's parents were asked...
3897228 3899480 what we thought<br />of our illustrious sons.
3899730 3903067 Imagine what we told them.<br />It's being broadcast next Thursday.
3903317 3904902 Perhaps you can listen in.
3905069 3907071 [MOM]<br />We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.
3907238 3910950 I'll be glad to get the gift,<br />but tell me how much to spend.
3911158 3913995 [DAD] Oh, Frank,<br />about your AGS-19 payments...
3914245 3915871 I think I straightened it out.
3916038 3918207 I talked to<br />the accounting office yesterday...
3918374 3922962 and they said you'd be receiving<br />your higher rates of pay by next month.
3923212 3925339 I can't think of anything else to say.
3925590 3929719 [MOM] Give our love to Dave.<br />[DAD] Be sure to give him our regards.
3929969 3933306 [DAD] We wish you the very<br />happiest of birthdays.
3933556 3935141 All the best, son.
3935391 3937560 [MOM & DAD SING]<br />Happy birthday to you
3937810 3939895 Happy birthday to you
3940104 3942690 Happy birthday, dear Frank
3942898 3945526 Happy birthday to you.
3947278 3949322 [DAD]<br />See you next Wednesday.
3952450 3954327 [HAL]<br />Happy birthday, Frank.
3955161 3958706 Thank you, Hal.<br />A bit flatter, please.
3976682 3978726 [POOLE]<br />Anyway, queen takes pawn.
3980478 3982897 [HAL]<br />Bishop takes knight's pawn.
3984440 3985858 [POOLE]<br />Lovely move.
3990279 3991864 Rook to king one.
3992114 3994992 [HAL] I'm sorry, Frank.<br />I think you missed it.
3995660 3999163 Queen to bishop three.<br />Bishop takes queen.
3999372 4001874 Knight takes bishop. Mate.
4006128 4009298 [POOLE]<br />Looks like you're right. I resign.
4009465 4011467 [HAL]<br />Thank you for a very enjoyable game.
4011634 4012677 [POOLE]<br />Thank you.
4050673 4052758 [HAL] Good evening, Dave.<br />[BOWMAN] How are you, Hal?
4052925 4056345 Everything's running smoothly, you?<br />[BOWMAN] Not too bad.
4056554 4059223 - Have you been doing more work?<br />- A few sketches.
4059473 4061934 - May I see them?<br />- Sure.
4065938 4068399 That's a very nice rendering, Dave.
4069233 4071736 I think you've improved a great deal.
4072862 4075906 - Can you hold it a bit closer?<br />- Sure.
4078033 4080077 That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?
4083289 4084874 By the way...
4085583 4088627 do you mind if I ask you<br />a personal question?
4089128 4090755 No, not at all.
4091005 4093507 Well, forgive me<br />for being so inquisitive...
4095551 4097636 but lately I've wondered...
4097887 4101766 whether you might be having<br />second thoughts about the mission?
4101974 4103642 How do you mean?
4103893 4107813 Well, it's rather difficult to define.
4108814 4112401 Perhaps I'm just projecting<br />my own concern about it.
4113611 4117823 I know I've never completely<br />freed myself of the suspicion...
4118073 4122203 that there are some extremely<br />odd things about this mission.
4123204 4126582 I'm sure you'll agree<br />there's some truth in what I say.
4129460 4131670 That's a rather difficult<br />question to answer.
4131879 4134548 You don't mind talking about it,<br />do you, Dave?
4135508 4137468 No, not at all.
4138469 4141222 Certainly no one could<br />have been unaware of the very...
4141430 4144517 strange stories floating<br />around before we left.
4145434 4148896 Rumors about something<br />being dug up on the moon.
4150147 4153442 I never gave these stories<br />much credence...
4153651 4157822 but particularly in view of some<br />other things that have happened...
4158030 4160699 I find them difficult<br />to put out of my mind.
4161450 4162910 For instance...
4163160 4167456 the way all our preparations<br />were kept under such tight security.
4168123 4170960 And the melodramatic touch<br />of putting Drs. Hunter...
4171168 4173546 Kim ball and Kaminsky aboard...
4173796 4178843 already in hibernation, after four<br />months of training on their own.
4179635 4182263 You working up your crew<br />psychology report?
4183722 4185182 Of course I am.
4185599 4189353 Sorry about this.<br />I know it's a bit silly.
4190062 4191647 Just a moment.
4191897 4193274 Just a moment.
4194817 4199113 I've just picked up a fault<br />in the AE-35 unit.
4199822 4204368 It's going to go 100-percent failure<br />within 72 hours.
4206287 4209039 - Is it still within operational limits?<br />- Yes.
4209248 4211750 And it will stay that way<br />until it fails.
4212084 4214003 We have 72 hours till failure?
4214253 4218132 Yes. That's a completely<br />reliable figure.
4219925 4222553 Then we'll bring it in.<br />I'll go over it with Frank...
4222761 4226473 and get on to Mission Control.<br />Let me have the hard copy on it.
4309765 4312434 [CONTROLLER] X-ray delta one,<br />this is Mission Control.
4312685 4315521 Roger your two-zero-one-three.
4315771 4318232 Sorry you fellows are having<br />a bit of trouble.
4318440 4323570 We're reviewing telemetric information<br />in our simulator and will advise.
4323821 4328033 Roger your plan to go EVA<br />and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit...
4328242 4329910 prior to failure.
4358063 4360149 [BOWMAN]<br />Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.
4381670 4383505 Open the pod doors, Hal.
4795250 4797878 I'm damned if I can find<br />anything wrong with it.
4798795 4800172 [HAL]<br />Yes...
4801923 4803508 it's puzzling.
4804718 4808513 I don't think I've ever seen<br />anything quite like this before.
4812142 4814144 I would recommend...
4814352 4818523 that we put the unit back<br />in operation and let it fail.
4819232 4823111 It should then be a simple matter<br />to track down the cause.
4824362 4827491 We can certainly afford<br />to be out of communication...
4827699 4830827 for the short time<br />it will take to replace it.
4839544 4842297 [CONTROLLER] X-ray delta one,<br />this is Mission Control.
4842547 4845217 Roger your one-niner-three-zero.
4845425 4849846 We concur with your plan to replace<br />unit to check fault prediction.
4850096 4852724 We advise you that<br />our preliminary findings...
4852974 4855685 indicate that your on board<br />9000 computer...
4855936 4858104 is in error predicting the fault.
4858313 4861316 I say again, in error<br />predicting the fault.
4861566 4866071 I know this sounds rather incredible,<br />but this conclusion is based on...
4866279 4869574 the results from our twin<br />9000 computer.
4869824 4873161 We're sceptical, and we're running<br />cross-checking routines...
4873411 4876122 to determine reliability<br />of this conclusion.
4876373 4877958 Sorry about this little snag.
4878208 4881086 We'll get this info to you<br />as soon as we work it out.
4881294 4883463 X-ray delta one,<br />this is Mission Control.
4883672 4887133 Two-zero-four-nine.<br />Transmission concluded.
4891388 4894683 [HAL] I hope the two of you<br />are not concerned about this.
4894933 4896351 No, I'm not, Hal.
4896601 4898228 Are you quite sure?
4898478 4902148 - Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.<br />- Of course.
4903358 4906987 How do you account for the discrepancy<br />between you and the twin 9000?
4907237 4910824 Well, I don't think there is<br />any question about it.
4911074 4914369 It can only be<br />attributable to human error.
4915579 4918373 This sort of thing<br />has cropped up before...
4918707 4922168 and it has always<br />been due to human error.
4925672 4927382 Listen, Hal...
4927591 4929884 there's never been<br />any instance at all...
4930135 4933346 of a computer error<br />occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?
4933597 4935181 None whatsoever, Frank.
4935390 4939102 The 9000 Series has<br />a perfect operational record.
4939352 4943648 [POOLE] I know the wonderful<br />achievements of the 9000 Series, but...
4944858 4949904 Are you certain there's never been even<br />the most insignificant computer error?
4950155 4952115 None whatsoever, Frank.
4952490 4956161 Quite honestly, I wouldn't<br />worry myself about that.
4960624 4962834 Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.
4964294 4966796 Fine. Thanks very much.
4969341 4972344 I'm having trouble<br />with my transmitter in C-pod.
4972594 4975180 Would you come down<br />and take a look at it with me?
4975388 4976514 See you later, Hal.
4998161 5000163 [BOWMAN]<br />Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.
5008713 5010965 [POOLE]<br />What sort of trouble are you having?
5011216 5013927 [BOWMAN] I've been getting some<br />interference in D-channel.
5014094 5015553 [POOLE]<br />We'll have a look at it.
5021935 5023436 [BOWMAN]<br />Open the door, Hal.
5042455 5044290 [BOWMAN]<br />Rotate pod, please, Hal.
5057637 5059723 Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.
5068148 5070150 Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
5073027 5075155 Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
5077115 5078742 I don't think he can hear us.
5078992 5081202 Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
5082662 5084748 Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.
5087959 5089335 What do you think?
5089794 5093506 - I'm not sure. What do you think?<br />- I've got a bad feeling about him.
5093757 5096009 - You do?<br />- Yeah. Definitely.
5096259 5097469 Don't you?
5098678 5100388 I don't know. I think so.
5101306 5105518 He's right about the 9000 Series<br />having a perfect operational record.
5105727 5106770 They do.
5106936 5110440 Unfortunately, that sounds<br />a little like famous last words.
5110690 5114986 Still, it was his idea to carry out<br />the failure mode analysis.
5116321 5119574 It certainly indicates his<br />integrity and self-confidence.
5119908 5121868 If he were wrong, that would prove it.
5122076 5124370 It would be,<br />if he knew he was wrong.
5126915 5130835 I can't put my finger on it,<br />but I sense something strange about him.
5133213 5135673 There's no reason not<br />to put back the unit and...
5135924 5140470 - carry on with the failure analysis.<br />- No, no, I agree about that.
5140720 5141888 Let's get on with it.
5142138 5144808 Okay. But, look, Dave.
5145642 5148269 Say we put the unit back<br />and it doesn't fail?
5148478 5151689 That would pretty well wrap it up<br />as far as Hal is concerned.
5153399 5156903 - We'd be in very serious trouble.<br />- We would, wouldn't we?
5157153 5158780 What the hell can we do?
5161783 5165870 - We wouldn't have too many alternatives.<br />- We wouldn't have any alternatives.
5166663 5170667 [POOLE] Every aspect of ship<br />operations is under his control.
5171084 5172335 If he's malfunctioning...
5172585 5175672 I don't see any choice<br />but disconnection.
5179384 5180927 I'm afraid I agree with you.
5181177 5183054 There'd be nothing else to do.
5184722 5187141 [BOWMAN]<br />It'd be a bit tricky.
5187976 5190520 We'd have to cut his<br />higher brain functions...
5190770 5195483 without disturbing the purely<br />automatic and regulatory systems.
5196734 5198444 We'd have to<br />work out the details...
5198653 5201614 of continuing<br />underground-based computer control.
5202031 5206536 Yeah. That's far safer than<br />allowing Hal to continue to run things.
5207245 5209247 Another thing just occurred to me.
5210748 5213334 No 9000 computer has ever<br />been disconnected.
5213585 5215628 No 9000 computer<br />has ever fouled up.
5215879 5217380 That's not what I mean.
5219549 5221759 I'm not so sure<br />what he'd think about it.
5226264 5229267 [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
5580159 5582203 [BOWMAN]<br />Prepare G-pod for EVA, Hal.
5585289 5586624 Any contact with him yet?
5586874 5588668 [HAL]<br />The radio is still dead.
5588876 5591796 - Do you have a positive track on him?<br />- I have a good track.
5592046 5593464 Do you know what happened?
5593756 5596425 I'm sorry, Dave.<br />I don't have enough information.
5596676 5598261 Open the pod door, Hal.
5960080 5962124 [BEEPING NOISE]
6042162 6044540 [BOWMAN]<br />Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.
6052464 6054758 Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.
6060389 6062266 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
6065602 6067479 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
6068522 6070190 Do you read me, Hal?
6073360 6074987 Do you read me, Hal?
6077489 6079366 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
6081285 6083328 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
6083746 6085247 Do you read me, Hal?
6085497 6088250 [HAL]<br />Affirmative, Dave. I read you.
6091545 6093380 Open the pod-bay doors, Hal.
6094965 6098510 I'm sorry, Dave.<br />I'm afraid I can't do that.
6100929 6102723 What's the problem?
6103140 6106351 I think you know what the problem is<br />just as well as I do.
6106560 6108437 What are you talking about, Hal?
6109438 6113525 This mission is too important for me<br />to allow you to jeopardize it.
6114610 6116987 I don't know<br />what you're talking about, Hal.
6118989 6122951 I know that you and Frank<br />were planning to disconnect me...
6123160 6125954 and that's something<br />I cannot allow to happen.
6131251 6133128 Where did you get that idea, Hal?
6133670 6137800 Although you took very thorough<br />precautions in the pod...
6138050 6140260 against my hearing you...
6140677 6142971 I could see your lips move.
6155025 6156527 All right, Hal.
6159738 6162574 I'll go in through<br />the emergency air lock.
6164117 6166745 Without your space helmet, Dave...
6167246 6169706 you're going to find that<br />rather difficult.
6170874 6173001 Hal, I won't argue with you any more.
6173252 6174336 Open the doors.
6175087 6176338 Dave...
6176797 6181260 this conversation can serve<br />no purpose any more. Goodbye.
6183512 6184763 Hal?
6186014 6187099 Hal?
6189810 6190853 Hal?
6193105 6194147 Hal.
6195858 6196900 Hal.

6591127 6594381 [HAL] Just what do you think<br />you're doing, Dave?
6602931 6604182 Dave...
6605392 6609813 I really think I'm entitled<br />to an answer to that question.
6626705 6630250 I know everything hasn't been<br />quite right with me...
6632210 6634629 but I can assure you now...
6635714 6637757 very confidently...
6639509 6642554 that it's going to be<br />all right again.
6646057 6648143 I feel much better now.
6650478 6652522 I really do.
6656276 6657986 Look, Dave...
6659946 6663199 I can see you're<br />really upset about this.
6667829 6671541 I honestly think you<br />ought to sit down calmly...
6672167 6675503 take a stress pill<br />and think things over.
6680925 6685305 I know I've made some<br />very poor decisions recently...
6688058 6691394 but I can give you<br />my complete assurance...
6691644 6694689 that my work will be back to normal.
6698651 6703782 I've still got the greatest enthusiasm<br />and confidence in the mission...
6705325 6707619 and I want to help you.
6712082 6713458 Dave...
6714584 6715960 stop.
6720215 6722842 Stop, will you?
6727097 6728890 Stop, Dave.
6732936 6735355 Will you stop, Dave?
6741069 6742862 Stop, Dave.
6748576 6750370 I'm afraid.
6755250 6757877 I'm afraid, Dave.
6763049 6764634 Dave.
6767303 6769556 My mind is going.
6774102 6775812 I can feel it.
6781317 6783111 I can feel it.
6787073 6789159 My mind is going.
6794539 6797292 There is no question about it.
6805633 6807510 I can feel it.
6812182 6814058 I can feel it.
6817479 6819397 I can feel it.
6827280 6828573 I'm...
6829491 6830867 afraid.
6837373 6839417 Good afternoon...
6840418 6842128 gentlemen.
6844005 6849135 I am a HAL 9000 computer.
6851304 6854432 I became operational...
6854807 6858645 at the HAL plant...
6858853 6861105 in Urbana, Illinois...
6861606 6866528 on the 12th of January, 1992.
6868071 6871741 My instructor was Mr. Langley...
6872367 6875286 and he taught me to sing a song.
6876996 6879457 If you'd like to hear it...
6879916 6881584 I can sing it for you.
6883086 6885922 Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.
6886589 6888007 Sing it for me.
6889259 6892804 It's called Daisy.
6894722 6895974 [HAL SINGS]<br />Daisy
6897559 6898977 Daisy
6901145 6904232 Give me your answer, do
6906651 6911239 I'm half crazy
6913032 6915910 All for the love of you
6918204 6919414 It won't be
6919872 6922333 A stylish marriage
6924252 6928339 I can't afford a carriage
6930633 6933052 But you'll look sweet
6933928 6936472 Upon the seat
6937807 6942604 Of a bicycle built for two
6944355 6945982 [MALE VOICE]<br />Good day, gentlemen.
6950612 6953072 This is a pre-recorded briefing...
6953656 6955366 made prior to your departure...
6957118 6961331 and which, for security reasons<br />of the highest importance...
6962290 6965793 has been known on board<br />during the mission...
6966044 6969756 only by your HAL 9000 computer.
6972216 6975011 Now that you are in Jupiter's space...
6975261 6977722 and the entire crew is revived...
6977972 6979766 it can be told to you.
6982518 6984771 Eighteen months ago...
6985772 6989984 the first evidence<br />of intelligent life off the Earth...
6990193 6991653 was discovered.
6993529 6997075 It was buried 40 feet<br />below the lunar surface...
6997325 6999577 near the crater Tycho.
7002372 7005458 Except for a single, very powerful...
7005708 7009587 radio emission aimed at Jupiter...
7010838 7015843 the 4-million-year-old monolith<br />has remained completely inert...
7017762 7020848 its origin and purpose...
7021265 7023017 still a total mystery.
