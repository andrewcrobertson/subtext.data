1537619 1539746 Here you are, sir. Main level, please.
1541156 1542714 Right. See you on the way back.
1542891 1543755 - Bye.<br />- Bye.
1545994 1547325 - Good morning, sir.<br />- Good morning.
1547462 1549327 We haven't seen you up here<br />for a long time.
1549397 1550796 No. Very nice to see you again.
1550865 1553356 - Did you have a pleasant flight, sir?<br />- Yes, very nice, thanks.
1553435 1556302 I think Mr. Miller of Station Security<br />is supposed to be meeting me.
1556371 1557736 May I call him for you?
1557806 1559205 Would you, please? Here he is!
1559274 1561071 - Hello, Dr. Floyd.<br />- Hello, Miller! How are you?
1561142 1563133 - Sorry I'm late.<br />- That's all right. You look great.
1563211 1565304 Thank you. It's nice to have you back.
1565380 1567814 - Did you have a good flight?<br />- Very nice indeed.
1567882 1569349 - Well, shall we go through?<br />- Okay.
1569417 1570884 Will you please use Number 17?
1570952 1572681 - Thank you, Miss Turner.<br />- Thank you.
1572754 1573812 This way.

1696745 1699179 Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.
1699447 1701813 Very sorry about it, but I just can't!
1703284 1706082 I'm gonna send you<br />a very nice present, though.

1724839 1727535 A bush baby?<br />Well, we'll have to see about that.

1755403 1756768 <i>All right. Bye-bye!</i>
1756838 1759398 Bye-bye! Happy birthday.
1772954 1774945 Elena, how nice to see you again.
1775023 1777355 What a wonderful surprise<br />to meet you here!
1777425 1780656 - You're looking wonderful.<br />- Thank you. You're looking well, too.
1780728 1782821 This is my good friend, Dr. Heywood Floyd.
1782897 1785365 - I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.<br />- How do you do?
1785433 1787560 - Dr. Stretyneva.<br />- How do you do?
1787635 1789500 And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.
1789571 1792199 How do you do? I've heard a lot about you.
1792273 1793740 Won't you sit down?
1794142 1796007 - Well, we...<br />- No, no, please.
1796544 1798011 Well, thank you.
1798279 1801180 - Would you like a drink, Doctor?<br />- No, thank you.
1801249 1804844 I haven't had breakfast yet.<br />Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.
1804919 1807547 I'll just sit with you a few minutes<br />and then I must be off.
1807622 1810648 - Are you quite sure?<br />- I'm quite sure, thank you.
1811359 1813486 - And how's Gregor?<br />- He's fine.
1813828 1817195 He's been doing some underwater research<br />in the Baltic so...
1817365 1821461 ...l'm afraid we don't get a chance<br />to see very much of each other these days.
1821703 1823466 When you do see him,<br />give him my regards, huh?
1823538 1824903 Yes, of course.
1825573 1828133 Well, where are you all off to?<br />Up or down?
1828276 1829834 Oh, we're going home.
1829978 1834210 We have just spent three months<br />calibrating the new antennae at Tchalinko.
1835083 1837916 - And what about you?<br />- I'm just on my way up to Clavius.
1837986 1839385 Oh, are you?
1841990 1845448 Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think<br />I'm being too inquisitive, but...
1845527 1847893 ...perhaps you can clear up<br />the great big mystery...
1847962 1850157 ...about what is going on up there.
1851566 1853659 I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
1853735 1855669 Oh, it's just that for the past two weeks...
1855737 1858865 ...some extremely odd things<br />have been happening at Clavius.
1859407 1861068 - Oh, really?<br />- Yes, yes.
1861776 1866110 For one thing, whenever you phone<br />the base all you get is a recording which...
1866281 1870411 ...repeats that the phone lines<br />are temporarily out of order.
1871986 1875888 Probably having some trouble with<br />their equipment or something like that.
1875957 1878016 That's what we thought<br />was the explanation at first...
1878092 1881027 ...but it has been going on now<br />for the past ten days.
1881229 1884062 You have not been able to contact anyone<br />for the past ten days?
1884132 1885394 That's right.
1885667 1886725 Oh, I see.
1887001 1888593 And there's another thing, Heywood.
1888670 1891161 Two days ago, one of our rocket buses<br />was denied permission...
1891239 1893707 ...for an emergency landing at Clavius.
1893975 1895101 That does sound odd.
1895176 1898543 Yes, yes. I'm afraid there's going to be<br />a bit of a row about that.
1898613 1902572 Denying the men permission to land is<br />a direct violation of the I.A.S. Convention.
1902650 1904675 Yes, of course. Of course.
1904752 1907186 - Did the crew get back all right?<br />- Yes, fortunately they did.
1907255 1908882 Well, I'm glad about that.
1912794 1916787 At the risk of pressing you<br />on a point you seem reticent to discuss...
1917065 1919659 ...may I ask you<br />a straightforward question?
1919867 1921198 Well, certainly.
1924038 1928065 Quite frankly, we have had some<br />very reliable intelligence reports that...
1928576 1931807 ...quite a serious epidemic<br />has broken out on Clavius.
1932313 1935077 Something, apparently,<br />of an unknown origin.
1936417 1938715 Is this, in fact, what has happened?
1944125 1946093 I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...
1947629 1950325 ...l'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
1951899 1953093 I understand.
1954235 1957727 But this epidemic could quite easily<br />spread to our base.
1957805 1960137 We should be given all the facts, Dr. Floyd.
1960208 1962176 Yes, I know.
1965046 1967606 As I said, I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
1970952 1973887 Now, are you sure you won't<br />change your mind about that drink?
1973955 1976423 No, I'm positive.<br />Now, I really must be going.
1976491 1979722 I hope that you and your wife can come<br />to the I.A.C. Conference in June.
1979794 1981227 We're gonna try. Hope we can make it.
1981295 1984560 And if you do, you remember to bring<br />that darling little daughter with you!
1984632 1988625 Well, that will all depend on<br />school vacations and all that sort of thing.
1988703 1989931 But if we can, we will.
1990004 1992370 Don't forget you have a standing invitation<br />if you ever get to the States.
1992440 1995807 No, of course not. Gregor and I will<br />look forward to seeing you.
1996277 1997869 Well, goodbye, Elena.
1998379 2001280 It has been a pleasure meeting you all,<br />Dr. Smyslov.
2001349 2005342 Whatever the reasons for your visit<br />to Clavius, the very best of luck to you.
2005420 2006546 Thank you.
2006754 2007812 Ladies.
2483497 2485021 Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.
2485099 2487090 I'm through now.<br />Thank you very much, gentlemen.
2487168 2488601 You're welcome.
2501615 2502639 Well...
2503217 2507620 I know you will all want to join with me<br />in welcoming our...
2508656 2510317 ...distinguished friend and colleague...
2510491 2514325 ...from the National Council<br />of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.
2515062 2519795 Dr. Floyd has come up specially to Calvius<br />to be with us today.
2521335 2524793 And before the briefing I know<br />he'd like to have a few words with you.
2524872 2525998 Dr. Floyd?
2538852 2541082 Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.
2541155 2542486 Hi, everybody.
2542590 2544581 Nice to be back again.
2547261 2550719 First of all, I bring a personal message<br />from Dr. Howell who...
2551065 2554159 ...has asked me to convey<br />his deepest appreciation to all of you...
2554235 2557102 ...for the many sacrifices<br />you have had to make.
2557438 2560737 And, of course, his congratulations<br />on your discovery...
2561875 2566141 ...which may well prove to be among the<br />most significant in the history of science.
2568749 2569875 Now...
2570618 2574452 ...I know there have been some<br />conflicting views held by some of you...
2574855 2578154 ...regarding the need<br />for complete security in this matter.
2578692 2581923 More specifically, your opposition<br />to the cover story...
2582930 2586889 ...created to give the impression<br />that there is an epidemic at the base.
2587468 2590733 I understand that beyond it being<br />a matter of principle...
2591905 2595602 ...many of you are troubled<br />by the concern and anxiety...
2595709 2600078 ...this story of an epidemic might cause<br />to your relatives and friends on Earth.
2601115 2604278 Well, I completely sympathize<br />with your negative views.
2605986 2609046 I find this cover story<br />personally embarrassing myself.
2610457 2614223 However, I accept the need<br />for absolute secrecy in this.
2615596 2617461 And I hope you will, too.
2620034 2623060 Now, I'm sure you are all aware<br />of the extremely grave potential...
2623137 2625867 ...for cultural shock<br />and social disorientation...
2625939 2627998 ...contained in this present situation...
2628442 2631036 ...if the facts were prematurely<br />and suddenly made public...
2631111 2633602 ...without adequate preparation<br />and conditioning.
2635949 2638315 Anyway, this is the view of the Council.
2639620 2643522 The purpose of my visit here is<br />to gather additional facts and opinions...
2643924 2645482 ...on the situation...
2646293 2648853 ...and to prepare a report to the Council...
2649396 2651364 ...recommending when and how...
2652433 2654628 ...the news should eventually<br />be announced.
2655769 2659466 Now, if any of you would like to give me<br />your views and opinions...
2659740 2664074 ...in private if you like, I will be only<br />too happy to include them in my report.
2666647 2668581 Well, I think that's about it.
2669483 2670848 Any questions?
2673587 2677853 Dr. Floyd, have you any idea<br />how much longer this cover story...
2677958 2679926 ...will have to be maintained?
2681628 2683061 I don't know, Bill.
2683530 2687660 I suppose it will be maintained as long as<br />is deemed necessary by the Council.
2687801 2690861 There must be adequate time for<br />a full study to be made on the situation...
2690938 2694499 ...before any thought can be given<br />to making a public announcement.
2694575 2698170 Oh, yes, as some of you already know,<br />the Council has requested...
2698245 2700611 ...that formal security oaths are<br />to be obtained in writing...
2700681 2703377 ...from everyone who has any knowledge<br />of this event.
2705652 2707779 Are there any more questions?
2713494 2717794 I'm sure we all want to cooperate<br />with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible...
2719233 2721861 ...and as there seems<br />to be no more questions...
2722403 2724132 ...I think we ought to get on<br />with the briefing.
2724204 2726331 - Thank you, Dr. Floyd.<br />- Thank you.
2824271 2825761 Anybody hungry?
2828242 2830210 - What we've got?<br />- You name it.
2834848 2836816 - What's this? Chicken?<br />- Something like that.
2836884 2838181 Tastes the same, anyway.
2839520 2840748 Any ham?
2840888 2842549 Ham, ham, ham...
2847628 2851689 - Looks pretty good.<br />- They're getting better at it all the time.
2853634 2855534 That was an excellent speech<br />you gave us, Heywood.
2855602 2856899 It certainly was.
2857571 2859835 I'm sure it beefed up morale a hell of a lot.
2859907 2861204 Thanks, Ralph.
2861475 2864137 I want to say to both of you<br />that I think you've done a wonderful job.
2864211 2865610 I appreciate the way<br />you've handled this thing.
2865679 2869615 Well, the way we look at it, it's our job<br />to do this thing the way you want it done.
2869683 2872481 And we're only too happy<br />to be able to oblige.
2873153 2874711 Have you seen these yet?
2874788 2876085 Take a look at them.
2876156 2878454 Here's what started the whole thing.
2878992 2880584 Oh, yes.
2880827 2884354 When we first found it, we thought<br />it might be an outcrop of magnetic rock...
2884431 2887832 ...but all the geological evidence<br />was against it.
2887901 2892565 And not even a big nickel iron meteorite<br />could produce a field as intense as this.
2892739 2894468 So, we decided to have a look.
2894541 2897135 We thought it might be<br />the upper part of some buried structure...
2897210 2898802 ...so we excavated out on all sides.
2898879 2901040 But, unfortunately,<br />we didn't find anything else.
2901114 2904242 And what's more, the evidence seems<br />pretty conclusive that...
2904318 2907253 ...it has not been covered up<br />by natural erosion or other forces.
2907321 2910154 It seems to have been deliberately buried.
2911091 2912558 Deliberately buried.
2916897 2918228 How about a little coffee?
2918298 2920562 - Great.<br />- Good idea.
2925772 2928900 I don't suppose you have any idea<br />what the damn thing is, huh?
2928976 2930841 I wish to hell we did.
2931478 2935209 No, the only thing we're sure of is<br />it was buried four million years ago.
2935983 2940044 Well, I must say, you guys have certainly<br />come up with something.
3526406 3527498 <i>Good evening</i>.
3527907 3531070 <i>Three weeks ago, the American spacecraft,</i><br /><i>Discovery One</i>...

3576923 3579721 <i>We spoke with Mission Commander,</i><br /><i>Dr. David Bowman</i>...
3579792 3582090 ...<i>and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole</i>.
3582328 3585354 <i>Well, good afternoon, gentlemen</i>.<br /><i>How is everything going?</i>
3585431 3589128 <i>Marvelous. We have no</i>...<br /><i>we have no complaints</i>.
3590169 3593661 <i>Well, I'm very glad to hear that</i><br /><i>and I'm sure that the entire world</i>...
3593740 3597198 ...<i>would join me in wishing you</i><br /><i>a safe and successful voyage</i>.
3597310 3599301 - <i>Thanks very much</i>.<br />- <i>Thank you</i>.
3599445 3603245 <i>Although hibernation has been used</i><br /><i>on previous space efforts</i>...
3603549 3607952 ...<i>this is the first time that men have been</i><br /><i>put into hibernation before departure</i>.
3608021 3609386 <i>Why was this done?</i>
3609856 3613314 <i>Well, this was done in order to achieve</i><br /><i>the maximum conservation</i>...
3613393 3616794 ...<i>of our life-support capabilities,</i><br /><i>basically food and air</i>.
3617063 3620555 <i>Now, the three hibernating crew members</i><br /><i>represent the survey team</i>.
3621000 3624731 <i>And their efforts won't be utilized</i><br /><i>until we are approaching Jupiter</i>.
3624971 3628270 <i>Dr. Poole, what's it like</i><br /><i>while you are in hibernation?</i>
3629909 3633538 <i>It's exactly like being asleep;</i><br /><i>you have absolutely no sense of time</i>.
3633613 3636047 <i>The only difference is you don't dream</i>.
3636249 3639082 <i>As I understand it,</i><br /><i>you only breathe once a minute</i>.
3639152 3640414 <i>Is this true?</i>
3640620 3641644 <i>That's right</i>.
3641721 3644713 <i>And your heart beats three times a minute,</i><br /><i>body temperature is usually down</i>...
3644791 3646884 ...<i>to about three degrees centigrade</i>.
3647493 3651020 <i>The sixth member of the Discovery crew</i><br /><i>was not concerned</i>...
3651130 3653291 ...<i>about the problems of hibernation</i>.
3653399 3656425 <i>For he was the latest result</i><br /><i>in machine intelligence</i>.
3657036 3661405 <i>The HAL-9000 computer</i><br /><i>which can reproduce</i>...
3661808 3664868 ...<i>though some experts still prefer</i><br /><i>to use the word "mimic"</i>...
3664944 3669904 ...<i>most of the activities of the human brain</i><br /><i>and with incalculably greater speed</i>...
3670016 3671449 ...<i>and reliability</i>.
3671684 3675279 <i>We next spoke</i><br /><i>with the HAL-9000 computer</i>...
3675555 3678319 ...<i>whom, we learned, one addresses as Hal</i>.
3679192 3681626 <i>Good afternoon, Hal</i>.<br /><i>How's everything going?</i>
3681694 3685391 <i>Good afternoon, Mr. Amer</i>.<br /><i>Everything's going extremely well</i>.
3685832 3688733 <i>Hal, you have an enormous responsibility</i><br /><i>on this mission</i>.
3688801 3691361 <i>In many ways,</i><br /><i>perhaps the greatest responsibility</i>...
3691437 3693405 ...<i>of any single mission element</i>.
3693473 3696533 <i>You are the brain</i><br /><i>and central nervous system of the ship</i>.
3696609 3700511 <i>Your responsibilities include</i><br /><i>watching over the men in hibernation</i>.
3700580 3703447 <i>Does this ever cause you</i><br /><i>any lack of confidence?</i>
3703783 3705910 <i>Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer</i>.
3706386 3710322 <i>The 9000 Series is</i><br /><i>the most reliable computer ever made</i>.
3711424 3715793 <i>No 9000 computer has ever made</i><br /><i>a mistake or distorted information</i>.
3716929 3720057 <i>We are all by any practical definition</i><br /><i>of the words</i>...
3720400 3723198 ...<i>foolproof and incapable of error</i>.
3723970 3728031 <i>Hal, despite your enormous intellect,</i><br /><i>are you ever frustrated</i>...
3728107 3730905 ...<i>by your dependence on people</i><br /><i>to carry out actions?</i>
3731411 3733106 <i>Not in the slightest bit</i>.
3733846 3735643 <i>I enjoy working with people</i>.
3736215 3740242 <i>I have a stimulating relationship</i><br /><i>with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman</i>.
3740920 3745323 <i>My mission responsibilities range</i><br /><i>over the entire operation of the ship</i>...
3745658 3747649 ...<i>so I am constantly occupied</i>.
3748795 3751889 <i>I am putting myself</i><br /><i>to the fullest possible use</i>...
3752498 3757094 ...<i>which is all, I think, that</i><br /><i>any conscious entity can ever hope to do</i>.
3757737 3761173 <i>Dr. Poole, what's it like living</i><br /><i>for the better part of a year</i>...
3761240 3763401 ...<i>in such close proximity with Hal?</i>
3764977 3767172 <i>It's pretty close to what you said</i><br /><i>about him earlier</i>.
3767246 3769476 <i>He's just like the sixth member</i><br /><i>of the crew</i>.
3769549 3773645 <i>You very quickly get adjusted to the idea</i><br /><i>that he talks. You think of him</i>...
3773853 3775912 ...<i>really as just another person</i>.
3776055 3779889 <i>In talking to the computer</i><br /><i>one gets the sense that he is capable</i>...
3780026 3781516 ...<i>of emotional response</i>.
3781594 3783960 <i>For example, when I asked him</i><br /><i>about his abilities</i>...
3784030 3787966 ...<i>I sensed a certain pride in his answer</i><br /><i>about his accuracy and perfection</i>.
3788334 3791098 <i>Do you believe that Hal</i><br /><i>has genuine emotions?</i>
3792505 3795531 <i>Oh, yes. Well, he acts</i><br /><i>like he has genuine emotions</i>.
3795641 3799407 <i>Of course, he's programmed that way</i><br /><i>to make it easier for us to talk to him</i>.
3799479 3801743 <i>But, as to whether or not</i><br /><i>he has real feelings</i>...
3801814 3805147 ...<i>is something I don't think anyone</i><br /><i>can truthfully answer</i>.
3829876 3831400 <i>Excuse me, Frank</i>.
3832144 3833304 What is it, Hal?
3833379 3836246 <i>We've got the transmission</i><br /><i>from your parents coming in</i>.
3839285 3841753 Put it on here, please. Take me in a bit.
3841888 3843583 <i>Certainly</i>.
3856502 3857969 - <i>Hello, Frank</i>.<br />- <i>Happy birthday, darling</i>.
3858037 3860301 <i>Happy birthday</i>.<br /><i>Many happy returns of the day</i>.
3860373 3861863 A bit higher, please.
3861941 3864501 <i>Now, Mother and I are both</i><br /><i>feeling wonderful, too</i>.
3864577 3866238 <i>Ray and Sally were going to be here, too</i>...
3866312 3869076 ...<i>but at the last minute</i><br /><i>Ray's back went bad on him again</i>.
3869148 3870615 <i>How do you like your cake, dear?</i>
3870683 3873083 <i>Looks great, doesn't it?</i><br /><i>Sorry you can't be with us</i>.
3873152 3875052 <i>Oh, I ran into Bob the other day</i>.
3875154 3877145 <i>He said to be sure</i><br /><i>and wish you a happy birthday</i>.
3877223 3880124 <i>All my students made me promise</i><br /><i>to send their best wishes, too</i>.
3880192 3882023 <i>You know they talk about you</i><br /><i>all the time in the classroom</i>.
3882161 3884721 <i>You're a big celebrity in the second grade</i>.
3885464 3886954 <i>You know we were on television</i><br /><i>last week?</i>
3887099 3890125 <i>Oh, yes! Your mother and I</i><br /><i>and Dave's parents were interviewed</i>...
3890202 3892500 ...<i>about what we thought of</i><br /><i>our illustrious son</i>.
3892572 3896167 <i>You can imagine what we told them</i>.<br /><i>I think it's being broadcast next Thursday</i>.
3896242 3897937 <i>Perhaps you'll be able to listen in</i>.
3898010 3899978 <i>Oh, we were thrilled</i><br /><i>about Elaine and Bill, dear</i>.
3900046 3903914 <i>I'll be glad to get the present for you,</i><br /><i>but please tell me how much to spend</i>.
3903983 3906952 <i>Oh, yes, Frank,</i><br /><i>about your AGS-19 payments</i>...
3907053 3908816 <i>I think I straightened it out for you</i>.
3908888 3911152 <i>I talked to the Accounting Office</i><br /><i>in Houston yesterday</i>...
3911223 3915819 ...<i>and they said you should be receiving</i><br /><i>your higher rates of pay by next month</i>.
3916062 3918394 <i>Well, I can't think of anything else to say</i>.
