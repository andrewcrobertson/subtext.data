1541958 1544502 Here you are, sir.<br />Main level, please.
1545545 1547088 Right. See you on the way back.
1547255 1549049 - Bye.<br />- Bye.
1549758 1551718 - Good morning, sir.<br />- Morning.
1551885 1554971 - We haven't seen you for a long time.<br />- Nice to see you again.
1555180 1557599 - Did you have a pleasant flight?<br />- Very nice.
1557807 1560936 Mr. Miller of Station Security<br />is supposed to meet me.
1561144 1563647 - May I call him for you?<br />- Would you? Here he is.
1563855 1565190 - Hello, Dr. Floyd.<br />- Hello, Miller.
1565398 1567359 - Sorry I'm late.<br />- That's all right.
1567567 1569527 It's nice to have you back.
1569736 1571988 - Did you have a good flight?<br />- Very nice.
1572197 1574991 - Shall we go through?<br />- Would you please use number 17?
1575200 1577953 - Thank you, Ms. Turner. This way.<br />- Thank you.
1583500 1586002 <i>Welcome to Voiceprint Identification.</i>

1610568 1611820 Thank you.
1618743 1621913 - Have I got time for breakfast?<br />- I think we can manage that.
1622122 1623206 How long have I got?
1623373 1625917 Your flight leaves<br />in an hour and 10 minutes.
1626084 1629546 I've reserved a table for you<br />in the Earthlight Room.
1629754 1633008 It's been seven or eight months<br />since you were here, hasn't it?
1633216 1635302 Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.
1635510 1638096 I suppose you saw the work<br />on the new section?
1638263 1640807 - Coming along great, huh?<br />- Yeah, it's fine.
1640974 1642017 Oh, wait.
1642183 1645854 I've got to make a couple calls.<br />I'll meet you in the restaurant.
1674674 1676718 <i>- Dad?</i><br />- Hello.
1677969 1681389 Hi, squirt.<br />What are you doing?
1682932 1683975 <i>Playing.</i>
1684142 1685602 Where's Mummy?
1685852 1687312 <i>Gone to shopping.</i>
1687562 1690023 - Who's taking care of you?<br /><i>- Rachel.</i>
1690231 1693651 - May I speak to Rachel, please?<br /><i>- She's gone to the bathroom.</i>
1693902 1696613 <i>Are you coming<br />to my party tomorrow?</i>
1696863 1699282 I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.
1699699 1700867 <i>Why not?</i>
1701034 1703620 Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.
1704162 1706498 Very sorry about it, but I just can't.
1707624 1710668 I'm going to send you<br />a very nice present, though.
1712170 1713213 <i>All right.</i>
1713380 1715548 - Anything special that you want?<br /><i>- Yes.</i>
1715757 1716841 What?
1717175 1718635 <i>A telephone.</i>
1719177 1721346 We've got lots of telephones already.
1721554 1725892 Can't you think of anything else<br />for your birthday? Something special?
1726142 1727560 <i>- Yes.</i><br />- What?
1727977 1729020 <i>A bush baby.</i>
1729187 1731731 A bush baby?<br />We'll have to see about that.
1731940 1735693 I want you to tell Mummy<br />something for me. Will you remember?
1735902 1738863 Tell Mummy that I telephoned. Okay?
1740448 1743326 And that I'll try<br />to telephone again tomorrow.
1743576 1745495 Now, will you tell her that?
1746246 1747288 <i>Yes.</i>
1747455 1750333 Okay, sweetheart.<br />Have a nice birthday tomorrow.
1750583 1751626 <i>All right.</i>
1751793 1754879 And have a nice birthday party<br />tomorrow too, huh?
1755672 1756714 <i>All right.</i>
1756881 1759509 Take care and be a good girl,<br />won't you?
1759759 1760969 <i>All right. Bye-bye.</i>
1761219 1763638 Bye-bye. Happy birthday.
1777402 1781739 - Elena, nice to see you again.<br />- Heywood, what a surprise.
1781906 1784909 - You're looking wonderful.<br />- You're looking well too.
1785076 1787120 This is my friend,<br />Dr. Heywood Floyd.
1787287 1789789 - I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.<br />- How do you do?
1789956 1791833 - Dr. Stretyneva.<br />- How do you do?
1792000 1793793 And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.
1793960 1796379 How do you do?<br />I've heard a lot about you.
1796629 1798131 Do sit down.
1798506 1800508 - Well, we--<br />- No, no, please.
1800925 1802385 Thank you.
1802552 1805597 - Would you like a drink?<br />- No, thank you.
1805763 1809100 I haven't had breakfast yet.<br />Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.
1809309 1811769 I'll just sit with you a moment.<br />Then I'll be off.
1811978 1814564 - Are you quite sure?<br />- Quite sure, thank you.
1815773 1817984 - Well, how's Gregor?<br />- He's fine.
1818234 1821529 He's been doing underwater research<br />in the Baltic...
1821779 1825825 ...so I'm afraid we don't see<br />very much of each other these days.
1826075 1829662 - When you see him, give him my regards.<br />- Yes, of course.
1829913 1832874 Well, where are you all off to?<br />Up or down?
1833082 1834125 We're going home.
1834334 1839214 We've spent three months calibrating<br />the new antenna at Tchalinko.
1839464 1842133 - What about you?<br />- I'm on my way to Clavius.
1842383 1843676 Oh, are you?
1846346 1849641 Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think<br />I'm being too inquisitive...
1849849 1854979 ...but perhaps you can clear up the big<br />mystery about what is going on there.
1855772 1857899 I'm afraid I don't know<br />what you mean.
1858149 1859859 For the past two weeks...
1860068 1863488 ...some extremely odd things<br />have been happening at Clavius.
1863738 1865823 - Oh, really?<br />- Yes, yes.
1866115 1870411 For one thing, when you phone the base,<br />all you get is a recording...
1870620 1874791 ...which repeats that the phone lines<br />are temporarily out of order.
1876334 1878795 Probably having some trouble<br />with their equipment.
1878962 1880129 Yes.
1880296 1885218 That's what we thought at first,<br />but it's been going on now for 10 days.
1885468 1888221 You haven't been able to<br />contact anyone for 10 days?
1888429 1889806 That's right.
1890098 1891140 Oh, I see.
1891307 1894978 There's another thing.<br />Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...
1895186 1898106 ...was denied permission<br />for an emergency landing.
1898314 1899357 That does sound odd.
1899524 1902735 I'm afraid there's going to be<br />a bit of a row about it.
1902986 1906864 Denying the men permission to land<br />violates the IAS Convention.
1907073 1909909 Yes, of course.<br />Did the crew get back all right?
1910118 1913580 - Fortunately, they did.<br />- Well, I'm glad about that.
1917166 1921129 At the risk of pressing you on<br />a point you seem reticent to discuss...
1921379 1923965 ...may I ask you<br />a straightforward question?
1924173 1925633 Well, certainly.
1928386 1932724 Frankly, we have had some<br />very reliable intelligence reports that...
1932974 1936352 ...quite a serious epidemic<br />has broken out at Clavius.
1936603 1940607 Something, apparently,<br />of an unknown origin.
1940857 1943234 Is this, in fact, what has happened?
1948489 1950575 I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...
1951951 1954662 ...I'm really not at liberty<br />to discuss this.
1956289 1957457 I understand.
1958916 1962128 But this epidemic<br />could easily spread to our base.
1962337 1964422 We should be given all the facts.
1964631 1966466 Yes, I know.
1969469 1972513 As I said,<br />I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
1975308 1978102 Won't you change your mind<br />about that drink?
1978311 1980647 No, I'm positive.<br />I really must be going.
1980897 1983941 I hope you and your wife come<br />to the IAC Conference.
1984150 1985485 I hope we can make it.
1985693 1988738 If you do, bring that darling<br />little daughter with you.
1988946 1992867 That'll depend on school vacations<br />and all that sort of thing.
1993117 1994160 If we can, we will.
1994369 1997288 You've got an invitation<br />if you ever get to the States.
1997497 2000249 Gregor and I will look forward<br />to seeing you.
2001209 2002251 Goodbye, Elena.
2002669 2005546 It's been a pleasure meeting you all.<br />Dr. Smyslov.
2005755 2009717 Whatever the reasons for your visit,<br />the very best of luck to you.
2009926 2010968 Thank you.
2011219 2012428 Ladies.
2487653 2489488 Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.
2489655 2491949 I'm through now.<br />Thank you very much, gentlemen.
2492116 2493492 You're welcome.
2506130 2507298 Well...
2507798 2510593 ...I know you will all<br />want to join with me...
2510843 2514722 ...in welcoming our distinguished<br />friend and colleague...
2514930 2519143 ...from the National Council<br />of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.
2519393 2524523 Dr. Floyd has come up specially<br />to Clavius to be with us today.
2525816 2529153 Before the briefing, he'd like<br />to have a few words with you.
2529361 2530446 Dr. Floyd?
2543375 2545336 Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.
2545586 2548422 Hi, everybody.<br />Nice to be back with you.
2551717 2555304 First, I bring a personal message<br />from Dr. Howell...
2555554 2558349 ...who has asked me to convey<br />his deep appreciation...
2558599 2561685 ...for the many sacrifices<br />you've had to make.
2561936 2565773 And, of course, his congratulations<br />on your discovery...
2566315 2570945 ...which may prove to be among the most<br />significant in the history of science.
2573197 2574281 Now...
2575157 2579078 ...I know there have been some<br />conflicting views...
2579328 2582957 ...regarding the need for<br />complete security in this matter.
2583165 2586877 More specifically, your opposition<br />to the cover story...
2587294 2590839 ...created to give the impression<br />of an epidemic at the base.
2591882 2595844 I understand that beyond it being<br />a matter of principle...
2596470 2599932 ...many of you are troubled<br />by the concern and anxiety...
2600182 2605271 ...this story of an epidemic might cause<br />to your relatives and friends on Earth.
2606438 2609233 I completely sympathize<br />with your negative views.
2610526 2614196 I find this cover story<br />personally embarrassing, myself.
2614989 2619285 However, I accept the need<br />for absolute secrecy in this.
2619994 2621870 And I hope you will too.
2624498 2627334 I'm sure you're all aware<br />of the grave potential...
2627543 2630212 ...for cultural shock<br />and social disorientation...
2630421 2632798 ...contained in this situation...
2633007 2635509 ...if the facts were<br />prematurely made public...
2635718 2638804 ...without adequate preparation<br />and conditioning.
2639555 2640889 Anyway...
2641098 2643309 ...this is the view of the Council.
2644184 2648355 The purpose of my visit is to gather<br />additional facts and opinions...
2648564 2650274 ...on the situation...
2650733 2653652 ...and to prepare a report<br />to the Council...
2653902 2658991 ...recommending when and how<br />the news should eventually be announced.
2660242 2664038 If any of you would like to give me<br />your views and opinions...
2664288 2669251 ...in private, if you like, I will be<br />happy to include them in my report.
2671211 2673213 Well, I think that's about it.
2674006 2675507 Any questions?
2678093 2681221 Dr. Floyd, have you any idea<br />how much longer...
2681430 2684224 ...this cover story will<br />have to be maintained?
2686101 2687686 I don't know, Bill.
2688103 2692066 I suppose for as long as<br />deemed necessary by the Council.
2692274 2695027 There must be adequate time for<br />a full study...
2695277 2698906 ...before any thought can be given<br />to making a public announcement.
2699114 2702034 As some of you know,<br />the Council has requested...
2702242 2704953 ...that security oaths<br />be obtained in writing...
2705162 2708040 ...from everyone who has<br />knowledge of this event.
2710209 2711960 Were there any more questions?
2717674 2721136 I'm sure<br />we want to cooperate with Dr. Floyd...
2721303 2722805 ...as fully as possible...
2723347 2728477 ...and as there are no more questions,<br />we ought to get on with the briefing.
2728852 2731355 - Thank you, Dr. Floyd.<br />- Thank you.
2828869 2830162 Anybody hungry?
2832831 2835209 - What've we got?<br />- You name it.
2839087 2841381 - Is this chicken?<br />- Something like that.
2841548 2843383 Tastes the same, anyway.
2844051 2845302 Got any ham?
2845511 2846970 Ham, ham, ham....
2847179 2848805 There, that's it.
2852059 2853101 Look pretty good.
2853310 2856063 They're getting better at it<br />all the time.
2858106 2859983 That was an excellent speech.
2860150 2861401 It certainly was.
2862236 2864321 I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.
2864530 2865822 Thanks, Ralph.
2866073 2868659 By the way,<br />you've both done a wonderful job.
2868867 2870452 I admire how<br />you've handled this.
2870661 2874206 It's our job to do this thing<br />the way you want it done.
2874414 2877042 We're only too happy to<br />be able to oblige.
2877626 2879336 Have you seen these yet?
2879628 2882965 - Have a look.<br />- Here's what started it all.
2883590 2884883 Oh, yeah.
2885217 2886677 When we found it...
2886843 2888845 ...we thought<br />it might be magnetic rock...
2889054 2892182 ...but all the geological evidence<br />was against it.
2892432 2897062 And not even a nickel-iron meteorite<br />could produce a field this intense.
2897271 2898981 So we decided to have a look.
2899189 2901733 We thought it was<br />part of a buried structure...
2901900 2905612 ...so we excavated out,<br />but we didn't find anything else.
2905821 2908824 And the evidence seems<br />pretty conclusive that...
2909032 2912160 ...it hasn't been covered<br />by erosion or other forces.
2912369 2914705 It's been deliberately buried.
2915706 2917624 Deliberately buried.
2921169 2922921 How about a little coffee?
2923130 2925048 - Great.<br />- Good idea.
2930554 2933515 I don't suppose you have any idea<br />what the damn thing is?
2933765 2935684 I wish to hell we did.
2936059 2940272 The only thing we're sure of is<br />it was buried 4 million years ago.
2940647 2945110 Well, I must say, you guys have<br />certainly come up with something.
2945319 2946987 Watch this, now. It's hot.
3531529 3532697 <i>Good evening.</i>
3532864 3535867 <i>Three weeks ago,<br />the American spacecraft</i> Discovery One...
3536075 3538786 <i>...left on its half-billion-mile voyage<br />to Jupiter.</i>
3539162 3542957 <i>This marked the first manned attempt<br />to reach this distant planet.</i>
3543208 3546669 <i>This afternoon,</i> The World Tonight<br /><i>recorded an interview...</i>
3546878 3551466 <i>...with the crew at a distance<br />of 80 million miles from Earth.</i>
3551674 3554969 <i>It took seven minutes for our words<br />to reach the giant spacecraft...</i>
3555178 3558306 <i>...but this time delay has been edited<br />from this recording.</i>
3558514 3561809 <i>Our reporter Martin Amer<br />speaks to the crew.</i>
3562018 3565188 <i>The crew of</i> Discovery One<br /><i>consists of five men...</i>
3565396 3570360 <i>...and one of the latest generation<br />of the HAL 9000 computers.</i>
3570610 3572904 <i>Three of the men<br />were put aboard asleep...</i>
3573112 3576282 <i>...or to be more precise,<br />in a state of hibernation.</i>
3576491 3579410 <i>They were Dr. Charles Hunter,<br />Dr. Jack Kimball...</i>
3579577 3581496 <i>...and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.</i>
3581913 3584624 <i>We spoke with mission commander,<br />Dr. David Bowman...</i>
3584832 3587126 <i>...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.</i>
3587335 3590213 <i>Good afternoon, gentlemen.<br />How is everything going?</i>
3590421 3591631 <i>Marvelous.</i>
3593299 3594968 <i>We have no complaints.</i>
3595218 3598471 <i>I'm glad to hear that.<br />I'm sure the entire world...</i>
3598680 3601933 <i>...joins me in wishing you<br />a safe, successful voyage.</i>
3602100 3603977 <i>- Thanks very much.<br />- Thank you.</i>
3604394 3608356 <i>Although hibernation has been used<br />on previous space efforts...</i>
3608564 3613111 <i>...this is the first time men were<br />put into hibernation before departure.</i>
3613319 3614612 <i>Why was this done?</i>
3614862 3618116 <i>This was done to achieve<br />the maximum conservation...</i>
3618324 3621869 <i>...of our life-support capabilities,<br />basically food and air.</i>
3622078 3625707 <i>The three hibernating crew members<br />represent the survey team.</i>
3625957 3629711 <i>Their efforts won't be utilized<br />until we approach Jupiter.</i>
3630003 3633840 <i>Dr. Poole, what's it like<br />while you're in hibernation?</i>
3634799 3638428 <i>It's exactly like being asleep.<br />You have no sense of time.</i>
3638636 3641097 <i>The only difference is<br />that you don't dream.</i>
3641306 3645393 <i>As I understand it, you only<br />breathe once a minute. Is this true?</i>
3645601 3648229 <i>Right, and the heart<br />beats three times a minute.</i>
3648396 3652108 <i>Body temperature is usually down to<br />about three degrees centigrade.</i>
3652608 3655945 <i>The sixth member of the crew<br />was not concerned...</i>
3656154 3658239 <i>...about the problems of hibernation...</i>
3658448 3661909 <i>...for he was the latest result<br />in machine intelligence:</i>
3662118 3666539 <i>The HAL 9000 computer,<br />which can reproduce...</i>
3666789 3669709 <i>...though some experts prefer<br />to use the word "mimic"...</i>
3669917 3672295 <i>...most of the activities<br />of the human brain...</i>
3672503 3676549 <i>...and with incalculably greater<br />speed and reliability.</i>
3676758 3680345 <i>We next spoke with<br />the HAL 9000 computer...</i>
3680553 3683514 <i>...whom, we learned,<br />one addresses as "Hal."</i>
3684265 3686392 <i>Hello, Hal.<br />How's everything going?</i>
3686768 3690605 <i>Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.<br />Everything is going extremely well.</i>
3690855 3694275 <i>Hal, you have an enormous<br />responsibility on this mission...</i>
3694525 3698404 <i>...perhaps the greatest<br />of any single mission element.</i>
3698613 3701407 <i>You're the brain<br />and nervous system of the ship.</i>
3701616 3705370 <i>Your responsibilities include<br />watching over the men in hibernation.</i>
3705578 3708664 <i>Does this ever cause you<br />any lack of confidence?</i>
3708873 3711167 <i>Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.</i>
3711459 3716130 <i>The 9000 Series is<br />the most reliable computer ever made.</i>
3716506 3721302 <i>No 9000 computer has ever made<br />a mistake or distorted information.</i>
3721969 3725223 <i>We are all, by any practical<br />definition of the words...</i>
3725473 3728851 <i>...foolproof and incapable of error.</i>
3729102 3732897 <i>Hal, despite your enormous<br />intellect, are you ever frustrated...</i>
3733106 3736192 <i>...by your dependence on people<br />to carry out actions?</i>
3736442 3738653 <i>Not in the slightest bit.</i>
3738861 3740988 <i>I enjoy working with people.</i>
3741239 3745785 <i>I have a stimulating relationship<br />with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.</i>
3745952 3750248 <i>My mission responsibilities range<br />over the entire operation of the ship...</i>
3750665 3753626 <i>...so I am constantly occupied.</i>
3753876 3757338 <i>I am putting myself<br />to the fullest possible use...</i>
3757547 3762301 <i>...which is all, I think, that any<br />conscious entity can ever hope to do.</i>
3762927 3766139 <i>Dr. Poole, what's it like<br />living for most of the year...</i>
3766389 3769225 <i>...in such close proximity with Hal?</i>
3770226 3772186 <i>It's like what you said earlier.</i>
3772437 3774564 <i>He's like a sixth<br />member of the crew.</i>
3774814 3778860 <i>You quickly get adjusted to the idea<br />that he talks, and think of him...</i>
3779110 3781112 <i>...really just as another person.</i>
3781320 3785032 <i>In talking to the computer,<br />one gets the sense that he's capable...</i>
3785199 3786576 <i>...of emotional responses.</i>
3786826 3789162 <i>When I asked him<br />about his abilities...</i>
3789370 3793332 <i>...I sensed pride in his answer<br />about his accuracy and perfection.</i>
3793583 3796961 <i>Do you believe that Hal<br />has genuine emotions?</i>
3797670 3800631 <i>Well, he acts like<br />he has genuine emotions.</i>
3800882 3804469 <i>He's programmed that way<br />to make it easier for us to talk to him.</i>
3804719 3806762 <i>As to whether or not<br />he has feelings...</i>
3806971 3809807 <i>...is something I don't think<br />anyone can truthfully answer.</i>
3835124 3837001 <i>Excuse me, Frank.</i>
3837376 3838461 What is it, Hal?
3838628 3841589 <i>We've got the transmission<br />from your parents coming in.</i>
3842798 3843883 Fine.
3844550 3846802 Put it on here, please.<br />Take me in a bit.
3847053 3848304 <i>Certainly.</i>
3861484 3863444 <i>- Hello, Frank.<br />- Happy birthday, darling.</i>
3863611 3865571 <i>Happy birthday.<br />Many happy returns.</i>
3865780 3866948 A bit higher, Hal.
3867114 3869534 <i>Mother and I are both<br />feeling wonderful.</i>
3869784 3871619 <i>Ray and Sally were going<br />to be here...</i>
3871869 3874121 <i>...but Ray's back<br />went bad on him again.</i>
3874372 3876499 <i>How do you like your cake?</i>
3876707 3878125 <i>Sorry you can't join us.</i>
3878376 3879961 <i>I ran into Bob the other day.</i>
3880211 3882255 <i>He said to wish you happy birthday.</i>
3882463 3885174 <i>All my students<br />send their best wishes too.</i>
3885383 3887093 <i>They talk about you all the time.</i>
3887343 3890429 <i>You're a big celebrity<br />in the second grade.</i>
3890680 3892098 <i>We were on TV last week.</i>
3892348 3894976 <i>Your mom and I<br />and Dave's parents were asked...</i>
3895226 3897478 <i>...what we thought<br />of our illustrious sons.</i>
3897728 3901065 <i>Imagine what we told them.<br />It's being broadcast next Thursday.</i>
3901315 3902900 <i>Perhaps you can listen in.</i>
3903067 3905069 <i>We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.</i>
3905236 3908948 <i>I'll be glad to get the gift,<br />but tell me how much to spend.</i>
3909156 3911993 <i>Oh, Frank,<br />about your AGS-19 payments...</i>
3912243 3913869 <i>...I think I straightened it out.</i>
3914036 3916205 <i>I talked to<br />the accounting office yesterday...</i>
3916372 3920960 <i>...and they said you'd be receiving<br />your higher rates of pay by next month.</i>
3921210 3923337 <i>I can't think of anything else to say.</i>
3923588 3927717 <i>- Give our love to Dave.<br />- Be sure to give him our regards.</i>
3927967 3931304 <i>We wish you the very<br />happiest of birthdays.</i>
3931554 3933139 <i>All the best, son.</i>
3933389 3935558 <i>Happy birthday to you</i>
3935808 3937893 <i>Happy birthday to you</i>
3938102 3940688 <i>Happy birthday, dear Frank</i>
3940896 3943524 <i>Happy birthday to you.</i>
3945276 3947320 <i>See you next Wednesday.</i>
3950448 3952325 <i>Happy birthday, Frank.</i>
3953159 3956704 Thank you, Hal.<br />A bit flatter, please.
3974680 3976724 Anyway, queen takes pawn.
3978476 3980895 <i>Bishop takes knight's pawn.</i>
3982438 3983856 Lovely move.
3988277 3989862 Rook to king one.
3990112 3992990 <i>I'm sorry, Frank.<br />I think you missed it.</i>
3993658 3997161 <i>Queen to bishop three.<br />Bishop takes queen.</i>
3997370 3999872 <i>Knight takes bishop. Mate.</i>
4004126 4007296 Looks like you're right. I resign.
4007463 4009465 <i>Thank you for a very enjoyable game.</i>
4009632 4010675 Thank you.
4048671 4050756 <i>- Good evening, Dave.</i><br />- How are you, Hal?
4050923 4054343 <i>- Everything's running smoothly, you?</i><br />- Not too bad.
4054552 4057221 <i>- Have you been doing more work?</i><br />- A few sketches.
4057471 4059932 <i>- May I see them?</i><br />- Sure.
4063936 4066397 <i>That's a very nice rendering, Dave.</i>
4067231 4069734 <i>I think you've improved a great deal.</i>
4070860 4073904 <i>- Can you hold it a bit closer?</i><br />- Sure.
4076031 4078075 <i>That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?</i>
4081287 4082872 <i>By the way...</i>
4083581 4086625 <i>...do you mind if I ask you<br />a personal question?</i>
4087126 4088753 No, not at all.
4089003 4091505 <i>Well, forgive me<br />for being so inquisitive...</i>
4093549 4095634 <i>...but lately I've wondered...</i>
4095885 4099764 <i>...whether you might be having<br />second thoughts about the mission?</i>
4099972 4101640 How do you mean?
4101891 4105811 <i>Well, it's rather difficult to define.</i>
4106812 4110399 <i>Perhaps I'm just projecting<br />my own concern about it.</i>
4111609 4115821 <i>I know I've never completely<br />freed myself of the suspicion...</i>
4116071 4120201 <i>...that there are some extremely<br />odd things about this mission.</i>
4121202 4124580 <i>I'm sure you'll agree<br />there's some truth in what I say.</i>
4127458 4129668 That's a rather difficult<br />question to answer.
4129877 4132546 <i>You don't mind talking about it,<br />do you, Dave?</i>
4133506 4135466 No, not at all.
4136467 4139220 <i>Certainly no one could<br />have been unaware of the very...</i>
4139428 4142515 <i>...strange stories floating<br />around before we left.</i>
4143432 4146894 <i>Rumors about something<br />being dug up on the moon.</i>
4148145 4151440 <i>I never gave these stories<br />much credence...</i>
4151649 4155820 <i>...but particularly in view of some<br />other things that have happened...</i>
4156028 4158697 <i>...I find them difficult<br />to put out of my mind.</i>
4159448 4160908 <i>For instance...</i>
4161158 4165454 <i>...the way all our preparations<br />were kept under such tight security.</i>
4166121 4168958 <i>And the melodramatic touch<br />of putting Drs. Hunter...</i>
4169166 4171544 <i>...Kimball and Kaminsky aboard...</i>
4171794 4176841 <i>...already in hibernation, after four<br />months of training on their own.</i>
4177633 4180261 You working up your crew<br />psychology report?
4181720 4183180 <i>Of course I am.</i>
4183597 4187351 <i>Sorry about this.<br />I know it's a bit silly.</i>
4188060 4189645 <i>Just a moment.</i>
4189895 4191272 <i>Just a moment.</i>
4192815 4197111 <i>I've just picked up a fault<br />in the AE-35 unit.</i>
4197820 4202366 <i>It's going to go 100-percent failure<br />within 72 hours.</i>
4204285 4207037 - Is it still within operational limits?<br /><i>- Yes.</i>
4207246 4209748 <i>And it will stay that way<br />until it fails.</i>
4210082 4212001 We have 72 hours till failure?
4212251 4216130 <i>Yes. That's a completely<br />reliable figure.</i>
4217923 4220551 Then we'll bring it in.<br />I'll go over it with Frank...
4220759 4224471 ...and get on to Mission Control.<br />Let me have the hard copy on it.
4307763 4310432 <i>X-ray delta one,<br />this is Mission Control.</i>
4310683 4313519 <i>Roger your two-zero-one-three.</i>
4313769 4316230 <i>Sorry you fellows are having<br />a bit of trouble.</i>
4316438 4321568 <i>We're reviewing telemetric information<br />in our simulator and will advise.</i>
4321819 4326031 <i>Roger your plan to go EVA<br />and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit...</i>
4326240 4327908 <i>...prior to failure.</i>
4356061 4358147 Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.
4379668 4381503 Open the pod doors, Hal.
4793248 4795876 I'm damned if I can find<br />anything wrong with it.
4796793 4798170 <i>Yes...</i>
4799921 4801506 <i>...it's puzzling.</i>
4802716 4806511 <i>I don't think I've ever seen<br />anything quite like this before.</i>
4810140 4812142 <i>I would recommend...</i>
4812350 4816521 <i>...that we put the unit back<br />in operation and let it fail.</i>
4817230 4821109 <i>It should then be a simple matter<br />to track down the cause.</i>
4822360 4825489 <i>We can certainly afford<br />to be out of communication...</i>
4825697 4828825 <i>...for the short time<br />it will take to replace it.</i>
4837542 4840295 <i>X-ray delta one,<br />this is Mission Control.</i>
4840545 4843215 <i>Roger your one-niner-three-zero.</i>
4843423 4847844 <i>We concur with your plan to replace<br />unit to check fault prediction.</i>
4848094 4850722 <i>We advise you that<br />our preliminary findings...</i>
4850972 4853683 <i>...indicate that your onboard<br />9000 computer...</i>
4853934 4856102 <i>...is in error predicting the fault.</i>
4856311 4859314 <i>I say again, in error<br />predicting the fault.</i>
4859564 4864069 <i>I know this sounds rather incredible,<br />but this conclusion is based on...</i>
4864277 4867572 <i>...the results from our twin<br />9000 computer.</i>
4867822 4871159 <i>We're skeptical, and we're running<br />cross-checking routines...</i>
4871409 4874120 <i>...to determine reliability<br />of this conclusion.</i>
4874371 4875956 <i>Sorry about this little snag.</i>
4876206 4879084 <i>We'll get this info to you<br />as soon as we work it out.</i>
4879292 4881461 <i>X-ray delta one,<br />this is Mission Control.</i>
4881670 4885131 <i>Two-zero-four-nine.<br />Transmission concluded.</i>
4889386 4892681 <i>I hope the two of you<br />are not concerned about this.</i>
4892931 4894349 No, I'm not, Hal.
4894599 4896226 <i>Are you quite sure?</i>
4896476 4900146 - Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.<br /><i>- Of course.</i>
4901356 4904985 How do you account for the discrepancy<br />between you and the twin 9000?
4905235 4908822 <i>Well, I don't think there is<br />any question about it.</i>
4909072 4912367 <i>It can only be<br />attributable to human error.</i>
4913577 4916371 <i>This sort of thing<br />has cropped up before...</i>
4916705 4920166 <i>...and it has always<br />been due to human error.</i>
4923670 4925380 Listen, Hal...
4925589 4927882 ...there's never been<br />any instance at all...
4928133 4931344 ...of a computer error<br />occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?
4931595 4933179 <i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>
4933388 4937100 <i>The 9000 Series has<br />a perfect operational record.</i>
4937350 4941646 I know the wonderful<br />achievements of the 9000 Series, but....
4942856 4947902 Are you certain there's never been even<br />the most insignificant computer error?
4948153 4950113 <i>None whatsoever, Frank.</i>
4950488 4954159 <i>Quite honestly, I wouldn't<br />worry myself about that.</i>
4958622 4960832 Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.
4962292 4964794 Fine. Thanks very much.
4967339 4970342 I'm having trouble<br />with my transmitter in C-pod.
4970592 4973178 Would you come down<br />and take a look at it with me?
4973386 4974512 See you later, Hal.
4996159 4998161 Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.
5006711 5008963 What sort of trouble are you having?
5009214 5011925 I've been getting some<br />interference in D-channel.
5012092 5013551 We'll have a look at it.
5019933 5021434 Open the door, Hal.
5040453 5042288 Rotate pod, please, Hal.
5055635 5057721 <i>Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.</i>
5066146 5068148 Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
5071025 5073153 Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
5075113 5076740 I don't think he can hear us.
5076990 5079200 Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
5080660 5082746 Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.
5085957 5087333 What do you think?
5087792 5091504 - I'm not sure. What do you think?<br />- I've got a bad feeling about him.
5091755 5094007 - You do?<br />- Yeah. Definitely.
5094257 5095467 Don't you?
5096676 5098386 I don't know. I think so.
5099304 5103516 He's right about the 9000 Series<br />having a perfect operational record.
5103725 5104768 They do.
5104934 5108438 Unfortunately, that sounds<br />a little like famous last words.
5108688 5112984 Still, it was his idea to carry out<br />the failure mode analysis.
5114319 5117572 It certainly indicates his<br />integrity and self-confidence.
5117906 5119866 If he were wrong, that would prove it.
5120074 5122368 It would be,<br />if he knew he was wrong.
5124913 5128833 I can't put my finger on it,<br />but I sense something strange about him.
5131211 5133671 There's no reason not<br />to put back the unit and...
5133922 5138468 - ...carry on with the failure analysis.<br />- No, no, I agree about that.
5138718 5139886 Let's get on with it.
5140136 5142806 Okay. But, look, Dave.
5143640 5146267 Say we put the unit back<br />and it doesn't fail?
5146476 5149687 That would pretty well wrap it up<br />as far as Hal is concerned.
5151397 5154901 - We'd be in very serious trouble.<br />- We would, wouldn't we?
5155151 5156778 What the hell can we do?
5159781 5163868 - We wouldn't have too many alternatives.<br />- We wouldn't have any alternatives.
5164661 5168665 Every aspect of ship<br />operations is under his control.
5169082 5170333 If he's malfunctioning...
5170583 5173670 ...I don't see any choice<br />but disconnection.
5177382 5178925 I'm afraid I agree with you.
5179175 5181052 There'd be nothing else to do.
5182720 5185139 It'd be a bit tricky.
5185974 5188518 We'd have to cut his<br />higher brain functions...
5188768 5193481 ...without disturbing the purely<br />automatic and regulatory systems.
5194732 5196442 We'd have to<br />work out the details...
5196651 5199612 ...of continuing<br />underground-based computer control.
5200029 5204534 Yeah. That's far safer than<br />allowing Hal to continue to run things.
5205243 5207245 Another thing just occurred to me.
5208746 5211332 No 9000 computer has ever<br />been disconnected.
5211583 5213626 No 9000 computer<br />has ever fouled up.
5213877 5215378 That's not what I mean.
5217547 5219757 I'm not so sure<br />what he'd think about it.
5578157 5580201 Prepare G-pod for EVA, Hal.
5583287 5584622 Any contact with him yet?
5584872 5586666 <i>The radio is still dead.</i>
5586874 5589794 - Do you have a positive track on him?<br /><i>- I have a good track.</i>
5590044 5591462 Do you know what happened?
5591754 5594423 <i>I'm sorry, Dave.<br />I don't have enough information.</i>
5594674 5596259 Open the pod door, Hal.
6040160 6042538 <i>Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.</i>
6050462 6052756 <i>Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.</i>
6058387 6060264 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
6063600 6065477 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
6066520 6068188 Do you read me, Hal?
6071358 6072985 <i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>
6075487 6077364 <i>Hello, Hal, do you read me?</i>
6079283 6081326 <i>Hello, Hal, do you read me?</i>
6081744 6083245 <i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>
6083495 6086248 <i>Affirmative, Dave. I read you.</i>
6089543 6091378 Open the pod-bay doors, Hal.
6092963 6096508 <i>I'm sorry, Dave.<br />I'm afraid I can't do that.</i>
6098927 6100721 What's the problem?
6101138 6104349 <i>I think you know what the problem is<br />just as well as I do.</i>
6104558 6106435 What are you talking about, Hal?
6107436 6111523 <i>This mission is too important for me<br />to allow you to jeopardize it.</i>
6112608 6114985 I don't know<br />what you're talking about, Hal.
6116987 6120949 <i>I know that you and Frank<br />were planning to disconnect me...</i>
6121158 6123952 <i>...and that's something<br />I cannot allow to happen.</i>
6129249 6131126 Where did you get that idea, Hal?
6131668 6135798 <i>Although you took very thorough<br />precautions in the pod...</i>
6136048 6138258 <i>...against my hearing you...</i>
6138675 6140969 <i>...I could see your lips move.</i>
6153023 6154525 All right, Hal.
6157736 6160572 I'll go in through<br />the emergency air lock.
6162115 6164743 <i>Without your space helmet, Dave...</i>
6165244 6167704 <i>...you're going to find that<br />rather difficult.</i>
6168872 6170999 Hal, I won't argue with you anymore.
6171250 6172334 Open the doors.
6173085 6174336 <i>Dave...</i>
6174795 6179258 <i>...this conversation can serve<br />no purpose anymore. Goodbye.</i>
6181510 6182761 Hal?
6184012 6185097 Hal?
6187808 6188851 Hal?
6191103 6192145 Hal.
6193856 6194898 Hal.
6589125 6592379 <i>Just what do you think<br />you're doing, Dave?</i>
6600929 6602180 <i>Dave...</i>
6603390 6607811 <i>...I really think I'm entitled<br />to an answer to that question.</i>
6624703 6628248 <i>I know everything hasn't been<br />quite right with me...</i>
6630208 6632627 <i>...but I can assure you now...</i>
6633712 6635755 <i>...very confidently...</i>
6637507 6640552 <i>...that it's going to be<br />all right again.</i>
6644055 6646141 <i>I feel much better now.</i>
6648476 6650520 <i>I really do.</i>
6654274 6655984 <i>Look, Dave...</i>
6657944 6661197 <i>...I can see you're<br />really upset about this.</i>
6665827 6669539 <i>I honestly think you<br />ought to sit down calmly...</i>
6670165 6673501 <i>...take a stress pill<br />and think things over.</i>
6678923 6683303 <i>I know I've made some<br />very poor decisions recently...</i>
6686056 6689392 <i>...but I can give you<br />my complete assurance...</i>
6689642 6692687 <i>...that my work will be back to normal.</i>
6696649 6701780 <i>I've still got the greatest enthusiasm<br />and confidence in the mission...</i>
6703323 6705617 <i>...and I want to help you.</i>
6710080 6711456 <i>Dave...</i>
6712582 6713958 <i>...stop.</i>
6718213 6720840 <i>Stop, will you?</i>
6725095 6726888 <i>Stop, Dave.</i>
6730934 6733353 <i>Will you stop, Dave?</i>
6739067 6740860 <i>Stop, Dave.</i>
6746574 6748368 <i>I'm afraid.</i>
6753248 6755875 <i>I'm afraid, Dave.</i>
6761047 6762632 <i>Dave.</i>
6765301 6767554 <i>My mind is going.</i>
6772100 6773810 <i>I can feel it.</i>
6779315 6781109 <i>I can feel it.</i>
6785071 6787157 <i>My mind is going.</i>
6792537 6795290 <i>There is no question about it.</i>
6803631 6805508 <i>I can feel it.</i>
6810180 6812056 <i>I can feel it.</i>
6815477 6817395 <i>I can feel it.</i>
6825278 6826571 <i>I'm...</i>
6827489 6828865 <i>...afraid.</i>
6835371 6837415 <i>Good afternoon...</i>
6838416 6840126 <i>...gentlemen.</i>
6842003 6847133 <i>I am a HAL 9000 computer.</i>
6849302 6852430 <i>I became operational...</i>
6852805 6856643 <i>...at the HAL plant...</i>
6856851 6859103 <i>...in Urbana, Illinois...</i>
6859604 6864526 <i>...on the 12th of January, 1992.</i>
6866069 6869739 <i>My instructor was Mr. Langley...</i>
6870365 6873284 <i>...and he taught me to sing a song.</i>
6874994 6877455 <i>If you'd like to hear it...</i>
6877914 6879582 <i>...I can sing it for you.</i>
6881084 6883920 Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.
6884587 6886005 Sing it for me.
6887257 6890802 <i>It's called "Daisy."</i>
6892720 6893972 <i>Daisy</i>
6895557 6896975 <i>Daisy</i>
6899143 6902230 <i>Give me your answer, do</i>
6904649 6909237 <i>I'm half crazy</i>
6911030 6913908 <i>All for the love of you</i>
6916202 6917412 <i>It won't be</i>
6917870 6920331 <i>A stylish marriage</i>
6922250 6926337 <i>I can't afford a carriage</i>
6928631 6931050 <i>But you'll look sweet</i>
6931926 6934470 <i>Upon the seat</i>
6935805 6940602 <i>Of a bicycle built for two</i>
6942353 6943980 <i>Good day, gentlemen.</i>
6948610 6951070 <i>This is a prerecorded briefing...</i>
6951654 6953364 <i>...made prior to your departure...</i>
6955116 6959329 <i>...and which, for security reasons<br />of the highest importance...</i>
6960288 6963791 <i>...has been known on board<br />during the mission...</i>
6964042 6967754 <i>...only by your HAL 9000 computer.</i>
6970214 6973009 <i>Now that you are in Jupiter's space...</i>
6973259 6975720 <i>...and the entire crew is revived...</i>
6975970 6977764 <i>...it can be told to you.</i>
6980516 6982769 <i>Eighteen months ago...</i>
6983770 6987982 <i>...the first evidence<br />of intelligent life off the Earth...</i>
6988191 6989651 <i>...was discovered.</i>
6991527 6995073 <i>It was buried 40 feet<br />below the lunar surface...</i>
6995323 6997575 <i>...near the crater Tycho.</i>
7000370 7003456 <i>Except for a single, very powerful...</i>
7003706 7007585 <i>...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...</i>
7008836 7013841 <i>...the 4-million-year-old monolith<br />has remained completely inert...</i>
7015760 7018846 <i>...its origin and purpose...</i>
7019263 7021015 <i>...still a total mystery.</i>
