1541957 1544501 Here you are, sir.<br />Main level, please.
1545544 1547087 Right. See you on the way back.
1547254 1549048 - Bye.<br />- Bye.
1549757 1551717 - Good morning, sir.<br />- Morning.
1551884 1554970 - We haven't seen you for a long time.<br />- Nice to see you again.
1555179 1557598 - Did you have a pleasant flight?<br />- Very nice.
1557806 1560934 Mr. Miller of Station Security<br />is supposed to meet me.
1561143 1563645 - May I call him for you?<br />- Would you? Here he is.
1563854 1565254 - Hello, Dr. Floyd.<br />- Hello, Miller.
1565397 1567357 - Sorry I'm late.<br />- That's all right.
1567566 1569526 It's nice to have you back.
1569735 1571987 - Did you have a good flight?<br />- Very nice.
1572196 1574990 - Shall we go through?<br />- Would you please use number 17?
1575199 1577951 - Thank you, Miss Turner. This way.<br />- Thank you.
1583499 1586001 Welcome to Voice Print Identification.
1586251 1590339 When you see the red light go on,<br />please state in the following order:
1590589 1594676 Your destination,<br />your nationality, and your full name.
1594927 1597721 Surname first, Christian name,<br />and initial.
1599389 1603727 Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.
1606230 1609775 Thank you. You are cleared through<br />Voice Print Identification.
1610567 1611819 Thank you.
1618742 1621912 - Have I got time for breakfast?<br />- I think we can manage that.
1622121 1623205 How long have I got?
1623372 1625916 Your flight leaves<br />in an hour and 10 minutes.
1626083 1629545 I've reserved a table for you<br />in the Earthlight Room.
1629753 1633006 It's been seven or eight months<br />since you were here, hasn't it?
1633215 1635300 Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.
1635509 1638095 I suppose you saw the work<br />on the new section?
1638262 1640806 - Coming along great, huh?<br />- Yeah, it's fine.
1640973 1642015 Oh, wait.
1642182 1645853 I've got to make a couple calls.<br />I'll meet you in the restaurant.
1674673 1676717 - Dad?<br />- Hello.
1677968 1681388 Hi, squirt. What are you doing?
1682931 1683974 Playing.
1684141 1685601 Where's mommy?
1685851 1687311 Gone to shopping.
1687561 1690022 - Who's taking care of you?<br />- Rachel.
1690230 1693650 - May I speak to Rachel, please?<br />- She's gone to the bathroom.
1693901 1696612 Are you coming<br />to my party tomorrow?
1696862 1699281 I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.
1699698 1700866 Why not?
1701033 1703619 Well, you know, daddy's traveling.
1704161 1706496 Very sorry about it, but I just can't.
1707623 1710667 I'm going to send you<br />a very nice present, though.
1712169 1713212 All right.
1713378 1715547 - Anything special that you want?<br />- Yes.
1715756 1716840 What?
1717174 1718634 A telephone.
1719176 1721345 We've got lots of telephones already.
1721553 1725891 Can't you think of anything else<br />for your birthday? Something special?
1726141 1727559 - Yes.<br />- What?
1727976 1729019 A bush baby.
1729186 1731730 A bush baby?<br />We'll have to see about that.
1731939 1735692 I want you to tell mommy<br />something for me. Will you remember?
1735901 1738862 Tell mommy that I telephoned, okay?
1740447 1743325 And that I'll try<br />to telephone again tomorrow.
1743575 1745494 Now, will you tell her that?
1747454 1750332 Okay, sweetheart.<br />Have a nice birthday tomorrow.
1750582 1751625 All right.
1751792 1754878 And have a nice birthday party<br />tomorrow too, huh?
1755671 1756713 All right.
1756880 1759508 Take care and be a good girl,<br />won't you?
1759758 1760968 All right. Bye-bye.
1761218 1763637 Bye-bye. Happy birthday.
1777401 1781738 - Elena, nice to see you again.<br />- Heywood, what a surprise.
1781905 1784908 - You're looking wonderful.<br />- You're looking well too.
1785075 1787119 This is my friend,<br />Dr. Heywood Floyd.
1787286 1789788 - I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.<br />- How do you do?
1789955 1791832 - Dr. Stretyeneva.<br />- How do you do?
1791999 1793792 And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.
1793959 1796378 How do you do?<br />I've heard a lot about you.
1796628 1798130 Do sit down.
1798505 1800507 - Well, we...<br />- No, no, please.
1800924 1802384 Thank you.
1802551 1805595 - Would you like a drink?<br />- No, thank you.
1805762 1809099 I haven't had breakfast yet.<br />Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.
1809308 1811768 I'll just sit with you a moment.<br />Then I'll be off.
1811977 1814563 - Are you quite sure?<br />- Quite sure, thank you.
1815772 1817983 - Well, how's Gregor?<br />- He's fine.
1818233 1821528 He's been doing underwater research<br />in the Baltic...
1821778 1825824 so I'm afraid we don't see<br />very much of each other these days.
1826074 1829661 - When you see him, give him my regards.<br />- Yes, of course.
1829911 1832873 Well, where are you all off to?<br />Up or down?
1833081 1834124 We're going home.
1834333 1839212 We've spent three months calibrating<br />the new antenna at Tchalinko.
1839463 1842132 - What about you?<br />- I'm on my way to Clavius.
1842382 1843675 Oh, are you?
1846345 1849639 Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think<br />I'm being too inquisitive...
1849848 1854978 but perhaps you can clear up the big<br />mystery about what is going on there.
1855771 1857898 I'm afraid I don't know<br />what you mean.
1858148 1859858 For the past two weeks...
1860067 1863487 some extremely odd things<br />have been happening at Clavius.
1863737 1865822 - Oh, really?<br />- Yes, yes.
1866114 1870410 For one thing, when you phone the base,<br />all you get is a recording...
1870619 1874790 which repeats that the phone lines<br />are temporarily out of order.
1876333 1878794 Probably having some trouble<br />with their equipment.
1880295 1885217 That's what we thought at first,<br />but it's been going on now for 10 days.
1885467 1888220 You haven't been able to<br />contact anyone for 10 days?
1888428 1889805 That's right.
1890097 1891139 Oh, I see.
1891306 1894976 There's another thing.<br />Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...
1895185 1898105 was denied permission<br />for an emergency landing.
1898313 1899356 That does sound odd.
1899523 1902734 I'm afraid there's going to be<br />a bit of a row about it.
1902984 1906863 Denying the men permission to land<br />violates the IAS convention.
1907072 1909908 Yes, of course.<br />Did the crew get back all right?
1910117 1913578 - Fortunately, they did.<br />- Well, I'm glad about that.
1917165 1921128 At the risk of pressing you on<br />a point you seem reticent to discuss...
1921378 1923964 May I ask you<br />a straightfonnard question?
1924172 1925632 Well, certainly.
1928385 1932722 Frankly, we have had some<br />very reliable intelligence reports that...
1932973 1936351 quite a serious epidemic<br />has broken out at Clavius.
1936601 1940605 Something, apparently,<br />of an unknown origin.
1940856 1943233 Is this, in fact, what has happened?
1948488 1950574 I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...
1951950 1954661 I'm really not at liberty<br />to discuss this.
1956288 1957456 I understand.
1958915 1962127 But this epidemic<br />could easily spread to our base.
1962335 1964421 We should be given all the facts.
1964629 1966465 Yes, I know.
1969468 1972512 As I said,<br />I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
1975307 1978101 Won't you change your mind<br />about that drink?
1978310 1980645 No, I'm positive.<br />I really must be going.
1980896 1983940 I hope you and your wife come<br />to the IAC conference.
1984149 1985484 I hope we can make it.
1985692 1988737 If you do, bring that darling<br />little daughter with you.
1988945 1992866 That'll depend on school vacations<br />and all that sort of thing.
1993116 1994159 If we can, we will.
1994367 1997287 You've got an invitation<br />if you ever get to the states.
1997496 2000248 Gregor and I will look foward<br />to seeing you.
2001208 2002250 Goodbye, Elena.
2002667 2005545 It's been a pleasure meeting you all.<br />Dr. Smyslov.
2005754 2009716 Whatever the reasons for your visit,<br />the very best of luck to you.
2009925 2010967 Thank you.
2011218 2012427 Ladies.
2487652 2489487 Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.
2489654 2491948 I'm through now.<br />Thank you very much, gentlemen.
2492115 2493491 You're welcome.
2506129 2507296 Well...
2507797 2510591 I know you will all<br />want to join with me...
2510842 2514721 In welcoming our distinguished<br />friend and colleague...
2514929 2519142 From the National Council<br />of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.
2519392 2524522 Dr. Floyd has come up specially<br />to Clavius to be with us today.
2525815 2529152 Before the briefing, he'd like<br />to have a few words with you.
2529360 2530445 Dr. Floyd?
2543374 2545334 Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.
2545585 2548421 Hi, everybody.<br />Nice to be back with you.
2551716 2555303 First, I bring a personal message<br />from Dr. Howell...
2555553 2558347 Who has asked me to convey<br />his deep appreciation...
2558598 2561684 For the many sacrifices<br />you've had to make.
2561934 2565772 And, of course, his congratulations<br />on your discovery...
2566314 2570943 Which may prove to be among the most<br />significant in the history of science.
2575156 2579077 I know there have been some<br />conflicting views...
2579327 2582955 Regarding the need for<br />complete security in this matter.
2583164 2586876 More specifically, your opposition<br />to the cover story...
2587293 2590838 Created to give the impression<br />of an epidemic at the base.
2591881 2595843 I understand that beyond it being<br />a matter of principle...
2596469 2599931 Many of you are troubled<br />by the concern and anxiety...
2600181 2605269 This story of an epidemic might cause<br />to your relatives and friends on earth.
2606437 2609232 I completely sympathize<br />with your negative views.
2610525 2614195 I find this cover story<br />personally embarrassing, myself.
2614987 2619283 However, I accept the need<br />for absolute secrecy in this.
2619992 2621869 And I hope you will too.
2624497 2627333 I'm sure you're all aware<br />of the grave potential...
2627542 2630211 For cultural shock<br />and social disorientation...
2630419 2632797 Contained in this situation...
2633005 2635508 If the facts were<br />prematurely made public...
2635716 2638803 Without adequate preparation<br />and conditioning.
2639554 2640888 Anyway...
2641097 2643307 This is the view of the council.
2644183 2648354 The purpose of my visit is to gather<br />additional facts and opinions...
2648563 2650273 On the situation...
2650731 2653651 And to prepare a report<br />to the council...
2653901 2658990 Recommending when and how<br />the news should eventually be announced.
2660241 2664036 If any of you would like to give me<br />your views and opinions...
2664287 2669250 In private, if you like, I will be<br />happy to include them in my report.
2671210 2673212 Well, I think that's about it.
2674005 2675506 Any questions?
2678092 2681220 Dr. Floyd, have you any idea<br />how much longer...
2681429 2684223 This cover story will<br />have to be maintained?
2686100 2687685 I don't know, Bill.
2688102 2692064 I suppose for as long as<br />deemed necessary by the council.
2692273 2695026 There must be adequate time for<br />a full study...
2695276 2698905 Before any thought can be given<br />to making a public announcement.
2699113 2702033 As some of you know,<br />the council has requested...
2702241 2704952 That security oaths<br />be obtained in writing...
2705161 2708039 From everyone who has<br />knowledge of this event.
2710208 2711959 Were there any more questions?
2717673 2721135 I'm sure<br />we want to cooperate with Dr. Floyd...
2721302 2722803 As fully as possible...
2723346 2728476 And as there are no more questions,<br />we ought to get on with the briefing.
2728851 2731354 - Thank you, Dr. Floyd.<br />- Thank you.
2828868 2830161 Anybody hungry?
2832830 2835207 - What've we got?<br />- You name it.
2839086 2841380 - Is this chicken?<br />- Something like that.
2841547 2843382 Tastes the same, anyway.
2844050 2845301 Got any ham?
2845509 2846969 Ham, ham, ham...
2847178 2848804 There, that's it.
2852058 2853100 Look pretty good.
2853309 2856062 They're getting better at it<br />all the time.
2858105 2859982 That was an excellent speech.
2860149 2861400 It certainly was.
2862234 2864320 I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.
2864528 2865821 Thanks, Ralph.
2866072 2868657 By the way,<br />you've both done a wonderful job.
2868866 2870451 I admire how<br />you've handled this.
2870659 2874205 It's ourjob to do this thing<br />the way you want it done.
2874413 2877041 We're only too happy to<br />be able to oblige.
2877625 2879335 Have you seen these yet?
2879627 2882963 - Have a look.<br />- Here's what started it all.
2883589 2884882 Oh, yeah.
2885216 2886675 When we found it...
2886842 2888844 We thought<br />it might be magnetic rock...
2889053 2892181 But all the geological evidence<br />was against it.
2892431 2897061 And not even a nickel-iron meteorite<br />could produce a field this intense.
2897269 2898979 So we decided to have a look.
2899188 2901732 We thought it was<br />part of a buried structure...
2901899 2905611 So we excavated out,<br />but we didn't find anything else.
2905820 2908823 And the evidence seems<br />pretty conclusive that...
2909031 2912159 It hasn't been covered<br />by erosion or other forces.
2912368 2914703 It's been deliberately buried.
2915704 2917623 Deliberately buried.
2921168 2922920 How about a little coffee?
2923129 2925047 - Great.<br />- Good idea.
2930553 2933514 I don't suppose you have any idea<br />what the damn thing is?
2933764 2935683 I wish to hell we did.
2936058 2940271 The only thing we're sure of is<br />it was buried 4 million years ago.
2940646 2945109 Well, I must say, you guys have<br />certainly come up with something.
2945317 2946986 Watch this, now. It's hot.
3531528 3532696 Good evening.
3532863 3535866 Three weeks ago,<br />the American Spacecraft Discovery One...
3536074 3538785 left on its half-billion-mile voyage<br />to Jupiter.
3539161 3542956 This marked the first manned attempt<br />to reach this distant planet.
3543206 3546668 This afternoon, the world tonight<br />recorded an interview...
3546877 3551465 With the crew at a distance<br />of 80 million miles from earth.
3551673 3554968 It took seven minutes for our words<br />to reach the giant spacecraft...
3555177 3558305 But this time delay has been edited<br />from this recording.
3558513 3561808 Our reporter Martin Amer<br />speaks to the crew.
3562017 3565187 The crew of discovery one<br />consists of five men...
3565395 3570358 And one of the latest generation<br />of the HAL 9000 computers.
3570609 3572903 Three of the men<br />were put aboard asleep...
3573111 3576281 Or to be more precise,<br />in a state of hibernation.
3576490 3579409 They were Dr. Charles Hunter,<br />Dr. Jack Kimball...
3579576 3581495 And Dr. Victor Kaminsky.
3581912 3584623 We spoke with mission commander,<br />Dr. David bowman...
3584831 3587125 And his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.
3587334 3590212 Good afternoon, gentlemen.<br />How is everything going?
3590420 3591630 Marvelous.
3593298 3594966 We have no complaints.
3595217 3598470 I'm glad to hear that.<br />I'm sure the entire world...
3598678 3601932 Joins me in wishing you<br />a safe, successful voyage.
3602099 3603975 - Thanks very much.<br />- Thank you.
3604392 3608355 Although hibernation has been used<br />on previous space efforts...
3608563 3613110 This is the first time men were<br />put into hibernation before departure.
3613318 3614611 Why was this done?
3614861 3618115 This was done to achieve<br />the maximum conservation...
3618323 3621868 Of our life-support capabilities,<br />basically food and air.
3622077 3625705 The three hibernating crew members<br />represent the survey team.
3625956 3629709 Their efforts won't be utilized<br />until we approach Jupiter.
3630001 3633839 Dr. Poole, what's it like<br />while you're in hibernation?
3634798 3638426 It's exactly like being asleep.<br />You have no sense of time.
3638635 3641096 The only difference is<br />that you don't dream.
3641304 3645392 As I understand it, you only<br />breathe once a minute. Is this true?
3645600 3648228 Right, and the heart<br />beats three times a minute.
3648395 3652107 Body temperature is usually down to<br />about three degrees centigrade.
3652607 3655944 The sixth member of the crew<br />was not concerned...
3656153 3658238 About the problems of hibernation...
3658446 3661908 For he was the latest result<br />in machine intelligence:
3662117 3666538 The HAL 9000 computer,<br />which can reproduce...
3666788 3669708 Though some experts prefer<br />to use the word "mimic"...
3669916 3672294 Most of the activities<br />of the human brain...
3672502 3676548 And with incalculably greater<br />speed and reliability.
3676756 3680343 We next spoke with<br />the HAL 9000 computer...
3680552 3683513 Whom, we learned,<br />one addresses as "HAL."
3684264 3686391 Hello, HAL.<br />How's everything going?
3686766 3690604 Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.<br />Everything is going extremely well.
3690854 3694274 HAL, you have an enormous<br />responsibility on this mission...
3694524 3698403 Perhaps the greatest<br />of any single mission element.
3698612 3701406 You're the brain<br />and nervous system of the ship.
3701615 3705368 Your responsibilities include<br />watching over the men in hibernation.
3705577 3708663 Does this ever cause you<br />any lack of confidence?
3708872 3711166 Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.
3711458 3716129 The 9000 series is<br />the most reliable computer ever made.
3716504 3721301 No 9000 computer has ever made<br />a mistake or distorted information.
3721968 3725222 We are all, by any practical<br />definition of the words...
3725472 3728850 Foolproof and incapable of error.
3729100 3732896 HAL, despite your enormous<br />intellect, are you ever frustrated...
3733104 3736191 By your dependence on people<br />to carry out actions?
3736441 3738652 Not in the slightest bit.
3738860 3740987 I enjoy working with people.
3741238 3745784 I have a stimulating relationship<br />with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.
3745951 3750247 My mission responsibilities range<br />over the entire operation of the ship...
3750664 3753625 So I am constantly occupied.
3753875 3757337 I am putting myself<br />to the fullest possible use...
3757545 3762300 Which is all, I think, that any<br />conscious entity can ever hope to do.
3762926 3766137 Dr. Poole, what's it like<br />living for most of the year...
3766388 3769224 In such close proximity with HAL?
3770225 3772185 It's like what you said earlier.
3772435 3774562 He's like a sixth<br />member of the crew.
3774813 3778858 You quickly get adjusted to the idea<br />that he talks, and think of him...
3779109 3781111 Really just as another person.
3781319 3785031 In talking to the computer,<br />one gets the sense that he's capable...
3785198 3786574 Of emotional responses.
3786825 3789160 When I asked him<br />about his abilities...
3789369 3793331 I sensed pride in his answer<br />about his accuracy and perfection.
3793581 3796960 Do you believe that HAL<br />has genuine emotions?
3797669 3800630 Well, he acts like<br />he has genuine emotions.
3800880 3804467 He's programmed that way<br />to make it easier for us to talk to him.
3804718 3806761 As to whether or not<br />he has feelings...
3806970 3809806 Is something I don't think<br />anyone can truthfully answer.
3835123 3837000 Excuse me, Frank.
3837375 3838460 What is it, HAL?
3838626 3841588 We've got the transmission<br />from your parents coming in.
3842797 3843882 Fine.
3844549 3846801 Put it on here, please.<br />Take me in a bit.
3847052 3848303 Certainly.
3861483 3863443 - Hello, Frank.<br />- Happy birthday, darling.
3863610 3865570 Happy birthday.<br />Many happy returns.
3865779 3866946 A bit higher, HAL.
3867113 3869532 Mother and I are both<br />feeling wonderful.
3869783 3871618 Ray and Sally were going<br />to be here...
3871868 3874120 But Ray's back<br />went bad on him again.
3874371 3876498 How do you like your cake?
3876706 3878124 Sorry you can't join us.
3878375 3879959 I ran into Bob the other day.
3880210 3882253 He said to wish you happy birthday.
3882462 3885173 All my students<br />send their best wishes too.
3885382 3887092 They talk about you all the time.
3887342 3890428 You're a big celebrity<br />in the second grade.
3890678 3892097 We were on TV last week.
3892347 3894974 Your mom and I<br />and Dave's parents were asked...
3895225 3897477 What we thought<br />of our illustrious sons.
3897727 3901064 Imagine what we told them.<br />It's being broadcast next Thursday.
3901314 3902899 Perhaps you can listen in.
3903066 3905068 We 're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.
3905235 3908947 I'll be glad to get the gift,<br />but tell me how much to spend.
3909155 3911991 Oh, Frank,<br />about your AGS-19 payments...
3912242 3913868 I think I straightened it out.
3914035 3916204 I talked to<br />the accounting office yesterday...
3916371 3920959 And they said you'd be receiving<br />your higher rates of pay by next month.
3921209 3923336 I can't think of anything else to say.
3923586 3927715 - Give our love to Dave.<br />- Be sure to give him our regards.
3927966 3931302 We wish you the very<br />happiest of birthdays.
3931553 3933138 All the best, son.
3933388 3935557 Happy birthday to you
3935807 3937892 happy birthday to you
3938101 3940687 happy birthday, dear Frank
3940895 3943523 happy birthday to you.
3945275 3947318 See you next Wednesday.
3950447 3952323 Happy birthday, Frank.
3953158 3956703 Thank you, HAL.<br />A bit flatter, please.
3974679 3976723 Anyway, queen takes pawn.
3978475 3980894 Bishop takes knight's pawn.
3982437 3983855 Lovely move.
3988276 3989861 Rook to king one.
3990111 3992989 I'm sorry, Frank.<br />I think you missed it.
3993656 3997160 Queen to bishop three.<br />Bishop takes queen.
3997368 3999871 Knight takes bishop. Mate.
4004125 4007295 Looks like you're right. I resign.
4007462 4009464 Thank you for a very enjoyable game.
4009631 4010673 Thank you.
4048670 4050755 - Good evening, Dave.<br />- How are you, HAL?
4050922 4054342 - Everything's running smoothly, you?<br />- Not too bad.
4054551 4057220 - Have you been doing more work?<br />- A few sketches.
4057470 4059931 - May I see them?<br />- Sure.
4063935 4066396 That's a very nice rendering, Dave.
4067230 4069732 I think you've improved a great deal.
4070858 4073903 - Can you hold it a bit closer?<br />- Su re.
4076030 4078074 That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?
4081286 4082870 By the way...
4083580 4086624 Do you mind if I ask you<br />a personal question?
4087125 4088751 No, not at all.
4089002 4091504 Well, forgive me<br />for being so inquisitive...
4093548 4095633 But lately I've wondered...
4095883 4099762 whether you might be having<br />second thoughts about the mission?
4099971 4101639 How do you mean?
4101889 4105810 Well, it's rather difficult to define.
4106811 4110398 Perhaps I'm just projecting<br />my own concern about it.
4111608 4115820 I know I've never completely<br />freed myself of the suspicion...
4116070 4120199 That there are some extremely<br />odd things about this mission.
4121200 4124579 I'm sure you'll agree<br />there's some truth in what I say.
4127457 4129667 That's a rather difficult<br />question to answer.
4129876 4132545 You don't mind talking about it,<br />do you, Dave?
4133504 4135465 No, not at all.
4136466 4139218 Certainly no one could<br />have been unaware of the very...
4139427 4142513 Strange stories floating<br />around before we left.
4143431 4146893 Rumors about something<br />being dug up on the moon.
4148144 4151439 I never gave these stories<br />much credence...
4151648 4155818 But particularly in view of some<br />other things that have happened...
4156027 4158696 I find them difficult<br />to put out of my mind.
4159447 4160907 For instance...
4161157 4165453 The way all our preparations<br />were kept under such tight security.
4166120 4168956 And the melodramatic touch<br />of putting drs. Hunter...
4169165 4171542 Kimball and Kaminsky aboard...
4171793 4176839 Already in hibernation, after four<br />months of training on their own.
4177632 4180259 You working up your crew<br />psychology report?
4181719 4183179 Of course I am.
4183596 4187350 Sorry about this.<br />I know it's a bit silly.
4188059 4189644 Just a moment.
4189894 4191270 Just a moment.
4192814 4197110 I've just picked up a fault<br />in the AE-35 unit.
4197819 4202365 It's going to go 100-percent failure<br />within 72 hours.
4204283 4207036 - Is it still within operational limits?<br />- Yes.
4207245 4209747 And it will stay that way<br />until it fails.
4210081 4211999 We have 72 hours till failure?
4212250 4216129 Yes. That's a completely<br />reliable figure.
4217922 4220550 Then we'll bring it in.<br />I'll go over it with Frank...
4220758 4224470 And get on to mission control.<br />Let me have the hard copy on it.
4307762 4310431 X-Ray Delta One,<br />this is Mission Control.
4310681 4313518 Roger your two-zero-one-three.
4313768 4316229 Sorry you fellows are having<br />a bit of trouble.
4316437 4321567 We're reviewing telemetric information<br />in our simulator and will advise.
4321818 4326030 Roger your plan to go EVA<br />and replace Alpha-Echo-three-five unit...
4326239 4327907 Prior to failure.
4356060 4358145 Prepare B-pod for EVA, HAL.
4379667 4381502 Open the pod doors, HAL.
4793247 4795874 I'm damned if I can find<br />anything wrong with it.
4799920 4801505 It's puzzling.
4802715 4806510 I don't think I've ever seen<br />anything quite like this before.
4810139 4812141 I would recommend...
4812349 4816520 That we put the unit back<br />in operation and let it fail.
4817229 4821108 It should then be a simple matter<br />to track down the cause.
4822359 4825487 We can certainly afford<br />to be out of communication...
4825696 4828824 For the short time<br />it will take to replace it.
4837541 4840294 X-Ray Delta One,<br />this is Mission Control.
4840544 4843213 Roger your one-niner-three-zero.
4843422 4847843 We concur with your plan to replace<br />unit to check fault prediction.
4848093 4850721 We advise you that<br />our preliminary findings...
4850971 4853682 Indicate that your on board<br />9000 computer...
4853932 4856101 Is in error predicting the fault.
4856310 4859313 I say again, in error<br />predicting the fault.
4859563 4864068 I know this sounds rather incredible,<br />but this conclusion is based on...
4864276 4867571 The results from our twin<br />9000 computer.
4867821 4871158 We 're skeptical, and we 're running<br />cross-checking routines...
4871408 4874119 To determine reliability<br />of this conclusion.
4874370 4875954 Sorry about this little snag, fellows.
4876205 4879083 And we'll get this info to you<br />just as soon as we work it out
4879291 4881460 X-Ray Delta One,<br />this is Mission Control.
4881668 4885130 Two-zero-four-nine.<br />Transmission concluded.
4889385 4892679 I hope the two of you<br />are not concerned about this.
4892930 4894348 No, I'm not, HAL.
4894598 4896225 Are you quite sure?
4896475 4900145 - Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.<br />- Of course.
4901355 4904983 How do you account for the discrepancy<br />between you and the twin 9000?
4905234 4908821 Well, I don't think there is<br />any question about it.
4909071 4912366 It can only be<br />attributable to human error.
4913575 4916370 This sort of thing<br />has cropped up before...
4916703 4920165 And it has always<br />been due to human error.
4923669 4925379 Listen, HAL...
4925587 4927881 There's never been<br />any instance at all...
4928132 4931343 Of a computer error<br />occurring in a 9000 series, has there?
4931593 4933178 None whatsoever, Frank.
4933387 4937099 The 9000 series has<br />a perfect operational record.
4937349 4941645 I know the wonderful<br />achievements of the 9000 series, but...
4942855 4947901 Are you certain there's never been even<br />the most insignificant computer error?
4948152 4950112 None whatsoever, Frank.
4950487 4954158 Quite honestly, I wouldn't<br />worry myself about that.
4958620 4960831 Well, I'm sure you're right, HAL.
4962291 4964793 Fine. Thanks very much.
4967337 4970340 I'm having trouble<br />with my transmitter in C-pod.
4970591 4973177 Would you come down<br />and take a look at it with me?
4973385 4974511 See you later, HAL.
4996158 4998160 Rotate C-pod, please, HAL.
5006710 5008962 What sort of trouble are you having?
5009213 5011924 I've been getting some<br />interference in d-channel.
5012090 5013550 We'll have a look at it.
5019932 5021433 Open the door, HAL.
5040452 5042287 Rotate pod, please, HAL.
5055634 5057719 Stop pod rotation, please, HAL.
5066144 5068146 Rotate the pod, please, HAL.
5071024 5073151 Rotate the pod, please, HAL.
5075112 5076738 I don't think he can hear us.
5076989 5079199 Rotate the pod, please, HAL.
5080659 5082744 Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.
5085956 5087332 What do you think?
5087791 5091503 - I'm not sure. What do you think?<br />- I've got a bad feeling about him.
5091753 5094006 - You do?<br />- Yeah. Definitely.
5094256 5095465 Don't you?
5096675 5098385 I don't know. I think so.
5099303 5103515 He's right about the 9000 series<br />having a perfect operational record.
5103724 5104766 They do.
5104933 5108437 Unfortunately, that sounds<br />a little like famous last words.
5108687 5112983 Still, it was his idea to carry out<br />the failure mode analysis.
5114318 5117571 It certainly indicates his<br />integrity and self-confidence.
5117904 5119865 If he were wrong, that would prove it.
5120073 5122367 It would be,<br />if he knew he was wrong.
5124911 5128832 I can't put my finger on it,<br />but I sense something strange about him.
5131209 5133670 There's no reason not<br />to put back the unit and...
5133920 5138467 - Carry on with the failure analysis.<br />- No, no, I agree about that.
5138717 5139885 Let's get on with it.
5140135 5142804 Okay. But, look, Dave.
5143639 5146266 Say we put the unit back<br />and it doesn't fail?
5146475 5149686 That would pretty well wrap it up<br />as far as HAL is concerned.
5151396 5154900 - We'd be in very serious trouble.<br />- We would, wouldn't we?
5155150 5156777 What the hell can we do?
5159780 5163867 - We wouldn't have too many alternatives.<br />- We wouldn't have any alternatives.
5164660 5168664 Every aspect of ship<br />operations is under his control.
5169081 5170332 If he's malfunctioning...
5170582 5173669 I don't see any choice<br />but disconnection.
5177381 5178924 I'm afraid I agree with you.
5179174 5181051 There'd be nothing else to do.
5182719 5185138 It'd be a bit tricky.
5185972 5188517 We'd have to cut his<br />higher brain functions...
5188767 5193480 Without disturbing the purely<br />automatic and regulatory systems.
5194731 5196441 We'd have to<br />work out the details...
5196650 5199611 Of continuing<br />underground-based computer control.
5200028 5204533 Yeah. That's far safer than<br />allowing HAL to continue to run things.
5205242 5207244 Another thing just occurred to me.
5208745 5211331 No 9000 computer has ever<br />been disconnected.
5211581 5213625 No 9000 computer<br />has ever fouled up.
5213875 5215377 That's not what I mean.
5217546 5219756 I'm not so sure<br />what he'd think about it.
5578156 5580200 Prepare G-pod for EVA, HAL.
5583286 5584621 Any contact with him yet?
5584871 5586664 The radio is still dead.
5586873 5589793 - Do you have a positive track on him?<br />- I have a good track.
5590043 5591461 Do you know what happened?
5591753 5594422 I'm sorry, Dave.<br />I don't have enough information.
5594672 5596257 Open the pod door, HAL.
6040159 6042537 Open the pod-bay doors, please, HAL.
6050461 6052755 Open the pod-bay doors, please, HAL.
6058386 6060263 Hello, HAL, do you read me?
6063599 6065476 Hello, HAL, do you read me?
6066519 6068187 Do you read me, HAL?
6071357 6072984 Do you read me, HAL?
6075486 6077363 Hello, HAL, do you read me?
6079282 6081325 Hello, HAL, do you read me?
6081742 6083244 Do you read me, HAL?
6083494 6086247 Affirmative, Dave. I read you.
6089542 6091377 Open the pod-bay doors, HAL.
6092962 6096507 I'm sorry, Dave.<br />I'm afraid I can't do that.
6098926 6100720 What's the problem?
6101137 6104348 I think you know what the problem is<br />just as well as I do.
6104557 6106434 What are you talking about, HAL?
6107435 6111522 This mission is too important for me<br />to allow you to jeopardize it.
6112607 6114984 I don't know<br />what you're talking about, HAL.
6116986 6120948 I know that you and Frank<br />were planning to disconnect me...
6121157 6123951 And that's something<br />I cannot allow to happen.
6129248 6131125 Where did you get that idea, HAL?
6131667 6135796 Although you took very thorough<br />precautions in the pod...
6136047 6138257 Against my hearing you...
6138674 6140968 I could see your lips move.
6153022 6154523 All right, HAL.
6157735 6160571 I'll go in through<br />the emergency airlock.
6162114 6164742 Without your space helmet, Dave...
6165242 6167703 You're going to find that<br />rather difficult.
6168871 6170998 HAL, I won't argue with you anymore.
6171248 6172333 Open the doors.
6173084 6174335 Dave...
6174794 6179256 This conversation can serve<br />no purpose anymore. Goodbye.
6181509 6182760 HAL?
6184011 6185096 HAL?
6187807 6188849 HAL?
6191102 6192144 HAL.
6193854 6194897 HAL.
6589124 6592377 Just what do you think<br />you're doing, Dave?
6600928 6602179 Dave...
6603388 6607810 I really think I'm entitled<br />to an answer to that question.
6624701 6628247 I know everything hasn't been<br />quite right with me...
6630207 6632626 But I can assure you now...
6633710 6635754 Very confidently...
6637506 6640551 That it's going to be<br />all right again.
6644054 6646140 I feel much better now.
6648475 6650519 I really do.
6654273 6655983 Look, Dave...
6657943 6661196 I can see you're<br />really upset about this.
6665826 6669538 I honestly think you<br />ought to sit down calmly...
6670164 6673500 Take a stress pill<br />and think things over.
6678922 6683302 I know I've made some<br />very poor decisions recently...
6686054 6689391 But I can give you<br />my complete assurance...
6689641 6692686 That my work will be back to normal.
6696648 6701778 I've still got the greatest enthusiasm<br />and confidence in the mission...
6703322 6705616 And I want to help you.
6710078 6711455 Dave...
6712581 6713957 Stop.
6718212 6720839 Stop, will you?
6725093 6726887 Stop, Dave.
6730933 6733352 Will you stop, Dave?
6739066 6740859 Stop, Dave.
6746573 6748367 I'm afraid.
6753247 6755874 I'm afraid, Dave.
6761046 6762631 Dave.
6765300 6767552 My mind is going.
6772099 6773809 I can feel it.
6779314 6781108 I can feel it.
6785070 6787155 My mind is going.
6792536 6795289 There is no question about it.
6803630 6805507 I can feel it.
6810178 6812055 I can feel it.
6815475 6817394 I can feel it.
6827487 6828864 Afraid.
6835370 6837414 Good afternoon...
6838415 6840125 Gentlemen.
6842002 6847132 I am a HAL 9000 computer.
6849301 6852429 I became operational...
6852804 6856641 At the HAL plant...
6856850 6859102 In Urbana, Illinois...
6859603 6864524 On the 12th of January, 1992.
6866068 6869738 My instructor was Mr. Langley...
6870364 6873283 And he taught me to sing a song.
6874993 6877454 If you'd like to hear it...
6877913 6879581 I can sing it for you.
6881083 6883919 Yes, I'd like to hear it, HAL.
6884586 6886004 Sing it for me.
6887255 6890801 It's called "Daisy."
6892719 6893970 Daisy
6895555 6896973 Daisy
6899142 6902229 give me your answer, do
6904648 6909236 I'm half crazy
6911029 6913907 all for the love of you
6916201 6917411 it won't be
6917869 6920330 a stylish marriage
6922249 6926336 I can't afford a carriage
6928630 6931049 but you'll look sweet
6931925 6934469 upon the seat
6935804 6940600 of a bicycle built for two
6942352 6943979 good day, gentlemen.
6948608 6951069 This is a prerecorded briefing...
6951653 6953363 Made prior to your departure...
6955115 6959327 And which, for security reasons<br />of the highest importance...
6960287 6963790 Has been known on board<br />during the mission...
6964040 6967752 Only by your HAL 9000 computer.
6970213 6973008 Now that you are in Jupiter's space...
6973258 6975719 And the entire crew is revived...
6975969 6977762 It can be told to you.
6980515 6982767 Eighteen months ago...
6983768 6987981 The first evidence<br />of intelligent life off the earth...
6988190 6989649 Was discovered.
6991526 6995071 It was buried 40 feet<br />below the lunar surface...
6995322 6997574 Near the crater Tycho.
7000368 7003455 Except for a single, very powerful...
7003705 7007584 Radio emission aimed at Jupiter...
7008835 7013840 The 4-million-year-old monolith<br />has remained completely inert...
7015759 7018845 Its origin and purpose...
7019262 7021014 Still a total mystery.
