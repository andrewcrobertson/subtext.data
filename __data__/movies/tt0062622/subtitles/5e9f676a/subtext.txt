1874 5310 - <i>Oh, our love to Dave</i>.<br />- <i>Be sure to give him our best regards</i>.
6278 9679 <i>We wish you the very happiest</i><br /><i>of birthdays</i>.
9782 11147 <i>All the best, son</i>.
23529 25326 <i>See you next Wednesday</i>.
28667 30396 <i>Happy birthday, Frank</i>.
31404 34339 Thank you, Hal. A bit flatter, please.
52925 54950 Anyway, queen takes pawn...
56662 58596 <i>Bishop takes knight's pawn</i>.
66605 68095 Rook, king, one.
68340 70774 <i>I'm sorry, Frank. I think you missed it</i>.
71911 74846 <i>Queen to bishop, three</i>.<br /><i>Bishop takes queen</i>.
75581 77879 <i>Knight takes bishop. Mate</i>.
82455 84946 Looks like you're right. Very good.
85758 87919 <i>Thank you for a very enjoyable game</i>.
87993 88982 Thank you.
127133 129101 - <i>Good evening, Dave</i>.<br />- How are you doing, Hal?
129168 132535 - <i>Everything's running smoothly. And you?</i><br />- Oh, not too bad.
132638 135630 - <i>Have you been doing some more work?</i><br />- A few sketches.
135708 137437 - <i>May I see them?</i><br />- Sure.
142148 144309 <i>That's a very nice rendering, Dave</i>.
145417 147715 <i>I think you've improved a great deal</i>.
149155 151385 - <i>Can you hold it a bit closer?</i><br />- Sure.
154260 156285 <i>That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?</i>
159532 160863 <i>By the way</i>...
161867 164427 <i>Do you mind</i><br /><i>if I ask you a personal question?</i>
165437 166904 No, no. Not at all.
167239 170174 <i>Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive</i>...
171810 174074 ...<i>but during the past few weeks</i><br /><i>I've wondered</i>...
174146 178082 ...<i>whether you might have been having</i><br /><i>some second thoughts about the mission?</i>
178150 179515 How do you mean?
181420 183411 <i>It's rather difficult to define</i>.
185057 188117 <i>Perhaps I'm just projecting</i><br /><i>my own concern about it</i>.
189862 193457 <i>I know I've never completely freed myself</i><br /><i>of the suspicion</i>...
194300 197758 ...<i>that there are some extremely</i><br /><i>odd things about this mission</i>.
199438 202635 <i>I'm sure you will agree there is some truth</i><br /><i>in what I say</i>.
205711 208202 I don't know.<br />That's a rather difficult question to answer.
208280 211044 <i>You don't mind talking about it,</i><br /><i>do you, Dave?</i>
211784 213217 Oh, no, not at all.
214720 216779 <i>Certainly no one could</i><br /><i>have been unaware of</i>...
216855 220154 ...<i>the very strange stories floating around</i><br /><i>before we left</i>.
221660 224561 <i>Rumors of something being dug up</i><br /><i>on the Moon</i>.
226398 228923 <i>I never gave these stories much credence</i>...
229935 234065 ...<i>but particularly in view of some</i><br /><i>of the other things that have happened</i>...
234273 236867 ...<i>I find them difficult</i><br /><i>to put out of my mind</i>.
237710 238972 <i>For instance:</i>
239411 243040 <i>The way all our preparations</i><br /><i>were kept under such tight security</i>...
244416 245815 ...<i>and the melodramatic touch</i>...
245884 249251 ...<i>of putting Drs. Hunter, Kimball</i><br /><i>and Kaminsky aboard</i>...
250089 254423 ...<i>already in hibernation after four months</i><br /><i>of separate training on their own</i>.
255894 258385 You working up<br />your crew psychology report?
259999 261330 <i>Of course, I am</i>.
261800 264826 <i>Sorry about this. I know it's a bit silly</i>.
266338 267737 <i>Just a moment</i>.
268173 269401 <i>Just a moment</i>.
271110 274546 <i>I have just picked up a fault</i><br /><i>in the AE-35 unit</i>.
276081 279744 <i>It's going to go 100 percent failure</i><br /><i>within 72 hours</i>.
282554 285614 - You are still within operational limits?<br />- <i>Yes</i>.
285691 288182 <i>And it will stay that way until it fails</i>.
288327 290454 Would you say we had a reliable 72 hours<br />until failure?
290529 293555 <i>Yes. That's a completely reliable figure</i>.
296368 298859 We'll have to bring it in,<br />but I'd like to go over this with Frank...
298937 302737 ...and get on to Mission Control.<br />Let me have a hard copy of it, please.
385924 388358 <i>X- Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control</i>.
388927 391191 <i>Roger to your Two-zero-one-three</i>.
391964 394592 <i>Sorry you fellows are having</i><br /><i>a bit of trouble</i>.
394666 399262 <i>We are reviewing telematic information</i><br /><i>in our Mission Simulator and will advise</i>.
400072 405339 <i>Roger your plan to go EVA and replace</i><br /><i>Alpha-Echo-35 unit prior to failure</i>.
434173 435936 Prepare B pod for EVA, Hal.
457863 459524 Open the pod doors, Hal.
871243 874406 Well, Hal, I'm damned<br />if I can find anything wrong with it.
874846 875870 <i>Yes</i>...
877983 879382 ...<i>it's puzzling</i>.
880752 884244 <i>I don't think I've ever seen anything</i><br /><i>quite like this before</i>.
888159 889717 <i>I would recommend</i>...
890395 893831 ...<i>that we put the unit back in operation</i><br /><i>and let it fail</i>.
895300 898599 <i>It should then be a simple matter</i><br /><i>to track down the cause</i>.
900305 903274 <i>We can certainly afford</i><br /><i>to be out of communication</i>...
903675 906473 ...<i>for the short time it will take</i><br /><i>to replace it</i>.
915387 917753 <i>X- Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control</i>.
918323 920314 <i>Roger your One-niner-three-zero</i>.
921259 925593 <i>We concur with your plan to replace</i><br /><i>Number One unit to check fault prediction</i>.
925964 928728 <i>We should advise you, however,</i><br /><i>that our preliminary findings</i>...
928800 931735 ...<i>indicate that your onboard</i><br /><i>Niner-triple-zero computer</i>...
931803 934067 ...<i>is in error predicting the fault</i>.
934139 936699 <i>I say again, in error predicting the fault</i>.
937409 941903 <i>I know this sounds rather incredible,</i><br /><i>but this conclusion is based on</i>...
942180 945149 ...<i>results from our twin</i><br /><i>Niner-triple-zero computer</i>.
945784 949185 <i>We are skeptical ourselves and</i><br /><i>we are running crosschecking routines</i>...
949254 951916 ...<i>to determine reliability of this conclusion</i>.
952257 954020 <i>Sorry about this little snag, fellows</i>.
954125 957094 <i>We'll get this info to you</i><br /><i>just as soon as we work it out</i>.
957162 959687 <i>X- Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control</i>.
959764 962232 <i>Two-zero-four-nine</i>.<br /><i>Transmission concluded</i>.
967205 970038 <i>I hope the two of you</i><br /><i>are not concerned about this</i>.
970809 972140 No, I'm not, Hal.
972477 973910 <i>Are you quite sure?</i>
974346 977281 - Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.<br />- <i>Of course</i>.
979184 980947 How would you account for<br />the discrepancy...
981019 983010 ...between you and the twin 9000?
983088 985921 <i>Well, I don't think there is</i><br /><i>any question about it</i>.
986858 989827 <i>It can only be attributable to human error</i>.
991463 994057 <i>This sort of thing has cropped up before</i>...
994499 997297 ...<i>and it has always been due</i><br /><i>to human error</i>.
1001506 1002734 Listen, Hal...
1003408 1006104 ...there's never been any instance at all of...
1006845 1009313 ...a computer error occurring<br />in a 9000 Series, has there?
1009381 1010973 <i>None whatsoever, Frank</i>.
1011282 1014615 <i>The 9000 Series</i><br /><i>has a perfect operational record</i>.
1015153 1019055 Of course, I know the wonderful<br />achievements of the 9000 Series, but...
1020725 1023319 Are you certain there's never been<br />any case of even the most...
1023395 1025488 ...insignificant computer error?
1026031 1027794 <i>None whatsoever, Frank</i>.
1028333 1031200 <i>Quite honestly,</i><br /><i>I wouldn't worry myself about that</i>.
1036474 1038533 Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.
1040145 1041737 Fine, thanks very much.
1044749 1045943 Oh, Frank?
1046084 1048416 I'm having trouble<br />with my transmitter in C pod.
1048486 1051319 Would you come down<br />and take a look at it with me?
1051389 1052754 See ya later, Hal.
1074079 1075910 Rotate C pod, please, Hal.
1084722 1086917 What sort of trouble have you had, Dave?
1087058 1089856 I've been getting some interference<br />in D channel.
1089928 1091725 We'll have a look at it.
1097769 1099259 Open the door, Hal.
1118289 1120086 Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
1133438 1135406 Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.
1143915 1145883 Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
1148820 1150788 Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
1152924 1154789 I don't think he can hear us.
1154859 1156724 Rotate the pod, please, Hal!
1158463 1160021 Yeah, sure, we're okay.
1163801 1165200 What do you think?
1165703 1169366 - I'm not sure. What do you think?<br />- I've got a bad feeling about it.
1169574 1171542 - You do?<br />- Yeah. Definitely.
1172076 1173134 Don't you?
1174412 1176107 I don't know. I think so.
1177148 1181482 Of course, he's right about the 9000 Series<br />having a perfect operational record.
1181586 1182610 They do.
1182687 1185986 Unfortunately, that sounds<br />a little like famous last words.
1186524 1190858 Yeah. Still, it was his idea to carry out<br />the failure mode analysis, wasn't it?
1192130 1195588 It should certainly indicate his integrity<br />and self-confidence.
1195900 1197834 If he were wrong it would be<br />the surest way of proving it.
1197902 1200097 It would be if he knew he was wrong.
1202774 1207006 Look, Dave, I can't put my finger on it,<br />but I sense something strange about him.
1209247 1211545 Still, I can't think of a good reason not<br />to put back the Number One unit and...
1211616 1215177 ...carry on with the failure mode analysis.<br />- No, no, I agree about that.
1216588 1217919 Let's get on with it.
1217989 1219820 Okay. But, look, Dave.
1221459 1224257 Let's say we put the unit back<br />and it doesn't fail, huh?
1224329 1228163 That would pretty well wrap it up<br />as far as Hal was concerned, wouldn't it?
1229200 1232658 - Well, we'd be in very serious trouble.<br />- We would, wouldn't we?
1232937 1234598 What the hell can we do?
1237642 1241942 - We wouldn't have too many alternatives.<br />- I don't think we'd have any alternatives.
1242480 1246211 There isn't a single aspect of ship operation<br />that's not under his control.
1246951 1248350 If he were proved to be malfunctioning...
1248419 1251252 ...I don't see how we would have<br />any choice but disconnection.
1255159 1256922 I'm afraid I agree with you.
1256995 1259054 There'd be nothing else to do.
1260498 1262489 - It'd be a bit tricky.<br />- Yeah.
1263768 1266532 We'd have to cut<br />his higher brain functions...
1266638 1270540 ...without disturbing the purely automatic<br />and regulatory systems.
1272577 1274340 We'd have to work out<br />the transfer procedures...
1274412 1277711 ...for continuing the mission<br />under ground-based computer control.
1277849 1281649 Yeah. That looks far safer than<br />allowing Hal to continue running things.
1283087 1285681 You know,<br />another thing just occurred to me.
1286591 1289355 As far as I know, no 9000 computer<br />has ever been disconnected.
1289427 1291622 Well, no 9000 computer<br />has ever fouled up before.
1291696 1293288 That's not what I mean.
1295400 1297868 I'm not so sure what he'd think about it.
1649250 1651343 Prepare B pod for EVA, Hal.
1654355 1655913 Made radio contact with him yet?
1655990 1657821 <i>The radio is still dead</i>.
1657892 1661157 - Do you have a positive track on him?<br />- <i>Yes. I have a good track</i>.
1661228 1662786 Do you know what happened?
1662863 1665730 <i>I'm sorry, Dave</i>.<br /><i>I don't have enough information</i>.
1665866 1667629 Open the pod door, Hal.
2111245 2113475 <i>Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal</i>.
2121455 2123719 <i>Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal</i>.
2129263 2131026 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
2134468 2136265 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
2137371 2138998 Do you read me, Hal?
2142209 2143676 <i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>
2146280 2148043 Hello, Hal, do you read me?
2150150 2151947 <i>Hello, Hal, do you read me?</i>
2152553 2154077 <i>Do you read me, Hal?</i>
2154388 2156822 <i>Affirmative, Dave. I read you</i>.
2160460 2162325 Open the pod bay doors, Hal.
2163764 2167165 <i>I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that</i>.
2169870 2171303 What's the problem?
2171972 2175237 <i>I think you know what the problem is</i><br /><i>just as well as I do</i>.
2175475 2177466 What are you talking about, Hal?
2178278 2181941 <i>This mission is too important for me</i><br /><i>to allow you to jeopardize it</i>.
2183684 2185948 I don't know<br />what you're talking about, Hal.
2187821 2191120 <i>I know that you and Frank</i><br /><i>were planning to disconnect me</i>...
2192192 2195184 ...<i>and I'm afraid that's something</i><br /><i>I cannot allow to happen</i>.
2200100 2202466 Where the hell did you get that idea, Hal?
2203637 2206834 <i>Although you took</i><br /><i>very thorough precautions in the pod</i>...
2206907 2208704 ...<i>against my hearing you</i>...
2209543 2211477 ...<i>I could see your lips move</i>.
2223824 2225086 All right, Hal.
2228629 2231120 I'll go in through the emergency air-lock.
2233000 2235093 <i>Without your space helmet, Dave</i>...
2236169 2238694 ...<i>you're going to find that rather difficult</i>.
2239740 2242038 Hal, I won't argue with you any more.
2242109 2243371 Open the doors!
2245646 2248706 <i>This conversation can serve</i><br /><i>no purpose any more.</i>
2249549 2250538 <i>Goodbye</i>.
2252419 2253477 Hal?
2659826 2662624 <i>Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?</i>
2674074 2677908 <i>I really think I'm entitled</i><br /><i>to an answer to that question</i>.
2695328 2698297 <i>I know everything hasn't been</i><br /><i>quite right with me</i>...
2700934 2702834 ...<i>but I can assure you now</i>...
2704370 2705928 ...<i>very confidently</i>...
2708208 2710676 ...<i>that it's going to be all right again</i>.
2714681 2716410 <i>I feel much better now</i>.
2719119 2720347 <i>I really do</i>.
2724958 2726152 <i>Look, Dave</i>...
2728595 2731359 ...<i>I can see you're really upset about this</i>.
2736469 2739404 <i>I honestly think you ought</i><br /><i>to sit down calmly</i>...
2740774 2743368 ...<i>take a stress pill and think things over</i>.
2749582 2753382 <i>I know I've made</i><br /><i>some very poor decisions recently</i>...
2756756 2759520 ...<i>but I can give you</i><br /><i>my complete assurance</i>...
2760293 2762818 ...<i>that my work will be back to normal</i>.
2767200 2771660 <i>I've still got the greatest enthusiasm</i><br /><i>and confidence in the mission</i>...

2780814 2781906 <i>Dave</i>...
2783249 2784375 <i>... stop.</i>
2788888 2790788 <i>Stop, will you?</i>
2795762 2797093 <i>Stop, Dave</i>.
2801668 2803329 <i>Will you stop, Dave?</i>
2809676 2810904 <i>Stop, Dave</i>.
2817250 2818581 <i>I'm afraid</i>.
